### Abstract
An epidemic surge in the incidence of obesity has occurred worldwide over the past two decades. This alarming trend has been triggered by lifestyle habits that encourage overconsumption of energy-rich foods while also discouraging regular physical activity. These environmental influences create a chronic energy imbalance that leads to persistent weight gain in the form of body fat and a host of other abnormalities in metabolic homeostasis. As adiposity increases, so does the risk of developing comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease. The intimate association between obesity and systemic metabolic dysregulation has inspired a new area of biochemistry research in which scientists are seeking to understand the molecular mechanisms that link chronic lipid oversupply to tissue dysfunction and disease development. The purpose of this chapter is to review recent findings in this area, placing emphasis on lipid-induced functional impairments in the major peripheral organs that control energy flux: adipose tissue, the liver, skeletal muscle, and the pancreas.

CONCLUDING REMARKS 393

To understand the biological perturbations created by chronic lipid exposure, one must first appreciate the contributions of different tissues to normal lipid homeostasis. In this regard it is important to note that dietary lipids are critical for normal biological functions, including energy production, membrane biosynthesis, covalent modification of proteins, and intracellular signaling. We therefore briefly review the distribution and metabolism of lipids in the fed and fasted states.

A typical meal contains lipids mainly in the form of triglycerides, with some free fatty acids, cholesterol, and other sterols. Unlike dietary carbohydrates, which are cleaved to monomeric sugars such as glucose and fructose and absorbed directly into the blood through the gastrointestinal tract, lipids enter the blood primarily via the lymphatic system as chylomicron lipoprotein particles. Digestion of dietary lipids begins in the stomach with partial hydrolysis of triglycerides and the formation of large fat globules that also contain free fatty acids, phospholipids, and sterols. As these globules enter the intestinal lumen, they are mixed with bile salts and hydrolyzed by pancreatic lipases to form monoacylglycerols and long-chain free fatty acids, which then enter enterocytes via fatty acid transporter proteins. Free fatty acids are then used as substrates for esterification of lysophosphatidic acid or monoacylglycerol, leading to formation of diacylglycerol and triacylglycerol. Fatty acids are also used to form cholesterol esters. Finally, triacylglycerols and cholesterol esters are packaged with apolipoprotein B to form lipoprotein particles, primarily chylomicrons, as well as a smaller number of very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) particles, which then enter the circulation via the lymph (2).

As chylomicrons enter the circulation, they interact with lipoprotein lipases, which are located on the luminal surface of capillary endothelial cells, resulting in hydrolysis of triglycerides to free fatty acids and monoacylglycerol. The released nonesterified fatty

TAG: triacylglycerols

As we enter the new millennium, 65% of adults in the United States are overweight [body mass index (BMI) > 25 kg/m²], and 30% are obese (BMI > 30 kg/m²) (1), reflecting similar trends in many other countries around the world. For most of human evolution, the ability to store nutrients in the form of esterified lipids [triacylglycerols (TAG)] during times of food abundance has constituted a survival advantage for times of famine and/or energy deficit. In more recent times, this “thrifty” fuel economy has been challenged by overconsumption of energy-dense foods and reduced physical activity, leading to dysfunction of major tissues and organs and alarming increases in the incidence of obesity-related diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease.

These events have led to a new emphasis on understanding of mechanisms by which chronic exposure of tissues to elevated concentrations of lipids and other nutrients may contribute to tissue dysfunction and disease development. The purpose of this chapter is to review recent findings in this area, with particular focus on changes in metabolic function induced in muscle, the liver, adipose tissue, and pancreatic islets by obesity and chronic lipid exposure.

acids (NEFA) then enter cells or bind to albumin for distribution in the circulation. Transport of fatty acids into cells can occur to some extent via diffusion across the lipid bilayer of the plasma membrane, but the predominant mechanism is protein mediated. Two major classes of fatty acid transporter proteins have been described. CD36 (also known as FAT and GPIV) is an integral membrane glycoprotein found on the surface of a variety of cells, including adipocytes and oxidative muscle fibers (3). Mice lacking CD36 expression exhibit a 60% decrease in fatty acid uptake in the heart, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissue (4). A family of fatty acid transporter proteins (FATPs) 1–6 has also been identified with no structural homology to CD36 (3, 5). Some, but not all, studies of these proteins demonstrate that their overexpression enhances cellular uptake of fatty acids. FATP family members are homologous to long-chain fatty acid–coenzyme A (CoA) synthetases and catalyze CoA activation of long-chain fatty acids to varying degrees (3). Thus it remains unclear to what extent increases in fatty acid uptake in FATP-expressing cells are a result of intrinsic fatty acid transport activities of these proteins or are secondary to the enhanced rate of CoA activation. Knockout of FATP1, which is primarily expressed in skeletal muscle, results in prevention of fat-induced insulin resistance (6), whereas knockout of FATP4 results in disrupted skin function and early death (7).

Once transported into cells and activated to their CoA esters, the metabolic fate of fatty acids varies according to cell/tissue type. In humans or other mammals that are physically fit and near their ideal body weight, the primary fate of fatty acyl-CoAs in adipose tissue is re-esterification to triglycerides, whereas the major fate of fatty acids in skeletal and cardiac muscle is oxidation to provide ATP for muscle contraction. In the fed state, the liver helps to distribute lipid by esterification of fatty acids into triglycerides and packaging into VLDL for export into the circulation and ultimate storage of fatty acids in the

adipose triglyceride pool. Pancreatic islets are equipped for both oxidation and esterification of exogenous fatty acids, but in addition, fatty acids serve both as enablers and potentiators of fuel-stimulated insulin secretion in these cells.

In fasted or other catabolic states (e.g., exercise), chylomicron levels decline, and the adipose tissue becomes the major source of fatty acids. The fall in insulin-to-glucagon ratio and increased catecholamine levels associated with fasted/catabolic states cause activation of hormone-sensitive lipase, resulting in hydrolysis of triglycerides in adipose tissue and release of glycerol and free fatty acids into the circulation. Coincident with the increase in fatty acid supply, exercise or fasting stimulates fatty acid oxidation, while simultaneously decreasing glucose utilization, via the following series of events. Glycolytic flux is decreased in liver via phosphorylation of the bifunctional protein (6-phosphofructo-2-kinease/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase) by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase, resulting in reduced levels of fructose-2,6-bisphosphate and lower 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase activity. This in turn leads to reduced flux of glucose into mitochondrial pathways and export of mitochondrial citrate to the cytoplasm. Cytoplasmic citrate is used to synthesize acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA. Fasting causes phosphorylation and activation of 5′AMP kinase (AMPK), which in turn phosphorylates and inhibits acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), the enzyme that converts acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA. The decline in malonyl-CoA concentrations induced by the combined effects of reduced ACC activity and citrate supply has two major consequences: suppression of de novo lipogenesis and stimulation of fatty acid oxidation due to the removal of malonyl-CoA inhibition of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1). Finally, stimulation of fatty acid oxidation leads to further impairment of glucose oxidation, via accumulation of acetyl-CoA, NADH, and ATP, all of which inhibit pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) by allosteric mechanisms, while stimulating pyruvate

dehydrogenase kinases, resulting in phosphorylation and further inhibition of PDH. The net effect of these changes is to increase the rate of fat oxidation and to decrease the rate of glucose oxidation. Increased rates of fatty acid oxidation in the liver also help to stimulate gluconeogenesis via allosteric activation of pyruvate carboxylase (PC) and generation of ATP for this energy-expensive process.

The interplay of various tissues in control of lipid homeostasis is perturbed in animals or humans that consume high-fat diets. With ingestion of such diets and onset of obesity, triglycerides begin to be stored at sites other than adipose tissue, including skeletal muscle, the heart, kidney, and liver. These changes are often associated with chronic elevations in circulating free fatty acids and triglycerides (hyperlipidemia). This has led to the widely accepted notion that obesity-associated tissue dysfunction, including insulin resistance and cell death, is a direct consequence of chronic exposure of tissues to elevated lipids and consequent accumulation of toxic by-products of lipid metabolism. The central goal of this chapter is to provide a critical review of studies on lipid-induced tissue dysfunction and to contrast these pathophysiologic responses with those that occur in response to physiologic states (e.g., fasting or exercise) in which circulating and tissue lipids are appropriately increased.

It is now appreciated that adipocytes play a critical metabolic regulatory role via their capacity to produce a number of endocrine hormones with potent modulatory effects on food intake, energy balance, and metabolic homeostasis. Another key event in the development of obesity-related metabolic dysfunction appears to be the failure of adipocytes to adequately sequester excess lipids, resulting in their redistribution to other organs and tissues. Finally, there is growing evidence that obesity and excess lipids activate production of inflammatory mediators by adipose tissue and the liver (and/or immune cells resident in those tissues), contributing to metabolic dysregulation in responder tissues such as skeletal muscle. This section reviews these aspects of adipose tissue and liver biology and the evidence that they play a primary role in systemic metabolic dysfunction. Figure 1 provides a schematic view of the interplay of the liver, adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and pancreatic islets in lipid-induced metabolic function.

Once considered a passive energy reservoir, adipose tissue is now recognized as an important endocrine organ that informs the brain and peripheral tissues of changes in whole-body energy status. The endocrine function of the adipocyte came to light with the hallmark discovery of leptin, a hormone synthesized and secreted by adipocytes that controls body weight through actions on both feeding behavior and energy expenditure. In 1994, Friedman and colleagues identified leptin as the mutated gene in homozygous *ob/ob* mice, which exhibit an obesity syndrome characterized by severe adiposity, hyperphagia, hypothermia, hyperlipidemia, hyperinsulinemia, and insulin resistance (8, 9). Leptin replacement in *ob/ob* mice restores energy balance by acting on central and peripheral receptors that mediate changes in feeding behavior and systemic fuel metabolism (8, 9). The ensuing decade of research has revealed a network of circulating adipokines that signal changes in adipose tissue energy status to other metabolic organs that control fuel consumption and redistribution. These

**LIVER AND ADIPOSE TISSUE AS THE DRIVERS OF METABOLIC DYSFUNCTION**

All of the major organs considered in this chapter are directly susceptible to functional impairment in response to chronic exposure to elevated lipids. However, in the setting of overnutrition and obesity in whole animals or humans, there is increasing evidence these responses are hierarchical, with adipose tissue and the liver acting as the primary or “driver” organs for systemic metabolic dysregulation, whereas skeletal muscle and pancreatic islets serve as the secondary or “responder” systems.

Obesity-related perturbations in systemic metabolic control. Under conditions of chronic energy overload (poor diet and inactivity) the adipocyte eventually fails to adequately sequester excess fuel, leading to uncontrolled lipolysis, elevated circulating nonesterified free fatty acids (NEFA) and aberrant production/secretion of adipokines. Concurrently, the liver repackages or transforms excess fuel into very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and ketones. Whereas the adipose tissue and liver operate as the primary drivers of systemic hyperlipidemia, skeletal muscle and pancreas respond to the metabolic cues by attempting to adjust energy flux and substrate selection (e.g., by elevating uptake and metabolism of lipid fuels). These adaptations allow appropriate handling of acute elevations in circulating lipids that occur in exercise and fasting; chronic diet-induced hyperlipidemia causes dysregulated mitochondrial metabolism in the responder tissues, contributing to functional impairments in insulin action and secretion, respectively.

include peptide hormones such as adiponectin (also Acrp30) and resistin and proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα). Many of these adipocyte-secreted hormones, which appear to function interdependently, have been found to correlate with diabetes and/or insulin sensitivity (10–12) and to regulate both lipid and glucose metabolism (13). For example, the two best-characterized antidiabetic adipokines, leptin and adiponectin, have been shown to decrease TAG synthesis, promote fatty acid catabolism, and enhance insulin action in both skeletal muscle and the liver. Although information on the signaling mechanisms that mediate these actions is still unfolding, growing evidence indicates both leptin and adiponectin target AMPK (14, 15),
a fuel-sensing serine kinase that plays a central role in regulating cellular energy metabolism.

With the exception of rare genetic cases, leptin levels increase with obesity as a result of peripheral leptin resistance (8, 9, 16). Impaired leptin action has been linked to increased expression of suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 (17). In contrast to leptin, circulating levels of adiponectin are reduced in a variety of obese and insulin-resistant states. Low adiponectin levels, together with leptin resistance, are thought to contribute to systemic abnormalities in both lipid and glucose homeostasis (18). Conversely, weight loss and improved metabolic control have been associated with a decline in serum leptin, improved leptin sensitivity, and increased adiponectin levels. In addition to perturbations relating to leptin and adiponectin, obesity-induced glucose intolerance is associated with increased adipocyte production of insulin-desensitizing molecules such as resistin, IL-6, TNFα, and retinol-binding protein 4 (RBP-4), all of which have been shown to induce insulin resistance in both muscle and the liver (10, 19–21). Accumulating data suggest the spectrum of hormones secreted by a given adipocyte depends on the size of the fat cell. Whereas small adipocytes preferentially secrete insulin-sensitizing hormones (leptin and adiponectin), enlarged adipocytes, characteristic of obesity, secrete higher levels of insulin-desensitizing hormones such as resistin and TNFα.

The adverse impact of insufficient lipid storage in adipose depots is clearly evidenced by the severe metabolic turmoil caused by lipoatrophy. An understanding of operative mechanisms of metabolic dysregulation in lipodystrophic syndromes has been facilitated by the creation of several strains of transgenic mice with ablation or loss of function of white adipose tissue. This has been achieved by the expression of various molecules [attenuated diphtheria toxin, a dominant negative regulator of normal adipose development (A-ZIP/F), or a truncated form of the sterol regulatory binding protein-1c (SREPB-1c)] under control of the adipose-specific promoter aP2 (22–24). Animals with ablated white adipose tissue have severe hepatic and muscle insulin resistance, occurring in concert with large increases in triglyceride stores in both tissues (25). Moreover, transplantation of normal fat tissue into aP2-A-ZIP/F mice restores insulin sensitivity (26). The restoration of insulin sensitivity appears to be mediated in part by a redistribution of fat from the liver and muscle to the adipose depot and via endocrine factors produced by the transplanted fat tissue. Most evidence points to leptin as the key endocrine mediator in these studies. Thus, leptin infusion ameliorates insulin resistance in aP2-SREBP-1c and aP2-A-ZIP/F mice (27, 28), whereas transplantation of fat from leptin-deficient mice into aP2-A-ZIP/F mice fails to improve insulin sensitivity (29). Furthermore, leptin administration to humans with severe lipodystrophy partially reverses their severe insulin resistance and hyperlipidemia (30).

Other mechanisms of interorgan communication for control of fuel homeostasis have emerged in recent years. For example, it is well known that expression of the insulin-regulated glucose transporter 4 (GLUT-4) is strongly depressed in adipose tissue but is much less reduced in skeletal muscle in animals and humans with type 2 diabetes (31). Because skeletal muscle accounts for approximately 80% of glucose disposal in the postprandial state, the diabetes-associated reduction in adipose GLUT-4 did not at first seem highly relevant to metabolic dysregulation. However, subsequent studies showed that mice with adipose-specific knockout of GLUT-4 have impaired insulin sensitivity in muscle and liver (31). The impairment in insulin action is only apparent in tissues in situ and not in excised tissue samples, implying participation of a blood-borne hormone or metabolite that mediates the effect. Whereas the impaired muscle and hepatic insulin sensitivity could not be linked to changes inleptin or free fatty acid levels (31), a subsequent study has demonstrated that mice deficient in adipose GLUT-4 have elevated levels of RBP-4 in blood that is apparently produced in part by adipose tissue. Furthermore, experimental elevation of circulating RBP-4 levels in normal mice by infusion or transgenic expression causes insulin resistance (21). Interestingly, food deprivation (fasting) also causes a form of insulin resistance and is associated with a decrease in adipose GLUT-4 expression (32). This raises the possibility that regulation of adipose production of insulin antagonists such as RBP-4, TNFα, and resistin may actually be a mechanism originally designed to prevent hypoglycemia in the fasted state, which with the advent of overnutrition and senescence in modern life has been subverted to create pathophysiology.

The liver also plays a primary or driver role in whole-organism metabolic control. For example, in rats fed a high-fat diet, hepatic expression of malonyl-CoA decarboxylase (MCD) ameliorates whole-animal and hepatic insulin resistance (16). Surprisingly, hepatic MCD expression also caused near-complete reversal of severe muscle insulin resistance, as evidenced by metabolic and signaling assays (16). MCD affects lipid partitioning by degrading malonyl-CoA to acetyl-CoA, thereby relieving inhibition of CPT1, the enzyme that regulates entry of long-chain fatty acyl-CoAs (LC-CoAs) into the mitochondria for fatty acid oxidation. In addition, malonyl-CoA is the immediate precursor for de novo lipogenesis. To gain insight into lipid-derived metabolites that might participate in the cross talk between the liver and muscle in the regulation of insulin sensitivity, metabolic profiling of 36 acyl-carnitine species was performed by tandem mass spectrometry. These studies revealed a unique decrease in the concentration of one lipid-derived metabolite, β-OH-butyrylcarnitine, in muscle of MCD-overexpressing animals that is likely a result of a change in intramuscular ketone metabolism (16). These studies have revealed a mechanism by which the liver controls muscle fuel

metabolism via modulation of circulating free fatty acid levels. (These and subsequent studies are discussed in more detail in the section below on mechanisms of lipid-mediated impairment of skeletal muscle function.) Another example of the profound effects of altered lipid partitioning in control of whole-animal metabolic status comes from studies of animals deficient in stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 activity in liver. This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of saturated fatty acids (e.g., C16:0, C18:0) to monounsaturated fatty acids (C16:1, C18:1). Knockout of stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 in ob/ob mice reverses obesity and insulin resistance in these animals (33, 34). This effect appears to be mediated by enhanced rates of oxidation of saturated versus unsaturated LC-CoAs. There is also evidence to suggest stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 deficiency results in activation of AMPK, thereby further enhancing overall rates of fatty acid oxidation (35).

Finally, there is growing evidence that adipose tissue and the liver play important roles in the regulation of insulin sensitivity via inflammatory mechanisms (36). At high doses, salicylates (aspirin) reverse insulin resistance and hyperlipidemia in obese rodents while suppressing activation of the NF-κB transcription factor (37, 38). Subsequently, it has been demonstrated that high-fat diets or obesity result in activation of NF-κB and its transcriptional targets in the liver. Overexpression of a constitutively active version of the NF-κB activating kinase, IkB kinase catalytic subunit β (IKK-β), in liver of normal rodents to a level designed to mimic the effects of high-fat feeding results in liver and muscle insulin resistance and diabetes (20). In addition, both high-fat feeding and IKK-β overexpression increase expression of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-1β, and TNFα in the liver, and lead to increased levels of these molecules in blood. Systemic antibody-mediated neutralization of IL-6 in these models partially restores insulin sensitivity (20). Interestingly, mice with IKK-β knockout in the liver are protected from diet-induced
impairment of hepatic insulin action but still develop muscle and adipose insulin resistance (39). In contrast, mice with IKK-β knockout in myeloid cells are protected against diet-induced insulin resistance in all tissues (39). These findings suggest the primary mediator of the inflammatory response to elevated lipids may be macrophages that reside within the liver and adipose depots. The precise biochemical mechanisms that link excess lipids and inflammatory responses remain undefined. One intriguing possibility is that excess lipids may trigger stress responses in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (40). Thus, markers of ER stress are elevated in the liver and adipose tissue of genetic or diet-induced forms of obesity, and this in turn is linked to activation of the c-jun amino-terminal kinases, which are known to interfere with insulin signaling via serine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1. Moreover, genetic manipulations that relieve ER stress also confer resistance against diet-induced metabolic dysfunction. The question of whether obesity-induced disturbances in ER function stem from chronic lipid overload, the anabolic pressures of hyperinsulinemia, cytokine-induced signaling, mitochondrial dysfunction, and/or other pathophysiological assaults now awaits further investigation. In this regard, it is interesting to note that several of the enzymes responsible for processing excess lipid (e.g., enzymes of lipid esterification) are integral membrane proteins that reside in the ER.

links to high or low rates of fat oxidation. Finally, we will consider potential mechanisms that connect metabolic wellness to habitual exercise, a physiological paradigm in which muscle becomes a primary “driver” of energy homeostasis.

**Physiological regulation of skeletal muscle lipid metabolism.** Before attempting to dissect the pathophysiological consequences of lipid overload, it is necessary to summarize normal adaptive responses that occur when skeletal muscle is presented with a large influx of fatty acids. This section therefore introduces several key molecular and metabolic components of lipid regulation and handling in skeletal muscle.

**Lipid-induced transcriptional reprogramming of muscle.** Under conditions of lipid influx major metabolic reprogramming occurs at a transcriptional level, which is mediated in large part by a family of lipid-activated nuclear hormone receptors known as the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) (41–43). In 1990, Issemann & Green (41) identified PPARα as the steroid hormone receptor responsible for mediating the metabolic effects of a class of drugs known as the peroxisome proliferators. Two other subtypes, PPARβ/δ and PPARγ, were subsequently cloned (reviewed in 42). The three subtypes have distinct tissue distributions that reflect their discrete but overlapping functions. PPARα is expressed most abundantly in tissues such as skeletal muscle, the heart, and the liver, where it plays a key role in regulating pathways of β-oxidation (43). PPARγ, the target of the insulin-sensitizing thiazolidinediones, is expressed primarily in adipose tissue where it activates programs of adipocyte differentiation and lipogenesis (44). Recent studies demonstrated that muscle-specific deletion of PPARγ in mice resulted in whole-body insulin resistance, suggesting the low levels of this receptor in muscle are physiologically important (45). PPARβ/δ, the most ubiquitous and least characterized of these receptors,

**LIPID-INDUCED FUNCTIONAL IMPAIRMENT OF RESPONDER PERIPHERAL TISSUES**

**Skeletal Muscle**

This section provides a current view of the molecular and metabolic networks that regulate glucose-fatty acid interactions in skeletal muscle. Emphasis centers on likely sites of obesity-associated metabolic dysfunction, as well as new insights into the long-standing debate over whether muscle insulin resistance

has been shown to regulate both fatty acid oxidation and cholesterol efflux, apparently sharing many duties with PPARα (42, 46). Recent findings also suggest PPARδ may participate in the adaptive metabolic and histologic (fiber-type switching) response of skeletal muscle to endurance exercise (47).

In both animal and muscle cell culture models, pharmacological activation of either PPARα or PPARδ results in the robust induction of lipid-regulatory genes, including several associated with lipid trafficking, interorgan lipid transport and cholesterol efflux, fatty acid metabolism, β-oxidative enzymes, uncoupling proteins (UCPs), and cross talk between lipid and glucose substrates (42, 46). Upregulation of a similar set of genes occurs in response to physiological and pathophysiological circumstances that raise circulating fatty acids, such as obesity, diabetes, overnight starvation, high-fat feeding, and acute exercise (42, 46, 48). Studies in PPARα-null mice indicate the alpha subtype is essential for regulating both constitutive and inducible expression of β-oxidative genes in the liver and heart (43). However, skeletal muscles from the PPARα-null mice exhibited surprisingly modest perturbations in lipid metabolism and retained their ability to upregulate at least some PPAR-target genes in response to starvation and exercise. The lack of a severe phenotype in skeletal muscle may be a result of functional redundancies between PPARα and PPARδ (42, 46).

**PPARγ coactivator 1 and fuel homeostasis.** In the context of this discussion it is necessary to recognize the emergent role of the PPARγ coactivators (PGC1) as master regulators of mitochondrial function and energy homeostasis. In 1998, Puigserver and colleagues (49) identified PGC1α as a PPARγ interacting protein responsible for regulating mitochondrial genesis in brown fat. Subsequent studies identified a second isoform (PGC1β) and determined that both proteins are expressed ubiquitously and function as promising coactivators of most nuclear hormone receptors, as well as several other transcription factors (50). These proteins are thereby capable of regulating several distinct biological programs. In skeletal muscle, PGC1α has been shown to stimulate mitochondrial biogenesis via coactivation of the nuclear respiratory factor (51) and to regulate genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation through interactions with estrogen-related receptor α (52). PGC1α also coactivates the PPARs (50), thereby regulating pathways of lipid metabolism, and myocyte enhancer factor-2 (51), a muscle-specific transcription factor involved in fiber-type programming. PGC1α is more abundant in red/oxidative muscle and is induced by exercise, whereas its expression is decreased both by inactivity and chronic high-fat feeding (53, 54). In contrast, PGC1β mRNA levels are unaltered by these manipulations.

**Regulation by the CPT1-malonyl-CoA system.** Upon entering cells, fatty acids are activated to acyl-CoA by one of several acyl-CoA synthetase isozymes. The subsequent transfer of long-chain acyl-CoAs into the mitochondria for β-oxidation requires the carnitine shuttle system. CPT1, which spans the outer mitochondrial membrane, catalyzes the initial and pace-setting step in this process. The acylcarnitines formed by CPT1 traverse the inner membrane via a specific translocase coupled to CPT2, which regenerates acyl-CoA upon transporting the fatty acyl groups into the mitochondrial matrix. The two CPT1 isoforms (CPT1α in liver and CPT1β in heart/skeletal muscle) exhibit distinct kinetic properties; however, both are inhibited by malonyl-CoA, whereas the other CPT family members are not.

Physiological alterations in malonyl-CoA concentrations correlate inversely with changes in β-oxidation. For example, starvation and exercise decrease tissue malonyl-CoA levels and increase fat oxidation (55), whereas, conversely, carbohydrate feeding increases malonyl-CoA production in conjunction with low fat oxidation (56).

Paradoxically, however, concentrations of malonyl-CoA measured in skeletal muscle (1–4 μM) (55) should completely inhibit CPT1 activity at all times. This is because the muscle isoform of CPT1 is approximately 100 times more sensitive to malonyl-CoA than its counterpart in liver. The question of how fatty acid oxidation proceeds in muscle despite constitutively high malonyl-CoA levels has remained unresolved. One theory suggests malonyl-CoA is compartmentalized into physically and/or functionally discrete pools synthesized by the distinct ACC1 (cytosolic) and ACC2 (mitochondrial) (57) isozymes. Thus, the pool that regulates mitochondrial CPT1 enzyme activity might be controlled by ACC2, independent of total cellular concentrations. Additionally, evidence of a malonyl-CoA-insensitive CPT1 activity in red skeletal muscle has been reported (58).

The CPT1/malonyl-CoA system is primarily controlled by three factors that impact ACC activity: glucose availability, insulin status, and the activity of AMPK, which increases in response to energy stress (e.g., a high AMP/ATP ratio) (59). Whereas glucose and insulin favor high ACC activity, AMPK phosphorylates and inactivates both isoforms of the enzyme. There is also evidence to suggest AMPK activates MCD (59), leading to malonyl-CoA degradation and disinhibition of CPT1. Muscle AMPK is activated by exercise, leptin, and adiponectin, and by the antidiabetic agent metformin, and is thus presumed to play a major role in mediating the therapeutic effects of these manipulations (18).

**Mechanisms of lipid-induced insulin resistance in skeletal muscle.** The lipotoxicity model of insulin resistance predicts that increased levels of bioactive lipid intermediates oppose glucose homeostasis by blocking insulin signal transduction. Indeed, numerous studies have reported a strong correlation between impaired insulin action and intramuscular accumulation of specific lipid species.

This section reviews current theories to explain how lipids disrupt glucose disposal, and furthermore explores the widely held view that maladaptive changes in muscle fat oxidation play a central role in driving glucose intolerance.

**Candidate mediators of insulin resistance.** In both animals and humans, elevated intramuscular TAG (IMTG) storage is well recognized as a common feature of obese and/or insulin-resistant states (60, 61). Disease-associated accumulation of IMTG droplets has been demonstrated by biochemical and histological analyses as well as by computed tomography and magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Both cross-sectional and prospective studies have found that IMTG content correlates more closely with systemic insulin resistance than with other important factors such as BMI, waist-to-hip ratio, and total adiposity (62). Most researchers agree, however, that the TAG themselves are unlikely to play a direct role in causing the associated insulin resistance. Rather, these lipid reserves may provide a source of fuel that competes with glucose as an oxidative substrate and/or contributes to the synthesis of other lipid-derived entities that directly interfere with insulin signal transduction (63).

Using ¹³C and ³¹P magnetic resonance spectroscopy to assess metabolic changes in human skeletal muscle, lipid infusion has been shown to inhibit insulin-stimulated glucose transport activity in association with intracellular accumulation of LC-CoAs and diacylglycerol (DAG), lipid molecules with known signaling actions (64). These findings triggered a flurry of research activity that focused heavily on LC-CoA and DAG as candidate mediators of insulin resistance. In many cases, muscle levels of these lipids have been shown to correlate positively with IMTG and negatively with insulin sensitivity. This has been observed in cross-sectional studies of both humans and rodents as well as in several experimental and transgenic models of lipid-induced insulin resistance (61, 63, 65).
It has also been suggested that these lipid molecules can exert a direct, negative impact on insulin signal transduction by activating inhibitory signaling cascades (63, 65). Insulin signal transduction depends on a tyrosine phosphorylation cascade that begins with autoactivation of the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase, followed by tyrosine phosphorylation of proximal targets such as the insulin receptor substrate 1 (66). At least some forms of insulin resistance appear to be mediated by a serine kinase cascade that targets the insulin receptor and/or its downstream signaling partners (66–69). In contrast to tyrosine phosphorylation, which serves to propagate the signal, serine phosphorylation acts as a blockade that prevents the signal from reaching its final destination.

Acute lipid infusion in rodents has been shown to cause marked muscle insulin resistance in association with LC-CoA accumulation, increased phosphorylation of protein kinase C-θ, and phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 on serine 307 (65). Phosphorylation at serine 307 impairs insulin receptor-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 and consequently inhibits its association with phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase. This in turn is thought to impair phosphorylation and activation of distal components of the pathway, such as protein kinase B (AKT) and glycogen synthase kinase, thus ultimately perturbing insulin-mediated GLUT-4 translocation and glycogen synthesis. Further investigations have since identified several inhibitory serine phosphorylation sites in multiple protein members of the insulin signaling cascade. In vitro assays suggest both LC-CoAs and DAG can activate several serine kinases, including protein kinase C-θ, c-jun amino-terminal kinases, and IKK-β. Moreover, inhibition of these kinases by pharmacological or genetic interventions has been shown to reverse insulin resistance in rodents (37–39, 70). Thus, strong evidence suggests this family of stress-induced serine kinases participates in the etiology of insulin resistance, possibly in

response to elevated levels of nonoxidative lipid metabolites.

Still, definitive evidence that the aforementioned lipid molecules are directly responsible for insulin resistance has yet to surface. Their associations with both the serine kinases and impaired insulin signaling could reflect coincidence rather than causation. In fact, there are a number of instances in which the relationship between IMTG, LC-CoAs, and insulin resistance has not held true. For example, muscles from exercise-trained subjects are highly insulin sensitive despite IMTG levels similar to or even higher than those found in association with obesity and diabetes (60). Likewise, both TAG stores and insulin sensitivity are higher in muscle composed of predominately red (type I) myofibers compared with white (type II) myofibers (60, 71). Furthermore, exercise intervention in type 2 diabetic patients has been shown to improve insulin sensitivity without a corresponding decrease in muscle LC-CoA levels (72). Notably, a hallmark of both exercise-trained and type I skeletal muscle is their enhanced mitochondrial density and performance (73), thus implying these properties might confer protection against lipid surplus. Consistent with this notion, skeletal muscle oxidative capacity (assessed by citrate synthase activity) has been shown to be a better predictor of insulin sensitivity than either IMTG or LC-CoA content (74).

The exercise paradigm is not the only one that has challenged the LC-CoA theory. Additionally, muscles from mice lacking the heart/muscle-specific fatty acid binding proteins (H-FABP) were found to be protected against high-fat diet-induced insulin resistance, despite the presence of LC-CoA levels comparable with those found in wild-type muscles (75). Interestingly, deletion of H-FABP resulted in dramatic decreases in muscle fat oxidation and TAG storage. Similarly, insulin-mediated phosphorylation of AKT-1 and glycogen synthase kinase-3 in muscle of high-fat fed rats could be restored by a maneuver that tended to increase rather than
decrease LC-CoA levels (16). Instead, improved insulin signaling corresponded with a sharp decrease in a mitochondrial-derived lipid metabolite (16). These observations could indicate the LC-CoAs are merely markers of other cellular events more directly connected to glucose homeostasis.

Ceramide, a sphingolipid derived from the condensation of palmitoyl-CoA and serine, has emerged as another attractive candidate mediator of insulin resistance (reviewed in 76). Similar to other lipid species (IMTG, LC-CoA and DAG), muscle levels of ceramide increase in association with obesity and diabetes, both in animals and humans. Moreover, diabetogenic agents (such as NEFA, TNFα, and glucocorticoids) have been shown to stimulate ceramide accumulation, either by increasing its palmitoyl-CoA precursor and/or inducing serine palmitoyltransferase, the enzyme that catalyzes the initial and rate-limiting step in de novo ceramide biosynthesis (76–78). Conversely, exercise-mediated improvements in insulin sensitivity have been shown to correlate with reduced ceramide levels in muscle (79).

Cell-based experiments have demonstrated that ceramide inhibits insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, GLUT-4 translocation, and/or glycogen synthesis (80, 81). These effects are associated with impaired insulin-stimulated activation of insulin receptor substrate-1, phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase, and/or AKT (82, 83). Moreover, both chemically and genetically mediated suppression of ceramide synthesis prevented palmitate-induced inactivation of AKT in C₂C₁₂ muscle cells. Conversely, pharmacological antagonists of ceramide degradation both mimicked and exacerbated the insulin inhibitory properties of palmitate. However, this mechanism has been found to be inoperative when muscle is exposed to lipid mixtures consisting of high mono- or polyunsaturated fatty acids (65). Therefore, the role of ceramide in mediating lipid-induced insulin desensitization appears specific to saturated fatty acids. It is also noteworthy

that much of the evidence linking ceramide to fatty acid-induced insulin resistance comes from studies in which cells were exposed to palmitate without carnitine supplementation. Under these conditions palmitate can be particularly cytotoxic because (when given alone) it serves as a relatively poor substrate for de novo TAG synthesis, and additionally, its use as an oxidative substrate is severely impaired by carnitine insufficiency. Thus, the experimental conditions described in some of these reports may have fueled an artifactual rise in cellular palmitoyl-CoA and ceramide levels. Further studies are necessary to determine whether this pathway is invoked by a more physiological lipid environment.

**Obesity-related impairments in substrate utilization.** Fatty acids and glucose constitute the primary oxidative fuels that support skeletal muscle contractile activity. In the context of normal physiology, this tissue exhibits a robust capacity to transition between the two substrates. Thus, skeletal muscle adapts or “responds” to a given set of metabolic and neurohumoral cues by adjusting fuel selection to match both energy supply and demand. The proposal that elevated fatty acid oxidation inhibits glycolysis and glucose oxidation was first presented by Randle et al. (84) in 1963 as the “glucose-fatty acid cycle.” Principal elements of this model hold that (*a*) provision of lipid fuels (fatty acids or ketones) promotes fatty acid oxidation and inhibits glucose metabolism, (*b*) the inhibitory effects of lipid fuels on glucose oxidation are mediated via inhibition of hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, and pyruvate dehydrogenase, and (*c*) these lipid-induced changes in metabolic regulation lead to diminished insulin-stimulated glucose transport (85). Conversely, in 1977 McGarry et al. (86) demonstrated that high glucose concentrations suppress fatty acid oxidation via malonyl-CoA-mediated inhibition of CPT1. This pathway represents a near-exact complement to the mechanism described by Randle and is thus often referred to as the “reverse glucose-fatty acid cycle.”

In more recent years the CPT1-malonyl-CoA “partnership” has been featured as a key constituent of the lipotoxicity paradigm (87), in which elevated levels of malonyl-CoA and impaired fatty acid catabolism are thought to encourage cytosolic accumulation of “toxic” lipid species that disrupt glucose control. Fitting with model, muscle insulin sensitivity correlates positively with high AMPK activity, which in turn favors inactivation of ACC, enhanced fat oxidation and diminished lipid accumulation. This model also proposes that the malonyl-CoA/CPT1 axis might be disrupted with obesity and/or diabetes. Consistent with this notion, muscle malonyl-CoA concentrations are elevated in several (but not all) models of rodent obesity, occurring in conjunction with increased IMTG levels and accumulation of LC-CoAs (18, 59). Furthermore, knockout mice lacking ACC2 have decreased muscle malonyl-CoA levels, increased β-oxidation, and protection against diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance (88). In light of these findings, it was surprising that several genetic models of diminished AMPK activity failed to exhibit defects in muscle insulin sensitivity and glucose transport/metabolism (89). However, these studies did not evaluate the impact of impaired AMPK function on tissue malonyl-CoA levels.

In humans, the relationship between malonyl-CoA and insulin resistance is less clear. Although several laboratories have shown human muscle malonyl-CoA content increases in response to a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp, in association with decreased fat oxidation (90, 91), basal levels were found to be similar in lean, obese, and type 2 diabetic subjects (92). Moreover, fat oxidation rates during hyperinsulinemic conditions were actually increased in diabetic subjects compared with control subjects, despite similarly high levels of malonyl-CoA (64, 65). Thus, whereas the malonyl-CoA/CPT1 axis plays a key role in regulating muscle lipid oxidation, it is unclear whether disturbances in

this system are an essential component of insulin resistance.

Although in many ways Randle and McGarry held similar views regarding the fundamental role of lipids in mediating glucose intolerance, Randle’s hypothesis that insulin resistance stems from increased muscle fatty acid oxidation is apparently at odds with the model put forth by McGarry and others (59, 65) predicting that obesity-associated increases in malonyl-CoA antagonize fat oxidation, thereby causing insulin-desensitizing lipids to accumulate. Adding further confusion to this subject, a survey of the literature reveals a number of inconsistent reports describing either increased or decreased muscle fat oxidation in association with obesity, thus seeming to support both possibilities. Perhaps neither is entirely correct or incorrect. To reconcile these discrepancies the concept of “metabolic inflexibility” has been proposed, holding that muscles from obese and insulin-resistant mammals lose their capacity to switch between glucose and lipid substrates (93). In support of this idea, fat oxidation (assessed by respiratory quotient across the leg) in obese and type 2 diabetic subjects compared with lean subjects is greater in the postprandial state (simulated by hyperinsulinemic, euglycemic clamp) but depressed in the postabsorptive state (94). Thus, whereas control subjects adjusted muscle substrate selection in response to a changing nutrient supply, the insulin-resistant subjects did not. Several other groups have similarly demonstrated that the increase in fatty acid oxidation that normally occurs in response to fasting, exercise, or β-adrenergic stimulation is diminished in obese and/or diabetic subjects (reviewed in 95).

Also at odds with a model in which obesity and insulin resistance link to impaired β-oxidation are a number of reports showing that both disorders are accompanied by increased expression of several PPAR-targeted genes involved in lipid catabolism (96–98). Likewise, both acute and chronic lipid

exposure cause insulin resistance in association with the induction of lipid trafficking and β-oxidative genes (46, 53, 99). Consistent with these changes in transcript levels, muscles from obese Zucker rats (100) or rats fed a high-fat diet (101) exhibit increased fatty acid oxidation when compared to the respective non-obese control groups. Interestingly, isolated mitochondria from (high-fat) diet-induced obese rats were found to have increased rates of incomplete fat oxidation, but without a coincident change in complete oxidation to CO₂ (53). Perhaps this distinction is one that bears on the aforementioned discrepancies.

Complete oxidation of fatty acids to CO₂ requires not only their entry into mitochondria and processing through β-oxidation, but also the coordinated regulation of downstream metabolic pathways such as the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and electron transport chain (ETC) (Figure 2). In the event that rates of β-oxidation exceed energy demand, excess acetyl-CoA and other acyl-CoA intermediates can be converted back to acylcarnitine by CPT2 and another key member of the acyltransferase family, carnitine acetyltransferase, which resides within the mitochondrial matrix and exhibits high specificity for short chain acyl-CoAs (102). Because these enzymes catalyze the freely reversible exchange of CoA for carnitine, they play an important role in maintaining an adequate mitochondrial pool of free CoA. The acylcarnitine esters formed by this reaction are thought to exit the matrix through the carnitine acylcarnitine translocase. Upon entering the cytoplasmic compartment, which lacks acyltransferase activity, these metabolites can either be recycled for use as an oxidative substrate, or exported from the tissue into the general circulation. Blood levels and urinary excretion of specific acylcarnitine species increase dramatically in cases of inherited mitochondrial disorders, consistent with a critical detoxifying role for this system.

Whereas mass spectrometry-based measurement of acylcarnitines has long been used as a tool for detecting inborn metabolic disorders, more recent studies have used the technology to detect incomplete β-oxidation in animal models of insulin resistance. These studies found that muscle levels of fatty acylcarnitine metabolites, measured in the fed state, were abnormally high in obese compared to lean rats (16, 53). Similar acylcarnitine profiles have been observed in muscle from obese Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats compared to lean controls. Moreover, rats fed a standard chow diet decreased muscle production of acylcarnitines during the transition from the fasted to the fed conditions, whereas in comparison, rats on the high-fat diet exhibited little or no change. Finally, the same study showed that a three-week exercise intervention in mice fed on a chronic high-fat diet lowered muscle acylcarnitine levels, in association with increased PGC1α expression, enhanced mitochondrial performance and restoration of glucose tolerance (53).

The specific role of PGC1α in permitting an efficient lipid-induced substrate switch was tested in studies that compared adaptive metabolic responses in rat L6 myocytes expressing typically low levels of PGC1α to those occurring when the gene was overexpressed (53). Similar to muscle mitochondria from high-fat fed rats, L6 myocytes exposed to increasing fatty acid concentrations exhibited disproportionate increases in the rates of incomplete (assessed by measuring incorporation of the label from ¹⁴C oleate into acid-soluble β-oxidative intermediates) relative to complete (label incorporation into CO₂) β-oxidation of fatty acids. Overexpression of PGC1α in lipid-cultured L6 cells caused production of ¹⁴CO₂ to increase and maintain pace with production of [¹⁴C]-labeled acid-soluble β-oxidative intermediates. In other words, the ratio of complete to incomplete β-oxidation was dramatically increased by PGC1α expression. Consistent with these functional assessments, cDNA microarray analyses showed that fatty acid exposure in the context of low PGC1α activity resulted in the induction of classic PPAR-targeted genes involved in lipid trafficking

Lipid-induced mitochondrial dysfunction in skeletal muscle. During conditions of overnutrition and inactivity, fatty acid influx and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-mediated activation of target genes (blue) enhance β-oxidation without an accompanying increase in tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle flux. Mitochondrial performance is further perturbed by a rising NADH/NAD ratio and depletion of both free coenzyme A (CoA) and carnitine. As a result, metabolic by-products of incomplete fatty acid oxidation (gray boxes) may trigger insulin inhibitory stress-activated serine kinases. Exercise and/or activation of PPARγ coactivator 1α (PGC1α) combat lipid stress by coordinating ligand-induced PPAR activity with the remodeling of downstream metabolic pathways (red), thereby favoring complete fatty acid oxidation to CO₂.

and β-oxidation, but with little or no change in other downstream pathways that regulate respiratory capacity. In contrast, high PGC1α expression enabled the coordinated induction of β-oxidative enzymes with equally important downstream targets (e.g., TCA cycle, ETC, and NADH shuttle systems) (Figure 2). These findings imply that PGC1α enables tighter coupling between β-oxidation and the TCA cycle.

Taken together, these metabolic studies underscore several important points. First, the accumulation of fatty acylcarnitines in muscle of obese/insulin-resistant rats implies increased rather than decreased rates of mitochondrial fatty acid uptake and β-oxidation. Second, experiments in isolated mitochondria from high-fat rats suggest that PPAR-mediated increases in β-oxidative activity exceeded the capacity of the TCA cycle to fully oxidize the incoming acetyl-CoA. This supports the idea that assessment of complete fat oxidation via measurement of CO₂ production provides only a partial view of lipid catabolism. Lastly, the acylcarnitine profiles from fed and fasted rats suggested that mitochondria from obese animals were unable to appropriately adjust mitochondrial fatty acid influx in response to nutritional status, thus supporting the observation of metabolic inflexibility in humans (94). An important question remaining is whether the high rates of fatty acid catabolism in the obese state are insufficient to compensate for increased lipid delivery, thereby allowing excess cytosolic fatty acids to impair insulin signaling, or alternatively, whether persistently high rates of mitochondrial β-oxidation directly contribute to the development of insulin resistance.

**Mitochondrial malfunction: a unifying hypothesis?** Whereas considerable controversy still surrounds the question of whether oxidative or nonoxidative lipid metabolites act as the primary mediators of insulin resistance, a universal theme emanating from both models is the concept of mitochondrial malfunction (103). This is not surprising given mitochondria serve as both the metabolic powerhouse of the cell and the primary site of β-oxidation. In recent years a growing number of studies have pointed to a strong and potentially causative connection between muscle mitochondrial dysfunction and the development of both acquired and inherited forms of insulin resistance (103–107). For example, age-related muscle insulin resistance is accompanied by decreased mitochondrial oxidative activity and lower rates of ATP synthesis, in association with increased IMTG and LC-CoA content (108). Another investigation used magnetic resonance spectroscopy to demonstrate that mitochondrial function was compromised in insulin-resistant offspring of parents with type 2 diabetes compared with age- and weight-matched controls (107). They additionally reported that insulin resistance and reduced mitochondrial function were associated with a lower proportion of type 1 muscle fibers relative to type 2 muscle fibers. Other groups have likewise found the severity of insulin resistance in obese and type 2 diabetes subjects correlated with reduced oxidative enzyme capacity, measured in muscle homogenates, and reduced activity of the ETC, assessed in isolated mitochondria (109, 110). Furthermore, transmission electron microscopy revealed smaller mitochondria in muscle from obese and type 2 diabetic subjects compared with lean controls (109).

In several reports, the mitochondrial abnormalities observed in association with obesity and/or diminished insulin sensitivity correlated with decreased muscle expression and activity of PGC1α (53, 54, 103, 104, 111). Similarly, polymorphisms in PGC1α are associated with increased risk of diabetes (112). Conversely, conditions in which muscle exhibits both high PGC1α levels and high oxidative capacity (red fiber type and exercise training) are the same circumstances in which the correlation between lipid content (IMTG and LC-CoA) and insulin resistance is disrupted. Together, these observations again point to the probability that the accumulated lipids seen in obese and diabetic subjects are merely markers of suboptimal mitochondrial function. Moreover, recent findings suggest habitual exercise combats the potentially toxic effects of lipid oversupply via the enhancement of mitochondrial performance as well as mitochondrial number (53), adaptations that are at least partly attributable to the activation of PGC1α.
What underlying mechanisms could be responsible for linking mitochondrial dysfunction to insulin resistance? One theory presented predicts that reduced oxidative capacity forces preferential partitioning of lipids away from mitochondrial catabolism and toward cytosolic accumulation of IMTG, LC-CoA, DAG, and ceramide (103) (discussed above). However, at least in the case of diet-induced insulin resistance, the weight of evidence indicates early stage defects in fuel homeostasis are associated with increased mitochondrial uptake and oxidation of fatty acids. We therefore call attention to alternative mechanisms that center on the concept of lipid-induced mitochondrial stress, which conceivably could trigger the same inhibitory serine kinases shown to antagonize insulin signaling (Figure 3).

First, we consider a modified rendition of the Randle cycle in which accelerated incomplete fatty acid oxidation, resulting from a mismatch between β-oxidation and TCA/ETC activity, disrupts the energy milieu of the mitochondria by perturbing redox status (e.g., increasing the NADH/NAD ratio) and by depleting free CoA and carnitine to critically low levels. There are in fact several lines of evidence that link increased β-oxidation to insulin resistance. Throughout this discussion we cite examples of muscle-specific transgenic mouse models that display increased rates of β-oxidation and exhibit coincident impairments in insulin sensitivity and vice versa (4, 6, 98). In the muscle-specific PPARα transgenic mice, both local and systemic glucose intolerance were observed in association with marked induction of several lipid-oxidative genes (98). Notably, the diabetic phenotype of these animals was reversed by administration of the CPT1 inhibitor ox fenicine, further implicating a role for excessive β-oxidation. Equally supportive are data from studies using PPARα-null mice. These animals exhibit decreased muscle fat oxidation, increased circulating NEFA, and elevated TAG content in several peripheral tissues (43, 46, 98). Remarkably, however,

despite this severe lipid-dysregulated phenotype, the PPARα-null mice were protected against diet-induced glucose intolerance (98, 113). These animals represent one of the few models in which elevated NEFA actually accompany improved insulin sensitivity, thus implying fatty acids are less destructive when β-oxidation is limited.

Consistent with this theory, several studies have shown that CPT1 inhibitors improve systemic insulin sensitivity, both in animals and humans (114–116). Even more intriguing, salicylates, which are thought to improve insulin sensitivity in high-fat fed rodents via their anti-inflammatory actions, can also inhibit fatty acid oxidation (117). At first glance these results may seem to contradict the finding that transgenic overexpression of ACCβ in mice conferred protection against diabetes; however, whole-body transgenic manipulations affect systemic-wide changes in lipid dynamics. Thus, similar to many pharmacological therapies, the metabolic impact on the driver organs (the liver and adipose tissue) may override the potential negative effects in muscle. Finally, a growing number of investigations have reported that L-carnitine supplementation also improves whole-body insulin sensitivity (118). One might anticipate that the therapeutic actions of L-carnitine occur as a result of increased fat oxidation. On the contrary, the supplement has been shown to enhance glucose oxidation (118), in association with increased PDH activity and improved mitochondrial respiratory function (118–122). Thus, because carnitine also participates in the export of acetyl- and acyl-CoAs from the mitochondrial matrix, the surplus carnitine may be functioning to rid the organelle of excess lipids, thereby restoring homeostatic control of the mitochondrial microenvironment.

Is there a mitochondrial-derived lipid signal that couples incomplete β-oxidation to insulin resistance? The possibility that the acylcarnitine esters might function in some sort of signaling capacity cannot be discounted. These metabolites have been shown to alter

Obesity-related metabolic dysfunction in skeletal muscle. Obesity is associated with a host of metabolic,

could conceivably participate in processes re-

natively, recent findings have implicated in-  
tramuscularly synthesized β-OH-butyrate, a  
ketone, as a novel candidate-mediator of in-  
sulin resistance (16). In this study, fatty acid  
surplus increased muscle expression of the  
mitochondrial isoform of hydroxymethylglu-  
taryl (HMG)-CoA synthase, a ketogenic en-  
zyme typically thought of as a liver-specific  
protein. Perhaps the induction of this gene  
in skeletal muscle reflects a bleed-off pathway  
intended to accommodate the lipid-mediated  
mismatch between β-oxidation and TCA cy-  
cle activity (53). Interestingly, the literature  
supports a strong inverse correlation between  

ketogenesis and glucose tolerance (84, 124–  
126). The potential role of intramuscularly  
derived ketones as local modulators of insulin  
action now warrants further investigation.  
Another attractive and highly plausible  
candidate signal is one that stems from lipid-  
induced oxidant stress. In addition to their  
principal tasks of substrate oxidation and  
ATP generation, mitochondria are also a pri-  
mary source of reactive oxygen species (ROS),  
and they play major roles in antioxidant de-  
fense (127). Catabolism of fatty acids via  
β-oxidation produces reducing equivalents  
(NADH and FADH₂) that are subsequently  
oxidized by the ETC to generate ATP. This  
process of coupled respiration also results  
in the production of ROS, in the form of  

superoxide and hydrogen peroxide. The generation of these specific ROS has been shown to increase when electron transport is slowed by a high proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane (128) (a condition that might be expected when rates of β-oxidation exceed energy demand). ROS can react rapidly with DNA, protein, and lipids, thereby inflicting oxidative damage to these cellular constituents.

Fatty acids in particular are highly susceptible to oxidative attacks and thus are easily transformed to highly reactive lipid peroxides. If not sufficiently managed, these lipid by-products can in turn cause further harm to DNA and protein targets residing within the mitochondria, ultimately prohibiting the organelle from performing at an optimal level. Furthermore, oxidant stress is known to activate several of the stress-induced kinases and transcription factors implicated in insulin resistance, including the mitogen-activated kinases, c-jun amino-terminal kinases, protein kinase C, IKK-β, and NFκB (reviewed in 129). It is therefore not difficult to imagine how a vicious feed-forward cycle could result in rapid deterioration of cellular energy homeostasis. In this light, and given that mitochondrial integrity is critical to cell survival, it could be argued that adaptations favoring increased IMTG and lowered fat oxidation, typically seen in late or more severe obesity (61, 130, 131), might operate to protect muscle mitochondria from lipid-induced insults.

Importantly, mitochondria are equipped with several antioxidant defense mechanisms, including the Mn-dependent superoxide dismutase, catalase, peroxiredoxins, and the glutathione systems (127). Additionally, there is growing support for the notion that the fatty acid-inducible UCPs (UCP2 and UCP3 in muscle) play a key role in combating oxidative stress by dissipating the proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane (128, 132). Notably, many of these defense systems have been shown to be induced by both PGC1α and exercise (133, 134). Likewise, cross-sectional studies have

found that muscle lipid peroxidation is lower in endurance-trained subjects compared with either obese or insulin-resistant subjects, despite higher rates of lipid uptake, storage, and catabolism in the latter (135). Thus, the lipid-tolerant phenotype of exercise-trained and/or type I muscle fibers may relate to a resident mitochondrial population that is better prepared to cope with oxidant stress.

In closing, although the precise molecular mechanisms that link fatty acid oversupply to muscle insulin resistance are yet unfolding, many important clues have emerged in recent years. It is clear that ingestion of high-fat diets and obesity contribute to changes in adipose and liver-derived hormones, cytokines, and metabolites that impair insulin action in muscle. Increased delivery of lipids to muscle in normal physiological cycles of fasting or exercise induces a program of increased fatty acid oxidation, which is appropriate for sparing glucose and energy requirements, respectively. However, chronic lipid oversupply seems to induce a “disconnect” between β-oxidation of fatty acids and the further oxidation of acetyl-CoA in the TCA cycle. Whereas more work is required to fully understand how these metabolic regulatory changes impinge upon insulin action in muscle tissue, recent findings support the provocative possibility that insulin desensitization depends on a signal or set of signals that emanate from events occurring within the mitochondrial compartment.

### Pancreatic Islets

As is true for skeletal muscle, the effects of lipids on pancreatic islet function, growth, and survival are complex. When applied to islets in an acute fashion, fatty acids stimulate insulin secretion in a glucose-dependent manner. These effects of fatty acids are dependent on their chain length and degree of saturation with long-chain saturated fatty acids (C16:0, C18:0) exhibiting the highest potency (136). A further, recently emergent complexity is that fatty acids may potentiate

insulin secretion either by generation of messengers during metabolism or via interaction with cell-surface G protein-coupled receptors (137, 138), or some combination of both mechanisms. Fatty acids also have chronic effects on islet cell function and survival. Thus, total depletion of islet triglyceride stores in rats with experimental hyperleptinemia (139) or by treatment with the antilipolytic agent nicotinic acid (140) results in loss of insulin secretion in response to glucose and many other secretagogues, whereas acute provision of fatty acids to the perfused pancreas of hypereleptinemic rats (85) or infusion of lipids into nicotinic acid-treated rats (141) rapidly restores secretory function. Conversely, the dysfunctional islets in animal models of obesity and type 2 diabetes are lipid-laden, with the rise in stored triglyceride preceding the onset of β-cell dysfunction (142). Moreover, chronic exposure of rodent islets, human islets, or insulinoma cell lines to fatty acids causes impairment of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (143–146). However, this effect of lipid exposure may depend on concomitant hyperglycemia (147, 148), and in the in vivo setting it may require genetic mutations that predispose to lipid damage.

To provide context for discussion of the mechanisms of lipid-induced impairment of β-cell function, we first provide a brief review of the current understanding of the glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) process in normal islets. Glucose enhances insulin secretion not by binding to a receptor on the surface of β-cells, but via its metabolism to generate second messengers that trigger exocytosis of insulin-containing secretory granules (149, 150). Classically, much attention has been focused on ATP production (and increases in the ATP:ADP ratio) as a by-product of glucose metabolism that regulates insulin secretion via closure of ATP-sensitive K⁺ (K<sub>ATP</sub>) channels that reside at the β-cell plasma membrane, resulting in turn in membrane depolarization, activation of voltage-gated Ca²⁺ channels, and Ca²⁺-mediated stimulation of granule exocytosis (149–152). However, it has become increasingly apparent that this mechanism is inadequate to fully explain the entire process of GSIS. Thus, islets treated with elevated concentrations of K⁺ and diazoxide, an agent that opens K<sub>ATP</sub> channels, are still capable of significant insulin secretion in response to changes in glucose concentrations, described as occurring via a “K<sub>ATP</sub> channel-independent pathway” (153, 154). These findings strongly imply the involvement of glucose-derived second messengers other than ATP and ADP in control of GSIS.

More recent work suggests nonoxidative pathways of mitochondrial glucose metabolism may be the source of second messengers that synergize with changes in ATP and ADP levels to regulate insulin secretion. For example, subclones of the rat insulinoma cell line (INS)-1 (155) have been isolated and characterized as having either robust or weak GSIS (156). Comprehensive analysis of mitochondrial metabolism of <sup>13</sup>C glucose by NMR-based mass isotopomer analysis has revealed no differences in pyruvate dehydrogenase-catalyzed entry of pyruvate into the TCA cycle in robustly versus poorly glucose responsive clones. In contrast, glucose responsiveness is found to be tightly correlated with pyruvate carboxylase-catalyzed anaplerotic influx of pyruvate to the TCA cycle as oxaloacetate and further participation of oxaloacetate in various pyruvate cycling pathways (Figure 4a) (157, 158). Pyruvate cycling is enabled in β-cells by a high level of PC expression and very low or absent expression of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (159, 160). Thus in β-cells, unlike the liver, anaplerotic influx of pyruvate does not lead to formation of phosphoenolpyruvate and gluconeogenesis, but rather results in resynthesis of pyruvate.

The strong correlation between pyruvate cycling pathways and the capacity for GSIS has focused recent attention on metabolic by-products of pyruvate cycling pathways as stimulus/secretion coupling factors. Prominent candidates that have been investigated include glutamate, malonyl-CoA, long-chain

Mechanisms of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and impairment by lipids. (a) Role of pyruvate cycling pathways in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). During GSIS, pyruvate derived from glucose can enter mitochondrial metabolic pathways either via pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) or pyruvate carboxylase (PC). Pyruvate that enters via PC serves an anaplerotic function and allows for egress of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates malate, citrate, and isocitrate to the cytosol, where they are recycled to pyruvate. As detailed in the text, NADPH has emerged as an attractive candidate stimulus-secretion coupling factor that would be produced by the pyruvate cycling enzymes cytosolic malic enzyme (MEc) or cytosolic isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICDc). The mechanism by which glucose-induced increases in NAPDH stimulate exocytosis of insulin-containing secretory granules is unknown but could be via service as a cofactor for de novo lipogenesis or via binding to specific signaling proteins. (b) Proposed mechanism by which chronic exposure of pancreatic islets to elevated free fatty acids leads to loss of the glucose-induced increment in pyruvate cycling activity and impairment of GSIS. In this model, exposure of islets to excess long-chain fatty acids (LCFA) results in increased expression of enzymes of fatty acid oxidation, resulting in enhanced production of acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA) in the cytosol. This high level of acetyl-CoA results in increased PC activity via allosteric activation of the enzyme, resulting in enhanced pyruvate cycling activity at basal glucose. This increase in basal cycling activity obliterates the normal glucose-induced rise in pyruvate cycling activity (15). Recent studies also suggest GPR40 receptors may contribute to lipid-induced impairment of β-cell function (161).

acyl-CoAs, and NAPDH. It was proposed that glucose-induced increases in cytosolic glutamate concentrations, achieved by conversion of α-ketoglutarate to glutamate by glutamate dehydrogenase, would stimulate insulin granule exocytosis (162). However, a number of subsequent studies by other groups have failed to establish any clear causal relationship between changes in glutamate concentration and insulin release (157, 163–165). The existence of a familial form of hyperinsulinism caused by an activating mutation of glutamate dehydrogenase seemed to buttress the glutamate signaling hypothesis (166), but it has subsequently been revealed that these mutations enhance glutamate oxidation rather than accumulation (167).

The “malonyl-CoA/long-chain acyl-CoA signaling pathway” was proposed as a mediator of GSIS on the basis of a rapid glucose-induced increase in the levels of malonyl-CoA (preceding insulin secretion) in β-cells (168, 169) and because this metabolite has a strong inhibitory effect on CPT1 activity (87).

Inhibition of CPT1 is predicted to suppress fatty acid oxidation and increase lipid esterification pathways, and possibly LC-CoA pools. However, subsequent work has clearly shown that expression of malonyl-CoA decarboxylase in insulinoma cell lines and islets blocks the glucose-induced rise in malonyl-CoA with no effect on GSIS (170–172). It has been suggested that an effect of MCD-mediated suppression of malonyl-CoA can be revealed by inclusion of fatty acids in the secretion media (172), but this has not been observed in all laboratories (171). Manipulation of malonyl-CoA and fatty acyl-CoA levels has also been attempted in the context of studies of lipid-induced impairment of GSIS, as discussed in more detail below. Thus, at the present time, the weight of evidence argues against a role of glutamate or malonyl-CoA in regulation of GSIS.

At present, the most attractive candidate second messenger for GSIS derived from pyruvate cycling pathways appears to be NADPH. As seen in Figure 4, all of the possible cycling pathways (including the pyruvate/malate cycle, the pyruvate/citrate cycle, and the pyruvate/isocitrate cycle) will result in NADPH production in the cytosol, either via malic enzyme or cytosolic NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICDc). Evidence supporting a signaling role for NADPH includes the following:

1. Glucose causes dose-dependent increases in NADPH and the NADPH:NADP ratio in rodent islets and β-cell lines, whereas NADH and NADH levels are not as well correlated (173, 174).
2. Addition of NAPDH to patch-clamped β-cells stimulates exocytosis as measured by increases in cell capacitance (173).
3. Suppression of ICDc expression by small interfering RNA (siRNA) technology reduces NADPH and the NAPDH:NADP ratio, and it strongly impairs GSIS in β-cell lines and primary rat islets (174).

The mechanisms by which changes in the cytosolic NAPDH:NADP ratio regulate insulin granule exocytosis remain to be established (159). One hypothesis is that cellular redox acceptor proteins such as glutaredoxin (GRX) or thioredoxin may be involved. Consistent with this idea, GRX is expressed at higher levels in β-cells than in non-β-cells in the pancreatic islets. Moreover, coaddition of GRX and NADPH to patch-clamped β-cells results in augmentation of granule exocytosis relative to NAPDH alone, whereas thioredoxin antagonizes the stimulatory effect of NADPH (173). Although these initial findings are intriguing, they await confirmation via manipulation of GRX expression in intact islets and β-cell lines, and the molecular links between NADPH, GRX, and the secretory apparatus also remain to be established. Another hypothesis for a role of NADPH is its participation in de novo lipogenesis as an obligate cofactor in the fatty acid synthetase reaction (159). Indeed, suppression of the NADPH:NADP ratios by delivery of siRNA for ICDc results in reduced incorporation of radiolabeled glucose into β-cell lipids (174). However, direct manipulation of pathways that convert TCA cycle intermediates to fatty acids has yielded conflicting results, such that no definitive conclusions can yet be advanced on the possible role of such pathways in GSIS.

We now turn our attention to a discussion of the mechanism(s) of β-cell failure in obesity and type 2 diabetes, with a specific focus on the deleterious effects of chronic exposure of β-cells to elevated lipid levels. A well-studied model of development of β-cell dysfunction has been the ZDF rat. These animals have a point mutation in the leptin receptor, leading to hyperphagia, obesity, insulin resistance, and, by age 11–12 weeks, frank diabetes (hyperglycemia) (142). Shortly after birth, animals are lean, and the islets are of a normal size and cellular architecture. As insulin resistance appears, ZDF rats are initially able to mount a compensatory response, manifested by an increase in β-cell mass secondary to

$\beta$-cell hyperplasia. However, as the insulin resistance worsens, islet cell mass decreases in concert with the appearance of fibrotic lesions between the islet cells. Simultaneous with the loss of $\beta$-cell mass comes a loss of $\beta$-cell function, involving an initial increase in basal insulin secretion followed by a loss of glucose's ability to stimulate insulin secretion above the now elevated basal rate of insulin release (142). Importantly, recent studies indicate the changes in $\beta$-cell mass and function observed in ZDF rats appear to closely mimic changes that occur in the progression to human diabetes (175).

The foregoing $\beta$-cell deterioration in ZDF rats is accompanied by a large accumulation of islet triglycerides, and the rise in stored lipids immediately precedes the onset of $\beta$-cell dysfunction (142). Moreover, exposure of isolated pancreatic islets or $\beta$-cell lines to elevated levels of fatty acids causes impairment of GSIS and, with more prolonged exposures, triggers $\beta$-cell apoptosis (143–146). However, prolonged feeding of a high-fat diet to normal rats (176) or mice (177) or diabetes-resistant female ZDF rats (178)—although resulting in obesity, hyperlipidemia, and severe insulin resistance—does not result in dramatic $\beta$-cell decomposition. Thus, in these models, the enlarged islet mass is sustained, and GSIS does not fail. Similarly, obese humans can manifest severe insulin resistance for many years without progression to frank diabetes, probably because of prolonged $\beta$-cell compensation. A recent study has shown that acute lipid infusion causes dramatic impairment of $\beta$-cell function in subjects with a family history of type 2 diabetes compared to no functional defect in controls with no family history (179). These findings suggest that in a nonpredisposing genetic environment, increased lipid supply may actually contribute to increased $\beta$-cell mass and function. However, in a predisposing genetic environment, chronic lipid exposure eventually leads to $\beta$-cell failure. Below we attempt to delineate those biochemical adaptations to chronic lipid exposure that constitute part of the normal compensatory response from those that may participate in the development of $\beta$-cell dysfunction.

One of the first hypotheses to emerge in an attempt to explain the link between hyperlipidemia and $\beta$-cell dysfunction was the simple idea that $\beta$-cell functional impairment is directly linked to TAG accumulation. Support for this idea came from studies showing that TAG content is inversely correlated with glucose responsiveness (144, 180) and that lipid-induced impairment of $\beta$-cell function and TAG accumulation requires coexposure to elevated glucose concentrations (147, 148, 181, 182). Also, adenovirus-mediated expression of diacylglycerol acyltransferase in rat islets causes TAG accumulation and coincident impairment of GSIS (183). More recently, a direct test of the role of TAG in $\beta$-cell dysfunction has been achieved via adenovirus-mediated expression of MCD in lipid-exposed $\beta$-cell lines and islets from ZDF rats (158). As discussed above, this enzyme catalyzes the degradation of malonyl-CoA to acetyl-CoA, thereby relieving allosteric inhibition of CPT1 by the former metabolite and “shunting” lipids away from synthesis/esterification pathways and toward mitochondrial oxidation. Exposure of the robustly glucose-responsive insulinoma (INS-1)-derived cell line 832/13 to 0.5-mM oleate:palmitate (2:1, complexed to bovine serum albumin) resulted in a large increase in TG content and a strong impairment of GSIS. Treatment of lipid-cultured cells with the virus containing the MCD cDNA prevented TAG accumulation but did not prevent lipid-induced impairment of GSIS. Similarly, expression of MCD in islets from ZDF rats significantly decreased their TAG levels without restoring GSIS. Thus, TAG accumulation per se does not explain lipid-induced impairment of GSIS, suggesting instead that this serves as a marker of another fat-mediated pathophysiologic event. Indeed, TAG storage has even been proposed to represent a protective mechanism against lipotoxicity, based on finding that palmitate, a saturated long-chain fatty acid, causes more potent inhibition of
GSIS and stimulation of apoptosis than the monounsaturated fatty acid oleate, whereas oleate is the preferred substrate for lipid esterification and TAG synthesis (184). It remains possible that MCD expression failed to remove lipid-derived metabolites other than TG that are the real causal agent for β-cell impairment. For example, the fatty acid–derived metabolite ceramide has been linked both to impairment of insulin gene expression (185) and increased rates of β-cell apoptosis (186) in lipid-cultured β-cells.

A second potential mechanism of lipid-induced β-cell failure involves uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) and the formation of ROS. Interest in this area was stimulated by studies showing that UCP2-deficient mice have enhanced glucose tolerance, whereas overexpression of UCP2 results in impaired GSIS (187). Furthermore, UCP2 expression is increased in islets of *ob/ob* mice, and breeding of UCP (−/−) mice with *ob/ob* mice results in the restoration of first-phase insulin secretion and normalization of blood glucose levels (187). Subsequently, several laboratories have shown that exposure of islets or insulinoma cell lines to elevated fatty acid levels increases UCP2 expression (188–190), whereas lipid-induced impairment of β-cell function is prevented in islets of UCP2 (−/−) mice (191). There is also evidence that lipid-induced increases in UCP2 expression are mediated by SREBP1c, whose effects are antagonized by AMPK (190, 192). Thus in the fasted state or in islets cultured at low glucose, AMPK is active and SREBP1c levels are relatively low. In the fed state or in response to an increase in medium glucose, SREBP1c is induced and AMPK activity is decreased, leading to increased UCP2 expression. Indeed overexpression of SREBP1c in islets increases UCP2 expression and impairs GSIS, an effect that can be partially reversed by siRNA-mediated silencing of UCP2 expression (190). Finally, a recent study provides evidence for regulation of UCP2 expression by Sirt1, the mammalian ortholog of Sir 2, an NAD-dependent histone deacetylase linked to longevity and metabolic

reprogramming in yeast and flies. Overexpression of Sirt1 specifically in β-cells results in decreased UCP2 expression, improved glucose tolerance, and increased insulin secretion (193).

Although the foregoing data seem to establish an important role for UCP2 in control of β-cell function and lipid-induced β-cell failure, several important questions remain. Compared with UCP1, which is expressed in brown fat and clearly involved in thermogenesis, the uncoupling/thermogenic effects of UCP2 are relatively modest (194), causing uncertainty as to the specific metabolic effects of increased UCP2 expression in the β-cell. There is evidence that UCP2 overexpression mimics the effects of chronic palmitate exposure by reducing glucose-stimulated mitochondrial membrane potential via its mitochondrial proton leak activity, resulting in impaired ATP production during glucose stimulation (195, 196). It has also been reported that palmitate increases ROS production in normal islets, and this response is not observed in UCP2 (−/−) islets (195). However, knockout of UCP2 causes an increase in ROS production, an effect seemingly at odds with the enhanced insulin secretion in these islets. Moreover, UCP2 proton leak activity appears to be activated by a specific ROS, superoxide, and impaired GSIS seen in islets with chronic exposure to elevated glucose levels (25 mM) or in *ob/ob* islets can be partially corrected by the lowering of intracellular superoxide levels by overexpression of Mn-dependent superoxide dismutase (197). Finally, another recent study presents evidence against the involvement of oxidative stress in lipid-mediated β-cell functional impairment (198). This study shows no increase in ROS (peroxide) or reactive nitrogen species in response to 72 h of exposure of rat islets to 16.7-mM glucose + 0.5-mM palmitate or oleate. Moreover, the addition of antioxidants such as N-acetyl-cysteine or pyridoxamine failed to correct lipid impairment of GSIS in these studies. It should also be noted that UCP2 expression is increased to only a modest
extent (generally in the range of 30%–100%)  
by chronic exposure of islets to elevated fatty  
acids. Thus, whereas the functional impact of  
genetic manipulation of UCP2 expression or  
chemical activation of its proton leak activ-  
ity is clear, it remains uncertain if UCP2 ac-  
tivation is an essential component of β-cell  
failure in diabetes. In particular, if UCP2 ex-  
pression is specifically increased by fatty acids,  
why do islets in normal rodents exhibit sus-  
tained compensation for insulin resistance in-  
duced by high-fat feeding, even in the face  
of hyperlipidemia? This issue requires further  
investigation.

Another possible effect of the prolonged  
exposure of islets to increased levels of fatty  
acids could reside at the level of mitochon-  
drial fuel metabolism and generation of se-  
cretion coupling factors via pyruvate cycling  
pathways. Until recently, it has been difficult  
to develop a clear picture from a survey of  
the literature in the field owing to a num-  
ber of significant disagreements. For exam-  
ple, one group has reported that islets ex-  
posed to fatty acids experience a reduction  
in PDH activity in concert with a fall in glu-  
cose oxidation, leading to the suggestion that  
a glucose–fatty acid (Randle) cycle is operative  
in such cells (144, 180, 199). However, studies  
from two other laboratories failed to demon-  
strate significant lipid-induced impairment of  
PDH activity in INS-1 cells (199) or rat islets  
(200). In the Randle hypothesis, a rise in cit-  
rate is suggested to slow glycolytic flux via in-  
hibition of 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase activity.  
However, citrate levels are reported to be ei-  
ther unchanged (199) or decreased (201) and  
phosphofructokinase activity to be increased  
(202) in various β-cell preparations follow-  
ing lipid exposure. More recently, it has been  
reported that long-term exposure of MIN-  
6 mouse insulinoma cells to fatty acids re-  
sults in a reduction of the levels of PC pro-  
tein (203). These authors also suggested the  
consequence of such a lowering of PC might  
be a reduction in “malate-pyruvate shuttle  
flux,” but this conclusion appeared to be based  
solely on a decrease in NAD(P)H autofluo-  

resence in fat-cultured cells, rather than any  
direct measurement of a metabolic pathway.  
In contrast, another group has reported no  
change in PC V<sub>max</sub> in fat-cultured islets and  
further speculated that malate-pyruvate shut-  
tle flux would be increased rather than de-  
creased because of a 60% rise in intracellu-  
lar pyruvate concentrations (200). The same  
group has also reported an increase in PCV<sub>max</sub>  
in islets from nondiabetic Zucker fatty rats  
and has suggested this would lead to increased  
pyruvate cycling, thereby possibly explaining  
the enhanced insulin secretion of such islets  
that compensates for insulin resistance (204).  
However, this conclusion was based on static  
measurement of enzyme activities and con-  
centrations of selected metabolic intermedi-  
ates rather than any direct measurement of  
metabolic flux.

In light of this confusion, more compre-  
hensive methods of metabolic analysis were  
required. The application of <sup>13</sup>C NMR to  
analyze pathways of pyruvate metabolism  
in β-cell mitochondria led to the discov-  
ery that the activity of PC-catalyzed pyru-  
vate cycling pathways can be used to dis-  
tinguish robustly glucose-responsive from  
poorly glucose-responsive INS-1-derived cell  
lines, as discussed above (157). These meth-  
ods have recently been applied in conjunc-  
tion with more traditional biochemical assays  
to gain insight into lipid-induced metabolic  
changes in β-cells (158). These studies re-  
veal that chronic lipid exposure causes a rise  
in oxygen consumption at 3-mM glucose that  
occurs in concert with an increase in endoge-  
nous substrate oxidation. Furthermore, the  
normal glucose-induced increment in pyru-  
vate cycling activity is completely ablated in  
lipid-cultured cells as a result of a large in-  
crease in cycling at basal glucose levels. Inter-  
estingly, these changes occur in the absence of  
any significant change in the rate of <sup>13</sup>C glu-  
cose oxidation in lipid-cultured versus control  
cells, at either 3- or 12-mM glucose. The co-  
ordinate increase in oxygen consumption and  
endogenous fuel oxidation at 3-mM glucose  
observed in lipid-cultured cells is probably a  
result of an increase in fatty acid oxidation. This follows from the obvious increase in supply of this substrate in fat-cultured cells and is consistent with prior studies demonstrating increased expression of enzymes of lipid oxidation in β-cells in response to chronic lipid exposure (205, 206). Acetyl-CoA generated from lipid oxidation is known to influence pyruvate metabolism via its capacity to activate PC. It would appear that this mechanism is retained in β-cells, given the large increase in PC-catalyzed pyruvate cycling activity that occurs at basal glucose in response to chronic lipid culture (158). This rise in basal pyruvate cycling activity eliminates the normal glucose-induced increment in cycling activity, with the prediction that by-products of cycling pathways such as NAPDH (discussed above) would no longer increase in response to glucose. A schematic summary of these ideas is presented in Figure 4b. This model may also explain why overexpression of malonyl-CoA decarboxylase in islets or β-cell lines cultured in normal medium (lacking exogenous fatty acids) have completely normal GSIS (170, 172, 207), in that such cells will have only limited endogenous lipid stores for oxidation, acetyl-CoA production, and activation of PC.

Further evidence for the potential importance of dysregulated pyruvate cycling in mediating lipid-induced β-cell failure comes from studies with a membrane permeant malate ester. Malate is an intermediate common to all of the potential pyruvate cycles shown in Figure 4a, suggesting its provision to dysfunctional islets and β-cell could overcome the lipid-induced impairment in insulin secretion. Remarkably, addition of dimethylmalate to lipid-cultured 832/13 cells or lipid-laden ZDF islets during static incubation insulin secretion assays caused dramatic improvement in GSIS (158). In conjunction with the clear change in pyruvate cycling evoked by lipid culture, these data provide strong support for the idea that lipid-induced impairment of GSIS is caused at least in part by alteration of the metabolic fate of pyruvate. As

for the case of UCP2, however, one must still explain the enormous capacity of islets from normal animals to compensate for systemic insulin resistance, even in the face of hyperlipidemia. As discussed above, the damaging effects of lipids may require concomitant hyperglycemia (147). This would imply that in obesity and overnutrition, transient elevations of glucose levels above normal values may occur as the β-cells struggle to deliver enough insulin to clear the large amounts of glucose and other metabolic fuels coming from the diet. As these episodes increase in frequency and severity, the full brunt of lipid-induced impairment of β-cell function is realized. A recent study also suggests the GPR40 receptor, first described as involved in fatty acid potentiation of GSIS, may also contribute to loss of GSIS in rodents fed on a high-fat diet (161) (see Figure 4b). Clearly, further studies are required to unravel the relative contributions and potential synergies of elevated levels of glucose and fatty acids in the alteration of pyruvate metabolism, and the possible contribution of cell-surface fatty acid receptors to this and other mechanisms of functional deterioration of the β-cell.

**CONCLUDING REMARKS**

In this chapter, we attempt to develop two broad concepts related to mechanisms of obesity and high-fat diet–induced metabolic dysregulation. First, we summarize studies that argue for an important primary role for adipose tissue and the liver in the disruption of metabolic fuel homeostasis. This includes a review of the important roles these tissues play in the production of hormones (adiponectin, leptin), cytokines (IL-6, TNFα), and metabolites (free fatty acids and VLDL) that contribute to impaired insulin action and secretion in skeletal muscle and islets, respectively. The second key concept is that the loss of function in the responder tissues, skeletal muscle, and pancreatic islets may be mediated in part by increased rather than decreased rates of fatty acid oxidation, in a failed

attempt to compensate for lipid overload. In the case of muscle, metabolic dysregulation occurs when TCA cycle enzymes are unable to keep pace with the increased rate of β-oxidation, whereas in islets, increased fatty acid oxidation may stimulate pyruvate cycling to an extent that obviates the normal glucose-induced increment in this pathway. We hope these views stimulate continued research toward a complete understanding of obesity-related metabolic dysfunction.

### SUMMARY POINTS

1. Strong evidence argues for an important primary or driver role for adipose tissue and the liver in the disruption of metabolic fuel homeostasis.
2. The failure of the adipocyte to adequately sequester excess fuel may ultimately precipitate the metabolic syndrome by causing systemic hyperlipidemia.
3. Lipid oversupply to peripheral tissues leads to excessive uptake, storage, and metabolism of fatty acids, eventually leading to functional impairments.
4. Lipid-induced dysfunction in the responder tissues, skeletal muscle, and pancreatic islets may be mediated in part by increased, rather than decreased, rates of fatty acid oxidation in a failed attempt to compensate for lipid overload.
5. In the case of muscle, metabolic dysregulation may occur when TCA cycle enzymes are unable to keep pace with the increased rates of β-oxidation.
6. In the pancreatic islets, increased fatty acid oxidation may stimulate pyruvate cycling to an extent that obviates the normal glucose-induced increment in this pathway.

---

### FUTURE ISSUES TO BE RESOLVED

1. Is mitochondrial stress and/or failure the principal cause of lipid-induced tissue dysfunction?
2. Do specific fatty acid species play distinct roles in causing or combating lipid-induced tissue dysfunction, and if so, what underlying biochemical and molecular mechanisms are responsible for these distinctions?
3. Can pharmacological activation of PGC1α and/or other targets that enhance muscle TCA cycle activity mimic the metabolic benefits of exercise training?
