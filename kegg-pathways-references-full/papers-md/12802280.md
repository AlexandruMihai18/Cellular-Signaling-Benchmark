Telomerase expression is the hallmark of tumor cells in which this ribonucleoprotein complex preserves chromosome integrity by maintaining telomere length and thereby prevents cell death. However, recent data support a role of the combination of p53 and telomerase inactivation in initiating genetic instability that promotes malignant transformation. Through its pleiotropic effects on infected T-cell metabolism, the human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) oncoprotein Tax plays a central role in leukemogenesis. Here, we show that Tax inhibits human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) transcription, which is the rate-limiting factor of telomerase activity. This inhibitory effect, that occurs in competition with c-Myc through a canonical c-Myc binding site within the hTERT promoter, results in a decreased telomerase activity of Tax-expressing cells. This is the first demonstration of hTERT inhibition by an oncogene. Tax, which is only expressed in preleukemic cells, triggers infected T-cell cycle and keeps these cells cycling while inactivating p53. We propose that, in combination with these effects, hTERT repression by Tax at an early phase of carcinogenesis might contribute to the massive polidy changes associated with the development of HTLV-1-associated malignancies.

## Introduction

By generating numerous gains and losses of chromosome segments, chromosomal rearrangement mechanisms are intimately linked to cancer development (Nishizaki *et al.*, 1997; Buerger *et al.*, 1999). In fact,

the generation of potentially oncogenic chromosomal abnormalities might result from the progressive telomere attrition that accompanies cell divisions (Artandi and DePinho, 2000). Indeed, telomere dysfunction generates chromosome end-to-end fusions, thus forming dicentric and multicentric chromosomes that can break during mitosis (Artandi *et al.*, 2000; de Lange and Jacks, 1999). These acquired genetic rearrangements may activate DNA damage checkpoints, leading to cellular senescence or cell death (Counter *et al.*, 1992). Accordingly, the loss of a DNA damage checkpoint, such as p53 inactivation, allows both extended cell survival and continued telomere shortening (Blasco *et al.*, 1997; Artandi *et al.*, 2000; Rudolph *et al.*, 2001). This promotes accumulation of increased chromosomal aberrations and aneuploidy, thereby establishing a procancer genotype that subsequent telomerase reactivation can stabilize, leading to malignant transformation (Blasco *et al.*, 1997; Artandi *et al.*, 2000; Rudolph *et al.*, 2001). The implication of telomere dysfunction in early carcinogenesis has been clearly documented *in vitro* and in animal models *in vivo* (Blasco *et al.*, 1997; Artandi *et al.*, 2000; Rudolph *et al.*, 2001), suggesting that telomerase inactivation could play a role in tumor initiation. Despite these observations, no clear evidence of telomerase inactivation in early human carcinogenesis, or of its mechanism, has been given to date. On the contrary, all the factors that negatively interfere with human telomerase, such as Mad (Oh *et al.*, 2000), p53 (Kanaya *et al.*, 2000), p16 (Kitagawa *et al.*, 2000), p21 (Kusumoto *et al.*, 1999), E2F-1 (Crowe *et al.*, 2001) and the nononcogenic E2 product from papillomavirus (Lee *et al.*, 2002), are known to promote cellular differentiation, cell-cycle arrest, tumor suppression and/or apoptosis.

The human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) retrovirus infects and activates T cells (Hollsberg, 1999). After a prolonged period of latency during which infected cells express Tax, proliferate persistently and harbor a high degree of genetic instability (Mortreux *et al.*, 2001), 3–5% of infected individuals develop adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL). In contrast to many other leukemias or lymphomas, ATLL cells display numerous and nonrecurrent cytogenetic abnormalities that bear striking similarities to those resulting from

telomere dysfunction observed in solid tumors, that is, unbalanced translocations, deletions, duplications or triplications (Itoyama *et al.*, 2001). Tax possesses many oncogenic properties (Yoshida, 2001). It induces the expression of numerous genes involved in the differentiation and the proliferation of T cells (Fujii *et al.*, 1991; Inoue *et al.*, 1986) and inhibits transforming growth factor β signalling by blocking the association of Smad proteins with Smad-binding element (Lee *et al.*, 2002). Furthermore, through the functional inactivation of P16INKA4 (Suzuki *et al.*, 1996) and the activation of cyclin D2 (Santiago *et al.*, 1999) and cyclin D3 (Neveu *et al.*, 1998), Tax intervenes directly in the pathway controlling T-cell proliferation.

In addition to its positive effect on cell cycling, Tax protein negatively interferes with some DNA repair functions of the host cells. Indeed, Tax inactivates in trans the promoter of human β polymerase (Jeang *et al.*, 1990) and disrupts other prominent cellular DNA repair pathways (Kao and Marriott, 1999; Philpott and Buehring, 1999). Via p53, Tax influences the transition from G1 to S phase and impairs the DNA-damage sentinel at this junction (PiseMasison *et al.*, 1998). Furthermore, Tax functionally inhibits the human mitotic checkpoint protein MAD1 (Jin *et al.*, 1998). These functional characteristics of Tax may explain its mutagenic effect on cellular chromosomal DNA, as recently evidenced *in vitro* and *in vivo* (Miyake *et al.*, 1999; Mortreux *et al.*, 2001). However, because it is expressed in preleukemic cells but silent in ATLL cells (Furukawa *et al.*, 1995; Hanon *et al.*, 2000), Tax only plays a role in the initiation of leukemogenesis (Furukawa *et al.*, 1995; Hanon *et al.*, 2000).

The human telomerase reverse transcriptase (*hTERT*) promoter contains several transcription-factor binding sites, including basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) binding sites that mediate *hTERT* transcriptional activation by c-Myc (Horikawa *et al.*, 1999; Wu *et al.*, 1999). Such consensus sequences (CANNTG), referred to as E-boxes, are also implicated in the Tax-associated transcriptional inhibition of several cellular genes (Riou *et al.*, 2000) including lck (Lemasson *et al.*, 1997), p53 (Pise-Masison *et al.*, 2000) and human beta-polymerase (Jeang *et al.*, 1990). Collectively, these data permitted to hypothesize that Tax might repress *hTERT* transcription, resulting in telomerase inactivation in Tax-expressing cells.

### Results

#### Decreased telomerase activity in HTLV-1 cell lines expressing Tax

Telomerase activity was first measured by a semiquantitative telomeric repeat amplification protocol assay (TRAP) in HTLV-1 infected and -uninfected cell lines. *hTERT* activity strongly varied between cell lines (Figure 1a). The mean relative *hTERT* activity (arbitrary units) of HTLV-1-positive and negative cell lines were 9.5 and 15.75, respectively (*P* = 0.028). Five of the

eight HTLV-1-positive cell lines expressed Tax (Figure 1a), as evidenced by Western blotting (not shown). The mean relative telomerase activity in Tax positive and -negative cell lines were 5.8 and 15.71, respectively (*P* < 10⁻⁴). These strong differences suggested that Tax expression was associated with a decrease of telomerase activity.

**Tax downregulates the *hTERT* promoter in HeLa and Jurkat cells, thereby decreasing *hTERT* expression and activity**

The above results, together with the presence of E-boxes within the *hTERT* promoter, prompted us to test whether Tax could repress *hTERT* transcription. Accordingly, we investigated the effect of Tax on *hTERT* expression by performing transient cotransfection assays with HeLa and Jurkat cells using the wild-type *hTERT* promoter-luciferase reporter plasmid TERTLuc800 and a Tax expression vector. TERTLuc800 carries the 800 bp promoter fragment from *hTERT* including the regions required for basal *hTERT* transcription (Horikawa *et al.*, 1999). This construct includes two canonical c-Myc-responsive E-boxes (CACGTG) (Horikawa *et al.*, 1999; Wu *et al.*, 1999) through which c-Myc efficiently activates *hTERT* transcription (Wu *et al.*, 1999). TERTLuc800 was transiently transfected with either empty vector (pCMV) or increasing amounts of a Tax expression vector (pCMV-Tax) (Riou *et al.*, 2000), as detailed in the Methods section. pCMV-Tax inhibited TERTLuc800 expression in a concentration-dependent manner (Figure 2a): for the lowest (10 ng) and highest (150 ng) amounts of transfected pCMV-Tax, 1.20- and a two-fold repressions of *hTERT* transcriptional activity were observed, respectively (Figure 2a). A Tax-associated *hTERT* repression was also observed with Jurkat lymphoid cell line (Figure 2b). This correlated with a decrease in cellular *hTERT* expression, as evidenced by RT–PCR amplification of the endogenous *hTERT* mRNA (Figure 2c). In order to validate these results at the functional level, we investigated the consequence of Tax expression on the capacity of endogenous telomerase to catalyze telomere elongation. A quantitative TRAP assay was performed with cellular extracts from pCMV and pCMV-Tax transfected cells. Transfection of HeLa cells with Tax inhibited telomerase activity in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 2d): for the lowest (10 ng) and highest (150 ng) amounts of transfected pCMV-Tax, 1.70- and four-fold repressions of telomerase activity were observed, respectively (Figure 2d). This demonstrated that Tax-associated *hTERT* transrepression is associated with a loss of telomerase activity.

**Tax transrepresses the *hTERT* promoter through an E-box located downstream of the *hTERT* transcription initiation site**

In order to delineate which elements within the *hTERT* promoter are required for Tax effect, we generated several *hTERT* promoter-luciferase constructs carrying

mutations in different responsive elements (Figure 3). Mutations were introduced in the two E-boxes, the DNA motifs known to be involved in Tax-associated transrepression, and in a motif that overlaps the 3' E-box, the MT-box, a novel transcription-factor binding site involved in the regulation of hTERT transcription during cell differentiation (Tzukerman et al., 2000). The negative effect of Tax on hTERT transcription observed with wild-type hTERT promoter (Figure 3, lane 1) was completely abrogated when HeLa cells were cotransfected with pCMV-Tax and an hTERT construct having a mutation within the second E-box, located between positions 21 and 26 downstream of the hTERT transcription initiation site (Figure 3, lanes 2, 3, 6, 7). By contrast, mutations introduced in the first E-box, located between positions 182 and 187 upstream of the hTERT transcription initiation site, or in the MT motif, did not significantly alter the repression of hTERT by Tax (Figure 3, lanes 4 and 5).  

on hTERT activation by the bHLH c-Myc. Transfection of HeLa cells with pCMV-Tax inhibited c-Myc-induced hTERT expression in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 4a). We next tested the effect of c-Myc overexpression on hTERT transrepression by Tax. c-Myc was found to counteract the negative effect of Tax on hTERT expression in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 4b). A comparative Western-blot analysis of HeLa cell extracts transiently transfected with Tax and/or c-Myc expression plasmids demonstrated that Tax-mediated repression of c-Myc-dependent hTERT transcription was not because of an inhibition of c-Myc expression while c-Myc did not inhibit Tax synthesis (Figure 4c). Therefore, Tax and c-Myc appear to compete for hTERT expression.  

Downregulation of telomerase activity in fresh lymphocytes transduced with a lentiviral vector expressing Tax  

Having characterized the effect of Tax on hTERT transcription and telomerase activity in cell lines, we subsequently analysed telomerase activity in fresh, Tax-expressing PBMCs, the natural host cells for HTLV-1 infection in vivo (Nagai et al., 2001). Hence, fresh

CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, separated from the PBL of a healthy HTLV-1 seronegative blood donor, were transduced with a Tax recombinant nonreplicative HIV-1 vector containing the central DNA flap sequence (Zennou *et al.*, 2000). At 48 h from transduction and PHA stimulation, Tax-transduced cells and control cells transduced with a GFP recombinant HIV-1 vector were tested for telomerase activity. A strong inhibition of telomerase activity characterized Tax-transduced cells, when compared to control cells (Figure 5).

## Discussion

Present results are the first evidence of $hTERT$ repression by a viral oncoprotein, thus displaying a molecular basis for $hTERT$ inhibition at the premalignant stage of human cancers. Since $hTERT$ is physiologically expressed by T-cell activation (Liu *et al.*, 1999), the effects of Tax on T cells may appear paradoxical: on the one hand Tax triggers T-cell activation (Hollsberg, 1999) and proliferation (Mortreux *et al.*, 2001, 2003; Yoshida, 2001), while on the other hand it blocks $hTERT$ expression and thereby telomerase activity (present results). Theoretically, these two signals considered as contradictory for a T cell are synergic for triggering telomere attrition, thereby driving the cell towards apoptosis or permanent growth arrest through the p53 checkpoint (Saretzki *et al.*, 1999). However, nontransformed HTLV-1-infected T cells undergo Tax-mediated p53 inhibition (Uittenbogaard *et al.*, 1995; PiseMasison *et al.*, 1998; Pise-Masison *et al.*, 2000; Yoshida, 2001) that mainly results from a competition between Tax and p53 for CBP/P300 binding (Pise-Masison *et al.*, 2000). In addition, although harboring a significant decrease of Tax expression, ATLL cells regularly remain deficient for p53 function. Hence, mutations of p53 are found in 20–40% of ATLL (Nagai *et al.*, 1991; Cesaran *et al.*, 1992; Sakashita *et al.*, 1992; Nishimura *et al.*, 1995). Even in the absence of p53 mutations, HTLV-1-transformed lymphocytes are characterized by p53 inactivation (Reid *et al.*, 1993; Takemoto *et al.*, 2000). Together with the present results, these data make it possible to propose that by inhibiting both p53 and $hTERT$ in persistently proliferating cells (Cavrois *et al.*, 1998), Tax fosters persistent telomere dysfunction, thereby allowing accumulation of increased unbalanced chromosomal rearrangements (Blasco *et al.*, 1997; Artandi *et al.*, 2000; Rudolph *et al.*, 2001) which, if coupled with accumulating somatic mutations (Mortreux *et al.*, 2001), help move the cell towards the malignant genotype. Additional events, including accumulating stochastic mutations (Mortreux *et al.*, 2001), persistent p53 inactivation and decreased Tax expression (Furukawa *et al.*, 1995; Hanon *et al.*, 2000), are thought to allow telomerase reactivation (Uchida *et al.*, 1999), thus endowing infected cells with immortal growth potential, stabilizing the genome and finally leading to ATLL.

Figure 3 Tax transrepresses the hTERT promoter through an E-box located between positions 21 and 26 downstream of the hTERT transcription initiation site. Both E-boxes (CACGTG) and the MT motif (CGTGGGAAGC), that overlap with the 3'E-box, are represented on the left. Coordinates are those of the hTERT sequence (Horikawa *et al.*, 1999) (top). The seven hTERT reporter plasmids correspond to the wild-type hTERT promoter (lane 1) and to six additional plasmids carrying mutations (lanes 2–7). Black and open boxes correspond to nonmutated and mutated transcription-factor binding sites, respectively. Mutation positions are indicated for each construct. Transfection, luciferase detection and normalization were performed as detailed in the Methods section. Each of the seven hTERT constructs was transfected in combination with the pCMV-Tax plasmid or the control vector (pCMV). For each lane, the result shown is expressed as the fold activation of luciferase activity in cells transfected with the corresponding hTERT construct and pCMV.

In contrast to Tax, other viral oncoproteins such as the E6 product of the human papilloma virus (HPV) type 16 (Klingelhutz *et al.*, 1996) and the latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA) of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpes virus (Knight *et al.*, 2001) have been found to transactivate hTERT expression. In fact, these differences are consistent with and highlight the distinct oncogenic strategies used by these viruses. While E6 and LANA, both from DNA viruses, are continuously expressed in tumor cells (Klingelhutz *et al.*, 1996; Knight *et al.*, 2001), Tax is only expressed during the premalignant phase of ATLL (Furukawa *et al.*, 1995; Hanon *et al.*, 2000). Thus, via hTERT transactivation, LANA and E6 contribute to maintaining the malignant phenotype, whereas hTERT repression by Tax is restricted to early carcinogenesis.

Like ATLL, many cancers are preceded by a prolonged period of latency and display complex chromosomal abnormalities. We speculate that other carcinogens might play the same role as Tax and initiate malignant transformation by inactivating telomerase activity. Finally, dissecting the mechanisms by which Tax represses hTERT should help to better understand early carcinogenesis.

### Methods

#### Plasmids  
pMT2Tmyc and pCMV-Tax plasmids were described previously (Smith and Greene, 1990; Wu *et al.*, 1999). hTERT luciferase reporter plasmids correspond to the wild-type hTERT promoter TERTLuc800 (Figure 3, lane 1) and six additional plasmids carrying mutations. SM (lane 4) and DM (lane 2) were previously described (Wu *et al.*, 1999). M1-4 (lanes 3, 5–7) were generated by site-directed PCR mutagenesis.

#### Mutagenesis  
M1–M4 plasmids were constructed using the QuickChange XL site-directed mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 10 ng plasmid template and 125 ng of each primer were incubated in a final volume of 50 μl. Each construct was sequenced to confirm incorporated mutations.

#### Cells, transfections and reporter assay  
HeLa cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate precipitation method (Webster *et al.*, 2000), while Jurkat cells were transfected using Superfect (Qiagen, Courtaboeuf, France) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The total amount of transfected DNA and pCMV or pMT2T sequences were kept constant in each experiment. A plasmid expressing the secreted placental alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) was also transfected in each experiment to serve as an internal control for transfection efficiency. At 48 h after transfection, cells were collected and transcriptional activity was assayed as a function of luciferase activity (Nordeen, 1988). Results were expressed as the induction of luciferase activity (Luciferase Assay System, Promega, Madison, WI, USA) of the hTERT promoter construct over pCMV and were normalized to SEAP activity (AP Chemiluminescent Reporter Gene Assay, ICN Pharmaceuticals, Costa Mesa, CA, USA). Data shown in Oncogene.

Figures 2a, b, 3 and 4a, b are the means (±s.d.) of one representative experiment performed in triplicate.

**Western blot**  
Cells were lysed and protein concentration was assayed using the Bio-rad Dc Protein Assay Kit (Bio-rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Equal amounts of proteins were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate 8% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Fractionated proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes (Immobilon-P Transfer Membranes, Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA). Membranes were blocked in PBS containing 5% nonfat milk, 0.2% Tween 20, then probed with the appropriate antibody: Tax monoclonal antibody HY474, c-Myc monoclonal antibody Anti-myc (Invitrogen) and monoclonal anti-actin (AC-40 or AC-15, Sigma, Saint Louis, MI, USA), followed with the anti-mouse IgG HRP-linked antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA, USA). Blots were then

isolation System (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized using the M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen, Groningen, the Netherlands) and 75–150 ng cDNA was subjected to 30 cycles of PCR in a total volume of 50 μl. The following sequences of primers were used: forward primer: 5′-TGAAC TTGCGGAAGACAGTG-3′ (*hTERT*), 5′-CGGATACC CAGTCTACGTGT-3′ (*tax*), 5′-GGCATGGTC ACCAACTGGGACGAC-3′ (*actin*), and reverse primer: 5′-ACATGCGTGAAAACCTGTACG-3′ (*hTERT*), 5′-GAGCCGATAACGCGTCCATCG-3′ (*tax*), 5′-ATT TGC GGGTGGACGATGGGAGGGGC-3′ (*actin*). *Actin*, *Tax* and *hTERT* RT-PCR products shown in Figure 2c are derived from the exponential phase of the amplification.

### Retroviral transduction

Peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) obtained from a healthy donor were stimulated with 1 mg/ml of phytohemagglutinin (Wellcome, Research Triangle Park, NC, USA), and then maintained in the presence of interleukin-2 (10% lymphocult; Biotest Diagnostics, Denville, NJ, USA). CD4⁺ T cells or CD8⁺ T cells were negatively selected from PBLs with magnetic beads (MACS CD41 or CD81 T-cell isolation kit; Miltenyi Biotech, Paris, France) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. CD4⁺ and CD8⁺ T cells were transduced with a Tax recombinant nonreplicative HIV-1 vector or a GFP control vector, both carrying the central DNA flap sequence, as described (Zennou *et al.*, 2000; Royer-Leveau *et al.*, 2002). Transductions were conducted at a vector particle concentration of 500 ng P24/ml. Transduction efficiencies were superior to 80% in all cases (not shown). Telomerase activity was measured at 48 h after stimulation with 1 mg/ml of phytohemagglutinin.

### Telomeric repeat amplification protocol (TRAP) assays

Cell lysate preparation (approximately 4 μg of protein per sample) and TRAP assay using ³²P-labelled primers (TRAP Assay, Pharmingen, San Diego, CA, USA) were carried out according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Band quantitation was performed by laser densitometric scanning of X-ray films exposed in the linear range (Figure 1a). For transfected HeLa cells (Figure 2d), telomerase activity was quantified on cellular extracts (0.5 μg) by a TRAP-ELISA assay (Roche, Indianapolis, IN, USA), as described (Gauthier *et al.*, 2001). TRAP products were quantified by absorbency reading of the reaction mixtures at 450 nm. Results were expressed as the induction of cellular telomerase activity and were normalized to SEAP activity.

### PCR

*hTERT* and *Tax* expressions were assayed by RT-PCR (Figure 2c). *Actin* mRNA was amplified as control. RNA was extracted from transfected cells using the SV total RNA
