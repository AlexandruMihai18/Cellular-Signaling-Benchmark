The cerebellum is a central organ in the control of motor learning and performance. In this respect, the cellular plasticity model systems of multiple climbing fiber elimination and long-term depression have been intensively studied. The signalling pathways involved in these plastic changes are now well understood on a molecular level and protein kinase C (PKC) activity appears to be crucially involved in both processes. Furthermore, as shown in recent studies, Purkinje cell dendritic development also critically depends on the activity of PKC. Thereby, the Ca²⁺-dependent PKC subtypes, activated by synaptic inputs through metabotropic glutamate receptors, trigger functional changes as well as long-term anatomical maturation of the Purkinje cell dendritic tree during cerebellar development at different time levels. This review summarizes these findings and forwards the hypothesis of a link between the functional mechanisms underlying LTD and the differentiation of Purkinje cell dendrites.

## Introduction

The cerebellum has for a long time been a favourite model system to study neuronal function and plasticity. Due to its orderly and precise organization it has been possible to dissect neuronal circuits underlying simple behavioural responses like for example eyeblink conditioning, which is considered to be a simple form of motor learning.¹ Two important cellular model systems of neuronal plasticity have been intensively studied in the cerebellum: the elimination of multiple innervation of Purkinje cells by climbing fibers from the inferior olive² and long-term depression (LTD) at parallel fibre-Purkinje cell synapses.³ Similarly, the morphological differentiation of Purkinje cell dendrites has been a unique model system for the study of the role of afferent innervation for dendritic differentiation. Because parallel fibers, the main afferents of Purkinje cells, can be virtually eliminated by neonatal X-irradiation and are strongly reduced in the *weaver* mutant mouse the development of Purkinje cell dendrites in the absence of a major afferent fibre system has been described in great detail.⁴ Due to the availability of mouse models deficient in specific genes involved in LTD and multiple climbing fiber elimination there is now a good understanding of some of the plastic changes at the molecular level. Activity of protein kinase C (PKC) appears to be involved in both of these processes. Recent studies have also shown that PKC may play an important role for dendritic differentiation of Purkinje cells. In this review we will focus on the role of PKC in activity-driven plastic changes during dendritic differentiation, LTD and multiple climbing fiber elimination and we will discuss the involvement of specific PKC isoforms in these processes. We will put forward the hypothesis that PKC plays a central role and may be a common intracellular pathway for mediating plastic changes in all three paradigms occurring at Purkinje cell dendrites.

## The role of granule cells for Purkinje cell dendritic development

It has been known for a long time that dendritic morphology depends on afferent innervation and activity. For Purkinje cells this was shown in experiments, in which granule cells were killed in neonatal rats by X-irradiation.⁵⁶ This treatment eliminated more than 90% of the normal afferent innervation of Purkinje cells. As a consequence, Purkinje cell dendritic arbours were no longer oriented towards the pial border but extended randomly. The size of the dendritic arbours was substantially reduced, and higher order dendritic branches were absent.⁷ Nevertheless, Purkinje cells developed a substantial dendritic arbour even in the absence of granule cell innervation. These findings were similar to observations made in mice carrying the *weaver* mutation, in which granule cells die before formation of contacts with Purkinje cells.⁸ Although Purkinje cells from *weaver*

mice were missing higher order dendritic branches covered with spines (spiny branchlets) they did form many dendritic spines on first and second order branches that were not covered by afferent synapses. These studies demonstrated that the development of the classical, highly branched arbour with spiny branchlets oriented in a strict sagittal plane requires parallel fiber input, indicating the importance of afferent innervation for dendritic tree development. On the other hand, they also showed that even in the absence of most afferent inputs a substantial dendritic tree with postsynaptic specializations like dendritic spines develops, indicating the presence of important intrinsic determinants of dendritic arbour development.

The role of granule cells for Purkinje cell development has also been studied in culture models, in particular in dissociated Purkinje cell cultures and organotypic slice cultures. Culture models show important and considerable differences to the *in vivo* situation and there are important differences between slice cultures and dissociated cultures. Nevertheless, they are useful to study specific aspects of the role of granule cells for Purkinje cell development. In dissociated cultures, granule cells were shown to be necessary for Purkinje cell survival and dendritic differentiation.⁹ In organotypic slice cultures¹⁰ there is a more complex situation. It is possible to induce a reduction of granule cells and parallel fiber innervation of Purkinje cells by treating these cultures with mitotic inhibitors.¹¹ In such cultures there is a strong increase in Purkinje cell axon recurrent collaterals that partially compensate for the loss of parallel fibers¹² and Purkinje cell survival in such cultures is increased.¹³ Despite the reorganization of axonal innervation the overall morphology of the Purkinje cell dendritic tree in granuloprival cultures remains very similar to that in control cultures (JP Kapfhammer, unpublished observations). In fact, the morphology of Purkinje cells grown in slice cultures (in the presence of granule cells) is somewhat similar to that of Purkinje cells from X-irradiated rats (Figure 1) indicating that the Purkinje cell dendritic tree in slice cultures may develop mostly independent of granule cell activity. These findings confirm that there is a significant intrinsic component in the regulation of Purkinje cell dendritic tree development.

One interesting aspect of the parallel fiber–Purkinje cell interaction is that granule cells do not always promote Purkinje cell survival and differentiation, as indicated by the increased Purkinje cell survival in granuloprival slice cultures. In cultured dissociated Purkinje cells some neurotrophins enhanced Purkinje cell survival in pure Purkinje cell cultures, but reduced survival in the presence of granule cells.¹⁴ These effects are probably due to increased granule cell activity resulting in glutamate excitotoxicity, because inhibitors of AMPA receptors can block it. A complex regulatory effect of granule cell activation on Purkinje cell survival and dendritic development is also evident in *lurcher* mutant mice which carry a mutation of the glutamate receptor δ2 (GluRδ2)

resulting in a large constitutive inward current in Purkinje cells.¹⁵ This mutation is functionally similar to a strong continuous afferent stimulation by granule cells. In *lurcher* mice increased Purkinje cell death occurs between P7 and P28, and the dendritic trees of surviving Purkinje cells are greatly reduced in size. When granule cells in these mutants are reduced by X-irradiation the number of Purkinje cells recovers and the dendritic arbours of the cells are increased in size and complexity. In these mutants, destruction of granule cells by X-irradiation that by itself (as discussed above) reduces dendritic development of Purkinje cells now has a paradoxical effect and promotes dendritic development. The growth promoting effects of granule cells for Purkinje cell dendrites can thus be limited by a strong activation with increased glutamate release leading to excitotoxic death of Purkinje cells and a reduction of the size of their dendritic arbours.

### Neuronal activity, PKC and Purkinje cell dendritic development

One of the most important aspects of the loss of afferent innervation is the reduction of electrical stimulation of the developing dendritic tree. A number of more recent studies have specifically addressed the role of synaptic activity and activation of glutamate receptors for Purkinje cell dendritic development. Blockade of action potentials in cultured Purkinje cells by tetrodotoxin (TTX) or by high Mg²⁺ strongly affected the morphology of dissociated Purkinje cells.¹⁶ In the absence of action potentials these cells grew a few long dendrites which showed only little further branching. This indicates that action potential stimulation is a strong stimulus for dendritic branching for Purkinje cells grown in culture, but that it may also confer a stop signal for dendritic elongation. When organotypic slice cultures were exposed to TTX for prolonged time there was a reduction of inhibitory synapses onto Purkinje cell dendrites, but no loss of excitatory axospinous synapses.¹⁷ Although no analysis of the branching pattern of Purkinje cell dendrites was undertaken in this study the results suggest that there was no major reorganization of the dendritic morphology. In a recent study using organotypic slice cultures no effect of TTX treatment on size and branching of Purkinje cell dendritic arbours was found.¹⁸

There are only few studies examining the effect of neurotransmitters on Purkinje cell dendritic morphology. In chick embryos, development of Purkinje cell dendritic arbours was analysed after chronic treatment with an NMDA receptor antagonist *in ovo*.¹⁹ Although it was not clear whether a complete NMDA receptor blockade was achieved in these experiments, there was a reduction in the average size of the dendritic tree by about 20% in the treated embryos, but only a minor reduction of the number of branching points. These results suggest that dendritic growth is stimulated by synaptic activity. In a

(B) The dendritic morphology of a Purkinje cell from a rat cerebellar slice culture with granule cells grown for two weeks *in vitro*. The overall similarity to the cell shown in A indicates that granule cells do not play a major role for the basal dendritic development of Purkinje cells in slice cultures.

more recent study the effects of glutamate receptor blockers and activators were studied in dissociated cocultures of Purkinje cells with granule cells.²⁰ Blockade of NMDA receptors resulted in a reduction of Purkinje cell dendritic growth, similar to that observed by Vogel and Prittie,¹⁹ whereas NMDA receptor stimulation enhanced dendritic growth. Further analysis showed that these effects were not due to stimulation of NMDA receptors expressed in Purkinje cells, but rather mediated through increased release of BDNF by granule cells after NMDA receptor stimulation.

In addition to the effects of bioelectrical activity and neurotransmitter activation there are striking morphological changes of Purkinje cell dendrites after modulation of the activity of the intracellular signalling molecule PKC. Activation of PKC by a phorbol ester in organotypic slice cultures resulted in stunted dendritic growth yielding a very small dendritic tree with short primary dendrites and very few side branches¹⁸ (Figure 2). Interestingly, these changes were also seen when the activation of PKC is only started after 6 days *in vitro* (DIV), a time point when already a sizeable dendritic tree has developed. This indicates that existing dendritic branches must have been retracted. In contrast, when the pharmacological treatment was stopped after 6 DIV and the cultures maintained under control conditions for another 6 DIV the size of the dendritic tree recovered and reached 65% of the control value, indicating the reversibility of the PKC-mediated changes. On the other hand, inhibition of Ca²⁺-dependent PKC isoforms induced dendrite branching without a major effect on the overall size of the dendritic arbour (Figure 2). Further analysis of the different PKC subtypes indicated that the PKCγ isoform is involved in these changes.²¹ Purkinje cells in slice cultures derived from PKCγ-deficient mice grew a somewhat larger dendritic tree with increased branching, indicating that activation of PKCγ may be indeed a limiting factor for Purkinje cell dendritic growth. In addition, treatment of slice cultures from PKCγ-deficient mice with PKC inhibitors had no longer a branching-promoting effect on Purkinje cell dendrites.²¹ Although these findings confirm a role for PKCγ in the control of Purkinje cell dendritic growth, it is evident that it cannot be the only PKC isoform involved because PKC activation in slice cultures from PKCγ-deficient mice still induced a strong reduction of Purkinje cell dendritic tree size and branching.

### Expression of PKC isoforms in the cerebellar cortex

The PKC family can be classified into three groups of isozymes based on their structural and enzymatic properties. The classical Ca²⁺-dependent PKC isoforms (α, βI, βII and γ) require phosphatidylserine or diacylglycerol (DAG) for activation. Novel PKC isoforms (δ, ε, η and θ) are Ca²⁺-independent and are activated by DAG alone.²²⁻²⁵ Atypical PKC isoforms (ζ and λ/ι) are insensitive to Ca²⁺ and DAG.²⁶ In the cerebellum of various species, the presence of several PKC isoforms has been described (α, βI, βII, γ, δ, ε and ζ). Some of them show unique expression patterns suggesting functional specifications of these isoforms associated to certain cell types. Due to the high degree of overlap in protein sequences of several PKC isoforms some of the commercially available antibodies directed towards a specific isoform indeed show cross-reactivity with other isoforms. This has led to some inconsistencies and contradictions in published reports on the regional distribution of specific isoforms.

In contrast, inhibition of PKC isoforms induces extensive branching without a major effect on the size of the dendritic tree (right).

and the results based on antibody stainings need to be treated with caution. Nevertheless, some clear expression patterns emerge which are supported by evidence from different studies. PKCα is an isoform expressed in seemingly every cell at moderate level, i.e. it has been detected in granule cells, Purkinje cells and other cerebellar cell types^{27–30} (Figure 3). The PKCβI and βII isoforms, two splice variants of the same gene, are expressed exclusively in granule cells with fully separated subcellular localizations.^{27,28,31,32} Whereas PKCβI is found predominantly in the granular cell body and the small dendrites, the PKCβII isoform is directed predominantly to parallel fibers and presynaptic endings^{33} (Figure 3).

caudal differences in its location pattern.³²,³⁷⁻⁴³ PKCγ and δ thereby seem to be differentially distributed and regulated within the Purkinje cells.³⁶,⁴³ PKCε mRNA was found in rat cerebellar granule cells⁴⁴ indicating its presence in granule cells. However, the protein seems to be targeted to parallel fibers since a specific antibody exclusively stained the molecular layer.⁴³ Finally, the presence of the atypical PKCζ isoform has also been reported to be at low level occurring preferentially in Purkinje cell bodies and nuclei.²⁸,⁴⁵,⁴⁶ All other PKC isoforms are either absent from or only expressed at undetectable levels in the cerebellum.

The developmental regulation of protein expression in the cerebellum has been described for PKCα, β, γ and δ. Thereby, both PKCα and β are present in granule cells and their precursors in the external layer.³³ Their increasing protein levels reach a stable state after three weeks of postnatal age. At any stage of development, PKCα but not PKCβ is also expressed in cell bodies of Purkinje cells.³³ PKCγ is detected in cell bodies and dendrites of Purkinje cells already at birth although in low levels, which then increase over the first two weeks and reaching a peak of expression during the third week.³³,³⁴,⁴⁷ In contrast to the graduated upregulation of the Ca²⁺-dependent PKC isoforms associated to the increasing synaptic connectivity and communication between the cerebellar neurons, PKCδ expression undergoes a dramatic cellular redistribution during postnatal development. At birth, only glial cells express PKCδ, whereas after three weeks of postnatal age nearly all Purkinje cells and stellate/basket cells express this enzyme.³⁸ Thus, the developmental expression of Ca²⁺-dependent PKC isoforms obviously coincides with increasing functional integration of the cerebellar circuits and supports their specific involvement in activity-dependent regulatory mechanisms whereas the Ca²⁺-independent PKCδ seems to be involved in different signalling pathways.

### The role of PKC in climbing fiber elimination

Proximal Purkinje cell dendrites undergo a dynamic modification of innervation by climbing fibers originating from the inferior olive of the medulla during postnatal rodent development⁴⁸. Early postnatally in the rat, each Purkinje cell is innervated by several climbing fibers.² Subsequent elimination of supernumerary fibers until three weeks of age yields a one-to-one relation between climbing fibers and Purkinje cells that is then maintained throughout lifetime.²,⁴⁹,⁵⁰ Increasing excitatory parallel fiber inputs during this postnatal period regulate this process. Activation of GluRδ2 thereby limits climbing fiber innervation to the proximal dendrites⁵¹,⁵² as well as regulating maturation of parallel fiber-Purkinje cell synapses.⁵³ On the other hand, the signalling cascade of metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (mGluR1) with subsequent induction of the Gαq protein, phospholipase Cβ4 and Ca²⁺-dependent activation of PKC is the executing pathway of climbing fiber elimination. This could be proven by the use of mutant mice for the respective molecules or transgenic models which all displayed impaired climbing fiber regression until 5 weeks of age.⁵²,⁵⁴⁻⁵⁹ Since the signal transduction from mGluR1 activation is converged down to PKCγ this enzyme seems to be the final converging part of this cascade and is supposed to be a crucial player in the morphological maturation of Purkinje cells and climbing fiber inputs. However, most of the studies were done in young adult animals and a recent study showed that climbing fiber innervation in older (three to six months) mice transgenic for a pseudosubstrate PKC inhibitor (peptide 19–31) directed against all PKC isoforms is normal.⁶⁰ One way to explain this discrepancy is to presume an only incomplete blockade of the PKC isoforms by this PKC inhibitor peptide. Support for this idea comes from a recent study where Purkinje cell survival in slice cultures from postnatal day 3 was only partially improved by transgenic expression of the PKC inhibitor peptide compared to pharmacological PKC inhibition with Gö6976 which rescued much more Purkinje cells.⁶¹ Alternatively, blocking this signalling pathway may delay rather than abolish the process of climbing fiber elimination during cerebellar development suggesting PKC being a modulatory compound of a different signalling cascade. It remains to be resolved if this recovery from abnormal climbing fiber innervation during lifetime also appears in the other mutant mice of the mGluR1 pathway.

### The role of PKC in LTD

The long-term depression of synaptic transmission at Purkinje cell synapses (LTD) emerges during simultaneous activation of climbing and parallel fibers and is seen as an important functional basis of motor learning.⁴⁸,⁶²⁻⁶⁴ LTD is expressed entirely postsynaptically on Purkinje cells⁶³,⁶⁵,⁶⁶ and can occur at parallel fiber as well as climbing fiber synapses.⁶³,⁶⁷ Signalling through GluRδ2 and the mGluR1 pathway play a central role in its execution.⁵¹,⁵⁹ In both cases, Ca²⁺-activated PKC phosphorylates AMPA receptors inducing a subsequent destabilization and internalization of the receptor clusters⁶³,⁶⁵,⁶⁸,⁶⁹, which is the main mechanism underlying the depression of synaptic activity. Despite the obvious mechanistic similarities of LTD and climbing fiber elimination and the unique protein expression pattern of PKCγ exclusively in Purkinje cells this enzyme unexpectedly seems to be not required for LTD. The PKCγ-deficient mouse displayed normal LTD,⁷⁰ which was interpreted by compensatory upregulation of other isoforms. Support for this hypothesis came from a recent study showing a slight upregulation of PKCα in cerebella from adult PKCγ-deficient mice.²¹ Nevertheless, the PKC family members are crucial downstream effectors

Proposed model of activity-dependent PKC signalling in Purkinje cells. The Ca²⁺-dependent PKC (cPKC) isoforms expressed in Purkinje cells (PKCα and PKCγ) play a central role in activity-dependent pathways regulating functional changes in the minutes-to-hours range (LTD) as well as morphological changes in a days-to-weeks range (climbing fiber elimination and dendritic differentiation). Thereby, the glutamate-activated mGluR1 signalling cascade induces cPKC's by the delivery of DAG via PIP₂ cleavage through PLCβ4 and subsequent Ca²⁺ release from the ER. mGluR1, metabotropic glutamate receptor 1; PIP₂, phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate; Gαq, G-protein subunit αq; PLCβ4, phospholipase β4; IP₃, inositol triphosphate; IP₃R, inositol triphosphate receptor; DAG, diacylglycerol; cPKC, classical PKC isoforms; ER, endoplasmic reticulum.

for LTD execution as confirmed by the use of the pseudosubstrate PKC inhibitor peptide transgenically expressed in Purkinje cells.⁵⁸,⁶⁰,⁷¹ Very recently, another hypothesis was raised assigning different functions to different PKC subtypes, i.e. LTD induction to PKCα and regulation of motoric function to PKCγ.³⁰ The authors observed translocation to the membrane upon LTD induction of PKCα but not PKCγ. This might be an indication for a divergence of the mGluR1 pathway at this level into short-term and long-term modulatory pathways of cellular plasticity, an idea supported by the lack of LTD alteration in the PKCγ-deficient mouse. Further support for this hypothesis should be gained from experiments investigating mice deficient in PKCα, where expression of LTD should be strongly reduced or absent if no compensatory effects occur. On the other hand, it will be interesting to investigate the climbing fiber elimination in PKCα-deficient mice, which should be normal in these mice. Parallel fiber-Purkinje cell synapses have also been reported to express a presynaptic cAMP-dependent form of long-term potentiation (LTP) which is independent of Purkinje cell activity.⁷²⁻⁷⁵ Very recently, a delayed postsynaptic LTP requiring NO signaling⁷⁶ was described. However, both forms of plasticity are independent of Ca²⁺ changes and PKC signalling in Purkinje cells. With respect to the novel PKC family members nothing is currently known about their involvement in cerebellar plasticity although PKCδ is expressed at high levels in Purkinje cells (see above). Since PKCδ is fully Ca²⁺-independent and its subcellular distribution in Purkinje cells largely differs from PKCγ³⁶ PKCδ might act as a downstream effector in this pathway or be involved in other cellular functions. However, PKCδ seems to be subcellularly redistributed in Purkinje

cells after unilateral labyrinthectomy indicating a link of PKCδ function to activity-dependent pathways.⁴³ Taken together, the mGluR1 signalling cascade in Purkinje cells seems to be a central pathway in Purkinje cell LTD induction and morphological plasticity. On the level of PKC activation, a decision into short-term and long-term changes (PKCα versus PKCγ) seems to be made which then enter different downstream cascades (Figure 4).

### PKC signalling pathways and the regulation of dendritic growth

In the last years, research on the intracellular mechanisms regulating dendritic growth and arborization has been very productive and a number of important intracellular regulators of dendritic growth have been identified. Many (although not all) signals regulating axonal growth also modulate the growth of dendrites⁷⁷–⁷⁹ including receptor phosphorylation, gene transcription, Notch and Rho family GTPase signalling and cytoskeletal rearrangements, all processes necessary for morphological changes. Importantly, many of these signals are modulated by synaptic activity, supporting the hypothesis that the structure of dendrites can be rapidly modified by synaptic plasticity. In several nervous tissues, Ca²⁺/Calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is known as an important factor regulating synaptic and dendritic plasticity and was shown to be involved in many of the relevant processes.⁸⁰,⁸¹ Furthermore, it is one component suggested to be induced by activation of dendritic mRNA translation during plastic changes.⁸²,⁸³ It is well conceivable that many of these pathways also interact with PKC signalling. Upon activation, PKC phosphorylates a number of intracellular and membrane-associated proteins including GAP-43, MARCKS and CAP-23, proteins associated with neuronal plasticity.⁸⁴ Similarly adducin, a cytoskeletal component expressed in dendritic spines, has been shown to be an *in vivo* PKC target possibly involved in plasticity.⁸⁵ These findings support the concept that PKC activity is an important part of the signalling pathways for activity-driven changes of synaptic function and dendritic morphology.

### Conclusions

In this review we have discussed evidence showing that the dendritic development of cerebellar Purkinje cells is a highly regulated process. Within the first postnatal week in the rodent Purkinje cells grow out a basic dendritic tree seemingly independent of afferent regulatory mechanisms by cell-intrinsic differentiation programs. When the parallel fibers arrive at the Purkinje cell dendrites during the second postnatal week, the further fine-tuning of these connections is governed by activity-dependent mechanisms. Afferent inputs as well as cell-intrinsic signalling pathways then act in concert to regulate the execution of functional and morphological plasticity. Crucial components of the underlying signalling pathways in the Purkinje cell seem to be elevation of intracellular Ca²⁺ and the subsequent activation of Ca²⁺-dependent PKC isoforms (see Figure 4). Interestingly, these PKC isoforms thereby trigger both short-term functional changes during LTD as well as long-term processes in developing Purkinje cells such as climbing fiber elimination and dendritic differentiation (Figure 4). Thus, the same signalling pathways involving activation of Ca²⁺-dependent PKC isoforms obviously are used on different temporal levels which strongly suggests a link between the functional mechanisms regulating short-term and long-term plastic changes in Purkinje cells.
