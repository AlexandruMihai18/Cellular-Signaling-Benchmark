## Alcoholic liver disease: mechanisms of injury and targeted treatment

### Alexandre Louvet and Philippe Mathurin

#### Abstract
Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is a complex process that includes a wide spectrum of hepatic lesions, from steatosis to cirrhosis. Cell injury, inflammation, oxidative stress, regeneration and bacterial translocation are key drivers of alcohol-induced liver injury. Alcoholic hepatitis is the most severe form of all the alcohol-induced liver lesions. Animal models of ALD mainly involve mild liver damage (that is, steatosis and moderate inflammation), whereas severe alcoholic hepatitis in humans occurs in the setting of cirrhosis and is associated with severe liver failure. For this reason, translational studies using humans and human samples are crucial for the development of new therapeutic strategies. Although multiple attempts have been made to improve patient outcome, the treatment of alcoholic hepatitis is still based on abstinence from alcohol and brief exposure to corticosteroids. However, nearly 40% of patients with the most severe forms of alcoholic hepatitis will not benefit from treatment. We suggest that future clinical trials need to focus on end points other than mortality. This Review discusses the main pathways associated with the progression of liver disease, as well as potential therapeutic strategies targeting these pathways.

### Introduction
Excess alcohol consumption is the primary cause of liver-related mortality in Western countries. The consequences of alcohol consumption on health vary according to the drinking pattern (excessive or not, acute or chronic); environmental and individual factors are also key drivers.¹ Alcohol-induced liver injury includes fatty liver, fibrosis and alcoholic hepatitis; these basic lesions can occur separately, simultaneously or sequentially in the same patient. Alcoholic hepatitis is a necroinflammatory process that is associated with the fastest progression of fibrosis and leads to cirrhosis in 40% of cases.²⁻⁴ This pivotal lesion markedly increases the risk of liver decompensation, whereas patients without alcoholic hepatitis are at lower risk of developing cirrhosis.⁴ These discrepancies in the natural progression of the disease explain why a subgroup of heavy drinkers with inflammatory features are candidates for treatment to reduce short-term and intermediate-term liver injury, whereas patients without these lesions are candidates for treatment to reduce long-term morbidity and mortality. Thus, in patients with inflammatory features, new drugs should target specific pathways to restore liver function, whilst patients with milder liver disease (for example, isolated steatosis) could benefit from other therapeutic strategies to maintain abstinence and limit the progression of fibrosis.

Survival (>5 years) is better in patients with cirrhosis who remain abstinent than in those who begin drinking again.⁵⁶ However, unlike outcomes after treatment for other liver diseases such as chronic HBV, HCV or autoimmune hepatitis, no evidence exists for the reversal of cirrhosis in alcoholic liver disease (ALD). Early lesions such as steatosis might disappear after alcohol withdrawal in heavy drinkers who do not have other risk factors for steatosis (such as insulin resistance and/or obesity),⁷ whereas the inflammatory lesions of alcoholic hepatitis can persist for several months after alcohol withdrawal.⁸⁹ It is important to bear in mind that ALD is often diagnosed at very advanced stages of the disease, unlike other types of liver disease such as HCV or NAFLD. This fact emphasizes the need for systematic screening of fibrosis in heavy drinkers, using noninvasive methods such as transient elastography or blood tests.¹ A large study to assess the effect of this type of screening programme is needed. This Review discusses the relevance of certain pathways according to the type of liver lesion, and of potential molecules targeting these pathways in relation to the pattern and the severity of liver injury.

### Ethanol metabolism and cell injury
Ethanol is a small molecule that diffuses easily across cell membranes. Many factors influence ethanol absorption and metabolism, including gender, age, ethnicity and body weight, and <10% of ethanol is directly eliminated by the lungs, kidneys and sweat in its unchanged form.¹⁰ The main metabolic pathway involved in the biotransformation of ethanol is oxidation into acetaldehyde (Figure 1). This process uses NAD⁺ and is primarily achieved by

Key points

- Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is characterized by a complex spectrum of histological lesions, ranging from steatosis to cirrhosis
- Alcoholic hepatitis is a specific entity, which is associated with a fast progression to cirrhosis and with liver failure and a poor outcome in its most severe form
- ALD is characterized by oxidative stress, disturbance of hepatocyte metabolism, liver inflammation, modifications in the regeneration process and translocation of bacterial products from the gut microbiota into the portal blood stream
- Because animal models do not reproduce the complete spectrum of alcohol-induced hepatic lesions, translational research based on human samples is crucial to identify new treatment options
- The best-documented treatment for severe alcoholic hepatitis is corticosteroids, but this treatment is not ideal and 40% of patients still die after a short period of time
- The future evaluation of new strategies in severe alcoholic hepatitis should focus not only upon survival, but also on surrogate markers of outcome, with a specific plan of development


Figure 1 | Metabolism of ethanol and related cell injury. Ethanol is mainly metabolized by alcohol dehydrogenase and MEOS into acetaldehyde, which is responsible for the generation of ROS. ROS cause oxidative stress, ER stress and steatosis. ROS are also generated through activation of NADPH oxidase in Kupffer cells. All these changes in hepatocyte metabolism lead to inflammation and apoptosis.

Figure 2 | Mechanisms of alcohol-related steatosis. Chronic alcohol consumption leads to steatosis via generation of acetaldehyde, ROS and ER stress. The consequences are blockade of PPARα and of AMPK, which is responsible for fatty acid oxidation and export via ACC and CPT-1. In addition, chronic alcohol consumption induces SREBP1c activation, which is responsible for fatty acid synthesis through FAS and fatty acid desaturation through SCD1. TNF also leads to steatosis by activating SREBP1c. Betaine reduces homocysteine levels, which thus enhances ER stress. Chronic alcohol consumption also induces adipose tissue inflammation, which decreases the release of the protective adiponectin, thus favouring steatosis. All these mechanisms lead to disruption of hepatic lipid metabolism by increasing lipogenesis and decreasing fatty acid oxidation and export.

CHOP-GADD153 pathway.³¹,³² IRF3 links endoplasmic reticulum stress to mitochondria and subsequent hepatocyte apoptosis by activation of caspases, but also to liver inflammation in hepatocytes and liver mononuclear cells by stimulating the interferon and the NF-κB pathways.³³ Endoplasmic reticulum stress, amplified by elevated homocysteine levels, contributes to alcohol tissue damage and is counterbalanced by transcription genes involved in the unfolded protein response, such as GRP78, GRP94 or Herp.³⁴,³⁵ Another consequence of endoplasmic reticulum stress is the activation of the steatogenic pathways in hepatocytes, in particular via SREBPs (sterol regulatory element-binding proteins).³⁶,³⁷ Ethanol also generates endoplasmic reticulum stress in stellate cells through inhibition of a protective autophagy phenomenon, leading to their activation in fibrogenic cells.³⁸

Mechanisms of alcohol-induced steatosis

Chronic alcohol consumption promotes steatosis by disrupting hepatic lipid metabolism via SREBPs and PPAR-α (peroxisome proliferator-activating receptor α), which are directly influenced by AMPK (5' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase) (Figure 2). SREBP1c exerts its deleterious role by increasing fatty acid biosynthesis through fatty acid synthase and enzymes responsible for fatty acid desaturation such as stearoyl-CoA desaturase.³⁹ SREBP expression is increased by acetaldehyde and TNF,⁴⁰ which also stimulate its maturation in hepatocytes.⁴¹ SREBP might be downregulated by betaine (also known as glycine betaine) administration.³⁷ Conversely, PPAR-α prevents ethanol-induced steatosis.⁴² Its expression is reduced in hepatocytes by acetaldehyde⁴³ and during chronic alcohol intake by downregulation of

RXR-α, which prevents its heterodimerization to PPAR-α and subsequently alters PPAR-α signalling.⁴⁴

As in metabolic steatosis, AMPK downregulation is central to alcohol-induced lipid accumulation by stimulating SREBP1c and inhibiting PPAR-α expression.²⁴⁵,⁴⁶ AMPK expression is decreased by ethanol *in vitro* and in experimental models of alcoholic steatosis.⁴⁷,⁴⁸ AMPK downregulation also causes a decrease in fatty acid oxidation mediated by acetyl-coA carboxylase and carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1. Lipid metabolism disturbances are also worsened by endoplasmic reticulum stress and ROS. The metabolic pathways sirtuin-1,⁴⁹,⁵⁰ cannabinoid receptors,⁵¹,⁵² complement fractions⁵³⁻⁵⁵ and PPAR-γ⁵⁶ might also participate in alcohol-induced steatosis. All of these mechanisms increase lipogenesis and decrease fatty acid oxidation and export during chronic alcohol consumption.

Insulin resistance has a key role in alcohol-induced steatosis, as shown by the faster disease progression in patients who are overweight and drink to excess compared with normal weight individuals who drink to excess.⁵⁷⁻⁵⁹ However, data also suggest that modest alcohol intake might result in a decrease in inflammatory lesions in patients with NAFLD.⁶⁰ In animal models, ethanol feeding induces insulin resistance, macrophage infiltration and the production of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF, IL-6 and CC-chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2, also known as MCP-1) in adipose tissue.⁶¹ Adiponectin is downregulated in those models,⁶¹ leading to a decrease in fatty acid oxidation, an increase in fatty acid synthesis and inhibition of AMPK and PPAR-α.⁶²⁻⁶⁴ Decreased production of adiponectin has also been observed in adipose tissue due to endoplasmic reticulum stress through an accumulation of homocysteine in adipocytes.⁶⁵

### Immunity, dysbiosis and ALD

The role of bacterial translocation in the pathogenesis of ALD has been clearly established. Chronic alcohol exposure in humans and animal models increases circulating concentrations of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) compared with controls,⁶⁶⁻⁶⁸ and the severity of hepatic injury is correlated to serum levels of LPS.⁶⁹,⁷⁰ Exogenous administration of LPS induces necroinflammatory lesions in the liver,⁶⁶,⁷¹ whereas administration of antibiotics or probiotics reduces the severity of hepatic lesions in ethanol-fed rats.⁷²,⁷³ After translocation from the gut lumen to the liver, LPS and other pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) are recognized by pathogen-recognition receptors (PRRs), including TLRs (Toll-like receptors, mainly TLR4, which is responsible for LPS recognition) and NOD1 and NOD2 (nucleotide oligomerization domain) receptors. As well as LPS–TLR4, liver inflammation is also mediated by other bacterial compounds, which explains why the injection of other bacterial motifs also leads to recruitment of inflammatory cells.⁷⁴ More specifically, the activation of TLR2 and TLR6 (which are both responsible for recognition of bacterial lipopeptides), and TLR9 (which recognizes bacterial DNA-containing unmethylated CpG motifs), leads to an increase in the proinflammatory cascade in ALD.⁷⁴,⁷⁵

After binding to TLR4 via LBP (lipopolysaccharide binding protein), LPS activates Kupffer cells via a signalling cascade that includes CD14, MyD88, MD-2 (also known as lymphocyte antigen 96) and finally results in the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (such as ERK1, ERK2, JNK and p38), NF-κB⁷⁶ and AP-1.⁷⁷ This activation might also be MyD88-independent.⁷⁸ When these pathways are activated, Kupffer cells release ROS, adhesion molecules (such as ICAM-1 [intracellular adhesion molecule 1] and VCAM-1 [vascular cell adhesion protein 1]), chemokines (IL-8 and CCL2) and proinflammatory cytokines (TNF, IL-1 and IL-6).²,⁷⁹ Targeting NADPH oxidase in Kupffer cells might be an interesting therapeutic target because of its role in the defence against bacteria, in inflammatory responses, generation of ROS and in the control of hepatic fibrosis.¹⁶,⁸⁰,⁸¹ Finally, the intracellular labile iron fraction regulates activation of NF-κB in Kupffer cells⁸² and the cascade of inflammation pathways associated with the early stages of alcohol-induced liver injury.⁸³⁻⁸⁵

Leukocyte recruitment amplifies the inflammatory response to LPS. In humans, alcoholic hepatitis is characterized by the presence of large amounts of cytokines that are highly sensitive to PAMPs, such as RANTES (also known as C-C chemokine receptor type 1), IL-8, Gro-α and CCL2,⁸⁶⁻⁸⁹ leading to neutrophil recruitment in the liver. Besides their role in neutrophil infiltration, proinflammatory changes in Kupffer cells also seem to enhance steatosis.⁹⁰,⁹¹ The role of Kupffer cells is not just deleterious in ALD—these cells can also adopt an anti-inflammatory phenotype⁹² and release IL-10.⁹³

Although innate immunity has a central role in the pathogenesis of ALD, adaptive immunity might also contribute to the progression of alcohol-induced liver injury. Indeed, chronic alcohol consumption leads to the development of antibodies directed against lipid peroxidation products, which activate an adaptive immune response.² More specifically, alcohol consumption stimulates splenic T cells and natural killer T (NKT) cells in the liver, leading to the development of a cytotoxic response against hepatocytes, which might be related, at least in part, to Fas and TNF receptor 1 signalling.⁹⁴,⁹⁵ Other cells, such as stellate cells, might also participate in the release of inflammatory mediators, such as CCL2, IL-8, TNF and IL-1.⁹⁶⁻⁹⁸

When considering the effects of bacterial translocation on the pathogenesis of ALD, the question of modifications in gut microbiota (that is, dysbiosis) in patients with excess alcohol consumption has become an important issue. Bacterial overgrowth⁹⁹ and dysbiosis have been observed in animal models¹⁰⁰ with subsequent intestinal oxidative stress, leaky gut and intestinal inflammation.¹⁰¹,¹⁰² In dysbiosis, ethanol targets gut microbes by decreasing their ability to synthesize saturated fatty acids; by contrast, supplementation of saturated long-chain fatty acids restores eubiosis, reduces gut leakiness and ALD.¹⁰³ Compared with nondrinkers, some patients who drink to excess have been shown to have colonic dysbiosis, including a lower percentage of *Bacteroidetes* and a higher percentage of *Proteobacteria*, which are associated with higher levels of endotoxins. This finding suggests that PAMP-induced liver inflammation might be enhanced in these
individuals.^[104]^ Quantitative metagenomics has also shown that patients with cirrhosis can be identified according to clusters of cognate bacterial species compared with healthy individuals,^[105]^ suggesting that gut microorganisms have a role in the severity of liver disease. Thus, probiotics might be able to help limit the progression of ALD. Indeed, preliminary studies have shown that the administration of probiotics (for example, *Lactobacillus sp.*) restored gut microbiota, reduced hepatic inflammation in animals,^[106]^ restored the phagocytic capacities of neutrophils in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis^[107]^ and improved liver enzyme levels in heavy drinkers.^[108]^ Prebiotics have also been shown to be protective in NAFLD^[109]^ and can be viewed as a promising strategy in ALD, although no data support their use at present.^[110]^

### Regeneration and ALD

Liver regeneration is a key target for the development of new treatment molecules in ALD, in particular alcoholic hepatitis. Regeneration is necessary to restore functional liver tissue after insults such as partial hepatectomy or toxic injury. Hepatocytes proliferate in the absence of chronic liver disease, but in ALD this mechanism is not as effective when liver progenitor cells might act as facultative cells for regeneration (discussed later).^[111,112]^ Models of partial hepatectomy have identified TNF, IL-6, STAT-3 and NF-κB as the key drivers of liver regeneration.^[113–117]^ In alcohol-fed mice, steatosis is associated with increased production of ROS and inhibition of mature hepatocyte proliferation.^[118]^ Chronic ethanol exposure also impairs liver regeneration by limiting DNA synthesis by mature hepatocytes^[119]^ and impairing normal miRNA signalling during the regeneration process.^[120]^ At a cellular level, chronic alcohol consumption induces senescent replication of hepatocytes and proliferation of liver progenitors.^[111]^ An important missing piece of the research puzzle is the lack of an experimental model with altered liver regeneration.

Although data are lacking on the effect of the accumulation of liver progenitor cells in alcohol-injured livers, an incomplete differentiation process leading to repopulation of the liver parenchyma by ductular cells instead of mature hepatocytes could explain why some patients with severe forms of alcoholic hepatitis fail to recover.^[121,122]^ Our group has shown that patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis who do not respond to medical treatment have low hepatic expression of TNF and IL-6 and an aberrant regeneration process in which hepatic progenitor cells cannot differentiate into mature hepatocytes.^[123]^ Thus, new therapeutic strategies should target hepatocyte survival and replication or liver progenitor cell differentiation into mature hepatocytes.

### Disease models of ALD

A major unmet need in the study of ALD is the lack of a reliable animal model that mimics the entire spectrum of this disease in humans. Indeed, owing to marked differences in alcohol metabolism between rodents and humans, most animal models with simple ethanol feeding lead to steatosis, mild liver inflammation and no fibrosis, with major differences between mouse strains in terms of liver injury.^[124]^ An ideal animal model of alcoholic hepatitis should at least include inflammation, steatosis, cell damage, fibrosis and the activation of regeneration. The first model of chronic alcohol exposure was developed in rats^[125]^ and induced the development of isolated steatosis. This model was modified so that larger quantities of ethanol could be administered for 4–12 weeks (the so-called Lieber-De Carli model^[126]^). Later, a model based on chronic intragastric infusion of ethanol was developed that resulted in mild inflammation and fibrosis.^[127,128]^ To mimic the inflammation observed in humans, some researchers have suggested injecting bacterial compounds in chronically fed rodents at the end of the ethanol diet.^[74,119,129]^ For the moment, animal models with severe inflammatory lesions exist (although these models must be confirmed by others; for example, the chronic plus binge drinking model^[130]^ and the modified Tsukamoto–French model^[131]^), but there is still no model with cirrhosis and bilirubinostasis.

As data from rodents can only barely be extrapolated to humans, data from human samples are the best way to further the understanding of the pathogenesis and treatment of ALD. For example, transcriptome analysis based on human samples has identified the TNF superfamily receptors as a potential area of development of therapeutic strategies, because their expression is upregulated in the liver of patients with alcoholic hepatitis compared with healthy controls or patients with other liver diseases.^[132]^ On the basis of these examples, outcomes can now be linked to the histological^[133]^ and/or molecular signatures of patients with alcoholic hepatitis.^[87,122,134–136]^ Another approach that has been taken with other liver diseases—that is, confirming data from human samples in animal models—could help identify new therapeutic pathways.^[137]^ Because translational research based on human samples has such a key role in the understanding of mechanisms of alcoholic hepatitis, the collection of biospecimens in future clinical trials could help substantially in the design of new therapeutic strategies.

### Targeted treatment of ALD

#### Corticosteroids

Corticosteroids were proposed in the AASLD (American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases)^[138]^ and EASL (European Association for the Study of the Liver)^[1]^ guidelines to treat severe forms of alcoholic hepatitis (defined by a Maddrey’s discriminant function ≥32) on the basis of meta-analyses showing a reduction in short-term mortality.^[139,140]^ Nevertheless, despite the positive effects of this treatment on short-term survival, mortality 6 months after the onset of disease is still ~30–40%.^[1,3]^

Because some patients do not respond to existing corticosteroids, it is crucial to identify nonresponders rapidly. Scoring systems for alcoholic hepatitis include the Glasgow Alcoholic Hepatitis Score,^[141]^ the ABIC (age–bilirubin–INR–creatinine) score^[142]^ and the Lille model.^[143]^ The formula of the Lille model^[144]^ includes the effect of corticosteroids on bilirubin levels after 7 days of treatment, which is highly predictive of outcome.^[145]^ The difference in bilirubin level is combined with age, the presence of renal insufficiency, albumin level, prothrombin time and

bilirubin level at the beginning of treatment to generate a score that ranges from 0 to 1. The ideal cut-off of 0.45 can be used to define responders to corticosteroids (Lille score <0.45) and nonresponders (Lille score ≥0.45). The therapeutic response can be refined further by defining three populations: complete responders (Lille score ≤0.16); partial responders (Lille score 0.16–0.56); and null responders (Lille score ≥0.56). Corticosteroids can be withdrawn after 7 days in null responders, because the outcome of these patients is not different from that of patients treated with placebo.<sup>140</sup>

In theory, corticosteroids help treat severe alcoholic hepatitis because of their anti-inflammatory properties; however, the underlying pathways of this treatment have still not been clarified. In animal models, alcohol-induced liver injury was prevented by the administration of antibodies against TNF in wild-type mice and was not observed in mice lacking TNF receptor 1.<sup>146,147</sup> Because of this evidence from animal models, the first studies focused on TNF pathways. Levels of TNF<sup>89</sup> its p55 soluble receptors and IL-8 (a strong chemoattractant responsible for neutrophil recruitment) are elevated in patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis<sup>148</sup> compared with those with alcoholic cirrhosis or healthy livers. On the other hand, IL-10 levels are unaffected by the presence of alcoholic hepatitis, suggesting an imbalance between proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines. Although preliminary studies showed a correlation between baseline serum TNF levels and poor outcome, this relationship has not been confirmed in further studies.<sup>149</sup> After corticosteroid treatment, IL-8 and TNFsRp55 (soluble TNF receptor p55) plasma levels decrease, particularly TNFsRp55 in survivors, whereas IL-10 levels increase. Conversely, serum TNF levels are unchanged after corticosteroid therapy, although ex vivo experiments have shown that this treatment limits the ability of neutrophils and monocytes to produce TNF in the presence of LPS.

Patients with alcoholic hepatitis have decreased sensitivity to corticosteroids—as shown by defective inhibition of lymphocyte proliferation—and so another strategy to improve patient outcome could be to increase the effect of this treatment in this group.<sup>150</sup> Interestingly, patients who respond to corticosteroids were shown to have better ex vivo sensitivity to this drug than nonresponders.<sup>151</sup> The results of this trial were confirmed in an independent cohort<sup>152</sup> and a suggested threshold of 60% maximum intensity (of lymphocyte proliferation) was proposed to define resistance to corticosteroids. Sensitivity to corticosteroids is improved as liver dysfunction recovers and might be restored by theophylline (a xanthine), potentially via enhanced recruitment of histone deacetylases, which silence the expression of proinflammatory genes. Basiliximab (a monoclonal antibody triggering the IL-2 receptor [anti-CD25]) might be another therapeutic option to compensate for defective sensitivity to corticosteroids.<sup>151</sup> Another option to target signalling pathways involved in histone acetylation might be decreasing acetate levels via inhibition of acetyl-coA synthetase, leading to downregulation of proinflammatory genes (IL-6, IL-8 or TNF) in macrophages exposed to ethanol.<sup>153</sup> Downregulation of proinflammatory genes in macrophages and monocytes can also be obtained by stimulation of GILZ (glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipper), whose expression is stimulated by corticosteroids.<sup>154</sup> New molecules that increase sensitivity to corticosteroids could be potential targets to improve patient management.

Anti-TNF antibodies

in patients with alcoholic hepatitis were encouraging. Administration of TNF antagonists was associated with improved portal haemodynamics and liver function, reduction of plasma IL-8 and IL-6 levels and 1-month survival in >80% of patients. The first randomized study included 20 patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis, and demonstrated a greater decrease in Maddrey function in the infliximab plus prednisolone group compared to the placebo plus prednisolone group. However, the results of two large randomized controlled trials testing infliximab or etanercept (soluble TNF receptor) were disappointing, and reported higher rates of infection and mortality in the patients treated with anti-TNF agents. Major discrepancies exist in the administration protocol between the preliminary studies and the two large studies; the latter used sequential infusions whereas the first preliminary study used a single infusion of anti-TNF molecules. The sequential infusions might have increased the risk of infection. Besides the deleterious effect of anti-TNF antibodies on the risk of infection in humans, these agents might also inhibit hepatic regeneration via the blockade of TNFR1 and promote apoptosis as suggested by experimental data.

Pentoxifylline

In a randomized controlled trial in severe alcoholic hepatitis, treatment with pentoxifylline (a xanthine) improved survival compared to placebo. After publication of this initial study, two trials were published in small populations showing that pentoxifylline might be as effective or more effective than corticosteroids in such patients. Experimental data have demonstrated the anti-inflammatory effects of pentoxifylline, although its benefit in severe alcoholic hepatitis seems to be related to the prevention of hepatorenal syndrome. In the subgroup of patients not responding to corticosteroids, pentoxifylline was an ineffective rescue strategy. Although pentoxifylline and corticosteroids might have a synergistic effect as suggested by the different pattern of effects, a large randomized controlled trial did not show any benefit in survival with the combined administration of pentoxifylline and prednisolone, compared to prednisolone alone; a lower incidence of hepatorenal syndrome was noted in the combined treatment group, but did not result in improved survival compared to the prednisolone alone group. A head-to-head randomized study showed that survival was not as good with pentoxifylline as with prednisolone. In the large randomized controlled trial STOPAH, which included >1,000 patients, results with pentoxifylline were not better than placebo for short-term mortality. On the other hand, corticosteroids improved 28-day survival. One important limitation of this study was the absence of biopsy-proven alcoholic hepatitis and of previously validated noninvasive criteria for alcoholic hepatitis. As a secondary end point, 1-year survival was only affected by alcohol relapse and not by treatment allocation. In another study, pentoxifylline was not better than placebo in patients with decompensated cirrhosis, although it seemed to decrease the risk of liver decompensation. In summary, little evidence exists to support using pentoxifylline in ALD.

Other treatments

Oxidative stress is one of the key mechanisms that drives early ALD, in particular steatosis. As the precursors of glutathione have been shown to improve steatosis in rodents, it is tempting to evaluate these molecules in humans. S-adenosylmethionine could be an interesting therapeutic option for ALD because this molecule restores mitochondria levels of glutathione, whereas N-acetylcysteine does not. Betaine supplementation reduces steatosis in ethanol-fed mice by decreasing endoplasmic reticulum stress by conversion of homocysteine to methionine. However, no data yet support the use of these two molecules in humans in the early stages of ALD. Antioxidant molecules alone are not effective in severe forms of alcoholic hepatitis. Although experimental studies suggested that N-acetylcysteine was the best candidate, this drug did not improve liver injury or patient outcome in randomized studies. These molecules could be considered preventive treatment to reduce the risk of disease progression, although prospective data are needed. Conversely, the combination of N-acetylcysteine with prednisolone was associated with a greater early improvement in liver function and a lower incidence of hepatorenal syndrome than prednisolone alone, associated with a trend towards improved short-term survival. The mechanisms underlying this synergistic effect have not yet been elucidated. Further studies investigating this combination are needed.

REVIEW

Potential new treatments
Infection is a major driver of outcome in patients with decompensated cirrhosis<sup>179</sup> and severe alcoholic hepatitis.<sup>180</sup> The incidence of infection in patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis is ~25% at admission, and another 25% of patients will develop an infectious event in the 2 months after the initiation of corticosteroids.<sup>180</sup> The main mechanisms of this increased susceptibility to infections include deficiencies in complement, decreased phagocytic abilities of macrophages, neutrophil dysfunction, increased bacterial translocation and impaired activation of immunity.<sup>179,181</sup> Owing to this increased susceptibility to infections, it is tempting to evaluate the therapeutic role of antibiotics in ALD. Several studies in this field are ongoing (Table 1), including absorbable antibiotics (amoxicillin–clavulanate and quinolones) and nonabsorbable antibiotics (rifaximin). On the basis of the deleterious effect of TLR4 in severe infections and its role in the pathophysiology of ALD, TLR4 antagonists seem to be good potential candidates for testing in alcoholic cirrhosis and hepatitis.<sup>182</sup> These molecules are now available and being tested in many indications including severe infection.

New drugs should be tested on the basis of the main mechanisms involved in the type of liver injury, according to novel findings from translational research and animal models. For example, in patients with alcoholic hepatitis, an interesting potential area for investigation, the most promising options include molecules targeting inflammation such as TLR4 antagonists or IL-1 receptor antagonists (such as anakinra), or those targeting bacterial translocation, apoptosis (for example, emricasan) and/or liver regeneration, as well as antibiotics. In patients in the early stages of ALD, probiotics, prebiotics, molecules limiting oxidative stress and alleviating steatosis and/or reducing the progression of fibrosis should be developed, in close association with the management of alcohol dependence (Figure 3). The main ongoing studies of new targeted treatments in ALD can be found in Table 1.

Requirements for study designs
As in other fields of medical research, an urgent need exists to create the optimal scientific conditions for the development of new drugs in the area of ALD. These conditions include a clear definition of disease, a rational evaluation of severity to calculate sample size, the choice and validation of end points, the development and correct assessment of surrogate markers of outcome, as well as study designs for phase I to phase III trials. This scientific approach is necessary to correctly assess the effect of tested strategies on chosen end points. For example, a study design in heavy drinkers with steatosis alone should focus on the long-term progression of disease and use the development of cirrhosis as an end point. When considering the expected risk, a very large sample size is needed; thus noninvasive markers of fibrosis must be used because liver biopsy cannot be practiced in this case.

Most initial studies testing molecules in the field of alcoholic hepatitis underestimated the importance of this scientific approach. In particular there was no precise definition of the severity of liver disease, as shown by mortality in the control groups ranging from 0–100%.<sup>140,183</sup> The development of the Maddrey discriminant score was a major step in accurately calculating an adequate sample size based on a robust hypothesis of mortality in untreated patients.<sup>184</sup> Some experts do not recommend liver biopsy to diagnose alcoholic hepatitis and define disease severity. They suggest using combined clinical and biological criteria that have not yet been validated as diagnostic tools. Thus, studies that are not based on a histological diagnosis of disease have a 10–50% risk of including patients without disease.<sup>1,185,186</sup> These false positive inclusions substantially bias the statistical hypothesis by increasing the risk of type I and type II errors, because, by definition, the outcome of patients without alcoholic hepatitis should not be affected by molecules targeting the specific pathways driving disease progression.

Finally, experts and health agencies urgently need to agree on the different primary end points for phase I, II and III studies, so that pharmaceutical companies and scientific societies can plan on the development of future molecules. For example, phase I–II studies evaluating safety and the influence of molecules on liver injury must include patients with a minimal competitive risk of mortality to ensure sufficient exposure time. Phase III studies should focus on proof-of-efficacy on the basis of validated primary end points. Mortality alone should not be used as an end point, but to develop and propose surrogate markers strongly associated with outcome, such as early improvement of liver function.<sup>143,145,168,180</sup>

Conclusions
Scientific studies have made major progress in understanding the pathogenesis of and the effect of treatment in ALD. This Review discusses the need to build a bridge from the bench to the bedside as well as to adapt the design of future studies to the histological lesions of the disease and to mortality. For example, the sample size in studies evaluating molecules to reduce disease progression in patients with alcoholic steatosis must be extremely large with an end point that has been accepted by health agencies, such as the risk of developing cirrhosis. The study populations in these trials will have to be as large as those in cardiovascular studies and will have to use noninvasive markers to assess progression to cirrhosis. On the other hand, studies on alcoholic hepatitis must focus on short-term outcome and the development of surrogate markers to identify and validate new therapeutic pathways.
