**Abstract**

ΔFosB is a Fos family transcription factor that is induced by chronic exposure to cocaine and other drugs of abuse in the nucleus accumbens and related striatal regions, brain regions that are important for the behavioral effects of these drugs. To better understand the mechanisms by which ΔFosB contributes to the effects of chronic drug treatment, we used DNA microarray analysis to identify genes that are regulated in the nucleus accumbens upon ΔFosB expression in inducible bitransgenic mice. One of the most highly regulated genes was that encoding a subunit of another transcription factor,

nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB). Subsequent experiments confirmed the induction of NF-κB in the nucleus accumbens of mice overexpressing ΔFosB as well as in wild-type mice treated chronically, but not acutely, with cocaine. These results establish NF-κB as a putative target for ΔFosB and implicate NF-κB signaling pathways in the long-term adaptations of nucleus accumbens neurons to cocaine.

Keywords: cocaine, ΔFosB, gene expression, IkB, nucleus accumbens, transcription factors.

Drug addiction serves as a model to study the progressive changes that occur in brain after chronic perturbations, such as repeated exposure to psychoactive drugs (Nestler 2001). Neural plasticity as a result of drug exposure can be studied on many different levels depending on the time scale. In the fastest time frame, drugs influence neurotransmitter receptors, signal transduction pathways and ion channels to produce rapid but short-lived effects on the nervous system. Repeated perturbation of these signaling pathways over time alters the functioning of other downstream effectors and ultimately the *de novo* expression of certain proteins (Nestler *et al.* 1993). It is the last of these effects, the altered expression of proteins, which would be expected to have longer-lasting effects in neurons.

The best understood mechanism by which drug exposure alters the expression of proteins is through the regulation of transcription factors. Several transcription factors have been implicated in the long-term actions of drugs of abuse, including ΔFosB, CREB (cAMP response element binding protein), Egr (alternatively named Zif), glucocorticoid receptors and Nacl (Nestler *et al.* 1993; Piazza and Le Moal 1997; O'Donovan *et al.* 1999; Berke and Hyman 2000; Mackler *et al.* 2000; Nestler 2001). ΔFosB is unique, compared with these other transcription factors, in that it is induced appreciably only after repeated exposure to drugs of abuse, and its induction is a common adaptation to virtually all types of drugs of abuse. Once induced it persists in brain because of its extraordinarily long half-life (Hope *et al.* 1994; Moratalla *et al.* 1996; Nestler 2001; Nestler *et al.* 2001). Induction of ΔFosB by chronic exposure to drugs

of abuse occurs selectively in brain regions important for the behavioral actions of these drugs, most notably the ventral striatum (nucleus accumbens, NAc) and dorsal striatum (caudate-putamen). Moreover, overexpression of ΔFosB selectively in these regions in inducible bitransgenic mice increases an animal's sensitivity and incentive motivation for drugs of abuse, such as cocaine (Kelz *et al.* 1999; Nestler *et al.* 2001), whereas overexpression of a dominant negative antagonist of ΔFosB exerts the opposite behavioral effects (Peakman *et al.* 2000). These findings have led to the hypothesis that ΔFosB may mediate some of the long-lasting changes that chronic drug exposure causes in the brain, which lead to addiction (Nestler *et al.* 2001).

As a transcription factor, ΔFosB produces its functional effects through the regulation of other genes. In the present study, we used DNA microarrays to identify such downstream targets. One of the targets identified on the arrays was another transcription factor, nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), which we then

# Materials and methods

Bitransgenic male mice (line 11 A: NSE-tTA × Tetop-ΔFosB) that inducibly overexpress ΔFosB in NAc and other striatal regions were used in this study (Chen et al. 1998; Kelz et al. 1999). Mice were bred on doxycycline (100 μg/mL in the drinking water) to maintain no ΔFosB expression until 6 weeks of age, at which time one half of each litter continued on doxycycline (controls) and the other half was removed from doxycycline (ΔFosB overexpressors). The mice were used 8 weeks later, at which time ΔFosB expression was maximal in the mice withdrawn from doxycycline. Dissections of NAc (containing core and shell) were obtained as 12 gauge punches from 1-mm-thick coronal sections of brain from 23 control and 23 ΔFosB overexpressing mice. The dissections from each group were pooled, total RNA was isolated, and double-stranded cDNA was prepared using Custom Superscript cDNA synthesis kit (Life Technologies) and a custom T7-(dT)24 primer from Genset. The cDNA was purified by phenol/chloroform extraction and concentrated by ethanol precipitation. Biotin-labeled cRNA was then generated from the cDNA using Enzo’s *in vitro* transcription kit, and the resulting cRNA, after additional preparative steps, was hybridized in duplicate to Affymetrix DNA mouse chips. Results from the duplicates were averaged and then analyzed. In parallel studies, 32P-labeled cDNA probes derived from whole striatum of single transgenic NSE-tTA mice and from bitransgenic NSE-tTA × Tetop-ΔFosB (also line 11 A; all raised in the absence of doxycycline) were analyzed in triplicate with Atlas mouse filter paper arrays (Clonetech), exactly as described in Chen et al. (2000). In separate experiments involving western blotting, we used line 1 A bitransgenic mice, in addition to the line 11 A mice; the 1 A mice express much higher levels of ΔFosB in NAc and caudate-putamen compared with the 11 A mice (Chen et al. 1998).

ICR outbred mice (starting weight 28 g; Jackson Laboratories) were injected daily with either cocaine (20 mg/kg i.p.) or saline vehicle for 14 days. Animals were used 4 h after the last injection, at which time NAc and caudate-putamen dissections were obtained. Other mice received single injections of cocaine or saline and were used 4 h later. Extracts were prepared from dissected brain samples of individual mice by sonication in 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate. Protein concentrations were determined by Lowry assays. Western blotting was then performed followed by chemiluminescent detection, as described previously (Kelz et al. 1999). Antibodies directed against ΔFosB, NF-κB p105, IkB-γ p70, or NF-κB p65 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Protein levels were quantified by densitometry using National Institutes of Health IMAGE software and gray-scale calibration. Equal loading and transfer of gels was confirmed by amido black or Ponceau-S staining.

## Results

DNA microchips from Affymetrix were used to identify potential downstream targets of ΔFosB in the NAc of inducible bitransgenic mice. Of the 13 000 genes represented on two chips, 77 were found to be increased by between 2.5- and 9-fold upon ΔFosB expression, whereas 71 were found to be decreased by between 2.5- and 6-fold. The most highly up-regulated gene was that encoding the NF-κB subunit, p105, which showed 9-fold higher levels in ΔFosB expressing mice compared with littermate control mice. Interestingly, related experiments involving analysis of whole striatum from control and ΔFosB

expressing mice on cDNA filter-paper arrays from Clonetech showed weak up-regulation (25–50%) of NF-κB p105 as well as of the related protein, IkB-γ p70. Equivalent findings were obtained in several replicate arrays.

Based on the convergent findings from two independent microarray approaches, we used western blotting to confirm whether proteins in the NF-κB family are induced by ΔFosB in the NAc and caudate-putamen. We analyzed two lines of ΔFosB expressing mice: 11 A mice (used in the microarray experiments) that express levels of ΔFosB in the NAc and caudate-putamen comparable to those induced by chronic cocaine administration, and 1 A mice that express supraphysiological levels of ΔFosB in these regions (Chen et al. 1998; Kelz et al. 1999). Analysis of 11 A mice showed a two-fold induction of NF-κB p105 in the NAc (Fig. 1), and a smaller increase in caudate-putamen (~1.5-fold; data not shown), compared with control littermates (Fig. 1). Analysis of 1 A mice showed a 3.3-fold induction of NF-κB in whole striatum compared with control littermates.

We next examined whether levels of NF-κB p105 are up-regulated in the NAc and caudate-putamen by chronic cocaine administration, as would be expected based on the known induction of ΔFosB within these brain regions by cocaine. As shown in Fig. 2, levels of NF-κB p105 were increased 2-fold in the NAc, but were unchanged in the caudate-putamen, compared with saline-treated control mice. When whole striatum was analyzed, there was a trend for increased (41%) levels of NF-κB p105 in cocaine-treated mice compared with controls (data not shown).

We also examined the influence of cocaine on levels of other subunits in the NF-κB family. Chronic administration of cocaine tended to increase levels of the IkB-γ p70 and NF-κB p65 subunits by about 40% in the NAc (Fig. 2), with no change evident in the caudate-putamen (data not shown).

The ability of cocaine to alter levels of these three NF-κB family proteins in the NAc required chronic exposure. Thus, no change was seen in levels of NF-κB p105, IkB-γ p70 or NF-κB p65 after a single dose of cocaine (Fig. 2).

Extracts of NAc obtained from 11 A mice, or extracts from whole striatum obtained from 1 A mice, which express (−dox) or do not express (+dox) ΔFosB were analyzed for levels of NF-κB p105 and ΔFosB by western blotting. The results shown in the figure are representative of the analysis of three mice in each group (dox, doxycycline).

Induction of NF-κB p105 by ΔFosB and by chronic cocaine administration, found clearly in the NAc, was less apparent in the caudate-putamen. On the one hand, this is surprising because ΔFosB is expressed at comparable levels in both regions in the bitransgenic mice and after a course of chronic cocaine (Hope *et al.* 1994; Kelz *et al.* 1999). On the other hand, there are many precedents for a transcription factor differentially regulating specific target genes in different brain regions. For example, one target gene that has already been identified for ΔFosB, the AMPA glutamate receptor subunit GluR2, is regulated by ΔFosB in the NAc but not in the caudate-putamen (Kelz *et al.* 1999). In contrast, another putative target for ΔFosB, Cdk5 (cyclin-dependent protein kinase-5), is induced to the same extent in these two brain regions (Bibb *et al.* 2001). Although further work is needed to understand the mechanisms responsible for the differential effects of ΔFosB in the NAc vs. the caudate-putamen, the selective induction of NF-κB in the NAc is notable, as this region is believed to mediate the reinforcing effects of cocaine and other drugs of abuse, whereas the caudate-putamen is more associated with motoric effects of these agents (Nestler 2001). Further work is also needed to determine whether a similar induction of NF-κB occurs in the NAc after self-administration of cocaine, as seen for investigator-administered drug in the present study.

The functional role played by induction of NF-κB subunits by chronic exposure to cocaine remains unknown. NF-κB is best understood as a transcription factor that regulates responses to infection and cellular stress (Perkins 2000), but has more recently been implicated in neural development, synaptic transmission and neurodegenerative disease (reviewed in O’Neill and Kaltschmidt 1997; Blondeau *et al.* 2000; Mattson and Camandola 2001). Under basal conditions, NF-κB occurs as a cytoplasmic dimer composed of several possible subunits, typically NF-κB p50 and p65. The dimer is bound to an IkB subunit, which retains the complex in the cytoplasm. Upon cell stimulation, IkB is phosphorylated, which causes the dissociation of the NF-κB dimer and its subsequent translocation into the nucleus where the dimer functions as a transcription factor. The NF-κB p105 subunit examined in the present study is a precursor that is cleaved into NF-κB p50 and IkB-γ p70. NF-κB p65 is encoded by a distinct gene. The results of the present study therefore show that chronic cocaine administration increases levels of the precursor NF-κB p105, the inhibitory subunit IkB-γ p70 and the active transcription factor subunit NF-κB p65. In contrast, we could not detect NF-κB p50 in the NAc under control or cocaine-treated conditions, despite the fact that it was readily detected in peripheral tissues. Thus, further work is needed to determine whether the observed increases in particular NF-κB subunits results in a net increase or decrease in the activity of the NF-κB system.

Interestingly, other drugs of abuse have been reported to affect the NF-κB system: μ-opioid receptor agonists increase NF-κB in primary cultures of rat cortical neurons (Hou *et al.* 1996), whereas subacute exposures to methamphetamine increase NF-κB in striatum (Asanuma and Cadet 1998). It is interesting to speculate a possible relationship between the drug regulation of NF-κB and AIDS dementia, which is known to be exacerbated by drugs of abuse in part via actions on striatal regions (Nath *et al.* 2000). In cultured neurons, cocaine and

## Discussion

The main finding of this study is the identification of NF-κB subunits as targets of the transcription factor ΔFosB and of chronic cocaine administration in the NAc. Based on results from two microarray approaches, one employing oligonucleotides on silicon chips, the other employing cDNAs spotted onto filter papers, we found that the gene encoding the p105 subunit of NF-κB is one of the most highly regulated in the NAc upon overexpression of ΔFosB in inducible bitransgenic mice. The induction of NF-κB p105 by ΔFosB was verified by use of western blotting in a separate group of mice, and the degree of induction was related to the quantity of ΔFosB expressed in two different mouse lines.

We then went on to demonstrate that, as would be expected, chronic administration of cocaine, which induces ΔFosB in the NAc, also increases levels of NF-κB p105 in this brain region. In addition, there was a trend for chronic cocaine administration to increase levels of two related NF-κB subunits, IkB-γ p70 and NF-κB p65, in this region. NF-κB is a particularly interesting target for ΔFosB, given that it, too, functions as a transcription factor. This finding underscores the complexity of the molecular adaptations that are induced by cocaine via induction of ΔFosB. Thus, the increased levels of NF-κB p105 and related subunits would presumably produce functional effects in the NAc via the regulation of still other genes.

amphetamine increase the neurotoxic effects of the HIV proteins Tat and gp120 (Nath *et al.* 2000), and NF-κB activates the HIV promoter (Rattner *et al.* 1993). It is therefore possible that drugs of abuse exacerbate HIV infection by increasing NF-κB activity in specific regions of brain.

Results of candidate gene and microarray experiments indicate that NF-κB is one of many targets for ΔFosB. Thus, 148 out of 13 000 genes were found to be regulated up or down by more than 2.5-fold upon ΔFosB expression in the bitransgenic mice when using the DNA microchips reported here, whereas 34 out of 588 genes were reproducibly regulated when using filter-paper based arrays (Chen *et al.* 2000). A major task of current research is to evaluate which of these many genes are, like NF-κB, bona fide targets of ΔFosB and, by extension, cocaine. The possibility that ΔFosB may regulate a relatively large number of genes is not surprising given that numerous genes contain identifiable consensus AP1 sites within their regulatory regions (Morgan and Curran 1995). (The AP1 site refers to the seven nucleotide sequence of DNA to which ΔFosB and related Fos family transcription factors bind.) To date we have verified several targets for ΔFosB in the NAc and they include, in addition to NF-κB: GluR2 and Cdk5, as mentioned above, as well as the opioid peptide dynorphin (Shaw *et al.* 2000). A key challenge is to understand how regulation of numerous targets by ΔFosB is integrated to produce the changes in neuronal function and complex behavior subserved by this transcription factor.

In any event, the results of this study further demonstrate the powerful capability of DNA expression arrays to identify novel gene targets involved in biological processes such as drug addiction (Freeman *et al.* 2001). More specifically, this study now points to a possible role of the NF-κB transcription factor family in the molecular mechanisms of long-term plasticity underlying addiction.
