**ABSTRACT**

The causes of spinal cord cell loss in motor neuron disorders such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are currently unknown. A role can be postulated for the transcription factor p53, which can induce apoptosis via upregulation of proapoptotic genes (e.g., Bax) and inhibition of antiapoptotic genes (e.g., Bcl-2). A model of motor neuron loss is the wobbler mouse that exhibits rapid motor neuron cell death as well as motor deficit from 21 days after birth. Affymetrix microarray data from wobbler mice demonstrate a 2.2-fold increase in p53 signal compared with their normal littermates, whereas qRT-PCR of RNA from laser capture microdissected ventral horns of normal and wobbler mice reveals a larger 6.6-fold increase in gene expression and this was supported by western blotting. Human ventral horns obtained from ALS and age-matched normal spinal cords also demonstrated an increase (2.7-fold) in p53 expression as determined by qRT-PCR. Evidence of a causative role for p53 in spinal cord cell death was provided by use of a p53 inhibitor, pifithrin-$\alpha$, in organotypic slice cultures of mouse spinal cord. A 24-h pretreatment with pifithrin-$\alpha$ (and continuing in the presence of insult), significantly reduced the toxicity of a 48-h treatment with FeSO$_{4}$, tested with the MTT viability assay. These results indicate that p53 plays a functional role in oxidative stress-induced cell death and supports the possibility that elevated p53 could be involved in motor neuron death in ALS and the wobbler mouse.

**1. Introduction**

Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), a motor neuron disease, also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease, is a debilitating disorder that occurs due to progressive degeneration of the motor neurons of the spinal cord, resulting in a loss of movement. Generally, the prognosis is poor with the vast majority of patients dying within 5 years of diagnosis (one famous exception being the renowned British astrophysicist, Stephen Hawking).

similar to that seen in human ALS (reviewed in Bendotti and Carri, 2004).

An alternative model displaying aspects of ALS is the wobbler mouse, in which motor neurons begin to die within 3 weeks of birth, resulting in declining forelimb function, eventual paralysis and death (Duchen and Strich, 1968; Falconer, 1956). This model is caused by a recently identified recessive mutation in the gene for vacuolar-vesicular protein sorting factor 54 (Schmitt-John et al., 2005), and it is unclear how this causes motor neuron cell death since mutations of a homologous protein in humans result in a different type of disorder-kidney failure.

Recently, the tumor suppressor and transcription factor, p53, has been linked to cell death in a number of disorders (reviewed in Culmsee and Mattson, 2005). It can be induced following DNA damage, either arresting the cell cycle or activating apoptosis. This protein can induce the expression of pro-apoptotic genes, such as bax, and downregulate anti-apoptotic genes, such as bcl-2 (Mihara et al., 2003). It is mutated in the majority of cancerous cells and therefore no longer functions to switch on apoptotic gene expression, allowing cells to proliferate (reviewed by Steele et al., 1998). However, if it became active in normal cells then rampant apoptotic cell death could occur due to the switching on of pro-apoptotic and switching off of anti-apoptotic genes (such as the upregulation of activated caspase-3 and downregulation of bcl-2, respectively).

Previous studies have shown a link between apoptosis and neurodegeneration in ALS and transgenic animal models (Li et al., 2000; Martin, 1999), and therefore the presence of activated caspase-3 in wobbler spinal cord was investigated. Fortunately, an inhibitor of p53 activity has recently been identified from screening studies for a molecule capable of reducing p53 upregulation of a reporter β-galactosidase, without affecting cell growth and it is known as pifithrin-α, for p fifty-three inhibitor (Komarov et al., 1999; Zhu et al., 2002).

Studies have suggested that p53 expression may be increased in ALS (Martin, 2000), though studies in familial ALS transgenic mice models in general do not support this (Kuntz et al., 2000; Prudlo et al., 2000; though see Gonzalez de Aguilar et al., 2000, for a dissenting view). We therefore wished to confirm these findings using the alternative wobbler mouse model of ALS and examine the link between cell death and p53 expression in the wobbler mouse model of ALS. We performed microarray analysis of mRNA levels in the ventral spinal cord from wobbler mice and gene expression changes were verified by quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) of ventral horn spinal cord from ALS and wobbler mice to demonstrate increased p53 expression. The role of apoptosis was investigated by looking for evidence of caspase-3 activation by western blotting for the active p17/p19 fragments of the intact p32 caspase-3, as well as the use of a caspase-3 activity assay.

The familial ALS mutation in the SOD1 gene supports a role for oxidative stress in the etiology of ALS, and therefore an inducer of oxidative stress, ferrous sulphate (FeSO₄), can be used to test neuron survivability. Protection against oxidative stress-induced cell death in mouse organotypic spinal cul-

tures following p53 inhibition with pifithrin-α was therefore performed to investigate a functional link between p53 and cell susceptibility.

### 2. Results

#### 2.1. Behavioral testing changes coincide with phenotype development

Loss of front paw motor function was confirmed with a rotarod. A variety of testing methods have been reported with either constant speeds up to 15 rpm or accelerating rotation. A comparison, with another spinal motor disorder, was described (Lesbordes et al., 2003) and based on this, and our own trials, we found a relatively sensitive testing procedure. The wobbler mice were unable to stay on the rotating dowel for any significant period of time compared with their normal littermates at 21 (P < 0.05), 28 (P < 0.001) and 35 days (P < 0.001) after birth (see Table 1). This phenotype was not evident at 14 days (data not shown).

#### 2.2. p53 mRNA expression is upregulated in both human ALS and wobbler spinal cords

The microarray data comparing wobbler and normal littermates revealed that one third of the 36,000 genes on the Affymetrix 430 2.0 mouse chip were expressed within the spinal cord. The relative expression of p53 is increased 2.2-fold in the wobbler mouse compared to normal littermates (Fig. 1). This observation was confirmed by qRT-PCR for p53, of RNA extracted from the spinal cords of wobbler and normal littermates. RNA was also extracted from the ventral horn region of the spinal cord by laser capture microdissection (Fig. 2A) and qRT-PCR for p53, and GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) as a reference gene was performed. Comparison of the expression levels revealed a 6.6-fold increase in p53 mRNA expression in the wobbler mouse compared with its normal littermate (Fig 2B).

p53 expression was also investigated in the human ALS spinal cord, and when the RNA was extracted from whole spinal cord, a 2.1-fold increase in expression was observed in ALS compared to normal cord. Extracting from just the ventral horn revealed a larger 2.7-fold increase in p53 expression (Fig. 2C).

RNAs from three different mice per group, at 21 days after birth, were examined with the microarrays and the increase in p53 mRNA was statistically significant (*P* < 0.05, *t*-test). At this age, the *wr/wr* mice exhibited front paw weakness. The center diagonal indicates similarly expressed genes in both groups and the outer diagonals correspond to two-fold increases or decreases in expression.

### 2.3. Western examination of p53 and caspase-3

Protein analysis by western blotting confirmed the increased p53 expression in the wobbler mouse compared to normal littermates. A more intense band around 50 kDa was observed in the wobbler mouse, compared with the control mice (Fig. 3).

One possible mechanism by which p53 may induce cell death is the activation of apoptosis. We therefore looked for the presence of p17/p19 active fragments of caspase-3 (intact p32) in the wobbler spinal cord, compared with its normal littermates, as well as in the organotypic slices. Western blotting revealed the presence of intact caspase-3, but the cleaved forms could not be convincingly shown to be produced in either the wobbler mouse, compared with its littermates, or in the unprotected slices compared with those protected from oxidative stress by pifithrin-α. The protein samples were pooled and passed through a Millipore Ultra-free-MC centrifugal filter unit (nominal molecular weight limit of 5 kDa) to try and maximize p17/p19 concentration and faint bands of similar intensity were seen in the wobbler and littermate lanes, though faint bands of this size were not apparent in either of the pooled organotypic samples. Recombinant, active caspase-3 was tested as a positive control and was clearly visible at approximately 19 kDa.

No changes in the expression of these subunits, or of intact caspase-3, were apparent. A caspase-3 activity assay was also performed (data not shown), and a caspase-3-dependent component of cell death was not detected in the wobbler mice or in the oxidative stress-treated organotypic spinal cord slices.

### 2.4. The involvement of p53 in a model of cell death

We demonstrated that p53 was upregulated in both human ALS and wobbler mice, but the question remained as to whether p53 could play a causative role in spinal cord cell death. We therefore modeled the wild-type spinal cord in organotypic culture to test whether inhibition of p53 could provide protection against an oxidative insult (*FeSO₄*). Since previous studies suggested that during the first 3 days of growing spinal cord in culture, apoptotic cell death would peak due to the effect of traumatizing the cord in slicing it, the slices were grown for 7 days before pretreating, so as to ensure that any apoptosis observed was due to the oxidative insult and not the trauma. As Fig. 4A shows, the dorsal and ventral horns were still apparent in the slices, showing the continued viability of the spinal cord slices after 10 days, demonstrated by MTT (3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) staining. The slices were pretreated for 24 h with pifithrin-α or vehicle (DMSO; dimethyl sulfoxide), before 42–48 h treatment with *FeSO₄*. Pilot studies also tested the effect of pretreating with pifithrin-α and DMSO on untreated slices and no significant effects were observed (data not shown). MTT staining revealed a decreased viability (as shown by decreased staining intensity and reduced OD readings) in *FeSO₄*-treated slices compared with untreated slices (Fig. 4B). Pretreatment with pifithrin-α was shown to increase the viability of the slices following oxidative stress. This suggested that the oxidative stress-induced cell loss by *FeSO₄* was p53-dependent (Fig. 4B).

### 3. Discussion

The direct cause of cell death in ALS and the animal motor neuron disease model, the wobbler mouse, is unknown. However, a role for p53 in motor neuron susceptibility is indicated by our findings. Overexpression of p53 in the ventral horn of spinal cord from both ALS and wobbler mice was detected by qRT-PCR and microarray analysis. All cells express p53 and our data indicate that the region of the spinal cord involved in motor function undergoes changes in p53 during neurodegeneration greater than the spinal cord as a whole. A functional role for p53 in cell death was also demonstrated in mice treated with *FeSO₄* to induce oxidative stress since a significant reduction in cell death was observed following p53 inhibition with pifithrin-α.

The observed upregulation of p53 could occur as a result of a number of pathways probably triggered by oxidative DNA damage (e.g., JNK, ATM/CHK2, the cell cycle CDK4 and 6/pRb/E2F1 or PARP-1 pathways). This upregulation could lead to transcriptional activation of a number of pro-apoptotic genes and the suppression of anti-apoptotic genes, thus promoting apoptotic cell death (reviewed in Culmsee and Mattson, 2005). However, caspase-3 activity was not seen in either the wobbler mouse or the organotypic cultures, as determined by negligible difference in the levels of p17/p19 fragments being observed by western blotting or an absence of activity using the caspase-3 activity assay. This is in contrast to the findings of Dave et al. (2005) who performed immunohistochemistry

(A) Example of before (intact) and after laser capture of the ventral horns from a mouse spinal cord. (B) p53 expression (relative to GAPDH expression) increased in the wobbler mouse ventral horn by 6.6-fold. (C) In complete spinal cord from ALS patients, p53, relative to 18S expression, was higher in affected cords by 2.1-fold, and this increased to a 2.7-fold elevation when only ventral horn expressions were compared. The total and ventral horn human spinal cord data were normalized to the values obtained from age-matched unaffected total and ventral horn spinal cord extracts and these control bars are not shown. The error bars indicate standard deviations and the means all differed significantly from controls (*P* < 0.05 by *t*-test).

using an antibody specific for the active fragments of caspase-3, compared to the antibody that recognizes both the intact and active enzyme used by us. This suggests that either the level of caspase activity in our samples was too low to be detected under these conditions, or that p53 was causing cell death in a caspase-3-independent way. This will be discussed later.

Elucidation of the triggering mechanisms for the upregulation of p53 and whether specific proapoptotic genes are involved should be the next step in clarifying the role of p53 in ALS. Since the increased p53 observed in ALS is also present in the wobbler mouse, as determined here, but not in the familial ALS G93A SOD1 mutant transgenic mouse ([Kuntz et al., 2000](https://doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-4547(20000101)247:1<1::AID-JCP1>3.0.CO;2-9); [Prudlo et al., 2000](https://doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-4547(20000101)247:1<1::AID-JCP1>3.0.CO;2-9)), the wobbler mouse may turn out to have some features more in common with ALS. However, an increase in p53 has been detected in the familial ALS G86R SOD1 mutant transgenic mouse model ([Gonzalez de Aguilar et al., 2000](https://doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-4547(20000101)247:1<1::AID-JCP1>3.0.CO;2-9)). The expression of p53 would need to be studied in familial ALS cases specifically to see whether the SOD transgenic mouse exhibits the same response as familial ALS patients with respect to p53 expression.

This study gives credence to the use of p53 inhibitors as potential treatments for ALS, though the next step would be to show that pifithrin treatment of wobbler mice improves or rescues them, before attempting to test p53 inhibitors in

Fig. 3 – p53 protein expression in wobbler mice. p53 protein expression modestly increased in wobbler mice (wr) compared with normal littermates (wt), with GAPDH as a loading control. The upper panel was incubated with anti-p53 and the lower panel with anti-GAPDH primary antibodies. Lane 1 displays an example in the wr/wr strain of the elevated p53 antigen present relative to the GAPDH housekeeping protein. The p53 protein level, measured by intensity levels with Kodak 1D software, was 1.7-fold higher in the wr/wr strain compared to the controls.

(B) A 24-h pretreatment with pifithrin-α afforded a significant improvement in the viability of 48 h treated FeSO₄-treated spinal organotypic cultures (*P* < 0.01; *n* = 5).

clinical trials. p53 plays a role in a number of pathways relating to cell survival and cell death depending on the degree of stress. p53 is relatively unstable, but it is phosphorylated under conditions of high stress, thus promoting its stability and hence activity. Typically p53 is activated when DNA damage occurs or the cell is stressed and it translocates to the nucleus, where it can induce pro-apoptotic gene expression, such as bax and bid and block anti-apoptotic gene expression (e.g., bcl-2). p53 activates DNA damage restoration processes (el-Deiry et al., 1993; Gottifredi et al., 2004), or apoptosis if the DNA damage cannot be repaired (Copani et al., 2001). This effect of cell cycle entry may allow a cell to recover from DNA damage without replication (Claycomb et al., 2004; Yang et al., 2006). Since neurons are terminally differentiated, the importance of this is unclear. There is increasing evidence that the neurons that die in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease and ALS may have attempted to inappropriately re-enter the cell cycle and typically do not die immediately following this, but sometime later, possibly suggesting a ‘two-hit’ process may be at work (Jordan-Sciutto et al., 2003; Ranganathan and Bowser, 2003; Yang et al., 2006).

However, p53 also plays an important role in the regulation of cancer due to its ability to induce cell death, and a majority of cancerous cells possess malfunctioning p53. It is therefore unclear whether highly detrimental (potentially cancerous) side effects could occur with this treatment. Recent studies also suggest that p53 plays a role in mediating autophagy, free radical activity, as well as regulating glucose metabolism and mitochondrial respiration, which in turn can activate apoptosis (Bensaad et al., 2006; Crighton et al., 2006; Matoba et al., 2006; Sablina et al., 2005). A more complex picture of the actions of p53 is developing with recent studies suggesting that under normal conditions, p53 provides survival signaling (such as DNA repair and the induction of antioxidant genes) which switches to ‘death signals’ (such as induction of pro-apoptotic genes and molecules that will promote free radical production) under conditions of severe stress (Sablina et al., 2005).

Apoptosis clearly plays a role in p53-induced cell death, but there is increasing evidence that this is not the whole story, and apoptosis-independent cell death may also occur due to p53 activation, for example the earlier mention of its role in autophagy and free radical generation and removal. p53-dependent tumor suppression does not necessarily require the induction of p53-dependent apoptosis, instead acting via modulation of chromosomal stability, resulting in aneuploidy (Liu et al., 2004). Our results do appear to suggest a non-

apoptotic (or at least a caspase-3-independent) mode of cell
death in both the wobbler mouse and oxidative stress-
dependent cell death. This would appear to be in contradiction
to previously published observations showing caspase-3
activation in the wobbler mouse by immunocytochemistry
(Dave et al., 2005) and oxidative stress-induced cell death
(Kruman et al., 1997). We therefore need to confirm this result
by performing other markers for apoptosis, such as electron
microscopic examination, annexin V staining and terminal
deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling
(TUNEL), as well as increasing the sample size to ensure
that the scarcity of the number of cells undergoing apoptosis
at any one time, is not the reason for the lack of detection of
active caspase-3 using western blotting. The recent finding of
an antioxidant role (or pro-oxidant under conditions of stress)
provides an additional means whereby p53 could contribute to
cell death in wobbler mice and organotypic cultures. Further
study is required to determine if this is the mode of cell death
in this disease state or model.

In conclusion, p53 expression is upregulated in areas that
show neurodegeneration in the spinal cord of both ALS
patients and wobbler mice, based on microarray, qRT-PCR
and western blotting. Future experiments focusing on motor
neurons and with more sensitive assays will be able to
discriminate cell death pathways involved. Inhibition of p53
by pifithrin-α can reduce the susceptibility of mouse spinal
cord slices to oxidative stress-induced cell death by an, as yet
to be determined, mechanism that could involve apoptotic or
free radical induction.

### 4. Experimental procedures

A colony of wobbler mice was rederived (Jackson Laboratories)
from frozen embryos we obtained from NIH (Dr. Carl Hansen)
and maintained for use at the Bay Pines VA. All experiments
were carried out in compliance with the Bay Pines VA IACUC
committee. All postmortem work on human sourced material
was sanctioned by the Bay Pines VA IRB and met local and
national guidelines.

#### 4.1. Behavioral testing

The wobbler mice and their normal littermates (*n* = 3) were
acclimated to a rotarod (Model 57620 from Stoelting) with at
least 3 training runs at 4 rpm at 14 days old. Training runs were
only repeated as needed for older mice and in all cases were
performed at least 30 min prior to the actual performance
tests. For every performance test, each mouse was tested 3
times, with at least 3 min of rest between trials. Only the
longest time from each trio of tests was used for analysis.

#### 4.2. Microarray

RNA was extracted from wobbler mouse spinal cords using
Trizol reagents (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and further purified
with the RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) as described by the
manufacturers. cDNA was transcribed from the RNA and
biotin-labeled and then fragmented and hybridized to the
Affymetrix (Santa Clara, CA) 430 2.0 mouse chip at the Moffitt
Center, at the University of South Florida, Tampa. The
microarray data were analyzed using Genespring v.7 (Agilent
Technologies/Silicon Genetics, Santa Clara, CA).

#### 4.3. qRT-PCR and laser capture microdissection

Four normal and four ALS cervical spinal cords (obtained from
the University of Maryland Brain Bank) were freeze-mounted
in OCT mounting media and 20-μm sections were cut on a
cryostat. Either whole tissue or tissue scrapes of just the
ventral horns from the ALS sections were processed for RNA
extraction using the Picopure Kit (Molecular Devices/Arcturus,
Mountain View, CA).

Three normal and three 35-day-old wobbler mice were
euthanized by CO₂ inhalation, and the spinal column was
removed and frozen in OCT media (Tissue Tek). Twenty-
micrometer sections were cut on the cryostat and the
remaining spinal column tissue was scraped off to leave the
intact spinal cord. The ventral horns were excised by laser
capture microdissection (Arcturus Pixcell IIe) and the RNA
extracted using the PicoPure Kit (Arcturus).

The extracted RNA from human and mouse tissue was
analyzed by qRT-PCR, run in triplicate on the Opticon DNA
engine (Bio-Rad/MJ Research, Hercules, CA), using the Qiagen
SYBR-Green kit to detect the cDNA products. The following
primers (synthesized by IDT, Coralville, IA) and conditions
were used—mouse p53: upstream 5′-GGC AAC TAT GGC TTC
CAC C, downstream 5′-TGA CCC ACA ACT GCA CAG G; mouse
GAPDH: downstream 5′-GGC AAA TTC AAC GGC ACA G,
upstream 5′-ATC CAC GAC GGA CAC ATT G; human p53:
downstream 5′-TGA CAG CAC AGC CCA GTA AG, upstream 5′-
CCT CAG GCT CTG GTG ACT TC; human 18S: downstream 5′-
GCT CGC TCC TCT CCT ACT TG, upstream 5′-CCC TCT CCG
GAA TCG AAC at 30 min RT at 50 °C, followed by 15 min
activation at 95 °C and a 15-s denaturation at 94°. Thirty
seconds of annealing at 57° (human) or 52° (mouse) was
followed by 15 s dissociation of any primer-dimer at 79 °C
and a plate read of SYBR Green bound to product. This was
cycled 45 times to compare p53 expression between normal
and ALS human tissue and normal and wobbler mouse tissue,
using GAPDH (mouse) and 18S (human) expression as
reference genes. The products were verified by agarose gel
electrophoresis.

#### 4.4. Western Blotting for caspase-3 and p53

Protein extraction was performed on three wobbler and
normal spinal cords taken from 35-day-old mice, in the
presence of 1% Sigma (St. Louis, MO) proteinase inhibitor
cocktail in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 for p53 and the Biomol
(Plymouth Meeting, PA) cell lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.4,
0.1% CHAPS, 5 mM DTT, 0.1 mM EDTA) for caspase-3 activity,
followed by a 30-s homogenization and 15 min centrifugation
at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected and stored at −70 °C.
Protein concentration was determined by a Pierce (Rockford,
IL) bicinchonic acid (BCA) assay.

Extracted protein samples (1.5–10 μg) were separated by
electrophoresis on an Invitrogen bis-tris gel for 30 min at
200 V, before transferring to a PVDF membrane (Invitrogen)
for 1 h at 30 V. The blot was blocked using 1% BSA, 0.05%

Tween-20 in PBS for 1 h at 37°C prior to an overnight incubation (19–20 h) at 4 °C with the following concentrations of the rabbit polyclonal antibodies for caspase-3 (recognizes intact and activated fragments of caspase-3; 1:250; Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA), GAPDH (1:1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) or the mouse monoclonal antibody for p53 (1:3000; Santa Cruz) in the blocking buffer. After 3 washes in Tris-buffered saline and Tween-20, a 30-min incubation with a biotinylated goat anti rabbit IgG (1:4000; Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA) or biotinylated goat anti mouse IgG (1:3000; Pierce) at 37 °C was performed. Washing was repeated followed by 30 min incubation with an SABC (avidin-biotin) complex (1:2000; Vector Labs) at 37 °C. Antibody visualization was accomplished with the Pierce Supersignal West Dura Extended Duration Substrate kit and photographed, using the Kodak Image Station 440 CE, and the presence of activated (p17 and p19) and intact caspase-3 (p32) and p53 in the wobbler mouse spinal cords was determined.

### 4.5. Organotypic cultures

This was performed as described by Xiang et al. (2000) for long-term organotypic cultures. Briefly, five 30-day-old mice were euthanized by CO₂ inhalation and 2–2 cm segments of spinal cord were removed and transferred to cold Dulbecco’s Modified Essential Medium (GIBCO/Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) containing 1% streptomycin-penicillin. The spinal cords were embedded in 2% agarose (FMC, Philadelphia, PA) in 0.9% saline and cut at 400 μm on a vibratome before being returned to the cold DMEM. Four spinal cord slices were placed on Millicell (Millipore, Billerica, MA) membranes in 6-well plates of 1 ml media (25% horse serum, 50% Basal Medium Eagle, 25% Hank’s balanced salt solution, 6% glucose, 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.3) to give a total of 4 wells each for 2 groups per animal. The slices were incubated at 37 °C, under 5% CO₂. The media were replaced at day 4 with a physiological potassium media that was the same media as before, except the potassium chloride concentration was reduced to 2.66 mM (from 3.96 mM) in the Earle’s balanced salt solution. Following 1 week of stabilization of growth, the slices were pretreated for 24 h with 1 μM pifithrin-α (or DMSO vehicle 0.2%). The media were then replaced with fresh physiological potassium media containing pifithrin-α (1 μM) or vehicle (0.2% DMSO) and fresh 250 μM FeSO₄ for 42–48 h. 12.5 μl of 5 mg/ml MTT was added to the media of the slices and incubated at 37 °C for a further 2 h. The slices were then photographed, and the purple-colored MTT-formazan was extracted in acidified propanol. The OD of homogenates were measured at 570 nm and background, at 650 nm, was subtracted. Protein was also extracted from organotypic tissue (4 slices per well) to see if active caspase-3 could be detected by either western blotting or activity assay.

### 4.6. Caspase-3 activity assay

Caspase-3 activity was studied on protein extracted from either organotypic slices or whole spinal cord using the Biomol caspase-3 Cellular Assay Kit Plus. Briefly, protein is extracted using their cell lysis buffer as described above and its ability to metabolize the substrate Ac-DEVD-pNA to pNA measured spectrophotometrically over a period of 30 min, and the rate of metabolism determined.

### 4.7. Statistics

The rotarod data were compared using the t-test, taking P < 0.05 as significant. The microarray data were analyzed using Genespring v7.0. The qRT-PCR data was compared by normalizing the change in threshold cycle for p53 values to those for the reference gene 18s (or GAPDH) and then using the Student’s t-test to compare the normal and ALS or wobbler and normal littermate values, taking P < 0.05 as significant. The MTT (and caspase-3 levels) were compared using the Students t-test, taking P < 0.05 as significant.
