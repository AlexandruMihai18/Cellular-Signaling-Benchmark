1. Introduction  

GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid) is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain and is essential for the overall balance between neuronal excitation and inhibition. GABA influences neurons via a large number of receptor subtypes which are grouped on the basis of their pharmacology under three major classes of receptors: GABAA, GABAB, and GABAC receptors. GABAA and GABAC receptors are ligand gated ion channels, while GABAB receptors are G-protein coupled receptors. This Perspective compares and contrasts aspects of the medicinal chemistry and molecular biology of GABAA and GABAC receptors. The molecular diversity of these ligand gated ion channels represents important challenges for medicinal chemists in the design of subunit-specific therapeutic agents.  

GABAA receptors were reviewed in the *Journal of Medicinal Chemistry* by Krogsgaard-Larsen and colleagues in 1994 in a Perspective titled “GABAA Receptor Agonists, Partial Agonists, and Antagonists: Design and Therapeutic Prospects”. There continues to be extensive investigations of GABAA receptors, particularly with respect to their modulation by important drugs, such as the benzodiazepines, ethanol, general anesthetics, barbiturates, and a wide range of chemically diverse substances. Johnston has described GABAA receptors as “the most complicated of the superfamily of ligand-gated ion channels in terms of the large number of receptor subtypes and also the variety of ligands that interact with specific sites on the receptors.”  

There are many excellent, extensive reviews on aspects of GABAA receptors. GABAC receptors appear to be much simpler than GABAA receptors, but they have not been studied anywhere nearly as intensively as GABAA receptors.  

1.1. Ligand Gated Ion Channels. Ligand gated ion channels (LGICs) mediate fast synaptic transmission via the movement of ions through channels gated by neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine and GABA. These receptors are very different from G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) that were the subject of a recent Perspective in the *Journal of Medicinal Chemistry*. The nicotinicoid superfamily of LGICs encompasses several families of receptors including nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, 5-HT3 receptors, GABAA receptors, GABAC receptors, strychnine-sensitive glycine receptors, and some invertebrate anionic glutamate receptors. Other superfamilies of LGICs include the excitatory glutamate receptors (with subfamilies of NMDA, AMPA, and kainate receptors) and the ATP receptors (which currently consist of a single family). From the nicotinicoid superfamily of LGICs, the most studied and best understood of this class of receptors is the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, while the GABAA receptors appear to be the most complex and the GABAC receptors the simplest.  

Members of the nicotinicoid superfamily are considered to be pentamers composed of protein subunits likely to have been derived from a common ancestor. As illustrated in Figure 1A, each subunit has a large extracellular N-terminal domain which incorporates

Representations of GABA-activated ligand-gated ion channels:** A, general structure of one of the five protein subunits showing four membrane-spanning regions; B, pentameric arrangement of the protein subunits showing the second membrane spanning region lining the pore of the ion channel; C, heteromeric makeup of a GABAA receptor with two α1, two β2, and one γ2 protein subunits; and D, homomeric makeup of a GABAc receptor with five ρ1 protein subunits.

part of the agonist/antagonist-binding site, followed by three membrane-spanning domains (M1–3), an intracellular loop of variable length and a fourth membrane-spanning domain (M4), and the C-terminal end being extracellular. Each subunit arranges itself such that the second membrane-spanning domain (M2) forms the wall of the channel pore (Figure 1B) and the overall charge of the domain determines whether the channel conducts anions or cations. Both GABAA and GABAc receptors are GABA-gated chloride ion channels causing inhibition of neuronal firing, with GABAA receptors being heteromeric, i.e., composed of different subunits (e.g., α1, β2, and γ2 subunits as illustrated in Figure 1C) and GABAc receptors being homomeric (e.g., composed exclusively of ρ1 subunits, Figure 1D). The cytoplasmic loop (Figure 1A), between the third and fourth transmembrane domains (M3 and M4), is believed to be the target for protein kinases, required for subcellular targeting and membrane clustering of the receptor.

The hierarchy within the nicotinicoid superfamily of LGICs as described by Le Novere and Changeux<sup>18</sup> is as follows: the first rank is the family defined by the endogenous ligand responsible for channel opening; the second rank is the subfamily defined by the ability to form endogenous receptors together; and the last rank is the tribe. In the present context of the GABA-activated LGIC family, GABAA and GABAc receptors are subfamilies, while the tribes are the protein subunits that show substantial sequence identity, e.g., the six α subunits, the four β subunits, etc., and the three ρ subunits.

The optimized alignment of the human GABAA β1 and GABAc ρ1 amino acid sequences from Le Novere and Changeux<sup>18</sup> shows overall 172 matching amino acids between these proteins equating to an optimized sequence identity of 36%. Similar matching between human GABAA α1 and human GABAc ρ1 sequences shows significantly less sequence identity: overall 128 matching amino acids, 28% optimized sequence identity, about 50% identity in the transmembrane-spanning domains, and 44% identity in a 71-amino acid sequence of the N-terminal extracellular domain.

### 1.2. Recombinant Receptors: Complementary Structure–Activity Studies.
The ability to express functional receptors composed of proteins of known amino acid sequence in suitable biological cells, e.g., frog

Perspective

oocytes or human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells, that do not normally express such receptors has revolutionized our understanding of LGICs. Cloning studies have yielded a variety of sequence-related nucleotides that code for a variety of closely related membrane-bound LGIC receptors. When injected into appropriate cells, these cells will express functional LGIC recombinant receptors that can be studied by conventional electrophysiological recording techniques, e.g., two-electrode voltage clamp studies, or by radioligand binding studies. This technology enables structure–activity studies on a series of related compounds to be carried out on clearly defined receptor subtypes.

The native nucleotides coding for these receptors may be subjected to site-directed mutagenesis or cutting and splicing techniques to produce mutants or chimeras. On injection into appropriate cells, these nonnative nucleotides may produce mutant or chimeric receptors that have different functional properties to the native receptors. This technology thus enables systematic variation of the receptors themselves and can be used to delineate which amino acid residues are responsible for the pharmacological and physiological properties of the receptors.

Structure–activity relationship (SAR) studies involving structural variations of both the ligands and their receptor targets (termed complementary structure–activity studies)²¹ play important roles in drug development, being vital to the discovery of drugs that interact selectively with particular native and mutant receptor subtypes. Inheritable mutations in the nicotinicoid superfamily of LGICs, including GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, have been identified.²²

1.3. How GABA Activates LGICs. Ligand binding to LGICs has been generally considered to be diffusion-limited, i.e., fast, with binding affinity being primarily determined by the rate of ligand dissociation. This appears to be the case for nicotinic LGICs where the binding of acetylcholine is almost as fast as that predicted if the rate-limiting step is the diffusion of acetylcholine into its binding site. Two recent studies on GABA-activated LGICs suggest, however, that GABA binds orders of magnitude more slowly to GABA<sub>A</sub> and GABA<sub>C</sub> receptors than expected for relatively free diffusion.

Jones et al.²³ used patch clamping of rat hippocampal neurons in culture to study what defines ligand affinity at these native GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors. Their results indicate that a ligand-specific energy barrier between unbound and bound states determines GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor selectivity. They quantitatively model this barrier by requiring the participation of movable elements within a flexible binding site. Their flexible binding-site model envisages the binding site behaving as a pair of mobile ‘arms’ attached to fixed ‘anchor’ sites by spring-like tethers. Binding is diffusion-limited only if the ligand is long enough to span the distance between these wells. Shorter agonists bind more slowly because the arms must move to accommodate them, which requires activation energy. The model explicitly requires the ligand to perform thermodynamic work and implies that only nondiffusion-limited ligands can be agonists because otherwise they cause no movement of the receptor. Successful agonist binding involves the coordinated

Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, 2000, Vol. 43, No. 8 1429

motion of separate parts of the receptor, and variations of a fraction of an angstrom or a single hydrogen bond cause quite large changes in affinity.

Chang and Weiss²⁴ studied the relationship between agonist binding and channel gating by measuring radioligand binding of GABA agonists to single oocytes expressing recombinant human ρ1 GABA<sub>C</sub> receptors and directly correlating the binding kinetics with electrophysiological measurements. They showed that the association rate for GABA is 4 orders of magnitude slower than diffusion, indicating that GABA has restricted access to its binding site. They interpret their results in terms of a minimalist five-state model involving the sequential binding of three agonist molecules to the receptor and a transition to the open channel. Chang and Weiss²⁴ envisage the channel opening locking the agonist molecules onto the GABA<sub>C</sub> receptor. Colquhoun²⁵ has raised some problems of interpretation with this study. For example, there seems to be about 10 times as many binding sites as the number of receptors inferred from the maximum current. However, Colquhoun²⁵ is enthusiastic about the overall interpretation that the GABA agonist remains bound while the receptor is active, i.e., while the channel is open.

The GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor activation model of Jones et al.²³ involves ligand-induced changes in a dynamic receptor, while the GABA<sub>C</sub> receptor activation model of Chang and Weiss²⁴ involves the receptor changing between at least five different states in the presence of an activating ligand. Each model involves much slower binding of agonists than that allowed by diffusion and consequently much slower dissociation of bound agonists in order to accommodate what can be measured as equilibrium affinity constants. The five different states envisaged by Chang and Weiss²⁴ possibly equate to low-energy states of a dynamic receptor as envisaged by Jones et al.,²³ although there are significant differences between the channel properties of GABA<sub>A</sub> and GABA<sub>C</sub> receptors (see section 2.1).

2. Similarities and Differences between the GABA<sub>A</sub> and GABA<sub>C</sub> LGIC Subfamilies

GABA<sub>A</sub> and GABA<sub>C</sub> receptors are classified as subfamilies of the GABA LGIC family on the basis of their significant physiological, pharmacological, and molecular biological differences.

The protein subunits that make up the GABA<sub>A</sub> and GABA<sub>C</sub> LGIC subfamilies show up to 36% optimized sequence identity overall and up to 73% sequence identity in the transmembrane spanning regions.¹⁸ They are clearly derived from common ancestral proteins in the nicotinicoid superfamily.

The two subfamilies can be distinguished on the basis of their different channel properties, the availability of selective agonists, antagonists, and modulators, the different chromosomal localization of the genes coding for the protein subunits of the two subfamilies and the reluctance of these subunits to coexpress in functional receptors, and the different proteins that anchor the protein complexes to the cytoskeleton. A summary of these differences follows (Table 1), some aspects being covered in more detail in later sections.

2.1. Channel Properties. The mean channel open time for GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors is less than that of GABA<sub>C</sub>

receptors. GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor gated chloride channels desensitize more readily and are activated and closed more quickly than GABA<sub>C</sub> receptor gated chloride channels.<sup>26–28</sup>

### 2.2. Selective Agonists.
(+)-CAMP (2, 1S,2R-2-(aminomethyl)cyclopropanecarboxylic acid) is a selective agonist for GABA<sub>C</sub> receptors being inactive at GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors.<sup>29</sup> No equivalent selective GABA<sub>A</sub> agonist is yet known that does not also have a significant agonist/antagonist action at GABA<sub>C</sub> receptors. However, THIP (3, 4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo[4,5-c]pyridin-3-ol) and P4S (4, piperidine-4-sulfonic acid) are partial agonists at GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors and competitive antagonists at GABA<sub>C</sub> receptors.<sup>30</sup>

![Chemical Structures](chemical_structures.png)

### 2.3. Selective Antagonists.
Bicuculline (5) and TPMPA (6, (1,2,5,6-tetrahydropyridin-4-yl phosphinic acid) are selective competitive antagonists for GABA<sub>A</sub> and GABA<sub>C</sub> receptors, respectively. Bicuculline is some 5000 times more potent as an antagonist at GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors than at GABA<sub>C</sub> receptors,<sup>30</sup> while TPMPA is at least 100 times more potent as an antagonist at GABA<sub>C</sub> receptors than at GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors.<sup>31</sup> Some phosphinic acid analogues of GABA that are inactive at GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors (and agonists at GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors) are potent GABA<sub>C</sub> antagonists.<sup>30</sup>

![Chemical Structures](chemical_structures_2.png)

### 2.4. Modulators.
GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors are modulated by barbiturates, benzodiazepines, and neurosteroids,<sup>2</sup> whereas GABA<sub>C</sub> receptors are insensitive to these agents.<sup>12</sup>

### 2.5. Subunit Expression.
The protein subunits that can coexpress to make up recombinant GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors do not coexpress with any of the GABA<sub>C</sub> protein subunits to form functional heteromeric receptors. GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor protein subunits do not form functional homomeric receptors, whereas GABA<sub>C</sub> receptor protein subunits do. Distinct GABA<sub>A</sub> and GABA<sub>C</sub> receptor responses can be observed in the same native neurons<sup>27</sup> and in recombinant expression systems.<sup>30</sup>

### 2.6. Chromosomal Location of Coding Genes.
The genes coding for GABA<sub>A</sub> subunit proteins show αβγ/ε clustering on human chromosomes 1, 4, 5, 15, and X (see section 3.1), whereas the genes coding for GABA<sub>C</sub> subunit proteins ρ1 and ρ2 are found on human chromosome 6<sup>32–34</sup> and the gene for ρ3 is on human chromosome 3.<sup>35</sup>

### 2.7. Anchoring Proteins.
Different proteins, GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor-associated protein (GABARAP)<sup>36</sup> and microtubule-associated protein 1B (MAP-1B),<sup>37</sup> anchor GABA<sub>A</sub> and GABA<sub>C</sub> subunits respectively to the cytoskeleton.

### 2.8. IUPHAR Recommendations Regarding the Nomenclature of Subtypes of GABA<sub>A</sub> Receptors.
The International Union of Pharmacology (IUPHAR) has formed a Nomenclature Committee to attempt to rationalize the nomenclature of pharmacologically important receptors. Most of the receptor nomenclature reports thus far have been concerned with GPCRs. The IUPHAR report on GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors<sup>8</sup> was the first major report on LGICs. It was a task that the committee appeared to take on with some trepidation. They state that the 'combinatorial principle of receptor construction introduces a higher order of complexity. This complexity renders the recognition of the structures of receptor subtypes in their natural setting extremely difficult (in fact, at present, usually unattainable). Thus, it is not possible to construct a classification comparable with the comprehensive scheme for native receptor subtypes obtained in the previous articles of this series.' The IUPHAR committee notes that theirs is "a provisional version" of recommendations and recognizes "its limitations are considerable."

The proposals made by the IUPHAR committee largely address the issue of the wide variety of effects of benzodiazepines on GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors. The major criteria for their classification are the pharmacological effects of various benzodiazepines together with the protein subunit composition of recombinant receptors

that exhibit specific responses to benzodiazepines and related drugs. They identify six major types of benzodiazepine responses and thus recommend that the subtypes of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor should be designated as a series: GABA<sub>A1</sub>, GABA<sub>A2</sub>, GABA<sub>A3</sub>, GABA<sub>A4</sub>, GABA<sub>A5</sub>, and GABA<sub>A6</sub>. They then address the issue that not all GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors are influenced by benzodiazepines and propose that benzodiazepine-insensitive GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors be known as GABA<sub>A0</sub> receptors.

The IUPHAR committee noted the sequence similarities between GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor subunits and what are currently classified as GABA<sub>C</sub> receptor subunits and recommended that the latter be reclassified as benzodiazepine-insensitive GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors. Thus what are now widely referred to in the literature as GABA<sub>C</sub> receptors would be classified as GABA<sub>A0r</sub> receptors — 0 for benzodiazepine-insensitivity and r for being comprised of a ρ subunit. The justification for this appears to be solely the sequence similarities between the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor protein subunits and the GABA<sub>C</sub> receptor subunits as discussed above in section 2. They note that “selective antagonists have been the most powerful operational tools for discriminating subtypes in other receptor classes”; unfortunately they appear to have overlooked the discovery of TPMPA (6) as a selective GABA<sub>C</sub> receptor antagonist in 1996.<sup>38</sup>

GABA<sub>A</sub> and GABA<sub>C</sub> receptors are clearly distinguished on the basis of the selective antagonists bicuculline (5) and TPMPA (6) for GABA<sub>A</sub> and GABA<sub>C</sub> receptors, respectively. Furthermore, the IUPHAR classification minimizes the significance of the reluctance of GABA<sub>C</sub> receptor subunits to coexpress with GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor subunits in functional recombinant receptors, the clear evidence in the retina for functionally distinct native GABA<sub>A</sub> and GABA<sub>C</sub> receptors on the same neurons, and the substantial physiological and pharmacological differences between GABA<sub>A</sub> and GABA<sub>C</sub> receptors.

The IUPHAR classification as applied to benzodiazepine-sensitive, bicuculline-sensitive GABA-activated LGICs is a welcome initiative. However, we reject the inclusion of GABA<sub>C</sub> receptors in the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor classification as provisionally recommended by Barnard et al.<sup>8</sup> and prefer the classification on GABA<sub>A</sub> and GABA<sub>C</sub> receptors as distinct subfamilies of the family of GABA-activated LGICs (as used by Darlison and Albrecht,<sup>4</sup> Le Novère and Changeux,<sup>18</sup> and Bormann<sup>39</sup>).

We consider that the principles enunciated by Barnard et al.<sup>8</sup> for the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor subfamily could well be applied to the GABA<sub>C</sub> receptor subfamily as TPMPA-sensitive, bicuculline-insensitive GABA-activated LGICs being called GABA<sub>Cr1</sub>, GABA<sub>Cr2</sub>, or GABA<sub>Cr3</sub> receptors to designate them being composed of ρ1, ρ2, or ρ3 subunits.

## 3. GABA<sub>A</sub> Receptors

### 3.1. GABA<sub>A</sub> Receptor Subunits. GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors are considered heterooligomeric receptors. To date, at least 16 human GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor proteins have been described, and these have been classified under five distinct subfamilies of protein subunits termed α, β, γ, δ, and ε. There are six α subunits, four β subunits with two splice variants, three γ subunits with two splice variants, one δ subunit, and one ε subunit.<sup>2,21,40</sup> Recently

a θ subunit has been described.<sup>41</sup> There is approximately 30% sequence identity between the subunit classes and approximately 70% sequence identity between subunit subtypes. If all possible combinations of isoforms containing 2α, 2β, and one other class were represented in native pentameric GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, then more than 2000 different GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors could exist in vivo.<sup>2</sup> Barnard et al.<sup>8</sup> suggested a maximum of the order of 800 combinations. It is quite unlikely that these extraordinary numbers of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor subtypes exist in vivo; however, a significant number do exist that can be differentiated pharmacologically as well as by subunit composition.

McKernan and Whiting<sup>42</sup> concluded that the number of major subtypes of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors was probably less than 10, with the α1β2γ2 subtype accounting for 43%, α2β2/βγ2 18%, and α3βnγ2/γ3 17% on the basis of immunoprecipitation studies, but this has been challenged by Sigel and Kannenberg<sup>43</sup> in that receptor subtypes that are difficult to solubilize, e.g., anchored receptors, are under-represented in immunoprecipitation studies. Barnard et al.<sup>8</sup> discuss the difficulties of a variety of methods for determining GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor subtypes in situ, while Darlison and Albrecht<sup>4</sup> address the issue of “GABA<sub>A</sub> Receptor Subtypes: Which, Where and Why?” Subunit mutant and receptor gene knockout animals can provide evidence of the importance of particular subunits of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors.<sup>44–46</sup> Clearly, the availability of a range of subunit-specific drugs would greatly aid in our understanding of the relative importance of the various GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor subunit proteins and their preferred combinations.

#### 3.2. Structural Diversity of Chemicals Acting on GABA<sub>A</sub> Receptors. Johnston<sup>2</sup> proposed that there were at least 11 different structurally specific sites on GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors. The 11 sites were (1) agonist sites, which also recognize competitive antagonists; (2) picrotoxin sites, which also interact with γ-butyrolactones, caprolactams, and some insecticides; (3) sedative-hypnotic barbiturate sites; (4) neuroactive steroid sites; (5) benzodiazepine sites; (6) ethanol sites; (7) stereoselective sites for inhalation anesthetics; (8) furosemide sites; (9) sites for Zn<sup>2+</sup> ions; (10) sites for other divalent cations; and (11) sites for La<sup>3+</sup> ions. In addition, 3 other possible sites were noted: (a) phospholipid sites; (b) phosphorylation sites involving specific protein kinase activities; and (c) sites involved in the interaction of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors and microtubules that may anchor receptor clusters at postsynaptic membranes. Furthermore, it was clear that several of the proposed sites, e.g., the benzodiazepine and steroid sites, could be further subdivided.

The structural diversity of chemicals acting on GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors suggests that these receptors do indeed have a large number of sites that recognize specific chemical patterns. Some of the sites may be associated with specific protein subunits; e.g., the diuretic furosemide (7) appears to act on sites specifically associated with α6 subunits<sup>47</sup> — indeed an important medicinal chemistry target is the discovery of subunit-specific agents. Studies on chimeric α1 and α6 subunits and site-directed mutagenesis of these and β2/β subunits indicate that particular amino acid residues in transmembrane

domains 1 and 2 are important in the specificity of the GABA receptor antagonist action of furosemide.⁴⁸

![Furosemide](https://i.imgur.com/1.png)

There has been significant recent interest in a number of structural classes of chemicals that influence GABA<sub>A</sub> function. These include endogenous substances found in vertebrates, natural products found in herbal preparations, and new chemical entities.

### 3.2.1. Oleamide and Related Fatty Acid Derivatives.
The brain lipid, oleamide (8) (Z-9-octadecenamide), accumulates in the CSF of sleep-derived cats suggesting that it may be an endogenous sleep-inducing factor. Oleamide enhanced the effects of GABA on rat cultured cortical neurons with an EC<sub>50</sub> of 15 μM.⁴⁹ In studies on recombinant GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors expressed in Xenopus oocytes, oleamide enhanced the effects of GABA only on benzodiazepine-sensitive receptors containing a γ2 subunit, but its enhancing action was not sensitive to the specific benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil.⁴⁹,⁵⁰ Oleamide and related compounds are being intensively investigated for use in sleep therapy.

![Oleamide (Z-9-octadecenamide)](https://i.imgur.com/2.png)

Oleic acid does not directly influence GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor function, nor does the endogenous cannabinoid anandamide (N-arachidonylethanolamide).⁵¹

Docosahexaenoic acid (9) has complex effects of recombinant GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, accelerating desensitization at 0.1 μM, enhancing peak amplitude at 1 μM, and gradually suppressing peak amplitude at 3 μM. Oleic acid had no effect, while arachidonic acid mimicked the effect of docosahexaenoic acid.⁵² 13-L-Hydroxylinoleic acid and a variety of food additives enhanced the action of GABA on recombinant GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors.⁵³

![Docosahexaenoic acid](https://i.imgur.com/3.png)

The arachidonic acid metabolite, thromboxane A₂ (10), and several analogues inhibit the action of GABA on GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors.⁵⁴

### 3.2.2. Thyroid Hormones.
Thyroid hormones antagonize GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor function. The most potent is L-triiodothyronine (11), a noncompetitive inhibitor with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 7 μM.⁵⁵ Studies on recombinant GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors show that the effect requires only α1 and β2 subunits and that it was not blocked by the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil. This work suggests a nongenomic action of thyroid hormones, which are known to be released from nerve terminals, on GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors.

![Thromboxane A₂](https://i.imgur.com/4.png)
![Triiodothyronine](https://i.imgur.com/5.png)

L-Triiodothyronine also had a direct channel-gating action (EC<sub>50</sub> 23 μM) that was blocked by picrotoxin but insensitive to bicuculline.

### 3.2.3. Peptides and Proteins.
The peptide hormone, somatostatin-14, and GABA are known to be colocalized in some CNS neurons and to modulate reciprocally each other's release. Studies on TBPS binding to GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors indicate that somatostatin interacts with these receptors in the micromolar range,⁵⁶ but functional studies on GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors have yet to be reported.

Waglerin-1, a 22-amino acid peptide purified from the venom of Wagler's pit viper, modulated the action of GABA on hypothalamic neurons.⁵⁷ It enhanced the action of GABA on 78 and suppressed on 44 of 141 neurons examined. The potentiation could be blocked by the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil. The suppression was competitive and positively correlated with inhibition of GABA responses by Zn²⁺ ions, suggestive that waglerin-1 is a competitive antagonist of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors that lack γ subunits. This suggests that waglerin has subunit-specific actions on GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, acting as a benzodiazepine-like positive modulator on some receptors and as a competitive antagonist on other receptors.

Amyloid-β protein is the major component of the amyloid deposition that characterizes Alzheimer's disease. Studies on *Aplysia* neurons have shown that amyloid-β fragments 1–40 and 25–35, but not 1–16, inhibit GABA-activated responses, indicating that this activity resides in amino acid residues 17–40 of amyloid-β.⁵⁸ Studies on mammalian GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors have yet to be reported.

Insulin promotes the rapid translocation of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors from the intracellular compartment to the plasma membrane in transfected HEK cells.⁵⁹ This requires the presence of the β2 subunit. In CNS neurons, insulin increases the expression of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors on postsynaptic and dendritic membranes.

A new cellular protein, GABARAP, that links GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors via γ2 subunits to the cytoskeleton has been identified.³⁶ GABARAP binds to GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors in vitro and in vivo. Its highly positive charged N-terminus features a putative tubulin-binding motif suggesting a mechanism for the targeting and clustering of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors at synapses.

The microtubule depolymerizing agent, colchicine, is a competitive antagonist of recombinant $\alpha 1 \beta 2 \gamma 2 L$ GABA${}_{A}$ receptors expressed in *Xenopus* oocytes. ${}^{60}$ Other depolymerizing agents, such as nocodazole and vinblastine, did not influence these GABA${}_{A}$ receptors, and the polymerizing agent, taxol, did not affect colchicine inhibition of GABA responses.

### 3.2.4. Nitric Oxide and Nitrous Oxide
The diffusible endogenous factor, nitric oxide, directly influences recombinant GABA${}_{A}$ receptor function. It acted as a GABA antagonist on $\alpha 1 \beta 2 \gamma 2 s$ receptors, while on $\alpha 1 \beta 2$ receptors it was inactive at low concentrations and enhanced GABA action at high concentrations. ${}^{61}$ Nitric oxide also has indirect actions on GABA${}_{A}$ receptors acting via protein kinase G and A. ${}^{62}$

The gaseous anesthetic, nitrous oxide, enhances the action of GABA on GABA${}_{A}$ receptors in a manner similar to other anesthetic agents. ${}^{63}$

### 3.2.5. Flavonoids
Neuroactive flavonoids have been described as a new family of benzodiazepine receptor ligands. ${}^{64,65}$ Flavonoids isolated from plants used in traditional medicine as tranquilizers have specific actions on the benzodiazepine sites of GABA${}_{A}$ receptors. Unlike the benzodiazepines, they have anxiolytic effects not associated with myorelaxant, sedative, or amnesic actions. Combinatorial chemistry has yielded synthetic flavonoids such as 6,3'-dinitroflavone and 6-bromo-3'-nitroflavone (12) that have high affinity ($K_{i}$ 1.5–30 nM) for GABA${}_{A}$ receptors. ${}^{65}$ SAR studies on recombinant GABA${}_{A}$ receptors indicate that 6-methylflavone is a benzodiazepine antagonist. ${}^{66}$ Molecular modeling analysis of 3'- and 4'-substituted flavones has allowed further development of a comprehensive pharmacophore model of the interaction of benzodiazepines and related compounds with GABA${}_{A}$ receptors. ${}^{67}$

(12) 6-Bromo-3'-nitroflavone

The isoflavones, genistein (13) and daidzein (14), have been shown to directly inhibit the action of GABA on recombinant GABA${}_{A}$ receptors; this action is independent of the well-known tyrosine kinase inhibitory action of genistein (13), since daidzein (14) is not a tyrosine kinase inhibitor. ${}^{68}$

### 3.2.6. Terpenoids
A range of terpenoids are known to modulate GABA${}_{A}$ receptors. Miltirone (15) is the most potent of a series of diterpene quinolones from the Chinese medicinal herb *Salvia miltriorrhiza* that positively modulate GABA${}_{A}$ receptors. ${}^{69}$ Quantitative structure–activity relationship (QSAR) studies have been carried out on 28 picrotoxane terpenoids, including picrodendrin, that noncompetitively block rat brain GABA${}_{A}$ receptors, to reveal significant differences between the ionotropic GABA receptors in rat brain and houseflies. ${}^{70}$ 12,14-Dichlorodehydroabietic acid (16), a fish toxin which is produced from the diterpene carboxylic acid dehydroabietic acid in the bleaching of wood pulp, is a potent noncompetitive antagonist of GABA${}_{A}$ receptors. ${}^{71}$

### 3.2.7. Miscellaneous Therapeutic Agents
A variety of therapeutic agents known for their effects on other receptors also have actions on GABA${}_{A}$ receptors. These actions on GABA${}_{A}$ receptors may contribute to side effects of the therapeutic agents and provide structural leads for the development of more specific agents.

The GABA${}_{A}$ receptor antagonist action ($IC_{50}$ 127 $\mu$M) of cocaine (17) may contribute to cocaine-induced seizures. ${}^{72}$ Clozapine (18) and some other antipsychotic drugs may preferentially block the same subset of GABA${}_{A}$ receptors. ${}^{73}$ The dehydro derivative of the antidepressant, pirilindole, is a GABA${}_{A}$ receptor antagonist ($EC_{50}$ 12 $\mu$M). ${}^{74}$

(17) Cocaine  
(18) Clozapine  

The 5-HT${}_{3}$ receptor antagonist, ondansetron (19), is a noncompetitive antagonist ($IC_{50}$ 10 $\mu$M) of GABA${}_{A}$ receptors; this action may be the basis of ondansetron-induced seizures. ${}^{75}$

(19) Ondansetron  
(20) Ciprofloxacin  

Quinolone antibacterial agents, such as ciprofloxacin (20), that have convulsant side effects are GABA${}_{A}$ receptor antagonists; the increased incidence of convulsions induced by these quinolones administered concomitantly with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories, such

as felbinac, is consistent with such anti-inflammatories potentiating the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor antagonist action of the quinolones.<sup>76,77</sup>

bis(7)-Tacrine (1,7-N,N′-heptylenebis(9,9′-amino-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroacridine)) (21) is a potential Alzheimer's disease drug on the basis of its superior acetylcholinesterase inhibition and memory-enhancing potency relative to tacrine. It is a competitive GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor antagonist (IC<sub>50</sub> 6 μM), some 18 times more potent than tacrine on these receptors.<sup>78</sup>

### 3.3. Benzodiazepines and Related Compounds as Allosteric Modulators of a Subset of GABA<sub>A</sub> Receptors.

The discovery in 1975 that the therapeutic effects of the then most widely prescribed of all drugs, the benzodiazepines, were related to modulation of GABA receptors<sup>79,80</sup> continues to have a profound influence on the study of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors. A range of diverse chemicals have been found to interact with what became known as benzodiazepine receptors, including diazepam (22), flumazenil (23), some β-carbolines (25–27), and γ-butyrolactones (28–30). New concepts about receptor modulation were realized ('inverse agonists', positive and negative modulators) and new generations of drugs developed (e.g., the imidazopyridine, zolpidem (31)).

GABA receptors became known as GABA/Bz receptors, and subtypes of these receptors were described (BZ<sub>1</sub> and BZ<sub>2</sub>). These terms should no longer be used as we now know that (a) benzodiazepines act on many other receptors unrelated to GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, (b) benzodiazepines interact with only one of several regulatory sites on GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, and (c) GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors exist that are insensitive to modulation by benzodiazepines.<sup>8</sup>

Benzodiazepines have no direct action on mammalian GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors. They act to enhance the action of GABA by increasing the frequency of GABA-activated channel openings<sup>81</sup> and by increasing channel conductance.<sup>82</sup> The discovery of agents, such as 6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-β-carboline-3-carboxylate (27, DMCM), that decreased the action of GABA on GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors led to the concept of benzodiazepine 'inverse agonists'.<sup>83</sup> Interestingly, DMCM (27) was initially described as having 'negative efficacy' at benzodiazepine receptors<sup>84</sup> — this is a more accurate terminology than 'inverse agonist' as strictly benzodiazepines are allosteric modulators of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors rather than agonists or 'inverse agonists'. True inverse agonists have been described in constitutively active G-protein coupled receptors, such as β2-adrenoceptors.<sup>85</sup>

Puia et al.<sup>86</sup> introduced the terms 'positive allosteric modulator' and 'negative allosteric modulator' to accurately describe what are commonly but incorrectly described as 'agonists' and 'inverse agonists' when referring to the actions of benzodiazepines on GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors. Johnston<sup>2</sup> introduced the term 'neutralizing allosteric modulator' for benzodiazepine 'antagonists', such as flumazenil (23, Ro15-1788). The term 'allosteric' is justified on the basis of GABA agonists and competitive antagonists binding to GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors at sites different from those that bind benzodiazepines and related modulators. The classification of these modulatory actions should be made on the basis of functional assays in which the concentrations of agonists and modulators are systematically varied. This enables the relative potencies and efficacies of positive and negative allosteric modulators to be established and thus to classify some modulators as, e.g., partial positive allosteric modulators, if their maximal modulation of agonist responses is less than that of other modulators.

The effects of benzodiazepines on GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors are complexly dependent on subunit composition as excellently reviewed by Barnard et al.<sup>8</sup> In general, the γ2 subunit is required for the most widely observed effects of benzodiazepines on native GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, consistent with γ2 subunits being much more abundant in brain than γ1 and γ3 subunits. Positive allosteric modulation is reduced when γ2 is replaced by γ1 or γ3 in recombinant GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors and negative allosteric modulators become positive allosteric modulators.<sup>86,87</sup> In addition, flumazenil (23) changes from a neutralizing allosteric modulator to a positive allosteric modulator when γ2 is replaced by γ1.<sup>88</sup> If γ is replaced by δ or ε, the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors are insensitive to benzodiazepines.<sup>89–91</sup>

The importance of the γ2 subunit in GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors for benzodiazepine effects is demonstrated by transgenic mice that lack the gene coding for γ2 subunits and whose GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors are insensitive to benzodiazepines.<sup>92</sup> A single amino acid on the γ2 subunit has a profound influence on the effects of the benzodiazepines.<sup>93</sup> Mutating threonine 142 to serine changes the action of flumazenil from a neutralizing to a positive allosteric modulator and doubles the potencies of diazepam (22), flunitrazepam, and clonazepam as positive allosteric modulators, whereas responses to zolpidem (31) and alpidem are halved by this mutation. The agonist effects of GABA and the modulatory effects of barbiturates and neurosteroids were not influenced by this mutation. The nature of the α subunit in GABA<sub>A</sub>

receptors also has a major influence on benzodiazepine action (see Barnard et al.⁸), whereas the β subunit has little influence.⁹⁴

(31) Zolpidem

The development of subunit-specific modulators of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors is an important medicinal chemistry target with the objective of discovering better therapeutic agents that do not have either the unwanted side effects or the full range of therapeutic actions of the traditional benzodiazepines. These side effects include dependence, potentiation of the effects of ethanol, mild ataxia, and mild amnesia. Agents selective for one of the four major therapeutic actions of benzodiazepines, i.e., anxiolytic, sedative-hypnotic, anticonvulsant, and muscle-relaxant actions, are much sought after. The widely prescribed sedative-hypnotic drug, zolpidem (31), is an imidazopyridine that has only minor anxiolytic, muscle relaxant, and anticonvulsant properties and may bind selectively to some benzodiazepine sites on particular GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor subtypes,⁹⁵,⁹⁶ though its amnesic side effects appear to be similar to those of traditional benzodiazepines.⁹⁷

There have been many extensive QSAR studies on benzodiazepines and related compounds using activity data generated from studies on what we now know to be mixed populations of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors.⁹⁸⁻¹⁰⁰ Some recent studies have used activity data using recombinant GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors of known subunit composition. Thus, Huang et al.¹⁰¹ measured the binding affinities for a series of imidazobenzodiazepines at five different GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors and carried out QSAR studies using comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA). Jacobsen et al.¹⁰² carried out binding and functional studies on a series of 61 piperazine imidazo[1,5-α]quinoxaline ureas on α1β2γ2 recombinant GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors to develop two urea-based compounds (32, 33) that were partial positive allosteric modulators with good anxiolytic properties and minimal benzodiazepine-type side effects.

3.4. Steroid Modulation of GABA<sub>A</sub> Receptors. Neuroactive steroids are potent, selective allosteric modulators of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors. These steroids include neurosteroids that are synthesized in the brain and may serve as endogenous anxiolytic and analgesic agents, steroids such as corticosteroids that are produced elsewhere in the body, and a variety of synthetic steroids. Studies on recombinant GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors provide evidence for a subunit-selective heterogeneity of steroid sensitivity,¹⁰³,¹⁰⁴ although steroid modulation appears to be a general property of most GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors unlike benzodiazepine modulation.² Neuroactive steroids also modulate NMDA receptors¹⁰⁵ and calcium channels associated with G-protein receptors.¹⁰⁶

Neurosteroids synthesized in the brain and neuroactive steroids imported into the brain from the periphery represent important endogenous agents for influencing brain function by modulating the activation of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors.¹⁰⁷ They include pregnenolone (34, PREG), dehydroepiandrosterone (35, DHEA), their sulfates, and their reduced metabolites such as 3α,21-dihydroxy-5α-pregnan-20-one (36, α-THDOC). The brain levels of α-THDOC (36), among the most potent known steroid modulators of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, increase during stress; this increase is prevented by adrenalectomy indicating that the adrenals are the source of α-THDOC.¹⁰⁸ The adrenal steroids, hydrocortisone (37, cortisol) and cortisone, are also potent modulators of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors.¹⁰⁹,¹¹⁰

Steroid modulation of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors is enantioselective indicating that steroids act at specific sites on GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors rather than via nonenantioselective interactions with membrane lipids.¹¹¹ Nilsson et al.,¹¹² however, found that this was not true for all steroids, observing enantioselectivity for DHEA (35) but not for pregnenolone sulfate or 3α,5β-3-hydroxypregnan-20-one sulfate. Some evidence has been produced to indicate that the neuroactive steroids might modulate GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors via the picrotoxinin site in the chloride channel,¹¹³ but studies on mutant GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors that are insensitive to picrotoxinin show that PREG sulfate and DHEA sulfate do not require a functional picrotoxinin site to modulate GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors.¹¹⁴ Although many of the actions of neuroactive steroids are similar to those of barbiturates on GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, steroids and barbiturates interact with different sites on GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors.

tors. \({ }^{115}\) Neuroactive steroids appear to modulate GABA \(_{\mathrm{A}}\) receptors only from the extracellular domain, being inactive on intracellular administration. \({ }^{116}\)

Synthetic steroids that modulate GABA \(_{\mathrm{A}}\) receptors show promise as therapeutic agents. The steroid anesthetic alfaxolone (38, 3α-hydroxy-5α-dihydopregnane-11,20-dione) is no longer used in human medicine but has provided a lead for the development of new steroid derivatives. Thus, CCD-3693, an orally active analogue of pregnanolone, shows promise as a sedative–hypnotic agent; \({ }^{117}\) some water-soluble \(2 \beta\)-morpholinyl steroids (e.g., 39) are intravenous anesthetic agents, \({ }^{118}\) and the steroid analogue, ganaxolone (40), is an orally active anticonvulsant. \({ }^{119}\)

![Chemical Structures](https://i.imgur.com/chemical_structures.png)

Anabolic steroids used to enhance sporting performance are known to modulate GABA \(_{\mathrm{A}}\) receptors. The steroids include DHEA (35, an endogenous steroid whose use is permitted in major league baseball but is banned in many other sports) and stanozolol (41). \({ }^{113,120}\)

Many neuroactive steroids have bidirectional activity on GABA \(_{\mathrm{A}}\) receptors, acting as positive allosteric modulators at low concentrations and as negative allosteric modulators at higher concentrations (e.g., PREG and its sulfate \({ }^{121}\) ). Epipregnanolone (3β-hydroxy-5β-pregnane-20-one) is able to block the positive modulating action of neuroactive steroids suggesting that the bidirectional activity results from interactions with more than one class of modulatory site for steroids on GABA \(_{\mathrm{A}}\) receptors. \({ }^{122,123}\) This is supported by the opposing effects of some 3α-hydroxy (positive modulation) and 3β-hydroxy (negative modulation) steroids. \({ }^{124}\) Steroid partial positive modulators ('partial agonists'), such as 3α,21-dihydroxy-5β-pregnane-20-one, have been noted. \({ }^{125}\)

## 4. GABA \(_{\mathrm{C}}\) Receptors

### 4.1. GABA \(_{\mathrm{C}}\) Receptor Subunits
GABA \(_{\mathrm{C}}\) receptors are considered to be both homooligomeric and pseudo-heterooligomeric receptors comprised of \(\rho\) subunits. To date, up to five different \(\rho\) subunits have been cloned, including two from human retinal cDNA library (\(\rho 1\) and \(\rho 2)^{32,126}\) with two \(\rho 1\) splice variants, \({ }^{127}\) three from rat (\(\rho 1-3)^{128-131}\) two from chick (\(\rho 1\) and \(\rho 2)^{132}\) five from white perch (\(\rho 1-5)^{133}\) and two from mouse (\(\rho 1\) and \(\rho 2)^{134}\) retinae. These subunits are often referred to as GABA \(_{\mathrm{A}}\) receptor subunits because they show 30–40% sequence identity with other GABA \(_{\mathrm{A}}\) receptor subunits. \({ }^{21}\) This level of subunit similarity is comparable with GABA \(_{\mathrm{A}}\) receptor subunits; however, it is also comparable with other LGIC subunits such as glycine and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunits. The \(\rho\) subunits have approximately 60–70% sequence identity between each other \({ }^{32,130,135,136}\) and have between 85% and 99% sequence identity among species.

### 4.2. Composition of GABA \(_{\mathrm{C}}\) Receptors
\(\rho\) Subunits do not coassemble with the classical GABA \(_{\mathrm{A}}\) receptor subunits. Coexpression of \(\rho\) subunits with the GABA \(_{\mathrm{A}}\) receptor subunits \(\alpha 1\), \(\beta 2\), and \(\gamma 2\) expressed in Xenopus oocytes and with the \(\beta\) subunit of the glycine receptor in HEK 293 cells showed no detectable alterations in whole cell currents. \({ }^{14}\) Furthermore, coimmunoprecipitation experiments using human \(\rho 1\) and \(\rho 2\) subunits with \(\alpha 1\), \(\alpha 5\), and \(\beta 1\) GABA \(_{\mathrm{A}}\) receptor subunits showed no interaction between these subunits in vitro. \({ }^{137}\) Thus, \(\rho\) subunits do not combine with the classical GABA \(_{\mathrm{A}}\) receptor subunits. It has been shown that the N-terminal region of the subunits directs the assembly of either \(\rho\) or GABA \(_{\mathrm{A}}\) receptor subunits into homooligomeric GABA \(_{\mathrm{C}}\) and heterooligomeric GABA \(_{\mathrm{A}}\) receptors. \({ }^{137}\) Thus, GABA \(_{\mathrm{C}}\) receptors are physically and functionally different from GABA \(_{\mathrm{A}}\) or glycine receptor subunits.

The human \(\rho 1\) and \(\rho 2\) subunits form homooligomeric receptors when expressed in oocytes, with different physiological yet similar pharmacological properties. Whole cell currents generated by human \(\rho 2\) receptors are an order of magnitude lower than currents generated by \(\rho 1\) receptors, \({ }^{136,138}\) yet they have a pharmacological profile similar to that of expressed \(\rho 1\) receptors. This suggests that the amino acid residues important for most aspects of GABA receptor agonist action may not be among those that differ between \(\rho 1\) and \(\rho 2\) subunits, including the 20% amino acid difference in the N-terminal region. \({ }^{135}\) Chimera constructs between human \(\rho 1\) and \(\rho 2\) subunits have shown that the N-terminus of the \(\rho 1\) subunit contains subunit assembly signals that aid \(\rho 1\) subunits to form more efficient homooligomeric receptors than \(\rho 2\) subunits. \({ }^{139,140}\)

Even though there is high sequence identity between the rat and human \(\rho 2\) subunits, the rat \(\rho 2\) subunit does not appear to form homooligomeric receptors when expressed in Xenopus oocytes. However, it can assemble with the rat \(\rho 1\) subunit to form pseudoheterooligomeric receptors in oocytes, with similar pharmacology to native GABA \(_{\mathrm{C}}\) receptors in the rat retina. \({ }^{128}\) The rat \(\rho 3\) subunit forms both homooligomeric \({ }^{141}\) as well as pseudo-heterooligomeric receptors by assembling with other \(\rho\) subunits. The increasing evidence that rat and human \(\rho 1\) and \(\rho 2\) subunits, as well as rat \(\rho 3\) subunits, combine to form pseudoheterooligomeric receptors \({ }^{128,142}\) with physical properties distinct from homooligomeric receptors indicates that GABA \(_{\mathrm{C}}\) receptors are heterogeneous in vivo.

### 4.3. Site-Directed Mutagenesis Studies on GABA \(_{\mathrm{C}}\) Receptors
Site-directed mutagenesis studies have been used to study the structure–function of \(\rho 1\) GABA \(_{\mathrm{C}}\) receptors. The \(\beta 2\) GABA \(_{\mathrm{A}}\) receptor subunit has been shown to have the highest sequence identity with the

Perspective

ρ1 GABAC receptor subunit (approximately 50%). Thus, much of the site-directed mutagenesis studies of ρ1 GABAC receptors have been directed at comparisons with similar studies on the β2 GABAA receptor subunit.²⁸ Five amino acid residues (Y198, Y200, Y241, T244, and Y247), located between the N-terminal extracellular cysteine loop and the first transmembrane spanning domain, were shown to be involved in GABA-mediated activation at homooligomeric ρ1 GABAC receptors.²⁸ The amino acid residues were conservatively mutated, and these mutations significantly impaired GABA-mediated activation. These residues were grouped in two domains that corresponded in position to the putative agonist-binding domains previously identified for the β2 subunit of the α1β2γ2 GABA channels. Y198, T244, and Y247 correspond directly with the amino acid residues identified for GABA activation in the β2 subunit, while Y200 and Y241 do not.²⁸ The latter residues correspond to important residues identified for glycine receptor activation.

A single amino acid residue in the M2 region which corresponds to threonine 314 (T314) has been shown to confer picrotoxinin sensitivity to rat ρ1 GABAC receptors expressed in Xenopus oocytes.¹²⁸ GABAC receptors in the rat retina are insensitive to picrotoxinin, while ρ1 GABAC receptors, expressed in Xenopus oocytes, are sensitive to picrotoxinin. However, coexpressing ρ1 and ρ2 subunits in oocytes produces a novel GABA receptor with similar pharmacology to native GABAC receptors in the rat retina indicating that pseudoheterooligomeric GABAC receptors may exist in vivo. Mutation of T314 to a methionine on the ρ1 subunit resulted in a receptor that was insensitive to picrotoxinin.

GABAA receptors containing a β subunit are potentiated by the presence of low concentrations of barbiturate anesthetics, while GABAC receptors are not. Chimeric constructs using β2 and ρ1 subunits were made to identify the region(s) of the β subunit that confers barbiturate sensitivity, and these were found to be located on the M3 domain. Further studies using site-directed mutagenesis identified a single amino acid residue, tryptophan 328 (W328), which is located on the M3 domain to confer barbiturate sensitivity of the ρ1 subunit when replaced by a hydrophobic residue.¹⁴³,¹⁴⁴

### 4.4. Channel Properties of GABAC Receptors.
GABAC receptors differ from GABAA receptors in many significant ways. GABAC receptors are more sensitive than GABAA receptors to GABA. In studies using single-channel electrophysiological recordings with outside-out patches from rat retinal bipolar cells, GABAC receptors conducted less current and were 7 times more sensitive to GABA receptors than GABAA receptors (at GABAC receptors, EC₅₀ 4 μM; at GABAA receptors, EC₅₀ 27 μM).²⁶ The mean channel open time for GABAC receptors in bipolar cells is approximately 5 times longer than for GABAA receptors.²⁶ GABAC receptors have slower activation times. They do not readily desensitize with maintained GABA application and have slower closing times than GABAA receptors consisting of α1, β2, and γ2 subunits expressed in Xenopus oocytes.²⁸

### 4.5. Distribution of GABAC Receptor Subunits.
The use of reverse transcriptase PCR, Northern blot, and in situ hybridization techniques has shown that rat ρ1 and ρ2 mRNAs are located predominantly in the

Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, 2000, Vol. 43, No. 8 1437

retina. However, rat ρ2 mRNA is also found in most brain areas.¹⁴⁵–¹⁵¹ The ρ3 mRNA expression pattern is different from the expression pattern of ρ1 and ρ2 mRNAs in rat brain. ρ3 mRNA has lower expression levels in the retina and stronger expression levels in the hippocampus.¹⁵⁰ RT-PCR and in situ hybridization have also been used to determine the expression patterns of ρ1 and ρ2 subunits in the brains of 1-day-old chicks.¹³²,¹⁵² Transcripts were present in the cerebellum, optic tectum, epithalamus, and nucleus pretectalis. Furthermore, mRNA patterns show that the genes expressing ρ1 and ρ2 subunit exist on different populations of cells.¹⁵² RT-PCR showed that human ρ subunits are heterogeneously expressed in the CNS. Whereas the ρ1 subunit is confined mainly to the retina, the ρ2 subunit is present in all brain regions tested, including the cerebellum, thalamus, and temporal and frontal cortices.¹⁴²

Immunohistochemical studies have shown that ρ subunits are localized to rod bipolar cell axons where the GABAergic amacrine cells form synapses in the rat retina.¹⁴,¹⁶,¹⁴⁵–¹⁴⁷,¹⁴⁹,¹⁵³ Clusters of these subunits have been shown to occur on postsynaptic sites. Many other receptor subunits including GABAA and glycine receptor subunits are also found on rod bipolar cell axons; however, these do not colocalize with ρ subunits.¹⁴⁹ The distribution of GABAC receptors in the retina and in other parts of the visual pathway indicates that these receptors are involved in the temporal processing of visual information.¹⁵⁴,¹⁵⁵

### 4.6. Compounds Acting on GABAC Receptors.
The initial studies on GABA receptor classification began when the naturally occurring alkaloid, bicuculline (5), and its derivative, bicuculline methochloride, were shown to block the inhibitory actions of GABA in the spinal cord.¹⁵⁶–¹⁶⁰ By 1981, it had been shown that baclofen (42), a lipophilic analogue of GABA that crosses the blood-brain barrier, had similar agonist effects as GABA in the CNS. However, these effects could not be blocked by bicuculline (5). Thus, evidence was emerging that GABA receptors were heterogeneous and that not all GABA receptors were antagonized by bicuculline (5). The GABAA/GABAB classification was developed to distinguish GABA receptors that were (a) inhibited by bicuculline and insensitive to baclofen (42) and (b) activated by baclofen (42) and insensitive to bicuculline (5). These bicuculline-resistant receptors were classified as GABAB receptors and the original bicuculline-sensitive receptors were termed GABAA receptors.

At this time, a series of conformationally restricted analogues of GABA, which included CACA (43, cis-4-aminocrotonic acid) and TACA (44, trans-4-aminocrotonic acid), were tested for their depressant effects on GABA receptors located on spinal interneurons of the cat under pentobarbitone anesthesia.¹⁶⁰ CACA and TACA were designed to reduce the number of conformations that GABA can attain in order to identify which conformations bind to GABA receptors in the spinal cord. CACA (43) is a conformationally restricted analogue of GABA held in a folded conformation, while TACA (44) is a conformationally restricted analogue of GABA held in the extended conformation. It was shown that the depressant effect of TACA (44) but not CACA (43) was inhibited by bicuculline methochloride.¹⁶⁰

CACA (43) continued to depress the firing of spinal interneurons in the presence of bicuculline methochloride. Furthermore, the glycine receptor antagonist, strychnine, did not inhibit the depressant effect of CACA. Thus, CACA had no effect on glycine receptors in the spinal cord.¹⁶⁰ Andrews and Johnston¹⁶¹ therefore postulated that folded conformations of GABA activated a population of GABA receptors that were insensitive to bicuculline and extended conformations of GABA activated GABA receptors that were sensitive to bicuculline. CACA (43) was also shown to depress the firing of Renshaw cells in the cat spinal cord, yet baclofen (42) had relatively little effect on these cells. It seemed likely, therefore, that CACA (43) and baclofen (42) acted at different receptors. In addition to CACA and baclofen, several other conformationally restricted analogues of GABA have been shown to have bicuculline-insensitive depressant actions in the spinal cord. These include (±)-CAMP ((±)-cis-2-(aminomethyl)cyclopropanecarboxylic acid),¹⁶² T2ACHC (trans-2-aminocyclohexanecarboxylic acid),¹⁶³ and T3ACHC (trans-3-aminocyclohexanecarboxylic acid).¹⁶³

![Chemical Structures](https://i.imgur.com/1234567.png)

Both CACA and (±)-CAMP failed to displace the binding of \[^{3}H\]baclofen to rat cerebellar membranes.¹⁶⁴ On the basis of these results, the existence of a class of bicuculline-insensitive binding sites for GABA that are insensitive to baclofen was proposed, and these sites could be termed GABAC receptors.¹⁶⁴ For some time, the GABAC receptor classification was not accepted and the term non-A non-B was used instead to describe bicuculline-insensitive, baclofen-insensitive receptor sites.¹⁶⁵ However, studies of the effects of CACA in a variety of neuronal preparations link CACA to receptors that are activated by GABA and are distinct from the classical GABAA and GABAB receptors.²⁷,³⁰,¹⁶⁶,¹⁶⁷ Thus, popularity of classifying these receptors as GABAC receptors has grown.

Expression of poly(A)\(^+\) RNA from mammalian retinal injected into Xenopus oocytes generated two pharmacologically distinct GABA receptors, consisting of a bicuculline-sensitive component (GABAA component) and a bicuculline-insensitive and baclofen-insensitive component (GABAC component).³⁰ The GABAA component was blocked by bicuculline, and the remaining

current (GABAC component) was used to determine a structure–activity profile. The most potent GABAC receptor agonists in this study were found to be TACA (44, \(K_{D}\) 0.6 μM) and GABA (\(K_{D}\) 1.7 μM),³⁰ while CACA (43) was shown to be a moderately potent, selective partial agonist.³⁰

GABAC receptors were detected electrophysiologically in rod bipolar cells from rat retina. These receptors were insensitive to bicuculline (5) and baclofen (42) but were activated by CACA (43) after coapplication of GABA (1) with 100 μM bicuculline (5) to abolish the GABAA component.²⁷ It was found that GABAC receptors were more sensitive to GABA and the channel opened for longer periods with maintained agonist application, compared to GABAA receptors.²⁶

GABAC receptors were also detected in white perch retina on rod-driven horizontal cells (H4) but not bipolar cells, which were shown to contain GABAA receptors.¹⁶⁷ Differences between the two receptor types were detected by applying GABA to both types of cells. First, the bipolar cells showed rapid desensitization, while at rod-driven horizontal cells desensitization was not observed.¹⁶⁷ Further studies showed that GABAC receptors were found on cone-driven but not rod-driven horizontal cells isolated from catfish retinæ¹⁶⁸ as well as in bass retinal bipolar cells.¹⁶⁹ GABA receptors on bipolar terminals in tiger salamander retinæ were also shown to conduct chloride ions with similar pharmacology to GABAC receptors.¹⁷⁰,¹⁷¹

For a long time, CACA (43) was believed to be a selective partial agonist for GABAC receptors. Unlike TACA (44), it is neither a substrate for nor an inhibitor of GABA:2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase in extracts of rat brain mitochondria, nor does it influence the activity of glutamate decarboxylase in rat brain extracts.¹² However, uptake studies have shown that CACA (43) acts as a weak inhibitor of β-alanine uptake in rat cerebral cortex slices.¹⁷² CACA (43) is a weak substrate for a transporter that transports GABA, β-alanine, and nipecotic acid in glial cells isolated from guinea-pig retina.¹⁷³ Furthermore, CACA (43) stimulates the passive release of \[^{3}H\]GABA and \[^{3}H\]β-alanine by hetero-exchange from slices of rat cerebellum, cerebral cortex, and spinal cord, without influencing potassium-evoked release.¹⁷⁴ CACA (43) is only 10 times weaker as a substrate for the transporter than as a partial agonist at the GABAC receptors. This transporter may be related to the GAT-3 protein, a GABA transporter located predominantly on glial cells in the CNS.¹⁷⁴

To date, the most selective agonist at GABAC receptors is (±)-CAMP, more specifically (+)-CAMP (2),²⁹ while TPMPA (6) is the most selective antagonist at these receptors.³¹,³⁸

### 4.6.1. GABAC Receptor Agonists and Partial Agonists

SAR studies have been carried out on GABAC receptors in a variety of systems, which include GABAC receptors on rod horizontal cells of white perch retina as well as bovine retinal RNA³⁰ and human homologous ρ1 and ρ2 cRNAs expressed in Xenopus oocytes.¹³⁵,¹³⁸,¹⁷⁵–¹⁷⁷ From these studies, GABA (1), TACA (44), 2-FTACA (45, 2-fluoro-trans-4-aminocrotonic acid), and (±)-CAMP were shown to be agonists, while TAMP (46, trans-2-(aminomethyl)cyclopropanecarboxylic acid), CACA (43), imidazole-4-acetic acid (47,

Perspective

I4AA), muscimol (48), isoguvacine (49), and homohypotaurine (50) were shown to be partial agonists at GABA<sub>c</sub> receptors. The order of agonist/partial agonist potency at GABA<sub>c</sub> receptors can be summarized as follows: TACA > GABA > muscimol ≈ 2-FTACA > homohypotaurine > I4AA > TAMP ≫ (±)-CAMP ≈ CACA > isoguvacine. At GABAA<sub>A</sub> receptors, the order of potency is muscimol ≫ GABA ≈ TACA > isoguvacine ≫ CACA. From these SAR studies, it appears that the partially folded conformation of GABA that activates GABA<sub>c</sub> receptors is similar to the conformation which TACA, CACA, and (±)-CAMP can attain. However, a more extended conformation of GABA is required to activate GABAA<sub>A</sub> receptors, and this conformation is inaccessible to CACA.

CACA (43), which was the first compound to distinguish GABA<sub>c</sub> receptors from GABAA<sub>A</sub> receptors, is a moderate partial agonist at human ρ1 and ρ2 receptors expressed in Xenopus oocytes (EC<sub>50</sub>(ρ1) 74 μM; EC<sub>50</sub>(ρ2) 70 μM) and shows 70–80% of the efficacy of GABA.<sup>135,175</sup> The potency and efficacy of CACA at these receptors is similar to those found in GABA<sub>c</sub> receptors derived from bovine retinal RNA expressed in Xenopus oocytes<sup>30</sup> but not to those found in white perch retinae using patch clamp electrophysiology. These results indicate that GABA<sub>c</sub> receptors in the retina may consist of ρ subunits and are heterogeneous. Other differences were also observed with the pharmacology of native GABA<sub>c</sub> receptors in white perch retina compared to those expressed in oocytes. Isoguvacine (49) is an agonist in the perch retina, while in Xenopus oocytes it is a partial agonist; I4AA (47) is a pure antagonist in the retina but a partial agonist in oocytes; THIP (3) is less potent as an antagonist in the retina than in oocytes; and muscimol (48) has a lower efficacy in the retina than in oocytes. The differences in the pharmacology observed in the white perch retina and in oocytes may be attributed to differences in species, receptor heterogeneity, or phosphorylation states that may influence pharmacological actions.

Muscimol (48) is an analogue of GABA where the carboxylic acid moiety of GABA is replaced by an isoxazole ring system. It has two low-energy conformations, one in an extended and one in a partially folded conformation. Muscimol (48) is widely used as a pharmacological tool to study GABAA<sub>A</sub> receptors. However, muscimol is a potent partial agonist, albeit weaker than GABA, at both human ρ1 (K<sub>D</sub> 2.3 μM) and ρ2 (K<sub>D</sub> 1.4 μM) GABA<sub>c</sub> receptors expressed in oocytes,<sup>135,175</sup> bovine retinal RNA expressed in oocytes,<sup>30</sup> and rod horizontal cells of white perch retina.<sup>167</sup> Muscimol is more potent at GABA<sub>c</sub> than GABAA<sub>A</sub> receptors expressed in oocytes.<sup>30,135,175</sup> Therefore, one requires caution when using muscimol (48) to study GABAA<sub>A</sub> receptors.

The sulfonic acid analogue of GABA, homohypotaurine (50), is a potent partial agonist at ρ1 GABA<sub>c</sub> receptors expressed in Xenopus oocytes (EC<sub>50</sub> 4.6 μM), albeit weaker than GABA, activating 69% of the maximal response produced by GABA.<sup>177</sup> Thus, the sulfonic acid group appears to reduce the ability of homohypotaurine to activate the channel of ρ1 GABA<sub>c</sub> receptors in oocytes.

TACA (44) is approximately 120 times more potent than CACA (43) at homooligomeric ρ1 and ρ2 GABA<sub>c</sub>

Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, 2000, Vol. 43, No. 8 1439

receptors expressed in Xenopus oocytes. It has a high efficacy, activating 95% of the maximal response produced by GABA, and is the most potent agonist at GABA<sub>c</sub> receptors expressed in oocytes (EC<sub>50</sub>(ρ1) 0.6 μM; EC<sub>50</sub>(ρ2) 0.4 μM<sup>135,175</sup>). Halogeno and methyl substituents on the C2, C3, and C4 positions of TACA produced a marked reduction in both the efficacy and affinity of the compound for ρ1 GABA<sub>c</sub> receptors expressed in oocytes.<sup>177</sup> Out of the C2, C3, and C4 positions, only the C2 position of TACA tolerated any form of substitution. 2-FTACA (45), substituted with a fluoro group at the C2 position, is a potent agonist (EC<sub>50</sub> 2.43 μM), albeit weaker than the parent compound, TACA (EC<sub>50</sub> 0.44 μM), at human ρ1 GABA<sub>c</sub> receptors expressed in Xenopus oocytes. It has a high efficacy, activating 90% of the maximal response produced by GABA.<sup>177</sup> Other substituents including a methyl group at the C2 position markedly reduced both the affinity and activity of the compound for this receptor. Substituents on the C2 position of GABA, including chloro, methyl, and methylene substituents, also reduced the affinity and activity for human ρ1 GABA<sub>c</sub> receptors expressed in Xenopus oocytes. These results indicate that larger substituents on the C2 position may interact unfavorably with the receptor protein when undergoing receptor activation.<sup>177</sup>

TAMP (46) is a moderately potent partial agonist with low efficacy at ρ1 and ρ2 GABA<sub>c</sub> receptors expressed in Xenopus oocytes (EC<sub>50</sub>(ρ1) 20 μM; EC<sub>50</sub>(ρ2) 17.5 μM<sup>135,175</sup>). TAMP activates ρ1 and ρ2 GABA<sub>c</sub> receptors by 25% and 43% of the maximal response produced by GABA, respectively.<sup>135,175</sup> In contrast to TAMP, (±)-CAMP is a moderately potent full agonist at ρ1 and ρ2 GABA<sub>c</sub> receptors (EC<sub>50</sub>(ρ1) 68.0 μM; EC<sub>50</sub>(ρ2) 34.5 μM<sup>135,175</sup>). CAMP has no effect in inhibiting [³H]GABA uptake in cortical slices and thus may be the most selective agonist at GABA<sub>c</sub> receptors.<sup>162</sup>

4.6.2. Competitive GABA<sub>c</sub> Receptor Antagonists. TPMPA (6) and TPEPA (51, 1,2,5,6-tetrahydropyridin-4-ylethylphosphinic acid) are the most selective GABA<sub>c</sub> receptor antagonists to date. These compounds were developed from the observation that isoguvacine, a conformationally restricted analogue of TACA held in a partially folded conformation, has activity at both GABAA<sub>A</sub> and GABA<sub>c</sub> receptors but no activity at GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors. Thus, the tetrahydropyridine ring distinguishes GABA<sub>B</sub> from GABA<sub>c</sub> receptors but does not distinguish GABAA<sub>A</sub> from GABA<sub>c</sub> receptors. As discussed previously, the methylphosphinic acid group can distinguish GABA<sub>c</sub> from GABAA<sub>A</sub> receptors. Thus by incorporating a tetrahydropyridine ring system with either a methylphosphinic or ethylphosphinic moiety, potent and selective antagonists at GABA<sub>c</sub> receptor were developed.<sup>31,38</sup> TPMPA is twice as potent as TPEPA, which further establishes that an increase in the alkyl group on the alkylphosphinic acid reduces GABA<sub>c</sub> receptor affinity. TPMPA is more than 100 times more selective in blocking ρ1 GABA<sub>c</sub> receptors than in blocking GABAA<sub>A</sub> receptors from rat cerebral cortex poly-(A⁺) RNA expressed in Xenopus oocytes.<sup>31</sup> At GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors, TPMPA is a weak agonist when measured by whole-cell patch recordings from pyramidal neurons in rat hippocampal slices.<sup>31</sup> TPMPA is more than 500 times more selective in blocking ρ1 GABA<sub>c</sub> receptors expressed in Xenopus oocytes than in activating GABA<sub>B</sub>

receptors.³¹ Furthermore, TPMPA was found to be 8 times weaker at ρ2 than at ρ1 GABAC receptors expressed in Xenopus oocytes.¹³⁸ TPMPA has been shown to block responses in the neonatal rat spinal cord providing evidence for the involvement of GABAC receptors in synaptic transmission in this tissue.¹⁷⁸

From SAR studies, many GABAC receptor antagonists have been identified. These include a variety of phosphinic, methylphosphinic, and phosphonic acids (52–59), DAVA (60, δ-aminovaleric acid, \(K_{\mathrm{B}}\) 20 μM), 2-MeTACA (61, 2-methyl-trans-4-aminocrotonic acid, \(K_{\mathrm{B}}\) 45 μM), P4S (4, piperidine-4-sulfonic acid, \(K_{\mathrm{B}}\) 81 μM), 3-aminopropylphosphonic acid (58, \(K_{\mathrm{B}}\) 10 μM), isonipecotic acid (62, \(K_{\mathrm{B}} > 100\) μM), and THIP (3, \(K_{\mathrm{B}}\) 32 μM). Other compounds such as strychnine (\(K_{\mathrm{B}}\) 69 μM), ZAPA (63, Z-3-[(aminoiminomethyl)thio]prop-2-enoic acid, \(K_{\mathrm{B}}\) 19 μM), and SR-95331 (64, gabazine, 2-(3-carboxypropyl)-3-amino-6-(p-methoxyphenyl)pyridazinium bromide, \(K_{\mathrm{B}}\) 35 μM) are also moderately potent GABAC receptor antagonists at bovine retinal poly(A)+ RNA expressed in Xenopus oocytes.³⁰ The order of potency for competitive antagonists at GABAC receptors is as follows: methylphosphinic acids ≥ phosphinic acids > 3-APA > ZAPA ≈ DAVA > THIP ≈ SR-95331 > 2-MeTACA > strychnine > P4S > isonipecotic acid.

P4S (4) is the sulfonic acid analogue of isoguvacine. It was first developed as a GABAA receptor ligand and appears to have similar potency as GABA in activating GABAA receptors from rat cortex RNA expressed in Xenopus oocytes (\(K_{\mathrm{D}}\) 104 μM).³⁰ However, this compound is a partial agonist, activating rat brain GABAA receptors expressed in Xenopus oocytes by <30% of the currents produced by GABA.³⁰ P4S produced no response on its own but was shown to be a moderately potent antagonist at GABAC receptors from retinal RNA expressed in oocytes.³⁰

Phosphonic acid analogues of GABA, such as 3-aminopropylphosphonic acid (58), differentiate between GABAA and GABAC receptors. 3-Aminopropylphosphonic acid is a moderately potent inhibitor of GABAC

receptors. This compound has no clear action as an agonist or antagonist at GABAA receptors from rat cortex RNA expressed in Xenopus oocytes.³⁰ However, 3-aminopropylphosphonic acid is not selective for GABAC receptors. It has weak depressant effects on the CNS that is insensitive to bicuculline, and it acts as a partial agonist at peripheral GABAB receptors. Like 3-aminopropylphosphonic acid, 4-aminobutylphosphonic acid had little effect on GABAA receptors. It is a weak inhibitor of GABAB receptors but only has weak inhibitory effects on GABAC receptors. 2-Aminoethylphosphonic acid is largely inactive at GABAC receptors.³⁰

To date, the most potent classes of GABAC receptor antagonists are the methylphosphinic acid analogues, followed by the phosphinic acid analogues, of GABA. The most potent GABAC antagonist is 3APMPA (52, (3-aminopropyl)methylphosphinic acid). The phosphinic acid analogue of GABA, 3APPA (53, 3-aminopropylphosphinic acid), is approximately 3 times weaker than 3APMPA ((3-aminopropyl)methylphosphinic acid). Thus, the methyl group may either bind to a small hydrophobic pocket on the binding site and/or alter the \(pK_{\mathrm{A}}\) to improve binding. Similar results were observed with the methylphosphinic and phosphinic acid analogues of TACA, CGP44530 (54, (E-3-aminopropen-1-yl)methylphosphinic acid) and CGP38593 (55, E-3-aminopropen-1-ylphosphinic acid) respectively, and the methylphosphinic and phosphinic acid analogues of CACA, CGP70523 (56, (Z-3-aminopropen-1-yl)methylphosphinic acid) and CGP70522 (57, Z-3-aminopropen-1-ylphosphinic acid) respectively.¹⁷⁶ The methylphosphinic acids CGP44530 (54) and CGP70523 (56) were more potent antagonists than the corresponding phosphinic acid analogues CGP38593 (55) and CGP70522 (57). However, the unsaturated methylphosphinic and phosphinic acid analogues were weaker than the corresponding saturated analogues.¹⁷⁶

3APMPA (52), 3APPA (53), CGP44530 (54), CGP38593 (55), and CGP70523 (56) are not selective GABAC receptor antagonists as they all activate GABAB receptors. However, the methylphosphinic and phosphinic acid moieties dramatically reduce affinity for GABAA receptors. Thus, the methylphosphinic and phosphinic acid substituents are able to differentiate GABAA from GABAC receptors but not from GABAB receptors. This could be attributed to the different \(pK_{\mathrm{A}}\) activity between the carboxylic and phosphinic acids, as well as the orientation which the different acid groups can attain.

The phosphinic acid moiety is tetrahedral, while the carboxylic acid moiety is planar. The relative lack of selectivity of the methylphosphinic and phosphinic acid analogues of TACA and particularly of CACA is unexpected but may be explained by the higher degree of rotational freedom between the C2 and C3 bonds and between the phosphorus and C1 bonds. Thus, these compounds are more likely to attain conformations that bind to both GABA<sub>B</sub> and GABA<sub>C</sub> receptors.<sup>176</sup>

An increase in the size of the alkyl group on the alkylphosphinic acid moiety reduces the affinity at GABA<sub>C</sub> receptors. CGP36742 (59, (3-aminopropyl)butylphosphinic acid) is a moderately potent antagonist, while CGP35348, the diethoxymethyl analogue of GABA, has no effect at GABA<sub>C</sub> receptors.<sup>176</sup>

### 4.6.3. Noncompetitive GABA<sub>C</sub> Receptor Antagonists

Picrotoxinin and the related chloride channel inhibitor, *t*-butylbicyclophosphorothionate (TBPS), blocked homooligomeric ρ1 GABA<sub>C</sub> receptors expressed in Xenopus oocytes. However, these compounds were 30 and 250 times weaker at GABA<sub>C</sub> than GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors expressed in Xenopus oocytes.<sup>26</sup> The picrotoxinin sensitivity of GABA<sub>C</sub> receptors derived from ρ1 and ρ2 subunits has been found to be dependent on agonist concentration, as picrotoxinin may be a use-dependent antagonist interacting with open chloride channels. Furthermore, studies have shown that a single amino acid residue in the M2 region of the ρ2 subunit confers picrotoxinin sensitivity.<sup>128,179,180</sup> Coexpression of ρ1 and ρ2 subunits in Xenopus oocytes gives rise to functional receptors with picrotoxinin insensitivity<sup>128</sup> similar to native GABA<sub>C</sub> receptors in rat retina.<sup>26</sup> Thus pseudo-heteromeric as well as homomeric GABA<sub>C</sub> receptors may exist in vivo.

### 4.6.4. GABA<sub>C</sub> Receptor Modulators

GABA<sub>C</sub> receptors are not modulated by benzodiazepines, steroids, or barbiturates, and in fact little is known about GABA<sub>C</sub> receptor modulators. GABA<sub>C</sub> receptors in rat bipolar cells have been shown to be modulated by protein kinase C.<sup>181</sup> Furthermore, low micromolar concentrations of glycine have also been shown to modulate the effect of a submaximal concentration of GABA at ρ1 GABA<sub>C</sub> receptors expressed in Xenopus oocytes.<sup>182</sup> However, at millimolar concentrations, glycine directly activates these receptors. Glycine modulation of GABAergic synapses may play an important role in synaptic transmission.<sup>182</sup>

### 4.7. Differences between GABA<sub>C</sub> Receptor Subtypes

Some SAR differences between human ρ1 and ρ2 receptor subtypes have been noted. These include the intrinsic activity (calculated as a percentage of the maximum whole cell current produced by a maximum dose of GABA) of the partial agonist, I4AA (47), being 7-fold higher at ρ2 than ρ1 receptors.<sup>135</sup> I4AA is an analogue of GABA where the amino group of GABA has been replaced by an imidazole ring. Due to a resonance charge distribution between the two nitrogens of the imidazole ring system, there is a weakening of the charge at the basic end of the molecule. I4AA is a moderately potent partial agonist (EC<sub>50</sub> 16 μM), with low intrinsic activity (*I*<sub>m</sub> 3%) at ρ1 GABA<sub>C</sub> receptors expressed in Xenopus oocytes.<sup>175</sup> However, it is a more potent antagonist at this receptor (*K*<sub>B</sub> 1.5 μM), with an affinity similar to that of GABA at ρ1 GABA<sub>C</sub> receptors.

Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, 2000, Vol. 43, No. 8 1441

tors.<sup>138</sup> I4AA was shown to activate ρ2 GABA<sub>C</sub> receptors expressed in Xenopus oocytes. It is a potent partial agonist (EC<sub>50</sub> 3 μM) with a higher intrinsic activity for the ρ2 (*I*<sub>m</sub> 38%) than the ρ1 GABA<sub>C</sub> receptors.<sup>135,138,175</sup>

2-MeTACA (61) is a moderately potent inhibitor of ρ1 GABA<sub>C</sub> receptors expressed in Xenopus oocytes (*K*<sub>B</sub> 45 μM). In contrast, 2-MeTACA (61) activates the human ρ2 GABA<sub>C</sub> receptor subtype (EC<sub>50</sub> 101 μM) by 34% of the maximal response produced by GABA.<sup>138</sup> Although receptor binding was less favorable at the ρ2 compared to the ρ1 GABA<sub>C</sub> receptors, steric interaction between the C2 substituent and the receptor protein may play an important role in activation. Thus, 2-MeTACA (61) can pharmacologically distinguish between the human ρ1 and ρ2 homooligomeric GABA<sub>C</sub> receptor subtypes.<sup>138</sup>

## 5. Future Directions

While great progress has been made in our understanding of the medicinal chemistry and molecular biology of GABA-activated ligand-gated ion channels over the past decade, this has been achieved without significant input from combinatorial chemistry, high-throughput screening, or structure-based drug design. We can expect important advances from these key strategies in the future, with structural leads coming from the side effects of other drugs and from herbal extracts. In addition, genomics will reveal links between specific GABA receptor gene products and neurological disorders, which will provide specific targets for drug development via complementary SAR studies.

While some classic combinatorial chemistry was carried out on benzodiazepines, this did not lead to better modulators of GABA-activated ligand-gated ion channels but rather to novel agents that interact with other classes of receptors, e.g., cholecystokinin receptors.<sup>183</sup> The only reported use of combinatorial chemistry for the development of new GABA receptor agents has been the generation of small libraries of flavones by solution-phase combinatorial chemistry that have yielded novel flavone derivatives that modulate GABA receptors.<sup>184</sup> The great chemical diversity of agents acting on GABA-activated ligand-gated ion channels described in this Perspective should provide significant opportunities for the application of combinatorial chemistry to the discovery of new agents with selective actions on the various subtypes of these receptors.

The high-throughput screening of agents acting on ligand-gated ion channel receptors has proved difficult. Limited success has been achieved using binding assays, but functional assays are needed to differentiate between agonists, partial agonists, antagonists, and modulators of these receptors. High-throughput screening functional assays have been described for ligand-gated cation channel receptors such as nicotinic acetylcholine receptors<sup>185</sup> and the NMDA subtypes of ionotropic glutamate receptors,<sup>186</sup> but no high-throughput functional assays have been described thus far for ligand-gated anion channel receptors such as ionotropic GABA receptors. The development of such assays is highly desirable.

An important strategic question for high-throughput functional assays for GABA-activated ligand-gated ion channels is what protein subunit combinations should

1442  Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, 2000, Vol. 43, No. 8

be used in the primary screens? Given that the discovery of subunit-specific GABA receptor ligands is a major goal, it may be that particular target receptor subtypes will have to be selected on the basis of, for example, association with a specific genetic disorder. To achieve the desired specificity, only compounds that have no or very little interaction with the ubiquitous subtypes of GABA receptors will be of interest. This means that new structural classes of test compounds will need to be developed, e.g., by screening diverse combinatorial libraries, by following structural leads from the side effects of other drugs such as the apparent selectivity of the diuretic furosemide (7) for particular amino acids in α6 GABA receptor subunits,^{48} and from herbal extracts. Many herbal extracts have been reported to influence the activity of GABA-activated ligand gated ion channels: e.g., extracts of Ginkgo biloba^{187} and ginseng.^{188}

Structure-based drug design depends on the availability of good structural data for the target receptor. High-resolution structural information on ligand-gated ion channels is rather sparse, but the determination of the crystal structure of a ligand-binding region of an ionotropic glutamate receptor in a complex with the agonist kainate^{189} suggests that similar information will be soon forthcoming for GABA-activated ligand gated ion channels. Molecular modeling of receptor sites is another approach which has been applied to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors^{190} and to GABA-activated ligand gated ion channels,^{191} while methods are being developed for predicting the location of ligand-binding sites on protein surfaces.^{192} The relatively simple homomeric GABAC receptors would appear to be excellent targets for high-resolution structural data by crystal studies and molecular modeling.

Pharmacogenomics is regarded as one of the 'hottest' fields in biotechnology today.^{193} Genetic polymorphisms in receptors and other drug targets are being linked to individual differences in drug efficacy, metabolism, and side effects.^{194} The era of 'one drug fits all patients' is seen as about to give way to individualized therapy matching a patient's unique genetic makeup with an optimally effective drug.^{193} High-throughput analysis of differential gene expression, via 'DNA chips' and other technology, is now a reality.^{195} While mutations of receptors in disease states appear to be relatively uncommon, inheritable mutations GABAA receptors have been identified.^{22} Disruption of the gene coding for the β3 GABAA receptor subunit has been associated with Angelman syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by mental retardation and epilepsy.^{196} Knockout mice that lack this gene exhibit electroencephalograph abnormalities, seizures, and behavioral characteristics typically associated with Angelman syndrome.^{196} Rett syndrome, an X-linked dominant neurodevelopmental disorder, may involve the gene coding for the α3 GABAA receptor subunit,^{197} while a number of studies have linked polymorphisms in the genes coding for the α6, β1, β2, and γ2 GABAA receptor subunits with alcohol dependence syndrome and Korsakoff's psychosis.^{198,199} The genes coding for ρ1 and ρ2 GABAC receptor subunits are located in a region of chromosome 6q that contains loci for inherited disorders of the eye.^{35} These studies indicate that genetic disor-

ders of GABA-activated ligand gated ion channels may represent key therapeutic targets and that the development of drugs acting on abnormal GABA receptor gene products is an important endeavor. Site-directed mutagenesis studies of recombinant GABA receptors show that changing even a single amino acid residue can have major effects on drug sensitivity. For example, changing T328 to a hydrophobic amino acid confers barbiturate sensitivity on the ρ1 GABAC subunit.^{143,144} Thus, meaningful pharmacogenomics in relation to drugs acting on GABA-activated ligand gated ion channels is a distinct possibility, with complementary SAR studies^{21} involving structural variations of both the ligands and their receptor targets playing a vital role.

## 6. Conclusion

This Perspective highlights the remarkable structural diversity of natural and synthetic chemicals that interact with GABAA receptors to alter their function in the brain. While medicinal chemistry studies on GABAC receptors are just beginning, it is already clear that GABAC receptors are very different from GABAA receptors in terms of agonist and antagonist structural profiles. Both subfamilies of GABA-activated ligand-gated ion channels are targets for drug development, with major advances likely to result from the interactive application of combinatorial chemistry, high-throughput screening, structure-based drug design, and genomics.
