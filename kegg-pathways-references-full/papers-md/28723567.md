## SUMMARY

Promoting development and function of brown and beige fat may reduce obesity. Here, we show that fat SIRT6 expression is markedly induced by cold exposure and a β-adrenergic agonist. Deletion of SIRT6 in adipose tissue impairs the thermogenic function of brown adipocytes, causing a morphological “whitening” of brown fat, reduced oxygen (O₂) consumption, obesity, decreased core body temperature, and cold sensitivity. Fat SIRT6-deleted mice exhibit increased blood glucose levels, severe insulin resistance, and hepatic steatosis. Moreover, SIRT6 deficiency inhibits the browning of white adipose tissue (WAT) following cold exposure or β3-agonist treatment. Depletion of SIRT6 expression in brown adipocytes reduces expression of thermogenic genes, causing a reduction in cellular respiration. Conversely, SIRT6 overexpression in primary fat cells stimulates the thermogenic program. Mechanistically, SIRT6 interacts with and promotes phospho-ATF2 binding to the PGC-1α gene promoter to activate its expression. The present study reveals a critical role for SIRT6 in regulating thermogenesis of fat.

## INTRODUCTION

Obesity results from a chronic imbalance between energy intake and energy expenditure. WAT is essential for triglyceride storage and endocrine signaling, while brown adipose tissue (BAT) dissipates energy to generate heat through uncoupled respiration mediated by UCP1 ([Lowell and Spiegelman, 2000](https://doi.org/10.1038/nrm1080); [Nedergaard and Cannon, 2010](https://doi.org/10.1038/nature08865); [Rosen and Spiegelman, 2014](https://doi.org/10.1038/nature13476)). Studies have identified a subset of cells in WAT that could be converted into brown-like adipocyte (also called beige or brite cells). In response to environmental or hormonal stimuli, these beige cells undergo a browning process. This browning process has been suggested to have strong anti-obesity and anti-diabetic benefits ([Barbatelli et al., 2010](https://doi.org/10.1038/oby.2009.456); [Cypess et al., 2009](https://doi.org/10.1038/nature08088); [Petrovic et al., 2010](https://doi.org/10.1038/nature09401); [Wu et al., 2012](https://doi.org/10.1038/nature11400)). Studies have revealed that adult humans also have functional UCP1⁺ brown adipocytes ([Cypess et al., 2009](https://doi.org/10.1038/nature08088); [Saito et al., 2009](https://doi.org/10.1038/nature08087); [Vandebona et al., 2009](https://doi.org/10.1038/nature08089); [Virtanen et al., 2009](https://doi.org/10.1038/nature08086)). Thus, promoting development and function of brown and beige fat may represent an attractive treatment for obesity.

PGC-1α is a central regulator of brown fat thermogenesis and is highly expressed in BAT ([Puigserver et al., 1998](https://doi.org/10.1038/25905)). The ectopic expression of PGC-1α in white fat cells activates genes involved in mitochondrial oxidation phosphorylation and thermogenesis ([Puigserver et al., 1998](https://doi.org/10.1038/25905)). A number of different signaling pathways are involved in PGC-1α regulation. Particularly, cyclic AMP (cAMP) signaling is a key activator of PGC-1α transcription in multiple tissues, promoting binding of CREB and activating transcription factor 2 (ATF2) to a conserved DNA response element of PGC-1α promoter. CREB is activated upon glucagon signaling in the liver, while ATF2 is recruited to the PGC-1α promoter after β-adrenergic receptor activation in BAT ([Cao et al., 2004](https://doi.org/10.1038/nm1072); [Herzig et al., 2001](https://doi.org/10.1038/ng708)).

The sirtuins are a family of highly conserved NAD⁺-dependent enzymes, and mammals possess seven sirtuins, termed SIRT1–7. Among the sirtuins, SIRT6 is unique in its constitutive localization to chromatin and functions as an ADP-ribosyltransferase and NAD⁺-dependent deacetylase of both acetyl groups and long-chain fatty-acyl groups ([Gil et al., 2013](https://doi.org/10.1038/nsmb.2548); [Jiang et al., 2013](https://doi.org/10.1038/nsmb.2547); [Kugel and Mostoslavsky, 2014](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molmet.2014.01.001); [Mao et al., 2011](https://doi.org/10.1038/cr.2011.10); [Mostoslavsky et al., 2006](https://doi.org/10.1038/nature04884)). SIRT6 plays a leading role in regulating genomic stability, aging, glucose metabolism, stress response, lifespan, circadian rhythm, and cardiac hypertrophy ([Kanfi et al., 2010](https://doi.org/10.1038/nature09387), [2012](https://doi.org/10.1038/nature11241); [Kawahara et al., 2009](https://doi.org/10.1038/nature08080); [Kim et al., 2010](https://doi.org/10.1038/nature08884); [Masri et al., 2014](https://doi.org/10.1038/nature13048); [Michishita et al., 2008](https://doi.org/10.1038/nature06944); [Mostoslavsky et al., 2006](https://doi.org/10.1038/nature04884); [Sundaresan et al., 2012](https://doi.org/10.1038/nature11087); [Xiao et al., 2010](https://doi.org/10.1038/nature08885); [Zhong et al., 2010](https://doi.org/10.1038/nature08886)). Global SIRT6 knockout (KO) mice display hypoglycemia, premature aging, loss of subcutaneous fat, lymphopenia, and lordokyphosis, dying around 4 weeks ([Mostoslavsky et al., 2006](https://doi.org/10.1038/nature04884); [Xiao et al., 2010](https://doi.org/10.1038/nature08885)). However, the precise molecular mechanism of SIRT6 KO-induced severe metabolic diseases remains unclear.

Identifying key regulators of the thermogenic functions of brown and beige adipocytes has important therapeutic implications for the treatment of obesity and related metabolic diseases. In the present study, we showed that SIRT6 is a critical regulator of brown adipocyte identity and thermogenic function. Ablation of SIRT6 in adipose tissue causes a profound “whitening” phenotype of BAT, reduced energy expenditure, obesity, and insulin resistance.

**RESULTS**

### Adipose SIRT6 Expression Is Increased by Cold Exposure and the β-Adrenergic Agonist

To investigate the physiological function of SIRT6 in adipose tissue, we first analyzed its protein levels in different fat depots of C57BL/6J mice. As shown in Figure 1A, SIRT6 expression was higher in interscapular BAT than in subcutaneous inguinal WAT (iWAT) and visceral epididymal WAT (eWAT). Because cold exposure and β-adrenergic agonists are two classical inducers of adaptive thermogenesis, we examined SIRT6 expression levels in C57 mice following cold exposure or β-adrenergic agonist treatment. SIRT6 mRNA and protein levels in both BAT and iWAT were significantly elevated after cold exposure (Figures 1B–1D). We also detected an increase in SIRT6 mRNA and protein levels in both BAT and iWAT after the β-adrenergic agonist treatment of mice (Figures 1E–1G). As expected, the expression of UCP1 and PGC-1α was also induced by cold exposure and treatment with the β3-adrenergic agonist CL316,243 (Figures 1C, 1D, 1F, and 1G).

Previous studies have suggested that obese animals and humans display a deficiency in BAT thermogenic function (Tokayama and Himms-Hagen, 1986; Vijgen et al., 2011). We next examined SIRT6 expression in BAT of db/db and high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese (DIO) mice. SIRT6 protein abundance was lower in db/db diabetic mice and DIO mice relative to their respective control C57BL/6J and chow diet-fed mice (Figure 1H). Moreover, SIRT6 protein levels in the omental WAT of obese subjects were lower than those of lean subjects (Figure 1I; Table S1). These data suggest that SIRT6 may be involved in the adaptive thermogenesis of fat and decreased adipose SIRT6 expression may impair systemic energy homeostasis.

### SIRT6 Loss of Function in Adipose Tissue Predisposes Mice on a Chow Diet to Obesity, Insulin Resistance, and Hepatosteatosis

To directly investigate whether SIRT6 regulates energy metabolism of adipose in vivo, we generated a fat SIRT6-deleted mouse model. The resulting aP2-Cre; SIRT6<sup>flox/flox</sup> mice are henceforth referred to as SIRT6<sup>ad−/−</sup> mice. Littermates lacking the Cre gene (homozygous SIRT6<sup>flox/flox</sup>) were used as controls. SIRT6 protein levels were not detectable in either white or brown adipose of SIRT6<sup>ad−/−</sup> mice but remained unchanged in other tissues examined (Figure 2A; Figure S1A). Further studies suggested that SIRT6 expression was not detected in mature adipocytes but remained unchanged in stromal-vascular fraction (SVF) cells (Figure 2B). Neonatal SIRT6<sup>ad−/−</sup> mice appeared morphologically normal, indicating that adipocyte SIRT6 deficiency does not affect fetal development.

On a chow diet, the body weights of the mice diverged at 6 weeks of age, with SIRT6<sup>ad−/−</sup> mice gaining more weight than control mice (Figures 2C and 2D). To determine the cause of the increased body weight of SIRT6<sup>ad−/−</sup> mice, we weighed different fat pads (including BAT, iWAT, and eWAT) and organs. The individual fat pads of SIRT6<sup>ad−/−</sup> mice were larger and weighed more than those of control mice (Figures 2E and 2F; Figure S1B). Consistently, histological analysis (H&E staining) revealed adipocyte hypertrophy of these fat depots in SIRT6<sup>ad−/−</sup> mice. The lipid droplets in brown and white adipocytes of SIRT6<sup>ad−/−</sup> mice were markedly larger (Figure 2G). Although SIRT6 deficiency increased the size of inguinal and epididymal adipocytes, the adipocyte number was not altered (Figures S1C and S1D). SIRT6<sup>ad−/−</sup> mice exhibited a profound whitening of interscapular BAT (Figure 2F). Consistently, unilocular fat cells were observed in BAT of SIRT6<sup>ad−/−</sup> mice, indicating that SIRT6 deficiency induces a brown-to-white fat switch (Figure 2G). However, adipose SIRT6 deficiency did not affect the weight of kidneys, heart, and spleen under chow diet conditions (data not shown). MRI examination confirmed that SIRT6<sup>ad−/−</sup> mice had more fat mass than control mice (Figure 2H). Obesity is often accompanied by increased lipid stores in the liver (Unger et al., 2010). SIRT6<sup>ad−/−</sup> mice displayed severe fatty liver phenotype on a chow diet, as revealed by gross morphology, H&E staining, and hepatic triglyceride quantification (Figure 2I; Figure S1E). Thus, the higher body mass in SIRT6<sup>ad−/−</sup> mice is attributable to a greater adipose tissue weight and enlarged fatty liver.

When challenged with a HFD, SIRT6<sup>ad−/−</sup> mice were more prone to obesity than controls (Figures S2A and S2B). The interscapular BAT of SIRT6<sup>ad−/−</sup> mice was visibly paler than that of control mice (Figure S2C). The fatty liver phenotype was more severe in SIRT6<sup>ad−/−</sup> mice than in control mice (Figure S2D).

Neonatal SIRT6<sup>ad−/−</sup> mice displayed normal blood glucose levels (data not shown), indicating that the hypoglycemia and postnatal lethality observed in SIRT6 null mice (Mostoslavsky et al., 2006) did not result from SIRT6 deficiency in adipose tissues. We next tested the glucose tolerance and insulin response of SIRT6<sup>ad−/−</sup> mice at 8 weeks of age. The basal blood glucose

levels of 6 hr-fasted SIRT6<sup>ad−/−</sup> mice were higher relative to control mice on a chow diet (Figure 2J). On a HFD, the blood glucose levels in 16 hr-fasted SIRT6<sup>ad−/−</sup> mice were also higher; this was not observed in chow diet-fed SIRT6<sup>ad−/−</sup> mice fasted for 16 hr (Figure S2E; data not shown). The glucose tolerance test revealed that SIRT6<sup>ad−/−</sup> mice had significantly impaired glucose tolerance compared to control mice (Figure 2K). Insulin tolerance tests (ITTs) also showed evidence of insulin resistance in SIRT6<sup>ad−/−</sup> mice (Figure 2L). Similar results were obtained in HFD-fed SIRT6<sup>ad−/−</sup> mice (Figures S2F and S2G). Consistent with ITT data, the effects of insulin on Akt phosphorylation in WAT, BAT, and liver were attenuated in SIRT6<sup>ad−/−</sup> mice (Figure 2M). Thus, the increased basal glucose levels and impaired glucose tolerance are likely due to impaired insulin signaling in SIRT6<sup>ad−/−</sup> mice. Collectively, these data suggest that loss of SIRT6 function in adipose tissue impairs whole-body metabolism.

### SIRT6 Deficiency Reduces Whole-Body Energy Expenditure and Impairs the Thermogenic Function of BAT

We next sought to identify potential mechanisms of SIRT6 deficiency-induced obesity. SIRT6<sup>ad−/−</sup> mice and control mice had similar food intake (Figure S3A). Considering that SIRT6<sup>ad−/−</sup> mice exhibited a profound whitening phenotype of interscapular BAT, we speculated that SIRT6 deficiency might influence the thermogenic function of brown fat.

To examine this hypothesis, gas exchange and activity levels were monitored by housing mice in metabolic cages. Considering that the explanation of causality in metabolic cage analysis is clearer in groups of mice with similar body weights ([Butler and Kozak, 2010](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2010.05.047); [Nedergaard and Cannon, 2014](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2014.01.058)), we used body weight-matched 6-week-old SIRT6<sup>ad−/−</sup> mice and controls. SIRT6<sup>ad−/−</sup> mice showed no changes in locomotor activity compared to controls (Figure S3B). In contrast, energy expenditure was lower in SIRT6<sup>ad−/−</sup> mice during both light and dark cycles (Figures 3A–3C). However, SIRT6<sup>ad−/−</sup> mice and control mice had a similar respiratory exchange ratio (Figure S3C), indicating similar utilization of carbohydrate and fat as energy sources in these mice on a chow diet. In addition, anesthetized SIRT6<sup>ad−/−</sup> mice had lower oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) consumption (Figure 3D). Consistent with a decreased basal metabolic rate, we observed a significant reduction in core body temperature in SIRT6<sup>ad−/−</sup> mice at room temperature (Figure 3E). When subjected to acute cold exposure, SIRT6<sup>ad−/−</sup> mice showed a rapid decrease in rectal temperature at 4°C (Figure 3F). Thermographic imaging of these mice confirmed the decreased surface temperature of interscapular BAT (Figure 3G). Imaging with <sup>18</sup>fluorodeoxyglucose (<sup>[18</sup>F]-FDG) positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) clearly showed a marked decrease in <sup>[18</sup>F]-FDG uptake in BAT of SIRT6<sup>ad−/−</sup> mice compared to

control mice (Figure 3H). Collectively, these data suggest attenuated metabolic activity of BAT in SIRT6<sup>ad−/−</sup> mice and decreased energy expenditure contributes to increased adiposity in SIRT6<sup>ad−/−</sup> mice.

We therefore examined the expression of genes associated with thermogenesis, fatty acid oxidation, and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation in BAT harvested from SIRT6<sup>ad−/−</sup> mice and controls. Consistent with the reduced metabolic function of BAT, SIRT6 deficiency led to a decrease in the expression of thermogenic genes, including PGC-1α, UCP1, and Dio2 (Figure 3I). The expression of PPARα, an essential factor involved in fatty acid oxidation, and its target genes, including Cpt1b and Acadvl, was also decreased in SIRT6<sup>ad−/−</sup> mice. However, the general markers of WAT and BAT differentiation, such as adiponectin, PPARγ, and aP2, were not changed (Figure 3I). Immunohistochemical analysis also reveals less intense UCP1 immunoreactivity in BAT of SIRT6<sup>ad−/−</sup> mice (Figure S3D). In addition, SIRT6 deficiency decreased the expression of transcription factors involved in mitochondrial biogenesis, including Nrf1, Tfam, and Tfb2m (Figure 3J), which have also been identified as direct target genes of PGC-1α ([Wu et al., 1999](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0092-8674(00)80029-6)), thereby decreasing mitochondrial number (Figure 3K). However, the size and ultrastructure of mitochondria of BAT of SIRT6<sup>ad−/−</sup> mice are indistinguishable from their controls (Figure S3E). Similar results were obtained in mice fed a HFD (Figures S2H–S2J). Considering that CL316,243 treatment induces fat SIRT6 expression in normal mice, we examined the role of SIRT6 in the CL316,243-induced thermogenic program. Fat SIRT6 deficiency abolished the stimulatory effect of CL316,243 on the thermogenic genes of BAT and O<sub>2</sub> consumption (Figure 3L–3N), indicating that fat SIRT6 is required for CL316,243-induced thermogenesis.

### SIRT6 Regulates Brown Adipocyte Thermogenic Function

To determine whether SIRT6 affects the thermogenic program in primary adipocytes, we harvested the SVF from the brown fat pads of newborn SIRT6<sup>flox/flox</sup> mice and treated with adenovirus-expressing Cre recombinase (Ad-Cre) or adenovirus-expressing GFP (Ad-GFP) as a control. Ad-Cre treatment efficiently reduced SIRT6 expression in primary differentiated brown adipocytes; however, SIRT6 depletion did not affect the morphological differentiation of precursor cells or the expression of general adipocyte markers (Figures 4A–4C). In addition, the depletion of SIRT6 in primary adipocytes did not significantly affect the expression of genes involved in lipogenesis (Srebfl and Fasn), fatty acid uptake (CD36), and lipolysis (ATGL, HSL, and MGL) (Figure 4C). In contrast, SIRT6 depletion markedly decreased the expression of PGC-1α and other thermogenic genes (Figure 4C). Similar results were obtained in primary brown adipocytes from SIRT6<sup>ad−/−</sup> mice and SIRT6<sup>flox/flox</sup>

controls (Figures S4A–S4C). Using a Seahorse XF-24 extracellular flux analyzer, we observed that basal mitochondrial respiration and maximal mitochondrial respiratory capacity decreased in SIRT6-depleted differentiated adipocytes, as did oligomycin-dependent uncoupled cellular respiration (Figure 4D). These studies suggest that SIRT6 is not required for adipogenesis per se and that the effects of SIRT6 deficiency on the thermogenic program are cell autonomous.

Conversely, the ectopic expression of SIRT6 in primary brown adipocytes stimulated the thermogenic program, subsequently enhancing the basal consumption rate and uncoupled O₂ consumption rate (OCR) (Figures 4E and 4F). Moreover, the effects of SIRT6 on O₂ consumption and thermogenesis in brown adipocytes are dependent on UCP1 (Figures 4G and 4H). We also performed SIRT6 gain-of-function studies in primary beige adipocytes. Primary SVF from iWAT of wild-type (WT) mice infected with adenovirus-expressing SIRT6 (Ad-SIRT6) were induced into differentiation toward beige adipocyte in vitro. Again, SIRT6 overexpression in these cells induced thermogenic gene expression, thereby increasing the OCR at the basal and isoproterenol-stimulated states (Figures S4D and S4E).

### SIRT6 Regulates the Browning of WAT in Response to Cold Exposure and the β-Adrenergic Agonist

Studies have suggested that beige adipocytes in WAT contribute to adipose tissue thermogenesis (Cohen et al., 2014; Schulz et al., 2013). We next examined the metabolic consequence of SIRT6 deficiency in WAT.

We treated SIRT6<sup>ad−/−</sup> mice and controls with CL316,243 for 10 days. The iWAT of CL316,243-treated control mice appeared browner than that of CL316,243-treated SIRT6<sup>ad−/−</sup> mice (Figure 5A). Furthermore, CL316,243 treatment of control mice led to the occurrence of abundant UCP1<sup>+</sup> beige adipocyte with multilocular lipid droplets (Figures 5B and 5C). Transmission electron microscopy revealed that CL316,243 treatment increased the number of mitochondria in adipocytes of the iWAT in control mice (Figure S5A). However, the effects of CL316,243 were almost abolished in SIRT6<sup>ad−/−</sup> mice (Figures 5A–5C; Figure S5A). Consistently, CL316,243 treatment increased the thermogenic gene expression in iWAT of control mice compared to saline treatment, whereas these stimulatory effects were lost in SIRT6<sup>ad−/−</sup> mice (Figures 5D and 5E). Similar results were obtained in the eWAT of SIRT6<sup>ad−/−</sup> and control mice (Figures 5F–5H).

In addition to CL316,243, we exposed SIRT6<sup>ad−/−</sup> mice and control mice to 12°C, a moderately low temperature, for 3 weeks (Qiang et al., 2012). Chronic cold exposure led to the appearance of smaller, multilocular beige adipocyte with intense UCP1 immunoreactivity in the iWAT of control mice. However, this effect was markedly attenuated in the iWAT of SIRT6<sup>ad−/−</sup> mice (Figure S5B). Similarly, SIRT6 deficiency abolished the induction of thermogenic genes by cold exposure (Figures S5C and S5D). Furthermore, these data indicated that long-term (3 weeks) moderate cold exposure (12°C) induced the modest browning of eWAT, and SIRT6 deficiency almost abolished the browning effect induced by cold exposure (Figures S5E–S5G). These data indicate that SIRT6 is essential for β-adrenergic agonist-induced and cold-induced WAT browning.

#### SIRT6 Deficiency in Adipocytes Reduces p-ATF2 Binding to the Promoter of PGC-1α, Subsequently Decreasing the Expression of PGC-1α and Its Target Gene

We next studied the molecular mechanism by which SIRT6 regulates PGC-1α gene expression. SIRT6 has been identified as a deacetylase for both H3K9 and H3K56 (Michishita et al., 2008, 2009; Sundaresan et al., 2012; Yang et al., 2009). Thus, we first measured the acetylation levels of both H3K9 and H3K56 in the promoter of PGC-1α gene in the brown fat of SIRT6<sup>ad−/−</sup> and control mice. Although the levels of total acetylated H3K9 and H3K56 were slightly higher in whole-cell extracts from the brown fat of SIRT6<sup>ad−/−</sup> mice than those in control mice (Figure S6A), we did not observe a significant difference in acetylation levels of H3K9 or H3K56 in the PGC-1α gene promoter using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay (Figure S6B). These data indicate that decreased PGC-1α expression in the brown fat of SIRT6<sup>ad−/−</sup> mice cannot be attributed to changes in the acetylation levels of H3K9 or H3K56 of its promoter region.

The adaptive thermogenesis in BAT in response to cold is largely due to a hypothalamus-driven increase in sympathetic tone, which activates the β-adrenergic receptor-cAMP-PKA signaling pathway, ultimately inducing UCP1 levels ([Jimenez et al., 2002; Thomas and Palmiter, 1997](https://doi.org/10.1038/nm0702-795)). cAMP signaling activates the phosphorylation of ATF2, subsequently promoting binding to the promoter of PGC-1α to induce its expression ([Cao et al., 2004](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M312837200)). The present study showed that total or phosphorylated ATF2 (p-ATF2) levels in SIRT6<sup>ad-/</sup> mice were comparable to those in control mice (Figure 6A). However, SIRT6 deficiency reduced p-ATF2 binding to the PGC-1α promoter region containing the cAMP response element (CRE) under both room temperature and cold exposure conditions (Figure 6B). Consistent with the preceding data, the stimulatory effect of cold exposure on thermogenesis in BAT was inhibited in SIRT6<sup>ad-/</sup> mice (Figures 6C and 6D). The depletion of SIRT6 in primary adipocytes reduced p-ATF2 binding to PGC-1α promoter; however, coinfection with Ad-SIRT6 restored p-ATF2 binding to PGC-1α promoter (Figures 6E and 6F). Conversely, overexpression of SIRT6 in WT primary brown adipocytes promoted p-ATF2 binding to the PGC-1α promoter region in the isoproterenol-stimulated state (Figures 6G and 6H).

The luciferase reporter gene assay indicated that the overexpression of either WT or mutant (H133Y) SIRT6 significantly stimulated the activity of PGC-1α gene promoter (Figure 6I). Consistently, mutant SIRT6 has effects on the mRNA and protein levels of thermogenic genes, including PGC-1α and UCP1, and the OCR in primary brown adipocytes that are similar to those

of WT SIRT6 (Figures S7A–S7C). Correspondingly, both WT and mutant SIRT6 promoted p-ATF2 binding to the promoter region of PGC-1α in brown adipocytes but did not affect p-ATF2 or total ATF2 protein levels (Figures S7D and S7E). These results suggest SIRT6 enzymatic activity is not essential in terms of PGC-1α activation. Rather, SIRT6 may act as an adaptor protein, recruiting p-ATF2 proteins to PGC-1α gene promoter, in terms of the regulation of PGC-1α.

SIRT6 is reported to be a constitutively chromatin-associated protein prominently localized to actively transcribing genomic loci (Ram et al., 2011). We confirmed binding of SIRT6 to proximal promoter regions of PGC-1α, but less binding to its distal promoter region was observed (Figure 6J). Because both SIRT6 and p-ATF2 bind to the PGC-1α gene promoter, we examined whether SIRT6 and p-ATF2 form a complex in vivo. Coimmunoprecipitation assay confirmed a weak interaction between SIRT6 and p-ATF2 in the BAT of control mice under room temperature; however, exposure to 4°C for 2 hr markedly enhanced the interaction of these proteins (Figure 6K). Furthermore, the interaction of endogenous SIRT6 and p-ATF2 was detectable in primary WT brown adipocytes but disappeared in SIRT6-deficient adipocyte (Figure S6C). Moreover, the

immunoprecipitation of exogenous SIRT6-FLAG fusion protein with anti-FLAG antibody pulled down endogenous p-ATF2 in primary brown adipocytes (Figure S6D). These data suggest the specificity of the interaction between SIRT6 and p-ATF2.

We also performed ChIP assay to detect PGC-1α recruitment to the PPAR response element (PPRE) of the UCP1 promoter. In control brown fat, PGC-1α proteins occupy the promoter of UCP1 containing PPRE. SIRT6 deficiency decreased PGC-1α binding to the UCP1 promoter in BAT (Figure 6L), consistent with decreased PGC-1α expression in SIRT6<sup>ad−/−</sup> mice (Figures 3I and 6D).

Finally, because SIRT6 is reported to induce PGC-1α acetylation in the liver by directly interacting with and enhancing GCN5 activity (Dominy et al., 2012), we examined whether SIRT6 deficiency influences PGC-1α acetylation levels. However, when comparing the same amounts of PGC-1α protein levels, we did not observe a marked difference in PGC-1α acetylation in brown fat between SIRT6<sup>ad−/−</sup> and control mice (Figure S6E). Thus, SIRT6 is not a major deacetylase for PGC-1α in BAT.

Based on these data, we proposed that SIRT6 regulates PGC-1α expression by interacting with and promoting p-ATF2 binding to its promoter region. SIRT6 deficiency reduces p-ATF2 binding to and activation of PGC-1α expression, subsequently decreasing the thermogenic program of brown fat and leading to obesity (Figure 7).

### DISCUSSION

Studies have previously shown that global SIRT6 KO mice have severe metabolic defects, including a complete loss of subcutaneous fat and acute onset of hypoglycemia (Mostoslavsky et al., 2006). However, the liver or neural-specific SIRT6 KO mice do not display hypoglycemia or loss of subcutaneous fat (Kim et al., 2010; Schwer et al., 2010). Thus, we hypothesized that SIRT6 deficiency in adipose tissue might lead to these metabolic defects. To test this hypothesis, we generated fat-specific SIRT6 KO mice. Surprisingly, these mice are obese and have increased blood glucose levels, contrasting what we expected. Thus, hypoglycemia and reduced adiposity in global SIRT6 KO mice may be secondary effects resulting from other serious diseases induced by the loss of SIRT6.

Kim et al. (2010) reported that the liver-specific disruption of SIRT6 in mice causes fatty liver, which also occurred in the fat SIRT6-deficient mouse model used in the present study. The aP2-cre line does not induce recombination in the liver (Lee et al., 2013; Martens et al., 2010). Consistently, hepatic SIRT6 protein levels were not altered in the SIRT6<sup>ad−/−</sup> mouse model used in the present study. These data suggest that the

fatty liver phenotype in SIRT6<sup>ad−/−</sup> mice cannot be attributed to non-specific inactivation of hepatic SIRT6.

Neural-specific SIRT6-deleted mice have also been generated (Schwer et al., 2010). These neural SIRT6 mutant mice initially displayed postnatal growth retardation but became indistinguishable from control mice when 6–7 weeks of age. Adult neural SIRT6 mutant mice had markedly smaller brains than controls (Schwer et al., 2010). These phenotypes are distinct from what we observed in SIRT6<sup>ad−/−</sup> mice. The sizes of the brains of fat SIRT6 mutant mice were indistinguishable from those of control mice (data not shown). Furthermore, we did not detect differences in brain SIRT6 protein levels between SIRT6<sup>ad−/−</sup> and control mice. Whether the aP2-Cre line leads to the germline recombination of floxed alleles in the nervous system remains undetermined (Martens et al., 2010; Lee et al., 2013). Thus, the phenotype of SIRT6<sup>ad−/−</sup> mice in the present study is unlikely to have resulted from the inactivation of neural SIRT6.

Analyses of primary adipocytes confirmed that the effects of SIRT6 on thermogenesis are cell autonomous. Collectively, these data suggest that the phenotype in SIRT6<sup>ad−/−</sup> mice primarily results from a SIRT6 deficiency in fat. However, the aP2-cre mouse line may result in target gene recombination in certain endothelial cells and macrophages. We cannot rule out the possibility that SIRT6 deficiency in macrophages or other cell types contributes to the phenotype of SIRT6<sup>ad−/−</sup> mice.

Fat SIRT6-deleted mice display a remarkable whitening phenotype of brown fat, indicating that SIRT6 regulates the thermogenic function of brown adipocytes. Similar to brown adipocytes, beige adipocytes have a thermogenic function in response to cold exposure and make an important contribution to whole-body energy metabolism (Cohen et al., 2014; Ohno et al., 2012; Seale et al., 2007, 2011; Wu et al., 2012). In the present study, SIRT6 deficiency impaired the browning of subcutaneous WAT induced by cold exposure or the β3-adrenergic agonist, suggesting that SIRT6 is also essential for maintaining the development and function of beige fat. Moreover, fat SIRT6-deficient mice exhibited cold intolerance and a defect in non-shivering adaptive thermogenesis. We cannot rule out a defect in shivering thermogenesis in these mice, although we did not observe pronounced shivering.

We also showed that fat SIRT6 expression was markedly decreased in obese subjects compared to lean subjects, implying that decreased SIRT6 expression is a potential factor leading to obesity. Only limited subjects were recruited in the present study, and more human fat samples are required to confirm this result.

Both SIRT1 and SIRT6 are positive regulators of the browning of WAT. However, SIRT1 does not affect the identity and thermogenic function of brown adipocytes (Qiang et al., 2012), in

### Generation of Fat Tissue-Specific KO Mice and Diets

All animal experiments were performed according to procedures approved by the Animal Research Committee at the Institute of Laboratory Animals, Chinese Academy of Medical Science and Peking Union Medical College. Mice were housed and maintained on a 12 hr light-dark cycle at constant temperature (23°C). Food and water were available ad libitum. For DIO studies, mice were fed an HFD (D12492; Research Diets). SIRT6<sup>flox/flox</sup> mice and Fabp4-Cre mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratory. SIRT6<sup>flox/flox</sup> mice were backcrossed with C57BL/6 mice more than eight times. To generate mice with adipose tissue-specific KO of SIRT6, SIRT6<sup>flox/flox</sup> mice were crossed with Fabp4-Cre; SIRT6<sup>flox/+</sup> mice to obtain Fabp4-Cre; SIRT6<sup>flox/flox</sup> mice. The SIRT6<sup>flox/flox</sup> littermates were used as controls. For experiments, age-matched male mice between 2 and 4 months were used unless specifically noted.

### Statistical Analyses

Data are presented as mean ± SEM. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software (v.20) or GraphPad Prism (v.6.0c). Statistical significance was defined as p < 0.05 and determined by two-tailed Student’s t tests (for comparison of two experimental conditions) or ANOVA (for comparison of three or more experimental conditions). The number of animals used for each experiment is indicated in the figure legends. For cell studies, data are representative of at least three independent experiments.
