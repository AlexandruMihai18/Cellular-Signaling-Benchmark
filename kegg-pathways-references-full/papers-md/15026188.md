the adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) (Waterman and Simson, 1989), and the expression of the CYP11B2 gene is mainly controlled by the renin–angiotensin system (Quinn and Williams, 1988). Angiotensin II and potassium increase the production levels of CYP11B2, but aldosterone synthesis is

deficiencies. These disorders lead to decreased sodium re-
sorption and potassium secretion to the urine. The plasma
renin activity is elevated and the plasma levels of aldos-
terone precursors are elevated. All patients suffered in
infancy from failure to thrive. The mutation Thr185Ile has
been found in a boy suffering from aldosterone synthase
deficiency (Peter et al.,

truncated in vivo the accompanying increased electron transfer ability of the truncated Adx could lead to regulatory relevance in a way that the respective adrenal glands would secrete more aldosterone (Uhlmann et al., 1994). However, it is not known whether the truncated species of Adx are artefacts or whether physiological conditions leading to a changed electron flow in adrenal tissue do occur.

Taken together, the results obtained
