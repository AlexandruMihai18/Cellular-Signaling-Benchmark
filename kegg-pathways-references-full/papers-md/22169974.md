Epithelial cell polarity, stem cells and cancer

**Fernando Martin-Belmonte**¹ **and Mirna Perez-Moreno**²

Abstract | After years of extensive scientific discovery much has been learned about the networks that regulate epithelial homeostasis. Loss of expression or functional activity of cell adhesion and cell polarity proteins (including the PAR, crumbs (CRB) and scribble (SCRIB) complexes) is intricately related to advanced stages of tumour progression and invasiveness. But the key roles of these proteins in crosstalk with the Hippo and liver kinase B1 (LKB1)–AMPK pathways and in epithelial function and proliferation indicate that they may also be associated with the early stages of tumorigenesis. For example, deregulation of adhesion and polarity proteins can cause misoriented cell divisions and increased self-renewal of adult epithelial stem cells. In this Review, we highlight some advances in the understanding of how loss of epithelial cell polarity contributes to tumorigenesis.

The development of solid tumours comprises a complex succession of intrinsic and extrinsic events that prompt cells to proliferate out of control and to acquire migratory and invasive capabilities¹. Whereas several studies have undoubtedly revealed that the loss of epithelial cell polarity is intricately connected to the malignant progression of incipient cancer cells, accumulating evidence has unmasked the crucial roles of regulators of polarity in the early stages of tumorigenesis. Epithelial cell polarity is fundamental for tissue function, and it has been conventionally defined as ‘asymmetry’ within cells and epithelial tissues². This denotes not only a differential positioning of membrane domains and organelles along the apical-basolateral axis, known as apical-basolateral polarity, but also the positioning of cells in the plane of epithelial tissues, known as planar cell polarity³. In this Review, we focus on the mechanisms that regulate the apical-basolateral polarity of epithelial cells, which more clearly contributes to cancer.

Apical-basolateral polarity is characterized by the existence of non-coalescent apical and basolateral plasma membrane domains, which have a differential composition of proteins and lipids. Both simple and stratified epithelia comprise a single layer of dividing cells in which the basal domain is attached to the underlying basement membrane. In simple epithelia, such as the intestinal lining, the apical membrane faces the luminal space, and it is distinguished by the presence of microvilli and a primary cilium⁴. In stratified epithelia, such as the epidermis, the uppermost layers face the external environment and function as a barrier, although apical and basolateral determinants have been identified in progenitor cells of the basal layer of the epidermis⁵.

Apical-basolateral polarity contributes to the acquisition of cell shape and to the directional transport that characterizes epithelial function, but how is the loss of epithelial polarity associated with tumorigenesis? Cell polarization allows cells to sense and to elicit the proper spatiotemporal responses to cues that arise from neighbouring cells and the surrounding microenvironment². Thus, when polarity is disrupted, cells may become unresponsive to growth inhibitory signals and may circumvent differentiation, senescence or apoptosis. Interestingly, several proteins that regulate apical-basolateral polarity are well-known tumour suppressors and proto-oncoproteins. They also exhibit crosstalk with signalling pathways that control cell growth and proliferation, including WNT, Hedgehog and Hippo pathways, and mTOR-dependent energy metabolism. Additionally, through their connections with the cytoskeleton, their loss is fundamentally associated with alterations in epithelial functions, such as loss of vectorial transport and tissue architecture, and mitotic defects that may lead to the generation of genomic instability. Interestingly, during mitosis, cell polarity mechanisms are also involved in the control of oriented divisions of epithelial stem cells within the tissues. This is particularly important, as evidence suggests that stem cells can be the cell-of-origin for a range of solid tumours.

In this Review, we highlight advances in understanding the establishment and maintenance of epithelial cell polarity and the associated implications for cancer. We

REVIEW S

At a glance
- The proteins that finely control epithelial cell polarity are known as tumour suppressors or proto-oncoproteins. Loss of epithelial cell polarity — through deregulation of these proteins — is crucial for cancer cell invasion and advanced tumour progression. Accumulating evidence indicates that epithelial cell polarity cues and polarized cell divisions causally contribute to restrict carcinoma formation.
- Cell polarity proteins crosstalk with signalling pathways that regulate cell growth and proliferation, including the WNT and Hippo pathways, and liver kinase B1 (LKB1)–mTOR-dependent energy metabolism.
- The components of the evolutionarily conserved Hippo pathway function as important tumour suppressors. Recent studies have provided evidence that the cell polarity regulators lethal (2) giant larvae homologue (LGL; also known as LLGL), atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) and crumbs homologue (CRB), and the adherens junction components E-cadherin–α-catenin or E-cadherin–β-catenin regulate the Hippo pathway in mammalian and *Drosophila melanogaster* epithelial cells.
- The LKB1–AMPK–mTOR pathway, which is a molecular link between polarity and the metabolic status of a cell, is essential in the process of tumorigenesis.
- The maintenance of most adult epithelial tissues relies on the presence of polarized stem cells, which self-renew through symmetric cell divisions. During differentiation stem cells reorient their mitotic spindles and divide asymmetrically in order to generate the specialized cells that drive epithelial function and homeostasis. The genes that control epithelial cell polarity also regulate spindle orientation and the symmetry of cell divisions in stem cells.
- Epithelial tumours are highly heterogeneous, and the cell-of-origin that can initiate tumorigenesis is an area of extensive study. Two theories of tumour initiation have been postulated; one proposes that some tumours arise from normal adult stem or progenitor cells that have gone awry, and the other postulates that they arise from differentiated cells that acquire self-renewal capabilities. Evidence for the stem or progenitor cell-of-origin model has been provided for some carcinomas or specific subtypes of carcinomas; however, this seems to be unlikely or has not been well defined for several others.

polarity complexes have been identified to date: the PAR polarity complex, comprising PAR3, PAR6, atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) and cell division control protein 42 (CDC42), which promotes the establishment of the apical-basal membrane border; the crumbs (CRB) complex, which is formed by the transmembrane protein CRB and the associated cytoplasmic proteins PALS1 (also known as MPP5) and PALS1-associated tight junction protein (PATJ; also known as INADL), which is required to establish the apical membrane; and the scribble homologue (SCRIB)–lethal (2) giant larvae homologue (LGL; also known as LLGL)–discs-large homologue (DLG) complex, which defines the basolateral plasma domain<sup>9</sup> (FIG. 1).

Protein networks that establish the apical and basolateral domains. Epithelial cells orient their basal surface through the adhesion of integrin receptors to the extracellular matrix, and they extend membrane protrusions, known as filopodia, to contact neighbouring cells and so allow the formation of cohesive layers of cells<sup>10</sup>. At the initial stages of intercellular adhesion, nectin–afadin adhesion complexes associate with PAR3 (REFS 11, 12) (FIG. 1). This is followed by the recruitment of E-cadherin and junctional adhesion molecule A (JAMA) to the cell cortex, which cluster these primordial adhesion sites, known as puncta<sup>13,14</sup>, into adhesive homophilic interactions. These primordial adhesions contain a mixture of adherens junction and tight junction proteins<sup>12,15</sup>, and through their anchoring to the actin cytoskeleton and through RHO-GTPase activity, they extend the interface of adhesion along the basolateral domain<sup>16,17</sup>.

Next, adherens junction-associated proteins are separated from tight junction-associated proteins and the adherens junction belt-like structure and mature tight junctions are formed. This requires the exclusion of PAR3 from primordial adhesions through the localized activation of RAC1 GTPase. Interestingly, PAR3 binds and recruits to these sites T lymphoma invasion and metastasis-inducing protein 1 (TIAM1; a RAC1 GTPase guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF)), which promotes the exclusion of TIAM1 from the subapical sites where it modulates RAC1 activity<sup>18,19</sup>. aPKC (PKCζ and PKCλ in humans) is then recruited to subapical PAR3–PAR6 complexes, and phosphorylates and excludes PAR3 from tight junction sites, allowing tight junction formation and the separation of the apical and subapical domains<sup>20,21</sup>. In *Drosophila melanogaster*, the separation of the apical domain from the most apical region of the basolateral domain presents many similarities to the polarization of mammalian cells<sup>22–25</sup>.

The SCRIB–LGL–DLG complex localizes with adherens junctions in mammals and with septate junctions in *D. melanogaster* and promotes basolateral membrane identity<sup>26–28</sup>. This complex controls the expansion of the apical domain; LGL competes with PAR3, sequestering the PAR complex from the apical membrane. LGL phosphorylation by aPKC and the phosphorylation of PAR3 by PAR1 (also known as MARK2) inhibit this interaction and promote the separation of the lateral domains and subapical domains<sup>29–31</sup>. The apical membrane is

### Vectorial transport
The transportation of ions or molecules within a polarized cell across an epithelium in a specific direction.

### Tight junctions
A type of intercellular junction, which is comprised of several interconnecting integral plasma membrane proteins that are anchored to the cytoskeleton. They link adjacent plasma membranes of neighbouring cells to limit the movement of proteins and lipids between the apical and lateral plasma membrane domains and the intercellular passage of molecules.

### Cell cortex
A cytoplasmic region under the inner face of the plasma membrane that forms a contractile, mesh-like structure that is rich in contractile actin-myosin filaments (termed cortical actin filaments) and spectrin filaments.

### The establishment of epithelial cell polarity
The mechanisms that promote the establishment of epithelial cell polarity are not completely understood, and can vary between different mammalian epithelial cells and model organisms. In simple epithelia, the formation of polarized cohesive cell layers that form the body compartments mainly depends on cell adhesion complexes and epithelial cell polarity complexes. Two intercellular adhesion complexes, known as adherens junctions and tight junctions, form part of the apical junctional complex and contribute to the formation and the maintenance of apical and basolateral domains<sup>6,7</sup> (BOX 1). This differs in neuroepithelial cells, which do not have classical tight junctions, and in stratified epithelia, such as the epidermis, in which tight junctions are maintained in the upper granular layer. At the root of the establishment of the polarity of simple epithelial cells lies a finely tuned interplay between adherens junctions, tight junctions and cell polarity complexes; and in neuroepithelial cells and the epidermis, some parallels of these molecular interactions also take place.

The cell polarity complexes, which were originally identified in model organisms such as yeast, worms and flies, are highly evolutionarily conserved<sup>8</sup>. Three major

Adhesive homophilic interactions  
Adhesive interactions in which the interacting molecules are of the same type. Also known as homotypic interactions.

Subapical  
A plasma membrane domain that is spatially separated between the apical and basolateral domains. It is thought to coordinate molecular pathways, such as endocytic pathways and sorting machinery between these distinct plasma membrane domains.

Septate junctions  
Intercellular junctions of invertebrate epithelia that act as a barrier restricting the diffusion of proteins and lipids between the apical and lateral plasma membrane domains and the intercellular passage of molecules.

characterized by the presence of microvilli, in which there is a meshwork of actin and spectrin filaments linked to the membrane by the ezrin, radixin and moesin (ERM) family of proteins³². The tumour suppressor merlin (also known as NF2) has homology to the ERM family members. Merlin has also been implicated in promoting the establishment of adherens junctions and the development of the epidermis³³. Additionally, merlin associates with tight junctions through its interaction with angiomotin (AMOT)-PATJ and PALS1, which provides junctional stability³⁴.

The continued expression and functional activity of adherens junctions, tight junctions, merlin and cell polarity complexes are required for polarized cells to remain tightly associated within the epithelium and to coordinate signalling pathways that regulate epithelial proliferation. The loss of constituents of adherens junctions and tight junctions, as well as merlin, is associated with depolarization, loss of differentiated characteristics, enhanced epithelial cell proliferation and the acquisition of invasive potential³⁴⁻³⁹. Furthermore, loss of cell polarity complexes leads to intercellular adhesion breakage, loss of polarized characteristics and hyperproliferation⁹,⁴⁰,⁴¹. This can occur through various alterations, including overexpression, downregulation, mislocalization, deletion and alternative splicing⁴². In addition, several key transcription factors that promote

epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) directly regulate the expression of both cell adhesion and cell polarity complex proteins⁴³.

## The polarity complexes in cancer

In humans, SCRIB is a potential tumour suppressor, the expression of which is frequently lost in advanced tumours⁴³ (TABLE 1; see Supplementary information S1 (table)). SCRIB is also frequently mislocalized owing to the loss of E-cadherin, which is required for the localization of SCRIB at the basolateral plasma membrane²⁸. Similarly, loss-of-function mutations in Scrib in eye-antennal discs in *D. melanogaster* lead to the formation of metastatic tumours through a mechanism that involves the oncoprotein RAS. These tumours also have activated JUN N-terminal kinase (JNK) signalling, and present similar characteristics to human cancers that lack SCRIB, including basement membrane degradation, loss of E-cadherin expression, and migration, invasion and secondary tumour formation⁴⁴,⁴⁵. Whereas JNK activity normally promotes the apoptosis of SCRIB-deficient cells, it becomes a driver of cellular overgrowth, tumorigenesis and invasion in the presence of oncogenically activated RAS or Notch signalling⁴⁶. Recently, *in vivo* and *in vitro* findings have shown that the loss of SCRIB inhibits apoptosis and enhances transformation through the MYC proto-oncoprotein in three-dimensional (3D) cultures of

**Box 1 | The biology of cellular junctions and their role in cell polarity**

Adherens junctions and tight junctions participate in the establishment and maintenance of apical-basal polarity in simple epithelia. The major structural components of adherens junctions and tight junctions are shown in the figure. At the core of adherens junctions are two adhesive complexes: cadherin–catenin and nectin–afadin complexes¹⁸³. Classical cadherins mediate homophilic calcium-dependent cell–cell adhesions through their extracellular domains, which link cells to each other. The cytoplasmic tails of cadherins bind, through different domains, to β-catenin (β-cat) and to p120-catenin (p120). In turn, β-catenin binds to monomeric α-catenin (α-cat) that indirectly anchors the cadherin–catenin complexes to the actin cytoskeleton through interactions with actin-binding proteins (actin BPs). The α-catenin dimer preferentially binds actin filaments¹⁸⁴. Additionally, β-catenin binds to the microtubule motor dynein¹⁶⁸, and p120-catenin connects cadherin–catenin complexes to microtubules¹⁷⁴. The cytoplasmic domain of nectin interacts with afadin (also known as AF6), which binds to actin and RAS- and RAP-family GTPases (not shown). The cytoplasmic domain of nectin also interacts with other actin-binding proteins such as the tight junction protein zonula occludens 1 (ZO1) and α-catenin. Tight junctions localize apically to adherens junctions, and distribute at the border of the apical and basolateral domain, where they function to restrict the movement of proteins and lipids between these membrane domains. These junctions also function as a barrier by dynamically sealing the space between neighbouring cells¹⁸⁵. The tight junction transmembrane proteins occludin, claudin, tricellulin (not shown) and junctional adhesion molecule (JAM) bind through their cytoplasmic domain to several intracellular scaffolding proteins, including ZO1–3, multi-PDZ domain protein 1 (MUPP1) and cingulin (not shown)¹⁸⁶.

Figure 1 | Establishment of epithelial cell polarity. Three major polarity complexes participate in the establishment of apical-basal polarity: the crumbs (CRB) complex (shown in red) is required to establish the apical membrane and is formed of the transmembrane protein CRB and the associated cytoplasmic proteins PALS1 and PALS1-associated tight junction protein (PATJ). The PAR complex (shown in blue) promotes the establishment of the apical-lateral membrane border and comprises PAR3, PAR6, atypical protein kinase C (aPKC; PKCζ and PKCι in humans) and cell division control 42 (CDC42). The scribble (SCRIB)-lethal (2) giant larvae homologue (LGL)-discs large homologue (DLG) complex (shown in orange) defines the basolateral plasma membrane domain ${ }^{130,187-191}$. These three complexes have antagonistic interactions and spatiotemporally regulate epithelial polarization through their interactions with the cytoskeleton and adhesion proteins. At early stages of cell polarization, PAR3 binds to afadin, and these primordial adhesions mature to form the belt-like adhesion junctions and tight junctions that localize at the apical-basal membrane border. This involves aPKC activity and the exclusion of PAR3 from primordial adhesions at intermediate stages of polarization. This is followed by PAR3 exclusion from both the PAR6–aPKC and CRB complexes to establish the apical-lateral border and the apical membrane; whereas, the SCRIB complex defines the basolateral plasma membrane domain by antagonizing the PAR and CRB complexes, which restricts their activity and hence the expansion of the apical domain ${ }^{9,41,188,192}$.

Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). A process through which cells transit from a polarized, epithelial phenotype to a highly motile mesenchymal phenotype. EMT causes pronounced morphological and functional changes in cells, such as loss of epithelial adherens junctions, reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and loss of apical-basal polarity.

human epithelial cells ${ }^{47}$. This involves the interaction at cellular junctions of SCRIB with the β-PIX (also known as ARHGEF7)-GIT1 complex, which is a GEF for RAC1, the expression of which is induced by MYC. In turn, RAC1 activation stimulates a JNK-JUN-BCL-2-interacting mediator of cell death (BIM; also known as BCL2L11) signalling pathway. Therefore, reductions in the expression or mislocalization of SCRIB are able to block apoptosis and stimulate tumorigenesis. Finally, SCRIB is downregulated or mislocalized in human breast tumours and transgenic mouse mammary tumours ${ }^{47}$. The deregulation of SCRIB in mammary epithelial cells disrupts cell polarity, blocks apoptosis and drives the formation of breast tumours when MYC is oncogenically activated ${ }^{47}$.

Interestingly, the role of SCRIB in tumorigenesis seems to be dependent on cell context: in some cases it induces cell migration through the activation of RAC1, whereas in others it has been associated with restricting invasion and metastasis ${ }^{48,49}$. The molecular mechanisms that regulate these contrary functions are starting to be elucidated. It has been shown that SCRIB restricts HRAS-G12V-mediated invasiveness of a human breast epithelial cell line through the direct binding of ERK and the consequent inhibition of its phosphorylation and thereby the inhibition of the RAF-MEK-ERK pathway ${ }^{50}$. Indeed, loss of SCRIB results in increased levels and nuclear translocation of phospho-ERK ${ }^{51}$.

The other components of the SCRIB complexes, LGL and DLG, are also tumour suppressors that promote the acquisition of invasiveness when their expression is modified. The EMT-associated transcription factor zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1) represses the expression of several polarity proteins, including LGL2, in breast and colorectal cancers, which is associated with a substantial reduction of cell polarity and the induction of metastasis ${ }^{52,53}$. Similarly, the re-expression of LGL2 in melanoma cells restored cell adhesion and restricted invasion ${ }^{54}$. A recent study in zebrafish showed that Lgl2 regulates Erbb signalling in epidermal carcinomas. Loss of Lgl2 induced the activation of Erbb signalling, impaired the formation of hemidesmosomes and induced the mislocalization of E-cadherin, leading to the induction of EMT; pathways involved in proliferation were also activated ${ }^{55}$. Another mechanism associated with LGL loss-of-function in oncogenesis is alternative splicing. Aberrant splice variants of $L L G L 1$ (which encodes LGL1) have been described in hepatocellular carcinoma ${ }^{56}$. The majority of these transcripts were found to encode truncated proteins lacking one or more conserved WD-40 repeat motifs and which were therefore unlikely to be functional.

The CRB tumour suppressor was originally identified in $D$. melanogaster as a regulator of epithelial cell polarity. CRB3, the human orthologue of CRB, also has a fundamental function in the establishment of polarity in mammalian epithelial cells, and in the morphogenesis of 3D cultures of epithelial cells. CRB3 is a tumour suppressor during the transformation and progression of mammalian epithelial cells ${ }^{57}$. Further evidence was obtained from observations of immortal embryonic mouse kidney epithelial cells selected *in vivo* to have acquired tumorigenic capabilities. CRB3 expression was substantially repressed in these cells, which had impaired tight junction formation and loss of apical-basal polarity and contact inhibition. Re-expression of CRB3 restrained cell migration and metastatic potential *in vivo* ${ }^{57}$. The molecular mechanisms by which CRB3 exerts its tumour suppressor functions may be related to its interactions with the Hippo pathway (discussed below).

Mutations in members of the PAR complex have not been directly associated with tumour formation or progression. However, they seem to cooperate with oncogenes or tumour suppressors in different epithelial cancers (TABLE 1; see Supplementary information S1 (table)). Hence, some signalling pathways that are usually modified in cancer have been found to regulate cell polarity, apoptosis and growth in a coordinated manner ${ }^{40,58}$. ERBB2, a member of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family that is localized in the basolateral membrane, is involved in cell proliferation during normal development in different tissues and wound healing ${ }^{59}$. However, ERBB2 overexpression, which causes partial mislocalization of ERBB2 to the apical domain, is observed in different epithelial cancers ${ }^{42}$. Apically localized ERBB2 binds to PAR6-aPKC and sequesters this complex away from PAR3, which disrupts PAR complex formation at tight junctions,

compromises tight junction integrity and thus disrupts apical-basal polarity ${ }^{60}$. However, recent studies have shown that the expression of PAR6C (also known as PAR6α) alone induces cell proliferation and the development of hyperplastic 3D acini in mammary epithelial cells independently of EGF and through the activation of the MEK–ERK signalling pathway, and without affecting apical-basal polarity ${ }^{61}$. This could be explained by previous studies that have shown that transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) signals to the PAR complex to control epithelial cell morphology and transformation ${ }^{62,63}$. TGFβ is a key regulator of EMT in tumour formation ${ }^{64}$, which promotes invasion and metastasis in advanced carcinomas ${ }^{58}$.

Accumulating evidence demonstrates that human aPKC (PKCζ and PKCi) are oncoproteins the expression of which is frequently elevated in several human epithelial cancers, including lung, liver, breast, pancreas, ovarian, prostate and colon, which usually correlates with poor prognosis ${ }^{65}$. On a mechanistic level, it has been demonstrated that aPKC functions downstream of RAS signalling and upstream of RAC1, in lung and colon carcinogenesis ${ }^{66,67}$; aPKC in $D$. melanogaster tumour models signals through the JNK pathway ${ }^{68}$.

In summary, polarity complexes do exhibit alterations in cancer that drive tumorigenesis but they are predominantly associated with tumour progression. However, crosstalk between polarity complexes and other signalling pathways seems to drive tumorigenesis (TABLE 2; see Supplementary information S2 (table)).

## The Hippo tumour suppressor pathway

The components of the Hippo pathway function as important tumour suppressors ${ }^{69,70}$ that regulate tissue growth by promoting cell cycle exit and apoptosis ${ }^{71,72}$. Recent data from mammals and $D$. melanogaster have linked this pathway with cell polarity proteins in the regulation of tissue growth ${ }^{73-76}$, limiting organ size ${ }^{77}$ and participating in tissue regeneration ${ }^{78-83}$ (FIG. 2).

Regarding the link between cell polarity, the Hippo pathway and cancer, recent studies in the developing $D$. melanogaster eye and imaginal disc epithelia have shown that LGL, aPKC and CRB regulate proliferation and survival by controlling the activity of the Hippo pathway ${ }^{74,75,84,85}$ (FIG. 2). These findings may explain why alterations in polarity complex proteins are linked to proliferation and overgrowth, which has also been observed in mammals. The CRB polarity complex interacts with the transcription factors yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) and TAZ (also known as WWTR1), which are the mammalian homologues of Yorkie in the $D$. melanogaster Hippo pathway. CRB in turn transmits cell density information, which is transmitted through the localization of CRB to the apical domain upon acquisition of polarized junctions and membrane domains, by promoting YAP1-TAZ phosphorylation and consequently cytoplasmic retention, which suppresses TGFβ signalling. TAZ functions as a SMAD nuclear retention factor, and the Hippo pathway links TAZ-YAP1 regulation to cell density, raising the possibility that TGFβ-SMAD signalling might be coupled to cell density-sensing through the Hippo

pathway. Disruption of the CRB complex enhances TGFβ signalling and predisposes cells to TGFβ-mediated EMT<sup>76</sup>, and therefore to late-stage transformation. In addition, the E-cadherin–catenin adhesion complex functions as an upstream regulator of the Hippo signalling pathway in mammalian tissues and cells through the control of YAP1–TAZ activity and localization<sup>86–88</sup>.

In human cancers, the most prevalent mechanism for Hippo pathway inactivation is epigenetic silencing<sup>70</sup>. In fact, hypermethylation of RASSF (RASSF1A and RASSF2A), the human HPO homologues STK4 (which encodes MST1), STK3 (which encodes MST2) and the human Warts homologues LATS1 and LATS2 (REFS 89–91) has been found in various different epithelial cancers.

a potential new mechanism of crosstalk between cell polarity complexes and the Hippo pathway.

Merlin function is associated with various signalling pathways, including RAS, RAC1 and PI3K⁹⁴. In fact, merlin-organized complexes prevent mitogenic signalling and mediate contact-dependent inhibition of proliferation, although the connections between merlin and these pathways with growth control and oncogenic transformation needs further investigation. It was recently shown that the depletion of Nf2 induced hepatocellular carcinoma and bile duct tumours in mice³⁹,⁹⁵. Loss-of-function mutations in the core Hippo pathway also produced tumours specifically in these two organs⁹⁶,⁹⁷, demonstrating the crosstalk between merlin and the Hippo pathway in tumorigenesis. Additionally, phenotypes in multiple tissues caused by merlin deficiency were largely suppressed by heterozygous deletion of Yap1, suggesting that YAP1 is a major effector of merlin in growth regulation⁹⁵. In conclusion, emerging evidence shows that the Hippo pathway is regulated by cell polarity, cell adhesion and cell junction proteins. Hence, cell polarity and cell adhesion proteins seem to modulate organ size control and regeneration through the Hippo pathway.

## The tumour suppressor LKB1 in cell polarity

Cancer cells have limited access to metabolites for energy production, and the involvement of signalling pathways that regulate energy production is crucial in tumorigenesis, as it is during development. Because the liver kinase B1 (LKB1; also known as STK11) pathway is a molecular link that connects polarity and the metabolic status of a cell, it has been proposed that this crosstalk could be essential in tumorigenesis. LKB1 is a master serine/threonine kinase that phosphorylates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and at least 13 other related kinases in response to modifications in the intracellular energy levels⁹⁸. In turn, AMPK phosphorylates various substrates to control glucose and lipid metabolism. STK11 was identified as a tumour suppressor gene the loss of which is associated with the cancer predisposition disorder Peutz–Jeghers syndrome (PJS)⁹⁹. STK11 is also commonly mutated (and inactivated) in different sporadic carcinomas, mainly in the lungs¹⁰⁰, and has more recently been found in 20% of cervical carcinomas¹⁰¹ (TABLE 2; see Supplementary information S2 (table)). The tumorigenic potential of LKB1 is increased when other oncogenes are expressed, such as KRAS, SRC or MYC¹⁰²⁻¹⁰⁴, or when tumour suppressors are simultaneously deleted, such as PTEN.

Studies of LKB1 have uncovered novel signalling pathways that link its role in metabolism and growth to cell polarity¹⁰⁵ (FIG. 3). In Caenorhabditis elegans and D. melanogaster, the function of PAR4, the orthologue of LKB1, was initially connected to the regulation of cell polarity. PAR4 is required for the first asymmetric divisions during the early stages of embryonic development and for anterior-posterior axis determination in D. melanogaster oocytes¹⁰⁶,¹⁰⁷.

Figure 3 | LKB1 regulates epithelial cell polarity, cell growth and energy metabolism. The role of liver kinase B1 (LKB1) in epithelial polarity is associated with the phosphorylation (P) of serine and threonine residues in different members of the AMP-associated kinase (AMPK) family<sup>98</sup>, including the serine/threonine kinase PAR1, AMPK and mammalian STE20-like protein kinase 4 (MST4). PAR1 phosphorylates PAR3 on two conserved serine residues to generate 14-3-3-binding sites. This inhibits the formation of the PAR3–PAR6–atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) complex by blocking PAR3 oligomerization and binding to aPKC. As PAR1 is associated with the basolateral membrane in epithelial cells, this mechanism is required for PAR3 exclusion in the basolateral region. PAR1 inhibits myosin II in a RHO kinase (ROCK)-dependent manner to promote lateral lumen polarity in MDCK cells independently of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-mediated cell–cell adhesion<sup>202</sup>. Phosphorylation of RAB11–FIP2 by PAR1 controls cellular junction formation<sup>203</sup>. PAR1-mediated phosphorylation of Dishevelled (DVL) regulates its membrane localization, but it is not required for canonical WNT signalling. However, PAR1 is essential for the activation of the canonical WNT pathway, possibly through targets other than DVL<sup>204</sup>. In polarized epithelial cells, E-cadherin (E-cad) regulates AMPK phosphorylation by controlling the localization of the LKB1 complex through binding to STE20-related kinase adaptor-α (STRADα). AMPK is required for tight junction (TJ) formation<sup>112,113</sup>, although it is possible that this activation of AMPK might be mediated by Ca<sup>2+</sup>-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase-β (CAMKKβ)<sup>114,115</sup>. AMPK regulates bile canaliculi formation, TJ formation and polarity maintenance<sup>118,119</sup>. One of the major growth regulatory pathways controlled by LKB1–AMPK is the mTOR pathway. AMPK directly phosphorylates both tuberous sclerosis 2 (TSC2) and regulatory-associated protein of mTOR (RAPTOR) to inhibit mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) activity. AMPK indirectly induces phosphorylation of myosin regulatory light chain 2 (MRLC2) to regulate actomyosin contractility for the establishment of polarity and cell division. AMPK localizes dynamically to the centrosome spindle poles, the central spindle midzone and the midbody, suggesting a potential role in faithful cell division and chromosome segregation during mitosis. LKB1 localizes to the primary cilium and basal body, and fluid flow results in increased AMPK phosphorylation at the basal body and inhibition of the mTOR pathway, which limits cell size. LKB1 also induces apical brush border formation in intestinal cells by phosphorylating MST4, which then activates ezrin. PCP, planar cell polarity.

laboratory showed that on LKB1 activation, single intestinal epithelial cells fully polarize in the absence of junctional cell–cell contacts<sup>108</sup>, which generated substantial attention on this master kinase in the field of cell polarity in vertebrates. The role of LKB1 in epithelial polarity was initially associated with the phosphorylation of the serine/threonine kinase PAR1 in *D. melanogaster*, the mammalian homologue of which is formed by a family of four microtubule-associated protein (MAP) and microtubule affinity-regulating kinases (MARK1–4)<sup>109</sup>.

However, studies have provided evidence that LKB1 might control cell polarity predominantly through AMPK activation, and not through PAR1 (MARK1–4), and this might be the cause of the tumour suppressor function of LKB1 (REFS 110–113). Constitutive activation of AMPK restored many of the defective polarity phenotypes of LKB1-null mutant *D. melanogaster* epithelial cells<sup>110,111</sup>. In addition, two studies using calcium-switch experiments (an *in vitro* assay to analyse cell-junction formation) using monolayers of MDCK epithelial cells showed that AMPK is required for tight junction formation<sup>112,113</sup>, although it

is possible that this activation of AMPK might be mediated by Ca²⁺-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase-β (CAMKKβ; also known as CAMKK2)¹¹⁴,¹¹⁵. This function of LKB1–AMPK might also be associated with E-cadherin-mediated adherens junction formation. In polarized epithelial cells, E-cadherin regulates AMPK phosphorylation by controlling the localization (but not the kinase activity) of LKB1 through the pseudo-kinase STE20-related kinase adaptor-α (STRADα)¹¹⁶. The LKB1 complex therefore seems to function downstream of E-cadherin in tumour suppression (FIG. 3). However, STRADα may not mediate LKB1 function in cell polarity. A recent study of the embryonic development of *C. elegans* has shown that the role of PAR-4 (the orthologue of LKB1) in polarity may be independent of the *strd-1* complex (the *C. elegans* orthologue of STRADα), as PAR-4 in complex with the adaptor protein MOP-25-2 is required for AMPK phosphorylation (*aak-1* and *aak-2* are the *C. elegans* homologues of the AMPK α-catalytic subunit, and *aakb-1* and *aakb-2* are the β-regulatory subunit homologues), whereas the role of PAR-4 in energy metabolism control is dependent on STRD-1 (REF. 117). More recent studies in human hepatic cells have revealed that AMPK and LKB1 also regulate the formation of bile canaliculi in a Ca²⁺-dependent manner, tight junction formation and polarity maintenance¹¹⁸,¹¹⁹, and that the LKB1–AMPK pathway that mediates hepatocyte polarization is activated by bile-acid synthesis¹²⁰, although whether this influences tumorigenesis in hepatocytes is currently unknown.

Downstream of AMPK is the mTOR pathway. mTOR is a central integrator of nutrient and growth factor signalling that is activated by energy stress; it functions to control cell growth in all eukaryotes and is deregulated in most human cancers¹²¹. AMPK phosphorylates both tuberous sclerosis 2 (TSC2; also known as tuberin) and regulatory-associated protein of mTOR (RAPTOR) to inhibit mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) activity, although it remains possible that additional substrates of AMPK contribute to the regulation of mTOR (FIG. 3). Interestingly, mTORC1 is the only signalling pathway downstream of LKB1 characterized so far that seems to be activated in human tumours of the lung with LKB1 mutations and from patients with PJS¹²²,¹²³. However, it seems that the role of LKB1 and AMPK in cell polarity is mediated by the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton through the motor protein myosin II, at least in *D. melanogaster* embryos and in a human colorectal carcinoma cell line¹¹⁰. In this case, AMPK induces, possibly indirectly¹²⁴, the phosphorylation of myosin regulatory light chain 2 (MRLC2; also known as MYL12B) on serine-19 (serine-22 in MLC2 in *D. melanogaster*)¹¹⁰. Myosin II regulates actinomyosin contractility, which is essential for the establishment of polarity and cell division. LKB1 might also regulate the actin cytoskeleton through an AMPK-independent pathway. Specifically, LKB1 induces apical brush border formation in intestinal cells by activating MST4, which then activates ezrin¹²⁵ (FIG. 3).

During all of the stages of mitosis (including cytokinesis), phosphorylated (and thus active) AMPK dynamically localizes to the centrosome spindle poles, the central spindle midzone and the midbody in human cancer-derived epithelial cells, suggesting a potential role of AMPK in faithful chromosome segregation during mitosis¹²⁶. Additionally, a recent study has established a causal relationship between the primary cilium and cell growth through the regulation of the mTOR signalling pathway. Cilia are signalling platforms that protrude as filiform organelles from the plasma membrane, and they act as sensors to detect external fluid flow. LKB1 localizes to the cilium and basal body, and fluid flow results in increased AMPK phosphorylation at the basal body and inhibition of the mTOR pathway and thus control of cell size (FIG. 3). In fact, knockdown of LKB1 results in enlarged cells compared with controls, and therefore prevents normal cell size regulation under flow conditions in kidney epithelia¹²⁷, establishing a connection between fluid flow, metabolic control and epithelial tubular size.

In conclusion, LKB1 is an activator of the AMPK–mTOR pathway, which links cell metabolism to growth control. Recent evidence has shown a connection between the LKB1–AMPK–mTOR pathway with cell polarity and epithelial architecture. As the access of tumour cells to the key molecules that are used for energy production can be limiting, this connection might be a primitive tumour suppressor mechanism that has arisen to protect cells from the energetic stress that has increased during evolution to form the modern organism.

## Stem cells, spindle orientation and cancer

The maintenance of most adult epithelial tissues relies on the presence of multipotent or unipotent stem cells¹²⁸. These cells are polarized and self-renew through symmetric cell divisions; whereas stem cells asymmetrically divide by reorienting mitotic spindles in order to generate differentiated, specialized cells; although this is still under debate for some tissues¹²⁹. Asymmetric cell divisions have been demonstrated to occur in various epithelial tissues, including the epidermis, gut, mammary glands and lung¹³⁰⁻¹³⁶. In the human and mouse intestine, the alignment of mitotic spindles during asymmetric division of stem cells has been observed, but further studies will be needed to provide more insight into the distribution of cell fate determinants during this process¹³⁴ and to reconcile the differences that are observed in other models in which symmetric cell divisions seem to take place¹³⁷,¹³⁸. Evidence indicates that alterations in normal stem cells or early progenitor cells initiate some types of cancer, including colon, prostate, skin, stomach, breast and lung cancer¹³⁹, although for other epithelial cancers this has not been well defined. This has given rise to two different theories about the cell-of-origin that initiates tumours. One theory postulates that transformation occurs to normal adult stem cells or progenitor cells, whereas the second model proposes that differentiated cells acquire self-renewal capacity and stem cell-like properties on transformation¹³⁹,¹⁴⁰ (FIG. 4a).

Interestingly, many of the genes that control epithelial cell polarity also regulate spindle orientation and the symmetry of stem cell divisions¹²⁹. Epithelial cell polarity

stem cells or progenitor cells to divide symmetrically and to evade differentiation, which might endow them with tumorigenic characteristics<sup>129,141</sup> (FIG. 4a).

**Relationship between the machinery that controls cell polarity and spindle orientation.** To understand how the orientation of the mitotic spindle contributes to differentiation, it is important to understand the molecular mechanisms that regulate its orientation and their links to the cell cycle. The mechanisms that govern this process have mostly been identified in neuroblasts (the sensory organ progenitor cells (SOPs)) in *D. melanogaster* and in neuroepithelial cells from *C. elegans*<sup>129</sup>. In order to reorient the mitotic spindle, cells first respond to extracellular signalling cues, during which Notch signalling has a major role. Additionally, there is an asymmetric distribution of apical and basal determinants during mitosis. In neuroblasts, the apical determinants include the PAR polarity complex, inscuteable (INS), partner of inscuteable (PINS; also known as RAPS). The mammalian functional homologue of PINS is LGN (also known as GPSM2)), aurora (AUR; the mammalian functional homologue is aurora kinase A (AURKA)), guanine nucleotide binding protein-α (Gα), mushroom body defect (MUD; the mammalian functional homologue is nuclear mitotic apparatus protein 1 (NUMA1)), the dynein binding protein lissencephaly 1 (LIS1) and p150<sup>glued</sup> (the mammalian homologue of which is dynactin 1 (DCTN1)). The basal determinants include LGL, NUMB, prospero (PROS; the mammalian homologue is prospero-like protein 1 (PROX1)), and the translation inhibitor brain tumour (BRAT), as well as partner of NUMB (PON) and miranda (MIRA; a coiled-coil protein that interacts with both PROS and BRAT) for which mammalian homologues have not yet been described (FIG. 5). During cell division, centrosomes duplicate early in the G1/S phase of the cell cycle and mature during G2, so that at the end of G2 cells contain two centrosomes (which are comprised of four centrioles). Centrosome separation starts early in mitosis, whereby the daughter centriole migrates from the apical to the basal domain to form the bipolar mitotic spindle<sup>142</sup>. Interestingly, the crosstalk between centrosomal and apical proteins regulates their respective localization<sup>143,144</sup>. In neuroblasts, this ensures the inheritance of the daughter centrosome by the mother stem cell<sup>143</sup>. This differs in other cells, such as *D. melanogaster* male germline stem cells<sup>145</sup> and the radial glial progenitor cells in mice<sup>146</sup>, where the mother centrosome is inherited by the mother stem cell.

Centrosome separation is regulated by several kinases, including those of the NEK, aurora and polo families<sup>142</sup>. In *D. melanogaster* neuroblasts, AUR phosphorylates PAR6 in the PAR6–aPKC–LGN complex early in prophase. This activates aPKC, which then phosphorylates LGL and excludes it from the complex and the apical compartment and targets it to the basal compartment. Next, bazooka (BAZ) associates with the PAR6–aPKC complex and promotes the subsequent phosphorylation and exclusion of NUMB and MIRA from an apical to a basal localization<sup>147</sup>.

defects<sup>148</sup>. During metaphase and telophase of an asymmetric  
mitosis BAZ binds to and recruits INSC. This  
adaptor protein, which is only expressed in cells that  
divide asymmetrically, recruits PINS, Ga<sub>i</sub> and MUD,  
which further promotes the exclusion of NUMB,  
PON, MIRA, BRAT and PROS to the basal crescents  
(FIG. 5). It is important to mention that the precise  
function of these proteins is not well understood, but  
NUMB is involved in endocytosis, is an inhibitor of  
NOTCH, prevents the self-renewal of neuroblasts and  
allows differentiation<sup>129</sup>. MUD binds to PINS, and this  
complex connects microtubules that radiate from the  
centrosomes to the cell cortex, known as astral micro-  
tubules, and generates a pulling force to reorient the  
mitotic spindle. Additionally, in *D. melanogaster* neuro-  
blasts, a parallel pathway that involves the interaction of  
PINS with DLG and the plus end microtubule-oriented  
kinesin 73 (KHC73) functions to orient the mitotic  
spindle asymmetrically<sup>149,150</sup>.

In mammals, the dynamic interaction between  
aPKC-PAR6-PAR3 and LGN-DLG-Ga<sub>i</sub> is also a key  
event for the regulation of spindle orientation and cell  
differentiation<sup>20,151</sup>. In 3D cultures of epithelial cells,  
the distribution of polarity cues to the lateral cortex is  
required to orient cell divisions symmetrically in the  

plane of the basement membrane<sup>152</sup>. In this regard,  
CDC42 recruits the PAR6-aPKC complex to the apical cortex and activates aPKC<sup>21,153,154</sup>, which prevents  
LGN from binding Ga<sub>i</sub> and excludes LGN from the  
apical cortex<sup>151,155,156</sup>. During this process, the recruitment and activity of CDC42 in the apical cortex is  
regulated by the CDC42 GEFs TUBA (also known as  
DNMBP)<sup>157</sup> and intersectin 2, which also localize to  
centrosomes<sup>155</sup>.

In the mammalian epidermis, the expression of  
INSC is sufficient to drive asymmetric cell divisions<sup>131</sup>.  
LGN colocalizes apically with Ga<sub>i</sub> and NUMA in  
mitotic basal progenitor cells, where Ga<sub>i</sub> recruits LGN,  
which in turn recruits NUMA<sup>133</sup> (FIG. 4b). Reductions  
in the levels of these proteins do not alter proliferation  
or apoptosis, but perturb epithelial differentiation  
owing to the resulting impairment in Notch signalling<sup>133</sup>, which is a key signalling pathway for epidermal  
differentiation<sup>158</sup>.

The role of tumour suppressors in the control of spindle  
orientation. The formation of tumours and their progression to malignancy involves a progressive cascade of  
events, typically arising as a consequence of mutations  
in genes that control cell growth. Some tumour suppressors associate directly or indirectly with microtubules  
to either stabilize or destabilize them, and accumulating evidence indicates that they are also involved in the  
oriented positioning of the mitotic spindles<sup>159,160</sup>. These  
include E-cadherin and adhesion molecules, the WNT  
signalling protein adenomatous polyposis coli (APC),  
LKB1, p53 and von Hippel-Lindau tumour suppressor  
(VHL)<sup>161–164</sup> (FIG. 5).

It was recently shown in epithelial cells that adherens junctions control the polarized positioning of centrosomes in interphase cells<sup>165</sup>, and that this involves the actin cytoskeleton and CDC42 activity<sup>166</sup>. Interestingly, this is directly mediated by cadherin-mediated homophilic cell ligation<sup>167</sup>. Because the centrosome functions as the microtubule organizing centre in most cells, loss of E-cadherin may also lead to alterations in centrosomes, orientation of the mitotic spindle and chromosome segregation. However, it is not yet clear which molecules are responsible for the connection between microtubules and adherens junctions during mitosis. In this regard it was shown, using recombinant cadherin ligands, that homophilic ligation of E-cadherin orients mitotic spindles during asymmetric cell division, and blocking E-cadherin function with antibodies, expressing an E-cadherin mutant protein or reducing E-cadherin expression disrupts this polarization and the distribution of APC to the cell cortex<sup>167</sup>. Consistent with these findings, it has been shown that the loss of α-catenin and β1 integrin in the epidermis impairs correct spindle orientation<sup>130</sup>. β-catenin binds to dynein<sup>168</sup>, and it was recently shown that β-catenin colocalizes with NUMB in epicardial cells. β-catenin-null epicardial cells exhibit disruption of adherens junctions and the mislocalization of NUMB, which leads to randomized mitotic spindle orientations in the myocardium<sup>169</sup>.

Figure 5 | **Tumour suppressors and spindle orientation.**  
In addition to the machinery that drives spindle orientation during stem cell divisions, some tumour suppressors have also been associated with regulating the oriented positioning of mitotic spindles<sup>159,160</sup>, including E-cadherin and adhesion molecules, the WNT signalling protein adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), liver kinase B1 (LKB1), von Hippel-Lindau tumour suppressor (VHL) and p53. Mutations in the corresponding genes may impair the proper organization of microtubules or centrosome function or positioning, which leads to misoriented cell division, alterations in differentiation and the expansion of stem cell compartments.

Interestingly, β-catenin is also involved in centrosome separation<sup>170</sup>. APC binds to β-catenin and to the microtubule binding protein end-binding protein 1 (EB1; also known as MAPRE1), which also links kinetochores to kinetochore microtubules, which is important for chromosome stability<sup>171</sup>. In fact, loss of E-cadherin (which binds catenins) in SOPs alters PAR3 distribution and oriented cell divisions<sup>172</sup>. Interestingly, loss of E-cadherin in *D. melanogaster* germline cells also promotes alterations in centrosome positioning, which is probably mediated by the resulting failure to localize APC<sup>173</sup>. p120-catenin (also known as catenin-δ1) also binds to microtubules and regulates centrosome divisions in mammalian cells<sup>174,175</sup>. Further research should provide insight into the possible involvement of adherens junctions and microtubules in the regulation of mitotic spindle orientation.

The mechanisms by which APC regulates spindle orientation are providing additional insight into its roles as a tumour suppressor. APC is mutated in >80% of sporadic colorectal tumours<sup>176</sup>. Most APC mutations that have been found in colorectal cancers encode carboxy-terminal truncations that are required for its interaction with axin and β-catenin, and which therefore abrogate its function in promoting β-catenin degradation, which leads to the constitutive activation of the WNT–β-catenin pathway.

However, APC is also involved in the regulation of the cytoskeleton through its interaction with different microtubule-associated proteins. Interactions between mutated APC and the cytoskeleton have been associated with chromosome instability, and could potentially be involved in the deregulation of cell polarity, motility and cell migration, and therefore cancer progression<sup>58</sup>. Its interactions with the microtubule cytoskeleton, depending on cell context, also seem to be required for correct spindle orientation and cell division. Disrupting APC and its interacting partner, EB1, disorient cell divisions and favour asymmetrical cell division in *D. melanogaster* epithelial cells<sup>177</sup>. In mammals, it has been shown that loss of APC in the epidermis and thymus leads to alterations in cell fate and differentiation<sup>178</sup>. Additionally, APC deletions in intestinal stem cells causally contribute to intestinal adenoma formation<sup>179</sup>, and APC loss in the gut causes spindle misorientation during cell division and induces pre-tumorigenic lesions *in vivo*<sup>134,180</sup>.

The loss of p53 expression or function is one of the most common alterations in carcinomas. It is well established that p53 is involved in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, and a novel role by which its loss might promote tumorigenesis has recently been described in mammary stem cells<sup>135</sup>. The loss of p53 in these cells enhances cell proliferation and promotes symmetric cell divisions that lead to tumorigenesis<sup>135</sup>. This highlights the relevance of the loss of asymmetric cell divisions in tumour initiation. Restoration of p53 expression was sufficient to reduce the replicative potential of mammary cancer stem cells that are deficient in p53 and ERBB2, but also reduced the number of symmetric cell divisions, which promoted cell differentiation<sup>135</sup>. The mechanism may involve the regulation

of the Notch signalling pathway by p53 (REFS 135,181). Interestingly, it has been shown that p53 restricts the reprogramming of somatic cells to form induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS). Loss of p53 allowed the acquisition of stem cell-like properties, and when transplanted *in vivo* these cells gave rise to teratomas<sup>182</sup>.

Finally, a new layer of regulation of spindle orientation that involves VHL has recently been reported. Germline mutations of *VHL* are associated with von Hippel–Lindau syndrome, which is characterized by the development of tumours in several organs, mainly owing to the failure of targeting hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1α) for degradation. However, it has now been shown that VHL regulates spindle orientation by mechanisms that are not yet well understood<sup>163</sup>, but which may involve the deregulation of cell–cell junctions or polarity complexes. In this regard, VHL associates with the PAR polarity complex, and its loss impinges on microtubule stability and cilia formation<sup>194</sup>.

Overall, increasing evidence suggests that the loss of cell polarity proteins in early stages of carcinogenesis contributes to transformation owing to the loss of control of asymmetric cell divisions. This, in addition to the loss of key tumour suppressor proteins that have been implicated in these processes (such as APC, p53 and VHL), may be responsible for the abnormal self-renewal and expansion of the tumour cells of origin.

### Concluding remarks and future perspectives

A wealth of knowledge about the mechanisms that regulate the establishment of cell polarity has unravelled their important contributions to preventing the acquisition of tumorigenic characteristics. Given the crucial roles of polarity complexes in the regulation of several pathways that are required for the proper function and proliferation of epithelial tissues, including the establishment of cell adhesion and the regulation of cell growth, apoptosis and metabolism, they can be potential clinical prognostic factors. Future research will shed light on the molecular nature of these interactions to possibly influence their assembly through therapeutic interventions. Loss of the finely tuned functions of the polarity complexes may also contribute to the early stages of tumorigenesis. The role of polarity complexes in regulating the orientation of centrosomes and mitotic spindles, and thus asymmetric cell division, may affect the balance of proliferation and differentiation in epithelial tissues. Furthermore, the crosstalk with tumour suppressors has been shown to contribute to the expansion of the cells of origin of some tumour types, by circumventing growth inhibitory signals, differentiation, senescence or apoptosis and the acquisition of migratory and invasive characteristics. Understanding the genetic and biochemical mechanisms that control self-renewal and asymmetric division and understanding the role of the stem cell niche in regulating the biological properties of both normal and cancer stem cells are key issues for the future, because preventing these abnormalities may limit the proportion of cells that fuel tumour growth in carcinomas.
