**Positive and negative control of Ucp1 gene transcription and the role of β-adrenergic signaling networks**

Adrenergic receptor signaling in adipocytes controls not only the hydrolysis of triglycerides as fuel for other organs but is also a driver of brown adipocyte thermogenesis and energy consumption. As the appearance of these mitochondria-rich, thermogenically active cells in ‘white’ adipocyte depots is correlated with resistance to overnutrition and glucose intolerance, the molecular basis of their genesis and metabolic activity needs to be understood. β-adrenergic receptors regulate the enzymatic machinery for lipolysis and fuel utilization. They also coordinately stimulate the transcription of genes that support the specific functions of white and brown adipocytes. They accomplish this through the activation of a network of signaling pathways that include cAMP-dependent protein kinase and members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family. In brown adipocytes, these kinases control the transcription of nuclear factors such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1s, as well as other molecules discovered to respond to adrenergic signals, to increase mitochondrial biogenesis and uncoupling protein-1 (UCP1) expression. However, it is also important to understand the mechanisms that may actively repress these energy-wasting processes. Toward that end, we provide evidence for an important role for the nuclear receptor LXRα as a cAMP- and oxysterol-dependent transcriptional repressor of the *Ucp1* gene. Adipocytes from LXRα-null mice have increased expression of most ‘markers’ of brown adipocytes, increased mitochondrial mass and uncoupled respiration. These studies reveal potential new targets and directions for controlling the relative levels of white versus brown adipocytes as a means of metabolic fuel utilization in the struggle against obesity and related metabolic diseases.

**Introduction**

The sympathetic nervous system (SNS) controls (i) mobilization of stored energy and (ii) adaptive thermogenesis in adipose tissue through the activation of β-adrenergic receptors (βARs). All three known βAR subtypes are expressed in adipocytes. It is well established that βARs are coupled to the heterotrimeric G-protein Gs and to adenyl cyclase, resulting in elevated levels of intracellular cAMP and activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). PKA has been considered as the ultimate component responsible for activating lipolytic enzymes and for expression in brown adipocytes of the genes encoding uncoupling protein-1 (UCP1) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ

coactivator-1α (PGC-1α). However, besides this classic pathway, additional signaling cascades emanate from βARs in adipocytes, including the ERK and p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathways (Figure 1), which have roles in regulating fuel mobilization and thermogenesis.¹⁻³ The p38 MAP kinase pathway has been of particular interest to us as we unexpectedly observed that its activation in response to PKA regulated the expression of *Ucp1* and *Pgc1α* genes in brown adipocytes (Figure 2). This PKA–p38 pathway also exists in white adipocytes, including human adipocytes, and yet its function in this cell type is still unclear to us; however, new studies on a targeted deletion of p38α MAP kinase in adipose tissue are proving to be informative in defining its role.

The essential role of SNS in the control of adipose tissue metabolism is further exemplified by mice deficient in the synthesis of noradrenaline or in the expression of βARs. In these mutants, there is an absence of brown adipose tissue (BAT) that is replaced by white adipose tissue (WAT).⁴⁻⁵

$\beta$AR signaling networks of brown fat  
S Collins et al  

![Diagram](https://i.imgur.com/1234567.png)  

Figure 1 The three $\beta$ARs in adipocytes all couple to heterotrimeric Gs to increase cyclic AMP (cAMP) production, but they are also able to activate other signaling pathways in adipocytes that affect metabolism. cAMP binds to the protein kinase A (PKA) regulatory subunit, which, in adipocytes, is usually the membrane-associated Type II kinase bound to an A-kinase anchoring protein (AKAP). The catalytic subunit (PKA-Cat) is released to phosphorylate its various targets, such as lipases and the lipid droplet protein perilipin, which is a very abundant and heavily phosphorylated target of PKA. Events downstream of PKA allow the $\beta$ARs to activate the p38 MAP kinase as well. The adipocyte $\beta_3$AR is also able to activate the ERK MAP kinase pathway by a novel process of direct binding of Src and related signaling molecules to conserved intracellular regions; one consequence of this ERK activation is lipolysis that is independent of that activated by PKA. Not shown for simplicity: the $\beta_1$AR and $\beta_2$AR can also be phosphorylated by PKA and G-protein-coupled receptor kinases. These phosphorylation events on $\beta_1$AR and $\beta_2$AR desensitize their ability to activate adenyl cyclase, but on the other hand initiate binding of other proteins to activate the ERK MAP kinase pathway. Note that the $\beta_3$AR does not seem to be phosphorylated.

Figure 2 $\beta$AR activation of p38 MAP kinase in brown adipocytes activates the transcription of $Ucp1$ and $Pgc-1\alpha$ genes for adaptive thermogenesis, mitochondrial biogenesis and fatty acid oxidation. Direct targets of p38 MAP kinase include the PGC-$1\alpha$ coactivator and the transcription factor ATF-2. The biochemical steps (dashed arrow) between PKA and the p38 MAP kinase model are not yet defined, but current results indicate that the p38$\alpha$ isoform and MAP kinase kinase-3 (MKK3)) are required, together with a JIP scaffold. The identity of the remaining components is a work in progress.

A similar loss of functioning BAT is observed in animals that have been maintained at thermoneutrality. ${}^{6-8}$ Altogether, these results suggest that mechanisms exist whereby $\beta$-agonists have the potential to promote postnatal changes in the WAT/BAT ratio, which could possibly induce weight loss in humans as is observed in laboratory animals such as adult dogs and rhesus monkeys. ${}^{9-14}$ These latter two species are similar to humans in that, unlike rodents, they do not retain large discrete depots of BAT in adulthood, yet they can still exhibit mixed white and brown adipocyte populations.

Owing to this remarkable plasticity of adipose tissue, it has been largely assumed that white and brown adipocytes derive from a common progenitor cell during development. However, the most recent evidence to emerge is that precursor cells of brown adipocytes possess a gene expression/transcription factor profile more closely resembling

UCP1 and production of thermogenically active brown adipocytes within typical WAT depots?

We chose to focus on the role of LXR—specifically LXRα—in the regulation of Ucp1 gene transcription and brown adipocyte thermogenesis, because we had noticed a potential LXR binding site (direct repeat spaced by 4 (DR-4)) in an important 'enhancer' region of the Ucp1 gene (Figure 3), and mice lacking LXRs²⁴ have a lean phenotype and dramatic increase in UCP1 expression in white fat. Together, this suggested to us that LXR might function as a direct repressor of Ucp1 gene transcription through this DR-4 binding site. Conceptually, this was an attractive hypothesis, as the role of LXRs to promote lipogenesis and energy storage is diametrically opposed to an energy-wasting process such as brown fat thermogenesis. As the phenotype of adipose tissues and isolated cells from the LXRα–/– mouse was essentially identical to that of the LXRα–/–:LXRβ–/– 'double knockout' with regard to Ucp1 gene expression,²⁸ the evidence pointed to a specific role for LXRα in this process.

Such a role for LXRα was revealed by the following studies. As we previously reported, using cultured brown adipocytes, we could show that under conditions that mimicked SNS activation, such as treatment with the βAR agonist isoprenaline (Iso) or the adenyl cyclase activator forskolin (Fsk), the ability to increase Ucp1 gene transcription was significantly blunted in the presence of an LXR ligand.²⁸ At the same time, LXR ligands still stimulate the expression of known target genes such as sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 (Srebp-1), and also have no effect on cAMP-dependent Pgc1α gene expression. LXRα was found to bind to the Ucp1 DR-4 element in gel shift and chromatin

Some regions that are important for transcriptional regulation include the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)/RXR binding DR-1 element; CRE2, which we have reported is bound by phospho-ATF-2; an LXRα binding DR-4 element; two regions referred to as brown fat response elements (BRE1, BRE2).

immunoprecipitation experiments, and mutations within the DR-4 eliminated both binding and the ability to function as a repressor.²⁸ An interesting facet of these studies was the observation that when mouse embryo fibroblasts from wild-type or LXRα-null mice were differentiated into adipocytes in culture, there was a remarkable acquisition of most features of a 'brown' adipocyte by LXRα−/− cells, as shown in Figure 4. This included the expression levels of a battery of genes that are typically expressed in brown adipocytes (Figure 4a), as well as a greater density of mitochondria and increased oxygen consumption; a significant fraction of which were uncoupled (Figure 4b).

The mechanism underlying this transcriptional repression is still not completely clear but seems to involve two important parameters: (i) the availability of an LXR ligand and (ii) the competition for occupancy of the closely spaced DR-4 and DR-1 elements of the Ucp1 enhancer, as illustrated

**Figure 5** Cartoon model for LXR$\alpha$ regulation of $Ucp1$ gene transcription. (a) Activation of PKA by $\beta$ARs leads to p38 MAP kinase activity and phosphorylation of nuclear factors such as ATF2 and PGC-1$\alpha$ to increase transcription of the $Ucp1$ gene. Also in response to PKA there is phosphorylation of LXR$\alpha$ by an (as yet) unidentified kinase. LXR$\alpha$ also occupies an adjacent DR-4 site, but the mechanistic basis of this is unclear. (b) When an LXR ligand is present (yellow diamond in step 1), the nuclear corepressor RIP140 is recruited to the complex (step 2), and the critical regulator peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) is eliminated from its DR-1 binding site (step 3), the net result of which is repression of $Ucp1$ gene transcription.

low, with sufficient levels of (i) oxygen for reduction to H$_2$O, (ii) adenosine diphosphate for conversion to adenosine triphosphate and functioning transport processes within the mitochondria, and as long as molecules such as UCP2 are in sufficient supply, a high rate of respiration is not necessarily detrimental.

### Summary

The crucial role of SNS to regulate adipocyte metabolism, expand the mass and thermogenic capacity of BAT and promote the 'appearance' of thermogenically competent brown adipocytes within WAT depots has been known for many years to be the provenance of $\beta$AR receptors and their second messenger, cAMP. The elements in the biochemical pathways that orchestrate these events have proven to be a more intricate web than previously thought, with elements still to be identified to complete the path. The search to identify molecules and pathways that increase brown adipocyte density and activity in mammals has been going on for decades. Uncovering those pathways that actively oppose or repress the expression of UCP, and possibly a broader program of transcription of genes involved in

mitochondriogenesis, fat oxidation and uncoupling, has the potential to reveal molecular switches that may permit expansion of brown adipocytes to prevent or reverse obesity and metabolic disease by increasing energy expenditure and oxidative respiration. Exciting times are ahead for discoveries in these signaling and regulatory cascades.
