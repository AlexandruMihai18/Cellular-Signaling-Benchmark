# Apelin/APJ Signaling Is a Critical Regulator of Statin Effects in Vascular Endothelial Cells—Brief Report

**Danielle L. McLean,† Jongmin Kim,† Yujung Kang, Hong Shi, G. Brandon Atkins, Mukesh K. Jain, Hyung J. Chun**

**Objective**—The endothelial response elicited by the G-protein–coupled receptor pathway involving apelin and APJ predicts an overall vasoprotective effect. As a number of downstream endothelial targets of apelin/APJ signaling are also known to be targeted by statins (3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl [HMG]-CoA reductase inhibitors) as potential mediators of their known pleiotropic effects, we evaluated for the involvement of apelin/APJ signaling in statin endothelial effects.

**Methods and Results**—We found that disruption of apelin/APJ signaling in endothelial cells leads to significantly decreased expression of Krüppel-like factor 2, endothelial nitric oxide synthase, and thrombomodulin. We found that statin-mediated induction of Krüppel-like factor 2, endothelial nitric oxide synthase, and thrombomodulin expression, as well as inhibition of monocyte-endothelial adhesion, was abrogated by concurrent apelin knockdown. Moreover, we found that statins can transcriptionally regulate APJ in a Krüppel-like factor 2–dependent manner, demonstrating the presence of a positive-feedback loop.

**Conclusion**—Our findings provide a novel mechanism by which the apelin/APJ pathway serves as a critical intermediary that links statin to its pleiotropic effects in regulating endothelial gene targets and function. (*Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol.* 2012;32:2640-2643.)

### Mice

KLF2 flox/flox mice were previously described.¹⁰ These mice were crossed to CAG-CreERT2 mice (Jackson Labs), and Cre-mediated excision was induced in 4-week-old mice by injection with tamoxifen (1 mg/injection × 10 daily injections) intraperitoneally. All mouse experimentation was done in congruence with the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Yale University and Case Western Reserve University.

### Results

#### Apelin Regulates KLF2 and Downstream Targets in Multiple Endothelial Cells

KLF2 is known to be a critical regulator of endothelial homeostasis.¹¹⁻¹³ We previously found that KLF2 is downregulated in the lungs of apelin-deficient mice and human pulmonary artery ECs subjected to apelin/APJ knockdown.² To determine whether apelin regulation of KLF2 occurs in the ECs from other vascular beds, we evaluated the effect of apelin knockdown in human umbilical vein ECs (HUVECs) and human coronary artery

ECs. We found that in these ECs there was a marked reduction of KLF2 mRNA and protein expression with apelin knockdown (Figure 1A and 1B). We also evaluated the effect of augmented apelin signaling on the KLF2 promoter activity using a luciferase reporter driven by a minimal 221-bp KLF2 promoter.⁵ We found that apelin overexpression in HUVECs was able to robustly increase the promoter activity (Figure 1C). We next determined whether apelin-mediated KLF2 expression results in the regulation of the downstream targets of KLF2. We found that both eNOS and THBD, known targets of KLF2,¹⁴ are significantly downregulated with apelin knockdown (Figure 1D and 1G).

### Intact Apelin/APJ Signaling Is Critical for Statin-Mediated Endothelial Gene Regulation and Function

Previous studies demonstrated that statins can induce a number of genes thought to be critical for endothelial homeostasis, including KLF2, eNOS, and THBD. To determine whether apelin/APJ signaling plays a role in the statin-mediated expression of these target genes, we evaluated the effects of apelin knockdown on statin stimulation in HUVECs. We found a robust induction of KLF2, eNOS, and THBD by stimulation with statin, which was markedly reduced when these cells were concurrently subjected to apelin knockdown (Figure 1E–1G).

We further evaluated whether abrogation of apelin/APJ signaling can impair the physiological effects of statin on ECs. Previous studies demonstrated that statins can reduce monocyte adhesion to ECs, at least in part via induction of THBD and eNOS.¹⁵⁻¹⁸ To determine whether apelin/APJ signaling plays a role in this process, we determined monocyte adhesion to ECs in response to statin in conjunction with apelin knockdown. Fluorescent-labeled THP-1 monocytes were incubated with HUVECs pretreated with rosuvastatin or simvastatin and apelin small interfering RNA. We found a significant reduction of monocyte adhesion to HUVECs that were pretreated with statin as expected (Figure 1H). When statin was administered to cells subjected to apelin knockdown, we found a marked inhibition in the statin-mediated reduction of monocyte adhesion to HUVECs (Figure 1H).

Statins Induce a Known Downstream G-Protein Target of APJ

To further characterize the statin–apelin/APJ link, we determined whether statins have the capacity to augment APJ activation. Apelin–APJ signaling is known to induce activation of the G-protein subunit Gαi, leading to the inhibition of forskolin-induced cAMP production.¹⁹,²⁰ We found that apelin stimulation robustly inhibited the forskolin-induced cAMP production in APJ-overexpressing COS cells (Figure 1I). Remarkably, we also found a comparable inhibition of cAMP production when APJ-transfected COS cells were stimulated with statin agents (Figure 1I). This statin effect was dependent on APJ, as control cells not expressing APJ failed to respond to statin or apelin (Figure 1I).

Statins Induce Positive Feedback of Apelin/APJ Signaling via Upregulation of APJ Expression

We next evaluated whether statin can affect the expression of the components of apelin/APJ signaling. We found no significant change in apelin expression in HUVECs with statin treatment, suggesting that the increased apelin levels observed in recent clinical trials⁸,⁹ likely require prolonged statin exposure, or may originate from another cell type (Figure I in the online-only Data Supplement). Interestingly, we found that all statin agents tested robustly induced APJ expression in HUVECs (Figure 2A and 2B). A previous study demonstrated that KLF2 may be involved in transcriptional regulation of APJ in Xenopus.²¹ Indeed, we found putative KLF2 binding sites in the human APJ promoter (data not shown), and found that APJ upregulation temporally followed the simvastatin-mediated induction of KLF2 expression (Figure 2C). To determine whether KLF2 may be involved in the statin-mediated induction of APJ, we evaluated the effects of small interfering RNA-mediated KLF2 knockdown on APJ expression. We found a significant reduction of APJ expression in HUVECs treated with KLF2 small interfering RNA, as well as abrogation of statin-mediated induction of APJ in the context of KLF2 knockdown (Figure 2D and 2E). We also assessed APJ mRNA and protein expression using lung tissue from floxed control (KLF2:fl/fl+tamoxifen) and KLF2 knockout

(KLF2:fl/fl:CAGCreERT2+tamoxifen) mice, given the embryonic lethality of KLF2-null mice. In accordance with the cell culture data, APJ levels were significantly reduced in the KLF2 knockout mice (Figure 2F and 2G). Moreover, we generated luciferase reporter constructs that contain the upstream putative promoter regions of the human APJ gene. Three different lengths of APJ promoter (-201bp, -450bp, or -1392bp) reporter constructs were generated, with only the longest reporter constructs containing the putative KLF2 binding sites. There was no effect of KLF2 overexpression on the promoter activity of the 2 shorter (-201bp and -450bp) constructs that lack KLF2 binding sites. However, cells transfected with the -1392bp construct displayed significantly increased promoter activity when treated with the KLF2 virus (Figure 2H).

### Discussion

Our findings are the first to demonstrate that an intact apelin/APJ signaling pathway is critical for the previously described pleiotropic effects of statins on ECs. Pleiotropic effects of statins have been well documented and are associated with the improvement of cardiovascular outcomes above and beyond the lipid-lowering effects. Here, we demonstrate that abrogation of apelin/APJ signaling leads to a significant inhibition of statin-mediated induction of KLF2, eNOS, and THBD. Moreover, we found that statin stimulation leads to activation of Gαi in an APJ-dependent manner, as well as transcriptional induction of APJ, the only known receptor for apelin. Further studies are warranted to determine whether statins directly activate APJ or potentiate apelin-mediated activation of APJ. These findings suggest the presence of a positive-feedback loop, where statin-mediated target gene induction is dependent on apelin/APJ signaling in the endothelium, and the resulting increase in KLF2 expression leads to further augmentation of apelin/APJ signaling via upregulation of APJ (Figure 2I). Our findings provide a novel mechanism of the effects of statin on the endothelium and significantly extend our understanding of the importance of apelin/APJ signaling in atherosclerosis and vascular homeostasis.
