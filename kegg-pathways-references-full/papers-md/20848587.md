### Abstract.

Life expectancy at the turn of the 20th century was 46 years on average worldwide and it is around 65 years today. The correlative increase in age-associated diseases incidence has a profound public health impact and is an important matter of concern for our societies. Aging is a complex, heterogeneous, and multifactorial phenomenon, which is the consequence of multiple interactions between genes and environment. In this review, we survey animals models that have been of great help for both investigating mechanism of aging and identifying molecules, which slow down the onset of age-related diseases. Resveratrol (RSV) is one of those. We will report evidences supporting RSV as a molecule that acts by mimicking the beneficial effects of dietary restriction, and may share common downstream targets with rapamycin and metformin. Although those molecules do not reveal all the secrets of the fountain of youth, they may help us maintaining the quality of life in the old age.

### 1. Aging is modulated by molecular pathways which are conserved throughout evolution

Aging-related research was primarily focused on understanding the molecular processes that cause aging. This has been first addressed by looking for genetic manipulations that extend life span of simple model organism. Initial evidence for gene impact on life span came from the work done in late 80s with the nematode *Caenorhabditis elegans*, in which mutations that reduce the activity of the PI3 kinase ortholog AGE-1 [1] or of the insulin/IGF-1 receptor (IIR) can double average life span [2]. Later on, the role of the IIR pathway in life span regulation was shown to be conserved in higher organisms such as mice [3,4].

Another important, nongenetic, intervention that increases life span throughout the animal kingdom is the reduction of caloric intake, also called dietary restriction (DR), to 30–50% below *ad libitum* levels without malnutrition.

DR has been shown to increase life span in a variety of different organisms in the laboratory, including yeast, nematode, flies, and rodents [5–7] and also more recently in primates [8]. Furthermore, DR also delays the onset of age-related diseases, improves stress resistance, decelerates functional decline [8,9], and its beneficial effects has also been observed to some extent in human [10].

### 2. Resveratrol treatment extends the life span of simple model organisms by mimicking dietary restriction

A number of observations suggested that DR beneficial effects result from highly regulated processes, rather than passive metabolic changes, which depend on the activation of specific effectors. Indeed, the Guarente laboratory reported in 2000 that the life span increase induced by calorie restriction in the budding yeast *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* was no longer effective in *SIR2* mutants [11]. *SIR2* belongs to the sirtuin family of NAD+-dependent deacetylases that are homologous to SIRT1 in mammals. Extra copies of *SIR2* or its homologs extend life span not only in yeast [12] but also in worms [13] and flies [14]. Furthermore, SIRT1 is required for the induction of physiological changes associated to DR in mice [15,16] and its overexpression mimics DR beneficial effects [17].

Those observations supported the idea that if a drug can alter the activity of sirtuins, then DR health benefits may be recapitulated pharmacologically without lowering food intake. In line with this concept, resveratrol (RSV) was initially identified in 2003 from an *in vitro* screen aimed at isolating molecules that activate the sirtuin SIRT1 [18]. In agreement with the notion that RSV activates SIR2 and its orthologs, RSV treatment extends the life span between 18 and 56% of *S. cerevisiae* [18], *C. elegans* [19], and *Drosophila melanogaster* [20] and its effect depends on SIR2. However, it has to be noticed that modulation of life span by RSV may require specific experimental conditions. Indeed, RSV impact on life span was not observed when tested on yeast, worms, and flies in some laboratories [21,22].

### 3. Resveratrol diet induces physiological changes associated to dietary restriction in mice

Studies in rodents have confirmed beneficial effects of RSV treatment on several physiological parameters in obese mice. It reversed a number of deleterious effects induced by high calorie diet including impaired glucose homeostasis, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, endurance exercise, and cardiovascular dysfunction [23–25]. Those effects probably account for the increased survival of mice to the point where it was not significantly different from the one of nonobese standard diet mice.

In 2008, two independent studies also reported the beneficial effects of RSV on health and life span in the context of standard diet compared to mice under DR [26,27]. Authors investigated gene expression changes during aging in several tissues and physiological signs of aging. They reported that both DR and RSV have overlapping effects on alterations in gene expression in multiple tissues including liver, heart, skeletal muscles, adipose tissue, and neocortex. Thus, RSV can clearly mimic a large component of the transcriptional profile of DR even if those studies were driven in different conditions regarding several experimental aspects including RSV treatment (duration of treatment and dose), mice strains, and DR protocol (performed by lowering calorie intake [26] or by every-other day feeding also called EOD [27]). Furthermore, similarly to DR, RSV slowed the age-related decline of several organs and functions. Interestingly, both studies indicated that the effects of RSV were not dependent on weight loss, since conversely to dietary restricted mice, RSV-treated mice did not lose weight. Those data thus show that RSV beneficial effects go beyond the context of obesity.

Additionally, RSV protects against a variety of age-related diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases, different forms of cancer, and cardiovascular disease [28] as detailed in other chapters of this review. However, in the context of standard diet, RSV did not increase overall survival or maximum life span [27]. It may also be that RSV does not impact the specific causes of death in those mice strains and this would deserve to be assessed in other genetic background. Nevertheless, although EOD feeding protocol increased life span of mice, this increase was statistically significant compared with standard diet fed mice only when RSV was added to the diet. Thus, increasing the dose and/or the duration of RSV treatment may end up also increasing average and maximum life span.

### 4. Resveratrol molecular targets and effectors that mediate its effect on health and life span: From sirtuins to AMPK and PGC-1alpha

Until recently, sirtuins appeared as the best candidate for being both a direct target and an important effector of RSV beneficial health effects. Regarding obesity, other sirtuins activators have also shown similar protection in mice, suggesting that this effect of resveratrol is likely mediated by sirtuins [29]. However, the extent to which the sirtuin-activating actions of RSV are direct has been questioned during the last years. Indeed, biochemical approaches indicated that RSV may not activate sirtuins toward biological relevant substrates [21,22,30,31] and that target activation requires the presence of a covalently bound fluorophore [31]. Thus, although a number of evidences indicate that sirtuins mediate at least some of RSV effects, they may not be RSV direct target(s).

Other potential RSV substrates have been identified *in vitro* and/or *in vivo* which includes AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which has also been shown to activate SIRT1 [32]. AMPK plays a central role in cellular energy homeostasis and is activated by conditions that deplete ATP and increase AMP:ATP ratio, such as hypoxia, hypoglycaemia, and ischaemia. Furthermore, AMPK is also a direct substrate for the oncosuppressive serine threonine kinase LKB1. AMPK activation leads to the phosphorylation of a large number of downstream targets leading to an overall inactivation of energy-using/anabolic pathways while energy-generating/catabolic pathways are switched on, thus, helping to restore the energy balance within the cell.

AMPK has very recently emerged as another potentially important aging-related target of RSV. RSV activates AMPK *in vivo* [33,34] and overexpression of AMPK has been shown to increase life span in nematode [35]. The essential role of AMPK for RSV *in vivo* response has been recently demonstrated by Um et al. [36] who used mice deficient in the catalytic subunit of AMPK (alpha1 or alpha2). These mice did not benefit from RSV treatment under high calorie regimen. Furthermore, in embryonic fibroblast isolated from those mice, RSV failed to increase peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1 alpha (PGC-1alpha) target genes. AMPK phosphorylates and activates PGC-1alpha, resulting in the upregulation of mitochondrial biogenesis [37], which is a conserved feature in caloric restriction. Activation of PGC-1alpha also improves mitochondria function by inducing genes expression for mitochondrial and fatty acid oxidation and by increasing mitochondrial membrane
potential [38]. Interestingly, SIRT1 may also control PGC-1alpha activation via its deacetylation [24]. Future studies should examine whether the same is true for other mutual substrate of AMPK and SIRT1, such as Forkhead box class O.

The functional interplay between AMPK and SIRT1 is complex and depends on the cellular context. Indeed, data obtained in condition of chronic treatment by RSV of hepatocytes suggest that SIRT1 can also lay upstream LKB1/AMPK to control lipid metabolism [39]. This finding is supported by the capacity of SIRT1 to activate LKB1 via its direct deacetylation [40]. Furthermore, AMPK activation by RSV in neurons is LKB1 dependent but SIRT1 independent [41]. Additionally, AMPK activation may also be secondary to the direct inhibitory RSV interaction with the mitochondrial F1 ATPase [42], which would result in ATP depletion. Overall, although the mechanisms responsible for AMPK activation by RSV are not completely clear, overall data suggest an important function of AMPK as an effector of RSV-induced beneficial effects.

RSV has been shown to have a number of potential targets, which can be either activated or inhibited [43]. Their respective role in the regulation of both health and life span would deserve to be tested. Among other, PI3K, which is inhibited by RSV, would be a good candidate given its powerful life span lengthening effect in worms and its important role in human tumors.

### 5. Other potential dietary restriction mimetics: Metformin and rapamycin

Two other molecules, rapamycin and metformin, have been shown to improve age-associated diseases and may act through similar mechanisms of action as RSV.

#### 5.1. Metformin

Metformin is a drug in the biguanides class, widely used as first-line therapy for type 2 diabetes. Physiological consequences associated to metformin treatment are similar to those observed in animals under DR. Metformin treatment lowers blood glucose predominantly by decreasing its production by the liver. It also increases peripheral tissue insulin-dependent glucose uptake and promotes fatty acid usage leading to lowering of animals fat mass [44]. Comparative transcriptomic analysis from the liver of mice treated by metformin or under DR revealed consistent homologies between profiles, which support the similarity of physiological features shared by both treatments. Furthermore, epidemiological analyses indicate that it may reduce cancer incidence in diabetic type 2 patients [45]. Those observations suggest that metformin may have a broader positive effect on health, although in the case of obese patients one cannot exclude that the decrease in cancer occurrence results primarily from its effect on weight loss, and thus may be restricted to overweight patients. However, the beneficial effect of metformin on healthy life span have been reported in different models, including cancer prone mice which showed an extended life span and a delay in the appearance of tumors [46].

The role of metformin in the life span regulation of healthy animals has been recently reported in two studies. Smith et al. [47] have shown that when rats were fed in parallel either a DR regimen or metformin treatment, although DR extended early life span (25th quantile), metformin treatment did not significantly affect life span. Conversely, the Driscoll laboratory has shown that metformin increases *C. elegans* average life span by 40% [48]. When metformin treatment was applied to *eat-2* mutants, a genetic model of DR in *C. elegans*, in which *eat-2* mutation lowers food intake by slowing down pharyngeal pumping, then the life span extension was no longer observed. They next took genetic approaches toward identifying metformin molecular effectors. The life span promoting action of metformin was suppressed in mutants for AMPK, called *aak-2*, and its upstream activating kinase LKB1, called *par-4* in *C. elegans*. Further analysis revealed that the extension of life span by metformin treatment also relies on the activity of the NRF2/SKN-1 transcription factor which is well known for its role in the response to oxidative stress in both mammals and *C. elegans*.

Although our understanding of metformin's effects at the tissue and organ level has progressed, its direct molecular target remains unknown. It was initially proposed that metformin inhibits the mitochondrial electron transporting enzyme complex I of the respiratory chain in isolated hepatocytes [49,50] and it has also been shown to activate the enzyme AMPK in the same cells [51]. As AMPK can be activated by an increased AMP/ATP ratio and given that inhibition of the respiratory chain eventually leads to a decrease in ATP production, both mechanisms may be tightly linked in response to metformin. Interestingly, AMPK is also activated by its upstream kinases LKB1 [52], and thus life span data in *C. elegans* [48] support a model in which AMPK/AAK-2 and LBK1/PAR-4 would mediate metformin effect on general health. Overall, experimental evidences associate a key role to AMPK in the response to metformin but whether this kinase is activated by metformin directly or indirectly, via the alteration of cell’s energy status and AMP/ATP ratio and/or through its upstream kinase remains to be elucidated. Given that AMPK has been shown to activate the sirtuin enzyme SIRT1, thus metformin may also behave as a SIRT1 activator via its effect on AMPK [32].

However, a recent report challenged this view by demonstrating that metformin could also inhibit the serine/threonine kinase target of rapamycin (TOR; see below) in a rag GTPase-dependent and AMPK-independent manner [53]. Thus, metformin targets may be wider than expected but those targets may not function at the same time and in the same tissue. Metformin treatment of mice that do not express AMPK and/or TOR and/or SIRT1 in certain tissues important for overall metabolic homeostasis may help to better understand the functional relationship between its different direct/indirect targets and its physiological effects.

#### 5.2. Rapamycin

Conversely to RSV and metformin, rapamycin substrate has been clearly identified and its impact on life span of healthy

Life span extension by resveratrol, rapamycin, and metformin
animals has been demonstrated. Rapamycin was initially identified as a new antibiotic with strong antifungal activity, secreted by bacteria isolated from Easter Island (Rapa Nui). A genetic screen aimed at determining rapamycin molecular target for its antiproliferative activity in yeast led to the identification of the serine threonine kinase TOR. Rapamycin derivatives are now used in clinical practice as an immunosuppressors to prevent graft rejection but also for cancer treatment.

The role of rapamycin and/or TOR inactivation in life span extension has been clearly demonstrated in both simple model organisms and more recently in mammals. TOR inhibition is sufficient to increase life span in yeast, nematode, and flies [54]. Furthermore, rapamycin was shown to increase life span in mice and strikingly, this effect was reported for mice treated at an advanced age corresponding roughly to 60 years in people [55].

Epistasis studies in yeast [56] and C. elegans [57] indicate that TOR is required for life span extension by DR. TOR is a nutrient-sensing protein which plays a key role in starvation response. Decreased nutrient availability will inhibit TOR (in part through the AMPK) and this will result in translational inhibition and autophagy activation via, among other effectors, phosphorylation of S6K. Interestingly, Selman et al. [58] recently reported that deletion of ribosomal S6 protein kinase 1 (S6K1), led to increased life span and resistance to age-related pathologies (such as bone, immune, and motor dysfunction and loss of insulin sensitivity). S6K homologs also modulate aging in yeast, nematodes, and flies, thus making of the TOR/S6K axis a conserved longevity modifying pathway. Furthermore, comparison of gene expression profiles in muscle of S6K knockout mice revealed overlapping upregulated targets both with DR mice and with mice treated with the AMPK activator aminoimidazole carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR). Thus, the extension of life span in those mice may also rely on AMPK activation.

Overall, studies aimed at directly testing the impact of rapamycin on life span are limited while a number of experimental evidences have been accumulated on the role of TOR in life span regulation. TOR can be associated with two different complexes, TORC1 and TORC2, which show both overlapping and independent biological activities. Given that rapamycin appears to be specific for TORC1, whether treating animals with rapamycin will completely recapitulate the benefits of TOR inhibition at the level of the whole organism remains to be assessed in details. Furthermore, experiments performed in fly show that rapamycin can further extend the life span of DR animals [59], thus indicating that additional mechanisms to those induced by DR may mediate TOR role in life span.

**Fig. 1. Potential molecular effectors of resveratrol, metformin, and rapamycin for life span regulation. This scheme constitutes an oversimplified model as multiple effectors have been described for the three nutrient/ energy sensors proteins TOR, AMPK, and SIRT1. Only the main effectors that have been tightly linked to longevity are shown. Indeed, a number of evidences in literature pinpoint the importance of autophagy, translation, and mitochondria function in DR response for life span extension.**

**6. Toward the definition of a multistep drugable prolongevity/ health beneficial molecular pathway**

Potential molecular targets for RSV and metformin, and the well-known rapamycin target TOR define an interconnected network (Fig. 1) in which PGC-1alpha may be an important readout of the complex interplay between AMPK, TOR, and

SIRT1. Furthermore, there is increasing evidence that the antiaging action of DR, at least in part, stems from the attenuation of the age-associated increase in oxidative damages. Transcription factors and coactivators involved in the regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis and energy metabolism with PGC-1alpha are thus strong candidates for playing a central role in life span extension by DR.

Whether the beneficial effects on life span and the delay of age-related pathologies can be transposed to human remains to be demonstrated. Furthermore, paradoxically, low body weight in middle-aged and elderly humans is associated with increased mortality [60]. Thus, rather than DR regimen, pharmaceutical interventions that recapitulate DR beneficial effect without body weight lost would be of great value. Regarding this matter, RSV holds good promise.
