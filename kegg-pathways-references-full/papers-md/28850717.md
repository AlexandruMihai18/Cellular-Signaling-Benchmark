**Summary**

Cushing’s disease (CD) is a rare disabling condition caused by Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-secreting adenomas of the pituitary. The majority of corticotropin adenomas are monoclonal and occur sporadically. Only rarely does CD arise in the context of genetic familial syndromes. Targeted sequencing of oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes commonly mutated in other tumours did not identify recurrent mutations. In contrast, next generation sequencing allowed us recently to clarify the genetic basis of CD: we identified somatic driver mutations in the ubiquitin-specific protease 8 (USP8) gene in a significant portion of corticotropinomas. These mutations represent a novel and unique mechanism leading to ACTH excess. Inhibition of USP8 or its downstream signalling pathways could represent a new therapeutic approach for the management of CD. In this review, we will focus on this new evidence and its implication for clinical care of affected patients.

**1 | INTRODUCTION**

Cushing’s disease (CD) is a rare devastating condition leading to chronic hypercortisolism. It is caused by Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-secreting tumours (corticotropinomas) of the pituitary gland. With an incidence of 1.2-1.7 cases per million per year, its epidemiology is consistent with a classical rare disease. ${}^{1}$ CD is associated with increased morbidity and mortality, the latter mainly due to cardiovascular events. ${}^{2}$ Pituitary adenomas are mainly monoclonal neoplasms. ${}^{3}$ The genetic basis of CD was unclear until recently when recurrent activating somatic driver mutations in the ubiquitin-specific protease 8 gene (USP8) were identified in almost half of corticotropinomas. ${}^{4-8}$ Based on this evidence, the pathophysiology of CD has become much clearer. In addition, identification of driver mutations opens up novel diagnostic and therapeutic options for CD. Abbreviations which are used throughout the text are defined in the appendix at the end of the article.

**1.1 | Mechanisms of tumorigenesis**

Corticotropinomas are characterized by altered expression of proteins regulating cell cycle progression. Overexpression of several cyclins has been frequently documented in pituitary adenomas, with over-expression of cyclin E (CCNE1) being specific for corticotropinomas. ${}^{9}$ In contrast, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors such as p16/Ink4a and p27/Kip1 are downregulated in these tumours. ${}^{10-12}$ In particular, p27/Kip1 protein is dramatically reduced in the majority of corticotropinomas. ${}^{13}$ None of the factors that regulate p27 translation and could explain its downregulation at protein but not transcript level, such as dyskeratosis congenita (DKC1)/Dyskerin, ribosomal protein S13 (RPS13), miR221 and miR222, are deregulated in corticotropinomas. ${}^{14}$

A recent study using quantitative real time PCR showed decreased transcripts for cyclin D1 and CCNE1 and increased for p16/Ink4 in the 10 CD tumours compared to 11 silent corticotropinomas and 22 nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas. ${}^{15}$

Of particular interest for corticotroph tumorigenesis is the CDK5 and ABL1 enzyme substrate 1 (CABLES1), a tumour suppressor that negatively regulates cell cycle by inactivation of several CDKs. CABLES1 immunoreactivity is lost or severely downregulated in more than half of CD tumours, and this correlates with the loss of p27/kip1 protein. ${}^{16}$ As CABLES1 stabilizes the cell cycle inhibitors p21/Cip1 and p27/Kip1, its loss may contribute to development of corticotropinomas, by downregulation of p27/kip1 and destabilization of

p21/cip1.¹⁶ Screening a cohort of 146 paediatric and 35 adult patients with CD for CABLES1 gene mutations and copy number variations (CNV) revealed 4 potentially pathogenic missense germline variants in 4 female patients: 2 in young adults and 2 in children, but no loss of heterozygosity (LOH).¹⁷ Interestingly, all these 4 patients had large corticotropinomas with high Ki-67 proliferation indices and difficult to manage disease.

Chromosomal instability is a hallmark of tumorigenesis. The pituitary tumour transforming gene (PTTG) encodes for securin that regulates sister chromatid separation during metaphase. PTTG is overexpressed in pituitary adenomas, including CD, and is associated with tumour aggressiveness.¹⁸

Growth factors and their receptors contribute in tumour progression. A prototype growth factor is the epithelial growth factor (EGF) that in pituitary gland plays an important role regulating hormone secretion and cellular proliferation. Corticotropinomas express the highest levels of EGF receptor, and this negatively correlates with p27/kip1 immunoreactivity.¹⁹ Epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) overexpressing corticotropinoma cells develop larger tumours when xenografted in nude mice and induce CD that can be managed with EGFR small molecule inhibitors.²⁰ These findings confirm the important role of EGFR in corticotropinoma tumorigenesis and suggest a potential usefulness of EGFR-targeting pharmaceuticals for the management of CD.

Another important growth factor family that is involved in differentiation and tumorigenesis is the fibroblast growth factors (FGFs). FGF is released from pituitary tumour cells including corticopinomas.²¹ The FGF receptor 4 is overexpressed in CD.²² Functional FGFR4 polymorphisms have been linked either to silent macrotropinomas (R388) or to small hormonally active CD tumours (G388).²³ The FGFR-G388 was associated with lower postoperative remission rate in patients with CD.²²

Cytokines and their receptors are expressed in the anterior pituitary and regulate hormone production and cell proliferation.²⁴ IL-6 stimulates both ACTH secretion and POMC gene expression in human corticotropinoma cell cultures.²⁵ Leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) is a pleiotropic immune cytokine that enhances POMC transcription in synergy with corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH).²⁶ Transgenic LIF overexpression results in corticotroph hyperplasia, hypercortisolism and Cushingoid features.²⁷ No mutations were found in the gene encoding for LIF receptor in the 7 corticotropinomas analysed.²⁸

The overexpression of growth factors, cytokines and their receptors observed in corticotroph tumours suggest that intracellular signalling cascades may also be overactivated. There is evidence that the ERK kinase cascade may play a role in promoting corticotroph tumour growth as use of the MEK-162 inhibitor displayed antiproliferative and antisecretory action in vitro and in vivo.²⁹ The survival PI3K/Akt pathway is overactivated in corticotroph tumours to a similar extent as other pituitary tumour entities.³⁰

Tumour progression may also be triggered by the untimely mis-expression of developmental factors in the adult tissue. The noggin/bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) was picked during differential display searching for causative genes in an animal model of pituitary

tumours.³¹ BMP4 inhibits ACTH secretion and corticotroph tumour growth and its expression is reduced in CD tumours.³² Interestingly, BMP4 was found to mediate the antiproliferative and antisecretory action of retinoic acid and somatostatin analogues revealing its promise as therapeutic target.³²,³³

Sonic hedgehog (SHH) signalling plays a role in early pituitary differentiation and its expression in the adult normal pituitary is restricted to the corticotroph cells, where it crosstalks with CRH to induce POMC transcription and ACTH secretion.³⁴ SHH suppresses corticotroph cell proliferation and is absent in CD tumours, suggesting its role as a tumour suppressor.³⁵

PAX7 is involved in the differentiation of the melanotroph lineage by suppressing corticotroph-specific genes. PAX7 expression is absent from the human pituitary gland but was detected in 10% of human corticotropinomas.³⁶

Recent studies have highlighted the role of noncoding RNA transcripts, microRNAs (miRNAs), on the regulation of gene expression and subsequently functions such as proliferation and differentiation. CD tumours have a distinct miRNA expression profile that distinguishes them from the other pituitary tumour types, with the miR-30s being over-expressed.³⁷ The miRNAs -let7a, -15a, -16, -21, -141, -143, -145 and -150 are expressed in the normal pituitary but downregulated in corticotropinomas.³⁸ In contrast, miRNA-26a is significantly overexpressed in corticotropinomas resulting in suppression of protein kinase C delta (PRKCD) and increased cell cycle progression.³⁹ miRNA-122 and -493 are significantly upregulated in corticotroph carcinomas vs adenomas.⁴⁰ miR-493 regulates, among others, the lectin galactoside-binding soluble 3 (LGALS3) gene that encodes for galectin 3, which is overexpressed in corticotropinomas and correlates with aggressiveness.⁴¹

### 1.2 | POMC regulation

POMC transcription is triggered by hypothalamic stimuli in the form of CRH and vasopressin. CRH receptor (CRHR1) is overexpressed in CD tumours compared to silent corticotropinomas.⁴² Corticotroph tumours express vasopressin V2 and V3 receptors (V2R and V3R), and no mutations were found in the gene encoding for V3R.⁴³,⁴⁴ Interestingly, VR1b was recently found to be the predominant receptor, suggesting that VR1b antagonists could be useful in the management of CD.⁴⁵

There is evidence that ACTH synthesis is also regulated by itself in an auto-feedback loop. Indeed, ACTH receptor is expressed in the normal pituitary, but lost in around 70% of corticotropinomas; interestingly, the tumours that did express the receptor had lower ACTH levels.⁴⁶

The stimulatory action of CRH on POMC transcription is mediated by several factors. The nerve growth factor IB or Nur77 is in the crossroad of both the stimulatory CRH and the inhibitory glucocorticoid feedback, and its transcript levels are higher in patients with overt CD compared to subclinical CD.⁴⁷ Another factor, the nuclear receptor testicular orphan receptor 4 (TR4 nuclear receptor subfamily 2, group C, member 2), binds to the POMC promoter and stimulates its transcription. TR4 is highly expressed in human corticotropinomas, and its overexpression in vitro and in vivo (xenografts) increased ACTH secretion and tumour growth.⁴⁸ Interestingly, TR4 was found to attenuate
glucocorticoid-induced POMC suppression by physically interacting with glucocorticoid receptor (GR).⁴⁹

### 1.3 | Glucocorticoid resistance

Resistance to the physiological negative feedback loop of the glucocorticoids to ACTH synthesis is a hallmark of CD.⁵⁰ However, genetic defects in the NR3C1 gene encoding for GR are rarely documented in CD. No mutations were reported in the coding and exon-intron boundary region of NR3C1 in 18 corticotropinomas.⁵¹,⁵² Two polymorphisms were found in 4 tumours but did not correlate with tumour size or clinical course. A heterozygous frame shift somatic mutation in the GR gene was reported in a patient with Nelson’s syndrome and, interestingly, a heterozygous missense germline mutation was reported in a patient affected by glucocorticoid resistance syndrome, who developed CD at the age of 38 years.⁵³,⁵⁴

Other studies on glucocorticoid resistance have focused on the transcriptional regulation of POMC repression by GR. Brahma-related gene 1 (Brg1) and histone deacetylase HDAC2, 2 regulators of chromatin remodelling, are downregulated in corticotropinomas, and this compromises the ability of glucocorticoids to repress POMC transcription resulting in glucocorticoid resistance.⁵⁵,⁵⁶

Deregulated cortisol metabolism in corticotropinoma cells could also contribute to resistance: CD tumours express high levels of 11-β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 2 (11β-HSD2) that inactivates cortisol to cortisone.⁵⁷

The shuttling of ligand-bound GR to the nucleus and hence its transcriptional activation are tightly regulated by chaperons like the 90 kDa heat-shock protein HSP90. A recent study showed HSP90 overexpression in corticotropinomas that impaired the ability of glucocorticoids to repress POMC transcription and contributed to the glucocorticoid resistance. Interestingly, the C-terminal HSP90 inhibitor silibinin, which allows the separation of GR from HSP90, restored GR transcriptional activity and glucocorticoid sensitivity and ameliorated CD in vitro and in vivo.⁵⁸

A study comparing transcript levels of important in corticotroph pathophysiology factors between CD and silent corticotroph tumours showed that CD tumours overexpress CRHR1, V1bR, 11β-HSD2 and the prohormone convertases 1 and 3 (PC1/3) that cleave the POMC prohormone but did not detect differences in GRα expression.⁵⁹ Further separating the CD tumours in micro- and macroadenomas revealed that these differences in expression are evidenced only in microcorticotropinomas.⁶⁰ Table 1 summarizes genes and proteins deregulated in CD.

### 1.4 | Genetic syndromes associated with CD

CD rarely arises in the context of genetic familial syndromes (Table 2). Below, we list the few cases that were reported in the literature.

#### 1.4.1 | MEN 1 syndrome

Multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) 1 is characterized by primary hyperparathyroidism, pituitary adenomas and neuroendocrine tumours.

The driver mutation is an inactivating mutation of the MEN 1 suppressor gene that encodes for menin. Menin regulates p27/kip1 and cyclin-dependent kinase subunit 4 (CDK4) and inhibits cell cycle progression at G1. The prevalence of pituitary adenomas in MEN 1 ranges between 30% and 40% with PRL- and GH-secreting pituitary adenomas being the most frequent, whereas corticotropinomas are rarely found in MEN 1.⁶¹

In a comprehensive multicentre study of 324 patients with MEN 1 syndrome, 136 pituitary adenomas were identified, of which only 6 were corticotropinomas: 3 sporadic and 3 unrelated subjects in familiar MEN 1 setting. Three were macroadenomas (1 invasive), and 3 patients had persistent cortisol hypersecretion despite treatment.⁶² Another retrospective series of around 400 patients with MEN 1 syndrome reported 11 patients with corticotropinoma. The majority had microcorticotropinomas, and most of them were cured by transsphenoidal surgery; interestingly, 3 of 11 patients presented with additional noncorticotroph pituitary tumours.⁶³ CD was also reported in a MEN 1 patient with concomitant microcorticotropinoma and corticotrophin-releasing hormone producing thymic carcinoma.⁶⁴

An extremely rare combination of MEN 1 and corticotropinoma was reported in 2 Brazilian siblings, who had early-onset CD.⁶⁵ Corticotropinomas in paediatric patients with MEN 1 syndrome have been rarely described. In 3 paediatric patients aged 11–13 years, a microcorticotropinoma was the first manifestation of MEN 1 syndrome.⁶⁶ A paediatric cohort of 74 patients with sporadic CD and 4 patients with CD and a suspected genetic syndrome (2 unrelated patients with family history of genetically confirmed MEN 1 syndrome, 1 patient with clinical feature of MEN 1 syndrome and 1 patient with a TSC2 mutation) revealed MEN 1 mutations only in the 2 syndromic patients that had relatives with genetically confirmed MEN 1 syndrome and in none of the sporadic cases.⁶⁷

#### 1.4.2 | MEN 2 syndrome

Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2) is an autosomal dominant syndrome caused by an activating mutation of the proto-oncogene RET.⁶⁸ MEN2a syndrome is typified by parathyroid adenomas, medullary thyroid carcinomas and pheochromocytomas, whereas MEN2b is characterized by medullary thyroid cancer, pheochromocytoma, multiple mucosal neuromas, intestinal ganglioneuromas and marfanoid habitus. To date, only 2 cases of CD in patients with MEN 2 syndrome have been reported: a case in an adult patient with MEN2A and one in a paediatric patient with MEN2B syndrome. In both cases, CD was caused by a microcorticotropinoma.⁶⁹,⁷⁰

#### 1.4.3 | MEN 4 syndrome

MEN 4 syndrome is a very rare MEN1-like condition caused by a nonsense inactivating mutation in the CDKN1B gene (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1B) coding for p27/Kip1.⁷¹ Most studies showed no mutations in the CDKN1B gene in patients with CD, including paediatric.⁶⁷,⁷²,⁷³ Immunohistochemistry revealed the absence p27/kip1 immunoreactivity in 1 patient with malignant corticotropinoma.⁷²

An association between the p27 rs2066827 (V109G) polymorphism and corticotroph tumours was found in a large cohort of 447 Brazilian patients affected by different endocrine tumours, including 91 corticotropinomas. ${}^{75}$

### 1.4.4 McCune-Albright syndrome (MAS)

McCune-Albright syndrome (MAS) is caused by a mosaicism of activating somatic mutations in the GNAS1 oncogene (guanine nucleotide binding protein, alpha stimulating), encoding for the α subunit of the stimulatory G protein, Gs. Clinical characteristics include polyostotic fibrous dysplasia, café-au-lait skin pigmentation and endocrine glands hyperfunction. However, the hypercortisolism that might occur in these patients is mainly due to adrenal Cushing's syndrome as a consequence of adrenal hyperplasia or adenoma. Only few cases of somatic GNAS1 mutations were reported in corticotroph tumours, including an 11-year-old girl with CD. ${}^{76,77}$

### 1.4.5 Carney complex (CNC)

Carney complex (CNC) is caused in 70% of the cases by inactivating mutations in the PRKAR1A gene encoding for the 1 alpha regulatory subunit of the c-AMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA). ${}^{78}$ Myxomas, spotty skin pigmentation, schwannomas and endocrine tumours classically characterize CNC, while hypercortisolism is ACTH-independent as consequence of adrenal hyperplasia. ${}^{79}$ However, very recently, the first case of ACTH-dependent hypercortisolism secondary to a corticotropinoma was reported in a 31-year-old patient with CNC that presented a de novo heterozygous germline mutation in exon 2 of the PRKAR1A gene and a partial loss of the wild-type allele in the tumour indicative of a loss of heterozygosity. ${}^{80}$

### 1.4.6 Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC)

Tuberous sclerosis complex is caused by germline mutations in 2 tumour suppressor genes, TSC1 which encodes for hamartin or TSC2, which encodes for tuberin. The 2 proteins inhibit mTOR that triggers cell growth and cellular metabolism. TSC is characterized by the development of multiple hamartomas in several organs. To date, 2 cases of CD within TSC were reported: 1 in a 32-year-old man and 1 in a 13-year-old child.81,82

### 1.4.7 DICER1 syndrome

DICER1 syndrome is caused by mutations in the DICER1 gene, which encodes for cytoplasmic endoribonuclease type III that cleaves precursor microRNA (miRNAs) into short, functional miRNAs. It is associated with a pleiotropic early-onset tumour syndrome that includes among others pleuropulmonary blastoma, cystic nephroma, ovarian Sertoli-Leydig cell tumours, uterine cervical sarcoma, ciliary body medulloepithelioma, pineoblastoma, thyroid cancer and pituitary blastoma. To date, cases of pituitary blastoma causing severe CD have been reported in infants aged 9–13 months carrying DICER1 mutations.83–85

### 1.4.8 Dax1

A 33-year-old man with X-linked adrenal hypoplasia congenital, carrying a germline frame shift mutation in the gene encoding for DAX1 (NR0B1), presented with hyperpigmentation and an invasive macrocorticotropinoma. The histological findings showed a tumour mass and not hyperplasia. DAX1 plays a key role in the development and function of adrenal and reproductive system, but whether it may play a role in corticotroph tumorigenesis is still unclear.86

### 1.4.9 Familial isolated pituitary adenomas (FIPA)

Familial isolated pituitary adenomas (FIPA) describes the occurrence of pituitary adenomas in family members. Mutations in the aryl hydrocarbon receptor-interacting protein (AIP) gene have been described in 20% of FIPA families.87 CD is very rare in FIPA. Germline AIP mutations are rarely found in patients with CD.88,89

A screening of 443 patients affected by apparently sporadic pituitary adenomas, including 44 corticotropinomas revealed germline AIP mutations in 3 patients with CD: 2 patients with a microadenoma and one with a macroadenoma.89 A germline AIP mutation was also reported in a 50-year-old patient with an aggressive macrotropinoma and family history of pituitary disease.90 Similarly, screening of paediatric patients with CD revealed AIP mutation in only 1 case.67

Analysis of genes potentially associated with FIPA (AIP, CDKN1B, MEN1, PRKAR1A, SDHA, SDHB, SDHC and SDHD) revealed only a rare germline variant of uncertain significance in the SDHB gene in an unaffected patient with family history of CD.91

### 1.5 Somatic genetic events

Mutations in known proto-oncogenes or tumour suppressor genes are rarely reported. One study of 3 corticotropinomas and 4 ACTH-secreting carcinomas showed mutations in the p53 gene in 2 of the carcinomas.92 Another case has been reported of somatic p53

mutation in a patient with an invasive corticotroph tumour and difficult to treat CD. 93

In 2015, using next generation sequencing, we discovered a somatic mutational hotspot in the gene encoding for the ubiquitin-specific protease 8 (USP8). 4 An independent investigation in an Asian population identified exactly the same mutational hotspot confirming its importance in CD. 6 Subsequent multicentric studies in large CD cohorts revealed the incidence of USP8 mutation to be between 35% and 60%. 4-8 The USP8 gene encodes for a deubiquitinase that plays a crucial role in regulating the stability of tyrosine kinases receptors, such as EGFR. All mutations identified so far are located in a hotspot region in exon 14 that binds to the 14-3-3 protein family and therefore impair their binding. Loss of 14-3-3 binding makes USP8 susceptible to proteolytic cleavage and allows the formation of a C-terminal 40-kDa fragment with higher catalytic capacity.

We and other have shown that the activated USP8 deubiquitates EGFR protecting it from lysosomal degradation, leading to increased EGFR stability and maintaining its downstream signalling pathways in an active state. 4,6 Investigations in human CD revealed higher EGFR transcript and immunoreactivity in USP8 mutated corticotropinoma cells. 6 A subsequent investigation however, did not detect differences in EGFR expression as determined by immunohistochemistry in USP8 mutant vs wild-type tumours (Figure 1). 7 Interestingly this study showed increased transcript levels of POMC, somatostatin receptor subtype 5 (SSTR5) and O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) in the USP8 mutant corticotropinomas. This observation

FIGURE 1 USP8 wild-type vs USP8 mutant cell. USP8 potentiates EGFR signalling in corticotroph tumour cells. Upon ligand binding, EGFR gets ubiquitinated and targeted to the lysosome. USP8 deubiquitates EGFR, rescuing it from lysosomal degradation and promoting its recycling to the cell membrane where it is able to bind EGF and transduce its stimulatory action on ACTH synthesis. In corticotroph tumour cells with wild-type USP8 (USP8wt), (A) 14-3-3 proteins bind to USP8, blocking its accessibility to proteases and preventing its full activation. In contrast, (B) the presence of a mutation in the hotspot prevents 14-3-3 from binding to USP8, rendering it accessible to proteases that cleave it to a peptide fragment with high deubiquitinase activity. These highly potent USP8 mutants effectively deubiquitinate EGFR, potentiating its signalling and subsequently ACTH synthesis 4 [Colour figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com]

suggests that patients with USP8 mutant corticotropinomas may respond better to SSTR5-targeting somatostatin analogues, such as pasireotide.⁷

To date, mutations of the USP8 gene have been detected only in CD. All mutations identified so far are somatic heterozygous single point mutations. No germline USP8 mutations have been reported, most likely because they are lethal. All studies report a higher prevalence of USP8 mutations in female patients with CD. This could be secondary to an oestrogenic effect on USP8-mutated cells. Regarding clinical, biochemical, radiological and histological features, few associations have been reported and none of them has been corroborated by the other studies. Very recently somatic mutations in USP8 gene have been identified in 31% paediatric patients. In this study, biochemical profile, tumour size and frequency of cavernous sinus invasion of patients harbouring USP8 mutations were not significantly different from those without USP8 mutation. On the other hand, patients with USP8 mutations were older at diagnosis had lower BMI and, interestingly, recurrence of disease occurred only in patients harbouring USP8 mutations.⁸ Recently, a small molecule USP8 inhibitor was able to reduce EGFR, ERBB2 and Met expression and ACTH secretion and to promote apoptosis and suppress growth in a corticotroph tumour cell line.⁹⁴

The search for genetic causes of pituitary tumours led to the discovery of additional genes such as the gene encoding for the orphan G protein-coupled receptor (GPR101) that shows germline duplication in patients with X-linked acrogigantism.⁹⁵ Screening a cohort of paediatric CD did not reveal germline or somatic GPR101 mutations.⁹⁶ GPR101 transcript levels were not deregulated in corticotropinomas compared to the normal pituitary. In addition, whole exome sequencing revealed a germline missense mutation in the gene encoding for cadherin-related 23 (CDH23) in both familial and sporadic pituitary adenomas, including 4 of 20 corticotropinomas.⁹⁷ Finally, a recent transcriptomic analysis of 12 corticotropinomas revealed differences between invasive macroadenomas and non-invasive micro/macroadenomas.⁹⁸ Among the genes highlighted were cyclin D2 (CCND2) and Zinc-finger 676 protein (ZNF676) that were increased and death-associated protein kinase 1 (DAPK1) and metalloproteinase inhibitor 2 (TIMP2) that were decreased in the invasive CD tumours.

do not expect to identify a second major mutational hotspot like USP8, but rather low-frequency mutational events. This might be similar to the outcome of exome sequencing in GH-secreting pituitary tumours that confirmed in 40% of cases the known mutations in the GNAS encoding for the stimulatory G protein alpha subunit and showed mutations in single genes in the rest of the cases, rather than another mutational hotspot.⁹⁹ These genes, however, when considered together highlight the “addiction” of acromegalic tumours to the c-AMP and calcium signalling pathways. Similarly, we expect that our efforts will highlight pathways that drive and sustain corticotroph tumour formation. This will ultimately, more than 100 years after the description of the first patient, Minnie G., by Harvey Cushing solve the genetic riddle of this disease.

2 | CONCLUSIONS

In the last few years, major progress has been made to better understand the molecular pathogenesis of CD. The recent discovery of somatic mutations in the USP8 gene represents an important progress to detect the genetic alterations underlying CD and to develop new diagnostic and therapeutic tools. At present, further studies are necessary to determine if this has implication for clinical care, to clarify controversies of genotype-phenotype correlations and to identify additional pathways activated by mutant USP8 cells. Finally, driver mutations in the remaining 40%-60% of USP8 wild-type corticotropinomas will likely be identified using NGS. We
