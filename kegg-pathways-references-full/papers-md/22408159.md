*Escherichia coli* K-12 WcaJ and the *Caulobacter crescentus* HfsE, PssY, and PssZ enzymes are predicted to initiate the synthesis of colanic acid (CA) capsule and holdfast polysaccharide, respectively. These proteins belong to a prokaryotic family of membrane enzymes that catalyze the formation of a phosphoanhydride bond joining a hexose-1-phosphate with undecaprenyl phosphate (Und-P). In this study, *in vivo* complementation assays of an *E. coli* K-12 *wcaJ* mutant demonstrated that WcaJ and PssY can complement CA synthesis. Furthermore, WcaJ can restore holdfast production in *C. crescentus*. *In vitro* transferase assays demonstrated that both WcaJ and PssY utilize UDP-glucose but not UDP-galactose. However, in a strain of *Salmonella enterica* serovar Typhimurium deficient in the WbaP O antigen initiating galactosyltransferase, complementation with WcaJ or PssY resulted in O-antigen production. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) revealed the attachment of both CA and O-antigen molecules to lipid A-core oligosaccharide (OS). Therefore, while UDP-glucose is the preferred substrate of WcaJ and PssY, these enzymes can also utilize UDP-galactose. This unexpected feature of WcaJ and PssY may help to map specific residues responsible for the nucleotide diphosphate specificity of these or similar enzymes. Also, the reconstitution of O-antigen synthesis in *Salmonella*, CA capsule synthesis in *E. coli*, and holdfast synthesis provide biological assays of high sensitivity to examine the sugar-1-phosphate transferase specificity of heterologous proteins.

The biogenesis of bacterial cell surface polysaccharides requires a large number of proteins that include glycosyltransferases, translocases, transporters, polymerases, and ligases. The pathway for assembly of the glycan precursors varies according to the type of glycan and the bacterial species; however, the majority of polysaccharides share an initiation step requiring a UDP sugar and the undecaprenyl-phosphate (Und-P) lipid carrier (51, 54). The initiation reaction forms a phosphoanhydride bond between the 1-phosphate residue of Und-P and the sugar-1-phosphate, resulting in the release of UMP. Cytoplasmic membrane proteins that catalyze the initiation reaction are broadly separated into two families: the polyisoprenyl-phosphate N-acetylaminosugar-1-phosphate transferases (PNPTs) and the polyisoprenyl-phosphate hexose-1-phosphate transferases (PHPTs) (51). PNPTs also include eukaryotic members that initiate the synthesis of glycans involved in N-protein glycosylation. WecA is the prototypic prokaryotic member of the PNPT family and initiates O-antigen synthesis in enteric bacteria such as *Escherichia coli* (1), *Klebsiella pneumoniae* O1 (5), and *Shigella dysenteriae* (18). The O antigen is the outermost component of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) molecule, a major constituent of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria (35, 50), and the rest of the LPS is made of lipid A-core oligosaccharide (OS), which provides the attachment site for the O-antigen polymers. WecA also initiates the synthesis of enterobacterial common antigen (ECA) (25).

Unlike PNPT proteins, the PHPT family contains only prokaryotic members. One example is WbaP, which initiates O-antigen synthesis in *Salmonella enterica* (31, 32, 39, 52) and capsular polysaccharide synthesis in *E. coli* O9:K30 (7). *E. coli* K-12 WcaJ and *Caulobacter crescentus* HfsE, PssY, and PssZ have been assigned to the PHPT family based on amino acid sequence similarities. WcaJ is predicted to initiate the synthesis of colanic acid (CA) by transferring α-D-glucose-1-phosphate (Glc-1-P) to Und-P (44), but this function has not been established biochemically or genetically. Unlike O antigen, which is attached to the cell surface via lipid A-core OS, cell surface CA has no identified lipid anchor and is loosely associated with the outer membrane. Under certain conditions, CA molecules can be attached covalently to lipid A-core OS (26), resulting in $CA_{LPS}$. In this case, CA units are attached to a terminal heptose residue in the core OS (26), which is the normal attachment site recognized by the WaaL O-antigen ligase (10). Furthermore, $CA_{LPS}$ accumulates in *E. coli* strains with mutations in the LPS export pathway (42), and this process requires WaaL ligase function. CA is produced by various species of enteric bacteria and contributes to biofilm formation (45). Production of CA is controlled by a complex regulatory cascade that ultimately determines the level of transcription of the *cps* (capsular polysaccharide synthesis) gene cluster (12).

In the Gram-negative aquatic bacterium *Caulobacter crescentus*, HfsE, PssY, and PssZ are proposed to initiate the synthesis of glycans required for the production of the holdfast adhesin, but

these three proteins are believed to be redundant based on genetic complementation assays in a *C. crescentus ΔhfsE ΔpssY ΔpssZ* mutant (46). During cell division, *C. crescentus* produces a motile swarmer cell containing a flagellum and pili at the same pole and a nonmotile cell which adheres to surfaces via a stalk tipped with the holdfast adhesin (21). The swarmer cell retracts its pili, sheds the flagellum, and produces a holdfast and stalk (4). Although the exact composition and structure of holdfast remain unknown, previous work has determined that it contains polysaccharides, proteins, and uronic acid (28, 49). Thus far, the only sugar identified in the holdfast polysaccharide is β-1-4-linked N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), based on its sensitivity to lysozyme and chitinase, both of which cleave β-1-4 linkages in GlcNAc polymers, and its specific binding to the lectin wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), which recognizes GlcNAc polymers (28).

In this study, we investigated the function of WcaJ, HfsE, PssY, and PssZ and determined that both WcaJ and PssY act as UDP-Glc:Und-P Glc-1-P transferases. *In vivo* complementation assays also demonstrated the requirement of WcaJ for CA production in *E. coli* K-12 and the ability of WcaJ to complement holdfast production in a triple *hfsE pssY pssZ* mutant strain of *C. crescentus*. Overexpression of WcaJ and PssY in a *wbaP* mutant of *S.* enterica serovar Typhimurium led to the attachment of both O antigen and CA to lipid A-core OS, suggesting that these proteins also have a low level of galactose-1-phosphate (Gal-1-P) transferase activity.

### MATERIALS AND METHODS

**Bacterial strains.** Table 1 lists the bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study. *S. enterica* and *E. coli* were grown at 37°C in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium (Difco) (10 mg/ml tryptone, 5 mg/ml yeast extract, 5 mg/ml NaCl). Growth medium was supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin, 20 to 30 μg/ml chloramphenicol, 40 μg/ml kanamycin, or 10 μg/ml tetracycline as appropriate. *C. crescentus* strains were grown at 30°C in peptone-yeast extract (PYE) broth or on PYE agar (34). For strains containing xylose-inducible constructs, PYE was supplemented with 0.3% glucose for repression of expression or 0.03% xylose for induction of expression. Growth medium was supplemented with kanamycin at 1.25 μg/ml and 5 μg/ml for liquid and solid media, respectively, and with 0.5 μg/ml and 1 μg/ml chloramphenicol for liquid and solid media, respectively. Nalidixic acid was used at 20 μg/ml in PYE agar for selection of *Caulobacter* during conjugation with *E. coli*.

**Molecular cloning and DNA sequencing.** Plasmid DNA was isolated using a Qiaprep Spin miniprep kit (Qiagen Inc.). Digestion with restriction enzymes, ligation with T4 ligase, and transformations were carried out as described previously (22). Plasmids were introduced into *C. crescentus* by conjugation (8, 9). DNA sequences were determined at the York University Core Molecular Biology and DNA Sequencing Facility, Toronto, Ontario, Canada, and the Indiana Molecular Biology Institute, Indiana University, Bloomington, IN. PCR amplifications were carried out with PwoI DNA polymerase (Roche Diagnostics).

**Construction of plasmids and mutants.** The oligonucleotides used for these experiments are listed in Table S1 in the supplemental material. Mutagenesis to disrupt specific chromosomal genes was performed by the method of Datsenko and Wanner (6). For these experiments, *E. coli* W3110 and *S.* Typhimurium MSS2 carrying pKD46 were transformed by electroporation with a PCR product that was generated using plasmid pKD4 as a template and the primer pair 4589-4590 to construct XBF1 or 5029-5037 to construct KBP10. Plasmid pXF1 was constructed by PCR amplification of a 1,429-bp fragment with primer pair 4587-4588 and *E. coli* W3110 DNA as the template. This fragment was digested with NcoI and XbaI and ligated into the corresponding sites of pBAD24. Plasmid pKP21 was constructed by PCR amplification of a 1,446-bp fragment with primer pair 3308-3309 and pJD132 as the template. The amplicon was digested with SmaI and ligated into the SmaI site in pBADNTF. pHfsE, pPssY, and pPssZ were constructed by PCR amplification of 1,156-bp, 832-bp, and 595-bp fragments, respectively, using *C. crescentus* CB15 DNA and primer pairs HfsEstartXbaI-HfsEstopHindIII, PssYstartXbaI-PssYstopHindIII, and PssZstartXbaI-PssZstopHindIII, respectively. Each of the resulting amplicons was digested with XbaI and HindIII and ligated into the corresponding sites of pBADNTF. Plasmids pKP101, pKP102, and pKP113 were all constructed in a similar manner, by PCR amplifications with primer pairs 4520-258 (886-bp fragment), 4522-258 (649-bp fragment), and 4877-258 (1,476-bp fragment), respectively, and the corresponding DNA templates pPssY, pPssZ, and pXF1. Each of these amplicons was digested with HindIII and ligated into the same site of pEB-T7 to generate N-terminal fusions of each of the target proteins with the TrxA tag. Plasmids pKP103 and pKP104 were constructed by PCR amplification with primer pairs 3601-3602 (1,403-bp fragment) and 3601-3602 (1,166-bp fragment), respectively, using pKP101 and pKP102 as templates. Each of the appropriate fragments was digested with NcoI and ligated into this site and the SmaI site of pBAD24. pUJ142 constructs encoding WcaJ, FLAG-WcaJ, FLAG-HfsE, FLAG-PssY, and FLAG-PssZ were created by digestion of pLA3, pXF-1, pHfsE, pPssY, and pPssZ, respectively, with EcoRI and HindIII and ligation of the inserts into the corresponding sites of pUJ142. All recombinant plasmids were verified by DNA sequencing.

**Total membrane preparation and immunoblotting.** For visualization of epitope-tagged proteins, bacterial cultures grown at 37°C overnight in 5 ml of LB broth were diluted to an optical density at 600 nm (*OD*~600~) of 0.2 and incubated for another 2 h, until reaching an *OD*~600~ of 0.6. Arabinose or IPTG (isopropyl-β-*d*-thiogalactopyranoside), as appropriate, was added to a final concentration of 0.2% (wt/vol) or 400 μM, respectively. For arabinose induction, bacteria were incubated for 3 h at 37°C until reaching an *OD*~600~ of approximately 0.8 to 1.0. For IPTG induction, bacteria were incubated for 5 h at 30°C. Bacterial cells were harvested by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C. The bacterial pellet was suspended in Tris-NaCl buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 300 mM NaCl) containing protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Diagnostics) and disrupted by passages through a French pressure cell. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation (15,000 × g, 15 min, 4°C), and the clear supernatant was centrifuged at 40,000 × g for 30 min at 4°C. The pellet, containing total membranes, was suspended in Tris-NaCl buffer. The protein concentration was determined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). SDS-PAGE, protein transfers to nitrocellulose membranes, and immunoblots were performed as described previously (33). For detection of 6×His- and FLAG-tagged proteins, the nitrocellulose membranes were incubated with 1:10,000 dilutions of anti-His IgG2a (Amersham) and anti-FLAG (Sigma) monoclonal antibodies, respectively.

**Detection of holdfast in *C. crescentus*.** To determine the presence and functionality of holdfast, a short-term binding assay using 12-well polystyrene plates and crystal violet staining was performed as previously described (15). To detect the presence of holdfast on *C. crescentus* cells, a WGA binding assay was performed on cells in liquid culture, using fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled WGA (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) at a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml as previously described (16, 28). Fluorescent bacteria were observed by epifluorescence microscopy on a Nikon Eclipse 800 light microscope equipped with a Nikon B-2E FITC filter cube for FITC and a 100× Plan Apo oil objective (numerical aperture [NA], 1.4). Images were captured using a Photometrics Cascade 1K EMCCD camera and Elements Imaging software, version 3.22.

**Small-scale LPS extraction and analysis.** Culture samples were adjusted to an *OD*~600~ of 2.0 in a final volume of 100 μl. Proteinase K-digested whole-cell lysates were then prepared as described elsewhere (24), and LPS was separated in 14% acrylamide gels by use of a Tricine-SDS buffer system (20). Gel loading was normalized so that each sample corresponded to the same number of bacterial cells. Each well was loaded with approximately 1 × 10^8^ CFU. Gels were stained with silver nitrate by a

phenol-chloroform-light petroleum (2/5/8 [vol/vol/vol]) as described by Brade and Galanos (3). Samples were purified by ultracentrifugation (105,000 × g, 4 h, 4°C), and the pellet (LPS) was lyophilized and used for analysis. For determination of neutral sugars, 500 μg of each LPS was hydrolyzed in 250 μl 2 M trifluoroacetic acid at 120°C for 2 h. Next, samples were reduced overnight with 2 mg NaBH₄ in water and peracetylated with acetic anhydride and pyridine (1:1 [vol/vol]) at 85°C for 45 min to yield volatile sugar alditol acetate derivatives. Samples were dissolved in chloroform and separated on a CP-Sil 88 column (WCOT-fused silica; 25 m × 0.25 mm) fitted to a Varian 3800 gas chromatograph equipped with a Varian 220-MS ion-trap mass spectrometer. Samples (1 μl) were injected in split mode (split ratio, 1:10) and eluted with the following oven temperature program: initial temperature of 190°C (held for 4 min following injection) raised 4°C/min to 230°C and then held for 11 min. The injection port was heated to 250°C. High-purity He was used as a carrier gas. Compounds were identified by their retention time and mass spectrum, as well as by comparison to authentic monosaccharide samples that had been converted into their corresponding alditol acetates. The retention times of analyzed sugars were compared with glucose, galactose, mannose, fucose, and rhamnose standards.

**In vitro transferase activity.** Total membranes were isolated from parental, mutant, and tester strains containing vector controls or plasmids expressing proteins. The in vitro assay was adopted from the work of Schäffer et al. (40), with modifications. The reaction mixture contained 0.2 mg of total membrane protein, with 0.025 μCi UDP-[α-D-¹⁴C]galactose (UDP-[¹⁴C]Gal) (specific activity, 300 mCi/mmol; Amersham Biosciences), UDP-[α-D-¹⁴C]glucose (UDP-[¹⁴C]Glc) (specific activity, 302 mCi/mmol; PerkinElmer), or UDP-[α-D-¹⁴C]N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-[¹⁴C]GlcNAc) (specific activity, 300 mCi/mmol; Amersham Biosciences) in 100 μl buffer (40 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 0.5 mM EDTA, 20 mM MgCl₂). After incubation at 37°C for 30 min, the reaction was stopped with 500 μl of chloroform-methanol (3/2 [vol/vol]). To extract the lipid phase, the mixture was shaken vigorously for 3 min and centrifuged for 2 min at 14,000 × g. The lower, organic phase was collected, and 55 μl of 40 mM MgCl₂ was added, followed by 5 min of vigorous shaking. The mixture was centrifuged as before, and the top phase was removed. The organic phase was washed twice with 400 μl of pure solvent upper phase (PSUP) (18/294/293/1 chloroform-methanol-water-1 M MgCl₂ [vol/vol/vol/vol]). For scintillation counting, half of the organic phase was added to 5 ml of scintillation fluid. For thin-layer chromatography (TLC), half of the organic phase was dried overnight, resuspended in 10 μl of chloroform-methanol (2/1 [vol/vol]), and spotted on a Whatman silica gel (PE Sil G) plate that was prerun in chloroform-methanol (3/2 [vol/vol]). The lipid-linked products were separated using a chloroform-methanol-water (64/25/1 [vol/vol/vol]) solvent system. After drying and exposure of the plate to a phosphorimager screen overnight, product formation was detected with a phosphorimager (Storm 840; Amersham Biosciences) equipped with Image-Quant software.

**RESULTS**

WcaJ is required for CA synthesis. The chemical structure of the CA subunit (Fig. 1) suggests that glucose is the initiating sugar for its synthesis (11, 26). WcaJ is the only candidate protein encoded by the *E. coli* K-12 *cps* cluster that has features of a polyisoprenyl-phosphate hexose-1-phosphate transferase (44) and therefore could be the initiating enzyme for CA synthesis. Supporting this notion, WcaJ shares amino acid sequence conservation and a similar predicted topology with WbaP (Fig. 2 and data not shown). To confirm that WcaJ plays a role in CA synthesis, we deleted *wcaJ* from the *E. coli* K-12 strain W3110 and examined the *wcaJ* null strain for the absence of a mucoid phenotype. Because the expression of *E. coli* genes required for CA production is poor in LB medium at 37°C, we overexpressed RcsA, a positive transcriptional regulator of CA gene expression (17, 47). A plasmid carrying the *rcsA* gene (pWQ499) (Table 1) was introduced into the parental W3110 strain and the Δ*wcaJ* mutant. Overexpression of RcsA in the W3110 and Δ*wcaJ* strains resulted in mucoid and nonmucoid colonies, respectively (Fig. 3A). The Δ*wcaJ* (RcsA⁺) mutant became mucoid upon introduction of a plasmid-carried *wcaJ* gene under the control of an arabinose-inducible promoter (Fig. 3B and Table 2). This result demonstrates that WcaJ is required for CA production.

**C. crescentus PssY complements CA synthesis in the *E. coli* Δ*wcaJ* mutant.** The construction of the Δ*wcaJ* mutant provided us with a biological assay to investigate the function of any putative UDP-Glc:Und-P Glc-1-P transferase that could be expressed

Bacteria were incubated overnight at 37°C on LB plates with no antibiotics (W3110) or with 10 μg/ml tetracycline (to maintain pWQ499). (B) Complementation of the *wcaJ* deletion mutant containing pWQ499 (*RcsA*⁺) with a control plasmid (pBAD24) and plasmids encoding WcaJ, the putative Glc-1-P transferases HfsE, PssY, and PssZ, and the Gal-1-P transferase WbaP. Cells were streaked on LB agar plates containing 0.2% arabinose, 10 μg/ml tetracycline (to maintain pWQ499), and 100 μg/ml ampicillin (to maintain the recombinant plasmids encoding the transferases and the vector control pBAD24) and incubated overnight at 37°C.

in *E. coli* K-12. We investigated the role of *C. crescentus* HfsE, PssY, and PssZ, which are involved in holdfast synthesis. These proteins vary in size and number of transmembrane helices (Fig. 2), but all contain the C-terminal domain that is essential for catalytic activity in PHPT family members (32, 43, 52). HfsE has 375 amino acids and contains two predicted transmembrane helices (46). In contrast, PssY and PssZ are smaller proteins, of 267 and 188 amino acids, respectively, and they each contain one predicted transmembrane helix and the conserved C-terminal region. We investigated the ability of these proteins to restore CA production in the Δ*wcaJ* (*RcsA*⁺) mutant by using recombinant plasmids that encode each of these proteins under the control of an arabinose-inducible promoter. The transformants were examined on plates containing 0.2% (wt/vol) arabinose. Only PssY restored a mucoid phenotype to the Δ*wcaJ* (*RcsA*⁺) strain (Fig. 3B and Table 2). The absence of complementation by WbaP was consistent with the function of this protein as a Gal-1-P transferase (32), which would not be expected to participate in CA synthesis. The inability of HfsE and PssZ to complement the Δ*wcaJ* mutation could not be explained by differential protein expression. Indeed, HfsE was well expressed in membrane fractions of *E. coli* DH5α (Fig. 4A). In contrast, PssZ was expressed as poorly as PssY (Fig. 4A). We have demonstrated previously that adding an N-terminal thioredoxin (6×His-TrxA) protein of ~12 kDa to the C-terminal domain of WbaP (WbaP-CT) increases membrane expression and transferase activity (32); therefore, we created similar fusions with PssY and PssZ. Although the addition of 6×His-TrxA led to increased PssZ and PssY expression in total membrane fractions (Fig. 4B), PssZ was still unable to restore CA production (Table 2). A construct expressing HfsE without any added epitope tag was also unable to complement CA synthesis (data not shown). From these data, we concluded that PssY has the same function as WcaJ, while

HfsE and PssZ either are not functional in *E. coli* or have a different function that cannot be revealed in the Δ*wcaJ* (*RcsA*⁺) indicator strain.

*E. coli* WcaJ complements holdfast synthesis in a *C. crescentus* Δ*hfsE*Δ*pssY*Δ*pssZ* mutant. The ability of PssY to complement CA synthesis in *E. coli* may result from the ability of PssY to utilize more than one UDP-sugar. However, if holdfast synthesis is initiated by a glucose-1-phosphate transferase, we reasoned that WcaJ should be able to complement holdfast synthesis in a *C. crescentus* Δ*hfsE*Δ*pssY*Δ*pssZ* mutant. We also tested expression and activity of FLAG-tagged HfsE and PssZ to determine if the N-terminal FLAG epitope affected the activity of these proteins in *C. crescentus*. All proteins were expressed in the *C. crescentus* Δ*hfsE*Δ*pssY*Δ*pssZ* mutant and analyzed for holdfast production by polystyrene- and WGA-binding assays as described in Materials and Methods. All proteins except the FLAG-tagged HfsE protein were able to bind the lectin (Fig. 5A) and produce a biofilm that stained with crystal violet (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). Analyses of proteins from whole cells detected expression of HfsE, PssY, and PssZ (data not shown). These results demonstrate that the Glc-1-phosphate transferase activity of WcaJ can initiate holdfast production in *C. crescentus*.

In vitro sugar-1-phosphate transferase activity of PssY and WcaJ. CA synthesis is initiated by a Glc-1-P transfer reaction to Und-P, while O-antigen synthesis in *S.* Typhimurium starts with the transfer of Gal-1-P (31, 32, 39, 52), indicating that the enzymes responsible for the initiation reactions must differ in substrate specificity. Therefore, we investigated their enzymatic activity by using an in vitro transferase assay. Membranes were prepared from *E. coli* C43(DE3) cells expressing 6×His-TrxA-tagged N-terminal fusion derivatives of WcaJ (encoded by pKP113) or PssY (encoded by pKP103). Aliquots of membrane fractions were incubated with UDP-[¹⁴C]Gal or UDP-[¹⁴C]Glc. As controls, membrane fractions from *E. coli* C43(DE3) cells expressing WbaP-CT (encoded by pKP41) were incubated with UDP-[¹⁴C]Gal, and membranes from *E. coli* MV501(pKV1) expressing WecA were

incubated with UDP-[¹⁴C]GlcNAc (19). In this assay, membrane fractions provide both the enzyme and the endogenous Und-P acceptor. Total membranes from *E. coli* C43(DE3) and MV501 cells containing the pEB-T7 and pBAD24 cloning vectors, respectively, were used as negative controls. The lipid fractions containing the Und-P-P-sugar products were extracted with chloroform-methanol, separated by TLC, and scanned on a phosphorimager. The TLC analysis of chloroform-methanol-extractable lipids linked radiolabeled saccharides from membranes containing WcaJ and PssY revealed very strong spots, with an $R_f$ value of 0.66, which appeared only for reaction mixtures incubated with UDP-[¹⁴C]Glc (Fig. 6). Spots with similar $R_f$ values also appeared for reaction mixtures obtained from membranes containing WbaP-CT and WecA incubated with their corresponding radio-labeled nucleotide diphosphate substrates, i.e., UDP-[¹⁴C]Gal and UDP-[¹⁴C]GlcNAc, respectively, suggesting that all of these spots correspond to Und-P-P-linked sugars. A slower-migrating spot was also identified in reaction mixtures containing WbaP, WcaJ, and PssY. This was also observed with *Geobacillus stearothermophilus* WsaP, another PHPT protein (43). We speculate that this spot represents a possible breakdown product of the Und-P-P-linked sugar.

The in vitro assay also demonstrated that WcaJ and PssY utilize UDP-Glc but not UDP-Gal and, conversely, that WbaP is specific for UDP-Gal and cannot function with UDP-Glc. The latter conclusion is further supported by a detailed biochemical characterization of the enzymatic activity of purified WbaP-CT (31). HfsE and PssZ were also investigated and did not show any activity in this assay (data not shown).

Expression of PssY and WcaJ in a *wbaP*-deficient mutant results in the production of a mixture of lipid A-core OS molecules with covalently attached O antigen and CA. To explore whether HfsE and/or PssZ is functionally similar to the galactose-1-phosphate transferase WbaP, we introduced plasmids expressing HfsE, PssZ, and PssY into the S. Typhimurium *wbaP* deletion strain MSS2 and examined LPS O-antigen production. The three proteins were detected in total membrane fractions of the S. Typhimurium Δ*wbaP* strain at levels that were similar to their expression in *E. coli* DH5α (data not shown). Only bacteria containing PssY produced bands that migrated above the lipid A-core OS bands, corresponding to O-antigen polysaccharides of low molecular weight (Fig. 7A, top panel, lane 6). This was confirmed by reactivity with Salmonella group B O-specific rabbit antiserum (Fig. 7A, bottom panel, lane 6), which also revealed the presence of polymeric O antigen in this sample. This phenotype was identical to that observed with the C-terminal region of S. Typhimurium WbaP (WbaP-CT) (Fig. 7A, lane 3). Varying the concentration of arabinose in the culture medium (from 0.002 to 2% [wt/vol]) did not result in any change in the LPS samples from bacteria expressing.

FIG 6 In vitro transferase assay. Membranes prepared from *E. coli* C43(DE3) and MV501 were assayed for transferase activity with 0.025 μCi of UDP-[¹⁴C]Gal, UDP-[¹⁴C]Glc, or UDP-[¹⁴C]GlcNAc, as indicated. The lipid-associated fraction was extracted with a mixture of chloroform-methanol and separated by thin-layer chromatography on silica plates, using chloroform-methanol-water (65/25/4 [vol/vol/vol]) as the solvent system, as described in Materials and Methods. The membrane fractions were prepared from the following bacteria: pEBT7, C43(DE3)/pEB-T7 (negative control); WbaP-CT, C43(DE3)/pKP42 encoding 6×His-TrxA-tagged WbaP<sub>F258-Y476</sub>; PssY, C43(DE3)/pKP103 encoding 6×His-TrxA-tagged PssY; WcaJ, C43(DE3)/pKP113 encoding 6×His-TrxA-tagged WcaJ; pBAD24, MV501/pBAD24 (negative control); WecA, MV501/pKV1 encoding WecA. The radiolabeled UDP-sugars (0.0025 Ci) were also spotted on the TLC plate (asterisks). The arrow points to spots with *R<sub>f*</sub> values consistent with Und-P-P-Gal, Und-P-P-Glc, and Und-P-P-GlcNAc.

ing HfsE or PssZ (data not shown). Since PssZ and PssY proteins were better expressed when fused to the 6×His-TrxA tag (Fig. 5) (33), we also investigated the ability of these constructs to complement O-antigen synthesis. Only 6×His-TrxA-tagged PssY supported O-antigen production in the ΔwbaP mutant (Fig. 7A, compare lanes 4, 8, and 9).

Since PssY could complement O-antigen synthesis in the S. Typhimurium ΔwbaP strain, we investigated whether WcaJ could do the same. The S. Typhimurium ΔwbaP strain expressing WcaJ also produced O antigen (Fig. 7A, lane 10). S. Typhimurium contains an endogenous copy of *wcaJ* in the chromosome. Overexpression of S. Typhimurium genomic *wcaJ* by the RcsA-positive regulator also resulted in the production of O-antigen-like bands, as seen with PssY and WcaJ in the silver-stained gel (Fig. 7A, top panel, lane 11). However, LPS from this strain did not react with Salmonella group B O-antigen-specific rabbit antiserum (Fig. 7A, bottom panel, lane 11), suggesting that silver nitrate-reacting banding did not come from O antigen linked to lipid A-OS but rather from a different polysaccharide, presumably CA (see below). As a specificity control, we also probed the membrane with group D1 antiserum, which reacts specifically with S. Typhi O antigen. Only S. Typhi LPS reacted with the antiserum (Fig. 7B).

Since holdfast contains polymers of GlcNAc (28), we tested the possibility that the *C. crescentus* proteins could have either GlcNAc-1-P or GalNAc-1-P transferase activity by using the *E. coli* O7:K1 WecA-deficient strain MV501. WecA initiates O-antigen synthesis by transfer of GlcNAc-1-P to Und-P (25). Merino et al. (27) demonstrated that in MV501, *Aeromonas hydrophila* WecP can utilize UDP-GalNAc in the presence of a GalNAc epimerase (Gne). Therefore, we expressed each of the *C. crescentus* proteins in MV501, with and without coexpression of Gne. None of the proteins were able to restore O-antigen production as assayed by silver staining and O7 immunoblotting of LPS (see Fig. S2A and B in the supplemental material). Together, these experiments suggest that the *C. crescentus* PHPT proteins are not GlcNAc-1-P or GalNAc-1-P transferases and that PssY and WcaJ can partially complement the O-antigen defect in the S. Typhimurium ΔwbaP strain.

To chemically confirm the attachment of O antigen and/or CA to lipid A-core OS, we performed GC-MS analysis of purified LPS preparations. As expected, the wild-type S. Typhimurium LT2 LPS sample contained the sugars abequose, rhamnose, and mannose, which are unique to the chemical structure of the S. Typhimurium O antigen (Fig. 1). The samples of the S. Typhimurium ΔwbaP mutant expressing PssY or WcaJ contained abequose, rhamnose, mannose, and fucose. The last sugar is unique to the CA repeat (Fig. 1). In contrast, the LPS sample of the S. Typhimurium ΔwbaP mutant lacked O-antigen sugars and fucose. In addition, all LPS samples contained glucose and galactose, which are found in the core oligosaccharide (29). The GC-MS data support the conclusion that overexpression of WcaJ or PssY in the S. Typhimurium ΔwbaP mutant causes bacterial cells to produce a mixture of lipid A-core OS species with covalently attached O antigen or CA.

To provide additional support to the idea that CA<sub>LPS</sub> is formed, we constructed a *wcaA* deletion mutant in the S. Typhimurium ΔwbaP genetic background. The *wcaA* gene is part of the CA *cps* cluster and encodes a predicted glycosyltransferase involved in CA synthesis, which presumably extends the repeating CA unit. The resulting strain was examined for CA production in the presence

FIG 9 Effects of WcaJ and PssY on O-antigen production in S. Typhimurium LT2. LPS samples were prepared from bacteria grown in 0.2% arabinose and separated by SDS-PAGE as described in Materials and Methods. Polymeric OAg, region of the gel that contains lipid A-core OS bands covalently linked to O-antigen polysaccharides of various lengths; core + 1 OAg, band corresponding to lipid A-core OS with one covalently attached O-antigen subunit. Lanes: 1, S. Typhimurium LT2/pBAD24 (control); 2, S. Typhimurium LT2/ pXF1 encoding WcaJ; 3, S. Typhimurium LT2/pPssY encoding FLAG-PssY; 4, S. Typhimurium LT2/pWQ499 encoding RcsA.

tected fucose but not the O-antigen sugars, and the O-antigen-like bands visualized by silver nitrate lost reactivity to the group B antiserum (Fig. 8B). We interpreted these bands as partial CA units covalently linked to lipid A-core OS. CA is synthesized and exported to the bacterial surface by a dedicated export system that involves several envelope proteins (55). We reasoned that in the absence of a functional WcaA protein, Und-P-P-linked incomplete CA units would not be exported and would instead compete with Und-P-P-linked O antigen for attachment to the lipid A-core OS. In this scenario, the weak Gal-1-P activity of WcaJ or PssY would not be sufficient to complement the wbaP deletion and produce detectable O-antigen molecules. This notion was further supported by an experiment showing that overexpression of WcaJ or PssY in wild-type S. enterica LT2 resulted in altered O-antigen profiles consistent with a reduction of O antigen (Fig. 9, lanes 2 and 3). In contrast, overexpression of RcsA, which stimulates the production of copious amounts of CA (data not shown), did not affect O-antigen production (Fig. 9, lane 4).

DISCUSSION

The biosynthesis of CA and the functional assignment of the genes in the cps gene cluster have not been established. WcaJ was the only candidate protein encoded by this cluster that had features of an initiating enzyme belonging to the PHPT family. The deletion of $wcaJ$ in E. coli K-12 provided us with a bioassay to test proteins with possible UDP-Glc:Und-P Glc-1-P transferase activity. Here we show that in the presence of RcsA (a positive regulator of cps gene transcription), WcaJ and its C. crescentus WcaJ homolog, PssY, reconstituted CA synthesis in the $wcaJ$ deletion mutant, as indicated by the mucoid colony phenotype. Both proteins also showed Glc-1-P transferase activity in vitro. Since PssY shares high sequence similarity to the C-terminal region of WcaJ, we concluded that similar to the case of WbaP (31, 32), the C-terminal region of WcaJ is sufficient for enzymatic activity.

Expression of WcaJ in the C. crescentus $\Delta hfsE \Delta pssY \Delta pssZ$ mutant restored holdfast production. The tagged FLAG-WcaJ protein was also functional, as were FLAG-PssY and FLAG-PssZ, but we did not see holdfast production upon expression of FLAG-HfsE. This was unexpected, since the activity of the protein should reside in the C-terminal domain. We were able to detect expression of FLAG-HfsE; however, it is possible that the FLAG epitope may interfere with either folding or proper localization of the protein.

We observed that in the S. enterica $\Delta wbaP$ mutant, both WcaJ and PssY mediated the synthesis of lipid A-core OS-linked polysaccharides that were initially detected as silver-stained bands. The production of lipid A-core OS-linked O antigen in $\Delta wbaP$ bacteria overexpressing WcaJ and PssY was confirmed by GC-MS analysis of the sugars derived from LPS and by immunoblotting with Salmonella group B antiserum, suggesting that both enzymes possess a low level of Gal-1-P transferase activity in vivo. The LPS samples of S. enterica $\Delta wbaP$ bacteria overexpressing WcaJ or PssY also contained the unique CA sugar fucose, suggesting that these cells produced a mixture of O antigen and $CA_{LPS}$. The $\Delta wbaP$ cells overexpressing RcsA also produced LPS with a similar banding pattern to that of LPS produced in the presence of WcaJ or PssY. However, reactivity with group B antiserum, which detects the specific O antigen produced by S. Typhimurium (Fig. 1), was observed only upon WcaJ and PssY overexpression, not by overexpressing RcsA. We interpreted the O-antigen-like material produced in the presence of RcsA, which lacked reactivity with the O-antigen-specific antiserum, as $CA_{LPS}$. It is conceivable that RcsA-mediated upregulation of the cps gene cluster would lead to increased production of Und-P-P-linked CA subunits, resulting in CA molecules attached to lipid A-core OS. The modification of lipid A-core OS with CA is not unique to Salmonella. $CA_{LPS}$ in E. coli has also been demonstrated upon overexpression of CA with the amino acid analog $p$-fluorophenylalanine (26), as well as in mutants with defects in the LPS export pathway (42).

Two additional observations support this model. First, overexpression of WcaJ and PssY in an S. Typhimurium strain with double deletion of $wbaP$ and $wcaA$ resulted in the production of O-antigen-like bands that did not react with the O-antigen-specific antibody. Since WcaA is a glycosyltransferase required to form a complete CA unit, we propose that in the absence of this protein, a complete CA polysaccharide is no longer produced and exported. This would result in the formation of partial CA units that are ligated to lipid A-core OS and most likely outcompete the small amount of O antigen produced as a consequence of the low Gal-1-P activity of WcaJ and PssY. Since GC-MS showed that this mutant still contained LPS with fucose, we concluded that the deletion of $wcaA$ prevented the incorporation of distal CA sugars (Fig. 1), but WcaA's exact function remains to be determined. Second, overexpression of WcaJ and PssY in the parental S. Typhimurium strain caused changes in O-antigen banding which were not detected with overexpression of RcsA.

The low level of Gal-1-P transferase activity observed for WcaJ and PssY in vivo could not be detected in our in vitro assay with UDP-$[^{14}C]$Gal, and it is possible that the in vitro assay may not be sensitive enough to capture low levels of labeled Und-P-P-Gal product. Supporting this suggestion, site-directed WbaP-CT mutants that have in vivo activity lack in vitro activity under similar

assay conditions (32). Therefore, the *in vivo* studies with genetically defined mutants have provided additional insight into the function of these proteins. In classical glycosyltransferases for which there is structural information available, such as bovine β-1,4-galactosyltransferase, the differentiation between UDP-Gal and UDP-Glc depends on steric clashes between one glutamic acid residue and the C-4 hydroxyl group of Glc (36), while in other glycosyltransferases mutation of one residue can allow for relaxed specificity (14, 30). The UDP-sugar acceptor-binding site in PHPT proteins is unknown, but our results in this study suggest that PssY and WcaJ may be able to accommodate UDP-Gal, albeit less efficiently, in their putative acceptor-binding sites. The reciprocal relaxed specificity was not observed for WbaP, which could not restore CA production upon overexpression in the *E. coli ΔwcaJ* mutant. Current studies are under way in our laboratory to understand the basis for the differences in these proteins and to map residues conferring UDP-sugar specificity.

The absence of *in vivo* and *in vitro* Glc-1-P transferase activity of HfsE and PssZ was puzzling, since PssY, HfsE, and PssZ are functionally redundant (46). The inability of HfsE and PssZ to restore CA synthesis in *E. coli* was not due to a lack of protein expression, as sufficient HfsE was detected as a FLAG-tagged protein, and the N-terminal 6×His-TrxA-PssZ fusion protein was also produced in large amounts. The inability of FLAG-tagged HfsE to restore holdfast production in the *C. crescentus ΔpssY ΔpssZ* mutant led us to test an untagged HfsE protein for glucose-1-phosphate transferase activity in XBF1 (*RcsA*⁺); however, the colonies were nonmucoid and HfsE could not restore CA production. Other alternatives for the lack of HfsE and PssZ UDP-Glc:Und-P Glc-1-P transferase activity are under investigation and include protein instability in *E. coli* and *S. enterica*, misfolding upon overexpression, posttranslational modifications in *C. crescentus* that are required for enzymatic activity, and a requirement of a different nucleotide diphosphate substrate. We also tested the possibility that HfsE and PssZ utilize another UDP-sugar, which would result in different initiating sugars in holdfast polysaccharides. HfsE and PssZ were tested for the ability to complement O-antigen synthesis by utilization of UDP-GlcNAc and UDP-GalNAc in MV501 and MV501/Gne, respectively; however, we could not detect O antigen in cells expressing these proteins.

In summary, we have demonstrated the UDP-Glc:Und-P Glc-1-P transferase activity of *E. coli* K-12 WcaJ and *C. crescentus* PssY and shown that WcaJ is the initiating enzyme for CA synthesis. We also found that when WcaJ or PssY is overexpressed in a mutant of *S.* Typhimurium devoid of the O antigen initiating the Gal-1-P transferase WbaP, the protein has a low level of specificity for UDP-Gal, resulting in production of a mixture of O antigen and CA covalently linked to lipid A-core OS molecules.
