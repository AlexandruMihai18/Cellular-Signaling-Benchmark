Abstract

BACKGROUND: The intricate regulation of several signaling pathways is essential for embryonic development and adult tissue homeostasis. Cancers commonly display aberrant activity within these pathways. A population of cells identified in several cancers, termed cancer stem cells (CSCs) show similar properties to normal stem cells and evidence suggests that altered developmental signaling pathways play an important role in maintaining CSCs and thereby the tumor itself.

SCOPE OF REVIEW: This review will focus on the roles of the Notch, Wnt and Hedgehog pathways in brain, breast and colon cancers. We describe the roles these pathways play in normal tissue homeostasis through the regulation of stem cell fate in these three tissues, and the experimental evidence indicating that the role of these pathways in cancers of these is directly linked to CSCs.

MAJOR CONCLUSIONS: A large body of evidence is accumulating to indicate that the deregulation of Notch, Wnt and Hedgehog pathways play important roles in both normal and cancer stem cells. We are only beginning to understand how these pathways interact, how they are coordinated during normal development and adult tissue homeostasis, and how they are deregulated during cancer. However, it is becoming increasingly clear that if we are to target CSCs therapeutically, it will likely be necessary to develop combination therapies.

GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: If CSCs are the driving force behind tumor maintenance and growth then understanding the molecular mechanisms regulating CSCs is essential. Such knowledge will contribute to better targeted therapies that could significantly enhance cancer treatments and patient survival.

1. Introduction

Many tissues are composed of cells that are constantly turning over via cell proliferation, differentiation, and death. For normal tissue development and maintenance throughout life, a carefully regulated balance of these processes is required to maintain tissue homeostasis. During development and in adult tissues, cells are produced and localized in a defined spatial-temporal manner where their fate is specified by both internal and external signals. Errors that fail to be repaired can dramatically shift the homeostatic balance leading to the initiation, expansion and progression of an abnormal mass of cells that no longer respond to normal signaling cues (see Review [1]). Understanding the mechanisms of normal tissue development and homeostatic control will therefore provide important clues as to how to rein in the 'uncontrolled behaviour' of cancer cells.

At the time of detection tumors generally display extensive cellular heterogeneity, containing cells that differ morphologically, functionally and molecularly. Two models have been proposed to explain intra-tumoral heterogeneity. The conventional stochastic or clonal evolution model postulates that all cells within a tumor have the potential to give rise to new tumors and that distinct clones adapt and evolve to produce genetically and phenotypically distinct cells. On the other hand, the more recently proposed cancer stem cell model postulates that there exists a subset of tumor cells that display stem cell-like properties, originally discovered in leukemia [2, 3] and reviewed in [4, 5]. These cells are termed cancer stem cells (CSCs), tumor-initiating cells (TICs) or tumor-propagating cells (TPCs). CSCs are defined by their capacity to self-renew, differentiate and initiate tumor growth *in vivo* that recapitulates features of the original tumor. A level of hierarchy is maintained, and similar to normal stem cells, CSCs give rise to tumor progeny that are more differentiated and do not have the ability to regenerate a tumor. However, the clonal evolution and CSC models are not necessarily mutually exclusive. For instance, it is has been demonstrated in acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) that patient samples contain multiple genetically distinct subclones of cancer-initiating cells [6] indicating that the CSC-containing sub-fractions within tumors undergo clonal evolution. Thus it is likely that tumor
heterogeneity can be explained using concepts from both models. Analysis of the genetic landscape of tumors, and more specifically the genetics of the CSC population within and across tumors, is currently an area of intensive investigation.

A CSC population was first identified in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) where a subset of cancer cells showed serial transplantation ability [3]. CSCs from solid tumors were more recently identified first from breast cancers [7] and then from several others including brain [8], colon [9-11] head and neck [12], pancreatic [13, 14], melanoma [15], mesenchymal [16], hepatic [17], lung [18], prostate [19] and ovarian [20] cancers. However, not all cancers adhere to the hierarchical model [21-23] and there has been considerable debate about the accuracy of the CSC hypothesis, particularly in studies using human solid tumors and potentially inaccurate xenograft transplantation assays [24]. More recently, studies in mouse models of cancer have provided convincing evidence to support the CSC hypothesis in several cancer types. In these studies, lineage-tracing was used to demonstrate that in the intestine, brain, and skin specific cell subsets marked by stem cell-specific expression of fluorescent proteins act as cancer stem cells, clonally giving rise to malignancies and producing non-malignant, differentiated progeny as well as, in one case, being resistant to chemotherapy [25-27]

In studies of human cancers, CSCs are typically identified and isolated based on biochemical properties such as Hoechst dye efflux or aldehyde dehydrogenase-1 (ALDH1) activity, or by specific cell surface marker expression. In some cancers, such as AML, robust markers have been identified, whereas markers for CSCs in several solid tumors still require further refinement in order to be applied to cancer treatment. Typically, candidate CSC markers are validated using in vivo limiting dilution assays (LDAs) to determine the frequency of cancer cells capable of initiating tumor growth. Bulk tumor or tumor cell fractions isolated by cell-sorting techniques are injected into immunocompromised mice at limiting doses and the frequency at which each population of cells initiates tumor growth is calculated. Cell surface or biochemical markers that successfully enrich for a CSC population will give rise to tumors at low doses that recapitulate the original tumor. CSCs, but not non-CSCs, can be serially
isolated and propagated for several generations of mice. Moreover, in vitro sphere-formation assays have been increasingly utilized to isolate and study CSCs, however, they should be used to complement rather than replace the gold standard of in vivo LDA experiments

Since CSCs possess properties similar to normal stem cells, it has been suggested that the initiating event for cancers occurs in the long-lived normal stem cell compartment [2]. In tissues with high turnover rates, such as blood, skin, and intestinal epithelium, the stem cells may be the only cells sufficiently long-lived to sustain the multiple oncogenic hits that ultimately lead to transformation.

However, alternative mechanisms have been proposed in which more differentiated cells may become CSCs. In this case, an early oncogenic event would be required to activate a stem cell-like program that would allow for survival and self-renewal abilities. Indeed, fully differentiated cells such as fibroblasts can be ‘de-differentiated’ or ‘reprogrammed’ when stem cell genes (Oct4, Sox2, Klf4 and c-Myc) are over-expressed [28]. This finding supports the notion that any cell along a lineage restricting path from a stem cell to a differentiated cell could be a target if the right genetic programs become activated.

Moreover, a block in differentiation events may also result in a prolonged lifespan of these normally short-lived differentiated cells that could favor later transforming events. One example of this is differentiation-inducing transcription factor CCAAT enhancer binding protein alpha (C/EBPα), a critical regulator of tissue-specific gene expression and proliferation arrest [29]. Loss of function of C/EBPα occurs in acute leukemias, and has also been implicated in non-small cell lung cancer, and squamous cell carcinomas of the skin and head and neck [29]. Alternatively, pre-disposing “hits” may occur in the stem cell compartment, with the final transforming event occurring in a more differentiated downstream cell. For example, in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), the initial event (BCR-ABL fusion) occurs in the hematopoietic stem cell compartment, but upon transition from chronic phase to blast crisis, an additional event (activation of Wnt signaling) occurs in the granulocyte-macrophage progenitor, which then acquires self-renewal ability and takes on the role of CSC in this disease [30]. Regardless of the cell of origin, the CSCs that are isolated from tumors display self-renewal properties at both the molecular

and functional level. CSCs express self-renewing genes and exhibit activation of the developmental signaling pathways that are essential in regulating stem cell activity. Heterogeneity among and between different cancers presents challenges to specifically defining CSCs genetically, molecularly, phenotypically, and functionally. Clearly, CSCs are able to self-renew and initiate tumor growth; however, the sequence of events by which a CSC acquired these features, as well as how they maintain these features, is likely very different among tumors. For instance, some CSCs may be more dependent on the Wnt signaling pathway compared to others that may utilize the Hedgehog pathway. Understanding the underpinnings of what defines a CSC population within a specific tumor of interest is essential if CSCs are to be targeted for therapies. In the following sections, it will become evident that despite the shared property of self-renewal, CSCs do NOT necessarily share the same mechanisms of self-renewal and this represents a great challenge for being able to target specific pathways. Signaling pathways that have been discovered to play a role will be discussed.

During embryogenesis, a myriad of signaling pathways are involved in the development of distinct tissues. Identified stem cell-related genes include BMI1, OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG, and the self-renewal properties of both embryonic and adult stem cells are regulated by key developmental signaling pathways such as Notch, Wnt, and Hedgehog (Hh). Adult stem cells usually reside in a niche that is under strict control and highly enriched for the activity of these signaling pathways. Interestingly, the genes involved in these signaling pathways are found to be frequently mutated or aberrantly activated in cancers, and it is the deregulation of these pathways has been linked to CSC function and maintenance.

In summary, if CSCs are the driving force behind tumor maintenance and growth, then understanding the molecular mechanisms regulating CSCs is essential. Evidence suggests that CSC function depends on ligand-receptor-mediated signaling pathways. The Notch, Wnt, and Hh signaling pathways (Figure 1) are conserved in regulating normal stem cell activity, and their deregulation is linked to oncogenesis. This review will focus on the role of the Notch, Wnt, and Hh signaling pathways in CSCs from brain, breast, and colon cancers, as these have been the most extensively studied.

2. Developmental Signaling Pathways - Overview

2.1 Notch

The Notch signaling pathway is evolutionarily conserved and plays many roles such as influencing stem cell fate, differentiation and cell cycle progression. Notch signaling can be either inhibitory or inductive which is highly context dependent [31]. For instance, during brain development, Notch serves as a gatekeeper for cell fate where gliogenesis can only occur when Notch signaling specifically represses the neuronal pathway in the progenitor cells. In Drosophila, Notch signaling induces differentiation in the presumptive wing margin and loss of notch prevents wing formation, resulting in a 'notched' appearance [32].

Mammals have four Notch receptors (Notch1, Notch2, Notch3, and Notch4) and five ligands including the delta-like proteins (DLL1, DLL3, DLL4) and Jagged proteins (JAG1 and JAG2) (Figure 1).

The Notch receptors are transmembrane proteins containing an extracellular domain with EGF-like repeats involved in ligand binding and an intracellular domain (ICD). The ligands for the Notch receptor are also transmembrane proteins and thus activation of Notch signaling occurs by direct cell-to-cell contact. Binding of the ligand to the extracellular portion of the Notch receptor triggers two consecutive proteolytic cleavages by ADAM protease (a disintegrin and metalloprotease) and γ-secretase, leading to release of an active intracellular domain (NICD). In the canonical Notch signaling cascade, NICD translocates to the nucleus, binds to the CSL(CBF1/Suppressor of Hairless/LAG1)/RBPJ transcription factor and activates transcription of specific target genes such as the genes from the hairy and enhancer of split-related (HES) family. In the absence of the Notch signal, CSL/RBPJ is bound by co-repressors and transcription is repressed. In the presence of the Notch signal, NICD together with mastermind-like proteins (MAML1, MAML2, or MAML3) displaces the co-repressors and activates gene expression.

Other downstream targets include PI3K, AKT, NF-kB, PPAR, CyclinD1, p21 and p27 [33].

2.2. Wnt

Two pathways have been identified for Wnt signaling: the canonical pathway where Wnt signaling occurs through β-catenin and is involved in cell fate determination and the non-canonical pathway where Wnt signaling, via a β-catenin independent pathway, is involved in cell movement and polarity. While the latter has been shown to be important in embryogenesis, little is known about its role in cancer stem cell biology and, in the interests of space, it will not be further discussed here. In the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, Wnt ligands bind their receptor complex, Frizzled and LRP5/6 (member of the LDL receptor family) which signals stabilization of β-catenin (Figure 1). In the absence of the Wnt signal, β-catenin is bound by the scaffolding proteins APC (adenomatous polyposis coli) and Axin creating a ‘destruction’ complex. Within this complex β-catenin is sequentially phosphorylated at conserved serine and threonine residues by CK1 and GSK3β. This signals the recruitment of β-TrCP-containing E3 ubiquitin ligase which targets β-catenin for proteasomal degradation. In the presence of the Wnt signal Dishevelled (DSH) inhibits GSK3β activity which prevents the targeted degradation of β-catenin and as a consequence it accumulates in the cell and eventually localizes to the nucleus in a concentration dependent manner. β-catenin then interacts with T-cell factor/lymphoid-enhancer factor (TCF/LEF) to activate transcription. Target genes include CCND1 and MYC [34].

2.3 Hedgehog signaling

The Hh pathway was initially discovered in Drosophila as a mediator of segmental patterning during embryonic development. Sonic Hh (Shh) regulates proliferation, migration, and differentiation and as a morphogen executes these functions spatially and temporally in a gradient-dependent fashion [35]. The Hh pathway plays an essential role in the development of skin, hair follicles and sebaceous glands [36] as well as postnatal and adult brain development [37].

Components of the mammalian Hh pathway include the ligands Sonic (SHH), Desert (DHH) and Indian (IHH) Hh, the membrane receptor Patched (PTCH1/2), the G protein coupled receptor and signal

transducer Smoothened (SMO), and the downstream mediators of gene expression, the GLI zinc finger
transcription factors (GLI1, GLI2 and GLI3) (Figure 1). GLIs act as repressors in the absence of Hh
signaling. In the absence of the ligand, PTCH1 represses SMO and prevents GLI modulation. Binding of
the ligand to PTCH1 releases its repression of SMO and induces the expression and posttranslational
modification of GLI proteins. GLI1 then acts as an activator, GLI2 acts as either an activator or
repressor and GLI3 acts as a repressor. Therefore, the consequences of Hh signaling and the regulation
of its target genes depend on the balanced or net effect of all the GLI factors. Several other factors are
also involved in the correct modulation of this signaling cascade [38].

3. Developmental Signaling Pathways in Stem Cells and Cancer Stem Cells

3.1 Brain

3.1.1 Isolation of normal neural stem cells

Neural stem cells (NSCs) are located in the subventricular zone (SVZ), the hippocampus and the
subgranule zone (SGZ) of the adult brain [39-41]. They were initially isolated from mice using an in
vitro assay in which they could form single cell-derived “neurospheres” that functionally engrafted into
mouse brains and had the potential to differentiate into all three brain lineages (astrocyte,
oligodendrocyte and neuron) [42, 43]. In serum-free conditions normal NSCs display activation of
developmental pathways including Notch and Hh [37, 44, 45].

CD133 (Prominin-1) was identified as a cell surface marker that enriches for murine neural
stem/progenitor cells and is co-expressed with known NSC markers including Sox1, Sox2, Musashi and
Nestin [45]. CD15 (LeX or SSEA1) was also identified as a cell surface marker that enriched for murine
neural stem and progenitor cells from different central nervous system (CNS) regions and its expression
is strong in neural regions with prolonged neurogenesis, such as the olfactory epithelium, hippocampus,
basal forebrain and cerebellum [46]. CD133⁺ cells isolated from human fetal brain showed marked stem
cell activity as demonstrated by the ability to form neurospheres and engraft into brains of

immunodeficient neonatal mice, and the capacity for multilineage differentiation [47, 48]. The cell

surface phenotype CD15+/CD29hi/CD24low was found to mark neural stem cells derived from human

embryonic stem cells [49].

### 3.1.2 Isolation of brain cancer stem cells

CSCs have been identified in various subtypes of brain cancer. This review will focus on

medulloblastoma (MB) and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), as these are the most common and the

most well studied. MBs and gliomas are the most common brain tumors among children and adults,

respectively. MBs are grade IV primary brain tumors that arise in the cerebellum of children and young

adults [50]. Sporadic MBs have genetic aberrations such as CDKN2A deletion, MYC and PDGFRA

amplification, and p53 mutations. Recent re-classification of MBs based on genetic and molecular

parameters yielded five distinct subtypes (Subgroups A-E) [51]. Subgroup A is characterized by the

up-regulation of Wnt-related genes and subgroup B is characterized by the up-regulation of the Hh

pathway, both of which are associated with better overall clinical outcomes compared to groups C-E.

Gliomas are brain tumors with a glial phenotype (astrocytic or oligodendroglial) that arise in the

cerebrum of adult patients. The most common glioma is the grade IV tumor GBM [50]. Alterations in

the components of the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) - RAS-phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI3K)

pathway are detected in 88% of GBMs. Deletion of the CDKN2A/CDKN2B locus results in deregulation

of the RB pathway in 78% of gliomas and alterations in p53 signaling were detected in 87% of gliomas

[52]. Genomic abnormalities were catalogued for GBMs and gene-expression based molecular

classification was used to subdivide GBMs into four subtypes [53].

CSCs from brain tumors were among the first CSCs isolated from a solid tumor. A subset of

brain tumor cells (from both MB and GBM) formed spheres and demonstrated properties of self-renewal,

proliferation and differentiation in a non-adherent in vitro assay [54-57]. MB and GBM CSCs express

markers similar to normal NSCs such as Nestin, CD133, SOX2, Musashi1, and BMI1 [55, 56]. Also

consistent with normal stem cells, CSCs were found to be enriched in the CD133+ cell fraction. CD133+

cells made up a minority of the tumors (0.3 to 25%), and unlike the CD133+ fraction, they were capable
of forming neurospheres and could be maintained in culture through serial passages. The ability of these
CD133+ cells to functionally behave as tumor initiating cells was demonstrated by their ability to form
tumors in the brains of NOD/SCID mice [8]. While CD133+ cells gave rise to both CD133+ and CD133-
cells in the newly formed tumors that resembled the original tumor, CD133- cells did not initiate tumor
growth. In addition, CD15+ cells were also identified as CSCs from mouse MBs [58, 59] and brain CSCs
demonstrate resistance to radiotherapy via activation of the DNA damage response [57].
More recently other studies have found that CD133+ cells from brain cancers were in fact capable of
forming tumors [60]. Similarly, in ovarian cancer, CD133+ cells enriched for TIC activity in the
majority of solid tumor samples, but in some samples, particularly ascites, tumor-initiating activity was
also present in the CD133-fraction [61]. Thus while in vivo injections at limiting dilutions of bulk tumor
cells clearly indicate a subset of cells with tumor-initiating capacity, the aim to phenotypically identify
and prospectively isolate these cells proves to be very difficult due to the heterogeneous nature of
cancers at multiple levels. CD133 may be a very good marker that enriches for one subtype/subclass of
ovarian or brain tumors, while falling short in another subtype. In such cases there may exist other
markers that better phenotypically define CSCs. This is further complicated by the fact that CSCs are by
no means static, but rather are evolving throughout disease progression. Nevertheless, their ability to
self-renew remains a key property that contributes the continued ability of CSCs to drive tumor growth.
3.1.3 Developmental signaling pathways in normal neural stem cells and brain CSCs
3.1.3.1. Notch
In Drosophila, Notch/RBPJ signaling is highly active in neural stem cells [62] and homozygous
loss-of function notch mutants display an expansion of neurons [63]. In vertebrates, Notch signaling
functions to prevent NSCs from entering the neuron lineage whereby suppression of neuron
development promotes gliogenesis. Mechanistically, Notch signaling induces the expression of HES
proteins that bind to and repress expression of neuron-specific genes.

In mice, Notch 2 expression is detected in granule neuron precursor (GNP) cells of the cerebellar cortex in the external granule layer (EGL). Over-expression or activated expression of the components of the Notch pathway in GNP sup-regulates the expression of the Notch target gene Hes1, inhibits differentiation and maintains precursor proliferation [64]. On the other hand, loss of Notch signaling in mouse embryonic brain resulted in the depletion of neural stem cells, loss of Sox2 expression and complete loss of neurogenesis [62, 65]. Thus, Notch signaling is required for the maintenance of neural stem cells and proper neurogenesis in both embryonic and adult brains (Figure 2A). Notch is also required for the in vitro maintenance of neural progenitors where Notch activity promotes survival of neural stem cells and induces the expression of HES3 and SHH through activation of AKT, STAT3 and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) [66].

Components of the Notch signaling pathway are up-regulated in brain cancers and several studies have implicated an important role for Notch signaling in the self-renewal and maintenance of CSCs (Figure 2A). Notch1 and its ligands DLL1 and JAG1 are over-expressed in primary gliomas and cell lines and are associated with high grade gliomas and MBs [67-69]. In MBs, up-regulated levels of Notch2 and its downstream targets were detected and associated with poor survival [68]. Notch2 and Hes5 were also up-regulated in a mouse MB model and inhibition of Notch signaling resulted in decreased cell viability in vitro, decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis in vivo [69].

Furthermore, Fan et al showed that Notch inhibition in MB cells induced differentiation and showed a reduction in CD133+ cell frequency and HES1 expression [70].

Notch expression in K-RAS-induced mouse glioblastomas generated proliferative lesions in the NSC-rich subependymal zone and ultimately led to glioma formation [71]. In human glioma cell lines, down-regulation of Notch signaling components increased apoptosis and decreased cell proliferation [67], whereas activation of Notch increased the formation of neurosphere colonies [72]. Notch (and SHH) components were found to be up-regulated in the CD133+ fraction [73] and Notch inhibition in cultured glioma CSCs inhibited their proliferation in vitro [74]. Down-regulation of Notch components

also sensitized CSCs to radiation or chemotherapeutic treatments and impaired xenograft tumor

formation [74, 75]. In vitro, treatment of normal neural stem cells and glioma stem cells with a

γ-secretase inhibitor resulted in a decrease in neurosphere formation in both, suggesting self-renewal

and proliferation are regulated by Notch activity in both normal and cancer stem cells. Also, similar to

normal NSCs, glioma CSCs showed increased differentiation into neuronal lineages [76]. Finally,

maintenance of brain tumors and CSCs appears to be highly dependent on a perivascular niche which is

thought to regulate Notch activity in CSCs [77].

3.1.3.2. Wnt

Wnt signaling is an important regulator of stem cell self-renewal in the developing brain [78].

Using the Axin2-LacZ Wnt reporter mouse, Wnt-responsive cells were identified in the SVZ of the

developing E14.5 mouse brain (Figure 2B). The LacZ+ fraction was enriched for sphere-forming cells

that were capable of differentiating into neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. Treatment with Wnt

inhibitor Dkk reduced secondary sphere formation, demonstrating that Wnt signaling is required for the

efficient cloning and expansion of neural stem cells in primary culture.

Patients with Turcot's syndrome contain mutations in the APC gene and show a higher incidence

of brain tumors (more commonly MBs) and colorectal cancers [79]. Sporadic MBs (~13%) also contain

mutations in components of the Wnt signaling pathway (Figure 2B), including Axin, β-catenin, and APC

[80-83]. MBs showing deregulation in Wnt signaling have been subcategorized into their own group

(Group A) accounting for 20% of MBs, and have a relatively good prognosis [51]. The reason for good

vs. poor prognoses in different subtypes of MB is not known, but may be related to different cells of

origin, or to the specific signaling networks that drive tumor growth and their role in processes such as

mediation of therapy resistance and/or metastasis. Interestingly, a mouse model for Wnt-mediated MB

suggests that tumors of this subgroup arise from cells outside the cerebellum in the dorsal brainstem [84,

85]. Altogether, Wnt regulates self-renewal in normal stem cells and is deregulated in a group of patients

with brain tumors. However, the role of Wnt in brain CSCs has not been extensively studied.

The Shh pathway is well known for its role in brain growth and patterning during development [86] and has been implicated in neural stem cell maintenance (Figure 2C) [87]. Positional specification has been previously shown to play an important role in determining the neuronal cell type that is generated from NSCs in the SVZ [88]. The positional mechanism is not well understood, however recent studies have shown that Shh signaling is associated and required for the specification and production of olfactory interneurons [89]. In addition, Hh signaling regulates the proliferation of the GNPs in the EGL of the developing cerebellum.

The identification of a role for the Hh signaling pathway in MB arose from the discovery that patients with Gorlin syndrome have inactivating *PTCH1* mutations, and have a higher predisposition for developing MBs and skin basal cell carcinomas [90]. In mouse models, mutations in *Ptch1* resulted in the development of MBs [91]. Furthermore, many sporadic human MBs contain mutations in the Hh pathway (Figure 2C). Loss of function mutations of *PTCH1* lead to uninhibited Hh signaling, resulting in extensive proliferation. It is thought that the Hh pathway-driven subtype of MB arises in the GNPs, whereas the “classic” MBs arise in the ventricular zone of the fourth ventricle [85].

Although the involvement of Shh is better characterized in MBs, there are some findings implicating Hh signaling in GBM tumorigenesis as well [81], particularly in glioma CSC regulation [92, 93]. Hh-GLI signaling was shown to regulate the expression of stemness genes (*NANOG*, *OCT4*, *SOX2*, and *BMI1*) and to be required for self-renewal of CD133+ glioma CSCs [92]. Cyclopamine, an inhibitor of Hh signaling, decreased self-renewal of glioma CSCs, induced apoptosis and also rendered cells more sensitive to temozolomide (TMZ).

Bar et al [93] found that GLI1 was highly expressed in 26% of primary GBMs and 57% of cell lines, and SHH was expressed in some primary tumors and GBM-derived tumorspheres. Inhibition with cyclopamine or GLI1 shRNA resulted in a significant decrease in glioma growth in vitro and decreased primary and secondary sphere formation, suggesting that CSCs were depleted. ALDH1 activity and dye

exclusion, which are associated with stem-like phenotypes, also decreased with cyclopamine treatment.

In agreement with [57], who showed that CD133⁺ GBM stem-like cells are resistant to radiation therapy, Clement et al [92] showed that combining cyclopamine with radiation treatment resulted in a decrease in growth rate in vitro.

### 3.2. Breast

#### 3.2.1 Isolation of normal mammary stem cells

The mammary tissue is organized in a hierarchical manner (Figure 3). Mammary stem cells (MaSCs) maintain tissue homeostasis and give rise to luminal and myoepithelial cells through a series of lineage restricting events. Several studies in mouse models have expanded our knowledge of the mammary epithelial hierarchy, and shed light on essential signals that when altered perturb normal growth and trigger the onset of cancer. MaSCs are studied using the 'gold standard' in vivo mammary reconstitution assay [94] in which epithelial cells are cleared from the mammary fat pad and exogenous cells are implanted that successfully regenerate fully functional mammary epithelial outgrowths [95-97]. The repopulating cells responsible for the outgrowths are capable of serial transplantation, demonstrating their self-renewal properties. Mouse MaSCs are enriched in the CD49fhiCD29hiCD24+Sca1⁻ population and demonstrate multi-lineage differentiation and self-renewal capabilities [22, 98, 99]. More importantly, a single MaSC that was genetically tagged was demonstrated to be sufficient to regenerate an entire mammary epithelial organ [100].

In vitro culturing of human mammary epithelial cells as non-adherent “mammospheres” enriches for early progenitor/stem cells [101]. Cells derived from mammospheres can differentiate along the mammary epithelial lineages and clonally generate functional mammary structures in vitro [101, 102]. Furthermore, CD49f⁺EpCAM⁻/low cells isolated from human breast tissue showed in vivo regeneration [103]. The outgrowths displayed human mammary architecture, albeit at lower frequencies, likely owing to the lack of complete humanization. Injection under the renal capsule, which is highly vascularized, has also been utilized to study human MaSCs [103].

3.2.2 Isolation of breast cancer stem cells

Breast cancers display a high degree of heterogeneity at both histological and molecular levels.

Before describing the isolation of breast CSCs, it is important to mention the subtypes of breast cancers.

Gene expression profiles and hormone receptor status (estrogen (ER), progesterone (PR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)) have been used to describe the following distinct subtypes (percent of total breast cancers): Luminal A (~40-60%) [(ER+ and/or PR+, HER2-, low Ki67)], Luminal B (~6-20%) [(ER+ and/or PR+, HER2+ (or HER2 with high Ki67)], HER2+ (7-12%) [(HER2+, ER-, PR-)], and Triple negative/basal-like (~15-20%) [(ER-, PR-, HER2-, cytokeratin 5/6+, and/or HER1+)] [104].

The different subtypes are thought to arise from different mutation profiles or different cells of origin [105]. Basal-like tumors over-express several stem cell genes, are highly heterogeneous and very aggressive, with poor overall survival.

Al-Hajj et al [7] was the first group to isolate CSCs from human breast cancers, more specifically from metastatic pleural effusions. Breast CSCs were enriched in the minority fraction of Lineage-CD44+CD24low cells, with as few as 100 CD44+CD24low cells able to initiate tumor growth in immunocompromised mice. The resulting tumors displayed a mixture of cells similar to the original tumor and only the CD44+CD24low fractions could be serially passaged. Subsequent studies also reported successful isolation of breast CSCs using this phenotype [106, 107]. Epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) was found to further enrich the CD44+CD24low fraction for CSCs [7] and ALDH1 could also enrich for breast CSCs [108]. Breast CSCs have also been successfully cultured in vitro.

Similar to normal MaSCs, breast cancer cells form mammospheres that display properties of self-renewal, differentiate into multiple mammary epithelial lineages and have the CD44+CD24low CSC phenotype [109]. It is important to note that the CD44+CD24low CSC phenotype was established using only 9 samples that were metastatic breast cancer samples which are not representative of all breast cancers. The CD44+CD24low CSC phenotype needs to be functionally validated across a larger number of breast cancer samples and also whether CD44+CD24low fraction defines CSCs among the distinct

ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT

subtypes of breast cancer needs to be further investigated.

Immunohistochemical analysis of the CD44⁺CD24-low phenotype has been performed on patient breast cancers in order to examine the relationship of the CSC population to different subtypes and/or to patient outcomes. In one study, the CD44⁺CD24-low phenotype was observed in only 31% of breast cancers and was more commonly detected in the basal-like subgroup and BRCA1-hereditary tumors [110]. Moreover, 35% of tumors did not show any expression of CD44 and CD24. Several additional studies have examined the CSC marker profile (CD44/CD24/ALDH) immunohistochemically across varying patient cohorts [111]. Since these include a wide range of samples (i.e. invasive, lymph node negative vs. positive, recurrent vs. non-recurrent, etc.) it is very challenging to get a clear picture of how CSCs relate to each subtype and/or different stages of progression and/or different clinical outcomes.

However, it does seem evident that the CD44⁺CD24-low and the ALDH1⁺ phenotypes correlate strongly with basal-like breast tumors [110]. In terms of prognostic value, studies demonstrate that tumors with higher CD44⁺CD24-low or ALDH1⁺ are associated with more aggressive phenotypes and tend to have poor prognosis [109]. However, interestingly, when studying primary invasive carcinomas, patients with tumors with a CD44⁺CD24-low phenotype had a better prognosis than those with the CD44⁺CD24⁺ phenotype [117]. When examining the expression of ALDH1 and CD44⁺CD24-low CSC markers in a large cohort of breast cancers, Tsang et al found that the expression of CSC markers varied among cancers of different molecular subtypes and with different clinico-pathological features, indicating that CSC populations could have distinct clinical value in different subgroups of breast cancers [115]. Thus considerable work remains to be done to determine the presence of functionally active CSCs in different breast cancer subtypes and to identify corresponding biomarkers.

Moreover, along the lines of examining the genetic diversity among breast cancers and cancer stem cells, the existence of a simple differentiation hierarchy within breast cancers was challenged. Polyak's group examined the cellular and genetic diversity in human breast carcinomas and found a high degree of genetic heterogeneity, both within and between distinct tumor cell populations that were

defined based on markers of cellular phenotypes. In several tumors, stem cell-like (CD44⁺CD24⁻) and more-differentiated (CD44⁺CD24⁺) cancer cell populations were genetically distinct, an observation that is inconsistent with a strictly hierarchical model [112]. This study highlights the importance of examining the role of genetic diversity in intra-tumoral heterogeneity and how it may or may not drive the functional behaviors of different populations of cancer cells.

### 3.2.2 Developmental signaling pathways in normal mammary stem cells and breast CSCs

#### 3.2.2.1 Notch

The Notch signaling pathway plays an important role in normal mammary development through the regulation of cell fate, proliferation, and stem cell self-renewal [113]. Induction of Notch activity in an in vitro mammosphere assay resulted in stem cell expansion, showing a 10-fold increase in secondary mammosphere formation. Notch also appeared to enhance the commitment and proliferation of myoepithelial lineage-specific cells (Figure 4). However, Notch involvement downstream of this commitment step was not observed. These authors therefore conclude that “Notch signaling acts on both stem cells and progenitors, affecting self-renewal and lineage-specific differentiation”. It was from this study that it was suggested that deregulated Notch signaling may contribute to cancer via deregulation of normal stem cell activity.

Interestingly, in contrast to the findings showing that the Notch pathway is up-regulated in normal stem cells, the expression of the Notch target gene *Heyl* was found to be significantly lower in putative stem cells identified in a Wnt-reporter transgenic mouse (Axin2 promoter-driven *lacZ*) [114].

Such contrasting data may reflect the complexity of Notch signaling and moreover the interplay of pathways governing stem cell fate. Indeed, the expression pattern and function of the Notch paralogs are likely to vary within the normal breast epithelia, and Notch signaling has been implicated in luminal cell-specific differentiation. In line with these results, one study found that the down-regulation of Notch signaling in MaSCs resulted in increased reconstitution [115].

Although differences exist between mouse and human mammary architecture, much insight into breast cancer has been gained through the use of mouse models. A role for Notch in breast cancers was first identified in mouse mammary tumors. Frequent integration of mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) into the Notch4 or Notch1 genes results in truncated intracellular forms of these receptors that are constitutively activated [116, 117]. Activation of Notch4 was sufficient to induce mammary adenocarcinomas, while Notch1 activation was sufficient to transform mouse mammary epithelial cells in vitro and accelerated tumor growth in cooperation with Her2/Neu in vivo, suggesting an oncogenic role for Notch receptors in mammary tumor development [117].

Expression of Notch signaling components is common in human breast cancers, with Notch activation reported to be present in 50% of breast cancers [118]. High JAG1 and NOTCH1 expression is associated with poor survival [119, 120]. Consistently, NOTCH1 and NOTCH4 over-expression was detected in basal-like tumors that also display poor prognosis [121, 122]. Notch1 activity appears to be important for tumor cell growth, as downregulation of NOTCH1 using siRNA in breast cancer cells induced apoptosis, possibly mediated through the inactivation of NF-kB. Furthermore, decreased levels/activity of NOTCH1 also rendered tumors more sensitive to doxorubicin and docetaxel [123]. Notch3 expression in the mammary gland also induces tumorigenesis [124] and Notch3 activity appears to play a role in ErbB2-negative tumors, but not Erb2-positive tumors [125]. Exome sequencing continues to reveal mutations in Notch signaling components within breast cancers [126].

Deregulation of Notch signaling appears to occur early in pre-invasive ductal carcinomas [127]. Higher levels of Notch1-ICD, Notch4-ICD and HES1 were detected in ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) as compared to normal mammary tissue. High Notch1-ICD expression correlated with reduced time to recurrence 5 years post surgery. Mammosphere forming efficiency of DCIS was reduced with Notch inhibition (using the γ-secretase inhibitor DAPT or a Notch4 neutralizing antibody) suggesting Notch activity is important in self-renewal properties of breast cancers.

Inhibition of Notch1 and Notch4 signaling in both primary breast cancer samples and cell lines

resulted in a decreased ability to form mammospheres, a reduced frequency of CD44+/CD24low cells and  
a reduced ability to form tumors in vivo [128]. Inhibition of Notch 4 produced a more robust effect  
suggesting it is implicated in CSC activity. This is consistent with the finding that Notch 4 activity is  
higher in stem cell enriched populations compared to differentiated cells, although a direct effect of  
Notch 4 on stem cell self-renewal activity was not shown. The distinct expression of Notch 1 and Notch 4  
is in agreement with a previous study showing that in normal breast tissue, Notch 1 was expressed  
specifically in luminal cells and Notch 4 in basal stem cells [129]. Expression of Notch 1 and 2 were  
increased during luminal differentiation and JAG1 was highest in the bipotent colony forming  
cell-enriched fraction. It is proposed that Notch 4 activity regulates stem-to-progenitor cell transitions  
and Notch 1 regulates progenitor-to-luminal differentiation. Intriguingly, this data is consistent with the  
results for Notch 1 or Notch 4 activation in mouse models. The single activation of Notch 1 was sufficient  
to transform cells in vitro, but not to generate mammary carcinogenesis in vivo. Conversely, activation  
of Notch 4 inhibits mammary epithelial cell differentiation and is sufficient to generate mammary  
carcinogenesis in mice [130].  

### 3.2.2.2 Wnt

Wnt1 was first identified as a mammary oncogene in mice infected with mouse mammary tumor  
virus (MMTV), which integrated into the Wnt1 gene resulting in its ectopic activation. In this model  
hyperplasias were detected initially and carcinogenesis occurred only after some time, suggesting that  
Wnt plays a role in tumor initiation [131, 132]. Furthermore, expansion of the Lineage-CD29hiCD24+  
mouse MaSC population was detected in these mice [100]. In addition, Wnt-responsive cells were  
identified in adult mammary glands of Axin2-lacZ mice [114] where they were located in the basal layer  
of mammary ducts as previously suggested, and they also expressed the previously reported cell surface  
markers CD24+CD29hi [99, 100]. Selection for lacZ+ cells enriched for stem cells within the  
CD24+CD29hi population as detected by mammary outgrowth experiments and MaSCs were shown to be  
dependent on Wnt for long term expansion and self-renewal. Rather than act as a mitogenic growth
factor, the authors propose that Wnt prevents differentiation of the dividing cells and thereby leads to self-renewal. Consistent with this idea, they found that GATA3, a transcription factor that promotes differentiation into luminal cells, is inhibited by Wnt signaling. Finally, activated β-catenin was also sufficient to induce mammary tumor formation [133].

Wnt signaling mutations and pathway deregulation were subsequently investigated in primary human breast cancers. Unlike colon cancers, which commonly contain mutations within the Wnt signaling cascade, few such mutations have been found in breast cancers. Despite lack of direct gene mutations, up-regulation of Wnt activity has been detected in breast cancers. Lin et al [134] detected high levels of β-catenin expression in 60% of breast cancers, which also correlated with elevated levels of CCND1 (a target of β-catenin/TCF/LEF transcriptional activation) and with poor prognosis. Also observed is a decreased expression of the Wnt inhibitory factor (WIF1) and elevated expression of Wnt ligands themselves [132]. Aberrant methylation of the APC gene promoter has also been detected in breast cancer [135]. Wnt hyperactivity may also be a consequence of other cancer-associated mutations. For instance, other signaling pathways such as FGF and EGF, or GSK3β regulation by IGF1 and AKT kinases, may impinge on β-catenin-mediated signaling. Also, p53 and PTEN negatively regulate β-catenin, and loss of function of these factors is very common in various cancers.

### 3.2.2.3 Hedgehog

Members of the Hh pathway are expressed during all stages of mouse mammary gland development [136-139]. Hh ligands likely have redundant functions, as knock-out mice for each Hh alone (Shh, Ihh or Dhh) demonstrated no difference in mammary gland formation as compared to wild-type control mice. PTCH1 and GLI are expressed in both mammary epithelial cells and in the fibroblasts in the adjacent stroma, and GLI2 exhibits a dynamic expression pattern in the two compartments during pregnancy [139]. *Ptch1* homozygous knock-out mice were lethal; however, heterozygous *Ptch1* mice displayed ductal hyperplasia and dysplasia [140]. Interestingly, *Ptch1* mammary epithelial cells transplanted into the cleared mammary fat pad of wild-type mice gave rise tonormal mammary glands suggesting that the defect in mammary development in *Ptch1* mice was due

to the perturbation of PTCH1 in the stroma. Similarly, dysplasias observed in Gli2 knock-out mice were

not observed when mammary tissue from these mice were transplanted into cleared fat pads of wild-type

mice [139]. These results demonstrate the importance of stromal-epithelial interactions for mammary

gland development and that the Hh signaling pathway plays an essential role in mediating this

interaction.

In addition to its role in stromal-epithelial interactions, Hh signaling also contributes to

mammary intraepithelial activity. *Ptch1* mice showed an expansion of the progenitor (CD24+CD29low)

population [141, 142]. Moreover, components of the Hh pathway are expressed in normal human

mammary progenitor cells and they are up-regulated when cultured as mammospheres and

down-regulated when induced to differentiate [142]. This study also showed that activated Hh signaling,

including over-expression of GLI2, increased mammosphere forming ability and led to ductal

hyperplasia when transplanted into mice. Conversely, inhibition of Hh signaling using cyclopamine

resulted in a decrease in mammosphere forming ability.

Comparative genomic hybridization analysis of human breast cancer samples and cell lines

uncovered a frequent loss in the chromosomal PTCH1 region (19% of samples) and amplification in the

GLI1 region [143]. PTCH1 was also shown to be silenced through promoter methylation [144]. SMO is

expressed at higher levels in DCIS and invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) and constitutive activation of

SMO in mouse mammary glands results in ductal dysplasia [140]. Immunohistological detection of SHH

was higher in breast cancers compared to normal tissue [145]. Moreover, the Hh signaling pathway was

found to be activated in the CSC-enriched CD44+CD24low fraction [142, 146]. The strongest evidence

for Hh involvement in breast carcinogenesis comes from a study in which conditional over-expression of

GLI1 alone in the mouse mammary gland was sufficient to induce tumor formation [147]. Expansion of

mammary progenitor cells was observed and genes involved in proliferation, cell survival and metastasis

were up-regulated. These tumors displayed basal or basal/luminal epithelial phenotypes and

22
up-regulation of genes important for epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Altogether, these results demonstrate that the Hh signaling pathway is essential for self-renewal and proliferation of breast CSCs.

Further studies may clarify the role of Hh in stem cell maintenance, epithelial-stromal interactions and EMT, as well as contributions to the initiation and progression of breast cancer.

### 3.3 Colon

#### 3.3.1 Isolation of normal colon stem cells

Human and mouse intestinal stem cells reside within the basal crypt and give rise to transit amplifying progenitor cells that migrate upward through the crypt and go on to terminally differentiate into enterocytes, goblet cells and endocrine cells. Intestinal stem cells also give rise to the Paneth cells that migrate down to the base of the crypt and are thought to contribute to the stem cell niche. LGR5 (G protein-coupled receptor 5) and BMI1 have been independently shown to mark intestinal stem cells using in vivo lineage tracing experiments, however, their expression pattern is spatially distinct. LGR5+ cells are located at the crypt base and are capable of differentiating into all the intestinal cell types [148]. Single LGR5+ sorted cells can give rise to long term cultures in vitro and remarkably form crypt-like cells that also differentiate into all the cell types. BMI1, essential for hematopoietic and neural stem cell self-renewal, is discretely expressed in the basal crypts of the small intestine of mice and BMI1+ cells are restricted to the “+4” position (putative stem cell position) directly adjacent to the Paneth cells [149]. Consistent with BMI1 specifically marking intestinal stem cells, ablation of BMI1 results in the loss of crypt formation, supporting a functional role for BMI1 in intestinal stem cell self-renewal. The functional distinction between these two candidate intestinal SC populations was recently clarified, with LGR5 marking mitotically active stem cells that contribute to homeostatic regeneration, and BMI1 marking quiescent stem cells that proliferate in response to injury [150].

#### 3.3.2 Isolation of colon cancer stem cells

Colon CSCs are thought to originate in the basal crypt as a result of the transformation of normal stem cells, which then behave in a deregulated fashion giving rise to tumor progeny that move up from

the crypt [148, 151]. Targeted Apc mutations in mouse intestinal LGR5⁺ cells, but not LGR5⁻ cells, resulted in the formation of polyps, suggesting a higher predisposition for cancers to originate from normal stem cells of the colon tissue [148].

Human colon CSCs were first identified within the CD133⁺ population [9, 10]. The CD133⁺ fraction isolated from colon cancers induced tumor formation in vivo and demonstrated self-renewal properties by re-initiating tumor growth over several generations, while the CD133⁻ fraction did not.

Furthermore, CD133⁺ cells formed spheres in vitro that remained in an undifferentiated state and over time still maintained their ability to engraft and reproduce the same histological appearance as the original tumor [9]. Dalerba et al [11] found the tumor initiating population within the EpCAMhi/CD44⁺ fraction as well as within a CD166⁺ sub-fraction. Other studies describing CSC markers in colon cancer include CD44 [152], CD24 [153], ALDH1 [154], as well as MSI1 [155] and CD29 [156].

Since several markers were identified to select for colon CSCs, Vermeulen et al [156] set out to re-examine the expression of these markers. Through the use of single cell sorting, clonogenic potential was found to reside within the CD133⁺ fraction which co-expressed the previously identified colon CSC markers (i.e. CD44, CD166, LGR5, CD29, CD24). CD133⁺ and CD24⁺ cells were enriched in sphere assays and decreased upon differentiation while CD166 and CD29 expression did not change. More intriguing is that CSCs did indeed contain multi-lineage differentiation potential both in vitro and in vivo.

Upon plating from the spheroids or primary cancers, a single cell was able to give rise to differentiated cells of multiple lineages, supporting the hierarchical model in colon cancer.

In contrast to these findings, a study using a knock-in LacZ reporter driven by the endogenous CD133 promoter showed that CD133 gene expression is in fact not restricted to stem cells but is broadly expressed. In the metastatic colon cancer samples that were examined, both LacZ⁺ and LacZ⁻ fractions formed colonospheres in vitro and formed tumors in vivo [157]. CD133 was also shown to be differentially expressed depending on the cell cycle, further questioning its reliability as a cancer stem cell marker [158]. However, it has since been shown that while CD133 mRNA is broadly expressed, it is

differentially folded as a result of differential glycosylation to mask specific epitopes, and the epitope recognized by the commonly used antibody AC133 is differentially expressed in stem cell populations [159].

Colon cancer, like other cancers, shows extensive intra-tumoral heterogeneity. To investigate this at the single cell level, Dalerba et al [160] injected single cells from colon cancer tissues and found that the transcriptional diversity in cancers can be explained by *in vivo* multi-lineage differentiation and does not appear to simply be the result of clonal genetic heterogeneity. They further showed that certain gene expression programs linked to multi-lineage differentiation were strongly associated with patient survival.

### 3.3.3 Developmental signaling pathways in normal intestinal stem cells and colon CSCs

#### 3.3.3.1 Notch

Notch signaling is not well characterized in the colon. Nonetheless, components of the Notch signaling pathway are expressed in crypt areas containing stem cells and transit amplifying cells [161-163]. Fre et al [161] found that Notch activation inhibits differentiation and expands the population of proliferating progenitors. In contrast, Notch inhibition in the intestinal epithelium, by the deletion of Hes1 [164], RBP-J [163], or Notch1 and Notch2 [162] or by pharmacological inhibition with a γ-secretase inhibitor [163], results in loss of transient amplifying cells and goblet cell metaplasia (Figure 5A). Deletion of Jag1 (causing loss of Notch activity) also showed similar effects [165]. Thus Notch appears to have two main roles in the intestine: maintenance of proliferating undifferentiated stem and progenitor cells (to maintain crypts) and directing differentiation to the absorptive (enterocyte) lineage rather than the secretory (goblet and paneth) lineage [166].

Notch ligand/receptor expression in colon cancer is highly complex (Figure 5A). Notch1 or Hes1 activation was observed in *Apc*- mice and also in human colon cancer cell lines and primary tumor samples [167]. Intestinal restricted expression of the activated Notch1-ICD receptor using the villin- promoter in Tcf4-null mice led to an increased frequency of adenomas, suggesting that Wnt and Notch

act in combination [168]. Furthermore, Notch activation occurs via β-catenin-mediated up-regulation of Jagl and is required for tumorigenesis in the intestine [165]. Moreover the proliferative effect of the Notch signal, but not the differentiating effect, was Wnt-dependent [161]. Finally, it is suggested that Notch plays a role in the initiation of colon cancer but not in its progression. Consistent with this notion is the finding that Notch signals are high in early colorectal cancers [169] and appear to be lower in advanced cancers [161].

Notch signaling is activated in human colon CSCs [170]. In a xenograft model of OMP-C9 colon cancer cells, targeted inhibition of the Notch ligand DLL4 using an anti-DLL4 antibody inhibited tumor growth and reduced the expression of HES1, the proliferation of tumor cells, and the CSC frequency as detected by flow cytometry and tumorigenicity [170]. Sikandar et al [171] also found that colon CSCs highly express Notch signaling factors and that Notch is essential for self-renewal and tumor initiation. CSCs showed self-renewing features, as they were maintained for at least six passages and upon single cell culturing in a three-dimensional model they differentiated and displayed glandular organization.

Components of the Notch signaling pathway, including Notch1, HES1 and JAG1, were highly expressed in colon CSCs. High Notch activity was also detected using a reporter assay. Blocking Notch signaling with small molecule inhibitors or shRNAs resulted in the downregulation of HES1 expression and induced cells to differentiate into MUC2+ cells. This is consistent with mouse models showing that HES1 represses both differentiation and p27/CDK1B activity (a growth arrest factor). In summary, Notch signaling was shown to be important for colon CSC survival, proliferation, and subsequent tumor formation.

While EGFR-targeted therapies are effective in treating ~10% of patients with colon cancer, those that contain KRAS oncogenic mutations are insensitive to anti-EGFR therapies. Intriguingly, anti-DLL4 was sufficient to reduce such KRAS-mutant colon tumors [172]. These results demonstrate the potential effectiveness of treating cancers through the targeting of major signaling cascades.

3.3.3.2 Wnt

A gradient of Wnt expression exists within the crypts and villi of the intestine, with elevated expression at the base of the crypt that decreases up toward the villus (Figure 5B). Wnt signaling is required for maintenance of intestinal stem cells located at the base of the crypt [173, 174].

Deregulated Wnt activity appears to be the earliest defect to predispose the colon to carcinogenesis (Figure 5B). Familial adenomatous polyposis is a hereditary cancer involving a defective APC allele which results in numerous colon polyps or adenomas. Loss of APC leads to nuclear β-catenin which signals stem and progenitor cell expansion. These clonal outgrowths of cells can accumulate further mutations that lead to cancer progression. Progression of colon cancer involves dysplasia of normal epithelial cells that develop into adenomatous polyps that further develop into invasive cancers.

A model for colon carcinogenesis suggests this progression occurs with the appearance of the following mutations: adenoma class I (APC mutations), class II (K-RAS activation), class III (DCC mutations), and invasive (p53 mutations) [175]. Interestingly, none of these mutations are required for progression and this is where additional mechanisms need to be discovered [176, 177].

Deregulated Wnt activation is also prominent among sporadic colon cancers. Inactivating mutations in APC are found in up to 80% of sporadic colon cancers and activating mutations of β-catenin are also found, both of which culminate in activated Wnt signaling. Several studies using transgenic mouse models to examine the Wnt pathway, whether by gain of function or loss of function, activation or inactivation, have shown that Wnt signaling promotes stem cell and progenitor proliferation [173, 178, 179].

Studies focusing on the Wnt pathway and its role in colon cancer stem cell function are limited. Nonetheless, Wnt activity has been implicated to play an essential role within the CD133+ population of colorectal cancer. Vermeulen et al [180] showed that with the use of a Wnt reporter construct, high Wnt activity was functionally designated to the colon CSC population. Also, high activity of the Wnt pathway is observed preferentially in tumor cells located close to stromal myofibroblasts, indicating that Wnt activity and cancer stemness may be regulated by extrinsic cues. In agreement with this notion,
myofibroblast-secreted factors, specifically hepatocyte growth factor, activate β-catenin-dependent transcription and subsequently CSC clonogenicity. More significantly, myofibroblast-secreted factors also restore the CSC phenotype in more differentiated tumor cells, both *in vitro* and *in vivo*. The authors propose that stemness of colon cancer cells is in part orchestrated by the microenvironment, indicating much more dynamic properties than previously expected, and can be defined by high Wnt activity.

Evidence for Wnt activity within colon CSCs was also found by Ernst et al [181]. Upon gene expression profiling of CD133⁺ versus CD133⁻ cells from primary patient samples, EGR1 (Early Growth Response Protein 1) showed the highest expression within the CD133⁺ fraction. EGR1 regulates Wnt signaling through the up-regulation of TCF4, which induces the stem cell marker LGR5. Furthermore, de Sousa et al [182] found that gene signatures derived from colorectal CSCs isolated using a Wnt reporter construct correlated with poor prognosis. Surprisingly, in this study methylation of a subset of Wnt target genes was associated with tumor progression. The authors suggest that this may reflect silencing of Wnt targets that act as negative feedback regulators of the pathway and therefore suppression of these genes by methylation might in fact increase Wnt activity levels and contribute to disease progression and relapse via activation of yet unknown positive targets. However, this has yet to be proven, and underscores the importance of understanding the genetic and epigenetic landscape and its relationship to cellular behaviour and function.

### 3.3.3 Hedgehog

During embryonic development of the colon, Shh is expressed at the base of the crypts, and Ihh is expressed throughout the epithelium [183]. Shh and Ihh play distinct roles in villus formation. The villi are projections into the lumen of the colon that contain more mature colon epithelial cell types and the crypts are invaginations in between each villus (also termed intervillus epithelium) containing less differentiated epithelial cells where stem cells reside at the crypt bases. Shh is expressed in the intervillus epithelium and mutant Shh mice show overgrown villi that clog the duodenal lumen, suggesting that Shh restricts villus growth in the duodenum. Ihh-mutant mice display a decrease in villithat are hypoplastic. PTCH1 and GLI1 are expressed in the underlying mesenchyme in the developing intestine and colon of the mouse, suggesting that they are receiving signals from the epithelium

[183-185]. Despite differing roles of Shh and Ihh, the transgene expression of Hhip, a negative regulator of Hh signaling, abrogates villus formation altogether demonstrating an important role for Hh signaling in villus development and growth. Shh signaling also appears to play a role in initial crypt development, restricting precursor cells to the intervillus epithelium. Although not clear, it is thought that the absence of Hh signaling relieves repression of Wnt signaling which thereby induces precursor cells to proliferate. Alternatively, it may be that Hh signaling is required for survival of the cells that have already exited from the cell cycle.

In colon cancers, Hh activation occurs via transcriptional up-regulation of the Hh ligands rather than by mutation [186, 187]. Increased transcript levels of SHH and its downstream target GLI2 are detected in colon cancers compared to normal tissue [188]. Expression of Ihh, which is involved in the differentiation of enterocytes, is lost in early stages of human colorectal carcinogenesis [189]. Apc-/– mice that develop polyps also display down-regulation of Ihh expression.

It is suggested that Hh signaling increases with colon cancer progression [190] and Varnat et al [191] found that Hh signaling components are in fact activated in advanced human colon cancer cells and their CSCs. GLI1 expression was enriched in CD133⁺ cells from patients with advanced/metastatic cancers and a novel ‘red/green’ competition assay showed that active Hh signaling was essential for the survival and expansion of the CD133⁺ cells *in vivo*. This is the first paper to show that Hh signaling is directly linked to CSC self-renewal and tumor growth in advanced colon cancers. That Hh mediators were expressed only in the tumor cells and not surrounding stroma, which is in contrast to the mouse models, indicates the importance of caution when relating mouse findings to human tissues. These authors subsequently showed that Hh signaling increases in parallel to metastasis within the CD133⁺ fraction while Wnt signaling decreases. They suggest that metastatic transition is driven by high GLI1 activity which down-regulates Wnt signaling. Therefore, metastatic colon cancers could potentially be
treated by blocking Hh signaling [191].

4. Concluding Remarks

While there has been much controversy surrounding the CSC hypothesis, it is clear that many tumors are in fact caricatures of the normal tissues in which they arise. This is supported by the similarities in phenotypes between normal stem cells and CSCs, and by the role of deregulation of pathways that are normally essential for embryonic development and maintenance of tissue homeostasis in cancer initiation and progression, as described above. While the Notch, Hh and Wnt pathways clearly play important roles in normal and cancer stem cells, there are a number of additional pathways that likely also contribute to the maintenance of tissue homeostasis, and whose deregulation can lead to cancer. Furthermore, it is clear that these pathways are carefully coordinated during development and there is significant cross-talk between them. Thus we have barely begun to touch the surface of understanding how these pathways interact, how they are coordinated during normal development and adult tissue homeostasis, and how they are deregulated during cancer. However, it is becoming increasingly clear that if we are to target CSCs therapeutically, it will likely be necessary to develop combination therapies.

An additional consideration is the relationship between CSCs and genetic heterogeneity within tumors. It is likely that the CSC compartment contains multiple subclones of CSCs with varying genetic alterations, which consequently have variations in properties such as frequency, differentiation potential, and degree of genetic instability, depending on the individual tissue of origin, the nature of the initiating (driver) mutation(s), and the stage of disease. As cancers progress, they may become more and more disorganized, and new signaling pathways may come into play. Thus it is becoming ever more complicated to understand tumor heterogeneity, and ultimately it will be important to develop improved CSC isolation methods, functional assays and single-cell analysis techniques to truly understand the tumor-propagating cells and their role in tumor initiation, progression, and metastasis, as well as therapy resistance and relapse.

Figure 1. The Notch, Wnt and Hedgehog signaling pathways

A. Notch signaling pathway: Binding of the Notch ligands (DLL/JAG) located in the membranes of adjacent cells to the Notch receptor triggers two consecutive proteolytic cleavages by ADAM and γ-secretase that releases an active intracellular domain (NICD). NICD translocates to the nucleus where it interacts with mastermind-like proteins (MAML) and CSL(CBF1/Suppressor of Hairless/LAG1)/RBPJ factors to activate transcription of Notch target genes.

B. Wnt signaling pathway: In the absence of the Wnt ligand, β-catenin is sequestered in a protein complex containing APC, Axin and GSK3β, and CK1, also referred to as the ‘destruction complex’. Phosphorylation of β-catenin within this complex targets it for proteolytic degradation. In the presence of Wnt, Wnt binding to the Frizzled/LRP5/6 receptor complex activates Dishevelled (Dvl) which disrupts the destruction complex. Phosphorylation of β-catenin is prevented leading to stabilization and accumulation of β-catenin. β-catenin translocates to the nucleus, displaces the repressor proteins Groucho and Histone deacetylase (HDAC), and interacts with TCF/LEF transcription factors to activate Wnt target genes.

C. Hedgehog signaling pathway: In the absence of the Hedgehog (Hh) ligand, Patched (Ptch) inhibits Smoothened (Smo) to prevent signal transduction to Gli factors. Gli1/2 factors are associated with Cos2 (Kif7), fused (Fu) and suppressor of fused (Sufu) and are phosphorylated by protein kinase 1 (PKA), CK1, and GSK3β leading to β-TrCP-mediated degradation. In the absence of Hh signaling, truncated Gli3-repressor family member dissociates from Sufu and binds and represses transcriptional activity of Hh target genes. In the presence of Hh, Hh binds to Ptch to relieve inhibition of Smo by Ptch, resulting in the activation and dissociation from Sufu/Fu/Cos2 (Kif7). Activated Gli1/2 transcription factors accumulate and translocate to the nucleus where they bind and activate Hh target genes.

Figure 2. Brain – Notch, Wnt and Shh signaling in normal and cancer stem cells

A. Notch: In normal brain cell development (left), Notch signaling promotes stem cell renewal and survival, promotes early precursor differentiation and proliferation (green arrows) and inhibits late differentiation stages (red line). Notch and signaling pathway members are up-regulated (green cloud) in brain cancers (right) resulting in over production of cells in the stem cell and precursor compartments (highlighted boxes in green). Experimental inhibition of the Notch signaling pathway results in increased cell differentiation (highlighted in red), apoptosis and depletion of the cancer stem cell and proliferative cell pool (highlighted in green).

B. Wnt: In normal brain cell development, Wnt signaling regulates stem cell self renewal and precursor proliferation (green arrows). Isolated Wnt-responsive cells (Axin2-LacZ+) show enriched sphere-forming ability *in vitro* that is reduced with the addition of Wnt inhibitors. Wnt and signaling pathway members are up-regulated and over-expressed (green cloud) in brain cancers (right) and are found to be more highly expressed within the CSC and precursor fractions (CD133⁺). Brain CSCs can form sphere-forming colonies, which is inhibited with the addition of Wnt inhibitors, and can initiate tumor growth *in vivo*. Both normal and cancer stem cells in the brain express stem cell-specific genes (CD133, Nestin, Sox2, Musashi and Bmi1). Patients with medulloblastoma have been categorized into a Subgroup A with the common feature of up-regulated Wnt signaling pathway.

C. Shh: Under normal conditions (left), Shh plays a role in neural stem cell maintenance, positional specification, precursor proliferation, brain growth and patterning (green arrows). In brain cancers (right) Shh signaling is deregulated and up-regulated (green cloud) within the cancer stem cell and precursor fractions (CD133⁺). In some cases, this de-regulation of Shh is due to *PTCH1* mutations. Subgroup B medulloblastomas represent a group of patients with over-expression of the Shh signaling pathway. Addition of Shh inhibitors results in reduced sphere-forming ability, increased apoptosis and sensitivity of cancer cells to radiation and chemotherapy.

Figure 3. Breast – Normal and cancer stem cells

Normal mammary stem cells were first isolated from mouse mammary tissue. These cells formed mammospheres in vitro, had a CD49fhiCD29hiCD24+Scal+ cell surface marker profile and are capable of regenerating an entire mammary organ. Human breast stem cells were also isolated and are enriched in the CD49f+EpCAMlow cell fraction. Normal stem cells give rise to a bipotent precursor cell which proceeds to follow the lineage restricting events for either myoepithelial or luminal differentiation.

Molecular analysis of several cancers has revealed that each subtype of breast cancer resembles distinct stage-specific cell types within the development of a stem cell to a differentiated cell.

Basal-like/Triple-negative tumors are molecularly similar to normal stem cells and precursor cells.

Luminal B tumors resemble late luminal progenitor cells and Luminal A tumors resemble differentiated luminal cells. Cancer stem cells with the expression CD44+CD24low (EpCAM+) and/or ALDH1+ initiate tumor growth and are enriched for mammosphere formation. One very important point is that CD44+CD24low cells may represent cancer stem cells particularly from very aggressive breast cancers (i.e. Basal-like and metastatic cancers) which in fact show a high CD44+CD24low phenotype. However, it is becoming clear that the CSC phenotype may differ among the different breast cancer subtypes

(Highlighted question mark).

Figure 4. Breast-Notch signaling in normal and cancer stem cells

In normal breast tissue (left), Notch signaling is important for the regulation of stem cell self renewal and proliferation (1) and also downstream for the commitment of bipotent cells into the myoepithelial lineage (2). Notch may also play a role in later differentiation of luminal progenitor cells (?Notch?). In breast cancer (right), Notch signaling factors are found to be up-regulated and enriched in CSCs (green cloud). Blocking Notch signaling reduces mammosphere formation, CD44+CD24low cell frequency and tumor formation. Notch 4 activation in mice results in the development of adenocarcinomas and Notch 1 activation in mice results in transformation of epithelial cells. These results suggest that Notch 4 may play a more important role earlier and is more efficient in cancer initiation, where as Notch 1 may

play a role later in the lineage-pathway and/or requires further mutations for cancer initiation and progression.

Figure 5. Colon–Notch and Wnt signaling in normal and cancer stem cells

A. Notch: Intestinal stem cells located at the base of the crypt are marked by LGR5 and Bmi1 expression and give rise to transit amplifying cells that proliferate and differentiate as they move up the villus. The normal stem cell also gives rise to paneth cells that move back adjacent to the stem cell providing a niche. Notch signaling is not well characterized in the normal colon, however, components of the pathway are expressed in the crypt areas. Experiments examining the effect of blocking the Notch pathway found that Notch is important for (1) regulating proliferation of stem and progenitor cells in the crypts; and (2) directing differentiation towards the enterocyte lineage. Colon cancers show up-regulation of Notch signaling factors that are enriched in the colon cancer stem cell (CD133⁺) fraction. Inhibition of Notch signaling results in reduced Hes1 expression, CSC frequency and tumor initiation in vivo. Intriguingly, Notch signaling appears to be downstream of Wnt signaling. Thus an initial aberrant Wnt signal (common in colon cancers) may in effect deregulate Notch activity, depicting just one example of how the effect of disrupting of one major pathway can affect another major pathway, opening up many more avenues for deregulation.

B. Wnt: In normal colon, a high level of Wnt is present in the base of the crypt and is required for stem cell maintenance. High Wnt levels and activity are observed in colon cancers and are enriched within the colon CSC fraction (1). Also, a hereditary defective allele (Apc⁻/⁻) (2) contributing to Wnt deregulation is observed in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis which results in numerous colon polyps or adenomas. Accumulation of further mutations results cancer progression. Nonetheless, aberrantly high levels of Wnt results in expansion of the stem cell and precursor pool.
