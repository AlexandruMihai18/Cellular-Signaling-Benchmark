ABSTRACT

Fungi are the cause of opportunistic infections, predominantly in immunocompromised individuals although, primary fungal infections can occur in apparently healthy individuals. Successful host defence requires an effective innate and adaptive immune response. Central to host immune responses are the induction of cytokines; the signals which help to activate the innate immune system and which play a central role in directing the development of pathogen-specific immunity. C-type lectins play a central role in the recognition and shaping of immune responses to fungal pathogens, in part, through the induction and modulation of cytokine responses. Understanding which cytokines induce protective responses to these pathogens and how C-type lectins and other receptors direct cytokine production may allow development of novel antifungal therapies. Here we review the C-type lectins, their influence on cytokine production and subsequent immune responses in antifungal immunity.

1. Introduction

1.1. Fungal infections of man

Fungi are ubiquitous in the environment, and we are constantly exposed to fungal spores and cells. These eukaryotic microbes are capable of causing a wide variety of infections, ranging from superficial skin and nail infections through to life-threatening invasive diseases (see Table 1). Skin and nail infections are associated with a number of dermatophytes, including Trichophyton spp., Microsporum spp. and Epidermophyton spp., causing infections such as athlete's foot and ringworm [1,2]. In addition, human commensal fungi can also cause skin infections, e.g. Candida spp., particularly Candida albicans, which are linked with intertrigo (inflammation of body folds, such as between the digits or under the breasts) and Malassezia spp. are associated with dandruff and pityriasis versicolor (skin rash and pigment changes) [1,2]. Candida spp. are also associated with oral and vaginal thrush and with chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis, where individuals suffer from recurrent skin, nail and/or mucosal infections [3–5].

Environmental fungi are the major causative agents of fungal lung infections, which are generally self-limiting. However, in immunocompromised individuals these infections can disseminate, leading to much more serious consequences. The major fungal species associated with lung infections are Aspergillus species (particularly Aspergillus fumigatus), Cryptococcus neoformans and Pneumocystis jirovecii (see Table 1). In specific regions of North, Central and South America, endemic fungi (Table 1) are also major causes of fungal lung disease [6–9].

The most serious fungal infections are invasive infections, which occur in immunocompromised and severely ill individuals and are associated with high mortality rates [4,10]. Fungi are the causative agents in ~20% of all invasive infections in ICU patients [10,11], with 90% of infections caused by C. albicans, Candida glabrata, Candida tropicalis, Candida parapsilosis and Candida krusei [4,10]. Pulmonary infections can also be the source of invasive fungal infection in immunocompromised individuals (see Table 1).

It is evident that most fungal infections are opportunistic; therefore, it is vital that the immune system is capable of recognising fungal cells and spores that enter the body and that it mounts an appropriate immune response to deal with the potential threat. This is accomplished through recognition of evolutionary conserved structures, the pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), on fungi by host cell pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), which include C-type lectin receptors (CLRs) and Toll-like receptors (TLRs) [12–18].

In the initial response to fungal infection, innate immune cells (neutrophils and macrophages) phagocytose invading pathogens

cytokine environment. In humans, genetic studies have identified a promoter mutation (−511T) of the IL-1β gene that increases susceptibility to invasive pulmonary aspergillosis [22]. In addition, a truncated allele of one of the NLRP3-inflammasome components, which is required for IL-1β processing, was also found to increase susceptibility to fungal infection, with lower IL-1β production and increased incidence of vulvovaginal candidiasis in women with this allele [23].

The importance of Th17 responses in C. albicans immunity is evident, with IL-23p19−/− and IL-17RA−/− mice showing greater susceptibility to systemic infection [24,25]. The Th17-related cytokines IL-17F and IL-22 have also been linked to mucosal-specific immunity [26,27]. In humans, genetic studies of inherited conditions known to predispose individuals to mycoses, usually Candida infections, have demonstrated an important role for Th17 responses. These conditions include HIES (hyper IgE syndrome) and APECED (autoimmune polyendocrinopathy with candidiasis and ectodermal dystrophy), which are both associated with recurrent mucocutaneous candidiasis [27]. HIES has been linked to mutation in STAT3, an important regulator of cytokines [28], which results in low or no production of IL-17 and, hence, no Th17 cells [29]. Analysis of STAT1 mutations in patients with CMC have revealed autosomal dominant gain of function mutations that suppress Th17 [30], and Th1/Th17 cytokine responses [31] via STAT1 mediated suppression of STAT3 function. APECED is a rare autosomal recessive disease, with mutations occurring in the autoimmune regulator (AIRE) gene, allowing production of autoantibodies against IL-17A, IL-17F and IL-22 [32,33]. Further, an autosomal recessive mutation in the IL-17RA gene and an autosomal dominant mutation in the IL-17F gene have recently been described in a patient suffering from CMC [33]. These studies highlight the essential role of Th17 cells in preventing mucocutaneous fungal infections.

Th1 cells are induced by the action of IL-12 and produce IFN-γ, which activates phagocytes, and these T-cell subsets also play a key role in antifungal immunity [34] (see Fig. 1). The importance of both IL-12 and IFN-γ in forming a protective Th1 response was demonstrated, for example, in a murine study using blocking antibodies against these cytokines in a model of pulmonary C. neoformans infection [35]. Blocking antibodies resulted in increased lung fungal burdens and a skewing of T cell responses from a protective Th1 to a non-protective IL-4 Th2 response. In a C. albicans study, IL-12p40, a subunit of both IL-12 and IL-23, was shown to be important for mucosal, but not systemic, defence [36]. These mouse studies support a recent human genetic study where two unrelated individuals suffering from concurrent Mycobacterium bovis and C. albicans infections shared a common homozygous mutation in the IL12RB1 gene (1791 + 2 T > G), which was also present in their heterozygous parents [35]. This mutation resulted in no expression of the IL-12 receptor β1 subunit, which subsequently led to low IFN-γ production by peripheral blood cells in vitro [37].

Th2 responses induced in response to IL-4 are thought to be non-protective in fungal infections, via the suppression of protective Th1 responses and the alternative activation of macrophages [38]. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from patients suffering from CMC produced a Th2 cytokine profile, compared to a Th1 profile in healthy controls when stimulated in vitro with Candida antigen. C. albicans strains that are highly virulent and also avirulent strains which fail to induce protective immune responses, produce a Th2 profile cytokine response in mice [39].

The balance between IL-17 producing Th17 and IL-10 producing Treg cells has been demonstrated to be important in control of fungal infection, e.g. in clearance of Histoplasma capsulatum [40]. In CCR5 deficient mice, where IL-17 levels were increased and there was a decrease in recruitment of Tregs, H. capsulatum infection was more effectively cleared. Conversely, the use of anti-IL-17 antibodies increased Treg numbers and persistence of fungal infection

via cell surface receptors which contain internalisation motifs. Signalling cascades initiated during this process activate the phagocyte, leading to killing of the pathogen via the respiratory burst, and also stimulate the release of immune-activating cytokines and the presentation of fungal antigen(s) to the adaptive immune system. Numerous cytokines (e.g. IL-1β, IL-12, IL-17, IL-23, and TNF-α), induced via PRR signalling pathways have been shown, primarily through infection studies in knockout mice, to be important in directing innate and adaptive response to fungal pathogens. Importantly, gene association studies in humans have identified polymorphisms in cytokine and cytokine-related genes that predispose individuals to fungal infection (see later) [19]. The initial proinflammatory cytokines that are released act to mobilise the innate immune system against invading fungi through the activation and recruitment of neutrophils, macrophages and dendritic cells, amongst others. Once activated, the innate immune system, via antigen presenting cells (APCs), initiates, sustains and regulates the adaptive immune response, controlling microbial growth and facilitating microbial clearance (Fig. 1). APCs induce naive CD4+ T cells to differentiate into Th1, Th2, or Th17 effector cells that are characterised by IFN-γ, IL-4, and IL-17 secretion, respectively, with IL-10-producing regulatory T cells (Tregs) acting to control effector responses and prevent damage to the host. Here we shall discuss the roles of a selection of the major cytokines linked to antifungal immunity.

### 1.2. The role of selected cytokines and T-cell subsets in antifungal immunity

Th17 cells are a relatively recently characterised T helper subset and have emerged as having major roles in host defences against fungi [15]. A number of cytokines are involved in the induction of Th17 cells (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-21, IL-23, and TGF-β), which in turn produce other cytokines (notably IL-17A and IL-17F, but also IL-21, IL-22) (see Fig. 1). IL-1β produced by innate cells is a key cytokine in antifungal immunity [20,21], leading to a Th17 favouring

[40]. Genetic studies in humans have revealed a dual role, protective and non-protective, for IL-10 in fungal infection. SNPs in the IL-10 gene promoter appear to be important, with one haplotype (−1082A/−819C/−592C) conferring protection from aspergillosis [41], whilst other mutations at position −1082 in the IL-10 promoter increase susceptibility to infection [42,43].

Both IL-6 and G-CSF promote neutrophil production and function. G-CSF mice are neutropenic and therefore susceptible to Candida infections. A study using a double IL-6⁻/⁻, G-CSF⁻/⁻ knockout mouse, in a model of C. albicans infection revealed these mice more were susceptible to *Candida* infection than G-CSF⁻/⁻ mice indicating a role for IL-6 in granulopoiesis. Although these mice had deficient neutrophils, both IFN-γ and TNF-α responses were unimpaired leading to normal peritoneal macrophage activation [44].

The proinflammatory cytokine TNF-α also plays an important role in fungal immunity. Indeed, TNF⁻/⁻ mice have increased fungal burdens due to reduced activation of neutrophils [45]. The protective nature of TNF-α has also been demonstrated in humans. Individuals homozygous for A/A at position −308 in the TNFα gene promoter show increased TNF-α levels and are more resistant to aspergillosis [43]. Therefore, delineating the role of cytokines involved in host responses to fungal infections and the receptors which induce and regulate their expression will lead to advances in understanding and treatment of fungal infections.

Chemokines and chemokine receptors are also required for host defence against fungal infections. For example, both KC/CXCL1 and MIP-2/CXCL2 have been shown to be upregulated, and vital for neutrophil recruitment, in response to a number of fungal species including *A. fumigatus* [46]. Impaired production of MCP-1/CCL2, MIP-1α/CCL3, MIP-1β/CCL4, and KC, have been observed in models of fungal infection in susceptible gene knockout mice [47,48]. Elevated levels of both MIP-1α and RANTES/CCL5 have been observed in mice sensitised to *A. fumigatus* upon rechallenge. Deletion of the receptor for both these chemokines, CCR1, resulted in less subepithelial fibrosis possibly though increased IFN-γ production [49].

However in an earlier study, unsensitised mice with CCR1 deficiency showed increased mortality and less neutrophil recruitment to the lungs in response to *A. fumigatus* [50]. Th17 cells express CCR2, CCR4 and CCR6 [51], which is also expressed on Treg [52], whereas CXCR3, CXCR6 and CCR5 are Th1 associated receptors [51]. The chemokine receptor CCR2 primarily binds the monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, and has been shown to have a protective role in *A. fumigatus* lung infection [53]. CCR2⁻/⁻ mice showed reduced clearance of *A. fumigatus* conidia and reduced recruitment of neutrophils to the lungs. Also, increased levels of non-protective Th2 cytokines IL-5 and IL-13, and eosinophil recruiting Eotaxin/CCL11 and RANTES, were observed in CCR2⁻/⁻ mice which reflected increased eosinophil recruitment to the lungs [53]. DCs deficient in CCR7 have been shown to be more resistant to *A. fumigatus* with increased levels of TNF-α, CXCL10, and CXCL2 [54].

### 1.3. Pattern recognition receptors in antifungal immunity

As mentioned above, the ability of innate immune cells to recognise invading pathogens, relies on PRRs. The first major family of PRRs to be described were the Toll-like receptors (TLRs), and a number of these receptors have been linked to fungal immunity, including TLR2, TLR4 and TLR9 [55]. Most TLRs described signal via MyD88, activating NF-κB to initiate host cytokine responses. MyD88⁻/⁻ mice are highly susceptible to fungal infections [56], which also reflects the involvement of MyD88 in IL-1 signalling. TLRs are thought to be important in antifungal immunity, although a number of studies have revealed contradictory results concerning the involvement of individual TLRs in fungal infections which may be fungal strain related [57]. In addition, TLRs also collaborate with other PRRs, such as the C-type lectin receptors (CLRs), to tailor host immune responses [58]. A number of polymorphisms of TLRs have been identified in humans which have been linked to increased susceptibility to fungal infections [57]. However, in humans, mutations in the downstream signalling molecule MyD88 are associated
with bacterial infections caused by Staphylococcus or Pseudomonas, and not fungi, leading to the proposal that TLRs are not essential for host defence to these pathogens [59].

The CLRs encompass a diverse family of proteins unified by the possession of at least one C-type lectin domain (CTLD), a structurally conserved motif that recognises an array of both endogenous and exogenous ligands, often in a calcium-dependent manner [60]. CLRs are commonly expressed on myeloid cells of the immune system, but are also expressed on mucosal epithelial cells where the host is in contact with the microbial flora and potential pathogens, e.g. the gut and respiratory tract. Some CLRs directly activate intracellular signalling cascades via intrinsic signalling motifs, whilst others make use of adaptor molecules to initiate signal transduction [60].

Pathogens possess multiple PAMPs on their surface and can engage multiple PRRs expressed on host leucocytes, including the TLRs and CLRs. CLR signalling cascades can act to promote, modulate or repress cytokine production in host cells, helping to determine the host immune response and outcome of infection. The combined signalling from the multiple host PRRs activated by a pathogen, collaborate to produce a pathogen-specific cytokine profile, and subsequent immune response [61]. Current research is beginning to unravel the collaborative nature of PRR interactions both within and between families of PRRs. Understanding how CLRs interact with other PRRs and pathogens, and how this influences immune mechanisms will aid in the development of future therapeutics. In this review we shall discuss cell-associated CLRs (Dectin-1, Dectin-2, DC-SIGN, Mincle and the mannose receptor) and the collectins, a group of soluble CLRs, all of which have been implicated in inducing or modulating cytokines in response to fungi.

## 2. C-type lectin receptors, cytokines and antifungal immunity

### 2.1. Dectin-1 (Clec7a)

Dectin-1 is the archetypical CLR and was first identified on dendritic cells [62]. It has since been shown to be expressed on other myeloid cells (e.g. neutrophils and macrophages) and on some other cell types, including γδ T cells and mucosal epithelia [63–65]. Dectin-1 is a glycosylated type II transmembrane protein, consisting of a single calcium-independent extracellular CTLD, a stalk region linking the CTLD via a transmembrane region to an intracellular tail, which contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation-like motif (ITAM-like, also referred to as a HemITAM) [60]. Alternative splicing produces two major Dectin-1 isoforms, which vary by the inclusion, or exclusion, of the stalk region [63]; and in the murine system this has been demonstrated to impact on cytokine expression [63,66]. For example, DBA/2 mice were shown to express the full length Dectin-1 protein, whereas C57BL/6 mice expressed a truncated form, and DBA/2 macrophages were found to produce more TNF-α and IL-6 than C57BL/6 macrophages in response to *Coccidioides posadasii* formalin-killed spherules. Likewise, DBA/2 DCs produced more IL-12p70 and IL-23p19, but less IL-10 than C57BL/6 DCs [66]. Dectin-1 cellular expression levels can be regulated by a variety of signals, such as cytokines and microbial components. The highest Dectin-1 expression levels are found at mucosal surfaces, such as the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts, suggesting a role for Dectin-1 in immunosurveillance [67]. Dectin-1 specifically recognises β-1,3-glucan, a carbohydrate found in the cell wall of fungi, plants and some bacteria [47]. In addition, Dectin-1 can recognise unidentified endogenous T cell and mycobacterial ligands [68].

Upon binding of its ligands Dectin-1 activates a number of cellular responses, including phagocytosis, ROS production and the production of numerous cytokines via multiple signalling pathways. The best characterised Dectin-1 signalling pathway is the Syk-CARD9 pathway, which leads to the activation of the canonical NFκB subunits, c-Rel and p65, and, subsequently, the production of pro-IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, IL-23 and TNF-α (Fig. 2) [69]. In DCs, PLC-γ2 is essential for Dectin-1 signalling, with defective secretion of IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, IL-23, and TNF-α observed in PLC-γ2-deficient cells [70]. In addition, unlike most other PRRs, Dectin-1 can also activate the noncanonical NFκB subunit RelB in a NIK-dependent pathway [71]. This pathway allows modulation of cytokine production via the formation of inactive RelB-p65 dimers and the modulation of NF-κB gene transcription, reducing IL-1β and IL-12p40, whilst increasing the expression of CCL17 and CCL22 [16]. NFκB gene expression is further regulated by the kinase Raf-1, that is activated by Dectin-1 in a Syk-independent fashion. Raf-1 activation leads to an increase in p65 transcriptional activity and the reduction of RelB activity via the formation of inactive p65-RelB dimers, which is important for inducing pro Th1/Th17 cytokine profiles though increased expression of cytokines IL-1β and IL-12p40. In addition to the Syk/Dectin-1 induced transcription of pro IL-1β, Syk/Dectin-1 signalling also activates the NLRP3 inflammasome in a ROS-dependent manner, leading to production of bioactive IL-1β [72,73]. Inflammasome activation by Dectin-1 may be important in the balance between tolerance to commensal flora and inflammation at mucosal surfaces. In particular, this pathway may be involved in discrimination between colonisation and invasion of the commensal *C. albicans*, through differential recognition of yeast and hyphal forms. Morphological transition from the yeast to hyphal form has been suggested as a signal allowing host discrimination between colonisation and invasion by this fungus [74]. Macrophages fail to secrete IL-1β in response to the yeast form, but responded to hyphae by producing IL-1β primarily in a Dectin-1-mediated manner [74]. In addition to NFκB mediated gene transcription, IL-2 and IL-10 can also be induced by Dectin-1 via the calcium-mediated NFAT pathway in both macrophages and DCs stimulated with *C. albicans* or zymosan, a fungal particle extracted from *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* [75].

In vitro studies using Dectin-1 agonists have revealed cell-specific cytokine production, with Dectin-1⁻/⁻ macrophages showing reduced IL-10 and IL-12p40 production in response to zymosan, but dendritic cells showed no such alteration in cytokine production. This may be a reflection of the wealth of PRRs that can respond to *C. albicans* expressed on DCs [47]. However, stimulation of DCs with the Dectin-1 specific agonist curdlan, showed a bias in CD4⁺ cell differentiation towards Th17/Th1 through the production of IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-23, and low IL-10 and IL-12p70. In contrast, zymosan-stimulated DCs induced a low Th17/Th1 and high IL-10 Treg response [76]. The nature of these ligands may explain the differences in the role of Dectin-1 observed between the two studies; curdlan is a Dectin-1 specific agonist whereas zymosan activates TLR2 as well as Dectin-1 (costimulation is discussed in more detail below). Further investigations into the differences in cytokine expression between macrophages and DCs in response to zymosan have revealed differences within cell type, dependent on the origin of the in vivo derived cell population. Thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal macrophages failed to produce TNF-α upon stimulation with deleted zymosan, a β glucan rich derivative of zymosan. In contrast, alveolar macrophages were able to produce TNFα in response to depleted zymosan. Likewise, DC populations also showed differences in their responses to depleted zymosan, with GM-CSF-derived BMBCs producing TNF-α, and Flt3L-derived BMDCs failing to produce TNF-α [77]. Interesting, thioglycollate-elicited macrophages cultured with GM-CSF were able to produce TNF-α in response to curdlan, whereas those stimulated without GM-CSF failed to produce TNF-α [78]. Therefore the ability of different cell populations to respond to β-glucan may be dependent upon the local environment in which they are primed [78]. The

underlying responses for these differences are still not understood, but may involve differential utilization of CARD9.

Both murine and human studies have established a central role for Dectin-1 in antifungal immunity. Dectin-1 recognises a number of pathogenic fungal species, including *A. fumigatus*, *C. albicans*, *Coccidioides* sp., spores of *C. neoformans*, *H. capsulatum*, and *P. jirovecii*, via β-1,3-glucan exposed in the fungal cell wall [79–84]. Dectin-1 was demonstrated to be required for antifungal defence against *Pneumocystis jirovecii* [85], *C. albicans* [47] and *A. fumigatus* [48]. However, inconsistent results over the involvement of Dectin-1 in *C. albicans* immunity have been highlighted, which is thought to derive from the different *C. albicans* strains used in the two studies, which may differ in the accessibility of the fungal cell wall β-glucan to Dectin-1. Indeed, a recent study by Netea et al. clearly demonstrated that Dectin-1 recognised a range of *C. albicans* strains [86]. In all of these knock-out models, regardless of the fungal species used, differences in cytokine production were observed, with, Dectin-1 deficiency resulting in impaired IL-1α, IL-1β, , IL-6, IL-23, TNF-α, G-CSF, GM-CSF, CCL3/MIP-1α, CCL4/MIP-1β, and CXCL1/KC production [47,48,85]. Impaired cytokine production

resulted in insufficient myeloid cell recruitment to sites of infection, allowing uncontrolled fungal growth [48].

Dectin-1 mediated cytokine production has been shown to influence T cell polarisation. Dectin-1⁻/⁻ mice infected intratracheally with *A. fumigatus* showed reduced levels of key Th17 cytokines (IL-17, IL-12p40 and IL-23) and a dominant IL-12p40/IFN-γ producing Th1 response, with increased fungal lung fungal burdens relative to wild type infected animals [87]. Depletion of IL-17 with neutralising antibodies had a similar effect, confirming the protective role of IL-17 in host defence against *A. fumigatus* [48]. However, in response to *C. albicans*, Dectin-1 appears to play a less important role, with Dectin-2 being more involved in inducing Th17 responses [88]. A balanced Th1/Th17 response, rather than either a Th1 or Th17 response, is therefore believed to be the most effective antifungal defence [48].

These murine and in vitro studies support recent genetic studies in humans which have revealed Dectin-1 polymorphisms that predispose patients to mucocutaneous fungal infections [89,90]. A single nucleotide polymorphism, which introduces an early stop codon in Dectin-1 (Y238X), preventing functional Dectin-1 protein

being expressed at the cell surface, resulted in recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis or onychomycosis [89], increased oral and gastrointestinal colonisation by *Candida* spp. [90] and increased susceptibility to invasive aspergillosis [91,92]. This increased susceptibility to fungal infection was shown to be due to reduced β-glucan recognition by cells expressing the Dectin-1 polymorphism resulting in defective production of cytokines, including IL-17, IL-10, IL -1β-, IFN-γ, TNF-α and IL-6 [89,90,92]. In contrast to the Y238X polymorphism, the identification of a second Dectin-1 SNP (I233S), identified in an African HIV population, showed a protective effect on oropharyngeal candidiasis, due to reduced production of IFN-γ [93].

Mutations in the components of the downstream Dectin-1 and other CLR signalling pathways (see Fig 2) also affect antifungal immunity, and are associated with rarer forms of inherited chronic mucocutaneous fungal infections. A premature stop codon mutation in CARD9 (Q295X) resulted in low expression of CARD9, reduced TNF-α production and greatly reduced numbers of Th17 cells [94], increasing susceptibility to mucocutaneous infection. In mouse studies, bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDC) from Card9⁻/⁻ mice also exhibited severe cytokine defects in response to *C. albicans*, with delayed NF-κB activation and much reduced TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-2 production [95]. These mice are also more susceptible to systemic fungal infection, with reduced survival and higher fungal burdens in the kidneys, lung and liver [94]. In addition, IkBα-deficient (NK-κB deficient) patients were also more susceptible *C. albicans* infection [96], confirming that these signalling pathways are required for the control of fungal infections.

Synergy between PRRs in cytokine production is a vital part in understanding host responses to pathogens. Collaborative signalling between Dectin-1 and TLR2 has been shown to induce Th17 responses via the production of prostaglandin E2, which in turn upregulates the production of the pro-Th17 cytokines, IL-6 and IL-23 [97]. Dectin-1/TLR2 enhanced production of IL-6 and IL-23 was also shown in an earlier study by Dennehy et al., as well as increased IL-10 and decrease IL-12 production [98]. In addition, Dectin-1/TLR2 collaborative signalling has also been demonstrated though in vitro stimulation of thioglycollate elicited macrophages with specific Dectin-1 and TLR2 agonists, where Dectin-1 mediated upregulation of TLR2-induced TNF-α, MIP-1α and MIP-2 production [99]. As previously mentioned, collaboration between Dectin-1 and TLR-2 can be cell specific, with macrophages requiring Dectin-1/TLR2 co-stimulation to produce TNF-α, whereas stimulation of Dectin-1 in DCs is sufficient to initiate TNF-α production (although this can be enhanced by TLR signalling) [47,60]. In addition, Dectin-1 induced cytokine production can be modulated by other cell membrane PRRs such as CD63, which down regulates IL-6 production in response to zymosan [100].

### 2.2. Dectin-2 (Clec4n)

Dectin-2 is a glycosylated type II transmembrane protein first identified in a DC line [101] and has since been shown to be expressed on myeloid cells, including tissue macrophages and inflammatory monocytes [102]. Dectin-2 contains a traditional calcium-dependent sugar binding CTLD which recognises a diverse range of fungal species, including *C. albicans*, *Microsporum audouii* and *Paracoccidioides brasiliensis* [103]. Dectin-2 has been shown to bind allergens from the house dust mite and, more recently, to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome in response to the helminth *Schistosoma mansoni* [104,105]. Similarly to Dectin-1, Dectin-2 can recognise an unidentified T cell ligand [106]. Dectin-2 was originally shown to recognise high mannose and, more recently, was demonstrated to recognise α-mannan structures [88,107,108].

Dectin-2, unlike Dectin-1, cannot signal directly via its short cytoplasmic tail, but instead associates with the ITAM-containing FcRγ to initiate signalling via the Syk-CARD9 pathway [107]. Activation of Dectin-2 results in the preferential expression of the NF-κB subunit c-Rel, and not other NF-κB subunits, and this which depends upon Malt1 activity [69]. The resulting IL-1β and IL-23p19 production skews CD4⁺ T cell responses towards a Th17 profile, revealing a specific role for Dectin-2 in immunity (Fig. 2). An earlier study by Robinson et al. also demonstrated a central role for Dectin-2 in Th17, but not Th1, responses to *C. albicans*, however, this also required the action of Dectin-1 [109]. Dectin-2 signalling has been shown to be involved in induction of a number of cytokines upon exposure to *C. albicans*, with Dectin-2⁻/⁻ BMDCs showing reduced IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-23 and TNFα production in response to the yeast form of *C. albicans* [88]. Interestingly, in the same study, cytokine responses to the *C. albicans* hyphal form were only partially reduced in Dectin-2⁻/⁻ BMDCs, suggesting that PRRs other than Dectin-2 recognise the hyphal form of this pathogen. However, in a more recent study, Dectin-2 was shown to have an essential role in cytokine production in response to *C. albicans* hyphae, with loss of IL-10, TNF-α and IL-12p40 production in Dectin-2-deficient bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDM) [110]. Hyphal-specific signalling pathway required CARD9-regulated ubiquitination of IKK [110]. The importance of these in vitro studies has been demonstrated in murine survival studies, which have revealed an essential role for Dectin-2 in defence against systemic *C. albicans* infection, with reduced survival and increased fungal organ burdens compared to wild type mice [88,109]. Although no SNPs have yet been identified in humans which affect the structure and/or function of Dectin-2, in vitro studies using human DCs have demonstrated reduced IL-1β and IL-23p19 and increased IL-6 and IL-12p35 in response to *C. albicans* in the presence of anti-Dectin-2 antibodies [69].

#### 2.3. Mannose receptor (CD206)

The mannose receptor (MR) is predominantly expressed intracellularly as part of the endocytic pathway of macrophages and some subsets of DCs, as well as by a variety of other cells, including endothelial cells [111,112]. In addition, a soluble form of the MR can be shed from cells by the cleavage of the membrane bound protein by metalloproteinases. In fungal infections, release of the MR extracellular domain as a functional soluble MR is mediated by Dectin-1 signalling [113]. Structurally the MR is a type I transmembrane protein that contains an extracellular region consisting of a cysteine rich domain, a fibronectin type II domain, eight CTLDs and a short cytoplasmic tail [114] (Fig. 2). The MR recognises both fucose and terminal mannose structures, enabling it to recognise a range of fungal pathogens, including *C. albicans* [115] and *P. jirovecii* [116], as well as bacterial, viral and endogenous ligands [112]. The MR cytoplasmic tail is devoid of any classical signalling motifs, with downstream molecular signalling mechanisms currently undefined. However, the MR has been shown to induce production of a number of cytokines, including IL-8, IL-10, IL-17, TNF-α, and MCP-1 [117,118]. Paradoxically the MR can also inhibit production of cytokines such as TNF-α in response to unopsonized *Pneumocystis* [118,119]. Collaborative cytokine responses between the MR and TLR2 or TLR4 have been observed for IL-10 and for MR and TLR4 in TNF-α production in response to gp43, a glycoprotein secreted by *P. brasiliensis* [120].

Despite the demonstration of MR-mediated cytokine responses to fungal pathogens, the role of the MR in fungal infection remains unclear as no human SNPs have been identified which affect the structure and function of the MR. In mice, in vivo studies with MR knockout mice showed no alteration in susceptibility to *C. albicans* and *P. carinii* infection [121,122]. However, MR knockout
mice were more susceptible to *C. neoformans* infection, with reduced survival and increased fungal burdens due to a failure to develop significant protective CD4 T cell responses \[123\]. In vitro, it has also been shown that signalling via the MR can induce IL-17 production in response to *C. albicans*, a key cytokine in host defence against fungal infections. This response is amplified by TLR2/Dectin-1 pathways, demonstrating further collaboration between PRRs in tailoring immune responses \[124\]. Collaboration between TLR2 and the MR was also shown by increased IL-8 production in response to *P. carinii* \[125\]. Interestingly not all MR ligands induce the same cytokine responses; mannose capped lipoarabinomannan (Man-LAM), a mycobacterial cell envelope molecule, and biglycan, an extracellular matrix proteoglycan, increase IL-10 and decrease IL-12 production, whereas mannan had no effect upon cytokine production \[112\]. Thus, differences in cell wall structure and composition of different fungal pathogens may explain the observed differences in murine survival studies in the MR knockout mouse. Further data and the use of additional fungal species are required to confirm and extend these observations.

### 2.4. Mincle

Originally identified as a LPS-inducible protein \[126\], Mincle (macrophage inducible C-type lectin) is a type II transmembrane protein, containing a single extracellular CTLD, expressed predominantly on activated macrophages, although it may also be expressed on some other myeloid cell populations (Fig. 1) \[127\]. Mincle expression is nominally low, but expression is upregulated upon exposure to inducing signals, such as TLR ligands and cytokines \[128\]. Mincle associates with FcRγ via a positively charged amino acid in the transmembrane region to initiate signalling via recruitment of Syk and the resultant activation of the CARD9 pathway, leading to expression of a number of cytokines and chemokines, including IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α, KC and MIP-2 \[129\]. Mincle binds a range of endogenous and exogenous ligands, such as SAP130 released by necrotic host cells, mycobacterial glycolipid trehalose-6,6-dimycolate (TDM) and fungi, including *Candida, Malassezia* and *Saccharomyces* species, via α-mannose in a calcium-dependent fashion \[127,129–131\].

To date no human SNPs have been identified which affect the structure and function of Mincle. However, Mincle-deficient mice show increased susceptibility to systemic candidiasis, with increased kidney fungal burdens and reduced TNF-α production at day 5 post-infection \[131\]. In vivo studies of *Malassezia* are limited due to the low pathogenicity of this fungus in mice, however, despite this limitation, an initial study has revealed reduced neutrophil recruitment and production of IL-10, KC, MIP-2 and TNF-α using peritoneal *Malassezia* infections \[129\]. Interestingly, in this study, Mincle did not recognise *C. albicans* \[129\]. Again, as in contradictory Dectin-1 studies (discussed above), different *C. albicans* strains were used in the two studies, possibly reflecting the different cell wall composition between species of *Candida*.

Although not yet shown for fungi, Mincle can induce Th1/Th17 adaptive immunity in response to the mycobacterial cell wall glycolipid TDM and its synthetic analogue trehalose-6,6dibehenate (TDB) \[127\]. In vitro, Mincle⁻/⁻ macrophages showed abrogated IL-6 and G-CSF production in response to TDB \[127\], and Mincle⁻/⁻ mice immunized with TDB as an adjuvant showed reduced cellularity in the draining lymph nodes and decreased IFN-γ and IL-17 production upon restimulation of lymph node cells. Since IL-17 and Th17 responses are essential for mucosal defence against fungi \[24,132\] Mincle may have an, as yet, unidentified role in Th17 response against fungal pathogens at the mucosa.

### 2.5. DC-SIGN

DC-SIGN (DC-specific ICAM-3 grabbing non-integrin) is a type II transmembrane protein expressed on DCs, endothelial cells and on some macrophage subpopulations \[133,134\]. In humans there are two closely related proteins, L-SIGN and LSECtin, and eight orthologs in mice of DC-SIGN that differ in their expression and structure \[135,136\]. DC-SIGN consists of a single calcium-dependent extracellular CTLD that recognises high mannose and fucosylated structures, linked via a stalk and transmembrane region to a cytoplasmic tail containing the YXXL motif that was originally suggested to have a role in signalling \[67,137\]. However recent evidence suggests that this motif is not involved in DC-SIGN-mediated signalling \[138\]. The complete signalling mechanisms of DC-SIGN are yet to be defined, however, it is known that DC-SIGN is constitutively associated with a signalosome, consisting of three scaffold proteins (LSP-1, KSR-1 and CNK) and the kinase Raf-1 \[139\]. DC-SIGN is found at the cell surface as tetramers \[140\], linked via interactions between the monomer stalk regions and recognises numerous pathogens, including a variety of fungal species, e.g. *A. fumigatus, Candida* sp. and the dermatophyte *Chrysosporium tropicum* \[141,142\].

DC-SIGN does not itself induce cytokine expression, but modulates activation of NF-κB occurring in response to signalling from other PRRs \[104\]. DC-SIGN signalling appears to be ligand-specific, e.g. in response to the tick protein Salp15, Raf-1 activation does not acetylate p65, but instead activates MEK, a mitogen-activated protein kinase, leading to suppression of TLR-mediated IL-6, IL-12 and TNF-α production \[143\]. It remains to be seen whether fungal species also activate MEK. This ligand specific signalling may impact on responses to fungal infections. DC-SIGN recognition of mannose-containing microbes, including pathogenic fungi, results in the recruitment of further effectors to the signalosome, leading to the phosphorylation and acetylation of the NF-κB subunit p65, prolonging its activity and increasing transcription of IL-10, IL-6, IL-12p35 and IL-12p40 (also a subunit of IL-23) \[139\]. However, in response to fucose-containing microbes, three of the signalosome components, KSR-1, CNK and Raf-1, are actively dissociated from the signalosome, with only increased IL-10 expression occurring in response to these pathogens \[139\]. This could potentially lead to differential immune responses to some fungi, as some contain fucose in their cell walls \[144\], although this remains to be shown. DC-SIGN, therefore, has the potential to modulate downstream signalling of any PRR that activates NF-κB subunit p65, including subsequent cytokine gene expression \[145\].

In addition to modulating TLR signalling, DC-SIGN also inhibits Dectin-1 induced Th17 responses to *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* though the inhibition of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-23, and TNF-α production, resulting in an increased Th1 response \[146\]. Thus DC-SIGN acts as an immunoregulatory receptor that may act to control excessive inflammation and damage to host tissues through production of IL-10, although this signalling pathway has been proposed to be exploited by some pathogens such as *Ixodes* ticks \[143\] and HIV \[147\] to avoid the immune system. The effect of DC-SIGN on Dectin-1 responses to fungal pathogens remains to be elucidated. However, in humans DC-SIGN is known to be involved in fungal immunity, with a DC-SIGN promoter mutation (−139A/G) resulting in resistance to invasive aspergillosis \[148\].

Of the eight murine homologues, only SIGNR1, and SIGNR3 have been shown to bind fungal ligands (heat killed *C. albicans* and zymosan) \[149\]. AntiSIGNR1 antibodies induce the production of IL-12 and TNF-α, however this has not been shown for fungal ligands \[150\]. In contrast SIGNR1 has been shown to collaborate with Dectin-1 in the nonopsonic recognition of *C. albicans* but was not involved in the induction of TNF-α \[151\].
cytokines, will better aid the development of specific therapies and possibly vaccines against fungal pathogens in the future.
