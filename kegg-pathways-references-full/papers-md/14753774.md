commonly used method for the analysis of nitroaromatics is HPLC with UV detection due to its widespread availability [3,15], while HPLC combined with MS and electrochemical detection (ED) are also viable but less frequently available methods of detection [13,14,19,20].

The analysis of explosives using HPLC continues to present challenges [3]. Previously published
Two mobile phases were utilized to establish the gradient system. The organic mobile phase was HPLC-grade methanol. The aqueous mobile phase consisted of either 0.025 M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7) with or without 0.1% or 0.5% w/w 1-octanesulfonic acid (ion-pair reagent), or of a phosphate buffer (0

developed gradient method would be capable of separating all 23 chemicals investigated in this study ranging from the very polar TAT to the less polar nitrotoluene, azoxy, and azo compounds in a single run.

Various temperatures were investigated (data not shown) and it was found that the same temperature used for the optimal separation of EPA Method 8330 compounds (50.5 °C)
