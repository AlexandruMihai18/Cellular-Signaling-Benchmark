**A B S T R A C T**

The activity of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis is characterized by an ultradian (pulsatile) pattern of hormone secretion. Pulsatility of glucocorticoids has been found critical for optimal transcriptional, neuroendocrine and behavioral responses. This review will focus on the mechanisms underlying the origin of the glucocorticoid ultradian rhythm. Our recent research shows that the ultradian rhythm of glucocorticoids depends on highly dynamic processes within adrenocortical steroidogenic cells. Furthermore, we have evidence that disruption of these dynamics leads to abnormal glucocorticoid secretion observed in disease and critical illness in both humans and rats.

cognitive processes necessary to cope with a threatening situation (De Kloet, 2004). Glucocorticoids also regulate the activity of the HPA axis, and thus their own production, through feedback mechanisms acting at the level of the PVN and the pituitary gland, where they inhibit the release of CRH and AVP (Dallman et al., 1987a, 1987b; Jones et al., 1977), and ACTH (Jones et al., 1977) respectively. Furthermore, glucocorticoids can indirectly regulate HPA axis activity via modulation of other brain structures, including the hippocampus, the amygdala and the prefrontal cortex, which, in turn, regulate the activity of the PVN (Ulrich-Lai and Herman, 2009).

Under basal (i.e., unstressed) conditions, ACTH and glucocorticoids display a highly dynamic pattern that is characterized by both a circadian and an ultradian rhythm of hormone secretion. Indeed, circadian variations in glucocorticoids levels over the 24-hour cycle are not made up of a smooth change in hormone levels, but is in fact characterized by a rapid ultradian, pulsatile pattern of hormone secretion, with a periodicity of approximately 1 hour in the rat (Fig. 1). The ultradian rhythm of glucocorticoids was first described in the rat by Jasper and Engeland (1991). By using intra-adrenal microdialysis techniques in non-stressed freely behaving animals they observed that, in addition to the hourly corticosterone pulse frequency, both the ultradian frequency and amplitude of the pulses were modulated in a circadian manner (Jasper and Engeland, 1994). The ultradian rhythm of corticosterone has been also investigated in the rat plasma by using an automated blood-sampling system (Clark et al., 1986) that allows collection of small blood samples at a high frequency (e.g. every 5–10 minutes) for an extended periods of time (Windle et al., 1998b) in unstressed and freely moving rats over the whole 24-hour cycle. During the last 25 years our group has used this automated sampling system to show that, consistent with previous findings, the pulsatile corticosterone rhythm is maintained in the blood, with an ultradian frequency similar to that observed in the adrenal gland. Further, analysis of corticosterone pulse characteristics using the PULSAR algorithm (Merriam and Wachter, 1982) has shown that the pulse amplitude varies in a circadian manner, with low amplitudes in the morning and higher amplitudes in the evening (Windle et al., 1998a).

Our studies in the rat have shown a marked sexual diergism (Seale et al., 2004a, 2004b) and genetic variation (Windle et al., 1998a) in both the circadian and the ultradian pattern of corticosterone. Disruption of ultradian corticosterone dynamics has been also shown in a number of pathological states. For example, rats exposed to chronic inflammation have a hyperactive HPA axis, characterized by increased

**Fig. 1.** Ultradian rhythm of corticosterone in the rat. Under basal (unstressed) conditions, the dynamics of corticosterone secretion is characterized by both a circadian and an approximately hourly ultradian rhythm. In the rat, peak levels of corticosterone occur prior to the active dark phase (gray bar). The figure shows an individual corticosterone profile: blood samples were collected from a male Sprague Dawley adult rat every 10 min for 24 hours using an automated blood sampling system; corticosterone levels were measured by radio-immune assay.

corticosterone pulsatility throughout the 24-h cycle that results in flattening of the hormone circadian rhythm (Windle et al., 2001).

In addition to the rat, an ultradian rhythm of glucocorticoids has been reported in numerous species, including rhesus monkey (Holaday et al., 1977; Tapp et al., 1984), sheep (Fulkerson, 1978), and human (Henley et al., 2009a; Lewis et al., 2005; Weitzman et al., 1971).

The functional interaction between glucocorticoid pulsatility and the neuroendocrine and behavioral response to stress has been investigated in a number of studies. For example, in rats exposed to stress, the timing of the stressor relative to the phase of the underlying ultradian rhythm is crucial in determining the magnitude of the ACTH and corticosterone response to the stressor (Sarabdjitsingh et al., 2010; Windle et al., 1998a). This neuroendocrine response is also associated with a different behavioral response to the stressor, such as grooming, locomotion, and risk assessment, which are higher in rats that are stressed during the rising phase of corticosterone, compared to rats exposed to stress during the falling phase of the hormone pulse (Sarabdjitsingh et al., 2010). Furthermore, corticosterone pulsatility is also important for social behavior, as seen in resident rats that are more aggressive during the rising phase of a corticosterone than during the falling phase, when exposed to an intruder rat (Haller et al., 2000).

Ultradian rhythmicity of glucocorticoids in the plasma is paralleled by pulses of free hormone in the tissue, including subcutaneous tissue (Bhake et al., 2013; Qian et al., 2012) and saliva (Trifonova et al., 2013), and in the brain (Droste et al., 2008). Studies in vitro and in adrenalectomized rats, in which the endogenous hormone was replaced by either pulsatile or constant infusion of corticosterone, have shown that normal gene expression of glucocorticoid-target genes is only achieved with pulsatile corticosterone infusion, whereas the transcriptional response is disrupted when the tissue is exposed to constant glucocorticoid (Conway-Campbell et al., 2010; Stavreva et al., 2009). Indeed, ultradian corticosterone pulses are paralleled by rapid GR nuclear translocation (Conway-Campbell et al., 2007), cyclic GR binding to the DNA in the promoter sequences of glucocorticoid-responsive genes (e.g. Period (Per) 1) (Conway-Campbell et al., 2010; Stavreva et al., 2009), and by a rapid and transient increase in hnRNA for several GR-regulated genes. In contrast constant exposure to corticosterone is associated with a continuous increase in hnRNA and accumulation of higher levels of mature RNA (mRNA) and protein (Stavreva et al., 2009), which is consistent with data predicted by mathematical modeling of this system (Scheff et al., 2012). Interesting, this transient activation that is typical of normal ultradian rhythmic only occurs in response to the endogenous glucocorticoids such as corticosterone and hydrocortisone, whereas a single pulse of the synthetic glucocorticoid analog dexamethasone results in a prolonged GR activation profile (Stavreva et al., 2009). Pulsatile secretion of glucocorticoids is necessary to maintain a state of constant dynamic equilibration preventing down-regulation of signaling processes and/or abnormal prolonged activation of glucocorticoid responsive genes. It is therefore clear that abnormal constant exposure of glucocorticoids in target organs, as seen in several diseases in humans, and during treatment with long-lasting synthetic glucocorticoids, can have biological consequences such as glucocorticoid resistance and immune dysregulation.

Details of the importance of pulsatility for the genomic and non-genomic effects of glucocorticoids have been recently reviewed (Spiga et al., 2014). In this review article, we will focus on the mechanisms underlying the origin and regulation of pulsatility in the adrenal gland, and how these mechanisms become disrupted in disease and critical illness.

components of the HPA axis. Indeed, there have been a small number of studies, both in vitro and in vivo, demonstrating episodic release of CRH from macaque hypothalamic explants (Mershon et al., 1992), and rapid changes in CRH levels in the median eminence of freely-behaving rats (Ixart et al., 1991, 1994) and in the hypophyseal-portal circulation of the conscious sheep (Caraty et al., 1988; Engler et al., 1989). In addition to this, pulsatility of ACTH has been described in the rat (Carnes et al., 1986, 1988a, 1988b), sheep (Apostolakis et al., 1992), and human (Henley et al., 2009a).

### 2.2. The pituitary–adrenal pulse generator

While it is known that the circadian rhythm of glucocorticoids is regulated by the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the mechanisms generating the hormone ultradian rhythms are less clear. We have recently shown that the circadian rhythm of corticosterone is disrupted in rats with lesioned SCN or in rats exposed to constant light for 5 weeks, whereas the ultradian pulsatile pattern is maintained (Waite et al., 2012) in these rats suggesting that ultradian rhythm of corticosterone is generated independently of the SCN.

It is known that the HPA axis is regulated by both a positive feedforward drive – with CRH drive resulting in the rapid secretion of ACTH, and ACTH driving glucocorticoid release from the adrenal cortex – and a negative feedback inhibition – through which glucocorticoids secreted by the adrenal feedback on corticotroph cells of the anterior pituitary to inhibit ACTH release, and on hypothalamic CRH-secreting neurons to inhibit CRH release. In the rat, this feedforward–feedback loop is characterized by a short time delay in the pituitary–adrenal feed-forward pathway – where increase in ACTH is followed by a delayed increase in corticosterone (Carnes et al., 1989; Henley et al., 2009a) – presumably due to the time needed by the adrenal to de novo synthesize corticosterone (see the following section for more details). In addition to this, corticosterone can rapidly inhibit CRH-induced ACTH secretion from the anterior pituitary (Hinz and Hirschelmann, 2000; Jones et al., 1972, 1974; Mahmoud et al., 1984; Rotsztejn et al., 1975a, 1975b; Russell et al., 2010; Widmaier and Dallman, 1984) and CRH release from PVN neurons, via a mechanism that involves CORT-mediated both non-genomic and genomic processes.

Given the pulsatile nature of CRH release, for several decades it was thought that ultradian release of glucocorticoids was dependent on the hypothalamic CRH drive, and this was known as the “hypothalamic pulse generator” hypothesis. However, there are a number of findings that do not support this hypothesis. Firstly, there is a mismatch between the frequency of CRH pulses, and the frequency of ACTH and corticosterone oscillations, as in the rat CRH pulse frequency is higher (~3 pulses/h) (Ixart et al., 1991) than the near-hourly oscillation in ACTH (Carnes et al., 1988a) and corticosterone (Windle et al., 1998b). Furthermore, ultradian rhythms of ACTH and cortisol are maintained in sheep in which the hypothalamus has been surgically disconnected from the pituitary (Engler et al., 1990). Taken together, this evidence suggests that a central hypothalamic pulsatile drive is not required for pulsatile ACTH and glucocorticoid secretion.

The mechanism underlying the origin of glucocorticoid pulsatility has been further investigated in our group by using both mathematical modeling and in vivo experimental work. By using differential equations incorporating the magnitude of the CRH drive on the pituitary to induce ACTH release, the time taken for corticosterone to be synthesized and secreted by the adrenal gland, and the rapid glucocorticoid-mediated inhibition of ACTH secretion, Walker and colleagues have developed a mathematical model that describes the interaction between the pituitary and the adrenal gland (Walker et al., 2010). This model predicts that the pituitary–adrenal system can support self-sustained ACTH and corticosterone oscillations of a physiological ultradian frequency, even under conditions of constant CRH drive to the anterior pituitary. Specifically, the model predicts that hourly oscillations in ACTH and glucocorticoids can be generated for “intermediate” constant levels of CRH, comparable to those observed in basal unstressed conditions. These predictions are consistent with experimental data showing that ACTH is pulsatile in the rat (Carnes et al., 1988a, 1989), and that pulsatile ACTH is a critical factor in regulating pulsatile CORT secretion from the adrenal cortex (Spiga et al., 2011b). The model also predicts that these oscillations become “damped” for both low and higher levels of CRH, and this is again consistent with experimental data from the rat showing that a loss of pulsatile CORT secretion occurs both at the circadian nadir of HPA axis activity, when CRH drive is low, and following an acute stress response, when CRH is high (Windle et al., 1998b). We have tested the predictions of this hypothesis in vivo by studying the dynamics of ACTH and corticosterone in response to different levels of constant CRH stimulation in conscious freely behaving male rats (Walker et al., 2012). Consistent with the predictions of the mathematical model we found that a constant infusion of CRH can induce ultradian ACTH and corticosterone oscillations that persist throughout the infusion period – with corticosterone pulse amplitude and frequency similar to that of an endogenous pulse observed during the circadian peak of hormone release. In addition, the expected time delay between the pulse of ACTH and the pulse of corticosterone was also observed. Furthermore, constant infusion of a higher CRH concentration resulted in high and prolonged constant secretion of corticosterone, which is similar to the pattern of hormone release observed during a severe stress, such as administration of a bacterial endotoxin, a stimulus that is known to induce a robust increase in hypothalamic CRH secretion.

## 3. Adrenal regulation of glucocorticoid pulsatility

### 3.1. Adrenal glucocorticoid synthesis

Glucocorticoid hormones are lipophilic and therefore cannot be simply stored in vesicles, as it happens for peptidergic hormones such as CRH and ACTH, but they need to be newly synthesized in response to ACTH. Indeed, glucocorticoid synthesis in steroidogenic cells in the zona fasciculata of the adrenal cortex is initiated when ACTH binds to its specific cell surface G-protein-coupled receptor, the melanocortin type-2 receptor (MC2R) (Mountjoy et al., 1994). Upon ACTH binding, MC2R undergoes conformational changes leading to activation of adenylyl cyclase, with subsequent increase in intracellular levels of cyclic adenosine mono phosphate (cAMP), which, in turn, activates downstream signaling pathways including the protein kinase A (PKA) pathway.

Activation of PKA induces rapid synthesis of CORT via non-genomic mechanisms that involve post-transcriptional modification of steroidogenic proteins, including phosphorylation of hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL), a protein that increases the levels of intracellular cholesterol, the precursor of steroid hormones within the cell, and phosphorylation of StAR (Arakane et al., 1997), which facilitates the transport of cholesterol inside the mitochondria (Lin et al., 1995; Stocco and Clark, 1996), where a number of enzymatic reactions lead to glucocorticoid synthesis (Bush, 1953; Churchill and Kimura, 1979; Hum and Miller, 1993). Notably, mobilization of cholesterol and its transfer from the outer to the inner mitochondrial membrane are considered the rate-limiting steps in steroidogenesis. In parallel to non-genomic activation of these steroidogenic proteins, activation of the PKA signaling pathway also leads to transcriptional activation of a number of steroidogenic genes, including StAR. This process is mediated by PKA-mediated phosphorylation of the cAMP response element (CRE) binding protein (CREB) that facilitates its binding to promoter regions within steroidogenic gene targets.

The ability of CREB to induce StAR transcription is enhanced by the binding of CREB positive regulators, including the orphan nuclear receptors steroidogenic factor 1 (SF-1) ([Caron et al., 1997](https://doi.org/10.1038/ng0697-247); [Sugawara et al., 1996](https://doi.org/10.1038/ng0697-247)) and Nur77 ([Song et al., 2001](https://doi.org/10.1038/ng0697-247)). In contrast, the ability of SF-1 and Nur77 to enhance transcriptional activity of CREB is inhibited by the activity of the negative regulator DAX-1 (dose-sensitive sex reversal, adrenal hypoplasia congenita determining region on the X-chromosome-1) ([Crawford et al., 1998](https://doi.org/10.1038/ng0697-247)). Consistent with their positive and negative effects on StAR transcription, ACTH induces SF-1 and Nur77 expression and inhibits DAX-1 expression ([Gummow et al., 2006](https://doi.org/10.1038/ng0697-247); [Ragazzon et al., 2006](https://doi.org/10.1038/ng0697-247); [Song et al., 2004](https://doi.org/10.1038/ng0697-247); [Winney and Hammer, 2006](https://doi.org/10.1038/ng0697-247)). In addition to the regulatory effects of SF-1 and Nur77, CREB transcriptional activity requires another co-activator; transducer of CREB regulated activity-(TORC) 2, also called CREB regulated transcription co-activator (CRTC) ([Conkright et al., 2003](https://doi.org/10.1038/ng0697-247); [Iourgenko et al., 2003](https://doi.org/10.1038/ng0697-247); [Screaton et al., 2004](https://doi.org/10.1038/ng0697-247)). Upon ACTH stimulation of the adrenal, PKA-dependent phosphorylation of salt-inducible kinase (SIK) results in its inactivation, and this allows TORC2 dephosphorylation and its translocation to the nucleus where it regulates CREB-dependent transcription ([Takemori and Okamoto, 2008](https://doi.org/10.1038/ng0697-247); [Takemori et al., 2007](https://doi.org/10.1038/ng0697-247)).

### 3.2. Ultradian rhythms in the adrenal

Because pulsatile secretion of CORT is generated by pulses of ACTH, as shown by both mathematical modeling and experimental work ([Walker et al., 2010, 2012](https://doi.org/10.1038/ng0697-247)), this suggests that the adrenal must be adapted to respond rapidly to each pulse of ACTH to generate a pulse of CORT. Indeed, we have shown that in rats in which endogenous HPA activity has been suppressed by administration of the synthetic glucocorticoid methylprednisolone (MP), pulsatile infusion of ACTH results in pulsatile corticosterone secretion (Fig. 2A), with CORT pulse frequency and amplitude consistent to those observed in normal control rats, whereas an identical dose of ACTH infused at a constant rate has no effect on the adrenal, and no CORT is produced ([Spiga et al., 2011b](https://doi.org/10.1038/ng0697-247)). Furthermore, we found that in MP-suppressed rats infused with pulsatile ACTH corticosterone levels in response to a further infusion of a stress-like dose of ACTH is similar to that observed in unsuppressed rats, whereas it is remarkably reduced in MP-suppressed rats infused with constant pattern of ACTH (Fig. 2A). In addition to this, we also observed changes in steroidogenic gene mRNA levels, including StAR, CYP11A, the gene encoding for cholesterol side-chain cleavage cytochrome P450 ([Churchill and Kimura, 1979](https://doi.org/10.1038/ng0697-247)) – which catalyzes the cleavage of the cholesterol side chain to produce pregnenolone in the inner mitochondrial membrane – and the melanocortin receptor accessory protein (MRAP) – a protein that regulates the level and activity of MC2R at the cell surface, and thus the cell’s responsiveness to ACTH ([Metherell et al., 2005](https://doi.org/10.1038/ng0697-247)). StAR, CYP11A and MRAP mRNA were normal in rats infused with pulsatile ACTH, whereas a decrease was observed in rats infused with constant ACTH (Fig. 2B). These observations suggest that pulsatile ACTH at physiological levels is crucial for optimal adrenal responsiveness, presumably because pulsatile ACTH is necessary to maintain normal steroidogenic protein levels.

To further elucidate the mechanism underlying pulsatile CORT secretion in vivo, we investigated the dynamics of steroidogenic gene transcription in relationship to the dynamics of CORT secretion, over a detailed time-course following a single ultradian pulse of ACTH ([Spiga et al., 2011a](https://doi.org/10.1038/ng0697-247)) in the rat. Pulsatile corticosterone release, induced by a pulse of ACTH, is associated with pulsatile transcription of steroidogenic genes, as shown by rapid changes in the levels of StAR and CYP11A1 heteronuclear RNA (hnRNA), peaking 15 min after ACTH administration, and returning to basal levels within 30 min. A similar dynamic pattern of transcription was also observed for MRAP ([Liu et al., 2013](https://doi.org/10.1038/ng0697-247)). These dynamic transcriptional responses to a pulse of ACTH were associated with rapid and transient phosphorylation of

variation in steroidogenic protein levels may be the result of changes in the amplitude of pulsatile transcription thorough the 24-h cycle. In addition to StAR, several of its transcriptional regulators are also rhythmically expressed in the adrenal gland ([Park et al., 2013](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2013.01.005)), including SF-1 and Nur77 and DAX1. Consistent with their role in regulating the expression of adrenal StAR, SF-1 and Nur77 mRNA and protein levels are high during the hormonal circadian peak, whereas levels of expression of DAX1 are high during the circadian nadir. Given its inhibitory effect on StAR transcription, DAX-1 expression is presumably decreased in response to circadian ACTH increase, thus allowing for an increase in StAR expression, and therefore corticosterone production. Interestingly, disruption of corticosterone circadian rhythm in rats kept in constant light is also associated with a disrupted circadian rhythm of StAR and its transcriptional regulators ([Park et al., 2013](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2013.01.005)). Because disruption of the circadian rhythm corticosterone in these rats is the result of increased hormone pulsatility through the day, this suggests that pulsatile transcription of steroidogenic genes may be also disrupted in these rats.

### 3.3. Intra-adrenal negative feedback regulations

The activity of the HPA axis is tightly regulated by glucocorticoid activation of mineralocorticoid receptors (MR) and glucocorticoid receptors (GR). While the expression of MR is localized to specific tissues such as the kidney and limbic regions of the brain, GR is widely expressed through the body, and it is also expressed in the adrenal cortex of both the rat ([Loose et al., 1980](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0014-2999(80)80002-5)) and human ([Briassoulis et al., 2011](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2011.01.005)). The mechanisms by which glucocorticoids drive their negative feedback at the level of the hypothalamus and anterior pituitary have been well investigated. In contrast, whether adrenal GR can mediate inhibitory effect of endogenous glucocorticoids on their own synthesis via an intra-adrenal negative feedback is less clear. There is evidence suggesting that glucocorticoids can affect the steroidogenic pathway, and a number of in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that prior stimulation of the adrenal gland results in a decreased response to further stimuli. For example, adding high concentrations of corticosterone to the medium of cultured adrenal cells inhibits ACTH-stimulated corticosterone synthesis, and this effect can be seen within 1–2 hours of corticosterone exposure ([Carsia and Malamed, 1979](https://doi.org/10.1016/0014-2999(79)90005-5); [Peron et al., 1960](https://doi.org/10.1016/0014-2999(60)90005-5)). These findings are consistent with studies showing that in rats previously exposed to a stressor, or injected with a high concentration of ACTH, adrenal corticosterone is not increased in response to further stimuli, suggesting that glucocorticoid synthesis is dependent on the prior state within the adrenal of the rat ([Jones and Stockham, 1966](https://doi.org/10.1016/0014-2999(66)90005-5); [Langecker and Lurie, 1957](https://doi.org/10.1016/0014-2999(57)90005-5)). At a molecular level, an intra-adrenal GR-mediated negative feedback regulating steroidogenic gene expression has been described. StAR expression is regulated by the CREB co-activator SF-1 and inhibited by the co-repressor DAX-1. While ACTH induces SF-1 and represses DAX-1, glucocorticoids can induce DAX-1 transcription, by a mechanism that involves the formation of a SF-1/GR complex ([Gummow et al., 2006](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2006.01.005)). In addition to this, glucocorticoids can repress StAR transcription by a mechanism that involves GR binding to the nuclear receptor Nur77 ([Martin and Tremblay, 2008](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2008.01.005)). Interestingly, it has also been described that high levels of DAX-1 can enhance steroidogenic gene expression ([Xu et al., 2009](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2009.01.005)), and a recent study has shown that prolonged incubation with the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone can indeed increase both StAR transcription and cortisol production in the human adrenocortical cell line H295R ([Asser et al., 2014](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2014.01.005)). This suggests that pulsatile secretion of glucocorticoids is regulated by a fine balance between ACTH-mediated feedforward and glucocorticoid-mediated intra-adrenal feedback, but when glucocorticoid secretion is high, as seen during the stress response or in critical illness, this intra-adrenal regulatory mechanism may become disrupted.

The hypothesis of an intra-adrenal glucocorticoid-mediated negative feedback has been further investigated in our group. By integrating a mathematical model with in vivo experimental data we have recently provided evidence for the existence of intra-adrenal inhibition of glucocorticoid synthesis, and we have shown that this rapid intra-adrenal inhibition is an important factor regulating corticosterone synthesis over the timescales of both the basal ultradian rhythmicity of the HPA-axis and the rapid corticosterone response to stress ([Walker et al., 2015](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2015.01.005)). Our mathematical model predicts that pulsatile corticosterone secretion can modulate intra-adrenal corticosterone levels very rapidly (within 60 min), suggesting that, in addition to the genomic effects on StAR transcription described by [Gummow et al. (2006)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2006.01.005) and [Martin and Tremblay (2008)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2008.01.005), corticosterone can also regulate non-genomic mechanisms within the adrenal steroidogenic pathway that lead to rapid corticosterone synthesis.

### 4. Adrenal steroidogenesis and ultradian rhythm of glucocorticoids in critical illness

Pulsatile secretion of ACTH and cortisol has been observed in human, with a close temporal relationship between pulses of ACTH and cortisol, as found in the rat. Furthermore, a similar disruption of pulsatility has been reported in chronic illness. For example, patients affected by obstructive sleep apnea have increased cortisol pulse mass, and treatment of the condition results in a remission of these hormonal changes ([Henley et al., 2009b](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2009.01.005)). Maintenance of a normal ultradian rhythm of cortisol is also important in major surgery and critical illness ([Gibbison et al., 2013](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2013.01.005)). With this regard, we have recently shown that a disruption in cortisol secretion occurs in patients undergoing cardiac surgery, and dissociation between ACTH and cortisol is observed in these patients, with high cortisol levels despite normal ACTH ([Gibbison et al., 2015](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2015.01.005)). Notably, in our study, both hormones display a pulsatile pattern of secretion, suggesting that although the adrenal sensitivity to ACTH may be altered, the dynamics of adrenal steroidogenesis, as well as the negative feedback mechanisms at the levels of the pituitary, are maintained. Because there was a delayed between the beginning of the surgery and the onset of the ACTH response it is likely that the HPA axis response in these patients is secondary to factors other than the anesthesia and direct operative activity. Notably, the time of the ACTH response fits well with the increase in circulating inflammatory mediators (including TNF, IL-1 and IL-6) that also remain elevated for about 24 hours before returning to normal levels ([de Mendonca-Filho et al., 2006](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2006.01.005); [Lahat et al., 1992](https://doi.org/10.1016/0014-2999(92)90005-5); [Roth-Isigkeit et al., 1999](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0014-2999(99)00005-5)). Indeed, circulating cytokines can activate glucocorticoid secretion by acting directly on the adrenal ([Engstrom et al., 2008](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2008.01.005)) – where cytokine receptors are expressed – both by potentiating the effects of ACTH and by direct effect on steroidogenesis, through increased expression of steroidogenic genes including StAR. In addition, because several cytokines are also expressed in the adrenal gland in response to pathogens through activation of toll-like receptors, an immune-adrenal cross talk has also been suggested ([Judd et al., 2000](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0014-2999(00)00005-5); [Zacharowski et al., 2006](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2006.01.005)). Therefore, circulating and/or intra-adrenal cytokines may be responsible for the increased adrenal sensitivity observed in our clinical studies. To better elucidate the mechanisms leading to this ACTH-cortisol dissociation observed in our clinical studies in patients undergoing cardiac surgery, we used a rat model of acute critical illness (e.g. acute injection of lipopolysaccharide, LPS) ([Gibbison et al., 2015](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2015.01.005)). Similar to humans, following a rapid initial HPA axis activation, corticosterone levels in the blood remained high despite ACTH levels returning to normal within 4 hours of LPS administration ([Fig. 3A](#fig3a)). Remarkably, this increase in adrenal sensitivity was not observed in rats injected with a high dose of ACTH, as shown by corticosterone levels returning to basal levels shortly after the ACTH decline ([Fig. 3B](#fig3b)). The sustained

Administration of the bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 100 ng/i.v.) induces a robust increase in plasma ACTH and corticosterone in the rat. While ACTH levels returned rapidly to basal levels after the injection, a more prolonged effect on corticosterone was observed. (B) Time course of effect of ACTH on ACTH and corticosterone.

In contrast to the LPS injection, administration ACTH DEPOT induced a rapid and transient effect on both ACTH and corticosterone. (C) Increased adrenal responsiveness observed in LPS-treated rats was paralleled by elevated levels of steroidogenic protein mRNA, including StAR, CYP11A1 and MRAP. Adrenal glands from rats injected with either saline, LPS or ACTH depot were collected 6 hours after the injection, when corticosterone levels in LPS-treated rats are still high, despite normal levels of ACTH. Steroidogenic protein mRNA was measured by RT-qPCR. *P < 0.05 compared to saline-injected rats (Fisher's LSD post-hoc test; mean ± sem of n = 4–6/group). (D) The increase in StAR mRNA observed in LPS-treated rats was paralleled by an increase in StAR and a decrease in DAX-1. The figure shows a representative of n = 4–6/group. Proteins were measured by Western blot in whole cell extract from adrenal glands from rats injected with either saline, LPS or ACTH collected 6 hours after the injection. Data reproduced with modifications from Gibbison et al. (2015).

corticosterone increase observed in rats injected with LPS was paralleled by an elevated steroidogenic activity in the adrenal cortex, demonstrated by increased intra-adrenal corticosterone levels, and increased expression of StAR and MRAP mRNA (Fig. 3C), and StAR protein, that was associated with a dramatic decrease in DAX-1 protein expression (Fig. 3D). Consistent with the corticosterone data, these changes in adrenocortical steroidogenic proteins were not observed in rats injected with ACTH (Fig. 3C and D). Taken together our data show that robust changes in the adrenal steroidogenic pathway underlie the increase in adrenal sensitivity observed in our clinical and experimental study, and suggest that these changes may not be induced by the initial peak in ACTH that occurs after surgery (human) or LPS (rat), but inflammatory factors within the adrenal cortex may act to regulate corticosterone release. Our data fit well with a recent study showing elevated levels of cortisol in patients with sustained critical illness. Interestingly, these effects were more pronounced in patients with severe inflammation, in which high levels of cytokine were positively correlated with cortisol production (Boonen et al., 2013). A more recent study has shown that lower levels of ACTH observed in patients with prolonged critical illness, presumably due to increased negative feedback induced by elevated cortisol levels in these patients, are also associated with alterations in the adrenal. Indeed, post-mortem examination of adrenal tissue from these patients showed severe cholesterol depletion and a reduction in mRNA expression of ACTH-regulated steroidogenic genes, including MC2R and StAR (Boonen et al., 2014). These effects on adrenal gene expression are presumably the consequence of ACTH depletion in patients affected by prolonged illness, and are consistent with the adrenal alterations observed in mice lacking POMC, the gene that encodes for the precursor of ACTH (Karpac et al., 2008). All these observations suggest that while in acute critical illness associated with an inflammatory response, cytokines and other immune-modulators may be responsible for elevated level plasma glucocorticoids, as a consequence of increase hormone production, in prolonged critical illness, high plasma cortisol may be due to other mechanisms, such as reduced cortisol metabolism as suggested by Boonen et al. (2013).

### 5. Conclusions

The HPA axis is a highly dynamic system and ultradian rhythmicity is observed both at the level of hormone secretion (ACTH and glucocorticoids) and at the level of molecular mechanisms with the steroidogenic pathway in adrenocortical cells. Intra-adrenal negative feedback mechanisms regulate dynamic synthesis of glucocorticoids, and disruption of these dynamics during inflammation and critical illness contributes to changes in the normal ultradian and circadian pattern of hormone release. Since dynamic changes in glucocorticoid levels in tissue parallel those observed in plasma (Bhake et al., 2013; Droste et al., 2008; Qian et al., 2012), and pulsatile activation of the glucocorticoid receptor is crucial for normal gene transcription (Conway-Campbell et al., 2010; Stavreva et al., 2009), any disruptions to the glucocorticoid rhythm, as observed in disease state, will also be
