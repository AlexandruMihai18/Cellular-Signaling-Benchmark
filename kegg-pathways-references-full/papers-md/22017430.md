Summary: Nuclear-factor κB (NF-κB) transcription factors are activated by a wide variety of stimuli in diverse cell types and control key aspects of immune function and development. Receptor-mediated activation of NF-κB appears to occur through two distinct signaling pathways termed as the canonical and non-canonical NF-κB pathways. Although much work has demonstrated the physiological importance of non-canonical NF-κB signaling to immunity and its involvement in diverse pathologies, such as cancers and autoimmune disease, the architecture and regulation of the pathway is only beginning to be understood. The non-canonical pathway appears to be activated by a select set of receptors within the tumor necrosis factor superfamily, and we discuss the molecular mechanisms that connect ligation of these receptors to pathway activation. It has become increasingly clear that the key regulatory step of the pathway involves modulation of the post-translational degradation of NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK), the central activating kinase of non-canonical NF-κB signaling. How NIK post-translational stability is controlled before and after receptor ligation is an important aspect of understanding non-canonical NF-κB signaling. Furthermore, how release of NF-κB dimers downstream of the pathway’s activation is actually connected to its identified physiological and pathological roles is a key remaining question in the field.

Introduction  
Ligation of a wide variety of structurally diverse receptors, among them many members of the tumor necrosis factor superfamily receptors (TNFSFRs), results in activation of nuclear-factor κB (NF-κB) transcriptional dimers. Much work has been carried out to delineate the signaling pathways that connect receptor ligation to NF-κB dimer release. Over the past decade, it has become clear that two basic receptor-mediated pathways lead to liberation of NF-κB dimers, termed as the canonical and non-canonical NF-κB pathways, which display distinct kinetics and regulatory components. Although a wide variety of structurally diverse receptors initiate the canonical NF-κB pathway, only a subset of TNFSFRs appears to activate the non-canonical NF-κB pathway. These include

CD40, lymphotoxin β receptor (LTβR), B-cell activating factor receptor (BAFF-R), receptor activator of NF-κB (RANK), Fn14, and CD27 (1–6).

The ultimate functional output of non-canonical NF-κB signaling is the release of p52:RelB NF-κB dimers, which translocate with the nucleus and activate a presumably gene-specific transcriptional program (7). Over the past decade, the regulatory components connecting receptor ligation to p52:RelB release have been defined. The principal theme, which has emerged from the study of a wide variety of non-canonical pathway-activating receptors is the centrality of NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) in controlling signaling through the pathway (Fig. 1). NIK, a member of the mitogen-activating protein 3 (MAP3) kinases, is continuously synthesized but cannot be detected in resting cells due to constitutive degradation (8). Following receptor ligation, constitutive degradation of NIK is inhibited, allowing the protein to accumulate to detectable levels. This allows NIK to phosphorylate and activate the inhibitor of κB Kinase α (IKKα), thus initiating IKKα-mediated phosphorylation of p100, an NF-κB precursor protein. IKKα-mediated phosphorylation of residues in the p100 C-terminus results in partial p100 proteosomal digestion, releasing the p100 N-terminus, now known as p52, which in complex with RelB is then liberated to translocate to the nucleus (9, 10). Transactivation of genes by the RelB:p52 NF-κB dimer is then thought to initiate synthesis of a variety of proteins responsible for the functional outputs of the pathway. Over the past several years, our understanding of how NIK degradation is controlled before and after receptor ligation has substantially improved. We discuss these findings here along with the signaling, physiological, and pathological sequelae resulting from receptor-mediated stabilization of NIK.

### Basal NIK degradation

Control of NIK post-translational stability appears to be the central locus of non-canonical NF-κB signaling modulation. Therefore, how NIK stability is controlled has become one of the prime questions for those interested in this pathway’s regulation. Mounting evidence suggests that two TNF receptor-associated factors, TRAF2 and TRAF3, are critical for negative regulation of NIK. Genetic deletion of either protein results in basal accumulation of NIK in the absence of ligand and eliminates further receptor-induced stabilization. TRAF2 and TRAF3 appear to cooperatively coordinate basal NIK degradation, and their receptor-mediated inhibition likely represents the molecular switch that terminates NIK degradation following ligand binding (11, 12). Recent evidence has also pointed

Fig. 1. Non-canonical NF-κB pathway. In the basal state, to the left, a TRAF-cIAP complex catalyzes K48-linked ubiquitination of NIK, leading to constitutive NIK degradation; p100-containing complexes remain trapped in the cytoplasm. In the activated state, to the right, the TRAF-cIAP complex is recruited to the receptor upon ligand binding, whereupon TRAF2-mediated, K63-linked ubiquitination of cIAP1/2 switches its K48 ubiquitin ligase activity from NIK to TRAF3. The resultant TRAF3 degradation destabilizes the TRAF-cIAP complex, so allowing the accumulation of newly synthesized NIK. NIK then phosphorylates IKKα. Activated IKKα, in turn, phosphorylates and marks p100 for degradation, releasing p52:relB heterodimers for translocation to the nucleus. Activated IKKα also phosphorylates NIK, destabilizing it and limiting downstream activation events.
to an important role for the cellular inhibitors of apoptosis 1 and 2 (cIAP1/2) in basal NIK degradation. Pharmacological inhibition of these proteins or their combined deletion also allows for basal NIK accumulation in the absence of ligand (13–15).

Given the above evidence, it appears that TRAF2, TRAF3, and cIAP1/2 together participate in a single mechanism responsible for basal NIK degradation (Fig. 1). Most studies to date investigating the roles of these proteins have been carried out in fibroblasts or B cells, although it should be pointed out that non-canonical NF-κB signaling can be induced in a variety of other cell types and cell type-specific mechanisms for basal NIK degradation may exist. Whatever the case, one of the major recent questions in non-canonical NF-κB signaling has been understanding how TRAF2, TRAF3, and cIAP1/2 coordinate basal NIK degradation.

Because basal NIK degradation is sensitive to proteasome inhibitors, K48-linked ubiquitination has always been assumed to be the proximate signal targeting NIK for proteolysis (16). TRAF2, TRAF3, and cIAP1/2 all possess RING domains that display ubiquitin ligase activity, although the TRAF2 and TRAF3 RINGs appear to be specific for K63-linked ubiquitination, while cIAP1/2 can catalyze both K48- and K63-linked ubiquitin chains (17–23). Currently, it is believed that the ultimate NIK ubiquitin ligase is cIAP1/2, whereas TRAF2 and TRAF3 cooperate to recruit NIK to the cIAPs. Under conditions of cellular overexpression, cIAP-mediated K48-linked ubiquitination of NIK has been demonstrated although endogenous ubiquitination may never be observable given the difficulty of detecting endogenous NIK in unstimulated cells (11, 12).

That NIK is recruited to cIAPs via cooperative action of TRAF2 and TRAF3 is supported by the fact that NIK interacts with TRAF3, TRAF2 and TRAF3 heterodimerize, and that TRAF2 interacts with cIAP1/2. Therefore, TRAF2-TRAF3 heterodimers may act as the molecular bridge, which brings NIK together with cIAP1/2, the NIK K48-ubiquitin ligase (Fig. 1). Although it is currently not possible to interrogate this complex with endogenous levels of NIK in unstimulated cells, retrovirally overexpressed NIK has been shown co-precipitate with all members of what we will henceforth refer to as the TRAF-cIAP complex (11, 12).

However, certain observations suggest that TRAF2 and TRAF3 play a more intricate role within the TRAF-cIAP complex than merely as adapter proteins recruiting NIK to cIAP1/2. This is suggested by the fact that point mutants of TRAF3, which destroy the enzymatic functionality of its RING domain, cannot rescue the NIK hyperstability observed in

TRAF3-deficient fibroblasts (24). This raises the larger question of what the specific contribution of TRAF2 and TRAF3 are to the functionality of the TRAF-cIAP complex.

For several years, we have addressed these questions by generating chimeras of TRAF2, TRAF3, and TRAF5 and determining their ability to rescue the hyperactivity of non-canonical NF-κB signaling observed in TRAF2- or TRAF3-deficient fibroblasts. These studies have allowed us to dissect the individual contributions of these proteins to basal degradation of NIK. While enzymatic functionality of the TRAF3 RING domain appears critical, the specific identity of the RING domain does not, as chimeras which replace the TRAF2 or TRAF5 RING domain with that of TRAF3 are able to restore proper control of basal NIK degradation in TRAF3-deficient fibroblasts (11, 24). Indeed, based on these studies the major sequence-specific contribution of TRAF3 appears to be its TRAF domain, which interacts with a short TRAF3-binding motif in the N-terminus of NIK.

Receptor-proximal signaling events

TNFSF ligands exist in trimeric complexes and their binding to cognate receptor is thought to induce receptor trimerization. While membrane aggregation of receptors is believed to be the proximate molecular event which induces downstream signal activation, the mechanistic process by which receptor trimerization ultimately yields cytosolic signaling is still poorly understood for many TNFSFRs. In the case of TNFSFRs, which induce non-canonical NF-κB signaling, the primary question has revolved around how receptor ligation can inhibit the constitutive degradation of NIK, thus allowing NIK accumulation and downstream signaling.

A variety of TNFSFRs have been shown to induce non-canonical NF-κB signaling when ectopically overexpressed; however, given the possibility for artefactual findings with transient overexpression, it is important to evaluate whether induction of non-canonical NF-κB signaling has been demonstrated with endogenous levels of receptor (25). Demonstration of non-canonical NF-κB activation is most rigorously shown by observation of NIK accumulation following endogenous receptor ligation as well as p100-to-p52 processing. Additional experiments demonstrating that ligand-induced p100-to-p52 processing is NIK-dependent are extremely helpful.

The number of receptors that fit these criteria has increased over the past decade and now, includes CD40, BAFF-R, LTβR, RANK, FN14, and CD27 (1–6). Recently, it has been shown that TNFRs can induce non-canonical NF-κB signaling in cells deficient in RIP1 (26, 27). As the number of activatingreceptors has grown and increased in structural diversity, it has become clear that a simple, common mechanism for inducing non-canonical NF-κB signaling is unlikely to exist. Rather, it appears that these receptors use a range of molecular strategies to initiate a common, functional outcome of TRAF-cIAP complex destabilization. Receptor-induced destabilization of the TRAF-cIAP complex in turn liberates NIK from constitutive degradation and thus allows slow accumulation of the protein as it is translated. The molecular mechanisms by which receptor ligation leads to destabilization of the TRAF-cIAP complex has been most well-characterized for CD40 and LTβR, and we focus the majority of our discussion on these receptors.

Receptor ligation of CD40 appears to destabilize the TRAF-cIAP complex through degradation of TRAF2 and TRAF3. Interestingly, this degradation is proteasome dependent and appears to result from cIAP1/2-mediated K48-linked ubiquitination of TRAF3 and likely TRAF2. Consequently, receptor-induced re-orientation of cIAP1/2 ubiquitin ligase activity within the TRAF-cIAP complex from NIK to TRAF2 and TRAF3 may represent the molecular switch responsible for CD40-mediated activation of non-canonical NF-κB signaling. This re-orientation of cIAP1/2 ubiquitin ligase activity appears to require the TRAF2 RING domain, and it has been proposed that induction of TRAF2-mediated K63-linked ubiquitination of cIAP1/2 following receptor ligation may be responsible for this shift in the cIAP1/2 target (Fig. 1). It should be pointed out that much of the mechanistic work described here has been performed in transient over-expression studies, and their applicability to the physiological setting is naturally by extrapolation. However, it is clear that TRAF2 and TRAF3 are degraded by a proteasome- and cIAP1/2-dependent process following CD40-receptor ligation and that this degradation is correlated with a rise in NIK levels (11, 12).

Destabilization of the TRAF-cIAP complex following LTβR ligation appears to occur in two stages: an initial allosteric destabilization phase followed by a degradative destabilization phase. Careful mutational analyses have shown that a single structural groove in TRAF3 is responsible for interaction with both NIK and ligated LTβR. Equally, a single structural groove in TRAF2 is responsible for interaction with cIAP1/2 and ligated LTβR. Consequently, ligand binding to LTβR results in TRAF2 and TRAF3 recruitment to the receptor along with the displacement of cIAP1/2 and NIK. However, this initial purely allosteric destabilization of the TRAF-cIAP complex is followed by degradation of both TRAF2 and TRAF3. Whether receptor-mediated degradation of TRAF2 and TRAF3 is cIAP-dependent and occurs by an analogous process to that of CD40 is currently unclear (28).

Based on the above studies, it might be thought that direct, ligand-induced recruitment of TRAF2 and TRAF3 to receptor may be a structural prerequisite for activation of non-canonical NF-κB signaling. However, BAFF-R does not appear to possess the capacity to recruit TRAF2; conversely, CD27 does not appear to recruit TRAF3 following ligand binding (29, 30). In addition, TNFR, which was recently shown to activate the non-canonical pathway in RIP1-deficient cells, can only indirectly recruit TRAF2 through adapter molecules (26, 27). Finally, ubiquitin-dependent proteosomal degradation of TRAF2 and TRAF3 may not be the exclusive mechanism for receptor-induced TRAF-cIAP complex destabilization. Recently, it was shown that degradation TRAF2 and cIAP1 following Fn14 binding to its ligand TWEAK resulted from a non-proteosomal process that appeared to be dependent on functional lysosomes (31).

As our knowledge of non-canonical NF-κB pathway-activating receptors has become more refined, the commonalities between the mechanisms by which they induce signaling have become fewer. However, it appears that ligand binding to these receptors ultimately results in NIK accumulation through some method of molecular destabilization of the TRAF-cIAP complex.

The fact that TRAF-cIAP complex destabilization often occurs through degradation of TRAF2 or TRAF3 does raise certain questions regarding how receptor stimulation may affect other signaling pathways that depend on the presence of TRAF2 and TRAF3. For example, we have previously shown that TRAF3 is an important adapter in antiviral host defense that links both TLR and Rig-I-like receptor-dependent recognition of viral RNA to IRF3 activation and IFN-β production (32, 33). Therefore, one might hypothesize that sustained degradation of TRAF3 associated with long-term receptor ligation to affect antiviral host defense or other such pathways which depend on TRAF2 or TRAF3. Alternatively, it is possible that different functional pools of TRAF2 and TRAF3 exist such that degradation of the TRAF-cIAP complex may not affect other pathways. A comprehensive analysis of the biochemical impact of CD40 or LTβR ligation on the signaling of pathways dependent on TRAF2 or TRAF3 may be a helpful approach to address this question.

Although the vast majority of studies have focused on receptor-mediated activation of the non-canonical NF-κB pathway, a recent study has pointed out that transcriptional modulation of signaling components can also lead to the pathway’s activation. Herein, the authors found that release of microRNA-
mediated downregulation of IKKα transcripts during human primary monocyte differentiation to macrophages resulted in increased levels of IKKα and consequently increased p100-to-p52 processing. Possibly, because differentiated human macrophages possessed little TRAF2 protein, NIK displayed basal stability and could induce signaling through the non-canonical NF-κB pathway, even in receptor-unstimulated macrophages (34). This study brings up the larger point that most investigations into non-canonical NF-κB signaling have been carried out in murine cells or transformed human cells, which may not reflect the realities in primary human cells. Indeed, on several scattered occasions we have observed basal NIK stability in primary human cells, although we have not approached this question comprehensively. Consequently, we must be open to the possibility that regulation of non-canonical NF-κB signaling may occur by a different logic in primary human tissues and may not solely depend on receptor-induced modulation of NIK post-translational stability.

### Downstream signaling events

Whatever the modus operandi of any individual receptor in releasing NIK from constitutive degradation, the critical effect of receptor ligation appears to be the cellular accumulation of NIK. Given the current evidence, it seems that NIK activation purely requires the protein's accumulation and does not require other stimuli. It should be pointed out that NIK kinase activity is dependent on phosphorylation of particular residues in its activation loop; however, it is likely that these residues are either auto-phosphorylated within the context of accumulating NIK dimers or phosphorylated by some constitutive cellular kinase activity (35). This appears to be the case, given that overexpression of NIK or mere deletion TRAF-cIAP complex components is sufficient to activate the non-canonical NF-κB pathway.

Accumulated and activated NIK then phosphorylates and activates IKKα. In addition to this kinase-dependent function, NIK appears to recruit IKKα to p100 which IKKα then targets for phosphorylation (9). Early experiments initially showed that NIK can directly phosphorylate p100 and while this is likely the case when NIK is overexpressed, the connection of endogenous NIK to p100 phosphorylation appears to require IKKα (7, 36).

Phosphorylation of p100 by IKKα results in the recruitment of the SCF<sup>βTrCP</sup> ubiquitin ligase complex, which then targets p100 for K48-linked ubiquitination on a specific C-terminal lysine (37). Although in most cases K48-linked ubiquitination leads to the entire target protein being degraded by the proteasome, p100 ubiquitination results in partial proteolytic digestion of its C-terminus, thus releasing its N-terminus now known as p52. Mature p52, in complex with RelB, is then thought to translocate to the nucleus and initiate transcription of a specific gene program (10).

How and why proteosomal degradation is terminated at a specific residue within p100 is poorly understood. Several studies began to address this phenomenon over a decade ago and identified the importance of a glycine-rich region (GRR) in p100 directly upstream of the degradation termination site, which they suggested may interfere with continued movement of p100 into the proteasome (38). However, further investigation of this highly interesting hypothesis was sadly never continued. Furthermore, it is not known whether p100 ubiquitination exclusively leads to partial digestion or whether in some cases the entire protein is degraded. This distinction may be of importance given recent studies investigating the highly homologous NF-κB p50 precursor, p105, which also undergoes phosphorylation-dependent ubiquitination and partial proteolytic digestion. In certain instances p105 is completely degraded, although knowledge of the regulatory mechanisms and the significance of complete versus partial p105 degradation is still rudimentary (39, 40).

Early studies made much of the fact that p100 maturation to p52 following receptor stimulation appeared to require active translation and was inhibited by translation inhibitors such as cycloheximide. Consequently, many investigators hypothesized the p52 biogenesis from p100 occurred co-translationally (2, 41, 42). However, in light of the fact that signaling through the non-canonical NF-κB pathway requires fresh translation of NIK, the observation that cycloheximide inhibits p52 biogenesis is less surprising and confounds conclusions about the biochemical nature of p100 processing.

Degradation of the p100 C-terminus not only generates p52 but also eliminates the IκB-like functionality of p100 (Fig. 2). The p100 C-terminus contains a series of tandem ankyrin repeats and is structurally homologous to other IκB proteins. Recent work has shown that the p100 C-terminus, like other bona fide IκB proteins, is able to sequester NF-κB dimers in the cytosol and prevent their nuclear translocation. This is not only true of dimers of RelB and the preprocessed p100 N-terminus (p52) but also of NF-κB dimers such as p50:RelA, which are traditionally considered outputs of the canonical NF-κB pathway. Consequently, p100 processing and degradation of the p100 C-terminus downstream of non-canonical NF-κB signaling has been shown to yield p50:RelA release in fibroblasts and transactivation of canonical NF-κB target genes (43).

Fig. 2. Crosstalk between canonical and non-canonical NF-κB pathways. In the canonical pathway, to the left, TNFSR ligation activates the IKK complex, resulting in Ikβ phosphorylation and degradation, so releasing p50:relA heterodimers for translocation into the nucleus. In the non-canonical pathway, to the right, ligation of a subset of TNFRs allows for NIK accumulation. NIK phosphorylates IKKα, which in turn phosphorylates p100, resulting in its degradation and the release of p52:relB heterodimers. Activation of the non-canonical pathway can also lead to release of the 'canonical' p50:relA heterodimers. Similar to Ikβ proteins, p100 can bind to and sequester p50:relA heterodimers to the cytoplasm by virtue of C-terminal ankyrin repeats. The attendant p100 degradation that results from non-canonical pathway activation then releases these p50:relA heterodimers for translocation into the nucleus. Non-canonical pathway activation can also lead to p50:relA heterodimer release via direct NIK kinase activity. By phosphorylating the IKKα subunit, NIK can activate the IKK complex, so leading to Ikβ degradation and p50:relA release.

However, more direct routes of cross-talk between non-canonical and canonical NF-κB pathways appear to exist. It is of significance that nearly all TNFSFRs, which activate the non-canonical NF-κB pathway, also appear to stimulate kinase activity of the IKK complex, the central regulator of the canonical NF-κB pathway (Fig. 2). Although a comprehensive assessment has not been made, the capacity of some of these receptors to activate the IKK complex appears to depend on NIK, which may activate the IKK complex through phosphorylation of its IKKα subunit (5). In contrast, NIK-dependent activation of the non-canonical NF-κB pathway is thought to occur through phosphorylation of IKKα homodimers (7). Even so, one must be careful not to make broad conclusions as cellular context also seems to effect whether NIK is required for canonical NF-κB activation. For example, NIK appears to be required for canonical NF-κB signaling downstream of CD40 in B cells but not dendritic cells. Consequently, differences in the relative concentrations of signaling proteins within a cell may dictate the requirement of NIK for receptor-mediated stimulation of the canonical NF-κB pathway (44).

It should also be pointed out that receptor ligation generally leads to activation of canonical and non-canonical NF-κB signaling on different timescales. While IKK complex activation can be observed in less than an hour following receptor ligation, processing of p100 to p52 is observable only after 3–4 h (3, 36, 45–47). This is likely, because NIK requires at least 2–3 h for its accumulation to detectable levels following receptor ligation. Consequently, it is unclear how rapid activation of the canonical IKK complex can be NIK dependent, given the much slower kinetics of NIK accumulation. It is possible that a small pool of receptor-associated endogenous NIK exists that is sufficient to initiate rapid IKK complex activation, whereas p100 processing requires the much larger quantities achieved only after several hours of receptor ligation. However, empirical detection of such small receptor-associated quantities will likely be highly challenging, and such a role for NIK may ultimately have to rely on genetic evidence.

In addition to direct activation of the IKK complex by receptor ligation, accumulation of NIK to detectable levels can substantially enhance canonical NF-κB signaling by other TNFSFRs. For example, work in our laboratory has shown that high levels of endogenous NIK, either due to TRAF3 deficiency or long timescale LTβR activation, can substantially enhance TNFα-mediated induction of canonical NF-κB signaling. Again, this activity is NIK-dependent and seems to

involve the capacity of NIK to activate the IKK complex directly via phosphorylation of its IKKa subunit (48).

The conclusion from wide variety of studies detailing receptor downstream signaling events must be that activation and accumulation of NIK results in release of not only p52:RelB dimers but also dimers traditionally considered to part of the canonical NF-κB signaling pathway. Consequently, receptor ligation yields a long time course of NF-κB activity with different waves of dimer pairs being released at different time scales.

### Negative feedback

While much work has been focused on understanding how non-canonical NF-κB signaling is initiated and the molecular sequelae of the pathway's activation, our insight into mechanisms of negative feedback within the pathway has been limited. This stands in contrast to our awareness of negative feedback mechanisms in canonical NF-κB signaling, which are known to be multiple and serve to potently inhibit a wide variety of positive regulators of signaling following receptor ligation (49). Indeed, defects in canonical NF-κB negative feedback have been shown to yield proliferative disease (50).

Recent work in our laboratory has begun to shed light on how non-canonical NF-κB signaling is negatively regulated following receptor ligation. Our studies began with the observation that cells deficient in IKKa or possessing the alymphoplasmia (aly) point mutation of NIK, which ablates NIK-IKKa interaction, yield a hyperstable species of NIK. Although IKKa has been traditionally viewed as a downstream target of NIK, we found that activated IKKa directly phosphorylates NIK on particular residues in the NIK C-terminus. Phosphorylation at these residues results in NIK destabilization and thus serves to inhibit excessive accumulation of NIK following receptor ligation and thus hyperactivity of the non-canonical NF-κB pathway (51).

This IKKa-dependent negative regulation of NIK stability appeared to function independently of the TRAF-cIAP complex, which is destabilized following receptor stimulation. Therefore, it appears that two independent NIK degradative mechanisms exist: the TRAF-cIAP mechanism, which controls basal NIK levels in unstimulated cells, and the IKKa-dependent mechanism, which controls accumulating NIK levels in receptor-stimulated cells.

### Physiological outputs

The physiological roles of non-canonical NF-κB signaling have been largely gleaned from mice deficient in NIK or p100 as well as those possessing knockin mutations in IKKa, which render the protein’s kinase activity defective. Hyperactivity of the pathway has also been studied using mice deficient in TRAF2 and TRAF3, which die perinatally, although several tissue-specific knockout animals have been generated (52, 53). Given the fact that NIK activity and processing of p100 can enhance the release of canonical NF-κB dimers, it is challenging to dissect the individual contributions of canonical and non-canonical NF-κB pathways to the phenotypes observed in these mice.

Whatever the case, the phenotypes of NIK-deficient, NIK-aly, IKKa-knockin, and p100 mice share important phenotypic similarities that map onto features of mice deficient in CD40, BAFF-R, RANK, and LTβR, suggesting the relevance of non-canonical NF-κB signaling to the functions of these receptors (7, 54–62). The physiological roles of the non-canonical NF-κB pathway have been reviewed elsewhere, and we only briefly mention a few major themes. Defective non-canonical NF-κB signaling from the LTβR manifests as deficiencies in the development of secondary immune organs such as peripheral lymph nodes as well as more subtle architectural derangements of the spleen (59). Ablation of non-canonical NF-κB signaling from BAFF-R likely explains the reduced survival of peripheral B cells, whereas ablation of signaling from CD40 explains the inability of peripheral B cells to undergo isotype switching (58, 60–62). Although major defects in bone physiology have not been observed, ablation of non-canonical NF-κB signaling downstream of RANK appears to reduce the capacity of macrophages to differentiate into osteoclasts in vitro (58). However, non-canonical NF-κB signaling downstream RANK as well as CD40 appears to be critical for presentation of self-antigens by thymic epithelial cells, explaining why alymphoplasmia mice display increased incidence of autoimmune pathology (63).

A curious feature of the geography of our knowledge regarding the non-canonical NF-κB pathway is its concentration on both early biochemical events and late physiological outcomes, but little in the way of how signaling events are actually responsible for the functional outcomes observed on an in vivo scale. The underlying assumption of field has always been that gene transactivation by p52:RelB dimers is ultimately responsible for the functional cellular outputs of the non-canonical NF-κB pathway. However, the precise identity of these target genes has remained elusive. This is evidenced by the fact that most studies continue to use p100-to-p52 processing, in reality an intermediate signaling event, as the primary method of assessing successful activation of the non-canonical pathway.
The receptor for which the physiological contribution of non-canonical NF-κB signaling is best understood is LTβR. Interaction between LTβR and its ligand lymphotoxin are together responsible for early organization and development of secondary immune organs, such as peripheral lymph nodes and Peyer's patches (64). Herein, activation of LTβR on stromal 'organizer' cells induces transcription of a variety of adhesion molecules and chemokines, including VCAM1, ICAM1, MAdCAM1, CXCL12 (also known as SDF1), CCL21 (or SLC), CCL19 (or ELC), and CXCL13 (or BLC), which together help recruit hematopoietic precursor cells to the developing immune organ. Transcription of these chemokines appears to be the result of direct binding by p52:RelB dimers, thus providing a clear example of how activation of non-canonical NF-κB signaling can directly induce transactivation of genes critical for a demonstrated physiological function of the pathway (65).

However, other examples like that above are difficult to come by. BAFF-R-mediated activation of NF-κB signaling does result in the transactivation of Bcl2 in B cells that is dependent on both canonical and non-canonical pathways, possibly explaining the ability of the non-canonical NF-κB pathway to promote peripheral B-cell survival (1, 5, 66–68). Constitutive activation of p100 processing by NIKΔT3 leads to increased level of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-xL (67). However, constitutive p100 processing did not increase Bcl-2 levels, and it is still unknown whether RelB:p52 dimers are directly responsible for the transactivation of Bcl-xL.

To better understand the transactivational contribution of the non-canonical NF-κB pathway; recently, we assessed the profile of gene transcription following long-time course LTβR stimulation in fibroblasts. We chose to investigate gene transcription profiles at time points of 8 and 24 h following receptor ligation to reduce the contribution of early, canonical NF-κB dimers released by receptor stimulation. Out of nearly 19 000 genes profiled, only roughly 100 genes showed any consistent upregulation by LTβR stimulation at long timescales, although the vast majority was dependent on the presence of NIK (Razani B, Cheng G, unpublished data). Therefore, part of the challenge of identifying non-canonical NF-κB target genes may simply result from the fact that few exist. A similar result has also been observed in dendritic cells in which less than a 100 genes appear to be induced as a consequence of non-canonical NF-κB signaling downstream of CD40 ligation (69). Consequently, how non-canonical NF-κB signaling results in its profound biological effects will likely be one of the central questions of the field in the coming years.

### Pathological roles

Interest in non-canonical NF-κB signaling has always been fueled in part on the assumption of its importance in disease, and in recent years it has become increasingly clear that hyperactivity of this pathway is in indeed an important player in the etiopathogenesis of certain human proliferative and autoimmune pathologies. In these disease contexts, hyperactivation of non-canonical NF-κB signaling has in most cases been initiated by two basic mechanisms: defects in negative regulation of NIK or excessive receptor stimulation of cells.

Recent technological advances have allowed an unprecedented ability to screen cells for somatic mutations. The application of these approaches to cancer cells has revealed that mutations inactivating negative regulators of NIK stability are frequent causes of uncontrolled growth in hematologic cancers, such as multiple myeloma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and mucosal associated lymphoid tissue lymphomas (70–75). The inactivating genetic lesions identified have been diverse, affecting all the members of the TRAF-cIAP complex (cIAP1/2, TRAF2, and TRAF3) as well as mutations in NIK, which eliminate its capacity to interact with TRAF3. In some cases, the NIK gene has also been amplified, leading to a relative insufficiency of negative regulators in the face of excessive NIK synthesis. Such cancer cells reveal the exquisitely fine-tuned balance between NIK degradation and synthesis, which can be easily deranged even by a few fold more transcription of the NIK gene. In addition, excessive receptor stimulation of the non-canonical NF-κB pathway has been observed in some of these cancer samples due to hyperexpression of activating receptors, such as CD40, BAFF-R, or LTβR.

In many such cancer cells, hyperstability of NIK resulted in excessive activation of both the canonical and non-canonical NF-κB signaling pathways, likely due to NIK's capacity to directly activate the IKK complex (67). While hyperproliferation of such cells in culture was dependent on NIK, hyperproliferation was also dependent on activity of the IKK complex, suggesting that NIK-mediated activation of canonical NF-κB signaling played a major role in disease pathogenesis. Consequently, the capacity of NIK to initiate signaling through both NF-κB pathways may be a major reason why derangements of NIK stability display such a propensity to initiate proliferative disease.

Taking a step back, it has been instructive and humbling to note that after years of careful biochemical work detailing the individual components of the non-canonical NF-κB pathway,a widely cast screen of human patient samples could identify nearly every member. Naturally, the significance of these mutations could not have been appreciated without all of the previous studies; however, it also makes clear how comprehensive study of human disease samples can be incredibly informative in understanding signaling physiology.

Although the above studies have shown that absolute or relative defects in NIK negative regulation can result in uncontrolled growth of immune cells, especially B cells, it is likely that such derangements are not sufficient. For example, while mice possessing conditional deletions of TRAF2, TRAF3, or cIAP1/2 in B cells display increased numbers of peripheral B cells, they do not develop immune cell cancers within their lifetime (15, 76, 77). Therefore, it is clear that mere hyperactivity of the non-canonical NF-κB pathway cannot solely induce a cancerous phenotype, at least in B cells. It will be of interest to determine if derangements of specific other pathways are required in such cases that synergize with hyperactive non-canonical NF-κB signaling to reach the threshold of hyperproliferative disease.

In addition to cancer, non-canonical NF-κB signaling is thought to play a role in certain autoimmune diseases, possibly by allowing survival of autoreactive B cells. Significantly, increased plasma concentration of BAFF, which primarily activates the non-canonical NF-κB pathway in B cells, is often seen in patients with autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, and Sjögren’s syndrome (78–80). A mouse model, which transgenically expresses soluble BAFF from the liver generates significant autoimmune pathology in multiple tissues. Herein, disruption of the non-canonical NF-κB signaling pathway through a kinase inactivating mutation of IKKα leads to substantial reduction in autoimmune pathology, suggesting that hyperactivation of this pathway contributes to disease progression (81). Furthermore, mimicking the situation of rheumatoid arthritis, deletion of NIK significantly reduces pathology associated with a mouse model of inflammatory arthritis (82).

## Conclusions

Without doubt, interest in the non-canonical NF-κB signaling has waxed in the past several years and continues to grow in large part due to the recent appreciation of NIK’s role in the etiopathogenesis of a variety of important human diseases. This stands in contrast to the years following NIK’s cloning in which the kinase was initially heralded as a central regulator of canonical NF-κB signaling only to have interest wane after being found not essential to IKK complex activation downstream of TNFR ligation (83). However, abundant studies have now shown that NIK is a critical mediator of NF-κB signaling downstream of a variety of TNFSFRs and the central modulator of an alternative pathway to NF-κB dimer release now known as the non-canonical NF-κB pathway.

With an increasing number of TNFSFRs now recognized to activate non-canonical NF-κB signaling, a single molecular model for the pathway’s activation is unlikely. Instead, each receptor may employ a unique biochemical strategy to induce NIK stabilization, although in all cases studied thus far, accumulation of NIK has been the result of TRAF-cIAP complex destabilization. However, slower timescale modulation of the pathway may also occur through transcriptional changes of its signaling components, as observed in primary human monocyte differentiation into macrophages.

In the coming years, new components and regulatory mechanisms of non-canonical NF-κB signaling will undoubtedly be discovered. However, an important goal must be to understand how signaling through this pathway actually yields the physiological functions observed on an in vivo scale. With such an integrated understanding, we will be in an improved position to modulate non-canonical NF-κB signaling during contexts in which it plays a pathological role.
