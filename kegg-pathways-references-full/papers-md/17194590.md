Iron is an essential element for metabolic processes intrinsic to life, and yet the properties that make iron a necessity also make it potentially deleterious. To avoid harm, iron homeostasis is achieved through iron transport, storage and regulatory proteins. The functions of some of these molecules are well described, for example transferrin and transferrin receptor-1, whereas the roles of others, such as the transferrin homolog melanotransferrin, remain unclear. The past decade has seen the identification of new molecules involved in iron metabolism, such as divalent metal transporter-1, ferroportin-1, hepcidin, hemojuvelin and heme carrier protein-1. Here, we focus on these intriguing new molecules and the insights gained from them into cellular iron uptake and the regulation of iron metabolism.

### Introduction

Iron (Fe) is a crucible for life. It is essential for DNA synthesis, respiration and key metabolic reactions. The levels of iron in the cell must be delicately balanced, as iron loading leads to free radical damage by the Fenton reaction. The Fenton reaction occurs when excess iron reacts with oxygen to generate hydroxyl radicals. To achieve appropriate levels of cellular iron and to avoid iron-loading, transport, storage and regulatory proteins have evolved [1].

Our understanding of iron metabolism was built around its absorption in the duodenum followed by its delivery to tissues through the plasma iron transport protein transferrin (Tf). Transferrin binds to transferrin receptor-1 (TfR1) on the cell membrane and is internalized by receptor-mediated endocytosis [1]. Iron is then used for cellular processes, and excess iron is stored within the protein ferritin [1]. In this model, cellular iron levels are post-transcriptionally controlled by iron regulatory protein (IRP)-1 and IRP-2 [2,3]. When cells are iron-deficient, IRP-1 and IRP-2 bind to iron-responsive elements in the 3′- or 5′-untranslated regions of mRNA transcripts of molecules such as the TfR1 or ferritin, stabilizing them against degradation or inhibiting translation, respectively [2,3]. This results in increased cellular iron uptake through the TfR1 and decreased intracellular iron storage within ferritin, leading to elevated levels of intracellular iron.

This straightforward version of events has been overhauled in the last decade by the discovery of many new proteins that mediate iron transport and its metabolism (Box 1). The proteins ferroportin-1 (FPN1) [4], hepcidin [5–7], hemojuvelin (HJV) [8,9], transferrin receptor-2 (TfR2) [10] and hemochromatosis gene product (HFE) [11], have led to a large shift in our perception of iron homeostasis. Animal models have been crucial in discovering the roles of these molecules in iron homeostasis and disease (Table 1), whereas paradoxically the high-affinity iron-binding Tf homologs, lactoferrin (Lf) [12] and melanotransferrin (MTf) [13], previously thought to contribute to iron transport, might not have as significant a role [13,14] (Box 2).

The field of iron metabolism is large and diverse, with many new discoveries each year. Here, we identify key developments in our understanding of iron transport and metabolism. Throughout the article the reader is referred to review articles that cover in more detail the specialized areas that we cannot cover here owing to the complexity of the field. We concentrate our attention on the new mechanisms that tightly regulate iron absorption, cellular uptake and release, and on the control of iron homeostasis through the hormone hepcidin. These exciting recent developments provide greater insight into the role of this essential element in normal physiology and disease.

#### Cellular iron metabolism

The cellular metabolism of iron encompasses its absorption, regulation and utilization for cellular processes. In this section we first examine the dietary absorption of iron in the intestine, followed by its uptake by tissues such as erythroid cells and its utilization within the mitochondrion.

##### Overview of dietary iron uptake

In mammals, the majority of iron is present as hemoglobin in erythrocytes. Senescent erythrocytes are phagocytosed by macrophages and a significant portion of the iron is efficiently recycled [15]. However, there is some daily loss of iron that must be compensated for by dietary absorption through duodenal enterocytes [1] (Figure 1a). Iron exists in two main forms, Fe(III) (the ferric form) and Fe(II) (the ferrous form). Before absorption, Fe(III) in the diet must be reduced to Fe(II) at the apical surface of enterocytes, a role that was once attributed to the ferrireductase duodenal cytochrome-b (Dcytb) [16]. However, ablation of the murine Dcytb homolog Cybrd1 results in no iron-deficient phenotype, suggesting that Dcytb is not essential for dietary iron uptake in the mouse and that another ferrireductase remains to be discovered [16]. Once in the ferrous state, Fe(II) is transported into the cell by divalent metal

Box 2. Transferrin homologs: crucial for iron transport?

Transferrin is the primary iron transport protein in the serum that reversibly binds iron with high affinity [1]. Lactoferrin (Lf) and melanotransferrin (MTf) are Tf homologs that share ~37-39% overall sequence similarity with Tf, in addition to highly conserved disulfide bonds and iron-ligating residues [65]. Lf is found predominantly in breast milk and other bodily secretions and is believed to be important for iron absorption in the neonate and for general immunity. It participates in the iron-depletion pathway and anti-bacterial effector system of the innate immune system [12]. Unlike Tf and Lf, MTf is typically membrane-bound by a GPI anchor and binds only one atom of iron in its N-terminus.

The expression pattern of MTf is different from that of other molecules involved in iron metabolism; it is highly expressed on melanoma cells and at lower levels in the salivary gland, pancreas, kidney and testis [65,66]. Its iron-binding capability and its high expression on melanoma cells suggest that MTf assists tumor cells with their increased iron requirements. It has also been suggested that MTf transcytoses the blood brain barrier to deliver iron efficiently [67]. However, examination of cellular iron uptake *in vitro* in melanoma cells and *in vivo* in rat and mice brain, liver and spleen shows that MTf does not have a significant role in cellular iron internalization [65,14].

Recently, phenotypic characterization of Lf and MTf knockout mouse models has shown that Tf homologs have no unique role in cellular iron metabolism [12,13]. As no molecular studies have been published on the Lf knockout mouse, it cannot be ruled out that there is redundancy or compensation by other molecules that transport iron, such as Tf. Furthermore, a phenotype might become apparent only when these animals are exposed to an appropriate stress, such as an immunological challenge by injection of bacteria or tumor cells. However, the absence of an iron-related phenotype in the MTf knockout mouse is supported by whole-genome microarray studies, which showed no change in the expression of genes associated with iron metabolism [14].

This microarray study and another performed on MTf down-regulated melanoma cells suggest that MTf has an important role in cellular proliferation and migration. These functions seem to be independent of cellular iron metabolism [14], indicating MTf does not increase proliferation by providing cells with more iron. A role for MTf in cell proliferation and melanoma tumorigenesis is further supported by recent studies implicating MTf not only in these processes, but also in plasminogen activation [68,69] and angiogenesis [70]. In these investigations, the addition of a truncated soluble form of MTf (sMTf) modulated plasminogen activation, which in turn influenced cell migration and angiogenesis [68–70]. However, sMTf is found only at very low concentrations physiologically, and further studies on both forms of MTf are required. The challenge ahead is to test the veracity of these hypotheses and elucidate the molecular roles of MTf. Nonetheless, the lack of an obvious phenotype in the Lf and MTf knockout mice shows that protein function should not be assumed on the basis of structural similarities to close homologs.

transporter-1 (DMT1), an energy-dependent symporter that also transports protons. Animal models have shown that although DMT1 is not essential for maternal iron transfer across the placenta to the fetus, it is a requirement for intestinal uptake of inorganic sources of dietary iron [17–19].

Another source of dietary iron is heme, a molecule that consists of a protoporphyrin ring that binds iron. Heme results from the breakdown of hemoglobin and myoglobin found in meat products, and it is thought to be internalized through the recently identified receptor heme carrier protein-1 (HCP1) [20]. HCP1 is expressed at high levels in the duodenum [20] (Figure 1a) and, upon binding of heme to HCP1 on the cell surface, the complex is internalized by receptor-mediated endocytosis. It is suggested that the resultant endosomal vesicles migrate to the endoplasmic reticulum, where iron is liberated from heme by the heme oxygenase-1 (HO1) that is found on the reticulum surface. Studies with this receptor demonstrated that heme transport is post-transcriptionally regulated by iron stores, [20] although the exact mechanism is as yet unclear. In fact, HCP1 becomes localized to the apical membrane during iron depletion, whereas in iron-replete mice the protein is found intracellularly in endosomal vesicles [20].

Iron liberated from heme or imported into the enterocyte by DMT1 then enters the hypothesized intracellular or ‘labile’ iron pool. The molecular character of this pool in enterocytes remains unknown, but it could consist of low molecular weight chelates or chaperone proteins that bind and transport iron [21]. Iron is delivered to the basolateral membrane, although the proteins, cellular compartments or mechanisms that convey the iron remain unknown. The Fe(II) is then exported through the basolateral membrane of the enterocyte to the interstitial space by the exporter FPN1 [4] and oxidized by the ferroxidase hephaestin (Hp) [22,23]. Ferroportin-1 is negatively regulated by the iron-regulatory hormone hepcidin. Hepcidin has been shown to bind FPN1 resulting in internalization and degradation of FPN1 [24]. In fact, FPN1 is crucial for cellular iron export and is the only known mechanism of iron efflux as demonstrated in transgenic mice: deletion of FPN1 is embryonically lethal whereas inactivation of FPN1 by a conditional knockout results in increased iron storage in enterocytes, macrophages and hepatocytes [4]. Once extracellular, iron is then bound with

Figure 1. Cellular iron uptake and metabolism. (a) Dietary iron uptake. Non-heme dietary iron is taken up in the enterocytes of the duodenum after Fe(III) is reduced to Fe(II) by a ferrireductase enzyme, one candidate for this protein is duodenal cytochrome-b (Dcytb). After reduction of Fe(III) to Fe(II) this ion is then transported into the cytosol by divalent metal transporter-1 (DMT1). Dietary heme is probably transported across the membrane by the heme carrier protein-1 (HCP1) and internalized. The Fe(II) in heme is liberated by heme oxygenase-1 (HO1). In enterocytes the Fe(II) can enter the putative cytosolic compartment, the labile iron pool (LIP). Iron(II) is subsequently exported through the basolateral membrane of the enterocyte by ferroportin-1 (FPN1). The Fe(III) can then be oxidized by hephaestin (Hp) before it is bound by transferrin (Tf) and transported through the circulation. (b) Erythroid iron uptake. Transferrin-bound iron binds to the transferrin receptor-1 (TfR1) on erythroid cells. The Tf-TfR1 complex is internalized, and a decrease in endosomal pH (H⁺) releases iron from Tf. In reticulocytes, the iron can be reduced by six-transmembrane epithelial antigen of the prostate-3 (Steap3) and exported from the endosome by DMT1. The Sec15l1 protein is predicted to assist Tf cycling and possibly vesicle docking for direct delivery of iron to the mitochondrion. (c) Mitochondrial iron metabolism. A mitochondrial iron importer, such as mitoferrin, transports iron into the mitochondrion. Ferrochelatase synthesizes heme from Fe(II) and protoporphyrin IX (PIX). The iron is also used for [Fe–S] cluster synthesis or potentially stored in mitochondrial ferritin. The [Fe–S] clusters can be exported from the mitochondria by ABCB7. Heme is probably exported from the mitochondrion by a transporter, with several candidates being known: the breast cancer resistance protein ABCG2, the feline leukemia virus subgroup-C receptor (FLVCR) and the ABC-me transporter. It has been proposed that frataxin acts as a metabolic switch between [Fe–S] cluster and heme synthesis.

product is part of the mammalian exocyst complex and, in addition to cycling of Tf-containing endosomes, it is hypothesized to dock endosomal vesicles to the mitochondrion, enabling direct delivery of iron to this organelle [28] (Figure 1b). However, whether there is less iron within the mitochondria of reticulocytes in *hbd* mice remains to be investigated. This suggestion of direct delivery would be consistent with studies in reticulocytes indicating that iron is directly transported from protein to protein and/or from compartment to compartment and not left unbound in the cytosol as low molecular weight complexes of a labile iron pool [21]. Although these two studies [26,27] question the significance of a labile iron pool in erythroid cells, we cannot rule out the possibility that this cellular compartment exists in other cell types, such as hepatocytes, enterocytes and macrophages.

### Mitochondrial iron metabolism

Mitochondria are crucial to iron metabolism, being the unique site for heme synthesis and the major site for iron–sulfur ([Fe–S]) cluster biosynthesis [1] (Figure 1c). In murine erythroblasts it is suggested that iron is transported into the mitochondrion by the recently characterized iron transporter mitoferrin [29]. Murine mitoferrin is a homolog of the zebrafish protein frascati and the yeast proteins MRS3 and MRS4 [29]. Mutation of murine mitoferrin and zebrafish frascati results in impaired heme synthesis due to defects in mitochondrial iron uptake [29,30], whereas mutation of MRS3 and MRS4 also leads to impaired [Fe–S] cluster and heme biosynthesis [31]. However, as mutation of these mitoferrin homologs does not result in a deleterious phenotype, we cannot rule out the presence of other unidentified mitochondrial iron transporters.

Once iron is transported across the mitochondrial membrane, it can be used for a variety of metabolic processes, in particular heme and [Fe–S] synthesis (Figure 1c). Heme is then transported out of the mitochondrion for insertion into protein, such as cytochromes. However, the heme transporters(s) responsible for heme release remain unclear. Three molecules have been identified as possible mitochondrial heme exporters or transporters: the breast cancer resistance protein (ABCG2) [32], the ABC-mitochondrial erythroid (ABC-me) transporter [33] and the feline leukemia virus subgroup C receptor (FLVCR) [34]. The ABCG2 and ABC-me transporters are members of the ATP-binding cassette superfamily of membrane transporters, belonging to the G and B subfamilies, respectively, and are believed to be important for the trafficking of heme. In mice, ablation of ABCG2 leads to accumulation of the heme synthesis intermediate, protoporphyrin IX (PIX) [32], strongly suggesting a role for ABCG2 in heme export from the mitochondrion. ABC-me is also suggested to traffic heme and heme intermediates across the mitochondrial membrane [33]. FLVCR could be required for differentiation of erythroid precursors into colony forming units, potentially protecting cells against heme toxicity by exporting excess heme [34] that can otherwise result in oxidative stress. However, the exact molecular mechanism and contribution of ABC-me and FLVCR to heme transport in the mitochondrion remain to be determined.

It was previously hypothesized that the inner mitochondrial protein frataxin regulates mitochondrial iron utilization, acting as a metabolic switch between heme synthesis and the genesis of [Fe–S] clusters [35] (Figure 1c). Frataxin expression is much decreased in the disease Friedreich’s ataxia, in which iron loading occurs in the mitochondrion [36,37]. However, the molecular form of this excess iron remains unknown, but it could be unbound iron or iron stored in mitochondrial ferritin or other proteins. Mitochondrial ferritin is responsible for storing iron within the mitochondrion and its expression is increased in patients with X-linked sideroblastic anemia [38]. Other mutations have also been associated with impaired mitochondrial iron trafficking. For instance, in X-linked sideroblastic anemia with ataxia, a mutation in the membrane transporter ABCB7 [39] results in the impaired transfer of [Fe–S] clusters from the mitochondrion to the cytoplasm. Accumulation of iron within the mitochondria of neural cells of patients affected by this disease eventually leads to cellular deterioration and death, resulting in progressive ataxia [39].

### New perceptions of iron homeostasis

A new picture of iron homeostasis has resulted from the identification of hepcidin, the hormone and negative regulator of iron metabolism [5–7], and the proteins that can be mutated in hemochromatosis, HJV [8,9], TfR2 [10] and HFE [11], that affect hepcidin expression and thereby indirectly regulate iron metabolism (Box 2; Table 1). Increasing awareness of the intimate relationships between these molecules has overhauled our perception of iron homeostasis and is enhancing our understanding of its involvement in inflammation, immunity, erythropoiesis and hypoxia. These new molecules build an intricate signaling network to control iron homeostasis (Figure 2).

Hepcidin is an antimicrobial peptide and mediator of innate immunity that is expressed predominantly in the liver [40]. The serendipitous discovery that the USF knockout mouse (the USF gene is located upstream of hepcidin) has a phenotype of iron overload first showed the significance of hepcidin to iron metabolism [6]. By contrast, transgenic mice that overexpress hepcidin develop severe anemia [7]. Hepcidin controls iron levels by interacting directly with FPN1, resulting in internalization and degradation of FPN1 when iron levels are high [24,41]. This mechanism therefore blocks the release of iron from macrophages, hepatocytes and enterocytes [15,24,42]. Preliminary experiments indicate that duodenal DMT1 and Dcytb are also negatively regulated by hepcidin, although

**Figure 2.** Iron homeostasis. When iron levels are high, molecules such as the hemochromatosis gene product (HFE), hemojuvelin (HJV) and transferrin receptor 2 (TfR2) increase hepatic hepcidin expression. HJV is proposed to act as a co-receptor for BMP ligands and BMP receptors (BMP-R). Upon binding to HJV, the ligand and two BMP-Rs on the cell surface, the intracellular BMP signaling pathway is activated. This in turn activates the SMAD signaling pathway to induce hepcidin expression. However, the pathway by which HFE and TfR2 induce hepcidin expression is unclear. It is suggested that HJV and soluble HJV (sHJV) modulates hepcidin expression through activating bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling. Infection and inflammation can result in cytokines, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) stimulating hepcidin expression through molecular pathways that could include binding of STAT3 to the hepcidin promoter. Hepcidin then binds to ferroportin-1 (FPN1) on the surface of macrophages, enterocytes and hepatocytes. The complex is then internalized and degraded, decreasing iron release from macrophages and hepatocytes and reducing intestinal iron uptake. It is suggested that hepcidin also decreases expression of proteins involved in intestinal iron absorption, such as duodenal cytochrome-b (Dcytb) and divalent metal transporter-1 (DMT1), although the mechanism and extent of control is unknown. By contrast, increased erythropoietic activity suppresses hepcidin expression, as do anemia and hypoxia. How these three processes inhibit hepcidin expression is unclear, but they are closely related. Solid lines indicate a demonstrated pathway; dashed lines indicate an unknown mechanism.
whether there is a direct or indirect interaction between hepcidin and these transporters remains to be explored [43,44]. The appropriate regulation of hepcidin by upstream regulators is therefore essential, as overexpression can lead to iron-deficiency anemia whereas downregulation can result in iron overload.

The expression of hepcidin is regulated in part through HJV, TfR2 and HFE. Mutations in these molecules and β₂-microglobulin [45], which interacts with HFE on the cell surface, lead to a phenotype of hemochromatosis, in which hepcidin expression is either decreased or unresponsive to dietary iron loading [9,10,45]. Furthermore, this suggests that the expression of hepcidin is regulated by iron levels indirectly through these four proteins, although we are only beginning to understand how this is achieved.

It has been proposed that HJV, a member of the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) co-receptor family, uses the BMP signaling pathway to up-regulate hepcidin expression [46] (Figure 2). As investigated in the mouse, it is proposed that HJV acts as a co-receptor that binds to BMP ligands (for example BMP2) and BMP type 1 or BMP type 2 receptors on the cell surface. This complex (HJV–BMP2–BMP-receptor) then induces an intracellular BMP signaling cascade. This in turn activates the SMAD4 signaling pathway to directly increase hepcidin gene expression [46]. Indeed, mice whose hepatocytes are deficient in SMAD4 have reduced hepcidin expression and a phenotype of iron overload [47]. However, this pathway is not used by HFE or TfR2 [48] and the mechanism of action of these upstream regulators is unclear.

HJV is typically membrane-bound by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor, although a soluble (sHJV) form does exist [49]. It is hypothesized that sHJV competes with membrane-bound HJV for BMP receptor binding on the cell surface, resulting in sHJV inhibiting the signaling cascade that induces hepcidin expression [49]. These studies were performed *in vitro* on primary human hepatocytes using recombinant sHJV at levels similar to those present physiologically in human sera [49]. These preliminary findings require further investigation, as understanding how these molecules modulate each other might provide important insights into many iron-overload diseases.

Emerging evidence suggests that erythropoiesis mediates hepcidin expression, with increased erythropoietic activity suppressing the action of hepcidin [50–53]. This in turn facilitates export of iron from the reticuloendothelial system and enterocytes, increasing the availability of iron for erythropoiesis [52]. Anemia and hypoxia also suppress hepcidin expression, although recent experiments indicate that functional erythropoiesis is required [52,53] for these conditions to regulate hepcidin expression, and exactly how erythropoietic activity interfaces with hepcidin expression is unknown. Indeed, how the iron status and requirements of the body are communicated is also unclear. There is evidence to support the hypothesis that plasma diferric Tf levels are an indicator of these iron stores and requirements, although exactly how they modulate hepcidin expression is unclear [54].

As previously mentioned, the inappropriate expression of hepcidin has wide-reaching consequences in the anemia

of chronic disease associated with malignancy, infection and inflammation (reviewed in Ref. [55]). With regard to inflammation and infection, cytokines, in particular interleukin (IL)-6, can induce hepcidin expression in macrophages and neutrophils in response to infection and inflammation in a manner reminiscent of the Toll-like receptor 4 pathway [56]. This inflammatory response bypasses the known upstream regulators of hepcidin and overrides the iron-sensing pathway to directly increase hepcidin expression, thereby reducing iron bioavailability for this process [55]. A recent study proposes a model in which IL6 induces expression of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) molecule that in turn binds the hepcidin promoter [57]. Taken together, the multifactorial regulation of hepcidin and its downstream effects are revolutionizing our understanding of iron metabolism and homeostasis.

Iron: a novel role in apoptosis?

The misregulation of iron metabolism can have disastrous effects for cells. Recent evidence from studies with lipocalin suggests that its iron-binding properties regulate apoptosis. Lipocalins are components of neutrophil granules that participate in the iron-depletion strategy of the innate immune system, which limits bacterial growth [58]. The murine lipocalin 24p3 can induce leukocyte apoptosis and also bind bacterial siderophores [58]. In fact, mice deficient in 24p3 develop bacteremia (bacteria in the bloodstream) more easily than their wild-type counterparts [59] (Table 1).

Recently, a receptor that internalizes 24p3 has been reported, 24p3R [60], and this has led to the formulation of a model of apoptosis through iron sequestration. In this model it is proposed that internalization of the apo form of 24p3 (the form that does not contain iron) leads to iron efflux. In this way, apo-24p3 might sequester intracellular iron when it enters the cell through the receptor 24p3R and then removes iron when it exits the cell. The source of this cellular iron could be an as-yet unidentified mammalian siderophore [60]. This net iron loss could lead to apoptosis through the pro-apoptotic Bim signaling pathway. Conversely, internalization of siderophore-iron bound to 24p3 might prevent apoptosis [60]. Unfortunately, this study [60] used 24p3 loaded with a bacterial siderophore and its physiological relevance is therefore questionable [58]. However, it is possible that 24p3 acts as a clearance mechanism after binding bacterial siderophores that are then internalized by immune effector cells expressing 24p3R [58]. Furthermore, studies with the human homolog NGAL give a conflicting result, that the protein is not involved in apoptosis in myeloid cells [58,61]. Although internalization of 24p3 and its receptor could represent a novel iron-uptake pathway or a signaling mechanism to regulate immune cell survival, serious questions remain about its physiological significance [58,61].

hormone of iron metabolism, hepcidin, has been crucial in increasing our understanding. In addition, animal models have given invaluable insights into these molecules and how the body maintains its homeostatic control. Although these discoveries have had wide-reaching effects throughout the field, some intriguing questions remain (Box 3). Further investigation needs to address these questions so that integration of this new knowledge can be made into a complete picture of iron metabolism and homeostasis.

Free journals for developing countries

The WHO and six medical journal publishers have launched the Health InterNetwork Access to Research Initiative, which enables nearly 70 of the world’s poorest countries to gain free access to biomedical literature through the internet.

The science publishers, Blackwell, Elsevier, Harcourt Worldwide STM group, Wolters Kluwer International Health and Science, Springer-Verlag and John Wiley, were approached by the WHO and the British Medical Journal in 2001. Initially, more than 1500 journals were made available for free or at significantly reduced prices to universities, medical schools, and research and public institutions in developing countries. In 2002, 22 additional publishers joined, and more than 2000 journals are now available. Currently more than 70 publishers are participating in the program.

Gro Harlem Brundtland, the former director-general of the WHO, said that this initiative was “perhaps the biggest step ever taken towards reducing the health information gap between rich and poor countries”.
