## Summary

Understanding the molecular strategies used by *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* to invade and persist within the host is of paramount importance to tackle the tuberculosis pandemic. Comparative genomic surveys have revealed that *hadC*, encoding a subunit of the HadBC dehydratase, is mutated in the avirulent *M. tuberculosis* H37Ra strain. We show here that mutation or deletion of *hadC* affects the biosynthesis of oxygenated mycolic acids, substantially reducing their production level. Additionally, it causes the loss of atypical extra-long mycolic acids, demonstrating the involvement of HadBC in the late elongation steps of mycolic acid biosynthesis. These events have an impact on the morphotype, cording capacity and biofilm growth of the bacilli as well as on their sensitivity to agents such as rifampicin. Furthermore, deletion of *hadC* leads to a dramatic loss of virulence: an almost 4-log drop of the bacterial load in the lungs and spleens of infected immunodeficient mice. Both its unique function and importance for *M. tuberculosis*

## Introduction

The envelope of the tubercle bacillus forms a thick and highly impermeable coat, exceptionally rich in exotic lipids, which play pivotal roles in pathogenicity (Daffé and Draper, 1998; Verschoor *et al.*, 2012) and make this agent of tuberculosis (TB) particularly resistant against the host immune system and common antibiotics. Despite recent progress in the elucidation of pathogenicity mechanisms, TB remains a major health problem worldwide with 9 million active TB cases and 1.5 million deaths in 2013 (WHO, 2014). The emergence of multidrug-resistant *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* (*Mtb*) strains severely compromises conventional TB chemotherapy (WHO, 2014). Against this background, it appears important to clarify the molecular bases of infection by this pathogen.

In the 1930s, the *Mtb* patient isolate H37 was dissociated into an avirulent variant, H37Ra, and a virulent variant, H37Rv, by serial passages on different media (Steenken *et al.*, 1934; Steenken and Gardner, 1946). Strain *Mtb* H37Ra displays a distinct colony morphology and does not form the characteristic cords usually observed for *Mtb* (Middlebrook *et al.*, 1947). It is infectious but does not replicate in macrophages (McDonough *et al.*, 1993) and exhibits reduced virulence in animal models (guinea pig and mice) (Steenken *et al.*, 1934; Larson and Wicht, 1964; Alsaadi and Smith, 1973). In attempts to understand the mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis, genomic and transcriptomic approaches have been used to compare the virulent strain *Mtb* H37Rv with its avirulent counterpart *Mtb* H37Ra (Brosch *et al.*, 1999; Rindi *et al.*, 1999; Gao *et al.*, 2004; Mostowy *et al.*, 2004). However, the involvement of the genetic variations identified in the attenuation of *Mtb* H37Ra *in vivo* remained unclear. In 2008, three parallel surveys extended the investigations by seeking single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the *Mtb* H37Ra genome relative to virulent *Mtb* strains (Frigui *et al.*, 2008; Lee *et al.*, 2008; Zheng *et al.*, 2008). Many genetic variations were found to be potential strain-specific sequence polymorphisms of the *Mtb* H37Rv reference strain or

sequencing errors. Nevertheless, it was found that the attenuation of strain *Mtb* H37Ra was probably due to several distinct genetic lesions; three SNPs were identified as H37Ra-specific mutations (Lee et al., 2008). One was located in *phoP* (*Rv*0757), impairing the DNA-binding capacity of the PhoP/PhoR two-component virulence regulator and consequently the secretion of the 6-kD early-secreted antigenic target ESAT-6 (Frigui et al., 2008), a key antigen and virulence factor of *Mtb* (Pym et al., 2002). Another mutation mapped in the *Rv*0101 gene that encodes a putative non-ribosomal peptide synthase and is part of the *Rv*0096-*Rv*0101 operon, essential for the biosynthesis of another kind of virulence factor, the phthiocerol dimycocerosates, and for *Mtb* survival in mouse macrophages and guinea pigs (Hotter et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2007). The third mutation is an *Mtb* H37Ra-specific nucleotide insertion in gene *Rv*0637 (*hadC*) (Lee et al., 2008; Zheng et al., 2008), which is of particular interest as this gene belongs to the essential *Rv*0635-*Rv*0636-*Rv*0637 (*hadA-hadB-hadC*) gene cluster that encodes the hot dog folded proteins HadA, HadB and HadC (Sacco et al., 2007). These proteins are the subunits of two heterodimeric dehydratases, HadAB and HadBC, of the hydratase 2 family, corresponding to a new type of structure in bacteria. They are part of *Mtb* fatty acid synthase type II (FAS-II) system and catalyze the step of (3*R*)-hydroxyacyl-ACP dehydration (Sacco et al., 2007) (Fig. S1). The mycobacterial FAS-II system has a unique function of fatty acid elongation and is involved in the biosynthesis of mycolic acids (MAs) (Fig. S1), which are very long chain (*C*~74~–*C*~89~ in *Mtb*) α-alkyl β-hydroxy fatty acids (Marrakchi et al., 2014) (Fig. 1A). MAs are the major components of the outer membrane (mycomembrane), contributing to the architecture and the permeability of the mycobacterial envelope (Daffé and Draper, 1998; Gebhardt et al., 2007). They are important for *Mtb* virulence and persistence in the infected host, either as free acids or integrated into complex lipids such as trehalose dimycolate (Dubnau et al., 2000; Rao et al., 2006; Riley, 2006; Bhatt et al., 2007; Dao et al., 2008; Vander Beken et al., 2011; Verschoor et al., 2012). The main hydrocarbon chain (*C*~48~–*C*~63~ in *Mtb*), called the ‘meromycolic chain’, of MAs has various functions introduced by a family of specialized methyltransferases at proximal and distal positions with respect to the carboxyl group, thus defining different types of MAs. The *Mtb* complex is characterized by a combination of three major types of MAs: the α-MAs mostly with two *cis*-cyclopropane rings, the methoxy-MAs carrying a methoxy group and a *cis*- or *trans*-cyclopropane ring, and the keto-MAs with a keto function and a *cis*- or *trans*-cyclopropane ring (Marrakchi et al., 2014) (Fig. 1A). Subtle differences in the structure of the chemical groups and the chain length of MAs are determinant for their biological activities, implicated at different steps of the *Mtb*

MA distribution is strongly affected by *hadC* mutation or deletion (in *Mtb* H37Ra and *Mtb* H37RvΔ*hadC*), with a decrease in the methoxy-MA content compensated by an increase in α-MAs.

infectious process (Dubnau et al., 2000; Rao et al., 2006; Riley, 2006; Bhatt et al., 2007; Vander Beken et al., 2011; Verschoor et al., 2012). MAs are involved in the pathogenicity of mycobacteria suggesting that there might be a link between the mutation in *hadC* and the attenuation of *Mtb* H37Ra. We therefore investigated the biological function and importance for virulence of the HadC protein, which is highly conserved in different lineages of the *Mtb* complex and even in the more distantly related *M. canettii* strains (Supply et al., 2013; Boritsch et al., 2014).

Results

The hadABC locus in M. tuberculosis H37Ra

Bioinformatic analyses of *Mtb* H37Ra genome with BlastP program using sequences of *Mtb* H37Rv as probes revealed that all genes encoding the proteins known to be involved in the biosynthesis of MAs are present in the H37Ra genome. These analyses also showed an overall conservation of the corresponding peptic sequences, which only differed for the *hadABC* locus (Table S1). Indeed, genomic surveys of *Mtb* H37Ra (referred to as strain ATCC 25177 in both publications) described a 1 bp insertion in the *MRA0648* gene, the orthologue of the *Rv0637* (*hadC*) gene of *Mtb* H37Rv (Lee et al., 2008; Zheng et al., 2008). In only one of these two studies, a 5 bp deletion in *MRA0646*, the orthologue of *Rv0635* (*hadA*), was also reported (Zheng et al., 2008). This discrepancy might be linked either to sequencing errors or to the use of different *Mtb* H37Ra variants derived from the same parent strain by repeated subcultures. During the present work, we used *Mtb* H37Ra strain CIP 103471 from the Institut Pasteur Collection (Frigui et al., 2008). Sequencing of the *hadABC* region of that strain revealed that both *hadA* and *hadB* copies were strictly identical to those of *Mtb* H37Rv reference sequence (Cole et al., 1998), in agreement with Lee et al. (2008). The *hadC* allele of that *Mtb* H37Ra strain contains the previously reported single nucleotide insertion (C) in a GC rich region at base pair 88 (*Rv0637* numbering); it causes a frameshift in *MRA0648*, generating an early stop codon (Fig. S2).

Influence of the *hadC* mutation on the mycolic acid profile

The consequences of *hadC* mutation on the MAs produced by *Mtb* H37Ra were investigated. The absolute content of MAs in *Mtb* H37Ra (ratio MA/delipidated bacterial residue dry weight: 11.3 ± 0.4%) was not different to that in *Mtb* H37Rv (11.3 ± 1.1%). In contrast, major changes in the relative abundances of the three MA classes were observed (Fig. 1B and C). The percentage of methoxy-MA strongly decreased in *Mtb* H37Ra (21% versus 49% in H37Rv), compensated by substantially more α-MAs (64%) than in *Mtb* H37Rv (41%) (Fig. 1B and C). Hence, the ratio α-MAs:oxygenated-MAs was 1.8 in H37Ra versus 0.7 in H37Rv. Complementation of *Mtb* H37Ra with either the wild-type (wt) *hadC* (*hadC*<sub>Rv</sub>) or both wt *hadB* and *hadC* allele(s) (*hadBC*<sub>Rv</sub>) from *Mtb* H37Rv resulted in similar intermediate phenotypes (Fig. 1B and C). To confirm the direct involvement of the *hadC* gene in the relative distribution of MAs in *Mtb*, a deletion mutant was constructed in strain H37Rv, and named H37RvΔ*hadC*. The mutant was viable, showing that *hadC* is not essential for *Mtb* growth in culture. *Mtb* H37RvΔ*hadC* displayed a phenotype similar but even more marked than that of H37Ra, with a ratio α-MAs:oxygenated-MAs of 2.7 (Fig. 1B and C). The complemented strain *Mtb* H37RvΔ*hadC/hadC*<sub>Rv</sub> recovered the MA profile of wt H37Rv (Fig. 1B and C). Thus, the abnormalities of the MA production by *Mtb* H37Ra are a direct consequence of the insertion in the *hadC* allele. Consistent with this, no complementation was observed after transformation of *Mtb* H37RvΔ*hadC* with *hadC* allele from *Mtb* H37Ra (*hadC*<sub>Ra</sub>), and the complete deletion of this allele in H37Ra did not significantly affect the MA distribution (Fig. 1B and C), providing further evidence of the inactivity of the *hadC* gene of H37Ra.

Effects of *hadC* mutation on the fine structure of standard-sized (*C*<sub>74</sub>–*C*<sub>91</sub>) mycolic acids

To determine the fine structure of the MAs in the *hadC* mutant strains, they were purified and analyzed as MA methyl esters (MAMEs) by both MALDI-TOF MS and <sup>1</sup>H-NMR spectroscopy. The structures of the methoxy and keto-MAs in both *Mtb* H37Ra and *Mtb* H37RvΔ*hadC* showed large differences to those in H37Rv wt. Both mutant strains exhibited a total loss of the trans-cyclopropane rings (Table 1). Moreover, the oxygenated MAMEs displayed an abnormal degree of unsaturation affecting the cis-cyclopropanes and, in some cases, the double bonds, with a global increase of about 50% relative to *Mtb*H37Rv molecules (Table 1). This suggested that half of the oxygenated mycolates possessed an additional unsaturation. Consistent with these observations, two new series of molecules appeared on mass spectra of methoxy-MAMEs from *Mtb* H37Ra (Fig. 2, green and red labels). One series mainly carried an extra cyclopropane ring (Fig. 2, red labels, increment of 12 Da), and the other series possessed an extra double bond (Fig. 2, green labels, loss of 2 Da). The same phenomenon was observed for the keto-MAMEs (Fig. S3). The phenotype of the *Mtb* H37RvΔ*hadC* mutant was similar but more severe, and the introduction of an additional cyclopropane prevailed over the addition of a double bond (Table 1, Fig. 2 and Fig. S3, red labels). The longest monocyclopropanated methoxy-and keto-MAs (*C*<sub>85</sub>–*C*<sub>89</sub> and *C*<sub>84</sub>–*C*<sub>88</sub> respectively) observed in *Mtb* H37Rv wt (Fig. 2 and Fig. S3, black labels) were for a large part supplanted by dicyclopropanated MAs of similar sizes (*C*<sub>86</sub>–*C*<sub>90</sub> and *C*<sub>85</sub>–*C*<sub>89</sub> respectively) in *Mtb* H37RvΔ*hadC* (Fig. 2 and Fig. S3, red labels). Thus, while the fine structures of the oxygenated MAs differed in both *Mtb* H37Ra and *Mtb* H37RvΔ*hadC* compared with H37Rv, the chain lengths of their carbon skeleton remained roughly the same (Fig. 2 and Fig. S3). Interestingly, we also observed weak MS signals corresponding to oxygenated MAs with three unsaturations (loss of 4 mass units) in both *Mtb* H37Ra and *Mtb* H37RvΔ*hadC* (Fig. 2 and

Fig. 2. Impact of hadC mutation on the fine structure of standard-sized methoxy-mycolic acids.

MALDI-TOF MS analysis of the purified MAMEs. In both hadC-deficient strains, *Mtb* H37Ra and *Mtb* H37RvΔhadC, unusual methoxy-MAs bearing an additional unsaturation (*cis*-cyclopropane or *cis*-double bond) are produced. These structural modifications are specifically linked to hadC mutation or deletion, as shown by the recovery of the wt phenotype after complementation by hadC from *Mtb* H37Rv. Black labels, *cis*-monocyclopropanated MAMEs; blue labels, *trans*-monocyclopropanated MAMEs; green labels, *cis*-cyclopropanated *cis*-ethylenic MAMEs; red labels, *cis,cis*-dicyclopropanated or *cis,cis*-diethylenic MAMEs (traces of the latter if any in *Mtb* H37RvΔhadC); purple labels, triunsaturated MAMEs. Schematics of the molecules are drawn in matching colors; thick lines represent saturated hydrocarbon chains. See examples of detailed formula in Fig. 1A. The carbon numbers mentioned above *m/z* values are those of the free MAs. To exemplify variations within *Mtb* H37Rv strain, two variants, CIP 64.31 and Tlse (see Supporting Experimental Procedures), were analyzed. Although their phenotypes were very similar, it is noteworthy that the MAs from *Mtb* H37Rv CIP 64.31 were 2-carbon shorter than those from *Mtb* H37Rv Tlse.

amounts may vary (Davidson et al., 1982). This regulation process may explain why the percentage of keto-MAs stay almost unchanged in hadC-deficient strains, whereas that of methoxy-MAs is greatly reduced (Fig. 1C).

**Involvement of hadC gene in the biosynthesis of atypical extra-long mycolic acids**

In a previous study, we have shown that the purified HadBC heterodimer has a predilection for longer chain substrates as compared with HadAB enzyme (Sacco et al., 2007). Furthermore, the genera of the Corynebacteriales order producing medium chain MAs (*C*₃₄–*C*₆₀), like Rhodococcus and Nocardia, carry hadA and hadB orthologues but do not have a hadC orthologue. Therefore, we have hypothesized that HadBC enzyme is involved in the

late elongation cycles catalyzed by FAS-II, and HadAB in early elongation steps (Sacco et al., 2007) (Fig. S1). Unexpectedly however, hadC mutations in both *Mtb* H37Ra and H37RvΔhadC were not associated with a general shortening of the MA chain length (Fig. 2 and Fig. S3) despite the major effects on their structure, as shown above. Strikingly, very high mass signals of low intensity were reproducibly detected in the MALDI-TOF mass spectra of the purified methoxy-, keto and α-MAs from *Mtb* H37Rv (Fig. 3 and Fig. S5). They corresponded to series of atypical extra-long MAs (XL-MAs) with 9–13 more carbons than the major standard-sized MAs (Fig. 3 and Fig. S5). Since the meromycolic chains are elongated by successive additions of two carbons (Fig. S1), this increment of an odd number of carbons indicated that the XL-MAs carried an additional cyclopropane, and were

HadBC involvement in M. tuberculosis virulence 799

An *Mtb* H37Rv strain expressing the *hadC* gene under the control of a tetracycline-inducible promoter was constructed. When *hadC* was overexpressed, the XL-MAs were clearly detected in the total MA mix, whereas they were not visible in the absence of tetracycline, demonstrating the link between *hadC* expression and production of XL-MAs (Fig. S6). Thus, most methoxy- and keto-XL-MAs were undetectable in MA samples purified from the *hadC*-deficient strains *Mtb* H37Ra and H37RvΔ*hadC* (Fig. 3, Fig. S5 and Table S3). The longest diunsaturated oxygenated MAs in *Mtb* H37Ra had 91–92 carbons and in *Mtb* H37RvΔ*hadC* 89–90 carbons, corresponding to sizes of meromycolic chain skeleton (*C*~62~–*C*~64~ and *C*~60~–*C*~62~ respectively) at the boundary between standard-sized MAs and XL-MAs (Fig. 3, Fig. S5 and Table S3). In contrast, α-XL-MAs biosynthesis persisted partially in both H37Ra and H37RvΔ*hadC* (Fig. S5 and Table S3). In the complemented strains, the production of oxygenated XL-MAs was recovered (Fig. 3, Fig. S5 and Table S3).

These data clearly demonstrate the involvement of the HadC subunit in the biosynthesis of an additional unsaturated segment of the meromycolic chain giving atypical extra-long *C*~91~–*C*~98~ methoxy- and keto-XL-MAs (Fig. 4). When HadBC enzyme is absent, the third function (unsaturation) that is usually introduced into meromycolic chain skeletons beyond *C*~60~ (Fig. 4) is probably integrated by default into available shorter substrates, the standard-sized meromycolic chains, resulting in the synthesis of anomalous standard-sized oxygenated MAs bearing two unsaturations. The production of such anomalous MAs among the α-MAs in *hadC*-deficient strains implies that HadBC enzyme is also partially involved in the production of the α-XL-MAs. The partial persistence of α-XL-MAs biosynthesis, however, suggests that HadAB function (or a distinct unknown dehydratase function) partially overlaps that of HadBC and is sufficient to maintain a basal production in the absence of HadBC (Fig. 4). Indeed, the α-XL-MAs are naturally shorter than the methoxy- and keto-XL-MAs, and the α-meromycolic carbon skeleton (*C*~58~–*C*~64~) is four carbons shorter on average than that of the oxygenated meromycolic chains (*C*~62~–*C*~68~) (Fig. 4).

Effect of *hadC* mutation on the morphotype, biofilm growth, tolerance to stresses and virulence of *M.* tuberculosis

The H37Rv and H37Ra variants of isolate *Mtb* H37 were originally dissociated based on their distinct colony morphologies (Steenken *et al.*, 1934; Steenken and Gardner, 1946). The colonies of *Mtb* H37RvΔ*hadC* were very small with a clear-cut periphery reminiscent of those of H37Ra (Fig. 5A). The colonies of wt H37Rv were much larger with a veil-like periphery, and both H37Ra/*hadC*~Rv~ and H37RvΔ*hadC*/*hadC*~Rv~ complemented strains exhibited an

Fig. 4. Specific functions of HadAB and HadBC enzymes in mycolic acid biosynthesis.

Our study shows that HadAB enzyme is dedicated to the early FAS-II elongation cycles (orange thick arrow; see also Fig. S1), during which two chemical functions would be incorporated, leading to the formation of standard-sized α-meromycolic chains (C₄₆-C₅₆ skeletons), precursors of the α-mycolic acids. Part of these molecules are further elongated, mainly by HadBC enzyme (blue arrow), during late FAS-II elongation cycles to produce standard-sized oxygenated meromycolic chains (C₅₀-C₆₀ skeletons), precursors of the keto- and methoxy-mycolic acids. Additionally, HadBC extends part of the meromycolic chains to generate a fourth cyclopropanated segment of 9–13 carbons, resulting in the synthesis of extra-long (XL) α- and oxygenated meromycolic chains (C₅₈-C₆₄ and C₆₂-C₆₈ skeletons respectively). HadAB and HadBC activities would partially overlap. Thus, in hadC-deficient strains (Mtb H37Ra, Mtb H37RvΔhadC), HadAB would partly take over HadBC function and catalyze part of the late elongation cycles (orange thin arrow), allowing the formation of reduced amounts of standard-sized oxygenated MAs and XL-α-MAs, although we cannot rule out that this is due to the intervention of another unknown dehydratase. In these mutant strains, HadAB is not able to generate the longer XL-keto/methoxy-meromycolic chains (C₆₂–C₆₈ skeletons); the 3rd function (unsaturation) that is usually incorporated in the latter molecules is by default integrated in shorter available substrates (standard-sized meromycolic chains), resulting in the synthesis of anomalous standard-sized MAs bearing an additional unsaturation (cyclopropane or double bond) (see Fig. 2 and Fig. S3). Gray arrows represent the condensation step of the meromycolic chains with the C₂₆ saturated fatty acyl chain (see Fig. S1). The lengths of the carbon skeletons [omitting carbons of the methoxy group, methyl branch(es), and methylene of cyclopropane rings] are indicated in standard font based on molecules from Mtb H37Rv CIP 64.31.

intermediate phenotype (Fig. 5A). Another characteristic of the virulent Mtb bacilli is their capacity to aggregate into cord-like structures during growth in culture (Middlebrook et al., 1947) (Fig. 5B). In contrast, the avirulent variant Mtb H37Ra has never been observed to form cords under any condition of growth (Middlebrook et al., 1947). Like H37Ra, Mtb H37RvΔhadC had lost the ability to form cords (Fig. 5B). Complementation with a wt hadCᴿᵥ copy partially restored the cording phenotype to the deletion mutant but not to Mtb H37Ra (Fig. 5B), suggesting that H37Ra carries additional mutations preventing restoration of cording. HadC deficiency had also an impact on the bacterial growth as a pellicle. The biofilm had a reduced thickness and displayed a different aspect in Mtb H37RvΔhadC mutant relative to H37Rv wt and to the complemented strain H37RvΔhadC/hadCᴿᵥ (Fig. S7A).

We then measured the impact of hadC inactivation on the sensitivity to a detergent, SDS, and to various antibiotics: three first-line TB drugs, rifampicin, isoniazid and ethambutol, and a broad spectrum fluoroquinolone, ciprofloxacin. As shown in Table 2, Mtb H37RvΔhadC strain was more sensitive than the wt strain to several of these molecules and specially to rifampicin, suggesting a significant effect of hadC deletion on the envelope integrity. To investigate the consequences of hadC deficiency for virulence, the multiplication of the complemented Mtb

HadC mutation (Mtb H37Ra) or deletion (Mtb H37RvΔhadC) induces a change in the colony morphology, a loss of the cording phenotype (bacterial aggregation into cord-like structures) and a marked loss of virulence relative to wt Mtb (H37Rv).

physical properties of the mycomembrane. First, trans-cyclopropanes cause a decrease in the cell wall fluidity (Liu *et al.*, 1996); they facilitate the folding of the oxygenated MAs into W-form conformations with the four hydrocarbon chains in parallel, allowing tight packing of the MAs in *Mtb* H37Rv (Villeneuve *et al.*, 2013). Consistent with this, the absence of trans-cyclopropane rings prevents the oxygenated MAs of *Mtb* H37Ra from adopting stable fully folded W-form conformations (Villeneuve *et al.*, 2013). Second, the overall MA chain length is also a major determinant of cell wall fluidity, longer molecules being associated with lower fluidity (Liu *et al.*, 1996). Thus, the presence of extra-long MAs in wt *Mtb* might be an additional factor contributing to the extremely low permeability of its mycomembrane. The XL-MAs may potentially adopt a 'tripleU-form' conformation where the additional segment of the meromycolic chain folds parallel to the other hydrocarbon chains, facilitating MA packing. Therefore, the loss of the oxygenated XL-MAs observed in *Mtb hadC* mutants may also affect the permeability of their cell envelope. The higher sensitivity of H37RvΔhadC to diverse compounds, and particularly to rifampicin, a large lipophilic molecule, as well as the reduced acid-fastness of *Mtb* H37Ra strain (Middlebrook *et al.*, 1947) triggered by multiple mycolic acid structural changes most likely reflect a disruption in the organization of the mycomembrane, which acts as an hydrophobic permeability barrier and contributes to the intrinsic resistance of mycobacteria to hydrophobic drugs (Liu *et al.*, 1996).

Integration of a wt *hadC*<sub>Rv</sub> copy into *Mtb* H37Ra significantly increased its virulence in SCID mice, whereas the deletion of the *hadC* gene from *Mtb* H37Rv significantly reduced virulence and affected its morphology and its capacities to form cords and biofilms. We used the bacterial load in organs of SCID mice as a readout of virulence, as this murine model provides a rapid and sensitive method for evaluating *in vivo* growth characteristics of mycobacterial strains during the acute phase of infection, appropriate for low virulent strains such as *Mtb* H37Ra or other attenuated strains (Pym *et al.*, 2002; Hsu *et al.*, 2003; Frigui *et al.*, 2008; Bottai *et al.*, 2011). Consistent with our findings, the fine structures of the mycolic acids are known to affect the virulence level of *Mtb* (Dubnau *et al.*, 2000; Rao *et al.*, 2006). They also contribute to determining the colony morphology and the abilities of *Mtb* to develop biofilms or to aggregate in planktonic cultures as cord structures important for virulence (Hunter *et al.*, 2006; Glickman, 2008; Ojha *et al.*, 2008; Sambandan *et al.*, 2013). In particular, oxygenated free mycolic acids, whose content is greatly reduced in the *hadC* mutants, are essential to biofilm growth (Ojha *et al.*, 2008; Sambandan *et al.*, 2013). They were also described as key factors of *Mtb* virulence (Dubnau *et al.*, 2000), playing a role in the selective repression of macrophage IL-12p40 cytokine produc-

tion aimed to evade elimination by the host immune system (Dao *et al.*, 2008). From our observations, we conclude that the insertion mutation in *hadC* of *Mtb* H37Ra is partly responsible for the loss of both virulence and cording morphology of this strain, as consequences of the profound changes in the distribution and fine structure of the mycolic acids. This might act at two different levels: (i) the molecular arrangement and fluidity of the mycomembrane (see above) and (ii) the biological activities of the mycolate-containing compounds that are pathogenicity factors. Indeed, it is known that subtle changes to the fine structure of the mycoloyl chains, affecting chain length or the nature of the chemical functions, can have large effects on their biological activities (Vander Beken *et al.*, 2011; Verschoor *et al.*, 2012).

Finally, our findings also may be relevant to drug development (Le Chevalier *et al.*, 2014). Several new compounds discovered in this post TB genomic era through target-based screening focusing on MA metabolism are very promising as TB therapeutics (North *et al.*, 2014). HadBC, unlike the other known bacterial (3*R*)-hydroxyacyl-ACP dehydratases, belongs to the hydratase 2 enzyme family (Sacco *et al.*, 2007) and metabolizes extremely long chain substrates (Fig. 4). Moreover, it has been recently shown that isoxyl and thiacetazone TB drugs both target the dehydration step of the FAS-II system triggering the inhibition of the MA biosynthesis pathway. In particular, overexpression of *hadBC* or the presence of point mutations in *hadC* confer resistance to these drugs (Belardinelli and Morbidoni, 2012; Grzegorzewicz *et al.*, 2012; Gannoun-Zaki *et al.*, 2013), strongly suggesting that HadBC is a vulnerable and druggable enzyme. Its singularity and the role it plays in *Mtb* virulence, as demonstrated here, make HadBC an attractive target for therapeutic purposes.

### Experimental procedures

#### Sequence analyses and sequencing

Bioinformatic analysis of *Mtb* H37Ra genome [NC_009525 (Zheng *et al.*, 2008)] was performed by BlastP alignment (Altschul *et al.*, 1997) using genes of *Mtb* H37Rv [TubercuList Web server (Lew *et al.*, 2011)] as probes. DNA sequencing was carried out (Millegen, Toulouse, France) with Big Dye Terminator Chemistry V3.1 on a 3130XL capillary automated sequencing system (Applied Biosystems). Alignments were performed using the software Clone Manager 9 (Windows) and shaped using Boxshade version 3.21 software.

#### Cultures

For biofilm growth and MA extractions, *Mtb* strains were grown as pellicles in Middlebrook 7H9 broth (Difco) supplemented with 0.2% glycerol, 10% albumin-dextrose-catalase (ADC)
(Difco) and the required antibiotics in glass bottles for 5 weeks. Planktonic cultures were performed with shaking in Middlebrook 7H9 medium (Difco) containing 0.05% Tween 80, 0.2% glycerol plus 10% ADC (Difco) and the required antibiotics. Planktonic growth kinetics were undertaken in 17 ml tubes. For solid medium, Middlebrook 7H11 containing 0.5% glycerol and 10% oleic acid-albumin-dextrose-catalase (OADC) (Difco) was used with the required antibiotics. Antibiotic concentrations used were as follow: 50 µg ml⁻¹ hygromycin, 40 µg ml⁻¹ kanamycin, 20 ng ml⁻¹ tetracyclin, 10 µg ml⁻¹ zeocin. For *E. coli* growth, Luria–Bertani medium was used with antibiotics when required (40 µg ml⁻¹ kanamycin, 200 µg ml⁻¹ hygromycin). All cultures were incubated at 37°C.

### Construction of the deletion mutants and complemented strains

See also Supporting Experimental Procedures. *Mtb* H37RvΔhadC and H37RaΔhadC mutants were generated from *Mtb* H37Rv CIP 64.31 (ATCC 27294) and H37Ra strain CIP 103471 (ATCC 25177) (Collection Institut Pasteur, Paris, France) respectively, with the recombineering system as described (van Kessel and Hatfull, 2007). The replacement of the target gene by the zeocin resistance cassette and the absence of any wt allele copy as well as of any major rearrangement in the region were checked by PCR. For complementation and overexpression experiments, *Mtb* H37Ra, *Mtb* H37Rv and *Mtb* H37RvΔhadC were transformed by plasmids carrying *Rv0637* or *phoP* gene from *Mtb* H37Rv or *MRA0648* gene from *Mtb* H37Ra and constructed as described in Supporting Experimental Procedures.

### Mycolic acid extraction and quantification

MAs were extracted from the different strains as previously described (Lanéelle et al., 2012), dried and weighted. The dry weights of MAs were normalized by the dry weights of the bacterial residues. MAs were methylated with diazomethane and the resulting MAMEs were purified by preparative TLC on silica gel 60 (Macherey-Nagel) developed with petroleum ether/diethylether (9:1, v/v, five runs). The relative abundances of the different MA classes were determined by loading a fixed amount (10 µg) of MA mixture onto a TLC silica gel 60 plate (Merck) developed in petroleum ether/diethylether (9:1, v/v, five runs) and stained by immersion in 0.01% primuline (in acetone:water, 8:2). The intensity of each spot was measured by fluorescence at 370 nm.

### Argentation TLC analysis

To search for the presence of ethylenic compounds, purified mycolate fractions were resolved on AgNO₃-impregnated silica HPTLC plates developed with petroleum ether:diethyl-ether (7:3, v/v, two runs). The cleavage of ethylenic MAMEs was performed by permanganate-periodate oxidation (von Rudloff, 1956) at 30°C in tertiary butanol as solvent. The acids obtained from the oxidative cleavages were methylated and purified on preparative TLC with dichloromethane as eluent.

MALDI-TOF MS and <sup>1</sup>H-NMR spectroscopy

MALDI-MS detection of purified samples in reflectron mode was performed on a 4700 Proteomics Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Voyager DE-STR, Framingham, MA) equipped with an Nd:YAG laser (355 nm) operating by pulses of 500 ps with a frequency of 200 Hz. Two thousand five hundred shots were accumulated in positive ion mode, and MS data were acquired using the instrument default calibration. Mycolate samples were dissolved in chloroform, at the concentration of 1 mM, and were directly spotted onto the target plate as 0.5 µl droplets, followed by the addition of 0.5 µl of matrix solution: 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (10 mg ml⁻¹) in CHCl₃/CH₃OH (1:1, v/v). Samples were allowed to crystallize at room temperature. <sup>1</sup>H-NMR spectra of purified samples were obtained in CDCl₃ (99.9% D) at 298 K using a Bruker AVANCE 600 MHz spectrometer (Bruker Biospin) equipped with a 5 mm cryoprobe TCI. Chemical shifts values (in ppm) were relative to the internal CHCl₃ resonance (at 7.26 ppm).

### Mouse infection experiments

Virulence studies were performed in severe combined immune-deficient (SCID) mice. Briefly, groups of 6 week old C.B-17/lcr SCID mice (Charles River) were intravenously infected with a bacterial suspension containing 1–2 × 10⁵ CFU/mouse. Three weeks after infection, mice were euthanized, and spleen and lungs were homogenized in 2 ml tubes containing 500 µl Sauton medium and 2.5 mm diameter glass beads using an MM300 apparatus (Qiagen). CFU numbers in target organs were determined by plating 5- or 10-fold serial dilutions of organ homogenates on solid medium and incubation at 37°C. Statistical differences in bacterial loads were determined by ANOVA test with Tukey correction, after conversion of CFU numbers in Log10 CFU values. Statistical significance was considered to be a *P* value ≤ 0.05. These studies were approved by the Institut Pasteur Safety Committee (Protocol 11.245; experimentation authorization number 75–1469), in accordance with European and French guidelines (Directive 86/609/CEE and Decree 87–848 of 19 October 1987), and implicating approval from local ethical committees (CETEA 2013-0036). All animals were observed daily and were weighed once a week in compliance with ethical requirements and to monitor any adverse effects possibly related to the infection.

### Colony morphology and cording analyses

For the analysis of the colony morphologies, serial dilutions of a liquid culture of each strain were spotted onto Middlebrook 7H11 agar supplemented with 0.5% glycerol and 10% OADC, and grown for 2 weeks. For cording analysis, the strains were grown for 7 days in Middlebrook 7H9 broth supplemented with 0.5% glycerol and 10% ADC and stained following the Ziehl–Neelsen procedure (Allen, 1992).

### Evaluation of *Mtb* sensitivity to diverse molecules

The sensitivity levels of *Mtb* strains to antibiotics and SDS were evaluated by determining the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs), using a colorimetric microassay
