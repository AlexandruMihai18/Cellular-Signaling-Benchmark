Lafontan M. Historical perspectives in fat cell biology: the fat cell as a model for the investigation of hormonal and metabolic pathways. Am J Physiol Cell Physiol 302: C327–C359, 2012. First published September 7, 2011; doi:10.1152/ajpcell.00168.2011.—For many years, there was little interest in the biochemistry or physiology of adipose tissue. It is now well recognized that adipocytes play an important dynamic role in metabolic regulation. They are able to sense metabolic states via their ability to perceive a large number of nervous and hormonal signals. They are also able to produce hormones, called adipokines, that affect nutrient intake, metabolism, and energy expenditure at various points. Around the beginning of the 20th century, adipose tissue was considered to be a connective tissue filled with droplets of fat. Adipose tissue was believed to be limited in the body to an insulating role against heat loss and to provide mechanical support for certain tissues. Fat stores were considered to be exclusively passive in nature and not involved in the general energy metabolism of the body. In the 1940s, deuterium oxide was used to study the conversion of carbohydrates to fatty acids. The deuterium introduced into fatty acids was taken as a measure of the newly synthesized fatty acids. At that time, the liver was considered to be the predominant site of energy metabolism of lipids, while only a minor role was attributed to adipose tissue. However, this assumption was contested by some researchers, who showed that carbohydrate could be converted to fat in extrahepatic tissues. In the case of the regulation of fat deposition, the role of the conversion of carbohydrates to fat in adipose tissue and the direct effect of insulin on the transformation of glucose into fatty acids become obvious after the pioneering studies of Shapiro and Wertheimer (321) on rodent adipose tissue. Their review article on the theme “the physiology of adipose tissue,” published in 1948, summarized the knowledge about fat. In contrast to the dogma of the time, they proposed that adipose tissue was metabolically active and that “deposition and mobilization of fat...are regulated by nervous and endocrine factors” (389). In 1965, an entire volume of the Handbook of Physiology, containing >4,000 references, was published on adipose tissue (273).

This review focuses on the very early approaches that used the fat cell as a tool to discover and understand various cellular mechanisms. Attention essentially focuses on the early investigations revealing the major contribution of mature fat cells and also fat cells originating from adipose cell lines to the discovery of major events related to hormone action (hormone receptors and transduction pathways involved in hormonal signaling) and mechanisms involved in metabolite processing (hexose uptake and uptake, storage, and efflux of fatty acids). Dormant preadipocytes exist in the stroma-vascular fraction of the adipose tissue of rodents and humans; cell culture systems have proven to be valuable models for the study of the processes involved in the formation of new fat cells. Finally, more recent insights into adipocyte secretion, a completely new role with major metabolic impact, are also briefly summarized.

SINCE THE EARLIEST TIMES, attention has been directed toward fat-related questions. It is currently accepted that the ability to store fat in adipose tissue was a major advantage for survival during cold winters and periods of food shortage for our “primitive” hunter ancestors. However, in modern societies, with increased food availability and nutritional efficacy, excessive fat deposition is frequently associated with degenerative or metabolic diseases. As early as 1901, life insurance companies noted that excess weight, particularly around the abdomen, was linked to reduced life expectancy. The risk was confirmed in the seminal studies of Vague (366) in Marseilles, who established the importance of abdominal (central) obesity in conferring excess mortality. The health hazard of obesity is not considered in the present review, which, rather, focuses on adipose tissue and adipocytes.

field of adipose tissue research and also provided valuable tools to investigators to decipher major cellular pathways. In this review, attention essentially focuses on the early investigations revealing the major contribution of mature fat cells and fat cells originating from adipose cell lines to the discovery of major events related to hormone action (hormone receptors and transduction pathways involved in hormonal signaling) and mechanisms involved in metabolite processing (hexose uptake and influx, and storage and efflux of fatty acids). Early events revealing the secretory activity of adipocytes, a completely new role with important metabolic impacts, are briefly summarized. All the elements strictly related to lipogenesis and lipolytic pathways, as well as developmental/differentiation approaches, are not considered in detail. Except for some very early studies, detailed lipogenesis and lipolysis pathways per se are outside the scope of this historical perspective: these questions have been the subject of a large number of recent reviews (20, 211, 214, 380). In addition, the functions of brown adipose tissue and brown fat cells are beyond the scope of this review: a recent excellent review summarizes brown adipose tissue biology and physiology (47).

### Anatomic Structure of Adipose Tissues

The adipocyte, the “fat vesicle,” recognized as a specific cell type, was first mentioned and the initial observations on the growth and development of fat deposits were first reported in early studies in the 19th century (151, 166). An update of the comparative anatomy of adipose tissues in various species has been summarized in the *Handbook of Physiology* (367). The histological examination of adipose tissue development in fetuses and newborn rats and humans revealed all the stages of adipose tissue development and the existence of two major fat cell types (i.e., brown and white fat cells). The embryonic and postembryonic histogenesis of adipose tissues has been extensively studied [see original data (223) summarized and discussed by Wassermann (383) and other investigators (52, 155, 252, 327)].

Briefly, the histology of adipose tissue is similar in several species, and histologists had noted similarities in the morphology of developing white fat and brown fat (252). The development of white adipose tissue takes place in numerous anatomic locations. During the differentiation of white fat, the cells go through a stage (e.g., multilocular stage) that, at the level of light microscopy, has the morphological appearance of brown fat cells. Mature (i.e., fully differentiated) white adipocytes have a spherical shape, and a single lipid droplet, surrounded by a reduced rim of cytoplasm, essentially occupies the fat cell volume. The nucleus and all the organelles [i.e., mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and lysosomes] are pushed to the periphery of the cell. White adipocytes are the only cells that may vary dramatically in size (i.e., from 10 to 180 μm diameter) under physiological conditions. Differences in fat cell size are depot-specific: in humans, the subcutaneous adipocytes are usually larger than adipocytes in visceral depots. Capillaries can be seen among adipocytes; they play a major role in adipose tissue drainage. Sympathetic nervous system (SNS) fibers run along adipose tissue vessels, but few direct innervations of white adipocytes have been reported. Nevertheless, a number of studies provide unquestionable evidence that increased sympathetic drive to white adipose tissue is the primary stimulus triggering lipid mobilization in rodents and hamsters (19). When white adipose tissue undergoes major lipid depletion, the fat cells are able to revert toward a multilocular stage.

Brown adipose tissue is less abundant than white adipose tissue and is recognizable to the naked eye as a brownish fat depot; it is composed of brown adipocytes. Morphological studies have shown that brown fat cells contain numerous cytoplasmic lipid droplets with a central nucleus and a very large number of mitochondria characterized by typical laminar cristae generated by a prominent development of the inner mitochondrial membrane. Brown adipocytes are easily identified after labeling with antibodies for the uncoupling protein-1, a protein of the inner mitochondrial membrane responsible for the uncoupling of respiration and the thermogenic activity that characterizes these cells. Brown fat cells are surrounded by a dense vascular network, and they are directly innervated by SNS fibers (47). Recent studies have shown that brown fat cells and skeletal muscle may share a common developmental ancestry. Progenitors expressing Myf5 were shown to give rise to skeletal muscle and interscapular brown fat (187, 317, 359). However, some brown fat cell progenitors that are not expressing Myf5 have been found in white fat and between muscle bundles (311).

In the 1970s, electron microscopy was used to study in detail the plasma membrane of adipocytes (49, 68, 69, 178). The adipocyte plasma membrane is particularly rich in small invaginations. These structures are now recognized as caveolae, since they are labeled by antibodies directed to caveolin, a protein that is necessary for the formation of these structures (302). An atlas with a comprehensive overview of the morphology of adipose tissues and adipocytes has recently been published by Cinti (54). Images of brown and white adipose tissues are shown at anatomic, light-microscopic, and electron-microscopic (scanning and transmission) levels in various physiological situations. The detailed changes in adipocyte plasma membranes during lipolytic challenges are also described.

#### Very Early Studies on Adipose Tissue Metabolism: In Vitro Studies With Slices or Pieces of Adipose Tissue From Rodents and Humans

For many years, there was limited interest in the biochemistry and physiology of adipose tissue. The understanding of the physiology of adipose tissue originates from concomitant in vivo and in vitro approaches usually carried out by investigators with complementary expertise. The beginning of the in vitro approaches to adipose tissue biology was devoted to the study of enzymatic activities and enzyme patterns in crude adipose tissue homogenates. The bulk of the early in vitro studies was essentially carried out using isolated epididymal fat pads from rats and mice. This easily accessible fat pad was very convenient for metabolic approaches and exploration of the sensitivity to hormonal agents. Noticeable differences were revealed between the properties of rodent and human adipose tissue. Large differences exist in fatty acid synthesis in adipose tissue of rodents and humans. It is important to keep in mind such discrepancies and extrapolate with caution when generalizing concepts.

HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVES IN FAT CELL BIOLOGY

The authors who suggested for the first time that adipose tissue may play a role in fat synthesis had shown that, in all conditions favoring fatty acid synthesis from carbohydrates in rats, fat deposition in adipose tissue was preceded by the appearance of glycogen in fat tissue (246, 364). Shapiro and Wertheimer (321) pointed out that adipose tissue had a blood supply and was innervated by sympathetic nerve fibers. Using deuterium oxide, they investigated the synthesis of fatty acids in rat adipose tissue in vitro. The deuterium found in the fatty acids was used as a measure of fatty acid synthesis. These results confirmed that adipose tissue was capable of synthesizing fatty acids and showed that the rate of appearance of fatty acids in the adipose tissue was accelerated by a diet known to promote fat synthesis in the body. In 1954, Hausberger et al. (153) discovered that incubated pieces of adipose tissue converted glucose to lipids and that the rate of this process was increased in adipose tissue from animals treated with insulin. Using appropriate arteriovenous cannulations, Gordon (134) showed that areas rich in adipose tissue released free fatty acids into the circulation.

Extended historical details are provided in reviews covering the period 1940–1965 (274, 320, 374, 389). Some major points are summarized here (Table 1). The metabolic activity of rat and mouse adipose tissues has been extensively investigated using the in vitro approaches (i.e., enzymatic activities in adipose tissue homogenates and utilization of tracer molecules to delineate the metabolic pathways in fat pads under hormonal challenges). Results of concomitant in vivo investigations noticeably strengthened results from in vitro studies. A number of major basic metabolic aspects were delineated. The processes involved in the assimilation of circulating triglycerides contained in postprandial chylomicrons, the formation of triglycerides from free fatty acids and glucose, and the release of fatty acids from stored adipose tissue triglycerides were reported in a number of papers (summarized in Ref. 274). Adipose tissue pieces incubated with blood serum were shown to be able to assimilate triglycerides. Moreover, neutral fatty acid esters and free fatty acids could be taken up from artificial fat emulsions (337). Triglyceride uptake was found to be related to metabolic processes, since it was reduced at low

temperatures and abolished by heating at 60°C or by addition of metabolic inhibitors such as cyanide and fluoride to the incubation medium. At about that time, researchers suggested that a heparin-activated “clearing factor” might contribute to the removal of chylomicron triglycerides from the blood. This clearing factor was shown to be a lipase that preferentially hydrolyzed triglycerides in chylomicrons and large triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (i.e., VLDL) (113). Adipose tissue contains a lipase, lipoprotein lipase, with similar properties and activity, which was identified as playing a major role in the direct incorporation of fatty acids contained in dietary fat (199, 283). A correlation between lipoprotein lipase activity and triglyceride uptake was found in in vitro assays, although the final understanding of its role was validated by in vivo approaches. Its activity varies with nutritional state: activity falls during fasting and is rapidly restored by refeeding. It is an enzyme that promotes the deposition of triglycerides in adipose tissue. Triglycerides were shown to be hydrolyzed prior to uptake by lipoprotein lipase located in the capillary endothelium. Free fatty acids are assimilated by adipose tissue in vitro, and most of those acids taken up by the tissue could be esterified. Inclusion of glucose in vitro increased the assimilation of palmitate and its esterification. Glucose was shown to be used for synthesis of the fatty acids and the glycerol moiety of triglycerides (395, 396). Insulin increased the total conversion of glucose to triglycerides and had a major effect on the synthesis of free fatty acids. Esterification in adipose tissue was shown to proceed along pathways similar to those described in the liver. Moreover, the studies led to the discovery of insulin growth factors in human serum, particularly insulin-like growth factor I, which is identical to somatomedin C, a polypeptide produced in response to administration of growth hormone (116). The first steps in the synthesis of triglycerides in liver and adipose tissue homogenates were identified: they involved the esterification of α-glycerophosphate (15, 45, 46, 237), the availability of adequate amounts of which controls fat deposition in adipose tissue. It was clearly established that triglycerides are in a dynamic state in adipose tissue, in which esterification and lipolysis of fatty acids are occurring (397).

In the case of the release of fat from adipose tissue pads, convincing evidence had been obtained that free fatty acids were released from adipose tissue when catecholamines and corticotropin (ACTH) were included in the commonly used Krebs-Ringer phosphate incubation buffer (135, 276, 277, 390, 391). These early reports were responsible for the subsequent explosion of data on the hormonal regulation of adipose tissue metabolism. Free fatty acid release occurred only when albumin was present in the incubation medium (232, 392). Glycerol was released along with free fatty acids, and it was soon considered to be a good index of lipolysis (374, 393). Many peptides that differ in structure and physiological function induced similar responses by adipose tissue in vitro and in vivo in rodents (161, 303). The adipokinetic properties of hypophyseal peptides (ACTH and α- and β-melanocyte-stimulating hormone) were described in rodents (303). All the hormones found to stimulate the release of fatty acids from rat adipose tissue (epinephrine, ACTH, glucagon, and thyroid-stimulating hormone) also increased its O₂ consumption and enhanced glycogen breakdown. Since the glycogenolytic action of epinephrine had been related to its ability to produce adenosine 3′,5′-phosphate, the question was raised as to whether forma-

tion of this compound might be responsible for the stimulation by these hormones of glycogen and triglyceride breakdown in adipose tissue. A review by Steinberg and Vaughan (336) in 1965 summarizes the knowledge on the release of free fatty acids from rodent adipose tissue in vitro in relation to rates of triglyceride synthesis and degradation. In parallel with all the in vitro functional assays, several groups had been involved in the identification and enzymatic characterization of adipose tissue lipases. In addition to lipoprotein lipase (198, 199), homogenates of rat epididymal fat pads were shown to contain other lipase activity. Lipase activity in homogenates of adipose tissue was increased by exposure of the tissue to epinephrine or ACTH before homogenization. Hormone-sensitive and monoglyceride lipases were described in rodent adipose tissue (338, 373).

Some physiological characteristics of adipose tissue were explored using original perfusion techniques (164, 281). Perfusion of epididymal or parametrial fat pads with suitable perfusion buffers enriched with albumin was used to study adipose tissue. Vascular bed reactivity, an important element of adipose tissue biology that cannot be taken into account in the usual in vitro assays, could be explored using this technique. In general, the effects of hormones and pharmacological agents on free fatty acid release were similar to those observed in incubated tissues. However, with respect to epinephrine- or ACTH-stimulated free fatty acid release, the perfusion method was more sensitive than the method that used incubated adipose tissues. It was shown that the number and properties of free fatty acid-binding sites on the albumin flowing through the adipose tissue modulated free fatty acid availability.

For a long time, investigations on human adipose tissue were limited to its fatty acid composition. Adipose tissue homogenates were studied following various diets and in various pathological conditions. The first biological studies were performed on small adipose tissue pieces obtained by aspiration biopsies adapted for serial sampling (158), and the incubation conditions optimized (i.e., buffer composition, gas phase, effects of insulin, effect of biopsy size, kinetics of distribution of labeled precursors in labeled lipids, and expression of metabolic activity). Adipose tissue fragments containing 10⁴–10⁵ cells were used to study the rates of lipogenesis from glucose and acetate in vitro, as well as uptake and release of free fatty acids (160). The same assay system was also used to describe the impacts of calorie restriction and refeeding on adipose tissues from obese and nonobese individuals (132). Uptake of [1-¹⁴C]palmitate was greater in omental than subcutaneous adipose tissue, while spontaneous glycerol release did not differ noticeably (33, 147). The limits of the method were discussed by the authors. They suspected that the heterogeneity of response of fat deposits was based on the anatomic locations of the deposits. In vitro studies on rodent or human fat pads have been recognized to have some limitations. Conditions for optimized and reproducible responsiveness, particularly when comparisons between different fat deposits were concerned, are limited by the large differences related to the size of the adipose tissue fragments and their variable permeability to exogenous agents used to treat them. Problems could result from inadequate diffusion of nutrients and reduced oxygenation at the center of adipose tissue fragments. Subsequently, the most important developments in improving sensitivity and reproducibility came from the preparation of isolated fat cells.

HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVES IN FAT CELL BIOLOGY

**Isolated Fat Cell**

Early studies on fat cell isolation. It was rapidly considered that the isolation of fat cells from the extracellular matrix and stroma-vascular fraction (SVF) could facilitate metabolic investigations and the mechanistic approaches to hormone action in a pure preparation of a single cell type. Histology had previously shown that fat cells were surrounded by a matrix that was composed of collagen-like fibers (52). The proposal by Rodbell (284) in 1964 that collagenase treatment of adipose tissue would release fat cells from the extracellular matrix and SVF revolutionized studies on the regulation of adipose tissue metabolism. Fat cells, owing to their fat content, were easily separated by flotation. However, some limitations soon appeared: isolated fat cells are fragile, and they must be incubated in plastic or silicon-coated dishes. They rapidly lose their ability to metabolize glucose and respond to hormones; nevertheless, they remain viable for up to 24–48 h. Commercially available collagenase preparations are heterogeneous, and trypsin and other proteolytic enzymes used in classic cell preparations could alter hormone responsiveness, and the ability of cells to respond to insulin could be rapidly lost (100, 196). The isolation procedures and the incubation conditions have been optimized (i.e., ionic composition of the incubation buffer is important, as well as the presence of glucose and albumin). The effects of insulin and other hormones on glucose metabolism were explored, as well as the effects of lipolytic hormones on free fatty acid and glycerol release (284). Fat cells were shown to be able to convert \[^{14}C\]glucose to CO₂, glyceride-glycerol, and fatty acids, and insulin stimulated glucose uptake and metabolism. Lipolytic hormones increased the release of free fatty acids and glycerol, as had been described using incubated fat pads, but greater responsiveness was observed when isolated fat cells were used. Moreover, the reproducibility of results was noticeably improved. Lipolytic hormones stimulate not only the hydrolysis of triglycerides but also the esterification of free fatty acids. Lipolysis in isolated fat cells is affected by high free fatty acid concentrations in the cells; fat cells required albumin in the incubation buffer for optimal free fatty acid release. Glycerol, unlike free fatty acids, is not utilized to any significant extent, because mature adipocytes have no significant glycerol kinase activity (275). Fatty acids, which can be reesterified by fat cells, are stored as triglycerides after coupling to glycerol 3-phosphate, which is classically generated from glycolysis, and not from glycerol, because of the lack of glycerol kinase. Investigations based on this method were expanded by Rodbell (285, 286, 290) for biochemical investigations and to study the effects of various physiological and pharmacological agents. The technique has been adopted by a number of investigators to study various aspects of isolated fat cell responsiveness (93, 95, 98, 122). The isolated fat cell system has been used to investigate the impact of a large number of pharmacological compounds (e.g., methylxanthines, tolbutamine, nicotinic acid, various catecholamines, serotonin, adrenergic agonists and antagonists, antimalarial compounds, endotoxins and enterotoxins, and cholera toxin) on lipolysis and other metabolic events in isolated fat cells. The lipolysis engendered by growth hormone differs from that of fast-acting lipolytic agents in its lag time (i.e., 1–2 h) and its sensitivity to inhibitors of RNA and protein synthesis (99). Growth hormone exhibits a complex action: an insulin-like action of growth

hormone was observed during the 1st h of stimulation; later, its effect is lipolytic. Isolated human fat cells were also studied (121), and the lipolytic effects of epinephrine and growth hormone were observed. In contrast to rat fat cells, ACTH was not effective in human fat cells (121), although the molecular mechanism accounting for this difference was not identified. PGE₁ and adenosine antagonized the norepinephrine-induced release of glycerol and free fatty acids in human fat cell preparations, while the \(N^6\)-2′-O-dibutyryl derivative of cAMP stimulated lipolysis.

The technique was expanded to isolate brown fat cells from the dorsal interscapular brown fat pad of the rat (101). Epinephrine stimulated free fatty acid and glycerol release in a similar way in brown and white fat cells, and epinephrine also stimulated O₂ consumption. Brown fat cells utilized more free glycerol for the reesterification of fatty acids than did white fat cells; this is explained by the high glycerokinase activity in brown fat cells. It was shown later that glycerokinase expression and activity are enhanced by cold exposure of the animals and SNS activation (106, 107).

Optimization of the use of isolated fat cells. Preparations of isolated fat cells have been extensively used since the pioneering studies of Rodbell (283–287) and Fain (93). It was soon noted that there was marked variability in the metabolic results obtained between laboratories and within the same laboratory from experiment to experiment. The method of isolation using collagenase presents some disadvantages because of poorly controlled contaminating protease activity in the collagenase batches. Modifications to the initial method to circumvent or limit the collagenase-related side effects were proposed (28, 264). The monitoring of insulin-dependent effects (i.e., stimulation of glucose influx or metabolism) seemed to be a rapid, sensitive, and accurate means to validate the isolation technique and the potential side effects of inconsistent enzyme preparations. Striking disparities (e.g., 30- to ≤3-fold stimulation) have been reported in the lipolytic responsiveness of isolated fat cells, and some fat cell batches were completely unresponsive to insulin. Several investigators have tried to unravel the reasons for such a large variability excluding collagenase properties.

First, the density of isolated fat cells in a given incubation volume focused the attention of investigators. The concentration of adipocytes was shown to have a striking effect on the rates of fat cell metabolism: an increase in the adipocyte concentration resulted in lower rates of lipolysis. Adenosine is released by fat cells in the incubation medium in amounts that inhibit hormone-induced lipolysis and cAMP accumulation (85, 313). The inclusion of adenosine deaminase in the incubation buffer of fat cells enhanced cAMP accumulation and lipolysis, a result supporting the importance of adenosine (103, 312), which was shown to interfere with the effects of insulin. Weak effects of insulin on epinephrine-induced lipolysis were observed when diluted fat cell suspensions were used, and the inclusion of adenosine enhanced the insulin effect (85, 310). The antilipolytic effect of insulin is abolished at high cellular levels of cAMP elicited by hormones in the absence of adenosine. The addition of adenosine enhanced the effects of insulin on glucose oxidation and lipolysis in fat cells (314).

After these early observations, requirements for the handling and manipulation of isolated rodent adipocytes were proposed (230). Lipolysis was measured by evaluation of the –cAMP-

to-+cAMP activity ratios of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (A-kinase) in fat cell extracts, which were used as an index of cellular cAMP concentrations. Several important points were established. In freshly prepared adipocytes, a wide range of A-kinase activity ratios immediately following their isolation were related to strikingly different basal lipolytic rates. Given that adenosine appears in adipocyte suspensions, the idea of working in an adenosine-free medium was tested. Adenosine removal with adenosine deaminase promoted a strong increase of spontaneous lipolytic rate, bringing obvious difficulties in examining the action of lipolytic hormones. Addition of adenosine deaminase to all media in which adipocytes were digested, washed, and suspended greatly reduced fat cell lysis and provided highly predictable day-to-day results (169, 170). In earlier studies, there was no attention to cell concentrations in the assay systems or to the shaking of incubation flasks, although various metabolites accumulating in the incubation buffer were known to alter cAMP production, lipolysis (i.e., fatty acids, lactate, and β-hydroxybutyrate) (102), and fatty acid reesterification (86). Optimal shaking provides a greater mixing of the fatty acids with the bovine serum albumin, which binds and neutralizes the fatty acids in the incubation buffer; it is a function of the geometry of the incubation tubes and the volume of the incubation medium. The most efficient way to normalize lipolysis data is to define the cell density at the beginning of the metabolic incubations (108). The optimized conditions required for measuring lipolysis in murine primary adipocytes were extensively reconsidered in detail in 2006. It is clearly established that adenosine management is of paramount importance in evaluating the lipolytic responsiveness of fat cells under basal and stimulated conditions. Low fatty acid concentrations are obtained using low adipocyte concentrations, and the usual defatted bovine serum albumin concentration [i.e., 3% (wt/vol)] in the assay medium is sufficient to bind all the fatty acids. Viswanadha and Londos (376) reported that adipocyte concentrations in the range 10,000–15,000 cells per milliliter produce optimized conditions for lipolytic assays. The conditions they describe merit the attention of today’s investigators who have forgotten previous studies, since it enables comparisons of the optimized conditions for human and rodent mature adipocyte responsiveness to a wide range of lipolytic and antilipolytic agents. It is also important for all the investigators collecting adipocyte-conditioned media or coculturing adipocytes with other cell types.

Adipocytes have been used more recently in cocultures to obtain an insight into the cross talk between different cell types. For instance, cross talk between adipocytes and myocytes, neurons, or hepatocytes has been investigated successfully. The release of fat cell factors induces insulin resistance in human skeletal muscle cells (81). In hepatocytes, fat cells may induce insulin resistance, and this process appears to be mediated by TNF-α and IL-6 (381). Adipocyte-derived factor(s) has also been shown to upregulate the secretion of neuropeptide Y (NPY) by sympathetic neurons (365). Coculture systems have been expanded to the cell types existing inside the adipose tissue mass, and they have been very useful to reveal the functions of various adipokines (9).

The average size of fat cells and the size distribution vary among fat depots and inside a given depot; mesenteric adipocytes are smaller than adipocytes in other regions. Marked regional differences in white adipose tissue metabolism have

been reported, and results have been reviewed several times (179, 206, 221). For instance, mesenteric fat cells have the highest rates of glucose metabolism and lactate production in rodents (82). In humans, visceral adipocytes are less sensitive to the effect of insulin on glucose utilization (408) but are more responsive to a lipolytic challenge (242). Adipocytes do not have an unlimited capacity for expansion, and it was suggested that a “maximum fat cell size” might exist (222). Faust and co-workers (104) advanced the idea that the achievement of a specific mean fat cell size (i.e., a critical level of fat cell hypertrophy) triggers a subsequent increase in adipocyte number. Although proposed 20 years ago, “the critical fat cell size hypothesis” has not been explored sufficiently. Triggering factors involved in the initiation of this process are poorly known, although some have been proposed (154, 370). Another question concerns the heterogeneity of adipocytes inside a single fat deposit; size heterogeneity is present and may be a result of differential effects on adipocytes. Are large and small adipocytes equivalent? There may be distinctive differences in cell position within the fine architecture of the adipose tissue (e.g., neural innervation and vascular bed extent). The separation of adipocytes according to their size appeared necessary to some investigators. A method of separation of adipocytes according to cell volume and based on their relative densities was proposed and provided interesting results on adipocyte heterogeneity in adipokine secretion according to fat cell size (180, 325). Excessive adipocyte hypertrophy consecutive to surplus of nutrients could lead to overload of the ER. Perturbation of ER homeostasis leads to stress and to activation of the unfolded protein response. Chronic activation of ER stress has been shown to have an important role in inflammation and insulin resistance (171, 296). The mechanisms leading to chronic ER stress in adipocytes are not understood, but hypertrophy-induced “sickness” of adipocytes will be an important center of interest in the near future.

The manipulation of mature isolated fat cells is not easy in long-term culture (see Adipogenic Cells: Freshly Isolated Cells, Primary Cell Lines, and Established Preadipose Cell Lines. Explant culture and culture of freshly isolated mature fat cells), and major limitations appeared when investigators planned to introduce DNA fragments into mature adipocytes. Adipocytes differentiated in vitro from fat cell precursors are often preferred for such purposes. Nevertheless, electroporation, which offers certain advantages over other somatic gene transfer techniques such as viral vectors, has been adapted as a technique for introducing foreign macromolecules, such as DNA, into cells directly in fat pads in vivo. It is a useful method for lineage tracing and analysis of signaling pathways. Mature adipocytes have been shown to be susceptible to electroporation. A selective electroporation of adipocytes, directly within adipose tissue, has also been described (138).

From fat cell isolation to fat cell sizing. Because of the increasing importance of the metabolic role of adipose tissue, methods for evaluating physiological or pathological conditions that modify the fat mass become of major interest. The evaluation of adipose tissue cellularity requires the concomitant measurement of fat cell number and fat cell size in a given fat pad.

The very early attempts at fat cell sizing were done microscopically on histological preparations or by determination of fat pad DNA (32, 131, 222, 263, 272, 324). The methods for

the direct optical determination of fat cell size were tedious and nonautomatic and do not enable storage of samples. From fat cell diameter determined using light microscopy, the mean fat cell volume and lipid content could be determined mathematically (324). DNA measurement on the intact adipose tissue provides an inexact estimate because of the presence of numerous nonadipose cells in the SVF of the tissue. After the development of the fat cell isolation method, an automated method of fat cell sizing able to provide estimates for mean cell size and the variance of the cell size distribution was described using adipose tissues from various anatomic locations in young rodents and from human samples obtained from the subcutaneous fat depot by needle aspiration. Isolated fat cells were fixed with osmium tetroxide, and a Coulter counter was used to count the cells in a suspension derived from a known amount of tissue (159). Transformation of the volume distribution to diameters showed that cell diameters appeared to be normally distributed. A simpler technique including cell isolation and methylene blue staining of fat cells, with diameter measurements, was also proposed (79). These previous techniques for the sizing of adipocytes are often complicated and time-consuming. A comparison of mean cell sizes of specimens of human adipose tissue determined on sectioned slices or on isolated fat cells revealed that the collagenase method may be used for morphological studies of human adipose tissue. Nevertheless, after the collagenase procedure, the cell diameter must be determined immediately, because storage of fat cell suspensions can affect cell morphology in the long term (332). More recently, computerized determinations of adipocyte size have been introduced. A rapid, automated, and reliable method for fat cell sizing from digital images using a customized program from the Mayo Clinic (AdCount) has been developed (357). Another computerized method allowing the assessment of a sufficient number of cells to obtain reliable data on size distribution and storage of images of cell preparations has also been described recently (29). This technique is rapid and allows the study of subtle variations in the size distribution of fat cells from adipose tissue biopsies. Moreover, the convenient storage of images is also an important advantage for further utilization in long-term clinical protocols.

In addition to quantifying cells on excised adipose tissue batches, one recent method was developed to establish the dynamics within the apparently stable population of adipocytes observed in adult humans. Adipocyte turnover was evaluated by analysis of the integration into genomic DNA of fat cells of ¹⁴C derived from nuclear bomb tests. It showed that ~10% of fat cells are renewed annually at all adult ages and at various levels of body mass index. Neither adipocyte death nor appearance rate is altered in early-onset obesity. These results suggest a tight regulation of fat cell number in this condition during adulthood (334), although possible mechanisms were not proposed and probably require more thorough investigations.

Purification fat cell plasma membranes: an essential step toward biophysical and biochemical investigations of plasma membrane properties. An initial procedure was described by Rodbell (287, 291) to obtain crude plasma membranes preparations. Fat cell “ghosts” were obtained after treatment of isolated rat fat cells with an isotonic or hypotonic saline solution. Ghosts consist of sacs of plasma membranes associated with ER, Golgi, mitochondrial, and other vesicular components and enzymes of fat cells. They possess the necessary asymmetry-of-membrane relationship between the external and internal environment, as in the case of intact cells; the effects of insulin and other hormones are preserved. However, because of the need for purified plasma membranes, it soon became obvious that separation of plasma membranes from all the other membranes in fat cell ghosts was essential. Most of the procedures involved in the fractionation of adipocyte ghosts into purified components used a combination of differential and gradient centrifugation. Many authors have published improvements of the original technique described by McKeel and Jarett (243) to further the aims of simplicity, rapidity, yield, purity, and functional integrity (14, 177, 191, 216, 224, 225). The isolation of fat cells has been shown to cause a decrease in the specific activity of the plasma membrane enzymes (128). A technique based on the separation of the plasma membranes from mitochondria and reticulum moieties in a self-forming gradient appeared to be a rapid and significantly improved method for adipocyte plasma membrane preparations (21). The absence of contamination and purity of the adipocyte plasma membranes was assessed by the activity marker enzymes (i.e., 5′-nucleotidase, adenylyl cyclase, and Na⁺-K⁺-ATPase). An innovative and rapid method based on coating fat cells with rabbit anti-rat erythrocyte antibodies and followed by immunoprecipitation of the coated membranes was also proposed. This technique, which utilized mild preparative conditions favoring preservation of membrane properties, was rapid compared with density-gradient ultracentrifugation, although it was not extensively used (233). An improvement in the purification procedures of fat cell plasma membranes has been an essential step in fat cell biology (210). The availability of purified plasma membrane preparations has acted as an important impetus for attempts to isolate and study miscellaneous enzymes, receptors, and transport systems in fat cells. Isolation techniques based on the use of selected detergents and immunoisolation methods have been refined to define the plasma membrane domains and membrane dynamics. As an example, glucose transporters and caveolae were isolated from primary adipocytes after isolation, homogenization, and fractionation by immunoisolation (323, 333).

Adipogenic Cells: Freshly Isolated Cells, Primary Cell Lines, and Established Preadipose Cell Lines

Various attempts have been made to keep viable adipose tissue explants and isolated mature fat cells in in vitro cultures; they cannot be used for long-term cultures. One of the most dramatic developments in research into adipose tissue at the cellular level was the identification of a fat cell precursor. Early morphological observations of “empty cells” in developing adipose tissue were the first indications that “preadipocytes” could be an important cellular entity in adipose tissue (251). Several in vitro models offered invaluable benefits in determining the mechanisms of adipocyte development (i.e., identification of external modulators of proliferation/differentiation and coordinated transcriptional control of adipocyte gene expression during differentiation).

Explant culture and culture of freshly isolated mature fat cells. The first strategy used for maintaining adipose cells in culture was based on the use of a limited number of adipose tissue explants in an incubation flask (91, 328, 331). As long as the explants were small enough (i.e., 1-mm³ pieces) to allow

C334 HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVES IN FAT CELL BIOLOGY

adequate diffusion of nutrients, they could be maintained with appropriate morphology and responsiveness to study longer-duration (24–48 h) effects of hormones. The major drawback is that hypoxic areas exist in such culture conditions, and adipose explants contain several types of cells besides adipocytes (i.e., endothelial cells, fibroblasts, immune cells, and preadipocytes) that could introduce complex interfering effects. Moreover, the cellular make-up of the explants could be modified in the long term, if proliferation of other cell types occurs. Whatever the limitations of the explant culture system, it could provide interesting conditions in a setting resembling more closely different in vivo situations. The system was recently used to analyze depot-dependent effects of adipose tissue explants on cocultured hepatocytes (83). There has been a renewed interest in adipose tissue explants to study adipose tissue secretome (9, 165) and to perform ex vivo angiogenesis assays in adipose tissue (126).

At first glance, the establishment of a cell culture system of mature fat cells provides homogeneity of target cells and seems to be a prerequisite to study the long-term events of fat cell biology and metabolism and to obtain an eventual hypertrophic development of the cells (a very specific property of the adipocyte). Unfortunately, limitations appeared quite rapidly. Mature isolated fat cells do not attach to the bottom of cell culture dishes. Because of their high lipid content, they float on the top of the culture medium. It soon became obvious that mature isolated fat cells had a short lifetime in suspension, which is a major problem that invalidates their use for long-term measurements. Isolated adipocytes in suspension in an appropriate culture medium maintained \[^{3}\]H\]leucine incorporation into proteins and remained impermeable to \[L-\^{3}H\]glucose and trypan blue for ≥48 h, but survival and function were profoundly altered after this period (238). The primary culture of isolated adipocytes in suspension in a culture medium has been used to reveal insulin-mediated changes in plasma membrane receptors. The rapid endocytosis of insulin-insulin receptor complexes in the presence of insulin and the upregulation of insulin receptors in the absence of insulin were described using this technique (124, 239). Recently, total internal reflection fluorescence was used to visualize the dynamic behavior of glucose transporter-bearing vesicles near the plasma membrane of mature rat adipocytes (228). Emerging live microscopy methods have opened up innovative explorations of fat cells.

To improve culture conditions, some other methods have been proposed. A “ceiling culture,” whereby isolated fat cells were incubated in completely medium-filled flasks and adhered to the upper surface of the flask, was proposed. Unfortunately, the cells underwent rapid fat loss and became multilocular and fibroblast-like, with rapid dedifferentiation (340, 341). Since the 1970s, collagen matrices have been developed for the in vitro study of various cells (88, 89). The behavior of unilocular mature fat cells in a collagen matrix has been examined in terms of cell function and proliferation. The concept raised in the studies that reported proliferation of defatted fat cells was contested (342). It seems that the adipocyte dedifferentiation that occurs in media supporting adipocyte function and commonly used for explants and later for fat cell precursor studies is an artifact of the culture technique, rather than a physiological response. Proliferative events observed in such conditions were probably related, at least in part, to the presence of fat cell precursors that adhered to mature adipocytes and were able to proliferate and differentiate after the dedifferentiation of mature fat cells.

Despite the difficulties involved in maintaining functional isolated fat cells for long-term studies in culture conditions, strategies were developed to obtain mature adipocytes (or, at least, adipocytes in a sufficiently differentiated state) by using adipocyte precursor cells isolated from adipose tissue, fibroblast-like preadipocyte cell lines, and even pluripotent stem cells. Not all the aspects can be considered exhaustively here, but the value and limitations of the various cell systems are discussed. Two major cell culture models are available: 1) preadipocyte cell lines that are already committed toward the adipocyte lineage and 2) multipotent stem cell lines that are able to undergo commitment to adipocytes, chondrocytes, and myocytes.

**Preadipocyte cell lines.** Studies on multipotent clonal cell lines have suggested that the adipocyte lineage derives from an embryonic stem cell precursor with the capacity to differentiate into the mesodermal cell types. The cells of preadipocyte cell lines are morphologically similar to fibroblast-like “preadipose” cells in the stroma of adipose tissue. Preadipose cell lines are already committed solely to the adipocyte lineage, although they may represent different stages of adipocyte development. They represent a late stage of adipocyte development at which cells have undergone commitment to the adipocyte lineage (i.e., acquisition of the adipocyte phenotype by chronological changes in the expression of numerous genes reflected by the appearance of early, intermediate, and late mRNA/protein markers and triglyceride accumulation). They made it possible to investigate, under controlled conditions, the adipocyte differentiation program of fat cells in culture. When treated with appropriate hormonal and pharmacological agents, they can only differentiate into adipocytes. The most widely studied cell models for preadipocyte differentiation are the 3T3-L1 and the 3T3-F442A cell lines (Table 2).

**3T3-L1 AND 3T3-F442A PREADIPOCYTES.** Selected clones of the original fibroblast stock derived from 17- to 19-day-old Swiss 3T3 mouse embryos were able to convert to adipose cells in culture. Culture conditions have been optimized by Green et al. (139, 141, 142); a number of seminal studies concerning the various events appearing during the time course of differentiation of these cells have also been published by Green et al. The probability of such a conversion of 3T3 clones varies greatly among the different clones. Once the conversion takes place, the adipose cells produced from the clones appear similar. Cells of the established preadipose line 3T3-L1 that enter a resting state accumulate triglyceride and convert to adipose cells characterized by a large increase in the rate of triglyceride synthesis measured by the incorporation of labeled palmitate, acetate, and glucose. After growth arrest at confluence, 3T3-L1 preadipocytes receiving an appropriate combination of mitogenic and adipogenic signals undergo at least one round of DNA replication and cell doubling. This has been proposed to lead to the clonal expansion of committed cells before expression of genes leading to the adipocyte phenotype. More recently, clonal expansion was validated as a prerequisite for differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes into adipocytes (348). Clones with a high susceptibility to adipose conversion (i.e., 3T3-F442A) were isolated, as were 3T3-C2 clones, which have the lowest susceptibility and are often used as control

Detailed procedures for stroma-vascular cell fractionation and for culture treatment to reach confluence and adipogenic induction are found in the corresponding references. Whatever the various cell lines available, adipocytes differentiated in culture are capable of filling with lipid but may not be considered to be fully differentiated (e.g., adipocytes with multiple lipid droplets but unable to build up the unique large droplet characteristic of mature adipocytes; inability to undergo noticeable hypertrophy in vitro). Committed preadipocyte cell lines have been quite useful in identification of key molecular markers and transcription factors of the adipocyte; they are also commonly used to assess adipogenic potential of various chemical and pharmacological agents. Noncommitted cells with adipogenic potential are useful to investigate very early events of mammalian adipocyte differentiation. Primary cultures from stroma-vascular cells originate from a mixture of cell types present in the adipose tissue stroma-vascular fraction (SVF). Cell surface markers were used more recently to refine selection of fat cell progenitors. Induction of differentiation is variable according to species, location of adipose tissue depots, and age of the donor. There are limited possibilities for subculturing and a rapid decline in the ability to differentiate. Primary human preadipocytes can be purchased from several companies.

fibroblasts. 3T3-F442A cells are considered to be a model with a more advanced commitment in the adipose differentiation process (143). Susceptibility to the adipose conversion is transmitted heritably within each clone of 3T3 cells (141). During the adipose differentiation, the 3T3-F442A cells lose their fibroblast morphology and round up, probably because of changes in the expression of cytoskeletal and extracellular proteins involved in matrix formation. Electron-micrographic analysis of the ultrastructure of 3T3-L1 adipocytes reveals strong similarities to adipocytes observed in vivo (54, 256). The rate of appearance and extent of cytoplasmic accumulation of triacylglycerol in multiple lipid droplets stainable with Oil Red O were often used as criteria of differentiation; coalescence of droplets occurs after longer periods in culture. Inducers of adipocyte differentiation have been extensively studied, and a number of factors have been used to test their efficacy as

Cortisol; Dex, dexamethasone (a glucocorticoid); HS, horse serum; IGF-I, insulin-like growth factor I; Ins, insulin; TZD, thiazolidinedione (rosiglitazone or other PPARγ ligand); T₃, 3,3',5-triiodothyronine; WAT, white adipose tissue.

Historical Perspectives

C336 HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVES IN FAT CELL BIOLOGY

inducers or inhibitors of adipocyte differentiation. The serum- containing medium used in the pioneering studies is less efficient than a defined culture medium for adipocyte differentiation (309). Three signaling pathways are necessary for a full induction of adipocyte differentiation: the insulin-like growth factor I-activated tyrosine kinase pathway, the glucocorticoid pathway, and the cAMP-dependent protein kinase pathway (58). 3T3-L1 and 3T3-F442A cells are often thought to be immortalized, although their capacities to differentiate into adipocytes are known to decline with the increase in the number of passages.

During differentiation, there is an increase in the expression of most adipocyte proteins that is largely the result of coordinate transcriptional activation of adipocyte-specific genes and silencing of preadipocyte genes. Plasma membrane proteins undergo striking changes; e.g., caveolae that are particularly abundant in rat adipocytes increase dramatically in number when 3T3-L1 preadipocytes differentiate into mature adipocytes and become insulin responsive. Caveolae are 25- to 150-nm invaginations of the plasma membrane that are found in most cell types and require cholesterol and sphingolipids, together with the principal structural protein caveolin, to assemble. They are involved in numerous cellular processes, such as receptor-mediated uptake, receptor-mediated signaling, and vesicular trafficking. Many of the key players in mitotic clonal expansion (MCE) and the adipocyte terminal differentiation program have been extensively characterized by utilization of 3T3-L1 and 3T3-F442A preadipocyte cell lines (58, 236, 297, 298). Briefly, hormonal induction of growth-arrested 3T3-L1 preadipocytes rapidly activates expression of CCAAT/ enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP)-β. Acquisition of DNA- binding activity by C/EBPβ, however, is delayed until the cells synchronously enter the S phase of MCE. After MCE, C/EBPβ activates expression of C/EBPα and peroxisome proliferator- activated receptors (PPAR)-δ and -γ, which then transcriptionally activate genes that give rise to the adipocyte phenotype. MCE and adipogenesis are dependent on C/EBPβ (405). In addition, 3T3-L1 differentiation was studied using combined proteomic and genomic strategies. A huge increase in the expression and/or abundance of numerous mitochondrial proteins was detected in vitro in differentiating 3T3-L1 preadipocytes within 4 days after induction of the differentiation program. The mitochondrial biogenesis was sustained for up to 10 days. The increase in the basal rate of O₂ consumption is a clear manifestation of an increased mitochondrial biogenesis. The mitochondria might play a critical role in lipogenesis by providing key intermediates for the synthesis of triglycerides; increases in expression of proteins involved in fatty acid metabolism and mitochondrial chaperones were observed (394).

These cells have proven to be reliable in vitro models, which, in addition to triglyceride storage, develop a good responsiveness to lipogenic and lipolytic factors. Compared with primary cells isolated from adipose tissue (see Adipogenic Cells: Freshly Isolated Cells, Primary Cell Lines, and Established Preadipose Cell Lines. Adipocyte precursors isolated from the SVF of adipose tissues and de novo generation of white adipocytes), which are diploid and, therefore, may reflect the in vivo context, aneuploid cell lines have been shown to lead to acquisition of an adipose cell phenotype by a similar mechanism in vivo. The most compelling validation of the

3T3-L1 preadipocyte models is provided by transplantation studies. When implanted subcutaneously into athymic mice at an anatomic site devoid of adipose tissue, the 3T3-F442A preadipocytes differentiated (140, 236), and within few weeks, fat pads developed at the site of injection. The same process was also observed when genetically modified 3T3-L1 cells were implanted (300). The fat pads contained mature adipocytes that were not histologically different from those in a normal fat pad. A more recent study showed that when 3T3-F442A preadipocytes were implanted subcutaneously into athymic Balb/c nude mice, the cells developed into highly vascularized fat pads over the next 14–21 days and were morphologically similar to normal subcutaneous adipose tissue. Histological studies showed that a new microvasculature and the expression of endothelial cell markers and adipogenesis markers increased in parallel during fat pad development (253).

Both preadipose cell lines have been extensively used by a large number of investigators; they are still in abundant use to answer questions whenever the mature adipocyte cannot be utilized. Chronological changes in metabolism and functions of 3T3-L1 cultured adipocytes have revealed some aspects of the aging process of 3T3-L1 cells in culture. Adipocyte aging was investigated 10–20 days after the postinduction day of the cells. Although triglyceride-storing capacities are preserved during adipocyte aging, aged adipocytes have decreased glucose uptake and fuel consumption and show impaired fatty acid reesterification; they became more metabolically inert and insulin-resistant, with a reduced expression of leptin and adiponectin (402). The average half-life of adipocytes is considerably longer in vivo than in culture (334). Future investigations would require careful monitoring and characterization of the adipocyte aging process to validate the putative relevance of this cell system.

A limitation of the use of 3T3-L1 cells was their inability to be transduced by adenovirus. Methods have been designed to enhance transduction of 3T3-L1 cells by adenovirus. Polylysine-mediated enhancement was revealed as a promising method; it permitted up to 100% of cells to be transduced and did not inhibit differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells (260). A3T3-L1 adipocyte cell line stably expressing the truncated receptor for coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CARΔ1) was developed for its ability to be infected with adenovirus at a low multiplicity of infection. 3T3-L1 CARΔ1 cells are transduced 100-fold more efficiently than the parental 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Functional assays revealed that 3T3-L1 CARΔ1 adipocytes are virtually indistinguishable from their parental cells when insulin receptor expression, insulin-mediated pathways, stimulation of glucose uptake by insulin, and adiponectin secretion are considered (259, 299). A high-efficiency lipid-based introduction of small interfering RNA into differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes has been reported recently (192). Moreover, after screening of a 3T3-F442A library and identification of the gene for adipocyte lipid-binding protein, adipocyte P2 (aP2, also known as FABP4), a functional adipose-specific enhancer, was described by Ross et al. (301). It has been shown to be a useful tool able to direct high levels of expression to adipose tissue in vitro and in vivo. This element can be used to alter levels of endogenous genes to better understand their role. It is a tool extensively used for adipocyte research.

HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVES IN FAT CELL BIOLOGY

OB17 AND OB17-DERIVED CELL LINES. The ob17 cell line was derived from the adipocyte fraction of epididymal fat pads from the genetically obese C57BL/6J *ob/ob* mouse (254). Cells were cultured after a dedifferentiation phase, and the ob17 clone was selected on the basis of good contact inhibition and a high frequency of differentiation to adipose cells in the resting state. The ob17 line possesses a heterogeneous chromosome number (e.g., 35–44 chromosomes) and expresses the characteristic H2-LA antigen. The differentiation program becomes operative when growth is arrested. The cells, which accumulate triacylglycerols in lipid droplets, become responsive to insulin and lipolytic factors (254). The ob17 cell line represents an original model from a known cellular origin from the genetically obese mouse and could confer properties different from those of other murine cell lines (i.e., 3T3-L1 and 3T3-F442A). The properties of this model have been extensively studied by Ailhaud and co-workers. Various subclones of ob17 cells have been described; e.g., the Ob1771 line has been selected for its propensity to adiposity. Ob1771 preadipocytes can differentiate in a serum-free medium containing insulin, triiodothyronine, growth hormone, glucocorticoids, and agents that increase the intracellular cAMP concentration. Mutant clones of ob17 preadipose cells resistant to the cytotoxic action of ouabain have been isolated (ob17-OR11 clone). When injected subcutaneously into athymic mice, they gave rise in vivo to a fat pad containing ouabain-resistant mature adipocytes. Therefore, the ob17-OR11 clone should be a useful tool to distinguish in vivo between intrinsic and extrinsic factors involved in the differentiation of adipose precursor cells (119). This improved culture system offered the opportunity to characterize adipogenic and antiadipogenic factors and hormonal responses within physiological concentrations (Table 2).

Multipotent stem cell lines. C3H10T1/2 CELL LINE. The C3H10T1/2 cell line was established in 1973 from 14- to 17-day-old C3H mouse embryos (278). These cells have a fibroblast morphology in culture and are quite similar to mesenchymal stem cells. Treatment of these mouse embryo fibroblasts with 5′-azacytidine, a nucleoside analog that inhibits mammalian DNA methylation, leads to the appearance of new cell types that are morphologically and biochemically stable (266). Hypomethylation and the concomitant activation of a few regulatory genes appear sufficient to commit these cells to a specific lineage. These cells of mesodermal origin include myoblasts, adipocytes, and chondrocytes. Adipocytes have a morphology typical of multilocular fat cells and can be stained with Oil Red O, accumulate triglycerides, and express two lipogenic enzymes (353). Later, several adipogenic cell lines with an adipocyte phenotype, such as the TA1 clone, were isolated. Treatment of TA1 cells with insulin and the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone leads to an acceleration of the phenotypic changes observed during adipogenesis. Enzymatic activities typical of mature adipocytes were measured. Glycero-phosphate dehydrogenase increased 100-fold and lipoprotein lipase could be detected immunologically in adipocytes derived from C3H10T1/2 cells treated with 5′-azacytidine (50).

More recently, it was shown that bone morphogenetic protein-4 (BMP4), a member of the transforming growth factor-β superfamily, can induce the commitment of C3H10T1/2 cells to preadipocytes. The cells could develop into adipocytes when subjected to the currently used 3T3-L1 preadipocyte differentiation protocol at growth arrest in vitro. The cells synchronously enter the S phase and undergo MCE, a hallmark of preadipocyte differentiation; upon exiting the cell cycle, these cells express adipocyte markers. Another important observation confirmed the value of this cell model. C3H10T1/2 cells treated in vitro with BMP4 in cell culture and implanted subcutaneously into athymic mice developed into an adipose fat pad indistinguishable from a normal fat depot. This result suggests that BMP4 is able to specifically trigger the commitment of the pluripotent C3H10T1/2 stem cells to the adipocyte lineage (36, 347). Other factors, including Wnt signaling, cell density, and cell shape, also play a role in lineage commitment (262). It remains to be established whether this cell model is more relevant than the usual 3T3-L1 preadipocyte cells, since, after the triggering effect of BMP4 treatment, the adipogenic procedures to initiate adipogenesis are similar. Is BMP4 a universal adipogenic cue, or is it limited to C3H10T1/2 stem cell commitment? The cells responsive to BMP4 action in adipose tissue should be determined, and the in vivo mechanisms of BMP signaling remain to be established (37). Several other cell lines, including CHEF/18, Balb/c3T3, RCJ 3.1, and 1246 cells, have also been shown to possess stem cell characteristics and to be responsive to hypomethylation treatment for commitment initiation (143).

HUMAN MULTIPOTENT ADIPOSE-DERIVED STEM CELLS. A human multipotent adipose-derived stem (MADS) cell population was isolated from the adipose tissue of young donors (1 mo–7 yr old) and established in culture. The cells maintained their characteristics with long-term passaging; they have an indefinite lifespan. Human MADS cells display a normal karyotype; have active telomerase; proliferate >200 population doublings; and differentiate into adipocytes, osteoblasts, and myoblasts. Human MADS cells were characterized by flow cytometry analysis, which indicated that the cells are CD44⁺, CD49b⁺, CD105⁺, CD90⁺, CD13⁺, Stro-1⁻, CD34⁻, CD15⁻, CD117⁻, Flk-1⁻, gly-A⁻, CD133⁻, HLA-DR⁻, and HLA-Ilow. When differentiated into adipocytes, the cells show a lipolytic system similar to that reported in human mature adipocytes (e.g., functional β₁/β₂-adrenergic receptors and atrial natriuretic peptide receptors and responses to lipolytic hormones) and secrete leptin and adiponectin. Human MADS cells are able to form not only white adipocytes, but also functional brown adipocytes, in vitro (87). Global analysis of micro-RNAs (miRNAs) by high-throughput sequencing during adipogenesis of human MADS cells has identified a highly adipocyte-specific miRNA (miR-642a-3p) and revealed that the miR-30 family, which was upregulated during adipogenic differentiation, may play a central role in adipocyte development. Both miR-30a and miR-30d downregulate the transcription factor RUNX2 (an osteogenesis regulator) and contribute to adipogenic differentiation of human MADS cells (404). Human MADS cells represent a novel and promising tool to study human adipose tissue development and metabolism compared with the human cell lines previously described (i.e., PAZ6 preadipocytes and human mesenchymal stem cells) (294).

Human MADS cells are able to differentiate into various mesenchymal lineages, including adipocytes and osteoblasts, as well as to support in vivo regenerative processes. Compared with the other preadipocyte cell lines, an important feature of differentiated human MADS cells is their ability to secrete leptin and adiponectin, making them a valuable pharmacological tool.

ical tool to modulate the release of these metabolically important adipokines. Moreover, transplantation of human MADS cells into the *mdx* mouse, an animal model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, results in substantial expression of human dystrophin in the injected tibialis anterior and the adjacent gastrocnemius muscle. Long-term engraftment of human MADS cells takes place in nonimmunocompromised animals (295).

EMBRYONIC STEM CELLS AS A MODEL SYSTEM TO STUDY EARLY EVENTS OF ADIPOGENESIS AND ADIPOCYTE DEVELOPMENT. It is only recently that embryonic origin of adipocyte lineage has retained attention, although noticeable progress has been made in understanding terminal differentiation of adipocyte progenitors. Analysis of large-scale gene expression profiles of rodent white adipose tissues has revealed noticeable depot-specific patterns of genes involved in embryonic development and pattern specification (i.e., homeobox and forkhead box families) (127). These differences were intrinsic and persisted during in vitro culture and differentiation. Similar depot-specific differences in expression of developmental genes were observed in human subcutaneous vs. visceral adipose tissue (127, 355). The identification of a consistent and rather uniform pattern of differentially expressed genes between the two fat depots using multiple array replicates opened new perspectives for future research on regional differences in adipose tissue biology (377). A recent review summarizes results from genetic and genomic studies that led to major insights in the developmental origin of adipocyte lineage (22).

Mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are proliferating pluripotent stem cells that derive from the inner cell mass of 3.5-day-old mouse blastocysts. Differentiation of mouse ESCs toward adipocyte lineage was reported for the first time in 1997 (74). Conditions to induce expansion and differentiation of mouse and human ESCs at high efficiency into adipocytes have been described (74, 227, 269). Early developing ESC-derived embryoid bodies must be treated with retinoic acid for a precise period of time. Retinoic acid could not be substituted by adipogenic hormones or by potent activators of PPARs. Retinoic acid treatment was followed by treatment with conventional adipogenic factors (e.g., insulin, triiodothyronine, and rosiglitazone). This mouse ESC system represents a useful model to discover the transcriptional network in the early steps of adipogenesis. Large-scale gene expression studies of mouse ESC adipogenesis revealed new original processes of adipocyte development. For example, it was demonstrated that adipocytes developing from retinoic acid-treated mouse ESCs derive from neuroectoderm/neural crests, rather than from the mesoderm (22, 23). Retinoic acid has also been shown to be necessary for the differentiation of cephalic neural crest cells into adipocytes in developing zebrafish embryos (226), a result consistent with the role of retinoic acid in mouse ESC adipogenesis. A promising strategy to obtain a new source of pluripotent stem cells was recently described. It was based on the reprogramming of human somatic cells by introduction of a set of transcription factors related to pluripotency to obtain induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells (346, 401). Human iPS cells established from human fibroblasts possess an adipogenic potential comparable to human ESCs (351). The establishment of an adipocyte differentiation system with human iPS cells should facilitate the study of very early stages of adipogenesis, which await further clarification. A fully defined xeno-free medium has been defined for the culture of human iPS cells. It has the potential to be further expanded for its use for establishment, expansion, and differentiation of various stem cell types (269).

Adipocyte precursors isolated from the SVF of adipose tissues and de novo generation of white adipocytes. Studies of cloned cell lines have revealed that two separate steps may be distinguished in adipocyte development: 1) the differentiation of a mesenchymal stem cell into a preadipocyte and 2) conversion of a preadipocyte into a mature fat cell. In cloned cell lines, adipose conversion depends on at least one postconfluent mitosis, possibly induced by insulin-like growth factors or by unknown mitogens. In parallel to investigations using clonal preadipose cell lines, various research groups focused their interest on dormant preadipocytes in the SVF of the adipose tissue of rodents and humans. Cell culture systems have proven to be valuable models for the study of the processes involved in the formation of new fat cells.

Soon after the early morphological observations of empty cells in developing adipose tissue (251), appreciation of their physiological significance was obtained using methods for labeling the DNA of developing adipocytes by radiolabeled thymidine administration in vivo (167, 244, 265). The first experiments demonstrated that adipose stromal cells matured into adipocytes in developing rats, although there was a need to clarify how these cells relate to preadipocytes. Explants of adipose tissues gave rise to migrating “fibroblast-like cells” (331). They replicated and differentiated into cells with the morphological and biochemical characteristics of fat cells and provided the first in vitro proof for the existence of stromal cells in rodent and human subcutaneous adipose tissues. All the details concerning the preliminary studies on rodent and adipocyte precursors up to 1985 have been reviewed (372). In vitro differentiation protocols have been developed to study differentiation of adipocyte precursors in the SVF of various species (i.e., rat, mouse, pig, cow, chicken, and human) and its regulation by hormones. Early studies were limited by the use of bovine fetal calf serum, which was a poorly defined and nonreproducible cocktail of components (30, 31). The definition of chemically defined serum-free culture medium represented important progress. Growth hormone, glucocorticoids, and insulin are needed for conversion (77, 78). The adipose conversion of preadipocytes originating from the SVF of adipose tissues from various species does not depend on postconfluent mitoses and needs only insulin and glucocorticoid hormones in physiological concentrations; detailed procedures are available in two reviews (143, 268). Primary cultures from stroma-vascular cells originate from a mixture of cell types in the adipose tissue SVF. Induction of differentiation varies with species, location of the adipose tissue depots, and age of the donor. Preadipocytes are characterized by limited possibilities of subcultures and a rapid (3–4 passages) decline in the ability to differentiate (Table 2). Hauner and colleagues (152, 326) carried out a number of studies to optimize the definition of the characteristics of human fat cell precursors originating from the SVF from subcutaneous adipose tissue samples. In addition to stimulating hormones, an increasing number of factors that inhibit the conversion process have also been detected, although the physiological function of some of these factors remains unclear. Moreover, the ability of the precursors to undergo conversion to adipose tissue was not stable and was

HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVES IN FAT CELL BIOLOGY

lost after repeated subculturing or seeding at low densities (152). The study of human preadipocytes is often hampered by the limited availability of adipose tissue and low yield of cell extraction. A novel technique based on utilization of a cocktail of growth factors was developed to propagate primary human preadipocytes without loss of differentiation capacity (326). Primary human preadipocytes can be purchased from several companies, but they exhibit a decline in their ability to differentiate. Given such results, the traditional belief was that new adipocytes appearing with the increase in the fat mass arose from a population of resident adipose tissue mesenchymal progenitor cells (i.e., preadipocyte progenitors) located in the SVF and maintained in a “dormant” state. The physiological and pathological determinants of their recruitment, as well as the processes controlling “dormancy,” remained poorly defined until recently. The ability of the adipose tissue pool of primary human preadipocytes to differentiate could be of interest to study the impact of in vivo treatments (e.g., hormonal or nutritional) on adipose tissue dynamics in physiological or pathological conditions.

**Localization and molecular signature of adipocyte progenitors.** Various recent studies have stimulated a renewed interest in the search and characterization of the native adipose stromal cells (ASCs) and the adipocyte precursors in the adult adipose tissue and the mechanisms explaining their presence in fat depots. A number of studies devoted to the characterization of ASCs have revealed disparate parameters concerning their nature, their tissue localization, and their comparison with bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (BM-MNCs). Similarities exist in cell immunophenotype between ASCs and BM-MNCs (76, 144). Furthermore, BM-MNCs are able to differentiate into adipocytes under adipogenic in vitro culture conditions (80, 304). ASCs in culture exhibit a profile of mesenchymal stem cell markers, such as the cell surface marker CD105, and the lack of expression of the cell surface marker CD34, shown to be restricted in adults to hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, as well as capillary endothelial cells (144, 220, 409). A CD34<sup>+</sup> cell population has been identified in the SVF of human adipose tissue (144, 245, 267). The stem cell-associated marker CD34 was at peak levels in the SVF cell batches and early passages, while reduced levels were observed in serial-passaged adipose-derived stem cells (247). Whether the downregulation of CD34 expression is an in vitro consequence or the result of a more committed phenotype than that observed during the differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells remains undefined (387).

An approach enabling the isolation of different cell populations in the SVF from human adipose tissue was developed using magnetic microbeads coupled to antibodies directed against the cell surface markers CD34, CD31 (marker for endothelial cells, monocyte macrophage lineage, and platelets), and CD14 (marker for the monocyte/macrophage lineage and the granulocytes). Among the different subsets of cells, the CD34<sup>+</sup>/CD31<sup>-</sup> cells were the unique cell fraction able to differentiate into adipocytes in the adipogenic culture conditions. The ability to differentiate into adipocytes was restricted to cells that did not express the mesenchymal stem cell marker CD105. Moreover, they did not respond to the culture conditions used for hematopoietic colony assays. In human fat deposits, the adipocyte progenitor cells are included in the CD34<sup>+</sup>/CD31<sup>-</sup> cell fraction, which displays features distinct from the adult mesenchymal and hematopoietic stem cells (318). The immunophenotype has yet to be fully characterized. Endothelial progenitor cells have been found in the same subset of the CD34<sup>+</sup>/CD31<sup>-</sup> cell population that also differentiates, in vitro, into endothelial cells and participates, in vivo, in the revascularization of the ischemic hindlimb in mice (245). Whether adipocytes and endothelial cells share a common precursor, as recently proposed (267), or possess different progenitors in the CD34<sup>+</sup>/CD31<sup>-</sup> cell population requires further investigation.

A reciprocal relationship exists between blood vessel development and adipogenesis (156, 255). Paracrine regulation of angiogenesis and adipocyte differentiation was shown during in vivo adipogenesis (118) in rodents. It is unclear if CD34<sup>+</sup>/CD31<sup>-</sup> cells represent the resident dormant progenitor pool, which has undergone some phenotypic changes when homing in fat depots. It cannot be excluded that they are cells of bone marrow origin, recruited into adipose tissue after docking to microvascular endothelial cells of the adipose tissue vasculature. After entering the extravascular domain of human adipose tissue, they could stay under the control of adipocyte and other SVF cell secretions and gain their specific preadipocyte phenotype. Crossno et al. (60) described a subpopulation of adipocytes that arises from bone marrow progenitor (BMP) cells, while another group believes that bone marrow-derived circulating progenitor cells play a negligible role in expanding the number of adipocytes in the growth of adipose tissues in adult rodents (194), although some technical limitations have been pinpointed. This proposed new mechanism to explain expansion in the number of adipocyte progenitors in response to nutritional and pharmacological challenges remains an open question. A recent study on de novo generation of white adipocytes has highlighted the nonresident origin for a subset of white adipocytes with a hematopoietic origin and a population of tissue-resident adipocyte progenitors with mesenchymal characteristics. This study demonstrated that hematopoietic progenitors generated BMP-derived adipocytes and adipocyte precursors via myeloid intermediates (234). The authors provided cytogenetic arguments to rule out fusion as a mechanism for the production of BMP-derived adipocytes. It is proposed that the generation of BMP-derived adipocytes from bone marrow hematopoietic cells represents a unique developmental pathway for the production of fat cells that involves transdifferentiation of myeloid intermediates (across lineage) to adipocytes. Another noticeable observation is the depot-specific accumulation of BMP-derived adipocytes, which could explain previous reports of the existence of distinct populations of adipocytes and preadipocytes in fat depots from different anatomical locations (355, 356). Further studies are needed to appreciate the true impact of BMP-derived adipocytes on adipose tissue development and function in humans.

Two recent studies in rodents have opened new avenues for the understanding of adipocyte formation in rodents and putative perspectives for improved characterization of adipocyte progenitors in humans. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting and various cell surface markers were used to isolate original cell populations, which were tested for their adipogenic potential. Surface markers were used to identify adipocyte progenitors as lin<sup>-</sup>/CD34<sup>+</sup>/CD29<sup>+</sup>/sca-1<sup>+</sup>/CD24<sup>+</sup> cells (293). Another group, using an approach of lineage tracing in mice, isolated undifferentiated cells, identified as CD45<sup>-</sup>/ter119<sup>-</sup>/CD34<sup>+</sup>/sca-1<sup>+</sup>.

HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVES IN FAT CELL BIOLOGY

These cells were shown to undergo adipogenesis in vitro and in vivo in nude mice. Moreover, these cells localize in the wall compartment of vessels of adipose tissue but are not dispersed in the stroma (349). In humans, a recent study has clarified the situation and shown that all ASCs are found in the SVF of human adipose tissue and express classical markers described for BM-MNCs. Interestingly, CD34 expression decreased during ASC culture and was negatively correlated with proliferation rate. Immunohistological analysis revealed that, in their native microenvironment, human ASCs exhibited specific morphological features with branched morphology, with lateral protrusions that could reach a length of 80 μm. Some cell branches could form a network surrounding mature adipocytes; functions remain unclear. They were found scattered in adipose tissue stroma and did not express in vivo pericytic markers, which appeared during the culture process. Finally, spontaneous commitment of ASCs to adipocyte lineage was enhanced in adipose tissue from obese humans (241).

Human ASCs have been used to prepare iPS cells. They represent a heterogeneous group of multipotent progenitor cells that can be obtained in very large quantities from a patient without extended time for expansion. They may possess a different genetic and epigenetic profile that is more adapted for reprogramming than the terminally differentiated fibroblast cells commonly used to obtain iPS cells. Human iPS cells can be generated from adult human ASCs in a feeder-free condition, eliminating the use of feeder cells (344). Detailed protocols for isolation, preparation, and transformation of ASCs from fat tissue to mouse iPS cells in feeder-free conditions and human iPS cells in feeder-dependent or feeder/xenobiotic-free conditions have been described recently (343).

**Human preadipocyte cell line (Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome cells)**. In contrast to freshly isolated preadipocytes from healthy control infants, which rapidly lose their capacity to differentiate after a few cell divisions in culture, a human cell strain providing a source of human preadipocytes with a high capacity for adipose differentiation was isolated from the cells of the SVF of the subcutaneous adipose tissue of an infant with Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome (SGBS), a rare X-linked disorder characterized by pre- and postnatal overgrowth. The molecular defect causing this syndrome is not known, although mutations of the glypican-3 gene, which is involved in the control of organ growth, has been identified. These SGBS cells are neither transformed nor immortalized, and they retain their potential to develop into adipocytes over ≥50 generations. Moreover, adipocyte differentiation could be induced under serum-free culture conditions. During the differentiation process, SGBS cells developed a gene expression pattern similar to that in differentiating human preadipocytes. Differentiated SGBS adipocytes showed increased glucose uptake upon insulin stimulation and glycerol release upon catecholamine exposure. SGBS adipocytes were morphologically, biochemically, and functionally identical to in vitro differentiated adipocytes from healthy subjects (379). This cell line has been used with success by various investigators interested in human adipocyte biology (~30 studies reviewed in Ref. 109). The exact molecular mechanism leading to the increased capacity to proliferate with unchanged ability to differentiate remains unknown.

Utilization of Isolated Fat Cells to Explore cAMP Production and the Properties of the Fat Cell Adenylyl Cyclase and Plasma Membrane

The isolated fat cell has been an important tool to decipher the mechanisms of action of various hormones at the cellular level. The pioneering studies are considered essentially (for deeper insights into adenylyl cyclase-dependent insulin pathways, see more recent reviews).

**Fat cells and the cAMP saga.** Tremendous advances in our insight into the mechanism of action of the hormones occurred between 1960 and 1975. The pioneering work of Sutherland and colleagues proposed an innovative new vista on hormone action; a number of black boxes were opened during this period. The fat cell has made a fundamental contribution to the discovery of the role of cAMP in the control of metabolic processes. Simultaneous measurements of the physiological response and intracellular cAMP in adipose tissue pads and isolated fat cells under hormonal stimulations have clearly defined the role of cAMP in diverse hormone actions in fat cells. By 1965, soon after the establishment of assay methods to directly determine cAMP in tissues and intact adipose cells, the findings of Sutherland and colleagues focused attention on the cardinal role of cAMP in the control of metabolic processes. Epinephrine rapidly increases intracellular cAMP levels and stimulates lipolysis. The cAMP analog N⁶-2′-O-dibutyryl-cAMP stimulated lipolysis in incubated fat pads and isolated fat cells (43). Insulin lowered intracellular cAMP levels in rat adipose tissue pads incubated with epinephrine alone or epinephrine with caffeine (44). Caffeine, an inhibitor of cAMP phosphodiesterase, acted synergistically with epinephrine to enhance cAMP production and lipolysis. A number of investigators have expanded these initial observations to other lipolytic agents and clearly established that the intracellular level of cAMP determined, at least in part, the rate of lipolysis and other metabolic responses in fat cells (41, 43, 44, 95, 182, 200). Temporal, quantitative and qualitative relationships among lipolytic and antilipolytic agents and cAMP levels have been carefully examined in isolated fat cells and expanded to various other lipolytic (e.g., catecholamines, ACTH, glucagon, luteinizing hormone, and thyroid-stimulating hormone) and antilipolytic (i.e., insulin, nicotinic acid, and PGE₁) factors. The increase in cAMP levels is an early event, as a significant increment of cAMP was detected within 30 s after stimulation, before any significant change in free fatty acid and glycerol release (41, 42). The study of the insulin effect on cAMP levels required a prestimulation of fat cells by lipolytic agents; inhibition was dependent on the extent of prestimulation (42, 98).

**Fat cell contribution to adenylyl cyclase studies.** Investigators with expertise in the use isolated fat cells became familiar with the concept of “the receptor” as being the initial site of action of hormones (Fig. 1). Their next step aimed at the delineation of the structural and functional components of the fat cell plasma membrane, looking for the putative existence of “receptors.” Fat cells contributed noticeably to the field. Rodbell described a procedure to obtain crude plasma membrane preparations. Fat cell ghosts enriched in plasma membranes were used to study the properties of fat cell adenylyl cyclase, the enzyme involved in cAMP production (287, 291). Some critical questions regarding hormone action on the enzyme were

Fig. 1. Concepts of the regulation of fat cell metabolism by the lipolytic hormones and insulin by the end of the 1970s. The 1978–1979 model for insulin action postulated that insulin binding to an effector system in the plasma membrane promoted independent effects on cAMP phosphodiesterase activity and cAMP levels, glucose transport, pyruvate dehydrogenase, and cGMP accumulation. Lipolysis is inhibited by insulin (72). Fast-acting lipolytic agents, such as catecholamines and ACTH, act via a receptor complex on adenylate cyclase. The cAMP formed from ATP by adenylate cyclase stimulation activates a protein kinase that phosphorylates inactive to active triglyceride lipase. Feedback regulation of lipolysis and cAMP accumulation is exerted through an elevation of intracellular free fatty acids (93). +, Activation; –, inhibition.

answered indirectly using these crude fat cell membrane preparations (26, 27). Comparative concentration-response curves with glucagon, ACTH, and epinephrine showed that combinations of maximal doses of hormones failed to produce additive stimulation. It was postulated that, in the membrane of the fat cell, a single catalytic unit of adenylyl cyclase was coupled to distinct selective sites for the three lipolytic hormones (17, 27). This important finding revealed that the enzyme was not the initial site of action of the hormones but that hormones operated by some indirect action, a view that initiated intensive research into the adenylyl cyclase complex. On the basis of several results obtained on fat cell membrane preparations and as soon as 1970, Rodbell elaborated on a concept that it was essential to distinguish in the hormonal action the existence of highly selective “discriminators” (e.g., the future receptors) that were selecting the hormone available to act on adipose tissue and a coupling element involved in the transmission of the information between the discriminator and adenylyl cyclase. Rodbell also postulated the existence of a “transducer” (e.g., the future GTP-binding proteins) allowing the coupling. It was proposed that, in the case of the fat cell, the transducer(s) contributed to the coupling between at least six identified discriminators and adenylyl cyclase. This very productive concept was expanded to adenylyl cyclase in a number of other cell systems (25). A number of biochemical characteristics of adenylyl cyclase and its coupled receptors were characterized in fat cell membranes during the following years (e.g., role of Mg²⁺, guanine nucleotides, F⁻, secretin, glucagon, ACTH, insulin, PGs, adenosine, nicotinic acid, and cholera and pertussis toxins). Adenylyl cyclase assays were improved and optimized (291). Adenylyl cyclase activity was inhibited by PGs, adenosine, and nicotinic acid, whereas insulin had no direct effect on the enzyme. Nucleotides were postulated to react with the transducer, resulting in changes in the binding of hormones to discriminators and in the activation of adenylyl cyclase by the hormones. The biphasic inhibitory and stimulatory effects of the nucleotides and the role of hormones were studied using fat cell membranes and supported the idea that GTP-binding proteins were important regulators of adenylyl cyclase (57, 229, 288, 305). The resolution of a general concept was improving rapidly (292, 399). In an important review in

1980, Rodbell summarized the actual view integrating the role of hormone receptors and GTP-regulatory proteins in membrane transduction (289). Thereafter, except for some studies by Murayama and Ui (250), who discovered the importance the ADP-ribosylating *Bordetella pertussis* toxin (i.e., islet-activating protein), the fat cell was less used. In all the subsequent studies leading to the biochemical identification, isolation, and purification of G proteins, the catalytic unit of adenylyl cyclase, and various receptors, a number of other cell systems, easier to manage, such as hepatocytes, platelets, neutrophils, peritoneal fat cells, avian erythrocytes, frog erythrocytes, and various cell lines (i.e., C6 cells and mouse 3T3 fibroblasts), have been preferred over fat cells. It became clear to all the investigators that the concepts proposed in the late 1970s were correct. The adenylyl cyclase system is responsible for the transduction of receptor occupancy by hormones into a modulated rate of cAMP synthesis. An adenylyl cyclase complex responds to stimulatory and inhibitory hormonal regulation. In addition to hormone receptors and the cAMP-synthesizing catalytic unit, upon activation by receptor stimulation, coupling proteins regulate the activity of the catalytic unit. Stimulation of cAMP synthesis results from activation of a stimulatory coupling protein (initially Nₛ and now Gₛ) by a stimulatory receptor, whereas inhibition results from activation of a separate, but structurally related, inhibitory coupling protein (initially Nᵢ and now Gᵢ) by inhibitory receptors. Activation of Gₛ or Gᵢ requires GTP and Mg²⁺, and these proteins are active GTPases (56, 157, 329).

Mature adipocyte and fat cell membrane preparations were extensively used by the experts in adipose tissue metabolism to study the impact of adrenalectomy, glucocorticoids, thyroidectomy, and thyroid hormones on lipolysis, cAMP levels, and adenylyl cyclase activity. All the emerging tools (particularly antibodies and toxins, such as cholera toxin and *B. pertussis* toxin) for the exploration of the adenylyl cyclase complex elements have been used by various investigators to delineate functional changes in membrane properties with growth, diet, and fat cell hypertrophy, as well as metabolic and endocrine diseases. Not all these aspects that enhanced our knowledge of signaling pathways can be considered in detail in this review.

C342 HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVES IN FAT CELL BIOLOGY

**Use of the Isolated Fat Cell for Discovery of the Primary Action of Hormones at the Plasma Membrane Level**

The fat cell has noticeably contributed to the discovery of the mechanism of action of hormones controlling metabolic processes. Ideas generated in the late 1930s, which were expanded by Alquist in the 1940s by the concept of adrenergic receptors, finally came to fruition in the late 1960s. The proposition that a large number of metabolic effects initiated by numerous hormones on target cells resulted from interaction of the hormone with the plasma membranes was elegantly validated for insulin by Cuatrecasas (61–65) in fat cells and expanded to a number of other receptors controlling adenyl cyclase activity and other metabolic pathways.

*Insulin action on the isolated fat cells: discovery of the insulin receptor.* Several investigators used the fat cell system to establish that insulin exerted potent stimulating effects on glucose uptake and lipogenesis and inhibited the lipolytic effect of various hormones (16, 98, 183, 286). Investigators were impressed by the multiplicity of insulin action on adipose tissue (e.g., drop in intracellular cAMP, increase in cAMP phosphodiesterase activity, initiation of phosphorylation of various proteins in intact cells, and stimulation of glucose uptake and metabolism). Alterations in the distribution of ions across the cell surface, particularly Ca²⁺, and inhibition of the membrane's ion pumps were also shown to affect insulin action. Insulin action required fat cell integrity and was not dependent on adenyl cyclase. Insulin mimetic effects were also discovered with concanavalin A and wheat germ agglutinin, which were as effective as insulin in increasing glucose transport and inhibiting epinephrine-stimulated lipolysis in isolated adipocytes. In addition, the insulin-like actions of phospholipases (285), proteases (201, 202), and sulfhydryl reagents (217) suggested that alterations of structural elements in the plasma membrane could contribute to the effects of insulin. The insulin effector system of fat cells was destroyed by proteases such as trypsin, chymotrypsin, and papain, while the effect of epinephrine was preserved (197). Fat cells were able to recover, and protein synthesis was suspected to be involved in the recovery (196). All these studies based on the measurement of complex metabolic parameters focused on the distal consequences of insulin interaction with membrane structures. Although various parameters of insulin action were established, it was not known whether insulin exerted its metabolic action solely by interaction with membrane surface structures or by entry of the hormone (or a part of the molecule) into the fat cell.

The convincing demonstration of the primary action of insulin on the fat cell membrane was provided by the elegant studies of Cuatrecasas (62), who used large polymers of insulin-Sepharose complexes, which were unable to penetrate the isolated fat cell. Such derivatives remained biologically active and increased glucose utilization and suppressed the hormone-stimulated lipolysis of isolated rat fat cells (62). Anti-insulin serum blocked the insulin-Sepharose effect. Insulin-Sepharose was as effective as native unbound insulin (98), and insulin was not released from the polymeric complex during incubation. This study supported the unitary view that the metabolic effects promoted by insulin were based on the propagation of an effect that resulted exclusively from specific interactions of the hormone with the plasma membrane of the cell. The concept of the insulin receptor was established. The availability of radioactive insulin and improvements in the methods to define the kinetics of association to its receptors were important steps in the understanding of insulin action. A method to measure specific binding of biologically active monoiodoinsulin ([¹²⁵I]insulin) to intact fat cells and membrane fractions was developed, and parameters of binding were defined (61, 64, 115). The receptor site binds insulin with a high degree of specificity and affinity; the specific binding sites are finite in number, and hormone binding is rapid and reversible. Hormone binding was related to biological effects. Perturbation of insulin binding to the membrane receptor by treatment with proteolytic enzymes and neuraminidase confirmed the previous metabolic studies in isolated fat cells (65). Low concentrations of wheat germ agglutinin enhanced the specific binding of insulin to receptors of fat cells, while higher concentrations of this plant lectin, as well as concanavalin A, competitively displaced the binding of insulin to the receptor.

The insulin receptor concept generated many investigations of major tissues known to respond to insulin. It was established that the binding affinity of insulin or an insulin analog was directly proportional to the biological potency. Delineation of the parameters of insulin-insulin receptor interactions was optimized in a number of studies using various cells and cell membrane preparations, including fat cells. It quickly became obvious that, in addition to hormone binding to the receptor, quantitative analysis required consideration of the degradation of the hormone and the receptor. Insulin binding at steady state enabled determination of the apparent insulin-binding capacity and the apparent dissociation constant of the insulin-insulin receptor complex. Scatchard analyses of these data revealed heterogeneity of the binding sites with respect to the equilibrium constant (63). Models for binding studies were improved, and the existence of site-site interactions with negative cooperativity was described for insulin receptors (75). Studies of insulin-insulin receptor interactions have led to a variety of applications. Insulin-insulin receptor binding systems were used to study hormone structure-activity relationships and to analyze endogenous forms of insulin and insulin mimetics. Another important application of the insulin-insulin receptor binding approach is study of receptor alterations in pathological states. An insulin-insulin receptor defect has been shown in adipocytes, liver, thymic lymphocytes, and myocardium of the obese hyperglycemic (*ob/ob*) mouse (114). The defect essentially involves a decrease in the number of binding sites and selectively affects the insulin receptor. The number of insulin receptors per cell fluctuates in response to altered in vivo conditions (e.g., fasting, hypophysectomy, obesity, and glucocorticoid excess); the loss of receptors was similar in fat, liver, and lymphocytes. A variety of data, in vivo and in vitro, indicated an inverse relationship between the concentration of insulin and the number of insulin receptors and suggested a negative feedback of the hormone on its own receptor. Chronic (but not acute) hyperinsulinemia was associated with a substantial reduction in the concentration of insulin receptors per cell (123, 125, 133). Subsequently, with the development of techniques such as affinity labeling, chromatography, and immunoprecipitation, it was possible to purify the receptor and determine its subunit structures and amino acid sequences, as summarized in several reviews (73, 175, 219). All further biochemical studies concerning insulin receptor isolation and

transduction of the insulin signal have not used the fat cell as
a privileged tool, as described above for the discovery of the
receptor (i.e., hepatoma cells, lymphocytes, and hepatocytes
were preferred). Soon, it was clearly shown that the receptor
was a transmembrane glycoprotein with two α- and two β-sub-
units linked by disulfide bonds. It was demonstrated that
insulin binds to the extracellular portion of the α-subunit and
activates the tyrosine protein kinase activity of the β-chain
(189). Insulin-insulin receptor properties and the discovery of
insulin signaling pathways, mainly in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, are
not detailed here and have been considered in a number of
excellent reviews that include all the cell systems commonly
used (53, 350, 358, 384).

Adrenergic receptors. The very early in vivo studies and
utilization of isolated fat cells revealed that catecholamines
were major physiological regulators of fat cell function. Epi-
nephrine and norepinephrine exerted potent lipolytic effects in
fat cells of various species. Conventional pharmacological
analysis, based on the relative potencies of selected adrenergic
agonists and antagonists on various biological responses of fat
cells (i.e., lipolytic effects, variations in cAMP content, phos-
phatidylinositol turnover, or plasma membrane adenyl cyclase
activity), led to the functional identification of fat cell
adrenergic receptor subtypes around the 1980s. Initially, Fain
proposed that the adrenergic receptors in rat adipocytes were of
the β₁-subtype and coupled to adenyl cyclase (92), while a
mixed β- and α-subtype sensitivity was suspected in human fat
cells (39, 261). On the basis of pharmacological consider-
ations, the existence of two distinct populations of β (i.e., β₁
and β₂)- and α (i.e., α₁ and α₂)-adrenergic receptors was
proposed by pharmacologists. Since their discovery, α₂-adren-
ergic receptors were considered to be exclusively located in
sympathetic presynaptic nerve terminals and involved in the
control of norepinephrine release, until they were also found in
human fat cells (40, 207). Activation of α₂-adrenergic recep-
tors inhibited lipolysis (207) and adenyl cyclase in human fat
cells (190). Effects of α₂-adrenergic receptors in rodent adi-
pocytes were weak compared with those in human adipocytes.
Stimulation of α₁-adrenergic receptors in rodent fat cells in-
creased cytosol Ca²⁺ and stimulated phosphatidylinositol turn-
over and glycogen phosphorylase via mechanisms independent
of cAMP production (96). On the basis of the usual pharma-
cological tools used at that time, the β-adrenergic responsive-
ness of rat fat cells was quite puzzling and suggested the
presence of atypical β-adrenergic receptors (149, 150). The
discovery of new pharmacological tools with limited impact on
classic β₁/₂-adrenergic receptors was very useful to clarify this
pharmacological debate (13, 34). This question was resolved
later with the discovery that, in addition to β₁- and β₂-
adrenergic receptors, β₃-adrenergic receptors were playing a
major role in the control of lipolysis in rodent (212) and dog (120)
fat cells. Coexpression of three β-adrenergic receptor subtypes
by fat cells suggested that they may serve different signaling
functions (137). Binding studies with high-affinity β-adrener-
gic antagonists (i.e., [³H]dihydroalprenolol and [³H]CGP-
12177) and α₂-adrenergic antagonists (i.e., [³H]yohimbine and
[³H]RX-821002) were soon developed to optimize the identi-
fication of adrenergic receptors in human fat cell membranes
and to determine binding parameters, coupling efficiency with
the G proteins, and modifications of expression in physiolog-
ical and pathological situations (208). After the period of

intensive utilization of binding studies, attempts were made to
purify and structurally characterize rat fat cell β-adrenergic
receptors (66, 249), but the fat cell was not extensively used for
further studies. Receptor solubilization and purification proce-
dures, adrenergic receptor gene identification, and determina-
tion of the structural characteristics of the various β- and
α-adrenergic receptor subtypes, with the exception of the
β₃-adrenergic receptor (90), by Caron and Lefkowitz (48)
considerably enhanced the power of research tools to explore
fat cell functions. Basic concepts of the role and variability of
adrenergic receptors were established in rodent and human fat
cells; species-specific differences in fat cell adrenergic recep-
tors were also identified. Most of the studies developed on the
adrenergic regulation of adipocyte metabolism and the role of
adrenergic receptors in humans and various species have been
extensively discussed in several reviews (93, 97, 208–210,
282). Briefly, the major conclusions drawn from a number of
investigations on fat cells of various species are as follows. The
three β-adrenergic receptor subtypes (i.e., β₁, β₂, and β₃) are
members of the large family of G protein-coupled receptors,
each of which is coupled to Gαₛ and increases intracellular
cAMP levels and activates PKA. By contrast, the α₂-adrener-
gic receptor is coupled to Gαᵢ, and its stimulation decreases
cAMP and PKA activity. Activation of the β-adrenergic re-
ceptors leads to the mobilization of stored fatty acids and
regulates the release of several adipokines, while selective
activation of α₂-adrenergic receptors does the opposite. The fat
cell bears five different adrenergic receptors on its plasma
membrane and was used to define the rules leading to the
differential activation/recruitment of such receptors by physi-
ological amines. The α₂- and β-adrenergic receptors are re-
cruited differentially by catecholamines on the basis of their
relative affinity for the amines. Epinephrine has a higher
affinity for α₂- than β-adrenergic receptors; the functional
consequences have been clearly delineated in human fat cells.
β-Adrenergic receptors also differ in their relative affinity for
catecholamines and in their susceptibility to desensitization;
the relationship to structural discrepancies has also been de-
scribed (203). The level of expression of β- and α₂-adrenergic
receptor subtypes shows major differences between species
and in their distribution in human fat cells according to the
anatomic location of fat deposits. β₃-Adrenergic receptors are
highly expressed on rodent adipocytes (209). Genetic engineer-
ing has been used in mice to test the hypothesis that the balance
of α₂- to β-adrenergic receptors in adipocytes is an important
determinant of total body fat stores. Mice that have a “human-
like” pattern of adrenergic receptor expression in adipocytes
(more α₂- than β₁- and β₂-adrenergic receptors and no β₃-
adrenergic receptors) have been successfully created. Increased
balance of α₂- to β-adrenergic receptors promotes high-fat
diet-induced obesity in mice. The development of obesity
required the presence of α₂- and the absence of β₃-adrenergic
receptors on adipocytes and a high-fat diet. The results suggest
an important interaction between two genes and diet in the
regulation of total body fat stores (369).

The importance of β₃-adrenergic receptors in rodent fat cells
is not questioned, while β-adrenergic responsiveness of human
adipocytes has been strenuously debated. It is clear that lipol-
ysis is mainly regulated by β₂- and β₁-adrenergic receptors in
human adipocytes. The physiological role of the β₃-adrenergic
receptor in human adipose tissue was debated during the

C344 HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVES IN FAT CELL BIOLOGY

1990s. Although a pathogenic role was proposed in 1995 (231), the receptor does not contribute to catecholamine-induced lipolysis in human subcutaneous adipocytes (352). One of the agonists commonly used to validate β₃-adrenergic effects, CGP-12177, exerts atypical interactions with β₁-adrenergic receptors (136, 195). Confirmation of the lack of β₃-adrenergic effects in humans has also been provided by in vivo studies. During isoproterenol infusion, there was no evidence of a β₃-adrenergic receptor-mediated increase in lipid mobilization, energy expenditure, and lipid oxidation in humans (307); administration of another β₃-adrenergic compound also provided negative results (271). Similar negative conclusions were also reached using in situ microdialysis (18). In conclusion, although low expression of β₃-adrenergic receptor mRNA levels and some β₃-agonists exerted weak lipolytic activity in vitro, a role for β₃-adrenergic receptors in the regulation of lipid mobilization has not been convincingly validated in vivo in humans. A number of controversial results have been published concerning a polymorphism in codon 64 (Trp⁶⁴Arg) of the β₃-adrenergic receptor gene and the development of obesity and obesity-related disorders; this question was discussed in a meta-analysis (10). On the basis of existing data, the Trp⁶⁴Arg polymorphism does not appear to be significantly associated with body mass index. Moreover, there was no evidence for effect heterogeneity, suggesting that the effect of the polymorphism is not moderated by ethnicity or diabetic status (10).

Antilipolytic receptors. Insulin is the major antilipolytic hormone, exerting its antilipolytic effect subsequent to insulin receptor activation via activation of phosphodiesterase 3B, which hydrolyzes cAMP into inactive 5′-AMP and, thereby, diminishes PKA-mediated phosphorylations and lipolysis. The fat cell remains a good tool to explore the emerging mechanism of insulin action. For example, lactate has recently been shown to contribute to the insulin-dependent inhibition of lipolysis in rodent fat cells via activation of a Gᵢ-coupled receptor identified as GPR81(8).

Besides insulin, a large number of compounds, including adenosine, PGs, and adipocyte metabolites, had been shown to exert potent antilipolytic effects and inhibit cAMP production and adenyl cyclase activity in the early studies on fat cells (102, 229, 362). After a number of additional studies, it became evident that all these antilipolytic effects were mediated by antilipolytic receptors negatively coupled to adenyl cyclase through Gᵢ proteins and inhibition of cAMP production. Most of these mediators were thought to act in a paracrine manner. Classical binding techniques utilizing receptor agonists or antagonists were used in attempts to identify the receptors. Binding studies with agonists such as [³H]adenosine (235) and the agonist resistant to degradation by adenosine deaminase, (−)-N⁶-[³H]phenylisopropyladenosine, were used to identify adenosine receptors in rat fat cell membranes (361). Because of the relatively stable binding of (−)-N⁶-[³H]phenylisopropyladenosine, it could be useful as a ligand. Human adenosine A₁ receptor binding sites were also identified using the antagonist [³H]1,3-dipropyl-8-cyclopentylxanthine (213). [³H]PGE₂ has been used to identify specific PGE₂ binding sites in human fat cells. A tight coupling was observed between the receptor binding of PGE₂ and its antilipolytic effect (279, 280). In the 1990s, NPY and peptide YY (PYY) were shown to exert antilipolytic effects in human fat cells, although their physiological role remains elusive. Binding assays were used to characterize the human fat cell NPY/PYY receptor as an NPY-Y₁ receptor subtype, which, when stimulated, inhibits, via Gᵢ protein coupling, adenyl cyclase, cAMP production, and lipolysis (368). In addition, NPY/PYY receptor stimulation had a positive action on leptin secretion by human fat cells (319).

### Isolated Fat Cell and Discovery of Hexose and Fatty Acid Transport Systems

Adipose tissue and striated skeletal muscles are major sites of glucose and fatty acid uptake. It is now accepted by the scientific community that glucose and free fatty acids are cleared from the bloodstream by a diversity of mechanisms that have been particularly elucidated in fat cells. Glucose is transferred by a family of glucose transporters (GLUTs) that transport glucose down its concentration gradient into the cells of target tissues. After their release by lipoprotein lipase activity on circulating triglycerides at the capillary level, fatty acids are taken up by target cells via complex sequential processes that control their uptake and have been particularly investigated in isolated fat cells, 3T3-F442A, ob17, and 3T3-L1 adipocytes.

**Fat cells, glucose uptake, and glucose transporters.** The regulation of glucose uptake into fat cells and muscle cells is a fundamental action of insulin, and this process is impaired in type 2 diabetes. One of the fascinating discoveries in the past two decades concerns the mechanisms whereby insulin regulates glucose uptake by target cells. The isolated fat cell has been an important system for the early studies of the mechanisms involved in the transport of glucose. The very early studies showed that D-glucose was transported through the membranes of the fat cell by carrier-facilitated diffusion and that a major action of insulin was to enhance this process (59). Since the rapid conversion of labeled glucose to its final metabolites cannot be taken as a strict measure of glucose transfer, methods using nonmetabolizable sugars were developed. Transport rates were established using L-arabinose, 2-deoxyglucose, and 3-O-methyl glucose and an original oil flotation technique allowing short-term (i.e., within seconds) measurements (71, 111). A number of studies using isolated rat adipocytes focused on the relationships between insulin binding, glucose transport, and glucose oxidation, taking into account several physiological states of the animals (e.g., fasting, spontaneous obesity, insulin resistance, diabetes, and aging) (129, 130, 257, 258, 375). When cAMP levels were lowered with antilipolytic agents (insulin, nicotinic acid, or clofibrate), rates of glucose transport were increased. In contrast, when adipose tissue levels of cAMP were raised by lipolytic hormones or theophylline, glucose transport was increased by lipolytic agents (354). Stimulation of β-adrenergic receptors attenuates insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in rat fat cells (181). Thereafter, it was suspected that glucose could be transferred by transporters and that the number of functioning membrane-associated transporters must increase in the presence of insulin.

Cytochalasin, a fungal metabolite known to inhibit glucose transport in a variety of cell types, became an interesting tool for the identification of fat cell glucose transporters. With fat cell membranes prepared by a modification of the differential ultracentrifugation method of McKeel and Jarett (243), [³H]cy-

tochalasin B binding and its competitive inhibition by D-glucose were used to evaluate the number of putative glucose transport systems in plasma membranes prepared from isolated rat epididymal cells (70, 382). Insulin was shown to increase the number of glucose transporter systems (i.e., \[^3\text{H}\]cytochalasin binding sites) in the plasma membrane of the isolated rat fat cell through a rapid and reversible translocation of glucose transport systems from a specific intracellular membrane pool (188). An identical phenomenon had been observed by Suzuki and Kono (345) using an original reconstitution technique for preparing liposomes from subcellular membrane fractions of isolated rat fat cells. Moreover, they noted that the intracellular storage site was specifically associated with a low-density membrane fraction characteristic of membranes of the Golgi apparatus. \[^3\text{H}\]cytochalasin binding was used to investigate the impact of the adipose cell enlargement, accompanied by the development of a marked “insulin resistance” at the glucose transport level. A relative depletion of glucose transport systems in the intracellular pool was reported with insulin resistance in rodents (162, 163).

These original approaches leading to the “translocation hypothesis” were postulated long before the biochemical identification and the cloning of the glucose transporter protein GLUT4. More than 2,500 scientific papers deal with the regulation of this transporter. The cDNA encoding GLUT4 was cloned by five separate groups in 1989 (24, 51, 117, 176, 185), and a new area of research was opened. Isoform-specific antibodies were prepared and used to confirm that, in response to insulin, the results previously reported in 1980 corresponded to the translocation of GLUT4 to the cell surface. An impermeant photoaffinity label, 2-N-4(1-azi-2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)benzoyl-1,3-bis(D-mannos-4-yloxy)-2-propylamine, has been used to identify cell surface glucose transporters in isolated rat adipose cells. This reagent, in combination with immunoprecipitation by specific antibodies against GLUT4 and GLUT1, was used to estimate the relative abundance of these two transporters on the surface of the intact adipose cell following stimulation by insulin (168). GLUT4 proteins translocate from intracellular vesicular pools to the plasma membrane via an exocytosis process, and they return to the intracellular compartment via endocytosis. GLUT4 is found in a complex tubulovesicular network connected to the endosomal-trans-Golgi network and is practically absent from the plasma membrane in the absence of stimulation. Given the importance of insulin-GLUT4 translocation in human physiology and human diseases, the signaling events leading to GLUT4 translocation became a major area of interest for various groups. Much of the present knowledge and new developments on GLUT4 traffic came from the studies in preadipocyte and muscle cell lines.

After all the initial studies on mature adipocytes, which were of major interest in exploration of the function/dysfunction of insulin responsiveness in physiological and pathological conditions, some limitations appeared. These limitations were due to the inherent fragility of mature adipocytes and the abundance of lipids trapping some intracellular proteins during the isolation procedures and the limited interest in sophisticated immunohistochemical approaches. Utilization of mature adipocytes remained limited to the exploration of questions related to physiological/pathological situations using the new tools proposed by cell and molecular biology. The 3T3-L1

adipocytes have been extensively used as the gold standard to investigate activity of the glucose transmembrane transporters GLUT1 and GLUT4 and all the plasma membrane and intracellular events following insulin stimulation of glucose transport. They allow dynamic assays of vesicle movements within cells under a very large range of conditions. A number of elegant imaging technologies implemented by many groups have been developed using 3T3-L1 adipocytes, rather than mature adipocytes. Nevertheless, some differences between 3T3-L1 cells and mature adipocytes have been reported. Briefly, in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, insulin-stimulated glucose uptake is ~10-fold above basal levels (compared with the 20-fold increase in mature rodent adipocytes and the 2-to 3-fold increase in human fat cells). The other glucose transporter GLUT1, which mainly contributes to basal glucose uptake, could also participate, along with GLUT4, in insulin-induced glucose uptake. It is expressed at higher levels in 3T3-L1 adipocytes than in mature rodent or human adipocytes. Whatever limitations are inherent to such discrepancies with mature adipocytes, numerous studies have been performed to delineate the relative contribution of both transport systems to glucose uptake activity by 3T3-L1 cells. Moreover, differential regulation of expression of both glucose transporters by a variety of factors and pharmacological compounds was also explored. For instance, cAMP inversely regulates GLUT4 and GLUT1 expression (186). GLUT4 has been extensively studied in the 3T3-L1 adipocytes. GLUT4 is located mainly in the perinuclear area and, to a lesser extent, in cytosolic vesicles, which are abundant in the mature adipocyte (174). 3T3-L1 adipocytes are of major interest because of the limited amount of triglycerides, the ease of immunofluorescence staining, and all the possibilities for transfection. Total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy was used to reveal highly mobile structures containing enhanced green fluorescent protein-tagged GLUT4 within a zone ~100 nm beneath the plasma membrane of 3T3-L1 adipocytes (173). The molecular mechanism by which insulin stimulates GLUT4 translocation in adipose cells, including the nature of the signaling pathways involved and the role of the cytoskeleton, has been the subject of intensive research. The signals regulating membrane trafficking of the insulin-responsive GLUT4 in adipocytes have been summarized in some excellent reviews (38, 172, 322, 358, 384, 385). A number of partners interacting with GLUT4 and regulating its half-life and its tethering to endomembranes have been identified (174, 403). It is clear that the signaling processes downstream from the insulin receptor have been clarified concerning the signaling cascades. The most intensively studied, with respect to insulin-induced GLUT4 translocation, involves phosphoinositide 3-kinase and several downstream effectors including Akt/PKB, the 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1, the atypical PKC isoforms λ and ζ (aPKCλ and aPKCζ), and one substrate of Akt/PKB, AS160 (its precise role remains to be elucidated). Stimulation of β-adrenergic receptors by isoproterenol is known to inhibit glucose transport and insulin-induced GLUT4 translocation (181). β-Adrenergic receptor stimulation promoted phosphorylation of the COOH terminus of GLUT4 at serine 488 in vivo, and cAMP-dependent PKA phosphorylated the same site in vitro (218).

New recent technical developments have facilitated the clarification of the trafficking steps regulated by insulin at the

plasma membrane level. The final stage of the translocation process could be investigated using an in vitro assay that allows the fusion of GLUT4 vesicles with the plasma membrane to be studied using total internal reflection microscopy (385); a similar assay was performed for mature rat adipocytes (228). Although extensively studied by several groups, the GLUT4 compartments, the regulated steps in GLUT4 exocytosis, the structural determinants of GLUT4 protein playing a role in the insulin responsiveness of the transporter, and insulin signals regulating GLUT4 remain subjects of research, and the 3T3-L1 adipocytes contribute noticeably to the progression of our knowledge. Nevertheless, sophisticated translocation/docking mechanisms reported in 3T3-L1 adipocytes could show some differences by comparison with mature adipocytes. The large and unique lipid droplet-containing vacuoles of mature adipocytes have a morphology distinct from that of 3T3-L1 adipocytes, in which multiple small lipid droplets are scattered throughout the cytoplasm. This large lipid droplet of the mature adipocyte certainly influences the distribution of the other cell components (i.e., ER, mitochondria, and nucleus) and displaces the nucleus and cytoplasm elements at the periphery very near the plasma membrane. Thus, organelles and all the GLUT4-containing compartments are essentially packed into 1–2 μm between the lipid droplet and the plasma membrane. All kinetic events reported in 3T3-L1 cells could be different in mature adipocytes and a fortiori in in vivo situations, where essentially mature adipocytes are involved.

The last point concerns the species-related differences. Although it is less efficient than in rodents, the glucose transport system also operates in human adipocytes (240). Insulin-induced transport stimulation in isolated fat cells is weak (2- to 3-fold increase in glucose uptake) compared with that in rodent fat cells. It would be wise to verify if all the mechanisms and concepts originating from studies on 3T3-L1 adipocytes remain relevant in human fat cells. The identification of molecules interfering with the GLUT4 storage compartment and/or regulating translocation of GLUT4 in response to insulin could represent new targets to design new therapeutic compounds for prevention or treatment of type 2 diabetes. The 3T3-L1 and 3T3-F442A adipocytes still offer useful opportunities for overexpression or downregulation of various partners involved in GLUT4 translocation and hormone-mediated regulations. In addition, over the past few years, several gene knockout and transgenic technologies have provided important new insights into mature adipocyte biology in mice (371).

Fat cells, fatty acid uptake and transfer, and fatty acid transporters. Long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs) are taken up by cells and used for a diversity of biological functions. Moreover, they represent an important component of nutrients and play a role in many chronic diseases. The first regulatory step in nutrient homeostasis is cellular uptake, and to enter cells, fatty acids are obliged to cross the plasma membrane. LCFAs can diffuse rapidly across protein-free phospholipid bilayers (146). Considering that fatty acids are lipophilic molecules, it was postulated that their transfer across the plasma membrane could be a completely passive diffusional event. Two factors were supposed to be able to govern the process: the molar ratio of fatty acids bound to albumin in the circulation to the fatty acid needs (utilization) of the target cells. Nevertheless, despite such a view, it was not easy to reconcile the passive transfer hypothesis with the multiple functions and the numerous regulatory roles described for LCFAs. In the past three decades, evidence has accumulated to show that transport proteins facilitated fatty acid transfer and that their movements were under acute and chronic control.

The fat cell contributed noticeably to the early studies to decipher the mechanisms of fatty acid translocation across the cell membranes, while preadipose cell lines (3T3-F442A, ob17, and 3T3-L1) were used to investigate functional responses and a number of regulatory events. The first studies of fatty acid transport kinetics were carried out with isolated rat adipocytes: the mechanism of permeation of LCFAs was investigated using \[^{14}C\]oleate. Uptake appeared to be independent of fatty acid metabolism, and membrane fatty acid permeation showed nonlinear saturation kinetics as the function of unbound fatty acids. Oleate permeates the plasma membrane of the rat adipocyte principally by a transport process with the characteristics of facilitated diffusion. It was concluded that the permeation of LCFAs was by a saturable mechanism that was suspected to be protein-mediated. At physiological levels of unbound fatty acid, it was considered that permeation was almost entirely operating through this mechanism. However, at higher concentrations of unbound fatty acid, permeation via a mechanism with diffusion kinetics was also detectable, indicating some limited passage of fatty acids directly through the phospholipid bilayer (6). Saturability of fatty acid permeation was demonstrated in many cell types other than adipocytes (i.e., hepatocytes, cardiac myocytes, intestinal cells, and myocytes). The specificity of the fatty acid transport system was described in studies using a variety of natural fatty acids of different chain length, or fatty acid analogs. Competition between different fatty acids for uptake was another way to demonstrate the saturability of the process. Oleate, stearate, linoleate, palmitate, and laurate were good substrates, while octanoate was not transported. Transported fatty acids must have a hydrocarbon chain of at least nine carbons and a free COOH function to be recognized by the transporter. All these results proved that permeation of the plasma membrane of the adipocyte by LCFAs at physiological concentrations is mediated by a protein transporter with distinct specificity requirements. Biochemical arguments based on the use of various protein-modifying agents also supported the existence of carrier-mediated membrane permeation of fatty acids (5).

With regard to hormonal regulation of the process, in 1971, it was revealed that the efflux of preformed fatty acids from adipocytes was accelerated by cAMP and may require an energy supply (308). Epinephrine was shown to rapidly stimulate the transport of LCFAs across the plasma membrane. The stimulated rates were 5- to 10-fold higher than the basal rate of influx or efflux. The stimulatory effect on transport was mediated by β-adrenergic receptor interaction and cAMP. The hormone effect was on the transport process specifically, as shown by isolation of the product of transport in either direction as unesterified fatty acids and inhibition by the transport inhibitors phloretin and DIDS. This effect of epinephrine on fatty acid transport was physiologically well correlated with lipase activation and lipolysis (4). Insulin at physiological concentrations completely blocked or reversed the epinephrine effect. The insulin effect was shown to be on the transport process, since insulin inhibited epinephrine activation of transport in both directions (influx and efflux). No effect of insulin on basal transport was observed over a wide range of concentrations.

trations (0.01–10 nM). Insulin's antagonism of transport activation by epinephrine appeared dependent on ATP metabolism. These data indicate that, in addition to the counteraction of lipolysis stimulation, regulation of the membrane transport of fatty acids was also potentially involved in insulin's action to suppress lipid mobilization (7).

Covalent labeling with sulfo-N-succinimidyl esters of LCFAs was a useful strategy to identify the protein. Sulfo-N-succinimidyl esters of LCFAs, which specifically inhibited the transport of oleate by rat adipocytes, were used to characterize the putative fatty acid transporter. These compounds bound to an 85- to 90-kDa membrane protein that was also labeled by another inhibitor of fatty acid transport, \[^3\)H]DIDS. This protein was a strong candidate as the transporter for LCFA; its apparent molecular mass was 88 kDa. \[^3\)H]-labeled sulfo-N-succinimidyl oleate, which specifically labeled the 88-kDa protein, was used to isolate the protein from the rat adipocyte plasma membrane. Identification of 15 amino acids at the NH₂-terminal region revealed strong sequence homology with two previously described membrane glycoproteins: CD36, a ubiquitous protein originally identified in platelets, and PAS IV, a protein that is enriched in the apical membranes of lipid-secreting mammary cells during lactation. Antibodies against PAS IV cross-reacted with the adipocyte protein. This, together with the NH₂-terminal sequence homology, suggested that the adipocyte protein identified as FAT/CD36 belongs to a family of related intrinsic membrane proteins that include CD36 and PAS IV (148).

A cDNA for the adipocyte membrane protein FAT/CD36, implicated in the transport of LCFAs, was isolated by screening with a synthetic oligonucleotide derived from the NH₂-terminal sequence of the protein (3). Extensive glycosylation of the protein most likely explains why the molecular mass of the isolated protein (88 kDa) is different from that deduced from the cDNA sequence (53 kDa). The sequence of FAT is 85% homologous with that of the glycoprotein IV (CD36) identified in human platelets and in lactating mammary epithelium. A polyclonal antibody against CD36 reacted with adipocyte plasma membranes and detected a single band at 88 kDa. FAT/CD36 is a prominent marker of preadipocyte differentiation into adipocytes. FAT/CD36 mRNAs were undetectable in cultured adipose cell lines (Ob1771 and 3T3-F442A) when they were at the fibroblastic stage but were strongly induced during the differentiation process and by treatment of preadipocytes with dexamethasone. They were also associated with an increase in oleate transport. In contrast, the fibroblastic cell line 3T3-C2, which does not differentiate, did not express the mRNAs at any stage of culture. The data suggest that FAT and CD36 belong to a family of proteins that bind/transport LCFAs or function as regulators of these processes.

In addition to FAT/CD36, other proteins have been shown to be involved in fatty acid transport. Another fatty acid transport protein was discovered using the 3T3-L1 adipocytes. With use of an expression cloning strategy and a cDNA library from 3T3-L1 adipocytes, a cDNA that augmented LCFA uptake, when expressed in cultured cells, was identified. Mouse-transfected cells exhibited an increase in the uptake of LCFAs (palmitic, myristic, and arachidonic acids) and a weaker uptake of short-chain fatty acids. This cDNA encodes a novel 646-amino acid fatty acid transport protein (FATP, later renamed FATP1) that has six predicted membrane-spanning regions and

is integrally associated with membranes. Immunocytochemistry and subcellular fractionation of 3T3-L1 adipocytes showed that FATP was localized to the plasma membrane. FATP was proposed to be another plasma membrane transporter for LCFAs (306). Expression of FATP1 and FATP4 is induced during 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation. Insulin induces plasma membrane translocation of FATPs from an intracellular perinuclear compartment to the plasma membrane in adipocytes, with translocation being observed within minutes of insulin treatment and paralleled by an increase in LCFA uptake. In contrast, TNF-α treatment inhibited basal and insulin-induced LCFA uptake and reduced FATP1 and FATP4 levels (335).

A specific 40-kDa plasma membrane fatty acid-binding protein (FABPpm), previously isolated from the gut, was also shown to operate in isolated rat adipocytes. The protein FABPpm was later shown to be the membrane-bound form of aspartate amino transferase. A transport process similar to that in other tissues with high transmembrane fatty acid fluxes was described in rat adipocytes and when expression of FABPpm was induced in 3T3 cells. \[^3\)H]oleate uptake into isolated rat adipocytes was significantly inhibited by phloretin and by prior incubation of the cells with pronase. These data indicate that the uptake of oleate by rat adipocytes is also mediated by a 40-kDa FABPpm closely related to that described in liver and gut. The protein is induced during differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells in parallel with an increase in fatty acid uptake (316, 407).

After the above-mentioned reports on the contribution of the fat cell to the discovery of membrane transport of LCFA and early reports concerning the mechanism of action, ongoing studies by several groups of investigators provided more definitive information. Emerging novel concepts regarding the regulation FATP1/FATP4- or CD36-facilitated uptake have been developed. Uptake might require membrane lipid rafts, with initial fatty acid metabolism probably occurring in segregated raft domains or caveolae. The role of membrane rafts and caveolae, the recycling processes assuming the shuttle of proteins between the intracellular compartment and the membrane, and the biochemical modifications of the proteins impacting on their turnover and recruitment have been extensively studied. The predominant mechanism by which LCFAs enter cells is still widely debated, as it is unclear whether LCFAs require protein transporters to achieve their transmembrane movement. Various recent reviews summarize the huge body of work that has accumulated on the mechanism of fatty acid transport (2, 145, 315, 339). Multi-imaging mass spectrometry was recently used to monitor intracellular concentrations of free fatty acids and provide new insight into free fatty acid transport in cultured adipocytes. Multi-imaging mass spectrometry can be used to image and quantify stable isotope fatty acids in intracellular lipid droplets (193).

A number of transgenic mice and mice bearing invalidation of the various genes of interest involved at different steps of regulatory pathways concerning glucose and fatty acid transport in the adipocyte have been designed. Such integrative studies have led to a better understanding of the physiology of adipose tissue, allowed the selective alterations in the expression levels of proteins, and highlighted the roles of these genes in the regulation of adipose tissue function; they have also confirmed a number of in vitro results and revealed unexpected original results. For instance, disruption of GLUT4 in adipose tissue has no effect on fat mass but causes impaired

insulin action in muscle and liver (1). Reviews have summarized mouse phenotypes resulting from inactivation or overexpression of genes encoding for molecules responsible for the regulation of adipose tissue metabolism that have led to novel concepts in the understanding of adipocyte biology and its metabolic consequences (35, 371).

### Fat Cell Secretions

Fat cell secretions are not be considered in detail here, since there are a number of recent reviews on the topic. The discovery that the fat cell was able to synthesize and secrete a number of factors and hormones led to a renewed interest in adipose tissue research. Adipose tissue was attaining the status of an endocrine organ and was becoming able, via the numerous factors secreted by adipocytes, to control numerous physiological functions and modulate its own development via paracrine and autocrine regulations of the cells of the SVF.

Briefly, early in the 1990s, it became evident that the adipose tissue was a secretory organ. Adipocytes not only secrete the well-known lipogenic enzyme lipoprotein lipase, but they also secrete other proteins, such as the serine protease adipsin (55, 110) and a mitogen factor (215). Since the discovery of leptin in 1994 (406), it was confirmed that fat tissue has an important endocrine function. Over the past few years following the discovery of leptin, several factors secreted by white adipose tissue, named adipokines, have been identified and characterized. The list steadily increased. The discovery of the hormone adiponectin, also known as adipoQ or ACRP30 (for adipocyte complement-related protein), has initiated extensive investigations in rodent models and in humans. The physiological and pathological role of adiponectin and adiponectin receptors in the peripheral tissues and SNS has been reviewed several times by Kadowaki et al. (184) and is not considered here. Other secreted factors include resistin (also known as FIZZ3), acylation-stimulating protein (C3des-Arg), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, angiotensin II secreted by the renin-angiotensin system of the adipocyte, metallothioneins, the inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-8, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and TNF-α. The secreted fasting-induced adipose factor, also known as PGAR (for PPARγ angiopoietin-related protein) or ANGPTL4 (for angiopoietin-like protein), and apelin were discovered more recently. Autotaxin released by the adipocytes has a lysophospholipase D activity and is involved in the local production of lysophosphatidic acid. It is upregulated during adipocyte differentiation and obesity. Lysophosphatidic acid (1- or 2-acyl-sn-glycerol 3-phosphate) is a simple phospholipid that, via its interactions with G protein-coupled seven-transmembrane receptors, has an intriguing cell biology. In adipose tissue, it controls the proliferation and differentiation of preadipocytes (105). The list of other secreted factors is expanding. There is emerging evidence that adipocyte size is an important determinant of adipokine secretion, and there is a differential expression of pro- and anti-inflammatory factors with increasing adipocyte size. For instance, there is a strong correlation between adipose tissue-derived TNF-α activity and cell size, with large fat cells secreting more TNF-α in rodents (248). Moreover, when exploring secretion activity of small and large adipocytes inside a given fat deposit, expression and secretion of pro-inflammatory adipokines (i.e., leptin, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1) seem to be

related to fat cell hypertrophy (180, 325). The links between adipocyte hypertrophy and differential secretion of adipokines certainly merit more attention. Paracrine factors other than those cited here could be proliferative triggers, secreted by the enlarged fat cells, which could act on preadipocytes and other cell types of the SVF. Detailed studies of the cross talk

This list of productions/secretions originating from adipocyte and/or various cells of the stroma-vascular fraction (SVF) is nonexhaustive. Factors are grouped according to their contribution in the control of major functions. Some productions possess pleiotropic actions and are found in different groups. Diversity of fat cell secretions has been considered several times. PPAR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor. Overviews can be found in various recent review papers (for original references for each factor and detailed biological effects see Refs. 270, 360, 204, and 363).

between adipocytes (e.g., via numerous secreted adipokines) and the other cells of the SVF are expanding rapidly.

The entire topic of fat cell secretions is considered in recent reviews (204, 270, 360, 363). Thus, adipose tissue secretions have been implicated in a variety of different processes, ranging from blood pressure regulation to the control of lipid metabolism and the initiation of insulin-sensitizing effects; major roles are summarized in Table 3. Some adipose tissue-borne factors are known to act as hormones, while many others are limited to an autocrine or paracrine action within the cells of the SVF. An important and new aspect of adipose tissue biology concerns the immune system, which is in the forefront of adipose tissue and obesity-related research. Seminal observations of three separate groups have demonstrated that macrophages, as well as lymphocytes (84), are recruited in the adipose tissue of obese rodents (398) and humans (67, 386). These earlier observations have been confirmed, and several explanations have been proposed to interpret recruitment of these cells and putative physiological significance. First, the opinion of a number of investigators who were working on fat explants and believed that the source of the altered release of cytokines was adipocytes only must be reconsidered. In several reviews, no clear distinction was made between adipocytes and nonfat cells. Recent studies have shown that a number of bioactive molecules and cytokines are, in fact, released from the nonfat cell fraction of adipose tissue (94). It is now clear

that when adipose tissue-related questions are considered, integrative views of adipocyte biology must consider all the putative cross talk with other cell partners of the SVF (i.e., immune cells, ASCs, preadipocytes, and microvascular endothelial cells). Coculture approaches using adipocytes with other cell types, previously mentioned (see Isolated Fat Cell. Optimization of the use of isolated fat cells), will certainly offer some promising opportunities.

The mechanisms controlling the production and secretion of the various factors by adipocytes remain essentially unknown and require further investigations using appropriate fat cell models. Membrane vesicles originating from the plasma membrane via a mechanism morphologically similar to that of a virus budding process have been shown in various living cells. In 1980, globular surface evaginations, referred to as “protrusions” and modulated by lipolytic agents, were described in rat adipocytes, but no functional role was proposed (330). Morphological studies have reported the existence of cytoplasmic projections and cytoplasmic invaginations showing numerous pinocytic vesicles from adipocytes oriented toward the capillary wall in adipocytes of fasting rats during lipid loss (54). Recently, 3T3-L1 and rat primary adipocytes have been shown to secrete adipocyte-derived microvesicles that are composed of milk fat globule-epidermal growth factor 8. These microvesicles secreted by 3T3-L1 adipocytes showed heterogeneity in size and comprised both smaller exosome-like and

PKA, PKG, and cGMP-dependent protein kinase (cGK-I) are involved in target protein phosphorylation [perilipin and hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL)]. Adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) possesses an exclusive triglyceride lipase activity; it is activated by $\alpha\beta$-hydrolase domain-containing protein (ABHD5). Perilipin phosphorylation induces an important physical alteration of the lipid droplet surface that facilitates the action of ATGL and HSL on triglycerides and the initiation of lipolysis. Perilipin phosphorylation also releases ABHD5, the activator of ATGL. HSL phosphorylation promotes its translocation from the cytosol to the surface of the lipid droplet. Monoacylglycerol lipase (MGL) hydrolyzes monoacylglycerols. Docking of adipocyte lipid-binding protein [fatty acid-binding protein (FABP4)] to HSL favors outflow from the cell of nonesterified fatty acids (NEFAs) released by hydrolysis of triglycerides. Glycerol outflow is facilitated by aquaporin-7 in the adipocyte.

C350 HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVES IN FAT CELL BIOLOGY

larger membrane vesicles. Several integral, cytosolic and nuclear proteins such as caveolin-1, c-Src kinase, and heat shock protein 70 were also microvesicle components. Proteomic analysis of the microvesicles revealed that many other proteins, such as extracellular matrix-related proteins (11) and multiple angiogenic factors, were also present (12). The discovery of adipocyte-derived microvesicles might represent a novel component of fat cell biology that must be validated under in vivo conditions.

### Conclusions and Future Trends

The cell biology of adipocytes has led to the discovery of a number of promising concepts, as reported in the present historical perspective. Many of them have been at the origin of studies using other cell systems and have led to the purification of a number of proteins and extended to the cloning of a number of enzymes, transporters, and other factors controlling fat cell function. Knowledge of adipocyte biology has been considerably expanded during the last 50 years. The adipocyte remains a commonly used cell system that possesses a number of plasma membrane receptors controlling lipolysis and a number of other metabolic pathways (211) (Fig. 2). A number of original techniques adapted for those cell studies have been published in two recent books, which contain an overview of the actual and most suitable methods for fat cell investigations (9, 400). Functional differences between fat depots appear to be related to the differences in the cell component of SVF and intrinsic differences in fat cells from different depots. Adipocyte size is of importance in determining metabolic (i.e., lipolytic and lipogenic activity) and endocrine (i.e., leptin and adiponectin release) function. Delineation of adipocyte cross talk with other cells of the SVF of adipose tissue is a recent area of research. Several groups have recently developed a number of coculture studies associating differentiated adipocytes with microvascular endothelial cells and immune cells that exist in adipose tissue. It is an attempt to shift from the biology of a single cell type to an in vitro approach of cell interactions in a given tissue or organ. Cell biology–related research on adipocytes must be associated with the necessary integrative physiology approaches. Furthermore, systems biology has emerged over the past decade, and as “omics” technologies continue to expand, scientists are gaining more tools to interrogate physiological functions and their adaptations.

Adipose tissue is at the center of lipid homeostasis and delivery, and its endocrine functions raise a number of provocative questions. Physiological complexity requires the return toward physiological methods based on the exploration of arteriovenous differences in various fat pads (especially in humans), as developed by Frayn et al. (112) in Oxford. In situ microdialysis has also been a very useful tool for investigation of adipose tissue physiology (205). In addition, methods based on the use of tracers have been expanded to support a number of points raised from fat cell studies (378). The increasing use of genetically engineered mice has led to a new appreciation of metabolic pathways. Whatever the power of cell biology, a number of transgenic studies have been established to clarify the physiological role of adipocyte proteins. Alterations in the expression levels of proteins involved at different steps of regulatory pathways have highlighted the complementary roles of genes in the regulation of adipose tissue function and development (35, 371).
