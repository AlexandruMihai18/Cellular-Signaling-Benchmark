the physiological importance of autophagy in maintaining cell homeostasis in organs such as liver and in cultured cells emerged (Mortimore & Schwerer, 1977) and reviewed by Mortimore and Kadowaki (1994). At the same time, the term autophagic cell death or type II programmed cell death (PCD II) was introduced to describe a cell death different from
logical importance in the liver, and in cultured cells (Blommaart, Luiken, & Meijer, 1997b; Mortimore, Pösö, & Lardeux, 1989; Seglen, 1987). The breakdown of proteins by autophagy produces amino acids and other elements needed for intermediary metabolism and for biosynthetic pathways. Thus,
pathway and/or deficiency in autophagy genes are involved.

Deficiency of the lysosomal protein LAMP-2 was shown to cause Danon disease, an X-linked vacuolar cardiomyopathy and myopathy (Nishino et al., 2000). Inactivation of the lysosomal protein LAMP-
conditions (Harding, Hefnergravink, Thumm, & Klionsky, 1996; Harding, Morano, Scott, & Klionsky, 1995; Hutchins & Klionsky, 2001), while autophagy directs them to the vacuole under starvation (Baba, Osumi, Scott, Klionsky, & Oh
The second conjugation system in yeast is characterized by the conjugation of the protein Atg8 with the phospholipid phosphatidylethanolamine (Ichimura et al., 2000). This system is dependent upon the activity of Atg7 and Atg3, which have a function similar to the E1 and E2 enzymes in the ubiquitin pathway, respectively (Ichimura
Because class III PI3K controls several membrane-transport processes (reviewed in Ref. [Wurmser, Gary, & Emr, 1999]), the regulation of autophagy by the class III PI3K/Beclin 1 awaits identification of mechanisms that control its activity in an autophagy-dependent manner. Recently, amino acid starvation in myotubes was shown to stimulate the activity of
Fig. 3. Regulation of autophagy and implications of tumor-suppressor genes and proto-oncogenes. The kinase mTOR plays a central role in autophagy by integrating class I PI3K-dependent and amino acid-dependent signaling. The involvement of TSC1/TSC2, the monomeric GTPase Rheb (TSC2 is a GTPase activating protein toward Rheb)
Ogier-Denis et al., 1997) and vice versa. This suggests that the Gαi3 protein and its cohort proteins can control the balance between the flow of membrane in the exocytic pathway and can control the delivery of membrane constituents to the macroautophagic pathway. Another interesting point to consider is that, via the control of the activation of the kinase Raf-1, the GAP
and muscle cells AMPK negatively modulates protein synthesis by impairing the mTOR-dependent signaling to p70S6 kinase and 4E-BP1, a binding protein for the translation initiation factor 4E (Bolster, Crozier, Kimball, & Jefferson, 2002; Dubbelhuis & Meijer, 2002a,b; Krause, Ber
4.2.2. Effectors of mTOR in the autophagic pathway

In *S. cerevisiae*, inhibition of TOR is required to control Atg1 kinase-dependent organization of elements on the pre-autophagosomal membrane (Kim, Huang, Stromhaug, & Klionsky, 2002; Mizushima et al., 2001; Suzuki et al.,
