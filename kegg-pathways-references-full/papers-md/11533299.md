ABSTRACT During normal acid-base balance, the kidney extracts very little of the plasma glutamine. However, during metabolic acidosis, as much as one third of the plasma glutamine is extracted and metabolized in a single pass through this organ. The substantial increase in renal utilization occurs solely within the proximal convoluted tubule and is sustained by compensating adaptations in the intraorgan metabolism of glutamine. The primary pathway for renal glutamine metabolism involves its transport into mitochondria and its deamidation and deamination by glutaminase (GA) and glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH), respectively. The resulting ammonium ions are excreted predominantly in the urine where they function as expendable cations to facilitate the excretion of acids. The resulting α-ketoglutarate is further metabolized to phosphoenol/pyruvate and subsequently to glucose or CO₂. The intermediate steps yield two bicarbonate ions that are selectively transported into the venous blood to partially compensate the metabolic acidosis. In rat kidney, this adaptation is sustained in part by the cell-specific induction of the glutaminase that results primarily from stabilization of the GA mRNA. The 3′-nontranslated region of the GA mRNA contains a direct repeat of an 8-base AU-sequence that functions as a pH-response element. This sequence exhibits a high affinity and specificity for zeta (z)-crystallin. The same protein binds to two separate, but homologous, 8-base AU-sequences within the 3′-nontranslated region of the GDH mRNA. The apparent binding activity of z-crystallin is increased significantly during onset of metabolic acidosis. Thus, increased binding of z-crystallin may initiate the pH-responsive stabilization of the two mRNAs. J. Nutr. 131: 2491S–2495S, 2001.

Renal glutamine metabolism

In contrast to other tissues in which glutamine metabolism is largely constitutive, the renal catabolism of glutamine is acutely activated in response to the onset of metabolic acidosis. During normal acid-base balance, the kidney extracts and metabolizes very little of the plasma glutamine (Squires et al. 1976). The measured renal arterial-venous difference for plasma glutamine is normally < 0.03. However, ~20% of the plasma glutamine is filtered by the glomeruli and enters the lumen of the nephron. The filtered glutamine is reabsorbed primarily by the epithelial cells of the proximal convoluted tubule (Silbernagl 1980). The glutamine is initially transported across the apical brush border membrane, and subsequently, most of the recovered glutamine is returned to the blood via transport across the basolateral membrane. The specific transporters that are responsible for the transcellular flux of glutamine have not been identified.

Utilization of the small fraction of extracted plasma glutamine requires its transport into the mitochondrial matrix where glutamine is deamidated by glutaminase (GA)³ and then oxidatively deaminated by glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH). Glutamine uptake occurs via a mersyl-sensitive electroneutral uniporter (Sastrasinh and Sastrasinh 1989). The mitochondrial glutamine transporter was recently purified from rat kidney and shown by reconstitution in lipid vesicles to be specific for glutamine and asparagine and inhibited by various thiol reagents (Indiveri et al. 1998). Kinetic measurements indicated that the rate of glutamine transport in isolated rat renal mitochondria is not rate limiting for glutamine catabolism (Goldstein and Boylan 1978, Kovacevic and Bajin 1982). However, either the activity of the mitochondrial glutamine transporter or the glutaminase must be largely inactivated in vivo during normal acid-base balance to account for the effective reabsorption of glutamine. During normal acid-base balance, approximately two thirds of the ammonium ions produced from glutamine are trapped in the tubular lumen and excreted in a slightly acidified urine.

Rat kidney also expresses significant levels of γ-glutamyltranspeptidase, an enzyme that catalyzes a phosphate-independent glutaminase activity (Curthoys and Kuhlenschmidt 1975). However, this enzyme is localized primarily to the brush border membrane of the proximal straight tubules (Curthoys and Lowry 1973), a site that is distal to the recovery of the filtered glutamine. Furthermore, the in vivo inhibition of

γ-glutamyltranspeptidase (Scott and Curthoys 1987) causes a pronounced glutathioneuria, but has little effect on renal ammoniagenesis. Thus, this enzyme functions primarily to degrade filtered and secreted glutathione (Curthoys 1983) and is unlikely to contribute significantly to the renal catabolism of glutamine.

### Acute acidosis

The maintenance of blood acid-base balance is essential for survival. Increased renal ammoniagenesis and gluconeogenesis from plasma glutamine constitute an adaptive response that partially restores acid-base balance during metabolic acidosis (Brosnan et al. 1988). Thus, the renal catabolism of glutamine is rapidly activated after the acute onset of metabolic acidosis (Fig. 1). Within 1–3 h, the arterial plasma glutamine concentration is increased twofold (Hughey et al. 1980) due primarily to an increased release of glutamine from muscle tissue (Schrock et al. 1980). Significant renal extraction of glutamine becomes evident as the arterial plasma concentration is increased. Net extraction reaches 30% of the plasma glutamine, a level that exceeds the percentage filtered by the glomeruli. Thus, the direction of the basolateral glutamine transport must be reversed for the proximal convoluted tubule cells to extract glutamine from both the glomerular filtrate and the venous blood. In addition, the transport of glutamine into the mitochondria may be acutely activated. Further responses include a prompt acidification of the urine that results from an acute activation of the apical Na⁺/H⁺ antiporter activity (Horie et al. 1990). This process facilitates the rapid removal of cellular ammonium ions (Tannen and Ross 1979) and ensures that the bulk of the ammonium ions generated in the proximal tubule are excreted in the urine. Finally, a pH-induced activation of α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase reduces the intracellular concentrations of α-ketoglutarate and glutamate (Lowry and Ross 1980). Thus, increased catabolism initially results from a rapid activation of key transport processes, an increased availability of glutamine, and a decreased concentration of the products of the glutaminase and glutamate dehydrogenase reactions.

### Chronic acidosis

During chronic metabolic acidosis, many of the acute adaptations are partially compensated and the arterial plasma glutamine concentration is decreased to 70% of normal (Brosnan et al. 1988). However, the kidney continues to extract more than one third of the total plasma glutamine (Squires et al. 1976) in a single pass through this organ (Fig. 2). Renal catabolism of glutamine is now sustained by increased expression of the genes that encode the mitochondrial glutaminase (Curthoys and Lowry 1973) and glutamate dehydrogenase (Wright and Knepper 1990a), the cytoplasmic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) (Burch et al. 1978), and the mitochondrial glutamine, the apical Na⁺/H⁺ and the basolateral Na⁺-3HCO₃⁻ transport systems (Preisig and Alpern 1988). All of these adaptations occur solely within the renal proximal convoluted tubule. The coordinate increase in enzyme activities facilitates the continued catabolism of glutamine. The concomitant increase in the apical Na⁺/H⁺ antiporter activity sustains the acidification of the fluid in the tubular lumen and ensures the urinary excretion of the ammonium ions. Thus, the increased renal ammoniagenesis continues to provide an expendable cation that facilitates the excretion of titratable acids while conserving sodium and potassium ions. The increased Na⁺/H⁺ antiporter activity also promotes the tubular reabsorption of HCO₃⁻ ions. In addition, the α-ketoglutarate generated from glutamine is converted to glucose. This process generates 2 mol of HCO₃⁻ ions per mole of α-ketoglutarate. An increase in the basolateral Na⁺-3HCO₃⁻ cotransporter activity facilitates the translocation of reabsorbed and de novo synthesized HCO₃⁻ ions into the renal venous blood. Thus, the combined adaptations also

### Properties of the mitochondrial glutaminase

In normal rat kidney, the mitochondrial glutaminase activity is greatest in the distal portions of the nephron, intermediate in the proximal convoluted tubule and very low in glomeruli and proximal straight tubules (Curthoys and Lowry 1973). Within 24 h after the onset of acidosis, the glutaminase activity is increased twofold within the proximal convoluted tubule. However, due to the cell specificity of the increase and the greater level of activity associated with distal tubules, 2–3 d are required to observe a significant increase in glutaminase activity in crude homogenates of whole kidney. The total renal glutaminase activity increases gradually and eventually reaches a plateau after 7 d of acidosis at a value that is four- to fivefold greater than normal. The maximal induction is due to a 7- to 20-fold increase within the proximal convoluted tubule (Curthoys and Lowry 1973, Wright and Knepper 1990b).

Immunologic experiments have established that the increase in renal glutaminase activity is due to the presence of an increased amount of protein and not to an activation of preexisting enzyme (Curthoys et al. 1976). The relative rate of renal synthesis of glutaminase was determined by pulse-labeling experiments (Tong et al. 1986). After the onset of acidosis, the relative rate of glutaminase synthesis increased gradually and reached a plateau within 5 d at a value that was 5.3-fold greater than normal. The apparent half-lives for glutaminase degradation measured in normal and acidotic rats were nearly identical. Thus, the stimulation of glutaminase synthesis accounts for the fivefold increase in glutaminase activity. Acute recovery from chronic acidosis causes a rapid decrease in the relative rate of glutaminase synthesis and in renal ammonia genesis. However, the level of glutaminase activity decreases gradually and requires 10–12 d to return to normal (Parry and Brosnan 1978). Therefore, the in vivo flux through the glu-

of transcription of the renal GA gene is unaffected by alterations in acid-base balance (Hwang and Curthoys 1991, Hwang et al. 1991). Thus, the increase in glutaminase activity during chronic acidosis results from increased levels of total and translatable GA mRNAs that apparently occur due to an increased stability of the GA mRNA.

Stabilization of GA mRNA

The selective stabilization of the GA mRNA was initially demonstrated by stable transfection of various β-globin (βG) constructs (Hansen et al. 1996) into LLC-PK₁-FBPase⁺ cells, a pH-responsive porcine proximal tubule-like cell line (Gstraunthaler and Handler 1987). Expression of pβG produced a high level of a very stable mRNA (t½ > 30 h) that was not affected by transfer of the cells to acidic medium (pH

6.9, 10 mmol HCO₃⁻). In contrast, pβG-GA, which encodes an additional 956-base segment of the 3′-nontranslated region of the GA mRNA, was expressed at significantly lower levels. The decreased expression resulted from the more rapid turnover (t½ = 4.6 h) of the βG-GA mRNA. Transfer of the latter cells to acidic medium resulted in a pronounced stabilization (sixfold) and a gradual induction of the βG-GA mRNA. These studies indicated that the 3′-nontranslated region of the GA mRNA contains a pH-response element (pH-RE).

Experiments using additional chimeric βG constructs indicated that a 340-base segment of the GA mRNA, termed R-2, retained most of the functional characteristics of the 3′-nontranslated region (Laterza et al. 1997). Mapping studies, using RNA gel-shift assays, demonstrated that the specific binding site within the R-2 RNA consisted of a direct repeat of an 8-base AU-sequence. Site-directed mutation of the direct repeat of the 8-base AU-sequence completely abolished the pH-responsive stabilization of the βG-GA mRNA (Laterza and Curthoys 2000a). A βG reporter construct that contained the 3′-nontranslated region of the PEPCK mRNA, pβG-PCK, was designed to further test the function of the AU-element. When expressed in LLC-PK₁-FBPase⁺ cells, the half-life of the βG-PCK mRNA was only slightly stabilized (1.3-fold) by growth in acidic medium. However, insertion of short segments of GA cDNA containing either the direct repeat or a single 8-base AU-sequence was sufficient to impart a fivefold pH-responsive stabilization to the chimeric mRNA. Thus, either the direct repeat or a single copy of the 8-base AU-sequence is both necessary and sufficient to function as a pH-RE.

The apparent binding to the pH-RE is increased threefold in cytosolic extracts prepared from LLC-PK₁-FBPase⁺ cells that were grown in acidic medium (Laterza and Curthoys 2000b). Extracts prepared from the renal cortex of rats that were made acutely acidotic also exhibit a similar increase in binding to the direct repeat of the pH-RE. The time course for the increase in binding correlates with the temporal increase in GA mRNA. Scatchard analysis indicates that the increased binding is due to an increase in both the affinity and the maximal binding of the pH-RE binding protein.

FIGURE 4 Proposed model for the mechanism by which the onset of metabolic acidosis leads to stabilization of the renal glutaminase (GA) mRNA. The 8-base AU-rich pH-response element (pH-RE) recruits a sequence-specific endoribonuclease and serves as a binding site for zeta (z)-crystallin. In normal acid-base balance, the weak binding of z-crystallin allows for the rapid degradation of the GA mRNA. During metabolic acidosis, the increased binding of z-crystallin blocks recruitment of the endoribonuclease and leads to stabilization of the GA mRNA.

was used as an affinity ligand to purify a 36-kDa protein from rat renal cortex (Tang and Curthoys 2001). The isolated protein retained the same specific binding properties as observed with crude cytosolic extracts. Microsequencing of the purified protein by mass spectroscopy yielded eight peptides that are contained in mouse zeta (z)-crystallin. In addition, three peptides that differed by a single amino acid from sequences found in mouse z-crystallin were identified. The observed differences may represent substitutions found in the rat homolog. Specific antibodies to z-crystallin supershifted the complex formed between the pH-RE and the purified protein. The 3′-nontranslated region of the GDH mRNA contains four 8-base AU-rich segments in which 7 of the 8 bases are identical to the pH-RE sequence identified in the GA mRNA. The purified z-crystallin binds to two of these sequences with high affinity and specificity (Schroeder and Curthoys, unpublished data). Thus, increased binding of z-crystallin to the GA and GDH mRNAs may initiate their stabilization and increased expression during acidosis.

The cumulative data are consistent with the following model (Fig. 4). In normal acid-base balance, the pH-RE present in the 3′-nontranslated region of the GA mRNA recruits a site-specific endoribonuclease. The onset of metabolic acidosis causes an increase in the binding affinity of z-crystallin for the pH-RE. This, in turn, confers increased protection to the GA mRNA from endonucleolytic cleavage and results in an increased stabilization of the GA mRNA. This hypothesis represents the simplest interpretation of the available data. However, the current data do not rule out more complex mechanisms. Further characterization of the actual mechanism will be facilitated through the development of in vitro mRNA decay assays and the use of recombinant z-crystallin.
