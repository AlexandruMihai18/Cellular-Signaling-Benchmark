Saha, Asish K., Theodore G. Kurowski, Jerry R. Colca, and Neil B. Ruderman. Lipid abnormalities in tissues of the KKAY mouse: effects of pioglitazone on malonyl-CoA and diacylglycerol. Am. J. Physiol. 267 (Endocrinol. Metab. 30): E95–E101, 1994.—Insulin resistance is present in liver and muscle of subjects with type 2 diabetes and obesity. Recent studies suggest that such insulin resistance could be related to abnormalities in lipid-mediated signal transduction; however, the nature of these abnormalities is unclear. To examine this question further, tissue levels of diacylglycerol (DAG), malonyl-CoA, and triglyceride (TG) were determined in liver and soleus muscle of obese insulin-resistant KKAY mice and lean C57 BL control mice. In addition, the effects of treatment with pioglitazone, an antidiabetic agent that acts by increasing insulin sensitivity in muscle, liver, and other tissues, were assessed. The KKAY mice were hyperglycemic (407 vs. 138 mg/dl), hypertriglyceridemic (337 vs. 109 mg/dl), hyperinsulinemic (631 vs. 15 mU/ml), and weighed more (42 vs. 35 g) than the control mice. They also had 1.5- to 2.0-fold higher levels of malonyl-CoA in both liver and muscle, higher DAG (twofold) and TG (1.3-fold) levels in muscle, and higher TG (threefold), but not DAG, levels in liver. Treatment of the KKAY mice with pioglitazone for 4 days decreased plasma glucose, TGs, and insulin by ~50% and restored hepatic and muscle malonyl-CoA levels to control values. In contrast, pioglitazone increased hepatic and muscle DAG levels two- or threefold. It had no effect on muscle or hepatic TG content, and it slightly increased hepatic TGs in the control group. The results indicate that abnormalities in tissue lipids occur in both liver and muscle of the KKAY mouse and that they are differentially altered when insulin sensitivity is enhanced by treatment with pioglitazone. Improved insulin sensitivity correlated most closely with reduction in the content of malonyl-CoA, suggesting a possible link between the cytosolic concentration of long chain fatty acyl-CoA and insulin action.

Diacylglycerol (DAG) is both an intermediate in the synthesis of triglycerides and phospholipids and an activator of protein kinase C (PKC). Increases in its content have been observed in insulin-resistant skeletal muscle of the genetically obese, hyperinsulinemic (fa/fa) rat (32) and ob/ob mouse (unpublished observations), in rat skeletal muscle after denervation (21, 39), and in cardiac muscle of diabetic rats (31). In denervated muscle, the increase in DAG content is associated with inhibition of insulin-stimulated glycogen synthesis and two- to threefold increases in insulin-stimulated glucose incorporation into DAG and membrane-associated PKC activity (21). Because PKC has been shown to phosphorylate and inhibit the insulin receptor (25) and glycogen synthase (1), it has been proposed as a possible link between altered lipid signaling and insulin resistance (20, 21).

In searching for the basis for this increase in DAG synthesis in denervated muscle and for the increase in DAG mass in the various situations associated with insulin resistance in muscle, we have focused our attention on factors that could increase the concentration of cytosolic long chain fatty acyl-CoA (LCFA-CoA), a substrate for DAG synthesis. One of these factors, malonyl-CoA, is both an intermediate in the pathway of fatty acid synthesis and a physiological inhibitor of carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT I) (26). In liver, when malonyl-CoA levels are high (e.g., in fasted-refed rats), CPT I is inhibited and the transport of LCFA-CoA into the mitochondria and its subsequent oxidation are diminished. Under these conditions, the level of cytosolic LCFA-CoA in the cytosol is increased, and it is utilized to a greater extent for the synthesis of DAG and other lipids than for oxidation (11). Muscle also possesses malonyl-CoA, and its concentration is diminished in response to both exercise (14) and starvation (27), two situations in which fatty acid oxidation is increased. Its role here, as in the pancreatic β-cell (5), appears to be solely as a regulator of CPT I, because fatty acid synthesis in muscle is negligible (21). How malonyl-CoA changes in relation to DAG content in insulin-resistant muscle and liver is not known. In the present study, we have addressed this question by using the genetically obese, hyperinsulinemic, and insulin-resistant KKAY mouse as a model. This report compares the levels of DAG, malonyl-CoA, and triglycerides in muscle and liver of these mice and of lean C57 BL control mice. In addition, the effects of pioglitazone, an antidiabetic agent that reduces insulin resistance in both humans with type 2 diabetes (10) and a variety of insulin-resistant rodents (10), is described.

INSULIN RESISTANCE in skeletal muscle is present in humans with type 2 diabetes [non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM)] and obesity and in rodents with these disorders (12). Muscle also becomes insulin resistant after denervation (6). In obesity and NIDDM, a decrease in the number of insulin receptors and a reduction in receptor kinase activity (17, 19, 20, 28) have been demonstrated; however, they do not fully account for the decreased ability of insulin to stimulate glucose transport or glycogen synthesis. In denervated muscle, decreases in neither insulin receptor number nor receptor tyrosine kinase activity have been found (6). For these reasons, insulin resistance in all of these disorders has been attributed, at least in part, to an undefined defect in signal transduction at a site distal to the insulin receptor (6).

E96 INSULIN RESISTANCE AND TISSUE LIPID ABNORMALITIES

MATERIALS AND METHODS

**Experimental Animals**

Obese male KKA<sup>y</sup> mice, 10–12 wk of age, were obtained from the Upjohn colony. These mice are a cross between glucose-intolerant black KK female mice and obese yellow male A<sup>y</sup> mice; the yellow offspring KKA<sup>y</sup> are obese and insulin resistant (7). Nondiabetic control C57 BL male mice of the same age were obtained from Charles River Laboratories (Portage, MI). Mice were housed individually in cages and provided Purina mouse chow and water ad libitum. Purina Rodent Chow 5015 was powdered and repelleted (control chow) or repelleted after mixture with 0.2 mg/g pioglitazone hydrochloride. Rats on the latter diet ingest ~20 mg·kg<sup>-1</sup>·day<sup>-1</sup> of pioglitazone, an amount that produces a maximal pharmacological effect over 4 days of treatment.

**Collection of Blood and Tissue**

At 800 h on the day of death, blood was taken from unanesthetized animals by orbital sinus puncture for determination of blood glucose and plasma insulin and triglycerides. After this, the mice were anesthetized and killed by decapitation. The soleus muscles and a piece of liver were excised and frozen with stainless steel tongs cooled in liquid nitrogen. Tissue samples were transferred to dry ice and stored at –70°C until analyzed. All procedures in this study are in compliance with the animal welfare act regulations (9 CFR, parts 1, 2, and 3) and with the “Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals” (DHEW publication 85–23, 1985).

**Assays**

Blood glucose was measured with a glucose autoanalyzer (Alpkem, Clackamas, OR) and insulin by radioimmunoassay using bovine standard. Plasma triglycerides were determined with a Demand autoanalyzer (Olympus, Clinical Instruments, Lake Success, NY) and tissue triglycerides by a modification of the procedure of Denton and Randle (13) in which triglyceride concentration in the lipid extract is determined with a semienzymatic assay kit (Sigma Chemical, St. Louis, MO). DAG was measured enzymatically by the method of Preiss et al. (33). Malonyl-CoA was assayed radioenzymatically by the method of McGarry et al. (27), which measures malonyl-CoA-dependent incorporation of [³H]acetyl-CoA into fatty acids. The fatty acid synthetase required for the assay was isolated from rat liver.

**Statistics**

Values are expressed as means ± SE. Statistical significance was assessed by group comparison using Student’s *t* test and by one-way analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni correction, where *P* < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

RESULTS

**Comparison of KKA<sup>y</sup> and Control Mice**

Blood glucose and plasma triglyceride concentrations were threefold higher, and plasma insulin levels were 40-fold higher in the KKA<sup>y</sup> than in the C57 BL control mice (Table 1). Body weight was also significantly greater in the KKA<sup>y</sup> mice, in keeping with their previously documented obesity (7). As shown in Table 2, the concentration of malonyl-CoA was increased by 100% in both liver and soleus muscle in the KKA<sup>y</sup> animals. The content of DAG was twofold higher in the soleus muscle of the KKA<sup>y</sup> than in that of the C57 BL mice; however,

no difference in DAG content was observed in the liver of the two groups.

**Effects of Pioglitazone**

**Plasma constituents and body weight.** Treatment with pioglitazone (20 mg/kg body wt) for 4 days before death decreased the initially high levels of blood glucose and plasma triglycerides in the KKA<sup>y</sup> mice to values approaching, but still somewhat higher than, those of the untreated control mice (Fig. 1, A and B). Pioglitazone also lowered the plasma insulin concentration by 50% in the KKA<sup>y</sup> mice (Fig. 1C); however, insulin levels were still tenfold greater than those of the untreated C57 BL group. In the control mice, pioglitazone caused modest but significant decreases in both plasma insulin and triglycerides, but it had no effect on blood glucose levels. It did not significantly alter body weight in either group.

**Tissue DAG and malonyl-CoA.** In KKA<sup>y</sup> mice treated with pioglitazone, the elevated concentrations of malonyl-CoA in both liver and muscle decreased to values insignificantly different from those of the C57 BL mice (Fig. 2, A and B). No effect of pioglitazone on the concentration of malonyl-CoA was observed in either tissue in the control group.

Pioglitazone had a strikingly different effect on DAG content. Instead of decreasing the content of this metabolite, as it did that of malonyl-CoA, pioglitazone increased the content of DAG two- to threefold in both the muscle and liver of the KKA<sup>y</sup> mice (Fig. 3, A and B). It had no effect on DAG content in either tissue in the C57 BL control mice.

**Muscle and liver triglycerides.** Recent studies have linked increases in muscle triglyceride content with

As shown in Fig. 4, the triglyceride content of the soleus was greater by 25% (Fig. 4A), and the triglyceride content of the liver was greater by 175% (Fig. 4B) in the KKAY than in the control mice. In neither group were muscle triglycerides significantly altered by pioglitazone. In

liver, the 4 days of pioglitazone treatment tended to increase triglyceride content in both groups, although only in the control rats was the increase statistically significant.

## DISCUSSION

The results indicate that significant abnormalities in lipid-signaling molecules and in triglyceride content are present in both soleus muscle and liver of the insulin-resistant KKAy mouse. In muscle, malonyl-CoA and DAG levels were increased twofold and triglyceride content was increased by 25% compared with values in control mice. Presumably the increase in malonyl-CoA would also have increased the concentration of cytosolic LCFA-CoA by inhibiting its transport into the mitochondria; however, this was not directly assessed.

The relation of these changes in lipid metabolites and triglycerides in the KKAy mouse to the insulin resistance in its muscle remains to be determined. Our starting hypothesis was that increases in DAG mass and PKC activity would play a key role. However, treatment with pioglitazone, which increases insulin sensitivity in

The possibility that the increase in insulin sensitivity caused by pioglitazone leads to an increase in the activity of glycerol phosphate acyl transferase (15) or another rate-limiting step in DAG synthesis also needs to be explored.

The lipid parameter in muscle that most closely paralleled its sensitivity to insulin was the concentration of malonyl-CoA. The concentration of malonyl-CoA in muscle and liver is thought to be determined primarily by plasma levels of insulin and glucose, both of which increase acetyl-CoA carboxylase activity (24). The results of this and related studies (14, 40) suggest that other factors are also operative. Thus, in the present study, the concentration of malonyl-CoA returned to control values in KKAY mice treated with pioglitazone, even though the decreases in plasma insulin and glucose in these mice left them with insulin levels still substantially higher than those of control animals. In another study we found elevated levels of malonyl-CoA in muscle after denervation (control, 2.0 ± 0.2 vs. denervated, 3.9 ± 0.6 nmol/g, n = 4) and in hypertriglyceridemic Dahl salt-sensitive rats (control, 3.4 ± 0.2 vs. Dahl, 5.1 ± 0.5 nmol/g, n = 5) (unpublished observations); in neither of these were plasma insulin levels significantly

muscle of the KKAY mouse (22, 37), caused a threefold increase in its DAG mass rather than decreasing it. This does not rule out a link between the DAG-PKC signaling system and insulin resistance, although it does argue against it. The possibility remains that pioglitazone increased DAG in a pool different from that which was increased in the muscle of the untreated KKAY mouse. In this context, recent studies from our laboratory (8) suggest the existence of a rapidly turning-over pool of newly synthesized DAG in which the glycerol moiety is derived from glucose. The pool appears to be insulin responsive, it comprises a small fraction of total tissue DAG, and it contains a disproportionately high percentage of relatively rare DAG species with C18:2 and C20:4 fatty acyl chains. In addition, the insulin-induced increase in the size of this pool is two- to threefold greater in denervated than in control muscle, in parallel with its increase in membrane-associated PKC activity. Whether pioglitazone decreases the size of this pool [e.g., secondary to its effect on malonyl-CoA (see Fig. 2A)] at the same time that it causes DAG to be generated from another source (e.g., phospholipid hydrolysis secondary to phospholipase C activation) remains to be determined, as does the effect of pioglitazone on PKC activity.

higher than in control rats (Table 3). Furthermore, in the Dahl rats, pioglitazone therapy for 3 wk decreased the elevated plasma triglyceride and muscle malonyl-CoA concentrations to control values without producing any significant changes in either plasma insulin or glucose (unpublished observations). These findings suggest that pioglitazone may decrease acetyl-CoA carboxylase or another determinant of tissue malonyl-CoA.

On the basis of findings of this study and that in denervated muscle (21), an hypothesis linking changes in cytosolic lipids to insulin resistance can be proposed. As shown in Fig. 5, increases in the concentration of malonyl-CoA inhibit CPT I, the enzyme that catalyzes the rate-limiting step for LCFA-CoA transport into the mitochondria. This in turn should increase the concentration of LCFA-CoA in the cytosol. Such increases in cytosolic LCFA-CoA could hypothetically affect insulin action by at least four mechanisms: 1) by inhibiting glycogen synthase (41), 2) by acylating proteins (38), 3) by altering regulatory elements of specific genes (35), and 4) by activating a specific PKC isozyme (29) either directly or by increasing the de novo synthesis of DAG.

One of the potentially attractive features of the proposed scheme (Fig. 5) is that it suggests a common basis for the insulin resistance of muscle associated with both hyperinsulinemia-hyperglycemia and increases in plasma free fatty acids (FFA). Many investigators have shown that, on raising plasma FFA levels, insulin-stimulated glucose uptake by muscle is inhibited within several hours, and glycogen synthase activity is depressed (3, 16). Tissue levels of LCFA-CoA were not measured in these studies; however, their concentration

is increased in muscle of fat-fed insulin-resistant rodents (9) in which plasma FFA levels are high postprandially. If, as is likely, cytosolic LCFA-CoA levels are increased in both these muscles and in muscles in which malonyl-CoA levels are increased (Fig. 5), changes in the concentration of cytosolic LCFA-CoA could be the common factor associated with insulin resistance in the two situations. The observation that inhibitors of CPT I (e.g., etomoxir), which should increase cytosolic LCFA-CoA levels, can enhance insulin-stimulated glucose uptake by muscle (18) argues against this notion. On the other hand, the possibility that such inhibitors have other effects on insulin action that overcome an inhibitory effect of LCFA-CoA (2) has not been examined.

Muscle triglyceride content was 25% greater in the KKAy than in the control mice. Storlein et al. (36) showed that the triglyceride content of muscle is a strong correlate of its resistance to insulin in fat-fed rats. We would propose that this correlation occurs because intracellular FFA or cytosolic LCFA-CoA, derived from triglyceride hydrolysis, contributes to insulin resistance. In the present study, treatment with pioglitazone for 4 days did not significantly affect muscle triglyceride content; however, its effect on triglyceride turnover was not studied.

Changes in the concentration of malonyl-CoA in liver in control and pioglitazone-treated KKAy mice paralleled those in muscle, suggesting similar signaling alteration in the two tissues. In contrast to that of muscle, the DAG content of liver was not increased in the KKAy mouse, although, as in muscle, it did increase several-fold as a result of treatment with pioglitazone. Hepatic

Fig. 5. Hypothetical common mechanism by which fat feeding, hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycemia, and denervation could lead to insulin resistance in skeletal muscle. Common denominator is an increase in concentration of long chain fatty acyl (LCFA)-CoA in cytosol. Such an increase can occur when muscle cell is presented with excess free fatty acids (FFA), hydrolysis of muscle triglyceride (TG) is increased, and/or LCFA-CoA transport into mitochondria is inhibited by malonyl-CoA. Increase in cytosolic LCFA-CoA by virtue of its effects on DAG-protein kinase C (PKC) and other signaling, glycogen synthase, and/or expression of specific genes could lead to insulin resistance.

triglyceride content was increased nearly threefold in the KKAY mouse, suggesting that the increase in plasma triglycerides was probably secondary, at least in part, to increased hepatic triglyceride synthesis. Pioglitazone significantly increased hepatic triglyceride content in the control mice but not in the KKAY group. In another study, pioglitazone administered for 3 wk to hypertriglyceridemic, male, Dahl salt-sensitive rats significantly decreased triglyceride content in the liver (8.2 ± 0.9 vs. 5.9 ± 0.5 mmol/g, n = 6) (unpublished observations). Whether differences in species or the duration of drug use account for the different results in the two studies remains to be determined.

In summary, the concentrations of DAG, malonyl-CoA, and triglyceride are increased in muscle and liver of the insulin-resistant KKAY mouse. Administration of pioglitazone under conditions that have been reported to increase insulin action in muscle (22) and liver (23) diminishes the concentration of malonyl-CoA and increases that of DAG. Whether these metabolite changes contribute mechanistically to the associated alterations in insulin action, or whether they are the consequence of these alterations, remains to be determined.

**NOTE ADDED IN PROOF**

After this paper was submitted for publication, D. R. Cooper, J. E. Watson, and M. L. Dao [Decreased expression of protein kinase-C α, β, and ξ in soleus muscle of Zucker obese (fa/fa) rats. Endocrinology 133: 2241–2247, 1993] reported increased levels of diacylglycerol in the soleus muscle of the obese Zucker rat. This was associated with decrease in mRNA, protein, and enzyme activity of several protein kinase C isoforms.
