## Abstract

The purpose of this review is to update the reader on our current understanding of the uptake and secretion of dietary lipid by the enterocyte to the periphery. This is a multi-stage process that first involves luminal digestion, followed by cellular uptake and processing, and subsequent extracellular transport of chylomicrons. We discuss the importance of acid and pancreatic lipase in lipid digestion. Micellar solubilization of fatty acids and 2-mono-acyl glycerol is critical to uptake by enhancing enterocyte exposure. There is controversy regarding the mechanism of fatty acid uptake by the enterocyte and whether this is mediated by a carrier-dependent process. The mechanism of fatty acid transport to the endoplasmic reticulum is discussed including the role of fatty acid binding proteins. Intracellularly, 2-monoacylglycerol and fatty acid are reconstituted to form triacylglycerol by the action of MGAT and DGAT. We focus on the mechanisms of intracellular chylomicron formation and secretion into lymph. Chylomicron and VLDL particles differ not only by an operational definition but likely represent two distinct pathways of intestinal lipoprotein formation. The physiologic role of apo B-48 in the intestine is presented as well as clinical disease of chylomicron metabolism, specifically abetalipoproteinemia and Anderson’s disease.

## 1. Introduction

The major purpose of this review is to update our current understanding of the luminal digestion, cellular uptake and processing, and subsequent extracellular transport of dietary lipids. Specifically, this discussion will be focused on the formation and secretion of chylomicrons (CM) by the enterocyte and how this process is regulated. Dietary fat contributes as much as 30% of the total calories used by the body. The major component of dietary fat is triacylglycerol (TG) which contains a glycerol molecule esterified to three fatty acids (FA). In addition to TG, dietary lipids also include phospholipids and cholesterol. Beyond dietary sources, the liver contributes to endogenous sources of luminal phospholipids and cholesterol with the secretion of bile. Due to rapid enterocyte turnover in the intestine, approximately every 72 h, enterocytes can also add to the luminal lipid pool primarily in the form of cell membrane-derived phospholipid and cholesterol.

## 2. Digestion of dietary lipid

The major digestion products of TG are diacylglycerol (DG) and fatty acids. In humans, the digestion of dietary TG begins in the stomach by the enzyme acid lipase. As the name implies, this enzyme works best in an acidic medium (pH 3–6). Unlike humans, acid lipase is secreted in the salivary secretions of rodents. It has been determined that animals have a dominant form of acid lipase, lingual or gastric, but not both [1]. The action of gastric acid lipase is particularly important in neonates and infants, as the pancreatic lipase system has yet to become fully functional [2]. In addition, milk fat, the primary source of nourishment for infants, contains considerable medium-chain TGs which work more efficiently with acid lipase than long-chain TGs. In adults, acid lipase also plays an important role in the digestion of lipids by providing partial glycerides and FA, which promote the emulsification of TGs. Emulsification in the stomach is important since pancreatic lipase, which hydrolyzes the rest of the TGs and partial glycerides in the intestinal lumen, works only at the water and oil interface [3]. Consequently, the better the fat is emulsified, the more efficient the rate of hydrolysis in the intestinal lumen.

Through the use of labeled TG, Mattson and colleagues demonstrated that pancreatic lipase acts mainly on the sn-1 and sn-3 positions of the TG molecule to release 2-monoacylglycerol (2-MG) and two, free FAs [4–6]. 1-Monoacylglycerol (1-MG) can also be formed from 2-MG through isomerization, and 1- or 2-MG can be further hydrolyzed by pancreatic lipase in the lumen to form glycerol and a FA [7]. However, 2-MG is probably the predominant form in which MG is absorbed since the formation of 1-MG or degradation of both isoforms occurs slower than the uptake of 2-MG by the small intestine [8].

## 3. Uptake of lipid digestion products by the enterocyte

The studies of Hofmann and Borgstrom [9,10] suggested that the micellar solubilization of FA and 2-MG was critical to their uptake by an enterocyte. The question was why? The studies by Dietschy and colleagues provided the answer to this question [11–13]. They found that the brush-border membrane of the enterocyte was separated from the bulk aqueous phase in the intestinal lumen by an unstirred water layer. The bulk aqueous phase in the intestinal lumen mixed poorly with the unstirred water layer. Consequently, the solute molecules in the bulk phase could only be taken up by the enterocytes by diffusing across the unstirred water layer. Due to the low aqueous solubility of FA and MG, very few molecules could reach the brush-border membrane.

Micellar solubilization of MG and FA greatly enhances the number of molecules available for enterocyte uptake. If micellar solubilization of FA and MG is so important to their uptake, how can patients with bile salt deficiency take up FA and MG from the intestinal lumen? The answer is that instead of a mixed, bile salt micelle, the lipid vesicle, as proposed by Carey et al., can also deliver FA and 2-MG to the enterocyte for uptake [14]. A liquid, crystalline vesicle (liposome) forms when the bile salt concentration in the lumen is insufficient to solubilize the amount of lipid present. Liposomes have a hydrodynamic radii of 400–600 Å [14,15]. The relative role of the micelle and the liposome in the uptake of FA and MG as well as other lipid soluble molecules is complex. In bile diverted rats installed with a duodenal infusion cannula, we infused human intraluminal contents. We showed that the uptake of FA from the intestinal lumen can be mediated by both micelles as well as vesicles, but the uptake of cholesterol is solely by micelles [15].

Due to the potential therapeutic application, there is great controversy and continued debate regarding the mechanisms of uptake for FA. Although it is beyond the scope of this review to discuss the controversy in detail, we do favor the concept that the mechanism of uptake of FA is by dual mechanisms that are concentration-dependent as implied in an early finding by Chow and Hollander [16]. They demonstrated that at low linoleate concentrations, FA uptake occurred via a carrier-dependent process, whereas at higher linoleate concentrations, FA uptake was predominantly by passive diffusion. We believe that this dual mechanism is physiologically important to ensure that animals do not lose important essential FA absorption at times when the luminal concentrations are low. In support of a carrier-dependent mechanism, there is an exciting recent article by Hsieh et al. showing that glucagon-like polypeptide 2 increases intestinal CM production through a CD36 mediated pathway [17]. For further information, we recommend an interesting and thoughtful commentary by Newberry and Davidson in the same issue reviewing the role of CD36 and GLP-2 in the uptake of FA and the formation of CMs [18]. We anticipate that we will continue to learn of other FA transporters to

be discovered in addition to the current ones, but we caution that it may be premature to conclude that they play an important role in normal fat absorption when the physiological concentration of FA in the intestinal lumen is usually high.

4. Intracellular metabolism of FA and 2-MG

By what mechanism the absorbed FA and 2-MG travel to the endoplasmic reticulum is not clear. Two FA binding proteins have been identified, the intestinal FA binding protein (I-FABP) and the liver FA binding protein (L-FABP). This subject has been ably reviewed by Storch and Thumser [19]. However, determining the role of the two FABP in the intracellular trafficking of FA has been difficult and there is a lack of convincing *in vivo* studies. One approach would be to knockout the gene of the FABP of interest. This, however, has not yielded definitive results, as the absence of one particular FABP is often compensated by another FABP. Using the I-FABP knockout mouse model, investigators reported that males had higher plasma TGs and greater body weight than wild-type mice, thus implying that fat absorption was probably normal in the genetically modified animals [20]. With the L-FABP knockout, a distinct phenotype was apparent. L-FABP mice were resistant to the obesity associated with the feeding of a western diet [21]. Tyloxapol, an inhibitor of lipoprotein lipase, reduced the accumulation of plasma TG after a bolus dose of intralipid suggesting that there may be less intestinal CM secretion. Whether CM formation and secretion is impaired as well as the precise mechanism for the reduced lipid transport in the L-FABP knockout animals remains unclear and warrants further investigation.

Intracellularly, 2-MG and FA are reconstituted to form TG. 2-MG is reacylated into TG by both acyl-coenzyme A: monoacylglycerol acyltransferase (MGAT) and acyl-coenzyme A: diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) [22,23]. Considerable progress has been made in understanding the various enzymes involved in the metabolism of neutral lipids within the enterocyte, including MGAT and DGAT. This subject has been extensively reviewed in several recent publications [24,25]. There are at least three known MGATs (MGAT1, 2, and 3) and two DGATs (DGAT 1 and 2). DGAT1 knockout animals can sufficiently absorb lipid even when fed a high-fat diet [26]. The only major difference between a DGAT1 knockout animal and a wild-type animal is that the DGAT1 knockout animal exhibits delayed transport of CMs into the circulation. In the same study, the authors have provided evidence that DGAT2 and diacylglycerol transacylase can also participate in the conversion of diacylglycerols into triacylglycerols. DGAT 1 has also been demonstrated to catalyze the synthesis of diacylglycerols, waxes, and retinyl esters [27]. The relative roles of the DGAT1, DGAT2, and diacylglycerol transacylase in the formation of TG under different physiological conditions will be better understood in the near future. There are very active research efforts being carried out on this topic because of the potential therapeutic application of inhibitors and activators in TG metabolism.

The three MGATs are localized in the endoplasmic reticulum and are capable of converting MG into DG; however, their tissue distributions are quite different [25]. MGAT1 mRNA has been detected primarily in the stomach, kidney, and adipose tissue, while MGAT2 and MGAT3 mRNAs have been found predominantly in the small intestine. The MGATs are also unique in that MGAT3 can be found in higher mammals and humans but not in rodents [28] and shares higher sequence homology with DGAT2 than with other MGATs. Thus, it is not surprising that when presented with MG, MGAT3 catalyzes the formation of TG. Although the overall fat absorption in MGAT2 knockout animals is the same relative to the wild-type controls, the MGAT2 knockout animals have significantly delayed intestinal fat absorption [29]. The long delay in lipid transport by the MGAT2 knockout animals may result in the distal intestine being more involved in the absorption and transport of dietary lipids. This may have metabolic consequences as it has been shown by Wu et al. that the distal small intestine is less efficient in packaging and transporting absorbed lipid than the upper intestine [30,31]. It is entirely possible that the metabolism of CMs differs in the proximal and the distal small intestine due to size or composition. Thus, we propose that a reason for multiple MGAT and DGAT enzymes is to ensure that the absorbed lipid is rapidly packaged to form CMs and are transported out of the enterocytes by exocytosis. While the reduction or lack of enzyme activity of one enzyme may not affect the overall absorption of dietary lipids, it may affect the metabolic fate of the dietary lipids as different parts of the small intestine (e.g., ileum) may be involved in absorbing and transporting the lipids involved.

5. Formation of intestinal chylomicrons and very low-density lipoproteins

The enzymes involved in the MG pathway are located on the cytoplasmic surface of the endoplasmic reticulum [32]. The TG is formed at the cytoplasmic surface of the endoplasmic reticulum and that TG enters the cisternae of the endoplasmic reticulum. Because TG has a low solubility in phospholipid bilayers (~3 mol%), it has been postulated that TG molecules saturate the membrane rapidly [33]. Once the solubility of TG has been exceeded, the TG splits the bilayer and forms a small lens. As the lens grows, it bulges into the cytoplasmic side or the cisternal side of the endoplasmic reticulum. Finally, this protrusion pinches off the membrane together with newly synthesized apolipoprotein B48 (apo B48) and forms either lipid droplets in the cytoplasm or precursors of lipoproteins in the cisternae of the endoplasmic reticulum. The formation of apo B containing lipoproteins is a process mediated by microsomal triglyceride transfer

protein [34–36]. This is obviously an important protein for the formation of CMs and mutation of this protein is associated with a number of clinical disorders of CM formation and secretion. This is an active research area not only because of its biological interest but also as a target for drug development to reduce fat absorption.

The enterocytes produce mostly very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) during fasting [37]. Following the ingestion of fat, the enterocytes begin to produce the TG-rich CM particles [38]. Currently, the distinction of intestinal CMs and VLDLs is based on operational criteria. Lipoproteins that have a Svedberg flotation (\(S_f\)) rate exceeding 400 are classified as CMs; those with a \(S_f\) rate of 20–400 are defined as VLDLs [39]. There are numerous reports that support the idea that intestinal CMs and VLDLs are produced by separate pathways. For instance, Ockner et al. documented that the intraduodenal infusion of palmitate causes a marked increase in VLDL transport, but that VLDL output remains unchanged when oleate and linoleate are infused [40]. In contrast, CM output is markedly increased when oleate and linoleate are infused. The FA composition of the VLDL-TG is different from the CM-TG, further supporting different pathways for VLDL and CM assembly. An electron microscopic study conducted by Mahley et al. found that intestinal Golgi vesicles contain either CMs or VLDL particles, and that little mixing of particle sizes [41]. Thus, they concluded that separate biosynthetic pathways for these lipoproteins exist. Also, Vahouny et al. showed that puromycin had no significant effect on the incorporation of radioactive leucine into VLDL peptides in male rats. In contrast, the incorporation of radioactive leucine into CM peptides was markedly inhibited [42].

We have found that rats fed as little as 0.5 mg/h of a hydrophobic surfactant, Pluronic L-81 (L-81), have markedly impaired lymphatic transport of TG and cholesterol [43,44]. L-81 blocked lipid transport by inhibiting the formation of intestinal CMs, but not the formation of VLDL particles. Using this unique tool, we subsequently published that intraduodenal infusion of phosphatidylcholine in rats resulted mostly in the formation and lymphatic transport of VLDLs, and surprisingly L-81 did not affect VLDL synthesis and secretion [45]. However, when triolein was infused, the lymphatic transport of lipid was inhibited because triolein resulted primarily in the formation of CMs [43,44]. We therefore propose two pathways for the formation of intestinal lipoproteins as shown in Fig. 1, one that forms predominantly CMs and one that forms predominantly VLDLs, and it is the pathway for CM formation that is inhibited by L-81 [45]. The pre-CM and pre-VLDL particles are packaged in the Golgi apparatus into either pre-CM or pre-VLDL-containing vesicles. The Golgi-derived vesicles which contain either pre-CMs or pre-VLDLs probably correspond to those vesicles observed by Mahley et al. [41]. Lastly, this hypothesis is further supported by Nutting et al. who measured the appearance time for CMs in control rats and for VLDLs in L-81-treated rats [46]. The appearance time, defined as the

**Fig. 1. Formation of intestinal pre-chylomicron (CM) and pre-very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) particles.** This diagram depicts packaging of the pre-CM and pre-VLDL particle by enterocytes of the small intestine. Absorbed monoglyceride (MG) and fatty acid (FA), major digestion products of triglyceride (TG), are reconstituted in the cell to form TG by the monoglyceride pathway, which is then subsequently packaged into predominantly pre-CM particles. This pathway is inhibited by the presence of L-81. On contrary, absorbed FA and FA derived from hydrolysis of absorbed lysolecithin are used to form TG via the α-glycerophosphate pathway, which is then packaged into pre-VLDL particles. Unlike the formation of pre-CM, this pathway is not sensitive to L-81 [45].

time between placement of radioactive FA into the intestinal lumen and the appearance of radioactive lipid in lymph lipoprotein, was 10.8 min in control rats, which was significantly shorter than the 16.2 min observed in the L-81-treated rats. Thus, although VLDL is smaller and contains less mass than CM, it takes longer to put a VLDL particle together than a CM.

In humans, the liver secretes only apo B-100, and the small intestine secretes only apo B-48 [47,48]. Both apo B-100 and apo B-48 are encoded by the same gene [49,50]. The biogenesis of apo B-48 involves a unique mechanism by which the CAA codon encoding Gln at 2153 of the apo B-100 mRNA is changed to UAA (stop codon) thereby forming apo B-48. Rat apo B-48 has a molecular weight of about 240 kDa and is an extremely hydrophobic protein [51,52]. Each CM or VLDL particle has only one apo B-48 [53]. In a study comparing apobec-1 knockout mice which can only produce apo B-100 and wild-type mice, we found that knockout animals produced fewer TG-rich lipoproteins including CMs under fasting and feeding conditions [54]. It is possible that the reason the gut uses apoB48 as preferred protein to coat CMs while the liver uses apo B-100 for BLDL particle formation is to ensure efficient lipid absorption and CM formation.

### 6. Clinical diseases of chylomicron formation

Abetalipoproteinemia is a rare genetic disorder involving the complete failure of the liver and gut to make TG-rich lipoproteins [55]. It was originally thought that abetalipopenic patients have a problem in synthesizing apo B. Glickman et al. reported that apo B synthesis, as determined

by ³H leucine incorporation, was decreased in abetalipoproteinemic patients but was not abolished suggesting that failure to synthesize apo B by the gut and liver may not be the reason abetalipoproteinemic patients do not produce CMs and VLDL [48]. It was later determined that abetalipoproteinemia results from a mutation of the microsomal TG transfer protein gene [56–58]. The role of microsomal TG transfer protein in the formation of CMs by the small intestine is discussed in the review by Hussain [59].

Anderson’s disease is another disorder involving the formation of CMs by the small intestine [60–62]. Anderson’s disease is also known as CM retention disorder because although observable CM particles are in the enterocytes, there are none in the intercellular space. This suggests that the secretion of CMs is defective among patients who have this disease. In a recent study, Dannoura et al. carefully demonstrated that patients with Anderson’s disease do not have a defect in those genes that encode for any known apoproteins or microsomal TG transfer protein [63]. This suggests that the disease is caused by an unknown factor crucial for the secretion of CMs. Currently, no animal model is available to study this perplexing disorder.

## Summary

The formation and eventual secretion of dietary lipid to the periphery is a multi-stage process that first involves luminal digestion, followed by cellular uptake and processing, and subsequent extracellular transport in the predominant form as CMs. It is important to note that many lipophilic drugs are carried by CMs and VLDL and therefore transported into lymph. Understanding the processes involved in the digestion, uptake, intracellular metabolism and packaging of dietary lipids into CMs is important in drug delivery to the body. We have provided a comprehensive review of this subject matter, and we hope this will act as a stimulus to investigators working on theoretical as well as practical aspects of lipophilic drug delivery to unravel the mechanisms and factors governing the absorption and transport of these compounds by the gastrointestinal tract. The next few years will prove to be exciting and challenging as we, the investigators, attempt to define the mechanism of how the chylomicrons are put together and the factors regulating this complex process.
