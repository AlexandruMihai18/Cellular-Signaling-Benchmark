The aerobactin operon of the virulence plasmid pColV-K30 of *Escherichia coli* K12 consists of four genes for biosynthesis and one for transport of the siderophore. Regulation by iron occurs at the transcriptional level and is mediated by a ferrous iron binding protein designated Fur (*ferric uptake regulation*). The metallated Fur repressor binds at a palindromic dyad, the “iron box” operator, situated in the vicinity of the RNA polymerase attachment site of the promoter. Evidence suggests that the ferrous iron enters the C-terminal domain of Fur to cause a conformational change in the N-terminal part of the protein. This results in greatly enhanced affinity of the repressor for the operator.

Key words: aerobactin, enterobactin, Fur repressor, regulation, siderophores, virulence.

L’opéron aérobactine du plasmide de virulence pColV-K30 d’*Escherichia coli* K12 comprend quatre gènes pour la biosynthèse et un pour le transport du sidérophore. La régulation du fer a lieu au niveau de la transcription et se fait par l’intermédiaire d’une protéine désignée Fur (régulation de la captation du fer) qui lie l’ion ferreux. Le répresseur Fur métallisé se lie à une séquence palindromique en forme de dyade, soit la séquence de l’opérateur fixant la protéine Fur, l’opérateur « iron box », située à proximité du site d’attachement de la RNA polymérase du promoteur. Il semble évident que l’ion ferreux entre dans le domaine C-terminal de Fur causant ainsi un changement de la conformation de la partie N-terminale de la protéine. Cela résulte en une forte augmentation de l’affinité du répresseur pour l’opérateur.

## Introduction

Iron is firmly established as one of the many virulence factors of *Escherichia coli* and of several other microbes pathogenic to man, animals, and possibly, to plants. This follows from the fact that most, if not all, of the pathogens require some level of iron for synthesis of cytochromes, ribonucleotide reductase, and other essential cellular constituents. Furthermore, the tissues of the host constitute a hostile environment from which to glean life-sustaining quantities of this absolutely required mineral element. Most iron of the host is safely sequestered in heme or hemo-proteins, in ferritin, or in hemosiderin. These forms of iron are generally not readily available to the microbial cell. At the same time, living species have erected elaborate defense mechanisms to assure that they do not become “culture media” for bacteria and fungi. For example, transferrin is normally only about one third saturated with respect to iron; the other two thirds undoubtedly plays some kind of anti-septic role in keeping iron away from microbes that could populate and debilitate the host. This tight control of iron at the same time serves to prevent the generation of oxidizing radicals, such as OH·, which have the power to destroy sensitive organic molecules. It is known that certain transition elements, such as iron and copper, act catalytically to generate oxidizing radicals from partially reduced molecular oxygen such as superoxide and hydrogen peroxide.

The several reviews by Weinberg (1984, 1990) should be consulted for a detailed and eloquent exposition of the points just made. Regarding iron and infection, a recent book on the topic is available (Bullen and Griffiths 1987), as are also several excellent reviews (Payne 1988; de Lorenzo and Martinez 1988; Crosa 1989; Griffiths 1991). Our own interest in the subject was piqued by a report by Williams (1979)

that a novel hydroxamate siderophore was present in clinical isolates of *Escherichia coli* bearing the plasmid ColV-K30 (“V” for “virulence”). Up until this time *E. coli* was known to make only enterobactin (enterochelin), a catechol-type siderophore common to many enteric bacteria (Fig. 1). The thermodynamic formation constant of enterobactin for Fe(III) is of the order of \(10^{52}\) (Raymond and Carrano 1979), and there was no reason to suspect that a second siderophore would be useful to the bacteria. Shortly after the paper by Williams (1979), there came findings by Stuart et al. (1980) that iron assimilation is controlled by pColV and by Williams and Warner (1980) that the process is independent of colicin V production. Plasmids of the V type are large and apparently code for many proteins, some of which exhibit bacteriocin activity. Additional functions include serum survival (Binns et al. 1979), replication and incompatibility factors (Perez-Casal and Crosa 1984), and conjugal transfer phenomena (Waters et al. 1989).

### Identification and cloning of the hydroxamate siderophore of pColV-K30

It has been known for several decades that siderophore synthesis is inversely correlated with iron supply. This relationship cuts across many bacterial and fungal species (Garibaldi and Neilands 1956). Growth of *E. coli* (pColV-K30) at low iron resulted in high yields of both enterobactin and the hydroxamate siderophore. Unlike enterobactin, the latter proved to be very soluble in water and insoluble in common organic solvents, such as ether and ethyl acetate, and to carry a strong negative charge. The unknown siderophore was purified by adsorption to and elution from synthetic anion-exchange resin, and it was then characterized

pABN5, which contained, respectively, about 16 kb and 7 kb of insert (Bindereif and Neilands 1983) (Fig. 2). The larger one proved to code for biosynthesis of aerobactin and the receptor for ferric aerobactin, while the smaller one had only the genes for aerobactin biosynthesis. It seemed that the EcoRI site in pABN1 thus occurred in the gene for the outer membrane receptor and that the whole complex was present on a relatively small fragment of DNA.

Several years of research, utilizing mainly the deletion approach, ultimately yielded the correct biosynthetic pathway for aerobactin synthesis and transport in *E. coli* (pColV-K30). A key finding was the detection of no aerobactin but, instead, two new hydroxamates in the culture supernatant of bacteria carrying a derivative of pABN5 with a deletion between the two closely spaced BamHI sites (de Lorenzo et al. 1986). The first of these hydroxamates was neutral and was easily characterized as an α amino acid containing L-N-6-hydroxylysine and acetate conjugated as a hydroxamic acid (Fig. 2). The second, or anionic hydroxamate, was found to consist of citrate linked at one of the distal carboxyl groups of the tricarboxylic acid to the free amino group of the neutral hydroxamate (Fig. 3). This compound should be chiral, but its absolute configuration has not been determined at the moment of writing. The biosynthetic pathway to aerobactin was thus clear (Fig. 3). Minicells charged with pABN5 made only four polypeptides, which on SDS-PAGE analysis, could be seen to have molecular mass values of approximately 33, 50, 62, and 63 kDa.

At this point the order and functions of the gene products were uncertain, and so the four genes were labeled *iucA*, *iucB*, *iucC*, and *iucD*, reading from left to right in pABN5. This retained the nomenclature of Williams (1979), namely, *iuc* = iron uptake chelate. Correlation of complementation activity with aerobactin precursors gave the organization depicted in Fig. 4. The component most difficult to find was the β-polypeptide of aerobactin synthetase (de Lorenzo and Neilands 1986). For an unknown reason it is rather poorly expressed. This is the final enzyme in a sequence in which the order of reactivity is IucD → IucB → IucA → IucC. As shown in Fig. 4, these genes are organized as an operon that includes the single transport gene, *iutA* (iron uptake transport). Quite by accident, this organization resembled closely the speculation made several years previously (Neilands 1973).

Of the five proteins illustrated in Fig. 4, three (the receptor, the acetylase, and the α component of the synthetase) have been isolated in the pure state. Complete gene sequences for *iutA* (Krone et al. 1985) and *iucD* (Herrero et al. 1988) have been published. The oxygenase converting lysine to N-6-hydroxylysine is the novel enzyme of the pathway since it apparently does not occur in animal tissues. Some effort should be expended to isolate this enzyme and to chart its reactive centers, since an antimetabolite directed at this catalyst could have therapeutic value. It is, unfortunately, a membrane-associated enzyme and its isolation in a homogeneous form will not be easy. Probably the easiest way to assay the enzyme would be to provide excess acetylase, which is available (Coy et al. 1986), and to allow one of the products of the acylation reaction, free coenzyme A (CoA), to cleave 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoate). The product, 2-nitro-5-thiobenzoate, has an extinction of 13,600 at 412 nm. An identical assay could be used for N-5-ornithine oxygenase, since the acetylase acts on L-N-5-hydroxyornithine,

by field desorption mass spectrometry and other methods as aerobactin (Warner et al. 1981). Thus the unknown siderophore proved to be identical with a not-so-novel compound isolated several years earlier from culture supernatants of *Aerobacter aerogenes* 62-I (Gibson and Magrath 1969) (Fig. 1).

The next major development was the discovery that a bacteriocin from *Enterobacter cloacae*, cloacin DF13, penetrated the cells of sensitive bacteria by means of the ferric aerobactin receptor (Bindereif et al. 1982; van Tielenkvelt et al. 1982). Parenthetically, it should be noted that other siderophores, such as ferrichrome (Wayne and Neilands 1975) and ferric enterobactin (McIntosh and Earhart 1977), had been shown to share outer membrane receptors with a variety of lethal agents, and so the relationship just described was not entirely unexpected. Apparently the microbe has placed the receptor in the membrane in the hopes of finding a nutritious element, iron. In the course of evolution, antibiotics, bacteriophages, and bacteriocins have adapted themselves to use this port of entry.

At any rate, the cloacin-ferric aerobactin connection provided a convenient basis upon which to devise a selection for a cloned version of the approximately 74-kDa common outer membrane receptor. A cell transformed with the genetic determinants for the cloacin receptor should render the recipient sensitive to cloacin. This double screen (resistance to the drug marker on the vector and sensitivity to the bacteriocin) yielded plasmid pABN1 and its subclone,

The biosynthetic pathway for aerobactin (3) in *E. coli* (pColV-K30) proceeds from L-lysine through its N-6-hydroxy derivative, neutral (1) and chiral anionic (2) hydroxamates, and terminates with the addition of a second residue of (1) to (2) to yield (3).

albeit with an efficiency somewhat less than that seen with the lysine homologue. The ornithine compound is a common constituent of fungal siderophores.

Although hydroxylamines react with acetyl CoA, the rate of acyl transfer is much too slow to be practical, and for this reason an enzyme is required. It contains a number of identical subunits, perhaps as many as six (Coy et al., 1986).

The addition of the neutral hydroxamate to citrate proceeds in two discrete steps through a chiral intermediate. This affords the opportunity for biosynthesis of a number of symmetric and asymmetric siderophores formed by the addition of various hydroxamates to citrate. The latter is itself a weak chelating agent for Fe(III) but is made infinitely more powerful and specific following decoration with the hydroxamic acid containing side chains.

Obviously, some additional work on this gene cluster needs to be performed. The most urgent items would seem to be a search of internal regulatory signals, isolation of the remaining proteins, and determination of the chirality of the intermediate shown in Fig. 3.

#### Regulation of the Aerobactin Operon of pColV-K30

The genes given in Fig. 4 are shown ordered in an operon structure and indeed this has been shown to be the case. Attachment of a promoterless *lacZ* in frame either at the *BamHI* sites of pABN5 or directly to the *iuc* promoter via a linker enabled measurement of the activity of the reporter enzyme as a function of iron concentration (Bindereif and Neilands, 1985a). This localized the action of the metal to the upstream region and confined it to a relatively small segment of DNA. The ratio of activity of fully repressed and fully induced cells was about 30, a value suggesting that iron nutrition alone is the regulatory element. In this study a semiquantitative S1 nuclease protection assay was performed to prove that the iron acts as a transcriptional regulator.

Although iron ions, whether ferrous or ferric, are six coordinate, they lack the “semantic” character required to interact directly with the DNA to modulate transcription. Indeed, Ernst et al. (1978) had previously described mutants of *Salmonella typhimurium* that were constitutive in expression of all high affinity, siderophore-mediated iron absorption systems. Hantke (1981) succeeded in replicating the same mutation, which had become known as *fur* (ferric uptake regulation), in *E. coli*. The gene was shown to code for a 17-kDa protein and a sequence was published (Schaffer et al., 1985). Bagg and Neilands (1985) mapped the same gene at 15.7 min on the *E. coli* chromosome and used a different route for its isolation. A constitutive (*fur*) mutant was obtained by insertion of Tn5, using the *lacZ* insert in *iucC* as indicator. The kanamycin resistance coded on Tn5 was cloned from the mutant and the *fur* gene acquired by homologous recombination from the wild type, the cloned DNA being used to transform the mutant (Bagg and Neilands, 1987a).

The question remained, how does Fur act? The *fur* gene was ligated to an expression system and the product, a

### Text:

**FIG. 4. Organization and regulation of the aerobactin operon of pColV-K30.** The five genes are clustered behind a strong promoter (P). Transcriptional regulation is achieved by activation of a ferrous ion complexing repressor (Fur, ferric uptake regulation) to bind the operator (O). Molecular mass values for the protein products are shown to 0.1 kDa in those instances in which the genes have been sequenced.

A 17-kDa polypeptide was isolated from induced cells by chromatography on zinc iminodiacetate-agarose, using histidine for elution (Wee et al., 1988). As anticipated for a metal-binding protein, as opposed to a metalloprotein, Fur was found nonspecific in regard to the activating metal ion. Any divalent metal across the first row transition series stimulated the protein to bind its operator (Bagg and Neilands, 1987b). Since Mn(II) is rather resistant to oxidation at biological pH, this ion is generally employed as activator *in vitro*. We have implicit faith that the biological activator is Fe(II)! The general mode of action of the Fur repressor is thus obvious. At low internal iron, the repressor, which appears to exist as a dimeric species, has in its metal-free form a relatively low affinity for the operator. As the iron concentration is raised, more ferrous ion, the corepressor, is bound to the Fur protein, thus activating it to attach to the operator. This in turn leads to diminished synthesis of the transcript, and as a result, lower amounts of aerobactin are made. With less aerobactin in the environment, less iron is dissolved and the rate of assimilation of the metal decreases. This is the essence of regulation of high-affinity iron absorption in *E. coli*, although it is conceivable that secondary controls may be operative as well.

In contrast to the simple "on-off" switch that is exerted by iron and the Fur protein, the *fur* gene itself is the subject of a more complicated type of regulation. It has a "fair iron box," which is about 84% homologous with the consensus, and hence it is at least to some degree autoregulated. This requires the presence of a metal ion (de Lorenzo et al., 1988b). However, the gene is also positively regulated by the CAP system. This may account for the fact that, of a number of sugars tested, glucose gave the highest yields of aerobactin (Appanna et al., 1987). High glucose means low cAMP, which means low positive stimulation of the *fur* gene, lower levels of Fur protein, and hence better expression of the aerobactin operon. A role for the CAP-cAMP control may be rather general in the Fur-regulated systems, since it occurs also in the *cir* gene (Griggs et al., 1990), which has long been known to be under iron regulation.

With the pure Fur protein in hand, it was a simple matter to footprint the operator with DNasel and OH· (de Lorenzo et al., 1987, 1988a). This showed that the activated repressor binds a consensus "iron box" sequence 5′GATAATGATA-ATCATTTATC situated somewhere in the vicinity of the RNA polymerase binding site in the promoter. The aerobactin promoter actually contains two such iron box sequences, which are overlapping. The mechanism of action of Fur has not been further elucidated, although it may act by promoter occlusion, i.e., by preventing access by RNA polymerase.

A curious and as yet unexplained feature of all of the *fur* mutants of *E. coli* isolated to date is their pleiotropic nature. The mutants do not thrive as well as the wild type even on complex media and are debilitated with respect to metabolism of small organic acids (Bagg and Neilands, 1987a). Their resistance to Mn(II) has also been altered (Hantke, 1987), although this could be interpreted, in reality, as iron starvation. Thus if Mn(II) substitutes for Fe(II) *in vivo*, which seems to be the case (Bagg and Neilands, 1987b), the cell could imagine itself to be chronically starved for iron. Regulation of superoxide dismutase synthesis is also affected in *fur* mutants (Niederhoffer et al., 1990).

As already mentioned, control of siderophore synthesis by iron is a general phenomenon in bacteria and fungi. It is tempting to speculate that a *fur*-like gene occurs in all of these species, but so far the Fur protein has only been isolated from K12 strains of *E. coli*, and the gene has only been shown to be present in this species and in *Yersinia pestis* (Staggs and Perry, 1991). There is no difficulty in believing that the interior of *E. coli* is highly anaerobic and that sufficient Fe(II) is present, soluble, and available for regulation. Only the oxygenase enzyme of the aerobactin pathway is membrane associated; the rest of the catalysts being in the cytosol. Thus the site of biosynthesis of siderophores in eukaryotes, whether in the cell sap or in the mitochondria, would seem to be of considerable interest. It is difficult to devise a mechanism to keep Fe(II) soluble during the aerobic conditions that must prevail behind the single cytoplasmic membrane of Gram-positive bacteria and fungi.

#### Recent advances

How does Fur, once activated by ferrous ion, function as a repressor? To collect information on this point, Coy and Neilands (1991) used chemical-biochemical methods to generate fragments of the repressor. A study of the isolated components led to the conclusion that the aporepressor is a relatively tightly coiled polypeptide. When the activating metal ion attaches to the protein, which it does at the C-terminal domain, the N-terminal portion is dissociated from the main body of the protein and begins to "hunt" operator DNA. The mode of action of Fur is thus to some extent parallel to that of the CAP-cAMP system (Heyduk and Lee, 1989). This is especially interesting since Fur, although a DNA-binding protein, does not contain the helix-turn-helix motif common to many repressors.

#### Aerobactin and virulence

The correlation between aerobactin synthesis and virulence is especially strong for strains of *E. coli* isolated from extra-

intestinal infections, such as the bloodstream (Montgomerie *et al.* 1984; Linggood *et al.* 1987). However, there is some fragmentary evidence that ability to make the siderophore is important also for strains infecting the large intestine (Smith and Huggins 1976). A number of attempts have been made to construct an antibody against the outer membrane receptor for the siderophore. Although this receptor is accessible to ferric aerobactin and cloacin DF13, only limited success has attended efforts to exploit the receptor as antigen (Roberts *et al.* 1989). Probably this is because the receptor is well hidden in the membrane. Resistance to cloacin does not necessarily indicate the absence of the ferric aerobactin receptor since the latter may be inaccessible to the bacteriocin (Derbyshire *et al.* 1989). In sum, the propensity to synthesize aerobactin does seem to confer some virulence character to *E. coli*, even though the correlation is not perfect.

### Conclusion

The synthesis of aerobactin in *E. coli* may be coded by large plasmids, such as pColV-K30 and pColV-K311 (Braun *et al.* 1987), or by the chromosome (Bindereif and Neilands 1985b; Crosa 1989). In the case of pColV-K30, the route of biosynthesis begins with oxidation of L-lysine, proceeds sequentially through the N-6-hydroxy and N-6-hydroxy-N-6-acetyl derivatives of the amino acid, and ends with the attachment of two of these hydroxamic acid moieties as side chains to the distal carboxyl groups of citrate. The entire process, including the gene for the outer membrane receptor, is regulated by an iron-sensing repressor protein, Fur. The promoter driving the aerobactin operon is “strong” and at low iron no positive activator is required, as seems to be the case in certain species of *Vibrio* (Croса 1989; Goldberg *et al.* 1991).

Although aerobactin is a relatively puny siderophore in terms of its capacity to complex ferric ion, its formation constant of \(10^{23}\) (Raymond and Carrano 1979) is sufficiently large to enable it to pull iron out of ferric transferrin (Konopka *et al.* 1982). The reason for the inability of enterobactin to act as a virulence factor is not completely clear, but it may be related to its aromaticity or to differential removal of iron from the two sites of transferrin by enterobactin and aerobactin (Ford *et al.* 1988).

It should be pointed out that transport of ferric aerobactin requires the participation of a number of additional genetic functions, such as *fhuABCD*, *tonB*, and *exbB*. Most of these functions have not yet been clarified, although *fhuA* is known to code for the outer membrane receptor for ferrichrome (Braun *et al.* 1987). For growth on complex and minimal media, the high-affinity, siderophore-mediated iron-assimilation system can be dispensed with entirely; it is only invoked under conditions of acute iron stress.
