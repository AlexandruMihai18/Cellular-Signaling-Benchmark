The iterative polyketide synthases from the biosynthetic pathways of three enediyne natural products were examined. The results established the all-*trans* conjugated pentadecaheptanene as the only major product shared by the PKSs. The experiments further revealed some intrinsic differences among the PKSs by demonstrating the formation of different by-products.

Enediyne natural products produced by soil and marine microorganisms are potent antitumor agents that can induce cell apoptosis by cleaving chromosomal DNA through an oxidative radical mechanism. The remarkable DNA-cleaving property is attributed to the reactivity of the distinctive 9- or 10-membered enediyne moiety (Fig. 1). Given the unique chemical structure and potent biological activity, the biosynthetic origin of the enediyne moiety had spawned much interest since the discovery of the first enediyne natural product.

In the past several years, sequencing of the biosynthetic gene clusters for several enediyne natural products suggested that the biosynthesis of the 9- and 10-membered enediyne moieties is initiated by an iterative polyketide synthase (PKS). Recently, Shen and coworkers reported that the co-expression of the PKS and thioesterase (TE) from the biosynthetic pathways of the 9-membered enediyne natural products C-1027 and neocarzinostatin produced the conjugated polyene-pentadecaheptanene (4) in *E. coli*. Meanwhile, our group reported that the PKS (CalE8) and TE (CalE7) from the biosynthetic pathway of the 10-membered enediyne natural product calicheamicin produced the carbonyl-conjugated polyene pentadecen-2-one (3). The fifteen carbon-containing 3 and 4 are likely to derive from their respective octaketide intermediates, with the hydrolytic release of the products catalyzed by the TEs SgcE10 and CalE7 (Fig. 2). A mechanism has also been proposed for the formation of 3 through thioester hydrolysis and facile decarboxylation of the transient β-keto acid intermediate 1. In this study, we examined the *in vitro* products generated by the iterative PKSs from the biosynthetic pathways of three enediyne natural products. The results not only suggested that 4 could be the common intermediate in the biosynthesis of 9- and 10-membered enediyne, but also revealed some intrinsic differences among the homologous PKSs.

The 9-membered enediyne natural product C-1027 was isolated from *Streptomyces globisporus* C-1027. The production of 4 by the iterative PKS (SgcE) and TE (SgcE10) in *E. coli* has been reported, with the insoluble polyene 4 deposited in the *E. coli* cell debris after lysis. To examine the *in vitro* products of SgcE, we expressed and purified SgcE and SgcE10 for enzymatic assay. The initial results showed that the enzymes produced a series of products that include 3 (MH⁺, *m/z* = 215.1432), 4 (MH⁺, *m/z* = 199.1478) and several other products. However, in contrast to the large quantity of 4 produced by SgcE in *E. coli*, only a small amount of 4 was initially observed when trifluoric acid (TFA) was used to quench the reaction prior to product extraction. A significant amount of 4 could be observed only when HCl was used for precipitating the protein (Fig. 3B). The discrepancy in the yield of 4 is likely due to the chemical instability of the conjugated polyene 4 in the presence of TFA. Exploration of the assay conditions revealed that 4 becomes the single dominant product under the mild assay conditions (pH 7.0, 23 °C, 0.25 mM malonyl CoA and 0.25 mM NADPH) that a moderate catalytic rate was maintained (Fig. 3A). The yield of the by-products increased with pH, temperature and malonyl CoA concentration (Fig. 3B, Fig. S1–3†). In addition to 4 and 3, several other products, including a few putative polyene of various lengths and a major by-product (5) (*m/z* = 241.1202 (MH⁺)) with unknown structure, were also observed. Interestingly, only a small amount of the carbonyl-conjugated polyene (3) was produced under all assay conditions.

4 must have been underestimated. Indeed, we could observe both 3 and 4, along with three previously observed pyrone derivatives 6, 7 and 8, [15] when HCl was used to quench the CalE8/E7 reaction (Fig. 3C and D, Fig. S7†). A very recent study from Townsend and coworkers also demonstrated the generation of 3 and 4 by CalE8, with the postulated intermediate 1 confirmed by mass spectrometry. [17] Our enzymatic assays further revealed that the product ratio varies considerably with substrate concentration and assay conditions. Although 3 was produced as a major product at a high catalytic rate at elevated pH, temperature and malonyl CoA concentration (Fig. 3D and Fig. S3–6†), 4 became the single dominant product when the enzymatic reaction was carried out at a moderate rate with sufficient NADPH (Fig. 3C). The variation of the 3:4 ratio strongly suggests that the last keto-reduction step catalyzed by the KR domain is sensitive to environmental changes and catalytic rate, which is further supported by the [NADPH] dependent experiment (Fig. 3I). The observation of 3 as a major product for CalE8 under certain conditions, but not for SgcE, indicates some intrinsic differences between the two PKSs.

Dynemicin isolated from *Micromonospora chersina* is one of the first enediyne natural products with its structure determined. [10,18] Although both dynemicin and calicheamicin/esperamicin contain a 10-membered enediyne moiety, [13C]-isotope feeding experiments suggested that the acetate units were incorporated into different positions in the enediyne moiety [2,3] (Fig. 1B). The discrepancy in isotope incorporation pattern indicated that the biosynthesis of dynemicin may involve a different precursor or different folding pattern. The iterative PKS (DynE8) and TE (DynE7) from the dynemicin biosynthetic pathway have not been characterized previously. Our enzymatic assay with the purified proteins showed that DynE8 generated 4 as the dominant product at a moderate catalytic rate (Fig. 3E). DynE8 also produced a series of minor products that include 3 and 5 at elevated pH and temperature (Fig. 3F). However, unlike CalE8, 3 was never observed as a major product for DynE8. Hence, it seems there are some subtle differences between CalE8 and DynE8 as well. Meanwhile, the production of 4 indicates that CalE7 and DynE7 are fully capable of catalyzing the putative decarboxylation and dehydration of the intermediate 2 (Fig. 2).

Although the structures of 3 and 4 have been determined by NMR and MS, [13,14] the absolute configuration of the double bonds was not established due to the overlap of the resonance signals in the ethylenic proton region. We speculated that the products of CalE8 may contain a *cis* double bond based on the kinked substrate-binding channel in the crystal structure of CalE7. [15] To validate the presence, or absence, of the *cis* double bond, we have synthesized the all-*trans* (3E,5E,7E,9E,11E,13E)-pentadecen-2-one as a standard. HPLC analysis revealed that the standard shares identical retention time and absorption spectrum with 3 (Fig. 3H), suggesting that the products of CalE8 are likely to contain *E*-configured double bonds. The kinked channel in apo-CalE7 and the confirmation of the all-*trans* product suggest that CalE7 must undergo significant distortion or conformational change during substrate binding.

In conclusion, the enzymatic assays unequivocally established the conjugated polyene 4 as the major *in vitro* product for the three iterative PKSs from enediyne biosynthetic pathways. Townsend and coworkers recently proposed that neither 3 nor 4 is the biosynthetic intermediate based on the observation that CalE8 produced multiple products under *in vitro* conditions.¹⁷ The observation that 4 becomes nearly the sole product at moderate catalytic rate with physiologically relevant substrate concentrations, however, seems to suggest that 4 could be biologically relevant. Nonetheless, considering that iterative PKSs may or may not need the assistance of ancillary proteins to generate correct products,¹⁹⁻²¹ the final establishment of 4, 3, or another product as the biosynthetic intermediate still awaits the demonstration of the processing of the putative intermediate. The comparison of the three PKSs revealed that CalE8 is the only PKS that produces 3 as a major product under the conditions that maintain a high catalytic rate. This strongly suggests that CalE8 has a higher propensity to skip the final reduction step compared to the other two PKSs. Whether the intrinsic differences among the PKSs can be amplified for producing different biosynthetic intermediates with the assistance of accessory proteins remains an intriguing possibility.
