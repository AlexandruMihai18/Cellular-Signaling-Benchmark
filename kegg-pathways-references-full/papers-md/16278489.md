Drug addiction is a chronic disease characterized by compulsive drug use despite the severe negative consequences associated with it. Repeated exposure to drugs of abuse results in molecular adaptations in neuronal signaling pathways, which eventually manifest in the complex behavioral alterations that characterize addiction. These include tolerance, sensitization, dependence, drug craving, and relapse. In this Review, we focus on recent studies highlighting signaling cascades initiated by cocaine, as a representative of a drug of abuse with a defined site of action, and alcohol, as a drug with an undefined primary site of action. Specifically, we describe recent studies that emphasize the role of protein-protein interactions, phosphorylation, and compartmentalization in the molecular mechanisms that result in the cellular and behavioral adaptations that underlie addiction. Signaling cascades that contribute to addiction, as well as those that protect or delay the development of addiction, are presented.

### Introduction

Drug addiction is a chronic and devastating disease. According to the Office of National Drug Control Policy, almost 14 million people in the United States abuse alcohol, costing society about $180 billion a year and untold social problems. There are 3 million chronic cocaine users and 1 million chronic opiate abusers in the United States, and addiction to psychostimulants such as methamphetamine is rapidly on the rise. Furthermore, nicotine addiction is one of the most common and costly addictions worldwide.

Addiction is defined as repetitive and compulsive drug use, in spite of severe negative consequences. The development of addiction depends on a complex interplay of social, biological, and genetic factors (1, 2). Although methadone has been successfully used to treat heroin (opiate) addiction, and medications for nicotine withdrawal (smoking cessation) are being actively developed, very few medications are available to treat alcoholism, and the few treatments that are currently approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are not widely effective (3). Furthermore, no FDA-approved medications are currently available to treat addiction to cocaine and other psychostimulants. Therefore, there is a clear need to understand the neurobiology of drug addiction at the cellular and molecular levels, in order to develop new and effective pharmacotherapies for this disease.

The mesolimbic dopamine system is a major site of action for all drugs of abuse, including alcohol. It consists of dopaminergic neurons from the ventral tegmental area (VTA), which project to forebrain regions such as the nucleus accumbens (Nac), prefrontal cortex (PFC), amygdala, and hippocampus (4). Drugs of abuse, including alcohol, increase the concentration of dopamine in limbic regions, particularly in the Nac (5), a region that is thought to be important in the learned anticipation of reward (6, 7). Mechanistically, addiction is thought to depend on molecular and cellular adaptations that lead to persistent changes in transcription, translation, and synaptic morphology that are extremely long-lived and are analogous to the plastic processes that underlie learning and memory (4). These molecular adaptations lead to, or manifest in, the functional alterations that characterize addiction: tolerance, dependence, withdrawal, craving, and relapse (8). Once addiction is established, it can be a life-long chronic disease, with episodes of intense drug craving that result in recurring relapses (8). Even after prolonged periods of withdrawal, 90% of illicit drug users and alcoholics relapse (9), emphasizing the sustained drive for drug-taking. Triggers of craving include the drug itself, drug paraphernalia, environmental cues associated with drug-taking, stress, or some combination of these factors (10).

Long-lasting changes in the brain reward system following chronic drug exposure are thought to underlie addiction. Indeed, molecular adaptations to acute and prolonged exposure to, and withdrawal from, drugs of abuse have been well documented; however, the signaling pathways underlying these adaptations and their physiological consequences are only now starting to be understood. In this review, we focus on signaling pathways initiated by cocaine, as a representative of a drug of abuse with a defined site of action, and alcohol, as a drug of abuse with an undefined primary site of action.

Cocaine and ethanol: Sites of action. Most drugs of abuse have well-defined pharmacological targets. For example, nicotine binds to and activates nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, and opiates such as morphine and heroin interact with the μ subtype of opioid receptors (11). Cocaine primarily acts by inhibiting the dopamine transporter and thus blocking the reuptake of dopamine into presynaptic terminals, which results in an increase in extracellular dopamine concentration. Cocaine can also increase the extracellular concentrations of serotonin and norepinephrine by blocking the transporters for these monoamines (12). However, most of cocaine’s rewarding properties stem from its action as a dopamine transporter inhibitor, and the subsequent activation of dopamine-binding heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein)-coupled receptors (GPCRs) (13). Dopamine binds to two classes of GPCRs: the D1-type receptors (which include D1 and D5 receptors) and the D2-type receptors (D2, D3, and D4) (14). Dopamine receptors enhance (D1-type) or inhibit (D2-type) the activity of adenylate cyclase, through coupling to stimulatory ($\mathrm{G}_{\alpha_{s}}$) or inhibitory

(Gα<sub>i</sub>) G proteins, respectively. D1-type receptor activation results in an increase in adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate (cAMP) concentration and the consequent activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) signaling pathways, whereas D2-type receptor activation results in a reduction in PKA activation (Fig. 1A).

Alcohol (ethanol), on the other hand, is a small, polar, highly membrane-permeable agent that does not have a defined site of action. Ethanol affects multiple targets, altering various neuro-modulatory and neurotransmitter systems [including those using glutamate, γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and adenosine] and activating the dopaminergic reward pathway. The ability of ethanol to mediate such diverse cellular effects led originally to the proposal of a nonspecific membrane perturbation hypothesis for its actions. However, current concepts suggest that ethanol acts on specific proteins (15). Because ethanol does not have a defined pharmacological site of action, it is unlikely that these interactions involve binding in a classical pharmacological sense to specific ligand site(s). It has, however, been suggested that ethanol may occupy cavities, or pockets, within specific membrane proteins (16–19). For example, certain neurotransmitter receptors, such as N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) and GABA type A receptors (GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs), and ion channels, such as voltage-gated potassium and calcium channels, are particularly sensitive to inhibition or enhancement of channel function by acute ethanol treatment (20–24).

Although drugs of abuse act on different receptor systems, they activate common downstream sequences of events, which underlie characteristic behavioral phenotypes such as compulsive drug-taking, craving, and relapse, and these behaviors can be modeled in rodents (see Appendix, Common Behavioral Paradigms in Addiction Research). Here, we describe recent studies that emphasize the role of protein-protein interactions, phosphorylation, and compartmentalization in intracellular signaling cascades that underlie cocaine and ethanol-induced behavioral responses. In addition, we highlight several studies that suggest that exposure to drugs of abuse not only initiates signaling cascades that lead to adverse behavioral phenotypes associated with addiction, but also results in the activation of homeostatic pathways that may protect against, and thus delay, the development of addiction.

## Accessory Proteins Regulating G Protein-Coupled Receptors

Chronic cocaine-induced neuronal adaptations in dopaminergic and glutamatergic signaling are thought to be mediated, at least in part, through compromised Gα<sub>i</sub>-coupled receptor signaling. Specifically, alterations in signaling through Gα<sub>i</sub>-coupled dopamine D2-type receptors and group II metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR2 and 3) may contribute to the long-lasting adaptations that underlie drug addiction (25–28). Recent studies have implicated two families of G protein regulators in contributing to adaptations in signaling through these Gα<sub>i</sub>-mediated receptors and in playing important roles in cocaine-induced behaviors such as sensitization, drug-seeking, and relapse.

### AGS3 and RGS9

The activator of G protein signaling (AGS) family consists of three functionally distinct members (29). AGS3 is enriched in neurons (29) and is the only member that has currently been associated with drug-induced changes (as described below). AGS3 regulates G protein activity by binding to and stabilizing the inactive guanosine diphosphate

![Figure 1](#fig1)

**Fig. 1.** G protein accessory proteins and adaptations to prolonged cocaine exposure. (A) Under physiological conditions, adenylate cyclase (AC) and the cAMP-PKA pathway are activated by stimulation of dopamine D1 receptors and other Gα<sub>s</sub>-coupled receptors, and inhibited through the Gα<sub>i</sub>-coupled dopamine D2 and glutamate mGluR2 and mGluR3 receptors. (B) Repeated cocaine exposure or withdrawal results in increased abundance of the G protein regulators RGS9-2 and AGS3 in distinct brain regions (Nac, nucleus accumbens; DS, dorsal striatum; PFC, prefrontal cortex). Both proteins reduce Gα<sub>i</sub>-mediated signaling, which leads to an overall increase in the cAMP-PKA pathway, which contributes to the expression of several behaviors (see Appendix). CPP, conditioned place preference.

gant study implicated AGS3 in the decreased activity of Gα<sub>i</sub>-coupled D2-type receptors and mGluR2 and 3 receptors that takes place after prolonged exposure of rats to cocaine (31). Repeated injection of cocaine or self-administration of the drug resulted in an up-regulation of AGS3 immunoreactivity in the PFC and the Nac core, which was long-lasting and could be detected at least 8 weeks after withdrawal from chronic cocaine administration (31). To determine the functional consequences of the sustained increase in AGS3 levels, the authors used a peptide containing the Gα<sub>i</sub>-binding domain of AGS3. This peptide prevents Gα<sub>i</sub> from binding to guanosine triphosphate (GTP) and, thus, mimics the function of full-length AGS3. Microinjection of the peptide [fused to a Tat sequence to enable its transduction through membranes (32)] into the PFC led to higher extracellular glutamate concentrations in the Nac core and enhanced cocaine reinstatement (Appendix) (31). Conversely, infusing AGS3 antisense oligonucleotides into the PFC reversed the reduction in D2-type and mGluR2 and 3 receptor signaling observed in rats after withdrawal from repeated cocaine exposure (31). Moreover, the AGS3 antisense infusion inhibited the expression of cocaine-induced behavioral sensitization and prevented the reinstatement of cocaine-seeking behavior (31).

Regulators of G protein signaling (RGS), a large family of proteins that act by accelerating the conversion of the active, GTP-bound Gα protein to the inactive, GDP-bound conformation, also negatively regulate GPCRs (33). One member of this family, RGS9-2, shows a largely striatal-specific expression pattern in rat brain (34, 35). RGS9-2 is found in a large fraction of dopamine D2 receptor-containing medium spiny neurons in the Nac (36), and it colocalizes with dopamine D2 receptors when coexpressed in mammalian cells (37). Repeated daily cocaine injections or chronic cocaine self-administration increases the abundance of RGS9-2 in the dorsal striatum and Nac (36). Viral-mediated overexpression of RGS9-2 specifically in the Nac inhibited D2-type receptor-mediated activity and reduced sensitivity to cocaine-induced hyperlocomotion (36). Conversely, RGS9 null mice show enhanced locomotor activity and both greater sensitization and greater preference for the place in which they were exposed to cocaine (conditioned place preference) compared with their wild-type littermates (36). Together, these results suggest that up-regulation of AGS3 and RGS9-2, as well as the consequent inhibition of the Gα<sub>i</sub>-coupled D2-type and mGluR2 and 3 receptors, shifts the signaling balance toward Gα<sub>s</sub>-coupled receptors, which leads to enhanced activation of the cAMP-PKA pathway (Fig. 1). Thus, dysregulation of PFC-Nac neurocircuitry after repeated cocaine exposure, mediated through changes in the levels of AGS3 and RGS9-2, may underlie a mechanism of tolerance and thereby contribute to increased drug-taking. Alternatively, these may represent compensatory mechanisms that inhibit drug-seeking behavior.

### Phosphorylation

Phosphorylation is a central mechanism for altering the activity, subcellular localization, interaction, and stability of proteins. As such, substrate phosphorylation regulates normal cell function and is altered in various disease states, including addiction. In the following sections, we discuss examples of pathways implicated in cocaine- or ethanol-mediated behaviors that involve modulation of the function of serine-threonine kinases [PKA, PKC (protein kinase C), and cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5)] and tyrosine kinases (Fyn and Src). In addition, we discuss a

protein (DARPP-32) that is an important regulator of drug-induced phosphorylation and dephosphorylation events, in a manner that is determined by its own phosphorylation state.

PKA. The cAMP-PKA pathway is a primary signaling cascade that is activated after exposure to both cocaine and alcohol. Activation of adenylate cyclase, through Gα<sub>s</sub>-coupled receptors, leads to the accumulation of cAMP and the subsequent activation of PKA, which results in the dissociation of the catalytic subunit of PKA (Ca) from its regulatory (R) subunits and the phosphorylation of nearby substrates (38, 39). Ca can also translocate to the nucleus, where it phosphorylates the transcription factor cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), which results in the increased transcription of genes containing a cAMP response element (CRE) in their promoter regions (Fig. 2) (40). All drugs of abuse, including opiates, alter the cAMP-PKA signaling pathway. For a recent detailed review on the role of the cAMP pathway in opiate addiction, see (41).

Cocaine activates the PKA signaling pathway mainly through activation of D1-type receptors (Fig. 2), and this pathway plays a critical role in mediating the behavioral responses to cocaine administration. Administration of D1 receptor agonists or antagonists alters behaviors associated with cocaine (42), and D1 receptor-null mice do not exhibit cocaine-mediated induction of locomotor activity (43). Further, direct activation of PKA in the Nac decreases the rewarding properties of cocaine, whereas PKA inhibition has the opposite effect (44).

Because activation of the cAMP-PKA pathway leads to an increase in the activity of the transcription factor CREB, the possible role of CREB as a downstream mediator of adaptations to cocaine exposure has been investigated. In a study (45) in which viral delivery was used to overexpress wild-type or a dominant-negative form of CREB in the Nac and the rewarding properties of cocaine were tested with the conditioned place-preference paradigm (Appendix), wild-type CREB reduced the rewarding properties of cocaine, whereas dominant-negative CREB enhanced it (45). These results suggest that activation of CREB could reduce the sensitivity to cocaine. Support for this possibility stems from two studies that used transgenic mice that overexpress different forms of CREB. First, transgenic mice that overexpress a mutant form of CREB with reduced transcriptional activity showed enhanced responses to cocaine in a conditioned place-preference paradigm, which suggested that the drug was more rewarding. The same mice also exhibited increased cocaine-induced locomotor activity compared with wild-type mice (46). Conversely, transgenic mice overexpressing wild-type CREB showed decreased sensitivity to the rewarding properties of cocaine (47).

One of the genes downstream of CREB in the Nac encodes preprodynorphin (45), the precursor gene product of dynorphin, the endogenous opioid peptide that activates the κ-opioid receptor (KOR). Dynorphin is up-regulated in the striatum following cocaine exposure (Fig. 2) (48), and microinjection of a KOR-specific antagonist into the Nac of mice overexpressing wild-type CREB attenuated the CREB-mediated reduction in the rewarding properties of cocaine (45). These results are consistent with other studies, which found that KOR agonists inhibit the development of cocaine-induced sensitization and reward, as well as decrease cocaine-induced dopamine release (49). Thus, the KOR-dynorphin system may negatively regulate drug reward. However, CREB-mediated positive or negative effects are specific to particular brain subregions. For example, viral infec-

Fig. 2. Modulation of kinases and phosphatases by cocaine and ethanol. Cocaine and ethanol activate the cAMP-PKA pathway through direct (cocaine) or indirect (ethanol) activation of the D1 receptor. cAMP promotes the dissociation of the regulatory subunit (R) of PKA from the catalytic subunit (PKA-Cα), which leads to PKA activation. PKA-Cα phosphorylates substrates such as the NR1 subunit of the NMDAR, which enhances channel activity. PKA-Cα also phosphorylates DARPP-32 at Thr³⁴, which leads to the inhibition of the phosphatase PP1, which in turn stabilizes the phosphorylation of the NR1 subunit and enhances ERK activation. Finally, PKA-Cα translocates to the nucleus, where it phosphorylates the transcription factor CREB, which leads to CRE-mediated gene expression. This results in increases in the transcription of genes such as the GluR1 subunit of the AMPA receptor (cocaine), CRF, NPY (ethanol), and dynorphin and BDNF (cocaine and ethanol) in specific brain regions. These changes in gene expression contribute to the behaviors listed. The GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor is an additional membrane target of ethanol. PKC isoforms can differentially phosphorylate the receptor, which leads to alterations in behavioral responses to ethanol.

tion of rostral VTA neurons with wild-type CREB increases the rewarding effects of cocaine, whereas overexpression of wild-type CREB in the caudal VTA results in cocaine aversion (50). Conversely, viral delivery of the dominant-negative CREB mutant into the rostral VTA decreases the rewarding actions of cocaine, whereas infection in the caudal VTA causes cocaine and morphine to be more rewarding (50). Overexpression of wild-type CREB in the VTA also results in increased abundance of

the GluR1 subunit of the ionotropic glutamate α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor, and increased abundance of GluR1 in the VTA plays an important role in cocaine-induced sensitization (Fig. 2) (51). The brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is another CREB-regulated gene that has been found to play a role in cocaine's actions (52, 53). For example, infusion of BDNF into the VTA prevents biochemical adaptation to chronic cocaine exposure (54) and increases cocaine-mediated locomotor activity and sensitization (55). In addition, BDNF heterozygote mice show a reduction in conditioned place preference for cocaine (56). Thus, enhanced D1-type receptor signaling, leading to the activation of the cAMP-PKA pathway and subsequent CREB-mediated gene expression, facilitates further reinforcement of drug-taking, but also results in compensatory mechanisms (such as increased dynorphin expression) that inhibit drug-seeking by reducing drug reward.

Chronic cocaine administration, by way of D1-type receptor activation, also mediates the transcriptional induction of another transcription factor, ΔFosB, in the Nac, dorsal striatum, and VTA (57, 58). ΔFosB is a member of the Fos family of transcription factors, which dimerize with the Jun family of transcription factors to stimulate the transcription of genes that contain activator protein–1 (AP-1) sites within their promoter regions (Fig. 3) (59). After repeated administration of drugs of abuse, such as cocaine, ΔFosB abundance steadily increases; this increase persists long after cessation of drug treatment (60–63). The sustained increase in ΔFosB abundance in the Nac and dorsal striatum is thought to contribute to stable changes in gene expression that occur after chronic drug intake. Support for this possibility stems from studies showing that transgenic mice that overexpress ΔFosB in the striatum show greater sensitivity to behaviors associated with cocaine. ΔFosB-overexpressing mice exhibit increased locomotor activity after a single cocaine injection, more cocaine self-administration, greater cocaine-induced sensitization, and greater sensitivity to cocaine reward as measured by the conditioned place-preference paradigm, compared with wild-type mice (47, 64, 65). Several genes are transcriptionally upregulated by chronic cocaine exposure in a mechanism that depends on ΔFosB. For example, repeated administration of cocaine increased the abundance of another transcription factor, nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) in the Nac, an increase that was nine times that in the ΔFosB-overexpressing mice than in wild-type mice (Fig. 3) (66). Expression of the GluR2 subunit of the AMPA receptor (64) and Cdk5 (67, 68) (discussed below) are also transcriptionally induced in a ΔFosB-dependent manner (Fig. 3). Finally, mice overexpressing a dominant-negative form of c-Jun, which acts as an inhibitor of Fos-Jun–mediated transcription, do not exhibit chronic cocaine-mediated increases in NF-κB, GluR2, and Cdk5 (69). Thus, ΔFosB may contribute to cocaine addiction by altering the expression of numerous genes involved in important signaling pathways.

Detailed molecular studies in cultured cell lines have highlighted the PKA signaling pathway as being particularly sensitive to ethanol (70), and the expression of a substantial proportion of ethanol-responsive genes is regulated by PKA (71). Adding weight to these in vitro studies are a large number of animal studies, in both invertebrates and mammals, implicating the PKA pathway in behavioral responses to ethanol. An elegant study demonstrated that loss of function of three independent proteins in the PKA pathway resulted in flies with increased

**Fig. 3. Adaptations to long-term cocaine exposure through the activation of ΔFosB-mediated transcription.** Long-term cocaine administration results in a gradual increase in the abundance of the transcription factor ΔFosB. ΔFosB, when it is dimerized with the transcription factor Jun, activates AP-1–mediated gene expression, which leads to an increase in the transcription of the genes encoding Cdk5, NF-κB, and the GluR2 subunit of the AMPA receptor. Increased abundance of Cdk5, its activator p35, or both results in an increase in kinase activity. Cdk5 phosphorylates the regulatory protein DARPP-32 at Thr<sup>75</sup>, and phospho-Thr<sup>75</sup>–DARPP-32 inhibits PKA. This pathway may attenuate the increase in PKA abundance after prolonged cocaine exposure. Cdk5 can also phosphorylate PSD-95; behaviorally, the kinase acts to inhibit behavioral sensitization to cocaine.

acute sensitivity to ethanol, as assayed in a paradigm measuring the duration of loss of posture (72). Studies in mice are largely in agreement with these findings, showing that an impaired ability to activate the cAMP-PKA pathway leads to increased ethanol sensitivity. For instance, mice with reduced neuronal PKA activity (resulting from transgenic expression of a dominant inhibitor isoform of the R subunit of PKA within the forebrain), or reduced levels of Gα<sub>s</sub> (through heterozygous inactivation of the gene encoding Gα<sub>s</sub>), show increased sensitivity to ethanol-induced sedation and decreased ethanol consumption. These tendencies were measured, respectively, by the loss-of-righting reflex (LORR) assay and the two bottle-choice paradigm (Appendix) (73). Complementary to these findings, mice with increased adenylate cyclase activity (resulting from the transgenic expression of a constitutively active form of Gα<sub>s</sub> within the forebrain) are less sensitive to the sedative-hypnotic

effects of ethanol, as demonstrated by more rapid recovery in the LORR assay (73). Moreover, mice deficient in neuropeptide Y (NPY), the NPY₁ receptor, or the serotonin [5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)] 5-HT₁B receptor, display reduced sensitivity to the sedative-hypnotic effects of ethanol and consume more ethanol in a two bottle-choice test (74–76). NPY-overexpressing mice, on the other hand, display the opposite phenotype (75). NPY₁ and 5-HT₁B receptors couple to Gαi, hence loss of receptor function results in activation of the cAMP-PKA pathway. Finally, viral delivery into the Nac of a peptide that inhibits the βγ subunits of G proteins, and thereby attenuates activation of the cAMP-PKA pathway, reduces ethanol self-administration in rats (77). Thus, molecules along the entire pathway leading to the activation of PKA have been implicated in determining acute behavioral responses to ethanol.

One mechanism through which PKA signaling can alter the sensitivity to ethanol is by regulating the function of membrane proteins that are sensitive to ethanol. Type 1 equilibrative nucleoside transporter (ENT-1) is responsible for ethanol inhibition of adenosine reuptake and leads to increased extracellular adenosine concentration, which can activate the cAMP-PKA pathway through the Gαs-coupled adenosine A₂ receptor (70). Reduced PKA activation after chronic ethanol exposure may lead to decreased phosphorylation of the ENT-1 transporter (or one of its associated regulatory proteins), potentially making it insensitive to further ethanol inhibition (70).

Another membrane target of ethanol is the NMDAR. NMDAR function in several brain regions is inhibited by acute ethanol (24). Prolonged ethanol exposure in cultured hippocampal neurons leads to a compensatory increase in the abundance of synaptic NMDARs, which can be prevented by the addition of a PKA inhibitor (78). This up-regulation of NMDARs is likely to have pathophysiological consequences, such as contributing to the hyperexcitability that occurs within neural circuitry when chronic ethanol administration is withdrawn. Furthermore, a single dose of ethanol can produce long-lasting enhancement (lasting more than 7 days) of GABA-mediated synaptic function in the VTA, through a PKA-dependent pathway, and this enhancement appears to facilitate or maintain ethanol consumption in rats (79).

As with cocaine, CREB is a downstream target that is phosphorylated and activated by PKA in the presence of ethanol (Fig. 2) (80–82), and CREB’s function as a transcription factor may account for many of the long-term adaptive responses to ethanol (4). Alterations in the abundance of phosphorylated CREB (phospho-CREB) within distinct brain regions have been associated with ethanol preference, reward, and dependence in various rodent models (83). For example, rats selectively bred for their high levels of ethanol consumption (alcohol-prefering, or P rats) (84) exhibit less phospho-CREB in the amygdala than a nonpreferring (NP) rat strain (85). A series of elegant experiments has recently demonstrated that ethanol intake and phospho-CREB abundance in these rats are not merely associated, but are causally related (86). Infusion of PKA activators into the central nucleus of the amygdala of P rats led to an increase in PKA-Coα and phospho-CREB abundance and decreased ethanol intake (86). In the converse experiment, infusion of PKA inhibitors into NP rats led to a decrease in PKA and CREB function and an increase in ethanol consumption—thus converting nonpreferring rats to alcohol-prefering (86). Furthermore, mice that are deficient in two major CREB isoforms (α and δ)

have decreased abundance of CREB, phospho-CREB, and NPY (a downstream target gene of CREB) in various brain regions, have a higher preference for ethanol and consume more ethanol in the two bottle-choice test than do wild-type mice (Fig. 2) (87). These findings therefore suggest that chronic down-regulation of the cAMP-PKA pathway may be linked to behaviors associated with excessive drinking.

In addition to NPY, other CREB target genes, such as corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), dynorphin, and BDNF, have been associated with alterations in ethanol-related responses. CRF is a 41-amino acid peptide that is highly distributed throughout the brain (88). The abundance of CRF is lower in the central nucleus of the amygdala of P rats than in that of NP rats (89, 90), and CRF-deficient mice consume twice as much ethanol as do wild-type mice in a two bottle-choice paradigm (Fig. 2) (91). Furthermore, these mice fail to demonstrate a conditioned place preference for ethanol, which suggests that a CRF deficiency may lead to excessive ethanol consumption by reducing the rewarding effects of ethanol (91). Lower basal abundance of dynorphin in the Nac has also been observed in P rats compared with NP rats (92) and in the ethanol-preferring C57BL/6J mouse line compared with the low-preferring DBA/2J mouse strain (93, 94). Activation of KOR can attenuate voluntary ethanol intake in rats (95), which suggests that the dynorphin-KOR system modulates ethanol drinking behaviors. Lower levels of BDNF have also been associated with increased sensitivity to ethanol, because BDNF heterozygous mice show increased ethanol intake and behavioral sensitization, as well as increased place preference for ethanol, compared with wild-type mice (Fig. 2) (96, 97). Furthermore, the gene for BDNF has been linked with alcohol abuse in human subjects (98). Thus, the PKA pathway may regulate ethanol consumption and reward through several CREB-target genes.

In summary, various studies have found that activation of the cAMP-PKA pathway is centrally involved in determining acute ethanol responsiveness, whereas chronic ethanol exposure leads to an adaptive down-regulation of this pathway. Interestingly, opposite adaptive responses have been observed for other drugs of abuse, such as cocaine (discussed above). Whether this down-regulation takes place throughout the brain in the alcohol-addicted state, or whether it is brain-region-specific, remains to be determined.

PKC. Protein kinase C (PKC) includes a family of serine/threonine kinases that are activated through calcium, lipid second messengers, or both (99). At least eight different PKC isozyms have been identified in the CNS (100, 101). Activated PKC isozyms translocate to their substrate sites, where they bind to isozyme-specific anchoring or scaffolding proteins (102). Ethanol has been shown to both activate and inhibit PKC activity in vitro (103). For example, acute ethanol exposure in cultured cells prevents the activation-induced translocation of the PKCβII isozyme to its substrates and thus inhibits the activity of this PKC isozyme (104). However, the specific PKC isozyms and the underlying pathways involved in mediating ethanol responses in vivo are just beginning to be unraveled.

Genetically engineered mice have revealed important roles for two specific PKC isozyms, PKCy and PKCe, in ethanol-induced behavioral responses. PKCy knockout mice show a reduced sensitivity to the hypnotic effects of ethanol (105) and display increased ethanol preference as assayed in a two bottle-choice paradigm (106). PKCe knockout mice show de-

creased sensitivity to the sedative and hypnotic effects of ethanol (101). However, in contrast to PKCγ mice, the PKCε knockout mice show a reduction in ethanol preference and consume less ethanol in the two bottle-choice and operant self-administration paradigms, compared with wild-type mice (107, 108). The activity of GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs is less sensitive to modulation by ethanol in biochemical studies of cerebellar and cortical tissue prepared from PKCγ knockout mice, compared with their wild-type littermates (105), whereas similar studies in the PKCε knockout mice have shown an increased enhancement of GABA<sub>A</sub>R function by ethanol, compared with wild-type littermates (107). PKCγ physically interacts with GABA<sub>A</sub>R subunits in rat cortical preparations, and chronic ethanol treatment alters these associations (109). Although a direct association between PKCε and GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs has yet to be demonstrated, it is clear that GABA<sub>A</sub>R function is differentially modulated by PKCγ and PKCε. Furthermore, the actions of these two PKC isoforms may be antagonistic to each other, with respect to both GABA<sub>A</sub>R sensitivity and behavioral sensitivity to ethanol (Fig. 2).

Other downstream targets of PKC are also likely to be involved in determining the behavioral responses to ethanol. For example, inhibition of PKCε prevents ethanol-induced potentiation of inhibitory glycine receptor currents in VTA neurons (110). Also, mice expressing mutant glycine receptors show reduced sedative and hypnotic responses to ethanol (111). PKCε forms a functional signaling complex with N-type calcium channels, through its interaction with the scaffolding protein enigma homolog protein-1 (ENH1) (112). Scaffolding proteins (as discussed below) enable kinases to efficiently couple to specific substrates. Together with the finding that mice lacking functional N-type calcium channels show decreased hypnotic responses to ethanol and consume less ethanol (113); this suggests one mechanism by which PKCε may couple to these channels and rapidly regulate their activity in response to ethanol. Finally, activation of PKCε through the metabotropic glutamate receptor, mGluR5, is also part of a pathway that underlies ethanol consumption (114). mGluR5 activation increases the activated pool of PKCε, and mGluR5-specific antagonists reduce ethanol consumption in wild-type, but not in PKCε knockout, mice (114). Together, these studies emphasize the critical role played by PKC isoforms in determining behavioral sensitivity to ethanol.

Cdk5. Cdk5 is a member of the cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) family of serine/threonine protein kinases. It associates with the neuron-specific activator and adaptor proteins, p35 and p39, to phosphorylate a large number of substrates (115). Cdk5 has well-characterized roles during neurodevelopment, as it is involved in such processes as neuronal migration, axonal growth, and path finding (115). It has also been implicated in dopaminergic signaling within the adult central nervous system, through its phosphorylation of the dopamine- and cyclic AMP-regulated phosphoprotein (DARPP-32) (115) and its ability to inhibit presynaptic dopamine release in the striatum (116). Not surprising, therefore, is the emergence of a role for Cdk5 in adaptations, resulting from cocaine exposure (117). Cdk5 is a downstream target gene of ΔFosB, and overexpression of ΔFosB or chronic cocaine exposure increases Cdk5 mRNA, protein, and activity in the striatum (Fig. 3) (68). However, intra-Nac administration of a Cdk5 inhibitor enhances sensitization to cocaine-induced locomotor hyperactivity (68), which suggests that Cdk5 is part of a pathway that counteracts and,

therefore, dampens behavioral responses to cocaine. A more recent study using transgenic mice that overexpress either Cdk5 or its activator protein, p35, suggests that increases in p35 expression, rather than increases in Cdk5 itself, lead to inhibition of cocaine-mediated dopaminergic signaling through the attenuation of cocaine-induced PKA and CREB phosphorylation, which results in decreased activation of cFos in the striatum (Fig. 3) (118). And finally, the well-documented increase in dendritic spine density that occurs in the Nac after repeated cocaine exposure (119) has been shown to depend on the activity of Cdk5 (120). Thus, Cdk5 is implicated in both functional and structural plastic changes associated with cocaine use through its regulation of numerous signal transduction pathways, including the PKA pathway.

DARPP-32. DARPP-32 is a 32-kD protein that is expressed predominantly in striatal medium spiny neurons and is an important regulator of dopaminergic signaling (121). The activity of DARPP-32 as either a phosphatase inhibitor or a kinase inhibitor depends on the phosphorylation state of two threonine residues. Activation of the cAMP-PKA pathway leads to DARPP-32 phosphorylation at threonine 34 (Thr<sup>34</sup>), and phospho-Thr<sup>34</sup>-DARPP-32 is a potent inhibitor of the serine/threonine phosphatase, protein phosphatase-1 (PP1) (Fig. 2) (121). On the other hand, phosphorylation of DARPP-32 by Cdk5 at Thr<sup>75</sup> results in its inhibition of PKA (Fig. 3) (122). As mentioned above, Cdk5 is up-regulated after repeated administration of cocaine (67, 68). As a result of the increased expression of Cdk5, the abundance of phospho-Thr<sup>75</sup>-DARPP-32 is increased in rats chronically treated with cocaine, and PKA-mediated phosphorylation of DARPP-32 at Thr<sup>34</sup> is markedly reduced (Fig. 3) (68). In addition, mice lacking the gene that encodes DARPP-32 exhibit higher rates of locomotor sensitization in response to repeated injections of cocaine (123). Together, these results suggest that the increase in Cdk5 abundance and activity, which leads to the phosphorylation of DARPP-32 at Thr<sup>75</sup>, counteracts the D1-type receptor-mediated persistent activation of the cAMP-PKA pathway in response to cocaine.

More recently, DARPP-32 has been shown to be an important link between two major signaling pathways, functioning as a molecular connection between dopamine-induced activation of the cAMP-PKA pathway and activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway. The ERK pathway plays a vital role in mechanisms that underlie several forms of synaptic plasticity (124), and drug addiction is thought to be an aberrant form of learning (125). It is not surprising, therefore, that ERK phosphorylation has been detected in mouse brain after acute administration of various drugs of abuse, including cocaine, or that systemic administration of ERK pathway inhibitors attenuates cocaine-induced conditioned place preference (126). Moreover, recent studies have demonstrated that the activity of ERK in the central amygdala is both necessary and sufficient to induce craving for cocaine during withdrawal (127). Interestingly, ERK activation by cocaine and other drugs of abuse is abolished in the striatum of DARPP-32 knockout mice (128). Cocaine-induced phosphorylation of ERK is also prevented in the striatum of knock-in mice in which Thr<sup>34</sup> of DARPP-32 is mutated to an alanine residue (128). In contrast, no difference in cocaine-induced ERK activation is observed in mice bearing a point mutation in Thr<sup>75</sup> of DARPP-32, compared with wild-type littermates (128). Thus, the use of these knock-in mice elegantly demonstrates that it is the PKA-mediated phosphorylation of Thr<sup>34</sup>-DARPP-32, as

well as the subsequent inhibition of PP-1, that is necessary for
the downstream activation of the ERK pathway in response to
cocaine (Fig. 2). Finally, either pharmacological inhibition of
ERK or genetic inhibition of the ERK pathway (with the point-
mutated Thr³⁴-DARPP-32 mice) significantly attenuates co-
caine-induced behavioral sensitization (128). Together, these re-
sults suggest an important role for DARPP-32 in controlling
ERK activation in the striatum in response to drugs of abuse
such as cocaine.

A role for DARPP-32 in the regulation of pathways modulat-
ed by ethanol has also been elucidated. Ethanol, like other drugs
of abuse, enhances dopamine release in the striatum. Activation
of the cAMP-PKA pathway, through dopamine D1 receptors,
leads to the phosphorylation of the NR1 subunit of the
NMDAR, as well as to DARPP-32 phosphorylation (Fig. 2)
(129). Phospho-Thr³⁴-DARPP-32 inhibits the function of PP1,
which would otherwise dephosphorylate the NR1 subunit
(Fig. 2). The net result is an increase in NMDAR phosphoryla-
tion, which increases channel activity and counteracts ethanol's
inhibitory effects on channel function (129). NMDARs are im-
portant mediators of neuronal plasticity and are required for
most forms of long-term potentiation (LTP), a process that may
represent a critical cellular mechanism underlying learning and
memory (130). NMDARs are also one of the main targets of
ethanol in the brain and, as such, have been implicated in medi-
ating ethanol-associated phenotypes such as intoxication, toler-
ance, dependence, withdrawal, craving, and relapse (131). Thus,
the DARPP-32-mediated increase in NMDAR activity is likely
to be an important factor in NMDAR-dependent LTP and,
hence, long-term neuronal adaptations to ethanol. It is worth
noting that although the NR1 subunit is ubiquitous throughout
the brain, the enhancement in NMDAR-mediated activity in re-
sponse to ethanol only occurs in striatal neurons that contain D1
receptor-DARPP-32. Thus, this pathway is a prime example of
the brain-region specificity of molecular cascades underlying
drug responses. Finally, the contribution of DARPP-32 to
ethanol-mediated behaviors has been tested using DARPP-32
knockout mice. These mice consumed less ethanol than did
wild-type mice and were less responsive to the rewarding
actions of ethanol as measured by the conditioned place-prefer-
ence paradigm (132). Thus, DARPP-32 appears to be behav-
iorally relevant to ethanol's actions in the striatum.
Fyn and Src. The closely related non-receptor tyrosine ki-
nases Fyn and Src are important regulators of NMDAR function
and NMDAR-mediated synaptic plasticity (133). GPCR and re-
ceptor tyrosine kinase signaling pathways converge through the
activation of the Fyn and Src kinases, their subsequent phos-
phorylation of tyrosine residues on the NR2 subunits of
NMDARs, and the ensuing enhancement of channel activity
(133). Recent data suggest that alterations in the phosphoryla-
tion state of NR2 subunits after ethanol exposure modulate
NMDAR activity and thus contribute to the molecular mecha-
nisms that underlie the behavioral effects of ethanol (24).
Specifically, acute ethanol treatment exerts opposing actions on
Fyn and Src activities, which leads to differential phosphoryla-
tion and, hence, altered function of NR2A-containing versus
NR2B-containing NMDARs. Acute ethanol treatment in hip-
pocampal slices results in Fyn phosphorylation of the NR2B
subunit (134). This phosphorylation leads to the reduction of
the inhibitory actions of ethanol on NMDAR-mediated activity
during the acute phase of ethanol exposure and in a rebound

potentiation of channel activity above baseline when ethanol is
washed out (134, 135). Fyn phosphorylation of NR2B also con-
tributes to the development of acute tolerance of NMDAR
activity to ethanol's inhibitory effects (Fig. 4) (134, 135), and
this molecular mechanism is likely to contribute to the duration
of ethanol intoxication and the development of acute behavioral
tolerance, because the deletion of the Fyn gene (135) or sys-
temic injection with the NR2B-specific antagonist ifenprodil
(136) prolongs the LORR to intoxicating doses of ethanol.
Conversely, exposure of hippocampal slices to ethanol results
in the inhibition of Src activity (137). Src inhibition, in turn, pre-
vents phosphorylation of the NR2A subunit (138) and contributes
to NR2A internalization from surface membrane sites in the pres-
ence of ethanol (Fig. 4) (137). As a result of this reduction in the
surface expression of NR2A, the contribution of this subunit to the
activity of the receptor in the presence of ethanol is reduced,
whereas the contribution of NR2B-containing receptors is in-
creased (137). Taken together, these results suggest divergent ac-
tions of ethanol on the activity of these two closely related kinases,
which leads to the differential modulation of NR2A-containing
versus NR2B-containing NMDARs. This switch in the subunit
composition of functional NMDARs is likely to contribute to
long-lasting plastic changes in synaptic function that ultimately
underlie phenotypes associated with alcohol abuse.

### Anchoring and Scaffolding Proteins

Signaling cascades must be tightly regulated with respect to
both the spatial and temporal organization of individual compo-
nents and the specificity of protein-protein interactions (39,
102). Anchoring and scaffolding proteins play major roles in
this regard. For example, they can interact with kinases to bring
them in close proximity to, or keep them apart from, substrate
proteins. They can also provide structural stability by anchoring
proteins to intracellular networks, such as the actin cytoskele-
ton, or serve as platforms on which multiprotein signaling com-
plexes can assemble, which allows tightly orchestrated events to
occur. In the following section, we consider evidence suggest-
ing that three such proteins (Homer, PSD-95, and RACK1) play
important roles in neuroadaptations following cocaine use,
ethanol use, or both.

#### Homer

Homer proteins are closely related scaffolding pro-
teins that are the products of three independent genes (*Homer1*,
2, and 3) (139). These genes can give rise to constitutively ex-
pressed long isoforms (e.g., *Homer1b*, *c*, *d*; *Homer2a*, *b*; and
*Homer3*) and immediate-early gene (short) isoforms (e.g.,
*Homer1a*) (140). Long Homer isoforms assemble as multimers
and can thereby couple group I metabotropic glutamate recep-
tors (mGluRs) to inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptors
and ryanodine receptors (141), which mediate the release of
calcium from intracellular stores, as well as tethering mGluRs
to ionotropic glutamate receptors at postsynaptic sites (142).
Furthermore, Homer proteins regulate the membrane trafficking
of mGluRs (139) and link mGluR5s to the ERK signaling cas-
cade, which results in *c-fos* gene expression (143).

Growing evidence suggests a role for the activation of
mGluRs in mediating the behavioral actions of cocaine and
ethanol. This receptor family consists of mGluR1 and mGluR5,
and receptor activation leads to the activation of phospholipase
C (PLC) through Gαq. This, in turn, generates lipid second mes-
sengers and releases calcium from intracellular stores, which re-
sults in PKC activation. A mGluR5-specific antagonist has been

Fig. 4. The scaffolding protein, RACK1, and Fyn and Src tyrosine kinases lead to adaptations after acute ethanol exposure. Under physiological conditions, Fyn is separated from its substrate, the NR2B subunit of the NMDAR, by the scaffolding protein RACK1. Src kinase is also localized to the NMDAR complex, where it can phosphorylate its substrate, the NR2A subunit. Acute ethanol exposure leads to the release of RACK1 from NR2B-containing NMDARs and its subsequent translocation to the nucleus, where it increases the expression of BDNF in the dorsal striatum (DS). The increase in BDNF abundance reduces behaviors associated with ethanol consumption in rodents. In contrast, the release of RACK1 from the Fyn-RACK1-NMDAR complex allows Fyn to phosphorylate the NR2B subunit—a mechanism that contributes to the development of acute tolerance to ethanol. Src activity is inhibited in the presence of ethanol, which leads to a reduction in NR2A phosphorylation and an increased internalization of NR2A-containing NMDARs. This results in an increased functional contribution of NR2B-containing NMDARs in the presence of ethanol. CPP, conditioned place preference.

specifically in the medial Nac (148). Intra-Nac infusion of Homer1 antisense oligonucleotides, which decreased the abundance of Homer1b and Homer1c proteins by about 35%, caused an increase in cocaine-induced locomotor activity after a single injection of cocaine, as well as an increase in sensitization to cocaine after repeated injections (149). These behavioral results may be somewhat difficult to interrupt, however, because the antisense sequence could also have decreased the abundance of the short Homer1a isoform. Homer1a is rapidly and transiently expressed during neuronal activity (150, 151) and has been shown to act in a dominant-negative fashion by competing with the long isoforms of Homer proteins, which leads to the disassembly of multimeric signaling complexes (139, 152). Homer1a expression is up-regulated in the striatum after exposure to amphetamine (153) and cocaine (154); hence, it would be of interest to determine whether this increase in Homer1a abundance negatively regulates the function of the other Homer proteins.

Homer2 deletion results in null mutant mice with abnormalities in glutamatergic neurotransmission that mimic the neurochemical adaptations observed after repeated cocaine administration (155). Behaviorally, these mutant mice show an increase in the rewarding properties of cocaine and increased sensitization of cocaine-induced locomotor hyperactivity (155). Both the neurochemical adaptations and the behavioral hypersensitivity to cocaine observed in the Homer2 deletion mice are restored to normal levels by viral-mediated overexpression of Homer2b in the Nac of the mutant mice (155). Furthermore, overexpression of the long form of Homer proteins (Homer1c, 2a, or 2b), but not the short form (Homer1a), into the Nac of rats, reversed the expression of cocaine sensitization (156). A potential role for Homer2 proteins in ethanol's action has also recently been suggested. Homer2 null mice consume less alcohol than their wild-type littermates in a two-bottle-choice paradigm and do not develop place preference or locomotor sensitization after repeated ethanol administration (157). These mutant mice also do not exhibit the characteristic neurochemical adaptations associated with repeated ethanol administration, such as increases in extracellular concentrations of dopamine or glutamate in the Nac (157). This suggests similar roles for Homer2 proteins in pathways underlying the development

shown to reduce cocaine self-administration (144, 145) and cocaine-induced reinstatement (145), to attenuate the acute increase in locomotor activity after cocaine administration (146), and to decrease voluntary ethanol consumption in a PKCε-dependent manner (114). In addition, cocaine-mediated hyperlocomotor activity and cocaine self-administration are abolished in mGluR5 knockout mice (147). Taken together, the results suggest that these behaviors are mediated, at least in part, by the activation of this specific subtype of mGluRI.

Evidence supporting the possibility that alterations in the levels of Homer proteins contribute to adaptations after long-term exposure to cocaine stems from a study that reported that 3 weeks' withdrawal from repeated cocaine administration resulted in a decrease in Homer1b and Homer1c protein abundance

ment of drug-induced behaviors with both cocaine and alcohol.

Finally, the Homer-associated receptors, mGluRIs, were recently found to be linked to the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) through the formation of a complex between the receptor, the kinase, and a newly identified protein, PI3K enhancer (PIKE) (158). Interestingly, PI3K has also been implicated as being necessary for the expression of behavioral sensitization to cocaine. Rats given a PI3K inhibitor did not show sensitization to cocaine (159), which raises the possibility that the cocaine-mediated changes in the level of Homer proteins contribute to the activity of PI3K during the expression of behavioral sensitization.

In summary, the observed changes in expression of the long Homer isoforms are likely to play a role in the cellular neuroplasticity and behavioral adaptations observed after repeated exposure to, and withdrawal from, drugs of abuse such as cocaine and ethanol.

PSD-95. An elegant study led to the identification of striatal transcripts whose expressions are altered after repeated cocaine administration in four mouse models of dopamine- or psychostimulant-hypersensitivity (160). The expression of postsynaptic density protein–95 (PSD-95) is reduced in all four lines of mice, and this reduction is specific to the striatum (160). PSD-95 is a postsynaptic scaffolding protein that clusters NMDARs at glutamatergic synapses, connecting the receptors to the cytoskeleton and to signaling proteins that regulate channel function (161). As such, PSD-95 has been implicated in plastic changes in synaptic function underlying learning and memory (161). To elucidate the potential role of the decrease in PSD-95 levels in behavioral adaptations to chronic cocaine exposure, genetically engineered mice that lack functional PSD-95 protein were tested in the cocaine sensitization paradigm (160). The mice were supersensitive to the acute stimulatory actions of cocaine, but did not exhibit further increases in locomotor activity after repeated injection of the drug (160). These results suggest that the decrease in PSD-95 abundance may contribute to the development of behavioral sensitization to cocaine. Interestingly, PSD-95 is phosphorylated by Cdk5 (Fig. 3), and this phosphorylation reduces the synaptic clustering of NMDARs (162). Therefore, Cdk5-mediated phosphorylation of PSD-95 may lead to further dysregulation of PSD-95 function in the striatum in the presence of cocaine.

RACK1. As previously mentioned, ethanol does not have a well-defined pharmacological target; however, it, like other drugs of abuse, can alter signaling pathways that lead to specific changes in gene expression. Over the past several years, it has become apparent that one of the molecular mechanisms by which ethanol can alter signaling pathways is by altering the compartmentalization of proteins. Specifically, altered compartmentalization of the anchoring and scaffolding protein RACK1 inhibits the activity of certain kinases and enhances the activity of others, and increases the expression of certain genes. Furthermore, the functional outcomes of the altered localization of RACK1 in the presence of ethanol are diverse, because RACK1 contributes both to mechanisms that underlie acute tolerance to ethanol and to pathways that prevent the escalation of some behaviors involved in alcohol addiction.

RACK1 was originally cloned and identified as a PKCβII-anchoring protein (163). In recent years, the spectrum of RACK1 functions as a scaffolding protein has broadened, and numerous additional proteins, including other kinases, phosphatases, phosphodiesterases, and the intracellular tails of various receptors, have been identified as RACK1 binding partners (164). A unique feature of RACK1 is its ability to translocate to different intracellular compartments when specific signal transduction cascades are activated (104, 165). Acute ethanol exposure leads to the translocation of RACK1 to the nucleus (97, 104, 166), and this altered compartmentalization of RACK1 results in the diminished activation of PKCβII (104) and in the enhancement of Fyn activity (134), a mechanism that contributes to the development of acute tolerance to ethanol (Fig. 4) (136). Furthermore, nuclear RACK1 mediates the increased expression of the immediate-early gene c-fos, as well as increasing the expression of the BDNF gene (97, 166). In vivo evidence suggests that the RACK1-mediated increases in BDNF abundance in the dorsal striatum are part of a homeostatic pathway that regulates behaviors such as voluntary ethanol intake and ethanol sensitization (Fig. 4) (97). Voluntary ethanol self-administration results in increased abundance of BDNF in the dorsal striatum, and increasing BDNF expression through systemic administration of RACK1 [expressed as a Tat-fusion protein (Tat-RACK1)] decreases ethanol consumption and sensitization (97). And finally, mice heterozygous for the BDNF allele, which roughly halves the abundance of BDNF, consume more ethanol and show higher place-preference and sensitization to ethanol (96, 97). Taken together, these results suggest that the increase in BDNF expression caused by ethanol attenuates sensitivity to ethanol. In summary, the altered compartmentalization of RACK1 in the presence of ethanol results in diverse physiological consequences that both contribute to, and prevent, the development of behaviors associated with alcohol addiction.

### Future Directions

In the past decade, due largely to advances in molecular biology and transgenic mouse technology, there has been tremendous progress in our understanding of the molecular signaling mechanisms underlying drug and alcohol addiction. Here, we have reviewed some major findings elucidating signaling cascades that change protein expression levels and compartmentalization, which lead to changes in protein phosphorylation states and ultimately to short- and long-term changes in gene expression. These pathways, as described, are responsible for behaviors such as voluntary drug and alcohol intake, sensitization, and reward.

Although much has been learned about the voluntary intake of drugs in rodents, self-administration is not the same as the compulsive, relentless drive toward drug-seeking and drug-taking that characterizes addiction. Thus, animal models that more closely represent human addiction would greatly help in achieving a more molecular-based understanding of the disease process. Two recent studies, using much longer drug self-administration exposures than have typically been used previously, have substantially advanced our ability to model compulsive drug-taking in the rat (167, 168). Animal models such as these will not only be useful for identifying molecular mechanisms that are altered in those animals displaying addiction-like behavior, but should also be effective as preclinical models for the development of new medications to treat addiction.

It is also relevant to note that in one of the aforementioned studies, only a small subset (17%) of rats developed addiction-like behaviors, even though all rats readily self-administered cocaine for prolonged periods of time (167). This is similar to the human condition, in which fewer than 10% of cocaine users progress to addiction (169). This, therefore, is strong evidence
in support of current thinking that addiction not only results from repeated drug exposure, but also depends on the degree of vulnerability of the individual. Why some individuals are more susceptible to transitioning toward addiction than others is one of the important questions in this field. Underlying genetic predispositions are most likely involved, and large-scale human genetic studies (170, 171), together with animal models of addiction-like behaviors (167, 168), should help identify genes that influence susceptibility to becoming a substance abuser.

Microarray studies have identified various gene clusters whose expressions are altered in rodents after exposure to alcohol and cocaine (154, 160, 172, 173). However, the primary versus secondary changes remain to be elucidated; furthermore, changes at the mRNA level may not always correlate with functional changes at the protein and signal transduction level. Recent advances in technologies such as proteomics (174, 175), which allows the identification of large-scale protein signaling networks, will permit a deeper understanding of signaling pathways in general, which can be applied to those that are up- or down-regulated during drug-induced responses.

Considering, however, that long-term molecular and cellular adaptations underlying addiction involve changes at the level of gene expression, it is surprising to find that very few transcription factors have been implicated so far. Moreover, even less is known about the identity of the genes that they regulate. CREB and ΔFosB are notable exceptions (4, 176), and Clock is another transcription factor that has been implicated in modulating drug-induced behavioral responses. Clock, a member of the basic helix-loop-helix-PAS (PER-ARNT-SIM) transcription factor family, was identified for its role in the generation of circadian rhythms in most tissues, including most brain regions (177). An association between circadian-associated genes and behavioral responses to drugs of abuse was initially observed in *Drosophila*, where behavioral sensitivity to cocaine was shown to depend not only on expression of the *Clock* gene, but also on downstream targets of Clock: Period (*Per*), cycle, and doubletime (178). More recently, *Clock* mutant mice were found to have high levels of cocaine-induced locomotor sensitization and developed increased conditioned place preference for the area where they received cocaine, compared with wild-type littermates, demonstrating an increased response to the rewarding effects of cocaine (179). This was associated with increased expression and phosphorylation of tyrosine hydroxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme in dopamine synthesis, as well as in several other genes known to regulate dopamine activity in the VTA (179). Whether these gene products are under the direct transcriptional regulation of Clock, or are secondary changes, remains to be determined.

One of the downstream targets of Clock in mammals, Per2, has also been associated with drug-related behaviors. *Per2* knockout mice are hypersensitive to cocaine and show a strong cocaine-induced place preference (180), and *Per2<sup>Brdm1</sup>* mutant mice, which express a nonfunctional form of the Per2 protein, have increased ethanol intake (181). Variations in the human *Per2* gene are associated with alcohol consumption, which suggests that this gene influences alcohol intake in humans (181). This study also established dysfunction in the glutamatergic system, caused by excessive concentrations of extracellular glutamate in the ventral striatum of the *Per2<sup>Brdm1</sup>* mutant mice, as a potential mechanism linking dysfunction in this circadian-associated gene with enhanced alcohol consumption. Of therapeutic relevance, the high ethanol consumption of the mutant mice could be reversed to low levels of intake by treating the mice with acamprosate (181), an FDA-approved medication for treating alcoholism that is thought to act by dampening hyperglutamatergic states in the brain (182). Thus, *Clock* and other downstream circadian-associated genes may modulate a pathway that is common to many drugs of abuse and that influences both dopaminergic and glutamatergic systems, ultimately modulating drug-related behaviors. The identification of other nuclear factors important in regulating transcriptional events, such as Hangover, a novel nucleic acid-binding protein involved in ethanol tolerance development in *Drosophila* (183), should lead to a more detailed understanding of the various pathways involved in behavioral adaptations to drugs of abuse.

It would also be of great interest to dissect the cascades of molecular events that lead to changes in the abundance of proteins, such as Homer, AGS3, RGS9-2, and others, and to determine whether inhibition or activation of ubiquitin ligases, proteases, or transcriptional activation, are responsible for these changes (184). Even more challenging will be achieving an understanding of how some proteins are up-regulated only long after drug clearance. For example, the increase in the abundance of AGS3 protein has only been detected 3 weeks after cocaine withdrawal and persists for up to 8 weeks (31). Other molecular mechanisms, which include the up-regulation of proteins immediately after chronic administration of a drug, such as RGS9-2 (36), must be responsible for the initiation of drug-seeking behaviors that directly follow withdrawal. Also not well understood are the mechanisms that lead to adaptations that are restricted to specific brain regions. For example, exposure to cocaine leads to an increase in GluR1 abundance specifically in the VTA (51), and ethanol exposure initiates changes in the phosphorylation state of NMDAR subunits in the hippocampus but not in the cortex (134).

Pioneering studies demonstrated that chronic cocaine exposure in rats results in changes in spine density and dendrite morphology (119). Very little is known about the initial molecular changes that underpin these structural adaptations; however, such neuroplasticity is likely to be important in maintaining the life-long disease of addiction. In recent years, the mechanisms that lead to alterations in dendritic spines under physiological conditions and in disease states other than addiction are starting to be revealed (185), and these findings are likely to be very helpful in dissecting alterations that occur in these pathways with respect to addiction.

Finally, in addition to elucidating pathways that underlie the development and expression of addiction phenotypes, we, and others, have generated evidence to suggest the existence of pathways that may prevent, or reduce, the development of addiction. RACK1 and BDNF have recently been identified as contributing to a homeostatic mechanism that is activated on exposure of rodents to ethanol and that reduces behavioral sensitivity to this drug (97). In addition, although Cdk5 expression levels are increased on repeated exposure to cocaine, administration of a Cdk5 inhibitor enhanced cocaine-induced sensitization (68), which suggests that Cdk5 is part of a pathway that dampens behavioral responses to cocaine. These “antiaddiction” cascades should be further explored, especially in light of the possibility that mutations in genes that are part of these cascades may increase the susceptibility of humans to develop addiction.
Conclusion
Historically, therapeutic drug development has largely been focused on molecules that bind to and modulate the activity of receptors. Over the past decade, much progress has been made in the discovery and development of new drugs that target intracellular signaling pathways to treat diseases such as cancer, inflammation, and neurodegenerative disorders [for examples, see (186, 187)]. These advances, together with the recent identification of intracellular signaling cascades that are activated or inhibited during and after drug exposure, open new opportunities for developing medications to treat the chronic and devastating disease of drug addiction.

relapse in addicts (e.g., an acute administration of the drug).

Conditioned place preference. Conditioned place preference is a procedure that measures the rewarding or aversive properties of a drug. The conditioned place-preference apparatus consists of two chambers with overt differences in visual and textural cues. During the conditioning period, one chamber is paired with injection of the drug (such as cocaine or ethanol), and the other with vehicle. After several conditioning sessions, the animal is placed in the apparatus and allowed free movement between the chambers for a fixed time period. If the animal spends more time in the chamber that was paired with the drug, the drug is considered rewarding. If the animal prefers the vehicle-paired chamber, the drug is considered aversive.

Behavioral sensitization. Behavioral sensitization is a process in which repeated intermittent administration of the same dose of a drug results in an augmentation in the behavioral response. Behavioral sensitization is used as a model to study molecular and cellular changes that lead to neuronal alterations (neuroplasticity events), which result from repeated drug exposure. Sensitization can persist for long periods after discontinuation of drug use and is thought to be an important contributing factor in compulsive drug-taking and drug craving (188). Cocaine- and ethanol-induced sensitization is measured by an increase in locomotor activity after repeated drug administration.

Loss of righting reflex. Loss of righting reflex is an assay used to assess the acute sedative-hypnotic response to ethanol. Mice are injected with an intoxicating dose of ethanol and then placed in a supine position. The duration of intoxication is measured by the length of time it takes to revert to the righted position.
