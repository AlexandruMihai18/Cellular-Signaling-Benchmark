Angiotensin (Ang) II acts as a mitogen in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) via the activation of multiple signaling cascades, including phospholipase C, tyrosine kinase, and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways. However, increasing evidence supports signal-activated phospholipases A₂ and D (PLD) as additional mechanisms. Stimulation of PLD results in phosphatidic acid (PA) formation, and PA has been linked to cell growth. However, the direct involvement of PA or its metabolite diacylglycerol (DAG) in Ang II-induced growth is unclear. PLD activity was measured in cultured rat VSMC prelabeled with [³H]oleic acid, while the incorporation of [³H]thymidine was used to monitor growth. We have previously reported the Ang II-dependent, AT₁-coupled stimulation of PLD and growth in VSMC. Here, we show that Ang II (100 nM) and exogenous PLD (0.1–100 units/mL; Streptomyces chromofuscus) stimulated thymidine incorporation (43–208% above control). PA (100 nM–1 μM) also increased thymidine incorporation to 135% of control. Propranolol (100 nM–10 μM), which inhibits PA phosphohydrolase, blocked the growth stimulated by Ang II, PLD, or PA by as much as 95%, an effect not shared by other β-adrenergic antagonists. Propranolol also increased the production of PA in the presence of Ang II by 320% and reduced DAG and arachidonic acid (AA) accumulation. The DAG lipase inhibitor RHC-80267 (1–10 μM) increased Ang II-induced DAG production, while attenuating thymidine incorporation and release of AA. Thus, it appears that activation of PLD, formation of PA, conversion of PA to DAG, and metabolism of DAG comprise an important signaling cascade in Ang II-induced growth of VSMC.

Angiotensin (Ang)²II acts as both a vasoconstrictor and a mitogen in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). This peptide mediates its effects through the activation of multiple signaling cascades. Ang II coupled to an AT₁ receptor activates phospholipase C (PLC) giving rise to inositol trisphosphate (IP₃) and diacylglycerol (DAG) (1). These second messengers have been linked to the mobilization of intracellular Ca²⁺ and the activation of protein kinase C (PKC), respectively. It is these events which are involved in increased vascular smooth muscle tone as well as in the initiation of VSMC mitogenesis. In addition, Ang II-mediated VSMC growth appears to involve activation of protein tyrosine kinases (2) leading to the stimulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) (3). The extent to which this pathway mediates the Ang II-dependent growth of VSMC is currently unknown. However, increasing evidence suggests that additional mechanisms are involved, including signal-activated phospholipases A₂ (4) and D (PLD) (5).

Many investigators have demonstrated the activation of PLD in various cell types (6–8), including VSMC (9). Activation of PLD catalyzes the hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine (PC), producing phosphatidic acid (PA) and choline. The molecular identification and

characterization of PLD has recently been described and two mammalian genes, PLD1 and PLD2, have been cloned (10, 11). PLD1 appears to be membrane associated and phosphatidylcholine-specific with low basal activity and appears to be signal activated, while PLD2 is constitutively active and shows little response to stimuli (12). In VSMC, Ang II is a potent activator of PLD and is coupled to the activation of this lipase through the AT₁ receptor-mediated accumulation of intracellular Ca²⁺ (9, 13). Furthermore, increased PLD activity is a component of multiple receptor-linked mitogenic signaling cascades, such as those induced by PDGF and endothelin (14, 15). PLD activity is also increased in the presence of activated tyrosine kinases in neutrophils and fibroblasts (16, 17) and appears to play a role in the growth of VSMC independent of MAPK (5). Therefore, it has been suggested that PLD may be involved in the physiological control of cell proliferation mediated by the activation of specific cell-surface receptors. Further involvement of PLD activation in cellular mitogenesis is supported by findings that PA is an important second messenger for mediating DNA synthesis (18) and cellular proliferation (19). It has also been reported that exposure of cells to exogenous PLD causes increased PA formation and mimics the effects of mitogenic stimulation (14).

Activation of PLD also results in a long-lasting increase in the formation of diacylglycerol (DAG) in VSMC (1, 9). DAG is formed through the conversion of PA via PA phosphohydrolase (20) and it has been suggested that agonist-induced formation of DAG in VSMC occurs largely through this pathway. The contribution of DAG to the Ang II- or PLD-mediated mitogenesis in VSMC has not been completely described. DAG may be further metabolized via diglyceride lipase giving rise to free fatty acids. Indeed, the Ang II-induced accumulation of arachidonic acid occurs partially via a diglyceride lipase-dependent mechanism in VSMC (21). Also, recent studies report that free fatty acids promote cellular mitogenesis (22, 23) and implicate arachidonic acid in the cellular growth stimulated by various agonists, including PDGF, endothelin, and norepinephrine (24, 25). Therefore, we investigated the involvement of PLD activation and the subsequent signaling cascade which results in the formation and further metabolism of DAG in the Ang II-induced growth of VSMC. Here, we have demonstrated that stimulation of VSMC with Ang II results in the formation of PA and DAG and the release of AA which is associated with an increase in DNA synthesis. In addition, inhibition of PA conversion to DAG attenuated VSMC growth stimulated by Ang II. Furthermore, preventing the metabolism of DAG by inhibiting diglyceride lipase activity reduced Ang II-induced VSMC growth. Similarly, stimulation with exogenous PLD (Streptomyces chromofuscus) caused VSMC growth which was also

attenuated through inhibition of PA and DAG metabolism. These results support the importance of PLD activation, the formation of DAG and its further metabolism via diglyceride lipase in the Ang II-induced growth of VSMC.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Materials. [³H]oleic acid (7.2 Ci/mmol) and [³H]thymidine (5 Ci/mmol) were purchased from Dupont-New England Nuclear (Boston, MA). Trypsin/EDTA were from Bio-Whittaker (Walkersville, MD). All phospholipids were from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Ang II was purchased from Bachem (Torrance, CA) and RHC-80267 was purchased from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). Subtype-selective adrenergic receptor antagonists were purchased from Tochris Cookson (Ballwin, MO). DMEM/F12, fetal bovine serum (FBS), PLD (Streptomyces chromofuscus; fraction VII), and all other chemicals were from Sigma (St. Louis, MO).

Cell culture. VSMC cultured from rat aorta were prepared by explant culture using a previously published procedure (9). Cells were identified as VSMC by their characteristic morphology as well as with antibodies to VSMC-specific α-actin (Sigma). Cells were routinely used between passages 3 and 10.

Phospholipase D assay. The activity of VSMC PLD was determined by measuring the incorporation of metabolically prelabeled phosphatidyl moieties into PA and phosphatidylethanol (PEt). PEt formation was used as a specific assay for PLD stimulation, since PLD will catalyze a transphosphatidylation reaction to produce PEt in the presence of ethanol. To label VSMC phospholipids, preconfluent cells in 6-well plates were incubated for 24 h with [³H]oleic acid (2 μCi/well; 7.2 Ci/mmol, New England Nuclear) in 2 mL of DMEM/F12 containing 10% FBS. Under these conditions, the majority of the radiolabel resides in phosphatidylcholine while lesser amounts are found in phosphatidylinositol (PI), phosphatidylserine (PS), and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) (9). After 24 h, the growth medium was removed and replaced with a Kreb’s-Ringer (KR) solution (components in mM; NaCl 125, KCl 5, MgSO₄ 1.2, glucose 6, Hepes 25; pH 7.4) containing 1 mM Ca²⁺. This buffer was removed after 30 min and KR with 0.5% ethanol (EtOH) was introduced for an additional 5 min. Wells were then treated with the appropriate agonists and/or antagonists in the continued presence of 0.5% EtOH for 10 min. The experiments were terminated by aspirating the treatment buffer, placing the cells on ice, and adding ice-cold methanol (1 mL) to each well. The cells were then scraped and the cell suspension was transferred to test tubes. Lipids were extracted by adding 1 mL chloroform and 0.5 mL water, vortexing vigorously and collecting the lower lipid-containing chloroform phase. The lipid extract was dried under nitrogen and redissolved in 30 μL of chloroform:methanol (1:1); aliquots were spotted on precoated 20 × 20-cm Silica Gel LK6D TLC plates (Whatman, U.S.A.) which were developed using the solvent system of ethyl acetate:2,2,4-trimethylpentane:acetic acid:water (13:2:3:10; by volume). Phospholipids were visualized using iodine vapors and PA or PEt was identified by the position of authentic standards. These areas were scraped from the plates into scintillation vials, extracted with 1 mL of methanol, and counted in a liquid scintillation spectrometer after addition of 9 mL Ecolite (ICN Biochemicals, Irvine, CA).

Accumulation of arachidonic acid and diacylglycerol. Cultured VSMC were grown in 6-well culture plates until approximately 80% confluent. Cells were labeled for 24 h with [³H]arachidonic acid (0.5 μCi/well; 100 Ci/mmol) in DMEM/F12 containing 10% FBS. Prelabeled cells were washed with KR buffer containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin to remove any unincorporated label. Buffer (1 mL/well) containing the various treatments and 0.2% bovine serum albumin was added to each well for the indicated periods of time and the reactions were terminated by placing the cells on ice and removing

Note. Cultured VSMC were prelabeled with \[^3H\]oleic acid or \[^3H\]arachidonic acid for 24 h. Cells were washed and exposed to Ang II (100 nM/L) for 10 min in the absence or presence of 0.5% ethanol (EtOH) or to *Streptomyces chromofuscus* PLD (10 units/mL). Lipids were extracted and separated as described under Materials and Methods and the formation of phosphatidic acid (PA), phosphatidylethanol (PET), and diacylglycerol (DAG) or the release of arachidonic acid (AA) were quantitated. Control values are PA 1107 ± 109 cpm/well; PET 689 ± 74 cpm/well; DAG 1290 ± 93 cpm/well; AA 939 ± 42 cpm/well.

ing the incubation medium. To measure release of \[^3H\]AA, the incubation medium was extracted by adding the 1 mL of incubation medium to tubes containing 2 mL each of chloroform:methanol. To determine the accumulation of DAG, ice-cold methanol (2 mL) was immediately added to each well. The cell layer was scraped and extracted as above. The lower organic phases were separated and dried under a stream of nitrogen prior to reconstitution in 30 μL chloroform:methanol (1:1). The lipid samples were further analyzed by TLC on silica gel plates developed in a solvent system of ethyl acetate:hexane:acetic acid:water (17:7:3:18, by volume) for AA and in isopropyl ether:acetic acid (24:1) for DAG. The spots corresponding to authentic AA or DAG were scraped into scintillation vials containing 1 mL methanol and 5 mL Ecolite and counted.

Cell growth assay. VSMC proliferation was determined by quantitating the incorporation of \[^3H\]thymidine as an indicator of DNA synthesis (22). Cells were subcultured into 24-well plates and, prior to confluency, the growth medium was switched to DMEM/F12 without FBS for 48 h to ensure that the cells become quiescent. Once quiescent, appropriate treatments were added to the medium for 24 h. Treatments were added again and cells incubated an additional 24 h in the presence of 0.25 μCi/well \[^3H\]thymidine (5 Ci/mmol, New England Nuclear). To process the cells, the medium was aspirated and 0.3 mL of ice-cold 5% TCA added to each well. The cells were washed with TCA twice prior to being dissolved in 0.2 mL of 0.25 N NaOH. After 30 min, the NaOH solution was removed and placed into scintillation vials containing 5 mL Ecolite for counting.

Statistics. The results are expressed as means ± SEM. Significant differences were determined by analysis of variance and the Bonferroni method. A value of *P* < 0.05 was considered significant.

RESULTS

Ang II-Dependent Activation of PLD and Lipid Metabolism

Ang II activates PLD in VSMC in a time- and dose-dependent manner as indicated by the increased production of \[^3H\]PA and \[^3H\]PET in cells prelabeled with \[^3H\]oleic acid (9). In the current study, we observed that 100 nM/L Ang II mediated a maximal increase in the formation of PA (176% of nonstimulated controls) at 10 min of exposure (Table I) which was attenuated by approximately 33% in the presence of EtOH. In addition, the specific activation of

PLD was confirmed in the presence of EtOH, since Ang II increased the synthesis of \[^3H\]PET more than 2.5-fold at 10 min when compared to controls (Table I). Exposure of cultured VSMC to Ang II (100 nM/L) for 10 min increased the formation of DAG by 87% and the release of AA by 309% when compared to nonstimulated controls (Table I). In addition, PLD (10 units/mL) mediated increases in DAG formation and release of AA (Table I). The effects of this dose were examined, since a dose curve for the effects of PLD on thymidine incorporation had already been established as described below.

Agonist-Stimulated DNA Synthesis in VSMC

As shown previously, Ang II coupled to an AT₁ receptor subtype stimulates the dose-dependent incorporation of \[^3H\]thymidine into cultured VSMC (26). Again, we have shown that in quiescent cells 100 nM/L Ang II increased the incorporation of thymidine by 178% of control (Fig. 1).

Addition of *S. chromofuscus* PLD has been reported to increase the hydrolysis of PC giving rise to PA and choline in VSMC (14). Here, PLD stimulated the dose-dependent increase in DNA synthesis similar to that observed in the presence of Ang II (Fig. 1). Maximal DNA synthesis was observed when quiescent cells were exposed to 10 units/mL PLD which caused an increase in thymidine incorporation of 108% above nonstimulated controls. Like Ang II or PLD, PA at 100 nM/L or 1 μM/L increased the incorporation of thymidine into quiescent cells by 24 or 35%, respectively, when compared to nonstimulated controls (Fig. 2).

Effects of Inhibitors on Stimulated VSMC Growth and Lipid Metabolism

The effects of the above treatments on VSMC responses to Ang II were examined further in the pres-

FIG. 1. Quiescent VSMC were incubated with Ang II (100 nM/L) or S. chromofuscus PLD (0.1–100 units/mL) for 24 h. Treatments were added again and cells were incubated an additional 24 h in the presence of \[^3H\]thymidine. Treatments were aspirated and the incorporation of thymidine quantitated as described under Materials and Methods. Results are expressed as incorporation of thymidine (cpm) per well (nonstimulated incorporation; 4710 ± 198 cpm/well) and values represent means ± SEM from six experiments. *Significantly different from nonstimulated control at \(P < 0.05\).

FIG. 2. VSMC were made quiescent by incubation in serum-free medium for 48 h prior to treatment with phosphatidic acid (PA; 10 nM/L–1 μM/L) for 24 h. Treatments were added again in the presence of \[^3H\]thymidine and cells were incubated for a further 24 h. At this time the incorporation of thymidine was quantitated and results are expressed as cpm/well (means ± SEM; data from six experiments). *Significantly different from nonstimulated incorporation (CNTL; 4710 ± 198 cpm/well) of thymidine (\(P < 0.05\)).

ence of propranolol, which has been shown to inhibit PA phosphohydrolase and the subsequent conversion of PA to DAG (27, 28). Quiescent VSMC were preincubated in the presence of propranolol for 5 min prior to and during stimulation with Ang II. The results of these experiments are shown in Fig. 3. Here, we observed that propranolol dose dependently attenuated the Ang II-mediated DNA synthesis. Propranolol at 10 μM/L blocked VSMC growth, while having no effect on basal thymidine incorporation. Propranolol also inhibited the thymidine incorporation stimulated in the presence of either PLD (10 units/mL) or PA (1 μM/L) by 92 and 78%, respectively (Fig. 4). This effect was specific for propranolol, since neither the \(\beta_1\)-(atenolol) nor the \(\beta_2\)-(ICI118-551) adrenergic receptor antagonists blocked the induced synthesis of DNA (data not shown). Propranolol also dose dependently increased the formation of PA induced by Ang II by as much as 220% (Fig. 5). Conversely, the Ang II-mediated formation of \[^3H\]DAG was dose dependently blocked in the presence of propranolol (Fig. 5) and the Ang II-induced release of AA was reduced 53% (Table II). Responses of VSMC were also monitored in the presence of the diacylglycerol lipase inhibitor RHC-80267. VSMC were preincubated in the presence of 1–10 μM/L RHC-80267 for 5 min. Cell growth was stimulated in the presence of either Ang II (100 nM/L) or PLD (10 units/mL) in the continued presence of the lipase inhibitor. At 1 μM/L,

At this time the incorporation of thymidine was quantitated and results are expressed as cpm/well. Data are reported as means ± SEM from six experiments. *Significantly different from Ang II-induced incorporation of thymidine (\(P < 0.05\)).

ACTIVATION OF PHOSPHOLIPASE D MEDIATES VSMC GROWTH

Ang II-induced activation of PLD in VSMC is coupled to the formation of PA and is correlated with increased cell growth. In addition, the mitogenic effects of Ang II are mimicked by the addition of PLD and are correlated with the formation of PA and its metabolism via PA phosphohydrolase to form DAG. Furthermore, DAG hydrolysis via its lipase appears to play a role in the Ang II-induced, PLD-mediated growth of cultured VSMC.

In this study, as well as in previous reports, Ang II stimulated the activation of PLD as measured by the formation of PA and more specifically the transphosphatidylation of PC to PEt in the presence of ethanol (9, 13). Ang II also increased DNA synthesis. Furthermore, both the stimulation of VSMC growth and the activation of PLD are coupled to an AT₁ receptor (9, 26). The results reported here support the possibility that the agonist-induced increase in VSMC growth may be related to the activation of PLD, since we observed that exogenous PLD enhanced cellular growth and mimicked the effects of Ang II. One mechanism by which PLD may enhance cell growth could include the generation of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) as shown in Rat-1 cells resulting in a G-protein-coupled LPA receptor-mediated activation of Ras, Rho, and Ca²⁺ mobilization (31). However, the addition of PLD is suggested to mimic the growth-promoting effects of PDGF in VSMC through its demonstrated ability to increase the formation of PA and PEt (14). The ability of PLD activation to mediate cell growth may result from the production of PA, since the addition of PA alone increased thymidine incorporation. These findings are consistent with previous studies linking PA to mitogenic signaling (18, 30, 32). Also, it appears that Ang II and PLD may mediate VSMC growth through this pathway, since manipulations of PA metabolism using propranolol resulted in reduced formation of downstream metabolites (i.e., DAG and AA) as well as the inhibition of VSMC growth. Interestingly, it has also been shown that agonist-induced cell growth can be attenuated in the presence of an alcohol (an observation shared by our laboratory, data not presented). This effect is suggested to result from the PLD-mediated formation of PEt at the expense of PA (5, 15) an effect we noted as a reduction in the Ang II-stimulated production of PA in the presence of ethanol.

Despite an established role for PA in mitogenic signaling, this lipid can also be metabolized via PA phosphohydrolase to DAG and the possibility that this event may be involved in agonist-induced cell growth was of interest here. The Ang II-induced activation of PLD has been linked to the formation of DAG in VSMC (1, 9) which occurs in two phases, an initial peak as early as 10 s and a secondary more sustained peak at 10 min. The early production of DAG appears to be PLC-dependent, while stimulation

FIG. 4. Subconfluent monolayers of VSMC were made quiescent as described under Materials and Methods prior to exposure to propranolol (PP; 10 μM/L) or vehicle for 5 min. Cells were then stimulated in the presence of Ang II (100 nM/L), PLD (10 units/mL), or PA (1 μM/L) for 24 h in the continued presence or absence of the inhibitor. Treatments were added again and cells incubated for 24 h in the presence of [³H]thymidine. Media were aspirated and thymidine incorporation was quantitated as described under Materials and Methods. Data are expressed as percentage of serum-free control (4100 ± 159 cpm/well) and represent means ± SEM from five experiments. Significant effects of propranolol were determined by analysis of variance and the Bonferroni method. *Compared to individual stimuli (*P* < 0.05).

RHC-80267 reduced the Ang II- or PLD-mediated growth by 24 or 47%, respectively, while DNA synthesis induced by either Ang II or PLD was blocked 70 or 100% in the presence of 10 μM/L RHC-80267, respectively (Fig. 6). Treatment of the VSMC with RHC-80267 (10 μM/L) also increased the formation of DAG stimulated in the presence of Ang II by 30%, while attenuating the Ang II-mediated increase in AA release by 25% (Table II). RHC-80267 also increased PLD-mediated DAG formation by 47%.

DISCUSSION

The activation of PLD has been reported in response to multiple agonists including PDGF, endothelin, and Ang II; however, the physiological significance of this mitogen-induced activation has not been clearly defined. Recent reports have suggested that PLD activation, formation of PA and its subsequent metabolism are involved in receptor-regulated cell growth and differentiation (28–30). In VSMC stimulated with Ang II, it has been suggested that activation of PLD is required for full mitogenic responses (5). Thus, the activation of PLD by Ang II coupled to an AT₁ receptor may serve as a signal to promote VSMC mitogenesis. Here, we report that the

tion of PLD mediates the secondary increase in DAG (1, 9). Therefore, the activation of PLD by Ang II results not only in the accumulation of PA but also in the formation of DAG as was shown here. It appears that the formation of PA and its subsequent metab-

Note. VSMC were cultured in the presence of either propranolol or RHC-80267 for 5 min prior to and during Ang II (100 nM/L) stimulation. After a 10-min exposure to Ang II, lipids were extracted and separated as described under Materials and Methods and the formation of diacylglycerol (DAG) or the release of arachidonic acid (AA) was quantitated.

olism play a role in this signaling path, since PA itself stimulates DNA synthesis and the effects of Ang II, PLD, or PA can be blocked in the presence of the PA phosphohydrolase inhibitor propranolol. Propranolol has been shown to inhibit the conversion of PA to DAG which is supported by the increased formation of PA and the reciprocal reduction in DAG synthesis induced by Ang II in the presence of the inhibitor. Furthermore, the use of propranolol to inhibit this pathway has been associated with a reduction in agonist-induced cell growth and differentiation in various cell types (28, 29, 33). These effects appear to be specific, since we observed that other β-adrenergic receptor-selective antagonists did not share the growth-attenuating effects of propranolol. These findings support the involvement of PA conversion to DAG in the Ang II-induced activation of PLD and subsequent cell growth. Consistent with these observations, it appears that PDGF-mediated mitogenesis in VSMC cells also depends on the formation of DAG (34, 35) and DAG mimics the effects of mitogens by increasing protein phosphorylation and DNA synthesis (36, 37). However, the subsequent metabolism of DAG by diacylglycerol lipase

tabolism of DAG play a significant role in the Ang II-induced growth of cultured VSMC.
