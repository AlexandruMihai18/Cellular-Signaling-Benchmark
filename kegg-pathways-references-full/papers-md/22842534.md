### ABSTRACT

Mutations in presenilins are responsible for the vast majority of early-onset familial Alzheimer’s disease cases. Full-length presenilin structure is composed of nine transmembrane domains which are localized on the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. Upon endoproteolytic cleavage, presenilins assemble into the γ-secretase multiprotein complex and subsequently get transported to the cell surface. There is a wealth of knowledge around the role of presenilins as the catalytic component of γ-secretase, their involvement in amyloid precursor protein processing and generation of neurotoxic β-amyloid species. However recent findings have revealed a wide range of γ-secretase-independent presenilin functions, including involvement in calcium homeostasis. Particularly, familial Alzheimer’s disease presenilin mutations have been shown to interfere with the function of several molecular elements involved in endoplasmic reticulum calcium homeostasis. Presenilins modulate the activity of IP₃ and Ryanodine receptor channels, regulate SERCA pump function, affect capacitative calcium entry and function *per se* as endoplasmic reticulum calcium leak conductance pores.

### 1. Introduction

Presenilin (PS) mutations account for over 90% of human familial Alzheimer’s disease (FAD) cases. Beyond the intensively characterized role of PS as the catalytic core of γ-secretase multimeric enzyme complex ([De Strooper et al., 2012](#ref1)), presenilins have been shown to be implicated also in a wide range of γ-secretase-independent functions including β-catenin regulation, signal transduction, cell adhesion, protein trafficking and turnover, apoptosis, synaptic function, tau phosphorylation and calcium homeostasis ([Hass et al., 2009](#ref2)). γ-Secretase is responsible for the regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP) of over 60 different substrates, including amyloid precursor protein (APP) and Notch.

Yet, γ-secretase is best known for its involvement in formation of β-amyloid (Aβ) peptide, which is generated from sequential proteolytic cleavage of APP in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) ([De Strooper et al., 2012](#ref1)). The discovery of PS came from the work of [Sherrington et al. (1995)](#ref3). Their genome-wide screen revealed that missense mutations in the PS1 gene (originally known as S182) lead to early-onset FAD cases ([Sherrington et al., 1995](#ref3)). This finding was shortly complemented by an independent study which reported that the PS1 homologous gene in *Caenorhabditis elegans* (sel-12) is implicated in Notch signaling ([Levitan and Greenwald, 1995](#ref4)). Meanwhile, PS homologues have been identified in several other species, ranging from mammals to frogs, flies, worms, fish and plants ([Brunkan and Goate, 2005](#ref5)). PS1 and PS2 are the two highly homologous forms of PS in mammals which are respectively located on chromosomes 14q24.3 and 1q42.2 ([De Strooper et al., 2012](#ref1)). In this review article we mainly highlight the role of PS in the context of calcium signaling, particularly in relation to disrupted calcium homeostasis implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD).

### 2. Structure

Although the crystal structure of PS is not yet resolved, there is strong evidence in favor of a nine transmembrane domain (TMD) structure model ([Fig. 1](#fig1)). PS holoprotein is ~50 kDa in size which undergoes endoproteolysis within a putatively large intracellular loop between TMD6 and TMD7 to generate a ~30 kDa N-terminal

fragment (NTF) and a ~20 kDa C-terminal fragment (CTF) which remain associated as a heterodimer ([De Strooper et al., 2012](#)). NMR studies could only determine the structure of PS1-CTF, containing a half-membrane-spanning helix, a severely kinked helical structure toward the carboxyl terminus as well as a soluble helix in the unstructured amino-terminal loop of the CTF ([Sobhanifar et al., 2010](#)). Despite the lack of NMR structure for PS1-NTF, it is generally agreed upon that the PS1-NTF has a classical transmembrane topology consisting of six α-helices.

### 3. Expression, activation and turnover

The expression of both PS1 and PS2 is detectable throughout the brain, in most adult human tissues and regulated during development ([Brunkan and Goate, 2005](#)). PS is primarily localized to the ER and Golgi apparatus, but also a small fraction is located at the cell surface (Fig. 2) ([Brunkan and Goate, 2005](#)). In the brain, endogenous

PS is predominantly present as N- and C-terminal fragments, while the immature precursor full-length PS holoprotein (PS-FL) is only faintly detectable. This is also reflected by the short half-life (~1.5 h) and rapid turnover of PS-FL compared to its more stable endoproteolytic fragments with longer half-lives (~24 h) ([Ratovitski et al., 1997](#)). However, upon PS overexpression, the NTF and CTF levels reach a saturation threshold, beyond which PS-FL gets accumulated ([Brunkan and Goate, 2005](#)). The proteasomal pathway is responsible for the degradation of PS-FL ([Kim et al., 1997](#)). Endoproteolytic cleavage of PS-FL occurs primarily within the ER. Upon association of PS proteolytic fragments with three other ER transmembrane proteins (Nicastrin, Aph-1 and Pen-2), a complex is formed and subsequently transported to the Golgi through several vesicular transport cycles and trafficked to the plasma membrane where it functions as γ-secretase ([De Strooper et al., 2012](#)).

### 4. Role in calcium homeostasis

In 1994, the involvement of PS in ER calcium signaling was demonstrated for the first time. [Ito et al. (1994)](#) observed exaggerated agonist-evoked calcium release from IP₃ receptor (IP₃R) channels in fibroblasts from AD patients harboring FAD-PS mutations. Guo et al. confirmed those data in neuronal-like cells. They observed remarkably enhanced IP₃R-evoked calcium responses in PC12 cells expressing FAD-PS1 compared to those expressing wild-type PS1 ([Guo et al., 1996](#)). Numerous follow-up studies have confirmed FAD-PS-mediated excessive ER calcium release in other models including Xenopus oocytes ([Leissring et al., 1999](#)), primary neuronal culture ([Chan et al., 2000](#)), acutely dissociated neurons ([Schneider et al., 2001](#)) and brain slices of adult FAD-PS1 mice ([Stutzmann et al., 2004](#)). In addition to the greater magnitude of IP₃R-evoked calcium release, remarkable increase in the percentage of stimuli-responsive cells accompanied expression of FAD-PS1 ([Stutzmann et al., 2004](#)). Using PS-DKO MEF cells (PS1 and PS2 double knock out mouse embryonic fibroblasts) of the same origin, inconsistent results have been obtained describing either attenuated ([Kasri et al., 2006](#)) or amplified ([Tu et al., 2006](#)) calcium release from ER. [Etcheberrigaray et al. (1998)](#) detected an altered IP₃R-mediated calcium release in fibroblasts from a large proportion of AD family members prior to the appearance of overt AD clinical symptoms, but not in family member subjects who failed to develop AD. These data supported the “calcium hypothesis” of AD and led to many follow-up studies which aimed to mechanistically explore the role of FAD-PS mutations in potentiating ER calcium release which will be discussed later. Interestingly, calcium release from Ryanodine receptors (RyR) was also potentiated as a consequence of FAD-PS expression (Fig. 2). In PC12 cells and primary

Fig. 2. Physiological versus pathological FAD-PS-mediated ER calcium homeostasis. Calcium concentration in the ER is approximately 1000 folds higher than cytosol. FAD-PS mutations (lower panel) potentiate the IP₃R- and RyR-induced calcium release, upregulate RyR expression, increase PLC basal activity and IP₃ molecule generation, enhance SERCA pump function and attenuate CCE, as compared to wildtype PS (upper panel). Moreover, PS-FL holoprotein *per se* may function as passive calcium leak channel on the ER membrane, while most FAD-PS mutations lead to the loss of this activity. The direction and the size of the arrows respectively represent the direction and amount of calcium mobilization.
hippocampal neurons, upregulation of RyR expression level and enhanced RyR-evoked calcium release by caffeine was observed (Chan et al., 2000). Likewise, RyR-evoked calcium responses were amplified in slices from young, adult and aged FAD-PS1 knock-in mice, accompanying increased RyR expression (Stutzmann et al., 2006). This effect was most remarkable in dendrites and particularly in dendritic spines, but also detectable in soma and perinuclear regions (Chakroborty et al., 2009). From the earlier studies taken together, the “calcium overload” hypothesis was proposed arguing that the ER calcium overload is the cause of excessive ER calcium release. The interesting finding of the Bezprozvanny group, that PS holoprotein forms passive calcium leak channels on planar lipid bilayers and the leak activity to be impaired by FAD-PS mutations, came in support of the “calcium overload” hypothesis (Fig. 2) (Tu et al., 2006). They argue that RyR upregulation in FAD-PS cells is a neuroprotective compensatory mechanism to normalize the overloaded ER calcium levels (Zhang et al., 2010). They hypothesize that the hydrophilic water-filled catalytic cavity of PS may function as a low conductance calcium-permeable pore (Nelson et al., 2011). They also demonstrated a correlation between the effects of FAD-PS mutations in terms of the leak activity and different AD clinical phenotypes by calcium imaging of patient-derived lymphoblasts (Nelson et al., 2010). However, more recent data have challenged the PS “leak channel” theory (Shilling et al., 2012) and “calcium overload” hypothesis. (Brunello et al., 2009; Cheung et al., 2008). Using several different cell lines and various calcium imaging protocols and indicators, the Foskett team investigated ER calcium filling rates, steady-state ER calcium levels and calcium leak rates from ER. However, they could not provide consistent supporting evidence in favor of “leak channel” hypothesis (Shilling et al., 2012). The results from their study and several other recent works indicate that FAD-PS mutations lead to an unchanged or even attenuated ER calcium level by directly monitoring the absolute calcium content of the ER (Brunello et al., 2009; Cheung et al., 2008; McCombs et al., 2010; Shilling et al., 2012). The FAD-PS mutations do not seem to change the abundance or distribution of IP₃ receptors. However, single IP₃R channel recordings in FAD-patient-derived lymphoblasts and Sf9 cells have revealed that through physical and functional interaction of IP₃R channels with FAD-PS holoprotein, IP₃Rs become more sensitive. The direct consequence of this is the excessive calcium release from ER even under resting conditions and sub-threshold IP₃ molecule levels, i.e. calcium leakage in the absence of muscarinic receptor agonists (Fig. 2) (Cheung et al., 2008). FAD-PS mutations exert their stimulatory effect by enhancing the modal gating activity of IP₃R and shifting the balance toward burst mode with high open-probability and repetitive openings and away from closed-probability mode with only brief openings (Cheung et al., 2010, 2008). Similarly, PS2-NTF facilitates the single channel activity of mouse brain RyR through its direct physical interaction with RyR at the cytosolic side of the ER membrane (Hayrapetyan et al., 2008). This interaction seems to play a role in modulating neurotransmitter release in hippocampus, as it was shown that specific inactivation of PS at presynapses (but not postsynapses) impairs glutamate release, synaptic facilitation and LTP, suggesting a primary role for presynaptic pathomechanisms in AD initiation (Zhang et al., 2009). Intracellular store calcium handling plays a crucial role in synaptic function. Indeed, several genetic and electrophysiological studies have pointed toward the role of PS in synaptic plasticity. Since PS associates with NMDA receptors, PS-DKO mice present lowered synaptic NMDA receptor levels, synaptic and memory deficits as well as neurodegeneration with increasing age (Saura et al., 2004). In young presymptomatic 3xTg-AD mouse model, enhanced calcium release from RyRs accompanies subtle alterations in mechanisms underlying hippocampal synaptic transmission, which are typically masked by compensatory factors in early disease stages and only detectable under RyR

blockade conditions (Chakroborty et al., 2009). Moreover, hippocampal neuronal cultures from PS1 knockout and PS1-M146V mice show disrupted homeostatic synaptic scaling of excitatory synapses, which reflects disturbances in the neuronal ability to tune with changes in the network activity (Pratt et al., 2011). Furthermore, we have demonstrated that PS1 influences the structural plasticity of postsynaptic dendritic spines in the somatosensory cortex (Jung et al., 2011).

FAD-PS mutations have been shown to increase the neuronal vulnerability to Aβ and glutamate through caspase-3 activation as a result of RyR3 isoform upregulation and enhanced RyR-mediated calcium release in PC12 cells (Lee et al., 2006). Notably, the FAD-PS mediated vulnerability and apoptosis can be normalized by pharmacologically or functionally inhibiting the IP₃R-CaMKIV-CREB pathway in SH-SY5Y cells (Muller et al., 2011). In PS-DKO MEFs, the expression of IP₃R was remarkably upregulated (Kasri et al., 2006). Moreover, FAD-PS mutations lead to enhanced basal activity of phospholipase C (PLC) in SH-SY5Y cells, which in turn result in increased production of IP₃ molecule, mediating amplified calcium release from IP₃R channels (Fig. 2) (Cedazo-Minguez et al., 2002). Therefore it is crucial to distinguish the FAD-PS-mediated excessive calcium release as a result of IP₃R/RyR hyperactivity from ER “calcium overload”.

In fibroblasts, the interaction of PS and SERCA2b was demonstrated by their colocalization and coimmunoprecipitation (Green et al., 2008). This interaction is required for the regulation of the SERCA pump activity. The same study shows that Xenopus oocytes harboring FAD-PS1 more effectively sequester calcium from cytosol into the ER than oocytes expressing wildtype PS1 protein (Fig. 2) (Green et al., 2008). In contrast, another study in MEFs and SH-SY5Y cells claims that both wildtype PS2 and FAD-PS2 reduce the SERCA2b activity (Brunello et al., 2009).

Capacitive calcium entry (CCE) is the process of refilling intracellular calcium stores through store-operated calcium channels (SOCC) on the plasma membrane. Calcium imaging in SH-SY5Y cells and primary neurons revealed that CCE is attenuated as a result of FAD-PS mutations and potentiated as a result of PS knockout or deficiency (Fig. 2) (Yoo et al., 2000; Herms et al., 2003). Bojarski et al. found altered expression levels of STIMs, key proteins involved in CCE, in PS-DKO MEFs and patient-derived B-lymphocytes expressing FAD-PS mutations (Bojarski et al., 2009).

As reviewed, the exact mechanism responsible for the FAD-PS mediated amplified ER calcium release is still controversial. However, the consequence of this phenomenon is the elevation of cytosolic calcium concentration and enhanced neuronal vulnerability to stressors. Because calcium itself is the co-agonist of both IP₃R and RyR, the elevated cytosolic calcium concentration in turn initiates a long-term feed-forward mechanism causing a vicious cycle in which the calcium waves and calcium-induced calcium release (CICR) become increasingly exaggerated in space, time, and amplitude.

### 5. PS as a therapeutic target for Alzheimer’s disease treatment

Since PS forms the catalytic component of γ-secretase, inhibition or modulation of its function serves as the prime therapeutic target for AD drug candidates interfering with Aβ generation. However, in view of the unexceptional failures of recent Aβ-focused therapies in clinical trials and the emerging non-proteolytic PS functions, future PS-targeted therapies should not only focus on interfering with γ-secretase proteolytic activity, but rather address the broad spectrum of PS functions, particularly those implicated in the pathogenesis of AD (e.g. disrupted calcium homeostasis).
