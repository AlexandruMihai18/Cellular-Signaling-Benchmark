Human UDP-β-xylose:proteoglycan core protein β-D-xylosyltransferase  
(EC 2.4.2.26, XT-I) initiates the biosynthesis of glycosaminoglycan chains  
in proteoglycans by transferring xylose from UDP-xylose to specific ser-  
ine residues of the core protein. Based on the partial amino acid sequence  
of the purified enzyme from human JAR choriocarcinoma cell culture  
supernatant we isolated a cDNA encoding XT-I using the degenerate  
reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction method. This enzyme,  
which is involved in chondroitin sulfate, heparan sulfate, heparin and  
dermatan sulfate biosynthesis, belongs to a novel family of glycosyltrans-  
ferases with no homology to proteins known so far. 5′ and 3′-RACE were  
performed to isolate a novel cDNA fragment of 3726 bp with a single  
open reading frame encoding at least 827 amino acid residues with a  
molecular mass of 91 kDa. The human XT-I gene was located on chromo-  
some 16p13.1 using radiation hybrid mapping, and extracts from CHO-  
K1 cells transfected with the XT-I cDNA in an expression vector exhib-  
ited marked XT activity. A new 3608 bp cDNA fragment encoding a pro-  
tein of 865 amino acid residues was also isolated by PCR using  
degenerate primers based on the amino acid sequence of human XT-I.  
The amino acid sequence of this XT-II isoform displayed 55% identity to  
the human XT-I. The XT-II gene was located on chromosome 17q21.3-  
17q22, and the exon/intron structure of the 15 kb gene was determined.  
RT-PCR analyses of XT-I and XT-II mRNA from various tissues con-  
firmed that both XT-I and XT-II transcripts are ubiquitously expressed in  
the human tissues, although with different levels of transcription. Fur-  
thermore, the cDNAs encoding XT-I and XT-II from rat were cloned. The  
deduced amino acid sequences of rat xylosyltransferases displayed 94%  
identity to the corresponding human enzyme.

sue. These abundant molecules are present in the

extracellular matrix and on the cell surface, and  
serve a wide range of functions. They are increas-  
ingly implicated as important regulators in many  
biological processes, such as extracellular matrix  
deposition, cell membrane signal transfer, morpho-  
genesis, cell migration, normal and tumor cell  
growth and viral infection (Ruoslahi, 1989; Silbert  
& Sugumaran, 1995; Herold *et al.*, 1994). Proteogly-  
cans mediate diverse cellular processes through  
interaction with a variety of protein ligands. In  
most of these bindings electrostatic interactions  
with the glycosaminoglycan chains attached to the  
core protein are involved (Kjellen & Lindahl, 1991).

Thus, the biological activity of proteoglycans is intimately related to the glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis.

The sulfated glycosaminoglycans chondroitin sulfate, heparan sulfate, heparin and dermatan sulfate are bound to the proteoglycan core protein by a xylose-galactose-galactose binding region (Kjellen & Lindahl, 1991). UDP-D-xylose:proteoglycan core protein β-D-xylosyltransferase (EC 2.4.2.26) is the chain-initiating enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of glycosaminoglycan containing proteoglycans (Schwartz, 1977; Kearms *et al.*, 1991). The enzyme catalyzes the transfer of D-xylose from UDP-D-xylose to specific serine residues of the core protein and is a regulatory factor in chondroitin sulfate biosynthesis (Rodén, 1980). XT activity was found to be present in the cisternae of the rough endoplasmic reticulum of various species (Hoffmann *et al.*, 1984), and we have shown that the enzyme is secreted from the endoplasmic reticulum into the extracellular space together with chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (Kähnert *et al.*, 1991; Götting *et al.*, 1999). However, the processes resulting in the release of XT from the endoplasmic reticulum or the Golgi compartments and the role of XT in the extracellular matrix are not yet known.

As XT is the initial step enzyme in the biosynthesis of the glycosaminoglycan linkage region (Rodén, 1980) and as it is secreted into the extracellular matrix to a great extent, XT activity was proposed to be a diagnostic marker for the determination of an enhanced proteoglycan biosynthesis and of tissue destruction (Weilke *et al.*, 1997). XT activities in the synovial fluid were found to be significantly increased in chronic inflammatory joint diseases (Kleesiek *et al.*, 1987). Our recent studies have shown that serum XT activity is a confirmed biochemical marker for the determination of fibrotic activity in systemic sclerosis (Götting *et al.*, 1999, 2000).

The biosynthesis of glycosaminoglycans requires the coordinated action of a large number of glycosyltransferases. Isolation and cloning of these glycosyltransferases has been targeted for a long time, since the majority of these enzymes are only present in minute amounts. The structure and sequence of the glycosyltransferases involved in biosynthesis of the common glycosaminoglycan-protein linkage region has long been unknown. Recent cDNA cloning of galactosyltransferase I (Okajima *et al.*, 1999b) and glucuronyltransferase I (Kitagawa *et al.*, 1998) identified two of the at least four enzymes involved in synthesis of the GlcAβ1-3Galβ1-3Galβ1-4Xylβ1-O-Ser structure.

Purification and characterization of the initial enzyme involved in biosynthesis of the common carbohydrate-protein linkage structure has been hampered by difficulties in obtaining a sufficient amount of the source material. Therefore, we developed a novel method to produce a protein solution with high XT activity but low protein concentration by serum-free cultivation of JAR chorio-

carcinoma cells using hollow fiber bioreactor technology (Kuhn *et al.*, 2000). Using this material we successfully purified the XT to homogeneity and determined the partial amino acid sequence of the proteolytically cleaved protein.

We have now cloned a cDNA encoding the XT-I and identified a first isoform of the XT-I. This is the first report on gene cloning of a mammalian xylosyltransferase.

## Results

### Isolation of human xylosyltransferase from JAR choriocarcinoma cells

Human XT was isolated from the cell culture supernatant of JAR choriocarcinoma cells as described in detail elsewhere (Kuhn *et al.*, 2000). Briefly, JAR choriocarcinoma cells were cultivated under serum-free conditions using hollow fiber bioreactor technology to produce culture medium with high XT activity. Using 18.5 l of this material, which is equivalent to 2000 l of normal cell culture supernatant, we successfully isolated the XT in trace amounts with a combination of different chromatographic steps. The unknown protein with a molecular mass of 120 kDa was enzymatically digested and a partial amino acid sequence was determined by Edman degradation and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry-time of flight analysis (MALDI-TOF).

### PCR-based cloning of human XT-I cDNA

Based upon the amino acid sequence of four peptides, degenerate primers were designed for cloning the XT-I cDNA (Figure 1). When primers SPPS1 and Lysc-inv were used in a PCR with the first strand cDNA of SW1353 chondrosarcoma poly(A)+ mRNA as template, a major band of approximately 690 bp was observed (data not shown). After subcloning and sequencing, a previously unknown DNA sequence was obtained from clone pCG114-29. PCR amplification with the primers DF1 and a mixture of Inv2b and Inv2c resulted in a 1724 bp fragment, which was subcloned and sequenced. The deduced amino acid sequence of the clone pCG111-4 was identical to six of the sequenced peptides from human XT-I. The cloning strategy of rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) (Chenchik *et al.*, 1996) was employed to clone the complete coding sequence of the XT-I cDNA. The largest DNA fragment obtained from the 3′-RACE reaction was 1.6 kb and consisted of a 3′-untranslated region of 1240 bp. The 5′-RACE reaction was performed with different primers derived from the nucleotide sequence of XT-I cDNA, but the 5′-untranslated region of human XT-I cDNA could not be cloned using this method. All DNA fragments obtained contained just the known cDNA sequence and an additional 80 bp of coding sequence.

Figure 1. Cloning strategy for human XT-I and XT-II isoform. (a) The peptides 4, 6, 7, and 9 are sequences that were most favorable for the design of degenerate PCR primers. The amino acid sequence of the peptides was obtained after proteolytic digestion of the purified human XT (Kuhn et al., 2000). The strategy for cloning of XT-I cDNA (b) and XT-II isoform (c) is illustrated. The open reading frame of XT-I and XT-II is shown as a filled box, and the location of the peptides 4, 6, 7, and 9 is illustrated by open boxes. The location and orientation of the degenerate primers employed for cloning of XT-I and XT-II are marked by arrows. XT-I and XT-II cDNA inserts contained within the indicated plasmids were obtained using RT-PCR with degenerate primers (pCG111-4, pCG114-29, pCG110-7), 5' RACE (pCG185-21, pCG212-19, pCG319-23, 3' RACE (pCG204-38, pCG211-4) and RT-PCR with gene-specific primers (pCG176-1). H = A + C + T, Y = C + T, R = A + G, N = A + G + C + T, I = deoxyinosine.

Thus, a PCR-based screening approach using cDNA libraries as template was employed for cloning of the 5'-untranslated region. All DNA fragments obtained from the screening of three different human cDNA libraries stopped at the same nucleotide, indicating that stable secondary structures of the XT-I mRNA prevent the synthesis of cDNA of the 5'-untranslated region during the reverse transcription reaction. However, the translation initiation codon of human XT-I has not yet been cloned. The combined cDNA of human XT-I contained 3726 bp with a single open reading frame encoding at least 827 residues with a molecular mass of at least 91 kDa. The deduced amino acid sequence contained three potential N-glycosylation sites (Figure 2). Analysis of the amino acid sequence using the hydrophobic cluster analysis (Gaboriaud et al., 1987) revealed the presence of a common DxD motif at position 183, which has been shown to be essential for binding nucleotide sugars in glycosyltransferases (Busch et al., 1998; Breton & Imberty, 1999).

### PCR-based cloning of human XT-II isoform cDNA

The degenerate primers PFF-sense and Lysc-inv1, which were designed when the amino acid sequence of proteolytic-cleaved peptides of human XT-I were used in a PCR reaction with first strand cDNA of placenta poly(A)+ mRNA as template. The PCR amplification resulted in a minor band of

Figure 2. Nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence of the human XT-I. The predicted amino acid sequence is indicated by the single letter amino acid code below the nucleotide sequence. The position of the peptide sequences obtained by digestion of the purified human XT (Kuhn et al., 2000) are underlined. Asterisks indicate potential N-glycosylation sites. The DxD motif (double underlined), which was recently shown to be involved in the binding of nucleotide sugars (Busch et al., 1998), was identified by hydrophobic cluster analysis (Breton & Imbert, 1999). As the translation initiation codon has not been yet cloned, the deduced amino acids are numbered starting with the first known amino acid.

1.1 kb, which was cloned and sequenced. The determined nucleotide sequence was similar but not identical to the XT-I cDNA sequence, indicating that the fragment encodes a XT-II isoform. To clone the complete coding sequence of the novel cDNA, the RACE strategy was employed. The cDNA finally obtained was 3608bp (Figure 3) and contained a single open reading frame encoding a protein of 865 residues with a molecular mass of 97kDa. The 3'-untranslated region is 850bp and a 5'-untranslated region of 149bp was identified with an in-frame stop codon upstream of the ATG codon. A Kyte-Doolittle hydropathy analysis (Kyte & Doolittle, 1982) of the deduced amino acid sequence revealed one potential membrane-spanning region consisting of 16 hydrophobic amino acid residues at position 16 to 32, which appears to result in a type II transmembrane orientation characteristic of many of the glycosyltransferases. The predicted amino acid sequence contains a proline-rich profile pattern from position 110 to 118 and three potential N-glycosylation sites (Figure 3). The human XT-II isoform protein exhibits 55% overall sequence identity to the human XT-I (Figure 4), including stretches in the XT-II protein with more than 80% homology to the human XT-I.

Cloning of rat XT-I and XT-II cDNA

For amplification of the XT-I and XT-II cDNA from rat tissue, gene-specific primers were designed based upon the nucleotide sequence of human XT-I and XT-II cDNA. These oligonucleotides were employed in PCR, 5'-RACE and 3'-RACE reactions with rat liver cDNA as template and a 2593 bp cDNA fragment coding for rat XT-I was obtained. 5'-RACE reactions using a diversity of gene-specific primers were performed for identification of the 5'-end of the XT-I cDNA. All cDNA fragments obtained stopped at exactly the same nucleotide position as observed in the human XT-I cDNA, indicating that stable secondary structures of the XT-I mRNA inhibit cDNA synthesis of the 5'-region. The XT-II cDNA fragment finally obtained after PCR amplification with rat liver

cDNA was 2782 bp and included the entire coding region of rat XT-II. The deduced amino acid sequences of XT-I and XT-II from rat each displayed 94% identity to the corresponding human xylosyltransferase. Alignment of all amino acid sequences revealed the presence of highly conserved amino acid clusters in the central and carboxyterminal regions of the proteins (Figure 4).

Identification of the chromosomal localization of the human XT-I and XT-II genes

The gene coding for human XT-I could be assigned to the short arm of chromosome 16 at the region 16p13.1. The radiation hybrid mapping using the Genebridge 4 radiation hybrid screening panel located the position of the PCR fragment 5.98 cR distal to the STS marker

CHLC.GATA42E11 and 4.40 cR proximal to marker D16S499. The XT-II gene was identified on chromosome 17 at the position 17q21.3-17q22 and was found to be located distal to the STS marker WI-11424 and proximal to the marker WI-14315.

Genomic exon/intron organization of the human XT-II isoform gene

Searching the Genbank database using the nucleotide sequence of the XT-II isoform identified the human PAC-clone hRPC.117_B_12 (Genbank accession no. AC004707) which contained a 123 kb insert from chromosome 17. No coding region had yet been predicted for that genomic clone. Comparison of the cDNA sequence of XT-II isoform with the nucleotide sequence of the identified clone showed that it contains the complete XT-II gene. As summarized in Figure 5, the human XT-II isoform gene spans 15 kb and consists of 11 exons ranging from 81 bp to more than 1 kb. The nucleotide sequences of the exons were found to be completely identical to those of the cloned XT-II cDNA. The intron/exon junctions were found to follow the GT/AG rule and were mainly flanked by the conserved sequences (Breathnach & Chambon, 1981).

Closed boxes represent the coding sequences and grey shaded boxes the 5'- and 3'-untranslated sequences. The translation initiation codon (ATG) and the termination codon (Stop) are marked by arrows. Black horizontal bars denote the introns.

Expression of recombinant XT

To prove the function of the cDNA product, a recombinant form of XT-I was generated by fusing the cloned XT-I to an aminoterminal peptide tag. The fused protein was expressed in CHO-K1 cells and absorbed from the medium by immunoprecipitation with anti-Xpress-antibodies and protein G agarose beads to eliminate endogenous XT activity. The enzyme-bound beads were used as an enzyme source and assayed for XT activity as shown in Table 1. No detectable XT activity was recovered by the affinity purification from a control transfection sample. The substrate specificity of the recombinant XT-I was similar to that of the XT-I isolated from human body fluids and cell culture supernatants (Brinkmann et al., 1997; Weilke et al., 1997; Götting et al., 1999). The recovered enzyme activity of the recombinantly expressed XT-I could be completely inhibited by addition of 250 U of heparin. As specific inhibition of human XT activity by heparin has been demonstrated previously (Kleesiek et al., 1987), these results clearly indicate that the expressed protein is the human XT. However, no enzymatic transfer of xylose to the acceptor peptides used in this study was observed when expressing XT-II fused to the aminoterminal peptide tag in CHO-K1 cells.

To identify the XT-I reaction products, the bikunin peptide was labeled with \[^{14}C\]-D-xylose using the XT-I-bound beads as an enzyme source. The products were subsequently subjected to the linkage-specific digestion of the bound \[^{14}C\]-D-xylose with α and β-xylosidase and alkaline β-elimination. Incubation of the reaction products with β-xylosidase resulted in the release of 74% of the incorporated \[^{14}C\]xylose, whereas only less than 4% of the peptide-bound xylose was digested after treatment with α-xylosidase. The alkaline cleavage of the O-glycosidic linkage between the xylose and the β-hydroxyamino acid serine in the presence of borohydride lead to the liberation of more than 97% of the enzymatically transferred \[^{14}C\]xylose. In all the experiments performed no significant amount of \[^{14}C\]-D-xylose was incorporated without the addition of the bikunin peptide as acceptor. These results clearly indicate that a xylose residue was transferred to the hydroxyamino acid serine of the bikunin peptide through a β-linkage. In conclusion the expressed protein was identified as UDP-D-xylose:proteoglycan core protein β-D-xylosyltransferase (EC 2.4.2.26).

Tissue-specific expression of XT-I and the XT-II isoform

The expression of XT-I and XT-II isoform gene was examined in various human tissues using a RT-PCR-based method with normalized first-strand cDNA. Each PCR yielded a single product with predicted nucleotide lengths of 490 bp for XT-I and 717 bp for XT-II, although the amount of the amplified product varied (Figure 6). Amplification of XT-I and XT-II fragments resulted in a product visible by ethidium bromide staining after 36 cycles, whereas the DNA fragment corresponding to the abundant glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase transcript was visible after 20 cycles. This finding indicates that XT-I and XT-II are expressed at very low levels. The greatest abundance of XT-I expression was detected in the placenta, kidney and pancreas and only a very weak expression was detected in skeletal muscle. The greatest abundance of XT-II isoform is expressed in the kidney and pancreas.

XT activity of the enzyme fractions using different acceptors and the inhibition of enzyme activity by addition of heparin is shown. The synthetic bikunin, L-APP and L-APLP2 homologous peptides have been previously proved to be good acceptors for XT mediated xylosylation (Brinkmann et al., 1997; Götting et al., 1998). No XT activity was detected in samples from mock-transfected cells after affinity purification. n.d., not detected (detection limit, 20 μU/l).

Molecular Cloning and Expression of XT-I and XT-II

**Figure 6.** Differential expression of the XT-I and the XT-II gene in human tissues. Semiquantitative RT-PCR with normalized first-strand cDNA was used to examine the abundance of XT-I and XT-II transcripts. A 983 bp fragment of the housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA was amplified as control. (a) The 490 bp XT-I cDNA fragment (b) and the 717 bp fragment amplified from XT-II isoform cDNA (c) were detected in each tissue indicating that both enzymes are ubiquitously expressed. The arrows indicate the expected position for each PCR product.

**Cellular distribution of XT activity in cultured CHO-K1 cells**

After an incubation period of three days, cultured CHO-K1 cells were harvested and the XT activity was determined in the spent culture supernatant and the cell lysates. 92% of the total XT activity was found to be located in the cell culture medium (93.1 mU/10<sup>6</sup> cells, SD 9.58), whereas only 2% was detected in the cell lysates (2.03 mU/10<sup>6</sup> cells, SD 0.44). Some 6% of the total XT activity (5.82 mU/10<sup>6</sup> cells, SD 2.18) was released from the membrane-containing fractions after addition of the detergent Triton X-100, indicating that less than one-tenth of XT is bound to cellular membranes. These results are in accordance with the compartmental distribution of XT activity in JAR choriocarcinoma cells (unpublished observations).

**Discussion**

In the present study we have cloned the UDP-D-xylose:proteoglycan core protein β-D-xylosyltransferase, which is the initial enzyme involved in biosynthesis of the common carbohydrate-protein linkage structure of chondroitin sulfate, heparan sulfate and dermatan sulfate proteoglycans. Based on the amino acid sequence of the previously isolated enzyme (Kuhn et al., 2000) a novel cDNA was cloned, which encodes a protein of at least 827 residues with a molecular mass of 91 kDa. A DxD motif was identified in the XT-I amino acid sequence using hydrophobic cluster analysis. This motif has been observed in many glycosyltransferases, and is involved in the coordination of a divalent cation in the binding of the nucleotide-sugar (Busch et al., 1998; Breton & Imberty, 1999).

The majority of eukaryotic glycosyltransferase enzymes shares a common domain structure and is located in the Golgi apparatus (Paulson & Colley, 1989). Most of them are type II transmembrane proteins with a lumenally oriented C terminus with the catalytic domain, a single membrane-spanning region and a cytoplasmic N terminus (Jozaisse, 1992). However, bacterial glycosyltransferases exhibit various topologies with either multiple transmembrane domains or binding to membranes, even though no transmembrane domains were found (Liu et al., 1993). Several investigations suggest that soluble glycosyltransferases were formed from membrane-bound enzymes by proteolytic cleavage between the catalytic domain and the transmembrane domain (Paulson et al., 1987; Lammers & Jamieson, 1989). Human XT-I seems to differ from the other mammalian glycosyltransferases: (1) it is mainly secreted into the extracellular matrix (Götting et al., 1999), whereas the other glycosyltransferases are mostly retained in the Golgi apparatus; (2) a comparison of the molecular mass of the isolated XT with other glycosyltransferases shows that the XT is larger than most other enzymes, which have a molecular mass of 40 to 70 kDa. These findings suggest that the human XT possesses further regulatory functions in glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis. Xylosylation of the specific serine residues in the core protein takes place in the pre-Golgi compartment (Kearns et al., 1991, Kearns et al., 1993). Whereas only less than one-tenth of the XT is bound to cellular membranes, the majority of XT is found to be secreted into the extracellular matrix together with proteoglycans (Kähnert et al., 1991; Götting et al., 1999). The biochemical mechanisms of this secretion process and the biological role of XT in the extracellular matrix are not yet understood and have to be elucidated in detail in further studies.

The translation initiation codon of the XT-I cDNA could not be yet cloned, probably due to strong secondary structures in the 5′-region of the XT-I mRNA. Therefore, further efforts will be made to identify a genomic clone harboring the XT-I gene. The XT-I protein isolated from JAR choriocarcinoma cell culture supernatant migrated on SDS-PAGE with a molecular mass of 120 kDa and the protein size could be further reduced after N-glycanase F digestion (Kuhn et al., 2000). These findings indicate that the cloned cDNA represents at least 90% of the coding region of human XT-I.

Another cDNA was completely identified from human placenta RNA, which was similar but not identical to the XT-I cDNA. The new cDNA encodes a protein of 865 residues with a molecular mass of 97 kDa. This novel protein termed XT-II has a proline-rich region located near the amino-terminus and the type II transmembrane topology, characteristic of many other glycosyltransferases cloned to date. The human XT-II protein was

similar to the human XT-I with an overall sequence identity of 55%. The similarity of the predicted amino acid sequences was low (<10%) at the amino-terminal end. However, large stretches at the C-terminal region, where the catalytic domain was found to be located in glycosyltransferases (Field & Wainwright, 1995), are very conserved with an identity of more than 80% in both proteins. These findings let us conclude that the XT-II gene encodes another human xylosyltransferase, although the catalytic activity and the biological role of XT-II remain to be elucidated in detail.

Mutations in genes encoding glycosyltransferases involved in biosynthesis of the glycosaminoglycan have been demonstrated to result in severe disturbance of metabolism. The progeroid variant of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome has been reported to be caused by defects in galactosyltransferase I (Okajima et al., 1999a), whereas mutations in the EXT and EXT-like tumor-suppressor genes are responsible for hereditary multiple exostosis, the most frequent of all skeletal dysplasias (Wise et al., 1997). The EXTL2 gene has recently been identified as the α1,4-N-acetylhexosaminyltransferase, which transfers N-acetylgalactosamine and N-acetylglucosamine to the glycosaminoglycan-protein linkage region (Kitagawa et al., 1999). It has also been shown that the EXT1 and EXT2 gene products harbor glucuronyl and N-acetyl-glucosaminyltransferase activities required for heparan sulfate synthesis (Lind et al., 1998).

Further analysis will have to be performed to elucidate the role of the XT as the initial enzyme in chondroitin sulfate and heparan sulfate biosynthesis in such diseases.

The cloning of the XT-I cDNA and chromosomal mapping of the corresponding gene are important steps in clarifying the importance of the XT in severe disorders of the connective tissue. Since alterations in XT activity have been reported to be associated with fibrotic and sclerotic alterations of connective tissue (Götting et al., 1999, 2000), the present findings provide molecular tools to study the function and the regulated expression of human XT as well as the molecular mechanisms of these diseases.

### Materials and Methods

#### Cell culture

CHO-K1 cells (DSMZ, Braunschweig, Germany) were grown in Ham’s F12 growth medium supplemented with 10% FCS using standard procedures (Butler & Dawson, 1992). JAR choriocarcinoma cells (ATCC, Rockville, MD, USA) were cultured in serum-free and protein-free Ultradoma-PF medium in hybrid hollow-fiber bioreactors as described elsewhere (Kuhn et al., 2000).

#### Preparation of cell lysates

Cells were mechanically lysed as previously described (Götting et al., 1999). For determination of membrane-bound enzyme activity the lysed cells were incubated with PBS with 1% Triton X-100 for five minutes and shaken on a vortex mixer for two minutes.

#### Determination of xylosyltransferase activity

The method for determination of XT activity is based on the incorporation of \[^{14}C\]-D-xylose with recombinant bikunin as acceptor and is published elsewhere in detail (Weilke et al., 1997; Brinkmann et al., 1997). For analysis of the substrate specificity of the recombinant xylosyltransferases synthetic peptides containing the XT recognition sequence were used as acceptor. The reaction mixture for the assay contained, in a total volume of 100 μl: 50 μl of XT solution, 25 mM 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid (pH 6.5), 25 mM KCl, 5 mM KF, 5 mM MgCl₂, 5 mM MnCl₂, 1.0 μM UDP-\[^{14}C\]-D-xylose, and 1.5 μM of the synthetic peptides. After incubation for 75 minutes at \(37^\circ\)C, the reaction mixtures were placed on discs (25 mm diameter) of Immobilon-AV membrane, which immobilizes even small peptides by covalent links (Pfund & Bourdage, 1990), and allowed to dry. It was then washed for ten minutes with 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid and three times with 5% trichloroacetic acid solution. Incorporated radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting.

#### PCR-based cloning of human xylosyltransferase

Degenerate oligonucleotide primers with deoxyinosine substitution were designed based upon the amino acid sequence of peptides obtained after digestion of the isolated human XT with trypsin or Lys-C (Kuhn et al., 2000). The first strand of cDNA was synthesized by the reverse transcription reaction using poly(A)+ RNA isolated from the chondrosarcoma cell line SW1353 as template and oligo(dT) as primer. The reverse transcription reaction was performed at \(37^\circ\)C for two hours using 50 pmol of oligo(dT) primers, 1 μg of poly(A)+ RNA, a 0.5 mM concentration of each dNTP, 1 × RT buffer and 200 units of RNase H deficient Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Eggenstein, Germany) in a final volume of 20 μl. For PCR amplification the reaction mixture contained 4 μl of the reverse transcription reaction solution, 50 pmol of each primer, a 0.25 mM concentration of each dNTP, 50 mM KCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 1.5 mM MgCl₂ and 2.5 units of hot start Taq polymerase (Life Technologies) in a final volume of 50 μl. Amplification with degenerate oligonucleotide primers was carried out by 40 cycles at \(94^\circ\)C for one minute, \(48^\circ\)C for one minute, and \(72^\circ\)C for two minutes, followed by a final extension step at \(72^\circ\)C for 15 minutes. After agarose electrophoresis of the PCR products, DNA fragments were excised, subcloned into the pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen, Groningen, Netherlands) and sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method using Taq DNA polymerase (Big-dye terminator cycle sequencing kit, Perkin-Elmer, Norwalk, CT, USA) with an automated DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Weiterstadt, Germany). Several clones were sequenced to compensate for misreading by Taq polymerase.

#### Rapid amplification of 5′ and 3′-cDNA ends (RACE)

For amplification of the 5′ and 3′-ends of the XT-I and XT-II isoform cDNA RACE experiments were performed using commercially available systems (Clontech,

Heidelberg, Germany; Life Technologies) according to the manufacturers' instructions. For 3'-RACE 1 μg placenta poly(A)+ mRNA (Clontech) was reverse transcribed with a 3'-CDS primer (Clontech). PCR amplification of the 3'-cDNA end of human XT-I was accomplished according to a touch-down PCR protocol (five cycles: 94°C for 30 seconds, 72°C for three minutes, five cycles: 94°C for 30 seconds, 70°C for 45 seconds, 72°C for three minutes, 25 cycles: 94°C for 30 seconds, 65°C for 45 seconds, 72°C for three minutes) with the gene-specific primer GSP1b 5'-GTGGGATAGCA-GAAGTGGGGGAAGGGAC-3' and the UPM primer mix (Clontech). An aliquot of the first PCR was subjected to semi-nested PCR (30 cycles) using the primer Con2111 5'-CCCTCCGCAATGCCTACA-3' and the UPM primer mix. The DNA fragments obtained were subcloned into the vector pCR2.1 (Invitrogen) and sequenced. PCR amplification of the 3'-cDNA end of the XT-II isoform was carried out with the primers AB10267 5'-ACT-GAGGTCACGCAATACAA-3' and UPM using the touch-down PCR protocol. For 5'-RACE 1 μg of placenta poly(A)+ mRNA was subjected to a reverse transcription and 5'-tailing reaction with the 5'-CDS primer and the SMART oligo (Clontech) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The 5'-end of the XT-I cDNA was amplified using the primer GSP_776L 5'-GCCGCACCTCAGGTT-GATGAAGAAGT-3' and UPM with a touch-down PCR protocol. An aliquot was used as template in a second semi-nested PCR reaction with the primers GSP_503L 5'-ACCACCAGGACAAAAGGCGATTCTGA-3' and UPM. The 5'-cDNA end of XT-II was obtained by 5'-RACE amplification using the primers AB10315L 5'-AGTC-GAACAGTCCAGGGCCC-3' and UPM mix. A new primer for a 5'-RACE reaction was designed based upon the nucleotide sequence of the largest fragment obtained (2 kbp), and the experiment was repeated with the primer AB5846L 5'-CACGATCTCGCACTTGGGGG-3' as described above. The nucleotide sequences of human XT-I and XT-II cDNA have been submitted to the GenBank/EBI Data Bank with the accession numbers AJ277441 and AJ277442.

**Isolation of XT-I cDNA from human brain and chondrocyte cDNA libraries**

Plasmid-DNA was isolated from a human whole brain cDNA library (Life Technologies) and a human chondrocyte cDNA library (Clontech) and used as template in a PCR-based approach for isolation of the 5'-end of the XT-I cDNA. Briefly, GSP_776L and 5'ADLD 5'-CTATTCGATGATGAAGATACCCCACCAAACCC-3' primers were used in a PCR reaction with 1 μg of plasmid DNA as template. The DNA fragments were subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis and 0.7-3 kb long fragments were excised from the gel and used as a template in a semi-nested PCR reaction with GSP_503L and 5'-ADLD primers. DNA fragments were then subcloned into the vector pCR2.1 and sequenced.

**Cloning of rat XT-I and XT-II cDNA**

A RT-PCR based approach using primers based upon the nucleotide sequence of human XT-I and XT-II was employed for amplification of XT-I and XT-II cDNA from rat. The first strand of cDNA was synthesized by the reverse transcription reaction using poly(A)+ RNA isolated from the rat liver cell line BRL3A as template and oligo(dT) as primer. DNA fragments obtained after

PCR amplification using moderate stringent conditions were subcloned into the vector pCR2.1 and sequenced. The 5' and 3'-ends of the XT-I and XT-II cDNA from rat tissue were amplified using the RACE strategy with gene-specific primers as described above. The nucleotide sequences of rat XT-I and XT-II cDNA have been submitted to the GenBank/EBI Data Bank with the accession numbers AJ295748 and AJ295749.

**Expression levels of the XT-I and the XT-II isoform in human tissues**

A Human Multiple Tissue cDNA Panel (Clontech) was used for the analysis of expression levels. Levels of amplification of the housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, whose transcript is always present in the tissues at an almost constant level, were determined in parallel for quality control. For amplification of the XT-I encoding transcript the primers 128U and 601L were used, whereas primers AB10267U and AB12394L 5'-GGAAGAGCCTGGGTGTGGAAT-3' were employed for the XT-II. PCR reactions were carried out by 22-36 cycles at 94°C for 30 seconds, 60-65°C for 45 seconds and 72°C for two minutes. Amplification of a transcript was performed using a serial number of cycles to find the conditions for semiquantitative amplification, and aliquots were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis.

**Chromosomal localization of the XT-I and XT-II genes**

The chromosomal localization of the XT-I gene and the XT-II gene was determined by radiation hybrid mapping. For each mapping 93 PCR reactions were performed on the Genebridge 4 radiation hybrid screening panel (Research Genetics, Groningen, Netherlands) and the obtained data was analyzed relative to the radiation hybrid map of the human genome. For radiation hybrid mapping of the XT-I gene PCR amplification was carried out using the primers XT2444U 5'-CGGGAAAGCAGC-CAGAG-3' and XT2688L 5'-GGTCAGGGGGTGGGTCACT-3'. For chromosomal mapping of the XT-II gene the primers AB6333U 5'-CATGGACCCCCCGGTGC-3' and AB6392L 5'-GAGGAGACGCTTCAGCTGG-3' were used.

**Transfection and transient expression of XT**

For construction of a eukaryotic expression vector a DNA fragment including the known coding sequence of XT-I cDNA was amplified by PCR using XT_Exp1L 5'-TTTCCCGTTGAGATCCTGCT-3' and XT_Exp3U 5'-ACAGACAGCAACAACGAGAA-3' as primers and placenta first-strand cDNA (Clontech) as template. The 2450 bp fragment obtained was cloned into the vector pcDNA4/HisMax-TOPO (Invitrogen) resulting in the fusion of XT-I to the Xpress epitope. The plasmid pCG227-XT-I was then transiently transfected into CHO-K1 cells. The coding region of the XT-II cDNA was amplified by PCR using the primers AB_Exp9U 5'-AAAGGAAGGCAGAGGAAGC-3' and AB_Exp3L 5'-ACCCCTCCACTGTCTGTAAG-3' and placenta first-strand cDNA as template. The obtained 2440 bp DNA fragment was cloned into the expression vector pcDNA4/HisMax-TOPO resulting in the fusion of XT-II to the aminoterminal Xpress epitope. The plasmid termed pCG226-XT-II was transiently transfected into CHO-K1

cells. $2 \times 10^{5}$ cells precultured for one day in a 35 mm diameter cell culture dish were transfected with 2 μg of plasmid DNA and 6 μl of Fugene 6 transfection reagent (Roche, Mannheim, Germany). For determination of transfection efficiency CHO-K1 cells were transfected with 2 μg of the control plasmid pcDNA4/HisMax-TOPO-lacZ. Forty-eight hours after transfection, the cell culture medium was harvested. Protein G agarose beads (Sigma, Deisenhofen, Germany) and mouse anti-Xpress monoclonal antibody (Invitrogen) were added to the cell culture supernatant and incubated at 4°C for one hour. After centrifugation at 10,000 g for one minute the absorbed proteins were twice washed with PBS and resuspended in a final volume of 50 μl. XT activity was then assayed in the samples.

### Characterization of the reaction products

For characterization of the reaction product of recombinant XT-I the peptide QEEEQSGGGQK, which is homologous to the amino terminus of bikunin (Brinkmann *et al.*, 1997), was used as acceptor in the XT activity assay. After incubation for 75 minutes at 37°C the enzyme was heat-inactivated by incubation for 15 minutes at 65°C and the reaction mixture was used for α and β-xylosidase treatment and alkaline β-elimination.

For the linkage-specific digestion of the bound [14C]-D-xylose 4 mU of α-xylosidase (Seikagaku Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) or 4 mU of β-xylosidase (Sigma, Dreieich, Germany) were added to the samples and incubated for 60 minutes at 37°C. The reaction mixtures were then placed on Immobilin-AV membrane discs and allowed to dry. The discs were washed with trichloroacetic acid as described above and the remaining incorporated radioactivity was determined against appropriate controls.

The alkaline cleavage of the O-glycosidic linkage between the [14C]-D-xylose and the β-hydroxyamino acid serine was performed as described elsewhere (Montreuil *et al.*, 1994). Briefly, the reaction mixture was adjusted to pH 10 with diluted NaOH and an equal volume of cold, freshly prepared sodiumborohydride solution (2 M sodiumborohydride in 0.1 M NaOH) and was added. After incubation at 45°C for 16 hours the cooled solution was neutralized by adding 50% (w/w) acetic acid and placed on Immobilin-AV membrane discs. After drying the discs were washed with trichloroacetic acid and the remaining radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting.
