**Summary**

While $N$-glycan synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is relatively well conserved in eukaryotes, $N$-glycan processing and $O$-glycan biosynthesis in the Golgi apparatus are kingdom specific and result in different oligosaccharide structures attached to glycoproteins in plants and mammals. With the prospect of using plants as alternative hosts to mammalian cell lines for the production of therapeutic glycoproteins, significant progress has been made towards the humanization of protein $N$-glycosylation in plant cells. To date, successful efforts in this direction have mainly focused on the targeted expression of therapeutic proteins, the knockout of plant-specific $N$-glycan-processing genes, and/or the introduction of the enzymatic machinery catalyzing the synthesis, transport and addition of human sugars. By contrast, very little attention has been paid until now to the $O$-glycosylation status of plant-made therapeutic proteins, which is surprising considering that hundreds of human proteins represent good candidates for Hyp-$O$ glycosylation when produced in a plant expression system. This review describes protein $N$- and $O$-linked glycosylation in plants and highlights the limitations and advantages of plant-specific glycosylation on plant-made biopharmaceuticals.

**Introduction**

According to the Swiss-Prot database, more than 50% of the proteins in eukaryotes (Apweiler et al., 1999), as well as one-third of approved biopharmaceuticals (Walsh and Jefferis, 2006), are glycoproteins. Carbohydrates attached to proteins can be classified into two main categories: $N$-glycans, linked to the amide group of asparagine (Asn) residues; and $O$-glycans, linked to the hydroxyl group of serine (Ser), threonine (Thr), hydroxylysine or hydroxyproline (Hyp) residues in the protein chain. With the exception of nucleocytoplasmic $O$-GlcNAcylation, protein $N$- and $O$-glycosylations typically occur in the secretory pathway. $N$-glycosylation starts in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), with the cotranslational or post-translational transfer of a preformed lipid-linked oligosaccharide onto the nascent polypeptide. In contrast, $O$-glycans are synthesized by a stepwise transfer of monosaccharides on the folded protein in the ER and the Golgi apparatus (GA).

The biological activity of many therapeutic glycoproteins – notably antibodies, blood factors and interferons – is dependent on their glycosylation status, which contributes to explain why biopharmaceuticals are often produced in heterologous expression systems with glycosylation capabilities. The absolute requirement of several proteins for $N$-glycosylation also supports the use of transgenic plants over classical production systems such as *Escherichia coli* or yeast, owing to their ability to perform complex $N$-glycosylation processes required to ensure effective bioactivity and pharmacokinetics of recombinant proteins in a therapeutic context. Unfortunately, and as for any other eukaryotic expression system, plants are unable to exactly
reproduce human-type glycosylation patterns on biopharmaceuticals (Gomord and Faye, 2004; Faye et al., 2005), and plant-specific glycosylation is considered at this stage as a major limitation for the use of plant-made pharmaceuticals (PMP) in human therapy. Our goal, in this review, is to highlight recent progress towards the humanization of N-glycosylation in plants and to illustrate that plant-specific N- and O-glycosylations in fact emerge progressively as possible positive arguments for using plants as expression systems for human therapeutic proteins.

### N-glycan biosynthesis is similar in plants and mammals

In plant cells, as in other eukaryotic cells, protein N-glycosylation starts in the ER by the co- or post-translational transfer of an oligosaccharide precursor, Glc₃Man₉GlcNAc₂, from a dolichol lipid carrier onto specific Asn residues constitutive of the N-glycosylation consensus sequence Asn–X–Ser/Thr (where X is any amino acid except Pro). Once transferred onto the nascent protein and while the glycoprotein is transported along the secretory pathway, the oligosaccharide N-linked to Asn, or N-glycan, undergoes several maturation steps involving the removal of glucose (Glc) and mannose (Man) residues to generate high-Man-type N-glycans and, eventually, the addition of new sugar residues in the ER and the GA to build up complex-type N-glycans (Figure 1).

Whereas high-Man-type N-glycans contain five to nine Man residues and have the same structure in plant and mammalian glycoproteins, plant complex-type N-glycans are structurally different from their mammalian counterparts.

**Figure 1** Reference pathway for protein N-glycosylation in plants. Assembly of the lipid-linked oligosaccharide precursor begins on the cytoplasmic side of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. The resulting Man₅GlcNAc₂-PP-Dol then flips into the ER lumen, where four further Man residues and three glucose residues are added to produce the complete Glc₃Man₉GlcNAc₂-PP-Dol. After transfer of the oligosaccharide precursor from the lipid carrier onto the nascent protein by the action of the multienzyme oligosaccharyltransferase complex, the newly formed N-glycoprotein enters the calnexin-calreticulin (CNX–CRT) cycle. The alternate action of glucosidase II and UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase drives the glycoprotein through this cycle until it is correctly folded and exported from the ER to the Golgi apparatus (GA). Terminally, misfolded proteins are retro-translocated from the ER to the cytosol by the ER-associated degradation machinery for proteasomal degradation. Most host-specific maturations occur on the N-glycan when the glycoprotein is transported through the GA. Major glycan-processing steps leading to the biosynthesis of high-mannose-, complex-, hybrid-, and paucimannose-type N-glycans in plant cells are illustrated here. See Table S1 for enzyme definitions.

counterparts (Figure 2). For instance, β-mannose of the glycan core in plants is substituted by a bisecting β1,2 xylose never found in mammalian N-glycans, while the proximal N-acetylglucosamine of the core is substituted by an α1,3 fucose, instead of the α1,6-fucose found in mammals. In addition, β1,3 galactose and fucose α1,4 linked to the terminal GlcNAc of plant N-glycans form the so-called Lewis a (Le<sup>a</sup>) oligosaccharide structure, while a β1,4 galactose residue is often combined with sialic acids in mammals (Lerouge et al., 1998).

### Oligosaccharide precursor construction

In eukaryotes, the formation of protein N-glycans is initiated in the ER with the biosynthesis of a lipid-linked oligosaccharide precursor. This biosynthetic pathway is highly conserved in animals, plants, fungi, and social amoeba (for review Kukuruzinska and Lennon, 1998). Glc<sub>3</sub>Man<sub>9</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub>, the oligosaccharide precursor for protein N-glycosylation, is first assembled on a polyisoprenol carrier lipid, dolichol phosphate (Dol-P), through the stepwise addition of monosaccharides in a succession of reactions catalyzed by a family of ER-localized, membrane-bound glycosyltransferases. The first seven sugars constitutive of this precursor are then transferred from the sugar nucleotides UDP-GlcNAc and GDP-Man onto the cytosolic face of the ER. It is generally accepted, but still not fully demonstrated, that a flippase, RFT1 (Frank et al., 2008),

transfers the heptasaccharide lipid intermediate Man<sub>5</sub>Glc-NAc<sub>2</sub>-PP Dol across the membrane bilayer into the ER lumen (Sanyal and Menon, 2009). The subsequent reactions entailing the transfer of four Man residues from Dol-P-Man and three Glc moieties from Dol-P-Glc involve different luminally oriented glycosyltransferases, ALG3, ALG6, ALG8, ALG9, ALG10, and ALG12, named after their respective yeast homologs (Figure 1). Most data currently available on the dolichol pathway in plants were obtained following treatment with tunicamycin, a specific inhibitor of the enzyme that transfers GlcNAc-1-P onto Dol-P. While a long-term treatment of plants with tunicamycin is generally lethal, early responses in tunicamycin-treated plants include deficient protein folding (D'Amico et al., 1992; Sparvoli et al., 2000) and the inhibition of extracellular protein secretion (Faye and Chrispeels, 1989). A functional homolog of the ALG3 (Asn-Linked Glycosylation) mannosyltransferase, which is responsible for the first mannosylation step of the lipid-linked N-glycan in the ER lumen, was recently identified and characterized in Arabidopsis (Henquet et al., 2008). Interestingly, and by contrast with plant treatment with tunicamycin, a knockout of ALG3 activity was not lethal in Arabidopsis mutants. The recent identification of several homologs of yeast ALG glycosyltransferases in the genome of Arabidopsis (see Table S1) now offers opportunities for detailed studies on the physiological importance of the different glycosyltransferases involved in the dolichol pathway in plants.

Most eukaryotes synthesize a dolichol-PP-linked oligosaccharide precursor made of Glc₃Man₉GlcNAc₂, following the reference pathway illustrated in Figure 1. However, sequence homology searches in fully sequenced genomes using yeast ALG enzymes as query sequences have revealed an extensive secondary loss of ALG genes in some organisms, including plants (Samuelson et al., 2005, Fitchette, A-C. and Gomord, V., unpub. data and Figure 3). In line with these bioinformatic analyses, biochemical studies have shown that some organisms are producing truncated N-glycan precursors. Interestingly, the absence of ALG6, ALG8 and ALG10 in the genome of the green alga Ostreococcus tauri suggests the transfer of a Man₉GlcNAc₂ oligosaccharide precursor onto the nascent glycoproteins, as previously described for Trypanosoma cruzi (Jones et al., 2005). Based on the same approach, one can anticipate that some other plants are producing truncated dolichol oligosaccharide precursors lacking Glc and/or Man residues as illustrated in Figure 3.

Transfer of the oligosaccharide precursor onto the nascent protein

After maturation, the oligosaccharide precursor is transferred 'en bloc' from the dolichol carrier to Asn residues of the nascent polypeptides within the consensus sequence Asn-X-Ser/Thr, where X is any amino acid except Pro. This reaction is catalysed by the heterooligomeric oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex. The mammalian OST complex consists of seven to eight non-identical subunits, compared to nine protein subunits identified for the yeast OST complex (Table S1), five of which are required for the oligosaccharide transfer in vivo (Knauer and Lehle, 1999). Interestingly, two distinct OST isoforms with different (STT3) catalytic subunits were recently shown to be responsible for the co- and post-translational N-glycosylation of mammalian polypeptides. Complete glycosylation of polypeptides involves the cooperation of both OST isoforms (Ruiz-Canada et al.,

2009) acting along a co- or post-translational pathway. In Arabidopsis, five genes encoding OST subunits, including two STT3 isoforms (Kelleher and Gillmore, 2006), have been identified by homology searches, but only three have been formally characterized so far (Gallois et al., 1997; Koiwa et al., 2003; Lerouxel et al., 2005; Pattison and Amtmann, 2009 for a recent review). The presence of two genes encoding STT3 in Arabidopsis makes it reasonable to speculate that co- and post-translational transfer of the oligosaccharide precursor onto the nascent polypeptide chain could also occur in plants, as shown in mammals (Ruiz-Canada et al., 2009).

### Maturation of the N-glycan

As illustrated in Figure 1, the oligosaccharide precursor Glc₃Man₉GlcNAc₂ is immediately trimmed in the ER following its transfer onto the nascent glycoprotein. In mammals, N-glycan trimming occurs through the sequential action of glucosidase I (GCSI), glucosidase II (GCSII) and a mannosidase to yield a Man₈GlcNAc₂ oligosaccharide (Szumilo et al., 1986a,b; Kaushal et al., 1990a,b; Hebert et al., 2005), while no ER mannosidase has been described so far in plants. In parallel, a transient reglucosylation of the glycan chain by an ER luminal enzyme, an UDP-Glc:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase (UGGT), may occur subsequently to the elimination of the three Glc residues (Parodi et al., 1984; Trombetta et al., 1989). This reglucosylation occurs on non-native glycoproteins only, thereby supporting the hypothesis of a role for UGGT in protein quality control in the ER as a molecular sensor for unfolded glycoproteins (Jin et al., 2007). As illustrated in Figure 1, the alternate action of GCSII and UGGT drives cycles of glycoprotein release from and binding to calnexin (CNX)/calreticulin (CRT), until the glycoprotein is correctly folded and exported to the GA (McCracken and Brodsky, 1996; Helenius and Aebi, 2004). In contrast, terminally misfolded glycoproteins are retro-translocated from the ER to the cytosol for proteasomal degradation through ER-associated degradation (ERAD). Two putative sugar binding proteins, Htm1p and Yos9p, that respectively generate and recognize a Man₇GlcNAc₂ signal, are required for the ERAD machinery to distinguish terminally misfolded glycoproteins from abundant folded intermediates in the ER lumen (Quan et al., 2008).

Correctly folded proteins are transported from the ER to the GA, where N-glycans are further modified during transport of the glycoprotein from cis to medial and trans cisternae. α-Mannosidase I (MANI) first removes one to four α1,2 Man residues and converts Man₉GlcNAc₂ to Man₅GlcNAc₂ (Szumilo et al., 1986b; Sturm et al., 1987a). The biosynthesis of complex-type N-glycans then starts with the addition of a first N-acetylglucosamine residue to the α1,3 Man branch of the Man₅GlcNAc₂ high-Man-type N-glycan. This step is catalysed by N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I (GNTI) to yield GlcNAc-Man₅GlcNAc₂ (Johnson and Chrispeels, 1987; Tezuka et al., 1992). With the exception of GCSII (Trombetta et al., 1996; Soussilane et al., 2009), which is a soluble heterodimer, all plant N-glycans-processing enzymes are type II membrane proteins. Unlike GCSI, which is localized exclusively in the ER, MANI and GNTI are located in both the cis-Golgi and the ER (Nebenführ et al., 1999; Saint-Jore-Dupas et al., 2006; Boulafous et al., 2009), and signals responsible for their proper location in the early secretory pathway were recently characterized (Saint-Jore-Dupas et al., 2006; Boulafous et al., 2009). After processing by GNTI, two additional Man residues are removed from GlcNAcMan₅GlcNAc₂ by α-mannosidase II (GMII) (Kaushal et al., 1990b; Strasser et al., 2006), followed by the N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase II (GNTII)-mediated transfer of an additional outer N-acetylglucosamine residue due to the α1,6 Man branch to convert the hybrid maturing glycan to a complex-type N-glycan (Johnson and Chrispeels, 1987; Tezuka et al., 1992; Strasser et al., 1999). At this stage, α1,3 fucosylation and β1,2 xylosylation of the core Man₃GlcNAc₂ frequently occur to yield plant-specific N-linked glycans. Studies on the substrate specificity of α1,3 fucosyltransferase (α1,3 FucT) and β1,2 xylosyltransferase (β1,2 XylT) have shown that the presence of at least one terminal N-acetylglucosamine residue is a prerequisite for the transfer of α1,3 fucose and β1,2 xylose (Johnson and Chrispeels, 1987; Tezuka et al., 1992; Staudacher et al., 1995; Zeng et al., 1997).

Plant N-linked glycans containing only one β1,2 xylose or only one β1,3 fucose residue have been identified in several plant glycoproteins (Sturm et al., 1987b; D'Andrea et al., 1988; Hayashi et al., 1990; Ohsuga et al., 1996; Costa et al., 1997). The substrate specificities of α1,3 FucT and β1,2 XylT were shown not to be affected, respectively, by the absence of β1,2 xylose or α1,3 fucose residues on the glycan core (Johnson and Chrispeels, 1987; Tezuka et al., 1992; Staudacher et al., 1995; Zeng et al., 1997), which suggests that α1,3 fucosylation and β1,2 xylosylation in plants are independent events. Using an immunocytochemical approach to study the subcompartmentalization of β1,2 xylosylation and α1,3 fucosylation, together with the subcellular localization of these

glycosyltransferases, we have shown that these two maturation steps occur mostly in medial and trans Golgi cisternae, respectively (Lainé et al., 1991; Fitchette-Lainé et al., 1994; Pagny et al., 2003). This indicates that, during transport of the glycoprotein through the GA, the transfer of β1,2 xylose to the glycan core starts before the addition of α1,3 fucose (Fitchette-Lainé et al., 1994). Interestingly, α1,3 FucT and β1,2 XylT could also act on a GlcNAcMan₅GlcNAc₂ substrate, which suggests that at least two routes are possible for the biosynthesis of complex N-glycans in plants (Wilson et al., 2001a; Bencúr et al., 2005; Strasser et al., 2006), and that hybrid N-glycans could result from an uncompleted action of GMI.

The transfer of β1,2 xylose and α1,3 fucose may be followed by a further maturation of complex-type N-glycans to yield one or two Galβ1,3(Fucα1,4)GlcNAc antennae (Fitchette-Lainé et al., 1997; Melo et al., 1997). This sequence motif, known as the Le<sup>a</sup> epitope, is usually found on cell surface glycoconjugates in mammals, where it is involved in cell–cell recognition and cell adhesion processes. The biosynthesis of a plant Le<sup>a</sup> epitope is initiated with the addition of a galactose residue to a terminal GlcNAc residue by the action of a β1,3 galactosyltransferase (β1,3 GalT), giving a Galβ1,3GlcNAc type I oligosaccharide (Strasser et al., 2007b). An α1,4 fucosyltransferase (α1,4 FucT) then completes the biosynthesis of the Le<sup>a</sup> epitope. Studies on the substrate specificity of plant α1,4 FucTs have shown that this enzyme specifically transfers fucose from GDP-fucose to Galβ1,3GlcNAc (Wilson, 2001; Léonard et al., 2002, 2005a).

After maturation in the ER and the GA, complex-type N-glycans can be further modified during the transit of glycoproteins to their final destination. For instance, most vacuolar glycoproteins and seed storage glycoproteins described so far were found to be N-glycosylated with the same, typical kind of modified N-glycans containing fucose and/or xylose residues but lacking terminal Le<sup>a</sup> or GlcNAc residues at their non-reducing ends (Sturm et al., 1987b; Gutternigg et al., 2007; Strasser et al., 2008). These typical vacuole-type oligosaccharide side chains are named paucimannose-type N-glycans (Figure 1). Because we know that the presence of a terminal GlcNAc residue added by GNTI is required for the transfer of α1,3 fucose and β1,2 xylose residues, paucimannose-type N-glycans can only result from post-Golgi modifications on complex-type N-glycans, which is consistent with the recent identification in Arabidopsis of a vacuolar enzyme capable to trim terminal GlcNAc residues from complex N-glycans (Gutternigg et al., 2007; Strasser et al., 2007a).


Paucimannose-type N-glycans linked to vacuolar glycoproteins could also result from the degradation of larger Le<sup>a</sup>-containing N-glycans, by the successive action of exoglycosidases in a prevacuolar compartment or in the vacuole, as proposed in Figure 1. In contrast, several soluble and membrane-bound extracellular proteins were found to contain intact complex-type N-glycans including Le<sup>a</sup>-containing oligosaccharides but these glycans may also be partially degraded by exoglycosidases after secretion in the extracellular compartment (Fitchette et al., 1999; Tezuka et al., 1993; Strasser et al., 2007a). Free N-glycans and endoglucanase activities described long time ago in different plant organs (see Priem and Gross, 1992; Lhernould et al., 1992) indicate that, in addition to their partial trimming by exoglycosidases, N-glycans can be partly or completely cleaved off from the protein backbone by endoglycosidases in the plant secretory pathway. This was recently illustrated with the characterization of an anti-HIV-1, 2G12 antibody having short N-glycans consisting of a single GlcNAc residue when produced in maize or tobacco seeds (Rademacher et al., 2008; Floss et al., 2009).

Any species-, organ- or development-specific N-glycosylation in plants?

Although the general scheme of N-glycan biosynthesis and maturation is conserved in plants, their structure may differ from one species to another. For example, glycoproteins in Chlorophyta phylum bear N-glycans of the high-Man-type, and the presence of complex N-linked glycans remains hypothetical in these green algae (Müller et al., 1985; Ishida et al., 1993; Gödel et al., 2000; Becker and Rüsing, 2003). By contrast, glycoproteins from lower organisms of the Bryophyta phylum, such as liverworts, hornworts and mosses, not only bear high-Man-type N-glycans, but also bear complex-type N-glycans with β1,2 xylose, core α1,3 fucose and antennae with terminal GlcNAc residue(s) and/or Le<sup>a</sup> trisaccharide(s) (Fitchette et al., 1999; Viëtor et al., 2003; Mega, 2007). Complex N-glycans were also observed in ferns and other primitive Pteridophytina tracheophytes (Fitchette et al., 1999; Mega, 2007). In a similar way, all higher plants studied so far, including primitive cycas and Ginkgo biloba, present N-linked glycans ranging from high Man to complex N-glycans, with one or two terminal Le<sup>a</sup> antennae (Fitchette et al., 1999; Alisi et al., 2001; Wilson et al., 2001b; Léonard et al., 2004; Kimura et al., 2005). For several years, the Brassicaceae family, in which terminal Le<sup>a</sup> antennae were undetectable, was considered as an except-

tion to the general N-glycosylation scheme in higher plants (Fitchette et al., 1999; Rayon et al., 1999; Wilson et al., 2001b; Strasser et al., 2004; Mega, 2004, 2007), but, as illustrated here in Figure 4, recent studies reported the presence of the Le<sup>a</sup> epitope in Arabidopsis and Brassica napus, although restricted to specific organs (Léonard et al., 2002; Strasser et al., 2008).

When looking at the distribution of N-linked glycans in higher plant organs, some discrepancies can be observed. In monocots, as in dicots, vegetative organs such as leaves (Wilson et al., 1998; Fitchette et al., 1999) or roots (Wilson et al., 2001b; Mega, 2004; Huet, Y. and Fitchette, A-C., unpub. data) produce glycoproteins with high-Man-type N-glycans, as well as complex-N-glycans containing β1,2 xylose, α1,3 fucose and terminal GlcNAc or Le<sup>a</sup> antennae. The same structural diversity was described for glycoproteins from the fruits of monocots (Léonard et al., 2004) and dicots (Wilson et al., 2001b). While it was generally accepted that glycoproteins in the pollen have N-linked complex glycans devoid of Le<sup>a</sup> antennae in Gymnosperms (Kimura et al., 2001), monocots (Kimura et al., 2003;

Wilson and Altmann, 1998) and dicots (Wilson and Altmann, 1998), recent results in our laboratory point to the presence of high-Man-, paucimannosidic- and Le<sup>a</sup> complex-N-glycans in grass pollen (Figure 5) (Manduzzio, H. and Faye, L., unpub. data). Major differences between N-glycosylation patterns in monocots and dicots concern seed glycoproteins. The seeds of monocots such as rice or maize seem to be devoid of, or at least very poor in, terminal Le<sup>a</sup> antennae (Bardor et al., 2003; Léonard et al., 2004), in contrast with the clear abundance of this structural element in seeds of several dicots including buckwheat, walnut tree, hazelnut, peanut, pea or mung bean (Wilson et al., 2001b). A systematic analysis of organ-specific N-glycosylation carried out to assess the distribution of Le<sup>a</sup> antennae in Arabidopsis showed the occurrence of Le<sup>a</sup>-containing N-glycans on glycoproteins from pedicels, stems and nodes, and to a lesser extent on the glycoproteins of siliques, shoot apices and roots, in contrast with leaf and petiole glycoproteins presenting no evidence of Le<sup>a</sup> extensions (Strasser et al., 2008). A similar study performed with B. napus, another Brassicaceae, led to similar

Despite these fluctuations, an overall assessment of the current literature suggests that the N-glycan maturation machinery is highly conserved in plants, with most variations in glycosylation patterns corresponding to species- and organ-related variations in the relative abundance of specific structural elements such as the Le<sup>a</sup> antennae. Our general view of the situation, however, is still rudimentary, and there is obviously a need for systematic studies on the N-glycosylation patterns of model therapeutic glycoproteins expressed in different expression systems, from seeds to green leafy organs.

### Plant complex N-glycans are immunogenic

Most pharmaceutical proteins are complex proteins requiring multiple co- or post-translational modifications to show biological activity. Although plants can perform most of these modifications including N-glycosylation (Gomord and Faye, 2004), structural differences between plant and mammalian complex N-glycans currently limit the commercial production of glycosylated PMPs, especially for those proteins considered for parenteral administration (Gomord et al., 2005; Walsh and Jefferis, 2006). Plant complex N-glycans were shown indeed to be immunogenic, as indicated by the detection of antibodies specific for plant glycoepitopes in laboratory mammals and human sera (Gomord et al., 2005). Three immunogenic glycoepitopes typical of plant glycoprotein N-glycans have been identified, namely the β1,2 xylose-containing epitope, the α1,3 fucose-containing epitope and the Le<sup>a</sup> epitope. Interestingly, antibodies specific to these glycoepitopes are not specific for a defined plant glycoprotein and recognize carbohydrate targets regardless of the carrier protein. This is convincingly illustrated when antibodies specific for either α1,3 fucose- or β1,2 xylose-containing glycoepitopes, raised in rabbits immunized with horseradish peroxidase or with a plant-made human monoclonal antibody, cross-react with glycoproteins containing the same carbohydrate epitopes, such as honey bee phospholipase A2 or *Helix pomatia* hemocyanin (Faye et al., 1993; Jin et al., 2008).

β1,2 Xylose- or α1,3 fucose-containing glycoepitopes are known as important IgE binding carbohydrate determinants on plant allergens (Aalberse et al., 1981; Faye and Chrispeels, 1988; van Ree and Aalberse, 1995; Garcia-Casado et al., 1996; van Ree et al., 2000), and also elicit IgG production in humans (Bardor et al., 2003). The presence of such antibodies in the human serum may induce a rapid immune clearance of glycosylated PMPs from the circulation, and thus strongly compromise their effectiveness *in vivo* as therapeutic agents. In addition to an accelerated clearance, the presence of IgE antibodies directed against carbohydrate epitopes of plant glycoproteins may expose more than 20% of allergic patients (Mari, 2002 and our unpublished results) receiving glycosylated PMPs to a severe hypersensitivity reaction, as recently described for a chimeric mouse-human IgG1 monoclonal antibody used for colorectal cancer therapy (Cetuximab/Erbitux; Bristol-Myers Squibb (New York, NY, USA) and ImClone Systems (New York, NY, USA)). Cetuximab is produced in a mouse SP2/0 cell line, which expresses the gene for α1,3 GalT. The intravenous injection of this monoclonal antibody was shown to induce anaphylactic reactions in patients producing IgE antibodies that bind the Galα1,3Gal glycoepitope of non-primate mammalian N-glycans present on the Fab portion of the Cetuximab heavy chain (see Figure 2 for an illustration) (Chung et al., 2008). Even though a topical application of PMPs with complex N-glycans has no adverse

effects in human allergic patients with IgE antibodies against plant N-glycans (Ma et al., 1998; Zeitlin et al., 1998; Mari et al., 2008), recent findings obtained from Cetuximab clearly illustrate that plant-specific glycoepitopes may represent a clinically relevant and serious issue for parenteral administration of PMPs in humans. From a safety and regulatory standpoint, this fully justifies recent developments in the engineering of plant expression platforms deficient in performing plant-specific maturations on complex N-glycans.

### N-glycosylation engineering in plant expression systems

Considerable progress has been made in recent years to redesign protein N-glycan structures in plant systems, using different strategies including targeting of the recombinant protein to the ER, inactivation of the host plant's endogenous glycosyltransferases and de novo expression of heterologous glycosyltransferases for the addition of mammalian-type sugars to complex glycan structures (Saint-Jore-Dupas et al., 2007).

#### Targeted expression to the ER

Proteins resident of the ER lumen contain high-Man-type N-glycans structurally similar in plant and mammalian cells (Navazio et al., 1996; Pagny et al., 2000). Taking advantage of the conserved C-terminal signals H/KDEL for protein retention in the ER (Gomord et al., 1997), KDEL tags were fused to both the heavy and light chains of recombinant antibodies for targeted expression in the ER. Although in some cases, a significant proportion of complex N-glycans was still detected on KDEL-tagged antibodies, probably because of either some leakage in the retrieval system or a partial proteolytic cleavage of the tag (Tekoah et al., 2004; Floss et al., 2008), this strategy often resulted in the production of plantibodies mainly containing non-immunogenic high-Man-type N-glycans (Ko et al., 2003; Sriraman et al., 2004; Petruccelli et al., 2006; Floss et al., 2009). In addition to the absence of antigenic glycoepitopes, the shorter half-life of an antibody with high-Man-type N-glycans can turn in some cases into an advantage, for instance when the persistence of an antibody used for passive immunotherapy could interfere with active immunization in the patient’s circulatory system (Schumacher, 1992; Ko et al., 2003), or when rapid blood clearance might reduce the nonspecific toxicity of an antibody conjugate used for cancer immunotherapy (Kogelberg et al., 2007).

PMPs with high-Man-type N-glycans also offer a number of other potential, but yet unexploited applications, involving notably their targeting to the Man-specific cell surface receptors of macrophages and dendritic cells.

Knockout strategies to prevent the addition of unwanted sugar residues

Gene inactivation or silencing may be used to reduce or eliminate the activity of plant-specific glycosyltransferases. Because of the ease with which the targeted ‘knockout’ of specific genes can be performed by homologous recombination in *Physcomitrella patens*, this moss has been engineered to produce a strain that does not add β1,2 xylose or α1,3 fucose to maturing glycan chains, to produce instead glycoproteins with a core heptasaccharide identical to that found on a human IgG (Koprivova et al., 2004). The availability of protein N-glycosylation mutants in *Arabidopsis* has also allowed for the production of therapeutic glycoproteins devoid of plant-specific glyco-epitopes (Strasser et al., 2004; Downing et al., 2006).

RNA interference (RNAi) strategies were recently devised to knockout α1,3 FucT and β1,2 XylT activities in different species (Cox et al., 2006; Sourrouille et al., 2008; Strasser et al., 2008). In sharp contrast with the high efficiency of this approach in the aquatic plant *Lemna minor* (Cox et al., 2006), an effective but incomplete downregulation of β1,2 XylT and α1,3 FucT activities was observed in RNAi lines of *Medicago sativa* and *Nicotiana benthamiana* (Sourrouille et al., 2008; Strasser et al., 2008). The question now is to determine whether the successful implementation of protein glycoengineering in plant expression platforms would be species specific, with a relatively inefficient output in some species such as *N. benthamiana* and *M. sativa*, compared to other species such as *L. minor* allowing for the complete elimination of plant-specific glycan maturations. The answer might actually depend on which glycoprotein one refers to, and not to the host species. Successful optimization of N-glycosylation in *L. minor* was achieved using the monoclonal antibody MDX-060 as a model (Cox et al., 2006), similar to Strasser et al. (2008) using another antibody, human 2G12 monoclonal antibody, to demonstrate the absence of β1,2 xylose or α1,3 fucose-containing N-glycan structures in *N. benthamiana* β1,2 XylT and α1,3 FucT RNAi lines. It is interesting to note, in the latter case, that β1,2 xylose and α1,3 fucose residues were still detected on N-glycans of the host plant’s endogenous glycoproteins (Strasser et al., 2008), thus suggesting a certain protein-specific efficiency of the proposed approach.
These findings also indicate that an incomplete downregulation of β1,2 XylT and α1,3 FucT activities is sufficient to allow for the generation of IgG lacking β1,2 xylose and α1,3 fucose residues. Although additional data remain necessary for more definitive conclusions, the absence of these sugars on antibody structures can be tentatively attributed to a reduced accessibility for *N*-glycan maturation enzymes to oligosaccharide side chains at position Asn-297 on the IgG-Fc structure, and IgG antibodies, in this context, might not represent the best reporter proteins to assess the overall efficiency of glycoengineering strategies.

By comparison, testing these strategies on endogenous glycosylation patterns, with no *a priori* regarding the recombinant protein to express, might provide a realistic view of the worst-case scenario that could then serve as a workable starting point for the design of a ‘universal’ plant-based production platform.

It is conceivable, and eventually justified, to dedicate glycoengineering strategies to the production of recombinant antibodies, considering their potentially high commercial value. Some important issues, however, would still have to be addressed to support such efforts. For example, between 20% and 30% of human IgG antibodies bear *N*-glycans within the Fab region and are fully accessible to the glycosylation processing machinery (Jefferis, 2009). Antibodies produced in plant expression systems also not only bear β1,2 xylose- and α1,3 fucose-containing glycoepitopes, but also bear one or two Le<sup>a</sup> epitope(s) (see Petrucelli et al., 2006 for illustration). It is somewhat surprising that so little attention has been paid until now to this structural element typical of plant protein *N*-glycans (Fitchette-Lainé et al., 1997; Melo et al., 1997), detected exclusively on native extracellular glycoproteins and recombinant glycoproteins targeted for secretion in the apoplast.

The Le<sup>a</sup> trisaccharide Galβ1,3(Fucα1,4)GlcNAc was originally described as a human blood group determinant related to the A, B, O antigens. This antigen is strongly immunogenic in laboratory mammals, as indicated for instance by the production of Le<sup>a</sup>-specific antibodies in mice injected with glycolipids from newborn human meconium (Young et al., 1983), or in rabbits injected with a Le<sup>a</sup>-rich purified sycamore cell wall laccase (Fitchette-Lainé et al., 1997). In both cases, antibodies specific to either the human or plant Le<sup>a</sup> glycoepitopes caused the agglutination of Le<sup>a</sup>-positive human erythrocytes (Fitchette-Lainé et al., 1997). Although Lewis blood group determinants are not as important in transfusion protocols as ABO blood groups, Le<sup>a</sup>-specific antibodies have been shown to

cause haemolytic transfusion reactions (Poole and Daniels, 2007), and the presence of a Le<sup>a</sup> antigen on glycosylated PMPs should obviously be avoided. A promising development towards this goal was recently provided by Sourrouille et al. (2008) reporting that the expression of hβ1,4 GalT, a human galactosyltransferase, in transgenic alfalfa was not only competing efficiently with β1,2 XylT and α1,3 FucT activities *in planta*, but also completely preventing the biosynthesis of complex *N*-glycans with Le<sup>a</sup> glycoepitopes.

Knockin of heterologous glycosyltransferases for the production of galactosylated and sialylated *N*-glycans

Most circulating human glycoproteins are *N*-glycosylated with oligosaccharides that are ‘capped’ by neuraminic acid (NeuAc) on penultimate β1,4 galactose residues (Figure 2). The absence of terminal sialic acid residues on glycosylated PMPs reduces their clinical efficiency because of a rapid clearance *via* the galactose-specific hepatic asialoglycoprotein receptor (Stockert, 1995). For example, the plasma half-life of a recombinant erythropoietin (EPO) sialylated variant was estimated at 5–6 h, compared to 2 min for desialylated EPO (Erbayraktar et al., 2003). This positive impact of sialic acid on protein stability likely explains why knockin strategies for glycoengineering in plants have mainly focused on the addition of terminal β1,4 galactose and sialic acid residues to humanize *N*-glycans. When expressed in transgenic plants, the galactose-processing enzyme hβ1,4 GalT was shown to add β1,4 galactose residues on plant *N*-glycans, but with a relatively low efficiency (Palacpac et al., 1999; Bakker et al., 2001; Fujiyama et al., 2001; Misaki et al., 2003). As previously shown in yeast and mammalian cells (Choi et al., 2003; Hamilton et al., 2003; Ferrara et al., 2006; Jacobs et al., 2009), the targeting of glycosyltransferases to specific subcellular locations could strongly improve the efficiency of knockin strategies for protein glycoengineering. Supporting this, recent papers have illustrated the potential of expressing a mammalian glycosyltransferase precisely targeted along the plant cell secretory pathway by fusing its catalytic domain to the localization domain of a plant glycosyltransferase (Bakker et al., 2006; D’Aoust et al., 2008; US patent WO/2008/151440; Frey et al., 2009; Vézina et al., 2009).

Using transient expression assays and a large panel of targeting signals (Saint-Jore-Dupas et al., 2006; US patent WO/2008/056265), a fast screening of the best subcellular locations is now possible to generate an

effective synthetic glycosylation pathway based on the action of different heterologous glycosyltransferases. The efficiency of this strategy was recently illustrated when a transient expression protocol in *N. benthamiana* leaves involving the simultaneous expression of a recombinant antibody and a hybrid fusion protein, GNTI-GalT, comprising the localization domain of Arabidopsis GNTI for anchoring in the early Golgi and the catalytic domain of hβ1,4 GalT, has allowed for the fast and high-yield production of an antibody with human-like N-glycans (Vézina et al., 2009).

By comparison, the successful generation of N-glycan sialylation *in planta* is still more demanding considering that, with the exception of a low specificity CMP-sialic acid transporter recently cloned in *Arabidopsis thaliana* (Bakker et al., 2008), plant cells lack most of the enzymatic machinery required to synthesize and transfer Neu5Ac residues from CMP-Neu5Ac to β1,4 galactose residues (Séveno et al., 2004; Zeleny et al., 2006). However, recent developments suggest that engineering the whole biosynthetic pathway for the synthesis, activation, transport and transfer of NeuAc would be feasible in plants, as previously shown for insect cells and *Pichia pastoris* (Jarvis, 2003; Hamilton et al., 2006). Indeed, most proteins constituent of this complex biosynthetic pathway involving the Golgi lumen, the cytosol and the nucleus in mammalian cells were already expressed in plants (Wee et al., 1998; Misaki et al., 2006; Paccalet et al., 2007). Further supporting the potential of this approach, the co-expression of three key enzymes of the mammalian Neu5Ac biosynthesis pathway in *Arabidopsis* was recently described, leading to the successful production of CMP-Neu5Ac (Castilho et al., 2008). The next and final step to formally achieve sialylation *in planta* will be to simultaneously express one or two additional genes in the same plant expression system and to confirm that CMP-Kdo transporters from plants are sufficiently efficient to transfer CMP-sialic acid from the cytosol to a heterologous sialytransferase in the Golgi lumen.

the structure of the glycan core, as illustrated in Figure 6a (Schachter and Brockhausen, 1992; Tarp and Clausen, 2008). The presence of O-linked glycans strongly influences different physicochemical properties of a protein, such as folding, solubility, stability and resistance to heat or proteolysis. For instance, mucin-type O-glycans may bind large amounts of water molecules, giving mucins the capacity to form a protective layer over the epithelium. In the same way, the O-glycans of cell surface-bound mucins control antigenicity and bind to mammalian lectins (Brockhausen, 2006). O-linked glycosylation also affects the bioactivity of many signalling molecules, particularly hormones and cytokines (for a recent review see Wopereis et al., 2006).

In plants, O-glycosylation has been described mainly for the hydroxyl groups of Hyp, Ser and Thr residues. Plant and mammalian O-glycans usually are considered as structurally different, but with two notable exceptions. A first exception is the nucleocytoplasmic O-glycosylation observed during the transient addition of a single N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) residue onto Ser and Thr residues of the peptide backbone (Zachara and Hart, 2006; Faye, L. and Tran, O., unpub. data). The second exception is a putative mammalian mucin-type O-glycosylation reported for some plant Golgi membrane proteins and rice glutelin (Mitsui et al., 1990; Kishimoto et al., 1999).

The main O-glycosylated proteins in plants, extensins and arabinogalactan proteins (AGPs), belong to a large group of glycoproteins known as Hyp-rich glycoproteins (HRGPs). The O-glycosylation of HRGPs results from two consecutive post-translational modifications involving the hydroxylation of some Pro residues by prolyl 4-hydroxylases (P4Hs) in the ER, and the subsequent O-glycosylation of some, but not all, Hyp residues by glycosyltransferases in the GA. Extensins are extensively O-glycosylated, with one to four arabinosyl residues O-linked onto most Hyp residues, and galactose (Gal) residues bound to many Ser residues (Figure 6b), two types of O-glycosylation that were also described for lectins in Solanaceae (Showalter, 2001). AGPs are the most highly glycosylated HRGPs, with Hyp residues frequently glycosylated by either large arabinogalactan glycomodules (Figure 6b) or short unbranched arabinooligosaccharides (Pope, 1977; Qi et al., 1991). HRGPs are involved in many aspects of plant growth and development (for a recent review see Seifert and Roberts (2007)), and many effects of O-linked glycosylation on the biological activity of these proteins have been described. Reagents binding or cleaving the O-glycans of AGPs were shown, for instance, to

Protein O-glycans are structurally different in plants and humans

Mucin-type O-glycans, O-GlcNAc, together with xylose residues O-linked to Ser or Thr in proteoglycans, are the most abundant O-glycans in humans. Mucin-type O-glycosylation is found on mucins as well as on many other human glycoproteins. This type of O-glycosylation starts with the addition of an N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) residue onto the hydroxyl groups of Ser or Thr. Mucin-type O-glycans are very heterogeneous, and classified according to

O-glycosylation of human proteins expressed in transgenic plants

In humans, O-glycosylation is essential for the expression or biological activity of many proteins. For example, O-glycans influence the expression of glycoporin A at the cell surface of human erythrocytes (Remaley et al., 1991), or the biological activity of interleukin-5 (Kodama et al., 1993) and human lactase phlorizin hydrolase (Naim and Lentze, 1992).

Given their natural ability to perform O-glycosylation, plants may represent a good option for the production of therapeutic glycoproteins requiring O-glycans, but as noted earlier, the structure of O-glycans may strongly differ depending on the host species used for expression. In particular, therapeutic O-glycoproteins produced in plant cells contain non-human O-glycans that might elicit an immune response in humans. This potential risk associated with plant-specific O-glycans is further reinforced by the lack of a well-defined consensus sequence for protein O-glycosylation. As well, the substrate specificity of plant P4Hs remains to be established. P4Hs have been purified from many plants, but only two P4Hs from *A. thaliana*,

At-P4H-1 and At-P4H-2 (Hieta and Myllyharju, 2002; Tiainen et al., 2004), one from the green alga *Chlamydomonas reinhardtii*, Cr-P4H-1 (Keskiaho et al., 2007), and one from *Nicotiana tabacum* (Yuasa et al., 2005) have been cloned and characterized in detail. Surprisingly, whereas tobacco and barley P4Hs are apparently unable to hydroxylate proline residues in recombinant human collagen (Ruggiero et al., 2000; Eskelin et al., 2009), At-P4H-1 and Cr-P4H-1 were both shown to hydroxylate the collagen-like peptide (Pro–Pro–Gly)$_{10}$ with a good efficiency (Tiainen et al., 2004; Keskiäho et al., 2007). In this context, where at least some plant P4Hs have the capacity to hydroxylate Pro residues constitutive of mammalian proteins and thus provide acceptors for O-glycosyltransferases, it is surprising that so little attention has been paid yet to the O-glycosylation status of therapeutic proteins produced in plants.

The Hyp contiguity hypothesis, originally formulated by Kieliszewski and Lamport (1994) and further validated experimentally (Tan et al., 2003; Shimizu et al., 2005; Xu et al., 2008), defines general rules to predict Pro hydroxylation and Hyp O-glycosylation. The target motif for O-glycosylation consists of at least two [Ala/Ser/Thr/Val]–Hyp repeats (Tan et al., 2003), with two consecutive Hyp not separated by more than 11 amino acids residues (Schultz et al., 2002; Faik et al., 2006). Hyp repeats in [Ala/Ser/Thr/Val]–Hyp$_{(2,4)}$ glycomodules would also represent the attachment sites for linear arabinooligosaccharides (Tan et al., 2003; Xu et al., 2008).

Based on these informations, the following ‘consensus’ motif [Ala/Ser/Thr/Val]–Pro$_{(1,4)}$–X$_{(0,10)}$–[Ala/Ser/Thr/Val]–Pro$_{(1,4)}$, where X can be any amino acid, can be used to predict the addition of linear arabinosyl chains and/or arabinogalactans to the Hyp residues of plant proteins (Figure 7a). The occurrence of this glycomodule in human proteins was analysed through the Swiss-Prot database with the ScanProsite tool (http://www.expasy.org/tools/scanprosite/). Of 20 332 human protein sequences in the Swiss-Prot database (release 57.2), 5951 sequences were shown to contain ([Ala/Ser/Thr/Val]–Pro$_{(1,4)}$–X$_{(0,10)}$–[Ala/–Ser/Thr/Val]–Pro$_{(1,4)})_y$ contiguous or overlapping repeats with a $y$ value >2 (Figure 7b). Interestingly, some human proteins frequently produced in plant systems, such as the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) (Wang et al., 2005), were identified as very good candidates for Hyp-O-glycosylation based on the presence of this predictive motif (Figure 7c).

The predictive value of this approach was convincingly validated by a study assessing the O-glycosylation of a recombinant human IgA1 expressed in transgenic maize

(Karnoup et al., 2005). As illustrated in Figure 8a, human IgA1 is extensively O-glycosylated within a 23-amino acids hinge region containing nine potential O-glycosylation sites, of which five are fully or partially occupied (Baenziger and Kornfeld, 1974; Mellis and Baenziger, 1983; Kabat et al., 1991; Mattu et al., 1998). In humans, the addition of mucin-type O-glycans on Ser and Thr residues constitutive of the heavy chain ‘PVPSTPPTPSPSTPPTPSPS’ sequence was shown to protect the exposed region of the hinge from proteolytic degradation (Kerr, 1990; Mattu et al., 1998). As it could be anticipated from the presence of five [A/S/T/V]–P$_{(1,4)}$–X$_{(0,10)}$–[A/S/T/V]–P$_{(1,4)}$, O-Hyp glycomodules in its primary sequence (Figure 7c), plant-specific O-glycosylation occurred on the PVPSTPPTPSPSTPPTPSPS peptide of this human IgA1 expressed in maize. More specifically, up to six Pro residues were hydroxylated to undergo extensive arabinosylation, with an average molecular ratio of six arabinose units per IgA1 molecule (Figure 8a). Further studies will be required now to elucidate whether Pro/Hyp conversion and extensin-like O-linked arabinosylation may have positive effects on the stability and biological activity of this plant-made human IgA1, or if it would limit instead its use in human therapies.

### O-glycosylation of PMPs: risks versus advantages

Many therapeutic proteins present a short serum half-life because of their small size and susceptibility to serum proteases. Several strategies have been developed for the effective long-term stabilization of protein pharmaceuticals. The pharmacological properties of some small proteins are strongly improved after the covalent attachment of polyethylene glycol (PEG) groups to their Lys and His residues. This modification, referred to as PEGylation, increases the apparent size of therapeutic molecules and slows down their renal clearance, which as a result makes them clinically more effective. On the other hand, PEGylation is time consuming and induces extensive heterogeneity requiring further purification of the PEGylated protein, thereby increasing the overall cost of the final product. Furthermore, the increased stability of the protein resulting from PEGylation may in some cases be partly counterbalanced by a reduced bioactivity of the PEGylated product. Finally, there also are safety concerns about the long-term use of PEGylated proteins *in vivo* because of a possible PEG-induced immunogenicity or toxicity resulting from reduced degradation and clearance rate of the protein product.

Figure 8 Proline hydroxylation and hydroxyproline O-glycosylation of human proteins in plant expression systems. (a) Extensive O-glycosylation occurs within a PVPSTPPTPSPSTPPTPS sequence motif of the heavy chain hinge region of human IgA1. In humans, typical mucin-type O-glycans are attached to threonine (T) or serine (S) residues constitutive of this sequence. In maize, extensive-like O-glycosylation of this protein occurs on the same sequence, with up to six Pro residues converted to Hyp and 0–10 Ara residues attached to each Hyp residue (adapted from Karnoup et al., 2005). (b) Repeats of the dipeptide (SP)ₙ, where n = 2, 10, 20, fused to the C-terminal end of human IFNα2. When expressed in BY2 tobacco cells, proline constitutive of the dipeptide repeats in this hybrid protein is hydroxylated and the resulting hydroxyproline residues O-glycosylated, mainly with a 22-residues arabinogalactan oligosaccharide. IFNα2 undergoing plant-specific O-glycosylation shows higher yield and increased serum half-life than the natural version of IFNα2 (adapted from Xu et al., 2007).

models was shown in several studies (Lamport, 1969; Lind et al., 1994; Yates et al., 1996; Willats et al., 1998; Showalter, 2001), and most anti-AGP monoclonal antibodies are known to mainly or exclusively recognize carbohydrate-containing epitopes on these glycoproteins (Yates et al., 1996). It was shown more recently that arabinose linked to Hyp residues in Art v 1, the major allergen of mugwort pollen, constitutes a strong IgG and IgE binding determinant and could contribute to the allergic reaction in humans (Léonard et al., 2005b). Together, these results suggest that plant-specific O-glycosylation could be a source of immunogenicity for plant-made therapeutic proteins, and it is thus surprising that AGP glycomodules fused to IFNα or hGH were not immunogenic when injected in mice (US patent application 20060026719; Xu et al., 2007).

Further studies are now required to determine whether or not the positive impact on yield, half-life and pharmacodynamics of Hyp O-glycosylation on therapeutic proteins expressed in plants would be counterbalanced by an induction of immunogenicity and/or allergenicity in humans.

### Conclusions and future directions

The development of plant platforms dedicated to the production of glycosylated PMPs for parenteral application in humans requires the consideration of both N- and O-glycan-specific glycoepitopes. Ongoing efforts to optimize glycan composition for lower immunogenicity are currently exclusively focused on N-glycans. Indeed, very little attention has been paid until now to the presence of

plant-specific O-glycans on PMPs, although many therapeutic proteins already produced in plant expression systems are very good candidates for Pro hydroxylation and Hyp O-glycosylation, as notably illustrated with human IgA produced in maize (Karnoup et al., 2005).

Engineering *N*-glycosylation in plants could improve the efficiency of PMPs, not only by reducing plant *N*-glycan immunogenicity in humans, but also by providing plant expression systems dedicated to the production of therapeutic protein glycovariants hardly produced at low cost in cultured mammalian cells. For instance, antibodies with high-Man-type *N*-glycans, which show promise for cancer therapy because of their rapid clearance in non-cancerous tissues *in vivo*, can be readily obtained in plant systems using protein retention in the ER or GNTI knockdown, thus providing a possible alternative to Lec 1 mutant CHO cells (Wright and Morrison, 1998). Another illustration for the potential of plant cells in antibody production concerns the so-called antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) process, a lytic attack on antibody-targeted cells considered as a major function of “anti-tumor” therapeutic antibodies. ADCC activity depends on the presence and structure of the *N*-glycans at position Asn-297 on the heavy chains, as illustrated by the enhanced ADCC activity of antibody glycoforms devoid of α1,6 fucose in their *N*-glycan chains (Shields et al., 2002; Shinkawa et al., 2003; Niwa et al., 2005; Ferrara et al., 2006) and the recent development of a stable high-producing CHO glycoengineered cell line for large-scale production of non-fucosylated therapeutic antibodies (Kanda et al., 2006). Interestingly, the lack of α1,3 linked fucose on the *N*-glycans of an antibody produced in duckweeds or Arabidopsis after α1,3 FucT knockout has the same positive effect on ADCC activity as the removal of the α1,6 fucose on an antibody produced in the fucose deficient CHO cell line (Cox et al., 2006; Schähs et al., 2007).

It is also noteworthy that the availability of glycoengineered plants is not required for all PMPs. For instance, *N*-glycans on plant-made human glucocerebrosidase are suitable for enzyme replacement therapy of Gaucher disease, without the need for prior *in vitro* glycan processing as described for glucocerebrosidase produced in CHO cells (Shaaltiel et al., 2007). Plant-specific *N*-glycosylation could also represent a significant advantage in some cases, notably for recombinant vaccine antigens. The promise of plant-made recombinant vaccines has been amply demonstrated in recent years, with more than 200 papers describing the production of vaccines and allergens in plants (Faye and Gomord, 2010), and

the successful development of a Newcastle disease virus vaccine for poultry produced in suspension-cultured tobacco cells, registered and approved by the US Department of Agriculture in January 2006 (Vermij and Waltz, 2006). Besides their acknowledged advantages for fast and high-yield production of parenterally delivered vaccines (see McCormick et al., 2008; D’Aoust et al., 2009; D’Aoust et al., 2010 for recent illustrations), plant expression systems are likely to contribute to a broader use of inexpensive oral vaccines in the future (see Mestecky et al., 2008 and Rybicki, 2009 for recent reviews). To this end, plant-specific strategies have been identified to increase antigen heat stability and resistance to enzymatic digestion in the gastrointestinal tract, including recombinant protein incorporation into biodegradable particles such as lipid or natural or artificial protein bodies (Nochi et al., 2007; http://www.sembiosys.com and http://www.erabiotech.com). Several mucosal adjuvants have also been investigated to enhance the immunogenicity and uptake of plant-made antigens by the intestine for oral vaccination, or alternative routes such as intranasal via mucosal surfaces. The use of plant *N*-glycans as glycoadjuvants and their capacity to bind Man receptors at the surface of antigen-presenting cells, however, has not yet been evaluated *in vivo*, although recent results obtained with a plant-made human glucocerebrosidase have illustrated the capacity of plant *N*-glycans to bind these receptors (Shaaltiel et al., 2007). Recent attempts in our laboratory also proved promising towards the development of plant-specific glycoadjuvants for immunization with plant-made mucosal vaccines. We notably observed that the presence of plant *N*-glycans on a recombinant allergen could represent an advantage in sublingual-specific immunotherapy of allergic diseases (Gomord, V., unpub. data). Altogether, these results indicate that, in addition to their well-described advantages for fast, high yield, low cost and contamination free production of pharmaceutical proteins, plants are now emerging as a powerful expression system for the production of therapeutic protein glycovariants showing similar, or even higher, biological activity than protein homologs expressed in cultured mammalian cells.
