Parathyroid hormone (PTH) has bone anabolic activity when administered intermittently, affecting cells of the osteoblastic lineage at various stages, yet much remains to be learned about precisely how PTH promotes osteoblastic bone formation. Recent discoveries revealed that PTH causes transcriptional suppression of the osteocyte marker gene SOST, which encodes the potent secreted bone formation inhibitor, sclerostin. This review addresses whether osteocytes, terminally differentiated cells of the osteoblastic lineage, which are entrapped within the mineralized bone matrix, contribute to PTH-induced bone formation responses via regulation of sclerostin levels, and discusses recent evidence on how the bone anabolic responses elicited by intermittent PTH treatment or by sclerostin inhibition overlap and diverge.

Intermittent parathyroid hormone (PTH) treatment is bone anabolic, whereas continuous treatment is bone catabolic. PTH is currently the only anabolic bone treatment option for patients with low bone mass conditions such as severe osteoporosis (OP) (Box 1). It has received much attention in recent years because of the finding that intermittent treatment (i.e. daily injection) causes a significant increase in bone mass [1–3]. The intact hormone PTH(1–84) and its N-terminal fragment (1–34) have been developed as treatments for established osteoporosis. Nonetheless, despite PTH being a well-recognized bone forming agent, the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms are to date still only partially understood [4,5].

PTH can generate both anabolic and catabolic net effects on bone mass and density. Intermittent application increases bone mass by enhancing predominantly bone formation, whereas continuous treatment stimulates high bone turnover by osteoclasts and osteoblasts, resulting in net bone loss [4–6]. The PTH/PTH-related peptide type 1 receptor (PTH1R), which is the G protein-coupled receptor through which PTH mediates its action, is expressed in cells of the osteoblastic lineage and in bone marrow stromal cells, lymphocytes and other cell types, indicating a complex regulatory network involving various cell types and molecular interactions. The bone anabolic action of PTH is attributed to its ability to increase osteoblast number by promoting osteoblastic precursor proliferation [7], osteoblast survival and possibly reactivation of quiescent bone lining cells, which are of osteoblastic origin [4–6].

Furthermore, intermittent PTH treatment enhances osteoblast differentiation and activity [4–6]. Microarray gene expression analyses using osteoblastic UMR-106 cells, which express high levels of PTH1R, uncovered a high degree of complexity of PTH-induced gene regulation [8,9]. Over the past few years, several molecules have been identified as important regulators of PTH-mediated bone effects based on mouse genetic approaches, and the list of novel PTH effectors is steadily increasing (Box 2). In addition, PTH-induced increases in bone formation is also partially related to osteoclastic bone resorption [4,5,10–12].

Despite its net bone anabolic action, intermittent PTH administration results in increased bone resorption over time, reflected in humans by increases in serum and urinary bone biomarkers [2,13–15]. The onset of elevated PTH-induced resorption and thus bone turnover is not only linked to PTH exposure duration, but also increases proportionally with the applied PTH dose. The early phases of PTH-induced bone anabolism are marked by activation of quiescent bone surfaces, resulting in expansion of the relative mineralizing bone surface, whereas later events rely more on continued stimulation of existing bone remodeling units and an increase in their activation frequency [2,10].

Continuous PTH treatment leading to sustained elevation of PTH levels increases osteoclast number and activity, causing enhanced bone turnover and concomitant bone loss. This effect is mediated indirectly through bone marrow stromal cells and cells of the osteoblast lineage. All of these express PTH1R and respond to PTH stimulation with changes in cytokine and growth factor expression, which affect bone-resorbing osteoclasts and their precursor cells in a paracrine fashion. Continuous PTH treatment thus results in sustained activation of several genes involved in bone resorption [5,6]. It elevates expression of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) ligand family member RANKL (receptor activator for nuclear factor κB ligand), whereas expression of the secreted RANKL decoy receptor osteoprotegerin (OPG) is not changed in skeletally growing rats [11], but is upregulated in skeletally mature rats [16]. Together these changes reveal presumably persistent increases of the RANKL/OPG ratio, favoring interaction of RANKL with its signaling receptor RANK, which is expressed in osteoclast precursors and mature osteoclasts, thereby leading to enhanced osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption. Interestingly, intermittent PTH treatment also causes a transient rise in RANKL expression, which is followed by an increase in OPG expression, thus allowing a

Review

Box 1. Osteoporosis

Osteoporosis (OP) is a systemic skeletal disorder characterized by low bone mass and microarchitectural deterioration of bone tissue with a consequent increase in bone fragility and susceptibility to fracture [57]. OP is associated with a disturbed remodeling balance of the coupled activity of bone resorbing osteoclasts and bone forming osteoblasts, resulting in a net decrease in bone mineral density (BMD) [58,59]. Although vertebral and wrist fractures are most frequent in OP, hip fractures are the most dangerous type of OP fractures to the patient. In fact, 11–34% of patients experiencing a hip fracture die within the first year after injury [60]. Most OP therapies are based on inhibition of bone catabolic osteoclastic resorption, hence preventing further bone loss, but only indirectly increasing bone mass with time in a moderate fashion. These treatments reduce the risk of new vertebral fractures by up to 70%, but only reduce the risk of hip fractures by a maximum of about 40% [61,62]. Moreover, many patients with OP have already lost a substantial amount of bone at the time of diagnosis. Consequently, there is a need for anabolic therapies that actively increase bone mass by stimulating new bone formation as opposed to antiresorptive treatments that merely stop further bone loss.

They reside within lacunae, small cavities within the mineralized bone matrix, and extend long, thin cellular protrusions termed dendrites, which travel inside the mineralized bone through channels (canaliculi) that also reach to the bone surface. Osteocytes are connected through the canalicular network with each other and with cells at the bone surface including osteoblasts, bone lining cells and possibly osteoclasts. They form gap junctions with neighboring cells. Thus, osteocytes generate a complex cellular network throughout the skeleton that appears well-suited for integration of local and systemic signals to ensure skeletal integrity and bone homeostasis [17,18].

Osteocytes not only express PTH1R [4], but were also recently found to selectively express SOST [19,20], which encodes sclerostin, a secreted glycoprotein that inhibits bone formation (Figure 1). Transgenic mice overexpressing human SOST exhibit a low bone mass phenotype [21]. Conversely, constitutive Sost knockout (KO) mice display a progressive high bone mass phenotype and increased bone strength [22–24]. Patients afflicted by sclerosteosis (OMIM269500) and van Buchem disease (VBD; OMIM 239100) display lifelong massive bone overgrowth with increased BMD and bone strength, caused by lack of sclerostin protein [19]. In sclerosteosis, this is attributable to mutations in SOST, whereas VBD patients lack a 52 kb non-coding region 35 kb downstream of the gene that contains an enhancer element implicated in adult SOST expression [19,21] (Figure 1).

Based on amino acid sequence similarity to members of the DAN/Cerberus family of cystine knot-containing secreted glycoproteins, sclerostin was originally believed to act as a bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) antagonist in bone [19,25], and in fact was shown to weakly bind BMPs and inhibit BMP signaling [19,25]. However, subsequent *in vitro* studies demonstrated that sclerostin binds to low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) 5 and 6, which function as co-receptors for secreted Wingless-type MMTV integration site (Wnt) ligands [26,27]. Currently, it is thought that sclerostin passes through the osteocytic canalicular network to access the bone surface, where it inhibits osteoblastic canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling, which is implicated in bone mass regulation [28]. This hypothesis is supported by the phenotypic overlap between human bone overgrowth disorders related to SOST loss-of-function mutations and LRP5 gain-of-function mutations, and by the observation that sclerostin binding is decreased to mutated forms of LRP5 that cause the high bone mass phenotype [29,30]. However, conclusive *in vivo* proof for this hypothesis is currently still lacking, especially after the recent unanticipated finding that Lrp5 might not act as a local Wnt signaling mediator in bone, but rather might control preosteoblast proliferation indirectly by inhibiting peripheral serotonin synthesis in the duodenum [31]. Likewise, it has not been formally proven whether sclerostin exerts its action by targeting osteoblasts as a paracrine factor; it might well affect osteocyte function in an autocrine manner. In fact, recent evidence suggests that sclerostin partly affects osteocytes, as loss of Sost function in mice results in decreased osteocyte apoptosis [24]. Furthermore, it cannot be excluded that low levels of sclerostin entering the circulation might have additional roles.

brief transient stimulation of osteoclast activity [11]. Owing to coupling of osteoclast and osteoblast activity, a temporary increase in osteoclast action is thought to trigger osteoblast activation, hence contributing to the well-known ability of PTH to activate skeletal remodeling.

In summary, a net positive or negative outcome of PTH administration on bone mass depends on the kinetics of PTH exposure, treatment duration and applied dose. All of these affect the relative ability and extent by which PTH activates skeletal modeling versus remodeling, and osteoblastic bone formation versus osteoclastic bone resorption. Only in situations where bone formation exceeds bone resorption can net bone gain be achieved.

Osteocytes express PTH1R and secrete the bone formation inhibitor, sclerostin

Osteoblasts differentiate from mesenchymal bone marrow progenitor cells into bone forming cells that reside on the bone surface and deposit new bone matrix. A small fraction of osteoblasts further differentiates into osteocytes, terminally differentiated cells of the osteoblastic lineage, which represent >90% of all bone cells in the adult skeleton [17].

Box 2. Genes involved in PTH bone anabolic action

Several molecules have been genetically linked to PTH action *in vivo*. So far, the transcription factors c-fos [5], core binding factor alpha 1/run related transcription factor 2 (Cbfa1/Runx2) [4–6], cAMP responsive element modulator (CREM) [63] and activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) [64] have been established as important regulators of PTH bone anabolic action. In addition, members of the insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-1) signaling pathway [65,66], fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) [67] and the cytokine interleukin-18 (IL18) [68] are required for PTH-induced bone anabolism. Moreover, β-arrestin2, a cytoplasmic adaptor/scaffold protein regulating receptor function, is implicated in mediating bone responses to intermittent and continuous PTH treatment [69,70]. Furthermore, mice selectively lacking connexin 43 (Cx43; the principal component of gap junctions) in osteoblasts and osteocytes display attenuated PTH-induced bone anabolism, suggesting that direct intercellular communication among and between osteoblasts and osteocytes is important for PTH-induced bone formation [71]. Finally, T lymphocytes have recently emerged as important regulatory modulators of PTH bone anabolic action through paracrine Wnt10b signaling [72].

by *in silico* searches, which might contribute to *Sost* expression regulation by MEF2 factors [36].

MEF2 proteins are well known for their function in muscle cell differentiation and as regulators of neuronal and immune cell differentiation and function [37]. Only relatively recently, MEF2C was reported to play a role in chondrocyte hypertrophy and early bone development, implying a role for this transcription factor in skeletal biology [38]. *MEF2A*, *C* and *D* are coexpressed in osteocytes and rat osteosarcoma derived UMR-106 cells, and affect *Sost* expression and probably other osteocyte-specific genes [35,36]. Although related Ros17/2.8 rat osteosarcoma cells express *MEF2s* at comparable levels to UMR-106 cells, they express *Sost* at considerably lower levels, suggesting that *MEF2s* alone are not sufficient for high *Sost* expression levels [32]. Given the widespread expression of these transcription factors, determining the requirement of individual MEF2 members will require the generation of osteocyte-specific conditional KO mice.

Overall, data so far suggest that PTH suppresses MEF2-stimulated *Sost* bone enhancer activity and thus osteocytic sclerostin levels. However, the precise underlying molecular mechanisms await further investigation, as a plethora of signaling pathways has been shown to control transcriptional activity of MEF2s [37]. These *in vitro* findings raise the question of whether osteocytes contribute to PTH-induced bone formation responses via regulation of sclerostin levels.

PTH suppresses osteocytic *Sost* expression

The localization and abundance of osteocytes within bone, their expression of PTH1R and their ability to secrete the potent bone formation inhibitor sclerostin indicate their potential role as important regulators of bone formation. This hypothesis is supported by the findings that PTH suppresses *Sost* transcription *in vitro* [32,33]. Moreover, PTH treatment decreases *Sost* expression *in vivo* [32–34], resulting in fewer numbers of osteocytes expressing sclerostin [33,34]. *Sost* expression was suppressed by continuous PTH treatment [33] and reduced following short- and long-term intermittent treatment [32]. As suppression was transient during short-term intermittent treatment, continuous suppression of *Sost* might not necessarily be required for anabolism.

PTH-induced *Sost* downregulation is direct and is mediated via the intracellular cAMP signaling pathway [32]. *In vitro*, PTH appears to exert its effects on *Sost* expression at least partly via the remote bone enhancer present in the region deleted downstream of the *Sost* gene in patients with VBD [21,35] (Figure 1). Transcriptional regulation by cAMP signaling is conferred by PKA-dependent phosphorylation of cAMP responsive element binding protein (CREB) transcription factors and family members, which bind to cAMP responsive elements (CREs). However, no CRE was found within the *Sost* bone enhancer. Instead, this enhancer contains a myocyte enhancer factor (MEF2) response element, essential for activity [35]. MEF2 transcription factors bind to this response element *in vitro* and appear to mediate PTH responsiveness of the *Sost* bone enhancer [35] (Figure 1). In addition, 18 conserved MEF2 sites have recently been identified in the 5 kb *Sost* promoter region

PTH-induced *Sost* inhibition contributes to PTH bone anabolic action *in vivo*

Recently, the role of PTH signaling in osteocytes *in vivo* was addressed in mice overexpressing a constitutively active PTH1R variant selectively in osteocytes, mimicking part of the effects triggered by continuous systemic PTH exposure [39]. In these mice, *Sost* expression is suppressed by about 80% and consistently, the number of sclerostin positive osteocytes is dramatically reduced. These mice further display a bone overgrowth phenotype characterized by elevated bone turnover caused by increased osteoblastic and osteoclastic activity, consistent with the hypothesis that the anabolic action of PTH on bone might in part be mediated by PTH-induced suppression of *Sost*.

To further address the *in vivo* relevance of *Sost* suppression for PTH-induced bone gain, we used genetically engineered mouse models with altered *Sost* expression levels [21,23]. We subjected moderately osteopenic *SOST* transgenic (*SOST Tg*) mice [21] [expressing human *SOST* from a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) transgene containing the human *SOST* promoter and downstream bone enhancer] to anabolic intermittent PTH treatment. At the transcriptional level, PTH downregulated transgenic human *SOST* expression in a similar way to endogenous mouse *Sost*, suggesting evolutionary conservation of PTH-induced suppression of *Sost* from mouse to human. Despite the reduction in transgene expression levels, PTH-induced relative bone gain and bone formation were attenuated in *SOST Tg* mice. The observed blunting of PTH-induced bone gain in these mice is therefore most likely caused

by overall higher net sclerostin protein levels in SOST Tg mice, but the fact that the transgene was responsive to PTH makes the data difficult to interpret conclusively. In this respect, a mouse model expressing a SOST transgene whose expression is not altered by PTH might be of interest. However, constitutive expression of high SOST levels would worsen the osteopenia. This by itself affects the analysis of PTH-induced bone anabolism in SOST Tg mice, at least in the cancellous bone compartment, because the *in vivo* efficacy of PTH-induced bone gain has been shown to decline with reduced cancellous bone mass [4].

We next analyzed PTH-induced bone anabolism in mice lacking *Sost* expression constitutively [23]. *Sost* KO mice display high bone mass caused by increased osteoblast numbers, and thus increased bone forming surfaces together with elevated osteoblastic bone-matrix apposition [22–24]. If bone anabolic pathways inhibited by *Sost* action and activated by intermittent PTH treatment were non-overlapping, additive effects of PTH-induced bone anabolism and *Sost* loss-of-function dependent bone gain would have occurred. Instead, PTH-induced bone gain was severely reduced in *Sost* KO mice, consistent with a role for *Sost* suppression downstream of PTH signaling. At the tissue level, PTH bone anabolic action relies on increases in the extent of bone forming surfaces and bone matrix apposition rates [4,6]. Both aspects were affected by loss of *Sost* function. As bone forming surfaces are already increased under basal conditions in *Sost* deficient mice, it cannot be fully excluded that the observed blunting of PTH-induced bone gain was partly due to a putative inherent saturation point of osteoblastic bone formation that could have been already reached at baseline. To definitely exclude this possibility, it would be necessary to apply to *Sost* KO mice a bone anabolic control stimulus, which activates pathways independent of *Sost* or PTH action. Although attenuated, PTH treatment was still able to increase the osteoblastic mineral apposition rate in *Sost* KO mice, indicating that bone formation had not yet reached the terminal saturation point. This finding also demonstrates that, in addition to activating bone anabolic pathways that are normally inhibited by *Sost* and thus are increased upon *Sost* suppression, PTH must induce other anabolic pathways whose molecular components will need to be uncovered by future studies.

The data obtained so far in transgenic mouse models consistently suggest that the PTH downstream target *Sost* contributes to PTH-induced bone gain *in vivo*, implicating osteocytes in mediating bone mass changes elicited by PTH. However, each of the studies described above has its limitations. Osteocyte-specific overexpression of constitutively active PTH1R aimed at elucidating the specific role of PTH1R signaling in osteocytes is flawed by the artificial nature of continuous receptor activation, which probably does not fully reproduce normal intra- and intercellular signaling events occurring with continuous or intermittent PTH exposure. Similarly, BAC transgenic mice overexpressing *SOST* are not ideal for addressing unquestionably the relevance of *Sost* downregulation for PTH-induced bone anabolism, because the transgene was responsive to PTH, complicating the interpretation of the observed blunting of PTH-induced bone anabolism in these mice. Similarly, the question of whether PTH bone ana-

![Figure 2. Crosstalk of PTH/PTH1R and Wnt signaling pathways. (a) Canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling is initiated by binding of Wnt ligands to the Frizzled (Fzd)-Lrp5/6 receptor complex causing activation of dishevelled (Dvl) followed by recruitment of the scaffold protein axin to Lrp5/6 co-receptors at the cell membrane. This inactivates the β-catenin degradation complex consisting of the scaffold proteins axin and adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) and the protein kinases casein kinase 1 (CK1) and glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3), thereby relieving β-catenin (Ctnnb1) from its constant phosphorylation by CK1 and GSK3 and its subsequent degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. β-catenin can thus accumulate in the cytosol and translocate to the nucleus where it associates with members of the T cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor (TCF/Lef) family of transcription factors to function as a transcriptional co-activator activating transcription of canonical Wnt/β-catenin target genes such as osteoprotegerin (Opg). The secreted Wnt signaling antagonists Wnt inhibitory factor 1 (Wif1) and Secreted frizzled-related proteins (Sfrps) prevent activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling by sequestering Wnt ligands, whereas inhibitory Dickkopf homolog (Dkk) family members and sclerostin block canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling by binding to Lrp5/6 Wnt-co-receptors preventing their association with the Wnt/Fzd complex. (b) Binding of PTH to PTH1R induces association of the PTH-PTH1R complex with the extracellular domain of the Lrp6 Wnt co-receptor in absence of Wnt ligand binding. This results in rapid phosphorylation of Lrp6 by PKA, which is activated by the cAMP signaling pathway downstream of PTH-PTH1R. Phosphorylated Lrp6 recruits axin and thereby targets the β-catenin degradation complex to the cell membrane. β-catenin (Ctnnb1) can thus accumulate in the cytosol and translocate to the nucleus, then, together with members of the T cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor (TCF/Lef) family of transcription factors, activate Wnt/β-catenin target gene transcription. Binding of the secreted Wnt antagonists, sclerostin or Dkk1, to the extracellular domain of Lrp6 prevents induction of Wnt/β-catenin target gene transcription by PTH-PTH1R signaling.

bolic action was decreased in *Sost*-deficient mice by the elevated bone anabolic status present in these mice under basal conditions cannot be easily resolved.

In the future, inducible deletion of *PTH1R* selectively in osteocytes of skeletally mature mice should shed more

light on the role of osteocytes in mediating PTH-induced bone changes. Likewise, PTH treatment of inducible loss- or gain-of-function mice in which Sost could be ablated or overexpressed concomitantly to treatment onset would be a way to further study the relevance of Sost suppression for PTH action *in vivo*. Finally it would be of interest to investigate whether Sost heterozygous mice, which do not present with an equally dramatic increase in bone formation to homozygous mice, also display altered bone formation responses to PTH.

### PTH signaling activates canonical Wnt signaling

Transgenic mice selectively expressing constitutively active PTH1R in osteocytes display decreased Sost expression and increased canonical Wnt signaling [39]. As described, sclerostin is currently speculated to function as a secreted inhibitor of canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling by binding to Lrp5 and Lrp6 Wnt co-receptors, preventing their association with the Wnt-Frizzled (Fzd) receptor complex [28] (*Figure 2a*). Interestingly, simultaneous deletion of *Lrp5* abolished the increased bone mass resulting from osteocyte-specific overexpression of constitutively active PTH1R, whereas bone turnover remained elevated [39]. Thus, *Lrp5* is specifically required for bone mass gain induced by constitutive PTH1R signaling in osteocytes, whereas it is dispensable for osteocyte PTH1R-induced elevated bone turnover. Whether loss of *Lrp5* function in this mouse model was related to a reversal of activated canonical Wnt signaling, however, remains to be demonstrated.

Similar to PTH treatment, mechanical loading, which stimulates bone anabolic responses to adapt to the increased mechanical needs impinging on the skeleton, causes local suppression of osteocytic sclerostin levels and increases canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling [40–42]. This suggests that bone anabolic pathways activated by PTH signaling and mechanical loading might partially overlap (*Box 3*). The role of canonical Wnt signaling in PTH-induced bone anabolism has been previously addressed *in vivo* [9, 43, 44]. Although *Lrp5*-deficient mice display osteopenia, bone gain induced by intermittent PTH treatment was largely unaltered in two independent *Lrp5* KO mouse strains [43, 44]. This agrees with a recent report suggesting that *Lrp5* is not required in bone as a local Wnt co-receptor, but rather functions in the duodenum to suppress peripheral serotonin synthesis [31]. Alternatively, *Lrp5* might be dispensable for PTH-induced bone anabolism because of functional compensation by *Lrp6*, a hypothesis favored by our group. Indeed, accumulating evidence suggests that *Lrp5* and *Lrp6* display both partly overlapping and distinct functions in bone metabolism [45, 46]. Thus, future studies using conditional KO mice are needed to specifically address the role of *Lrp6* and its potential redundancy with *Lrp5* in PTH-induced bone anabolism *in vivo*.

Besides Sost, PTH differentially regulates the expression of several other secreted Wnt signaling antagonists (*Box 4*). Finally, *in vitro* and *in vivo* evidence suggests direct cross-talk of PTH1R and Wnt signaling pathways [47–49] (*Figure 2b*). Recent work indicates that the activated PTH-PTH1R complex associates with the extracellular

**Box 3. Mechanical load regulates osteocytic sclerostin levels**

Mechanical loading results in increased bone formation at skeletal sites that experience increased mechanical strain, whereas unloading decreases bone formation locally, representing adaptive responses of the skeleton thought to be mediated by osteocytes [18]. Interestingly, similar to PTH treatment, mechanical loading locally decreases osteocytic sclerostin levels and results in increased canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling [40–42]. Conversely, *Sost* is upregulated by skeletal unloading, which correlates with a decrease in canonical Wnt/β-catenin target gene expression [24, 40]. Correspondingly, *Sost*-deficient mice are resistant to unloading-induced bone loss and do not display decreased Wnt/β-catenin signaling upon skeletal unloading [24]. Moreover, intermittent PTH treatment prevents unloading-induced bone loss in skeletally mature rats, at least temporarily [73]. Recently, periosteal upregulation of periostin (*Postn*) has been demonstrated to be required for mechanical strain-induced suppression of *Sost in vivo* [74]. Interestingly, continuous PTH treatment induces progressive increases in *Postn* expression, suggesting that *Postn* might contribute to sustained suppression of *Sost* [11, 16]. It will be interesting to determine the role of *Postn* in PTH-induced bone mass changes in future studies. In addition, *Lrp5* was reported to be essential for bone anabolism induced by mechanical loading, although it is dispensable for PTH-induced bone gain [43, 44]. Thus, mechanical stimulation and bone anabolic PTH action appear to activate both common and distinct signaling pathways. Concomitant mechanical loading and intermittent PTH treatment synergistically augment bone anabolic responses at skeletal sites exposed to elevated mechanical strain [42, 75, 76]. However, it remains to be addressed whether the observed synergism is due to increased or prolonged downregulation of *Sost* and potentiated Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Moreover, although mechanical loading and short-term intermittent PTH treatment result in lamellar bone formation, when applied separately, concomitant application can induce woven bone formation depending on the respective skeletal site [75]. By contrast, woven bone has not been described in *Sost*-deficient mice or patients. Together, it appears that *Sost* suppression by PTH treatment or mechanical loading contributes to either bone anabolic principle, but additional regulatory pathways clearly seem to be involved.

domain of Lrp6, triggering PKA-dependent phosphorylation of Lrp6, which recruits axin to Lrp6 at the plasma membrane [49]. This in turn stabilizes β-catenin and activates β-catenin-dependent Wnt reporter transcription independent of Wnt-Fzd interaction. Moreover, binding of sclerostin to the extracellular domain of Lrp6 prevents PTH-dependent Wnt/β-catenin reporter gene activation, thus providing a putative additional mechanism as to why PTH-induced transient suppression of *Sost* might be required for the full bone anabolic action of PTH.

Taken together, current evidence strongly indicates a direct relationship between PTH signaling and the canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway (*Figure 2b*). Constitutive activation of canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling in osteoblasts leads to increased bone mass *in vivo* due to decreased osteoclast differentiation caused by a reduction in RANKL/OPG ratio induced by increased OPG expression [50, 51]. It is hence tempting to speculate that the temporary rise in OPG expression following PTH-dependent upregulation of RANKL is induced by activation of canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling, which in turn terminates transient stimulation of osteoclast activity. However, several *in vitro* and *in vivo* studies independently revealed activation of canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling following both intermittent and continuous PTH treatment. Nevertheless, only

Box 4. PTH regulation of secreted Wnt signaling antagonists

Similar to the findings in Sost KO mice [23], deletion of the Wnt signaling antagonist secreted frizzled-related protein 1 (Sfrp1) attenuates PTH-induced cancellous bone gain *in vivo*, suggesting that activation of Wnt signaling contributes to PTH bone anabolic action [77]. Furthermore, BAC transgenic overexpression of *Sfrp1* attenuates the initial bone anabolic response in skeletally growing mice after 3 weeks of intermittent PTH treatment [78]. As bone histomorphometric analyses were only partially reported in these studies, it is unclear whether the observed blunting of PTH-induced bone gain was primarily due to reduced increases in mineralizing bone surface or to diminished upregulation of osteoblastic mineral apposition rate. In addition, PTH differentially regulates the expression of several other secreted Wnt signaling inhibitors. Whereas *Sfrp2* expression is suppressed by intermittent PTH treatment, it is upregulated by continuous PTH exposure, similar to *Sfrp4*, which was found to be upregulated following both intermittent and continuous PTH application *in vitro* and *in vivo* [8,11,16]. Conversely, *dickkopf homolog 1 (Dkk1)* [9,79] and *Wnt inhibitory factor 1 (Wif1)* [11,79] are consistently downregulated by continuous and intermittent PTH treatment. In contrast to sclerostin and Dkk proteins, which antagonize Wnt signaling by binding to Lrp5 and Lrp6 co-receptors, Sfrps and Wif-1 inhibit Wnt signaling by directly sequestering Wnt ligands, preventing receptor association. Therefore, Sfrps and Wif-1 might display ligand specificity, and in addition to targeting canonical Wnt signaling, might also inhibit non-canonical Wnt signaling.

intermittent PTH application is bone anabolic. Moreover, constitutively active PTH1R signaling in osteocytes induces high bone turnover despite persistent suppression of *Sost* expression by about 80% and independent of *Lrp5* function [39]. Similarly, PTH-induced changes in *Rankl* and *Opg* expression do not appear to correlate with *Sost* suppression [52]. Therefore, additional regulatory factors and/or signaling pathways are probably activated by continuous PTH exposure and prolonged intermittent PTH treatment, which alter the initial response to intermittent PTH exposure from a transient short-term to a sustained osteoclastogenic stimulus. This results in elevated bone turnover independent of canonical Wnt signaling. Thus, much work remains to be done to untangle the complex signaling networks and molecular interactions of PTH–Wnt signaling crosstalk.

Intermittent PTH treatment and sclerostin inhibition: two converging and diverging bone anabolic principles

It is worth pointing out that bone anabolism induced by intermittent PTH treatment or sclerostin inhibition overlap in several, but not in all aspects. The bone forming effects of an anti-sclerostin antibody in rodents [53] resemble in some ways those of high-dose intermittent PTH treatment [54]. Either anabolic agent increases both the extent of bone forming surfaces and osteoblastic bone matrix synthesis. Likewise, all skeletal envelopes respond to bone anabolic intermittent PTH treatment and to sclerostin inhibition with bone apposition. However, those adjacent to bone marrow, namely the endocortical and cancellous bone envelope, are most responsive to PTH treatment, whereas the outer subperiosteal envelope appears somewhat less reactive [55]. This might relate to a requirement of resorptive activity for a full PTH bone anabolic effect [10–12], which is mediated in part by mechanisms based on bone remodeling that predominate at bone envelopes adjacent to marrow [56]. Inhibition of sclerostin results in robust bone forming responses at subperiosteal bone surfaces, with only a minor prevalence of endocortical and cancellous bone effects observed [53]. Notably, increases in bone formation induced by an anti-sclerostin antibody are not associated with increases in bone resorption; in fact, a reduction in osteoclast number was described at least after short-term treatment [53]. However, it is unclear whether this reduction was due to a direct inhibition of osteoclastogenesis caused by inhibition of sclerostin function or merely reflects a secondary consequence of the sudden vast increase in bone forming surfaces. Together, data obtained so far from mice with altered *Sost* expression levels and from sclerostin-deficient patients have not revealed a major role for *Sost* in regulation of osteoclastogenesis or bone resorption [19,21–23]. Therefore, a putative direct or indirect effect of sclerostin on bone resorption requires further investigation. For short-term intermittent PTH treatment, uncoupling of bone resorption and formation and direct modeling-based activation of bone formation have also been demonstrated [2]. Yet, longer-term intermittent treatment is clearly characterized by increases in bone resorption and bone remodeling [2,10,14]. Current findings suggest that bone anabolism induced by sclerostin inhibition is not associated with a concomitant increase in bone resorption and that it is not linked to elevated bone remodeling opposed to some PTH effects.

Concluding remarks

PTH exerts complex and only partially elucidated cellular and molecular actions in bone, directly affecting bone marrow stromal cells and osteoblasts at all stages of their life cycle. In addition, PTH indirectly regulates osteoclast differentiation and activity through cells of the osteoblastic lineage via various paracrine cytokines and growth factors. Recent studies in mice demonstrate that bone anabolic pathways induced by PTH or sclerostin inhibition partially overlap, because loss or gain of *Sost* function significantly reduces PTH-induced bone anabolism *in vivo* [23]. Nonetheless, some differences exist between the mode of bone anabolic responses elicited by intermittent PTH treatment and inhibition of osteocyte derived sclerostin. In addition to stimulating modeling responses, PTH induces bone gain by activating bone remodeling, which does not occur with *Sost* loss-of-function mutations [19,21–23]. In fact, inhibition of sclerostin function appears to partially uncouple bone formation and resorption in mice and humans lacking sclerostin and in rodents after short-term anti-sclerostin antibody treatment. However, long-term effects of antibody-mediated inhibition of sclerostin on bone turnover still need to be addressed. It will also be interesting to explore the effect of combined anti-sclerostin antibody and intermittent PTH treatment on bone modeling and remodeling, respectively. Although suppression of *Sost* contributes to PTH-induced bone gain, down-regulation of *Sost* as observed with continuous [33] and long-term [37] PTH treatment is neither required nor sufficient to prevent high bone turnover and remodeling.

Review

Trends in Endocrinology and Metabolism Vol.21 No.4

Therefore, additional signaling pathways must determine the outcome of the net effect of PTH on bone mass; thus the quest for identifying novel genes and mechanisms involved in PTH action is still ongoing.

In summary, suppression of osteocytic Sost appears to be implicated in PTH-induced bone gain. Although several open questions remain to be carefully addressed by future studies, current findings identify osteocytes as mediators of bone mass changes elicited by PTH [39]. More osteocyte-specific targeted KO mouse models will be required to better define the relative significance of these cells in PTH-induced bone changes and the implicated underlying molecular mechanisms, of which Sost regulation is probably only one. In particular, inducible deletion of PTH1R selectively in osteocytes of skeletally mature mice should provide crucial insights in this respect.
