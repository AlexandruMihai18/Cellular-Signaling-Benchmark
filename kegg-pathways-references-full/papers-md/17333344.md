## Abstract  
Folates play a key role in one-carbon metabolism essential for the biosynthesis of purines, thymidylate and hence DNA replication. The antifolate methotrexate has been rationally-designed nearly 60 years ago to potently block the folate-dependent enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) thereby achieving temporary remissions in childhood acute leukemia. Recently, the novel antifolates raltitrexed and pemetrexed that target thymidylate synthase (TS) and glycineamide ribonucleotide transformylase (GARTF) were introduced for the treatment of colorectal cancer and malignant pleural mesothelioma. (Anti)folates are divalent anions which predominantly use the reduced folate carrier (RFC) for their cellular uptake. (Anti)folates are retained intracellularly via polyglutamylation catalyzed by folylpoly-γ-glutamate synthetase (FPGS). As the intracellular concentration of antifolates is critical for their pharmacologic activity, polyglutamylation is a key determinant of antifolate cytotoxicity. However, anticancer drug resistance phenomena pose major obstacles towards curative cancer chemotherapy. Pre-clinical and clinical studies have identified a plethora of mechanisms of antifolate-resistance; these are frequently associated with qualitative and/or quantitative alterations in influx and/or efflux transporters of (anti)folates as well as in folate-dependent enzymes. These include inactivating mutations and/or down-regulation of the RFC and various alterations in the target enzymes DHFR, TS and FPGS. Furthermore, it has been recently shown that members of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily including multidrug resistance proteins (MRP/ABCC) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP/ABCG2) are low affinity, high capacity ATP-driven (anti)folate efflux transporters. This transport activity is in addition to their established facility to extrude multiple cytotoxic agents. Hence, by actively extruding antifolates, overexpressed MRPs and/or BCRP confer antifolate resistance. Moreover, down-regulation of MRPs and/or BCRP results in decreased folate efflux thereby leading to expansion of the intracellular folate pool and antifolate resistance. This chapter reviews and discusses the panoply of molecular modalities of antifolate-resistance in preclinical tumor cell systems *in vitro* and *in vivo* as well as in cancer patients. Currently emerging novel strategies for the overcoming of antifolate-resistance are presented. Finally, experimental evidence is provided that the identification and characterization of the molecular mechanisms of antifolate-resistance may prove instrumental in the future development of rationally-based novel antifolates and strategies that could conceivably overcome drug-resistance phenomena.

## 1 Introduction

### 1.1 Folate metabolism  

Prokaryotes and plants possess the biochemical capacity to synthesize their own folate cofactors [1]. In contrast, mammals are devoid of 5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolate (THF) cofactor biosynthesis and hence must obtain them from the diet. In this respect, plants are key sources of dietary
folates for humans. THF cofactors are essential vitamins, of which the most familiar form is folic acid commonly used in multivitamin formulations and food fortification. Folic acid is an oxidized and stable folate form that is efficiently reduced by the normal bacterial flora in the intestine and is not present in appreciable amounts in the blood. Naturally occurring folates are composed of three structural components: a pteridine ring system, a p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) and a glutamate moiety (Fig. 1). In eukaryotes, folate metabolism occurs in two cellular compartments, in the cytosol and in mitochondria (Fig. 2). The distribution of THF coenzymes and folate cofactor-dependent enzymes in these compartments reflects the necessities for one-carbon metabolism in each organelle. Folate coenzymes in the cytosol are involved in the biosynthesis of purines and thymidylate as well as in methyl group biosynthesis, whereas, folates residing in mitochondria are required for glycine metabolism and mitochondrial DNA-encoded protein synthesis [2]. Mitochondrial folates originate from the cytosol and are transported into this organelle presumably in the monoglutamate form by the mitochondrial folate transporter (MFT) [3]. In the cytosol, THF cofactors function as donors of one-carbon units in a series of interconnected metabolic pathways involving de novo biosynthesis of purines and thymidylate, amino acids (methionine, serine and glycine), catabolism of histidine and formic acid, as well as methyl group metabolism including CpG island methylation of DNA (Fig. 2) [1]. Reduced folate derivatives including 10-formyl-THF (10-CHO-THF) contribute one-carbon units in two key de novo formyltransferase reactions involved in the de novo biosynthesis of purines. The first enzyme, glycinamide ribonucleotide transformylase (GARTF), is involved in the formation of the imidazole ring of purines, whereas the more downstream reaction mediated by 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide transformylase (AICARTF) yields the purine intermediate inosine 5′-monophosphate (IMP), also known as inosinic acid (Fig. 2). One important aim of the biosynthesis of IMP is to serve as a tightly regulated intermediate branch point for the balanced formation of the purine nucleotides AMP and GMP. Furthermore, 5,10-methylene-THF (5,10-CH₂-THF), is another important THF coenzyme which functions as a crucial cofactor for the enzyme thymidylate synthase (TS). TS catalyzes the formation of thymidine monophosphate (dTMP) from dUMP. TS transfers a one-carbon unit at the methylene level of oxidation (i.e. from 5,10-CH₂-THF) and reduces it to the methyl level. Hence, collectively, these folate-dependent enzymes are responsible for the de novo provision of purine and thymine nucleotides essential for DNA synthesis. 7,8-Dihydrofolic acid (DHF), the byproduct of TS-dependent activity is then efficiently reduced at the pyrazine part of the pteridine (Fig. 1) to form THF via

an NADPH-dependent reduction mediated by the key and abundant enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) (Fig. 2). This reaction represents an important stage in the recycling of THF cofactors which are further interconverted enzymatically to the various one-carbon donors thereby forming a cyclic system.

### 1.2 Antifolates and their mode of action

The 4-amino folic acid analogue aminopterin as well as its homologue 4-amino-10-methylfolic acid, methotrexate (MTX) (Fig. 1) were the first class of antimetabolites to be introduced to the oncology clinic for the chemotherapeutic treatment of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) nearly 60 years ago [4]; indeed, temporary remissions were achieved in children with ALL. Rationally-designed, novel generation antifolates (some examples shown in Fig. 1) were developed which include potent TS inhibitors such as raltitrexed (Tomudex; ZD1694) [5] recently approved for the treatment of advanced colorectal cancer [6], as well as pemetrexed (Alimta; MTA, LY231514) [7] recently introduced for the treatment of malignant pleural mesothelioma [8] and non-small cell lung cancer [9]. Moreover, antifolates are important components of different chemotherapeutic regimens currently used for the treatment of other human malignancies including osteosarcoma, breast cancer, primary central nervous system lymphoma, choriocarcinoma and gestational trophoblastic neoplasia [10, 11].

Although introduced in 1948 to inhibit the key folate-dependent enzyme DHFR [4], the precise mechanism of action and cytotoxicity of aminopterin and MTX has been neither easily nor rapidly deciphered. Only after 2–3 additional decades were the kinetics of the interaction between MTX and DHFR identified and profoundly understood. Once taken up into cells via a specific transport system (see below), antifolates block key enzymes in folate metabolism, thereby resulting in disruption of purine and thymidylate biosynthesis, inhibition of DNA replication and cell death (Fig. 3). Aminopterin and MTX are excellent inhibitors of DHFR; the potent cytotoxic activity of MTX is a reflection of its extremely tight binding and consequent inhibition of the target enzyme DHFR (Ki=5 pM) [12–14]. Likewise, potent inhibition of other folate-dependent enzymes including TS and AICARTF by certain congeners of MTX also leads to the disruption of purine and pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthesis, thereby resulting in cessation of DNA synthesis and cell death. One of the best studied mechanisms of antifolate cytotoxicity is that of MTX and other 4-amino-folate inhibitors of DHFR. Thus, whereas MTX potently inhibits DHFR with a Ki at the pM range [12–14], a free intracellular MTX level of at least 1 μM is required in order to attain a complete suppression

of DHFR activity and cessation of THF formation in living cells as also corroborated by computer simulations [15–18]. Thus, nearly six orders of magnitude higher MTX concentrations than its Ki for DHFR are required to completely block the catalytic activity of this enzyme. The basis for this apparent discrepancy between DHFR inhibition in a cell-free system versus the enzyme residing in the cytoplasm of living cells was resolved experimentally [19–22]. DHFR activity in mammalian cells is very high when compared to the specific activity of TS. Consequently, DHF, the byproduct of TS activity (Figs. 2, 3), is maintained at a very low intracellular level of ~10 nM [23]. As the Km of DHF for DHFR is in the range of 1 μM, this enzyme functions much below substrate saturation; that is,

Fig. 2 Cellular folate metabolism and its compartmentalization in the cytosol and mitochondria

only a small fraction of cytosolic DHFR activity is sufficient to fulfill the cellular need for THF cofactors. However, once cells are exposed to MTX, and MTX tightly binds its high affinity target enzyme DHFR, DHF accumulates and thus binds MTX-free enzyme molecules. Initially, this DHF association with DHFR molecules maintains a constant rate of THF production. However, once the rapid build up of intracellular DHF achieves a 1,000-fold increase from 10 nM to 10 μM, DHF efficiently competes with MTX for the small fraction of free DHFR molecules that are so crucial for sustaining sufficient THF levels. For this reason, the complete suppression of this small fraction of free DHFR molecules requires relatively high levels of intracellular MTX in order to achieve an efficient competition with the high affinity and highly accumulated substrate, DHF [20–22]. In contrast to this competitive interaction between DHF and MTX at the level of the target enzyme DHFR, once the polyanionic MTX polyglutamates slowly form, they accumulate in the cell as they are no longer substrates of ATP-driven efflux transporters (see below). Importantly, these accumulated MTX polyglutamates become irreversible inhibitors of both DHFR and TS. Hence, polyglutamylation of MTX and other antifolates is a key determinant of antifolate cytotoxicity (see below).

Over the recent decades, second and third generation antifolates were rationally synthesized (Fig. 3); these include more potent inhibitors of DHFR such as PT523 and some of its derivatives which inhibit DHFR with a 15-fold greater affinity than MTX (Ki=0.35 pM) [14]. Furthermore, DHFR inhibitors like edatrexate (10-ethyl-

10-deaza-aminopterin) and pralatrexate (10-propargyl-10-deazaaminopterin; PDX) have been rationally synthesized which display unique properties such as much better transport and increased polyglutamylation leading to augmented cellular accumulation and retention [24, 25]. Rationally-designed, novel generation antifolates also include potent TS inhibitors such as raltitrexed (Tomudex; ZD1694) [5] that have been approved for the treatment of advanced colorectal cancer [6] as well as pemetrexed (Alimta; MTA, LY231514) [7] that was registered in both the USA and Europe for the treatment of malignant pleural mesothelioma [8] and non-small cell lung cancer [9]. Additionally, other hydrophilic and lipophilic antifolates have been synthesized that are currently undergoing clinical evaluation as antitumor agents including the lipid-soluble antifolates nolatrexed (Thymitaq; AG337) [26], neutrexin (trimetrexate) [27] and piritrexim (BW301U [28], the polyglutamatable hydrophilic TS inhibitor OSI-7904(L) (GW1843U89) [29] as well as the non-polyglutamatable TS inhibitor plevitrexed (BGC9331; ZD9331) [30]. Antifolates including raltitrexed, pemetrexed, OSI-7904(L) and plevitrexed were rationally designed to be efficiently taken up by the reduced folate carrier (RFC), the primary transport system of both THF cofactors and antifolates (Fig. 3; see the next section). Whereas other antifolates, including the lipid-soluble antifolates nolatrexed, neutrexin and piritrexim were designed to enter cells by diffusion, thereby bypassing drug resistance phenomena associated with impaired drug uptake due to qualitative (i.e. inactivating mutations) and quantitative (i.e. down-regulation) alterations in the human RFC [31–33]. Other non-polyglutamable hydrophilic antifolates including plevitrexed and PT523 were designed to overcome antifolate-resistance phenomena associated with impaired antifolate polyglutamylation due to decreased activity of human folylpoly-γ-glutamate synthetase (FPGS) [34], the enzyme responsible for polyglutamyl conjugation of both THF cofactors and antifolates (see below). Recently, a novel hydrophilic antifolate BGC945 has been synthesized that is, on the one hand, a potent inhibitor of TS (Ki=1.2 nM) and on the other hand an excellent substrate of folate receptor α (FR α; Fig. 3), a high-affinity folate uptake route [35]. On the other hand, BGC945 is a very poor substrate for the RFC [35]. As such, this antifolate can selectively target human malignancies such as ovarian cancers that highly over-express FRα thereby avoiding cytotoxic side effects to most normal tissues that ubiquitously express the RFC but not FRα. Targeting GARTF as a determinant for novel antifolates was achieved in the 1980s with the introduction of the first selective and potent inhibitor (Ki=65 nM) lometrexol (5,10-dideaza-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolic acid (DDATHF) [36]. Recently, a more potent analogue of lometrexol, 10-(trifluoroacetyl)-5,10-dideazaacyclic-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolic acid was synthesized that displayed both potent inhibition of GARTF (Ki=15 nM) and cytotoxicity to human leukemia cells [37]. In summary, various THF-dependent enzymes have proven useful targets for the potent cytotoxic activity of antifolates some of which are currently used for the treatment of various human malignancies [10, 11].

1.3 Polyglutamylation as a mechanism of cellular retention of folates and antifolates

Folates are present in the blood at concentrations of ~10–50 nM [1]. The principal plasma folate 5-CH₃-THF is present at the monoglutamate form (Fig. 1). However, once taken up into cells via the RFC, 5-CH₃-THF, other THF

cofactors as well as antifolates (Figs. 3, 4) including MTX undergo polyglutamylation, a unique biochemical transformation catalyzed by FPGS. Hence, FPGS which resides in both the cytosol and mitochondria [38], catalyzes the MgATP-dependent sequential addition, one at a time, of multiple equivalents of glutamic acid to the γ-carboxyl group of THF cofactors and polyglutamatable antifolates (Fig. 4). The primary aim of this folylpoly-γ-glutamylation is to increase the cellular retention of THF cofactors [23, 39–41]. Polyglutamate conjugation of naturally occurring THF cofactors and antifolates achieves several important goals:

(a) Polyglutamates of THF coenzymes and antifolates are polyanions which are impermeable to lipid bilayers and are hence retained intracellularly.

(b) Most of the polyglutamyl congeners of THF cofactors are better substrates than their parent monoglutamate forms for various folate-dependent enzymes. This is a result of either an increased affinity (i.e. decreased Km) for THF-dependent enzymes, an increase in the catalytic activity of these enzymes (i.e. increased Vmax), or a combination of the two parameters [42]. For example, apart from the potent inhibition of DHFR by mono-, and polyglutamates of MTX, the latter, as well as polyglutamates of oxidized folates are also potent inhibitors of both TS, AICARTF, adenosine deaminase and 5′-adenylate deaminase [43–45]. Clearly, targeting multiple THF-dependent enzymes by these polyglutamyl congeners significantly augments the cytotoxic activity of MTX. Likewise, pentaglutamate derivatives of pemetrexed block the activities of both TS and GARTF with Ki values that are ~100-fold lower (i.e. more potent) than the parent monoglutamate form [7]. Likewise, tetraglutamate conjugates of raltitrexed are 65-fold more potent inhibitors of TS than the parent monoglutamate form [5].

(c) Relatively long chain (n>3) polyglutamate derivatives of THF coenzymes and antifolates are no longer substrates of membrane transport systems including folate influx transporters including RFC [46] and efflux transporters such as multidrug resistance proteins (MRPs) [11, 47, 48] and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) [49]. Consequently, polyglutamates of both THF cofactors and antifolates are efficiently retained within cells. A consequence of increased intracellular sequestration of antifolates is augmentation of their pharmacological activity through sustained inhibition of THF-dependent enzymes as discussed above. In fact, the level and time-course of formation of antifolate polyglutamates in tumor cells is a key determinant of the cytotoxic activity exerted by these folate antimetabolites. The clinical consequence and significance of

intracellular retention of antifolate polyglutamates is that polyglutamatable antifolates are administered to cancer patients with relatively long intervals between the repeated doses. In contrast, antifolates that cannot undergo polyglutamylation (i.e. both non-polyglutamatable water-soluble and lipid-soluble antifolates) require a frequent dosing schedule as they display a poorer retention and bioavailability [30, 50, 51].

Following THF cofactor transport from the cytosol into mitochondria by MFT [3], polyglutamylation is responsible for the retention of folylpolyglutamates in mitochondria, a process crucial for glycine biosynthesis [52]. This retention is mediated by the mitochondrial FPGS, a nuclear DNA-encoded enzyme.

### 1.4 Inward membrane transport of folates and antifolates

As mentioned above, naturally occurring THF cofactors and various hydrophilic antifolates possess a glutamic acid moiety and are consequently divalent anions at physiological pH (Fig. 1). As such, folates and antifolates which cannot traverse membranes must use specific transport systems for their cellular uptake. Currently, three independent transport systems are known to mediate the inward transport of folates and hydrophilic antifolates across the plasma membrane of mammalian cells:

(a) The primary pathway for the uptake of THF cofactors and hydrophilic antifolates is the RFC (SLC19A1) (reviewed in [46, 53]). RFC is a ubiquitously expressed ~85 kDa membrane glycoprotein with 12 predicted transmembrane segments as well as cytoplasmically located N-, C-termini, and a large central hinge region loop connecting the sixth and seventh transmembrane segments (Fig. 5(a)) [54, 55]. RFC is a classic member of the major facilitator superfamily of transporters (MFS) [56]. Within this very large superfamily is the solute carrier (SLC) family of facilitative carriers to which RFC and its homologues thiamine transporter 1 (THTR1) (SLC19A2) and THTR2 (SLC19A2) belong. Currently, the SLC family contains approximately 300 genes that have been classified in 43 sub-families ([http://www.gene.ucl.ac.uk/nomenclature/](http://www.gene.ucl.ac.uk/nomenclature/)). RFC is devoid of an ATP-binding site and consequently free energy from ATP hydrolysis is not utilized to energize (anti)folate substrate translocation. Instead, RFC as a facilitative carrier mediates the uphill transport of folates and hydrophilic antifolates by binding and exchanging organic phosphates such as adenine nucleotides that are known to accumulate to very high intracellular levels [57] as well as thiamine mono- and pyrophosphate [58, 59]. Consistently, murine L1210 leukemia cells stably overexpressing the mouse RFC

show a marked suppression in the net intracellular level of thiamine pyrophosphate as a result of an RFC-dependent efflux [58]. Conversely, the highest levels of thiamine pyrophosphate were found in cells harboring an RFC-inactivating mutation. Therefore, the RFC-mediated downhill efflux of these organic phosphates (e.g. adenine nucleotides as well as thiamine mono- and pyrophosphate) that are synthesized and retained in the cytoplasm is tightly coupled to the uphill transport of (anti)folates into the cells. In contrast to ATP-dependent transporters, RFC lacks a nucleotide binding domain (NBD) (i.e. ATP-binding site) and is therefore considered a low-capacity transporter. As such, the net efflux of organic phosphates via the RFC should be minimal when compared to the rate of the biosynthesis of these organic phosphates [60].

(b) A second route of folate uptake is the low pH folate transporter, the gene of which has been recently cloned

and termed proton-coupled folate transporter (PCFT; see Section 4.6). This transporter which is expressed independently of the RFC, functions optimally at acidic pH (5.5) and mediates the high affinity, unidirectional influx of both oxidized (e.g. folic acid) and reduced folates (e.g. 5-CH₃-THF) as well as several hydrophilic antifolates including MTX and pemetrexed (Fig. 3) [61–63]. This transporter has a high relevance for absorption of both folates and antifolates in the small intestine, the latter of which shows an optimal transport of folates at acidic pH (5.5) but only a residual activity at physiological pH (7.4).

(c) A third transport route involves folate receptors (FRs). FRs designate a family of high-affinity folate-binding membrane glycoproteins encoded by three distinct genes known as FRα, FRβ and FRγ (reviewed in [64, 65]). The mature FRs are homologous proteins with ~70–80% amino acid identity and contain 229–236
amino acids as well as two to three N-glycosylation sites. FRα and FRβ are glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored cell surface glycoproteins, whereas FRγ is devoid of a GPI anchor and is a secreted protein [66]. FRα and FRβ display a high affinity for folic acid (Kd=0.1–1 nM), lometrexol (5,10-dideazatetrahydrofolate; DDATHF; Ki=0.4–1.3 nM using \[^{3}\)H] folic acid as a substrate) and BGC945 (Kd=1 nM) but much lower affinity for MTX (Kd>100 nM) [67]. The FR-dependent uptake of folates and antifolates proceeds via a classical mechanism of receptor-mediated endocytosis. In contrast to the RFC that is relatively ubiquitously expressed in various tissues, FRα expression is restricted to the luminal surface of certain epithelial cells [64, 65]. Likewise, FRβ also has a restricted pattern of expression in placenta, thymus, spleen and various cells in the myelomonocytic lineage including ALL [68, 69]. It should be noted that the cycling rate of the dominant route for THF cofactor uptake via the RFC is 100-fold faster than that of FRα and FRβ. Hence, in tissues with low RFC expression, significant levels of FRs may be critical for the uptake of folates.

### 1.5 Antifolate efflux via ATP-driven multidrug resistance (MDR) efflux transporters

ATP-Binding Cassette (ABC) transporters constitute the largest and widely expressed superfamily of membrane transport proteins currently comprising 49 members in humans (reviewed in [70, 71]). ABC transporters couple the energy of ATP hydrolysis to the translocation of various cytotoxic drugs and endogenous substrates across biological membranes. In addition to their role in extrusion of cytotoxic compounds, some members of the ABCC family of multidrug resistance proteins (MRPs) also mediate the ATP-dependent efflux of folic acid, THF coenzymes and hydrophilic antifolates (for a recent review see [11]); furthermore, breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP/ABCG2) which belongs to the small ABCG family, also mediates the ATP-driven efflux of (anti)folates (Fig. 4). Members of the ABCC family share conserved structural characteristics in their NBDs that distinguish them from other ABC proteins. Members of the MRP family can be further classified into two sub-groups “long” (MRP1, -2, -3, -6, and -7) and “short” MRPs (MRP4, -5, -8, -9, and -10). The short MRPs have a typical ABC transporter structure with two hydrophobic polytopic membrane spanning domains (MSD₁ and MSD₂) and two hydrophilic NBDs that are localized in the cytoplasm; whereas, the long MRPs have an additional NH₂-terminal MSD (i.e. MSD₀). The long MRPs typically contain 17 hydrophobic transmembrane segments, whereas the short MRPs contain only 12 transmembrane segments. The MSDs of various multidrug resistance (MDR) transporters have been identified as the substrate-binding sites particularly in studies using affinity probes as well as site-directed mutagenesis of certain MSDs [72, 73]. MRP1, the first member of the MRP family to be discovered is a ~190 kDa N-glycosylated transmembrane protein [74]. Members of the MRP family confer MDR to various hydrophobic or hydrophilic cytotoxic agents by functioning as low affinity, high capacity ATP-dependent drug efflux pumps. Among the various drug substrates of MRPs are natural product drugs and their conjugated metabolites [75, 76].

The phenomenon of folate and antifolate efflux in cultured malignant cells has long been known [77–79]. Pioneering detailed studies by Henderson and Zevely [80] more than two decades ago have shown that mammalian cells including murine L1210 and human CCRF-CEM leukemia cells as well as erythrocytes contain several ATP-driven multispecific organic anion transporters (MOAT) and/or glutathione (GSH)-conjugate (i.e. GS-X) pumps [81–83]. In these detailed kinetic studies it was found that these energy-dependent efflux transporters are able to transport (i.e. efflux) various organic compounds including MTX. This initial dissection, which discerned between the multiple MTX efflux pathways has been achieved using various transport inhibitors [81, 84]. Shortly thereafter, by comparing wild-type Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats and mutant Eisai hyperbilirubinemic rats (EHBRs), whose canalicular multispecific organic anion transporter 2 (cMOAT/MRP2/ABCC2) is absent from the canalicular membrane as a consequence of heredity, it was found that MTX is transported into the bile [85]. Using canalicular membrane vesicles (CMV) from wild type SD rats an ATP-dependent transport of L-MTX with a Km of ~0.3 mM was identified. Moreover, L-MTX competitively inhibited the ATP-driven transport of a classical substrate of cMOAT, \[^{3}\)H]2,4-dinitrophenyl-S-glutathione (DNP-SG), with an L-MTX inhibition constant that was comparable with its own Km. Consistently, increased uptake of MTX was directly demonstrated in membrane vesicles isolated from GLC4/ADR cells, which overexpress MRP1 (ABCC1) [86]. Subsequent key studies by Hooijberg et al., [87] and Kool et al., [88] have clearly established that MRP1, MRP2 (ABCC2) and MRP3 (ABCC3) are MTX transporters and upon overexpression they confer a high level of resistance to various hydrophilic antifolates [11].

Despite all these *in vitro* studies, the first direct *in vivo* evidence that certain members of the MRP family may be able to transport the hydrophilic antifolate MTX was provided by Masuda and colleagues [85] who demonstrated that MTX is transported into the bile in wild type SD rats but not in rats hereditarily deficient in MRP2 function (i.e. EHBR). Furthermore, using CMV isolated from wild type SD rats these researchers found an ATP-dependent transportof L-MTX with a Km of ~0.3 mM. Moreover, L-MTX competitively inhibited the ATP-driven transport of radio-labeled 2,4-DNP-SG, a classical substrate of MRP2, with an L-MTX inhibition constant that was comparable with its own Km. Independently, increased uptake of MTX was directly demonstrated in membrane vesicles isolated from GLC4/ADR cells which overexpress MRP1 [86]. Based on these early studies suggesting that MRP1 and MRP2 have the ability to bind and translocate MTX, subsequent detailed kinetic studies with isolated membrane vesicles from transfected cells overexpressing MRP1 through MRP5 have definitively shown that all these MRPs transport MTX in an ATP-dependent manner with a typical Km in the millimolar range (recently reviewed in [11]). Certain amino acids residing in transmembrane helices of MRP1 and MRP2 have been implicated in the binding and/or translocation of MTX; specifically, substitution of a highly conserved tryptophan residue at position 1254 in the last transmembrane segment (TM17) of MRP2 resulted in the complete loss of MTX transport as well as in the disruption of the transport of leukotriene C4 and estradiol glucuronide [89]. Similar results were obtained with MRP1 after substitution of Trp1254 [90].

Although MRPs are low affinity MTX transporters they proved to be high-capacity efflux transporters with an average Vmax value in the range of ~1 μmol/min/mg protein. Hence, whereas the low affinity of the various MRPs for MTX may argue against a clinical relevance in chemotherapeutic regimens containing antifolates, one should bear in mind that during the chemotherapeutic treatment of certain human malignancies including osteosarcoma and ALL, as high as 1 mM plasma concentrations are achieved [91]. Given the high capacity of these MTX efflux transporters when compared to the 100-fold lower capacity of the RFC [92], these MRPs should have a significant effect on MTX bioavailability and disposition. In support of this suggestion are the following observations: (a) as mentioned above, *in vivo* experiments with EHBR, rats lacking MRP2 function demonstrated a poor MTX transport into the bile [85]. (b) *In vivo* results with the latter EHBR, also revealed an extremely poor excretion into the bile of various naturally occurring THF cofactors [93]. As these and the above results establish that the various MRPs bind and export the folic acid antagonist MTX, the role of MRPs in mediating resistance to this cytotoxic drug as well as to other antifolates was explored in various studies which was recently reviewed [11].

### 2 Molecular mechanisms of antifolate resistance

Since the introduction of MTX nearly 60 years ago [4], various second and third generation antifolates were introduced (recently reviewed in [10, 11]). However, inherent and acquired drug resistance phenomena continue to pose major obstacles towards curative antifolate-based chemotherapy of various human cancers. The well documented multiple mechanisms of antifolate resistance in tumor cells *in vitro* and *in vivo* include:

- **2.1 Impaired antifolate uptake due to loss of RFC function.**
- **2.2 Increased antifolate efflux due to overexpression of ATP-driven MDR efflux transporters.**
- **2.3 Overexpression of DHFR and mutations that decrease its affinity for antifolates.**
- **2.4 Overexpression of TS and mutations which decrease its affinity for antifolates.**
- **2.5 Defective antifolate polyglutamylation due to decreased FPGS expression and/or inactivating mutations.**
- **2.6 Increased expression of γ-glutamyl hydrolase (GGH).**
- **2.7 Expansion of intracellular THF cofactor pools.**

These different modalities of antifolate resistance are discussed below in detail.

#### 2.1 Impaired antifolate uptake due to loss of RFC function

Although various molecular mechanisms of loss of RFC function have been revealed in the past decade, impaired antifolate transport in tumor cell lines cultured *in vitro* as well as in murine leukemia models *in vivo*, has been long recognized since the introduction of MTX [94–98]. Defective antifolate influx has been widely associated with decreased human RFC gene expression and down-regulation of the transporter protein in various preclinical studies with different antifolate-resistant cell lines [33, 99–110]. Moreover, in the past decade, these key *in vitro* findings have been extended to clinical studies exploring RFC levels and function in cancer patients; this paved the way for translating basic preclinical studies with tumor cell lines to the clinical studies aimed at possible improvement of rationally-based antifolate-containing chemotherapy. In this respect, decreased RFC expression was detected in ALL, osteosarcoma, colorectal cancer as well as primary central nervous system lymphoma at the transcript and/or protein levels [108, 111–118]. Impaired transport of antifolates into tumor cells in preclinical and clinical studies has been associated with quantitative and/or qualitative alterations in RFC expression and/or transport activity:

(a) **RFC mutations which alter its transport function by modulating either its affinity for folates and antifolates (increased Km) or by disrupting its substrate translocation activity (decreased Vmax).** Shortly after the molecular cloning of the human [99, 119, 120], murine [121] and hamster RFCs [122], the first inactivatingmutation in the mouse RFC was identified in MTX-resistant L1210 murine leukemia cells [123]. The presence of a helix-breaking proline in place of an alanine in transmembrane segment 5 resulted in a major fall in the MTX transport Vmax due to the loss of carrier mobility. In fact, loss of RFC transport activity due to inactivating mutations was found to be a frequent mechanism of resistance to hydrophilic antifolates that use this transporter as the primary port of entry into mouse and human tumor cells (Fig. 5(a–c)) [31–33, 110, 124–126]. The multiple human RFC mutations appeared to form a mutation cluster region thereby suggesting a functional role for the first transmembrane segment in (anti)folate substrate binding and/or carrier mobility [33] (Fig. 5(a–c)). A major mutation identified in both the murine and human RFC following antifolate selection involved a Glu to Lys substitution at amino acid 45 (Glu45Lys or E45K) residing in the first transmembrane helix [31, 32, 127] (Fig. 5(a), (b)). This mutation in both MTX- and GW1843U89-resistant human leukemia cells resulted in a 9–31-fold decrease in the folic acid and leucovorin transport Km values (i.e. markedly increased affinity), with decreased transport Vmax. Hence, although loss of RFC transport activity may seem a priori incompatible with cell survival due to the loss of THF cofactor uptake, this Glu45Lys mutation demonstrates that loss of antifolate influx can be accompanied by a significant preservation of folate cofactor uptake. Consistently, an adjacent Ser46Asn substitution in MTX-resistant mouse leukemia cells grown on leucovorin as the sole folate source, resulted in a dramatic fall in the MTX transport Vmax with a much lesser decrease in the transport Vmax for the naturally occurring folates leucovorin and 5-CH₃-THF [128]. Thus, the marked loss of carrier affinity and/or mobility towards antifolates, while relatively preserving THF cofactor transport, facilitated the accumulation of sufficient intracellular folate pools to sustain cell growth and DNA replication. It should be noted that various nonsense as well as missense mutations in both the murine and human RFCs completely disrupted their folate and antifolate transport function, thereby raising the inevitable question of how such mutant cells can attain sufficient intracellular folate pools to support growth and DNA synthesis. A recently emerging answer shows that cultured human tumor cells which have completely lost RFC expression and function due to a complete genomic deletion of the RFC locus can retain a significant influx of both MTX and THF cofactors via the alternative route of the low pH folate transporter which operates optimally at acidic pH ([129]; see Section 4.6). Moreover, under

lipophilic antifolate selective pressure, cultured mammalian cells may acquire a significant increase in the transport activity of this low pH folate transporter thereby achieving sufficient intracellular folates to support cellular growth and DNA synthesis [63]. As the interstitial pH in solid tumors is generally acidic, the mechanism by which THF cofactors and antifolates are transported at low pH could conceivably be an important determinant of antifolate cytotoxicity.

The clinical occurrence of RFC sequence alterations in ALL and osteosarcoma patients undergoing MTX-based chemotherapy was also addressed in various studies [130–132]. Two large studies with 105 [130] and 250 ALL specimens [132] failed to show any frequent RFC sequence alterations. However, in another large clinical study with 162 osteosarcoma patients, heterozygous RFC mutations were found to be relatively frequent [133]. Using a previously established single-stranded conformational polymorphism assay of RFC exon 2 [31, 32] followed by DNA sequencing revealed that 9.2% of the specimens harbored mutations. Of interest was the finding that some of the well-characterized mutations identified in antifolate-resistant cell lines *in vitro* including Ser46Asn were also identified in osteosarcoma patients. In a follow-up study, the functionality of these mutant RFC proteins was assessed by fusing green fluorescent protein (GFP) to the C-terminus of these altered RFCs and examining the ability of the transfected constructs to functionally complement a hamster cell line null for the RFC [134]. Interestingly, a Leu291Pro mutation resulted in the lack of plasma membrane targeting, thereby conferring resistance to MTX. In contrast, three mutations, Ser4Pro, Ser46Asn and Gly259Trp complemented the RFC null cell line and conferred only a modest level of MTX resistance. Whereas, several other mutations complemented the RFC null cell line but failed to confer any MTX resistance. Hence, collectively, definitive RFC mutations are relatively frequent in osteosarcoma, however, only a small fraction of these mutations confers MTX resistance. Whereas, the remaining mutations did not appear to confer any drug selective advantage and may be regarded as the result of the genomic instability that is characteristic of various cancers including osteosarcomas.

(b) Transcriptional silencing of the human RFC gene due to loss of function of transcription factors that regulate its expression under physiological conditions. Recently, evidence has accumulated to suggest that various key transcription factors including the Sp1 family, cyclic AMP-response element binding protein (CREB), USF-1, AP-2, Ikaros, GATA and p53 are involved in the complex regulation of human RFC gene expression in various tissues under physiological conditions [135–140]. While several promoters appear to be operative along with some repressor sequences,the basal inducible elements (e.g. dependent on CREB/ ATF binding) as well as the constitutive elements (e.g. driven by Sp1 family of transcription factors) of the human RFC promoter(s), have been defined. This initial analysis paved the way for the assessment of the possible role that alterations in the function of transcription factors may play in the transcriptional silencing of the human RFC gene in antifolate-resistant cells with impaired drug influx. Indeed, antifolate- resistant cells with a severe to a complete loss of RFC gene expression displayed multiple co-existent alte- rations in both the function of constitutively active transcription factors including Sp1 as well as inducible nuclear factors such as CREB [105–107, 109, 110]. Of particular interest was the novel finding that subtle alterations in post-translational modifications of tran- scription factors including altered phosphorylation patterns abolished Sp1 and CREB function thereby resulting in loss of RFC gene expression. In the first study, it was found that loss of function of CREB, a key transactivator of human RFC gene expression, was due to disruption of the auto-regulatory loop of CREB resulting from lack of CREB phosphorylation [107]; since phosphorylation of Ser133 of CREB, a post-translational modification crucial for its transcrip- tional transactivation activity was lost in these antifolate-resistant cells, RFC gene expression was consequently markedly decreased without affecting the expression of various housekeeping genes [107]. Remarkably, treatment with cAMP reactive agents such as forskolin and dibutyryl cAMP resulted in restoration of CREB phosphorylation, reactivation of its transcriptional activity and consequent induction of RFC gene expression. Consistently, in another study [109], an apparent discrepancy was noted in that GC- box dependent transcription was highly impaired in antifolate-resistant cells with impaired RFC function, whereas normal protein levels of members of the Sp1 family of transcription factors were surprisingly retained. This led to the hypothesis that alterations in post-translational modifications including phos- phorylation may underlie the loss of Sp1 function. Indeed, affinity chromatography purification of nu- clear phosphoproteins followed by high resolution 2- dimensional gel electrophoresis revealed an inhibitory hyperphosphorylation of Sp1 thereby resulting in the loss of function of Sp1 in antifolate-resistant cells. Importantly, the transcriptional activation of RFC gene expression could be restored, at least in part, by cGMP-reactive agents that activate protein phos- phatase 2A, the latter of which eliminated the inhibitory Sp1 phosphorylation [109]. Taken collec- tively, these results establish that alterations in the

function of transcription factors that physiologically regulate human RFC gene expression may underlie antifolate-resistance phenomena associated with im- paired drug influx. Current studies are underway to determine whether such alterations in transcription factors are present in tumor specimens obtained prior to and after antifolate-based chemotherapy.

(c) Transcriptional silencing of the human RFC gene via CpG island promoter methylation. RFC gene silencing via promoter methylation was first observed in human MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells with inherent resistance to MTX [103]. These cells are severely deficient in MTX transport due to the complete lack of RFC transcripts. A methylated CpG island in the promoter region of the RFC was found in MDA-MB- 231 cells but not in RFC expressing, MTX sensitive, MCF-7 human breast cancer cells. Chromatin immu- noprecipitation with antibodies against acetylated histones H3 and H4 revealed that the RFC promoter was enriched for acetylated histones only on unmethy- lated RFC expressed alleles of parental MCF-7 cells. Consistently, treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells with the DNA methylation inhibitor 2-deoxy-azacytidine restored RFC expression but failed to reverse MTX resistance, potentially due to the up-regulation of MDR efflux transporters. In contrast to this single report of RFC promoter methylation, various studies with multiple human tumor cell lines displaying resistance to different antifolates failed to detect transcriptional silencing via CpG island methylation of the human RFC promoter [102, 106, 141]. Hence, while this mechanism does not appear to be a major modality of RFC gene silencing, recent clinical studies have detected an aberrant methylation in the promoter region of the RFC gene in primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) patients undergoing high- dose (HD) MTX-based chemotherapy [118]. Of the total 40 PCNSL specimens studied, 30% showed RFC promoter methylation. Similarly, 24% of the HD-MTX treated PCNSL patients displayed RFC promoter methylation. Furthermore, the overall survival rate of PCNSL patients with RFC promoter methylation was very poor when compared to that of their unmethy- lated counterparts. Hence, further clinical studies are warranted to assess the prognostic role of RFC promoter methylation in HD-MTX treated PCNSL patients and other malignancies that are also treated with HD-MTX including osteosarcomas and ALL.

(d) Alterations in RFC gene copy number and trans- locations in antifolate-resistant cells. The assignment of the RFC locus to the telomeric region of chromo- some 21 (21q22.2–q22.3) [99, 142], combined with the genomic instability that characterizes varioushuman cancers may result in a variety of chromosomal aberrations that alter RFC copy number and/or gene expression status. It has been shown that decreased RFC gene copy number due to allele(s) loss or deletion of the entire RFC locus may occur following selection with different antifolates [110, 129, 141]. Loss of RFC allele(s) may arise either as a sole mechanism of resistance or in combination with multiple modalities of antifolate resistance including mutational inactivation and transcriptional silencing of the RFC gene via loss of function of transcription factors. Furthermore, RFC translocations such as the fusion of chromosomes 21 and 22 may also disrupt gene expression [141]. Furthermore, changes in the ploidy of pre-B and B-lineage lymphoblasts in ALL were also identified; in this case, RFC expression was much higher in hyperdiploid than in non-hyperdiploid ALL lymphoblasts [112, 114, 143]. Of interest was the finding that stepwise deprivation of THF cofactors from the culture medium (e.g. leucovorin) of human leukemia and erythroleukemia cells resulted in a marked RFC gene amplification and translocation to other chromosomes (e.g. chromosomes 2 and 15) [144, 145]. In this case, the homogenously staining region (HSR) of the RFC amplicon resulted in a marked and stable RFC overexpression which ensured the provision of sufficient reduced folate cofactors to sustain cell growth and DNA replication even under subnanomolar concentrations of leucovorin in the culture medium.

### 2.2 Increased antifolate efflux due to overexpression of ATP-driven MDR efflux transporters

The roles of MDR transporters including MRP1 through MRP5 and BCRP in the ATP-driven efflux of THF cofactors and hydrophilic antifolates in the mono-, di- and triglutamate conjugate forms have been recently reviewed [11]. Moreover, the latter review also delineates the impact that alterations in the expression of MRPs and BCRP may have on the intracellular folate pool size as well as on folate homeostasis under folate replete (i.e. physiological) and deplete conditions. Briefly, MRP1 through MRP5 and BCRP have the facility to transport folates and antifolates including MTX, raltitrexed and pemetrexed. This transport ability is in addition to their established facility to accommodate and extrude multiple cytotoxic agents thereby resulting in the MDR phenotype. Of particular interest was the finding that certain MDR efflux transporters including MRP5 and BCRP can transport mono-, di-, and tri-glutamate conjugates of folates and antifolates (Fig. 4). Hence, consistent with this antifolate efflux capability and the substantially decreased cellular accumulation of antifolates, overexpression of some of these ATP-driven drug exporters including MRP1, MRP3, MRP5 and BCRP conferred moderate to very high levels of resistance to various antifolates upon a 4-h drug exposure. However, it should be emphasized that no overexpression of any of the MRPs or BCRP has been reported to date in antifolate-selected cell lines. Hence, currently, no hydrophilic antifolate has been shown to provoke MRP or BCRP overexpression as a mechanism of drug resistance.

### 2.3 Overexpression of DHFR and mutations that decrease its affinity for antifolates

Original studies performed three decades ago discovered that a frequent mechanism of acquired MTX resistance is DHFR gene amplification and consequent enzyme overexpression [146]. Hence, upon selection of cultured tumor cell lines in progressively increasing concentrations of MTX, acquired antifolate-resistance is frequently due to DHFR gene amplification. The DHFR amplicon exists either as a stable expanded chromosome region known as HSR [147–149], or as an unstable form involving small paired nucleosomal chromatin, denoted double minute (DMs) chromosomes [150, 151]. DMs are acentromeric and cannot participate in equal chromosome segregation at mitosis and are therefore frequently lost in daughter cells. DHFR gene amplification has been clinically observed in various cancers after treatment with MTX [152, 153]. Since the discovery of DHFR gene amplification, a spectrum of amplifications of various genes has been shown to occur in different human cancers prior to and after chemotherapy and is therefore considered one of the hallmarks of genomic instability in neoplasms [154].

Both stable and unstable DHFR gene amplifications result in enzyme overexpression which brings about a consistent level of resistance to MTX and other DHFR inhibitors. The mechanistic biochemical basis underlying this phenomenon is that the fraction of DHFR required to provide sufficient cellular THF pools necessary to sustain DNA replication becomes smaller and smaller the higher the overexpression of DHFR. For example, if 5% of the catalytically active DHFR is required to meet the cellular demands for THF cofactors [19, 22, 53], upon 100-fold DHFR gene amplification only 0.05% of cytosolic DHFR are sufficient to meet the cellular need for THF cofactors. Clearly, since MTX transport primarily occurring via the RFC is a non-concentrative process, achieving a greater than 99.95% inhibition of DHFR with antifolates including MTX is very difficult as this could require the attaining of highly toxic or even lethal MTX blood concentrations.

Previous studies have demonstrated that human DHFR, in addition to its critical role in providing one-carbon donor units crucial for nucleotide biosynthesis and DNA replication, functions as an RNA-binding protein [155, 156].
Specifically, DHFR protein forms a ribonucleoprotein complex with its own cognate RNA, and this RNA-protein interaction results in translational repression. A model of DHFR translational autoregulation has been proposed, and this regulatory mechanism is believed to have particular biological importance as it offers a tightly regulated process for the provision of precise levels of a key enzyme crucial for DNA synthesis. Of special interest was the finding that antifolate inhibitors of DHFR including MTX tightly bound DHFR, produced a conformational change in the enzyme thereby leading to prevention of binding to its own mRNA and consequent resumption of DHFR mRNA translation [157]. In fact, this is the mechanism that is believed to relieve the translational autoregulation thereby leading to induced DHFR expression and the development of cellular resistance to antifolate inhibitors of DHFR. Moreover, a recent study has identified amino acid residues in human DHFR that are essential for upregulation of the DHFR protein in response to antifolate treatment [158]. It was proposed that DHFR mutants that are not up-regulated by MTX are unable to bind their cognate mRNA. Collectively, these findings show that upon treatment with antifolate inhibitors of DHFR, a significant induction in DHFR levels is observed that is initially attributable to the relieve of the autoregulatory translational repression by the binding of the antifolate to DHFR, thereby resulting in a free DHFR mRNA that is available for translation. It remains to be determined to what extent such translational autoregulatory loops contribute to antifolate resistance phenomena in human cancers.

Studies performed prior to, and during the discovery of DHFR gene amplification demonstrated that one determinant of MTX resistance in tumor cell lines, albeit with lower frequency than DHFR gene amplification, is decreased affinity of DHFR for MTX [159–162]. This was shown to result from DHFR mutations that markedly decrease the affinity of the enzyme for 4-amino antifolates but in the same time produce a smaller decrease in the affinity of the enzyme for the natural substrate DHF. This allowed for the retention of sufficient DHFR activity to yield sufficient THF cofactors for DNA replication, provided the altered enzyme underwent overexpression due to gene amplification. Indeed, in an original study, Haber et al., [163] used 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis to identify a structurally altered DHFR with a marked change in the protein pI that was later confirmed to be a result of a Leu22Arg mutation [164]. This structurally altered enzyme displayed a 270-fold decrease in the binding affinity for MTX but only a 3-fold increase in the Km for DHF, while retaining an intact binding of the cofactor NADPH. Hence, cells overexpressing this altered enzyme retained sufficient affinity for DHF as well as catalytic activity as reflected in the Kcat value. Multiple subsequent studies with several MTX-resistant cell lines confirmed the occurrence of DHFR mutations including Gly15Trp, Leu22Arg or Phe as well as Phe31Trp or Ser [165–169]. It is noteworthy that the mutant DHFR allele in MTX-resistant cell lines sometimes underwent allele-specific gene amplification and overexpression presumably as a selective or adaptive response to ensure sufficient catalytic activity of DHF reduction [163, 167, 168, 170]. It should be emphasized however, that although DHFR mutations were detected in preclinical studies with MTX-resistant tumor cell lines, no such mutations were yet identified in clinical specimens from pediatric ALL patients that underwent multiple courses of HD-MTX chemotherapy [171]. The possible explanation for this lies in the need for considerable DHFR gene amplification to offset the lowered catalytic efficiency along with the need for two-base mutations for most substitutions, both of which are presumably infrequent events.

2.4 Overexpression of TS and mutations which decrease its affinity for antifolates

A decade after the introduction of 4-amino antifolates to the oncology clinic, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) was synthesized and introduced as the second class of fluorinated pyrimidine anticancer antimetabolites [172]. In the presence of the TS coenzyme, 5,10-CH₂-THF, 5-FU disrupts DNA replication via conversion of dUMP to 5-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine 5′-monophosphate (5-F-dUMP), thereby leading to irreversible inhibition of TS due to the formation of a ternary complex. Subsequent studies have generated rationally-designed THF-based antagonists that potently inhibit TS including raltitrexed [5], pemetrexed [7], plevitrexed [30] and thymitaq [26], the first two of which have been approved for the treatment of colorectal cancer, malignant pleural mesothelioma and lung cancer [6, 8, 9–11]. The molecular basis of resistance to this class of TS-targeted novel antifolates has been associated with enzyme overexpression as well as with mutations that decrease the affinity of the enzyme for these drugs. Consistent with DHFR gene amplification in MTX-resistant cells was TS gene amplification and overexpression in various human cell lines selected for stepwise resistance to TS inhibitors including 5-FU, ICI-198583 (C2-desamino-C2-methyl-N10-propargyl-5,8-dideazafolic acid), raltitrexed [5, 173–178] and pemetrexed [179, 180]. This was associated with variable levels of cross-resistance to other folate-based TS inhibitors. Hence, one should bear in mind the fact that differences in the levels of cross-resistance to these antifolates may be due to various important biochemical factors including antifolate transport, extent of antifolate polyglutamylation, cellular retention as well as THF cofactor pool size [11].
As with the autoregulation of DHFR, recent investigations have demonstrated that the level of TS is also tightly controlled via an autoregulatory negative feedback mechanism wherein TS protein specifically interacts with its own mRNA and negatively controls translational efficiency [181]. This mechanism provides for the rapid modulation of the level of TS required to sustain dTTP levels crucial for DNA synthesis and is apparently an important determinant by which malignant cells may become rapidly insensitive to 5-FU and other folate-based TS inhibitors. Of interest was the finding that the inclusion of dUMP, 5-F-dUMP or 5,10-CH₂-THF in the *in vitro* translation assay, completely relieved the inhibition of TS mRNA translation by TS protein. According to this intriguing paradigm, TS inhibitors which tightly bind to TS, interfere with the formation of the binary complex of TS protein and TS mRNA thereby rendering the latter available for translation [182, 183]. In contrast, other studies provided evidence that inhibitor- and ligand-mediated induction of TS enzyme is due to TS stabilization rather than translational de-repression [178].

In the clinic, 5-FU resistance in colorectal cancer patients has been attributed to TS gene amplification as determined by digital karyotyping [184]. Specifically, analysis of TS by fluorescence in situ hybridization identified TS gene amplification in 23% of 5-FU-treated advanced colorectal cancers, whereas no gene amplification was observed in metastases from patients that had not been treated with 5-FU. Moreover, patients with metastases containing TS gene amplification had a substantially shorter median survival rate than those lacking gene amplification. Hence, in this study, it was concluded that genomic TS amplification is a major mechanism of 5-FU resistance *in vivo*.

Structural alterations due to mutations in TS also constitute an established determinant of antifolate-resistance. Remarkably, some of these TS mutations produced drug-resistance profiles that were selective for certain TS inhibitors while retaining sensitivity to other classes of TS inhibitors. For example, human sarcoma HT1080 cells exposed to thymitaq (Fig. 3), a lipophilic antifolate TS inhibitor, in the presence of the mutagen ethyl methanesulfonate resulted in drug-resistance phenotypes that were due to TS mutations and/or gene amplification [185]. Thus, the observed Asp49Gly and Gly52Ser mutations in TS conferred resistance to the selecting agent thymitaq and cross-resistance to 5-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine but not to raltitrexed and GW1843U89, thereby confirming the different TS binding sites for these antifolates. Furthermore, consistent with DHFR mutations, the acquired TS mutations may also compromise the catalytic activity of the enzyme thereby selecting for the advantageous event of mutant allele-specific TS gene amplification. Interestingly, a human colorectal cell line that is inherently resistant to 5-fluoro-

2′-deoxyuridine has been identified that expressed TS with a reduced affinity for 5-FdUMP and 5,10-CH₂-THF, relative to the drug-sensitive enzyme [186]. A follow-up study identified a Tyr33His mutation in a highly conserved TS region that is critical for both 5-FdUMP and 5,10-CH₂-THF cosubstrate binding [187].

### 2.5 Defective antifolate polyglutamylation due to decreased FPGS expression and/or inactivating mutations

Given the key role polyglutamylation plays in cellular retention of antifolates and cytotoxicity, it is not surprising that impaired FPGS activity is a major determinant of resistance to polyglutamylation-dependent antifolates. It should be noted however, that impaired antifolate uptake due to RFC alterations, may also present as defective polyglutamylation, while retaining intact FPGS activity; this could lead to misleading conclusions of defective antifolate polyglutamylation. For example, MTX-resistant ZR-75 human breast cancer cells displayed a markedly defective formation of MTX polyglutamylates while retaining normal FPGS catalytic activity and affinity for MTX [188]. The underlying basis of the antifolate-resistance in these cells was initially believed to be defective antifolate polyglutamylation. However, in later studies, it was found that these MTX-resistant cells were highly defective in MTX transport due to the complete lack of RFC transcripts [100]; both transport of, and sensitivity to MTX were restored by stable transfection of the human RFC cDNA [189]. However, a genuine decrease in antifolate polyglutamylation has been reported in various MTX-resistant tumor cells [34, 126, 190–193]. Decreased FPGS activity was observed in various malignant cell lines selected for resistance to different polyglutamatable antifolates [176, 192, 194, 195]. Moreover, in a systematic study using various polyglutamatable inhibitors of DHFR, TS and GARTF, fourteen antifolate-resistant human leukemia cell lines were isolated following a repeated high-dose intermittent schedule that best mimics the chemotherapeutic treatment [34]. The vast majority of antifolate-resistant cell lines displayed a 90–99% loss of FPGS activity, frequently in the absence of any substantial decrease in FPGS mRNA levels. These cell lines displayed up to 5 orders of magnitude of cross-resistance to polyglutamylation-dependent antifolates including raltitrexed and pemetrexed, while retaining sensitivity to polyglutamylation-independent antifolates such as PT523 and plevitrexed. Moreover, owing to the major contraction in the cellular folate pools, these drug-resistant cells exhibited a marked hypersensitivity to the lipid-soluble antifolates neutrexin (trimetrexate) and AG377. Consistent with these results was the finding that multiple tumor cell lines with resistance to various polyglutamatable antifolates showed a marked suppression of
FPGS activity frequently in the absence of decreased FPGS mRNA levels [176, 194, 196, 197]. These results suggest the existence of post-transcriptional alterations such as decreased translation thereby resulting in decreased FPGS protein levels [198].

Although infrequent, acquired FPGS mutations associated with decreased FPGS activity and/or decreased antifolate binding have been documented in antifolate-resistant cell lines. Hence, inactivating mutations occurring in one or two FPGS alleles were identified in both human and murine FPGS in MTX-resistant and lometrexol-resistant leukemia cell lines [34, 199]. In the one study [199], mouse L1210 leukemia cells were exposed to lometrexol in the presence of the mutagen ethylmethane sulfonate and lometrexol-resistant, MTX-sensitive clones were isolated and characterized. FPGS activity was decreased by more than 98% in the absence of a reduction in FPGS mRNA levels. Instead, several mutations which affect both FPGS alleles were present that mapped to several conserved FPGS domains involved either in the binding of the substrates (i.e. ATP, folate and glutamate) or catalytic activity. It is noteworthy that both FPGS alleles were affected by independent inactivating mutations. These clonal variants displayed a marked cross-resistance to polyglutamatable antifolates including raltitrexed and pemetrexed but were sensitive to the polyglutamylation-independent antifolate plevitrexed. Transfection of these mutant FPGS cDNAs into FPGS null cells restored cell growth and recapitulated the antifolate-resistance phenotype. Consistent with the loss of FPGS function and the decreased intracellular folate pool was the 6–14-fold increase in the folate growth requirement of these mutants. In the this study [34], of the eleven human leukemia cell lines with marked loss of FPGS activity following selection with multiple antifolates, only a single cell line harbored a heterozygous Cys346Phe mutation. This mutant FPGS displayed a 23-fold decreased affinity to L-glutamate presumably due to a bulky clash between the mutant Phe346 and a native Phe350 within α helix A10 in a highly conserved C-terminal hydrophobic core. The role of this FPGS domain in the binding of the various substrates and in enzyme activity were confirmed by both site-directed mutagenesis of the human recombinant FPGS [200] as well as based on the crystal structure of *L. casei* FPGS and homologies with various folate-dependent enzymes [201]. Remarkably, this Cys346Phe mutant cell line with loss of FPGS activity displayed as high as 100,000-fold resistance to the polyglutamylation-dependent antifolate raltitrexed but in the same time retained wild type sensitivity to antifolates that do not require polyglutamylation for their pharmacological activity including plevitrexed, PT523 and MTX. In summary, loss of FPGS activity is a predominant mechanism of resistance to polyglutamylation-dependent

antifolates, particularly upon clinically relevant, repeated and intermittent short pulse exposures. However, although inactivating FPGS mutations do exist, they do not appear to be a frequent mechanism underlying loss of FPGS function. These findings warrant further studies to characterize the post-transcriptional mechanisms involved in the loss of FPGS activity in antifolate-resistant tumor cells in the absence of decreased FPGS mRNA levels.

### 2.6 Increased expression of γ-glutamyl hydrolase (GGH)

The enzyme counteracting (anti)folate polyglutamylation is γ-glutamyl hydrolase (GGH) (Fig. 4). Hence, GGH is a lysosomal glycoprotein that acts as a cysteine ecto- and/or endo-peptidase to hydrolyze the γ-polyglutamate chains attached to THF cofactors and polyglutamatable antifolates (for reviews see [202, 203]). Based upon this capacity to cleave antifolate polyglutamate tails, one could predict that the expression of high GGH levels would result in decreased antifolate activity due to the decreased ability of cells to accumulate antifolate polyglutamates, thereby resulting in the ATP-driven efflux of antifolate monogluta-mates via MRPs and BCRP [11] (Fig. 4). However, increased GGH activity will also result in enhanced hydrolysis of folate polyglutamates thereby resulting in the contraction of the intracellular folate pool; this in turn would bring about an increased sensitivity to antifolates. The results of some experiments support the notion that increased GGH activity results in a net increase in MTX resistance. In earlier preclinical studies, the inherent resistance of several sarcoma cell lines to MTX [193] was associated with increased GGH activity [204]. Accordingly, since both the liver and kidney express high levels of GGH, hepatocellular and renal cell carcinomas may present an increased antifolate resistance. In this respect, perhaps the best characterized antifolate-resistant cell line with enhanced GGH activity is H35D rat hepatoma cells [205]. Relative to parental cells, this lometrexol-selected cell line displayed a 7-fold increased GGH activity associated with an 80-fold acquired resistance to this selecting agent and cross-resistance to MTX. H35D cells also exhibited a 90% decrease in the formation of MTX polyglutamates in the absence of alterations in FPGS activity; the parent monoglutamate form of MTX was the predominant intracellular species [206]. Unlike antifolates, the total cellular folate pool was identical in both parental H35 and H35D cells grown in medium containing folic acid concentrations at the range of 2.3–10 μM. Therefore, the impact of enhanced GGH activity on cellular THF cofactor polyglutamates is much less prominent than that on antifolates. However, the antifolate-resistance phenotype in H35D cells should be regarded as multifactorial since these drug-resistant cells also displayed a marked impairment of antifolate uptake.
The unavailability of a cell line containing enhanced GGH activity as the sole mechanism of antifolate-resistance led to more direct experiments in which a cDNA encoding the human GGH was introduced into human HT1080 fibrosarcoma and MCF-7 breast cancer cells [207]. Thus, transfectant cells stably overexpressing GGH activity by a factor of 15–97 showed altered MTX accumulation and metabolism to long-chain polyglutamates. However, in contrast to the initial prediction, this marked GGH overexpression did not confer resistance to short pulses of MTX. This unexpected result may possibly be due to some specific alterations and/or adaptations including decreased intracellular folate pools as observed in these transfected cell lines. It is reasonable to suggest that high level ectopic overexpression of GGH may be detrimental to proliferating cells unless some adaptive alterations have been acquired [203]. The authors of the above ectopic GGH overexpression study concluded that, at least for these two GGH-transfected model cell lines, marked elevation of GGH activity is not sufficient to produce MTX resistance [207]. Moreover, GGH activity in multiple human CCRF-CEM leukemia cell lines with acquired resistance to a wide spectrum of antifolates that target various folate-dependent enzymes was not elevated [126].

At the clinic, an early study demonstrated that patients with metastatic breast cancer had increased plasma levels of GGH when compared to control counterparts or patients that underwent surgical resection of the tumors [208]. Galivan [202] extended this study and found that breast and liver cancer specimens showed a much higher expression of GGH than their normal counterparts. Furthermore, the formation of MTX polyglutamylates in lymphoblasts from childhood ALL could be best predicted by the ratio of GGH to FPGS. This result suggests that GGH may possibly be a determinant of human tumor sensitivity to MTX [209]. Relative to common/pre-B ALL, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) specimens had a threefold increased GGH activity which may be correlated with the inherent MTX resistance of AML due to decreased formation of MTX polyglutamates [210]. Recently it was found that CpG island methylation of the human GGH promoter is associated with a significantly reduced GGH mRNA expression and catalytic activity as well as with a prominently higher accumulation of long-chain MTX polyglutamates (MTX-Glu4–7) in 15% of patient specimens with nonhyperdiploid B-lineage ALL [211]. Specifically, two CpG islands (termed CpG1 and CpG2) were identified that underwent methylation in a region extending from the GGH promoter through the first exon into the first intron. The methylation of the upstream CpG1 was leukemia-cell specific and had a prominent impact on GGH expression. In contrast, methylation of the downstream CpG2 was frequent in leukemia cells and in normal leukocytes but had no significant effect

on GGH expression. These novel findings suggest that GGH activity in ALL is also regulated by epigenetic changes, which may contribute to inter-individual differences in GGH expression, thereby resulting in alterations in cellular polyglutamylation of MTX and responsiveness to MTX-containing chemotherapy. Moreover, several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been identified in the human GGH gene including both the promoter and the coding regions [212]. One of the polymorphisms in the coding region, Thr127Ile, has been associated with decreased GGH activity in hyperdiploid B- and T-lineage ALL cells; this was correlated with increased accumulation of long-chain MTX polyglutamates [213]. However, although GGH promoter polymorphisms were associated with altered GGH expression, these led to enhanced rather than decreased GGH expression [212]. Collectively, these recent encouraging results support the further exploration of the role of GGH activity in the resistance of human cancers to MTX and other polyglutamatable antifolates.

### 2.7 Expansion of intracellular THF cofactor pools

Recent studies have clearly shown that expansion or contraction of the intracellular pool of reduced folate derivatives can dramatically alter the cytotoxic activity of some antifolates [31, 92, 214–218]. Thus, progressive deprivation of oxidized (i.e. folic acid) and reduced folate cofactors (e.g. leucovorin) from the growth medium of cultured mammalian cells resulted in a contraction of the intracellular THF cofactor pool. However, replacement of the folate-poor medium with a folate-rich medium resulted in a marked increase in the intracellular THF cofactor pool; this in turn brought about a decreased cytotoxicity of certain antifolates thereby leading to antifolate resistance [31, 92, 219]. The expansion of the intracellular folate pool resulted in a marked increase in antifolate resistance, particularly to hydrophilic antifolates that depend on polyglutamylation for their pharmacological activity [92, 216, 218]. There are several biochemical mechanisms underlying antifolate resistance due to expanded intracellular folate pools: (a) Upon inhibition of DHFR activity by antifolates like MTX, THF cofactors are rapidly oxidized to DHF. As such, expansion of the intracellular THF pool will necessarily result in a marked accumulation of DHF, given that DHFR is continuously inhibited. DHF, the natural high affinity substrate of DHFR, will then efficiently compete with the inhibitory antifolate at the level of this enzyme. The consequently decreased inhibition of DHFR will then bring about a suppression of the cytotoxic activity of the antifolate thereby resulting in antifolate resistance. Clearly, the more potent DHFR inhibition, the lesser the impact of the expansion of intracellular folate pool on antifolate resistance. (b) The augmented intracellular THF cofactorpool strongly decreases the extent of formation of antifolate polyglutamates. This occurs due to a competition of both DHF and THF cofactors with the polyglutamatable antifolate at the level of FPGS. Hence, expansion of intracellular folate pools, either due to the loss of expression and function of folate efflux pumps including MRPs and BCRP (Fig. 6) [92, 220] and increased influx of folic acid due to mutations in the RFC which highly increase its affinity for folic acid [31, 32, 218], results in antifolate resistance, particularly to antifolates that require polyglutamylation for their cytotoxic activity. Consistently, antifolates such as PT523, which most potently inhibit DHFR and cannot undergo polyglutamylation (due to the lack of a glutamate moiety), retain their cytotoxic activity even when the intracellular folate pool is markedly expanded. In contrast, increased cellular THF cofactor pools markedly decreased trimetrexate activity [92, 221]; inasmuch as trimetrexate cannot undergo polyglutamylation, this finding is in accord with the relatively poorer DHFR affinity of trimetrexate when compared to that of the parent drug MTX [50] or other potent DHFR inhibitors like PT523. Plevitrexed, a potent TS inhibitor and a nonpolyglutamatable antifolate also retained its original cytotoxic activity in cells with an expanded folate pool; this is consistent with the lack of competition between this antifolate and 5,10-CH₂-THF at the level of the target enzyme, TS [30].

In a dedicated study, the impact of the intracellular folate pool size on the cytotoxic activity of multiple antifolates was systematically explored in murine L1210 leukemia cells grown in different concentrations of leucovorin as the sole folate source [222]. The cellular folate pool increased in proportion to the rise in the extracellular concentration of leucovorin. As the THF cofactor pool size increased, the 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC₅₀) for the polyglutamatable antifolates lometrexol, pemetrexed and raltitrexed markedly increased. This appeared to result from a significant suppression of the formation of antifolate polyglutamates. The lower the affinity of the antifolate monoglutamate for the target enzyme (and FPGS), the higher the adverse effect of the expanded folate pool on the pharmacological activity of the antifolate.

### 2.8 The molecular basis of expansion of intracellular THF cofactor pools

RFC, the dominant influx transporter for THF cofactors is an equilibrative, non-concentrative transporter which functions as an anion exchanger. As such, a significant expansion in the intracellular THF cofactor pool is likely to be associated with the loss of major efflux pathway(s) of cellular THF cofactors (Fig. 6). As discussed above, the most dominant and potent (anti)folate efflux transporters are members of the ABCC (i.e. MRP1 through MRP5) and ABCG families (BCRP) [11, 71, 223]. Hence, *in vitro* and *in vivo* evidence have accumulated to suggest that loss of MRP1, MRP2, MRP5 and BCRP is an important determinant of expansion of intracellular folate pools (Fig. 6). Conversely, overexpression of one of these ATP-dependent efflux transporters may result in decreased intracellular THF cofactor pools. Whereas the mechanistic basis for the expansion of intracellular THF cofactor pools that is due to loss of MRPs and BCRP function has been recently discussed in greater detail [11], selected examples are brought below. First, an early study with Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) Pyrᴿ¹⁰⁰ cells [221] subjected to a gradual deprivation of folates by stepwise selection to the lipophilic antifolate pyrimethamine showed a complete loss of MRP1 and a marked decrease in MRP5 [224]. The absence of MRP1 and MRP5 along with the lack of a significant expression of other MRPs, led to a 5-fold decrease in the ATP-dependent efflux of folic acid [92, 224]. Consequently, the loss of folate efflux resulted in a 17-fold increase in the free intracellular pool of folic acid [92]. These cells consistently displayed an extraordinary ability to grow on medium containing only 100 pM leucovorin as the sole folate source. Second, human CCRF-CEM-7A leukemia T-cells gradually deprived of leucovorin from the growth medium displayed a nearly complete loss of MRP1 expression along with a dramatic overexpression of the RFC [219, 220]. As CCRF-CEM-7A cells are devoid of MRP2, MRP3 and BCRP, express only low levels of MRP4 and MRP5 and in addition essentially lack MRP1, the folate efflux capability has been largely lost in these cells.

Fig. 6 Schematic representation of the putative impact of expression status of ATP-driven folate efflux transporters on the intracellular folate pool size
Indeed, CCRF-CEM-7A cells exhibit a 5-fold reduction in the folic acid efflux rate constant relative to parental CCRF-CEM cells. Consequently, CCRF-CEM-7A cells acquired a highly augmented reduced folate influx via the overexpressed RFC which could not be counteracted by any of the marginally expressed MRPs. This resulted in a major enhancement of the cellular folate pool; the net cellular pools of folic acid and leucovorin after 30 min accumulation with tritiated folates at an extracellular folate concentration of 1 μM were 15- and 26-fold higher than in parental cells, respectively [220]. This was reflected in a 68-fold decrease in the folic acid growth requirement relative to parental cells. Third, naturally occurring THF cofactors including THF, 5-CH₃-THF, 5,10-CH₂-THF and 5-CHO-THF (leucovorin) were originally found to be effluxed by rat liver MRP2 (ABCC2) also known as canalicular MOAT (cMOAT) [93]. In this study, the ATP-dependent transport of the dominant circulatory reduced folate 5-CH₃-THF showed a Km of 121 μM in CMV isolated from wild type SD rats. In contrast, in the model of EHBR, rats that are deficient in MRP2 function due to a hereditary defect, the transport of the above THF cofactors into the bile was severely impaired or completely absent. These experiments demonstrate the functional role that loss of MRPs may have on cellular folate homeostasis, intracellular folate pool and adaptation to conditions of folate deficiency. Hence, expansion of the intracellular folate pool has a dramatic effect on the resistance to polyglutamylation-dependent antifolates.

polyglutamylation mediated by FPGS. In contrast to the large body of literature available on the multiple modalities of MTX resistance, very little is known regarding the ability of 7-OH MTX to provoke antifolate-resistance phenomena that may disrupt MTX activity. This point was directly addressed in a recent study in which human leukemia CCRF-CEM and MOLT-4 cells were selected for resistance to 7-OH MTX and to the parent drug MTX [231]. 7-OH MTX-selected cells exhibited 10-fold resistance to the selecting agent 7-OH MTX and 100-fold cross-resistance to MTX. Remarkably however, acquired resistance to 7-OH MTX was due to a 95% loss of FPGS activity and consequently defective antifolate polyglutamylation, while retaining an intact antifolate transport via the RFC. As such, 7-OH MTX would presumably remain in the monoglutamate form thereby being a good candidate for efflux via MDR efflux transporters including BCRP and possibly MRP1 through MRP5; indeed, recently it was shown that 7-OH MTX is readily exported by BCRP [232]. In contrast, an identical selection protocol of CCRF-CEM and MOLT-4 human leukemia cells with the parent drug MTX resulted in an antifolate-resistance that was based on a 10-fold decrease in RFC transport activity. Hence, these findings establish a novel paradigm that the metabolite 7-OH MTX which exceeds by far MTX in the plasma of HD-MTX treated patients can provoke distinct modalities of antifolate-resistance that severely compromise the efficacy of the parent drug MTX. It should be noted that the antifolate-resistance phenotype *in vivo* may be comprised from both MTX- and 7-OH MTX-provoked mechanisms of resistance including defective inward transport as well as impaired polyglutamylation. These findings have potentially important implications for the emergence of metabolite-provoked resistance to other antifolates and anticancer drugs that undergo metabolism to a predominant cytotoxic species.

## 3 Novel mechanisms of antifolate resistance

### 3.1 Metabolite-induced antifolate resistance

MTX undergoes oxidation to its primary metabolite 7-hydroxy-MTX (7-OH MTX) in the liver by the enzyme aldehyde oxidase [225]. The ratios of the plasma concentrations of 7-OH MTX to MTX 28 hr, 42 hr and 66 hr after HD-MTX infusion in children with ALL were respectively, 2.4, 8.7 and 15.1 [226, 227]. Hence, the plasma concentration of 7-OH-MTX is by far the most dominant antifolate species already at 42 h after infusion. Like its parent drug MTX, cellular influx of 7-OH MTX is primarily mediated via the RFC with a remarkably similar transport Km when compared to MTX (Kt=9 μM for 7-OH MTX versus 5 μM for MTX) [228]. Moreover, once transported into cultured tumor cells, the rate of 7-OH MTX polyglutamylation exceeds that of MTX by 3-fold at equimolar extracellular concentrations [228, 229]. This is consistent with 7-OH MTX being as good an FPGS substrate as is MTX [230]. Hence, 7-OH MTX can compete with MTX and THF cofactors for the uptake via the RFC as well as on

### 3.2 Loss of isoprenylcysteine carboxyl methyltransferase (ICMT) and antifolate resistance

MTX and other antifolates are potent antagonists of folate metabolism and exert their cytotoxic activity via inhibition of *de novo* nucleotide biosynthesis thereby blocking DNA replication [1, 10, 11]. Recently it was discovered that MTX can also target the Ras signaling pathway via inhibition of a specific methyltransferase known as isoprenylcysteine carboxyl methyltransferase (ICMT) [233]. Inhibition of folate metabolism by MTX increases the levels of homocysteine [234], a compound associated with an increased risk of heart disease, Alzheimer disease [235] and neural tube defects [236]. The presumed mechanism of homocysteine toxicity is cellular hypomethylation due to an increase in S-adenosylhomocysteine [237], an inhibitor of methyltransferases including ICMT. Among the various
substrates of ICMT are also monomeric G proteins including Ras, a central component of signaling pathways regulating cell growth, differentiation and proliferation. A prerequisite for the proper plasma membrane targeting and function of Ras is carboxyl methylation [238]. Hence, abrogation of this crucial post-translational modification by MTX results in the loss of various Ras-dependent signaling processes and consequent cessation of DNA synthesis [233]. Consistently, certain cell lines that are devoid of ICMT display a high level resistance to MTX. Hence, inhibition of ICMT is a critical component of the cytotoxic effect exerted by MTX in certain cells, thereby expanding our understanding of the various determinants of MTX cytotoxicity and antifolate-resistance. This novel determinant of MTX cytotoxicity and antifolate-resistance has been recently reviewed in greater detail [11].

4 Novel approaches to overcome antifolate-resistance

4.1 Restoring RFC expression and antifolate-sensitivity in drug-resistant tumor cells

The loss of RFC gene expression was clearly established in multiple human tumor cell lines that acquired resistance to various antifolates that target different folate-dependent enzymes [33, 105]. The predominant molecular basis underlying this loss of RFC gene expression was found to be transcriptional silencing due to loss of function of transcription factors including CREB-1 and Sp1, both of which are essential for RFC gene expression [105, 106, 109, 110]. Moreover, at least in one inherently MTX-resistant cell line, transcriptional silencing was due to RFC promoter methylation [103]. As discussed above, it was recently found that loss of function of these transcription factors was due to alterations in phosphorylation that could be reversed by treatment with various agonists of the protein kinase A (PKA) pathway including forskolin and di-butyryl-cAMP [107]. Likewise, in antifolate-resistant cells with loss of Sp1 function due to inhibitory phosphorylation, treatment with 8-pCPT-cGMP resulted in the ablation of this inhibitory phosphorylation due to activation of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), thereby restoring RFC gene expression [109]. Collectively, these pre-clinical findings suggest that acquired resistance of human tumors to various antifolates due to loss of RFC gene expression may be reversed by co-treatment with well-tolerated agonists such as cAMP and cGMP analogues. In the case of promoter methylation, co-treatment with 5-deoxy-aza-cytidine, an established inhibitor of DNA methyltransferase, may prove effective in reactivating transcription of the RFC gene [103]. These novel treatments could possibly restore antifolate-sensitivity in drug-resistant tumors.

4.2 Increasing FRα and FRβ expression as novel means of antifolate-based targeted therapies

Recently it was shown that FRα can be transcriptionally up-regulated by the glucocorticoid receptor agonist dexamethasone [239]. This dexamethasone effect was mediated by GC-rich (i.e. Sp1 binding) element in the core P4 promoter. Moreover, histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors potentiated dexamethasone induction of FRα. These novel results support the concept that selective induction of FRα gene expression in combination with well-tolerated HDAC inhibitors will increase the efficacy of various FRα-dependent therapeutic (e.g. antifolate-based) applications. Consistently, FRβ gene expression was synergistically induced by all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and HDAC inhibitors in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) cells [240]. Therefore, the combination of ATRA and innocuous HDAC inhibitors may be expected to facilitate selective FRβ-targeted therapies in AML.

4.3 Targeting FRα as means of overcoming antifolate-resistance based on impaired drug uptake

As mentioned above, BGC945, a novel antifolate has been recently synthesized that potently targets TS (Ki=1.2 nM) and is efficiently taken up into cells solely via FRα but not through the RFC, thereby potentially overcoming impaired antifolate transport due to alterations in the RFC [35]. Consequently, this antifolate can selectively target human tumors such as ovarian cancers that highly overexpress FRα thereby avoiding cytotoxic side effects to most normal tissues that ubiquitously express the RFC but not FRα. Furthermore, antifolate-resistant tumor cells with impaired drug uptake due to loss of expression or inactivation of the RFC may be readily eradicated by agents such as BGC945 that have an extremely poor affinity for the RFC. It should be emphasized that the lack of significant FRα gene expression should not pose a serious chemotherapeutic obstacle as FRα expression can be restored or enhanced by agents such as dexamethasone and HDAC inhibitors (see the previous section).

4.4 Use of novel antifolates with superior transport and polyglutamylation characteristics to overcome antifolate-resistance

Pralatrexate (10-propargyl-10-deaza-aminopterin; PDX) is the prototype of a new class of antifolates that belongs to a family of folate antimetabolites known as 10-deaza-aminopterins which potently inhibit DHFR [24, 241]. These antifolates were structurally designed to have a superior transport affinity for the RFC as well as high affinity for FPGS when compared with MTX. Specifically, thetransport Km values of the RFC for pralatrexate and MTX are 0.3 and 4.8 μM, respectively, whereas the Vmax/Km ratios are ~13 and 0.9, respectively, in cultured tumor cells. Hence, the rate of inward transport of pralatrexate is nearly 14-fold higher than for MTX. Moreover, the Km values of pralatrexate and MTX for FPGS are 5.9 and 32 μM, respectively, whereas the Vmax/Km ratios of these antifolates for FPGS are 5.9- and 32.3, respectively. These superior biochemical characteristics suggest a much greater cytotoxic potential of pralatrexate than MTX. Indeed, the effects of pralatrexate and MTX were evaluated in parallel in both multiple non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma cell lines as well as *in vivo* with mice bearing either human diffuse large cell HT lymphoma or transformed follicular RL lymphoma overexpressing bcl-2 [242, 243]. All these studies consistently found pralatrexate to be superior to MTX in human non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. These encouraging findings provided the basis for a single-agent phase I/II study of pralatrexate in patients with multiply relapsed and refractory aggressive non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. This clinical study revealed an intriguing activity of pralatrexate that induced durable complete remissions in patients with a diversity of advanced-stage drug-resistant (including MTX-resistant) T-cell lymphomas with toxicity (stomatitis) that could be abrogated with folic acid and vitamin B12 [244, 245]. Clinical studies are underway to expand the population of patients with T-cell and B-cell lymphomas. In this respect, antifolates (i.e. MTX) and cytidine analogues have had a time-honored role in the chemotherapy of various kinds of lymphoproliferative malignancies; for example, MTX, leucovorin and cytarabine (ara C) were the major components of combination chemotherapy for the treatment of advanced diffuse histiocytic lymphoma [246]. Consistently, recently it was found that the combination of pralatrexate followed by the novel cytidine analogue gemcitabine (2′,2′-difluorodeoxycytidine) was clearly superior to the standard combination of MTX/ara C *in vitro* as well as *in vivo* with mouse models bearing xenografts of human Non-hodgkin’s lymphomas. Hence, based upon the durable complete remissions induced by pralatrexate in patients with T-cell lymphomas [244, 245], it is conceivable that such a schedule of pralatrexate followed by gemcitabine could synergize to achieve even greater curative effects than pralatrexate alone including the overcoming of antifolate-resistance phenomena.

### 4.5 Pemetrexed-dependent overcoming of MTX-resistance due to loss of RFC function

Recently it was found that a MTX-resistant HeLa subline (R5) with a profoundly impaired MTX transport due to a genomic deletion of the RFC locus surprisingly retained sensitivity to pemetrexed but was extremely resistant to both raltitrexed and PT523 [129]. Consistently, stable transfection of the human RFC cDNA into R5 cells restored sensitivity to MTX, raltitrexed and PT523, thereby establishing that RFC-dependent transport defect was the mechanism underlying antifolate resistance. Hence, the remarkable retention of pemetrexed sensitivity in HeLa R5 cells was associated with a residual transport by the low pH folate transporter that exhibited a good transport affinity for pemetrexed (Km=12 μM) but low or poor affinity for raltitrexed, MTX and PT523 (Ki values of 90, 100, 250 μM, respectively, using radiolabeled pemetrexed as a transport substrate). Hence, since loss of RFC transport function is a frequent mechanism of MTX-resistance *in vitro* and *in vivo* including in ALL, osteosarcoma and PCNSL after HD-MTX-based chemotherapy, one novel strategy to overcome this modality of MTX resistance would be to use antifolates such as pemetrexed that have a good affinity for the low pH folate transporter. Indeed, monitoring the expression levels and function of this low pH folate transporter in tumor cells would become feasible due to the recent cloning of this transporter (see the section below). These findings support the future synthesis and/or screening for new antifolates that display an increased affinity (i.e. better than does pemetrexed) for the low pH folate transporter. Such future antifolates could efficiently target MTX-resistant cancer cells that have lost RFC transport activity, thereby resulting in an efficient eradication of these drug-resistant cells.

### 4.6 Targeting the proton-coupled folate transporter (PCFT) for antifolate uptake in the acidic environment of solid tumors

After submitting the present review, a key paper appeared on the identification and characterization of a proton-coupled folate transporter (PCFT/HCP1/SLC46A1) [247]; PCFT was previously known, and thus referred to in the current paper, as the low pH folate transporter [61–63, 129]. Importantly, an inactivating mutation in the PCFT gene was found to be the molecular basis for hereditary folate malabsorption (OMIM 229050) [248]; the latter is a rare recessive familial disorder characterized by signs and symptoms of folate deficiency with a disease onset a few months after birth. Inflicted infants exhibit very low blood and cerebrospinal fluid folate levels typically associated with anemia, diarrhea, immune deficiency, infections and neurological deficits [248]. These patients display a profound defect in intestinal folate absorption. One of the most remarkable characteristics of PCFT is that it functions as a proton-driven, high-affinity folate influx transporter (e.g. Km=0.5 μM for 5-methyl-THF) with optimal activity at acidic pH (pH 5.5). Likewise, PCFT exhibits good transport affinities for MTX (Km=3.4 μM) and pemetrexed (Km=12 μM) but a poor affinity for other antifolates including
PT523 (Ki=250 μM). Hence, from a pharmacological perspective, PCFT could possibly play a key role in the uptake of certain antifolates (e.g., MTX and pemetrexed) into the acidic lumen of solid tumors [249, 250]. In this respect, under physiological conditions, substantial PCFT gene expression was detected in various organs of epithelial origin including kidney, liver, placenta, small intestine, and spleen and to somewhat lower extent in colon and testis [247]. Furthermore, colon cancer and cervical carcinoma cell lines also expressed substantial levels of PCFT mRNA. Therefore, based on "lead compounds" like MTX and pemetrexed which are good transport substrates of PCFT, one could possibly design novel antifolates that target PCFT with a better transport affinity and thus could be efficiently delivered into the acidic interior of these malignant tumors. This could be of particular importance in tumors that express or overexpress PCFT and/or in antifolate-resistant neoplasms in which RFC was inactivated or down-regulated. Alternatively, a novel antifolate pro-drug could be rationally-designed that upon protonation in the acidic interior of malignant tumors may become a high affinity transport substrate for PCFT thereby achieving a selective intratumoral drug delivery.
