ABSTRACT  

The vast majority of cytokine signaling is mediated by “shared”  
receptors that form central signaling components of higher-order  
complexes incorporating ligand-specific receptors. These include the com-  
mon $\gamma$ chain ($\gamma_{c}$), common $\beta$ chain ($\beta_{c}$), and gp130, as well as others.  
These receptors have the dual tasks of cross-reactive cytokine recognition,  
and formation of precisely oriented multimeric signaling assemblies.  
Currently, detailed structural information on a shared receptor complex  
exists only for gp130, which is a highly pleiotropic shared cytokine  
signaling receptor essential for mammalian cell growth and homeostasis.  
To date, more than 10 different four-helix bundle ligands have been  
identified that incorporate gp130, or one of its close relatives such as LIF  
receptor, into functional oligomeric signaling complexes. In this review  
we summarize our current knowledge of shared receptor recognition  
and activation, with a focus on gp130. We discuss recent structural and  
functional information to analyze overall architectural assemblies of gp130

# CROSS-REACTIVE SIGNALING RECEPTORS IN BIOLOGY

The formation of high-affinity, ligand-mediated extracellular signaling complexes has emerged as a central paradigm in biology. This initial step in cellular communication is followed by the activation of intracellular signaling cascades, which are directly related to the composition and architectural assembly of the extracellular complexes. Although highly specific ligand/receptor interactions can provide the tight regulation necessary to maintain control of physiological responses, many receptor systems exhibit an extraordinary degree of cross-reactivity, which can result in a redundancy beneficial for survival of the organism. In fact, one might argue that with the emergence of the human genome sequence, we are finding that most receptor systems have the capacity to recognize and respond to more than one ligand. There are many examples of degenerate, shared receptors with central roles in signaling. In neurobiology, the p75 neurotrophin receptor (Dechant and Barde, 2002), the RET receptor for GDNF (Anders *et al.*, 2001), the Nogo receptor (GrandPre *et al.*, 2002), and others each have a variety of diverse ligands that can evoke distinct signaling pathways. In the immune system, shared receptors exist in both adaptive (T cell receptors, co-stimulatory receptors B7/CD28) and innate immunity (NKG2D natural killer receptor, scavenger, and pattern recognition receptors such as RAGE and Toll) (Strong, 2002). The cross-reactivity of T-cell receptors is an essential feature of their dual ability to both recognize and avoid self antigens as well as destroy foreign pathogens (Mason, 1998). Chemokine G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR) can exhibit an extraordinary degeneracy in chemokine recognition (Gong *et al.*, 1996). However, perhaps in no other system are shared receptors as integral to mammalian biology as seen for cytokines (Nicola, 1994; Taga and Kishimoto, 1995). Given its emerging importance, a clearer understanding of the biochemical and structural factors associated with receptor-ligand degeneracy is needed for a more comprehensive understanding of cellular communication. Gp130 is one of the most ubiquitous and important shared signaling receptors for cytokines, mediating the actions of more than 10 known ligands so far, each of which initiates both redundant and unique signaling outcomes (Bravo and Heath, 2000; Grotzinger *et al.*, 1999; Rose-John, 2002; Simpson *et al.*, 1997; Taga and Kishimoto, 1997). The past year has seen significant progress in obtaining structural information of gp130 in complex with different cytokine ligands (Boulanger *et al.*, 2003a,b). Also, new members of the gp130-class

of cytokines are emerging from bioinformatics cloning approaches (Trinchieri *et al.*, 2003). In this review we take advantage of this recent structural information to study the use of a common assembly template among the higher order gp130 signaling complexes. We also probe in detail the structural basis for the extraordinary degree of cross-reactivity of gp130. The principles derived from structural analysis of gp130-ligand interactions may have some translational relevance to understanding the cross-reactive properties of other shared receptors.

At the outset of this review, we apologize that we are unable to cite all contributors to our understanding of this field in our review because of space constraints. We refer the reader to many excellent reviews on various aspects of cytokine structure, receptor interaction, and signaling (Bravo *et al.*, 1998; Davies and Wlodawer, 1995; de Vos *et al.*, 1992; Heinrich *et al.*, 2003; Kossiakoff and De Vos, 1998; Rose-John, 2002; Wells and de Vos, 1996; Wilson and Jolliffe, 1999).

## II. CYTOKINES AND RECEPTORS

Hematopoietic cytokines comprise one of the largest groups of extracellular regulatory molecules and are key mediators of a diverse spectrum of physiological functions that include induction of immune responses, cell proliferation, and differentiation (Cosman, 1993; Cosman *et al.*, 1990; Kishimoto *et al.*, 1994; Nicola and Hilton, 1998; Taga and Kishimoto, 1992). The defining structural feature of the hematopoietic class of cytokines is a four-helix bundle motif organized into four anti-parallel helices that adopt an up-up-down-down motif (Bazan, 1990a; Sprang and Bazan, 1993). Structural predictions, later confirmed by several crystal and NMR structures, indicated that the four-helix bundle cytokines could be further sub-classified based on lengths of the helices (Davies and Wlodawer, 1995). The most common group is the long chain cytokines (10 to 20 residues), or type I cytokines, which include human growth hormone (GH), erythropoietin (EPO), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and the gp130 cytokines (Simpson *et al.*, 1997). The second class is the short chain cytokines with helices of 8 to 10 residues in length that include interleukins 2, 3, and 4. The third and final group of cytokines are formed by tandem four-helix bundle motifs to generate an eight-helix bundle architecture (Sprang and Bazan, 1993) and includes interleukin 5 and interferon gamma (Davies and Wlodawer, 1995; Walter, 2002). While this latter group is not strictly classified as “hematopoietic,” they share highly related structural features and can be grouped as a whole with the hematopoietic cytokines to compose a large family of four-helix
bundle cytokines with many redundant functions. In this review, we restrict our focus to the hematopoietic members.

Cytokines mediate their functional effects through a wide variety of signaling receptors that are generally classified into one of six major families based on common structural features that include secondary structure and conserved amino acid motifs (Bazan, 1990a,b; Cosman, 1993). The largest of these families is the hematopoietic receptor superfamily that is characterized by a cytokine binding homology region, or CHR, formed from tandem fibronectin repeats (Wells and de Vos, 1996). The amino terminal CHR domain contains four conserved cysteine residues and the carboxy terminal domain encodes a conserved WSXWS tryptophan motif (Bazan, 1990b; de Vos *et al.*, 1992) (Fig. 1). Mutagenesis studies have shown a structural role for these amino acids in maintaining the ternary structure and ligand recognition properties of the receptor (Yawata *et al.*, 1993). These structural features have been used successfully to identify and clone new hematopoietic receptors (Elson *et al.*, 1998; Mosley *et al.*, 1996; Sprecher *et al.*, 1998). Together, the four-helix cytokine and the corresponding CHR in the receptors comprise the basic building blocks of the cytokine world.

### III. THE GROWTH HORMONE PARADIGM: GENERALITIES AND LIMITATIONS

The structural basis for cytokine ligand-receptor association was initially defined from extensive structural, biochemical, and functional studies of human growth hormone (*de Vos et al.*, 1992; Kossiakoff and De Vos, 1998; Wells, 1996). The crystal structure of GH in complex with the human growth hormone receptor (GHR) (*de Vos et al.*, 1992) represented the first structure of a four-helix bundle cytokine in complex with its receptor (Fig. 1). Briefly, the assembly of the GH/GHR complex is mediated by two topologically distinct epitopes, termed *sites I* and *II*, on GH that engage the CHR domains of two identical receptor subunits. Sites I and II are located on opposite sides of GH, with site I formed by the B and D helical faces while site II is located on the A and C helical faces. The homodimerization of two receptors by a single cytokine, using different epitopes on the cytokine, but largely similar residues on the receptor, was completely unexpected. This complex established a structural linkage between the four-helix bundle cytokine, and the receptor CHR that can be found in all other cytokine receptor complexes. Following this assembly, specific tyrosine residues on the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor are

FIG. 1. Grouping of hematopoietic cytokine receptors by shared receptor usage. The majority of the hematopoietic cytokine receptors incorporate one of three shared signaling receptors, either the common beta ($\beta_{c}$) chain, the common gamma ($\gamma_{c}$) chain or gp130. The crystal structure of the growth hormone (red) complex (inset) was the first structure of a four helix bundle cytokine in complex with its receptor (green) (de Vos *et al.*, 1992) and established the paradigm of cytokine/receptor complex formation.

phosphorylated and become docking sites for transcriptional regulatory molecules such as the STAT family of transcription factors (Heinrich *et al.*, 1998; Ihle, 1995). The nature of the transcriptional regulation is dictated directly by the identity of the cytokine and receptor and the orientational geometry of the final signaling complex (Constantinescu *et al.*, 2001). This has been most clearly observed with the EPO system (Livnah *et al.*, 1996), where mimics of EPO, and EPO itself, are able to homodimerize the erythropoietin receptor (EPOR) but have altered signaling capacities that seem to be correlated with the dimeric “angular orientation” of the receptors in the different complexes (Livnah *et al.*, 1998; Syed *et al.*, 1998). The implication is that the variable dimerization angles are relayed through the membrane to induce varied intracellular signaling outcomes (Seubert *et al.*, 2003; Wells, 1996; Wells and de Vos, 1996).

Although GH represents the simplest cytokine system, containing only a single class of receptor (similar to EPO and thrombopoietin [TPO], etc.), it established ligand-induced receptor homodimerization as the cytokine receptor signaling mechanism. At a gross structural level, all of the receptors shown in Fig. 1 use either a site I, site II, or combined I/II interaction mode with their cytokines as part of the higher-order signaling complexes (Davies and Wlodawer, 1995; de Vos *et al.*, 1992; Grotzinger, 2002). While the cytokine receptor complexes to date (IL-4, IL-10, IL-12, EPO, γ-INF, etc.) recapitulate aspects of the modular architecture originally seen in the GH complex, similarities at the atomic level are less apparent. In other words, the GH complex revealed a gross docking topology, but each cytokine receptor pair uses divergent receptor-cytokine contacts, which prevent us from simply modeling the complexes based on the GH example (Walter, 2002). In fact, the other cytokine-receptor complexes have revealed significant variations in the docking geometries and interaction chemistries, which highlight the structural richness remaining in examining other complexes. The relationship of cytokine-receptor complexes to the GH example is similar in nature to the situation of T cell receptor/MHC interactions. The first complex structures established a roughly “diagonal” docking topology of the TCR on the MHC, but subsequent complex structures have revealed many unpredictable variations on this theme (Rudolph and Wilson, 2002). Detailed information on cytokine-receptor interactions still requires direct structural analysis. It is also important to remember that only a minority of cytokines signal by the GH homodimerization mechanism. Most other cytokine systems require a more complicated signaling assembly that incorporates different receptors, and binding epitopes to form a hetero-oligomeric signaling complex.

CYTOKINE RECOGNITION BY A SHARED SIGNALING RECEPTOR 113

IV. SHARED SIGNALING RECEPTORS FOR HEMATOPOIETIC CYTOKINES

The vast majority of cytokines utilize combinations of monogamous and promiscuous receptors (Bagley *et al.*, 1995; Leonard *et al.*, 1994; Nicola, 1994; Taga and Kishimoto, 1995). Cytokines and their receptors can be classified based on their ligand-receptor pairing and usage of a limited set of shared receptors (Grotzinger, 2002) (Fig. 1). When grouped by shared receptor usage, we see three (or four, when the IL-10/IFN systems are added) major classes of hematopoietic cytokines: those that utilize the common gamma chain ($\gamma_{c}$), those that utilize common beta chain ($\beta_{c}$), and those within the largest group, the IL-6/IL-12 family that use gp130 and gp130-like shared receptors. These shared receptors are sometimes colloquially referred to as the “tall” (gp130 class) and the “short” ($\gamma_{c}$ and $\beta_{c}$) receptors, and each have major structural differences from one another. In most cases, the shared receptors are used in concert with ligand specific $\alpha$ and/or $\beta$ receptors. The shared receptor has the task of recognizing groups of cytokines with vastly different structural epitopes and converting this recognition event into an intracellular signal. The shared receptor then is required to be promiscuous for different ligand surface chemistries and structures yet specific enough to not cross-react with inappropriate cytokines. Thus these receptors have both recognition and assembly tasks in coordinating with the ligand-specific components of the signaling complexes. It is convenient to discuss these topics separately, but of course both recognition and assembly are intimately interrelated.

A. The Common Gamma Chain: $\gamma_{c}$

The glycoprotein $\gamma_{c}$ is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein that serves as a shared signaling subunit for the receptors of interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-15, and IL-21 (He and Malek, 1998; [Kishimoto, 1995] Leonard *et al.*, 1994; Taga and Kishimoto, 1995) (Fig. 1, partially modeled as part of IL-2 ternary signaling complex in Fig. 2A (Bamborough *et al.*, 1994). The biological importance of $\gamma_{c}$ is most dramatically illustrated by the fact that mutations of either $\gamma_{c}$ or JAK3 are the primary causes of human X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (X-SCID), characterized by a failure in T and natural killer cell development (Theze *et al.*, 1996). The IL-2 receptor (IL-2R) and IL-15R are heterotrimers comprised of unique $\alpha$-chains and shared IL-2R$\beta$ and $\gamma_{c}$ subunits, whereas IL-4R, IL-7R, IL-9R, and IL-21R are heterodimers comprised of unique $\alpha$-subunits and $\gamma_{c}$ (Lai *et al.*, 1996). For each of these cytokine receptors, $\gamma_{c}$ directly contributes to ligand binding through its extracellular domain and to

In this model the γc chain docks against the long axis of IL-2 and also forms contacts with the D2 domain of IL-2Rβ receptor in a similar fashion to the growth hormone structure (de Vos *et al.*, 1992). (B) Structure of the extracellular homodimer of the common βc chain. (Carr *et al.*, 2001). Recent mutagenesis studies have identified the cytokine binding homology region (CHR) to be formed by the A4 domain of one monomer (blue) and the B1 domain of the second monomer (green) to form a composite epitope (shaded cyan region) (Murphy *et al.*, 2003). The cytokine ligand is drawn in red and docked onto the CHR domain.

signal transduction through the association of JAK3 with its cytoplasmic tail (Sugamura *et al.*, 1995).

The structural basis by which γc functions in binding six distinct cytokines is still not defined, although mutagenesis has localized sites of interaction (Olosz and Malek, 2000, 2002). The only member of this family for which a complex structure exists is IL-4 complex, with its alpha receptor (Hage *et al.*, 1999; Mueller *et al.*, 2002). Molecular modeling of the IL-2, IL-4, and IL-7 complexes with γc have been constructed based on assumed analogies with the GH paradigm of a site I and site II epitope on

the cytokine (Bamborough *et al.*, 1994; Gustchina *et al.*, 1995; Kroemer and Richards, 1996; Zurawski *et al.*, 1993). In this case, site I is presumed to interact with the cytokine-specific α-receptor component, whereas site II interacts with γ<sub>c</sub>. For IL-7, which uses a single alpha chain, the trimeric complex with γ<sub>c</sub> was modeled as being highly similar to the GH homodimer topology, with IL-7Rα bound to site I and γ<sub>c</sub> bound to site II (Kroemer and Richards, 1996). The same conclusion was reached for IL-4, which also uses a single Rα. However, for IL-2 and IL-15, the situation is more complicated, since they use a unique Rα as well as an Rβ to form a quaternary signaling complex (Giri *et al.*, 1995; Leonard *et al.*, 1994; Liparoto *et al.*, 2002). Therefore for IL-2 and IL-15, the Rβ has been modeled as the site I binding receptor, keeping site II interaction with γ<sub>c</sub> (Bamborough *et al.*, 1994). The unique Rα, which does not fall into the classical CHR fold of other hematopoietic receptors, has been placed as a “cap” on top of the four-helix bundle (Bamborough *et al.*, 1994). Why IL-2 and IL-15 utilize this structurally unique third receptor component is not known, although precomplexation with Rα is necessary for the subsequent transitions into the quaternary signaling complex. Numerous biochemical and cellular studies, particularly in the IL-2 system, have demonstrated cooperativity in the formation of various intermediate and higher-order forms of the multimeric signaling complexes (Liparoto *et al.*, 2002).

The interactions of γ<sub>c</sub> with its ligands have been probed by mutagenesis based on the crude models of the complexes. Panels of γ<sub>c</sub> mutants in combination with antagonistic antibodies have narrowed down the γ<sub>c</sub> binding site (Olosz and Malek, 2000, 2002; Zhang *et al.*, 2003). γ<sub>c</sub> utilizes a common mechanism for its interactions with multiple cytokines, but the binding sites are largely overlapping yet not identical (Olosz and Malek, 2000, 2002). The functional region of γ<sub>c</sub>, the classical cytokine-binding homology region (CHR), is composed of the EF1, BC2, and FG2 loops projecting out from the intersection between top and bottom β-sandwiches, which is highly similar to other type I cytokine receptors. Analogous ligand binding sites have been found in the corresponding loops of GHR, EPOR, gp130, granulocyte CSFR (G-CSFR), and granulocyte-macrophage (GM-CSFR). From the mutagenesis studies, Asn<sup>128</sup> and Tyr<sup>103</sup> likely act as contact residues with cytokine. Importantly, Tyr<sup>103</sup> of γ<sub>c</sub> is homologous to critical ligand binding sites located in the hydrophobic clusters of GHR (Trp<sup>104</sup>) and EPOR (Phe<sup>93</sup>). Asn128 is located in a “linker” region between the D1 and D2 domains of γ<sub>c</sub> that is not found in other CHR-containing receptors. This linker may allow inter-domain flexibility as an adaptive mechanism to diverse cytokine and receptor components. It has been noted from the structure-function studies that the magnitude of the mutational effects differs for different members of
the $\gamma_{c}$ cytokine family (Olosz and Malek, 2000, 2002; Zhang *et al.*, 2003). For example, mutations of Tyr$^{103}$ appeared to have a more severe effect on the binding of IL-15 than on IL-2. Similarly, the single mutation Asn-128 had a more noticeable effect on IL-7 versus IL-2 and IL-15 binding. The IL-21 epitope comprises $\gamma_{c}$ residues Asn$^{44}$, Tyr$^{103}$, Asn$^{128}$, Leu$^{161}$, Glu$^{162}$, and Leu$^{208}$, which are only partially overlapping with the previously established $\gamma_{c}$ epitope for IL-4 binding. Perhaps Tyr$^{103}$ functions as a structurally conserved anchor residue for cytokine binding, whereas surrounding amino acids such as Asn$^{128}$ may be related to fine specificity in binding for the different cytokines. Such a structural makeup would be consistent with the ‘hotspot’ idea from Wells and colleagues (Clackson and Wells, 1995). The primacy of a central aromatic in enabling cross-reactivity has emerged as a critical feature in gp130 recognition of structurally diverse cytokines (Boulanger *et al.*, 2003a), thus $\gamma_{c}$ and gp130 likely share this property.

In summary, the $\gamma_{c}$ class of cytokines clearly utilizes the site I/II architectural assembly of the GH paradigm as the signaling complex, with some important exceptions such as the role of the sushi-domain in the IL-2 and IL-15R$\alpha$. The precise definition of the chemistry of cross-reactive cytokine recognition in this family remains an important future structural challenge.

### B. The Common Beta Chain: $\beta_{c}$

The $\beta_{c}$ is one of the most enigmatic shared cytokine receptors and is used by GM-CSF, IL-3, and IL-5 (Fig. 1), which are related cytokines involved in the regulation of hematopoiesis and inflammation (Bagley *et al.*, 1995; Nicola *et al.*, 1997; Tavernier *et al.*, 1991). The receptors for the three cytokines consist of cytokine-specific $\alpha$ receptors essential to the activation of the shared $\beta_{c}$ receptor subunit that is believed to be the main signaling entity. Although $\beta_{c}$ does not bind cytokines by itself, its coexpression with the $\alpha$-chains enhances the affinity of cytokine binding. Such a characteristic “affinity conversion” effect is utilized by cytokine shared receptors as a means of imposing tissue specificity. The stoichiometry of the activated receptor complexes and the mechanism of $\beta_{c}$ activation are not definitively known. Crystal structures exist for GM-CSF (Diederichs *et al.*, 1991) and IL-5 (Milburn *et al.*, 1993) but until recently, no X-ray structures were available for the complete extracellular domains of any of the $\alpha$ subunits, the $\beta_{c}$ subunit, or their ligand complexes. In 2001 there was a great achievement in this system with the report of crystal structure of the full-length extracellular domain of $\beta_{c}$ (Carr *et al.*, 2001) (Fig. 2B). Together with a previously determined D4-mAb complex structure(Crossjohn *et al.*, 2000) and mutagenesis information (Woodcock *et al.*, 1994), new insight has been gained into the recognition and signaling mechanisms in this system.

From sequence analysis, the extracellular part of $\beta_{c}$ comprised four FNIII-type domains, forming two contiguous CHR modules, with features especially conserved among cytokine receptors (e.g., the conserved cysteines and WSXWX box). Mutational analysis has localized the cytokine-binding region to residues in the fourth extracellular domain (D4), and in particular the residues Tyr${}^{365}$, His${}^{367}$, Ile${}^{368}$ are crucial for receptor activation (Woodcock *et al.*, 1994). The complex of the D4 with an antagonistic mAb localized the positions of these residues to be in surface exposed strands and loops on the FNIII domain (Rossjohn *et al.*, 2000). Unexpectedly, the structure of the full-length $\beta_{c}$ ectodomain revealed it to be a domain-swapped, head-to-tail intertwined dimer (Carr *et al.*, 2001) (Fig. 2B). Domains 1 and 3 have a very novel feature: their G strands of the beta sheets are unraveled and extended away from its own domain to form the G strand of a fibronectin domain in the other protein chain. The unusual fold in the $\beta_{c}$ receptor structure generates a stable intertwined dimer that is consistent with cellular studies showing the $\beta_{c}$ is a dimer on the cell surface (Carr *et al.*, 2001; Woodcock *et al.*, 1997). In the dimeric structure, the membrane proximal domains are positioned far from one another as a result of the antiparallel dimer orientation forcing the long axis of the dimer to lie almost parallel to the membrane surface (Fig. 2B). The completely unexpected structure of $\beta_{c}$ is without precedent in other cytokine receptors.

Despite the fascinating structure of the unliganded $\beta_{c}$, the mode of interaction with cytokine or $\alpha$ receptor ligands is still not known. The intricate structure of the dimer presents an array of possibilities (Carr *et al.*, 2001). The two domains closest to the membrane on either side of the dimer (domains A1-B4 and B1-A4) adopt the characteristic L-shaped topology of the classical CHR module seen in the growth hormone receptor and related two-domain receptors. However, the interfaces between domains A2 and B3 are also similar to those of cytokine receptors that are activated by homodimerization. Thus the familiar “elbow” of CHR receptors is present in two places in the dimer. However, in both cases the putative interaction side would be formed by joining of two different receptors in the dimer, which would be unprecedented. A recent mutagenesis study appears to solidify the unusual A1-B4 module as the ligand interaction site (Murphy *et al.*, 2003). This would represent the first example of a class I cytokine receptor interface to be composed of two noncontiguous fibronectin III domains. Direct visualization of the architecture of the higher-order signaling assembly and the structural basis forcross-reactive recognition of three cytokines remains to be determined. Clearly, though, the $\beta_{c}$ suggests the possibility of some very interesting structural surprises.

# V. GP130 FAMILY OF CYTOKINES AND RECEPTORS

The only structural information for complex formation by a shared cytokine receptor is for gp130, which is activated by four-helix cytokines known as the “gp130-cytokines” or “IL-6-type cytokines” (Simpson *et al.*, 1997) (Fig. 3). These cytokines generally share a very low sequence homology (10–20%) and so pose an interesting question of how gp130 can recognize each with high affinity. Gp130 is the founding member of a group of “tall” receptors that includes LIF-R, OSM-R, OB-R, G-CSF-R, and others (Fig. 1). These receptors have sequence homology to one another that places them as genetic relatives. They also share roughly similar domain architecture, particularly in the use of the top-mounted Ig-domain, the FNIII spacer domains, and the location of the cytokine binding regions (Fig. 3). However, these tall receptors may not all be shared. For instance, G-CSF is the only known ligand for G-CSFR, and leptin is the only known ligand for OB-R.

Despite the ubiquitous expression of gp130, cellular responsiveness mediated by gp130 cytokines is largely determined the half-lives of the locally secreted cytokines and by regulated expression of ligand specific chains. The biological importance of gp130 is clear from deletion studies in which the targeted disruption of gp130 gene in mice is lethal during embryogenesis. Collectively, gp130 signaling complexes mediate a wide variety and often overlapping biological functions, yet each member of the family yields a unique phenotype on inactivation. Deletion of LIF, for example, results in female infertility caused by failure of embryo implantation (Stewart *et al.*, 1992), while deletion of IL-6 results in impaired acute phase and anti-viral response (Kopf *et al.*, 1994; Poli *et al.*, 1994). We refer the reader to a number of excellent comprehensive reviews on the gp130 system (Bravo and Heath, 2000; Chow *et al.*, 2002; Grotzinger *et al.*, 1997, 1999; Heinrich *et al.*, 1998, 2003; Hirano *et al.*, 1997; Kishimoto *et al.*, 1995; Simpson *et al.*, 1997; Taga and Kishimoto 1997).

The family of gp130 cytokines can be subdivided into two main groups based on the identity of the signaling receptors incorporated into the final complex (Fig. 3). The first group of gp130 cytokines includes Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and Interleukin-11 (IL-11), both of which require association with a specific $\alpha$-receptor as the first step in the assembly pathway. Although dispensable for complex formation and signaling, the intracellular domain of IL-6R$\alpha$ appears to function in sorting of the $\alpha$ receptor to the

FIG. 3. The gp130 family of cytokines and receptors. Schematic representation of gp130 and leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR) oriented in a cell membrane. Of the four-helix bundle gp130 cytokines, structural information currently exists for human interleukin 6 (IL-6) (green) (Somers *et al.*, 1997), human herpes virus interleukin 6 (HHV-8 IL-6) (purple) (Chow *et al.*, 2001a), ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) (orange) (McDonald *et al.*, 1995), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) (blue) (Robinson *et al.*, 1994), and oncostatin-M (OSM) (red) (Deller *et al.*, 2000). Lower panel is a detailed list of gp130 cytokines and the associated receptors incorporated into the final signaling complex.

basolateral membrane of polarized cells (Martens *et al.*, 2000). A subgroup of this “homodimerization” class of gp130 cytokines is comprised of two viral homologues of IL-6, one from human herpes virus (HHV-8 IL-6) and the second from the Rhesus macaque rhadinovirus (Rm IL-6). These viral homologs short-circuit the traditional assembly pathway established for

IL-6 and IL-11 by dispensing with the requirement for an $\alpha$ receptor. A recent study suggests that “hydrophobic enhancement” of the receptor binding epitopes of HHV-8 IL-6 may be responsible for obviating the requirement for a specific $\alpha$ receptor (Boulanger *et al.*, 2004). The second group of gp130 cytokines mediate the heterodimerization of gp130 with a second signaling receptor known as LIF receptor (LIFR) (Benigni *et al.*, 1996; Hibi *et al.*, 1990; Taga and Kishimoto, 1997) (Fig. 3). This group represents the largest of the gp130 cytokines and includes leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), oncostatin (OSM), cardiotrophin (CT-1), ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), and NNT-1/BSF3, also known as cardiotrophin-like cytokine (CLC). The common theme between both groups is that the gp130 cytokines mediate the complexation of two signaling receptors. Interestingly, artificial homodimerization of the cytoplasmic domains of LIFR resulted in only weak signal activation highlighting the functional requirement of gp130 (Starr *et al.*, 1997).

The family of gp130 cytokines and receptors continues to grow with several recent additions (Trinchieri *et al.*, 2003). A third receptor, OSM receptor (OSM-R) (Mosley *et al.*, 1996) has also been identified as a potential signaling receptor for OSM. OSM-R is structurally similar to LIF-R but encodes only a partial N-terminal domain of the upper (N-terminal) CHR motif (Fig. 1). Functionally, Cosman and coworkers have shown that OSM is not capable of binding to either LIF-R or OSM-R except in the presence of gp130 (Mosley *et al.*, 1996). Using isothermal titration calorimetry of the soluble ectodomains, minus the three membrane proximal fibronectin repeats, of LIF-R, OSM-R, and gp130, we find that OSM can bind directly to LIF-R with nanomolar affinity in the absence of gp130 but shows no detectable binding to OSM-R even following precomplexation of OSM with gp130 (our unpublished data). Clearly, further studies are required to address these inconsistencies. Very recently a new gp130 cytokine, IL-27 (Trinchieri *et al.*, 2003), has been discovered that is secreted as a preformed complex consisting of the four-helix bundle cytokine p28 and an $\alpha$ receptor EB13. IL-27 appears to mediate the assembly of a fourth type of gp130 signaling complex, which consists of one gp130 receptor and a second signaling receptor known as TCCR or gp132 that is similar architecturally to gp130 but lacks the N-terminal Ig domain (Pflanz *et al.*, 2002; Sprecher *et al.*, 1998). For the sake of this review we will focus on the two primary groups of the higher order signaling complexes that incorporate gp130 and LIFR.

The three-dimensional structures are known for many gp130 cytokines including murine LIF (Robinson *et al.*, 1994), human LIF (Hinds *et al.*, 1998), CNTF (McDonald *et al.*, 1995), human Interleukin 6 (IL-6) (Somers *et al.*, 1997), HHV-8 IL-6 (Chow *et al.*, 2001a) and oncostatin M (OSM)
(Celler *et al.*, 2000) (Fig. 3). While each gp130 cytokine adopts the classical four-helix bundle motif, the lengths of the helices and interhelical loops differ with the loops even showing variation between homologs from different species (Bravo and Heath, 2000). The most interesting structural difference between the gp130 cytokines is observed in the topology of the A and D helices, which are straight in IL-6, IL-11 and HHV-8 IL-6 but exhibit a distinct kink in LIF, OSM and CNTF. The fact that these two structural features coincide with the receptor composition in the final signaling complexes—straight helical cytokines incorporate only gp130 as a signaling receptor while the kinked cytokines use both gp130 and an additional signaling receptor such as LIFR—has led to the suggestion that this structural feature plays an important role in molecular recognition (Bravo and Heath, 2000).

Architecturally, the ectodomains of gp130 and LIFR are composed of six and eight contiguous $\beta$-sandwich domains containing one or two signature CHR domains (Bazan, 1990a), respectively, and a single Ig-domain (IgD) (Hammacher *et al.*, 1998) (Fig. 3). Both gp130 and LIFR encode three membrane-proximal fibronectin type-III domains that do not play a specific role in cytokine recognition (Bravo *et al.*, 1998) but have recently been implicated in signal activation by correctly orienting and positioning the intracellular domains (Timmermann *et al.*, 2002). The non-signaling $\alpha$ receptors of IL-6, IL-11, CT-1, CNTF, and CLC are similar in structure to gp130 with an N-terminal Ig domain followed by a CHR domain yet differ in that they do not incorporate the three membrane proximal fibronectin repeats. Instead, the functional extracellular domains of these $\alpha$ receptors are linked to the membrane through amino acid stalks (IL-6, IL-11, CT-1) or GPI anchors (CNTF). The D1 or IgD domain of gp130 forms an essential component of the higher-order signaling complex with human IL-6, HHV-8, IL-6, and IL-11 (Boulanger *et al.*, 2003b; Chow *et al.*, 2001a) yet appears to be dispensable for assembly of the hetero complexes of gp130 with LIFR (Boulanger *et al.*, 2003a). The Ig domain is, however, thought to be involved in stabilizing the receptor during intracellular trafficking through the secretory pathway (Vollmer *et al.*, 1999). The “top mounted” Ig domain is a signature feature of the gp130 family that allows us to predict the architecture of all gp130-related signaling assemblies based on which receptor components in the complex carry this domain (discussed later).

In a similar fashion to the classical GH system, gp130 cytokines mediate the assembly of higher-order signaling complexes through distinct epitopes. The sites I and II, originally identified in GH, formed by distinct helical faces of the four-helix bundle are conserved in the gp130 cytokines. In addition, gp130 cytokines also include a third epitope, termed *site III*,that is formed by the tip of the four-helix bundle, formed by the C-D loops and the end of the D helix, and the N-terminus of the cytokine. Site I is used by IL-6, CNTF, IL-11, CT-1, and CLC to engage ligand-specific non-signaling $\alpha$ receptors. Site II is used by all gp130 cytokines to bind the CHR domain of gp130. Site III was originally identified as a functional epitope by mutagenesis and is responsible for driving the transition of the higher-order gp130 signaling complex through the interaction with the Ig domain of gp130 or LIFR (Hammacher *et al.*, 1998; Inoue *et al.*, 1995; Kallen *et al.*, 1999; Kurth *et al.*, 1999). Using a combination of these sites, and in some cases all three sites, the functional role of gp130 cytokines is to oligomerize the extracellular domains of the signaling receptors into a high-affinity complex, thereby promoting the association of the intracellular domains.

### Current Structural Knowledge

Despite significant structural information detailing the features of the unliganded gp130 cytokines, far less is known about the structures of the receptors alone or in complex with a ligand. The CHR domain of gp130 expressed in *E. coli* was solved in 1998 by Jones and co-workers (Bravo *et al.*, 1998). The 2.0 angstrom resolution structure of the gp130 CHR revealed a similar topology to other class I receptors of the hematopoietic cytokine receptor superfamily. The basic structural scaffold consists of two fibronectin, seven-stranded $\beta$ sandwich repeats that are related by a ~90-degree elbow angle connected by a proline-rich linker (Fig. 4). Mutagenesis studies have localized the cytokine binding interface on gp130 to the elbow region of the CHR domain at the interface between the N and C-terminal fibronectin domains. Structural information describing gp130 in complex with a cytokine, however, remained elusive for several more years in large part because of the technical difficulties of assembling the larger, hetero-oligomeric receptor complexes. We have now solved three different crystal structures of gp130/cytokine complexes (Boulanger *et al.*, 2003a,b; Chow *et al.*, 2001a).

The first complex structure of gp130 was obtained with HHV-8 IL-6 that mediates the homodimerization of two gp130 molecules (Chow *et al.*, 2001a) (Fig. 4). Oligomerization of gp130 by the HHV-8 IL-6 protein is independent of an $\alpha$ receptor and as a result, the site I of HHV-8 IL-6 is unoccupied. Biochemical studies showed that HHV-8 IL-6 did not form a stable complex with the gp130 CHR only, but addition of the gp130 Ig-domain resulted in the formation of a highly stable “tetramer” containing two copies each of cytokine and gp130. In tandem with the reconstitution of the viral tetramer, we also expressed human IL-6 and its $\alpha$ receptor

FIG. 4. Current structural knowledge of gp130 cytokine/receptor complexes. Four crystal structures are shown in the same relative orientations based on the gp130 CHR, as seen from a tilted side view (A) and a view onto the top of the complexes (B). CPK models are shown for the crystal structures of gp130 (D2-D3–CHR domain) (Bravo *et al.*, 1998), HHV-8 IL-6/gp130(D1-D3) (Chow *et al.*, 2001a), IL-6/IL-6Rα /gp130(D1-D3) (Boulanger *et al.*, 2003b) and LIF/gp130(D2-D3–CHR domain) (Boulanger *et al.*, 2003a). In transitioning from the HHV-8 IL-6/gp130 complex to the IL-6/IL-6Rα/ gp130 complex, the additional IL-6Rα docks onto the site I. CPK models were generated with MOLSCRIPT (Krulis, 1991) and RASTER3D (Merritt and Murphy, 1994).

along with the gp130 D1D2D3. This stable solution complex was shown to be a “hexamer” containing two copies of each component (Chow *et al.*, 2001b). Thus it was clear from biochemical studies that the major difference between the human and viral complexes was the presence of the α receptor in the human version. We crystallized and determined the structure of the viral complex (Chow *et al.*, 2001a). The complex assumes a tetrameric “hammock-like” configuration with two parallel gp130 molecules (D1-D3) bridged by two HHV-8 IL-6 cytokines (Fig. 4). The complex is tethered together through the interaction of one face of HHV-8 IL-6 (site II) with a gp130 CHR (D2D3) and a second epitope (site III) at the tip of the HHV-8 IL-6 four-helix bundle interacting with the IGD (D1) domain of a different gp130 from the other half of the tetramer. The cytokine, then, uses spatially distinct epitopes to enforce dimerization on gp130 in an antiparallel orientation. The veracity of the viral complex to the mammalian cytokines was clear to us, especially seeing that a conserved aromatic residue (Trp<sup>144</sup>) in HHV-8 IL-6 forms the major site III

interface contact. In human IL-6, a Trp<sup>157</sup> superimposes in the identical location as found on the viral cytokine. This structure provided the first accurate view of the site III epitope that appears to be unique to gp130 cytokines, which rationalized functional and mutagenesis data highlighting the importance of the D1 domain of gp130 in formation of the higher order signaling complex.

The HHV-8 IL-6/gp130 crystal structure also helps to resolve structural inconsistencies of a putative site III epitope observed in complex of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) with its receptor G-CSFR. G-CSFR is the most closely related receptor to gp130 with better than 45% homology and the same extracellular domain structure. Functionally, G-CSFR differs from gp130 in that it is not a shared receptor but instead is specific for G-CSF. The crystal structure of G-CSF in complex with G-CSFR was solved by Morikawa and coworkers ([Aritomi *et al.*, 1999](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.274.31.21879)) and showed the conserved site II interaction between G-CSF and G-CSFR consistent with previous mutagenesis data ([Layton *et al.*, 1999](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.274.20.14158)). No non-signaling α receptor is required, and thus the site I is unoccupied. The G-CSF receptor does, however, possess an Ig domain that is known to be required for signaling, suggesting the possibility of a functional site III on G-CSF ([Layton *et al.*, 2001](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M009695200)). In the crystal structure of the G-CSF/G-CSFR CHR complex, there is a “side-by-side” dimer of 1:1 complexes to form an overall 2:2, which is the predicted stoichiometry of the active extracellular signaling complex for G-CSF with the G-CSFR. Although this dimer of CHR complexes lacks the D1, a case was made for this assembly representing the active signaling complex even though it was topologically unlikely that a D1 domain could fold back and make further interactions with the complex ([Aritomi *et al.*, 1999](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.274.31.21879)). The putative site III epitope suggested by this model was at odds with the HHV-8 IL-6/gp130 structure; however, epitope-mapping studies of G-CSF binding to G-CSFR defined an interaction between a “site III” epitope of GCSF with the D1 domain of G-CSFR, resulting in a model identical in topology to the HHV-8 IL-6/gp130 framework ([Chow *et al.*, 2001a](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M009695200); [Layton *et al.*, 2001](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M009695200)).

More recently we have determined the crystal structure of the IL-6/gp130/IL-6Rα hexamer, which provides the first comprehensive view of a hematopoietic cytokine that incorporates all three binding epitopes—site I, II, and III—into the final assembled complex ([Fig. 4](#fig4)). The core of the hexamer (gp130 D1D2D3 and IL-6) is reminiscent of the HHV-8 IL-6 tetramer complex, where two IL-6 cytokines bridge two gp130 molecules forming a tetramer. However, the addition of the IL-6Rα, not required for HHV-8 IL-6 signaling ([Mullberg *et al.*, 2000](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M009695200); [Osborne *et al.*, 1999](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M009695200)), results in a much more complicated network of interfaces than seen in the viral complex. Rather than simply “decorating” the exposed site I of the

human cytokine, IL-6Rα forms a series of complex composite binding interfaces with gp130. Overall, the hexamer is held together by 10 two-fold-related protein–protein interfaces, five of which are unique to each half of the hexamer (i.e., a dimer of five interfaces: sites I, sites IIa and b, sites IIIa and b), that results in a total buried surface area of nearly 5500 Å² (Fig. 4).

In the IL-6 hexamer, the site I binding epitope of IL-6 is localized to the A and D helices and interacts with IL-6Rα to form the initial IL-6/IL-6Rα binary complex. The D3 domain of IL-6Rα provides the majority of contact surface with IL-6, contributing more than 70% of the total buried surface area. The remaining four unique (or eight 2-fold related) protein-protein interfaces exist as composite epitopes (Fig. 4). The composite site II interaction of the IL-6/IL-6Rα complex with gp130 is separated into two spatially distinct interfaces: site IIa is between the IL-6 A and C helical faces and the “elbow” region at the boundary between the D2 and D3 domains of gp130 CHR, and site IIb is between the IL-6Rα D3 domain and the gp130 D3 domain. In site IIb there is overall shape complementarity with the D3 domain of IL-6Rα presenting a convex bulge that docks into an extended cavity on the D3 domain of gp130. The composite site III epitope that is unique to gp130 cytokines is formed by Site IIIa, which is a broad and discontinuous interface between IL-6 and gp130, where the tip of the IL-6 four-helical bundle (A/B loop and N-terminal region of D helix) abuts into the bottom β-sheet of the D1 domain of gp130. Site IIIb is formed by the interface between N-terminal portion of the D1 domain of gp130 and the D2 domain of IL-6Rα. The unexpected “composite epitopes” revealed the basis for the required pre-complexation between IL-6 and IL-6Rα. The additional surfaces provided by the sites IIb and IIIb interface enhances the overall binding affinity. Since neither IL-6 nor IL-6Rα have measurable affinity for gp130 alone, the composite interfaces appear to act as a molecular brace to hold IL-6 against the gp130 CHR and D1 binding site of two distinct gp130 receptors.

### B. A New Cytokine Receptor Recognition Module: The Logic of Site III

The growth hormone structure established the architecture of the site I and II interactions in a homodimeric receptor complex. The viral and human IL-6 complexes with gp130 extend this paradigm to heterodimeric complexes but also elaborate the modular epitope concept by adding the site III. It is clear from the gp130 complexes that in the case of the HHV-8 IL-6, a site II is used for the gp130 CHR contact. In the human structure, a site I is used for the α receptor and a site II is used for the gp130 CHR interaction. Similar to GH, in the human IL-6 structure, precomplexation
to site I is required for subsequent engagement of site II. The structural basis for this is extensive receptor-receptor contact, as is also seen in the GH homodimer, and is the basis for the sequential binding model where site I is first engaged followed by the second GH receptor to site II. One may ask, then, why site III? In GH, each receptor polypeptide contains the full complement of adaptor motifs to engage JAK/STAT components. In the gp130 system, the $\alpha$ receptors do not contain intracellular signaling domains, which are only present on gp130. Thus the trimolecular complexes of $\alpha$ receptor/cytokine/gp130 need a mechanism to themselves dimerize to bring together the signaling components of gp130. The protruding tip of the cytokine, as it sits sandwiched on both flanks (or one for the HHV-8 IL-6), presents a convenient interaction point to complex with the protruding Ig-domain of gp130 to then “double” the complexes (Figs. 4 and 5), thereby initiating signaling. Therefore the logic of a site III results from the fact that gp130, as a shared receptor, forms heterodimers with non-signaling $\alpha$ receptors. An additional binding epitope is required to bring two competent intracellular signaling motifs into proximity.

### C. LIF Complex with the CHR of gp130

To date there is no structural information describing LIFR by itself or in complex with a gp130 cytokine. However, we have recently determined the crystal structure of the binary complex of gp130 with LIF ([Boulanger *et al.*, 2003a](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M302945200)), where LIF is the representative member of the second group of gp130 cytokines that incorporate LIFR into the final signaling complex (Fig. 4). The assumption in the literature was that LIF required precomplexation with LIFR prior to binding gp130. However, we expressed soluble forms of the gp130 CHR, the gp130 DID2D3 domains, and the top five domains of LIFR and tested them for interaction with LIF. We found that LIF is capable of forming complexes with both gp130 and LIF independent of one another: there was no requirement for precomplexation (discussed later). In fact, LIF formed a moderate affinity complex with both the gp130 CHR and the three domain gp130 CHR+IgD, indicating that the top mounted Ig domain of gp130 was not playing a role in the LIF signaling complex. This result provided a strong clue that the Ig domain of gp130 was not acting as an activation module in gp130/LIFR heterocomplexes. We crystallized and determined the structure of LIF complexed with the gp130 CHR. The interaction between LIF and the CHR domain of gp130 differs somewhat from that observed for HIV-8 IL-6 and human IL-6. Overall, LIF interacts primarily with the D2 domain of gp130 (Fig. 4) rather than within the “elbow” formed by the D2D3 bend,

Residues contributing to the buried surface area of the interface, as calculated using the Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) server [http://www.biochem.ucl.ac.uk/bsm/PP/server]. Hydrophobic residues are colored as green surface and hydrophilic residues as red surface. Note the core hydrophobic region surrounded by discontinuous patches of polar residues. The A and C helices (blue) and the associated contact residues for each of the three cytokines are shown docked onto the surface of gp130. Lower panel: Surface representations showing the hydrophobic properties of the site II gp130 CHR binding epitope of HHV-8 IL-6, IL-6, and LIF. Note the significant hydrophilic contact surface of LIF relative to the primarily hydrophobic contact surface of HHV-8 IL6. (B) The packing of the conserved gp130 residue Phe<sup>169</sup> (green) into surface pockets on HHV-8 IL-6, IL-6 and LIF. The binding affinity of the complexes appear to be consistent with the polarity of the Phe<sup>169</sup> binding pocket (i.e., the more hydrophobic the pocket the higher the associated binding affinity) (HHV8 IL-6 > IL-6 > LIF). VMD ([Humphrey et al., 1996]) was used to prepare MSMS surface representations ([Sanner et al., 1996]).

which was the binding strategy observed both in the HHV-8 IL-6/gp130 structure ([Chow et al., 2001a]) and the human IL-6 hexameric complex structure ([Boulanger et al., 2003b]). Site II of LIF is positioned towards the extreme N-terminal end of the four-helix bundle where the site II of HHV-8 IL-6 and IL-6 are more centrally located. The translational shift of the

gp130 binding epitope along the long helical axis of LIF is likely due to an N-terminal “flap” preceding helix A that is unique among gp130 cytokines to LIF. Structurally this flap is tethered at both ends by disulfide bonds (Cys<sup>12</sup>–Cys<sup>134</sup> and Cys<sup>18</sup>–Cys<sup>131</sup>) and forms a protruding lip at the base of the four helix bundle. The flap effectively buttresses gp130 on one side, rigidifying the complex and also creates an obvious shape complementarity in the interface through formation of a concave pocket that packs snugly against the convex CD loop of gp130CHR.

VI. A STRUCTURAL BASIS OF GP130 CROSS-REACTIVITY: SITE II

The basis for the extreme cross-reactivity that permits gp130 to bind with more than 10 known ligands is a fundamental question in gp130 signaling. The site II epitope is used by all gp130 cytokines to engage the CHR domain of gp130. We analyzed the protein-protein interfaces of gp130 in complex with human IL-6 ([Boulanger *et al.*, 2003b](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M305936200)), HHV-8 IL-6 ([Chow *et al.*, 2001a](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M101468200)), and LIF ([Boulanger *et al.*, 2003a](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M305936200)) (Fig. 5A). Each of the three cytokines use entirely different site II residues to contact gp130. A structural comparison of the contact surfaces on the CHR of gp130 in complex with HHV-8 IL-6, LIF, and IL-6 revealed a core shared region that dominated ligand binding (Fig. 5A). Surrounding this region are discontinuous patches that show ligand specificity and which we have termed “specificity islands.” By characterizing the chemical nature of the residues that contribute to binding, we found that the core shared region is largely hydrophobic while the residues that comprise the specificity islands are largely polar. Despite the clear parsing of polar and apolar residues into distinct regions, gp130 contributes an approximately equal mix of polar and apolar residues to the binding interface likely necessary for the chemically diverse ligand surfaces with which it interacts. The site II residues of HHV-8 IL-6 are strikingly hydrophobic with two bulky tryptophan residues (Trp<sup>18</sup> and Trp<sup>21</sup>) contributing 30% of the total buried surface area in complex with gp130, and forms a broad hydrophobic patch on helix A (Fig. 5A). The site II epitope of hIL-6 is significantly more polar with a single, centrally disposed tyrosine (Tyr<sup>31</sup>), which from mutational studies is known to play an important role in receptor binding ([Savino *et al.*, 1994](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.269.27.18055)). The contact surface of LIF is the most polar consistent, with four well-defined solvent atoms that participate in an inter-molecular hydrogen bond network observed in the crystal structure of LIF in complex with gp130 ([Boulanger *et al.*, 2003a](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M305936200)). A noteworthy observation was that the binding surface on gp130 is extremely rigid between the unliganded and liganded forms, showing almost no rotameric flexibility in the side-chains ([Boulanger *et al.*, 2003a](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M305936200)). Together, these observations suggest
that the extreme cross-reactivity of gp130 relies on the chemical and thermodynamic properties of the different cytokine epitopes rather than the more commonly observed structural plasticity (Atwell *et al.*, 1997; Sundberg and Mariuzza, 2000).

Extensive structure function studies have identified Phe<sup>169</sup>, which is centrally disposed on the gp130 CHR interface as critical for ligand engagement for all human gp130-cytokines (Fig. 5) (Bravo *et al.*, 1998; Horsten *et al.*, 1997; Kurth *et al.*, 1999; Li and Nicholas, 2002). The use of a bulky hydrophobic solvent exposed residue at site II is also observed in the GH/GHR complex (de Vos *et al.*, 1992) and the EPO/EPOR complex (Syed *et al.*, 1998) suggesting a more fundamental role in mediating protein-protein interactions. In these cases, a bulky tyrosine docks into a hydrophobic pocket on the cytokine formed by the Ca backbone of helix C. Phe<sup>169</sup> contributes the largest fraction of buried surface area in the LIF-gp130 interface (113 Å<sup>2</sup>) the HHV-8 IL-6-gp130 interface (127 Å<sup>2</sup>) (Chow *et al.*, 2001a), as well as the human IL-6 hexamer site II (128 Å<sup>2</sup>) (Boulanger *et al.*, 2003b). In each case, Phe<sup>169</sup> docks into a pocket formed on the site II epitope of the cytokine, although the topology and hydrophobic nature of the pocket varies greatly between cytokine (Fig. 5B). The surface of HIV-8 IL-6 represents one extreme with a deep pocket formed by Trp<sup>18</sup> on one side and Leu<sup>11</sup> on the other. The depth of the pocket is dictated largely by the protruding side-chain of Trp<sup>18</sup>, which packs orthogonally against the side-chain of Phe<sup>169</sup>. Two large polar residues, Glu<sup>14</sup> and Arg<sup>15</sup>, are positioned in the middle of the pocket but are flattened out so that their polar head groups are directed toward solvent and the hydrophobic methylene part of the side-chains form the primary contact with Phe<sup>169</sup>. The surface pockets on human IL-6 and LIF that accommodate Phe<sup>169</sup> are more similar in overall topology and are not as deep as observed for HHV-8 IL-6. On human IL-6, Phe<sup>169</sup> of gp130 does not really sit in a pocket on the cytokine but instead packs directly against the splayed out methylene side-chain of Lys<sup>27</sup>. Forming the backside of the binding region on human IL-6 are Arg<sup>24</sup> and Gln<sup>28</sup>, with the polar head group of Gln<sup>28</sup> packing against the Cβ atom of Phe<sup>169</sup>. The gp130 binding surface on LIF is the most polar of all three cytokines. The polar head groups of Gln<sup>32</sup> and Gln<sup>25</sup> form the walls of the pocket and direct the aromatic ring of Phe<sup>169</sup> to pack against the Cβ atom of Ser<sup>28</sup> in a similar fashion to the packing of Phe<sup>169</sup> against Lys<sup>27</sup> on human IL-6.

The binding affinity of the cytokine ligand for gp130 then appears to be commensurate with the polarity of the Phe<sup>169</sup> docking site on the cytokine. From this observation, we suggest that the shared region on gp130, anchored by Phe<sup>169</sup>, forms the primary molecular determinant for complex formation, while the surrounding residues utilize an extremechemical flexibility, involving both main-chain and side-chain, to form interactions appropriate to the surface chemistry of each of the ten cytokines which bind gp130.

# VII. THERMODYNAMIC BASIS FOR A UNIVERSAL BINDING SOLUTION

Given the relative rigidity observed in the gp130 CHR binding surface, it is apparent that structural adaptation is not used as a means of cross-reactivity but suggests that the basis of gp130 cross-reactivity lies in the unique chemistry of the CHR epitope. To test this we used isothermal titration calorimetry to measure the energetics of the interaction between the CHR domain of gp130 and individually LIF, OSM, CNTF, and human IL-6 (Table I). In all cases, the interactions are primarily entropy-driven desolvation processes (LIF: 5 cal/[molK]; human IL-6: 45 cal/[molK]; OSM: 30 cal/[molK]; and CNTF: 62 cal/[molK]), albeit to varying extents commensurate with the surface polarity of the cytokine in the site II. For instance, the highly polar LIF showed the least desolvation and largest enthalpy. The ITC measurements, then, vividly reveal the underlying basis of cross-reactivity, which was suggested by crystal structures. We interpret these data to mean that gp130 is utilizing desolvation as a structurally insensitive means of cross-reacting with structurally unique surfaces. We suggest that as a cross-reactive receptor, gp130 has an extraordinary ability to order water at its CHR binding site. The multiple solvent exposed aromatic residues are likely covered with immobilized water clathrates in

Note that each titration shows favorable entropy (ΔS), albeit to varying degrees.the unbound state, setting up a situation in which expulsion of the water into bulk solvent would be extremely entropically favorable. The subsequent formation of protein–protein contacts, either polar or apolar, provide an additional driving force for complex formation with cytokines whose surface structure and chemistry may not be ideal. The necessity for gp130 to complex with multiple ligands means that gp130 must achieve a balance between elimination of unfavorable interactions that would prevent certain cytokines from binding but preservation of favorable interactions with each ligand. However, the favorable interactions may have limitations, since the formation of energetically ideal interactions with one cytokine may result in disfavoring interactions with another cytokine. Specificity is likely not achieved without a loss of cross-reactivity. When the affinities of the gp130 CHR for cytokines are examined, they are in the high nanomolar range. Such “moderate” affinities probably represent a ceiling in which too high affinity for a cytokine would result in a loss of cross-reactivity for others. In fact, the true energetic basis of gp130 cross-reactivity may be very subtle. Recently a shotgun alanine scan of a high-affinity GH variant revealed the basis for the affinity enhancement was the elimination of negative bystander residues in the phage selection and not necessarily the introduction of more favorable interactions (Sidhu *et al.*, 2000). Certainly natural evolution has probably utilized such a mechanism on the gp130 CHR to clear the binding site of residues not favorable for cross-reactivity and create a fairly inoffensive, generic binding site. Overall, there appears to be divergent structural solutions for gp130 recognition of cytokine but a convergence in the overall thermodynamic properties underlying the recognition.

One might ask if the energetic and structural mechanism by which gp130 cross-reacts could also be used by other shared receptors such as the $\gamma_{c}$ and $\beta_{c}$. The structural analogies are very clear. The $\gamma_{c}$ extracellular domain is a two-domain CHR module similar to the site II CHR module of gp130. Thus $\gamma_{c}$ clearly recognizes a range of diverse cytokines using the same “elbow” bend in the CHR carrying the amino acid contacts on the loops connecting the $\beta$-sheets of the individual FNIII-style domains. Mutagenesis studies have implicated Tyr${}^{103}$ of $\gamma_{c}$ as being a major contact point for essentially most $\gamma_{c}$ class cytokines. This Tyr${}^{103}$ appears to be analogous to the Phe${}^{169}$ of gp130. Hence, $\gamma_{c}$ may utilize Tyr${}^{103}$ as an anchor point that is surrounded by either chemically amphipathic or structurally flexible peripheral contacts as a means of cross-reactivity. One major difference between $\gamma_{c}$ and gp130 is the presence of a linker region between the two CHR domains in $\gamma_{c}$. Some residues in this region have been shown to affect cytokine recognition. The gp130 CHR does not have such a linker, instead showing a close abutment between the two CHR domains and
essentially no interdomain flexibility. Based on the presence of this linker, we suggest that the $\gamma_{c}$ receptor probably has a significant degree of interdomain flexibility and also is likely quite structurally plastic in its binding site, as has been seen in the GH receptor, for instance, as a means of accommodating mutations in GH (Atwell *et al.*, 1997). Therefore $\gamma_{c}$ appears more likely to utilize structural flexibility as a means of cytokine cross-reactivity than gp130. Direct structural information will be required to answer these questions.

The basis of the cross-reactivity by $\beta_{c}$ is a more difficult question for many of the reasons discussed earlier when reviewing the structure of the entire ectodomain. At the present time we are not exactly sure which regions of the $\beta_{c}$ dimer are the cytokine interaction module. However, the recent mutagenesis study by Murphy *et al.* (2003) seems to indicate that the CHR is formed by the convergence of the two receptors to form a CHR-like module with protruding loops similar to that used in the site II interaction by gp130. A further refinement of this finding, as well as a more precise definition of the cytokine structural epitope, is needed before making any structural or energetic predictions regarding cross-reactivity.

VIII. CROSS-REACTIVITY OF THE GP130 IGD WITH CYTOKINE SITE III

While the gp130 CHR is clearly the “gateway” entry point for all gp130-cytokines, and is the focal point of this shared receptors cross-reactivity, the top-mounted Ig domain also interacts with the IL-6, IL-11 and HHV-8 IL-6 site III surfaces. At this point we only have two structures with intact site III/gp130 interfaces to examine (Boulanger *et al.*, 2003b; Chow *et al.*, 2001a), but some obvious features emerge (Fig. 6). The site III binding patch on the gp130 IGD contains both degenerate and specific structural features relevant to its function as a shared signal-transducer (Fig. 6). In both the human and viral complexes, the site III interaction is comprised of an extensive interface between the tips of the cytokine four-helix bundle (A/B loop and start of D-helix) and the edge (GF strands) of the upper 3-stranded $\beta$-sheet of the gp130 IGD (D1) (Fig. 6) (Boulanger *et al.*, 2003b; Chow *et al.*, 2001a). The IGD is a rigid structural framework that does not appear to utilize conformational plasticity to cross-react with multiple different cytokine site III surfaces. Rather, the site III interaction surface of the cytokine is composed primarily of flexible inter-helical loops and appears to adapt its structure to the surface of the IGD in an induced-fit type of interaction (Fig. 6, top). One very curious feature of the site III interface in both human and viral complexes is the four N-terminal peptide residues of gp130 insert into a groove between the C helix and

The Ig domain of gp130 (blue) from the human and viral receptor complexes is shown in isolation with the respective cytokines (purple) at the site III interfaces. At the top is a “top view” of a transparent molecular surface with the ribbons of the structure within. In this view the convex tip of the cytokine is abutting into the bottom sheet of the gp130 Ig-domain. The penetrating N-terminal peptide from gp130 is also seen to insert into a groove on the cytokine surface. At the bottom of the figure, the view is directly into the cytokine binding sheet of the gp130 Ig-domain with the interacting loops of the cytokines shown as sticks, so that we are looking through the cytokine into the receptor. The centrally-disposed Trp residue at the heart of both site III interfaces is indicated in both views. Figure generated with PyMol (W. Delano).

A/B loop of the cytokine, forming a sheet-like structure with the A/B loop (Fig. 6, top). In both the viral and human IL-6 site II complexes, the A/B loop is ordered, whereas this loop I disordered in most unliganded cytokines. In both the viral IL-6 and human IL-6 site II interfaces, a Trp residue (Trp<sup>144</sup> and Trp<sup>157</sup> respectively) forms the heart of the interfaces, burying more surface than any other residues (Fig. 6, Fig. 7A). The placement of this aromatic residue is a conserved feature of all gp130-cytokines and so likely represents the site III hotspot. This central Trp is surrounded by a chemically diverse array of amino acids to make up a very large interaction surface with the gp130 D1 domain. In fact, many of the contacts are main chain Van der Waals and hydrogen bonds with the

cytokine A/B loop, which suggests a relative lack of discrimination as to the amino acid content of the protein surface surrounding the Trp (Fig. 6). On the D1 side, the contact surface is a depression in a β-sheet of the Ig domain, which receives the bulky Trp residues (Fig. 6, bottom). The G β-strand, where the IGD receives the conserved aromatic (Trp<sup>144</sup> in HHV-8 IL6, Trp<sup>157</sup> in human IL-6) present on all gp130-cytokines only exposes main chain atoms and a glycine (Gly<sup>95</sup>) to the cytokine, reducing the possibility of side-chain-specific interactions that would diminish

cross-reactivity. The site III binding face of the Ig domain is distinctly lacking in prominent charge or structural features, with no large protruding side chains, perhaps, then, tuned to “absorb” a range of complementary surfaces on the cytokine. In fact, one might describe the site III interface as the reverse of the site II interface in that the protruding aromatic is provided by the cytokine in the site III, but provided by the receptor in site II, with both jutting into rather vanilla depressions on the opposing surface. Similar to site II, the D1 binding site uses amphipathicity to broaden the range of ligand surface chemistries with which it can interact, with an abundance of residues such as Tyr and Asn participating in both polar and non-polar interactions. Overall, we would suggest that, similar to the site II Phe<sup>169</sup> situation, the site III interface is focused on the burial of the aromatic from the cytokine, with surrounding complementarity provided by a degree of chemical amphipathicity. Thus, as long as the site III contains the conserved aromatic, the surrounding interactions appear relatively devoid of highly specific interactions.

LIF receptor also uses its Ig domain (D3) to receive site III epitopes of CNTF, LIF, CT-1, OSM, and others. So the Ig domain of LIF receptor is, in fact, more cross-reactive than gp130. The site III structures of all gp130-cytokines maintain a conserved aromatic residue at the tip of the D helix (Fig. 7) that is certainly the structural analog to the Trp residues we see in the center of the gp130 site III interface. Therefore we predict that the LIFR site III interface cross-reactivity is achieved by using similar structural features at the gp130 IgD.

IX. PREDICTING THE HIGHER-ORDER ASSEMBLIES OF THE ASYMMETRIC COMPLEXES (GP130/LIFR)

The architecture of the signaling assembly provided by the viral and human IL-6 complexes with gp130 allows us to predict the structure of all other gp130-cytokine complexes. The key information necessary for this prediction is to know which receptor carries the “active” CHR and which carries the top-mounted Ig domain used in the site II interaction ([Grotzinger *et al.*, 1999; Kallen *et al.*, 1999]). A prescient example is the LIF/LIFR/gp130 complex. One of the key questions regarding the cytokines, which use both gp130 and LIFR, is how they manage to break the symmetry of the core tetramer template we see in the IL-6 complexes. The gp130/LIFR cytokines use two different receptors, so they cannot assemble a symmetric complex. In the absence of structural information on the complete LIF/gp130/LIFR complex, biophysical ([Boulanger *et al.*, 2003a]), mutagenesis, and functional studies ([Plun-Favreau *et al.*, 2003]) have been used to probe the higher order assembly ([Aasland *et al.*, 2002, 2003]).
Multi-angle light scattering (MALS) of the LIF/gp130/LIFR complex showed the molecular mass to be 118 kDa, consistent with a heterotrimeric assembly including one copy each of LIF, gp130, and LIFR ([Boulanger *et al.*, 2003a]). Furthermore, pre-complexation of LIF with either gp130 or LIFR does not influence binding to the other receptor, indicating that in the final complex the five N-terminal domains of LIFR and the three N-terminal domains of gp130 do not interact.

With the overall heterotrimeric stoichiometry of the LIF signaling complex established, the next step was to characterize the binding epitope on LIFR. From the crystal structures of viral and human IL-6, which mediate the homodimerization of two gp130 receptors, a centrally disposed tryptophan at the tip of the four-helix bundle (site III) abuts into the D1 or Ig domain of gp130 ([Fig. 6]). A sequence comparison of LIF, OSM and CT-1—all of which incorporate one copy of gp130 and one copy of LIFR into the final signaling complex—highlight a conserved phenylalanine and lysine that form part of the FXXK motif ([Fig. 7A]), as also noted previously ([Deller *et al.*, 2000]). Crystal structures of LIF and OSM show that this conserved motif is located at the tip of the four-helix bundle forming the site III binding epitope ([Deller *et al.*, 2000]). Although no structure exists for LIFR, recent modeling and docking studies of the Ig domain of LIFR, which is located at the D3 position, with LIF revealed that the conserved Phe/Lys pair on LIF ([Fig. 7A]) are complemented by a Phe/Asp pair on LIFR ([Plun-Favreau *et al.*, 2003]). Mutagenesis of these residues to alanines, while not adversely affecting the expression or topology of LIFR, severely impaired LIF-dependent activation in cell assays ([Plun-Favreau *et al.*, 2003]), consistent with the Ig domain of LIFR being the docking site for the site III of LIF. Furthermore, Baca and coworkers, using a phage display selection process, showed that increasing the hydrophobicity of residues proximal to the Phe/Lys pair on the site III of LIF dramatically increased the binding affinity between LIF and LIFR ([Fairlie *et al.*, 2003]). Based on these observations, we have generated a theoretical model of the LIF/gp130/LIFR complex in which the site II of LIF engages the gp130 CHR domain as observed in the crystal structure ([Boulanger *et al.*, 2003a]) and the site III of LIF engages the D3 or Ig domain of LIFR ([Fig. 7B]). The topology of the LIF/gp130/LIFR is likely conserved in the gp130 heterodimeric complexes that include LIFR and represents a blueprint distinct from the “core tetramer” motif used in the homodimeric gp130 signaling complexes. The key feature of this heterotrimeric complex is that the interaction of the LIF site III with the LIFR Ig domain is very high affinity and therefore does not require a site II interaction to enhance the overall affinity, as seen in the gp130 situation. Thus LIFR is stable simply “hanging” off the end of LIF without any other support. The gp130 site III
interaction is too weak to remain bound to site III unless an opposing site II was constraining it to be in that orientation. The conclusion, then, is that the symmetry of the homodimer template is broken through a high-affinity site III, negating its own site II interaction. This model predicts that neither CHR of LIF is, in fact, a bona fide cytokine binding module and that the only functional cytokine binding site on LIFR is the Ig domain located at the D3 position. The functional data regarding the activity of these CHRs is not clear (Aasland *et al.*, 2003).

This logic can be extended to some of the new gp130-class cytokines recently identified. For instance, TCCR (or WSX-1, or gp130b) is a signaling receptor used in tandem with gp130 by IL-27 (Pflanz *et al.*, 2002; Sprecher *et al.*, 1998). TCCR does not have a top Ig domain but does have a CHR module at D1D2. This tells us that IL-27 uses the CHR of TCCR but then must have a very high affinity for the Ig domain of gp130. The structure of the IL-27 complex with TCCR and gp130 would resemble the LIF/LIFR/gp130 complex where TCCR would replace gp130, and gp130 would replace LIFR.

X. TRANSLATING LIGAND RECOGNITION INTO SIGNALING

The solution of this problem remains the holy grail for any receptor system. How is ligand recognition coupled to the activation of intracellular signaling? For gp130, we have seen that the obvious initiating event occurs distal to the cell surface. The complicated architecture of the top three domains of gp130 complexed with cytokine positions of the intracellular domains in a precise geometry required for signaling. One might say the hexamer and tetramer ligand-receptor complexes form a “cap.” However, we do not have any structural information for the three FNIII domains, which we refer to as “legs,” leading from the ligand binding CHR and Ig domains to the membrane (Fig. 8). A very important question then is what the relationship is between the cap and the legs. Examination of our structures reveals that the D3 domains of gp130, as they lead downward, actually project away from each other. If the FNIII domains continued along this direction in a straight path, by the time they reached the cell surface each gp130 would enter the membrane hundreds of angstroms away from each other (Fig. 8). If the role of gp130 dimerization is to bring the intracellular segments into close relative proximity, it is hard to imagine how the intracellular domains could communicate over such a long distance. Our ITC data on the six-domain gp130 complex indicates that there is likely an interaction between the legs of gp130 in the full-length complex (Boulanger *et al.*, 2003b). The indicator is that the six-domain gp130 extracellular domain has an overall less favorable free

FIG. 8. Possible orientations of the ‘legs’ of gp130. The CPK model of the IL-6/IL-6Rα/gp130 hexamer structure ([Boulanger *et al.*, 2003b](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M305965200)) is drawn along with schematic model of the three membrane proximal fibronectin repeats that connect the cap to the membrane. The two models to the right incorporate data suggesting an interaction between the gp130 legs ([Boulanger *et al.*, 2003b](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M305965200)), possibly the D5 domain ([Kurth *et al.*, 2000](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M003544200)). To date, no structural information exists describing the position and orientation of the three membrane proximal domains.

energy for hexamer formation with IL-6 than the three-domain soluble gp130-ligand complex. We interpret this to mean that the six-domain gp130 is in some steric strain, preventing a collapse into the lower free energy state of the three-domain version. Since the difference in the two complexes is the presence of the extra three FNIII domains, we suggest that these “legs” are in contact with one another and that this contact prevents the top-mounted complex from relaxing into the lowest energy state. In fact this further suggests that a role of complex formation is to drive the legs together. These thermodynamic data are supported by cellular studies showing that the D5 domain of gp130 form a cross-link in the final signaling complex (Kurth *et al.*, 2000). Collectively, these data suggest two surprising features. One is that the gp130 extracellular domain must be “bent” at an angle as it exits the D3 domain at the base of the cap (Fig. 8). The only way that the legs could be in contact is if the receptor breaks off at an almost 90-degree angle at the base of the D3 domains and projects back towards the other half of the dimer. The second implication is that the six-domain gp130 ectodomain is a rigid structure that utilizes this rigidity as a means of compressing the legs together and maintain a close proximity of the receptors as they enter the cell membrane. The disposition of the gp130 FNIII spacer domains is an important future question of this family.
