# Mechanisms of Disease: the complement system and the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus

H Terence Cook* and Marina Botto

## SUMMARY

Complement activation is common in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), resulting in hypocomplementemia and deposition of complement at sites of tissue damage. The availability of mice with specific deficiencies of components of the complement system has provided new insights into the mechanisms by which complement might be involved in autoimmunity and tissue injury in SLE. In humans, deficiencies of early components of the classical complement pathway are strongly associated with SLE. Mice lacking Clq or C4 are also predisposed to autoimmunity, which is associated with the failure of normal clearance of apoptotic cells bearing on their surfaces many of the autoantigens involved in SLE. Antiphospholipid syndrome is common in patients with SLE and studies in an animal model of fetal loss caused by antiphospholipid syndrome have shown that injury is dependent on activation of complement with subsequent neutrophil influx and synthesis of tumor necrosis factor. Insights from animal models might enable the design of more rational therapeutic approaches for manipulating the complement system in human SLE.

## INTRODUCTION

Activation of the complement cascade is common in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), leading to hypocomplementemia and deposition of complement components at sites of tissue injury, particularly in the renal glomeruli and in the skin. This finding suggests that complement activation is likely to have a role in tissue damage in SLE. Studies have also shown that complement is important in the generation of the autoimmune response in SLE, but in this setting, paradoxically, complement seems to have a protective role as shown by the high incidence of SLE in individuals genetically deficient in early components of the classical pathway of complement activation. In this review, we will discuss the mechanisms by which the complement system influences autoimmunity and tissue injury in SLE, with particular reference to recent insights gained from studies in mouse models.

## THE COMPLEMENT SYSTEM

The complement system consists of more than 30 plasma and cell-surface proteins that provide a rapid response to bacterial infections, link the innate and adaptive immune responses, and allow the disposal of immune complexes and other products of injury.¹ The main components of the system are shown in Figure 1. Over the past decade, genetic manipulation has been used to produce mice that lack individual proteins of the complement system, and inhibitors of various stages of complement activation have been developed that can be used *in vivo*. These approaches have led to a better understanding of the roles of the complement system in the generation of the autoimmune response in SLE and in causing tissue injury. We will consider these two areas in turn.

Terminal pathway

Figure 1 A simplified overview of the complement system. There are three distinct pathways of complement activation, all of which converge on the complement component C3 that is cleaved to generate C3a and C3b. C3b can act to opsonize material for ingestion by phagocytic cells and to enhance clearance of immune complexes. C3b can also form part of C5 convertase, which cleaves C5 to generate the chemotactic fragment C5a. This cleavage results in assembly of the membrane attack complex (C5b–9), which can insert into cell membranes and cause lysis of bacteria and damage to nucleated cells. The classical pathway is activated following binding of IgM or complement-fixing isotypes of IgG on cell surfaces or in immune complexes. The first complement component, C1, binds to the antibody via its component C1q, and this binding initiates a cascade of protein cleavage that proceeds via C4 and C2. C1q can also be activated by binding to C-reactive protein that is bound to microbial constituents or material such as chromatin released from dead or dying cells. C1q can also be activated by binding directly to apoptotic cells. The lectin pathway is initiated by the binding of mannose-binding lectin to carbohydrates found on bacterial cell surfaces, and also proceeds via C2 and C4. The alternative pathway is activated by pathogens or by other entities such as damaged cells that do not express complement-inhibitory proteins or are unable to bind those in the circulation. The alternative pathway also acts as an amplification system once C3 is activated by the other pathways.

containing DNA (nucleosomes) and others containing RNA (nuclear and cytoplasmic riboproteins); cell-surface components, including negatively charged phospholipids (phosphatidylserine); and a few plasma proteins such as Clq and β2 glycoprotein. Central to understanding the pathogenesis of SLE is identification of the source of these autoantigens, particularly as many of them are intracellular molecules, and to understand how B cells that react with these antigens are generated.

The role of apoptotic cells

A major insight into the first of these two issues came with the observation that a common link between many of the antigens in SLE is that they are translocated to the cell surface when cells undergo apoptosis.² This observation suggests that apoptotic cells are an important source of antigenic material in SLE. This conclusion is supported by the observation that immunization of mice with apoptotic cells can lead to the generation of antibodies against single-stranded

to be inappropriately accessible to cells of the immune system, with the consequent generation of an autoimmune response. Subsequently, deficiencies of several other proteins that are involved in the clearance of apoptotic cells, or of waste products of cell destruction such as chromatin and DNA, have also been shown to lead to autoimmunity in mice. These include C4, IgM, c-mer proto-oncogene tyrosine kinase, deoxyribonuclease 1, tissue transglutaminase type 2, and milk fat globule epidermal growth factor 8 protein. In keeping with this hypothesis, macrophages from patients with SLE also show impaired phagocytosis of apoptotic cells.

### The balance between tolerance and immunity

The challenge now is to define the mechanisms by which impaired clearance of cellular waste leads to autoantibody synthesis. Dendritic cells are likely to be a key part of this process because they have a central role in the generation of the immune response by presenting antigens to T cells. Dendritic cells only stimulate the T-cell response once they have been activated by other signals of tissue injury and become mature; in their immature state, processing of antigen by dendritic cells leads to tolerance. Several studies have shown that complement can enhance uptake of apoptotic cells by immature dendritic cells. It is likely that this rapid uptake prevents the release of intracellular material that could activate the dendritic cells, and also leads to synthesis of cytokines that maintain the dendritic cells in an immature state and so maintain tolerance. One could speculate, therefore, that a major role of complement in waste disposal is not to keep the antigens on apoptotic cells away from the immune system, but in fact to enhance the uptake of these antigen-presenting cells, in a way that promotes the maintenance of tolerance rather than an autoimmune response.

A separate pathway by which complement might be important in maintaining tolerance has been proposed by Carroll. During development, B cells, in a similar way to T cells, undergo a process of negative selection which deletes potentially self-reactive cells. Developing B cells express a receptor complex of complement receptor 2 together with CD19 and CD81. It is proposed that uptake of material such as cell debris, which is coated with activated C4, can engage this receptor with subsequent deletion of the B cell.

There are, therefore, three potential ways by which failure of the normal complement-mediated handling of dying cells might lead to autoimmunity: first, by failure of clearance leading to antigen overload; second, by inappropriate dendritic-cell responses leading to a failure to maintain tolerance; and third, by a failure to delete autoreactive B cells. These hypotheses are not mutually exclusive and all three processes might have a role.

### COMPLEMENT AND TISSUE INJURY IN SYSTEMIC LUPUS ERYTHEMATOSUS

So far, we have considered the role of complement in the generation of autoimmunity in SLE. We will now focus on the role of complement in tissue injury. Much of these data come from studies of mouse models of SLE and relate to glomerulonephritis, which is the most prominent manifestation of disease in most of these models and a major cause of morbidity and mortality in individuals with SLE. The models that have been studied include those previously described, in which deficiencies of C1q or C4 lead to autoimmunity, and mouse strains that are genetically predisposed to autoimmunity, of which the best-characterized are MRL-`lpr/lpr` MICE and NZB/NZW MICE. In all of these models, immunoglobulins and complement components are deposited in glomeruli. From knowledge of the functions of the complement system (Figure 1), two opposing effects of complement activation might be predicted: first, the role of complement in enhancing immune complex clearance might be expected to reduce glomerular injury; second, the generation of activated complement products at the site of immune-complex deposition would be expected to enhance injury. As we shall see, there is evidence for both of these opposing effects *in vivo*.

### How important is complement activation in lupus nephritis?

It is clear from these models that complement is not of overriding importance for glomerular injury. We have shown that `C1qa−/−` mice, even when crossed with mice lacking factor B and C2 and thus unable to activate C3, still develop proliferative immune-complex glomerulonephritis. Similar results were found in `C4−/−` mice, in which glomerular IgG deposition and histology were similar whether or not the mice expressed C3. It is likely that glomerular injury in these mice depends primarily on recognition of

glomerular immune complexes by Fc RECEPTORS on circulating leukocytes or intrinsic glomerular cells. A clear role for Fc receptors has been demonstrated in the NZB/NZW model: mice lacking activator Fc receptors were protected from severe nephritis despite deposition of immune complexes and C3 in glomeruli. By contrast, glomerulonephritis in MRL-`lpr/lpr` mice is reported to be independent of Fc receptors.

At first glance, these results seem to suggest that complement is of little importance in glomerular injury in SLE. As mentioned earlier, however, there are potentially opposing effects of complement activation in clearing immune complexes and in causing local tissue injury, and it is possible that, in the studies in which C3 activation is prevented, these opposing effects cancel each other out. Evidence of a role for complement in immune-complex clearance was provided by a study in MRL-`lpr/lpr` mice. The authors of this study crossed MRL-`lpr/lpr` mice with `C3−/−` mice and found that in the absence of C3 there were similar levels of circulating autoantibodies as in the C3-replete mice. The `C3−/−` mice, however, had increased glomerular IgG deposition and significantly greater albuminuria, suggesting that there was reduced clearance of glomerular immune complexes in the absence of C3.

#### Implications for therapeutic interventions

Clearance of immune complexes is dependent on activation of the classical pathway. If the effects of complement on immune complex clearance and local inflammation are opposing, it might, therefore, be predicted that the best therapeutic strategy would be to allow activation of C3 via the classical pathway, and to block either the alternative pathway, which can amplify local complement activation, or to block the downstream products of C3 activation including the anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a, and the membrane attack complex (C5b–9). There is evidence from animal models that these strategies might reduce renal injury to some extent. In MRL-`lpr/lpr` mice, absence of factor D, which prevents alternative pathway activation, leads to reduced glomerular C3 deposition, showing that the alternative pathway can amplify local complement activation. The factor D−/− mice had less glomerular hypercellularity and lower serum creatinine levels than the factor-D-replete mice. There were, however, no differences in proteinuria or renal survival, again underscoring the importance of complement-independent (most

likely Fc-receptor-dependent) mechanisms of glomerular injury in lupus glomerulonephritis.

A number of therapeutic studies have been carried out in these lupus models. Administration of an anti-C5 antibody led to marked amelioration of glomerular disease and improved survival in the NZB/NZW mouse model.²⁴ In MRL-lpr/lpr mice, albuminuria and renal failure were reduced by administration of a small-molecule antagonist of the C3a receptor,²⁵ and similar beneficial results were obtained using an antagonist of the C5a receptor.²⁶ These results suggest that it might be worthwhile to explore the effects of inhibitors of the alternative pathway or of C3a and C5a receptors in humans.

### ANTI-C1Q ANTIBODIES AND LUPUS GLOMERULONEPHRITIS

Many patients with SLE have autoantibodies that bind to the collagenous tail of C1q.²⁷ The occurrence of these anti-C1q antibodies is strongly associated with hypocomplementemia and renal involvement.²⁸ Recent work by Daha’s research group has elucidated the role of these autoantibodies in lupus nephritis. Lupus-prone mice developed circulating anti-C1q antibodies that deposited in the kidney before the development of nephritis,²⁹ suggesting that these antibodies might contribute to the pathogenesis of glomerular disease. When monoclonal mouse anti-C1q antibodies were injected into non-autoimmune strains of mice, the recipients showed a reduction in circulating C1q levels and deposition of C1q and IgG within glomeruli, with minor renal injury.³⁰ When these antibodies were then administered to Rag2⁻/⁻ immunoglobulin-deficient mice, there was a reduction in circulating C1q levels but no glomerular C1q deposition, implying that IgG in the glomerulus acts as a target for the attachment of C1q, which can then bind anti-C1q antibodies. Most importantly, if anti-C1q antibodies were given together with complement-fixing antibodies directed against the glomerular basement membrane, there was marked deposition of C1q and immunoglobulin, together with significant glomerular inflammation. These effects did not occur if either antibody was administered alone. This study provides evidence that anti-C1q antibodies can exacerbate antibody-mediated glomerular injury. The use of mouse models with targeted disruption of different genes showed that glomerular injury was dependent on C3, C4 and Fc receptors. The

authors suggested that binding of anti-C1q antibodies led to activation of the classical pathway followed by generation of chemotactic complement fragments, inflammatory cell influx and stimulation of these cells via Fc receptors. It is also possible that the anti-C1q antibodies could have interfered with normal, noninflammatory, C1q-mediated, apoptotic-cell clearance in glomeruli, leading to enhanced uptake of apoptotic cells as a consequence of proinflammatory mechanisms.³¹ This possibility is perhaps less likely, however, given that glomerular injury in these mice occurs within 24 h. One caveat in interpreting this study is that the antibody used is monoclonal and recognizes C1q in the circulation, in contrast to human polyclonal antibodies that do not recognize the circulating form of C1q.

### COMPLEMENT AND ANTIPHOSPHOLIPID SYNDROME

Antiphospholipid antibodies are present in up to one-third of patients with SLE and antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) develops in 50–70% of these patients. The clinical manifestations are recurrent arterial and venous thrombosis, and recurrent miscarriage. A series of studies by Salmon, Girardi and colleagues has elucidated the role of the complement system in fetal loss in APS (Figure 3). They studied a model in which pregnant mice were inoculated with human IgG isolated from patients with APS. The mice developed intrauterine fetal death with reduced weight of the remaining viable fetuses. The administered antibody localized to the uterine decidua, where there was neutrophil infiltration, focal necrosis and loss of fetal membranes. This was accompanied by the deposition of C3.³² Mice genetically deficient for C3 or treated with the C3 convertase inhibitor Crry-Ig (immunoglobulin bound to the product of complement-receptor-related gene y) were protected against fetal injury without any change in the deposition of human IgG in the placenta. In further studies,³³ they showed that the Fc portion of the antiphospholipid antibody was necessary for development of intrauterine fetal death, and that mice lacking C4 were protected whereas those lacking activatory Fc receptors were susceptible. This finding strongly implies that initial injury is due to antibody binding, leading to activation of C3 via the classical pathway. There is also a role for the alternative complement pathway in this model, because factor B⁻/⁻ mice were also protected against fetal loss, indicating that this pathway amplifies the initial injury. The
Figure 3 An overview of the mechanisms of fetal loss in antiphospholipid syndrome. Antiphospholipid antibodies bind to the placenta and activate the classical complement pathway. This leads to deposition of C3b on the decidua and to the generation of anaphylatoxins and activators of inflammatory cells, particularly C5a. C5a attracts neutrophils and stimulates the release of inflammatory mediators including reactive oxygen species and proteolytic enzymes. Neutrophils accelerate the activation of the alternative pathway and synthesise C3 and properdin. C5 activation also leads to the formation of the membrane attack complex which might produce tissue damage. Tumor necrosis factor synthesis is stimulated, and this enhances tissue injury through tumor necrosis factor receptors.

importance of the alternative complement pathway in amplifying injury is emphasized by the ability of a monoclonal antibody to factor B to reduce fetal loss substantially.³⁴

### Which complement components are involved in injury and fetal loss?

The authors then investigated which complement components were responsible for injury and showed that mice lacking C5, or treated with an anti-C5 antibody, were protected.³³ Activation of C5 might lead to injury both through formation of the membrane attack complex (C5b–9) or by generation of the anaphylatoxin and cell activator C5a. The role of C5a was demonstrated using either C5a-receptor⁻/⁻ mice or by treating mice with a specific peptide antagonist of C5a; pregnancy loss and fetal growth restriction were prevented in both of these models. C5a is a potent chemotactic agent for neutrophils, which are seen infiltrating the placenta in these models, and the authors further demonstrated that treatment with an antineutrophil antibody

prevented neutrophil infiltration and fetal loss. A novel finding was that C3 deposition in the uterine decidua was reduced in the absence of neutrophils, indicating that infiltrating cells can regulate local complement activation.

Further experiments also showed that tumor necrosis factor (TNF) was a downstream mediator of C5 activation. Administration of antiphospholipid antibodies to pregnant mice led to a rapid rise in the levels of TNF in the circulation and in decidual tissue.³⁵ This increase in TNF was not seen in C5⁻/⁻ mice, implying that the rise was secondary to C5 activation. The pathophysiologic role of TNF was confirmed by showing protection from fetal loss in mice lacking TNF or in mice in which TNF activity was blocked by administration of a soluble TNF receptor.

### Heparin and fetal loss

Anticoagulation with heparin is a standard prophylactic approach against obstetric complications of APS. Studies in the mouse model of APS described above showed that the ability

of heparin to prevent fetal loss depended not on its anticoagulant activity but on its anti-complement activity, particularly inhibition of classical pathway activation.³⁶ Other anticoagulants—such as hirudin, which does not inhibit complement—were ineffective.

### Cardiovascular disease

The role of complement in venous thrombosis has been studied using a mouse model of femoral vein thrombosis.³⁷ In this model, administration of antiphospholipid antibodies increased thrombus size and leukocyte adhesion to endothelium, but mice lacking C3 or C5 were protected.

Even in SLE patients without APS, there is an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and, in particular, of coronary artery disease. A recent study suggests that the increased risk might depend, in part, on the activity of the lectin pathway of complement activation.³⁸ Serum levels of mannose-binding lectin vary widely from person to person because there are variant alleles that affect the stability of the protein. Individuals with B, C or D variant alleles have lower levels of mannose-binding lectin than those with the A allele. In patients with SLE, homozygosity for the B, C or D variant alleles is associated with an increased risk of arterial thrombosis but not of venous thrombosis. The mechanisms responsible for this effect remain to be determined, but possibilities include increased disease activity, which has been previously reported in SLE patients with B, C or D variant alleles;³⁹ increased susceptibility to infection with, for example, *Chlamydia pneumoniae*, which has been implicated in atherosclerosis; or a failure to clear apoptotic cells and other atherogenic material. Given the link between atherosclerosis and morbidity in patients with SLE, further research in this area is likely to be of considerable importance.

### CONCLUSIONS

Recent studies of mouse models of autoimmunity that used animals deficient in specific complement components or administered inhibitors of components of the complement pathway have provided new insights into the mechanisms of autoantibody production and tissue injury in SLE. A better understanding of these mechanisms might lead to the design of more rational ways to manipulate the complement pathway in the treatment of human SLE.
