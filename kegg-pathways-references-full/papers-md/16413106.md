Fig. 1. Interconversion of corticosterone to 11-dehydrocorticosterone by 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogen
of the nuclear glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in the hippocampus and hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN), presumably improving glucocorticoid feedback in absence of 11β-HSD1 activity (Carter, Tworowska and Holmes, unpublished data). However, this compensatory change in the HPA axis does not modify the behavioural changes which are consistent through all backgrounds tested (
tral 11β-HSD2 in regulating blood pressure ([Gomez-Sanchez and Gomez-Sanchez, 1992](https://doi.org/10.1038/nm0592-476)).

High levels of glucocorticoids have deleterious actions in development, inhibiting cell proliferation and differentiation. The brain is an important target for these
clearance of corticosterone and/or the SAME phenotype, but may mask any hyperactivity of the HPA axis induced by glucocorticoid programming. Alternatively, the C57Bl/6 mouse may be more resistant to glucocorticoid programming of the HPA axis than the rat, perhaps reflecting the differences in maternal, placental and fetal glucocorticoid environments.

In conclusion, 11β-H
