### Abstract

We have reported recently the identification and characterization of the last three mitochondrial cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP) controlling the biosynthesis of 20-hydroxyecdysone, the molting hormone of insects. These are encoded by the following genes: *disembodied* (*dib*, *Cyp302al*, the 22-hydroxylase); *shadow* (*sad*, *Cyp315al*, the 2-hydroxylase); and *shade* (*shd*, *Cyp314al*, the 20-hydroxylase). Employing similar gene identification and transfection techniques and subsequent biochemical analysis of the expressed enzymatic activity, we report the identity of the *Drosophila* gene *phantom* (*phm*), located at 17D1 of the X chromosome, as encoding the microsomal 25-hydroxylase (*Cyp306al*). Similar analysis following differential display-based gene identification has also resulted in the characterization of the corresponding 25-hydroxylase gene in *Bombyx mori*. Confirmation of 2,22,25-trideoxyecdysone (3β,5β-ketodiol) conversion to 2,22-dideoxyecdysone (3β,5β-ketotriol) mediated by either Phm enzyme employed LC, MS and definitive NMR analysis. In situ developmental gene analysis, in addition to northern, western and RT-PCR techniques during *Drosophila* embryonic, larval and adult development, are consistent with this identification. That is, strong expression of *phm* is restricted to the prothoracic gland cells of the *Drosophila* larval ring gland, where it undergoes dramatic changes in expression, and in the adult ovary, but also in the embryonic epidermis. During the last larval-larval transition in *Bombyx*, a similar expression pattern in the prothoracic gland is observed, but as in *Drosophila*, slight expression is also present in other tissues, suggesting a possible additional role for the phantom enzyme.

### 1. Introduction

Although the structures of ecdysone (E) and 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E: the principal molting hormone of arthropods) have been known for about five decades, the detailed biosynthetic pathway of these polyhydroxylated steroids has remained elusive despite considerable effort by several laboratories. The problem in using conventional analytical protocols was due
to the minute quantities of both enzymes and intermediates and their lability.

Over the past several years, we have utilized the genetics of *Drosophila melanogaster* and a combination of molecular and biochemical paradigms to identify the genes encoding enzymes mediating three of the four terminal hydroxylation steps that yield 20E, i.e. the 2-, 22- and 20-hydroxylases (monooxygenases) (Warren et al., 2002; Petryk et al., 2003; see Gilbert et al., 2002; Gilbert, 2004; Lafont et al., 2004). These studies utilized data from previous cytogenetic analyses of several genes (the Halloween genes) which, when mutated, failed to form a normal cuticle, resulting in embryonic lethality (Jürgens et al., 1984; Nüsslein-Volhard et al., 1984; Wieschaus et al., 1984), due presumably to low ecdysteroid levels (Chávez et al., 2000). These genes were also identified in a screen for mutations that disrupt the formation of the central nervous system in *Drosophila* (Hummel et al., 1999). The fourth gene involved in terminal ecdysteroid hydroxylations is the subject of the present work which demonstrates that *phantom* encodes the 25-hydroxylase, not only in *Drosophila*, but also in the lepidopteran, *Bombyx mori*.

### 2. Materials and methods

#### 2.1. Insects

The *Drosophila* mutant strain, *phm<sup>E7</sup>*, was obtained from the Bloomington Stock Center and raised on standard cornmeal/yeast extract/dextrose medium (Chávez et al., 2000). Embryonic staging was according to Campos-Ortega and Hartenstein (1985). Wild type *Drosophila* embryos and larvae were synchronized at egg laying, hatching and after each molt to the succeeding larval instar. Late (wandering) third instar larvae were within 6–8 h of pupariation. Ovaries and testes were from mature adults at least 3 days after eclosion. Prothoracic glands were dissected from day 7, fifth instar *Manduca sexta* larvae and kept frozen (−70 °C) until thawed and incubated with various radiolabeled intermediates.

*B. mori* (Kinshu × Showa F<sub>1</sub> hybrid) were reared on an artificial diet (Silkmate, Nihon Nosan Kogyo) at 25 °C under a 12 h light/12 h dark cycle. Staging was according to Kiguchi and Agui (1981) and Kiguchi et al. (1985).

#### 2.2. Synthetic ecdysteroid precursors and related compounds

The ecdysteroid intermediate 5β[H]-3β,14α-dihydroxy-cholesta-7-ene-6-one (2,22,25-trideoxyecdysone; 2,22,25dE; 3β,5β[H]-ketodiol), along with 25-deoxyecdysone (25dE), 22-deoxyecdysone (22dE) and 2-deoxyecdysone (2dE) were gifts of Dr. R. Lafont (Université P. et M. Curie, Paris). The high specific activity ecdysteroid precursor 22,23-[<sup>3</sup>H]-5β[H]-3β,14α,25-trihydroxy-cholesta-7-ene-6-one (<sup>3</sup>H-2,22-dideoxyecdysone; <sup>3</sup>H-2,22dE; <sup>3</sup>H-3β,5β[H]-ketotriol) (60 Ci/mmol) was a gift from Dr. C. Kappler (Université Louis Pasteur, Strasbourg). For clarity and consistency, it should be noted that for ecdysteroid molecules with either two or three hydroxyl functions, we are using the generic terms ketodiol and ketotriol. The term ketodiol commonly refers to the 3β,14α,5β[H]-ketodiol intermediate in E biosynthesis, while ketotriol has been used in the past to refer to only 22,25-dideoxyecdysone, which is not an intermediate in E biosynthesis. Two closely related non-labeled isomeric ecdysteroid ketodiol, 5α[H]-3β,14α-dihydroxy-cholesta-7-ene-6-one (3β,14α,5α[H]-ketodiol) and 5α[H]-3α,14α-dihydroxycholesta-7-ene-6-one (3α,14α,5α[H]-ketodiol), along with other ecdysteroid compounds, 5β[H]-2β,3β-dihydroxy-cholesta-7-ene-6-one (2β,3β,14-deoxy,5β[H]-ketodiol), 5α[H]-2β,3β,14α-trihydroxy-cholesta-7-ene-6-one (2β,3β,14α,5α[H]-ketotriol) and 5β[H]-3β,14α,22R-trihydroxy-cholesta-7-ene-6-one (3β,14α,22(R),5β[H]-ketotriol) were gifts of Dr. D. Horn. E and 20E standards were purchased from Sigma/Aldrich. [<sup>3</sup>H]-E (60 Ci/mmol) and [<sup>3</sup>H]-ponasterone A ([<sup>3</sup>H]-25-deoxy-20-hydroxyecdysone, <sup>3</sup>H]-ponA; 100 Ci/mmol) were purchased from NEN.

#### 2.3. Phenotypic characterization of *Drosophila phantom* mutant embryos

Cuticle preparations, staining for spectrin (an actin-binding membrane and cytoskeletal component) and IMP-E1 (a 20E-inducible early gene) expression in *Drosophila* embryos have been described previously (Chávez et al., 2000).

#### 2.4. Gene cloning and identification of the *phantom* mutation in *Drosophila*

The full length cDNA sequence of the wild type *Dmphm* gene was amplified from a *Drosophila* embryonic cDNA library in pNB40 (Brown and Kafatos, 1988) by PCR using the MACH amplification protocol (Haerry and O’Connor, 2002) as described previously (Warren et al., 2002; Petryk et al., 2003). Two pairs of primers were designed on the 5′ end (A + B) and 3′ end (C + D):

DmPhmA: 5′-CCAGCTTCTGGAGTGACTTGTG-C-3′,

DmPhmB: 5′-CCAAGCGGTATGGTGGAATTTTCGAG-3′,

DmPhmC: 5′-GCCAAGTAGAGCAGGAACCAG-C-3′,
DmPhmD: 5′-CCGCGAAACAACGCTGCCAGC-3′. Dmphm cDNA was cloned into the S2 expression vector pBRAcPA under the control of the actin 5C promoter (T.E. Haerry and M.B. O'Connor, unpublished).

To identify the mutation site in the Dmphm mutant, genomic DNA from heterozygous animals was amplified by PCR using the primers 5′-GTCGG-GATCCGAGAATCTGG-3′ and 5′-AAATGCCTT-CAAAAAGTGATTTGCCC-3′ and sequenced using the Thermosequenase Cycle Sequencing Kit (USB Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The mutant lesion was identified by the presence of two bases at a particular position which correspond to either the mutant or balancer genomic sequences.

### 2.5. Initial identification of a cDNA fragment of Bombyx phantom

Using RNA templates derived from precisely staged fourth and fifth instar prothoracic glands, a developmental fluorescent mRNA differential display technique (FDD) was employed, first to obtain an initial cDNA fragment of the Bmphm gene in a manner similar to that described previously (Shinoda and Itoyama, 2003). Following the sequencing of about 400 cDNA bands, all of which showed a variety of potentially interesting developmental patterns in the FDD analysis, the partial sequences of two putative prothoracic gland-specific cytochrome P450 (CYP) genes were identified. Preliminary RT-PCR analysis using specific primers for these cDNAs revealed that both genes (PG04j and PG19t) were indeed expressed specifically in the prothoracic glands. One of them, PG04j, was investigated further.

### 2.6. Cloning of full-length Bombyx phantom by RACE

The 5′ and 3′ ends of the complete Bmphm cDNA were obtained by a modified RACE method using a SMART-RACE cDNA amplification kit (Clontech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Prothoracic gland RNA from each of the 24 developmental stages used for FDD analysis were mixed and used for the synthesis of the template first-strand cDNAs. Specific primers for 5′- and 3′-RACE were designed based on the sequence of the PG04j FDD fragment: 5′-RACE primer R1, 5′-ACGGTTCCACGCATCTCT TCTGCTGTCGG-3′, 3′-RACE primer F1, 5′-ACAG-CAGAAGAGATGCGTGGAACCGTCCG-3′. The 5′-RACE and 3′-RACE products showed major bands of ~1.8 and ~0.3 kb, respectively. These were sub-cloned into vector pCR2.1 (Invitrogen) and several of the longest clones were selected and sequenced. The 5′-RACE clones showed almost identical sequences suggesting that they contained the near 5′-end sequence of the transcript. The 3′-RACE clones contained putative poly(A) tails. A full-length sequence of Bmphm (1963 bp) was constructed by combining the sequences of the initial FDD fragment and the 5′- and 3′-RACE products. The Bmphm open reading frame was amplified from the first strand cDNA by PCR with primers F2, 5′-AAAGATCT ATGGACCTTTATTTTATTTG-GCTGG-3′, containing an additional BglII site for subcloning (underlined), and R2, 5′-AAAGGTATA-TTCCGTGAAAC-3′, using a proofreading polymerase (PfuTurbo, Stratagene). The products were then subcloned into the cloning vector pDrive (Qiagen). Six independent clones were sequenced and a PCR error-free clone (pDrive/Bmphm) was selected and used for further analysis.

In order to perform metabolic expression studies with *Drosophila* S2 cells, the coding sequence for Bmphm was first excised from the above pDrive cloning vector using BglII and then ligated into expression vector pBRAcPA. Clones exhibiting the proper orientation were selected following restriction analysis using BamHI.

### 2.7. Transfection of S2 cells with gene expression plasmids

S2 cells were transfected (Ross et al., 2001) with either wild-type Dmphm or Bmphm cDNA or with a control construct constitutively expressing the GFP protein (Bhanot et al., 1996) using dimethyl dioctadecyl ammonium bromide (Han, 1996; Warren et al., 2002; Petryk et al., 2003). In alternative transfection experiments, either all four *Drosophila* Halloween genes (Dmphm, dib, sad and shd) or Bmphm together with the three *Drosophila* genes dib, sad and shd, were simultaneously transfected into S2 cells.

### 2.8. Incubation of transfected S2 cells with various ecdysteroid substrates

Three days following transfection, the cells were harvested by gentle centrifugation and the medium was decanted. The cells were then homogenized with a tight fitting plastic pestle into fresh medium (1 ml), Shields and Sang M3 Medium (Sigma) supplemented with Insect Medium Supplement (Sigma) and containing Tween-20 (0.001%) and 4–12 μg (approximately 10–30 μM) of a non-radiolabeled early ecdysteroid precursor, i.e. the 3β,5β[H]-ketodiol (Warren et al., 2002). Finally, solid NADPH was added (to 0.5 mM) and incubation proceeded at room temperature for 6–8 h with gentle agitation. Alternatively, the cells were incubated with various other non-labeled ecdysteroids, i.e. related structural isomers such as the 3β,14α,5α[H]-ketodiol and the 3α,14α,5α[H]-ketodiol, in addition to 25dE and

the unusual ecdysteroid compounds 2β,3β,14-deoxy,5β[H]-ketodiol, 2β,3β,14α,5α[H]-ketotriol and 3β,14α,22(R),5β[H]-ketotriol or with 1 μCi of either [³H]-ponA or [³H]-cholesterol.

### 2.9. Purification and characterization of the products of Dmphp and Bmphm metabolic activity

The residues from methanol extracts of the various incubation mixtures were subjected to RP-HPLC using a Resolve C₁₈ column (Waters) and a slow 30–100% methanol gradient (Warren et al., 2001, 2002; Petryk et al., 2003). Resulting peak product fractions, identified by their more polar character and characteristic ecdysteroid-like UV spectra (UVmax, 248 nm), were pooled, evaporated and further purified by normal-phase (NP)-HPTLC (silica gel developed with chloroform:methanol 9:1) prior to their subsequent structural analysis. In the case of the products resulting from the incubation of the unlabeled 3β,5β[H]-ketodiol substrate with S2 cells simultaneously transfected with either all four *Drosophila* Halloween genes (i.e. Dmphp, dib, sad and shd) or with Bmphm together with *Drosophila* dib, sad and shd, they were resolved by similar RP-HPLC, but were detected by their UV₂₄₈ nm absorption and/or their ecdysteroid RIA immunoreactivity (Warren and Gilbert, 1986, 1988; Warren et al., 2002).

Additional structural characterization of the products of either DmPhm or BmPhm mediated metabolism of the 3β,5β[H]-ketodiol employed liquid chromatography (LC) [elution by 50% acetonitrile/0.1% acetic acid of a C₁₈-Zorbax (Agilent) column, 0.1 ml/min] coupled to electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectroscopic (MS) analysis (LCQ Deca ion trap, Finnigan) (Warren et al., 2002; Petryk et al., 2003). The final unambiguous identification of these products as the 3β,5β[H]-ketotriol employed high-field ¹H-NMR (500 MHz, Bruker) in d₄-methanol with additional g-COSY (homonuclear 2-dimensional correlation spectroscopy) and g-NOESY (nuclear Overhauser effect correlation spectroscopy) analysis.

To further characterize each of the above metabolic products, their subsequent metabolism (together with 1 μCi of standard [³H]-3β,5β[H]-ketotriol) by homogenates of *M. sexta* larval prothoracic glands was similarly analyzed by RP-HPLC and NP-HPTLC (Grieneisen et al., 1991, 1993; Warren and Gilbert, 1996; Warren et al., 1999).

### 2.10. Endogenous *Drosophila* embryonic ecdysteroid titers and composition

Dechorionated, homozygous mutant DmphpmE⁷ embryos, mechanically sorted from heterozygous mutant DmphpmE⁷-kruppel-GFP embryos (4–8 h old)

by their lack of expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP) (Copas Select, Harvard Bioscience, Holliston, MA), or wild type embryos of the same age, were homogenized and extracted exhaustively with methanol (Warren et al., 2002; Petryk et al., 2003). Aliquots of the pooled extracts from replicate 20 mg samples (about 2000 embryos each) were subjected to radioimmunoassay (RIA) employing the H22 antibody (Warren and Gilbert, 1986, 1988).

The remaining pooled extracts from wild type embryos, or from either sorted homozygous or heterozygous mutant DmphpmE⁷ embryos, were subjected to additional RP-HPLC analysis using RIA-based detection employing both the H22 antibody (which detects E, 20E and mainly side-chain modified metabolites) and the SHO-3 antibody (which also detects E and 20E, but mainly A-ring metabolites in contrast to the H22 antibody) (Kiriishi et al., 1990; Petryk et al., 2003).

### 2.11. Whole-mount RNA in situ hybridization and RT-PCR of Dmphpm

RNA hybridization and detection procedures for embryonic, larval and adult tissue samples were according to standard protocols (Chávez et al., 2000; Warren et al., 2002; Petryk et al., 2003). To obtain the Dmphpm RNA antisense probe, pNB40-phm was linearized with *Bgl*II and transcribed with the T7 promoter. For the Dmphpm sense probe, pNB40-Dmphpm was linearized with *Not*I and transcribed with the SP6 promoter.

Total RNA was extracted from tissues of wandering third instar *Drosophila* larvae and adults and analyzed by RT-PCR (Warren et al., 2002; Petryk et al., 2003), using primers specific for Dmphpm (*PhmUp1* 5′-CGCTCTCATCGGCACAAAAT-3′ and *PhmDo1* 5′-AGCAGCACCACTCCCATTTTC-3′) and rpL17 (*L17Up1* 5′-GTGATGAACTGTGCCGACAA-3′ and *L17Do1* 5′-CCTTCATTTCGCCCTTGTGTG-3′).

### 2.12. Developmental tissue expression of Bmphm by QRT-PCR

The expression of the Bmphm transcript was analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR (QRT-PCR) using a real-time thermal cycler (LightCycler, Roche). Total RNA extracted from various precisely staged tissues was treated with RNase-free DNase I, converted to cDNAs with an oligo (dT)₁₈ primer and MMLV reverse transcriptase (Clontech), and the cDNAs were used as the templates of QRT-PCR. Two primer sets were designed for Bmphm: QF1, 5′-TTATGGCAGCAATCTGTGAAACTC-3′ and QR1, 5′-TTCTGGTTTCTCCCCAAACATTAGG-3′; QF2, 5′-GGAAATGGGATTATTGTGCCGAAGG-3′ and QR2 5′-GGCAGC

ATCAGAAGTTTTTTCG-3'. The presence of two introns in the sequences of QF2, and between QF2 and QR2 would completely eliminate the amplification of any possible contaminating genomic DNA in the sample (T. Shinoda, unpublished data). Serial dilutions of a pCR2.1 plasmid containing only the above described 5'-RACE PG04j product fragment were used as standards to quantify Bmphm expression, while ribosomal gene rp49 was chosen as an internal reference. The primers for rp49 were 5'-CAGGCAGGTCAAGGGTC AATAC-3' and 5'-TGCTGGGCTCTTCCACGA-3'. Serial dilutions of a pCR2.1 plasmid containing a 340 bp rp49 cDNA were used as standards for ribosomal gene expression. PCR conditions and the data analysis were essentially the same as described previously (Shinoda and Itoyama, 2003).

### 2.13. Northern blot analysis

Total RNA was extracted with TRIzol reagent (Gibco BRL) from late second instar and early (feeding) and late (wandering) third instar *Drosophila* larvae and mRNA was isolated (PolyATtract mRNA isolation system, Promega). A 1.3 kb fragment of the *Cyp306al* cDNA was used as the probe following digoxigenin (DIG) labeling by PCR employing the DIG-DNA labeling mixture (Roche) and two specific primers (DmPhmUp1: 5'-GCTCGTCCTGGTGATTC-TCT-3' and DmPhmDo1: 5'-CTGAGGATGCGACC CGTAAA-3'). A Dig-labeled fragment (300 bp) of the cDNA encoding the rpL17A ribosomal protein of *Drosophila* was used as control probe (L17Up1 5'-GTGATGAACTGTGCCGACAA-3' and L17Do1 5'-CCTTCATTTTCGCCCTTGT TG-3'). Equal amounts of mRNA (10 μg) were separated on a 1.2% formaldehyde gel and transferred onto a positively charged nylon membrane (Hybond-N+, Amersham Pharmacia). Following overnight 50°C hybridization, chemiluminescent detection was performed as previously described (Dauphin-Villemant et al., 1999).

Similarly, a DIG-labeled cRNA probe (~1.5 kb) specific for Bmphm was prepared from the pDrive/Bmphm construct (digested with MluI) by using SP6 transcriptase (Roche Biochemicals). Total RNA (5 μg) extracted from day 6, fifth instar spinning stage larval prothoracic glands and other tissues was separated in a denaturing agarose gel (1%) and subsequently blotted onto the nylon membrane. Hybridization, washing, and detection were performed essentially as described (Charles et al., 1999).

### 2.14. Preparation of polyclonal anti-Dmphm antibodies and western blot analysis

Polycional antibodies were elicited in rabbits against a selected phantom peptide sequence, QRQLEKEQL RQSKEADPSQC, by FabGennix International (Shreveport, LA). The serum was then affinity purified against the phantom peptide. Tissues from third instar *Drosophila* larvae were dissected under ice-cold phosphate buffer and homogenized in Tris-HCl (20 mM) containing 1 μl of protease inhibition cocktail (Sigma). The homogenate was centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5 min. Protein content of the supernatant was measured by the method of Bradford (Bio-Rad Ltd) with bovine catalase as standard (Sigma). Samples (15 μg of total proteins) were incubated for 30 min at 40°C in sample buffer (0.2 M Tris–HCl, 3% SDS, 25% glycerol, 0.02% β-mercaptoethanol). Proteins were separated by Tris-glycine–SDS continuous 7% polyacrylamide gels, then transferred overnight to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (transfer buffer: 25 mM Tris-base, 192 mM glycine, 20% methanol).

After blocking for 1 h in blocking buffer (PBS with 0.5% Tween-20 and 5% non-fat milk), membranes were incubated with a 1:500 dilution of primary antibody (polyclonal anti-phantom peptide) in blocking buffer at room temperature. Membranes were washed six times in PBS with 0.5% Tween-20 and then incubated for 1 h with a 1:5000 dilution of a horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Sigma) in blocking buffer. After six washes of 15 min in PBS with 0.5% Tween-20, antigen-antibody complexes were detected with the chemiluminescent ECL western blotting detection kit (NEN Life Sciences Products, USA).

### 2.15. Subcellular localization of *Drosophila* phantom

The Dmphm coding sequence, tagged at the C-terminal with a three copy hemagglutinin (HA) epitope, was co-transfected with an endoplasmic reticulum (mSpitz-GFP) marker (Tsruya et al., 2002). Three days after transfection, the cells were fixed and stained as described previously (Warren et al., 2002; Petryk et al., 2003). Individual optical sections are shown.

## 3. Results

### 3.1. Identification of Dmphm as Cyp306al

Using the *Drosophila* genome database (http://flybase.bio.indiana.edu) (Adams et al., 2000) in our previous studies, the genes disembodied (*dib*), shadow (*sad*) and shade (*shd*) were found to code for the ecdysteroid C₂₂- (*Cyp302al*), C₂- (*Cyp315al*) and C₂₀-terminal hydroxylases (*Cyp314al*) (Warren et al., 2002; Petryk et al., 2003) (Fig. 1). Similarly, for the Dmphm gene located at the 17C5-D2 cytological interval of the X chromosome (Wieschaus et al., 1984), *Cyp306al* (17D1) was identified as a potential candidate for the 25-hydroxylase. To confirm this tentative identity of

Dmphm, genomic DNA from the Dmphm<sup>E7</sup> mutant allele was sequenced and a base alteration was identified for amino acid 286 (Q) that leads to formation of a stop codon (Fig. 2).

### 3.2. Sequence comparison of Dmphm and Bmphm

Employing the fluorescent differential display technique (FDD), a gene similar to Dmphm was identified in the larval prothoracic glands of Bombyx. The deduced amino acid sequence of the Bombyx gene compared to that of the *Drosophila* gene revealed 37% identity, with an additional 18% of the amino acids judged to be similar (Fig. 2). Structural attributes of many CYPs were also present (Feyereisen, 2004), i.e., well-conserved domains attributed to heme-binding (PFxxGxRxCxG), heme-interacting (helix-C, WxxxR), oxygen-binding (helix-I, AGxxT), critical hydrogen bonding (helix-K, ExxR), the “PERF” motif (PxxFxPxRF) and microsomal import (a proline-glycine rich region following an initial string of about 20 hydrophobic N-terminal residues), and further demonstrate the similarity between the two enzymes (Fig. 2). In the case of Dmphm, the second methionine (M) residue is thought to start the protein sequence, as there are charged residues following the first such residue.

### 3.3. Phenotype of Dmphm mutants

Mutations in *phm* prevent full differentiation of the embryonic cuticle relative to wild type (Fig. 3F vs. A). Nevertheless, the early embryonic development of the Dmphm<sup>E7</sup> mutant appears normal until approximately stage 14 or 10:30–11:30 h after egg laying (Fig. 3B vs. G). At stages 15–16 (11:30–16:00 h) (Fig. 3C and D vs. H and I), abnormal morphogenetic movements become apparent which involve defects in dorsal closure, failure of head involution, and aberrant gut looping, a phenotype identical to that of *dib*, *sad* and *shd* mutants. As with these latter mutants, Dmphm mutants also lack significant IMP-E1 (a 20E-inducible gene) epidermal expression in stage 15 (11:30–13:30 h) embryos relative to wild type (Fig. 3E and J) (Chávez et al., 2000; Warren et al., 2002; Petryk et al., 2003), consistent with the hypothesis that the Dmphm gene is also involved in ecdysteroid synthesis. However, in embryos collected over 12 h and then allowed to develop for an additional 24 h prior to spectrin staining, normal germ band retraction was observed to occur in 299 out of 300 homozygous phantom embryos.

### 3.4. Characterization of enzymatic activity in S2 cells expressing Dmphm or Bmphm

Three days after transfection with Dmphm, Bmphm or GFP (control) expression plasmids, S2 cells were homogenized into medium containing the non-radiolabeled ecdysteroid precursor 2,22,25-trideoxyecdysone (3β,5β[H]-ketodiol) and incubated at room temperature for 6–8 h (Warren et al., 2002). The residue following the extraction of each preparation was subjected to sequential RP- and NP-chromatography employing UV analysis, followed by sequential LC-ESI/MS and <sup>1</sup>H-NMR structural analysis. A typical RP-HPLC result is shown in Fig. 4. Based on UV<sub>248 nm</sub> analysis, cells expressing DmPhm (Fig. 4A) or BmPhm (Fig. 4B) exhibited conversion of more than 25% (DmPhm), or 50% (BmPhm) of the precursor 3β,5β[H]-ketodiol substrate to the putative 2,22-dideoxyecdysone product, the 3β,5β[H]-ketotriol. The characteristic UV

Fig. 2. Alignment of *Drosophila* and *Bombyx phantom*. Alignment of the predicted sequences was achieved using the Clustal W program. Identical residues are bold against dark gray and similar residues are boxed. The black dots denote residues conserved also in *Drosophila dib*, *sad* and *shd*. Hyphens indicate gaps inserted for optimizing the alignment. The single base change in the *Drosophila phm$^{E7}$* mutant is indicated with an arrow. Conserved structural motifs common to most CYP enzymes are shown, i.e. a glycine-proline rich area following a string of about 20 N-terminal hydrophobic residues following the initial methionine residue (circled), helix-C (WxxxR), helix-I (AGxxT; a putative oxygen-binding pocket), helix-K (ExxR; a putative hydrogen binding sequence), “PERF” (PxxFxPExF) and the heme-binding region (PFxxGxRxCxG). Also shown is the position in the sequence of the phantom peptide used to elicit the anti-phantom antibody.

spectra of the products and the demonstration of their co-elution with the $^3$H-3β,5β[H]-ketotriol standard also suggested their identity as the 3β,5β[H]-ketotriol (data not shown). In otherwise identical incubations with GFP-expressing (control) cells, no metabolism of this substrate was observed.

The combined putative 3β,5β[H]-ketotriol products resulting from three or more such individual transfection reactions and RP-HPLC analyses were additionally purified by NP-HPTLC, and in each instance they co-eluted with the $^3$H-3β,5β[H]-ketotriol standard (data not shown). The pooled DmPhm and BmPhm products were then each subjected to LC-ESI/MS analysis (Fig. 5A and B). These MS spectra are essentially

identical as both show a prominent molecular $M + 1$ ion at 433 mass units (mu), consistent with the addition of a single hydroxyl group to the 3β,5β[H]-ketodiol substrate. In addition, characteristic ions resulting from the sequential elimination of two water molecules from the parent ion were observed at 415 and 397 mu in both spectra, again consistent with the presence of one additional hydroxyl function in the product.

While the composite data were strongly suggestive of product identity, the unequivocal characterization of these products necessitated high-field $^1$H-NMR product analysis. The specific spectral absorptions occurring between field strengths 0.6 and 1.2 ppm due to the isolated methyl group protons at C$_{18}$, C$_{19}$, C$_{21}$, C$_{26}$ and

C$_{27}$ in the substrate 3β,5β[H]-ketodiol are shown in Fig. 6A. The dotted line represents an integral indicating that the correct numbers of protons are in fact represented by these particular complex absorptions. They are compared to otherwise identical absorptions in the proposed 3β,5β[H]-ketotriol products resulting from the enzymatic action of either the DmPhm (Fig. 6B) or BmPhm (Fig. 6C) enzymes. It is clear that the two product spectra are basically identical. In addition, the primary difference between the substrate spectra and the two product spectra in this ppm range is a dramatic 0.3 ppm downfield shift in the absorptions of the six C$_{26,27}$ methyl group protons in both

Fig. 4. RP-HPLC analysis of 3β,5β[H]-ketotriol product (2,22-dideoxyecdysone) formation following the incubation of Dmphm (A) or Bmphm (B)-transfected S2 cells (solid lines) or GFP-expressing control cells (dashed lines) with the 3β,5β[H]-ketodiol substrate (2,22,25-trideoxyecdysone).

product spectra relative to these same absorptions in the substrate. Furthermore, the intricate spin-spin splitting pattern of the individual C$_{26,27}$ methyl proton absorptions in the substrate, i.e. two closely spaced doublets, are the result of perturbation by the immediately adjacent hydrogen nuclei attached at C$_{25}$. In contrast, both C$_{26,27}$ methyl absorptions of the products have collapsed into a singlet, indicative of the absence of this particular hydrogen. These shifts in both the position and appearance of these absorptions are exactly what would be expected by the sole addition of a hydroxyl group to the substrate at C$_{25}$, replacing the hydrogen nucleus. Both g-COSY and g-NOESY analyses of the product, more sensitive methods for determining the interaction of adjacent and near-by protons, completely affirm these assertions (data not shown). Indeed, these parts of the spectra in the substrate and products encompassing these five distinctive methyl group absorptions are practically identical to analogous absorptions in the spectra of the structurally-related E and 25dE standards (data not shown) (see

and 20-hydroxylation. In addition, all the intermediates between the substrate and product were also observed. That is, all products detected in prior transfection experiments with these genes, either singly or in various combinations (Warren et al., 2002; Petryk et al., 2003), namely the 3β,5β[H]-ketotriol, 22dE, 2dE and E were detected here (data not shown).

Additional proof of the identity of these products of DmPhm and BmPhm enzymatic activity was obtained when either of these unlabeled 3β,5β[H]-ketotriol products, along with standard tracer $^3$H-3β,5β[H]-ketotriol and NADPH, was incubated with homogenized day 7 fifth instar larval prothoracic glands from *Manduca*. These active glands are known to convert the 3β,5β-ketotriol to E (Grieneisen et al., 1991, 1993; Warren and Gilbert, 1996). Indeed, over 6–8 h, both substrate mixtures were converted by the glands in high yield into a mixture of both E and 2dE (as indicated by their specific UV$_{248\ \text{nm}}$ absorptions) in addition to their co-migrating radiolabeled counterparts, i.e. $^3$H-E and $^3$H-2dE. The specific activity of the substrates and the resulting products were also identical (data not shown).

Metabolism experiments with other ecdysteroid compounds in transfected S2 cells yielded potentially interesting information concerning the substrate specificity of these two analogous *phantom* enzymes. S2 cells transfected with *Dmphm* and *Bmphm* could also mediate the hydroxylation of two structural isomers of the 3β,5β[H]-ketodiol that are not normally found in insects. Based on similar chromatographic, UV absorption and MS data, the 3β,5α[H]-ketodiol and the 3α,5α[H]-ketodiol substrates were both efficiently hydroxylated to apparent ketotriol products by both CYP enzymes. Curiously, as was noted above for the “natural” 3β,5β[H]-ketodiol precursor substrate, the cells transfected with *Bmphm* exhibited a much higher level of hydroxylation activity with these substrates than did the S2 cells identically transfected with *Dmphm* (data not shown). Although not proven conclusively, one can hypothesize that these substrates are also being hydroxylated at C$_{25}$.

Other possible substrates for the 25-hydroxylase, such as 25-deoxyecdysone (25dE) and [$^3$H]-ponA ([${}^3$H]-25-deoxy-20-hydroxyecdysone), in addition to [${}^3$H]-cholesterol, were not metabolized by S2 cells transfected with either *Dmphm* or *Bmphm* genes. Neither were the synthetic ecdysteroid compounds containing just one additional hydroxyl function at either the C$_2$ or C$_{22}$ positions, or lacking one at C$_{14}$, i.e. 2β,3β,14α,5α[H]-ketotriol, 3β,14α,22(R),5β[H]-ketotriol or 2β,3β,14-deoxy,5β[H]-ketodiol, respectively (data not shown).

The products are the result of substrate metabolism by S2 cells transfected with either Dmphpm (B) or Bmphm (C). Note the portion of the spectra from 0.6 to 1.2 parts per million (ppm) showing the absorption of the isolated methyl group protons of carbons 18, 19, 21, 26 and 27. Integrals of selected C${}_{19,21}$ and C${}_{26,27}$ proton absorptions in the substrate are shown as a dotted line (A).

### 3.5. Wild type and Dmphpm${}^{E7}$ mutant embryonic ecdysteroid titers and compositions

During the period of maximum embryonic ecdysteroid biosynthesis in developing wild type embryos (4–8 h; Kraminsky et al., 1980; Maroy et al., 1988), the ecdysteroid titer of homozygous mutant Dmphpm${}^{E7}$ embryos was found to be below the level of detection (1.6 pg/mg) as measured by RIA with the H22 antibody. In contrast, the ecdysteroid titer in the co-sorted

Dmphpm${}^{E7}$ heterozygous embryos was 44.17 ± 9.76 pg/mg fresh weight, in the low end of the range observed in similarly staged populations of developing wild type embryos (54.28 ± 5.34 pg/mg).

When the remaining samples from the above titer determinations were subsequently analyzed by RP-HPLC and fractions subjected to RIA with both the H22 and SHO-3 antibodies, it was determined that the homozygous mutant Dmphpm${}^{E7}$ embryos contained no detectable 20E, E or its immediate precursor 2dE. An

analysis of the corresponding heterozygous $Dmphm^{E7}$ embryos, like that of the wild type embryos, showed the presence of significant amounts of 20E, E and 2dE, together with unidentified polar materials (data not shown), similar to what was reported previously (Maroy et al., 1988; Petryk et al., 2003).

### 3.6. Developmental expression of Dmphm

The first discernible embryonic in situ expression of $Dmphm$ occurs at the early (syncytial) blastoderm stage, i.e. stage 4, 1:20–2:10 h after egg laying (Fig. 7A), the same as was observed for both $dib$ (the gene encoding the 22-hydroxylase) and $sad$ (the gene encoding the 2-hydroxylase) (Warren et al., 2002). During cellularization of the blastoderm (stage 5, 2:10–2:50 h), characteristic stripes of $Dmphm$ expression appear (Fig. 7B), again like $dib$ and $sad$, such that by the time of germ-band extension (stages 8–10, 3:10–5:20 h), $Dmphm$ expression (like that of $dib$ and $sad$) remains localized in these segmented epidermal cells (Fig. 7C and D).

In situ expression of $Dmphm$ becomes undetectable, as does that of $dib$ and $sad$, at a time when the germ band undergoes retraction (stages 11–14, 5:20–10:20 h). However, by stage 15 (11:20–13:00 h), some expression of $Dmphm$ resumes in the primordium of the ring gland, so that by stage 17 (16:00 h), strong $Dmphm$ expression is again observed, but only in the ring gland (Fig. 7E), identical to the late embryonic expression pattern of both $dib$ and $sad$ (Warren et al., 2002). This specific localization continues throughout the larval instars, as shown for a late third instar whole larva (Fig. 7F).

A developmental analysis of the brain (Br)–ring gland complex, including the ventral ganglion (VG), around the time of the last larval–larval molt shows a pattern of $Dmphm$ expression identical to that of $dib$ and $sad$ during this period (Warren et al., 2002). That is, expression in the prothoracic gland cells of the ring gland (RG) is high at the end of the second instar (Fig. 7G), declines to a low level just after the molt to the third instar (Fig. 7H), but then rebounds later during the wandering stage (Fig. 7I), 6–8 h prior to pupariation. At higher

(G) $Dmphm$ expression in the ring gland (RG) and none in the brain (Br)–ring gland complex, including the ventral ganglia (VG), from a late second instar larva. (H) $Dmphm$ expression is absent from the ring gland of the brain–ring gland complex from an early (feeding-stage) third instar larva. (I) $Dmphm$ expression in the ring gland of the brain–ring gland complex from a late (wandering stage) third instar larva. (J) High magnification of the ring gland in G showing $Dmphm$ expression only in the prothoracic gland cells and not in the corpus allatum (CA) and corpus cardiacum (CC), noted by arrows. (L) $Dmphm$ expression in the follicle cells at stage 8 (top) or nurse cells at stage 10 (bottom) adult ovaries, respectively.

magnification one sees conclusively that the expression within the ring gland at these stages is restricted to the prothoracic gland cells of the ring gland (Fig. 7J). Expression is not apparent in the adjoining cells comprising the corpus allatum (CA) and corpus cardiacum (CC) (Fig. 7K, a higher magnification of Fig. 7I) (see Dai and Gilbert, 1991). Later, in adult female ovaries, Dmphm expression is observed in either the follicle or nurse cells, depending on the stage (Fig. 7L).

Semi-quantitative, RT-PCR analysis of Dmphm mRNA in various larval and adult *Drosophila* tissues basically confirms the in situ observations (Fig. 8A). That is, major Dmphm expression is observed in the late third instar larval ring gland, although a trace presence can be detected in other larval tissues, i.e., the brain and fat body. In the adult, the majority of Dmphm expression is restricted to the ovaries, but as in the larvae, traces are present in the head (H) and carcass (Ca) of both sexes.

Western blot analysis of the expression of the *Drosophila* phantom protein in selected late third instar larval tissues and whole adult males and females using a rabbit polyclonal antibody directed against a region of the predicted *Drosophila* phantom sequence (Fig. 2) is shown in Fig. 8B. By this method, the gene product was only observed in larval brain ring gland complexes and not in other larval tissues nor in adult flies.

Northern analysis of Dmphm expression in late second instar and early and late third instar *Drosophila* larvae (Fig. 8C) reveals a single transcript of the expected size (1.9 kb). Similar to what was observed with the in situ analysis of ring gland expression, expression is high at the end of the second instar, becomes quite low shortly after the molt to the third instar, but becomes prominent again by the onset of wandering later in the instar.

### 3.7. Developmental tissue expression of *Bombyx* phantom

The profile of Bmphm post-embryonic gene expression in the silkworm is quite similar to that of Dmphm at corresponding larval stages of *Drosophila* development. Data from QRT-PCR analysis revealed that Bmphm expression during late larval development is concentrated in the *Bombyx* prothoracic glands (PG) (Fig. 9). In addition, like Dmphm expression in the ring gland, prothoracic gland expression of Bmphm exhibits profound changes at the time of the last larval-larval molt. Expression is quite elevated at the time of head capsule slippage (HCS) at the end of the penultimate (fourth) instar, undergoes apparent down-regulation by day 2 of the last (fifth) larval instar, and then rises by the time of the initiation of cocoon spinning. Also,

![Figure 8](#fig8)

**Fig. 8.** Dmphm expression during *Drosophila* development. (A) RT-PCR analysis of Dmphm and rpL17 (control) expression in selected tissues from late (wandering-stage) third instar larvae and adult males and females. SG, salivary gland; FB, fat body; Gu, gut; Ep, epidermis; Ov, ovary; Ca, carcass; Te, testes. (B) Western blot analysis of DmPhm expression in late (wandering-stage) third instar larval *Drosophila* tissues, in adult males and females and in S2 cells transfected with either a GFP-control gene (−) or with the Dmphm gene (+). (C) Northern blot analysis of Dmphm (1.9 kb) and rpL17A (0.6 kb) (control) expression in late second instar (L2) and early (feeding-stage) and late (wandering-stage) third instar larvae (L3).

in *Drosophila*, using this very sensitive technique, significant but low *Bmphm* expression can be observed in the corpus cardiacum and corpus allatum (CC–CA), brain, fat body and several other tissues such as the midgut and salivary glands, depending on the stage.

Notably less sensitive than QRT-PCR techniques, northern analysis of *Bmphm* expression at the beginning of silk spinning on day 6 of the fifth instar also shows a prominent band at 1.8–1.9 kb, but only in the prothoracic glands (Fig. 9 insert).

A more detailed QRT-PCR analysis of *Bmphm* expression in the prothoracic glands during this same period, i.e. just before and after the last larval–larval molt, is shown in Fig. 10, together with the developmental hemolymph ecdysteroid titer. From a maximum at the time of head capsule slippage (HCS) at the end of the fourth instar, a dramatic reduction in the expression of *Bmphm* occurs over an eight-hour period, just as the ecdysteroid titer begins its decline prior to ecdysis. After a minimum is reached on day 2 of the fifth and final larval instar, *Bmphm* expression then increases dramatically about a week before the ecdysteroid titer peaks just prior to pupation.


### 3.8. Subcellular localization of Dmphm in S2 cells

Early biochemical studies of the 25-hydroxylation reaction in crude or semi-purified tissue preparations from a variety of insect species suggested strongly that the 25-hydroxylase was a microsomal enzyme ([Kappler et al., 1988; Grieneisen et al., 1993](https://doi.org/10.1016/0022-2836(88)90470-8)). To confirm the localization of DmPhm in S2 cells, they were co-transfected with *Dmphm* containing a C-terminal HA-epitope tag along with the mSpitz–GFP construct that specifically labels the ER ([Tsruya et al., 2002](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0092-8674(02)00826-6)). The localization of the HA-tagged Phm protein (Fig. 11B) was identical to that of the mSpitz–GFP marker (Fig. 11C), as indicated by their merged image (Fig. 11A), and not with either the DAPI nuclear stain (Fig. 11D) or the MitoTracker red stain (data not shown).


### 4. Discussion

The recent identification of *dib*, *sad* and *shd* as the *Drosophila* genes coding for the CYP enzymes that catalyze the sequential hydroxylation of ecdysteroid pre-

Fig. 10. Developmental expression of *Bombyx phantom* in the prothoracic gland. The Bmphm transcript level (normalized to *rp49*) in the prothoracic gland was analyzed individually by QRT-PCR (mean ± SE, $n = 3$). Primers QF2 and QR2 were used. The mean value at HCS in fourth instar larvae was set as 100%. The ecdysteroid level in the hemolymph is from Kiguchi and Agui (1981) and Kiguchi et al. (1985). SI, spiracle index was according to Kiguchi and Agui (1981); GP, gut purge.

cursors at the C₂₂-, C₂- and C₂₀-positions, respectively (Warren et al., 2002; Petryk et al., 2003; see Gilbert, 2004) (Fig. 1) was based on the cytogenetic analyses of 20 years ago that identified these mutants that failed to form a normal embryonic cuticle (Jürgens et al., 1984; Nüsslein-Volhard et al., 1984; Wieschaus et al., 1984). Later studies indicated that these Halloween mutants also failed to undergo normal head involution, did not show normal gut looping, and did not complete dorsal closure. In the case of *phantom* and with the utilization of the *Drosophila* genomic database, we have shown here that the Dmphm<sup>E7</sup> mutation is the result of a single base substitution, i.e. glutamine (Q<sup>286</sup>) was replaced with a stop codon, effectively truncating the message and thus producing a null mutation with the typical Halloween gene embryonic lethal phenotype.

Lacking such convenient and well-defined cytogenetics, mutants and complete genomic database, gene identification in *Bombyx* was more involved and laborious, although high throughput comparative techniques such as FDD did lead to specific gene identification. This success is due in large measure to the finding that some genes are expressed in only a very narrow range of tissues and undergo significant up-and/or down-regulation over the developmental period of interest. *Bombyx* steroidogenic CYP genes, analogous to the *Drosophila* Halloween genes, would be expected to show just such a preferential expression in the prothoracic glands. Also, like their *Drosophila* analogs, their expression should change dramatically throughout development, reflecting the repetitive surges of ecdysteroid biosynthesis that act to coordinate molting and metamorphosis of insects and other arthropods. Such a candidate *Bombyx* P450 gene fragment, PG04j, was observed in FDD experiments employing prothoracic gland mRNA representing numerous intervals throughout the fourth and fifth larval instars. The fragment, exhibiting a conserved heme binding domain, was not only specific to the prothoracic glands, but also underwent dramatic changes in expression in association with changes in the hemolymph ecdysteroid titer.

The characterization of both the Dmphm and Bmphm genes and gene products demonstrates that they encoded the ecdysteroid 25-hydroxylase of these two divergent species. This was established biochemically following the transfection of these genes into S2 cells. Three days following the transfection, the S2 cells gained the ability to hydroxylate the well-characterized ecdysteroid precursor 2,22,25-trideoxyecdysone (3β,5β[H]-ketodiol) in high yield to a product with the chromatographic profile, specific UV-absorption, exact molecular mass and MS-fragmentation pattern of 2,22-dideoxyecdysone (3β,5β[H]-ketotriol). While clearly indicative, these data do not prove unequivocally that the substrate was indeed attacked at the C₂₅-position by the expressed DmPhm and BmPhm hydroxylases, as there are several other susceptible positions for such oxidative attack on the sterol backbone.

proof that the product resulted from 25-hydroxylase activity was only achieved following NMR analysis of the respective products, wherein it was shown clearly that the additional hydroxyl group in the product was indeed at C₂₅.

When *phm* is mutated, one can postulate that the required ecdysteroid 25-hydroxylation activity during embryogenesis is absent, leading to a complete block in the biosynthesis of E, and therefore 20E. The endogenous ecdysteroid titer and composition in Dmphm<sup>E7</sup> embryos at about the time of the expected mid-embryonic ecdysteroid peak supports this hypothesis. The titer of these homozygous mutant embryos was below the level of detection of the RIA (<1.6 pg/mg fresh weight), while that of the heterozygous embryos approximated that of wild type embryos of the same age. Additional analysis by RP-HPLC/RIA demonstrated that these homozygous mutant embryos were devoid of 20E, E and 2dE, in contrast to the presence in high concentration of these ecdysteroids in both the heterozygous mutant and wild type embryos (see also Maroy et al., 1988; Petryk et al., 2003).

This result is supported by the phenotype of the mutant embryo, and ultimately by its death. However, in the homozygous *phm* embryos and in the other Halloween mutants, normal germ band retraction is observed. This is curious, as it has recently been reported that the expression of a dominant negative ecdysone receptor in *Drosophila* embryos leads to a large fraction of the embryos (>50%) exhibiting germ band retraction defects, as well as head involution and dorsal closure defects otherwise similar to those of the Halloween class (Kozlova and Thummel, 2003). While it remains a possibility that the so-called maternal

ecdysteroids thought to be bound to yolk proteins in the newly laid embryo (Bownes et al., 1988; Grau and Gutzeit, 1990) might subsequently act to coordinate germ band retraction some 10 h later in the *phm* mutants, this is in fact many hours after the observed endogenous peak of ecdysteroids due, in part, to Phantom action. Alternatively, it is possible that there is an as yet unidentified ligand for the ecdysone receptor that does not involve the action of Phantom or the other terminal hydroxylases.

Additional information concerning the specificity of the *Drosophila* and *Bombyx* 25-hydroxylase enzymes was obtained by incubating both the *Dmphm* and *Bmphm* transfected S2 cells with a variety of potential substrates lacking the C<sub>25</sub> hydroxyl function. It was determined that two steroids not described in insects and having the unusual “mammalian-like” planar 5α[H]-(trans)-A/B-ring junction and either an “active” 3β-or “inactive” 3α-hydroxyl group, in contrast to 20E which has a 3β[OH],5β[H] configuration, were efficiently hydroxylated by the *Drosophila* and *Bombyx* enzymes. These data are consistent with in vitro studies of the metabolism of these compounds by *Manduca* prothoracic glands (Bollenbacher et al., 1979). However, sterols with either too few hydroxyl groups, i.e. [³H]-cholesterol, or those with too many hydroxyl functions, i.e. 25dE or [³H]-ponA ([³H]-25-deoxy-20-hydroxyecdysone), or those closely related to the above ketodiol substrates, but prematurely hydroxylated at either the C<sub>2</sub>- or C<sub>22</sub>-positions or lacking the C<sub>14</sub> hydroxyl function, were not substrates for the reaction.

These data lend further support to the long-standing hypothesis that there is a preferred sequence to the terminal hydroxylation reactions of the 3β,5β[H]-ketodiol leading to E, i.e. first at C<sub>25</sub>, then C<sub>22</sub> and finally at C<sub>2</sub> (see Gilbert et al., 2002; Lafont et al., 2004). The secretory product of the lepidopteran PGs is 3-dehydroecdysone (Warren et al., 1988) and a 3-ketoreductase must first act in the hemolymph to reduce it to E (Sakurai et al., 1989), whereas in *Drosophila*, E is secreted by the ring glands (Redfern, 1984; Kiriishi et al., 1990). E then circulates to target tissues where it is converted to the principal molting hormone 20E by another P450 enzyme, i.e. ecdysone-20-monooxygenase (Shd), which is not present in the prothoracic or ring glands (Petryk et al., 2003). From studies of the *Drosophila phantom* mutant, it appears that the C<sub>22</sub>- and C<sub>2</sub>-hydroxylases (Dib and Sad, respectively) can only complex with a 25-hydroxylated substrate, i.e. the 3β,5β[H]-ketotriol. Otherwise, the resulting product of the sequential hydroxylation at C<sub>22</sub> and C<sub>2</sub> of the 3β,5β-ketodiol substrate, i.e. 25-deoxyecdysone, might be further metabolized by Shd (the 20-hydroxylase) to 20-hydroxy-25-deoxyecdysone, i.e. to ponasterone A (ponA). In *Drosophila* tissues (Deak et al., 1988), in cell lines derived from these tissues and in artificial reporter constructs involving the *Drosophila* ecdysteroid receptor complex (Baker et al., 2000; Henrich, 2004), ponA is about a 1000-fold more active than 20E in binding to, and activating, the ecdysteroid receptor. Thus, any such coordinated synthesis of ponA would presumably rescue the *phm*<sup>E7</sup> mutant! However, while a common ecdysteroid of crustaceans, along with E and 25dE (see Chang and Kaufman, 2004), ponA has not been detected in insects.

The observed expression patterns of the *Dmphm* gene throughout *Drosophila* development are consistent with its role in encoding the terminal 25-hydroxylase in the ecdysteroidogenic pathway leading to E. During early to mid-embryonic development, characterized by a peak of ecdysteroid biosynthesis (stages 8–12, 3:10–9:20 h), strong *Dmphm* expression, like that of *dib* and *sad*, is localized within segments of cells in the developing embryonic epidermis (Fig. 7C and D) (Chávez et al., 2000; Warren et al., 2002; Petryk et al., 2003). By this stage, *shd* expression, i.e. the gene encoding the 20-hydroxylase (monooxygenase), also becomes prominent in these cells (Petryk et al., 2003). Our composite studies indicate that the epidermis is the site of ecdysteroidogenesis during early embryonic development as it appears to be in some insects during post-embryonic development (Delbecque et al., 1990).

After initially fading away, *Dmphm*, along with *dib* and *sad*, becomes associated with the developing ring gland late in embryogenesis. This exclusive expression of *Dmphm* continues within the prothoracic gland cells of the larval ring gland, the source of E throughout the three larval instars. As was previously observed with *dib* and *sad*, the in situ expression of *Dmphm* also undergoes dramatic fluctuations at the time of the last larval–larval molt, being high at the end of the second larval instar, decreasing soon after the molt to the third instar, only to rise again by the onset of wandering at the end of the instar. Precisely this same developmental alteration is observed in analogous northern blots. Later, *Dmphm* expression in the adult female is mainly localized in the ovaries, another tissue known to be involved in the synthesis of ecdysteroids (Delbecque et al., 1990; see Raikhel et al., 2004), and can be observed in either the follicle cells (implicated in ecdysteroid biosynthesis) or the nurse cells, depending on the stage. This is similar to patterns observed with both *sad* and *shd* (Warren et al., 2002; Petryk et al., 2003). In contrast, *dib* is only expressed in the follicle cells (Chávez et al., 2000), but the reason is conjectural at best.

These patterns of tissue expression are supported by semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis of individual tissues during larval and adult *Drosophila* development. Using this sensitive technique, strong expression is observed in the larval ring gland and adult ovary, although faint expression can also be observed in the
larval brain and fat body and adult head and carcass from either sex. This supports the biochemical data of earlier studies using enzyme extracts indicating that the 25-hydroxylation reaction, while prominent in the prothoracic glands, can also be detected in several non-endocrine tissues in both *Calliphora* and *Locusta* (Meister et al., 1985, 1987; see Delbecque et al., 1990). Recent data from transgenic flies expressing GFP under the control of a putative *Dmphpm* gene promoter support these findings, as significant expression was observed not only in the larval and mid-pharate-adult prothoracic gland cells and adult ovarian follicle cells as expected, but also in a small subset of cells within the tissues of the abdominal muscle or epidermis during larval and pupal–adult development. Expression was also noted in the anterior trachea, the adult female fat body, the male testes and other tissues (M. O'Connor, unpublished data). However, western blots of various third instar larval *Drosophila* tissues and adult males and females shows that strong expression of the 25-hydroxylase is limited to the brain-ring gland complex.

The developmental expression of *Bmphm* observed during late larval development in *B. mori* is also consistent with its role in encoding the CYP 25-hydroxylase, and is comparable with the expression pattern of the *Dmphpm* gene noted above. That is, by ultra-sensitive QRT-PCR analysis, strong *Bmphm* expression was localized in the larval prothoracic glands, but was also detected in other tissues including the brain-retro-cerebral complex, the fat body, midgut and salivary glands. At present, there is no evidence that these other tissues are involved in the synthesis of E at any stage of insect development, but it is known that some mammalian steroidogenic CYP enzymes appear to have both secondary steroid and non-sterol substrates (Brown, 1998; Honkakoski and Negishi, 2000). Thus, the question of whether there may be other endocrine functions coordinated by *phantom* P450 expression analogous to those involving similar mammalian CYP enzymes catalyzing 25-hydroxylation reactions, i.e. in the formation of the oxysterol hormones (Lala et al., 1997) and vitamin D (Brown, 1998), remains a possibility.

Nevertheless, Halloween gene expression in both endocrine glands appears to be tightly regulated. In *Drosophila* ring glands, the in situ expression of *dib* (encodes the 22-hydroxylase) and *sad* (encodes the 2-hydroxylase) was shown to fluctuate dramatically at the time of the last larval-larval molt (Warren et al., 2002), and the same was shown for *Dmphpm*. Northern blot analysis of *Bmphm* gene expression in the *Bombyx* prothoracic glands reveals a prominent band of the predicted size, about 1.8–1.9 kb, and by QRT-PCR analysis, the tissue-specific expression of this 25-hydroxylase gene is also shown to undergo sharp changes at

the time of the last larval-larval molt. A more detailed analysis of *Bmphm* expression in the prothoracic glands demonstrated that maximum gene expression is observed during head capsule slippage (HCS) at the end of the penultimate (fourth) larval instar, coincident with the peak in the hemolymph ecdysteroid titer occurring at this time. However, 13 h later, by which time the ecdysteroid titer has fallen back to a basal level, *Bmphm* expression has decreased to less than 10% of its peak values and does not rise again until well into the final (fifth) larval instar.

Most of the periodic increases in the titer of molting hormone, as least in lepidopterans, are known to involve the acute action of the neuropeptide prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH) (see Rybczynski, 2004), ultimately perhaps by regulating a rate-limiting early step in E biosynthesis (Warren and Gilbert, 1996; Gilbert et al., 2002). In addition, it has been suggested recently that one of the early ecdysone response genes, the orphan nuclear receptor E75A, may act as a feed-forward factor in ecdysteroidogenesis by up-regulating the transcription of genes that encode critical enzymes in the ecdysteroid biosynthetic pathway, including the Halloween genes (Bialecki et al., 2002). However, while periodic increases in the expression of both *Dmphpm* and *Bmphm*, along with *dib* and *sad*, are indeed observed in both species, they do not always correspond temporally with increases in the ecdysteroid titer.

Nevertheless, there does appear to be a strong temporal correlation between the down-regulation of the expression of these genes and the rapid reduction in the titer both during embryogenesis in *Drosophila* and at the time of the last larval-larval molt in both species (Maroy et al., 1980; see Bialecki et al., 2002; Sullivan and Thummel, 2003). Increased synthesis of E clearly plays a central role in titer upswings (Gilbert et al., 2002; Petryk et al., 2003), but the regulation of the rapid decline in the ecdysteroid titer throughout development is conjectural. Yet, in coordinating developmental events, a definitive decrease in the ecdysteroid titer is known to be just as important as an equally rapid surge in the titer (Schwartz and Truman, 1983). In this respect, the feedback inhibition of 20E on the biosynthetic CYP enzymes involved in E synthesis may play a role (see Gilbert et al., 2002; Lafont et al., 2004; Sakurai, 2004) and could involve the ecdysteroid receptor complex in the prothoracic gland (see Gilbert et al., 1997; Henrich, 2004). Thus, the down-regulation of the expression of *Bmphm*, *Dmphpm* and other *Cyp* Halloween genes could be controlled by one or more other ecdysone-responsive nuclear transcription factors analogous to those that coordinate mammalian steroid hormone biosynthesis (Honkakoski and Negishi, 2000). Based on their temporal profiles, DHR3, DHR4 and
βFTZ-F1 are likely candidates (Sullivan and Thummel, 2003).

Finally, following their transfection into S2 cells, HA-tagged versions of *sad*, *dib* and *shd* were all found to co-localize in the mitochondria with a specific mitochondrial domain marker (Warren et al., 2002; Petryk et al., 2003). These direct molecular demonstrations of the mitochondrial association of these CYP enzymes were generally consistent with prior biochemical metabolism studies, which involved density gradient fractionation of subcellular organelles from endocrine tissues of various insects and their subsequent in vitro incubation with various radiolabeled ecdysteroid precursors (Kappler et al., 1988; Grieneisen et al., 1993). Confocal microscopic examination of the tagged 25-hydroxylase indicated a microsomal localization for this P450 enzyme. Following transfection of S2 cells with a HA-tagged version of the *Dmphm* gene, co-localization with the mSpitz-GFP ER marker was observed. The data are consistent with the prior biochemical studies and the N-terminal sequence of both DmPhm and BmPhm which, together with a glycine-proline rich region, exhibit a typical hydrophobic string of amino acids that are thought to help anchor the cytochrome to the microsomal membrane (see Feyer-eisen, 2004).

Since the Diptera and Lepidoptera are not closely related, but likely use a very similar biosynthetic scheme for 20E synthesis, one can speculate that the four terminal hydroxylation steps now characterized in the fruit fly will also be found in *Bombyx* and other insects as well, and perhaps in all arthropods. The basic questions that now remain concern the regulation of the CYP enzymes already characterized, in addition to the identification and regulation of those enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of the 3β,5β[H]-ketodiol from cholesterol via 7-dehydrocholesterol (7dC) and particularly, in the subsequent and likely rate-limiting oxidation of 7dC, i.e. the “Black Box” (see Gilbert et al., 2002; Lafont et al., in press).
