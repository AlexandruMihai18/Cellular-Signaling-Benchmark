- Keywords: Alzheimer disease, ER calcium overload, nSOCE.

Abstract:

Significance: Calcium (Ca²⁺) hypothesis of Alzheimer disease (AD) gains popularity. It points to new signaling pathways that may underlie AD pathogenesis. Based on calcium hypothesis novel targets for the development of potential AD therapies are identified.

Recent Advances: Recently the key role of neuronal store-operated calcium entry (nSOCE) in the development of AD has been described. Correct regulation of nSOCE is necessary for the stability of postsynaptic contacts to preserve the memory formation. Molecular identity of hippocampal nSOCE is defined. Perspective nSOCE-activating molecule, prototype of future anti-AD drugs, is described.

Critical issues: Endoplasmic reticulum Ca²⁺ overload happens in many but not in all AD models. The nSOCE targeting therapy described in the current review may not be universally applicable.

Future Directions: There is a need to determine whether AD is a syndrome with one critical signaling pathway that initiates pathology or it is a disorder with many different signaling pathways that are disrupted simultaneously or one after each other. It is necessary to validate applicability of nSOCE-activating therapy for the development of anti-AD medication. There is an experimental correlation between downregulated nSOCE and disrupted postsynaptic contacts in AD mouse models. Signaling mechanisms downstream of nSOCE which are responsible for the regulation of stability of postsynaptic contacts has to be discovered. That will bring new targets for the development of AD preventing therapies.

- Introduction

Alzheimer disease (AD) is the age-related brain disorder that causes progressive neurodegeneration predominantly in the cortical and hippocampal brain regions. The major hallmarks of AD are the progressive impairment of memory storage and accumulation of fibrillary amyloid plaques in patient's brains. AD has two forms: sporadic AD (SAD) with currently unknown reasons for emergence and familial AD (FAD) caused by genetically inherited mutations either in amyloid precursor protein (APP) or presenilin 1 (PS1) or presenilin 2 (PS2) proteins (12, 49, 50, 59). The main risk factor for AD is the advanced age. First symptoms of FAD start to appear in patients around 50 years old. This is in contrast to SAD cases, which emerge in much older age, around 70 and later. FAD is a small portion of total AD cases - approximately 1-2%. Information about FAD-causing mutations is used for generation of transgenic animal models of AD. Since manifestation of SAD and FAD are similar, there is hope that successful treatment of FAD may lead to SAD-relevant therapeutics. Future investigations and clinical trials will shed the light on this question.

There are many hypotheses of AD pathogenesis: the oldest one is the cholinergic hypothesis (11), the dominant one is the amyloidogenic hypothesis (51) and also popular is the tau hypothesis (67). Recently amyloidogenic hypothesis has been transformed to the oligomer hypothesis or soluble Aβ hypothesis (41). It differs from the classical amyloid hypothesis by positing that the proximal neurotoxins in AD are soluble oligomers of Aβ, rather than Aβ in the form of amyloid aggregates. However, so far none of these hypotheses has brought successful drugs to prevent the AD pathogenesis. Recently calcium hypothesis of AD started to gain popularity. It states that calcium signaling mishandling in neurons occurs at early disease stages is the a key event triggering synaptic dysfunction and neurodegeneration (1). Development of new powerful and precise calcium imaging techniques enabled extensive research in this field and new intriguing data recently appeared. Current review is devoted to description of calcium signaling pathways disrupted during AD with particular emphasis on ER calcium channels and store-operated calcium entry. Based on the calcium hypothesis novel targets for the

development of AD-preventing therapies are suggested and their applicability to the treatment of AD cases is discussed.

### Ca²⁺ hypothesis of Alzheimer disease

The calcium hypothesis of brain aging was first formulated in 1982. In 1989 and 2017, the hypothesis was revised to introduce new data and outline questions which needed to be answered in the future (1, 63). Calcium hypothesis of AD is connected with other hypothesis in the field since changes in calcium signaling are likely to be secondary to deleterious actions of Aβ oligomers in neurons, disruption of presenilin functions, defects in mitochondria dysfunction and aging-related changes. There is a growing body of evidence that dysregulation in signaling pathways that handle calcium (Ca²⁺) play a major role in the initiation of AD pathogenesis. Ca²⁺ is a second messenger that is involved in many if not all cellular processes of neuronal life. Calcium can enter the neuron from extracellular space via membrane embedded Ca²⁺ permeable channels. Among them are voltage-gated Ca²⁺ channels (VGCC), non-specific cation channels N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDAR) and transient receptor potential channels (TRPC). Neurons have intracellular Ca²⁺ stores such as endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria. Ca²⁺ can be released from ER via inositol trisphosphate receptor (InsP₃R) and ryanodine receptors (RyanR) (14). Mitochondria can shape intracellular calcium signaling, mainly via Ca²⁺ sequestering mechanism (97). Ca²⁺ uptake into mitochondria plays an important role in neuronal physiology by stimulating mitochondrial metabolism and increasing mitochondrial energy production. Excessive Ca²⁺ entry into mitochondria can lead to opening of a permeability transition pore (PTP) and may lead to apoptosis (111). How these calcium entry pathways affected during AD will be discussed later.

First symptoms of Alzheimer disease start to appear in patients that 70 to 80 years old for sporadic AD. For genetically inherited familiar form of AD first symptoms may appear already at 50 years of age. The human brain has protective mechanisms that fight with the disease until middle age or later. However, with age the capacitance of such mechanisms gets lower and at the certain moment brain is not able to resist AD anymore. Loss of ability to handle Ca²⁺ is one of the features of aging neurons. In AD experimental models Ca²⁺ is accumulated inside of neurons and intracellular Ca²⁺ concentration is

increased (1, 15). Elevated calcium levels appear to be toxic to cells and trigger subsequent pathological processes, which drive AD pathogenesis. What are the reasons for the increase of Ca²⁺ in AD? Is there a main Ca²⁺ handling mechanism that is dysregulated in AD or it is a consequence of events that lead to development of the AD? Are there any therapeutic agents that can normalize Ca²⁺ signaling system in AD? Calcium hypothesis of AD is aimed at answering these and many other related questions.

Familial forms of AD are caused by mutations in genes encoding APP, PS1 and PS2 proteins. For a long time beta-amyloid, the product of proteolytic cleavage of APP, has been considered the initial molecule that triggers AD. While there is a debate on whether the beta-amyloid is a major toxic culprit in AD (55, 80), it plays a major role in the pathogenesis of AD and in calcium dysregulation as well. Other AD-related proteins are presenilins (PS), which form the catalytic subunit of gamma-secretase. In amyloidogenic pathway (Figure 1) gamma-secretase is responsible for cleavage of APP at its transmembrane domain and produces toxic beta-amyloid (60). In addition to gamma-secretase function PS1 also plays the function of passive Ca²⁺ leak channel (84, 121), which is disrupted by many but not all FAD associated mutations in PS1. The influence of mentioned proteins on Ca²⁺ signaling pathways during AD pathology is discussed below.

- Beta-amyloid and neuronal calcium signaling

Beta-amyloid (Aβ) was initially recognized as the main toxic agent in AD (103). Currently beta-amyloid theory is under revision (55, 80). It is apparent that beta-amyloid plays an important role in AD pathogenesis but some other factors also contribute to AD pathology together with beta-amyloid or may even precede the beta-amyloid toxicity. Detrimental effect of Aβ oligomers on neurons has been extensively studied and many publications demonstrated that Aβ aggregates promote the increase in neuronal cytosolic Ca²⁺ concentration (16, 34-37, 46, 68, 107, 124). The exact mechanism of Aβ-mediated disruption of Ca²⁺ homeostasis is under active investigations. Concerning the role of beta-amyloid in Ca²⁺ dyshomeostasis during AD, it has been observed that beta-amyloid can make Ca²⁺ permeable channels in plasma membrane by themselves (7) (Figure 2). Probably the most important beta-amyloid target are NMDA receptors. Activation of NMDA receptors is a key event in long-term potentiation phenomenon, which thought to
be the cellular basis of memory formation process. The effects of beta-amyloid on NMDA receptors were extensively studied (43, 81, 134). Particularly, it has been shown that beta-amyloid is able to increase the vulnerability of neurons to excitotoxicity, which caused by excessive NMDAR receptor activation with subsequent cell calcium overload (77, 78). Some data indicate that beta-amyloid in its oligomeric form may directly bind and modulate activity of NMDA receptors (30, 69, 108, 117). There is indication that NMDARs are required for synaptic targeting of Aβ oligomers but they do not appear to comprise the actual binding sites for Aβ oligomers (32). Various deleterious effects of Aβ on NMDAR were reported. It was reported than in early disease stages Aβ activates NMDAR and induce rapid Ca²⁺ elevation in neurons (40, 87, 99, 134). Usage of Aβ oligomers at sublethal concentrations induces prolonged Ca²⁺ signaling via NMDAR. These Ca²⁺ signals trigger redox-sensitive stimulation of RyanR-mediated Ca²⁺ release from the ER, decreased RyanR 2 protein expression, mitochondrial fragmentation, and prevented RyanR-mediated spine remodeling (90). Detrimental effect of oligomeric Aβ on RyanR-mediated Ca2+ signaling in ER was also observed in glia, particularly in cultured astrocytes (2). In the study performed by Gavello and colleagues the oligomeric Aβ42 differently regulated RyanR, NMDAR and VGCCs by increasing Ca²⁺ release through RyRs and inhibiting Ca²⁺ influx through NMDARs and VGCCs. According to this study the overall increased intracellular Ca²⁺ concentration caused stimulation of K+ current carried by big conductance Ca²⁺-activated potassium (BK) channels and inhibition of hippocampal network firing (44). Application of oligomeric Aβ species in vivo causes fast rise in resting Ca²⁺ levels which depend on NMDARs activation and triggers dendritic spines loss (6). Treatment with aducanumab (anti Aβ antibody) restores calcium homeostasis in Tg 2576 mice (61). The treatment effect was connected to restoration of NMDAR function rather than to restoration of intracellular Ca²⁺ signaling. Additionally it was reported that Aβ induces reduction in NMDAR expression and enhances its endocytosis (109), impairs NMDARs-dependent LTP (29) and reduces NMDAR-mediated calcium influx into active spines (104). Another calcium-permeable plasma membrane channels are presynaptic VGCC. It has been observed that Aβ oligomers decrease synaptic transmission between hippocampal neurons, most likely via depression of Ca²⁺ flux through P/Q-type calcium channels (85). However, in HEK 293 cells that overexpress recombinant P/Q-type calcium
channels the increase in P/Q-type currents by Aβ oligomers has been observed (54).

Authors explain such differences by the fact that ion channels can be bidirectionally regulated by the same molecule. For example, potassium channel blocker k-conotoxin PVIIA, both enhances and reduces potassium currents depending on its activation state (65). On the other hand, the authors report that block of postsynaptic L-type calcium channels by 10 uM nimodipine did not reverse Aβ42-induced deficits, indicating that Aβ oligomer pathology is specifically mediated via presynaptic ion channels. In contrast to results mentioned above, there are data on age-dependent upregulation of L-type VGCC currents in CA1 region of hippocampus in 3xTgAD mice (125). It was reported that antagonists of L-VGCC can protect neurons and preserve synaptic function in animal models of aging and AD (5, 73, 88, 98, 122)

Besides actions of beta-amyloid on the plasma membrane-embedded calcium channels, it was shown that both extracellular and intracellular beta-amyloid application alters activity of ER-resident calcium channels - RyanR and InsP₃R (42, 57). RyanR- and InsP₃R-mediated Ca²⁺ responses were induced by application of Aβ(25-35) and Aβ40 on cultured cortical neurons. It was shown that Aβ42-induced Ca²⁺ release from the ER in intact human neuroblastoma cells was just partially mediated by InsP₃R, while the greater part of Ca²⁺ elevation was induced due to an alternative mechanism (57). Interestingly, it was reported that lowering of RyanR-mediated Ca²⁺ release leads to the reduction of both intracellular and extracellular Aβ load in APP(swe)-expressing (Tg2576) mice (86).

According to Stutzmann et al, it is an example of proposed pathogenic feed-forward cycle in which elevated Ca²⁺ levels triggered by beta-amyloid further facilitate production of Aβ (17). The link between extracellular Aβ and intracellular channels is still elusive, but several possible mechanisms of action have been proposed. It was shown that Aβ oligomers induce InsP₃ production through stimulation and dimerization of synaptic mGluR5 receptors (96). Another possible link is that in dendritic spines Ca²⁺ release by RyanR can be triggered by Aβ-facilitated Ca²⁺ influx through NMDARs (17, 45, 89). Studies performed by San Martin and colleagues demonstrated that Aβ oligomers promote RyanR2-mediated Ca²⁺ release, mitochondrial Ca²⁺ entry, ROS generation and fragmentation of the mitochondrial structural network. It was further shown that RyanR2 knockdown as well as usage of antioxidants reduces Ca²⁺-mediated noxious effects of Aβ

oligomers on mitochondrial function (101, 102). Some AD models demonstrated intracellular Aβ accumulation, which may also take part in ER calcium signaling destabilization (75). Intracellular application of Aβ oligomers into Xenopus oocytes stimulates G-protein-mediated InsP₃ production and consequent cytotoxic Ca²⁺ release from the ERs (35). Another study demonstrated that InsP₃Rs were not required for Aβ42-stimulated Ca²⁺ release from ER in DT40 chicken B-lymphocyte line permeabilized cells, revealing an additional direct effect of Aβ42 upon the ER (57).

- **Role of presenilins in Ca²⁺ homeostasis**

Presenilins act as a catalytic subunit of gamma secretase. FAD-associated mutations disrupt gamma secretase function, leading to amyloidogenic processing of APP and production of toxic beta amyloid species (Figure 1) (60). Whether FAD mutations cause gain of function or loss of gamma secretase function is the subject of debate (123, 127, 128). Development of gamma secretase modulators as potential anti-AD therapeutics is complicated due to essential role of gamma secretase in Notch processing (31). Calcium signaling effects of Aβ were discussed above. APP intracellular domain (AICD) also affects ER Ca²⁺ release by regulating the expression of genes involved in Ca²⁺ homeostasis (71).

Significant body of research suggests that AD-bearing PS mutants cause Ca²⁺ dysregulation independently of its gamma-secretase function and beta-amyloid accumulation and due to changes in activity of RyanR and InsP₃R (17, 25, 39, 93). Up-regulation of RyanR-mediated Ca²⁺ release and increased levels of RyanR expression among different presenilin-mutation bearing AD models was reported (17, 22, 23, 26, 33, 45, 113). It was proposed that presenilins alter RyanR gating thorough direct protein-protein interaction mediated by N-terminal cytosolic domain of presenilins (52, 91, 100). RyanR gating effects of PS1 and PS2 are isoform-specific (91). Increase of the PS2 to PS1 ratio was reported for normal aging mice in both cerebellum and forebrain, which correlates to loss of spatial memory, learning and motor function (58). Such homologue misbalance is proposed to contribute to age-dependent cytosolic Ca²⁺ level increase (17). Based on these findings it was proposed that excessive Ca²⁺ release from ER and elevated cytosolic Ca²⁺ concentrations observed during AD may be a result of altered

RyanR interaction with presenilins (91). Changes in RyanR function have been suggested

to be responsible for alterations in synaptic activity induced by presenilins (126).

Sensitivity of InsP₃R to its agonist InsP₃ significantly increased in cell expressing mutant presenilins (27, 28). Suppression of InsP₃R expression normalized exaggerated Ca²⁺ signals observed in cortical and hippocampal neurons in PS1-M146V knock-in and 3xTg AD mice models, indicating that it might be a potential therapeutic strategy (106). Recent research using data-based computational modeling provided deeper insight into InsP₃R gating in the presence of mutated presenilins (76). This model predicted that that the gain-of-function enhancement is sensitive to both InsP₃ and Ca²⁺ and that very small amount of InsP₃ is required to stimulate InsP₃R channels in the presence of FAD-causing mutant PS. Therefore, significant activity of the InsP₃R at resting InsP₃ concentration should lead to spontaneous Ca²⁺ signals in cells (76). Using computational model, the same research group suggested that mutation in presenilins increase the open probability of mitochondrial permeability transition pore, which in turn trigger pathological processes and may induce cell death (119). It was proposed that mutated presenilin enhance Ca²⁺ release through InsP₃R into a cytoplasmic microdomain formed by neighboring cluster of a few InsP₃R channels and MCU, and therefore facilitate mitochondrial calcium uptake (119). This investigation proposes direct link between Ca²⁺ disruptions and impaired mitochondrial function, as observed in AD.

Additional gamma secretase-independent function of presenilins was suggested. Presenilin 1 and presenilin 2 were reported to act as passive ER calcium leak channels (84, 121, 131). This idea was initially controversial (105) but it was supported by unbiased screen for ER Ca²⁺ leak channels (10). This function of PS1 is altered by many but not all FAD-associated mutations. For example, extensively studied M146V mutation is a classic example of PS1 mutation that causes disruption of Ca²⁺ leak function (121). However, widely distributed among Finnish population mutation when complete Exon 9 is deleted is the example of mutation that makes ER Ca²⁺ pore super leaky (121). A correlation between patient clinical phenotypes and effects of FAD mutations on ER Ca²⁺ leak function was observed (82). Site-directed mutagenesis approach was used to map potential ion conduction pore of PS1 (83). It was demonstrated that D385 but not D257 residue is important for channel function of presenilins (83, 121). Interestingly, presenilins share
the fold with chloride channels (118) and the high resolution crystal structure of archaeal

presenilin homologue PSH1 has a hole that traverses through the entire protein and is

large enough to allow passage of Ca²⁺ ions (74). This hole was however not apparent when

structure of γ-secretase complex was solved (9). Proteolytically cleaved presenilin does

not form ER Ca²⁺ leak channels (121), which may explain lack of obvious ion conduction

pathway in mature γ-secretase complex.

Using molecular dynamics approach a dynamic all-atom model of mature PS1

embedded to the membrane has been published recently (110). Important to note that

PS1 undergoes posttranslational modifications, particularly, auto-endoproteolysis. As

many other posttranslational modifications, auto-proteolysis is suggested to be essential

for the change of PS1 from inactive to active state (110). Authors have confirmed

previously published gating mechanism for PS1 (64). In agreement with previously

published data they have observed that Exon 9 plays a role of a “plug” that closes or open

the “doors” to the catalytic pocket of the PS1 depending on the activation state. Although

not modeled in this paper, these data suggest that deletion of Exon 9 permanently opens

the interior chamber of PS1, consistent with super leaky pore phenotype of PS1ΔE9

mutant (121).

In conclusion, mutations in presenilins is shown to enhance calcium release via both

ER-resident channels-RyanR and InsP₃R. In addition, presenilins themselves play a role of

ER Ca²⁺ leak channels. Excessive Ca²⁺ release from ER contributes to AD pathology.

Modifying Ca²⁺ release from ER is a promising therapeutic strategy in order to reduce toxic

cytosolic calcium elevations.

## ER calcium overload in AD hippocampal neurons

ER Ca²⁺ concentration is increased in experimental models of AD including transgenic

mice. It has been observed that InsP₃-evoked calcium release from the ER is upregulated

in PC12 cells and in fibroblasts that express mutant PS1 (48, 70). Similar effects were

observed in neurons in brain slices taken from mutant PS1-M146V, 3xTgAD

and

APPsweTauP301L mice (112-114). Stutzmann and colleagues suggest that enhanced Ca²⁺

release from the ER observed in these studies occurs due upregulated of RyanR function.

Another possible mechanism responsible for these effects is that mutations in PS1 disrupt
its function as ER calcium leak channel. In addition, it has been suggested that presenilins may potentiate the activity of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca²⁺-ATPase (SERCA) pump via direct protein-protein interactions (46). Beta-amyloid can indirectly increase ER calcium content. As discussed above, beta-amyloid potentiates Ca²⁺ entry via plasma membrane channels. Beta amyloid can also act on SERCA pump that sequesters cytosolic Ca²⁺ (Figure 3). To compensate the ER Ca²⁺ overload neurons may upregulate the calcium induced Ca²⁺ release from the ER via RyanR. Indeed, changes in expression of RyanR have been described in human AD cases and in patients with mild cognitive impairment (18, 62).

It is important to note that there are three subtypes of RyanR—1, 2, and 3. RyanR 2 and 3 subtypes are expressed in the brain. It has been observed that RyanR 2 is upregulated at early stages and is downregulated in advanced stages of AD in human postmortem samples (18, 62). Concerning RyanR 3 subtype, it has been observed that its protein (90) and mRNA expression (18) is upregulated in late stages of the disease, suggesting that upregulation of RyanR 3 might be a compensatory response to decreased function of RyanR 2. Increase in RyanR 2 expression and enhanced Ca²⁺ release have been reported in presymptomatic AD mice (21, 62, 113, 131). It has been shown that muscle relaxant dantrolene that targets RyanR exerts neuroprotective effects in mouse models of AD (24, 86, 92). Disadvantage of usage of dantrolene in treatment of AD is that it doesn't have specificity to neuronal type of RyanR and may lead to side-effects. Moreover, there are data that long-term treatment with dantrolene can worsen AD pathology (131).

- nSOCE is a potential therapeutic target

Neuronal store-operated calcium entry (nSOCE) is a unique mechanism that refills ER calcium stores in response to its depletion (95). For a long time, it has been believed that SOCE exists only in non-excitable cells where it is the main mechanism to refill intracellular stores (79). However, there is a growing body of evidence that SOCE exists in neurons (8, 13, 47, 66, 94, 115, 129, 130). nSOCE is composed of two parts. The first one is plasma membrane proteins from Orai and TRPC families that are able to make calcium permeable channels. Second one is ER membrane protein that have calcium-sensitive domain inside of the ER. There are two ER proteins that participate in functioning of SOCE: STIM1 and STIM2. STIM2 is predominantly expressed in hippocampus (115, 132). When calcium concentration drops inside of the ER, calcium-sensitive domain sends signal to the STIM to
oligomerize. When it is in oligomerized form, it goes to ER-plasma membrane junctions to bind ORAI and TRPC proteins in order to form nSOCE channels (Figure 4) (132).

Recently cellular nSOCE-dependent signaling pathway has been described in hippocampal neurons (115). It has been shown that neurons downregulate STIM2 expression in response to ER Ca²⁺ overload, resulting in drop in the amount of Ca²⁺ ions that enter neurons via nSOCE channels. STIM2 is downregulated in cultured hippocampal neurons and in hippocampus in animal models of AD, as well as in human AD brain samples (94, 115, 133). Cleavage of STIM proteins by presenilins was suggested as a potential mechanism involved in these effects (120). nSOCE channels constitute ternary complex made by STIM2 at the ER part and ORAI2 and TRPC6 at the plasma membrane part (132) (Figure 4). In other studies a role of Orai1 in supporting SOCE in hippocampal and cortical neurons was demonstrated (47, 66). Knockdown of TRPC6 expression abolished nSOCE in hippocampal neurons. Overexpressed TRPC6 or pharmacological activators of TRPC6 channels restored nSOCE and spine loss in AD neurons (132). The mice that overexpress TRPC6 in the brain display enhanced cognitive performance and increased formation of excitatory synapses (135).

What is a physiological role of nSOCE in hippocampal neurons? It has been shown that nSOCE participates in regulation of stability of mature mushroom spines (Figure 5) (94, 115, 133). Mushroom spines are site of strong synapses that are necessary for formation and storage of memories. It has been proposed that downstream target for nSOCE is pCaMKII, molecule that participates in long-term potentiation (LTP) (Figure 4). LTP is the best studied physiological mechanism of making participating synapses stronger and is essential for preservation of memories. It has been suggested that nSOCE is active in resting neurons (115) and is the main supplier of Ca²⁺ ions for CaMKII at rest. CaMKII is necessary for LTP performance. Shifting a balance from CaMKII to CaN is detrimental to synapses, leading to their instability and consequently causing memory dysfunction (93).

From this discussion TRPC6 appears to be an attractive target for development of AD preventing therapies. There are 2 molecules that are able to activate TRPC6 channels—hyperforin and NSN 21778 (Figure 6) (132). Hyperforin is a natural compound that activates TRPC6 channels (72). Beneficial effects of hyperforin and its derivatives inanimal models of AD have been demonstrated (20, 38, 56) In double transgenic
APPswe/PSEN1DE9 mice, derivative of hyperforin-tetrahydrohyperforin improves
memory and prevents the impairment of synaptic plasticity in a dose-dependent manner,
inducing a recovery of long-term potentiation (56). It has been also reported that
tetrahydrohyperforin is able to enhance autophagic clearance of APP (19). In hippocampal
neurons TRPC6-dependent downstream signaling was connected with activation of the
RAS/MEK/ERK, PI3K, and CAMKIV pathways (53, 116).
NSN 21778 compound was recently discovered as a positive modulator of nSOC
(132). Important to note that NSN 211778 is different from hyperforin in the mechanism of
TRPC6 activation. As it has been shown that hyperforin is a direct activator of TRPC6 while
NSN facilitates OAG induced Ca²⁺ influx through TRPC6 channels in conditions of partially
depleted intracellular stores (132). The neuroprotective mechanism of NSN that currently
proposed is that NSN activates TRPC6 channels in DAG-dependent manner. Following
activation of TRPC6 channels, Ca²⁺ enters spines and activates CaMKII. All these events
lead to spine and memory preservation and protection from the AD (132) (Figure 6).
Future studies will be needed to establish utility of NSN 21778 and its derivatives for
treatment of AD.
- Conclusions
Calcium hypothesis of AD is gaining popularity (4) since it points to new intracellular
signaling pathways that are dysregulated in neurons and more importantly it brings new
targets for the development of AD preventing therapies. Alzheimer disease is a
multifactorial brain disorder (3) that manifests itself as a loss of memory. Modern
therapeutical interventions should be based on understanding the mechanisms of memory
loss in AD. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that Ca²⁺ signaling dysregulation plays an
important role in synaptic pathology in AD. We propose that downregulation of nSOCE is
one of the mechanisms responsible for synaptic and memory loss in AD and that activators
of TRPC6 channels should exert beneficial effect in AD. Future studies will be need to test
these ideas.

Figure 1. Two pathways mediate APP processing in neurons.

APP is processed by α-, β-, and γ-secretases. In non-amyloidogenic pathway α-secretase cleaves APP first, leading to the production of soluble APP fragment (sAPPα), P3 and APP intracellular domain (AICD). Although role of P3 is not precisely studied, sAPPα and AICD play physiological roles in neurons (80). In amyloidogenic pathway β-secretase cleaves APP first, producing soluble extracellular fragment of APP (sAPPβ) and transmembrane C-terminal fragment of APP (APP-CTF). This APP-CTF is further cleaved by γ-secretases to produce beta-amyloid (Aβ) and AICD.

Figure 2. Beta-amyloid mediated increase of cytosolic Ca2+ concentration.

Beta-amyloid has several interaction partners on the plasma membrane (PM). Among them are NMDAR, VGCC, and mGluR5. Interaction with NMDAR and VGCC leads to influx of Ca2+ ions from extracellular space. Interaction with mGluR5 or other G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) leads to production of IP3 that potentiates the release of Ca²⁺ via IP3R from the ER to the cytosol. Moreover, beta-amyloid is able to make Ca²⁺-permeable channels in PM by itself. Increase in the ER Ca²⁺ potentiates Ca²⁺-dependent-calcium release via RyanR. This Ca²⁺ release from the RyanR plays role in the Ca²⁺ entry to mitochondria (Mito) via mitochondria channel uniporter (MCU).

Figure 3. Intracellular signaling pathways involved in ER calcium overload at AD.

Possible mechanisms involved in ER Ca²⁺ overload in AD.
I) FAD associated mutations cause disruption of passive Ca²⁺ leak function of presenilins, thus causing accumulation of Ca²⁺ in the ER lumen.
II) Aβ potentiate plasma membrane Ca²⁺-permeable channels, leading to the increase of cytosolic and ER Ca²⁺ content.
III) PS1 may interact with SERCA pump via direct protein-protein interaction thus potentiating its Ca²⁺ pumping activity.

Figure 4. Physiological regulation of nSOCE in hippocampal neurons.

nSOCE has two partners at different cellular compartments. ER-resident protein STIM2 and plasma membrane proteins ORAI2 and TRPC6. STIM2 has intraluminal domain that senses changes in ER Ca²⁺ concentration. When ER Ca²⁺ drops, Ca²⁺ dissociates from N-terminal calcium sensitive domain. That leads to conformational change of STIM2 that its oligomerization. In oligomerized form STIM2 travels to ER-PM junctions where it binds with plasma-membrane partners of nSOCE—ORAI2 and TRPC6 proteins. This binding allows opening of nSOC channels and Ca²⁺ entry into the neuron. We propose that this Ca²⁺ entry is necessary to maintain pCaMKII levels, and that is essential to maintain LTP.

Figure 5. Loss of stable postsynaptic contacts in AD.

A. Confocal images of at DIV 14 fixed hippocampal neurons in culture. Primary hippocampal neurons were transfected with TD-Tomato plasmid at DIV 7 and left untreated (control, CTRL) or treated for 3-4 days with synthetic oligomeric Aβ (Aβ). B. Cartoon representation of the synaptic loss observed in amyloid-beta induced synaptotoxic model of AD. Usually postsynaptic contacts are divided into three morphological groups. Mushroom spines have thin neck and big head, thin spines have thin neck and small head, barely distinguishable from neck and stubby spines that do not have head and more or less look like protrusions on dendritic shafts. Due to big head size mushroom spines able to make strong synapses that participate in memory formation and storage. Mushroom spines are selectively lost in AD models and proportion of thin spines is increased.

A, B Structures of hyperforin and NSN 21778. Structure of hyperforin is adopted from sigma aldrich web site. The structure of NSN 21778 is adopted from (132). C, The schema demonstrating neuroprotective mechanisms of Hyperforin and NSN 21778. Both these compounds activate TRPC 6 channels. However, hyperforin is a direct activator of TRPC 6, while NSN 21778 needs/or modulates DAG-dependent activation of TRPC 6 channels. Due to the activation of TRPC 6 channels Ca²⁺ enters the postsynaptic contacts and supports the functionality of CaMKII, which is necessary for LTP performance and preservation of spines and memory.
