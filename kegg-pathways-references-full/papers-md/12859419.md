### SUMMARY

1. Morphine and opiate narcotics are potent analgesics that have a high propensity to induce tolerance and physical dependence following their repeated administration.
2. The molecular basis of opiate dependence has not been completely elucidated, although the participation of opioid receptors is a prerequisite. Cellular dependence on opioids is believed to result from the chronic stimulation of opioid-regulated signalling networks.
3. As G-protein-coupled receptors, the opioid receptors must rely on heterotrimeric G-proteins for signal transduction. Recent advances in our understanding of G-protein signalling have unveiled novel signalling molecules and mechanisms, some of which may be intricately involved in the manifestation of opiate dependence.
4. In the present review, we will attempt to trace chronic opioid signals along elaborate G-protein-regulated pathways.

### INTRODUCTION

The primary and most effective treatment for severe pain is the administration of narcotic analgesics, such as morphine and other opiates; yet, these drugs are renowned for their ability to rapidly induce tolerance and dependence following repeated administration. In opioid tolerance, the intensity of opioid-induced effects decreases upon repeated administration and the dose of the opioid must be increased to manifest the same extent of effects. Physical dependence appears after discontinuation of opioid uptake and results in withdrawal symptoms, such as hyperanalgesia, gastrointestinal cramp and joint and muscle aches. The symptoms are suppressed by continuous administration of opioids and this repeated cycle rapidly leads to opioid addiction. The propensity of opiates to trigger marked tolerance and dependence seriously undermines the use of opiates in the management of severe pain.

The diverse biological effects of opiates, including analgesia and addiction, are manifested through specific opioid receptors that are distributed throughout our central and peripheral nervous systems. The opioid receptors, upon binding of opiate drugs (or endogenous opioid peptides), regulate a multitude of intracellular signalling pathways. The involvement of opioid receptors in opiate dependence is unequivocal because opioid receptor antagonists, such as naloxone, can rapidly precipitate withdrawal syndromes in opiate addicts. Opiate dependence cannot be explained solely on the basis of modification of opioid receptors or altered metabolism of the drug, but it clearly requires sustained activation of the receptors. The complex mechanism by which prolonged stimulation of these receptors triggers the development of dependence has not been fully elucidated. Numerous studies have shown that a multitude of signalling pathways are regulated by the opioid receptors through heterotrimeric G-proteins. Thus, a critical challenge in understanding the biological basis of opiate dependence is to account for the array of signalling processes triggered upon activation of the opioid receptors, especially those pathways that ultimately lead to changes in protein functions (e.g. by phosphorylation) or gene transcription. In the present review, we shall trace the opioid signals through the G-proteins and their effectors in an attempt to establish a rudimentary road map of chronic opioid signals. Comprehensive coverage on our understanding of opioid receptor signalling can be found in several recent reviews¹² and these reviews represent excellent sources of information.

### DIVERSIFICATION OF OPIOID SIGNALS BY G-PROTEINS

Opioid receptors are members of the superfamily of G-protein-coupled heptahelical receptors with the signature of seven transmembrane domains. In mammals, there are three well-characterized opioid receptors, classified as μ-, δ- and κ-opioid receptors. The existence of additional opioid receptor subtypes has been proposed based on the differential binding affinities of various opioid ligands. For instance, the three classical μ-, δ- and κ-opioid receptors have been subdivided into μ₁₋₃, δ₁₋₂ and κ₁₋₃ subtypes, respectively. Some of these subtypes are splice variants, whereas others may represent opioid receptor heterodimers that exhibit distinct pharmacological profiles and signalling capabilities. The three major types of opioid receptors have long been known to use

inhibitory G-proteins (G$_{i/o}$) for signal transduction because most opioid-induced signals can be effectively blocked by pertussis toxin (PTX), a bacterial toxin from *Bordetella pertussis* that ADP-ribosylates and inactivates G$_{i/o}$ proteins. Each opioid receptor appears to have the capacity to interact with five different forms of G$_{i/o}$ proteins (G$_{i1-3}$ and G$_{oA-B}$). As illustrated in Fig. 1, the G$_{i}$-coupled opioid receptors regulate a diverse spectrum of effectors ranging from adenylyl cyclases (AC) and ion channels to the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK).² Opioid-induced regulation of each class of effector molecules is highly complex and depends on the isoform of the effector. An example of the complexity of opioid signals is their regulation of intracellular cAMP. Among the 10 different isoforms of AC, the opioid receptors can inhibit the activities of AC1, 5, 6 and 8 via the Gα$_{i}$ subunits, whereas they activate AC2, 4 and 7 by using Gβγ complexes released from G$_{i}$ proteins.³⁻⁷ Isoform-specific and differential regulations of various classes of effectors by the opioid receptors are interwoven into a sophisticated signalling network that mediates opioid actions.

The opioid receptor is one of the first G$_{i}$-coupled receptors shown to use PTX-insensitive G-proteins for signal transduction. All three forms of opioid receptors can inhibit AC through the neuronal-specific G$_{z}$ in heterologous expression systems.⁶⁻⁸ G$_{z}$ is the only PTX-insensitive member of the G$_{i}$ subfamily because its α-subunit lacks the C-terminal cysteine residue that is the target site for PTX-catalysed ADP-ribosylation. Following the demonstration of its functional association with the opioid receptors, G$_{z}$ has, indeed, been shown to mediate opioid-induced supraspinal analgesia.⁹ The use of Gα-specific antisense oligodeoxynucleotides has affirmed the participation of G$_{z}$ and G$_{i}$ proteins in the mediation of opioid-induced supraspinal analgesia.⁹,¹⁰ Moreover, the coupling of μ-opioid receptors to G$_{z}$ in the mouse periaqueductal grey matter has been demonstrated biochemically.¹¹ Functional association of opioid receptors to G$_{z}$ opens a new chapter in opioid signalling because it has always been assumed that the opioid receptors are exclusively coupled to the PTX-sensitive G$_{i/o}$ proteins. The idea of opioid signalling via G$_{z}$ is especially attractive because of its predominant expression in neuronal tissues and its colocalization with opioid receptors in neuronal cell lines. Apart from inhibition of AC activity, G$_{z}$ is capable of regulating the activities of MAPK, K⁺ and Ca²⁺ ion channels, as well as interacting with novel effectors such as G-protein-regulated inducers of neurite outgrowth (GRIN) 1/2, Rap1-specific GTPase activating protein (Rap1GAP) and transcriptional coactivator Eya2 (a human homologue of the Drosophila Eya transcription coactivator).¹² The expanded effector-regulatory profile of G$_{z}$ (Fig. 1) raises the possibility that it may be used in opioid-induced tolerance and dependence.

In addition to G$_{z}$, the opioid receptors are capable of interacting with other PTX-insensitive G-proteins, including G$_{14}$¹³ and G$_{16}$.¹⁴ These linkages provide the opioid receptors with the ability to efficiently stimulate phospholipase C (PLC) and, hence, regulate an array of effectors that are usually under the control of G$_{q}$-coupled receptors (Fig. 1). For example, both G$_{14}$ and G$_{16}$ can stimulate the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and affect cell growth, and the differentiation and activation of JNK can, indeed, be observed in transfected COS-7 cells upon stimulation of opioid receptors (YH Wong, unpubl. data, 2002). In view of their restricted distribution in haematopoietic cells and peripheral tissues, Gα$_{14}$ and Gα$_{16}$ may be important players in supporting the immunomodulatory effects of opioids. Because the mRNA of Gα$_{16}$ (but not Gα$_{14}$) is also detected in the brain, Gα$_{16}$ could mediate some of the central actions of the opioids, especially those related to the regulation of MAPK. Both μ- and δ-opioid receptors can, indeed, activate JNK in neuroblastoma × glioma NG108-15 and SH-SY5Y cells (YH Wong, unpubl. data, 2002), akin to those previously reported for the opioid receptor-like (ORL₁) receptor.¹⁵

One of the controversial issues in opioid signalling is the ability of opioids and opiates to stimulate AC in a variety of tissues and cells.² Stimulation of specific isoforms of AC by Gβγ-subunits provides a route for opioids to raise the intracellular cAMP level.⁶,⁷ However, it has been proposed that the opioid receptors can use G$_{s}$ to modulate opioid analgesia, tolerance and dependence.¹⁶ In dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, treatment with GM1 ganglioside, but not with other gangliosides, rapidly converts the opioid receptors from an inhibitory to an excitatory mode. Similar treatments with GM1 ganglioside allow the δ-opioid receptor to stimulate cAMP formation in NG108-15 and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells.¹⁷ Although the relative contributions of G$_{s}$-linked signals to opioid-induced responses have not been determined, access to G$_{s}$-regulated pathways would provide the opioid receptors with additional controls on gene transcription through the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA; Fig. 1).

An important facet in considering the diversification of opioid signals is the multiple roles played by the Gβγ complex. In the past decade, a host of effectors and signalling molecules have been shown to functionally interact with Gβγ, resulting in a bewildering array of responses.¹⁸ In addition to the various isoforms of AC and PLC, Gβγ has been shown to regulate phosducin and phosducin-like proteins, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) iso- zymes, G-protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRK), Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk), G-protein-regulated inward rectifying potassium channels (GIRKs), voltage-gated Ca²⁺-selective channels (L, N and P/Q type), MAPK and Src tyrosine kinase. At a glance, signalling via Gβγ is tremendously complicated and, at times, counterproductive by opposing Gα-mediated effects (e.g. cAMP production by AC2 is supposedly regulated in opposite directions by Gβγ and Gα$_{i}$). Because Gβγ-mediated responses usually require a more robust stimulus than Gα-mediated events,¹⁹ a sustained activation of receptor is more likely to invoke Gβγ signalling than acute agonist challenge. This characteristic makes

the involvement of Gβγ-regulated pathways in mediating chronic opioid actions a highly appealing explanation. Furthermore, some of the Gβγ-responsive effectors can link activation of opioid receptors to gene transcription, which, in turn, can modify cellular responses to opioids.

# SIGNAL ROUTING AND MODULATION

A key question pertaining to the molecular basis of opioid dependence is, 'Which of the eight to nine distinct G-proteins actually carries the primary signal?' The answer is extremely elusive because, despite their structural similarities, the opioid receptors exhibit differences in their specificities for coupling to G-proteins. The fidelity of receptor and G-protein interactions is governed, in part, by the exact composition of the Gβγ complex, because the receptor recognizes the Gaβγ heterotrimer. Excluding the non-functional Gβγ complexes identified to date (e.g. Gβ2γ1), the number of unique Gaβγ heterotrimers theoretically available for signal transduction is well over 800. Defining the 'preferred permutation' of Gaβγ for the opioid receptors is a complex and difficult process. Hence, for clarity and simplicity, we shall disregard the exact composition of the Gβγ complex in opioid signalling. In general, the μ-, δ- and κ-opioid receptors appear to preferentially activate Go and Gi2 over the other Gi/o proteins,¹ but their coupling specificity to Gi/o proteins is governed, in part, by the types of tissues and cells being examined. The μ-opioid receptors endogenously expressed in the rat DRG sensory neurons interact with Go but not Gi1-3,²⁰ whereas the same receptors in various rodent brain areas bind to Gi1, Gi3 and, to a lesser extent, Gi2.²¹ Similarly, the κ-opioid receptor differentially activates GoB, Gi2 and Gi3 to inhibit AC activity in CHO cells,²² yet it uses Gi1, but not Go, to activate PLC in membranes of the guinea-pig cerebellum.²³ The δ-opioid receptor appears to prefer Gi1 rather than Go in evoking calcium-dependent chloride currents. Some of these observations may be attributed to differences in the GTPase activity of the Gi/o proteins. For instance, the GTP turnover number of Gaα1 induced by the activation of the δ-opioid receptor is more than threefold greater than that of GaαoA.²⁴ Subtle differences in structure among the three opioid receptors may affect their coupling specificity for G-proteins. In terms of their functional association with Gaα16, the δ-opioid receptor appears to be far better than the μ-opioid receptor.¹⁴ This may be due, in part, to the ability of the δ-opioid receptor to spontaneously adopt a ligand-independent active conformation²⁵ and the weak coupling of Gaα16 to the μ-opioid receptor could be rescued by altering the C-terminal structure of Gaα16.²⁶ Because the active conformation of the receptor is triggered upon binding of an agonist, agonists with different intrinsic activities may affect the formation and/or stabilization of different receptor/G-protein complexes and, thus, modulate signal routing. Indeed, it has been demonstrated that various μ-opioid receptor-selective ligands, including morphine, heroin, methadone and buprenorphine, use Gaα2 and Gaαz to induce analgesia, whereas heroin and methadone are capable of producing antinociception via Gaαi1 and GaαoA.²⁷

The fact that the same opioid receptor subtype in various tissues and cells exhibits different preferences for G-proteins suggests that

Fig. 1 Diversification of opioid signals. Opioid receptors can use both pertussis toxin (PTX)-sensitive and -insensitive G-proteins to regulate a multitude of effectors (see text for details).

specific regulatory molecules may be present in disparate cellular environments to define the receptor/G-protein coupling specificity. A prime example of regulatory molecules is represented by the regulators of G-protein signalling (RGS) that are pertinent to the activities of $G_{i/o}$ proteins.²⁸ The RGS proteins serve as GTPase-activating proteins (GAP) for G-proteins and, thus, they can modulate the duration of the G-protein signals. Among the numerous RGS proteins identified to date, many bind specifically and tightly to $G\alpha_{i/o}$. Most notable examples of RGS proteins for $G\alpha_{i/o}$ include RGS1, RGS4, RGS7, RGS10 and RGS19, whereas RGS20 has a high affinity for $G\alpha_z$.²⁸ The existence of multiple RGS proteins for the $G_i$ subfamily members suggests that the cellular activities of these G-proteins are tightly regulated. There is evidence to suggest that RGS proteins play a role in modulating receptor/G-protein interactions. In cells expressing the $\alpha_{2A}$-adreno-receptor, RGS4 enhances the agonist-stimulated GTPase activity of $G\alpha_{oA}$ and $G\alpha_{i2}$, but not of $G\alpha_{i1}$ and $G\alpha_{i3}$.²⁹ Like RGS4, RGS7 and RGS10 prefer to act on $G_{i/o}$ proteins. RGS7 is a weaker GAP than RGS4 toward $G\alpha_o$ and $G\alpha_{i1-2}$, but it is specific for $G\alpha_o$ over $G\alpha_{i1-2}$. Coimmunoprecipitation studies demonstrate that RGS10 associates specifically with the activated forms of $G\alpha_{i3}$ and $G\alpha_z$ and increases their GTP hydrolytic activity.³⁰ These results suggest that the differential coupling specificity of opioid receptors to G-proteins may be modulated by the presence of RGS proteins, thus further expanding the complexity of opioid signalling. The importance of RGS proteins in opioid signalling has recently been confirmed. It appears that RGS9 facilitates the development of acute opioid tolerance. The potency and duration of opioid antinociception are increased in mice with impaired RGS9 and these animals do not exhibit acute tolerance generated by a single and efficacious dose of morphine, nor do they develop tolerance after injection of opioid for 4 days.³¹ This implies that development of opiate tolerance could be modulated by altering the duration and/or amplitude of G-protein signals. In order to delineate the chronic opioid signals that travel along the G-protein signalling networks, we shall turn to a cellular model for opioid dependence.

### OPIOID-INDUCED AC SUPERACTIVATION

Repeated administration of morphine and opiate narcotics causes molecular and cellular adaptations that rapidly cumulate into tolerance and dependence. One of the hallmarks of these adaptations is an upregulation of AC responsiveness, commonly referred to as AC superactivation. It was found that subsequent to chronic morphine treatment and morphine abstinence, the rodent brain became more responsive to drugs that elevate cAMP levels³² and the observation of an increase in cAMP level upon opioid withdrawal was reproduced in NG108-15 cells.³³ This phenomenon of ‘cAMP overshoot’ or AC superactivation is observed in a variety of cell types expressing opioid receptors, including human mammary epidermoid carcinoma A431 cells, COS-7, CHO and HEK 293 cells.³,⁵,³⁴,³⁵ Similarly, AC superactivation is observed in opioid-tolerant guinea-pig longitudinal muscle/myenteric plexus preparations.³⁶ However, it should be noted that AC superactivation is not unique to the opioid receptors and is observed with other $G_i$-coupled receptors.

Numerous attempts have been made to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying opioid-induced AC superactivation. It has now become obvious that the participation of $G_{i/o}$ proteins is a prerequisite for this phenomenon. Treatment with PTX can effectively prevent opioid-induced AC superactivation in many different types of tissues and cells examined.³,⁵,³⁴ Given that each of the three opioid receptors can interact with multiple PTX-sensitive G-proteins,² which of these G-proteins is actually responsible for eliciting AC superactivation? Elimination of the PTX-catalysed ADP-ribosylation site at their $G\alpha$ subunits would confer PTX-resistance to $G_{i/o}$ proteins and, thereby, allow the assessment of their individual contribution to opioid-induced AC superactivation. Pertussis toxin-resistant mutants of $G_{i/o}$ are perfectly capable of recognizing receptors and regulating downstream effectors. In PTX-treated HEK 293 cells, all three forms of opioid receptors can use PTX-resistant mutants of $G\alpha_{i1-3}$ to inhibit forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation and stimulate the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases (ERK) that belong to the MAPK family. When these mutants were examined for their ability to support opioid-induced AC superactivation in HEK 293 cells, PTX remained effective in blocking the AC superactivation,³⁷,³⁸ indicating that none of the $G\alpha_i$ subunits was sufficient to support this chronic opioid response. The other remaining PTX-sensitive candidates are the $G\alpha_{oA-B}$. Again, neither of the two PTX-resistant $G\alpha_o$ mutants supported opioid-induced AC superactivation (YH Wong, unpubl. data, 2001). Together with similar experiments performed by overexpressing the PTX-insensitive $G\alpha_z$ in HEK 293 cells,³⁴,³⁵ this series of studies has led to the realization that AC superactivation requires the coordination of multiple signalling pathways, which is often obligatory in complex cellular responses. The inability of $G_z$ and individual PTX-resistant $G_{i/o}$ mutants to support the opioid-induced AC superactivation insinuates an absolute dependence on PTX-sensitive $G_{i/o}$ proteins or that multiple $G_{i/o}$ proteins are required.

Why would multiple $G_{i/o}$ proteins be required for opioid-induced AC superactivation? A possible reason is that, unlike acute opioid actions, multiple pathways need to be activated in a coordinated manner for AC superactivation. Certainly, the opioid receptors can interact simultaneously with multiple G-proteins, including $G_{i1-3}$, $G_o$ and $G_z$.¹,² Naloxone-precipitated withdrawal syndrome can be reduced by intracerebroventricular injection of anti-$G\alpha_{i2}$, $G\alpha_z$ or $G\alpha_{oA/B}$ antibodies in morphine-dependent mice.³⁹ Similarly, morphine-6β-glucuronide (M6G)-induced supraspinal analgesia in mice is prevented by intracerebroventricular administration of oligodeoxynucleotides targeting $G\alpha_{i1}$ and $G\alpha_z$, whereas $G\alpha_{i2}$, $G\alpha_{i3}$, $G\alpha_o$ and $G\alpha_z$ antisense probes abolish spinal M6G analgesia.¹⁰ Although members of the $G_i$ subfamily exhibit considerable functional similarities (e.g. $G\alpha_{i1-3}$, $G\alpha_{oA-B}$ and $G\alpha_z$ all inhibit AC), most are also capable of regulating unique effectors; $G\alpha_o$, but not $G\alpha_{i2}$, preferentially interacts with Rap1 GAP and, thus, regulates the activity of the small G-protein Rap.⁴⁰ Moreover, $G\alpha_o$ is capable of activating the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)-3⁴¹ and B-Raf.⁴² Hence, the inability of individual $G_{i/o}$ protein to support opioid-induced AC superactivation may reflect its inadequacy in subserving the functions of other $G_{i/o}$ proteins.

Alternatively, simultaneous activation of multiple PTX-sensitive G-proteins may be required to generate a sufficiently large signal to elicit a downstream response. A common denominator in signalling by $G_{i/o}$ proteins, in fact by all heterotrimeric G-proteins, is the concurrent activation of the $G\beta\gamma$-regulated pathways.

principle, G<sub>i</sub>-coupled receptors can access a much larger pool of Gβγ complexes by virtue of their ability to activate multiple G<sub>i/o</sub> proteins, whereas G<sub>s</sub>- and G<sub>q</sub>-linked receptors are less efficient in the formation of free Gβγ dimers. This theoretical consideration is in agreement with the fact that AC superactivation is only associated with G<sub>i</sub>-coupled receptors. Ample evidence has indicated that opioids use Gβγ in their signalling. Opioids use Gβγ complexes rather than the Gα-subunits of G<sub>i/o</sub> proteins to stimulate the activities of PLC and AC2 in certain cell types.<sup>6,7</sup> Could Gβγ participate in opioid-induced AC superactivation? If Gβγ complexes are, indeed, required to induce AC superactivation, PTX-catalysed ADP-ribosylation of G<sub>i/o</sub> proteins may reduce the pool of opioid-releasable Gβγ-subunits to such an extent that activation of any one type of G-protein alone cannot mobilize sufficient amounts of Gβγ. The Gβγ released from G<sub>i/o</sub> proteins is, indeed, used in the induction of AC superactivation. A series of studies have illustrated that the phenomenon of AC superactivation is abolished by Gβγ scavengers such as Gα<sub>1</sub> and the C-terminal fragment of β-adrenoceptor kinase.<sup>4,36,43</sup> It is interesting to note that AC isoforms display differential sensitivity to free Gβγ-subunits. For instance, Gβ<sub>1</sub> mediates greater inhibition of the activities of AC5 and AC6 than Gβ<sub>5</sub>. The inhibitory ability of Gβ<sub>5</sub> is enhanced by the cotransfection of Gγ<sub>2</sub>. Both Gβ<sub>1</sub>γ<sub>2</sub> and Gβ<sub>5</sub>γ<sub>2</sub> inhibit AC1 activity, whereas AC2 is stimulated by Gβ<sub>1</sub>γ<sub>2</sub> but inhibited by Gβ<sub>5</sub>γ<sub>2</sub>.<sup>44</sup> In addition, it is of note that the two subtypes of Gα<sub>i/o</sub> exhibit different preferences for Gβγ complexes.<sup>45</sup> It remains to be seen whether different G<sub>i/o</sub> proteins use different combinations of Gβγ-subunits for signalling.

A series of studies lend staunch support to the notion that the opioid-induced AC superactivation is isozyme specific.<sup>4,5</sup> Among the various isoforms of AC, types 1, 5, 6 and 8 become superactivated upon chronic opioid treatment. The HEK 293 cells are known to express AC1 and AC6 and both are negatively regulated by Gα<sub>i1–3</sub>. Gβγ complexes do not seem to activate AC5 and AC6 directly, in contrast with their ability to activate AC2 and AC4 directly.<sup>46</sup> Despite a lack of direct association with Gβγ, superactivation of AC5 and AC6 is abolished by the removal of Gβγ with Gβγ scavengers.<sup>4,43</sup> If involvement of Gβγ is, indeed, critical for AC superactivation, then effectors that are regulated by Gβγ may serve as intermediate targets. A variety of effectors is regulated by opioid receptors through Gβγ. The ERK1/2 are obvious candidates among the Gβγ targets. Activation of opioid receptors has been shown to enhance the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and, interestingly, the opioid-induced response is abolished by chronic opioid

**Fig. 2** Multiple signalling pathways link opioid receptors to adenylyl cyclase (AC) and cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB). Opioid receptors use both Gα<sub>i/o</sub> and the βγ-complex to regulate AC and CREB activities. Gα<sub>i/o</sub> suppresses cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) by inhibiting AC1, 5, 6 and 8. Gβγ stimulates AC2, 4 and 7, but inhibits AC1. In addition, Gβγ inhibits AC1, 3, 5 and 6 through phospholipase Cβ (PLCβ)-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization and activation of calmodulin kinase 2,4 (CaMK2,4), but stimulates AC1 and 8 and AC1–3, 5 and 7 through PLCβ-stimulated Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin (CaM) and protein kinase C (PKC), respectively. The activity of CREB is regulated by the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade through B-Raf or c-Raf-1.

treatment.³⁴,³⁵,³⁷,³⁸ This raises the possibility that AC superactivation may arise from deregulation of ERK signalling. However, abolition of Gβγ-regulated ERK1/2 activity has no effect on the mediation of the phenomenon.⁴⁷ In HEK 293 cells, U0126 (an inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK) 1/2) completely prevents μ-opioid from inducing ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Despite numerous reports on cross-regulation of the ERK and AC pathways,⁴⁸ U0126 does not affect the ability of opioids either to inhibit forskolin-elevated AC activity or to induce AC superactivation.⁴⁷ However, the lack of participation of ERK1/2 activity in the mediation of opioid-induced AC superactivation does not preclude the involvement of other MAPK. Cumulative reports have demonstrated that the opioid receptors can stimulate both JNK and p38 MAPK.¹⁵,⁴⁹ The role of JNK and p38 MAPK in acute and chronic opioid actions remains to be investigated. Given that G-protein signals invariably lead to changes in gene expression, activation of the opioid receptors should lead to transcriptional events.

REGULATION OF TRANSCRIPTION BY OPIOIDS

Opioid-induced long-term functional alterations of the nervous system presumably involve changes in gene expression.⁵⁰,⁵¹ Ample evidence suggests that many opioid-induced signals could, indeed, converge at the level of transcription factors, but little is known with regard to the importance of gene transcription in the development of opiate tolerance and dependence. A series of elegant studies has revealed that opioids are capable of simultaneously manipulating several transcription factors, including cyclic AMP-response element DNA-binding protein (CREB), members of the MAPK cascade and nuclear factor (NF)-κB.⁵²,⁵³

It has been shown that chronic opiate administration selectively upregulates types 1 and 8 AC in the locus coeruleus through CREB,⁵⁴,⁵⁵ one of the major cAMP-regulated transcription factors in the brain. The opioid receptors use both Gα and Gβγ to

In addition to Gαi/o subunits (see Fig. 2), opioid receptors could use Gβγ to regulate MAPK cascade and transcriptional events by recruiting phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), Shc, Grb2 and SOS (a guanine sRac/Cdc42, member of the Rho family GTPases) to form a complex.

modulate the activity of CREB through the cAMP pathway, as shown in Fig. 2. cAMP response element-binding protein is phosphorylated by PKA at Ser<sup>133</sup> and becomes activated and translocated to the nucleus, where it regulates transcription of immediate early genes. cAMP response element-binding protein mediates the actions of opioids related to the expression of genes in brain regions responsible for drug-seeking behaviour and development of signs of dependence.<sup>56</sup> Genetic disruption of α-IX and δ-isofoms of CREB<sup>57</sup> and intralocus coeruleus infusion of CREB antisense oligonucleotide reduce the concentration of CREB, as well as the development of physical dependence to opiates.<sup>54</sup> Similarly, phosphorylation of CREB in the dorsal horn region of the spinal cord is increased in morphine-tolerant mice, indicating that chronic exposure to opioids causes changes in gene expression in sensory processing areas of the spinal cord.<sup>53</sup> Similar observations have been extended to the nucleus accumbens, a region implicated in the reinforcing actions of opiates,<sup>58</sup> and acute challenges by morphine and δ-opioid peptides produce a dose-dependent increase in CREB phosphorylation in NG108-15 cells.<sup>59</sup> These findings suggest that CREB is implicated in opioid antinociception and is, perhaps, involved in opioid-induced AC superactivation. However, chronic opioid treatment does not enhance the forskolin-induced phosphorylation of CREB in HEK 293 cells expressing various types of opioid receptors, despite clear induction of AC superactivation.<sup>34,35</sup> Moreover, chronic, but not acute, morphine administration decreases the levels of CREB immunoreactivity in the nucleus accumbens.<sup>60</sup> Such contrasting results point to the difficulty in generalizing the involvement of CREB in mediating opiate dependence. It should be noted that, as a signalling molecule lying relatively downstream in the cAMP-regulated pathway, CREB is subject to multiple regulatory factors, such as PKA, MAPK cascade, Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin and the protein kinase C (PKC) pathway (Fig. 2). Other signalling molecules associated with the AC pathway are also affected by prolonged exposure to opiates. These include cAMP-dependent phosphoproteins, G-protein subunits and GRK, as well as the opioid receptors themselves.<sup>56,61</sup> Cross-talk between other molecules, such as ERK and PKA,<sup>62</sup> may be required for CREB-dependent transcription. The regulation of transcription factors is obviously one potential mechanism for manifesting chronic opiate-induced adaptational changes.<sup>56</sup>

In addition to modulating CREB activity, the opioid receptors are capable of stimulating the MAPK cascades. All three sets of mammalian MAPK modules are subject to regulation by opioids. Stimulation of ERK1/2 by opioids was first demonstrated with the μ-opioid receptor in recombinant CHO cells.<sup>63</sup> The stimulation showed ligand selectivity, agonist dose dependency and PTX sensitivity. Similarly, the κ- and δ-opioid receptors are able to stimulate the phosphorylation and activation of ERK1/2 in heterologous expression systems.<sup>64</sup> Activation of MAPK occurs through the Gβγ-subunits released from Gi/o-proteins in a Ras-dependent manner (Fig. 3). In COS-7 cells expressing opioid receptors, opioid-induced activation of ERK1/2 is prevented by PTX, as well as cotransfection with dominant negative mutant N17-Ras or with a Gβγ-scavenger,<sup>65</sup> indicating the involvement of Ras and Gβγ. Chronic systemic administration of morphine leads to a sustained increase in the ERK1/2 phosphorylation state in the ventral tegmental area without altering the level of ERK1/2 immunoreactivity.<sup>66</sup> Upon opioid withdrawal, a dramatic increase in

ERK1/2 phosphorylation is also observed in the locus coeruleus.<sup>67</sup> Again, the presence of multiple regulators of MAPK cascades, for example, Gβγ, Ras, PKC and tyrosine kinases,<sup>64,65</sup> makes it difficult to decipher the exact mechanism by which opioid receptors regulate ERK1/2. It is conceivable that opioids use the ERK1/2 cascade controlled by the Gβγ-subunits released from Gi/o-proteins to activate transcription factors like Elk-1. Opioids can induce the expression of c-fos in parts of the striatum and several limbic brain areas.<sup>68</sup> *In vitro* studies have demonstrated that the Gβγ-regulated ERK1/2 cascade-activated transcription factor Elk-1 is engaged in the regulation of gene expression in CHO cells expressing opioid receptors. Agonist stimulation leads to phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and activation of Elk-1, both of which are prevented by PTX treatment, Gβγ-scavenging and inhibition of MEK.<sup>69</sup>

There is increasing evidence that the opioid receptors are capable of activating JNK and p38 MAPK. The JNK transmits signals from environmental stresses, inflammatory cytokines, growth factors and certain G-protein-coupled receptor agonists to the nucleus to selectively phosphorylate c-Jun, thereby enhancing its transcriptional activity. Transient expression experiments in COS-7 cells have revealed that activation of the classical types of opioid receptors induces weak stimulation of JNK.<sup>15</sup> It remains ambiguous as to which signalling pathway links opioid receptors to JNK. Recently, a series of studies has shown that opioids may use PI3K-independent and Ras/Rac-dependent pathways to manipulate JNK.<sup>15</sup> The ORL<sub>1</sub> receptor has been demonstrated to be able to activate JNK. Activation of ORL<sub>1</sub> receptors in NG108-15 cells results in stimulation of JNK accompanied by the active phosphorylation of c-Jun and activating transcription factor-2. This response is PTX-sensitive, resistant to PI3K inhibition and may involve the participation of Ras/Rac pathways.<sup>15</sup> Preliminary results from our laboratory suggest that the classical opioid receptors can also mediate JNK activity in a Rac/Cdc42-dependent manner. Interestingly, the opioid receptors can use more than one signalling pathway to regulate JNK. In addition to regulation of JNK, another module of MAPK, the p38 MAPK, is also subjected to regulation by opioids. The p38 MAPK cascade is responsible for transmitting stress and apoptotic signals from cell surface to nucleus. It is now known that the molecular mechanisms connecting opioid receptors to p38 MAPK use PKA and PKC. In NG108-15 cells, stimulation of endogenous opioid receptors leads to activation of p38 MAPK, which is abolished by selective opioid antagonists, pretreatment with PTX or SB203580 (a specific inhibitor of p38 MAPK) and the response is diminished by a PKA inhibitor but potentiated by PKC inhibitors.<sup>49</sup> It remains to be seen whether the known signalling components used in the regulation of JNK and p38 MAPK cascades are essential for opioid-induced activation of JNK and p38 MAPK that may contribute to the development of opioid tolerance and dependence.

Linkage of opioid receptors to the MAPK provides opioids with additional capability to regulate gene transcription via a number of transcription factors, including activator protein (AP)-1, Elk-1 and c-jun. Regulation of AP-1 activity by opioids has been demonstrated in the rat hypothalamus,<sup>70</sup> whereas c-fos mRNA levels in various regions of the rat brain are elevated upon acute opiate treatment.<sup>71</sup> Gel-shift assays of nuclear extracts from NG108-15 cells have revealed that an increase of AP-1 DNA-binding activity ensues upon prolonged exposure to opioid peptides.<sup>72</sup> Chronic

opioid treatment of primary cultures of rat cortical neurons has been shown to induce both AP-1 and NF-κB activity.⁷³ Prolonged increases in AP-1 activity are associated with the induction of novel 35–37 kDa Fos-related antigens in specific brain regions of morphine-treated rats.⁷⁴ Withdrawal studies have further demonstrated robust induction of c-Fos, FosB, Fra-1, Fra-2, c-Jun and Jun-B mRNA,⁷⁴ indicating that opioid-induced adaptational changes involve transcriptional regulation. Through the PTX-insensitive Gz and the transcription coactivator Eya2, opioid receptors may possess the ability to regulate the myocyte enhancer factor 3 (MEF3)/TATA transcription factor. Interestingly, GaZ-deficient mice are hypertolerant to morphine, suggesting that the presence of Gz delays the development of opiate tolerance.⁷⁵ Given that a multitude of signalling pathways are regulated by the opioid receptors, chronic activation of the opioid receptors is bound to influence transcriptional activities. However, the extent of induction of transcription factors and their involvement in opiate dependence remain to be fully explored.

# CONCLUSIONS

The diverse pharmacological and physiological actions of opiates and opioids are attributed to the ability of opioid receptors to trigger multiple signal transduction pathways through a variety of G-proteins. Signal regulation at the level of G-proteins by molecules such as RGS proteins can modulate the connectivity between components of an opioid signalling cascade. Although AC superactivation can be considered a hallmark of cellular adaptation to chronic opioid actions, the molecular mechanism underlying this phenomenon is difficult to tease apart. Pertussis toxin-sensitive Gi/o proteins and their associated Gβγ-subunits appear to be essential for the development of AC superactivation and their involvement may be associated with spatiotemporally ordered changes in gene expression. Because opioid-induced changes in gene expression are being demonstrated in a variety of tissues and cells with increasing frequency, it is only logical to predict that opiate dependence would also require adjustments in transcriptional activities. The next key issue will, of course, be focused at the genes that are crucial to the manifestation of opiate dependence. In this regard, microarray and gene profiling technologies are immensely useful in unraveling the molecular basis of opiate dependence.
