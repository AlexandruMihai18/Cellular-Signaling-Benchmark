# Phospholipase signalling networks in cancer

**Jong Bae Park, Chang Sup Lee, Jin-Hyeok Jang, Jaewang Ghim, Youn-Jae Kim, Sungyoung You, Daehee Hwang, Pann-Ghill Suh and Sung Ho Ryu**

**Abstract |** Phospholipases (PLC, PLD and PLA) are essential mediators of intracellular and intercellular signalling. They can function as phospholipid-hydrolysing enzymes that can generate many bioactive lipid mediators, such as diacylglycerol, phosphatidic acid, lysophosphatidic acid and arachidonic acid. Lipid mediators generated by phospholipases regulate multiple cellular processes that can promote tumorigenesis, including proliferation, migration, invasion and angiogenesis. Although many individual phospholipases have been extensively studied, how phospholipases regulate diverse cancer-associated cellular processes and the interplay between different phospholipases have yet to be fully elucidated. A thorough understanding of the cancer-associated signalling networks of phospholipases is necessary to determine whether these enzymes can be targeted therapeutically.

Phospholipids, including phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylinositol, are major structural components of the cell membrane^{1,2}. Furthermore, phospholipids can be broken down into bioactive lipid mediators by phospholipases, such as phospholipase A (PLA), PLC and PLD, through hydrolysis^{3,4}. Through intercellular and intracellular signalling, lipid mediators regulate a variety of cellular physiological and pathophysiological functions, including proliferation, survival, migration, vesicle trafficking, tumorigenesis, metastasis and inflammation^{5,6}.

Until recently, research on phospholipases has been carried out in a subfamily-specific manner. Each phospholipase regulates specific signalling pathways, but shares common signalling molecules with other members of its subfamily as upstream regulators or downstream effectors. Recent findings have indicated that phospholipases crosstalk with one another, influencing cell fate by integrating and fine-tuning intracellular signals^{3–5}. To understand these complex signalling systems in the micro-environments of tumours, as well as in individual tumour cells, systematic analyses of phospholipase functions are required. In this Opinion article, we summarize our current understanding of the various roles of phospholipases in tumour progression, with a focus on the signalling networks of phospholipases. We also discuss potential strategies for treating cancer through the disruption of these networks.

**Characteristics of phospholipases**

Phospholipases can be categorized into three major classes, PLA (consisting of A1 and A2), PLC and PLD, which are differentiated by the type of reaction that they catalyse^{7,8} (FIG. 1a). For example, PLA1 and PLA2 target the sn-1 and sn-2 positions of the glycerol moieties of phospholipids to generate free fatty acids and 2-acyl lysophospholipid or 1-acyl lysophospholipid, respectively. Phosphatidylinositol-hydrolysing PLC cleaves the bond between the glycerol and phosphate moieties to generate the phosphorylated base (inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (*IP*~3~; also known as Ins(1,4,5)P~3~)) and diacylglycerol (DAG). Phosphatidylcholine-hydrolysing PLD hydrolyses the phosphodiester bond between glycerol phosphate and the substituent to generate a free base (choline) and phosphatidic acid.

Each class of phospholipase is composed of many isotypes with distinct functions, domains and regulatory mechanisms^{9–12} (FIG. 1b–d). Cytosolic PLA2 (cPLA2s) and PLCδ1 have a calcium-binding C2 domain, which is required for activating these enzymes; in PLCδ1 this may occur through an enzyme–phosphatidylserine–calcium ternary complex^{11,13}. Unlike the C2 domain of PLCδ1, PLCβ1 and PLCβ2 C2 domains do not interact with lipid membranes in the presence of calcium but instead associate with GTP-bound Gα~q~, which leads to the activation of native enzymes (PLCβ1 and PLCβ2)^{14}. Additionally, PLC (with the

Figure 1 | Overview of phospholipases. a | Phospholipases are classified into three major types, according to their hydrolytic cleavage site. Phospholipase A1 (PLA1) and PLA2 enzymes cleave fatty acyl ester bonds at the sn-1 and sn-2 sites of the glycerol backbone of the substrate, respectively. PLCs and PLDs hydrolyse the first and second phosphodiester bond of phospholipids, respectively. X indicates a base (choline, ethanolamine, serine, glycerol or inositol). b | Thirteen mammalian PLC isotypes are subdivided into six groups¹¹,¹²¹. PLC X and Y domains contain catalytic activity. Several isoforms have pleckstrin homology (PH) or SRC homology 2 (SH2) domains. The calcium-binding (C2) domain can regulate PLC activity. The EF-hand domain is responsible for forming a flexible tether to the PH domain. PLCe has a RAS guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) domain for RAP1A¹²², and the RA2 domain mediates the interaction with GTP-bound RAS and RAP1A. c | In mammals, PLD1 and PLD2 hydrolyse phosphatidylcholine (PC)¹²³. PC-PLD has several conserved regions, including phox homology (PX) and PH domains, and two conserved catalytic domains (HKD). Non-PC-hydrolysing PLD3, PLD4 and mitochondrial PLD (MitoPLD) have recently been described¹²⁴–¹²⁶. They have HKD domains similar to PLD1 and PLD2, as well as a transmembrane (TM) domain, but not much more is known¹²⁷. d | The three major types of PLA2 include secretory PLA2 (sPLA2), cytosolic PLA2 (cPLA2) and calcium-independent PLA2 (iPLA2). Eleven sPLA2, six cPLA2 and nine iPLA2 have been found in mammals¹⁰. sPLA2 has a signal sequence to target the extracellular region, a Ca²⁺-binding loop, and a catalytic site. cPLA1α, cPLA1β, cPLA1δ, cPLA1ε and cPLA1ζ have a C2 domain, and a lysophospholipase-like domain. iPLA2β has ankyrin repeats, which may mediate its oligomerization. Both iPLA2δ and PNPLA7 also have a cyclic AMP-binding domain and a patatin domain that is implicated in enzymatic activity. PLA1 has not been well characterized and has few links to cancer.

exception of PLCζ) and PLD have pleckstrin homology (PH) domains that are important for binding various lipids and proteins. The PH domain of each phospholipase can bind different molecules. For example, the PH domain of PLCβ2 is involved in the interaction with the heterotrimeric G protein subunit Gβγ to directly mediate activation of the catalytic core of PLCβ2 (REF. 15). PLCγ1 is translocated to the membrane and activated by binding phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P₃) via the PH domain in a PI3K-dependent manner¹⁶. The PH domain of PLD1 is important for regulating PLD activity by modulating its intracellular localization via interactions with phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P₂)¹⁷. Furthermore, the PLD1 PH domain has two fatty acylation (palmitoylation) sites, which lead to strong membrane binding¹⁸. However, it has been reported that the PH domains of PLD1 and PLD2 are not required for PLD activation¹⁹,²⁰. Furthermore, the PLD1 phox homology (PX) domain has been reported to bind to PtdIns(3,4,5)P₃, as well as to phosphatidylinositol-5-phosphate (PtdIns5P)²¹–²³. According to recent reports, the PLD PX domain serves as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for dynamin, and a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for RHOA, and the PLD PH domain acts as a GEF for RAC2 (REFS 24–26). These multi-interacting and multifunctional characteristics of the domains in phospholipases may be determinants for ‘hub-like’ roles in various cell signalling pathways (described below).

Phospholipase signalling
Phospholipases can be activated by multiple extracellular signals, including hormones (for example, insulin and growth hormones), growth factors (for example, epidermal growth factor (EGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)) and lipids (for example, lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), and sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P))¹¹,²⁷–²⁹ (FIG. 2). These extracellular cues stimulate phospholipases via direct activation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) or G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs)²⁹–³¹. Phospholipases can transmit signals to a variety of downstream molecules via lipid mediators. As shown in FIG. 2, phospholipases and their lipid mediators induce hierarchical, multilayered signalling networks. Furthermore, lipid mediators are key factors that participate in a variety of cellular processes that are related to tumorigenesis and/or metastasis, such as matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) secretion, actin cytoskeleton reorganization, migration, proliferation, growth, inflammation and angiogenesis⁹–¹². The importance of phospholipases and their products (that is, lipid mediators) for key cellular functions has been characterized by cell-based analysis and by studies using transgenic and knockout mice. Studies using transgenic and knockout mice have demonstrated that

PERSPECTIVES

phospholipases are crucially involved in various phenotypes (Supplementary information S1 (table)). Specifically, many studies on phospholipase transgenic and knockout mice have demonstrated tumour-related phenotypes, such as tumorigenesis, metastasis and angiogenesis, in a variety of organs, including the intestine, colon, lung and ovary (TABLE 1). The following sections discuss what we have learned from studies in cell lines and mouse models about the functions of various phospholipases in cancer-associated processes.

### Phospholipases in cell proliferation

Phospholipases are involved in pathways that regulate cell proliferation, although the molecular mechanisms underlying the roles of particular phospholipases and their corresponding lipid mediators in this process vary.

#### PLC

Among the phospholipases, PLC family members are the most well known for their role in signalling pathways that are involved in cell proliferation. Different PLC families share catalytic properties but they are characterized by distinct regulatory interactions. The role of PLCγ in proliferative pathways was first identified by the requirement of this enzyme for growth factor signalling — such as through EGF receptor (EGFR) and platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) pathways — which is mediated by the interaction between a phosphoryrosine residue, found in activated receptors, and the SH2 domain of PLCγ<sup>32,33</sup>. PLCγ activates mitogen-mediated signalling events through second messengers, leading to gene expression changes via protein kinase C (PKC), and the SH3 domain of PLCγ can interact with SOS1 to enhance RAS activity<sup>34</sup>. The involvement of PLCε in proliferation has been implicated by its role in RAS signalling. Unlike PLCγ and PLCε, the PLCβ and PLCδ isoforms are known to be tumour suppressors. Loss of PLCβ3 in mice can result in myeloproliferative diseases, lymphoma and other types of cancer through the regulation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) phosphorylation<sup>40</sup> (TABLE 1). The finding that a catalytically inactive mutant of PLCβ3 also reduced proliferation and STAT5 phosphorylation indicates that PLCβ3 contains tumour-suppressive activity that does not require phospholipase activity. Instead, the identification of a tripartite molecular complex suggests that PLCβ3 functions as a signalling scaffold that brings the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP1 (also known as PTPN6) in close proximity to STAT5 to decrease STAT5 phosphorylation<sup>40</sup>. Consistent with this, downregulation of PLCβ3 expression has been observed in human chronic lymphocytic leukaemia samples<sup>40</sup>. Furthermore, mon allelic deletion of *PLCB1* (which encodes PLCβ1) increases the risk of developing acute myeloid leukaemia in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome<sup>41</sup>. *PLCD1* (which encodes PLCδ1) was recently identified to be a tumour suppressor located on 3p22, a region that is frequently deleted in oesophageal squamous cell carcinomas (ESCCs)<sup>42</sup>. In addition, decreased PLCδ1 expression correlated with poor clinical outcome in patients with acute or chronic myeloid leukaemia<sup>42</sup>. Furthermore, hyperplasia was observed in the skin of *Plcd1*-knockout mice<sup>43</sup> (TABLE 1). Although some mechanistic details remain unclear, the position of PLCs, in the vicinity of cell surface receptors that relay signals from the extracellular microenvironment, might enable them to amplify downstream signals through the generation of second messengers, activating effectors such as PKC and other phospholipases to continue the propagation of mitogenic signals (FIG. 2).

#### PLD

Many studies have reported that PLD activity increases in response to mitogenic signals (such as EGF<sup>44</sup>, PDGF<sup>45</sup> and fibroblast growth factor (FGF)<sup>46</sup>) and oncogene expression (such as *v-ras*<sup>47</sup>, *v-raf*<sup>48</sup> and *v-src*<sup>49</sup>). Elevated PLD activity has been shown to contribute to the transformation of fibroblasts by its association with SRC or EGFR<sup>50,51</sup>. The generation of phosphatidic acid by PLD recruits RAF to the plasma membrane to activate MAPK signalling<sup>52</sup>. Furthermore, recent work has revealed that PLD2-generated phosphatidic acid recruits SOS1 to the plasma membrane and

Figure 2 | Overview of phospholipase pathways and networks. A variety of extracellular ligands bind to and activate specific receptors, such as receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). In GPCR signalling, phospholipase Cβ (PLCβ) is activated by the Ga or Gβγ subunit, and PLCε is stimulated by a small GTPase (RAP2B or RHOA). In the case of PLCδ, activation of the Gα-interacting GPCR (α1-adrenergic, oxytocin and thromboxane receptor) and GTP binding of Gα induces dissociation of PLCδ from Gα. Released PLCδ is then activated by calcium. In RTK signalling, RTKs directly recruit and phosphorylate PLCγ. Activated PLC can generate two second messengers, diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3), by hydrolysing phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2). DAG and IP3-induced calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum can activate protein kinase C (PKC), which stimulates PLD activity in a phosphorylation-dependent or a phosphorylation-independent manner. PLD hydrolyses phosphatidylcholine (PC) into phosphatidic acid (PA), which can recruit and activate multiple downstream molecules. Calcium binding and phosphorylation by ERK can fully activate cytosolic PLA2 (cPLA2). Intracellular calcium-independent PLA2 (iPLA2) is phosphorylated by PKC. cPLA2 and iPLA2 can hydrolyse various phospholipids, including PC, phosphatidylserine (PS) and PA, into arachidonic acid (AA), which is further converted into prostaglandins (PGs) and leukotrienes (LTs). PGs and LTs can act as autocrine or paracrine mediators and are generated from AA through two major pathways, the cyclooxygenase (COX) pathway and the lipoxygenase (LOX) pathway, respectively. Membrane-associated PA-selective PLA1 (mPA-PLA1) and secretory PLA2 (sPLA2) convert PA into lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), which can activate autocrine or paracrine signalling. Red boxes and circles indicate PLC signalling, beige indicates PLD signalling and green indicates PLA2 signalling.

activates RAS, which promotes cell proliferation and transformation. In addition to RAS-MAPK signalling, mTOR signalling, an essential regulator of cell proliferation, is also activated by phosphatidic acid. Phosphatidic acid can directly interact with mTOR complexes and increase the phosphorylation of S6 kinase (S6K) and 4E binding protein 1 (4EBP1).

Although the functional importance of phosphatidic acid-dependent S6K and 4EBP1 activation has not been clarified, the involvement of these molecules in cell growth during tumorigenesis has been well documented. Considering the many lines of evidence regarding the role of PLD in cell proliferation, it is plausible that PLD could coordinate upstream growth signals,

through protein–protein interactions and lipid mediators, with downstream signalling effects such as MAPK and mTOR.

Elevated PLD activity and expression have been found in many types of human cancer, including breast, colon, gastric and kidney cancer (TABLE 2). Expression levels of PLD2 correlate with tumour size and the survival of patients with colorectal

isoforms of PLA2 may have opposing functions: cPLA2 can generate AA to produce PGEs and enhance tumorigenesis, but sPLA2 has tumour-suppressive functions. Furthermore, as the PLA2-knockout mouse strains do not have cell type-specific deletion of PLA2, there is also the possibility that the function of PLA2 might not be directly related to cancer cell proliferation, but rather to the tumour-associated microenvironment.

### Phospholipases in invasion and metastasis

Tumour invasion and metastasis are coordinated events between the tumour microenvironment and individual tumour cells. These processes can be considered a result of multicellular communication between cancer cells and stromal cells. Although a growing body of evidence suggests the involvement of phospholipases in these processes, their exact role in specific cells is not yet clear.

### PLA

The PLA family may promote tumour progression by providing extracellular regulation of the tumour microenvironment to trigger cell migration and invasion. The lipid products of PLAs involved in tumour progression are LPA, AA, leukotrienes and prostaglandins ${}^{66,67}$. In the tumour microenvironment, LPA generation can be mediated by PLA1 (phosphatidylserine-PLA1 and membrane-associated phosphatidic acid-selective PLA1 (mPA-PLA1)), PLA2 (sPLA2-IIA) and autotaxin (also known as ENPP2 and lysoPLD). Serum LPA is a well-established indicator of tumour initiation and progression in breast cancer ${}^{68}$, ovarian cancer ${}^{69}$ and multiple myeloma ${}^{70}$. LPA receptors, which have deregulated expression in cancer cells and tissues ${}^{71-73}$, activate RHO family small GTPases to drive cell migration and invasion ${}^{74}$. The altered metabolism of AA by COX and LOX in cancer cells has also been shown to have a role in cancer progression. The resulting pro-inflammatory prostaglandins and leukotrienes are key mediators in intercellular crosstalk between tumour cells and stromal cells and they induce the migration and proliferation of stromal cells such as immune cells, tumour-associated fibroblasts and endothelial cells ${}^{75}$, which produce additional inflammatory cytokines and chemokines to establish the tumour microenvironment ${}^{76}$. These cytokines activate multiple signalling pathways in tumour cells to activate nuclear factor-$\kappa$B (NF-$\kappa$B) ${}^{77}$, STAT3 (REF. 78), JUN ${}^{79}$ and hypoxia-inducible factor 1$\alpha$ (HIF1$\alpha$) ${}^{80}$, which mediate invasion and metastasis.

PLC. Several studies have implicated PLCγ1 as a regulator of cancer cell invasion and metastasis via multiple mechanisms. Activation of PLCγ1 in response to growth factors is required for cell motility through the regulation of cofilin via PtdIns(4,5)P₂ hydrolysis to locally polymerize actin 81,82 and the regulation of RAC1 and CDC42 GTPases via IP₃-induced calcium release 83. PLCγ1 can associate with large complexes containing the GPCR kinase interacting ARF-GAP1 (GIT1) and the RAC1 and CDC42 GEF Beta-Pix (also known as ARHGEF7), which subsequently leads to the activation of the RHO family GTPases CDC42 and RAC1, as well as calpains, to induce cell spreading and motility 83. Downregulation of PLCγ1 expression severely impairs the activation of RAC, as well as cell invasion in breast cancer, glioblastoma, and head and neck cancer cell lines 84,85. Furthermore, experimental metastasis assays (tail-vein injection of cells in nude mice) have shown that the inducible knockdown of PLCγ1 strongly inhibits the initial development of lung metastases derived from MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells and reduces the size of preformed metastases 84. PLCβ isozymes can be activated by GPCRs, which means that most chemokines secreted in the tumour microenvironment can activate PLCβ to

increase cell migration and invasion; indeed gain-of-function and loss-of-function studies in tumour cells have demonstrated the functional importance of PLCβ in tumour cell migration and invasion 86. Recently, increased expression of PLCβ2 was demonstrated in invasive breast cancer and correlated with a poor prognosis 86,87 (TABLE 2).

PLD. PLD activity may also have an important role in cell motility and migration by the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. PLD2 stimulates cell protrusion in v-src-transformed cells and is required for EGF-induced membrane ruffling 88. Elevated phosphatidic acid levels, produced by PLD, can reorganize actin by its regulation of RAC 89 complexes and phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase (PIP5K) 90. In addition to lipid-mediated activation of downstream effectors, the PX domain of PLD2 contains RHO GEF activity, which induces actin reorganization 25. Thus, PLD2 induces stress fibre formation by mediating nucleotide exchange for RHOA. PLD1 has also been reported to be required for the secretion of MMP9 by colorectal cancer cells 91, and overexpression of PLD1 or PLD2 was required for MMP2 secretion and glioma cell invasion 92. Furthermore, increased PLD activity enhanced the ability of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells to migrate and invade Matrigel 93, and the overexpression of PLD2 increased the invasion and metastasis of EL4 mouse lymphoma cells, whereas inactive PLD2 inhibited metastasis in a syngeneic mouse model 94.

A multicellular phospholipase network. Invasion and metastasis comprise a multicellular and multistep process, and phospholipases contribute to this process by affecting both intercellular and intracellular signalling. First, overexpressed PLA2 and eicosanoid metabolic enzymes generate prostaglandins and leukotrienes, which can activate stromal cells to migrate towards tumour cells. The recruited stromal cells secrete growth factors, cytokines, chemokines and eicosanoids that coordinate the tumour microenvironment. Second, factors that are secreted from stromal cells probably go on to potentiate tumour cell migration and invasion through the activation of PLC and PLD (FIG. 3), as well as many other factors. This suggests that the phospholipase signalling circuit could have crucial intracellular and intercellular roles during metastasis. However, further investigation is needed to fully understand the role or roles of phospholipases in the context of a multicellular network.

Phospholipases in angiogenesis Neovascularization is a key feature of malignant tumours and is dependent on communication between cancer cells and surrounding endothelial cells. The major inducer of tumour angiogenesis is VEGFA, which signals by binding to the VEGF receptor (VEGFR) tyrosine kinases VEGFR1 and VEGFR2. Among them, VEGFR2 (also known as KDR and FLK1) is the major signal transducer for angiogenesis. VEGFR2 primarily activates the PLCγ–PKC pathway to activate MAPK and DNA synthesis in endothelial cells, leading to endothelial cell proliferation and migration 95. In several studies, Plcg1-knockout mice died at early embryonic stages owing to impaired vasculogenesis and erythropoiesis 33,96,97 (Supplementary information S1 (table)). To induce angiogenesis, PLCγ transduces signals to the downstream PKC–RAF–MEK–MAPK pathway by binding to phosphorylated Y1173 on VEGFR2 (REF. 98). Vegfr2-knock-in mice, with a mutation at Y1173, also show early embryonic lethality owing to impaired vasculogenesis 99. These phenotypes are similar to those of VEGFR2-deficient mice 100. Other PLC isotypes have also been implicated in angiogenesis. Knock down of PLCβ in human umbilical vein endothelial

cells (HUVECs) inhibits migration and increases proliferation<sup>101</sup>. Plcd1 and Plcd3 double-knockout mice also show early embryonic lethality owing to impaired placental vascularization<sup>102</sup>.

The functional importance of PLD in angiogenesis has been suggested by the zebrafish model<sup>103</sup>. Inhibition of PLD1 expression using antisense morpholino oligonucleotides impairs intersegmental vessel (ISV) development. Phosphatidic acid, the main product of PLD, produces S1P by binding to sphingosine kinase. S1P then induces angiogenesis by promoting the migration and survival of endothelial cells<sup>104,105</sup>. VEGFR2 and PLD2 are colocalized in endothelial caveolae to mediate VEGF-induced MAPK activation<sup>28</sup>, and VEGF also stimulates PLD activation in a PKC-dependent manner<sup>106</sup>. These findings implicate PLD not only in the generation of angiogenic ligands in cancer cells, but also in endothelial cell proliferation and migration.

The cooperation of phospholipases is important for angiogenesis because cell–cell communication must be tightly integrated and regulated. Malignant tumour cells express high levels of PLA2 and AA metabolic enzymes, which results in the production of eicosanoid metabolites. These molecules mediate endothelial cell recruitment, proliferation, migration and tube formation<sup>76</sup>. Various studies have shown a correlation between COX2 overexpression and enhanced production of PGE2 by cancer cells. Through autocrine and paracrine pathways in tumour cells and stromal cells, PGE2 stimulates the production of VEGF<sup>107</sup> and the chemokine CXCL1 (REF. 108) to recruit endothelial cells. Moreover, cPLA2α has been implicated in the survival, growth, migration and tube formation of endothelial cells, as well as tumour angiogenesis<sup>109–112</sup>. A recent study demonstrated that cPLA2α-deficient endothelial cells are defective in tumour vascularization<sup>113</sup> (TABLE 1).

Although many reports have suggested the functional association of phospholipases in physiological angiogenesis, the precise mechanism in tumour-associated angiogenesis remains unclear. The majority of such studies have used *in vitro* experiments, which do not consider the tumour microenvironment or cell–cell communication (FIG. 3). As noted above, tumour microenvironments are complex and dynamically regulated by intercellular signalling events. Therefore, more sophisticated experimental systems that include tumour cells, stromal

Figure 3 | **The role of phospholipases in tumorigenesis.** Tumorigenesis is a multicellular process, in which phospholipases coordinate both intercellular and intracellular signalling. In tumour cells, secretory phospholipase A2 (sPLA2) and autotoxin (lysoPLD) generate lysophosphatidic acid (LPA). In tumour cells, overexpressed PLA2 and eicosanoid metabolic enzymes generate prostaglandins (PGs) and leukotrienes (LTs), which activate stromal cells to induce stromal cell migration towards tumour cells. These recruited stromal cells, such as immune cells, cancer-associated fibroblasts and endothelial cells, secrete growth factors (for example, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)), cytokines and chemokines, which coordinate the tumour microenvironment. Secreted eicosanoids induce tumour growth and metastasis in an autocrine and a paracrine manner. Secreted factors from stromal cells also potentiate tumour cell proliferation, migration and invasion, in part by activating matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). During this process, phospholipases integrate and amplify extracellular cues by activating various signalling pathways, such as Janus kinase (JAK)–signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT), MAPK and mTOR. Secreted VEGF and chemokines also activate intracellular signalling of endothelial cells through the regulation of PLCγ and PLD, activating the migration and proliferation of endothelial cells for angiogenesis.

cells and endothelial cells, and animal models that knock out phospholipases in a cell type-specific manner are needed.

### Phospholipases as anticancer drug targets

Despite strong implications for the role of phospholipases during tumorigenesis, developing effective therapeutic strategies for inhibiting phospholipases has been difficult for a number of reasons. First, some of the phospholipases such as calcium-independent PLA2s (iPLA2s) are known to be housekeeping enzymes that control normal functions of the brain and heart by remodelling phospholipids<sup>114,115</sup>. However, compared with normal regulation of phospholipases, tumour-associated phospholipases have upregulated expression or activation by oncogenes. This indicates that hyper-activity, which is generated by the deregulation of phospholipases, might be the best target for anticancer drugs. Therefore, if we can find the right dosage or schedule of anti-phospholipase drug, there might be a therapeutic window in which side effects are minimized and anticancer effects are maximized. Furthermore, owing to their ‘double-sided’ nature some phospholipase isoforms have oncogenic roles and others have tumour-suppressive roles, depending on the environmental cues (noted above). Therefore, the generation of isozyme-specific inhibitors might improve our ability to target these enzymes. Second, although

many reports have addressed the prognostic value of phospholipases in different tumour types, the number of studies has been small and detection methods have been limited. To evaluate the clinical value of targeting phospholipases as anticancer therapy, we need more careful clinical study. Third, no mutations that constitutively activate the phospholipases in specific tumour tissues have been identified, and few spontaneous animal models for tumours have been developed. In other words, we cannot find any mutation in phospholipases that can drive tumorigenesis, which means that phospholipases might not be master regulators but might instead be modulators of tumorigenesis. Last, because lipid second messengers generated by phospholipases are quickly converted to the next metabolite, it has been impossible to measure the activation status of phospholipases in cancer tissue. Moreover, downstream targets of lipid mediators are not specific to phospholipase-mediated signalling. Therefore, the identification of predictive biomarkers is crucial for drug development.

Although phospholipases themselves are not strong oncogenes or tumour suppressors, a variety of oncogenes and tumour suppressors interact with phospholipases and their lipid mediators. Furthermore, phospholipases can exhibit context-dependent activities in particular microenvironments or cell types, implying the possibility that specific drugs could be designed to target tumour-associated phospholipases. Although few phospholipase-targeting studies have been reported, there have been some research advances on this topic. The blocking of eicosanoid production through the deactivation of COX enzymes has been tested in clinical studies. The inhibition of COX enzymes using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) has therapeutic effects on several tumours<sup>116</sup>. However, their therapeutic efficacy is insufficient<sup>117</sup> because NSAIDs cannot block the generation of leukotrienes by PLA2. Therefore, the use of PLA2 inhibitors might be considered an attractive alternative. Varespladib, a sPLA2-specific inhibitor, has been under clinical evaluation as an anti-inflammatory agent; however, inhibitors for other PLA2 isozymes have not yet been developed and tested as anticancer drugs<sup>118</sup>. Future development of isozyme-specific inhibitors of PLA2 might generate novel therapeutic strategies.

An attempt to develop PLD inhibitors has recently been launched. The pan-PLD inhibitor 5-fluoro-2-indoly des-chlorohalopemide (FIPI) effectively blocks *in vivo* phosphatidic acid production and several biological

processes that have been known to be mediated by PLD activation, such as cytoskeleton reorganization, cell spreading and chemotaxis<sup>119</sup>. Furthermore, isozyme-selective inhibitors of PLD have been generated that inhibited the migration of breast cancer cell lines<sup>120</sup>. Although these chemicals have demonstrated effective inhibition *in vitro* and in cell line assays, further experiments will be required for clinical applications in animal models.

One of the key points of this article is that interacting partners of phospholipases and their lipid mediators may determine the role of phospholipases during tumorigenesis. For example, PLCγ1 interacting with SOS1 activates RAS to increase cell proliferation<sup>34</sup>, and PLCγ1 induces cell migration by interaction with the GIT1–Beta-Pix complex<sup>83</sup>. These interactions are mediated by specific motifs and domains, suggesting the possibility that interaction blockers could be used as more specific anticancer therapies. However, these have not yet been developed.

Although some reagents that can block phospholipase signalling are available, we are far from developing anticancer therapies. By using integrated information and animal experiments, the functional roles and regulatory mechanism of phospholipases in tumorigenesis will be further defined. These efforts may lead to the generation of phospholipase-specific anticancer therapies.

### Conclusions and perspectives

Many studies have suggested that phospholipases can regulate pathways that are involved in tumorigenesis. Although signalling mechanisms of each phospholipase have been fairly well established, the functional roles of phospholipases in tumorigenesis are poorly understood. One of the major challenges in addressing this knowledge gap is the complexity of tumour microenvironments and intracellular signalling pathways. Tumour microenvironments generate various extracellular cues, which can trigger multiple signalling pathways, and different phospholipases can be simultaneously activated in this context. Furthermore, phospholipases distributed through the signalling network can crosstalk with one another and regulate each other’s activities. Therefore, it may be helpful to understand the phospholipase network within tumour microenvironments to evaluate their functional importance in tumorigenesis. As shown in FIG. 2, phospholipases and their lipid mediators induce both hierarchical pathways, as well as multilayered, complex networks that have feedback loops and crosstalk among them. For example, PLC is located in the immediate vicinity of signal transduction receptors and generates two major second messengers (DAG and IP₃) on activation. Thus, we would like to suggest that PLC serves as an ‘early generator’ of second messengers, which functions during the early stages of signal transduction. In addition, phosphatidic acid and PLD comprise a complex network with a variety of binding partners, and they have dynamic interrelationships with their binding partners that can in turn simultaneously or sequentially interact<sup>31</sup>. Hence, we suggest PLD as a ‘signalling coordinator’ that can finely regulate multiple signals as they pass downstream. PLAs generate LPA, an extracellular ligand for receptors, and AA, the intracellular precursor of extracellular prostaglandin and leukotriene ligands. On the basis of these characteristics we suggest PLA2 as a ‘signalling propagator’ that can transmit signals into the extracellular environment in an autocrine and/or a paracrine manner. From the spatiotemporal point of view, these signalling concepts of phospholipases are supported by the localization of phospholipase binding partners, as well as the localization of the phospholipases themselves (Supplementary information S2,S3,S4 (box, figure, table)).

Despite evidence demonstrating the involvement of phospholipases in tumour-associated signalling in cells, there are few clinical studies presenting phospholipases as oncogenes or tumour suppressors. However, many data sets have recently been made available, including those derived from genome and transcriptome data, as well as interactomes of phospholipases. These data can be used to assess the overall involvement of phospholipases in cancer. Our preliminary analyses of these data sets indicate potential associations of phospholipases with cancer: phospholipases can activate cancer-associated signalling pathways — RTK, GPCR and MAPK pathways — through their interactions with signalling molecules (Supplementary information S2,S3 (box, figure)); the expression of many phospholipases and their interactors are significantly changed in tumours (Supplementary information S2,S5,S6 (box, figures)); and phospholipases can affect cancer-associated cellular processes in cancer networks, including proliferation, migration, angiogenesis and inflammation (Supplementary information S2,S3,S7 (box, figures)). Although these preliminary analyses do not indicate any specific connection of phospholipases and their lipid mediators to cellular processes in cancer, their dense connections to cancer-associated processes

hint at the potential roles of phospholipases in tumorigenesis. We predict that a variety of oncogenes and tumour suppressors are interactors and effectors of phospholipases (Supplementary information S2,S7 (box, figure). These speculations suggest that phospholipases might function as modulators of tumour signalling by interacting with many tumour-related signalling pathways. Interestingly, most experimental animal tumour models of phospholipases are not established by single knockout or the overexpression of a single phospholipase molecule but rather by a combination of knockout or transgenic animals expressing different oncogenes or tumour suppressors. These results suggest that drugs that target phospholipases might be effective when combined with other drugs that target different cellular signalling pathways. It is possible that inhibitors of phospholipases could be developed to improve the efficacy of other targeted therapies, and to diminish toxicities resulting from the inhibition of a physiologically important housekeeping enzyme.

Although many important questions remain regarding the development of isozyme-specific inhibitors or the design of interaction blockers, we believe that phospholipases are attractive targets in anticancer therapy. The challenges for the future will be elucidating the complexity and variability of the phospholipase network in the tumour microenvironment, and understanding the tumour-specific role of each phospholipase and its corresponding regulatory mechanism or mechanisms.
