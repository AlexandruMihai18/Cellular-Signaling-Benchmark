## Abstract

Sir2/Sirt1, a mediator of longevity in several animal models, is a member of the sirtuin family of type III histone deacetylases. Its non-histone substrates include a group of regulatory molecules that modulate energy metabolism, such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-$\gamma$ (PPAR$\gamma$), and its transcriptional coactivator, PPAR$\gamma$ coactivator-1$\alpha$ (PGC-1$\alpha$). Sirt1’s activity on these substrates may underlie its connection with the metabolic changes brought about by caloric restriction (CR). Recent studies have elucidated new substrates for Sirt1 that are involved in metabolic regulation, and have further delineated Sirt1’s functional associations with other metabolic regulators like AMP-activated kinase (AMPK). Perplexingly, manipulations that either increase or decrease Sirt1 activity have both been associated with a beneficial effect in animal models of ageing-associated disorders, such as neurodegenerative diseases. Sirt1’s activation patterns and roles in energy metabolism appear to have tissue-specific differences. A deeper understanding of the mechanistic underpinnings of Sirt1’s metabolic functions is necessary to effectively design Sirt1-based therapeutic interventions for metabolic disorders.

## Introduction

Caloric restriction (CR), a moderate reduction of caloric intake without malnutrition, has been consistently implicated in extension of lifespan across a wide evolutionary spectrum. In mammals, CR also clearly attenuates symptoms of ageing-associated obesity, insulin resistance, hypertension, and atherosclerosis. A connection between CR and Sir2/Sirt1, an evolutionarily conserved longevity-related gene, is of particular interest. Sirt1 and other members of the sirtuin family are nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)-dependent class III histone deacetylases [1,2], but also have many non-histone targets. Their unusual deacetylation reaction is coupled to cleavage of NAD into nicotinamide and 1-O-acetyl-ADP ribose [3]. The activity of sirtuins is therefore dependent on the level of NAD, and inhibited by the product nicotinamide. It is thus influenced by the cell’s metabolic status.

Over-expression of Sir2 extended the replicative lifespan of yeast, and over-expression or activation of Sir2 orthologs with resveratrol was shown to increase lifespan in invertebrates like *Caenorhabditis elegans* and *Drosophila* [4–6]. The mammalian genome harbors seven sirtuin paralogs (Sirt1–7), with Sirt1 bearing the most homology to yeast Sir2 [7]. With the discoveries of its non-histone substrates, Sirt1 has been linked to multiple physiological functions and pathological roles. For example, Sirt1’s deacetylation of members of the forkhead box class O (FOXO) family [8], p53 tumor suppressor [9], and nuclear factor $\kappa$B (NF-$\kappa$B) [10] regulates key aspects of cellular stress response and survival. Sirt1’s activity on PPAR$\gamma$ [11] and its transcriptional coactivator PGC-1$\alpha$ [12,13] also regulates a wide range of metabolic activities in skeletal muscle, adipose tissues, and the liver [14,15]. These links between nutrient availability/energy metabolism and adaptive changes in transcriptional profiles have implications on multiple aspects of human ageing and related diseases [16,17].

Evidence for Sirt1 being a longevity factor in mammals has been controversial, as Sirt1 appears to have both pro- and anti-ageing activities [18]. However, Sirt1 is still likely to be a key mediator of some beneficial CR-associated metabolic effects [19]. A perplexing aspect of Sirt1 is that both its activation and inhibition have been shown to be beneficial in diseases and disorders. For example, Sirt1 activation has been shown to alleviate symptoms of neurodegenerative diseases in several animal models [20–22]. However, nicotinamide and other Sirt1 inhibitors are also known to be neuroprotective in animal models of brain ischemia, Parkinsonism, and Alzheimer’s disease [23–26]. Transgenic over-expression of Sir2 ortholog in *Drosophila* promotes apoptosis [27], while reduction of Sir2 activity improves neuronal survival in flies expressing the neurodegenerative mutant Huntingtin [28]. Another recent report showed that Sirt1 inhibitors or a knockout of *Sirt1* protected neurons from oxidative damage [29]. Similarly, Sirt1 may either be oncogenic or tumor suppressive depending on the type of malignancy and context of analysis [30,31]. Recent advances have also revealed that pharmacological or genetic activation of Sirt1 results in metabolic benefits that mimic the effects of CR. However, gen-

eral and conditional knockout of Sirt1 in mice have also resulted in improved glucose and lipid homeostasis. In the ensuing paragraphs, we follow these recent findings and discuss the implications of some apparently paradoxical results.

### Sirt1’s substrates and collaborators in energy metabolism—old and new connections

Sirt1 has a wide range of substrates, and several of these participate in energy regulation in metabolically active tissues such as liver and muscle [14,32,33]. Among these is the Sirt1-PGC-1α axis in liver glucose metabolism [13]. Gluconeogenesis during starvation can be triggered by the hormone glucagon, which induces dephosphorylation and nuclear translocation of transducer of regulated CREB activity 2 (TORC2). TORC2 binds to and activates the DNA-binding transcription factor Cre binding protein (CREB), which then induces the expression of the transcriptional coactivator PGC-1α. The latter complexes with, and coactivates, transcription factors that include PPARα, FOXO1, glucocorticoid receptor (GR), and hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (HNF4α). These in turn induce the transcription of key gluconeogenic genes encoding the rate-limiting enzymes phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and glucose-6-phosphatase (see Fig. 1). In the fed state, insulin-stimulated Akt kinase activity results in phosphorylation of both TORC2 and PGC-1α, thereby shutting down the transcription of gluconeogenic genes. Under conditions of stress and low levels of cellular ATP (an-

other key sensor of metabolic status), the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is activated. AMPK activates catabolic, ATP-generating pathways and shuts down anabolic, energy-consuming ones by phosphorylation of metabolic enzymes. It also exerts long-term effects at the transcription level by phosphorylating transcription factors [34]. In the liver, AMPK inhibits gluconeogenesis by phosphorylating TORC2 [35], thereby safeguarding hepatic cellular ATP needs. AMPK activation is a key pharmacological role of drugs for type II diabetes which work to suppress hepatic glucose output, such as Metformin [36,37].

Besides phosphorylation, PGC-1α is also regulated by acetylation and deacetylation. Its transcription-activating ability is repressed by acetylation through the acetyl transferase GCN5 [38] and activated by Sirt1-mediated deacetylation [13,39]. Notably, this parallel regulation of gluconeogenesis via PGC-1α activity is not dependent on glucagon or glucocorticoids, but on the levels of metabolic intermediates like pyruvate and NAD [39]. In this connection, several recent findings are noteworthy. Sirt1 may also affect gluconeogenic activity through PGC-1α in an indirect manner. In the liver, STAT3 is known to suppress the expression of PGC-1α and gluconeogenic gene expression. Regulation of gluconeogenesis by STAT3 could be linked to nutritional status via Sirt1, which can directly deacetylate and attenuate the anti-gluconeogenic transcriptional activity of STAT3 [40]. It also turns out that TORC2 is itself regulated by Sirt1 deacetylation [41]. Lys628 acetylation prevents ubiquitination and degradation of glucagon-activated TORC2 during the early stage of fasting. At a later stage, however, Sirt1 activity reduces TORC2 levels.

Fig. 1. A simplified schematic diagram of how Sirt1, activated by NAD status, CR or pharmacological means, may regulate PGC-1α activity and the expression of key gluconeogenic enzymes—phosphoenol pyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase). This regulation intersects with hormonal regulation of gluconeogenesis in the liver by pancreatic insulin and glucagon. Sirt1 activation, deacetylation and hormonal influences on phosphorylation are indicated by arrows with dotted lines. For simplicity, several transcriptional components (see text) are not shown. In the fed state, insulin signaling stimulates kinase activities that phosphorylate TORC2 and PGC-1α, while glucagon signaling reverses these phosphorylations during starvation. Deacetylation of PGC-1α by Sirt1 is known to be the parallel pathway for cells to activate gluconeogenesis independently of glucagon. TORC2 has also recently been shown to be deacetylated by Sirt1 (leading to its ubiquitination and degradation), thereby providing, under conditions of prolonged starvation, a switch away from the control of gluconeogenesis by glucagon.
by deacetylation, but sustains gluconeogenesis via deacetylation and activation of FOXO1. Gluconeogenesis during prolonged starvation therefore switches from hormonal regulation by glucagon to one that is regulated by a stress-response network, presumably with better maintenance of energy balance.

Sirt1 activation of PGC-1α in liver cells appears to counteract that of AMPK, which phosphorylates and inactivates the transcription coactivator. Indeed, while AMPK activation inhibits hepatic glucose output, Sirt1 activation leads to increased hepatic gluconeogenesis. The relationship between Sirt1 and AMPK is, however, different in the skeletal muscle, the major energy-consuming organ in a physically active mammal. Activation of AMPK in skeletal muscle increases fatty acid oxidation through enhanced transcription of both PPARα [42,43] and PGC-1α [44], or via direct phosphorylation of PGC-1α [45]. Sirt1 deacetylation also activates PGC-1α in muscles, and this is apparently the way by which Sirt1 activates mitochondrial activity and fatty acid oxidation in muscle cells [46]. AMPK and Sirt1 therefore act in a coordinated manner in this tissue. Recent findings also indicate that (in muscles at least) AMPK may also activate PGC-1α indirectly via Sirt1 activation, through increasing cellular NAD levels [47].

In pancreatic β cells, Sirt1 enhances insulin secretion [48], partly through the suppression of uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) [49]. On the other hand, AMPK activation by pharmacological or genetic means blocks glucose-stimulated insulin secretion [50].

These highly-simplified descriptions of Sirt1’s regulatory activity in metabolically active tissues show that systemic Sirt1-based therapeutic manipulations would result in different responses in different tissues. This will then go onto exert different degrees of impact on the body’s metabolic balance. Whether metabolic dysfunction could be corrected or improved would then depend on the sum of these responses. A closer look at Sirt1’s metabolic functions, investigated via pharmacological and genetic manipulations in mouse models, is made in the following paragraphs.

### Investigation of Sirt1’s metabolic function by genetic manipulations of Sirt1 levels

The first Sir2/Sirt1 gene knockout studies indicated that CR response is blunted in the absence of Sir2/Sirt1. Sirt1 deficiency on its own results in developmental defects and metabolic dysfunctions [60–63]. Phenotypes associated with the effect of CR in mice, such as the increase in physical activity and motor capacity, requires functional Sirt1 [64]. Interestingly, Sirt1 deficiency appears to result in increased insulin sensitivity and lower blood glucose levels. One possible reason for this is the alleviation of UCP2 repression by Sirt1 in pancreatic β cells. In support of this, Sirt1 knockout mice display constitutively high UCP2 expression [49].

Consistent with Sirt1’s activation of PGC-1α and gluconeogenesis, knockdown of Sirt1 in liver by small hairpin RNA (shRNA) lowers blood glucose in normal and fasted diabetic db/db mice that lack the leptin receptor [65]. Likewise, hepatic Sirt1 knockdown with antisense oligonucleotides in a rat model of type II diabetes lowers fasting hyperglycemia [66]. This beneficial effect on glucose homeostasis resulting from Sirt1 deficiency appears to contradict the general beneficial effect of Sirt1 activation. Interestingly, it was recently shown that, unlike other tissues, Sirt1 activity in liver is in fact reduced by CR (and activated by a high calorie diet) [67]. The reason for this anomalous regulation of Sirt1 activity by CR in liver is unclear. On the other hand, liver-specific conditional Sirt1 knockout mice have impaired lipid metabolism [68]. They exhibit defective PPARα signaling, hepatic steatosis and liver inflammation that was easily precipitated by a high-fat diet.

Genetic gain-of-function manipulations of Sirt1 levels have generally produced beneficial outcomes, although the phenotypes observed in different settings were not exactly identical. Sirt1 transgenic mice bearing a hemizygous knockin at the β-actin locus are leaner, metabolically more active, and have a CR-like blood glucose and lipid profile [69]. Mice carrying a bacterial artificial chromosome with Sirt1 under its own promoter have moderate overexpression of Sirt1, with no alterations in body weight/fat mass, and are protected from metabolic disorders induced by a chronic high-fat diet [70]. In another report using a similar transgenic approach, however, mice exhibited decrease in food intake and locomotor activity. In any case though, they also exhibited improved glucose tolerance as a result of decreased glucose production by the liver and increased adiponectin levels [71]. As alluded to above, specific expression of Sirt1 in pancreatic β cells enhanced insulin secretion and improved glucose tolerance [48]. Transgenic expression of Sirt1 in endothelial cells reduced atherosclerotic lesions in apolipoprotein E null mice, although blood glucose and lipid levels in these were not significantly different from control [72].

On the whole, therefore, moderate transgenic over-expression of Sirt1 phenocopies systemic Sirt1 activation by pharmacological activators, in terms of metabolic benefits. Although Sirt1 overexpression in liver could potentially elevate hepatic glucose output by activating PGC-1α, this has not been observed. One possible reason is that Sirt1’s deacetylation and downregulation of TORC2 effectively attenuated glucagon-induced gluconeogenesis [41]. It also appears that a generalized elevation of Sirt1 activity in multiple tissues attains a net result of improved glucose homeostasis.

### Investigation of Sirt1’s metabolic functions by pharmacological activators and inhibitors

A potent and classical inhibitor of Sirt1 is the plant polyphenol resveratrol (3,5,4′-trihydroxystilbene) [51], which was already known to be an antioxidant. Its purported anti-ageing efficacy received a greater boost with the demonstration that it could extend the replicative lifespan of yeast, worms, and flies in a manner concomitant with, and dependent on, Sir2 activation [6,52]. Several recent studies have now expanded this observation to mammalian models. Resveratrol administration was shown to elevate AMPK and PGC-1α activity as well as mitochondrion number, and generally improved the health, motor function and survival of middle-age (1 year old) mice on a high calorie diet [53]. Young (4–8 weeks old) mice on a high-fat diet were protected from the development of insulin resistance and obesity, with increased mitochondrial biogenesis and capacity for aerobic metabolism [54]. Several reports have also shown that resveratrol alleviates both alcoholic and non-alcoholic liver steatosis (fatty liver) [55,56]. Despite the obvious beneficial effects of resveratrol in animal models, whether effective in vivo concentrations could be achieved for significant Sirt1 activation remains unclear. An explanation of the beneficial effects of resveratrol is also complicated by the fact that it could activate AMPK independently of Sirt1 [57], which has overlapping effects with Sirt1 activation.

More specific and potent Sirt1 small-molecule activators have now been identified and shown to be therapeutically effective in an animal model of type II diabetes. The animals showed improved glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity in liver, adipose tissue and skeletal muscle, as well as enhanced
Concluding remarks

The discussions above highlight some differences in the activities of Sirt1 in metabolically active tissues. Indeed, Sirt1 has a wide range of substrates and subcellular expressions. It affects the expression of gene networks through deacetylation of transcription factors, and epigenetic histone modifications. A general and systemic elevation of Sirt1 activity, by both pharmacological and genetic interventions in experimental animals, appears consensually supportive of a beneficial effect on age-related metabolic disorders. However, several potential caveats need to be kept in mind. Firstly, widespread Sirt1 activation in all human tissues may not completely mimic CR—at the very least, the effect of Sirt1 elevation in liver gluconeogenesis warrants further investigation. Specifically, in the case of type II diabetes, potential elevation rather than suppression of hepatic glucose output could nullify all other benefits on metabolic balance. Secondly, it has been cautioned that the CR state may compromise immune responses to infection and increase frailty to infectious pathogens [73]. Especially for those with natural or acquired immune deficiencies, one would think that Sirt1's attenuation of NF-κB activity would further increase risks of infection. Thirdly, Sirt1 activation may not be beneficial, and could in fact exacerbate or worsen certain neurodegenerative disorders, and in some organs may promote oncogenesis.

It is clear that we are only beginning to understand the elaborate role that Sirt1 plays in metabolic regulation. New activities and substrates of Sirt1 continue to be revealed at an amazing rate. A particularly exciting series of new findings have revealed that the core circadian rhythm regulator protein circadian locomotor output cycles kaput (CLOCK) is a histone acetyltransferase, and its activity is counterbalanced by NAD and Sirt1. As the circadian rhythm modulates metabolic activities on a long-term basis, the cumulative effects of systemic Sirt1 activation over time should therefore be investigated.
