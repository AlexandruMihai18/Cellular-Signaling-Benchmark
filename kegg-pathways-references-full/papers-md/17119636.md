The 2-deoxystreptamine-containing aminoglycosides are an important class of clinically valuable antibiotics. A deep understanding of the biosynthesis of these natural products is required to enable efforts to rationally manipulate and engineer the biological production of novel aminoglycosides. This review discusses the development of our biosynthetic knowledge over the past half-century, with emphasis on the relatively recent contributions of molecular biology to the elucidation of these biosynthetic pathways.

### 1 Introduction

The first aminoglycoside antibiotic, streptomycin, was isolated from *Streptomyces griseus* by Waksman in 1943. The discovery occasioned great excitement in the medical community, as streptomycin exhibited a broad spectrum of activity, particularly against Gram-negative bacteria, which are poorly susceptible to penicillins and sulfonamides, as well as the first significant potency towards *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*, the pathogen which causes tuberculosis. The discovery of streptomycin encouraged the pursuit of similar compounds, first in other species of *Streptomyces*, then in *Micromonospora* and *Bacillus*, leading to the discovery of the neomycins,² paromomycins,³ kanamycins,⁴ gentamicins,⁵ and several others in the aminoglycoside family (Scheme 1).

Clinically, aminoglycosides are generally used for specialised purposes, not as drugs of first resort. Aminoglycosides are not absorbed through the intestinal lining, and orally-administered aminoglycosides are excreted unaltered in the faeces. This property

Structurally, aminoglycosides contain a characteristic core aminocyclitol moiety, usually streptamine, streptidine, or 2-deoxystreptamine (2-DOS), which is elaborated with one or more aminosugar units. Aminoglycosides act by associating with the bacterial 30S ribosomal subunit and inhibiting protein synthesis via interference with initiation, codon fidelity, and translocation.⁷⁸ Aminoglycoside antibiotics are bactericidal, meaning that they actively kill bacteria, unlike bacteriostatic antibiotics that only inhibit bacterial growth, leaving the destruction of the pathogen up to the host's native defence mechanisms. When used properly, bactericidal agents tend to discourage the proliferation of resistance, as the drug kills nearly all bacterial cells, leaving the relatively few resistant cells to be destroyed by the host immune system.⁹ In contrast, bacteriostatic agents require the host immune system to kill all bacterial cells, resistant or not, giving resistant cells greater opportunity to multiply. This bactericidal property makes aminoglycosides desirable antibiotic agents, particularly in synergistic use with bacteriostatic antibiotics. The co-administration of β-lactams with aminoglycosides, for example, is useful, as the weakening of the cell wall by the action of the β-lactam facilitates the penetration of the bactericidal aminoglycoside into the cell. Recently, the ability of aminoglycosides to induce the loss of plasmid-mediated resistance in bacteria has been reported, raising the possibility of a new mode of antibacterial therapy for this class of drugs.¹⁰ In addition to their well-established antibacterial activity, aminoglycosides also show promising potential as leads towards antiviral agents, as evidenced by their activity against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)¹¹,¹² as well as catalytic RNAs¹³ including the group I intron, the hammerhead ribozyme, and the hepatitis delta virus (HDV) ribozyme. These anti-viral and anti-RNA activities have fuelled renewed interest in this class of drugs.

As for all antibiotics, the continued efficacy of aminoglycosides is threatened by the emergence and proliferation of resistant pathogens.¹⁴,¹⁵ Whilst point-mutation of the 16S rRNA has been observed to confer aminoglycoside resistance in some clinical isolates of *Mycobacteria*,¹⁶,¹⁷ bacterial resistance to aminoglycosides arises most commonly from the expression of aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes that deactivate the drug molecule.¹⁸ Common modifications include acylation of amines and phosphorylation or nucleotidylylation of hydroxyl groups. These modifications weaken the affinity of the drug molecule for the bacterial rRNA, rendering it harmless to the bacterial cell. The circumvention of these resistance mechanisms is clearly an important challenge that must be addressed if the utility of aminoglycoside drugs is to be maintained. To date, this issue has been addressed by the synthetic modification of naturally-occurring aminoglycosides to give more robust drugs such as amikacin, arbekacin, and isepamicin (Scheme 2).¹⁹ The value of these modified aminoglycosides is highlighted by the continuing effectiveness of arbekacin against MRSA despite nearly thirty years of clinical use.²⁰ Whilst the rational design of effective novel aminoglycosides is an interesting emerging field,²¹ engineered biosynthesis of new antibiotics is an attractive alternative. The production of clinically useful antibiotics directly by fermentation could be more efficient, more economical, and more environmentally friendly than synthetic and semisynthetic alternatives. For rational biosynthetic engineering to be possible, however, intensive knowledge of the biosynthesis of aminoglycosides is prerequisite. The purpose of this review is to

makes them useful for treatment of intestinal infections or for sterilisation of intestinal contents prior to surgery. Since they are not orally available, however, they must be administered parenterally for treatment of systemic infections, so they are not generally useful for outpatient therapy beyond some topical applications. Furthermore, systemic treatment with aminoglycosides must be carefully monitored, as these drugs entail a risk of reversible nephrotoxicity and irreversible ototoxicity.⁶ Despite these mitigating factors, aminoglycosides remain an important tool for the treatment of difficult or specialised infections, particularly in the hospital setting.

by degradation of the antibiotic neomycin.²² Its status as an authentic intermediate in aminoglycoside biosynthesis was established by feeding the neomycin producer *Streptomyces fradiae* with ¹⁴C-radiolabelled 2-DOS and by the isolation of mutants of *S. fradiae*, *Streptomyces rimosus*, and *Streptomyces kanamyceticus* which produced antibiotics only in the presence of exogenous 2-DOS and analogues.²³⁻²⁵ Early studies on the incorporation of labelled substrates in neomycin showed that 2-DOS is derived from D-glucose.²⁶ ¹³C NMR of neomycin isolated from cultures of *S. fradiae* grown in the presence of site-specifically ¹³C-enriched D-glucose showed that C-1 of 2-DOS is labelled by [1-¹³C]-D-glucose, whilst C-2 is labelled by [6-¹³C]-D-glucose. Feeding with ¹³C-enriched D-glucosamine also led to labelling of 2-DOS, though with poorer incorporation of the label relative to D-glucose.²⁶ The further observation that the nitrogen of [¹⁵N]-D-glucosamine is not incorporated into 2-DOS confirmed that the observed incorporation of labelled D-glucosamine occurs via metabolic conversion to D-glucose.²⁷

The observed labelling pattern was inconsistent with the previously-described biosynthetic pathway for streptomycin, in which D-glucose is converted to streptidine via a cyclic rearrangement to *myo*-inosose,²⁸ leading Rinehart *et al.* to propose an alternative pathway via a deoxyinosose intermediate.²⁶ Later, 2-deoxy-*scyllo*-inosose (2-DOI) was shown to restore aminoglycoside production to a 2-DOS-idiotrophic mutant of the gentamicin producer *Micromonospora purpurea*, lending support to Rinehart's proposed pathway.²⁹ The conversion of D-glucose to 2-DOI qualitatively resembles the cyclic rearrangement of 3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate-7-phosphate (DAHP) to 5-dehydroquinate (DHQ) in the shikimate pathway for aromatic amino acid biosynthesis (Scheme 4).³⁰,³¹ Further investigation by ²H NMR of ribostamycin from *Streptomyces ribosidificus* found that both of the deuterons in [6-²H₂]-D-glucose are retained in 2-DOS, and that the rearrangement proceeds with retention of stereochemistry.³²,³³ The same result was found by ³H : ¹⁴C ratiometric labelling of neomycin.³⁴ Initially, ratiometric labelling suggested the loss of the C-4 proton of D-glucose in the course of 2-DOS biosynthesis.³⁵,³⁶ The *in vitro* conversion of D-glucose-6-phosphate into 2-DOS was observed in cell-free extracts of *S. fradiae* and was found to be

establish the current level of knowledge regarding the biosynthesis of the 2-DOS antibiotics, the most clinically significant family of aminoglycosides, with emphasis on the current and potential contributions of molecular biology to our understanding of the origins of these valuable drugs.

C-3 leading to 2-DOS (Scheme 3). Alternatively, oxidation of 2-DOI to the symmetrical 1,3-diketone might precede two stepwise transaminations to 2-DOS. In support of the first proposed pathway, exogenous 2-DOIA was found to restore antibiotic production to some butirosin-blocked mutants of *B. circulans*<sup>53</sup>, indicating that transamination of 2-DOI precedes further oxidation. Later, 2-DOS idiophths of *Micromonospora sagamiensis* and *B. circulans* were observed to accumulate 2-DOIA in culture.<sup>54–56</sup> The necessary transamination activity toward 2-DOI was observed directly in crude extracts of antibiotic producers *M. purpurea* and *S. fradiae*, along with indirect evidence of the intermediary of keto-2-deoxy-scyllo-inosamine (keto-2-DOIA), consistent with the transamination-oxidation-transamination pathway.<sup>57</sup> Later, the aminotransferase and NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent dehydrogenase activities were separated in purified extracts of *S. fradiae*.<sup>58</sup> Interestingly, the isolated aminotransferase fractions were active toward both 2-DOI and keto-2-DOIA, suggesting that a single enzyme could be responsible for both transamination steps leading to 2-DOS (or alternatively, that two very similar aminotransferases co-eluted in ion-exchange chromatography). Gene cluster sequencing in *B. circulans* revealed a gene, *btrR*, whose gene product, BtrR<sup>49</sup> (also called BtrS),<sup>50</sup> is homologous to StsC and StsA, the analogous aminotransferases from streptomycin biosynthesis.<sup>59</sup> The purified recombinant enzyme was shown to catalyse the PLP-dependent transamination of 2-DOI to 2-DOIA, proving its involvement in this step of 2-DOS biosynthesis. BtrR was also observed to catalyse the transamination of 2-DOS to keto-2-DOIA, suggesting it is also involved in the final transamination to 2-DOS and supporting the proposal of a dual-function aminotransferase in this pathway.<sup>48,49</sup> The BtrR homologue Neo6 from *S. fradiae* was also shown to carry out both transaminations, providing further support for the proposal of a dual-function aminotransferase in this pathway.<sup>48</sup> BtrR was found to accept both enantiomers of 2-DOI as substrates for transamination to 2-DOIA; however, in the reverse reaction from 2-DOS, BtrR selectively transaminates only the C-1 position.<sup>60</sup> Recently, the crystal structure of BtrR has been solved for both the PLP- and PMP-bound forms of the enzyme, suggesting a recognition motif involving three possible enzyme-substrate hydrogen bonds.<sup>61</sup> Genetic screening for BtrR homologues has led to the identification of a number of aminoglycoside biosynthetic gene clusters,<sup>44,45,51,62</sup> and may prove useful in the discovery of novel aminoglycoside natural products.<sup>63</sup> Finally, the *S. fradiae* gene *neo5* was identified in the neomycin biosynthetic gene cluster as a putative dehydrogenase, and the purified recombinant gene product Neo5 was observed to catalyse the NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent dehydrogenation of 2-DOIA to

keto-2-DOIA, confirming its identity as a 2-DOS biosynthetic enzyme.64 Together, Neo5 and Neo6 are competent to convert 2-DOI to 2-DOS, demonstrating conclusively the dual function of the aminotransferase enzyme and proving that three enzymes are responsible for the biosynthesis of 2-DOS from D-glucose-6-phosphate.

### 2.2 Neamine and paromamine

Neamine is the most advanced common intermediate among the 2-DOS-based aminoglycosides except for paromomycin, which instead contains paromamine. Paromamine and neamine are both known to be authentic, discrete intermediates in aminoglycoside biosynthesis. This order of assembly was first put forth upon the isolation of neamine from fermentations of the neomycin producer *S. fradiae* and the discovery of growth conditions that gave neamine as the major fermentation product.65 This proposal was supported by the observation that a 2-DOS idiophth of the paromomycin producer *S. rimosus* produced neomycin upon supplementation of multiply radiolabelled neamine.66 Furthermore, the ratio of the incorporated radiolabels between the 2-DOS and neosamine C rings was found to be the same in the product neomycin as in the parent neamine, demonstrating that neamine was incorporated intact and not first hydrolysed to 2-DOS and neosamine C. Paromamine and neamine were both found to restore sisomicin production in a 2-DOS idiophth of *Micromonospora inyoensis*, suggesting that the two are joint intermediates, with neamine arising from paromamine.67 Likewise, synthetic 6-deoxyneamine restored antibiotic production to a 2-DOS idiophth of *S. rimosus* whilst 5-O-(β-D-ribosyl)-2,6-dideoxystreptamine (the 6-deoxy analogue of rings II + III of neomycin) did not.68 Again, incorporation of the pseudodisaccharide in both cases was believed to proceed without hydrolysis to 2-DOS due to the observation that other potential pseudo-di- and pseudo-trisaccharide precursors containing 2-DOS did not restore antibiotic production. 2-DOS idiophthic mutants of the butirosin producer *B. circulans* were found to incorporate neamine, paromamine, and 3′,4′-dideoxyneamine into product aminoglycosides, confirming that the same biosynthetic pathway operates in both actinomycetes and bacteria.69

Labelling studies found that the neosamine C ring in the neamine moiety of neomycin is derived from D-glucose, with [6-13C]-D-glucose labelling at C-6 of neosamine.26 [1-13C]-D-glucosamine labels C-1 of the neosamine ring and is incorporated better in neosamine than in the 2-DOS or ribose rings of neomycin, suggesting that D-glucosamine is a more advanced precursor of

neosamine, whilst 2-DOS and ribose are labelled via conversion of D-glucosamine to D-glucose prior to incorporation. Neomycin produced by *S. fradiae* supplemented with [U-14C]6, 6-3H2]-D-glucosamine was found to have half the 3H:14C ratio of the parent compound, suggesting that the 6′-amine is added via a dehydrogenation-transamination sequence.70 Feeding experiments with singly- or doubly-deuterated D-glucose showed by 2H NMR that the pro-(S) hydrogen at C-6 is specifically lost in the elaboration of the neosamine C ring in ribostamycin, confirming the presence of an oxidation-transamination sequence.33 Whilst this experiment did not determine whether the amine is added before or after ligation to 2-DOS, the previous observation that paromamine is converted to authentic sisomicin by *M. inyoensis* would suggest that D-glucosamine is ligated to 4-O of 2-DOS to give paromamine, followed by elaboration to neamine. Thus, the biosynthesis of neamine from 2-DOS requires at minimum a glycosyltransferase, a dehydrogenase, and an aminotransferase (Scheme 5).

**Scheme 5** Biosynthesis of paromamine and neamine.

A putative glycosyltransferase enzyme, BtrM, has been identified in the butirosin biosynthetic gene cluster from *B. circulans*, and homologues have been found in other aminoglycoside producers (Table 2), suggesting that this enzyme catalyses transfer of NDP-D-glucosamine to 2-DOS; however, this enzyme has yet to be isolated and functionally characterised.71 It was originally proposed that TDP-D-glucosamine is synthesised by a putative

The necessary GlcNAc is likely derived from the abundant primary metabolite UDP-GlcNAc. Following the addition of GlcNAc to DOS, the \(N\)-acetyl group is removed by BtrD to give the intermediate paromamine.

Transformation of paromamine to neamine is proposed to occur via sequential oxidation and transamination at C-6'. An appropriate dehydrogenase, Neo11, has been identified in the neomycin biosynthetic gene cluster from *S. fradiae*; the enzyme shares an FAD-associated oxidoreductase domain with choline dehydrogenase and related flavoproteins. \({ }^{48}\) Consistent with this proposal, Neo11 has been shown to catalyse the FAD-dependent oxidation of paromamine. \({ }^{73}\) A transaminase, Neo18, has also been identified in *S. fradiae* that contains a class III aminotransferase domain which is conserved among a number of metabolic aminotransferases, including glutamate-1-semialdehyde aminotransferase, 4-aminobutyrate aminotransferase, and ornithine aminotransferase. \({ }^{49}\) Neo18 deaminates neamine at C-6' and, in conjunction with Neo11, converts paromamine to neamine. \({ }^{73}\) Homologues of these two enzymes are found in other amino-glycoside biosynthetic gene clusters, supporting their involvement in neamine biosynthesis.

### 3 4,5-Disubstituted aminoglycosides

#### 3.1 Ribostamycin, xylostasin, paromomycins, and neomycins

Neomycin, discovered in cultures of *S. fradiae* by Waksman in 1949, was the second isolated aminoglycoside, following streptomycin, and the first of the 2-DOS family. \({ }^{2}\) Later, paromomycin was identified as a product of *S. rimosus*. \({ }^{3}\) Ribostamycin and its epimer, xylostasin, are products of *S. ribosidificus* and *B. circulans*, respectively. \({ }^{74,75}\) The biosyntheses of these aminoglycosides are thought to be broadly the same. This assumption is based on the high structural similarity of these three antibiotics as well as on the observations that 1) paromomycin is a minor fermentation product of the neomycin producer *S. fradiae* and 2) ribostamycin appears, based on mutational studies of *S. fradiae*, to be an intermediate in neomycin biosynthesis. \({ }^{76,77}\) Thus, it is convenient to discuss these three biosynthetic pathways together.

From neamine (or, for paromomycin, paromamine), aminoglycoside biosynthesis is believed to proceed by ribosylation at C-5 of the 2-DOS ring. The ribose subunit of neomycin is labelled specifically at the C-1 position by [1-\(^{14} \mathrm{C}\)]-ribose, indicating that ribose is directly installed onto the intermediate pseudodisaccharide to give ribostamycin (or 6'-deamino-6'-hydroxyribostamycin in paromamine biosynthesis). Comparison of the neomycin biosynthetic gene cluster \({ }^{48}\) with those for ribostamycin \({ }^{44}\) and butirosin \({ }^{43}\) led to the proposal that ribosylation proceeds from the primary metabolite 5-phospho-1-diphosphoribose (PRPP) via the action of a putative ribosyltransferase Neo17 (possibly assisted by a putative phosphomutase Neo19), followed by cleavage of the remaining 5-phosphate from the ribose subunit by a proposed phosphatase

Neo13 (Scheme 6, Table 3). \({ }^{48}\) However, the functions of these enzymes have not been experimentally demonstrated to date. It is not possible at this time to exclude an alternative biosynthetic pathway for neomycin/paromomycin in which ribose is first combined with neosamine to form the disaccharide consisting of rings III and IV, which is then ligated onto the neamine/paromamine pseudodisaccharide; however, given the level of sequence identity (42%) between the putative glycosyltransferases in the butirosin and neomycin gene clusters, one might expect that they would act upon very similar substrates, suggesting stepwise rather than simultaneous addition of the ribose and neosamine rings. The origin of the xylofuranose ring in xylostasin has not been established. It may derive from the PRPP epimer 5-phospho-1-diphosphoxylose (PXPP); alternatively, xylostasin may derive instead from ribostamycin by epimerisation of the hydroxyl at C-3". A homologue of the putative oxidoreductase BtrF from *B. circulans* might perform this proposed epimerisation.

**Scheme 6** Biosynthesis of ribostamycin and xylostasin.

The second neosamine subunit, which constitutes ring IV of neomycin and paromomycin, is most likely biosynthesised in the same manner as the neosamine C in neamine biosynthesis, but with an additional epimerisation step required to account for the presence of the epimeric neosamine B in neomycin B and paromomycin I (Scheme 7). Feeding studies with labelled D-glucose or labelled D-glucosamine showed that the ring IV neosamines derive from D-glucose via D-glucosamine with the same labelling pattern as the ring I neosamine C. \({ }^{26}\) The transfer of D-glucosamine to form ring IV was confirmed to precede transamination, as in ring I transfer, by the isolation of 6"-deamino-6"-hydroxyneomycin and 6"-deamino-6"-hydroxyparomomycin from cultures of

Scheme 7 Proposed biosynthesis of paromomycins and neomycins.

S. fradiae and S. rimosus, respectively.⁷⁸ It is possible that D-glucosamine is attached to 3-O of the ribose moiety by the same glycosyltransferase, Neo8, that attaches ring I to 2-DOS in neamine biosynthesis, as only one appropriate glycosyltransferase gene is found in the neomycin gene cluster; therefore, one would expect the glycosyl donor to again be GlcNAc, and that the BtrD homologue Neo16 again deacetylates the N-acetyl group following formation of the glycosyl linkage. However, a dual-function glycosyltransferase in neomycin biosynthesis that tolerates two very different glycosyl acceptor sites would be surprising given the high identity (90%) between RbmD, which transfers only a single UDP-GlcNAc in ribostamycin biosynthesis, and Neo8. Further, the isolation of a mutant of S. fradiae that produces ribostamycin instead of neomycin strongly suggests the existence of a second glycosyltransferase.⁷⁷

It is very likely that the same dehydrogenase and aminotransferase pair, Neo11 and Neo18, responsible for the introduction of the 6'-amine in ring I also perform the transamination at C-6" of ring IV, as there do not appear to be other dehydrogenase or aminotransferase genes in the neomycin gene cluster. Feeding studies with labelled [1-¹⁴C, 6-³H]-D-glucose showed that the overall stereochemistry of the transamination is the same as for the transamination of paromamine to neamine, consistent with a second action of Neo11 and Neo18.⁷⁹ Furthermore, Neo18 catalyses transamination at both C-6' of ring I in neamine and C-6" of ring IV in neomycin, suggesting that it is, as proposed, a dual-function aminotransferase.⁷³ However, this dual-function hypothesis again raises questions, this time regarding paromomycin biosynthesis. Given the very high sequence identity between both the dehydrogenases (71%) and the aminotransferases (69%) in the neomycin and paromomycin gene clusters, it is surprising that these two enzymes should act at two sites in neomycin biosynthesis but at only one in paromomycin biosynthesis. This suggests that a subtle control mechanism for substrate differentiation may distinguish the two biosynthetic systems.

The existence of neomycin and paromomycin as pairs of epimers differing in their stereochemistry at C-5 of the ring IV neosamine is rationalised by the existence of an epimerase enzyme. It was shown that the epimerisation leading to neosamine B in neomycin B proceeds with loss of the C-5 tritium from [U-¹⁴C, 5-³H]-D-glucose, likely by formation of an enolate with a neighbouring carbonyl at C-4 or C-6; formation of the C-4 ketone is unlikely based on the observation that the C-4 tritium from [U-¹⁴C, 3,4-³H₂]-D-glucose is undisturbed in the product.⁷⁹ Therefore, it appears that the epimerase acts after oxidation at C-6 by Neo11 but before transamination by Neo18. This hypothesis requires that Neo18 recognise both configurations of ring IV as viable substrates to afford the observed pair of epimeric products. At this time, the enzyme responsible for the epimerisation step has not been identified. It is also possible that the aminotransferase enzyme itself catalyses the epimerisation step whilst passing through the substrate–PLP imine intermediate, but if it is the same aminotransferase as in neamine biosynthesis, then the absence of the epimer of neamine would require a specific mechanism for modulating the epimerase activity. The positive identification and characterisation of the enzymes responsible for the final steps of neomycin and paromomycin biosynthesis will aid the resolution of several intriguing questions regarding these two very similar biosynthetic pathways.

### 3.2 Butirosin

Butirosin, produced by *B. circulans*, was the first aminoglycoside found to be produced by a non-actinomycete bacterium.⁸⁰ Butirosin is a complex of two epimers, butirosin A and butirosin B, which are structurally identical to xylostasin and ribostamycin, respectively, except for the addition of an (S)-4-amino-2-hydroxybutyryl side chain (AHBA) at 1-N of the 2-DOS ring. This aminoacyl chain is unique among the naturally-occurring aminoglycosides, and is known to improve the activity

of the antibiotic towards a number of aminoglycoside-resistant pathogens. 81 The AHBA side chain not only directly protects the 1-N position from deactivating acetylation, but also diminishes the effect of several other resistance enzymes toward the antibiotic. Synthetic addition of AHBA to kanamycin A and dibekacin (4′-deoxytobramycin) gives the clinically valuable compounds amikacin 82 and arbekacin, 83 respectively.

The biosynthesis of butirosin is assumed to be largely identical to that of its parent molecules, ribostamycin and xylostasin. Of greater interest is the biosynthetic origin of the AHBA side chain. Initially, it was proposed that the free acid AHBA is incorporated directly onto the aminoglycoside based on the observation of AHBA-dependent ATP–PPi exchange in extracts of *B. circulans*. 84 However, the enzyme responsible for the observed activity was never isolated. Furthermore, feeding studies found that labelled L-glutamate and γ-aminobutyrate (GABA) are incorporated into butirosin, but labelled AHBA is not, casting doubt on the direct addition of free AHBA to the aminoglycoside. 85

Following the identification of the butirosin biosynthetic gene cluster, the biosynthetic origin of AHBA has been recently revisited. 43,86 Comparison to the neomycin biosynthetic cluster from *S. fradiae* revealed a suite of seven *B. circulans* genes lacking homologues in the neomycin cluster that were proposed to participate in the biosynthesis and incorporation of the AHBA side chain, and functional characterisation of these enzymes has elucidated the biosynthetic pathway (Scheme 8). 86 L-Glutamate is loaded onto a discrete acyl carrier protein (ACP) BtrI via the γ-carboxylate by the ATP-dependent acyl phosphate synthase/ligase BtrJ. The γ-glutamyl-ACP is then decarboxylated by the PLP-dependent decarboxylase BtrK. Interestingly, the product of decarboxylation, GABA-BtrI, is not observed as a discrete intermediate; rather, it appears to be immediately γ-glutamylated at the terminal amine by a second action of BtrJ. This rapid synthesis of γ-glutamyl-GABA-BtrI is proposed to be a rare example of protective chemistry in biosynthesis based

on the observation that the GABA-CoA thioester is unstable, presumably due to facile cyclisation to the γ-lactam. Precedent for the γ-glutamyl protection of nucleophilic amines is found in the putrescine utilisation pathway of *Escherichia coli* K-12, in which putrescine is γ-glutamylated prior to oxidation to γ-aminobutyraldehyde; 87 in the absence of the γ-glutamyl protective group, this species would likely undergo spontaneous cyclization to Δ1-pyrroline. 88

The protected γ-glutamyl-GABA-BtrI intermediate is stereospecifically α-hydroxylated by a two-component monooxygenase system consisting of the FMN-dependent monooxygenase BtrO and its companion NADH : FMN oxidoreductase BtrV. From this point, it is believed that the protected acyl chain is transferred onto the aminoglycoside scaffold and finally deprotected as the last steps of butirosin biosynthesis. It is proposed that BtrH is the necessary acyltransferase, whilst BtrG is the amide hydrolase that removes the protective group (unpublished results). Neither of these enzymes bears significant homology to known protein functional families, and their analysis and characterisation promises to reveal interesting new catalytic mechanisms.

Whilst xylostasin and ribostamycin are distinct products produced by very different organisms (*B. circulans* and *S. ribosidificus*, respectively), butirosin exists as a mixture with both stereochemistries of ring III. The origin of the furanose is likely to be the same as for xylostasin, given that both butirosin and xylostasin are products of *B. circulans*; however, the mixture of stereochemistries in butirosin contrasts with the uniformity of xylostasin, suggesting a significant difference between the two biosyntheses. The mixture of stereochemistry might be explained by a less selective glycosyltransferase capable of using both xylose and ribose; alternatively, the mixture may result from incomplete enzymatic epimerisation. The observation that butirosin B is readily converted to butirosin A by two neamine-negative mutants of *B. circulans* hints that an epimerase enzyme exists (possibly Btrf). 69 However, these mutants do not convert butirosin A to butirosin B as might be expected for an equilibrium-seeking epimerase. Further investigation is required to fully understand the final steps of butirosin biosynthetic pathway.

### 4 4,6-Disubstituted aminoglycosides

#### 4.1 Kanamycins and tobramycin

The kanamycins, produced by *S. kanamyceticus*, 4 and tobramycin, produced by *Streptomyces tenebrarius*, 89 are pseudotrisaccharide aminoglycosides composed of a neamine-like moiety (kanamycin A: 2′-deamino-2′-hydroxyneamine; kanamycin B: neamine; kanamycin C: paromamine; tobramycin: 3′-deoxyneamine) modified at C-6 with a kanosamine ring (D-3-glucosamine). Feeding studies with radiolabelled precursors showed that 14C-labelled D-glucose is incorporated into all subunits of kanamycin A, consistent with observations from other aminoglycoside biosyntheses. Interestingly, [1-14C]-D-2-glucosamine was also found to be a precursor for kanamycin A biosynthesis, but the radiolabel was incorporated only into ring I, which appears more likely to derive directly from D-glucose rather than D-glucosamine. The fact that rings II and III do not incorporate the label, however, strongly suggests that the labelled D-glucosamine is not incorporated via initial conversion to D-glucose, but is in fact incorporated directly

into the product. The biosynthesis of kanamycin A appears, therefore, to include deamination of the 2'-position at some stage, possibly via a transamination-reduction sequence. Feeding studies on kanamycins B and C and on tobramycin have not been reported, but their structural similarity to kanamycin A likely reflects equally similar biosynthetic pathways. It is possible that kanamycins B and C are precursors to kanamycin A, and further study is required to determine the correct biosynthetic pathway for these antibiotics (Scheme 9).

**Scheme 9** Possible biosynthesis of the kanamycins.

The addition and elaboration of the kanosamine ring at C-6 is believed to proceed from D-glucose via UDP-D-glucose<sup>90</sup> with the aid of a glycosyltransferase, likely KanE (Table 4).<sup>51</sup> The 2-DOS-attached D-glucose is believed, as in the elaboration of other aminoglycoside sugars, to be converted to kanosamine by a dehydrogenation-transamination sequence at C-3. The enzyme KanI<sup>51</sup> was originally assigned as a D-glucose 3-dehydrogenase and is homologous to TacB;<sup>45</sup> therefore, KanI and TacB were proposed to be the dehydrogenases responsible for the elaboration of kanosamine. However, both these enzymes are homologous to BtrQ and other paromamine 6'-dehydrogenases, and are more likely involved in that step. KanC, however, is homologous only to TbmC and GntC among aminoglycoside biosynthetic enzymes. As these three gene clusters all require D-glucose 3-dehydrogenase, these enzymes are more likely to provide this activity. KanD is the

probable aminotransferase for the final conversion to kanosamine. Alternatively, the oxidation and transamination might occur on the UDP-D-glucose prior to glycosyltransfer, as in the biosynthesis of free kanosamine in *Bacillus amyloliquefaciens*.<sup>91</sup>

### 4.2 Gentamicin and sagamicin

Gentamicin,<sup>92</sup> a product of various species of *Micromonospora*, exists as a complex of closely-related aminoglycoside structures. Most clinically significant is the gentamicin C complex consisting of gentamicins C<sub>1</sub>, C<sub>1a</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>, and C<sub>2b</sub> (sagamicin<sup>93</sup>). The gentamicins are composed of 2-DOS substituted at C-4 with a purpuromicin sugar and at C-6 with a garosamine sugar. Feeding studies indicated the incorporation of [U-<sup>14</sup>C]-D-glucose and [1-<sup>14</sup>C]-D-glucosamine into gentamicin, although the location of the labels was not determined.<sup>94</sup> The several methyl groups in the gentamicins were shown to derive from SAM by feeding with [methyl-<sup>14</sup>C]-L-methionine.<sup>94</sup> The time-dependence of labelling by L-methionine grants useful insight into the order of transformations in the biosynthetic pathway: gentamicin A, gentamicin X<sub>2</sub>, and antibiotic G418 are rapidly labelled by [methyl-<sup>14</sup>C]-L-methionine within 15 minutes of supplementation, indicating that these intermediates biosynthetically precede gentamicins C<sub>1</sub>, C<sub>1a</sub>, and C<sub>2</sub>, which only acquire the label after 24 hours incubation.<sup>95</sup> A proposed biosynthetic pathway for the gentamicin C complex diverging from the common intermediate gentamicin X<sub>2</sub> was developed based on the successful conversion of putative pathway intermediates to gentamicin C by a 2-DOS idiophth of *M. purpurea* (Scheme 10).<sup>96</sup>

The general gentamicin C pseudotrisaccharide scaffold is thought to derive from the addition of D-xylohexose to paromamine by a glycosyltransferase, likely GntD. The garosamine moiety is probably elaborated by sequential dehydrogenation (by GntC) and transamination (by GntF) at C-3 of the xylose ring, followed by SAM-dependent methylation of the amine, giving the intermediate gentamicin A. The garosamine ring is completed by methylation at C-4, probably via a radical mechanism involving GntK, a fortimicin KL1 methyltransferase homolog and member of the Radical SAM superfamily, or GntE, a putative Fe-S oxidoreductase/methyltransferase.

From this common intermediate, gentamicin X<sub>2</sub>, the three major components of the gentamicin C complex appear to be divergently biosynthesised. For gentamicin C<sub>1a</sub>, the D-glucosamine ring is likely transformed to neosamine by sequential dehydrogenation and transamination by GntX and GntW, respectively. The neosamine ring would then be dideoxygenated at C-3 and C-4 to purpuromicin and the product gentamicin C<sub>1a</sub>. Methylation of the C-6 amine in this ring gives sagamicin. For gentamicins C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub>, methylation at C-6 of the D-glucosamine ring (again, likely via a radical mechanism) likely precedes dehydrogenation and transamination to 6-methylneosamine. Dideoxygenation at C-3 and C-4 gives gentamicin C<sub>2</sub>, and further methylation of the amine at C-6 of the purpuromicin ring gives gentamicin C<sub>1</sub>.<sup>97</sup>

## 5 Conclusions

As evidenced by the work reviewed here, the seemingly straightforward and methodological biosynthetic pathways of the aminoglycoside antibiotics belie a number of surprising and puzzling com-

plexities, from unexpected multi-functional enzymes to unusual protective group chemistry. As new biosynthetic gene clusters are sequenced and enzyme functions are demonstrated, one may expect that the resolution of these pathways and mechanisms will not only clarify the biosynthesis of these important natural products, but also increase the understanding of the regulation of enzymatic catalysis and the evolution of biosynthetic pathways in general.
