This study was conducted to investigate the possible involvement of protein kinase C (PKC) and serine/threonine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor in insulin resistance and/or obesity. Insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activity was depressed in muscle from obese insulin-resistant patients compared with lean insulin-responsive control subjects. Alkaline phosphatase treatment resulted in a significant 48% increase in in vitro insulin-stimulated receptor tyrosine kinase activity in obese but not lean muscle. To investigate the involvement of PKC in skeletal muscle insulin resistance and/or obesity, membrane-associated PKC activity and the protein content of various PKC isoforms were measured in human skeletal muscle from lean, insulin-responsive, and obese insulin-resistant patients. Membrane-associated PKC activity was not changed; however, PKC-β protein content, assayed by Western blot analysis, was significantly higher, whereas PKC-θ, -η, and -μ were significantly lower in muscle from obese patients compared with muscle from lean control subjects. Incubation of muscle strips with insulin significantly increased membrane-associated PKC activity in muscle from obese but not lean subjects. PKC-δ, -β, and -θ were translocated from the cytosol to the membrane fraction in response to insulin treatment. These results suggest that in skeletal muscle from insulin-resistant obese patients, insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activity was reduced because of hyperphosphorylation on serine/threonine residues. Membrane-associated PKC-β protein was elevated under basal conditions, and membrane-associated total PKC activity was increased under insulin-stimulated conditions in muscle from obese insulin-resistant patients. Thus, we postulate that the decreased tyrosine kinase activity of the insulin receptor may be caused by serine/threonine phosphorylation by PKC. *Diabetes* 49:1353–1358, 2000

W hereas insulin binding induces autophosphorylation of the insulin receptor on specific tyrosine residues, phosphorylation of the insulin receptor on serine/threonine residues reduces tyrosine kinase activity (1,2). In vitro purified protein kinase C (PKC) directly phosphorylated purified insulin receptors and decreased their tyrosine kinase activity (3). Furthermore, in tissue cultured cells overexpressing the insulin receptor, an increase in PKC activity was correlated to an increase in serine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor (4). Evidence that increased activity of PKC may be associated with insulin resistance comes from many cell culture experiments (4–8). In addition, it was observed that membrane-bound PKC activity was increased in insulin-resistant rat fat cells, and insulin resistance was reversed with the addition of specific PKC inhibitors (9). Evidence from our laboratory (10) also suggests the involvement of PKC in insulin resistance. When insulin-resistant muscle was incubated with a PKC inhibitor, insulin action was restored. Incubation of insulin-sensitive muscle with a PKC activator reduced insulin action. This result is strong evidence to support the involvement of PKC in insulin resistance. A recent study demonstrated that an increase in free fatty acids (FFAs) may activate PKC-θ and induce skeletal muscle insulin resistance in rats (11). Because it was demonstrated that insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activity is impaired in skeletal muscle from insulin-resistant patients (12,13), PKC may phosphorylate the insulin receptor on serine residues and decrease the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activity. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the involvement of PKC and excessive serine/threonine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor in insulin resistance in human rectus abdominus skeletal muscle.

aprotinin, and 1% Triton X-100). There was 500 μg of protein extract added to each well of the microplate. Wells were incubated either with 100 μl of 0.1 mol/l Tris (pH 8.5) or alkaline phosphatase (30 U/well) (type VII N from bovine intestinal mucosa) in 0.1 mol/l Tris (pH 8.5). To measure the tyrosine kinase activity of the bound insulin receptors, 80 μl assay buffer (50 mmol/l HEPES, 0.05% bovine serum albumin, 150 mmol/l NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 20 mmol/l MgCl₂, and 2 mmol/l MnCl₂) and 20 μl reaction mixture (30 nmol/l ATP, 4 μCi [γ-³²P] ATP, and 3 mg/ml PolyGlu:Tyr) were added. A Beckman LS 6500 Multi-purpose Scintillation Counter (Beckman Instruments, Fullerton, CA) was used to determine incorporation of [γ-³²P] ATP.

In vitro human skeletal muscle incubations. Lean insulin-responsive patients and obese insulin-resistant patients undergoing elective surgeries (primarily hysterectomies for lean patients and gastric bypass for obese patients) served as subjects. The experimental protocol for obtaining muscle biopsies was explained to all patients, and informed consent was obtained from each subject. This procedure was approved by the East Carolina University Policy and Review Committee on Human Research. Of the patients in each group, 9 out of 12 were taking medication at the time of surgery. Medications that were taken by 3–5 patients included the following: droperidol, ondansetron HCl, cefazolin sodium, midazolam HCl, metoclopramide HCl, promethazine HCl, meperidine HCl, furosemide, heparin sodium, and morphine sulfate. There was no discernible difference in medication use among groups, and medication did not appear to alter results within a group. When surgery was performed on these patients, a muscle biopsy held by a clamp was obtained from the rectus abdominus muscle and placed in a container with oxygenated Krebs-Henseleit buffer for transport to the laboratory. Muscle fiber strips were “teased” from the muscle sample, clamped in Lucite clips, and placed into separate wells containing Krebs-Henseleit buffer (plus 1% bovine serum albumin and 1.0 mmol/l pyruvate) at 29°C under normoxic conditions (95% O₂, 5% CO₂).

Measurement of glucose transport into human muscle in our laboratory has been described elsewhere (15). In this study, preincubation experiments (lasting 60 min) for PKC activity and Western blot analysis were conducted under the following conditions: basal (no insulin added) and porcine insulin added (10⁻⁷ mol/l; last 10 min). Muscle fiber strips were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80°C until further use.

Western blot analysis. Western blot analysis was performed as described elsewhere (16). Frozen rectus abdominus skeletal muscle was homogenized. The protein content was determined using Bio-Rad protein assay (catalog #500-0002, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Samples were separated using 8% SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and electrotransferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride microporous membrane. Isoform-specific PKC antibodies at a dilution factor of 1:1,000 (unless otherwise stated) in 5% nonfat milk were added to the membranes. Secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase was added at a dilution of 1:5,000, and membranes were subjected to enhanced chemiluminescence (Western blot chemiluminescence reagent; Dupont). Autoradiographs were quantitated on a Hewlett Packard ScanJet IIcx/T using Imagequant software (Molecular Dynamics). Because our immunoblots showed a wide range of signal intensities, we produced multiple exposures and attempted to optimize linearity of the signal.

PKC enzyme assay. PKC activity was determined using the PKC enzyme assay system (Amersham). Rectus abdominus skeletal muscle was homogenized and assayed as described in the Amersham protocol kit. The protein content was determined using a Bio-Rad protein assay. The phosphorylated peptides were separated using binding paper discs and counted in 5 ml scintillant using a Beckman LS 6500 Multi-purpose Scintillation Counter.

Statistical analysis. The insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activity data were analyzed using 2-way analysis of variance with repeated measures (alkaline phosphatase and insulin treatments as repeated measures). Western blot analysis data of various PKC isoforms’ protein content, insulin-stimulated glucose transport, and PKC activity data were analyzed with an unpaired t test.

RESULTS

Although muscle from an obese group of individuals is more insulin resistant than that from a lean group (15), we occasionally study lean patients that do not demonstrate insulin stimulation of muscle glucose transport and obese patients that demonstrate insulin stimulation. This heterogeneity has also been observed in adipocytes from obese patients (17, 18). Therefore, to study the mechanisms of insulin resistance in human rectus abdominus skeletal muscle, we chose to study only muscle samples from lean insulin-responsive patients (insulin stimulation of glucose transport > 1.5-fold) and obese

insulin-resistant patients (insulin stimulation of glucose transport < 1.5-fold). Patient characteristics are summarized in Table 1, and the glucose transport data are shown in Fig. 1.

Using an insulin receptor capture assay, we found that the in vitro insulin-stimulated insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activity was significantly decreased in skeletal muscle from obese insulin-resistant patients (Table 2). To investigate whether the decreased tyrosine kinase activity was due to increased serine/threonine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor, insulin receptors from lean insulin-responsive and obese insulin-resistant skeletal muscle were isolated and treated with alkaline phosphatase to dephosphorylate the insulin receptor before insulin treatment. In vitro insulin-stimulated receptor tyrosine kinase activity was increased by 48% in obese insulin-resistant human skeletal muscle but was not significantly changed in muscle from lean insulin-responsive patients after alkaline phosphatase treatment (Table 2). This result suggests that the increased serine/threonine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor may in part be associated with reduced insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activity in obese insulin-resistant skeletal muscle.

Although the kinase responsible for the excessive serine/threonine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor is not yet known, data from the literature support the involvement

of PKC. To investigate the possible involvement of PKC in skeletal muscle insulin resistance, Western blot analysis was used as a technique to measure the protein content of different PKC isoforms in muscle from lean insulin-responsive and obese insulin-resistant patients. Western blots of membrane fractions were probed with PKC antibodies for the different PKC isoforms. The membrane fraction contained sarcolemma, t-tubules, sarcoplasmic reticulum, nuclei, and mitochondria (19). The protein content of the conventional PKC isoform $\beta$ was significantly higher ($P < 0.05$) in the membrane fraction of skeletal muscle from obese patients compared with the lean control subjects. In contrast, the protein content of the novel PKC isoforms ($\eta$, $\theta$, and $\mu$) were significantly lower ($P < 0.05$) in the membrane fraction of skeletal muscle from obese patients compared with the lean control subjects (Table 3, Fig. 2). No significant difference in the protein content of various PKC isoforms was observed in the cytosolic fraction in muscle from obese patients compared with the control subjects (Table 4, Fig. 3).

Membrane-associated PKC activity was measured in human rectus abdominus muscle from lean insulin-responsive and obese insulin-resistant patients. There was no significant change in membrane-associated PKC activity in muscle from obese patients (lean $292 \pm 42 \text{pmol} \cdot \text{min}^{-1} \cdot \text{mg}^{-1}$ protein; obese $255 \pm 30 \text{pmol} \cdot \text{min}^{-1} \cdot \text{mg}^{-1}$ protein).

To investigate whether insulin treatment in vitro is associated with increased PKC activity in muscle, muscle fiber strips from lean insulin-responsive and obese insulin-resistant subjects were incubated with and without insulin, and membrane-associated PKC activity was measured. Insulin stimulation of PKC activity in the membrane fraction was significantly greater ($P < 0.05$) in muscle from obese insulin-resistant patients than lean insulin-responsive control subjects (Fig. 4). Which PKC isoform(s) translocates to the membrane fraction in response to insulin was investigated in rectus abdominus muscle fiber strips from obese patients incubated with and without insulin. Western blot analysis using antibodies for different PKC isoforms was used to determine the protein content of various PKC isoforms in the membrane fraction. PKC-$\beta$, -$\delta$, and -$\theta$ showed a significant increase in membrane-associated protein in response to insulin treatment.

DISCUSSION  
In skeletal muscle from women with polycystic ovary syndrome, excessive serine/threonine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor has been suggested as a potential mechanism for insulin resistance (20). In skeletal muscle from obese Zucker rats, insulin-stimulated tyrosine kinase activity in obese rats was reduced by 39%. Alkaline phosphatase treatment of receptors from obese muscle increased insulin-stimulated receptor tyrosine kinase activity 3 times more than that of lean control muscle (14). This result suggests that excessive serine/threonine phosphorylation may play a role in the decreased insulin-stimulated receptor tyrosine kinase activity seen in muscle from obese insulin-resistant patients. As mentioned above, the insulin-stimulated tyrosine kinase activity of insulin receptors from obese muscle was partially (not completely) restored compared with the lean control subjects. One explanation is that our treatment of the insulin receptors with alkaline phosphatase resulted in the removal of some but not all of the phosphates. Complete dephosphorylation of the insulin receptors may require prolonged treatment with alkaline phosphatase, which leads to loss of tyrosine kinase activity (data not shown).

A recent study from our laboratory (10) demonstrated that the PKC inhibitor GF 109203X restores insulin stimulation of glucose transport in insulin-resistant muscles. In addition, incubation of insulin-responsive muscles with 12-deoxyphorbol

measuring the membrane-associated PKC activity, we found no significant difference in muscle from obese and lean control subjects. This finding could be because PKC-β protein content was significantly higher in muscle from obese patients, whereas PKC-η, -θ, and -μ protein contents were lower.

Studies have shown that insulin treatment causes activation and translocation of PKC-α, -β, and -ζ in 3T3/L1 cells (24) and PKC-α, -β, -θ, and -ε in rat skeletal muscle (25). We wondered if insulin might be increasing PKC activity to cause insulin resistance in obese subjects. Muscle fiber strips from lean insulin-responsive and obese insulin-resistant patients were incubated with and without insulin, and membrane-associated PKC activity was measured. Insulin-stimulated PKC activity in the membrane fraction was significantly increased in muscle from obese insulin-resistant patients compared with the lean insulin-responsive control subjects. In addition, the membrane-to-cytosol ratio further points toward translocation of PKC to the membrane and its activation in muscle from obese patients (data not shown). This result suggests that PKC in muscle from obese patients is more sensitive to translocation and activation upon insulin treatment. To determine which PKC isoforms in muscle from obese patients translocate to the membrane fraction in response to insulin, we incubated muscle fiber strips with insulin and measured the protein content of various PKC isoforms. PKC-β, -δ, and -θ translocated to the membrane fraction in response to insulin, which may explain the increased insulin-stimulated PKC activity seen in the membrane fraction of muscle from obese subjects.

In summary, these results suggest that in skeletal muscle from insulin-resistant obese patients, insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activity was reduced because of hyperphosphorylation on serine/threonine residues. Membrane-associated PKC-β protein was elevated under basal conditions, and membrane-associated total PKC activity was increased under insulin-stimulated conditions in muscle from obese insulin-resistant patients. Thus, we postulate that the decreased tyrosine kinase activity of the insulin receptor may be caused by serine/threonine phosphorylation by PKC.
