## Abstract  

The Hedgehog signalling pathway is important in embryological development and is highly conserved through evolution. Recently Patched, a member of the pathway, was found to be important in Gorlin's syndrome. Inherited Patched gene mutations underlie the syndrome, in which a key feature is multiple basal cell carcinomas (BCCs). The gene is also mutated in sporadic BCCs as well as in sporadic occurrences of other tumours seen in Gorlin's syndrome. The precise mechanism whereby Patched gene mutation leads to tumour development is not known, but BCC is characterized by relentless local invasion and only rarely metastasizes. This suggests that abnormalities of the Hedgehog pathway account for these features. This proposal is discussed in the context of what is already known about the normal function of the Hedgehog pathway and its deregulation in cancer. Copyright © 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

## Introduction  

Many of the genes that are important in cancer are also important in embryological development [1]. This is not too surprising since the types of processes disrupted in cancer, such as cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, motility, and senescence, are crucial in embryological development. One such gene, Patched (Ptc), is involved in developmental patterning and is now known to be a tumour suppressor gene [2,3]. This gene was first discovered in the fruit fly *Drosophila* [4] and, as a testimony to its importance, is highly conserved through evolution [5,6]. The gene encodes a protein which is a crucial part of the hedgehog (Hh) signalling pathway. There has been much work performed on the role of this signalling pathway in development, but the role that it plays in cancer is only just beginning to be understood. There is strong evidence that deregulation of the pathway is important in several cancers, but precisely how this results in tumour development remains to be established.  

## The Hh signalling pathway  

Our understanding of the Hh signalling pathway comes mainly from the study of *Drosophila*, where a number of proteins are recognized to be important for pathway function. Ptc is a transmembrane protein with 12 membrane-spanning domains and two extracellular loops [5,7–9] and serves as a receptor for the secreted protein Hh [10,11]. Ptc inhibits the Hh pathway by repressing the activity of smoothened (Smo) [12–14], another transmembrane membrane protein (Figure 1a). The Ptc-mediated inhibition is removed when Hh binds to Smo (Figure 1b). Cubitus interruptus (Ci) is a transcription factor [15] which is thought to form a cytoplasmic complex with the proteins fused and costal 2 [16,17]. Fused is a serine-threonine kinase [18] and costal 2 is a kinesin-related protein that binds the Ci-containing complex to microtubules [16]. Current evidence suggests that Smo activity favours translocation of an active form of Ci from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, where it promotes transcription of downstream target genes [19]. These genes include Ptc [20], decapentaplegic (Dpp) [17], and wingless (Wg) [21,22]. In essence, the transcription of downstream target genes is switched on when Hh is bound to Ptc and off when it is not. Since Ptc is a conserved downstream target gene of the signalling pathway [23], its expression can be used as a marker of Hh pathway activity. This proposal is supported by the finding of Ptc gene expression in cells adjacent to those expressing Hh [5,7,24].  

Vertebrate homologues of *Drosophila* Hh and Ptc exist [2,3,25] and these too are expressed in adjacent cells. The vertebrate homologues of Hh include Sonic, Indian, and Desert [25,26]. Vertebrate Ptc homologues are Ptcl and Ptc2 [27]. Smo and Ci also have homologues in vertebrates [28,29]. The latter is related to vertebrate Gli transcription factors, which are overexpressed in human gliomas [30,31]. This suggests that the entire pathway is conserved through evolution. However, in contrast to *Drosophila*, the Hh pathway has not yet been studied in detail in vertebrates. The downstream target genes identified in *Drosophila* also have vertebrate homologues. Dpp shows homology with the bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs) and is a member of the TGFβ superfamily [26,32]. Wg shows homology with wnt-1 [33], a signalling protein.

again, from lower animals such as *Drosophila*, where it is important in segmentation and imaginal disc formation [23]. In vertebrates, it is important in development of the pharyngeal arches, limb buds, neural tube, and somites [7], and at many sites of epithelial-mesenchymal interaction such as hair, whisker, and tooth formation [26]. These functions are mediated through the tight control of the Hh pathway and its target genes.

### Ptc gene mutations and cancer

In July 1996, the Ptc gene was linked to the basal cell naevus or Gorlin’s syndrome [2,3]. This interesting syndrome shows autosomal dominant inheritance and is characterized by a number of abnormalities including palmar and plantar pits, cleft lip and palate, hypertelorism, bifid ribs, calcification of the falx cerebri, and macrocephaly [34,35]. Several tumours feature in the syndrome, including medulloblastoma, ovarian fibroma, jaw cysts, and meningioma, but the most frequent tumour is BCC, occurring in 80–90% of cases [34]. The development of tumours in the syndrome is in keeping with Knudson’s ‘two-hit hypothesis’ as typified by familial retinoblastoma [36]. According to this hypothesis, the first ‘hit’ in familial cancer syndromes is a germline mutation in a tumour suppressor gene. This is followed by the second ‘hit’, which is a somatic mutation or deletion through recombination of the remaining allele. Sporadic tumours require two somatic hits. Germline mutations in Ptc have been found in families with Gorlin’s syndrome [3,37–40]. Germline Ptc mutations in *de novo* cases of Gorlin’s syndrome, but not their relatives, have also been found and are especially indicative of a causal link between the Ptc gene and the syndrome [3]. However, Gorlin’s syndrome accounts for only a small proportion of BCCs, with the vast majority being sporadic. Sporadic BCCs show evidence for two somatic hits affecting the Ptc gene [41], one of which is manifest as loss of heterozygosity (LOH) on chromosome 9q, the Ptc locus, in 68% of cases [42].

LOH at the Ptc locus has been detected in organoid naevi [43], which predispose to BCC, and in 41% of sporadic trichoepitheliomas [44]. Ptc mutations have also been found in other Gorlin’s syndrome-related tumours such as meningioma [45] and medulloblastoma [46–48]. Jaw cysts arising in Gorlin’s syndrome have germline Ptc mutation and LOH at the Ptc locus [49] and Ptc mutations have been identified in sporadic cases [50]. Interestingly, Ptc mutations have been detected in breast cancer (2 out of 7 cases analysed) [45] and transitional cell carcinoma (2 out of 54 cases analysed) [51], neither of which is associated with Gorlin’s syndrome, suggesting a wider role for Ptc mutation in cancer biology. However, subsequent studies have failed to find Ptc or other Hh pathway gene mutations in breast cancer [52,53].

### Other Hh pathway genes are also mutated in cancer

The evidence from Gorlin’s syndrome and sporadic BCCs shows that Ptc is a tumour suppressor gene and this is supported by finding frequent LOH in tumours [42], and a preponderance of mutations causing protein truncation [40]. Thus, the crucial abnormality is inactivation of Ptc protein. In functional terms, this causes Hh pathway overactivity due to unrestrained Smo activity and overexpression of Hh pathway target genes. If this is the critical process for Ptc mutations to cause tumour development, then mutations in other Hh pathway genes could have similar consequences. Smo mutations have been identified in BCCs [13,54,55] and primitive neuroectodermal tumours [54,55]. Smo mutations in BCC demonstrate *in vitro* and *in vivo* oncogenic activity [13]. Hh mutations have been demonstrated in 1 of 43 BCCs, 1 of 14 medulloblastomas, and 1 of 6 breast carcinomas, all three being identical H133Y mutations [45], but more recent studies have failed to confirm such mutations [52,56]. Additionally, overexpression of the Hh gene in transgenic human and mouse skin leads to tumours that are morphologically indistinguishable from BCCs

[57, 58]. The evidence suggests that the common effect of these mutations is overactivity of the Hh signalling pathway, leading to overexpression of downstream target genes. Elucidation of these downstream target genes in human tumours would therefore be of great interest. Genes that have been found to be over-expressed in BCC include Ptcl and 2; Gli1; BMP2 and 4; Wnt1, 5a, 7b, and 13 [59]; the EPH tyrosine receptor kinase; and MMP1 [60]. In contrast, other genes are repressed in BCC, such as bullous pemphigoid antigen 1, β4 integrin [59], chitinase, and c-fos [60].

### Hh pathway overactivity may be important in cancer invasion

In vivo models of Hh pathway deregulation have been used to assess the functional consequences of Hh pathway deregulation in skin. In these studies, the Hh gene was overexpressed in epidermal cells of transgenic mice [58] and in transgenic reconstituted human skin [57]. In the latter case, the skin was grafted onto the back of immune-deficient mice. The transgenic models resulted in activation of the Hh signalling pathway as shown by increased expression of downstream target genes. Both of these studies describe the formation of BCC-like tumours showing morphological and gene expression profiles mirroring that of human BCC. The tumours in transgenic mice occurred within the first few days of skin development but the mice died perinatally. In transgenic human skin, which was examined at 4, 6, and 8 weeks, the tumours arose within 4 weeks, occurring throughout the epidermis. The tumours ranged from small buds to more deeply penetrating epithelial islands. The rapid induction of BCC coupled with the absence of deliberate mutagenesis in these model systems strongly suggests that activation of the Hh signalling pathway alone initiates BCC formation. The crucial role of the pathway in the initiation of BCC is supported by the finding of LOH at chromosome 9q in both small and large tumours [42] and by the presence of Hh target gene over-expression in all subtypes of BCC [42, 61]. These data clearly link the Hh signalling pathway to the genesis of BCC and hence to its associated phenotype, which is characterized by relentless local invasion but extremely rare metastasis [62]. Therefore Hh pathway over-activity promotes a form of invasion but does not potentiate metastasis. Studies exploring this idea are limited, and further work is required to substantiate it.

#### How might Hh pathway target genes promote invasion?

The nature of the Hh pathway target genes makes the hypothesis of a role in cancer invasion very attractive. The exact nature of the overexpressed Hh pathway target genes in human BCCs is not known, but as the Hh pathway is highly conserved they are likely to include TGFβ and wnt family members. These secreted proteins are known to have a wide range of functions [63–65].

An expected consequence of wnt overexpression in BCC is increased levels of intracellular β-catenin [66, 67]. This interacts with E-cadherin, which is of great importance in cell-to-cell adhesion and hence invasion, and also can associate with transcription factors in the nucleus, leading to increased expression of c-myc [68], cyclin D1 [69, 70] and MMP7 [71]. Nuclear β-catenin has been demonstrated in colorectal [67], thyroid [72], ovarian [73, 74], endometrial [75], and oesophageal carcinomas [76, 77], along with melanoma [78, 79]. In BCC, strong nuclear β-catenin is seen in a very small proportion of cases (2 out of 54) (personal observation), although others have failed to see this [80]. Increased intracytoplasmic β-catenin in BCC might, on the one hand, be able to associate with E-cadherin, and, on the other, cause increased cell proliferation via up-regulation of genes such as c-myc. Indeed, evidence for Sonic Hh (Shh)-induced proliferation exists [81]. Such changes might produce a pushing, expansile mass of cohesive cells, perhaps just the type of invasion that would not enhance metastasis.

Is there evidence to support this hypothesis? No studies have looked at this directly but some support can be gleaned from the literature. BCC can be broadly classified into three subtypes, superficial, nodular, and infiltrative [82]. These are illustrated schematically in Figure 2. Deregulation of the Hh pathway apparently initiates BCC and is seen in all of its subtypes [61], so other factors must underlie the differences between subtypes. These subtypes are generally regarded as morphological variants, arising because of modifying

factors such as site of origin. An alternative, unexplored, interpretation of these data is that there is chronological tumour progression from superficial through to infiltrative BCC caused by accumulation of genetic alterations, perhaps in a step-wise fashion akin to that seen in colorectal cancer. The age distribution of the tumours lends some support to this idea, with superficial BCCs occurring on average at 56.8 years, nodular BCC at 63.9 years, and infiltrative BCC at 66.0 years [83]. In this scenario, Hh pathway deregulation represents the initiating step in BCC development and would be the dominant cellular abnormality in superficial and possibly nodular BCCs, which have pushing expansive groups of cells that retain E-cadherin [84,85], an appearance that conforms to the above hypothesis. By contrast, the infiltrative form has reduced E-cadherin [84,85] and occurs at an older age than the other types, suggesting, if step-wise tumour progression does occur, that additional genetic alterations have occurred and Hh deregulation is no longer the dominant cellular abnormality.

Discussion has so far concentrated on the possible role of the predicted increase in wnt signalling due to Hh pathway overactivity. However, TGFβ superfamily members are also predicted to be overexpressed in BCC. These have extremely diverse functions with effects on cell proliferation, expression of extracellular matrix proteins, morphogenic movements, apoptosis, and differentiation [64]. The exact effect depends on the cell type and differentiation status. In cancer, the evidence identifies resistance to TGFβ signalling as important in tumour development [86,87]. This is due to its role in cell-cycle inhibition in epithelial cells. However, increased TGFβ signalling is expected in BCC, so factors apart from cell-cycle control may be important in the progression of these tumours [87]. For instance, TGFβ1 has been shown to be important in promoting in vitro invasion in a model using melanoma cells [88]. Of the TGFβ superfamily members, BMP2 and 4 are the closest vertebrate homologues to Drosophila Dpp [32], with BMP2 and 4 having been shown to be up-regulated in BCC [59] and BMP2 in a transgenic model of BCC [57]. BMPs play an important role at sites of epithelial-mesenchymal interaction such as hair development, which is interesting in view of the specialized stroma associated with BCC and the frequent adnexal differentiation seen in these tumours [62]. Interactions between tumour and stroma are recognized to be important in tumour invasion [89] and BMPs may be important in mediating this complex process. The precise role that is played by overexpression of BMPs or other TGFβ homologues in BCC requires further study.

There is tentative experimental evidence that Hh pathway deregulation is important in invasion. Using an in vitro invasion assay, breast cancer cell lines with high Ptcl gene expression, a marker of Hh pathway activity, showed greater invasion than those with low expression [90], but further work is required to establish whether or not this is a causal relationship.


Conclusions

Hh signalling pathway deregulation represents a new and potentially important mechanism in tumour progression, being of established importance in BCC. These tumours have unusual behaviour, with the overwhelming majority of cases failing to metastasize and yet invading relentlessly. The tumour therefore represents a valuable resource for dissecting out genes that are important in invasion and not metastasis. The precise mechanism whereby Hh pathway deregulation enhances tumour formation remains to be established. However, the discovery that Hh pathway deregulation alone represents an initiating step in BCC points to a possible role in invasion. Further understanding of the biology of cancer invasion is highly desirable as a means of developing therapy. This is because most cancer deaths are attributable to invasion due to local tissue destruction and/or because it represents an early step in the generation of metastases. Study of BCC and the Hh signalling pathway may provide a novel opportunity to further our knowledge in this crucial area.
