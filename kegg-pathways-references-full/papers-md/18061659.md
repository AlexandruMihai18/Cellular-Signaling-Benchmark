### Abstract

Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is an increasing recognized condition that may progress to end-stage liver disease. There are consistent evidences that mitochondrial dysfunction plays a central role in NASH whatever its origin. Mitochondria are the key controller of fatty acids removal and this is part of an intensive gene program that modifies hepatocytes to counteract the excessive fat storage. Mitochondrial dysfunction participates at different levels in NASH pathogenesis since it impairs fatty liver homeostasis and induces overproduction of ROS that in turn trigger lipid peroxidation, cytokines release and cell death. In this review we briefly recall the role of mitochondria in fat metabolism and energy homeostasis and focus on the role of mitochondrial impairment and uncoupling proteins in the pathophysiology of NASH progression. We suggest that mitochondrial respiratory chain, UCP2 and redox balance cooperate in a common pathway that permits to set down the mitochondrial redox pressure, limits the risk of oxidative damage, and allows the maximal rate of fat removal. When the environmental conditions change and high energy supply occurs, hepatocytes are unable to replace their ATP store and steatosis progress to NASH and cirrhosis. The beneficial effects of some drugs on mitochondrial function are also discussed.

1. Introduction

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is an increasing recognized condition that may progress to end-stage liver disease. NAFLD refers to a wide range of liver damage, from simple steatosis to steatohepatitis. It is now considered a social problem in the Western countries, where it affects up to 20% of people in general population, and more than half of obese subjects (Angulo, 2002). Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a stage of the NAFLD. The term was coined by Ludwig in 1980 to describe a liver disease that histologically mimics alcoholic hepatitis but occurs in individuals who do not abuse alcohol. The prevalence of NASH is around 3% in general population and around 20% in obese people (Silverman et al., 1990; Wanless and Lentz, 1990). While steatosis is a benign condition in the majority of the population, the clinical importance of NASH is related to its capacity to evolve in liver cirrhosis and it is considered the main cause of cryptogenic cirrhosis (Caldwell and Crespo, 2004) and liver transplantation (Hui et al., 2003).

The pathogenesis of NASH is poorly understood and the mechanisms are still being worked out. Day and James proposed that the development of NASH involves two pathophysiologic hits (Day and James, 1998): the first one is the peripheral insulin resistance that increases lipolysis and free fatty acids transport to the liver, leading to steatosis; the “second hit” includes oxidative stress, decreased hepatic ATP production and induction of proinflammatory cytokines which lead to steatohepatitis.

Several recent studies have revised this model of pathogenesis assigning to mitochondrial oxidative stress and cytokines the central role and limiting steatosis to being epiphenomenon of the injurious mechanism (Correz-Pinto et al., 2006).

It has been reported that patients with NASH present ultrastructural mitochondrial alterations (Caldwell et al., 1999), impairment of hepatic ATP synthesis (Cortez-Pinto et al., 1999) and increased ROS production (Hensley et al., 2000; Perez-Carreras et al., 2003). Thus, mitochondrial dysfunction may be the key player from steatosis to steatohepatitis progression, since it impairs fatty liver homeostasis and induces overproduction of ROS that in turn trigger lipid peroxidation, cytokines release and cell death (Begriche et al., 2006).

The present review briefly recalls the role of mitochondria in fat metabolism and energy homeostasis and focuses on the role of mitochondrial impairment and uncoupling in the pathophysiology of NASH progress-

sion. A novel mechanism of interaction between mitochondrial redox modulation and respiratory chain function is also proposed.

2. Mitochondria in fatty acids metabolism

2.1. Physiological aspects of β-oxidation

Hepatic free fatty acids (FFAs) may have different sources:

- adipose tissue;
- chylomicrons hydrolysis;
- de novo synthesis.

If energy demand is low, hepatic FFAs are esterified as triglycerides and stored into the cytosol or secreted in the plasma as very low density lipoproteins. On the contrary, in conditions of energy deficiency, FFAs are utilized as follows:

- by mitochondria and peroxisomes through β-oxidation;
- by the endoplasmic reticulum through the ω-oxidation.

Mitochondria catalyze the β-oxidation of the bulk of short-, medium-, and long-chain FFAs, and this pathway constitutes the major process by which fatty acids are oxidized to generate energy. Peroxisomes are preferentially involved in the β-oxidation chain shortening of very long-chain fatty acids (Rao and Reddy, 2001). Nevertheless, the peroxisomal pathway is quantitatively minor (Bartlett and Eaton, 2004). Short- and medium-chain fatty acids freely enter mitochondria; on the contrary, long-chain fatty acids are activated to acyl-CoA esters targeted to esterification or to mitochondrial β-oxidation. Mitochondrial β-oxidation can be divided into two main steps:

1. the process of getting acyl groups into the mitochondrion for oxidation;
2. intramitochondrial chain shortening by oxidative removal of two-carbon (acetyl) units.

Long-chain fatty acids, activated to acyl-CoA esters, cannot directly cross the mitochondrial inner membrane, and the mitochondrial gate is a major point for the control and regulation of the β-oxidation (Schulz, 1991). Transfer across the mitochondrial membrane involves three different steps: (1) the transference of the acyl group from CoA to carnitine, catalyzed by carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1 (CPT1), (2) the intermembrane transport, catalyzed by acylcarnitine translocase, and (3) the reconversion to acyl-CoA ester intramitochondrially in the inner face of the inner membrane by the CPT2 (Fig. 1). CPT1, being the mitochondrial gateway for fatty acids, is the main controller of the hepatic β-oxidation flux (Eaton, 2002); its activity is inhibited by malonyl-CoA, the product of the first step of fatty acids synthesis. β-Oxidation involves four individual reactions that generate reducing equivalents (NADH or FADH₂), which can then be oxidized to H₂O by the mitochondrial respiratory chain. The energy produced is harnessed in the form of ATP by the oxidative phosphorylation system (OxyPhos) coupled with the transfer of electrons along the respiratory chain.

2.2. β-Oxidation alterations during NASH

During NASH, hepatocytes are overloaded of FFAs, but the liver does not enlarge indefinitely; the hepatocytes reach a new energetic steady state, whereby the increased hepatic uptake and synthesis of FFAs are compensated by an increased hepatic removal of fatty acids. This can be achieved by different mechanisms. Obviously, the increased uptake of FFAs can be compensated by an enhanced removal. Patients with NASH present increased mitochondrial β-oxidation of fatty acids (Sanyal et al., 2001) and enhanced β-oxidation is also found in ob/ob mice presenting massive steatosis (Brady et al., 1985). The enhanced β-oxidation has been confirmed *in vivo* by using sodium ¹³C-octanoate breath test (Miele et al., 2003). In addition, a recent study

Fig. 1. Mitochondria fat metabolism and energy production. Mitochondrial β-oxidation involves 3 steps; the first step is the transfer of the acyl group from the long-chain fatty acid to carnitine and then the transport into the matrix; the second step is the intramitochondrial chain shortening by oxidative removal of two-carbon (acetyl) units in the β-oxidation and conversion of NAD⁺ and FAD into NADH and FADH₂; the final step is the re-oxidation of NADH and FADH₂ by mitochondrial respiratory chain. Long-chain fatty acids cannot directly cross the mitochondrial inner membrane. Transfer across the mitochondrial membrane involves three different steps: (1) the transfer of the acyl group from CoA to carnitine, catalyzed by carnitine palmitoyl transferase I (CPT1), (2) the intermembrane transport, catalyzed by acylcarnitine translocase, and (3) the reversion to acyl-CoA ester intramitochondrially in the inner face of the inner membrane by the CPT2. Respiratory chain is also represented. Reducing equivalents generated from beta-oxidation enter the mitochondrial respiratory chain to produce the proton motive force necessary for the ATP production.

shows that oxidation of both palmitic and lignoceric acids is significantly increased in a rodent model of NASH (Garcia-Ruiz et al., 2006). NASH may develop under conditions that cause prolonged steatosis; the common mechanism could be an impaired mitochondrial β-oxidation of fatty acids, which may result from different causes (Fromenty and Pessayre, 1995).

A second important mechanism could be the enhanced CPT1 activity to increase the transport of long-chain fatty acids to β-oxidation. In a rodent model of steatosis, CPT1 expression seems to be increased (Brady et al., 1985; Lee et al., 2001; Paterson et al., 2004). In addition, PPARγ activated by FFAs, may activate CPT1 expression. Currently, there are few data about the changes occurring in CPT1 activity during NASH and no data are

available on the change of the activity and/or expression of CPT1 during progression from steatosis to NASH. Perez-Carreras et al. (2003) reported no difference in the CPT1 activity in the liver of 26 NASH patients as compared to controls. However, Nakamura et al. (2005) evaluated fatty acid metabolism-related gene expression in NASH patients, finding a great increase of genes responsible for *de novo* synthesis of fatty acids, but a decrease of CPT1 expression. In a rodent nutritional model of NASH we observed a significant reduction of CPT1 activity in the first phase of disease, counteracted by its decreased sensibility to malonyl-CoA. Very interestingly, the reduction of CPT1 activity seems related to the nitration of the protein (Serviddio et al., 2006). Thus, liver mitochondria β-oxidation seems to be enhanced in NASH, but triglycerides accumulation may be the product of an increased *de novo* synthesis and impaired transport of FFAs into mitochondria.

### 3. NASH induces alterations in mitochondria bioenergetics and ATP homeostasis

#### 3.1. Mitochondrial respiratory chain activity and ATP synthesis

The mitochondrial respiratory chain consists of four respiratory complexes (I–IV) able to convert reduced substrates (NADH or FADH₂) into oxidised cofactors (NAD⁺ and FAD); during their oxidation, NADH and FADH₂ transfer their electrons to the first complexes of the respiratory chain. The electron transfer through complexes I, III and IV is linked to the proton pumping from the matrix into the intermembrane space. Complex V is the ATP synthase (Navarro and Boveris, 2007) (Fig. 1).

FFAs oxidation consists in conversion of NAD⁺eFAD into NADH and FADH₂, which are re-converted by the mitochondrial respiratory chain. According to the chemiosmotic theory of Mitchell, the electron transfer along the respiratory chain is coupled with pumping of protons from the matrix to the mitochondrial intermembrane space, generating a membrane potential (∆Ψ) (Nicholls and Ferguson, 1992). When energy is needed, protons re-enter the matrix through the F₀ portion of ATP synthase, causing the rotation of a molecular rotor in the F₁ portion of ATP synthase and the conversion of ADP into ATP.

The rate of mitochondrial respiration depends on ADP availability to ATP synthase. The gradients of ADP and ATP across the inner membrane are equilibrated by the adenine nucleotide translocase activity, which extrudes ATP from the mitochondria in exchange for cytosolic ADP.

#### 3.2. Mitochondrial oxidative impairment during NASH

Caldwell et al. (1999) documented ultrastructural mitochondrial abnormalities in patients with NASH, which are indicative of defective oxidative phosphorylation. However, in platelet-derived mitochondria of NASH patients, they found normal activity of complex I and complex III. Moreover, Sanyal et al. (2001) failed to find any defects in the mitochondrial respiratory chain enzymes expression in the muscle of a NASH patient. However, Haque and Sanyal (2002) reported that NASH is associated with decreased complex IV activity. Recently, Perez-Carreras et al. (2003) demonstrated a lower activity of the five respiratory complexes in patients with NASH. Even if data from patients are interesting, they are not conclusive. Moreover, data about the modifications of the respiratory chain along NASH development are still lacking. Haque and Sanyal also reported that mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is severely depleted in patients with NASH and it has been demonstrated that can affect mitochondrial function (Fromenty and Pessayre, 1995) and also induces steatosis (Brinkman et al., 1998), but data need to be confirmed. Other studies have reported an increased electron transport activity in mitochondrial respiratory chain (MRC) in liver of obese mice (Chavin et al., 1999), suggesting an adaptive response of mitochondria to enhance the capacity of substrates oxidation. Our data support this suggestion (Serviddio et al., 2008).

#### 3.3. Oxidative phosphorylation (OxyPhos) is compromised in NASH liver

Hepatocytes synthesize ATP mainly by two routes: (1) by glycolysis in the cytosol, and (2) by oxidative phosphorylation (OxyPhos) in the inner mitochondrial membrane. Using glucose as substrate, OxyPhos yields 17 times more ATP than glycolysis. Therefore, OxyPhos represents the main source of ATP in aerobic organisms.
The rate of ATP synthesis, according to its utilization, is controlled by a feedback named “respiratory control”. On the other hand, the respiratory control is the mechanism which adapts the rate of ATP synthesis by OxyPhos to the rate of ATP utilization. OxyPhos is controlled by the mitochondrial genome which, in contrast to the nuclear genome, is only inherited by the mother (Wallace, 1992a). It is generally accepted that mtDNA plays a major role in human diseases and aging, due to slow decrease of the capacity of OxyPhos in mitochondria (Kadenbach et al., 1995; Linnane et al., 1989; Wallace, 1992b).

Patients with NASH have impaired liver ATP homeostasis, as they are unable to recover from a modest ATP-depleting challenge; the activity of Complex V (ATP synthase) is markedly reduced of about 40% in liver of NASH patients compared to controls and the impairment of ATP synthase well correlated with the stage of fibrosis (Perez-Carreras et al., 2003). In an experimental model of liver steatosis, Chavin et al. (1999) applied the nuclear magnetic resonance to monitor changes in the ATP levels of the liver over time. They demonstrated that a modest ischemic insult depletes ATP of hepatocytes, which are unable to restore the ATP pool. In a nutritional model of liver steatosis, we also observed a significant reduction of liver ATP content (Vendemiale et al., 2001). Very recently, we have monitored the possible change in the activity of ATP synthase during the development of steatosis to NASH and we observed no modification in the intrinsic activity of the complex V at any time of liver disease. However, the hepatic ATP depletion was confirmed (Serviddio et al., 2007a). The mechanism accountable for the ATP homeostasis alteration is not known.

We reported the oxidative modification of the βF₁ subunit of the Complex V as possible mechanism of ATP depletion (Vendemiale et al., 2001). These data have not been confirmed elsewhere.

### 3.4. Mitochondrial ROS production and lipid peroxidation

Mitochondria are considered the main quantitative source of free radicals in mammalian liver (Chance et al., 1979). For most electrons that travel down the respiratory chain, complex IV is the final destination where molecular oxygen is converted into water by four-electron reduction. The superoxide anion radical (O₂⁻) is a by-product of normal respiration through the one-electrons reduction of molecular oxygen at early junctures of mitochondrial respiration (complex I or III) (Lenaz, 2001); it is then converted to H₂O₂ by superoxide dismutase (Loschen et al., 1974). In normal conditions, from 0.15% to a few percent of the totally consumed oxygen yields superoxide (St Pierre et al., 2002), but this amount may significantly increase in particular conditions. Any major imbalance between outward proton translocation and ATP synthesis is reflected in an increased membrane potential (∆Ψ). Mitochondrial hyperpolarization prolongs the half-life of mobile electron carriers that will mediate partial reduction of oxygen and generate superoxide (Skulachev, 1998). Thus, the respiratory chain generates ROS even in healthy mitochondria. However, in the physiological state, mitochondrial ROS are detoxified into water, and only a small amount of residual of ROS persists.

ROS are relatively short-lived molecules that exert local effects. However, they can attack polyunsaturated fatty acids and initiate lipid peroxidation within the cell, which results in the formation of aldehyde by-products such as 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE) and malondialdehyde (MDA) (Poli and Schaur, 2000). These molecules have longer half-lives than ROS and have the potential to diffuse from their site of origin to reach distant intracellular and extracellular targets, thereby amplifying the effects of oxidative stress.

Production of ROS correlates with ∆Ψ and both can be reduced by artificial uncouplers (Okuda et al., 1992). Small changes of ∆Ψ have large effects on rates of superoxide production (Korshunov et al., 1997; Miwa et al., 2003). It is currently unknown whether residual ROS have physiological roles, but recent data suggest that H₂O₂ and HNE are able to function as signalling molecules, allowing communication between the mitochondria and the cytosol (Echtay et al., 2003).

### 3.5. Mitochondrial redox imbalance during NASH

In NASH, ROS are generated by the mitochondrial respiratory chain and CYP2E1 (Begriche et al., 2006). ROS and reactive nitrogen species directly damage mtDNA, respiratory chain polypeptides and mitochondrial cardiolipin (Demeilliers et al., 2002). Moreover, ROS cause nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB) activation, which induces the synthesis of TNFα (Yin et al., 2001). Several studies have demonstrated oxidative stress during NASH (Oliveira et al., 2002; Yang et al., 2000). Sreekumar et al. evidenced a transcriptional or pretranscrip-
tional basis for attenuated mitochondrial capacity for the dismutation of ROS in patients with histologically progressive NASH (Sreekumar et al., 2003). Most recently, Laurent et al. (2004) described deleterious effects of superoxide anions in NASH and pointed out the potential interest of nonpeptidyl mimics of superoxide dismutase in the treatment of NASH in humans. ROS activate c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), which regulates hepatocellular injury and insulin resistance; it has been recently reported that activation of hepatic JNK, c-Jun, and AP-1 signalling occurred with the development of NASH (Schattenberg et al., 2006). Very interestingly, it has been recently proposed that serotonin degradation plays a role in the pathogenesis of NASH, causing an increased hepatic production of ROS and lipid peroxides (Nocito et al., 2007). Patients with NASH also exhibit reduced hepatic glutathione content, SOD and catalase activities (Videla et al., 2004). In human livers mRNA expression of antioxidant enzymes is down-regulated in patients with non-alcoholic cirrhosis compared to viral or primary biliary cirrhosis (Sreekumar et al., 2003). On the contrast, Lickteig et al. (2007) described an up-regulation of the genes of the antioxidant response in a rodent model of NASH.

A fast and wide derangement of the ATP homeostasis system seems to be unlike, considering the regulation of the mitochondrial “respiratory control”, thinly perfected by cells in millions of years of aerobic cohabitation.

Recent observations suggest a new possible mechanism which involves alternative substrates oxidation pathway when fat accumulation induces high substrate supply exceeding the energy requirement.

## 4. Mitochondrial uncoupling reduces the ATP efficiency

### 4.1. Mitochondrial uncoupling as part of a strategy to maintain ATP homeostasis

Mitochondrial ATP synthesis depends on coupling of sequential oxido-reductions occurring in the respiratory chain with phosphorylation of ADP. Uncoupling proteins (UCPs) uncouple mitochondria respiration from oxidative phosphorylation, leading to dissipation of the proton gradient generated by the respiratory chain, producing heat instead of ATP (Terada, 1990) (Fig. 2 – normal liver). Multiple substances could degrade proton gradient across the membrane: these include classical uncouplers (Heytler, 1980; Terada, 1990), fatty acids (Kohnke et al., 1993) and the uncoupling proteins (Boss et al., 1998; Kadenbach, 2003).

In physiological conditions, the pumping of protons from the matrix to the intermembrane space of mitochondria generates a proton gradient that, together with the electron transport along the respiratory chain, produces a potential difference across the inner mitochondrial membrane that can be measured (Serviddio et al., 2007b). This mitochondrial membrane potential is the driving force for ATP synthesis at complex V. In fact, the mitochondrial membrane is almost completely impermeable to protons, which can re-enter into the matrix just across the ATP synthase which uses the protons to rotate the subunit F₁ of complex V and to convert ADP in ATP. Any action able to permeabilize the mitochondrial membrane reduces the mitochondrial potential and thus the ATP synthesis. Measurement of mitochondrial membrane potential as function of oxygen consumption allows the analysis of the proton leak across the membrane (Porter and Brand, 1993).

The involvement of UCPs in steatosis and NASH has been proposed by several authors. Increased hepatic expression of UCP2 has been reported in genetically obese ob/ob mice (Chavin et al., 1999). UCP2 is up-regulated in the liver during pathological conditions associated with elevated plasma fatty acid levels and steatosis (Baffy et al., 2002; Starkel et al., 2003). Genetically or ethanol induced fatty liver seems able to induce expression of UCP2 (Rashid et al., 1999). However, Baffy et al. (2002) reported that lack of UCP2 expression in the liver of ob/ob mice does not affect the severity of fatty liver disease. In another work, the same authors observed that UCP2 increases the FAS-mediated liver injury in the same animals, suggesting a significant role for the cell-specific distribution of UCP2 (Fulop et al., 2006). Taken together, these data suggest that UCP2 expression may represent part of the mitochondrial strategy to preserve both ATP homeostasis and fatty acids removal.

### 4.2. UCP2 limits mitochondria hydrogen peroxide production and promotes chronic ATP depletion

Some years ago, Skulachev (1998) suggested that UCPs, by constraining mitochondrial ROS production, could be the response of mitochondria to the risk of oxidative stress. They play important roles in protection from oxidative stress (Negre-Salvayre et al., 1997) and in regulating apoptosis (Lee et al., 1999; Rashid et al., 1999).

FFAs overload                                          Normal substrate supply

Fig. 2. A mechanism of the interaction among UCP2, respiratory chain and redox balance to control fatty acid removal and prevent oxidative stress in NASH liver mitochondria. Steatosis increases the substrate supply that exceeds the energy requirements (1); this increases the O₂ pressure in the mitochondrial matrix and the rate of ROS production (2) that may act as positive signal on an uncoupling agent (3); uncoupling the substrates oxidation from ATP synthesis reduces the redox pressure on the respiratory chain and ROS formation (4) but also induces chronic ATP depletion (5). When hepatocytes face an acute injury, the ATP synthesis is dangerously compromised and, despite the favourable effects, mitochondrial uncoupling exposes the hepatocytes to increased susceptibility when the hepatic energy requirement changes. Abbreviations: FFAs, free fatty acids; UCPs, uncoupling proteins; ΔΨ, mitochondrial membrane potential; H₂O₂, hydrogen peroxide; O₂⁻, superoxide anion.

The rate of mitochondrial H₂O₂ production is dependent on the metabolic state and it is inversely related to the coupling between respiratory chain and ATP synthesis (Boveris et al., 1972). H₂O₂ production is low when the respiration rate is maximal. Thus, production of mitochondrial ROS correlates with membrane potential and both can be reduced by artificial uncouplers (Okuda et al., 1992). Furthermore, small changes of membrane potential have large effects on the rate of superoxide production (Miwa et al., 2003). Our data confirm the role of UCP2 in limiting the mitochondria ROS production (Serviddio et al., 2007b). Nevertheless, mitochondrial H₂O₂ generation does not increase progressively upon NASH development, as it occurs in other liver disease such as biliary cirrhosis (Serviddio et al., 2004). This may be due to UCP2 up-regulation that limits mitochondria oxidative stress in NASH hepatocytes (Negre-Salvayre et al., 1997).

Thus, hepatocytes actively express UCP2 which might be one of the essential capabilities for cytoprotection to rescue themselves from the oxidative stress unless the stress disappears.
The potential effect of UCPs on ATP homeostasis is supported by several studies. However, a definitive demonstration is still lacking. UCP2 over-expression is accountable for the hepatocytes ATP depletion in obese steatotic liver (Chavin et al., 1999), during exposition to lipopolysaccharide (Faggioni et al., 1998; Hatanoe et al., 1996) and in CCl4 toxicity (Donthamsetty et al., 2007) because UCP2 induces inability of replenish ATP and is responsible for hepatocytes cell cycle arrest.

Since the loss of ATP synthesis occurs early in steatosis, many compensating systems are quickly activated to maintain energy supply, *i.e.* increasing respiratory chain activity, cytochromes synthesis and mitochondrial biogenesis (Nisoli et al., 2004). If these mechanisms fail and ATP synthesis is not rapidly restored, the respiratory chain is overloaded and this paradoxically may increase ROS formation.

### 4.3. Mitochondrial uncoupling and the myth of Janus: the two faces of UCPs

In Roman mythology, Janus was the god of gates, doors, doorways, beginnings and endings. Though he was usually depicted with two faces looking in opposite directions.

The molecular mechanisms that are involved in the UCPs induction are unknown. Several independent observations seem to suggest an intriguing hypothesis that reflects the myth of Janus. Free radicals may oxidise polyunsaturated fatty acyl groups of membrane phospholipids producing various aldehydes such HNE, which is one of the most reactive mediators of free radical damage (Poli, 2000). Recently, Echtay et al. reported that HNE, but not other aldehydes, may activate UCP2, inducing mitochondrial uncoupling that in turn reduces H₂O₂ production (Echtay et al., 2003).

On the other hand, hepatocytes could activate UCP2 during steatosis progression as a defensive response against the increased oxidative stress. UCP2, by uncoupling the oxidative phosphorylation, diminishes the redox pressure on the mitochondrial electron transport providing an advantage by limiting mitochondrial ROS production. This mechanism permits mitochondria to elevate FFAs removal and to reduce redox pressure, acting as a protective mechanism against oxidative damage (Fig. 2. – NASH liver).

However UCP2, by decreasing the efficiency of energy synthesis, compromises the capacity of the liver to respond to an acute energy need. These changes may not become manifest unless the liver faces additional challenges, such as infections or toxic injury that require high ATP supply.

## 5. Mitochondrial function is a key target in the signal program of fatty acids removal

PPARα activates a program of target gene expression involved in fatty acids uptake β-oxidation, transport into peroxisomes and ω-oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids. PPARα is strongly involved in regulation of the mitochondrial β-oxidation key enzymes, such as CPT1 (Brandt et al., 1998; Mascaro et al., 1998; Yu et al., 1998) and medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) genes (Gulick et al., 1994). PPARα-induced fatty acids catabolism might prevent hepatic fat deposition (Ip et al., 2003, 2004; Shulman and Mangelsdorf, 2005; Yki-Jarvinen, 2004).

Recently, Svegliati-Baroni et al. (2006) demonstrated that a supplementation of n-3 PUFA ameliorates fatty liver and the degree of liver injury in a rodent model of NASH. On the other side, several studies have demonstrated that PPARγ hepatic overexpression is closely associated with the development of NASH (Tontonoz et al., 1994; Uto et al., 2005). PPARγ agonists up-regulate the expression of lipid-related genes, including fatty acid transporters and UCP2 (Spiegelman, 1998).

However, treatment of ob/ob mice with rosiglitazone, an agonist of PPARγ, did not reverse histological lesions of NASH or improve MRC activity, but rosiglitazone reduced activity of complex I and increased oxidative stress and liver steatosis (Garcia-Ruiz et al., 2007).

It has been described that PPARα activation in mice induces liver UCP2 expression (Kelly et al., 1998). The available data suggest a major role for PPARα in the regulation of UCP2 expression in the liver whereas, in some particular pathophysiological situations, additional pathways may be involved, probably related to PPARδ and PPARγ (Villarroya et al., 2006).

Transcriptional coactivators are also supposed to play a major role in mitochondrial function during NASH. PPARγ coactivator-1 alpha (PGC1α) is activated by signals that control energy and nutrient homeostasis (Puigserver and Spiegelman, 2003). PGC1α is induced in liver in response to fasting, and it activates key
genes of the fasting response, including the genes of the fatty acids β-oxidation (Herzig et al., 2001). Moreover, it is well known that PGC1α induces and coordinates gene expression which stimulates mitochondrial biogenesis and regulates mitochondrial respiratory capacity (Wu et al., 1999).

Recent evidences suggest that also PGC1β is able to control mitochondrial oxidative energy metabolism in animal models (Sonoda et al., 2007), but no data are available on its function in NASH pathogenesis.

## 6. Mitochondrial function as a target of pharmacological treatment of NASH

Metformin is a biguanide extensively used in the treatment of diabetes and recently in the therapy of metabolic syndrome (Kirpichnikov et al., 2002; Marchesini et al., 2001). Biguanides activate AMP kinase (AMPK) in liver (Zhou et al., 2001) which in turn inactivates acyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), thus decreasing malonyl-CoA levels and reduces the inhibition on CPT1 (Winder and Hardie, 1999). AMPK activation can directly activate CPT1 (Velasco et al., 1998). Moreover, Winder et al. (2000) reported that the metformin-dependent activation of AMPK also increased expression of enzymes of the tricarboxylic acid cycle and the respiratory chain. Metformin is also able to inhibit mitochondrial permeability transition (MPTP) that is involved in cell apoptosis (Guigas et al., 2004). To date, the effects of metformin in NASH have been evaluated only in diabetics. All these effects should be verified in vivo in humans and in animal models of NASH. Thiazolidinediones (TZDs) are a class of insulin-sensitizing drugs used for the treatment of insulin resistance. They act as PPARγ ligands and have been used for the treatment of obese NASH patients (Promrat et al., 2004). The positive effect of TZDs on NASH seems to be related to its effective capacity to sensitize the cells to insulin. In fact, part of their effect is mediated by AMPK activation. Colca et al. (2004) reported that TZDs interact with novel proteins localized in the inner mitochondrial membrane and could be responsible for the inhibition of complex I. Whether the positive effect of TZDs in NASH progression may be independent from the insulin resistance wait to be elucidated. Fibrates act as PPARα activators, but their effect on NASH progression lacks to be clarified. It has been reported that fibrates activate fatty acids oxidation stimulating CPT1 activity and inducing expression of enzymes involved in β-oxidation (Ip et al., 2004). They also increase the expression of different mitochondrial DNA encoded enzymes (Cai et al., 1996; Nagai et al., 2002) and activates mitochondrial transcription factor A (mtTFA) which controls the mitochondrial biogenesis (Nagai et al., 2002). Experimental studies exploring the effect of these drugs during NASH progression should be encouraged. Vitamin E, a potent antioxidant, could be useful in NASH (Dufour, 2007). A vitamin E derivative, Trolox, has been reported to prevent mitochondrial dysfunction induced by extramitochondrial oxidative stress (Tapner et al., 2004). A silybin–vitamin E complex has been tested in a pilot study in an Italian cohort of NAFLD patients (Loguercio et al., 2007). The authors reported a significant improvement of liver enzymes levels, hyperinsulinemia, and indexes of liver fibrosis in treated patients. Although these data are not conclusive and the mechanisms of protection should be almost completely defined, these antioxidant drugs promise to be effective in NASH treatment. Other drugs used in NASH treatment act on mitochondrial function. We demonstrated that ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) increases mitochondrial levels of reduced glutathione (GSH) up-regulating γ-glutamyl cysteine synthetase, a rate limiting enzyme involved in GSH synthesis (Serviddio et al., 2004). In addition, we reported that UDCA preserves mitochondrial membrane potential and cardiolipin content in cirrhotic rats (Serviddio et al., 2004). Whereas animal studies have consistently demonstrated beneficial effects using multiple antioxidants as vitamin E, vitamin E and C, ursodeoxycholic acid, N-acetylcysteine (Samuhasaneeto et al., 2007) and also melatonin (Pan et al., 2006), human studies have not similarly produced encouraging results. Antioxidant therapy seems to be the most promising strategy to improve liver function because of its high tolerability. Studies specifically designed to address these points are requested.

## 7. Conclusions

NASH is a metabolic disorder of the liver dependent on the new life-style habits combining rich diet and lack of exercise. Though once believed to be an innocent condition, it has become evident that NASH can progress to cirrhosis, liver failure and hepatocellular carcinoma.

There are consistent evidences that mitochondrial dysfunction plays a central role in NASH whatever its origin. Mitochondria are probably the key controller of fatty acids removal and this is part of an intensive
gene program that modify hepatocytes to counteract the excessive fat storage. Mitochondrial dysfunction participates at different levels in NASH pathogenesis. It is not clear whether some changes observed in experimental studies are the expression of NASH damage or rather represent the adaptation of the cell to the new metabolic condition. In the present review we have suggested that mitochondrial respiratory chain, UCP 2 and redox balance cooperate in a common pathway which permits to set down the redox pressure, limit the risk of oxidative damage and, allows the maximal rate of fat removal. When an acute insult requiring high energy supply occurs, some of these cycles hamper the hepatocytes to defend themselves. Some of our suggestions need to be confirmed. The redox control of UCP2 from HNE is now lacking and the impairment of mitochondrial biogenesis has to be completely elucidated. We should expect new data in the next years about the role of transcription factors in mitochondrial dysfunction and mitochondrial biogenesis in NASH progression.
