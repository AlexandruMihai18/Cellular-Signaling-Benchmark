Insulin secretion is regulated by a series of complex events generated by various intracellular signals including Ca²⁺, ATP, cAMP and phospholipid-derived signals. Glucose-stimulated insulin secretion is the principal mode of insulin secretion, and the mechanism potentiating the secretion is critical for physiological responses. Among the various intracellular signals involved, cAMP is particularly important for amplifying insulin secretion. Recently, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogues and dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV) inhibitors have been developed as new antidiabetic drugs. These drugs all act through cAMP signalling in pancreatic β-cells. Until recently, cAMP was generally thought to potentiate insulin secretion through protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylation of proteins associated with the secretory process. However, it is now known that in addition to PKA, cAMP has other targets such as Epac (also referred to as cAMP-GEF). The variety of the effects mediated by cAMP signalling may be linked to cAMP compartmentation in the pancreatic β-cells.

Introduction

Insulin secretion is regulated by a series of complex events including metabolism of nutrients, generation of intracellular signals, electrical activity, influx and mobilization of Ca²⁺, and exocytosis of insulin granules [1,2]. Nutrients such as glucose, amino acids and fatty acids, hormones such as incretins, and neural inputs generate intracellular signals [3–7]. The major intracellular signals include ATP, cAMP, phospholipid-derived molecules and influx and mobilization of Ca²⁺ [2,8–11]. Although a rise in cytoplasmic calcium ([Ca²⁺]i) is the primary signal in triggering insulin secretion, other signals are also important for normal regulation of the secretion. Among the intracellular signals, cAMP is especially important for potentiation of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Recently, GLP-1 analogues and DPP-IV inhibitors have been developed as new antidiabetic drugs [6]. These drugs all potentiate insulin secretion through cAMP signalling. However, how cAMP signalling modulates the insulin secretory processes is largely unknown.

cAMP is a universal intracellular messenger involved in the regulation of various cellular functions in many cell types. In secretory cells including neuronal, neuroendocrine, endocrine and exocrine cells, cAMP is an important signal in the regulation of neurotransmitter, hormone and enzyme secretion. cAMP action in insulin secretion has long been known to be mediated through phosphorylation by PKA [8,12,13] of proteins associated with the secretory process. However, recent studies have shown that cAMP also potentiates insulin secretion by PKA-independent mechanisms involving the cAMP-binding protein Epac2 (exchange protein activated

by cAMP2) [also called cAMP-GEF (cAMP-regulated guanine nucleotide exchange factor) II] (referred to herein as Epac) [14–16]. In this review, we will discuss the diverse roles of cAMP signalling in insulin granule exocytosis, based primarily on our recent findings.

### Incretins Potentiate Insulin Secretion Through cAMP Signalling in Pancreatic β-cells

It is clinically well known that glucose administered via the gastrointestinal tract induces a greater induction of insulin secretion than a comparable glucose challenge given intravenously [17,18]. Gastrointestinal hormones, the incretins including GLP-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide [originally called gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP)], are responsible for this so-called incretin effect [3,6]. In response to the ingestion of nutrients, GLP-1 and GIP are released from gastrointestinal endocrine L-cells and K-cells respectively [19]. Both of these hormones then potentiate glucose-stimulated insulin secretion [20] by binding to their specific guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G-protein)-coupled receptors in the pancreatic β-cell membrane and increasing cAMP production through activation of adenylyl cyclase [21–23]. In fact, we have found that both GLP-1- and GIP-induced cAMP production in islets is completely blocked by treatment with MDL12330A, an adenylyl cyclase inhibitor, and that both GLP-1- and GIP-potentiated insulin secretions are markedly reduced [24]. These findings indicate that both GLP-1- and GIP-potentiated insulin secretions depend critically on cAMP production in β-cells. However, those by cAMP occur only at glucose concentrations above a certain level [25]. cAMP has been shown to act on insulin secretion at various steps [3,26,27]. In normal pancreatic islets, the *in vitro* concentration dependence of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion displays a sigmoidal curve [28], in which a glucose concentration exceeding 6 mmol/l is required for triggering insulin secretion. On the other hand, a study in man has shown that GLP-1 infusion induces a significant increase in insulin secretion even at fasting glucose levels of around 5.1 mmol/l [29]. In addition, it has been reported that GLP-1 renders glucose-insensitive β-cells glucose-competent, probably by modulating K$_{\text{ATP}}$ channel activity [30]. These findings suggest a mechanism by which cAMP might induce glucose responsiveness of pancreatic β-cells. Using a pancreatic perfusion system, we recently found that pretreatment with GLP-1 or GIP improved glucose responsiveness in K$_{\text{ATP}}$ channel-deficient (Kir6.2$^{-/-}$) mice in which almost no insulin

secretion in response to glucose is detected [26]: the effect of GLP-1 was stronger. These findings suggest that activation of cAMP signalling induces glucose responsiveness in K$_{\text{ATP}}$ channel-deficient β-cells while also showing the importance of incretins in the induction of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion independently of the normal requirement for closure of the K$_{\text{ATP}}$ channels.

#### Critical Role of Niflumic Acid-sensitive Ion Channels in Induction of Glucose Responsiveness by cAMP

We have found that insulin secretion induced by a combination of cAMP plus glucose at high concentrations induces insulin secretion in pancreas of Kir6.2$^{-/-}$ mice, which is blocked by the application of niflumic acids, suggesting that niflumate-sensitive ion channels participate in the induction of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion by cAMP. Thus, cAMP acts not only as a potentiator of insulin secretion, but appears to be permissive for glucose-stimulated insulin secretion via niflumic-sensitive ion channels. Niflumic acid is known to block Cl$^-$ channels, but also targets non-selective cation channels such as transient receptor potential (TRP) channels [31]. It is still unknown if any of these channels is responsible in the abolishment of the cAMP effect by niflumic acid.

Induction of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion by cAMP can be evoked either by extracellular Ca$^{2+}$ influx through voltage-dependent Ca$^{2+}$ channels (VDCCs) or by intracellular Ca$^{2+}$ release from the endoplasmic reticulum. We have found that thapsigargin failed to block cAMP-induced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion while nifedipine completely abolished it [27], indicating that membrane depolarization mediated by ion channels or transporters is involved in the process.

To clarify the role of cAMP in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion under physiological conditions, we increased the glucose concentration in a stepwise manner in the presence or absence of cAMP in the perfused pancreas. Interestingly, these small increases in the glucose concentration failed to trigger insulin secretion in the absence of the cAMP analogue 8-bromo-cAMP or GLP-1, but dramatically evoked insulin secretion in its presence. Such glucose-stimulated insulin secretion was almost completely abolished by treatment with niflumic acid. Considering that blood glucose concentrations increase gradually after meal ingestion from 4–5 mmol/l to less than 8.0 mmol/l [32] with concomitant rises in incretin levels, the induction of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion by cAMP may have an important role in maintaining the blood glucose level within the

physiological range. Thus, niflumic-sensitive channels would seem to be critically involved in the mechanism of induction of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion by cAMP in the physiological state.

# The Dynamics of Insulin Granule Exocytosis

Insulin granule exocytosis proceeds in several steps including recruitment, docking and fusion to the plasma membrane. However, the precise mechanisms of exocytosis induced by various secretagogues such as glucose and potassium are still unknown. Recently, investigation of insulin granule dynamics has been refined by use of the total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM) system. To monitor the dynamics of the process of insulin granule exocytosis, insulin fused with fluorescent protein such as enhanced green or yellow fluorescent proteins (EGFP or Venus) is introduced to isolated β-cells or insulin-secreting cell lines [33–35]. Using primary cultured pancreatic β-cells, we analysed insulin granule dynamics induced by various stimuli in detail and found that the exocytic process can be classified into three modes: mode 1, in which predocked granules are immediately fused to the plasma membrane by stimulation (*old face*); mode 2, in which granules are newly recruited by stimulation and immediately fused (a docking state can hardly be detected by TIRFM) to the plasma membrane (*restless newcomer*); and mode 3, in which granules are newly recruited by stimulation, but are first paused or docked and then fused to the plasma membrane (*resting newcomer*) (table 1) [34].

We then assessed Ca²⁺-triggered insulin granule fusion events in β-cells stimulated with potassium (60 mmol/l). Fusion events caused by potassium stimulation occur immediately after stimulation but are transient. More than 60% of these granules are *old face* or predocked granules. In contrast, fusion events induced by glucose stimulation are biphasic: a first phase of acute increase and a second phase of sustained increase. Interestingly, both phases of fusion events caused by glucose stimulation (16.7 mM) involve mostly *restless newcomer* granules. Thus, different dynamics of insulin granule exocytosis are characteristic of potassium stimulation and glucose stimulation. In particular, the difference between the first phase of glucose- and potassium-induced fusion events is noteworthy. While potassium-stimulated insulin secretion is induced only by the Ca²⁺ signal, glucose-stimulated insulin secretion is induced by various signals including metabolites as well as Ca²⁺ [36]. The existing model of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion suggests that the first phase results from fusion of insulin granules from a readily releasable pool (RRP) comprising predocked granules (*old face*) [34]; the second phase results from fusion of insulin granules from a reserve pool comprising granules located farther away [11]. Based on our data, we propose a new model of exocytosis in which both phases include newly recruited granules (*restless newcomer*), some from a distance away from the plasma membrane yet readily releasable.

To ascertain which granule pools are involved in glucose and potassium stimulation, β-cells were sequentially treated with the secretagogues under two different protocols. In one protocol, cells were first stimulated with 16.7 mM glucose for 20 min; after a 10-min interval of incubation in 2.8 mM glucose, the cells were stimulated with 60 mM potassium for 5 min (figure 1A). In another protocol, cells were first stimulated with 60 mM potassium for 5 min, and then after a 10-min interval of incubation in 2.8 mM glucose, the cells were stimulated with 16.7 mM glucose for 20 min (figure 1B). In the cells stimulated with high levels of potassium after glucose stimulation, the fusion events occurred immediately and transiently, and were caused mainly by *old face*. By contrast, in the cells stimulated with 16.7 mM glucose after potassium stimulation, both the first and second phases of fusion events caused by glucose stimulation involved mostly *restless newcomer*, similar to those in cells stimulated with glucose without initial potassium stimulation. These results indicate that potassium stimulation and glucose stimulation induce fusion of granules from distinct pools.

Because the TIRFM system under the conditions used detects insulin granules only within 40 nm below the cell surface, it cannot be ruled out that granules responsible for the first phase of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion originate from farther than 40 nm from the cell membrane. To ascertain the number of insulin granules at various distances from the plasma membrane, TIRF images at 40, 60 and 80 nm of penetration depth of evanescent field were acquired by altering the angle of incident light. The number of insulin granules at 60 nm

of depth was found to be similar to that at 40 nm of depth, while the number of insulin granules at 80 nm of depth was markedly increased (figure 2A). The number of insulin granules detected at various levels from the plasma membrane was also determined. The number of granules detected from 50 to 60 nm from the plasma membrane was found to be about double that detected from 40 to 50 nm (figure 2B). TIRFM images are usually acquired at 40 or 50 nm of depth and so it is especially difficult to detect granules more than 50 nm from the plasma membrane when monitoring fusion events. Thus, in both the first and second phases of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, the granule pool providing restless newcomer may well be located more than 50 nm from the plasma membrane. These results indicate that granules located a distance away from the plasma membrane in β-cells are immediately releasable.

### Regulation of Insulin Granule Dynamics by cAMP Signalling

Although it is clear that cAMP potentiates glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, how cAMP acts in the exocytotic processes of recruitment, docking, and fusion of secretory granules, the final step of the secretory pathway, was not known. We therefore examined the regulation of insulin granule dynamics by cAMP

cAMP signalling in insulin secretion

S. Seino et al.

Role of Epac2 (cAMP-GEFII)/Rap1 Signalling in Insulin Secretion

It has long been thought that cAMP regulates the potentiation of insulin secretion through PKA phosphorylation of various proteins associated with the insulin secretory process [8,12,13]. However, it is now known that cAMP potentiates insulin granule exocytosis by PKA-independent as well as PKA-dependent mechanisms, the former involving the cAMP-binding protein Epac2 [37,38]. Two Epacs, Epac1 (also known as cAMP-GEFI) and Epac2 (cAMP-GEFII), have been identified [14,15]. Both Epac proteins possess guanine nucleotide exchange activity towards the small G-proteins Rap1 and Rap2 in a cAMP-dependent manner [14,15]. It has now become apparent that Epac proteins are novel cAMP sensors that regulate several cellular processes independently of PKA. Epac1 messenger RNA (mRNA) is expressed ubiquitously, while Epac2 mRNA is expressed mainly in neurons, neuroendocrine cells and endocrine cells [14,15,38]. Epac1 and Epac2 each are encoded by two genes. Structurally, both Epac proteins have common features: a cAMP-binding domain and DEP (Dishevelled, Egl-10, and Pleckstrin), REM (Ras exchange motif) and GEF domains. However, Epac1 possesses one cAMP-binding domain while Epac2 possesses two cAMP-binding domains. X-ray crystallographic analysis of full-length Epac2 in the absence of cAMP reveals the autoinhibitory control of the C-terminal GEF domain unleashed upon the binding of cAMP [39]. Binding of cAMP to Epac2 is thought to cause conformational changes that elicit GEF activity towards Rap proteins [39]. Recently, a novel splicing variant was found in mouse adrenal glands [40]. This splicing variant, which lacks the N-terminal cAMP-binding domain of the earlier known Epac2, is designated Epac2B (i.e. adrenal type) while Epac2 is now called Epac2A (brain/β-cell type). A previously identified splicing variant, which is specifically expressed in liver, is referred to as Epac2C (liver type) [41].

An Epac-selective cAMP analogue 8-pCPT-2'-O-Me-cAMP has been developed and used as a pharmacological tool to study the functional roles of the Epacs [42,43]. Accumulating evidence has shown that Epacs regulate several cellular functions including integrin-mediated cellular adhesion [44,45], establishment of cell polarity [46], cell migration [47], neurotransmitter release [48,49], enzyme secretion [50], regulation of intracellular signalling by phospholipase Cε [51], hypertrophy [52], Ca²⁺ mobilization [53], neurite growth [43] and endothelial barrier function [44].

In pancreatic islets and β-cell lines, Epac2 participates in the regulation of apoptosis [54] and insulin

signalling using the TIRFM system [34]. When β-cells were treated with 8-bromo-cAMP alone, neither docking nor fusion events of insulin granules occurred. However, addition of 16.7 mM glucose significantly increased the frequency of both first and second phase fusion events, compared with that by stimulation with glucose alone. The sum of fusion events (per 200 μm²) in the first and the second phases showed approximately 1.8-fold increases in both phases by glucose plus 8-bromo-cAMP stimulation compared to glucose alone (figure 3). Interestingly, the potentiation of fusion events by 8-bromo-cAMP was because of the increase in *restless newcomer*. Thus, cAMP signalling may also regulate the exocytotic dynamics of granules located a distance away from the plasma membrane.

secretion [24,38]. We demonstrated that Epac2 mediates potentiation of cAMP-dependent, PKA-independent insulin secretion [24]. More recently, we examined the role of Epac2 in insulin granule dynamics directly in pancreatic β-cells isolated from Epac2-deficient (*Epac2⁻/⁻*) mice using the TIRFM system [34]. We found that potentiation by cAMP of the first phase of glucose-induced fusion events were significantly impaired in *Epac2⁻/⁻* mice. This result indicates that Rap1 signalling is especially important in the first phase of potentiation of insulin granule exocytosis [34]. In addition, Rap1, which is activated by cAMP specifically through Epac2 in pancreatic β-cells, was found to be required for PKA-independent cAMP-potentiated insulin secretion.

Subcellular localization of Epacs is reported to be important for activation of downstream signalling, including Rap1. In human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells, targeting of Epac1 to perinuclear region is required for cAMP-mediated protein kinase B (PKB) activation [55]. However, Epac1 mutants, which are localized in the cytosol, lack its downstream signalling. Epac2A is also localized near the plasma membrane region [40] while the novel splicing variant Epac2B, which lacks the N-terminal cAMP-binding domain, is found in the cytosol. Interestingly, in MIN6 cells stimulated with glucose plus 8-bromo-cAMP, Epac2A participates in triggering hormone secretion, but Epac2B does not. Thus, the proper localization of Epac2A near the plasma membrane is determined by the N-terminal cAMP-binding domain, and is required for fine regulation of insulin secretion by cAMP.

Simulation Model of Insulin Granule Movement

Biosimulation has recently been attempted to create and validate models that describe complex cellular processes. To investigate the possible mechanisms of cAMP signalling in the regulation of insulin granule dynamics, we have developed a simulation model of insulin granule movement [34]. In this model, we applied the three-dimensional random walk process, based on the results of TIRFM analysis. The simulation model suggests that both the density of the insulin granules in the RRP and facilitated recruitment of the granules to the plasma membrane contribute in the first and second phases of glucose-induced fusion events. Because cAMP signalling potentiates both the first phase and the second phase of glucose-induced fusion events, which are caused mainly by *restless newcomer*, cAMP signalling can apparently enhance both the density of the insulin granules in the putative RRP and the recruitment of these granules to the plasma membrane. This is supported by recent findings that both cAMP-induced enhancement of the size of the RRP and acceleration of the refilling of the RRP potentiate insulin granule exocytosis [37,56], and that cAMP increases the frequency of granule movement in β-cell lines [57]. However, when the granule density in the RRP is decreased without changing the conditions of the facilitation of granule recruitment. Potentiation of the first phase but not of the second phase is clearly reduced in simulation analysis. This finding is suggestive of the exocytotic events involving cAMP potentiation in β-cells. Considering these findings together, Epac2A/Rap1 signalling may regulate cAMP-induced

Conclusions

It has been more than 40 years since the discovery of the involvement of cAMP in insulin secretion [59,60]. It has become clear that the activation of cAMP signalling potentiates glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. However, the molecular mechanisms of cAMP-regulated insulin secretion are not fully understood. Indeed, diverse roles of cAMP signalling in insulin secretion have recently been found. For example, we now know that cAMP potentiates insulin granule exocytosis by both PKA-dependent and PKA-independent mechanisms, the latter involving Epac2. We have also found that although GLP-1 and GIP both potentiate insulin secretion through cAMP signalling, the effect of GLP-1 differs from that of GIP in Kir6.2−/− mice in terms of induction of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. These findings strongly suggest cAMP compartmentation in β-cells. Clarification of the molecular basis for such compartmentation is important to better understand the mechanism of insulin secretion, the pathophysiology of diabetes, and the development of antidiabetic drugs. New approaches including analyses using inducible gene knockout mice, bioimaging, mass spectrometry and biosimulation show great promise for research in this field.
