## Abstract

Calcium (Ca²⁺) and phosphate (Pᵢ) are essential to many vital physiological processes. Consequently the maintenance of Ca²⁺ and Pᵢ homeostasis is essential to a healthy existence. This occurs through the concerted action of intestinal, renal, and skeletal regulatory mechanisms. Ca²⁺ and Pᵢ handling by these organs is under tight hormonal control. Disturbances in their homeostasis have been linked to pathophysiological disorders including chronic renal insufficiency, kidney stone formation, and bone abnormalities. Importantly, the kidneys fine-tune the amount of Ca²⁺ and Pᵢ retained in the body by altering their (re) absorption from the glomerular filtrate. The ion transport proteins involved in this process have been studied extensively. Recently, new key players have been identified in the regulation of the Ca²⁺ and Pᵢ balance. Novel regulatory mechanisms and their implications were introduced for the antiaging hormone klotho and fibroblast growth factor member 23 (FGF23). Importantly, transgenic mouse models, exhibiting disturbances in Ca²⁺ and Pᵢ balance, have been of great value in the elucidation of klotho and FGF23 functioning. This review highlights the current knowledge and ongoing research into Ca²⁺ and Pᵢ homeostasis, emphasizing findings from several relevant knockout mouse models.

## Introduction

The tight control of plasma calcium (Ca²⁺) and phosphate (Pᵢ) levels is essential to the performance of many vital physiological functions. Muscle contraction, blood clotting and neuronal excitation all require Ca²⁺, whereas Pᵢ is vital to intracellular signaling, as a component of membrane lipids and to build the backbone of DNA. Moreover, significant elements of bone are Ca²⁺ and Pᵢ (1,2). Several organs contribute to the exquisite regulation of Ca²⁺ and Pᵢ homeostasis by facilitating intestinal absorption, bone (de) mineralization, and renal excretion/reabsorption of both ions. Regulation of these processes occurs by a number of hormones. The biologically active form of vitamin D (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D₃), parathyroid hormone (PTH), and calcitonin have been extensively studied in this regard. More recently,

fibroblast growth factor member 23 (FGF23) and klotho have been identified as new players essential to the regulation of Ca²⁺ and Pᵢ homeostasis (3–5). Remarkably, large alterations in dietary Pᵢ and Ca²⁺ intake produce only small alterations in the circulating levels of these ions due to the combined action of these signaling molecules on bone, intestinal, and renal Ca²⁺ and Pᵢ transport (2,6,7). At times these regulatory processes are overwhelmed producing disturbances in Ca²⁺ and Pᵢ homeostasis. Patients with chronic renal insufficiency (CRI) highlight pathophysiology complicated by altered Ca²⁺ and Pᵢ handling. These individuals have a decreased glomerular filtration rate, a decreased circulating plasma 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D₃ (1,25(OH)₂D₃) level and consequently develop secondary hyperparathyroidism (8). This review highlights the physiological mechanisms governing Ca²⁺ and Pᵢ transport, two intimately

related processes, and the clinical implications of their altered regulation.

# Physiology of Ca²⁺ and Pᵢ homeostasis

Ingested Ca²⁺ and Pᵢ are absorbed by different segments of the small intestine. The active absorption of sodium (Na⁺) throughout the entire course of the intestine results in a large net water absorption. This mainly occurs in the small intestine, where Ca²⁺ and Pᵢ are concomitantly taken up in a passive, paracellular manner, down their concentration gradient. The active transcellular absorption of Pᵢ occurs predominantly from the ileum (9), whereas active Ca²⁺ transport takes place largely from the duodenum (10).

The vast majority of whole body Ca²⁺ and Pᵢ is stored as the mineral hydroxylapatite in the skeleton. In blood 45% of Ca²⁺ is present in a free, ionized form, 45% is bound to proteins, and a small fraction, 10%, forms complexes with anions including citrate, sulphate, and phosphate. Plasma Pᵢ is present in its inorganic form and as a component of several organic substances including sugars, phosphoproteins, and high-energy phosphates. The tightly regulated renal elimination of electrolytes, including Ca²⁺ and Pᵢ, maintains a near constant plasma level of ions and significantly contributes to whole body homeostasis. Free Ca²⁺ and Pᵢ are filtered by the glomerulus and gain entry into the renal tubule. In contrast to the gastrointestinal system, Pᵢ is largely absorbed in a transcellular, Na⁺-dependent manner in the proximal tubule (PT). This process is dependent on the electrochemical gradient present for Na⁺ (11). Renal Ca²⁺ absorption occurs paracellularly in the PT and the thick ascending limb of Henle (TAL). A small (10%–15%) highly regulated amount of Ca²⁺ is actively absorbed from the distal convoluted tubule (DCT) and the connecting tubule (CNT) (10, 11). A diverse array of ion transport proteins, localized to the apical and basolateral membranes of intestinal and renal epithelia, mediate this active transport of Ca²⁺ and Pᵢ. The entry of these ions, from lumina into the cytosol of the specific epithelium, is tightly regulated and represents the rate-limiting step in transcellular Ca²⁺ and Pᵢ (re)absorption (10).

## Key messages

- Maintenance of normal phosphate (Pᵢ) and calcium (Ca²⁺) homeostasis is crucial to many vital physiologic processes including cellular signaling, DNA structure, bone mineralization, muscle contraction, blood clotting, and neuronal excitation.
- Fibroblast growth factor member 23 (FGF23), klotho, parathyroid hormone, and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin-D₃ are key regulators of Ca²⁺ and Pᵢ homeostasis. Their concerted action alters (re)absorption from intestine, kidney, and bone via recently identified pathways.
- The concerted interplay of klotho and FGF23 contributes substantially to the regulation of renal Pᵢ handling and may provide a therapeutic target for chronic renal insufficiency-related hyperphosphatemia and other disorders involving disturbances of Pᵢ balance.

entry mediated by the epithelial Ca²⁺ channel, TRPV6 (12). Ca²⁺ is subsequently shuttled to the basolateral side of the cell via the Ca²⁺-binding protein, calbindin-D₂₈K. This process is completed by transport of Ca²⁺ back into the bloodstream via the plasma membrane Ca²⁺-adenosine triphosphatase (PMCA1b) (13).

The Na⁺-dependent Pᵢ cotransporter type IIb (NaPi-IIb) is localized to the brush border of ileum. There it is responsible for active Pᵢ transport from the intestinal lumen into the blood (9, 14). NaPi-IIb is also present, although to a significantly decreased extent, in duodenum and jejunum, consistent with less overall active Pᵢ reabsorption from these locales (9). The mechanism and identity of the molecules responsible for the extrusion of Pᵢ back into the blood is not known at present.

After intestinal absorption into the blood, Ca²⁺ and Pᵢ are filtered across the glomerulus into the tubular lumen of the nephron. Along the course of the nephron passive, paracellular Ca²⁺ absorption occurs from the PT and TAL. A three-step process mediates the active Ca²⁺ reabsorption mechanism from the DCT and CNT. First, Ca²⁺ enters the cell via the epithelial Ca²⁺ channel TRPV5 (and to a lesser extent TRPV6). Then Ca²⁺ diffuses through the cytosol via calbindin-D₂₈K, to the basolateral side of the cell. There, Ca²⁺ is extruded into the peritubular capillary by the Na⁺-Ca²⁺-exchanger (NCX1) and PMCA1b (10). Active Pᵢ absorption occurs in the PT of the kidney via the

Na⁺-dependent Pi cotransporters, NaPi-IIa and NaPi-IIc. Both display high expression levels in the early segments (S1 and S2) of the PT (2, 11, 15–17). Figure 1 summarizes the transcellular pathways of Ca²⁺ (A) and Pi (B) transport in kidney and intestine.

**Hormonal regulation of transcellular Ca²⁺ (re)absorption**

Exquisite regulation of TRPV5 and TRPV6 activity is essential to whole body Ca²⁺ homeostasis. Here, we review the regulatory effects of the classically described hormones: PTH, 1,25(OH)₂D₃, and calcitonin on active Ca²⁺ transport processes. Later we will discuss the newly identified regulators of Ca²⁺ homeostasis: tissue kallikrein (TK), the antiaging hormone klotho, and estrogen. Central to this process is the Ca²⁺-sensing receptor (CaSR), which is expressed in the parathyroid gland where it senses blood Ca²⁺ levels (18, 19). In response to changes in blood Ca²⁺ concentrations, the CaSR regulates the release of PTH into the circulation (Figure 2). Specifically, hypocalcemia inhibits the CaSR that in turn promotes the secretion of PTH. This hormone stimulates Ca²⁺ mobilization from bone and the conversion of inactive vitamin D to 1,25(OH)₂D₃ by the renal cytochrome P450 enzyme 25-hydroxyvitamin D₃-1α-hydroxylase (1αOHase) (20). Increased 1,25(OH)₂D₃ levels activate vitamin D receptor (VDR)-mediated gene transcription, resulting in an increased transcription of Ca²⁺ transport proteins. Ultimately this results in the

Figure 1. Transcellular Ca²⁺ and Pi transport. Active Ca²⁺ and Pi transport across renal and intestinal epithelium. A: Ca²⁺ influx is mediated by TRPV5 in the renal distal convoluted and connecting tubules and TRPV6 in the duodenum. Subsequently, Ca²⁺ is transported across the cell to the basolateral membrane by Ca²⁺-binding proteins calbindin-D₂₈K (kidney) and calbindin-Dₙₖ (intestine). Extrusion into the blood takes place via the plasma membrane Ca²⁺-ATPase (PMCA1b) in the intestine and sodium-Ca²⁺ exchanger (NCX1) and PMCA1b in the kidney. B: The ileal brush border, sodium-dependent Pi cotransporter, NaPi-IIb, mediates entry of Pi into enterocytes. In the proximal tubules, NaPi-IIa and NaPi-IIc are responsible for Pi entry into the tubular epithelial cells. The transport mechanisms involved in basolateral extrusion of Pi into blood are unknown both in the intestine and kidney.

stimulation of Ca²⁺ (re)absorption (3, 21–24). Hypercalcemia has the opposite effect. This state activates the CaSR, thereby inhibiting PTH release and stimulating the secretion of calcitonin from the parafollicular cells of the thyroid. Calcitonin decreases osteoclast-mediated bone resorption and promotes lowering the blood Ca²⁺ concentration (25).

Estrogen contributes importantly to Ca²⁺ homeostasis by promoting bone mineralization and stimulating renal TRPV5 expression. This results in increased active Ca²⁺ reabsorption, independently of 1,25(OH)₂D₃ (26–28). PTH, 1,25(OH)₂D₃, and estrogen exert their effect on renal-mediated Ca²⁺ handling by altering, at the transcriptional level, the expression of Ca²⁺ transporters (7). This has been confirmed, *in vivo*, where a direct stimulatory effect of PTH on renal Ca²⁺ transporter expression levels was demonstrated in PTH-supplemented parathyroidectomized rats (29), and where the dietary supplementation of Ca²⁺ and the administration of estrogen to ovariectomized rats was shown to alter renal TRPV5 expression, all independently of 1,25(OH)₂D₃ (7, 23, 28).

The TK knockout (TK⁻/⁻) mouse displays significant renal Ca²⁺ wasting compared to control mice, implicating an important role for TK in the regulation of active Ca²⁺ reabsorption (30). In 2006, Gkika et al. described the molecular mechanism through which TK stimulates TRPV5-mediated active Ca²⁺ reabsorption. TK, a proteolytic enzyme that is secreted into the tubular fluid by renal epithelial cells, activates the bradykinin receptor stimulating the phospholipase C/1,2-diacylglycerol/protein kinase C (PLC/DAG/PKC) pathway. This results in increased plasma membrane expression of TRPV5, possibly due to an inhibition of TRPV5 endocytosis. Regardless of the exact mechanism, TK increases TRPV5-mediated Ca²⁺ transport (31).

Recently the antiaging hormone klotho has also been implicated in the regulation of the Ca²⁺ balance. Klotho knockout (klotho⁻/⁻) mice display hypercalcemia, hyperphosphaturia, hypercalciuria, and other manifestations resembling aging (32). Chang et al. demonstrated that klotho stimulates TRPV5-mediated Ca²⁺ transport *in vitro*, revealing a novel regulatory mechanism of active Ca²⁺ transport (33). Klotho is a type I transmembrane protein with β-glucuronidase activity. This activity is contained in the extracellular domain that can be secreted into the blood, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid (32, 34). Klotho hydrolyzes extracellular N-linked oligosaccharides present on TRPV5, entrapping the channel in the plasma membrane. This stimulatory effect of klotho on TRPV5 substantiates the important role of

Figure 2. Key players in Ca²⁺ and Pᵢ homeostasis. The concerted interplay of intestinal uptake, reabsorption in kidney, and bone (de)mineralization establishes the maintenance of a normal Ca²⁺ and Pᵢ balance. The calcium sensing receptor (CaSR), present in the thyroid gland, senses blood Ca²⁺ levels and triggers the secretion of the calcitropic hormones parathyroid hormone (PTH) and calcitonin. Ovarian-produced estrogen stimulates Ca²⁺ reabsorption also. Similar hormones are involved in the regulation of Pᵢ balance. Blood Pᵢ levels are controlled by PTH, 1,25(OH)₂D₃, klotho, and fibroblast growth factor member 23 (FGF23). A negative feedback mechanism prevents the accumulation of FGF23 and klotho since 1αOHase-mediated 1,25(OH)₂D₃ production is inhibited by FGF23 and klotho.

this antiaging hormone in Ca²⁺ homeostasis, specifically by altering the luminal membrane Ca²⁺ permeability of the DCT and the cortical collecting duct (CCD) (33). Alternatively, the mechanism of hypercalciuria observed in klotho⁻/⁻ mice has been suggested to be the result of decreased proximal Ca²⁺ absorption because of a decreased Na⁺K⁺-ATPase activity (35).

**Hormonal regulation of transcellular Pᵢ (re)absorption**

Our understanding of the hormonal control of Pᵢ balance is rapidly evolving. Klotho and FGF23 were recently identified as new key players involved in Pᵢ regulation, adding to what had already been delineated about the classical PTH/1,25(OH)₂D₃ regulatory pathway. PTH, 1,25(OH)₂D₃, and dietary Pᵢ intake are known to alter Pᵢ (re)absorption (36). An increased intestinal NaPi-IIb expression can be stimulated by either 1,25(OH)₂D₃ and/or low Pᵢ intake, ultimately resulting in elevated blood Pᵢ (6). Conversely, PTH decreases blood Pᵢ levels by inhibiting Pᵢ reabsorption from the PT. This occurs via an acute redistribution of NaPi-IIa proteins from the brush border to intracellular lysosomes, targeting them for degradation. The overall effect of PTH is therefore to lower blood Pᵢ levels by stimulating Pᵢ excretion (37).

Recently, FGF23 has been labeled a phosphatonin, due to its role in Pᵢ homeostasis (5, 38–40). Injection of FGF23 into mice results in hypophosphatemia by stimulating renal Pᵢ excretion. This is achieved by decreasing the expression of renal NaPi-IIa and NaPi-IIc and inhibiting 1αOHase production. The role of FGF23 in human Ca²⁺ and Pᵢ

homeostasis has been firmly established by genetic
linkage analysis. Inactivating mutations in FGF 23
have been identified in patients with tumoral
calcinosis causing hyperphosphatemia, and activating
mutations have been shown to cause autosomal
dominant hypophosphatemic rickets (ADHR) (41–
44). FGF 23 is a secreted, transmembrane protein
produced in bone osteoblasts (45, 46), which can
bind to and activate FGF receptors (FGFRs)
(47, 48). Further, the involvement of klotho in
FGF 23 signaling was suggested as klotho⁻/⁻ mice
and FGF 23 knockout (FGF 23⁻/⁻) mice exhibit
many common phenotypic features including hyper-
phosphatemia (32, 38, 49). This was confirmed in
2006, when Kurosu et al. demonstrated that klotho
forms a complex with FGFRs. This new complex
binds FGF 23 with a higher affinity than either the
FGFR or klotho alone (50). Two separate groups
extended this observation by showing that direct
binding of klotho to the FGFR1(IIIc) subtype
converts this receptor into a specific FGF 23 receptor
(48, 51). In addition, Ogawa et al. demonstrated that
another member of the klotho family, β-klotho, can
function as a cofactor in FGF 21 signaling, through a
similar interaction as with klotho and FGF 23 (52).
FGF 21 is expressed predominantly in the liver and is
a metabolic regulator of glucose uptake in adipo-
cytes, consequently it provides a potential therapeu-
tic target in diabetes mellitus (53). Other FGF
family members have been implicated in varying
signal transduction pathways throughout the
body (54). A recent report revealed that FGF 7 is
overexpressed in tumors associated with renal Pi
wasting and osteomalacia (55). FGF 7 inhibits Pi
transport in renal epithelial cells, although the exact
molecular mechanisms involved still need to be
elucidated. Further investigation is necessary to
determine whether other FGF superfamily members
are involved in the regulation of Ca²⁺ and Pi
homeostasis.

Hypercalcemia and hypocalcemia

Disturbances in both serum and whole body Ca²⁺
levels can cause severe pathological conditions, the
etiology of which is both complex and variable.
Hypercalcemia can result from Ca²⁺ hyperabsorp-
tion from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, decreased
urinary excretion, or an increased resorption from
bone. Elevated serum PTH levels, secondary to
hyperparathyroidism or a hypophosphatemic state,
will cause increased Ca²⁺ absorption from the GI
tract. Increased Ca²⁺ loss from bone is caused by
elevated PTH and/or 1,25(OH)₂D₃ levels or skeletal
metastasis, while severe dehydration will increase

serum Ca²⁺ concentration without altering the total
amount in blood. Symptoms and findings of
hypercalcemia include fatigue, electrocardiogram
abnormalities, nausea, vomiting, constipation, anor-
exia, abdominal pain, hypercalciuria, and conse-
quently kidney stone formation. Treatment of
hypercalcemia depends on the severity of the
abnormality and ranges from dietary adaptation to
the administration of calcimimetic compounds that
activate the CaSR in the parathyroid glands, redu-
cing blood PTH levels (56). Hypocalcemia can
result in muscle cramping, depression, psychosis,
and seizures. Causes include decreased Ca²⁺ absorp-
tion due to a poor intake, 1,25(OH)₂D₃ deficiency
or resistance, lack of sunlight, decreased bone
resorption, a complication of thyroid surgery (i.e.
parathyroidectomy), or renal Ca²⁺ wasting. Oral
Ca²⁺ and 1,25(OH)₂D₃ supplementation and ultra-
violet light exposure are the current treatments for
hypocalcemia.

Hypercalciuria

Hypercalciuria is a risk factor for renal Ca²⁺ stone
formation and therefore contributes to this signifi-
cant health and socioeconomic problem (57, 58). In
the United States (US) more than 5% of the
population will develop a clinically significant
episode of kidney stone disease in their lifetime of
which the economic impact is approximately $2
billion annually (59, 60). Hypercalciuria has been
classified into at least three different forms.
Absorption hypercalciuria is due to Ca²⁺ hyperab-
sorption from the GI tract, renal hypercalciuria is the
result of a defect in renal Ca²⁺ reabsorption, whereas
resorptive hypercalciuria manifests urinary Ca²⁺
wasting secondary to increased bone degradation.
Other than these three types of hypercalciuria, the
largest group of patients with this disorder lack an
explanation for their increased Ca²⁺ excretion and
have been classified as having idiopathic hypercal-
ciuria. Individuals with a family history of nephro-
lithiasis are themselves prone to develop kidney
stones. This strongly suggests that genetic factors are
involved in the pathogenesis of idiopathic hypercal-
ciuria (61). There is a myriad of potential dis-
turbances in Ca²⁺ homeostasis that can cause
hypercalciuria. Thus, hypercalciuria may be mono-
genic, polygenic, or multifactorial in its etiology. As
TRPV5 as well as TRPV6 gene ablation in mice
leads to severe forms of hypercalciuria, these
channels were proposed as candidate genes for
hypercalciuria (1, 62). To date, mutation analyses
of the TRPV5-encoding gene has not revealed a
primary role for TRPV5 in autosomal dominant

idiopathic hypercalciuria (63). However, the involvement of TRPV5 or TRPV6 in hypercalciuria has not been definitively excluded. Specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) or combinations of SNPs in TRPV5/TRPV6 may modulate channel activity, and might therefore be responsible for altered renal Ca²⁺ excretion (64). Further investigation is necessary to identify mutations in TRPV5 and TRPV6 associated with disease.

### Hyperphosphatemia and hypophosphatemia

Autosomal dominant hypophosphatemic rickets (ADHR) is a hereditary disorder characterized by bone malformation and renal Pi wasting. Activating mutations in the FGF23 gene have been identified in these patients (41, 65). Related diseases include X-linked hypophosphatemia (XLH) and hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets with hypercalciuria (HHRH); both are characterized by disturbances in Pi homeostasis. Tumor-induced osteomalacia (TIO) is characterized by hypophosphatemia secondary to renal Pi wasting and reduced blood 1,25(OH)₂D₃ levels (66, 67). Whilst the molecular identity of all the molecules responsible for these clinical disorders have yet to be identified, in a few instances genes involved in the maintenance of Pi homeostasis have been implicated other than FGF23 (68, 69). Hypophosphatemia causes decreased bone mineralization and subsequently bone fragility, pain, rickets, and growth retardation (69). Treatment is aimed at the replacement of Pi and/or 1,25(OH)₂D₃. Deactivating mutations in FGF23 cause hypophosphatemic tumoral calcinosis, characterized by hypervitaminosis D and increased intestinal and renal Pi absorption (43). Consistent with this, FGF23⁻/⁻ mice exhibit severe hyperphosphatemia further substantiating the regulatory role of FGF23 in Pi homeostasis (49). In humans, renal insufficiency, malignancy, drug abuse, or hypoparathyroidism can lead to hyperphosphatemia. Treatment is with Pi binders or directed at the primary cause.

### CRI

CRI is the progressive loss of renal function evinced by a decreasing glomerular filtration rate. Clinical symptoms and findings include hypertension, edema, hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia secondary to a decreased serum 1,25(OH)₂D₃ level, secondary hyperparathyroidism, and hyperphosphatemia. Disorders with disturbances in both Ca²⁺ and Pi homeostasis, of which CRI is just one, can lead to severe bone, cardiovascular, and other systemic diseases. CRI patients ultimately develop end-stage renal disease and require renal replacement therapy, i.e., dialysis or kidney transplantation. In order to minimize the burden of this disease it is imperative to attempt normalization of the Ca²⁺ and Pi balance in these patients (70).

Elevated blood FGF23 levels are detectable in CRI patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism. This is thought to represent a compensatory mechanism in an attempt to excrete excess Pi and thus lower blood Pi levels. The klotho⁻/⁻ mice exhibit increased blood FGF23 levels as well, possibly due to their apparent hyperphosphatemia (71, 72). As klotho has been implicated in the stimulation of TRPV5-mediated Ca²⁺ reabsorption and in the regulation of FGF23-mediated Pi reabsorption, both klotho and FGF23 may play significant roles in the pathogenesis, treatment options and prediction of the prognosis of CRI (73–75).

#### Lessons from TRPV5 and TRPV6 knockout mice

The generation and characterization of TRPV5 knockout (TRPV5⁻/⁻) mice confirmed this epithelial Ca²⁺ channel to be the gatekeeper of active Ca²⁺ reabsorption (1). TRPV5⁻/⁻ mice display severe hypercalciuria compared to control (TRPV5⁺/⁺) mice that are normocalcemic. The knockout mice display hypervitaminosis D and upregulation of intestinal TRPV6 and calbindin-D₂₈K, as a compensatory mechanism for their severe renal Ca²⁺ wasting. Cross-breeding of TRPV5⁻/⁻ and 1αOHase knockout (1αOHase⁻/⁻) mice was performed in order to address the role of the increased blood 1,25(OH)₂D₃ levels in these animals. TRPV5/1αOHase double knockout mice have decreased intestinal TRPV6 and calbindin-D₂₈K expression, hypocalcemia, and severe bone abnormalities compared to TRPV5⁻/⁻ mice. These findings support the notion that the hypervitaminosis D observed in TRPV5⁻/⁻ mice is responsible for the upregulation of intestinal Ca²⁺ transport proteins, and the consequent intestinal Ca²⁺ hyperabsorption, likely as compensation for the renal Ca²⁺ leak (76). Notably, TRPV5⁻/⁻ mice have acidic urine and are polyuric relative to their control littermates (1). Both of these symptoms would act to promote the excretion of large amounts of Ca²⁺ without it being precipitated in the collecting ducts. TRPV5⁻/⁻ mice display significant hyperphosphaturia, predisposing them to an increased risk of Ca²⁺ phosphate precipitation. The molecular mechanism responsible for the renal Pi leak in TRPV5⁻/⁻ mice remains unknown.
The TRPV5$^{-/-}$ mice show a greatly diminished expression of calbindin-D$_{28K}$. To assess whether the absence of TRPV5 or the downregulation of calbindin-D$_{28K}$ was responsible for the phenotype observed in the TRPV5$^{-/-}$ animals, double knockout mice, for both TRPV5 and calbindin-D$_{28K}$, were generated. These mice do not display a further increase in their Ca$^{2+}$ loss relative to TRPV5$^{-/-}$ mice, confirming that TRPV5 and not calbindin-D$_{28K}$ is the rate-limiting transporter in active Ca$^{2+}$ reabsorption (77).

In vivo studies of specific knockout mice models significantly contribute to our knowledge of renal and intestinal Ca$^{2+}$ handling. Recently, Bianco et al. generated the TRPV6 knockout (TRPV6$^{-/-}$) mouse in order to assess the role of this channel in intestinal Ca$^{2+}$ absorption in vivo and its involvement in other organ systems (62). Surprisingly, these mice display skin abnormalities due to a decreased Ca$^{2+}$ content in their epidermis and have impaired fertility. Consistent with known TRPV6 localization, the knockout animals exhibit defective intestinal Ca$^{2+}$ absorption as well as significant hypercalciuria and decreased bone mineralization compared to control littermates (62). Further, TRPV6$^{-/-}$ mice have secondary hyperparathyroidism and hypervitaminosis D such that they are normocalcemic. These findings indicate that TRPV6 is central to 1,25(OH)$_2$D$_3$-regulated Ca$^{2+}$ absorption and overall Ca$^{2+}$ homeostasis. Finally, the exhibition of abnormalities in multiple organs in TRPV6$^{-/-}$ mice underlines the importance of this channel in other body tissues. While TRPV5 clearly functions as a gatekeeper of active Ca$^{2+}$ reabsorption from the lumen of DCT and CNT, these recent findings suggest that TRPV6 may be an important regulator of Ca$^{2+}$ transport during embryonic and placental development. Maintenance of normal Ca$^{2+}$ levels is crucial for physiological functioning of the uterus and placenta, including both smooth muscle contraction and embryo implantation. Recently, Lee et al. demonstrated that estrogen regulates TRPV6 expression levels during pregnancy, which is important for normal uterine function (78). Studies of TRPV6$^{-/-}$ mice during embryogenesis and development will be important to elucidate the exact role of TRPV6 and of its contribution to Ca$^{2+}$ homeostasis during different stages of organogenesis, especially in the intestine and kidney.

role for this hormone in P$_i$ homeostasis (38, 49). The FGF23$^{-/-}$ mice display hyperphosphatemia, hypervitaminosis D, growth retardation and limb deformation. Crossing the FGF23$^{-/-}$ mice with 1$\alpha$OHase-deficient animals rescued much of this phenotype (79). Specifically the atherosclerosis and ectopic skeletal and soft tissue calcifications observed in the FGF23$^{-/-}$ animals are absent from the FGF23/1$\alpha$OHase double knockout mice. The double knockout animals also have increased survival. Of note the phenotype is not rescued completely, the FGF23/1$\alpha$OHase double knockout mice have a further reduction in bone mineral density in comparison to the FGF23$^{-/-}$ mice. Together these findings strongly suggest that the aging-like features, disturbed electrolyte levels, and impaired skeletogenesis in FGF23$^{-/-}$ mice are the result of increased blood 1,25(OH)$_2$D$_3$ levels (79, 80). To further elucidate the role of 1,25(OH)$_2$D$_3$ action in FGF23$^{-/-}$ mice, Hesse and co-workers cross-bred FGF23$^{-/-}$ mice with VDR knockout (VDR$^{-/-}$) mice (81). FGF23/VDR double knockout mice display a similar phenotype to the VDR$^{-/-}$ mice, suggesting that the aging-like symptoms in FGF23$^{-/-}$ mice depend upon intact signaling through the VDR (82). It is known that FGF23 expression is itself regulated by dietary P$_i$ and 1,25(OH)$_2$D$_3$, suggesting a regulatory feedback mechanism in which 1,25(OH)$_2$D$_3$ stimulates FGF23 production, that in turn inhibits 1$\alpha$OHase, thereby decreasing circulating 1,25(OH)$_2$D$_3$ levels (83, 84).

Klotho$^{-/-}$ mice display a phenotype similar to FGF23$^{-/-}$ mice, which includes hyperphosphatemia, hypervitaminosis D and bone abnormalities (32). The fact that the interplay of klotho and FGFRs is essential for FGF23 functioning and the finding that both klotho$^{-/-}$ and FGF23$^{-/-}$ mouse strains display comparable symptoms indicates that this newly identified klotho/FGF23 regulatory pathway is essential to P$_i$ homeostasis (48, 50). Klotho$^{-/-}$ mice also demonstrate other phenotypic features not described in FGF23$^{-/-}$ mice, including pulmonary, neuronal, and skin disorders, implying that klotho may interact with other FGFRs throughout the body (32, 50). How klotho causes these additional phenotypic features and whether other FGF family members mediate them requires further investigation.

## Outlook

The work described in this review has greatly increased our knowledge of Ca$^{2+}$ and P$_i$ homeostasis; however, several questions remain. Identification of the antiaging hormone klotho as a modulator of TRPV5 activity and its interaction with

## Insights into P$_i$ and Ca$^{2+}$ homeostasis from FGF23 and klotho knockout mice

The recent generation of FGF23$^{-/-}$ mice, by two independent research groups, confirmed a centralFGFRs permitting increased FGF23 signaling have been major breakthroughs in the understanding of both Ca²⁺ and Pi handling. An important tool in the elucidation of these research questions has been the use of knockout animal models. In this regard, it remains a challenge to determine the exact role of 1,25(OH)₂D₃ in both klotho- and FGF23-mediated signaling. It will be through further investigation of these newly identified regulatory pathways, including klotho, FGF23, and 1,25(OH)₂D₃, that a clearer understanding of how the body controls Ca²⁺ and Pi balance will be achieved. This knowledge will be crucial for the manipulation of either klotho or FGF23 to a therapeutic endpoint.
