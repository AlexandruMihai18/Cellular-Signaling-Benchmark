exclusive ligand specificity exists [10]. Many 14-3-3 binding proteins contain sequences that closely match the phosphorylated consensus motifs, although a small number of proteins are bound to 14-3-3 proteins through atypical sequences, which are phosphorylated, or sometimes do not require phosphorylation at all. In these cases, the binding is also mediated by the conserved amphipathic c

sumably other kinases, which are activated by DNA-damage, through subsequent binding to 14-3-3 proteins and cytoplasmic sequestration. This leads to increased CDC2 phosphorylation resulting in lower activity and inhibition of mitotic entry [44]. Also, during unperturbed S-phase progression, CDC25C proteins are kept inactive by cytoplasmic sequestration mediated by
DNA-damage
