## ABSTRACT

The renal connecting tubule (CNT) localizes to the distal part of the nephron between the distal convoluted tubule and the collecting duct, and consists of two different cell types: segment-specific and intercalated cells. The former reabsorb water (H₂O), sodium (Na⁺) and calcium (Ca²⁺) ions to the blood compartment, while secreting potassium ions (K⁺) into the pro-urine. The latter cells contribute to the renal control of the acid-base balance. Several factors and hormones tightly regulate these transport processes. Although the CNT reabsorbs only ~15% of filtered Ca²⁺ load, this segment is finally decisive for the amount of Ca²⁺ that appears in the urine. Impaired Ca²⁺ transport across CNT can provoke severe urinary Ca²⁺ excretion, called hypercalciuria. This review mainly focuses on the activity, abundance and expression of the epithelial Ca²⁺ channel named Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid 5 (TRPV5) that is the gatekeeper of active Ca²⁺ reabsorption in the CNT.

## 1. Introduction

The kidneys control the maintenance of body ion balance and arterial blood pressure. Blood is filtrated by the glomeruli and the electrolytes are reabsorbed from the pro-urine along the various segments constituting the nephron. The distal part of the nephron that comprises the distal convoluted tubule (DCT), the connecting duct (CNT) and the collecting duct (CD) achieves the final adjustment of renal ion excretion which is regulated by various hormones. The CNT displays different morphologic characteristics. While the CNT is short and directly linked to the CD in the superficial cortex, it is longer and merges with other CNT segments in the juxtamedullary region to form the “arcades” before flowing into the cortical collecting duct (Fig. 1A). The epithelium of CNT is composed of two different cell types: intercalated and non-intercalated cells that are intermingled with one another at a ratio of approximately 1:2. The nomenclature of these cells is not yet unambiguously defined. The non-intercalated cells have been named CNT cells (Seldin and Giebisch, 1992). However, the term “CNT cells” is confusing since intercalated cells are also CNT cells, i.e. cells originating from the CNT. Alternatively, authors (Verrey, 2001; Ronzaud et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2010) proposed the term “principal cells” to characterize the non-intercalated cells of the aldosterone-sensitive distal part of the nephron, composed of DCT, CNT and CD. However, in a strict sense, the term “principal cells” refers only to the non-intercalated cells of the CD (Seldin and Giebisch, 1992). Thus, in this review, we prefer to use the term “segment-specific cells” to describe the non-intercalated cells of the CNT (Loffing and Korbmacher, 2009).

Segment-specific cells of the CNT, which have a polygonal shape, express many transporters involved in transcellular ion transport. They actively transport H₂O, Na⁺, K⁺ and Ca²⁺ (Fig. 1B). Intercalated cells that have a rounded shape regulate the urinary acidification. Both cell types contain a high density of mitochondria (Fig. 1C and D).

## 2. CNT origin

The embryological origin of CNT is not entirely clear. It has been proposed that it originates from the nephrogenic blastema (Neiss and Klehn, 1981) or from the branching ureteric bud (Howie et al., 1993). However, others suggest that the CNT develops by mutual induction processes initiated from adjoining segments. This last

Fig. 1. The morphologic characteristics and cell types of the CNT. (A) The CNT (*in blue*) is located to the distal part of the nephron and consists of segment-specific and intercalated cells. While the CNT is short in the superficial cortex, it is longer in the juxtamedullary region. (B) Segment-specific cells of CNT are characterized by different transporters: (1) in the apical side: TRPV5 mediates the influx of Ca²⁺, ENaC mediates the influx of Na⁺, ROMK1 mediates the efflux of K⁺, AQP2 permits H₂O transport inside cell; (2) in the basolateral side; Ca²⁺ is extruded by the concerted action of the PMCA1b pump and the NCX1 exchanger, Na⁺ is extruded by the Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase which also permits the entry of K⁺, H₂O is extruded in the blood compartment by the AQP3 or AQP4. (C) Intercalated type A cells apically secrete H⁺ in the pro-urine compartment by a H⁺-ATPase and basolaterally extrudes HCO₃⁻ in the blood compartment by an Cl⁻/HCO₃⁻ exchanger (AE1). (D) Intercalated type B cells apically secretes HCO₃⁻ in the pro-urine compartment by an Cl⁻/HCO₃⁻ exchanger (AE4) and basolaterally extrudes H⁺ in the blood compartment by a H⁺-ATPase.

hypothesis is consistent with the fact that the CNT shares characteristics of both the DCT and CD. Like the DCT, the CNT expresses TRPV5 and like the CD, the CNT has numerous intercalated cells (Schmitt et al., 1999).

## 3. Function

### 3.1. Segment-specific cells of CNT

#### 3.1.1. H₂O transport
Vasopressin increases the H₂O reabsorption in the CNT by binding to the basolateral V₂ receptor that stimulates a cyclic adenosine monophosphate and protein kinase A (cAMP-PKA)-dependent signaling pathway. This ultimately leads to the apical translocation and activation of the water channel aquaporin 2 (AQP2). H₂O is finally transported at the basolateral side by aquaporin 3 (AQP3) and 4 (AQP4) channels (Coleman et al., 2000).

#### 3.1.2. Na⁺ transport
Active Na⁺ transport in the CNT is a two-step process that involves Na⁺ uptake by the apical ENaC and Na⁺ extrusion by the basolateral Na⁺ pump Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase. It is stimulated by several hormones including vasopressin (Bugaj et al., 2009), insulin (Markadieu et al., 2009) and aldosterone (Verrey et al., 2008). Aldosterone binds to the mineralocorticoid receptor and increases activity and expression of Na⁺ transporters and thus stimulates the transepithelial Na⁺ reabsorption. The existence of genetic disorders associated with a loss-of-function or hyperactivity of ENaC, leading to renal salt wasting syndromes and arterial hypertension, respectively, emphasizes that ENaC is the rate-limiting step of active Na⁺ transport (Loffing and Korbmacher, 2009).

#### 3.1.3. K⁺ transport
Segment-specific cells are also involved in the regulation of K⁺ secretion. K⁺ entry into the CNT cell is facilitated by

Fig. 2. Ca²⁺ transport across segment-specific cells of CNT. TRPV5 mediates the apical entry of Ca²⁺ inside the cell. In the urinary compartment, acidic conditions (H⁺) decrease the activity of TRPV5. Klotho directly interacts with TRPV5 and tissue kallikrein binds to the bradykinin receptor (BKR) located to the apical membrane. Both klotho and tissue kallikrein (TK) increase the apical abundance of TRPV5. Intracellularly, Ca²⁺ is buffered by calbindin-D₂₈ₖ and is shuttled to the basolateral membrane that contains the NCX1 exchanger and the PMCA1b pump. Free cytosolic Ca²⁺ decreases the open probability of TRPV5 while 80K-H increases its activity. Rab11a and the annexin-2-S100A complex increase the apical insertion of TRPV5 while caveolin decrease its plasma membrane abundance. In the blood compartment, PTH, 1,25(OH)₂D₃ and estrogen increase the transcription and protein expression of TRPV5 while androgen inhibits its level of expression.

the Na⁺-K⁺/ATPase located in the basolateral membrane. Subsequently, accumulated K⁺ ions are released in the pro-urine via the renal outer medulla potassium channel ROMK1. The main factors regulating K⁺ secretion are the dietary K⁺ intake and aldosterone (Frindt et al., 2009).

#### 3.1.4. Ca²⁺ transport
Ca²⁺ plays a fundamental role in many cellular processes and its extracellular concentration is controlled by the kidney, intestine and bone in a concerted fashion. In kidney, the late part of DCT and the CNT are the site of active Ca²⁺ transport and precisely regulate Ca²⁺ reabsorption. Although these distal segment reabsorb only ~15% of the Ca²⁺ filtered, they are responsible for the final adjustment of urinary Ca²⁺ excretion and are tightly regulated by several hormones. Ca²⁺ enters the CNT cell through TRPV5 (Hoenderop et al., 1999) and is extruded into the blood compartment by the concerted action of the plasma membrane Ca²⁺ pump (PMCA1b) and the Na⁺/Ca²⁺ exchanger (NCX1). TRPV5 knockout (TRPV5⁻/⁻) mice exhibit severe urinary Ca²⁺ wasting, providing evidence for a gatekeeper role of TRPV5 in active renal Ca²⁺ transport (Hoenderop et al., 2003). In vivo micropuncture experiments confirmed that Ca²⁺ reabsorption is indeed impaired in the CNT. Moreover, TRPV5⁻/⁻ mice displayed phosphaturia, compensatory intestinal Ca²⁺ hyperabsorption, reduced bone thickness, polyuria and urinary acidification (Hoenderop et al., 2003). Intracellular Ca²⁺ concentration is kept low with respect to the extracellular fluid. Calbindin-D₂₈ₖ, a Ca²⁺-binding protein, appears to shuttle Ca²⁺ from the TRPV5 channel to the basolateral Ca²⁺ transporters. Simultaneously, calbindin-D₂₈ₖ buffers Ca²⁺ during high Ca²⁺ influx providing protection against toxic high cytosolic Ca²⁺ concentrations (Lambers et al., 2006).

The mechanisms by which TRPV5 is regulated can be classified in the following categories: (i) increase in TRPV5 protein expression; (ii) plasma membrane insertion of TRPV5; (iii) direct TRPV5 channel activation; and (iv) plasma membrane TRPV5 retrieval (Fig. 2 and Table 1). Calcitropic hormones, such as vitamin D₃ and parathyroid hormone (PTH), increase the protein expression of TRPV5 (Boros et al., 2009). The active form of vitamin D₃, 1,25-

TRPV5 is mainly regulated by four different mechanisms: protein expression, plasma membrane insertion, channel activation and plasma membrane retrieval.

dihydroxyvitamin D₃ (1,25(OH)₂D₃), regulates the transcription of the Ca²⁺ channel. Mice deficient for 1,25(OH)₂D₃ show severe hypocalcemia induced by reduced mRNA and protein levels of TRPV5. Here, protein expression can be normalized by administration of 1,25(OH)₂D₃ (Hoenderop et al., 2002). PTH, released by the parathyroid gland when blood Ca²⁺ concentration is low, activates its receptor located to the basal membrane of CNT and increases the expression of TRPV5. Again, parathyroidectomized mice display reduced TRPV5 abundance leading to hypocalcemia. Protein expression is restored by parathyroid supplementation (van Abel et al., 2005). Moreover, PTH can activate TRPV5 via a cAMP-PKA signaling pathway that rapidly phosphorylates TRPV5 leading to an increase in channel opening probability (de Groot et al., 2009). The male and female sex hormones, estrogens and androgens, play also a role in renal Ca²⁺ handling. Male mice have a higher urinary Ca²⁺ excretion than female mice. In orchidectomized mice, androgen deficiency increases the expression level of both TRPV5 and calbindin-D₂₈ₖ, which in turn is suppressed by testosterone treatment (Hsu et al., 2010). Active renal Ca²⁺ reabsorption is also regulated by intracellular trafficking of TRPV5. Annexin-2 facilitates the apical insertion of TRPV5 through formation of a complex with S100A10 and the Ca²⁺ channel (van de Graaf et al., 2003). TRPV5 is recycled from the endosomes by the small GTPase Rab11a (van de Graaf et al., 2006) and PKC inhibitors prevent the caveolin-mediated internalization of TRPV5 (Cha et al., 2008a). Moreover, extracellular pH can affect TRPV5 apical abundance. While alkaline medium provokes apical membrane recruitment of Ca²⁺ channel vesicles, acidic medium induces internalization of TRPV5 (Lambers et al., 2007). Maintaining a constant intracellular Ca²⁺ concentration is essential. Therefore, a negative feedback mechanism, including a decrease in the activity of TRPV5, is activated when the intracellular Ca²⁺ concentration exceeds the physiological range (Nilius et al., 2001). The PKC substrate 80K-H colocalizes with TRPV5 and controls the channel activity in a Ca²⁺-dependent manner (Gkika et al., 2004). Finally, several pro-urinary factors stabilize TRPV5 in the apical membrane. Tissue kallikrein (TK) is a serine protease expressed in the CNT and secreted into the pro-urine. TK binds to the bradykinin receptor located to the apical membrane and increases the plasma membrane abundance of TRPV5. Activation of the bradykinin receptor leads to stimulation of PKC that subsequently phosphorylates the channel and inhibits its apical membrane retrieval (Gkika et al., 2006). Klotho present in the pro-urine and in the blood flow enhances Ca²⁺ reabsorption. Klotho gene is an aging suppressor gene in mice that accelerates aging when disrupted and extends life span when overexpressed (Kuro-o, 2009). The extracellular domain of klotho is secreted into blood and urine by ectodomain shedding (Kuro-o, 2009). At the apical membrane, klotho hydrolyzes the extracellular sugar residues of TRPV5, resulting in inhibition of its plasma membrane retrieval (Alexander et al., 2009). At the basolateral membrane, it has been reported that klotho can interact and subsequently increase the activity of Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase (Imura et al., 2007). The exact molecular target of klotho on the N-glycan tree of TRPV5 remains to be determined. Klotho can cleave TRPV5 by its β-glucuronidase activity (Chang et al., 2005) or by its sialidase activity (Cha et al., 2008b). Interestingly, the fact that klotho stimulates both apical and basolateral transporters, suggests that it could have a more major role in active Ca²⁺ transport in the CNT.

Future experiments should address the molecular structure of TRPV5. The determination of its crystallographic structure would clarify other signaling pathways or channel conformational changes. In this regard, the molecular mechanism responsible for TRPV5 inactivation by intracellular Ca²⁺ remains to be elucidated and potent PKA- or PKC-dependent phosphorylation sites on TRPV5 need to be highlighted. The molecular mechanism by which intracellular Ca²⁺ is transported from the apical to the basolateral side is also largely unknown. It has been suggested that calbindin-D₂₈ₖ buffers Ca²⁺ entering at the apical membrane and subsequently delivers it to the basolateral membrane. Nevertheless, the existence of a crosstalk between the apical Ca²⁺ entry and the basolateral Ca²⁺ extrusion system is not clear. The main unresolved question is how the apical and basolateral Ca²⁺ transporters communicate with each other to optimize the fine-tuning of Ca²⁺ reabsorption.

### 3.2. Intercalated cells

Intercalated cells are mainly classified into two subtypes: type A cells which apically secrete H⁺ through the vacuolar pump H⁺-ATPase and release bicarbonate into the blood compartment by a Cl⁻/HCO₃⁻ exchanger and type B cells which secrete bicarbonate and basolaterally extrude H⁺ (Wagner et al., 2009) (Fig. 1C and D).

The activity of intercalated cells has an indirect impact on Ca²⁺ reabsorption. Metabolic acidosis, secondary to renal tubular acidosis, is caused by the inability of the intercalated cells to effectively lower the intraluminal pH in the CNT and CD. Then, during metabolic acidosis, the urinary pH becomes acidic to compensate for the decreased systemic pH. It has been previously demonstrated that there is a relationship between the pH and TRPV5 activity (Lambers et al., 2007). An acidic intraluminal pH decreases the activity of TRPV5, while an alkali intraluminal pH activates the channel (Lambers et al., 2007). Thus, during conditions of metabolic acidosis, these TRPV5-specific effects probably contribute to the observed Ca²⁺ wasting.

### 4. Associated pathologies

Hyperphosphaturia and hypercalciuria observed in the TRPV5⁻/⁻ mice could promote the formation of renal stones. However, these mice lack renal Ca²⁺-phosphate stones due to an adaptive mechanism in the CD. During a hypercalciuric state, the Ca²⁺-sensitive receptor CaSR that is apically expressed in both principal and intercalated cells of the CD, is activated (Renkema et al., 2009). CaSR activation stimulates urinary H⁺ excretion by activation of the vacuolar pump H⁺-ATPase leading to an acidic urine and decreases the apical expression of AQP2 channels leading to polyuria. Urinary acidification and polyuria prevent the precipitation of Ca²⁺-phosphate (Renkema et al., 2009).

Pathologies associated with a dysfunction of the CNT can also be related to a decreased reabsorption of water (nephrogenic diabetes insipidus), an increased H⁺ secretion (renal tubular acidosis) or a dysregulation of Na⁺ reabsorption (pseudo-hypoaldosteronism or pseudo-aldosteronism).

Impairment of AQP2-mediated H₂O transport due to a loss-of-function mutation of V₂ receptor is associated with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus ([Loonen et al., 2008](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.semnephrol.2008.03.005)).

Inability of type A intercalated cells to secrete H⁺ generates a distal renal acidosis that is characterized by metabolic acidosis. Distal renal acidosis defines inherited disorders caused by autosomal dominant mutation of the Cl⁻/HCO₃⁻ exchanger or by autosomal recessive mutation of the vacuolar pump H⁺-ATPase. Renal acidosis induces hypercalciuria by inhibition of TRPV5 activity and can provoke the appearance of kidney stones ([Lambers et al., 2007](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2007.04.019)).

Dysregulation of Na⁺ reabsorption by mutations of ENaC induces two syndromes: pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1 or pseudoaldosteronism (Liddle's syndrome). Pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1 is due to a loss-of-function mutation of ENaC that generates renal salt wasting, while Liddle's syndrome is characterized by a gain-of-function mutation of ENaC that produces arterial hypertension ([Schild, 1996](https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00367446)).

Pseudohypoaldosteronism type 2 (Gordon's syndrome) is a disorder associated with hypertension and hypercalciuria ([Stratton et al., 1998](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0007-1237(98)00014-2)). A loss-of-mutation of With-no-lysine kinases, especially WNK4, could be responsible for this syndrome. Through Xenopus oocyte coexpression, TRPV5 has been shown to be directly activated by WNK4, suggesting that hypercalciuria could be due to inactivating mutations of WNK4 ([Jiang et al., 2007](https://doi.org/10.1152/ajprenal.00105.2007)). Recently, WNK4 knock-in mice featuring Gordon’s syndrome permitted to uncover new mechanisms of hypercalciuria. Decreased passive Ca²⁺ reabsorption in the upstream nephron with an adaptive increase in the TRPV6 channel (a homologue of TRPV5 present in the distal part of the nephron) and calbindin-D₂₈ₖ expression might be involved in the hypercalciuria of Gordon’s syndrome ([Yang et al., 2010](https://doi.org/10.1210/en.2010-0070)).
