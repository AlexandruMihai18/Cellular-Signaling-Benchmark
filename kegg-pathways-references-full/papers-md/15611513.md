### ABSTRACT

Germline inactivation of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene causes the von Hippel-Lindau hereditary cancer syndrome, and somatic mutations of this gene have been linked to the development of sporadic hemangioblastomas and clear-cell renal carcinomas. The VHL tumor suppressor protein (pVHL), through its oxygen-dependent polyubiquitylation of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF), plays a central role in the mammalian oxygen-sensing pathway. This interaction between pVHL and HIF is governed by post-translational prolyl hydroxylation of HIF in the presence of oxygen by a conserved family of Egl-nine (EGLN) enzymes. In the absence of pVHL, HIF becomes stabilized and is free to induce the expression of its target genes, many of which are important in regulating angiogenesis, cell growth, or cell survival. Moreover, preliminary data indicate that HIF plays a critical role in pVHL-defective tumor formation, raising the possibility that drugs directed against HIF or its downstream targets (such as vascular endothelial growth factor) might one day play a role in the treatment of hemangioblastoma and renal cell carcinoma. On the other hand, clear genotype-phenotype correlations are emerging in VHL disease and can be rationalized if pVHL has functions separate from its control of HIF.

### VON HIPPEL-LINDAU DISEASE

von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is a hereditary cancer syndrome characterized by CNS and retinal hemangioblastomas, clear-cell renal carcinomas, and pheochromocytomas. It was first described in the medical literature in 1894 by Treacher Collins, who detailed his histopathological observations on bilateral vascular growths in the retinas of two siblings. A decade later, Eugene von Hippel, a German ophthalmologist, described another family in which individuals developed similar blood vessel tumors of the retina and coined the term *angiomatosis retinae*. The Swedish pathologist Arvid Lindau, while writing a thesis on cystic lesions of the cerebellum, noted that these retinal lesions were associated with an increased risk of developing hemangioblastomas of the brain and spinal cord. Although previously referred to as “Lindau’s disease,” Charles Davison coined the eponym “von Hippel-Lindau disease” in 1936. Since then, a variety of other lesions have also been associated with VHL disease including visceral cysts, particularly of the pancreas and kidneys, and other tumors such as clear-cell renal carcinomas, pheochromocytomas, endolymphatic sac tumors of the inner ear, epididymal and broad ligament cystadenomas, and islet-cell tumors of the pancreas. VHL disease affects approximately 1 in 35,000 individuals and is transmitted in an autosomal dominant manner.

### ISOLATION OF THE VHL GENE

The VHL gene was mapped by linkage analysis to the short arm of chromosome 3 in 1988 by Seizinger et al. It was isolated in 1993 using a positional cloning strategy through an international collaboration led by Eamon Maher (University of Cambridge, England), Michael Lerman, Marston Linehan, and Berton Zbar (National Cancer Institute, United States). The VHL gene consists of three exons and is widely expressed in both fetal and adult tissues. In particular, expression of the VHL gene is not restricted to the organs affected in VHL disease.

Individuals with VHL disease carry one wild-type VHL allele and one inactivated VHL allele. In other words, VHL patients are VHL heterozygotes. Tumor or cyst development in VHL disease is linked to somatic inactivation or loss of the remaining wild-type VHL allele. In earlier studies, VHL mutations were not identifiable in up to 20% of patients who carried a clinical diagnosis of VHL disease. However, a more recent report indicates that VHL gene abnormalities can be detected in such patients if conventional methods, such as direct DNA sequencing and Southern Blot Analysis, are supplemented with quantitative Southern Blotting and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Approximately 20% to 37% of VHL patients have large or partial germline deletions, 30% to 38% have missense mutations, and 23% to 27% have nonsense or frameshift mutations. In general, VHL mutations are extremely heterogeneous and are distributed throughout the coding sequence, except that intragenic missense mutations are rarely seen within the first 50 codons. In total, more than 150 different germline VHL mutations linked to VHL disease have been reported. Listing of VHL mutations can be viewed at two Internet sites (http://www.umd.necker.fr:2005 and http://web.ncifcrf.gov).

### GENOTYPE-PHENOTYPE CORRELATIONS IN VHL DISEASE

Clear genotype-phenotype correlations are emerging in VHL disease and may be useful in counseling patients regarding the risk of developing specific VHL-associated tumors such as pheochromocytoma. Clinically, VHL families can be subdivided based on the presence (type 2) or absence (type 1) of pheochromocytomas (Table 1). Type 2 families can be further subclassified based on their risk of developing renal cell carcinoma: low risk (type 2A) or high risk (type 2B). Some type 2 families develop pheochromocytoma without the other classical stigmata of VHL disease (type 2C). Families at risk for developing pheochromocytoma (type 2 families) almost invariably harbor VHL missense mutations, in contrast to families without pheochromocytomas (type 1 families). Type 1 families frequently harbor VHL deletions or truncation mutations. It is presumed that the genotype-phenotype correlations in VHL disease reflect the degree to which the functions of the VHL gene product, pVHL, are quantitatively or qualitatively altered by different VHL mutations (discussed later).

### DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF HEREDITARY RENAL CELL CARCINOMA

VHL disease is one of several hereditary cancer syndromes associated with an increased risk of renal cell carcinoma (Table 2). These syndromes can usually be distinguished from VHL disease based on tumor histology and coexistent clinical features. Hereditary papillary renal carcinoma, which is distinct from the clear-cell variant associated with VHL disease, has been linked to germline gain of function mutations of the c-Met proto-oncogene or loss of function mutations of the Fumarate Hydratase gene. Fumarate Hydratase mutations are also associated with an increased risk of cutaneous leiomyomata and uterine fibroids. Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome, caused by germline loss of function mutations of the BHD gene, is characterized by fibrofolliculomas, lung cysts (with or without spontaneous pneumothorax), and a spectrum of renal carcinomas of varying histological subtypes (chromophobe, oncocytoma, clear-cell, or papillary). Bin Teh et al have also described a familial clear-cell renal carcinoma syndrome that is not linked to VHL mutation and whose cause is currently unknown.

### DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF HEREDITARY PHEOCHROMOCYTOMA

Familial pheochromocytoma (or paraganglioma) is a feature not only of VHL disease but also of neurofibromatosis

type 1, which is caused by loss of function mutation of the NF1 gene, and multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN 2), which is caused by gain of function mutation of the RET gene. Familial pheochromocytoma has also been linked to germline inactivating mutations affecting specific succinate dehydrogenase subunits (B, C, D; Table 3). Interestingly, approximately 25% of apparently sporadic pheochromocytomas are actually due to an occult germline mutation in either VHL, RET, or one of these succinate dehydrogenase genes. In contrast, germline VHL mutations are uncommon in patients who present with seemingly sporadic clear-cell renal carcinoma or hemangioblastoma (Table 4).

VHL MUTATIONS AND SPORADIC TUMORS

In keeping with the Knudson two-hit model, biallelic VHL inactivation (as a result of mutation or hypermethylation) is common in both sporadic hemangioblastomas and sporadic clear-cell renal carcinomas (Table 4). VHL seems to be mutated somatically in approximately 50%, and hypermethylated in another 10% to 20% of sporadic clear-cell renal carcinomas. However, mutation or hypermethylation of the VHL gene is rarely detected in other histologic subtypes of renal cell carcinoma. Similarly, VHL has been found to be mutated somatically in approximately 30% of sporadic hemangioblastomas. In contrast to renal cell

carcinoma, however, hypermethylation of VHL in sporadic hemangioblastomas has not been detected to date (Table 4).

In the setting of sporadic tumors, both the first “hit” and second “hit” occur somatically (that is, after conception) rather than in the germline. Germline VHL mutations are rarely discovered in patients who present with seemingly sporadic clear-cell renal carcinoma or hemangioblastoma, in contrast to patients who present with seemingly sporadic pheochromocytoma. Surprisingly, somatic VHL mutations are rare in truly sporadic pheochromocytoma (that is, in pheochromocytomas that are not linked to germline VHL mutations), despite the increased risk of this tumor in VHL disease (Table 4). Among several possibilities, this might suggest that the development of pheochromocytoma in the setting of VHL disease is due to inactivation of VHL during a critical developmental window or is linked to a “field defect” (that is, a defect shared by all the cells in a tissue rather than an individual clone) resulting from VHL haploinsufficiency. Studies examining a variety of other sporadic tumors, including breast, colon, lung, and prostate cancers, have found that somatic VHL mutations are rare in histological tumor types that are not observed in VHL disease. ${ }^{23,24,53,54}$

### PVLH

The VHL mRNA encodes a protein (pVHL) that contains 213 amino acid residues and migrates with an apparent molecular weight of ~24 to 30 kDa (VHL $_{30}$ ). ${ }^{9}$ The primary sequence of pVHL does not closely resemble that of other known proteins. A second pVHL isoform of approximately 19 kDa (VHL $_{19}$ ) is produced as a result of internal translational initiation at an in-frame start codon (ATG) at codon 54. ${ }^{55-57}$ Both isoforms appear to retain tumor suppressor activity, perhaps accounting for the paucity of VHL missense mutations affecting the first 50 amino acid residues (described earlier). For simplicity, the term “pVHL” is used when referring to both isoforms generically.

pVHL shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm. ${ }^{58-61}$ This shuttling by pVHL is important for its tumor suppressor function. There is some suggestion that VHL $_{30}$ resides primarily in the cytoplasm, while VHL $_{19}$ is located primarily in the nucleus, suggesting that the functions of the two isoforms, while overlapping, are not identical.

### PVHL REGULATES HYPOXIA-INDUCIBLE GENES

The tumors linked to VHL inactivation are often highly vascular and can overproduce angiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). ${ }^{63-69}$ In addition, renal cell carcinoma, hemangioblastomas, and pheochromocytomas have been associated with paraneoplastic erythrocytosis due to

erythropoietin (Epo) overproduction. ${ }^{70-73}$ VEGF and Epo mRNAs are prototypical hypoxia-inducible mRNAs (that is, these mRNAs are normally induced under conditions characterized by inadequate oxygenation). These considerations led to the discovery that cells lacking pVHL constitutively overproduce hypoxia-inducible mRNAs and that restoration of pVHL function results in down-regulation of hypoxia-inducible mRNAs in the presence of oxygen. ${ }^{66,74-77}$ Thus, overproduction of hypoxia-inducible mRNAs is a hallmark of pVHL-defective cells.

### THE PVHL UBIQUITIN LIGASE COMPLEX

Early biochemical studies revealed that pVHL forms a multiprotein complex that contained two proteins called Elongin B and Elongin C (Fig 1). ${ }^{78-80}$ Later, two additional components of the pVHL complex, called Cul2 ${ }^{81,82}$ and Rbx1 (also called ROC1 or Hrt1), ${ }^{83}$ were discovered. Elongin C and Cul2 were noted to be similar to individual components (Skp1 and Cdc53, respectively) of multiprotein complexes in yeast, called SCF complexes (Skp1, Cdc53, F-box protein). ${ }^{81,82,84}$ SCF complexes target specific proteins for degradation. In particular, SCF complexes orchestrate a post-translational modification, called polyubiquitylation (for this reason, these enzymes are often referred to as ubiquitin ligases), of their substrates. The presence of a polyubiquitin tail serves as a signal or “flag” for the substrate to be degraded by another multiprotein complex, called the proteasome. In such SCF complexes, the F-box protein serves as the substrate-binding module and thereby confers specificity on the SCF complex. ${ }^{85}$

The three-dimensional structure of pVHL bound to Elongin B and Elongin C confirmed that Elongin C, as suspected, resembled Skp1. Moreover, it revealed that the region of pVHL that binds directly to Elongin C loosely resembles an F-box. Therefore the hypothesis emerged that the pVHL complex, like SCF complexes in yeast, might be a ubiquitin ligase. ${ }^{86}$ In keeping with this idea, two groups soon showed that partially purified pVHL complexes, recovered by immunoprecipitation using monoclonal antibodies, contained a ubiquitin ligase activity. ${ }^{87,88}$

### PVHL POLYUBIQUITYLATES HIF

Many of the genes that are regulated by hypoxia, including the previously mentioned VEGF and Epo, are under the control of a transcription factor called hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF). HIF is made up of two nonidentical subunits (an alpha subunit and a beta subunit) and binds to specific DNA sequences, whereupon it can activate transcription.

Kim and Kaelin

![Diagram](#)

Fig 1. Regulation of hypoxia-inducible factor alpha (HIFα) by the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein (pVHL). Under low oxygen conditions (hypoxia), HIFα is stabilized and activates transcription in concert with the coactivator proteins p300 and cAMP-response element binding protein binding protein (CBP). Under normal oxygen conditions (normoxia), HIFα is hydroxylated on conserved prolyl residues within the oxygen-dependent degradation (ODD) domain by egl-nine (EGLN) family members and on a specific asparagine (N) residue by FIH-1 (factor inhibiting HIF1). The latter prevents coactivator recruitment, and the former creates a binding site for pVHL. The pVHL complex polyubiquitylates HIFα, which is then destroyed by the proteasome. NTAD, N-terminal transactivation domain; P, proline; OH, hydroxyl group; Ub, ubiquitin.

There are three HIFα genes in the human genome and three HIFβ genes (also called the aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocators [ARNT]).<sup>89</sup> For simplicity, the HIFα and HIFβ family members will be referred to generically as HIFα and HIFβ, respectively. HIFβ is a stable protein, while the HIFα proteins are highly unstable if oxygen is present. Hence, formation of an active HIF heterodimer is restricted to hypoxic conditions.

In 1999, Maxwell et al showed that cells lacking pVHL fail to degrade HIFα subunits in the presence of oxygen. Moreover, they found that pVHL and HIFα subunits can bind to one another.<sup>90</sup> Building on these observations, it was soon established that the pVHL complex was indeed a ubiquitin ligase and that it directed the polyubiquitylation, and hence destruction, of HIFα subunits in the presence of oxygen,<sup>91-94</sup> thus providing a mechanistic link between pVHL inactivation and overproduction of hypoxia-inducible mRNAs.

HYDROXYLATION OF HIF

The stabilization of HIFα that normally occurs under hypoxic conditions implied that the binding of pVHL to HIFα, or the functional consequences thereof, was oxygen dependent. Earlier studies had identified a subdomain of HIF1α, sometimes called the oxygen-dependent degradation domain (ODD), that was sufficient to confer instability in the presence of oxygen.<sup>95-97</sup> This region of HIF1α overlaps one of its two transactivation domains (called the NTAD and CTAD for N-terminal and C-terminal transactivation domain, respectively), which are the regions responsible for activating transcription once recruited to DNA (Fig 1). Three groups independently showed that HIF1α must undergo an oxygen-dependent posttranslational modification to be recognized by pVHL.<sup>98-100</sup> In particular, binding by pVHL is linked to hydroxylation of evolutionarily conserved proline residues (technically,

prolyl residues since the proline amino acids are incorporated into a protein) within the HIF1α ODD<sup>98-101</sup> (hydroxylation of equivalent prolyl residues takes place in HIF2α and HIF3α).<sup>102</sup> The three-dimensional crystal structure of HIF1α bound to pVHL reveals that the prolyl hydroxyl group forms critical hydrogen bonds with two hydrophilic residues within the otherwise hydrophobic pVHL substrate-binding domain.<sup>103,104</sup>

Studies in model organisms (*C. elegans* and *Drosophila*) led to the identification of the HIF prolyl hydroxylase gene, called *Egl-9* (so named because it was the ninth gene isolated in an earlier genetic screen for egg laying defective *C. elegans* mutants).<sup>105,106</sup> Mammalian cells contain three genes (*EGLN1*, *EGLN2*, and *EGLN3*) that are ancestrally related to *Egl-9*, and their protein products are all capable of hydroxylating HIFα subunits in vitro.<sup>105-108</sup> The degree to which these three proteins contribute either alone or in combination to HIF regulation in vivo is currently under investigation.

Activation of gene expression (transactivation) by the HIF1α CTAD, in contrast to the NTAD, is limited to hypoxic conditions independently of changes in HIF stability. Transactivation by the HIF1α CTAD is linked to its ability to recruit two coactivator proteins called p300 and cAMP-response element binding protein (CBP).<sup>109,110</sup> In the presence of oxygen, the HIF1α CTAD is hydroxylated on a specific asparaginyl residue by an enzyme called FIH-1 (factor inhibiting HIF1), which prevents the binding of p300 and CBP.<sup>111-114</sup> Thus, while prolyl hydroxylation of the NTAD by EGLN controls HIFα stability, asparaginyl hydroxylation of the CTAD by FIH-1 regulates HIF's transactivation potential by inhibiting coactivator recruitment (Fig 1).

### **ALTERNATIONS IN OXYGEN SENSING AND CANCER**

Given the role of pVHL in oxygen sensing, it is interesting to note that mutations affecting fumarate hydratase and succinate dehydrogenase can, like VHL mutations, give rise to hereditary renal cancer (fumarate hydratase) or pheochromocytoma (succinate dehydrogenase). These two enzymes catalyze sequential steps in the mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid cycle, which is used to generate ATP when oxygen is available. Germline succinate dehydrogenase mutations were originally described in a subset of families with head and neck paragangliomas, particularly of the carotid body.<sup>20</sup> The carotid body acts as an organismal oxygen sensor and is the most common site for head and neck paragangliomas.<sup>115</sup> Intriguingly, the incidence of carotid body tumors is also increased in individuals living at high altitudes (and who are thus chronically hypoxic).<sup>116</sup>

Hypoxia affects mitochondrial function. Conversely, there is evidence that mitochondria modulate the cellular response to hypoxia.<sup>117</sup> Collectively, these observations suggest that loss of pVHL, fumarate hydratase, or succinate

### **ALTERNATIVE FUNCTIONS OF pVHL**

Genotype-phenotype correlations in VHL disease suggest that pVHL has functions independent of its role in HIF regulation. First, pVHL mutants linked to type 2C disease seem to retain the ability to bind and polyubiquitylate HIF, suggesting that pheochromocytoma development in this setting is linked to gain or loss of a non-HIF pVHL function.<sup>94,121</sup> Second, pVHL mutants linked to type 2A and type 2B VHL disease share an inability to properly regulate HIF, suggesting that the integrity of a second pVHL function modifies the risk of renal cell carcinoma. Third, patients with Chuvash polycythemia, which is a hereditary polycythemia syndrome caused by homozygosity for a hypomorphic *VHL* allele (*VHL R200W*), do not appear to be tumor prone. This could reflect the fact that Chuvash pVHL R200W retains partial HIF polyubiquitylation activity, but could also indicate that it retains other, as yet unidentified, pVHL functions that suppress tumor formation.<sup>122,123</sup>

The existence of HIF-independent pVHL functions would offer one potential explanation for the observation that forced activation of HIF target genes, in the tissues examined to date, has not led to tumor formation. Overexpression of nondegradable forms of HIF, or HIF-like proteins, in mouse skin and rabbit musculature using a variety of approaches instead led to the proliferation of normal-appearing blood vessels.<sup>124-126</sup>

In keeping with these ideas, gene expression profiling studies suggest that pVHL has HIF-independent functions.<sup>127,128</sup> Moreover, a number of other pVHL-binding partners, including potential substrates, have been identified. Indeed, pVHL is reported to ubiquitylate proteins such as atypical protein kinase C<sup>129-132</sup>; a family of deubiquitinating enzymes named VHL-interacting deubiquitinase-1 and 2 (VDU1 and VDU2)<sup>133,134</sup>; and the hyperphosphorylated form of Rpbl, a subunit of RNA polymerase II.<sup>135</sup> pVHL has been reported to bind directly to the plant homeodomain protein Jade-1<sup>136</sup> and to a KRAB-A domain–containing protein (VHLaK). The latter may cooperate with pVHL to repress HIF-dependent transcription.<sup>137</sup>

Kim and Kaelin

In addition, pVHL has been implicated in diverse cellular processes (described following two sections) including regulation of the extracellular matrix (ECM), cytoskeletal stability, cell-cycle control, and differentiation, though the degree to which these different phenotypes are HIF-dependent and HIF-independent is still unclear.

### P VHL INTERACTS WITH THE EXTRACELLULAR MATRIX AND THE CYTOSKELETON

Early experiments showed that pVHL bound directly to fibronectin, a glycoprotein that interacts with integrins to bridge cells to the structural proteins of the ECM.¹³⁸ The association between pVHL and fibronectin seems to take place in association with the endoplasmic reticulum. Cells lacking pVHL do not deposit a proper extracellular fibronectin matrix, and this defect can be corrected by restoring pVHL function.¹³⁸,¹³⁹ How, mechanistically, the physical association of pVHL with fibronectin affects the fate of secreted fibronectin remains unclear. One study suggested that the defect in ECM formation in pVHL-defective cells was an indirect consequence of altered integrin expression.¹⁴⁰

Cells lacking pVHL are also more invasive and secrete higher levels of several matrix metalloproteases (enzymes able to degrade the basement membrane and ECM) and lower levels of a matrix metalloproteinase antagonist called TIMP-2 (tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 2)¹⁴¹ compared with their wild-type counterparts.

Epithelial cell behavior is clearly influenced by interactions with the ECM. Therefore, altered ECM production may contribute to tumorigenesis following pVHL inactivation. In keeping with this idea, pVHL-defective cells, in comparison with their wild-type counterparts, demonstrate increased proliferation and decreased differentiation when grown on specific matrices (such as matrigel or collagen type I) or as three-dimensional spheroids.¹³⁹,¹⁴²

A recent report showed that pVHL also interacts with the cytoskeleton, binding directly to microtubules and inhibiting their depolymerization.⁶² Interestingly, this function may be independent of E3 ubiquitin ligase formation, since a pVHL mutant lacking the elongin C binding domain was still capable of stabilizing microtubules. Moreover, this activity seemed to distinguish type 2A and type 2B pVHL mutants.⁶²

### CONTROL OF THE CELL CYCLE BY pVHL

Cells deficient in wild-type pVHL are unable to exit the cell cycle under certain experimental conditions, such as growth in low serum.¹⁴²,¹⁴³ This ability to exit the cell cycle can be restored by reintroduction of wild-type pVHL. Control of the cell cycle by pVHL is likely to be multifactorial.

Two recent reports implicate pVHL as a negative regulator of cyclin D1,¹⁴⁴,¹⁴⁵ which is a mitogen. Whether cyclin D1 is regulated by HIF is not clear at present. pVHL also negatively regulates transforming growth factor alpha (TGFα), recently described as a HIF target gene.¹⁴⁶ Intriguingly, renal tubular epithelial cells are particularly sensitive to the mitogenic effects of this cytokine.¹⁴⁷,¹⁴⁸

### MOUSE MODELS OF VHL

VHL−/− mice die during early embryogenesis, due to placental insufficiency.¹⁴⁹ An early report indicated that VHL+/− mice develop normally without evidence of tumor formation.¹⁴⁹ However, a second report, using a second independently derived VHL+/− mouse strain indicated that such mice have a normal life span but develop multiple vascular tumors in the liver, which loosely resemble hemangioblastomas and overexpress HIF target genes implicated in their human counterparts.¹⁵⁰ Similar liver lesions were observed, with higher penetrance and shorter latency, following conditional inactivation of VHL in the liver using Cre recombinase enzyme under the control of a hepatocyte-specific promoter.¹⁵⁰

### VHL'S ROLE IN TUMOR FORMATION AND THERAPEUTIC IMPLICATIONS

#### Hemangioblastomas

The most common manifestations of VHL disease are retinal and CNS hemangioblastomas. Histological examination of these hemangioblastomas reveals a mixture of lipid-laden “stromal cells,” endothelial cells, pericytes, and mast cells (Fig 2). The embryological origin of these stromal cells remains undefined. However, tissue microdissection, in situ hybridization, and immunohistochemical studies indicate that it is these cells, rather than the vascular components, that lack wild-type pVHL and that consequently overproduce HIF and its target gene products.²⁵,⁶⁴,¹⁵¹,¹⁵² It seems likely that overexpression of HIF targets such as VEGF and platelet-derived growth factor B (PDGF B) is responsible for the hypervascularity of these lesions since VEGF and PDGF B are potent mitogens for endothelial cells and pericytes, respectively. In addition, these stromal cells overproduce both TGFα and its receptor, epidermal growth factor receptor, which suggests the establishment of an autocrine loop.⁶³,¹⁵³

It is not yet clear whether mutations at non-VHL loci are required, in addition to VHL inactivation, for hemangioblastoma development. In one mouse model, forced activation of VEGF in the brain was sufficient to cause “hemangioblastoma-like” lesions in the brain.¹⁵⁴ In addition, inactivation of VHL in mice is sufficient to form hemangioblastoma-like tumors of the liver, as described earlier.¹⁵⁰ Collectively, these studies suggest that VHL

**Fig 2. Pathogenesis of von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL)-associated hemangioblastoma and renal cell carcinoma. In hemangioblastoma, biallelic VHL inactivation in a poorly defined “stromal cell” stabilizes hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) leading to overproduction of HIF-responsive proteins such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and platelet-derived growth factor B (PDGF B), which stimulate blood vessel endothelial cells and pericytes, respectively, and transforming growth factor alpha (TGFα), which acts as an autocrine growth factor. In renal cell carcinoma, biallelic VHL inactivation in a renal tubular epithelial cell stabilizes HIF, correlating with the formation a premalignant renal cyst. Alterations at other loci are probably required for carcinoma development. In VHL disease, the first VHL mutation (hit) is present in the germline.**

inactivation is sufficient for the development of CNS and retinal hemangioblastomas.

Although it has not been formally proven that inhibition of HIF is sufficient to alter the growth of VHL−/− tumors, it seems reasonable given the above considerations, to treat hemangioblastomas with agents that block HIF or its downstream targets. Two groups have now shown that inhibition of HIF2α is sufficient to suppress VHL−/− tumor growth in vivo. A number of agents that inhibit VEGF, PDGF, and TGFα are currently undergoing preclinical and clinical testing. Among these are drugs that prevent the receptors for these various growth factors from transmitting signals following ligand binding (Fig 3).

There have been case reports on the use of targeted therapy for VHL-associated hemangioblastomas. One VHL patient with an optic nerve hemangioblastoma had a dramatic and sustained improvement in her visual acuity and an expansion of her visual field following treatment with SU5416, which is an inhibitor of the VEGF receptor KDR. Direct visualization of the tumor, however, did not show appreciable change in its size, leading the authors to conjecture that the clinical improvements were due to decreased peritumoral edema as a consequence of blocking the vascular permeability effects of VEGF. In a second report, three patients with VHL-associated CNS hemangioblastomas were also treated with SU5416. Interestingly, all three patients developed polycythemia without demonstrable changes in the size of their tumors 8 to 10 weeks after initiation of therapy. The mechanism of this polycythemia was not elucidated, but it might, in theory, have been due to increased tumor hypoxia. Another VHL patient with a progressive metastatic cerebellar hemangioblastoma was treated with OSI-774 (Tarceva; OSI Pharmaceuticals, Melville, NY), a small molecule inhibitor of the epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase. This patient had subjective improvement in their neurological symptoms and remained on study for 9 months until clinical progression.

### Renal Cell Carcinoma

Examination of kidneys from VHL patients has revealed both preneoplastic renal cysts and renal cell carcinomas. Immunohistochemical and genetic evaluation of the epithelial cells lining these renal cysts show early loss of VHL and overexpression of HIF and HIF target genes such as

Fig 3. Potential therapeutic targets of the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein (pVHL) pathway. pVHL-defective hemangioblastomas and renal cell carcinomas fail to degrade hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) properly in the presence of oxygen. Consequently, these tumors overproduce several growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), platelet-derived growth factor B (PDGF-B), and transforming growth factor alpha (TGFα), which mediate their effects through transmembrane tyrosine kinases (VEGF receptor, platelet-derived growth factor receptor [PDGFR], and epidermal growth factor receptor [EGFR], respectively). Drugs that inhibit these growth factors or their receptors are in development.

shown activity in preclinical renal cell carcinoma models and are currently being tested in humans.¹⁷⁰ In one phase II study, a neutralizing VEGF antibody led to a significant improvement in time to progression in patients with metastatic renal carcinoma.¹⁷¹

### Pheochromocytoma

The role of VHL loss in pheochromocytoma formation remains enigmatic. As noted, type 2C mutants seem to retain the ability to downregulate HIF.¹²,¹²¹,¹²² At face value, this might suggest that HIF is not relevant to pheochromocytoma development following pVHL inactivation. On the other hand, it is intriguing that HIF2α is highly expressed in the adrenal medulla and the organ of Zuckerkandl.¹⁷³ It is also interesting that transcription of the tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) gene, which encodes the final and rate-limiting enzyme in catecholamine synthesis, is hypoxia inducible and seems to be regulated by pVHL.¹⁷⁴–¹⁷⁶ Also of note is the fact (alluded to previously) that almost all pheochromocytoma-associated pVHL mutants are missense mutants. This suggests that either complete loss of pVHL function prevents pheochromocytoma development (for example, profound dysregulation of HIF2α and TH might kill the precursor cells that give rise to pheochromocytoma) or that pheochromocytoma in this setting is due to a pVHL gain of function (for example, the pheochromocytoma-associated pVHL mutants might acquire the ability to bind to, and modulate, some other target).

### CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS

Many of the initial hypotheses and discoveries related to the functions of pVHL were grounded in careful clinical observations made by physicians. During the past decade, the scientific study of VHL has given us insights into not only the molecular basis for VHL disease but also the discovery of critical components of the mammalian oxygen-sensing pathway. The importance of HIF with respect to pVHL-defective tumor formation is already providing a rationale for testing small molecule inhibitors of HIF-responsive growth factors as potential treatments for renal cell carcinoma and hemangioblastoma.

However, many important questions remain. It is currently unknown why VHL mutations are linked to such a highly restricted subset of tumor types. Nor is it understood why specific VHL mutations are associated with different site-specific tumor risks. The answers to these questions may lie in understanding whether pVHL has tumor suppressive functions unrelated to its ability to inhibit HIF, and, if so, how the loss of these activities conspires with HIF to promote tumor growth. In addition, it will be important to identify the other genes that, when mutated, cooperate with VHL inactivation to cause cancer in specific tissues such as the kidney. As these questions are answered and our understanding of pVHL function becomes clearer, physicians and patients alike will
