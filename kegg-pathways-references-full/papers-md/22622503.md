Calcium (Ca²⁺) and magnesium (Mg²⁺) ions are involved in many vital physiological functions. In the human body, Ca²⁺ and Mg²⁺ homeostatic systems rely on three components: (i) tissues (re)absorbing or storing Ca²⁺ and Mg²⁺, mainly kidney, intestine, and bone; (ii) hormones that modulate the transport and mobilization of these minerals; and (iii) sensors controlling the transport of Ca²⁺ and Mg²⁺ in tissues. So far, the Ca²⁺-sensing receptor (CaSR) is the only known sensing mechanism involved in the response to systemic and local fluctuations in Ca²⁺ and Mg²⁺ concentrations. The tight coupling of the Ca²⁺ and Mg²⁺ homeostasis is frequently observed in humans and in animal models. Moreover, during the past decade, the intense research on mineral disorders, seen in the course of chronic kidney disease with secondary hyperparathyroidism, has revealed the interplay between Ca²⁺ and Mg²⁺ homeostasis. Altogether this evidence points to the CaSR as an interesting target to study mutual disturbances in Ca²⁺ and Mg²⁺ balance. Although many homeostatic processes involving CaSR in the parathyroid glands and kidneys have been elucidated, the current knowledge of the inter-regulation of divalent handling by the CaSR is still limited. Insight into the systemic and local sensing of Ca²⁺ and Mg²⁺ by the CaSR, as well as the identification of other receptors/sensors for these cations, will unravel the mechanism controlling their coupled regulation, and will lead to new treatment concepts for mineral disorders.

The cloning and characterization of the extracellular calcium (Ca²⁺)-sensing receptor (CaSR) from parathyroid glands, kidney, and several other cell types have demonstrated that Ca²⁺ ions can participate actively in their own regulation through receptor-mediated interactions.¹⁻³ In the parathyroid, CaSR controls peripheral Ca²⁺ homeostasis in the kidney, bone, and intestine by modulating the secretion of the parathyroid hormone (PTH) in response to low circulating levels of ionized Ca²⁺. In other tissues, local CaSR activation triggers adaptive responses to microenvironmental variations in Ca²⁺ levels.

CaSR belongs to family C of the superfamily of G protein-coupled receptors that also includes the receptors for the main neurotransmitters glutamate and γ-aminobutyric acid. The CaSR consists of an extracellular domain of 612 amino acids, a 250 amino acid transmembrane domain of seven transmembrane helices, and a 200 amino acid carboxy-terminal C-tail.⁴ At the plasma membrane, CaSR resides as a disulfide-linked dimer. The presence of two or more binding sites for Ca²⁺ on each monomer results in a positive cooperativity that allows the receptor to respond over a narrow range of ligand concentrations, compared with other members of the same family. Mg²⁺, Sr²⁺, La³⁺, Gd³⁺, and highly positively charged organic compounds, such as polyamines (e.g., spermine), aminoglycoside antibiotics (e.g., neomycin), protamine, and polyarginine are also able to activate the receptor, even in the absence of extracellular Ca²⁺. These polycationic agonists are termed type I agonists. Type 2 agonists, in contrast, require the presence of Ca²⁺ to activate CaSR and include L-amino acids and other organic compounds that act as allosteric activators of the receptor (the so-called calcimimetics).

Upon agonist binding, conformational changes in the transmembrane domain and intracellular domains trigger a number of intracellular signaling pathways. A characteristic signature of CaSR activation is the mobilization of intracellular Ca²⁺ via activation of phospholipase C. This leads to modulation of the activity of many channels and receptors, hormone secretion (e.g., PTH, calcitonin, growth hormone, adrenocorticotropic hormone, gastrin, insulin), and regulation of cellular activities such as proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and gene expression.⁵⁻⁶ Initially investigated in parathyroid glands and kidney, CaSR-mediated processes

The study of activating and inactivating CaSR mutations in human disorders,¹¹⁻¹³ the development of mouse models for CaSR defects,¹⁴,¹⁵ and the identification of genetic polymorphisms in the CaSR gene¹⁶,¹⁷ have delineated a pivotal role for the receptor in divalent mineral ion (Ca²⁺ and Mg²⁺) homeostasis, phosphate (Pᵢ) metabolism, and water reabsorption. This review aims to summarize our current knowledge about Ca²⁺- and Mg²⁺-sensing mechanisms, with special attention to the clinical implications of CaSR-based therapeutics on Ca²⁺ and Mg²⁺ handling.

### ROLE OF THE CaSR IN Ca²⁺ AND Mg²⁺ HOMEOSTASIS

#### Parathyroid gland
Maintenance of the plasma ionized Ca²⁺ and an Mg²⁺ concentration within a narrow range (1.12–1.32 and 0.44–0.59 mmol/l, respectively) relies on the coordinated actions of the kidney, intestine, and bone under the hormonal and sensing control by the parathyroid glands (Figure 1).

In response to hypocalcemia, reduced binding of Ca²⁺ to CaSR in the parathyroid induces rapid PTH release from secretory granules, delays PTH degradation, and eventually results in parathyroid hyperplasia (Figure 2). Increased levels of circulating PTH restore normal plasma Ca²⁺ values through: (i) resorption of Ca²⁺ from bone; (ii) directly increasing Ca²⁺ reabsorption in the distal part of the nephron via the transient receptor potential vanilloid 5 (TRPV5)¹⁸ channel; and (iii) stimulating activation of vitamin D (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D₃ (1,25(OH)₂D₃), or calcitriol) synthesis in the cells of the proximal tubule of the nephron. 1,25(OH)₂D₃ promotes absorption of dietary

Figure 2 | Key regulators of PTH expression and PTH secretion in a parathyroid gland cell model. Fluctuations in plasma Ca²⁺ and Mg²⁺ levels modulate PTH release from secretory granules via CaSR-mediated signaling. In hypocalcemic conditions, 1,25(OH)₂D₃ can bind its receptor VDR and act as negative feedback mechanism on PTH and CaSR promoters. When hyperphosphatemia occurs, FGF23 binds to the Klotho/FGFR1 complex and inhibits the PTH expression and release. More recently, it has been hypothesized that the NaK-ATPase/Klotho complex can regulate PTH secretion.

Ca²⁺ in the small intestine and release of Ca²⁺ mineralized in bones. As negative feedback, 1,25(OH)₂D₃ represses the transcription of *PTH*¹⁹ and may have an indirect effect on PTH release by increasing the expression of CaSR (Figure 2).²⁰

In a hypercalcemic situation, CaSR inhibits PTH release and stimulates the secretion of calcitonin by the thyroid C cells. Calcitonin secretion represents a robust defense against hypercalcemia via decreased osteoclast-mediated bone resorption.²¹

While hormonal regulation governing Ca²⁺ (re)absorption and mobilization from tissues has been extensively investigated, the regulatory mechanisms responsible for the systemic Mg²⁺ handling are still largely unknown.

Generally, Mg²⁺ can modulate PTH secretion in a way similar to Ca²⁺.²²⁻²⁴ Increasing Mg²⁺ levels inhibits PTH release²⁵ and reduces agonist-stimulated cAMP accumulation in parathyroid.²⁶ Furthermore, diverse studies in either hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis patients have reported an inverse relationship between plasma PTH and dialysate Mg²⁺ content.²⁷,²⁸ Nevertheless, in different expression systems, Ca²⁺ has been found to be a more potent stimulator of PTH secretion than Mg²⁺.²³,²⁵,²⁹ However, *in vivo*, the concentration of Mg²⁺ in the local microenvironment within the parathyroid might differ significantly from its level in the blood.

The differences between the effects of Ca²⁺ and Mg²⁺ on the CaSR-mediated secretory responses might reside in their ability to bind to the receptor and/or in their involvement in the cell signaling cascade initiated by the CaSR.³⁰ A recent

publication by Li et al.³¹ reports for the first time a second-messenger role for Mg²⁺ in receptor-induced phospholipase Cγ1 and Ca²⁺ signaling in lymphoid and non-lymphoid tissues. Their findings suggest that Ca²⁺ transport into the intracellular compartment can be secondary to Mg²⁺ influx. Further research should investigate how fluctuations in the intracellular Mg²⁺ concentration in the parathyroid glands influence CaSR signaling, Ca²⁺ influx, and, ultimately, PTH secretion.

### Kidney

Renal CaSR is an integral component of the homeostatic mechanisms that locally regulate mineral and water reabsorption in a PTH-independent manner.³² In the kidney, CaSR is expressed widely along the nephron and exhibits segment-specific cellular polarization (Figure 1).

In the proximal tubule of the nephron, CaSR is apical and its expression is modulated by 1,25(OH)₂D₃,²⁰,³³ PTH, and dietary Pi.³⁴ In this segment, CaSR controls PTH-dependent Pi excretion and can affect 1,25(OH)₂D₃ synthesis via the renal cytochrome P450 enzyme 25-hydroxyvitamin D₃-1α-hydroxylase.³⁵,³⁶ The majority of Ca²⁺ and Mg²⁺ reabsorption occurs in the PT and in the thick ascending limb of Henle (TAL) via passive paracellular transport mediated by claudin-16 and claudin-19 (Figure 1).³⁷ Claudin-16 and claudin-19 proteins form cation-permeable channels, and, when mutated, are a cause of familial hypomagnesemia with hypercalciuria and nephrocalcinosis (FHHNC; OMIM 248250).³⁷ Interestingly, CaSR agonists (such as Ca²⁺ and Mg²⁺) can induce lysosomal degradation of claudin-16 in vitro. In the kidney, this would lead to Ca²⁺ and Mg²⁺ wasting in the pro-urine.³⁸

In TAL, the apical Na⁺-K⁺-2Cl⁻ cotransporter NKCC2 and the renal outer medullary potassium channel renal outer medullary potassium (ROMK) generate a lumen-positive transepithelial potential difference, which drives cation reabsorption (largely Ca²⁺ and Mg²⁺, but also Na⁺) through the paracellular route.³⁹ During hypercalcemia, activation of the basolateral CaSR inhibits ROMK and NKCC2, resulting in the dissipation of the driving force for paracellular transport, leading to Na⁺, Ca²⁺, and Mg²⁺ wasting.⁴⁰ Similarly, pharmacological inhibition of NKCC2 by furosemide completely abolishes the transepithelial voltage gradient across the TAL, and therefore drastically inhibits Ca²⁺ and Mg²⁺ reabsorption. Mutations in the genes for NKCC2, ROMK, CaSR, the chloride channel ClC-kb, and its accessory protein Barttin are the causative defects for different variants of the salt-wasting disorder known as Bartter's syndrome.⁴¹⁻⁴³ Although all of the Bartter's syndrome types are caused by inhibition of transport in the TAL due to a full or partial dissipation of the electrochemical gradient, there is a considerable and unexplained variability in the consequences of faulty divalent cation handling.⁴⁴

In the distal convoluted tubule (DCT), Ca²⁺ and Mg²⁺ reabsorption relies on active transcellular processes. The early DCT (DCT1) determines the final urinary Mg²⁺ concentration by reabsorbing 5–10% of the filtered Mg²⁺ via the epithelial transient receptor potential melastatin 6 (TRPM6) (Figure 1).⁴⁵,⁴⁶ Recent studies demonstrated that CaSR activity reduces cell surface expression of the basolateral K⁺ channel Kir4.1.⁴⁷ This channel provides K⁺ ions to the NaK-ATPase, which maintains a local negative membrane potential essential for transcellular Mg²⁺ reabsorption in DCT1.⁴⁸,⁴⁹ Evidence for a crosstalk between CaSR and Kir4.1 suggests that activating mutations in the CaSR¹¹ as well as loss of function mutations in Kir4.1 (refs. 48, 49) might affect renal Na⁺ reabsorption and cause Mg²⁺ wasting through the same mechanism. In the late DCT (DCT2) and connecting tubules, CaSR is likely to control the transcellular Ca²⁺ reabsorption via modulation of apical Ca²⁺ entry through TRPV5 and/or basolateral Ca²⁺ efflux mediated by the Na⁺-Ca²⁺ exchanger (NCX1) and the Ca²⁺-ATPase (PMCA1B).⁵⁰,⁵¹ During hypocalcemic conditions, calciotropic hormones, including 1,25(OH)₂D₃ and PTH, increase the expression and/or enhance the channel open probability of TRPV5.⁵²,⁵³ Experiments conducted in TRPV5 knockout (TRPV5⁻/⁻) mice elucidated an intriguing role of CaSR in the collecting duct. In this segment of the nephron, increased urinary Ca²⁺ levels activate the luminal CaSR, enhancing activity of the H⁺-ATPase proton pump and downregulating the aquaporin 2 water channel.⁵⁴ The consequent decrease in urinary pH and polyuria protects the TRPV5⁻/⁻ mice from the risk of developing renal CaPi deposits. These adaptive mechanisms in a renal hypercalciuric mouse model indicate that renal CaSR and other local molecular actors could be novel therapeutic targets in preventing kidney stones in humans.

In conclusion, in vivo and in vitro studies showed that CaSR affects many molecular players involved in the paracellular and transcellular reabsorption of Ca²⁺ and Mg²⁺ in the kidney. Moreover, it provides crucial basolateral- and luminal-sensing mechanisms that integrate and balance water and divalent mineral losses.

### Bone

The majority of body Ca²⁺ and Mg²⁺ is stored in the osseous tissue as hydroxyapatite, whitlockite, and amorphous CaPi crystals. Under physiological conditions, the maintenance of mineral stores in bone relies on the equilibrium between bone mineralization by osteoblasts and bone resorption by osteoclasts, the latter being a process that leads to mineral release into the extracellular fluids. Expression studies in bone reported CaSR transcripts in preosteoblasts and osteoblasts, as well as in osteoclast precursors and mature osteoclasts.⁵,⁵⁵ Fluctuations in extracellular Ca²⁺ concentrations in vitro control osteoblast and osteoclast cell fate via pathways involving CaSR activation.⁵,⁵⁶ The bone abnormalities observed in global CaSR knockout mice (CaSR⁻/⁻) do not represent a conclusive evidence for the importance of the skeletal CaSR in vivo, as the hypercalcemia and hyperparathyroidism in these animals may be responsible for secondary effects on bone.⁵⁷,⁵⁸ Moreover, CaSR knockout is incomplete because of the gene targeting strategy that leads

to the expression of a CaSR splice variant able to compensate for the loss of full-length CaSR in bone and cartilage of these animals.⁵⁹ Chang *et al.*⁹ finally proved the critical role of the osteoblast CaSR in bone development, mineralization, and resorption, by generating a mouse model with an osteoblast-specific ablation of CaSR. These mice show profound bone defects that are independent of the calcitropic hormone axis and exclusively rely on local regulatory events that involve the skeletal CaSR.⁹,¹⁰

With respect to Ca²⁺ transport in bone, the TRP channels TRPV4, TRPV5, and TRPV6 are known to be involved in this process, as from *in vitro* studies and characterization of knockout mouse models.⁶⁰–⁶² At the ruffled border membrane of osteoclasts, the highly Ca²⁺-selective channel TRPV5 participates to remove the mineralized bone matrix (Figure 1),⁶²,⁶³ whereas TRPV4 regulates intracellular Ca²⁺ concentrations both in the osteoclast and osteoblast (Figure 1).⁶⁰ A recent study demonstrated that TRPV6 is also expressed in the bone mainly at the luminal side of the osteoclast and in osteoblasts, but it is not crucial for bone mineralization in mice (Figure 1).⁶¹ Up to now, no regulatory mechanism on TRP channels by CaSR in bone has been described.

Although Mg²⁺ stores in bone are the best indicator of total body Mg²⁺, the (patho) physiological role of Mg²⁺ in mineral mobilization remains unclear. Hypomagnesemia is generally associated with reduced bone mineral density in both rats and humans,⁶⁴ whereas hypermagnesemia is a risk factor for the development of adynamic bone disease, a condition characterized by abnormally low bone turnover.⁶⁵ In individuals whose renal function is not compromised, insufficient dietary Mg²⁺ intake has been linked to osteoporosis⁶⁶,⁶⁷ and the evidence for a loss of a magnesiotropic action of estrogens in Mg²⁺ homeostasis could be important in the development of postmenopausal osteoporosis.⁶⁸ Moreover, the use of proton-pump inhibitor drugs (PPIs) is associated with hypomagnesemia and increased risk of fractures.⁶⁹,⁷⁰

The mineral disturbances in chronic kidney disease (CKD) cause a spectrum of skeletal abnormalities, including osteitis fibrosa, osteomalacia, osteopenia, or osteoporosis, and adynamic bone disease. In studies on CKD patients, the differences in the management and complexity of mineral disturbances make it difficult to delineate a comprehensive overview of Mg²⁺:Ca²⁺ ratio in bone, renal osteodystrophy, and total body Mg²⁺ balance. Before initiation of dialysis, bone biopsies of end-stage renal disease patients with different degrees of renal osteodystrophy revealed an increase in the Mg²⁺:Ca²⁺ ratio with no increase in the total bone Mg²⁺ compared with healthy subjects.⁷¹ Studies conducted after 2-year dialysis on a 0.65 mmol/l Mg²⁺ dialysate showed an increase in bone Mg²⁺ content.⁷² The exact effect of Mg²⁺ before and after initiation of dialysis on bone mass, physical composition, and turnover is still unknown. The study of channels and transporters permitting Mg²⁺ to permeate bone cells and their crosstalk with divalent cation-sensing mechanisms in bone will elucidate the direct actions of Mg²⁺ on skeletal integrity.

Intestine

In mammals, CaSR is expressed in both the luminal and basolateral membrane of epithelial cells along the entire length of the small and large intestine. Here, the receptor plays a role in cell growth and differentiation, fluid transport, and nutrient sensing.⁷³ Ca²⁺ and Mg²⁺ absorption in the intestine consists of both para- and transcellular pathways, with the paracellular transport being the predominant route in high dietary Ca²⁺ and Mg²⁺ conditions.⁷⁴

The majority of ingested Ca²⁺ is absorbed via a paracellular route in multiple segments of the small intestine, whereas active transcellular Ca²⁺ absorption mainly occurs in the duodenum via TRPV6. The majority of Mg²⁺ is absorbed from the small intestine via a paracellular route and to a lesser extent from the colon via transcellular transport.⁷⁵ Colonic absorption of Mg²⁺ likely involves TRPM6.⁴⁵

Overall, the local role of intestinal CaSR on the regulation of divalent cation homeostasis is still largely unknown.

INTERPLAY OF Ca²⁺ AND Mg²⁺ METABOLISM

Genetic diseases of the CaSR suggest that Mg²⁺ and Ca²⁺ are both physiologically relevant CaSR agonists *in vivo*. Activating mutations in the CaSR result in autosomal dominant hypocalcemic hypercalciuria (OMIM 146200) that is associated with asymptomatic hypocalcemia, low plasma Mg²⁺, and PTH levels in the lower-to-normal range.¹¹ Interestingly, some activating mutations present a more severe phenotype similar to salt wasting syndrome (Gitelman's and Bartter's syndromes) with hypocalcemia, low PTH levels, renal Ca²⁺ wasting, nephrocalcinosis, hypomagnesemia, and hypermagnesuria.¹¹ Inactivating mutations of the CaSR, on the other hand, result in familial benign autosomal dominant hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (FHH, OMIM 145980), or its recessive form, neonatal severe hyperparathyroidism (OMIM 239200).⁷⁶ Patients affected with FHH or neonatal severe hyperparathyroidism exhibit hypercalcemia, hypermagnesemia, and normal to high levels of PTH. Mouse models for autosomal dominant hypocalcemic hypercalciuria and FHH resemble the human phenotype of the diseases.¹⁴,¹⁵

Mg²⁺ deficiency has been found to alter Ca²⁺ metabolism significantly in animals as well as in humans.⁴⁵,⁴⁶,⁷⁷ In particular, secondary hypocalcemia is commonly observed in patients with hypomagnesemia. Familial hypomagnesemia with secondary hypocalcemia (OMIM 602014) is an autosomal recessive disorder whose underlying cause is one of several mutations in the epithelial cation channel TRPM6.⁴⁵,⁴⁶ Unfortunately, homozygous deletion of *TRPM6* is embryonically lethal in mice, and therefore limiting our understanding of the effect of Mg²⁺ homeostatic defects on Ca²⁺ metabolism.⁷⁸ However, heterozygous deletion of *TRPM6* results in a mild hypomagnesemia with normocalcemia.⁷⁸ In these mice, a Mg²⁺-enriched diet could not compensate for low plasma Mg²⁺ levels. Similarly, enteral administration of Mg²⁺ keeps hypomagnesemia with secondary hypocalcemia patients normocalcemic, but does
not fully normalize plasma Mg²⁺ concentrations.⁷⁹ This suggests that the causative defect of hypocalcemia resided in the kidneys, whereas hypomagnesemia was derived from intestinal malabsorption of Mg²⁺. Subsequently, Walder et al.⁴⁶ demonstrated that hypomagnesemia in hypomagnesemia with secondary hypocalcemia patients also involved renal Mg²⁺ wasting. In fact, intravenous Mg²⁺ loading restored plasma Mg²⁺ and Ca²⁺ levels, with affected individuals having a lower threshold of urine Mg²⁺ excretion compared with control individuals. In accordance with other studies, Mg²⁺ supplementation increased urinary Ca²⁺ excretion.⁶⁸,⁸⁰ Bonny and co-workers⁸⁰ showed that the increased calciuric response to Mg²⁺ loading is a PTH-independent process that probably originates from the inhibition of TRPV5 by extracellular Mg²⁺ in the distal part of the nephron. Whether the binding of Mg²⁺ to the renal CaSR is involved in this process is unknown. In addition, a competitive transport of Mg²⁺ and Ca²⁺ via the common paracellular route in the TAL could explain the coupling between the urinary Mg²⁺ and Ca²⁺ excretion in response to different extracellular Mg²⁺ levels.⁶⁸

In the parathyroid glands, hypomagnesemia is expected to increase PTH secretion.²²⁻²⁴ Nevertheless, chronic Mg²⁺ deficiency can lead to the suppression of PTH release.⁸¹⁻⁸⁶ Most probably, prolonged hypomagnesemia causes intracellular Mg²⁺ depletion that in turn is responsible for the constitutive activation of the CaSR signaling, block of PTH secretion, and ultimately secondary hypocalcemia due to decreased reabsorption of Ca²⁺ by the kidney.³⁰ Thus, the occurrence of either an acute or a chronic Mg²⁺ deficiency is likely on the basis of the discrepancies observed in the ability of this cation to modulate PTH release in the parathyroid glands.

Another hypothesis is that hypomagnesemia causes hypocalcemia due to the skeletal resistance to PTH. *In vitro* studies revealed that exposure to low extracellular Mg²⁺ concentrations causes less Ca²⁺ release from cultured fetal rat bone cells.⁸⁷ Similarly, bones from Mg²⁺-depleted animals released less Ca²⁺ than control bones when exposed to PTH.⁸⁸ Nevertheless, a PTH-independent mode could also be involved.⁸⁹

The study of Mg²⁺ homeostasis in experimental models of Ca²⁺-homeostatic disturbances will enable us to dissect the inter-regulatory mechanisms and the molecular players involved in the metabolism of these two cations.⁶²,⁹⁰,⁹¹

### PERTURBATIONS IN Ca²⁺ AND Mg²⁺ METABOLISM IN RENAL FAILURE

Disturbances of mineral metabolism, primarily hyperphosphatemia, are common during the course of CKD, and are classically accompanied by secondary hyperparathyroidism, bone disorders, and ectopic calcifications in soft tissues. Under physiological conditions, the bone-kidney-parathyroid axis controls Pi and Ca²⁺ homeostasis via a regulatory loop that includes the fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), Klotho, 1,25(OH)₂D₃, and PTH. Klotho was first identified as an aging suppressor.⁹² It is mainly expressed in the kidney and parathyroid as single-span transmembrane protein, but is also secreted in blood and urine upon extracellular shedding. Secreted and intact Klotho exerts multiple biological actions in Pi and Ca²⁺ metabolism. In the DCTs of the kidney, Klotho has a stimulatory effect on TRPV5 activity,⁹³ whereas in the parathyroid glands, it enhances the cell surface expression of the NaK-ATPase pump to generate the driving force for PTH secretion (Figure 2).⁹⁴ Moreover, Klotho works as co-receptor for the phosphaturic hormone FGF23.⁹⁵,⁹⁶ Circulating Pi and 1,25(OH)₂D₃ positively regulate FGF23 release from bone.⁹⁷,⁹⁸ Binding of the secreted FGF23 to the Klotho/FGFR1 complex suppresses Pi reabsorption and 1,25(OH)₂D₃ synthesis, in the kidney,⁹⁹ whereas it decreases PTH secretion, in the parathyroid.¹⁰⁰ Klotho expression is induced by 1,25(OH)₂D₃¹⁰¹ and repressed by FGF23.¹⁰² With the progression of CKD, Klotho levels decline,¹⁰³ causing FGF23 resistance, significant increase in FGF23 and PTH release, hypovitaminosis D, and hyperphosphatemia. Deletions of Klotho (*Klotho⁻/⁻*) or FGF23 (*FGF23⁻/⁻*) in a mouse model lead to hyperphosphatemia, vascular calcification, and osteopenia, a phenotype that resembles the mineral and bone disease observed in CKD.⁹¹,⁹² On the other hand, Hu et al.¹⁰³ showed that transgenic mice overexpressing Klotho developed less severe vascular calcifications via a direct inhibition of Pi uptake by vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) in combination with enhanced phosphaturia and improved glomerular filtration. The authors confirmed that Klotho supplementation might have therapeutic potential for CKD, as previously proposed by Nakatani et al.¹⁰⁴,¹⁰⁵ The current therapy for mineral and bone disorder in CKD mainly includes: use of 1,25(OH)₂D₃ analogs, use of calcimimetic agents, control of Pi via dietary restrictions, and use of oral Pi binders, parathyroidectomy, and adjustment of dialysate mineral composition.

In addition to Pi and Ca²⁺ imbalance, renal failure is the most common cause of hypomagnesemia. With the progression of CKD (glomerular filtration rate < 30 ml/min), urinary Mg²⁺ excretion may be insufficient to balance intestinal Mg²⁺ absorption, therefore causing high plasma Mg²⁺ levels. Dietary control of Mg²⁺ intake and the Mg²⁺ content of the dialysate are largely responsible for controlling Mg²⁺ balance in dialysis patients. The Mg²⁺ concentration commonly used in peritoneal dialysis solutions is 0.25–0.75 mmol/l and 0.75 mmol/l in hemodialysis, and is directly related to plasma Mg²⁺ concentrations.²⁷,²⁸ Recent studies reported that circulating Mg²⁺ levels inversely correlate with vascular calcification among end-stage renal disease patients¹⁰⁶ and with carotid intima-media thickness in hemodialysis patients.¹⁰⁷ As cardiovascular disease accounts for premature death in about 50% of dialysis patients, the monitoring of plasma Mg²⁺ together with Ca²⁺ and Pi is crucial in CKD patients. In the general population, Mg²⁺ acts as a vasodilator and influences blood pressure, in part, by regulating peripheral vascular resistance and reactivity.¹⁰⁸ Mg²⁺ deficiency is associated with endothelium dysfunction and atherosclerosis, whereas Mg²⁺ administration is linked toa decrease in blood pressure and significant improvement of endothelial function and VSMC response. ${ }^{109}$ In patients affected by Gitelman's syndrome, characterized by hypocalciuria and hypomagnesemia, $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ also reduced the recurrence of acute ectopic deposition of idiopathic $\mathrm{CaP}_{\mathrm{i}}$ crystals in the extracellular fluid. ${ }^{110}$

Vascular calcification occurs in the vessel walls via a combination of extracellular and intracellular nanocrystal deposition, cellular differentiation towards an osteoblast-like phenotype, and cell apoptosis. ${ }^{111}$ A recent study in a rat model of chronic renal failure showed that the calcimimetic AMG 641 could slow down the progression of vascular calcification. ${ }^{112}$ Moreover, *in vitro*, calcimimetic R-568 inhibited mineral deposition in VSMC via local activation of CaSR. ${ }^{113,114}$ CaSR expression in the VSMC decreases, as the vessels calcify, following the progression of kidney failure. ${ }^{115}$ One of the TRPC channels is probably responsible for $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ entry in VSMC after CaSR activation. ${ }^{116}$ As extracellular $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ has been shown to negatively regulate calcification in VSMC through increased activity of the cation channel TRPM7, ${ }^{117}$ it would be interesting to investigate whether $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ entry can modulate CaSR-mediated $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ influx in these cells.

Another therapeutic option in CKD patients makes use of vitamin D derivatives. $1,25(\mathrm{OH})_{2} \mathrm{D}_{3}$ sterols lowers PTH levels and minimizes hyperphosphatemia by stimulating skeletal FGF23 secretion. $F G F 23^{-/-}$ and $K l o t h o^{-/-}$ mice exhibit atherosclerosis and ectopic calcifications. ${ }^{92,92}$ Lowering the plasma $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{i}}$ levels or genetically reducing $1,25(\mathrm{OH})_{2} \mathrm{D}_{3}$ rescued much of the phenotype in $K l o t h o^{-/-}$ mice, suggesting both a vitamin D-dependent and -independent inhibition of ectopic calcifications. ${ }^{118}$ In accordance with observations in uremic animals, the use of $1,25(\mathrm{OH})_{2} \mathrm{D}_{3}$ analogs in CKD patients is associated with a decrease in intima-media thickness and coronary artery calcification. ${ }^{119}$ Of note, the use of $1,25(\mathrm{OH})_{2} \mathrm{D}_{3}$ analogs before the initiation of dialysis and in more advanced stage of CKD, when vitamin D resistance occurs, needs to be carefully monitored to prevent hypercalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, and metastatic calcifications.

It has been reported that vitamin D increases $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ absorption in the jejunum. ${ }^{120}$ Nevertheless, increased plasma $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ levels due to therapy with vitamin D derivatives might not be sufficient to reduce PTH release in the parathyroid gland via CaSR activation and to prevent medial calcification in arteries.

As renal function deteriorates, the control of $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{i}}$ relies on the use of agents that bind ingested $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{i}}$ in the intestinal lumen to limit its absorption. ${ }^{121}$ To this end, a variety of compounds with different limitations have been used, that is, aluminum hydroxide, $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-based compounds, $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ salts, and non-$\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ containing, non-aluminum containing $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{i}}$ binders. The use of $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ salts in patients with renal failure before initiation of dialysis should be monitored to avoid the side effects of hypermagnesemia, but they can be safely used in combination with low $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ dialysate. $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$-based $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{i}}$ binders may contribute to lower PTH levels by a calcimimetic effect of $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ on CaSR in the parathyroid glands and at the same time may improve cardiovascular outcomes via local CaSR modulation. It seems worthwhile to investigate whether $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}-\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ combined preparations represent a suitable compromise between effectiveness, low toxicity, low risk of hypercalcemia, and beneficial effects on the cardiovascular system. ${ }^{122}$ As mineralized vessels and bone are both composed of mainly hydroxyapatite, whitlockite, and $\mathrm{CaP}_{\mathrm{i}}$ crystals, unravelling the differential ion transporters and sensors involved in vascular calcification and bone formation is essential for the development of target-specific $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$- or $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$-based therapies. ${ }^{111}$

**ALTERNATIVE $\mathbf{C a}^{2+}$- AND $\mathbf{M g}^{2+}$-SENSING MECHANISMS**

$\mathrm{CaSR}^{-/-}$ mice die within the first few weeks of life due to the severe hypercalcemia and hyperparathyroidism, ${ }^{15}$ confirming the central, non-redundant role of the CaSR in mineral ion metabolism. Nevertheless, the existence of other functional CaSR variants or alternative $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-sensing mechanisms cannot be excluded. ${ }^{59}$ Positional cloning approaches in families with FHH provide evidence for the existence of alternative receptors or mediators of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ regulation, mapping at loci other than CaSR. ${ }^{123,124}$ FHH consists of three defined types, FHH1, FHH2, and FHH3 (also referred to as Oklahoma variant, $\mathrm{FHH}_{\mathrm{Ok}}$ ), whose chromosomal locations are $3 q 21.1,19 p$, and $19 q 13$, respectively. ${ }^{123,125,126}$ FHH1 is caused by mutations in the CaSR gene in more than $65 \%$ of patients, but the abnormalities underlying FHH2 and FHH3 are unknown. ${ }^{127}$ Genes that reside in the associated candidate regions might encode for other $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ sensors or proteins involved in processes upstream or downstream of CaSR activation. ${ }^{128}$

The actions of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ could potentially also be mediated by one or more of the metabotropic glutamate receptors that sense $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ (i.e. metabotropic glutamate receptors 1, 3, and 5). Interestingly, the extracellular domain of the G protein-coupled receptors CaSR, γ-aminobutyric acid B and metabotropic glutamate receptors show a significant degree of sequence homology to the bacterial periplasmic nutrient-binding protein. One of the bacterial periplasmic nutrient-binding proteins, named PhoQ, acts as extracellular $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ sensor. ${ }^{129}$ PhoQ induces production of $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ transport proteins in response to environmental $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ deprivation in Salmonella. Although phylogenetics is a constant aid to $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ research in eukaryotes, ${ }^{130}$ so far none of the known eukaryotic proteins responsive to $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ has been associated with divalent cation-sensing properties. ${ }^{131}$

**CONCLUSIONS**

Primary disturbances of the $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ balance often display a concomitant disturbance of $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ homeostasis and vice versa. Nevertheless, the cascades of cellular and molecular events that lead to the combined disturbances of these cations are mostly unknown. While the hormonal regulation governing $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ reabsorption and mobilization from tissues has been largely investigated, a comprehensive regulatory
mechanism describing systemic Mg²⁺ handling is still missing. So far, the epidermal growth factor¹³² and estrogens⁶⁸ are the only magnesiotropic hormones known to directly affect Mg²⁺ metabolism via stimulation of the epithelial Mg²⁺ channel TRPM6.

The CaSR plays a unique role in sensing systemic and local fluctuations of both Ca²⁺ and Mg²⁺ concentrations. In the parathyroid, the effects of elevated levels of Mg²⁺ on CaSR mimic those of Ca²⁺, as Mg²⁺ can similarly modulate PTH secretion. Moreover, CaSR plays important regulatory roles in other tissues independent of the calcitropic hormone axis. For example, mutations in the CaSR cause disturbances in Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺, and water reabsorption, mainly due to defects in renal CaSR signaling. The study of CaSR-mediated events following Ca²⁺ and Mg²⁺ sensing in health and disease provide insights into the regulation of Ca²⁺ and Mg²⁺ handling.

Currently, calcimimetics that target the CaSR are successfully applied to control secondary hyperparathyroidism in CKD patients by lowering circulating PTH, Pi, and Ca²⁺ levels, which in turn decreases vascular calcifications. Interestingly, extracellular Mg²⁺ negatively regulates vascular calcification and osteogenic differentiation in the presence of high Pi and high Ca²⁺ concentrations. It has been hypothesized that calcimimetics, as well as Mg²⁺, can activate local cation-sensing mechanisms that protect from ectopic mineralization processes. This observation evokes some interesting hypotheses that remain untested: (i) the existence of alternative CaSR isoforms involved in local sensing of divalent cations; (ii) the existence of an unknown Mg²⁺ sensor; and (iii) a role of intracellular Mg²⁺ in the regulation of CaSR-mediated events that lead to Ca²⁺ entry.

In conclusion, the central role of the CaSR in the tight coupling of Ca²⁺ and Mg²⁺ metabolism suggests that the homeostasis of both these divalent cations has to be carefully monitored during the treatment of mineral disorders.
