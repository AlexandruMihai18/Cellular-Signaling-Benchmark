## Summary

Plants have at least two major photosensory receptors: phytochrome (absorbing primarily red/far-red light) and cryptochrome (absorbing blue/UV-A light); considerable physiological and genetic evidence suggests some form of communication or functional dependence between the receptors. Here, we demonstrate in vitro, using purified recombinant photoreceptors, that *Arabidopsis* CRY1 and CRY2 (cryptochrome) are substrates for phosphorylation by a phytochrome A-associated kinase activity. Several mutations within the CRY1 C terminus lead to reduced phosphorylation by phytochrome preparations in vitro. Yeast two-hybrid interaction studies using expressed C-terminal fragments of CRY1 and phytochrome A from *Arabidopsis* confirm a direct physical interaction between both photoreceptors. In vivo labeling studies and specific mutant alleles of CRY1, which interfere with the function of phytochrome, suggest the possible relevance of these findings in vivo.

## Introduction

Blue light responses occur in a wide variety of organisms throughout the biological kingdom, and many of these are thought to be mediated by flavin-type blue light receptors. Recently, one such photoreceptor (CRY1) has been isolated by cloning of an *Arabidopsis thaliana* gene, HY4, conferring responsivity to blue light (Ahmad and Cashmore, 1993, 1996a). The HY4-encoded protein (named CRY1 for cryptochrome) shows significant homology to microbial type I DNA photolyases, a rare class of flavoprotein that carries out light-dependent reactions (Sancar, 1994). The region of homology is most striking in the chromophore-binding domain, and CRY1 has been shown to bind both a flavin and a pterin chromophore (Lin et al., 1995; Malhotra et al., 1995). In addition, CRY1 encodes a domain of 200 amino acids (aa) at the C terminus not found in photolyases, which is thought important for protein/protein interaction and is essential for function (Ahmad et al., 1995). Although so strikingly similar to photolyases, CRY1 has no photoreactivation activity, and this function is fulfilled by an entirely unrelated enzyme in *Arabidopsis* (Ahmad et al., 1997). CRY1, together with a related gene family member CRY2 (Hoffman et al., 1996; Lin et al., 1996b), carries out an extensive variety of blue light-sensing functions (Ahmad et al., 1995, 1998a, 1998b; Jackson and Jenkins, 1995; Bagnall et al., 1996). The cryptochrome photoreceptors are evolutionarily ancient, with homologs identified in numerous plant species including the green alga *Chlamydomonas reinhardtii* (Small et al., 1995). Intriguingly, there is evidence for enzymes with some relatedness to cryptochromes in humans (Hsu et al., 1996; van der Spek et al., 1996; Todo et al., 1997). Although more similar to 6-4 DNA photolyases than to the cryptochrome photoreceptors of plants, these human enzymes have been shown to lack DNA repair activity in vitro consistent with possible function as photoreceptors.

A recurring theme in the field of plant blue light research has been an involvement of the red/far-red light sensing photoreceptor phytochrome in cryptochrome-mediated responses (Gaba et al., 1984; Mohr, 1986, 1994; Mancinelli et al., 1991). Pretreatment of plant tissue with red light (which specifically activates the phytochrome photoreceptor) can significantly enhance cryptochrome-dependent responses to blue light, whereas far-red light (which converts phytochrome to the inactive Pr form) reduces responsiveness to blue light (Mohr, 1986, 1994). Genetic experiments with severely phytochrome-deficient single and double mutants demonstrate that a minimal level of active phytochrome is necessary for full cryptochrome activity; double mutants of *Arabidopsis* deficient in both phyA and phyB (the predominant phytochromes in plants) are impaired in CRY1-mediated inhibition of hypocotyl elongation and anthocyanin accumulation (Casal and Boccalandro, 1995; Ahmad and Cashmore, 1997). It appears that phytochrome is intimately involved in the functioning of the blue light receptors, and that there is a requirement for phytochrome for full activity of cryptochrome. Whether this dependence results from a direct interaction of both photoreceptors or occurs at a common intermediate step of their respective signaling pathways has remained unclear.

In recent years, there has been increasing awareness of the possibility that higher plant phytochromes may function as light-activated protein kinases (Elich and Chory, 1997). Phytochrome consists of a highly conserved N-terminal chromophore-binding domain fused to a relatively less well-conserved C-terminal effector domain (Quail et al., 1995). The C-terminal domains of all known higher plant phytochromes show significant amino acid sequence homology to bacterial sensor proteins that are known to be histidine kinases (HKs) (Schneider-Poetsch et al., 1991; Thummler et al., 1995a). A recently characterized prokaryotic phytochrome from *Synechocystis PCC6803* indeed shows virtual sequence identity to bacterial HKs (Hughes et al., 1997; Yeh et al., 1997) and has been demonstrated to retain HK activity towards a prokaryotic substrate (Yeh et al., 1997). A novel phytochrome identified in moss encodes a C-terminal domain quite divergent from that of the majority of plant phytochromes, with significant homology to protein-tyrosine kinases of *Dictyostelium discoideum* and to the Raf-Mos serine-threonine kinase family (Thummler et al., 1992; Algarra et al., 1993). This phytochrome

species was subsequently demonstrated to have serine/threonine kinase activity when expressed in fibroblast cell culture (Thummler et al., 1995b). Sequence alignment of the novel moss phytochrome with other plant phytochromes revealed significant regions of sequence conservation, although not in the canonical invariant residues characteristic of the eukaryotic protein kinases. Taken together, the sequence and phylogenetic data seem consistent with a scenario whereby the phytochromes originated from chromophore-bearing prokaryotic sensor proteins with HK activity and acquired novel specificity and mechanisms of action in the course of plant evolution.

Direct evidence of a phosphorylating activity associated with higher plant phytochrome was obtained from purified preparations of oat phyA (Wong et al., 1986). A polycation-stimulated, ATP-dependent activity associated with such preparations catalyzed the phosphorylation of serine residues on the photoreceptor itself, consistent with autophosphorylation, and on histone substrates (Wong et al., 1986, 1989). Affinity-purified recombinant oat PhyA expressed in the yeast *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* (Murphy and Lagarias, 1997) likewise had associated kinase activity, thereby strengthening the probability that phytochrome itself, and not some copurifying contaminant, is the kinase (Yeh and Lagarias, personal communication). Immunoprecipitates of maize phytochrome showed readily detectable autophosphorylation activity (Bierman et al., 1994), again strengthening the possibility that kinase activity of phytochrome itself, or some exceedingly closely associated copurifying kinase, has functional significance in phytochrome activity and providing strong support for the hypothesis that phytochrome-associated protein kinase modulates light responses in vivo.

Given the considerable physiological and genetic evidence of interaction between cryptochrome and phytochrome-associated signaling pathways, it was the goal of the present study to explore the possibility of direct interaction between these two important photoreceptor systems. In an in vitro approach, we ascertained whether CRY1 could serve as a substrate for phosphorylation by affinity-purified preparations of recombinant oat phyA. Such an event would be consistent with a functionally significant physical interaction between phytochrome and cryptochrome. A corollary approach involved the yeast two-hybrid expression system, using cloned C-terminal fragments of *Arabidopsis* CRY1 and phyA; such an approach provides evidence of physical interaction without the potential for artifact introduced by copurifying contaminants in receptor preparations. Finally, we have attempted to assess the relevance of our findings to events in the plant in vivo.

### Results

#### Phosphorylation of CRY1 by Phytochrome-Associated Kinase Activity In Vitro

Given the extensive photobiological and genetic evidence of some form of communication between the phytochrome and cryptochrome photoreceptors (Ahmad and Cashmore, 1997), we investigated the possibility that the blue light photoreceptor CRY1 is a substrate

for phytochrome-associated kinase activity. Full-length recombinant CRY1 protein was prepared from baculovirus-infected insect cells (Lin et al., 1995) and added to phosphorylation reaction buffer, together with purified recombinant oat phytochrome A affinity-purified from *S. cerevisiae* (Murphy and Lagarias, 1997) (Figure 1A). No phosphorylation of CRY1 was observed in the absence of phytochrome. Addition of phytochrome alone to the phosphorylation reactions resulted in the appearance of a phosphorylated species (approximately 120 kDa) that comigrated with phytochrome; this species represents autophosphorylated phytochrome, as previously described in such assays (Wong et al., 1986). Addition of CRY1 together with phytochrome resulted in the appearance of an additional phosphorylated species (MW approximately 80 kDa) comigrating with CRY1, demonstrating that CRY1 is phosphorylated in a phytochrome-dependent manner. The concentration of CRY1 in this assay was quite low (0.005 μg/μl), suggesting that the observed phosphorylation was significant. The degree of phosphorylation under red or blue light did not differ markedly; phosphorylation occurred also in the presence of far-red light, consistent with both Pr and Pfr forms of phytochrome being effective in the phosphorylation reaction (Wong et al., 1986, 1989).

The CRY1 photoreceptor consists of an amino-terminal domain of 500 aa with sequence homology to microbial type I photolyases; this domain has been shown to bind both pterin and flavin chromophores (Malhotra et al., 1995). The C-terminal domain, in contrast, is unique to the blue light photoreceptor gene family and is likely to be important for specific protein/protein interaction in the function of the photoreceptor (Ahmad and Cashmore, 1993). It was therefore of interest to determine which domain of CRY1 was phosphorylated by the phytochrome-associated kinase activity. An amino-terminal fragment of 506 aa comprising the entire chromophore-binding domain of CRY1 was expressed in *Escherichia coli* and purified by nickel-affinity column chromatography through an introduced polyhistidine tag (Figure 1B). This protein species was found to bind both chromophores (data not shown) and thereby was likely to be correctly folded. A C-terminal fragment of CRY1 comprising the C-terminal 170 amino acids of the photoreceptor was likewise expressed and purified from *E. coli* by polyhistidine tag on a nickel-affinity column (Figure 1B). The photoreceptor fragments were added to in vitro phosphorylation reactions in the presence of phytochrome; only the C-terminal fragment of CRY1 was phosphorylated (Figure 1C) and not the N-terminal chromophore-binding domain.

Phosphorylation of the CRY1 C-terminal fragment was found to be inhibited by pyrophosphate (PPi) (Figure 1D) and stimulated by polylysine (PL) (Figure 1E), in agreement with reported properties of the phytochrome-associated kinase activity (Wong, et al., 1986, 1989). The phosphorylation reaction is ATP-dependent, with a K<sub>m</sub> for ATP of approximately 30 μM (data not shown). Cold GTP added at a concentration of 500 μM did not inhibit the reaction (Figure 1D). The K<sub>m</sub> for phosphorylation of the CRY1 C-terminal fragment was determined by plotting the radioactive phosphate incorporation into the CRY1 C-terminal fragment (V) against the substrate concentration (S) (Figure 1F) in a Lineweaver-Burk plot,

to give an approximate value for K<sub>m</sub> in the range of 10<sup>-7</sup>M. A related cryptochrome photoreceptor, CRY2, has been identified in *Arabidopsis*. CRY2 shows considerable functional overlap with CRY1, although the relative contribution to many blue light responses in light-grown plant tissue is considerably less than that of CRY1 (Ahmad et al., 1998a). Like CRY1, CRY2 contains an N-terminal chromophore-binding domain and a C-terminal extension. CRY2 was evaluated for phosphorylation by phytochrome-associated kinase activity, using both full-length protein expressed in a baculovirus system and a small fragment comprising the C-terminal 106 aa, purified from *E. coli* (M. A. et al., unpublished data). Both full-length CRY2 and the purified C-terminal domain are phosphorylated (Figure 1G), as is the case with CRY1. We have determined that CRY1 is phosphorylated on serine residues (data not shown), consistent with the site of autophosphorylation of purified phyA (Lapko et al., 1997).

Analysis of mutations in CRY1 has led to the identification of numerous amino acid substitutions within the carboxy-terminal domain of the photoreceptor (Ahmad et al., 1995). To further explore the possible functional relevance of the phytochrome-associated phosphorylation reaction, we expressed and purified CRY1 C-terminal proteins harboring a number of these point mutations from *E. coli* (Figure 2A). These mutant proteins were assayed for in vitro phosphorylation by the phytochrome-associated kinase activity. Reduced phosphorylation was observed in HY4-9 and HY4-22 proteins at low substrate concentration (Figure 2B). Although the C-terminal domain of cryptochrome appears to be essential for function, there is relatively little amino acid sequence conservation in this domain between cryptochrome gene family members. In particular, CRY1 and CRY2 (Hoffman et al., 1996; Lin et al., 1996b) share only a very small region of homology comprising 8 aa (STAESSSS) within this domain (Figure 2A). We introduced a deletion of this conserved, serine-rich domain

into the CRY1 C terminus (ΔCRY1) and observed that the resulting expressed recombinant protein is a poorer substrate for phytochrome (Figure 2B), although phosphorylation at higher substrate concentrations still occurs. The fact that the deletion of this conserved region between two members of the *Arabidopsis* cryptochrome gene family affects the degree of phosphorylation by phytochrome supports the functional relevance of this interaction.

### Yeast Two-Hybrid Interaction Studies

Since purified photoreceptor preparations were used in the in vitro assays, there exists the formal possibility of a contaminating activity in these preparations unrelated to phytochrome, which could be responsible for the

et al., 1993) (Figure 3A). In addition to wild-type CRY1, a number of C-terminal domains containing point mutations were also introduced into this vector. In the case of phytochrome, two different fragments from the C terminus of the Arabidopsis PHYA gene were cloned into the bait plasmid pAS1, containing the Gal4 binding domain (BD) (Durfee et al., 1993) (Figure 3A). The smaller of these fragments (BD Phy 689–939) includes a region containing several hot spots for mutations, which is thought to be critical for the regulatory activity of phytochrome (Xu et al., 1995). This fragment also includes one of two conserved PAS domains in the phytochrome sequence (Lagarias et al., 1995; Zhulin et al., 1997). These PAS domains have been shown to be important for protein/protein interaction in a number of organisms (Huang et al., 1993). The larger of the PHYA fragments (BD Phy 624–1100) includes, in addition to these critical regulatory regions, two flanking domains known to be involved in dimerization of phytochrome (Quail et al., 1995; Quail, 1997), as well as the second putative PAS domain (Figure 3A). The expression of the fusion proteins was verified by Western blotting using anti-phyA or anti-CRY1 antibodies (data not shown).

The level of β-galactosidase expression in transformed yeast colonies was quantified using a colorimetric assay (Iwabuchi et al., 1993). We found that none of the control constructs, either containing phytochrome or containing cryptochrome gene sequences, showed significant induction of β-galactosidase activity when transformed singly into yeast (Figure 3B). This indicates that there was no artifactual activation of the system by these introduced sequences. When constructs containing the CRY1 sequences were cotransformed with constructs containing the smaller of the PHYA fragments (BD Phy 689–939), there was likewise very little detectable lacZ activity. However, when the larger PHYA-containing constructs (BD Phy 624–1100) were cotransformed with any of the pACT constructs containing cryptochrome sequences, a significant level of β-galactosidase activity was detectable (Figure 3B). The induction was more than 20-fold over background levels; this level of activity is indicative of a direct interaction between CRY1 and phytochrome protein fragments in living yeast cells.

In Vivo Labeling Studies
If the observed in vitro phosphorylation of cryptochrome by phytochrome does indeed have functional relevance, it is to be predicted that CRY1 is phosphorylated in vivo, and that this phosphorylation may be stimulated by red light. We performed in vivo labeling studies on transgenic Arabidopsis seedlings overexpressing CRY1 protein containing an engineered histidine tag at the N terminus (Lin et al., 1996a). CRY1 protein can be readily purified from such transgenic overexpressing plants by affinity column chromatography on nickel columns. Two-week-old Arabidopsis plants were dark-adapted for 2 days and then harvested and labeled with radioactive orthophosphate as described (see Experimental Procedures). Plant tissue was irradiated for 1 min either with red or red plus far-red light, then frozen in liquid nitrogen

phosphorylation reactions. It was therefore desirable to demonstrate a direct physical interaction between phytochrome and cryptochrome by independent means, and the yeast two-hybrid interaction cloning method was employed (Fields and Song, 1989; Chien et al., 1991). The C-terminal fragment of the Arabidopsis CRY1 gene was cloned into the yeast two-hybrid shuttle vector pACT containing the Gal4 activation domain (AD)(Durfee

C-terminal regions of phyA (aa 624–1100 and 689–939) from Arabidopsis (Sharrock and Quail, 1989) and C-terminal domains (aa 505–681) of wild-type and mutant versions of CRY1 (Ahmad et al., 1995) were amplified by PCR and subcloned into the NdeI-BamHI and BamI-XhoI sites of the two-hybrid shuttle/expression vectors pAS and pACT, respectively (Durfee et al., 1993).

and the CRY1 receptors purified, run on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and subjected to autoradiography (Figure 4). A phosphorylated protein of approximately 80 kDa was detectable, with stimulation of phosphorylation in extracts treated with red light as compared to dark or red plus far-red light. Western blot analysis of the samples showed the phosphorylated band to run at the precise position of CRY1, and that equivalent concentrations of CRY1 protein were obtained under each treatment so that the difference in phosphorylation was not to be ascribed to different protein concentrations (Figure 4). These data are consistent with in vivo phytochrome-stimulated phosphorylation of CRY1 in *Arabidopsis*.

### Specific Mutant CRY1 Alleles Are Impaired in Phytochrome Responses

If the cryptochrome blue light photoreceptors do indeed directly interact with phytochrome in vivo, the possibility exists that certain mutant forms of cryptochrome might interfere with the function of phytochrome by forming nonproductive associations that prevent interaction of phytochrome with its other substrates. Such dominant-negative impairment of phytochrome function is well-documented, occurring when nonfunctional fragments of phytochromes or nonfunctional phytochrome genes are overexpressed in transgenic plants, bind to the endogenous plant phytochromes, and interfere with proper dimerization or substrate interaction of these endogenous phytochromes (Boylan et al., 1994; Sakamoto and Nagatani, 1996; Wagner et al., 1996; Quail, 1997). We investigated a number of mutant alleles of *hy4* for possible impairment in red light responsivity due to such dominant-negative effects (Figure 5A). A null mutant of *hy4* lacking CRY1 protein (*hy4-2*) (Figure 5B) showed no detectable difference from wild-type in the inhibition of hypocotyl elongation response to red light (Figure 5C), consistent with previous findings (Koornneef et al., 1980; Young et al., 1992). However, two mutant alleles of *hy4*, which expressed mutant forms of CRY1 protein, were found to have reduced sensitivity to red light, with 10%–20% less responsiveness as compared either to a wild-type control or the null mutant seedlings (Figure 5C). One of these mutant forms (*hy4-3*) contains a deletion of 130 aa in the C-terminal domain of CRY1 resulting in a truncated protein (Figure 5B), while the other contains

a point mutation within the chromophore-binding domain (*hy4-6*) (Figures 5A and 5B).

Since the impairment in inhibition of hypocotyl elongation under red light was quite subtle, we investigated another phenotype that is quite sensitive even to small differences in the function of phytochrome B. The time to flowering under short-day conditions is dramatically reduced in mutants lacking phyB (Goto et al., 1991) and in mutants that may lie along the phyB signal transduction pathway (Ahmad and Cashmore, 1996b). In contrast, *hy4* null mutant plants under such conditions have been reported to be somewhat late-flowering in comparison to the parent (Bagnall et al., 1996). We observed late flowering under short days in the case of the *hy4-2* and *hy4-11* mutant alleles, which lack detectable CRY1 protein (Figure 5D and data not shown). However, the two alleles of *hy4* showing reduced responsiveness to red light flowered significantly earlier than the wild-type parent (*hy4-3* in comparison to parental ecotype WS; *hy4-6* in comparison to parental ecotype Columbia). Taken together with the reduced responsiveness to red light in the inhibition of hypocotyl elongation assay, these results are consistent with a direct interaction of the mutant alleles of CRY1 with phyB resulting in impaired function.

## Discussion

In this study, we have demonstrated that CRY1 and CRY2 blue light photoreceptors are phosphorylated by a phytochrome A-associated kinase activity in vitro. The

properties of this phosphorylation reaction are consistent with published observations of purified phytochrome preparations, including stimulation by polylysine, inhibition by pyrophosphate, ATP dependence, and phosphorylation on serine residues (Wong et al., 1989). Interestingly, in most instances using artificial substrates (for instance histone H1) there is considerable autophosphorylation of phytochrome, and the degree of labeling of the substrate is not much higher than that of the photoreceptor (Wong et al., 1986). An exception has been PEP carboxylase, a possible biologically relevant substrate for the kinase that had been shown in in vivo labeling studies to be phosphorylated in a light-dependent manner (Wong et al., 1989). Both full-length CRY1 (at high-enough concentration) and the C-terminal fragment of CRY1 and CRY2 were much more strongly labeled in phosphorylation reactions than was the phytochrome photoreceptor. Thus, cryptochromes as substrate are in this respect more similar to PEP carboxylase (a possible biological substrate) (Wong et al., 1989) than to a number of artificial substrates.

The site of phosphorylation by the phytochrome-associated kinase activity is within the C-terminal region of both CRY1 and CRY2, a distinct domain characteristic of the blue light photoreceptor gene family and not found in photolyases (Sancar, 1994). The C-terminal domain, though essential for function, is quite poorly conserved among members of the cryptochrome blue light photoreceptor gene family (Cashmore, 1997). The fact that a small, serine-rich conserved region within the C-terminal domain of both CRY1 and CRY2 affects the level of phosphorylation by phytochrome strengthens the argument that this phosphorylation is of biological significance.

The identity of the phosphorylation activity associated with phytochrome preparations has been a matter of some controversy. In a former report, this activity was found to disappear upon repeated rounds of purification of the plant phytochrome, leading to the speculation that the phosphorylation activity might represent some contaminant that was tightly associated with phytochrome preparations (Kim et al., 1989). However, the phosphorylation activity was simply lost and not recovered in any nonphytochrome fraction, begging the question of whether there was simply inactivation upon repeated rounds of purification. Reported identification of a contaminating kinase activity in purified phytochrome preparations (Grimm et al., 1989) was later found to be an artifact and turned out to be avenacosidase, a β-glucosidase that is part of the defense system of *Avena sativa* (Gus-Mayer et al., 1994). Recently, several amino acid residues conserved among oat phytochrome A and bacterial histidine kinases were mutated without effect on the function of the photoreceptor (Boylan and Quail, 1996). This was taken as an argument against the phosphorylation activity associated with phytochrome preparations being intrinsic to the photoreceptor. However, the activity of higher plant phytochrome is of a serine rather than histidine kinase (Elich and Chory, 1997), such that the mutated amino acids may not be involved in the novel higher plant phytochrome-phosphorylating activity (Boylan and Quail, 1996). A strong argument in favor of the phytochrome-associated phosphorylating activity being intrinsic to the photoreceptor

protein is the fact that recombinant oat phyA, affinity-purified from *S. cerevisiae* cells to greater than 95% purity (Murphy and Lagarias, 1997), retained kinase activity similar to that of the photoreceptor purified from plants (Yeh and Lagarias, personal communication).

In view of this controversy, we felt it necessary to demonstrate a direct physical interaction between cryptochrome and phytochrome by independent means not subject to possible purification artifacts. The yeast two-hybrid interaction system demonstrated conclusively that CRY1 and phytochrome A do indeed interact physically (Figure 3B), and that yeast cells harboring both constructs accumulate β-galactosidase in a Gal4-dependent manner. Although significant, the level of interaction was not of high affinity. A stable complex between the two photoreceptors would therefore be unlikely to occur in vivo, ensuring that the degree of interaction/phosphorylation could be readily fine-tuned to the level of the light signal. It is also possible that the N-terminal chromophore-binding region of cryptochrome may contribute to the interaction with phytochrome. Thus, intact full-length photoreceptors may interact more strongly in the plant.

The C-terminal domain of phyA contains several regions essential for function. Deletion of one subdomain (aa 617–686) results in a photoactive dimer with no biological activity in transgenic plant assays (Wagner et al., 1996). Another phyA region (aa 680–840) appears to be a mutational hot spot (Xu et al., 1995). These regions of phytochrome contain two direct repeats representing putative dimerization motifs under blue light (Zhulin et al., 1997) that are also found in the photoactive yellow protein of the purple bacterium *Ectothiorhodospira halophila* (Baca et al., 1994), in *Mesotaenium caldariorum* phytochrome (Lagarias et al., 1995), and in white collar-1 and white collar-2 blue light-regulated transcription factors from *Neurospora crassa* (Ballario et al., 1996; Linden and Macino, 1997). These putative dimerization motifs also share similarity to the *Drosophila period* and *single-minded* loci and a subunit of the aromatic hydrocarbon receptor encoded by the *arnt* locus and are thereby designated as PAS (for *per*, *arnt*, and *sim*) (Huang et al., 1993). Only the larger of the two PHYA fragments included in this study (BD Phy 624–1100) contains both PAS domains, in addition to two flanking domains known to be involved in dimerization of phytochrome (Lagarias et al., 1995; Quail, 1997; Zhulin et al., 1997). Since only the larger of the two PHYA fragments showed interaction with CRY1 in the two-hybrid assay, it is possible that dimerization of phytochrome may be necessary for its interaction with substrate, and that both of the two putative PAS domains play a role in substrate interaction.

The challenge with interactions observed between signaling molecules in vitro is to establish their biological relevance in vivo. In this study, in vivo labeling experiments showed that the CRY1 photoreceptor is indeed phosphorylated in the plant, and that this phosphorylation is stimulated by red light in a manner consistent with the action of phytochrome in vitro. Analysis of the expression characteristics of mutant alleles of CRY1 demonstrated that some but not all alleles interfered with phytochrome responses. Moreover, the alleles that affected responsivity to red light were exclusively those

Figure 6. Model for Possible Mechanism of Interaction between the Photoreceptors

In the dark state, neither CRY1 nor phytochrome is activated, and CRY1 is in the unphosphorylated state. Following red light stimulation, phytochrome is activated and cryptochrome is phosphorylated by phytochrome-associated kinase activity. If the red light pulse is now followed by blue light, cryptochrome in the phosphorylated state is fully activated. If there was no prior red light pulse, cryptochrome is still activated by blue light, but the degree of activation is reduced (note that phytochrome absorbs in the blue as well as in red light, and some phosphorylation by phytochrome-associated kinase activity of cryptochrome would be expected to occur even in blue light). An additional prediction of the model is that the blue light signal is remembered by cryptochrome. This could occur if the signal results in a blue light-dependent conformational change, which persists for some time subsequent to the blue light pulse. Thus, if a red light signal is given subsequent to blue light, the activity of cryptochrome is enhanced (most likely by further stabilizing this active conformation).

subsequently to blue light pulses also affect responsiveness of CRY1. The likeliest explanation for this is that CRY1, like phytochrome, remembers the blue light signal and remains in the active form for some time subsequent to the light pulse. Thus, phosphorylation of an activated blue light receptor by phytochrome would enhance the effectiveness of the CRY1 receptor.

The functional interaction of phytochrome and cryptochrome represents an elegant mechanism of fine-tuning responsiveness to the light signal whereby phytochrome exerts control over an entirely distinct photosensory system. Our evidence suggests that one mechanism by which this can occur would be phytochrome-dependent phosphorylation of cryptochrome. Although in vivo labeling studies and allele-specific impairment of phytochrome function support the possibility that direct interaction of phytochrome and cryptochrome does indeed occur, further experiments will be necessary to conclusively demonstrate the in vivo relevance of our findings.

### Experimental Procedures

#### Protein Expression and Purification

Recombinant oat phytochrome A protein was a gift from J. Clark Lagarias (University of California) and was purified from *S. cerevisiae* as described (Murphy and Lagarias, 1997). Full-length recombinant CRY1 and CRY2 protein was expressed in baculovirus and purified as described (Lin et al., 1995). The C-terminal fragment of CRY1 was obtained by subcloning a fragment from nucleotides (nt) 1513–2044 (comprising aa 505–681 of CRY1) into the vector pET21a (Novagen). The construct contained a polyhistidine affinity tag at the C terminus. The C-terminal fragment of CRY2 was obtained by subcloning a fragment comprising aa 506–612 into the vector pET21a, likewise containing a polyhistidine affinity tag at the C terminus. Expressed proteins were purified from *E. coli* by nickel column affinity chromatography utilizing protocols recommended by the manufacturer (Novagen). The N-terminal fragment of CRY1 was obtained by subcloning a fragment from nt 1–1519 (aa 1–507) of CRY1 into the pET21 expression vector. This construct contains a polyhistidine tag at the C terminus. Expressed proteins were purified as above. Apparent molecular weights of the respective expressed purified proteins were 124 kDa (oat phyA); 80 kDa (full-length CRY1); 20 kDa (C-terminal fragment of CRY1); and 50 kDa (N-terminal fragment of CRY1). The C-terminal fragments of CRY1 protein harboring specific point mutations were obtained by PCR amplification of the region from nt 1513–2044 (aa 505–681) from genomic DNA prepared from the respective mutant plants (Ahmad et al., 1995). The DNA fragments were cloned into pET21 and recombinant proteins expressed and purified from *E. coli*. The C-terminal deletion mutant was constructed by PCR amplification of a C-terminal fragment comprising aa 505–619 of CRY1 and 628–681 of CRY1, followed by ligation and cloning into the pE 21 vector.

#### In Vitro Phosphorylation Reactions

Phosphorylation was assayed in 10 μl of reaction volume containing 25 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 5 mM MgCl₂, 0.2 mM EDTA, 5% (v/v) ethylene glycol, 10 μM ATP, and 10 μCi γATP (3000 Ci/mmol specific activity). Polylysine was added to a final concentration of 0.1 mg/ml unless otherwise indicated. Concentration of phytochrome was 0.01 μg/μl and concentration of other cofactors was as indicated in the figure legends. Phosphorylation reactions were carried out at 30°C for 30 min and terminated by addition of 3-fold excess of SDS sample buffer, followed by boiling for 10 min and electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gels. Gels were stained in Coomassie brilliant blue, destained extensively to remove unincorporated radioactive nucleotides, then dried and subjected to autoradiography. Quantitation of incorporated label was achieved where appropriate on a Molecular Dynamics model 425 PhosphorImager. All phosphorylation reactions were carried out on the benchtop in room light, except where otherwise indicated.

Yeast Two-Hybrid Expression and Cloning
In-frame fusions of PHYA and CRY1 genes were made to the GAL4 DNA binding domain or activation domain, respectively, using standard molecular biology techniques. C-terminal regions of PHYA (aa 624–1100 and 689–939) from *Arabidopsis* (Sharrock and Quail, 1989) were amplified by PCR, subcloned into the bait plasmid pAS1 (Durfee et al., 1993), and transformed into the yeast strain Y190. Trp prototrophic colonies were selected and assayed for activation of the transcription of the reporter gene as negative controls. C-terminal domains (aa 505–681) of wild-type and mutant versions (*hy-4 9*, *hy4-19*, and *hy-4 22*) of the CRY1 gene (M. A. et al., 1995) were amplified by PCR and subcloned into the two-hybrid shuttle/expression vector pACT (Durfee et al., 1993). Constructions were verified by DNA sequence analysis using specific primers for each vector.

Plasmids containing cDNA clones for PHYA and CRY1 sequences were pAS1 and pACT, respectively. These two-hybrid vectors have been described in detail elsewhere (Durfee et al., 1993). The reporter strain used was Y190 = MATa gal4 gal80 his3 trp1-901 ade2-101 ura3-52 leu2-3,-112⁺ URA::GAL→lacZ, LYS2::GAL→HIS3 cyhʳ (Durfee et al., 1993). The basic procedures for the yeast two-hybrid system used in this study are as described previously (Wade-Harper et al., 1993; Zhou et al., 1995).

Plasmids were introduced into yeast using a modification of the lithium acetate method. Yeast cells were grown in rich media, treated with lithium acetate, and incubated in the presence of the plasmid. The cells were then plated onto a minimal media that lacks the appropriate nutrients for plasmid selection. The resulting strains were checked for their activation properties and their ability to activate the lacZ reporter. The chimeric GAL4 AD-CRY1 fusion constructs were transformed into Y190 Trp prototrophic colonies harboring the chimeric fusions GAL4 BD-PHYA, and Leu and Trp prototrophic colonies were selected. The level of β-galactosidase expression was quantified using a colorimetric assay with chlorophenol red β-D-galactopyranoside (CPRG) as substrate, which results in greater sensitivity (Iwabuchi et al., 1993). Averages of β-galactosidase activities were determined on at least three colonies from each transformation. β-galactosidase activities were calculated using the equation:

Units of β-galactosidase activity = 1000 × OD₅₇₄/N × T × OD₆₀₀

In Vivo Labeling Procedure
Two-week-old transgenic *Arabidopsis* plants expressing recombinant CRY1 containing a polyhistidine tag (Lin et al., 1996a) were transferred to dark for 48 hr and then immersed into radioactive orthophosphate (concentration of 1 mCi/ml) and incubated for 4 hr in darkness. The tissue was divided into equal proportions (approximately 1 g of wet weight per sample) under green safelight and treated for 1 min with high-fluence red light (30 μmoles/m² per sec) or high-fluence red light given simultaneously with far-red light (fluence 100 μmol/m² per sec). Tissue was then immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, ground in a mortar containing ice-cold extraction buffer (50 mM Tris [pH 7.5], 500 mM NaCl, 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, 2.5 mM sodium fluoride, and 1 μg/ml Okadaic acid (Sigma) and protease inhibitor cocktail (cat# 1836170, Boehringer Mannheim). Homogenate was transferred to Eppendorf tubes, spun for 10 min at 4°C, and the supernatant transferred to a fresh tube together with nickel resin for affinity purification of histidine-tagged CRY1. Samples were incubated with the resin for 1 hr at 4°C and then washed as follows: 3 × 1 ml of washing buffer 1 (WB1) (same as extraction buffer); 3 × 1 ml of WB2 (50 mM Tris [pH 7.5], 300 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM sodium fluoride, and protease inhibitors); and 3 × 1 ml of WB3 (50 mM Tris [pH 7.5], 300 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM sodium fluoride, 10 mM imidazole, and protease inhibitors). SDS sample buffer (50 μl) was then added to the washed resin and the sample boiled for 10 min prior to electrophoresis on a polyacrylamide gel. Western blotting with anti-CRY1 antibody was carried out as described (Lin et al., 1996a).

Measurement of Phytochrome Responses
Seeds of the indicated genotypes were surface-sterilized and sown on MS agar plates containing 2% sucrose as described (Ahmad et al., 1995). After 2 days at 4°C, the plates were transferred to continuous red light (fluence 4 μmol/m² per sec) for 4 days prior to measurement of hypocotyl lengths. The time to flowering was measured for plants grown on soil under an 8 hr photoperiod at 22°C under white (Phillips Cool White) fluorescent bulbs.
