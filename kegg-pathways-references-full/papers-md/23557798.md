## ABSTRACT

Interleukin-17 (IL-17), the signature cytokine produced by T helper 17 (Th17) cells, plays pivotal roles in host defense responses against microbial invasion, as well as in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases and allergic syndromes. IL-17 activates several downstream signaling pathways including NF-κB, MAPKs and C/EBPs to induce gene expression of antibacterial peptides, proinflammatory chemokines and cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). IL-17 can also stabilize mRNAs of genes induced by TNFα. Although the physiological and pathological functions of IL-17 have been studied for many years, the landscape of its signaling transduction has not been described until recently. The cytosolic adaptor molecule Act1 (also known as CIKS) is considered as the master mediator of IL-17 signaling. In this review, we will summarize recent progress on activation and regulation of IL-17 mediated signal transduction, especially on Act1 mediated regulation of the signaling.

## 1. Introduction

Inflammation is the body’s immediate protective response to infection of pathogens, allergens, and toxic chemical stimulations or physical injuries. While acute inflammation usually results in short-term leukocytes infiltration, danger signal removing and eventually tissue repair [1], persistent and dysregulated inflammation will become a major stimulator in the development of many human chronic diseases, including autoimmune diseases, metabolic disorders and cancer [2–5].

Interleukin-17 (IL-17) family cytokines are a newly emerged subset of cytokines which participate in both acute and chronic inflammatory responses [6]. The fundamental member, IL-17 (also named IL-17A), is the most investigated cytokine in this family. Though it was originally considered as the representative cytokine released by Th17 (T helper 17) cells, recent studies show that a wide range of innate immune cells, including γδT cells, LTi cells, iNKT cells, NK cells and neutrophils, are also considerable sources of its early production [7,8]. Rapid secretion of IL-17 from those cells is necessary for early innate immune responses.

Since the discovery of it in 1993, the biological functions of IL-17 have been amply expanded. This unique cytokine plays critical roles in host defense against bacterial and fungal invasion, as well as in the pathogenesis of allergy, autoimmune diseases, obesity and tumor. Extensive studies have demonstrated that IL-17 exerts its inflammatory effects by inducing the expression of proinflammatory genes such as chemokines, cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) through NF-κB, MAPKs and C/EBPs signaling pathways [9]. IL-17 also has strong ability in promoting mRNA stabilization of some unstable genes induced by other stimulus such as TNFα [9]. TRAF6 is the first identified upstream signaling molecule required for IL-17-induced activation of NF-κB and JNK pathways. But the signaling framework was still obscure until the discovery of Act1 (an NF-kappaB activator 1; also known as CIKS, connection to IKK and SAPK/JNK) as the key mediator of IL-17 signaling. As a critical receptor proximal molecule in the activation of IL-17 signaling, Act1 action is shown to be tightly controlled by several mechanisms to prevent abnormal inflammation. The latest progress has proved that Act1 also participates in biological functions mediated by other IL-17 family cytokines. It is likely that Act1 functions as a common signal mediator among IL-17 family. In the present review, we will discuss the latest breakthroughs regarding the activation and regulation of IL-17 signaling.

## 2. The IL-17 family cytokines and their receptors

IL-17 family cytokines, which are characterized by the homology to the prototype member IL-17A (also called IL-17), are a subset of cytokines with diverse functions in the immune system. This family of cytokines contains six members, IL-17A, IL-17B, IL-17C, IL-17D, IL-17E (also named IL-25) and IL-17F (Fig. 1). The IL-17 family receptors, which consist of IL-17RA, IL-17RB, IL-17RC, IL-17RD and IL-17RE, are also identified by the typical structure homology among the members (Fig. 1). All receptor members contain a fibronectin III-like domain in their extracellular part and a SEF/IL-17R (SEFIR) domain in their intracellular region [10]. IL-17RA (also known as IL-17R) had been long considered as the

Fig. 1. Overview of IL-17 family cytokines and receptors. IL-17 family cytokines contain six members, IL-17A to IL-17F, while the receptor family consist of five members, IL-17RA to IL-17RE. IL-17A and IL-17F form homodimer or heterodimer to bind IL-17RA and IL-17RC heterodimeric complex and trigger downstream signaling for host defense and the inflammatory pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. Although the physical interaction of IL-17B and IL-17RB was observed, the biological functions of this pair are still largely unknown. IL-17C associates with IL-17RA and IL-17RE complex to activate downstream signaling for host defense and the inflammatory pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. IL-17E binds to IL-17RA and IL-17RB complex for signaling to mediate Th2 response. While IL-17RD was reported to modulate IL-17A induced signaling, whether it is a receptor for IL-17A still needs to be illustrated. The receptor for IL-17D has not been identified. Act1 has been identified as a key receptor binding molecule in IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-17C and IL-17E mediated signaling.

receptor of IL-17. However, newly emerged evidences suggest that IL-17RA is likely a common receptor used by IL-17 family cytokines. Other receptors including IL-17RB, IL-17RC and IL-17RE have been identified as specific receptors for IL-17E, IL-17A as well as IL-17F and IL-17C respectively. IL-17RD (also known as Sef), originally identified as a negative regulator in FGF signaling, has recently been found to regulate IL-17A signaling [11,12]. While the structural analysis has demonstrated a dimeric receptor constitution [13], the detailed receptor complex formation for a specific IL-17 cytokine could be more complicated than we thought.

In murine, IL-17F shares the highest amino acid homology to IL-17 (nearly 50%), while less identity to IL-17B, IL-17C and IL-17D [6]. The high similarity between IL-17 and IL-17F may explain the similar proinflammatory functions they mediate. Both cytokines can form homodimer or heterodimer with each other to bind to their receptor complex, IL-17RA and IL-17RC, and therefore to trigger the activation of NF-κB, MAPKs and C/EBPs cascades which eventually leads to the upregulation of proinflammatory genes [9]. IL-17 can also cooperate with TNFα to synergistically induce gene expression through regulation of mRNA stabilization [9]. Recently, we also found IL-17 can promote NF-κB activation by downregulating microRNA-23b expression in residential cells of inflammatory tissues [14].

Besides the similar signal transduction pathways mediated by IL-17 and IL-17F, the cellular sources of these two cytokines are also largely overlapped. Initially, IL-17 and IL-17F were believed to be predominantly expressed in the Th17 cells. Th17 cell differentiation program is tightly controlled by a set of cytokines, including TGFβ, IL-6, IL-1β, IL-23 and IL-21, and transcription factors which include RORγt, STAT3, RORα, IRF4, BATF, AHR, Runx1 and IkBξ [7,15]. In addition to Th17 cells, a subset of CD8⁺ T cells that also called Tc17 cells can also produce IL-17 and IL-17F. More recently, several innate immune cell populations have also been showed to produce IL-17 and IL-17F. These distinctive cell populations, including γδT cells, iNKT cells, NK cells, LTi cells and neutrophils are considered as the major sources of innate IL-17 and IL-17F. Non-lymphoid cells may also have the capability to secrete IL-17 or IL-17F. Studies have found that intestinal Paneth cells can express IL-17 and colonic epithelial cells produce IL-17F [6,8]. Given the role of these cells in host defense system, the rapid release of IL-17 or IL-17F may contribute to immediate immune responses against mucosal pathogens.

IL-17 has been shown to target various tissues under different inflammatory conditions and participate in the pathogenesis of multiple autoimmune diseases [16–23], allergic disorders [24,25], tumor formation [26–29] and host defense [24,30–32]. IL-17F, however, has a minor contribution to autoimmune and allergic diseases according to several animal disease model studies [17,24]. IL-17F is considered to play protective roles in host defense against infection [24]. The less important role of IL-17F than IL-17 in autoimmune and allergic diseases could be explained by the relative weaker activation ability of IL-17F to induce inflammatory genes [6,10,24,33].

IL-17E (also known as IL-25) functions extremely different from IL-17 and IL-17F. IL-17E is a Th2 response related cytokine and can promote Th2 cell immunity through induction of IL-4, IL-5 and
IL-13. IL-17E transgenic mice or mice treated with exogenous IL-17E showed an increase of Th2 cytokines along with eosinophilia [34–37]. In contrast, due to reduced Th2 response, IL-17E deficient mice were more susceptible to helminthes infection but were resistant to allergic challenge in lung [37–42]. Both immune cells (DCs, macrophages, T cells, mast cells, eosinophils and basophils) and non-immune cells (Paneth cells and epithelial cells) could become the sources of IL-17E under certain conditions. Like its producing cells, IL-17E responsive cells are also diverse, including Th2 cells, Th9 cells, NKT cells, macrophages, monocytes, non-B non-T cells (NBNT) cells and epithelial cells [6]. IL-17E is believed to activate downstream events through the IL-17RA and IL-17RB heterodimeric receptor complex [43]. The adaptor protein Act1 is also found to be the key transmitter in IL-17E signaling [44–46].

While biological functions of IL-17B and IL-17D are still not clear [9,47], recent studies have begun to discover the physiological and pathological roles of IL-17C. We and others demonstrated that IL-17C is the ligand for the orphan receptor IL-17RE [48–50]. IL-17C delivers its signal through IL-17RA and IL-17RE complex. IL-17C is specifically induced in epithelial cells and keratinocytes by pathogens or inflammatory cytokines. IL-17C acts in an autocrine manner on those target cells which highly express IL-17RE [48,49]. Similar to IL-17, IL-17C activates common signaling pathways including NF-κB and MAPKs (P38, JNK and ERK) to induce gene production of antibacterial peptides, inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. IL-17C also targets Th17 cells to promote IL-17 production [50]. *In vivo* functional studies demonstrated that the IL-17C–IL-17RE pathway is critical for protection against intestinal pathogens infection as well as the pathogenesis of several autoimmune diseases that include psoriasis, IBD and multiple sclerosis [48–50].

### 3. Activation of IL-17 signaling pathways

IL-17 was first cloned from an activated murine T lymphocyte hybridoma cDNA library [51]. Sooner after the realization of the proinflammatory property of this cytokine, the downstream signaling pathways were uncovered. IL-17 can upregulate the expression of a variety of proinflammatory chemokines and cytokines through activation of NF-κB, MAPKs and C/EBPs cascades [9]. IL-17 can also posttranscriptionally stabilize mRNAs induced by TNFα [9]. The synergic effect of IL-17 and TNFα on gene induction is also found at least partially regulated transcriptionally [52]. Other observations suggest that IL-17 can activate JAK–PI3K and JAK–STAT pathways. However, how IL-17 exactly contributes to the activation of these pathways is unclear [53,54]. IL-17 was initially found to bind to IL-17RA for downstream signaling [33]. IL-17RA deficient fibroblasts failed to respond to IL-17 or IL-17F stimulation [17]. Following studies showed that IL-17RC interacts with IL-17RA in an IL-17 signaling-dependent manner and it can also bind to IL-17 or IL-17F. IL-17RC deficient mice also failed to induce downstream gene expression in response to IL-17 or IL-17F [10,55]. Thus, upon ligand binding, IL-17RA and IL-17RC form a heterodimeric receptor complex to initiate downstream signaling events. The receptor proximal signaling events have been discovered recently (Fig. 2).

Tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR)-associated factor (TRAF) proteins, which consist of TRAF1 to TRAF6, play diverse roles in the immune signaling system [56]. TRAF6 is discovered to be essential for IL-17-induced activation of NF-κB and JNK pathways and consequently for IL-6 gene induction through analysis of TRAF6 deficient MEFs [57]. However, there is no predicted TRAF6 binding motif in IL-17RA and TRAF6 is shown not required for IL-17 induced mRNA stabilization, suggesting that other players downstream of IL-17RA likely exist for both TRAF6 dependent and independent pathways [58].

In 2003, the SEFIR domain was identified in all IL-17R family members through bioinformatic analysis. Interestingly, the SEFIR domain architecture was also found to exist in a cytosolic protein called Act1 (also known as CIKS) [59]. Indeed, Act1 is shown to be recruited to IL-17R through its SEFIR domain in an IL-17 stimulation dependent manner [60,61]. TRAF6 then binds to Act1, and therefore indirectly interacts with IL-17R complex. Act1 functions not only as an adaptor for the recruitment of TRAF6, but also as a U-box like E3 ligase, which ubiquitinates TRAF6 by utilizing the Ubc13–Uev1A E2 complex in a Lys63-linked non-degradative way. The U-box domain of Act1 is essential for IL-17 induced NF-κB activation. We recently found that both TAB2 and TAB3 associated with TRAF6 in an IL-17 dependent manner, and siRNA mediated gene silencing of TAK1 or TAB2 together with TAB3 suppressed IL-17-induced NF-κB activation but not MAPKs activation, indicating that the TAK1 complex (TAK1–TAB2–TAB3) is specifically required for IL-17-induced NF-κB activation [14]. In IL-1β or TNFα mediated signaling, K63-linked TRAF6 polyubiquitination associates with the TAK1 complex and activates the kinase TAK1, and subsequently leads to the IKK complex and classic NF-κB activation [62]. It remains to be determined if this is true for IL-17 signaling. We recently found that IL-17 downregulated miR-23b expression through NF-κB pathway [14]. MiR-23b was also shown to target TAB2 and TAB3 to suppress the proinflammatory cytokines (IL-17, TNFα and IL-1β) mediated signaling and downstream gene induction [14]. Thus, IL-17 activates NF-κB to remove the suppressor miR-23b for further NF-κB activation (Fig. 2). Since the SEFIR domains of both Act1 and IL-17R are important for their binding, a more refined domain mapping study showed that a CC’ loop in SEFIR domains of Act1 and IL-17R is responsible for Act1–IL-17R interaction. A cell-permeable decoy peptide mimicking the structure of CC’ loop of Act1 suppressed IL-17 or IL-17E induced inflammatory responses both *in vitro* and *in vivo* [63]. Similar strategies might offer new hope for prevention and treatment of IL-17 related autoimmune diseases in humans. Though the SEFIR domains of both Act1 and IL-17R are critical for signaling, other biochemistry studies delineated that, beside to SEFIR domain, the “TIR-like loop”(TILL) motif and C-terminal region of IL-17RA, the cytoplasmic tail region of IL-17RC or the N-terminal domain of Act1 are also required for IL-17 signaling [64–67]. These detailed domain analyses provided deeper insights of IL-17 signaling transduction and potential new therapeutic strategies for IL-17 driven diseases.

The IL-17-mediated mRNA stability of CXCL1 (KC) induced by TNFα requires Act1 but not TRAF6 [58], suggesting that Act1 mediates both TRAF6 dependent and TRAF6 independent pathways in IL-17R signaling. The inducible kinase IKKi (also named IKKε) was found to mediate the Act1 dependent and TRAF6 independent pathway. IKKi was shown to associate with Act1 in response to IL-17 treatment in mouse fibroblasts. IL-17 induced NF-κB activation was not much affected in IKKi deficient airway epithelial cells while IL-17 induced KC mRNA stabilization was almost abolished in those cells. Through the mass spectrometry analysis, Act1 was found to be phosphorylated directly by IKKi at Ser-311 upon IL-17 exposure. Mutation of this residue on Act1 led to an impaired mRNA stabilization of KC while it did not influence NF-κB activation pathway. Another study demonstrated that TRAF2, TRAF5 and alternative splicing factor (ASF or SF2) were also required for IL-17-induced mRNA stabilization of KC [68]. IL-17 induced the formation of Act1–TRAF5/TRAF2–ASF complex, preventing ASF from binding to KC mRNA for cleavage. The phosphorylation of Act1 at Ser-311 was actually shown to be required for its association with TRAF2–TRAF5 complex. Consistently IKKi deficiency also abolished the formation of Act1–TRAF2–TRAF5 complex without disrupting the interaction between TRAF6 and Act1, suggesting that phosphorylation of Act1 at Ser-311 is specific for the formation of mRNA

Fig. 2. The activation of IL-17 signaling. Upon the ligands binding to the IL-17RA and IL-17RC heterodimeric receptor complex, Act1 is recruited to the receptors. TRAF6 is then recruited to the receptor complex through Act1. Act1 functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase to poly-ubiquitinate TRAF6. Auto-polyubiquitinated TRAF6 then associates with the TAK1 complex (TAK1–TAB2–TAB3) to activate IKK complex for NF-κB activation. TRAF6 is also required for IL-17-induced JNK activation. IL-17-induced NF-κB signaling also suppresses the expression of miR-23b to release its suppression of its targets TAB2 and TAB3 for further NF-κB activation. Act1 is shown to be required for IL-17-mediated C/EBP activation. Act1 also mediates the TRAF6 independent but TRAF2 and TRAF5 dependent pathway for mRNA stabilization of genes. Normally SF2 is bound to mRNA to mediate its degradation. Upon IL-17 stimulation, SF2 is recruited to Act1/TRAF5/TRAF2 complex and mRNA is released and stabilized. The kinase IKKi mediates the association of Act1 with TRAF2 or TRAF5 through directly phosphorylating Act1 at Ser-311. HSP90 has been shown to interact with Act1 to mediate its downstream pathways in IL-17 signaling.

stabilization cascade [68,69]. More recently, through mass spectrometry analysis, Act1 is found to interact with the molecular chaperone hsp90 in a IL-17 signaling dependent manner [70]. Hsp90 inhibitors reduced Act1 association with other signaling molecules as well as Act1-mediated IL-17 signaling. Interestingly the D10N variant of Act1 which was reported to be associated with psoriasis [71–73] lost its ability to bind to hsp90 and failed to activate IL-17 signaling. Thus, Act1 serves as a receptor proximal anchor platform together with HSP90 for the initiation of two independent pathways activated by IL-17: (1) TRAF6 dependent cascade, and (2) IKKi–TRAF2–TRAF5 dependent cascade (Fig. 2).

### 4. Regulation of IL-17 signaling pathways

Since IL-17 has a broad role in driving inflammatory responses, the signaling of IL-17 should be under tight control to avoid persistent harmful inflammation. One report found that IL-17 triggered sequential C/EBPβ phosphorylation at Thr188 and Thr179 in its regulatory 2 domain by the kinases ERK and GSK-3β. The dual-phosphorylation of C/EBPβ inhibited the expression of proinflammatory genes induced by IL-17 [74]. While this represents the first report of negative control of IL-17 signaling, very recent studies have identified several key regulatory mechanisms of the IL-17R–Act1 axis (Fig. 3).

TRAF3 is an adaptor protein, commonly used by TLRs and RIG-I to mediate type I interferon production for antiviral responses [75–77]. It is also an important negative regulator for TNF family signaling, such as CD40 or BAFF signaling, through its control of non-canonical NF-κB activation [78–82]. We recently found that TRAF3 played a crucial negative regulatory role in IL-17 signaling. Overexpression of TRAF3 led to suppression of IL-17 mediated NF-κB and MAPKs activation and proinflammatory cytokine production, while knockdown of TRAF3 resulted in an exacerbated activation of NF-κB and MAPKs as well as induction of proinflammatory cytokines. Mechanically, TRAF3 binds to IL-17R directly and interferes with the signaling complex formation of IL-17R–Act1–TRAF6, thus compromises activity of IL-17 signaling. Genetic evidence also showed that TRAF3 controlled the expression of inflammatory genes induced by IL-17 in vivo and consequently suppressed the pathogenesis of the autoimmune disease EAE [83]. Thus, TRAF3 is a receptor proximal negative regulator of Act1 mediated signaling events in IL-17 signaling (Fig. 3).

Similar to TRAF3, TRAF4 was also reported to be a negative modulator in IL-17 signaling lately. TRAF4-deficient primary cells showed remarkable enhancement of IL-17 signaling and chemokine expression upon IL-17 treatment. TRAF4-deficient mice displayed an earlier onset of EAE when transferred with MOG35-55 specific Th17 cells. Instead of binding to IL-17R for reducing Act1 recruitment to the receptor, TRAF4 was shown to disrupt IL-17 signaling by competing with TRAF6 for the binding to Act1 [84]. Therefore, TRAF4 also serves as a negative regulator through interfering with the formation of positive signaling complex at a different level (Fig. 3).

Ubiquitin–proteasome mediated protein degradation pathway is a widely used strategy for signaling desensitization by eliminating key components of signaling [85]. We recently found that

Fig. 3. The negative regulation of IL-17 signaling. Once the IL-17 signaling is activated, several mechanisms are adopted to prevent over-activation of the signaling. Upon signaling activation, TRAF3 is recruited to IL-17 receptor (IL-17R) to interfere with the formation of the IL-17R–Act1–TRAF6 signaling complex, while TRAF4 interacts with Act1 to disrupt the formation of Act1–TRAF6 signaling complex. Although IKKi is required for IL-17 mediated mRNA stabilization by phosphorylating Act1 at Ser-311, IKKi and its related kinase TBK1 phosphorylate Act1 in three other Ser sites to suppress the association of Act1 with TRAF6 and downstream NF-κB activation. TRAF6 is required for the two kinases mediated phosphorylation of Act1 on these three sites indicating a negative feed-back loop. IL-17 also induces the sequential phosphorylation of C/EBPβ by ERK and GSK3β to suppress C/EBP activation. The ubiquitin-specific protease USP25 directly removes IL-17 induced ubiquitination of TRAF5 and TRAF6 to suppress IL-17-induced Act1 mediated signaling. During persistent IL-17 stimulation, Act1 is phosphorylated, ubiquitinated and degraded through SCF<sup>β-TrCP</sup> E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, resulting in desensitization of IL-17 signaling.

persistent stimulation of cells with IL-17 resulted in dramatic decrease of Act1 protein level without significant change of its mRNA level. Mechanically, IL-17 triggered the recruitment of Act1 to SCF<sup>β-TrCP-1/2</sup> E3 ubiquitin ligase complex which mediated the Lys 48-linked polyubiquitination and degradation of Act1, similar to the E3 complex mediated Lys48-linked polyubiquitination and degradation of the inhibitor of nuclear factor κBα (IkBα), suggesting the positive and negative signaling mechanisms of IL-17R are sequentially and tightly coordinated by the same degradation system [86]. The IL-17-induced Act1 degradation is also phosphorylation dependent as a general kinase inhibitor staurosporine suppressed Act1 phosphorylation, ubiquitination and degradation. The degradation of Act1 eventually led to the erasure of Act1 related positive signaling complex, and consequently desensitization of IL-17 signaling (Fig. 3).

As described above, IKKi was shown as a positive component phosphorylating Act1 at Ser-311 for IL-17 induced mRNA stabilization. We recently found that both IKKi and the other IKK-related kinase TBK1 were associated with Act1 in an IL-17 dependent manner. We also found IL-17 stimulation activated the two kinases. Interestingly, we further found that both kinases phosphorylated Act1 on three other Ser sites and Act1 phosphorylation on those sites decreased its interaction with TRAF6 and consequently suppressed NF-κB activation in IL-17 signaling. Surprisingly, TRAF6 but not TRAF3 was required for the activation of TBK1 and its association with Act1 after IL-17 stimulation [87]. We also observed both TRAF6 dependent and independent Act1 phosphorylation, consistent with the differential role of IKKi in regulating both TRAF6

dependent and independent IL-17R signaling through phosphorylating Act1 on differential Ser sites. Together, our findings demonstrate a crucial negative feed-back loop (Act1–TRAF6–the IKK related kinases–Act1) in IL-17R signaling (Fig. 3).

More recently, IL-17R signaling was shown negatively regulated by the ubiquitin-specific protease USP25, one subfamily member of deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) [88]. Similar to TRAF3, overexpression of USP25 led to a suppression of IL-17 triggered downstream signaling, while USP25 deficient MEFs or primary lung epithelial cells shown increased responses to IL-17 exposure. USP25 deficient mice also displayed elevated IL-17 induced inflammation in lung and exacerbated EAE pathology in central nervous system (CNS). As a DUB, USP25 directly removed IL-17 induced ubiquitination of TRAF5 and TRAF6 and consequently suppressed both TRAF6 dependent NF-κB activation and TRAF5 dependent but TRAF6 independent mRNA stabilization pathways in IL-17R signaling (Fig. 3).

5. Act1 in IL-17 associated autoimmune diseases

Before the realization of its essential role in IL-17-induced inflammatory responses, Act1 was found as a negative regulator of CD40 and BAFF signaling in B cells [89–92]. Act1 deficient mice showed increased B cell numbers and were accompanied with B cells related disorders. Moreover, those mice also had increased number of Th17 cells and developed autoimmune symptoms at an old age. However, these mice are protected from the pathological lesion of EAE, DSS induced colitis or collagen-induced arthritis

[61,93]. The resistant phenotype of Act1 deficient mice to EAE challenge is consistent with the positive function of Act1 in IL-17 signaling. Since the global depletion of Act1 causes multiple factors related immune disorders, analysis of cell type specific Act1 knockout mice is crucial to evaluate its role in the autoimmune pathogenesis more accurately. Further analyses indeed showed that mice with Act1 abolished in astrocytes, oligodendrocytes or neurons, rather than in endothelial cells, macrophages or microglia, exhibited delayed onset and reduced severity of the disease, suggesting that Act1 mediated IL-17 signaling in neuroectoderm-derived cells make a major contribution to EAE induced demyelination and axonal injury [94]. Global or astrocytes specific Act1 knockout mice were also resistant to cuprizone-induced demyelination, consistent with a crucial role of Act1 in EAE model [95]. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLEs) is also a systemic autoimmune disease. Latest study showed that IL-17 signaling and its downstream key adaptor Act1 were crucial for the disease progression in an FcgammaR2b-deficient mouse model of SLE. Compared with FcgammaR2b-deficient mice, IL-17 and FcgammaR2b or Act1 and FcgammaR2b double deficient mice were protected from development of lupus and shown remarkable improved survival rate [96]. Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of human patients with psoriasis or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) actually identified the existence of genetic mutations of Act1 in those patients, pointing to the critical role of Act1 in human autoimmune pathogenesis [71–73,97]. More recently, the psoriasis-associated Act1 mutant D10 N is reported to contribute to psoriasis pathogenesis by promoting Th17 response to increase IL-22 production in skin [70].

### 6. Act1 in other IL-17 cytokine family members mediated signaling

Since the architecture of SEFIR domain is a common feature of IL-17 receptor family members, it is very likely that Act1 may also be involved in other IL-17 cytokines mediated signaling. Though IL-17E has very distinct biologic functions from IL-17A and IL-17F, the effects of IL-17E are entirely dependent on the adaptor protein Act1. Act1 can be recruited to IL-17RB under IL-17E stimulation and the binding is also through the SEFIR–SEFIR interaction between the receptor and the adaptor [44,45]. IL-17E caused allergic pulmonary inflammation symptoms, such as Th2 cytokine production, mucus hypersecretion, eosinophils recruitment, and airway hyperreactivity, which were totally blocked by Act1 genetic ablation. Subsequent reports from cell type specific Act1 deficient mice shown that both epithelial and T cell-derived Act1 contributed to allergen-induced airway inflammation [45,98]. More recently, epithelial-derived Act1 was also reported to be crucial for IL-17E dependent parasite expulsion by expansion of Lin⁻c-Kit⁺ innate immune cells in intestine [46].

We and others found that IL-17RE is the specific receptor for IL-17C [48–50]. This newly defined pathway plays a central role in controlling autoimmunity and host defense responses. The cytoplasmic region of IL-17RE also bears the SEFIR domain, a potential for the recruitment of Act1. Our unpublished data suggested that Act1 can indeed bind to this receptor through the homotypic SEFIR interaction. Another study confirmed the biological function of this interaction by showing that the genetic deficiency of Act1 abolished IL-17C signaling in Th17 cells. Although likely, it still remains to be known whether Act1 is required for other physiological and pathological functions mediated by IL-17C.

### 7. Perspectives

Recent advances in uncovering the activation and regulation mechanisms of IL-17 signal transduction, coupled with largely expanded knowledge of its role in human diseases, provide great hope for the development of new therapeutic targets in the treatment of multiple inflammatory diseases. Although these studies clearly demonstrate that the cytosolic adaptor Act1 is involved as a master mediator in IL-17 cytokines mediated function, several key issues on the understanding of the family cytokines mediated signaling remain to be solved: (1) Do exist Act1 independent pathways in IL-17 signaling? (2) How does Act1 modulate other IL-17 family members mediated signaling? (3) In addition to specific receptor subunit, do exist specific downstream signaling molecules for the IL-17 cytokines to mediate differential biological functions? Better characterization of the IL-17 family cytokines mediated signaling and inflammatory responses will benefit for prevention and therapy of human inflammatory diseases.
