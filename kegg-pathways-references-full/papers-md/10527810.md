The Alzheimer disease-associated β-amyloid peptide has been shown to induce apoptotic neuronal death. In the present study, we test the hypothesis that the apoptotic pathway activated by β-amyloid is similar to the pathway activated by the Fas/TNFR family of death receptors, which requires caspase-8 activity and adaptor proteins such as FADD. We demonstrate that the selective caspase-8 inhibitor IETD-fmk blocks neuronal death induced by β-amyloid. Furthermore, using viral-mediated gene delivery, we show that neurons expressing dominant-negative FADD are protected from apoptosis induced by β-amyloid. Together these results indicate that the apoptotic pathway activated by β-amyloid requires both caspase-8 activity and FADD. These findings further support the hypothesis that β-amyloid might initiate apoptosis by cross-linking death receptors of the Fas/TNFR family.

## INTRODUCTION

β-Amyloid peptide (Aβ)² accumulates in plaques in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain. Aβ is toxic to cultured neurons (Barger *et al.*, 1995; Pike *et al.*, 1993), and transgenic mice in which Aβ is overexpressed show behavioral deficits and pathology reminiscent of AD (Chen *et al.*, 1998; Hsiao *et al.*, 1996). These findings have contributed to the prevailing view that Aβ deposition is important in the etiology of AD. Understanding how Aβ causes neuronal dysfunction and/or death, then, may be critical to clinical interventions to halt progression of the disease.

Neuronal death induced by Aβ displays characteristics of apoptosis, including plasma membrane blebbing, nuclear condensation, and DNA fragmentation (Loo *et al.*, 1993). Caspases, the effectors of apoptosis, are activated in neurons exposed to Aβ (Mattson *et al.*, 1998), and caspase inhibitors block Aβ-induced cell death (Mattson *et al.*, 1998). Because Aβ must aggregate to be toxic to neurons (Pike *et al.*, 1993), we have suggested that Aβ might cross-link cell surface proteins to generate intracellular signaling leading to the activation of an apoptotic program, in a type of activation-induced programmed cell death (APCD) similar to that triggered by Fas ligand (FasL) (Cotman *et al.*, 1996).

Apoptosis induced by FasL involves aggregation of its receptor Fas (APO1/CD95) and recruitment of the Fas-associated death-domain-containing protein FADD (Schulze-Osthoff *et al.*, 1998). Procaspace-8, recruited to receptor complexes by binding to the death effector domain of FADD, undergoes proteolysis and activation. Active caspase-8 then initiates a cascade of caspase activation leading to cell death. Expression of a dominant negative FADD mutant (dnFADD) blocks FasL-induced apoptosis (Chinnaiyan *et al.*, 1996b). Similarly, FasL-induced apoptosis is blocked by the expression of the viral serpin crmA (Srinivasula *et al.*, 1996; Tewari and Dixit, 1995), a caspase inhibitor whose physiological target is likely to be caspase-8 (Zhou *et al.*, 1997). We have recently demonstrated that crmA expression

inhibits Aβ-induced death of PC12 cells and hippocampal neurons (Ivins *et al.*, 1999), suggesting that the apoptotic pathway activated by Aβ may be similar to the pathway activated by FasL.

To test the hypothesis that Aβ activates a Fas-like apoptotic pathway, in the present study we evaluate the effects of inhibitors of Fas-induced apoptosis on apoptosis induced by Aβ. We demonstrate that the cell-permeable, selective caspase-8 inhibitor IETD-fmk blocks Aβ-induced apoptosis of cultured hippocampal neurons. Using viral-mediated gene transfer to express a dnFADD construct in these neurons, we show that expression of dnFADD also blocks Aβ-induced cell death. These results suggest that the apoptotic pathway activated by Aβ requires FADD and caspase-8 activity and support the hypothesis that Aβ induces APCD.

## METHODS

### Materials

Aβ<sub>1–42</sub> was purchased from Bachem or was synthesized and purified as described previously (Pike *et al.*, 1993) and provided by C. Glabe (University of California, Irvine, CA). A 1.25 mM stock Aβ solution was made in ddH<sub>2</sub>O and used after 1 week at 4°C. zIETD-fmk (Enzyme System Products) was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide at 20 mM. Staurosporine (Calbiochem) was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide at 1 mM. Concanavalin A (Con A) (Sigma type VI) was dissolved in medium. Caspase-8 antibody (Santa Cruz, sc-7890) was diluted 1:1000 in Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20, 1% BSA, and 3% normal goat serum for immunoblotting.

### Herpes Simplex Virus-1 Viral Vectors

A human dnFADD construct (NFD-4) was generously provided by V. M. Dixit (Genentech Inc., San Francisco, CA) (Chinnaiyan *et al.*, 1995, 1996b). The HSVpuc amplicon containing an internal ribosome entry site (IRES)-lacZ reporter cassette was described previously (Ivins *et al.*, 1999). The coding sequence of the dnFADD was subcloned upstream of the IRES to generate an amplicon (dnFADD-IRES-lacZ) directing expression of a bicistronic mRNA. The IRES-lacZ amplicon was used as a control. Amplicons were packaged as described previously, using replication-incompetent 5dl 1.2 helper virus and Vero-cell-derived 2–2 cells (Lim *et al.*, 1996). Viral vectors were purified through sucrose gradient centrifugation and titered on PC12 cells as described (Lim *et al.*, 1996).

### Hippocampal Neuron Cultures

Dissociated cultures of hippocampal neurons were prepared from E18 rat embryos and cultured in serum-free medium as described previously (Ivins *et al.*, 1998).

### Toxicity Assays

For experiments using caspase inhibitors, hippocampal neurons were plated at 50,000 cells/well in 48-well cluster dishes coated with poly-D-lysine. After 3 days of culture, cells were pretreated with 20μM IETD-fmk or vehicle for 2 h, then Aβ, Con A, staurosporine, or vehicle was added, and 24 h later cells were fixed by underlay with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Nuclei were stained with 2.5μg/ml bisbenzamide (Hoechst 33258). Cells were visualized by phase and epifluorescence microscopy, and cell survival was determined by counting the number of cells with nonapoptotic nuclei (large, nonfragmented nuclei containing evenly stained chromatin) in 3 or 4 fields per well. For experiments using virally infected cells, neurons were plated in medium containing 0.1% crystalline BSA (ICN) at 75,000 cells/well in 48-well cluster dishes coated with poly-D-lysine. Neurons were infected with dnFADD-IRES-lacZ or IRES-lacZ vectors at a multiplicity of infection of 0.01 to 0.1 after 2 days in culture. Drugs were added to cells the following day, and 24 h later cells were fixed by underlay with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Cells were processed for β-gal immunoreactivity using 40–1a anti-β-galactosidase (developed by J. Sanes and obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank maintained by the University of Iowa Department of Biological Sciences under Contract NO1-HD-7–3263 from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, National Institutes of Health) and cy2-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson Laboratories) as described previously (Ivins *et al.*, 1999); nuclei were stained with 2.5μg/ml bisbenzamide. Stained cells were visualized by epifluorescence microscopy and cell survival was determined by counting the number of immunoreactive cells with nonapoptotic nuclei in 12 fields per well.

## RESULTS

We have previously demonstrated (Ivins *et al.*, 1999) that expression of crmA in hippocampal neurons
blocks Aβ-induced apoptosis and decreases the susceptibility of the neurons to Con A, a lectin which promotes neuronal apoptosis through cross-linking cell surface receptors (Cribbs *et al.*, 1996). Because the physiological target of crmA is likely to be caspase-8 (Zhou *et al.*, 1997), these results suggested that the apoptotic pathway activated by Aβ in cultured neurons and the apoptotic pathway activated by FasL and TNF may share a requirement for caspase-8 activity. Indeed, we have found low but detectable levels of procaspase-8 immunoreactivity in neuronal cultures ± 25 μM Aβ (Fig. 1). Recently peptide-based cell-permeable caspase inhibitors have become available and have been used to discern the involvement of specific caspase activities in apoptotic pathways (Gagli and Bondurant, 1999; Hirata *et al.*, 1998; Stefanis *et al.*, 1998). One of these compounds, IETD-fmk, selectively inhibits caspase-8 and possibly caspase-10 activity (Garcia-Calvo *et al.*, 1998) and blocks cell death caused by Fas ligation (Kobayashi *et al.*, 1999). To determine whether the apoptotic pathway activated by Aβ in neurons requires caspase-8 activity, we have investigated the ability of IETD-fmk to block the apoptotic death of hippocampal neurons exposed to Aβ.

Pretreatment of cultured hippocampal neurons for 2 h with 20μM IETD-fmk protected neurons from Aβ-induced degeneration (Fig. 2). Early degenerative effects of Aβ on neurons include neurite beading and fragmentation, followed by evidence of DNA damage, nuclear chromatin condensation, and nuclear fragmentation (Ivins *et al.*, 1998; Paradis *et al.*, 1996). All of these

effects of Aβ were blocked by pretreatment with IETD-fmk (Figs. 2e and 2f), indicating that caspase-8 activity is required for Aβ toxicity. Because neurite degeneration is evident soon after neurons are exposed to many insults that result in neuronal death (Ivins *et al.*, 1998), these results also suggest that caspase-8 may be the initiator caspase involved in the apoptotic pathway activated by Aβ.

The ability of IETD-fmk pretreatment to promote neuronal survival after exposure to insults was quantified (Fig. 3). Neuronal death induced by Aβ was prevented by pretreatment with IETD-fmk, and death induced by Con A was significantly inhibited by IETD-fmk. In contrast, IETD-fmk had no effect on death induced by staurosporine, an apoptotic inducer that uses caspase-9 as an initiator caspase (Sun *et al.*, 1999). These results are consistent with our previous finding that crmA expression inhibits Aβ- and Con A-induced neuronal death (Ivins *et al.*, 1999).

Caspase-8 is the initiator caspase in apoptosis activated by ligands of the Fas/TNF family of death-domain-containing receptors (Darnay and Aggarwal, 1997; Muzio *et al.*, 1996). Adaptor proteins including FADD recruit procaspase-8 to these activated receptors, leading to its proteolysis and activation, and beginning the cascade of caspase activity required for apoptotic cell death. We hypothesized that because caspase-8 is critical in Aβ toxicity, a death-domain-containing protein such as FADD might also be involved in the apoptotic pathway activated by Aβ. To investigate the involvement of FADD in Aβ-induced neuronal death, we used viral-mediated gene delivery to introduce a dnFADD construct into hippocampal neurons.

Cultured hippocampal neurons infected with dnFADD-IRES-lacZ or IRES-lacZ viral vectors were identified by immunohistochemistry against β-galactosidase (Figs. 4a, 4c, 4e, and 4g). Cell viability was determined by the nuclear morphology of cells stained with bisbenzamide (Figs. 4b, 4d, 4f, and 4h). Neurons infected with the IRES-lacZ vector were as susceptible to apoptotic death as neurons in noninfected cultures (Ivins *et al.*, 1999; and data not shown). However, neurons infected with the dnFADD-IRES-lacZ vector were protected from death induced by Aβ, suggesting that FADD or a related protein is involved in the apoptotic pathway activated in neurons by Aβ (Fig. 5). Interestingly, dnFADD-IRES-lacZ expression did not confer neuronal resistance to apoptosis induced by Con A (Fig. 5).

Together these results suggest a proposed model for the induction of apoptosis by Aβ in which Aβ cross-

links cell surface receptors, causing recruitment of FADD or a related death-domain-containing protein and activation of caspase-8, initiating the apoptotic pathway (Fig. 6).

## DISCUSSION

Although the morphological characteristics of apoptotic cell death are well known, the biochemical pathways used for the induction and execution of apoptosis continue to be the subject of many investigations. At least two pathways of induction of apoptosis have been described. In the pathway activated by chemical inducers of apoptosis, such as the kinase inhibitor staurosporine and the DNA damaging agent etoposide, mitochondrial cytochrome c release has a pivotal role in binding Apaf-1 and causing caspase-9 activation, leading to the cascade of caspase activation that executes the death program (Kluck et al., 1997; Li et al., 1997; Slee et al., 1999). Antiapoptotic members of the bcl-2 family are very effective in blocking this pathway of cell death (Chinnaiyan et al., 1996a; Jacobsen et al., 1996). In contrast, caspase-8 activation occurs prior to cytochrome c release in the apoptotic pathway activated by cell surface death receptors such as Fas and TNFR1 (Sun et al., 1999), and overexpression of bcl-2 that prevents the release of cytochrome c is not sufficient to block this type of cell death (Gross et al., 1999). The mode of induction of apoptosis therefore may be critical to the ability of various interventions to prevent cell death.

The two pathways of induction of apoptosis can also be discerned by their susceptibility to inhibition by various caspase inhibitors. We have previously demonstrated that crmA expression blocks Aβ toxicity in primary cultures of hippocampal neurons, suggesting that caspase-8 inhibition might block the apoptotic pathway activated by Aβ (Ivins et al., 1999). Our results here using the selective caspase-8 inhibitor IETD-fmk (Garcia-Calvo et al., 1998) support this conclusion and suggest that caspase-8 is likely to be the initiator caspase in Aβ-induced apoptosis. Given the critical role of caspase-8 in the apoptotic pathway activated by cell surface death receptors such as Fas and TNFR1, these results suggest that APCD may be produced when Aβ cross-links cell surface receptors that actively promote cell death.

The Fas/TNFR superfamily of cell surface death receptors includes two TNF receptors, Fas, DR3, DR6, two TRAIL receptors, CAR-1, the low-affinity neurotrophin receptor p75<sup>NTR</sup>, and lymphoid cell-specific receptors CD30, CD40, and CD27 (Frade et al., 1996; Grell et al., 1999; Pan et al., 1997). Each of these transmembrane receptors contains a 40-amino-acid

FIG. 6. Proposed pathway of apoptotic death activated by Aβ in hippocampal neurons. Chemical and receptor-mediated inducers of apoptosis activate distinct apoptotic pathways (adapted from Tewari & Dixit, 1995). In the pathway activated by chemicals such as staurosporine, cytochrome c is released from mitochondria, causing proteolysis and activation of the initiator caspase procaspase-9. In contrast, in the apoptotic pathway activated by ligands at receptors including Fas and TNFR1, proteolysis and activation of procaspase-8 occur prior to mitochondrial release of cytochrome c. The present findings that IETD-fmk and dnFADD are protective against Aβ-induced cell death support the hypothesis that Aβ activates a receptor-mediated death pathway.

cysteine-rich sequence that occurs two to six times in the extracellular domain. Furthermore, several of these receptors contain a region of weak homology, referred to as the death domain, in the intracellular domain (Hofmann & Tschopp, 1995). Cytosolic death-domain-containing proteins including FADD, TRADD, RIP, and RAIDD serve as adaptor proteins, binding to this region of the receptors and recruiting procaspases as well as activators of intracellular signaling proteins, such as the stress-activated protein kinases and the transcription factor NF-κB (Cheema et al., 1999). Recruitment and activation of procaspase-8 by FADD has been shown to be required for apoptosis induced by Fas ligation (Medema et al., 1997), and there is evidence that apoptosis produced by death receptor/FADD/caspase-8 complexes is necessary for normal development. For example, FADD-deficient fibroblasts from mice with targeted disruption of the FADD gene are protected from death-receptor-activated cell death, and these mice die by embryonic day 11.5 (Sanchez et al., 1999). Similarly, knockout of the caspase-8 gene prevents cell death activated by Fas and TNF receptors, and this mutation is also lethal (Martin-Villalba et al., 1999).

The death receptor pathway of apoptosis may also have an important role in physiological and/or pathological neuronal death. Neuronal expression of Fas has been demonstrated in the mouse hippocampus (Park *et al.*, 1998). Furthermore, cortical neurons have been shown to be sensitive to the death ligands FasL, TNFα, and TRAIL (Martin-Villalba *et al.*, 1999), and ischemia-induced neuronal death may involve these death-inducing ligands and their receptors (Martin-Villalba *et al.*, 1999). Although it has been reported that FADD is not detectable in postnatal rat cerebral cortex (Cheema *et al.*, 1999), we have detected a band of approximately 30 kDa, consistent with the expected size of FADD, in immunoblots of lysates of adult human hippocampus (K. J. Ivins, data not shown). It is possible that FADD is expressed in hippocampus but not cortex; alternatively, the lack of detectable FADD immunoreactivity in postnatal rat cerebral cortex may be related to the species specificity of the antibody used.

We demonstrated a possible role for FADD in Aβ-induced apoptosis by showing that expression of a dnFADD construct blocked Aβ-induced apoptosis. This dnFADD construct contains the death domain of FADD, allowing its interaction with Fas and TNFR, but lacks the death effector domain responsible for recruitment of caspase-8 (Chinnaiyan *et al.*, 1995). Therefore, it seems likely that the construct might also block the function of other death-domain-containing proteins. However, although IETD-fmk inhibited apoptosis induced by Con A, the dnFADD construct had no effect on the cell death pathway activated by Con A. These results indicate that dnFADD expression does not nonspecifically block all APCD and further suggest that receptors cross-linked by Con A may use adaptor proteins other than FADD to recruit and activate caspase-8.

Together with our previous data suggesting that crmA inhibits Aβ-induced cell death (Ivins *et al.*, 1999), this study suggests that Aβ exerts its effects on neuronal death through a Fas-like pathway. Of course, under other culture conditions, different mechanisms including increased oxidative stress and increased calcium levels which might be involved.

What receptor(s) might Aβ cross-link to activate an apoptotic program? One candidate is the low-affinity neurotrophin receptor p75<sup>NTR</sup>, which has been suggested to potentiate or mediate the toxic action of Aβ on neurons (Rabizadeh *et al.*, 1994; Yaar *et al.*, 1997). p75<sup>NTR</sup> is a member the Fas/TNF superfamily of death receptors, and the intracellular domain of p75<sup>NTR</sup> contains a region with homology to the death domain

of Fas and TNFR1 (Chapman, 1995). NMR analysis has recently confirmed the existence of a death domain in p75<sup>NTR</sup> (Liepinsh *et al.*, 1997). In some cellular environments expression of p75<sup>NTR</sup> promotes cell death (Bamji *et al.*, 1998; Frade *et al.*, 1996; Rabizadeh *et al.*, 1993), and p75<sup>NTR</sup> has a physiological role in naturally occurring developmental neuronal death (Bamji *et al.*, 1998). Moreover, transgenic mice expressing the intracellular domain of p75<sup>NTR</sup> in neurons demonstrate losses in some neuronal populations and increased motor neuron death after axotomy, suggesting that the intracellular domain of p75<sup>NTR</sup> may constitutively activate signaling pathways that regulate apoptosis in neurons (Majdan *et al.*, 1997). Recently, TRAF6, one of the TNF receptor-associated factors, was shown to associate with p75<sup>NTR</sup> when receptors were bound with nerve growth factor (Khursigara *et al.*, 1999), and it was proposed that different adaptor proteins may be recruited to p75<sup>NTR</sup> bound by other neurotrophins (Khursigara *et al.*, 1999). In fact, our results would suggest that the binding of Aβ to p75<sup>NTR</sup> or to other death receptor(s) may lead to the recruitment of FADD.

In contrast to the direct activation of an apoptotic pathway by Fas/FADD/procaspase-8 complexes, members of the Fas/TNFR receptor family that lack a death domain (including CD40 and TNFR2) can cause cell death indirectly by promoting cellular signaling leading to death ligand release (Grell *et al.*, 1999). This raises the possibility that even if Aβ toxicity were mediated through a Fas/TNF family member, it could result from cellular signaling and death ligand release, rather than directly from receptor cross-linking. However, we have previously demonstrated that Aβ applied locally to neurites of cultured hippocampal neurons causes spatially restricted neurite degeneration (Ivins *et al.*, 1998). If Aβ toxicity is mediated through a signaling mechanism that involves the release of death ligands, then the death ligands must be released locally and bind back to neurons only in the vicinity of Aβ, a possibility that seems unlikely.

The apoptotic pathway activated in neurons by Aβ may also be activated by other environmental or genetic insults. Neurodegenerative diseases caused by an expansion mutation in the trinucleotide CAG encoding glutamine have been shown to be associated with intraneuronal polyglutamine aggregates and neuronal apoptosis (Ross *et al.*, 1998). Recently Sanchez *et al.* (1999) demonstrated that these polyglutamine inclusions cause caspase-8-dependent death of neurons, which can be inhibited by expression of dnFADD. Apparently then, polyglutamine inclusions also activate a Fas-like apoptotic pathway. It is likely that
intracellular aggregates of polyglutamine cause the recruitment, aggregation, and activation of caspase-8, initiating the apoptotic pathway. These results, along with those shown here, suggest that inhibition of caspase-8 might be particularly effective in blocking neuronal death occurring in age-related neurodegenerative diseases.
