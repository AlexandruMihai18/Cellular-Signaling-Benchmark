Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is an unique subtype of acute myeloid leukemia typically carrying a specific reciprocal chromosome translocation t(15;17) leading to the expression of a leukemia-generating fusion protein, PML-RARα. Nearly all *de novo* APL patients undergo disease remission when treated with all trans retinoic acid (ATRA) plus chemotherapy. APL patients that relapse following this type of therapy respond to As₂O₃ with disease remission once again. The mechanism of action of both ATRA and As₂O₃ appears to be by inducing granulocytic differentiation and this cellular differentiation seems to depend on PML-RARα proteolysis. ATRA treatment results in partial cleavage and complete degradation of PML-RARα protein in differentiation sensitive, but not in differentiation resistant APL cells. As₂O₃ treatment results in only complete degradation of PML-RARα protein in both ATRA-sensitive and -resistant APL cells. PML-RARα appears to cause leukemia by acting as a transcriptional repressor of RARα target genes and by inhibiting activity of transcription factor C/EBPα. Therefore, PML-RARα proteolysis induced by ATRA and As₂O₃ may play an important role in overcoming the repressive activity of PML-RARα and allowing cellular differentiation to proceed. This review will focus on the status of the PML-RARα fusion protein and its relationship to gene and differentiation induction as well as differentiation resistance of APL cells.

INTRODUCTION  

Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) accounts for approximately 10% of acute myeloid leukemia cases [1, 2]. Molecular studies have revealed that most APL cases are characterized by a t(15;17) translocation that fuses the PML gene on chromosome 15 to the retinoic acid receptor α (RARα) gene on chromosome 17, resulting in the formation of the PML-RARα fusion protein. In addition to the PML-RARα fusion protein, PLZF-RARα, NPM-RARα, NuMA-RARα and STAT5b-RARα fusion proteins also have been reported in some APL patients [3–6]. Transgenic mouse studies have shown that these fusion proteins are leukemogenic [7–11]. PML-RARα occurs in most APL patients and, therefore, is the best characterized of these fusion proteins. Comparison of the cDNA structures obtained from leukemia blasts of t(15;17) APL patients shows variation in the length of the PML sequence present in the fusion protein while the RARα portion is constant. The RARα sequence contains the B-F domains of RARα and thus includes the DNA-binding and ligand-binding motifs (Fig. 1) [1, 2, 12–15]. In APL cells, RARα, PML, and PML-RARα are expressed, but amount of PML-RARα protein is present in great excess over that of wild-type RARα protein, and therefore it is the predominant retinoid receptor in these cells [14, 16]. PML-RARα binds to retinoic acid response elements (RAREs) of DNA as a heterodimer with RXR or a homodimer and recruits corepressors SMRT and N-CoR it binds these repressors more tightly than does wild type RARα, such that physiological levels of all trans retinoic acid (ATRA) are not sufficient to release these co-repressors from PML-RARα protein [17–25]. Based on these findings it has been suggested that recruitment of corepressors SMRT/N-CoR with subsequent repression of ATRA target genes is critical for the oncogenic function of PML-RARα (see reviews in [23, 26, 27]). This communication will focus on the status of the PML-RARα fusion protein and its relationship to gene and differentiation induction as well as differentiation resistance of APL cells after ATRA and/or As₂O₃ treatment.

TREATMENT MODALITIES IN APL

Intensive cytoreductive chemotherapy, usually combining an anthracycline and cytosine arabinoside (araC), was the standard of treatment for APL until 1990 [28, 29]. The anthracycline-araC combinations yielded complete remission rates (CR) of 50% to 60% in APL patients. Since then, the novel discovery that ATRA induces APL cell differentiation has modified the therapeutic approach to APL [30–35]. Complete disease remission was induced by ATRA treatment in 90% of newly diagnosed or first-relapse patients with t(15;17). However, relapse occurred within months in patients that were initially sensitive to ATRA, therefore, chemotherapy was added to ATRA therapy. The combination of ATRA with chemotherapy reportedly cured more than 70% of APL patients with the t(15;17) translocation [30, 35, 36]. However, some APL patients experienced relapse that was resistant to further treatment with ATRA plus chemotherapy. These patients frequently responded to subsequent As₂O₃ treatment with a complete cure [37–43]. Although the mechanisms of action of both ATRA and As₂O₃ in APL are still not understood completely, since APL patients with the presence of the PML-RARα fusion protein respond clinically to both ATRA and As₂O₃ treatment, and since both agents induce PML-RARα proteolysis in APL cells (see below), it appears that PML-RARα may be the target of both ATRA and As₂O₃ therapy [35, 40, 41, 44–47].

ATRA INDUCES REMISSION OF APL BY INDUCING DIFFERENTIATION

ATRA treatment is characterized primarily by the induction of cellular differentiation rather than by cytotoxicity. ATRA induces APL blasts to undergo differentiation to the neutrophil stage leading to progressive replacement of malignant leukocytes by normal ones. It has been reported that a pharmacological concentration of ATRA (10⁻⁶M), but not a physiological one (10⁻⁹M), induced APL cells to undergo granulocytic differentiation [1, 2, 48]. Based on studies in NB4 cells, a cell line derived from an APL patient, several pathways have been implicated in ATRA-induced cell differentiation.

Overcoming PML-RARα Transcriptional Repression

It has been shown that PML-RARα binds to the nuclear receptor co-repressors SMRT and N-CoR with higher affinity than wild type RARα such that a pharmacological concentration of ATRA is required to release these co-repressors from in vitro-translated PML-RARα [19–25]. This observation suggests that pharmacological, but not physiological, levels of ATRA act by overcoming PML-RARα-mediated transcriptional repression and thereby inducing ATRA target gene expression in APL cells [11, 49–52]. In support of this suggestion, gene profiles that have been generated by several groups using differential display and DNA microarray assays show that the transcription factor, C/EBPε, is induced by ATRA in ATRA-sensitive NB4 cells, but not in ATRA-resistant APL cells [48, 53–58]. Since a RARE sequence is present in the promoter of C/EBPε, the induced expression of C/EBPε probably results from the ability of a pharmacological concentration of ATRA to overcome PML-RARα transcriptional repression at this RARE [58]. The observation that murine hematopoietic LG and 32Dcl3 cells and human leukemia U937 cells stably transfected with C/EBPε undergo granulocytic differentiation, suggests that this transcription factor plays an important role in ATRA-induced differentiation [58–60]. However, none of the cells used for C/EBPε ectopic transfection contain the PML-RARα fusion protein, thus these models may not reflect the true process of ATRA-induced differentiation in APL cells. Ectopic expression of C/EBPε by stable transfection in APL cells isolated from PML-RARα transgenic mice only drives partial differentiation, suggesting that C/EBPε may not be the sole factor to trigger APL cell differentiation after ATRA treatment [61]. The activities of other gene products, such as C/EBPβ and Bfl-1/A1, which are also induced by ATRA, may also contribute to ATRA-induced APL cell differentiation [48, 54, 62].

PML-RARα Proteolysis Due to ATRA Treatment

In vitro studies have shown that proteolysis of PML-RARα accompanies ATRA-induced cell differentiation. These observations provide another potential explanation for the ATRA induction of APL cell differentiation, i.e., ATRA may overcome PML-RARα transcriptional repression by inducing proteolysis of PML-RARα protein [44, 63–66]. Several groups have found that PML-RARα protein was completely degraded after ATRA treatment, however, we and other groups have found that PML-RARα was cleaved into a ~85 kD truncated product, termed ΔPML-RARα [44, 48, 64, 67–72]. Since ΔPML-RARα formation is not commensurate with the decrease of full-length PML-RARα, thus complete degradation may occur simultaneously upon treatment with pharmacological levels of ATRA [73].

Since ATRA initiates PML-RARα proteolysis after only 12 h of treatment, it is conceivable that this event rather than co-repressor release (see above) might be the key step whereby ATRA treatment overcomes the block of PML-RARα to differentiation in APL cells [64, 67]. The activity of C/EBPα (an important transcription factor for normal granulocytic cell differentiation) which has been found to be directly inhibited by binding to PML-RARα protein, therefore, PML-RARα proteolysis, in addition to overcoming transcriptional repression, may also restore the activity of C/EBPα [74–76]. Thus PML-RARα proteolysis appears to be important for ATRA induction of APL cell differentiation. However, several ATRA-resistant NB4 subclones that no longer contain PML-RARα protein and NB4 cells treated with As₂O₃ with subsequent degradation of PML-RARα protein did not undergo differentiation [48, 77–79]. Therefore PML-RARα proteolysis alone is insufficient to trigger APL cell differentiation.

A Positive Signal from PML-RARα Contributes to ATRA-induced Differentiation

PML-RARα-transfected U937/PR9 cells are more sensitive to differentiation induction with pharmacological concentrations of ATRA than the parent U937 cells, suggesting that PML-RARα, in addition to functioning as a transcriptional repressor, might play a positive role in ATRA-induced cell differentiation [80]. In addition, NB4 variants (NB4.306, NB4/R2 and NB4.007/6) that express low levels of PML-RARα protein are resistant, or only partially, responsive to ATRA-mediated differentiation [77, 78, 81]. C/EBPε expression is strongly induced by ATRA in U937/PR9 cells and is not, or only weakly, induced in NB4 variants deficient in the PML-RARα protein. Thus PML-RARα may function like RARα to transactivate gene expression (although only at pharmacological concentrations of ATRA) [58]. The reason for both the apparent requirement of PML-RARα proteolysis and the presence of PML-RARα protein for ATRA-induced differentiation has not been solved. The proteo-

lysis product, ΔPML-RARα, formed after treatment with pharmacological concentrations of ATRA, may play a role. ΔPML-RARα is recognized by an antibody raised against the C-terminal region of RARα, suggesting that the N-terminal end of the PML moiety in PML-RARα is deleted in this fusion protein [48, 73]. Based on its apparent size (~85 kD), ΔPML-RARα is likely to lack the RING finger and part of B-Boxes of the PML moiety (Fig. 1). If so, the protein-binding RING finger domain would be deleted from PML-RARα protein [82, 83]. It is possible that the inhibition by PML-RARα of C/EBPα activity is mediated through the RING finger domain. Moreover, since the truncated ΔPML-RARα protein still contains the functional RARα moiety, it may function in a fashion similar to that of the wild type RARα, i.e., to activate ATRA target genes such as C/EBPε. This is supported by the finding that hexamethylene bisacetamide (HMBA) enhances both ATRA-induced ΔPML-RARα formation and C/EBPε expression as well as ATRA-induced differentiation in NB4 cells [84].

Based on published data, pathways of ATRA-induced differentiation in APL cells could be diagrammed as shown in Fig. 2.

occurs in some ATRA-treated patients. It has been assumed that an increase in ATRA catabolism might cause ATRA resistance in these APL patients [85]. However, ATRA resistance is also correlated with the status of the PML-RARα protein, i.e., resistant APL cells either have mutated PML-RARα, have lost PML-RARα protein expression, or fail to induce PML-RARα protein proteolysis (Table 1) [86].

Mutations of PML-RARα in Ligand Binding E Domain

Among the ATRA-resistant subclones derived from APL cells, missense mutations in the ligand binding E domain of PML-RARα were found in UF-1 cells established from an ATRA-resistant APL patient and in four NB4 subclones [87–91]. Moreover, similar mutations have been found in a few APL patients' cells following relapse from ATRA treatment (3 in 23 ATRA treated patients in one group; 3in12ATRA treated patients in another group) [92, 93]. These in vitro and in vivo findings suggest that mutations in the ligand binding domain of the PML-RARα is one mechanism by which patients may acquire resistance to ATRA therapy. It is possible that mutated PML-RARα cannot bind ATRA, may fail to undergo proteolysis, and/or may fail to induce ATRA target gene expression. The lack of any one or more of these capabilities may lead to differentiation resistance.

Loss of PML-RARα Protein

Since several NB4 variants (NB4.306, NB4/R2, NB4.007/6, NB4-R1 and NB4-R3; Table I) that express low levels of PML-RARα protein are resistant to differentiation induction by ATRA treatment. PML-RARα stable transfection in NB4.007/6 cells restored

ATRA sensitivity, suggesting that positive signaling due to PML-RARα may be lacking in these cells after the loss of PML-RARα protein [94]. Studies with the NB4 variant resistant to arsenic-induced cell death, NB4/As, also support this hypothesis [73]. In the presence of As₂O₃, PML-RARα protein was degraded rapidly and these cells were insensitive to ATRA differentiation induction. However, when arsenic was removed from the culture medium the level of PML-RARα protein in these cells returned to its original levels and they became ATRA-differentiation sensitive once again [73]. It seems likely that loss of the PML-RARα protein and loss of its “positive signaling”, such as C/EBPε induction, is responsible for at least in part on differentiation resistance. Since only PML-RARα mRNA levels (not protein) have been measured in ATRA-resistant APL patients, it is unclear whether decreased PML-RARα protein levels also occur in resistant patients.

Failure of PML-RARα Proteolysis

PML-RARα protein is cleaved with the formation of a truncated form, ΔPML-RARα, following ATRA treatment in differentiation-sensitive APL cells including PML-RARα-transfected NB4.007/6 cells [44, 48, 69–72, 94]. Several agents, e.g., HMBA, increase ΔPML-RARα formation, and C/EBPε expression, and ATRA-induced differentiation in NB4 cells. In addition, ATRA priming treatment followed by the addition of cAMP increased ΔPML-RARα formation and induces differentiation in ATRA-resistant NB4/R1 cells [66, 73, 84]. ATRA treatment alone did not induce ΔPML-RARα formation as well as differentiation in R4 and MR-2 cells. These findings suggest that failure to form ΔPML-RARα might be another mechanism of ATRA resistance in APL patients that needs to be further tested.

PML-RARα FUSION PROTEIN IN APL

ATRA induction of C/EBPε expression was not enhanced by addition of NaB [84]. In contrast, agents such as HMBA, which do not inhibit HDAC, enhanced ATRA-induced C/EBPε expression [84]. These data suggest that HDAC inhibitors may enhance ATRA-induced differentiation through an additional pathway(s), i.e., not only through overcoming PML-RARα-mediated transcriptional repression by dissociation of co-repressors. Few studies have been performed to test whether HDAC inhibitors can overcome ATRA resistance in APL cells or patients. One report described a patient with relapsed APL following ATRA treatment that responded to subsequent ATRA treatment when combined with phenylbutyrate [100]. However, several other APL cases failed to respond to this combination treatment [101]. We have found that NaB only weakly enhanced ATRA-induced differentiation in ATRA-differentiation resistant R4 cells, and a similar result in the same cell line was observed using ATRA in combination with TSA [20, 84]. Moreover, it has been found that in another ATRA-resistant NB4 subclone, NB4/RA, trapoxin A (a more potent HDAC inhibitor than NaB) failed to overcome ATRA resistance [99]. NaB plus ATRA did not induce PML-RARα proteolysis and did not induce expression of C/EBPε in ATRA-resistant MR-2 and R4 cells, although both processes were enhanced in NB4 cells by this combination [84]. Taking into consideration that C/EBPε is an important mediator of ATRA-induced differentiation in APL cells, this result suggests that the HDAC inhibitors might not overcome ATRA resistance in resistant APL cells expressing the PML-RARα fusion protein. However, it has been reported that the HDAC inhibitor TSA overcame ATRA-differentiation resistance in APL cells expressing PLZF-RARα, the t(11;17) translocation product [16, 22, 102]. In addition, a synergistic effect leukemia remission has been obtained in PLZF-RARα transgenic mice that have APL using ATRA in combination with a new powerful HDAC inhibitor, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid [103]. These data indicate that at least some HDAC inhibitors might indeed overcome ATRA resistance or enhance the effectiveness of ATRA treatment in some types of leukemia. However, although differentiation and clinical remission have not been obtained in t(11;17) APL cells and patients after treatment with ATRA alone, the PLZF-RARα protein is highly sensitive to ATRA-mediated degradation [104–106]. Thus the observed effects of HDAC inhibitors on ATRA actions in these cells may occur through a PLZF-RARα-independent pathway. It has been found that treatment with HDAC inhibitors plus ATRA has a synergistic effect on differentiation in leukemia cells that do not contain fusion proteins [99, 107, 108]. One possible explanation for this synergy is that HDAC inhibitors enhance the activity of transcription factors that are induced by ATRA.

HISTONE DEACETYLASE INHIBITORS ENHANCE ATRA-INDUCED DIFFERENTIATION IN APL CELLS

Both RARα and PML-RARα in the absence of ligand repress transcription by recruiting the histone deacetylase (HDAC) complex through direct interaction with the nuclear corepressors NCoR and SMRT [11, 49, 97]. HDAC activity is thought to mediate the establishment of a chromatin structure in which DNA cannot be transcribed. It has been reported that HDAC inhibitors, sodium butyrate (NaB) and trichostatin A (TSA), enhanced ATRA-induced differentiation in NB4 cells, and the mechanism underlying this effect of HDAC inhibitors is thought to be the abrogation of N-CoR and SMRT association with PML-RARα [20, 21, 98, 99]. As stated above, PML-RARα protein undergoes proteolysis in APL cells upon ATRA treatment. In addition to the mechanisms for this process suggested above, it is also possible that HDAC inhibitors may facilitate PML-RARα proteolysis thereby enhancing ATRA-induced differentiation. Studies in our laboratory have assayed the levels of PML-RARα proteolysis and ATRA target gene expression in NB4 cells after combined treatment with ATRA and NaB and found that NaB not only enhanced ATRA-induced gene expression, but also enhanced ATRA-mediated PML-RARα proteolysis [84]. Surprisingly, although several genes (e.g., p21<sup>waf1/cip-1</sup>) were induced in a synergistic fashion by ATRA plus NaB, the

As₂O₃ OVERCOMES RESISTANCE OF APL CELLS TO ATRA-INDUCED DIFFERENTIATION

Ninety per cent of APL patients that are resistant to treatment with ATRA plus chemotherapy respond to As₂O₃ treatment. The current data indicate that As₂O₃ induces remission of APL through partial differentiation and apoptosis [40, 41, 109, 110]. Pharmacokinetic studies indicate that a plasma concentration of < 1 μM As₂O₃ mediates therapeutic effects without severe toxicity [110, 111]. More recent clinical data indicate that ~0.5 μM As₂O₃ is an effective plasma concentration in APL patients [112]. Since As₂O₃ at 0.5 μM rarely induces apoptosis in APL cultured cells, As₂O₃'s therapeutic effect in APL may occur mainly through differentiation induction [113–116].

Non-terminally differentiated APL cells have been observed in As₂O₃-treated patients and in primary APL cells treated *in vitro* with 0.1 to 1 μM As₂O₃, and PML-RARα protein was degraded by As₂O₃ at these concentrations [40, 41, 46, 48, 117, 118]. As₂O₃ treatment led to PML-RARα complete degradation without degradation of RARα in both ATRA-differentiation sensitive and resistant APL cells, and As₂O₃ treatment partially overcame ATRA resistance to differentiation in both R4 and MR-2 cells which were resistant to ATRA-induced PML-RARα proteolysis and differentiation [48]. Interestingly, treatment with As₂O₃ plus GM-CSF or cAMP induced granulocytic differentiation in some ATRA-resistant APL clones even each agent alone did not work, and treatment with As₂O₃ plus 8-Cl-cAMP has been shown to have a significant life-prolonging effect in mice bearing ATRA-resistant APL cells [119–122]. The arsenic metabolite, monomethyl arsonous acid, did not induce PML-RARα degradation and failed to overcome ATRA-differentiation resistance in R4 cells [123]. These findings suggest that by inducing PML-RARα protein degradation and thereby eliminating its transcriptional repression effect, As₂O₃ allows physiological levels of ATRA, cAMP and/or GM-CSF to induce partial cell differentiation *in vivo* (Fig. 3). Indeed, it has been found that in ATRA-resistant R4 and MR-2 cells, ATRA and As₂O₃ acted synergistically, but not individually, to induce C/EBPε expression [48]. In addition, As₂O₃ did not overcome ATRA resistance in HL-60/res, human leukemia, cells which do not contain the PML-RARα fusion protein, or in NB4.306 cells, which have lost PML-RARα protein expression (Jing et al., unpublished data) [48]. These data suggest that differentiation induction by As₂O₃ treatment may be limited to APL cells containing PML-RARα so far.

with PML-RARα degradation [46, 79, 113, 124, 125]. However, As₂O₃-induced PML-RARα degradation and apoptosis appear to be due to different mechanisms. It appears that As₂O₃ induces apoptosis in APL cells through a PML-RARα degradation independent pathway. In NB4 cells, the antioxidants, N-acetylcysteine and α-lipoic acid, block apoptosis induction, but not PML-RARα degradation due to As₂O₃ treatment. In addition, low concentrations of As₂O₃ induce PML-RARα degradation, but do not induce apoptosis. Furthermore, monomethyl arsonous acid, an arsenic metabolite, is more effective than As₂O₃ in inducing apoptosis, but not in inducing PML-RARα proteolysis [46, 48, 123, 124]. As₂O₃ was found to induce apoptosis in APL cells that contained low levels of hydrogen peroxide-scavenging enzymes through a hydrogen peroxide-mediated pathway [113]. It is possible that the presence of PML-RARα protein may sensitize APL cells to As₂O₃-induced apoptosis indirectly by inhibiting hydrogen peroxide scavenging enzyme expressions.

Several reports have implicated proteolysis of critical proteins in the treatment of other types of leukemia. The BCR-ABL fusion protein has been reported to be degraded following As₂O₃ treatment of K562 myeloid leukemia cells, however, controversial results have been reported [126–128]. It also has been reported that in HTLV-1 containing acute T cell leukemia cells, As₂O₃ induced the degradation of Tax (a transactivator protein activated by HTLV-1) leading to cell death [129, 130]. These results suggest that As₂O₃ could overcome cell death resistance in non-APL cells by inducing destruction of other oncogenic proteins.

Acute myelocytic leukemia including APL is a clonal disorder that is the consequence of an acquired somatic mutation(s) in hematopoietic progenitor cells which result in fusion proteins in nearly 50% of AML patient samples [131]. The successful induction of disease remission in APL patients following individual or combined ATRA and As₂O₃ therapy correlates with reduction in PML-RARα protein due to induced proteolysis. This mechanism exemplifies a new treatment approach to specific leukemias, namely, the targeting of specific oncogenic proteins and suggests a rationale for the screening of agents that target specific oncogenic fusion proteins in AML patients.
