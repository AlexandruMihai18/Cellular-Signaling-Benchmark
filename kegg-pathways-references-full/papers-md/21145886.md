**ABSTRACT**

When cells undergo apoptosis, they can stimulate the proliferation of nearby cells, a process referred to as compensatory cell proliferation. The stimulation of proliferation in response to tissue damage or removal is also central to epimorphic regeneration. The Hippo signaling pathway has emerged as an important regulator of growth during normal development and oncogenesis from *Drosophila* to humans. Here we show that induction of apoptosis in the *Drosophila* wing imaginal disc stimulates activation of the Hippo pathway transcription factor Yorkie in surviving and nearby cells, and that Yorkie is required for the ability of the wing to regenerate after genetic ablation of the wing primordia. Induction of apoptosis activates Yorkie through the Jun kinase pathway, and direct activation of Jun kinase signaling also promotes Yorkie activation in the wing disc. We also show that depletion of neoplastic tumor suppressor genes, including *lethal giant larvae* and *discs large*, or activation of aPKC, activates Yorkie through Jun kinase signaling, and that Jun kinase activation is necessary, but not sufficient, for the disruption of apical-basal polarity associated with loss of *lethal giant larvae*. Our observations identify Jnk signaling as a modulator of Hippo pathway activity in wing imaginal discs, and implicate Yorkie activation in compensatory cell proliferation and disc regeneration.

**Introduction**

When cells in a tissue are damaged, proliferation of neighboring cells can be induced, enabling tissue repair. This phenomenon is central to epimorphic regeneration, which enables the regrowth and replacement of body parts after injury or amputation. The capacity of tissues to undergo epimorphic regeneration has been known for centuries and exists throughout the metazoa, although it varies between organisms, organs, and developmental stages. An important insight into epimorphic regeneration was provided by the observation that when cells initiate apoptosis, they produce mitogenic signals, thereby stimulating the proliferation of neighboring cells. This process, termed compensatory cell proliferation, was first characterized in the developing imaginal discs of *Drosophila*, but similar phenomena occur in other systems (reviewed in Bergantinos et al., 2010b; Fan and Bergmann, 2008).

Compensatory cell proliferation has been observed in *Drosophila* imaginal discs upon induction of cell death by X-irradiation, by expression of pro-apoptotic genes, or by mutation of the anti-apoptotic gene *thread (Diap1)* (Haynie and Bryant, 1977; Huh et al., 2004; Perez-Garijo et al., 2004; Ryoo et al., 2004). Compensatory cell proliferation is associated with the induction of signaling molecules that have been linked to the promotion of cell proliferation, including Wingless (Wg) and Decapentaplegic (Dpp) (Huh et al., 2004; Perez-Garijo et al., 2004;

mutant for these genes are induced by mitotic recombination in wing discs, they generally fail to survive, and are eliminated by Jnk-dependent apoptosis. But if combined with other oncogenic mutations, such as expression of Myc or activated-Ras or Notch, clones of cells mutant for *lg*, *dlg* or *scrib* can survive and form large tumors that are prone to metastasis; the growth and metastasis of these tumors also depends on Jnk signaling ([Brumby and Richardson, 2003](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ccr.2003.08.005); [Froldi et al., 2010](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2010.04.037); [Igaki et al., 2006, 2009](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.devcel.2006.01.015); [Pagliarini and Xu, 2003](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0092-8674(03)00588-6)).

The Hippo pathway controls growth during normal development, and its dysregulation is associated with oncogenesis (reviewed in [Reddy and Irvine, 2008](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.semcdb.2008.03.001); [Zhao et al., 2010](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2010.01.008)). Hippo signaling is mediated by a transcriptional co-activator protein, Yorkie (Yki) (reviewed in [Oh and Irvine, 2010](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tcb.2010.03.001)). When Hippo signaling is active, Yki is kept inactive, retained in the cytoplasm through the action of upstream tumor suppressor genes in the Hippo pathway. The key, direct repressor of Yki activity is the kinase Warts (Wts), which phosphorylates Yki ([Huang et al., 2005](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2005.09.025)). In the absence of Wts, unphosphorylated Yki accumulates in the nucleus ([Dong et al., 2007](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2007.08.027); [Oh and Irvine, 2008](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2008.06.036)), and in conjunction with DNA-binding proteins, regulates the transcription of downstream genes. Recently, mutation of *lg*, or activation of aPKC, was reported to result in activation of Yki, and Yki was functionally linked to over-proliferation phenotypes in these genotypes ([Grzeschik et al., 2010](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2010.03.054); [Menéndez et al., 2010](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2010.03.055)). The mechanism by which Yki becomes activated by these manipulations is not known, although it was suggested that it might involve mis-localization of Hippo and a Hippo-interacting protein, dRassf.

Here, we characterize the regulation and role of the Hippo pathway in compensatory cell proliferation and regeneration. Damage to the epithelial cells of the *Drosophila* wing imaginal disc by expression of pro-apoptotic genes results in activation of Yki. This Yki activation is mediated by the Jnk signaling pathway. We further determined that disruption of apical-basal polarity by depletion of neoplastic tumor suppressor genes, or activation of aPKC, activates Yki through Jnk signaling, and that Yki is required for wing disc regeneration after genetic ablation of the wing primordia. Our results identify Jnk signaling as a mechanism for regulating Hippo pathway activity in wing imaginal discs, and establish a fundamental role for Hippo signaling in regenerative responses to tissue damage.

The specificity of *lg* RNAi has been described previously ([Grzeschik et al., 2010](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2010.03.054)). The specificity *yki* RNAi was confirmed by rescue using a *UAS-yki* line to over-express Yki. Because we lacked a direct test for *bsk* RNAi specificity, all experiments with *bsk* RNAi were repeated using *UAS-puc*, which gave similar results.

Larvae from crosses of *rn-Gal4 UAS-egr tub-Gal80<sup>ts</sup>/TM6b,Gal80* or *rn-Gal4 UAS-rpr tub-Gal80<sup>ts</sup>/TM6b,Gal80* were kept at 18 °C for 8 days and shifted to 30 °C for 30 h to induce cell death. After cell death induction, larvae were either dissected or put back to 18 °C for 24, 48, and 72 h recovery. To make *rpr* or *hep.CA* clones, *yw hs-flp; UAS-rpr/CyO,GFP* or *yw hs-flp; UAS-hep.CA/CyO,GFP* flies were crossed to *tub>CD2>Gal4 UAS-CD8:GFP/CyO; tub-Gal80<sup>ts</sup>/TM6B*. Larvae were maintained at 25 °C for 3 days and clones were induced by heat shock at 38 °C for 10 min. Larvae were then kept at 18 °C for 3 days to let clones grow larger, and then cell death was induced by temperature shift to 30 °C for 12–14 h.

To evaluate the effect of *yki<sup>B5</sup>/+* on development timing, *rn-Gal4 UAS-egr tub-Gal80<sup>ts</sup>/TM6b,Gal80* females were crossed to Oregon-R or *FRT42D yki<sup>B5</sup>/CyO,Act-GFP* males. Eggs were collected at 25 °C in 8 h intervals on grape juice plates covered with yeast, and subsequently kept at 18 °C. The dates of larvae hatching and pupa formation were recorded.

For adult wings, larvae were maintained at 18 °C after tissue damage until eclosion. Wings were mounted in Gary's Magic Mountant, and measured using NIH ImageJ software.

EdU labeling was performed using Click-it™ EdU Alexa Fluor Imaging Kit (Molecular Probes). Images were captured on a Leica TCS SP5 confocal microscope.

### Results

#### Activation of Yki adjacent to apoptotic cells

To investigate the potential involvement of Hippo signaling in compensatory cell proliferation and regeneration, we examined the sub-cellular localization of Yki in wing imaginal discs after localized induction of cell death. In one approach, we adopted a system developed by [Smith-Bolton et al. (2009)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.devcel.2009.05.010) for analysis of regenerative growth in imaginal discs, which involves expressing pro-apoptotic genes throughout the wing primordia of the developing disc under the control of *rotund* (*rn-Gal*), and then controlling the timing of expression using a temperature-sensitive repressor of Gal4 (*Gal80<sup>ts</sup>*). The pro-apoptotic genes expressed were *reaper* (*rpr*), an inhibitor of the *Drosophila* apoptosis inhibitor Diap1 ([Goyal et al., 2000](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0960-9822(00)00662-7); [Wang et al., 1999](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0960-9822(99)80066-0); [White et al., 1994](https://doi.org/10.1016/0960-9822(94)90041-X)), or *eiger* (*egr*), a *Drosophila* TNFα that is a ligand for the Jnk pathway ([Igaki et al., 2002](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0960-9822(02)00662-7); [Kanda and Miura, 2004](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2004.03.035); [Moreno et al., 2002](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0960-9822(02)00662-7)).

Normally, Yki is predominantly cytoplasmic within imaginal disc cells ([Fig. 1](#fig1) A). However, if Hippo signaling is impaired, then Yki can be detected in the nucleus ([Dong et al., 2007](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2007.08.027); [Oh and Irvine, 2008](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2008.06.036)). When *rpr* or *egr* was expressed for 30 h under *rn-Gal4* control, most of the wing primordia was ablated, although a small, irregular region of *rn-Gal4* expression persists, which includes both dying cells in which relatively stable marker proteins (β-galactosidase or GFP) are still detectable, and some cells that appear viable ([Fig. 1](#fig1) B,C and data not shown) ([Smith-Bolton et al., 2009](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.devcel.2009.05.010)). Wing discs in which wing pouch cells have been ablated by expression of *rpr* or *egr* exhibit a striking re-localization of Yki to the nucleus, both in cells adjacent to the *rn-Gal4* domain, as well as among surviving cells within the *rn-Gal4* domain ([Fig. 1](#fig1) B,C). This re-localization implies that ablation of cells and/or induction of apoptosis results in a strong, local activation of Yki. Consistent with this inference, a downstream target of Yki, expanded
(ex) (Hamaratoglu et al., 2006), was upregulated within cells exhibiting nuclear Yki (Fig. 1D).

To investigate whether the re-localization of Yki was effected through an influence on Hippo signaling, we took advantage of the observations that over-expression of wild-type Wts has relatively little effect on wing growth in wild-type flies, but can suppress the over-growth phenotypes associated with mutation of upstream tumor suppressors that activate Yki, including fat, ex, and dco³ (Feng and Irvine, 2007, 2009). Over-expression of Wts similarly reduced the influence of rpr and egr on Yki localization, as strong nuclear Yki was no longer detected (Fig. 1E, F). This suggests that the influence of rpr and egr on Yki is mediated through an effect on Hippo signaling. Wts expression not only reduced the activation of Yki within the rn-Gal4 domain, but also in neighboring cells, which implies that the non-autonomous activation of Yki is dependent upon Yki activation within rpr or egr-expressing cells. This inhibition of nuclear Yki by Wts over-expression was not due to inhibition of cell death, because the wing primordia was still ablated in these animals, and nuclei that, based on their small size and basal location appeared apoptotic, were still detected (not shown).

**Apoptosis activates Yki through the Jnk pathway**

Jnk signaling is an important regulator of both cell death and compensatory cell proliferation (Igaki et al., 2002; Kanda and Miura, 2004; Moreno et al., 2002; Perez-Garijo et al., 2009; Ryoo et al., 2004). Egr activates Jnk signaling through its receptor Wengen (Kauppila et al., 2003), and inhibition of Jnk signaling suppresses Egr-overexpression phenotypes (Igaki et al., 2002; Moreno et al., 2002). We confirmed activation of Jnk signaling in rn-Gal4 UAS-egr discs by examining a downstream target of the Jnk pathway (puc-lacZ) (Figs. 2A and S1A). Notably, Caspase activation can also result in Jnk activation (Igaki, 2009), and consistent with this we observed induction of puc-lacZ in rn-Gal4 UAS-rpr discs (Fig. 2B). The observations that both Egr and Rpr induce Jnk pathway activation, together with its role in compensatory cell proliferation (McEwen and Peifer, 2005; Perez-Garijo et al., 2009; Ryoo et al., 2004), suggested that activation of Yki upon expressing pro-apoptotic genes might be due to Jnk activation. To test this hypothesis, we inhibited Jnk activation by expressing the Jnk phosphatase puckered (puc). Over-expression of Puc blocked Egr-induced apoptosis, and inhibited Yki activation (Figs. 2C and S2B). Rpr-induced apoptosis is not blocked by Jnk inactivation, but over-expression of Puc inhibits Rpr-induced compensatory cell proliferation (Ryoo et al., 2004). When puc was co-expressed with rpr, the developing wing pouch was still ablated (Fig. 2D), and apoptotic nuclei were still detected (not shown), but Yki activation was dramatically reduced (Figs. 2D and S2C). Although low levels of Yki activation (Figs. 2C and S2B), or rare nuclei with nuclear Yki (Figs. 2D and S2C), could be detected when Puc was over-expressed, this could reflect differences in the extent and pattern of activation versus inhibition of Jnk, and our experiments establish that Jnk activation makes a crucial contribution to the activation of Yki in and adjacent to Egr- and Rpr-expressing cells.

Expression of Egr induces non-autonomous activation of Yki, but Egr is a secreted ligand for the Jnk pathway. To assess the consequences of autonomous pathway activation, we compared expression of an activated form of the Jnk kinase hemipterous (Hep.CA) (Adachi-Yamada et al., 1999), with expression of Egr. For these experiments we used an enhancer from the spalt gene (sal.PE-Gal4) (Fig. 2E), previously used to express hep.CA in studies of compensatory proliferation (Perez-Garijo et

al., 2009). Most cells expressing *hep.CA* or *egr* undergo apoptosis (Figs. 2F,G and S1B). Nonetheless, nuclear localization of Yki was detected within and adjacent to surviving cells (Figs. 2F,G and S2D,F). When *egr* was expressed, a non-autonomous effect on Yki activation, in some cases extending for several cells, was clearly evident (Fig. 2G). When *hep.CA* was expressed, the non-autonomous effect was more limited, but still detectable in some cells immediately adjacent to *hep.CA*-expressing cells (Figs. 2F and S2F). Because analysis of *egr-* or *hep.CA*-expressing discs is complicated by cell death and tissue folding, we further confirmed the existence of non-autonomous Yki activation by *hep.CA* in vertical sections through the disc epithelia (Fig. 2F",G"), and in clones of cells expressing *hep.CA* or *rpr* (Fig. S1D,E).

Activation of Jnk signaling has diverse effects, but one major consequence is activation of caspases and induction of apoptosis (Igaki, 2009). Induction of apoptosis, and more specifically activation of the initiator caspase Dronc, can induce compensatory proliferation in neighboring cells (Huh et al., 2004). To investigate whether caspase activation and apoptosis contribute to the activation of Yki by Jnk, we expressed *hep.CA* or *egr* in animals mutant for a hypomorphic allele of Dr onc, *Dr onc*<sup>129</sup>. It has been reported that when compensatory cell proliferation is induced by expression of pro-apoptotic genes, including *rpr*, *hid*, or *hep.CA*, while apoptosis is reduced by *Dr onc* mutation, that overgrowth of wing tissue and induction of Wg and Dpp expression can still occur, even though caspase activation is reduced (Kondo et al., 2006; Perez-Garijo et al., 2009; Wells et al., 2006). In our experiments, staining for cleaved caspase 3 (Cas3) confirmed that the number of apoptotic cells upon Jnk activation was reduced in *Dr onc*<sup>129</sup> discs (Fig. S1C). However, activation of Yki was not diminished (Figs. 2H,I and S2E,G). In fact, many more cells with nuclear Yki were detected, both within and adjacent to the *sal.PE* expression domain, presumably because *Dr onc* mutation inhibits the apoptosis of cells with activated Jnk. These observations indicate that Jnk signaling does not require Dr onc activation or apoptosis in order to promote Yki activation.

We also took advantage of the decreased apoptosis in *Dr onc*<sup>129</sup> discs to further investigate the linkage between Jnk and Hpo signaling. Hep.CA-mediated Yki activation could be efficiently repressed either by over-expression of Wts, or by over-expression of Hpo (Fig. 2J,K).

**Regulation of Yki during wing disc regeneration**

The observation that Yki is activated after tissue damage, together with its importance for growth control, suggests that Yki activation could contribute to wing disc regeneration. To examine Yki activity during regeneration, we monitored Yki localization during recovery after conditional induction of Egr. *m*-expressing cells were ablated by expressing Egr under *m-Gal4* control for 30 h, then Egr expression was removed by shift back to the non-permissive temperature for Gal80<sup>ts</sup>, and the discs were allowed to recover. After 24 h of recovery, strong Yki activation remained detectable (Fig. 3B). Substantial Yki activation was also detected 48 h after removal of Egr expression (Fig. 3C), but by 72 h Yki localization appeared almost normal (Fig. 3D). This Yki localization profile correlates with active proliferation and regeneration of the wing disc after genetic ablation of *m-Gal4* expressing cells (Smith-Bolton et al., 2009).

Wg expression is also upregulated during regeneration, and Wg has been functionally linked to disc regeneration (Smith-Bolton et al.,

damage. Indeed, Jnk signaling is activated in neoplastic tumor suppressor clones (Brumby and Richardson, 2003; Igaki et al., 2006; Uhlirova and Bohmann, 2006). Thus, we investigated the relationship between activation of Jnk, activation of Yki, and tumorous overgrowths associated with cells in which the Lgl-Dlg-Scrib complex was disrupted. To investigate this in a system that would facilitate genetic manipulations, and to avoid the necessity of combining *lgl* loss-of-function with oncogenic mutations that could complicate the analysis, we depleted *lgl* from large, contiguous domains of cells using RNAi by expressing UAS-hairpin transgenes under the control of broadly expressed Gal4 lines, and in conjunction with UAS-dcr2, which enhances the effectiveness of RNAi (Dietzl et al., 2007).

Depletion of *lgl* in the posterior half of the wing disc, under en-Gal4 control, resulted in overgrowth of the posterior compartment (Fig. 4A,C,E) and loss of apical-basal polarity (Fig. 5C,D,I,J). Thus, in this situation *lgl* RNAi phenocopied *lgl* mutant discs, or *lgl* mutant clones co-expressed with oncogenes (Brumby and Richardson, 2003; Igaki et al., 2006; Uhlirova and Bohmann, 2006). The overgrowth was apparent from the increased size of the posterior compartment, which often became multilayered, distorted and folded (Fig. 5C,D,I,J), and was also reflected in elevated cell proliferation detected by EdU labeling (Fig. 4E). The loss of polarity was apparent from the rounded morphology and multilayered appearance of cells (Fig. 5D,J). In addition, proteins that normally have discrete localizations within the cells, such as Fat or Dlg, instead

became mis-localized such that they were equally distributed around the plasma membrane (Fig. 5C,D,I,J).

To investigate whether the overgrowth of these *lgl*-depleted cells was related to effects on Hippo signaling, we examined the sub-cellular distribution of Yki. A strong re-localization of Yki, from predominantly cytoplasmic to predominantly nuclear, was evident in posterior cells (Fig. 4A,C). A similar effect on Yki localization was induced by RNAi for *dlg* (Fig. 4B), which indicates that this influence on Hippo signaling is not

specific to *lgI*, but rather appears to be a property of the Lgl-Dlg-Scrib complex. To confirm that the relocalization of Yki to the nucleus is associated with Yki activation, we examined ex-lacZ; it was strongly upregulated in posterior cells of en-Gal4 UAS-RNAi-lgI wing discs (Fig. 4C).

To establish the relevance of this Yki activation to the tumorous overgrowth of *lgI*-depleted cells, we examined the consequences of simultaneous knockdown of both *yki* and *lgI*. Co-overexpression of *yki*-RNAi with *lgI*-RNAi blocked the overgrowth of the posterior compartment, and yielded discs in which the P compartment was reduced in size (Fig. 4G), and posterior nuclei appeared apoptotic (not shown), which indicates that Yki is required for the growth and survival of *lgI* RNAi cells. To examine the relationship of *lgI*-induced overgrowths to Hippo signaling under milder conditions of reduced Yki activity, we overexpressed Wts. Using a UAS-wts line that only modestly reduced growth of the P compartment on its own (Fig. 4J), we observed a strong suppression of the *lgI* RNAi over-proliferation phenotype (Fig. 4F), and also suppressed the influence of *lgI* on Yki localization and activity (Fig. 4I), resulting in relatively normal looking wing discs. These observations confirm that *lgI* acts as a tumor suppressor in the wing disc by limiting activation of Yki, and further suggest that the influence of *lgI* on Hippo signaling occurs at or upstream of Wts.

Lgl acts through Jnk signaling to regulate Hippo signaling in the wing

*lgI* depletion is associated with Jnk activation (Figs. 5Q, 6A and S4D) (Igaki et al., 2006; Uhlirova and Bohmann, 2006). Both Jnk activation and Yki activation were largely confined to *lgI* depleted cells, but occasionally non-autonomous activation was observed (Figs. 6A and

S4D). This is consistent with the reported detection of non-autonomous Jnk activation adjacent to *scrib* mutant cells in eye discs (Igaki et al., 2006). The general correspondence between Jnk activation and Yki activation in discs with *lgI* depletion suggested they could be functionally linked. To directly examine this, we blocked Jnk activation by RNAi-mediated depletion of the *Drosophila* Jnk *bsk*, or by over-expression of the Jnk phosphatase Puc. Both of these approaches suppressed the overgrowth of *lgI* RNAi, the nuclear localization of Yki, the upregulation of downstream target genes, and the elevation of EdU labeling (Figs. 6D,E and S4A). Thus, the influence of *lgI* on Hippo signaling and growth in the wing disc is dependent upon Jnk signaling. Strikingly, expression of *puc* or *bsk* RNAi also appeared to rescue the cell polarity defect of *lgI* RNAi (Figs. 6D and S4A). This was confirmed by the observation that the apical localization of Dlg and Fat proteins was restored (Fig. 5E,F,K,L). Thus, the loss of apical-basal polarity in *lgI* depleted wing cells depends on activation of the Jnk pathway. This observation, together with the general correspondence between polarity disruption and Jnk activation in *lgI* RNAi discs (Fig. 5Q), led us to investigate whether Jnk activation could be sufficient for polarity disruption. However, while some tissue folding was induced by Jnk activation, both Fat and Dlg maintained their normal apical localization in wing discs expressing *hep.CA* under *sal-Gal4* control (Fig. 5M–P).

In a recent study of *lgI* mutant clones in eye discs, activation of Yki was observed and attributed at least in part to activation of aPKC (Grzeschik et al., 2010). Thus, we investigated the relationships among aPKC activation, Jnk activation, and Yki activation in wing discs. Expression of an activated form of aPKC, aPKC<sup>CAAX</sup> (Lee et al., 2006), induced a modest activation of Yki in the wing disc (Fig. 7A).

B) en-Gal4 UAS-aPKC<sup>CAAX</sup> UAS-puc UAS-GFP. C) en-Gal4 UAS-aPKC<sup>CAAX</sup> puc-lacZ UAS-GFP.

Using the puc-lacZ reporter, we observed that expression of aPKC<sup>CAAX</sup> is also associated with Jnk activation (Fig. 7C). Moreover, the puc-lacZ insertion, which is also a puc allele, dominantly enhanced the Yki activation associated with aPKC<sup>CAAX</sup> expression (Fig. 7C). Conversely, reducing Jnk activation by expression of Puc reduced Yki activation (Fig. 7B). Together, these observations indicate that in wing discs, aPKC activates Jnk, and activation of Yki by aPKC is a Jnk-dependent process.

Jnk activation has diverse effects in different contexts. Our observation that Yki activation in the wing is Jnk-dependent in neoplastic tumor suppressors and in response to tissue damage is consistent with oncogenic effects of Jnk that have been identified in neoplastic tumor suppressors and during regeneration and compensatory cell proliferation. However, under other conditions, Jnk acts as a tumor suppressor by promoting apoptosis. Indeed, in eye discs, mutation of scrib in clones can promote Jnk-dependent apoptosis, and blocking Jnk by expression of a dominant negative isoform promotes the proliferation of scrib mutant clones (Brumby and Richardson, 2003). To directly compare the influence of Jnk activation on Yki activation in different Drosophila organs, we analyzed multiple imaginal discs from larvae in which clones of cells expressing hep.CA had been induced. Because these discs were isolated from the same animals, the intensity and duration of Hep activation (induced by first making Flp-out clones expressing tub-Gal4 and tub-Gal80<sup>LS</sup>, allowing clones to grow for three days, and then inducing expression of UAS-hep.CA for 14 h by temperature shift) should be identical. Strong induction of Yki was observed in wing and haltere discs within and adjacent to Hep.CA-expressing clones (Fig. S1E,F). By contrast, in leg discs, strong nuclear Yki was not detected, but instead we observed a more even distribution of Yki between nucleus and cytoplasm (Fig. S1G), indicative of a modest level of Yki activation. Finally, in eye discs, most clones were not associated with any visible change in Yki localization (Fig. S1H).

Discussion

Participation of Yki in regeneration and compensatory cell proliferation

Many tissues have the capacity respond to the removal or death of cells by increasing proliferation of the remaining cells. In Drosophila, this phenomenon has been characterized both in the context of imaginal disc regeneration and compensatory cell proliferation. Our studies implicate the Hippo signaling pathway as a key player in these proliferative responses to tissue damage. After genetically ablating the wing primordia by inducing apoptosis, we observed that Yki becomes activated to high levels in surrounding cells, based on its nuclear abundance and induction of a downstream target of Yki transcriptional activity. Moreover, high level Yki activation is crucial for wing disc regeneration, as even modest reduction of Yki levels, to a degree that has only minor effects on normal wing development, severely impaired wing disc regeneration. While it was known that Yki is required for wing growth during development (Huang et al., 2005), our observations establish that Yki is also required for wing growth during regeneration, and moreover that regeneration requires higher levels of Yki activation than during normal development.

Regulation of Yki by Jnk signaling

Our studies identify Jnk activation as a promoter of Yki activity in the wing disc. Most aspects of imaginal disc development, including imaginal disc growth, normally do not require Jnk signaling (Igaki, 2009). By contrast, Jnk signaling is both necessary and sufficient for Yki activation in response to wing damage. Jnk signaling has previously been linked to compensatory cell proliferation and regeneration in imaginal discs (Bergantinos et al., 2010a; Mattila et al., 2005; Perez-Garijo et al., 2009; Ryoo et al., 2004), and we can now ascribe at least part
of that requirement to activation of Yki. However, Jnk signaling also promotes the expression of other mitogens, including Wg, which were linked to regeneration and proliferative responses to apoptosis (Perez-Garijo et al., 2004; Ryoo et al., 2004; Smith-Bolton et al., 2009). Wg and Yki are not required for each other's expression, suggesting that they are regulated and act in parallel to influence cell proliferation after tissue damage. The mechanism by which Jnk activation induces Yki activation is not yet known. The observation that it could be suppressed by overexpression of Wts or Hpo suggests that it might impinge on Hippo signaling at or upstream of Hpo and Wts, but the possibility that Jnk-dependent Yki regulation occurs in parallel to these Hippo pathway components cannot be excluded (Fig. 8). The high level of nuclear Yki localization is striking by contrast with the more modest effects of upstream tumor suppressors in the Hippo pathway (Dong et al., 2007; Oh and Irvine, 2008), which suggests that Jnk might regulate Yki through a distinct mechanism, or simultaneously affect multiple upstream regulators.

We detected strong Yki activation within the wing and haltere discs in response to Jnk activation, but weaker or non-existent effects in leg or eye discs. Jnk activation has previously been linked to oncogenic effects of neoplastic tumor suppressors in eye discs (Brumby and Richardson, 2003; Igaki et al., 2006; Uhlirova and Bohmann, 2006), and it is possible that Yki activation might be induced in eye discs if a distinct Jnk activation regime were employed. Nonetheless, since we employed identical conditions in both wing and eye discs, isolating them from the same animals, our studies emphasize the importance of context-dependence for Yki activation by Jnk. A link between Jnk activation and Yki activation is not limited to the wing however, as a connection between these pathways was recently discovered in the adult intestine, where damage to intestinal epithelial cells, and activation of Jnk, can activate also Yki (Staley and Irvine, 2010).

There was a general correspondence between activation of Jnk and activation of Yki under multiple experimental conditions, including expression of Rpr, direct activation of Jnk signaling by Egr or Hep.CA, and depletion of lgl. Some experiments, most notably direct activation of Jnk by Hep.CA, revealed a non-autonomous effect on Yki, which

could imply that the influence of Jnk on Yki activity is indirect. Although the basis for this non-autonomous effect is not yet known, we favor the hypothesis that it is actually also mediated through Jnk signaling, as it has been reported that Jnk activation can propagate from cell to cell in the wing disc (Wu et al., 2010). Consistent with this possibility, we observed that a non-autonomous activation of Jnk adjacent to lgl depleted cells was blocked by depletion of bsk solely within the lgl RNAi cells. Conversely, alternative signals previously implicated in compensatory cell proliferation do not appear to be good candidates for mediating Yki activation, as we found that Wg is not required for Yki activation in regenerating discs, and prior studies did not detect a direct influence of Dpp pathway activity on Yki activation (Rogulja et al., 2008).

Activation of Yki adjacent to Egr- or Rpr-expressing cells was also reduced by over-expression of Wts. This might reflect an influence of Yki on signaling from these cells, but because expression of Wts inhibits Yki activity, and activated Yki promotes expression of an inhibitor of apoptosis (Diap1), it is also possible that this effect could be explained simply by Wts over-expression resulting in reduction or more rapid elimination of Egr- or Rpr-expressing cells; the reduced survival of these cells would then limit their ability to signal to neighbors.

Although Jnk has been implicated in compensatory cell proliferation and regeneration (Bergantinos et al., 2010a; Mattila et al., 2005; Ryoo et al., 2004), it is better known for its ability to promote apoptosis (Igaki et al., 2002; Kanda and Miura, 2004; Moreno et al., 2002). The dual, opposing roles of Jnk signaling as a promoter of apoptosis and a promoter of cell proliferation raise the question of how one of these distinct downstream outcomes becomes favored in cells with Jnk activation (Fig. 8). Given the links between Jnk activation and human diseases, including cancer (Bogoyevitch et al., 2010; Karin and Gallagher, 2005), defining mechanisms that influence this is an important question, and our identification of the role of Yki activation in Jnk-mediated proliferation and wing regeneration should facilitate future investigations into how the balance between proliferation or apoptosis downstream of Jnk is regulated.

Regulation of Yki activity by neoplastic tumor suppressors

Hippo signaling is regulated by proteins that exhibit discrete localization at the subapical membrane, e.g. Fat, Ex, and Merlin (Reddy and Irvine, 2008). The observation that disruption of apical-basal polarity is associated with disruption of Hippo signaling underscores the importance of this localization to normal pathway regulation. Our observations, together with other recent studies (Grzeschik et al., 2010; Menéndez et al., 2010), establish that Hippo signaling is inhibited by neoplastic tumor suppressor mutations, resulting in Yki activation, and that this activation of Yki is required for the tumorous overgrowths associated with these mutations.

Although our results agree with these recent studies in linking lgl to Hippo signaling, there are some notable differences. Grzeschik et al. (2010) examined lgl mutant clones in the eye imaginal disc, under conditions where cells retained apical-basal polarity, whereas we examined wing imaginal discs, where apical-basal polarity was lost. Intriguingly we found that conditions associated with activation of Yki by Jnk in the wing disc were not sufficient to activate Yki in the eye disc. This observation, together with the discovery that loss of polarity in lgl depleted wing cells requires Jnk activation, suggests as a possible explanation for why lgl null mutant clones retain apical-basal polarity in eye discs, that eye disc cells have a distinct, and apparently reduced, sensitivity to Jnk activation as compared to wing disc cells.

We also identified distinct processes linked to Yki activation in the absence of lgl. Grzeschik et al. (2010) reported an effect of lgl on Hpo protein localization. In wing discs, we do not detect the discrete apical localization of Hpo reported by Grzeschik et al. (2010) in their studies of eye discs. Thus, their proposed mechanism, involving activation of

Fig. 8. Diverse inputs and outputs of Jnk signaling. Jnk, a stress activated protein kinase, is activated by diverse stimuli, including caspase activation, ligands for Jnk signaling pathways (Egr), cellular stresses (reactive oxygen species, infection, cytoskeletal changes), and loss of apical-basal polarity (Igaki, 2009; Karin and Gallagher, 2005). Jnk activates apoptosis, but also cell proliferation. Activation of proliferation is mediated through Hippo signaling. The ultimate target of Jnk signaling within the Hippo pathway is not known, it could act upstream of Wts and Hpo, but might act in parallel to them (dashed lines and question mark). Yki both promotes cell proliferation and inhibits apoptosis through transcriptional regulation of downstream target genes.

Yki via mis-localization of Hpo and dRassf, might not be relevant to the wing. By contrast, we identified an essential role for Jnk signaling in regulating Yki activation in *lgl*-depleted cells in the wing. Because we did not detect an effect of direct Jnk activation on Yki in eye discs, it is possible that Lgl can act through multiple pathways to influence Yki, including a Jnk-dependent pathway that is crucial in the wing disc, and a Jnk-independent pathway that is crucial in the eye disc. Grzeschik et al. (2010) also linked the influence of *lgl* in the eye disc to its antagonistic relationship with aPKC. Our observation that the influence of aPKC in the wing depends on Jnk activation is consistent with an Lgl-aPKC link, and identifies a role for Jnk activation in the oncogenic effects of aPKC.

Our observation that the loss of polarity in *lgl* RNAi discs is dependent upon Jnk signaling was unexpected, but a related observation was recently reported by Zhu et al. (2010). These results suggest that the established role of the Lgl-Dlg-Scrib complex in maintaining epithelial polarity (Bilder et al., 2000, 2003) depends in part on repressing Jnk activity. However, since Jnk activation on its own was not sufficient to disrupt polarity, multiple polarity complexes might need to be disturbed in order for wing cells to lose apical-basal polarity, including both Lgl and additional, Jnk-regulated polarity complexes.

The discovery of the role of Jnk signaling in Yki activation provides a common molecular mechanism for the overgrowths observed in conjunction with mutations of neoplastic tumor suppressors, and those associated with compensatory cell proliferation, because in both cases a proliferative response is mediated through Jnk-dependent activation of Yki. Although the molecular basis for the linkage of these two pathways is not understood yet, it operates in multiple Drosophila organs, and thus appears to establish a novel regulatory input into Hippo signaling that is of particular importance in abnormal or damaged tissues. Moreover, Jnk activation has also been observed in conjunction with regeneration of disc fragments after surgical wounding (Mattila et al., 2005), and thus its participation in regeneration is not limited to paradigms involving induction of apoptosis. It is also noteworthy that under conditions of widespread *lgl* depletion (i.e. *lgl* mutant or *lgl* RNAi), and consequent Jnk activation, the balance between induction of apoptosis and induction of cell proliferation is shifted towards a proliferative response. By contrast, in the wing disc clones of cells mutant for *lgl* fail to survive, unless oncogenic co-factors are co-expressed (Brumby and Richardson, 2003; Froldi et al., 2010; Igaki et al., 2006, 2009; Menéndez et al., 2010; Pagliarini and Xu, 2003). The loss of *lgl* mutant clones in wing discs was recently attributed to cell competition (Menéndez et al., 2010). Together, these observations suggest that the choice between proliferative versus apoptotic responses to Jnk activation can be influenced by the Jnk activation status of neighboring cells.
