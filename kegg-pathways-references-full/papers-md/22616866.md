## Abstract

The present paper describes the biosynthesis of the thiamin thiazole in *Bacillus subtilis* and *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*. The two pathways are quite different: in *B. subtilis*, the thiazole is formed by an oxidative condensation of glycine, deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate and a protein thiocarboxylate, whereas, in *S. cerevisiae*, the thiazole is assembled from glycine, NAD and Cys<sup>205</sup> of the thiazole synthase.

## Introduction

The major thiamin biosynthetic pathway in bacteria is outlined in Figure 1 [1,2]. In this pathway, glycine (3) undergoes an oxidative condensation with DXP (deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate) (5) and ThiS thiocarboxylate (6), to give the thiazole tautomer (7), which then aromatizes to form carboxythiazole (8) [3,4]. The thiamin pyrimidine (15) is formed by a remarkable rearrangement of AIR (5-aminoimidazole ribotide) (14), an intermediate on the purine pathway [5]. Coupling the thiazole and the pyrimidine, with concomitant decarboxylation, yields thiamin phosphate (2) [6,7]. A final phosphorylation gives thiamin pyrophosphate (1), the biochemically active form of the cofactor [8].

Our understanding of this biosynthetic pathway is now at an advanced stage. All of the biosynthetic genes have been identified and cloned, all of the enzymes have been overexpressed, reconstituted and structurally characterized, and mechanisms for all of the biosynthetic reactions, except for the pyrimidine synthase (ThiC) are reasonably clear [1,5]. The entire biosynthetic pathway has been fully reconstituted using pure enzymes. In the present paper, we describe the biosynthesis of the thiamin thiazole in *Bacillus subtilis* and compare this pathway with the very different thiazole biosynthesis recently elucidated in *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*.

### ThiS thiocarboxylate formation

The chemistry involved in the formation of ThiS thiocarboxylate is outlined in Figure 1. Activation of ThiS-COOH (9), at its C-terminus, by adenylation, gives 10, which then acylates the IscS persulfide to give 13. Reduction of 13, by DTT (dithiothreitol) in the reconstitution reaction mixture, gives the ThiS thiocarboxylate (6) [13,14]. The biochemical reduction of 13 is not yet understood. In some bacteria, an additional protein (ThiI) mediates the sulfur transfer to 10 [15]. ThiS thiocarboxylate (6) can also be efficiently synthesized by treating intein-activated ThiS-COOH with ammonium sulfide [16].

The structures of the ThiF-ThiS complex and the ThiF-ATP complex have been determined [17,18] (PDB codes 1ZUD and 1ZFN). The IscS protein probably does not form a specific complex with ThiS/ThiF because all four IscS paralogues in *B. subtilis* are competent persulfide donors [14,19].

### Protein thiocarboxylates as sulfide carriers in other biosynthetic pathways

Protein thiocarboxylates have now been found to play a role as sulfide carriers in several other biosynthetic pathways, and sequence analysis suggests that this strategy may be quite general (Figure 2).

In molybdopterin biosynthesis, MoaE catalyses the transfer of sulfide from MoaD thiocarboxylate to give 19 [20,21] (Figure 2A). A protein thiocarboxylate-dependent cysteine biosynthetic pathway has been found in *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* (Figure 2B). In this pathway, CysM thiocarboxylate reacts with phosphoserine (21) in a PLP (pyridoxal 5′-phosphate)-mediated reaction to form a thioester (22). This then undergoes a nitrogen-sulfur acyl shift to give 23, followed by release of cysteine in a hydrolysis reaction catalysed by the Mec protease

### Glycine oxidation

The ThiO gene product encodes a flavin-dependent glycine oxidase that catalyses the oxidation of glycine (3) to the glycine imine (4) [9]. In the absence of the other thiazole biosynthetic enzymes, the glycine imine is hydrolysed to glyoxal. The structure of this enzyme, with N-acetylglycine bound at the active site, has been determined (PDB code 1NG3). This

[22–26]. A closely related pathway for the biosynthesis of homocysteine was discovered in *Wolinella succinogenes* (Figure 2C). In this pathway, HcyS thiocarboxylate (25) adds to O-acetylhomoserine (26) to give a thioester (27). A nitrogen-sulfur acyl shift to give 28, followed by HcyD-catalysed amide hydrolysis generates homocysteine (30) [27,28]. A fourth example is found in the biosynthesis of the siderophore thioquinolobactin (34) (Figure 2D). In this pathway, QbsE thiocarboxylate forms a mixed thioanhydride (33) with quinolobactin (31). Hydrolysis of 33 generates the siderophore 34 [29,30]. A reagent for the sensitive detection of protein thiocarboxylates in a proteome, which uses a click reaction between the protein thiocarboxylate and a fluorophore-tagged sulfonyl azide, has been described [31].

Formation of the thiazole tautomer (7)

The bacterial thiazole synthase catalyses the condensation of DXP (5), ThiS-COSH (6) and the glycine imine (4) to form the thiazole tautomer (7) [3] (Figure 1). A mechanistic proposal for this reaction is outlined in Figure 3. In this mechanism, DXP (5) forms an imine with Lys<sup>96</sup> of the thiazole synthase. Tautomerization to 38 followed by thiocarboxylate addition gives 39. An oxygen-sulfur acyl shift followed by loss of water generates thioketone (41). Tautomerization of 41, followed by loss of ThiS-COOH generates 43. Addition of the glycine imine (4) followed by transimination gives the thiazole tautomer (7).

In support of this mechanism, enzyme-catalysed exchange of the DXP carbonyl oxygen has been observed and the DXP/Lys<sup>96</sup> imine has been trapped by borohydride reduction and characterized by MS analysis. Intermediate 37 is supported by the observation of enzyme-catalysed exchange of the C3 proton of DXP. The unanticipated oxygen-sulfur acyl shift to give 40 is supported by the observation of oxygen incorporation from DXP and not the buffer into the nascent ThiS-COOH (9). Thioenol (42) has also been trapped and characterized by MS analysis and the final product (7) has been fully characterized by spectroscopic analysis [3,14].

The structure of the ThiG–ThiS complex, with phosphate bound at the active site, has been determined (PDB code 1TYG). In this structure, the phosphate and Lys<sup>96</sup> define the DXP-binding site, which suggests that Glu<sup>98</sup> and Asp<sup>182</sup> are also likely to play a role in the catalysis of thiazole formation [32].

Thiazole tautomerase

The thiazole tautomer (7) is surprisingly stable and the aromatization reaction to produce the thiazole (8) requires enzymatic catalysis. In *B. subtilis*, the TenI protein has recently been identified as the thiazole tautomerase [4].

The structure of the enzyme product (8) complex has been determined (PDB code 3QH2). A model of the enzyme substrate complex generated from this structure suggests that His<sup>122</sup> mediates the deprotonation at C2 and that the substrate phosphate group functions as the proton donor for the exocyclic double bond protonation [4]. TenI shows high sequence similarity to thiamin phosphate synthase, and the two enzymes are frequently incorrectly assigned in genome annotation.

### Thiamin thiazole biosynthesis in *S. cerevisiae*

The thiamin biosynthetic pathway in *S. cerevisiae* is outlined in Figure 4 [33]. The biosynthesis of the thiazole and the pyrimidine heterocycles (5 and 10) occurs by very different chemistry from that used for the bacterial biosynthesis. Labelling studies have demonstrated that the thiazole is formed from an unidentified C5 carbohydrate, glycine (3) and cysteine (11) [34–36] and that the pyrimidine (10) is formed from histidine (48) and PLP (49) [37–39]. Thiamin biosynthesis in yeast requires fewer enzymes than in the bacterial pathway. The biosynthesis of the thiazole requires only one protein (THI4p) in contrast with the bacterial pathway, which requires six (ThiO, ThiF, ThiS, ThiG, IscS and TenI).

All attempts to reconstitute the THI4p-catalysed reaction, using a variety of C5 carbohydrates, initially failed. However, a breakthrough was achieved by the detection of three metabolites (56, 63 and 64 in Figure 5) released from the protein by heat denaturation [40,41].

The identification of product 64 demonstrated that complete thiazole biosynthesis could be achieved using THI4p expressed in *Escherichia coli*. In addition, this structure demonstrated that the thiazole was adenylated, suggesting that NAD (45), and not a simple pentose, might be the donor of the C5 carbohydrate. Initial attempts to detect THI4p-catalysed modification of NAD failed. However, after the structure of THI4p was determined (PDB code 3FPZ) [42], it was possible to prepare an active-site mutant (C204A) that was free of the tightly bound metabolites 56, 63 and 64 [42]. This form of the enzyme catalysed the conversion of NAD (45) and glycine (3) into 56 via intermediates 51 and 52 and confirmed NAD as the C5 carbohydrate donor [43].

The discovery that metabolite-free THI4p could also be isolated when the *E. coli* overexpression strain was grown at low iron concentrations provided a source of native enzyme with an unoccupied active site. Treatment of NAD and glycine with this form of the enzyme generated intermediate 56. Addition of Fe(III) to this reaction mixture resulted in the transfer of sulfide from Cys<sup>205</sup> of THI4p to generate 63 and 64. MS analysis of the protein in this reaction mixture confirmed Cys<sup>205</sup> as the sulfide donor [44]. These observations led to the mechanistic proposal outlined in Figure 5.

![Mechanistic diagram of ADP-thiazole formation](#)

In this proposal, hydrolysis of the N-glycosyl bond of NAD (45) gives 51. Ring opening, tautomerization and imine formation give 53. Tautomerization, loss of water and a second tautomerization generate compound 56, the most labile of the three intermediates released in the heat denaturation experiment. Tautomerization to 57 followed by sulfide transfer from Cys²⁰⁵ of THI4p gives 60. Cyclization and two dehydrations give the thiazole tautomer (63), the second of the heat-released metabolites. A final tautomerization completes the thiazole formation. Our mechanism suggests that THI4p may be a single-turnover enzyme. This was confirmed by demonstrating a 1:1 ratio of THI4p to thiamin produced.

In conclusion, we have explored the mechanistic biochemistry of thiamin thiazole biosynthesis in *B. subtilis* as a representative prokaryote and in *S. cerevisiae* as a representative eukaryote. The biosynthetic routes are quite different between the two systems, and the reasons for these differences are not yet known. Mechanistic studies on thiazole biosynthesis in bacteria are at an advanced stage, whereas our understanding of the mechanism of thiazole biosynthesis in yeast is still growing, with many unanswered questions remaining. We have not yet identified most of the residues involved in catalysing the conversion of 45 into 64. We also do not yet understand the role of iron in the sulfur transfer or the physiological role of inactive THI4p.
