# THE PATHOGENESIS OF GRAVES' DISEASE

Bryan McIver, MBChB, PhD, and John C. Morris, MD

Graves' disease is an autoimmune condition of the thyroid. Ultimately, the hyperthyroidism manifested by patients affected by the disease is caused by the production of autoantibodies against the thyrotropin receptor (TSH-R), which mimic the effects of the hormone on thyroid cells, thereby stimulating autonomous production of thyroxine and triiodothyronine. However, the derangement of immune function ultimately leading to the production of these pathologic autoantibodies is complex, involving B and T cells and several autoantigens in addition to TSH-R. Best known among these autoantigens are thyroid peroxidase (TPO) and thyroglobulin, although increasing evidence suggests the involvement of other thyroid proteins. This article discusses current theories regarding the pathogenesis of Graves' disease, autoimmunity, possible predisposing and precipitating factors, the nature and character of the autoantigens involved, and prospects for specific immunotherapy for this autoimmune disease.

## EPIDEMIOLOGY

Autoimmune thyroid disease is the most common of the organ-specific autoimmune diseases, with spontaneous hypothyroidism being approximately fivefold more common than Graves' disease.¹³ The annual incidence of Graves' disease in the Whickham study,¹³ a population-based survey in England, was approximately 80 per 100,000 women per year, with most other surveys reporting incidence rates ranging from 15 to 50 per 100,000 persons per year.¹¹,²³,²⁷,³⁷,³⁸ The annual incidence in English men was less than 10 per 100,000,¹³ approximately eight to ten fold lower than in women, in keeping with gender differences seen in other thyroid diseases.¹¹⁶ The incidence of Graves' disease

seemed to rise between 1935 and 1967 in a retrospective survey of Olmsted County, Minnesota,³⁷ and between two surveys performed in Malmö, Sweden, in 1970¹¹ and 1990.¹² These observed changes in incidence may reflect improved case detection as the result of improved methods of diagnosis rather than real changes in the underlying incidence rates; however, an effect of increased iodine intake has also been postulated.⁶⁶,¹¹¹ The incidence of Graves' hyperthyroidism in Japan, an area of particularly high iodine intake, has been reported to be as high as 200 cases per 100,000 general population.⁹⁰ Similarly, increases in the apparent incidence of Graves' disease have been reported following the introduction of iodine supplementation,¹²,³⁷,⁵⁴ although in Switzerland, an area of mild-to-moderate iodine deficiency, iodine supplementation was associated with a 33% reduction in the incidence of Graves' disease.¹⁰ Further long-term, population-based studies are needed.

Although Graves' disease may present at any age, it is most commonly seen in adults aged 20 to 50 years.¹¹,⁴⁷,¹¹³,¹¹⁶ It is seen less often in children, at least prepubertally.¹²⁵ Even in children, however, a female preponderance persists, with girls aged less than 15 years tenfold more likely to have Graves' disease in comparison with boys of the same age.¹²⁵

## AUTOIMMUNE ASPECTS OF GRAVES' DISEASE

Evidence for the autoimmune basis of Graves' disease first emerged with the detection of a long-acting thyroid stimulator in the serum of patients, and the recognition that it was distinct from TSH.¹ The serum-stimulated iodine release from the thyroid glands of guinea pigs occurred more slowly and for a longer period than did pituitary release of TSH. Subsequently, identification of long-acting thyroid stimulator as an IgG⁶² and of TSH-R as the target for the antibody occurred over several years.³⁶ The antibodies against TSH-R were initially found in less than 50% of patients with the disease, leading some investigators to doubt their pathogenic significance.¹⁰² However, improved assay systems resulted in the detection of thyroid-stimulating antibodies (TSAb) in peripheral blood in more than 95% of affected, untreated patients.²¹,⁸³,¹¹⁴ The remaining patients most likely express antibodies transiently at levels below current levels of detection or possibly at high levels only within the thyroid itself, with very low concentrations detectable in peripheral blood. It is now widely accepted that all patients with Graves' disease possess these autoantibodies which bind to TSH-R and cause its activation, resulting in the uncontrolled production and release of thyroid hormones. The stimulation of thyroid cellular activity in vitro by IgG from affected patients¹ as well as the passive transfer of transient hyperthyroidism from pregnant women to their fetuses and newborns⁷⁸ are the strongest direct evidence of the importance of the immunoglobulin in the pathogenesis of Graves' disease.

Lymphocytic infiltrates within the thyroid glands of patients with Graves' disease have been recognized for many years, although the degree of infiltration is highly variable.⁶⁸ The overlap in histologic appearance between Graves' disease and Hashimoto's thyroiditis is prominent, with only the presence of hyperplastic, hyperplastic follicles marking the overproduction of thyroid hormones characteristic of Graves' disease. The lymphocytic infiltrate is characterized by a preponderance of T cells and a smaller number of B cells and plasma cells seen in association with germinal centers, reminiscent of the lymphoid tissue seen in association with mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) and termed thyroid-associated lymphoid tissue (TALT).²⁶

A proportion of patients with Graves' disease undergo spontaneous remission or experience hypothyroidism in the long term,⁵⁸ possibly related to the follicular cell destruction seen in both Hashimoto's thyroiditis and Graves' disease.⁶⁷ Patients with Graves' disease also express antibodies against TPO and thyroglobulin at similarly high levels as patients with autoimmune hypothyroidism.⁷⁶ The presence of TSH-R–blocking antibodies that bind the TSH receptor in a similar fashion to the antibodies in patients with Graves' disease but that block rather than activate the receptor explains some cases of atrophic hypothyroidism.¹⁵ The recognition that some patients with Graves' disease can experience periods of hypothyroidism, and that this correlates with the appearance of TSH-R–blocking antibodies in the serum, completes the apparent continuum of autoimmunity between Hashimoto's thyroiditis and hypothyroidism on one extreme and Graves' hyperthyroidism on the other.⁵⁶

The presence of lymphocytic infiltrates in the extraocular muscles of patients with Graves' ophthalmopathy⁵⁰ and in the subcutaneous tissue of patients with dermopathy,⁵⁹ and the close association of these three apparently distinct aspects of Graves' disease, emphasize the systemic nature of the autoimmune process.⁵⁹ Whether these apparently disparate manifestations of the disease process represent a common underlying immune system defect, a single common abnormal antigen, or the presence of antibodies which cross-react with several antigens remains the subject of considerable discussion.

There is a clear association between Graves' disease and the other organ-specific autoimmune syndromes, including type I diabetes mellitus, Addison's disease, vitiligo, myasthenia gravis, and premature ovarian failure.¹²⁶ The existence of syndromes of failure of multiple endocrine organs, including Hashimoto's thyroiditis and Graves' disease, often in association with evidence of a generalized immune defect (the polyglandular autoimmune syndromes⁷⁹) supports the hypothesis that these conditions have a common etiology, and that this is likely to be a subtle but generalized immune system abnormality.

## AUTOANTIGENS IN GRAVES' DISEASE

Patients with Graves' disease commonly have antibodies to several thyroidal antigens. The most important and frequent of these are directed toward TSH-R. Other antigens that are frequent targets in the disease include TPO and thyroglobulin, and recent studies suggest that the thyroidal iodide transporter may also represent an autoantigen.³¹, ⁸¹, ⁹⁶ Whereas anti-TSH-R antibodies are clearly important in the pathogenesis of the disease, anti-TPO and anti-thyroglobulin seem to have little role, serving instead as markers of thyroid autoimmunity and susceptibility.¹¹² The latter two antigens are not discussed further, and the interested reader is directed to recent reviews for additional information.⁶⁹, ⁷⁶, ⁷⁷ Autoantibodies against the iodide transporter have been detected in sera of patients with Graves' disease and Hashimoto's thyroiditis, but their pathophysiologic significance is not yet known.⁹⁶

### Thyrotropin Receptor

The TSH-R is the most important autoantigen in Graves' disease. Antibodies directed against it mimic the effects of TSH, stimulating thyroid cell function and causing hyperthyroidism, and it is apparent that all patients with the disease harbor such antibodies. The TSH-R molecule is a membrane-bound glycoprotein

which, characteristic of G protein-linked receptors, spans the membrane seven times. The amino terminal portion of the molecule constitutes an approximately 400-amino acid extracellular domain that contains most of the binding regions for the ligand hormone,^{82,88,101} although some evidence suggests that the small loops lying between the membrane-spanning segments may also contribute to this activity.^{18,46} After interaction of TSH-R with TSH or TSAb, G protein-linked mechanisms activate adenylate cyclase which produces cAMP. Although cAMP generation seems to be responsible for the majority of intracellular processes that occur subsequent to ligand binding, other signaling mechanisms, especially inositol phosphate turnover and intracellular calcium ion fluxes, are also affected.

# Immune Response to Thyrotropin Receptor

All patients with Graves' disease and some patients with other forms of autoimmune thyroid disease express autoantibodies against TSH-R. However, the magnitude of the response (titer), the bioactivity of the autoantibodies, and the range of epitopes involved are highly heterogeneous.

Thyroid-stimulating antibodies which bind to TSH-R and which mimic the effects of TSH leading to autonomous hyperactivity of the gland are the most frequently recognized types in Graves' disease. Current in vitro bioassays detect these antibodies in circulating plasma in more than 80% to 100% of patients.^{57,83,86,114} However, some autoantibodies bind to TSH-R without exerting stimulating activity and may, by blocking the binding of TSH, inhibit thyroid function.^{7,21} Although most often recognized in patients with primary hypothyroidism, these thyroid-blocking antibodies are also present in some patients with hyperthyroid Graves' disease in association with the more typical stimulatory ones.^{60,72,84}

Cloning and the subsequent ability to express recombinant TSH-R have allowed detailed examination of the epitopes for autoantibodies. Most of these epitopes lie within the extracellular domain,^{61,80,84,89} although evidence also exists for involvement of the transmembrane domain, especially the small loops lying between the membrane-spanning segments.^{32,84} Identification of the specific regions of TSH-R that are responsible for this interaction has been more elusive, however; and considerable controversy exists in the literature as to the nature of these sites. Several phenomena most likely explain this confusion, including a highly heterogeneous antibody response to TSH-R, the finding that the antibodies recognize both conformational and linear epitopes,^{115} and the apparent low titer of the antibodies in sera,^{53} making direct assessment of their activity and sites of interaction difficult.

# ALTERED IMMUNE SYSTEM FUNCTION IN GRAVES' DISEASE

Evidence for abnormalities in immune system function is commonly found in patients with Graves' disease. This includes the presence of circulating autoantibodies directed against a variety of antigens, discussed previously. Circulating levels of various cytokines, including the interleukins 1, 4, 8, and 10 and interferon gamma, are also present in the peripheral blood of patients with Graves' disease at higher than normal concentrations.^{49,52} The source of these circulating cytokines is probably the thyroid, and many of the interleukins are expressed at

high levels in the thyroid of patients with Graves' disease,${}^{3,118}$ mainly by intra-  
thyroidal lymphocytes. ${}^{118}$  

Numerous and often contradictory reports describe changes in the pattern  
of circulating T lymphocytes in Graves' disease. ${}^{33}$ Clearly, however, activated T  
cells directed against thyroidal and nonthyroidal antigens are present in peripheral  
blood from patients with Graves' disease ${}^{8,85}$ and in the thyroid itself. ${}^{109}$  
When stimulated by nonspecific activators, such as phytohemagglutinin, these  
lymphocytes produce relatively less IL-2, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-  
alpha), and interferon gamma and more IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10 than normals,  
consistent with a so-called "Th2" pattern, indicating a bias towards B-cell maturation and an antibody-mediated immune response. ${}^{55}$ A similar Th2 pattern has  
been observed in thyroid tissue in Graves' disease, ${}^{49}$ particularly in patients with  
high concentrations of circulating TPO antibodies. However, T cells from retro-  
orbital tissues of patients with Graves' ophthalmopathy exhibit a Th1 pattern,  
with production of IL-2, interferon gamma, and TNF-alpha but not IL-4 or IL-  
10, suggesting that these cells support a predominantly cell-mediated immune  
response. ${}^{24}$ These divergent results in different tissues, affected presumably by  
the same disease process, suggest that the type of immune response is a function  
of the tissue and most likely the offending autoantigen rather than being caused  
by an underlying defect in the immune system.  

Thymic hyperplasia has been reported in untreated Graves' disease. This  
tissue involutes rapidly but incompletely with antithyroid drug treatment. ${}^{87}$ In  
the same study, both mRNA encoding TSH-R and the protein itself were detected  
in normal thymic tissue of patients without evidence of Graves' disease. Given the central role of the thymic microenvironment in determining self-  
versus nonself-recognition by T lymphocytes, ${}^{33}$ it is tempting to speculate that an  
abnormality of thymic function might be involved in the etiology of autoimmune  
thyroid disease. However, other than in rare cases of polyglandular autoimmune  
syndrome, which may represent an inherited T-cell defect ${}^{79}$ and which are  
associated with yeast infections and generalized impairment of mucosal defenses, patients with Graves' disease do not sustain obviously impaired immune  
system function other than their predisposition to autoimmunity.  

## IMMUNE TOLERANCE AND SELF-RECOGNITION IN  
GRAVES' DISEASE  

The most widely accepted concept for the development of autoimmune  
disease is that it arises as a failure of the immune system to distinguish self  
from nonself, triggering a cascade of humoral and cell-mediated responses  
against the offending autoantigen. The induction of self-tolerance is a complex  
and incompletely understood phenomenon involving both the elimination of  
(by apoptosis) and the induction of anergy or unresponsiveness in self-reactive  
T cells in the thymus and peripheral tissues. This subject has been reviewed  
extensively and elegantly elsewhere. ${}^{30,121}$ Briefly, T lymphocytes mature in the  
specialized microenvironment of the thymus, where self-antigens (presumably  
including TSH-R ${}^{87}$ ) are complexed with class II major histocompatibility complex  
(MHC) molecules on the surface of thymic epithelial cells. Recognition of the  
antigen-MHC complex by the T-cell receptor (TCR) of T lymphocytes, in the  
absence of essential costimulator signals (most likely, B7:CD28/CTLA-4 ${}^{97}$ ) on  
the thymic epithelium, results in apoptosis and removal of the self-reactive T-  
cell clone (Fig. 1A). This process does not eliminate all self-reacting clones,  
however, removing only cells with the highest affinity for autoantigens or

Figure 1. A, The mechanism of self-tolerance involves the elimination of immature, self-reactive T lymphocytes in the thymus. Interaction of the naive T cell (via its T-cell receptor) with the thymus epithelial cell expressing MHC-class II/antigen complex, in the absence of co-stimulator receptor activation, induces apoptosis or anergy in the T cell. B, Presentation of antigen, together with activation of co-stimulator receptors, by specialized antigen-presenting cells results in clonal expansion of the T cell and initiation of the immune system cascade. C, Peripheral tolerance is maintained by the ability of nonimmune cells, including thyrocytes, to express MHC/antigen complexes when stimulated by cytokines. If antigen is recognized by weakly self-reactive T cells, the cytokine release from these cells induces thyrocytes to express MHC/antigen complex. In the absence of co-stimulator receptor activation, anergy again is induced in the T cell.

possibly with the highest number of surface TCRs.⁹⁹ The remaining weakly self-reactive T cells are subject to control by the process of peripheral tolerance.⁹⁷ Expression of MHC class II molecules/antigen complexes can be induced in nonimmune cells (including thyrocytes¹⁰⁰) by various cytokines. In the presence of these MHC class II/antigen complexes, and in the absence of the necessary costimulatory signal(s), once again the T cells are inactivated¹²¹ (Fig. 1C). The maintenance of self-tolerance therefore seems to be a delicate balance between weakly self-reactive T cells on the one hand and inactivating factors on nonimmune system cells on the other. If a self-reactive T cell becomes activated and releases cytokines, the thyrocyte will respond by displaying antigen/MHC class II complexes to inactivate the reaction before an inflammatory cascade can commence.¹⁰⁴ Because T cells are essential for the maturation and maintenance of B cells, antibodies will only be produced if a T-cell clone becomes activated.
and it seems that the maintenance of self-tolerance is a function exclusively of T cells. ${ }^{116,121}$

It seems likely that the process of autoimmunity is triggered by the failure of the system of immune tolerance. This could occur by one or more mechanisms. First, a failure of apoptotic elimination of self-reactive T-cell clones in the thymus would result in circulating high-affinity self-reactive T cells. This would most likely result in aggressive early-onset autoimmunity rather than the usual pattern of onset of symptoms in early and mid adult life. Secondly, an antigen might be presented in adult life which has not previously been exposed to the immune system or presented in the thymus. This antigen would then appear as nonself and would be the focus of vigorous autoimmunity. It has been postulated that such a phenomenon explains the development of sympathetic ophthalmia which results in bilateral ophthalmitis following injury to the lens of one eye, a presumed “immune-privileged” site. ${ }^{110}$

An alternative hypothesis is that, whereas thymic elimination of high-affinity self-reactive T cells is normal, there is a failure of local peripheral tolerance permitting activation of the weakly self-reactive cells which are not eliminated in the thymus. This could result from a T-cell defect, causing failure of the inactivation normally signaled by interaction of a TCR with the MHC/antigen complex on the stimulated nonimmune cell. This might be expected to be a global failure which would result in the development of autoimmunity affecting multiple organ systems. Alternatively, the problem could lie at the level of the thyrocyte. If this cell is recognized by a weakly self-reactive T cell but fails to produce an adequate MHC/antigen complex, T-cell inactivation will fail, the T cell will expand clonally, and further immune system cells will be recruited to perpetuate the tissue injury. ${ }^{120}$

A third possibility is an increased availability of antigen. If antigen is released from the thyrocyte and processed by antigen-presenting cells (dendritic cells, macrophages, or B cells) which express both MHC/antigen complexes and the necessary costimulators, even weakly reactive T cells might become activated and trigger the immune cascade (Fig. 1B). Such antigen release might result from direct cell injury (e.g., following radioactive iodine administration), from stimulation by TSH or other growth stimuli increasing the surface expression of the antigen, or alternatively from exogenous antigen (e.g., a cross-reacting antigen carried by an infectious agent). Once initiated, the autoimmune process will be unlikely to remain focused on a single recognized epitope. The phenomenon of epitope spreading is well-recognized, ${ }^{104}$ resulting in a broad-ranged antibody and cell-mediated response to the affected tissue, and may result from the processing by antigen-presenting cells of antigens released during the early destructive phases of the immune response.

Unlike the lens of the eye, the thyroid is not an immune-privileged site, with free access of lymphocytes to the normal thyroid. Thyroid injury does not commonly precede the onset of Graves’ disease, except in rare cases which arise in glands previously treated with radioactive iodine for nonimmune disease. ${ }^{20}$ No antigen has been detected that is expressed uniquely in glands in Graves’ disease; early reports of polymorphisms of TSH-R which were associated with subtypes of Graves’ disease have not been confirmed in larger series. The multi-organ involvement of Graves’ disease and the multiplex autoimmune diseases suggest a generalized immune system regulation defect, and linkage with HLA haplotypes ${ }^{28}$ supports a role for MHC presentation or antigen processing as a component of the immune system dysfunction.
PRECIPITANTS OF THE AUTOIMMUNE PROCESS

### Infection

Infectious processes can potentially initiate autoimmune phenomena if the infecting agent possesses antigens sufficiently similar to host antigens to elicit a cross-reactive response. The leading candidate as an infective trigger of Graves' disease is *Yersinia enterocolitica*. Immunization of animals with coat proteins of this bacteria can induce antibodies that cross-react with recombinant TSH-R extracellular domain.⁷⁰, ⁷¹, ¹²⁷ Evidence also exists for subclinical and persistent infection with *Yersinia* in some patients with Graves' disease.¹²³ However, evidence that such infection in humans leads directly to autoimmunity and, specifically, thyroid autoimmunity is lacking.¹⁰⁷ Furthermore, the incidence of antibodies that react with antigens of *Yersinia* in patients with Graves' disease has been reported to be very low in some series.¹⁰⁰ Currently, there is no conclusive evidence that infection with *Yersinia* is a frequent causative agent in the etiology of Graves' disease.

Although the concept of infection of the thyroid gland leading to altered antigen expression and autoimmunity has appeal, little firm evidence for this mechanism in the pathogenesis of Graves' disease exists.¹⁰⁸ For example, the syndrome of painful (de Quervain's) subacute thyroiditis is commonly recognized, yet the development of thyroid autoimmunity and Graves' disease following the virally mediated disease is rare. Early reports of retroviral sequences found within the thyroid glands of patients with Graves' disease were not confirmed by other investigators.²², ⁵¹ Thus, the hypothesis of viral infection as an important etiology of Graves' disease, however appealing, is supported by little direct evidence.

### Stress

Recent case-controlled studies have demonstrated that patients with Graves' disease more often admit to major life stressors within the few months preceding the onset of thyrotoxic symptoms.⁶³, ⁹⁵, ¹⁰³, ¹²⁴ The pathophysiologic mechanism behind the influence of such events on the autoimmune process is unclear but could be related to alterations in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis that occur during and following the events, resulting in overall immune suppression.³⁵, ⁶⁵ However, the onset of thyrotoxic symptoms is a poor marker of the earliest immune events in the pathogenesis of Graves' disease, thus recent life events may have occurred after initiation of the disease process. The data on and potential role of stress in the etiology of Graves' disease, although increasing, remain controversial.

### Iodine

Studies performed in animals indicate that iodine intake and exposure are important features in the development of experimental thyroid disease. Genetically susceptible rats develop thyroiditis more often when iodine is supplemented into their diet than when it is withheld.⁶ This does not occur in other nonsusceptible strains, although other susceptible rat⁵ and chicken⁹ strains have been described. At least two mechanisms may be involved in the iodide effect. The first is related to the degree of iodination of intrathyroidal thyroglobulin.
that occurs in various iodine states. Iodinated thyroglobulin is more highly antigenic in comparison with poorly iodinated thyroglobulin, thus higher levels of iodine intake may lead to more immune response to the thyroidal protein.²⁹,¹⁰⁵,¹⁰⁶ Alternatively, iodide may generate oxygen free radicals within the thyroid, leading to cellular toxicity more directly. Although numerous data support the role of iodine in experimental thyroid disease, similar data in human thyroiditis and especially in Graves’ disease are lacking and unconvincing. The most suggestive human data come from the increased incidence of thyroiditis seen in iodine-deficient populations after iodine supplementation is provided,¹⁴,⁴⁵ but studies performed in iodine-replete areas have not found a relationship between iodine intake and autoimmunity.³⁹ Therefore, iodine intake does not seem to have a major etiologic role in the etiology of Graves’ disease in areas of the world that are not iodine-deficient.

## MODULATORS OF THE AUTOIMMUNE PROCESS

Treatment of Graves’ disease has remained largely unchanged during the last four decades and consists of thyroid ablation, either with radioactive iodine or surgery, or treatment with antithyroid drugs. None of these therapies is ideal, having either a high rate of iatrogenic hypothyroidism or a high rate of treatment failure.³⁴ Modification of the underlying disease process holds promise of curing Graves’ disease without the adverse effects of current treatment strategies.

### Immunosuppressants

Corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive agents suppress the autoimmune process of Graves’ disease, but their associated side effects and risks are generally regarded as excessive, except in rare cases of sight-threatening ophthalmopathy or as short-term adjunctive therapy while ablating the thyroid.⁹⁴

### Octreotide

Activated lymphocytes express receptors for somatostatin, which inhibits their proliferation.² Scanning with radiolabeled octreotide, a long-acting somatostatin analogue, reveals uptake in the thyroid and other affected tissues in Graves’ disease.⁷³ Octreotide reduces soft-tissue inflammation and abrogates the symptoms of Graves’ ophthalmopathy, although it is less effective than corticosteroids in reducing extraocular muscle size.⁶⁴ Its impact on the thyroidal autoimmune process has not been assessed, but it seems likely that side effects would limit its usefulness at the doses required to alter intrathyroidal autoimmunity.

### Antithyroid Drugs

The thiourea drugs propylthiouracil (PTU) and methimazole have been used to treat thyroid disease for almost 50 years and work principally by inhibition of the organification of iodine.¹¹⁷ PTU may inhibit peripheral conversion of T₄ to T₃, although whether this effect is clinically significant remains uncertain. In addition to these effects, an immunomodulatory role for antithyroid drugs—

roid drugs has been postulated.¹¹⁹ In vitro assays of antithyroid drugs show dose-dependent inhibition of lymphocyte proliferation.¹⁷ In vivo, the pattern of circulating T lymphocytes returns toward normal,⁴² although there is no apparent impact on the intrathyroidal autoimmune process.⁹² Despite these findings, the use of antithyroid drugs is associated with rapid and sustained reductions in titers of TSH-R antibodies.⁴⁸,⁷⁵ In addition, prolonged courses of antithyroid drugs seem to induce long-term remission in a higher proportion of patients with Graves’ disease than do short courses.⁴ However, initial reports that high-dose methimazole combined with thyroxine to maintain euthyroidism is more effective at lowering TSH-R antibodies and inducing remission⁴⁹ have not been confirmed, at least in whites.⁷⁵,⁹³

# Thyroid Ablation

Radioactive iodine ablation of the thyroid usually causes a fall in the concentration of circulating TSH-R antibodies over several weeks, although this may occur after a transient rise.²⁵ Surgical removal of the gland results in a similar decrease, and both of these effects are thought to reflect the removal of the autoantigen(s) responsible for the inflammatory process. Whether these treatment modalities offer any advantages to the management of the extrathyroidal manifestations of Graves’ disease remains unknown.

# PROSPECTS FOR SPECIFIC IMMUNOTHERAPY

Currently, intervening to modify the autoimmune process requires the use of agents which affect many aspects of immunity. The use of blockers or activators of specific T-cell receptors may, in the future, provide a means to affect more specifically the autoimmune process without altering the immune response to exogenous antigens. By presenting MHC/antigen complexes via antigen-presenting cells, modified to reduce the expression of costimulatory molecules, it may be possible to induce apoptosis or anergy in autoreactive T cells. Such an approach would have the advantage of being highly selective for lymphocytes directed against a specific antigen (for example, TSH-R), leaving the remainder of the immune system entirely unaffected. However, epitope spreading results in a range of antibodies (and therefore T- and B-cell clones) directed against a number of different epitopes, often in the same patient. Selective inactivation may prove to be too selective to impact on the course of active Graves’ disease. Nevertheless, antigen-presenting cells modified to express cancer cell antigens in addition to costimulators have proven effective in inducing an immune response against cancer cells in mice,⁴³ and a complementary approach inducing apoptosis or anergy in specific T-cell clones by the use of antigen-presenting cells modified to present MHC/antigen complexes in the absence of costimulators is conceivable. To date no such experiments have been reported.

Monoclonal antibodies directed against specific T-cell receptors can modulate the immune response by stimulating or blocking T-cell surface receptors.¹⁶ The therapeutic use of such antibodies in autoimmune disease, however, must await a more detailed understanding of the cell biology of the autoimmune process.

# Oral Tolerance

The oral administration of antigen can induce tolerance to the subsequent systemic administration of the same antigen^{40} through its effect on the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) of the gastrointestinal tract.^{19} This phenomenon of induced oral tolerance has been investigated in a variety of experimental and sporadic autoimmune diseases in both animals and humans and has proven promising enough for a variety of trials to be started for human diseases, including type I diabetes.^{122} The phenomenon may operate, in part, by changing the balance of the immune response from a Th1-type towards a Th2-type phenotype, reducing cytotoxicity and hence tissue injury.^{74} However, an increase in specific autoantibody titer and more acute disease progression have been reported following the induction of oral tolerance in a marmoset model of multiple sclerosis,^41 and an increase in the incidence of autoimmune diabetes was seen after high-dose oral feeding of antigen to chimeric mice despite an apparent successful induction of tolerance to antigen administered intravenously.^{13} These results suggest that the phenomenon of induced oral tolerance is complex, and that its application to Graves' disease, already a Th2-type response, may prove problematic. Nevertheless, oral administration of thyroglobulin has been shown to induce tolerance and prevent the subsequent development of experimental autoimmune thyroiditis in susceptible strains of mice while simultaneously reducing the IgG antibody titers.^{44} Whether such an approach might prove beneficial or harmful in humans awaits further study.

## CONCLUSIONS

Understanding of Graves' disease, its etiology and pathogenesis, and the underlying immune system abnormalities associated with it has advanced rapidly during the 40 years since Adams and Purves first described the long-acting thyroid stimulator. Despite this new information, current therapeutic options differ little from those available in the 1950s. Recent advances in our understanding of immune system regulation and of self-tolerance in particular hold promise that, in the future, we may be able to intervene in autoimmune disease in a highly specific, effective, and safe manner to modify and correct the disease process before irreversible damage occurs to the thyroid gland.
