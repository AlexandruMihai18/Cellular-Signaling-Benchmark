**Nicotine: from molecular mechanisms to behaviour**

Susan Wonnacott${}^{1}$, Nimish Sidhpura${}^{1}$ and David JK Balfour${}^{2}$

The addictive potential of nicotine is clearly recognized by the tenacity of tobacco smoking for most users, and has prompted extensive psychopharmacological studies in animals. In parallel, the interaction of nicotine with the many subtypes of its eponymous receptor has been the focus of molecular and cellular investigations. More recently, a convergence of these approaches has been stimulated by the generation of transgenic animals, which facilitates analysis of the impact of molecular changes on behaviour. Nicotine, like other addictive drugs including psychomotor stimulants, promotes dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens. This transmitter system has been a major focus of both neurochemical and behavioural investigations, although recently the pre-eminence of this system in nicotine dependence has been challenged. Complexities in the brain circuitry (including the subdivisions of the nucleus accumbens) and differences between behavioural models help to rationalise the current controversy.

**Introduction**

Nicotine is the principal psychoactive component in tobacco, responsible for the reinforcing properties that lead to the tenacious addiction and high incidence of relapse among quitters. Nicotine exerts its effects on the CNS by interacting with nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). Binding of agonist to these pentameric ligand-gated ion channels causes a rotation in the receptor that leads to the opening of the integral cation channel [1]. Neuronal nAChRs are heterogeneous, with at least six $\alpha$ ($\alpha 2-\alpha 7$) and three $\beta$ ($\beta 2-\beta 4$) nAChR subunits expressed in mammalian neurones. Their homomeric (e.g. $\alpha 7$ nAChR) or heteromeric (e.g. $\alpha 4 \beta 2$ nAChR) assembly generates multiple nAChR subtypes that differ in their pharmacological and biophysical properties, such as nicotine sensitivity and rate of desensitisation [2]. Importantly for the long-term effects of agonists such as nicotine, which might persist in the brain, some nAChR subtypes do not remain activated in the ligand-bound state but undergo a transition to a reversible desensitised state, which is resistant to activation [3]. The agonist-binding site resides at the interface of an $\alpha$ and an adjacent subunit, and differences in this region can influence agonist affinity (and hence potency). For example, a phenylalanine residue in the $\beta 2$ subunit has been proposed to confer high affinity for the binding of nicotine to $\alpha 4 \beta 2$ nAChRs compared with subtypes lacking the $\beta 2$ subunit [4].

The high affinity of nicotine for the $\alpha 4 \beta 2$ nAChR subtype, and its relative abundance in the brain, has led to the assumption that it might be a major target mediating the psychoactive properties of nicotine. Indeed chronic treatment of rodents with nicotine leads to an upregulation in the number of $\alpha 4 \beta 2$ nAChR binding sites in the brain [5], mimicking the effect observed in the postmortem brains of human smokers [6,7]. Originally assumed to be a consequence of sustained nAChR desensitisation, it has recently been proposed that this upregulation results from binding of nicotine to the $\beta 2$ subunit in immature intracellular nAChRs, thus facilitating receptor maturation [8]. This paradoxical phenomenon might have implications for withdrawal, rather than the development of addiction. Other subtypes of nAChRs might also participate in mediating the reinforcing effects of nicotine. Attention has focused on $\alpha 7$ nAChRs, because of their ability to modulate glutamatergic inputs and synaptic efficacy [9,10].

The cellular consequences of nAChR activation reflect the permeability of neuronal nAChRs to both Na${}^{+}$ and Ca${}^{2+}$, as well as their subcellular localisation and local environment. Thus nAChRs can produce local depolarisation, although it has been difficult to demonstrate that nAChRs mediate synaptic transmission in the CNS [2]. One example, based on immunocytochemical and electrophysiological evidence [11,12], supports the presence of nicotinic synapses on dopaminergic neurones in the substantia nigra. However, many nAChRs appear to be peri-synaptic or extrasynaptic on cell soma and dendrites,
or presynaptic on axonal boutons. nAChRs at these loci are perceived to be predominantly modulatory [13]. Direct Ca²⁺ signalling (particularly through α7 nAChRs that exhibit high relative permeability to this ion [14]) or indirect mechanisms by way of local depolarisation and activation of voltage-operated Ca²⁺ channels enable nAChRs to interface with a variety of Ca²⁺-dependent processes, both short- and long-term. Presynaptic nAChRs directly enhance the Ca²⁺-dependent release of many neurotransmitters, notably dopamine [15*,16], and also modulate dopamine release indirectly by regulating glutamate and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) release [17]. Presynaptic nAChRs can also influence synaptic efficacy and long-term potentiation [9] or long-term depression [18]. The view that dopaminergic transmission is central to reward mechanisms makes the associated nAChRs the conduit for the delivery of signals that instigate and maintain nicotine addiction.

### Midbrain dopamine system and the distribution of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors

The mesocorticolimbic dopamine system (Figure 1), comprising cell bodies in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and their projections to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) as well as other forebrain sites including the dorsal striatum and the prefrontal cortex (PFC), is regarded as the major substrate of reward and reinforcement for both natural rewards and addictive drugs, such as nicotine [19,20*; see review by Salamone *et al.*, this issue]. VTA neurones express a variety of nAChR subtypes which, when activated by nicotine, promote a sustained increase in dopamine release in the NAc that is considered pivotal to the development of nicotine addiction [20*,21*]. The nAChRs on VTA neurons might also mediate an endogenous cholinergic component of reward to drugs of abuse in general [10]. The cholinergic input is from brainstem mesopontine nuclei [22]: the tegmental pedunculopontine nucleus (TPP), which has been implicated in various aspects of dopamine-independent drug seeking and reward [23], and the adjacent laterodorsal tegmental nucleus (LDT, Figure 1).

Within the VTA, a population of GABAergic neurones provides local inhibitory input to the mesocorticolimbic dopaminergic neurones [24], and there are descending GABAergic projections to the TPP and LDT [25]. The VTA also receives GABAergic inputs from the TPP as well as from the NAc [24]. Glutamatergic neurones in the mesopontine nuclei and the PFC innervate different populations of dopaminergic cells in the VTA [26].

The NAc consists of two major subdivisions, a central core (NAc_core) and a surrounding shell (NAc_shell; Figure 1), which can be viewed as forming part of an extended amygdala [27*]. Although both subdivisions are important in learnt behaviours and Pavlovian conditioning, they are thought to make distinct contributions. The NAc_shell is involved in the acquisition of responding, such as lever pressing, for motivationally significant stimuli [28,29*], suggesting that it mediates the reinforcing properties of psychostimulants. The NAc_core seems to play a pivotal role in responding that is elicited, or reinforced, by conditioned stimuli [30**]. The discrimination of these two functionally distinct components of the NAc has been important in reconciling some conflicting data with regard to the actions of nicotine (see below).

Nicotine, like other drugs of abuse, stimulates dopamine release in the mesocorticolimbic system. Nicotine can influence the activity of dopaminergic neurones directly, by acting at somatodendritic or presynaptic nAChRs, or indirectly by modulation of inputs into the VTA or NAc (Figure 1). Most nAChR subunits (α3–α7 and β2–β4) are expressed in the VTA and an elegant combination of single cell PCR and electrophysiology in brain slices from rats, and from transgenic mice lacking nAChR subunits, has provided evidence for the diversity of functional nAChRs on dopaminergic and GABAergic cell bodies [31]. (α4)₂(β2)₃ nAChRs were proposed to reside on GABAergic cell bodies in the VTA, whereas dopaminergic cells possess multiple hetero-oligomeric nAChRs with more complex subunit compositions. α6 and β3 subunits are exclusively expressed by dopaminergic cells in the VTA, and more recent studies using transgenic mice lacking either of these subunits show that they predominate in presynaptic, relative to somatodendritic, nAChRs [15*,32]. Klink *et al.* [31] proposed the subunit compositions (α4)₂α5(β2)₂ and α4α6α5(β2)₂ for nAChRs on dopaminergic cell bodies; Champtiaux *et al.* [15*] suggest that these occur in the ratio 80:20; however, it is not known if these are segregated to distinct populations of dopaminergic neurones. The β3 subunit was not considered in these studies but might replace the α5 subunit in a proportion of somatodendritic nAChRs [32].

Various experimental strategies applied to striatal synaptosome preparations (the NAc being too small for such biochemical analyses) have resulted in a consensus concerning the presynaptic nAChR subtypes in the terminal field. Evidence for the subunit composition of nAChRs has been provided by co-immunoprecipitation experiments, in conjunction with ligand binding [15*] and following 6-hydroxydopamine lesions of the dopaminergic afferents [33]. Further support comes from pharmacological analysis of nAChR-evoked dopamine release [16], with comparisons of transgenic mice lacking a particular nAChR subunit. These studies have defined four populations of nAChR on dopaminergic terminals in the rodent striatum: α4β2, α4α5β2, α6β2β3 and α4α6β2β3 nAChRs. Every dopaminergic terminal appears to express nAChRs, as the common β2 subunit has been identified immunocytochemically in all dopaminergic boutons [34].

nAChR subtypes are segregated or co-localised, is not yet understood.

Functional α7 nAChRs were identified on dopaminergic and GABAergic neurons in the VTA [31,35], but presynaptic α7 nAChRs have not been detected on dopaminergic terminals. However, α7 nAChRs have been inferred to reside on glutamatergic afferents projecting to the VTA [9,36] and to the striatum [37]. Histochemical labelling has recently confirmed the presence of α7 nAChR on glutamatergic terminals in the VTA, where they typically have a perisynaptic localisation [38]. Together, these studies establish multiple loci through which nicotine might exert its effects.

# Nicotinic modulation of dopamine release

Systemic injections of nicotine, or direct application of nicotine into the VTA or NAc, stimulate dopamine overflow in the NAc, measured by microdialysis [39,40]. However, the dopamine responses in the mesoaccumbens to systemic nicotine are mediated by nAChRs in the VTA and are predominantly observed in the NAc_shell (see Balfour *et al.* [41] for review). In interpreting such results, it is important to recognise that microdialysis probes do not sample directly the release of neurotransmitter into the synaptic cleft but measure the changes in the concentration of neurotransmitter in the extracellular space between the cells. Dopamine overflow is influenced by the firing pattern of the mesolimbic neurones, and burst firing, rather than single-spike firing, represents a more efficient means of increasing extracellular concentrations of dopamine [42]. Systemic injections of nicotine increase the proportion of midbrain dopaminergic neurones that exhibit burst firing [41,43] and there is evidence that this is mediated by N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors located on dopaminergic cell bodies [41,44,45]. Moreover, nicotine increases extracellular concentrations of glutamate and aspartate in the VTA [46], and antagonism of NMDA receptors in the VTA diminishes nicotine-induced dopamine overflow in the NAc [45,47]. Inhibition by methyllycaconitine has been inferred to implicate α7 nAChRs (tentatively assigned to glutamatergic terminals) in nicotine-induced burst firing in the VTA [36*]. α7 nAChRs can also participate in plastic changes that enhance synaptic efficacy in the VTA [9].

The sustained elevation of extracellular dopamine for 60–120 min after a single injection of nicotine is characteristic of the response [40,48], and subsequent injections of drug in the 90 min period following a nicotine injection have little additional effect on dopamine overflow [41]. Mansvelder, Keath and McGehee [17] argue that this might reflect the differential effects of nicotine at different nAChR subtypes on excitatory glutamatergic and inhibitory GABAergic projections to the VTA. Presynaptic α4β2 nAChRs that facilitate the release of GABA desensitise more quickly than do the presynaptic α7 nAChRs that modulate the release of glutamate [17]. Consequently, there is a net shift towards stimulation of the mesolimbic dopamine pathway and maintenance of elevated extracellular dopamine in the NAc. This hypothesis [17] is compatible with the proposed role for burst firing in the mechanism underlying increases in dopamine overflow in the NAc evoked by nicotine.

Addiction is characterised by repeated drug taking. Repetitive daily injections of nicotine in rats cause increased dopamine overflow in the NAc in response to a subsequent systemic nicotine injection compared with drug-naive rats [49]. This sensitised response is characteristic of other drugs of dependence and is implicated in the transition to dependence [50]. Sensitised dopamine overflow in response to nicotine is regionally dependent, being observed in the NAc_core but not in the NAc_shell [51,52]. This is in contrast to acute nicotine injections in drug-naïve animals, which preferentially stimulate dopamine overflow in the NAc_shell [40,51]. There is growing consensus that the two principal subdivisions of the NAc play complementary roles in the neurobiology underlying drug dependence [21*,27*].

## Behavioural correlates

Sustained intravenous nicotine self-administration in laboratory animals, requiring operant responses such as selective lever pressing, provides a behavioural measure of the reinforcing properties of nicotine. Nicotine self-administration was blocked by dihydroβerythroidine (DhβE), an antagonist selective for nAChRs containing the β2 receptor, but not by the α7-selective antagonist methyllycaconitine [53]. Additionally, transgenic mice lacking the β2 nAChR subunit do not self-administer nicotine [54], whereas responding for cocaine self-administration is unaffected. Hence, nAChRs containing the β2 subunit appear to be critical to the reinforcing properties of nicotine. The stimulation of mesolimbic dopamine neurones is pivotal in this form of operant responding for nicotine [55,56]. This observation is consistent with the empirical hypothesis that increased dopamine overflow in the NAc confers ‘rewarding’ properties upon drugs and that this mediates their reinforcing properties in self-administration studies. However, recent experiments using different behavioural models have challenged this view.

Similar to humans, animals prefer environments that have been repeatedly associated with stimuli that have positive motivational properties. This conclusion is consistent with results from the conditioned place preference paradigm, in which animals choose between two compartments, one previously paired with drug, the other with vehicle [57**]. Animals will choose the compartment associated with positively reinforcing properties of a drug, or avoid a compartment associated with aversive properties of a drug. Nicotine exerts both positive and aversive motivational effects, which has made it difficult to demonstrate robust place-preference of the kind shown by other drugs of abuse such as morphine and amphetamine. However, preference has been reported with systemic nicotine at doses of 0.1–0.8 mg/kg [39]. More recently, Laviolette *et al.* [58] have shown that both reinforcing and aversive behavioural effects can be evoked by microinjection of nicotine directly into the VTA. The response depends upon the dose of the drug administered, with lower doses of nicotine producing an aversive effect and higher doses eliciting place preference, equated with positive reinforcement, in this model. Only the aversive response appeared to be dependent upon dopaminergic transmission in the mesolimbic

pathway, implicating non-dopaminergic mechanisms in mediating the motivational effects of nicotine [57**].

Differences between behavioural models can rationalise the apparently contradictory findings: nicotine self-administration is contingent upon a behavioural response, such as lever pressing, whereas in the conditioned place preference task nicotine is administered non-contingently [57**]. Mesolimbic dopaminergic neurones, therefore, might be implicated specifically in responses to addictive drugs that involve instrumental learning. Additionally, the mesolimbic pathway might play a central role in the acquisition and expression of behaviours associated with the presentation of conditioned stimuli whose salience is established by close association with the delivery of the drug [29*, 59]. Conditioned stimuli have an important role in both human tobacco dependence and drug-seeking behaviour in experimental animals trained to respond to nicotine reinforcement [60, 61]. Although the underlying neurobiological mechanisms remain to be established, results from studies with another psychostimulant, cocaine, have identified the NAc<sub>core</sub> as an important locus [30**]. Non-contingent presentation of a conditioned stimulus can evoke a regionally selective increase in dopamine overflow within the NAc<sub>core</sub> and stimulates drug seeking behaviour [59]; regionally selective excitotoxic lesions of neurones in the NAc<sub>core</sub> (but not the NAc<sub>shell</sub>) significantly impair the influence of conditioned stimuli on the acquisition and maintenance of drug-seeking behaviour [30**]. Hence, the primary consequence of the increases in dopamine overflow evoked by such drugs in the NAc<sub>core</sub> might be the compulsive or Pavlovian drug-seeking behaviour, in response to cues or stimuli associated with delivery of the drug, that characterize the transition to dependence [21*, 27*, 60].

### Conclusions

With greater appreciation of nAChR diversity at one end of the spectrum and of the complexity of brain reward mechanisms at the other, the understanding of the molecular and cellular processes and the anatomical circuitry relevant to addiction is gaining in sophistication. But there still remains a gulf in our knowledge between these levels of understanding. A major goal in nicotine addiction research is to identify the molecular mechanisms underlying long-lasting behavioural alterations induced by nicotine, in brain regions implicated in addiction. Prime candidates are transcription factors — nuclear proteins that bind to the regulatory regions of certain genes and thereby exert short- or long-term influences on their transcription. Further analysis of transgenic animals lacking or overexpressing particular nAChR subunits or other candidate genes, and the emergence of novel pharmacological techniques, coupled with the development of more selective nAChR ligands, will facilitate the integration of approaches to solve the abnormalities of nicotine addiction.

This paper shows that the role of conditioned stimuli in cocaine-seeking behaviour is mediated predominantly by projections from the core, but not the shell, of the accumbens. It also suggests that the primary role of the accumbal shell is to mediate the stimulant response to cocaine; when bathed with high concentrations of dopamine, the shell enhances

responding for the drug and the associated conditioned stimuli. Similar experiments have yet to be performed with nicotine. However, it seems reasonable to suggest that similar mechanisms are likely to be implicated in the neurobiology underlying nicotine-seeking behaviour.

This paper reviews the evidence that dopamine projections from the VTA mediate the aversive properties of nicotine in addition to their role in nicotine-seeking behaviour. The authors suggest that the primary role of mesolimbic dopamine neurones in nicotine-seeking might lie in their capacity to influence instrumental responding for the drug.
