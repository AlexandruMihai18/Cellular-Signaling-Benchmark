Abstract

*Myc* expression is deregulated in a wide range of human cancers and is often associated with aggressive, poorly differentiated tumors. The *Myc* protein is a transcription factor that regulates a variety of cellular processes including cell growth and proliferation, cell-cycle progression, transcription, differentiation, apoptosis, and cell motility. Potential strategies that either inhibit the growth promoting effect of *Myc* and/or activate its pro-apoptotic function are presently being explored. In this review, we give an overview of *Myc* activation in human tumors and discuss current strategies aimed at targeting *Myc* for cancer treatment. Such therapies could have potential in combination with mechanistically different cytotoxic drugs to combat and eradicate tumor cells.

1. Translating the Myc code

consists of an N-terminal transactivation domain (TAD) required for transcriptional activation, a central region, and a C-terminal domain (CTD) critical for DNA binding and protein interactions. Additionally, *Myc* has four conserved regions known as *Myc* boxes (MB) that are essential for different functions. The TAD, responsible for assembly of the transcriptional machinery, contains MBI that contributes to gene activation and protein degradation, and MBII that is critical for the majority of *Myc*'s functions [2–5]. The central region harbors the third

Fig. 1. Cellular processes controlled by Myc during normal conditions and during tumorigenesis. Myc is a key regulator of many biological activities including cell growth and division (regulation of chromatin modification and components of the biosynthetic machinery); cell-cycle progression (modulation of cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinases, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors and phosphatases); apoptosis (p53 dependent or independent mechanisms); cell differentiation (downregulation of growth arrest genes); cell metabolism (glycolysis, amino acid biosynthesis and transport, synthesis of macromolecules and DNA metabolism); angiogenesis (upregulation of VEGF); cell adhesion and motility (control of expression of integrins). Deregulation of Myc may result in apoptosis, genomic instability, uncontrolled cell proliferation, escape from immune surveillance, growth factor independence, and immortalization.

conserved domain, MBIII, implicated in transcriptional repression, apoptosis, transformation, and lymphomagenesis [6], and the recently described MBIV, that in addition to functions in apoptosis and transformation also modulates DNA-binding [7]. The CTD encompasses a basic region required for binding to the consensus CACGTG E-box and a helix-loop-helix leucine zipper (HLHZip) domain, necessary for dimerization with Max. The role of Myc in transcriptional activation is discussed by Cowling and Cole elsewhere in this issue [8].

## 2. Myc activation in human neoplasia

Myc expression is strictly regulated by external signals, such as growth factors and extracellular matrix contacts, and through internal cell cycle control. In quiescent cells, Myc levels are low while they rapidly increase upon entry into the cell cycle and then decline to remain at a basal level in cycling cells [9–12]. Inactivation of the stringent regulation of Myc expression results in uncontrolled cell proliferation upon alterations in the apoptotic pathway. The pool of proliferating cells has an increased risk of acquiring secondary mutations contributing to tumor development. Myc family genes are activated in a wide variety of human hematological malignancies and solid tumors (reviewed in [13–15]). Oncogenic alterations of Myc are induced by events such as point mutations, gene amplification, translocation, overexpression, enhanced translation, and increased protein stability. Table 1 summarizes the frequency of the most common Myc alterations observed in human tumors.

Burkitt’s lymphoma (BL) is characterized by chromosomal translocations that place c-Myc in the proximity of an immunoglobulin (Ig) enhancer, which promotes constitutive high levels of c-Myc mRNA and protein (reviewed in [16]). Myc rearrangements are also found in diffuse large cell lymphoma (DLCL), acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), multiple myeloma (MM), and primary plasma cell leukemia (PCL) [13,17–20]. Rare cases of T-cell leukemia, in which the Myc gene is translocated to the T-cell receptor have also been reported [21].

In contrast, the most common Myc aberration in solid tumors is gene amplification (Table 1). All three transforming members of the Myc family have been shown to be amplified in small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC), with a frequency of 10% (MYCN), 13% (L-Myc), and 20% (c-Myc) [13,22,23]. Interestingly, in glioblastoma, either one, two or all three Myc genes have been found to be overexpressed at different frequencies [24].

Cutaneous malignant melanoma is the most aggressive form of skin cancer. Treszl et al. detected c-Myc amplification in melanoma patients using fluorescence in situ hybridization. Extra c-Myc copies were found in 61% of nodular melanomas, in 28% of superficially spreading melanomas, and in 30% of metastatic tumors. Alteration in expression levels was associated with advanced stages of the disease, but the observation that c-Myc was less frequently amplified in metastatic lesions may indicate that c-Myc is important for promoting an invasive potential rather than in the process of metastasis [25]. Myc is also activated in uveal melanoma, the most common intraocular tumor in adults. One study showed loss of c-Myc in 5% and extra copies of the oncogene in 70% of the tumors analyzed [26].

The major genetic aberrations of Myc in human tumors include gene amplification in solid tumors and chromosome translocation in lymphoma and leukemia. Mutation of the Myc gene has also been reported in some lymphomas.

Ovarian cancer is one of the main causes of death from gynecological diseases worldwide, in which c-Myc or L-Myc overexpression is observed with a frequency of around 40%, while their amplification appear in 40 and 15%, respectively [27, 28]. In cervical cancer, c-Myc amplification was reported in 29% of abnormal epithelia compared to 8% in control tissues

[29]. Notably, c-Myc expression was associated with high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV), which causes more than 90% of all cervical tumors. In one study, amplification of either c-Myc or K-ras was found in 8 or 17% of renal clear cell adenocarcinomas, respectively, while co-amplification of both oncogenes was not observed.
[30]. K-ras expression was associated with a more rapid disease progression. Gugger et al. investigated the presence c-Myc amplification in various types of neuroendocrine lung carcinomas using *in situ* hybridization and immunohistochemical analyses and found that up to 23% of lung carcinoma samples displayed deregulated Myc expression [23]. Amplification of c-Myc was also found in 10% of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) patients treated by surgery and in 30% of patients subjected to multimodal treatment. However, the c-Myc copy number did not influence the overall patient survival [31].

Aberrant expression of MYCN is frequently, but not entirely associated with gene amplification. In neuroblastoma, MYCN amplification coincides with an unfavorable outcome and is taken into consideration for the assessment of treatment schedules [32,33]. Other malignancies in which MYCN amplification has been demonstrated include retinoblastoma, medulloblastoma, glioblastoma, anaplastic large-cell lymphoma, and alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (Table 1) [34–39]. Moreover, MYCN overexpression without amplification has been reported in breast carcinoma with a strong correlation to clinical stage, histological grade, and outcome of the disease [40].

In addition to genetic aberrations, autoimmunity, manifested by the presence of antibodies to autologous cellular antigens has been observed in a number of human tumors. Detection of antibodies against Myc in sera from cancer patients was first described in the late 1980s [41,42]. Auto-antibodies against L-Myc were found in sera from 10% of lung cancer patients, while no antibodies were detected in healthy volunteers [43]. In another study, antibodies against c-Myc were detected in sera from lung cancer patients (13%) as well as in samples from healthy volunteers (3%) [44]. A larger investigation including more than 500 patients with different cancers showed that substantially higher levels of antibodies against c-Myc were observed in breast, hepatocellular, and gastric carcinoma compared to control samples [45]. In addition, serum auto-antibodies against p53 and Ras in breast, colon, and lung cancer patients have also been reported [46–48]. The above-mentioned observations suggest that the detection of antibodies against Myc and other oncoproteins or tumor suppressors could provide valuable tools for early diagnosis or as prognostic markers for tumor progression.

### 3. Myc in relation to cancer therapies

Substantial insights concerning the biology and the treatment of human tumors have been obtained during the last decades. Today, rational drug design targeting proteins involved in regulation of cell proliferation and/or apoptosis is one major focus for development of novel cancer therapies. Treatment with compounds interfering with signaling pathways involved in these processes in combination with conventional anticancer therapy is particularly promising. Myc sensitizes cancer cells to apoptosis induced by various stress signals such as lack of growth factors, treatment with cytotoxic drugs, and radiation [49–52]. Accumulating evidence indicate that Myc levels in the tumor may be important when designing appropriate treatment strategies with the possibility to use lower drug dosages and thus overcoming drug resistance, drug-related toxicity, and side effects. Iba et al. found that responders to the treatment with platinum compounds among patients with epithelial ovarian cancer had higher c-Myc levels compared to non-responders, resulting in higher survival rates [49]. Several preclinical studies pointing in the same direction have also been performed [53–56]. Grassilli et al. demonstrated that the apoptotic response to etoposide and doxorubicin was impaired in the absence of Myc [57]. In agreement with their findings, we found that c-Myc overexpression potentiated cell death induced by etoposide, doxorubicin, and cisplatin, and that drug-induced apoptosis was Myc-dependent [53]. In addition, we observed that apoptosis induced by camptothecin and taxol was enhanced by Myc ([53] and A. Albihn, H. Mo, and M. Henriksson, unpublished results). Conversely, a decrease in Myc levels has been reported to enhance the effect of cytotoxic drugs [58]. In another recent study, Bucci et al. demonstrated that down-regulation of Myc resulted in increased sensitivity to treatment with gamma-radiation by inhibiting mismatch repair proteins and activation of a p53-independent apoptotic pathway [50]. In addition, pre-treatment with a polypeptide inhibitor of Myc/Max dimerization, which inhibited its transcriptional function, enhanced the anti-proliferative effects of doxorubicin and etoposide [59].

The above described data support the idea that treatment interfering with signaling pathways involved in cell proliferation and apoptosis, such as the Myc pathway, are promising in combination with conventional anti-tumor therapy (for review, see [2,60–64]).

### 4. Animal models for Myc-induced tumorigenesis

The two main strategies to study Myc in initiation and progression of tumorigenesis include the use of tumor xenografts and transgenic mouse models. Using the first approach, it was shown that medulloblastoma cell lines engineered to stably over-express c-Myc exhibited a markedly anaplastic histopathological appearance when inoculated to animals and had augmented growth and apoptosis rates *in vitro* and *in vivo* [65]. Xenograft models have also been used to study the effectiveness of various therapies targeting c-Myc and MYCN in melanoma [51], breast carcinoma [66], prostate cancer [66,67], renal tumors [68], neuroblastoma [69], and other neuroectodermal tumors [70].

The role of Myc in the progression of breast cancer has been demonstrated using transgenic mice with conditional expression under the control of the tissue specific regulatory mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) promoter [71–73]. Similarly, lymphoma development has been evaluated in mice harboring constructs with tissue-specific expression of the Myc oncogene from the Ig-μ or the Ig-κ enhancer. These animals developed lymphoma, representing B-cell and plasma cell neoplasms, within a few months of birth [74–77]. In contrast, differentiation driven by Myc has been described in an animal model in which the keratin promoter was used to express a Myc-inducible form, c-MycER™, in the basal layer of mouse epidermis [78]. Conditional Myc-systems have also been applied in studies of tumor development in hematopoietic cells [79], mammary gland
cells [80], pancreatic islet cells [81], liver [82], and skin cells [78]. Importantly, Myc inactivation resulted in tumor regression and/or differentiation in several, but not all, experimental systems [79–83]. One drawback of targeting Myc would be that treatment cessation (e.g., drug administration) might result in reactivation of the oncoprotein leading to tumor regrowth. It has been shown that tumors can survive in a dormant state retaining the ability to form tumors following Myc reactivation [82, 84]. On the other hand, Jain et al. showed that even transient inactivation of *Myc* was sufficient to achieve tumor regression and cell differentiation [85]. Subsequent reactivation of *c-Myc* did not restore the malignant properties of the cells but rather induced apoptosis, raising the possibility that transient inactivation of Myc might be an effective therapy for certain cancers. However, tumor regression upon Myc inactivation is yet to be demonstrated in the genomic more complex human tumors. Most likely, therapies targeting Myc may not be sufficient to cure cancer patients but should be used in combination with conventional remedies or with drugs that inactivate other targets. A detailed description on the role of Myc in tumorigenesis in conditional animal models is presented by Arvanitis and Felsher elsewhere in this issue [86].

**5. Strategies aimed at targeting Myc for cancer treatment**

To date, the prevailing approaches for the treatment of cancer patients still entail non-specific cytotoxic drugs, surgery, and radiation. Due to their frequent severe side effects, it is of great importance to develop novel, tumor-specific, and less toxic therapies. The main rationale for choosing Myc as a target for cancer therapy is that the gene is activated in a wide variety of human tumors, and drugs that specifically target Myc could therefore have an impact on the treatment of a broad range of malignancies. Moreover, Myc is involved in both proliferation and apoptosis, and thus strategies aimed at targeting Myc could either be based on inhibition of tumor cell proliferation and/or increase in apoptosis. Another reason is that reversibility of Myc-induced tumorigenesis has been observed in several experimental systems where Myc inactivation resulted in tumor regression and cell differentiation [79, 81]. Myc could be targeted at different biological levels and using various techniques as outlined in Fig. 2. These strategies may be employed alone or in combination to increase the effect of currently used therapies in the treatment of Myc-associated tumors.

Fig. 2. Targeting Myc at all levels. Strategies that are currently employed for targeting Myc include: (1) inhibition of *Myc* expression at DNA and mRNA level by interaction with the *Myc* promoter and interference with transcription (antisense oligonucleotides, peptide nucleic acids, triplex-forming oligonucleotides, TMPyP4, and siRNAs); (2) blockage of Myc expression at the protein level (small molecules); (3) disruption of Myc/Max dimerization (small molecules, overexpression of Max interacting proteins); (4) blockage of Myc interaction with other factors, e.g., TRRAP-histone acetylase complex (small molecules); (5) interference with Myc/Max binding to DNA (decoy oligonucleotides); (6) inhibition of expression of Myc target genes (antisense-oligonucleotides and siRNA); (7) modulation of the function of key Myc target genes (small molecules); and (8) promotion of Myc protein degradation (small molecules).

5.1. Sense or nonsense—antisense oligonucleotides targeting Myc

Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) are short single-stranded DNA molecules that specifically target, hybridize and inhibit the mRNA of a selected gene. Studies on nucleic acid targeting have established their efficacy both *in vitro* and *in vivo*. It has been demonstrated that downregulation of *Myc* expression using ASOs resulted in reduced proliferation, induction of differentiation, blocked G1/S progression of leukemic cells [87,88], and inhibition of proliferation in human T-cells [89]. Furthermore, treatment with ASOs directed against *MYCN* lead to a decrease of the growth of neuroepithelioma cells and in the tumor mass of xenografts [70,90], reduction of cell proliferation, and induction of cellular differentiation in neuroblastoma [91]. Similarly, antisense *L-Myc* oligonucleotides were shown to inhibit the growth of lung carcinoma cell lines with high *L-Myc* levels, while no effect was observed in cells with low expression of the oncogene [92]. On the other hand, alterations of *c-Myc* expression by treatment of HL-60 human myeloid leukemia cells with ASOs resulted in an augmentation of apoptosis induction [93]. The efficacy of ASOs directed against *c-Myc* and *MYCN* has also been demonstrated in a number of studies performed in animal models including BL [94], B-cell lymphoma [95], breast carcinoma [96], malignant melanoma [51,97], and neuroblastoma [98,99]. In these reports, the treatment with ASOs resulted in tumor cell growth arrest, delay and/or prevention of tumor formation and tumor mass as well as enhanced effects of therapeutic drugs, such as cisplatin, both *in vitro* and *in vivo*.

Melanoma patients have a poor prognosis and respond weakly to conventional chemo- and radiotherapy, mainly since they develop resistance to treatment. Hence, surgery remains the main therapeutic approach for patients with localized melanoma. In this context it is promising that ASOs directed against *c-Myc* have been shown to enhance the efficacy of cisplatin in treatment of melanoma [51,97]. Antisense oligonucleotides directed against other targets such as *Bcl-2*, *XIAP*, and *TGF-β-2* have progressed to clinical trials in the treatment of adult malignancies (for review, see [100]).

5.2. Crossover therapy—peptide nucleic acids

Peptide nucleic acids (PNAs) provide alternatives for cancer therapy due to the superior stability and longer duration of action compared to antisense oligonucleotides. They are DNA analogs, in which the sugar-phosphate backbone has been replaced with a polyamide-(2-aminoethyl) glycine skeleton, providing them with a longer half-life. The PNAs specifically hybridize to DNA and/or RNA in a complementary manner, forming a strong and effective duplex that can inhibit transcription and translation of a target gene [101].

In the past years, the efficacy of PNAs directed against Myc family members has been extensively explored. Downregulation of *c-Myc* expression together with inhibition of a productive cell cycle and apoptosis was observed in BL treated with a 17-mer anti-*c-Myc* PNA covalently linked to a nuclear localization signal [102]. In another study, the pharmacokinetics of a PNA against the Eμ enhancer of the Ig heavy chain gene locus (EμPNA) was assessed in SCID mice where a human tumor xenograft was established by inoculation of BL cells. The data obtained demonstrated a relatively long half-life of the compound in tissues *in vivo* and, in particular, in the BL tumor cells. In addition, low or no toxicity of EμPNA was observed in the treated animals [103].

It has also been shown that antisense MYCN PNA in conjugation with a somatostatin analog resulted in enhanced cellular uptake, thus increasing the efficiency of these molecules [104]. This was confirmed by a substantial growth inhibition of the neuroblastoma cell line IMR32, which overexpresses both *MYCN* and the somatostatin receptor type 2. Additionally, treatment of human neuroblastoma cells with antisense PNAs against *MYCN* resulted in reduction of cellular proliferation and growth arrest in the G1 phase of the cell cycle [105,106]. A novel approach was recently presented by Tonelli et al., in which antisense PNAs designed for targeted inhibition of *MYCN* transcription were conjugated with a peptide containing a nuclear localization signal (NLS) [107]. Administration of antisense NLS-PNA in neuroblastoma cells led to decreased expression of *MYCN* mRNA and protein, resulting in inhibition of cellular proliferation. Taken together these findings are promising for the future development of a PNA-based tumor-specific agent for neuroblastoma with *MYCN* overexpression.

5.3. Interrupting the message with small interfering RNA

RNA interference (RNAi) is the process by which double-stranded RNA silences gene expression, either by inducing the sequence specific degradation of complementary mRNA or by inhibiting translation. During the last few years, this technique has made a considerable impact on the cancer research field. RNAi directed against *Myc* in tumor cells has been employed in studies of senescence, apoptosis, and transformation, leading to the discovery of new *Myc* target genes [108–112]. Wang et al. showed that treatment of MCF-7 breast cancer cells with small interfering RNA (siRNA) against *c-Myc* markedly reduced its expression by up to 80%, decreased cellular growth rate, inhibited colony formation in soft agar, and significantly reduced tumor growth in nude mice. Moreover, depletion of *c-Myc* in this manner promoted apoptosis of MCF-7 cells upon serum withdrawal [113].

A notable drawback of these molecules is their susceptibility to rapid degradation by nucleases, leading to difficulties in compound delivery. However, a recent study showed that this could be greatly improved by fusing multiple siRNAs targeting *Myc*, *Hdm2*, and *VEGF* mRNAs to a positively charged protein covalently linked to a specific antibody. This approach resulted in growth inhibition of melanoma cells that ectopically expressed the particular ligand *in vivo* [114]. In another study, the use of a poly-2-O-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)-oligoribonucleotide (poly-DNP-RNA) was shown to have an *in vivo* silencing effect on the *c-Myc* expression and to decrease cancer cell growth. Compared with other described antisense oligonucleotides this inhibitor

proved to be superior in terms of efficacy and specificity, and it conferred a lower risk of immunogenicity [115]. RNA interference has been explored therapeutically against other targets on both preclinical and clinical basis and the strategy has also been evaluated as a possible therapeutic approach for the treatment of other diseases including viral infections, neurodegenerative diseases, septic shock, and macular degeneration (for reviews see [116–119]).

### 5.4. Attacking translation using phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers

The use of phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMOs) is a novel, non-toxic DNA antisense approach to inhibit the expression of target genes by preventing ribosomal assembly and thereby blocking mRNA translation. Knapp et al. showed that cisplatin resistance could be overcome in a Lewis lung carcinoma model using AVI-4126, a PMO targeting c-Myc [120]. This oligomer was also shown to inhibit tumor growth and to induce apoptosis in murine prostate cancer xenografts [67]. Moreover, safety analysis was conducted in human volunteers after i.v. administration revealing no serious adverse events during the treatment or at the follow-up periods in any subjects [67]. In addition, two clinical studies were performed in parallel to assess the bioavailability of PMO in malignant tumors surgically excised from cancer patients and the plasma pharmacokinetics in human volunteers [121]. The findings from these three studies demonstrated the bioavailability of PMOs in tumor tissue and established the feasibility of using PMO targeting specific genes in human cancer clinical trials.

### 5.5. Silence of the genes—triple helix and tetraplex forming oligonucleotides

Inhibition of Myc expression after treatment with phosphothioate stabilized triple helix forming oligonucleotides (TFOs) has been reported in leukemia and lymphoma cell lines, with concomitant cellular growth arrest and apoptosis [122,123]. TFOs targeting the P2 promoter of the human c-Myc gene was first described by Kim et al. [124]. Downregulation of endogenous c-Myc in prostate and breast cancer cell lines was achieved by using TFOs covalently linked to the DNA-intercalating agent daunomycin [125,126]. This treatment resulted in an increased triplex stability and biological activity of the labeled TFO (i.e. transcription inhibition and reduction of c-Myc promoter activity) without compromising its specificity [126].

TFOs targeting the c-Myc promoter region have been reported to increase the cytotoxicity of gemcitabine, an anti-cancer nucleoside analog, in breast cancer cells [127]. Treatment with TFOs decreased c-Myc expression with 40%, and the combination of both agents resulted in reduction of cell survival and the ability of anchorage-dependent growth.

Radiolabeled TFOs targeting the human MYCN gene have been used in order to evaluate cellular uptake and nuclear localization. However, despite observations that these agents bound selectively to the MYCN sequence in vitro, no specific effects on MYCN gene expression or cellular proliferation were achieved [128].

Our group has investigated the effect of suppression at the transcription initiation level using G-quadruplex-forming oligonucleotides binding to the c-Myc promoter and observed a substantial concentration- and conformation-dependent decrease in growth rate after treatment in human BL cells [129]. Together, these reports corroborate the notion of inhibiting tumor growth by blocking oncogene transcription and propose a rational strategy to target Myc.

### 5.6. Decoy oligonucleotides—tricking Myc away from DNA

One possible means to attenuate the effect of overexpressed transcription factors in tumor cells entails the use of decoy oligonucleotides (DOs), which compete for the binding to DNA. Double-stranded DOs with the Myc consensus site decreased the proliferation of breast tumor cells (MCF-7) and neuroblastoma cells (N2a) in a concentration-dependent manner within 24–48 h of treatment [130].

The oncogenic T-cell factor (TCF) pathway induces the expression of several cancer-related genes and is activated in various types of human cancers [131]. Seki et al. designed DOs based on a consensus beta-catenin/TCF-binding sequence in the cyclin D1 and c-Myc promoters. These TCF decoys significantly inhibited the growth of HCT116 colon cancer cells, but not of the embryonic kidney HEK293 cells, and reduced both TCF activity and transcriptional activation of downstream target genes, including cyclin D1, c-Myc, and matrix metalloproteinase 7. In the search for new targets in tumor treatment, DOs have also been successfully used to inactivate other proteins such as E2F, OTF, and NF-κβ [132,133].

### 5.7. Conquering Myc stability

Myc, as well as several other short-lived transcription factors, is degraded by the tightly controlled process mediated by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Myc mutations leading to increased protein stability, have been identified in a number of human leukemia and lymphomas [134,135]. In breast carcinoma, another reported aberration includes gene amplification of the coding region determinant binding protein (CRD-BP), involved in posttranscriptional regulation of c-Myc mRNA, which in turn results in a prolonged half-life (Table 1) [136]. Therefore, one rational strategy to eradicate Myc is to target its stability or degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system.

Benzodiazepine, a small molecule that was identified in a screen for lupus treatment was found to have anti-proliferative effects on Burkitt’s lymphoma cells. It was further demonstrated that the compound indirectly depleted the c-Myc protein via binding to the mitochondrial F1F0-ATPase, blocking respiratory chain function, and superoxide generation leading to proteasomal degradation of c-Myc [137].

In a recent report, the fusion protein Max-U composed of Max and the U box-type ubiquitin E3-ligase CHIP, was generated with the aim to target c-Myc for proteosomal destruction [138].

Elimination of the oncoprotein by Max-U suppressed colony formation in soft agar and tumor formation in nude mice. Even though this is a promising approach, development of more efficient delivery systems are required to enable its use on a clinical basis.

It was recently reported that regulation of Myc protein turnover by site-specific ubiquitination is required for the switch in the ability of Myc to transcriptionally activate or repress target genes [4]. Thus, inhibition of the E3-ligase HectH9 function or expression may provide a possibility to interfere with Myc's function in tumorigenesis.

The directed destruction of selected molecules such as Myc may substantiate a therapeutic advantage for treatment of human neoplasia. This strategy could also be applied to the eradication of aberrant proteins that accumulate in other diseases.

### 5.8. Immunotherapy—boosting the defense

The development of immunotherapy techniques is becoming increasingly important and is currently being explored for cancer treatment. Ideally, novel agents that specifically target Myc in tumor cells hold the prospect of a more directed approach. Sarkar and Nuchtern evaluated the potential use of MYCN as a specific marker for tumor cells and as a molecular target for vaccine therapy [139]. For this purpose, peripheral blood lymphocytes from a healthy donor and a neuroblastoma patient were exposed to a MYCN-derived peptide. The generated cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs) specifically lysed HLA-matched, MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cells. Moreover, CTL-activity was inhibited by antibodies to CD8 but not to CD4. This study suggests that MYCN-derived peptides can be used as tumor specific antigens and opens the way for potential clinical use of specific CTLs, including the development of tumor vaccines.

### 5.9. Small molecules—ambushing Myc at every level

Small molecules can be used to target Myc at several levels, such as blocking transcription and protein translation, promoting Myc protein degradation, disrupting Myc/Max dimerization, interfering with the interaction of Myc with other factors (e.g., the TRRAP-histone acetylase complex or E3-ligases), or indirectly by inhibiting the function of key Myc target genes (Fig. 2). One strategy to inhibit Myc at the transcription level involves the use of the cationic porphyrin TMPyP4, which acts by blocking G-quadruplex formation resulting in decreased tumor growth rates in xenograft models [66].

Screens of chemical libraries are currently explored for several targets, including p53, Ras, EGFR, and viral proteins. In the case of Myc, the major strategy has been to identify substances that disrupt Myc/Max dimerization. Using the fluorescence resonance energy transfer technique to screen 7000 small organic molecules, Berg et al. identified four compounds that inhibited the formation of Myc/Max complexes [140]. The two most potent inhibitors were effective at micromolar concentrations in inhibiting soft agar growth of Myc-transformed chicken embryo fibroblasts but did not inhibit Src-transformed cells. Another approach to characterize inhibitors of Myc/Max dimerization

was described by Yin et al., who utilized a yeast two-hybrid system to screen a library of 10,000 compounds. This strategy led to the identification of several substances that inhibited Myc transcriptional activity and decreased the growth of Myc-transformed cells. However, no difference in the effect was observed between cells expressing high and low Myc levels. Importantly, some of the compounds inhibited tumor growth *in vivo* [141]. Xu et al. developed a third method based on the design and synthesis of a credit-card library consisting of 285 substances. Several hits were selected based on their disruption of c-Myc/Max interaction, and two out of four compounds evaluated further inhibited Myc-induced oncogenic transformation in cell culture [142]. Lu et al. based their screen of 2800 small molecules on a luciferase reporter gene under the control of the promoter of the MYCN target gene ornithine decarboxylase (*Odc*). Five candidate molecules with an inhibitory activity (*IC*<sub>50</sub> values < 10 μM) specific to MYCN overexpressing cells were identified that currently are undergoing further evaluation [60].

We have employed a cellular screening strategy to identify compounds that inhibit proliferation of tumor cells expressing high but not low c-Myc levels. Two candidate substances, named Myc-pathway-response agents (MYRAs), that enhanced apoptosis and reduced transformation in a c-Myc-dependent manner were found. In contrast to previously described compounds, neither of the substances interfered with Myc/Max dimerization but targeted the Myc pathway at other levels [143]. The MYRAs also inhibited cell proliferation in tumor cells overexpressing MYCN to a greater extent compared to cells with low MYCN levels (M. Vita and M. Henriksson, unpublished results).

The p53 pathway inhibitors RITA and PRIMA, that currently are being used as lead molecules for development of novel cancer therapies, were identified in cellular screens and provide the proof-of principle of the success of this approach [144, 145]. Thus, data from our group as well as from others demonstrate that cellular screens may offer great advantages compared to rational drug design since the desirable biological effects can be achieved by “attacking” the particular target by different means [146]. Collectively, these findings suggest that low molecular weight compounds have the potential to be developed into future drugs for tailored cancer therapy.

### 5.10. Beyond the main path—therapeutic targets that may cooperate with Myc

In addition to the above-mentioned approaches, alternative strategies entail the intervention of other targets or pathways that interact with Myc such as the p53 pathway, the heat shock proteins (HSPs), and histone acetylation/deacetylation. Novel strategies aimed at targeting p53 are currently being explored for cancer therapy [144, 145]. HSPs have been linked to promotion of cell proliferation and inhibition of cell death pathways and also serve as chaperones upon stress conditions such as loss of p53 function or c-Myc overexpression [147, 148]. Aberrant expression of HSPs has been observed in a wide range of tumors and hence HSP inhibitors such as 17AAG are being explored for cancer treatment [36, 148]. Additionally, modulators of histone

acetylases and deacetylases alone or in combination with other
chemotherapeutic drugs may offer an effective therapeutic strat-
egy to treat cancer patients [68,149–152]. Thus, these and other
therapies may be used in cocktails with Myc-targeting therapies
for cancer treatment.

### 6. Deciphering the Myc code

Several therapeutic strategies are available for cancer treat-
ment today. Commonly used treatment includes surgery, radia-
tion, cytotoxic drugs, and hormone therapy. Chemotherapeutic
drugs often lack selectivity and usually cause severe toxicity.
Despite better treatment strategies and increased recovery rates
of cancer patients during the last decade, toxicity is still the
dose-limiting factor for cancer therapy [153]. Many investigators
and pharmaceutical companies worldwide are searching for the
“magic bullet” that would selectively cure cancer while eliciting
minimum toxicity. In addition, more efficient delivery systems
to target the tumor cells are needed.

Myc proteins are key regulators of cell proliferation, apop-
tosis, and differentiation. Deregulation of *Myc* genes contributes
to the genesis of a wide spectrum of human tumors and Myc is
therefore an attractive target for cancer treatment. Identification
of selective inhibitors of Myc may be important for the devel-
opment of more specific and less toxic therapeutic agents. Such
drugs could be used alone or in combination with conventional
or novel drugs. We have discussed several promising strategies
directed towards Myc inhibition and/or activation that are cur-
rently being explored. These and future approaches will give
new insights to the role of Myc in tumorigenesis and may pro-
vide the basis for development of novel therapies against human
cancer. New avenues for future progress will also open once we
break the enigmatic Myc Code.
