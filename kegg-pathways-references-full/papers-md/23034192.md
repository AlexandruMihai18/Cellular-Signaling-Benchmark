**ABSTRACT**

Over the past decade, the Hippo signaling cascade has been linked to organ size regulation in mammals. Indeed, modulation of the Hippo pathway can have potent effects on cellular proliferation and/or apoptosis and a deregulation of the pathway often leads to tumor development. Importantly, emerging evidence indicates that the Hippo pathway can modulate its effects on tissue size by the regulation of stem and progenitor cell activity. This role has recently been associated with the central position of the pathway in sensing spatiotemporal or mechanical cues, and translating them into specific cellular outputs. These results provide an attractive model for how the Hippo cascade might sense and transduce cellular ‘neighborhood’ cues into activation of tissue-specific stem or progenitors cells. A further understanding of this process could allow the development of new therapies for various degenerative diseases and cancers. Here, we review current and emerging data linking Hippo signaling to progenitor cell function.

of the TEAD/TEF family by retaining YAP in the cytosol [4]. Taken together these studies unveiled the now well-recognized mechanism of dynamic nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling regulating YAP and TAZ localization as well as transcriptional activity.

The finding that YAP65 was able to interact with the transcription factor Runx2 initially revealed the role of YAP as a transcriptional coregulator [5,6]. Since then, the list of transcription factors capable of interacting with YAP and/or TAZ has grown substantially and includes: Smads, Pax3, Tbx5, TTF-1, PPARγ and p73 [4,7–14,26]. However, despite the growing number of transcriptional partners, only the transcription enhancer factors 1–4 (TEF/TEAD 1–4) have been shown to mediate the growth-promoting function of YAP so far [15–19] and are considered to be the primary transcriptional partners of YAP and TAZ.

The *Drosophila* Hippo cascade was identified mainly via mosaic genetic screens for mutations leading to organomegaly phenotypes (reviewed in [20]). The YAP/TAZ ortholog Yorkie was identified as an interacting partner of the Warts kinase (ortholog of mammalian Lats), which was shown to phosphorylate Yorkie and induce its cytoplasmic retention, thus inhibiting its activity as a mediator of tissue growth [19]. The Hippo pathway is also well conserved between flies and humans at the functional level. An active Hippo pathway triggers the phosphorylation of YAP/TAZ leading to its cytosolic sequestration by the 14-3-3 family members [21,22] thus inactivating the YAP/TAZ complex’s transcriptional coregulatory activities (Fig. 1). High cell-density activates the Hippo pathway kinases and promotes the phosphorylation of YAP on serine 127 leading to its nuclear export and growth inhibition. Conversely, a lower cellular density favors the proliferative role of nuclear YAP when the protein remains un-phosphorylated [22]. The Hippo pathway can also regulate YAP activity by controlling its degradation [23].

In this review, we will summarize the current knowledge about the role of the Hippo pathway in mammals with a particular emphasis on embryonic, adult and cancer stem cells.

### 2. The core Hippo pathway and its extended family in mammals

#### 2.1. Core Hippo pathway components: signal transduction

The core of the mammalian Hippo pathway is composed of two kinase complexes: the MST1-2/Sav1 complex and the Lats/MOB complex. The mammalian Sav1 protein (hSavaldor1, WW45) interacts with the MST kinases (Mammalian Ste20-like kinases) and is required for MST kinase activation [27]. Two MST kinase isoforms are expressed in mammals, MST1 and 2 (also known as STK4 and STK3, respectively), while only one isoform (Hippo) exists in *Drosophila*. Similar to its function in the fly, the MST/Sav1 complex activates the large tumor suppressor kinase Lats (ortholog of the *Drosophila* kinase Warts) [28]. In mammals, there are 2 isoforms of Lats kinases (Lats1 and Lats2), which interact with the scaffold proteins MOB1A/MOB1B [29]. The two mammalian MOB isoforms are orthologs of the single *Drosophila* Warts scaffold protein Mats (Mob-as-tumor-suppressor). MOB1 proteins interact with and activate Lats1/2, which in turn phosphorylate the transcriptional coregulators YAP and TAZ [25,30].

#### 2.2. The upstream transmembrane and membrane-associated components: sensing

Light is being shed on the upstream components of the mammalian Hippo pathway, which mainly play the role of sensors for the cellular surrounding milieu. A number of transmembrane proteins identified as upstream Hippo pathway components in flies possess ortholog(s) in mammals although some are not found in higher-level organisms. For example, flies, but not mammals, express the protein Dachs which is an unconventional myosin acting as a downstream component of the fly cadherin Fat signaling pathway and has an inhibitory effect on Warts (Lats) activity [31,32].

In flies, activation of the transmembrane cadherin Fat (FAT4 in mammals) by its transmembrane ligand Dachsous (Dachsous 1 and 2 in mammals; Dchs1/2) inactivates the Hippo signaling pathway [31,33–37] by preventing the accumulation of Dachs at the membrane [31,32] thus favoring its interaction with the Hippo kinase Warts, and Dachs subsequent degradation [34]. Deletion of Fat in the mouse mammary epithelial cell line NOG8 leads to the aberrant activation of YAP and drives subcutaneous tumor formation by this otherwise non-tumorigenic cell line in allograft experiments in nude mice [38]. However, the absence of organomegaly in the Fat4 and Dchs1 mutant mice suggests that the Hippo signaling pathway is not regulated by the Dchs1-Fat4 signaling pathway in all mammalian tissues [39,40].

Consistently with the well-established role of the Hippo pathway in cell–cell contact inhibition, the tight junction-related Crumbs cell polarity complex (composed of PALS1, Inad and angiomotins (AMOT, AMOTL1 and AMOTL2)) as well as the adherens junction proteins (E-Cadherin and α-catenin) have been shown to sequester the transcriptional coregulators YAP/TAZ at sites of cell–cell adhesion, thus preventing YAP/TAZ nuclear localization and inhibiting their pro-proliferative and anti-apoptotic transcriptional activities [41–44]. Also, Ajuba, a member of the Zyxin family of LIM proteins involved in transducing signals from sites of cell adhesion to the nucleus during endodermal development [45], was recently identified as a modulator of the Hippo pathway [46]. Recently, a genetic screen in flies identified another LIM protein, Zyx102 (Zyxin; Zyx), as a modulator of the Hippo pathway: loss of Zyxin reduces Yorkie activity and organ growth [47]. Despite the presence of a C-terminal LIM domain in both Ajuba and Zyxin, these proteins modulate Hippo signaling in a different although synergistic manner. While Ajuba inhibits Warts/Lats activation, Zyxin appears to favor its degradation via a Fat/Dachs-dependent mechanism [47]. Considering that the mammalian Zyxin proteins are linking the effects of mechanical strain to cell behavior, it will be of importance to study their effect on Hippo signaling in vivo.

Other newly characterized Hippo pathway regulators are the CD44 transmembrane receptor [48], the WW-domain containing protein Kibra [49–52] and the phosphatase PP2A [53,54]. CD44 (which is absent in flies) has been shown to promote cell–cell contact inhibition by recruiting and inactivating the Neurofibromin 2 tumor suppressor gene product, Merlin (NF2/Merlin), in response to cell–cell contact [55,56]. NF2/Merlin, a FERM-domain containing protein that also interacts with FERMD6 (mammalian homolog of the *Drosophila* protein expanded regulating Hippo kinases downstream of Fat), was recently shown to act synergistically with Kibra to promote the phosphorylation of Lats1/2 (homologs of Wts) [51]. Also, the phosphatase PP2A was recently shown to dephosphorylate the Mst1/2 kinases as well of the coregulator YAP [53,54] while, the scaffold protein Ras-Association Domain Family (RASSF1A) was shown to activate the Mst1/2 kinases [57] by preventing their dephosphorylation by PP2A [53]. Interestingly, while the Ras effector protein RASSF1A (which has the highest homology with the fly protein dRASSF) activates the Mst kinases, another Ras effector family member, RASSF6 was shown to bind to Mst2 and antagonizes Hippo signaling [58].

In addition, the *Drosophila* protein Myopic (Mop) has been identified as a regulator of the transcriptional activity of Yorkie [59]. Mop is essential for EGFR signaling, both in vivo and in cultured

Fig. 1. Simplified schematic of the mammalian Hippo signaling cascade. The adherens junction (AJ) and tight junction (TJ)/polarity complexes modulate the Hippo pathway activity in response to cell–cell contact cues by altering the subcellular localization of the transcriptional coregulators YAP/TAZ. Conditions of increased cellular density (*i.e.* more AJs) limit stem cells expansion by sequestering phosphorylated YAP at the membrane and protecting it from de-phosphorylation by PP2A. In a corresponding manner, conditions associated with low cell density lead to elevated nuclear YAP and activation of its transcriptional programs (mainly proliferative and antiapoptotic) *via* binding to transcription factors. Signals leading to the activation of the core kinases Mst1/2 and Lats1/2 culminate in the phosphorylation of YAP/TAZ, which leads to their cytosolic localization. In addition, RASSF1A and Kibra can activate MST1/2 while RASSF6 has an inhibitory effect. Ajuba, a member of the Zyxin family of LIM proteins that is also recruited to the cell membrane AJ complex can inhibit Lats1/2 activity. The detailed mechanisms responsible for the nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling and the complete list of compartment-specific interactors of YAP/TAZ have yet to be fully elucidated. Dashed lines represent unknown mechanism.

cells and promotes EGFR signaling by facilitating its progression through the endocytic pathway and promoting signaling from internalized EGFR [60]. Mop regulates the Hippo pathway output directly by sequestering Yorkie in endosomal compartments [59]. The role of the mammalian homolog of Mop, the catalytically inactive His-domain protein tyrosine phosphatase gene (*HD-PTP* or *PTPN23*) [61], in Hippo signaling and/or EGFR signaling remains to be established. On the other hand, the Ste20-like kinase Tao-1 was recently shown, in both flies and human cells, to promote the Hippo

pathway activation by phosphorylating the Hippo/MST kinases [62,63]. More recently, the cell adhesion molecule echinoid (Ed), antagonist of the Drosophila EGFR signaling, has been shown to regulate organ size *via* the Hippo–Salvador pathway. Ed interacts with Sav1 in a cell–cell contact dependent manner and the loss of Ed results in decreased levels of phosphorylated Yorkie and increased transcriptional activity leading to tissue overgrowth [64].

With the rapid progression of our understanding of the Hippo pathway in flies, one of the current challenges for the

mammalian Hippo pathway is to validate and compare these observations in mammalian systems *in vivo* to gain deeper insights into stem cell biology, organ size regulation and cancer.

### 2.3. Downstream transcriptional regulation: biological integration

An important difference that adds a level of complexity to the transcriptional outputs of the mammalian Hippo pathway is the presence of two different, yet similar, orthologs of the coregulator Yorkie (YAP and TAZ) in addition to the four mammalian orthologs of the transcription factor Scalloped (TEF/TEAD1-4). The TEAD transcription factors are widely expressed in most tissues and organs. At least one TEAD isoform is expressed in every adult tissue in mammals, with some tissues expressing up to all four isoforms. However, each TEAD isoform displays a specific expression pattern depending on the tissue and/or developmental stage [65,66]. The preferential partnership of YAP/TAZ-TEAD transcriptional regulation is well recognized; however, YAP and TAZ regulate the transcriptional activity of numerous other transcription factors, which greatly increases the number of genes whose expression can be specifically regulated by these factors in response to Hippo pathway inactivation thereby suggesting the existence of context-specific YAP/TAZ transcriptional programs.

The Hippo pathway relies on the specific WW-domain/PPxY domain interactions. Furthermore, the occurrence of multiple variants of YAP, bearing either one or two WW-domains, implies that some effects of YAP could be dependent on the level of expression of each isoform regulated in a tissue-specific manner. The WW-domain/PPxY domain interactions appear to be an important feature of the pathway and could help unraveling new interactions regulating the pathway in a context-specific manner (reviewed in [67,68]).

While the phosphorylation-dependent nuclear export mechanism restricts the levels of YAP/TAZ proteins in the nucleus, and subsequently their transcriptional activity, it also promotes YAP/TAZ cytoplasmic localization. The roles of YAP and TAZ in the cytosol are yet poorly defined, but it has been reported that while in the cytosol, YAP and TAZ can modulate other signaling cascades/pathways by interacting with or regulating the expression of key components of those pathways. For example, the Hippo pathway can restrict the activity of the WNT pathway by promoting the interaction between phosphorylated TAZ and Dvl2 as well as by promoting the interaction between phosphorylated YAP/TAZ and β-catenin thus inducing their cytosolic retention and decreasing expression of WNT target genes [69,70]. On the other hand, the Wnt pathway *via* binding of β-catenin/TCF4 complexes to a transcriptional enhancer in the first intron enhances YAP expression transcriptionally in colorectal cancer cells [71]. The interactions between Hippo pathway and WNT pathway are highly context- and tissue-specific as demonstrated by the potentiation of Wnt signaling by the Hippo pathway in the heart [72,73]. Hippo signaling can also inhibit the Transforming Growth Factor (TGF)β/SMAD signaling pathway by promoting TAZ phosphorylation and sequestration of the Smad2/3-phospho-TAZ complex in the cytosol [14]. Similarly, YAP and TAZ can differentially modulate the activity of the TGFβ/SMAD signaling pathway in a context- and SMAD isoform-specific manner [14,41,74]. It is crucial to fully understand the roles of the coregulator YAP and TAZ in all cellular compartments and further studies are required to identify their specific cytosolic versus nuclear roles and crosstalk with other pathways in various physiological contexts.


### 3. Hippo signaling in mammals: initial insights from mouse models

Loss-of-function mouse models of several of the Hippo pathway components (namely NF2, WW45, MST1/2, LATS1/2, YAP and TAZ) all display embryonic or perinatal lethality phenotypes (either complete or partial), thereby highlighting the essential role of the pathway in early embryonic development in mammals as well as in organ size regulation and homeostasis [75–82].

Based on the phenotypes of the null mice, the physiological roles of the mammalian YAP and TAZ seem to diverge. YAP-deficient mice display a developmental arrest at embryonic day 8 as a result of multiple extraembryonic structure defects (yolk sac vasculogenesis, chorioallantoic attachment, accompanied by a lack of embryonic axis elongation). In contrast, some TAZ-deficient mice are viable (sub-mendelian ratio), but they progressively develop a polycystic kidney-like accompanied by an emphysema-like condition during adulthood [80–82]. The double knockout mice for YAP and TAZ display earlier embryonic lethality phenotype than the YAP null mice. The YAP/TAZ double mutant embryos die before the morula stage at embryonic day 2 due to a pre-implantation defect [83]. This suggests that while both YAP and TAZ are required for proper implantation, each factor plays a specific and only partially overlapping role during mouse embryogenesis. Therefore, an important biological question remains regarding the extent of the functional overlap of YAP and TAZ *in vivo*, which is a poorly explored facet of the Hippo pathway.

Due to the embryonic or perinatal lethality phenotypes of the Hippo pathway knockout mice, most advances in understanding the roles of the mammalian Hippo pathway in adult mice have resulted from the generation of tissue-specific (constitutive or inducible) conditionally targeted mouse models.


### 4. Hippo signaling in development and embryonic stem cells

The high level of expression of YAP and TEAD2 in embryonic stem (ES) cells, neural cells, as well as in hematopoietic stem cells initially placed these genes in a general ‘stemness’ transcriptional signature [84]. More recently, modulation of the Hippo signaling pathway has been linked to the maintenance of pluripotency in mammalian ES cells in culture [14,85] and the modulation of TEAD4, LATS2 or YAP expression leading to the inactivation of the Hippo pathway has been involved in the process of cell fate determination in early mouse embryos [83].

The Hippo pathway interplays with important pathways linked to ES cells pluripotency, such as the TGFβ/Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) or Leukemia Inhibitory Factor (LIF) pathways both *in vivo* and in culture [14,41,74,86]. In cultured ES cells, elevated YAP expression is linked to pluripotency, while its down-regulation is associated with differentiation [85]. While the total level of YAP protein is decreased during ES cell differentiation, the phosphorylation of YAP on serine 127 is increased resulting in a reduced nuclear YAP environment allowing for the differentiation of ES cells. Additionally, differentiated ES cells (reduced nuclear YAP1) have a significantly lower proportion of YAP recruited to TEAD binding sites in the genome in comparison to pluripotent ES cells (high nuclear YAP1) [85]. Moreover YAP is activated in induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and increases reprogramming efficiency, while simultaneously inhibiting differentiation in mouse ES cells (mESCs) when ectopically overexpressed [85]. The YAP-TEAD complex binds to and promotes the transcription of important “stemness” genes (namely Oct3/4, Sox2, Polycomb Group (PcG) targets, LIF targets, Nanog, and BMP signaling targets) specifically in mESCs over mature cells. Thus, in ES cells, YAP and TAZ promote

stemness in vitro indirectly by mediating BMP/TGF-β transcriptional activity as well as directly by regulating the expression of expression of genes responsible for the maintenance of pluripotency [85,86].

### 5. Hippo signaling in mammalian stem cell compartments

#### 5.1. Liver

Similarly to its role in flies, inhibition of the Hippo pathway induces organomegaly phenotypes in mice. Several groups have reported an increase in liver size following liver-specific genetic manipulations mimicking inactivation of the Hippo pathway in mice. This was achieved either *via* an inducible overexpression of YAP in the adult mouse liver [24,25] or by liver-specific ablation of the MST1 and MST2 kinases [87–89], the salvador homolog WW45 [88,90] or the tumor suppressor NF2/Merlin [91,92]. While the Hippo-related hepatomegaly phenotypes may seem similar at first glance, several key differences exist between the models.

Massive periportal accumulation of small cells with the features of putative bipotential liver stem cells, called oval cells (OCs), have been reported following the deletion of the MST1 and MST2 kinases, WW45/Sav1 and NF2/Merlin [87–91]. However, in all cases where OC expansion was reported, the observed effects reflect a genetic manipulation at the level of the whole organ. The systems used were either the albumin-Cre (deleting during embryonic development) or the tamoxifen-inducible CAGGCre-ER (deleting during neonatal/adult stages) which can mark both OC and hepatocyte lineages. This raises the question of whether the OC expansion observed following Hippo pathway activation in liver is driven by a cell autonomous effect in the OCs themselves or by a non-cell autonomous effect triggered by the hepatocyte lineages. Albumin (Alb)-Cre driven deletion of WW45 triggers an expansion of the OC compartment without affecting significantly the Hippo pathway components in hepatocytes, which points to the existence of an OC intrinsic effect [88,90]. However, deletion of MST1/2 leads to hepatocyte proliferation without much effect on cells with the appearance of OCs. Future experiments should aim at performing genetic manipulations in specific cellular compartments to further define this mechanism.

Both studies describing the enlargement of the liver following Alb-Cre driven NF2 deletion in mice reported a massive expansion of an undifferentiated cell population in the periportal area, either referred to as OCs [91] or as bile duct hamartomas surrounded by cytokeratin positive biliary epithelial cells [92]. In both cases, the lesions appeared during early developmental stages and progressively led to the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in ≥7-month-old mice. One of the major differences between these two studies resides in the mechanism proposed for the effects of the liver-specific NF2 deletion.

Benhamouche et al. [91] reported a partial rescue of the liver hepatomegaly phenotype following 10 days treatment of the Alb-Cre conditional NF2 mice with a highly specific inhibitor of the tyrosine kinase receptor EGFR. This treatment induced a significant decrease in the liver lesion size as well as in the liver weight/body weight ratio. This interesting finding suggests that EGFR activity is involved in the OC expansion following NF2 deletion in Alb-Cre targeted cells. However, one surprising conclusion of the Benhamouche study was that the effects observed were independent of the Hippo signaling cascade and YAP. Yet, previous links between YAP and EGFR signaling have already been established which suggests a more complex and potentially tissue-specific interplay of the Hippo and EGFR pathways. For example, YAP and TAZ interact with NHERF1/EBP50 and NHERF2, respectively, which are scaffolds for membrane tyrosine kinase receptors such as EGFR and PDGFR

[3,93,94]. In addition, the YAP target genes AREG and EREG are ligands for the EGFR family [95,96] and several novel modulators of the Hippo pathway in flies, notably Mop and Ed, are also involved in the regulation of EGFR signaling [60,97].

Furthermore, Zhang et al. [92] reported completely different observations using the same Alb-Cre deletion model. They reported a complete rescue of the NF2 deletion-induced hepatomegaly phenotype by the concomitant deletion of YAP. In that study, the heterozygous deletion of YAP was sufficient to prevent the hepatomegaly phenotype induced by NF2 deletion, which is interesting considering that heterozygous deletion of YAP is usually inconsequential in a wild-type background [92]. The albumin-Cre driven deletion of YAP alone, while not affecting liver size, resulted in an impaired bile ducts development and a deficient liver function [92]. The reasons to explain these seemingly conflicting observations are yet unclear.

In the Benhamouche study, no histological detection of YAP was performed on the lesions, and the conclusion that the effect is Hippo-independent was drawn from cell culture studies using NF2 null primary OCs or hepatoblasts (HBs) isolated from the early lesions of the Alb-Cre NF2 floxed mice. They reported that in cultured NF2 null OCs, the reintroduction of exogenous NF2 did not alter the nuclear localization of YAP nor decreased the expression of the YAP target genes Sox4, Birc2 and Birc3. Furthermore, the shRNA-mediated knockdown of YAP did not change the proliferation rate of cultured OCs. YAP target genes (Sox4, Birc2 and Birc) were only modestly changed following the Ad-Cre mediated *in vitro* deletion in HBs isolated from NF2 floxed mice. In addition, the *in vitro* deletion of NF2 did not alter the constitutive nuclear localization of YAP nor NF2 phosphorylation levels in HBs. Taken together with the Zhang study, these findings reveal our preliminary understanding of the full set of pathways that NF2 regulates and that impinge on YAP function.

The current data suggest that an active Hippo pathway is required to restrict hepatocytes and OC overproliferation. Whether different types of liver damage or localization of the primary lesion will trigger OCs contribution to the repair process is yet to be determined. In addition, the position of the interaction nexus between various signaling pathways and the Hippo pathway may play a role in the type of regenerative response produced. For example, the loss of NF2/Merlin expression in the adult liver (either *via* Mx1-Cre or Ad-Cre mediated deletion) is insufficient to induce liver OCs expansion without the additional stress of a partial hepatectomy. On the contrary, the deletion of Mst1/2 and WW45 are sufficient in themselves to drive OC expansion [91,92].

This suggests that NF2/Merlin could be playing a more limited role in maintaining OC quiescence than other components of the Hippo pathway, such as YAP. This seems likely since the chances of a compensatory ‘correction’ event or the existence of a protection mechanism against OC over-proliferation (and HCC) increase with the position of the genetic alteration in the pathway. Indeed, the more upstream the dysregulation in the Hippo pathway, the higher are the chances of a compensatory event at one level or the other before reaching the transcriptional output involving YAP. Thus, although each component may impact the quiescence of the OCs to a different degree, taken as a whole, these studies strongly establish the central role played by the Hippo pathway in the maintenance of quiescence of the liver stem cell pool and adult hepatocytes.

#### 5.2. Intestine

Akin to its role in the liver, overexpression of YAP in the adult intestine was shown to induce an expansion of the undifferentiated progenitor compartment, although causing no obvious enlargement of organ size [24]. Overexpression of activated YAP led to

Notch-dependent hyperplasia of the small intestine epithelium with loss of the terminally differentiated cell lineages [24].

Cai et al. demonstrated that although YAP activity was dispensable for normal intestinal homeostasis, it was required for the regeneration of the intestinal epithelium following dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced injury [98]. They reported that the regenerating crypts of control mice expressed highly elevated levels of YAP in both cytosolic and nuclear compartments following DSS-induced injury. In contrast, the Villin-Cre floxed YAP mice (intestinal epithelium-specific deletion of YAP) failed to regenerate a functional intestinal epithelium. The complete loss of intestinal crypts in the Villin-Cre YAP conditional knockout mice after DSS injury led to a rapid decrease in body weight resulting in death, showing the crucial role of YAP for the regeneration of damaged intestinal epithelium [98].

The use of Villin-Cre to delete Salvador (aka Sav1, WW45) resulted in induced hyperplasia of the intestinal epithelium in both the small intestine and colon. The enlarged crypts of the Villin-Cre Sav1-floxed mice displayed a marked increase in cellular proliferation accompanied by an increase in nuclear YAP protein levels. Furthermore, the intestinal phenotype of the Villin-Cre Sav1-deficient mice was completely rescued by biallelic loss of YAP [98]. In a similar manner to the adult mice, the intestinal epithelium of the Sav1-null embryos was also shown to be hyperplastic and displayed immature differentiation, characterized by the loss of differentiated cell types, compared to littermate controls at 17.5 dpc [75].

Recently, Zhou et al. reported that deletion of Mst1 and Mst2 in the intestine induces hyperproliferation of undifferentiated cells and the almost complete loss of the secretory cell populations (namely goblet cells, enteroendocrine cells, and Paneth cells) throughout the small and large intestine [99]. In the Mst1/2-null small intestine and colon, YAP expression is detectable at high levels throughout the epithelium and is almost exclusively nuclear. This is contrary to the wild-type intestine where YAP expression is restricted almost exclusively to the crypts where it is largely localized in the cytosol [99]. In a similar manner to the effect of YAP loss in the Villin-Cre Sav1-floxed mice, loss of YAP rescued the hyperplasia induced by the deletion of Mst1/2. In addition, the loss of only one allele of YAP was sufficient to entirely rescue hyperproliferation and loss of differentiation resulting from Mst1/2 deletion [99].

The contribution of YAP to the proliferative capacity of the intestinal stem cells and transient amplifying compartments during normal mucosal turnover appears minimal or nonexistent [98,99]. In accordance with this, the phenotypes of the Villin-Cre driven Mst1/Mst2 and Salvador intestinal knockouts, which display a moderate YAP-dependent expansion and hyperproliferation of intestinal crypt cells, suggest that in the normal intestinal epithelium the Hippo pathway is actively restricting YAP nuclear localization and transcriptional activity to prevent overproliferation and cancer [98,99]. Indeed, the Villin-Cre Sav1-floxed mice develop distal colonic polyps at more than 12 months of age, similarly to but not as strongly as the Villin-Cre MST1/2-floxed mice reported to develop adenomas of the distal colon as early as 13 weeks of age, which is the median survival age in this model [98,99].

### 5.3. Skin

Similarly to other mammalian epithelial tissues, the skin undergoes continuous regeneration cycles throughout the life and this process has recently been associated with the Hippo pathway. Lee et al. reported that the Sav1 (WW45) null embryos displayed a thickening of the epidermal layer of the skin, which showed increased proliferation, progenitor expansion, decreased apoptosis, and absence of differentiation (lack of stratification and lack of expression of differentiation markers) [75]. Consistently, forced expression of YAP in the skin driven by the skin-progenitor specific Keratin14 (K14) promoter resulted in the thickening of the epidermal layer, amplification of epidermal progenitors and decrease in differentiation [54,100]. Reciprocally, skin specific deletion of YAP impaired epidermis formation. The K14-cre YAP cKO mouse embryos were all born without skin covering the distal limbs, eyes or ears and displayed a complete absence of skin barrier in these anatomical regions [54]. It has been shown that α-catenin, a component of adherens junctions (AJs) and a known tumor suppressor in epithelial tissue, is an upstream negative regulator of YAP in the epidermis. The overgrowth phenotypes induced by deletion of α-catenin in the skin and developing brain prompted the hypothesis that AJs could act as molecular biosensors of cellular density and position [101,102] and led to the cellular “crowd control” model. This model stipulates that the increase in cellular density is sensed by an increase in the number of AJs, which limits stem cell expansion by activating the Hippo cascade and repressing YAP activity. Conversely, a decrease in cellular density, as in a growing embryo or after wound injury, leads to the translocation of YAP into the nucleus and increased stem cell proliferation. As a result of defects in this molecular circuitry (e.g., in instances where α-catenin is deleted, 14-3-3 inactivated or YAP overexpressed) hyper-proliferation of undifferentiated progenitors and tumors may occur [54].

The role of YAP in mouse keratinocytes was shown to be mediated by the TEAD transcription factors both in cell culture experiments [54,100] as well as *in vivo* [54]. A single point mutation in YAP (serine 79 to alanine) prevents the binding of YAP to the TEAD transcription factors. Replacing the endogenous YAP with the YAP-S79A isoform in mouse skin is sufficient to recapitulate the phenotype observed in the K14cre YAP cKO embryos, showing that the effect of YAP on proliferation in the skin is heavily TEAD-dependent [54].

Interestingly, while liver- and intestine-specific deletion of Mst1/2 recapitulate the effect of YAP overexpression, the skin-specific deletion of the Mst1/2 kinases, which require binding to Salvador/WW45 for their activation, produced no effect in mice up to 5 months of age [54]. This lack of effect on the Hippo pathway activity following deletion of the Mst1/2 kinases was also previously observed in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) [89]. This variability in the effect of Mst1/2 deletion on the Hippo pathway activity suggests that although well-conserved evolutionarily, the Hippo pathway is likely to display several tissue/context-specific functions and that the role of WW45/Salvador could be broader than its function as defined in the Hippo pathway.

### 5.4. Nervous system

Neural progenitor cells are responsible for generating the multitude of cell types composing the mature central nervous system (CNS). YAP is expressed in neural progenitor cells in mouse, Zebrafish, frog, and chick neural tubes, and co-localizes with Sox2, a neural progenitor marker [84,103,104]. The massive expansion of neural progenitors observed in conditions where the Hippo pathway is inactivated (loss of Mst1/2 or Lats1/2, or overexpression of YAP) is partially due to an upregulation of cell cycle and stemness genes, and a concomitant decrease in key differentiation genes. Inversely, an active Hippo pathway (mimicked by YAP loss-of-function models) leads to an increase in cell death and in premature neuronal differentiation in chick neural tube [103]. In Xenopus laevis, overexpression of YAP induces the expansion of Sox2+ neural plate progenitors and Pax3+ neural crest progenitors and maintains them in an undifferentiated state for a longer period. This effect is accompanied by a decreased expression of differentiation markers [104]. Interestingly, the effects of YAP overexpression already

display tissue-specificity within the embryonic ectoderm since not all the progenitor types or Pax3 expressing cells were expanded following YAP overexpression [104].

YAP is also highly expressed in cerebellar granule neural precursors (CGNPs) as well as in tumor-propagating cancer stem-like cells in the perivascular niche [105]. Indeed, high level of YAP expression in CGNPs is associated with medulloblastomas, a brain tumor common in children, which is characterized by an expansion of cells with a CGNP-like phenotype [105]. Medulloblastomas formation and CGNPs expansion are both dependent on activation of the Sonic hedgehog pathway (Shh). Shh was shown to induce the nuclear localization of YAP, which promotes the proliferation of the CGNPs, placing YAP at the intersection of multiple developmental pro-proliferative signaling cascades (such as, but not limited to, Shh and Notch) that were classically thought to act in a parallel fashion to control brain development in mammals [105].

### 5.5. Heart

Contrarily to other tissues such as liver, the role of Hippo signaling in the heart is just beginning to be delineated. It was recently shown that a cardiac-specific activation of the Hippo pathway (either following deletion of WW45, MST1/2 or LATS2 or following the overexpression of YAP) results in embryos displaying a cardiomegaly phenotype due to an increase in cardiomyocyte number and proliferation. Conversely, the cardiac-specific deletion of YAP leads to myocardial hypoplasia [72,73,106]. Genetic studies revealed that YAP interacts with β-catenin to intensify Wnt signaling output, a well-known promoter of stemness and proliferation in the heart, and the loss of β-catenin in WW45/SAV1 null mouse hearts suppressed this overgrowth phenotype [73]. Furthermore, in an independent study, Xin et al. also reported similar findings and proposed a model in which YAP activates the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) pathway, resulting in the inactivation of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β) leading to inactivation the Wnt degradation complex [72]. Consistently with these results, the small molecule BIO, a GSK-3β inhibitor, and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt signaling pathway were also shown to promote cardiomyocyte proliferation [107,108]. Taken together, these studies show that YAP promotes embryonic and neonatal cardiomyocyte proliferation *in vitro* and *in vivo*. The proliferative role of YAP in the heart is attributable to its interaction with β-catenin in the nucleus, directly promoting a stemness gene expression program, while indirectly intensifying Wnt signaling output via the IGF pathway [72,73,106,107,109].

### 5.6. Cancer

Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are instrumental for the maintenance of the tumor niche and are the driving force of tumor initiation and disease progression. Being more difficult to eliminate as the tumor grade increases, CSCs are thought to be responsible for most cancer relapses and are the target to aim for in order to successfully eradicate the tumor and halt disease progression [110].

Recently, *via* profiling of human breast cancer tumors of epithelial origin, Cordenonsi et al. [110] elegantly showed that TAZ acts a molecular determinant of the biological properties associated with breast CSCs. They showed that high levels of nuclear YAP/TAZ correlated with an increased histological grade of the tumors and, consequently, number of CSCs. Moreover, TAZ levels are enriched in prospective CSCs and activation of TAZ in the more differentiated non-CSC tumor cells could promote the reactivation of their self-renewal potential [110].

Furthermore, they showed that the delocalization of the cell polarity protein Scribble from the cellular membranes resulted in increased TAZ activity levels, by inhibition of the Hippo kinases, and promoted a CSC-like state. This study links basolateral cell polarity complexes, Hippo signaling and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and provides a plausible explanation to the current conundrum regarding the role of TAZ in promoting EMT in high-grade tumors [110].

## 6. Conclusions

It is now becoming clearer that activation of the Hippo pathway promotes quiescence or differentiation at the expense of proliferation in embryonic and adult epithelial tissues. It is interesting to speculate that modulation of Hippo pathway activity could be exploited to increase the regenerative potential of terminally differentiated organs with poor intrinsic regenerative capacity such as brain and neuronal tissue, or to promote CSCs differentiation to halt tumor progression. There is potential for therapeutic intervention targeting the Hippo pathway in mammals, although a better knowledge of the molecular mechanisms and other interplaying pathways is a prerequisite. Considering the recent findings involving the Hippo pathway in the transduction of signals from the cellular environment, the *in vitro* recapitulation of the *in vivo* conditions *via* 3D culture models or the development of coating matrices recapitulating the physical properties of the desired tissue-specific niche will be instrumental to a successful manipulation of the Hippo pathway in a stem cell therapy-oriented manner. One of the main challenges will be to achieve a transient inhibition of the pathway activity in the cultured stem cells to produce expansion and maintain pluripotency while permitting the targeted differentiation in the proper cell type upon removal of the signal and cell transplantation. In addition, the transient nature of the Hippo inhibitory signal intervention is of crucial importance to avoid and impairment of differentiation as well as the malignant transformation associated with prolonged YAP activation in undifferentiated progenitors.
