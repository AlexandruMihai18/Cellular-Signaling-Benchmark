**Abstract.** The last decade led to the discovery and characterization of several human β-defensins. Analysis of genomic information indicates that the number of β-defensin-like molecules encoded by the human genome may number in the tens. Growing interest in β-defensins steadily enhances our knowledge about various aspects of their gene location, expression patterns and the transcription factors involved in their regulation *in vivo*. The hallmark property of β-defensins, their antimicrobial activity, is clearly only the tip of the iceberg in the extensive network of inter-relations within the immune system in which these peptides function. Structural studies of β-defensins provide the molecular basis for a better understanding of their properties, functions and their potential for practical applications. In this review, we present some recent advances in the studies of human β-defensins, with an emphasis on possible correlations between their structural and functional properties.

**Keywords.** Human β-defensin, innate and adaptive immunity, antimicrobial and chemotactic activity, β-defensin structure, structure-function relationship.

**Introduction**

Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), a diverse group of small molecules (over 800 examples are recognized to date [1]), are classified into several categories based on their primary structures and topologies [2–6]. In humans, one important category of AMPs are defensins [7]. This category encapsulates the group of β-sheet-rich, cationic and amphipathic peptides, usually consisting of six invariant cysteine residues forming characteristic networks of disulfide bridges that assume a conserved structural fold [8–10]. Defensins were identified in many multicellular organisms, including plants [11, 12], invertebrate [13] and vertebrate animals [14], as well as in insects [15]. Over 40 open reading frames (ORFs) with nucleotide sequences bearing signatures defined for defensins have been identified in the human genome [16]. Protein products were confirmed *in vivo* for only 10 of those ORFs, whereas corresponding messenger RNA (mRNA) was identified for an additional 11 sequences (Table 1). Based primarily on the spacing between the cysteine residues and the topology of the disulfide bridges, human defensins are organized into three classes, α-, β- and θ-defensins [10, 17]. It is necessary to mention the provisional nature of the θ-class (the cyclic defensins). The only primate θ-defensin described so far is one isolated from rhesus mon-

key leucocytes [17]. Although at least six genes coding for θ-defensins have been found in the human genome, premature stop codons in the genes abort translation and subsequent peptide production [17–20].

In this overview, we intend to highlight the most recent results from studies of human β-defensins. Many excellent reviews on human defensins, including β-class, have already been published [5, 14, 21–32], and avoiding some redundancy is impossible. However, the increasing knowledge of the structural properties of human defensins gathered during last several years has not been reviewed proportionally. We attempt to fill this gap by emphasizing recent advancements in the area of structural studies of human β-defensins.

## Classification

The first reported β-defensin, the tracheal antimicrobial peptide (TAP) [33], was a peptide with antimicrobial properties isolated from cow tongue. The assignment of TAP to the defensin family was based on its functional and structural properties, similar to those described earlier for several neutrophil peptides (NPs, referred to as α-defensins) [34]. The spacing between the cysteine residues and the topology of the disulfide bonds in TAP were, however, different compared with α-defensins. Whereas six cysteine residues in α-defensins form the disulfide bonds with the topology Cys¹-Cys⁶, Cys²-Cys⁴ and Cys³-Cys⁵ (or 1–6, 2–4, 3–5), the connectivity found in TAP has the topology 1–5, 2–4, 3–6. Comparison of the primary structures for β-defensins from various sources defines them as peptides consisting, in the mature form, of 36 or more amino acid residues with an identifiable consensus sequence: X₂₋₁₀Cx₅₋₆(G/A)xCX₃₋₄Cx₉₋₁₃CCx₄₋₇CCxₙ, (where x is any amino acid) [35].

## Gene distribution and organization

The first human β-defensin, hBD-1, was identified in 1995 and purified from the plasma of patients with renal disease [36]. Since then, several other human β-defensins have been isolated, or their coding nucleotide sequences have been identified by genome analysis (Table 1, Fig. 1). Human β-defensin 2 (hBD-2) was originally isolated from psoriatic skin lesions [70], whereas hBD-3 was nearly simultaneously purified from psoriatic scales [57, 58] and predicted using bioinformatics [71]. The original reports on hBD-4 through hBD-6 were based solely on genome analyses [59, 60].

Recent, comprehensive searches of the human genome have revealed almost 40 potential coding regions for β-defensins (DEFBs) [16, 68]. Because of the high frequency of gene duplication within β-defensin gene clus-

ters, it is possible that the number of *DEFB* genes is even higher [64]. Some of the *DEFB* coding sequences, however, likely represent pseudogenes, since their mRNA products contain premature stop codons [16].

The first gene cluster, coding for β-defensins *DEFB1*, *DEFB4* and *DEFB103*, is located within chromosomal region 8p21-p23, which also includes all the α-defensin genes [16, 72, 73]. This observation suggested the presence of the common ancestral progenitor defensin gene [16]. Subsequently, three other *DEFB* gene clusters were identified within chromosomes 6p12, 20q11.1 and 20p13. To date, the expression of many of these β-defensins was confirmed by either reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or mRNA hybridization at the transcriptional level (Table 1).

The pattern of human β-defensin genes shows a common organization. The genomic structure consists of two exons and one intron. The only exception is the gene *DEFB105*, which contains three exons and two introns. In all but the *DEFB1* gene, the first exon encodes the signal peptide and the second carries information about the sequence of mature peptide preceded by a short anionic pro-peptide [14, 57, 73, 74]. In the *DEFB1* gene, the first exon encodes the signal peptide and pro-peptide segment [73]. Post-translational modifications include the proteolytic cleavage of the signal sequence and, subsequently, of the N-terminal pro-piece [75, 76]. A mature peptide is often additionally truncated at the N-terminus, yielding multiple forms released into designated compartments [36, 47, 51, 77]. *In vivo*, processed according to an as yet unknown mechanism, β-pro-defensins are secreted into the immediate surroundings of epithelial cells.

A growing family of proteins with a strong homology to β-defensins, called epididymis-specific secretory proteins (EP2/HE2/SPAG11), comprises the androgen-dependent molecules that are specifically expressed in the epithelium of the male reproductive tract [78–81]. The human gene encoding EP2 is located within the same section of chromosome 8 as several of the β-defensin genes [60, 71]. Through splice variation, several transcripts of the EP2 gene (EP2A-EP2I) are generated in various regions of the human and chimpanzee epididymis [82–84]. Three of these variants, EP2C/D/E, share the cysteine motifs with β-defensins [82, 83]. The members of the EP2 family also share antibacterial properties with β-defensins [85, 86].

**Sites of expression and gene regulation**

To date, only the first four human β-defensins have been characterized in some detail (Table 1). HBD-1 is primarily expressed in the epithelial lining of the urinary and respiratory tracts [43, 47, 87]. The constitutive expression of hBD-1 is observed in various tissues [48, 49, 88] and may be modulated by inflammation [89–93]. Furthermore, expression of hBD-1 can be induced and upregulated by lipopolysaccharides (LPSs), heat-inactivated *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* and interferon gamma (IFN-γ) [89, 91–94].

The most prevalent expression of hBD-2 is observed in skin and the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts; however, substantial amounts of this defensin are present throughout the entire epithelia [51, 95]. HBD-3, in addition to the epithelia, was also detected at lower levels in different nonepithelial cells in the heart, liver, fetal thymus and placenta [40, 57, 96]. Isolation of hBD-4 from the natural source has not yet been described [7]. Whereas analyses of the natural distribution of hBD-4 are based on detection of appropriate mRNA (Table 1), a partial characterization of this defensin relies on synthetic/recombinant preparations [59]. HBD-4 is primarily expressed in the testis and epididymis [59]. Although the inducible expression of hBD-4 was detected in primary keratinocytes [61], so far there is no confirmation of its presence in human skin.

Due to a very low basal expression of hBD-2 through hBD-4 in epithelial cells, the expression-regulation of these defensins is somewhat different compared with hBD-1. Up-regulation of their expression can be induced in response to bacterial infection or proinflammatory stimuli [48, 58, 59, 70]. At the transcriptional level, induction of hBD-2 and hBD-3 synthesis was observed in gastric and respiratory epithelium, peripheral blood, dendritic cells and keratinocytes [5, 84, 94, 95, 97–99]. Stimulators of hBD-2 expression include interleukin-1α (IL-α), IL-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), IFN-γ, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), isoleucine, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D₃, LPSs and some Gram-negative bacteria [7, 89, 94, 96–98, 100–103]. Similar to hBD-2, expression of hBD-3 is induced in keratinocytes and the respiratory epithelium by TNF-α, IL-1β, IFN-γ, various bacteria and yeast [57, 58, 71]. In contrast to hBD-2, upregulation of hBD-3 expression in keratinocytes was observed in the presence of transforming growth factor alpha (TGF-α) and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) [99]. The identified factors upregulating hBD4 expression are similar, as in the case of hBD-2 and hBD-3 [61, 99].

Variable expression and induction patterns of β-defensins suggest involvement of multiple signaling pathways in the regulation of these processes [91, 98, 104, 105]. In various tissues, induction of hBD-2 expression by cytokines and bacterial components is mediated through transcriptional nuclear factor κB (NF-κB)—sometimes assisted by activated protein 1, by mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP-kinase) and by protein kinase C (PKC) [56, 98, 106–111]. A potential role of the JAK2 (Janus kinase)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling pathway was suggested in hBD-1 and hBD-3 expression [61, 91]. Also, a contribution of protease-ac-

tivated receptors to hBD-2 upregulation in epithelia was recently described [112]. Induction of antimicrobial peptide proceeds through activation of a distinct group of toll-like receptors (TLRs), which recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns [104, 113, 114]. Through subsequent activation of NF-κB and/or MAP-kinase signaling pathways, TLRs modulate the expression of numerous genes [104, 113, 114]. The participation of specific toll-like receptors (i.e. TLR2, 4, 6, 9) in the induction of hBD-2 expression, following different bacterial stimuli, was observed in different cells and tissues [113–122]. In all cases, the NF-κB and AP1 sites were also found to be necessary for induction of hBD-2 expression. Together, the reported results demonstrate the complexity of mechanisms underlying upregulation of β-defensins and open a possibility for roles of other molecular partners or signaling pathways in the inducible production of hBDs.

The mechanisms regulating the expression of human β-defensins other than hBD-1 through -4 are currently very poorly understood. The expression of hBD-8 and hBD-14, induced by IL-1β or the Candida species, appears to be regulated similarly to hBD-4, involving the NF-κB, MAP-kinase or JAK-STAT signal transduction pathways [63]. The identification of multiple NF-κB-binding sites within the hBD-6 gene points in a similar direction [60]. Understanding the details of the expression patterns, inducing factors and signaling pathways for recently identified β-defensins requires further investigation. An example here could be β-defensins encoded on chromosome 20, misleadingly originally called ‘epididymis-specific’ [16, 60, 65, 68]. Recent studies show that, in addition to epididymis and testis, these proteins are also secreted in the pancreas, skeletal muscle and kidney (DEFB118, DEFB125–127) [64, 68]. However, the biological functions of these peptides are unknown, a particularly interesting fact since there is no evidence for their expression

in airways or skin, i.e. the common expression sites for β-defensins that are primarily involved in innate immunity [68].

## Diversity of biological activities

In addition to the well-recognized antimicrobial properties of β-defensins, recent reports picture these proteins as potent immunomodulators, indicating their important role in regulating both innate and adaptive immunities [5, 14, 21, 22, 30, 31, 35, 123–130].

### Antimicrobial activity

Each of the β-defensins characterized to date has the capacity to kill or inhibit *in vitro* a wide variety of bacteria and fungi, particularly at low concentrations of salt and plasma proteins (Table 2) [10, 14, 31, 36, 125, 131, 132]. The spectrum of this antibacterial activity varies for each of the four proteins. hBD-1 and hBD-2 have been shown to be particularly effective against Gram-negative bacteria and some fungi but relatively less potent against Gram-positive bacteria [51, 70, 87, 133]. hBD-3 is a powerful antimicrobial agent with a broad range of activity toward yeast, Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, including the vancomycin-resistant *Enterococcus faecium* [57, 58].

Studies of the effectiveness of hBD-2 and hBD-3 against oral pathogens showed that both defensins are more potent against aerobic bacteria (100% effective) than anaerobic bacteria (21.4% and 50% effective for hBD-2 and hBD-3, respectively) [134]. Both defensins also demonstrate strain-specific activity against *Candida* species [90]. A synergistic antibacterial effect against *Staphylococcus aureus* was described for hBD1–3, LL-37 and lysozyme [135].

Several studies also described potent antibacterial activity of synthetic hBD-4, including such pathogens as *Burkholderia cepacia*, bacteria resistant to other antibacterial agents and antibiotics [26, 59]. A number of reports showed that the microbicidal activity of β-defensins (with the exception of hBD-3) was strongly inhibited by sodium chloride at physiological concentrations or by various divalent cations [57–59, 87, 95, 136]. These observations suggest the significance of electrostatic interactions for β-defensin activity and seem to restrict sites of such activity to low-salt compartments (i.e., the surface of epithelium or skin) [57–59, 87, 95]. More recent evidence shows, however, that the salt sensitivity of β-defensins in vivo may be lower than believed originally [137]. Such salt tolerance as well as structure dependence was observed for a few recently identified β-defensins [64, 67, 133]. Whereas hBD-3-like antibacterial activity was demonstrated for hBD-28, similarly sized hBD-27 was completely inactive against the bacteria tested at concentrations up to 300 μg/ml [133]. High and dose-dependent anti-*Escherichia coli* activity was described for synthetic peptides corresponding to the protein products of *DEFB106* and *DEFB118* [64, 66].

### Anti-HIV effect

Several recent reports demonstrated that β-defensins may contribute to controlling the human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 (HIV-1) replication in vivo [138–140]. Quiñones-Mateu and coworkers [139] demonstrated the HIV-1-induced expression of hBD-2 and hBD-3 in human oral epithelial cells, and dose-dependent inhibition of HIV-1 replication in vitro by recombinant hBD-2 and hBD-3. A similar inhibitory effect was observed during R5 and X4 HIV infection of PMBC by chemically synthesized β-defensins [138]. Whereas the former report indicated that hBD-2 and hBD-3 downregulate the HIV-1 coreceptor CXCR4 in PBMC and T lymphocytes, suggesting inhibition of the X4 virus by β-defensins at the viral entry step [139], authors of the latter did not observe receptor down-regulation by hBD-2, and suggested instead that a post-entry, intracellular signaling event is responsible for the inhibition of HIV-1 replication [138]. The idea of intracellular signaling involvement is reminiscent of studies on inhibition of HIV replication by related human neutrophil α-defensins [141, 142]. Despite the differences in the interpretation of inhibition at the cellular level, β-defensins can directly inactivate HIV-1 virions [138, 139]. This activity appears to be a common property of defensins from different families [140]. One study reports the inhibitory effect of the influenza virus fusion into host cells by retrocyclin 2 (θ-defensin RC2), hBD-3 and mannan-binding lectin (MBL) [143]. Authors proposed that inhibition of viral entry by these natural host defense molecules arises due to cross-linking and/or immobilizing of cell-surface glycoproteins. Another report demonstrated the association of a single-nucleotide polymorphism (44C/G) in the *DEFB1* (hBD-1) gene with HIV-1 infection in Italian children [144]. It has been also shown that hBD-1 expression is significantly reduced in alveolar macrophages of HIV-infected patients [145]. Upcoming studies should provide more details on the molecular basis of HIV-1 inhibition by β-defensins.

#### Chemotactic effects and in vivo immunoenhancing activity

In 1999, Yang and coworkers observed the recruitment of human immature dendritic cells (DCs) and memory peripheral blood memory T cells by a concentration gradient of hBD-1 and hBD-2 [35]. The chemotactic activity of hBD2–4 was later described for other blood cells [57, 59, 146, 147]. In another report authors described the hDB-2-dependent activation of mast cells [148]. The chemotactic and immunoenhancing activities of β-defensins are not suppressed by the physiological concentration of salts and serum proteins [35]. The recruitment of immature DCs and memory T cells by hBD-2 and hBD-3 is mediated through the G-protein-coupled receptor (GiPCR) CCR6 [35, 147, 149–151]. The competition between hBD-2 and MIP-3α (the chemokine ligand of CCR6) for CCR6 also was recently confirmed for stimulated keratinocytes [152]. Combined, these results not only confirm common signaling pathways in β-defensins and MIP-3α regulation, but also suggest an important and complementary role of β-defensins in innate and adaptive immunity. In addition to CCR6-mediated chemotaxis by hBD1-3, gradient-dependent recruitment of CCR6-deficient monocytes and macrophages observed for hBD-3 and hBD-4 suggests utilization of an additional GiPCR receptor(s) [130].

The ability of β-defensins to chemoattract and/or activate a wide variety of blood cells suggests that β-defensins play roles in both the innate and antigen-specific immunity of the host. Furthermore, the chemotactic activity of β-defensins towards immature DCs also facilitates antigen uptake, processing and presentation, leading to induction of antigen-specific immune responses [123, 153]. The concept of β-defensins contributing to innate and adaptive immunity through the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, as previously shown for α-defensins [154, 155], was also recently described [156, 157]. The authors demonstrated an individual and synergistic induction of IL-18 as well as other pro-inflammatory cytokines (i.e., IL-20 and IL-8) by hBD-1 through hBD-4, and of the cathelicidin LL-37 in cultured human keratinocytes. IL-18, IL-20 and IL-8 are believed to be involved in the pathogenesis of psoriasis.
Additional activities of $\beta$-defensins

Several recent reports also indicate additional physiological functions of $\beta$-defensins [156, 158–161]. Significant upregulation of hBD-1 and hBD-3 observed during the maturation of keratinocytes suggests a possible role of these peptides in cell differentiation processes [158, 159].

Another group of studies focused on identification of correlations between the changes in $\beta$-defensin expression patterns and the types and/or stages of tumor development [156, 159, 161, 162]. Whereas it was shown that differential gene expression profiles of hBD-1 can be useful for distinguishing the subtypes of both renal cell carcinoma and prostate cancer [156, 161], no similar correlation was observed for hBD-2 in the case of gastric tumors [162].

Observation of hBD-3 expression in osteoarthritic (OA) joints in the absence of bacterial challenge prompted suggestion of the role of this peptide in the tissue remodeling processes taking place in OA cartilages [156, 160]. High expression levels in the male reproductive tract observed for EP2 isoforms and a number of recently discovered $\beta$-defensins (Table 1) indicate that these proteins may play roles in the range of protective, adhesive, and regulatory functions, confined to this compartment [60, 68, 80, 124, 163]. However, despite encouraging preliminary results obtained during studies of $\beta$-defensins 126, 118, and 119–123, it is still unclear why such a wide range of $\beta$-defensins is present in the male reproductive tract [65, 66, 69, 163]. Whereas antimicrobial activities of these defensins have been demonstrated *in vitro*, the nature of their primary activity *in vivo* is still not fully understood.

Structures of human $\beta$-defensins

Primary structures

The $\beta$-arrangement of disulfide bonds connecting the conserved six cysteines has been confirmed experimentally only for hBD-1, hBD-2 and hBD-3 [36, 51, 58]. With the exception of hBD-5 and hBD-12, the first conserved cysteine residue is situated near the amino termini of the peptides (Fig. 1). The Cys¹-Cys⁴ bridge introduces the macrocyclic covalent chain within the core of peptides [28].

Aside from the six cysteine residues, only a few other residues are conserved to most $\beta$-defensins. Using the hBD-1 numbering, these residues are Gly10, a cationic residue at position 13; Glu21; and hydrophobic residues 24 and 36. The four most-studied hBDs (hBD-1 through hBD-4) have a high content of cationic residues (Lys, Arg), clustered primarily near the carboxyl termini of the peptides (Fig. 1). Aggregation of these positive charges is important for antimicrobial activity [1, 5, 14, 22, 24, 26, 28, 164].

Several $\beta$-defensins encoded on chromosomes 6 and 20 are characterized by an unusually long C-terminal tail (Fig. 1). This extension, rich in anionic residues, has no evident sequence similarity to other $\beta$-defensins [67, 68]. Similar motifs are also found in the $\beta$-defensin-like family of HE2 peptides [65, 82, 85]. It was suggested that these long C-termini contribute to the decreased salt sensitivity of the antibacterial activity, as observed for $\beta$-defensin 118 [67]. The functional significance of this hypothesis remains to be analyzed.

Tertiary structures

To date, the structures of only three human $\beta$-defensins (1 through 3) have been determined [165–169]. Appropriate coordinates are deposited in the Protein Data Bank (www.rcsb.org) with the entry codes 1IJV, 1E4S and 1IJU [166, 169] for hBD1; 1FD3, 1FD4, 1E4Q, and 1FQQ [165, 167, 169] for hDB2; and 1KJ6 and 1KJ5 [168] for hBD-3. Despite limited amino acid sequence conservation among the structurally characterized hBDs [168], their tertiary structures are remarkably similar (Fig. 2).

In all structures, the core of the molecule has a common ('defensin-like') topological fold (Structural Classification of Proteins) [174, 175]. The prototype for this fold is the structure of human $\alpha$-defensin-3 (PDB code 1DFN) [176]. The core of the defensin molecule consists of three $\beta$-strands arranged in an antiparallel sheet, which is constrained by three intramolecular disulfide bridges. In $\beta$-defensins (but not in the $\alpha$-class), the $\beta$-sheet is flanked by an $\alpha$-helical segment of a variable length, formed by the N-terminal fragment of the molecule [165, 166, 168]. The orientation of the $\alpha$-helix in relation to the $\beta$-sheet is stabilized by the disulfide bridge (Cys¹-Cys⁵). Because of the specific arrangement and linkage of the six conserved cysteine residues in $\beta$-defensins, it was recently suggested that the $\beta$-defensin fold should be recognized as a distinct topological family of proteins, which would also include some toxins [177–179]. Such a proposal may be somewhat premature, since the previous studies of the hBD-3 isoforms provided evidence contradictory to those observations [180].

A few additional notes may support the role of the $\beta$-sheet as central to the defensin's structure and, presumably, its function. Part of the second $\beta$-strand in all defensins (including the $\alpha$-class [181, 182]), consisting of the conserved motif Gly-X-Cys, forms a $\beta$-bulge [166, 182]. The primarily role of $\beta$-bulges is to accentuate a twist of the $\beta$-sheets, and their presence is suggested as necessary for the correct folding and formation of the native structure by mammalian defensins [181]. Recently, it was shown that residues forming $\beta$-sheets are less susceptible to either negative or positive selection during the evolution of mammalian $\beta$-defensin genes [62].

The size of the N-terminal $\alpha$-helix, present in hBD-1 through hBD-3 (also found in murine defensins mBD-7 and mBD-8 [169] and in penguin protein (Sphe-2) [183], but not in bovine $\beta$-defensin-12 (bBD-12) [184]) is not correlated with the number of amino acids preceding the first cysteine residue (the N-terminus of hBD-3 appears unstructured [168]). The small size and variable length of this helical fragment have prompted suggestions that some hBDs may lack it completely [177]. The specific conformation of the N-termini in $\beta$-defensins may be important for the biological properties of these proteins. The primary structures of this region were suggested as contributing to observed differences in the antimicrobial specificity of $\beta$-defensins [167].

Despite only moderate sequence conservation, the C-terminal sections in most $\beta$-defensins are rich in basic and hydrophobic amino acids (Fig. 1). Consequently, variably shaped molecular surfaces of the C-termini of hBD-1 through hBD-3 have amphiphilic properties, with clearly identifiable, asymmetrically distributed, positively charged motifs (Fig. 2).

### Quaternary structures

Human $\beta$-defensins display the potential to form various oligomeric structures [165–169], which may play a significant role or influence the biological activities and functions of these proteins [24, 164]. The nature of oligomerization observed in $\beta$-defensins appears to be protein-

Figure 3. Models of interactions between defensins and bacterial membranes. (a) The ‘pore-formation’ model originally derived from structural studies of hNP-3 [176]. (b) The less structurally restricted ‘carpet’ model, exemplified here by results of crystallographic studies of hBD-2 [165]. The dimeric structures of both defensins, seen in their crystals and shown schematically in the smaller, black panels, are accompanied by models of larger aggregates, theoretically derived ‘pores’ of hNP-3 and crystallographically determined octamers of hBD-2 (larger black panels). The dimerization mode of hNP-3, a prerequisite for the assembly of the modeled pore, is inaccessible for hBD-2.

specific. The first report of β-defensin oligomerization followed the crystallographic studies of hBD-2 [165]. Results obtained for two different crystal forms describe the octameric assemblies contributed by four noncovalent dimers of hBD-2, stabilized by interactions between the first β-strands of both monomers. The dimers are topologically distinct from those described earlier for the α-defensins [176]. The N-terminal α-helix plays an important role in the stabilization of the hBD-2 octamers [165]. Oligomerization of hBD-2 was not confirmed in subsequent studies in solution by either nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometry, light scattering or size exclusion chromatography [167, 169]. Because the aggregation of β-defensins occurs only at elevated protein concentrations (>3 mM) and, possibly, in the sterically constraining environment of a bacterial membrane, the results obtained during the crystallographic studies may be the most adequate of all approaches reported [169]. The flat disk shape of hBD-2 octamers and the charge surface distribution suggest the possible mode of interaction with the surfaces of microbial membranes (Fig. 3). Only weakly associated dimers (stabilized primarily through the salt bridges) were found in the crystals of hBD-1 [166]. Taking into account the significant reciprocal dependence of the antimicrobial activity of hBD-1 on salt concentration [87, 131], the latter observation may bear functional relevance. A systematic study of hBD-3 showed that this highly cationic molecule creates symmetric dimers that are stabilized by two salt bridges between Glu-28 and Lys-32, and by one hydrogen bond [168]. Subsequent mutational studies confirmed a significant role of Glu-28 in stabilizing the oligomeric structure of hBD-3 [185]. The capacity to create stable dimers in solution, at low concentrations, has been suggested as a possible reason for the high and salt-independent antibacterial activity of hBD-3 [24, 58, 185].

Non-defensin molecules with the defensin-like fold

The broad distribution of peptides that share the defensin-like fold provided cause to identify the structural similarities among these peptides, and possibly to reconstruct the evolutionary tree connecting them to their common ancestor(s) [186]. A possible evolutionary relation is strongly supported by current structural information [177, 186, 187]. The defensin-like fold has been observed for various toxins, including snake toxins [183, 187], sea anemone toxins [188, 189] and platypus venom toxins (defensin-like peptides, DLP1 and DLP-2) [178, 190, 191]. Curiously, platypus DLPs have neither antimicrobial nor mytotoxic properties, and their roles as the components of the venom are unknown [178]. Although there are no reports on reptile defensins, database searches showed a high degree of similarity between both the signal sequences and mature peptides of human β-defensins and avian β-defensins [183, 186] (e.g. gallinacins [187, 192], gallopavins [187, 193]

Human β-defensins

Structure-function relationship

Antimicrobial activity

The mechanism
An increasing number of studies focus on a better understanding the mechanism governing the microbicidal activities of β-defensins [24, 25, 164, 185, 195, 196]. These studies indicate that β-defensin molecules bind to the negatively charged cytoplasmic membranes and disrupt their integrity, leading to a leakage of intracellular components and inhibition of the DNA, RNA and protein synthesis [3, 6, 22, 23, 26, 125, 132]. Accordingly, the antimicrobial activity and specificity of β-defensins are primarily determined by their physicochemical properties, such as amphiphilic character and a precise balance of positive net charge and hydrophobicity. Additional roles are assigned to the structural properties of β-defensins [14, 24, 185, 195, 196]; oligomerization [25, 165, 168, 197]; and proteolytic stability [7, 198]. Whereas all β-defensins share a very similar structural core, it has been postulated that their microbe specificity results from variable arrangements of nonconserved residues [62, 164]. A broad spectrum of diverse distributions of surface-displayed functions observed for β-defensins is, in turn, a consequence of a pressure posed by constantly evolving bacteria [24, 25].

The central role of interactions between the negatively charged membrane components and β-defensins for the bactericidal properties is supported by the results of experiments with artificial membranes [58, 67, 136, 199, 200], as well as with modified bacterial membranes [29, 201, 202]. The importance of electric forces in defensin action on bacterial membranes was confirmed experimentally for several α-defensins [203–206]. Whereas a partial correlation between the net charge of whole bacteria and the killing potential of β-defensins was demonstrated for some cariogenic and periodontal bacteria, it was limited only to a narrow range of bacterial strains [207]. These results suggest a rather complex mechanism of antibacterial activity of β-defensins, possibly different from the mechanism responsible for the antibacterial activities of other AMPs.

The molecular details of the interactions between β-defensins and membranes are, as yet, not clear. According to one model, β-defensins might form channel-like pores spanning across the membranes [27, 199, 200, 208–213]. Following the initial electrostatic interactions of defensin molecules with anionic phospholipid head groups of the membrane, the peptides are fused into the membrane’s interior. The driving force behind the fusion would be the interaction between hydrophobic components of the membrane lipid core and defensin molecules (Fig. 3). In the second model, the carpet-line layer of β-defensin molecules, formed on the surface of the microbial

membrane, neutralizes negatively charged lipid moieties and the transmembrane electric potential [208, 214–216]. In this model, β-defensins act like classic detergents, binding at high concentrations to the phospholipid head groups on the bacterial surface. Support for the ‘pore-formation’ model is provided by the amphiphilic character of the β-defensin molecules and, to some extent, by their ability to oligomerize [217]. The weakness of this model stems from the requirement of specific oligomerization needed for channel formation, i.e. a property that as yet has not been directly observed for any defensin. In contrast, neither specific oligomerization nor extensive hydrophobicity of the surface is required, according to the ‘carpet model’ [23]. Whereas hydrophobic regions of the molecular surface of β-defensin molecules play a role in stabilizing their oligomeric structures, a demonstration of charge-dependent activity of these peptides is in agreement with the ‘carpet’ model [180].

Most likely, however, neither of these two ‘pure’ models correctly describes the mechanism of microbial killing, and multiple flavors of the overall scheme may be behind the interactions of different β-defensins and various microbes. Further elucidation of mechanistic details probably will require studies of the interactions between β-defensins and membrane components other than positively charged lipids (i.e. carbohydrates), as well as studies of possible specific interactions with molecular targets, specific to individual microorganisms [3, 14, 24, 132, 164, 180, 217].

### Role of oligomerization vs. positive charge

A role of the quaternary structure on the biological activity of β-defensins has been explored by Campopiano and coworkers [218]. They described a positive effect of covalently cross-linked dimerization of Defr1 (a β-defensin-like peptide from mouse heart) on the ability to disrupt bacterial membranes. Broad and salt-independent antimicrobial activity of hBD-3 has been thought to be a result of a high positive charge (+11) and the ability to dimerize [58, 168]. Subsequent studies of the structure-activity relationship of hBD-3, however, have not confirmed a clear role of oligomerization in the antibacterial activity of this peptide [185, 196]. In turn, a high overall hydrophobicity and positive net charge of the hBD-3 molecule was suggested as more important than its ability to oligomerize. In line with these conclusions, introduction of additional tryptophan and tyrosine residues have been shown to enhance activity [196]. Further evidence comes from the observation that the positive selection of the *DEFB103* gene in human and primate species has favored alteration of the positive charge rather than other factors that could affect the antimicrobial properties of hBD-3 [24].

### Role of the disulfide array

Several reports indicated that the three disulfide bridges are not required for antimicrobial activity of β-defensins [180, 218–221]. Analyses of the structure-activity relationship also showed that full-length hBD-3 displays very little change in anti-*E. coli* activity, irrespective of the presence or connectivity of disulfides [180, 221]. Similar results have been obtained for the synthetic C-terminal fragments of bovine β-defensin-12, for which the antibacterial activity also did not seem to be related to the number and location of disulfide bonds [219, 220]. Defr1, consisting of only five cysteine residues, has high antimicrobial activity against *P. aeruginosa*, whereas activity of its mutated form, stabilized by a network of disulfide bonds, similar to that of other β-defensins, is significantly impaired [218]. A recent report indicates that the main function of disulfide linkages in defensins is protection from proteolysis due to stabilization of the compact and rigid fold [7]. Although the presence of disulfide bonds may not be required for the antimicrobial properties of β-defensins, a requirement of restrained structures with precisely defined Cys-Cys linkages for other biological properties of these peptides (such as chemotaxis) should be studied further [180].

### The role of other structural motifs

Observation that the stability of the secondary structure of hBD-3 may be independent of the disulfide network opens the possibility that the antibacterial activities of β-defensins may be related to some local topological features of these peptides [196]. Identification of such structural motifs in β-defensins appears, however, quite difficult [164]. Previous studies of bBD-12 showed some correlation between the basic charge of the C-terminal tail and high *in vitro* antimicrobial activity of this peptide [219, 220]. Similar observations were also reported for hBD-3 [221]. The latter report also suggested, however, other structural features as possibly important for interactions with the microbial membranes [221]. Data indicate a possible role of the N-terminal α-helix in the antimicrobial properties of hBD-2. The relative orientation of this α-helix in hBD-2 is stabilized by Asp4, the residue earlier demonstrated as a significant factor for this peptide’s ability to permeabilize the *E. coli* cytoplasmic membrane [24, 195]. Subsequent work on derivatives of hBD-3 [221] partially confirmed these observations, reporting the peptide corresponding to the N-terminal α-helical fragment as a potent agent against *S. aureus* and *Candida albicans*. Evolutionary analyses of the BD-1 through BD-4 genes in primates indicate several sites, located within the N-terminal helix, as being subject to positive selection, suggesting a possible involvement of this fragment in anchoring the β-defensin molecules to the bacterial membrane [62].

Monomers of both proteins are shown in the form of the backbone tubes sketched together with the molecular surfaces (figures have been created based on [224, 225]). The aspartate residues, hydrophobic residues (Leu, Tyr or Val) and positively charged residues are shown in red, gray and blue, respectively. The cysteine residues within the DPVTCL and DCCL motifs of hBD-2 and MIP-3α, respectively, are shown in yellow.

### Hemolytic properties
The interaction of defensins with membranes is relatively selective [222]. The phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylethanolamine-rich and less-charged cytoplasmic membranes of eukaryotic host cells are degraded by defensins, as demonstrated in the hemolysis and cytotoxicity tests of hBD-3 on various human cells, including erythrocytes [22, 58, 139]. The structural basis of the interactions between β-defensins with eukaryotic membranes is very poorly understood. Limited data suggest the importance of hydrophobic interactions for hemolytic and cytotoxic activities of β-defensins [197]. Kluver and coworkers [196] demonstrated that the activity of hBD-3 on eukaryotic cells is dependent on overall hydrophobicity and is not related to the distribution of secondary structure elements.

### Chemotactic activity
The molecular details behind the receptor-mediated chemotactic activity of β-defensins are unknown. Studies of the hBD-3 isoforms with alternate disulfide linkages showed alteration of chemotactic activities against monocytes and CCR6(+)HEK293 cells, depending on the disulfide topology [180]. Importantly, the disulfide-deficient variant of hBD-3 was completely inactive in these assays. Enhanced activity of some of the isoforms, as compared with the chemokine ligand of CCR6, MIP-3α, suggests a direct involvement of topological motifs encapsulating the disulfide sites in receptor binding and activation by hBD-3 [180].

Competition between β-defensins and MIP-3α for CCR6 binding has led to suggestions of similarly structured motifs, present in both ligands [35, 223]. While a comparison of the primary structures of hBDs (1 and 2) and MIP-3α revealed only very weak homology, subtle similarities were identified at the level of the three-dimensional structure [224, 225]. These similarities include small topological motifs that could mediate receptor recognition, activation and signal dispatching; shallow grooves on one face of the molecules that potentially create the region of CCR6 binding; and similar distributions of charge residues on the molecular surface areas, which are believed important for receptor binding specificity [224, 225] (see also Fig. 5).

The motif consisting of two N-terminal cysteines and the flanking residues (the DCCL motif in MIP-3α) is believed to be important for the chemotactic activity of many CC chemokines [226–230]. A major role in receptor-ligand recognition, high-affinity binding, activation and signal dispatching was attributed to these N-terminal residues [228, 231, 232]. It has been postulated that molecules of hBD-1 and hBD-2 carry topologically similar motifs, with a single asparate followed by the hydrophobic residue (DHY motif in hBD-1 and DPV or DPVTCL motif in hBD-2 [224, 225]). These residues, being positioned within the well-structured α-helix near a disulfide bond, are also sterically restrained.

Another feature in hBD-2, resembling the groove in the molecule of MIP-3α created by the N-loop and the β2-β3 hairpin, is formed by the N-terminal helix, the loop between first two β-strands and the residues at the C-terminus [68, 224, 228]. Mutagenesis and receptor binding studies have indicated the importance of this groove for recognition and high-affinity ligand binding in chemokines [231, 233].

Beyond the strictly structural similarities between β-defensins and MIP-3α, both types of molecules share some similarity in the distribution of positively charged residues on the molecular surface (Fig. 5) [224, 225].

Interestingly, antimicrobial activity was also reported for MIP-3α [234].

# Closing remarks

Current evidence shows multiple and complementary roles of β-defensins. In addition to the hallmark, antimicrobial properties of these proteins, recent studies provide numerous examples of other activities, although their relevance *in vivo* is not yet completely established. The large number of these structurally and functionally similar molecules encoded by a single genome suggests redundancies and complementarities of their biological roles. Whereas mice deficient in a single β-defensin are more susceptible to infections by specific pathogens, their antimicrobial resistance is not grossly compromised [235, 236]. However, despite accelerated efforts in research on defensins, numerous questions still remain unanswered. What is the molecular mechanism of their antibacterial and antiviral activity? Are their chemotactic properties physiologically relevant? How, if at all, are the structural features of these peptides related to their biological properties and specificities? These are just a few, yet very important, questions that certainly need to be addressed. Current interest in human defensins promises that in the near future, more than just a handful of the proteins will be fully characterized, leading to a better understanding of their multifaceted roles in human physiology and pathophysiology. It is already apparent that the properties of defensins warrant an exploration of their potential in therapeutic and preventive (i.e., topical antimicrobial) applications. Their diversity of biological functions makes β-defensins attractive candidates for the development of novel therapeutic strategies [237, 238]. Different mechanisms of action, as compared with those of traditional antibacterial and antiviral drugs, has already led to the consideration of β-defensins as substitutes in the treatment of various microbial infections [140, 143, 239], thermal injury [21] and Crohn’s disease [30]. The anticancer activity of these proteins indicates a possibility for their use in cancer treatment [222], while their role as modulators and/or enhancers of immune responses hints at the development of novel vaccines [240].
