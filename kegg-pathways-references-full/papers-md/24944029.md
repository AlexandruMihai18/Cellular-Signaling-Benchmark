## ABSTRACT

Aldosterone is a steroid hormone synthesized in and secreted from the outer layer of the adrenal cortex, the zona glomerulosa. Aldosterone is responsible for regulating sodium homeostasis, thereby helping to control blood volume and blood pressure. Insufficient aldosterone secretion can lead to hypotension and circulatory shock, particularly in infancy. On the other hand, excessive aldosterone levels, or those too high for sodium status, can cause hypertension and exacerbate the effects of high blood pressure on multiple organs, contributing to renal disease, stroke, visual loss, and congestive heart failure. Aldosterone is also thought to directly induce end-organ damage, including in the kidneys and heart. Because of the significance of aldosterone to the physiology and pathophysiology of the cardiovascular system, it is important to understand the regulation of its biosynthesis and secretion from the adrenal cortex. Herein, the mechanisms regulating aldosterone production in zona glomerulosa cells are discussed, with a particular emphasis on signaling pathways involved in the secretory response to the main controllers of aldosterone production, the renin-angiotensin II system, serum potassium levels and adrenocorticotropic hormone. The signaling pathways involved include phospholipase C-mediated phosphoinositide hydrolysis, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, cytosolic calcium levels, calcium influx pathways, calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases, diacylglycerol, protein kinases C and D, 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, phospholipase D, mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways, tyrosine kinases, adenylate cyclase, and cAMP-dependent protein kinase. A complete understanding of the signaling events regulating aldosterone biosynthesis may allow the identification of novel targets for therapeutic interventions in hypertension, primary aldosteronism, congestive heart failure, renal disease, and other cardiovascular disorders. © 2014 American Physiological Society.

## Introduction

The steroid hormone aldosterone is an important contributor to salt and water homeostasis under physiological conditions, and abnormalities in its production can trigger aberrant blood pressure regulation, by promoting sodium retention (at the expense of potassium ion conservation). Thus, excessive aldosterone levels can result in hypertension, which is a disease that is prevalent in the United States, with over 76 million diagnosed (statistics from the American Heart Association at http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/). Importantly, a significant proportion of essential hypertensives without frank hypokalemia have recently been found to exhibit hyperaldosteronism [reviewed in (51, 286)]. In fact, the prevalence of primary aldosteronism has been estimated at approximately 10% of all hypertensives and is more common in individuals with resistant hypertension (those on three or more medications to control blood pressure) [reviewed in (52)]. Hypertension has been linked to cognitive impairment [(159) and reviewed in (162)] and is known to be a contributor to renal disease, stroke and visual loss, as well as congestive heart failure. Direct effects of aldosterone in the kidney, separate from its effects on blood pressure, have also been postulated (140). In addition to aldosterone’s role in hypertension, this hormone also exerts direct actions in cardiomyocytes, where it contributes to cardiac fibrosis and congestive heart failure

[reviewed in (52)]. The Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study (RALES) and the Eplerenone Post-Acute Myocardial Infarction Heart Failure Efficacy and Survival Study (EPHESUS) indicate that antagonists of the receptor for aldosterone, the mineralocorticoid receptor, added on top of standard treatments, are able to reduce morbidity and mortality in congestive heart failure patients [(232, 252) and reviewed in (182, 251)]. In addition, accumulating evidence points to a role for aldosterone in the insulin resistance and hypertension observed in the metabolic syndrome [reviewed in (335)]. The likely significance of aldosterone in cardiovascular pathologies makes an understanding of the mechanisms regulating its synthesis and secretion critically important.

Figure 1 Schematic of the adrenal gland. The adrenal gland is composed of the outer adrenal cortex and the inner adrenal medulla. The adrenal cortex is, in turn, composed of three layers: the innermost layer, the zona reticularis synthesizes and secretes adrenal androgens, such as dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and DHEA-sulfate. The middle layer of the adrenal cortex, the zona fasciculata, synthesizes, and secretes the glucocorticoid cortisol. (In rodents the glucocorticoid produced by the zona fasciculata is corticosterone.) The outer layer adjacent to the fibrous capsule delimiting the adrenal gland is the zona glomerulosa, which secretes the mineralocorticoid aldosterone. The adrenal medulla secretes the catecholamines epinephrine and norepinephrine.

gland, the adrenal cortex (Fig. 1). As a steroid hormone, aldosterone is not stored in the glomerulosa cells and is secreted upon its synthesis under the control of multiple regulators. There are two major controllers of aldosterone biosynthesis: angiotensin II (AngII) and serum potassium levels and a secondary regulator, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). AngII is part of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), and its production is initiated and controlled by the protease renin. Thus, decreased renal perfusion pressure, among other regulatory factors [reviewed in (63)], causes the juxtaglomerular cells of the kidney to release renin, which in turn, cleaves serum angiotensinogen secreted by the liver to angiotensin I. Angiotensin I is further proteolyzed by angiotensin-converting enzymes in the vasculature to generate the octapeptide AngII. AngII then raises blood pressure through multiple actions, including an acute ability to induce vasoconstriction and a sustained ability to increase salt and fluid retention through its actions to increase thirst and aldosterone secretion from the adrenal cortex. As angiotensinogen circulates in ample quantities, and widely distributed angiotensin-converting enzymes are able to rapidly cleave angiotensin I to AngII, renin activity represents the key determinant of AngII formation (229). It should be noted that in addition to the systemic RAAS, several organs, including the adrenal gland [for example, (217) and reviewed in (249)], possess a tissue renin-angiotensin system, such that the expression of renin and angiotensin in these tissues can regulate local

AngII levels in a paracrine manner [reviewed in (336)]. The effects of AngII on aldosterone biosynthesis arise through its binding to a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), the AngII receptor type 1 (AT1R), and details are provided below.

Elevated serum potassium levels also increase aldosterone production in the adrenal gland. This effect of potassium represents an important physiological control mechanism because of the ability of aldosterone to regulate potassium loss in the urine. Thus, aldosterone increases potassium excretion in the kidney connecting tubule and cortical collecting duct by augmenting the activity of both the sodium-potassium ATPase and the amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channel to decrease serum potassium concentrations, concomitant with sodium retention [reviewed in (334)]. Consistent with this key role in assisting in the regulation of potassium homeostasis, the aldosterone-producing cells of the zona glomerulosa appear to be essentially potassium electrodes, such that small changes in extracellular potassium concentration result in corresponding changes in membrane potential [reviewed in (312)]. Elevated potassium thus depolarizes the plasma membrane to activate voltage-dependent calcium channels, and the resulting increase in cytosolic calcium levels triggers aldosterone production by mechanisms involving calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (CaMKs), as well as other signaling pathways, as will be discussed below.

Secreted by the pituitary gland, ACTH has as its primary role the regulation in response to stress of glucocorticoid
production in the zona fasciculata of the adrenal cortex. However, this hormone can also induce aldosterone production in zona glomerulosa cells, although apparently in a transient fashion, as discussed in the section on ACTH signaling. ACTH functions in the zona glomerulosa cell by binding to its GPCR, the melanocortin receptor type 2 (MC2R) and activating, through a stimulatory G protein ($G_{s}$), adenylate cyclase. The signal transduction events activated by ACTH binding to MC2R are described subsequently.

Other regulators of aldosterone production have also been discovered. Most often these additional factors have been demonstrated to stimulate or inhibit aldosterone secretion *in vitro*, and their *in vivo* role, especially in humans, is often less clear. These additional regulators are discussed in the final section.

### Phases of secretion and mechanisms

Aldosterone is produced in the zona glomerulosa cell from precursor cholesterol via a series of enzymatic reactions that occur in the mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The first is a side-chain cleavage reaction catalyzed at the inner mitochondrial membrane by the side-chain cleavage complex, encoded by *CYP11A1*. This cytochrome p450 enzyme catalyzes the addition of two hydroxyl groups to cholesterol as well as the cleavage of the side chain at the bond between carbon 20 and 22 to generate pregnenolone. Electrons supplied by NADPH through adrenodoxin and adrenodoxin reductase are required for these reactions. Pregnenolone is then oxidized at the 3 position to form progesterone by the enzyme 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, the only non-p450 enzyme in the aldosterone biosynthetic pathway. Type 2 (and likely type 1) 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase catalyzes this reaction in the ER of the zona glomerulosa cell (121). Progesterone is then hydroxylated at the 21 position by the microsomal cytochrome p450 enzyme 21-hydroxylase. The final three steps in the synthesis of aldosterone are catalyzed by aldosterone synthase (encoded by the *CYP11B2* gene), a mitochondrial cytochrome p450 enzyme which catalyzes two hydroxylation reactions, first at the 11 position and then at the 18 position followed by oxidation at the 18 position. Aldosterone synthase exhibits high 11β-hydroxylase activity but low processivity, which likely accounts for the low yield of aldosterone produced by this enzyme (323). The complete pathway resulting in aldosterone synthesis is summarized in Figure 2. The two rate-limiting steps in aldosterone biosynthesis occur at the levels of the delivery of cholesterol to the inner mitochondrial membrane, where the side-chain cleavage complex is located, and of the activity of aldosterone synthase (determined essentially by *CYP11B2* expression/levels in humans). The mechanisms regulating the movement of aldosterone precursors between the ER and mitochondria and the release of newly synthesized aldosterone from the cell are not well understood but may occur through passive diffusion. However, as these processes are not rate limiting, they do not generally determine the amount of aldosterone

production/secretion [reviewed in (135)], except in pathological circumstances [reviewed in (212)].

The cholesterol used for aldosterone biosynthesis is provided to the adrenal glomerulosa cell by lipoproteins, including low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) [reviewed in (57, 58)]. Historically, LDL was thought to provide the bulk of cholesterol to glomerulosa cells; however, recent evidence suggests that HDL may also be an important source of cholesterol for aldosterone biosynthesis [reviewed in (279)], depending on the species. Indeed, HDL and LDL have been shown to exhibit essentially equivalent effects in terms of enhancing AngII-induced aldosterone production in one glomerulosa cell model (69). LDL enters the zona glomerulosa cell after binding to the LDL receptor (LDLR), with the LDL/LDLR complex internalized by endocytosis [reviewed in (213)]. LDLR levels appear to be regulated by the cAMP signaling system but not by AngII (69). On the other hand, the scavenger receptor class B type 1 (SRB1) for uptake of cholesterol from HDL is also expressed by adrenal glomerulosa cells, and its levels are increased upon AngII stimulation (69). The adrenal gland also expresses the VLDL receptor (VLDLR) [for example, (146)], and recent evidence suggests that VLDL can also increase aldosterone secretion from glomerulosa cell models (293, 294, 343). However, VLDL may stimulate aldosterone biosynthesis by activating similar signaling pathways to AngII rather than through direct provision of cholesterol, as discussed in the final section. Cholesterol taken up through lipoprotein receptors is used to synthesize aldosterone or is stored as cholesteryl esters in lipid droplets [reviewed in (298)]. Zona glomerulosa cells can also synthesize cholesterol *de novo* from acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA), with the rate-limiting step in this process catalyzed by 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase, as in other cell types [reviewed in (55)].

Aldosterone biosynthesis from its cholesterol precursor, and steroidogenesis in general, requires two distinct processes to occur for maximal secretory rates to be maintained. Since the first enzyme involved in steroid production, *CYP11A1*, also known as the cholesterol side-chain cleavage complex as discussed above, is located inside the mitochondria, cholesterol must first be mobilized to the mitochondria from storage sites in cytosolic lipid droplets (Fig. 2). This first step is thought to be mediated by cytoskeletal rearrangements, particularly actin microfilament changes, that allow juxtaposition of the mitochondria and lipid droplets [reviewed in (106, 131, 298)], as well as activation of cholesterol ester hydrolase (71), the enzyme responsible for converting cholesteryl esters to free cholesterol, identified as hormone-sensitive lipase [reviewed in (178)]. These changes may involve the protein myristoylated alanine-rich C-kinase substrate (MARCKS), which is phosphorylated in glomerulosa cells stimulated with all three major physiological agonists (27). MARCKS can associate with actin filaments and the plasma membrane, and this binding is altered by phosphorylation as well as calmodulin binding [reviewed in (10)]. These cytoskeletal rearrangements allow movement of cholesterol

Figure 2 Aldosterone biosynthesis. (A) In this schematic is shown the enzymatic process through which aldosterone is synthesized from its cholesterol precursor. The steroidogenic process is initiated following the transport of free cholesterol, usually released by cholesterol ester hydrolase (CEH), also known as hormone-sensitive lipase, from cholesteryl esters stored in lipid droplets but also arising from de novo synthesis and uptake from circulating lipoproteins, to the outer mitochondrial membrane. From there the cholesterol is translocated to the inner mitochondrial membrane under the control of the steroidogenic acute regulatory (StAR) protein, which is the early rate-limiting step in steroidogenesis, with the participation of other proteins (see Table 1). CYP11A1, also known as the cholesterol side-chain cleavage complex, located in the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) initiates steroidogenesis by cleaving the side chain of cholesterol to produce pregnenolone. Pregnenolone is then metabolized by 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3βHSD) in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to progesterone, which is, in turn, converted to 11-deoxycorticosterone by 21-hydroxylase (CYP21), also in the ER. Aldosterone synthase, or CYP11B2, then completes the synthesis of aldosterone in the mitochondria by catalyzing an 11β-hydroxylation reaction, followed by the hydroxylation of carbon 18 and subsequent oxidation of the carbon 18-hydroxy group to an aldehyde, to yield aldosterone. (B) Aldosterone biosynthesis is shown with the structure of each steroid illustrated.
to the outer mitochondrial membrane. In addition, recent data also suggest an important role of the intermediate filament protein vimentin in steroidogenesis. Vimentin binds to lipid droplets and to hormone-sensitive lipase and appears to regulate cholesterol delivery to the mitochondria [reviewed in (179)].

The second required event in the initiation of steroid hormone biosynthesis, and one of two key rate-limiting steps in steroidogenesis, involves transfer of the mobilized cholesterol from the outer mitochondrial membrane to the inner mitochondrial membrane, at which site the cholesterol side-chain cleavage complex initiates steroid hormone production. The steroidogenic acute regulatory (StAR) protein is thought to regulate this second transfer step. The importance of StAR for cholesterol transport and steroidogenesis is demonstrated by the human disease lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Individuals with this condition accumulate large deposits of lipid within steroidogenic cells (i.e., adrenocortical and gonadal tissues) but exhibit impaired production of adrenal and gonadal steroid hormones. It has been determined that lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia is caused by mutations in the STAR gene, and the disease can be mimicked by STAR gene deletion in knockout mice [(61) and reviewed in (202)]. Although StAR is thought to play a key role in the translocation of cholesterol from the outer to the inner mitochondrial membrane, the mechanism by which it does so is as yet unclear [reviewed in (279)].

The STAR gene encodes a 37 kDa precursor with a mitochondrial targeting sequence, which may not be required for its action *in vitro* (7, 9) but may be necessary for proper activity in steroidogenic tissues and *in vivo* [(14) and reviewed in (202)]. This 37 kDa precursor is processed to a 32 kDa precursor and finally to a family of approximately 30 kDa mitochondrial proteins with isoelectric points ranging between 6.1 and 6.7 [reviewed in (211, 320)]. The 30 kDa proteins are numbered 1 to 4 beginning from the alkaline isoelectric point, with the two more acidic forms (StAR-3 and -4) representing modification (of StAR-1 and -2) by phosphorylation [reviewed in (320)]. Indeed, it is thought that phosphorylation is important to StAR's function (8), presumably yielding the active form(s) of the protein, with phosphorylation possibly affecting its interaction with mitochondria [reviewed in (155, 202)]. In keeping with this idea, secretion is decreased from steroidogenic cells (a murine Leydig cell model) incubated with amino acid analogs that cannot be phosphorylated (such as D,L-β-hydroxynorvaline and L-homoserine) (321). Similarly, transfection of a mutant STAR gene in which an alanine is substituted for serine 195 to prevent phosphorylation results in a reduced steroidogenic response compared to the normal gene (8). The amino acid residue mutated in this case represents a PKA consensus phosphorylation site (8); since AngII does not increase cAMP levels (54), whether this hormone also utilizes this particular phosphorylation site to alter StAR function is unknown. Although few studies to date have investigated the involvement of the calcium and diacylglycerol-activated signaling pathways in StAR

expression, phosphorylation and function in glomerulosa cells, in Leydig and granulosa cell models it has been shown that the protein kinase C (PKC)-activating phorbol ester, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), increases StAR mRNA and protein levels (151, 203). However, on its own PMA has only a minimal effect to increase steroidogenesis, due to a presumed lack of phosphorylation of the newly synthesized StAR. Upon stimulation with agents that increase cAMP to mimic the effect of gonadotrophic hormones, this StAR is then phosphorylated and activated, resulting in the production of greater amounts of steroid in cells treated with the combination of PMA and cAMP-elevating agonists [e.g., (151, 203) and reviewed in (202)]. Thus, PMA potentiates the effect of cAMP agents on StAR mRNA and protein expression and phosphorylation and synergistically enhances steroidogenesis [e.g., (151, 203) and reviewed in (202)].

In bovine adrenal glomerulosa cells both physiologic (AngII, an elevated potassium concentration and ACTH) and pharmacologic (e.g., phorbol ester) agents induce StAR phosphorylation (28). These results suggest that various agonists that work through different signaling pathways in the zona glomerulosa may have a common ability to increase StAR activity through phosphorylation. On the other hand, both AngII and a cAMP analog, but not PMA or elevated extracellular potassium levels, increase STAR expression in H295R cells through a common SF1 element (74), suggesting potentially different effects of these various pathways on StAR transcription versus phosphorylation.

Cholesterol transport proteins in addition to StAR also appear to be involved in cholesterol movement to and into the mitochondria. For example, data support an important role for the translocator protein TSPO, also known as the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor, and its ligand, the diazepam binding inhibitor also known as ATP-binding cassette, subfamily D, member 1 or ABCD1 (as well as the steroidogenesis activator peptide and the sterol carrier protein-2) in this process [reviewed in (241)]. It is thought that these additional proteins, along with the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC-1), peripheral benzodiazepine receptor-associated protein-7 (PAP7, also known as ATP-binding cassette, subfamily D, member 3 or ABCD3) and protein kinase A regulatory subunit 1α (PKAR1A), form a docking site for StAR on the mitochondrial membrane to allow StAR-mediated cholesterol transport from the outer to the inner mitochondrial membrane [Table 1 and reviewed in (202, 241, 279)]. Nevertheless, the ability to dissect the role of some of these proteins in steroidogenesis *in vivo* has been hampered by early embryonic lethality of the ablation of the genes encoding them. Thus, global deletion of the genes coding for TSPO or steroidogenesis activator peptide, also known as GRP78 or HSPA5, results in an embryonic lethal phenotype (88, 265), an effect that implies a key involvement of these two gene products in embryogenesis. On the other hand, a recently generated Leydig-cell conditional TSPO knockout mouse model exhibits normal testosterone production, both basally and under stimulated conditions, and the authors

conclude that TSPO is not required for steroidogenesis (218), at least in the testis. Clearly, additional research is required to delineate all of the players and their roles in cholesterol transport in zona glomerulosa cells.

The enzyme aldosterone synthase, encoded by CYP11B2, is also required for aldosterone synthesis, as this enzyme catalyzes a series of reactions, initiated with an 11β-hydroxylation followed by the hydroxylation of carbon 18 and subsequent oxidation of the carbon 18-hydroxy group to an aldehyde, to yield aldosterone (Fig. 2). Without this enzyme, aldosterone cannot be produced, and many of the same mechanisms that regulate aldosterone production acutely also regulate the expression of CYP11B2 in the longer term [see below and reviewed in (135)]. In humans CYP11B2 is expressed in the zona glomerulosa, and the enzyme CYP11B1, which produces cortisol through an 11β-hydroxylation reaction, is expressed in the zona fasciculata. It should be noted that unlike humans, not all mammals express two different enzymes synthesizing aldosterone and cortisol. Thus, ungulates such as cows and sheep possess a single CYP11B enzyme that can catalyze both cortisol and aldosterone synthesis (43), although the mechanism by which one or the other steroid hormone is generated is unclear. Mice are similar to humans, possessing both CYP11B1 and CYP11B2, whereas rats have three genes, CYP11B1-3 (and an additional probable pseudogene, CYP11B4) (219). However, the zona fasciculata of rats and mice synthesizes corticosterone rather than cortisol. Thus, in humans the late rate-limiting step for aldosterone production is the activity of aldosterone synthase (CYP11B2), and the levels of this enzyme determine the aldosterone synthetic capacity of the adrenal gland.

### Glomerulosa Cell Models

There are several glomerulosa cell models that have been routinely used to investigate signaling mechanisms mediating adrenal aldosterone production *in vitro* [reviewed in (263, 333)]. These include primary cultures derived from
several animal species, as well as a few cell lines. For example, a large number of studies have been performed in primary cultures of rat or bovine glomerulosa cells. Rat glomerulosa cells have the advantage of expressing a specific aldosterone synthase (encoded by CYP11B2) similar to that in humans, as well as the ability to control diet and fluid intake and to translate results *in vivo*. However, a fairly large number of rats must be sacrificed to generate sufficient numbers of glomerulosa cells for signal transduction experiments. Bovine glomerulosa cells can be isolated from the adrenal glands of animals harvested for meat purposes, and the size of the glands allows the collection of sizeable numbers of cells. These cells also can secrete large quantities of aldosterone both when freshly isolated and in primary culture, although inconsistencies in the diet and conditions encountered by the animals prior to euthanasia can result in variability in the response to aldosterone agonists. Also, and as noted above, these cells possess only a single enzyme synthesizing both aldosterone and cortisol and are inappropriate for investigating the mechanisms regulating CYP11B2 expression, the late rate-limiting step of aldosterone biosynthesis in humans. Mouse glomerulosa cells in capsular preparations have been used to study the biology of potassium channels by electrophysiological techniques (142), but extreme difficulties are encountered in isolating sufficient cells for measuring aldosterone production or performing other signal transduction studies because of the small size of the adrenal gland in these animals. Human adrenocortical cells have also been isolated from human adrenal glands obtained during kidney transplantation. Because these glands are usually obtained from patients on the typical high-sodium western diet, the zona glomerulosa (and the RAAS in general) tends to be suppressed, and it can be difficult to obtain purified glomerulosa cells in sufficient quantities for signaling studies. In addition, in humans zona glomerulosa cells, as defined by their CYP11B2 protein expression, do not appear to be localized in a discrete layer underneath the capsule as in rodents, but instead are found as small clusters or as individual cells scattered in the outer portion of the adrenal cortex (121). This lack of delineation makes isolation of human zona glomerulosa cells by simple dissection difficult, requiring some sort of additional isolation procedure for purification [e.g., (60)]. Alternatively, mixed adrenocortical cells may be used but since fasciculata/reticularis cells comprise the majority of the adrenal cortex, these cells are largely not of the zona glomerulosa phenotype.

Several cell lines have also been used to study the regulation of adrenal aldosterone production *in vitro*. One such cell line is the mouse Y-1 adrenocortical cell line, which has been used to investigate the regulation of adrenocortical cell proliferation [reviewed in (194, 275)] and ACTH-induced steroidogenesis [reviewed in (233)] and gene expression (295). These cells are also amenable to manipulation by genetic approaches. However, although these cells seem to behave similarly to normal adrenocortical cells, they are derived from tumor cells and exhibit dysregulation of the protooncogene c-myc (194). In addition, they do not regulate

the expression of CYP11B2 appropriately (25) and do not respond to AngII [reviewed in (263)]. Therefore, these cells are not particularly useful for investigating AngII-stimulated aldosterone biosynthesis or the regulation of the late rate-limiting step in aldosterone production, CYP11B2 expression. On the other hand, a human adrenocortical carcinoma cell line developed by Rainey and colleagues (from cells originally obtained from American Tissue Culture Collection) termed the NCI H295R cell line has proven very useful for studies of signal transduction pathways regulating CYP11B2 expression and aldosterone production [(31) and reviewed in (332)]. These cells have the capacity to produce all of the steroids generated by the adrenal cortex and so can be used as models of the zona reticularis, the zona fasciculata and the zona glomerulosa [reviewed in (263)]. They have the advantage that they are human in origin, exhibit responsiveness to multiple aldosterone agonists and have the capacity to produce large numbers of cells by expansion in culture. However, they are derived from an adrenocortical carcinoma, and so they are likely genomically unstable with abnormal growth regulation. Also, and as mentioned above, the H295R cells appear to be dedifferentiated, in that with the proper stimuli they are able to synthesize all of the adrenocortical steroids: aldosterone as in the zona glomerulosa, cortisol from the zona fasciculata and adrenal androgens as in the zona reticularis (31, 261, 262). In these cells then (and the HAC15 clonal cell line derived from them, as discussed below), the events controlling StAR are likely not specific to the regulation of aldosterone production but may be equally involved in the production of cortisol and adrenal androgens. Finally, H295R cells generally exhibit low expression of CYP11B2 basally; therefore, they are relatively poor models for examining acute aldosterone secretion. Nevertheless, CYP11B2 expression can be induced, and these cells represent an excellent model with which to investigate the regulation of this process. Indeed, those signaling pathways shown to induce the expression of CYP11B2, but not CYP11B1, are important for determining the aldosterone synthetic capacity of the adrenal gland. A recently isolated clone of the H295R cells, termed the HAC15 cell line, exhibits greater responsiveness to ACTH (243) and an enhanced (and persistent) ability to produce aldosterone (333), and these characteristics seem to be contributing to its adoption as a glomerulosa model system.

### AngII-Induced Signal Transduction Mechanisms Through the AngII Receptor, AT1R

Glomerulosa cells express two or three AngII receptors, depending on the species. In species such as rodents, cattle and humans, there are two types of AngII receptors, the type 1 (AT1R) and the type 2 (AT2R) receptor [reviewed in (314)]. In rodents the AT1R is further subdivided into two subtypes, types 1A and 1B, which are highly homologous (approximately 94% sequence homology) (328). In the rat adrenalgland the zona glomerulosa demonstrates detectable levels of both AT1RA and AT1RB (255). In humans AT1R predominates in the adult zona glomerulosa, although in fetal adrenal glands AT2R represents the majority of the AngII binding sites, including in the glomerulosa layer (47). Most of the effects of AngII on glomerulosa cell functions, such as aldosterone production and proliferation, occur through the AT1R (229). Indeed, in addition to activation of the renin-AngII system, a low-sodium diet leads to upregulation of AT1R levels (187), both of which effects represent a physiological response to allow increased aldosterone production and sodium retention with low sodium intake. A low-sodium diet also induces hyperplasia of the zona glomerulosa [e.g., (187, 208)] further contributing to sodium retention under these conditions. The role of the AT2R is less clear, as discussed below, although AT2R is reported to underlie the production of endogenous ouabain by glomerulosa cells (301, 302).

AngII binds to AT1R on the zona glomerulosa cells and stimulates through a G protein several signal transduction pathways. One pathway activated upon binding of AngII to AT1R is a phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C-β (PLCβ), which hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP₂) to generate the two second messengers, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP₃) and diacylglycerol [reviewed in (15)]. IP₃ is thought to initiate aldosterone production by eliciting a transient increase in the cytosolic calcium concentration and activating calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (CaMKs), whereas diacylglycerol functions to stimulate protein kinase C (PKC) (and other effectors; see below). There are additional pathways activated by AngII binding to the AT1R through mechanisms that will be discussed in subsequent sections: for instance, there is an increase in calcium influx, with this enhancement acting synergistically with PKC-activating agents to stimulate aldosterone secretion [see below and reviewed in (15)]. Indeed, this calcium influx is essential for a continued aldosterone secretory response [reviewed in (15)] and for regulating PKC activity (164), such that preventing the influx with calcium-free medium or voltage-dependent calcium antagonists inhibits sustained aldosterone secretion [e.g., (167,171)]. Another signaling system activated by AngII, through a partially defined mechanism (40, 258, 350), is phospholipase D (PLD), which can also increase diacylglycerol (indirectly) and presumably activate PKC (36, 40) (Fig. 3). These pathways are also described below. Additional signaling pathways to be discussed in subsequent sections include mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and tyrosine kinases.

### AT1R regulation by β-arrestin, G protein-coupled receptor kinases, internalization, and recycling

Upon binding of AngII the AT1R “desensitizes,” to exhibit reduced affinity for the ligand. This desensitization appears to represent an uncoupling of the receptor from the G protein (45) possibly as a result of phosphorylation by a GPCR kinase (311). The receptor is then internalized and can either be recycled back to the plasma membrane or diverted to lysosomes for degradation [reviewed in (145)]. Data from bovine glomerulosa cells suggest that the AT1R in these cells is rapidly recycled back to the plasma membrane (144, 268), such that short term there is no decrease in the number of AngII binding sites on glomerulosa cell plasma membranes (unless the cells are maintained at ice-cold temperatures to prevent return of the receptor to the plasma membrane) (268). Over time, however, “homologous downregulation” occurs, resulting in a reduction in the number of cell receptors, with a half-life of approximately 8 to 10 h (247). Heterologous downregulation can also occur following glomerulosa cell stimulation with other hormones such as ACTH (247).

In other cell types it has been determined that AT1R can interact with β-arrestin and that this association not only can trigger internalization but also can in some cases activate certain signaling pathways [reviewed in (145, 329)]. Similarly, in H295R cells *in vitro* overexpressed wild-type β-arrestin enhances, and dominant-negative β-arrestin reduces, AngII-induced StAR protein levels and aldosterone production (200). Similar results were observed with an AngII analog ([Sar¹,Ile⁴,Ile⁸]AngII) that triggers β-arrestin signaling but not G protein coupling to AT1R. Likewise, in these cells overexpression of wild-type β-arrestin enhances, and dominant-negative β-arrestin inhibits, the MAPK culminating in the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway, suggesting that AngII exerts its effects on this signaling system through β-arrestin (200). These effects of β-arrestin also translate to the *in vivo* situation: when β-arrestin is overexpressed specifically in the adrenal gland using adenovirus transduction, plasma aldosterone levels are increased (200). [A similar but smaller increase in plasma aldosterone is observed with adrenal gland-specific overexpression of the G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2), which phosphorylates AT1R and allows its interaction with β-arrestin (200).] These results suggest a potentially important role for AT1R recycling and interaction with β-arrestin in regulating aldosterone production in the zona glomerulosa both *in vitro* and *in vivo*.

## G Protein Coupling

GPCRs couple to their signaling pathways through heterotrimeric G proteins, so-called because they are composed of three subunits, an α, β, and γ subunit. When a GPCR binds its agonist, the resultant conformational change stimulates the α subunit of the G protein to exchange GDP for GTP (a process which can be enhanced by guanine nucleotide exchange factors or GEFs). The GTP-bound α subunit then dissociates from βγ and activates the appropriate effector enzyme, with the βγ subunits also able to modulate certain signaling pathways [reviewed in (96)]. The α subunit possesses intrinsic GTPase activity and hydrolyzes GTP to GDP; this hydrolysis can be accelerated by GTPase-activating proteins or GAPs. The inactive GDP-bound α subunit then reassociates with βγ

Regulation of Aldosterone Synthesis and Secretion

![Diagram](#)

Figure 3 Angiotensin II (AngII) signaling mediating aldosterone secretion from adrenal glomerulosa cells. AngII binds to the AngII receptor, type 1 (AT1R), which is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) coupled through the heterotrimeric G protein, $G_{q/11}$, to phospholipase C-$\beta$ (PLC$\beta$). PLC$\beta$ hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate ($PIP_2$) to yield inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate ($IP_3$) and diacylglycerol (DAG). $IP_3$ binds to $IP_3$ receptors on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to release this intracellular store of calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$). The resulting increase in cytosolic calcium levels activates calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (CaMK), which phosphorylates substrates controlling various cellular processes to initiate the steroidogenic response. Diacylglycerol, on the other hand, activates protein kinase C (PKC) isoenzymes, which can activate other effectors such as phospholipase D (PLD), to sustain the aldosterone secretory response. PLD hydrolyzes phosphatidylcholine to generate phosphatidic acid (PA), which can be dephosphorylated by lipid phosphate phosphatases to yield diacylglycerol. The other signal required for sustained aldosterone secretion is an enhanced influx of calcium, which enters the cell through store-operated calcium influx pathways and voltage-dependent calcium channels. AngII also depolarizes the glomerulosa cell [i.e., the membrane potential ($V_m$) is decreased] by inhibiting the activity of potassium channels and activates, through as yet unclear mechanisms, mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways ending in extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and p38, as well as tyrosine kinases, such as Src and Janus kinase-2 (JAK2). ERK can phosphorylate and activate cholesterol ester hydrolase to cleave cholesteryl esters stored in lipid droplets (LD) and increase free cholesterol available to serve as a precursor for steroidogenesis. On the other hand, Src family kinases, together with PKC, induce the transphosphorylation and activation of protein kinase D (PKD), which phosphorylates and activates activating transcription factor (ATF)/cAMP response element binding (CREB) protein transcription factors to induce the expression of steroidogenic acute regulatory (StAR) protein (see Fig. 6), the early rate-limiting step in steroidogenesis. CaMK is also able to increase the phosphorylation and activation of ATF/CREB transcription factors. These factors can also stimulate the expression of aldosterone synthase, or CYP11B2, the late rate-limiting step in aldosterone production. Together, these signal transduction pathways increase the production of aldosterone.

and is ready for the next round of activation initiated by the binding of ligand to the GPCR (Fig. 4).

The heterotrimeric G protein that couples the AT1R to its effector phospholipase C-$\beta$ (PLC$\beta$) is $G_{q/11}$, a G protein that is insensitive to pertussis toxin, a bacterial protein that catalyzes the ADP-ribosylation of the $\alpha$ subunit of $G_i$ and inactivates this G protein by preventing the exchange of GDP for GTP on the $\alpha_i$ subunit. Activation of $PIP_2$-hydrolyzing PLC$\beta$ by the GTP-bound $G_{q/11}$ $\alpha$ subunit results in the production of the two second messengers $IP_3$ and diacylglycerol. In zona glomerulosa cells the $\alpha$ subunit has also been reported to inhibit the activity of a calcium-activated potassium channel (244), which should depolarize the cell (see below). The $\beta\gamma$ subunit complex may also exert its own effects as in other systems [reviewed in (96)], although no specific targets have been described to date in glomerulosa cells. The AT1R also appears to couple to pertussis toxin-sensitive $G_i$, which can inhibit adenylate cyclase to result in a reduction in cellular cAMP levels. $G_i$ also interacts with T-type calcium channels to enhance their activity, thereby presumably increasing calcium influx at physiologically relevant membrane potentials [(197) and see below].

The regulators of G protein signaling or RGS proteins represent one type of GAP and are known to modulate AT1R

Regulation of Aldosterone Synthesis and Secretion

IP₃ binds to receptors on the ER and releases calcium ions from this calcium store to increase intracellular calcium levels. Although the cytosolic calcium rise is transient (see below), phosphoinositide hydrolysis appears to be sustained (also see below). Thus, in primary cultures of bovine adrenal glomerulosa cells sustained diacylglycerol generation is accompanied by a maintained production of inositol phosphates (143). Incubation of these cells in a medium lacking calcium inhibits both this sustained inositol phosphates generation and aldosterone synthesis in response to AngII (but only partially inhibits diacylglycerol production) (143).

Upon its generation IP₃ is phosphorylated at the 3-position by an IP₃ kinase to yield inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate (IP₄). IP₄ is reported to exert multiple effects in other cell types, including modulating calcium metabolism, vesicle trafficking, and cytoskeletal remodeling [reviewed in (210, 341)], although its possible role in zona glomerulosa cells is unknown. IP₄ is then dephosphorylated at the 5-position to produce inactive inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate, which is further metabolized to inositol 1,4-bisphosphate, inositol 4-phosphate (11) and inositol. This sugar is then recycled back into phosphatidylinositol (PI); PI is in turn rephosphorylated by phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase (PIP) to phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate, which is phosphorylated by phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase to PIP₂ to await the next AngII/AT1R-induced PLCβ activation event. Because PI, PIP, and PIP₂, as well as the various inositol phosphates, are readily and rapidly interconverted, it is not entirely clear whether only PIP₂ is hydrolyzed or whether hydrolysis of other phosphoinositides may also occur during stimulation of the AT1R by AngII in zona glomerulosa cells, particularly with longer hormone exposures.

**Figure 4** The heterotrimeric G protein cycle. Heterotrimeric G proteins, such as the Gα₁₁ utilized by the AT1R, are composed of three subunits, α, β, and γ. Activation by G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) like the AT1R triggers the α subunit to exchange GDP for GTP, a process that can be accelerated/enhanced by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs). This then allows the GTP-bound α subunit to dissociate from the βγ subunits and associate with effector enzymes such as PLCβ. With time, the intrinsic GTPase activity of the α subunit hydrolyzes GTP to GDP, allowing its reassociation with the βγ subunits and terminating G protein-mediated activation of its effector enzymes. This process can be accelerated by GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs).

In the rat adrenal gland RGS4 is expressed predominantly in the zona glomerulosa and is upregulated by a low-salt diet and AngII infusion *in vivo* (278). In the H295R glomerulosa cell model *in vitro*, AngII dose and time dependently increases RGS4 mRNA levels by mechanisms involving calcium influx as well as CaMK and PKC activities (278). Overexpression of RGS4 in H295R cells inhibits AngII-induced aldosterone production without altering the responsiveness of the cell (278). Thus, it appears that RGS4 serves as a negative feedback mechanism to fine-tune the glomerulosa cell steroidogenic response to AngII.

Another RGS protein RGS2 has also been found in the human adrenal gland *in situ* (276). In H295R cells *in vitro* AngII stimulates RGS2 mRNA and protein expression, as does an elevated extracellular potassium level (276). The AngII-(and potassium-) induced increase in RGS2 expression is reduced by inhibitors of calcium signaling (i.e., inhibitors of calcium influx, of calmodulin and of CaMK) but not inhibitors of PKC signaling. Overexpression of RGS2 inhibits AngII-induced aldosterone production, but not cortisol synthesis, decreasing the maximal aldosterone secretory rate without affecting the responsiveness to AngII (276), similarly to the results observed with RGS4 (278). Thus, RGS2, like RGS4, appears to act as a negative feedback mechanism to attenuate AT1R signaling and aldosterone synthesis. Whether other GAPs, or for that matter GEFs, modulate AT1R activation and steroidogenesis in the zona glomerulosa cell remains to be determined.

### Phospholipase C and phosphoinositide hydrolysis

AngII/AT1R-activated Gα₁₁ couples to and activates PLCβ, which hydrolyzes PIP₂ to generate IP₃ and diacylglycerol.

**IP₃ and cytosolic calcium**

Activation of PLCβ by AngII and the resultant hydrolysis of PIP₂ result in the generation of two second messengers, IP₃ and diacylglycerol. The first of these, IP₃, diffuses from its membrane production site and binds to IP₃ receptors located on the ER, the site of storage of an intracellular pool of calcium ions [reviewed in (314)]. There are three identified IP₃ receptor isoforms, IP₃R1, IP₃R2, and IP₃R3, and adrenal zona glomerulosa cells express all three, although IP₃R1 is reported to be the most abundant in rat glomerulosa cells [(102) and reviewed in (314)]. Upon binding IP₃, these receptors act as channels to release calcium ions from the ER storage site. The result is an increase in cytosolic calcium levels; however, this increase is transient only, at least when measured in a population of cells, as various calcium transport mechanisms exist to return the cytosolic calcium concentration to basal (or near-basal) values. Thus, pumps in the plasma membrane as well as those in the ER, the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic calcium ATPase (SERCA), transport calcium ions out of the cytoplasm, and studies with radiolabeled calcium have shown that AngII (and elevated extracellular potassium levels) increase the efflux of calcium from bovine zona glomerulosa cells.
(167). In addition, calcium transport mechanisms in the mitochondria move calcium into this organelle from the cytosol. Indeed, changes in cytosolic calcium concentration appear to be mirrored by similar alterations in mitochondrial calcium levels [(46, 183) and reviewed in (287, 313)]. This coupling has been hypothesized to play a vital role in steroidogenesis, in part by increasing mitochondrial levels of NADPH [reviewed in (313)], which is required for multiple steps in steroid biosynthesis [reviewed in (245)].

AngII has also been reported to induce cytosolic calcium oscillations, with individual zona glomerulosa cells exhibiting different patterns of these oscillations [(259, 290) and reviewed in (314)]. Calcium oscillations may result from interactions between the calcium release and calcium extrusion pathways and by positive and negative feedback effects exerted by calcium, especially in terms of the biphasic actions of this ion on IP₃ receptor activity [reviewed in (314)]. In addition, recent results in mouse zona glomerulosa cells suggest that the cells are electrically excitable, demonstrating intrinsic electrical oscillatory behavior [(142) and reviewed in (127)], which could also contribute to corresponding changes in calcium influx through voltage-dependent calcium channels (see below) and thus cytosolic calcium levels. Nevertheless, in general, these results have not been correlated to effects on aldosterone production (142).

Increased intracellular calcium levels activate effector enzymes, often by binding to the calcium-binding protein calmodulin. Particularly important effectors are the calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinases (CaMKs), and in particular CaMKI and CaMKII {and perhaps CaMKIV [reviewed in (24)]}, which have been reported to play key roles in regulating AngII-elicited aldosterone production. Thus, both calmodulin inhibitors and CaMK inhibitors are quite efficacious in decreasing AngII-induced aldosterone production and CYP11B2 expression in multiple glomerulosa cell models [e.g., (117, 250)]. CaMKI (and perhaps CaMKIV) is thought to mediate AngII's induction of CYP11B2 expression in human adrenocortical carcinoma cell lines to increase the aldosterone synthetic capacity of the zona glomerulosa (80). CaMKII, on the other hand, has been shown to be activated by AngII in bovine glomerulosa cells and to phosphorylate and shift the voltage dependence of activation of the low-voltage activated transient-type (T-type) calcium channels to more negative potentials (104, 198). This shift should enhance calcium influx and aldosterone synthesis (see below). In addition, emptying of the ER calcium store appears to activate store-operated calcium (SOC) entry, as discussed below.

### Diacylglycerol and effectors

The other second messenger produced by PLCβ's action on PIP₂ is diacylglycerol. Diacylglycerol production by the AngII-activated AT1R is sustained (38, 143) and in bovine zona glomerulosa cells is reported to exhibit a biphasic time course, with an initial increase correlating with the initial rise in IP₃ levels and a later sustained rise (143). This later increase may be related to continued phosphoinositide turnover (see above) or may be the result of the activation of PLD, a second phospholipid-metabolizing enzyme that hydrolyzes phosphatidylcholine to yield choline and phosphatic acid, which can in turn be dephosphorylated to diacylglycerol (see below). Indeed, the likely contribution of PLD to AngII-induced diacylglycerol generation is supported by the finding that in bovine zona glomerulosa cells both arachidonic acid, which is enriched in phosphoinositides, and myristic acid, incorporated primarily into phosphatidylcholine, are found in this diacylglycerol (38). In addition, AngII causes the release of choline and its metabolites from AngII-stimulated bovine glomerulosa cells (38), providing evidence for phosphatidylcholine hydrolysis in response to AngII in addition to the observed phosphoinositide turnover.

The arachidonate-containing diacylglycerol derived from phosphoinositide hydrolysis also appears to serve as the precursor for an additional signal promoting aldosterone biosynthesis. Thus, Nadler and colleagues have determined that in various glomerulosa cell models stimulated with AngII, a diacylglycerol lipase releases arachidonic acid from the agonist-generated diacylglycerol, and this arachidonate is converted by 12-lipoxygenase to 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12-HETE) (220, 227). Indeed, AngII increases 12-HETE levels (220), and in turn, 12-HETE underlies, at least in part, AngII-elicted aldosterone production in multiple glomerulosa models. Evidence to support this idea includes the ability of both a diacylglycerol lipase inhibitor and a lipoxygenase inhibitor to reduce AngII-induced steroidogenesis in rat and human glomerulosa cells (220, 226, 227). [Note that these inhibitors have no effect on aldosterone production induced by ACTH or an elevated extracellular potassium concentration, suggesting that the inhibition of AngII-induced steroidogenesis is not the result of nonspecific cytotoxicity.] Similarly, direct application of 12-HETE, but not 15-HETE or 5-HETE [which actually inhibits aldosterone secretion (269, 318)], can elicit aldosterone production in various glomerulosa cell models (220, 319), by a mechanism involving increased cytosolic calcium concentration, the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) p38 (see below), PKC, and cAMP response element binding (CREB) protein (126, 224, 228, 319). Arachidonate may also be released by the activity of phospholipase A₂, and exogenous phospholipase A₂ has been found to stimulate aldosterone secretion from bovine adrenal glomerulosa cells (169).

Diacylglycerol functions to stimulate PKC, the activity of which has been suggested to underlie sustained aldosterone secretion from glomerulosa cells [reviewed in (15, 267, 303)]. Indeed, AngII activates PKC in glomerulosa cell models (164, 185, 224). However, the exact role of PKC in steroidogenesis continues to remain controversial. Some investigators have demonstrated an ability of the PKC-activating phorbol ester, PMA to stimulate aldosterone secretion from freshly isolated or primary cultures of rat and bovine adrenal glomerulosa and H295R cells (27, 42, 156, 165, 173, 222), and a selective PKC inhibitor has been shown to inhibit AngII-induced secretion from rat and bovine adrenal glomerulosa
Regulation of Aldosterone Synthesis and Secretion

cells (157, 164). However, other investigators have been unable to demonstrate a steroidogenic effect of phorbol esters in rat or bovine glomerulosa cells or the H295R cell line (32, 117, 129). Indeed, some investigators believe PKC exerts a negative feedback effect on steroidogenesis [(6, 129) and reviewed in (314)], using as an example the fact that treatment of rat zona glomerulosa cells with the nonspecific PKC inhibitor staurosporine enhances the subsequent aldosterone secretory response to AngII (129). Therefore, the exact role of diacylglycerol and PKC in the regulation of aldosterone secretion is unclear.

A possible explanation for the discrepancy between results from various laboratories arises from the fact that PKC is a family of different isoenzymes. PKC isoforms are divided into three subtypes—classical (also called conventional), novel, and atypical. The classical isoenzymes, which include PKC-α, -βI, -βII, and -γ, are activated by phospholipids, diacylglycerol and calcium; the novel isoforms are activated by phospholipids and diacylglycerol but not calcium and comprise PKC-δ, -ε, -η, and -θ. The third subtype is the atypical PKC isoforms, the activity of which is stimulated by phospholipid but insensitive to calcium or diacylglycerol; the isoforms representing the atypical PKCs are PKC-ι/λ and -ζ. An additional protein kinase originally identified as a novel PKC, PKC-μ, has subsequently been characterized as the first member of the protein kinase D (PKD) family [see below and reviewed in (292)]. The members of this family have some characteristics of the PKC isoforms, for example, cysteine-rich C1 domains that bind diacylglycerol and phorbol esters, but their catalytic domains are more homologous to those of the CaMK family members [reviewed in (292)]. The structural domains of the PKC isoenzymes and PKD are shown in Figure 5.

Glomerulosa cell models express several members of the PKC isoenzyme family. Rat glomerulosa cells are reported to express PKC-α and -ε but not PKC-β nor -γ (224), whereas bovine zona glomerulosa cells express PKC-α and -δ (although other isoforms were not examined) (49). In H295R cells overexpression of constitutively active PKC-α, -ε, and -θ decreases CYP11B2 expression, whereas dominant-negative versions enhance expression (188). On the other hand, constitutively active PKC-ζ, an atypical PKC that is insensitive to diacylglycerol, increases CYP11B2 expression (188). This result indicates that certain PKC isoforms exert inhibitory effects on CYP11B2 expression and presumably aldosterone production, although other data suggest a possible stimulatory role of some of these same PKC isoforms (224). In addition, PKC-ε has been shown to underlie AngII-induced PKD activation; since PKD activity mediates aldosterone production in both primary cultures of bovine zona glomerulosa cells and the human H295R cells (277, 304), as well as CYP11B2 expression in the human cells (277) (see below), it is somewhat difficult to entirely reconcile the inhibitory effects observed with PKC-ε overexpression.

An additional potential reason for the differential effects of diacylglycerol/phorbol ester relates to the ability of these

![Figure 5](#fig5)

**Figure 5** The diacylglycerol-activated protein kinases, protein kinase C (PKC), and protein kinase D (PKD). Shown is a schematic depicting the PKC isoenzyme and PKD domain structures. The PKC isoenzymes consist of the classical or conventional PKCs, with two cysteine-rich domains (C1) that bind diacylglycerol (or phorbol esters), a C2 domain that associates with acidic phospholipids like phosphatidylserine upon binding of calcium and the C3 and C4 domains that comprise the catalytic domain and bind substrate (C4) and ATP (C3). Classical PKC isoforms include PKC-α, -βI, -βII, and -γ and require acidic phospholipids, diacylglycerol, and calcium for full activity. The novel PKC isoenzymes also possess two C1 domains and a C3 and a C4 domain, but instead of a C2 domain, these isoforms possess a C2-like (C2L) domain that does not require calcium to bind acidic phospholipids. For this reason the novel PKCs, which include PKC-δ, -ε, -η, and -θ, do not require calcium for activity but are activated by acidic phospholipids and diacylglycerol. Atypical PKC isoenzymes have a C3 and C4 domain, no C2 domain and only one C1 domain. These isoforms, which comprise PKC-ι/λ and -ζ, are unable to bind or become activated by diacylglycerol or phorbol ester and are unresponsive to calcium but require acidic phospholipids. All PKC isoenzymes also possess a pseudosubstrate (PS) domain, not possessed by PKD family members, which include PKD-1 (also known as PKC-μ), -2 and -3 (also known as PKC-ν). PKD isoforms possess two C1 domains homologous to those in classical and novel PKC isoenzymes (although separated by a longer intervening sequence than in PKC isoenzymes), as well as a catalytic domain composed of a C3 and C4 domain, with the catalytic domain exhibiting more homology to CaMKs than to PKC isoforms. In addition, PKD isoforms have an N-terminal hydrophobic domain (HD) of unknown function and a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, which acts as a protein interaction domain.

agents to bind to and activate effectors in addition to PKC [reviewed in (50)]. Thus, diacylglycerol (and phorbol ester) can also activate proteins such as Ras-guanyl nucleotide releasing protein (RasGRP), the Unc-13 proteins and chimaerins. RasGRP is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for the small GTPase Ras, an upstream activator of the ERK-1/2 MAPK pathway. The importance of this pathway to aldosterone synthesis (see below) suggests the possibility that effects of diacylglycerol on this protein might modulate steroidogenesis. Unc-13 proteins are involved in synaptic vesicle exocytosis, in particular synaptic vesicle priming. Some forms are also expressed in kidney cortical epithelial cells where they are able to sensitize cells to hyperglycemia-induced apoptosis through a diacylglycerol-activated, PKC-independent mechanism [reviewed in (331)]. Chimaerins are GTPase-activating proteins for the small GTP-binding protein Rac, involved in regulating actin filaments and motility [reviewed in (344)]. Whether or not the RasGRPs, Uncs, or chimaerins are expressed in glomerulosa cells and influence steroidogenesis is currently unknown.

Figure 6 Protein kinase D (PKD) activation in adrenal glomerulosa cells. PKD is activated by Src family kinase-induced and PKC-mediated transphosphorylation in glomerulosa cells. In H295R cells the PKC isoform catalyzing this transphosphorylation is PKC-ε. Also upstream of PKD is the enzyme phospholipase D (PLD), which produces the lipid second messengers phosphatidic acid and diacylglycerol, the latter in conjunction with the activity of lipid phosphate phosphatases. In primary bovine glomerulosa cells, PKD then (whether directly or indirectly) phosphorylates and activates members of the activating transcription factor (ATF)/cAMP-dependent response element binding protein (CREB) family of transcription factors to increase the transcription of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR). Increased transcription of StAR, as the rate-limiting step in acute aldosterone production, allows enhanced aldosterone biosynthesis and secretion. In the H295R cells PKD also stimulates CYP11B2 expression, which as the late rate-limiting enzyme in long-term aldosterone production, also increases the synthesis of this steroid.

Another diacylglycerol effector enzyme is the serine/threonine protein kinase, PKD. In many systems PKD is downstream of PKC and can be activated by PKC-mediated transphosphorylation [reviewed in (39, 291)]. Evidence suggests that this is true in glomerulosa cells as well (238, 277). In H295R cells the PKC isoform that regulates PKD is PKC-ε (277). PKD can also be activated by Src/Abl tyrosine kinase-mediated transphosphorylation in zona glomerulosa cells (238), as in other cell types [reviewed in (39, 322)]. PKD can also bind and be activated by diacylglycerol or phorbol esters. Indeed, binding of diacylglycerol is in some cases required for maximal activity (339), which may explain the requirement for PLD activity for maximal PKD activation in response to AngII in bovine zona glomerulosa and HAC15 human adrenocortical carcinoma cells (237) (see below). Results in primary cultures of bovine adrenal glomerulosa cells and human adrenocortical carcinoma H295R cells indicate that PKD also underlies aldosterone production (65, 277, 304), such that siRNA-mediated knockdown or inhibition of its activity with a dominant-negative PKD mutant decreases AngII-induced aldosterone production, and constitutively active PKD mutants enhance steroidogenesis. In the H295R cells PKD increases aldosterone synthesis by upregulating CYP11B2 expression (277). In bovine zona glomerulosa cells STAR expression is enhanced by PKD's effects on

Figure 7 Sustained AngII-induced aldosterone secretion requires continued calcium influx. Shown is a schematic illustrating the requirement for continued calcium influx for sustained aldosterone secretion in response to AngII. Whereas under normal physiological conditions AngII elicits a monotonic and sustained increase in aldosterone secretion, in the presence of a calcium channel antagonist such as nitrendipine (NTR) or upon removal of extracellular calcium, AngII induces only a transient increase in aldosterone secretion that returns to basal values over time.

the phosphorylation and activation of transcription factors of the CREB protein family (236) (Fig. 6).

### Calcium influx, calcium channels, and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases

Another signaling pathway activated by AngII in zona glomerulosa cells is calcium influx, and this influx is essential for sustained aldosterone production in response to AngII [reviewed in (15, 314)]. Thus, inhibition of calcium influx through removal of extracellular calcium or the use of inhibitors has little effect on the initial acute aldosterone secretory response to AngII, but significantly inhibits sustained secretion [for example, (167, 171) and reviewed in (15, 314)], as illustrated in Figure 7. These manipulations have been found to inhibit many of the signal transduction mechanisms elicited by AngII, including inositol phosphates generation and PKC (164) and PLD (258) activation, suggesting that continued calcium influx is required for maintenance of various aspects of AngII signaling.

Calcium ions appear to enter the glomerulosa cell through multiple mechanisms, many of which are activated by AngII. These mechanisms include SOC influx and the related calcium release-activated calcium (CRAC) entry, or so-called capacitative calcium influx, as well as calcium influx through plasma membrane voltage-dependent calcium channels. SOC influx is stimulated by the IP3-induced emptying of the intracellular calcium store in the ER in response to AngII exposure and may be maintained by the sustained generation of inositol phosphates (see above). Pharmacologically, SOC can be activated by thapsigargin, a sesquiterpene lactone extracted from the plant, *Thapsia garganica*. This agent inhibits SERCA pumps to prevent refilling of the ER store as calcium ions

leak out, thereby resulting in the eventual discharge of the store and stimulation of SOC. Indeed, thapsigargin has been demonstrated to increase intracellular calcium concentrations in multiple studies [e.g., (5, 54, 130, 317)]. Thapsigargin also may modulate aldosterone production in zona glomerulosa cells (130); however, in some cases thapsigargin (at a lower concentration) has been reported to enhance AngII-induced aldosterone biosynthesis in rat zona glomerulosa cells (130), whereas in another study the agent (at a higher dose) was shown to have no effect on the steroidogenic response to AngII in bovine cells (258). In addition, agents that inhibit capacitative calcium influx also inhibit AngII-induced aldosterone production in bovine adrenal glomerulosa cells with similar relative potencies (5). Finally, both AngII and thapsigargin have been found to potentiate ACTH-induced cAMP formation in bovine zona glomerulosa cells (54). These results suggest the possible importance of capacitative calcium influx in AngII’s aldosterone biosynthetic response and modulation of steroidogenesis induced by other aldosterone secretagogues.

The archetypical SOC pathway is CRAC, mediated in other tissues by an interaction between Stim1 in the plasma membrane and Orai1 in the ER [reviewed in (254)]. This interaction allows the flow of extracellular calcium ions through the plasma membrane into the ER, where continued IP₃ production presumably mediates calcium release into the cytoplasm. However, it is not known whether these proteins play a similar role in AngII-elicited changes in intracellular calcium levels and aldosterone production in zona glomerulosa cells. Also, in other cell types SOC exhibits heterogeneous characteristics and SOC influx may occur through additional channel proteins such as transient receptor potential channels [reviewed in (254)]. Again, the roles of these additional channels have not been studied in adrenal glomerulosa cells to date.

Calcium influx supporting aldosterone production also occurs through voltage-dependent calcium channels. Zona glomerulosa cells express two types of channels, the low voltage-activated transient (T)-type channels and the high voltage-activated long-lasting (L)-type channels. Although T-type channels are so named because they inactivate rapidly at depolarized membrane potentials, they deactivate slowly. Thus, there is a narrow range of membrane potentials at which some proportion of channels are activated (i.e., open) but not yet deactivated or inactivated, so that calcium ions will be carried into the cell in the steady state through these channels. In other words, there is a range of relatively negative membrane potentials at which there is a “window current” of calcium entry through T-type channels (Fig. 8). In bovine zona glomerulosa cells AngII has been found to shift the voltage dependence of T-channel activation to more negative potentials with no change in the voltage dependence of inactivation; this shift would be predicted to allow greater channel activity and calcium ion entry (i.e., a larger window current; Fig. 8) at more negative membrane potentials (78, 197). However, interestingly, in these same cells another laboratory has reported the exact opposite result that AngII inhibits T-type channels, and calcium entry through these

![Figure 8](#fig8)

**Figure 8** Under physiological conditions, low-voltage-activated transient (T)-type voltage-dependent calcium channels allow entry of calcium ions via a window current. T-type calcium channels activate at negative membrane potentials but also inactivate at similarly negative potentials (and deactivate very slowly). However, there is a small range of physiologically relevant membrane potentials at which there is a proportion of T-type channels that are activated but not yet deactivated or inactivated. In this range calcium current flows generating a “window current.” As shown, AngII shifts the voltage dependence of activation of T-type channels to more negative values to increase this window current, thus enhancing calcium entry and thereby stimulating aldosterone secretion.

channels, by shifting the voltage dependence of activation to more positive potentials (288). The reason for this disparity is unclear, although in the original report from Cohen et al. (78), it was noted that the effect of AngII on T-channel activity was transient and therefore may be difficult to detect consistently. On the other hand, subsequent data from Barrett’s laboratory suggest that in bovine glomerulosa cells AngII increases calcium influx through T-type calcium channels via two mechanisms, one involving a G protein (197) and the other CaMK-mediated phosphorylation (22, 68, 198, 345), suggesting the likelihood of a positive effect of AngII on calcium entry through T-type channels. The T-type channel expressed in the zona glomerulosa is the α1H encoded by Caᵥ3.2 [(297) and reviewed in (127)].

The other type of voltage-dependent calcium channel expressed by zona glomerulosa cells is the L-type channel. These channels inactivate very slowly but require more positive membrane potentials to activate and also deactivate rapidly, such that these channels are likely only active at depolarized membrane potentials (which could be caused by high extracellular potassium levels; see below). In the zona glomerulosa cell, these channels are encoded by Caᵥ1.2 (α1C) and Caᵥ1.3 (α1D) (127) and are inhibited by AngII through a pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein (205). In addition, although calcium influx through L-type channels seems to be translated efficiently into increases in cytosolic calcium concentration, calcium ions entering through these channels appear to be ineffective in stimulating aldosterone production [(16) and reviewed in (127)].

Aldosterone production is instead coupled to calcium entry through T-type channels [(18, 78, 196) and reviewed
in (127)], and in fact, it has been proposed that there is a direct coupling between T-type calcium channels, the mitochondrial matrix and aldosterone biosynthesis [reviewed in (315)]. There are multiple lines of evidence to support the importance of T-type calcium channels to aldosterone production in glomerulosa cells exposed to AngII, as well as to elevated extracellular potassium levels (see below). Thus, selective T-type channel blockers, such as mibefradil and benidipine, inhibit aldosterone production in response to stimulation with AngII or elevated extracellular potassium levels in multiple glomerulosa cell models (2, 196, 289). Consistent with a role for T-channels in aldosterone biosynthesis, nitrendipine, a selective L-type channel blocker at low doses (19), also reduces calcium current through T-type channels at higher concentrations (78), and only at these higher doses also inhibits aldosterone production (78, 171). In addition and as discussed below, the predicted steady-state (window) current at different extracellular potassium concentrations correlates nicely with the observed effect of these potassium levels on aldosterone production (78).

Calcium ions, either released from the ER storage pool by IP₃ or entering the cell through capacitative or voltage-dependent calcium channel mechanisms, can bind to calmodulin and activate this protein. The calcium/calmodulin complex can then stimulate the activity of CaMKs. As discussed above, these CaMKs play an important role in mediating steroidogenesis, as inhibition of these enzymes with CaMK inhibitors such as KN93 reduces AngII-elicited aldosterone production in multiple glomerulosa cell models as well as CYP11B2 expression in human adrenocortical carcinoma cell lines [for example, (80, 250)]. In various glomerulosa cell models both CaMKI and CaMKII appear to underlie aldosterone production in response to AngII (80, 198). In bovine zona glomerulosa cells AngII activates CaMKII (104), and this enzyme, in particular CaMKIIgamma(C) (338), phosphorylates T-type channels to shift their voltage dependence of activation to more negative potentials (197, 198, 338, 345), thus allowing greater calcium influx through a larger window of membrane potentials (see above and Fig. 8). CaMKI, on the other hand, appears to be the isoform responsible for the induction of CYP11B2 expression by AngII in H295R cells (80), thereby defining the aldosterone synthetic capacity of these cells.

(314)]. Upon stimulation with AngII, the zona glomerulosa membrane depolarizes (see below), and this depolarization is thought to allow the enhancement of calcium influx through voltage-dependent calcium channels to sustain aldosterone production [reviewed in (127)]. The relatively hyperpolarized membrane potential and high basal potassium permeability of zona glomerulosa cells (see below) also likely accounts for the exquisite sensitivity of these cells to small elevations in extracellular/serum potassium concentrations (discussed in the section on potassium signaling mechanisms).

Adrenal glomerulosa cells express a number of potassium channels that help to maintain their negative resting membrane potential as well as to allow depolarization of the plasma membrane upon stimulation with AngII or elevated extracellular potassium levels (see below). In addition, restoration of the hyperpolarized membrane potential is necessary to remove channel inactivation and allow continued activity of voltage-dependent calcium channels. By their ability to maintain membrane potential, several of these potassium channels have been shown to play key roles in regulating steroidogenesis both *in vitro* and *in vivo*. One such channel, or family of channels, is the TASK [TWIK (tandem of p domains in a weak inward rectifying K channel) related acid-sensitive K+ channels] group of potassium channels, which form “leak channels” [reviewed in (101)]. Glomerulosa cells appear to express several members of this family, TASK-1, TASK-3, and TREK-1, although, at least in rat zona glomerulosa cells, potassium current through TASK-3 predominates basally (83).

Mouse models have been generated that are engineered to lack either or both the TASK1 and the TASK3 potassium channel. TASK1 knockout mice exhibit hyperaldosteronism and hypertension that seem to be caused by abnormal adrenal cortex zonation and is remediable by glucocorticoids (136). These effects are independent of gender in young mice but are restricted to females in adult animals. In adult female but not male mice, CYP11B2 protein is expressed abnormally in cells of the zona fasciculata, an effect that appears to be mediated by androgens, as castrate males also exhibit abnormal CYP11B2 localization and testosterone treatment restores normal localization in females (136). On the other hand, the adult males show higher TASK3 expression, which could also possibly compensate for the lack of TASK1 in these animals (136). Whole-cell patch clamp analysis demonstrates that the glomerulosa cells from these TASK1 knockout mice show a slight depolarization of the resting membrane potential (136). Since small changes in membrane potential are known to activate T-type channels (78), this slight depolarization should result in greater calcium influx through T-channels, which should in turn increase aldosterone production (through effects on StAR activity and CYP11B2 expression as discussed above). However, this idea does not take into account the abnormal localization of CYP11B2 protein in the adrenal glands of adult female mice, a finding that suggests a potential role for TASK1 in the maintenance of adrenocortical zonation.

### Potassium channels and membrane potential

As voltage-dependent calcium channels play a key role in aldosterone production in response to AngII, mechanisms involved in establishing the zona glomerulosa cell membrane potential are also important in this process. Zona glomerulosa cells usually maintain a very negative membrane potential (127) close to the Nernst potential for potassium. This high resting membrane potential suggests that under basal conditions the glomerulosa plasma membrane is mostly permeant to potassium, and in fact, these cells exhibit a high basal potassium conductance [reviewed in
Regulation of Aldosterone Synthesis and Secretion

Deletion of TASK3, on the other hand, appears to recapitulate low-renin essential hypertension in adult TASK3 knockout mice (128, 248). Two independent mouse models have been developed and show similar, although not identical, characteristics. Thus, Penton et al. (248) describe that under basal conditions TASK3 knockout mice display essentially normal serum aldosterone levels and can respond to challenge with high potassium or low-sodium diets with the appropriate upregulation of aldosterone production. However, these animals demonstrate increased salt sensitivity, maintaining aldosterone levels on a high-sodium (or a low-potassium) diet at levels comparable to those seen on a normal salt diet, instead of suppressing production of this steroid hormone as is observed in wild-type mice (248). This salt sensitivity appears to result from autonomous aldosterone production, possibly resulting from the small membrane depolarization observed in the adrenocortical cells of these animals (240). On the other hand, Barrett and colleagues have reported increased urinary aldosterone levels with no change in zona glomerulosa cell membrane potential (128). These authors suggest that the phenotype is the result of increased sensitivity to AngII rather than to depolarization or elevated CYP11B2 expression (128). On the other hand, neonatal TASK3 knockout mice demonstrate a more severe hyperaldosteronism and hypertension (12). In this case, the adrenal cortical dysfunction results from upregulation of the tissue renin-angiotensin system and includes increased mRNA expression of renin in the adrenal, as well as renin-positive cells in the zona fasciculata (12).

The TASK1/TASK3 double knockout mouse model also exhibits an adrenal phenotype, demonstrating essentially autonomous aldosterone secretion reminiscent of idiopathic primary aldosteronism (91). Thus, these mice exhibit elevated urine aldosterone excretion despite normal or low renin levels and fail to suppress aldosterone production on a high salt diet or upon treatment with an AT1R blocker. Because the zona glomerulosa cells of the double knockout mouse exhibit depolarization (89), which should activate calcium influx through voltage-dependent calcium channels, it seems likely that the autonomous steroidogenesis observed is related to this change in membrane potential and the resultant calcium influx. Clearly, these three mouse models demonstrate the key role played by TASK channels in adrenal structure and function.

Another channel that has gained recent attention is the G protein-activated inward rectifier potassium channel 4 (GIRK4), also known as Kir3.4, encoded by the KCNJ5 gene. The importance of this gene product to adrenal physiology has been recently demonstrated by the finding that KCNJ5 is mutated in familial hyperaldosteronism type 3 in humans (119). The mutation identified occurs in the ion-selectivity filter, resulting in an ability of sodium ions to permeate this potassium channel (119). Sodium entry through the mutant channel then depolarizes the cell, presumably leading to calcium influx through voltage-dependent calcium channels to signal aldosterone production, as was observed in HAC15 cells *in vitro* upon overexpression of a threonine 158 to alanine KCNJ5 mutant (235). On the other hand, overexpression of the wild-type gene encoding this inwardly rectifying potassium channel in HAC15 cells inhibits AngII-induced calcium mobilization, CYP11B2 expression and aldosterone production; treatment with AngII decreases channel mRNA and protein expression (234). This result is consistent with the idea that the wild-type Kir3.4 channel helps to maintain a hyperpolarized membrane potential and inhibit calcium influx through voltage-dependent calcium channels. Since the initial report of the KCNJ5 mutation in familial hyperaldosteronism type 3, other investigators have found additional mutations in KCNJ5 associating with primary aldosteronism and/or aldosterone-producing adenomas [(73, 216) and reviewed in (120, 296, 349)], although in this case the majority of the mutations are represented by mutations of glycine 151 to arginine or glutamate or of lysine 168 to arginine (296).

Importantly, AngII inhibits the activity of many potassium channels, and it is known that the hormone induces membrane depolarization in glomerulosa cells [reviewed in (314)]. Using the patch clamp technique, it has been found that AngII decreases the open probability of a 12 pS potassium channel and reduces the macroscopic potassium current in an AT1R-dependent manner (195). The channel responsible was not identified in this particular report, but subsequently, other investigators have demonstrated an ability of AngII to inhibit the TREK-1 channel (100) and, in a heterologous system, TASK-1 channels (through a G protein and PLC) (84, 85). In addition, AngII also reduces the expression of KCNJ5 to decrease its activity (234). This inhibition by AngII of various potassium channels presumably reduces the potassium leak current, which then depolarizes the cell and allows activation of voltage-dependent calcium channels (see above).

### Phospholipase D

PLD catalyzes the hydrolysis of its substrate phosphatidylcholine to generate the lipid signal phosphatidic acid and the choline head group (Fig. 9). Phosphatidic acid can then be dephosphorylated to yield the second messenger diacylglycerol. PLD also has the unique characteristic of utilizing primary alcohols in place of water to catalyze the “alcoholysis” (transphosphatidylation) of phosphatidylcholine. Therefore, small amounts of primary alcohol can be used to divert product formation away from phosphatidic acid (and diacylglycerol) and to phosphatidylalcohols, which in general are not readily metabolized (40). In primary bovine adrenal glomerulosa cells, the primary alcohol, 1-butanol is able to inhibit AngII-induced aldosterone production, but has little or no effect on steroidogenesis in control cells or in response to the hydrophilic cholesterol analog 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol, which bypasses signaling pathways and stimulates aldosterone production directly (40). In addition, 1-butanol inhibits the increases in phosphatidic acid and diacylglycerol induced by AngII in these cells (40). These data indicate that PLD activity is necessary for maximal AngII-induced aldosterone secretion in bovine zona glomerulosa

Figure 9 Lipid second messengers involved in AngII-induced aldosterone production. (A) A schematic illustrating lipid second messengers generated as a result of AngII binding to the AT1R is shown. These include phosphatidic acid (PA), which is generated directly by the action of PLD on phosphatidylcholine or indirectly by phosphorylation of diacylglycerol (DAG) by diacylglycerol kinase, and DAG, generated by PLCβ-mediated hydrolysis of PIP₂. PA can also be metabolized to DAG by lipid phosphate phosphatases or can be deacylated by phospholipase A to generate lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and a free fatty acid such as arachidonic acid (AA). In addition, glomerulosa cells express a DAG lipase that preferentially releases AA from DAG; AA can also be released directly from phospholipids by the activity of phospholipase A₂. In turn, AA is metabolized by 12-lipoxygenase to 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12-HETE). (B) The structure of the different lipid molecules and second messengers is illustrated. The phosphatidylcholine shown contains stearic and arachidonic acids (and so generates phosphatidic acid and diacylglycerol containing these fatty acids).

cells. 1-Butanol has also been used to demonstrate the involvement of PLD signaling in AngII-induced aldosterone production in H295R human adrenocortical carcinoma cells. Thus, 1-butanol inhibits AngII- but not phorbol ester-induced aldosterone production in these cells (350). These results suggest that PLD mediates, at least in part, AngII-elicited aldosterone production in both bovine adrenal glomerulosa cells (40) and H295R cells (350). In addition, treatment of bovine glomerulosa cells with exogenous bacterial PLD increases diacylglycerol levels and aldosterone production, and this stimulatory

effect can be enhanced by a calcium channel agonist (36). This finding indicates that PLD activity is also sufficient to induce aldosterone secretion.

Two isoforms of PLD, PLD1, and PLD2, have been cloned, sequenced, and characterized [reviewed in (110, 246)]. Both isoenzymes utilize phosphatidylcholine as a substrate and require PIP₂ for their activity. In addition, the activity of PLD1 is regulated by ADP ribosylation factor (ARF) and the small GTP-binding protein, RhoA, as well as by PKCα [reviewed in (110, 246)]. PLD2, on the other hand, exhibits constitutive activity, at least when expressed in insect cells and assayed *in vitro* (79); however, in intact cells PLD2 is also apparently regulated by ARF and PKC (134, 193, 242, 271, 307). In addition to differential regulation, these two PLD isoforms are generally found in different subcellular locations, with PLD2 usually localizing to the plasma membrane and PLD1 locating in intracellular membranes and vesicular compartments [reviewed in (246)]. Both isoforms appear to be involved in vesicle trafficking processes [reviewed in (107, 191)]: for example, PLD2 regulates constitutive secretion in resting cells as well as the endocytosis of mu-opioid, epidermal growth factor and AT1 receptors (95, 163, 305), and PLD1 mediates phorbol ester-stimulated secretion and insulin-induced translocation of the glucose transporter, GLUT-4 (93, 99). PLD2 may also play a role in cytoskeletal rearrangements and motility [(79) and reviewed in (110)], and both isoforms are likely involved in cell proliferation and tumor development [reviewed in (107)].

In recent studies, the PLD inhibitor, fluoro-2-indolyl deschlorohalopemide (FIPI) (324), has also been shown to inhibit aldosterone secretion induced by AngII in primary cultures of bovine adrenal glomerulosa cells and in the HAC15 human adrenocortical carcinoma cell line (237). FIPI is known to inhibit both known isoforms of PLD, PLD1 and PLD2 (324), and 1-butanol is similarly not selective at inhibiting lipid signal generation by a particular PLD isoform. However, in primary cultures of bovine zona glomerulosa cells, overexpression of PLD2, but not PLD1 or lipase-dead mutant PLD2, enhances the aldosterone secretory response to AngII (257), again suggesting the importance of PLD to steroidogenesis and indicating that the isoform involved is PLD2. Whether PLD acts to stimulate aldosterone production through its direct product phosphatidic acid, or its indirect product diacylglycerol (formed by the action of lipid phosphate phosphatase on phosphatidic acid) is, however, unclear. Phosphatidic acid is known to recruit Raf-1, a member of the MAPK signaling pathway upstream to ERK-1/2, to the plasma membrane for activation by Ras (271, 272) and could therefore potentially underlie aldosterone production through effects on ERK (see below). Other effectors for phosphatidic acid have also been identified, as discussed subsequently in the section on potassium signaling pathways and illustrated in Figure 10. Diacylglycerol, on the other hand, can activate PKC and PKD, as well as other effectors, as discussed above.

Figure 10 Potential effectors of the lipid second messengers, phosphatidic acid (PA), and diacylglycerol (DAG). PA can interact with and modulate the activity of a variety of effector enzymes as shown. These include the PIP₂-synthesizing enzyme phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase (PI4P5K), c-Raf (a mitogen-activated kinase kinase kinase upstream of extracellular signal-regulated kinase), the cAMP-hydrolyzing enzyme cAMP phosphodiesterase type D (PDE4D3), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) protein kinase, the small GTPase Rac, protein serine/threonine phosphatase 1 (PP1), the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1, the protein kinase kinase suppressor of ras (KSR), the orphan nuclear receptor steroidogenic factor-1 (SF1), PKCα, a Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) son of sevenless (SOS), the heterotrimeric G protein subunit Gₒα, the potassium channel KcsA, and the protein kinase ribosomal p70 S6 kinase (S6 kinase). Myosin phosphatase and brefeldin A ADP-ribosylated substrate (not shown) are also reported PA effectors. DAG effectors include the classical and novel PKC isoenzymes, PKD, the Ras GEF Ras guanine nucleotide release protein (RasGRP), the Rac GTPase-activating proteins chimaerins and the UNC13 proteins, which are involved in vesicle maturation and exocytosis.

### Mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling

AngII also activates MAPK signaling, such as the MAPK pathway culminating in ERK-1/2. In bovine adrenal glomerulosa cells ERK-1/2 has been shown to phosphorylate and activate cholesterol ester hydrolase (71), the enzyme responsible for cleaving cholesteryl esters to yield free cholesterol. Thus, AngII-induced ERK-1/2 may support aldosterone production by ensuring an adequate supply of the cholesterol precursor. Nevertheless, the role of ERK-1/2 in aldosterone synthesis has been somewhat controversial, as some investigators have reported an ability of inhibitors of the ERK-1/2 signaling to reduce AngII-elicted steroidogenesis in bovine and human adrenocarcinoma glomerulosa cell models (62, 71, 147) and others have not (in rat and human models) (209, 228). However, recent evidence indicates that ERK-1/2 can phosphorylate StAR at serine 232 (in a cholesterol-dependent manner) to activate its cholesterol-transporting activity [reviewed in (202, 253)], suggesting the likelihood that ERK-1/2 is a positive mediator of aldosterone production. Furthermore, there is additional evidence pointing to a role for the MAPK ERK pathway in AngII-induced aldosterone production: in bovine zona glomerulosa cells AngII induces the expression/activity of mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase-1 (MKP-1), the enzyme responsible for dephosphorylating, among other
substrates, ERK-1/2 (62). Expression is induced in an ERK-1/2-dependent manner and can be inhibited by ERK-1/2 pathway inhibitors. These inhibitors also reduce aldosterone production, as does overexpression of MKP-1 (62). Together these results suggest that $MKP-1$ expression is regulated to serve as a negative feedback loop. On the other hand, AngII can also stimulate glomerulosa cells to grow (i.e., hypertrophy) or proliferate [reviewed in (108, 240)] in addition to inducing aldosterone biosynthesis, and ERK-1/2 appears to mediate this mitogenic response to AngII as well (310, 325).

Another MAPK pathway activated by AngII in zona glomerulosa cells is p38 (126, 176, 317). Spät and others [(176, 317) and reviewed in (313)] have accumulated evidence to suggest that p38 regulates intracellular calcium stores and by so doing modulates aldosterone production in bovine zona glomerulosa cells. 12-HETE is also reported to activate p38, and a p38 inhibitor blunts the increased aldosterone production observed in H295R cells engineered to overexpress 12-lipoxygenase (126). Thus, the p38 MAPK pathway also appears to play an important role in regulating aldosterone production in response to AngII and its downstream signals.

### Tyrosine kinases

Data in the literature also suggest the importance of tyrosine kinases in the AngII-induced steroidogenic response. Thus, several laboratories have shown that inhibition of tyrosine kinases with various inhibitors reduces AngII-elicted aldosterone production in multiple glomerulosa cell models (33, 157, 238, 309). One such family of tyrosine kinases with likely relevance to steroidogenesis in the zona glomerulosa is the Src family. AngII has been shown to activate Src in H295R cells (309) and a Src family kinase inhibitor, PP2, reduces AngII-induced aldosterone production. In these cells this effect of PP2 appears to result from an ability of the inhibitor to promote characteristics of the zona reticularis at the expense of a zona glomerulosa/zona fasciculata phenotype (309). In primary cultures of bovine zona glomerulosa cells PP2 inhibits AngII-elicted PKD activation to decrease aldosterone biosynthesis (238). In addition, in H295R cells Src inhibition decreases the AngII-induced increase in the mRNA levels of NGFI-B family members, which are known to regulate the expression of key steroidogenic genes like $CYP11B2$ [(231) and see below].

Another tyrosine kinase with an apparent role in mediating aldosterone secretion in response to AngII is Janus-activated kinase-2 (JAK2), a tyrosine kinase upstream of the signal transducer and activator of transcription (Stat) family of transcription factors. In H295R cells AngII activates JAK2, and inhibition of this activity with a JAK2 inhibitor reduces AngII-induced StAR promoter activity and steroid production (190). It should be noted that in vascular smooth muscle cells AngII acts through tyrosine kinases including Src, Jak, and focal adhesion kinase [reviewed in (326)]. Thus, it is perhaps not surprising that similar mechanisms may operate in zona glomerulosa cells of the adrenal gland.

Additional AngII signal transduction pathways that operate in other cell types, such as vascular smooth muscle cells [reviewed in (326)], may also be involved in AngII's effects in zona glomerulosa cells, although few studies have been conducted to date into these mechanisms in glomerulosa cells. One such signaling mechanism activated by AngII in vascular smooth muscle cells is PLC$\gamma$. PLC$\gamma$ is regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation, rather than by a G protein as is PLC$\beta$, but results in the generation of the same two second messengers, IP$_{3}$ and diacylglycerol. In other systems AngII has also been reported to transactivate the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR) by inducing the cleavage of EGFR ligands such as transforming growth factor-$\alpha$ (TGF$\alpha$) and heparin-binding EGF (HB-EGF), which then bind to and activate the intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity of the EGFR [reviewed in (326)]. Such transactivation results in the stimulation of multiple tyrosine kinase receptor-mediated signaling events including PLC$\gamma$ and MAPK pathways. Whether these systems are activated by AngII in zona glomerulosa cells is unclear, although EGF has been shown to increase aldosterone production (160) and/or to enhance AngII-induced steroidogenesis (225). In addition, the ability of endothelin-1 and lysophosphatidic acid to stimulate aldosterone biosynthesis has been shown to depend upon EGFR transactivation (299, 300).

#### Downstream transcription factors mediating aldosterone production

The signaling pathways activated in glomerulosa cells by AngII binding to the AT1R exert some of their effects by inducing the expression of and/or activating transcription factors that then alter gene expression. The regulation of $CYP11B2$ expression in particular has been extensively investigated. The promoter for this gene possesses some critical response elements that bind transcription factors to modulate transcription (Fig. 11). For example, the human $CYP11B2$ promoter possesses three potential cAMP response elements (CRE) recognized by members of the activating transcription factor (ATF)/CREB family of transcription factors (77). The proximal CRE element appears to be necessary for the regulation of $CYP11B2$ in response to AngII, elevated extracellular potassium levels and cAMP (77), and electrophoretic mobility shift/supershift assays using nuclear extracts of glomerulosa cells indicates binding of CREB family members to this element. In addition, deletion or mutation of the CRE to which these transcription factors bind inhibits $CYP11B2$ promoter activity stimulated by AngII (77, 80), as well as constitutively active CaMKI (80). However, this element is not sufficient to stimulate $CYP11B2$ expression as a promoter truncated to include just this CRE is not activated by aldosterone agonists (77). Other transcription factors, such as nuclear receptor related 1 protein (Nurr1 or NR4A2) and nerve growth factor-induced clone B (NGFIB or NR4A1, also known as Nur77) (23), also bind to the CRE in the $CYP11B2$ promoter and induce expression of this gene.

Figure 11 Transcription factors regulating CYP11B2 expression in glomerulosa cells. The CYP11B2 promoter possesses several response elements that are bound by transcription factors that regulate the expression of this gene. Transcription factors responsible for controlling CYP11B2 expression include, as illustrated, members of the ATF/CREB family of transcription factors and members of the nerve growth factor-induced clone B (NGFIB) transcription factor family, such as NGFIB (also known as NR4A1 or Nur77) and nuclear receptor related-1 protein (Nurr1, also known as NR4A2). Steroidogenic factor-1 (SF1) appears to exert a biphasic effect on CYP11B2 expression, with transcription decreased both at low and high levels of SF1.

(DAX1) appears to repress STAR transcription, and AngII has been shown to decrease DAX1 expression and levels in bovine adrenal glomerulosa cells (239). However, similarly to SF1, DAX1 is clearly important in adrenal development, as patients with mutations in this gene exhibit adrenal hypoplasia [reviewed in (340)].

Still another transcription factor involved in regulating steroidogenesis through effects on STAR expression is c-Fos, a member of the AP-1 family of transcription factors that also includes c-Jun. AngII induces the expression of c-Fos in bovine adrenal glomerulosa cells and increases c-Fos protein levels and phosphorylation in an ERK-dependent manner (270). Electromobility shift and supershift assays indicate that both c-Fos and c-Jun bind to the STAR promoter, and AngII increases c-Fos binding to the StAR promoter as shown by chromatin immunoprecipitation (270). Interference with the transcriptional activity of c-Fos by overexpression of a dominant-negative Fos mutant inhibits AngII-induced StAR protein and mRNA expression and aldosterone production (270). Thus, c-Fos and the AP-1 transcription factor also play an important role in regulating STAR expression and steroidogenesis in response to AngII.

Temporal integration of signaling through AT1R to promote aldosterone production

By activating phosphoinositide hydrolysis upon binding to the AT1R, AngII induces a two-pronged signaling pathway. Thus, IP3 released upon PIP2 cleavage induces calcium release from ER stores to increase cytosolic calcium levels and activate CaMKs, whereas the diacylglycerol generated by this reaction activates other signaling pathways such as PKC and PKD. It has been proposed that the calcium branch of the pathway initiates aldosterone production in response to AngII, whereas the combination of diacylglycerol and increased calcium influx sustains the aldosterone secretory response [reviewed in (15, 267)]. This idea is based on a number of different lines of evidence. For example, inhibiting calcium influx has little effect on the initial aldosterone secretory response to AngII but prevents sustained steroidogenesis [(171) and see Fig. 7]. In addition, mimicking the IP3-induced transient increase in cytosolic calcium using the calcium ionophore A23187 or the calcium channel agonist BAYK 8644 stimulates aldosterone production but only transiently. On the other hand, exposing cells to agents that substitute for the diacylglycerol generated by PIP2 hydrolysis, such as synthetic diacylglycerol, enzymes that generate diacylglycerol or phorbol esters like PMA, elicits a slowly developing gradual rise in aldosterone biosynthesis (36, 165, 171, 173). {Nevertheless, it should be noted that not all laboratories have demonstrated an ability of these diacylglycerol mimetics to induce aldosterone production [e.g., (6, 129) and reviewed in (314)]; see above.} However, when cells are exposed to both calcium-elevating and diacylglycerol-mimicking or -elevating agents in combination, a monotonic aldosterone secretory response similar to that produced by AngII is observed (Fig. 12)

Figure 12 AngII-induced aldosterone secretion can be mimicked by agents reproducing the calcium and diacylglycerol signals. As schematically illustrated, the importance of both branches of the AngII-induced signaling pathways resulting from the hydrolysis of PIP₂ is demonstrated by the requirement for two signals to mimic the aldosterone secretory response to this hormone. Thus, an agent that increases cytosolic calcium levels, such as the calcium ionophore A23187, induces only a transient increase in aldosterone secretion. Conversely, an agent that substitutes for DAG in activating its effectors, such as phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), elicits a slowly developing rise in aldosterone secretion. On the other hand, the combination of these two agents produces a monotonic increase in aldosterone secretion that resembles the response to AngII. Similarly, increasing calcium influx with the calcium channel agonist BAY K8644 has a minimal effect on aldosterone secretion unless it is added together with synthetic DAGs such as 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol (OAG), or DAG-generating bacterial PLD, to mimic the DAG/PKC signal. In this case the combination induces a monotonic increase in aldosterone production.

(36, 165, 171, 173). This combination also largely reproduces the protein phosphorylation pattern seen with AngII stimulation of glomerulosa cells (21). These results imply that both second messengers generated by PLCβ-mediated hydrolysis of PIP₂ play important roles in producing aldosterone in response to AngII.

AngII-induced priming

In addition to the various signaling pathways discussed above, AngII also has the capacity to elicit priming. Priming refers to a type of cellular memory in which pretreatment with AngII sensitizes bovine adrenal glomerulosa cells to respond to agents that increase calcium influx with a greater aldosterone secretory response. This subsequent treatment with a calcium influx-enhancer must be within a certain window of time (20, 41) and can be a second AngII exposure (20), the calcium channel agonist BAY K8644 (20, 38) or an elevated extracellular potassium concentration (30) (Fig. 13). For instance, BAY K8644, which is ineffective in naive untreated cells, is able to induce aldosterone secretion from cells that have been pretreated with AngII (20, 38). Priming occurs despite the fact that the second stimulus elicits a smaller (transient) increase in cytosolic calcium concentration (AngII) (174) or the same change in inositol phosphates production and calcium influx (BAY K8644) (20). Thus, priming in these cells cannot be accounted for by a greater calcium signal. Instead,

Figure 13 AngII can prime adrenal glomerulosa cells to respond to a second AngII exposure to an agent that increases calcium influx with enhanced aldosterone secretion. (A) The ability of AngII to prime zona glomerulosa cells to a second AngII exposure is schematically illustrated. With the priming response, pretreatment of glomerulosa cells with AngII induces an aldosterone secretory response that returns to basal upon removal of AngII (or addition of an AngII receptor antagonist). If the cells are reexposed to AngII within a certain time frame, the second aldosterone secretory response is enhanced relative to the first (or relative to cells that are not pretreated). It should be noted that the window of time differs between freshly isolated cells in a perfusion system (15–20 min) or cultured cells subjected to frequent medium changes (30–50 min). (B) AngII pretreatment can also prime glomerulosa cells to respond to agents that increase calcium influx with enhanced aldosterone secretion, relative to cells that have not been pretreated with AngII. Thus, whereas in naive (unpretreated) cells, the calcium channel agonist BAY K8644 or a slightly elevated extracellular potassium level induces only a minimal aldosterone secretory response, these agents induce substantial aldosterone secretion in AngII-pretreated cells. Since sustained aldosterone secretion requires two signals, calcium influx and a DAG messenger, the capacity of AngII to induce priming to agents that increase calcium influx suggests that a DAG signal is maintained following AngII removal (or addition of an AngII receptor antagonist) to underlie priming.

it has been proposed that the priming effect of AngII is related to the induction of a persistent association of PKC with the plasma membrane upon stimulation of diacylglycerol formation [reviewed in (266)]. At this location PKC would be able to “read” the enhanced calcium influx elicited by BAY K8644 or other calcium influx-enhancing agents and thus activate secretion [(20) and reviewed in (15)]. Indeed, the rate of calcium entry has been shown to regulate PKC activity in bovine glomerulosa cells (164).

Because physiologically, PKC association with the membrane is promoted by diacylglycerol, the finding that diacylglycerol remains elevated for up to 45 min following AngII removal (38) supports the idea of a possible persistent association of PKC with the membrane. Additional evidence for this idea is provided by the demonstration of a maintained increase in diacylglycerol content following removal of AngII (38) and a rapid calcium-dependent PKC activation with a second exposure to AngII (164). This persistent diacylglycerol appears to be derived from phosphatidylcholine, rather than phosphoinositide hydrolysis (38). Since PLD hydrolyzes predominantly phosphatidylcholine (133), this result would suggest a role for PLD in the persistent increase in diacylglycerol content following AngII removal. In contrast to AngII, on the other hand, the acetylcholine analog carbachol, which also activates phosphoinositide hydrolysis in glomerulosa cells [(172) and see below], is unable to induce a persistent increase in diacylglycerol content following its removal (37). Again in contrast to AngII, carbachol elicits only a transient increase in PLD activity (154) and is unable to induce priming (37). Thus, based on these data, we have proposed that sustained PLD activity mediates the persistent increase in phosphatidylcholine-derived diacylglycerol and resultant priming response following AngII removal (38) (Fig. 14).

Additional support for a role of PLD in the development of AngII-induced priming is provided by the finding that phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate activates PLD in a sustained manner and is able both to induce priming and to trigger a persistent elevation in myristate-containing diacylglycerol (41). Furthermore, the persistent diacylglycerol is not the result of continued PLD activation, since PLD activity returns to control values within 30 min of AngII removal (41). Based on results showing that myristate-containing diacylglycerol is slowly metabolized and myristate is preferentially incorporated into phosphatidylcholine (38), it appears instead that the metabolism of this phosphatidylcholine-derived diacylglycerol is delayed, providing a “sustained release” form of the lipid second messenger. Indeed, reducing AngII-elicited PLD signal generation with 1-butanol inhibits the generation of priming (41). The PLD isoform involved in this response is at present unknown, but the ability of overexpression of PLD2 to enhance the AngII-induced aldosterone secretory response (257) suggests the likelihood that PLD2 underlies priming.

The physiological significance of AngII-induced priming is at present unknown. However, there is some evidence to suggest that this mechanism could potentially allow enhanced secretory responses to aldosterone agonists with

AngII changes *in vivo*. Alterations in tissue production of AngII and local AngII concentrations have been proposed to contribute to the altered adrenal responsiveness to this hormone in some forms of hypertension [reviewed in (337)]. It seems possible that pulses of AngII, produced either locally or systemically, could generate priming and enhance aldosterone secretion, which under conditions of salt-restriction would be beneficial, since the multiple AngII pulse-induced priming would result in enhanced aldosterone secretion and salt retention. In contrast, if priming developed inappropriately, for example, during high salt intake [reviewed in (337)], or if the enhancement of aldosterone secretion with priming were excessive, priming might be disadvantageous and could contribute to some forms of hypertension. In this regard, it has been demonstrated that vascular smooth muscle cells from spontaneously hypertensive rats exhibit greater agonist-induced PLD activity than those derived from normotensive control rats (4, 177). If enhanced AngII-induced PLD activity also occurs in zona glomerulosa cells in hypertensive individuals, enhanced priming could provide a potential link between PLD, increased aldosterone levels and hypertension. AngII-generated priming mechanisms may also be important in the regulation of mitogenesis, as PLD has been shown to play a role in proliferation in other cell types [reviewed in (107)]. Thus, an enhanced mitogenic response to AngII after the induction of priming could also contribute to increased aldosterone secretion and hypertension by a hyperplastic mechanism.

### AngII-induced signal transduction mechanisms through the AngII receptor, type 2 (AT2R)

Most, if not all, of the classical AngII actions on cardiovascular tissues including the adrenal zona glomerulosa involve the AT1R. These AT1R-mediated effects include stimulation of signal transduction pathways, such as phosphoinositide hydrolysis and activation of MAPK, PKD and PLD, steroidogenesis, mitogenesis and hypertrophy [reviewed in (114, 326, 336)]. Thus, most of the effects of AngII in these cells are inhibited by AT1R blockers such as losartan or candesartan, whereas an inhibitor of the AngII receptor, type 2 (AT2R), PD123319, has no influence on these processes [for example, (154, 304)]. However, PD123319 inhibits the effects of AngII on the secretion of endogenous ouabain (301, 302), suggesting the involvement of AT2R in this response. Another laboratory has reported that angiotensin III, a hexapeptide generated by cleavage of AngII at the N terminus, stimulates aldosterone production in rat adrenal glomerulosa cells through the AT2R, in part, with no involvement of the AT1R (346). Nevertheless, in general, stimulation of the AT2R appears to antagonize the effects of the AT1R in most tissues [reviewed in (114, 326)]. Nevertheless, the signal transduction mechanisms involved are relatively unexplored but may involve stimulation of protein phosphatase activity and activation of the G<sub>i</sub> heterotrimeric G protein [reviewed in (139)].

Figure 14 Proposed mechanism of Angll-induced priming. Under control conditions, the AT1R is unoccupied and signal transduction pathways are minimally activated. (A) Angll binding to its AT1R triggers the production of two pools of DAG, a slowly metabolized pool marked by myristate and a rapidly metabolized pool incorporating arachidonate. Because myristate is primarily incorporated into phosphatidylcholine, the substrate of PLD, and Angll activates PLD, the slowly metabolized pool of DAG is likely generated by PLD activity. The combination of the DAG signal and a calcium influx signal stimulates aldosterone secretion. (B) Upon removal of Angll (or antagonism of its receptor), calcium influx rapidly declines as does the arachidonate-containing DAG, whereas the myristate-DAG remains elevated, presumably retaining PKC at the plasma membrane. However, in the absence of calcium influx, PKC is inactive or insufficient by itself to induce aldosterone production. (C) Upon re-exposure to Angll, additional PKC is recruited to the plasma membrane by the small release of ER calcium ions and the extra DAG generated. In addition, calcium influx is reactivated and stimulates PKC activity (or combines with the active PKC) to trigger aldosterone secretion, such that the second Angll exposure induces an enhanced secretory response relative to the first or to cells that are not pretreated with Angll. The PKC maintained at the plasma membrane by the slowly metabolized myristate-containing DAG following Angll pretreatment also allows the primed cells to respond to agents that activate calcium influx with enhanced aldosterone secretion, relative to those that are naïve (i.e., have had no prior Angll exposure).

Regulation of Aldosterone Synthesis and Secretion

### Summary of AngII signaling

Initiation of aldosterone production from precursor cholesterol in response to stimulation with AngII (as well as other aldosterone agonists) requires two major steps: the first, cholesterol mobilization from lipid droplets to the mitochondria followed by the second, the translocation of the cholesterol from the outer to the inner mitochondrial membrane, an action dependent upon active StAR protein. Both of these processes are induced as a result of the binding of AngII to its GPCR AT1R in the plasma membrane (with AT2R generally antagonizing the effects of stimulation of the AT1R.) The AngII/AT1R complex activates, through the GTP-binding protein Gq/11, a phosphoinositide-specific PLCβ, which hydrolyzes the membrane phospholipid, PIP₂ to generate IP₃ and diacylglycerol. IP₃ releases calcium from an intracellular ER store to raise the cytosolic calcium concentration and activate CaMK, the activity of which underlies acute and chronic aldosterone secretion through effects on the expression of STAR and CYP11B2, respectively. Diacylglycerol activates PKC, PKD, and other diacylglycerol effector enzymes, including PLD, the activity of which produces the lipid messengers, phosphatidic acid and diacylglycerol. AngII also increases calcium influx, in part through SOC channels and in part through voltage-dependent T-type calcium channels (stimulated by CaMKII-mediated phosphorylation and membrane depolarization), to maintain PKC and PLD activity and aldosterone secretion. Other signaling pathways activated by AngII include the MAPKs ERK-1/2 and p38 as well as tyrosine kinases. Many of these pathways exert their effects through modulating the levels or phosphorylation/activation of multiple transcription factors that regulate the expression of the early and late rate-limiting steps in aldosterone biosynthesis, STAR and CYP11B2, respectively. These pathways cooperate to induce sustained aldosterone production in response to AngII.

### Elevated Extracellular Potassium Concentration-Induced Signal Transduction Mechanisms

Conservation of serum potassium levels within a narrow range is critical to preserve proper polarization of nerve and muscle cells. Aldosterone helps to maintain potassium concentrations in the blood within this narrow range by enhancing potassium excretion in the urine as sodium is retained. The sensitivity of aldosterone-producing glomerulosa cells to serum potassium levels thus reflects aldosterone’s key role in regulating potassium excretion. Elevated extracellular potassium levels then activate various signaling pathways by depolarizing the glomerulosa cell to stimulate voltage-dependent calcium channel activity (Fig. 15).

### Potassium channels and membrane potential

Glomerulosa cells respond to small changes in serum potassium levels with enhanced aldosterone production [reviewed in (336)], with a rise of 1 mmol/L in serum potassium concentration essentially doubling aldosterone secretion [reviewed in (312)]. Adrenal glomerulosa cells typically exhibit a very negative membrane potential, close to the Nernst potential for potassium, suggesting that under basal conditions the membrane potential is determined mainly by potassium conductance [reviewed in (314)], as discussed above. Thus, small increases in potassium act to depolarize the cell by reducing the reversal potential for potassium. In other words, because the potassium leak current, carried by channels such as the family of two pore-forming potassium channels including TASK and TREK (see above), sets the resting membrane potential, the decreased electrochemical driving force for potassium caused by elevations in extracellular potassium concentration depolarizes the cell. This small membrane depolarization then activates voltage-dependent calcium channels, and the resulting enhancement in calcium influx mediates the effects of potassium on aldosterone biosynthesis.

### Voltage-dependent calcium channels

Presumably the voltage-dependent calcium channel involved in responding to the small changes in membrane potential caused by slight elevations in serum potassium levels is the T-type calcium channel, as its voltage dependence of activation predicts its activity at the relatively hyperpolarized membrane potential of glomerulosa cells at physiological potassium concentrations. Indeed, the predicted current through T-type channels has been found to correlate well with the observed changes in aldosterone production over a range of extracellular potassium values (18,78). In addition, inhibition of calcium influx through these channels inhibits potassium-induced aldosterone production [reviewed in (135, 314)]. At higher (nonphysiological) potassium concentrations, calcium influx through L-type channels appears to come into play and potently increases cytosolic calcium levels, but these changes in calcium do not seem to be efficiently coupled to steroidogenesis [(18) and reviewed in (127)].

### Calcium-sensitive signaling pathways activated by elevated extracellular potassium concentration

Elevated potassium-induced calcium influx through T-type channels increases cytosolic calcium concentrations and activates multiple signaling pathways involving calmodulin and CaMK. The importance of these two proteins has been demonstrated mostly through the use of inhibitors. Thus, both calmodulin inhibitors and CaMK inhibitors reduce the aldosterone production and/or CYP11B2 expression induced by elevated potassium levels in multiple glomerulosa cell models (80, 116, 250). It should be noted that one such CaMK inhibitor, KN62 has been shown to inhibit steroidogenesis independent of its effects on CaMK (76), so experiments with this particular inhibitor should be interpreted with caution. Nevertheless, the data support an important role for

Figure 15 Elevated extracellular potassium signaling mediating aldosterone secretion from adrenal glomerulosa cells. Elevated extracellular potassium levels depolarize the glomerulosa cell membrane potential (V<sub>m</sub>) by decreasing the electrochemical gradient for potassium efflux through the basal potassium conductance. The small change in membrane polarization activates T-type calcium channels to increase calcium influx and activate calcium signaling pathways including CaMKs. Elevated potassium levels may also increase cAMP levels by stimulating the activity of a calcium-sensitive adenylate cyclase (AC), although this effect is somewhat controversial. The increased cAMP levels would then stimulate the activity of cAMP-dependent protein kinase, or protein kinase A (PKA). Also controversial is whether or not elevated extracellular potassium levels increase phosphoinositide hydrolysis in glomerulosa cells (not shown). An increase in extracellular potassium concentration has also been reported to activate PLD and increase the phosphorylation of myristoylated alanine-rich C-kinase substrate (MARCKS), an endogenous PKC substrate, presumably by stimulating PKC activity. The activated CaMK, and possibly PKA, phosphorylates ATF/CREB transcription factors to induce StAR and CYP11B2 expression, the early and late rate-limiting steps in aldosterone biosynthesis, thereby stimulating aldosterone secretion.

calmodulin and CaMK in elevated extracellular potassium concentration-induced aldosterone biosynthesis.

Clearly, additional studies are necessary to resolve this issue.

Another pathway thought to be activated by potassium-induced changes in cytosolic calcium concentration is the cAMP/PKA signaling system. Nevertheless, whether or not elevated potassium levels trigger cAMP production remains somewhat controversial. Thus, some laboratories have reported increased cellular cAMP levels upon stimulation with elevated extracellular potassium concentrations [(168) and reviewed in (312)], whereas other laboratories have failed to observe such an increase (112, 116). Presumably expression of a calcium-sensitive adenylate cyclase could render glomerulosa cells sensitive to elevated potassium-elicted cAMP generation. Indeed, zona glomerulosa cells in the adrenal gland *in situ* have been shown by immunohistochemistry to express adenylate cyclase-1 and -3 (81), isoforms demonstrating calcium sensitivity [reviewed in (132)]. Therefore, it seems likely that elevated extracellular potassium concentrations could activate adenylate cyclase by increasing intracellular calcium levels, thereby resulting in increased cAMP levels, although the changes in cAMP might be relatively small and/or localized and thus difficult to detect.

Another signal transduction pathway that may or may not be activated by elevated extracellular potassium concentrations is phosphoinositide hydrolysis with resulting increased levels of inositol phosphates and activation of the diacylglycerol/PKC signaling. For instance, in bovine adrenal glomerulosa cells a small but significant decrease in PIP<sub>2</sub> levels was observed upon stimulation with an increased potassium level (168), and in rat adrenal capsular preparations (i.e., glomerulosa enriched) elevated potassium increases absolute levels of PIP<sub>2</sub> (and other phosphoinositides) and phosphatidic acid, similarly to the effects of AngII (103). Consistent with these results, in rat glomerulosa cells an elevated potassium concentration was found to stimulate radiolabeled inositol phosphate levels (129); similarly, potassium increased IP<sub>3</sub> levels measured using a microspectrophotometric method to determine absolute mass (327). In addition, a possible effect of an increased extracellular potassium concentration on the activity of PKC in rat glomerulosa cells is suggested by indirect evidence using a nonspecific inhibitor of PKC (staurosporine) (129). On the other hand, other investigators have provided

Regulation of Aldosterone Synthesis and Secretion

evidence against a role for phosphoinositide hydrolysis and the diacylglycerol/PKC branch in mediating stimulation of aldosterone secretion in response to elevated extracellular potassium levels. Thus, some have found no evidence of PIP₂ hydrolysis (116) or detected no increase in inositol phosphates (29, 168) in bovine zona glomerulosa cells, despite the observed decrease in PIP₂ levels (168). In addition, PKC activity does not translocate to the plasma membrane in response to elevated potassium stimulation of bovine cells (but translocation is observed with AngII) (185). Finally, and consistent with an inability to stimulate phosphoinositide hydrolysis, elevated potassium levels are not known to increase diacylglycerol levels in bovine glomerulosa cells (29, 143). Clearly, additional studies are needed to resolve the question of whether elevated potassium levels stimulate phosphoinositide hydrolysis. Nevertheless, in bovine adrenal glomerulosa cells an increased extracellular potassium concentration has been found to induce the phosphorylation of MARCKS (29), an endogenous substrate the phosphorylation of which is thought to be a marker for PKC activation in intact cells [reviewed in (10)]. This result suggests that potassium may activate PKC through an as yet unclear mechanism.

A potential explanation for the enhanced MARCKS phosphorylation (and presumably the PKC activation underlying this event) may be provided by the ability of an elevated potassium level to activate PLD (29). This PLD activation is not accompanied by a measurable increase in diacylglycerol or inositol phosphates generation (29), but PLD produces phosphatidic acid, which has been found in other systems to activate PKCα (348), as well as other effectors, including c-Raf, phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase (PI4P5K), cAMP phosphodiesterase, type D (PDE4D3), the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1, the serine/threonine protein phosphatase PP1, mammalian target of rapamycin, myosin phosphatase, the α subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein G₀, the small GTP binding protein Rac, brefeldin A ADP-ribosylated substrate, the potassium channel KcsA, ribosomal p70 S6 kinase, the Ras GEF son of sevenless (SOS) and the kinase suppressor of Ras [Fig. 9 and reviewed in (181, 260)]. Phosphatidic acid also binds to and regulates the transcriptional activity of steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1), although the phosphatidic acid is reported to arise indirectly from diacylglycerol-mediated phosphorylation of diacylglycerol rather than directly from PLD activity (and the gene affected is CYP17, encoding an enzyme not involved in aldosterone biosynthesis) (189). On the other hand, the exact mechanism by which PLD is activated in response to an elevated potassium concentration is unknown, although inhibition of calcium influx using a calcium channel antagonist prevents this stimulation of PLD activity (258).

**Interaction between AngII and elevated extracellular potassium concentrations to modulate aldosterone production**

There is a key interaction between extracellular potassium levels and AngII in regulating aldosterone secretion. Thus,

at extremely low potassium levels (2 mmol/L), AngII is less effective at stimulating sustained aldosterone production (68, 171). The low potassium level presumably hyperpolarizes the glomerulosa cell to such an extent that AngII is no longer able to sufficiently depolarize the plasma membrane to induce calcium influx and stimulate steroidogenesis. The ability of low potassium to inhibit AngII-induced aldosterone production is a logical extension of the fact that aldosterone could potentially reduce potassium even further through its effects to increase potassium excretion and therefore could potentially result in fatally low serum potassium levels in the absence of this fail-safe mechanism. Conversely, higher potassium levels enhance AngII’s induction of aldosterone biosynthesis, and increased potassium levels enhance the potency of AngII (68). Again, due to aldosterone’s role in promoting potassium excretion, this interaction between the two aldosterone secretagogues seems rational.

**Summary of potassium signaling**

To summarize, small increases in serum potassium levels stimulate calcium influx, via depolarization of the plasma membrane and activation of voltage-dependent calcium channels, and this influx increases cytoplasmic calcium levels and activates CaMK (reviewed in [37]). As with AngII, this influx is required for elevated extracellular potassium-induced aldosterone production, since inhibition of calcium influx abolishes the elevated potassium-stimulated steroidogenic response [(59, 175, 196, 289) and reviewed in (135, 314)]. However, contrary to AngII, increased extracellular potassium levels may also stimulate adenylate cyclase activity, thereby elevating cAMP levels [44] and presumably activating PKA. Increased potassium levels may also stimulate phosphoinositide hydrolysis, although this idea remains controversial. An elevation in the extracellular potassium concentration also activates PLD and triggers MARCKS phosphorylation (29). By regulating the glomerulosa cell’s membrane potential, extracellular potassium concentration can also modulate the response to AngII, with low potassium concentrations inhibiting AngII-induced aldosterone secretion and high potassium levels enhancing this response.

**ACTH-Induced Signal Transduction Mechanisms**

ACTH binds to its receptor, the melanocortin receptor (MC2R) resulting in the activation of the stimulatory G protein, Gₛ. The alpha subunit of this heterotrimeric G protein then stimulates adenylate cyclase to produce cAMP. cAMP in turn activates PKA to phosphorylate its substrates, some of which are known to be critical for enhancing steroidogenesis (Fig. 16). For example, serine 195 of the StAR protein is a known PKA phosphorylation site which, when acted upon by PKA, stimulates the cholesterol transporting capability of StAR (8). These downstream pathways then mediate ACTH-induced aldosterone biosynthesis. However, it should be noted

![Diagram](#)

Figure 16 Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) signaling mediating aldosterone secretion from adrenal glomerulosa cells. ACTH binds to the melanocortin receptor (MC2R), a GPCR coupled to adenylate cyclase (AC) through the $G_{s}$ heterotrimeric G protein. Stimulated adenylate cyclase converts ATP to cAMP, thereby increasing cAMP levels, which in turn stimulate PKA. PKA increases calcium influx to increase intracellular calcium levels and activate CaMK (although one report suggests that the activation of CaMK by ACTH is independent of PKA). PKA and CaMK phosphorylate and activate ATF/CREB transcription factors to induce STAR and CYP11B2 expression, the early and late rate-limiting steps in aldosterone biosynthesis, respectively; PKA can also phosphorylate and stimulate the activity of StAR. The increase in StAR transcription and phosphorylation, in turn, promotes aldosterone production.

that the effects of ACTH on aldosterone production appear to be transient. Thus, infusion of ACTH induces an increase in serum aldosterone levels that returns to a basal value over time [reviewed in (24, 336)]. Whether this is due to continuously elevated ACTH levels rather than the intermittent increases in ACTH observed physiologically or to an ability of ACTH to promote a more fasciculata-like phenotype in the adrenal [reviewed in (135, 336)] is unclear. Nevertheless, the long-term role of ACTH in regulating aldosterone production in the adrenal is unclear, as no impairment of aldosterone release under various conditions is observed upon chronic treatment with agents that suppress ACTH secretion, whereas cortisol production is completely abrogated [reviewed in (336)].

### MC2R and G Protein Coupling

ACTH functions by binding to its receptor MC2R. Mice lacking the MC2R gene have been generated and show perinatal lethality with only approximately 25% surviving to adulthood (72). These mice exhibit fairly normal adrenal architecture, although the zona fasciculata is atrophied and the capsule is thickened. The zona glomerulosa appears normal and essentially normal amounts of aldosterone seem to be produced, although there is a complete lack of glucocorticoid (cortisol) production in these MC2R knockout animals (72). Nevertheless, these knockout mice exhibit a slight but not

---

Adenylate cyclase, cAMP, and PKA signaling

Glomerulosa cells express multiple isoforms of adenylate cyclase, which, upon activation by the alpha subunit of the $G_{s}$ G protein, produce the second messenger cAMP. By immunohistochemical techniques and western analysis, the human zona glomerulosa has been shown to express the calcium-sensitive adenylate cyclase isoforms, AC-1 and -3, the calcium inhibitable isoform, AC-5/6 and the $\beta\gamma$- and PKC-sensitive isoforms, AC-2 and -4 (81). Furthermore, calcium and a peptide that inhibits the interaction of $\beta\gamma$ with AC-2 can modulate ACTH-stimulated cAMP production in zona glomerulosa membrane preparations (81). Pertussis toxin enhances the ability of ACTH to increase cAMP production, suggesting
that MC2R is coupled not only to Gs but also to Gi in glomerulosa cells. Finally, ACTH-induced cAMP production is inhibited by antibodies to AC-2 and AC-5/6 (81), indicating the important role of these particular adenylate cyclase isoforms in ACTH-induced cAMP generation and thus aldosterone biosynthesis. Indeed, the expression of the calcium-sensitive adenylate cyclases may explain the ability of AngII to potentiate ACTH-induced cAMP formation through the hormone’s effects on capacitative calcium influx (54).

Finally, another PKA-independent effector of cAMP signaling, exchange protein activated by cAMP (Epac), has been reported to mediate diverse cellular responses in various cell types [reviewed in (44, 125)]. Epac serves as a GEF for Rap1 and 2, to promote the activation of these small GTPases, which then regulate various cell functions, including exocytosis and cell adhesion, as well as growth, division, differentiation, apoptosis and inflammation [also reviewed in (44, 125)]. Whether or not Epac proteins play a role in regulating ACTH-induced aldosterone production in zona glomerulosa cells is as yet unknown, although in one report the exposure of glomerulosa cells to a cAMP analog that specifically activates Epac proteins had no effect on aldosterone production (115). This result suggests, but does not prove, a lack of involvement of Epac proteins in ACTH-induced aldosterone production.

In addition, transcriptional activity of the transcription factor CREB can be regulated by PKA [reviewed in (152)]. Since CREB activity can stimulate expression of CYP11B2 and STAR [(67, 75, 126, 230) and see above and Fig. 11], as well as CYP11A1 (cholesterol side-chain cleavage complex), this PKA-mediated effect may also be important in regulating aldosterone production. Calcium influx also seems to be enhanced by the increased cAMP levels [reviewed in (314)]. Finally, it should be noted that a recent report has suggested that some effects of cAMP on aldosterone production in rat and bovine zona glomerulosa cells are independent of PKA and also of Epac, but instead involve CaMK (115). In this study aldosterone production stimulated by forskolin and cAMP analogs could be inhibited by a CaMK inhibitor. In addition, these agents were shown to stimulate CaMK activity (115), suggesting the possibility of an as yet undetermined link between cAMP and CaMK.

## Additional Regulators of Aldosterone Production

### Atrial natriuretic peptide

Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), formerly known as atrial natriuretic factor or ANF, is a hormone secreted from the heart atria which induces natriuresis, in part by inhibiting aldosterone secretion from the adrenal gland. Indeed, ANP levels correlate inversely with plasma aldosterone levels in humans and rise on a high-salt diet (306). Three receptors for ANP are known: two, natriuretic peptide receptor A (NPRA) and natriuretic peptide receptor B (NPRB) possess intrinsic guanylate cyclase activity, catalyzing the conversion of GTP to cGMP and thereby activating cGMP-dependent protein kinase or protein kinase G (PKG). The third receptor, the natriuretic peptide clearance receptor or NPRC is thought to clear ANP from the circulation by binding and sequestering the hormone. In glomerulosa cells ANP increases cGMP levels through NPRA to inhibit steroidogenesis induced by multiple ligands, including AngII and ACTH, as well as cAMP analogs and other pharmacological agents (17, 34, 149, 201). The increased cGMP levels presumably activate PKG, in particular PKG II, since mice lacking the gene encoding this enzyme do not exhibit the decrease in ACTH-stimulated aldosterone secretion in response to ANP that wild-type animals do (316). ANP also decreases cAMP levels (17, 201), presumably through its ability to activate a cGMP-stimulated phosphodiesterase enriched in the zona glomerulosa (201).

The exact mechanism of inhibition of steroidogenesis by ANP is as yet somewhat unclear but likely involves multiple mechanisms, including its ability to inhibit the activity of T-type calcium channels by shifting their inactivation to more negative membrane potentials (207), to stimulate potassium conductance thereby hyperpolarizing the glomerulosa cells (118), to inhibit PKC activity and decrease MARCKS phosphorylation (56), to reduce cholesterol mobilization to mitochondria (42, 70) and to decrease agonist-induced StAR

## Summary of ACTH signaling

To recapitulate, ACTH binds to the melanocortin receptor (MC2R) and activates adenylate cyclase via the heterotrimeric G protein, Gs. Adenylate cyclase converts ATP to cAMP, which, in turn, stimulates the activity of PKA. Exactly how PKA induces aldosterone secretion is incompletely understood, but it seems likely that its ability to phosphorylate the StAR protein (28) plays a key role in this process. In
phosphorylation and presumably cholesterol-transporting activity (56, 98). Indeed, an effect on cholesterol translocation from the outer to the inner mitochondrial membrane is supported by the inability of ANP to inhibit aldosterone secretion mediated by exposure of glomerulosa cells to 20-α-hydroxycholesterol, a cholesterol analog that bypasses StAR and other cholesterol transfer proteins to enter mitochondria directly (124). Finally, this idea is also consistent with the capacity of ANP to inhibit StAR mRNA and protein expression in response to a high calcium concentration in “calcium-clamped” glomerulosa cells (70). [For calcium clamping, glomerulosa cells are treated with the calcium ionophore ionomycin and maintained at a particular intracellular calcium concentration by incubation in medium with specified amounts of this ion (256).] In general, then, ANP appears to inhibit aldosterone synthesis and secretion through multiple mechanisms.

### Dopamine

Dopamine acting through the D2 receptor has been found to inhibit aldosterone biosynthesis in adrenal glomerulosa cells *in vitro* [e.g., (65, 215) and reviewed in (314)]. In addition, aldosterone-producing adenomas (a neoplastic but benign glomerulosa cell tumor) exhibits reduced D2 receptor mRNA and protein expression, with D2 receptor expression correlating inversely with *CYP11B2* expression (65). In other tissues hormone binding to appropriate receptors leads to the activation of a G<sub>i/o</sub> protein and the release of Gβ2γ2. Gβ2γ2, in turn, interacts with transient (T)-type calcium channels and inhibits their activity. Barrett and colleagues (141) have shown that in the H295R glomerulosa cell model this interaction occurs in response to dopamine receptor stimulation and requires T-channel phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent protein kinase or protein kinase A (PKA). Thus, both PKA activity and Gβ2γ2 are necessary to achieve T-channel inhibition in response to dopamine (141), and it is postulated that this might be one mechanism through which dopamine reduces aldosterone production in the adrenal gland. Another likely mechanism relates to the ability of D2 receptor stimulation to inhibit AngII-induced PKD activation, and consequently *CYP11B2* expression and aldosterone production in response to this agonist (65). However, whether dopamine is involved in regulating aldosterone production *in vivo* is controversial, as some investigators have found an ability of dopamine to inhibit (or dopamine receptor antagonists to stimulate) aldosterone production *in vivo* [for example, (1), although the results reported suggested a possibly indirect effect] and others have not [e.g., (148)].

### Acetylcholine

*In vitro* acetylcholine, or its more stable analog carbachol, is known to stimulate aldosterone production (37, 172). Carbachol stimulates similar signal transduction mechanisms as AngII, acting through a muscarinic receptor to induce phosphoinositide hydrolysis, a transient increase in cytosolic calcium levels, IP<sub>3</sub> and diacylglycerol generation, enhanced calcium influx and efflux and PLD activation (37, 172). Interestingly, carbachol triggers a smaller increase in calcium influx than does AngII and, in contrast to AngII, a biphasic, rather than monophasic, aldosterone secretory response (172). In addition, carbachol-stimulated PLD activity is transient whereas that induced by AngII is sustained (154). The ability of muscarinic receptor activation to trigger aldosterone production may also be relevant to the *in vivo* situation, as cholinergic neurons have been demonstrated to terminate among glomerulosa cells and around blood vessels in the rat adrenal cortex (150). Additional data obtained using microperfusion and acetylcholine muscarinic receptor antagonists suggest the likelihood of a direct cholinergic modulation of aldosterone production through M3 muscarinic receptors in the adrenal gland *in vivo* (150).

### Endothelin-1

Endothelin-1 (ET1) stimulates aldosterone production both *in vitro* and *in vivo* [for example, (26, 82, 214, 283) and reviewed in (284, 285)]. The adrenal gland expresses receptors for ET1 (82), and binding studies have demonstrated the presence of both the ET1 receptor A (ET<sub>A</sub>) and ET1 receptor B (ET<sub>B</sub>) in the human adrenal gland, and in particular in the zona glomerulosa [(89, 90, 281) and reviewed in (284, 285)]. Indeed, there may be an intraadrenal ET1 signaling system, as this gland has been reported to express prepro-ET1 as well as the ET1-converting enzyme that generates ET1 from the prohormone (282, 283). Although there may be species differences [reviewed in (285)], the aldosterone secretory response to ET1 appears to be mediated primarily by ET<sub>B</sub> receptors (3, 26) via coupling to a G<sub>q</sub> protein and stimulation of phosphoinositide hydrolysis (3). ET1 can also stimulate proliferation of adrenal glomerulosa cells, although this response seems to be mediated by the ET<sub>A</sub> receptor, through activation of PKC, tyrosine kinases, and EGFR transactivation (206, 299). The role of ET1 in regulating aldosterone levels *in vivo* is supported by the ability of ET1 infusion to increase serum aldosterone levels [e.g., (26, 214) and reviewed in (284, 285)]. In addition, there may be a potentiating interaction between ET1 and AngII [reviewed in (285)] and ET1 and ACTH (280) [although see discussion in (223)]. These results suggest that not only can ET1 induce aldosterone secretion on its own but also that this hormone may interact with other aldosterone secretagogues to modulate aldosterone production and thus blood pressure.

### Lipoproteins

Serum lipoproteins are known sources of the cholesterol precursor required for aldosterone biosynthesis, as discussed previously. However, evidence is accumulating to suggest possible further roles for these lipoproteins as signaling molecules in addition to their ability to provide precursor cholesterol for steroidogenesis. For example, HDL has been shown to stimulate aldosterone production in adrenal glomerulosa cells,
although this effect was assumed to relate to its ability to deliver cholesterol substrate to the cells for steroid production (69). However, more recently, HDL has been shown to stimulate CYP11B2 expression and aldosterone production in vitro through a mechanism involving SR-BI, changes in cytosolic calcium and activation of CaMK (342). Thus, HDL stimulates a transient increase in intracellular calcium levels, as well as Nurrl expression, and HDL’s induction of CYP11B2 expression could be inhibited by a voltage-dependent calcium channel antagonist and a CaMK inhibitor (342). In addition, inhibition or knockdown of SR-BI decreased the ability of HDL to stimulate CYP11B2 mRNA levels. It was further determined that a subfraction of HDL, HDL2 (rather than HDL3), is most efficient at inducing CYP11B2 expression (342).

Another lipoprotein with a possible signaling role is VLDL. VLDL, as a very low density lipoprotein, has high triglyceride content (about 50%) and serves to transport this lipid in the body. Previous studies have shown that in addition to transporting lipids, VLDL can regulate signaling pathways in different tissue types. For example, VLDL can inhibit Src-dependent assembly of fibronectin and type I collagen in vascular smooth muscle cells (111), and in hepatocyte- and macrophage-derived cell lines, VLDL has been shown to stimulate ERK-1/2 activity in a PKC-dependent manner, leading to increased expression of its own receptor (13, 192). Recent data in various glomerulosa cell models (293, 343) indicate that at physiologically relevant concentrations, VLDL induces aldosterone production, as do oxidized and glycoxidized VLDL. Of the three forms of VLDL, native and glycoxidized VLDL are approximately equally efficacious, followed by oxidized VLDL (293).

Studies to investigate the signaling pathways underlying VLDL’s effect have shown that in H295R cells, calcium is a major signal transduction pathway used by physiological levels of VLDL (343). Thus, VLDL increases cytosolic calcium levels (343), and inhibition of calcium influx with the voltage-dependent calcium channel antagonist nifedipine or of calcium’s actions with the CaMK inhibitor KN93 inhibits the ability of VLDL to increase aldosterone production (343). VLDL also increases StAR mRNA and protein expression, as well as CYP11B2 expression, and upregulates the mRNA and protein levels of the transcription factor Nurr-1, as well as the phosphorylation of ATF1 and ATF2 (343). Additional work has shown that in H295R cells VLDL, as well as glycoxidized and oxidized VLDL, can also activate ERK-1/2 (293) through a pathway involving SR-BI, the receptor traditionally thought to be key for cholesteryl ester uptake from HDL (184). Thus, the SR-BI inhibitor, BLT1, prevents the aldosterone production and CYP11B2 expression induced by native and glycoxidized VLDL, but not oxidized VLDL (which, however, triggers only a minimal response) (293). In addition, inhibitors of the ERK pathway, as well as the PKA and JAK/Stat pathways, reduce steroidogenesis elicited by these various VLDL forms. Interestingly, a p38 inhibitor enhances aldosterone production by the VLDLs (293).

The role of VLDL in regulating aldosterone levels in vivo is at present unclear. However, when rats are fed a high-fat diet (including also free access to a sucrose solution), adrenal expression of CYP11B2 rises in parallel with increased serum triglyceride levels (343), a measure of VLDL in postprandial individuals. In addition, obese patients typically have increases in lipoprotein levels, or dyslipidemia, and an elevated risk of hypertension and cardiovascular disease [reviewed in (161)]. Excess weight (especially visceral fat) is thought to be a major cause of increased blood pressure in many patients with essential hypertension, and weight gain is associated with increased blood pressure (153). The mechanism underlying this relationship is unclear, although several possibilities have been suggested, including increased activity of the sympathetic nervous system and the RAAS, excessive secretion of adipocytokines by the additional lipid stores, and the possible physical compression of the kidneys leading to dysregulation of renal blood pressure control mechanisms, especially with increased visceral adiposity (35, 86, 87). Importantly, some reports have shown a correlation between aldosterone levels, obesity and hypertension (97, 158, 221). Indeed, the increases in aldosterone levels observed seem not to be solely the consequence of an activated RAAS, since aldosterone levels in obese patients are greater than would be predicted by renin concentrations, with elevated aldosterone to renin ratios in these individuals (137, 273). This disparity between aldosterone and renin levels is particularly apparent in obese patients ingesting a high-salt diet, which suppresses renin activity (123). These findings suggest the possibility that in obese patients there is an alternative aldosterone regulatory system in addition to the conventional secretagogues. It remains to be seen whether VLDL affects aldosterone levels in vivo to provide a link between obesity and the dyslipidemia and hypertension associated with this condition in human patients.

### Sphingosine 1-phosphate

Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) has been shown to induce aldosterone production in various glomerulosa cell models in vitro. This sphingolipid metabolite appears to work in bovine zona glomerulosa cells through the S1P receptor-1 (S1P₁) and/or the S1P receptor-3 (S1P₃) and a pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein, as its effects are inhibited by the S1P₁/S1P₃ antagonist VPC 23019 and pertussis toxin, to activate various signal transduction mechanisms. The pathways activated by S1P include phosphoinositide hydrolysis and stimulation of PKC, PLD, ERK-1/2 and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) activity (48, 49). In the human adrenocortical carcinoma glomerulosa cell model H295R, S1P has been shown to increase the expression of multiple steroidogenic proteins, including STAR, TSPO, and SR-BI (and LDLR) (199). As in bovine glomerulosa cells, the stimulation of steroidogenesis in response to S1P occurs through S1P₁ and/or S1P₃, a pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein andactivation of ERK-1/2 (as well as CaMK), although in this particular report the secretion of cortisol rather than aldosterone was monitored (199). Nevertheless, the increased expression of STAR should also promote aldosterone biosynthesis. Whether S1P plays a role in regulating aldosterone production in vivo is as yet unknown.

# Other regulators of aldosterone production

Because of the sensitivity of isolated adrenal glomerulosa cells, a large number of substances have been observed to increase or decrease aldosterone secretion *in vitro*. These range in complexity from protons and hydrogen peroxide (180, 264) to more complex molecules such as serotonin and oxidized linoleic acid derivatives [(122, 274) and reviewed in (314)] to macromolecules such as bone morphogenetic protein-6 (147) and cryptochrome-1 and -2 involved in regulating circadian rhythm (94). However, whether these agents participate in normal or pathological regulation of aldosterone secretion in humans *in vivo* is at present unclear and awaits further study.

# Possible Additional Functions of Glomerulosa Cells

In addition to producing and secreting aldosterone, zona glomerulosa cells may also have other functions in the adrenal gland. In particular, it is hypothesized that glomerulosa cells may serve as progenitor cells to generate cells of the adrenal cortex, for example, of the zona fasciculata and reticularis [reviewed in (330)]. Thus, not all cells in the outer adrenal cortex with morphological characteristics of glomerulosa cells express CYP11B2 mRNA and/or protein (although whether these cells are in fact truly glomerulosa cells can be questioned). Furthermore, evidence for localization of adrenocortical stem cells in the outer adrenal cortex (possibly the capsule) and their centripetal migration to populate the adrenal cortex [reviewed in (308)] has led to the proposal that zona glomerulosa cells are not terminally differentiated but proliferate to maintain the adrenal cortex. However, this idea is not entirely supported by recent data. Thus, studies in the adult mouse adrenal gland demonstrate that proliferating cells in the outer adrenal cortex are largely steroidogenic enzyme-negative and not only migrate centripetally to populate the zona fasciculata/reticularis but also remain stationary in (or may even migrate outward to) the outer cortex (66). These authors propose that a single stem cell population (or perhaps two separate populations) in the outer cortex (zona glomerulosa layer) proliferate and differentiate to form either CYP11B2-positive zona glomerulosa cells or zona fasciculata/reticularis cells. This result is consistent with lineage tracing studies demonstrating that in the mouse adrenal gland, sonic hedgehog (SHH)- and SF1-positive, CYP11B2-negative cells in the capsule and outer cortex can differentiate into CYP11B2- or CYP11B1-positive zona glomerulosa or zona fasciculata cells (respectively) [reviewed in (186, 308)].

Together, these results suggest that a distinction may be made between differentiated aldosterone-producing glomerulosa cells and undifferentiated stem/progenitor cells that maintain the adrenal cortex and are located in the outer cortex. Nevertheless, an argument could be made that their localization in the zona glomerulosa layer identifies these progenitor cells as zona glomerulosa cells.

## Conclusion

Aldosterone is the primary mineralocorticoid hormone involved in maintaining fluid and electrolyte balance in the body. Excessive production/secretion of this hormone results in hypertension, contributes to cardiac fibrosis and congestive heart failure, and exacerbates the morbidity and mortality associated with these disorders. Many medications used to treat hypertension antagonize some aspect of the RAAS and are important therapies for treating various cardiovascular conditions. Nevertheless, medical control of blood pressure is often sub-optimal, suggesting the necessity of discovering additional selective agents for the development of anti-hypertensive therapies. A complete understanding of the mechanisms underlying aldosterone secretion may assist in identifying other signaling molecules that could potentially be targeted to inhibit aldosterone production and treat aldosterone-related hypertension, primary aldosteronism, congestive heart failure and other cardiovascular disorders.
