Relaxin Family Peptides and Their Receptors. *Physiol Rev* 93: 405–480, 2013; doi:10.1152/physrev.00001.2012.—There are seven relaxin family peptides that are all structurally related to insulin. Relaxin has many roles in female and male reproduction, as a neuropeptide in the central nervous system, as a vasodilator and cardiac stimulant in the cardiovascular system, and as an antifibrotic agent. Insulin-like peptide-3 (INSL3) has clearly defined specialist roles in male and female reproduction, relaxin-3 is primarily a neuropeptide involved in stress and metabolic control, and INSL5 is widely distributed particularly in the gastrointestinal tract. Although they are structurally related to insulin, the relaxin family peptides produce their physiological effects by activating a group of four G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), relaxin family peptide receptors 1–4 (RXFP1–4). Relaxin and INSL3 are the cognate ligands for RXFP1 and RXFP2, respectively, that are leucine-rich repeat containing GPCRs. RXFP1 activates a wide spectrum of signaling pathways to generate second messengers that include cAMP and nitric oxide, whereas RXFP2 activates a subset of these pathways. Relaxin-3 and INSL5 are the cognate ligands for RXFP3 and RXFP4 that are closely related to small peptide receptors that when activated inhibit cAMP production and activate MAP kinases. Although there are still many unanswered questions regarding the mode of action of relaxin family peptides, it is clear that they have important physiological roles that could be exploited for therapeutic benefit.

I. INTRODUCTION: THE DISCOVERY OF
RELAXIN FAMILY PEPTIDES AND THEIR
RECEPTORS

A. The Discovery of the Relaxin Family
Peptides

Relaxin was discovered and named by Dr. Frederick Hisaw following observations of the reproductive endocrinology of the gopher and later the guinea pig. He noticed that there was softening and expansion of the pubic ligament just prior to delivery in the pregnant female that facilitated parturition. In 1926 he showed that the injection of serum from pregnant guinea pigs or rabbits caused relaxation of the pubic ligament of virgin guinea pigs when given shortly after estrus (220). The following year the same relaxing factor was shown to be present in pig corpus luteum and rabbit placenta (221). The hormone was formally named relaxin after it was extracted from pig corpus luteum in 1930 (165). For the next 15 years or so, relatively little work was done with relaxin, but post World War II there was a reawakening of interest in its physiological role that established properties that would be useful in understanding its roles in pregnancy and parturition. These included, in estrogen-primed animals, expansion of the public ligament of mice (193, 195), relaxation of the uterine myometrium in guinea pigs (295), and cervical softening in cattle. The subsequent purification of relaxin from animal sources (initially pigs but then many other species) led to the determination of the peptide structure, biological actions and generation of reliable bioassays. The information obtained from the determination of the peptide structure enabled the use of recombinant DNA techniques to clone the rat (244) and pig (192) relaxin cDNAs that demonstrated a close structural relationship with insulin (FIGURE 1A).

FIGURE 1. Relationship between relaxin family peptides, insulin, and insulin-like peptides. A: CLUSTALW (v1.83) alignment of human relaxin/insulin family peptides. Relaxin and insulin family peptide sequences are from the UniProt/SwissProt database: human relaxin-1 (P04808), human relaxin-2 (P04090), human relaxin-3 (Q8WXF3), human INSL 3 (P51460), human INSL 4 (Q14641), human INSL 5 (Q9Y5Q6), human INSL 6 (Q9Y581), human IGF I (P01343), human IGF II (P01344), and human insulin (P01308). Conserved cysteine residues are black with gray background. Solid black lines indicate disulfide bonds. Identical amino acid residues are indicated by *. The insulin-like growth factors are not cleaved from the pro-hormone state, thus indicating that the sequence of these peptides is continuous. B: an unrooted phylogenetic tree derived using the neighbor joining method in CLUSTALW. Human peptide sequences were edited to delete the C and signal peptide sequences. The resulting domains corresponding to the B and A chains were further edited to minimize gaps, and then concatenated (562). The phylogenetic tree was formatted using the program Dendroscope (249). C: A-chains and B-chains of the cognate relaxin family peptides for RXFP 1–4 superimposed on one another. This demonstrates the extraordinary degree of structural similarity between the peptides that differ mainly in the mid and COOH-terminal regions of the B-chain.

of a human genomic library resulting in the cloning of human gene-1 relaxin (RLN 1) (245) followed by the isolation of a second gene, human gene-2 relaxin (RLN 2), from a human luteal cDNA library (246). It has subsequently been shown that humans and higher primates have RLN 1 and RLN 2 genes, whereas other mammals have only RLN 1. Importantly, the peptide encoded by the human RLN 2 gene

and the RLN 1 gene from other mammals encodes the relaxin peptide circulating during pregnancy. The function of the RLN 1 gene in humans and higher primates is unknown. The ability to clone human relaxin genes and species homologs led to the production of relaxin by recombinant techniques and the development of the relaxin knockout

RELAXIN FAMILY PEPTIDES AND THEIR RECEPTORS

mouse. Furthermore, cloning strategies or database searching using the conserved relaxin peptide structure led to the discovery of a variety of related peptides. These include insulin-like peptide 3 (INSL3) (2), INSL4 (94) by differential cloning, and INSL5 (100) and INSL6 (236) by expressed sequence tags (EST) database screening. The most recent addition, relaxin-3, was discovered by screening the human genomic database (46). In humans, the seven relaxin family peptides that have been identified are encoded by genes that possess a similar structure (FIGURE 1, A AND C) and synthesize similar prepropeptides (241). The mature peptides are all predicted or proven to be processed from the prepropeptides by convertases to produce two chain peptides that all have an A-chain linked to a B-chain by two disulfide bonds with an additional intrachain disulfide in the A chain (see section II).

Although many of the relaxin family peptides were discovered as a result of their roles in reproduction, it is now clear that they perform a wide variety of physiological functions in humans. Some such as relaxin have widely differing roles between species, whereas others such as relaxin-3 and INSL3 have well-conserved roles in all mammalian species.

### B. The Relaxin Peptides

As mentioned above, a relaxin gene is present in all mammals and is responsible for the production of the relaxin peptide that is circulating in the blood during pregnancy. However, the levels of relaxin in the blood during pregnancy are very different between species and correlate with the varied roles for relaxin in pregnancy and parturition in different species (see sect. IVA). In humans, blood levels of relaxin are highest in the first trimester, and consequently, relaxin is not associated with parturition in humans. Nevertheless, it is likely that in humans, relaxin has a role in the early stages of pregnancy and also in the cardiovascular changes that accompany pregnancy. Furthermore, it is becoming increasingly clear that relaxin is produced in many tissues in mammals as a paracrine or autocrine factor to exert many different physiological roles (see sect. IVA).

Relaxin-3 is the most recently identified relaxin family peptide and was discovered following a search of the human genomic database (46). It is classified as a relaxin peptide based on the RxxxRxxI/V relaxin-binding motif in the B-chain, despite an otherwise relatively low sequence homology to other relaxin peptides (FIGURE 1A). Unlike the other relaxins, which show considerable species heterogeneity apart from the relaxin binding motif and key structural residues, the relaxin-3 sequences are well-conserved across species (562, 574). It is now widely accepted that relaxin-3 is the ancestral peptide of the relaxin family peptides (562) and that in mammals is primarily a neuropeptide expressed almost exclusively in brain (46). Functions likely to be associated with relaxin-3 include stress, memory, and appetite regulation (see sect. VIIC) (25, 329, 358, 516).

### C. INSL3, 4, 5, and 6

INSL3 (formerly Leydig insulin-like peptide) was discovered in the Leydig cells of the testis (2) and is highly expressed in these cells in all species that possess the INSL3 gene (47). Although there is evidence for INSL3 expression in other tissues (see sect. IVB), this occurs at much lower levels than in the Leydig cells. As such, INSL3 has a critical role in testis descent, and INSL3 knockout mice are cryptorchid and as a consequence infertile (379, 596). INSL3 plays an important role in the development of the gubernaculum, which is important in the first stage of testis descent, and it also appears to have a role in the maintenance of fertility in females (490) (see sect. VIIB).

Compared with the other relaxin family peptides, very little information is available regarding INSL4–6. INSL4 is highly expressed in the placenta (94) and may play a role in bone development (303), but its target receptor has yet to be identified. INSL5 on the other hand has quite a wide distribution pattern (see sect. IVD) with particularly high expression in the gastrointestinal tract (100). Although INSL5 knockout mice have been developed, the associated phenotype is currently not well characterized; nevertheless, there may be functional effects on fat and glucose metabolism [patent WO 2005124361 (A3)]. This is of interest given that the related peptides insulin and the insulin-like growth factors, IGF-I and IGF-II, have well-defined roles in glucose metabolism. INSL5 activates RXFP4 with high potency but unlike relaxin-3 does not activate RXFP1 or RXFP3 and in fact is a weak antagonist at RXFP3 (315). It is now widely accepted that INSL5 is the cognate ligand for RXFP4 (212, 315). INSL6 was discovered by screening EST databases (236, 275, 317) and like INSL3 is found predominantly in the testis. Specific localization of peptide expression in spermatocytes and spermatids suggests a role for INSL6 in male fertility, and male INSL6 knockout mice show a marked reduction in sperm numbers and motility (85). The receptor for INSL6 is currently unknown.

### D. Receptors for the Relaxins and Insulin-like Peptides

The search for the cognate receptors for the relaxin family peptides proved demanding and was complicated by the close similarity between relaxin family peptides and insulin which together with studies that showed an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of a 220-kDa protein in response to relaxin (407) suggested that they were tyrosine kinases. However, the key insights came from an unlikely direction when it was noticed that INSL3 knockout mice (379, 596) shared the same phenotype of abnormal testis descent as mice with disruptions in the G protein-coupled receptor encoded by the GREAT gene (later shown to be the mouse ortholog of human LGR8) (406). This suggested that the targets for relaxin family peptides might be GPCRs and subsequently led to the deorphanization of LGR7 and LGR8 (239). Construction of constitutively active

BATHGATE ET AL.

tive mutants of LGR7 and LGR8 showed that these receptors likely signaled by activating the adenylyl cyclase pathway and further stimulation of these receptors by relaxin resulted in increases in cAMP (239). A subsequent study demonstrated that, as anticipated from the studies above, LGR8 is the receptor for INSL3 (65, 301). Two other orphan receptors GPCR135 and GPCR142 were shown to be the targets for relaxin-3 and INSL5, respectively (313, 314). These receptors have now been classified as relaxin family peptide (RXFP) receptors: RXFP1 (LGR7*), RXFP2 (LGR8*), RXFP3 (GPCR135*), and RXFP4 (GPCR142*) (*these are the previously used names for the RXFP receptors prior to reclassification by NC-IUPHAR) [FIGURE 2D] (42). Cognate receptors for INSL4 and INSL6 have yet to be identified, and these peptides do not interact with any of the RXFP receptors.

RXFP1 is the cognate receptor for human relaxin-2 in humans that in addition to the classical 7-transmembrane spanning regions has a large extracellular domain containing 10 leucine-rich repeats (LRR) and a unique NH₂-terminal low-density lipoprotein receptor type A (LDLa) module (239) [FIGURE 3]. As befitting the roles of relaxin in reproduction, RXFP1 mRNA and protein are found in a wide range of reproductive tissues including ovary, uterus, placenta, mammary gland, prostate, and testis [FIGURE 4]. The receptor is also found in the heart, kidney, lung, liver, and blood cells as well as in a number of areas of brain such as cortex, organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis (OVLT), and subfornical organ (SFO) (see TABLE 1 and sect. VA). Thus relaxin not only has autocrine and paracrine roles but also acts as a neuropeptide. In-

teraction of relaxin with RXFP1 involves at least three stages: high-affinity binding between the B-chain and the LRR region; lower affinity binding to the transmembrane exoloops, and finally an interaction involving the LDLa module that is essential for signaling (199, 501) [FIGURE 3]. Although RXFP1 couples to numerous signal transduction pathways (see sect.VIA), many early studies indicated that treatment with relaxin caused increases in cAMP levels in tissues (69, 95, 96, 446). This link with cAMP signaling was strengthened in the studies that deorphanized LGR7 (RXFP1) where it was shown that a constitutively active receptor mutant generated cAMP (239) [FIGURE 3]. This has been confirmed in numerous studies that show that RXFP1 couples to at least three G proteins to induce a complex pattern of cAMP production (198, 202, 204). In addition, RXFP1 is known to activate Erk1/2, tyrosine kinase(s), gene transcription, and nitric oxide (NO) signaling and can also interact with the glucocorticoid receptor (GC). The full implications of the pleiotropic effects of relaxin are still to be elucidated.

RXFP2 shares very close structural similarity with RXFP1 (239) and is the cognate receptor for INSL3 (301). It has a much more restricted distribution, physiological function, and signaling profile than RXFP1 [FIGURE 4; TABLE 1]. RXFP2 is expressed in the gubernaculum as anticipated from its critical role in testicular descent but is also expressed in the testis and ovary relating to roles in gonadal function (276) and in bone relating to a role in bone metabolism (161) (see TABLE 1 and sect. VIIB). RXFP2 signaling also involves adenylyl cyclase activation, but this is re-

FIGURE 2. Evolutionary relationships between human RXFP receptors and other family A GPCRs. Receptors showing similarity to RXFP1 or RXFP3 were identified by using complete transmembrane domain amino acid sequences (from the beginning of helix 1 through to the COOH terminus) to conduct BLAST searches against the human REFSEQ protein database. Sequences showing the greatest similarity with each of RXFP1 or RXFP3 were then aligned using CLUSTALW, and a phylogenetic tree derived by the neighbor-joining method, also in CLUSTALW. A: the phylogenetic tree shows that RXFP1 and RXFP2 are closely related to each other, with 59% sequence identity and 80% similarity based on conservative amino acid changes. They form a subgroup that also includes the three glycoprotein hormone receptors for thyroid stimulating hormone (TSHR), luteinizing hormone/chorionic gonadotropin (LHCGR), and follicle stimulating hormone (FSHR). These receptors show somewhat higher homology to RXFP1 and RXFP2 (27–29% identity, 49–51% similarity) than a second group comprising the leucine-rich repeat-containing receptors LGR4, LGR5, and LGR6 (22–25% identity, 46–47% similarity). RXFP1 and RXFP2 are also related to family A bioamine receptors such as β-adrenoceptors (ARs) and adenosine receptors, as well as additional peptide receptors. B: the RXFP3 and RXFP4 amino acid sequences that display 43% sequence identity and 60% similarity are most closely related to a subgroup comprising the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AGTR1), the apelin receptor (APLNR) and the chemokine receptor (CCR1), and a second subgroup containing neuropeptide receptors including members of the somatostatin and opioid receptor families and the neuropeptide B/W receptor (NPBWR1). They are also related to various chemokine receptors (CXCR7, CXCR4, CCR1, and CCR9) and to the formyl peptide receptors (FPR2 and FPR3). C: the RXFP1/RXFP2 and RXFP3/RXFP4 receptor subgroups are not highly related to each other, and in fact, the only significant homology between RXFP1 and RXFP3 is within the highly conserved TM7 motif NSxLNP(I/V)Y that is essential for G protein coupling as well as neighboring key residues in helix 8. RXFP1 and RXFP4 show slightly higher homology, although again the regions of similarity encompass only short motifs in TM3, TM6, and TM7. Instead, both receptor subgroups are related to other family A GPCRs such as the β₂-AR and the adenosine A2B receptor. In essence, these bioamine receptors occupy a bridge between the distinct RXFP1/RXFP2 and RXFP3/RXFP4 subgroups. For example, the β₂-AR has homologies with each of the RXFP1 and RXFP3 receptors, with 23% identity/39% similarity to RXFP1 and 21% identity/38% similarity to RXFP3. D: RXFP1 and RXFP2 are closely related to each other and have a characteristic extracellular leucine-rich repeat region and a unique low-density lipoprotein receptor class A module at the NH2 terminus. In contrast, RXFP3 and RXFP4 are both similar to small peptide (e.g., bradykinin, angiotensin II) liganded receptors. The primary ligands for each RXFP are shown in FIGURE 1. Whereas the RXFP1/RXFP2 and RXFP3/RXFP4 receptors belong to separate subtrees, the endogenous ligands do not show a corresponding split in lineage. Based on BLASTP and also PSI-BLAST searches using the human relaxin-2 B chain sequence, human relaxin-3 is somewhat more similar than INSL3 (57% identity, 67% similarity versus 52% identity, 62% similarity, respectively), while INSL5 is the least related. Searches using the A chain sequence indicate that human relaxin-3 and INSL3 are equivalent in their homology to human relaxin-2, and again INSL5 is more distantly related. Thus human relaxin-3 is closely related to human relaxin-2 despite the corresponding primary receptors residing in different subgroups. This is not surprising given the distinct nature of the ligand binding domains in each receptor subgroup and indicates that the capacity to bind related peptides has arisen by a process of convergent evolution.

FIGURE 3. Structural features of the relaxin family peptide receptor RXFP1. The RXFP1 receptor has a large extracellular domain that contains an NH₂-terminal low-density lipoprotein receptor type A (LDLa) module connected to a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) region tethered to the transmembrane domains of the receptor by a unique hinge region (237). The primary high-affinity binding site for relaxin is located in the LRR region, but the peptide also interacts with a lower affinity binding site located on the extracellular loops (199, 501). An intact LDLa module at the NH₂ terminus is essential for signaling (231, 280, 456) which involves the third intracellular loop. Protein-protein interactions important for signaling occur with helix 8 and the COOH-terminal tail of RXFP1 (196, 198, 201, 204).

stricted to a subset of the G proteins utilized by RXFP1 (see sect. VIB). Although in the cell systems often used to study RXFP2 activation of the receptor causes an overwhelming increase in cAMP levels, in endogenously expressing systems both increases and decreases in cAMP are seen. For instance, in gubernacular cells (301) or osteoblasts (161), activation of RXFP2 causes increased cAMP, but in male germ cells and oocytes, the opposite effect is observed (276). This may reflect the particular expression pattern of signaling proteins in the various cells (202). Interestingly, some species relaxins have been shown to activate RXFP2 in vitro

(45, 239, 301, 453) but the physiological significance (if any) of this interaction is not clear. There is no evidence that relaxin can activate RXFP2 in vivo. Mouse relaxin does not activate RXFP2 (45), indicating that studies in the RXFP1 knockout mouse will not resolve possible physiological actions of relaxin at RXFP2.

RXFP3 and RXFP4 are both similar to type 1 small peptide receptors and are distinctly different in structure from RXFP1 and RXFP2 (FIGURE 2D). RXFP3 was originally named SALPR or somatostatin and angiotensin-like pep-

RELAXIN FAMILY PEPTIDES AND THEIR RECEPTORS

II. MOLECULAR BIOLOGY, SYNTHESIS, STRUCTURE, AND IDENTIFICATION OF FEATURES IMPORTANT FOR ACTIVITY OF RELAXIN FAMILY PEPTIDES

A. Molecular Biology of Relaxin Family Peptides

Although the relaxin peptide was initially described in the 1920s, the first relaxin gene sequence was not cloned until the early 1980s. At this time, cloning of porcine (192) and rat (244) relaxin was achieved by screening of corpus luteum cDNA libraries. These studies confirmed that relaxin, like insulin, is synthesized as a preprohormone with four distinct regions: a signal peptide, a B-chain, a C-chain, and a COOH-terminal A-chain. Relaxin cDNA and gene sequences were subsequently cloned from a number of mammalian species (43). Additionally, multiple new mammalian relaxin gene sequences are now available in the genome databases. All of these sequences show a similar gene structure and possess two exons interrupted by an intron, which is situated in the middle of the C-peptide sequence.

The first human relaxin gene was cloned by screening a genomic library using the porcine relaxin cDNA sequence and was designated the human RLN1 gene with the peptide product termed H1 relaxin (human relaxin-1) (245). However, a year later, the same researchers isolated an additional relaxin gene by screening a corpus luteum cDNA library (246). This gene was designated RLN2 and the gene product termed H2 relaxin (human relaxin-2) (see footnote 1). The RLN2 product sequence was identical to that of the relaxin peptide that was subsequently isolated from the human corpus luteum (126, 566), and two relaxin genes are only present in higher primates (562). Thus the human relaxin-2 peptide is the equivalent of the relaxin peptide first discovered by Hisaw in lower species. The function of the human relaxin-1 peptide is currently unknown, although a synthetic human relaxin-1 peptide based on the RLN1 sequence activates the relaxin receptor (46, 514). The human RLN1 and RLN2 genes are located sequentially on chromosome 9 at 9p24 adjacent to the INSL4 and INSL6 genes.

In contrast to the cloning of the relaxin genes, the other members of the relaxin peptide family were discovered as novel cDNA clones in differential cloning projects or by screening of EST or genomic databases. All of the new members retain the relaxin-like preprohormone peptide structure and a similar gene structure to RLN with two exons interrupted by an intron situated in the middle of the C-peptide sequence. INSL3 was discovered by researchers searching for genes highly expressed in the pig (2) and

"In this review the terminology species relaxin-1, relaxin-2, relaxin-3, etc. is used for the relaxin peptides."
mouse testis (424), and it was initially called Leydig insulin-like peptide (Ley-I-L) due to its high expression in the testicular Leydig cells. Subsequent cloning of the INSL3 gene from numerous mammalian species has confirmed its high expression in the Leydig cells of mammals (259). The human INSL3 gene is located on chromosome 19at19p13.2. INSL4 was independently identified as a highly expressed gene in the human placenta by two groups and was initially called placenta insulin-like peptide (EPIL) (94) or placentin (289). The INSL4 gene, like the RLN1 gene, is only present in higher primates, although there is evidence to suggest that INSL4 emerged prior to RLN1 (56).

The advent of the EST databases provided an opportunity to search for insulin-like genes using the conserved A- and B-chain core sequences. Human INSL5 was identified from a colon EST library (100), whereas an independent group discovered mouse INSL5 from a mouse colon EST clone (236). The mouse clone was originally called relaxin/insulin-like factor 2 (RIF2) and was discovered together with mouse INSL6 that was called RIF1. Two other independent groups also discovered mouse (275) and human (317) INSL6 in testis cDNA libraries. Both INSL5 and INSL6 have been subsequently cloned from numerous mammalian species and shown to be highly expressed in the colon and testis, respectively (42). The human INSL5 gene is located on chromosome 1at1p31.3.

The human and mouse RLN3 genes were discovered by searching the human genome sequence using the relaxin B-chain (46). The human RLN3 gene is located on chromosome 19at19p13.2, ~3mB from the INSL3 gene. The RLN3 gene has subsequently been identified in all of the sequenced mammalian genomes and all other vertebrates including fish, birds, and amphibians (49, 241, 562). Indeed, bioinformatic analyses showed that RLN3 emerged prior to the divergence of fish, as RLN3 orthologs are present in *Takifugu rubripes* and *Danio rerio* (562). Phylogenetic analyses also suggest that teleosts possess two orthologs that group closely with mammalian relaxin-3, but not with the main circulating form of relaxin (410). The high homology between orthologs in the mature peptide region demonstrates that RLN3 is under strong purifying selection, unlike the gene encoding relaxin (563). This is thought to reflect the differences between relaxin and relaxin-3 receptor interactions and function. Together, the highly conserved sequence homology and expression of relaxin-3 in the brain indicate that it is an important neuropeptide (see sect. IVC).

The RLN3 gene encoding human relaxin-3 is likely to be the ancestral gene from which a series of gene duplications gave rise to other members of the relaxin family (562). It is not possible to assign any order to the divergence between insulin and the relaxin family peptides; however, insulin, IGF-I, and IGF-II clearly form a separate subgroup. An analysis based on peptides from 15 species showed that

human relaxin-3 and INSL5 are closely related to each other and cluster within a subtree that is distinct from the group comprising human relaxin-1, human relaxin-2, INSL3, INSL4, and INSL6 (562). The analysis shown in **FIGURE 1B** based on human peptide sequences also demonstrates the close relationship between human relaxin-3 and INSL5; however, these peptides are clustered within a subtree that also contains human relaxin-1, human relaxin-2, and INSL6. From this analysis, INSL3 is not more closely related to human relaxin-2 than the human relaxin-3/INSL5 peptides. The previous analysis is based on a much larger data set and provides a comprehensive view of relaxin family peptide evolution across diverse species (562). The discrepancy with the tree based only on the human peptides reflects the short input sequences available for comparison, and the fact that the level of homology between key members of the relaxin peptide family is almost the same. BLASTP searches (National Center for Biotechnology Information) provide measures of amino acid identity as well as similarity based on conservative changes between residues that are structurally conserved. The phylogenetic tree shown here (**FIGURE 1**) reflects the fact that human relaxin-2 is slightly more homologous to human relaxin-3 than to INSL3. Compared with the core 23-amino acid human relaxin-2 B chain sequence, human relaxin-3 has 12 identical residues and an additional 2 conservative changes, while INSL3 has 10 identical residues and 2 further conservative changes. Compared with the core 20-amino acid A chain sequence of human relaxin-2, INSL3 has 8 identical residues and no additional conservative changes, and human relaxin-3 has 7 identical residues. The combined B/A chain CLUSTALW analysis places human relaxin-2 closer to human relaxin-3 than INSL3; however, this is due to an overall difference in homology of one amino acid. This analysis is not improved by including the C peptide regions, as these show much greater divergence in both length and sequence than the A and B chains. Based on the CLUSTALW and BLASTP analyses, it is reasonable to conclude that human relaxin-1, human relaxin-2, human relaxin-3, INSL5, INSL6, and INSL3 all form a subtree with at least 42% identity and 47% similarity between members, and that not all branch positions within this grouping are likely to be significant.

### B. Structure of Relaxins and Insulin-like Peptides

As mentioned previously (see sect. IIA), the conserved prohormone structure of the relaxin family peptides (consisting of a signal peptide, B-chain, C-chain, and COOH-terminal A-chain) necessitates a degree of processing to produce the mature, active peptide. It is thought that the signal peptide is removed, followed by the enzymatic removal of the C-peptide, to form a mature heterodimeric peptide with two disulfide bonds between the A- and B-chains and an additional intra-A-chain bond. However, the cleavage of the C-peptide has only been directly demonstrated for some of the peptides.
RELAXIN FAMILY PEPTIDES AND THEIR RECEPTORS

The native relaxin peptide has been isolated and characterized from numerous species, which allowed the confirmation of a two-chain, three-disulfide bonded structure similar to insulin (FIGURE 1A) (42). A similar native structure, generated by enzymatic removal of the connecting C-peptide, has been confirmed for bovine INSL3 (76) and porcine relaxin-3 (314). Although there is also some evidence for cleavage of the C-peptide during INSL6 processing (323), a mature, native peptide has yet to be isolated for both INSL4 and INSL5. Structural studies on recombinant human relaxin-2 (144) and synthetic INSL3 (435), human relaxin-3 (434), and INSL5 (211) have enabled the determination of the three-dimensional structures of the peptides (FIGURE 1C).

The crystal structure of the human relaxin-2 peptide confirmed that the overall fold is similar to insulin (144). Furthermore, human relaxin-2 forms an asymmetrical dimer in a manner resembling insulin, although the human relaxin-2 dimer occurs in a different orientation. Indeed, all relaxin family peptides share a common overall fold but have differences around their termini (FIGURE 1C) (433). Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies of human relaxin-3 show that it has a broadly similar structure to human relaxin-2 and insulin. However, when compared with the X-ray crystal structure of human relaxin-2, human relaxin-3 has a more hydrophobic core with a condensed B-chain α-helix. This “tightness” allows the B-chain tryptophan at position 27 to interact with the hydrophobic core of the peptide (434). In contrast, the B-chain α-helix in human relaxin-2 is one helix turn longer, forcing the tryptophan to face away from the core of the molecule where it is solvent exposed (FIGURE 1C) (434). This orientation of the COOH terminus of the B-chain of human relaxin-2 is similar to that of the COOH terminus of INSL5 determined by NMR (212). In contrast, the NMR structure of INSL3 reveals a COOH-terminal orientation that is more similar to human relaxin-3, with the COOH terminus contacting the hydrophobic core (434). Despite this, the COOH termini of human relaxin-3 and INSL3 still show disparity in the precise orientation of the COOH terminus of the B-chain, that has direct ramifications for the key role of the COOH-terminal tryptophan in the activity of these peptides (see sect. IIC). Interestingly, a synthetic INSL4 peptide based on a putative heterodimeric mature peptide structure is largely unstructured in solution (79, 310), bringing into question whether INSL4 is actually produced as a prohormone in vivo.

different species was the first step in determining the structure-activity relationships of relaxin family peptides, their receptors, and downstream signaling effectors. Alignment of the amino acid sequences of relaxin peptides from rat, tiger shark, dogfish, rabbit, horse, skate, minke whale, dog, human, dolphin, and cow allowed the identification of key conserved residues, i.e., those most likely to be important for the structure-activity relationships of relaxin (470). Aside from the essential cysteine residues, these alignments highlighted a conserved RxxRxxI/V motif located in the B-chain α-helix (FIGURE 5). The X-ray crystal structure of relaxin indicates that the arginine residues are located on the first and second loop of the α-helix and face away from the core of the molecule (FIGURE 1C) (144). The outward-facing arginines form the receptor binding site for relaxin, in conjunction with an isoleucine or valine residue that is located on the same face of the B-chain α-helix (452, 513). Substitution of the arginine, isoleucine, or valine residues in this motif markedly reduces or obliterates activity (FIGURE 5) (452, 513), highlighting that these residues are critical for the activity of the relaxin peptide.

Analysis of the relaxin family peptides showed that the A-chain of the relaxins had greater sequence divergence than the B-chains (470) (FIGURE 1A). Other than the conserved cysteine residues, only G14 seems to be highly conserved (FIGURE 5) and is essential for maintaining chain flexibility and structure (73). Therefore, it was assumed that the relaxin peptide A-chains would play a less important role in receptor binding and activation than the B-chain. Truncation of the A-chain of human relaxin-2 results in a peptide that progressively loses the ability to bind to and activate both RXFP1 and RXFP2 (232). It was thought that this might be due to the loss of structure in the B-chain resulting from the truncation. However, a recent study demonstrated that targeted point-mutations within the human relaxin-2 A-chain can selectively alter receptor binding and activation profile: alanine substitution at the A16 and A17 positions, (T16A and K17A, respectively) did not markedly alter the cAMP response to RXFP1 activation, but enhanced cAMP accumulation following peptide binding to RXFP2 compared with wild-type control (FIGURE 5); furthermore, alanine substitution of residues A22 and A23 (R22A and F23A, respectively) markedly reduced the human relaxin-2 activity at RXFP2 without reducing binding or activity at RXFP1 (FIGURE 5) (410). Additionally, double alanine substitutions at positions A19 and A20 (S19A and L20A, respectively) also reduced peptide binding and activity at RXFP1, again suggesting that residues of the human relaxin-2 A-chain are important for receptor binding and activation (FIGURE 5) (73). This study also highlights differences in the mechanisms by which relaxin can bind to and activate RXFP1 compared with RXFP2 (FIGURE 1C). Differences in the mechanism of binding and activation between RXFP1 and RXFP2 are further supported by the species-specific nature of these structure-activity relationships; thus neither mouse nor rat re-

FIGURE 5. Structure-activity relationships for the relaxin family peptides human relaxin-2, human relaxin-3, and insulin-like peptide 3 (INSL 3). The three peptides share common structural features including the two disulfide bonds between the A and B chains and the intrachain disulfide bond in the A chain. In spite of these similarities, all of the peptides bind to their cognate receptors in characteristic ways. Binding of human relaxin-2 to RXFP 1 involves the RxxXRxl/V motif in the B chain (144, 470), and mutations in the A chain can alter activity at both RXFP 1 and RXFP 2 (232, 410); binding of INSL 3 to RXFP 2 involves a similar motif but displaced one turn along the α-helix of the B chain (74–76), whereas NH₂-terminal deletions alter functional responses while retaining binding (74). The human relaxin-3 B chain contains motifs associated with both binding and activity (299, 434), and the A chain can be shortened without affecting activity (232). Similar motifs that occur across peptides probably account for the cross-reactivity seen for some peptides at other RXFP receptors.

laxin can bind to or activate RXFP 2 (454), and human relax-
in-3 has only a poor affinity for RXFP 2 (45).

2. Relaxin-3: structure and function

While relaxin-3 requires both A- and B-chains to bind to and activate RXFP 1, it only requires the B-chain to bind and activate RXFP 3 and RXFP 4 (314) as the B-chain of relaxin-3 is a low-affinity agonist at both receptors (313, 314). Replacement of the human relaxin-3 A-chain with the INSL 5 A-chain (R3/I5) does not influence RXFP 3 binding or activation, but the chimeric peptide displays markedly reduced ability to bind to and activate RXFP 1 (see sect. II.C) (312). Furthermore, truncation of the human relaxin-3 A-

chain produces a peptide that no longer binds to or activates RXFP 1 but retains full activity at RXFP 3 (232).

Mutagenesis of key human relaxin-3 B-chain residues suggests that R8, R16, I15, and F20 are important for human relaxin-3 binding to both RXFP 3 and RXFP 4 (FIGURE 5) (299), whereas R12 is only important for human relaxin-3 binding to RXFP 3 (FIGURE 5) but not to RXFP 4 (299). Additionally, the mutation of R26A and W27A causes a loss of inhibition of forskolin-stimulated CRE activation by the peptide (299), suggesting that these residues are essential for RXFP 3-mediated inhibition of cAMP (FIGURE 5). These mutagenesis studies facilitated the development of a high-affinity RXFP 3 antagonist (ΔR3/I5) that has a truncated human relaxin-3 B-chain (re-

moving R26 and W27), aG23A mutation, and the A-chain of INSL5 (299) to produce a peptide that does not bind to RXFP1. More recently, a single-chain antagonist has been developed that utilizes a modified B-chain of this peptide. This has the B-chain of ΔR3/I5 with the cysteine residues mutated to serine (C10S-C22S) (213).

3. INSL3: structural features associated with specific interaction with RXFP2

INSL3 interacts with RXFP1 only at extremely high concentrations (199, 239), suggesting that it is unlikely to bind to or activate RXFP1 in a physiological setting. Mutagenesis studies on synthetic INSL3 peptides have demonstrated that INSL3 utilizes numerous amino acids in the B-chain to bind to and activate RXFP2. W27 of the INSL3 B-chain is critical for RXFP2 binding and activation (74, 77), although other single amino acid replacements with either alanine or valine throughout the INSL3 B-chain suggested that there were also other important residues for receptor binding in addition to W27 (FIGURE 5). However, while these individual substitutions only slightly reduced the binding of INSL3 to RXFP2, in combination they produce a large effect (75, 435). Thus the combined mutation of H12A, R16A, V19A, R20A, and W27A results in a mutant that cannot bind to RXFP2, highlighting the necessary contribution of all of these residues (FIGURE 5) (435). There have also been a number of INSL3 mutations that have been identified in both normal and patient populations (see sect. VII.B1).

Studies on INSL3 B-chain analogs have suggested that while the B-chain alone can still bind to RXFP2, these single chain peptides cannot activate the receptor and therefore act as functional antagonists (121, 464). A similar effect is produced within the peptide dimer by truncation of the INSL3 A-chain: while deletion of up to six residues has no effect on the full agonist activity of the peptide, deletion of up to 10 residues from the NH₂ terminus of the INSL3 A-chain produces a peptide that still binds to RXFP2, but no longer increases cAMP accumulation (74). These derivatives are specific competitive inhibitors of INSL3 at RXFP2 (74). Similarly, as with the native INSL3 A-chain, deletion of eight NH₂-terminal residues of the B-chain produces an INSL3 peptide that retains binding affinity for RXFP2, but lacks the cAMP signaling function (74). Replacing any of these eight B-chain residues individually with alanine does not affect receptor signaling, nor does replacing all eight residues of the A-chain with alanine (74). Alteration of the cysteine residues of the intra-chain A-chain disulfide bond (C10S/C15S; or C10del/C15del) also produced peptides that retain RXFP2 binding but do not activate cAMP signaling (FIGURE 5) (587). All of these studies highlight that while both the A- and B-chains are necessary for INSL3 activation of RXFP2, the mechanism of action is different from the relaxin-RXFP1 interaction (232).

---

### III. MOLECULAR BIOLOGY, STRUCTURAL FEATURES, AND FUNCTIONAL DOMAINS OF RXFP RECEPTORS

The relaxin family peptide receptors are four highly conserved family A GPCRs that fall into two groups based on their architecture and signaling properties. The RXFP1 and RXFP2 genes have introns, and there are a large number of splice variants many of which result in proteins whose physiological function is yet to be established. In contrast, the genes encoding RXFP3 and RXFP4 are intronless. Both RXFP1 and RXFP2 have a large extracellular NH₂ terminus containing a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain that is responsible for high-affinity ligand binding (this is complemented by a low-affinity binding interaction within exoloop 2) and, uniquely, an LDLa module that is essential for signaling and influences receptor translocation. While RXFP1 and RXFP2 show similarities in ligand binding and signaling, only RXFP1 has a COOH terminus containing motifs that induce the formation of highly sensitive protein signaling complexes termed signalosomes. The third intracellular loop is essential for G protein coupling in all RXFP receptors. RXFP1 and RXFP2 couple to Gαₛ and to GαₒB which modulates this effect, but only RXFP1 is able to couple to Gαᵢ₃ involving R752 in the COOH-terminal tail to produce a delayed surge in cAMP accumulation. On the other hand, RXFP3 and RXFP4 couple solely to Gαᵢ and Gαₒ proteins with the pattern of coupling dependent on the cell type in which the receptor is expressed.

#### A. Molecular Biology of Relaxin Family Peptide Receptors

##### 1. Leucine-rich repeat containing receptors RXFP1 and RXFP2

RXFP1 and RXFP2 are family A G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), similar to the rhodopsin receptor, that specifically belong to the leucine-rich repeat-containing GPCR (LGR) subfamily (reviewed in Ref. 18). Studies of LGRs from different species suggest that the three subtypes of LGRs (A, B, and C) originated during the early evolution of metazoans (241). Generally, LGRs contain a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain, a hinge region, seven transmembrane-spanning domains, and a COOH-terminal tail. Type A LGRs include the FSH receptor, the LH receptor, and the TSH receptor, each of which contains nine LRRs before the hinge region. The type B LGRs consist of three members: LGR4, LGR5, and LGR6. Both LGR4 and LGR5 have 17 LRRs, whereas LGR6 has 13 LRRs. All the receptors from this subgroup have a different hinge region to the type A LGRs. The type C LGRs, RXFP1 (LGR7) and RXFP2 (LGR8), are differentiated by the presence of a LDLa module at the extreme NH₂ terminus, leading into 10 LRRs and a unique hinge region prior to the transmembrane-spanning domain (FIGURE 3).

BATHGATE ET AL.

There is a high degree of conservation within the sequence of RXFP1 and RXFP2 from fish to mammals (240), with human and rodent orthologs exhibiting >90% sequence similarity (238, 239, 455). Human RXFP1 is located on chromosome 4q32.1, and RXFP2 is located on chromosome 13q13.1; the receptors share 60% amino acid sequence identity and 80% homology.

The genes for RXFP1 and RXFP2 are very large, covering >60 kB and both contain 18 exons. Alternative splicing occurs commonly within LGRs, and there are a number of splice variants of all type A LGRs (188, 319, 366, 377, 530), as well as LGR4 and LGR6 (375). To date, 29 splice variants of RXFP1 and RXFP2 have been described resulting in multiple potential protein products including fragments consisting only of the transmembrane or the extracellular region (282, 375, 456). A selection of these variants has been characterized in transfected cell systems, and although some of the transmembrane-containing products translocate to the plasma membrane, others are retained inside the cell. Most of the transmembrane containing variants that are expressed at the cell surface are unable to bind ligand (375). However, an RXFP2 variant that lacks only the exon that encodes the LDLa module is able to bind ligand but does not activate cAMP production, suggesting that this variant may be a native binding protein that could modulate INSL3 action in vivo (456). Products encoding only the extracellular portions of the receptors, including variants that express the LDLa module alone, can be secreted from the cell (456). These variants could therefore act as functional RXFP1 antagonists by binding and preventing relaxin activation of RXFP1. It is postulated that the native variants that are expressed in rodent tissues could act as endogenous antagonists (457). Some of the other splice variants have also been demonstrated to modulate the function of the wild-type receptors. Three RXFP1 splice variants occur in human fetal membranes, and in vitro studies in transfected cells suggest that these variants can form heterodimers with RXFP1 and consequently modulate the function of the receptor (282).

Construction of phylogenetic trees to examine the evolutionary relationship between human RXFP receptors and other family A GPCRs confirms that RXFP1 and RXFP2 are closely related to one another, with 59% sequence identity and 80% similarity based on conservative amino acid changes, and also to the three glycoprotein hormone receptors for thyroid stimulating hormone (TSHR), luteinizing hormone/chorionic gonadotropin (LHCGR), and follicle stimulating hormone (FSHR). RXFP1 and RXFP2 are somewhat less related to the LRR-containing receptors LGR4, LGR5, and LGR6 (22–25% identity, 46–47% similarity) ([FIGURE 2A]). LGR4 and LGR5 have recently been shown to regulate Wnt/β-catenin signaling in response to R-spondins (90). RXFP1 and RXFP2 are also (somewhat surprisingly) related to family A bioamine receptors such as β-adrenoceptors (ARs) and adenosine receptors, as well as additional peptide receptors ([FIGURE 2A]).

RXFP3 and RXFP4 were deorphanized 1 year after RXFP1 and RXFP2 (42, 313–315) and are most closely related to small peptide receptors, with a relatively short NH₂-terminal domain common among family A GPCRs ([FIGURE 2B]). As a consequence of this short NH₂-terminal domain, RXFP3 and RXFP4 are significantly smaller (~400 residues) than RXFP1 and RXFP2 (~700 residues). Human RXFP3 is located on chromosome 5p13.2 and RXFP4 on chromosome 1q22. Unlike RXFP1 and RXFP2, the genes do not contain introns and thus have no splice variants.

RXFP3 and RXFP4 are closely related to one another (43% sequence identity and 60% similarity) and to a subgroup comprising the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AGTR1), the apelin receptor (APLNR) and the chemokine receptor CCR1, and to a second subgroup containing neuropeptide receptors including members of the somatostatin and opioid receptor families and the neuropeptide B/W receptor (NPBWR1) ([FIGURE 2B]). They are also more distantly related to various chemokine receptors (CXCR7, CXCR4, CCR1, and CCR9) and to the formyl peptide receptors FPR2 and FPR3 ([FIGURE 2B]). However, in spite of the close similarity between the cognate ligands for these receptors, the RXFP1/RXFP2 and RXFP3/RXFP4 receptor subgroups are not highly related to each other ([FIGURE 2C]), and in fact, the only significant homology between RXFP1 and RXFP3 is within the highly conserved TM7 motif NSxLNP(I/V)Y that is essential for G protein coupling as well as neighboring key residues in helix 8. RXFP1 and RXFP4 show slightly higher homology, although again the regions of similarity encompass only short motifs in TM3, TM6, and TM7. Instead, both receptor subgroups are related to other family A GPCRs such as the β₂-AR and the adenosine A2B receptor. In essence, these bioamine receptors occupy a bridge between the distinct RXFP1/RXFP2 and RXFP3/RXFP4 subgroups ([FIGURE 2C]). For example, the β₂-AR has homologies with each of the RXFP1 and RXFP3 receptors, with 23% identity/39% similarity to RXFP1 and 21% identity/38% similarity to RXFP3.

B. Structural Features and Mode of Ligand Activation of the LRR-Containing Receptors RXFP1 and RXFP2

1. General features of RXFP1 and RXFP2

The high degree of similarity between RXFP1 and RXFP2 has facilitated the identification of the functional domains of the two receptors. Initial work used relaxin-3 because of its selectivity for RXFP1 over RXFP2, and utilizing chime-

ric receptors revealed that the peptide needs to interact with both the ectodomain and exoloop 2 of the transmembrane domain of RXFP1 in order for the full binding and cAMP signaling profile to be achieved (501). The bimodal interaction of relaxin with RXFP1 was later shown to be a feature of both receptors that both contain two ligand-binding sites: a high-affinity site within the ectodomain and a lower affinity site within the transmembrane region (FIGURE 3) (199). Evidence for two distinct binding sites was also present in functional assays, with the high-affinity ectodomain site inducing cAMP accumulation with higher efficiency than the lower affinity transmembrane site (TABLE 2) (199). Studies with chimeric and truncated receptors showed that both sites are necessary for optimal binding and signal transduction (199). In addition to the LRR-region of the ectodomain, the NH₂-terminal LDLa module is essential for signaling, although to date there is no evidence for a role of this domain in ligand binding (TABLE 2) (231, 280, 456). Thus RXFP1 and RXFP2 have two ligand binding sites, and receptor binding followed by activation is currently thought to require the LRR, extracellular loops, and the LDLa module.

In a manner similar to many other class A GPCRs, recent BRET studies have also shown that both receptors form homo-and heterodimers (282, 510, 511). For RXFP1 and RXFP2, dimerization occurred in the absence, and was independent, of ligand occupation of the receptor (510, 511). Furthermore, dimerization between the haloreceptor and a number of splice variants (encoding only the LDLa module, and up to 8LRR) was evident, and dimers were present at all stages of receptor translocation from the endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane (282), suggesting an important role of dimerization over the lifetime of the receptor. Dimerization was also evident between the haloreceptor and a transmembrane-only domain receptor, although the BRET₂ ratio was decreased compared with that obtained for haloreceptor dimers (510, 511). This suggests that while the transmembrane domain is sufficient for dimerization, the ectodomains play an important role in stabilizing the oligomer.

A functional consequence of dimerization is that both receptors display negative cooperativity (510, 511). In contrast to allosterism, where binding of a molecule to a single site influences the properties of a second site, the two binding sites do not have a fixed affinity in proteins exhibiting negative cooperativity. Instead, the affinity of each remaining unoccupied receptor binding site decreases as occupancy increases. There are two intriguing, functionally relevant consequences of negative cooperativity at RXFP1 and RXFP2: 1) this phenomenon increases the functional range of the ligand over a bigger concentration range, and 2) the ligand residence time at the receptor shortens as the free ligand concentration increases, potentially allowing selective activation of different signaling pathways (476). The negative cooperativity concentration-response curve for

RXFP2 was bell-shaped, suggesting that binding occurs in a trans manner within the dimer: at low concentrations, INSL3 binds to the high-affinity site on receptor 1 and the low-affinity site on receptor 2, with partial ligand dissociation and increased free ligand concentrations; another INSL3 molecule binds in the same manner to the remaining two sites, accelerating the dissociation of the first INSL3 molecule; and finally, at very high concentration of free ligand, this effect is lost due to two additional INSL3 molecules binding to the free high- and low-affinity sites, thus preventing further cross-linking (510). Contrastingly, the negative cooperativity concentration-response curve for relaxin binding to RXFP1 was linear, although the absence of a protein structure precludes conclusions regarding the functional consequences of this observation (511).

2. A unique feature of RXFP1 and RXFP2: the LDLa module

The LDLa module was originally defined by the structure of the LDL receptor (110, 571) but has since been identified in a number of other proteins including the very-low-density lipoprotein receptor (177), the LDL receptor-related protein (218), renal glycoprotein gp330 (223, 326), the C9 component of complement (123, 494), the Tva receptor for Rous sarcoma virus (39), and retina-and brain-specific neuropilin, and tolloid-like protein 1 transmembrane protein (500). RXFP1 and RXFP2 are the only known human GPCRs to contain this module (42). The NMR solution structure of the RXFP1 LDLa module was recently solved (FIGURE 3) and shows the typical fold generated by the essential six cysteine residues, and the anticipated incorporation of a calcium ion by a largely conserved motif of acidic residues (231).

Mutagenesis studies of the LDLa region have highlighted the essential role of this module in receptor signaling. Mutation of conserved residues, those that compromised correct folding, or indeed entire deletion of the LDLa module of either RXFP1 or RXFP2 resulted in receptors that when occupied are unable to increase cAMP, despite these mutant receptors maintaining intact ligand binding profiles (231, 280, 456). Mutation of two conserved cysteines (C47A and C53A), or mutation of a residue within the calcium-binding motif (D58E), resulted in mutant RXFP1 receptors that were unable to increase cAMP accumulation in response to either human relaxin-1 or human relaxin-2 (280). Other mutations that affect the ability of the LDLa module to correctly fold (C5S and C18S, which disrupts the first disulphide bond) also results in a receptor that is unable to increase cAMP accumulation (TABLE 2) (231). Additionally, when the RXFP1 LDLa module is swapped for the LDLa module contained within the second ligand-binding domain of the LDL receptor, the chimeric receptor was unable to increase cAMP accumulation in response to human relaxin-2 but bound ligand normally (231). These data together with further mutagenesis of specific residues in the RXFP1 LDLa module indicate that this

RELAXIN FAMILY PEPTIDES AND THEIR RECEPTORS

ing the LH receptor (18, 419, 520) and the FSH receptor (115, 428) and is suggested to be a form of control over cell surface expression. Interestingly, RXFP1 lacking an LDLa module was expressed as the mature form, as was a chimeric RXFP1 receptor containing the LDLa module of RXFP2 (280). Furthermore, mutation of a conserved glycosylation site within the LDLa module results in a receptor with a reduced ability to generate cAMP, which was attributable to a decrease in cell surface expression (280, 572). In RXFP2, mutations of amino acid residues that form the disulfide bond or coordinate Ca²⁺ binding in the LDLa module (C71Y and D70Y) also reduced cell surface expression (64). Taken together, this suggests that the LDLa module may impair, or negatively regulate, receptor expression at the plasma membrane.

3. The LRR region and its importance for receptor translocation, ligand binding, and signal transduction

Glycosylation is a posttranslational modification common to many GPCRs and is important for receptor delivery to the cell surface, ligand binding, and signal transduction. In addition to the glycosylation sites within the LDLa module, RXFP1 contains a number of glycosylation sites within the LRRs (asparagines at N105, N250, N303, and N346) that are all important for both cell-surface localization of the receptor and full cAMP signaling efficacy, but have no role in ligand binding (572). As yet, the glycosylation status of RXFP2 has not been studied in detail.

Both RXFP1 and RXFP2 contain two peptide-binding sites: a high-affinity site in the LRR region and a lower-affinity site in the extracellular loop region (TABLE 2) (199, 501). Modeling of the LRR region of RXFP1 based on the crystal structure of the porcine ribonuclease inhibitor (a protein with LRRs) allowed in silico peptide docking and targeted receptor mutagenesis (78). These studies revealed that the site most likely to bind relaxin occurs at a 45° angle across five of the parallel LRRs (78). Relaxin binding to these LRRs occurs through synchronized chelation of two arginines in the relaxin B-chain (R13 and R17: part of the relaxin binding motif), neutralization of charge from acidic groups within the concave face of the LRRs (E277 and D279 in LRR8, and D231 and E233 in LRR6), and generation of hydrogen bonding (78). This is stabilized by a hydrophobic interaction between the relaxin B-chain isoleucine (I20) and a receptor-based cluster of W180 and I182 within LRR4, and L204 and V206 within LRR5 (78). Deletion of any of these residues within the receptor abolished relaxin binding (78). Although these residues are also present on RXFP2, evidence suggests that human relaxin-2 binds to RXFP2 in an INSL3-like manner (458).

As outlined in section IIC, INSL3 utilizes different residues in the B-chain to interact with RXFP2 compared with the relaxin-RXFP1 interaction (TABLE 3). However, human relaxin-2 contains most of these residues and can mimic the INSL3 interaction. By using the NMR solution structure of INSL3, and molecular modeling of the RXFP2 LRR based on the crystal structure of the NoGo receptor (47% amino acid sequence homology), a recent study identifies the RXFP2 residues that directly interact with the INSL3 B-chain (459). With the use of targeted mutagenesis of both peptide and receptor, in conjunction with in silico docking of the INSL3 B-chain to the LRR of RXFP2, seven residues within RXFP2 were identified. Thus within the B-chain of INSL3, residue R16 is predicted to interact with RXFP2 D227, INSL3 H12 with RXFP2 W177, INSL3 V19 with RXFP2 I179, INSL3 R20 with RXFP2 E229 and D181, and INSL3 W27 with RXFP2 F131 and Q133 (459). The primary determinants of INSL3 binding are the peptide residues R20 and W27 within the B-chain. Although five of the identified RXFP2 residues are conserved in RXFP1, the two non-conserved residues (D181 and F131) interact with essential residues within the INSL3 binding motif: R20 and W27 (459). Thus this model potentially provides an explanation for the lack of INSL3 binding at RXFP1.

4. Evidence for low-affinity relaxin family peptide binding to extracellular loops in RXFP1 and RXFP2

In addition to the relatively well-defined high-affinity ligand-binding site within the LRRs, both RXFP1 and RXFP2 have an additional lower affinity binding site presumed to be within the transmembrane exoloops of the receptors. The existence of this site was first suggested by a study that utilized chimeric receptors, which exploited the inability of relaxin-3 to either bind to or activate RXFP2 (501). The binding affinity and cAMP signaling efficacy of relaxin-3 was reduced at an RXFP1/2 chimera (RXFP1 ectodomain, fused to the transmembrane and COOH terminus of RXFP2) compared with RXFP1. However, replacement of the second extracellular loop (ECL2) of RXFP2 with that of RXFP1 restored relaxin-3 binding and signaling, thereby identifying ECL2 as a secondary binding site (TABLE 3).

This additional low-affinity site has since been confirmed for other relaxin peptides at both RXFP1 and RXFP2. These studies used the same chimeric receptors described above and exploited the preference of rat relaxin for RXFP1 over RXFP2, and the preference of INSL3 for RXFP2 over RXFP1 (199). Thus primary binding is directed by the ectodomain, with an influence of the low-affinity site within the transmembrane ECLs. This mechanism is also reflected in cAMP signaling efficacy profiles; thus the high-affinity site signals to cAMP accumulation with high efficiency, and the low-affinity site with low efficiency. The precise location of the sites has yet to be determined, although it is presumed to be within the ECLs and may involve an interaction with the A-chain of the relaxin family peptides (TABLE 3).

requires R752 within these residues (FIGURE 3), as truncation of the COOH terminus or substitution of R752 selectively removes coupling to the $G_{\alpha_{i3}}$ pathway (TABLE 2) (204). As yet, the precise mechanism by which the terminal 10 residues of RXFP1 direct $G_{\alpha_{i3}}$ coupling is unclear. There are a number of possibilities including direct $G_{\alpha_{i3}}$ coupling, $G_{\alpha_{i3}}$ coupling induced by receptor phosphorylation, or recruitment of scaffolding proteins for colocalization of the receptor with $G_{\alpha_{i3}}$. However, it would be unprecedented for G protein coupling to occur directly with the RXFP1 COOH-terminal tail.

The COOH-terminal tail of RXFP1 also controls a small degree of constitutive activity (201) and only RXFP1, but not RXFP2, constitutively couples to AC2 by an association between helix 8 and A-kinase anchoring protein 79 (AKAP79). This protein complex also facilitates $G_{\alpha_s}$ and $G\beta\gamma$-mediated stimulation of AC2 to increase cAMP accumulation in response to subpicomolar concentrations of relaxin (see sect.VIA). The level of cAMP generated by this complex is tightly controlled by the activity of protein kinase A(PKA)-stimulated phosphodiesterase (PDE) 4D3, which is localized to the receptor COOH terminus by an association between $\beta$-arrestin 2 and S704 of RXFP1. This signalosome, directed and maintained by the RXFP1 COOH-terminal tail, mediates a cAMP response to low concentrations of peptide and may provide a novel cellular response to low levels of relaxin in some physiological situations.

The RXFP1 COOH-terminal tail also contains a number of potential consensus sequences for phosphorylation and protein-protein interactions and is the region of most variation between RXFP1 and the highly related RXFP2 (203), thus representing an area of functional divergence between the two receptors which may relate to the more varied physiological roles of relaxin in relation to INSL3.

C. The Mode of Ligand Activation of the Small Peptide Receptor-like Receptors RXFP3 and RXFP4

As noted previously, the small NH$_2$-terminal domains of RXFP3 and RXFP4 are markedly different from RXFP1 and RXFP2. The precise mode by which relaxin-3 and INSL5 bind to and activate their receptors is currently unknown. However, current evidence suggests that the B-chain of relaxin-3 contains all the RXFP3 contact points. It is postulated that the residues in the B-chain central helix R8, R16, I15, and F20 that are important for human relaxin-3 binding may interact with the RXFP3 ECLs or NH$_2$-terminal domain, whereas residues R26 and W27, which are essential for receptor activation, may interact with the RXFP3 transmembrane helices (291, 594). The precise residues in both RXFP3 and RXFP4 that interact with these amino acids are currently unclear, although one

study has extensively examined the potential roles of the extracellular domains and transmembrane helices in receptor function (TABLE 4) (594). This study examined the binding and activation of RXFP3 and RXFP4 chimeras by INSL5 and human relaxin-3 to determine regions of the receptor necessary for ligand interaction. A chimera of RXFP3 (transmembrane domain, loops, and COOH-terminal tail) with the NH$_2$-terminal region of RXFP4 (CR1) showed increased affinity for INSL5 compared with RXFP3 but no increase in GTP$\gamma$S binding and little change in ${}^{125}\mathrm{I} \mathrm{R} 3 / \mathrm{I} 5$ binding. The reverse chimera, consisting of RXFP4 (transmembrane domains, loops and COOH-terminal tail) and the NH$_2$-terminal region of RXFP3 (CR13), had similar affinity to the wild-type RXFP4 receptor for human relaxin-3, but lower affinity for INSL5 (594), suggesting that the NH$_2$ terminus of RXFP4 is important for INSL5 and possibly human relaxin-3 binding (TABLE 4).

The roles of the ECLs of RXFP3 were also investigated using RXFP3 and RXFP4 chimeras. Chimeras of RXFP3, with ECL1 or ECL3 replaced with the corresponding loops of RXFP4, produced receptors that behaved essentially like the RXFP3 wild-type receptor, suggesting that ECL1 and ECL3 were not important in INSL5 binding to either RXFP3 or RXFP4 (594). Receptors consisting of RXFP3 with the ECL2 of RXFP4 (CR3) had higher affinity for INSL5, and a slightly lower affinity for human relaxin-3, compared with RXFP3, similar to the findings with CR1 (594). The potency of human relaxin-3 at CR3 was unchanged, whereas the potency of INSL5 was increased (594). Receptors consisting of RXFP4 with the ECL2 of RXFP3 (CR14) had similar affinity for human relaxin-3, but lower affinity for INSL5 (594), suggesting that ECL2 was important for INSL5 binding to RXFP4. Functionally, CR14 behaved similarly to CR13, showing a slight decrease in the potency of human relaxin-3 and a larger decrease in the potency of INSL5 (594), suggesting that the ECL2 of RXFP3 and RXFP4 are important for ligand binding and may also have a role in activation (TABLE 4).

Replacement of both the NH$_2$ terminus and ECL2 of RXFP3 with the NH$_2$-terminal region and ECL2 of RXFP4 produced a chimeric receptor (CR5) that bound human relaxin-3 and INSL5 in a similar manner to wild-type RXFP4 (594), suggesting that both the ECL2 and the NH$_2$-terminal region of RXFP4 are important for INSL5 binding. However, stimulation of chimeric CR5 with INSL5 does not increase GTP$\gamma$S binding, suggesting that the NH$_2$ terminus and ECL2 of RXFP4 (though important for binding) are not sufficient for receptor activation (TABLE 4). The reverse receptor, consisting of RXFP4 with the NH$_2$-terminal region and ECL2 replaced with the equivalent regions of RXFP3 (CR15), had a reduced affinity for INSL5 but no change in the affinity

RELAXIN FAMILY PEPTIDES AND THEIR RECEPTORS

IV. EXPRESSION AND SECRETION OF RELAXIN FAMILY PEPTIDES IN HUMANS AND OTHER SPECIES

A. Production and Secretion of Relaxin in Mammals

Although relaxin was originally discovered on the basis of its actions on the pregnant female reproductive tract in lower species, it is clear that it also has additional roles in a wide variety of tissues in the nonpregnant female and the male. Thus, in those species where it has been examined, relaxin is found and acts as a neuropeptide in brain and is expressed in peripheral tissues such as heart, kidney, lung, liver, and pancreas (FIGURE 4). In reproductive tissues, relaxin expression is found in the corpus luteum, uterus, mammary gland, testis, and prostate. Whereas the general distribution of relaxin in nonpregnant mammals points to autocrine or paracrine functions, in pregnancy relaxin is secreted in large amounts and has endocrine functions. The source of this relaxin varies but can be the corpus luteum, uterus, or placenta or combinations of these depending on the species. The actions of relaxin during pregnancy are also quite variable across species but are generally related to its plasma secretion profile; thus in some species where levels are high in late pregnancy it plays an important role in modifying the reproductive tract in readiness for parturition, whereas in others where the plasma profile is different, such as humans, its role is less clear.

The following sections outline the known sources of relaxin in various species. We have not attempted to compare the relative expression of relaxin in different tissues due to the variety of techniques that have been used to determine the sites of expression. It should be noted that on occasion only one technique was used to demonstrate tissue expression, and in addition, the antibodies utilized were not always characterized for cross-reactivity between different relaxin family peptides. Therefore, some of these data may need to be confirmed using independent techniques.

1. Detection of relaxin mRNA and protein in human reproductive tissues

In nonpregnant women, human relaxin-2 mRNA expression in the ovary has been identified by Northern blotting, RT-PCR, and Southern blotting (191, 246, 258). It is likely that ovarian relaxin is produced in the corpus luteum since human relaxin-2 is found in luteal extracts (391), luteal cyst fluid (321), and in bathing fluid from dispersed corpora lutea (451). Relaxin expression examined using immunohistochemistry reveals expression in the corpus luteum (579), specifically to luteal cells (351), granulosa cells of luteinized follicles (577), and cells from the luteinized theca interna of developing follicles (61). In women, there is good evidence that this relaxin is released into the circulation

during the menstrual cycle, since a small peak of relaxin immunoreactivity occurs in the plasma 9–10 days following ovulation (497).

Relaxin is also expressed in the secretory endometrium (578, 579), and the glandular and luminal epithelia and decidualized stromal cells of the endometrium (71). Relaxin mRNA expression has been detected by RT-PCR in glandular epithelial and stromal cells from cultures of human endometrium (409). Both human relaxin-1 and human relaxin-2 mRNA were found by RT-PCR and qRT-PCR in the uterus during the menstrual phase of the cycle (67).

In human pregnancy, the corpus luteum is the major source of immunoreactive circulating relaxin (336, 391, 392). The levels peak in the first trimester, and ovarian venous blood levels are three to four times higher at 6 wk gestation than in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle (283). The circulating relaxin from the corpus luteum is human relaxin-2. The corpus luteum contains human relaxin-2 mRNA (258), and human relaxin-2 has been isolated from plasma of pregnant women (324, 566, 567). Consistent with this being the major source of relaxin in pregnancy, in women with ovarian failure and those lacking corpora lutea who become pregnant by in vitro fertilization, circulating levels of relaxin are undetectable (148, 269). Comparison of the pattern of relaxin secretion in human pregnancy with that in other species reveals major differences. In pregnant women, relaxin levels peak in early pregnancy at fairly modest levels but then fall, whereas in other mammals such as pigs, rats, and mice relaxin levels are much higher and rise throughout pregnancy, falling just prior to parturition (47).

During pregnancy there is also expression of relaxin in the placenta (191), with Northern blotting detecting relaxin mRNA in the amnion, chorion, decidua parietalis, basal plate, and placental trophoblast (439). Relaxin immunoreactivity was found in the amnion (70, 287, 439), chorion (70, 287, 439), decidua (287, 579) (70, 439), basal plate (166) (287, 439), and placental trophoblast (439, 579). Relaxin has also been purified from the placenta (166, 570).

In other tissues, such as breast tissue, relaxin mRNA was detected by RT-PCR and subsequent Southern analysis, with increased expression in neoplastic samples (522). Relaxin immunoreactivity is present in lobular and ductal epithelium and myoepithelium of the normal and neoplastic breast, with secretion detected from metaplastic epithelium (355). The peptide is also present in milk (141).

In the male, similar approaches have identified human relaxin-1 and human relaxin-2 mRNA (191, 258) and relaxin immunoreactivity in the prostate (489), specifically within the glandular epithelium of the prostate, the glandular epithelium of the seminal vesicles and the ampulla of the vas
deferens (576), and immunoreactive human relaxin-2 is also secreted into seminal plasma (117, 320, 557, 567).

### 2. Detection of relaxin mRNA and protein in other mammalian reproductive tissues

In rats and mice, as in humans, the corpus luteum is a major source of relaxin particularly during pregnancy, but there the resemblance ends. In ovaries from nonpregnant animals, relaxin mRNA (46, 80, 108, 190, 244) and protein levels (473) are relatively low. Specifically, relaxin immunoreactivity is localized to the luteal cells of the ovary (14). These levels increase at estrus (108) and in pseudopregnant rats (473), but major increases only occur with pregnancy (14, 472, 473). Unlike humans, rats and mice display a marked increase in relaxin levels which peak just before birth and then return to low levels post-partum (47).

In the nonpregnant mouse, relaxin mRNA expression has been detected by Southern blotting of RT-PCR products in the testis, epididymis, prostate, mammary gland, endometrium, and myometrium (46). Similarly in the rat, relaxin mRNA expression has been detected by RT-PCR and Northern blot analysis in the placenta, uterus, mammary gland, testis, and prostate (190).

The source and function of relaxin in reproductive tissues from other mammalian species have been described in detail elsewhere (47). However, irrespective of the source, relaxin levels are greatly increased during pregnancy in all mammals that have been studied. In pigs, as in rats and mice, the corpus luteum is the main source of relaxin in pregnancy, but in the horse, rabbit, hamster, cat, and dog, the placenta appears to be the main site of synthesis (see Ref. 47 for details). The guinea pig is unusual in that the uterus is the main site of relaxin production during pregnancy (47).

### 3. Relaxin as a neuropeptide in the CNS

There are no studies to date detailing expression of relaxin within human brain. However, in the rat, relaxin mRNA expression in the brain has been detected by RT-PCR (190) and Northern blotting (402). Specific localization of the peptide was also determined by in situ hybridization histochemistry in anterior olfactory nuclei, taenia tecta, and piriform cortex (81, 333, 402), the orbital cortex (333, 402), the fields CA1–2 of Ammon's horn, the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and the neocortex (402), and the anterior cingulated cortex and the arcuate nucleus (333) **(FIGURE 6)**. Immunohistochemistry has identified relaxin expression in the cytoplasm and proximal processes of cell bodies in the arcuate nucleus, anterior olfactory nucleus, taenia tecta, and piriform cortex (333). In the mouse, relaxin expression has been detected by Southern blotting of RT-PCR products in the cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus, thalamus, pons/medulla, and cerebellum (46). Broadly the distribu-

tion of expression of relaxin in mouse brain resembles that of the rat (306).

### 4. Distribution of relaxin in other tissues

In the human, relaxin has been detected in the circulation using ELISA (497) and radioimmunoassay (141, 269, 391, 393, 426, 498) techniques. Cultures of human luteinizing granulosa cells also secrete relaxin, as determined using an immunoassay (499). In mice, relaxin expression has been detected by Southern blotting of RT-PCR products in the thymus, heart, and kidney, with lower levels in the lung, spleen, and skin (46). RT-PCR identified relaxin expression specifically in the medulla and cortex of the kidney (445), and in the atria and ventricles of the heart (136). Radioimmunoassay identified relaxin in the peripheral circulation in pregnant mice (393). Distribution of relaxin expression in the rat is similar to mice, with mRNA demonstrated by RT-PCR in the kidney, heart, liver, and pancreas (190). Radioimmunoassay has identified relaxin in the peripheral circulation of pregnant rats (393, 472), and a reverse hemolytic plaque assay detected relaxin that was secreted from cultured atrial cardiomyocytes from neonatal rats (524). In some instances, only relaxin-3 but not relaxin expression was identified in the heart by RT-PCR (290, 443).

#### B. Production and Secretion of INSL3 in Mammals

INSL3 expression occurs mainly in the reproductive system in mammals with the highest expression in the testis. However, INSL3 is expressed at equivalent levels in the ruminant ovary and has an expression pattern during pregnancy that is similar to relaxin (40, 41, 432). As ruminants lack a relaxin gene (563), it has been postulated that INSL3 may act in lieu of relaxin in bovine and ovine species (48). As the expression of INSL3 in all mammalian species has been covered in detail elsewhere (47), this section will focus in INSL3 in humans and rodents.

#### 1. Detection of INSL3 mRNA and protein in the mammalian reproductive system

INSL3 mRNA is highly expressed in the testis of every mammalian species so far examined. In humans, INSL3 mRNA has been identified in the testis by Northern blot analysis (2, 84), RT-PCR (254), and Western blotting (227). Expression of INSL3 has been specifically localized to the Leydig cells using in situ hybridization (254, 285) and immunohistochemistry (24, 285) **(FIGURE 4, TABLE 1)**. INSL3 has also been detected by immunoassay in human serum (8, 11, 50, 72, 172, 173), with higher levels in males compared with females correlating with the high expression in the Leydig cells of the testis. In the male, INSL3 levels in the peripheral circulation decline with age (11). Immunoassay has also identified INSL3 expression in the amniotic

fluid of male, but not female, fetuses (10) suggesting that INSL3 is expressed in fetal testis as has been demonstrated in other mammals (47) which also correlates with its role in testis descent (see sect. VII B). INSL3 mRNA and protein are also expressed in the prostate, with strong expression in the basal epithelium (286). In the female, INSL3 is expressed in the ovary, specifically within the corpus luteum as determined by RT-PCR (521), Northern blotting (521), and immunohistochemistry (24), in addition to expression in the trophoblast of the ovary determined using RT-PCR (521) and the theca interna cells using immunohistochemistry (24). Both in situ hybridization and immunostaining have identified INSL3 expression in the endometrium, specifically within the epithelial cells, endometrial gland cells, and stromal cells (230). The peptide is expressed in human breast tissue, determined using RT-PCR, with in situ hy-

bridization showing localization of INSL3 to the tubuloaveolar and ductal epithelium (227). INSL3 expression has also been detected in placental tissue using Western blotting (227, 230), with specific expression in the trophoblasts of anchoring villi and fetal membranes, maternal blood vessels, and the basal plate identified using in situ hybridization and immunostaining (230).

In the mouse and the rat, INSL3 is expressed in the testis as determined by Northern blotting (23, 412, 491, 595) and RT-PCR (23, 276), with specific expression within the Leydig cells recorded using Northern blotting (424), in situ hybridization (23, 412, 424, 525), and immunohistochemistry (23, 184, 412). Levels of INSL3 mRNA are highest in the fetal testis shortly before birth, after which they decrease until puberty when they again rise.

In the rat, INSL3 has been identified in the circulation of the male using immunoassay but levels in the female are very low (9, 68). Plasma levels in rats are correlated with mRNA levels being highest just before birth and during adulthood (9, 68) and decline with age as in humans (9). There is also evidence for the transport of INSL3 across the blood-testis barrier into the germinal compartment (9). In the mouse, INSL3 levels in the blood are also much higher in males than females (9). INSL3 protein expression has also been demonstrated in the seminiferous tubules of the (9) mouse using immunohistochemistry (23). RT-PCR has detected expression of INSL3 mRNA in the epididymis (23), prostate (23), and the posterior part of male embryos (595). In the female mouse and rat, INSL3 mRNA was detected in the ovary using Northern blotting (491, 595) and RT-PCR (23, 276), with specific expression in the mouse in the corpus luteum and stromal cells determined using immunohistochemistry (23). In addition, in the rat, the use of RT-PCR shows specific expression in the thecal cells surrounding preovulatory follicles (276).

### 2. Is INSL3 a neuropeptide?

Despite evidence for the expression of the INSL3 receptor, RXFP2, in brain, no studies have identified INSL3 expression in the CNS of rodents or humans (189, 469). Circulating levels of INSL3 could potentially affect some areas of the brain such as the pituitary, hypothalamus, and areas of the brain stem, although this remains to be demonstrated (86).

### 3. Detection of INSL3 in other peripheral tissues

There is limited evidence for the expression of INSL3 in nonreproductive tissues. In humans, INSL3 expression, as determined using in situ hybridization, is upregulated in the neoplastic thyroid gland (228).

C. The Location and Release of Relaxin-3 in Mammals

#### 1. Identification of relaxin-3 in brain

In contrast to the widespread expression of relaxin and INSL3, studies that have mapped the specific distribution of relaxin-3 and RXFP3 expression have provided valuable insights into the physiological functions of this ligand-receptor pair. Relaxin-3 expression measured by Southern blotting of RT-PCR products from mouse tissue (46) showed relaxin-3 mRNA in abundance in the brain **(FIGURE 6)**; at moderate levels in the thymus, kidney, and spleen; and at low levels in the heart and liver, with no noticeable gender differences. Northern blots and in situ hybridization studies showed that relaxin-3 is localized to cells of the pars ventromedialis of the dorsal tegmental nucleus (46). The expression of rat relaxin-3 was subsequently found to mirror that of the mouse homolog **(FIGURE 6)** (80). Similarly, relaxin-3 expression is highest in the human brain, although substantial expression is also found in the testis, where its role remains to be demonstrated (314). The high levels of relaxin-3 expression in the brain of numerous species have led to a focus on the role of the peptide in the CNS.

Most neuroanatomical studies have been conducted in rodents, and in rat brain, the distribution of relaxin-3 has been characterized with two different antibodies (329, 516). It is expressed in the nucleus incertus (NI), located in the median dorsal pons and also referred to as the dorsal tegmental nucleus pars ventromedialis (373), nucleus recessus pontismedialis (261), or nucleus “O” (413). Neurons expressing relaxin-3 are also present in the pontine raphe nucleus; the anterior, lateral, and ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (PAG); and in an area dorsal to the lateral substantia nigra **(FIGURE 6)** (329). As in the rat, the primary source of relaxin-3 in the mouse brain is the NI, with some relaxin-3-positive neurons also located in the pontine central gray and adjacent to the fourth ventricle (487). Discrete populations of relaxin-3-containing neurons were also observed in the pontine raphe nucleus, anterior periaqueductal gray, and a region dorsal to the substantia nigra and medial to the peripeduncular nucleus. A recent study of sites of relaxin-3 expression in zebrafish has revealed expression patterns similar to those observed in rodents (125). Relaxin-3 expression occurs in neurons located near the fourth ventricle and in the periaqueductal gray (confirmed by colocalization with proenkephalin-like gene 1). In the macaque (*Macaca fascicularis*) brain, relaxin-3 is expressed in areas similar to the NI in rodents (332). In the rhesus macaque (*Macaca mulatta*), using a different antibody, there was a similar pattern of expression (478). This consistent, specific and restricted expression of relaxin-3 in multiple species suggests that relaxin-3 has quite conserved and thus important functions in the brain.
RELAXIN FAMILY PEPTIDES AND THEIR RECEPTORS

The target nuclei of the neuronal projections from relaxin-3-expressing cell bodies provide further insights into relaxin-3 function. The projections of NI neurons in the rat brain have been extensively mapped (187, 395). Ascending projections from the NI connect to the raphe, mammillary complex, hippocampus, cortex, amygdala, habenula, medial septum, and hypothalamus (FIGURE 6). Overall, the NI appears to have strong reciprocal connections with the median raphe and the interpeduncular nuclei. The NI appears to have important roles in behavioral arousal (187, 395).

D. Distribution of Other Relaxin Family Peptides in Mammals

INSL4 is highly expressed in the placenta, and RT-PCR analysis suggests that it is most highly expressed in the human placenta during the first trimester of pregnancy (94). No INSL4 transcripts were identified in human ovary, prostate, testis, brain, skin, esophagus, adrenal, breast, kidney, thyroid, stomach, liver, colon, rectum, omentum, or spleen. Immunoreactive INSL4 is detected in the plasma and amniotic fluid during pregnancy, with higher amniotic fluid levels found in abnormal pregnancies (such as trisomy 21), suggesting that INSL4 may be a marker of chromosomal abnormalities during pregnancy (368, 369).

The INSL5 gene was identified from colon EST libraries, and the highest expression of INSL5 mRNA is in the colon in mice and human (100). INSL5 mRNA is also expressed in the kidney, thymus, heart ovary, and brain (FIGURE 4), although there are some differences in tissue expression between the mice and humans, with mRNA also detected in human uterus, placenta, prostate, spleen and bone marrow, and in mouse testis (100, 236, 315). Relatively little is known about the distribution of INSL5 protein. In the kidney, INSL5 appears to be located in the cytoplasm of a subset of epithelial cells in the loop of Henle (236). In the mouse brain, putative INSL5 immunoreactive cells are located in the paraventricular, supraoptic, accessory secretory and supraoptic retrochiasmatic nucleus throughout the rostrocaudal extent of the hypothalamus and pituitary (137). In contrast, another study showed a lack of INSL5 mRNA expression in the mouse brain (507).

INSL6 mRNA was identified by Northern blotting only in the testis of human tissues and not in heart, brain, placenta, lung, liver, skeletal muscle, kidney, pancreas, spinal cord, lymph node, trachea, adrenal gland, or bone marrow (317). The distribution of rat INSL6 mRNA was similar as determined by Northern blotting, with mRNA identified in the testis and prostate of rat tissues (317). In situ hybridization of rat and Rhesus macaque tissues identified INSL6 mRNA in the spermatocytes and round spermatids in the seminiferous tubules but not in the Leydig cells (317). Studies in mice have also demonstrated that INSL6 is expressed in meiotic and postmeiotic germ cells correlating with the

marked reduction in sperm numbers and motility in INSL6 knockout mice (85). A recent study has demonstrated that INSL6 is expressed in skeletal muscle in mice and may function as a myogenic regenerative factor (584).

V. LOCALIZATION OF RELAXIN FAMILY PEPTIDE RECEPTOR MRNA AND PROTEIN IN MAMMALIAN TISSUES

The tissue distribution of receptors for relaxin family peptides has been determined by their mRNA expression patterns using RT-PCR, Northern blotting, or in situ hybridization or by protein expression using immunohistochemistry or receptor autoradiography (FIGURE 6; TABLE 1). The expression patterns of all the receptors generally match their identified roles as cognate receptors for their respective ligands. There is much information regarding RXFP1 expression, both in terms of the variety of approaches used and the tissues examined (TABLE 1), with receptor expression being identified in both female and male reproductive tissues, the brain and numerous nonreproductive tissues such as the kidney, heart, and lung. Less information is available for RXFP2, RXFP3, and RXFP4, although more detailed evidence is now emerging for RXFP3 expression in the brain, suggesting that this receptor may have promise as a therapeutic target (see sect. VIIIC).

A. The Tissue Distribution of RXFP1: the Receptor for Relaxin

1. Reproductive tissues

Prior to the discovery of RXFP1, localization of the unknown relaxin receptor was determined by monitoring the binding of labeled relaxin peptides to various tissues. In this manner, early studies demonstrated relaxin binding in homogenates of mouse pubic symphysis and uterine tissue, rat mammary gland and guinea pig pubic symphysis and cervix (TABLE 1) (363). Other autoradiographic studies utilised a relaxin variant (B33 relaxin, which facilitates peptide labeling with ³²P or ³³P) to identify relaxin binding in rat uterus (401, 403, 515). Following receptor deorphanization, RXFP1 distribution was identified using immunohistochemistry in both myometrial and epithelial cells of the rat uterus (239). In humans, RXFP1 has been identified by binding and immunohistochemistry in luminal and glandular epithelial cells, myometrium, blood vessels, and stromal extracellular matrix (TABLE 1) (288). Similar localization has been reported using ³³P relaxin (67) or immunohistochemistry (297, 325). Other immunohistochemical studies for RXFP1 have reported binding solely to endometrial stromal cells in humans but also to glandular epithelial cells of the marmoset endometrium (255). There is some evidence to suggest that RXFP1 expression in the human endometrium varies with the menstrual cycle. Autoradiogra

Physiol Rev · VOL 93 · JANUARY 2013 · www.prv.org 429
phy was used to localize specific relaxin binding to human uterus and showed binding to the glandular epithelium and endometrial luminal epithelium. Both binding and RXFP1 mRNA levels increased markedly in the early secretory phase of the menstrual cycle compared with the proliferative phases (67). Weaker binding occurred in endometrial stromal tissue and little in myometrium (67). Immunohistochemical studies are more equivocal with either broad agreement (297) with binding studies or evidence for more intense staining during the proliferative phase of the cycle in studies with a high degree of variability (325).

In human breast tissue, RXFP1 was detected in the stromal mesenchyme adjacent to the glandular epithelia and in epithelial-derived cells in some breast tumors (255). Cultured slices of ovarian cortical tissue displayed RXFP1 mRNA and protein in flat follicular cells of primordial follicles and granulosa cells of primary and secondary follicles (474).

The distribution of RXFP1 in rodent reproductive tissues is similar to that in humans. RXFP1 mRNA has been detected by RT-PCR in the mouse uterus and testis (274). Incorporation of the LacZ reporter gene into the RXFP1 knockout mouse allowed receptor expression to be demonstrated near the spermatids and in the Leydig cells of the testis, the prostate, the nipple, the circular layer of the myometrium, the lamina propria under the luminal epithelium and the longitudinal layer of the myometrium, the basal layer of the vaginal epithelium and vaginal smooth muscle cells, as well as vascular supporting tissue and vascular epithelium of the oviduct (293). In rats, antibodies directed against the ectodomain of RXFP1 identified receptor protein in the myometrial and the epithelial layer of the endometrium of the uterus, the muscularis layer of the vagina, and the myometrial layer of the cervix (239). RXFP1 has also been detected in rat nipple and mammary gland (300).

### 2. RXFP1 receptors in the CNS

RXFP1 receptors identified by receptor autoradiography are widely distributed in the brain localized to discrete regions of the olfactory system, neocortex, hypothalamus, hippocampus, thalamus, amygdala, midbrain, and medulla (400, 404, 515) ([FIGURE 6](#figure-6)). High levels of RXFP1 binding in the subfornical organ (SFO), organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis (OVLT), and the paraventricular and supraoptic hypothalamic nuclei (400, 404, 515) provide the anatomical and biochemical basis for the control of plasma osmolality by relaxin (361, 362, 483, 504, 505). RXFP1 mRNA has also been demonstrated in rat brain by Northern blotting (237, 455) and by RT-PCR (167, 290, 298, 443), in mouse brain using a reporter gene approach (293) and by Northern blotting (455), and in human brain using RT-PCR (239).

### 3. Localization of RXFP1 in the cardiovascular and renal systems

The important roles of relaxin in the cardiovascular adaptive changes associated with pregnancy are reflected in the presence of RXFP1 mRNA in the rat (237) and human kidney (239). In rodents, the heart is also clearly influenced by relaxin. Atria of both male and female rats contain a high density of relaxin binding sites (401, 402, 515), and RXFP1 mRNA has been detected in the rat (237, 290) and mouse (293) heart. However, lower levels of RXFP1 mRNA have also been detected in the human heart ([TABLE 1](#table-1)) (239). More recent studies using Western blotting show RXFP1 expression in left atrium but not left ventricle in both failing and nonfailing human heart (127). Relaxin is a potent chronotropic and inotropic agent in the rat heart (271, 290, 417, 418) and also has inotropic effects on the human heart (127) (see sect. VIIA). It produces its effects by acting directly on RXFP1 receptors located mainly in the atria.

### B. Tissue Distribution of RXFP2: the Receptor for INSL3

#### 1. Localization of RXFP2 in reproductive tissues

Although fewer studies have examined the localization of RXFP2 compared with RXFP1, it is clear that the RXFP2/INSL3 receptor/ligand pairing has highly specialized roles in reproduction. Studies of the distribution of RXFP2 show mRNA in rat ovary and in rat and mouse testis and gubernaculum by Northern analysis, RT-PCR, and in situ hybridization (12, 276, 298, 301, 453) ([FIGURE 4](#figure-4); [TABLE 1](#table-1)). In the rat, RXFP2 receptor mRNA has been localized to the oocyte in the ovary and the germ cells of the seminiferous tubules associated with germ cell function (276) (See sect. VIIB). A more recent study has confirmed the expression of RXFP2 mRNA in rat postmeiotic germ cells and also localized RXFP2 immunoreactivity to human postmeiotic germ cells (12). This study also demonstrated RXFP2 mRNA in rat Leydig cell, immunoreactive RXFP2 in human Leydig cells, and INSL3 binding in a Leydig cell line. In human, RXFP2 mRNA is found in uterus and testis (239, 354). The pattern of localization of RXFP2 thus correlates with the known roles of INSL3/RXFP2 in gubernacular development and reproductive physiology (see [TABLE 1](#table-1) and sect. VIIB).

#### 2. Is there a role for RXFP2 in the CNS?

RXFP2 mRNA is expressed in the rat brain with high densities in the thalamus where it is present in the intralaminar, parafascicular, dorsolateral, ventrolateral, and posterior thalamic nuclei (460). Mapping of the RXFP2 protein using 125I INSL3 revealed high peptide binding in thalamic regions but also in the striatum and certain layers of the cortex, suggesting axonal transport of receptors to terminal

RELAXIN FAMILY PEPTIDES AND THEIR RECEPTORS

sites (460). However, in situ hybridization studies of the distribution of INSL3 mRNA using oligo probes failed to provide evidence for INSL3 expression in rat brain (469), perhaps suggesting that central RXFP2 receptors respond to circulating INSL3 (see sect. IVB). Comparison between RXFP2 expression patterns in the rat and mouse revealed detailed differences, most notably the presence of both RXFP2 mRNA and protein in the cortex of the mouse with mRNA found in layer V and layer VIb and ¹²⁵I INSL3 binding present in deeper layers and also layer I (189). However, as in the rat, there was no evidence for INSL3 mRNA expression in mouse brain. (189).

### 3. Evidence for RXFP2 in other peripheral tissues

In the initial study that described the deorphanization of RXFP1 (LGR7) (239), examination of the tissue distribution of the related RXFP2 receptor by RT-PCR provided evidence for mRNA expression in brain, kidney, muscle, testis, thyroid, uterus, bone marrow, and peripheral lymphocytes (FIGURE 4; TABLE 1). Signal strength was strong in testis; weaker in lymphocytes, bone marrow, and brain; and weak in the remaining tissues (239). In a more detailed study in rat kidney, both RXFP2 mRNA and ¹²⁵I INSL3 binding were found in renal glomeruli and mesangial cells, with particularly high levels observed in late stage gestation. RXFP2 receptor-mediated responses are present in human and mouse osteoblasts related to roles for INSL3 in bone function (162) (see sect. VII B). RXFP2 mRNA is also expressed in human thyroid tissues and in mouse follicular thyroid epithelial cells (225).

### C. Localization of RXFP3 and RXFP4: The Receptors for Relaxin-3 and INSL5

#### 1. RXFP3 has a widespread distribution in the CNS

Following deorphanization, RXFP3 was found to be highly expressed in the human brain as determined by RT-PCR (352). Subsequent studies identified the brain as the predominant site of RXFP3 expression in the mouse by Northern blotting and in both mouse and rat by in situ hybridization (62, 314). In rat brain, high levels of mRNA were found in the olfactory bulb, paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei, and preoptic and posterior areas of the hypothalamus, hippocampus, septum, and amygdala with lower levels in cortex, peraqueductal grey, nucleus incertus, and areas of brain stem (FIGURE 6) (314, 508). The chimeric peptide ¹²⁵I-R3/I5, a selective, high-affinity ligand for RXFP3 and RXFP4, has been used to identify chimeric receptor binding sites in the cerebral cortex, olfactory bulb, and superior colliculus in the rat (RXFP4 is a pseudogene in the rat) (FIGURE 6) (312).

Recent studies provide a comprehensive description of the distribution of RXFP3 in mouse brain (487) by both in situ hybridization and peptide binding. While the overall pattern is very similar to that in the rat, suggesting a strongly conserved ligand-receptor pairing, there are some detailed differences. For example, in the mouse, both peptide and RXFP3 are present in the substantia innominata and the olivary and posterior pretectal nuclei, whereas in the rat expression in the olfactory bulb, entorhinal cortex, arcuate nucleus, and paraventricular thalamic nucleus is more dominant (487). As yet, there are no systematic studies of RXFP3 localization in human or primate brain.

#### 2. Evidence for RXFP3 in peripheral tissues

The first studies on the expression of RXFP3 mRNA in human tissues indicated very low expression of RXFP3 mRNA in the adrenal gland, testis, salivary gland, and pancreas by RT-PCR. Subsequent studies demonstrated RXFP3 mRNA expression in the human testis by RT-PCR (314), although the function of the receptor in this tissue is not known.

#### 3. Expression of RXFP4

Studies prior to the deorphanization of RXFP4 examined the distribution of the orphan GPCR, GPR100 using Northern blotting of human tissues. Expression of GPR100 was identified principally in peripheral tissues including heart, skeletal muscle, salivary gland, bladder, kidney, liver, placenta, stomach, jejunum, thyroid, ovary, and bone marrow with the highest expression in the pancreas (63) (FIGURE 4; TABLE 1). Subsequent studies following the deorphanization of RXFP3 showed high levels of receptor mRNA expression by RT-PCR in the human colon with additional expression in the placenta, testis, thymus, prostate, kidney, and brain (313). The expression of RXFP4 in the colon matches the expression of the INSL5 peptide and indicates potential functions of INSL5 as a gut hormone (see sect. VIIID).

VI. SIGNAL TRANSDUCTION PATHWAYS ACTIVATED BY RELAXIN FAMILY PEPTIDE RECEPTORS

### A. Pleiotropic Signaling Pathways Activated by RXFP1

Since type A LGRs and the coevolved genes encoding glycoprotein hormone subunits can be traced to both nematodes and insects, the three subfamilies of LGRs are thought to have evolved before the emergence of vertebrates and nematodes (237). The signaling pathways activated by RXFP1 and RXFP2 therefore represent one of the earliest forms of GPCR signaling (42). RXFP1 and RXFP2 couple to a variety of G proteins to influence cAMP accumulation within a number of cell lines (198, 237, 239). In addition, there is evidence for

Physiol Rev • VOL 93 • JANUARY 2013 • www.prv.org 431

activation of MAP kinases, tyrosine kinases and nitric oxide (NO) as well as activation of signaling pathways associated with connective tissue metabolism, much of which predates receptor identification [FIGURE 7A].

There is further evidence suggesting that relaxin activates the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), a nuclear receptor that acts as a ligand-dependent transcription factor (130). Activation of the GR by relaxin, and the subsequent changes in gene transcription, may account for the many effects of relaxin on the expression levels of a variety of proteins, including those involved in connective tissue metabolism (see sect. VIA4). Relaxin stimulation of differentiated THP-1 cells (into a macrophage phenotype) blunts the production of cytokines including interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and this effect is abolished by the GR antagonist RU 486 (128). Relaxin coimmunoprecipitates with the GR, and the amount of the GR within the nucleus increased after 30 min stimulation with relaxin (128). Furthermore, a modified relaxin that was unable to activate RXFP1 could still interact with the GR, and relaxin

was found to cause phosphorylation of S211 of the GR, which is used as a biomarker of agonist-related receptor activation (128). Indeed relaxin, via its interaction with the GR, is also able to autoregulate its own expression (131). Thus, although relaxin appears to interact with the GR independently of its own receptor, the relative contribution of this pathway to the physiological effects of relaxin, and how this integrates with the more classical relaxin-stimulated signaling pathways, remains to be determined.

1. Increases in cAMP levels mediated by RXFP1: a second messenger system influenced by many interacting mechanisms

In studies predating receptor identification, treatment with relaxin was found to cause an increase in cAMP accumulation in THP-1 cells (411), MCF-7 cells (57), the mouse pubic symphysis (69), uterine strips (446), uterine longitudinal muscle (399) from estrogen-primed rats, and in cultures of human endometrial cells (156), human endometrial glandular epithelial cells (96), newborn rhesus monkey

![Figure 7](#fig7)

**FIGURE 7.** Signal transduction mechanisms activated by interaction of relaxin family peptides with their cognate RXFP receptors. Relaxin interacts with RXFP1 (A) to cause coupling of the receptor with Gαs to activate adenylyl cyclase (AC) and GαoB to modulate this effect (198, 236, 237). The receptor also couples to Gαi3 and βγ subunits from this interaction to activate PI-3-kinase to cause translocation of PKC-ζ, which in turn activates AC5 (198, 204, 382, 383). cAMP resulting from these interactions appears to be compartmentalized and influences different signaling outcomes (197). INSL3 activates RXFP2 (B) to couple to Gαs and GαoB and influence cAMP production (198, 301). Relaxin-3 binds to RXFP3 (C) causing coupling to Gαi2 and GαoB and inhibition of AC (314). Release of βγ subunits from these G proteins activates MAPK signaling and NFκB transcription (545, 546). Relatively little is known of INSL5/RXFP4 signaling (D), but the receptor couples to Gαi2 and GαoB in a similar fashion to RXFP3 (313) but also couples to Gα16 and Ca²⁺ when this promiscuous G protein has been transfected into cells (315).

uterine cells (294), rat myometrial cells (235), and rat anterior pituitary cells (109). The physiological relevance of the cAMP response to relaxin is particularly well demonstrated in human endometrial stromal cells, where basal and relaxin-stimulated cAMP levels are enhanced by inhibition of phosphodiesterase (PDE) 4 **(FIGURE 7A)**, and relaxin stimulation and PDE 4 inhibition act synergistically to induce decidualization (37). Increases in cAMP in response to relaxin (243, 512) or addition of a cell-permeable cAMP analog (517) induce decidualization, which is an important process required to support implantation of the developing embryo. Increases in cAMP are also linked to the physiological effects of relaxin upon angiogenesis; treatment with human relaxin in a murine model increased the degree of angiogenesis at wound sites, an effect that was associated with an increased expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), an important proangiogenic protein (see sect. VIIA 4) (541). Interestingly, in cultures of normal human endometrial cells (NHE cells), human relaxin increased VEGF expression, and these effects are prevented by AC inhibition and mimicked by either the AC activator forskolin or a PDE inhibitor (540). This suggests that relaxin-stimulated cAMP production also mediates increased VEGF transcription, and thus angiogenesis (see sect. VIIA 4).

Following receptor characterization, the importance of cAMP as a signaling pathway for relaxin was cemented by the observation that constitutively active mutants of both RXFP1 and RXFP2 (transmembrane helix 6: D637Y) increased cAMP accumulation in a ligand-independent manner **(FIGURE 3)** (237, 239). Many subsequent studies have focused on cAMP accumulation generated by activation of these two receptors. It is now well recognized that both RXFP1 and RXFP2 couple to Gαs to increase cAMP (198, 237, 239), an effect that is negatively modulated by coupling to GαOB (198). Only RXFP1 can couple to Gαi3 to activate a further surge of cAMP accumulation via a Gβγ-phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-protein kinase C (PKC)-ζ pathway to stimulate adenylyl cyclase 5 (AC5) **(FIGURE 7A)** (198, 204, 382, 383).

Activation of the unique Gαi3 pathway by RXFP1 was initially identified in THP-1 cells that endogenously express the receptor. In this cell line, relaxin causes a biphasic increase in cAMP accumulation over time, with the later phase partially susceptible to the PI3K inhibitors LY 294002 and wortmannin; subsequently, relaxin stimulation of RXFP1 was also shown to increase PI3K activity (383). PKC-ζ was proposed as the candidate protein that linked PI3K activation to cAMP formation. Indeed, studies that predated receptor identification in human cultured secretory endometrial stromal cells showed that human relaxin treatment over 4 days increased the amount of PKC activity in membranes versus cytosolic fractions of the cell (272); these observations support the concept of relaxin-stimulated translocation of PKC to the cell membrane.

The atypical PKC isoforms, including PKC-ζ, are insensitive to diacylglycerol and Ca²⁺ but are either directly or indirectly activated by phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP₃) and other lipids (378, 397, 493). Furthermore, some general PKC inhibitors (including bisindoylmaleamide I) have very low activity for the atypical isoforms (341, 536). Porcine relaxin was found to cause a concentration-dependent translocation of PKC-ζ to the cell membrane in a number of cell lines: MCF-7 (human breast cancer), PHM1–31 (pregnant human myometrial), MMC (mouse mesangial), and human monocytic (THP-1) cells (382). PKC-ζ translocation was dependent on PI3K activation by relaxin, but independent of cAMP accumulation **(FIGURE 7A)**; furthermore, PI3K-dependent cAMP increases mediated by relaxin were dependent on PKCζ expression (382). In MCF-7 cells, relaxin stimulation activates PI3K and causes translocation of PKC-ζ without increasing cAMP accumulation; however, subsequent transfection of AC5, but not AC2 or AC4, into these cells produced a cAMP response to relaxin (381). Thus RXFP1 activates PI3K, precipitating the translocation of PKCζ to the cell membrane, whereby the protein stimulates AC5 **(FIGURE 7A)**.

This pathway has also been demonstrated in HEK293 cells transiently or stably expressing RXFP1 (198, 204), and was found to be downstream of Ga and Gβγ subunits. Experiments utilizing Gαi/o mutants that are insensitive to ADP ribosylation by pertussis toxin (PTX) revealed initial coupling of RXFP1 to inhibitory GαOB (in addition to Gαs) and identified Gαi3 as the mediator of the Gβγ-PI3K-PKC-ζ-AC5 pathway. Interestingly, a PTX-sensitive stimulation of cAMP had been previously demonstrated in an endogenous setting: in rat left atria, relaxin induced a small increase in cAMP accumulation that was reduced by PTX pretreatment, and PTX pretreatment also reduced the inotropic and chronotropic responses to relaxin (290), indicating the physiological relevance of this signaling pathway. This pathway has recently been shown to be of greater importance in the failing heart (typically characterized by increased Gαi/o expression) (66, 150), allowing preservation of the positive inotropic effects of relaxin in humans (127).

Site-directed mutagenesis identified the final 10 amino acids of the RXFP1 COOH terminus, and in particular R752 as essential residues for activation of the Gαi3 pathway **(FIGURE 3)** (204). The activation of this pathway is also dependent on the presence of lipid-rich membrane domains, suggesting a degree of specific compartmentalization of the RXFP1-stimulated cAMP response (204). Furthermore, GTPγS-immunoprecipitation assays identified activation of Gαi3 immediately following stimulation of RXFP1 by relaxin, thus suggesting the delay in activation of the Gαi3-

Gβγ-PI3K-PKCζ-AC5 pathway is downstream of the G protein itself (204). In HEK 293 cells, only activation of Ga<sub>s</sub> and Ga<sub>OB</sub>-dependent cAMP signaling pathways increases CRE-mediated gene transcription, whereas Ga<sub>i3</sub>-mediated signaling appears to selectively regulate NFκB-dependent gene transcription (FIGURE 7A) (197). This observation again suggests compartmentalization of relaxin-RXFP1 signaling events and infers that distinct physiological outcomes could be anticipated downstream of different cAMP signaling pathways (197).

Recently, a constitutive RXFP1-dependent cAMP response has been identified using FRET-based cAMP biosensors in single rat cardiac fibroblasts, HeLa cells, and HEK 293 cells expressing RXFP1 (201). The response is dependent on a protein complex, or signalosome, centered upon the relaxin receptor, and the signalosome is highly sensitive to attomolar concentrations of relaxin. Importantly, this may provide the basis for cellular responses to low levels of relaxin present in the circulation. The signalosome consists of RXFP1 that is scaffolded to AC2 by AKAP79, facilitating efficient activation of the AC by Ga<sub>s</sub> and Gβγ subunits. The cAMP produced is tightly regulated by the activity of protein kinase A-activated PDE4D3, that is in turn scaffolded to the receptor COOH terminus (specifically requiring S704) by β-arrestin 2 (FIGURE 8A) (201). The stimulatory (AKAP79 and AC2) and regulatory (β-arrestin 2, PKA, and PDE4D3) arms of the signalosome are both spatially and functionally distinct. Knockdown of AKAP79 does not affect interaction of regulatory components with the receptor, and knockdown of β-arrestin 2 does not influence interactions between RXFP1 and the stimulatory components. Targeted protein knockdown or overexpression of dominant negative mutants (201) demonstrates that the complex is isoform specific (i.e., interacting with PDE4D3 but not PDE4D5) (234) and that assembly of the regulatory components is dependent on constitutive association between the receptor and β-arrestin 2, but not β-arrestin 1 (FIGURE 8A) (120). cAMP production by the RXFP1-signalosome is dependent on constitutive association between helix 8 of the receptor and AKAP79, but not gravin (AKAP250) or AKAP149 (21, 122, 484). Importantly, this signaling mechanism is distinct from those activated by higher concentrations of relaxin, and the complex dissociates following activation.

![Figure 8](#fig8)

**FIGURE 8.** Atypical signaling mechanisms utilized by RXFP1 and RXFP3. Signaling complexes termed signalosomes are formed between RXFP1, AKAP79, AC2, PKA, PDE4D3, and β-arrestin-2 (A) (196, 201). These complexes are exquisitely sensitive and respond to attomolar concentrations of relaxin with increases in cAMP (B). This signaling mechanism is distinct from those utilized by higher concentrations of relaxin, and exposure of the receptor to nanomolar concentrations causes dissociation of the signalosome (C) and cAMP production by the canonical pathways (see FIGURE 7). RXFP3 displays signaling bias with respect to the cognate peptide human relaxin-3 and human relaxin-2 (545). Interaction of relaxin-3 with RXFP3 leads to inhibition of adenylyl cyclase and activation of MAP kinases, NFκB and AP-1 transcription (D), whereas human relaxin-2 causes only a subset of these pathways to be activated (E).

RELAXIN FAMILY PEPTIDES AND THEIR RECEPTORS

tivation of RXFP1 with nanomolar concentrations of peptide that increase cAMP by previously described mechanisms (FIGURES 7A AND 8C) (198). The high degree of sensitivity exhibited by the RXFP1 signalosome has been demonstrated previously in a few other physiological systems, including suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokine production by interleukin-15 (6), proliferation of helper T-cells by interleukin-1 (398), the effects of neuropeptides and neurosteroids in nociception (447, 537), and the long-term effects of transforming growth factor-β on basal FSH levels (575). However, although signalosome formation and activity has also been demonstrated in primary cells endogenously expressing RXFP1, the exact physiological role for the mechanism has yet to be determined.

Relaxin-induced cAMP accumulation may also occur via a G protein-independent mechanism, and in some cells increased cAMP accumulation may be downstream of a tyrosine kinase. In THP-1 cells and cultures of primary human myometrial or endometrial stromal cells, porcine relaxin induced an increase in cAMP accumulation that was blocked by inhibition of tyrosine kinase activity (13, 38, 216, 302). This same response was potentiated by the phosphotyrosine phosphatase inhibitors [bpV(phen) and mpV(pic)] that mimic the effect of tyrosine kinase activation (38). Indeed, in studies predating receptor identification in human lower uterine segment fibroblasts, relaxin stimulation resulted in tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular extracts, with no effect on cAMP accumulation (407). Relaxin-mediated increases in cAMP accumulation in this context are thought to occur via a tyrosine kinase-mediated inhibition of a PDE, thereby preventing cAMP hydrolysis and thus increasing cAMP levels. Interestingly, studies have also shown that the same tyrosine kinase inhibitors did not affect relaxin-stimulated cAMP accumulation in HEK293 cells expressing RXFP1 (13), emphasizing the variation in cellular responses that can be observed between different cell types. In those cells utilizing the tyrosine kinase pathway however, there was also some degree of cAMP inhibition in the presence of the PI3K inhibitor, LY 294002 (13, 216), and evidence of a negative feedback loop involving PKA (13).

A number of other studies in an endogenous setting have also demonstrated activation of PKA downstream of cAMP. Increased cAMP accumulation by relaxin results in PKA activation in a human myometrial cell line (124). In this case, PKA (via its interaction with AKAP79) can inhibit the phosphoinositide turnover that is stimulated by oxytocin and is required for smooth muscle contraction (124, 592). In the same cell line, human relaxin can also stimulate a Ca²⁺-sensitive K⁺ channel independently of increases in Ca²⁺; a PKA inhibitor, Rp-cAMPS, prevented the effects of relaxin, and the stimulation was mimicked by the addition of PKAα-catalytic subunits to the preparation (364). Furthermore, the inhibition of oxytocin-induced events by relaxin is attributed to activation of PKA, and is prevented following the use of a PKA inhibitor (16, 247). Thus relaxin stimulation of RXFP1 absolutely results in the activation of cAMP-PKA pathways, although the precise mechanism whereby RXFP1 initiates cAMP accumulation appears to vary somewhat with cell type.

2. Activation of RXFP1 causes increased phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases

In addition to increased cAMP accumulation, a number of cell types that express RXFP1 including human endometrial stromal cells (586), THP-1 cells and primary cultures of human coronary artery cells, pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells, renal myofibroblasts (370), and fibrochondrocytes (4) respond to relaxin with a rapid activation of p42/44 MAPK (extracellular signal regulated kinase 1/2, ERK1/2) (FIGURE 9).

In normal human endometrial cells (NHE cells), relaxin stimulation causes rapid and transient phosphorylation of ERK1/2, with a peak response between 5–10 min (586). The same time course profile following relaxin stimulation was also recorded for phosphorylation of MEK and CREB, but in these cells there was no effect of relaxin treatment on Akt or JNK phosphorylation; furthermore, an inhibitor of MEK abolished phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in response to relaxin, suggesting that MEK is activated upstream of ERK1/2 (586). Increased phosphorylation of ERK1/2 following relaxin stimulation was also observed in THP-1 cells and cultures of human coronary artery and pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells and the MEK-ERK1/2 pathway was also found to control relaxin-stimulated transcription of VEGF in these cells (FIGURE 9) (586).

In contrast to the brief increase in ERK1/2 phosphorylation described above, relaxin stimulation caused a more prolonged increase in ERK1/2 phosphorylation in HeLa cells and primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) (129). Furthermore, in HeLa, EAhy 926 (an endothelial cell line), HT-29 (a colonic cell line), and primary fibrochondrocyte cells, relaxin increased the phosphorylation of both ERK1/2 and Akt after 30 min (FIGURE 9) (4, 128). In primary fibrochondrocytes, it has also been shown that in addition to ERK1/2 and Akt, treatment with relaxin also activates PI-3-kinase, PKC-ζ, NFκB, c-fos, and Elk-1 all of which influence the expression of MMP-9 (4) (see sect. VIIA5). Similarly, relaxin induces a sustained increase in ERK1/2 phosphorylation in rat renal myofibroblasts, and this was potentiated by inhibition of Gi/o by PTX, suggesting that phosphorylation of ERK1/2 may be downstream of G protein coupling (370). In contrast, in human vascular smooth muscle cells (hVSMC), relaxin stimulation did not affect ERK1/2 phosphorylation but instead increased the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK (129). Thus, although relaxin increases phosphorylation of a number of kinases in multi-

FIGURE 9. Vasodilator mechanisms activated by relaxin acting at RXFP1 receptors. Relaxin induces vasodilation by activation of multiple mechanisms. Vasodilation occurs both acutely and chronically, and the action of relaxin differs in different blood vessels and in humans even with medication being administered (171). Acute actions that likely influence vascular tone include cAMP generation and increases in NO generation (104, 385). Chronic actions include the induction of eNOS, nNOS, and iNOS that in addition to the direct effects of NO cause increased expression of MMPs that cleave big ET-1 to release ET(1–32) that acts on ET<sub>B</sub> receptors to cause NO-dependent vasorelaxation (265).

ple cell types, the precise isoform and mode of activation appears to vary, and the physiological consequences of activation of these pathways are as yet unclear.

3. Role of NO signaling in RXFP1-mediated responses

There is a large volume of evidence that shows relaxin treatment increases NO synthesis both acutely and chronically, although the exact mechanism and whether this is directly or indirectly linked to RXFP1 is still unclear (104, 385). Several physiological effects of relaxin within the cardiovascular system are mediated by NO, including inhibition of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced neutrophil adhesion in coronary endothelial cells (386), inhibition of the activation of neutrophils by proinflammatory agents via increased inducible NO synthase (36) expression (345), increased coronary blood flow in rat and guinea pig hearts (36), and the increased renal vasodilation and hyperfiltration in rats via the ET<sub>B</sub> receptor (FIGURE 9) (113). Relaxin also increases

RELAXIN FAMILY PEPTIDES AND THEIR RECEPTORS

the activity and expression of the three types of NOS: endothelial NOS (eNOS; NOS III) (19, 20, 27, 28), inducible NOS (iNOS; NOS II) (20, 28, 30, 31, 89, 154, 345, 346, 427), and neuronal NOS (nNOS; NOS I) (19) [FIGURE 9]. Furthermore, activation of NOS by relaxin results in downstream increases in cGMP, due to production of NO and activation of guanylyl cyclase (30–32, 346). Based on activation of NOS and cGMP, there are a number of pathways by which relaxin could increase NO production. First, eNOS activity can be increased by Akt phosphorylation; thus coupling of RXFP1 to $Ga_{\alpha 3}$ and the associated release of G$\beta \gamma$ subunits can activate PI3K, that could potentially also activate Akt, allowing phosphorylation of eNOS at S1172 (385) [FIGURE 9]. Second, iNOS activity can be upregulated following stimulation of NF$\kappa$B-controlled transcription; thus coupling of RXFP1 to $Ga_{\alpha}$ increases cAMP and activates PKA, which can then potentially phosphorylate and inactivate IkB, thereby stimulating NF$\kappa$B-controlled transcription and increasing iNOS-mediated NO production (31, 154). Indeed, the increase in iNOS expression mediated by relaxin in HUVECs (427) and rat coronary endothelial cells (154) was abolished by NF$\kappa$B inhibitors [FIGURE 9]. More evidence supporting this possibility comes from studies that demonstrate stimulation of NF$\kappa$B transcription by relaxin over short time periods (129, 130, 224), suggesting that this pathway may represent a mechanism for more transient increases in NO [FIGURE 9]. Finally, the pathway whereby relaxin stimulation of RXFP1 could upregulate eNOS in the kidney is better defined: it is hypothesized that this physiological effect of relaxin is due to increased activity of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 2 (445) or MMP9 (215, 224), which can process big endothelin (ET) to ET$_{1-32}$, ET$_{1-32}$ then activates the ET$_{\beta}$ receptor, increasing the activity of eNOS, and thus producing NO [FIGURE 9] (263).

### 4. RXFP1 signaling influences connective tissue metabolism

Relaxin can modulate connective tissue metabolism at a number of levels, including the inhibition of profibrotic factors (such as TGF-$\beta$), the inhibition of fibroblast proliferation and differentiation, and the activation of MMP-mediated extracellular matrix degradation. Identification of the signaling pathways that lead to these end points are now gaining attention, and greater knowledge of these processes should allow more targeted efforts in relaxin-related drug discovery.

TGF-$\beta$ is one of the most important cytokines in the progression of fibrosis; binding of TGF-$\beta$ to its type II receptor leads to formation of a receptor complex with the type I receptor, receptor phosphorylation, activation of a receptor (R)-Smad (Smad1, 2, 3, 5 or 8), and cotransport of R-Smad with a common (Co)-Smad (Smad4) into the nucleus to control gene expression (reviewed in Ref. 347). The antifibrotic effects of relaxin are thought to result from inhibition

of the action of TGF-$\beta$ [FIGURE 10] (349, 443, 539, 542). In human renal fibroblasts, TGF-$\beta$ increases the expression of $\alpha$-SMA (a marker of fibroblast differentiation), type I collagen, and fibronectin, and these effects are reversed by relaxin. The inhibitory effects of relaxin are due to inhibition of Smad2 (an R-Smad) (215, 370) but relaxin treatment also decreases TGF-$\beta$-induced phosphorylation of Smad2 (but not Smad3), and knockdown of Smad2 alone had an effect similar to treating the cells with relaxin (215). Subsequent studies in rat renal myofibroblasts confirmed inhibition of Smad2 phosphorylation by relaxin and identified the upstream mediators of this inhibition: nNOS-NO-cGMP (370). Thus relaxin inhibits TGF-$\beta$ and thus fibroblast differentiation by a NO-dependent pathway [FIGURE 10].

Relaxin also affects connective tissue metabolism by increasing the production of MMPs including MMP1 in human lung fibroblasts (542), human dermal fibroblasts (539) and rat renal cortical fibroblasts (349), MMP2 in rat cardiac fibroblasts (443) and renal fibroblast cell lines (215), MMP9 in renal fibroblast cell lines (215) and THP-1 cells (224), and MMP13 in rat hepatic stellate cells [FIGURE 10] (55). Increased MMP9 activity in THP-1 cells (that endogenously express relaxin receptors) was due to changes in transcriptional regulation of the MMP gene mediated by NF$\kappa$B, as inhibition of NF$\kappa$B reduced the relaxin-dependent increase in MMP9 expression and activity [FIGURE 10] (224). This may suggest an interesting link between the effects of relaxin upon MMPs and NO, both of which appear to be mediated by increased NF$\kappa$B transcription. To complement the increased production of MMPs in response to relaxin, the peptide can also decrease the expression of tissue inhibitors of MMPs (TIMPs) in human dermal fibroblasts (539), with specific inhibition of TIMP1 and TIMP2 in cultured rat hepatic stellate cells (55, 564).

A recent report indicates that relaxin increases the activity of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)$-\gamma$ (482), a nuclear receptor that heterodimerizes with the retinoid X receptor to increase the transcription of target genes (reviewed in Ref. 153). PPAR$\gamma$ has similar inhibitory effects on TGF-$\beta$ signaling and similar end-point physiological effects upon fibrosis to relaxin itself (482). Thus this observation may provide another missing link in the signaling pathways associated with connective tissue metabolism that are activated by relaxin. However, any physiological relevance of this activation, and indeed the relevance of this to relaxin signaling pathways, remains to be shown.

#### B. Signaling Pathways Activated by RXFP2

Although relaxin and INSL3 are closely related peptides and RXFP1 and RXFP2 have similar structures, the intracellular signaling pathways that are initiated following INSL3 stimulation of RXFP2 are less elaborate. INSL3 (or

FIGURE 10. The effects of relaxin acting on RXFP1 to influence connective tissue metabolism. The antifibrotic actions of relaxin are mediated through increases of expression of eNOS, nNOS, and iNOS and increased synthesis of NO. This in turn increases expression of MMPs to reduce fibrosis and also inhibits pSmad2, a mediator involved in the profibrotic effects of TGF-β.

relaxin) stimulation of RXFP2 expressed in HEK293T cells results in coupling to Gαs to increase cAMP accumulation, and to GαoB to negatively modulate increases in cAMP (FIGURE 7B) (198, 301). RXFP2 signaling therefore closely resembles the first stage of RXFP1 signaling in response to relaxin (198). There is also evidence for an inhibitory effect of Gβγ subunits upon AC; the Gβγ subunits are likely derived from GαoB, as although removal of Gβγ using βARK-ct or inhibition of Gαi/o with PTX both increased cAMP the effects were not additive (198). Unlike RXFP1, for RXFP2 there is no evidence for constitutive activity or a high sensitivity response to INSL3 (201), and in addition, RXFP2 does not activate the Gαi3-cAMP signaling pathway that is unique to RXFP1 (198, 204). Downstream of cAMP production, activation of RXFP2 (by either relaxin or INSL3) induces increased CRE-dependent gene transcription (FIGURE 7B) (197) in a manner similar to the relaxin response through RXFP1.

The effect of both Gαs and GαoB upon cAMP accumulation has also been shown in cells that endogenously express RXFP2. INSL3 stimulation of RXFP2 in rat gubernacular cells (301) and in a human osteoblast cell line (MG-63) (162) leads to increased cAMP accumulation, probably by a Gαs-mediated interaction with AC, similar to the response in HEK293T cells expressing RXFP2. However, in con-

RELAXIN FAMILY PEPTIDES AND THEIR RECEPTORS

trast, primary cultures of testicular germ cells and oocytes respond to INSL 3 activation of RXFP2 with a PTX-sensitive inhibition of cAMP accumulation (276), consistent with RXFP2 coupling to GαoB. Thus, as for RXFP1, the net signaling outcome of RXFP2 stimulation will depend on which signaling components (especially G protein isoforms) are expressed in a particular cellular background.

C. Signaling Pathways Activated Following Stimulation of RXFP3

Activation of RXFP3, by human relaxin-3, causes PTX-sensitive inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation, suggesting that the receptor is coupled to inhibitory Gαi/o proteins. RXFP3 activation by human relaxin-3 also induces phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and other MAPKs through Gαi/o via either a PI3K-dependent or PKC-dependent mechanism (FIGURE 7C) (545, 546). Although initial studies on RXFP3 suggested human relaxin-3 or the B-chain of human relaxin-3 were the only relaxin family peptides that could compete for 125I-human relaxin-3 binding or inhibit AC activity (314), more recent work has demonstrated that human relaxin-2 also has agonist actions at RXFP3 albeit activating different signaling pathways (see below) (545). Thus human relaxin-2 acts as a biased ligand relative to human relaxin-3 at RXFP3, which may be significant for the development of compounds with novel modes of action and specificity at this receptor (FIGURE 8, D AND E).

1. G protein coupling and second messenger signaling at RXFP3

Whole cell functional responses downstream of RXFP3 activation have been examined using the cytosensor microphysiometer that detects changes in whole cell metabolism by measuring fluctuations in extracellular pH, that occur due to the extrusion of H⁺ ions as a by-product of cell signaling. In CHO-K1 cells stably expressing the human RXFP3 receptor, this approach provided more evidence that RXFP3 signaling occurred mainly through the engagement of Gαi/o proteins, as pretreatment with PTX blocked human relaxin-3-stimulated increases in the extracellular acidification response (543). This was consistent with previous observations that human relaxin-3 inhibited forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation, presumably by engagement of Gαi/o proteins (314). The use of inhibitors of PI3K and MEK1/2 also indicated that signaling pathways downstream of these two kinases were activated by human relaxin-3 (see sect. VIB3). In addition, a second generalized cell signaling screen using eight different reporter gene constructs in CHO-K1 cells (transiently expressing human RXFP3 receptors) showed that following stimulation with human relaxin-3, RXFP3 activates signaling upstream of activator protein 1 (AP-1) promoters (see sect. VIB4) and NFκB promoters (see sect. VIB5), but not serum response element, CRE, heat shock element, nuclear factor of activated T-cells element, E-box DNA binding element, or glucocorticoid response element (545).

2. RXFP3 is coupled to the inhibition of cAMP accumulation in recombinant and endogenously expressing systems

Following stimulation with human relaxin-3, RXFP3 inhibits forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation in CHO-K1 or HEK293 cells stably expressing RXFP3 receptors and in mouse SN56 cells that endogenously express the receptor (FIGURE 7C) (314, 546). Human relaxin-3-mediated inhibition of AC is completely prevented in cells pretreated with PTX, suggesting that this response is Gαi/o dependent. In CHO-K1 cells transiently transfected with PTX-insensitive (C351I mutation) variants of Gαi/o proteins, and treated with PTX (to remove the influence of endogenous Gαi/o proteins), Gαi2 was the major G protein involved in the inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation, whereas in HEK293 cells, Gαi3, GαoB, and GαoA were all important (544). Together, these observations indicate that although the same downstream signal output may be observed, the signaling partners involved may vary with the different cellular context.

Forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation is also inhibited in RXFP3-expressing cells by human relaxin-3 B-chain peptides or to a lesser degree by human relaxin-2 and porcine relaxin in the CHO-K1, HEK293, and SN56 cell backgrounds (314, 545, 546). These responses likely also occur via RXFP3 engagement of Gαi/o proteins, although this remains to be determined.

3. Activation of RXFP3 increases phosphorylation of ERK1/2

Human relaxin-3 activation of RXFP3 causes a rapid and transient increase in ERK1/2 phosphorylation (peak response 2–5 min) in CHO and HEK293 cells, stably expressing human RXFP3 (FIGURE 7C) (545, 546). Examination of a variety of relaxin family peptides revealed that in addition to human relaxin-3, the human relaxin-3 B-chain dimer also activates ERK1/2 albeit with low potency and efficacy (546). There was also a weak response to human relaxin-2 but no detectable response to porcine relaxin or INSL3 (545). Pretreatment with PTX caused an ~90% inhibition of human relaxin-3 stimulated ERK1/2 phosphorylation in CHO-RXFP3 cells, whereas in HEK-RXFP3 cells the signal was completely abolished (546). This suggests that the coupling of RXFP3 to PTX-sensitive Gαi/o proteins mediates ERK1/2 phosphorylation, in both recombinant and endogenous systems (546).

RXFP3-mediated ERK1/2 phosphorylation occurs via two parallel pathways, both of which are downstream of Gαi/o

in both CHO-K1 and HEK293 cells stably expressing human RXFP3 receptors, and in SN56 cells endogenously expressing mouse RXFP3 receptors. The first pathway is dependent on PI3K activation (~50% blockade of human relaxin-3 stimulated ERK1/2 phosphorylation by the PI3K inhibitors LY294002 or wortmannin), while the other pathway requires PKC (partial blockade of ERK1/2 phosphorylation by both general and isoform-selective PKC inhibitors) **(FIGURE 7C)** (546). Interestingly, many MAPKs, including ERK1/2, are implicated in central feeding responses in rats (374, 448, 468), which may suggest that activation of ERK1/2 by RXFP3 is a physiologically relevant signaling pathway, although direct links between RXFP3, ERK1/2 activation, and increases in feeding remain to be shown.

### 4. RXFP3 activates AP-1-linked reporter genes

Since multiple MAPK signaling pathways [p38 MAPK (436), JNK (116), and ERK1/2 (423, 558)] converge on AP-1 elements to increase gene transcription, and are likely involved in activation of the AP-1-linked reporter genes, it was postulated that RXFP3 may also couple to other MAPK pathways **(FIGURE 8, D AND E)** (see sect. VIB3). Indeed, human relaxin-3-mediated AP-1 reporter gene activation was completely blocked in CHO-RXFP3 cells pretreated with the p38 MAPK inhibitor (RWJ67657), whereas a MEK inhibitor (PD98059) or a JNK inhibitor (SP600125) shifted the human relaxin-3 concentration-response curve to the right. In contrast, in HEK-RXFP3 cells, JNK inhibition abolished human relaxin-3-stimulated AP-1 reporter activation, whereas p38 MAPK or MEK inhibition shifted concentration-response curves to the right. In SN56 cells (as in CHO-K1 cells), p38 MAPK inhibition completely abolished AP-1 reporter gene activation and JNK and MEK inhibition partially blocked AP-1 activation (545). This suggests that all three MAPKs are involved in human relaxin-3-mediated AP-1 activation, and that the hierarchy of the different signaling pathways varies with the cell background.

Pretreating the cells with PTX blocked the human relaxin-3-stimulated AP-1 reporter activation in SN56 cells but not in CHO-RXFP3 and HEK-RXFP3 cells (545). This suggests that while AP-1 reporter gene activation was downstream of Gαi/o in a mouse-derived cell line, this same pathway was activated by a Gαi/o-independent pathway downstream of the human RXFP3 receptor (545).

These MAPK signaling pathways may have physiological significance since in forced swim tests in rats, there are dramatic increases in phosphorylated MEK1/2, ERK1/2, and JNK1/2/3 immediately following the swim test (468), suggesting that both ERK1/2 and JNK1/2/3 are important in mediating central stress responses. In addition, human relaxin-3 mRNA was increased in the nucleus incertus (516), which may correlate with the increase in MAPK activity, although the direct links between human relaxin-3, RXFP3, MAPK phosphorylation, and stress responses remain to be demonstrated in brain.

### 5. RXFP3 is coupled to NFκB signaling

Activation of RXFP3 by human relaxin-3 increased NFκB reporter gene activation in CHO and HEK293 cells transiently expressing human RXFP3, and also in SN56 cells endogenously expressing mouse RXFP3, and this activation was blocked by PTX pretreatment (545). This again suggests that NFκB activation occurs downstream of Gαi/o protein engagement by the receptor; however, the precise mechanisms and physiological significance of this pathway remain to be determined **(FIGURE 8D)**.

### 6. Ligand-directed signaling bias at RXFP3

Ligand-directed signaling bias is gaining increasing credence in GPCR pharmacology. It describes the selective stabilization of particular receptor conformations by ligands resulting in selective activation of downstream signal transduction pathways (22, 151, 277). There is now evidence that several relaxin peptides interact with RXFP3 to activate distinct signaling profiles through different, although sometimes overlapping pathways **(FIGURE 8, D AND E)**. Although the original description of RXFP3 indicated that this receptor showed a high selectivity for human relaxin-3 in both binding and AC inhibition assays (314), cross-reactivity with other relaxin peptides was not explored over a wider range of signal transduction pathways. However, monitoring the whole cell effects of relaxin family peptides, using the cytosensor microphysiometer and reporter gene assays, provided the first indication that other relaxin family peptides may elicit responses through RXFP3. Examination of the metabolic responses recorded by microphysiometry indicated that human relaxin-2 caused a small change in the extracellular acidification rate in CHO cells stably expressing RXFP3 (543). In addition, when human relaxin-2, porcine relaxin, and human INSL3 were tested in the reporter gene paradigm, human relaxin-2 was identified to have greater potency and efficacy at the AP-1 reporter gene pathway than the cognate ligand human relaxin-3; this is a hallmark of ligand-biased signaling, and suggests that this phenomenon also occurred downstream of the RXFP3 receptor **(FIGURE 8, D AND E)** (545).

Reexamination of cAMP signaling in three distinct cellular backgrounds (CHO, HEK293, and SN56) revealed strong inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation by human relaxin-3. However, human relaxin-2, porcine relaxin, and human INSL3 also inhibited the forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation albeit with much lower potency than human relaxin-3 (545). Interestingly, some species-specific inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation was observed.

RELAXIN FAMILY PEPTIDES AND THEIR RECEPTORS

tion was noted, with INSL 3 weakly inhibiting cAMP accumulation downstream of the human RXFP 3 receptor, but not downstream of the mouse RXFP 3 receptor (545). This is in contrast to a previous study, which reported no inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation by either porcine relaxin or human INSL 3 (314). Since the sensitivity of inhibitory cAMP assays is highly dependent on both the degree of activation of AC by forskolin and the time of stimulation, the differences observed between the two studies most likely result from different experimental paradigms.

Addition of human relaxin-2, porcine relaxin, and INSL 3 to RXFP 3-expressing cells caused AP-1 reporter gene activation in a concentration-dependent and cell-type-specific manner (545). AP-1 was activated in CHO-RXFP 3 and HEK-RXFP 3 cells with an order of potency of human relaxin-2 > human relaxin-3 > porcine relaxin. Human relaxin-2 also activated AP-1 in SN56 cells with a similar pattern to that in CHO-RXFP 3 and HEK-RXFP 3 cells, although the pEC₅₀ was shifted to the right (545). Given the differences observed between different species relaxins at RXFP 1 (see sect.IIC1), this shift in potency order may be reversed with the use of mouse relaxin instead of human relaxin-2. In CHO-RXFP 3 cells, human relaxin-2-mediated AP-1 reporter gene activation was strongly inhibited by the p38MAPK inhibitor (RWJ 67657) or the JNK inhibitor (SP600125); however, the MEK inhibitor (PD98059) shifted the human relaxin-2 concentration-response curve to the right without decreasing the maximum response, implicating p38MAPK and JNK as the major MAPKs involved in mediating this response downstream of human RXFP 3. Contrastingly, when the same response was examined in HEK293 cells expressing human RXFP 3, human relaxin-2-stimulated AP-1 reporter gene activation was most strongly influenced by p38MAPK or MEK inhibition and was not affected by JNK inhibition, suggesting that p38MAPK and ERK were not the major MAPKs involved in mediating this response downstream of human RXFP 3. In the SN56 cell line, expressing mouse RXFP 3, the p38MAPK, JNK, and MEK inhibitors all equally blocked the human relaxin-2-stimulated AP-1 reporter gene activation, suggesting that all three kinases were equally important in this cellular context (545). Together these results suggest that the cellular background, in addition to the species homolog of the receptor, play important roles in the pattern of activation of AP-1 reporter genes. Direct measurement of ERK1/2, p38MAPK, and JNK phosphorylation following stimulation with the relaxin family peptides has confirmed the findings of these inhibitor-based studies. Treating CHO-RXFP 3 or HEK-RXFP 3 cells with human relaxin-2 increased ERK1/2 phosphorylation in a rapid and transient manner with a peak response at 2–5 min; however, this response was not observed in the SN56 cell background (545) (Kocan et al., unpublished data).

Pretreatment with PTX failed to block either human relaxin-3-stimulated AP-1 activation in CHO-RXFP 3 or HEK-RXFP 3 cells, or porcine relaxin-stimulated AP-1 reporter gene activation in CHO-RXFP 3 cells, suggesting that human relaxin-3 and porcine relaxin activate AP-1 reporter genes by a G protein-independent mechanism, again suggesting ligand-directed signaling bias (545).

Although G protein-dependent activation of ERK1/2, p38MAPK, and JNK by human relaxin-2 and porcine relaxin were suggested initially by inhibitor studies, later confirmed by direct MAPK phosphorylation assays, the Gaᵢ/o-independent pathway remains to be identified for human relaxin-3 and porcine relaxin downstream of the human RXFP 3 receptor. All of the AP-1 reporter gene responses arising following stimulation of RXFP 3 in SN56 cells were blocked by PTX, suggesting that different signaling effectors were involved in mediating the AP-1 reporter gene activation downstream of the mouse RXFP 3 receptor (545).

D. Signaling Pathways Activated by RXFP 4

Little information currently exists about signaling pathways activated downstream of RXFP 4. Stimulation of cells recombinantly expressing human RXFP 4 by INSL 5 or human relaxin-3 increases GTPγS binding and inhibits forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation, suggesting that RXFP 4 like RXFP 3 is Gaᵢ/o coupled (FIGURE 7D) (313, 315). When RXFP 4 was coexpressed with Ga₁₆ in HEK293 cells, both INSL 5 and human relaxin-3 stimulated a strong Ca²⁺ signal in a concentration-dependent manner (313, 315), which may suggest that RXFP 4 can couple to additional G proteins; however, direct evidence for RXFP 4-G protein coupling is lacking.

E. Identification of G Proteins That Couple to RXFP Receptors

1. G proteins that couple to RXFP 1 and RXFP 2

The specificity of RXFP 1 and RXFP 2 for particular Gaᵢ/o isoforms was identified using PTX-insensitive G protein mutants (198). PTX inactivates Gaᵢ/o proteins by ADP-ribosylation of C351 so that mutation of this residue to I renders the isoform of interest insensitive to inactivation by PTX. Sequential expression of the three Gaᵢ and two Gaₒ isoforms in HEK293T cells stably expressing either RXFP 1 or RXFP 2 caused the restoration of the expected cAMP signaling profiles (following PTX pretreatment) by expression of only GaₒB for RXFP 2 and following expression of both GaₒB and Gaᵢ₃ for RXFP 1. Activation of GaₒB and Gaᵢ₃ by RXFP 1, but the selective activation of GaₒB by RXFP 2 was subsequently confirmed using [³⁵S]GTPγS immunoprecipitation; importantly, activation of Gaᵢ₃ was evident within 3 min of relaxin stimulation, suggesting that
the observed delay in activation of the Ga<sub>i3</sub>-cAMP pathway occurs downstream of receptor coupling to this G protein isoform (204). Studies using receptor mutants further demonstrated that activation of the Ga<sub>i3</sub>-cAMP pathway involves the final 10 amino acids of the RXFP1 COOH terminus and requires R752; interestingly, these 10 amino acids are missing in RXFP2 (the COOH terminus is 10 residues shorter), perhaps explaining the inability of this highly similar receptor to activate Ga<sub>i3</sub> (204).

Due to the classification of both RXFP1 and RXFP2 as GPCRs, and their ability to increase cAMP in recombinant receptor expression systems, it has been assumed that the receptors couple to Ga<sub>s</sub>. The ability of PTX to enhance the cAMP generated following stimulation of RXFP2 or in the early phase (<10 min) following stimulation of RXFP1 tends to support this view. More direct evidence has been generated using peptide fragments of the third intracellular loop of RXFP1 (minimum length 615–629; ICL3) and Ga<sub>s</sub>; addition of the RXFP1-ICL3 alone to rat tissues (striatum, cardiac and skeletal muscle membrane preparations) increased cAMP and “antagonized” the response to relaxin. Furthermore, addition of peptide fragments of Ga<sub>s</sub> “antagonized” both relaxin stimulation and RXFP1-ICL3 peptide stimulation of rat tissues (475). A functional interaction between RXFP1 and Ga<sub>s</sub> has also been demonstrated using pharmacological inhibition; application of NF449 to HEK293 cells expressing RXFP1 significantly decreased receptor-stimulated cAMP accumulation, whereas a low concentration of cholera toxin (a Ga<sub>s</sub> activator) substantially enhanced the cAMP response to relaxin (201). Taken together, this suggests that Ga<sub>s</sub> (and probably Ga<sub>oB</sub>) couples to RXFP1 within the ICL3, while coupling to Ga<sub>i3</sub> is dependent on the final 10 amino acids of the receptor COOH terminus.

### 2. G proteins that couple to RXFP3 and RXFP4

Functional assays suggest that RXFP3 and RXFP4 are Ga<sub>i/o</sub>-coupled receptors that can inhibit forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation in cells expressing the receptors (313, 314, 545). Ga<sub>i/o</sub> coupling to RXFP3 is further supported by studies in the cytosensor microphysiometer, where pretreatment of CHO-RXFP3 cells with the Ga<sub>i/o</sub> protein inhibitor PTX strongly inhibited the extracellular acidification rate response of these cells, suggesting that most of the signaling pathways activated by RXFP3 occur downstream of Ga<sub>i/o</sub> (543). RXFP3 and RXFP4 do not activate calcium signaling and are therefore presumed not to couple to Ga<sub>q</sub> proteins (313, 314). This pattern of G protein coupling is supported by more direct approaches. To examine the G protein subunits important for RXFP3 signaling, CHO-RXFP3 and HEK-RXFP3 cells were transfected with PTX-insensitive G proteins (C351I mutation), treated with PTX and then ERK1/2 activation measured to determine which G proteins could recapitulate the functional response. PTX pretreatment completely abrogated the ERK1/2 response in both

---

CHO-RXFP3 and HEK-RXFP3 cells. In CHO-RXFP3 cells, the ERK1/2 response was partially restored by transfection of Ga<sub>i2</sub> or Ga<sub>oB</sub> but not by mutant Ga<sub>i1</sub>, Ga<sub>i3</sub> or Ga<sub>oA</sub>. In HEK-RXFP3 cells, the pattern differed somewhat in that signaling was partially restored by expression of mutant Ga<sub>i2</sub> or Ga<sub>oB</sub> but also by mutant Ga<sub>oA</sub>. These differences may relate to different colocalization of receptors and G proteins in lipid rafts in particular cell types.

### F. Trafficking of RXFP Receptors

#### 1. Trafficking of RXFP1 and RXFP2 to the cell surface

Asparagine (N)-linked glycosylation is an important posttranslational modification for cell surface expression of GPCRs (430). RXFP1 has six predicted N-linked glycosylation sites within the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal tail, leucine-rich repeat, and LDLa modules, and RXFP2 has five predicted N-linked glycosylation sites within the same region (203). Western blot analysis of a hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged RXFP1 showed multiple receptor bands, with a high-molecular-mass (95 kDa) band, representing the mature, glycosylated form of the receptor and a lower molecular mass (80 kDa) band, representing the immature form of the receptor (280). Digestion of RXFP1 with endoglycosidase H or PNGaseF removes the N-linked glycosylation from the receptor, and only the lower molecular weight band is then observable by Western blot (280). Similar results have been achieved using a FLAG-tagged RXFP1 receptor where mutagenesis of each of the predicted N-linked glycosylation sites demonstrates that all such sites are utilized in RXFP1 (572). Additionally, glycosylation within the leucine-rich repeats was shown to be important for both cell-surface localization of the receptor and full cAMP signaling efficacy, but has no role in ligand binding (572). As yet, the glycosylation status of RXFP2 has not been studied in detail.

In addition to glycosylation, the LDLa modules of RXFP1 and RXFP2 are important for receptor trafficking from the ER to the plasma membrane. Expression of mutant RXFP1 receptors at the cell surface was not changed (compared to native RXFP1), by deletion of the LDLa module, or by mutation of the conserved LDLa residues, even though these receptors could no longer activate cAMP signaling in the cells (231, 280, 456). In one study, mutation of the putative N-linked glycosylation site (N36Q) decreased both cAMP production and cell surface expression (decreased to 37% compared with native RXFP1), suggesting that glycosylation of RXFP1 in the LDLa module plays a role in cell surface expression. However, an independent study on the same RXFP1 (N36Q) mutant showed only slight decreases in cell surface expression that was actually correlated with decreases in total cell expression. In RXFP2, mutation of the conserved cysteine residue (C71Y) or the conserved as-
RELAXIN FAMILY PEPTIDES AND THEIR RECEPTORS

partic acid residue (D70Y) (which destabilizes the LDLa module) (231) decreased the expression of receptors at the cell surface and compromised cAMP signaling (compared with native RXFP 2), also suggesting that the LDLa module is important in cell surface expression of RXFP 2 (64). In addition, swapping the LDLa modules of RXFP 1 and RXFP 2 to produce a chimeric receptor improved cell surface delivery of RXFP 1, compared with native RXFP 1 (280), suggesting that the LDLa module of RXFP 2 is also important for delivery of the receptor to the plasma membrane.

RXFP 1 receptors also form functional homodimers within the ER, which are maintained while the receptors are trafficked from the ER to the plasma membrane (282, 510, 511). Together these observations suggest that RXFP 1 expression at the cell surface is regulated at a number of stages during receptor synthesis and maturation, to ensure delivery of matured, functional receptors to the cell surface.

2. Limited evidence for trafficking of RXFP 3 and RXFP 4

There are two conserved putative N-glycosylation sites in the NH₂ terminus of both RXFP 3 and RXFP 4 and an additional nonconserved site in ECL 3 of human RXFP 4; however, there is currently no information as to whether these sites are utilized or are important for receptor trafficking. Cell surface expression of RXFP 3 and RXFP 4 has only been demonstrated by whole cell radioligand binding assays (213, 545).

G. Regulation of RXFP Receptors

1. RXFP 1 and RXFP 2 are weakly regulated by phosphorylation and internalization

A consistent feature associated with biological effects mediated by RXFP 1 is sustained signaling (see sect. IX A), which is unusual for a GPCR. This is also observed when RXFP 1 and RXFP 2 are expressed in HEK293T cells where cAMP levels remain elevated for up to 6 h after ligand exposure (87). RXFP 1 and RXFP 2 also display a lack of internalization following exposure to ligand when expressed in HEK-293T cells and Cos-7 cells (FIGURE 11) (87). Both receptors are only weakly phosphorylated and internalized as measured by whole cell radioligand binding, and internalization is unaffected by overexpression of G protein-regulated kinase (GRK) 2/3, suggesting that any internalization is not regulated by these isoforms. However, GRK 4, -5, and -6 were not tested, and it remains to be determined whether RXFP 1 and RXFP 2 internalization is regulated by other GRKs. Confocal imaging of GFP-tagged β-arrestin also failed to show cell surface localization of β-arrestin in cells cotransfected with either RXFP 1 or RXFP 2 (FIGURE 11) (87), suggesting that the receptors do not recruit either of the nonvisual β-arrestin isoforms. In primary human decidual cells and HEK293T cells stably transfected with RXFP 1, weak internalization occurs upon agonist stimulation as measured by cell surface ELISA, although this may also reflect the constitutive activity of the receptor (281). Furthermore, it was suggested that overexpression of β-arrestin 2 in HEK-RXFP 1 cells further reduced the number of cell surface receptors (281). Interestingly, a recent study provided evidence for constitutive association between RXFP 1 (but not RXFP 2) and β-arrestin 2, which controls the endogenous constitutive activity of the receptor by scaffolding PDE4D 3 (201). Thus β-arrestin maybe involved in RXFP 1 signaling but is not recruited following receptor stimulation nor is it associated with the internalization of either RXFP 1 or RXFP 2.

2. RXFP 3 internalization in response to agonist exposure

Internalization of RXFP 3 occurs following 10 min of stimulation with human relaxin-3 in CHO-K 1, HEK 293, and SN 56 cell backgrounds, as assessed by radioligand internalization assays (70–90% of receptors internalized) (545). RXFP 3 internalization was also observed by confocal microscopy of a GFP-tagged RXFP 3 following stimulation with human relaxin-3 but not human relaxin-2, porcine relaxin, or INSL 3 in CHO-RXFP 3 or HEK-RXFP 3 cells (545). Studies using BRET to detect interactions between RXFP 3 and β-arrestins in CHO cells showed that human relaxin-3 but not human relaxin-2 promotes RXFP 3/β-arrestin interaction (FIGURE 12). This suggests that treatment with the cognate ligand human relaxin-3 causes RXFP 3 to undergo β-arrestin-dependent internalization. Pretreatment of cells with PTX prevented ~50% of these interactions, suggesting that they are partially mediated by Gi/o (Kocan et al., unpublished data). The detailed mechanism of RXFP 3 internalization, phosphorylation, and recycling/degradation all remain to be determined. To date, there are no data on the regulation of RXFP 4.

VII. PHYSIOLOGICAL ROLES OF PEPTIDE-RECEPTOR PAIRS

A. Relaxin-RXFP 1

Although RLN 1 was the first human relaxin gene to be cloned (245) and is expressed in decidua, trophoblasts, and prostate (208, 439), its physiological role is unclear. An native human relaxin-1 has not been isolated, although a synthetic human relaxin-1 peptide based on the structure of human relaxin-2 does have similar biological properties and potency to human relaxin-2 at RXFP 1 receptors (514). The RLN 1 gene is only found in humans and the great apes, but in some of these species, it is doubtful that a functional

peptide is produced. Even in humans where mRNA expression is detected in multiple tissues, there is no evidence for functional peptide production. It is likely that RLN1 has arisen as a result of a gene duplication event.

The RLN2 gene on the other hand (246) produces human relaxin-2 in the corpus luteum of the ovary and is released to circulate in the blood during pregnancy (47, 470), although it is also produced by the prostate in males (259). RLN2 mRNA is expressed in the corpus luteum, endometrium, decidua, placenta, and mammary gland as well as in the heart and brain (42). The RLN2 gene is equivalent to the RLN1 gene found in nonprimate species, and it encodes the relaxin peptide that was first discovered due to its roles in reproduction. The locations of sites of relaxin expression (see sect. V, **FIGURE 4**) provide a clue to the widespread roles of the relaxin-RXFP1 system extending well beyond its original roles in reproduction. This section will outline the physiological roles of relaxin acting through its receptor RXFP1 focusing predominantly on studies in rodents and correlating this with proposed physiological roles in humans. It should be noted

that the physiological roles of relaxin outlined in this section might not be relevant to other species. A detailed outline of the physiological roles of relaxin in all mammalian species can be found here (47).

### 1. Reproductive physiology in the female

Relaxin produced by the corpus luteum and/or placenta has important roles in pregnancy and parturition and is a major circulating hormone during pregnancy in all mammalian species. Relaxin has actions on the pubic symphysis, cervix, uterus, vagina, and mammary glands. It also has important roles in the cardiovascular changes that occur during pregnancy.

Modification to the pelvic girdle involving growth of the interpubic ligament is essential for successful birth in many species (47, 470, 471). Relaxin is believed to mediate the increased flexibility and elasticity of the interpubic ligament that is associated with pregnancy in several species (394, 496). In the relaxin knockout mouse, the interpubic lig-

Unstimulated cells or cells incubated with vehicle show RXFP3 receptors localized to the plasma membrane (top panels). Exposure of cells to human relaxin-3 but not human relaxin-2 caused internalization of RXFP3 receptors (bottom panels) (545). Examination of interactions between RXFP3-Rluc8 and one of the β-arrestin fusion proteins (β-arrestin 1-Venus or β-arrestin 2-Venus) cotransfected into Flp-In CHO cells using BRET showed that interactions occurred between RXFP3 and both β-arrestin 1 and β-arrestin 2 following human relaxin-3 but not human relaxin-2.

ment fails to develop, suggesting a role for relaxin (588). The mechanisms likely involve actions on collagen remodeling as in other reproductive organs (see below). Although such a role is not clear in humans or other primates (339), it has been postulated that relaxin levels correlate with severe pelvic pain and excessive joint laxity seen in some women during pregnancy (335, 340).

Relaxin is also responsible for the softening and hypertrophy of the cervix during the second half of pregnancy in mammals, which involves effects on collagen, elastin, proteoglycans, and glycosaminoglycans (47). Cervical development is impaired in both relaxin-deficient rats (83) and relaxin knockout mice (588), highlighting a role of relaxin in this process. The mechanisms involve interactions with steroid hormones and prostaglandins (47). Studies in rats demonstrate that relaxin promotes growth of epithelial and stromal cells in the cervix (82, 83) by stimulating cell proliferation (305) and inhibiting apoptosis (590). In late pregnant relaxin-deficient rats, pigs, and relaxin knockout mice, there is no dispersion or disorganization of collagen fiber bundles in the cervix as occurs in control animals (304, 327, 589). In humans, relaxin levels increase during cervical ripening, but ripening still occurs following embryo transfer where circulating relaxin levels are undetectable (139). Al-

though direct application of porcine relaxin to the cervix appeared in early studies to assist in ripening (152, 339), clinical trials with recombinant human relaxin-2 failed to confirm this finding (52).

Relaxin influences uterine contractility (295) and uterine growth (495) during pregnancy, but this role is highly species dependent. In humans, relaxin has little effect on uterine tone (337, 338), but in rat, mouse, guinea pig, hamster, and pig, the uterus is relaxed by relaxin (for review, see Ref. 47). In rat and mouse, the uterus contains relaxin binding sites and mRNA (47) in the myometrium (see sects. IVA1 and VA1).

In nonpregnant rats, the effect of relaxin on the growth and development of the uterus is associated with vascular dilation (547) and in rhesus and marmoset monkeys with endometrial angiogenesis (145, 185). In primates and rats, pretreatment with estrogens enhances the effects of relaxin (1, 145), and in pigs, estrogens are obligatory for the growth-promoting effects of relaxin (242, 581). The mechanism involved in the interaction between relaxin and estrogen is not well understood, although in rats estrogen pretreatment dramatically increases relaxin receptor binding sites in the uterus (400, 401, 515). Although these findings largely support a uterotrophic effect of relaxin, this

does not play a role in pregnancy in mice and rats (252) but is important in pigs (365). In humans it is likely that uterotropic effects of relaxin are associated only with implantation (see sect. VIIIA2) and not with the later stages of pregnancy.

Relaxin also influences the growth of the vagina during pregnancy in mice (194, 450) and rats (82, 590, 591). In relaxin knockout mice, this growth does not occur, highlighting the essential role of relaxin (589). Relaxin binding is present in the vaginal luminal epithelial cells as well as circular and longitudinal smooth muscle cells in the rat (591) and human (288). The effect of relaxin on vaginal development during pregnancy together with its actions on the cervix and pubic symphysis are essential for normal delivery in some species.

Relaxin has trophic effects on the mammary gland. In mice transgenically overexpressing mouse relaxin, there is a 20-fold increase in serum levels that is associated with hypertrophic nipple development in virgin females (158). This phenotype is absent in mice that also had deletion of RXFP1 (158). In rats (205) relaxin in combination with estrogen and progestagen promotes mammary gland development in ovariectomized immature animals. The major effect in rodents is on nipple development, whereas in pigs it is mainly on the mammary gland (248). In rats, administration of a monoclonal antibody to relaxin during the second half of pregnancy prevents nipple development (251), and an identical phenotype occurs in relaxin knockout mice (588). Pups born to relaxin knockout mice die within 24 h unless cross-fostered to wild-type mothers. The effects are entirely due to the poor nipple development as female knockout mice are able to produce milk normally (588). The same phenotype is displayed by RXFP1 knockout mice (293) and is not rescued by administration of INSL3 (274). In contrast, relaxin-deficient pigs show normal nipple development and function (248, 582). Mammary gland development in mice and rats does not require relaxin, although it may affect tissue differentiation, but in pigs the development of the mammary gland parenchyma requires relaxin. Relaxin binding sites indicative of RXFP1 receptors are present in the mammary glands of pigs, rats, and humans. In humans, RXFP1 receptors are localized to the nipple, epithelial cells (288), and stromal tissue (255).

Major cardiovascular changes are associated with pregnancy in most mammals. Relaxin directly acts on the blood vessels, kidney, and heart to contribute to the cardiovascular changes that occur during pregnancy (see sect. VIIA4). In rodents, relaxin causes a decrease in plasma osmolality during pregnancy associated with changes in thresholds for thirst and AVP secretion (311, 387). In relaxin-deficient rats (387) and relaxin knockout mice (588), the decrease in plasma osmolality does not occur. Although plasma osmolality is reduced in human pregnancy, there is currently no evidence that relaxin is involved. Relaxin may also influence water drinking during pregnancy in rodents.

Relaxin has many well-defined reproductive roles in many species, but in humans these effects are often absent or ill-defined. Relaxin is produced in the human ovary during the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle and is secreted into the circulation (99, 140, 497). It has been suggested that this relaxin facilitates implantation and maintenance of pregnancy in the first trimester. Early studies showed that administration of relaxin to monkeys caused growth of, and increased angiogenesis in, the uterus (145, 185, 214, 222). It is likely that similar effects occur in the human endometrium, since in the clinical trial of relaxin for the treatment of scleroderma (149), women who received 24-wk subcutaneous infusion of relaxin reported heavy, irregular, or prolonged menstrual bleeding (540). However, in humans and other primates, the peak of relaxin secretion in the first trimester of pregnancy coincides with embryo implantation, suggesting that relaxin is involved in implantation (see sect. VIIIA2). Although there is an association between relaxin secretion and the success of implantation in primates, it is clearly not mandatory since women without ovaries can become pregnant by ovum donation even though they have undetectable levels of circulating relaxin (267). Relaxin secretion is correlated with increased expression of RXFP1 mRNA and relaxin binding in the human endometrium in the secretory phase of the menstrual cycle (67, 88). RXFP1 immunoreactivity is also shown in endometrial stromal cells (255) in humans and monkeys (145). Relaxin also induces decidualization of endometrial stromal cells in culture (529). In contrast, relaxin does not appear to be important for the decidualization of the endometrium in mice (168).

In humans and other primates, increasing evidence points to a role for relaxin in implantation. Relaxin treatment is associated with increased endometrial angiogenesis, thickening, and bleeding (145, 185). In macaques, relaxin treatment of cycling females in the peri-implantation period increases endometrial thickness and implantation-related bleeding. Relaxin treatment also increased rates of implantation and multiple pregnancies (214). In addition, plasma levels of relaxin peak in the first trimester, coincident with embryo implantation. Rises in relaxin levels are associated with chorionic gonadotrophin (497, 498), are altered in patients with early pregnancy loss (498), and are predictive of in vitro fertilization success in granulosa cell cultures (499). However, relaxin probably only facilitates implantation since this still occurs in humans and other primates that lack ovaries (182, 267). The relaxin that is produced in the male reproductive tract appears in semen and increases sperm motility and facilitates penetration into oocytes (557). A potential role for this relaxin may be to act on the female reproductive tract to prepare the endometrium for implantation.
RELAXIN FAMILY PEPTIDES AND THEIR RECEPTORS

2. Reproductive physiology in the male

Relaxin is found in the male reproductive tract in most mammals. Human relaxin-2 has been purified from human male seminal plasma and is identical to luteal relaxin (567). The source of this relaxin appears to be the prostate (489, 576), but its function in the male is unknown, although as discussed above seminal relaxin may be involved in implantation. RXFP1 has been localized to sperm in both mice (293) and humans (91, 160), and treatment of human sperm with relaxin increases motility (91) and induces hyperactivation, intracellular calcium and cAMP, and acrosome reaction in human sperm (160).

Prostate-derived relaxin may have local actions in the male reproductive tract, since the testis and prostate in mice (442), rats (237), and humans (239) express RXFP1 mRNA. Interestingly, studies in one strain of the relaxin and RXFP1 knockout mouse suggested a role for relaxin in male reproduction. The mice displayed poor growth of the reproductive tract with the relaxin knockout, demonstrating effects on the epididymis, seminal vesicles, and prostate (442), whereas the RXFP1 knockout mice displayed a smaller epididymis (293). Reduced growth was associated with increased collagen as demonstrated in the reproductive organs of the female relaxin knockout mouse (589). Examination of sperm maturation in the relaxin and RXFP1 knockout animals suggested that there might be apoptosis in early stages of spermatogenesis (293, 442). In this relaxin knockout mouse strain (442) and one strain of RXFP1 knockout mice (293), the changes in the male reproductive tract are associated with reduced fertility. However, independent strains of Rln1−/− and RXFP1 knockout mice (180) showed no prostate phenotype, and another strain of RXFP1 knockout mice had no male reproductive tract phenotype or association with reduced fertility (274). There are also reports that the phenotypes seen in early generations of relaxin and RXFP1 knockout are lost in later generations (257), a similar phenomenon to that seen in the INSL6 knockout (85). The authors suggest that the phenotype may “be taken as evidence of a genuine physiology, but one which because of redundancy, genetic modifiers, and possibly transgenerational epigenetic modification can be masked by inbreeding” (257). However, the contradictory results from other strains of relaxin and RXFP1 knockout mice suggest that a clear role for relaxin in the male reproductive tract awaits further studies.

late pregnancy is not observed in relaxin knockout mice (588). In humans, there is a decrease in plasma osmolality with pregnancy, but this may not be an effect of relaxin, since women that become pregnant following ovum donation have undetectable relaxin levels yet still show this effect (267, 268). However, the apparent lack of relaxin in these conditions may have to be reassessed using more sensitive methods of detection since the discovery of responses to relaxin (201) at plasma levels well below the level of detection using current ELISA techniques. In rats, water consumption is strongly stimulated by relaxin and is also increased in the second half of pregnancy (396, 502). Intracerebroventricular (ICV) or intravenous relaxin also promotes drinking in nonpregnant rats (502). In rats given relaxin monoclonal antibodies in the second half of pregnancy, there is a reduction in water consumption. These actions are produced by relaxin acting on RXFP1 receptors located in the SFO and OVLT (FIGURE 6). Administration of porcine or human relaxin-2 (intravenously) causes increased c-fos expression in neurons of the peripheral and dorsal segments of the SFO and in the dorsal cap region of the OVLT, as well as in the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus (361, 362, 504, 505), all sites of localization of RXFP1 (FIGURE 6). Circulating relaxin penetrates these brain regions and may be responsible for the plasma osmolality changes that occur during pregnancy (556).

Other central actions of relaxin have been studied in much less detail. RXFP1 receptors in the circumventricular organs and hypothalamic nuclei may have a role in the timing of parturition in rats since this is disrupted by central administration of a relaxin monoclonal antibody (503). RXFP1 receptors are highly expressed in the basolateral amygdala and administration of relaxin to this region impairs fear-related memory consolidation in rats (331). However, no specific agonist or antagonist studies have been carried out to determine whether these effects are mediated by RXFP1 or to determine the source of endogenous relaxin that activates these receptors (86). Although RXFP1 is also highly expressed in other regions associated with memory formation such as the neocortex, thalamic nuclei, hippocampus, and supramammillary nucleus (FIGURE 6), there are no studies to date that have examined possible effects on memory. RXFP1 receptors are also present in the oxytocin-containing cells of the paraventricular and supraoptic hypothalamic nuclei (81), and relaxin administration increases oxytocin neuron activity and oxytocin release (555).

3. Central actions of relaxin on RXFP1

In mammals, relaxin acts directly on receptors located in the SFO and OVLT to cause a reduction in plasma osmolality (504). In rats, the decline in plasma osmolality during the second half of pregnancy is associated with increased serum relaxin levels (311, 472) and is absent in pregnant relaxin-deficient rats that have undergone ovariectomy or been treated with relaxin antibodies (387). Likewise, in wild-type mice, the decrease in plasma osmolality that occurs in

4. Effects of relaxin on the cardiovascular system

Relaxin has an important role in many of the adaptive cardiovascular changes that occur in pregnancy (101). These include increases in plasma volume, cardiac output, and heart rate, as well as decreased blood pressure and vascular resistance (103, 104, 118, 119). In both female and male rats, relaxin administration increases renal plasma flow and
glomerular filtration rate (114) and in female rats causes the reduction in plasma osmolality associated with pregnancy (387). In rats, ovariectomy or passive immunization with monoclonal antibodies for rat relaxin prevent these adaptive changes (387). In humans, relatively few studies have been conducted; however, they do suggest similar effects of relaxin on the cardiovascular system. In the clinical trial for scleroderma, long-term (6mo) infusion of relaxin increased creatinine clearance and produced a modest decrease in blood pressure (149, 527). More recent trials of relaxin for the treatment of cardiac failure have shown that a short (24h) infusion of relaxin is associated with decreased systemic vascular resistance, serum creatinine, pulmonary wedge pressure, and a small decrease in systolic blood pressure (133, 134, 527). Comparison of the cardiovascular changes that occur in pregnancy with those seen following administration of relaxin shows marked similarity in both rats and humans (105).

Vasodilation in arterioles, capillaries, and venules is a common response to relaxin in reproductive tissues (35, 304, 547), heart (33, 36, 343), liver (34), and cecum (58). Relaxin is a potent vasodilator in arteries (102, 360), although the effect is vessel specific (360). Relaxin is a physiological antagonist of vasoconstrictors in mesenteric arteries (348, 492), primary bovine aortic smooth muscle cells (31), and uterine artery (318). Relaxin produces its vasodilator effects in guinea pig and rat coronary arteries by increasing NO synthesis (36), later confirmed in bovine cultured smooth muscle cells (31). The hormone also reduces the rise in intracellular Ca²⁺ produced by α-thrombin or angiotensin II (31, 154). In humans, relatively few studies have been conducted, but those performed to date show vasodilator effects in gluteal resistance or subcutaneous arteries but little or no effect in pulmonary, myometrial, or placental vessels (170, 360, 415). In gluteal arteries, the vasodilator responses likely involve NO and interestingly were influenced by the medication being administered to patients. Arteries obtained from patients on ACE inhibitors showed marked attenuation of the vasodilator response to relaxin, effects that appeared to be further enhanced by inhibition of cyclooxygenase (170). However, in patients not receiving ACE inhibitors, indomethacin had little effect (170). The vasodilator mechanisms suggested for relaxin in both humans and in animal models involve activation of NOS (104, 385), VEGF, matrix metalloproteinases, ETB receptors (129, 389), and modification of the extracellular matrix of the vessel walls [FIGURE 9] (263, 307, 360, 568).

The molecular mechanisms of relaxin-induced vasodilation depend on the duration of hormone exposure, that is, there are rapid and sustained vasodilatory responses. Our current understanding is that the vasodilatory responses to relaxin are mediated by actions at its major receptor RXFP1. Rapid relaxation responses to relaxin have been recorded in human gluteal arteries (170) and rat and mouse renal but not

rat mesenteric arteries (360). The responses are endothelium dependent and blocked by NOS inhibitors, the PI3K inhibitors wortmannin and LY 294002 and by PTX pretreatment but not by the VEGF receptor antagonist SU 5416 [FIGURE 9] (360). The current data suggest that the responses involve βγ activation of PI3K, Akt phosphorylation, and eNOS. Sustained responses to relaxin also involve NOS, since blockade with L-NMMA prevents the renal hemodynamic and hyperfiltration responses to relaxin (114), and these effects can be recapitulated in vitro (389). Treatment with NOS inhibitors or removal of the endothelium also enhances contractions of vascular smooth muscle to agonists in both pregnant rats (111, 179) and in rats treated chronically with relaxin (389). The mechanism involved does not appear to be attributable to changes in NOS expression, since the alterations in renal haemodynamics associated with pregnancy are not accompanied by large changes in NOS expression. In pregnant rats, eNOS expression in the renal artery fell by 39%, whereas iNOS and nNOS expression increased by 31 and 25%, respectively (5). Rather, it is likely that the vasodilator response involves endothelin acting at endothelial ETB receptors to release NO [FIGURE 9]. This could be further enhanced as a result of increased expression of the ETB receptor (129), although other studies have failed to find support for this mechanism (279). What is clear, however, is that the ETB receptor antagonist RES-701-1 blocks the renal hemodynamic changes produced by relaxin (113) in rats and antagonizes inhibition of renal artery smooth muscle produced by relaxin or in pregnancy (389). Similar effects are produced in vitro by the ET receptor antagonist SB 209670 but not by the ETA selective BQ123 (179).

There is substantial evidence to suggest that the ligand that interacts with ETB receptors to activate NOS is ET₁₋₃₂, produced by the action of MMP2 and MMP9 on big ET (163). The link to relaxin is that in blood vessels from pregnant or relaxin-treated nonpregnant rats, pro-MMP2 and MMP2 activity and pro-MMP2 protein and mRNA are increased (262, 263). MMP9 activity also appears to be increased somewhat, although more recent studies suggest that MMP9 is more important in relatively short-term responses to relaxin (4–6h) with reversal of the effects being produced by MMP9 rather than MMP2 neutralizing antibody (264). The involvement of MMP2 and MMP9 in the vasodilator responses to relaxin or pregnancy is supported by studies with MMP inhibitors. The selective MMP2 inhibitor cyclic CTTHWGFTLC, the MMP inhibitor GM6001, TIMP-2, and MMP-2 neutralizing antibody all inhibit the vasodilator actions of relaxin in renal arteries (263), whereas inhibition of the formation of ET₁₋₂₁ by phosphoramidon had no effect. These studies clearly implicate MMPs in the vasodilator actions of relaxin, although it should be borne in mind that MMPs also influence vasoreactivity by interacting with other systems such as cleavage
RELAXIN FAMILY PEPTIDES AND THEIR RECEPTORS

of calcitonin gene-related peptide to promote vasoconstriction (164).

While a case has been made for a role of VEGF in the vasodilator actions of relaxin, it is not yet precisely clear what that role is. In nonvascular tissues, treatment with a range of compounds that increase cAMP levels also increases VEGF expression. So, in human endometrial cells, relaxin increases VEGF expression, and these effects are prevented by AC inhibition, and mimicked by either the AC activator forskolin or a PDE inhibitor (540), suggesting that increased cAMP production mediates increased VEGF transcription, and thus angiogenesis (FIGURE 9). However, in vascular tissues, the effects are less clear. Preincubation of rat or mouse renal arteries or human subcutaneous arteries with the VEGF receptor antagonist SU5416 blocks the vasorelaxant effects of relaxin (359), although the effects of SU5416 alone and its specificity can be questioned (17, 316). In other studies using rat renal arteries, SU5416 potentiated the vasodilator effects of relaxin (360). VEGF neutralizing antibodies also block the effects of relaxin, but this can be mimicked using placental growth factor antibodies (359), again making interpretation of the results difficult. It is possible that the antibodies by blocking the vasodilator effects of VEGF and PGF may produce physiological antagonism of the response to relaxin without necessarily being directly related to the primary mechanism of action.

Relaxin also acts directly on the heart. The presence of relaxin receptors (RXFP1) in the heart was first suggested by the demonstration of high-affinity binding sites for relaxin in rat atria (401, 402). Subsequently, in the same species, relaxin was shown to be one of the most powerful inotropic and chronotropic agents known (271). The positive chronotropic effects of relaxin occur in perfused intact hearts (36, 107, 531, 534) and isolated right atria (271, 350, 514, 553, 554), and the positive inotropic effects occur in left atria (271, 350, 514, 553, 554). The chronotropic effects of relaxin occur together with the secretion of atrial natriuretic peptide in isolated perfused rat hearts (534). In rat atrial myocytes, relaxin inhibits outward potassium currents, increases action potential duration, and enhances Ca²⁺ entry (417, 418). In rabbit sinoatrial node cells, relaxin caused increases in the rate of spontaneous action potentials and increased the L-type Ca²⁺ current (206) by a PKA-dependent mechanism. Until recently, these actions of relaxin on the heart were thought to be largely confined to rodents. However, a recent study (127) shows that relaxin has similar inotropic effects in human atria that are preserved in failing hearts and involves PKA, outward K⁺ currents, and PI3K. Interestingly, the effects of relaxin in the cardiovascular system, unlike the effects on reproduction, are not gender specific and are observed in both males and females. There is also evidence that relaxin protects against myocardial injury caused by ischemia and reperfusion (33). Pretreatment of rats with relaxin 30 min before 30 min of cardiac ischemia produced by ligating the left anterior descending coronary artery markedly reduced the size of the penumbra, and reduced cardiac arrhythmias, mortality as well as myeloperoxidase activity, malonyldialdehyde production, Ca²⁺ content as well as causing an improved morphology (33). Relaxin may be a naturally occurring cardioprotective agent, since in congestive heart failure the expression of human relaxin-1 and human relaxin-2 is increased in both atria and ventricles and the level of expression follows the degree of failure (132, 169) but is not a predictor of clinical outcomes (169).

5. Effects of relaxin-RXFP1 on connective tissue metabolism

The effects of relaxin on collagen synthesis and breakdown in reproductive tissues were the first biological effects of relaxin to be recorded (220). Since then it has become evident that relaxin has more general antifibrotic properties (47, 181), and a number of attempts have been made to put these to therapeutic use (462, 526–528, 538). One of the interesting aspects that has emerged is that the antifibrotic properties of relaxin are clearly seen only in disease conditions associated with excessive collagen deposition. Several studies have examined relaxin as a possible treatment for the connective tissue disease scleroderma. Although relaxin was shown to be safe and well-tolerated in clinical trials, and even effective in some patients in a phase II trial (462), it failed to show clinical efficacy in a larger scale phase III trial (149). In spite of these disappointing findings, there has been increasing evidence from animal studies that relaxin has a role in controlling collagen turnover. In relaxin knockout mice, there is a progressive increase in tissue fibrosis with age in male mice that is reversed in lung (444), kidney (445), and heart (443) by the administration of relaxin.

In the lung, TGF-β causes detrimental changes associated with fibrosis that are reversed by relaxin. Treatment with relaxin reduces expression of collagen types I and III and increases levels of MMPs (542). Antifibrotic effects were also produced in mice treated with bleomycin (542). In kidney-derived fibroblasts, relaxin displays similar effects on profibrotic changes induced by TGF-β and was shown to mediate these effects through the NO/guanylyl cyclase pathway that caused decreases in Smad2 phosphorylation and nuclear localization (FIGURE 10) (370). Relaxin also displays antifibrotic effects in a variety of rat renal models including fibrosis produced by bromoethylamine treatment (181), in an anti-glomerular basement membrane model (356), and in spontaneously hypertensive rats (307). In cardiac fibroblasts, relaxin reduces collagen type I and III expression and increases MMPs (443). In cardiac fibrosis produced by chronic stimulation of β-adrenoceptors by isoprenaline (585) or by cardiac-specific transgenic overexpression of β₂-adrenoceptors (44), relaxin administration or delivery via an adenovirus vector markedly reduced cardiac fibrosis.
In streptozotocin-treated mRen-2 rats (a model for diabetic cardiomyopathy), relaxin treatment reduced left ventricular collagen, myocardial stiffness, and diastolic dysfunction (440). This was associated with a significant decrease in TIMP-1 expression and an increase in extracellular matrix-degrading MMP-13 (440). However, in a chronic pressure overload model in mice, relaxin was ineffective (569), possibly because cardiac RXFP1 may be downregulated in this model or the serum concentrations of relaxin are insufficient to offset the extensive fibrosis. There is also good evidence supporting antifibrotic actions of relaxin in a number of models of liver fibrosis (54). Overall, the evidence suggests that relaxin may have useful antifibrotic properties in a number of pathological conditions.

In a recent study it has been shown that relaxin treatment of primary fibrochondrocytes increases the expression of mRNA for MMP-9 and MMP-13 and that the effect is mediated by RXFP1 and not RXFP2 receptors (4). Similar treatment caused activation of PI3K, Akt, PKC-$\zeta$, and ERK1/2 that could be blocked by the use of appropriate inhibitors that also blocked the induction of MMP-9. The effect of relaxin on MMP-9 expression was also blocked by prior transfection of a dominant negative form of Akt or by siRNA knockdown of ERK1/2, PKC-$\zeta$, Elk-1, c-fos, and to a minor extent NF$\kappa$B (4). This is one of the first studies that connects many of the known pathways of relaxin/RXFP1 signaling to a recognized response to relaxin treatment and provides insights that could be useful in translating the antifibrotic effects of relaxin into a clinical setting.

Relaxin also has beneficial effects in wound healing (92). This may involve the vasodilator effects mentioned above, but in addition, relaxin may hasten the synthesis of new blood vessels by enhancing the local production of VEGF (541).

### 6. Role of relaxin in the formation and spread of tumors

There is also now increasing evidence that relaxin is produced by cancer cells and can act in an autocrine manner on RXFP1 receptors expressed on these cells. To date, relaxin has been shown to be expressed by endometrial (273), mammary (522), thyroid (226), and prostate tumors (157, 532). There has long been an association of relaxin with breast cancer (reviewed in Refs. 26, 479), and relaxin treatment of breast cancer cells increases their invasive potential (59). Furthermore, elevated serum relaxin levels have been reported in breast cancer patients and in patients with metastases (60). It is possible that the relaxin produced by breast cancer cells is involved in tissue remodeling during breast cancer progression (60). Relaxin has also been associated with prostate cancer progression, and blocking the actions of relaxin or RXFP1 in rodent models of prostate cancer results in decreased cancer growth (see sect. VIIIA7).

### B. INSL3-RXFP2

INSL3 was isolated from a porcine testis cDNA library and designated Leydig insulin-like peptide (2). Murine INSL3 was independently cloned from a cDNA library of clones preferentially expressed in testicular tissue (424). INSL3 is a major secretory product of the prenatal and postnatal testicular Leydig cells in all species tested (2, 424). Detection of INSL3 expression in human cyclic corpus lutea put to rest suggestions that INSL3 expression is restricted to testis (521). Transcripts were subsequently detected in other tissues and species including ruminant ovary, uterus, and placenta (40, 432) as well as mouse (595) and marmoset ovary (583).

#### 1. Reproductive physiology: male

The development of INSL3 knockout mice enabled physiological functions to be attributed to the peptide (379, 596). INSL3 knockout mice develop normally, but male knockout mice are infertile and bilaterally cryptorchid, with the testis located high in the abdominal cavity adjacent to the kidney. There may also be torsion of the vas deferens and testicular artery and localization of the right testis in the contralateral position (379) likely due to a lack of attachment of the testis to the inguinal region by the gubernaculum and regression of the suspensory ligament. At birth, the size and histology of testes from knockout animals was normal but subsequently degenerated, and spermatozoa, and mature sperm were absent in adults. This is likely to be a temperature effect, since surgical reversal of cryptorchidism led to normal spermatogenesis in seminiferous tubules (384, 596).

The cryptorchid phenotype is not due to androgen deficiency, and INSL3 knockout males have serum testosterone levels similar to wild-type and heterozygous males (379) and apart from cryptorchidism have normal genitalia (596) and androgen-dependent behaviors (379). The gubernaculum in knockout mice is similar to that found in wild-type females. In vitro, coculture of explant gubernaculum from either wild-type or knockout mice, with the testis, induced growth of the gubernaculum (147), suggesting that INSL3 secreted by the testes is important for testicular descent.

Similarly cryptorchidism is the phenotype displayed in the white spotting ($crsp$) transgenic mouse which has a 550-bp deletion affecting the G protein-coupled receptor affecting testis descent (GREAT) (186, 406). This receptor (formerly LGR8) is now termed RXFP2, the cognate receptor for INSL3 (42). Since gubernacular cells undergo cell division in response to INSL3, both in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that the INSL3-RXFP2 system in male urogenital structures is essential for development of the gubernaculum during embryogenesis and for normal transabdominal testicular descent. A recent study has demonstrated that INSL3 signaling in the fetal gubernaculum both in vitro and

450 Physiol Rev · VOL 93 · JANUARY 2013 · [www.prv.org](http://www.prv.org)
RELAXIN FAMILY PEPTIDES AND THEIR RECEPTORS

in vivo involves genes that induce morphogenetic programs, including BMP and WNT signaling (266). Additionally, another study demonstrated that INSL3 signaling is essential for myogenic differentiation in the gubernaculum and involved genes in the Wnt/β-catenin and NOTCH pathways (270).

Transgenic mice overexpressing INSL3 were generated to further investigate the actions of INSL3 on the gubernaculum (3, 292). Females display ovaries positioned over the bladder, attached to the abdominal wall by well-developed craniosuspensory ligament (CSL) and gubernacula. Although this supported the idea that gubernacular development is an androgen-independent process, subsequent studies suggested otherwise (see below). In transgenic males, the pancreatic expression of INSL3 rescued the cryptorchid phenotype resulting from the deletion of the endogenous testicular INSL3 gene. Finally, in female INSL3 transgenic RXFP2 knockout mice, there is a wild-type phenotype, confirming that the actions of INSL3 on the gubernaculum are mediated by RXFP2 (65).

However, there is a suggestion that INSL3 alone is not sufficient for normal testicular descent. Normal testicular descent appears to rely on both INSL3-induced development of the gubernaculum and androgen-mediated cranial suspensory ligament regression (3, 375). Androgens have been shown to modulate RXFP2 expression in the gubernaculum. Androgens alone are insufficient to stimulate gubernacular cell proliferation but in combination with INSL3 have a proliferative effect, which is blocked by an RXFP2 antagonist or siRNA (580). In vivo, the RXFP2 antagonist blocked testosterone replacement therapy-induced testis descent in 50% of LH receptor knockout mice. Thus RXFP2 signaling appears to mediate the effects of androgens on the gubernaculum, which is important for the inguinoscrotal phase of testicular descent. This is particularly important as most human defects in testicular descent are associated with the inguinoscrotal phase (250).

Many early papers investigating the role of INSL3-RXFP2 in cryptorchidism emphasized the relevance of this ligand-receptor pair to cryptorchidism in humans. Cryptorchidism is the most common birth defect of the male genitalia, affecting 1–4% of live male births, with a greater incidence in premature infants (257). While the phenotype of INSL3 or RXFP2 knockout mice suggested that mutations in these genes could account for cryptorchidism in some infants, this is in fact highly unlikely. Some cryptorchid patients display polymorphisms in either INSL3 or RXFP2, but very few of these mutations confer a functional change in either the peptide or the receptor. Mutation detection analysis in genomic DNA samples from formerly cryptorchid patients identified two mutations in INSL3 (533). The first a nonsense mutation in the C-peptide region of pro-INSL3 (R49X) results in a nonfunctional peptide, and the second,

in the B chain (P69L) of the pro-INSL3 sequence results in a peptide with reduced activity (65). Similarly, of the four RXFP2 mutations identified in humans, only one is expected to alter receptor function. The T222P mutation in the fourth leucine-rich repeat is thought to result in a conformational change that interferes with ligand action (186), probably by inhibiting expression of mutant RXFP2 receptors at the cell surface (64). Recently, an N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea-induced mutation in mice that impaired testicular descent and reduced testis weight was found to be due to a mutation in leucine-rich repeat 8 (D294G) (209). Recombinant expression of the RXFP2D294G mutant showed reduced cell surface expression and a corresponding reduction in maximal cAMP response compared with wild type. Patients with the T222P mutation displayed heterogeneous phenotypes such as unilateral and bilateral cryptorchidism, retractile testis, normozoospermia, and complete azoospermia (186). All mutations of INSL3 and RXFP2 identified in cryptorchid patients have only been found in the heterozygous state. As the expression of INSL3 in testicular Leydig cells is exceptionally high, it is unlikely that a mutation in a single allele would be sufficient to induce bilateral cryptorchidism.

Nonetheless, there is evidence that the INSL3-RXFP2 system is affected in cryptorchid patients that have been exposed to environmental toxins. The use of diethylstilbestrol for hormonal support in pregnant women was terminated due to a high incidence of genital defects such as cryptorchidism in offspring (183). In mice, maternal exposure to estrogens, including 17α-and β-estradiol and diethylstilbestrol, downregulates expression of INSL3 in embryonic Leydig cells, and the gubernaculum fail to develop which results in cryptorchidism (380). Hence, it is possible that environmentally derived estrogens could cause cryptorchidism in humans by suppression of INSL3 expression in the fetal testis. Similarly, treatment of pregnant rats with phthalate esters reduces testicular INSL3 expression as a consequence of Leydig cell toxicity (97). As phthalates are used in a variety of products as plasticisers, humans in developed countries are substantially exposed, although, due to health concerns, their use is decreasing.

2. Reproductive physiology: female

INSL3 is produced in the ovary of all mammals predominantly in the thecal cells of the follicle (256). Female INSL3 knockout mice demonstrate impaired fertility associated with longer estrous cycle length, smaller litter sizes, accelerated follicular atresia and luteolysis, and premature loss of corpora lutea (379, 490). These phenotypes suggest that INSL3 inhibits follicular and luteal cells from entering the apoptotic pathway. In support of this, INSL3 expression in vivo varies with follicular development with levels greatest at the early antral stages and declining prior to expression of cholesterol side-chain cleavage cytochrome P-450 or 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase expression in the theca in-

terna as follicles enlarge or enter atresia (253). Thus thecal cell INSL 3 expression may be important in follicle selection in addition to being antiapoptotic.

In mouse ovaries, INSL 3 expression coincides with the appearance of growing follicles, and expression is higher in the follicular than the luteal phase (595). During pregnancy, INSL 3 mRNA is greatest during phases 1–3 of follicle development and decreases to its lowest levels between day 8 and 17 of pregnancy (595). Together, these results suggest that INSL 3 expression is correlated with follicular maturation.

In rats, INSL 3 may mediate the actions of gonadotropins in both female and male germ cells. In the mammalian ovary, oocytes show prolonged arrest at the prophase of meiosis I. The preovulatory surge in luteinizing hormone induces the resumption of meiosis in the oocyte, reprogramming of mural granulosa cells, expression of new mRNAs and proteins, and changes to the secretory properties of the cells surrounding the oocyte. Control of these factors is associated with the levels of cAMP in the oocyte (535). In rat ovary, expression of RXFP 2 is restricted to the oocyte, suggesting a similar paracrine function for the INSL 3-RXFP 2 system. LH also increases transcription of INSL 3 in ovarian theca cells, and binding of INSL 3 to RXFP 2 expressed in the oocyte leads to activation of G<sub>i</sub> and decreases in cAMP production (276). Studies in cultured preovulatory follicles from gonadotropin-treated female rats further indicated that INSL 3 causes meiotic progression of the arrested oocytes.

The ability of LH to regulate INSL 3 levels is supported by data from several other species and models, including humans (50), mice (159), and roe deer (229). INSL 3 may also be involved in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a common female endocrine disorder characterized by obesity, anovulation or amenorrhea, acne, and excessive production or enhanced effects of androgens. In normal women, INSL 3 levels are positively correlated with total testosterone, free androgen index, basal LH concentrations and hirsuitism score, and negatively correlated with frequency of menstruation (178). In patients with PCOS, circulating INSL 3 levels are associated with higher luteinizing hormone levels, increased basal and ovarian hyperandrogenemia and hirsutism score, worsened menstrual pattern, and higher mean ovarian follicle number. It is likely that in normal-weight women with PCOS, increased LH may be responsible for increased androgen secretion from ovarian tissues mediated by INSL 3 (178).

3. Neurophysiology

RT-PCR was used to demonstrate RXFP 2 expression in human brain (239), and in rats, in situ hybridization histochemistry showed RXFP 2 mRNA in numerous thalamic nuclei (469), including the parafascicular nucleus; the dor-

solateral, ventrolateral, and posterior thalamic nuclei; and the medial habenula (460). These sites correspond to the distribution of RXFP 2 determined by <sup>125</sup>I-INSL 3 binding (460).

In contrast, INSL 3 mRNA has only been detected in bovine hypothalamus by RT-PCR (40) and Northern blotting (41) and is not present in rodent brain (469). This may reflect the greater importance of INSL 3 in ruminants (40), which do not express relaxin (560). The ligand-receptor mismatch may support the proposal that RXFP 1 and RXFP 2 evolved as receptors for relaxin family peptides during mammalian evolution (561) and that prior to the emergence of INSL 3, there was a now defunct ligand-receptor pairing of which only RXFP 2 remains.

It is also possible that INSL 3 derived from testicular or ovarian cells crosses the blood-brain barrier to activate RXFP 2. Circulating INSL 3 levels are relatively high (9, 172) at ~1% of testosterone levels. However, INSL 3 infusions into rat brain suggest that RXFP 2 influences sensorimotor rather than gonadal function (460). It remains to be determined whether INSL 3 crosses the blood-brain barrier to activate RXFP 2.

4. Physiological functions of INSL 3-RXFP 2 in other tissues

Knowledge of other physiological functions of INSL 3 is based largely on the developmental pattern of INSL 3 and RXFP 2 expression in bone, tumors, and kidney.

INSL 3 levels vary throughout life and often closely mirror testosterone, which is also produced by the Leydig cells of the testis. During adulthood, Leydig cell function may be altered and INSL 3 levels decline in late-onset hypogonadism. In 25 young adult men with cryptorchid hypogonadism caused by the T222P mutation of RXFP 2, 64% had reduced bone density but normal plasma testosterone levels (162). RXFP 2 mRNA and protein are present in human osteoblast cells, and an osteoblast cell line responded to INSL 3 with a dose-dependent increase in cAMP. Like human, mouse osteoblasts express RXFP 2, but not INSL 3, and RXFP 2 knockout mice are osteopenic and have functional osteoblast impairment (162). This suggests that INSL 3 may have an endocrine role in bone physiology and that RXFP 2 mutations may be linked with osteoporosis in men. In cultured human osteoblasts (414), INSL 3 regulates the expression of genes necessary for proliferation and differentiation, matrix deposition, and osteoclastogenesis, in addition to dose-dependent proliferation. This correlates well with deficits in INSL 3-RXFP 2 signaling that are correlated with reduced bone mass (161, 162).

A role for INSL 3 in tumor biology has been suggested on the basis of expression of INSL 3 and a splice variant in human hyperplastic thyroid adenoma and thyroid cancer

(228). INSL3 is also present in human prostate carcinomas and increases motility in a human androgen-insensitive prostate carcinoma cell line PC-3 (286). More recently it has been demonstrated that all human thyroid adenomas, three types of human thyroid carcinoma tissues and mouse non-cancerous follicular epithelial cells of the thyroid express RXFP2 mRNA (225). In addition, thyroid cancer cells expressing INSL3 demonstrate enhanced motility and increased colony formation in vitro and enhanced tumour growth in vivo. Finally, the Ca²⁺ binding protein S100A4, which increases cancer cell mobility and enhances tumour tissue vascularization, is increased by INSL3, suggesting that S100A4 is a downstream target of RXFP2 signaling in thyroid cells (225).

RXFP2 mRNA expression is highest in rat kidney at late-stage gestation and decreases dramatically at birth with the lowest levels in adulthood (175). RXFP2 is expressed in mesangial cells in mature glomeruli and inhibits proliferation of cultured primary glomerular cells, suggesting that INSL3 and RXFP2 influence the genesis or maturation of renal glomeruli and regulate mesangial cell density (175). Podl is one of the main transcription factors involved in glomerulogenesis (425), and an E-box consensus sequence capable of binding Podl in conjunction with other helix loop helix transcription factors is located upstream of the gene for RXFP2 (176). Therefore, Podl may regulate expression of RXFP2 in the kidney during development to facilitate glomerular cell proliferation (155). RXFP2 expression levels in the embryonic kidney were significantly greater in Podl knockout mice than in heterozygous or wild-type controls, indicating that RXFP2 is downstream of Podl and Podl negatively regulates expression of RXFP2 in the glomeruli (155).

C. The Neuropeptide Relaxin-3 and Its Cognate Receptor RXFP3

1. The relaxin-3 and RXFP3 system

The endogenous receptor for relaxin-3 is believed to be RXFP3 on the basis of the coevolution of the ligand-receptor pair (561), the overlap of relaxin-3 fibers, and RXFP3 expression in the brain (FIGURE 6) (46, 80, 314, 332, 334, 486, 487, 516) and the pharmacological profile of RXFP3 which shows high affinity for relaxin-3 (314, 545, 546). However, at least pharmacologically, relaxin-3 may also interact with RXFP1 (501) and RXFP4 (313) and may also interact with RXFP2 in some species (453).

Relaxin-3 and RXFP3 expression is highest in the brain, leading to a focus on roles of this ligand-receptor pair in the CNS. Functional studies of relaxin-3-RXFP3 have been facilitated by the development of a chimeric peptide R3/I5 that activates RXFP3 and RXFP4 but not RXFP1 (312), and R3(BΔ23–27)R/I5, an antagonist with selectivity similar to the chimeric R3/I5 peptide (299) (see sect. IIC).

2. Role of the relaxin-3-RXFP3 system in stress

Relaxin-3 and RXFP3 are present in hypothalamic and extrahypothalamic regions involved in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (312, 329, 487, 508). Corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) is synthesized and released from the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) in response to stress. Interestingly, RXFP3 is abundantly expressed in the PVN, in addition to other regions commonly associated with stress and anxiety, including the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, lateral septum, periaqueductal gray, and the dorsal raphe (FIGURE 6) (312). The CRF₁ receptor mediates neural responses to CRF and most relaxin 3-containing neurons in the NI coexpress this receptor (506, 516). The concept that relaxin-3 modulates stress responses through interactions with CRF was investigated by ICV administration of CRF to rats. This caused activation of relaxin-3 containing neurons, and neurogenic stressors increased relaxin-3 mRNA in the NI (516). Furthermore, in NI neurons, relaxin-3 occurs in presynaptic vesicles. This is in accord with the concept that relaxin-3 released from nerve endings in the NI is involved in regulation of stress responses. Stress also transiently increases relaxin-3 mRNA in the rat brain following a forced swim stress paradigm (25). These effects were partly blocked by pretreatment with the CRF₁ antagonist antalarmin. While these studies demonstrate the influence of CRF and stress on relaxin-3, it is not yet clear whether relaxin-3 acting via RXFP3 influences the CRF system.

3. Role of the relaxin-3-RXFP3 system in feeding and metabolism

In the rodent, RXFP3 is expressed in the periventricular hypothalamic nucleus, PVN, and supraoptic nucleus (SON) (FIGURE 6) (486, 487), suggesting that the relaxin-3-RXFP3 system has a role in neuroendocrine and metabolic control. Human relaxin-3 given ICV to rats either in the early light or early dark phase, transiently but significantly increased food intake (358). This effect did not result from increased spontaneous activity or arousal. In addition, the orexigenic effects of relaxin-3 are likely mediated by RXFP3, and not RXFP1, since human relaxin-2 administration had no effect (358).

The role of the PVN in this response was investigated using acute and chronic human relaxin-3 infusions into the PVN, both of which increased food intake (357). Human relaxin-3 injection into the SON, arcuate nucleus (ARC), and anterior preoptic area (APOA) also transiently increased food intake. However, given that RXFP3 is not present in the ARC or APOA, it is unclear how relaxin-3 exerts its effects in these nuclei. Finally, ICV infusion of R3/I5 also increased food intake, and this effect was blocked by pretreatment of the antagonist R3(BA23–27)R/I5 (299). ICV administration of R3(BA23–27)R/I5 alone has no effect on food intake (509), suggesting that under resting
conditions there is minimal tone in the relaxin-3-RXFP 3 system.

Although relaxin-3 influences food intake, there is little evidence to suggest that infusion of the peptide increases body weight. In one study, chronic ICV human relaxin-3 did increase body weight (219), but other studies have failed to show weight changes following ICV or intrahypothalamic injection of relaxin-3 (357, 358). In rats, chronic ICV R3(BA23–27)R/I5 did not affect body weight (509). There is also limited evidence to suggest that body weight is influenced by endogenous relaxin-3. Although relaxin-3 knockout mice were initially reported to have lower body weights, this has not been replicated by other investigators (488, 509), suggesting that the decreased body weight may have been due to differences in control animals, housing, or diet. Alternatively, the chronic absence of relaxin-3 may be associated with compensation by other systems, whereas acute infusions of relaxin-3 could transiently increase food intake.

Several studies that investigated the effects of relaxin-3 infusion on feeding also measured blood hormone levels. Chronic ICV infusion of human relaxin-3 increased plasma leptin and insulin levels (219). Similarly, increases in leptin in ad libitum fed animals and TSH in ad libitum and pair-fed animals were observed with chronic infusion of human relaxin-3 into the PVN (357). These effects occurred in the absence of changes in energy expenditure.

Studies of the roles of relaxin-3 in neuroendocrine function and metabolism currently lack supporting mechanisms, which prevents the generation of concrete conclusions. More detailed studies are needed that examine the neural, signaling, and gene transcription changes that lead to the relaxin-3-induced feeding response. This may help to tease out confounding effects on reward, motivation, and arousal and determine whether there is a true feeding response to relaxin-3 stimulation.

### 4. The relaxin-3-RXFP 3 system in behavioral activation and arousal

Much of the evidence for a role for relaxin-3 in behavioral activation and arousal comes from the parallel study of the neuroanatomy of relaxin-3 projections and sites of RXFP 3 expression. Structures in the septohippocampal pathway of rodents are heavily innervated by relaxin-3-positive projections from the NI ([FIGURE 6]). One of the major functions of this pathway is the generation of hippocampal theta rhythm, which has oscillations at 4–12 Hz. Theta rhythm is controlled by pacemaker neurons of the medial septum (MS) and is involved in behaviors such as vigilance, exploration, orientation, navigation, locomotor control, and working memory. The NI has an important role in theta rhythm, and electrical stimulation of the nucleus causes theta rhythm in the hippocampus. On the other hand, le-

sions of the NI disrupt theta rhythm initiated by stimulation of the reticularis pontine oralis (390). RXFP 3 signaling also influences theta rhythm as in both anesthetized and conscious rats, RXFP 3 modulates neuronal activity in the hippocampus and MS to promote hippocampal theta rhythm (330). In behavioral studies, blockade of RXFP 3 in the MS with R3(BA23–27)R/I5 caused impaired performance in a paradigm that investigated theta rhythm-dependent spatial working memory. R3(BA23–27)R/I5 produced dose-dependent decreases in performance, which could be overcome by coadministration of R3/I5 (330).

The relaxin-3-RXFP 3 system also influences locomotor activity in some models of rodent behavior. Chronic ICV infusion of relaxin-3 had no effect on locomotor activity in male Wistar rats (219), whereas ICV infusions of R3/I5 increased locomotor activity, and R3(BA23–27)R/I5 had no effect (509). However, female relaxin-3 knockout mice were hypoactive in several paradigms including the locomotor cell, large open field, Y maze, and novel object tests (485). Whether these differences are due to gender or species remains to be determined.

Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) has well-established roles in cognitive, emotional, and behavioral control (reviewed in Ref. 106). Since the NI is located close to the dorsal raphe, a region enriched in 5-HT neurons, studies have been carried out examining the effects of 5-HT on relaxin-3 expression (367) and showed that most relaxin-3-containing neurons of the NI coexpress 5-HT1A receptors. Inhibition of 5-HT synthesis for 3 days increased relaxin-3 mRNA in the NI. More studies are needed to determine the relationship between changes in 5-HT levels and relaxin-3 expression.

### 5. Role of relaxin-3-RXFP 3 in fluid homeostasis

Unlike the relaxin-RXFP 1 system, the relaxin-3-RXFP 3 system is not expected to influence fluid homeostasis. However, administration of human relaxin-3 into the lateral ventricle causes drinking in rats, probably mediated by actions on RXFP 1 in the SFO (45). Recently, it was demonstrated that ICV relaxin-3 causes dose-dependent neuronal activation in the hypothalamus and several circumventricular organs including the SFO, SON, and PVN (405). While there is evidence for an interaction between relaxin-3 and RXFP 1 both in vitro and in vivo, there is no evidence that this occurs physiologically, or that relaxin-3 has actions on RXFP 3 located in the circumventricular organs.

Thus the relaxin-3-RXFP 3 system has a role in feeding, metabolism, stress, arousal, learning, and memory. While many of the hypotheses that have been developed on the basis of neuroanatomical data have been tested in rodent models, it is possible that the observed phenotypes do not reflect the primary functions of the relaxin-3-RXFP 3 system in humans. Identification of the effector molecules down-
RELAXIN FAMILY PEPTIDES AND THEIR RECEPTORS

stream of RXFP3 and the development of alternative in vivo models are important future steps in the validation of putative relaxin-3-RXFP3 functions.

D. INSL5 and RXFP4

RXFP4 (formerly GPCR142) was originally identified as a receptor for relaxin-3 (313). However, the dramatically different expression patterns of relaxin-3 and RXFP4 suggested that relaxin-3 was not the cognate ligand for RXFP4. Furthermore, unlike relaxin-3, RXFP4 is less well conserved and appears as a pseudogene in both rats and dogs, suggesting that RXFP4 may be the receptor for a ligand other than relaxin-3 in mammals. A related peptide, INSL5, is also a pseudogene in rats and dogs, and its expression pattern overlaps with RXFP4 leading to the suggestion that INSL5 was the ligand for RXFP4. Subsequently, INSL5 was demonstrated to be a high-affinity ligand for RXFP4 (315), and mRNA is present in a variety of human tissues including brain, kidney, testis, thymus, placenta, prostate, salivary gland, thyroid, and colon (315), many of which also coexpress INSL5. Overall, the receptor-ligand co-evolution, pharmacology, and similarities in expression profiles strongly indicate that RXFP4 is the endogenous receptor for INSL5.

Transgenic INSL5 knockout/LacZ knockout mice developed to investigate the physiology of INSL5 (260) showed β-galactosidase staining of tissues that confirmed the distribution of INSL5, with staining in the colon to a single dispersed cell population. Mice overexpressing the INSL5 gene under control of the metallothionein or insulin promoters have been produced, but there are no reports of any physiological or behavioral findings related to INSL5 function.

E. Cross-reactivity Between Relaxin Family Peptides and RXFP Receptors

1. Relaxin activates RXFP2 and RXFP3 in addition to RXFP1

While RXFP1 is the cognate receptor for relaxin, some species relaxins (including human relaxin-2) can also bind to and activate the INSL3 receptor RXFP2. Human relaxin-2 and porcine relaxin bind to RXFP2 with nanomolar affinity and cause cAMP accumulation (198, 199, 239, 301, 501). However, while these relaxins bind to RXFP2, they do so with an affinity lower than INSL3, and lower than that observed for their interaction with RXFP1, consistent with the designated relaxin-RXFP1 and INSL3-RXFP2 ligand-receptor pairings. Importantly both mouse and rat relaxin are unable to bind to or activate RXFP2 in vitro (45, 454), and this finding has been confirmed in vivo using transgenic animals (65, 158, 274). This suggests that the human relaxin-2 interaction with RXFP2 may be species specific (199).

While the original characterization of RXFP3 suggested a unique relaxin-3-selective binding and activation profile (314), a recent study also identifies binding and activation of RXFP3 by relaxin (545). This may reflect the fact that relaxin and INSL3 both retain homology within the domain of relaxin-3 that dictates RXFP3 binding (299, 545) (see sect.IIC). By examining a number of functional outputs (ERK1/2 phosphorylation, cAMP inhibition, and NFkB and AP-1 reporter gene activation), distinct patterns of cellular responses to relaxin-3, relaxin, and INSL3 were identified (545). Relaxin-3 activated the widest range of signaling pathways whereas relaxin and INSL3 activated only subsets of these (see sect.VIC). Detailed binding studies subsequently revealed that relaxin and INSL3 bind to a distinct site on RXFP3, whereas relaxin-3 competes for binding to RXFP3 with the ¹²⁵I-R3/I5 chimeric peptide, relaxin-3, relaxin, and INSL3 could all compete for RXFP3 binding with ¹²⁵I-relaxin (545). Thus not only does relaxin bind to and activate RXFP3 (in addition to RXFP1 and RXFP2), but RXFP3 displays ligand-biased signaling, with the pattern of cellular responses generated by this receptor being highly dependent upon the ligand and on the cellular background.

2. Relaxin-3 activates RXFP1, RXFP2, and RXFP4 in addition to RXFP3

Prior to the discovery of a unique receptor for relaxin-3, it was defined by its ability to bind to and activate RXFP1, but with a lower affinity than relaxin (46). This property, in conjunction with the inability of relaxin-3 to bind human RXFP2, was subsequently exploited to describe a second binding site for relaxin-3 within the second extracellular loop of RXFP1 (501). This two-site binding model has since been shown to be a general characteristic of relaxin family peptide binding to both RXFP1 and RXFP2 (199, 210) (see sect.IIIB). Although relaxin-3 does not bind and activate human RXFP2, it has been demonstrated to weakly bind to and activate rat RXFP2 (453).

The identification of RXFP3 as the cognate receptor for relaxin-3 (314) also led to the subsequent deorphanization of RXFP4 (the INSL5 receptor) (313), based on the high degree of similarity between the two receptors and the ability of relaxin-3 to bind to and activate both receptors. RXFP4 (human, monkey, bovine, porcine, and mouse) was found to bind relaxin-3 with high affinity (98). Binding of relaxin-3 to RXFP4 also caused cellular responses similar to RXFP3, with inhibition of AC, increased GTPγS binding, and increased intracellular calcium when RXFP4 is co-expressed with Gaα₁₆ (98, 313, 315).

3. Interaction between INSL5 and RXFP3

Although RXFP4 was initially defined by its ability to bind relaxin-3 (313), it was subsequently reclassified as the cog-

imate receptor for INSL5 (315). Based on the existing cross-reactivity between many of the relaxin family peptides and their receptors, the activity of INSL5 at all the relaxin family receptors was subsequently assessed. Although INSL5 does not bind to RXFP1 or RXFP2, it does bind to RXFP3, albeit with lower affinity than relaxin-3 (315). However, INSL5 is an antagonist of responses to relaxin-3 (315). It is not currently known if the peptide is a neutral antagonist, inverse agonist, or biased-ligand. The lack of binding affinity of INSL5 at RXFP1 or RXFP2 has been exploited in the generation of the chimeric peptide (R3/I5) that is routinely used to distinguish RXFP3 and RXFP4 binding sites from those for RXFP1.

**VIII. POTENTIAL THERAPEUTIC APPLICATIONS FOR DRUGS TARGETING RXFP RECEPTORS**

A. RXFP1: A Promising Therapeutic Target

The long-established effects of relaxin on the adaptive changes to pregnancy in women, in addition to its emerging role in cardiovascular homeostasis, are the main targets of current efforts in relaxin-RXFP1-based therapeutics. In addition, other physiological consequences of relaxin-RXFP1 interaction constitute additional, appealing therapeutic targets for future investigation.

1. Promotion of cervical ripening by relaxin

There is substantial experimental evidence for a role for relaxin and RXFP1 in cervical ripening and parturition (47). Based on this evidence, relaxin has been tested for its ability to cause similar changes in women. Despite evidence for cervical ripening in humans following application of porcine relaxin (152, 339), there has been no demonstration of efficacy for human relaxin-2. Studies failed to show efficacy of topically applied human relaxin-2, although this may have been confounded by its low penetration into cervical tissue (52). Thus, despite demonstrated efficacy in promoting cervical ripening for human relaxin-2 application to the common marmoset monkey (481), a similar role in women is still uncertain. Despite this uncertainty, relaxin may yet prove to be a useful adjunct in parturition, with studies suggesting that both maternal and fetal relaxin may contribute to rupture of the fetal membrane, particularly in instances of premature birth (523).

2. Facilitation of implantation by relaxin

A principal role of relaxin, initially described in pregnant guinea pigs (220), involves the preparation of the birth canal for parturition. Although the evidence for the hormonal actions of relaxin is clear in rodents and some mammals, it is of reduced importance in higher species. In women, maximum circulating levels of relaxin occur during the first trimester of pregnancy (51, 138, 497), which is in direct contrast to other species, such as rats (14, 108, 472) and pigs (15, 53), where maximum circulating levels of relaxin occur during the third trimester (393).

Due to the timing of this peak of circulating relaxin in humans, the role of relaxin and RXFP1 in pregnancy is more likely associated with first trimester physiological events such as embryo implantation. Indeed, relaxin can interact with RXFP1 expressed on endometrial and stromal cells, inducing cAMP accumulation and the production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) to cause decidualization and preparation of the endometrium for implantation (529, 540). More specifically, the identification of the location and regulation of RXFP1 expression in the human endometrium has supported a role for relaxin in the implantation process: relaxin receptor binding in the uterus is dramatically increased just prior to, and peaks immediately after, ovulation (67). This mirrored earlier studies monitoring plasma relaxin levels in conception and nonconceptive female cycles (497). Relaxin also promotes follicle development in the human, as relaxin treatment of human ovarian cortical tissue caused a significant increase in secondary follicles and a decrease in primordial follicles, in addition to causing increased vascularization of endometrial tissue and thickening of the endometrium in preparation for implantation (474). In the macaque, relaxin treatment has been shown to assist in vitro fertilization due to improvements in endometrial thickening and embryo implantation (214). Thus the relaxin-RXFP1 system is an attractive candidate to assist in implantation.

3. Relaxin treatment for the prevention of preeclampsia

Preeclampsia commonly occurs during pregnancy and describes the reduced blood flow to the placenta leading to systemic vasoconstriction, hypertension, renal dysfunction, and ultimately multiple organ failure. Currently, symptoms are usually relieved by preterm delivery of the fetus. Recent studies suggest that the vasoconstriction that defines preeclampsia may result from inhibition of factors such as VEGF (308, 353, 593). There is preclinical evidence that suggests that relaxin may be a useful treatment for preeclampsia. In the clinical trials for the treatment of scleroderma, relaxin administration was associated with menorrhagia and metrorrhagia in a large number of women (540), consistent with angiogenic and vasodilatory effects, and likely due to increased VEGF expression and secretion in human endometrial cells (408, 540). In the same study, relaxin administration also decreased systolic and diastolic blood pressure, consistent with a vasodilatory effect, and improved renal function, suggesting that relaxin treatment may relieve maternal symptoms of preeclampsia (538). Relaxin is currently being assessed as a treatment for preeclampsia.

4. Relaxin as a novel treatment for congestive heart failure

Relaxin is now emerging as a potential novel treatment for acute congestive heart failure (526). The well-established effects associated with relaxin during pregnancy including increased cardiac output, blood vessel compliance, and renal blood flow (265), together with studies that show positive inotropic and chronotropic effects on the heart (127, 271) and the observation that relaxin plasma levels increase in heart failure (132), suggested that it may have beneficial effects (reviewed in Ref. 135). In congestive heart failure, the heart fails to pump enough blood to perfuse vital organs. It is often associated with increased blood pressure, and mortality is highly correlated with declining renal function and increased activity of the sympathetic nervous system. Thus the ability of relaxin to induce vasodilation and improve renal function in pregnancy, which was reflected in the previous clinical trials for scleroderma (149, 527), has suggested that the peptide may prove useful in the treatment of heart failure.

In a phase I clinical trial examining the safety and dose-response relationship of short-term infusion of relaxin on hemodynamics in patients with congestive heart failure, administration resulted in increased cardiac output and decreased systemic vascular resistance and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (133). Phase II clinical trials have since been completed; the multicenter, placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized, international trial (Pre-RELAX-AHF) assessed the effects of intravenous relaxin administration in patients with acute heart failure (526). Despite no significant improvement in renal function, relaxin was associated with a small but significant improvement in self-reported breathlessness, and there was improvement in the incidence of cardiovascular death and readmission (526). Administration of the peptide was also associated with a trend towards clinical improvement of heart failure and a reduced requirement for diuretics. These studies again supported the safety of relaxin administration as a therapeutic and confirmed the vasodilatory effects of relaxin in patients with heart failure (133, 526). Thus there is promising scope for the use of relaxin to improve patient outcomes following congestive heart failure, especially in conditions of cardiac fibrosis. The peptide is currently undergoing phase III clinical trials (RELAX-AHF-1) (421).

5. Antihypertensive effects of relaxin

Relaxin also exerts a local influence on the circulation by increasing vasodilation and passive compliance: both relaxin and RXFP1 mRNA have been identified in thoracic aortas, small renal arteries, and mesenteric arteries in both rats and mice (388). Several studies suggest that relaxin exerts these local effects through the synthesis and production of NO, particularly in situations of natural or induced myocardial infarction (33, 154, 343, 346). This is supported by studies in the relaxin-knockout mouse, which demonstrated blunted NO-dependent myogenic reactivity (388). Relaxin also induces vasodilation in human systemic resistance arteries in vitro (170). The vasodilation of gluteal resistance arteries was endothelium dependent (170) and substantially inhibited in arteries from patients being treated with ACE inhibitors. Inhibition of cyclooxygenase (indomethacin) or soluble guanylyl cyclase (ODQ-4M) also greatly reduced the vasodilator response to relaxin (171). In addition to these direct vasodilator effects of relaxin, recent evidence also suggests that relaxin treatment reverses the arterial remodeling that is a characteristic feature in spontaneously hypertensive rats with age and improves large artery compliance (568). Thus the actions of relaxin on connective tissue metabolism may also contribute to the long-lasting effects of a relatively short period of relaxin treatment.

In clinical studies assessing the potential efficacy of relaxin in the treatment of scleroderma, the peptide caused a significant decrease in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure, that was consistent with vasodilation (528). Clinical trials investigating relaxin as a treatment for congestive heart failure also demonstrated decreased blood pressure (134, 526).

6. Antifibrotic effects of relaxin

One of the physiological effects of relaxin with broad therapeutic potential is its effects on connective tissue regulation and fibrosis. From a therapeutic viewpoint, relaxin decreases excess collagen deposition in fibrotic lesions, with a conservation of endogenous connective tissue structure (181, 542). Relaxin also exerts anti-inflammatory effects, can inhibit the activation of human neutrophils by pro-inflammatory agents (345), and prevents histamine and granule release by activated basophils (29) and mast cells (344). In an animal model of allergic airway disease, there was increased collagen deposition and decreased expression of MMP9 in relaxin-knockout animals compared with controls (371), although these studies demonstrated receptor involvement only in airway fibrosis homeostasis and not during the inflammation-induced fibrosis associated with chronic allergic airway disease (441). Taken together, relaxin is protective during the allergic inflammatory response. In rodent models of angiogenesis and wound healing, relaxin caused increased vascularization and neoangiogenesis of ischemic wound sites (309, 541) but had no effect on cytokine expression in cells taken from nonwound sites (541), indicating promising specificity for therapeutic applications.

7. Roles of relaxin in cancer

As discussed in the previous section, relaxin appears to be recruited in many types of cancer cells as an endogenous factor for tissue remodeling. In particular, relaxin is associated with prostate cancer progression, and increased expression of relaxin (but not RXFP1) occurs in prostate carcinomas and prostate cancer cell lines (157, 532, 549). Importantly, downregulation of either relaxin or RXFP1 caused significant inhibition of growth (549) and invasiveness, in addition to increased apoptosis (157) in rodent prostate cancer models. Furthermore, lentiviral driven expression of an RXPF1 peptide antagonist within prostate tumors in a mouse model of human prostate cancer suppressed tumor growth, whereas control lentiviruses had no effect (480). Hence, drugs that block relaxin action in prostate cancer may be an effective means to slow prostate cancer progression. Furthermore, relaxin is associated with increased invasiveness of endometrial (273), breast (59, 60), and thyroid (226) carcinomas, suggesting that agents blocking relaxin action may be used for the possible treatment of multiple cancers.

B. RXFP2 and Its Potential as a Therapeutic Target

INSL3 and its cognate receptor RXFP2 are clearly key regulators of the reproductive system in both male and female mammals. Apart from reproductive tissues, thyroid and bone are the only other major tissues to express the peptide and receptor. There is also good evidence for RXFP2 expression in brain, but no studies to date have provided evidence for the expression of INSL3 in either laboratory animals or humans.

1. RXFP2 as a target for modulation of fertility

The major physiological effects of the INSL3/RXFP2 system are on the reproductive system: lack of either INSL3 or RXFP2 in males results in cryptorchidism (379, 596), and overexpression of INSL3 in females causes ovarian descent and bilateral inguinal hernia (490). INSL3 stimulation of RXFP2 in germ cells causes meiotic progression of arrested oocytes in preovulatory follicles and suppresses male germ cell apoptosis (276). However, it is likely that targeting RXFP2 in the gubernaculum in utero would not be a useful therapeutic strategy, and indeed, most male babies with cryptorchidism are treated surgically. However, modulation of fertility is an attractive therapeutic option for the INSL3-RXFP2 system. Activation of RXFP2 expressed on germ cells suppresses male germ cell apoptosis (276), whereas injection into rat testis of an INSL3-based antagonist targeting RXFP2 led to a significant decrease in testis weight, consistent with inhibition of spermatogenesis (121). Furthermore, in a study examining a male hormonal contraceptive regime (involving administration of testosterone

one with a progestagen over 6 mo), those patients with persistent sperm production had higher serum INSL3 levels, suggesting again that the INSL3-RXFP2 system plays a role in spermatogenesis (8). Thus it is tempting to speculate that an INSL3-based antagonist targeting RXFP2 could be an effective male contraceptive agent. Additionally, INSL3 in females is associated with oocyte maturation and follicular development, and therefore, INSL3 may be effective for certain types of female infertility.

2. Other potential therapeutic applications of RXFP2

Interestingly, in a manner similar to relaxin, the INSL3-RXFP2 system has been shown to be present in human prostate carcinoma cell lines and human thyroid carcinomas, and treatment of these cell lines with INSL3 caused increased tumor cell motility (225, 286, 429). Another study suggests that INSL3 and RXFP2 may also have a role in osteoporosis (162). Thus there may be further therapeutic potential for this ligand-receptor system in pathologies including cancer and osteoporosis in the future.

C. RXFP3 as a Target for the Control of Anxiety and Food Intake

The development of therapeutics based on the relaxin-3-RXFP3 system is currently at the proof of concept stage. Much of what we know about the functions of the relaxin-3-RXFP3 system is based on a small number of anatomical, pharmacological, and genetic interference studies in rodent models. In addition, expression of RXFP3 has only been detected in human tissue by RT-PCR. However, relaxin-3 has recently been detected in the macaque by both in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry, suggesting that the relaxin-3-RXFP3 system may also be present in humans (332).

Nonetheless, there is substantial interest in the therapeutic potential of the relaxin-3-RXFP3 system. In general, GPCRs are attractive drug targets due to cell surface expression and thus good drug accessibility (particularly hydrophilic drugs) and selectivity due to the distribution of expression in different tissues and cell types. In addition, GPCRs are often responsible for maintaining physiological homeostasis by modulating the actions of neuropeptides and neurotransmitters. As the receptor of a neuropeptide, RXFP3 is particularly appealing. Many neuropeptides are colocated with neurotransmitters and act synergistically with them to modulate their actions. Thus neuropeptide receptors provide a unique opportunity to influence systems with less dramatic consequences than interfering with amino acid transmitters themselves. Since relaxin-3 is produced in GABAergic neurons of the nucleus incertus, it likely acts in concert with GABA signaling. In this way, it may be possible to fine-tune the GABAergic system by targeting RXFP3. This section focuses on the physiological functions of the

RELAXIN FAMILY PEPTIDES AND THEIR RECEPTORS

relaxin-3 and RXFP 3 system and how this may be manipulated for therapeutic purposes.

1. The relaxin-3-RXFP 3 system as a target for antianxiety drugs

The relaxin-3-RXFP 3 system is clearly implicated in the regulation of the stress response. As previously mentioned (see sect. VIIC), the great majority of relaxin 3-containing neurons in the NI express CRF-R1 (422). Additionally, the principal site of CRF production in the brain, the PVN, also expresses RXFP 3 (516). In rats, relaxin-3 neurons are activated by CRF administration, and expression of relaxin-3 in the NI is increased in response to swim stress (516). Similarly, repeat forced swim has been demonstrated to increase relaxin-3 expression, while pretreatment with the CRF-RI antagonist antalarmin attenuated the response (25). Currently, the physiological response to elevated relaxin-3 expression, the signals necessary to stimulate relaxin-3 release, and the influence of stress on RXFP 3 signaling are unknown. From neuroanatomical data, it appears that RXFP 3 could be part of a feedback system that regulates continued CRF release following stress; however, this has yet to be demonstrated experimentally. While these questions remain, the potential therapeutic application of RXFP 3 modulators for the stress system remains unrealised.

2. Modulation of feeding by the relaxin-3-RXFP 3 system

A role for the relaxin-3-RXFP 3 system in energy homeostasis has been suggested by studies of peptide infusion into the brain, which demonstrate effects of relaxin-3 on body weight, food intake, and plasma hormone levels. Chronic ICV human relaxin-3 has been reported to increase body weight (219), although other studies showed no change in body weight after ICV or intrahypothalamic nuclei injection of relaxin-3 (357, 358).

Although the evidence for a role for relaxin-3 in body weight control is equivocal, there are indications that the peptide may influence food intake. Initially this was prompted by the identification of RXFP 3 expression in the hypothalamus (312, 329, 508). In this context, human relaxin-3 administered ICV to rats either in the early light or early dark phase transiently increased food intake (219), and acute or chronic human relaxin-3 infusion into the PVN also increased food intake (357). Other hypothalamic nuclei, such as the SON, ARC, and APOA, may also be involved, as food intake was transiently increased by human relaxin-3 injection into these regions. However, given that RXFP 3 is not present in the ARC or APOA, it is unclear how relaxin-3 exerts its effects at these sites. However, ICV infusion of the RXFP 3 agonist R3/I5 also increased food intake, and this effect was blocked by preadministration of

the RXFP 3 antagonist R3(BA23–27)R/I5 (299). Interestingly, chronic ICV administration of R3(BA23–27)R/I5 had no effect on feeding, but significantly increased body weight (509). Studies in relaxin-3 knockout mice have provided equivocal data for a role of the relaxin-3-RXFP 3 system in body weight control, with one study describing a smaller leaner phenotype (509) whereas another (using the same knockout mice) failed to demonstrate any differences (485).

Several studies that investigated effects of relaxin-3 infusion on feeding also measured blood hormone levels. Chronic ICV human relaxin-3 increased plasma leptin and insulin levels (219), and chronic infusion of human relaxin-3 into the PVN increased leptin and decreased TSH in ad libitum-fed rats (357). These effects were observed in the absence of changes in energy expenditure. The levels of plasma endocrine factors were also measured in the chronic RXFP 3 agonist and antagonist studies conducted in rats. Chronic administration of the RXFP 3 agonist R3/I5 significantly increased insulin, leptin, adiponectin, testosterone, and angiotensinogen levels and decreased growth hormone levels (509). Infusion of the RXFP 3 antagonist R3(BA23–27)R/I5 also decreased growth hormone levels. Relaxin-3 knockout mice at 10–15 wk have reduced leptin and at 30–35 wk reduced insulin and leptin (509).

Given the lack of consistent evidence and the numerous hypothalamic neurotransmitter and peptidergic systems that regulate energy balance, it is difficult to assess the potential of the relaxin-3-RXFP 3 system as a drug target. Although relaxin-3 administration increases food intake in rodents, this effect is also seen in regions lacking RXFP 3, questioning its specificity. Infusions of R3(BA23–27)R/I5 are only effective in inhibiting relaxin-3 stimulated, but not basal food intake. The results suggest that the complex regulation of energy homeostasis by the CNS is difficult to override by manipulation of a single neuropeptide/receptor system. Nevertheless, evidence from rodent models suggests that RXFP 3 agonists and antagonists may influence energy homeostasis in a manner that may be useful for the treatment of human metabolic conditions such as anorexia, cachexia, and obesity.

IX. MAJOR UNANSWERED QUESTIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS

A. Signaling Paradigms

1. Role of signalosomes in relaxin family peptide receptor signaling

The recent demonstration that the expression of RXFP 1 receptors in cells induces the formation of signalosomes that are constitutively active and highly sensitive to attomolar concentrations of relaxin adds a new dimension to re-

Physiol Rev • VOL 93 • JANUARY 2013 • www.prv.org 459

laxin signaling (see sect. VIA). A particularly interesting feature of the RXFP1-signalosome is that attomolar concentrations of relaxin stimulate small increases in cAMP, whereas nanomolar concentrations preferentially activate the classical pathways involving $G\alpha_s$, $G\alpha_{oB}$, and $G\alpha_{i3}$ **(FIGURE 7A)**. Importantly, these pathways appear to act quite independently, and there is no effect of inhibitors of classical pathway-specific proteins (including $G\alpha_{io}$, PI3K and PKC) on cAMP generated in response to subpicomolar concentrations of relaxin. Equally there is no effect of inhibition of signalosome-specific proteins (including AC2, AKAP79, and $\beta$-arrestin 2) upon classical relaxin cAMP signaling **(FIGURE 7A)**. Furthermore, higher concentrations of relaxin are associated with dissociation of the signalosome, which is followed by activation of the classical signaling pathways. The pathways also generate cAMP in quite distinct regions of the cell. Thus signalosome-specific AC2 is known to be preferentially excluded from lipid-rich domains (565), whereas activation of the $G\alpha_{i3}$ pathway with nanomolar relaxin concentrations depends on lipid-rich domains in HEK293 cells (204). Since AC2 expression occurs predominantly in brain, lung, skeletal muscle, heart, and uterine myometrium (438, 565), it is likely that there are both tissues that display RXFP1 signalosome signaling and those that do not which may help to determine the physiological role of signalosome-localized RXFP1. It is interesting to note that previous studies of the regulation of RXFP1 expression by estrogens showed marked differences between tissues, and receptor expression was markedly upregulated in uterus but not affected in brain or heart (515). The scaffolding of AC2 to RXFP1 is highly dependent on AKAP79 that is known to scaffold many other proteins including other GPCRs, PKC, several ion channels, and a number of AC isoforms (see Ref. 196). The activity of AC isoforms may be variably influenced by interaction with AKAP79 and AC2 activity is inhibited (142), although this appears to be primarily offset in RXFP1 signalosomes by the scaffolding of RXFP1 and AC2. The regulatory complex of RXFP1, $\beta$-arrestin-2, and PDE4D3 also has some unusual features that call into question some of the current paradigms concerning the role of $\beta$-arrestins in receptor desensitization and internalization. While the $\beta_2$-adrenoceptor is phosphorylated by GRK-2 following receptor activation and subsequently becomes a substrate for $\beta$-arrestin-2 which triggers formation of clathrin-coated vesicles and internalization (for review, see Ref. 328), $\beta$-arrestin-2 clearly has a different role with RXFP1. The interaction between RXFP1 and $\beta$-arrestin-2 is constitutive and does not involve receptor activation or phosphorylation and does not appear to be involved in desensitization (201). Although this interaction involves S704 of RXFP1 (201), this residue does not appear to be phosphorylated, and indeed, exposure of RXFP1 to higher concentrations of relaxin fails to cause phosphorylation, desensitization, or internalization of the receptor (87, 514). It seems likely that in this case $\beta$-arrestin-2 acts solely as a scaffold for the formation of the regulatory com-

plex and has no role in receptor desensitization or internalization.

It is interesting to speculate whether the constitutive activity of the RXFP1 signalosome complex provides signaling that regulates expression of proteins necessary for signalosome formation or indeed the conventional relaxin signaling pathways. It will also be of interest to determine whether it is the specific activation of lipid raft-based signaling pathways that provides the stimulus for the dissociation of the RXFP1 signalosomes. More overt physiological applications of this highly sensitive, concentration-dependent signalosome are not yet clear. However, it is well recognized in humans that relaxin has a role during embryo implantation where it is required to exert its effects over an extended period of time, exemplified by endometrial decidualization which is crucial for embryo implantation and the maintenance of pregnancy. It has been demonstrated that endometrial decidualization is dependent on both circulating and locally produced relaxin (146, 214, 409, 540) and requires the maintained elevation of cAMP (reviewed in Ref. 529). Thus signalosome relaxin signaling may provide a mechanism that provides a physiological, perhaps homeostatic, role for the low concentrations of peptide present in the circulation, and thus may be linked to some of the long-term physiological effects. Future research, perhaps utilizing relaxin knockout models or single-cell models of physiologically relevant targets (i.e., atrial cardiomyocytes, endometrial cells, fibroblasts, or neurons), will be required to fully elucidate the downstream consequences and physiological significance of this ultrasensitive cAMP signaling pathway.

### 2. Role of LDLa modules in RXFP1 and RXFP2 signaling

Relaxin family peptides interact with RXFP1 and RXFP2 in a complex manner (see sect. VI, A and B). Not only do the peptides bind to the receptors in the LRR region and in ECL2, but also activation of signaling requires the presence of an intact LDLa module at the NH$_2$ terminus. A splice variant of RXFP2 that lacks the LDLa module or an engineered RXFP1 equivalent has binding properties similar to the intact receptor but do not produce a cAMP response to either INSL3 or relaxin, respectively (456). Also, the addition of a soluble form of RXFP1 LDLa to cells expressing RXFP1 inhibits the cAMP response to relaxin. Thus the activation of the cAMP signaling pathway by relaxin involves at least three events: high-affinity binding to the LRR region, binding to a secondary site on ECL2, and the involvement of the LDLa module. The precise mechanism whereby the LDLa module activates signaling is not known, although several features of the region are essential for activity. The RXFP1 LDLa has three disulfide bonds formed by six conserved cysteines and mutations of these bonds cause loss of the cAMP response. These three disulfide bonds are thought to provide the structural integrity neces-

RELAXIN FAMILY PEPTIDES AND THEIR RECEPTORS

sary for four acidic residues (N26, D30, D36, and E37) to form a correctly folded cage that ligates a Ca²⁺ essential for activity (231). However, other specific residues are also necessary for activity, since swapping of the RXFP1 LDLa for the LB2 domain of the LDLR that has high structural and sequence similarity does not produce a functional receptor. Site-directed mutagenesis of RXFP1 has identified L7, Y9, L22, and L23 as residues that influence the activity of the LDLa region, and mutations of these residues generate receptors that display reduced potency in response to relaxin. Some gain-of-function studies have been completed that indicate that substitution of the first nine residues of LB2 with those of the RXFP1 LDLa restores some cAMP responsiveness; however, the profile required to restore full activity has yet to be determined.

All of the current studies have examined whether particular structural features of the LDLa module are associated with cAMP production, but perhaps given the pleiotropic nature of RXFP1 signaling, it would also be worth examining if all signaling pathways are affected. Conceivably the conformations of RXFP1 associated with cAMP signaling may require the LDLa contribution but could differ from conformations that result in the activation of other pathways. Several models have been proposed to explain the role of the LDLa module in signaling. One involves a receptor monomer with the LDLa module interacting with the TM regions of the receptor to induce conformations that promote efficient interaction with G proteins and signaling. In this and alternative models, the LDLa acts as a tethered ligand. An additional model suggests that the LDLa may have a role in the formation of receptor dimers and in this case interacts with the dimerization partner. Both models at present lack substantial evidence to support or challenge their credibility. What is known is that the LDLa modules on their own or in combination with an LDLa-less receptor do not signal, so the link between the LDLa module and the receptor is essential.

3. **Dimerization of relaxin family peptide receptors: does it occur and what is the functional role?**

There is evidence to suggest that both RXFP1 (282, 511) and RXFP2 (510) form homodimers and heterodimers (510). The BRET signal is saturable but is not affected by the addition of the cognate ligand (human relaxin-2 for RXFP1; INSL3 for RXFP2). It is likely that dimerization primarily involves the 7-TM region of RXFP2 since a construct (RXFP2-TM1-7-GFP²) that lacks the extracellular domain of the receptor and hence the primary ligand binding site still forms dimers with RXFP2-RLuc. It has been suggested that dimer formation is necessary for signal transduction with ligand binding occurring at the LRR region of one dimer partner followed by interaction of the bound ligand with the ECL2 of the second partner and initiation of signaling (510). However, at present, there are no experiments with two inactive mutant receptor dimer partners

that show complementation and demonstrate rescue of function by dimerization to support this concept. It has also been suggested that dimer formation may explain apparent negative cooperativity observed with both RXFP1 and RXFP2. With both receptors, the rate of dissociation following incubation of cells expressing either receptor with either radiolabeled human relaxin-2 or INSL3 was determined after allowing the system to equilibrate and then undergo infinite dilution in the absence or presence of unlabeled ligand. The presence of unlabeled ligand was associated with modest increases in the rate of dissociation, suggesting negative cooperativity where the binding of ligand to each receptor is associated with a decrease in affinity of the remaining unoccupied receptors. It should be borne in mind, however, that such behavior does not necessarily reflect the formation of dimers (93), and studies are required utilizing receptors that retain function but are unable to form dimers or on receptors expressed in model phospholipid bilayers that allow examination of their functional characteristics when in monomeric form (548, 559).

4. **Bell-shaped concentration-response relationships: explanation and relevance to clinical actions**

A commonly observed characteristic of concentration-response curves to relaxin mediated by RXFP1 is that they are bell-shaped. These include cAMP responses in HEK293 cells transfected with RXFP1 (198); endometrial glandular epithelial cells (96); increases in L-type Ca²⁺ current in rabbit sinoatrial node cells (206); MMP1 expression in human lung fibroblasts (542); changes in glomerular filtration rate, renal plasma flow, renal vascular resistance, and plasma osmolality (112); as well as effects on dyspnea and survival in the phase II clinical trial of relaxin in cardiac failure (526). Similar findings have been reported for RXFP2 for cAMP accumulation (198) and negative cooperativity (510).

Although the phenomenon of bell-shaped concentration-response curves has been well described, there are no clear explanations, even though the clinical findings suggest that a better understanding of the process will be necessary to gain the optimum therapeutic benefit from relaxin treatment. One mechanism that has been suggested to explain the curves is negative cooperativity associated with receptor dimerization (510, 511). This would argue that increases in ligand concentration and receptor occupancy would reduce the affinity of the receptor for further interactions. However, one might expect in these circumstances that RXFP1 and RXFP2, receptors that both display negative cooperativity, would exhibit bell-shaped concentration-response curves. However, this does not appear to be the case as cAMP accumulation in response to activation of RXFP1 at 3 or 30 min or RXFP2 at 30 min display bell-shaped curves, whereas RXFP2 at 3 min does not (198). It could be argued that the RXFP2 system at 3 min is not in equilibrium and the effect of increasing receptor occupation balances out the

Physiol Rev · VOL 93 · JANUARY 2013 · www.prv.org 461

reduced receptor affinity. However, this does not convinc-
ingly explain the difference between RXFP1 and RXFP2 at
the same time point. The different patterns are unlikely to
be related to a different time course of receptor coupling to
G proteins as this occurs rapidly after receptor activation
(198). Alternatively, the decrease in response with higher
concentrations of peptide could be due to desensitization
and/or internalization of the receptor. For RXFP1, this is an
unlikely explanation. Even in early functional experiments
examining relaxin responses in target tissues such as the
heart, the maximum responses were maintained for over 6h
even with regular washing of the tissue (514), and more
recent studies showed no significant receptor phosphoryla-
tion, β-arrestin recruitment, or internalization following
exposure to ligand (87). Similar findings have been reported
in cell-population and single-cell studies (196). Even in
studies where desensitization of RXFP1 to overexpression
of β-arrestin-2 has been demonstrated, the effects are rela-
tively small and associated with a small degree of internal-
ization (281). Recent studies from our own lab directly
examining the interaction of RXFP1 and β-arrestin-1 or
β-arrestin-2 using BRET provided no support for interac-
tion between these proteins (Kocan, unpublished observa-
tions). On balance, it seems unlikely that internalization
and desensitization can account for the phenomenon. An-
other possibility reflects the multiple G proteins known to
interact with RXFP1 and RXFP2. Both receptors interact
with Ga<sub>s</sub> and Ga<sub>OB</sub>, and in addition, RXFP1 also recruits
Ga<sub>i3</sub>. If the efficiency of coupling of Ga<sub>s</sub> and Ga<sub>i3</sub> were
high, then the usual concentration-response curve would be
generated with low concentrations of ligand. If this is fol-
lowed however, by lower efficiency coupling to Ga<sub>OB</sub>
which inhibits AC, then inhibition of cAMP production
could occur with higher concentrations of peptide. This,
however, cannot explain the lack of a bell-shaped curve for
RXFP2 stimulation at 3 min, and in addition, this type of
behavior would be unlikely for signaling pathways that do
not involve activation of AC. Finally, the effect could be due
to interaction between the numerous signaling pathways
activated by relaxin family peptides. For instance, another
G protein-coupled receptor, the β<sub>3</sub>-AR, shows clear evi-
dence of interaction between cAMP and MAPK signaling.
The β<sub>3</sub>-AR, like RXFP1 and RXFP2, activates multiple sig-
naling pathways, and one striking finding is that an antag-
onist of cAMP signaling is a strong activator of p38MAPK
signaling (449). However, while the cAMP response to ago-
nists is increased with increased receptor expression, the
p38MAPK response is almost completely abolished. This
suggested that increased cAMP generation associated with
increased receptor expression might be inhibiting p38
MAPK activity, and this was supported by inhibition of the
MAPK response by a cell-permeable cAMP analog (449).
As indicated earlier (see sect. VIA), both RXFP1 and
RXFP2 couple to Ga<sub>s</sub> to increase cAMP and to Ga<sub>OB</sub> to
negatively modulate this effect (198). Only RXFP1 couples
to Ga<sub>i3</sub> to cause a further surge of cAMP by releasing Gβγ

BATHGATE ET AL.
subunits that activate PI3K to promote PKC-ζ transloca-
tion to the plasma membrane where it stimulates AC5
(198, 204, 382, 383). The translocation step is believed
to be responsible for the delay in the Ga<sub>i3</sub>-mediated surge
in cAMP accumulation. However, the G protein activa-
tion and release of Gβγ occurs rapidly after receptor
activation (198), and in addition to effects on PI3K, Gβγ
subunits can also directly influence AC activity (200).
Thus the different pattern of appearance of Gβγ subunits
following activation of RXFP1 and RXFP2 could influ-
ence the concentration-response relationships observed
at early stages following receptor activation.

5. Ligand-directed signaling bias: a common
phenomenon in relaxin family peptide receptors or
an idiosyncrasy of RXFP3?

Ligand-directed signaling bias describes the selective stabi-
lization of particular receptor conformations by ligands re-
sulting in selective activation of downstream signal trans-
duction pathways (22, 151, 277, 278). Although human
relaxin-3 or human relaxin-3 B-chains were originally
thought to be the only ligands that interacted with RXFP3,
there is now evidence that several relaxin peptides interact
with RXFP3 to activate distinct signaling profiles through
different, although sometimes overlapping pathways (545).
Recently, these studies have been extended to examine the
specific signaling pathways activated by human relaxin-2
and human relaxin-3 and also to examine whether the
RXFP3 antagonist R3(BA23–27)R/I5 displayed signaling
bias. Human relaxin-2 was found to activate p38MAPK
and ERK1/2 with lower efficacy than human relaxin-3, but
both peptides have similar efficacy for JNK1/2/3 phosphor-
ylation and the responses are PTX sensitive. In contrast,
R3(BA23–27)R/I5 activated ERK1/2 in a PTX-sensitive
manner, p38MAPK in a PTX-insensitive manner, and did
not activate JNK. Antagonism by R3(BA23–27)R/I5 was
only seen for responses mediated by human relaxin-3 (Ko-
can et al., unpublished data).

More recently, we have examined a wide range of ligands
known to interact with RXFP1. These varied in potency
and efficacy across signaling pathways including cAMP ac-
cumulation, ERK1/2, and p38MAPK phosphorylation, but
there was no indication of ligand-directed signaling bias
with agonists, antagonists, and related peptides such as
INSL3 and INSL5 (Siwek, Kocan, and Summers, unpub-
lished data). It is possible that the lack of signaling bias
observed with the ligands so far tested relates to the mode of
action of RXFP1 where the interaction of the peptide ligand
with the LRR region and the ECL region causes the LDLα
“tethered” ligand to interact with the receptor. Since the
final common pathway is the same for all ligands, this may
explain the inability of the receptor to adopt alternative
signaling conformations. This may become possible if li-
gands that can be developed that target the site on the
receptor utilized by the LDLα module. Alternatively, li-

462 Physiol Rev · VOL 93 · JANUARY 2013 · www.prv.org

gands with an allosteric mode of action may be able to
promote signaling bias. Likewise, no studies to date have
reported signaling bias at RXFP2 and RXFP4. However, it
should be borne in mind that studies to date with relaxin
family peptide receptors have largely been carried out with
a comparatively restricted range of peptides. Only recently
has evidence emerged for short linear peptides that can
activate RXFP1 and RXFP2 (see sect. IXD) (466, 467).

B. Receptor Roles and Potential

1. RXFP2 but not INSL3 in brain

One apparent anomaly that has been described for RXFP2
is the presence of the receptor but not its cognate ligand in
brain. The evidence for the presence of the receptor includes
RT-PCR, in situ hybridization histochemistry, and direct
binding studies with ¹²⁵I-INSL3 (239, 460, 469). In con-
trast, there is no convincing evidence for the expression of
INSL3 in the brain of mammals with the exception of bo-
vine hypothalamus, perhaps reflecting the lack of a relaxin
system in ruminants. Explanations that have been put for-
ward include that brain RXFP2 remains as part of a now
defunct ligand-receptor pairing (561) or that it is the target
for circulating INSL3 that either is transported across or
acts on receptors outside the blood-brain barrier. Sugges-
tions that relaxin might act as a ligand for RXFP2 in brain
appear unlikely due to lack of colocalization.

2. RXFP3: does it have a role in feeding/weight
control or is it one of many systems controlling
these functions?

The relaxin-3-RXFP3 ligand-receptor pairing is predomi-
nantly a neuropeptide receptor system. The cell bodies are
found mainly in the NI and project to many areas of the
brain. There has been a great deal of interest in this system
because of its reported roles in stress and feeding. Most
neurons that express relaxin-3 in the NI also express CRF-
R1, the receptor that responds to CRF released by stress.
Administration of CRF increases c-fos expression in many
relaxin-3 expressing neurons, and swim stress increases re-
laxin-3 mRNA in the NI (86). Although these interactions
are of interest, more work needs to be done to establish the
relationship between stress and the relaxin-3 system.

The interest in the role of relaxin-3-RXFP3 in feeding was
stimulated by the presence of RXFP3 in the hypothalamic
paraventricular nuclei. ICV injection of relaxin-3 or the
RXFP3 agonist R3/I5 into the brain of rats increased feed-
ing, and the effects are blocked by the antagonist R3(BΔ23–
27)/I5 (486). Human relaxin-2 given in the same manner
decreased food intake, perhaps reflecting its actions on
RXFP1 or alternatively its different spectrum of action at
RXFP3 (545). Exploitation of the contrasting effects of bi-
ased agonists at RXFP3 would establish a novel paradigm

for drug action. However, the actions of relaxin-3 on feed-
ing do not appear to involve changes in expression of other
hypothalamic peptides known to have roles in appetite con-
trol including neuropeptide Y, proopiomelanocortin, or ag-
outi-related peptide (486). It has been suggested that the
actions of relaxin-3 on feeding do not represent a primary
role for this neuropeptide system but rather reflect its wider
role as an arousal neuromodulator (486).

3. What is the role of RXFP4?

Studies of the physiological role of RXFP4 are at a much
earlier stage than those of RXFP3. Although human relax-
in-3 was found to activate RXFP4 (GPR142) (313), it was
quickly recognized that this peptide was unlikely to be the
cognate ligand (98) based largely on the tissue expression
profile. Whereas relaxin-3 is largely confined to the brain,
RXFP4 has a wide tissue distribution including colon, kid-
ney, placenta, prostate, thymus, thyroid, and salivary gland
with only small amounts found in brain (313). Subsequent
work provided strong evidence that a related peptide INSL5
was likely the cognate ligand for RXFP4, since it showed a
similar tissue distribution and selectively activated the re-
ceptor (315). Although RXFP4 in the rat is a pseudogene
and in mice shows some sequence variation, in other species
such as human, monkey, cow, and pig, it is highly conserved
and displays similar ligand specificity (98). At the present
time, the physiological role of INSL5-RXFP4 is unclear,
although a recent report suggests that polymorphisms of
RXFP4 may be associated with obesity (376). This is of
particular interest given the potential role of relaxin-3-
RXFP3 in appetite control (see NOTE ADDED IN PROOF 1).

C. Therapeutic Actions of Relaxin

1. What is the mechanism of action of relaxin in the
treatment of cardiac failure?

Cardiac failure is a complicated disease that reflects the
interplay between many different mechanisms. It involves
weakness of the cardiac muscle that can be brought about
by genetic abnormalities, loss of cardiac muscle following
infarction, or secondary to pressure overload due to hyper-
tension. These stressful stimuli cause remodeling of the
heart which is initially compensatory but eventually leads to
ventricular dilatation, reduced cardiac output, and arrhyth-
mias. One of the features of cardiac failure is the presence of
high circulating levels of neurohumoral agents such as cat-
echolamines, angiotensin, endothelin, cytokines, insulin-
like growth factors, and natriuretic peptides (465). Overac-
tivity of the sympathetic nervous system and the renin-an-
giotensin-aldosterone system are particularly important,
and antagonists acting on these systems have proven valu-
able treatments that substantially reduce morbidity and
mortality (296). However, heart failure is characteristically
a chronic disease that is progressive so that even with recent

improvements in treatment novel approaches are required
to produce better outcomes.

Overactivity of the sympathetic nervous system is initially a
compensatory response that improves cardiac output by
increasing the force and rate of the heartbeat. Chronic ac-
tivation, however, leads to desensitization of β-adrenocep-
tors, cardiac hypertrophy, and apoptosis of cardiac myo-
cytes with fibrosis and cardiac arrhythmias. High levels of
angiotensin II and endothelin are associated with cardiac
hypertrophy, fibrosis, and cardiac arrhythmias. Blockade of
β-adrenoceptors, ACE inhibitors, or AT₁ receptor blockade
are highly effective means of treating cardiac failure (296),
whereas the effects of endothelin antagonists are more
equivocal (207). Relaxin is now in phase III clinical trial for
the treatment of cardiac failure, yet the mechanism of action
is not well understood. Although there are a number of
possible mechanisms suggested by mainly animal studies,
clear links between these effects and the response to relaxin
in cardiac failure have yet to be made. The vasodilator
actions of relaxin mediated through NO (31, 33, 154, 343,
346) could have antihypertrophic effects (465), reduce pe-
ripheral resistance and hence cardiac work load, and also
help maintain viability of cardiac muscle. Relaxin is also
angiogenic, since cAMP increases in response to activation
of RXFP1 lead to increased expression of VEGF (541).
Relaxin has long been recognized as a powerful inotropic
and chronotropic agent (271) and has recently been shown
to have similar effects in humans (127). However, in all
species so far studied, these cardiac responses have been
confined to the atria and would be expected to have little
influence on ventricular ejection fraction. Relaxin also has
anti-inflammatory effects (345) and would be expected to
reduce tissue damage in cardiac failure. At present, it is not
clear which if any of these effects is involved in the positive
response to relaxin in cardiac failure. In addition, aspects of
relaxin-RXFP1 signaling have been extensively studied in in-
vitro systems, but the situation could be quite different in path-
ological situations such as heart failure, particularly when fur-
ther complicated by additional drug administration. G pro-
tein-coupled receptor activation by catecholamines, angioten-
sin II, and endothelins leads to coupling to a variety of G
proteins including Gαₛ, Gαₚ, Gα₁₁ and Gβγ that in turn can
activate AC, phospholipase C, Akt, ERK1/2, p38MAPK, and
PKA to have hypertrophic effects (465). A compensatory re-
sponse that increases natriuretic peptides and leads to NO
stimulation of guanylyl cyclase causes an antihypertrophic
effect (465). Since relaxin is known to release NO and va-
sodilation in systemic arteries is endothelium dependent
(170), this may underlie some of the beneficial effects of
relaxin. However, this study also showed that the effects of
relaxin were influenced by treatment of patients with ACE
inhibitors and responses of blood vessels to relaxin could be
altered by treatment with indomethacin or blockade of NO
synthase. In the phase I trial of relaxin, all of the patients
were treated with an ACE inhibitor or AT₁ receptor antag-

BATHGATE ET AL.
onist, as well as a diuretic and a β-adrenoceptor antagonist
(134). In the phase II clinical trial, 62–69% of patients were
treated with ACE inhibitors, 51–59% with β-adrenoceptor
antagonists, 24–38% with aldosterone antagonists, and
14–30% with digoxin (526). Clearly, there are many op-
portunities for interactions between relaxin and a variety of
pathways, and examination of potential interactions in in-
vitro systems may help clarify the mechanism of action of
relaxin in vivo.

2. Is there a future for relaxin in the treatment
of fibrosis?

Although the early clinical trials of relaxin for the treatment
of sclerosis appeared encouraging (92) and a subsequent
placebo-controlled trial indicated that low-dose relaxin
produced significant improvement in skin and lung param-
eters (462), the phase II/III trial that followed was unsuc-
cessful (149, 461). It is possible that the failure of this trial
reflects the severity of the scleroderma in the patients chosen
for the trial (54). Nonetheless, the large number of animal
studies in which relaxin was successfully shown to have
antifibrotic properties still provide a strong case for its po-
tential utility in the treatment of pulmonary, renal, cardiac,
and hepatic fibrosis. Certainly work continues in this area
to attempt to demonstrate antifibrotic effects that will be
useful in humans (420, 437, 518).

D. Agonist and Antagonist Development for
RXFP Receptors

There is now a basic understanding of the mode of endog-
enous peptide ligand binding at RXFP1–3 with limited
knowledge of the mode of interaction of INSL5 with
RXFP4 (sect. III). There are currently peptide-based antag-
onists for all of the receptors with the most efficacious com-
pounds targeting RXFP3 (213, 299, 463). These com-
pounds have already been used to assist in determining the
role of relaxin-3 in the brain. Relaxin-3 peptide analogs
have also been developed that are specific agonists for
RXFP3 over RXFP1 (312, 463). However, these peptide-
based analogs are unlikely to cross the blood-brain barrier
so must be injected directly into the brain to be effective.
Currently there are no small molecule RXFP3 agonists or
antagonists reported, although a recent study has described
an RXFP3-specific relaxin-3-positive allosteric modulator
that was effective when used with relaxin-3 COOH-termi-
nal amide peptides but was unfortunately not effective with
the native relaxin COOH-terminal acid peptide (7).

The complex mechanism whereby relaxin binds to RXFP1 has
meant that there are currently no high-affinity peptide antag-
onists, and since the relaxin peptide itself rapidly loses activity
when truncated, it is likely that a small peptide agonist acting
at the orthosteric sites utilized by relaxin will be difficult to
develop (232, 233). However, what is clear is that the peptide

RELAXIN FAMILY PEPTIDES AND THEIR RECEPTORS

can be modified at the NH₂ terminus of both the A- and B-chains, meaning that potentially it can be modified to improve its pharmacokinetic properties and make it more drug-like (232, 233). Small peptide antagonists have been developed that target RXFP2 that exploit the different binding mechanism of INSL3 to RXFP2 compared with relaxin binding to RXFP1 (121, 464). However, the complex activation mechanism associated with leucine-rich repeat containing GPCRs has precluded the development of small peptide agonists. The isolated LDLa module has been demonstrated to act as a RXFP1 antagonist (456, 457), and it is possible that if the mechanism of action of the LDLa module in activating RXFP1 and RXFP2 is determined, then specific agonists or antagonists could be designed. Currently, no small molecule RXFP1 or RXFP2 agonists or antagonists have been reported (see NOTE ADDED IN PROOF 2). A possible approach that has currently only been adopted for RXFP3 is the use of allosteric modulators that typically target binding sites distinct from the orthosteric sites utilized by the endogenous ligands.

An interesting recent development has been the discovery of short linear peptides derived from an unidentified natural precursor protein that were able to activate RXFP1 and RXFP2, but not RXFP3 receptors expressed in CHO cells (466, 467). Further in vitro studies demonstrated that one of these peptides (CGEN-25009) is able to activate fibroblasts and THP1 cells expressing RXFP1. The peptide was able to reduce lung inflammation and injury as well as ameliorate adverse airway remodeling and peribronchial fibrosis in a mouse model of pulmonary fibrosis in a manner similar to relaxin (420). CGEN-25009 and other peptides (CGEN-25010 and -25011) produced complex concentration-response relationships in cell systems expressing RXFP1 or RXFP2 with either inhibition or stimulation of cAMP accumulation being observed (466). Some of the differences are attributable to assay conditions such as the use of forskolin to amplify responses but also could be explained by measurement of cAMP directly or by the use of CRE reporter gene assays that display responses not only to cAMP but also other signaling pathways and in particular MAPKs. It has also yet to be definitely demonstrated that these peptides mediate their actions at RXFP1 or RXFP2 and even if they do the mechanism of binding is likely to be very different from that of the endogenous ligands. However, it is clear that some promising tools for the study of relaxin family peptides are starting to emerge that will begin to answer some of the questions raised in this section.
