primary messenger generated in response to ACTH receptor activation, cAMP acts at multiple sites to produce the full steroidogenic response that includes both rapid and delayed components. Biochemically, cAMP activates and induces the expression of multiple proteins that function in converting cholesterol to cortisol. These include the steroid acute regulatory (StAR) protein as well as steroidogenic enzymes. cAMP also inhibits a background K⁺ channel (bTREK-1), which sets the resting potential of adrenal zona fasciculata (AZF) cells, thereby triggering membrane depolarization and Ca²⁺ entry through voltage-gated Ca²⁺ channels. Ca²⁺ also accelerates the production of cortisol from cholesterol by activating or inducing the synthesis of steroidogenic proteins. In this scheme, background K⁺ channels act pivotally by transducing a hormonal signal at the cell membrane to an ionic signal, leading to depolarization-dependent Ca²⁺ entry. In this way, ACTH receptor activation increases cAMP and Ca²⁺ in the AZF cell, yielding the full steroidogenic response.

In addition to acutely regulating the activity of AZF cell ion channels, ACTH and cAMP also regulate the expression of genes coding for these ion channels. The tonic control of the expression of AZF cell ion channels through the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis suggests that prolonged stimulation of the AZF cell by ACTH may alter the electrical properties of these cells in a manner which matches the organism’s requirement for cortisol. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

### I. INTRODUCTION

Cortisol secretion by adrenal zona fasciculata (AZF) cells occurs in a diurnal rhythm chiefly under the control of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), a 39-amino acid peptide released from pituitary corticotrophs. Superimposed on this basal secretory pattern, physical and psychologically stressful stimuli trigger bursts of ACTH-stimulated cortisol production (Norman and Litwack, 1997). At the AZF cell, ACTH activates a G-protein-coupled receptor of the melanocortin family, inducing both rapid and delayed increases in cortisol synthesis (Mountjoy *et al.*, 1992; Simpson and Waterman, 1988; Stocco and Clark, 1996).

The rapid phase of ACTH-stimulated corticosteroid synthesis occurs within minutes and involves the accelerated delivery of cortisol to the cytochrome P450 side chain cleavage enzyme located in the inner mitochondrial membrane. This rate-limiting step in steroid hormone formation is facilitated by the steroidogenic acute regulatory (StAR) protein, whose synthesis is rapidly enhanced by ACTH and other steroidogenic factors. The function of StAR in the acute regulation of steroid synthesis has been reviewed (Jefcoate, 2004; Stocco, 1999, 2001; Stocco and Clark, 1996). The delayed actions of ACTH on AZF cells occur over a period of many hours and involve the induction of mRNAs coding for each of the steroidogenic
enzymes that convert cholesterol to cortisol (Miller, 1988; Simpson and Waterman, 1988; Simpson *et al.*, 1992; Waterman, 1994).

Although the central role for the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis and ACTH in short- and long-term regulation of steroidogenesis is well established, the biochemical and ionic events that couple ACTH receptor activation to cortisol production are not completely understood. In this regard, ACTH receptors are among the first that were demonstrated to be coupled to adenylate cyclase activation and the synthesis of cAMP (Beall and Sayers, 1972; Hanes *et al.*, 1959; Haynes, 1958). cAMP is widely regarded as the primary intracellular messenger mediating steroidogenic responses to ACTH in AZF cells. cAMP induces the expression of StAR as well as the steroidogenic enzymes in the pathway from cholesterol to cortisol (Nishikawa *et al.*, 1996; Pulak *et al.*, 2002; Simpson and Waterman, 1988; Stocco, 2001).

Ca²⁺ also functions critically in regulating corticosteroid production. Ca²⁺ rapidly induces the expression of StAR protein in adrenocortical cells, stimulating intramitochondrial cholesterol transfer (Cherradi *et al.*, 1996, 1998; Clark *et al.*, 1995; Python *et al.*, 1995; Stocco, 2001). Ca²⁺ also induces the expression of steroidogenic enzymes in the pathway to cortisol synthesis (Bird *et al.*, 1995, 1998). The Ca²⁺ ionophore A23187 produces a dose-dependent increase in cortisol synthesis by a human adrenal cell line (Laird *et al.*, 1991).

In addition to increasing cAMP in adrenocortical cells, ACTH also increases intracellular free Ca²⁺ ([Ca²⁺]i) through a mechanism that depends on extracellular Ca²⁺ and requires Ca²⁺ entry through voltage-gated Ca²⁺ channels. ACTH-stimulated Ca²⁺ influx through voltage-gated Ca²⁺ channels and ACTH-stimulated cortisol secretion are inhibited by antagonists of voltage-gated Ca²⁺ channels (Enyeart *et al.*, 1993; Kimoto *et al.*, 2004; Kojima *et al.*, 1985; Yamazaki *et al.*, 1998; Yanagibashi *et al.*, 1990).

Overall, these results are consistent with a model in which cAMP and Ca²⁺ function as dual messengers for ACTH, both of which are required for the full steroidogenic response in AZF cells. In this regard, the identification of a specific background K⁺ channel that sets the resting membrane potential of AZF cells and couples ACTH receptor activation to depolarization-dependent Ca²⁺ entry through a cAMP intermediate has lead to an integrated model of the biochemical and ionic events that underlie ACTH-stimulated cortisol production (Enyeart *et al.*, 2002; Mlinar *et al.*, 1993a).


II. ACTH RECEPTORS: CAMP- AND CA²⁺-DEPENDENT SIGNALING

Early studies with ¹²⁵I-labelled ACTH showed that this peptide bound to a single population of receptors on rat and human AZF cells, with K<sub>d</sub> ranging from 1.4 to 1.6 nM (Buckley and Ramachandran, 1981; Catalano

et al., 1986). Molecular cloning of human and bovine ACTH receptors showed that they belong to the melanocortin family of G-protein-coupled receptors that are coupled to adenylate cyclase activation through Gs (Mountjoy et al., 1992; Raikhinstein et al., 1994).

The central role for cAMP as the primary mediator of ACTH-stimulated responses, including cortisol secretion, has been questioned in consideration of some apparently contradictory results. Specifically, ACTH-stimulated effects on adrenal cells required the presence of extracellular Ca²⁺ (Kojima and Ogata, 1986; Matthews and Saffran, 1973). Further, ACTH triggered increases in [Ca²⁺]i, stimulated cortisol secretion, and activated immediate early genes at concentrations approximately 100-fold lower than those required to produce significant increases in cAMP production by adrenocortical cells (Enyeart and Enyeart, 1998; Enyeart et al., 1996a; Kojima and Ogata, 1986; Moyle et al., 1973). An ACTH derivative, nitrophenylsulfenyl-adrenocorticotropic hormone (NPS-ACTH) increased [Ca²⁺]i and steroidogenesis in rat and bovine adrenocortical cells at concentrations that produced no measurable increases in cAMP (Moyle et al., 1973; Yamazaki et al., 1998).

These results led some to conclude that the effects of ACTH, particularly at low concentrations, were mediated by Ca²⁺ influx through a cAMP-independent mechanism, possibly involving a second high affinity ACTH receptor (Moyle et al., 1973; Yamazaki et al., 1998). Several lines of evidence, however, suggest that all of the effects of ACTH, including those mediated by an increase in [Ca²⁺]i, are initiated through a cAMP intermediate. More specifically, ACTH-induced increases in [Ca²⁺]i occur secondary to cAMP-induced changes in specific ionic conductances, leading to membrane depolarization.

Because ACTH triggered effects on AZF cells at concentrations where only small increases in cAMP could be measured, it was concluded that these actions were mediated through a cAMP-independent process. Most cAMP-dependent actions in eukaryotic cells occur, however, through A-kinase-dependent phosphorylation of cellular proteins. Therefore, ACTH-mediated responses in these cells would be expected to parallel the relative activation of A-kinase rather than the amount of cAMP produced. Accordingly, ACTH activated A-kinase in AZF cells with an EC₅₀ of 2.5 pM, a concentration similar to the one that activated other cellular responses including cortisol secretion and immediate-early gene expression (Enyeart and Enyeart, 1998; Enyeart et al., 1996a; Moyle et al., 1973). Apparently, ACTH must activate only a small fraction (~3%) of specific receptors to induce the synthesis of enough cAMP for maximum activation of A-kinase.

These results indicate that cAMP is indeed the primary intracellular messenger mediating ACTH actions in AZF cells. The maximal activation of A-kinase by small quantities of cAMP underlies the extraordinary potency of ACTH in producing many of its effects in these cells. Indeed, even the
Ca²⁺-dependent actions of ACTH appear to occur through cAMP-induced modulation of specific ionic conductances and membrane potential as described in the following section. Thus, cAMP and Ca²⁺ function as dual intracellular messengers that together control ACTH-stimulated cortisol secretion.

# III. IONIC MECHANISMS IN ACTH-STIMULATED CORTISOL SECRETION

In many secretory cells, the release of transmitters and hormones is coupled to Na⁺-dependent action potentials through activation of voltage-gated Ca²⁺ channels. However, AZF cells lack voltage-gated Na⁺ channels, the hallmark of excitable cells (Mlinar et al., 1993). Nevertheless, a great deal of evidence indicates that ACTH-stimulated cortisol secretion is mediated in part by depolarization-dependent Ca²⁺ entry through voltage-gated Ca²⁺ channels. ACTH receptor activation is coupled to membrane depolarization through cAMP-dependent inhibition of specific background K⁺ channels that set the membrane potential (Vₘ) (Mlinar et al., 1993).

## A. ELECTRICAL PROPERTIES OF AZF CELLS

Intracellular recordings of membrane potential (Vₘ) from AZF cells of several species indicate that these cells maintain negative resting potentials determined primarily by the K⁺ gradient across the cell membrane, as predicted by the Nernst equation (Lymangrover et al., 1982; Matthews, 1967; Matthews and Saffran, 1973; Mlinar et al., 1993; Quinn et al., 1987). Exposure of these cells to ACTH caused membrane depolarization and, in some instances, multiple regenerative Ca²⁺-dependent action potentials (Lymangrover et al., 1982; Matthews and Saffran, 1973). Depolarizing current pulses also produced regenerative Ca²⁺-dependent responses from dissociated rat AZF cells (Barbara and Takeda, 1995; Quinn et al., 1987). Thus, although AZF cells lack voltage-gated Na⁺ channels, they display properties of excitability that could support substantial depolarization-dependent Ca²⁺ entry in response to stimulation by ACTH.

## B. VOLTAGE-GATED Ca²⁺ CHANNELS

AZF cells have been reported to express both low-voltage activated, rapidly inactivating T-type Ca²⁺ channels and high-voltage activated, slowly inactivating L-type channels (Barbara and Takeda, 1995; Guyot et al., 2000; Mlinar et al., 1993b). However, only T-type Ca²⁺ channels are prominently expressed in the majority of freshly dissociated rat and bovine AZF cells while L-type currents increase over a period of days in culture (Barbara and
Takeda, 1995; Mlinar *et al.*, 1993). It is unknown whether the increase in L-type Ca²⁺ channel density with time in culture is an artifact induced by culture conditions.

In whole-cell patch-clamp experiments, ACTH and cAMP did not directly modulate the activity of T-type Ca²⁺ currents in bovine or rat AZF cells (Barbara and Takeda, 1995; Mlinar *et al.*, 1993b). Organic Ca²⁺ antagonists, including those that preferentially block T-type Ca²⁺ currents, however, inhibit ACTH-stimulated cortisol secretion and Ca²⁺ currents at similar concentrations (Enyeart *et al.*, 1993; Li *et al.*, 1989; Yamazaki *et al.*, 1998; Yanagibashi *et al.*, 1990). Thus, although ACTH does not directly modulate voltage-gated Ca²⁺ channels in AZF cells, Ca²⁺ entry through these channels is required for ACTH-stimulated cortisol secretion. The identity of the Ca²⁺ channels that mediate ACTH-stimulated secretion is complicated by the lack of selectivity of organic Ca²⁺ antagonists, particularly the dihydropyridines which block T as well as L-type Ca²⁺ channels (Akaike *et al.*, 1989; Enyeart *et al.*, 1993).

### C. K⁺ CHANNELS

AZF cells express at least two distinct K⁺ channel subtypes. In whole cell patch clamp recordings, these subtypes appear as a voltage-gated, rapidly inactivating ‘A’-type K⁺ current and a noninactivating leak-type K⁺ current (Barbara and Takeda, 1995; Bilbaut *et al.*, 1996; Mlinar and Enyeart, 1993; Mlinar *et al.*, 1993a). The rapidly inactivating K⁺ current in bovine AZF cells is robustly expressed in nearly every cell and was identified by molecular cloning as Kv1.4 (Enyeart *et al.*, 2000). In excitable cells, such as neurons, voltage-gated rapidly inactivating A-type K⁺ currents function to space action potentials (Connor and Stevens, 1971; Neher, 1971).

Bovine AZF cells also express a noninactivating background K⁺ channel that sets the resting potential while it is potently inhibited by ACTH (IC₅₀ = 5.4 pM) at concentrations identical to those that trigger membrane depolarization and cortisol secretion (Enyeart *et al.*, 1996b; Mlinar *et al.*, 1993a). This background K⁺ channel was also inhibited in whole cell patch clamp recordings by a membrane-permeable analogue of cAMP. Inhibition of this K⁺ channel by ACTH and cAMP was insensitive to several A-kinase inhibitors but required hydrolyzable forms of ATP, suggesting involvement of a second kinase or ATP hydrolysis-dependent pathway (Enyeart *et al.*, 1996b).

The background K⁺ channel was identified by molecular cloning as bTREK-1 (or KCNK2), a member of the two-pore, four-transmembrane segment (2P/4TMS) family of background K⁺ channels (Enyeart *et al.*, 2002; Fink *et al.*, 1996; Goldstein *et al.*, 2001; Patel *et al.*, 1998). TREK-1 K⁺ channels cloned thus far are inhibited by an A-kinase–dependent phosphorylation at serine-333 (Maingret *et al.*, 2000). Overall, these results indicate

that ACTH- and cAMP-mediated inhibition of bTREK-1 both occur through separate A-kinase-dependent and A-kinase-independent signaling pathways.

In addition to activating A-kinase, cAMP directly activates a guanine nucleotide exchange factor cAMP-GEFII (or EPAC2) that is prominently expressed in rat and human adrenal glands (de Rooij et al., 1998; Kawasaki et al., 1998). When activated, cAMP-GEFII in turn activates a ras family GTP binding protein RAP1A, which itself activates signaling pathways, including MAP kinase. It is unknown whether A-kinase-independent inhibition of bTREK-1 is mediated through a GEFII (EPAC2)-dependent mechanism. If so, then ACTH-dependent inhibition of bTREK-1 occurs through parallel pathways (Fig. 1).

Other hormones and paracrine factors that stimulate cortisol synthesis through activation of G-protein-coupled receptors also inhibit bTREK-1 K⁺ channels. These include Angiotensin II (AII), which activates a losartan-sensitive AT₁ receptor, and ATP and UTP, which activate P2Y₃ nucleotide receptors on bovine AZF cells (Mlinar et al., 1993a, 1995; Xu and Enyeart, 1999).

bTREK-1 channels are also modulated by ionic and metabolic factors. They are directly activated by intracellular ATP and other nucleotides and by acidification of the cytoplasm (Enyeart et al., 1997, 2000). In addition, native bTREK-1 channels are inhibited by intracellular Ca²⁺ through a mechanism that is independent of protein kinases (Gomora and Enyeart, 1998).

Overall, these distinctive properties of bTREK-1 channels suggest that they represent a central control point where hormonal and metabolic signals are integrated and transduced to depolarization-dependent Ca²⁺ entry and

cortisol secretion. Within this scheme, cAMP synthesized in response to ACTH receptor activation stimulates cortisol synthesis by activation of cAMP and Ca²⁺-dependent signaling pathways. Along one pathway, cAMP activates A-kinase, which in turn activates and induces the proteins and steroidogenic enzymes that convert cholesterol to cortisol (Bird *et al.*, 1998; Simpson and Waterman, 1988; Waterman, 1994). In addition, cAMP-mediated inhibition of bTREK-1 by mechanisms dependent on or independent of A-kinase is coupled to depolarization-dependent Ca²⁺ entry through T-type and possibly L-type Ca²⁺ channels. Ca²⁺ entering through voltage-gated Ca²⁺ channels functions in concert with cAMP to markedly enhance cortisol production (Fig. 2).

Although this model identifies a mechanism whereby a hormonal signal at the cell membrane (ACTH) could be coupled to cAMP and Ca²⁺-dependent stimulation of cortisol synthesis, it suffers from several shortcomings. First, even though the inhibition of bTREK-1 by ACTH identifies a specific mechanism for membrane depolarization and activation of T-type Ca²⁺ channels, it does not provide for an efficient means of increasing [Ca²⁺]i in AZF cells. Specifically, because T-type Ca²⁺ channels inactivate with a time constant of less than 20 ms at –20 mV, a sustained depolarization would enhance Ca²⁺ entry only for a period of less than 100 ms (Mlinar *et al.*, 1993a). Second, this model fails to assign any function to the voltage-gated, rapidly inactivating Kv1.4 K⁺ current that is robustly expressed in nearly every cell.

These results and considerations, along with the measured voltage-dependent gating and kinetic parameters of each ion channel expressed by AZF cells, are consistent with a model for depolarization-dependent Ca²⁺

entry that depends on the generation of Ca²⁺-dependent action potentials (Barbara and Takeda, 1995; Mlinar and Enyeart, 1993; Mlinar *et al.*, 1993b). This model assigns a specific function to each of the three ion channels expressed by AZF cells and allows for sustained Ca²⁺ entry through T-type Ca²⁺ channels. Specifically, open bTREK-1 channels maintain AZF cells at negative resting potentials and act as a “brake” on the electrical activity. Inhibition of bTREK-1 by ACTH leads to membrane depolarization and the activation of opposing T-type Ca²⁺ currents and A-type K⁺ currents, resulting in the generation of repetitive action potentials and associated Ca²⁺ entry.

This model predicts that agents selectively activating bTREK-1 K⁺ channels would oppose ACTH-induced membrane depolarization and cortisol secretion. Accordingly, a novel caffeic acid ester that activates up to thousands of dormant bTREK-1 K⁺ channels in AZF cells overwhelmed the inhibition of bTREK-1 by ACTH, reversed membrane depolarization, and inhibited ACTH-stimulated cortisol secretion (Danthi *et al.*, 2004).

## D. OTHER ION CHANNELS EXPRESSED BY AZF CELLS

In addition to the three ion channels already described, adrenocortical cells also express at least two other types of ion channels that may function in ACTH-stimulated cortisol production. Bovine AZF cells express nonselective TRPC4 cation channels that are Ca²⁺-permeable, and these may be involved in Ca²⁺-activated steroidogenesis (Ebisawa *et al.*, 2000; Phillip *et al.*, 2000). Capacitative Ca²⁺ influx through TRP-type channels appears to be important in AII-stimulated steroidogenesis by bovine adrenal glomerulosa cells (Burnay *et al.*, 1994). Whether cAMP modulates TRP activity is presently unknown.

Bovine AZF cells also express an ACTH- and cAMP-activated chloride channel that may participate in the regulation of membrane potential and ionic events involved in cortisol secretion (Dupre-Aucouturier *et al.*, 2002).

## IV. CHRONIC CONTROL OF ION CHANNEL EXPRESSION BY ACTH IN AZF CELLS

In addition to acutely controlling the activity of pre-existing ion channels in AZF cells, ACTH also regulates the expression of both K⁺ and Ca²⁺ channels in these cells. Specifically, ACTH rapidly reduces the expression of Kv1.4 mRNA in bovine AZF cells with a t1/2 of approximately 1 h and an IC₅₀ near 1 pM. This effect is mimicked by the membrane-permeable cAMP analogue 8-pcpt-cAMP. The reduction in Kv1.4 mRNA is followed for a period of 72 hr by a pronounced decrease in the associated K⁺ current (Enyeart *et al.*, 2000). Whether these ACTH and cAMP-induced actions
occur through an effect on Kv1.4 gene transcription or mRNA stability is not known.

In contrast to the inhibition of Kv1.4 expression, ACTH and cAMP induce the expression of bTREK-1 mRNA and associated K⁺ current in bovine AZF cells. The induction of bTREK-1 mRNA is blocked by inhibitors of protein synthesis and gene transcription ([Enyeart et al., 2003]).

The expression of voltage-gated T-type, but not L-type, Ca²⁺ channels by rat AZF cells is also enhanced by prolonged (72 hr) exposure of these cells to ACTH. This effect, however, was surprisingly not mimicked by 8-bromo-cAMP or forskolin ([Barbara and Takeda, 1995]). These results indicate that the expression of each of three ion channels expressed by AZF cells is tonically controlled by the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis through ACTH. They further suggest that prolonged stimulation of AZF cells by ACTH, as in chronic stress or disease, may reshape the electrical properties of these cells to enhance or limit cortisol secretion.

In this regard, the signaling pathways by which ACTH functions to regulate the expression of K⁺ and Ca²⁺ channels are poorly understood. The ACTH- and cAMP-mediated reductions in Kv1.4 mRNA are only partially inhibited by A-kinase inhibition with H-89 ([Enyeart et al., 2000]). Similarly, the induction of bTREK-1 mRNA by ACTH and 8-pcpt-cAMP was only partially inhibited by this A-kinase antagonist ([Enyeart et al., 2003]).

The failure of A-kinase antagonists to inhibit the effects of ACTH and 8-pcpt-cAMP on K⁺ channel expression raised the possibility that these actions were mediated by activation of cAMP–GEFII (EPAC2). However, 8-(4-chloro-phenylthio)-2-O-methyladenosine-3′-5′-cyclic monophosphate, a cAMP analogue that activates cAMP–GEFII but not A-kinase, failed to induce bTREK-1 mRNA ([Enserink et al., 2002; Enyeart et al., 2003]).

Overall, the long-term modulation of ion channel expression in AZF cells by ACTH may involve signaling pathways in addition to those currently known to mediate the actions of this peptide hormone. It will be interesting to determine whether cAMP–GEFII mediates any of the responses to ACTH in AZF cells. If activation of GEFII is not involved in cortisol synthesis, perhaps it functions in regulating growth or differentiation of adrenocortical cells.

## V. SUMMARY AND PROSPECTS

ACTH induces rapid and long-term effects on cortisol production through a combination of biochemical and ionic mechanisms that employ cAMP and Ca²⁺ as intracellular messengers. Findings suggest a model for cortisol secretion wherein cAMP, produced in response to ACTH receptor activation, acts through multiple signaling pathways. These include thetraditional A-kinase-dependent pathway that activates and induces steroidogenic enzymes and a second pathway wherein cAMP inhibits bTREK-1 K⁺ channels, leading to depolarization-dependent Ca²⁺ entry through voltage-gated channels.

The identification of bTREK-1 as the K⁺ channel that sets the resting potential of AZF cells while it is inhibited by ACTH through cAMP provides a specific mechanism by which hormonal signals originating at the cell membrane are transduced to conductance changes, leading to cortisol production. The pivotal function of bTREK-1 in this system is reinforced by its ability to integrate a variety of hormonal and metabolic signals and to couple these to changes in membrane potential (Vₘ) and Ca²⁺ entry. In this respect, AZF cells resemble many excitable secretory cells where increases in [Ca²⁺]ᵢ occur as a result of depolarization-dependent Ca²⁺ entry through voltage-gated channels.

Overall, the role of electrical activity and specific ion channels in AZF cell physiology is poorly understood and may have been underestimated. Studies using cultured, enzymatically dissociated cells fail to reproduce the *in vivo* physiology for a number of reasons. First, ion channels in the cell membrane may be altered or inactivated by the enzymatic dissociation processes. Further, AZF cells' ion channel expression changes markedly during a period of several days in culture (Barbara and Takeda, 1995; Enyeart *et al.*, 2000, 2003). In the intact adrenal, AZF cells are coupled by gap junctions that mediate cell-to-cell communication and markedly affect their sensitivity and responsiveness to ACTH (Munari-Silem *et al.*, 1995). Finally, although the activity of many ion channels, including those expressed by AZF cells is temperature-dependent, most single cell recordings are made at room temperature.

For all these reasons, the electrical activity in dissociated AZF cells in culture at room temperature is quite different from that of AZF cells at 37 °C in an intact gland. Intracellular recordings from AZF cells in an adrenal slice at 37 °C may offer the best opportunity for determining whether these cells generate Ca²⁺-dependent action potentials in response to depolarization with ACTH.

Although Ca²⁺ entering through voltage-gated channels functions as an intracellular messenger in ACTH-stimulated cortisol production, Ca²⁺ entry through other Ca²⁺-permeable channels could contribute to the steroidogenic response. These include TRP-type channels and the mitochondrial uniporter identified as a highly selective Ca²⁺ channel (Kirichok *et al.*, 2004; Phillipi *et al.*, 2000). ACTH regulation of the channels' activity in AZF cells has not been determined.

Ca²⁺ entering the AZF cells through voltage-gated channels could enhance cortisol production by several mechanisms. Because cholesterol transport in the mitochondria has emerged as the control point for steroidogenesis, the Ca²⁺-dependent activation or increase of StAR protein synthesis
may be critical to ACTH-induced cortisol synthesis, just as for AII-stimulated aldosterone synthesis (Cherradi *et al.*, 1996, 1998; Li *et al.*, 2003).

In addition to enhancing StAR activity and gene transcription, Ca²⁺ can also induce the expression of steroidogenic enzymes in adrenocortical cells (Bird *et al.*, 1995, 1998). The combined effects of Ca²⁺ on StAR and steroidogenic enzymes may mediate the acute and delayed actions of Ca²⁺ on cortisol synthesis.
