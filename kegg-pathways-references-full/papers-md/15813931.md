## Abstract

The resetting of the circadian clock based on photic cues delivered by the glutamatergic retinohypothalamic tract is an important process helping mammals to function adaptively to the daily light–dark cycle. To see if the photic resetting relies on voltage-gated Ca²⁺ channels (VGCCs), we examined the effects of VGCC blockers on the glutamate-induced phase shifts of circadian firing activity rhythms of suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) neurons in hypothalamic slices. First, we found that a cocktail of amiloride, nimodipine and ω-conotoxin MVIIIC (T-, L- and NPQ-type VGCC antagonists, respectively) completely blocked both phase delays and advances, which were, respectively, induced by glutamate application in early and late night. Next, we discovered that: (i) amiloride and another T-type VGCC antagonist, mibefradil, completely obstructed the delays without affecting the advances; (ii) nimodipine completely blocked the advances while having less impact on delays; and (iii) ω-conotoxin MVIIIC blocked largely, if not entirely, both delays and advances. Subsequent whole-cell recordings revealed that T-type Ca²⁺ currents in neurons in the ventrolateral, not dorsomedial, region of the SCN were larger during early than late night, whereas L-type Ca²⁺ currents did not differ from early to late night in both regions. These results indicate that VGCCs play important roles in glutamate-induced phase shifts, T-type being more important for phase delays and L-type being so for phase advances. Moreover, the results point to the possibility that a nocturnal modulation of T-type Ca²⁺ current in retinorecipient neurons is related to the differential involvement of T-type VGCC in phase delays and advances.

## Introduction

In mammals, the primary pacemaker that orchestrates daily rhythms in physiology and behaviour resides in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN; for review, see Klein *et al.*, 1991). This pacemaker, whose intrinsic period is about 24 h and therefore called the circadian clock, is normally synchronized with (or entrained to) the exact 24-h cycle of the physical world. The synchronization that helps organisms to adapt to their cyclic external environment is acquired when the circadian clock resets itself on the basis of various time cues arising from outside the body. The dominant time cue is known to be the photic cue, which is delivered by the retinohypothalamic tract (RHT), a direct projection from the retina to the ventrolateral region of the SCN (Hendrickson *et al.*, 1972; Moore & Lenn, 1972), and also by an indirect connection from the intergeniculate leaflet of the thalamus (Swanson *et al.*, 1974; Ribak & Peters, 1975). The photic cue delivered by the RHT is both essential and sufficient for the entrainment of the circadian clock to the daily light–dark cycle (Moore, 1983).

The primary neurotransmitter utilized by the RHT is glutamate (Kim & Dudek, 1991; Colwell & Menaker, 1992; Ebling, 1996). Activation of glutamate receptors in SCN neurons by light stimulus presented during the nocturnal phase produces a wide array of postsynaptic events that lead to the resetting of the circadian clock. The increase in cytosolic Ca²⁺ concentration, which is considered to be the central event, results from Ca²⁺ influx through ionotropic glutamate receptors (Colwell, 2001), from the internal mobilization of Ca²⁺ (Ding *et al.*, 1998; Hamada *et al.*, 1999) and/or from the activation of voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs; Huang, 1993; Chen & van den Pol, 1998; Cloues & Sather, 2003).

Previous studies on the marine mollusks *Bulla* and *Aplysia* indicated that VGCCs play a critical role in light-induced circadian clock resetting (Khalsa & Block, 1988; Colwell *et al.*, 1994); however, the similar role of VGCCs has not yet been detected in mammals. Throughout this communication, we present evidence that VGCCs play important roles in the glutamate-induced phase resetting of rat circadian clock, T- and L-type VGCCs being more important for phase delays and advances, respectively. In addition, we present results supporting the notion that the differential contribution of T-type VGCC to the phase delays and advances may have something to do with a nocturnal modulation of T-type Ca²⁺ current in retinorecipient SCN neurons.

## Materials and methods

### Animals and housing

Male Sprague–Dawley rats (*n* = 130; 100–200 g) purchased from Daehan Experimental Animal (Eumsung, Korea) were used for this
study. The experimental procedures were approved by the Korea University College of Medicine Animal Research Policies Committee while conforming to the US National Institutes of Health guidelines. Before electrophysiological experiments, the animals were housed in temperature-controlled rooms (22–24 °C) with a 12 : 12 h light/dark schedule for at least 1 week. Zeitgeber time (ZT) 0.00 h was designated as the time of lights-on and ZT 12.00 h as the time of lights-off in the colony.

### Brain slice preparation

Slices were prepared during the day (ZT 10.30–11.30 h) to avoid undesired phase shifts. The rats were anaesthetized with sodium pentobarbitone (100 mg/kg, ip), and the brain was quickly excised and submerged in ice-cold physiological saline [(in mM): NaCl, 124; MgSO₄, 1.3; KCl, 3; NaH₂PO₄, 1.25; NaHCO₃, 26; CaCl₂, 2.4; D(+)-glucose, 10; pH 7.4; osmolality: 295–310 mOsm/kg]. After about 1 min of chilling, the brain was trimmed to a block (about 0.3 × 0.3 × 0.3 cm) containing the SCN. With the use of a vibroslicer (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL, USA), brain slices (400–500 μm thickness) were cut from the tissue block in the coronal orientation. During the slicing, the tissue was maintained in ice-cold physiological saline. The slice containing the SCN was transferred to a modified Haas-type gas interface recording chamber (Haas *et al.*, 1979) and superfused, at a rate of 0.4 mL/min, with warm physiological saline (35 °C, pH 7.4) supplemented with gentamicin (50 mg/L). This solution was continuously aerated with 95% O₂/5% CO₂. Warm air (35 °C) humidified by the same gas mixture was also continuously blown over the slice to further ensure adequate oxygenation of the cells in the tissue.

dorsomedial regions of the SCN at ZT 12–16 h and ZT 20–24 h on the very day of slice preparation. These experiments were conducted while superfusing the slice with a warm (35 °C), aerated (95% O₂/5% CO₂) external solution at a rate of 1–2 mL/min. Physiological saline, containing 0.03 mM bicuculline methiodide, was used as the external solution in studying T-type Ca²⁺ currents. On the other hand, for L-type Ca²⁺ currents, an external solution containing (in mM) NaCl, 60.0; tetraethylammonium chloride, 60.0; CsCl, 3.0; 4-aminopyridine, 5.0; MgSO₄, 1.3; KCl, 3; NaH₂PO₄, 1.25; NaHCO₃, 26; CaCl₂, 2.4; D(+)-glucose, 10; bicuculline methiodide, 0.03; tetrodotoxin, 0.001 (pH 7.4; osmolality 298–310 mOsm/kg) was used. The micropipettes (tip diameter: ~2.0 μm; resistance: 3–4 MΩ) used to record T-type Ca²⁺ currents were filled with an internal solution composed of (in mM): K-gluconate, 140; HEPES, 10; MgCl₂, 2; CaCl₂, 1; EGTA, 11; K₂ATP, 2 (pH 7.3; osmolality 285–290 mOsm/kg), and the micropipettes used to record L-type Ca²⁺ currents were filled with a solution that was composed of (in mM): CsCl, 115.0; tetraethylammonium chloride, 20.0; HEPES, 10.0; MgCl₂, 2.0; EGTA, 0.5; Na₂ATP, 2.0; Na₃GTP, 0.3; sodium phosphocreatine, 20.0 (pH 7.3; osmolality: 285–290 mOsm/kg). Whole-cell currents, recorded in continuous voltage-clamp mode, were filtered at 3 kHz and digitized every 100 μs using Axoclamp-2B amplifier and pCLAMP 6 or 8 data acquisition/analysis software (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA, USA). The voltage error (maximum: 2 mV) and the liquid–liquid junction potential (−5 mV) are not corrected for the data presented in the Results. Leak currents were subtracted with the use of a method called P/N Leak Subtraction (pCLAMP 6 or 8 data acquisition/analysis software).

### Drugs

All the drugs and chemicals used in this study were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA), unless stated otherwise. Stock solutions were prepared by dissolving glutamate and mibefradil (T-type Ca²⁺ channel blocker) in physiological saline, nimodipine (L-type Ca²⁺ channel blocker) in ethanol, and amiloride-HCl (T-type Ca²⁺ channel blocker) and ω-conotoxin MVIIIC (NPQ-type Ca²⁺ channel blocker; Tocris, England) in dimethyl sulphoxide. These solutions were diluted with physiological saline to the following concentrations (in μM) just before utilization: glutamate, 100; mibefradil, 1; nimodipine, 2; amiloride-HCl, 100; ω-conotoxin MVIIIC, 3. The final concentrations (in vol%) of ethanol and dimethyl sulphoxide were ≤0.05%. The concentrations of VGCC blockers were adopted as above, as other investigators reported that: (i) mibefradil blocked T-type Ca²⁺ channels expressed in HEK293 cells with an IC₅₀ of ~0.8 μM and with a much greater affinity (50–100-fold) for T-than L-type Ca²⁺ channels (Martin *et al.*, 2000); (ii) nimodipine, at 10 μM concentration, profoundly blocked L-type Ca²⁺ channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes, but it obstructed only slightly (<10%) N-, P/Q- and R-type Ca²⁺ channels (Furukawa *et al.*, 1999); (iii) ω-conotoxin MVIIIC, at 2 μM concentration, blocked the bulk of N-, P- and Q-type Ca²⁺ currents in rat central and peripheral neurons, with no effect on L-type Ca²⁺ current even at 10 μM (McDonough *et al.*, 1996), and (iv) amiloride suppressed strongly T-type Ca²⁺ currents in mouse neuroblastoma cells with an IC₅₀ of ~30 μM, whereas it exerted a weak (<20%) inhibitory effect on high-threshold Ca²⁺ current at concentrations >500 μM (Tang *et al.*, 1988). We thought that the mibefradil, nimodipine and ω-conotoxin MVIIIC would work with a reasonable selectivity and efficacy at the adopted concentrations. On the other hand, we were afraid that amiloride might be non-selective because this agent was reported to block ATP-sensitive K⁺ channel and amiloride-sensitive Na⁺ channel as well, with an IC₅₀ in the range of

### Experiment I: assessment of the roles of VGCCs in the glutamate-induced phase shifts of circadian firing activity rhythms of SCN neurons

On the first day *in vitro*, the slice was superfused with a solution containing glutamate and/or VGCC blocker(s) or left untreated. The application of glutamate began either at ZT 14.00 h (i.e. early night) or ZT 22.00 h (i.e. late night) and lasted for 30 min. The application of VGCC blockers started at ZT 13.50 h or ZT 21.50 h and lasted for 50 min. On the following day, extracellular single-unit recordings in the SCN were obtained between ZT 0.00 and 13.00 h, each unit being recorded for a 1-min period. Usually 10 units were sampled every hour (range: 7–15 units). The recordings were conducted with the use of 3 M NaCl (pH 7.4)-filled electrodes (4–5 MΩ) and without restricting the electrode tip position to any particular region of the SCN. To detect the time-of-peak of circadian firing activity rhythm of SCN neurons, which is a reliable marker of clock phase (Chen *et al.*, 1999), we plotted against ZT the mean firing rates of units sampled for sequential 2-h periods with 1-h lags: i.e. we plotted the mean firing rate of units recorded from ZT 0.00 to 2.00 h at ZT 1.00 h, the mean firing rate of units encountered from ZT 1.00 to 3.00 h at ZT 2.00 h, etc. In order to quantify the phase shift induced by a drug treatment, we compared the time-of-peak detected in the drug-treated slice with the average time-of-peak of control slices (dashed vertical lines in Figs 1 and 2). The difference was taken as the amount of drug-induced phase shift.

### Experiment II: recording of T- and L-type Ca²⁺ currents

Whole-cell recordings (series resistance: 6–12 MΩ) of T- and L-type Ca²⁺ currents were obtained from neurons in the ventrolateral and
0.5–100 μM (Schaefer *et al.*, 2000; Bollensdorff *et al.*, 2001) (see Results).

### Statistical analyses

Numerical data are expressed as the mean ± SEM. Student’s *t*-test or Mann–Whitney *U*-test was conducted in order to compare two different experimental groups, and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to determine the presence of significant variance among data from three different experimental groups. Following one-way ANOVA, pair-wise comparisons of different experimental groups were conducted with Tukey tests. *P* < 0.05 was considered to be significant.

### Results

#### VGCC blocker cocktail completely obstructed both the phase delays and advances

Figure 1 illustrates the glutamate-induced phase delay and advance of circadian firing activity rhythms of SCN neurons and the effects of a VGCC blocker cocktail (i.e., a mixture of amiloride, nimodipine and ω-conotoxin MVIIIC) on these phase shifts. In control slices, which were left untreated on the first day *in vitro*, the peaks of circadian firing activity rhythms were detected at ZT 5–6 h (ZT 5.8 ± 0.32 h for six control slices used in phase-delay experiments, Fig. 1A; ZT 5.8 ± 0.20 h for five control slices used in phase-advance experiments, Fig. 1B). However, in slices treated with glutamate in the early and late night, the peaks were detected at ZT 9 h (ZT 9.0 ± 0.0 h, *n* = 5 slices, Fig. 1C) and ZT 2–4 h (ZT 3.5 ± 0.34 h, *n* = 6 slices, Fig. 1D), respectively. These results indicate that the glutamate treatments induced a phase delay and a phase advance, respectively, as in earlier studies (for review, see Gillette & Mitchell, 2002); these shifts (amount of delay: 3.2 ± 0.00 h; amount of advance: 2.3 ± 0.34 h) were statistically significant.

Figures 1E–H and 3 show that the VGCC blocker cocktail alone had no phase-shifting effect, but it completely blocked the glutamate-induced phase shifts: in the presence of the VGCC blocker cocktail, glutamate failed to induce any significant phase delays [control (0.0 ± 0.32 h, *n* = 6) = glutamate + cocktail (−0.3 ± 0.22 h, *n* = 6) < glutamate (3.2 ± 0.00 h, *n* = 5)] or advances [control (0.0 ± 0.20 h, *n* = 5) = glutamate + cocktail (0.5 ± 0.21 h, *n* = 6) < glutamate (2.3 ± 0.34 h, *n* = 6)].

#### Effects of individual VGCC blockers on phase delays and advances

Because the preceding results indicated that VGCCs play crucial roles in the phase shifts induced by glutamate, we next assessed the

respective roles of T-, L- and NPQ-type Ca²⁺ channels by examining the effects of amiloride, nimodipine, ω-conotoxin MVIIIC on the glutamate-induced phase delays and advances. As illustrated in Figs 2 and 3, the T-type Ca²⁺ channel antagonist amiloride completely blocked the phase delays [control (0.0 ± 0.32 h, n = 6) = glutamate + amiloride (0.4 ± 0.20 h, n = 5) < glutamate (3.2 ± 0.00 h, n = 5)], and it had little or no effect on the advances [control (0.0 ± 0.20 h, n = 5) < glutamate + amiloride (1.8 ± 0.00 h, n = 5) = glutamate (2.3 ± 0.34 h, n = 6)]. On the other hand, the L-type Ca²⁺ channel antagonist nimodipine completely blocked the advances [control (0.0 ± 0.20 h, n = 5) = glutamate + nimodipine (0.3 ± 0.22 h, n = 6) < glutamate (2.3 ± 0.34 h, n = 6)], with partial inhibitory effects on the delays [control (0.0 ± 0.32 h, n = 6) < glutamate + nimodipine (1.2 ± 0.26 h, n = 6) < glutamate (3.2 ± 0.00 h, n = 5)]. The NPQ-type Ca²⁺ channel blocker ω-conotoxin MVIIIC exerted a strong inhibitory effect on both the delays [control (0.0 ± 0.32 h, n = 6) = glutamate + conotoxin (1.0 ± 0.37 h, n = 5) < glutamate (3.2 ± 0.00 h, n = 5)] and the advances [control (0.0 ± 0.20 h, n = 5) = glutamate + conotoxin (0.8 ± 0.32 h, n = 6) < glutamate (2.3 ± 0.34 h, n = 6)].

Amiloride, an agent that was employed in this study as a T-type Ca²⁺ channel antagonist, is known to block ATP-sensitive K⁺ channel (Bollensdorff et al., 2001) and amiloride-sensitive Na⁺ channel (Schaefer et al., 2000) with IC₅₀s in the range of 0.5–100 µM. Thus, to ensure that the observed effects of amiloride were indeed the consequences of T-type Ca²⁺ channel blockade, we conducted further experiments with mibefradil, a VGCC blocker known to be selective for low, over high-threshold, Ca²⁺ channels at low concentrations (Martin et al., 2000). Foremost confirming that mibefradil, at 1 µM concentration, substantially blocked low-threshold inward currents (i.e. T-type Ca²⁺ currents) without altering high-threshold inward currents in SCN neurons (Fig. 4), we continued examining the effects of this drug on the glutamate-induced phase shifts. At the same concentration as above, mibefradil completely blocked the phase delays [control (0.0 ± 0.32 h, n = 6) = glutamate + mibefradil (−0.1 ± 0.52 h, n = 7) < glutamate (3.2 ± 0.00 h, n = 5)], with little or no effect on the phase advances [control (0.0 ± 0.20 h, n = 5) < glutamate + mibefradil (2.0 ± 0.48 h, n = 6) = glutamate (2.3 ± 0.34 h, n = 6)]

(Figs 2I, 2J and 3). Mibefradil alone had no phase-shifting effect (Figs 2K and 3A).

Nocturnal modulation of VGCC currents in SCN neurons

The differential involvement of T- and L-type VGCCs in the phase delays and advances indicated by the prior mentioned might be related to the nocturnal modulation of their currents. Hence, T- and L-type Ca²⁺ currents measured in the early night (ZT 12–16 h) were compared with those measured in the late night (ZT 20–24 h). The transient inward current evoked by a voltage step (300 ms) to −50 mV from a holding of −90 mV was regarded as T-type Ca²⁺ current (e.g., see the ‘control’ trace of Fig. 4A), as T-type Ca²⁺ channels are mostly inactivated near the resting potential, deinactivated by hyperpolarizations and activated by small depolarizations (i.e. low voltage-activated) in deinactivated states, and because their currents during a sustained voltage pulse are transient due to the rapidly inactivating channel property (for review, see Perez-Reyes, 2002). As L-type Ca²⁺

current, the nimodipine (2 μM)-sensitive component of inward current evoked by a voltage step to 0 mV from a holding of -50 mV was considered, as L-type Ca²⁺ channels are dihydropyridine-sensitive, high voltage-activated and do not inactivate much near the resting potential, unlike T-type Ca²⁺ channels (Hille, 2001). Figure 5 illustrates that T-type Ca²⁺ currents recorded in neurons in the ventrolateral region of the SCN (i.e. retinorecipient zone) were significantly larger in the early than late night, whereas those recorded in the dorsomedial region of the SCN did not significantly differ from early to late night. Figure 5 also indicates that L-type Ca²⁺ currents were not different between early and late night in both the dorsomedial and ventrolateral regions.

As a means to determine the source of early vs. late night difference in T-type Ca²⁺ current magnitude, we further compared early and late night neurons in terms of cell capacitance (i.e. an index of cell size) and the voltage dependence of steady-state inactivation and activation of T-type Ca²⁺ current. Cell capacitance was not significantly different between early and late night neurons (47.2 ± 2.2 pF, $n = 30$ vs. 44.8 ± 1.5 pF, $n = 36$). Likewise, the half-inactivating/activating potential ($V_{1/2}$) and the steepness constant ($k$) were not significantly different from early to late night neurons [$V_{1/2}$ and $k$ of inactivation: -73.8 ± 2.3 mV and -5.5 ± 1.9 ($n = 7$; early) vs. -74.1 ± 1.1 mV and -5.2 ± 1.8 ($n = 6$; late); $V_{1/2}$ and $k$ of activation: -53.5 ± 1.4 mV and 3.7 ± 0.3 ($n = 5$; early) vs. -47.8 ± 3.0 mV and 5.1 ± 1.0 ($n = 7$; late)] (Fig. 6).

### Discussion

The elevation of cytosolic Ca²⁺ level in SCN neurons is thought to be a key step toward the light-induced resetting of the circadian clock in mammals (Ding et al., 1994, 1998). Although VGCCs can contribute to the Ca²⁺ rise and thus the resetting of the clock, this possibility has not yet been explored experimentally. In this study, we demonstrated that a cocktail of T-, L and NPQ-type VGCC antagonists applied to rat SCN slices completely blocked the glutamate-induced phase shifts of circadian firing activity rhythms of SCN neurons. Further, we showed that: (i) amiloride and mibefradil (T-type antagonists) completely blocked the delays but had little or no effects on the advances; (ii) nimodipine (L-type antagonist) completely obstructed the advances while inhibiting the delays moderately; and (iii) ω-conotoxin MVIIIC (NPQ-type antagonist) blocked substantially, if not entirely, both the delays and advances. These results suggest that VGCCs in the SCN play significant roles in the glutamate-induced phase resetting of the mammalian circadian clock. More specifically, they suggest that: (i) T-type VGCC is more important for phase delay while L-type is so for phase advance; and (ii) N-, P- or Q-type VGCC, or a certain combination(s) of these channels is (are) important for phase delays and advances.

Why are T- and L-type VGCCs differentially involved in the phase delays and advances? An answer may be that T-type channels are linked more closely than L-type channels are to the events that lead to phase delays such as the release of intracellular Ca²⁺ through rynodine receptors (Ding et al., 1998), whereas L-type channels are linked more intimately than T-type channels are to the phase advance-producing events like the activation of a guanylyl cyclase-cGMP-protein kinase G signalling pathway (Weber et al., 1995; Mathur et al., 1996; Ding et al., 1998). The reason T- and L-type VGCCs are differentially involved in the phase delays and advances may also be that calcium currents flowing through these channels wax and wane during nighttime so that T-type Ca²⁺ current may increase in the early night, a time period during which glutamate induces phase delays, while L-type Ca²⁺ current may be enhanced in the late night, a time domain where glutamate induces phase advances.

In the present study we checked the latter possibility, as a recent report by Pennartz et al. (2002) has suggested that L-type VGCC currents in SCN neurons are modulated in a circadian time-dependent fashion. What we detected was twofold: (i) T-type Ca²⁺ currents were not significantly different in amplitude between early and late night neurons recorded in the dorsomedial region of the SCN, but they were twice as large in early night neurons recorded in the ventrolateral

region of the SCN, the retinorecipient zone; and (ii) the amplitudes of L-type Ca²⁺ currents were not different between early and late night neurons, regardless of the recording site. These findings support the notion that the differential involvement of T-type VGCC in the phase delays and advances may be related to a nocturnal modulation of the channel current in retinorecipient SCN neurons. Whereas, they contradict the idea that a nocturnal modulation of L-type Ca²⁺ current underlies the differential contribution of L-type VGCC to the phase delays and advances.

The mechanism underlying the nocturnal modulation of T-type Ca²⁺ current is unclear. The results of the whole-cell patch-clamp experiments, however, indicate that the nocturnal modulation is not subsequent to the sampling bias for larger cells in the early night. Furthermore, the results indicate that the nocturnal modulation does not arise from a change in steady-state inactivation or activation kinetics of T-type Ca²⁺ channels. Whether it results from the alteration of the number and/or certain properties of T-type channels remains to be determined.

FIG. 6. Steady-state inactivation (A) and activation (B) of T-type Ca²⁺ currents recorded in the early and late night. To obtain inactivation curves, cells were depolarized in a step to –45 mV after various conditioning steps ranging from –110 to –50 mV with a 5-mV increment (inset in A). For activation curves, currents were evoked by depolarization to potentials between –95 and –45 mV in steps of 5 mV from a holding potential of –100 mV (inset in B). Some currents used for the plot in (B) were evoked by test pulses to –53, –47 or –43 mV. The curves in (A) and (B) were fitted with the Boltzmann equation: \( I/I_{\text{max}} = 1 / \{1 + \exp[(V - V_{1/2}) / k]\} \), where \( I_{\text{max}} \) is the maximum current obtained, \( V_{1/2} \) is the half-inactivating/activating potential and \( k \) is the steepness constant. \( n \), number of cells from which data were obtained.

The selectivity of the T-type VGCC blocker amiloride utilized in this study is an issue that requires discussion. Because this drug, at the adopted concentration (i.e. 100 µM), could block ATP-sensitive K⁺ channels (Bollensdorff et al., 2001) and amiloride-sensitive Na⁺ channels (Schaefer et al., 2000) as well as T-type Ca²⁺ channels, we further assessed the effects of mibefradil, another T-type VGCC blocker. This agent, although structurally unrelated to amiloride, exerted essentially the same effects as those of amiloride; at a concentration (1 µM) selective for T-type Ca²⁺ current (Fig. 4), mibefradil completely blocked glutamate-induced phase delays with little or no effects on phase advances. This finding suggests that the effects of amiloride and mibefradil arose from selective blockade of T-type Ca²⁺ channels.

A recent study, motivated by a paper describing a beneficial effect of calcium antagonists against age-associated decline of cognition (de

Jonge & Traber, 1993), examined whether nimodipine might also be beneficial to enhance the phase-shifting effect of light (Benloucif *et al.*, 2003). This study, contrary to our finding, reported that the drug potentiated light-induced phase delay of the circadian activity rhythm of the mouse. The disparity between our results and those of Benloucif *et al.* (2003) might be related to the difference in drug delivery route; we applied the compound directly to the SCN slices, whereas they administered the agent to the mouse subcutaneously. Thus, it is possible that their nimodipine effect arose from its action at sites other than the SCN. In fact, they reported that the nimodipine treatment did not alter the light-induced c-fos mRNA expression in the SCN and, therefore, the nimodipine effect on light-induced phase delay might not be through the SCN.

In summary, to assess the possible roles of VGCCs in photic resetting of the mammalian circadian clock, we conducted electrophysiological experiments using rat SCN slices and VGCC blockers. Our results suggest that VGCCs in the SCN play significant roles in the glutamate-induced phase resetting of the suprachiasmatic circadian clock and that different types of VGCCs contribute differentially to the phase delays and advances of the clock. In addition, the results point to the possibility that a nocturnal modulation of T-type Ca²⁺ current in retinorecipient SCN neurons is related to the differential contribution of T-type Ca²⁺ channels to the phase delays and advances.
