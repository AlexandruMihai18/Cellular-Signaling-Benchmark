**Objectives:** Although methotrexate (MTX) is the anchor drug in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), patients experience clinical resistance to MTX upon prolonged treatment. We explored whether new-generation antifolates elicit superior anti-inflammatory properties when compared to MTX, based on their capacity to inhibit tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α production.

**Method:** T cells in whole blood from 18 RA patients (including MTX-naive, MTX-responsive, and MTX non-responsive patients) and seven healthy volunteers were stimulated with αCD3/αCD28 antibodies and incubated ex vivo for 72 h with MTX and eight novel antifolate drugs with potentially favourable biochemical and pharmacological properties. Drug concentrations exerting 50% inhibition (IC-50) of TNF-α production (by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, ELISA) were determined as an estimate for their anti-inflammatory capacity. In addition, induction of T-cell apoptosis was evaluated by flow cytometry.

**Results:** The new-generation antifolates PT523, PT644, raltitrexed, and GW1843 proved to be potent inhibitors of TNF-α production in activated T cells from all three groups of RA patients and from healthy volunteers. Based on IC-50 values, these antifolates were up to 10.3 times more potent than MTX. The anti-inflammatory effects were observed at drug concentrations that provoked suppression of T-cell activation and induction of apoptosis in 20–40% of activated T cells.

**Conclusion:** In an ex-vivo setting, novel antifolates elicited marked inhibition of TNF-α production in activated T cells from RA patients. Further clinical evaluation is warranted to investigate whether a low dosage of these antifolates can elicit immunosuppressive effects equivalent to MTX, and whether they are superior to MTX in patients who fail to respond to MTX.

For many decades the folate antagonist methotrexate (MTX) has served an anchor role in the treatment of neoplastic diseases (1) and of chronic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (2). The molecular basis of the anti-proliferative activity of MTX relies on inhibition of key enzymes in folate metabolism, that is dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and thymidylate synthase (TS), along with folate-dependent enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis (3). Anti-proliferative properties of MTX may also be of relevance in RA treatment, but the anti-inflammatory properties of MTX have been most strongly related to its ability to block the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α or interleukin (IL)-1β (4). Multiple mechanisms for these MTX-induced anti-inflammatory effects have been postulated (2, 4–6) including: (a) extracellular release of adenosine by inhibition of the de-novo purine biosynthesis enzyme aminoimidazole carboxamide ribonucleotide transformylase (AICARTFase), transducing anti-inflammatory signalling via adenosine receptors (7–9), (b) inhibition of the first enzyme in de novo purine biosynthesis, amidophosphoribosyltransferase (10), (c) apoptosis of activated T cells (11) and generation of reactive oxygen species in conjunction with c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation (12–14), (d) inhibition of methyltransferases leading to impairment of Ras signalling (15), and/or (e) inhibition of the activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), which controls the transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines (16).

Despite the potent anti-rheumatic capacity of MTX, approximately 50% of RA patients ultimately experience clinical resistance to MTX during chronic therapy (17). Little is known about the mechanism(s) of MTX resistance in RA patients (18), although overlapping mechanisms of MTX resistance identified in cancer cells may play a role: (a) down-regulation of the reduced folate carrier (RFC) leading to impaired cellular uptake of MTX, (b) decreased cellular retention of MTX due to impaired

polyglutamylation by folylpolyglutamate synthetase (FPGS), (c) elevated levels of DHFR and TS, the target enzymes of MTX, (d) enhanced cellular efflux of MTX by specific members of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) family of drug efflux transporters, and/or (e) increased folate levels that compete with MTX for target enzyme binding and polyglutamylation (19–24).

The extensive knowledge regarding the molecular mechanisms underlying resistance to MTX has facilitated the rational design of new-generation antifolate drugs. In this respect, second- and third-generation folate antagonists exhibit one or more of the following characteristics: (a) they are transported more efficiently via the RFC, (b) they have higher affinity for FPGS or are independent of polyglutamylation for their pharmacological activity, (c) they have the ability to target other enzymes in the folate metabolic pathway apart from DHFR; for example TS and glyciamide ribonucleotide transformylase (GARTFase), (d) they exhibit poor affinity for drug efflux transporters, and (e) they retain cytotoxic activity regardless of intracellular folate status (reviewed in 19, 25).

The current study was undertaken to assess the anti-inflammatory effects of a selected set of these new-

generation antifolates. To this end, we investigated the ability of these novel antifolates to suppress the release of the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-α from activated T cells in whole blood cells derived from RA patients, including those who were clinically refractory to MTX.

### Method

#### Patient characteristics

All patients included in this study signed an informed consent form and the study on 'DMARD resistance' was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of the VU University Medical Centre, Amsterdam, The Netherlands (no. 04.061). All patients fulfilled the American College of Rheumatology (ACR; formerly the American College of Rheumatism Association) 1987 revised criteria for RA and were on stable doses of MTX (15–30 mg/week) for at least 3 months. Newly diagnosed RA patients, who were not yet receiving disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), were included as MTX-naive patients. Eighteen RA patients (five males, 13 females) with a mean age of 52 years were included in this study; they had a mean Disease Activity Score using 28 joint counts (DAS28) of 4.3 (range 1.3–7.2). Five patients were

MTX naive and 13 patients were receiving MTX; RA patients were defined as MTX non-responders if they had a DAS28 score > 3.2 at the time of enrolment (n = 7), and patients with a DAS28 score ≤ 3.2 were defined as MTX responders (n = 6). In addition, seven healthy volunteers (four males, three females) with a mean age of 38 years were included in the study.

Drugs

MTX was a kind gift from Pharmachemie, Haarlem, The Netherlands. Pemetrexed/ALIMTA® (Eli Lilly, Houten, The Netherlands) was obtained from the Vrije Universiteit Medical Centre (VUmc) Pharmacy Department. The following antifolate drugs were obtained from the companies/institutions indicated: raltitrexed/Tomudex®/ZD1694 (26) (Astra-Zeneca, UK), PT523 (talotrexin), and PT644 (27, 28) (Dr A. Rosowsky, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA), GW1843 (29) (Glaxo-Welcome, USA), TMQ (trimetrexate/Neutrexin®; MedImmune Pharma, The Netherlands) (1, 25), plevitrexed/BGC9331 (30) (BTG International Ltd, UK), and AG2037 (31) (Agouron/Pfizer, San Diego, CA, USA). The chemical structures of these folate antagonists are provided in the online Supplementary Figure S1. A schematic overview of their targets in folate metabolism is depicted in Figure 1. Properties regarding the affinities of these drugs for the RFC and FPGS are depicted in Table 1.

T-cell activation and TNF-α enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) procedures

Whole blood samples from 18 RA patients and seven healthy volunteers were collected in heparin-containing tubes that were confirmed to be endotoxin free (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA, USA). Blood was diluted 1:10 with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with heparin (15 U/mL), penicillin/streptomycin (100 μg/mL), and 0.1% foetal calf serum, and

incubated ex vivo with αCD3/αCD28 antibodies (0.1 and 1 μg/mL, respectively) as T-cell activating agents, as described previously (32). Antifolates were then added at seven concentrations (range 0–300 nM), followed by an incubation period of 72 h. Inhibition of TNF-α production was measured after 72 h drug exposure using an ELISA as described previously (32). The antifolate concentration required to inhibit TNF-α production by 50% is defined as the anti-inflammatory IC-50 concentration.

Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of RA patients were isolated by Ficoll-Paque Plus density centrifugation and suspended in DMEM supplemented with 10% autologous donor serum. Apoptosis in PBMCs was determined by flow cytometry after 72 h exposure to MTX and novel antifolate drugs, using Annexin-V fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)/7-aminoactinomycin D (7-AAD) staining (APOPTESTTM-FITC A700, VPS Diagnostics, Hoeven, The Netherlands) according to the manufacturer's protocol. At the highest drug concentrations, 2 μM of the natural reduced folate (6S)-5-formyltetrahydrofolate/leucovorin (Merck Eprova, Schaffhausen, Switzerland) was added to test folate competition-induced prevention of apoptosis. Phycoerythrin-labelled anti-CD25 (Becton Dickinson) was used for monitoring of T-cell activation.

T-cell isolation

PBMCs of three healthy donors were purified by Percoll density centrifugation followed by depletion of monocytes, granulocytes, and B cells by incubation with αCD14 (CLB-CD14), αCD16 (CLB-RcRgran1), and αCD19 (CLB-CD19), respectively, followed by separation with immunomagnetic beads (Dynabeads-M450, Dynal AS, Oslo, Norway) according to the manufacturer's protocol. T-cell stimulation in the PBMC and isolated T-cell cultures (40 000 cells/well) was performed as described above.

Statistical analysis

Statistical analysis was performed using non-parametric tests. For determining significant differences in anti-inflammatory IC-50 for novel antifolate drugs compared to MTX, a two-tailed Mann-Whitney test was used. A p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Results

Novel antifolate drugs are potent inhibitors of TNF-α production by activated T cells from healthy volunteers and RA patients

To determine whether the novel folate antagonists could elicit potential anti-inflammatory effects, we tested the

ability of these antifolates to inhibit TNF-α production by activated T cells in whole blood cultures of healthy controls and RA patients, including MTX-naive, MTX-responsive, and MTX non-responsive patients (Table 1). TNF-α levels were determined after 72 h of continuous drug exposure because at this time T-cell activation seemed to be optimal according to CD25 expression (Figure 2).

Basal levels of TNF-α production after T-cell stimulation were not significantly different between the healthy controls (3208 ± 2554 pg/mL) and RA patients (3400 ± 2818 pg/mL). Control experiments confirmed (see online Supplementary Figure S2) that T cells were the dominant source of TNF-α release. Four antifolates (PT523, PT644, raltitrexed, and GW1843) could be identified with a significantly enhanced potency (up to 10-fold) compared with MTX in RA T cells, two had comparable activity (pemetrexed, BGC9331), whereas two (TMQ and AG2037) were significantly less potent (up to 4-fold) than MTX (Table 1). In general, IC-50 values for inhibition of TNF-α release were lower for healthy volunteers than RA patients, but these differences only reached statistical significance for the TS inhibitors raltitrexed and GW1843 (p < 0.05; data not shown). Of note, when compared to healthy controls, five patients within the total group of 18 RA patients (equally distributed among RA subgroups) were less sensitive to MTX and to most of the antifolate drugs (data not shown). A slightly greater potency in suppressing TNF-α production was observed for all antifolates in the group of MTX-treated RA patients compared to MTX-naive patients (not statistically significant). Lack of clinical responsiveness to MTX was not reflected by higher IC-50 values in the whole blood assay; T cells from clinically MTX refractory RA patients were equally sensitive to MTX compared to T cells from MTX-responsive RA patients. Similarly, T cells derived from MTX non-responsive RA patients were as sensitive to each of the eight novel antifolate drugs as T cells from MTX-responsive RA patients.

MTX and novel antifolates induce apoptosis in activated (CD25+) but not in resting (CD25−) T cells and attenuated T-cell activation

As one of the proposed mechanisms of action of low-dose MTX is induction of apoptosis in autoreactive T cells (11), we evaluated the onset of apoptosis in PBMC cultures derived from three drug-naive RA patients after exposure to MTX and novel antifolates. Upon stimulation with αCD3/CD28, polyclonal expansion of T cells was observed microscopically between 48 and 72 h along with a 1.5–2-fold increase in cell counts. For all antifolates tested, we observed a dose-dependent decrease in CD25+ cells, which was partially independent of apoptosis (Figure 3; white bars). Furthermore, we observed apoptosis in up to 70% of activated (CD25+) T cells (Figure 3; dark grey bars), but not in resting (CD25−) T cells (Figure 3; light grey bars). To verify the role of apoptosis in inhibition of TNF-α production by activated T cells, we determined the level of

PBMCs of RA patients were stimulated with αCD3/αCD28 for 72 h in the absence or presence of MTX and new-generation antifolate drugs. FACS analysis was used to monitor T-cell activation (CD25 expression) and apoptosis induction (Annexin-V/7AAD staining). Tested drugs include: DHFR inhibitors (A) MTX, (B) PT523, (C) PT644, (D) TMQ; TS inhibitors (E) raltitrexed, (F) pemetrexed, (G) GW1843, (H) BGC9331; and the GARTFase inhibitor (I) AG2037. White bars represent the percentage of activated (CD25+) T cells; light grey bars represent the percentage of apoptotic (Annexin-V+/7AAD+) cells in the CD25– cell population; dark grey bars show the percentage of apoptotic (Annexin-V+/7AAD+) cells in the CD25+ cell population. At the highest drug concentrations, reversibility of apoptosis was tested by addition of 2 μM of the natural folate leucovorin. The results depicted represent the mean ± SD of three separate experiments.

apoptosis at the IC-50 concentration for TNF-α inhibition in RA whole blood for all nine antifolate drugs. As shown in Figure 4, at the antifolate IC-50 value for inhibition of TNF-α production, 20–40% apoptosis was observed in activated (CD25+) T cells, except for PT523, which exhibited a more apoptosis-independent anti-inflammatory effect. Addition of the natural reduced folate leucovorin (2 μM) partially abrogated the induction of apoptosis and inhibition of T-cell activation by MTX, PT523, TMQ, raltitrexed, and pemetrexed, suggesting competitive transport and/or polyglutamylation effects with these antifolates. No rescue effect of leucovorin was observed for PT644, GW1843, BGC9331, and AG2037, suggesting that the activity of these antifolates is not influenced in high folate conditions (Figure 3).

Discussion

The current study demonstrates that a panel of new-generation antifolates (19, 25) shares with MTX the ability to exert potential anti-inflammatory effects by suppressing the production of TNF-α by activated T cells

in whole blood from RA patients. Moreover, the study indicates that induction of apoptosis in activated T cells by antifolates may explain, at least in part, the anti-inflammatory properties as described previously for MTX (11, 33, 34). Finally, we observed an attenuation of T-cell activation at low concentrations of antifolates, an effect that was partially unrelated to induction of apoptosis. This latter observation might be consistent with the additional mechanisms of action elicited by MTX and other antifolates (5, 9, 16).

A marked inter-patient variability was observed in the anti-inflammatory activity of these novel antifolates that could not be related to differences in basal levels of TNF-α production or clinical response to MTX treatment. However, the whole blood assay (32) proved to be a useful clinical surrogate in assessment of differential potencies of drugs as described here for a series of folate antagonists. Nonetheless, we showed that, besides T cells, monocytes are contributors to TNF-α production in this assay, probably because they are stimulated by cytokines, including IL-17, produced by activated T cells (35).

T cells from apoptosis induced by MTX, TMQ, raltitrexed, pemetrexed and, to some extent PT 523, whereas the efficacy of PT 644, BGC 9331, and GW 1843 was not influenced by this reduced folate. Future studies should attempt to further quantify, for each individual antifolate, the differential antagonizing effect of leucovorin and/or folic acid over a broader concentration range. On top of the high folate levels, exogenous purines may also bypass the inhibitory effects of AICARTFase and GARTFase inhibitors (42). Consequently, the presence of exogenous purines/pyrimidines in whole blood samples of RA patients could have attenuated the efficacy of the GARTFase inhibitor AG2037 in this study, as shown in Figure 4.

Based on these considerations, it is likely that an enhanced therapeutic antifolate effect may be elicited by novel antifolates with the following properties: (a) high affinity for the RFC and (b) being less affected in their pharmacological activity by fluctuations in the patient's folate status. The antifolate drugs identified in the present study that harbour these features are PT 644, GW 1843, and BGC 9331. With respect to the non-polyglutamatable folate antagonists PT 523, PT 644, and BGC 9331, it should be taken into account that continuous drug exposure will be required for their optimal activity, as they may otherwise be rapidly extruded from cells when short-term exposure is followed by a drug-free period (18, 19, 25).

Another issue in the pharmacokinetics of MTX compared to novel antifolate drugs is their efficiency of intestinal absorption after oral administration. PCFT, a folate transporter, was recently identified at the apical brush border membrane, where it facilitates the intestinal uptake of dietary folates and antifolates (19, 43, 44). Unlike the RFC, the PCFT functions most efficiently under acidic conditions (pH 5.8–6.0) in the intestinal environment. It has been established (44, 45) that the PCFT displays a large differential role in the uptake of several antifolates; an excellent substrate is pemetrexed, other efficient substrates include MTX and raltitrexed whereas PT 523 is a fairly poor substrate. The crucial role of the PCFT in the bioavailability of new-generation antifolates warrants further exploration.

Whereas T cells depend almost exclusively on the RFC for cellular uptake of novel antifolates, it should be mentioned that alternative folate transport routes (46), as well as efflux routes (47), are operative in activated macrophages in RA synovial tissue. These activated macrophages use a folate receptor (FR)-mediated uptake mechanism (46, 48). Given the marked differences in affinities for the RFC and FR, novel antifolates with a good affinity for the RFC are not necessarily effective against FR-expressing activated macrophages. From this perspective GW 1843, displaying a high affinity for both the RFC and FR (and efficient polyglutamylation preventing its cellular efflux), may be an effective drug for targeting both T cells and activated synovial tissue macrophages (19, 46).

In light of one of the proposed mechanisms of action of MTX in RA, that is through AICARTFase inhibition, adenosine release, and adenosine receptor stimulation

Figure 4. Relationship between inhibition of TNF-α production and apoptosis induction in activated T cells from RA patients. T cells in PBMCs from RA patients were stimulated with αCD3/αCD28 for 72 h in the presence of a range of concentrations of MTX and novel antifolates. T-cell activation (CD 25 expression) and induction of apoptosis in CD 25+ cells (right y-axis; Annexin-V/7AAD staining) was determined at the drug concentration that conferred 50% inhibition of TNF-α production (left y-axis; ELISA). The drugs are depicted on the x-axis in order of increasing IC-50 values. The results represent the mean of three separate experiments.

We identified four folate antagonists (PT523, PT644, raltitrexed, and GW1843) with a greater potency (up to 10-fold) than MTX in inhibiting TNF-α production. As the RFC is the dominant folate antagonist transport route in T cells, at least part of the enhanced activity by these novel antifolates over MTX can be attributed to their more efficient cellular uptake by this transporter (19, 36). It is not clear whether T-cell activation would trigger upregulated expression of folate/antifolate transporters. Preliminary studies by Blits et al (37) have shown that the RFC and also proton-coupled folate transporter (PCFT) mRNA expression did not differ significantly in blood cells from healthy controls and DMARD-naive RA patients.

One important parameter for the ex-vivo and in-vivo efficacy of folate antagonists is the extracellular and intracellular folate status because natural folates may compete for cellular uptake and polyglutamylation, respectively (38). The widespread application of folate supplementation to RA patients (39), along with folate food fortification programmes in the past decade, has resulted in markedly higher plasma folate levels in RA patient populations (40), which could confer diminished efficacy of MTX. Apart from MTX, the activity of the TS inhibitor pemetrexed and the lipophilic DHFR inhibitor TMQ were also found to be influenced by alterations in intracellular folate status, while other drugs (e.g. BGC 9331 and GW 1843) retained potent activity regardless of folate status (22, 40, 41). Consistently, such a profile was also observed in Figure 4, revealing that addition of leucovorin rescued activated

(5, 8, 9), it is interesting to note that non-polyglutamatable folate antagonists also display potential anti-inflammatory effects. By definition, non-polyglutamatable DHFR inhibitors such as TMQ, PT523, and PT644 cannot be converted to polyglutamate forms and consequently do not target AICARTFase directly. This suggests that their mechanism of action is probably indirect through dihydrofolate, which accumulates rapidly due to DHFR inhibition (Figure 2), whereby polyglutamate forms of dihydrofolate are potent inhibitors of AICARTFase (1, 19). Consistent with this notion may be the potential anti-inflammatory properties of non-polyglutamatable DHFR inhibitors such as MX-68 in animal models of arthritis (49) and CH-1054 in a controlled clinical trial for RA treatment (50). Of note, at low dosages, the non-polyglutamatable and specific TS inhibitor BGC9331 (30) also exerted potent inhibition of TNF-α production. While this drug does not exert any inhibitory effects on AICARTFase, this finding suggests that, beyond inhibition of AICARTFase, inhibition of other key enzymes in the folate metabolic pathway, such as TS, may also facilitate a potential anti-inflammatory response.

## Conclusions

The present study indicates that new-generation antifolates elicit potential anti-inflammatory effects at low drug concentrations. Even though the clinically accepted good window for MTX efficacy could hold back a timely introduction of these novel folate antagonists, some of their superior pharmacological properties over MTX may be exploited in the future treatment of RA. This option may hold particularly for clinical resistance to MTX or in strategies aimed at improving RA remission. Finally, many of the drugs explored in the current study have been registered for application as anti-cancer drugs with known efficacy and toxicity profiles (19, 25). Hence, their efficacy at low-dose schedules, as for MTX, deserves further exploration in RA treatment.
