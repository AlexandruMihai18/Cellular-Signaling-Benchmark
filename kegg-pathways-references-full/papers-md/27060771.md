**ABSTRACT**

Prion diseases are fatal neurodegenerative disorders that include scrapie of sheep, bovine spongiform encephalopathy of cattle, chronic wasting disease of cervids, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) of humans. The etiology for prion diseases can be infectious, sporadic, or hereditary. However, the common denominator for all types is the formation of a transmissible agent composed of a β-sheet-rich, misfolded version of the host-encoded prion protein (PrP<sup>C</sup>), known as PrP<sup>Sc</sup>. PrP<sup>Sc</sup> self-replicates through a template-assisted process that converts the α-helical conformation of PrP<sup>C</sup> into the disease-associated isoform. In parallel with PrP<sup>Sc</sup> accumulation, spongiform change is pathologically observed in the central nervous system, where “holes” appear because of massive neuronal death. Here, we review the cellular pathways triggered in response to PrP<sup>Sc</sup> formation and accumulation. Available data suggest that neuronal dysfunction and death may be caused by what originates as a cellular pro-survival response to chronic PrP<sup>Sc</sup> accumulation. We also discuss what is known about the complex cross-talk between the endoplasmic reticulum stress components and the quality control pathways. Better knowledge about these processes may lead to innovative therapeutic strategies based on manipulating the stress response and its consequences for neurodegeneration.

**1. Introduction**

Prions are infectious agents responsible for a group of rare, but devastating, neurodegenerative diseases that affect humans and animals. The underlying mechanism for prion formation is the post-translational misfolding of the cellular prion protein (PrP<sup>C</sup>) into PrP<sup>Sc</sup>, where PrP<sup>Sc</sup> continues to propagate during disease by the conformational transfer of its β-sheet-rich structure to PrP<sup>C</sup> ([Prusiner, 1998](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.brainres.2016.04.009)). Recently, prion-like cell-to-cell spreading has been attributed to a number of disease-related proteins ([Soto, 2012](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.brainres.2016.04.009)). Despite many similarities between prion disease and other neurodegenerative disorders associated with the cerebral accumulation of misfolded protein aggregates, prions remain unique because epidemiological data undeniably support its inter-individual transmission under natural conditions. Also, although the mechanism for protein aggregation and the end product appear to be similar, extensive data emerging over the past decade indicates

that the cellular stress response occurring as a result of protein misfolding is not a generic response, but is dependent on the nature of the protein affected and its subcellular localization (i.e. PrP anchored to the cell surface, amyloid beta released extracellularly after the cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein, and the intracellular aggregation of tau or α-synuclein). Formation and accumulation of these protein aggregates produce differential responses in terms of cellular and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress (Hetz and Mollereau, 2014).

The biosynthesis of PrPC is not distinct from other membrane-bound and secreted proteins. First, PRNP is transcribed in the nucleus and the corresponding mRNA is initially translated by the ribosomes until a 22-amino acid signal peptide is reached. This signal directs PrPC to the ER lumen, where the remainder of the 253 amino acid protein (254 in some species) is synthesized (Cohen, 1999; Harris, 2003). In the ER, a single disulfide bond is formed between cysteine residues 179 and 214, while N-linked oligosaccharide chains of the high-mannose type can be added at amino acid residues 181 and/or 197. At the completion of synthesis, PrPC is subjected to cleavage of the amino-terminal signal peptide, and a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor is attached to replace a 22-amino acid carboxy-terminal GPI signal

peptide that is simultaneously removed (Haraguchi et al., 1989; Stahl et al., 1987; Turk et al., 1988). During transit through the Golgi apparatus, the N-linked oligosaccharide chains and the GPI-anchor are modified to yield more complex structures that include the addition of sialic acid residues (Caughey et al., 1989; Stahl et al., 1992). By following the secretory pathway, mature PrPC containing 209 amino acids is brought to the cell surface and generally localizes at lipid rafts that are rich in sphingolipids and cholesterol (Taraboulos et al., 1992a; Vey et al., 1996). Then, PrPC cycles between the cell surface and intracellularly via endosomal vesicles (Peters et al., 2003; Sunyach et al., 2003; Vey et al., 1996).

The signaling cascade for cellular stress begins with increased retention of proteins in the ER (Fig. 1, left panel). Comparable to the systematic responses during other protein misfolding diseases, ER retained proteins are initially sent for degradation by the proteasome, autophagy, and/or lysosomes (Fig. 1, middle panel). When ER stress persists, the balance between protein synthesis and degradation is disrupted. A disturbance in proteostasis is revealed by an alteration in ER-calcium homeostasis, as well as increased levels of chaperones and foldases triggered to correct the ER misfolded proteins (Fig. 1, middle panel). A major objective of the unfolded protein response (UPR) is to reduce protein synthesis

**Fig. 1.** The complex cellular stress pathways triggered by prion formation. The left panel shows that cellular stress can be initiated by the conversion of PrPC into PrPSc or inefficient translocation in the ER forming NtmPrP, CtmPrP, and cyPrP. Once generated, PrPSc continues to propagate, being released from the cell surface, and cycle intracellularly in endosomal vesicles. As depicted, PrP species possessing similarities with infectious PrPSc suggests that PrPSc is also located in the ER and cytosol. The middle panel depicts the cell responding to the continued accumulation of PrPSc by transporting them for degradation by the proteasomes. Eventual exasperation of the proteasomes triggers degradative compensation from the lysosomes and through autophagy. The recently discovered RESET pathway may also degrade PrP by trafficking it to the Golgi, rapidly to the cell surface, and then to the lysosomes. In addition, levels of chaperones and foldases are drastically increased to correct the abundance of misfolded proteins, and ER-calcium (Ca++) becomes depleted. The right panel illustrates the activation of the PERK and IRE1α/XBP-1 pathways of the UPR to reduce protein synthesis and generate transcription factors in attempt to recover balanced proteostasis. Persistence of ER stress ultimately will lead to neuronal dysfunction and death. Structures for PrP were adapted from the National Center for Biotechnology Information Molecular Modeling Database (MMDB ID: 19134).
and regain equilibrium with the degradation systems (Fig. 1, right panel). If equilibrium is not regained, continuous ER stress inevitably leads to cell death. Here, we specifically review the multiple cellular pathways triggered by PrP<sup>Sc</sup> accumulation during prion disease, and how these pathways may present novel therapeutic opportunities for disease intervention.

### 2. ER misfolded PrP

A key realization is that no cellular process is 100% efficient, making it no surprise that an estimated 10% of PrP<sup>C</sup> is naturally misfolded as it transits through the ER ([Ma and Lindquist, 2001](https://doi.org/10.1038/nature00679); [Yedidia et al., 2001](https://doi.org/10.1038/35084000)). It has been proposed that PrP<sup>Sc</sup> accumulation might lead to the increased generation or stabilization of ER misfolded subtypes and indeed be tied to the downstream cellular toxicity associated with prion disease by means of ER stress ([Chakrabarti et al., 2009](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2009.03.036)). Although the rate for protein misfolding in the ER is substantially increased by the presence of some mutations associated to inherited prion diseases ([Gu et al., 2003](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0304227100), [2007](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0700549104); [Jin et al., 2000](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.250583897); [Ma and Lindquist, 2001](https://doi.org/10.1038/nature00679); [Singh et al., 1997](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.94.26.14412); [Stewart et al., 2001](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.251542698); [Zanusso et al., 1999](https://doi.org/10.1006/excr.1999.4757)), it is unclear how this process contributes to the formation of pathological PrP<sup>Sc</sup>. PrP misfolded forms harboring similarities with infectious PrP<sup>Sc</sup> appear to be present at the ER and cytosol ([Béranger et al., 2002](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M111387200); [Grenier et al., 2006](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M511818200); [Kristiansen et al., 2005](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M505286200), [2007](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M611388200); [Ma and Lindquist, 2002](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.252662399); [Rane et al., 2008](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M708748200); [Taraboulos et al., 1990](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.87.19.7624)), in addition to the more usual places of accumulation, such as the endosomal vesicles or the plasma membrane ([Caughey and Raymond, 1991](https://doi.org/10.1016/0168-8278(91)90012-U); [Taraboulos et al., 1991](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.88.19.8600)). Several studies have suggested that ER misfolded PrP forms may indeed have a stimulatory effect on PrP<sup>Sc</sup> formation ([Béranger et al., 2002](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M111387200); [Hetz et al., 2007](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M705834200)), thus supporting the hypothesis that certain ER retained forms may obtain a conformation which is intermediate between PrP<sup>C</sup> and PrP<sup>Sc</sup>.

The non-canonical and aberrant pathways of the minor subpopulations of PrP<sup>C</sup> that fail to be fully translocated into the ER lumen have been studied using *in vitro* models, where genetic or pharmacological manipulation result in inefficiencies in ER trafficking leading to elevated levels of ER misfolded PrP forms in comparison to the natural situation *in vivo* ([Hay et al., 1987a](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.84.19.6805), [1987b](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.84.19.6809)). The major determinants for the translocation efficiency of PrP are its signal sequence and hydrophobic domain ([Hegde et al., 1998](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0092-8674(00)81606-0); [Kim et al., 2001](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M101575200); [Stewart and Harris, 2003](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M305552200)). Three subtypes of misfolded PrP variants resulting from abnormal sorting of the protein have been described (Fig. 1, left panel). The first subtype, termed <sup>Ntm</sup>PrP, results from inefficient translocation of the PrP hydrophobic domain that leaves the amino-terminus inserted in the ER membrane and the carboxy-terminus in the cytosol, hence its name ([Hegde et al., 1998](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0092-8674(00)81606-0); [Kim et al., 2001](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M101575200), [2002](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M111387200); [Kim and Hegde, 2002](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M202847200)). Moreover, <sup>Ntm</sup>PrP generation can also result in a second subtype, named <sup>Ctm</sup>PrP, following translocation of the carboxy-terminus and membrane insertion of the hydrophobic domain. Lastly, if the hydrophobic domain fails to engage the translocon, PrP is completely released into the cytosol generating a cytosolic form, referred to as cyPrP ([Drisaldi et al., 2003](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M305552200); [Hegde et al., 1998](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0092-8674(00)81606-0); [Mironov et al., 2003](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M305552200)). Although these forms can be observed in high quantities under experimental conditions, their presence, quantity, and relevance in natural situations is unknown.

Similar subpopulations of PrP can be observed *in vivo* when the proteasome is inhibited or upon favorable manipulation of the signal sequence and/or the hydrophobic domain ([Drisaldi et al., 2003](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M305552200); [Ma and Lindquist, 2001](https://doi.org/10.1038/nature00679); [Rane et al., 2004](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M405834200), [2008](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M708748200); [Stewart and Harris, 2003](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M305552200); [Yedidia et al., 2001](https://doi.org/10.1038/35084000)). Interestingly, overproduction of cyPrP ([Ma et al., 2002](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M202847200)) or <sup>Ctm</sup>PrP ([Hegde et al., 1998](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0092-8674(00)81606-0), [1999](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M202847200); [Rane et al., 2008](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M708748200); [Stewart et al., 2005](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M505286200)) in transgenic mice causes atypical neurodegeneration, but neither subtype possesses

the transmissible capabilities of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> ([Hegde et al., 1999](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M202847200); [Mironov et al., 2003](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M305552200)). This may help to explain why some mutations in human PRNP that increase the hydrophobicity of the hydrophobic domain or decrease the efficiency of translocation are associated with familial prion diseases ([Hegde et al., 1999](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M202847200); [Heske et al., 2004](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M305552200); [Zanusso et al., 1999](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.96.26.15132)). Nonetheless, the evolutionary conservation of a weak PrP<sup>C</sup> signal sequence brings us to the realization that a certain degree of translocation inefficiency may be beneficial for avoiding excessive PrP<sup>C</sup> misfolding under conditions of ER stress such as those presented during prion disease ([Kang et al., 2006](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M505286200); [Kim et al., 2001](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M101575200), [2002](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M111387200)).

### 3. Proteasomes, lysosomes, and autophagy

The primary quality control system linked to protein misfolding in the ER is the ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD) ubiquitin-proteasome system (Fig. 1, middle panel). Interestingly, both PrP<sup>C</sup> and PrP<sup>Sc</sup> have been observed to accumulate following inhibition of the proteasome in cultured cells, thus indicating that this system plays a more general role than purely a disease-specific function in maintaining proteostasis ([Ma and Lindquist, 2001](https://doi.org/10.1038/nature00679); [Yedidia et al., 2001](https://doi.org/10.1038/35084000)). The most compelling observations connecting a dysfunctional ERAD ubiquitin-proteasome system to prion disease include the accumulation of ubiquitinated PrP and the presence of other key proteasomal substrates in the brains of prion-infected mice ([Kang et al., 2004](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M305552200); [Kristiansen et al., 2007](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M611388200)), as well as the ability of the ubiquitin ligase encoding Hectd2 gene to affect prion disease incubation times ([Lloyd et al., 2009](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M705834200)). This proteasomal response is believed to root from a direct interaction between PrP<sup>Sc</sup> and the 26S proteasome, which results in the inhibition of the catalytic core β-subunits by decreasing gate opening and substrate entry into the 20S particle ([Deriziotis et al., 2011](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M705834200); [Kristiansen et al., 2007](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M611388200)). In support of this concept, the degree of proteasomal dysfunction over the course of prion disease *in vivo* strongly correlated with the amount of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> deposition ([McKinnon et al., 2016](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M705834200)). Recently, treatment with a small molecule to enhance proteasome activity *in vitro* was shown to successfully reduce the PrP<sup>Sc</sup> load, but this strategy is yet to be tested *in vivo* ([McKinnon et al., 2016](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M705834200)).

When proteasome degradation becomes retarded, the primary alternative route for cellular protein clearance is autophagy via lysosomes, which has the ability to target aggregated proteins for bulk degradation (Fig. 1, middle panel). A physiological role of autophagy in the degradation of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> was suggested by the enhanced clearance of cellular PrP<sup>Sc</sup> during induction of autophagy and the elevated accumulation of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> during inhibition of autophagy ([Aguib et al., 2009](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M705834200); [Ertmer et al., 2004](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M705834200), [2007](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M705834200); [Heiseke et al., 2010](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M705834200)). This data is also supported by the longstanding view that PrP<sup>Sc</sup> commonly undergoes lysosomal trimming of its amino-terminus ([Caughey et al., 1991](https://doi.org/10.1016/0168-8278(91)90012-U); [Taraboulos et al., 1992b](https://doi.org/10.1016/0168-8278(91)90012-U)). Evidence for a role of autophagy *in vivo* includes the presence of multi-vesicular bodies and vacuoles commonly associated with autophagy in prion-infected brains ([Boellaard et al., 1989](https://doi.org/10.1016/0168-8278(91)90012-U); [Dron et al., 2005](https://doi.org/10.1016/0168-8278(91)90012-U); [Liberski et al., 1992](https://doi.org/10.1016/0168-8278(91)90012-U), [2008](https://doi.org/10.1016/0168-8278(91)90012-U); [Liberski and Mori, 1997](https://doi.org/10.1016/0168-8278(91)90012-U); [Sikorska et al., 2004](https://doi.org/10.1016/0168-8278(91)90012-U)), which are recapitulated in a unique prion-infected cell culture model that exhibits many characteristics of neurodegeneration ([Schatzl et al., 1997](https://doi.org/10.1016/0168-8278(91)90012-U)). Additional *in vivo* studies report that the autophagy marker LC3 is altered in *Prnp*<sup>-/-</sup> mice ([Oh et al., 2008](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M705834200)) and scrapie infected hamsters ([Xu et al., 2012](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M705834200)).

Certain ER misfolded PrP subtypes have also been shown to traffic to the Golgi and indirectly travel to lysosomes very rapidly following a brief transit through the plasma membrane ([Ashok and Hegde, 2009](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M705834200); [Satpute-Krishnan et al., 2014](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M705834200)) (Fig. 1, middle panel). This ER-clearance process was named RESET (for rapid ER stress-induced export) and suggests that the ER-clearance
pathways that involve the ERAD proteasome system or autophagy are not always the default degradation routes during ER stress. Importantly, RESET was characterized *in vitro* utilizing both genetic disease-causing PrP mutants in the carboxy-terminus, as well as a more artificial PrP model created by disrupting its disulfide bond and utilizing a stronger signal sequence. Retention of these particular misfolded PrP subtypes in the ER primarily relied on an interaction with calnexin, while export from the ER was dependent on Tmp21 (Satpute-Krishnan et al., 2014). Furthermore, the RESET pathway could potentially be related to the delayed post-Golgi vesicular trafficking and the reduced cell surface expression of PrP<sup>C</sup> recently described in prion disease models *in vitro* and *in vivo* (Uchiyama et al., 2013).

### 4. Calcium homeostasis

ER stress leads to the disruption of ER-calcium homeostasis early-on (*Fig.* 1, middle panel). In fact, ER calcium release to the cytoplasm was an initial observation *in vitro* for cells exposed to nanomolar concentrations of purified PrP<sup>Sc</sup> from prion-infected mouse brains (Hetz et al., 2003), as well as those overexpressing a transmembrane PrP form or hereditary PrP mutants associated with human prion diseases (Torres et al., 2010). Calcium depletion likely occurs because exposure to PrP<sup>Sc</sup> increases the sensitivity of the cells to cell death by directly affecting calcium influx and efflux mediated through the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA) pumps, the ryanodine receptor (RYR) calcium channels, and the inositol trisphosphate receptor (IP3Rs) calcium channels (Hetz et al., 2003; Torres et al., 2010). Once calcium is depleted in the ER, the percentage of newly synthesized proteins improperly folding and accumulating in the ER lumen increases, mostly because many ER chaperones and foldases require calcium to maintain optimal activity (Hetz and Mollereau, 2014). However, the upstream components of this signaling pathway are yet to be discovered so no obvious therapeutic targets exist.

A direct consequence of ER calcium depletion is elevated levels of cytosolic calcium. This leads to hyperactivation of the key brain phosphatase calcineurin (CaN) (Mukherjee et al., 2010) (*Fig.* 1, middle panel). Hyperactivation of CaN is critical because it controls important signaling events modulating neuronal fate and functioning (Mansuy, 2003). Interestingly, FK506 treatment successfully reversed the hyperactivation of CaN in cultured cells chronically propagating adapted scrapie prions and mice challenged with scrapie. In fact, FK506 treatment of symptomatic animals reduced their clinical signs, significantly increased their lifespan, and decreased brain degeneration (Mukherjee et al., 2010). The mechanism for successful intervention with FK506 has been proposed to be a result of inhibiting CaN activity, inducing autophagy, and/or reducing PrP<sup>C</sup> expression by compromising its translocation (Mukherjee et al., 2010; Stocki et al., 2016). Gaining further knowledge about FK506 is of essence, since it is one of only a few FDA approved drugs possessing potential therapeutic value for treating prion disease.

### 5. Chaperones and foldases

Molecular chaperones and folding enzymes are mostly located in the cytoplasm and the ER, where they mediate proper protein folding, prevent protein aggregation, direct the degradation of misfolded proteins, and are typically upregulated as the first signs of ER stress (Sitia and Braakman, 2003). Collectively, these chaperones can be subdivided into glucose-regulated proteins (GRPs), protein disulfide isomerases (PDI), and heat-shock proteins (HSPs)

involvement of Hsp70 and other HSPs in a more relevant model for prion disease is an interesting prospect.

6. Unfolded protein response

Continuous accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER alters homeostasis, triggering a stress response termed the UPR (Fig. 1, right panel). The UPR begins as a pro-survival process aimed to restore equilibrium between protein synthesis and degradation, but persistent stress eventually leads to the induction of apoptosis (Hetz and Soto, 2006; Schröder and Kaufman, 2005). Three mechanistically distinct branches have been described in the UPR. Each branch begins with a specialized stress sensor located at the ER membrane: IRE1 (inositol requiring enzyme 1), PERK (double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase (PKR)-like ER kinase), and ATF6 (activating transcription factor 6) (Walter and Ron, 2011). Activation of the first and most conserved branch relies on the dimerization of IRE1 and its autophosphorylation to initiate a signaling cascade mediated through the potent transcription factor X-box binding protein 1 (XBP-1) to upregulate a subset of UPR-related genes involved in protein folding and ERAD (Hetz and Mollereau, 2014). The second branch of the UPR is facilitated by the oligomerization of PERK that phosphorylates itself and the translation initiation factor eIF2α, in turn inactivating eIF2 and inhibiting mRNA translation. The third UPR pathway is initiated by ATF6 following cleavage in the Golgi, which increases the expression of grp78 and xbp-1 transcription (Hetz et al., 2007). To date, only the IRE1 and PERK pathways (Fig. 1, right panel), but not the ATF6 pathway, have been intensely investigated under a prion disease setting.

The IRE1α/XBP-1 pathway is highly conserved among eukaryotes. Under chemically induced conditions *in vitro*, expression of a dominant negative form of IRE1α or XBP-1 significantly increased PrP aggregation, while overexpression of an active mutant form of XBP-1 decreased accumulation of misfolded PrP aggregates (Hetz et al., 2007; Orsi et al., 2006). Concomitantly, prion infection in wild type mice led to XBP-1 mRNA splicing and the IREα mediated activation of stress kinases JNK and ERK (Hetz et al., 2006, 2008; Nguyên et al., 2004; Steele et al., 2007; Urano et al., 2000). To better examine the role of this pathway during prion disease *in vivo*, a central nervous system-specific XBP-1 conditional knockout mouse was created. However, prion infection of XBP-1 knockout mice did not show differences with wild type mice at the levels of prion replication, neuronal loss, upregulation of apoptosis markers, or incubation period (Hetz et al., 2008). These results suggest that the involvement of the UPR in prion disease is complex and possibly some compensatory pathways exist to deal with damage when one of the pathways is blocked. One may hypothesize that activation of other UPR pathways may compensate for XBP-1 deficiency, but there was no evidence that this occurred by end-stage prion disease in XBP-1 knockout mice.

The purpose of the PERK pathway is to reduce the amount of proteins entering the ER to alleviate ER stress (Walter and Ron, 2011). The PERK pathway was reported to be activated in the hippocampi of prion-infected wild type mice and those over-expressing PrPC (Moreno et al., 2012). Interestingly, this may be a hippocampal specific response because others have observed only weak to no activation of this pathway following whole brain analysis in different end-stage murine models for prion disease (Hetz et al., 2008; Mays et al., 2014; Unterberger et al., 2006). As PrPSc levels rise in PrPC over-expressing mice infected with prions, there is global translational repression of protein synthesis via phosphorylation of the eIF2α (eIF2α-P) translational initiation factor. The general decline in protein levels during infection, in particularly for several synaptic proteins, was proposed to be a key trigger for prion neurodegeneration (Moreno et al., 2012). Importantly, the authors specified PrPC as “exempt” from the eIF2α-P-mediated translational repression because its mRNA contains multiple start codons upstream of the main open reading frame. However, this is only true for the human PrP mRNA sequence deposited in the National Center for Biotechnology Information database and not that of rodents. Moreover, PRNP does not fit the canonical arrangement of other known genes (i.e. ATF4) with defined upstream open reading frames (Jackson et al., 2010; Spriggs et al., 2010). However, since the PERK pathway can reduce protein levels without altering mRNA levels, ER stress induced translational repression of PRNP remains a potential mechanism for the pre-clinical reduction in PrPC levels observed during several different prion diseases (Mays et al., 2014, 2015).

Despite these contradictions, there has been considerable progress in blocking different components of the PERK pathway to regain efficient translation, return protein expression to basal levels, and delay the onset of prion disease. Two pharmacological PERK inhibitors, GSK2606414 (Moreno et al., 2013) and ISRIB (Halliday et al., 2015), were found to confer neuroprotection and delay clinical disease by the complete or partial restoration of protein synthesis, respectively. Although ISRIB did not cause the severe pancreatic toxicity observed for GSK2606414, both treatment groups were prematurely sacrificed because of weight loss unrelated to prion disease, thus making their exact effectiveness inconclusive. Moving one step downstream in the PERK pathway, eIF2α-P dephosphorylation was chemically inhibited with salubrinal or induced by focal overexpression of GADD34; both significantly altered survival with the length of incubation being inversely proportional to the amount of eIF2α-P (Moreno et al., 2012). Collectively, these studies highlight two critical points: 1) PERK/eIF2α activation occurs downstream from PrPSc replication in prion-diseased mice and 2) reversing the translational repression of synaptic proteins is a valid therapeutic strategy for prion disease.

7. Apoptosis

An increased load of misfolded proteins and prolonged ER stress leads to a switch from UPR adaptive responses to pro-apoptotic programs that are mediated by caspase-12, which executes apoptosis by inducing caspase-3 activity (Mehmet, 2000). Several of the aforementioned pathways result in apoptosis via activation of the caspase cascade including altered calcium homeostasis, the IRE1α pathway, and the PERK pathway. Altered calcium homeostasis due to IP3R or RYR activation can contribute to apoptosis because calcium release activates caspase-12 (Hetz et al., 2003; Torres et al., 2010). The IRE1α pathway is known to contribute to apoptosis by the downstream activation of the JNK pathway that in-turn activates the caspase cascade. Furthermore, a downstream component of the IRE1α pathway, called RIDD, can also induce cell death by degrading mRNA that encodes essential ER chaperones and by the downregulation of microRNAs that negatively regulate the expression of pro-apoptotic caspases. Additionally, the PERK pathway triggers apoptosis by multiple ways through downstream ATF4 and CHOP signaling. ATF4 and CHOP can cause ATP depletion by increasing protein synthesis within stressed cells, thus inducing apoptosis by “poisoning” the cells. Through a more direct path, ATF4 and CHOP can also inhibit Bcl-2 and engage pro-apoptotic proteins to activate the caspase cascade, as well as Bax- and Bak-dependent apoptosis at the mitochondria (Han et al., 2013).

The exact apoptotic mechanism taking place during prion disease is yet to be determined. In vitro, an immortalized neuronal cell line exhibited an enhanced rate of pro-caspase 12 processing

when chronically infected with prions, as well as progressive caspase-3 activation and apoptosis upon treatment with brain-derived PrP<sup>Sc</sup> (Hetz et al., 2003; Torres et al., 2010). Sensitivity to PrP<sup>Sc</sup> treatment was reduced by targeting the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 to the ER membrane, by expressing a dominant negative form of caspase-12, or by treatment with a caspase-3 inhibitor. When treated with ER stress inducers, these chronically prion-infected cells became more sensitive to ER-stress mediated cell death than non-infected cells. In parallel, apoptotic neuronal cell death has been observed to occur in late stage prion diseases of humans and animals, as indicated by caspase 12 activation and small alterations to other genes associated with apoptosis (Hetz et al., 2003; Lyahyai et al., 2006; Park et al., 2000). Interestingly, challenging genetically modified mice null for caspase 12, null for pro-apoptotic Bax, or overexpressing anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 failed to have a drastic effect on disease progression or prion replication (Chiesa et al., 2005; Couplier et al., 2006; Steele et al., 2007). Therefore, results from these animal models indicate that the primary route for cell death could either involve a non-apoptotic pathway or a non-apoptotic pathway can efficiently compensate for the loss of the classical apoptotic pathway composed of the caspase cascade and Bax. Alternatively, it is possible that apoptosis is a late stage process in prion disease that may not be very important for the initiation and progression of the disease. Indeed, it has been suggested that prion disease symptoms are rather determined by synaptic dysfunction and massive neuronal death occurring late in the disease (Moreno et al., 2012).

### 8. Concluding remarks

Over the past decade, abundant knowledge has accumulated with regard to the specific stress pathways triggered as a response to PrP<sup>Sc</sup> accumulation during prion infection. However, the sequence of events is unclear due to the complexity of the cross-talk between the ER stress signaling pathways and their unlikelihood of operating linearly. Furthermore, the degree of contribution that ER misfolded PrP forms play in disease progression remains uncertain and it is disputable whether they are the origin of certain familial and/or sporadic prion disease cases. Despite these hurdles, substantial progress has been made demonstrating that potential therapeutic targets exist within these pathways. Moreover, continued research in this area have suggested explanations for certain evasive prion disease-specific phenomena such as the endoproteolytic transition for PrP (Chen et al., 1995), as well as the progressive pre-clincial reduction in PrP<sup>C</sup> (Mays et al., 2014, 2015) and PrP-like shadoo protein levels (Watts et al., 2011; Westaway et al., 2011). The existing data indicates that neuronal cells fail to recover homeostasis following PrP<sup>Sc</sup> insult, which unavoidably leads to cell damage and a type of cell death that may or may not involve apoptosis. Ultimately, the degree of therapeutic intervention relies on whether these pathways can be safely modulated so that the cells remain both functional and viable.
