**FINE SPECIFICITY OF THE AUTOIMMUNE RESPONSE TO THE Ro/SSA AND La/SSB RIBONUCLEOPROTEINS**

R. HAL SCOFIELD, A. DARISE FARRIS, ANGELA C. HORSFALL, and JOHN B. HARLEY

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic inflammatory illness characterized by circulating antibodies to self. The disease is clinically diverse, as epitomized by the classification criteria (1) as well as by the wide array of autoantibody specificities found in the sera of patients (2). Sjögren’s syndrome (SS) is clinically less diverse than SLE and is usually characterized by inflammation of the salivary glands. Nevertheless, this disease is also associated with systemic autoimmunity, frequently in the form of antinuclear antibodies (ANA). Over the past several decades, the individual self proteins targeted by ANA have been elucidated and characterized. One such autoantigen that is the target of autoimmunity in both SLE and SS is the Ro (or, SSA) antigen. In addition, 48-kd La (or, SSB) is frequently an autoantigen in patients with SLE or SS (3).

Anti-Ro is found in the sera of up to 50% of SLE patients and a higher percentage of patients with SS (for review, see ref. 3). Originally identified by double immunodiffusion in the sera of SLE patients with no ANA (4), and later identified as SS-A in the sera of SS patients (5), anti-Ro is associated with several clinical aspects of the disease (6) as well as with alleles of HLA and T cell receptor genes (7–12). All sera with a Ro precipitin have antibodies against 60-kd Ro (13,14), which is associated with one of several hY RNA, which are short and uridine rich (15). Antibodies to a 52-kd protein (anti-52-kd Ro) are found in some sera with anti-60-kd Ro (16). The physical relationship of this protein to the Ro RNP particle (60-kd Ro plus hY RNA) remains a subject of controversy (16–20).

Similar to anti-52-kd Ro, anti-La antibodies are found largely in sera that also contain anti-60-kd Ro. The 48-kd La antigen (21) is, in part, physically associated with the Ro RNP particle (22,23). La serves as a termination factor for RNA polymerase III (23,24) and has other biologic functions (25). The function of neither 60-kd Ro nor 52-kd Ro is completely known, although 60-kd Ro may be involved in the ribosomal RNA discard pathway (26,27).

Over the last decade, we and others have studied these autoantigens—60-kd Ro, 52-kd Ro, and 48-kd La—with regard to the fine specificity of antibody binding. In this article, we review and summarize the reports that have examined the fine specificity of antibody binding to the Ro and La autoantigens.

### The 60-kd Ro (or, SSA) antigen

We studied antibody binding to short peptides (octapeptides overlapping by 7 residues) and found as many as 20 distinct primary epitopes (Figure 1). The pattern of reactivity among patients was quite variable, with some patients’ sera binding all 20 epitopes and others binding only a few (28,29). These epitopes were related in sequence to a nucleocapsid protein of vesicular stomatitis virus (28,29). Anti-Ro-positive SLE patients tend to have antibody binding this nucleocapsid protein compared with binding by anti-Ro-negative

patients (30), and immunization of rabbits with this viral protein induced anti-Ro (31). Other work with short peptides has shown that antibodies binding a carboxyl-terminal epitope defined by amino acids EYRKKMDI (28) at residues 485–492 are a minority of the total anti-60-kd Ro (32). These data are consistent with those of previous studies (28,29).

The antigenicity of 60-kd Ro is dependent on the tertiary structure of the molecule, such that antibody binding is largely lost with denaturation of the protein (33). Nevertheless, sera that did not bind the denatured whole molecule, on immunoblots for example, did bind the overlapping octapeptides (28,29). To clarify this apparent contradiction, antibody that bound to the native molecule or single epitopes was affinity purified. The results suggested that antibodies that bind to peptides are, in fact, part of the population of antibodies that bind the native particle (34,35). Other data using multiple antigenic peptides have demonstrated that the identified epitopes are the components of 60-kd Ro tertiary epitopes (35). Thus, the overlapping octapeptide technique has identified primary sequences of the 60-kd Ro molecule that make up conformational epitopes.

Routsias and colleagues (36,37) synthesized 22 amino acid peptides, overlapping by 5, and studied their immunoreactivity with 4 anti-60-kd Ro sera from SLE patients and 4 anti-Ro/La sera from primary SS patients. Those investigators found an epitope spanning 60-kd Ro residues 169–190 in SLE sera and one spanning 211–232 in primary SS sera. The minimal epitope of the former is 175–184 and of the latter 216–232, although each patient serum had an individual pattern of reactivity with shorter peptides (36). In a larger study of 31 SLE anti-Ro sera and 31 SS sera, the disease associations were not nearly as striking (37). This second study used alanine substitution peptides to determine the residues

critical for antibody binding (37). At least 4 amino acids could not be substituted in the SLE epitope and 7 in the SS epitope (Figure 1). Also tested for immunoreactivity with anti-60-kd Ro sera were peptides from HLA-DR that share sequence with the SLE epitope. Peptides from both HLA-DR1 and DR3 were bound by these sera (37). The epitopes found by Routsias et al and the distinct pattern of reactivity among different sera are consistent with data from other investigators. However, the lack of epitopes in other parts of the molecule is not (Figure 1).

The difference may be related to techniques such as the length of the peptide. In addition, Routsias et al required that anti-60-kd Ro sera were positive in counter-immunoelectrophoresis, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and tissue extract immunoblot (36, 37). A large body of data demonstrates that many, if not most, anti-60-kd Ro sera do not bind in immunoblot after sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) of a tissue extract (refs. 28, 29, 34, and 38–40, and see below). Thus, this requirement for Routsias’ studies has likely selected an immunologic subset of anti-60-kd Ro sera.

Other studies have used large peptide fragments of 60-kd Ro (29, 37, 38, 41, 42). Antibodies binding a 13-kd carboxyl-terminal V8 protease fragment of 60-kd Ro were associated with concurrent anti-La (38). In a study of recombinant fragments, Wahren and colleagues (41) found that sera from all of 42 anti-Ro-positive patients bound a fragment spanning amino acids 181–396. Several different patterns of reactivity were found among the 42 sera that were reactive against 60-kd Ro oligopeptides (20 amino acids in length, overlapping by 5) (see Figure 1). Another study using recombinant 60-kd Ro and fragments thereof found that a number of sera that were positive by immunodiffusion failed to react with full-length recombinant protein (39). This is similar to results from another study using recombinant fusion protein (40) and indicates how critical the native structure is for some anti-Ro sera.

In another study, McCauliffe et al (39) performed ELISAs using 60-kd Ro recombinant fragments and sera from patients with subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (SCLE), SLE, and from mothers of infants with neonatal lupus erythematosus (NLE) (Figure 1). All fragments were bound by some sera from patients in each category (39). The 13-kd carboxyl-terminal fragment described above (28, 38) spanned residues 419–538. Thus, this fragment and the 410–538 fragment used by McCauliffe et al (39) were nearly equivalent. Twenty-eight of 67 sera (42%) bound the amino acid residues 419–538 V8 protease fragment (27, 35), and 16 of 40

(40%) bound the residues 410–538 recombinant fragment (39).

Saitta and colleagues (42) generated 10 overlapping recombinant 60-kd Ro peptides and tested them for immunoreactivity using soluble immunoprecipitation. From 12 sera, 7 patterns of reactivity and a minimum of 7 distinct epitopes were found (Figure 1). Thus, similar to previous work, that study found a great diversity in the fine specificity of the antibody response.

Several studies have directly assessed the nature of the antibody response to 60-kd Ro with regard to native versus denatured antigen. Using solid-phase assays of recombinant clones, a variable but significant percentage of anti-Ro sera fail to react (33, 38–41, 43, 44). When analyzed by soluble immunoprecipitation instead of solid-phase assays, these same sera bound full-length recombinant 60-kd Ro protein (43). Using a variety of techniques, including Western immunoblot and a sandwich ELISA specific for native antigen, Itoh and Reichlin have shown that all anti-Ro precipitin-positive sera react with 60-kd Ro. However, 10 of 43 (23%) bind only native antigen (44). In related work, those authors have also found that some antibodies to native 60-kd Ro bind denatured 52-kd Ro (45).

Other investigators have not found a cross-reaction using inhibition studies (43), but the cross-reacting species of antibody may be too small a component of the response to either antigen to be detected in this manner. Other data support a cross-reaction. Antibody purified from a peptide of 52-kd Ro (amino acids 197–207) within the leucine zipper region bound not only native 60-kd Ro but also multiple short peptides from 60-kd Ro (Chambers JC, Barber B, Kurien BT, Scofield RH: manuscript in preparation). These data again suggest that sequences comprising tertiary epitopes can be identified, in this case, one that is cross-reactive with a leucine zipper-region epitope of 52-kd Ro.

Another study has found a distinct difference in the epitopes bound by sera from patients with SLE versus sera from patients with primary SS (46). Using 5 synthetic peptides spanning a small portion of the 60-kd Ro molecule (see Figure 1), Barakat et al found that almost 50% of SS patients had antibodies that bound a peptide with residues 21–41. Less than 5% of sera from SLE patients bound this same peptide. This region was not found to be antigenic in other studies of SLE patient sera (28, 34–36).

The 52-kd Ro (or, SSA) antigen

Anti-52-kd Ro was first identified on immunoblots, and its recognition is still largely dependent on this

technique (47). Thus, antibody interaction with 52-kd Ro is not as dependent on tertiary structure as that of 60-kd Ro. The epitopes of 52-kd Ro have been evaluated by several means. Of the 3 studies (48–50) examining deletion mutants by the in vitro translation and immunoprecipitation method, all identified a commonly bound epitope overlapping the leucine zipper motif (the motif spans amino acid residues 183–232). Essential regions of this epitope were mapped to residues 216–292 (49), 169–291 (48), and 196–292 (50) in the vast majority of sera tested. Buyon and colleagues (48) also identified a conformationally dependent N-terminal epitope within residues 1–78, recognized by 50% of a large heterogeneous cohort of sera positive for antibodies to 52-kd Ro. Two other groups (49,50) also mapped epitopes overlapping this N-terminal, one identified by Buyon et al (See Figure 2). Other epitopes have been identified in studies of deletion mutants (Figure 2), including data that sera recognizing the same epitope have different fine specificities (50).

These data suggest that recognition of 52-kd Ro B cell epitopes may be more heterogeneous than revealed in typical deletion mutant mapping studies. Where assessed, these studies found no antigenicity in

the carboxyl-terminal half of 52-kd Ro. Buyon et al (48) did, however, map a “sticky” region to residues 440–475, which bound antibodies nonspecifically.

Though the epitopes identified in these studies overlapped the leucine zipper region, the data were not clear whether antibodies actually bound the motif. Chan and colleagues (51) demonstrated that 87% of sera from mothers of infants with congenital complete heart block (CCHB) immunoprecipitated the β form of 52-kd Ro (lacking residues 168–245). This would seemingly suggest that essential features of the leucine zipper epitope must be located to the C-terminal side of the 52β deletion. However, recombinant fusion protein mapping studies (see below) tend to support the presence of a neoepitope in the 52β isoform (51).

All 5 epitope-mapping studies using various bacterial recombinant fusion proteins and their deletion mutants also have mapped an epitope overlapping the leucine zipper motif. This was the only epitope within the fragment containing amino acids 135–232, as determined by Frank and colleagues (52). This epitope was bound by 100% of sera and was critically dependent on amino acid residues 197–207, as demonstrated in blocking studies (52). Similarly, Blange et al (53) showed that

100% of anti-52-kd Ro sera tested recognized the fragment 136–292, with 90% recognizing amino acid residues 136–227. Of interest, when the 136–227 fragment was split into amino acids 136–196 and 197–227, binding to these peptides was found in only 20% of sera (51). Thus, this work pinpoints the same critical region described by Frank et al (52). However, in contrast to Frank et al, Blange and colleagues also mapped an N-terminal epitope (53).

Only one other study mapping epitopes with recombinant proteins detected an N-terminal epitope apart from the leucine zipper epitope (39). In those experiments, 2 broad regions, specifically, amino acid residues 1–178 and 138–340, were demonstrated to be independently recognized by sera from patients with primary SS, NLE, or SCLE (39). A C-terminal fragment encompassing amino acids 335–475 was bound by 6–8% of sera from primary SS or SCLE patients, but not by NLE patient or control sera (39). This binding might be due to the nonspecific “sticky” region reported by Buyon et al (48), or it might correlate with a linear epitope described by Ricchiuti et al (54).

Two groups of investigators have mapped the B cell epitopes of 52-kd Ro using the same set of bacterial fusion protein deletion mutants. In the first study, Kato et al (55) mapped an antigenic region within residues 197–245, but demonstrated several nonlinear determinants within this area. Although the region 197–245 was shown to be the only critically important region by deletion mapping studies, the 197–245 fragment was far less antigenic than the fragment containing amino acids 1–245. However, Buyon et al (48) did show that the essential major epitope in their study (residues 169–291) bound antibodies eluted from 52-kd Ro on Western immunoblots. Of considerable interest, the greatest diminution of reactivity noted with C-terminal deletions spanning residues 197–245 occurred between amino acids 198–203, closely coinciding with critical regions noted in the studies by Frank et al (52) and Blange et al (53). Dörner and colleagues (56), using proteins from the constructs described by Kato et al (55), found an antigenic region lying between residues 153–245, with a strong essential component encompassed within amino acids 197–245.

Finally, a single study has examined a panel of 39 overlapping peptides spanning the 52-kd Ro sequence. Four nonoverlapping peptides, shown to be accessible on the native protein, reacted with SS and SLE antisera (54) (Figure 2). No peptides derived from the leucine zipper were reactive. However, those investigators used peptides that were 15 amino acids in length and that overlapped adjacent peptides by only 3 amino acids.

Thus, many possible short peptides are not evaluated by this technique. Reactivity toward amino acids 2–11 is in direct contrast to results obtained by Buyon et al (48), in whose study no sera tested reacted to a peptide composed of amino acid residues 1–15. It is unclear whether the latter group ensured that the peptide adequately coated the microtiter plate wells in the ELISA, whereas this was controlled for in the study by Ricchiuti and colleagues (54).

In the study reported by Ricchiuti et al (54), the immunoreactive peptide 365–382 was located in a region found to be completely nonantigenic in all but one other study (39). It may be that the C-terminal fragments tested in other studies failed to assume conformations that mimic the display of this peptide on the surface of the native molecule, since Ricchiuti and coworkers demonstrated an inhibition of antisera binding to native 52-kd Ro protein with the 365–382 peptide in the solution phase. The lack of antigenicity of peptides covering the N-terminal zinc finger domains is consistent with the presence of a conformational epitope in this region. This is suggested by its lack of detection in the majority of bacterial fusion protein deletion mutants, which may not mimic native conformation, and was directly demonstrated by Buyon et al, who found that pretreatment of the fragment with β-mercaptoethanol or SDS abolished the immunoprecipitation (48).

Various correlations between epitope recognition and disease subsets or other parameters were noted in the above studies. These results are summarized in Table 1. In general, sera from patients with SS tended to bind more epitopes than sera from patients with SLE. However, several studies found no difference (see Table 1). Buyon et al (48) found that type II sera (defined as recognizing both the central epitope and the conformationally dependent N-terminal epitope), as opposed to type I sera (defined as recognizing only the central epitope), tended to have higher titers of antibodies to 60-kd Ro antibodies, but did not have higher titers of anti-52-kd Ro antibodies. The type II pattern of antibody binding was also significantly associated with the haplotype HLA-DRB1*0301;DQA1*0501;DQB1*0201 (46). Other work has shown that DQB1*0201 is associated with higher anti-60-kd Ro antibody titers (9).

The 48-kd La (or, SSB) antigen

Early efforts to identify epitopes on the La antigen began by using enzymatic digestion of the native protein. V8 protease digestion generated 2 fragments, both of which are antigenic: X (N-terminal portion), which is methionine rich, and Y (C-terminal portion),

which is phosphorylated (57). The RNA binding site is located within fragment X (58). Subsequently, the C-terminal 355-amino acid polypeptide of La (59), expressed from a 1.4-kb La clone (21), was recognized by all anti-La positive sera as well as by the monoclonal anti-La antibody SW5 (60). Three subclones were studied, LaI (bases 1–251), LaII (bases 252–755), and LaIII (bases 756 to the 3′ terminus). Subclone LaIII was strongly immunoreactive with anti-La sera, confirming

an epitope within the 103 amino acids from the predicted C-terminal end of the La protein (Figure 3). Absorption experiments with the 355-amino acid recombinant polypeptide and the subclones showed at least 1 other epitope that may be conformationally dependent. These data were subsequently confirmed and extended by another group of investigators, who isolated human complementary DNA (cDNA) that encoded <70% of the La protein, including the C-terminus. La

In addition, line thickness indicates the magnitude of response (i.e., major, intermediate, or minor epitope defined by the percentage of reactive sera); broken line indicates that no epitope was found; parentheses indicate that no fusion protein could be expressed from cDNA subclones; boldface numbers and letters indicate cDNA fragments; * indicates cross-reactive epitopes, despite lack of linear sequence similarity.

cDNA fragments were used to express a total of 9 smaller and overlapping protein sequences. Immunoblotting with 15 SS patient sera demonstrated at least 3 distinct, immunologically nonrelated, continuous epitopes (Figure 3). By ELISA, the majority of sera showed the strongest reactivity with region C (residues 234–268) and the lowest with region A (residues 112–180) (61).

Chambers et al (62) published the sequence of full-length human La cDNA and expressed 4 recombinant subfragments (Figure 3). Immunodot-blot with 6 sera and a larger ELISA study (63) using 20 anti-La sera from 19 connective tissue disease patients showed that antibody binding was greatest at the middle portion of the molecule, La C (111–242), intermediate with La A (1–102), and lowest with La D (242–408) (61). The same subclones were later used to show that 1) levels of antibodies to the different regions of the La protein varied in parallel during the course of the disease and 2) the antibodies represented independent populations, implicating an antigen-driven response (64).

The fine specificity of antibodies reacting with La C was further examined using 6 synthetic peptides (122–136, 133–147, 166–180, 188–202, 210–224, and 221–235). Sera from 22 SS patients with anti-La antibodies showed little or no binding to any of the 6 synthetic peptides. In contrast 6 of 22 sera from aged autoimmune MRL-lpr/lpr mice, which showed significant binding to full-length recombinant La, also bound peptides 122–136 and 210–224. This binding correlated with levels of binding to La C (residues 111–242). Such spontaneously arising anti-La antibodies showed different patterns of La antigen recognition from those arising by immunization of MRL-+/+ mice with recombinant La (65). Anti-La antibodies spontaneously produced in autoimmune mouse strains display a pattern of fine specificity for linear or continuous determinants that is distinct from human autoantibodies (66).

Another group of investigators used the full-length La clone described above (59) to generate 13 overlapping fragments. These constructs were then probed by immunoblotting and ELISA using anti-La-positive sera from 30 patients (67). Two major epitopes were identified—one in the N-terminal half and the other in the C-terminal half of the molecule. These probably corresponded to the X and Y fragments generated by protease digestion. Within these regions, smaller epitopes could be identified, but usually with lower reactivity. Some epitopes were defined as conformational since their antigenicity was destroyed by heat denaturation, and subclones within the region were negative. The more N-terminal epitopes were recognized predominantly by antibodies using κ light chains, while those toward the C-terminal were recognized either by antibodies with a λ light chain predominance or a normal κ:λ ratio, which suggests distinct populations of antibodies. Isoelectric focusing of antibodies eluted from each fragment indicated that the κ light chain antibodies were oligoclonal, while the heavy chains were almost exclusively of the IgG1 subclass, as previously reported (68,69). The striking restriction in the spectrotypes of antibodies to the 2 epitopes strongly suggests that there is a pauciclonal expansion of anti-La-reactive B cells.

We studied antibody binding to octapeptides (overlapping by 7 amino acids) of the 48-kd La molecule using the technique applied to 60-kd Ro (28,29). Sera from 5 healthy donors and from 10 patients with SLE and/or SS (2 with anti-Ro alone and 8 with both anti-Ro and anti-La, 7 of whom had children with CCHB), 2 monoclonal anti-La antibodies (60), and affinity-purified anti-La antibodies derived from the sera of 2 patients (70) were screened as described elsewhere (28,29,71). A total of 18 possible epitopes was identified as binding exceeding 3.5 SD above the mean reactivity of the normal subjects.

Thirteen of these epitopes were recognized by most of the sera with anti-La antibodies. Eight epitopes were specifically enriched when assayed with affinity-purified anti-La antibodies from 2 patients. Three of these were in the N-terminal region (corresponding to La A described above) and 2 were in the RRM sequence in the middle portion of the molecule (corresponding to La C). Each of the sera from the 7 mothers who had infants with CCHB bound epitopes that share sequence with 3 cardiac-related proteins: β-myosin heavy chain, laminin, and streptococcal M protein. Subsequently, it was shown that a small population of anti-La antibodies cross-reacts with both cardiac myosin and mouse laminin by ELISA (72), with human fetal cardiac laminin by immunofluorescence (73), and with human fetal placental laminin by ELISA, immunoblotting, and immunofluorescence (74). Of interest, the sequence similarity with myosin, in particular tropomyosin and other contractile proteins, was reported by Rauh et al (61) and was described to cover the RNP consensus sequence of La.

Another group of investigators used 7 deletion mutants spanning the La molecule. Three epitopes were defined by screening 11 sera by immunoblot and 28 by ELISA (Figure 3). Epitopes 1 and 2 were bound by the majority of sera, while epitope 3 was bound by fewer sera (75). A high degree of identity between residues 93–100, the C-terminal portion of epitope 1, and resi-

dues 32–39 of feline sarcoma virus gag polyprotein was reported. Several autoantigens (the 70K small nuclear RNP, topoisomerase I, Sm) have been reported to have sequence similarities with retroviral proteins (76–78). As illustrated by Garry (79), these shared sequences are all in exposed regions of the viral protein, and therefore accessible to the immune system. On the other hand, the degree of similarity among these evolutionarily unrelated proteins is expected, and its significance is not known (80,81).

Fragments of the La gene derived by polymerase chain reaction have been used to identify 7 epitopes recognized by immunoblotting of anti-La antibodies from 166 sera. Three commonly bound epitopes were revealed (Figure 3). These included a major cross-reactive epitope found within LaL2/3 and LaC, in the region of the La RRM. The lack of any primary sequence identity suggests that this epitope is dependent on the tertiary structure of the protein. This finding would then be similar to the findings for antibody binding the 60-kd Ro molecule, in which components of tertiary epitopes have been identified (34,35). Longitudinal analysis in a limited number of patients revealed that the initial immune response was to LaA (residues 1–107) and spread to other epitopes during the course of the disease (82). Quantities of anti-La antibodies binding to each of the 3 major epitopes were measured in 84 sera and showed relative amounts, such that anti-LaA > anti-LaC > anti-LaL2/3. The quantities were often in the milligram range, contributing to the hypergammaglobulinemia, although there was a lack of correlation between anti-La and total IgG levels (83).

Detailed mapping by ELISA of the N-terminal epitope (LaA) by expression of overlapping DNA fragments showed that this epitope is a complex conformational or discontinuous epitope dependent on residues 12–28 and 82–99, even though these regions share no amino acid identity with each other (84). This region is highly conserved in mammalian La, whereas sequence divergence within the C-terminal half of the molecule has been found for mouse, bovine, and rat La. Thus, the discovery of a human-specific epitope in the poorly conserved C-terminal region implies that autoantibodies to the LaL2/3 epitope are generated by autoimmunization. Homology across the LaL2/3 region is as low as 44%. Despite the conserved nature of the RNA binding region, La RRM, a lack of cross-reactivity of human anti-La autoantibodies with mouse and bovine RRM was found. The amino acid substitutions in both mouse and bovine La identify 3 residues in human RRM (amino acids 156, 177, and 186) which are therefore of critical importance in controlling recognition of this

determinant (85). Autoantibodies to this region may be important in blocking the RNA binding function of the La protein.

Recombinant fusion proteins corresponding to full-length, N-terminal, central, and C-terminal regions of La have been used to demonstrate that precipitin-negative anti-La-positive sera have restricted epitope recognition. Of 66 sera tested, 18 (27%) reacted with full-length recombinant La, and 8 of these 18 did not react with any other fragment, 5 reacted only with LaA, 4 with LaA and LaC, and 1 with only LaC. None reacted with LaL2/3. These sera were also characterized as less likely to contain rheumatoid factor, and they had significantly lower levels of IgG than precipitin-positive sera. Such sera may represent a distinct anti-La subset (86).

### Summary

The fine specificity of the Ro and La proteins has been studied by several techniques. In general, there is agreement in a qualitative sense that autoantibodies bind multiple epitopes. For some specific antibody binding, different studies agree quantitatively, for instance, the binding of the carboxyl terminus of 60-kd Ro as described by 2 studies (29,39) using different techniques and the presence of an epitope within the leucine zipper of 52-kd Ro. In addition, there is general agreement about the location of a prominent epitope at the RRM motif region of the La molecule. On the other hand, the many specific epitope regions of the molecules differ among these studies. These discrepancies are likely the result of using different techniques, sera, and peptide constructs as well as a result of inherent advantages and disadvantages in the individual approaches.

Several theories concerning the origin of not only the antibodies, but also the diseases themselves, have been generated from studies of the fine specificity of antibody binding. These include a theory of a primordial foreign antigen for anti-Ro autoimmunity, molecular mimicry with regard to La and CCHB, as well as the association of anti-Ro with HLA (35,36). These remain unproven, but are of continuing interest. An explanation for the association of anti-60-kd Ro and anti-52-kd Ro in the sera of patients has sprung from evaluating antibody binding. Data demonstrating multiple epitopes are part of a large body of evidence (for 60-kd Ro, see refs. 7–12 and 87–91) that strongly suggests an antigen-driven immune response. This means that the autoantigens are directly implicated in initiating and sustaining autoimmunity in their associated diseases.

A number of studies have investigated the possibility of differences in the immune response to these

antigens in SS and SLE sera. While several differences have been reported, none have been reproduced in a second cohort of patients. Furthermore, none of the reported differences may be sufficiently robust for clinical purposes, such as distinguishing between SS with systemic features and mild SLE, although some might be promising. For instance, in at least 3 groups of SLE patients, no binding of residues spanning amino acids 21–41 of 60-kd Ro has been found (29, 34–36, 46). Meanwhile, 1 of those studies found that 41% of sera from patients with primary SS bound the 60-kd Ro peptide 21–41 (46). Perhaps future studies will elaborate a clinical role of such a difference among SS and SLE patients.

Study of the epitopes of these autoantigens has, in part, led to a new animal model of anti-Ro and anti-La (87–92). Non-autoimmune-prone animals are immunized with proteins or peptides that make up the Ro/La RNP. Such animals develop an autoimmune response to the entire particle, not just the immunogen. This response has been hypothesized to arise from autoreactive B cells. In another, older animal model of disease, the MRL-lpr/lpr mouse, B cells have recently been shown to be required for the generation of abnormal, autoreactive T cells (93). Thus, there are now powerful data indicating that B cells that produce autoantibodies are directly involved in the pathogenesis of disease above and beyond the formation of immune complexes.

Given that the autoreactive B cell is potentially critical to the underlying pathogenesis of disease, then studying these cells will be crucial to further understanding the origin of diseases associated with Ro and La autoimmunity. Hopefully, an increased understanding will eventually lead to improved treatment of patients. Progress in the area of treatment will almost surely be incremental, and studies of the fine specificity of autoantibody binding will be a part of the body of basic knowledge contributing to ultimate advancement.

In the future, the animal models will need to be examined with regard to immunology and immunochemistry as well as genetics. The development of these autoantibodies has not been studied extensively (94) because upon presentation to medical care, virtually all patients have a full-blown response, including asymptomatic mothers of infants with NLE. Such studies will be possible in the newly developed animal models. At present, direct studies of antibodies binding the conformational structure of these antigens have not been possible, although conformational antibodies have been studied indirectly (34, 35, 42–46, 54, 84). When the tertiary structure is solved by crystallography or other means,

then studies can be begun. Meanwhile, the T cell epitopes of 60-kd Ro, 52-kd Ro, and La have been studied minimally compared with the B cell epitopes. Study of these structures, the T cells that respond to them in the context of HLA molecules, along with continuing B cell epitope studies should give a comprehensive understanding to the autoimmunity directed against the Ro and La RNPs in patients with autoimmune rheumatic illnesses.
