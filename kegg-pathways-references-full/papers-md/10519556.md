Antibiotic-producing polyketide synthases (PKSs) are enzymes responsible for the biosynthesis in *Streptomyces* and related filamentous bacteria of a remarkably broad range of bioactive metabolites, including antitumour aromatic compounds such as mithramycin${}^{1}$ and macrolide antibiotics such as erythromycin${}^{2}$. The molecular basis for the selection of the starter unit on aromatic PKSs is unknown${}^{3}$. Here we show that a component of aromatic PKSs, previously named ‘chain-length factor’${}^{4}$, is a factor required for polyketide chain initiation and that this factor has decarboxylase activity towards malonyl-ACP (acyl carrier protein). We have re-examined the mechanism of initiation on modular PKSs and have identified as a specific initiation factor a domain of previously unknown function named KSQ, which operates like chain-length factor. Both KSQ and chain-length factor are similar to the ketosynthase domains that catalyse polyketide chain extension in modular multifunctional PKSs and in aromatic PKSs, respectively, except that the ketosynthase domain active-site cysteine residue is replaced by a highly conserved glutamine in KSQ and in chain-length factor. The glutamine residue is important both for decarboxylase activity and for polyketide synthesis.

Aromatic PKSs resemble typical bacterial fatty-acid syntheses (FASs) in containing a few largely monofunctional enzyme subunits (type II organization). Each aromatic PKS contains a set of three essential subunits (the ketosynthase (KS), the chain-length factor (CLF)${}^{4}$ and the acyl carrier protein (ACP)), which is referred to as the minimal PKS${}^{5}$. In addition, aromatic PKSs typically contain other enzyme subunits, including specific ketoreductases, cyclases and aromatases which interact with the growing poly-$\beta$-ketoacyl-ACP intermediate to produce characteristic polycyclic aromatic products. Heterologous expression of genes from different aromatic PKS gene clusters has led to the *in vivo* production of many novel polyketide products${}^{3}$, and to the formulation of ‘design rules’ for the rational production of such products by the appropriate mixing and matching of subunits${}^{6}$. These design rules have since required modification, particularly with regard to the proposal, originally based on very limited experimental evidence, that CLF determines the chain length. It is now accepted that a heterologous CLF may not alter the product chain length as predicted${}^{7,8}$, that CLF exerts major influence only in the presence of its cognate KS, and that ketoreductases, cyclases${}^{7-9}$ and aromatases${}^{10}$ may all have a decisive influence on the outcome.

Recent studies on the expression of components of bacterial aromatic PKSs *in vitro* have shown that the purified minimal PKS, namely KS/CLF and ACP, can produce the expected polyketide products when incubated with malonyl-CoA${}^{11-13}$. There is disagreement${}^{12,13}$ over whether polyketide synthesis *in vitro* absolutely requires the presence of purified FAS malonyl-CoA:ACP acyl transferase (MCAT)${}^{11,12}$, as opposed to self-malonylation by the PKS ACP${}^{14}$; however, it is agreed that malonyl-CoA and not acetyl-CoA is the precursor of starter units on the actinorhodin PKS${}^{11,14}$ and the tetracenomycin PKS${}^{12}$. This required decarboxylation has been assumed${}^{11,12}$ to be a function of the KS active site, by analogy with similar decarboxylation that is known to occur on the FAS${}^{15}$ (Fig. 1), and that has been proposed to occur in individual KS active sites of the modular erythromycin PKS${}^{16}$. The KS and CLF subunits of an aromatic PKS are similar in sequence${}^{17}$, but the KS active site has an essential${}^{18,19}$ conserved cysteine (C), whereas in CLF the corresponding residue is a highly conserved glutamine (Q) (Fig. 2). This is striking because when the essential${}^{20}$ active-site cysteine of the animal FAS is treated with iodoacetamide, it is specifically converted

into a carboxamidomethylcysteine residue that is very similar in size, shape and polarity to glutamine¹⁵ (Fig. 1). The treated enzyme is thereby converted from a ketosynthase into a malonyl-CoA decarboxylase¹⁵ and all fatty acid synthesis is abolished. In the normal course of the KS reaction, C–C bond formation is presumably promoted by the presence of an acyl unit on the cysteine. The presence of glutamine instead of cysteine in CLF might render it an effective decarboxylase, and therefore CLF would have the properties required of a chain initiation factor that generates acetyl-ACP *in situ* on the minimal PKS.

We tested this idea using the 'minimal' actinorhodin (*act*) PKS, consisting of KS, CLF and ACP components, which together synthesize the octaketides 1 and 2 *in vitro*³ (Fig. 3). A number of site-specific mutants of the KS (Cys 169) and CLF (Gln 161) subunits of the *act* PKS were constructed. First, mutants were made in which the KS cysteine was substituted by alanine. Such mutants are clearly incapable of catalysing polyketide synthesis. These mutant KS/CLF complexes were purified to homogeneity, and tested for their ability to decarboxylate malonyl-ACP, monitoring the appearance of acetyl-ACP by electrospray mass spectrometry (ESMS)¹⁴. Figure 4a shows that for the mutant KS(Ala)/CLF(Gln) approximately 40% decarboxylation of malonyl-ACP to acetyl-ACP occurred in 60 min under the conditions used (relative molecular mass (*M~r~*) for malonyl-ACP: found, 9,527.6; calculated, 9,528; *M~r~* for acetyl-ACP: found, 9,483.9; calculated, 9,484). A time course for decarboxylation by this mutant is shown in Fig. 4b. Malonyl-ACP was recovered unchanged from the control incubation (no added enzyme) after 60 min (data not shown). The mutant KS(Ala)/CLF(Ala) had no decarboxylase activity and the malonyl-ACP was again recovered unchanged (data not shown). These findings unequivocally implicate the CLF and its active-site glutamine in the provision of the starter unit for aromatic polyketide production. Unexpectedly, the mutant KS(Gln)/CLF(Ala), which was designed to mimic the chemical modification of the KS active-site cysteine with iodoacetamide¹⁵, almost completely decarboxylated malonyl-ACP within one minute under these conditions, as judged by ESMS (Fig. 4a). The single amino-acid change from cysteine to glutamine seems sufficient to convert one activity into the other; however, further work is needed to understand why this mutant is such a potent decarboxylase. The mutant KS(Cys)/CLF(Ala) was also tested for its ability to decarboxylate malonyl-ACP and to synthesize the predicted polyketide products SEK4 (octaketide 1) and SEK4b (octaketide 2) (Fig. 3)¹¹. A significant amount of decarboxylation (up to 20% after 60 min) was seen (data not shown), implying that the KS is also competent to decarboxylate malonyl-ACP and that malonyl-ACP decarboxylase activity of CLF is not absolutely essen-

**Figure 3 Functional analysis of KS/CLF and KSQ.**  
**a**, The minimal *act* PKS system (malonyl-ACP, KS/CLF), which is capable of catalysing the formation octaketides 1 and 2, was used to study decarboxylase activity of mutant KS/CLF constructs *in vitro*.  
**b**, A chimaeric *mon*-loading module/DEBS1-TE construct was used for *in vitro* studies on the substrate specificity of the *mon* loading module. Incubation of purified protein with malonyl-CoA and (2*R*)-methylmalonyl-CoA gave rise to triketide lactone 3, which was not produced in the presence of acetyl-CoA and (2*R*)-methylmalonyl-CoA.

loading modules for type I PKSs, addition of acetyl-CoA would be expected to trigger specific polyketide synthesis, but it did not lead to the production of lactone 3 by either enzyme. In the presence of added malonyl-CoA, the unmutated enzyme produced lactone 3 at the same level as lactone 4; however, production of lactone 3 by the Gln177Ala mutant was reduced more than 10-fold compared with the unmutated enzyme. These results directly support the view that the glutamine residue is specifically important if not essential for polyketide biosynthesis, and that the KSQ domain functions in typical modular PKSs as a chain initiation factor with the same function as the CLF in aromatic PKSs, that is to say that the provision of starter units is through the specific decarboxylation of enzyme-bound extender units by the KSQ. Further work is required to establish whether the observed discrimination between acetate and propionate starter units in KSQ-containing loading modules is governed by the specificity of the AT domain of the loading module for either malonyl-CoA or methylmalonyl-CoA, or by the specificity of the KSQ domain, or both.

The discovery of the common role of CLF and KSQ as chain initiation factors provides an additional important mechanistic link between type I and type II PKSs, and between PKSs and FASs. Our results do not allow us to distinguish whether the active-site glutamine residue catalyses decarboxylation directly, or indirectly by its interaction with nearby amino-acid residues. If the effect proves to be direct, the glutamine residue might be acting as a general acid to polarize the thioester carbonyl group of the malonyl-ACP; alternatively, it could provide general base catalysis by direct bonding to the malonyl carboxyl group. Such roles would also be possible for a glutamate residue, which is found in place of glutamine in the CLF component of aromatic PKSs for spore pigments, typified by the whiE gene product (Fig. 2). Appreciation of the widespread importance of decarboxylation in the provision of starter units for polyketide assembly will probably be of major benefit for current efforts to engineer the biosynthesis of novel, potentially valuable polyketides. It may also assist in the analysis of

### Methods

#### Cloning and expression of chimaeric mon-loading module DEBS1-TE constructs
A chimaeric DEBS1-TE construct, containing the monensin PKS loading module (KSQ-AT-ACP domains; M. Oliynyk, unpublished data) fused to module 1 in DEBS1-TE, was obtained by a strategy previously described for attaching the avermectin PKS loading module (AT-ACP) to DEBS1-TE²⁵. The details of its construction, and that of the KSQ active-site mutant (Gln177Ala) will be given elsewhere (P.F.L., J.C., J.S. and P.F.L., manuscript in preparation). The hybrid PKS genes were expressed in *Saccharopolyspora erythraea* JC2 using the expression plasmid pCJR24 (ref. 26). Purification of chimaeric DEBS1-TE multienzymes from *S. erythraea* JC2 and assays for synthesis of triketide lactones were essentially as described²⁴.

#### Cloning and expression of act PKS genes
Replacements of Cys169 in *act* KS by Ala and Gln, respectively, and substitution of Ala for Gln161 in *act* CLF were performed by site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange, Stratagene) using a plasmid containing the linked *act* KS and CLF genes¹³ as the template for PCR. Expression of the coupled KS and CLF genes in *Streptomyces coelicolor* CH999 (ref. 4) and purification by nickel chelate affinity chromatography were as described¹³.

#### Assay for decarboxylation of malonyl-ACP
Conditions for reconstitution of the minimal *act* PKS have been reported¹³. After incubation of malonyl-ACP with purified KS/CLF, the acyl-ACP fraction was purified by reversed-phase HPLC and the acylation pattern of the ACP moiety was determined by ESMS as described²⁷.

Although all myosin motors so far characterized move towards the barbed (+) end of actin filaments, there may well be cellular roles for oppositely directed myosins, and there are many unconventional myosins that have unknown functions and unusual primary structures²⁸. The simplest way to reverse the direction of movement would be to keep the basic motor with both its actin interface and core nearly identical to other myosins, but to attach the lever arm in such a way that the same movements of the motor core would rotate the lever arm in the opposite direction on actin, as compared with other myosins. We therefore compared the sequences of all known myosins, looking for large differences beginning in the converter domain and ending at the first light-chain-binding motif. Of the 15 known classes of myosins, the members of the myosin VI class were the only ones that fulfilled this criterion. They contain a 53-amino-acid insertion in the converter/lever arm region (Fig. 1); therefore, myosin VI was the best candidate for a reverse-direction myosin.

Class VI myosins were first identified in *Drosophila melanogaster*⁹ and were subsequently found to be expressed in species from *Caenorhabditis elegans* to human⁸,¹⁰⁻¹². Myosin VI has a single

There are differing numbers of light-chain/CaM-binding sites (IQ motifs) among these classes, as well as highly divergent C-terminal regions (to the right of the IQ motifs). **b**, The native myosin VI molecule, with a box around the truncation used in this study.

Myosins and kinesins are molecular motors that hydrolyse ATP to track along actin filaments and microtubules, respectively. Although the kinesin family includes motors that move towards either the plus or minus ends of microtubules¹, all characterized myosin motors move towards the barbed (+) end of actin filaments². Crystal structures of myosin II (refs 3–6) have shown that small movements within the myosin motor core are transmitted through the ‘converter domain’ to a ‘lever arm’ consisting of a light-chain-binding helix and associated light chains⁵,⁶. The lever arm further amplifies the motions of the converter domain into large directed movements³,⁵⁻⁷. Here we report that myosin VI, an unconventional myosin⁸⁻¹², moves towards the pointed (−) end of actin. We visualized the myosin VI construct bound to actin using cryo-electron microscopy and image analysis, and found that an ADP-mediated conformational change in the domain distal to the motor, a structure likely to be the effective lever arm, is in the opposite direction to that observed for other myosins. Thus, it appears that myosin VI achieves reverse-direction movement by rotating its lever arm in the opposite direction to conventional myosin lever arm movement.
