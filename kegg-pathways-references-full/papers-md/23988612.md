Breast cancer is a heterogeneous group of diseases that are clinically subdivided as hormone receptor–positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2–positive (HER2+), and triple-negative breast cancer, to guide therapeutic interventions. Agents that target estrogen receptor (ER) and HER2 are among the most successful cancer therapeutics. However, *de novo* or acquired resistance is common, despite the development of newer agents against these pathways. As our understanding of tumor biology improves, novel targets are being identified. Notably, inhibitors against several pathways [including, among others, the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K/mTOR), cell-cycle regulation, heat shock protein, and epigenetic pathways] have demonstrated promising activity in clinical trials, and the mTOR-inhibitor everolimus has been approved for advanced or metastatic aromatase inhibitor–resistant ER+ breast cancer. At present, there are no established targeted agents for triple-negative breast cancer (negative ER, progesterone receptor, and HER2). Although poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors have shown promising activity in BRCA-related cancers, its value in the treatment of triple-negative breast cancers remains to be demonstrated. In this Review, we present a basic understanding of the major targeted agents in current practice and under development for the treatment of breast cancer in the context of the three clinical subgroups.

### Estrogen receptor (ER) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) are well-established therapeutic targets and have been the main focus of drug development for the treatment of breast cancer. A number of hormonal therapeutic agents have been approved for the treatment of ER+ disease, including tamoxifen, aromatase inhibitors (AIs), and fulvestrant. For HER2+ breast cancer, a growing number of HER2-targeted agents have become available, including trastuzumab, lapatinib, pertuzumab, and trastuzumab emtansine. However, these agents are ineffective for triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC). In addition, *de novo* or acquired resistance to these agents is common, despite the presence of ER and HER2. Novel therapeutic targets are being developed as treatment strategies for TNBC and resistant ER and HER2+ diseases. In this review, we discuss major targeted therapies in current practice and under development for the treatment of hormone receptor–positive (HR+) breast cancer, HER2+ breast cancer, and TNBC.

### HR+ Breast Cancer

HR+ breast cancers are largely driven by the estrogen/ER pathway, and endocrine therapy targeting this pathway has been most successful. However, resistance to endocrine therapy, either *de novo* or acquired, is a common phenomenon and a significant clinical challenge. The mechanisms of endocrine resistance are complex and not fully understood. Experimental models indicate that endocrine resistance is accompanied by activation of estrogen-independent growth and survival signaling pathways as a result of

genomic or epigenetic alterations; these pathways could be targeted for therapeutic interventions.¹ A small fraction of ER⁺ breast cancers have amplification of the HER2 gene, ERBB2, and in these cases targeting both ER and HER2 is necessary.² Letrozole in combination with lapatinib, a HER1/2 inhibitor, has been approved as a first-line therapy for metastatic ER⁺ HER2⁺ breast cancer. For ER⁺ HER2⁻ breast cancer, success has been reported with combined targeting of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway and ER.³ The mTOR inhibitor everolimus, in combination with exemestane, has been approved for the treatment of AI-resistant ER⁺ metastatic breast cancer. Promising activity has also been observed in early-phase trials of inhibitors against cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4/6) and agents that target epigenetic mechanisms.

### Estrogen Receptor

ER, which belongs to the class of steroid hormonal receptors, plays an important role in cell proliferation, survival, and invasion of ER⁺ breast cancer (Figure 1). Binding of estrogen to ER translocates the cytoplasmic ER to the nucleus, where estrogen-bound ER forms dimer that functions as a transcription factor via binding to the estrogen response elements of target genes and the interaction with coregulators and other transcription factors to activate downstream gene expression.⁴ In addition to this classic genomic action of ER, membrane-associated ER mediates rapid nongenomic effect through its interactions with growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases and a variety of proximal signaling molecules such as G protein, Ras, Src, and the regulatory subunit of PI3K and Shc, leading to cell growth and survival signaling activation.

#### ER-Targeted Therapies and Endocrine Therapy

Endocrine therapy is the mainstay of systemic treatment for HR⁺ breast cancer. Various approaches are aimed at either reducing estrogen level, such as ovarian suppression or ablation in premenopausal women and AIs in postmenopausal women, or modulating the expression or function of ER, such as the selective estrogen receptor modulators, which antagonize the function of ER, and fulvestrant, which down-regulates ER.

In premenopausal women with metastatic breast cancer, tamoxifen has efficacy similar to that of ovarian ablation,⁵ whereas the combination of ovarian suppression plus tamoxifen demonstrates a superior disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS), compared with ovarian suppression alone.⁶ In premenopausal women with early-stage disease, 5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen reduced the risk of breast cancer recurrence by 39% [relative risk (RR) for recurrence = 0.61; 95% CI = 0.57–0.65] and the risk of breast cancer mortality by 30% (RR for death = 0.70; 95% CI = 0.64–0.75), which translates into a 15-year absolute reduction of 13% in the risk of recurrence and 9% in the risk of breast cancer mortality. A recent report of results from the Adjuvant Tamoxifen: Longer Against Shorter (ATLAS) trial indicated that 10 years of tamoxifen was associated with a 25% lower recurrence rate and a 29% lower breast cancer mortality rate, compared with 5 years of tamoxifen treatment.⁷ Although the risk of death from endometrial cancer was increased from 0.2% to 0.4%, the benefit outweighed this risk, which argues for the use of 10 years of tamoxifen. For patients who become postmenopausal after 5 years of tamoxifen, extended therapy with an AI is another option, based on the results of the MA17 trial.⁸ As an alternative to tamoxifen, ovarian ablation or suppression

**Figure 1** ER pathway and mechanisms of endocrine resistance. Binding of estrogen leads to activation and dimerization of ER, which translocates to the nucleus and activates target gene expression via interaction with estrogen response element (ERE), coactivators, or other transcription factors. In addition, membrane-bound ER mediates nongenomic action through its interaction with growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases or downstream molecules. These actions of ER could be targeted pharmaceutically to treat ER⁺ breast cancer.
could be considered as an adjuvant therapy for premenopausal women.

In postmenopausal women, AIs have been shown to improve OS, compared with tamoxifen, in the metastatic setting.⁹ All three AIs [letrozole and anastrozole (nonsteroidal); exemestane (steroidal)] have shown similar efficacy in the clinical setting, although non-cross-resistance exists between the nonsteroidal and the steroidal AIs. Options for second or later lines of endocrine therapy include another AI, fulvestrant, tamoxifen, testosterone, megestrol acetate (Megace), or (paradoxically) estradiol, as well as the recently approved the combination of everolimus and exemestane. In this setting, the higher dose of fulvestrant (500 mg i.m. monthly) is now the approved dose, based on the result of the Comparison of Faslodex in Recurrent or Metastatic Breast Cancer (CONFIRM) trial.¹⁰ In postmenopausal women with early-stage disease, multiple large adjuvant trials have demonstrated that monotherapy with an AI for 5 years or a switching strategy (from AI to tamoxifen or from tamoxifen to AI, with a total duration of therapy of 5 years) is superior to tamoxifen (summarized by Rao and Cobleigh¹¹). The BIG 1-98 trial demonstrated similar efficacy with AI monotherapy or a switching strategy with tamoxifen.¹² Thus, AI has become a preferred approach, or at least part of the adjuvant hormonal therapy approach, in postmenopausal women with ER⁺ breast cancer.

### HER2-Targeted Agents in ER⁺ HER2⁺ Breast Cancer

The four HER family members [EGFR (alias HER1), HER2, HER3, and HER4] are tyrosine kinase receptors important in promoting cell growth and survival. The HER2 gene, *ERBB2*, is amplified in approximately 10% of ER⁺ breast cancer. Compared with ER⁺ HER2⁻ disease, ER⁺ HER2⁺ breast cancer is associated with a higher risk of relapse on adjuvant endocrine therapy. This is explained by the finding of incomplete cell-cycle arrest under treatment with endocrine agents alone in the neoadjuvant setting.¹³ The benefit of adding HER2-targeted agents in this patient population was demonstrated in studies of adjuvant trastuzumab in HER2⁺ breast cancer; the ER⁺ HER2⁺ subset derived a significant benefit from trastuzumab in reducing relapse. Thus, adjuvant trastuzumab, in addition to hormonal therapy, is a standard of care for these patients.

In the metastatic setting, trastuzumab in combination with anastrozole was associated with a significantly longer progression-free survival (PFS) (4.8 versus 2.4 months) and a higher clinical benefit rate (CBR) (42.7% versus 20.3%), compared with anastrozole alone, in patients with metastatic breast cancer in the phase III Trastuzumab in Dual HER2 ER-Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer (TAnDEM) trial, although OS was not different.¹⁴ In a single-arm trial in patients with HR⁺ HER2⁺ breast cancer, trastuzumab in combination with letrozole as first- or second-line therapy was associated with an overall response rate (ORR) of 26% and a CBR of 52%, with 25% of patients experiencing durable response that lasted for more than 1 year.¹⁵ In a phase III trial conducted in 1298 postmenopausal women with metastatic or locally advanced ER⁺ breast cancer, the combination of letrozole and lapatinib, a HER1/HER2 kinase inhibitor, was compared with letrozole alone.² This study demonstrated a significant difference in PFS [8.2 versus 3 months; hazard ratio (HR) = 0.53–0.96] and ORR (28% versus 15%; *P* = 0.021) favoring the combination therapy group to letrozole alone² and leading to the approval of letrozole and lapatinib combination for the treatment of advanced ER⁺/HER2⁺ breast cancer.

#### PI3K-AKT-mTOR Signaling Pathway Inhibitors

The PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway is a cardinal nodal point in the transduction of extracellular and intracellular growth and survival signals (Figure 2). Deregulation of this pathway is an important mechanism of endocrine resistance.¹⁶ Gain-of-function mutations in the PI3 kinase α catalytic subunit gene (*PIK3CA*) occur at a frequency of 30% to 40% and comprise the most frequent genetic abnormality in ER⁺ breast cancer.¹⁷ In preclinical models, ER⁺ breast cancer carrying *PIK3CA* mutations was highly dependent on PI3Kα (alias p110α) for cell survival.¹⁸ Knockdown of *PIK3CA* using RNAi or inhibition of PI3K or AKT with small-molecule inhibitors induced apoptosis in the presence of estrogen deprivation in ER⁺ breast cancer cell lines.¹⁸,¹⁹ In addition, the development of acquired endocrine resistance was accompanied by activation of the PI3K pathway in studies of long-term estradiol-deprived breast cancer cell lines, and inhibition of PI3K pathway signaling reduced cancer cell growth and survival.¹⁹,²⁰

The rapamycin analogs, which are allosteric inhibitors of mTOR complex 1 through its interaction with FKBP12, were among the first evaluated in clinical trials. The Breast Cancer Trials of Oral Everolimus-2 (BOLERO-2) trial, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III study of exemestane with or without the rapamycin analog everolimus (Afinitor; Novartis) in postmenopausal women with ER⁺ HER2⁻ advanced breast cancer refractory to nonsteroidal AIs, demonstrated a median PFS of 10.6 months with combination therapy, compared with 4.1 months with exemestane alone (HR = 0.36; 95% CI = 0.27–0.47; *P* < 0.001),³ leading to U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for its application in the AI-resistant population. Similarly, the TAMRAD trial, a randomized phase II study of tamoxifen with or without everolimus in postmenopausal women with HR⁺ HER2⁻, AI-resistant metastatic breast cancer, demonstrated an improvement in CBR and time to progression (TTP).²¹ Adjuvant studies of everolimus in combination with hormonal therapy in early-stage ER⁺ HER2⁻ breast cancer are being planned (NCT01805271 and NCT01674140).

The antitumor activity of the rapamycin analogs is likely hindered by feedback up-regulation of AKT,²² and preclinical studies indicated that perhaps the upstream inhibitors that

Figure 2 PI3K pathway and inhibitors. Class IA PI3K is composed of a p85 regulatory domain and a p110α kinase domain. The inhibitory effect of p85 on the kinase domain is released after activation of the tyrosine kinase receptors (RTKs) by ligand binding. PI3K is also activated by Ras. PI3K functions to convert the PI(4,5)P2 to PI(3,4,5)P3, which leads to downstream AKT activation. The function of PI3K is opposed by the function of PTEN. PI(3,4)P2, another active phospholipid, is formed through the action of SHIP-1/2 and inactivated by INPP4B through dephosphorylation. Agents that target the components of PI3K pathway are shown.

target AKT or PI3K directly would be more effective.¹⁸,¹⁹ A number of inhibitors against AKT or PI3K are in clinical trial, including the pan-PI3K isoform inhibitors, dual PI3K and mTOR inhibitors, and isoform-specific inhibitors (Table 1). The pan-PI3K inhibitor BKM120 (Novartis) is in phase III trials in combination with fulvestrant in patients with metastatic ER⁺ metastatic breast cancer resistant to prior AI therapy [Buparlisib Breast Cancer Clinical Evaluation 2 (BELLE 2); NCT01610284] or resistant also to an mTOR inhibitor (BELLE 3; NCT01633060). In addition, an α-specific inhibitor of PI3K has shown promising activity in PIK3CA mutant breast cancer in phase I studies.²³ In the preliminary report of a phase I study of the α-specific inhibitor BYL719 (Novartis), 6/18 (33%) patients with heavily pretreated metastatic breast cancer with PIK3CA mutation achieved tumor shrinkage >20%, and two of these six patients achieved a partial response.²³ Full results from these studies are eagerly awaited. A challenge in the development of these agents has been the inability to identify the predictors of response in clinical trials, and prospective studies are needed.

CDK4/6 Inhibitors

The G1-to-S phase transition is controlled by CDKs 4 and 6. These are activated on binding to D-type cyclins, leading to phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene (RB1) product (Rb), which releases the E2F and DP transcription factors to drive expression from genes promoting S-phase entry (Figure 3). There is a strong link between the action of estrogen and CDK4/6 activity, through the transcriptional regulation of cyclin D1 by ER. Persistent cyclin

neoadjuvant studies of PD 0332991 in combination with Alis in patients with clinical stage II or III ER+ HER2 breast cancer are ongoing (NCT 01723774 and NCT 01709370). There is also a phase I study of PD 0332991 in combination with paclitaxel in metastatic breast cancer, to evaluate the toxicity and the maximum tolerated dose of this combination (NCT 01320592). Although preclinical studies indicated that CCND1 amplification, loss of CDKN2A (p16), and intact RB1 predict response to PD 0332991, clinical evaluation of these markers is ongoing.

Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors

Histone deacetylases (HDACs) and histone acetyltransferases are important epigenetic mechanisms that regulate gene transcription through alterations in chromatin structures.

Figure 3 CDK 4/6 and G1-to-S phase transition. Cell-cycle progression is controlled by CDKs, which are activated by their interactions with cyclins. The G1-to-S phase transition is regulated by CDK 4/6 kinases through the interaction with cyclin D, which is a direct target for estrogen or other growth factors and is frequently amplified in ER+ breast cancer. CDK 4/6 is negatively regulated by specific and universal inhibitors, including p16, p18, p21, and p27. CDK 4/6 phosphorylate Rb, which releases the E2F transcription factors and activates expression of genes required for G1-to-S phase transition. CDK 4/6 is pharmacologically inhibited by PD 0332991 (PD991).

**Figure 4** Targeted therapy for HER2<sup>+</sup> breast cancer. Trastuzumab binds the extracellular domain of HER2. Pertuzumab binds another HER2 domain, preventing dimerization. Trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) allows this thioester-linked chemotherapeutic to act on microtubules. Tanespimycin inhibits HSP90, causing HER2 conformation change. Lapatinib is a small-molecule tyrosine kinase that inhibits HER1 and HER2. Similarly, neratinib inhibits HER1, HER2, and HER4.

Epigenetic deregulation of ER and growth factor receptor pathway components plays an important role in the development of endocrine resistance.<sup>28</sup> In preclinical models, HDAC inhibitors down-regulate the transcription level of ER<sup>29</sup> and induce apoptotic cell death.<sup>30,31</sup>

Early-phase clinical trials of HDAC inhibitors in combination with hormonal therapy in patients with AI-resistant breast cancer have shown encouraging results, suggesting that HDAC inhibition may be an effective strategy to overcome resistance in ER<sup>+</sup> disease. In a phase II trial of vorinostat (Zolinza; Merck) in combination with tamoxifen in patients with ER<sup>+</sup> metastatic breast cancer progressed on prior endocrine therapy (*n* = 43), the overall response rate was 19% and the clinical benefit (defined as stable disease >24 weeks) was 40%.<sup>32</sup> Results were recently reported from a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase II study of exemestane with or without entinostat, an oral inhibitor of class I HDACs, in postmenopausal women with locally recurrent or metastatic ER<sup>+</sup> breast cancer progressed on treatment with a nonsteroidal AI.<sup>33</sup> The study enrolled 130 women; for the group receiving entinostat with exemestane versus exemestane alone, median PFS was 4.3 versus 2.3 months (HR = 0.73; 95% CI = 0.5–1.07; *P* = 0.06) and OS was 28.1 versus 19.8 months (HR = 0.59; 95% CI = 0.36–0.97; *P* = 0.036). The most common adverse events were fatigue and neutropenia, but the treatment was generally considered well tolerated. Prolonged PFS was observed in the subset of patients treated with combination therapy and found to have hyperacetylation of protein lysine in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells. A phase III confirmatory study of this combination is planned. Other HDAC inhibitors being evaluated in breast cancer trials include panobinostat and vorinostat,<sup>28</sup> with results pending. In addition, HDAC inhibitors are being evaluated in TNBC to induce estrogen receptor expression and endocrine responsiveness.<sup>28</sup>

### Other Pathways of Interest in ER<sup>+</sup> Breast Cancer

Other pathways being examined in ER<sup>+</sup> breast cancer include the IGF-1R, FGFR, Src, and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, as well as angiogenic pathways, with most still in early-phase clinical trials.<sup>1</sup>

### HER2<sup>+</sup> Breast Cancer

The HER2 protein, encoded by the *ERBB2* gene, is one of four members of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family: EGFR (alias HER1, ErbB1), HER2 (alias c-ErbB-2; in rodents, Neu), HER3 (alias ErbB3), and HER4 (ErbB4). HER2 is the preferred dimerization partner for the other three family members. Hetero- or homodimerization of EGFR family members leads to autophosphorylation of the receptor tyrosine residues to initiate downstream signaling activation for cell growth and differentiation. Overexpression of HER2 as a result of gene amplification occurs in 18% to 20% of human breast cancers and is associated with a more aggressive phenotype. Introduction of the monoclonal antibody trastuzumab has led to significant improvement in the outcome of this disease. In addition to trastuzumab, several HER2-targeted agents, including lapatinib, pertuzumab, and trastuzumab emtansine have been approved for treatment of advanced HER2<sup>+</sup> disease (Figure 4). Furthermore, agents targeting several molecular pathways implicated in trastuzumab resistance have shown promising results in early-phase clinical trials.

### Trastuzumab

Trastuzumab (Herceptin; Genentech), a fully humanized monoclonal antibody against HER2 extracellular domain, is

[ajp.amjpathol.org](https://ajp.amjpathol.org) ■ The American Journal of Pathology
approved for both metastatic and adjuvant therapy for HER2<sup>+</sup> breast cancer. The mechanisms of action of trastuzumab are not fully understood, but studies have shown that trastuzumab functions by antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, inhibition of the cleavage of the HER2 extracellular domain, inhibition of signaling mediated by HER2 through PI3K, and MAPK cascades. The activities of trastuzumab in combination with various chemotherapy agents have been demonstrated in multiple clinical trials. In the pivotal phase III trial, the addition of trastuzumab to chemotherapy in the first-line setting for metastatic HER2<sup>+</sup> breast cancer resulted in a significant improvements in ORR (50% versus 32%), median TTP (7.4 versus 4.6 months), and median OS (25 versus 20 months).<sup>34</sup> In the adjuvant setting, 1 year of trastuzumab started concurrently with chemotherapy [with a taxane as part of the anthracycline/taxane adjuvant chemotherapy regimen or with docetaxel (Taxotere; Sanofi) in combination with carboplatin] or after the completion of adjuvant chemotherapy, has been shown to dramatically reduce the risk of relapse by approximately one half and to reduce the risk of death by one third.<sup>35–39</sup> Subsequent data from the North Central Cancer Treatment Group (NCCTG) N9831 study demonstrated that administration of trastuzumab concurrent with chemotherapy is preferred.<sup>38</sup> At 8 years of median follow-up of the HERA trial, DFS and OS were similar between the 1- and 2-year duration in the trastuzumab treatment arms, confirming 1 year of trastuzumab as the standard<sup>40</sup> (although a small study of 9 weeks of trastuzumab added to adjuvant chemotherapy also reduced the risk of recurrence at a similar magnitude<sup>41</sup>).

### Trastuzumab Resistance

Unfortunately, not all patients with HER2<sup>+</sup> breast cancer respond to trastuzumab therapy. Furthermore, in the metastatic setting, tumors that initially respond to trastuzumab often develop treatment resistance. Proposed mechanisms of resistance include inability for trastuzumab to bind to its target due to a truncated HER2 receptor that lacks the extracellular domain (p95-HER2) or due to steric hindrance by overexpression of the membrane-associated glycoprotein MUC4, crosstalk with IGF-1R, increased activity of other HER family members, activation of PI3K/Akt pathway as a result of various mechanisms including PTEN deficiency, activating mutations of AKT, or up-regulation of Rac1 (a Ras-like small GTPase that interferes the trastuzumab-mediated endocytosis of HER2). These various mechanisms are being explored for therapeutic strategies to overcome trastuzumab resistance.

### Lapatinib

Lapatinib is an orally available small-molecule inhibitor effective against both HER1 and HER2, although its use has been limited largely to HER2<sup>+</sup> breast cancer. In a randomized phase III study of capecitabine with or without lapatinib in patients with HER2<sup>+</sup> locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer who had previously received anthracycline, taxane, and trastuzumab, the combination therapy was superior in median TTP (8.4 months versus 4.4 months), compared with capecitabine alone.<sup>42</sup> The combination therapy was commonly associated with diarrhea (60%, including 12% grade 3), hand-foot syndrome (49%), rash (27%), nausea (44%), vomiting (26%), and fatigue (18%). There was a trend toward better OS with the combination therapy, but this did not reach statistical significance.<sup>43</sup> Although the analysis was confounded by the crossover of patients from the monotherapy to the combination therapy arm, this trial led to FDA approval of lapatinib in the advanced disease setting. Lapatinib has also been shown to improve TTP when combined with paclitaxel as first-line therapy for patients with metastatic HER2<sup>+</sup> breast cancer, although with a significant increase in adverse effects.<sup>44</sup>

Combined HER2 targeting with lapatinib and trastuzumab has been shown to be effective in the treatment of trastuzumab-resistant metastatic HER2<sup>+</sup> breast cancer. In a randomized phase III study of lapatinib versus the combination of lapatinib and trastuzumab in patients with HER2<sup>+</sup> metastatic breast cancer who had disease progression on prior trastuzumab-based therapy, the combination was associated with improved PFS (HR = 0.73; 95% CI = 0.57–0.93; *P* = 0.008) and CBR (24.7% versus 12.4%; *P* = 0.01), as well as a reduction in risk of death by 26% (median OS, 14 versus 9.5 months; *P* = 0.026).<sup>45</sup> Based on this trial, some have adopted this combination strategy in the clinical practice in patients for whom no chemotherapy is administered.

The activity of lapatinib and the combination of lapatinib and trastuzumab observed in the advanced disease setting led to its further evaluation in patients with early-stage diseases. The Neoadjuvant Lapatinib and/or Trastuzumab Treatment Optimization (NeoALTTO) study compared lapatinib, trastuzumab, and their combination, administered initially for 6 weeks followed by the addition of weekly paclitaxel for 12 weeks before surgery,<sup>46</sup> with the primary endpoint of pathological complete response rate (pCR, defined as absence of invasive tumor cells in the breast). No major cardiac dysfunction was recorded, but lapatinib-containing arms recorded an increased grade 3 diarrhea and liver-enzyme alterations, compared with the trastuzumab-alone arm. There was no statistical difference in the rate of pCR between the single-agent lapatinib arm [38/154 (24.7%); 95% CI = 18.1–32.3] and the trastuzumab arm (difference, −4.8%; 95% CI = −17.6 to 8.2; *P* = 0.34). The pCR rate, however, was significantly higher in the combined lapatinib and trastuzumab arm [78/152 (51.3%); 95% CI = 43.1–59.5], compared with the trastuzumab-alone arm [44/149 (29.5%) patients; 95% CI = 22.4% to 37.5%), confirming the enhanced activity with combined HER2-targeted agents.

In the adjuvant setting, the Adjuvant Lapatinib and/or Trastuzumab Treatment Optimization (ALTTO) trial has completed accrual. Patients with early-stage HER2<sup>+</sup> breast
Mohamed et al

cancer (node-positive or breast tumor ≥1 cm) were randomized to receive trastuzumab for 1 year or lapatinib for 1 year or trastuzumab followed by lapatinib for a total of 1 year versus trastuzumab in combination with lapatinib for 1 year. The study enrolled 8381 patients in approximately 50 countries during June 2007 and 2011. Based on the report of the first planned interim analysis of the ALTTO Independent Data Monitoring Committee that the lapatinib-alone arm was unlikely to meet the prespecified criteria to demonstrate noninferiority to trastuzumab alone with respect to DFS, the leadership of ALTTO announced the discontinuation of the lapatinib-alone arm on September 9, 2011. Full results of the ALTTO trial are eagerly awaited.

### Pertuzumab

Pertuzumab is an anti-HER2 humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to subdomain II of the extracellular domain of HER2, in contrast to trastuzumab, which binds to subdomain IV. Binding of pertuzumab inhibits the dimerization of HER2 with other HER family members (most notably HER3) and synergizes with trastuzumab in treating HER2+ breast cancer in both preclinical [47] and clinical studies. [48] The phase III Clinical Evaluation of Pertuzumab and Trastuzumab (CLEOPATRA) trial randomized patients with metastatic HER2+ breast cancer to trastuzumab plus docetaxel, with or without pertuzumab as first-line treatment. [48] The addition of pertuzumab led to a significant improvement in median PFS (18.5 months versus 12.4 months; HR = 0.62; 95% CI = 0.51–0.75; P < 0.001). The combination therapy was generally well tolerated, with the most common adverse event being diarrhea (64%).

There was no increase in left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Although data are still maturing for OS analysis, the interim analysis indicated a strong trend in favor of pertuzumab group. This trial has led to FDA approval for pertuzumab in combination with a taxane and trastuzumab as first-line therapy for HER2+ metastatic disease.

In the early-stage disease setting, pertuzumab was shown to improve the rate of pCR, without significantly increasing the toxicity, when combined with docetaxel and trastuzumab before surgery in the randomized four-arm phase II NeoSphere trial, which was conducted in patients with newly diagnosed early-stage HER2+ breast cancer. [49] A significantly higher pCR rate was observed for the triplet therapy: 45.8% (95% CI = 36.1–55.7), compared with 29.0% (95% CI = 20.6–38.5; P = 0.0141) for trastuzumab plus docetaxel, 24.0% (95% CI = 15.8–33.7; P = 0.003) for pertuzumab plus docetaxel arm. The pCR rate of 16.8% after the treatment with only the two antibodies to HER2, without chemotherapy, is striking, indicating that a subset of HER2+ breast cancer is likely cured with combined HER2 targeting approach without the use of chemotherapy. A randomized phase III trial of trastuzumab and chemotherapy with or without pertuzumab is being conducted to evaluate the role of pertuzumab in the adjuvant setting for patients with early-stage HER2+ breast cancer (NCT01358877).

### Trastuzumab Emtansine

Trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) (Kadcyla; Genentech) is an antibody-drug conjugate in which trastuzumab is linked to the microtubule-inhibitory agent mertansine (DM1). [50] Based on the results of the EMILIA trial, T-DM1 was approved by the FDA in February 2013 for the treatment of patients with HER2+ metastatic breast cancer who had previously received trastuzumab and a taxane, separately or in combination. In this highly publicized trial, 991 patients with HER2+ metastatic breast cancer previously treated with a taxane and trastuzumab were randomized to therapy with lapatinib plus capecitabine versus T-DM1. Median PFS by independent review was 9.6 months with T-DM1, compared with 6.4 months in the lapatinib plus capecitabine arm (HR for progression or death from any cause = 0.65; 95% CI = 0.55–0.77; P < 0.001). At the second interim analysis, median OS crossed the stopping boundary for efficacy, favoring T-DM1 with 30.9 months versus 25.1 months (P < 0.001). T-DM1 was associated with a higher ORR (43.6% versus 30.8%; P < 0.001), and lower toxicities of grade 3 or above, compared with lapatinib plus capecitabine. The most common grade 3 or 4 AEs associated with T-DM1 are thrombocytopenia (12.9%), elevated AST (4.3%), and ALT (2.9%). In addition, T-DM1 did not appear to be associated with an increased cardiac risk.

### Investigational Agents for HER2+ Breast Cancer

#### Neratinib

Neratinib is an orally available pan-HER irreversible tyrosine kinase inhibitor. A phase II trial of neratinib in patients with metastatic HER2+ breast cancer demonstrated a 16-week PFS of 59% in those with prior trastuzumab therapy and 78% in patients with no prior trastuzumab treatment, with median PFS of 22.3 and 39.6, respectively. [51] The most common adverse effect was diarrhea, but this was manageable with antidiarrheal agents and dose reductions. A randomized phase III trial comparing the combination of neratinib plus capecitabine against the combination of lapatinib plus capecitabine in patients with HER2+ metastatic breast cancer who have received two or more prior HER2-directed regimens in the metastatic setting is being conducted (NCT01808573). In addition, a phase II trial of neratinib in patients with metastatic HER2+ breast cancer and progressive brain metastasis with the primary objective of ORR in the central nervous system is being conducted to investigate its potential for central nervous system metastasis (NCT01494662). In the subset of patients who are candidates for craniotomy, tissue neratinib concentration is assessed from craniotomy specimens, cerebrospinal fluid, and plasma. In addition, neratinib is being evaluated in a phase II trial in patients with ERBB2 mutant but nonamplified metastatic

breast cancer, based on promising preclinical data (NCT01670877). Neratinib is further discussed below, in the section on somatic ERBB2 mutation without amplification.

HSP90 Inhibitors

Heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) is a molecular chaperone important for the proper folding and conformational stability of a variety of client proteins, including HER2 and p95-HER2, that are important in the oncogenic process of cancer cells. In preclinical models, inhibition of HSP90 leads to degradation of HER2 and p95-HER2, tumor cell apoptosis, and growth inhibition.⁵² In a phase I trial of trastuzumab in combination with the HSP90 inhibitor alvespimycin (17-DMAG), one confirmed partial response was observed, and seven cases of stable disease (lasting 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 months), in 21 patients with heavily pretreated metastatic HER2⁺ breast cancer.⁵³ A phase II trial of the HSP90 inhibitor tanespimycin (17-AAG) in combination with trastuzumab was conducted in patients with HER2⁺ metastatic breast cancer after progression on trastuzumab. This trial enrolled 31 patients, with a primary endpoint of response rate according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria. The ORR was 22%, and the median PFS was 6 months (95% CI = 4 to 9 months), demonstrating a proof of concept that HSP90 inhibitors are effective agents for HER2⁺ breast cancer. Unfortunately, tanespimycin was suspended for further clinical development. Other novel heat shock protein inhibitors are in clinical development, and results are eagerly awaited.⁵⁵

PI3K Pathway Inhibition

PI3K pathway activation is an important mechanism of treatment resistance to trastuzumab.⁵⁶ Several studies have shown promising results with agents that target the PI3K pathway in HER2⁺ breast cancer. In a pooled analysis of two small studies of the mTOR inhibitor everolimus in combination with trastuzumab in metastatic HER2⁺ breast cancer that progressed on previous trastuzumab-based therapy, a partial response rate of 15%, CBR [calculated as partial response + complete response + persistent stable disease (≥6 months)] of 34%, and a median PFS of 4.1 months were observed.⁵⁷ The combination of everolimus with weekly trastuzumab and paclitaxel yielded an ORR of 44% and an overall disease control rate (≥6 months) of 74% in a phase I study of this regimen in a heavily pretreated HER2⁺ metastatic breast cancer population.⁵⁸ In a phase Ib trial of everolimus in combination with trastuzumab and vinorelbine in patients with HER2⁺ metastatic breast cancer previously treated with trastuzumab, an ORR of 19.1% with a disease control rate of 83.0% and median PFS of 30.7 weeks was observed in this heavily pretreated patient population.⁵⁹ These encouraging results led to subsequent phase III trials evaluating the combination of everolimus and trastuzumab with paclitaxel in the first-line setting (BOLERO-1; NCT00876395), and with vinorelbine in the

second- or third-line setting (BOLERO-3; NCT01007942) for the treatment of HER2⁺ locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. Early-phase trials are ongoing that evaluate direct PI3K or AKT inhibitors for the treatment of metastatic HER2⁺ breast cancer (Table 1).

Somatic ERBB2 Mutation in Breast Cancers Lacking ERBB2 Amplification

A total of 27 somatic mutations in ERBB2 were identified, with an incidence of 1.6% (25/1500), in patients with breast cancer lacking ERBB2 gene amplification who participated in eight breast cancer genome-sequencing projects (summarized by Robert et al⁶⁰). A majority of these ERBB2 somatic mutations were found to increase the kinase activity and were able to induce *in vitro* cell transformation and xenograft tumor growth when overexpressed.⁶¹ Importantly, these mutations were sensitive to neratinib, although some were resistant to lapatinib. Several mutations that cluster in the extracellular domain were found to be oncogenic and were sensitive to neratinib in preclinical studies.⁶² These studies indicate that somatic mutation is an alternative mechanism to ERBB2 gene amplification in activating HER2 in breast cancer. A prospective, multi-institutional phase II trial of neratinib in metastatic ERBB2 mutant but nonamplified breast cancers has been launched to evaluate the efficacy of neratinib in this patient population (NCT01670877).

TNBC

Triple-negative breast cancer is a phenotypic description of breast cancers that do not express ER and progesterone receptor and are also without HER2 overexpression or amplification. Unlike ER⁺ or HER2⁺ breast cancers, there is no approved targeted therapy for TNBC. Although some TNBCs are cured with standard surgery and adjuvant therapy, those with chemoresistant disease tend to have an aggressive clinical course, manifested as early and visceral relapses. Intense effort has been devoted to identification of novel therapeutic targets for TNBC; however, the molecular heterogeneity and complex biology of TNBC pose significant challenges to development of targeted agents. Some progress has been made in classifying TNBC into subtypes with differing gene expression profiles,⁶³,⁶⁴ but the therapeutic implications are yet to be elucidated. Pathways and agents being examined in clinical trials include antiangiogenic agents, EGFR, and PARP inhibitors, as well as PI3K, Src, and CDKs.

Antiangiogenic Agents

Angiogenesis is an essential step for tumor growth and metastasis, and vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs), particularly VEGF-A, are among the most prominent factors in inducing pathological angiogenesis.⁶⁵ Compared with
other breast cancer subtypes, TNBC has been associated with significantly higher levels of intratumor VEGF-A expression, [66] which provides a rationale for evaluation of anti-VEGF agents in the treatment of TNBC, even though these agents are not necessarily classified as bona fide targeted therapeutics. Bevacizumab (Avastin; Genentech) is a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against VEGF-A. In initial studies of bevacizumab in breast cancer, performed in unselected patients with metastatic HER2− disease, the addition of bevacizumab to standard chemotherapy improved ORR and PFS, but not OS. [60,67–69] Three randomized, placebo-controlled phase III trials of bevacizumab were conducted in the first-line metastatic setting: the E2100 trial (with paclitaxel), [67] the Avado trial (with docetaxel), [68] and the Ribbon 1 trial (with an anthracycline-, taxane-, or capecitabine-based regimen). [60] In the subgroup analysis within each individual trial, patients with TNBC had considerable improvement in ORR and PFS in the E2100 and the Avado trials, [67,68] but no significant improvement was observed in the Ribbon 1 trial. [60] A meta-analysis was performed that included 621 patients with TNBC enrolled in these three trials (chemotherapy alone, $n = 258$; chemotherapy in combination with bevacizumab, $n = 363$). A significant improvement was observed in PFS (8.1 months versus 5.4 months; HR = 0.65; $P < 0.0001$) and ORR (42% versus 23%; $P < 0.0001$) with the combination therapy; however, no OS benefit was observed (17.5 versus 18.9 months). [70]

The Ribbon 2 trial investigated the combination of bevacizumab with the physician’s choice of either capecitabine, a taxane (paclitaxel, nab-paclitaxel, or docetaxel), gemcitabine, or vinorelbine as second-line treatment for metastatic HER2− breast cancer; this trial demonstrated an improvement in PFS, but not OS. [69] In the subgroup analysis of 159 patients with TNBC, compared with chemotherapy alone, the addition of bevacizumab significantly improved ORR (41% versus 18%; $P = 0.0078$) and PFS (6.0 months versus 2.7 months; HR = 0.494; 95% CI = 0.33–0.74; $P = 0.0006$). There was a trend toward improved OS (17.9 versus 12.6 months; HR = 0.624; 95% CI = 0.39–1.007; $P = 0.0534$). [71]

In the neoadjuvant setting, randomized studies of bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy have yielded conflicting results. In the GeparQuinto trial ($n = 1948$), the rate of pCR was significantly higher with the addition of bevacizumab to the epirubicin plus cyclophosphamide followed by docetaxel regimen (14.9% versus 18.4%; odds ratio with addition of bevacizumab, 1.29; 95% CI = 1.02–1.65; $P = 0.04$). [72] The benefit was restricted to the TNBC subpopulation ($n = 663$; pCR rate, 27.9% versus 39.3%; $P = 0.003$), compared with a pCR rate of 7.7% and 7.8% with and without the addition of bevacizumab, respectively, among 1262 patients with HR+ tumors ($P = 1.00$). However, these findings were not reproduced in the NSABP B-40 trial. [73] Although adding bevacizumab to gemcitabine-docetaxel chemotherapy significantly improved the rate of pCR (28.2% without bevacizumab versus 34.5% with

bevacizumab; $P = 0.02$) in the population overall, the effect of bevacizumab was more pronounced in the HR+ subset (15.1% without bevacizumab versus 23.2% with bevacizumab; $P = 0.007$) than in the HR− subset (47.1% without bevacizumab versus 51.5% with bevacizumab; $P = 0.34$).

Preliminary data were recently reported from the phase III Bevacizumab Adjuvant Therapy in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (BEATRICE) trial, which randomized 2591 patients with TNBC to standard adjuvant chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab in the adjuvant setting. [74] There was no difference in the primary endpoint, invasive disease-free survival, between the two treatment arms. Compared with those in the chemotherapy-alone arm, patients in the bevacizumab arm had a higher incidence of grade 3 hypertension in the combination therapy arm (7% during the chemotherapy phase and 5% during the bevacizumab maintenance phase, compared with less than 1% in the chemotherapy-alone arm), proteinuria (2% during the maintenance phase), congestive heart failure, and left ventricular dysfunction.

The TNBC subgroup, treatment schedule, and findings for these seven studies targeting VEGFs are summarized in Table 2.

The lack of a positive effect of bevacizumab in TNBC underscores the need to better understand predictive biomarkers. Biomarker analyses from the AVADO trial identified that high plasma VEGF-A and VEGFR-2 at baseline were associated with a greater PFS benefit from bevacizumab. [75] Similar findings were reported from the AVEREL trial of bevacizumab in combination with trastuzumab and docetaxel in metastatic HER2+ breast cancer. [76] The validity of VEGF-A level as a predictive biomarker of bevacizumab benefit is being examined in a prospective trial (MERiDiAN, GO25632; NCT01663727) in which patients are stratified based on baseline plasma VEGF-A concentrations before randomization to weekly paclitaxel in combination with either bevacizumab or placebo.

Sunitinib and sorafenib are multitargeted inhibitors of receptor tyrosines, including VEGFR. In phase III studies, single-agent sunitinib was inferior to capecitabine in previously treated metastatic HER2− breast cancer. [77] In addition, sunitinib failed to improve PFS when combined with docetaxel in the first-line setting [78] or with capecitabine in previously treated metastatic HER2− breast cancer. [79] In patients with metastatic TNBC, single-agent sunitinib led to a worse PFS than standard care in a phase II study. [80]

Fewer studies have been performed for sorafenib for metastatic breast cancer. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase IIb trial in patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2− breast cancer, the addition of sorafenib to capecitabine resulted in a significant improvement in PFS, compared with placebo (median, 6.4 versus 4.1 months; HR = 0.58; 95% CI = 0.41–0.81; $P = 0.001$), with sorafenib favored across subgroups, including first-line (HR = 0.50; 95% CI = 0.30–0.82) and second-line (HR = 0.65; 95% CI = 0.41–1.04) treatment. [81] Confirmation in phase III trials is needed.

### Targeting EGFR

Most basal-like breast cancers, the major molecular subtype of TNBC, overexpress EGFR,<sup>82</sup> raising the possibility of targeting EGFR in TNBC. However, limited phase II trials of EGFR-targeted agents in TNBC have not demonstrated significant effect. In a phase II study that evaluated weekly irinotecan plus carboplatin with or without cetuximab as first- or second-line therapy in patients with metastatic breast cancer, the addition of cetuximab led to an improved response rate (30% versus 49%), but without any benefit in PFS and OS among patients with TNBC.<sup>83</sup> The TBCRC 001 study evaluated cetuximab alone followed by the addition of carboplatin at progression versus the combination therapy from the start in patients with metastatic TNBC.<sup>84</sup> The RR was 6% to cetuximab alone, 16% to cetuximab plus carbo- platin after progression, and 17% to the cetuximab plus carboplatin started at the beginning; however, TTP and OS were short, at 2.1 months (95% CI = 1.8 to 5.5 months) and 10.4 months (95% CI = 7.7 to 13.1 months), respectively, despite combination therapy. Although most TNBCs had activated EGFR signaling, only a few demonstrated pathway inhibition after cetuximab treatment. In another study, the BALI-1 trial, addition of cetuximab to cisplatin improved PFS (3.7 months versus 1.5 months; HR = 0.67; $P = 0.03$) and increased RR (20% versus 10.3%; $P = 0.11$), but the study failed to reach the primary objective.<sup>85</sup>

In regards to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors, neither gefitinib nor erlotinib showed promise in the metastatic and locally advanced disease setting.<sup>86–89</sup> Additional trials are ongoing to evaluate erlotinib plus chemotherapy in the neo- adjuvant setting (NCT00491816) and gefitinib in EGFR+ metastatic TNBC (NCT01732276).

### PARP Inhibitors

The poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs) are a group of enzymes important in many cellular processes, including base excision repair of single-strand DNA breaks, a vital mechanism for DNA damage repair when homologous recombination repair mechanisms such as BRCA1/2 are deficient. PARP inhibitors induced synthetic lethality in BRCA1- and BRCA2-related tumors in preclinical studies.<sup>90</sup> In a phase II trial of olaparib (AZD2281; AstraZeneca) in metastatic breast cancers in carriers of BRCA mutations, an ORR of 41% was observed with a 400 mg b.i.d. dose.<sup>91</sup>

Basal-like breast cancers often demonstrate what can be termed BRCAness: traits that are shared with those occurring in BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation carriers.<sup>92</sup> For example, BRCA1-related breast cancers are commonly high grade, triple negative, and clustered within the basal-like sporadic cancers according to gene expression profiling. In addition, both sporadic basal-like and BRCA1-related breast cancers have a high rate of TP53 mutation and extreme genomic instability. However, the benefit of PARP inhibitors has not been proven in unselected TNBC populations. In a phase II, multicenter, open-label study of olaparib in patients with recurrent high-grade serous or poorly differentiated ovarian carcinoma or TNBC, none of the 26 breast cancer patients (11 known BRCA mutation carriers and 15 TNBC patients)

without BRCA mutation or with BRCA status unknown) met RECIST response criteria. Another study with an olaparib—paclitaxel combination in TNBC could not achieve acceptable dose intensity because of myelosuppression. Initially considered to be an irreversible PARP inhibitor, iniparib in combination with gemcitabine and carboplatin demonstrated an improvement in median PFS (5.9 versus 3.6 months; \( P = 0.01 \)) and OS (12.3 versus 7.7 months; \( P = 0.01 \)), compared with chemotherapy alone, in a phase II study in patients with metastatic TNBC. However, these results could not be confirmed in the subsequent phase III trial of the same regimen. In addition, it was later discovered that the primary mechanism of action was not via PARP inhibition but by nonselective modification of cysteine-containing proteins. Other PARP inhibitors under investigation include veliparib, rucaparib, and niraparib (MK-4827; Tesaro, Waltham, MA).

### Other Pathways of Interest in TNBC

PI3K pathway activation, likely as a result of loss of negative regulators including PTEN and INPP4B, is frequently observed in TNBC, rendering the PI3K pathway an attractive therapeutic target. Interestingly, a partial response was observed in a patient with TNBC treated in a phase I study of the PI3K inhibitor BKM120. BKM120 is currently being evaluated in phase II trials in patients with metastatic TNBC (NCT01629615 and NCT01790932). In addition, combination strategies of PI3K pathway inhibition with PARP inhibitors (NCT01623349) are being explored in early-phase clinical trials, based on promising preclinical data.

Dasatinib, a potent inhibitor of Src family kinases, was evaluated as a single agent in a phase II study in unselected patients with advanced TNBC. A response rate of 4.7% was observed, indicating an antitumor effect in a limited subset of TNBC. Studies investigating predictive biomarkers of dasatinib and combination strategies of dasatinib with chemotherapy agents are underway. Dinaciclib, which is a potent inhibitor of CDKs 1, 2, 5, and 9, was shown to induce synthetic lethality in MYC-overexpressing TNBC cell lines in preclinical studies. Dinaciclib is currently being evaluated in combination with paclitaxel in an early-phase trial in advanced TNBC (NCT01676753).

In conclusion, there are no established targeted therapies for TNBC, although PARP inhibitors have shown promising activity in BRCA-related cancers. With various agents being evaluated, a common finding has been that of rare responders. Despite more detailed subtype analysis of TNBC by gene expression analysis, predictive signatures for targeted agents are lacking.
