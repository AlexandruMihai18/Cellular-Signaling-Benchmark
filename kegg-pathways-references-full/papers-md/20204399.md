Abstract Mutations in the *CACNA1A* gene that encodes the pore-forming α₁ subunit of human voltage-gated Caᵥ2.1 (P/Q-type) Ca²⁺ channels cause several autosomal-dominant neurologic disorders, including familial hemiplegic migraine type 1 (FHM1), episodic ataxia type 2 (EA2), and spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (SCA6). For each channelopathy, the review describes the disease phenotype as well as the functional consequences of the disease-causing mutations on recombinant human Caᵥ2.1 channels and, in the case of FHM1 and SCA6, on neuronal Caᵥ2.1 channels expressed at the endogenous physiological level in knockin mouse models. The effects of FHM1 mutations on cortical spreading depression, the phenomenon underlying migraine aura, and on cortical excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission in FHM1 knockin mice are also described, and their implications for the disease mechanism discussed. Moreover, the review describes different ataxic spontaneous *cacna1a* mouse mutants and the important insights into the cerebellar mechanisms underlying motor dysfunction caused by mutant Caᵥ2.1 channels that were obtained from their functional characterization.

Introduction

Mutations in the *CACNA1A* gene (chromosome 19p13) that encodes the pore-forming α₁ subunit of human voltage-
gated Caᵥ2.1 (P/Q-type) Ca²⁺ channels cause several neurologic disorders with an autosomal-dominant inheritance pattern, including familial hemiplegic migraine type 1 (FHM1), episodic ataxia type 2 (EA2), and spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (SCA6) [91, 152].

All the 21 FHM1 mutations reported so far (including the Y1385C de novo mutation identified in a sporadic patient without other affected cases in the family) are missense mutations that produce substitutions of conserved amino acids in important functional regions of the Caᵥ2.1 channel including the pore lining and the voltage sensors (for review and references: [100, 124]; for recent novel mutation: [23]). Figure 1a shows their location in the secondary structure of the Caᵥ2.1α₁ subunit, consisting of four repeated domains (I–IV) each of which contains six transmembrane segments (S1–S6) and a pore loop connecting S5 and S6 [14].

FHM1 is a rare autosomal-dominant subtype of migraine with aura of childhood onset. Migraine is a very common episodic headache disorder (cf cumulative lifetime incidence of 43% in women and 18% in men in a recent population study: [121]) that is characterized by recurrent attacks of unilateral headaches, often accompanied by nausea, phonophobia, and photophobia; the headache may be preceded by transient neurological symptoms that are most frequently visual but may involve other senses (migraine with aura, MA). Apart from the motor weakness or hemiparesis during aura, typical FHM1 attacks resemble MA attacks, and both types of attacks may alternate in patients and co-occur within families, suggesting that FHM and MA may be part of the same spectrum and may share some pathogenic mechanisms [100, 101].

The initiation of migraine pain requires the activation of meningeal nociceptive trigeminal sensory afferents; activation of meningeal nociceptors leads to release of vasoactive

neuropeptides at their peripheral nerve terminals and to activation of second-order neurons in the trigeminal nucleus caudalis (TNC), followed by activation of brain structures involved in the processing and perception of pain. The maintenance of the severe prolonged pain of migraine headache involves sensitization of meningeal nociceptors and self-sustained sensitization of central neurons of the trigeminovascular system, whose incompletely understood mechanisms may include alterations of descending endogenous pain modulatory pathways. It is now generally accepted that the primary cause of migraine lies in the brain, but the nature and mechanisms of the primary brain dysfunction that leads to activation of the meningeal trigeminal nociceptors remain incompletely understood and controversial ([17, 34, 72, 101] for reviews). Recent findings point to cortical spreading depression (CSD) as a key player in the pathogenesis of migraine. CSD can be induced in animals by focal stimulation of the cerebral cortex and consists in a slowly propagating wave of strong neuronal and glial depolarisation, whose mechanisms remain unclear [18, 117]. Several lines of evidence, in particular neuroimaging findings, indicate that migraine aura is due to CSD-like events in cerebral sensory cortices. Animal studies support the idea that CSD may also initiate the headache mechanisms, but the connection between CSD and headache in patients (particularly those with migraine without aura) remains an open question ([6, 101] for reviews).

By contrast with common migraine, several FHM1 families show permanent cerebellar symptoms such as slowly progressive cerebellar ataxia and/or nystagmus with cerebellar atrophy in some cases. Pure FHM1 and FHM1 with cerebellar symptoms are usually associated with different mutations. Moreover, in addition to typical attacks, patients of some FHM1 families can have atypical severe attacks with signs of diffuse encephalopathy,

impairment of consciousness (coma) or confusion, fever, prolonged hemiplegia lasting several days, and in a few cases seizures [26, 37]. The incomplete penetrance of FHM1 (only 67% in a recent population-based sample of FHM families: [124]) and the symptom variability among subjects with the same mutation suggests that other genetic or environmental factors also influence the phenotype [26, 37]. Emotional stress and minor head trauma are among the most common triggers of FHM1 attacks [26].

The majority of the more than 50 EA2 mutations in the *CACNA1A* gene reported so far are nonsense or deletions and/or insertions that disrupt the open reading frame leading to truncation of the protein or are intronic mutations that also presumably disrupt the reading frame by exon skipping or intron inclusion of the gene product. However, 21 EA2 mutations do not disrupt the reading frame, including 18 missense mutations resulting in substitutions of conserved amino acids mostly located in the pore regions of the channel (for reviews and references: [49, 50]; for novel recent mutations: [21, 22, 149]; Fig. 1b). Recently, large-scale exonic deletions or duplications in *CACNA1A* have been reported in several EA2 families [71, 108]; the rearrangements are likely to be pathogenic given their segregation with the disease in a large EA2 family.

EA2 is a rare neurological disorder, typically of childhood onset, characterized by paroxysmal attacks (lasting hours to days) of cerebellar dysfunction resulting in ataxic gait, loss of limb coordination, slurred speech, and interictal eye movement abnormalities (nystagmus); the attacks are commonly triggered by emotional and physical stress. Episodes can vary from a pure ataxia to combinations of symptoms: vertigo or dizziness, nausea, and vomiting are among the most common. About half of the patients report migraine headache during the ataxic spells. Interictally, most EA2 patients show a fixed or more often progressive cerebellar syndrome with dysarthria, nystagmus, ataxia, and cerebellar atrophy predominating on the anterior vermis. A severe progressive ataxia in the absence of paroxysmal episodes may be part of the clinical spectrum of the disease. Some EA2 patients can also have learning difficulties or cognitive impairment, dystonia, epileptic (both absence and tonic–clonic) seizures, and diffuse weakness during ataxic spells (and a minority also have episodes of hemiplegia). In general, great intrafamilial and interfamilial variability exists in the symptoms (both episodic and permanent) experienced by EA2 patients, indicating that other genetic or environmental factors strongly influence the phenotype [24, 49, 50]. For the less common symptoms associated with EA2 reported in individual sporadic cases (often with de novo mutations) or in a minority of individuals in EA2 families, the segregation of the mutation with the phenotype could not be established

and the causal relationship of the mutation with the uncommon symptoms remains unclear.

SCA6 is a late-onset slowly progressive ataxic syndrome with marked cerebellar atrophy especially in the superior vermis, characterized by more severe loss of Purkinje than granule cells; it is unique among the channelopathies in that it is caused by small expansions of a polyglutamine (polyQ) sequence, encoded by CAG trinucleotide repeats, at the C-terminal end of some splice variants of Caᵥ2.1 [152]. The splice variants with the polyQ sequence contain the entire exon 47, have a long C terminus, and are predominantly expressed in cerebellar Purkinje cells [46, 107]. SCA6 is unique among the polyQ disorders in that the CAG repeat number is exceptionally low, ranging from 21 to 30, as opposed to over 30 in other polyQ diseases, and cerebellar symptoms predominate, as opposed to more extensive brain involvement in other diseases.

The cerebellum is responsible for coordination of movement and maintenance of balance. At the core of the cerebellar computational circuitry are the Purkinje cells (PCs), the sole output of the cerebellar cortex. It is proposed that coordination of movements is achieved by encoding timing signals (for augmentation and inhibition of the appropriate agonist and antagonist muscles) in the rate of firing and pattern of activity of PCs. PCs integrate time-variant informations from a wealth of sensory and cortical synaptic inputs with their spontaneous intrinsic firing activity; the information is encoded in the firing rate of PCs as transient changes in the frequency of spontaneous activity and relayed to the deep cerebellar nuclei for the final output of the cerebellum ([138] and references therein). In principle, defects in any of these components can result in cerebellar dysfunction and ataxia.

Caᵥ2.1 channels

Caᵥ2.1 channels are located in presynaptic terminals and somatodendritic membranes throughout the mammalian brain and spinal cord [143]. The *CACNA1A* gene undergoes alternative splicing at multiple loci in an age-, gender-, and species-dependent manner ([10, 16, 19, 61, 118] and references therein). This results in multiple Caᵥ2.1 splice variants with different neuronal distribution and subcellular localization, different biophysical properties, and different sensitivity to ω-AgaIVA. Further functional diversity of Caᵥ2.1 channels is generated by a combination of Caᵥ2.1α₁ subunits with different auxiliary β and α₂δ subunits ([77] and references therein). Indeed, there is evidence for large functional and pharmacological diversity of native P/Q-type Ca²⁺ channels [83, 86, 106, 128, 130, 133].
Caᵥ2.1 channels play a prominent role in initiating action-potential-evoked neurotransmitter release at central nervous system synapses [98]. At many central synapses P/Q-, N-, and R-type Ca²⁺ channels cooperate in controlling neurotransmitter release, but P/Q-type channels have a dominant role, partly because of a more efficient coupling to the exocytic machinery [73, 87, 104, 146]. The preferential localization of P/Q channels close to the vesicles at the release sites may account for the more efficient coupling of P/Q channels to release at the Calyx of Held [146] and perhaps at other central synapses; a higher efficacy of activation of P/Q-type Ca²⁺ channels during short action potentials (relative to that of N and R types) may also contribute at other synapses, as shown at mossy fiber boutons [73]. At many central synapses, including the inhibitory synapses between Purkinje cells and deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN) neurons, there is a developmental change in the Ca²⁺ channel types mediating synaptic transmission, whereby the relative contribution of P/Q-type channels to release increases with postnatal age, until release becomes exclusively dependent on P/Q-type channels [48]. Interestingly, this occurs at P12-16, the same age at which the ataxic symptoms begins in knockout Caᵥ2.1⁻/⁻ mice [31, 55].

At the Calyx terminals of Caᵥ2.1⁻/⁻ mice, the lack of P/Q current is partially compensated for by an increased N-type Ca²⁺ current, and there is a shift in reliance of neurotransmission from P/Q- to N-type Ca²⁺ channels [45, 47], a feature common to other central synapses of Caᵥ2.1⁻/⁻ mice [55, 95]. However, N-type channels at Caᵥ2.1⁻/⁻ Calyx terminals appeared located at a greater distance and less effectively coupled to release than P/Q channels at WT synapses [44], suggesting that a specific property of P/Q-type Ca²⁺ channels is the capacity of a particularly tight interaction with the release machinery. This fits with the idea of P/Q-type preferring “slots” for presynaptic Ca²⁺ channels, a fixed number of specific sites of interaction of Ca²⁺ channels and essential binding partners available in limited amount at the release sites that imposes a strict limit in the number of P/Q-type channels that can be functionally coupled to the release machinery [12]. Despite the limited number of P/Q slots, N- and or R-type Ca²⁺ channels cannot completely fill them and thus fail to fully compensate the lack of P/Q channels at certain synapses of Caᵥ2.1⁻/⁻ and other loss-of-function Caᵥ2.1 mouse mutants ([98], and see below).

Among the presynaptic Ca²⁺ channels, Caᵥ2.1 channels are unique also in their capacity of interacting with and being modulated in a complex manner by a number of Ca²⁺-binding proteins ([15] for review and references). As a result, Caᵥ2.1 channels may exhibit both Ca²⁺-dependent inactivation and Ca²⁺-dependent facilitation. Ca²⁺-dependent regulation of presynaptic Caᵥ2.1 channels may play a crucial

role in short-term synaptic plasticity during trains of action potentials [45, 88]. Differential expression of the different Ca²⁺-dependent regulatory proteins and/or of different Caᵥ2.1 splice variants may provide a means of neuron-type-specific regulation of presynaptic P/Q channels and short-term plasticity.

The somatodendritic localization of Caᵥ2.1 channels points to additional postsynaptic roles, e.g., in neural excitability [102, 144], gene expression [122], local Ca²⁺ signaling [30], and cell survival [31].

Caᵥ2.1 channels are expressed in all brain structures that have been implicated in the pathogenesis of migraine and/or migraine pain, including the cerebral cortex, the trigeminal ganglia, and brainstem nuclei involved in the central control of nociception, and their expression is particularly high in the cerebellum ([101] for review and references).

In the cerebral cortex, excitatory synaptic transmission at pyramidal cell synapses in different cortical areas depends predominantly on P/Q-type Ca²⁺ channels [4, 48, 65, 109, 126, 150] with a notable exception at synapses between layer 5 pyramidal cells and burst-firing bipolar interneurons of motor cortex [4]. Activation of the cortex following thalamic stimulation in thalamocortical slices was completely inhibited by blocking P/Q channels [75]. Relatively little is known on the Ca²⁺ channels initiating inhibitory neurotransmission in the cortex, since the Ca²⁺ channel pharmacology has been investigated only at the synapses between fast-spiking (FS) interneurons and pyramidal cells; neurotransmission was found to be exclusively dependent on P/Q-type channels in many cortical areas [70, 126, 150], but again with the exception of layer 5 of the motor cortex, where it was exclusively dependent on N-type channels [4]. An impairment of feedforward inhibition from thalamus to layer 4, probably due to impaired synaptic transmission at FS-pyramidal cell synapses, was revealed in tottering mice carrying a loss-of-function mutation in Caᵥ2.1 [112].

P/Q-type Ca²⁺ channels also mediate about 40% of the AP-evoked Ca²⁺ influx in dendritic spines and shaft of layer 2/3 cortical pyramidal neurons [65] and contribute to the regulation of the intrinsic firing of the same neurons via activation of different Ca²⁺-dependent K⁺ (KCa) channels [102]. In thalamocortical neurons, P/Q channels are essential for the generation of high-frequency subthreshold gamma-band oscillations that are characteristic of the aroused attentive state and considered a functional prerequisite to cognitive states [75].

In the trigeminovascular system, P/Q-type Ca²⁺ channels are involved in the control of release of vasoactive neuropeptides from perivascular terminals of meningeal nociceptors [3, 101] and of glutamate release from trigeminal ganglion neurons in culture [147]. P/Q channels are also
involved in controlling tonic inhibition of TNC neurons with input from the dura [27] and in descending inhibitory and facilitatory pathways that regulate trigeminal and spinal pain transmission [63, 131]. A possible important role of P/Q channels in central sensitization of the trigeminovascular system is suggested by pharmacological evidence in the spinal cord [136] and by the finding of reduced responses to inflammatory and neuropathic pain in Cav2.1−/− mice, carrying a genetic ablation of the Cav2.1α1 subunit that reduces to half the Cav2.1 channels [78]; it is noteworthy that age-matched Cav2.1−/+ mice do not show any motor or other neurological deficit, despite the particularly high expression of Cav2.1 channels in the cerebellum and their key role in cerebellar synaptic transmission and neuron excitability (see below). The analysis of the pain responses in Cav2.1−/− mice revealed a complex role of Cav2.1 channels in pain: a pronociceptive role in inflammatory and neuropathic pain but an antinociceptive role in response to acute noninjurious noxious thermal stimuli [78]; this complex picture likely reflects the prominent role of P/Q channels in controlling release of both excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters and their wide distribution in different regions involved in pain.

In the cerebellum, P/Q-type Ca²⁺ channels play a dominant role in initiating fast transmitter release at the excitatory parallel fiber (PF) and climbing fiber (CF) synapses onto PCs [87] and presumably (but to our knowledge pharmacological studies are lacking) at the excitatory synapses PF–inhibitory interneurons and CF–DCN neurons (Fig. 2a). Inhibitory synaptic transmission at the molecular layer interneurons—PC and PC–PC synapses

[32, 76, 120] and at the inhibitory synapses onto granule cells [76] is almost exclusively dependent on P/Q channels. As mentioned above, inhibitory synaptic transmission at mature synapses between PCs and DCN neurons is exclusively dependent on P/Q-type channels (after P15 in mice) [48] (Fig. 2b).

Moreover, P/Q-type Ca²⁺ channels play a key role in the maintenance of the highly regular, spontaneous pacemaking of PCs because they are specifically coupled to the KCa channels that control the afterhyperpolarization amplitude and the frequency and regularity of tonic firing [144]. After partial block of P/Q Ca²⁺ channels, the spontaneous intrinsic firing of PCs in cerebellar slices becomes irregular and the firing frequency increases [144]; a larger block of P/Q channels causes the cells to burst and then go silent [145]. When high-frequency intrinsic firing is induced in PCs by large depolarizing current injections from hyperpolarized voltages, block of P/Q channels causes rapid adaptation of Na⁺ spikes followed by complete silence; moreover, Ca²⁺-Na⁺ spike bursts are completely inhibited [92].

### Functional consequences of FHM1 mutations on recombinant human Cav2.1 channels

The functional consequences of 13 FHM1 mutations (in red in Fig. 1a) have been investigated in heterologous expression systems expressing recombinant Cav2.1 channels [2, 9, 38, 68, 69, 82, 90, 114, 127, 129, 142] (and our unpublished observations); five of these mutations (under-

In red are the synapses where a dominant role of P/Q-type Ca²⁺ channels in synaptic transmission has been demonstrated or inferred (in red with question mark); the question mark indicates that pharmacological studies on the contribution of P/Q channels are not available. PC Purkinje cell; GC granule cell; DCN deep cerebellar nuclei neuron**
lined in Fig. 1a) have also been investigated in neurons from Caᵥ2.1⁻/⁻ mice expressing human Caᵥ2.1α₁ subunits [12, 13, 127, 129].

The studies in heterologous expression systems show that the FHM1 mutations alter many biophysical properties of human Caᵥ2.1 channels, in a complex way. In some cases, the effects were different depending on the mutation: e.g., the different effects of different FHM1 mutations on the channel inactivation properties resulted in increased, decreased, or unaltered inactivation during train of pulses, depending on the mutation. However, an important consistent effect was revealed by studying the single-channel properties of eight mutant human Caᵥ2.1 channels. All the FHM1 mutants showed an enhanced channel open probability and single channel Ca²⁺ influx (as measured by the product of single-channel current and open probability) in a wide range of depolarizations, mainly due to a shift to lower voltages of channel activation [38, 127, 129] (our unpublished observations; Fig. 3a). Consistent (and significant for the majority of the 13 FHM1 mutations analyzed so far) shifts to lower voltages of activation of the mutant channels were also revealed by measurements of whole-cell currents in heterologous expression systems and transfected

neurons [2, 38, 68, 69, 82, 90, 114, 127, 129, 142]. For certain mutations, the magnitude (or even the presence) of the shift in activation depended on the Caᵥ2.1α₁ splice variant and the type of coexpressed β subunit [2, 90]. The use of different Caᵥ2.1 splice variants and/or β subunits might explain some discrepancies existing in the literature regarding the functional effects of some FHM1 mutations (e.g., the T666M mutation was shown to produce a negative shift of Caᵥ2.1 activation in [127]; in contrast, a lack of effect on activation gating was reported in [9]).

Interestingly, the investigation of the effect of three different FHM1 mutations on the modulation of recombinant human Caᵥ2.1 channels by G proteins revealed a consistent reduction of G-protein-mediated channel inhibition, an effect that may lead to further gain of function of Ca²⁺ influx through mutant channels during neuromodulation [82, 114, 142].

Evidence that FHM1 mutations also affect the density of functional channels in the membrane of cells expressing recombinant human Caᵥ2.1 channels was obtained directly by counting the number of functional channels per patch (divided by the patch area) in cell-attached recordings [38] and/or indirectly by considering the changes in whole-cell

All ipₒ values were divided by the maximal ipₒ value of the WT channel. The values of i and pₒ are taken from [38] for the R192Q mutant and from [129]

SpringerCa²⁺ current density produced by the mutations at high voltages (where the open probability of Cav2.1 channels is maximal and similar for mutant and WT channels) [127, 129] or by measuring gating currents [9]. When the mutant channels were expressed in HEK293 cells, a decreased density of functional channels and a consequent decreased maximal whole-cell Ca²⁺ current density were found for most FHM1 mutants compared to WT [9, 38, 127, 129], with some notable exceptions: e.g., the density of functional channels carrying the R192Q mutation was increased rather than decreased [38]. When the same mutant channels were expressed in Cav2.1⁻/⁻ neurons, a consistent decrease in maximal whole-cell P/Q Ca²⁺ current density was found for all the five FHM1 (including R192Q) mutants investigated; at low voltages, Cav2.1 current densities were similar to, or in the case of the S218L mutation larger than WT because of the negatively shifted activation of the FHM1 mutants [12, 13, 127, 129] (Fig. 3b).

Investigation of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission in cultured Cav2.1⁻/⁻ hippocampal neurons transfected with WT or mutant Cav2.1 channels revealed an unaltered overall synaptic strength but a decreased contribution of P/Q channels to neurotransmission that correlated with the decreased maximal P/Q current density at the soma [12, 13]; synapses expressing mutant channels were more susceptible to G-protein-coupled neuromodulation by the GABAB agonist baclofen, presumably as a consequence of the larger contribution of N-type Ca²⁺ channels to neurotransmission [13]. On the basis of this and the finding that the contribution of P/Q channels to neurotransmission was reduced also by overexpression of FHM1 mutants in WT neurons, Cao et al. [12, 13] suggested loss of function of human Cav2.1 channels and weakened neurotransmission as the basis for FHM1 pathogenesis. This hypothesis was in conflict with the consistent increase in open probability and single-channel Ca²⁺ influx of mutant human Cav2.1 channels revealed by single-channel recordings that suggested gain of function of human Cav2.1 channels and enhanced neurotransmission as the basis for FHM1 pathogenesis [127, 129]. This controversy has been recently solved by the generation and functional characterization of two different FHM1 knockin mouse models [134, 135].

particularly dramatic clinical syndrome that may consist of, in addition to attacks of hemiplegic migraine, slowly progressive cerebellar ataxia and atrophy, epileptic seizures, coma or profound stupor, and severe, sometimes fatal, cerebral edema which can be triggered by only a trivial head trauma [67, 135]. Whereas homozygous R192Q (RQ/RQ) and heterozygous S218L (SL/WT) KI mice did not exhibit an overt phenotype, homozygous S218L (SL/SL) mice exhibited mild permanent cerebellar ataxia, spontaneous attacks of hemiparesis and/or (sometimes fatal) generalized seizures, and brain edema after only a mild head impact, thus modeling the main features of the severe S218L clinical syndrome [134, 135].

In cerebellar granule cells and cortical pyramidal cells of R192Q and S218L KI mice, the P/Q-type Ca²⁺ current density was larger than in WT neurons in a wide range of relatively mild depolarizations, reflecting activation of mutant mouse Cav2.1 channels at 8–9 mV more negative voltages than the corresponding WT channels; P/Q current densities were similar in KI and WT neurons at higher voltages (that elicit maximal Cav2.1 channel open probability), indicating similar densities of functional Cav2.1 channels [126, 134, 135] (Fig. 3c). Thus, in two different FHM1 mouse models and two different types of neurons (expressing different Cav2.1 channels, as shown by the different Cav2.1 activation properties in WT cerebellar and cortical neurons: [126]) the functional consequences of the FHM1 mutations on native neuronal mouse Cav2.1 channels were quite similar to those on single recombinant human Cav2.1 channels [127, 129] (Fig. 3). In agreement with the lower threshold of activation of human S218L Cav2.1 channels compared to that of human R192Q Cav2.1 channels [129], the gain of function of the P/Q current at low voltages was larger in S218L than R192Q KI mice [134, 135]. The shift to lower voltages of Cav2.1 channel activation and the gain of function of the neuronal Cav2.1 current were about twice as large in homozygous compared to heterozygous KI mice, revealing an allele-dosage effect consistent with the dominance of the mutation in FHM1 patients [135]. The densities of the other Ca²⁺ current components (L, N, and R types) were similar in KI and WT neurons, indicating the absence of compensatory changes in the other Ca²⁺ channel types [126, 134, 135].

The first indication that the gain of function of Cav2.1 channels produced by FHM1 mutations could lead to enhanced evoked neurotransmitter release was obtained by investigating neurotransmission at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ); evoked neurotransmission was unaltered at physiological Ca²⁺ ion concentrations but increased at 0.2 mM Ca²⁺ in KI mice [57, 134, 135]. Recently, cortical excitatory neurotransmission was investigated in neuronal microcultures and, in the context of functional neuronal circuits, in brain slices from homozygous R192Q KI mice

# FHM1 knockin mouse models

The generation of knockin mice (KI) carrying two different FHM1 mutations (R192Q and S218L; Fig. 4) allowed the first analysis of the functional consequences of FHM1 mutations on Cav2.1 channels and synaptic transmission in neurons expressing the channels at the endogenous physiological level [126, 134, 135]. Whereas mutation R192Q causes in humans pure FHM, mutation S218L causes a

[126]. The results show increased synaptic strength at physiological Ca²⁺ concentration, due to enhanced action-potential-evoked Ca²⁺ influx through mutant synaptic P/Q Ca²⁺ channels and enhanced probability of glutamate release at cortical pyramidal cell synapses. Short-term synaptic depression during trains of action potentials was enhanced. Neither amplitude nor frequency of miniature postsynaptic current were altered, indicating the absence of homeostatic compensatory mechanisms at excitatory synapses onto pyramidal cells [126].

The different findings in neurons overexpressing mutant human Cav2.1 channels [12] can be explained if one hypothesizes that the decreased density of functional mutant channels in the membrane of transfected neurons [127, 129] is due to the presence of a fraction of completely nonfunctional mutant Cav2.1 channels, probably consequent to overexpression; these nonfunctional mutant channels are not present in neurons of KI mice expressing the channels at their native physiological level (cf unaltered density of functional channels in the membrane of cortical and cerebellar neurons in [126, 134, 135]). In this hypothesis, the nonfunctional mutant channels would compete with the functional (gain-of-function FHM1 mutant or WT) channels for the limited number of presynaptic Ca²⁺ channel slots, thus explaining the decreased contribution of P/Q channels to neurotransmission upon overexpression of mutant channels in both Cav2.1⁻/⁻ and WT neurons [12].

The investigation of experimental CSD, elicited either by electrical stimulation of the cortex in vivo or high KCl in cortical slices, revealed a lower threshold for CSD induction and an increased velocity of CSD propagation in R192Q and S218L KI mice [126, 134, 135]. Moreover, a single CSD, elicited by brief epidural application of high KCl, produced more severe and prolonged motor deficits (including hemiplegia) in FHM1 KI mice, and, in contrast with WT mice, CSD readily propagated into the striatum [29]. In agreement with the higher incidence of migraine in females, the velocity of propagation and the frequency of CSDs, elicited by continuous epidural high KCl application, were larger in females than in males of both mutant strains; the sex difference was abrogated by ovariectomy and enhanced by orchiectomy, suggesting that female and male gonadal hormones exert reciprocal effects on CSD susceptibility [28, 29].

In correlation with the more severe S218L clinical phenotype and the larger gain of function of the neuronal P/Q Ca²⁺ current, the facilitation of both induction and propagation of CSD was larger [135] and the post-CSD neurological motor deficits were more severe [29] in S218L than in R192Q KI mice in vivo. Generalized seizures after a single CSD were observed in SL/SL, but not in RQ/RQ or SL/WT KI mice [29]. Moreover, S218L KI mice showed a unique increased susceptibility to repetitive successive CSD events following a single CSD-inducing stimulus: multiple CSDs after a threshold stimulation were observed in more than 70% of SL/SL and 50% of SL/WT KI mice, but only in 10–20% of WT and RQ/RQ KI mice (despite the much lower intensity of the threshold stimulation in SL/SL and the similar threshold in SL/WT and RQ/RQ KI mice) [135]. Although the exact mechanism of this unique increased propensity to recurrent CSDs remains to be determined, the findings of van den Maagdenberg et al. [135] suggest that the high sensitivity of the S218L brain to even mild stimuli (e.g., low-impact head trauma) may be explained, at least in part, by the unique combination of a particularly low CSD trigger threshold and a high propensity for multiple CSD events.

As a whole, the studies of experimental CSD in FHM1 KI mice strengthen the view of CSD as a key player in the pathogenesis of migraine. Moreover, together with the previous study of Ayata et al. [7] that revealed an increased threshold for initiation and a decreased velocity of propagation of experimental CSD in the spontaneous mouse mutants leaner and tottering with loss-of-function mutations in cacna1a ([97] and see below), the studies of
CSD in FHM1 KI mice support a key role of Caᵥ2.1 channels in the initiation and propagation of CSD.

Tottene et al. [126] provided direct evidence that the gain of function of glutamate release at synapses onto pyramidal cells may explain the facilitation of experimental CSD in FHM1 mutant mice. In fact, the facilitation of induction and propagation of experimental CSD observed in acute slices of somatosensory cortex of R192Q KI mice was completely eliminated (both CSD threshold and velocity became similar to those in WT slices) when glutamate release at pyramidal cell synapses was brought back to WT values using a subsaturating concentration of the P/Q channel blocker ω-AgaIVA.

This finding gives insight into the controversial mechanisms of CSD initiation and propagation. The initiation of the positive feedback cycle that ignites CSD and almost zeroes the neuronal membrane potential depends crucially on the local increase of the extracellular concentration of K⁺ ions above a critical value and on the activation of a net inward current at the apical pyramidal cell dendrites; the nature of the cationic channels mediating this inward current remains unclear and controversial, although there is strong pharmacological support for a key role of NMDA receptors; another controversial issue is the mechanism of CSD propagation ([18, 117, 126] and references therein). The findings of Tottene et al. [126] support a model of CSD initiation in which activation of presynaptic P/Q-type Ca²⁺ channels with consequent release of glutamate from recurrent cortical pyramidal cell synapses and activation of NMDA receptors (and possibly postsynaptic P/Q-type Ca²⁺ channels) are key components of the positive feedback cycle that ignites CSD [99]. Regarding CSD propagation, the findings are consistent with a model based on interstitial K⁺ diffusion initiating in adjacent dendrites this positive feedback cycle.

In migraineurs, CSD is not induced by experimental depolarizing stimuli but arises “spontaneously” in response to specific triggers that somehow create in the cortex of migraineurs the conditions for initiation of the positive feedback cycle that overwhelms the regulatory mechanisms controlling cortical \[K⁺\]₀ and ignites CSD. Insights into how this might occur have been provided by the interesting finding that, in contrast with the gain of function of excitatory neurotransmission, inhibitory neurotransmission at synapses between FS interneurons and pyramidal cells was not altered in R192Q KI mice, despite being initiated by P/Q Ca²⁺ channels [126]. A possible explanation for this unexpected finding is the presence of a Caᵥ2.1 isoform that is little affected by the mutation at FS interneuron synapses; alternative explanations may be near saturation of the presynaptic Ca²⁺ sensor and/or a minor effect of the FHM1 mutation on action-potential-evoked Ca²⁺ influx due to the very short action potential of FS interneurons.

The demonstration that FHM1 mutations may differently affect synaptic transmission and short-term synaptic plasticity at different cortical synapses suggests that the neuronal circuits that coordinate and dynamically adjust the balance between excitation and inhibition during cortical activity [116] are very likely altered in FHM1. It appears reasonable to hypothesize that, as a consequence, in certain conditions (cf migraine triggers) the cortical excitation–inhibition balance may be disrupted due to excessive recurrent excitation, resulting in overexcitation and neuronal hyperactivity that may increase \[K⁺\]₀ above the critical value for CSD ignition. The studies in FHM1 mice support the view of migraine as an episodic disorder of brain excitability with episodic disruptions of the excitation–inhibition balance and hyperactivity of cortical circuits in response to migraine triggers as the basis for vulnerability to CSD ignition.

### Functional consequences of EA2 mutations on recombinant human Caᵥ2.1 channels

The functional consequences of nine EA2 mutations not disrupting the reading frame (including seven missense mutations) on recombinant human Caᵥ2.1 channels have been investigated by expressing the channels in either mammalian cells or oocytes (Fig. 1b). When the mutant channels were expressed in mammalian cells, complete or almost complete loss of function of human Caᵥ2.1 channels was found [36, 51, 53, 84, 119, 139]. Interestingly, the loss of function of mutant channels was partially rescued if the cells were incubated for 2–3 days at 26–30°C [139, 140], suggesting that the mutant channels were misfolded and inefficiently trafficked to the plasma membrane. Indeed, the membrane expression of tagged EA2 mutants (three missense and four truncations) was absent or lower and there was evidence of accumulation of the mutants in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) [53, 84, 139] and of ER-associated degradation of the mutants by the proteasome [84].

A clear dominant negative effect of EA2 mutants was revealed by coexpression of several EA2 missense and truncation mutants with WT human Caᵥ2.1 channels in mammalian cells [53, 84, 105]. The coexpression led to ER retention and reduction of membrane expression of the WT Caᵥ2.1 channel, resulting in a reduced Ca²⁺ current [53, 84]; both the impaired localization and reduced Ca²⁺ current were rescued if the cells were incubated for a few days at 27°C [53]. Mezghrani et al. [84] found that the EA2 mutants also induced a downregulation of total Caᵥ2.1 expression (but cf [53, 105] for different findings) and, with pulse-chase experiments, provided evidence that the down-regulation of WT Caᵥ2.1 was due to proteasome-dependent
increased protein degradation, which could be consequent to direct interaction between mutant and WT channel. The data are consistent with the conclusion that the dominant negative effect of EA2 mutants is due to misfolding-induced ER-associated degradation of WT Caᵥ2.1 channels that is promoted by direct interaction of misfolded mutant channels with their WT counterparts [84]. Translation inhibition mediated by a component of the unfolded protein response may also contribute to the dominant negative effect of EA2 mutants [93].

In contrast with the findings in mammalian cells, the presence of the dominant negative effect seems to be strictly dependent on the type of Caᵥ2.1 splice variant carrying the mutation when the EA2 mutants are expressed in oocytes. In fact, a dominant negative effect of several missense and truncation mutants was found when the EA2 mutations were inserted in certain Caᵥ2.1 isoforms, including a human Caᵥ2.1 with a long C terminus [52, 54, 93], but not when they were inserted in a human Caᵥ2.1 with a short C terminus [35, 42, 43, 52, 140]. Moreover, oocytes expressing short human Caᵥ2.1 channels carrying four different EA2 mutations, including two mutations that in mammalian cells led to complete loss of function of the channel [139, 140], displayed a measurable (although strongly reduced) Ca²⁺ current [42, 43, 140]. Differences in the ER retention and cellular degradative capacities between oocytes and mammalian cells likely explain the different loss-of-function and dominant negative effects of EA2 mutants in the two expression systems.

Interestingly, in the cases and conditions in which the EA2 mutations did not lead to complete loss of function of the channels, the activation curve of human Caᵥ2.1 channels (with six different EA2 mutations) was consistently shifted to more depolarized voltages [42, 43, 119, 139, 140], suggesting a reduced open probability of mutant Caᵥ2.1 channels, as indeed shown for the G293R mutant [140]. Thus, FHM1 and EA2 mutations have opposite effects on the voltage dependence of activation and the open probability of human Caᵥ2.1 channels, leading to increased and decreased Ca²⁺ influx through human FHM1 and EA2 Caᵥ2.1 channels, respectively.

Regarding the implications of these findings for the pathogenesis of EA2, a very important critical issue that remains unanswered is whether the aberrant trafficking and the dominant negative effects of EA2 mutants demonstrated in the heterologous expression systems also exist in neurons, and if they do, to what extent they reduce the density of Ca²⁺ channels in specific membrane compartments (e.g., at the active zones) and to what extent these effects are Caᵥ2.1 splice variant dependent. If occurring in neurons, the dominant negative effects of the mutant channels would provide a “gain-of-function” mechanism as to why the disease is dominant

(rather than being attributed solely to haploinsufficiency). Additional mechanisms may contribute to make EA2 dominant, if in neurons at least a fraction of mutant channels is targeted to the membrane: the EA2 mutant channels may compete with WT channels for the limited number of presynaptic Ca²⁺ channel slots [12] or, in general, for the limited pool of regulatory proteins with which Caᵥ2.1 channels interact, thus leading to reduced Caᵥ2.1-dependent functions.

To answer these questions, it appears crucial to investigate mutant Caᵥ2.1 channels expressed at their endogenous physiological level in cerebellar neurons and synapses of EA2 knockin mouse models; unfortunately, these mice are not available. However, there are Caᵥ2.1⁻/⁻ knockout mice [31, 55, 56] and several spontaneous mouse mutants that show progressive cerebellar ataxia and harbor mutations in the cacnala gene leading to reduced P/Q-type Ca²⁺ current density in cerebellar PCs [85, 97, 98, 103]. While it is questionable whether these mice are good models of EA2 (see below), there is evidence that one of the spontaneous mutations (rolling Nagoya) has different functional consequences in mouse PC neurons (that show unaltered Ca²⁺ current density at high voltages) and in mammalian cells overexpressing mutant recombinant channels (that show strongly reduced Ca²⁺ current density) [89]. These findings indicate that in PC neurons of rolling mice the expression and/or targeting of mutant Caᵥ2.1 channels is unaltered, in contrast with their reduced expression and/or targeting in the heterologous expression system.

Caᵥ2.1⁻/⁻ mice and spontaneous mouse mutants with loss-of-function mutations in the cacnala gene: EA2 mouse models?

Five spontaneous mouse mutants harboring loss-of-function mutations in the cacnala gene that lead to reduced P/Q-type Ca²⁺ current density in cerebellar PCs have been described: tottering (tg), leaner (la), rolling Nagoya (rol), rocker (rkr), and tottering-4j (tg-4j); in addition, Caᵥ2.1⁻/⁻ mice lacking P/Q-type currents have been generated ([97, 98, 103] for reviews and references; [85]). Four of the spontaneous cacnala mutations are missense, leading to substitutions of conserved amino acids in the pore lining or voltage sensor regions of Caᵥ2.1; the leaner phenotype is caused by a splice-site mutation producing two aberrant splice products with altered C-terminal sequences (Fig. 4). All homozygous mice show progressive ataxia, ranging from mild in rkr/rkr, tg/tg, and tg-4j/tg4j to severe ataxia and dystonia in la/la and Caᵥ2.1⁻/⁻ mice. tg/tg, tg-4j/tg-4j, and rkr/rkr mice also show stress-induced attacks of dyskinesia, a form of dystonia involving specific muscles (phenotypically similar to human paroxysmal dyskinesias);
these attacks are considered to be due to cerebellar dysfunction, like ataxia, albeit through distinct underlying mechanisms [1, 11]. With the exception of rol/rol mice, all the other homozygous cacnala mutants show absence seizures, characterized by 3–5 Hz cortical spike-wave discharges recorded by EEG, associated with behavioral immobility.

Heterozygous Cav2.1⁻/⁺ mice as well as the heterozygous spontaneous mouse mutants do not show any neurological phenotype at 2 months of age. However, normal basal performance but impaired motor learning in the vestibulo-ocular reflex have been recently reported in heterozygous la/+ and Cav2.1⁻/⁺ mice at 3–5 months of age [62] and clear deficits in motor coordination and/or motor learning have been reported in aged (1–2 years old) heterozygous la/+ and rol/+ mice [5, 123].

Cav2.1⁻/⁻ and la/la mice at 4 months of age show selective degeneration of the cerebellum in a specific pattern, with extensive loss of PCs in parasagittal stripes and graded loss of granule cells (GCs) more severe in the anterior lobe. Interestingly, cerebellar atrophy in EA2 and SCA6 patients also predominates in the anterior lobe [97]. At 4 months of age, the mildly ataxic mice do not show cerebellar degeneration, while apoptotic death of GCs in the anterior lobe has been reported in rol/rol mice. Recently, clear loss of PCs in parasagittal stripes has been reported in 1-year-old tg/tg mice [113], indicating that onset of PC degeneration is delayed in tg/tg mice with mild ataxia compared to the severe la/la and Cav2.1⁻/⁻ mice but has otherwise a similar specific pattern. The analysis of the Ca²⁺ current components of cerebellar PCs and GCs (whose loss begins earlier than that of PCs) in the Cav2.1 mouse mutants suggests that survival of cerebellar neurons depends specifically on a critical level of P/Q-type Ca²⁺ channel function that cannot be compensated for by other Ca²⁺ channel types [31, 97]. The Cav2.1⁻/⁻ mice, with 50% reduced P/Q current in GCs, and all the spontaneous mouse mutants (rkr/rkr, tg/tg, tg4j/tg4j, rol/rol), with less than 50% reduction of P/Q current in PCs, do not show PC death at 4 months, whereas la/la mice with about 70% reduction of P/Q current in PCs show cerebellar degeneration similar to Cav2.1⁻/⁻ mice [64, 85, 97]. A cerebellar phenotype similar to that of la/la and Cav2.1⁻/⁻ mice (including death of GCs and PCs) has been recently reported for Cav2.1 knockdown mice with 30% of the WT Cav2.1 level, whereas mice with 60 and 55% of the WT Cav2.1 level were normal [111]. It remains unknown why, when reduction of P/Q channel function exceeds the critical threshold, neuronal death in the cerebellum is not homogeneous and occurs in a highly specific pattern.

At the ultrastructural level, ectopic spines and axonal swellings are present in PCs of all the loss-of-function allelic mouse mutants, with the exception of rkr/rkr (the mutant with the smaller reduction in P/Q current density in PCs), which however, like the other mutants, show undersized PC dendrites [64, 85, 97]. Moreover, Cav2.1⁻/⁻, la/la, rol/rol, and tg/tg mice show a reorganization of PF–PC synapses consisting in enlarged PF varicosities synapsing on several PC dendritic spines, in addition to the common monosynaptic contacts. Cav2.1⁻/⁻ mice also show persistence of somatic innervation by climbing fibers and persistence of multiple CF innervation on the same PC neuron. Abnormal gene expression appears widespread in the brain of these mouse mutants ([97, 98, 103] for reviews and references).

Although the loss-of-function Cav2.1 mouse mutants are often considered as EA2 mouse models, there are several important differences between the mouse and human EA2 phenotypes. First, EA2 patients have only one defective copy of the CACNA1A gene; in contrast, heterozygous mice are often minimally symptomatic (but cf clear motor deficits in some aged mutants). Second, EA2 patients suffer from intermittent spells of ataxia that may or may not be accompanied by progressive ataxia; in contrast, the mice show continuous progressive ataxia symptoms (although one should consider that probably it would be difficult to ascertain a mild and intermittent ataxia in mice). Third, most EA2 mutations lead to complete loss of function of human Cav2.1 channels expressed in mammalian cell lines; in contrast, a 50–70% reduced [89, 137] or even an unchanged [85] maximal Ca²⁺ current density has been reported in mammalian cells expressing Cav2.1 channels with the mouse mutations. The reduction of the maximal P/Q-type Ca²⁺ current density in PC neurons of homozygous mouse mutants ranges from 15% to 80% (depending on genotype, age and/or laboratory) [85, 97]. Interestingly, like the EA2 mutations, the mouse mutations (with the exception of tottering and rocker) shift the activation of Cav2.1 channels to more depolarized voltages, thus leading to a larger reduction of the P/Q current with relatively mild depolarizations. The higher activation threshold and the lower open probability of mutant channels likely entirely account for the reduced P/Q-type current in PCs of rol/rol and tg-4j/tg-4j mice, whereas in the case of tg/tg and rkr/rkr mice the relatively small reduction of P/Q-type current is likely due to a decreased expression of functional channels in the membrane (but another untested possibility is a homogeneous reduction of the channel open probability at all voltages). Thus, the mouse mutations do not seem to produce Cav2.1 trafficking-expression defects (and likely dominant negative effects) comparable to those induced by EA2 mutations, which is in agreement with the lack of or very mild phenotype of heterozygous mice.

Even though the available loss-of-function Cav2.1 mouse mutants might not be accurate animal models ofEA2, they have provided important insights into the cerebellar mechanisms that may underlie motor dysfunction caused by mutations in Cav2.1 channels.

Recordings of simple spike and complex spike activity of floccular PCs at rest and during optokinetic stimulation in $tg/tg$ mice in vivo revealed a greater irregularity of the simple spike firing pattern compared to WT, both at rest and during compensatory eye movements [41]. Floccular output was functionally absent in the mutants. The data of Hoebeek et al. [41] are consistent with the idea that the regularity of PC firing influences sensorimotor processing and that irregular simple spike activities contribute to the deficits in oculomotor performance in $tg/tg$ mice. To the extent that the function of the flocculus in eye movement parallels the role of extrafloccular cerebellum in limb and trunk motor control, irregular PC firing activities might also make a significant contribution to the ataxia found in $cacnala$ mouse mutants and in human $CACNA1A$ disorders. Consistent with and supporting this idea is the finding that the motor performance of $tg/tg$ mice on the rotarod was improved after in vivo chronic perfusion in the cerebellum of EBIO, an activator of the $K_{Ca}$ channel SK, that was shown to decrease the irregularity of spontaneous PC firing induced in cerebellar slices by partial block of P/Q channels [138]. In the same study, an allele-dosage-dependent reduction in the regularity of the spontaneous intrinsic firing activity of PCs in cerebellar slices (at 35°C) was revealed in both leaner and ducky ($du$) mice, without alteration of the average firing rate [138]. $Du/du$ mice are ataxic and have a 35% reduction of the P/Q $Ca^{2+}$ current in PCs as a consequence of a mutation in the $Cacna2d2$ gene, encoding a $Ca^{2+}$ channel auxiliary $\alpha_2\delta_2$ subunit mainly expressed in PCs; the mutation leads to truncation of the protein and duplication of other genes [8]. EBIO restored the regularity of the spontaneous firing of PCs in cerebellar slices of $du/+ $ mice and improved their performance on the rotarod (even though $du/+ $ mice did not show a clear motor deficit) [138]. The data of Walter et al. [138] suggest that alterations in intrinsic firing make a significant contribution to the irregularity of PC activities and the loss of transfer of synaptic information from PCs to DCN neurons measured in vivo in $tg/tg$ mice.

However, different findings were obtained in another study analyzing spontaneous intrinsic firing of PCs in cerebellar slices of $du2j/du2j$ mice (with a mutation that should lead to a clean knockout of the $\alpha_2\delta_2$ subunit); a reduced regularity of intrinsic pacemaking of PCs (with reduced average firing frequency) was found at 22°C, but not at 34°C [25]. At the more physiological temperature, PCs of $du2j/du2j$ mice were silent, probably as a consequence of depolarization block of $Na^+$ channels, and PCs of $du2j/+ $ mice fired at a lower frequency and with similar

regularity as WT cells. Inhibition of $Ca^{2+}-Na^+$ spike bursts and rapid adaptation of $Na^+$ spikes followed by complete silence upon strong depolarizing current injections from hyperpolarized voltages were observed in PCs of $du2j/du2j$, $rol/rol$, and $la/la$ mice [25, 89, 92]. A reduced spontaneous activity of PCs is expected to cause disinhibition of DCN neurons and, as a consequence, ataxia; in fact, hyperexcitability of DCN neurons per se may produce ataxia [115]. Interestingly, in vivo recording of spontaneous activity of DCN neurons receiving PC input revealed a more irregular firing and an increased firing frequency in $tg/tg$ compared to WT mice [40].

The changes in spontaneous intrinsic firing of PCs in the loss-of-function Cav2.1 mouse mutants are consistent with reduced $Ca^{2+}$ entry through P/Q-type channels and reduced activation of $K_{Ca}$ channels but are not exactly identical to those obtained upon pharmacological partial block of P/Q channels, particularly in the case of $du2j/du2j$ mice. Secondary compensatory changes likely contribute to the alterations in intrinsic pacemaking in the mutant mice. Indeed, at least 23 genes showed consistently altered expression in $du2j/du2j$ mice [25]. Moreover, the minimal current required to initiate repetitive firing was smaller in $la/la$ mice compared to WT even after pharmacological block of P/Q channels, suggesting the presence of secondary changes that make leaner's PCs hyperexcitable [92]. Indeed, mutant PCs showed a higher input resistance ($R_{in}$), which may be explained at least in part by their reduced cell size mainly due to undersized dendrites. A higher $R_{in}$ may contribute to degrade the firing precision of PCs by converting subthreshold synaptic noise into signal, thus reducing the signal-to-noise ratio [92].

The motor deficits in the different loss-of-function Cav2.1 mouse mutants do not correlate in a simple manner with the reduction of P/Q-type $Ca^{2+}$ current in Purkinje cells; in fact, a 50% reduction of P/Q current in Cav2.1$^{-/-}$ mice does not cause ataxia, whereas a lower reduction in $tg/tg$, $tg4j/tg4j$, $du/du$, and $rkr/rkr$ (with no alterations in biophysical properties of the current) is associated with ataxia. Given the prominent role of P/Q channels in both excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission at cerebellar synapses (Fig. 2), one expects that alterations of synaptic transmission likely contribute to the alterations in frequency and pattern of firing of PCs and to the motor deficits in $cacnala$ mutants.

Investigation of neurotransmission at PF–PC synapses in several $cacnala$ mouse mutants ($rkr/rkr$, $tg/tg$, $rol/rol$, and $la/la$) at the age of development of their ataxic symptoms revealed a strong reduction of the excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) amplitudes evoked by PF stimulations at different intensities [64, 74, 80]. Paired pulse facilitation (PPF) was increased in $rol/rol$ and $la/la$ mice [74, 80],suggesting that the decreased EPSC amplitude reflected reduced glutamate release at PF synapses, consequent to reduced AP-evoked Ca²⁺ influx at the active zones (as expected from the activation of rol and la mutant Cav2.1 channels at more depolarized voltages compared to WT, the opposite phenotype of FHM1 mutants). As already mentioned, activation at more depolarized voltages than WT channels is also a consistent property of EA2 mutant human Cav2.1 channels.

In contrast, PPF was not altered at PF–PC synapses in tg/tg and rkr/rkr mice, suggesting unaltered evoked glutamate release; indeed, good evidence for unaltered AP-evoked Ca²⁺ influx at the active zones and unaltered glutamate concentration at the synaptic cleft was obtained in rkr/rkr mice [64]. At the active zones, the reduced number of P/Q channels is likely compensated for by other Ca²⁺ channels, as indicated by the relatively larger contribution of N- (and also R-)type Ca²⁺ channels to the PF–EPSC in tg/tg mice [80]. Interestingly, the number and density of postsynaptic AMPA receptors were substantially decreased at PF–PC synapses of rkr/rkr mice; this surprising postsynaptic alteration likely accounts for the reduced PF–EPSC amplitude and point to a specific postsynaptic role of Cav2.1 channels in determining the synaptic content of AMPA receptors at PF–PC synapses [64]. It remains to be seen whether the reduction of postsynaptic AMPA receptors also occurs in the other loss-of-function cacnala mutants (in particular in tg) and entirely or partially account for the reduced EPSC at their PF–PC synapses.

The analysis of the impact of the reduced PF–EPSC amplitudes on excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) in la/la mice provided another unexpected interesting finding: PF stimulation elicited EPSPs of similar amplitude in mutant and WT mice [74]. The higher R<sub>in</sub> of PCs in la/la mice [92] may at least partly account for the finding. Unaltered field EPSP amplitudes evoked by PF stimulation were also reported in tg/tg mice [151]. It will be interesting to see if both the higher R<sub>in</sub> and the unaltered PF–EPSPs are also found in the other loss-of-function cacnala mutants.

At the other major cerebellar excitatory synapse onto PCs, glutamate release evoked by CF stimulation was unaltered in both tg/tg and rol/rol mutants [80]. Saturation of the EPSC down to 1 mM external [Ca²⁺] at WT CF–PC synapses suggests that a saturated presynaptic Ca²⁺ sensor may contribute to explain the unaltered release; a compensatory increase of N- (and R-)type Ca²⁺ channels at the release sites (and perhaps other compensatory mechanisms) may also contribute [80]. The amplitude of the CF–EPSC was unaltered in tg/tg and increased in rol/rol and la/la mice, pointing to alterations in postsynaptic AMPA receptors as secondary effects of the mutations [74, 80].

However, despite the larger CF–EPSCs, the complex spikes evoked in la/la PCs by CF stimulation were similar to those observed in WT cells [74].

As a whole, the findings at the excitatory PF–PC and CF–PC synapses suggest that alterations of excitatory neurotransmission onto PCs may not make a significant contribution to the alterations in frequency and pattern of firing of PCs and to the motor deficits of the loss-of-function cacnala mutants. However, altered neuromodulation of excitatory transmission might play an important role. Indeed, both baclofen and noradrenaline (via activation of GABA<sub>B</sub> and α₂ adrenergic receptors) were more potent in inhibiting synaptic transmission at PF–PC synapses of tg/tg mice, partly as a consequence of the relatively larger contribution of N-type Ca²⁺ channels to neurotransmission compared to WT [151]. Stimulation of stellate interneurons produced a GABA<sub>B</sub>-mediated presynaptic inhibition of glutamatergic transmission at PF–PC synapses that lasted much longer in tg/tg than WT mice [151]. A change in the balance between synaptic excitation and inhibition was suggested to contribute to the ataxia phenotype.

Unfortunately, it remains unknown how inhibitory synaptic transmission in the cerebellar cortex is affected in these cacnala mouse mutants. This is an important piece of information that is missing, given the evidence that the highly regular firing pattern of PCs observed in the absence of synaptic inputs is transformed into an irregular firing pattern by activity in the population of inhibitory neurons [39]. Interestingly, a marked reduction in the frequency of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents in PCs has been recently revealed in organotypic cerebellar slice cultures from Cav2.1<sup>−/−</sup> mice [76].

As a whole, the available data from the loss-of-function cacnala mutants are consistent with the hypothesis that under physiological conditions in the ataxic mice the inhibition imposed by the PC neurons onto the cerebellar nuclei is less effective and less consistent, either because of decreased spiking regularity and firing synchronicity between PCs converging onto DCN neurons or because of decreased PC activity.

Given the key role of Cav2.1 channels in the maintenance of the highly regular intrinsic pacemaking of PCs as well as in both excitatory and inhibitory cerebellar synaptic transmission (Fig. 2), it is not difficult to envision that irregular PC firing activities and consequent decreased synchronicity between PCs converging onto DCN neurons may be produced also by gain-of-function mutations in Cav2.1 channels. Indeed, many FHM1 mutations also cause progressive cerebellar ataxia. Moreover, two spontaneous dominant cacnala mouse mutants, wobbly and tottering-5j, that show ataxia in heterozygosis have been described [85, 148] (Fig. 4), and the tottering-5j mutation,as the FHM1 mutations, produced a shift to lower voltages of activation of Caᵥ2.1 channels [85].

As mentioned in the previous section, some EA2 patients show diffuse weakness during ataxic spells; in three of these patients, abnormal neuromuscular transmission has been demonstrated using single-fiber electromyography [51]. In vitro studies on muscle biopsies from the two patients with truncation mutations revealed a reduced amplitude and quantal content of the endplate potential (EPP) elicited by nerve stimulation and reduced or zeroed EPP depression during 20-Hz stimulation, suggesting impaired neurotransmission mainly due to reduced probability of acetylcholine release [79]. While in controls the initiation of neuromuscular transmission was exclusively mediated by P/Q-type channels, a significant contribution of N-type channels was revealed in the two EA2 patients; in one patient, the frequency of mEPPs was increased [79]. These findings reveal the presence of compensatory mechanisms at the EA2 NMJs, either at the level of AP-evoked Ca²⁺ influx at the active zones (cf upregulation of N-type Ca²⁺ channels) or downstream of Ca²⁺ influx (cf increased mEPP frequency) that however fail to normalize synaptic transmission.

Neuromuscular transmission has been investigated in several loss-of-function Caᵥ2.1 mouse mutants; in none, the alterations of NMJ transmission fully modeled those found in EA2 patients. Amplitude and quantal content of nerve stimulation-evoked EPP were reduced in homozygous Caᵥ2.1⁻/⁻, la/la, and rol/rol mice [56, 60, 132] and also (to a lower extent) in heterozygous la/+ and rol/+ mice [59, 60]; in contrast, the EEP amplitude and quantal content were unaltered in tg/tg and Caᵥ2.1⁻/⁺ mice [58, 59, 94]. A compensatory upregulation of non-P/Q Ca²⁺ channels (mainly R-type) was present in the homozygous mouse mutants, with the notable exception of rolling. Compensatory mechanisms downstream of Ca²⁺ influx that make Ca²⁺ ions more efficient in triggering exocytosis were also present at the NMJ of most mutants, as revealed by, e.g., an increased mEPP frequency in rol/rol [60] and tg/tg (in [58] but not in [94]) mice. Evidence for similar compensatory mechanisms downstream of Ca²⁺ influx had been previously obtained at central synapses of Caᵥ2.1⁻/⁻ mice [95].

In general, the functional studies of the loss-of-function Caᵥ2.1 mouse mutants have revealed several secondary presynaptic and postsynaptic compensatory changes that may affect excitability and may or may not normalize neurotransmission depending on the mouse mutation and the synapse. A critical issue is whether and to what extent these functional compensatory mechanisms are also present at central (in particular cerebellar) synapses of EA2 patients. This consideration can be extended to the alterations in synaptic organization and in gene expression found in the mouse mutants.

Functional consequences of SCA6 mutations

Studies in heterologous expression systems reported conflicting alterations in biophysical properties and/or membrane expression of recombinant Caᵥ2.1 channels with expanded polyglutamine stretches [20, 81, 96, 107, 125]. Most of the conflicting findings likely arise from the use of different splice variants of Caᵥ2.1. Indeed in one study, different human Caᵥ2.1 splice variants (−NP largely predominant in PCs and +NP) showed opposite changes in the voltage dependence of steady-state inactivation, leading to a predicted reduced (−NP) or enhanced (+NP) Ca²⁺ influx through mutant channels depending on the splice variant [125]. Strikingly, when the same −NP human Caᵥ2.1 isoform was expressed under the control of the native cacnala promoter in knockin mice, no differences in either biophysical properties or density of P/Q channels were found in Purkinje neurons dissociated from mice expressing channels with normal (13Q) or expanded (28Q) polyglutamines [110]. Moreover, the same human Caᵥ2.1 clone produced channels with different biophysical properties when expressed in HEK293 cells or mouse PCs; interestingly, only in the latter case were the biophysical properties similar to those of native P-type channels of PCs [110]. Unaltered functional properties of Caᵥ2.1 channels with expanded polyglutamine stretches were recently confirmed in SCA6 knockin mice carrying expanded CAG repeats in the cacnala locus [141]. These findings, and in particular the finding that biophysical properties of human Caᵥ2.1channels shown to be affected by SCA6 mutations in heterologous expression systems were not affected in Purkinje neurons, further show and emphasize that it is critical to study the functional consequences of pathogenic mutations in channels expressed in their endogenous neuronal environment at physiologically relevant levels. Moreover, these findings support the conclusion that the cerebellar dysfunctions in SCA6 are not caused by alterations in biophysical properties or membrane expression of Caᵥ2.1 channels.

The SCA6 knockin mice carrying a hyperexpanded (84Q) polyQ (but not those with an expanded polyQ similar to that of SCA6 patients) developed motor impairment with age; both the onset and severity of symptoms were allele-dosage dependent [141]. The relatively short life span of mice might explain the lack of motor phenotype in SCA6 KI mice with 30Q, since SCA6 patients with 30 repeats typically do not manifest symptoms until their 40s or 50s. Interestingly, Watase et al. [141] found that mutant Caᵥ2.1 channels with expanded polyQ form insoluble aggregates in the cerebellum in an age- and allele-dosage-dependent manner; neuronal inclusions predominantly in the cytoplasm of PCs, which were reminiscent of those seen in human SCA6 PCs [46] but without
neurodegenerative changes, were found in 22-month-old homozygous 84Q mice. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that SCA6 pathogenesis involves a toxic gain-of-function mechanism associated with accumulation of the expanded polyQ protein similar to that of other polyglutamine diseases [33]. SCA6 disease mechanisms similar to those of other polyQ diseases had been previously proposed by Kordasiewicz et al. [66] on the basis of their findings that the C-terminal region of Caᵥ2.1 is capable of being cleaved from the protein, translocating to the nucleus (in transfected HEK293 or cerebellar granule cells and also native PCs but not granule cells), and causing cell death of transfected cells if it contained an expanded polyQ (33Q). C-terminal fragments were not detected in cerebellar extracts from SCA6 KI mice, possibly because the cleaved product was sequestered in the large channel aggregates, suggesting that aberrant nuclear accumulation of the cleaved C-terminal fragment is not necessary to cause motor impairment [141].
