### Abstract

In spite of effective antibiotics to treat TB (tuberculosis) since the early 1960s, we enter the new millennium with TB, currently the leading cause of death from a single infectious agent, killing more than three million people worldwide each year. Thus an understanding of drug-resistance mechanisms, the immunobiology of cell wall components to elucidate host-pathogen interactions and the discovery of new drug targets are now required for the treatment of TB. Above the plasma membrane is a classical chemotype IV PG (peptidoglycan) to which is attached the macromolecular structure, mycolyl-arabinogalactan, via a unique diglycosylphosphoryl bridge. This review will discuss the assembly of the mAGP (mycolyl-arabinogalactan-peptidoglycan), its associated glycolipids and the site of action of EMB (ethambutol), bringing forward a new era in TB research and focus on new drugs to combat multidrug resistant TB.

### Introduction

The *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* cell envelope differs substantially from the cell wall structures of both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. This unique cell wall structure accounts for its unusual low permeability and resistance towards common antibiotics. The main structural element consists of a cross-linked network of PG (peptidoglycan) in which some of the muramic acid residues are replaced with a complex polysaccharide, AG (arabinogalactan). The AG is attached to PG through a unique linker unit, and in turn is acylated at its distal end to PG with mycolic acids. The entire complex is abbreviated as the mAGP (mycolyl-arabinogalactan–peptidoglycan) and is essential for viability in *M. tuberculosis* and other mycobacteria [1]. Our previous studies have elucidated the gross structural features of the mAGP complex, including aspects of its biosynthesis [1,2]. However, there are still substantial gaps in our knowledge of AG biosynthesis and the identification of potential new drug targets and in the biosynthesis of the related *M. tuberculosis* essential immunogen, LAM (lipoarabinomannan) [3].

### Biosynthesis of mycobacterial AG

The biosynthesis of AG (Figure 1) begins with the formation of the linker unit, through the transfer of GlcNAc-1-P and Rha from their respective sugar nucleotides, to form polyprenol-P-P-GlcNAc and polyprenol-P-P-GlcNAc-Rha [4]. Several studies have defined the genetics and enzymology surrounding the biosynthesis of dTDP-Rha and the *wbbL* rhamnosyltransferase [5,6]. Surprisingly, the GlcNAc transferase (*rfe*, Rv1302) has been largely ignored. Polyprenol-P-P-GlcNAc-Rha then serves as an acceptor for the sequential addition of Galf (galactofuranose) residues from UDP-Galf [7] to form polyprenol-P-P-GlcNAc-Rha-Gal₃₀. The bulk of galactan polymerization is performed by a novel enzyme designated GlfT (Rv3808c). This latter enzyme expresses two galactofuranosyltransferase activities, a UDP-Galf:β-D-(1 → 5)-Galf and a UDP-Galf:β-D-(1 → 6)-Galf, both activities being required for alternating β(1 → 5) and β(1 → 6) linkages during galactan polymerization [8,9]. Chemical analysis of the mature lipid-linked galactan, synthesized *in vitro*, suggests that this intermediate then serves as an acceptor for the subsequent addition of Araf (arabinofuranose) residues from β-D-arabinofuranosyl-1-monophosphoryldecaprenol [DPA (decaprenylmonophosphoryl-D-arabinose)] in the formation of the Araf portion (α1 → 5, α1 → 3 and β1 → 2 linkages) of AG [10,11]. The key steps leading to the biosynthesis of DPA, from pRpp (5-phospho-ribofuranose-pyrophosphate) [12] and DP (decaprenol phosphate), have recently been investigated by us [13] and others [14,15]. The AG-lipid intermediate is then at some point transglycosylated to PG and mycolylated [16].

of C. glutamicum emb resulted in a slow growing mutant possessing a truncated AG structure with only t-Araf (terminal Araf) residues [13]. Treatment of C. glutamicum with EMB resulted in an identical phenotype to the C. glutamicum emb mutant. Additionally, disruption of C. glutamicum ubiA, the first enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of DPA, resulted in a complete loss of cell wall arabinan. As a result we established for the first time, (i) that in contrast with M. tuberculosis embA and embB mutants, deletion of C. glutamicum emb leads to a highly truncated AG possessing only t-Araf residues, (ii) the exact site of attachment of arabinan chains in AG and (iii) that DPA is the only Araf sugar donor in AG biosynthesis, suggesting the presence of a novel enzyme responsible for ‘priming’ the galactan domain for further elaboration by downstream arabinofuranosyltransferases. It was surprising that deletion of the single C. glutamicum emb resulted in loss of numerous α(1 → 5), α(1 → 3) and β(1 → 2) Araf linkages. It is possible that C. glutamicum Emb is only involved in the synthesis of the α(1 → 5) arabinan segment of AG, prior to α(1 → 3) branching and β(1 → 2) Araf capping of AG, which results in the C. glutamicum emb deletion mutant phenotype. Interestingly, M. tuberculosis embA and embB were unable to complement the C. glutamicum emb deletion phenotype [13].

Following an analysis of genes surrounding the conserved emb locus, we identified and characterized a novel arabinofuranosyltransferase, AftA (Rv3792) [27]. The enzyme catalyses the addition of the first key Araf residue from DPA to the galactan domain of the cell wall, thus ‘priming’ the galactan for further elaboration by downstream arabinofuranosyltransferases. Since aftA is an essential gene in M. tuberculosis [28], we deleted its orthologue in C. glutamicum. Analysis of its cell wall revealed the complete absence of arabinose, resulting in a truncated cell wall structure possessing only a galactan core. Complementation of the mutant was restored to the wild-type phenotype by M. tuberculosis aftA. In addition, by developing an in vitro assay using recombinant Escherichia coli expressing M. tuberculosis aftA and cell wall galactan as an acceptor, we demonstrated the transfer of [¹⁴C]arabinose to galactan, and unlike the M. tuberculosis EmbA and EmbB proteins, M. tuberculosis AftA was not inhibited by EMB.


Earlier studies demonstrated that administration of the antituberculosis agent EMB (ethambutol) led to a rapid cessation of mycolic acid transfer to the cell wall and an accumulation of TMM (trehalose monomycolate) and TDM (trehalose dimycolate) [17]. Subsequently, EMB was shown to specifically inhibit AG biosynthesis [18]. The precise molecular target of EMB is derived from the emb locus in Mycobacterium avium (embRAB) [19] and M. tuberculosis (embCAB) [20]. To further define the role of EmbCAB proteins in arabinan biosynthesis, embA, embB and embC were individually inactivated by disruption in Mycobacterium smegmatis. Although all three mutants were viable, the crucial terminal Ara₆ motif of AG, which is the template for mycolylation, was only altered in embA and embB mutants, while LAM biosynthesis remained unaffected [21]. This suggested that both EmbA and EmbB are involved exclusively in the formation of the terminal Ara₆ motif in AG.


### More recent studies on AG biosynthesis

Our attempts to obtain deletion mutants of EmbA and EmbB in M. tuberculosis have proved unsuccessful, suggesting essentiality (G.S. Besra, unpublished work). Apart from sharing a similar mAGP [3] and availability of complete genome sequences [1], we [13,22–25] and others [26] have shown previously that Corynebacterium spp. are a useful model organism in the study of orthologous M. tuberculosis genes essential for viability. It was interesting to note in this regard that in comparison with M. tuberculosis, Corynebacterium glutamicum possesses only a single emb. Deletion


The biosynthesis of mycobacterial PIMs (phosphatidyl-myo-inositol mannosides), LM (lipomannan) and LAM

The biosynthesis of LAM involves the addition of mannopyranosyl [Manp (mannopyranose)] residues to PI (phosphatidyl-myo-inositol) to produce both PIMs (two to six Manp residues) and LM (up to 20 Manp and two to three Araf residues), which are further arabinosylated to form LAM [3]. The mannan core is a highly branched structure with an α(1 → 6)-linked Manp backbone being replaced at C-2 by single Manp residues. The arabinan domain consists of a linear α(1 → 5)-linked Araf backbone,

catalyses the formation of monoacylated PIM₃ [42]. As a result, we [42,44], and others [40] have shown that monoacylated PIM₃ is synthesized by the addition of Manp residues from GDP-Man to PI through a series of GDP-Man-dependent α-mannosyltransferases (PimA, PimB and PimC). However, recent knockout experiments in *M. tuberculosis* have suggested a degree of redundancy in PimB [45] and PimC [42], and further studies are required to clarify the roles of PimB and PimC in PIM biosynthesis more precisely [42,45]. Recent studies [34] have also demonstrated a redundant PIM pathway from monoacylated PIM₄, by the addition of Manp residues from the alkali-stable sugar donor C₅₀/C₃₅-PPM (C₅₀/C₃₅ polyrenyl monophosphomannose) [43] and PimE, to form α(1 → 2)-branched ‘higher-PIMs’ in the form of monoacylated PIM₅, which is then further mannosylated to monoacylated PIM₆. A parallel biosynthetic pathway extends monoacylated PIM₄ to linear LM via PPM-dependent α(1 → 6)mannosyltransferase(s) [46] and to a branched LM via α(1 → 2)mannosyltransferase(s) [47]. In summary, a number of key glycosyltransferases still remain to be identified in relation to the biosynthesis of AG and PIM₂, PIM₃, PIM₄ and PIM₆, the α(1 → 6)mannosyltransferase(s) involved in LM/LAM, additional LM/LAM-specific DPA-dependent arabinofuranosyltransferases, and finally the α(1 → 2)mannosyltransferase(s), which are involved in ‘cap-formation’ in ManLAM biosynthesis [48].
