■ Abstract The conversion of exogenous and endogenous proteins into immunogenic peptides recognized by T lymphocytes involves a series of proteolytic and other enzymatic events culminating in the formation of peptides bound to MHC class I or class II molecules. Although the biochemistry of these events has been studied in detail, only in the past few years has similar information begun to emerge describing the cellular context in which these events take place. This review thus concentrates on the properties of antigen-presenting cells, especially those aspects of their overall organization, regulation, and intracellular transport that both facilitate and modulate the processing of protein antigens. Emphasis is placed on dendritic cells and the specializations that help account for their marked efficiency at antigen processing and presentation both in vitro and, importantly, in vivo. How dendritic cells handle antigens is likely to be as important a determinant of immunogenicity and tolerance as is the nature of the antigens themselves.

INTRODUCTION

Despite our advanced understanding of the molecular interactions between peptide ligands, MHC molecules, and their receptors on T cells, the factors that determine the immunogenicity of proteins remain poorly understood. This situation reflects the fact that the cells and intracellular pathways leading to the formation of peptide-MHC complexes (pMHC) are intricate and variable, but essential to determining how antigens are processed and presented. Although these events have been characterized in general terms, they cannot yet be studied with the precision of the structural and biophysical approaches used to study peptide-MHC interactions.

The situation is further complicated by the fact that the cells responsible for antigen processing and presentation are proving richly diverse, perhaps reflecting the diversity of antigens and circumstances that the immune system is capable of dealing with. Thus, what is true concerning the response to one antigen may not hold true for others, and even the response to any given antigen can be quite variable. Processing and presentation are affected by several factors, including the

physical form of the antigen at time of delivery, the site and method of delivery, the nature of the antigen-presenting cell (APC) that first encounters the antigen, and the inflammatory status or adjuvant used. As a result, current approaches to inducing antigen-specific immunity remain largely empirical. For antigens that induce undesirable autoimmune or inflammatory responses, we still do not know the precise reasons for their immunogenicity, or why their repertoire is so limited.

The past several years have yielded great advances in our understanding of the cell biology and biochemistry of antigen processing and presentation. Much of what has been learned derives from in vitro studies that rely increasingly on cultured primary APCs. These efforts have begun to identify and characterize the various types of APCs involved, as well as mechanisms of action. A major challenge is to understand how these mechanisms are modified, controlled, and differentially applied to the diverse antigens, cell types, and conditions that mediate the immune response. Even more important is to determine how principles defined in vitro apply in vivo. Understanding APC function more fully is likely to rationalize the role of antigen in guiding the immune response (1).

This review assesses what we have learned thus far about the functional attributes of APCs, placing special emphasis on dendritic cells (DCs). The capture and processing of antigen by DCs plays a primary role in immunity, enabling T cells to detect their cognate peptide-MHC complexes in virtually all other settings, such as helping B cells, activating macrophages, and focusing cytokines and cytotoxic activities even on nonhematopoietic cells. For APCs to perform their functions, not only their activities but also their anatomical distributions are key. Accordingly, throughout the review we try to integrate how in vitro insights can help us understand antigen presentation in vivo.

## ANTIGEN-PRESENTING CELLS: ON THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING PROFESSIONAL

The demonstration that virtually any cell type expressing cell surface MHC class II α/β heterodimers was able to engage T cells in an antigen-specific manner (2) initiated a long series of studies in which surrogate APCs and model antigens could be studied under defined conditions in culture. Such approaches established some basic pathways for the loading of peptides onto MHC class I and class II (MHC-I and MHC-II) molecules (3–11). One important lesson that has emerged, however, is that different cell types can process and present antigens at vastly different efficiencies (12–14). This finding has led investigators to consider certain cells as “professional” APCs, a group that typically includes B lymphocytes, macrophages (MØ), and especially dendritic cells (DCs).

### The Cellular Basis of Antigen Presentation: Properties of Professional APCs In Vitro and In Vivo

B LYMPHOCYTES If B cells are not the most professional of all APCs, they are certainly the most focused. Their need to present antigen is intimately linked to their

primary function in antibody secretion, rather than the need to promulgate T cell responses (as is true for DCs). B cells are very poor at internalizing antigen except via their surface Ig receptors, which allows them to focus on generating pMHC-II that stimulates (and in turn receives help from) T cells, linking the specificity of the humoral and T cell responses.

Several factors contribute to their exquisite efficiency at presenting antigens on MHC-II (15, 16). Despite their modest capacity for endocytosis, binding of antigen to surface Ig induces internalization of the receptor, accelerates delivery to endocytic compartments, and possibly modulates expression of MHC-II (15, 16). Thus, B cells might be able to regulate their capacity for antigen presentation in response to external stimuli, analogous to the alterations exhibited by DCs during maturation (17).

B cells also constitutively express exceptionally high levels of MHC-II. B cell blasts, for example, express a higher density of MHC-II than even DCs (J. Unternaehrer & I. Mellman, in preparation). They also express abundant costimulatory and adhesion molecules needed for T cell interactions. B cells also express the chaperones human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DM and HLA-DO, which contribute to peptide loading onto MHC-II molecules. Although B cells can present endogenous antigens on MHC-I, presentation of exogenous antigens on MHC-I is poorly described in B cells and probably quite limited.

MACROPHAGES Macrophages (MO) have long been considered prototypical APCs, in part owing to the fact that they have been associated with innate immune responses to microorganisms for over a century. Their role as APCs was further emphasized by their extraordinary capacity for endocytosis, enabling them to internalize up to 50% of their cell surface area in a single round of particle phagocytosis or up to 200% of their surface area per hour during constitutive fluid uptake (18). MO can internalize virtually any form of antigen, cell-associated or soluble, either nonspecifically or via specific receptors (FcγR, lectins, etc.), allowing them to stimulate T cells of various specificities, a fact attested to by years of in vitro study.

MO express MHC-I, MHC-II, and costimulatory molecules, upregulating their levels upon activation by inflammatory cytokines or bacterial products. However, compared with B cells or DCs, the levels of MHC-II and costimulators expressed even by activated MO are substantially lower (Figure 1). These low levels of MHC-II in part explain why MO are generally less efficient at antigen presentation and T cell stimulation than either B cells or DCs, both ex vivo and in vivo (14, 19–23). MO are nevertheless present in great numbers at sites of infection and chronic inflammation where they may contribute to T cell stimulation.

In addition, despite MO's profound capacity for endocytosis, the organization and properties of the endocytic organelles found in MO may be suboptimal for efficient antigen presentation (14). Lysosomal compartments in MO are perhaps better adapted for digestion of internalized material, contributing to what may be a major function for MO in innate immunity: the clearance of invading microorganisms (see below) (24, 25).

The marginal zone of SER4-positive MO is interrupted where T cells enter the white pulp (*). The greatest MHC-II staining was due to DCs in the T cell area, greatly in excess of the MHC-II staining associated with MO in the marginal zone. (Reproduced from Reference 65.)

DENDRITIC CELLS: GENERAL AND DISTINCTIVE FEATURES Dendritic cells (DCs) are unique among all APCs in the adult immune system in many critical ways. Unlike MO or B cells, DCs' primary function appears to be antigen presentation. Both DCs and MO differentiate from circulating bone marrow-derived precursors and complete their differentiation upon leaving the bloodstream and taking residence in peripheral tissues. Nearly all tissues contain both DCs and MO at the steady state, although the two cell types differ in important ways. DCs have a unique distribution within lymphoid organs, accumulating in regions where MO and B cells are generally excluded. DCs are enriched in the areas where naive T cells are activated, in an optimal position to be interrogated by a continuously moving swarm of T cells seeking their cognate pMHC complexes (26–29) (Figure 1). DCs have unique surveillance and migratory properties (30), enabling them to carry antigens captured in the periphery to secondary lymphoid organs, or to internalize them directly from the lymph (31). This includes, for example, the sampling of commensal bacteria, which are ingested and rapidly destroyed by MO but conveyed by DCs to lymph nodes where they induce IgA responses (32). Similarly, apoptotic cells contained within migratory DCs can be observed in the afferent

lymphatics of the gut (33) en route to lymph nodes, probably to assist in the maintenance of self-tolerance (34).

These observations have interesting implications for how and where APCs may present antigen. MØ may present antigen in vivo, especially at sites of inflammation where the cytokine environment enhances their expression of MHC-II and costimulatory molecules, and where T cells are already present (35). However, DCs are significantly more efficient at T cell stimulation (14, 19–23) and are distinguished by their ability to stimulate immunologically naive T cells (19, 23). Mice deficient in some MØ populations genetically [op/op mice (36, 37)] or depleted using toxic liposomes (38) do not exhibit substantial defects in initiating adaptive immune responses, whereas the opposite is true in mice lacking DCs (39). Moreover, MHC-II expression on DCs is sufficient to initiate CD4 T cell responses (40, 41). The preeminence of DCs in initiating immune responses is likely to reflect a combination of basic features of DC biology: a greater inherent efficiency for antigen presentation, and the capacity to accumulate within the T cell areas of lymphoid organs. Although B cells might, at least in vitro, also accomplish these functions, the possibility that they do so in vivo is relatively insignificant given that B cells are mostly restricted to single antigenic specificities. Although it is beyond the scope of this review to consider the function of DCs in initiating and regulating the immune response in any detail, it must be mentioned that DCs also instruct T cell responses, being capable of polarizing T cell development (42) or inducing T cell tolerance (34). Regulatory T cells can also be uniquely stimulated to proliferate by DC, enhancing their suppressor capacity (43, 44). DCs can also perform some “innate” functions, such as secreting IL-12 and type I interferons, as well as mobilizing NK and NKT cells (23).

DCs endocytose avidly and present virtually any form of protein antigen on MHC-I or MHC-II molecules. Indeed, the ability of DCs to “cross-present” exogenous antigens on MHC-I molecules is arising as a distinguishing feature; MØ are also capable of cross-presentation, but with efficiencies that are orders of magnitude lower (45, 46). In addition to their distinct antigen handling and homing properties, DCs exhibit a variety of other features that greatly enhance their capacity as APCs. Among these are exceptionally high levels of MHC-II and costimulatory molecules, certainly as compared with MØ in most tissues (Figure 1). DCs also express CD86 at a greater than fivefold higher density than B cells (J. Unternaehrer & I. Mellman, in preparation). In addition, the extensive folds and dendritic extensions characteristic of DCs enables them to form close contact with multiple T cells simultaneously (47–49). MHC-II molecules on the DC plasma membrane also appear to be laterally clustered, which may further facilitate the efficiency of T cell scanning by increasing the effective local density of MHC molecules at contact sites, even in the absence of antigen-specific recognition (50–53; J. Unternaehrer & I. Mellman, in preparation).

CELLULAR SPECIALIZATIONS OF DCs: MATURATION One of the most complex and intriguing specializations of DCs is the process of maturation. Maturation was
a term originally used to describe the acquisition of antigen-presenting activity by cultured DCs after isolation from tissues. Epidermal Langerhans cells (LCs), for example, do not effectively present antigen when first isolated from skin explants, but they do after 1–2 days in culture (54). Over the past several years, this phenomenon has been extensively studied in vitro using DC cultures, illuminating some general principles and features of DC maturation. It is now clear that virtually all activities mediated by DCs are linked to and regulated by maturation.

First and foremost, maturation induces a dramatic structural reorganization (17), or “phenotypic maturation” (Figure 2). Functionally immature DCs, like the ones freshly isolated from tissues or that first arise from bone marrow cultures, express relatively low levels of surface MHC-II and costimulatory molecules. Instead, abundant MHC-II is accumulated within their lysosomal compartment, together with antigens internalized by the marked endocytic activity characteristic of most

Immunofluorescence images of mouse bone marrow–derived immature DC (*left*) and mature DC (*right*) expressing MHC-II-GFP are shown in green, and the resident lysosomal membrane protein Lamp is shown in red. Maturation was triggered in vitro by LPS. Under steady-state conditions, phenotypically immature DCs can be found in peripheral tissues and in secondary lymphoid organs. They are highly endocytic and accumulate most of their MHC-II molecules inside the cell in lysosomal compartments (Lamp⁺). Upon maturation, DCs become less endocytic, and MHC-II is transported to the plasma membrane, where it accumulates together with high levels of costimulatory molecules. Mature DCs are generally restricted to secondary lymphoid organs.
immature DCs (55, 56). DCs begin to mature immediately after receiving adequate stimulus [Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands, inflammatory cytokines, T cell ligands (e.g., CD40 ligand), NK cells, or disruption of homotypic contacts between immature DCs]. First, there is a transient increase in macropinocytic uptake (57), followed rapidly by its nearly complete downregulation (58–61). Second, MHC-II molecules escape from the lysosomal compartment and are transported to the plasma membrane (62, 63). Finally, the overall levels of MHC-II, costimulatory molecules, and MHC-I increase at the surface, which also begins to extend the DC's characteristic “dendritic” extensions and membrane folds. Concomitant with these events, the cells also enhance their ability to form and to accumulate pMHC-II complexes, even using antigen internalized before the maturation stimulus (55, 56). The mechanistic details of how this occurs are considered below.

While such observations define a useful general paradigm, they are almost certainly an oversimplification of the actual situation. DCs of multiple maturation phenotypes (immature DCs, mature DCs, and cells exhibiting intermediate to high levels of MHC molecules with or without high expression of costimulatory molecules) can be detected in lymph nodes at the steady state (64–68). Although some of these may be DCs still in the process of maturation, an intriguing possibility is that they represent distinct functional states, reflecting the qualitatively different modes of T cell stimulation that DCs are capable of effecting.

There is now considerable evidence that DCs serve not only to initiate immunity but also to maintain peripheral tolerance, deleting self-reactive T lymphocytes and/or expanding regulatory T cells, encouraging them to become more suppressive in an antigen-specific manner (34, 43, 44). Because the induction of T cell tolerance was classically thought to result from the presentation of pMHC in the absence of costimulatory molecules, one idea is that immature DCs present in lymph nodes comprise a tolerogenic population. It is possible that immature DCs do make sufficient pMHC to perform this function. However, maturation (or the onset of an inflammatory state in vivo) may enhance the absolute number, and possibly the repertoire, of MHC-II and pMHC complexes manyfold. Thus, optimal tolerance induction may require the antigen processing activity of a mature DC to ensure that self-pMHC are made at the same efficiency under tolerogenic conditions as under conditions leading to immunity; this is important lest an immunogenic mature DC present a self-antigen to which tolerance has not been assured.

Some DCs with “intermediate” maturation phenotypes (e.g., high MHC-II, low or moderate CD86) (64, 65) may represent tolerogenic populations. However, the actual characteristics of tolerogenic DCs remain unknown (34, 44). Reconciling the function versus the phenotype of mature DCs is further complicated by the fact that different maturation stimuli may produce qualitatively different outcomes: mature DCs that are immunostimulatory in distinct ways, selectively polarizing Th1 versus Th2 responses (42). Such effects may reflect differential production of cytokines or alterations in the expression of surface molecules, but they demonstrate that not all DCs that appear phenotypically mature are functionally equivalent. Even though the terminology used to describe DC maturation is clearly inadequate, we

limit our use of the concept here to denote the general phenotypic and biochemical changes triggered by classical maturation stimuli in vitro.

DENDRITIC CELL HETEROGENEITY Apart from their maturation state, several classes of DCs can be distinguished in vivo on the basis of their progenitors, tissue distribution, and surface markers (69–71). In the mouse, up to five distinct populations have been proposed (72). DCs expressing CD8α, for example, have been associated with the cross-presentation of exogenous antigens on MHC-I. Whether this reflects a fundamental difference or simply the enhanced phagocytic activity of this particular population is unknown (73). In general, the extent to which each of these populations represent functionally distinct entities is unclear.

Nevertheless, it has proved practical to use defined cell culture systems and assess their properties to analyze the cell biological basis of DC function. Four DC types have been most often studied in culture: (a) nonproliferating human CD14+ monocyte-derived DCs (differentiated in GM-CSF and IL-4), (b) mouse myeloid DCs differentiated from proliferating bone marrow progenitors, (c) human LC-like DCs derived from proliferating CD34+ stem cells, and (d) human (or mouse) plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs). Monocyte- and bone marrow–derived cells have many features in common, and indeed our general understanding of DC organization, maturation, and function derive from these systems. At the same time, the two are likely to have some important differences. pDCs, however, are quite distinct and in some respects are closer to B lymphocytes and plasma cells than to monocyte- and bone marrow–derived DCs (70). Although they do not secrete antibody, pDCs contain abundant endoplasmic reticulum (ER), express less MHC-II than myeloid DCs, and are distinguished by a marked capacity for releasing type I interferons, even without exposure to infectious virus. pDCs have thus been associated with viral immunity and autoimmune disorders (74). Other DC populations can be distinguished (LCs, blood DCs), and it will be important to establish how many of these recapitulate the general principles established thus far. It is now important to relate these basic insights obtained with DC cultures to DC function in vivo; that the two are related is without doubt, but identifying the connections is not always easy. By allowing comparisons of underlying mechanisms, differences are instructive and help provide insights into in vivo function.

THE AMATEUR HOUR Although high-level expression of MHC-II molecules is largely restricted to professional APCs described above, other cell types also express MHC-II molecules under normal and/or pathological condition, including endothelial cells (75, 372), some epithelial cells (76), and tumor cells (77). Together with MHC-II, these cell types express variable levels of costimulatory molecules and accessory factors (invariant chain, HLA-DM, HLA-DO), giving rise to heterogeneous capacity for antigen processing and presentation, and consequently to a variable repertoire of peptides selected, which are often derived from endogenous proteins (78, 79). Presentation of endogenous proteins by these “nonprofessional”

APCs can mediate tissue damage in autoimmune conditions or may alter immunosurveillance of tumors, but their precise contribution is not yet clear.

# THE MECHANISTIC BASIS OF ANTIGEN PROCESSING

Having considered the cellular basis of antigen processing and presentation, we now turn to a more mechanistic consideration of how APCs perform their tasks. Interestingly, both MHC-I- and MHC-II-restricted antigen processing pathways rely on ancient proteolytic mechanisms (proteasomes, lysosomes) that in the vast majority of cell types are used simply for catabolic and homeostatic purposes. Rather than develop dedicated mechanisms, evolution chose to modify preexisting ones for use in the immune response.

Until recently, MHC-I and MHC-II were thought to focus on the presentation of peptides derived from distinct sources. MHC-I ligands were derived from endogenous cytosolic proteins, whereas MHC-II ligands were exogenous, encountering MHC-II molecules following endocytosis. Although this paradigm remains largely correct, we now know that both boundaries can be crossed: MHC-I can present peptides derived from exogenous antigens, and MHC-II can present intracellular antigens that do not come from the extracellular space. Although virtually all nucleated cells, not just professional or amateur APCs, can present endogenous proteins on MHC-I, DCs (and to a far lesser extent MO) can efficiently use exogenously obtained peptides for this purpose: an event referred to as “cross-presentation.” Moreover, it is important to remember that only DCs can prime naive CD8⁺ T cell responses, regardless of antigen source. We consider both the various sources and fates of antigens sampled and presented by APCs.

## SOURCES OF ANTIGENS IN THE MHC-I PATHWAY

### Endogenous Proteins

Endogenous proteins destined for presentation on MHC-I molecules are ubiquitinated in the cytosol and fed to the proteasome to initiate fragmentation for MHC-I presentation. However, the source of proteasomal substrates is quite varied (Figure 3). Peptide ligands for MHC-I can be derived from cryptic transcription products, such as open reading frames contained within 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions, alternative open reading frames, introns, or intron-exon junctions (80–89). Defective ribosomal products (DRiPs) are also a source of proteasomal substrates, offering a broad sample of the cellular and viral proteins synthesized by the APC (90). In DCs, DRiPs can accumulate transiently as aggregates in the cytosol during maturation and are believed to affect the repertoire of endogenous proteins available for proteasomal digestion (91, 92).

MHC-I ligands are also obtained from “stable” proteins, as evidenced by presentation of several species of posttranslationally modified peptides: N-glycosylated

Figure 3 Possible sources of proteins presented on MHC-I molecules. MHC-I ligands have been shown to derive from various sources, including (1) cytosolic proteins (endogenous or viral), (2) alternative translation products and defective ribosomal products, (3) proteins retrotranslocated to the cytosol from the ER, and (4) internalized proteins transferred to the cytosol and imported into the ER in a TAP-dependent fashion. In each of these routes, proteins are ultimately degraded in the cytosol by the proteasome and further trimmed by cytosolic peptidases. The resulting peptides are transported into the lumen of the ER for loading on newly synthesized MHC-I products. There is also evidence for another pathway (5) in which internalized proteins are processed and loaded in the endocytic pathway onto MHC-I molecules that recycle from the plasma membrane, independently of TAP. For detailed reviews concerning the biochemical steps involved in the MHC-I pathway, see, for example, References 3–7, 82.

peptides (93), phosphopeptides (94), de-amidated peptides (e.g., Asn to Asp) (93), or peptides with modified cysteine residues (95). Also, for some antigens the efficiency of presentation correlates with the abundance of the mature protein (96–98).

Proteins synthesized on membrane-bound ribosomes destined for the secretory pathway appear to be segregated from the proteasome and therefore ineligible for the conventional pathway. However, secretory and membrane proteins can still gain access to the cytosol after being retrotranslocated from the ER, in a process that typically results in ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation (82, 99–102). This process was first believed to involve retrograde transport through the Sec61 channel (103). However, it now seems more likely that other proteins (e.g., Derlin-1, VIMP) play this role, together with the cytosolic ATPase p97 (104, 105). The system is opportunistically targeted by viruses, which encode proteins that downregulate surface MHC-I, helping infected cells evade T cell killing (106–108). Many peptides derived from membrane or secretory proteins correspond to sequences derived either from the transmembrane regions or signal sequences (109–112), although it is unclear how such peptides are derived.

It was recently reported that MHC-I ligands can contain sequences that are not contiguous in the original protein but are spliced together from neighboring peptides (113, 114). These findings suggest that if there are no major restrictions to the splicing reaction, the number of potential MHC-I epitopes could be considerably larger than anticipated. Peptide splicing was previously described in bacteria, plants, and protozoans, but these cases may not be mechanistically related.

## Exogenous Proteins

Exogenous proteins (i.e., not synthesized by the APC) constitute a critical source of peptide ligands for MHC-I, and they are quite prevalent in priming CD8⁺ T cell responses (Figure 4). Indeed, cross-presentation may be the main way MHC-I-restricted responses to tumor antigens or microbes that do not infect DCs can be generated: DCs could ingest infected cells or cancer cells and derive antigens from these sources (72, 115). The “exogenous” pathway also provides a unique opportunity for APCs to present internalized antigens simultaneously on MHC-I, MHC-II, and CD1. However, presentation of exogenous proteins in the absence of their coding sequences is not able to present cryptic epitopes derived from alternative genomic transcripts, which are recognized in certain antiviral, antitumor, and autoimmune responses (83–89).

To some extent, exogenous antigens can be presented on MHC-I in a TAP-independent manner, indicating that they do not require transport to the cytosol and can thus be loaded in the endocytic pathway (116–120) (pathway 5 in Figure 3). Exogenous antigens can also be transferred to the cytosol, where they are digested by proteasomes and loaded onto MHC-I in a TAP-dependent manner (120–124) (pathway 4 in Figure 3).

DCs can apparently modulate their capacity for presentation of exogenous antigens during maturation (45, 125–127), at least in part independently of their capacity to load endogenous proteins on MHC-I or to regulate MHC-II presentation

Figure 4 Cross-presentation: possible routes of access to the cytosol for internalized proteins to be presented on MHC-I. Exogenous antigens can gain access to MHC class I molecules following endocytosis. It remains unclear, however, what the mechanisms are by which they traverse the endosomal membrane that comprises the compartment barrier separating the antigens from the proteasome (120). Indirect evidence suggests that antigens egress from endosomes or lysosomes, although it is unknown if this occurs by transient physical rupture of the endosomal membrane or if it reflects the existence of a specific channel or translocator. Alternatively, antigens might make use of an established retrograde pathway leading from endosomes to the Golgi and then to the ER (purple arrows), or following internalization in caveolae, a fraction of which fuse with the ER (blue arrows). From the ER lumen, antigens may reach the cytosol using a translocation channel that is involved in retrotranslocation during protein degradation (103). The identity of this channel is uncertain (104, 105). Elements of the ER can conceivably gain access to endosomal compartments by normal recycling or possibly by fusion of ER with endosomal or phagosomal membranes (see text for details).

(45). CD40 ligand induced cross-presentation in bone marrow-derived DCs (45), although in vivo loading of exogenous proteins on MHC-I in DCs was not dependent on CD40, indicating that other signals must also be capable of activating this pathway (67).

# The Elusive Mechanism of Cross-Presentation

The pathway of “cross-presentation” introduces a remarkable problem in membrane topology: How are antigens contained in the lumen of endocytic vesicles transferred across membranes for proteasomal proteolysis in the cytosol? Cross-presentation occurs with greatest efficiency in DCs, although MO and other cell types may be partially capable of this activity as well (120). To be cross-presented, antigens can be internalized by multiple mechanisms, including receptor-mediated endocytosis via clathrin-coated vesicles [FcγR (45, 124), the lectin DEC-205 (128)], macropinocytosis, or phagocytosis (120, 129, 130). In fact, mice injected with a small amount of soluble antigen targeted to the antigen receptor DEC-205 show a strong and persistent activation of CD8⁺ T cells by cross-presentation (128).

Regardless of the efficiency, the topology problem remains: How do proteins reach the cytosol from whichever endocytic organelle they reside after internalization? One possibility is egress from endosomal compartments, as exploited by several bacterial toxins (131, 133). Endocytic compartments appear to “leak” part of their content or to contain specific channels or translocators that permit egress of proteins or peptides to the cytosol by means of size-limited channels or leak pathways (120, 122, 124, 373), but their biochemical basis has proved difficult to establish.

Another possibility is that a fraction of internalized antigens may be delivered to the ER where escape to the cytosol could capitalize on the ER’s ability to mediate protein transfer across membranes (103) (Figure 4). Although delivery to the ER after endocytosis is a rare event, there is good evidence that internalized proteins can reach the ER in a number of ways. Several bacterial toxins use this strategy to penetrate into the cytosol (131, 133). Similarly, some viruses (e.g., SV40) internalized via caveolae are delivered to the ER (134–136). Proteins containing the KDEL ER retrieval signal can be detected and returned to the ER following endocytosis via clathrin coated pits (137). COPI proteins normally involved in traffic between the ER and the Golgi have been shown to play a functional role at the level of endosomes (138–140). Thus, an intersection between the endocytic and early secretory pathways is well documented.

Cross-presentation was recently proposed as involving the ER in phagocytic process. Proteomic analysis of isolated phagosomes suggested that several ER components, including TAP and tapasin, may be components of the phagosome membrane (141), suggesting that exogenous proteins may already gain access to the ER-based MHC-I loading machinery in phagosomes (142–145). Recent experiments have shown that a viral-derived TAP antagonist (CMV US6) added to the

outside of DCs inhibits cross-presentation (120) and may impede even endogenous presentation (P. Cresswell, personal communication). Such findings are consistent with a functional intersection between the endocytic or phagocytic pathways with the ER, but they do not define how or from what compartment antigen egress itself occurs. Functional fusion between the ER and the phagosomal or plasma membrane is difficult to demonstrate (141), although there is functional evidence for endosomal fusion at sites of phagocytosis (146), under conditions in which an appreciable contribution from the ER cannot be detected (147). Certain bacteria (e.g., *Legionella*) encode proteins required to recruit ER during phagocytosis to avoid transfer to lysosomes; otherwise, conventional phagocytosis occurs in their absence (148). A similar situation has been observed during phagocytosis in Dictyostelium: ER elements associate (but do not necessarily fuse) with forming phagosomes containing *Legionella* but not *E. coli* (149). It is critical to attempt a visualization and selective disruption of individual membrane transport steps of the possible pathways involved in cross-presentation to firmly elucidate the mechanisms of cross-presentation.

One further consideration pertains to the traffic of the MHC-I molecules that are loaded with exogenous peptides. Elimination of a tyrosine residue in the cytoplasmic domain of murine MHC-I reduced entry of at least a subpopulation of MHC-I into late endocytic compartments and also reduced their capacity for cross-presentation (150). This observation is consistent with the idea that loading of MHC-I for cross-presentation occurs within endocytic compartments, but further work is required to demonstrate this directly and to establish the source of the peptides used for loading.

## SOURCES OF ANTIGENS IN THE MHC-II PATHWAY

Antigens loaded on MHC-II are typically exogenous proteins internalized by the APC or endogenous proteins resident in the endosomal system. However, antigens presumably excluded from the endosomal system, such as proteins localized in the cytosol or the nucleus, can also be presented by MHC-II molecules (151–162). In fact, a fraction of the peptides bound to MHC-II are derived from proteins normally resident in the cytosol (163–170). Thus, the presence of endogenous cellular proteins on MHC-II is not restricted to a few select antigens (171).

In principle, these cytosolic antigens could be recaptured as exogenous material by endocytosis of antigen liberated from apoptotic cells, or by phagocytosis of apoptotic bodies. However, in many cases the cytosolic epitopes were isolated from cell lines in culture, which are not highly phagocytic. Also, a high rate of cell death and phagocytosis would be necessary to account for the abundance of some cytosolic epitopes. A more likely source of peptides derived from cytosolic antigens is the transfer of material from the cytosol into lysosomes, or autophagy (172) (Figure 5). The sampling of cytosolic proteins for MHC-II presentation may be relevant for (*a*) viruses that fuse at the plasma membrane, releasing most of their

Figure 5 Types of endocytosis used for antigen accumulation. APCs internalize exogenous antigens using, to variable extents, the same mechanisms of endocytosis found in other cell types and organisms. Phagocytosis involves the ingestion of large particles or cells >1 μm in diameter. Particle binding to specific receptors signals actin assembly and drives pseudopod extension and particle engulfment. It has recently been proposed that the ER fuses with the cell surface to supply the extra membrane for this event, although this suggestion still awaits direct support (374). Macropinocytosis is constitutive in MØ and immature DCs, but it can also be triggered by growth factors or certain pathogenic bacteria (e.g., Salmonella). Macropinocytosis is also actin-dependent and can account for the uptake of large quantities of extracellular fluid and fluid-dissolved antigens. Soluble receptor-ligand complexes are typically internalized by clathrin-coated vesicles or (to a lesser extent) by caveolin-containing invaginations designated “caveolae.” It is unclear if DCs exhibit this mode of uptake, but they may exhibit a related form of endocytosis that involves neither clathrin nor caveolin. Proteins internalized by any of these mechanisms eventually reach endosomal/lysosomal compartments, where they can be processed by resident proteases and loaded onto MHC-II, typically newly synthesized, but also recycled from the plasma membrane. Endogenous proteins in the cytosol or other organelles can also be imported into lysosomes by autophagy, or perhaps by TAP, for loading onto MHC-II. (For more detailed overviews of endocytic mechanisms see, for example, 188, 189. For more detailed views of the MHC-II pathway see, for example, 8, 9, 364.)

proteins directly in the cytosol; (b) viruses that establish persistent latent infections and constitutively express low levels of cytosolic antigens (173); and perhaps even (c) tolerogenic presentation of endogenous cytosolic proteins. Proteins from other compartments (e.g., the nucleus) might similarly be presented on MHC-II following autophagy. Furthermore, there is evidence for presentation on MHC-II after cytoplasmic processing (158, 174) and TAP-dependent translocation of cytosolic as well as exogenous antigens (L. Eisenlohr, personal communication).

The results summarized above indicate a lack of absolute topological restrictions on MHC-I and MHC-II, implying that in principle, any protein can potentially be presented on MHC-I or MHC-II (Figures 4 and 5). The differences between MHC-I and MHC-II may thus be distinguished more on the basis of their binding characteristics and physiological role. The relative contribution of the different routes in vivo is still unknown. Their prevalence likely depends on the nature of the antigen and the mechanisms available in the APC involved, which can be further altered by host-microbe interactions (107, 108, 175, 176).

## MECHANISMS OF EXOGENOUS ANTIGEN CAPTURE

The fact that different APCs capture antigens in different ways makes a critical contribution to the heterogeneity of what they can present. It is therefore worth reconsidering the relative contributions of the multiple ways in which APCs can capture antigens, again both in vitro and in vivo.

### Extracellular Loading

The simplest way of loading peptides on MHC-I and MHC-II is by direct binding of isolated peptides to MHC molecules exposed at the cell surface. Experimentally, loading MHC extracellularly with defined peptides is broadly employed in epitope mapping studies and in clinical trials that use “peptide pulsed” APCs. Direct peptide loading can conceivably occur in vivo if the required peptide ligand is available at sufficient concentration in the extracellular space. Perhaps in support of this possibility, empty or peptide-receptive MHC-II (177, 178) and H2-M (179, 180) have been detected at the surface of APCs. Furthermore, in vitro studies suggest that APCs can sometimes present peptides generated and released by neighboring cells. However, the contribution of peptide exchange at the cell surface in vivo remains unknown. The abundance of Ii-derived peptides in cells deficient in H2-M (181) suggests that this exchange mechanism may not be very prevalent. Peptide exchange at the cell surface is unlikely to be highly dependent on H2-M given its rather strict requirement for acid pH (182, 183).

pMHC formed from direct binding of free peptides to MHC-II may have a different conformation and specificity for T cell stimulation than the same pMHC formed by the same peptide extracted from the intact protein by intracellular processing (184, 185). Although demonstrated as yet for only a restricted number of examples, if this consideration applies more generally, it has implications for

epitope mapping studies and peptide-based vaccines. A dual conformation for  
a peptide bound to MHC-I (HLA-B*2705) but not for HLA-B*2709 (differing  
from HLA-B*2705 in a single amino acid) was observed by X-ray crystallography  
(186). Interestingly, the HLA allele that gives rise to a dual conformation is associ-  
ated with autoimmunity. The biochemical basis for why alternative conformations  
might exist remains unknown, making it difficult to decide the phenomenon's  
physiological or pathological significance.

## Mechanisms of Antigen Uptake for Intracellular  
Loading: Overview of Endocytosis

Although peptide exchange can occur at the cell surface, conversion of internalized  
antigens (or endogenous antigens for MHC-I) into pMHC is almost certainly more  
prevalent, and ironically more efficient. The relative use by APCs of alternative  
endocytic routes (Figure 5) dictates not only their capacity for antigen uptake, but  
also that different endocytic routes may have different functional consequences  
(25, 187). For example, the ingestion of microbes is generally accompanied by  
inflammatory responses, whereas the opposite may occur after uptake of apoptotic  
or necrotic cells. TLRs appear not only to signal the presence of pathogens but also  
to modulate early events during phagocytic uptake and the kinetics of lysosomal  
fusion (188, 189). In DCs, endocytosis is upregulated shortly after maturation is  
induced (57) and is subsequently downregulated (59–61), but not all forms of  
endocytosis may be affected in the same way.

Four general types of endocytosis can be distinguished on the basis of the  
size of cargo internalized and/or the mechanism of internalization: phagocytosis,  
macropinocytosis, clathrin-dependent receptor-mediated endocytosis, and cave-  
olae-mediated endocytosis (190, 191) (Figure 5). Some forms of entry may involve  
an as-yet-uncharacterized non-clathrin/non-caveolar pathway. Furthermore, some  
pathogens (e.g., *Toxoplasma gondii*) gain entry by helping to form their own  
parasitophorous vacuoles *de novo* (192). Under normal conditions, the common  
fate for internalized solutes is delivery to hydrolase-rich lysosomes. In some cases,  
however, delivery to the Golgi complex or ER is also possible (131, 193, 194).

## Macropinocytosis

One of the most common ways of studying antigen presentation ex vivo has been  
to expose APCs to large concentrations of soluble model antigens for various  
periods (1 h to 1 day). In the case of immature DCs and probably MØ, the bulk of  
these antigens are internalized via macropinocytosis (60, 61, 195). This form of  
endocytosis in DCs is downregulated upon maturation, but there seems to be little  
effect on clathrin-mediated pathway (61). Thus, even in mature DCs, antigen (at  
least when targeted to specific receptors), might still be internalized and thus in  
principle available for processing and representation.

The impact of antigen uptake via macropinocytosis in vivo is not clear. It may  
certainly apply to those cells encountering antigens present in fluids, but many

antigen encounters probably occur in tissues, where extracellular fluid is not abundant. Furthermore, pathogens release few soluble antigens, with most proteins integrated in membranes, cell walls, or cytoplasmic compartments that would need to be taken up as particles (i.e., by phagocytosis).

Under conditions in which antigens are indeed available in soluble forms, especially after experimental injections of antigen, MØ and immature DCs use their well-developed macropinocytic activity for capture. In fact, MØ and DCs are the main cell types found to carry injected soluble antigens to lymph nodes after intravenous, intraperitoneal, or intradermal injections (25, 196, 197). In contrast, B cells have very low macropinocytic activity. If they are incubated ex vivo for long periods with high concentrations of soluble antigens, B cells manage to present them on MHC-II or MHC-I (16). These conditions are unlikely to occur in vivo, where B cells are mostly limited to the capture of trace amounts of antigens for which they carry specific cell surface receptors (see below). After intravenous injection of a high dose of hen egg lysozyme (HEL), most B cells display HEL-derived pMHC in vivo (198), although the pathway leading to presentation of nonspecific antigens by B cells is decidedly different than that responsible for receptor-mediated presentation (199). Moreover, when mice are injected with lower doses of antigen, no antigen internalization or pMHC formation is detected in B cells (31).

## Mechanisms and Functions of Receptor-Mediated Endocytosis in Antigen Presentation

The immune system uses a broad range of cell surface receptors to capture extracellular material more efficiently (15, 200). Receptor-mediated antigen uptake has at least two important consequences for the immune system. First, the concentrating effect has clear quantitative advantages, making antigen capture by APCs both faster and more efficient because they can present antigen found at much lower concentrations, usually by several orders of magnitude (15). Even highly macropinocytic cells like MØ and DCs benefit from receptor-mediated uptake mechanisms: At least a fraction of the uptake of typical fluid phase markers (dextran, HRP) can be accounted for by mannose receptor binding in DCs (61, 195).

Second, qualitative aspects of receptor-mediated antigen uptake can contribute to functional diversity among different APCs, by selective expression of receptors or by functionally different consequences upon ligand engagement. An example of how expression of certain antigen receptors on select APCs can have profound effects on the immune response was provided by the study of DEC-205, a lectin-like receptor preferentially expressed by DCs that is internalized by clathrin-coated vesicles (201–203). Targeting antigens to DEC-205 (using monoclonal antibodies against DEC-205 as surrogate ligands) resulted in a 100-to 1000-fold more efficient antigen capture and presentation than soluble antigen, inducing either tolerogenic responses (under noninflammatory conditions) or strong immunity (under activating conditions, co-administered with CD40L). Antigens delivered via DEC-205

were presented on both MHC-II and MHC-I, leading to strong activation of CD4 and CD8 T cells (128, 204, 205). These results indicate how targeting select APCs in situ via specific antigen receptors can be exploited successfully to manipulate antigen presentation and immunogenicity. The nature of the receptor and subsequent endosomal targeting pathways may also be key. DEC-205, for example, is more effective than mannose receptor in mediating antigen presentation in vitro (203); this may contribute to its efficacy in vivo.

An example of functional differences between APCs and their endocytic abilities is provided by Fcγ receptors (FcγR), which highlight how the immune system can use similar capture mechanisms for qualitatively different results. Antigens bound to soluble Ig can follow different fates depending on the cell type that captures them. Inhibitory, endocytosis-incompetent FcγR splice variants on B cells prevent receptor-mediated uptake of antibody-antigen complex (206), whereas endocytosis-competent FcγR on MO and DCs foster antigen capture and presentation (15, 207). B cell type FcγR are also expressed on “follicular DCs” in B cell follicles, where they may help retain antigen for B cell recognition (208, 209). Finally, the MHC-I-related neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) expressed on epithelial cells can capture IgG-antigen complexes, but instead of delivering their cargo to lysosomal compartments, they transcytose the immune complexes to the lamina propria, where they can then be recaptured by resident DCs (210).

Antigen receptors can be highly specific and selective for unique antigens, like the surface Ig on B cells. Their affinity for the antigen can sometimes be quite high, allowing B cells to capture antigens present at minute concentrations (15). Depending on the affinity of the bound antibodies, they can affect the release of antigen in endosomal compartments and even help sculpt the action of lysosomal proteases on the antigen. Such an “imprinting” effect of the bound antibody can mediate the selective pairing of B and T cells (16, 211, 212). Ligation of the B cell receptor also seems to induce rearrangement of endosomal compartments and is thought to promote pMHC formation (213).

Some APCs also express receptors for antigen-derived fragments bound to endogenous heat shock proteins, resulting in re-presentation of the internalized peptide (214, 215). Certain TLRs (e.g., TLR5) can bind directly to microbial antigens, and conceivably could also result in presentation (216).

Many other endocytic receptors on APCs (complement receptors, scavenger receptors, lectins) are not specific for individual protein antigens and do not recognize protein determinants directly. Many of them are related to similar receptors found in invertebrates and even in some unicellular organisms. These receptors are often implicated in adsorption of microbes, and are sometimes shown to be involved in their uptake, processing, and presentation. The lectin DC-SIGN, for example, interacts with HIV, although the immediate consequence is to sequester the virus from immune recognition rather than trigger a presentation response (217). The abundance of receptors, particularly lectins, on DCs and other APCs will likely provide an array of specificities that facilitate antigen uptake.

Phagocytosis

The uptake of particulate antigens is a very prevalent form of antigen uptake in vivo for both pathogen-derived and endogenous antigens. From an evolutionary perspective, it is probably also the first pathway associated with host defense. A number of the endocytic receptors that can recognize ligands free in solution also contribute to the phagocytic process by recognizing their ligands on the surface of microbes. These include FcγRs, complement receptors, and a variety of lectins. Even in the eventual absence of strong adsorptive receptors, some microbes can actively promote their own entry into cells (218) or shed vesicles that may be internalized (219).

APCs vary widely in their capacity for phagocytosis. B cells are very poorly phagocytic (220–222). Presentation of particulate antigens by some B cell lines has been described, but it was weaker and more limited than MO and was significantly lower with B cells isolated from spleen (223). Other APCs like MO and immature DCs can avidly phagocytose a broad range of particulates, including apoptotic cells, microbes, inert particles, or liposomes.

The engulfment of apoptotic cells provides antigenic material that can be readily converted into pMHC. DCs can actually produce pMHC-II complexes (YAE antigen) more efficiently from apoptotic splenocytes than from preprocessed peptide (224). The phagocytosis by APCs of endogenous cells that have died during microbial infections is emerging as an important way of sampling pathogens present in the engulfed cells, especially for microbes that may not infect APCs (33, 72, 225–228). The ingestion of apoptotic cells is also believed to play a key role in sampling self-antigens in the steady state for the maintenance of tolerance (73, 229, 230). When captured by APC, apoptotic cells have the potential to serve up a “complete meal” of self-antigens, in principle without regard to their intracellular localization or solubility, although it is not yet established that antigens in different intracellular localizations are equivalently processed. In fact, the intracellular location of antigen may affect presentation (96, 231, 232).

The capture of apoptotic bodies by DC was first described in cell culture, but DCs have been shown to acquire self-antigens from apoptotic cells and present them in situ (33, 233). It is not clear whether capture of apoptotic cells by DCs in vivo takes place before, during, or after cell death. If the lessons from model organisms apply to mammals, apoptosis and engulfment should be highly synchronized, favoring “local” engulfment triggered by death (24, 234).

DCs have been found to contain viral antigens shortly after infection under conditions in which DCs themselves do not appear infected, indicating that DCs capture viral antigens from neighboring infected cells (225). Also, DCs may not always wait for other cells to die before sampling them, since DCs could conceivably “bite” pieces of live neighboring cells (235, 236). There is evidence that T cells (237), B cells (223, 238), and DCs (239) nibble pieces of contacting live cells. Even infectious viruses can be transferred between living cells without requiring cell death (240–244). The transfer of cell fragments between live neighboring cells

has been described in several other systems, such as the transfer of melanin from melanocytes to keratinocytes in the skin (245) or the capture of membrane-bound ligands in invertebrates (246, 247).

Having considered the mechanisms of antigen uptake, we now turn to the mechanisms of antigen processing.

# ANTIGEN PROCESSING IN THE MHC-I PATHWAY

It is now well established that the proteasome plays a critical role in initiating protein breakdown to generate most peptide ligands for MHC-I (82, 248–250). The subunit composition of the proteasome and the expression of modulatory cofactors can vary between tissues and also in response to an inflammatory environment, affecting the repertoire of peptides produced (251–254). The proteasome has also recently been implicated in the splicing of peptides to create MHC-I ligands that are not contiguous in the original protein sequence (114).

Proteasome digestion products usually require N-terminal trimming by cytosolic peptidases (255–257). A delicate balance must be maintained because excess trimming by cytosolic peptidases can also destroy MHC-I epitopes. Cytosolic chaperones are thought to protect peptides from exhaustive degradation in the cytosol (258). After peptides are transported into the ER, there is even further trimming by an amino peptidase resident in the ER (designated ERAAP or ERAP1) (259–262) (Figure 3). These final trimming steps, thought to be influenced by binding to MHC-I, are critical for proper peptide loading (82, 263, 264). For some epitopes, the residues flanking the core MHC-I ligand can influence processing (82), and mutations in such regions can result in immune evasion (265). These examples emphasize that the selection of antigenic peptides does not follow strict universal rules, contributing to our relative inability to predict immunogenicity.

Those antigens that are presented on MHC-I via the exogenous pathway in a proteasome and TAP-independent fashion are believed to be processed by lysosomal proteases. In fact, the lysosomal protease cathepsin S may be involved in the generation of MHC-I ligands from ovalbumin cross-presented via the TAP-independent vacuolar pathway (266).

# ANTIGEN PROCESSING IN THE MHC-II PATHWAY

The processing of exogenous antigens for presentation on MHC-II molecules occurs within the endocytic pathway. However, our views of how pMHC-II are formed and loaded are still evolving as new regulatory mechanisms continue to emerge, particularly in DCs. One continuing problem has been the identification of the site(s) where antigen processing and peptide loading occur (Figure 6). Lysosomes (or late endosomes) have long been considered obvious candidates from the point of view that they favor digestion of internalized antigens. However, in most

![Diagram of the endocytic pathway](image.png)

Figure 6 The organelles of the endocytic pathway. This figure illustrates the types of common endocytic organelles found in all cell types, including APCs. Most receptor recycling occurs rapidly (t1/2 1–2 min) via recycling endosomes, although a small fraction of recycling receptors (25%) reaches recycling endosomes from which the return to the plasma membrane occurs more slowly (20–30 min). Some transport from recycling endosomes to the Golgi complex may also occur. Ligands and receptors are targeted to lysosomes by being sorted from recycling receptors at the level of early endosomes. They are taken to late endosomes, which accumulate characteristic membrane inclusions (multivesicular bodies or MVBs) and then to lysosomes. This pathway exposes internalized cargo to a progressively lower pH and to higher concentrations of lysosomal hydrolases. Late endosomes and lysosomes probably are in continuous equilibrium with each other, with lysosomes fusing with late endosomes and being regenerated following complete degradation of digestible content. Caveolae mediate internalization to endosomes or to the ER (blue arrows).

cells, lysosomes rapidly cleave protein substrates to amino acids (267). Moreover, membrane transport from lysosomes to the plasma membrane is ordinarily inefficient or slow (268). Endosomes (early or recycling endosomes) provide for efficient recycling, but MHC-II molecules do not normally accumulate in these organelles, where most membrane proteins reside only briefly, perhaps not long enough to permit efficient peptide loading (190).

Work in B cell lines and MO led to the idea that APCs overcome these problems by adaptations of the endocytic pathway, yielding putative specialized loading compartments first designated MIIC (for MHC-II compartments). However, MHC-II-containing compartments in these APCs were found to represent conventional endosomes and lysosomes and are simply the sites to which the bulk of MHC-II and HLA-DM accumulate (269, 270). Although these remain open issues, recent work suggests that DCs also utilize conventional endosomes and lysosomes but regulate their activities to optimize antigen processing (see below) (62). Before considering the sites of antigen processing, however, we should consider the event itself.

## The Order of Events in Antigen Processing: Peptide Generation Versus Peptide Loading

A key question concerning antigen processing in the MHC-II pathway remains unresolved: Are peptides generated first and then loaded, as in the MHC-I pathway, or are peptides generated after binding of intact antigen to MHC-II molecules? Although the first model is widely presumed to be prevalent (in textbooks and nearly all diagrams), it is inherently problematic. Ten- to 15-mer peptides rarely accumulate in endocytic compartments, and certainly not at the concentrations and for the length of time presumably required to bind at equilibrium to MHC-II. Although this may occur, intermediate proteolytic fragments are rare and short lived in the terminal degradative environment of lysosomes.

An alternative model proposes that epitopes could be protected from destruction by binding as large proteins to MHC-II before lysosomal proteases have a chance to degrade them (271–274) (Figure 7). The open binding groove in MHC-II allows the binding to whole proteins or long polypeptides (275–281), and the protruding ends unprotected by MHC-II could be trimmed by endo- and exopeptidases, while the peptides in the MHC-II groove are protected from degradation (276, 282). Some support for this model comes from studies in which long polypeptides were found to co-precipitate with MHC-II molecules, at least in cells whose lysosomes were inactivated by treatment with acidification inhibitors (278, 283). These large polypeptides could then disappear, but whether they were actually the precursors of immunogenic peptides remains unknown.

Thus, the extent to which antigens bind to MHC-II before or after being cleaved remains unclear. A range of possible scenarios exists in which some proteins predominantly bind intact to MHC-II, others require fragmentation before they can bind to MHC-II, and still others experience a bit of both (Figure 7). In fact, examples can be found of proteins that apparently have to be cleaved before they can bind

998 TROMBETTA ■ MELLMAN

![Diagram](#)

Figure 7 Possible pathways for generation of peptide-MHC-II complexes. Pathway I, “peptide capture,” is perhaps the most commonly assumed. It is imagined that protein antigens are first cleaved by lysosomal proteases, and the resulting peptides then bind to MHC-II. In pathway II, “epitope capture,” antigens would bind to MHC-II first, and the protruding ends unprotected by MHC-II would be subsequently trimmed by lysosomal proteases. These two pathways are not necessarily mutually exclusive, and antigens can follow a combination of both pathways I and II. (For further discussions on antigen processing mechanisms, see 15, 274.)

(284). For instance, the epitope 48–60 in HEL presented by I-A<sup>b</sup> is blocked when Arg 61 is present (as in 48–61). This Arg 61 is efficiently removed in the C3H.SW mouse strain but not in the C57BL/6 strain, resulting in its unresponsiveness to HEL48-60, arguing for a role of cleavage at Arg 61 before binding to I-A<sup>b</sup> (285). Although several considerations favor the model in which proteins are trimmed after binding to MHC-II, testing this model directly has been difficult (274).

However, if the “capture” model is indeed prevalent, then lysosomal proteases in APCs may simply be charged with a trimming function, which may not require much specificity. Therefore, the proteases could be quite redundant, raising the question of whether any lysosomal protease is indeed critical for MHC-II presentation. Truly APC-specific proteases have not yet been identified. The lysosomal proteases that have been implicated in the MHC-II pathway (e.g., cathepsins S, L, B, D, and AEP) are often expressed in other tissues at higher levels (197, 286, 287). Most lysosomal proteases are relatively nonspecific, reflecting their primary role in catabolism.

## Biochemistry and Cell Biology of the Processing of the Invariant Chain Versus the Processing of Protein Antigens

The critical role of the invariant chain (Ii) in the MHC-II pathway raised significant interest in elucidating the proteolytic events leading to its degradation, which provides the opportunity to study the cleavage of a substrate common to all APCs (Figure 8). The results are often sought to argue for critical roles for selected proteases, but they could also be taken to indicate a fair amount of

![Diagram](attachment:diagram.png)

**Figure 8** Overview of MHC-II-invariant chain processing. The cleavage of the nonamer Ii-MHC-II complex is typically initiated in endosomes by the cleavage of Ii chain by AEP (legumain) or other unidentified proteases to yield a ~10 kD amino terminal Ii chain fragment termed p10. This fragment, which still contains the endosome-lysosome targeting signal in its cytoplasmic domain, remains as a trimer and interacts with three $\alpha\beta$ dimers. Further cleavage (involving various cathepsins including B, S, or L, depending on the cell types) results in a minimal class II–associated Ii-derived peptide (CLIP) bound to MHC-II. This cleavage is accompanied by the dissociation of the Ii chain-$\alpha\beta$ nonamer to yield three $\alpha\beta$ dimers. CLIP is subsequently exchanged for antigenic peptides, in a reaction favored by acidic pH and facilitated by the MHC-II-like chaperone HLA-DM.

redundancy (16, 288–292). For example, although Ii degradation can be initiated by asparagine-specific endopeptidase (AEP), other proteases can do it as well (293). The redundancy in initiating Ii cleavage is consistent with the difficulty in blocking these early steps using protease inhibitors (16, 288–292) or in AEP⁻/⁻ mice (H. Ploegh, personal communication).

A large body of work has evaluated the role of individual proteases in the final steps of Ii degradation using knockout mice deficient in cathepsins B, S, L, and D. These studies found that complete Ii cleavage is affected in the thymus in the absence of cathepsin L (294), or in B cells and DCs in the absence of cat S (295, 296). The processing of Ii in MØ appeared qualitatively normal in mice deficient in cat L, cat S, or both (297), highlighting how different proteases can participate in cleaving the same substrate. Furthermore, the effects of cat L or cat S deficiency on MHC-II function can be haplotype specific (290). Finally, the accumulation of a nested set of Ii-derived peptides bound to MHC-II in cells lacking H2-M further suggests that in a single cell type the cleavage of Ii is not strictly site specific (181).

These results highlight the difficulties in evaluating the roles of individual lysosomal proteases in antigen processing using protease knockout mice. Even if an antigen is a preferred substrate for a genetically deleted protease, in the absence of that protease the next most likely enzyme might compensate. Also, phenotypes observed in the absence of a protease could be indirect. The lack of a particular protease can affect the stability and maturation of other enzymes. This may further affect the lysosomal environment, for example, by altering the steady-state levels of Ii, which is known to affect antigen presentation (298) and the endocytic system (299).

The apparent lack of specific cleavage requirements for Ii may also extend to the generation of MHC-II ligands. Indeed, Ii is also a good example of how different MHC-II molecules (mouse or human) can bind to the same peptide (CLIP), with different flanking sequences and slightly altered MHC-II topology, and then can be sequentially trimmed by several lysosomal proteases (274, 300). Some antigens may benefit from one or more proteolytic cleavages before they can bind to MHC-II, and in these cases, individual proteases may be important. One such example is the tetanus toxoid C-fragment, which depends on initial Asn-specific cleavage by AEP (301). These results have a straightforward interpretation because they were obtained by modifying cleavage sites in the antigen, without affecting proteolysis in the APC. Legumain (AEP) is an interesting protease for this purpose because it acts well on intact proteins. However, AEP is very specific for cleavage after accessible Asn. Furthermore, surface-exposed Asn are often N-glycosylated in eukaryotes, making them resistant to AEP cleavage (302). Certain antigens can use other “unlocking” proteases: the introduction of a dibasic (Arg-Arg) motif (which is not expected to be a substrate for AEP) enhanced the presentation of HEL (303). Finally, at least for some antigens, denaturation at acid pH or reduction of disulfide bonds in lysosomes may cause sufficient unfolding to permit MHC-II binding without previous cleavage.

Lysosomal Proteolysis and Peptide-MHC-II Formation: Less is More?

Recent evidence indicates that different APCs can exhibit markedly different capacities for lysosomal degradation. Both in culture and in vivo, MØ express high levels of many lysosomal proteases, resulting in a high capacity for lysosomal digestion and allowing MØ to rapidly degrade internalized material (S. Trombetta, unpublished). Such remarkable capacity for lysosomal degradation may be used by MØ to destroy ingested microbes rapidly, serving a key role as a first line of defense. Indeed, such high proteolytic potential is shared by MØ in *Drosophila* (197), suggesting that avid ingestion and digestion by MØ may be evolutionary conserved as a feature of innate immunity.

In contrast, cells expressing high levels of MHC-II, like B cells and DCs, contain much lower levels of lysosomal proteases than MØ, and consequently have a much lower capacity for lysosomal degradation (S. Trombetta, unpublished). This finding may seem counterintuitive because APCs are usually thought to require highly proteolytic lysosomes to ensure cleavage of a broad range of substrates. However, this seemingly counterintuitive finding may actually account for a number of previous observations. Protection from premature lysosomal proteolysis enhanced pMHC-II formation for HEL, ovalbumin, RNase (304), and possibly peptides (185). Low lysosomal proteolysis may also provide better opportunities for modulation of pMHC-II formation by lysosomal pH or protease inhibitors, at least in DCs (see below).

A reduced capacity for lysosomal proteolysis may help to explain early in vitro observations (referred to as “antigenic memory”) that were indeed one of the functional criteria used to identify DCs (19). In several different systems, DCs can generate pMHC complexes, both MHC-II and MHC-I, from antigens internalized up to three days earlier (19–21, 52, 55, 56, 305–308). Low lysosomal proteolysis allows DCs to preserve and disseminate internalized material during their migration to lymphoid organs (197), which may be related to the fact that several days may be required for DCs to journey from peripheral tissues to lymphoid organs (26, 31). If antigens were degraded too rapidly, they might be consumed prematurely or the resultant pMHC complexes might be turned over long before antigens had a chance for presentation to T cells. Furthermore, the reduced capacity for lysosomal proteolysis may play a role in the capacity of DCs to store and subsequently spread HIV (309) and other microbes, both pathological and beneficial (32). This characteristic is not shared by MØ.

DCs can further limit their capacity for proteolysis by expressing various protease inhibitors. These include the Ii p41 isoform (containing a protease inhibitor domain) (310) and members of the cystatin family, especially cystatin C, an exceptionally potent inhibitor of cathepsin S and L, but also of other cysteine proteases (311–313). From proteomic and microarray analysis, cystatin C appears to be a major component of immature DC lysosomes. Mixing experiments have shown the presence of functional protease inhibitors in DC extracts, which are sufficient

to attenuate the lysosomal proteolytic potential from other cell types, including MØ (S. Trombetta, unpublished).

# REGULATION OF ANTIGEN PROCESSING AND PRESENTATION IN THE MHC-II PATHWAY

Recent evidence indicates that pMHC-II formation by DCs can be regulated under physiological conditions. Inflammatory stimuli promote the formation and accumulation of HEL-derived pMHC in vivo (314) and in bone marrow–derived DCs (52, 55, 315). The induction of pMHC-II formation upon DC maturation is accompanied by a generalized activation of lysosomal function (56). The degradation of two different model antigens, HEL and HRP, is enhanced upon DC maturation, suggesting that the general proteolytic capacity in lysosomes is augmented, rather than a few specific cleavage steps of a select antigen. These observations suggest that lysosomal proteolysis could potentially be regulated independently of upregulation of co-stimulation, creating putative immature but active tolerogenic DCs (34).

When analyzed in vitro, both immature and mature DCs exhibited similar capacities for lysosomal proteolysis, indicating that lysosomes in immature DCs maintain conditions in vivo that attenuate their capacity for lysosomal proteolysis (56). The precise mechanism by which proteolysis is activated is unclear, but certain lysosomal proteases are converted to their mature forms (56, 316) or redistributed (316, 317) upon DC maturation. Lysosomal proteases can also be recruited in an orderly manner to maturing phagosomes (318, 319).

However, not all DC populations may exhibit each of these features. Human monocyte-derived DCs, for example, may not induce pMHC-II formation during maturation as much as they stabilize pMHC-II complexes formed at similar rates (308, 320). This stabilization may reflect the greatly reduced rate of MHC-II internalization that occurs in these cells concomitant with the cessation of macropinocytosis upon receipt of a maturation stimulus. Interestingly, monocyte-derived DCs may have protease contents more similar to MØ than to other DC populations (N. McCurley, E.S. Trombetta & I. Mellman, unpublished), suggesting that their lysosomes may not be amenable to as careful regulation and that these cells may have other distinct functional properties.

## The Contribution of Lysosomal pH to the MHC-II Pathway and Its Regulation in APCs

Acidification of endosomes/lysosomes has long been known to be required for efficient antigen processing. Indeed, regulated activation of lysosomal acidification appears to be an important element controlling antigen presentation during DC maturation. The induction of maturation lowers lysosomal pH by ~1 pH unit, from ~pH 5.5 (suboptimal for proteolysis) to pH 4.5 (more adequate pH for proteolysis and peptide loading) (56), providing an attractive explanation for how maturation stimuli might enhance pMHC-II formation by DCs.

Lysosomal acidification can modulate antigen degradation and peptide loading in several ways besides optimizing proteolysis. Lower lysosomal pH may also favor other aspects of pMHC formation, such as binding of peptides or large fragments to MHC-II (321, 322), dissociation of Ii (181, 183, 323, 324), peptide editing by HLA-DM, and enzymatic disulfide reduction by GILT (325). The regulation of lysosomal pH is also a target for some pathogens, such as *Helicobacter* (326) and *Mycobacterium* (327, 328), which raise phagosomal pH, a feature expected to hinder MHC-II presentation.

Elucidating the signaling pathways that regulate acidification in DCs will be interesting because these signals may regulate lysosomal function separately from other hallmarks of DC maturation, such as the upregulation of costimulatory molecules. Such uncoupling may also be effected by alterations in cytokine environment, which has been proposed to affect lysosomal pH (329–331).

The control of lysosomal pH depends on many factors and is primarily due to the influx of H⁺ into the lysosome (332) mediated by the vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) (333, 334). Modulation of lysosomal pH can thus be achieved by regulating the activity of the V-ATPase, which can occur in multiple ways and has been observed from unicellular eukaryotes to mammals (333, 334). One mechanism of V-ATPase activation involves the recruitment of the cytoplasmic sector (V1) onto the membrane-bound VO sector, resulting in a higher proportion of assembled and functional H⁺ pumps (Figure 9). The regulated assembly and activity of the V-ATPase observed in developing DCs (56) has been described in yeast, insects, and vertebrates (335–340). The signals controlling V-ATPase assembly in any of these examples, much less in DCs, are unknown.

## Other Factors Affecting pMHC Formation

Finally, a variety of posttranslational modifications are known to affect antigen processing or T cell recognition. Although the physiological relevance of these may not always be apparent, they do comprise a rich source of heterogeneity that must be considered to understand the immunogenicity of protein antigens.

Tumor cells, for example, can modulate the antigens they present in at least two ways. Downregulation of GILT in melanoma cells, for example, alters the presentation of disulfide-containing peptides on MHC-II (341). In the MHC-I pathway, alterations in the proteasome expression are also used by tumor cells to destroy specific T cell epitopes (85).

In some instances, T cell responses are specific for modified peptides including acetylation (342), isoaspartylation (343), deamidation (344, 345), citrullination (346), phosphorylation (347), glycosylation (342, 348–352), and possibly metal-coordination (353). Identifying the APCs capable of processing the modified proteins, as well as the mechanisms used, will be important (354). For example, DCs may not remove certain glycans, hindering T cell recognition of glycosylated peptides (355).

Thus, a variety of factors affecting the biochemistry of antigen processing and peptide modification contribute to the diversity of pMHC-II complexes. Most of

Figure 9 Schematic representation of regulated proton pump assembly. The pH inside endosomal/lysosomal compartments is regulated primarily by the action of an ATP-dependent proton pump or V-ATPase, a multisubunit complex containing membrane-bound (represented in blue) and peripheral components (represented in yellow) (326, 327). The activity of the V-ATPase can be regulated by multiple mechanisms. In DCs, induction of V-ATPase activity was found to correlate with enhanced assembly triggered by maturation.

these are as yet without known mechanisms and therefore are difficult to predict. Chaperones such as HLA-DO play some, but apparently contradictory, roles at this level (356, 357). It is also clear that specificity and predictability cannot be attributed to specialized protease mechanisms in either the MHC-II or the MHC-I pathways. Understanding antigen processing will likely require a more detailed understanding of its underlying cell biology, where DCs clearly excel at generating specialized or modified mechanisms to handle both antigens and MHC molecules.

## CELL BIOLOGY OF MHC-II FUNCTION IN DENDRITIC CELLS

Like other APCs, DCs do not appear to have cell type-specific endocytic compartments devoted to antigen processing or peptide loading. Rather, they appear to modify the features of otherwise conventional organelles to overcome their inherent limitations (62). We have already considered how alterations in maturation or cytokine environment can control lysosomal acidification and antigen

processing. Another important and unique feature, however, is how highly regulated the traffic of MHC-II molecules is from lysosomal compartments to the plasma membrane (17). This change reflects the contribution of multiple factors, the relative importance of each being likely to vary among different types of DCs.

In mouse bone marrow–derived DCs, newly synthesized MHC-II is largely transported according to the classical pathway first defined in lymphoblastoid and melanoma cells: After leaving the Golgi complex, αβ-Ii complexes are diverted from the constitutive secretory pathway (leading to the surface) and targeted to endocytic organelles, owing to the endosome-lysosome targeting signal found in the Ii cytoplasmic domain. Quantitative surface biotinylation studies suggest that only a minority of each new MHC-II cohort reaches the plasma membrane, but those molecules that do are rapidly internalized and arrive at endosomes as well (307, 358). Endosomes (especially early endosomes; see Figure 6) serve as sorting sites for membrane proteins, and continuously interrogate their cargo to determine which should proceed to the surface, be targeted to the Golgi complex, or be left to proceed to late endosomes/multivesicular bodies (MVBs) and lysosomes. For reasons that are not entirely understood, the latter pathway predominates in immature DCs (Figure 10A). Complete Ii cleavage and dissociation from αβ dimers is affected in the absence of cathepsin S in DCs (and B cells). The activity of this enzyme (and other proteases) is suppressed in immature DCs both by the presence of abundant cystatin C and by the elevated pH found in the endocytic pathway. Indeed, although Ii chain cleavage still occurs, it occurs more slowly (311), with even a slight delay in its removal, probably explaining why the complex is sorted to late endocytic compartments (190). Regulation of cytosolic factors influencing membrane traffic might further promote this pathway.

Upon maturation, newly synthesized MHC-II is targeted directly to the plasma membrane, where it accumulates (Figure 10A). This could easily reflect an increased kinetic efficiency of Ii degradation due to an increase in cathepsin S and lysosomal protease activity in general (56, 311). Indeed, inhibiting cathepsin S activity (pharmacologically or by cystatin C overexpression) redirects new MHC-II to lysosomes, even in fully mature bone marrow–derived DCs. Clearly, however, other factors can be expected to play a role, especially given the dramatic overall reorganization exhibited by maturing DCs. For example, the decrease in macropinocytosis would tend to retain MHC-II at the surface, although some endocytosis might still be expected because of the continued activity of the clathrin-mediated pathway (61).

Human monocyte-derived DCs may use a different mechanism to achieve the same end. Perhaps because protease levels in these cells more closely approximate the higher levels found in MO (see above), regulating MHC-II traffic by controlling Ii processing may be ineffective. Therefore, it appears that a greater cohort of new MHC-II reaches the surface even in immature cells, with the dramatic cessation of endocytosis possibly primarily responsible for achieving the increase in plasma membrane MHC-II at equilibrium (308). This difference may affect the nature of the peptides presented and may also reduce the ability of

monocyte-derived DCs to sequester undigested antigen relative to other DC types, as discussed above.

In general, immature DCs contain abundant MVBs (359–362), classically defined as late endosomes or lysosomes containing internal vesicular inclusions. Interestingly, much of the MHC-II (>75%) found in MVBs is localized to these vesicular inclusions, a priori unexpected because in other cell types this

localization is generally reserved for receptors that are marked for degradation and downregulation (363). Thus, it is remarkable that DCs are capable of recovering even a portion of these MHC-II molecules upon maturation, by triggering the formation of tubular extensions from late endocytic compartments that carry MHC-II to the surface (320, 362), visible by live cell imaging experiments (63, 364) (Figure 10B). Indeed, the MHC-II becomes loaded with immunogenic peptide before activation of this previously unidentified retrograde pathway (52). That the tubules actually fuse with the plasma membrane has been directly demonstrated by total internal reflectance microscopy (63).

The source of the MHC-II molecules in these tubules, however, remains a bit uncertain. Maturation correlates with an apparent reduction in MVB profiles, leading to the suggestion that the internal vesicles fuse with the limiting membrane (362). They may also simply be degraded upon activation of lysosomal protease activity; MVB inclusions are indeed highly sensitive to such digestion in yeast, where they can only be seen in mutant strains affected in lysosomal proteolysis. MVB fusion has been suggested as a trigger for peptide loading because HLA-DM was at first thought to be present predominantly on the late endosome/lysosome limiting membrane (362); however, recent observations suggest that HLA-DM may be equally present on internal and limiting membranes (M. Ebersold, M. Pypaert, S. Trombetta, I. Mellman, unpublished).

In some cases, the pMHC-II-containing MVB compartments could also fuse directly with the plasma membrane of DCs (or other APCs, in this case), releasing the internal inclusions as “exosomes” (365, 366). These vesicles seem to contain many of the components required for T cell stimulation (367, 368) and prime immune responses in vitro and in vivo (369, 370). Exosomes can be released by many cell types, and probably reflect a normal process of lysosomal exocytosis which, in the case of cells such as NK and cytotoxic T cells, controls the release of the lysosome-like granules containing important effector elements (371).

Figure 10 Overview of MHC-II transport in DC. (A) Newly synthesized MHC II-Ii complexes are transported to late endosomes/lysosomes, where they accumulate in immature DCs. At this stage, lysosomes are poorly degradative, owing to the contribution of several factors, including (and most likely not limited to) elevated lysosomal pH and the accumulation of protease inhibitors (such as cystatin C and the p41 form of Ii). Upon maturation, the pH drops, lysosomal proteolysis is increased, and consequently cleavage of Ii and antigens is augmented, resulting in enhanced Ii removal, antigen processing, and peptide loading, followed by transport of MHC-II to the cell surface. (B) Immature DCs contain abundant MVBs, with MHC-II enriched in their internal vesicles. Maturation triggers the formation of tubular extensions from these MVBs that carry MHC-II to the cell surface. The MHC-II-rich internal vesicles either contribute to the process by fusing with the lysosome’s limiting membrane (as proposed but as yet unproved) or are degraded upon the activation of lysosomal hydrolases upon maturation.

PERSPECTIVES

The demonstration of a regulated lysosome-to-plasma membrane pathway solved a major problem in DC biology, and in our understanding of antigen presentation in general. By using the lysosomal compartment as a primary site for antigen processing and peptide loading, DCs use lysosomes' ability to accumulate antigens and other molecules. At the same time, they limit the proteolytic potential of their lysosomes, and even further attenuate it prior to maturation. This arrangement not only ensures sufficient time for the biochemical events associated with pMHC-II formation, but also does so under conditions that are not so harsh as to result in the wanton destruction of potentially rare antigens. The final key was to provide an efficient mode of exit from this compartment, a pathway not commonly found in other cell types. Indeed, lysosome to plasma membrane transport probably does occur in other cell types, even if infrequently. However, the event remained undetected because of the lack of synchrony provided by DC maturation.

Our *leitmotiv* throughout has been considering the importance of applying in vitro results for understanding APC function in vivo. One can anticipate rich heterogeneity among different APC types, and even among different populations of DCs. Such a situation prevents inflexible generalizations, but it does provide insights that will be useful when considering how immune responses are initiated in vivo. Thus, we can now rationalize DC function knowing that they capture and retain antigen, degrading it slowly enough so that individual DCs can generate diverse and stable pMHC complexes that can be carried from the periphery to secondary lymphoid organs. Once there, the cells can then persist or their antigens can be captured by other APCs that might phagocytose incoming DCs or bind the exosomes they release. As a result, the DC has the dual role of not only presenting captured antigens but also disseminating them throughout the immune system. Combined with DCs' exceptional capacities for migration, homing, and expression of costimulatory, adhesion, and immunomodulatory molecules, their role as antigen conveyor is perhaps the most important general element describing their efficiency as initiators of antigen-dependent immunity.

DCs are therefore special in their ability to capture and present antigens. One potential qualitative difference is their capacity for cross-presentation, a feature that enables the DC to present antigens from microbes that may not infect DCs or from differentiated cells that express self-proteins not made by DCs. Apart from this, however, they are not fundamentally different from other APCs. Indeed, the entire logic of the immune response depends on the DC's ability to generate T lymphocytes that can go on to recognize pMHC complexes expressed by other cells, such as B cells, pathogen-infected cells, or tumor cells. DC specializations therefore relate to their unique ability to provide a controlling influence in the immune system, not to accomplish tasks that reflect entirely novel mechanisms in cell biology.
