# Wnts and Wing: Wnt Signaling in Vertebrate Limb Development and Musculoskeletal Morphogenesis

**Yingzi Yang**

In the past twenty years, secreted signaling molecules of the Wnt family have been found to play a central role in controlling embryonic development from hydra to human. In the developing vertebrate limb, Wnt signaling is required for limb bud initiation, early limb patterning (which is governed by several well-characterized signaling centers), and, finally, late limb morphogenesis events. Wnt ligands are unique, in that they can activate several different receptor-mediated signal transduction pathways. The most extensively studied Wnt pathway is the canonical Wnt pathway, which controls gene expression by stabilizing β-catenin in regulating a diverse array of biological processes. Recently, more attention has been given to the noncanonical Wnt pathway, which is β-catenin-independent. The noncanonical Wnt pathway signals through activating Ca²⁺ flux, JNK activation, and both small and heterotrimeric G proteins, to induce changes in gene expression, cell adhesion, migration, and polarity. Abnormal Wnt signaling leads to developmental defects and human diseases affecting either tissue development or homeostasis. Further understanding of the biological function and signaling mechanism of Wnt signaling is essential for the development of novel preventive and therapeutic approaches of human diseases. This review provides a critical perspective on how Wnt signaling regulates different developmental processes. As Wnt signaling in tumor formation has been reviewed extensively elsewhere, this part is not included in the review of the clinical significance of Wnt signaling.

## INTRODUCTION

Vertebrate limb development can be divided roughly into three phases: limb bud initiation, early limb patterning, and late limb morphogenesis (for reviews see Francis-West et al., 2003; Karsenty, 2003; Kronenberg, 2003; Mariani and Martin, 2003; Shum et al., 2003; Tickle, 2003; Zelzer and Olsen, 2003). At the limb initiation stage, lateral plate mesoderm at the fore and hind limb level is induced to grow and form limb buds. Then the formation of the apical ectoderm ridge (AER) is induced by early limb mesoderm. In the early patterning phase, three well-characterized signaling centers coordinate limb patterning and growth along the three axes: AER directs the proximal-distal (P/D) limb outgrowth; the zone of polarizing activity (ZPA) patterns the limb along the anterior-posterior (A/P) axis; and the non-AER limb ectoderm sets up the dorsal-ventral (D/V) polarity (review by Niswander, 2002; Tickle, 2003). In the late limb morphogenesis phase, skeletal elements, muscles, tendons, blood vessels, etc., form and mature to make the limb a functional organ (for review see Karsenty, 2003; Mariani and Martin, 2003). In all these developmental processes, Wnt signaling, either canonical or noncanonical, plays a central role.

The canonical Wnt pathway is composed of evolutionarily-conserved cellular components, and controls cell proliferation and cell fate determination through inducing changes in gene expression (Miller et al., 1999; Huelsken and Behrens, 2002). The key event is regulating β-catenin protein stability through controlling its phosphorylation state (Fig. 1). When Wnts are absent, β-catenin is phosphorylated at the amino-terminus by GSK-3β in a “destruction” complex brought together by axin and adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) in the cytosol. The phosphorylated β-catenin is recognized by an F-box protein β-TrCP that targets β-catenin for degradation (Peifer and Polakis, 2000). When Wnt ligand binds to its receptors Frizzled and LDL receptor related protein 5 or 6 (LRP5/6), Dishevelled (Dsh) is activated, and GSK-3β activity, is suppressed. As a result, β-catenin is not phosphorylated, and β-TrCP cannot target it for degradation. Accumulated β-catenin converts lymphoid enhancer factor (LEF)/TCF from transcription repressor to

activator (Peifer and Polakis, 2000; Chan and Struhl, 2002; Bienz and Clevers, 2003). Thus, in the canonical Wnt pathway, Wnts regulate the level of β-catenin, and hence the transcription mediated by LEF/TCF (Fig. 1).

Our understanding of the canonical Wnt signal transduction has been greatly facilitated by the TOPFLASH luciferase reporter which is a sensitive and specific assay to measure the LEF/TCF-mediated transcription in tissue culture cells (Korinek et al., 1997). Similarly, canonical Wnt signaling reporter mice (TOPGAL or BAT-gal transgenic mice) in which lacZ gene expression is driven by β-catenin/TCF responsive elements, have been developed (DasGupta and Fuchs, 1999; Maretto et al., 2003). These reporter mice have provided useful tools to directly examine the canonical Wnt signaling response in vivo.

It appears that some Wnts signal through noncanonical Wnt pathways that do not lead to β-catenin activation (for review see Veeman et al., 2003a). One important aspect of noncanonical Wnt signaling is to regulate planar cell polarity (PCP) in Drosophila, although it is still not clear whether any Drosophila Wnt ligand is required in this pathway. PCP refers to the polarity of a cell within the plane of the epithelia, for example, the parallel orientation of hairs and bristles on the surface of the fly. Establishing cell polarity is a central biological event. The PCP pathway regulates cell morphology, movement, division, and other functions. In vertebrates, the noncanonical Wnt pathways become more complicated and are involved in a diverse array of developmental processes, such as the gastrulation movement of convergent extension, inner-ear hair-cell stereocilia, dorsal-ventral patterning, tissue separation, and heart induction. Like the PCP pathway in Drosophila, Wnt ligands such as Wnt11 are clearly required in vertebrates during convergent extension (Heisenberg et al., 2000). Intracellularly, the noncanonical Wnt pathways have been shown to activate the C-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), Ca²⁺ flux, and small and possibly trimeric G proteins (Fig. 1). The noncanonical Wnt pathways also require Frizzled as the receptor, but the coreceptor is a proteoglycan protein Knypek (Kny) (Topczewski et al., 2001). In addition, Dsh, which contains the functional domains DIX, PDZ, and DEP, is also involved in transducing the noncanonical Wnt signal. It appears that the function of Dsh differs between the canonical and noncanonical Wnt pathways. First, DIX and PDZ domains are required in the canonical pathway, whereas the PDZ and DEP domains are required in the noncanonical pathway (Axelrod et al., 1998; Boutros et al., 1998; Li et al., 1999; Heisenberg et al., 2000; Tada and Smith, 2000). Second, Dsh is required to be localized to the cell membrane via its DEP domain only in the noncanonical pathway (Axelrod et al., 1998; Wallingford et al., 2000). The canonical and noncanonical signaling pathways further branch out downstream of Dsh, and the underlying mechanism for the noncanonical Wnt pathways is quite diverse (Veeman et al., 2003a). In the PCP pathway, Prickle binds Dsh, which activates JNK and small GTPases such as RhoA to regulate gene expression and cytoskeletal arrangement (Boutros et al., 1998; Habas et al., 2001). During convergent extension movement of the vertebrate embryo, Daam1, which binds both Dsh and RhoA, is required for RhoA activation, whereas Rac activation by Wnts and Dsh does not require Daam1 and may precede JNK activation (Habas et al., 2003) (Fig. 1). In addition, Prickle (Pk) and strabismus (Stbm), two important components in the PCP pathway have been shown to bind each other and they both bind Dsh. These interactions may be im-

important in executing polarized protein localization during PCP signaling (Fig. 1) (Bastock et al., 2003; Jenny et al., 2003; Park and Moon, 2002).

It has been shown that some Wnts, including Wnt5a and Wnt11, can signal through the Wnt/Ca²⁺ pathway that regulates Ca²⁺ flux and calcium sensitive protein kinases and transcription factors such as PKC, CaMKII, and NF-AT (Veeman et al., 2003a). Since a recent study suggests that Dsh, as well as some other components in the PCP pathway, can also stimulate Ca²⁺ flux (Sheldahl et al., 2003), it is likely that there is some overlap between the Wnt/Ca²⁺ pathway and the PCP pathway. In addition, it has been suggested that Wnt5a-activated intracellular Ca²⁺ mobilization may involve a heterotrimeric G protein (Ahumada et al., 2002) (Fig. 1).

Unlike the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, studies of the noncanonical Wnt pathway in development have been hampered by the lack of a robust, specific, and facile functional assay. Assays for the activities of the multiple downstream targets of the noncanonical Wnt pathways, including JNK, Ca²⁺ flux, PKC, CaMKII, and small and heterotrimeric G proteins, are technically challenging. In addition, none of the above targets is specific to any of the noncanonical Wnt pathways. Interestingly, while no Wnt ligand has been found to act in the Drosophila PCP pathway, Wnt5, the Drosophila homologue of vertebrate Wnt5a, which often signals through noncanonical Wnt pathways, has been found to signal through an atypical receptor tyrosine kinase receptor Derailed (Drl) in Drosophila neuronal axon guidance (Yoshikawa et al., 2003). The extracellular domain of Drl and its vertebrate homologue Ryk contains a Wnt inhibitory factor (WIF) domain which binds Wnts (Hsieh et al., 1999). Surprisingly, “core components” of the Wnt pathway Frizzled and Dsh are not required for Wnt5’s activity in axon guidance. Moreover, the orphan tyrosine kinase receptors, Ror1 and Ror2, also contain Frizzled-like Wnt binding

domains in their extracellular part, which has been shown to bind Wnt5a, Wnt11, and Wnt8 (Hikasa et al., 2002; Oishi et al., 2003). Since Ror2⁻/⁻ and Wnt5a⁻/⁻ mice have very similar cartilage developmental defects (Yamaguchi et al., 1999; DeChiara et al., 2000; Takeuchi et al., 2000; Yang et al., 2003), it is a formal possibility that Wnt5a may also signal through the Ror2 receptor. In supporting of this view, XRor2 synergizes with Xwnt5a, Xwnt11, and XFrizzled7 in inhibiting convergent extension in Xenopus embryos (Hikasa et al., 2002).

It has also been shown that different Wnt pathways interact with each other. For instance, the canonical Wnt signaling pathway induces its own inhibitors, Axin2 and Naked Cuticle (Nkd), which bind Dsh and enhance PCP signaling by promoting JNK activation (Zeng et al., 2000; Rousset et al., 2001; Yan et al., 2001a; Jho et al., 2002). On the other hand, some components in the PCP and Wnt/Ca²⁺ pathways inhibit the canonical Wnt signaling pathway (Torres et al., 1996; Park and Moon, 2002). Overexpression of the Xenopus Prickle inhibits TOPFLASH activity in 293 cells (Veeman et al., 2003b). Moreover, we and others have provided the first genetic evidence in vertebrates that Wnt5a signaling can act to inhibit the canonical Wnt signaling in the development of mouse and zebrafish embryos (Topol et al., 2003; Westfall et al., 2003). Our biochemical studies have further demonstrated that Wnt5a signaling can inhibit the canonical Wnt signaling pathway by promoting β-catenin degradation in a GSK-3β independent fashion.

In this review, a critical perspective for the role of Wnt signaling in different aspects of limb development is provided, to illustrate how studies of Wnt signaling in embryonic development, stem cell biology, and mouse and human genetics can be integrated to provide preventive, diagnostic, and therapeutic strategies for human diseases.


WNT SIGNALING DURING LIMB INITIATION

In the developing limb bud, canonical Wnt signaling controls multiple developmental processes. During limb development, limb bud initially forms as a result of interactions between fibroblast growth factor (Fgf) and Wnt signaling, both of which act downstream of the T-box transcription factor Tbx5 and Tbx4 in the developing forelimb and hindlimb, respectively (Agarwal et al., 2003; Naiche and Papaioannou, 2003; Takeuchi et al., 2003). Expression of Fgf10, Lef1, and Tcf1 in the prospective limb field of Tbx5⁻/⁻ embryos is lost, but expression of Tbx5 is intact in Lef1⁻/⁻;Tcf1⁻/⁻ and Fgfr2⁻/⁻ embryos. In addition, embryos of the Fgf10⁻/⁻, Fgfr2⁻/⁻, and Lef1⁻/⁻;Tcf1⁻/⁻ mice do form limb buds, although they are much smaller as compared to the wild-type controls (Xu et al., 1998; Galceran et al., 1999; Sekine et al., 1999), but Tbx5⁻/⁻ and Tbx4⁻/⁻ embryos never form the forelimb bud or the hindlimb bud, respectively. However, Wnt signals act in concert with Tbx5 to activate Fgf10 expression fully in the developing limb bud. Tbx5 alone can activate Fgf10 expression, whereas the canonical Wnt signal sustains high levels of Fgf10 expression during limb initiation (Agarwal et al., 2003).

In the chick limb bud, Wnt2b in the presumptive forelimb region and Wnt8c in the presumptive hindlimb region, are shown to signal through β-catenin/TCF to maintain the expression of Fgf10 in the lateral plate mesoderm (LPM) at the presumptive limb level (Kawakami et al., 2001). However, similar expression patterns for Wnt2b, Wnt8c, and other Wnts with similar functions at the limb initiation stage were not detected in the mouse embryo (Agarwal et al., 2003). Therefore, it is not clear, at least in the mouse embryo, whether any Wnt ligand expressed in the early LPM or intermediate mesoderm before limb bud formation is required for limb initiation. In fact, none of the previous publications could rule out the possibility that the Wnt ligand responsible for canonical Wnt

mouse embryos results in a phenotype similar to that caused by limb ectoderm specific removal of Wnt3. The difference in Wnt3 response between the dorsal versus ventral limb ectoderm is consistent with the notion that AER induction and proper positioning requires proper D/V juxtaposition of the limb bud ectoderm (Cygan et al., 1997; Loomis et al., 1998; Kimmel et al., 2000). However, the dorsal ectoderm is competent to respond to the canonical Wnt signaling pathway to activate AER formation, since ectopic expression of Wnt3a or activated β-catenin in chick or mouse limb buds leads to ectopic formation of AER on both the dorsal and ventral ectoderm (Kengaku et al., 1998; Barrow et al., 2003). Therefore, it appears that stronger Wnt signaling is required for AER formation in the dorsal ectoderm, possibly due to the presence of dorsal specific inhibitors or ventral specific activators of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway.

AER formation is intimately linked to D/V patterning of the limb ectoderm. Because canonical Wnt signaling is also required upstream of Engrailed 1(En1) in the ventral ectoderm for determining the ventral limb identity (Galceran et al., 1999; Barrow et al., 2003), the AER formation defects in the limb-specific mutants of Wnt3 or β-catenin might be a result of a failure to pattern the ventral ectoderm properly. This hypothesis is consistent with the observation that formation of the mature AER involves the convergence of broadly distributed ventral precursor cells towards the D/V boundary of the limb field; expression of AER marker genes such as Fgf8 are initially observed in a broad domain of thickened ventral ectoderm (the pre-AER), and progressively become restricted to the mature AER at the distal margin in the mouse (Crossley and Martin, 1995; Mahood et al., 1995; Michaud et al., 1997; Loomis et al., 1998). In addition, this hypothesis predicts that activated canonical Wnt signaling is not able to promote AER formation in the absence of proper D/V patterning in the limb. However, when a constitutively active β-catenin

Figure 2. Canonical Wnt signaling regulates limb initiation and AER induction. Tbx4/5 is expressed in the lateral plate mesoderm (LPM) prior to the expression of Fgf10, Lef1, and Tcf1. Tbx4/5 directly activates Fgf10 expression and possibly indirectly activates Wnt3 expression in the surface ectoderm (SE). Fgf10 and Wnt3 may form a positive feedback loop to achieve a high expression level required for limb bud outgrowth and AER induction. At this stage, Wnt3 signaling in regulating Fgf10 expression is mediated by Lef1 and Tcf1. Wnt3 signaling in the ectoderm itself leads to AER induction and Fgf8 expression. Once Fgf8 is induced, it joins the Wnt3/Fgf positive feedback loop by forming a positive feedback loop with Fgf10. This new Wnt3/Fgf positive feedback loop is required for AER maintenance and P/D limb outgrowth.

signaling during limb initiation is secreted from the surface ectoderm. Since Tbx5 and Fgf10, as well as Wnt3, are initially expressed in a broader area than just the presumptive limb bud, it is likely that Tbx5 also indirectly activates Wnt3 expression. This may be further strengthened by Fgf10 signaling through a positive feedback loop between Wnt3 and Fgf10 (Fig. 2). Indeed, it has been shown that Wnt3 is required for limb initiation (Barrow et al., 2003). Removal of Wnt3 activity in the limb ectoderm phenocopies the limb phenotype of the Fgf10−/− and the Lef1−/−;Tcf1−/− mice, which likely lack all canonical Wnt activity in the presumptive limb region. As both Lef1 and Tcf1 are expressed in the limb mesoderm, it is possible that Wnt3 expressed in the limb ectoderm signals both within the ectoderm to induce AER formation and in the limb mesoderm to promote Fgf10 expression (Fig. 2). Alternatively, Fgf10 acts through activating and maintaining Wnt3 expression in AER induction, which is in agreement with a prevailing view. Further examination of whether Wnt3 expression depends on Tbx4/5, Fgf10, or whether expression of activated β-catenin in the ventral ectoderm can still induce AER formation in the absence of Fgf10, will provide more insight into the signaling cascade during limb initiation and AER formation.

AER, a specialized ectodermal structure, is induced at the junction between the dorsal and ventral ectoderm at the distal end of the limb, slightly after limb bud formation, and produces growth factors such as Fgf8 and Fgf4 to promote P/D limb outgrowth. Fgf8, a downstream target of Wnt3/β-catenin signaling in the AER, forms a positive feedback loop with Fgf10. This feedback loop is essential for P/D limb outgrowth (Fig. 2). Strong LacZ expression is observed in the AER in the canonical Wnt signaling reporter mice BAT-gal and TOPGAL, consistent with the requirement for canonical Wnt signaling in AER formation (Maretto et al., 2003; Topol et al., 2003). The Wnt ligand required in this process is Wnt3 in mouse and Wnt3a in chick (Kengaku et al., 1998; Barrow et al., 2003). Although the initially broader Wnt3a expression is quickly restricted to the AER region in the chick, Wnt3 expression is ubiquitously expressed throughout the limb ectoderm. However, Wnt3 signaling is only required in the ventral limb ectoderm for AER formation (Barrow et al., 2003). As AER derives from early ventral ectoderm (Michaud et al., 1997; Bell et al., 1998; Loomis et al., 1998), removal of β-catenin activity specifically in the ventral ectoderm in the

canonical Wnt signaling pathway. In this regard, removal of β-catenin specifically in the early dorsal ectoderm prior to AER formation will provide more insight.

## WNT SIGNALING IN LIMB PATTERNING

In the second phase of limb development, when three signaling centers are established, AER is required directly for P/D limb outgrowth and patterning. It also indirectly maintains Shh expression in the ZPA through a positive feedback loop between Shh and Fgf4, expressed in the AER (Lauf er et al., 1994; Niswander et al., 1994; Yang and Niswander, 1995b; Zuniga et al., 1999). In addition, canonical Wnt signaling is required at this time for AER maintenance. First, the AER forms, but is not maintained, when β-catenin is ablated slightly later in limb development (Barrow et al., 2003). Second, AER activity and structure change in response to alterations of the canonical Wnt signaling. Dkk1 encodes a secreted antagonist specific for the canonical Wnt pathway and is expressed in the AER in the developing limb bud (Mao et al., 2001a; Mukhopadhyay et al., 2001; Semenov et al., 2001). In the Dkk1−/− mouse embryo, Fgf8 expression in the AER is stronger, and is expanded both dorsally and ventrally in the limb bud as a result of upregulated canonical Wnt signaling (Mukhopadhyay et al., 2001). In addition, Lrp6 is a Wnt coreceptor required for the canonical Wnt signaling (Pinson et al., 2000; Tamai et al., 2000; Wehrli et al., 2000). In the Lrp6−/− embryo, Fgf8 expression is significantly reduced, indicating that AER degenerates prematurely as a result of weakened canonical Wnt signaling (Pinson et al., 2000; Maretto et al., 2003). All these results demonstrate that after AER formation, proper modulation of the canonical Wnt signaling strength is required to maintain normal function and structure of the AER (Fig. 3A).

Wnt7a in the limb ectoderm signals to the mesoderm underneath to maintain dorsal cell fates and

**Figure 3.** Wnt3 and Wnt7a signaling regulate early limb patterning. **A:** A posterior view of a limb bud. Wnt3 signaling in the AER is modulated by its antagonist Dkk1 and is required for AER maintenance and Fgf8 expression. In addition, Wnt7a signaling from the dorsal ectoderm also regulates Shh expression in the ZPA. Since there is a positive feedback loop between Shh and Fgf4 expressed in the AER, Wnt7a signaling also indirectly affects A/P and P/D patterning. **B:** A schematic section of the limb bud along the dorsal-ventral axis. Wnt7a signals to the distal limb mesoderm to determine the dorsal limb identity by activating the expression of *Lmx1b*. DE: dorsal ectoderm; VE: ventral ectoderm.

(ΔNβ-catenin) is expressed in the dorsalized mouse limb caused by ablation of BMPRIA in the ventral ectoderm, ectopic expression of AER marker (*Fgf8*) is activated as in the wild-type limb, but the D/V patterning defect is not rescued (Soshnikova et al., 2003). These results demonstrate that AER formation and D/V patterning by the canonical Wnt signaling are independent of each other.

Another ectoderm-derived Wnt ligand that may play a role in AER formation is Wnt7a. Unlike Wnt3, Wnt7a is expressed specifically in the dorsal limb ectoderm and the most important role of Wnt7a is D/V patterning by controlling the expression of *Lmx1b*, which encodes a LIM-homeodomain transcription factor that determines the dorsal mesodermal cell fate in the limb (Parr et al., 1993; Parr and McMahon, 1995; Riddle et al., 1995; Chen et al., 1998). This is discussed later. Endogenous AER formation is normal in the Wnt7a−/− mouse limb (Parr and McMahon, 1995). But in the *En1*−/− limb bud, ectopic AER forms at the border of Wnt7a-expressing and nonexpressing cells and Wnt7a is required for such ectopic AER formation (Cygan et al., 1997). In addition, ectopic juxtaposition of dorsal and ventral limb ectoderm induces AER formation (Tanaka et al., 1997). Furthermore, ectopic expression of *En1* and an AER marker, *Fgf8*, are induced by ectopic BMP signaling only in the dorsal ectoderm in nonoverlapping, but adjacent domains (Pizette et al., 2001), highlighting the importance of D/V ectoderm juxtaposition in AER formation. In contrast, Wnt7a signaling in the limb mesoderm does not seem to be involved in AER formation, since AER formation is normal in the ventralized *Lmx1b*−/− limb. These results raise the possibility that Wnt7a may also signal within the dorsal ectoderm to establish differential response to Wnt3 signaling in the dorsal and ventral ectoderm, ultimately leading to AER formation at the D/V boundary. This activity of Wnt7a during limb initiation may be redundant with that of another Wnt in the surface ectoderm, supported by the observation that *Lmx1b* expression in the early limb bud is not altered in the absence of Wnt7a, and explains why endogenous AER formation does not require Wnt7a (Parr and McMahon, 1995; Cygan et al., 1997). It is not clear whether this ectoderm-specific activity of Wnt7a is transduced through the

Birth Defects Research (Part C) 69:305–317, (2003)

Shh expression in the distal limb bud (Fig. 3A, B) (Parr and McMahon, 1995; Riddle et al., 1995; Yang and Niswander, 1995a; Cygan et al., 1997). The dorsalizing activity of Wnt7a in the limb mesoderm is mediated through a noncanonical Wnt pathway, as loss of β-catenin or LEF1/TCF1 in the limb result in dorsalized limb and ventrally extended *Lmx1b* expression (Galec- ran et al., 1999; Barrow et al., 2003; Soshnikova et al., 2003). However, Wnt7a signaling in regulating Shh expression is independent of its dorsalizing activity (Chen et al., 1998), as Shh expression was normal in the *Lmx1b⁻/⁻* limb. Since the expression of Axin2 and Nkd, both are transcription targets and antagonists of the canonical Wnt signaling, shows clear dorsal preference in the limb mesoderm (Wharton et al., 2001; Yan et al., 2001b; Jho et al., 2002; Leung et al., 2002; Lustig et al., 2002; Soshnikova et al., 2003), it will be interesting to investigate whether Axin2 and Nkd expression depends on Wnt7a or β-catenin signaling and whether any of them are involved in D/V patterning, Shh expression, or the establishment of the difference between dorsal and ventral ectoderm in response to Wnt3 signaling.

WNT SIGNALING IN MYOBLAST DIFFERENTIATION IN THE LIMB.

Muscle cells in the limb differentiate from premyogenic cells migrated from the lateral dermomyotome, where they are born (for review see Dietrich, 1999; Buckingham et al., 2003). These premyogenic cells are specified by Wnts secreted from the nearby neural tube and the overlying surface ectoderm through induction of Pax3 (Munsterberg et al., 1995), likely via the canonical signaling pathway (Polesskaya et al., 2003). It has been shown that FGFs and Scatter factor (SF), also called hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) in the lateral plate mesoderm, signal to the somite in regulating epithelial to mesenchymal transition of the lateral dermomyotome and subsequent directional migration of these muscle precursors towards the limb bud, which are controlled by Pax3 and *Lbx1*, respectively (reviewed by Birchmeier and Brohmann, 2000; Buckingham, 2001). It has recently been shown that the expression of *Lbx1*, hence the ability of the myogenic precursor cells to migrate into the limb, is controlled by both intrinsic and extrinsic cues (Alvares et al., 2003). The intrinsic cues are provided by the signals that pattern the A/P body axis, whereas the extrinsic cues come from the developing limb bud (Mennerich et al., 1998). However, the extrinsic signal, identified as Fgf4 in the AER (Alvares et al., 2003), appears to act through reprogramming of the intrinsic A/P patterning in the axial mesoderm. It is still not clear whether there is any other signaling factor in the limb AER that also activates *Lbx1* expression. As Wnts expressed in the limb ectoderm have been shown to induce NT-3 in the underlying mesenchyme, Wnts may regulate axonal growth and guidance by controlling NT-3 expression in the limb (Patapoutian et al., 1999). Although Wingless signaling might be involved in the regulation of *Lbx* expression in *Drosophila* (Jagla et al., 1997), there is no report so far that Wnt factors from the limb surface ectoderm are also playing a role in *Lbx1* expression and muscle migration.

Once the premyogenic cells enter the limb, they start myogenic differentiation by turning off the expression of Pax3 and *Lbx1*, and activating the expression of myogenic regulatory factors (MRF) Myf5 and *MyoD*. There is compelling evidence indicating the requirement of canonical Wnt signaling in the induction of myogenic differentiation in the limb. First, Wnt proteins are sufficient and necessary to activate Myf5 and *MyoD* expression and muscle cell differentiation in explants of mouse paraxial mesoderm, as well as adult stem cells (Tajbakhsh et al., 1998; Polesskaya et al., 2003). Second, β-catenin is sufficient and necessary for myogenic differentiation of the pluripotent embryonic carcinoma p19 cells (Petropoulos and Skerjanc, 2002). Third, blocking canonical Wnt signaling leads to reduction in myocyte numbers in the chick limb bud (Anakwe et al., 2003). However, as the Wnt ligand responsible for such myogenic activity has not been identified in the limb, it remains possible that myocyte differentiation of the Pax3-expressing premyogenic cells in the limb occurs independently of, or is even inhibited by, the canonical Wnt signaling. This has been supported by studies in the myogenic cell lines L8, C2, and its derivative (Martin et al., 2002; Goichberg et al., 2001), in which increased β-catenin activity inhibits, whereas reduced β-catenin promotes, myocyte differentiation. It is possible that the exact function of β-catenin depends on the cellular context and varies at different myogenic stages. Removal of β-catenin in the Pax3-expressing cells in the limb in a timely controlled manner will help to clarify this issue.

Myoblasts terminally differentiate into slow or fast muscle fibers that have different metabolic activities and contain different isoforms of myofibrillar contractile proteins, such as myosin heavy chain (MHC). The specific combination of slow and fast muscle fibers in each muscle determines its function. Recent cell labeling experiments in chick limb bud indicated that specific

The result of a complex network of signaling events governing growth and patterning in the second phase is the determination of position and morphology of individual limb structures, including muscles, tendons, and skeletal elements. For instance, these limb structures always change in accordance with alterations in the D/V or A/P patterning of the limb as a result of manipulating Wnt7a, En1, β-catenin, or Shh signaling. However, Wnts, as well as other signaling molecules, also act "locally" to control the morphogenesis of a specific tissue in the limb such as musculature, synovial joint, cartilage, and bone without affecting the global patterning of the limb.

**Figure 4.** Wnt signaling regulates late events of limb morphogenesis. **A:** Schematic section of a limb bud, sectioned along the D/V axis. Different Wnts exhibit distinct expression patterns in the limb ectoderm and mesoderm, and have different activities in myoblast and chondrocyte differentiation. Wnts that can transduce their signals through the canonical pathway, such as Wnt3, Wnt10a, and Wnt10b, are expressed in the ectoderm and AER. Canonical Wnt signaling regulates myoblast differentiation, and its exact function appears to be both dose-dependent and stage-dependent (see text). Wnt11 is expressed in the periphery of the limb mesoderm, which supports slow muscle fiber differentiation. Wnt5a is expressed as a gradient in the limb mesoderm, with the strongest expression seen in the distal limb. Wnt5a may signal through CaMKII to promote fast muscle fiber differentiation. Wnt5a also promotes chondrogenesis in the distal limb by inhibiting canonical Wnt signaling, which suppresses chondrogenic differentiation. DE: dorsal ectoderm; VE: ventral ectoderm. **B:** Wnt signaling regulates synovial joint formation. In a newly formed cartilage element, Wnt14, as well as Wnt4 and Wnt5, are expressed in the interzone, which will form the synovial joint. These Wnts, and Gdf5, which is a key player in joint formation, are also expressed around the cartilage. Only Wnt14, when ectopically expressed, can induce ectopic Gdf5 expression and ectopic joint formation. **C:** Schematic sections of a developing long bone in the limb. Morphology is shown on the left, and gene expression and regulation are shown on the right. Wnt5a and Wnt5b coordinate the transition between different chondrocyte zones that have characteristic cell morphology and proliferation/differentiation properties. Wnt5a inhibits whereas Wnt5b enhances the activity of Sox9. Wnt5a inhibits the transition from Zone I to Zone II, but promotes chondrocyte hypertrophy by inhibiting CyclinD1 expression, but promoting high levels of p130 expression. Wnt5b, on the other hand, inhibits chondrocyte hypertrophy by promoting CyclinD1 expression and inhibiting p130 expression. Lrp5 is expressed in the periosteum and trabecular bone, and plays a critical role in determining bone mass by promoting osteoblast proliferation and terminal differentiation.

tion of slow and fast myotubes involves both extrinsic and intrinsic mechanisms (Kardon et al., 2002). Furthermore, Wnt family members such as Wnt5a and Wnt11 may be involved in instructing the determination of the fate of slow and fast muscle fibers, likely through noncanonical pathways (Anakwe et al., 2003). In the developing chick limb, Wnt11 is expressed in the peripheral mesoderm of the limb, where differentiation of slow muscle fiber is supported. Overexpression of Wnt11 promotes slow fiber differentiation at the expense of fast fibers, whereas overexpression of Wnt5a or activated CaMK II has the opposite effect (Fig. 4A). Further investigation of muscle fiber specification in the Wnt11−/− or Wnt5a−/− mouse embryos will be necessary to test whether Wnt11 or Wnt5a is required for slow versus fast muscle fiber specification.

The ability to induce stem cells to differentiate into a specific cell type has tremendous impact on tissue engineering and repairing. The recent finding that adult muscle stem cells are induced to differentiate into myoblasts by canonical Wnt signaling shows that the generation and regeneration of skeletal muscles are governed by a common mechanism (Polelskaya et al., 2003). As modulation of the canonical Wnt pathway may enhance myogenic differentiation of the adult stem cells, a better understanding of how Wnt signaling regulates muscle development in the limb will provide more effective therapeutic strategies for the treatment of neuromuscular diseases.

### WNT SIGNALING IN LONG BONE DEVELOPMENT

Long bone formation in the developing limb is controlled by a mechanism termed endochondral ossification, in which mesenchymal cells first condense, and then differentiate into chondrocytes and osteoblasts, to form the future cartilage and bone. Wnt signaling controls several key developmental processes during skeletal morphogenesis in the limb: differentiation of chondrocytes from mesenchymal

Birth Defects Research (Part C) 69:305–317, (2003)

condensations; joint formation between different skeletal segments; and lastly, proliferation and maturation of chondrocytes and osteoblasts.

The multi-step process of endochondral bone formation starts with the chondrogenic differentiation from mesenchymal progenitors by forming cell condensation. It has been shown that canonical Wnt signaling acts to suppress chondrocyte differentiation from such condensed mesenchymal progenitors (Rudnicki and Brown, 1997; Hartmann and Tabin, 2001; Tufan and Tuan, 2001), and expression of Wnt1, Wnt7a, Wnt14, and the constitutively active β-catenin, all lead to inhibition of chondrocyte differentiation. Conversely, we have found that Wnt5a may promote chondrocyte differentiation in the distal limb bud by inhibiting the canonical Wnt activity (Topol et al., 2003). Strongest Wnt5a expression is observed at the distal limb bud (Fig. 4A) (Yamaguchi et al., 1999). In the Wnt5a−/− mouse embryo, chondrogenesis in the distal limb is inhibited as a result of elevated canonical Wnt signaling (Topol et al., 2003). However, it is not clear how chondrogenic differentiation is suppressed by canonical Wnt signaling. Mesenchymal condensation is marked by upregulation of N-cadherin expression, which is subsequently downregulated when overt chondrocyte differentiation starts (Oberlender and Tuan, 1994b). Perturbation of N-cadherin function resulted in impaired cell condensation and chondrogenesis, both in vitro and in vivo (Oberlender and Tuan, 1994a). In addition, overexpression of wild-type N-cadherin enhances mesenchymal condensation and chondrocyte differentiation, whereas mutant forms of N-cadherin lacking either the extracellular domain or the cytoplasmic domain decreases cell condensation and chondrocyte differentiation (DeLise and Tuan, 2002). Furthermore, Sox9, a transcription factor with a high-mobility group (HMG-box) DNA-binding domain, is required for chondrocyte cell fate determination, as mouse limbs lacking Sox9 fail to form chondrocytes (Akiyama et al.,

2002). Sox9 is initially expressed in condensed mesenchyme and later in all chondrocytes except hypertrophic chondrocytes (Ng et al., 1997; Zhao et al., 1997; Akiyama et al., 2002). However, the exact intracellular pathways through which Wnt signaling and N-cadherin regulate Sox9 expression and chondrocyte differentiation are still unknown, although there are indications that MAP kinase activation and the AP-1 transcription complex are involved (Tufan et al., 2002). Since β-catenin binds N-cadherin, it is possible that N-cadherin may signal through interfering with the canonical Wnt signaling in chondrogenic mesenchymal condensations. A better understanding of how the onset of Sox9 expression is controlled will provide much insight into the regulation of mesenchymal condensation and chondrocyte lineage specification.

In the developing limb, shortly after the chondrocytes arise, cartilage elements elongate by chondrocyte proliferation and by recruitment of newly differentiated chondrocytes along the longitudinal axis. Elongation appears to be correlated with differentiation of the perichondrium along the periphery of the cartilage element, where osteoblasts are born. Cartilage elongation is followed by branching and segmentation to form additional skeletal elements (Cohn et al., 2002). For instance, branching and segmentation of the humerus lead to radius and ulna formation. Wnt14 has been implicated as playing a central role in initiating synovial joint formation in the chick limb (Hartmann and Tabin, 2001). Wnt14 is expressed in joint-forming interzone cells prior to cartilage segmentation (Fig. 4B). Ectopic expression of Wnt14 in the chick limb bud induced morphologic and molecular changes in chondrocytes characteristic of the first steps of joint formation, such as the expression of Gdf5 (Storm et al., 1994; Storm and Kingsley, 1996). However, as several other Wnts such as Wnt4 and Wnt5a are also expressed in the future joint region (Church et al., 2002), it will be interesting to find out which Wnt(s)

and which Wnt pathway are required in synovial joint induction. Wnt signaling has also been implicated in degenerative joint diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (Sen et al., 2000, 2001, 2002). Wnt14 expression in the synovial joint persists for a long time until after birth (Hartmann and Tabin, 2001). In addition, mutations in the WISP3 gene, which encodes for Wnt1-induced signaling protein (WISP) subfamily of the connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) family, are associated with the autosomal recessive skeletal disorder progressive pseudorheumatoid dysplasia (PPD) (Hurvitz et al., 1999). PPD patients typically develop signs and symptoms of disease in their early childhood and experience continued cartilage loss and destructive bone changes as they age. Cartilage appears to be the primary affected tissue, as abnormal chondrocyte organization in the growth zones were observed. However, further investigation is needed to test whether modulation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling results in degenerative joint symptoms, and whether such changes are caused by altering the expression of Wisp3 in chondrocytes. Further understanding of the function and signaling mechanism of Wnt14 in joint formation, and chondrocyte differentiation in vivo will provide more insight, not only in the development of synovial joints, but also in their maintenance, which will have significant impact on the prevention and treatment of both rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis.

In cartilage, differentiated chondrocytes execute a tightly controlled developmental program that includes unidirectional proliferation, conversion to hypertrophic chondrocytes, extracellular matrix calcification, and cell death, which is followed by trabecular bone formation (Fig. 4C). At the molecular level, a number of secreted polypeptides, such as Ihh, PTHrP, BMPs, FGF18, and Wnts, are known to cooperatively regulate rates of chondrocyte proliferation, hypertrophy, and osteoblast differentiation in the perichondrium/periosseum (reviewed by Kronenberg,

Birth Defects Research (Part C) 69:305–317, (2003)

2003). Ihh, expressed in prehypertrophic chondrocytes, was initially identified as a key regulator for chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation (Vortkamp et al., 1996). Later, it was also found to be required for the expression of Cbfal, which encodes a Runt domain transcription factor required for osteoblast differentiation (Ducy et al., 1997; Komori et al., 1997; Otto et al., 1997; St-Jacques et al., 1999). Thus, chondrocyte differentiation is intimately linked to osteoblast differentiation. It is still not clear whether canonical Wnt signaling is required for regulating chondrocyte proliferation or differentiation, as all published results are derived from overexpression experiments. Expression of β-catenin is high in prechondrogenic mesenchymal cells, but significantly decreased in differentiated chondrocytes, both in vivo and in vitro (Ryu et al., 2002). If constitutively active β-catenin is overexpressed in cultured chick chondrocytes, the chondrocyte phenotype, such as expression of Sox9 and ColII is lost. But, in the developing chick limb bud, overexpression of Wnt4 or a constitutively active β-catenin promotes chondrocyte hypertrophy (Hartmann and Tabin, 2000), whereas expression of a Wnt antagonist, Frzb-1, resulted in delayed chondrocyte hypertrophy (Enomoto-Iwamoto et al., 2002). Moreover, the overexpression results in chick do not seem to agree with the loss of function genetic results in mice. It appears that chondrocyte hypertrophy is delayed in the Dkk1−/− mouse limb in which the canonical Wnt signaling is elevated (Mukhopadhyay et al., 2001). It is likely that these discrepancies may simply reflect the fact that the function of canonical Wnt signaling in differentiated chondrocytes is stage- and dose-dependent, and that overexpressed Frzb-1 may have blocked several different Wnt pathways.

In contrast to canonical Wnt signaling, Wnt5a, apparently through a noncanonical pathway, is required for coordinating chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation to ensure longitudinal long bone growth (Yang et al., 2003). When overexpressed in the mouse chondrocytes, the effects of Wnt5a and an activated β-catenin are distinct (Yang, unpublished results). Proliferative chondrocytes can be divided into two zones, Zone I and Zone II, according to their morphology and proliferative rate (Fig. 4C). Zone I and II proliferation state is correlated with the expression of key cell cycle regulators. p130, a retinoblastoma (Rb) family member that inhibits G1/S transition, is highly expressed in Zone I articular/resting chondrocytes, whereas Cyclin D1, which promotes G1/S transition, is highly expressed in Zone II. Wnt5a is expressed in Zone II and perichondrium/periosseum. We have found that Wnt5a signaling acts to inhibit chondrocyte proliferation and Sox9 activity. As a result, Wnt5a inhibits the transition from slowly proliferating articular/resting cells to fast proliferating columnar chondrocytes, and is necessary for chondrocyte hypertrophy, which requires cell cycle exit (Yang et al., 2003). Interestingly, Wnt5b, a close relative of Wnt5a, is expressed in chondrocytes that have already exited the cell cycle and exhibit opposite activities in regulating Sox9 activity and chondrocyte proliferation (Fig. 4C). Since Wnt5a signaling activates CaMKII, and we have shown that Wnt5a signaling promotes β-catenin degradation (Topol et al., 2003), it will be interesting to investigate whether canonical Wnt signaling activity is elevated to a certain extent in the Wnt5a−/− chondrocytes, and whether reduced canonical Wnt signaling or activated CaMKII in chondrocytes can rescue the cartilage phenotype in Wnt5a−/− mouse embryos.

It is interesting to note that the cartilage phenotype in the Ror2−/− embryo is almost identical to that observed in the Wnt5a−/− embryo (Yamaguchi et al., 1999; DeChiara et al., 2000; Takeuchi et al., 2000; Yang et al., 2003), which suggests that Ror2 may transduce the Wnt5a signal in chondrocytes, as has been indicated in some other systems (Hikasa et al., 2002; Oishi et al., 2003). Mutations in Ror2 have been shown to cause human congenital skeletal malformations such as the autosomal recessive Robinow syndrome and autosomal dominant brachydactyly type B (Afzal et al., 2000; Oldridge et al., 2000; Schwabe et al., 2000; van Bokhoven et al., 2000). It is likely that mutations disrupting Wnt5a signaling may also cause birth defects with severe skeletal dysplasia, similar to Robinow syndrome or brachydactyly type B.

In contrast to chondrocytes, the canonical Wnt signaling pathway is clearly required for osteoblast proliferation and terminal differentiation. LRP5, which encodes a coreceptor in transducing the canonical Wnt signaling (Mao et al., 2001b), is expressed in early differentiated osteoblasts at sites undergoing either membranous or endochondral ossification. LRP5 expression is not detected in chondrocytes (Fig. 4C) (Gong et al., 2001; Kato et al., 2002). Studies of human patients with the autosomal recessive disorder osteoporosis-pseudoglioma syndrome (OPPG) demonstrate that LRP5 is important for the establishment of peak bone mass (Gong et al., 2001). In addition, Lrp5−/− mice exhibit bone phenotypes similar to those observed in OPPG patients. It has been shown in these mice that osteoblast terminal differentiation is delayed, and osteoblast proliferation is reduced (Kato et al., 2002). Furthermore, a mutation in human LRP5, LRP5V171, was identified as the cause of high bone density (HBM), by impairing the action of Dkk, an antagonist of the Wnt pathway, thus increasing Wnt signaling (Boyden et al., 2002; Little et al., 2002). These findings demonstrate that LRP5-mediated canonical Wnt signaling is required for regulating bone mass. As the OPPG patients with deficient trabecular bone volume have normal surface density and the presence of osteoblasts and osteoclasts in bone surfaces, it appears that the canonical Wnt signaling may not be required for osteoblast cell fate determination. However, this needs to be taken with caution. First, canonical Wnt signaling promotes osteoblastic differentiation from mesenchymal

Birth Defects Research (Part C) 69:305–317, (2003)

progenitor cells in vitro (Gong et al., 2001; Bain et al., 2003). Second, LRP6, which is expressed ubiquitously, is closely related to LRP5 (Pinson et al., 2000), and both are upregulated in a similar fashion during in vitro osteoblastic differentiation (Gong et al., 2001). It is very likely that loss of LRP5 function can be compensated by LRP6 to a certain extent, and that there is still residual canonical Wnt signaling in LRP5⁻/⁻ osteoblasts. Therefore, complete ablation of the canonical Wnt signaling in osteoprogenitor cells will be necessary to address whether it is required for osteoblast cell fate differentiation.

In humans, low peak bone mass is a significant risk factor for osteoporosis, which is the most common degenerative disease that affects large populations worldwide, thus having great impact in bone biology research (Riggs and Melton, 1986; Karsenty, 2003). LRP5-mediated Wnt signaling appears to have specific function in regulating bone density. Human individuals with mutations in LRP5 have abnormal bone densities (Gong et al., 2001; Boyden et al., 2002; Little et al., 2002; Patel and Karsenty, 2002; Van Wesenbeeck et al., 2003), but are otherwise healthy. Therefore, LRP5 represents a highly promising pharmacological target for developing new drugs, with low toxicity and minimal side effects, for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis.
