T-cell transformation by the human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I) involves deregulation of cellular transcription factors, including members of the NF-κB family. In normal T cells, NF-κB activation occurs transiently in response to immune stimuli, which is required for antigen-stimulated T-cell proliferation and survival. However, HTLV-I induces persistent activation of NF-κB, causing deregulated expression of a large array of cellular genes, which in turn contributes to the induction of T-cell transformation. The HTLV-I transforming protein Tax functions as an intracellular stimulator of IkB kinase (IKK), a cellular kinase mediating NF-κB activation by diverse stimuli. Tax physically interacts with IKK and renders this inducible kinase constitutively active. By assembling different Tax/IKK complexes, Tax targets the persistent activation of both canonical and noncanonical NF-κB signaling pathways. Whereas Tax plays a primary role in HTLV-I-mediated NF-κB activation, recent studies reveal that the IKK/NF-κB signaling pathway is also activated in freshly isolated adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) cells that often lack detectable Tax expression. The mechanism underlying this Tax-independent pathway of NF-κB activation remains poorly understood. Clarifying the precise nature and consequences of the constitutive NF-κB activation in ATL cells is important for developing rational therapeutic strategies for this T-cell malignancy.

## Introduction

Human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I) is an oncogenic retrovirus that is etiologically associated with an acute T-cell malignancy, termed adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) (Poiesz *et al.*, 1980; Yoshida *et al.*, 1982). Unlike animal retroviruses, which transform host cells via oncogene transduction or cis-activation of proto-oncogenes (Burmeister, 2001), HTLV-1 induces T-cell transformation by deploying cellular genes that are normally involved in T-cell growth and survival

(Matsuoka, 2003) as well as deregulating the function of cellular factors involved in cell cycle control and DNA damage repair (Jeang *et al.*, 2004). Early studies demonstrate that HTLV-I infection promotes the expression of various cytokines and their receptors, most notably the T-cell growth factor interleukin-2 (IL-2) (Maruyama *et al.*, 1987; Siekevitz *et al.*, 1987) and the α subunit of its high-affinity receptor complex (IL-2Rα) (Inoue *et al.*, 1986; Cross *et al.*, 1987; Siekevitz *et al.*, 1987). More recent gene array analyses reveal the abnormal expression of a large number of additional genes associated with HTLV-I-induced T-cell transformation (Harhaj *et al.*, 1999a; de La Fuente *et al.*, 2000; Pise-Masison *et al.*, 2002; Koga *et al.*, 2004; Sasaki *et al.*, 2005). Among these genes are those encoding cytokines and cytokine receptors, apoptosis inhibitors, cell cycle regulators, immune receptors that belong to the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) family, transcription factors, and intracellular signaling molecules. Additionally, HTLV-I induces the expression of genes involved in cell immortalization and tumor metastasis (Mori *et al.*, 2002a; Sinha-Datta *et al.*, 2004; Sasaki *et al.*, 2005). Thus, it is apparent that the oncogenic action of HTLV-I involves deregulation of diverse cellular genes.

The pX region of the HTLV-I genome encodes a number of nonstructural proteins, including Tax (Jeang, 2001), Rex (Younis and Green, 2005), and the accessory proteins encoded by the open reading frames I (p12I and p27I) and II (p13II and p30II) (Albrecht and Lairmore, 2002; Kehn *et al.*, 2004). Several of these proteins exhibit signaling functions and contribute to cellular gene modulation by HTLV-I (Albrecht and Lairmore, 2002; Kehn *et al.*, 2004; Bindhu *et al.*, 2005). The most notable viral regulatory protein is, however, the 40 kDa trans-activator protein Tax (Jeang, 2001; Yoshida, 2001; Franchini *et al.*, 2003). In addition to regulating viral gene expression through the 5′ long terminal repeat (LTR), Tax induces or represses the expression of a large variety of cellular genes (Sun and Ballard, 1999; Ng *et al.*, 2001). Consistently, emerging evidence suggests that Tax serves as the primary oncogenic mediator of HTLV-I (Franchini *et al.*, 2003). Tax induces cell immortalization and transformation in vitro (Grassmann *et al.*, 1989; Pozzatti *et al.*, 1990; Tanaka *et al.*, 1990; Grassmann *et al.*, 1992; Akagi and Shimotohno, 1993) as well as tumor formation in transgenic mice (Hinrichs *et al.*, 1987; Nerenberg *et al.*,

*Correspondence: S-C Sun; E-mail: sxs70@psu.edu and S Yamaoka; E-mail: shojmmb@tmd.ac.jp

1987; Grossman *et al.*, 1995). More recently, an essential role of Tax in the induction of T-cell immortalization by HTLV-I as well as a related virus, HTLV-II, has been demonstrated by a genetic approach (Robek and Ratner, 1999; Ross *et al.*, 2000).

Lacking a typical DNA-binding domain, Tax does not have the capacity to directly transactivate target genes. However, this viral protein is able to modulate the activity of a number of cellular transcription factors, including cyclic AMP-responsive element-binding protein/activating transcription factor (CREB/ATF), NF-κB, serum responsive factor (SRF), NF-AT, basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) proteins, and p53 (Sun and Ballard, 1999; Pise-Masison and Brady, 2005). Members of the CREB/ATF family participate in Tax-mediated transactivation of the HTLV-I LTR (Jeang *et al.*, 1988; Zhao and Giam, 1991, 1992; Suzuki *et al.*, 1993a). These cellular factors physically interact with Tax and are directed to a Tax-specific enhancer (Tax-responsive element) located in the HTLV-I LTR (Franklin and Nyborg, 1995). Tax also promotes the transactivation activity of CREB/ATF by recruiting transcriptional coactivators CBP/p300 (Franklin and Nyborg, 1995; Azran *et al.*, 2004). Through modulation of the other transcription factors, Tax induces or represses the expression of various cellular genes. In this case, NF-κB has been established as a key mediator of Tax-stimulated cellular gene expression (Sun and Ballard, 1999). Although tightly regulated in normal T cells, NF-κB is constitutively activated in HTLV-I-infected and Tax-expressing T cells. Uncontrolled NF-κB activation is also associated with a large variety of other human cancers and known to mediate cancer cell growth and survival (Sun and Xiao, 2003). Thus, the Tax-mediated NF-κB activation may serve as a critical step in the induction of T-cell transformation by HTLV-I.

Whereas Tax clearly plays a primary role in HTLV-I-induced NF-κB activation, recent studies reveal that NF-κB is constitutively activated in freshly isolated ATL cells despite their lack of detectable Tax expression (Mori *et al.*, 1999; Hironaka *et al.*, 2004). This finding not only further underscores the importance of NF-κB in HTLV-I-mediated T-cell transformation but also implicates transition from Tax-dependent to Tax-independent NF-κB activation that occurs during the multistep process of leukemogenesis and may be essential for development of ATL. Compared to the extensive studies on Tax-mediated NF-κB activation, little is known about how ATL cells accomplish constitutive NF-κB activation in the absence of Tax. Nevertheless, the recent progress in elucidating the mechanism of NF-κB regulation in normal cells will have an impact on the understanding of NF-κB deregulation in HTLV-I-transformed T cells.

including the growth and survival of both T cells and nonlymphoid cells (Ghosh *et al.*, 1998; Silverman and Maniatis, 2001; Karin and Lin, 2002; Ruland and Mak, 2003; Sun and Xiao, 2003). In mammals, the NF-κB family is composed of five structurally related members, RelA, RelB, c-Rel, NF-κB1, and NF-κB2, which form various dimeric complexes that transactivate target genes bearing a κB enhancer (Siebenlist *et al.*, 1994). NF-κB1 and NF-κB2 are translated as precursor proteins, p105 and p100, which upon proteasome-mediated processing generate the mature NF-κB subunits, p50 and p52, respectively (Siebenlist *et al.*, 1994). The NF-κB proteins are normally sequestered in the cytoplasm by physical interaction with a family of inhibitory proteins, including IκBα, IκBβ, and related proteins (Baldwin, 1996). The NF-κB precursor proteins, p105 and p100, contain IκB-like sequences in their C-terminal portion and also function as NF-κB inhibitors (Rice *et al.*, 1992; Mercurio *et al.*, 1993). Thus, the processing of these precursor proteins serves to both generate mature NF-κB subunits and disrupt their IκB-like function.

The latent NF-κB complexes can be activated by diverse immune stimuli, such as antigens, cytokines, and microbial components, which target two alternative NF-κB signaling pathways: the canonical and noncanonical pathways (Pomerantz and Baltimore, 2002; Hayden and Ghosh, 2004) (Figure 1). The canonical pathway of NF-κB activation is induced by diverse stimuli and involves rapid phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of the prototypical NF-κB inhibitor, IκBα, and the concomitant nuclear translocation of p50/RelA and p50/c-Rel NF-κB complexes (Karin and Ben-Neriah, 2000). This pathway is mediated through activation of an IκB kinase (IKK) complex composed of two catalytic subunits, IKKα and IKKβ, and a regulatory subunit, IKKγ (also named NEMO, IKKAP1, and FIP3) (Karin and Ben-Neriah, 2000). The noncanonical pathway of NF-κB activation is dependent on site-specific phosphorylation and processing of the NF-κB2 precursor protein p100 (Xiao *et al.*, 2001b). This atypical pathway is specifically elicited by a small subset of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family members (Claudio *et al.*, 2002; Coope *et al.*, 2002; Dejardin *et al.*, 2002; Kayagaki *et al.*, 2002; Pomerantz and Baltimore, 2002; Novack *et al.*, 2003) and is required for the activation of specific NF-κB species, especially the p52/RelB dimer (Derudder *et al.*, 2003; Yilmaz *et al.*, 2003; Bonizzi *et al.*, 2004). The noncanonical NF-κB signaling pathway does not require the trimeric IKK complex but is mediated by the NF-κB inducing kinase (NIK) and one of the IKK components, IKKα (Senftleben *et al.*, 2001; Xiao *et al.*, 2001b). Consistently, IKKα, but not IKKβ, phosphorylates the C-terminal region of p100 (Senftleben *et al.*, 2001). Unlike the canonical pathway, which mediates the general functions of NF-κB in different cell types, the noncanonical NF-κB pathway is deployed only in specific cell types, such as B cells and lymphoid stromal cells, and plays a particular role in regulating B-cell maturation and lymphoid organogenesis.

Figure 1 Activation of two NF-κB signaling pathways by Tax. Activation of NF-κB by immune stimuli involves canonical and noncanonical pathways, which are based on degradation of IκB or processing of p100, respectively. The canonical pathway is stimulated by diverse cellular stimuli, such as antigens and cytokines, and is dependent on the trimeric IKK complex as well as certain upstream kinases, such as MEKK3 and PKCθ. The noncanonical pathway responds to a subset of TNF family members, including BAFF and CD40L, and requires NIK and its downstream kinase IKKα but not IKKγ or IKKβ. Tax activates both NF-κB pathways by physically targeting two different IKK complexes, both requiring the adaptor protein IKKγ. Formation of the noncanonical Tax/IKK complex requires the interaction of Tax with both IKKγ and p100.

### Aberrant activation of NF-κB by HTLV-I

Under normal conditions, the signals mediating NF-κB activation in T cells as well as most other cell types are transient and stimulate predominantly the canonical NF-κB pathway. Such a signaling mechanism ensures the rapid, but short-lived, nuclear expression of NF-κB members that are required for temporal proliferation and survival of antigen-stimulated T cells. This mechanism is achieved through different levels of regulation. First, following stimulation by an antigen, both the T-cell receptor (TCR) and its proximal signaling molecules are downregulated, thus preventing persistent signaling through the cell surface receptor (Jang and Gu, 2003). Second, the NF-κB signaling pathway involves a negative feedback mechanism, whereby the activated NF-κB induces the expression and *de novo* synthesis of the inhibitory protein IκBα (Brown et al., 1993; Scott et al., 1993; Sun et al., 1993). The newly synthesized IκBα is able to enter the nucleus and stop the function of NF-κB.

Despite its tight control in normal T cells, NF-κB is constitutively activated in both HTLV-I-transformed T-cell lines and freshly isolated ATL cells (Ballard et al., 1988; Leung and Nabel, 1988; Ruben et al., 1988; Arima et al., 1991, 1999). The persistent activation of NF-κB by HTLV-I appears to be mediated through a mechanism that does not involve the TCR or its proximal signaling molecules, such as Src and Syk families of protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs). In fact, a characteristic of HTLV-I-transformed T cells is the loss of TCR and upstream PTKs (Koga et al., 1989; Yssel et al., 1989; de Waal Malefyt et al., 1990; Harhaj et al., 1999a; Weil et al., 1999). It is generally believed that the viral Tax protein serves as an intracellular NF-κB inducer that acts by bypassing the TCR-proximal signaling factors.

The following sections discuss the mechanisms by which Tax overrides the negative feedback regulation of NF-κB, causing constitutive nuclear expression of various NF-κB members.

A hallmark of Tax-stimulated NF-κB activation is the marked induction of *nfkb2* gene product, p52, in addition to the canonical NF-κB members (Lanoix *et al.*, 1994; Xiao *et al.*, 2001a) (Figure 1). In normal T cells, p52 exists largely as its precursor, p100, even when the cells are activated by T-cell mitogens (Xiao *et al.*, 2001a). Remarkably, when human T cells are infected with HTLV-I, p100 undergoes active processing, a phenotype that is also detected in a large panel of HTLV-I-infected T-cell lines (Xiao *et al.*, 2001a) and leukemic cell-derived ATL cell lines (Hironaka *et al.*, 2004). Several lines of evidence suggest that uncontrolled p100 processing or p52 production may promote abnormal cell growth and development of lymphoid malignancies. First, mutant mice expressing p52 in a background that lacks p100 develop gastric and lymphoid hyperplasia (Ishikawa *et al.*, 1997). Second, the human *nfkb2* gene is involved in chromosomal translocations that are associated with the development of lymphomas (Rayet and Gelinas, 1999). Interestingly, in all cases analysed, the rearranged *nfkb2* genes encode p100 truncation mutants lacking part of their C-terminal IkB-like sequences. Based on these observations, it is tempting to speculate that deregulation of p100 processing may play an important role in HTLV-I-induced T-cell transformation.

### Tax as an intracellular stimulator of IKK

Over the past decade, significant progress has been made toward understanding the mechanism of NF-κB activation by Tax. Based on the studies on CREB/ATF, it was initially suggested that Tax activates NF-κB via physical interactions with NF-κB subunits (Yoshida, 2001). Indeed, Tax binds to several NF-κB members, including RelA, p50, and p52 (Suzuki *et al.*, 1993b, 1994; Béraud *et al.*, 1994; Murakami *et al.*, 1995). Tax also interacts with members of the IkB family, such as IkBa, and the NF-κB precursor proteins p105 and p100 (Hirai *et al.*, 1992; Béraud *et al.*, 1994; Lanoix *et al.*, 1994; Suzuki *et al.*, 1995; Petropoulos and Hiscott, 1998). While such virus/host interactions may contribute to the activation of NF-κB by Tax, it is, however, clear that Tax cannot directly activate NF-κB via physical interactions with NF-κB or IkB members. Strong evidence suggests the requirement of the cellular protein kinase IKK in Tax-mediated NF-κB activation.

The involvement of cellular signaling pathways in Tax activation of NF-κB was first suggested by the finding that IkBa undergoes constitutive phosphorylation and degradation in HTLV-I-infected T cells (Sun *et al.*, 1994; Lacoste *et al.*, 1995). Additional studies revealed that Tax induces the degradation of both IkBa and another IkB member, IkBβ (Kanno *et al.*, 1994; Good and Sun, 1996; McKinsey *et al.*, 1996). Since Tax has no kinase activity, these findings argued for the activation of a cellular IKK by Tax. More direct evidence for the involvement of a cellular kinase in Tax-mediated NF-κB activation came from the finding that Tax induces IkBa phosphorylation at two regulatory serines, serine-32 and serine-36 (Brockman *et al.*, 1995), which also serve as the sites of IkBa phosphorylation induced by cellular stimuli (Brown *et al.*, 1995; Traenckner *et al.*, 1995). Indeed, soon after the identification of IKK, it became clear that Tax is an intracellular stimulator of this pivotal cellular signaling molecule (Chu *et al.*, 1998; Geleziunas *et al.*, 1998; Uhlik *et al.*, 1998; Yin *et al.*, 1998). Constitutive IKK activity was detected in both HTLV-I-infected and Tax-transfected cells. An essential role for IKK in Tax-mediated NF-κB activation was subsequently confirmed by genetic studies using both nonlymphoid and T-cell systems (Yamaoka *et al.*, 1998; Harhaj *et al.*, 2000).

In addition to mediating IkB degradation and nuclear translocation of NF-κB, IKK also regulates phosphorylation of the RelA subunit of NF-κB, a modification that is required for the transactivation function of NF-κB. IKKa plays an important role in Tax-induced phosphorylation of RelA, although IKKβ is essential for Tax-induced nuclear translocation of the canonical NF-κB (O'Mahony *et al.*, 2004). Interestingly, IKKa also serves as a central component of Tax-stimulated noncanonical NF-κB signaling pathway, which is responsible for hyperactivation of p52-containing NF-κB complexes (Xiao *et al.*, 2001a). Thus, by stimulating different IKK components, Tax targets different axes of the NF-κB signaling network.

### Adaptor function of IKKy in Tax-mediated activation of IKK

How Tax persistently stimulates the activity of IKK is not completely understood. Nevertheless, Tax physically associates with IKK, which likely contributes to the sustained IKK activation (Sun and Ballard, 1999) (Figure 1). In HTLV-I-transformed T cells, Tax is stably assembled into the canonical IKK complex, in which IKK remains chronically phosphorylated and activated (Chu *et al.*, 1998; Carter *et al.*, 2001). The Tax/IKK complex formation relies on physical interaction between Tax and the IKK regulatory subunit, IKKy (Chu *et al.*, 1999; Harhaj and Sun, 1999; Jin *et al.*, 1999). Tax appears to directly target IKKy, since these two proteins interact in both mammalian cells (Chu *et al.*, 1999; Harhaj and Sun, 1999; Jin *et al.*, 1999) and yeast cells (Jin *et al.*, 1999). The Tax/IKKy interaction is required for recruiting Tax to the IKK catalytic subunits and for Tax-mediated activation of IKK (Xiao *et al.*, 2000). Consistently, genetic studies have established IKKy as an essential factor for Tax-stimulated activation of IKK and NF-κB in both fibroblasts and T cells (Yamaoka *et al.*, 1998; Harhaj *et al.*, 2000). Detailed mutagenesis analyses identified a helix structure of IKKy that is required for its interaction with Tax (Xiao

et al., 2000). Interestingly, a homologous sequence element is present in Tax and is required for the IKKγ-binding function of Tax. It is currently unclear whether this sequence motif forms the IKKγ/Tax interaction surface or is required for maintaining the conformation of IKKγ and Tax.

A major missing link in the Tax-specific NF-κB signaling pathway is how the Tax/IKK physical interaction leads to IKK activation. Since Tax is known to undergo oligomerization (Tie et al., 1996; Jin and Jeang, 1997), one possibility is that Tax stimulates the catalytic activity of IKK through physical crosslinking of the kinase complex. In further support of this hypothesis, fusion of Tax to the IKK catalytic subunits is sufficient for stimulating IKK catalytic activity (Xiao and Sun, 2000). Another potential mechanism of Tax action is that the Tax/IKK physical interaction allows Tax to recruit an IKK-activating kinase to the IKK complex, thereby triggering the activation of IKK by the upstream kinase. Tax has been shown to interact with a MAP3K, MEKK1, which contributes to Tax-mediated IKK activation at least in transfected cells (Yin et al., 1998). Although it is unclear whether MEKK1 is present in the Tax/IKK complex under endogenous conditions, it is interesting that this MAP3K is predominantly expressed as a truncated form in HTLV-I-infected T cells (Li et al., 1999). It remains to be examined whether such a modification activates MEKK1 and whether MEKK1 is required for IKK activation in HTLV-I-infected T cells.

subunits, the noncanonical Tax/IKK complex lacks IKKβ but contains p100 (Xiao et al., 2001a). Thus, by targeting different IKK complexes, Tax stimulates both the canonical and noncanonical NF-κB signaling pathways.

The formation of Tax/IKK/p100 complex requires binding of Tax to both IKKγ and p100. The N-terminal region of p100 contains two short alpha helices that are known to be exposed on the protein surface and not involved in the general folding of p52 (Cramer et al., 1997). Interestingly, these two helices mediate the binding of p100 to Tax. Disruption of these helices abolishes the Tax/p100 interaction and the assembly of p100/Tax/IKKα complex, as well as Tax-stimulated p100 processing (Xiao et al., 2001a). These findings suggest that induction of p100 processing requires not only activation of IKKα but also recruitment of this kinase to p100. This potential mechanism has also been suggested for NIK-induced p100 processing (Xiao et al., 2004). Like Tax, NIK interacts with both p100 and IKKα and induces the formation of a p100/NIK/IKKα trimeric complex. However, unlike Tax, NIK is able to directly interact with IKKα, which explains why IKKγ is dispensable for this cellular pathway.

Indirect mechanisms of NF-κB activation by HTLV-I: involvement of a positive feedback loop?

The physical interaction of Tax with IKK is likely a primary mechanism by which HTLV-I induces persistent activation of NF-κB. However, it is also conceivable that additional mechanisms may be involved in the maintenance of constitutive NF-κB activation in HTLV-I-infected T cells and Tax-expressing cells. We propose that a positive feedback mechanism may exist due to Tax-induced expression of various signaling molecules (Figure 2). One major class of such signaling molecules includes members of the TNFR superfamily, such as CD40, OX40, and CD30 (Higashimura et al., 1996; Harhaj et al., 1999, 2005; Pankow et al., 2000; Pise-Masison et al., 2002). CD40 is a costimulatory molecule that is normally expressed on B cells and antigen-presenting cells, but not on T cells (Harnett, 2004). The abnormal expression of CD40 on Tax-expressing T cells has important functional implications, since it targets the activation of both canonical and noncanonical NF-κB signaling pathways (Coope et al., 2002; Zarnegar et al., 2004). Indeed, enforced expression of CD40 on Jurkat T cells renders them responsive to stimulation by CD40 ligand (CD40L) (Harhaj et al., 2005). Like CD40, both OX40 and CD30 have the capacity to induce activation of NF-κB (Arch and Thompson, 1998; Kawamata et al., 1998; Horie et al., 2003). Notably, CD30 is also overexpressed in other malignant cells, including the Hodgkin's lymphoma cells (Al-Shamkhani, 2004), which have constitutive activation of both canonical and noncanonical NF-κB pathways (Horie et al., 2003; Nonaka et al., 2005). In further support of the potential involvement of TNFRs in a

NF-κB2/p100 serves as a target for Tax in the noncanonical NF-κB signaling pathway

Under physiological conditions, the noncanonical NF-κB activation occurs primarily in B cells and lymphoid stromal cells but not in T cells. The capacity of Tax to induce both the canonical and noncanonical NF-κB signaling pathways explains the composition similarity of nuclear NF-κB in HTLV-I-transformed T cells and antigen-activated B cells (Liou et al., 1994; Sun et al., 1994). Biochemical and genetic studies suggest that Tax does not use the same signaling components that mediate the induction of p100 processing by cellular stimuli (Xiao et al., 2001a). In contrast to the cellular pathway, the Tax-stimulated p100 processing does not require NIK. Furthermore, this virus-specific pathway requires both IKKγ and IKKα (Figure 1), whereas the cellular pathway requires IKKα but not IKKγ (Pomerantz and Baltimore, 2002; Hayden and Ghosh, 2004). These results imply that Tax-stimulated noncanonical NF-κB signaling bypasses NIK but goes through IKKα. The requirement of IKKγ in the Tax-specific pathway appears to be due to the adaptor role of IKKγ in facilitating the assembly of a Tax/IKKα complex. As demonstrated for canonical NF-κB activation, Tax induction of p100 processing requires its physical interaction with IKK. However, unlike the canonical Tax/IKK complex, which contains all three IKK

is indirectly mediated through repressing the transactivation activity of bHLH factors, such as c-Myb (Nicot et al., 2001). NF-κB inhibits the function of c-Myb through RelA-mediated sequestration of the coactivator proteins CBP/p300.

Recent studies suggest that NF-κB is also involved in functional inactivation of the tumor suppressor p53 (Pise-Masison and Brady, 2005). Although the p53 gene remains intact in HTLV-I-transformed T cells, its product lacks transcriptional activity (Reid et al., 1993; Gartenhaus and Wang, 1995; Cereseto et al., 1996; Pise-Masison et al., 1998a; Takemoto et al., 2000). The p53 inactivation is mediated by Tax (Uittenbogaard et al., 1995; Akagi et al., 1997; Mulloy et al., 1998; Pise-Masison et al., 1998a), which is thought to act through two different mechanisms (Figure 3). The first involves sequestration of the transcriptional coactivator CBP/p300 by Tax (Mulloy et al., 1998; Suzuki et al., 1999; Arium et al., 2000; Van et al., 2001). The second mechanism, which appears to be more important in T cells that express high levels of p300, is dependent on the phosphorylation of p53 and the activation of NF-κB (Pise-Masison et al., 1998b, 2000, 2001). Interestingly, the latter mechanism involves Tax-induced physical interaction between RelA and p53, which leads to inactivation of the transactivation function of p53 (Jeong et al., 2004). This RelA/p53 molecular play in turn requires IKKβ-mediated phosphorylation of RelA at serine 536 (Jeong et al., 2005). Since RelA phosphorylation is known to promote its binding to CBP/p300, the NF-κB-dependent p53 inactivation may also involve RelA-mediated sequestration of transcriptional coactivators (Figure 3). It is noteworthy, however, that Tax may also inactivate p53 via an NF-κB- and CBP/p300-independent mechanism (Miyazato et al., 2005). Nevertheless, it seems clear that the Tax-mediated NF-κB activation contributes to p53 inactivation at least under certain conditions. Thus, through activation of NF-κB, Tax induces the expression of various NF-κB target genes that promote cell growth and survival as well as suppresses the expression of target genes of p53 and bHLH factors involved in DNA repair and cell cycle checkpoint regulation. Both types of effector functions of NF-κB likely contribute to the induction of T-cell transformation.

More direct evidence for the requirement of NF-κB in HTLV-I-induced T-cell immortalization was obtained by using recombinant HTLV-I clones carrying mutant forms of Tax (Robek and Ratner, 1999). These studies suggest that activation of NF-κB, but not CREB/ATF, is required for the induction of T-cell immortalization by HTLV-I. Activation of NF-κB is also essential for Tax-induced IL-2-independent T-cell growth (Iwanaga et al., 1999). The role of NF-κB in Tax-stimulated transformation of nonlymphoid cells appears to vary among different experimental conditions. Several studies reveal that inhibition of NF-κB blocks the growth of Tax-transformed rodent fibroblasts (Kitajima et al., 1992; Yamaoka et al., 1996; Matsumoto et al., 1997) and causes the regression of implanted fibrosarcoma in mice (Kitajima et al., 1992). However, other studies

Implications of NF-κB in HTLV-I-induced T-cell transformation

The constitutive activation of NF-κB in both HTLV-I-transformed T-cell lines and freshly isolated ATL cells argues for a critical role of this cellular factor in mediating the development of ATL. Through induction of genes involved in T-cell proliferation and apoptosis inhibition (Kane et al., 2002; Wan and DeGregori, 2003; Lucas et al., 2004), NF-κB may contribute to the abnormal growth and survival of T cells during the early stages of ATL disease progression. In addition, the constitutive NF-κB activity also likely promotes the genetic changes that drive the progression of T-cell transformation. In this regard, NF-κB is responsible for Tax-mediated inhibition of certain genes involved in DNA repair and cell cycle checkpoint regulation, especially those encoding β-polymerase and p53 (Uittenbogaard et al., 1994, 1995). This function of NF-κB

Figure 3 NF-κB mediates both the induction and repression of Tax target genes. Tax stimulates IKK, which phosphorylates both IκB and RelA. Once translocated to the nucleus, the phosphorylated RelA participates in the transactivation of NF-κB target genes involved in cell proliferation, survival, and migration. Additionally, the phosphorylated RelA represses the function of p53 and bHLH members, resulting in the inhibition of genes involved in DNA repair, apoptosis induction, and G1/S cell cycle arrest. RelA exerts these functions through either sequestration of the coactivator proteins CBP/p300 or direct interaction with p53.

suggest that CREB/ATF, but not NF-κB, is required for  
Tax-induced transformation of Rat2 cells (Smith and  
Greene, 1991) and immortalization of human primary  
T cells (Rosin et al., 1998). It is likely that such a  
discrepancy is attributed to the different cell systems  
and/or experimental conditions employed in the differ-  
ent studies. Nevertheless, it is clear that NF-κB plays a  
critical role in HTLV-I-induced T-cell immortalization  
in vitro. Given the constitutive activation of NF-κB in  
freshly isolated ATL cells, it is logical to propose that  
NF-κB is a pivotal cellular transcription factor that  
promotes the development of ATL in HTLV-I-infected  
patients.

Loss of viral gene expression in the late stages of ATL  
leukemogenesis  

Previous reports demonstrated that expression of the  
viral proteins was barely detectable in the peripheral  
blood lymphocytes freshly isolated from ATL patients  
(Kinoshita et al., 1989; Furukawa et al., 1995). This  
could partly be explained by the hypermethylation  

(Koiwa et al., 2002) or defect (Tamiya et al., 1996) in  
the 5′ LTR of the HTLV-1 provirus. In addition,  
nonsense or missense mutations of the tax gene were  
reported in certain ATL cases (Furukawa et al., 2001).  
The frequent lack of detectable viral gene expression in  
ATL cells is thought to be a result of the host immune  
surveillance. Tax is essential for immortalization of  
infected T cells (Grassmann et al., 1989; Akagi and  
Shimotohno, 1993), but is also known as a major target  
of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated immunity  
(Jacobson et al., 1990; Kannagi et al., 1993). Expression  
of Tax should activate CTL, which in turn, would target  
Tax-positive cells for killing. This process may facilitate  
selective outgrowth of cells that lost viral gene expres-  
sion and instead acquired Tax-independent growth  
advantages through alterations of host gene expression  
(Figure 4). In fact, a stochastic analysis supported a  
multistep carcinogenesis, in which at least five additional  
genetic or epigenetic changes in the host genome appear  
to be required for the leukemogenesis (Okamoto et al.,  
1980). This could partly explain why primary leukemic  
cells, but not established T-cell lines transformed in vitro  
by HTLV-I, had the ability to grow in severe combined  
immunodeficiency (SCID) mice (Imada et al., 1995).
Thus, expression of viral proteins including Tax appears not necessary at the late stage of disease progression. These ideas are consistent with the long latency until the onset of ATL, its relatively low incidence (Tajima, 1990), and mono- or oligoclonal growth of leukemic cells. As a result, certain genes regulated by NF-$\kappa$B are differentially expressed in freshly isolated primary leukemic cells and Tax-positive T-cell lines (Koga et al., 2004; Sasaki et al., 2005). For instance, OX40 ligand, or gp34, is strongly expressed in Tax-positive HTLV-I-transformed cells (Miura et al., 1991), but cannot be found in primary ATL cells (Imura et al., 1997). The Tax-induced expression of gp34 in T cells was shown to depend on NF-$\kappa$B activation, while stimulation of these cells with phorbol ester and ionomycin, which successfully activated NF-$\kappa$B, failed to induce gp34 expression (Ohtani et al., 1998). Similar divergent gene expression was reported for CD40 (Harhaj et al., 2005). It would be important, therefore, to investigate what cellular changes actually replace multiple Tax functions, including NF-$\kappa$B activation, to support the neoplastic features of ATL cells. Despite the lack of significant Tax expression, primary leukemic cells in all the patients examined showed constitutive activation of NF-$\kappa$B (Mori et al., 1999) and AP-1 (Mori et al., 2000), transcription factors that are known as targets of Tax, suggesting that these transcription factors play pivotal roles in the ATL pathogenesis. Indeed, loss of NF-$\kappa$B activity in ATL cells following expression of a super-repressor form of I$\kappa$B$\alpha$ (Hironaka et al., 2004) or treatment with an NF-$\kappa$B inhibitor Bay 11-7082 (Mori et al., 2002b) led to apoptotic cell death,

indicating that ATL cells require constitutive NF-$\kappa$B activity for survival. NF-$\kappa$B was reported to play important roles in other types of cancer as well (reviewed in Karin et al., 2002), including breast cancer, prostate cancer, multiple myeloma, Hodgkin’s lymphoma, melanoma, Kaposi’s sarcoma, and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). Abnormalities in known tumor suppressor genes, p53 (Cesarma et al., 1992, Sakashita et al., 1992) and p16/INK4 (Hatta et al., 1995), are also implicated in the progression of tumor cells to acute ATL.

### Mechanism of Tax-independent NF-$\kappa$B activation

Part of the differential gene expression in Tax-positive and Tax-negative cells may result from distinct compositions of nuclear NF-$\kappa$B DNA-binding complexes in these cells. It was reported that the NF-$\kappa$B species highly expressed in ATL cells were different from those observed in T-cell lines infected *in vitro*; mRNAs for p52/p100 and c-Rel were abundantly expressed in Tax-expressing T-cell lines, whereas those for p50/p105 and RelA were highly expressed in ATL cells (Arima et al., 1991; Creon et al., 1993; Li et al., 1993; Lanoix et al., 1994; Inoue et al., 1998). Accordingly, NF-$\kappa$B DNA-binding activity in Tax-expressing T-cell lines was composed predominantly of c-Rel, p50, and p52 (Lanoix et al., 1994; Xiao et al., 2001a), whereas that in Tax-negative HTLV-I-infected T-cell lines and primary ATL cells contained p50 and RelA (Mori

Figure 4 Progression of T cells from HTLV-I infection to ATL. Tax-mediated immortalization of HTLV-I-infected T cells is essential to initiate multistep process of leukemogenesis, because Tax-induced cell replication and perturbation of DNA repair pathways are required for genetic and epigenetic changes in provirus and host genes. However, HTLV-I gene expression also triggers host T-cell immune responses to eliminate Tax-positive T cells, leading to selective outgrowth of HTLV-I-infected T-cell clones that have acquired the ability to proliferate in the absence of Tax. Tax-independent constitutive NF-$\kappa$B activity in primary leukemic T cells implicates its pivotal role in the development of ATL   Oncogene
et al., 1999). RelB was found in the DNA-binding complexes regardless of Tax expression (our unpublished observation). In the cytoplasm of resting cells, RelB is mainly sequestered by p100 (Solan et al., 2002). We demonstrated aberrant expression of p52 as well as phosphorylation of IkBa at Ser32 in Tax-negative ATL cell lines (Hironaka et al., 2004). The steady-state levels of IkBβ in these cells were higher than in Tax-positive HTLV-I-transformed cells, most probably because IkBβ was targeted for degradation in the presence, but not in the absence, of Tax (Good and Sun, 1996; McKinsey et al., 1996). Two of three ATL cell lines expressed the normal p100 protein, although multiply truncated forms of p100 were detected in one of the three ATL cell lines examined. As discussed above, a variety of rearrangements or deletions in the *nfkb2* locus have been identified in human lymphoid malignancies unrelated to HTLV-I infection. Mutations cluster within the 3′ ankyrin-encoding domain of the *nfkb2* gene and lead to production of abnormal proteins, which results in loss of IkB function (Kim et al., 2000) and constitutive p52 production and DNA-binding activity (reviewed in Neri et al., 1996). Deregulated production of p52 has also been reported in breast cancer cells, CTCL-derived cell lines and Hodgkin Reed-Sternberg cells (Thakur et al., 1994; Cogswell et al., 2000; Nonaka et al., 2005). These cancer cells may require an activity that induces the processing of p100 and disrupts its potent IkB function to keep the high NF-κB activity. The processing of p100 mediates nuclear translocation of RelB, since p100, and not IkBa, specifically retains RelB in the cytoplasm (Solan et al., 2002). It would be important to investigate if the disruption of p100’s IkB function, as well as modifications of the transactivation function of p52/RelB dimer, contributes to leukemogenesis. However, these events do not appear to be sufficient for cancer development because none of the isolated p100 mutants or p52 can immediately induce cancer (Ishikawa et al., 1997).

The aberrant p52 expression and phosphorylation of IkBa at a specific serine residue suggested constitutively activated IKK in ATL cells. Immunocomplex kinase assay revealed constitutive IKKa-associated kinase activity in ATL cell lines, which was comparable to that in Tax-expressing HTLV-I-transformed cell lines (Hironaka et al., 2004). However, there appeared to be some differences in the status of the IKK components. Consistent with a previous report (Carter et al., 2001), IKKβ was phosphorylated in Tax-positive HTLV-I-transformed cells more strongly than in Tax-negative ATL cells. Tax-positive HTLV-I-transformed cells expressed relatively smaller amounts of NEMO and IKKa. Transient transfection experiments revealed that a catalytically inactive form of IKKa, but not that of IKKβ, suppressed NF-κB-dependent reporter gene expression in ATL cells. Together with the fact that expression of a NEMO mutant lacking the ability to interact with IKK did not affect NF-κB activity in ATL cell lines, it was speculated that the noncanonical pathway of NF-κB activation (Pomerantz and Baltimore, 2002) plays an important role in ATL cells.

recent work from our laboratory demonstrated distinct regulation of IKK activity in ATL and HTLV-I-transformed cells following treatment with a protein synthesis inhibitor, proteasome inhibitor, or arsenite (Miura et al., 2005).

In ATL cells, the status of intracellular signaling mediators upstream of the IKK complex remains largely unknown. In HTLV-I-transformed cells, the constitutive processing of p100 is induced through Tax-mediated IKKa activation, a mechanism that involves the formation of a Tax/p100/IKKa complex. In ATL cells lacking Tax expression, it is conceivable that a cellular IKK regulator, NIK, may play important roles in inducing p100 processing, because NIK is the sole cellular molecule so far reported that physically interacts with both p100 and IKKa and induces p100 processing (Xiao et al., 2001b). In other words, Tax may mimic NIK functions in HTLV-I-transformed cells, although the domains on p100 required for NIK- and Tax-induced processing seem different (Xiao et al., 2001a). Interestingly, recruitment of a constitutively active IKKa by a catalytically inactive NIK failed to induce processing of p100 (Xiao et al., 2004), suggesting an as yet unidentified role for NIK besides IKK activation and the docking function. It is currently unknown if these events hold true in Tax-independent NF-κB activation in ATL cells. While physiological roles of NIK in inducible p100 processing by extracellular stimuli have been studied extensively (Ramakrishnan et al., 2004), pathological consequences of NIK in constitutive IKK-dependent p100 processing found in tumor cells remain to be clarified. This is partly because detecting endogenous NIK and determining its catalytic activity have been extremely difficult. A few previous studies described NIK activation in melanoma cells (Dhawan and Richmond, 2002; Rangaswami et al., 2004), but the status of NIK in other types of tumor including ATL remains unknown. As described above, signals from a subset of the TNFR family members evoke the noncanonical NF-κB activation (Hauer et al., 2005). These receptors, when stimulated, oligomerize and recruit tumor necrosis factor-associated factors (TRAFs) that usually target a TRAF-binding sequence(s) present in the cytoplasmic part of receptors. As a result, TRAF proteins also oligomerize and transduce positive or negative signals to the downstream signaling molecules such as NIK. Aggregation of TRAF proteins in tumor cells was reported for Hodgkin Reed-Sternberg cells (Horie et al., 2002), which overexpress CD30 and show constitutive IKK activation and p100 processing (Nonaka et al., 2005). It will be intriguing to examine the status of TRAF proteins in ATL cells, which may hint the possibility of aberrant activation of a member of the TNFR family in ATL cells.

In summary, the phenotypes of advanced ATL cells are essentially different from HTLV-I-transformed cells in gene expression and tumorigenicity. Nevertheless, constitutively high NF-κB activity is present in HTLV-I-infected cells from the initial immortalization by Tax to the later stage of aggressive leukemia. The kinetics of

Rel and IkB proteins in ATL cells suggests significant contribution of the noncanonical NF-κB activation pathway, although the mechanism of IKK activation remains to be defined. Since constitutive NF-κB activity is required for survival of ATL cells, identification of upstream IKK regulators should facilitate establishing a novel molecular target for treatment of ATL.

### Conclusions and open questions

Strong evidence suggests that activation of NF-κB is an important part of the oncogenic mechanism of HTLV-I. This pathologic action largely relies on the viral transforming protein Tax, although a Tax-independent mechanism of NF-κB activation operates during the late stages of ATL disease progression. Over the past decade, significant progress has been made toward understanding the mechanism of Tax-dependent NF-κB activation. Most importantly, IKK has been established as a cellular target of Tax and an essential component in Tax-stimulated NF-κB signaling. Tax physically interacts with IKKγ as well as the nfkb2 gene product p100, thereby triggering the assembly of two different Tax/IKK complexes that mediate the activation of canonical and noncanonical NF-κB signaling pathways, respectively.

Despite these important findings, many questions remain to be addressed. For example, it is largely unknown how the Tax/IKK physical interaction triggers IKK activation. Another question is whether the persistent activation of NF-κB in HTLV-I-infected T cells is solely mediated by the direct action of Tax or involves a positive feedback mechanism. As discussed above, the HTLV-I-infected T cells are characterized by the heightened expression of a number of signaling receptors and intracellular signaling molecules, but their role in the persistent NF-κB activation remains poorly defined. Finally, it remains to be determined how NF-κB and IKK are activated in the absence of Tax and what role the Tax-independent NF-κB activation plays in the development of aggressive leukemia. Further investigation in these areas will no doubt provide novel insights into the mechanism of HTLV-I-induced T-cell transformation and contribute to establishing a rational strategy for treatment of ATL.
