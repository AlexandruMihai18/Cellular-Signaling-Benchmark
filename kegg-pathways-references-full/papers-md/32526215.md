## ABSTRACT

Breast cancer incidence is increasing globally and pesticides exposure may impact risk of developing this disease. Hexachlorobenzene (HCB) and chlorpyrifos (CPF) act as endocrine disruptors, inducing proliferation in breast cancer cells. Vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and nitric oxide (NO) are associated with angiogenesis. Our aim was to evaluate HCB and CPF action, both weak aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) ligands, on angiogenesis in breast cancer models. We used: (1) *in vivo* xenograft model with MCF-7 cells, (2) *in vitro* breast cancer model with MCF-7, and (3) *in vitro* neovasculogenesis model with endothelial cells exposed to conditioned medium from MCF-7. Results show that HCB (3 mg/kg) and CPF (0.1 mg/kg) stimulated vascular density in the *in vivo* model. HCB and CPF low doses enhanced VEGF-A and COX-2 expression, accompanied by increased levels of nitric oxide synthases (NOS), and NO release in MCF-7. HCB and CPF high doses intensified VEGF-A and COX-2 levels but rendered different effects on NOS, however, both pesticides reduced NO production. Moreover, our data indicate that HCB and CPF-induced VEGF-A expression is mediated by estrogen receptor and NO, while the increase in COX-2 is through AhR and NO pathways in MCF-7. In conclusion, we demonstrate that HCB and CPF environmental concentrations stimulate angiogenic switch *in vivo*. Besides, pesticides induce VEGF-A and COX-2 expression, as well as NO production in MCF-7, promoting tubulogenesis in endothelial cells. These findings show that pesticide exposure could stimulate angiogenesis, a process that has been demonstrated to contribute to breast cancer progression.

1. **Introduction**

Breast cancer is the most frequent cancer type in women worldwide (Torre et al., 2015), and Argentina has one of the highest mortality rates in America (INC, 2018). Estrogen receptor α-positive (ERα+) breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed breast cancer subtype in women, which is why the use of these models has special relevance. The hereditary component has a small contribution, the environment and lifestyle being the major risk factors. Compounds acting as endocrine disruptors (EDs) interrupt normal breast development and lead to

adverse consequences (Macon and Fenton, 2013), like hexachlorobenzene (HCB) and chlorpyrifos (CPF). HCB was used as a fungicide, which is still released into the environment as a byproduct of industrial processes, and it is detected in human and cow's milk for consumption (Chen et al., 2014). CPF is an organophosphorus insecticide utilized for pest control in agriculture and home maintenance in the world (Loewy et al., 2011). Our previous studies indicated that HCB induces cell proliferation through an estrogenic pathway, activating ERα and c-Src in MCF-7 breast cancer cells (García et al., 2010), and promotes mammary tumor growth in an *in vivo* rat model (Peña et al., 2012). In addition, the induction of mammary gland ductal hyperplasia was observed in rats exposed to CPF (Ventura et al., 2016), in turn, that this pesticide increases tumor incidence in a rat model with chemically-induced mammary tumors (Ventura et al., 2019). Furthermore, HCB weakly binds to the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) in *in vitro* and *in vivo* models (Hahn et al., 1989), while CPF was observed to behave as a weak ligand of the AhR *in vitro* (Medjakovic et al., 2014). Once pesticides bind to the AhR, they trigger on the one hand, membrane actions, where c-Src activates growth factor receptors, and on the other, nuclear actions, modulating gene transcription with xenobiotic response elements (XRE) in the promoter of target genes, such as cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (Haarmann-Stemmann et al., 2009; Roman et al., 2009).

Angiogenesis is a process that involves the formation of new vessels from preexisting vessels, which are critical for solid tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis (Folkman, 1986). VEGF-A is one of the most important proangiogenic factors secreted by tumor cells, promoting angiogenesis and endothelial cell permeability (Breslin et al., 2003). COX-2 is an enzyme implicated in prostaglandins synthesis, inducible by growth factors and cytokines (Ivkovic, 2010). Elevated COX-2 detected in mammary tumors marks a poor prognosis (Howe, 2007), resulting in high levels of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in tumor microenvironment. Nitric oxide (NO), a key mediator of angiogenesis, is produced naturally by enzymes of the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) family, i.e. nNOS/NOS1 (neuronal), iNOS/NOS2 (inducible) and eNOS/NOS3 (endothelial). These enzymes catalyze the conversion of L-arginine to citrulline and NO (Alderton et al., 2001). NO can either promote or inhibit angiogenesis, depending on the concentration and duration of exposure and the intrinsic sensitivity of cells to NO (Fukumura et al., 2006). NOS1 increases melanoma cell invasion by inducing NO overproduction (Yang et al., 2013). Aberrant NOS2 is associated with mechanisms to promote oncogenic pathways by redox modulation (Wink et al., 2011). NOS3 expression detected in breast cancer is positively associated with ER and progesterone receptor (PR) status (Vakkala et al., 2000).

In our previous studies, HCB increased angiogenesis and VEGF-A expression in a xenograft model with (ERα-) MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells, and in endothelial cells (Pontillo et al., 2015). In contrast, no studies on the action of CPF on breast cancer angiogenesis have been reported. The aim of the present study was to assess HCB and CPF mechanism of action on angiogenesis in breast cancer models. In a xenograft model with (ERα+) MCF-7 human breast cancer cells, we evaluated vascular density and VEGF-A expression, since we hypothesize that the pesticides treatment promotes alterations in blood vessels of mouse dermis and hypodermis, inducing angiogenic switch after that MCF-7 cells are injected. We think that the pesticides exposure enhances the expression and/or secretion of proangiogenic factors (VEGF, COX-2, NO) in breast cancer cells, which could impact on endothelial cells, increasing cell proliferation leading angiogenesis. To test the hypothesis, we used two *in vitro* approaches: 1) the MCF-7 breast cancer cells exposed to pesticides, where we examined COX-2, VEGF-A, NOS1, NOS2, and NOS3 protein levels and NO production, and 2) the neovasculogenesis assay, which evaluates the effect of MCF-7-derived conditioned medium on endothelial cells activation. Finally, we investigated whether NO, AhR and ER pathways are involved in the effects induced by pesticides.

## 2. Materials and methods

### 2.1. Chemicals

HCB (> 99% purity, commercial grade) was obtained from Aldrich-Chemie (Steinheim, Germany). CPF (99% purity) was purchased in Chem. Service Inc. (West Chester, PA, USA). Anti-COX-2 and anti-VEGF-A antibodies were obtained from Abcam Ltd. (Cambridge, UK). Anti-NOS1, NOS2 and NOS3 antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA). The specific inhibitors for NOS, L-NG-monomethyl Arginine citrate (L-NMMA) and for AhR, α-naphthoflavone (ANF), as well as anti-β-Actin antibody, 17β-estradiol, antibiotic-antimycotic, trypsin and glutamine were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St Louis, MO, USA). The specific inhibitor for ER, ICI 182,780 was obtained from Tocris Bioscience (St Louis, MO, USA). Matrigel was purchased from Becton Dickinson Biosciences (San José, CA). The enhanced chemiluminescence kit was from GE Healthcare Life Sciences (Buckinghamshire, UK). Fetal bovine serum (FBS) was obtained from Invitrogen Life Technology (Carlsbad, CA, USA). All other reagents used were of analytical grade.

### 2.2. Angiogenic switch assay

The (ERα+) MCF-7 breast cancer cells were used for induction of angiogenesis following Monte et al. (1994). Six-week-old female nude Swiss mice were maintained in a controlled and germ-free environment (24 ± 2°C, 50 ± 10% relative humidity, light/dark cycle 12–12 h). HCB (0.3, 3 and 30 mg/kg body weight; b.w.) or CPF (0.01, 0.1 and 1 mg/kg b.w.) dissolved in corn oil were administered to female mice by intraperitoneal injection (0.1 ml) three times a week during a month (*n* = 5). Mice were treated with 17β-estradiol by subcutaneous injection, 3 days prior to cells inoculation. Then, MCF-7 cells (5 × 10⁴) in 0.1 ml RPMI-1640 without FBS were inoculated intradermally into the area surrounding the third mammary fat pad of the mice. After 5 days, animals were euthanized in a CO₂ chamber, and photographs were taken of the angiogenic site of the skin to analyze vascular response. After that, skin (dermis and hypodermis) from the angiogenic site was carefully separated from underlying tissues with the scalpel, and was homogenized to evaluate VEGF-A expression as previously described Pontillo et al. (2015). All procedures were conducted in accordance with the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (CICUAL) at School of Medicine, University of Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires, Argentina (Res. 2975/2013).

The HCB and CPF concentrations used were taken from our previous studies and are similar to those found in the environment. HCB (0.3 and 3 mg/kg) increases mammary tumor volume and metastatic foci in mouse lungs (Pontillo et al., 2013). CPF (0.01 and 1 mg/kg) induces preneoplastic lesions in rat mammary gland (Ventura et al., 2016) and increases incidence of rat mammary tumors (Ventura et al., 2019). HCB levels were detected in serum of umbilical cord (1 mg/kg) and in maternal serum (0.6 mg/kg) in China (Guo et al., 2014). Although HCB absorption has not been determined in mice, it may be thought to resemble the values found in human populations. For instance, when HCB (500 mg/kg b.w. in water solution) was administered to rats by gavage for 5 days of each week during 4 weeks, the serum HCB concentration was 600 ng/ml (Chiappini et al., 2009). Assuming that HCB distribution is similar in rats and mice, we hypothesize that the administration of 3 mg/kg b.w. (in corn oil) in mice for 30 days, may render serum concentrations of at least 45 ng/ml. In this regard, To-Figueras et al. (1997) found 32 ng/ml of HCB in human serum. Besides, Ralph et al. (2003) have reported that HCB (5 mg/kg/day) produced androgenic effects in mice. In addition, CPF doses were selected taking into consideration the No Observed Adverse Effects Level (NOAEL, 1 mg/kg/day) and Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI, 0.01 mg/kg/day), reported by World Health Organization (WHO, 2009).

## 2.3. Cells and treatment

The MCF-7 cell line derived from human mammary adenocarcinoma (American Type Culture Collection), positive for ERα and PR, was cultured at 37 °C, in a 5% CO₂ incubator with RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% antibiotic-antimycotic mixture (10,000 units/ml penicillin, 10 mg/ml streptomycin sulfate, and 25 mg/ml amphotericin B), and 1% glutamine. Cells (6.5 × 10⁵) were seeded and, after 24 h of starvation and at 70–80% confluence, were exposed to HCB (0.005; 0.05; 0.5 and 5 μM) or CPF (0.05; 0.5; 5 and 50 μM) in RPMI-1640 with 3% FBS for 24 h. For time-course studies, cells were treated with HCB (0.005; 0.05; 0.5 and 5 μM) or CPF (0.05; 0.5 and 50 μM) in RPMI with 3% FBS for 3, 6 and 24 h. Ethanol (EtOH) was used as control whose final concentration (0.5%) did not influence the parameters analyzed. The samples were not pooled in cell culture. Independent assays were conducted, where each sample corresponds to an individual dose or time of pesticide exposure. All experiments were repeated at least 3 times and the results shown are representations of similar findings. For inhibitor treatments, cells were pretreated with non-selective inhibitor of NOS isoforms (L-NMMA, 0.1 mM) for 30 min and with inhibitors of AhR (ANF, 1 μM) and ER (ICI 182,780, 10 nM) for 1 h. Then, HCB, CPF or vehicle was added to the media in the presence or absence of inhibitors. L-NMMA is a relatively non-selective inhibitor of activities of all NOS isoforms ([Melikian et al., 2009](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.toxap.2009.01.010)). ICI treatment results in a reduction in ERα levels whilst having no effect on ERβ expression ([Martin et al., 2005](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.toxap.2005.01.010)). ANF acts as an AhR antagonist, therefore this receptor cannot recognize the specific DNA sequence of XRE ([Gasiewicz and Rucci, 1991](https://doi.org/10.1016/0041-008X(91)90004-F)).

HCB doses were selected either to induce cell proliferation (0.005 μM) or promote apoptosis (5 μM) in MCF-7 ([García et al., 2010](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.toxap.2010.01.010)). In turn, CPF doses were chosen to either increase proliferation (0.05 μM) or reduce it (50 μM) ([Ventura et al., 2012](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.toxap.2012.01.010)). HCB 5 μM is similar to the concentration found in human serum from a highly contaminated population ([To-Figueras et al., 1997](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0041-008X(97)00004-0)) and it is reasonable to assume that the lowest HCB doses are environmentally relevant to the general population. HCB (0.05 μM) is similar to that observed in human serum from the general population in France ([Saoudi et al., 2014](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.toxap.2014.01.010)). The lowest concentration of CPF chosen is similar to environmental values found in water or soil ([Loewy et al., 2011](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.toxap.2011.01.010)).

### 2.4. Western blotting

At the end of the *in vitro* assays, each well was washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and the total cell lysates were obtained in lysis buffer (0.1 M Tris-HCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM EGTA, 0.1 mM NaF, 0.02 mg/ml leupeptin, 1 mM Na₃VO₄, 1 mM phenyl methane-sulfonyl fluoride, PMSF) using a scraper. They were centrifuged at 16,000 xg for 10 min at 4 °C to discard the DNA precipitate, and then, the supernatants were stored at −80 °C. Tissue samples (dermis and hypodermis) were immediately homogenized in 200 μl of buffer 10 mM Tris-HCl, 5 mM MgCl₂, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1% Triton-X 100, 50 mM NaF, 0.1 mM Na₃VO₄ (pH 7.4), and protease inhibitors 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 mM PMSF, 50 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor. The homogenates were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C and the resulting supernatants were stored at −80 °C. Protein concentration was analyzed by the Bradford method ([Bradford, 1976](https://doi.org/10.1016/0003-2697(76)90580-2)) using bovine serum albumin (1 mg/ml) as the standard protein. The secretion of VEGF-A was evaluated in the conditioned medium of the MCF-7 cells, and the VEGF-A expression was analyzed in MCF-7 cell lysates and mouse tissue homogenates. Whole-cell lysates, tissue homogenates and an equal volume of conditioned media were electrophoresed on a 7.5–10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, prior to transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, in a semi-dry transfer cell at 18 V for 1.5 h. Membranes were blocked overnight and then incubated with anti-VEGF-A (1:500), anti-COX-2 (1:500), anti-NOS1 (1:250), anti-NOS2 (1:250) or anti-NOS3 (1:250) antibodies, and proceeded to analyze the samples by testing

Western blot as described [Peña et al. (2012)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.toxap.2012.01.010). Monoclonal anti-β-Actin (1:2000) antibody was used as a charge control.

### 2.5. Nitric oxide determination

NO production was determined by measuring nitrite (NO₂⁻) accumulation in culture supernatants. Cells (30,000) were seeded at least in triplicate in 96-well plates with 100 μl of RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% FBS. After replacing with fresh medium supplemented with 0.5% FBS, cells were treated with HCB (0.005; 0.05; 0.5 and 5 μM), CPF (0.05; 0.5; 5 and 50 μM) or vehicle in RPMI-1640 without FBS and phenol red free, for 24 h. In the time-course assays, cells were treated with HCB (0.005 and 5 μM), CPF (0.05 and 50 μM) or vehicle for 3, 6 and 24 h. Nitrite accumulation was evaluated in culture supernatants by Griess reagent as described [Español et al. (2015)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.toxap.2015.01.010). Values are mean ± SD of at least four experiments.

### 2.6. Neovascularization assay

EA.hy926 endothelial cells, derived from the fusion of human umbilical vein endothelial cells with the cell line A549 (human lung carcinoma) and obtained from the ATCC company, were maintained in DMEM FBS 10%. MCF-7 cells were treated with HCB (0.005 μM), CPF (50 μM) or vehicle during 24 h, and the conditioned media was collected. The matrigel (50 μl) was gelled at 37 °C for 30 min in 96-well plates, where the EA.hy926 cells were then seeded in DMEM FBS 10%, along with the conditioned medium from the MCF-7 cells previously treated with pesticides (⅓ of fresh DMEM and ⅔ of conditioned media). The formation of capillary-like structures was photographed 24 h later and the total tube length and the number of branch points were quantified using the Image J program. Each of the wells was fully quantified, both for the total tube length and for the number of branch points. The results of the wells with the conditioned medium of the MCF-7 cells were compared with the control wells treated with ethanol. Values are expressed as percentage of total tube length and the number of branch points respect to control values.

### 2.7. Statistical analysis

The data were evaluated by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey post hoc test to identify significant differences between controls and treatments. The differences were considered significant when the \( p \) values were \( p < .05 \). The results represent the mean ± SD of at least three independent experiments.

## 3. Results

### 3.1. Effect of HCB and CPF on angiogenesis in a MCF-7 xenograft model

One of the events more important for tumors progress is the induction of angiogenic switch ([Bergers and Benjamin, 2003](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0092-8674(03)00024-6)). To examine whether HCB or CPF exposure promotes angiogenesis *in vivo*, we worked in a xenograft model exposed to these pesticides with MCF-7 cells. First, we analyzed the angiogenic switch quantifying number of blood vessels and, second, we evaluated VEGF-A expression in mouse skin (dermis and hypodermis). Our results showed that the administration of E2 had no effect on the number of blood vessels and, when injecting MCF-7 tumor cells, a significant increase in angiogenesis was observed, similar to that of vehicle application (*skin + E2 + MCF-7 cells + vehicle*) (Supplementary Fig. 1). HCB induced an enhancement in angiogenic switch at 3 mg/kg (90%), associated with an increase in VEGF-A levels (71%) ([Fig. 1A and C](#fig1)). Besides, CPF (0.1 mg/kg) promoted angiogenic switch (25%) and VEGF-A expression (56%), also rendering increased levels of this factor at 1 mg/kg (54%) ([Fig. 1B and D](#fig1)). These results show a pattern of nonmonotonic dose-response curves, typically observed for many EDs that interact with hormonal

receptors (Vandenberg et al., 2013; Welshons et al., 2003).

### 3.2. HCB and CPF increase the levels of VEGF-A and COX-2 in MCF-7 cells

VEGF-A is a key growth factor which is highly upregulated in tumors and controls anarchic neovascularization (Welti et al., 2013). Since HCB and CPF increase VEGF-A levels *in vivo*, we tested the hypothesis that these pesticides may increase this factor expression in

MCF-7 cells. The VEGF-A secretion was evaluated in conditioned medium of the cells, whereas intracellular VEGF-A levels were analyzed in whole-cell lysates. Our results show that HCB induced VEGF-A secretion at lower doses (116% at 0.005, and 185% at 0.05 μM), while intracellular VEGF-A rose in almost all assayed doses (128% at 0.005, 73% at 0.5, and 94% at 5 μM) (Fig. 2A and C). On the other hand, high doses of CPF augmented both VEGF-A secretion (119% at 5 and 84% at 50 μM) and intracellular VEGF-A levels (76% at 5 and 54% at 50 μM)

**Fig. 2. Dose-response of HCB and CPF effects on VEGF-A and COX-2 expression in MCF-7, and neovascularization assay.** MCF-7 cells were treated with HCB (0.005, 0.05, 0.5, and 5 μM) or CPF (0.05, 0.5, 5 and 50 μM) or vehicle during 24 h. MCF-7-conditioned media was collected, and whole-cell lysates were prepared to measure VEGF-A secretion, and VEGF-A and COX-2 expression by Western blot. VEGF-A and COX-2 protein levels in (A) HCB- or (B) CPF-treated cells. Secreted VEGF-A levels in HCB- or CPF-treated cells (C). Intracellular protein levels were relativized to β-Actin expression. One representative experiment is shown in the upper panels. Quantification by densitometry scanning of the immunoblots is shown in the lower panels. Photographs of capillary-like tube formation in Matrigel with endothelial cells exposed to conditioned media from MCF-7 cells treated with HCB (0.005 μM) or CPF (50 μM) are shown in upper panel, and the total tube length and branching points were calculated and represented as mean ± SD in lower panels (D). Data are expressed as means ± SD of at least three independent experiments. Asterisks indicate significant differences vs. control (*p < .05, **p < .01, ***p < .001), ANOVA and Tukey post-hoc test.

(Fig. 2B and C).

In breast cancer, COX-2 overexpression is associated with characteristics of aggressive disease (Howe, 2007). In order to evaluate if HCB and CPF induce changes on COX-2 levels, we analyzed the expression of this protein by Western blot. HCB exposure significantly increased COX-2 expression at all doses assayed (133% at 0.005, 141% at 0.05, 129% at 0.5 and 148% at 5 μM) (Fig. 2A). Similar results were obtained in the presence of CPF (143% at 0.05, 94% at 0.5, 92% at 5, and 126% at 50 μM) (Fig. 2B).

### 3.3. In vitro neovascularization assay

Taken into account that HCB and CPF promote angiogenesis in a xenograft model, and increase VEGF-A secretion in MCF-7 cells, we

evaluated the effect of conditioned media from MCF-7 treated with pesticides on in vitro tube-like structure formation of endothelial cells EA.hy926. MCF-7 cells were exposed to pesticide concentrations that induced VEGF-A secretion: HCB (0.005 μM) or CPF (50 μM) for 24 h. Next, conditioned media were collected and EA.hy926 cells were treated during 24 h in Matrigel. Our data indicate that HCB and CPF significantly induce neovascularization, enhancing total tube length (380 and 610%, respectively) as well as branching points (185 and 190%, respectively) (Fig. 2D).

### 3.4. Pesticides induce dose-response alterations in NOS expression and NO production in MCF-7 cells

Given that NO can promote or inhibit angiogenesis, depending on

MCF-7 cells were treated with HCB (0.005, 0.05, 0.5, and 5 μM) or CPF (0.05, 0.5, 5 and 50 μM) during 24 h. Cell-conditioned media were collected to quantify NO production by Griess reagent.

concentration and duration of exposure (Fukumura et al., 2006), we examined whether pesticides induce alterations in NO production in MCF-7 cells. HCB reduced NO levels at 0.05 μM (25%) (Fig. 3A), while CPF increased NO production at 0.5 μM (84%), but decreased it at 0.05 and 5 μM (42 and 48%, respectively) (Fig. 3B).

To investigate the action of HCB and CPF on NOS expression, we treated cells with HCB (0.005, 0.05, 0.5, and 5 μM) or CPF (0.05, 0.5, 5, and 50 μM) for 24 h, and then analyzed NOS1, NOS2 and NOS3 levels by Western blot. Results show that HCB boosted NOS1 expression at 0.005 μM (175%) but reduced it at 0.05, 0.5, and 5 μM (55, 60 and 50%, respectively) (Fig. 3C). Conversely, CPF increased NOS1 levels at 0.5 and 50 μM (55 and 70%, respectively) (Fig. 3D). In addition, we

found that HCB treatment decreased NOS2 expression at all doses assayed (25, 50, 40 and 35%, respectively) (Fig. 3C), but CPF augmented it at 50 μM (155%) (Fig. 3D). Finally, NOS3 results revealed that HCB reduced levels (45% at 0.05 μM) (Fig. 3c), while CPF increased them (110% at 50 μM) (Fig. 3D).

### 3.5. Time-course effects of HCB and CPF on VEGF-A and COX-2 expression in MCF-7 cells

Taking into account the results mentioned above, where HCB exposure did not induce an increase in NO release, we decided to study pesticide effects in time-course at shorter exposure times. Considering works which NOS increase their expression at short times of treatment (Morán et al., 2010), we performed time-course exposure at 3, 6, and 24 h at low and high doses. We have previously reported that HCB (0.005 μM) induces cell proliferation, while 5 μM it triggers apoptosis in MCF-7 (García et al., 2010). In addition, we have observed that CPF increases proliferation at 0.05 μM, but reduces it at 50 μM in MCF-7 (Ventura et al., 2012). Therefore, we chose to work at 0.005 and 5 μM HCB doses and 0.05 and 50 μM CPF concentrations to evaluate VEGF-A and COX-2 levels.

As shown in Fig. 4A, HCB exposure augmented VEGF-A levels at 3 and 24 h (42 and 157%) at 0.005 μM, but only at 24 h (100%) at 5 μM. In addition, CPF treatment increased VEGF-A expression at 6 h (33%) at 0.05 μM, and at 3 and 24 h (102 and 54%, respectively) at 50 μM (Fig. 4B). Our results in COX-2 assays show that HCB increased COX-2 expression at all exposure times at 0.05 μM (54, 156 and 154%, respectively), but only at 24 h (167%) at 5 μM (Fig. 4A). Similar results were observed with CPF, boosting COX-2 levels at 6 and 24 h (113 and 145%, respectively) at 0.05 μM, but only at 24 h (128%) at 50 μM (Fig. 4B).

#### 3.6. Time-course expression of NOS proteins and NO production by HCB and CPF in MCF-7 cells

After observing an incremental increase in VEGF-A and COX-2 levels in MCF-7 cells exposed to both pesticides at early times, we evaluated NO release at 3, 6 and 24 h using HCB (0.005 and 5 μM) or CPF (0.05 and 50 μM). HCB increased NO levels only at 3 h (22%) at low dose but reduced them at the same time (31%) at high dose (Fig. 5A). In the presence of CPF, NO production rose at 3 and 6 h (59 and 39%, respectively) at low dose, while it decreased at 6 h (51%) at high dose (Fig. 5B).

Subsequently, we studied whether pesticides could affect NOS expression. HCB augmented NOS1 levels only at 24 h (164%) at 0.005 μM but reduced it at all times (65, 61 and 41%, respectively) at 5 μM (Fig. 5C). On the other hand, CPF increased NOS1 expression at 6 h (31%) at 0.05 μM and at 24 h (74%) at 50 μM but reduced it at 3 h both at 0.05 μM (25%) and 5 μM (32%) and at 6 h at high dose (38%) (Fig. 5D). In the case of NOS2, HCB enhanced its expression only at 3 h (45%) with 0.005 μM, reducing levels at 24 h at both low and high doses (25 and 32%, respectively) (Fig. 5C). Conversely, CPF increased NOS2 expression at 3 and 6 h (62 and 41%, respectively) at 0.05 μM and at 24 h (139%) at 50 μM (Fig. 5D). When the effects on NOS3 were

analyzed, we observed that HCB augmented its levels only at 3 h (85%) with 0.005 μM but reduced them at 3 and 6 h (61 and 45%, respectively) with 5 μM (Fig. 5C). NOS3 expression increased after CPF exposure at 6 and 24 h (62 and 59%, respectively) at low dose, and at 3, 6 and 24 h (90, 69 and 134%, respectively) at high dose (Fig. 5D).

3.7. Role of AhR, ER and NO in HCB- or CPF-induced VEGF-A and COX-2 expression

Studies from our laboratory have reported that HCB and CPF act as EDs in breast cancer and mammary gland, and that some of their toxic effects could be induced through AhR and ER activation (Ventura et al., 2012, 2016). To determine whether pesticide-induced VEGF-A and COX-2 levels depend on mechanisms involving these receptors, MCF-7 was preincubated with specific inhibitors ANF for AhR, and ICI 182,780 for ER. Cells were then exposed to HCB (0.005 and 5 μM) or CPF (0.05 and 50 μM) in the presence or absence of inhibitors. The times of pesticide exposure were selected taking into account data showed in Fig. 4. Results clearly demonstrated that 0.005 μM HCB induced both VEGF-A and COX-2 levels through an AhR-dependent mechanism, while 5 μM HCB only impacted COX-2 in an AhR-dependent manner (Fig. 6A). Regarding CPF effects, the AhR pathway is not involved in pesticide-

###induced VEGF-A levels but mediated the increase in COX-2 expression at low and high doses (Fig. 6B). In turn, the ER pathway mediated 0.005 μM HCB inductions of both VEGF-A and COX-2 expression, but only ER is involved in 5 μM HCB effects on COX-2 levels (Fig. 6A). In addition, CPF effects only mediated the activation of ER at a low dose on VEGF-A expression (Fig. 6B).

Given the key role that NO plays in angiogenesis, we examined whether it could participate in the increase in VEGF-A and COX-2 proteins induced by pesticides. For this purpose, we chose to work at low doses of the toxics, which had rendered an increase in VEGF-A, COX-2 and NOS expression, and in NO production (Figs. 4 and 5). Results show that preincubation with L-NMMA, an inhibitor for all NOS, prevented the increase in the levels of VEGF-A and COX-2 induced by HCB or CPF (Fig. 6A-B), indicating that the rise in these factors induced by pesticides depends on NO release.

In addition, we tested whether inhibitors without pesticide exposure could have an action on VEGF-A and COX-2 levels. The results show that the treatments with the different inhibitors do not induce significant changes in the protein levels of these proangiogenic factors (Supplementary Fig. 2).

### 4. Discussion

The endocrine disruptive action of some pesticides has generated particular concerns due to the hormonal nature of many well-known risk factors for breast cancer. Several reports suggest that organochlorine and organophosphate compounds may be associated with breast cancer risk (Bonefeld-Jørgensen et al., 2001; Ellsworth et al., 2015; Engel et al., 2017), urging studies of environmental risk factors which could facilitate interventions to reduce this disease. The *in vivo* assays from the present study show that HCB (3 mg/kg) and CPF (0.1 mg/kg) stimulate vascular density and VEGF-A expression in a xenograft model with (ERα+) MCF-7 cells, demonstrating that CPF has an effect at a dose 30 times lower than that of HCB. Similar results have been seen in a xenograft model exposed to HCB with breast cancer (ERα-) MDA-MB-231 cells (Pontillo et al., 2015), indicating that this pesticide exerts its effect on both breast ERα-positive and -negative cancer cells. In a MDA-MB-231 model and in a syngeneic model with C4-HI (PR+, ER+) tumors, HCB (3 mg/kg) increased tumor growth and spontaneous metastasis in mouse lung and liver (Pontillo et al., 2013), as well as induced ductal hyperplasia in mouse mammary gland (Miret et al., 2017). Besides, CPF (0.01 and 1 mg/kg) increased number of mammary ducts and preneoplastic lesions in rats (Ventura et al., 2016). In agreement with these results, other authors have demonstrated that CPF (0.1 and 2.5 mg/kg) enhances the number of terminal end buds on rat mammary glands (Nishi and Hundal, 2013). A recent study in a rat mammary model has reported that CPF (0.01 and 1 mg/kg) augmented tumor incidence (Ventura et al., 2019).

NO exerts multiple effects on tumor biology, with the ability to either inhibit or stimulate cell proliferation, migration and apoptosis (Burke et al., 2013). Our results *in vitro* show that low doses of HCB and CPF increase NO production as well as NOS1, NOS2 and NOS3 expression, suggesting an association between both effects. In agreement, bisfenol S stimulates NO release in ovarian granulosa cells, increasing vessels growth (Berni et al., 2019). Moreover, Zhu et al. (2017) have reported that NOS1 promotes the survival of nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells. In mammary tumors with poor prognosis (ERα-), NOS2 is a marker of a worse survival subgroup (Glynn et al., 2010). In addition, in ERα+ mammary tumors, NOS2 expression was associated with Akt activation (Prueitt et al., 2007). Organochlorine pesticides lindane and chlordane increase proliferation, migration and production of NO via NOS3 in an ERα-dependent manner in HUVEC cells (Clere et al., 2012). Likewise, there is a relationship between ERα, NOS3 and VEGF-A in endothelial cells, which also involves Akt activation. Therefore, estrogens could activate the release of NO contributing to tumor survival (Xu et al., 2002). We have reported that HCB increases Akt activation in rat

mammary tumors (Peña et al., 2012). In view of our results, we hypothesize that the pesticides at low doses stimulate ERα, triggering NOS2/NOS3 activation and increasing NO release. On the other hand, at high doses of HCB, NO production decreases coincidentally with a reduction in NOS expression in MCF-7. NO is a mediator of apoptosis, and there is evidence that low NO concentrations act as a cytoprotective stimulus (Mannick et al., 1999). However, CPF (50 μM) decreases NO production, an effect accompanied by an increase in NOS expression. Considering the reported action of inhibition of acetylcholinesterase by organophosphates, muscarinic receptors might be stimulated and increase NOS expression, as observed by Fiszman et al. (2007) in MCF-7. Also, CPF (50 μM) augments reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, which promotes ERK1/2 phosphorylation and leads to MCF-7 proliferation inhibition and cycle arrest (Ventura et al., 2015). NO regulates a wide range of intracellular events through s-nitrosylation and redox regulation (Switzer et al., 2012). Herein, the production of NO may be reduced due to an increase in ROS, in line with reports showing that redox environment affects NO behavior. ROS generated during metabolism play an important role in the progression of cancer (Acharya et al., 2010).

VEGF-A secreted by tumor cells promote angiogenesis and tumor growth (Breslin et al., 2003). In the current work, we have demonstrated for the first time that HCB and CPF at low doses upregulate VEGF-A intracellular levels in breast cancer cells, although only HCB induces an increase in VEGF-A secretion. At high doses, both pesticides augment VEGF-A intracellular levels, but CPF also increases VEGF-A secretion, without changes upon HCB exposure. In line with these results, benzo[a]pyrene and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane stimulate VEGF-A expression in MCF-7 (Malik et al., 2018; Bratton et al., 2012). In addition, herein, at the same doses which VEGF-A secretion is enhanced, we observed an increase in tubulogenesis with endothelial cells exposed to conditioned media from MCF-7 treated with pesticides, indicating that angiogenic factors released by tumor cells stimulate tube-like formation. The angiogenic switch is a discrete step that depends on the tumor and its microenvironment (Bergers and Benjamin, 2003). Our *in vitro* assay demonstrated that pesticides modulate MCF-7 breast cancer cells, enhancing the production of proangiogenic factors, which ultimately activate endothelial cells and increase neovascularization. On the other hand, in the *in vivo* trial we try to evaluate the effect of the pesticides on the microenvironment. That is why mice are exposed to the pesticides prior to inoculation of MCF-7 cells. Here we could clearly observe that the treatment alters the microenvironment so that, at the time of injecting the MCF-7 cells, the angiogenic switch is produced quickly. All of these results together prove that pesticides modulate both the tumor cells and its microenvironment, promoting angiogenesis. HCB and CPF are weak ligands of AhR, a transcription factor involved in cell physiology and tumor development (Roman et al., 2009). The present data indicate that VEGF-A induction is mediated by AhR only at low HCB dose; conversely CPF effect on VEGF-A did not involve AhR. On the other hand, there is no evidence recorded to date on the effects of CPF on breast cancer angiogenesis. EDs mimic, damage or antagonize endocrine signaling pathways through interaction with hormone receptors, including ER (Shanle and Xu, 2011). Herein, low doses of HCB and CPF increased VEGF-A through an ER mechanism, in line with a report by Clere et al. (2012), lindane and chlordane increase VEGF-A levels in HUVEC involving ER. Furthermore, our results suggest that the increment in VEGF-A protein is mediated by NO release. In agreement, Ambs et al. (1998) reported that NO stimulates VEGF-A expression, increasing tumor vascularization. In this way, NO generated by intratumor NOS promote formation of new blood vessels to enhance VEGF-A. This neovascularization increases not only tumor proliferation, but also its invasiveness and metastatic capacity (Xu et al., 2002).

Several studies have demonstrated that COX-2 protein is a fundamental proangiogenic factor associated with cell migration, invasion, metastasis and poor prognosis in different types of tumors (Wang et al.,
L.V. Zárate, et al.

Fig. 7. Model of mechanism of action of pesticides in MCF-7 cells. Low doses of (A) HCB and (B) CPF, and high doses of (C) HCB and (D) CPF. (A, B) The compounds enter the cell and bind to AhR, triggering the nuclear pathway where the toxic/AhR complex translocates to the nucleus, forms a heterodimer with AhR nuclear translocator protein (ARNT) and acts as a transcription factor, increasing COX-2 and VEGF-A expression. In addition, the pesticides activate ER, which could be involved in enhance levels of VEGF-A or COX-2. On the other hand, NO can augment the levels of COX-2 and VEGF-A, contributing to a proliferative and proangiogenic environment. Besides, HCB enhances VEGF-A secretion, promoting tubulogenesis in endothelial cells. (C) HCB joins to AhR, triggering the nuclear pathway. Through an unknown mechanism, HCB could stimulate ER so that it induces the expression of COX-2. At the same time, NOS expression decreases, generating a drop in NO production which could contribute to the apoptotic process. (D) CPF could bind to AhR receptor, triggering the nuclear pathway, increasing COX-2 levels. However, up to this moment, we do not know why signaling pathway enhances the VEGF-A expression. CPF increases the release of angiogenic factors (VEGF-A) promoting tubulogenesis in endothelial cells. In addition, CPF enhances NOS levels but reduces NO production.

2019; Hashemi Goradel et al., 2019). Upregulation of COX-2 in human breast cancer was associated with increased tumor angiogenesis (Davies et al., 2003). In the present study, both pesticides enhanced COX-2 levels at low and high doses and with a similar pattern. Bisphenol A induces COX-2 expression and augments invasion in human uterine cells (Wang et al., 2013). In addition, benzo[a]pyrene increases COX-2 mRNA levels in MCF-7, promoting an inflammatory microenvironment (Malik et al., 2018). Both COX-2 overexpression and AhR activation

L.V. Zárate, *et al.*

play a key role in the etiology of mammary tumorigenesis (Schlezinger *et al.*, 2006), and results of the present investigation clearly demonstrate that both pesticides upregulate COX-2 expression through AhR pathway. HCB also increases COX-2 levels involving AhR in endothelial cells (Pontillo *et al.*, 2015). Some ligands of AhR induce COX-2 mRNA by binding to XRE sites on COX-2 promoter (Haarmann-Stemmann *et al.*, 2009). In addition, HCB enhances COX-2 expression through an ER mechanism, as different from CPF, whose action is not mediated by this receptor. On the other hand, NO pathway mediates the increment in COX-2 levels induced by pesticides. Interestingly, Salvemini *et al.* (1993) showed that an enhancement in NO content induces the expression of COX-2. In turn, the downregulation of COX-2 decreases the invasive and metastatic capacities of MCF-7, suppressing the proliferation and reducing VEGF-A expression (Yang and Han, 2014). PGE2 mediates EP4 receptor activation in cancer cells, resulting in an aberrant expression of COX-2 which promotes breast cancer progression and angiogenesis (Xin *et al.*, 2012). The action of pesticides observed in this study on COX-2 and VEGF-A reinforces the idea of co-regulation between them, driving positive proangiogenic feedback in breast cancer cells. These findings suggest that when MCF-7 cells are exposed to the pesticides, COX-2 levels could initially increase, and PGE2 production may positively regulate VEGF-A expression.

Taking into account data of the present work and previous results, we propose a model of mechanism of action at low pesticide doses (0.005 μM HCB and 0.05 μM CPF) (Fig. 7A-B), and another model at high doses (5 μM HCB and 50 μM CPF) (Fig. 7C-D). Low doses of HCB (0.005 μM) and CPF (0.05 μM) in MCF-7 clearly enhance VEGF-A and COX-2 expression, accompanied by an increase in NOS levels and the release of NO. This is in line with a recent investigation in which HCB (0.005 μM) promoted cell cycle progression, augmenting cyclin D1 expression and inducing interaction between c-Src and p27 in MCF-7 (Ventura *et al.*, 2017), and with previous studies showing that CPF (0.05 μM) induce proliferation in MCF-7 mediated by ERα (Ventura *et al.*, 2012). Besides, conditioned media from MCF-7 treated with HCB (0.005 μM) enhanced neovasculogenesis in endothelial cells (Fig. 7A-B). On the other hand, high doses of HCB (5 μM) and CPF (50 μM) increase VEGF-A and COX-2 levels. Conversely, the action on NOS expression was clearly distinct, given that HCB reduces levels while CPF increases them. However, both pesticides decrease the production of NO, while only CPF induced the release of angiogenic factors that stimulate tubulogenesis in endothelial cells. MCF-7 treated with HCB (5 μM) showed apoptosis and upregulation of CYP1A1 expression, an AhR target gene (García *et al.*, 2010). In addition, the same dose of HCB promotes the formation of cyclin E-CDK2-p27 complex, delaying progression of the MCF-7 cell cycle (Ventura *et al.*, 2017). Finally, CPF (50 μM) causes MCF-7 cell cycle arrest and decreases proliferation, increasing ROS which promote ERK1/2 phosphorylation and lead to necrosis (Ventura *et al.*, 2015), (Fig. 7C-D).

### 5. Conclusion

The results of the present study demonstrate for the first time that environmentally relevant concentrations of HCB similar to sera of human populations, as well as relevant CPF concentrations close to the ADI and the NOAEL, induce the angiogenic switch and VEGF-A expression in a mouse model with MCF-7 cells. In addition, we note that pesticides enhance the expression of VEGF-A and COX-2, as well as NO production in human breast cancer cells MCF-7, promoting the release of angiogenic factors that stimulate tubulogenesis in endothelial cells. These findings show that pesticide exposure could stimulate angiogenesis, a process that has been demonstrated to contribute to breast cancer progression.
