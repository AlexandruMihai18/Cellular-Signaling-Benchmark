**Abstract** Pancreatic β-cell dysfunction and insulin resistance are observed in type 2 diabetes. Under diabetic conditions, oxidative stress and ER stress are induced in various tissues, leading to activation of the JNK pathway. This JNK activation suppresses insulin biosynthesis and interferes with insulin action. Indeed, suppression of the JNK pathway in diabetic mice improves insulin resistance and ameliorates glucose tolerance. Thus, the JNK pathway plays a central role in pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes and may be a potential target for diabetes therapy.

**Introduction**

The development of type 2 diabetes is associated with a combination of pancreatic β-cell dysfunction and insulin resistance [1, 2]. Normal β-cells can compensate for insulin resistance by increasing insulin secretion or β-cell mass, but insufficient compensation leads to the onset of glucose intolerance. Chronic hyperglycemia is a cause of impairment of insulin biosynthesis and secretion; once hyperglycemia becomes apparent, β-cell function gradually deteriorates and insulin resistance aggravates [3–7]. This process is called “glucose toxicity”. Under such conditions, oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress are provoked and the c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway is activated in various tissues. Here we show a role of oxidative stress, ER stress, and the JNK pathway in diabetes.

**Oxidative stress and pancreatic β-cell dysfunction**

Oxidative stress is provoked in various tissues under diabetic conditions, and is involved in the development of diabetic complications [8–13]. Pancreatic β-cells are also thought to be a target of oxidative stress-mediated tissue damage [14–26]. β-cells express the high Km glucose transporter GLUT2 and thereby display highly efficient glucose uptake when exposed to high glucose concentrations. Indeed, it has been shown that expression of the oxidative stress markers 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and 4-hydroxy-2,3-nonenal (4-HNE) is increased in islets under diabetic conditions [12, 13]. In addition, due to

their relatively low expression of antioxidant enzymes such as catalase and glutathione peroxidase [27, 28], β-cells are rather vulnerable to oxidative stress. Thus, it is likely that oxidative stress is involved in β-cell deterioration in type 2 diabetes. There are several sources of reactive oxygen species (ROS) productions in cells: the non-enzymatic glycosylation reaction [14, 15], the mitochondrial electron transport chain [10, 11], and the hexosamine pathway [21]. In diabetic animals, glycation is observed in various tissues and organs, and various kinds of glycated proteins are produced through the glycation reaction. During this reaction which in turn produces Schiff bases, Amadori products and advanced glycosylation end products (AGE), ROS are also produced [14]. Superoxide anions(O₂⁻) are initially produced, and then hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) and hydroxyl radicals are produced. The electron transport chain in the mitochondria is also likely to be an important pathway for the production of ROS (Fig. 1). In the electron transport chain, the superoxide anion (O₂⁻) is initially produced. It has been suggested that mitochondrial overwork, which results in an induction of ROS generation, is a potential mechanism causing the impairment of the first phase of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion found in the early stage of diabetes [23] as well as diabetic complications [10, 11].

As shown previously, the glycation reaction suppresses transcription of the insulin gene in β-cells by provoking oxidative stress. When β-cell-derived HIT cells were exposed to D-ribose, a strong reducing sugar, insulin gene promoter activity and mRNA expression were suppressed, whereas no such changes were observed for the β-actin gene [15]. These effects were neutralized by aminoguanidine, an inhibitor of the glycation reaction, or N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), an antioxidant, indicating that D-ribose suppresses insulin gene transcription by provoking oxidative stress via the glycation reaction. Pancreatic and duodenal homeobox factor-1 (PDX-1), also known as IDX-1/STF-1/IPF1 [29–31], is a member of the homeodomain-containing transcription factor family. PDX-1 is expressed in the pancreas and the duodenum and plays a crucial role in pancreatic development [32–40], β-cell differentiation/regeneration [41–51], and in maintaining normal β-cell function by regulating multiple important β-cell genes, including insulin, GLUT2, and glucokinase [52–60]. Clinically, mutations in PDX-1 are known to cause some cases of maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) [61]. The DNA-binding activity of PDX-1 is rather sensitive to oxidative stress, which may explain the reduction in the insulin gene promoter activity by oxidative stress; when HIT cells were exposed to D-ribose, PDX-1 binding to the insulin gene was markedly reduced, which was prevented by aminoguanidine or NAC [15]. Taken together, chronic hyperglycemia suppresses insulin biosynthesis and secretion by provoking oxidative stress through various pathways, accompanied by a reduction of PDX-1 DNA binding activity (Fig. 2).

Next, to evaluate the potential usefulness of antioxidants in treatment for type 2 diabetes, obese diabetic C57BL/KsJ-db/db mice were treated with antioxidants (NAC plus vitamins C and E) and the effects were assessed [16]. The antioxidant treatment resulted in retained glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and moderately decreased blood glucose levels. The β-cell mass was significantly greater in the mice treated with the antioxidants. Antioxidant treatment also suppressed apoptosis in the β-cell population without changing the rate of β-cell proliferation. The insulin content and insulin mRNA levels were also preserved by the antioxidant treatment. Furthermore, PDX-1 expression was more clearly visible in the nuclei of islet cells after the antioxidant treatment [16]. Similar effects were observed with Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats, another animal model of type 2 diabetes [17]. Taken together, these data indicate that antioxidant treatment can protect β-cells against glucose toxicity. In addition, as a step to clinical trial of antioxidant for type 2 diabetes, we investigated the possible anti-diabetic effects of probucol, an antioxidant widely used as an anti-hyperlipidemic agent, on preservation of β-cell function in diabetic C57BL/KsJ-db/db mice [13]. Immunostaining for oxidative stress markers such as 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE)-modified proteins and heme oxygenase-1 revealed that probucol treatment decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in pancreatic islets of diabetic animals. Probucol treatment preserved the β-cell mass, the insulin content, and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, leading to improvement of glucose tolerance

### The JNK pathway and pancreatic β-cell dysfunction

Several signal transduction pathways, including the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) [also known as stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK)] [62–65], p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK), and protein kinase C (PKC) cascades are activated by oxidative stress in various cell types, including pancreatic β-cells. It has been reported that activation of JNK is involved in the oxidative stress-induced reduction of insulin gene expression and that suppression of the JNK pathway can protect β-cells from oxidative stress [66]. When isolated rat islets were exposed to oxidative stress, the JNK, p38 MAPK, and PKC pathways were activated preceding the decrease in insulin gene expression. Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of dominant-negative type JNK1 (DN-JNK), but neither the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 nor the PKC inhibitor GF109203X, protected insulin gene expression and secretion from oxidative stress. Moreover, wild type JNK1 (WT-JNK) overexpression suppressed both insulin gene expression and secretion [66]. These results were correlated with changes in the binding of the transcription factor PDX-1 to the insulin promoter; adenoviral overexpression of DN-JNK preserved PDX-1 DNA binding activity in the face of oxidative stress, while WT-JNK overexpression decreased PDX-1 DNA binding activity [66]. Thus, it is likely that JNK-mediated suppression of PDX-1 DNA binding activity accounts for some of this suppression of insulin gene transcription and β-cell function, which fits with the phenomenon that PDX-1 expression and DNA binding activity is decreased in association with the reduction of insulin gene transcription seen after chronic exposure to a high glucose concentration. Taken together, it is likely that activation of the JNK pathway leads to decreased PDX-1 activity and subsequent suppression of insulin gene transcription in the diabetic state (Fig. 3). Furthermore, as a potential mechanism for JNK-mediated PDX-1 inactivation, it has recently been reported that PDX-1 is translocated from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in response to oxidative stress. When β-cell-derived HIT cells were subjected to oxidative stress, both the endogenously expressed PDX-1 and the exogenously introduced green fluorescent protein (GFP) tagged PDX-1 moved from the nuclei to the cytoplasm [67] (Fig. 3). Addition of DN-JNK inhibited this oxidative stress-induced PDX-1 translocation, suggesting an essential role for JNK in mediating this phenomenon. Whereas the nuclear localization signal in PDX-1 was not affected by oxidative stress, leptomycin B, a specific inhibitor of the classic leucine-rich nuclear export signal, inhibited the nuclear-cytoplasmic translocation of PDX-1 induced by oxidative stress. Indeed, we have identified a nuclear export signal at position 82–94 of the mouse PDX-1 protein [67].

To examine whether DN-JNK can protect β-cells from the toxic effects of hyperglycemia and to explore its potential therapeutic application for islet transplantation, transplantation into diabetic mice was performed [66]. Isolated rat islets were infected with an adenoviral vector expressing dominant-negative JNK (Ad-DN-JNK) or Ad-GFP and cultured for 2 days, then 500 islets were transplanted under the kidney capsules of STZ-induced diabetic Swiss nude mice. Blood glucose levels were not significantly decreased by transplantation of islets infected with Ad-GFP, which was probably due to the toxic effects of hyperglycemia upon a marginal islet number, but were markedly decreased by Ad-DN-JNK. Four weeks after transplantation of islets infected with Ad-GFP, the insulin mRNA levels in the islet grafts were clearly decreased compared to those seen before transplantation, but were relatively well preserved by DN-JNK overexpression [66]. These results suggest that DN-JNK can protect β-cells from some of the toxic effects of hyperglycemia during the transplant period, providing new insight into the mechanism by which oxidative stress suppresses insulin gene transcription in β-cells. Also, the finding that this adverse outcome can be prevented by DN-JNK overexpression suggests that the β-cell JNK pathway could become a new therapeutic target for diabetes. It has been reported that β-cell destruction by

cytokines such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β) [68–70] can be prevented by inhibition of the JNK pathway [71–74], implying that JNK plays a role in the autoimmune β-cell destruction observed in early stages of type 1 diabetes. It has also been reported that levels of 8-OHdG, a marker of oxidative stress, are increased in the blood of type 2 diabetic patients as well as in the islets of type 2 diabetic animal models [8, 12, 13] and that activation of JNK by oxidative stress in islets actually reduces PDX-1 DNA binding activity and insulin gene transcription [66]. In addition, the significance of JNK in the development of diabetes has also been shown in the results of a genetic analysis in humans; while islet-brain-1 (IB1), the human and rat homolog of mouse JNK-interacting protein-1 (JIP-1) [75, 76], is known to selectively inhibit the JNK signaling [74], it was reported that a missense mutation within the IB1-encoding MAPKIP1 gene (S59N) is associated with late onset type 2 diabetes [77]. Thus, we propose that JNK is involved in the deterioration of β-cell function in both type 2 diabetes and the early stage of type 1 diabetes.

### Endoplasmic reticulum stress and insulin resistance

The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is an organelle which synthesizes various secretory and membrane proteins. These proteins are correctly folded and assembled by chaperones in the ER. Under stressful conditions such as an increase in the level of misfolded proteins, the chaperones become overloaded and the ER fails to fold and export newly synthesized proteins, leading to ER stress [78–82]. Once ER stress is provoked in the cells, various pathways are activated (Fig. 4). It has been previously reported that ER stress is involved in pancreatic β-cell apoptosis [83–87]. In Akita mice with a spontaneous mutation in the insulin 2 gene, the misfolded insulin increases ER stress, leading to decrease of β-cell mass. It has also been reported that ER overload in β-cells causes ER stress and leads to apoptosis through CHOP induction [87]. Therefore, it is likely that

ylation were increased in the liver of obese mice compared with lean controls. It is known that JNK activity is increased by ER stress (Fig. 4) [92]. Indeed, total JNK activity is also dramatically elevated in the obese mice [93]. When Fao liver cells were treated with tunicamycin or thapsigargin, both of which induce ER stress, insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) was significantly decreased. IRS-1 is a substrate for insulin receptor tyrosine kinase, and serine phosphorylation of IRS-1, particularly when mediated by JNK, reduces insulin receptor signaling. Indeed, pretreatment of Fao cells with tunicamycin produced a significant increase in serine phosphorylation of IRS-1. Tunicamycin pretreatment also suppressed insulin-induced Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 5) [93]. Furthermore, inhibition of JNK activity with the synthetic inhibitor SP600125 reversed the ER stress-induced serine phosphorylation of IRS-1. Pretreatment of Fao cells with a highly specific inhibitory peptide derived from the JNK-binding protein, JIP, also completely preserved insulin receptor signaling in cells exposed to tunicamycin. Similar results were obtained with the synthetic JNK inhibitor, SP600125. These results indicate that ER stress promotes a JNK-dependent serine phosphorylation of IRS-1, which in turn inhibits insulin receptor signaling (Fig. 5) [93].

Oxygen-regulated protein 150 (ORP150), a molecular chaperone found in the ER, has been shown to protect cells from ER stress [94, 95]. To examine the role of ER stress in insulin resistance in vivo, ORP150-expressing adenovirus (Ad-ORP) and a GFP-expressing control adenovirus (Ad-GFP) were delivered to 8-week-old C57BL/KsJ-db/db obese diabetic mice through the cervical vein. An approximately three-fold increase in ORP150 expression was seen in the liver, but not in other tissues such as muscle and adipose tissue, upon adenovirus injection. In addition, the expression levels of KDEL and Bip in Ad-ORP treated mice were lower compared to those in Ad-GFP treated db/db mice, indicating that ORP150 is acting to decrease ER stress in the liver. There was no difference in body weight and food intake between the Ad-ORP treated and the Ad-GFP treated db/db mice. When C57BL/KsJ-db/db mice were treated with Ad-ORP, their nonfasting blood glucose levels were markedly reduced, whereas no such effect was observed in the Ad-GFP treated mice. The fasting blood glucose concentrations were also significantly lower in Ad-ORP treated mice compared to Ad-GFP treated mice, although there was no difference in plasma insulin concentrations between the two groups. To examine the effects of ORP150 overexpression in the liver on insulin resistance, intraperitoneal insulin tolerance tests were performed. The hypoglycemic response to insulin was larger in the Ad-ORP treated C57BL/KsJ-db/db mice compared to the Ad-GFP treated mice. To investigate this point further, euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp tests were performed. The glucose infusion rates (GIR) of Ad-ORP treated mice were significantly higher compared to Ad-GFP treated mice, indicating that ORP150 overexpression in the liver reduces insulin resistance and thus ameliorates glucose tolerance in C57BL/KsJ-db/db mice. Endogenous hepatic glucose production (HGP) in Ad-ORP treated mice was also evaluated using tracer methods. The HGP was significantly lower in the Ad-ORP treated mice compared to the Ad-GFP treated mice. These results indicate that the reduction of insulin resistance and amelioration of glucose tolerance by Ad-ORP overexpression are mainly due to the suppression of the HGP (Fig. 5) [88].

To examine the molecular mechanism involved in the alteration of insulin action by ER stress, the phosphorylation state of IRS-1 and Akt, which are key molecules for insulin signaling, was evaluated in the liver. IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation was markedly increased in the Ad-ORP treated C57BL/KsJ-db/db mice compared to the Ad-GFP treated mice. Concomitantly, an increase in Akt serine 473 phosphorylation was observed in the Ad-ORP treated C57BL/KsJ-db/db mice compared to the Ad-GFP treated mice (Fig. 5). Expression levels of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase), key gluconeogenic enzymes regulated by insulin signaling, were markedly decreased by Ad-ORP treatment in C57BL/KsJ-db/db mice. These results indicate that reduction of ER stress enhances insulin signaling, which leads to a decrease in gluconeogenesis and an amelioration of glucose tolerance [88]. Taken together, ORP150 overexpression decreased insulin resistance and markedly improved glycemic control in diabetic model animals (Fig. 5).

**Fig. 5 Involvement of ER stress in insulin resistance**

![Diagram](attachment:diagram.png)
It has been reported that mice deficient in X-box binding protein-1 (XBP-1), a transcription factor that modulates the ER stress response, develop insulin resistance [93]. The spliced form of XBP-1 is a key factor in the regulation of ER stress via transcriptional regulation of various genes, including molecular chaperones (Fig. 4). In mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from $X B P-I^{-/-}$ mice, tunicamycin treatment resulted in increase of PERK phosphorylation. In these cells, there was also a marked activation of JNK in response to ER stress. When spliced XBP-1 expression was induced, there was a dramatic reduction in both PERK phosphorylation and JNK activation after tunicamycin treatment, indicating that $X B P-I^{-/-}$ cells are vulnerable to ER stress. Thus, it is likely that alteration of the level of spliced XBP-1 protein results in alterations in the ER stress response. Furthermore, tunicamycin-induced IRS-1 serine phosphorylation was significantly reduced in fibroblasts exogenously expressing spliced XBP-1. The extent of IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation was significantly higher in cells overexpressing spliced XBP-1. In contrast, IRS-1 serine phosphorylation was strongly induced in $X B P-I^{+/+}$ MEFs compared with $X B P-I^{+/+}$ controls even at low doses of tunicamycin treatment. Also, the amount of IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation was significantly decreased in tunicamycin treated $X B P-I^{-/-}$ cells compared with tunicamycintreated wild-type controls [93].

Since complete XBP-1 deficiency results in embryonic lethality, BALB/c-$X B P-I^{+/+}$ mice with a null mutation in one $X B P-I$ allele were used in order to investigate the role of XBP-1 in insulin resistance and diabetes in vivo [93]. $X B P-I^{+/+}$ mice fed a high fat diet developed continuous and progressive hyperinsulinemia. Blood glucose levels were also increased in the $X B P-I^{+/+}$ mice fed a high fat diet. During insulin tolerance tests, the hypoglycemic response to insulin was also significantly lower in $X B P-I^{+/+}$ mice compared with their $X B P-I^{+/+}$ littermates [93]. PERK phosphorylation was increased in the liver of obese $X B P-I^{+/+}$ mice compared with wild type controls fed a high fat diet. There was also a significant increase in JNK activity in $X B P-I^{+/+}$ mice compared with wild type controls. Serine 307 phosphorylation of IRS-1 was consistently increased in the $X B P-I^{+/+}$ mice compared with wild type controls. There was no detectable difference in any of the insulin receptor signaling components in the liver and adipose tissues of the mice of either genotype taking a regular diet. However, after treatment with the high fat diet, the major components of insulin receptor signaling in the liver, including IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation and Akt serine phosphorylation, were all decreased in the $X B P-I^{+/+}$ mice compared with the wild type controls. A similar suppression of insulin receptor signaling was also observed in the adipose tissues of the $X B P-I^{+/+}$ mice compared with the $X B P-I^{+/+}$ mice [93]. Taken together, these results show that induction of ER stress leads to a suppression of insulin receptor signaling in intact cells via IRE-1$\alpha$-dependent activation of the JNK pathway. Furthermore, deletion of an $X B P-I$ allele in mice leads to systemic insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Thus, ER stress is involved in the

progression of insulin resistance and thus could be a potential therapeutic target for diabetes (Fig. 5).

## The JNK pathway and insulin resistance

The JNK pathway is known to be activated under diabetic conditions and is possibly involved in the progression of insulin resistance. The effects of modulation of the JNK pathway in the liver on insulin resistance and glucose tolerance have been studied by Nakatani et al. [96]. Overexpression of Ad-DN-JNK in the liver of obese diabetic mice dramatically improved their insulin resistance and markedly decreased their blood glucose levels. When C57BL/KsJ-db/db mice were treated with Ad-DN-JNK, their non-fasting blood glucose levels were markedly reduced, whereas no such effect was observed in Ad-GFP treated mice. Intraperitoneal insulin tolerance tests revealed that the hypoglycemic response to insulin was larger in the Ad-DN-JNK treated C57BL/KsJ-db/db mice compared to the Ad-GFP treated mice. To further investigate this point, the euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp test was performed. The GIR in Ad-DN-JNK treated mice was higher than that in Ad-GFP treated mice, indicating that suppression of the JNK pathway in the liver reduces insulin resistance and thus ameliorates glucose tolerance in C57BL/KsJ-db/db mice. Furthermore, HGP was significantly lower in Ad-DN-JNK treated mice. In contrast, there was no difference in the glucose disappearance rate between these two groups [96]. These results indicate that reduction of insulin resistance and amelioration of glucose tolerance by DN-JNK overexpression are mainly due to suppression of hepatic glucose production (Fig. 5).

It has been reported that serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 inhibits the insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1, leading to an increase in insulin resistance [97, 98]. The level of IRS-1 serine 307 phosphorylation was markedly decreased in the Ad-DN-JNK treated mice. An increase in IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation was also observed in Ad-DN-JNK treated mice compared to the control mice. Reduction of Akt serine 473 phosphorylation was also observed in Ad-DN-JNK treated C57BL/KsJ-db/db mice [96]. Therefore, an increase in IRS-1 serine phosphorylation may be closely associated with the development of insulin resistance induced by JNK overexpression. The expression levels of PEPCK and G6Pase, key gluconeogenic enzymes regulated by insulin signaling, were markedly decreased by Ad-DN-JNK treatment in C57BL/KsJ-db/db mice. These results indicate that suppression of the JNK pathway enhances insulin signaling, which leads to a decrease in gluconeogenesis and an amelioration of glucose tolerance. Similar effects were observed in mice suffering diabetes induced by feeding a high-fat/high-sucrose diet. Conversely, expression of wild type JNK in the liver of normal mice decreased insulin sensitivity [96]. Taken together, these findings suggest that suppression of the JNK pathway in the liver exerts a beneficial effect on insulin resistance status and glucose tolerance in both genetic and dietary models of diabetes (Fig. 5).

It has also recently been reported that JNK activity is abnormally elevated in the liver, muscle and adipose tissues of obese type 2 diabetic mice and that insulin resistance is substantially reduced in mice homozygous for a targeted mutation in the JNK1 gene (JNK-KO mice) [97]. When the JNK-KO mice were placed on a high-fat/high-caloric diet, obese wild type mice developed mild hyperglycemia compared to lean wild type mice. In contrast, the blood glucose levels of the obese JNK-KO mice were significantly lower than those of the obese wild type mice. In addition, the serum insulin levels of the obese JNK-KO mice were significantly lower compared to those of the obese wild type mice. Intraperitoneal insulin tolerance tests showed that the hypoglycemic response to insulin in obese wild type mice was lower than that of obese JNK-KO mice. Also, intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests revealed a greater degree of hyperglycemia in obese wild type mice than in obese JNK-KO mice. These results indicate that the JNK-KO mice are protected from the development of dietary obesity-induced insulin resistance. Furthermore, targeted mutations in JNK were introduced into genetically obese mice (ob/ob) [97]. Blood glucose levels in the ob/ob-JNK-KO mice were lower than those in ob/ob wild type mice, and the ob/ob wild type mice displayed a severe and progressive hyperinsulinemia. Thus, JNK deficiency can provide partial resistance to obesity, hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia in both genetic and dietary models of diabetes. Taken together, obesity-induced type 2 diabetes is associated with activation of the JNK pathway, and the absence of JNK activity results in substantial protection from obesity-induced insulin resistance. These results strongly suggest that JNK plays a crucial role in the progression of insulin resistance found in type 2 diabetes. It is should be noted that there are three isoforms of JNK: JNK1, JNK2, and JNK3, and that only JNK1 has been shown to be implicated in type 2 diabetes [97]. Thus, it is likely that JNK1 is a crucial mediator of the progression of both insulin resistance and β-cell dysfunction found in type 2 diabetes. In addition, the JNK pathway is known to be activated by several factors such as oxidative stress, free fatty acids (FFAs), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), all of which are known to be increased under diabetic conditions. Under diabetic conditions, ROS are produced in various tissues and are involved in the development of insulin resistance as well as the progression of β-cell deterioration. FFAs and TNF-α are also likely to be involved in the development of insulin resistance; levels of FFAs and TNF-α are increased under obese diabetic conditions with insulin resistance, which leads to a further increase in insulin resistance. Thus, we assume that improvement of insulin resistance by suppression of the JNK pathway may at least in part counterbalance the deleterious effects of several factors such as oxidative stress, FFAs, and TNF-α (Fig. 6).

Protein transduction domains such as those of the TAT protein of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1), the VP22 protein of Herpes simplex virus, and the third α-helix of the homeodomain of Antennapedia, a Drosophila transcription factor, are known to efficiently deliver various proteins and peptides into cells through the plasma membrane, and thus there has been increasing interest in their potential usefulness for the delivery of bioactive proteins and peptides into cells [99–104]. It has recently been reported that the cell-permeable JNK inhibitory peptide (amino acid sequence GRKKRRQRRRPPRPRPRTTLLNF PQVPRSQDT) is effective for the treatment of diabetes. This peptide is derived from the JNK binding domain of the JNK-interacting protein-1 (JIP-1), also known as islet brain-1 (IB-1), and has been reported to function as a

dominant inhibitor of the JNK pathway [74]. To convert the minimal JNK-binding domain into a bioactive cell-permeable compound, a 20-amino acid sequence derived from the JNK-binding domain of JIP-1 (RPKRPTTLNLFPQVP RSQDT) was covalently linked to a 10-amino acid carrier peptide derived from the HIV-TAT sequence (GRKKRRQRRR), then to monitor peptide delivery this JIP-1-HIV-TAT peptide was further conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC). First, to examine the effectiveness of the JNK inhibitory peptide in vivo, C57BL/KsJ-db/db obese diabetic mice were intraperitoneally injected with the JIP-1-HIV-TAT-FITC peptide. The FITC-conjugated peptide showed fluorescent signals in the insulin target organs (liver, fat, muscle) and in the insulin secreting tissue (pancreatic islets). In various tissues (liver, fat, and muscle), JNK activity was also suppressed by JIP-1-HIV-TAT-FITC in a dose-dependent manner [105].

To investigate whether suppression of the JNK pathway exerts a beneficial effect on diabetes, C57BL/KsJ-db/db mice were treated with intraperitoneal injections of JIP-1-HIV-TAT-FITC or a scramble peptide as a control. There was no difference in body weight and food intake between the JIP-1-HIV-TAT-FITC treated and control mice. The non-fasting blood glucose levels in mice treated with JIP-1-HIV-TAT-FITC were significantly decreased compared with those of the untreated or the scramble peptide treated mice. Also, glucose tolerance tests showed that the glucose tolerance of the JIP-1-HIV-TAT-FITC treated mice was significantly ameliorated compared that of the untreated or the scramble peptide treated mice [105]. These data indicate that the JNK pathway is involved in the exacerbation of diabetes and that suppression of the JNK pathway may be a therapeutic target for diabetes (Fig. 7). To investigate the possible effects of the JNK inhibitory peptide on insulin action, insulin tolerance tests were performed. The reduction of blood glucose levels in response to insulin injection was much larger in the JIP-HIV-TAT-FITC treated mice compared to the untreated mice, indicating that the peptide treatment improves insulin sensitivity. In contrast, no such effect was observed when non-diabetic C57BL6 mice were treated with JIP-1-HIV-TAT-FITC. These results imply that the JNK pathway is activated under diabetic conditions and thus the JNK inhibitory peptide exerts beneficial effects on insulin action and glucose tolerance. To further investigate the effect of the peptide on insulin resistance, euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp tests were performed. The steady-state GIR in JIP-1-HIV-TAT-FITC treated mice was significantly higher than that of the untreated mice, indicating that JIP-1-HIV-TAT-FITC reduces insulin resistance in C57BL/KsJ-db/db mice. The endogenous HGP and glucose disappearance rate in the JNK inhibitory peptide treated mice were also evaluated. It should be noted that the glucose disappearance rate reflects glucose utilization in the peripheral tissues. In the JIP-1-HIV-TAT-FITC treated mice, HGP was significantly lower than in the untreated mice, and the glucose disappearance rate was significantly higher in the treated

than in the untreated mice [105]. These results indicate that JIP-1-HIV-TAT-FITC treatment reduces insulin resistance through decreasing HGP and increasing the glucose disappearance rate. These data provide strong evidence that JNK is indeed a crucial component of the biochemical pathway responsible for insulin resistance in vivo. In addition, the insulin mRNA levels and insulin content were significantly higher in the peptide treated mice. Thus, we assume that the JNK inhibitory peptide exerted some beneficial effects on the pancreatic islets. To explore the molecular mechanism of how JIP-1-HIV-TAT-FITC treatment improves insulin sensitivity and ameliorates glucose tolerance, IRS-1 serine 307 phosphorylation was evaluated in various insulin target tissues (liver, fat, and muscle) of JIP-1-HIV-TAT-FITC treated mice. IRS-1 serine 307 phosphorylation was decreased in the JIP-1-HIV-TAT-FITC treated mice compared to the control mice. An increase in IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation was observed in the peptide treated mice compared to the control mice. Concomitantly, an increase of Akt serine 473 and threonine 308 phosphorylation, both of which are known to be important for activation of the Akt pathway, was observed in the JIP-1-HIV-TAT-FITC treated mice [105]. In conclusion, the cell-permeable JNK inhibitory peptide, JIP-1-HIV-TAT-FITC, improves insulin resistance and ameliorates glucose intolerance, indicating that the JNK pathway plays a crucial role and could be a potential therapeutic target for diabetes (Fig. 7).

### Conclusions

Oxidative stress and ER stress are induced in various tissues under diabetic conditions, leading to activation of the JNK pathway. Activation of this pathway is involved in the progression of insulin resistance as well as the deterioration of pancreatic β-cell function. Indeed, suppression of the JNK pathway in obese diabetic mice markedly improves insulin resistance and β-cell function, leading to an amelioration of glucose tolerance. Taken together, these observations suggest that the JNK pathway plays a crucial role in the progression of insulin resistance as well as in β-cell dysfunction and thus could be a potential therapeutic target for diabetes.
