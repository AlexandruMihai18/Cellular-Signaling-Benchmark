### Summary
A rise in the intracellular calcium ($\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$) concentration is a major component of the signaling mechanisms regulating platelet function in thrombosis and hemostasis. Previous studies, however, failed to identify many key molecules regulating $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ signaling in platelets. Here, we review recent findings, which identified CalDAG-GEFI as a critical $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ sensor that links increases in intracellular $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ to integrin activation, TxA$_2$ formation, and granule release in stimulated platelets. Furthermore, we summarize work that lead to the discovery of STIM1 and Orai1 as key regulators of store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) in platelets. A short discussion on the usefulness of each molecule as a potential new target for antiplatelet therapy is included.

#### Keywords: calcium, CalDAG-GEFI, Orai1, platelets, signaling, STIM1.

### Introduction
Platelet activation is an integral component of hemostasis and thrombosis. Activation of platelets by most stimulatory agents leads to an increase in the concentration of cytosolic $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ [$\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_{i}$. Platelet responses that are directly dependent on an increase in [$\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_{i}$ include integrin activation, release of the second wave mediators ADP and thromboxane A$_2$ (TxA$_2$), spreading, and platelet procoagulant activity [1–4]. The source of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ for cell activation can be either intracellular or extracellular (Fig. 1). Intracellular $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ is released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) by inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP$_3$), produced by activated phospholipase C (PLC). The major mechanism for entry of extracellular $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ is store-operated $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ entry (SOCE), a process controlled by the $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ concentration in the SR. Depletion of SR $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ stores triggers the activation of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ release activated calcium (CRAC) channels in the plasma membrane [5]. In this review, we will summarize recent studies that identified molecules critical for SOCE and $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ signaling in platelets.

### CalDAG-GEFI links increases in intracellular $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ to the signaling pathways regulating integrin activation, TxA$_2$ formation, and granule release

#### CalDAG-GEFI and platelet function
CalDAG-GEFI (CD-GEFI, RasGRP2) is a member of the CalDAG-GEF/RasGRP family of intracellular signaling molecules involved in the activation of small G proteins of the Ras family [6,7]. We and others have shown that CD-GEFI is predominantly expressed in only few cell types, namely certain neurons, platelets/megakaryocytes, and neutrophils [7,8]. CD-GEFI contains binding sites for $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ and diacylglycerol (DAG) and a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) domain catalyzing the activation of Rap1 and Rap2, key regulators of integrin activation in platelets and other cells [9].

Studies by Shattil and colleagues provided the first evidence that CD-GEFI may be a critical regulator of platelet integrin activation, as αIIbβ3 activation in megakaryocytes correlated with the expression level of CD-GEFI [10]. In our own studies, we used CD-GEFI-deficient mice to demonstrate its importance for the activation of Rap1 and β3 integrins in platelets [8,11]. CD-GEFI-deficient platelets showed marked defects in αIIbβ3-mediated aggregation in response to all tested physiological agonists. The activation of β1 integrins was also significantly impaired. Mice lacking CD-GEFI were characterized by a strongly increased bleeding time and protection in models of systemic and arterial thrombosis. Furthermore, CD-GEFI$^{-/-}$ mice showed an impaired inflammatory response because of a defect in the activation of β1 and β2 integrins in neutrophils [11].

Several of our results suggest that CD-GEFI is a highly efficient sensor for $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, while it may not be regulated by changes in the intracellular DAG concentration. First, CD-GEFI$^{-/-}$ platelets show normal aggregation in response to phorbol ester (DAG mimetic) but fail to aggregate when stimulated with $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ ionophore [8]. Second, Rap1 activation in CD-GEFI$^{-/-}$ platelets is markedly delayed [12], suggesting that CD-GEFI mediates the rapid but reversible activation of Rap1, which was previously identified as a $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-dependent mechanism [13]. Third, CD-GEFI-mediated integrin activation is independent of signaling by PKC and P2Y$_{12}$/G$_{\alpha i}$ [12]. In previous studies, signaling by $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ and PKC/P2Y$_{12}$ were identified as independent yet synergistic pathways regulating the activation of αIIbβ3 [14,15] and Rap1 [16,17].

Fig. 1. Simplified model illustrating the central role of the second messenger Ca²⁺ in platelet biology. CalDAG-GEFI and Orai1/STIM1 are the main focus of this review. PLC, phospholipase C; IP₃, inositol trisphosphate; SR, sarcoplasmic reticulum; DAG, diacyl glycerol; TXA₂, thromboxane A₂; CRAC, Ca²⁺ release activated calcium channel.

In addition to the defect in integrin activation, we observed impaired granule release [8,12] and TXA₂ generation (unpublished observation) in CD-GEFI⁻/⁻ platelets. A central enzymatic step in the formation of TXA₂ is the phosphorylation of cytosolic phospholipase A₂ (cPLA₂) by (ERK) MAP kinases [18]. In platelets, both Ca²⁺ and PKC signaling have been implicated in ERK1/2 activation [19]. Our data demonstrate a strong correlation between reduced TXA₂ generation and impaired activation of ERK1/2 and Rap1 in CD-GEFI⁻/⁻ platelets. Inhibition of P2Y₁₂ signaling blocked the residual ERK activation and TXA₂ production in the mutant platelets. These data suggest that activated Rap1, regulated by Ca²⁺/CD-GEFI and ADP/Gαi signaling, controls both integrin activation and ERK-mediated TXA₂ generation. Our studies further indicate that CD-GEFI supports granule release through its role in TXA₂ generation, as we were able to restore PKC activation and dense granule release in knockout platelets by addition of thromboxane A₂ analog, U46619.

**CD-GEFI as a target for antiplatelet therapy**

Inhibition of P2Y₁₂ by inhibitors like Clopidogrel (PLAVIX) is currently one of the most powerful antithrombotic strategies used in the clinic [20]. Based on our studies, we propose that intervention with CD-GEFI signaling could prove to be an equally powerful antithrombotic approach. Targeting CD-GEFI should be safe, as its expression is limited to few cell types [7,8]. Furthermore, CD-GEFI inhibition should markedly reduce thrombotic complications because of its combined effect on several aspects of platelet function. Signaling by PKC/P2Y₁₂/Gαi, however, should allow for some hemostatic function in platelets treated with CD-GEFI inhibitors, thus reducing the risk of bleeding. The absence of spontaneous bleeding in CD-GEFI⁻/⁻ mice may confirm this hypothesis. It

tail bleeding times [26]. The four-transmembrane spanning CRAC channel moiety Orai1 (CRACM1) was identified as the SOC channel mediating STIM1-induced Ca²⁺ entry in activated platelets. Platelets from mice lacking Orai1 [27] or from mice expressing a loss-of-function mutation of Orai1 (Orai1<sup>R93W</sup>) [28] showed strongly impaired SOCE, while agonist-induced Ca²⁺ release from internal stores was normal. In both studies, impaired SOCE resulted in defective integrin activation and granule release, with the defects being most prominent in platelets activated via the collagen receptor, GPVI. Consistent with the defect in GPVI-mediated SOCE, Orai1<sup>−/−</sup> mice were protected from collagen-driven arterial and systemic thrombosis. In our own studies with Orai1<sup>R93W</sup> mice, we observed normal aggregation and adhesion to collagen under conditions of venous shear stress, suggesting that Orai1-mediated SOCE is particularly important for platelet adhesion at arterial shear rates. At static and low-shear conditions, impaired phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure was the most prominent defect observed in Orai1<sup>R93W</sup> platelets. It has long been recognized that sustained increases in \[Ca²⁺\]<sub>i</sub> are critical for the ability of platelets to switch from a pro-adhesive to a pro-coagulant, PS-positive state [29,30]. In the absence of Orai1, platelets fail to maintain elevated levels of \[Ca²⁺\]<sub>i</sub> necessary for PS exposure.

These studies demonstrate the critical role of STIM1 and Orai1 in platelet SOCE. Semi-quantitative detection of RNA and protein levels identified low-level expression for STIM2 and Orai2/3, paralogs of Orai1 and STIM1, in platelets. At present, it remains unclear if and how Orai2, Orai3, and STIM2 contribute to platelet SOCE. Members of the canonical transient receptor potential (TRPC) family, especially TRPC1, have also been implicated in the regulation of platelet SOCE. However, while studies in human platelets identified a critical role of TRPC1 in SOCE [31,32], no detectable defect in Ca²⁺ entry was observed in mouse platelets lacking TRCP1 [33].

### STIM1/Orai1 as targets for antiplatelet therapy

The studies outlined above suggest both STIM1 and Orai1 as potential new antithrombotic targets. While deficiency in STIM1 or Orai1 led to marked protection in mouse models of systemic, arterial, and ischemia-induced thrombosis, only a minor increase in tail bleeding times was observed in the mutant mice. It is to be expected that inhibition of Orai1 (and probably STIM1) will not have a major effect on hemostasis in humans, as no obvious bleeding or clotting disorder was observed in patients expressing Orai1<sup>R91W</sup>, a naturally occurring mutation equivalent to the R93W mutation introduced in Orai1<sup>R93W</sup> mice. However, these patients suffered from severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) [34], a genetic disorder in which both ‘arms’ (B cells and T cells) of the adaptive immune system are severely malfunctional. Mouse studies confirmed the central role of STIM1 and Orai1 in lymphocyte [35,36] as well as in mast-cell [37,38] function. Furthermore, STIM1/Orai1-mediated SOCE is important for endothelial-cell proliferation [39]. Thus, targeting STIM1 or Orai1 in antiplatelet

intervention may be complicated because of unwanted side effects.
