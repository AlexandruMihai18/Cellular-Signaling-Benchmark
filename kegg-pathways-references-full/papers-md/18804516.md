ABSTRACT

The use of endocrine agents is a safe and effective treatment in the management of hormone-sensitive breast cancer. Unfortunately, sooner or later, tumor cells develop resistance to endocrine manipulation making useless this approach. During the last decade, new molecules and intracellular signaling pathways involved in endocrine resistance have been identified. Several studies have documented that estrogen receptor signaling may maintain a pivotal role in the tumor growth despite the failure of a previous hormonal treatment.

In this review we will discuss the general principles for optimizing the choice of endocrine therapy based on an understanding of the molecular mechanisms responsible for resistance to the different anti-hormonal agents.

### 1. Introduction

It has long been established that estrogen is involved in the pathogenesis of breast cancer and sustains the growth of estrogen receptor (ER) expressing breast cancer cells. Consequently, therapies have been developed to reduce estrogen levels or block signaling through ER in breast cancer cells. Although introduced more than 100 years ago, endocrine therapy is still an integral component in the systemic treatment of ER-positive breast cancer at any stage. Endocrine therapy is based on different approaches, including: (i) block of ER by the use of selective ER modulators (SERMs), such as tamoxifen; (ii) reduction of estrogen levels through aromatase inhibitors (AIs); (iii) induction of ER degradation by selective estrogen receptor down-regulators (SERDs), such as fulvestrant.

For over thirty years tamoxifen has been the cornerstone for the treatment of breast cancer [1]. Five years of adjuvant tamoxifen reduce the annual risk of recurrence and death for breast cancer by 47% and 26%, respectively [2]. Moreover, tamoxifen induces objective response or disease stabilization in more than 50% of previously untreated metastatic breast cancer patients with ER-positive tumors [3]. The main problem limiting the use of tamoxifen is de novo and acquired resistance to the drug. In fact, only about half of ER-positive tumors are responsive to tamoxifen, and even initially responding tumors eventually develop resistance to the drug during the course of the treatment [4]. Several clinical trials suggest that AIs possess an enhanced anti-tumor effect as compared with tamoxifen, and might be effective in patients resistant to tamoxifen [5–7]. Recently fulvestrant has been reported to be as active as AIs in tamoxifen-resistant metastatic breast cancer patients [8] and also shows a certain efficacy in patients progressing to AIs [9]. However despite the integration of more powerful endocrine agents, resistance to all forms of endocrine therapy remains a major problem.

Much evidence has established that ER-transcriptional activity is a complex event of which estrogen binding is only a small part. The biological activity of ER is critically influenced by the cellular context, i.e. growth factor signaling pathways and availability of coregulatory proteins, along with the correct sequence of the response elements in the promoter of target genes. These factors significantly affect the efficacy of endocrine agents and are related to de novo or acquired resistance to endocrine manipulation. During hormonal treatment modifications of the cellular molecular environment can determine a switch of gene transcription from an estrogen-dependent to an estrogen-independent modality, and eventually induce transcription of estrogen-sensitive genes in the absence of ER.

A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms responsible for the loss of estrogen dependency might enable novel strategies for therapeutic intervention. This article reviews some of the known and emerging complexities of ER signaling in breast cancer and discusses the therapeutic implications of these findings.

### 2. ER: structure and function

#### 2.1. ERα and ERβ subtypes

ER belongs to a superfamily of nuclear receptors, including those of other steroid hormones, thyroid hormones, vitamin D, and retinoic acid [10]. Two molecular forms of ER have been described: ERα and ERβ. These are produced by two distinct genes located on chromosomes 6 and 14, respectively [11,12]. ERα and ERβ display a high relative tissue-specific expression, with overlapping distribution in some tissues. ERβ is more expressed in prostate, bone, ovaries (granulosa cells), lungs, and in various parts of the central and peripheral nervous system, while ERα is predominantly expressed in the pituitary gland, ovaries (thecal and interstitial cells), uterus, liver, kidneys, adrenals, and the mammary glands [13–15].

**Fig. 1.** Schematic representation of the structure of human ERα and ERβ nuclear receptors. Both ERα and ERβ are characterized by a well-defined domain organization: the A/B domain at the N-terminus contains the ligand-independent transcriptional activation function 1 (AF1), the C domain represents the DNA-binding domain (DBD) and contains a nuclear localization signal (NLS), the D domain corresponds to the hinge region, the E domain harbors the ligand-binding domain and the ligand-dependent transcriptional activation function 2 (AF2) and the F domain at the C-terminus. Numbers outside each box refer to amino-acid number. Percentage of amino-acid homology for each domain is also shown.

Normally, when bound to their ligand, the ERs function as transcriptional factors of specific target genes [16,17]. Like other steroid hormone receptors both the ER subtypes contain a well-defined domain organization, designated A/B through F [18–20] (Fig. 1). The A/B domain, which is located at the N-terminus, contains the activation function 1 (AF1) [21], a region responsible for the constitutive and ligand-independent transcriptional activity of ER. The C domain, referred to as DNA-binding domain (DBD), is responsible for specific DNA binding and receptor dimerization [22]. The D domain is a flexible hinge between the C and E domains and contains a nuclear localization signal [23]. The E domain, referred to as ligand-binding domain (LBD), is a twelve-helix region involved in ligand binding and receptor dimerization. It harbors a second nuclear localization signal and the activation function 2 (AF2), responsible for the ligand-dependent activation of ER [21]. The F domain, located at the extreme carboxy-terminus of the ERs, is a small region that although unnecessary for transcriptional activation exerts a complex modulatory role on both AF1 and AF2 activities of the receptor [24–26].

ERα and ERβ share a high degree of homology in their DBD (96%) and LBD (55%) [12]. On the other hand, the N-terminal A/B domain and the C-terminal F domain are the most variable regions. They have less than 20% amino-acid identity which indicates that these domains may contribute to ER-subtype-specific actions on target genes [27]. Compared to ERα, ERβ exhibits a weak AF1 activity [28,29] and shows a different response to agonist/antagonist ligands [25,30]. These differences suggest that ERα and ERβ could have distinct functions in terms of gene regulation and biologic response and may contribute to the selective actions of estrogen in different target tissues [31].

Both ERα and ERβ are present in normal breast tissue, but only ERα is essential for ductal growth. In fact, ERα-knockout mice show very little growth of mammary ducts [32], while ERβ-knockout mice develop a normal mammary gland with regular ductal branching [33]. It is likely that ERβ exerts pro-differentiative and anti-proliferative functions [33]. Several studies have reported an increase in ERα/ERβ ratio in breast cancer as compared with benign tumors and normal tissues [34–36], suggesting that ERα is most closely associated with carcinogenesis, while ERβ can protect against the mitogenic activity of estrogens in mammary premalignant lesions. There is evidence that the estrogen-induced proliferation of ERα-positive breast cancer cells can be inhibited by ERβ overexpression [37–39]. Indeed, ERβ has been shown to repress c-myc, cyclin D1 and cyclin A and to increase the expression of p21 and p27 causing cell-cycle arrest in G₂ phase [38] and to decrease the contents of positive proliferation regulators such as cyclin E, Cdc25A, p45SKP2 [37]. All these observations suggest that the loss of ERβ expression may be involved in tumor progression [40] and this leads to the consideration that ERβ functions as a putative tumor suppressor gene [41]. Consistent with its anti-tumor activity, the ERβ expression has been reported to be associated with a better prognosis in breast cancer patients [42].

Routinely the evaluation of the ER expression in breast cancer, as determined by immunohistochemistry, refers to ERα; consequently, the available information on the prognostic and predictive value of ER are related to this receptor form. If not otherwise specified, “ER” will refer to ERα throughout this review.

ER acts through two different mechanisms: genomic and non-genomic (Fig. 2).

### 2.2. Genomic (nuclear) ER signaling

In the absence of estrogen, ERs lie in the cell nucleus as inactive, monomeric molecules bound to heat-shock proteins [43]. Estrogen binds to the LBD of the receptor and causes a series of ER modifications, including conformational changes, phosphorylations, dissociation from the chaperon proteins and homo-, or hetero-dimerization [16]. The ER dimer binds to the consensus sequence GGTCAnnnTGACC, known as estrogen-response element (ERE), located in the promoter region of estrogen-regulated genes [44,45], and determines up-regulation of genes involved in cell proliferation

Due to its steroidal nature, estrogen is able to diffuse passively through the cytoplasmic and the nuclear membrane and to bind its nuclear receptor. The activated ER binds, as a dimer and in the presence of coactivators (CoA), to a specific DNA sequence defined as estrogen-responsive element (ERE) located in the promoter of some estrogen-regulated genes (classical pathway), such as complement 3 and pS-2. Alternatively, the activated ER binds to other transcription factors such as Fos (F) and Jun (J), that in turn bind to different DNA sequences (e.g., AP-1) and activate other estrogen-responsive genes (non-classical pathway), such as cyclin D1 and insulin-like growth factor receptor 1 (IGFR1). Estrogen can also bind to a membrane receptor that cooperates, as dimer, with growth factor receptors (GFR) and activates the signal transduction pathways of AKT and MAPK, leading to gene activation.
and survival and down-regulation of genes with anti-proliferative or pro-apoptotic activity and the final effect is of growth stimulation [46,47].

The perfectly palindromic ERE sequence derives from several highly estrogen-responsive genes from Xenopus laevis [48,49]. Whereas in human genome most estrogen-target genes have an imperfect palindromic sequences in their promoter, differing from the consensus sequence in one or more nucleotides. Different EREs induce different conformational change of the ER and therefore could constitute a mechanism for modulation of estrogen-mediated gene transcription [50].

The above described mechanism of ER action is referred to as “classical pathway” and is directly related to the ability of ER to regulate the expression of genes containing ERE sequence in their promoter, such as complement 3 and pS-2 [51].

ER can influence the transcription of genes lacking ERE sequence and regulated by other transcription factors that bind to alternative regulatory DNA sequences. This mechanism does not require a direct binding of ER to DNA given that it can be activated by ERα lacking DBD [52,53]. The promoter elements involved in this response include AP-1 sites, cyclic AMP-response elements (CREs) and Sp1 sites, which directly bind Jun/Fos [54], c-Jun/ATF-2 [55] and Sp-1 [56], respectively. ER interacts with these transcription factors, it stabilizes their direct binding to DNA and thus enhances transcription. This mechanism defined as “non-classical pathway” underlies the estrogen-induced transcription of genes such as cyclin D1 [57] and IGFR1 [58].

In some estrogen-target genes the regulation of transcription is more complex, because more than one ERE-like sequence and/or ERE half-sites are seen in the promoter [44,59]. Some genes have in their regulatory region both ERE and non-classical sites. An example is the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), whose transcription can be induced by estrogen through a variant ERE or through SP1 sites, according to the cellular context [60–63]. Interestingly some ERE half-sites can act in synergy with other regulatory elements within a gene promoter region. For example, the promoter of the PR gene contains the combination of a half ERE upstream of two Sp1 binding sites. ER could influence PR expression directly by binding to the half-site and indirectly by interacting with proteins bound to the Sp1 sites [64].

The classical and non-classical pathways are known as “genomic” or “nuclear-initiated steroid signaling (NISS)” pathways. The recruitment of estrogen-bound ER in the promoter region of sensitive genes directly via ERE or indirectly via non-classical sites is able to induce gene transcription only if AF1 and/or AF2 are activated. Depending on the cellular milieu and the specific promoter type either AF1 or AF2 can be dominant [21,65,66], but generally a synergism involving both these activation functions occurs [16,67]. It is important to note that if either AF1 or AF2 is dominant estrogen behaves as an agonist on gene transcription.

AF2 activation is totally dependent on ligand. The binding of estrogen to ER induces a rearrangement of the LBD helices 3, 5, and 12 with the creation of a hydrophobic cleft, where specifically orientated helix 12 seals inside the hormone and uncovers the AF2 region. This region serves as a binding surface for proteins containing α-helical leucine-rich peptide motifs, known as LXXLL motifs or NR boxes, which act as coactivators or corepressors of ER (collectively named as coregulatory proteins) [68–70]. The most studied coactivators are members of the p160 family of nuclear-receptor coactivators, including: nuclear-receptor coactivator 1 (NCoA1), also known as steroid receptor coactivator 1 (SRC-1); NCoA2, also known as SRC-2 or translation initiation factor 2 (TIF2); and NCoA3, also known as amplified in breast cancer 1 (AIB1) or SRC-3 [70,71]. Binding of these molecules to AF2 enhances transcriptional activity of ER by forming large complexes that recruit histone-acetyltransferase (HAT), an enzyme causing the chromatin decondensation required for gene transcription. In contrast, corepressor proteins such as nuclear-receptor corepressor 1 (NCoR1) and NCoR2 reduce ER-driven

transcription by recruitment of histone-deacetylase complexes (HDAC) at the promoter site. This leads to chromatin condensation and decreased rate of transcriptional initiation [72].

The type of coregulatory proteins recruited by ER depends on the conformational structure of the receptor which is affected not only by the nature of ligand (estrogen versus tamoxifen, see ahead) but also by the specific ERE sequence [59,73].

Diversely from AF2 activity, AF1 activity is ligand independent and was originally identified by its ability to stimulate transcription in an ERα deletion mutant that contained only the N-terminus fused to a heterologous DBD [74]. In the absence of estrogen, AF1 is activated by phosphorylation at specific serine residues (Ser<sup>104</sup>, Ser<sup>106</sup>, Ser<sup>118</sup>, Ser<sup>167</sup>) following the activation of p42/p44 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT), and p38 MAPK pathways [75–78]. These different kinase pathways are triggered by growth factor receptors (GFRs), such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) or insulin-like growth factor receptor 1 (IGFR1) [79]. AF1 phosphorylation stimulates ER-transcriptional activity by recruitment of coactivators which may be unique for AF1 or identical to those that bind AF2 [80]. The mechanism underlying the ability of estrogen to increase AF1 activity is not understood well. In response to estrogen binding ER phosphorylation is enhanced, mainly on Ser<sup>118</sup>, and to a lesser extent on Ser<sup>104</sup>/Ser<sup>106</sup> [81], the same residues involved in AF1 constitutive activity [82]. Moreover, in response to estrogen AF1 synergizes with the ligand-dependent AF2 through the recruitment of coactivators that simultaneously interact with both AFs [83–85]. Both AF1 phosphorylations and AF1–AF2 interaction contribute to the estrogen-induced ER-transcriptional activity.

The phosphorylation of ER by GFR-dependent kinases is an essential component of the ordinary regulation and function of ER. However, in the absence of estrogen ER exhibits a minimal phosphorylation status responsible for its AF1 constitutive activity. It is likely that the conformational change of ER induced by estrogen binding enhances the ability of the kinases to phosphorylate the receptor [81].

It is important to note that in particular cellular milieu, growth factor signaling pathways can directly activate ER and the transcription of ER-regulated genes in the absence of estrogen [86]. This mechanism might result in the lack of efficacy of various endocrine therapies, to be discussed in detail below.

ERα and ERβ exhibit similar patterns of gene activation at classical ERE-containing target genes even if ERβ requires higher estrogen concentrations than ERα [87]. However, ERα and ERβ have completely different effects at non-classical AP-1 sites after estrogen binding: ERα activates, while ERβ inhibits transcription [88–90]. For example, gene expression of cyclin D1 regulated by estrogen via AP-1 sites is stimulated by ERα, but it is inhibited by ERβ [91]. Therefore the relative cellular expression of ERα and ERβ will determine the final effect of estrogen on cyclin D1 expression. This suggests that ERβ may indeed modulate the proliferative effects of ERα by blocking its action on the cyclin D1 gene or other key pro-proliferative target genes containing CRE or AP-1 sites [91]. Interestingly enough, in response to estrogen ERα activation of AP-1-dependent genes requires the presence of the N-terminal domain, as demonstrated by the absence of activation in the N-terminal deletion mutant [24]. However, the ERβ chimera containing the N-terminal domain of ERα shows no activation. This suggests that there is a fundamental difference between ERα and ERβ ligand activation at AP-1 sites which involves protein–protein interactions other than or in addition to the N-terminal domain [24].

2.3. Non-genomic (membrane) ER signaling

In addition to the above nuclear effects there are ER functions that can occur very quickly in the cell (minutes from the addition of estrogen) and are initially independent of gene transcription. This rapid non-genomic mechanism of action is mediated by the membrane-associated ER and is also called membrane-initiated
steroid signaling (MISS) pathway [92]. ER localization to the membrane requires receptor palmitoylation and binding to caveolin 1 [93]. At the membrane ER is associated with caveolin rafts and upon estrogen binding interacts as dimers, directly with adaptor proteins (Shc), Src, p85 subunit of PI3K, and G-proteins [93,94], resulting in the activation of: GFRs, e.g. EGFR, IGFR1, HER2; cytoplasmic kinases, e.g. MAPKs, PI3K, AKT and the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR); signaling enzymes, e.g. adenyl cyclases [95–97]. In turn, cytoplasmic kinases can phosphorylate ER and its coregulators, resulting in the activation of nuclear ER-driven transcription [98]. All together these observations suggest that the non-genomic and genomic activities of ER are complementary and even synergistic. In addition, many proteins encoded by ER target genes, such as TGFα and amphiregulin (AR), are key components of GFRs signaling. Therefore the ER and GFR pathways establish a bidirectional functional activation leading to an amplification of the growth signal.

Non-genomic activity is highly dependent on and regulated by coregulatory proteins, and it is influenced by the overall signal transduction pathways operating in a specific cell or tumor milieu. The most studied membrane ER coregulators are: proline-glutamic acid, leucine-rich protein 1 (PELP1), also called modulator of non-genomic activity of ER (MNAR), and the metastasis-associated (MTA) proteins. MNAR/PELP1 is overexpressed in breast cancer and enhances both genomic ER activity on gene transcription and non-genomic ER activity on the c-Src/p42/44 MAPK phosphorylation cascade [96,99]. On the other hand, members of the MTA coregulators inhibit genomic activity but they enhance non-genomic action of ER. The nuclear MTA1 factor and its variant MTA1s, for example, inhibit nuclear ER activity, the former by traditional recruitment of corepressors to the ER-transcriptional complexes, the latter by sequestering ER in the cytoplasm [100,101]. In this way, MTA1s concurrently increases non-genomic ER activity [100].

Defined motifs in E domain of ER are critical for membrane localization and function of the receptor [102]. Mutations in these motifs prevent ER dimerization, association with caveolin-1, and non-genomic ER signaling activation of p42/44 MAPK, PI3K, and cAMP [103]. However, ER interaction with the signaling molecule MNAR involves both the amino (N)-terminus and portions of the E domain of ER [104].

In some tissues, such as bone and endothelial cells, estrogen signaling is predominantly non-genomic [105]. It is important to note that, for its activation, the non-genomic ER pathway is highly dependent on ligand [106].

## 3. Different therapeutic approaches to block estrogen action

### 3.1. Selective ER modulators (SERMs)

SERMs such as tamoxifen, toremifene and raloxifene, are a class of compounds endowed with estrogen agonistic and antagonistic activity in different tissues [107]. SERMs competitively inhibit binding of estrogen to ER and profoundly affect both the genomic and non-genomic activity of ER. Tamoxifen, the prototype of SERMs, binds to nuclear ER and, just like estrogen, induces its dimerization. However, unlike estrogen, the binding of tamoxifen to ER leads to a repositioning of helix 12 which causes a partial occlusion of the coactivator-binding groove [68,69], thus hampering AF2-dependent interactions with coactivators, and promotes the recruitment of corepressors [108,109]. Therefore, tamoxifen inhibits AF2 activation and blocks the transcription of genes that depend essentially on AF2 function for their expression.

The agonistic properties of SERMs depend largely on AF1 [74,107,110] and consequently SERMs act as agonists in contexts where the AF1 activity is strong [66,111]. For this reason the agonistic/antagonistic effect of tamoxifen in different tissues is largely due to the relative expression of AF1- or AF2-dependent genes. The nature of AF1 activation by tamoxifen is unclear but it may involve phosphorylations of ER and recruitment of coactivators similar to estrogen [78].

The tissue-dependent effect of tamoxifen is also related to the different cellular availability of coactivators and corepressors [112,113]. For example, tamoxifen exhibits marked agonistic activity in several endometrial cell lines where the coactivator SRC-1 is expressed at high levels. However it behaves as antagonist in mammary cells with a similar coregulator expression profile, except for low levels of SRC-1 [114]. Remarkably, mammary cells transfected with SRC-1 are stimulated by tamoxifen whereas endometrial cells silenced for SRC-1 expression loose the tamoxifen-agonistic activity [114], indicating that SRC-1 is required for tamoxifen agonism. It has been observed that SRC-1-mediated agonistic effect of tamoxifen involves genes whose promoters do not contain a classical ERE [114] and depends largely on a direct interaction of SRC-1 with AF1 [84,110]. Recently it has been reported that the AF1 agonistic activity of tamoxifen can be promoted also by a direct binding of coactivators to the AF2 region [115]. In particular, tamoxifen induces a physical and functional interaction of the coactivator PGC-1β with AF2. PGC-1β can also bind SRC-1 and the simultaneous interaction of SRC-1 with AF1 creates a molecular bridge between AF1 and AF2 responsible for AF1 activation [115]. In this way specific AF2 coactivators, such as PGC-1β, may recognize and bind the ER/tamoxifen complex thereby contributing to the agonistic properties of tamoxifen.

The agonistic/antagonistic activity of tamoxifen has been studied extensively, by transient transfection of cells with plasmids containing the estrogen-sensitive promoter region fused with a reporter gene (chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assay, luciferase assay) and measurement of the resulting enzyme activity. These experiments have shown that on ERE regulated genes, in which estrogen is agonist with both ER subtypes [116], tamoxifen has agonistic or antagonistic effect, depending on the cellular context [117]. Intriguingly, on AP-1 regulated genes in which estrogen is agonist through ER-α, but antagonist through ER-β, tamoxifen behaves largely as an agonist and independently of ER subtypes [54,88,118]. Similar observations have been made for the non-classical SP-1 pathway [56,119]. Therefore, it is not surprising that endometrial cells exhibiting very active non-classical pathway are stimulated by tamoxifen, whereas in ER-positive breast cancer cells which show a minimal active non-classical pathway tamoxifen functions as a pure antagonist [120].

In addition to the genomic effects tamoxifen also influences the non-genomic ER pathway acting as agonist [97,98]. This effect is not relevant in breast cancer cells that possess low levels of membrane ER and in which receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), such as EGFR or human epidermal growth factor-2 (HER2) are poorly expressed [218]. On the contrary, in tumor cells expressing abundant EGFR, HER2, or coregulatory proteins able to sequester ER outside the nucleus such as MTA1s and PELP1, the MISS pathway contributes more substantially to cell growth. In this milieu, the agonistic effect of tamoxifen becomes relevant and can explain the observed cellular resistance to this compound [96,98,101]. For this reason, estrogen-deprivation therapy with AIs, shutting off both the NISS and MISS activities of ER, might be more effective than tamoxifen in HER2 amplified tumors.

In summary, tamoxifen is an anti-estrogen for those cells in which the prevalent estrogen-driven gene transcription is mediated by ER AF2 activity, whereas it behaves as partial agonist when estrogen effect depend on AF1, non-classical pathway or MISS pathway.

### 3.2. Aromatase inhibitors (AIs)

Estrogen is produced, besides in the ovaries, also in extra-ovarian tissues, especially peripheral adipose tissue [121] by cytochrome p-450 aromatase (CYP19). This enzyme converts androstenedione and testosterone produced by the adrenal gland to estrone and estradiol, respectively. AIs block the aromatase enzyme and thus decrease estrogen levels. This effect is more relevant in post-menopausal
women in whom estrogen production occurs essentially by peripheral aromatization of androgens.

Two classes of AIs are currently in clinical use: steroidal, e.g. exemestane, that binds the enzyme irreversibly, and non-steroidal, e.g. anastrozole and letrozole, which block the enzyme reversibly [122]. These third-generation AIs have greater potency, specificity and reduced side effects compared with first and second-generation compounds, such as aminoglutethimide and formestane and therefore are increasingly used in the hormonal treatment of post-menopausal women with ER-positive breast cancer.

### 3.3. Selective ER down-regulators (SERDs)

Fulvestrant, the prototype of SERDs, is a 7-alkylsulphanyl analogue of 17β-estradiol and structurally distinct from SERMs [123]. The unique C7 side chain of fulvestrant is crucial for its mode of action and is responsible for its pure antagonistic activity [124]. Like estrogen and tamoxifen, fulvestrant binds the ER LBD though because of the long bulky side chains at the 7α position it induces a distinct conformational change of the pocket [125], specifically in the position of helix 12, hampering receptor dimerization and binding to DNA [126]. There is evidence that in the presence of fulvestrant, ER nuclear localization is disrupted with increased ER degradation [127]. This process involves the ubiquitin–proteasome pathway [127]. It has been reported that fulvestrant induces helix 12 of ER to interact with cytokeratins CK8/CK18, members of the nuclear matrix intermediate filament, drawing the receptor into close proximity to nuclear matrix-associated proteasomes for subsequent degradation [128]. Interestingly enough, point mutations into helix 12 and decreased levels of CK8/CK18 disrupt fulvestrant-mediated ER degradation [128] that is essential for the anti-proliferative activity of this anti-estrogen [129]. Moreover, no interaction between ERβ and either CK8 or CK18 was observed after fulvestrant treatment [128], and this may play a role in the inability of fulvestrant to degrade this ER isoform [130].

The ER down-regulation, observed in the presence of SERDs, completely inhibits ER-mediated gene transcription, inactivating both AF1 and AF2 [131].

## 4. Mechanisms of endocrine resistance

The mechanisms responsible for resistance to endocrine therapy may be common to all three classes of drugs (SERMs, AIs, SERDs) or may be specific for a particular agent (Table 1). These mechanisms can be encompassed into three main categories: (i) modifications of estrogen receptor status; (ii) alterations of the intracellular molecular milieu; (iii) anomalies in the metabolism of endocrine agents.

### 4.1. Estrogen receptor status

#### 4.1.1. Loss of expression of ERα

Obviously, any anti-estrogen therapy can be effective only in cancer cells that are dependent on ER activation to maintain their growth and proliferation. Therefore, the expression of ER is the main predictor of response to endocrine therapy and the lack of ER is the main mechanism of de novo resistance to endocrine therapy.

In a significant fraction of breast cancers, the absence of ER-gene expression has been associated with aberrant methylation of CpG islands, located in the 5′ regulatory regions of the ERα gene [132,133]. However, up to 35% of ER/PR-positive tumors also exhibit substantial ER-gene methylation, suggesting that methylation alone does not determine ER expression [134]. An alternative explanation for the loss of ER expression is represented by an increased deacetylation of histones, that results in a more compact nucleosome structure that limits transcription [133,135]. The inhibition of HDAC, the enzyme responsible for histone deacetylation, is able to restore ER expression in ER-negative human breast cancer lines without a concomitant demethylation of the CpG island in the promoter [136]. It is important that an increase in ER expression by a combination of a HDAC inhibitor and a DNA methyltransferase-1 (DNMT1) inhibitor is able to restore tamoxifen sensitivity in ER-negative breast cancer cells MDA-MB-435, both in vitro and in vivo [137]. Therefore, HDAC and DNMT1 may be potential targets for therapeutic intervention in the treatment of a subset of ER-negative breast cancers.

Generally, ER-negative breast cancers have higher expression of EGFR and HER2 compared with ER-positive tumors [138]. Evidence suggests that activation of growth factor signaling might reduce ER expression and/or function [139]. For example, in MCF-7 cells, an ER-positive human breast cancer cell line, treatment with EGF reduces ER expression by increasing signaling through EGFR, PI3K/AKT and PKC [140]. Therefore, growth factor signaling might contribute to the transcriptional repression of ER gene, resulting in endocrine resistance. However, in tumor cells expressing ER, activation of growth factor pathways can potentiate ER signaling (see below).

It has been hypothesized that loss of ER expression might be responsible for acquired resistance to tamoxifen. However, only 17–28% of tumors with acquired resistance to tamoxifen do not express ER [141,142], and approximately 20% of tamoxifen-resistant tumors will eventually respond to second-line treatment with AIs or fulvestrant [8,143]. These observations imply that patients with acquired resistance to tamoxifen might have tumors still expressing ER and therefore, a benefit from other endocrine agents. As will be described later, tamoxifen resistance mostly relies on a complex network of intracellular kinase signaling that augments its agonistic activity.

On the other hand, the loss of ER expression is the main mechanism of acquired resistance to fulvestrant. For example, MCF-7 cells becoming resistant to this drug irreversibly lose ER [144], although in an early phase the loss is reversible upon removal of the drug [145]. In the absence of ER the growth of fulvestrant-resistant cells is promoted primarily via increased EGFR/MAPK signaling [144,145]. Similarly, in tamoxifen-resistant HER2 transfected MCF-7 cells (MCF-7/HER2/neu-18), resistance to estrogen deprivation and fulvestrant is accompanied by a loss of ER and an increase of HER2 and MAPK activation [146]. In contrast, wild-type MCF-7 cells, which express low levels of HER2, become resistant to estrogen deprivation through a mechanism of receptor hypersensitivity (see below) with increased ER expression and MAPK activation [147]. These observations could be clinically relevant in breast cancer progressing on AIs: HER2-positive tumors are likely resistant to any other endocrine manipulation, including fulvestrant, because of ER loss; whereas, HER2-negative tumors might be sensitive to fulvestrant since ER pathway is still active.

Thus, ER expression in the tumor should be reassessed during the course of the disease in order to select the most appropriate therapy at each time.

Whether ER loss is due to a selection of ER-negative tumor cell clones from a heterogeneous population of cells, or to a reduced ER expression/increased ER degradation in initially ER-positive cells, is currently unknown [132,146,148,149].

4.1.2. Mutations of ERα

Mutation of ER might affect the response to anti-estrogens. For example, in tamoxifen-resistant MCF-7 xenografts, a point mutation that causes a tyrosine for aspartate substitution at amino-acid 351 (D351Y) in the ligand-binding domain of ER has been described [150]. Similarly, co-expression of wild-type ER along with an ER variant lacking exon 5 within the LBD and unable to bind estrogen, confers resistance to tamoxifen [151].

It should be considered that mutations of ER occur in less than 1% of human breast cancers [152], and therefore they are not likely to contribute significantly to the resistance to tamoxifen and more in general to SERMs. A single amino-acid substitution, changing lysine 303 to arginine, has been detected in 20 of 59 hyperplastic breast lesions [153]. This mutation produces an enhanced ER-mediated cell growth by increasing ER sensitivity to estrogen and altering the cross-talk between ER and various cellular pathways that normally down-regulate ER signaling [153]. Theoretically, such loss of regulation could contribute to the development of endocrine resistance, but no clinical evidence has been reported thus far.

4.1.3. Altered expression of ERβ

ERβ has a negative influence on ERα-promoted transcription [87] and its expression has been reported to be associated with a better prognosis in breast cancer patients [42]. In addition, ERβ expression and/or activity might be implicated in the resistance to SERMs. For example, high levels of ERβ have been observed in tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer cells [154] probably due to an increase of AP-1-dependent gene transcription triggered by ERβ in the presence of tamoxifen [88]. However, other studies reported low levels of ERβ to be predictive of tamoxifen resistance [155,156]. As seen in ERα, the loss of ERβ expression in breast cancer is frequently related to hypermethylation of CpG islands in the gene promoter [157].

Given the incongruent results, no conclusion on the role of ERβ in the mechanism of resistance to endocrine therapy can be drawn at this time. The methodology to assess ERβ and its splicing variants, patient selection criteria and the small number of patients analyzed, could explain these controversial results. Therefore, in order to verify the role of ERβ expression on endocrine responsiveness in breast cancer will likely require large-scale clinical trials.

4.2. Intracellular milieu

4.2.1. Altered expression of coregulators

It is known that coregulatory proteins can significantly influence ER-mediated transcription [70]. Moreover, since many of these may be present at rate-limiting levels in the nucleus, changes in their level of expression and/or activity can lead to alterations of ER signaling. In particular, overexpression of coactivators and/or down-regulation of corepressors can abrogate the effects of endocrine therapy, especially in the case of SERMs [110]. To this regard, a retrospective study has shown that patients with tumors overexpressing AIB1 along with HER2 and receiving adjuvant tamoxifen displayed a shorter 5-year disease-free survival, as compared to patients with tumors over-expressing only one or none of these two molecules [158]. Among patients with elevated HER2 expression, those with low AIB1 had a more favorable prognosis. Recent results extend above data by showing that AIB1 expression is a highly significant marker of relapse and death of tamoxifen-treated patients with HER3-overexpressing tumors [159]. This provides clinical evidence to suggest a cross-talk between ERα and growth factor receptor pathways through changes in expression and activity of specific coactivator proteins, such as AIB1. In fact, signaling through the HER receptor pathways activates AIB1 by phosphorylation at six different phosphorylation sites [160] and therefore, tumors with high levels of both AIB1 and HER receptors (HER2 or HER3) are less responsive to tamoxifen therapy probably because of increased estrogen agonistic activity of tamoxifen-bound ER.

Similarly, resistance is seen when cells express low levels of ER corepressors. In vitro studies have established that the corepressor NCOR1 binds ER and inhibits the partial agonistic activity of tamoxifen [161]. Importantly, low expression of NCOR1 is associated with significantly shorter relapse-free survival in tamoxifen-treated patients [162]. Therefore, evaluation of NCOR1 expression may represent an important new tool in predicting tamoxifen resistance.

4.2.2. Increased growth factor signaling

Estrogen is a positive regulator of cell-cycle and physiologically determines a negative feed-back to control cell growth by down-regulating genes involved in proliferation, such as EGFR/HER2 (Fig. 3) [163]. For this reason, anti-hormonal agents, which impede estrogen effect, unleash EGFR/HER2 expression. These RTKs are responsible for a persistent ER nuclear activity, through the activation of MAPK and AKT signaling that phosphorylates ER at Ser<sup>118</sup> and Ser<sup>167</sup> [164]. The consequent increased expression of ER-sensitive genes, in particular the EGFR ligand amphiregulin, creates a short circuit that maintains cell growth and proliferation during endocrine therapies [165]. In this way the expression of estrogen-repressed survival/proliferation genes (EGFR/HER2) becomes a factor limiting the efficacy of hormonal therapy (Fig. 3) [164]. Notably, ER activity is to be considered within a complex system of interlocking intracellular signal transduction pathways. In fact, membrane ER can activate HER2 signaling and in turn the kinase cascade downstream of HER2 can phosphorylate and activate ER and its coregulatory proteins [98], determining an amplification of the proliferative signaling. Tamoxifen stimulates this cross-talk through an agonistic effect on membrane ER that results in further activation of EGFR/HER2 pathway [97,98]. In tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer cells an increased non-genomic function of ER via cooperation with EGFR pathway has been reported [166]. This event seems to be related to a redistribution of the ER from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and plasma membrane resulting in an enhancement of its interaction with EGFR [166].

The acquired resistance to tamoxifen has been also associated with an increased transcription of estrogen-sensitive genes via AP-1 sites, presumably due to tamoxifen-liganded ER agonistic activity [167]. The p38 MAPK is a major upstream modulator of AP-1 transcriptional activity and may potentiate the agonistic effects of tamoxifen at AP-1 [118].

Fig. 3. Autocrine signaling loop limiting the anti-proliferative effect of endocrine therapy. Since estrogen-activated ER down-regulates the transcription of EGFR and HER2 genes, anti-estrogen agents determine an increase of EGFR/HER2 expression. These receptor tyrosine kinases activate the downstream MAPK/AKT cascade which, in turn, phosphorylates and activates nuclear ER, counteracting the inhibitory effect of the anti-hormonal therapy. As a consequence, the persistent ER activation leads to the transcription of ER-sensitive genes, including amphiregulin, a growth factor able to bind and activate EGFR. In this way, an autocrine proliferative loop is established.

Fig. 4. Ability of breast tumor cells overexpressing growth factor receptors (GFR) to overcome tamoxifen growth inhibition. The overexpression of GFR and the cross-talk between membrane ER and GFR are responsible for an overwhelming MISS activity of ER in the presence of tamoxifen. The subsequent increase of MAPK/AKT signaling cascade determines phosphorylation of coregulatory proteins which are responsible for the estrogen-like effect of tamoxifen in the nucleus. In this milieu, ER recruits coactivators (CoA) rather than corepressor (CoR) to the DNA-binding complex. In this phase, tumor cells are still sensitive to aromatase inhibitors (AIs) or fulvestrant (F) that are able to inhibit the established ER/ GFR cross-talk by blocking both MISS and NISS activities.

An involvement of HER2 in the de novo resistance of breast cancer cells to tamoxifen has long been hypothesized [168]. In BT474 HER2- overexpressing breast cancer cells, HER2 signaling has been shown to induce resistance to tamoxifen by inhibiting its pro-apoptotic effect [169]. The growth stimulatory effect of tamoxifen has also been observed in HER2-overexpressing MCF-7/HER2-18 cells, a valid in vitro model of de novo tamoxifen resistance [98]. In these HER2-positive breast cancer cell lines, both estrogen and tamoxifen activate the membrane ER, which in turn triggers EGFR/HER2 signaling. The EGFR/ HER2 downstream kinases, p42/44 MAPK and AKT, phosphorylate and functionally activate both nuclear ER and its coactivator AIB1 [98]. In this molecular milieu, the nuclear tamoxifen–ER complex is able to recruit coactivators rather than corepressors, resulting in enhanced expression of estrogen-regulated genes (Figs. 4 and 5A). This ability is completely reversed by the addition of gefitinib, an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor which can block signaling from EGFR/HER2 hetero- dimers, suggesting that this pathway is directly involved in the growth- promoting activity of tamoxifen in HER2-overexpressing cells [98].

Differently from tamoxifen, estrogen deprivation strikingly inhibits the growth of HER2-overexpressing MCF-7 cells (MCF-7/HER2-

Fig. 5. Overexpression of growth factor receptors (GFRs) causes endocrine resistance through different mechanisms. The energetically more convenient way the cell uses to overcome estrogen inhibition is to continue utilizing the ER machinery for gene transcription, initially, in a ligand-dependent manner, creating a molecular milieu, e.g. phosphorylations (P) and activation of coactivators (CoA), in which tamoxifen (T) acts as agonist (A), and, later, in a ligand-independent manner, making critical phosphorylations (P) that enable ER to work in the absence of ligand (estrogen or tamoxifen) (B). Sustained growth factor signaling promotes ER loss and ER-independent growth, with activation of different transcription factors (TFs), including NFkB and myc, able to maintain gene transcription for cell proliferation (C).
18). This latter evidence suggests that in patients with ER-positive, HER2 overexpressing tumors, AIs might represent a more effective therapeutic option than tamoxifen. This hypothesis is supported by results of clinical trials [170,171].

The increased EGFR/HER2 signaling is also involved in acquired resistance to tamoxifen [142,172]. In wild-type MCF-7 cells, the development of resistance to this agent is associated with increased expression of EGFR and HER2, activation of EGFR/HER2 heterodimers and phosphorylation of MAPK, AKT and nuclear ER on Ser<sup>118</sup> and Ser<sup>167</sup> [165,172,173]. In these cells tamoxifen enhances the ER-driven transcription of TGFα and amphiregulin, which in turn activate EGFR, thus sustaining an autocrine loop responsible for cell growth [172]. Recent evidence suggests a role for IGF-IR signaling in tamoxifen resistance. Thus, in tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer cells, the IGF-II plays a crucial role in regulating basal EGFR/MAPK signaling and cell proliferation [174].

In conclusion, in ER-positive cells with de novo or acquired resistance to tamoxifen, overexpression or hyperactivation of RTKs turns the normal molecular cross-talk between ER and GFRs into a vicious circle responsible for cell proliferation and involving genomic and non-genomic ER activities. For these reasons, AIs and fulvestrant, endocrine agents able to inhibit both ER activities, are still effective in patients with ER-positive, HER2-overexpressing tumors [170] (Fig. 4). Unfortunately tumors also become eventually resistant to estrogen withdrawal, since tumor cells develop the ability to use different growth factor signaling pathways which initially activate ER in the absence of estrogen (estrogen-independent, but ER-dependent cells) [144,175,176] (Fig. 5B) and finally induce estrogen-sensitive genes in an ER-independent manner (estrogen- and ER-independent cells) [140,177] (Fig. 5C). At this phase when tumors are composed predominantly, if not entirely, by ER-negative GFR-overexpressing cells, they are resistant even to SERDs. In these cells the estrogen-induced pathways become completely useless: GFRs, via MAPK and PI3-kinase signaling are able to activate different transcription factors (e.g. NFkB) [178] that induce, in an ER-independent manner, the expression of the same genes critical for cell proliferation (e.g. cyclin D1 and c-myc) [179] (Fig. 5C).

Recently it has been found that exemestane-resistant breast cancer cells express a high level of amphiregulin that is responsible for cell proliferation through the EGFR/MAPK pathway [176]. Interestingly, exposure of cells to exemestane induces amphiregulin expression in an ER-dependent manner [176].

Therefore, GFRs play central roles in resistance to various endocrine therapies, such as AIs and fulvestrant, in addition to tamoxifen [144–146].

### 4.2.3. Estrogen hypersensitivity and supersensitivity

A major mechanism by which breast cancer cells become resistant to endocrine therapy is the acquisition of an increased sensitivity to estrogen (hypersensitivity), i.e. the ability to growth in the presence of low levels of estrogen. The adaptation to estrogen withdrawal in vitro mimics the resistance to AIs in vivo [180]. To study the molecular changes associated with estrogen deprivation, a model has been developed by culturing estrogen-dependent, ER-positive MCF-7 cells in estrogen-free medium (LTED, long-term estrogen-deprivation cells) [181]. These cells grow in estrogen concentrations four-log lower than that needed by wild-type MCF-7 cells (10<sup>-13</sup> versus 10<sup>-9</sup> M) [182] and express 4 to 10-fold increased ER levels as compared to wild-type MCF-7 cells.

The ability of LTED cells to grow in the presence of very low estrogen concentrations has been attributed to an increased utilization of MISS, rather than NISS, ER pathway [182], able to rapidly trigger GFR signaling [181]. It has been reported that an up-regulation of the cross-talk between IGFR1 and ER induces the activation of MAPK and PI3K/AKT, responsible for the estrogen hypersensitivity status of LTED cells [182]. Estradiol was shown to stimulate the

adapter protein Shc, a key modulator of several RTKs, and to increase MAPK phosphorylation in a time- and dose-dependent manner [182]. Interestingly these events were blocked by fulvestrant, indicating that ER is a key upstream component of MAPK activation in LTED cells [181]. However, MAPK does not appear to be the only intracellular signaling pathway involved in the growth of LTED cells, since MAPK inhibitors are unable to fully block the estrogen hypersensitivity status [183]. On the contrary, dual-inhibition of MAPK and PI3K, with U0126 and LY294002 respectively, is able to completely reverse estrogen hypersensitivity [183].

In another LTED model, MCF-7 cells, maintained in culture medium deprived of estrogen for over 80 weeks, switched from a hypersensitive phase (cell growth stimulated by very low estrogen concentrations) to an apparent estrogen-independent phase (LTED-I) in which estrogen no longer affected their growth [184]. The exclusion of insulin from the culture medium surprisingly decreased cell growth but restored estrogen sensitiveness, suggesting that LTED-I cells were not estrogen-independent but super-sensitized to trace amounts of residual estrogen [185]. In LTED-I cells, ER-ERE transcriptional activity was 7 to 10 times higher than that of wild-type MCF-7. Although p42/p44 MAPK and PI3K in LTED-I cells were functionally active (in part due to HER2 overexpression) their specific inhibition by U0126 and LY294002 had no effect on the basal phosphorylation status of Ser<sup>118</sup> and reduced, only in part, cell proliferation and ER-transcriptional activity. In contrast, treatment of LTED-I cells with fulvestrant markedly inhibited cell growth and ER-ERE transcription, indicating that these cells were super-sensitized to residual estrogen in the medium, and that cell growth was mediated by the ER-ERE pathway [185].

It is likely that in LTED-I cells the increased ER-transcriptional activity is due not only to the phosphorylation of Ser<sup>118</sup>, but also to the phosphorylation of other sites, such as Ser<sup>167</sup> and Thr<sup>311</sup> [77]. An important role might be played by the activity of coactivators such as AIB1 [186]. In fact, increased p42/p44 MAPK phosphorylation determines the recruitment of AIB1 into the ER-transcriptional complex responsible for enhanced ER-sensitive gene transcription [186,187].

Interestingly, fulvestrant is able to inhibit the proliferation of LTED-I cells but not that of wild-type MCF-7 cells [185,188]. This evidence, translated into clinic, suggests that fulvestrant might be more effective in breast cancer become resistant to AIs than in hormone-responsive disease [185]. Moreover, since tamoxifen has no inhibitory effect on LTED cells [184], fulvestrant can be considered a more appropriate treatment following AIs resistance.

In summary, AI resistance appears to be the result of the acquired ability of the cells to become super-sensitized to very low concentrations of estrogen. This super-sensitized status is caused by an adaptive increase of ER expression and function. Moreover, the increased expression of HER2 and IGFR1 promotes activation of MAPK, ER phosphorylation and ERE transcription, suggesting the presence of a cross-talk between ER and GFRs [189].

### 4.3. Altered metabolism of endocrine agents

Most of the studies correlating metabolism of endocrine agents with response to treatment regard tamoxifen.

Tamoxifen undergoes extensive metabolism resulting in two active metabolites: 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OH tamoxifen) and 4-hydroxy-N-desmethyl tamoxifen (endoxifen). The former has been considered to play an important role in tamoxifen's anticancer effect [190] given its 100-fold greater affinity for the ER and its 30- to 100-fold greater potency in suppressing estrogen-dependent cell proliferation when compared with the parent drug [191]. However, endoxifen is more important than 4-OH tamoxifen in terms of the relative contribution to the overall anticancer activity of tamoxifen. Endoxifen has identical properties and potency compared with 4-OH tamoxifen in terms of its
binding affinity to ERs [192], suppression of estradiol-stimulated cell proliferation [193] and gene expression [192]. Furthermore, steady-state plasma endoxifen concentrations are 5- to 10-fold higher than 4-OH tamoxifen [193–195]. Even if the metabolism of tamoxifen to 4-OH tamoxifen is catalyzed by multiple enzymes, endoxifen is formed predominantly by the CYP2D6 via 4-hydroxylation of N-desmethyl tamoxifen, the most abundant tamoxifen metabolite [196]. For this reason CYP2D6 activity might be responsible for interindividual variability in response to tamoxifen.

### 4.3.1. Pharmacogenomics

Recent clinical studies have demonstrated that women carrying genetic variants associated with low or absent CYP2D6 activity have significantly lower levels of endoxifen during treatment with tamoxifen [194].

By far the most frequent null allele in Caucasians is 2D6*4, which occurs with a frequency of about 20 to 25% and is responsible for 70 to 90% of all “poor metabolizer” [197]. The key mutation is a G to A transition which causes a shift of the consensus acceptor splice site of the third intron by one base, thereby resulting in a spliced mRNA with one additional base that has an altered reading frame and a premature stop codon [197]. In Oriental populations, the frequency of the *4 allele is only around 1% or less [198].

As a consequence, patients treated with tamoxifen and carrying a homozygotic CYP2D6 *4/*4 genotype, tend to have a higher risk of disease recurrence [199]. Similar results have been observed with the CYP2D6 alleles *5, *10, *41, all variants associated with impaired enzyme function [200].

At present however, no prospective trial has been conducted to test the hypothesis that CYP2D6 genotype can predict outcome. Identifying the germline polymorphisms that predict tamoxifen response is a promising field of research but, up to date, the available results are not applicable into clinical practice.

Contrary to tamoxifen, there is little data correlating alterations in aromatase (CYP19) function and sensitivity to AIs treatment. In a retrospective study including 1975 healthy post-menopausal women, two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the aromatase gene (rs10046 and [TCT]+/−) were associated with differences in estradiol levels, but no correlations were observed with breast cancer risk [201].

It has been reported that two specific SNPs of aromatase gene, Thr<sup>364</sup> and double mutant Arg<sup>39</sup>Cys<sup>264</sup>, can affect the activity of the enzyme [202]. Moreover, the double mutant Arg<sup>39</sup>Cys<sup>264</sup> displays a significant reduced response to exemestane and letrozole compared with the wild-type enzyme [202]. However, there is no clinical evidence to date that genetic variations in CYP19 lead to resistance to aromatase inhibition.

### 4.3.2. Drug interactions

Some selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, such as paroxetine and fluoxetine, commonly prescribed to treat hot flashes in women receiving tamoxifen, are known to inhibit CYP2D6 [203]. Therefore, patients receiving paroxetine have a decreased plasma concentration of endoxifen [193] and might have no benefit from tamoxifen treatment.

In fact, a recent study reported that coprescription of CYP2D6 inhibitors, in addition to CYP2D6 genetic variation, was an independent predictor of breast cancer outcome in post-menopausal women receiving tamoxifen [204].

## 5. Optimization of endocrine therapy

Deciphering the molecular mechanisms that underlie endocrine resistance is essential for establishing the most appropriate hormone agent according to tumor characteristics and for defining the optimal sequence of endocrine therapies (Table 2). Moreover, this knowledge

is critical for development of new therapeutic approaches able to delay or reverse the hormonal resistance in breast cancer patients.

### 5.1. Sequential or concomitant use of endocrine therapy

Many breast cancer patients fail to respond to any form of endocrine therapy since the outset of treatment. As the major cause of this phenomenon is the absence of ER expression patients with ER-negative tumors should not be offered endocrine therapy [2]. On the other hand, resistance to SERMs, AIs or SERDs is likely to be mediated by distinct molecular pathways which explain the lack of cross-resistance between different classes of compounds [205,206]. Often patients whose tumor is resistant to one form of endocrine therapy may still be responsive to other types of endocrine treatment [207]. This is of primary importance for the sequential use of endocrine agents.

A common mechanism of resistance to SERMs is the activation of non-genomic ER signaling. Thus, in patients whose tumor becomes resistant to tamoxifen, second-line treatment with AIs, shutting off both the genomic and non-genomic ER activities, represents an effective therapy as evidenced by several clinical studies both in metastatic [208,209] and adjuvant setting [210–213].

Clinical experience suggests that while AIs are valid second-line agents after tamoxifen, the opposite is not true. Second-line treatment with fulvestrant (which inhibits both genomic and non-genomic effects of ER) in tamoxifen-resistant patients is at least as effective as anastrozole [8,143]. It is not yet established which treatment, AIs or fulvestrant, is more appropriate after tamoxifen failure.

The use of AIs after fulvestrant failure and the reverse sequence (fulvestrant after AIs failure) have also been investigated. Data has been presented to show that AIs still retain some activity after progression on second-line fulvestrant [214]. This observation is in contrast with pre-clinical findings which indicate that resistance to fulvestrant is associated with ER loss and estrogen independence [144,145]. It is likely that different mechanisms, rather than ER loss, may be responsible for fulvestrant resistance, although no direct evidence has been provided as yet. It has been shown that an intact NEDD8 pathway, leading to ER ubiquitination and degradation, is essential for the anti-proliferative activity of fulvestrant and that the disruption of NEDD8 pathway impairs fulvestrant's ability to degrade ER [129]. In this way, tumor cells might be resistant to fulvestrant but maintain ER expression/activity, thus being sensitive to AIs. On the other hand, the inverse sequence, i.e. the use of fulvestrant after AI failure, is strongly supported by results from both pre-clinical and clinical studies. A clinical benefit rate of about 30% has been reported using fulvestrant in patients with AI-resistant breast cancer [9]. This is consistent with the hypothesis that LTEE cells, an in vitro model of AI resistance, are hyper- or super-sensitized to very low estrogen concentrations, and that adaptation to estrogen withdrawal is dependent on ER signaling [181,185]. In these cells ligand-independent activation of ER by growth factor signaling is, at least in part, responsible for resistance to estrogen deprivation.

As above discussed, amplification of growth factor signaling pathways is also involved in the resistance to SERMs, suggesting that fulvestrant is a more appropriate alternative to tamoxifen

following the onset of AI resistance [184]. In patients with metastatic breast cancer who had progressed after treatment with non-steroidal AIs, the steroidal AI exemestane showed some anti-tumor activity, thus suggesting a lack of cross-resistance between exemestane and non-steroidal AIs [215]. A recent published randomized clinical trial concluded that exemestane and fulvestrant are equally active after failure of non-steroidal AIs [216].

Classical anticancer drugs are often used in combination in order to increase cell kill by targeting different mechanisms simultaneously. However, the experience of combining hormonal agents, i.e. tamoxifen with anastrozole, has been discouraging [217]. Although not completely understood yet, the explanation of these negative results may rely on the estrogen agonistic properties of tamoxifen, which become dominant at low estrogen concentrations, preventing the full estrogen-deprivation effect of AIs. Moreover, concomitant administration of anastrozole or letrozole with tamoxifen was found to decrease the plasma levels of these AIs by 30–40% and by 20–30% respectively, whereas tamoxifen plasma levels were unaffected [218,219]. Therefore, the currently available clinical [217], experimental [220] and pharmacokinetic [218,219] data do not support the general use of concomitant tamoxifen and AIs.

Pre-clinical data has shown that fulvestrant is an effective inhibitor of LTED cell growth and that estradiol at concentration >10⁻¹⁰ M antagonizes this inhibitory effect [185]. Therefore, fulvestrant may be more effective in patients who have plasma and/or intratumoral levels of estrogen below physiological concentrations. On this basis several clinical trials are currently investigating the use of fulvestrant in combination with AIs in breast cancer therapy either following prior non-steroidal AI treatment or as first-line therapy. In particular, the study of Faslodex versus Exemestane with/without Arimidex (SoFEA trial) randomizes women with ER-positive, locally advanced/metastatic breast cancer failing non-steroidal AIs to receive fulvestrant alone, exemestane alone or the combination of fulvestrant with anastrozole. Another study, the SWOG 226, compares the efficacy of a combination of fulvestrant plus anastrozole with anastrozole alone in the first-line setting.

An intratumoral aromatase model in rodents, constituted by MCF-7 cells engineered to express aromatase and inoculated into ovariectomized athymic mice, has been developed in order to evaluate the activity of the association of fulvestrant and AI [221]. It has been shown that the acquired resistance to anastrozole or fulvestrant was reversed by combining the two agents rather than switching the treatments [221]. In this model, the administration of anastrozole plus fulvestrant from the beginning or in sequence was associated with a down-regulation of signaling proteins involved in hormonal resistance (IGFRIβ, MAPK, AKT, mTOR, and ERα) compared with tumors treated with a single agent [221]. These results suggest the possibility to reverse or delay the development of resistance to AIs by blocking simultaneously ER and aromatase enzyme in breast cancer patients.

### 5.2. Predictive factors of endocrine response

Since the introduction of SERMs, the hormonal therapy of breast cancer has been progressing rapidly with the advent of drugs such as AIs and SERDs. The prediction of individual response to these hormonal agents is critical for an appropriate management of patients. Although the presence of ER in breast cancer tissues is the strongest predictor of response to all forms of endocrine therapy many patients with ER-positive tumors do not respond to this type of treatment. For this group of patients, HER2, PR and other less known molecules have been proposed as predictive factors of endocrine sensitivity.

#### 5.2.1. HER2 status

Pre-clinical data supports the hypothesis that SERMs may be less effective when growth factor signaling pathways are active [98]. In fact, the activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling cascade via the HER family of receptors, activates other cell survival pathways that protect breast cancer cells from tamoxifen-induced apoptosis [77]. Moreover, HER2 overexpression results in increased MISS ER activity, a pathway in which tamoxifen acts as agonist [209,222]. Both phenomena are completely reversed by specific EGFR/HER2 inhibitors, indicating the presence of an active cross-talk between ER and the growth factor signaling pathways [98]. These evidences are consistent with several clinical studies showing that patients with tumors overexpressing HER2 may derive less benefit from adjuvant tamoxifen than those with HER2-negative tumors [223,224]. However, other trials have come to different conclusions [225,226]. The reason of these incongruent results is probably related to a diverse percentage of patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy in the different studies. It is likely that the use of chemotherapy may obscure the interaction between HER2 and tamoxifen.

HER2 overexpression has been also investigated as predictive factor of AI sensitivity. Experimental studies have shown that human breast cancer xenografts overexpressing HER2, which exhibits a de novo resistance to tamoxifen are completely inhibited by estrogen withdrawal [98]. Consistent with this finding is the observation that, in the neoadjuvant setting tumors overexpressing HER2 show higher response rates to AIs as compared to that obtained with tamoxifen [170,227]. The major benefit from AIs over tamoxifen in short-term treatment (neoadjuvant setting) may not necessarily translate into a long-term better outcome (adjuvant setting). In fact, in two recent adjuvant studies HER2 status failed to identify patients with differential relative benefit from AI over tamoxifen [228,229]. Interestingly, the proliferation marker Ki67, determined before and after neoadjuvant treatment with either AI or tamoxifen, is not significantly reduced by these endocrine therapies in HER2-positive tumors compared with those HER2-negative. This data suggests that HER2 overexpressing tumor cells, despite an initial better response to neoadjuvant AI, are able to use survival pathways alternative to ER and can quickly develop an estrogen-independent proliferation, i.e. hormonal resistance to both AI and tamoxifen [230].

In the metastatic setting, a meta-analysis of 12 different studies involving more than 2000 patients concluded that, as compared to HER2-negative, HER2-positive tumors are less responsive to any type of endocrine treatment. However, the study was not designed to verify if AIs are better than tamoxifen in patients with HER2-positive tumors [231].

The overall message coming out from pre-clinical and clinical studies is that patients with HER2-positive tumors may show resistance to tamoxifen and may be more sensitive to AIs, at least in an initial phase.

Finally, HER2 status has been also evaluated as predictive factor of response to fulvestrant. In a recent prospective analysis it has been shown that the efficacy of fulvestrant in metastatic breast cancer patients does not depend on HER2 status [232]. This might be caused by the unique mechanism of action of this agent, able to block nuclear and membrane-bound ER and consequently the above-mentioned cross-talk between ER pathway and growth factor pathways, responsible for the escape from anti-hormone control [232].

##### 5.2.2. PR status

In patients with metastatic breast cancer, PR expression may predict response to tamoxifen [233,234]. Increased benefit from tamoxifen has also been observed in the adjuvant setting, in patients with PR-positive breast cancer [235]. Moreover, in a large retrospective meta-analysis including women with early breast cancer treated with tamoxifen patients with ER-positive/PR-positive tumors showed a significantly lower relative risk of recurrence and death as compared with those with ER-positive/PR-negative tumors [236]. In this study ER and PR levels in tumor samples were measured in two different central laboratories using identical standardized quality controlled methodology in order to guarantee the accuracy of

hormonal receptor determination. The Oxford overview does not show a relationship between PR levels and tamoxifen benefit [2]. However, the latter study also failed to show the predictive value of ER in earlier analyses raising questions about the quality of receptor assay.

Interestingly, pre-clinical and clinical evidences suggest that the absence of PR in ER-positive breast cancer may reflect growth factor signaling activation [237,238] rather than a non-functional ER signaling pathway. In breast cancer cells it has been shown that short-term treatment (hours) with IGF-1, EGF and heregulin reduces PR expression at transcriptional level, as a result of PI3K/AKT pathway activation [238–240]. Growth factor signaling stimulates ligand-independent activation of ER and shifts ER activity from the classical NISS to a predominantly MISS or non-classical NISS, resulting in the loss of tamoxifen antagonistic effect [171]. In PR-negative tumors the block of growth factor signaling with targeted agents recovers SERM sensitivity [98,241], indicating that PR-negative phenotype reflects activation of growth factor pathways. Tumors with high MISS ER activity are still highly dependent on estrogen and therefore may be sensitive to estrogen withdrawal therapy [171]. Consistently, the ATAC trial showed that AIs could be superior to tamoxifen in tumors expressing ER but not PR [7], supporting the results of other reports [171,233]. However, this observation has not been confirmed by other studies [242]. Moreover, when ER/PR status of tumor samples from the ATAC trial was centrally reviewed, a greater benefit of anastrozole for ER-positive/PR-negative patients was not evidenced [229]. Finally, in the extended adjuvant MA.17 trial the major benefit from letrozole was observed in patients with ER-positive/PR-positive tumors compared to those with ER-positive/PR-negative tumors [243,244]. However, the authors recommended caution for clinical decision-making based on these results because the data referred to is a subset analysis and hormonal receptors were not measured centrally [243].

Importantly, PR status has been also evaluated as predictive factor of response to fulvestrant. In a recent prospective analysis, PR negativity does not significantly influence response rate and time to disease progression in metastatic breast cancer patients treated with fulvestrant [232].

Whether loss of expression of PR can predict a poor clinical outcome of endocrine therapy remains controversial and needs to be further investigated. Recently, it has been suggested that PR expression measured by RT-PCR might be a useful prognostic factor in breast cancer [245].

### 5.2.3. New potential predictive markers

In addition to HER2 and PR, there are other molecules studied as predictive factors of endocrine response in breast cancer. These include: VEGF, VEGF receptor (VEGFR), p53, tissue inhibitor metalloproteinase-3 (TIMP3), cyclin D1, p-21-activated kinase 1 (PAK1), urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) and plasminogen activator inhibitors (PAI-I) [246–252]. Unfortunately, controversial results have been obtained and thus far none of the newly proposed predictive factors can be transferred to the clinical practice.

Results from non-randomized trials of adjuvant tamoxifen revealed that decreased VEGF expression is predictive of better outcome [248,253,254]. On the contrary, VEGF expression showed no predictive value in patients randomized to two-year adjuvant tamoxifen versus no treatment, while expression of VEGFR2 correlated with poor response to tamoxifen [249].

In a retrospective study involving 73 patients with metastatic breast cancer treated with endocrine therapy at the first relapse, p53 cell accumulation predicted resistance to endocrine therapy [250]. However, other studies failed to show any predictive role of p53 status in either metastatic or adjuvant setting [225,226,255].

Another interesting molecule is TIMP-3. This is a unique member of the metalloproteinase system that is able to inhibit metalloproteinases [256] and to induce cell apoptosis [257]. In breast cancer patients high tumor levels of TIMP-3 have been reported to correlate with the success of adjuvant tamoxifen [247]. This is probably due to the ability of tamoxifen to reduce bcl-2 thus increasing TIMP-3-induced apoptosis [247].

Cyclin D1 is a critical regulator of the cell-cycle promoting G1-S phase transition after binding to cyclin-dependent kinases (cdk) 4 and cdk6 [258]. In addition to its original role cyclin D1 also affects the activity of various transcription factors in a cdk-independent manner, including ER [259]. In this respect cyclin D1 interacts with ER and allows recruitment of coactivators to the receptor in the absence of estrogen [259]. Cyclin D1 overexpression has been associated with improved breast cancer survival [260]. This beneficial effect has been correlated with cyclin D1's ability to repress the anti-apoptotic transcription factor, STAT3. However, two clinical studies have found a strong link between cyclin D1 overexpression and resistance to tamoxifen [261,262]. Recent data suggests that in the presence of tamoxifen cyclin D1 binds preferentially to ER rather than to STAT3, increasing cell survival and proliferation [252].

Interestingly, the same chromosomal region of the cyclin D1 gene (11q13) contains PAK1, a gene coding for a protein involved in several cellular processes, including cytoskeleton reorganization and promotion of cell survival. Its amplification, reported in about 15% of breast cancer, has been associated with decreased benefit from adjuvant tamoxifen [251].

The components of the urokinase system, uPA and PAI-1, are well established prognostic factors in breast cancer [263] and have also been studied as predictors of tamoxifen efficacy [2046]. In patients with recurrent breast cancer increased levels of uPA and PAI-1 have been shown to correlate with a higher probability of tamoxifen failure [246].

Overall, data on new potential predictive factors of endocrine response is controversial and does not allow a definitive conclusion. Several methodological problems could explain these conflicting results, including heterogeneity of the tumor cell population, different sampling (primary tumor versus metastatic, biopsy versus surgical specimen, primary tumor versus post-treatment biopsy), different detection methods (amplification versus expression, biochemical versus immunohistochemical assay) and different cut-off values.

In the last few years the use of microarrays for gene profiling has provided a refined molecular classification of human breast cancer [264]. Gene expression studies have consistently confirmed the heterogeneity of breast cancer, providing new insights into the mechanisms of resistance to endocrine therapy. A microarray approach was used to identify DNA methylation markers in a population of 278 ER-positive, node-negative breast cancer patients treated with tamoxifen. The combination of tumor grade, tumor size, ER expression levels and DNA methylation identified a subgroup of patients with excellent outcome after tamoxifen treatment (DFS 95% at 10 years versus 62% in the poor prognosis group) [265].

Current research efforts are directed at the discovery of specific gene profiles, referred to as “molecular signatures” that could, identify patients likely to respond to endocrine therapy.

Using paraffin-embedded tumor samples from node-negative ER-positive breast cancer patients a recurrence-score (Oncotype DX™) has been identified and validated by the evaluation of 21 genes through RT-PCR [266]. Oncotype DX™ seems to accurately identify a group of patients with excellent prognosis when treated with adjuvant tamoxifen. Additionally, a simple two-gene expression ratio between the Homeobox B13 gene (HOXB13) and the Interleukin 17B receptor (IL17BR) has been evaluated in patients with ER-positive breast cancer at risk for tumor recurrence after adjuvant tamoxifen. In particular a high HOXB13/IL17BR expression ratio was found to be predictive of disease recurrence in a multivariate analysis [267]. Another gene expression profile has been developed to predict response to tamoxifen in patients with metastatic disease [268]. This signature, based on the differential expression of 81 genes in the
primary tumor, was able to discriminate between tamoxifen-responsive and -resistant tumors [268].

The use of in vitro cell-based large-scale genetic screens aimed at evaluating gain- or loss-of-function of specific genes, has also yielded insights into the mechanisms of tamoxifen resistance. This approach, which allows the establishment of functional relationships between genotype and occurrence of endocrine resistance, provides an indication on the relevant genes to be clinically validated. For example, a gain-of-function approach utilizing retroviral cDNA libraries, has demonstrated that fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 17 overexpression causes tamoxifen resistance in vitro [269]. This prompted to investigate the FGF pathway (FGF17 and the receptors FGFR1–4) for the response to tamoxifen in patients with recurrent breast cancer [270]. In these patients, high mRNA FGFR4 expression was predictive of poor response to tamoxifen and shorter progression-free survival [270]. Similarly, using a loss-of-function approach (iRNA screen), CDK10 has been identified as a modifier of tamoxifen sensitivity [271]. In fact, CDK10 silencing increased ETS2-driven transcription of c-RAF, resulting in MAPK pathway activation and loss of tumor cell reliance upon estrogen signaling. Patients with tumors expressing low levels of CDK10 relapse early on tamoxifen [271].

The high-throughput techniques have raised great hope for a better understanding of tumor biology and the mechanisms underlying resistance to endocrine therapy but, at the moment, the lack of reproducibility in different centers is a large limitation to their clinical application. However, it is likely in the near future that the standardization of the procedures will allow to identify key molecules involved in endocrine resistance of breast cancer and to predict response to a specific anti-hormonal agent. This knowledge will help in the choice of individualized treatment and will be the bases for the development of new molecularly targeted agents.

## 6. Overcoming endocrine resistance by signal transduction inhibitors (STIs)

As discussed above, during endocrine therapy the up-regulation of growth factor signaling is the most important adaptative molecular change that occurs in breast cancer cells and which eventually determines endocrine resistance [165,241,272,273]. For this reason, the combination of anti-hormonal agents with different growth factor signaling inhibitors (e.g. anti-HER2, anti-EGFR or anti-Ras signaling) may be effective in preventing endocrine resistance and restoring responsiveness [273–275].

Several studies have used STIs to prevent the onset of resistance during hormonal treatment. In ER-positive human breast cancer cells, tamoxifen or AIs synergize with farnesyl transferase inhibitors (FTIs) in inhibiting cell growth and enhancing cell death [276]. In an in vitro study gefitinib in combination with tamoxifen or fulvestrant promotes an anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effect higher than that achieved with either drug alone [164]. In particular, the two-agent combination was able to prevent the activation of EGFR/p42/44 MAPK signaling and significantly delayed the development of tamoxifen resistance [164].

STIs might also have a role in the treatment of hormone-resistant breast cancer. In HER2-overexpressing MCF-7 cells (MCF-7/HER2-18), treatment with gefitinib eliminates tamoxifen-agonistic activity and restores its anti-tumor effect, both in vitro and in vivo [98]. Likewise, the enhanced ER-mediated gene transcription observed in LTED cells can be abrogated by agents able to interrupt upstream signaling, including gefitinib and the MAPK-inhibitor UO126 [185]. Another important pathway involved in hormone-resistant breast cancer is PI3K/AKT pathway [277]. In response to different growth factors (EGF, VEGF, IGF-1, heregulin) PI3K activates AKT, which promotes cell survival through phosphorylation of substrates involved in the apoptotic machinery, such as Bad and caspase 9 [277]. The PI3K/AKT signaling pathway also regulates the G1/S transition of cell-cycle by activating mTOR, that regulates p70S6 kinase and 4E-binding protein-1 [278,279]. This cell survival pathway can be abrogated by the specific PI3K inhibitor LY294002, and by mTOR inhibitors, such as temsirolimus (CCI-779) or everolimus (RAD-001) [278]. The relevance of a PI3K/AKT pathway in the hormone-resistant phenotype is emphasized by the evidence that MCF-7 cells, transfected to produce a constitutively active AKT, proliferate under reduced estrogen concentrations and are resistant to the growth inhibitory effects of tamoxifen [278]. Treatment of these cells with temsirolimus restores sensitivity to tamoxifen, that suggests that AKT-induced tamoxifen resistance may be mediated by signaling through mTOR pathway [278]. Recently, the dual EGFR/HER2 inhibitor lapatinib has been shown to cooperate with tamoxifen in determining a more rapid and profound cell-cycle arrest than that observed when either agent alone in hormone-resistant cells is used [280]. When used in combination the two drugs caused a greater reduction of cyclin D1, an increase of p27 kinase inhibitor and a greater inhibition of cyclin E-cdk2 [208], all of which are molecular changes associated with cell growth inhibition.

Finally, data from two different HER2-overexpressing ER-positive breast cancer xenograft models (MCF-7/HER2-18 and BT474 cells) indicates that tamoxifen or estrogen deprivation is more active in the presence of a complete blockade of all HER dimer pairs, achieved by combining pertuzumab, trastuzumab, and gefitinib, rather than in the presence of a single HER inhibitor [281]. This suggests that tumor cells can escape the block of a single HER dimer pathway using an alternative HER signaling and therefore, the best anti-tumor effect of endocrine therapy might be reached if it is used in combination with a HER-inhibitor “cocktail” [281].

The above pre-clinical findings provided a strong rationale for the development of clinical trials in which endocrine therapy is combined with STIs in patients with ER-positive breast cancer. These trials, most of which are ongoing, use combinations of inhibitors of HER2, EGFR, farnesyl transferase, mTOR, with either tamoxifen, AIs or fulvestrant [275]. Even if metabolic drug–drug interaction might be a concern in these studies, thus far no clinically relevant pharmacokinetic alteration has been reported. For example, co-administration of lapatinib and letrozole might potentially alter the metabolism of either drug, since lapatinib inhibits CYP3A4 and letrozole is a substrate of this enzyme. However, a recent phase I study on lapatinib plus letrozole indicates that the combination of these two drugs is safe, does not result in a pharmacokinetic interaction, and has clinical activity [282]. A careful selection of patients, along with sequential tumor biopsies during therapy will help to identify the most relevant molecular target associated with endocrine sensitivity and resistance.

## 7. Conclusions

In ER-positive breast cancer cell growth and proliferation is largely maintained by active transcription of estrogen-sensitive genes. Therefore, therapies blocking ER signaling are widely used to inhibit the transcription of these genes and to disrupt breast cancer growth. The idea that estrogen binding to ER, by itself, can entirely mediate estrogen-target gene transcription is an oversimplification. In fact, recent progress in understanding ER biology and function has revealed a complex signaling interaction between ER and other signal transduction pathways, mainly triggered by EGFR, HER2 and IGFR. In addition, ER function is critically influenced by the expression and activity of coregulatory proteins.

The resistance to all forms of endocrine therapy remains a major problem in the management of hormone-sensitive breast tumors. Distinct molecular mechanisms seem to be involved in the therapeutic failure of SERMs, AIs or SERDs, consistent with the reported lack of cross-resistance among different anti-hormones [205,206,214,215]. The main cause of primary endocrine resistance is the absence of ER expression and therefore, patients with ER-negative tumors should
not be offered any form of endocrine therapy. Other molecular mechanisms by which breast cancer cells can escape hormonal control include: mutations of ER, altered expression of ERβ, alterations in the expression/activity of coactivators/corepressors, hyperactivity of GF signaling pathways, modifications in the metabolism of endocrine agents, and, finally, loss of ER expression.

Up-regulation of GFRs is responsible for resistance to various endocrine approaches [144–146] in different ways, depending on the agent, the time of exposure, and the constitutive molecular characteristics of tumor cells. In the presence of GFR hyperactivity there is a time-dependent molecular adaptation of cells to the long-lasting impaired estrogen signaling. Initially, GFR signaling increases ER activity and through its bidirectional cross-talk with ER creates a molecular milieu (phosphorylations of ER and its coactivators) in which tamoxifen acts as an agonist. Later, sustained growth factor signaling activity leads to critical phosphorylations on ER that induce transcription of estrogen-sensitive genes in a ligand-independent manner. Finally, GFR signaling is able to activate estrogen-sensitive genes in ER-independent manner and this is associated with ER loss. At this final phase tumors become resistant even to SERDs (Fig. 5).

The knowledge of the specific molecular mechanisms of resistance to each endocrine agent is crucial for defining the optimal timing and sequence of their administration. Literature data described herein suggests that a reasonable modality of using the available endocrine agents could be to start with tamoxifen, particularly if the tumor does not express molecules reflecting an hyperactivation of growth factor signaling, i.e. absence of HER2 and presence of PR. On the contrary, patients with tumors overexpressing HER2 or lacking PR might achieve more benefit from AI treatment. After tamoxifen failure, we propose to use AI and reserve fulvestrant as the last endocrine treatment.

Importantly, the molecular characterization of the complex signaling networks operating in endocrine resistant cells, e.g. EGFR, HER2, MAPK, AKT, mTOR, will enable the development of pharmaceutical compounds targeted at the various components of these pathways in order to overcome or delay the onset of resistance to endocrine therapy in breast cancer [273–275]. Based on pre-clinical data, clinical trials are ongoing to evaluate the activity of endocrine agents in association with STIs. The hope is that novel targeted therapies might maximize the benefit of hormonal treatment and delay the use of chemotherapy in patients with metastatic breast cancer.

Unfortunately, current knowledge is insufficient to identify groups of patients who will derive benefit from the different endocrine agents, and there is a pressing need for new molecular and clinical data to improve understanding in this area. In the future, molecular profiling of individual tumors will help to predict the most appropriate endocrine therapy for each patient.
