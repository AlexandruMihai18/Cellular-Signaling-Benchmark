Many pathogenic bacteria use cell–cell signaling to regulate the expression of factors contributing to virulence. Bacteria produce signals of diverse structural classes. The signal molecule known as diffusible signal factor (DSF) is a cis-unsaturated fatty acid that was first described in the plant pathogen Xanthomonas campestris. Recent work has shown that structurally related molecules produced by the unrelated bacteria Burkholderia cenocepacia and Pseudomonas aeruginosa regulate virulence, biofilm formation and antibiotic tolerance in these important human pathogens. Furthermore, DSF family signals have been shown to be involved in inter-species signaling that modulates bacterial behavior. An understanding of these diverse signaling mechanisms could suggest strategies for interference, with consequences for disease control.

The discovery of DSF in Xanthomonas campestris

The discovery of DSF arose from a molecular genetic analysis to identify factors responsible for the regulation of the synthesis of extracellular degradative enzymes and extracellular polysaccharide (EPS) virulence factors in the plant pathogen Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris (Xcc) [1–4]. These studies identified a cluster of genes termed *rpf* (regulation of pathogenicity factors), mutation of which leads to coordinate downregulation of the synthesis of the extracellular enzymes endoglucanase and protease, the EPS xanthan, and reduced virulence to plants [1–4]. The involvement of products of several of these *rpf* genes in a signaling system was revealed by complementation studies. The phenotype of *rpfF* mutants could be restored to wild type either by growth adjacent to strains that were wild type for *rpfF* or by components extracted from the supernatants of these strains with organic solvents. The factor responsible for these effects was termed DSF, for diffusible signal factor [1–4]. Further analyses revealed that DSF synthesis is completely dependent on RpfF, which has amino acid sequence relatedness to enoyl CoA hydratase and is partially dependent on RpfB, a long-chain fatty acyl CoA ligase. The two-component signal transduction system comprising the sensor RpfC and regulator RpfG, which also controls the synthesis of extracellular enzymes and of extracellular polysaccharide virulence factors, is implicated in DSF sensing and signal transduction; strains lacking RpfC or RpfG do not respond to addition of exogenous DSF [3]. These proteins are encoded by the *rpfGHC* operon, which is adjacent to *rpfF* and convergently transcribed. RpfC positively regulates the synthesis of virulence factors, but negatively regulates DSF synthesis. The elevated level of DSF in *rpfC* mutants allowed characterization of the signal as the unsaturated fatty acid cis-11-methyl-dodecenoic acid (11-Me-C₁₂:2; Figure 1), representing the paradigm for a novel structural class of signal [5].

Comparative genomic studies have revealed that the *rpf* gene cluster, with some variation, is found throughout the xanthomonads but not in other bacteria [6–9]. The conservation of *rpfF*, *rpfG*, and *rpfC* genes indicates the conservation of a DSF-mediated signaling system. DSF synthesis has now been detected by bioassay in other Xanthomonas spp., in the plant pathogen Xylella fastidiosa, and in Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, some strains of which are opportunistic human pathogens [10–12]. Furthermore, mutation of *rpfF* has been shown to negatively influence the virulence of a number of these bacteria. One exception is *X. fastidiosa*, where DSF-deficient mutants show enhanced virulence but reduced capacity to colonize the insect vector [12,13].

Although DSF synthesis was thought to be restricted to the xanthomonads, new findings indicate a much broader significance of DSF signaling in the bacterial world. Structurally related molecules are produced by the unrelated bacteria Burkholderia cenocepacia and Pseudomonas aeruginosa [14–16]. Furthermore, signaling involving these DSF family members contributes to bacterial virulence, biofilm formation, and antibiotic tolerance in these important human pathogens [7,16,17]. In addition, DSF family signals have been implicated in interspecies and interkingdom signaling, where they can modulate the behavior of other microorganisms that do not produce the signal [17].

Here we review these recent insights into the broad significance of DSF family signaling systems in bacteria. We begin with a discussion of the newly-identified DSF family signals and the role of RpfF in signal synthesis. We then discuss the diversification of signal perception and transduction mechanisms for DSF family signals in different bacteria. We follow this with an overview of the role of DSF family signals in interspecies communication that influence bacterial behavior and in interkingdom signaling with eukaryotes. We conclude by identifying

![Structure of DSF family and related signal molecules](image)

Figure 1. The structure of DSF family and related signal molecules from a range of bacteria. The DSF family signals (shown on the left) have the key cis-unsaturated double bond at the 2 position, but differ in the presence of branches, the presence of a second cis double bond, and in chain length [5]. A newly proposed nomenclature for these molecules is given. Molecules on the right are related structures; 3-hydroxypalmitic acid methyl ester is a signal molecule from *Ralstonia solanacearum* that controls the synthesis of virulence factors in this plant pathogen [42]; farnesolic acid is a signal molecule from *Candida albicans* that influences the yeast-hyphal transition but is not active in DSF bioassays [43]; trans-decenoic acid (SDSF) produced by *Streptococcus mutans* acts as an interkingdom signal to inhibit the yeast-hyphal transition in *C. albicans* [39]; 12-methyl tetradecanoic acid has been tentatively identified as the DSF in *Xylella fastidiosa* [21], but does not have the signature cis-unsaturated double bond at the 2 position.

some outstanding research questions concerning this fascinating family of signal molecules and their roles in plant and animal pathogenic bacteria.

### Defining the DSF family in bacteria

As outlined above, DSF from Xcc has been characterized as cis-11-methyl-dodecenoic acid (Figure 1) [5]. The cis-unsaturated double bond at the 2-position is a key structural feature for activity. This motif is regarded as the signature for DSF family signals. Furthermore, it is believed that the methyl branch plays a role—for example, the unbranched cis-2-dodecenoic acid and cis-2-tridecenoic acid are between 60- and 120-fold less active than DSF. There also appears to be chain-length dependence—unbranched cis-unsaturated fatty acids with chains longer or shorter than 12 or 13 carbons have very little or no activity in the DSF bioassay.

Evidence that cell-cell communication involving DSF family signals is not restricted to the xanthomonads has come from identification of cis-2-dodecenoic acid (*Burkholderia* DSF, or BDSF; C<sub>12</sub>:Δ<sup>2</sup>) in the culture supernatant of the human pathogen *B. cenocepacia*, and from the characterization of a factor responsible for biofilm dispersal in *P. aeruginosa* as cis-2-decenoic acid C<sub>10</sub>:Δ<sup>2</sup> (Figure 1) [14,15]. A homolog of RpfF (BCAM0581) is responsible for the synthesis of the BDSF signal. The synthase for cis-2-decenoic acid in *P. aeruginosa* however remains to be identified [15]. Mutation of the gene encoding BCAM0581 leads to reduced virulence-factor production and reduced virulence of *B. cenocepacia* in insect, zebrafish and mouse models [7,16,18]. Addition of exogenous BDSF can restore the synthesis of virulence factors and virulence to wild type [18]. The trans isomer of 2-dodecenoic acid, by contrast, has little or no activity [18]. It is noteworthy that cell-cell signals of other chemical classes (N-acyl homoserine lactones and quinolones) have already been described for both *P. aeruginosa* and *B. cenocepacia* [19,20].

Although the examples given above appear to suggest that different bacteria produce distinct DSF family molecules, recent findings indicate that this is not the case. In the xanthomonad *S. maltophilia*, RpfF is involved in the synthesis of DSF and seven structurally-related saturated and unsaturated fatty acids: 2-tridecenoic acid, 10-methyl-dodecanoic acid, 11-methyl-dodecanoic acid, 12-methyl-2-tridecenoic acid, 2-tetradecenoic acid, 12-methyl-2-tetradecenoic acid, and 13-methyl-2-tetradecenoic acid [11]. These components were not isolated, however, and their relative signaling efficacies could therefore not be assessed. The fatty acid 12-methyl-tetradecanoic acid (Figure 1) was characterized in *X. fastidiosa* culture supernatants, and was tentatively associated with the DSF activity of this plant pathogen [21]. In the light of the work outlined above, and the structural requirements for DSF signaling in Xcc, the possibility arises that this saturated fatty acid is one of a suite of molecules produced by RpfF in *X. fastidiosa*, and that the majority of DSF activity resides in a less abundant cis-unsaturated fatty acid that has so far escaped detection.

Multiple DSF family signals have recently been detected in bacteria within the *Burkholderia cepacia* complex (Bcc) and in *Xanthomonas* spp. The Bcc bacteria *Burkholderia lata*, *B. cenocepacia*, *B. vietnamiensis*, *B. dolosa*, and *B. ambifaria* produce BDSF (cis-2-dodecenoic), whereas *B. multivorans*, *B. stabilis*, *B. anthina*, and *B. pyrrocinia* also synthesize cis,cis-11-methyldodeca-2,5-dienoic acid, a new member of the family of DSF-like signal molecules (Figure 1) [16]. *B. multivorans* also produces a DSF (cis-11-methyl-2-dodecenoic acid). Cis,cis-11-methyldodeca-2,5-dienoic acid was equally as effective as DSF in restoring EPS production to the *rpfF* mutant of Xcc and in

Review

Box 1. Bioassay for the DSF family of cell–cell signal

The bioassay most widely used for DSF signals depends upon the restoration of synthesis of endoglucanase to an *rpfF* mutant of Xcc by compounds extracted from culture supernatants with organic solvents. In the original assay the level of endoglucanase enzyme activity was measured [1]. In a development of this assay, expression of the *engXCA* gene (which encodes the endoglucanase) is measured using a reporter plasmid in which the *engXCA* promoter drives expression of *gusA*, which encodes beta-glucuronidase, or *gfp*, which encodes the green fluorescent protein. Other bioassays depend upon the ability of DSF signals to cause dispersal of aggregates of the *rpfF* mutant when the bacteria are grown in L medium, or the ability of an organism producing DSF to induce protease production in an *rpfF* mutant when the two strains are grown in proximity on skimmed-milk agar plates [3]. The evident diversity of DSF family signals and the structural requirements for DSF perception by Xcc indicate that further bioassays are required to detect the full spectrum of molecules. For example, *cis*-2-decenoic, which causes biofilm dispersal in *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*, is not effectively recognized by the Xcc bioassay. A number of laboratories have developed systems for quantitative and qualitative assessment of DSF signals using C18 reverse-phase columns with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) in tandem with mass spectroscopy [5]. This depends upon culturing and collecting bacterial supernatant and extracting with an equal volume of ethyl acetate. The organic phase is usually evaporated, and the residue is dissolved in methanol. The crude extract is subjected to flash column chromatography using a silica gel column eluted with ethyl acetate–hexane (4:96 v/v). The collected active component is then applied to HPLC on a C18 reverse-phase column and eluted with methanol–water. A modification of this method was recently reported that included elution with water–methanol and formic acid that was believed to improve extraction efficiency [22].

causing dispersal of the aggregates of the *rpfF* mutant that form during growth in specific media [14,16] (Box 1). Analysis of culture supernatants of *Xanthomonas oryzae* pv. *oryzae* (Xoo), a rice pathogen, has revealed the presence of DSF, BDSF and *cis*,*cis*-11-methyldodeca-2,5-dienoic acid (termed CDSF in this report) [22]. These three signals, which depend on RpfF for their synthesis, were present in different ratios depending on the culture medium and were produced with different time-courses during growth. CDSF was not as effective as DSF or BDSF in restoring EPS and production of the extracellular enzyme xylanase to the *rpfF* mutant of Xoo. The utilization of the improved extraction technique used for Xoo also allowed detection of BDSF and CDSF (in addition to DSF) in culture supernatants of Xcc [22].

The biological relevance of production of multiple DSF family signals by one organism is unclear. It is possible that this is related to fine control of intraspecies signaling or to interspecies signaling with a range of other bacteria. For example, although *P. aeruginosa* does not synthesize DSF or BDSF, it is capable of sensing these molecules, with consequences for bacterial behavior (see below). Swapping RpfF homologs between bacteria in the Bcc complex indicates that the pattern of signals produced is regulated principally by the supply of different substrates and not by differences in the specificities of different RpfF synthases [14,17]. This conclusion is also supported by the observation that Xoo exhibits different patterns of signal production under different growth conditions [22]. Although RpfF has some amino acid sequence similarity to enoyl CoA hydratase, the substrates for RpfF and the

Box 2. Outstanding questions and research aims

- Identifying the substrates and enzymatic mechanism of the RpfF DSF synthase: are there other synthases for different DSF family signals?
- Identifying sensing mechanisms of DSF family signals by RpfC and different sensor kinases in other bacteria: do other sensory mechanisms exist?
- Establishing signal transduction pathways to include identification of the immediate signaling partners for sensor kinases.
- Investigating interactions of DSF family signals with fungi and higher eukaryotes including plants and animals.

mechanism of action of the enzyme are as yet unknown, and these remain major questions to be addressed in this field (Box 2).

Distinct classes of sensor kinases are involved in DSF perception

The sensing and transduction of DSF family signals in bacteria involve sensor kinases located in the cytoplasmic membrane and associated cytoplasmic regulators. The best studied of these sensory systems is RpfC–RpfG of Xcc, which is found in all xanthomonads. RpfC is a complex sensor kinase comprising a sensory input domain, a histidine kinase (HisKA) domain, a CheY-like two-component receiver (REC) domain, and a C-terminal histidine phosphotransfer (HPT) domain (Figure 2) [3,23–25]. RpfG comprises a REC domain and an HD-GYP domain, which is a phosphodiesterase involved in degradation of the second messenger cyclic di-GMP. Bioinformatic analysis predicts that the sensory input domain of RpfC comprises five transmembrane helices with periplasmic and cytoplasmic loops of less than 20 amino acids. The residues responsible for DSF binding are not known. Binding of the signal is believed to activate autophosphorylation of RpfC within the histidine-kinase domain, followed by phosphorelay involving an aspartic acid residue within the REC domain and a histidine residue within the HPT domain, and finally phosphotransfer to the REC domain of the RpfG regulator. Phosphorylation of RpfG leads to its activation as a cyclic di-GMP phosphodiesterase. The phosphorylation of RpfG and consequent alterations in the level of cyclic di-GMP in the cell affect the synthesis of virulence factors, including extracellular enzymes, EPS, biofilm dispersal and motility, by diverse mechanisms that we will discuss below [3,23–25].

Although conserved amino acid residues of RpfC implicated in phosphorelay are essential for the production of extracellular enzymes and EPS, they are not required for a second role of RpfC: the repression of DSF biosynthesis [26]. The available evidence suggests that this latter effect is mediated instead by protein–protein interactions between the REC domain of RpfC and RpfF, the DSF synthase [27]. Sequestration of RpfF in this manner could restrict DSF synthesis [26]. Release of RpfF as a result of conformation changes in RpfC taking place upon DSF binding could act as a mechanism to allow rapid autoinduction of DSF synthesis. RpfC thus has a dual signaling function – with phosphorelay controlling synthesis of extracellular enzymes and EPS, and protein–protein interactions controlling DSF synthesis. This latter mechanism represents an added dimension to conventional two-component signaling paradigms. However it remains to be seen

whether such interactions can be detected in Xcc expressing wild-type levels of the proteins.

The very recent identification of sensor kinases for DSF family signals in *B. cenocepacia* and *P. aeruginosa* indicates diversification of signal transduction pathways associated with perception of DSF-like molecules in different bacteria [17]. In *B. cenocepacia*, the sensor kinase BCAM 0227 has been implicated in the perception of BDSF [18]. BCAM 0227 is a complex sensor comprising sensory input, HisKA, REC, and HPT domains, as with RpfC. However, unlike RpfC, the sensory input domain of BCAM 0227 is predicted to have two transmembrane helices and a large periplasmic loop of 300 amino acids (Figure 2). The precise mechanism by which this sensor recognizes BDSF remains to be determined. BCAM 0227 does not regulate expression of BCAM 0581, which encodes BDSF synthase, and mutation of BCAM 0227 does not alter BDSF levels. Although nothing is known of the BDSF signal transduction mechanism beyond BCAM 0227, this could involve BCAM 0228, which encodes, instead of an RpfG-like regulator, an OmpR-like two-component response regulator with a DNA-binding domain [18].

Additional diversity in sensing systems for DSF family signals is evident from identification of PA1396, a sensor for DSF and BDSF in *P. aeruginosa* [25]. Although *P. aeruginosa* does not produce these signals, it can recognize them during interspecies signaling to influence traits such as biofilm formation and polymyxin tolerance [17, 28]. The sensor kinase has an input domain with an amino acid sequence related to that of the sensory-input domain of RpfC, together with HisKA and REC domains, but differs from RpfC in that it lacks a C-terminal HPT domain (Figure 2). Little is currently known about the immediate signaling partners for PA1396. The absence of a C-terminal HPT domain in PA1396 suggests the involvement of one of several 'stand alone' HPT domain proteins of *P. aeruginosa* in signal transduction that could also involve PA1397, a response regulator containing a CheY-like receiver domain and a helix-turn-helix (HTH) DNA-binding domain.

PA1396 does not appear to be involved in sensing cis-2-decenoic acid, the DSF family signal produced by *P. aeruginosa* (Figure 1), indicating the presence of multiple sensing systems recognizing different DSF family members in the same organism. A current hypothesis is that the sensor PA1396 allows detection of interspecies signals whereas the sensor for the *P. aeruginosa* DSF (cis-2-decenoic acid) signal remains to be identified. Distinct DSF perception pathways have also been proposed in other organisms. In *X. fastidiosa*, addition of DSF has a positive effect on the regulation of genes involved in adhesion in both *rpfF* and double *rpfCrpfF* mutant strains [12, 13]. This suggests that there is likely to be a second pathway for DSF perception which does not involve RpfC. This second pathway could involve an alternative sensor kinase, although the possibility that DSF might act as a coregulator within the bacterial cell, perhaps after conversion to a CoA derivative, cannot be overlooked.

Figure 3. Multiple signal transduction pathways lead to expression of different DSF-regulated functions in Xcc. Perception of DSF leads to autophosphorylation and phosphotransfer to the REC domain of RpfG (shown by the red arrow). This leads to activation of RpfG as a cyclic di-GMP phosphodiesterase, an activity associated with the HD-GYP domain. The consequent reduction of cyclic di-GMP levels promotes synthesis of extracellular enzymes and EPS but leads to inhibition of biofilm formation. DSF signaling also promotes RpfG binding to two proteins with a GGDEF diguanylate cyclase domain. This physical interaction, indicated by the dashed arrow, acts to control motility, but has no influence on biosynthesis of extracellular enzymes and EPS or on biofilm formation. Cyclic di-GMP effects on the synthesis of extracellular enzymes and EPS involve the transcriptional activator Clp. Cyclic di-GMP binds to Clp, thus preventing binding of Clp to the promoters of target genes that include those encoding extracellular enzymes and EPS biosynthesis. The reduction in cyclic di-GMP levels as a consequence of DSF perception (indicated by the line with a crossbar) relieves this inhibition, thus allowing Clp to bind to DNA and activate gene expression. The negative regulation of biofilm formation by the Rpf/DSF system is exerted independently of Clp, and could in part involve control of expression of the xagABC gene cluster which encodes putative glycosyl transferases required for biofilm formation. DSF negatively influences expression of the xagABC gene cluster, an effect that requires the two-component RpfC-RpfG system. We speculate that in the absence of DSF (i.e. conditions in which biofilm formation occurs) the high intracellular levels of cyclic di-GMP positively influence the expression of xagABC (and other functions) required for biofilm formation.

DSF signaling and the regulation of bacterial virulence, biofilm formation and antibiotic resistance

Signaling mediated by DSF family molecules contributes to a range of bacterial functions including virulence, biofilm formation, motility, interaction with insect vectors and antibiotic tolerance. In addition to observations of alterations in bacterial phenotype, transcriptomic and/or proteomic approaches have been used to identify the scope of regulation by DSF family signals within Xcc, X. fastidiosa and B. cenocepacia [13,17,18,29]. It is evident that DSF signaling influences the expression of genes or proteins involved in a wide range of cell functions including multi-drug resistance, general stress tolerance, the synthesis of extracellular enzymes, motility, chemotaxis, adhesion synthesis, the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, iron uptake, and the synthesis of EPS. Comparative proteomic studies have also revealed the extent of the regulatory influence of DSF as an interspecies signal. Addition of DSF to P. aeruginosa leads to an increase in the relative abundance of a number of proteins implicated in virulence and stress tolerance, and of others contributing to tolerance to polymyxins [17]. Reverse transcription (RT)-PCR studies indicate that many of these regulatory effects of DSF in P. aeruginosa are exerted at the level of gene transcription [17].

The signal transduction pathways leading to regulation of these diverse functions are best understood in Xcc (Figure 3). As outlined above, in Xcc the perception of DSF by RpfC is linked to phosphorylation of the HD-GYP domain regulator RpfG and alteration in the intra-cellular levels of the second messenger cyclic di-GMP [17,28]. Different pathways then act to control different subset of Rpf-regulated virulence functions. The physical interaction of RpfG with two proteins with a diguanylate cyclase (GGDEF) domain acts to control motility, but does not influence extracellular enzyme synthesis or biofilm formation [25]. These protein-protein interactions require the conserved GYP motif in the HD-GYP domain of RpfG and are dependent on DSF signaling.

The effect of RpfG on extracellular enzyme synthesis and biofilm formation could be exerted through influences of cyclic di-GMP on the cAMP receptor-like protein Clp [29-32]. Binding of cyclic di-GMP to this transcriptional activator occurs at physiologically relevant levels of the nucleotide and results in inhibition of Clp binding to the promoter of the engXCA gene which encodes the major endoglucanase (Figure 1). A reduction in cyclic di-GMP levels as a result of DSF perception, and activation of RpfG as a phosphodiesterase, are thought to relieve this inhibition, thereby allowing Clp to activate engXCA transcription. DSF also positively controls the expression of the clp gene, suggesting additional regulatory complexity. Clp regulates many functions in the DSF ‘regulon’ in addition

to the expression of genes encoding extracellular enzymes, but is not apparently involved in regulating biofilm dynamics. These findings could indicate the existence of further cyclic di-GMP-mediated pathways that influence this multicellular behavior (Figure 3). A notable step towards defining one such pathway was provided by recent observations that a putative glucosyl transferase gene cluster is essential for the formation of biofilms and that expression of this gene cluster is negatively regulated by DSF through the RpfC-RpfG two-component system [33].

In summary, DSF signaling in Xcc controls diverse functions by divergent signaling pathways, of which some molecular details are now known. By contrast, our understanding of the mechanisms underpinning DSF family signal transduction in B. cenocepacia and P. aeruginosa remains fragmentary.

### The role that the DSF family of signal molecules plays in interspecies signaling

In nature, bacteria are more likely to grow in polymicrobial communities than in monoculture [34,35]. The development and maintenance of such communities depend upon interactions between the members that can involve interspecies signaling [36,37]. In addition to signal exchange between partners that utilize identical or related signal molecules, bacteria can also modulate their behavior in response to cell-cell signals that they do not synthesize, thereby ‘eavesdropping’ on the communication of other organisms [36]. Bacterial signal molecules have also been implicated in interkingdom signaling governing prokaryote-eukaryote interactions [36]. DSF family molecules and other structural classes have been implicated in both interspecies and interkingdom communication [38] (Figure 4). The production of DSF and/or BDSF by xanthomonads and members of the Bcc complex indicates the potential for interspecies signaling between these bacteria which can occur together in a number of environmental niches, including in association with plants. More intriguing is the interaction of P. aeruginosa with B. cenocepacia and S. maltophilia. These three organisms are found together in a number of environmental niches that include associations with plants and with infections of the cystic fibrosis lung. Unlike B. cenocepacia and S. maltophilia,

P. aeruginosa does not produce DSF (*cis*-11-methyl-2-decenoic acid) or BDSF (*cis*-2-dodecenoic acid), but responds to these exogenous signals by modulating biofilm formation and polymyxin tolerance [17]. Coinfection could thus have an impact on the efficacy of polymyxins, which are being reintroduced into clinical practice as agents for treatment of *P. aeruginosa* infections. This response requires the sensor kinase PA1396. Conversely, *P. aeruginosa* synthesizes *cis*-2-decenoic, which acts as an intraspecies signal but is not apparently sensed by *B. cenocepacia* or *S. maltophilia*.

Bioinformatic analysis reveals significant amino acid sequence similarity between the input domain of RpfC (and PA1396) and the N-terminal regions of histidine kinases from a number of other bacteria that are not established producers of DSF family signals. These bacteria include *Pseudomonas syringae* pathovars tomato and *phaseolicola* (each of which has two such proteins), *Pseudomonas fluorescens*, *Pseudomonas entomophila*, *Enterobacter sp.* 638, *Paracoccus denitrificans* and *Thiobacillus denitrificans*. The distribution of these organisms in the environment suggests that they could cohabit certain niches with DSF-producing organisms, such as in epiphytic or endophytic association with plants, in the rhizosphere, or in soil environments. This indicates that DSF-mediated interspecies signaling could be widespread.

The DSF family of signal molecules has also been implicated in interkingdom signaling between bacteria and the dimorphic fungal pathogen *Candida albicans* (Figure 4). DSF, BDSF and CDSF modulate the morphological yeast-hyphal transition of *C. albicans*. BDSF is the most potent inhibitor of *C. albicans* germ-tube formation, followed by CDSF and DSF [14,22,33]. Diverse compounds are able to inhibit the *Candida* yeast-hyphal transition. In addition to the fungal signals farnesol and farnesoic acid, dodecanol, the bacterial quorum sensing signal 3-oxo-C12-homoserine lactone, and *trans*-2-decenoic acid produced by *Streptococcus mutans*, all have activity, although these compounds are less effective than BDSF [39]. It is not known if all these molecules exert their action through the same mechanism. Nevertheless it is evident that the overall process does not have the same structural stringency as bacterial sensing of the DSF family signals. The designation of *trans*-2-decenoic acid produced by *S. mutans* as SDSF, based on this *Candida* assay, is thus slightly misleading because this molecule does not have the key structural *cis* configuration of DSF family members.

### Concluding remarks and future directions

Here we have described the current state of knowledge of bacterial signaling involving signals of the DSF family, extending from the original observations in a plant pathogen to now encompass a wide range of bacteria including animal and human pathogens. It is evident that there are a number of outstanding questions concerning the molecular details of synthesis, perception and transduction of signals of the DSF family in these diverse bacteria (Box 2). Several of these bacteria also produce signal molecules of other structural classes. The regulatory interplay between these signaling systems and DSF signaling is however poorly understood. As we have seen, signals of the DSF family can

**Figure 4. Signals of the DSF family play a role in interspecies and inter-kingdom signaling. Molecules of the DSF family produced by *Stenotrophomonas maltophilia* and *Burkholderia cenocepacia* influence the behavior of *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* and the yeast-hyphal transition in *Candida albicans*. Other signal molecules, including *N*-acyl homoserine lactones (*N*-AHL) such as 3-oxo-dodecanoyl-homoserine lactone (oxo-C12-HSL), are produced by *P. aeruginosa* and influence *C. albicans* and *B. cenocepacia*. DSF family signals could also have a role in interspecies communication between *S. maltophilia* and *B. cenocepacia*.

Review

Box 3. Translating knowledge of DSF signaling into disease control measures

Experiments in the plant pathogens X. fastidiosa and Xcc have led to the conclusion that DSF cell–cell signaling occurs *in planta*, but that an optimal concentration of DSF is required for virulence. This fine balance of DSF synthesis might therefore be readily disrupted by either degradation or overproduction of the signal, with consequences for disease control. Accordingly, inoculation of bacteria able to degrade DSF or of bacteria able to synthesize DSF (including an *rpfC* mutant of *X. fastidiosa*) can reduce virulence and symptom production by *X. fastidiosa* in grape. Strains that can degrade DSF can also reduce the severity of disease symptoms caused by Xcc in brassicas [13]. An extension of this approach is to engineer plants to express RpfF and hence elevate DSF levels.

Rapid degradation or inactivation of DSF by a *Pseudomonas* sp. strain G requires *carAB*, which encode enzymes responsible for the synthesis of carbamoylphosphate, a precursor in biosynthesis of pyrimidines and arginine [13]. The mechanisms by which bacteria degrade or inactivate DSF are unknown, although the requirement for CarAB has suggested an involvement of UDP-sugars. It should be possible to select or engineer strains with enhanced CarAB activity for use as biocontrol agents for plant diseases caused by Xcc, *X. fastidiosa* and other xanthomonads.

To influence disease in animals or humans, a rational approach would be to identify molecules that block key signal sensing or transduction steps. Such molecules could represent lead compounds for new drugs. This approach has been successful in enterohemorrhagic *Escherichia coli* (EHEC) and *Salmonella Typhi- murium* [40,41].

influence morphological transitions in the dimorphic fungus *C. albicans*. Whether these signals could also affect other fungi and higher eukaryotes, such as the hosts of plant and animal pathogens, remains to be determined. Interference with DSF signaling could afford a route to the control of bacterial disease in plants and animals (Box 3), and some encouraging steps have been made towards translating our knowledge of this fascinating family of signal molecules into practical disease-control measures.
