anhydrotetracycline

This is one of a group of enzymes involved in one of the terminal steps in the biosynthesis of the tetracycline group of antibiotics. It is found in various strains of *Streptomyces aureofaciens* and *S. rimosus*, including a wide variety of mutants in which antibiotic production is blocked. Dedimethylamino-4-amino-anhydrotetracycline and a monomethylated intermediate, dedimethylamino-4-methylaminoanhydrotetracycline, can be detected in reaction mixtures, particularly when S-adenosylmethionine is made limiting.¹ It is assumed that a single enzyme introduces both methyl groups, but supporting evidence is lacking. The N-methyltransferase activity has been studied only in crude cell-free extracts.

## Assay Method

### Principle
The presence of N-methyltransferase activity in crude cell extracts can be determined by measuring incorporation of label from \[^{14}C\]S-adenosylmethionine into the product by the reaction, anhydrotetracycline. The anhydrotetracycline can be readily separated from residual \[^{14}C\]S-adenosylmethionine by extracting it into o-chlorophenol after precipitation of proteins with perchloric acid. Unless O₂ is excluded

from the reaction mixture, other enzymes present in crude extracts will convert the \[^{14}C\]anhydrotetracycline to \[^{14}C\]tetracycline. However, the synthesis of \[^{14}C\]tetracycline does not interfere with the determination of N-methyltransferase activity, since the o-chlorophenol will extract any \[^{14}C\]tetracycline formed.

**Reagents**

- Tris·HCl buffer, 0.2 M, pH 7.0
- \[^{14}CH_3\]S-Adenosylmethionine 0.5 mM
- Dedimethylamino-4-aminoanhydrotetracycline, 0.25 mM in methanol
- Perchloric acid, 3.5%
- Phosphate buffer, 0.1 M, containing 0.1% of the disodium salt of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid.

**Procedure.** A reaction mixture is prepared by combining 0.1 ml of the 0.25 mM solution of the substrate, dedimethylamino-4-aminoanhydrotetracycline, 0.1 ml of the \[^{14}CH_3\]S-adenosylmethionine, 0.3 ml of distilled water, and 0.5 ml of a 20 mg/ml solution of the lyophilized extract in 0.2 M Tris buffer. The reaction mixture is incubated at \(28^\circ\) for 2 hr. Proteins are removed by addition of 0.2 ml of 3.5% perchloric acid, and the soluble fraction is then extracted with 0.5 ml of o-chlorophenol. The o-chlorophenol is extracted two times with water and then evaporated to dryness. The dry residue is dissolved in methanol to facilitate transfer to a paper chromatogram or to a vial prepared for liquid scintillation counting. Any standard liquid scintillator is suitable. The radioactivity in the extract is related directly to the extent of transfer of methyl groups from S-adenosylmethionine to dedimethylamino-4-aminoanhydrotetracycline. The identity of the labeled product can be established by paper chromatography using the system described in the section on preparation of dedimethylamino-4-aminoanhydrotetracycline.

**Preparation of Dedimethylamino-4-aminoanhydrotetracycline.** The substrate for the N-methyltransferase can be isolated from cultures of Streptomyces rimosus NRRL 3098. A vegetative inoculum of *S.* rimosus is prepared in a medium containing in grams per liter: corn steep liquor, 20.0; sucrose, 30.0; \((NH_4)_2SO_4\), 2.0; and CaCO₃, 7.0. Fifty milliliters of this medium in a 250-ml Erlenmeyer flask are sterilized, inoculated with spores of NRRL 3098 and then placed in a reciprocating shaker operating at 110 strokes per minute at \(28^\circ\) for 32 hr. Two milliliters of this vegetative inoculum are used to inoculate 25 ml of the following medium contained in a 250-ml Erlenmeyer flask: (in g/liter); KCl, 1.23; H₃PO₄ (85%), 0.24; NH₄Cl, 1.50; \((NH_4)_2SO_4\), 8.0; CaCO₃, 10.0; starch, 55.0; MgCl₂·6H₂O, 2.0; FeSO₄·7H₂O, 0.06; MnSO₄·4H₂O, 0.05; CoCl₂·6H₂O,

0.005; L-histidine, 0.10; and lard oil, 20.0. The inoculated flask is incubated at 180 rpm on a rotary shaker at \(28^\circ\) for 48 hr, at which time 2.0 mg of L-ethionine are added. The fermentation is continued for an additional 48 hr and then harvested. An ethyl acetate extract of the whole fermentation broth is prepared by mixing equal volumes of broth, ethyl acetate, and 1.4% perchloric acid. The organic phase is separated from the mixture and applied to Whatman No. 1 paper strips previously buffered with \(0.1 \, M \, \mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{HPO}_{4}\) containing \(0.1\%\) of the disodium salt of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and dried. The strips are developed with *n*-butanol saturated with water for 12 hr. Three orange fluorescent zones are visible under ultraviolet illumination. The dedimethylamino-4-aminoanhydrotetracycline is present at an \(R_{f}\) of 0.12. A slower moving component, dedimethylamino-4-methylaminoanhydrotetracycline is found at \(R_{f} \, 0.24\) and dedimethylamino-6-demethyl-4-aminoanhydrotetracycline at \(R_{f} \, 0.05\). The desired component at \(R_{f} \, 0.12\) is eluted from the paper strip with methanol. The yield from 25 ml of fermentation broth is about 10 mg. Methods for the preparation of gram quantities of dedimethylamino-4-aminoanhydrotetracycline have been described.²

Preparation of the Crude Extract. Streptomyces aureofaciens ATCC 13,192 is grown in a corn steep liquor, sucrose, \((\mathrm{NH}_{4})_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4}, \mathrm{CaCO}_{3}\) medium under conditions identical to those described above. The mycelial growth is separated from the medium by slow speed centrifugation and washed in sufficient distilled water to permit pouring of the mycelial suspension into the cell of a Raytheon 10 kc sonic oscillator. After a 2-min sonic treatment, a soluble fraction is obtained by centrifugation at 40,000 *g* for 30 min. Lyophilization of this soluble fraction provides a powder that retains its activity for months if stored at \(-10^\circ\). The temperature in all of the above operations is not permitted to exceed \(4^\circ\).

### Properties

#### Stability
The lyophilized cell extract is stable for months if stored at \(-10^\circ\).

#### Substrate Specificity
The enzyme methylates the following dedimethylamino-4-aminoanhydrotetracycline derivatives: the 7-chloro-, 6-demethyl-, 2-decarboxamido-2-nitrile-, and 4-methylamino-.

#### Source of Enzyme
The enzyme can be prepared from any tetracycline-producing strain of Streptomyces aureus or S. rimosus as well as various mutants blocked at points prior to the methylation reaction. The latter are preferred since cell extracts from them do not contain any of

² U.S. Patent 3,265,732 (1966).

the substrate for the methylation reaction, and controls containing no substrate will therefore show little or no incorporation of label from \[^{14}CH_3\]S-adenosylmethionine.

[47] NADP:Tetracycline 5a(11a)Dehydrogenase

By PHILIP A. MILLER and JOHN H. HASH

Enzymic reduction of the 5a-11a double bond has been shown to be the final reaction in the biosynthesis of the tetracycline group of antibiotics. The reaction occurs in antibiotic-producing strains of *Streptomyces aureofaciens* as well as in various blocked mutants derived therefrom. Of the various 5a(11a)-dehydrotetracyclines which have been prepared, only 7-chloro-5a(11a)-dehydrotetracycline is chemically stable; we have therefore chosen it as the substrate to illustrate the reaction described here.

### Assay Method

#### Principle
The presence of 5a(11a) dehydrogenase activity can be determined by measuring an increase in antibacterial activity due to the synthesis of 7-chlorotetracycline from its inactive precursor, 7-chloro-5a(11a)-dehydrotetracycline. Any tetracycline-sensitive bacteria can be used, and either a turbidimetric or agar-diffusion type assay is suitable.

### Reagents

- Tris·HCl buffer, 0.2 M, pH 7.0
- NADPH, 2 mM in water
- 7-Chloro-5a(11a)-dehydrotetracycline, 1 mM in methanol
