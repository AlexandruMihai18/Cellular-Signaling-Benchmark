**ABSTRACT**

Vascular hyperpermeability associated with retinal vascular leakage is known to occur in patients with diabetes, and contributes to endothelial barrier dysfunction. This study aimed to examine the effect of pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) on advanced glycation end products (AGEs)-induced endothelial cell permeability. Cultured porcine retinal endothelial cell (PREC) was exposed to AGE-modified bovine serum albumin (AGE-BSA) and the endothelial cell permeability was detected by measuring the flux of rhodamine B isothiocyanate (RITC)-dextran across the PREC monolayers. We found that AGE-BSA increased the RITC-dextran flux across a PREC monolayer and PEDF blocked the solute flux induced by AGE-BSA. In order to explore the underlying signaling mechanism of PEDF on the inhibitory effect of AGE-BSA-induced permeability, we demonstrate that PEDF could inhibit the AGE-BSA-induced permeability via phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway. AGE-BSA also increased the endothelial cell permeability by stimulating the reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation via NADPH oxidase activity and Akt phosphorylation at Ser473. PEDF decreased ROS generation in AGE-BSA-exposed endothelial cells by suppressing the NADPH oxidase activity via down regulating the phosphorylation of p22 ${ }^{\mathrm{PHOX}}$ at Thr147. This led to blockade of AGE-induction of PI3K/Akt activation in permeability. Furthermore, PEDF inhibited the AGE-BSA-induced permeability by increased expression of tight junction protein zona occludens-1 (ZO-1), co-incident with an increase in barrier properties of endothelial monolayer. Together, our results indicate that PEDF could possibly act as potent anti-permeability molecule by targeting the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway by suppressing if NADPH oxidase mediated ROS generation and ZO-1 tight junction protein and it offers potential targets to inhibit the ocular related diseases such as diabetic retinopathy.

**1. Introduction**

Increased vascular permeability and retinal neovascularization are major aspects of many diseases such as diabetic retinopathy (DR). Although the physiologic importance of maintaining the normal vascular integrity is well appreciated, an understanding of how vascular integrity is maintained, and whether vascular permeability can be down-regulated, remains elusive. The activity of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) in promoting retinal vascular hyperpermeability is well established [1]. In addition, the accumulation of AGEs, the ultimate result of nonenzymatic glycation of proteins and lipids [2,3], in tissues has been correlated with the development of complications in diabetes [2,4,5]. Recent studies revealed that AGEs and their receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) interaction play a central role in the pathogenesis of diabetic vascular complications [6–8]. AGEs are known to accumulate in the vascular cells and neural retina of diabetic animals [9,10] where they appear to initiate pathophysiological changes in retinal microvascular function.

AGEs are known to modify proteins, such as bovine serum albumin (BSA) and collagen at lysine and/or arginine residues and stimulate the growth of microvascular endothelial cells by an autocrine induction of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)

leading to angiogenesis [11]. AGEs levels are elevated in the retinal vessels of diabetic patients, and the levels in serum can be correlated with the severity of retinopathy by induction of blood-retinal barrier (BRB) dysfunction [12]. The tight junction (TJ) is essential to establish the tight barrier between endothelial cells in the retinal and brain blood vessels in order to maintain the proper environment for neuronal function [13]. Breakdown of this BRB is a major causative factor in DR and correlates directly with the macular edema leading to vision loss [13–15]. Therefore, understanding this TJ complex and how it is regulated is essential to develop new therapies for DR. However, the mechanism underlying AGE-induced retinal vascular leakage has not been well documented yet.

Pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF), a 50-kDa glycoprotein synthesized by the retinal pigment epithelium layer, belongs to the superfamily of serine protease inhibitors with neuronal differentiating activity [16,17]. More recently, PEDF has been found to be a potent anti-angiogenic factor as it specifically inhibits the proliferation and migration of endothelial cells [16,18] and effectively suppresses ischemia-induced retinal neovascularization in animal models [19,20]. Many clinical studies have reported that PEDF levels in aqueous or vitreous humor are decreased in patients encountering proliferative DR [21].

Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) is a signal transduction enzyme that catalyses the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate (PIP₂) to form phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP₃) in response to activation of either receptor tyrosine kinase, G-protein coupled receptors or cytokine receptors, which ultimately regulate cell growth, differentiation, survival, proliferation, migration and cytokine production [22,23]. Akt (protein kinase B), is probably the best characterized downstream protein activated via PI3K by various extracellular stimuli [24]. However, the involvement of PI3K/Akt activity during AGE-BSA-induced permeability is unclear.

Reduced nicotiamide adenine dinucleotide (NADPH) oxidase is an enzyme primarily identified in professional phagocytes such as neutrophils and macrophages [25,26]. NADPH oxidase, a multi-component enzyme, is composed of the membrane-bound subunits p22phox and gp91phox (also termed as NOX2) as well as the cytosolic subunits p67phox and p47phox. Non-phagocytic NADPH oxidase is structurally and functionally similar to phagocytic NADPH oxidase, excluding some features. For example, unlike the phagocytic type, non-phagocytic NADPH oxidase is constitutively active, producing relatively low levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) under basal conditions and generating higher levels of oxidants in response to cytokines and growth factors. PI-3K was also shown to participate in the activation of NADPH oxidase [27] increasing the production of ROS. Increased ROS production, however results in the stimulation of redox-sensitive intracellular signaling pathways [28] thereby mediating various processes including vascular hyperpermeability [1]. Recently, PEDF was reported to inhibit the AGE-signaling pathway in retinal hyperpermeability and angiogenesis and it also blocks the AGE-induced vascular cell injury by suppressing reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in vitro [1,29]. Therefore, PEDF may play a protective role against DR by attenuating the deleterious effect of AGEs. However, the complete mechanism behind the inhibitory action of PEDF on AGE-BSA-induced permeability in retinal endothelial cells remains to be elucidated.

In the present study, we have investigated the molecular mechanism of PEDF on AGE-BSA-induced permeability in endothelial cells from porcine retina. The effect of PEDF on AGE-BSA-induced permeability in porcine retinal endothelial cells via PI3K/ Akt dependent pathway was studied. In addition to this, the role of PEDF on the modulation of AGE-BSA-induced ROS generation via NADPH oxidase activity and tight junction protein ZO-1 was also

investigated. The results obtained from this study may provide better insights for understanding the molecular mechanism of PEDF in AGE-BSA-induced vascular permeability and this elucidation might lead to the emergence of PEDF as a potential therapeutic molecule to inhibit the ocular diseases such as DR.

## 2. Materials and methods

### 2.1. Isolation and culture of endothelial cells

Porcine retinal endothelial cells (PRECs) were isolated and cultured as described previously [30]. Briefly, the retinas were isolated from porcine eyes and washed with minimum essential medium (MEM; Sigma St Louis, MO) with 100 U/ml penicillin (Sigma St Louis, MO) and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Sigma St Louis, MO) and cut into 3 mm segments and transferred into a 15-ml centrifuge tube (BD Falcon, USA) containing an enzyme cocktail which consisted of 500 μg/ml of collagenase of type IV (Sigma St Louis, MO), 250 μg/ml of pronase (Biochemika, Sigma, Buchs) and 250 μg/ml of DNase (Sigma St Louis, MO) in 1× phosphate buffered saline (1× PBS, pH 7.4). The enzyme mixture was vortexed for 10–15 s to disaggregate the tissue and kept at 37 °C for 30 min. The resultant enzyme digest was passed through 53 μm steel mesh (W.S Tyler, UK). The trapped vessels were washed with MEM medium by centrifugation at 400×g for 5 min. The pellet containing micro-vessel fragments were finally suspended in Iscove’s modified dulbecco’s medium (IMDM; Sigma St Louis, MO) with growth supplements and seeded in a 35 × 10 mm tissue-culture dish (BD Falcon, USA) coated with 1.5% porcine gelatin type A (Sigma St Louis, MO), and incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO₂. The PRECs were characterized by using endothelial cells specific markers such as vWF, CD31, CD146 (Chemicon International, CA). Cells from fourth and fifth passages were used for all experiments.

### 2.2. Plasmid constructs and transient transfection assay

Constitutively active (myristoylated) Akt (CA Akt) and dominant negative (K179M) Akt (DN Akt) mutants were kindly provided by Dr. Kyung-Jin Lee (Department of Life Science, GIST, Korea). PRECs were transiently transfected using nucleofection technique (Amaxa Biosystems, Koeln, Germany) and grown to 80% confluence in IMDM. Briefly for transfection, cells were harvested by trypsinization and centrifuged at 3000×g for 10 min. The pellet was resuspended in the nucleofector solution (Basic nucleofector kit, Amaxa Inc, Germany) to a final concentration of 4–5 × 10⁵ cells/100 μl. At the time of transfection, 1–3 μg of plasmid DNA encoding green fluorescent protein (pmaxGFP), constitutively active Akt or dominant negative Aktplasmid was added along with a nucleofector solution and subjected to electroporation using a nucleofector device-II (Amaxa Biosystems, Koeln, Germany: Program M-003). After electroporation, transfected cells were resuspended in 35 × 15 mm gelatin-coated dishes containing 1 ml of prewarmed IMDM containing 10% FBS, and incubated in 5% CO₂ at 37 °C. The transfection efficiency determined after co-transfection with a pmaxGFP plasmid (Amaxa Inc.) and the cell viability, determined by MTT assay, was usually about 80–90%.

### 2.3. Seeding the endothelial cells into permeable insert systems

PRECs at passage four (both wild and mutant) were seeded in growth medium (IMDM) onto gelatin-coated membranes of permeable insert systems (Transwell, Corning Inc, Costar 3460, USA, 12-mm diameter, pore size 0.4 μm, growth area 0.33 cm² per well) with a seeding density of 30 000 cells/cm². The medium was
renewed everyday. 500 μl medium was also added to the lower chamber of the insert systems.

2.4. Transwell monolayer permeability assay

Permeability assays were performed 4 days after seeding, when a confluent monolayer of endothelial cells were present. Chambers were examined microscopically for confluence, integrity, and uniformity of endothelial cell monolayers. Before performing the experiment the cells were incubated for 6 h with medium (IMDM) containing only 0.5% FBS (in contrast to 10% in the growth medium normally) and antibiotics, followed by the treatment with AGE-BSA and PEDF. To determine the permeability through cell monolayers fluorescent-dye Rhodamine B isothiocyanate (RITC)-Dextran (Sigma St Louis, MO) (with a molecular weight of 70-kDa and a diameter of about 6 nm) based assay as reported previously was used [31]. The small fluorescent molecule permeates through the endothelial cells in the absence of the tight junction as well as through the endothelial cell fenestrations into the basolateral chamber [32], whose amount is used to determine the leakage properties of the monolayer. The amount of dextran in the basolateral chamber is directly proportional to the permeability of endothelial cells. This dextran solute flux was then quantified by means of quantification of increase in fluorescence in the basolateral chamber.

For assays relating to the inhibitors LY294002 & Akt inhibitor IV and PEDF, the molecules were added 30 min prior to the addition of AGE-BSA. Also the transfected cells were treated with AGE-BSA. Similar to wild type cells, every hour 100 μl of the solution from the basolateral chamber was removed and measured for the fluorescence. The samples were diluted 1:1 with medium in the assay plate and permeability of the endothelial cell monolayer was measured by detecting the fluorescence in a multi-well microplate reader (Biotek, Model FLx800, Vermont, USA) at an excitation/emission wavelength of 540/590 nm. A sample was taken from the apical chamber at the last time point; the amount of fluorescence in this chamber did not change significantly over the course of the experiment.

2.5. In vitro kinase assay for PI3K enzyme activity

The PI3K enzyme activity of PRECs was measured by the competitive immunoassay as described previously [33]. Briefly, 2 × 10⁶ cells were seeded in a 35 × 10 mm tissue-culture dish and grown for 24 h. After the cells had attached and grown to confluence, the monolayer was starved for 6 h in IMDM with 0.5% FBS. After various treatments, cells were harvested by trypsinization and homogenized in the presence of protease inhibitors. Protein concentrations were determined using Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.). The amount of phosphatidylinositol-3, 4, 5-triphosphate (PIP3) produced was quantified by PIP3 competition enzyme immunoassays according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Echelon, Inc., Salt Lake City, UT). The enzyme activity was expressed as amounts of PIP3 (picomoles per milliliter) produced by 1 ml of cell extracts containing equal amounts of protein.

2.6. NADPH oxidase assay

NADPH oxidase activity was determined based on superoxide-induced lucigenin photoemission as described previously [1]. Briefly, PRECs were treated with 100 μg/ml of AGE-BSA or nonglycated BSA in the presence or absence of 10 nM PEDF, 10 μM LY294002 and 10 μM Akt inhibitor for 24 h, and then the cells were suspended in homogenization buffer (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.0, 100 mM KCl, and 1 mM EDTA containing protease inhibitor cocktails). NADPH oxidase activity of the cell homogenate was measured by luminescence assay in 50 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 1 mM EGTA, 150 mM sucrose, 5 μM lucigenin as the electron acceptor, and 100 μM NADPH as a substrate. Photoemission expressed in terms of relative light units (RLU) was measured every min for 5 min using luminometer. Assays were carried out in the dark at room temperature with appropriate controls.

2.7. Western blot analysis

PRECs were cultured in IMDM supplemented with 10% FBS. Before treatment of the PRECs, the medium was replaced with IMDM containing 0.5% FBS and incubated for 5 h, and then treated with AGE-BSA (10 μg/ml). In some experiments, PRECs were transfected with CA Akt and DN Akt before the AGE-BSA stimulation. After washing with PBS, cells were lysed with lysis buffer containing 50 mM Tris–HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM PMSF, 1 mM Na₃VO₄, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Na-pyrophosphate and a protease inhibitors (Sigma St. Louis, MO) and protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc., Hercules, CA), as described previously [29]. Samples (30 μg of protein per lane) were loaded on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis at 120 V for 90 min, separated proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes by the wet transfer method (250 mA, 90 min). Nonspecific sites were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline Tween 20 buffer (TBST; 25 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.1% Tween20) for 1 h, and the blots were then incubated with an anti-phosphorylated Akt antibody (Ser473)(Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), anti-phosphorylated p22<sup>PHOX</sup> antibody at Threonine 147(Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. USA) and total anti-Akt antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), overnight at 4 °C. Anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase conjugated-IgG was used to detect binding of antibodies. The binding of the specific antibody was visualized by exposing to a photographic film after treating with enhanced chemiluminescence's system reagents.

2.8. Measurement of intracellular ROS generation

The ROS generation was determined using the Nitrotetrazolium blue (NBT) reduction assay as described previously by [34] with minor modifications. The assay is based on the reduction of the yellow water-soluble NBT powder to formazan, insoluble substance upon reduction. Briefly, treated cells (1 × 10⁶ cells/100 μl) were incubated with NBT solution for 1 h in the incubation medium. The reaction was stopped by the addition of one vol. of acetic acid. After centrifugation (12 000×g for 2 min), intracellular reduced NBT was solubilized by adding 150 ml of 50% (v/v) acetic acid to the cell pellet followed by vortexing for 5 min. Cell debris was finally pelleted and the absorbance of the supernatant determined at 595 nm in a 96-well plate reader (bio-rad, Model 680, Japan).

2.9. Immunocytochemistry analysis

Immunofluorescent staining of ZO-1 was performed using a modified protocol described earlier [35]. PRECs grown on transwell filters were washed once with PBS containing 1 mM CaCl₂ (PBS-Ca). Cells were fixed for 20 min in 4% formaldehyde in PBS and then permeabilized in PBS with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were blocked for 1 h with PBS-Ca containing 10% FBS and 0.1% Tween 20. Permeabilized cells were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies. Rabbit anti-ZO-1 antibody was diluted in PBS containing 0.5% FBS and 0.1% Tween 20 in a 1:100 dilution. Cells were washed with PBS-Tween (PBS with 0.1% Tween 20) and stained with FITC-labeled secondary

antibodies at a 1:100 dilution in PBS-Tween for 1 h at room temperature. Cells then were rinsed three times in PBS-Tween, mounted in 90% glycerol in PBS, and examined with a leica confocal microscope.

### 2.10. Densitometric analyses and statistics

All immunoreactive and phosphorylation signals were analyzed by densitometric scanning (Alpha Imager 2200 Gel documentation system, Alpha Innotech, California). All results were expressed as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM) values. Statistical significance difference was evaluated using ANOVA followed by a paired two-tailed student's t-test for comparison with the control group. A level of \( P < 0.05 \) was considered to be statistically significant.

## 3. Results

### 3.1. AGE-BSA increases permeability of retinal endothelial cells in a dose-dependent manner

In order to evaluate the ability of AGE-BSA in inducing permeability in endothelial cells, PRECs were grown to confluence on transwell filters and then treated with AGE-BSA at different concentrations. AGE-BSA-induced a dose-dependent increase in the permeability of the endothelial cell monolayer to RITC-labeled dextran at 12 h with maximal permeability observed at a concentration of 10 μg/ml of AGE-BSA (Fig. 1), when compared to non-glycated BSA. The effect of AGE-BSA on permeability persisted for more than 24 h duration of the experiment.

### 3.2. PEDF inhibits endothelial cell permeability in a dose-dependent manner

Previous in vivo studies have demonstrated that PEDF inhibits VEGF-induced retinal vascular permeability [36]. Since PEDF is known to have different effects on different types of cells [37] in addition to endothelial cells, we determined the role of PEDF on retinal endothelial cell permeability. PEDF reduced the permeability of PRECs to RITC-dextran compared with control (0.5% FBS) in a statistically significant fashion (Fig. 2). The inhibitory effect of PEDF was dose-dependent, reaching a maximum at 10 nM and a very less significant degree of inhibition occurred at lower doses. In addition, the effect of PEDF on permeability also persisted over the 24 h duration of the experiment.

### 3.3. PEDF inhibits AGE-BSA-induced endothelial cell permeability

Since PEDF blocked the permeability in PRECs, we sought to determine whether PEDF has any inhibitory effect on AGE-BSA-induced PRECs permeability. In this experiment, PEDF was added 30 min prior to AGE-BSA treatment. PEDF treatment has inhibited the AGE-BSA induced permeability in PRECs. Also, the inhibition of AGE-BSA-induced permeability by PEDF occurred in a dose-dependent fashion; 10 nM PEDF was sufficient to inhibit AGE-BSA-induced permeability to the level of control (Fig. 3). This result suggests that PEDF completely abrogated the AGE-BSA-induced increase in permeability to RITC-dextran.

### 3.4. Effect of PI3K/Akt inhibitor on AGE-BSA-induced endothelial cell permeability

The pro-survival function of growth factor signaling occurs through the PI3K/Akt pathway, and Akt is a critical regulator of PI3K-mediated cell survival [27]. Therefore, we investigated the involvement of the PI3K/Akt pathway in AGE-BSA-induced permeability in PRECs using the specific pharmacological inhibitor. Both LY294002 (10 μM) and Akt Inhibitor IV (10 μM) could effectively block the permeability induced by AGE-BSA (10 μg/ml) during the treatment and the inhibition was comparable to that of the 0.5% FBS (Fig. 4). This result suggests that AGE-BSA-induced increase in permeability to RITC-dextran via PI3K/Akt dependent pathway.

### 3.5. Effect of PEDF and PI3K/Akt inhibitor on AGE-BSA-induced PI3K enzyme activity in PRECs

To support the contention that effects of PI3K/Akt inhibitor and PEDF on AGE-BSA-induced permeability specifically directed through the blocking of PI3K pathway, we performed PIP3 competition enzyme immunoassay to measure PI3K enzyme activity. The PI3K activity in PRECs was increased at 12 h after AGE-BSA

PRECs were grown to confluent monolayers on porous membranes were incubated with the indicated PEDF doses, and the flux of RITC-dextran from the upper to the lower chamber was measured 6, 12, 18, 24 h after treatment. Values are expressed in relative fluorescence counts (RFCs) as mean ± SEM, with each condition performed at least in triplicate ($n = 3$, $*P < 0.05$ vs control, $**P < 0.01$ vs control). The figure is representative of three experiments with similar results.

treatment compared with the control (Fig. 5), whereas the increased PI3K activity in PRECs after AGE-BSA treatment was significantly decreased by the pre-incubation of LY294002 (10 μM), and/or PEDF (10 nM) treatments. However, significant changes in PI3K activity were not observed in AGE-BSA treated with Akt inhibitor IV (10 μM) suggesting that there is a possible involvement of Akt protein as a downstream molecule in AGE-BSA-induced PI3K activity.

### 3.6. Akt mediates AGE-BSA-induction of endothelial cell permeability

To verify further the role of Akt activity in the regulation of endothelial cell permeability, PRECs were transfected with plasmid encoding dominant negative (K179M) Akt (DN Akt) and constitutive active (myristoylated) Akt (CA Akt) and grown to confluence in transwell permeability assay plate, and the effect of AGE-BSA on endothelial cell permeability was measured as just described above. Analysis of serum-deprived PRECs revealed that transfection of CA Akt has significantly increased endothelial cell permeability whereas transfection of DN Akt has decreased the cell permeability significantly. DN Akt mutant cells blocked AGE-BSA-mediated permeability to the level of control (Fig. 6), whereas CA Akt meant cells lead to a substantial increase in the endothelial cell permeability; stimulation of these cells with AGE-BSA treatment had an additive effect on cell permeability which indicates that Akt activation is necessary for the induction of endothelial cell permeability. These data suggest that Akt kinase activity plays an important role in mediating the permeability of AGE-BSA.

### 3.7. AGE-BSA-induced Akt phosphorylation in PRECs

To examine whether AGE-BSA-induced permeability by altering PI3K/Akt phosphorylation, we performed western blotting to determine the status of Akt phosphorylation at the Ser473 residue

Fig. 3. Effect of PEDF on AGE-BSA-induced endothelial cell permeability. PRECs were grown to confluent monolayers on porous membranes were incubated with AGE-BSA (10 μg/ml) and PEDF (10 nM), and the flux of RITC-dextran from the upper to the lower chamber was measured 12 after treatment. PEDF was added 30 min prior to AGE-BSA treatment. Pre-treatment of PEDF significantly blocks the AGE-BSA-induced permeability to the level of control (0.5% serum). Values are expressed in relative fluorescence counts (RFCs) as mean ± SEM, with each condition performed at least in triplicate.

The lower chamber was incubated with AGE-BSA (10 μg/ml) and in the presence or absence of LY294002 (10 μM) and Akt inhibitor IV (10 μM) for 12 h at 37 °C. LY294002 and Akt inhibitor IV was added 30 min prior to AGE-BSA treatment. Both LY294002 and Akt inhibitor IV significantly inhibits the AGE-BSA-induced cell permeability by 2 fold. The flux of RITC-dextran from the upper to the lower chamber was measured 12 h after growth factor treatment. Data are mean ± SEM representing similar results was obtained in three independent experiments.

using anti-phospho-Akt (Serine 473) and total Akt using anti-Akt antibody in PRECs. Levels of phosphorylated Akt protein in the cell extracts were significantly increased at 24 h after AGE-BSA treatments compared with the levels in the control. DN Akt mutant cells blocked AGE-BSA-mediated Akt phosphorylation to the level of control, whereas CA Akt mutant cells lead to a substantial increase in the Akt phosphorylation; stimulation of these cells with AGE-BSA treatment had an additive effect on Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 7A). Fig. 7B shows the densitometry analysis and it was found that AGE-BSA-induced the Akt phosphorylation significantly. For a loading control, membranes were stripped and reprobed for total Akt and no significant changes in total Akt protein levels were observed in any of the groups tested. These data suggest that Akt kinase activity plays an important role in mediating the permeability of AGE-BSA.

3.8. Constitutively active Akt modulates the anti-permeability effect of PEDF

To determine whether modulation of Akt was responsible for the anti-permeability effect of PEDF, PRECs were transfected with a plasmid encoding CA Akt and DN Akt, and then treated with PEDF and specific Akt inhibitor. It was shown that AGE-BSA-induced endothelial cell permeability in an Akt-dependent manner. Both the Akt inhibitor IV and the DN Akt mutant cells completely

Serum-starved PRECs were treated with AGE-BSA (10 μg/ml) in the presence or absence of PEDF and/or LY294002 or Akt inhibitor IV for 30 min. Cells were harvested using ice-cold PBS and homogenized with protease inhibitors. PI3K was immunoprecipitated with polyclonal antibody against the regulatory subunit p85 and assayed for ability to phosphorylate 4, 5-phosphorylated lipid. The amount of PIP3 generation by PI3Ks was expressed as enzyme activity in pmol/ml. PEDF and LY294002 significantly inhibited the AGE-BSA-induced PI3K activity whereas no such significant inhibition of PI3K activity were seen in AGE-BSA treated with Akt inhibitor IV. Data are mean ± SEM representing the identical results of three independent experiments (*P < 0.05 vs control, **P < 0.01 vs control).

PRECs were transiently transfected with DNA encoding dominant negative (K179M) Akt (DN Akt) and constitutive active (myristoylated) Akt (CA Akt). Transfected PRECs were grown to confluent monolayer on porous membranes (12-well transwell insert plate) and then incubated with or without AGE-BSA for 12 h at 37 °C. The DN Akt mutant significantly blocked the AGE-BSA-induced permeability to the level of the control (0.5% FBS), whereas CA Akt had an additive effect after the AGE-BSA exposure. Values are expressed in relative fluorescence counts (RFCs) as mean ± SEM, with each condition performed at least in triplicate (*P < 0.05 vs control, **P < 0.01 vs control).

there is a possible involvement of Akt protein as a downstream molecule in AGE-BSA-induced NADPH oxidase activity.

3.10. PEDF inhibits the AGE-BSA induced phosphorylation of p22<sup>PHOX</sup> in PRECs

To detect whether NADPH oxidase subunits are expressed in PRECs during treatment with AGE-BSA, western blot was performed using specific antibody for p22<sup>PHOX</sup> proteins. Further, we examined status of p22<sup>PHOX</sup> when PRECs were pre-treated with PEDF and PI3K/Akt inhibitor. It was observed that, PEDF blocked the AGE-BSA-induced p22<sup>PHOX</sup> phosphorylation at threonine 147 (Fig. 10A). Fig. 10B shows the densitometry analysis and it was found that PEDF inhibits the AGE-BSA-induced the p22<sup>PHOX</sup> phosphorylation significantly. For a loading control, membranes were stripped and reprobed for total p22<sup>PHOX</sup> and no significant changes in total p22<sup>PHOX</sup> protein levels were observed in any of the groups tested. These data suggest that p22<sup>PHOX</sup> is the critical component for NADPH oxidase activity induced by AGE-BSA. Further, LY294002 also inhibited the phosphorylation of p22<sup>PHOX</sup> as similar to PEDF where as the Akt inhibitor did not have any effect on the phosphorylation of p22<sup>PHOX</sup>. Hence, based on the results of both NADPH oxidase activity and phosphorylation studies of p22<sup>PHOX</sup> it can be concluded there is potential involvement of Akt as a possible downstream molecule which further may aid the generation of ROS, thus resulting in the enhanced permeability.

3.11. PEDF inhibits the AGE-BSA-induced ROS generation in PRECs

ROS generated by AGE-BSA plays an important role in the development of vascular permeability related diabetic complications. To determine whether PEDF could inhibit AGE-BSA-induced ROS generation, NBT assay was used. AGE-BSA-induced the production of ROS in PRECs, this was completely blocked by PEDF. Incubation of PRECs with 10 μg/ml AGE-BSA resulted in a two-fold increase in the ROS generation relative to the non-glycated BSA and untreated control (Fig. 11). Whereas treatment with 10 nM PEDF significantly decreased the AGE-BSA-induced rise in ROS generation in PRECs. Further, to determine the anti-oxidative ability of PEDF in inhibiting AGE-BSA-induced H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production, oxidative stress was induced in PRECs using 100 μM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (positive control) in the presence and absence of PEDF. Incubation with PEDF significantly decreased the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced ROS generation. Further, to address the signaling pathways leading to ROS production and to evaluate whether AGE-BSA-induced ROS production is PI3-kinase/Akt dependent, we used pharmacologic inhibitors of these signaling molecules. PRECs were treated with LY294002 (PI3-kinase inhibitor) and Akt inhibitor IV for 30 min before being stimulated with AGE-BSA. The results show that AGE-BSA-induced production of ROSs was significantly decreased by pre-treatment with PEDF and PI3-kinase/Akt inhibitor in PRECs.

3.12. PEDF increases the tight junction protein ZO-1 expression

The role of PEDF in AGE-BSA-mediated vascular permeability was further studied by finding its impact on the ZO-1 content in PRECs. Our confocal microscopy experiments demonstrated that treatment with AGE-BSA disrupted ZO-1 content in PRECs compared to the untreated control. Pre-treatment with PEDF significantly abolished this effect of AGE-BSA. We found by immunocytochemistry analysis that the localization of ZO-1 at the cell–cell contacts of confluent endothelial cells (Fig. 12). ZO-1, normally found along the cell boundaries, became clustered in patchy aggregates in the cytoplasm after AGE-BSA treatment. The tightly organized and discrete localization of ZO-1 in the control

Fig. 8. Constitutive active Akt enhances the endothelial cell permeability and prevents the PEDF-related effect in PRECs. PRECs were transiently transfected with DNA encoding CA Akt and DA Akt. Transfected cells were grown to confluent monolayers on porous membranes and then incubated with PEDF(10 nM) and Akt inhibitor IV (10 μM) for 12 h at 37 °C where the block in the permeability by PEDF and Akt inhibitor IV in wild type cells, was rescued in CA Akt mutant cells. Combination effect of AGE-BSA and PEDF in CA Akt cells shows the significant effect when compared to CA Akt alone (**P < 0.01 vs CA Akt). Values are expressed in relative fluorescence counts (RFCs) as mean ± SEM, with each condition performed at least in triplicate(n = 3, *P < 0.05 vs control).

cells was in contrast to the disrupted localization and aggregation of these proteins in response to AGE-BSA treatment. PEDF treatment significantly prevented the disruption of ZO-1 localization by AGE-BSA. Taken together, these data suggest that AGE-BSA induces permeability in PRECs by altering the organization of ZO-1 and by the subsequent loss of tight junctions between the cell monolayers. This disruption is blocked by PEDF by increasing the ZO-1 expression in endothelial cells thereby blocking the AGE-BSA-induced permeability.

### 4. Discussion

Endothelial dysfunction plays a major role in the pathophysiology of human vascular disease including DR. The macromolecule and leukocyte trafficking through the blood vessel is regulated by the endothelial cells, thereby forming a semi-selective barrier. Under conditions of oxidative stress a variety of ROS may be generated, which increase the permeability of the endothelial monolayer to fluid, macromolecules and inflammatory cells. In this study, we have demonstrated that PEDF could inhibit the AGE-BSA elicited retinal vascular hyperpermeability by interrupting PI3K/

Akt signaling pathway in retinal endothelial cells. Results of the present study indicate that AGE-BSA increases endothelial monolayer permeability in a concentration and time-dependent manner, and that the hyperpermeability is inhibited by suppression of ROS generation and increased expression of ZO-1 expression would be a central mechanism for the anti-permeability effects of PEDF, thus

Then, the enzyme activity of NADPH oxidase was measured as described in Methods. AGE-BSA significantly induces the NADPH oxidase activity compared with non-glycated BSA (*P < 0.01 vs BSA) whereas PEDF and LY294002 treatment significantly reduced the NADPH oxidase in the presence and absence of AGE-BSA (*P < 0.05 vs AGE-BSA treatment). NADPH oxidase was presented as the percentage of control (0.5% serum) and data are mean ± SEM representing the identical results of three independent experiments.

been provided for the involvement of AGEs and RAGEs on endothelial cells, pericytes, smooth muscle cells, dendritic cells, monocyte cells and infiltrating mononuclear phagocytes in the diabetic vasculature [40–42]. AGEs are known to induce angiogenic effects through multiple survival signals [43,44], including the secretion of VEGF, which exerts an autocrine action in a variety of endothelial cells and other cell types. Previous reports show that AGE-BSA has mitogenic effect on endothelial cells [38,45]. In this study also, AGE-BSA treatment was also found to significantly increase the endothelial cell permeability in a dose-dependent manner in PRECs.

PEDF has been shown as a potent endogenous and effectual inhibitor of angiogenesis which is seven times as potent as endostatin and more than two times as potent as angiostatin [16]. Under normal conditions the molecule counteracts the stimulatory effect of several pro-angiogenic factors, thus preventing ocular neovascularization [16,21,22]. Previous studies have shown that PEDF inhibits VEGF-induced angiogenesis by suppressing phosphorylation of VEGF receptor-1 and therefore, PEDF could maintain cell-cell junctional integrity by blocking VEGF-downstream signaling [46]. Recently, it was reported that PEDF generates the anti-permeability signal through the inactivation of the p22phox and gp91phox expression [1]. Thus, to validate PEDF as a potent anti-permeability molecule; we studied the effect of PEDF on AGE-BSA-induced permeability action in PRECs. Consistent with

Fig. 11. Effect of PEDF on AGE-BSA-induced intracellular ROS generation in PRECs. PRECs were incubated with AGE-BSA (10 μg) or H₂O₂ (100 μM) in the presence or absence of PEDF and PI3K/Akt inhibitor for 12 h. Then, the intracellular formation of ROS was measured as described in Methods. AGE-BSA and H₂O₂ significantly induces the ROS generation (*P < 0.05 vs BSA) and PEDF treatment significantly reduced the ROS generation in the presence and absence of AGE-BSA (**P < 0.01 vs AGE-BSA treatment). ROS generation was presented as the percentage of control (0.5% serum) and data are mean ± SEM representing the identical results of three independent experiments.

providing a therapeutic potential for PEDF for the treatment of DR at early conditions.

AGEs are one among the important causatives of vascular complication like DR [7,38,39]. Many possible explanations have

Fig. 12. Cellular distribution of ZO-1 protein. PRECs monolayer cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, washed with PBS, and then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100. The cells were blocked with 10% normal FBS for 1 h at 27 °C. After three washes with PBS the cells were sequentially incubated with primary antibody (Anti-ZO-1, 10 μg/ml) for 1 h at 27 °C and washed extensively with PBS; and then incubated with secondary alexa fluor® 488 anti-mouse IgG antibody (Molecular Probe) for 1 h at 27 °C. Cells were washed with PBS and then mounted with aqua poly/mount (Polysciences Inc, PA). Confocal microscopy images of four experiments were analyzed. Acquired images of alexa fluor® 488 fluorescence were collected and each section was analyzed on a pixel-by-pixel basis utilizing physiology software V 3.0 (Carl Zeiss, Inc., Thornwood, NY) to assess localization of ZO-1 protein.

previous observations [1,47], our data demonstrated the anti-
permeability effect of PEDF on AGE-BSA-induced permeability in
endothelial cells. In addition, we observed that PEDF (10 nM) alone
significantly inhibits cell permeability and also AGE-BSA-induced
cell permeability in PRECs.

Several downstream signaling molecules are important for
cellular processes like proliferation and survival, where Phosphatidyl-
inositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and its downstream regulator, Akt,
play a critical role [23,24]. However, the distinct signal transduction
mechanism leading to the anti-permeability action of PEDF in AGE-
BSA-induced PI3K/Akt signaling in retinal endothelial system has
not yet been established. In the present study, we show that AGE-
BSA-induced vascular permeability via the PI3K/Akt dependent
pathway in the porcine retinal endothelial system. It is noteworthy
that we obtained results indicating that AGE-BSA-induced perme-
ability was inhibited by LY294002 (10 μM) and Akt inhibitor IV
(10 μM), suggesting the role of PI3K/Akt in the AGE-BSA-induced
vascular permeability in PRECs. In addition, AGE-BSA increases the
PI3K enzyme activity using a PIP3 competition enzyme immuno-
assay. Further, the CA Akt (myristoylated) mutant cells were suffi-
cient to ensure the permeability of serum-starved endothelial cells
in the presence of PEDF. In contrast, the DN Akt mutant cells
blocked the permeability effect of AGE-BSA. These findings also
suggest that the PI3K/Akt signaling is a crucial element in cell
permeability and that its inhibition is crucial in the anti-perme-
ability activity of PEDF. In addition, our study confirms that PEDF
significantly inhibits the AGE-BSA-induced PI3K enzyme activity as
effectively as the PI3-kinase inhibitor LY294002.

Akt, by phosphorylating key regulating proteins at serine and
threonine residues which are present in the Arg-Xaa-Arg-Xaa-Xaa-
Ser/Thr motifs and play a central role in tumorigenesis [48,49]. In
the present study, we have analyzed whether the PI3K/Akt
signaling is involved when PRECs are induced by AGE-BSA. CA Akt
enhances endothelial leakage by inducing the phosphorylation of
Akt at Ser473 irrespective of AGE-BSA concentration, and DN Akt
blocked the AGE-BSA-mediated Akt phosphorylation effect at
Ser473. Further, PEDF and PI3K/Akt inhibitors blocked the AGE-
BSA-induced PI3K enzyme activity in wild type PRECs. These find-
ings constitute, to the best of our knowledge, the first preliminary
data showing a role played by the PI3K/Akt pathway in mediating
an AGE-BSA-induced vascular permeability in PRECs and its inhi-
bition by PEDF. Studies investigating the effect of PEDF on other
signaling pathways induced by AGEs in retinal endothelial cells
should be performed in the future.

Previously, AGEs have been shown to promote ROS formation
and oxidative stress in diabetes and aging-related diseases. Besides
hyperglycemia which induce the production of ROS within the cell
[50], increased cellular ROS can also arise from AGEs in the absence
of elevated glucose; e.g., from myeloperoxidase and nicotinamide
adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase or from lipids
[51–53]. ROS may be increased via activation of AGE-sensitive cell
surface receptors, such as RAGE [54,55] or non receptor-dependent
pathways, causing activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase
(MAPK)/Ras and nuclear factor (NF)-κB, as well as of Akt, forkhead
transcription factors (FOXO), p38, or c-JUN pathways, which can
promote both inflammatory responses or cellular apoptosis [56,57].
Here the increase in the ROS generation via PI3K/Akt can be sup-
pressed by PEDF resulting in decreased oxidative stress and Akt
activation in PRECs permeability. Previously, Inagaki et al. [58]
showed that PEDF could effectively block the ROS generation in
microvascular endothelial cells. Also AGEs induce the production of
ROS, and the treatment increase the activity of the PI3K/Akt, which
results in the increase of permeability of the endothelial cells.AGE-
BSA activates PI3K, which triggers multiple signaling pathways, one
of which leads to ROS production. Previously a feed-forward loop

has been suggested for the enhancement in the synthesis of ROS
which involves the ROS that may promote the activity of PI3K,
followed by Akt and NADPH oxidase, which results in the increase
in the production of ROS [59]. Thus, the presence of 2 feed-forward
loops (PI3-kinase → NADPH oxidase → p22phox → Akt and PI3
Kinase → Akt) favor ROS production which may in turn activates
endothelial cell permeability (Fig. 13).

In the regulation of paracellular permeability, tight junctions are
known to play a major role in the regulation of paracellular
permeability. Indeed, tight junctions comprise an essential structural
component of the blood-brain barrier and growth factor
induced alterations in tight junctions are thought to contribute to
permeability in a variety of disease states [60]. ZO-1 is a member of
the membrane-associated guanylate kinases which contains three
PDZ domains, one Src homology 3 (SH3) domain, a domain
homologous to yeast guanylate kinase as well as a large C-terminal
domain that binds actin filaments and it is also the first identified TJ
protein [61,62]. ZO-1 is found to play an important role in the
localization of occludin by interacting with it. Besides, ZO-1 also
plays an important role in maintaining vascular permeability.
Moreover, some of the recent reports show that disruption and
phosphorylation of ZO-1 between the endothelial cells mediate the
vascular leak induced by VPF/VEGF [63,64]. VEGF reduces occludin
content in retinal endothelial cells and VEGF regulation of occludin
is thought to play an important role in promoting retinal vascular
permeability in diabetes [13]. Therefore, we examined the effect of
AGE-BSA and PEDF on ZO-1 in retinal endothelial cells. Consistent,
with previous reports, AGEs treatment reduced ZO-1 expression in
retinal endothelial cells. PEDF, on the other hand, counteracted the
reduction of ZO-1 expression by AGE-BSA suggesting that tight

Downstream of PI3K activation, both NADPH-induced ROS and Akt are transiently activated.

junction regulation by PEDF may play a role in its anti-permeability effects.

# 5. Conclusion

In conclusion, our present study illustrates that PEDF exhibit the anti-permeability effects by counteracting the biological effects of AGEs. Disruption of PI3K/Akt signaling by pharmacologic blockade or by PEDF approaches abrogated this AGE-BSA-induced permeability. Further, PEDF reduces the AGE-BSA-induced ROS generation via suppressing the NADPH oxidase activity and it increases the tight junction protein expression in retinal endothelial cells. Taken together, our findings further support the argument on PEDF possessing therapeutic anti-permeability properties in addition to its anti-angiogenic properties. This constellation of effects indicates that PEDF may be an attractive therapy for various conditions characterized by excessive vasopermeability. A better understanding of the biology and mechanism of action of PEDF may reveal a novel and more effective therapeutic approach to the treatment of the AGE-induced pathogenesis involved in diabetic conditions.
