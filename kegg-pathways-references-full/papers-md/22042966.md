In Journal of Clinical Oncology (JCO), two groups of investigators provide important evidence for the critical role of MET in malignant transformation. Graziano et al¹ report a dose-proportional risk of recurrence and decreased survival associated with increasing MET gene copy number in stages II to III gastric adenocarcinoma. Lennerz et al² show that MET amplification in gastroesophageal carcinomas is uncommon, observed in only 2% of their patient cohort. However, an increase in MET gene copy number was associated with higher presenting tumor stage and grade as well as shorter median survival. These two reports add to a growing body of evidence that MET is a key driver of oncogenic transformation in a defined subset of cancers. This Understanding the Pathway article will provide an overview of the MET signaling pathway, discuss the role of MET in malignancy, and consider the potential for targeting MET in cancer therapy.

MET is an integral plasma membrane protein that relays signals from the extracellular environment into the cytoplasm (Fig 1). MET is activated when its extracellular domain binds to hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), also known as scatter factor. This protein is primarily expressed on epithelial cells, whereas HGF is secreted by mesenchymal cells and bound in an inactive form to heparin proteoglycans within the extracellular matrix. The HGF polypeptide is inactive in its initial form and must be cleaved into a disulfide-linked α-β heterodimer by an extracellular protease—HGF activator—to acquire MET-binding activity. HGF activator is a serine protease that is produced in the liver but localized and activated selectively at sites of tissue injury and in cancer. The mesenchymal-epithelial communication mediated by HGF-MET signaling is critical to the formation of three-dimensional body structures (morphogenesis) through cellular behaviors collectively described as invasive growth: proliferation and survival (resistance to apoptotic signals), increased cell motility, cell dissociation (scattering), epithelial tubulogenesis, infiltration of tissues, and stimulation of angiogenesis.³ These MET-dependent behaviors are essential for normal processes such as embryogenesis, organ regeneration, and wound healing. Cancers with increased MET activity commandeer this machinery to facilitate tumor growth and invasion/metastasis.

The cascade of molecular events triggered by HGF begins with MET kinase activation within the receptor’s cytoplasmic tail. Two tyrosine residues within the kinase domain undergo trans-autophosphorylation to create a fully activated enzyme. Two additional tyrosine residues are subsequently phosphorylated, resulting

Fig 1. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)/MET signaling pathway transduces invasive growth signals from mesenchymal to epithelial cells. HGF precursor secreted by mesenchymal cells is activated by HGFA and binds to MET receptor on epithelial cells. MET kinase activation results in trans-autophosphorylation and binding of adaptor proteins such as growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (GRB2) and GRB2-associated binding protein 2 (GAB2), which form scaffolds for recruitment and activation of signaling proteins. Signals generated from these assembled structures lead to changes in gene expression and cell behavior, with increased proliferation, survival, motility, invasiveness, and stimulation of angiogenesis. Amplification or activation of MET can result in transformation, and inhibitors of MET pathway components are being developed as cancer therapies.

in a high-affinity binding motif that recruits a range of Src homology 2 domain-containing proteins, which include nonenzymatic adaptor proteins such as growth factor receptor–bound protein 2 (GRB2) and GRB2-associated binding protein 1. GRB2 and GRB2-associated binding protein 1 is phosphorylated by MET and cooperates with GRB2 and other adaptors to serve as a scaffold for additional signaling proteins, including phosphoinositide 3-kinase, phospholipaseC-γ1, STAT3, focal adhesion kinase (involved in motility), and the tyrosine

phosphatase SHIP-2 (mediates formation of branched tubules). These and other conserved signaling components are activated by MET, including mitogen-activated protein kinase, p38, JNK, and nuclear factor κB.4 Activation of these signals leads to changes in transcription of various cellular genes as well as other cellular changes that result in invasive growth potential.

The role of MET in cancer was first noted in 1984, when it was cloned as a fusion oncogene from a human osteosarcoma cell line.5 MET is a proto-oncogene, meaning that regulated expression of the wild-type allele plays a role in normal physiologic processes, and malignant transformation occurs when MET activity is increased inappropriately and/or constitutively activated. Genetic evidence that MET plays a causative role in cancer is provided by the development of papillary renal carcinoma in families who carry autosomal dominant missense mutations in the tyrosine kinase–encoding sequences of MET.6 These mutations lead to ligand-independent kinase activity and are also observed in sporadic papillary renal cell carcinoma, childhood hepatocellular carcinomas, gastric carcinomas, and head and neck squamous carcinomas. Somatic amplification of the MET gene has also been described and linked to adverse outcomes in a subset of gastroesophageal tumors, as reported by Lennerz et al2 and Graziano et al1 in JCO and has been previously observed in gastric, ovarian, and non–small-cell lung cancers. Other mechanisms of increased MET activity in cancers include ligand-independent activation by extracellular matrix proteins, autocrine overexpression of HGF ligand, and increased expression of HGF activator.

The key role that MET plays in malignant transformation suggests that inhibition of MET signaling may abrogate growth and progression of cancers in which its activity is increased. ATP-competitive and allosteric inhibitors of MET kinase as well as neutralizing antibodies against MET and HGF have shown promising clinical activity.7-9 In JCO, Lennerz et al2 report tumor responses in two patients with MET-amplified gastroesophageal carcinoma who were treated with crizotinib, an ATP-competitive inhibitor of MET kinase activity. Unfortunately, these responses were short lived, suggesting acquired tumor resistance. Resistance to MET kinase inhibitors can be acquired through upregulation of alternative signaling components (HGFα–epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), human epidermal growth factor receptor, K-Ras) that converge on shared downstream machinery such as the phosphoinositide-3 kinase–AKT and mitogen-activated protein kinase systems.10-12 Conversely, amplification of MET has been observed to be a mechanism of acquired resistance to EGFR inhibitors.13,14 These data suggest that blockade of serial steps in signaling pathways (vertical blockade) and/or blockade of parallel signaling pathways (horizontal blockade) may be necessary for optimal targeted therapy of solid tumors. The potential benefits of parallel blockade were illustrated recently by the broad antitumor activity of cabozantinib, the dual MET/vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitor, even in tumor types in which oncogenic activation of MET is uncommon.9 Taken together, the available clinical and preclinical data establish a central role for MET in oncogenic transformation of a subset of cancers and also suggest that MET may function in a wider spectrum of malignancies in a cooperative role with other signaling pathways.
