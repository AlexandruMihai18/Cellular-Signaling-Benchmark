## ABSTRACT

Apelin is an adipokine secreted by adipocytes. Co-expression of apelin and apelin receptor (APJ) in adipocytes implies the autocrine regulations of apelin on adipocyte functions through yet unknown molecular mechanisms. In the present study, we provide evidence that apelin, through its interaction with APJ receptor, inhibits adipogenesis of pre-adipocytes and lipolysis in mature adipocytes. The detailed molecular pathways underlying apelin signaling is proposed based on our experimental observations. Specifically, we show that apelin suppresses adipogenesis through MAPK kinase/ERK dependent pathways. And by preventing lipid droplet fragmentation, apelin inhibits basal lipolysis through AMP kinase dependent enhancement of perilipin expression and inhibits hormone-stimulated acute lipolysis through decreasing perilipin phosphorylation. Apelin induced decrease of free fatty acid release can be attributed to its dual inhibition on adipogenesis and lipolysis. This study suggests that the autocrine signaling of apelin may serve as a novel therapeutic target for obesity and other metabolic disorders.

## 1. Introduction

Apelin is a peptide hormone identified as the only endogenous ligand for the previously orphaned G protein-coupled APJ receptor (Tatemoto et al., 1998). As apelin and APJ receptor are widely expressed in various tissues and organ systems (e.g., brain, heart, stomach, pancreas, skeletal muscle and blood vessel) (Masri et al., 2005), it is not surprising that apelin is involved in many physiological functions, such as, fluid homeostasis (Galanth et al., 2012), cardiac muscle contraction (Ashley et al., 2005), vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation (Li et al., 2008), and vasodilation (Japp et al., 2008).

More recently, it has been discovered that apelin and APJ receptor are also expressed in adipocytes (Castan-Laurell et al., 2005; Wei et al., 2005). Adipocyte, which is previously regarded as the passive energy storage site, has now been increasingly recognized for its pivotal roles in metabolic homeostasis via secretion of a variety of signaling molecules called adipokines (Fruhbeck et al., 2001; Than et al., 2011a). Apelin is a relatively new addition to the adipokine family (Boucher et al., 2005). Recent studies have revealed the emerging roles of apelin in metabolism (Castan-Laurell et al., 2011). Apelin regulates feeding behavior (Valle et al., 2008; Lv et al., 2012), increases insulin sensitivity and glucose uptake (Attane et al., 2010; Yue et al., 2010), and stimulates energy expenditure (Higuchi et al., 2007; Yamamoto et al., 2011). And it is believed to link with metabolic disorders because its plasma level is elevated in type 2 diabetes and obesity (Heinonen et al., 2005; Li et al., 2006; Sorigué et al., 2009).

Co-expression of apelin and APJ receptor in adipocytes implies the autocrine regulations of apelin on adipose tissue. Indeed, it has been shown that body adiposity and serum level of triglycerides decrease in mice after injection of apelin (Higuchi et al., 2007). Also as recently reported by Yue et al. (2011), abdominal adiposity and serum level of free fatty acids (FFAs) significantly increase in apelin-null mice while apelin treatment attenuates the isoproterenol-induced FFA release from adipocytes. Likely, apelin is implicated in adipogenesis and lipolysis in adipocytes through yet unknown molecular pathways.

In the present study, we provide evidences that apelin inhibits both adipogenesis and lipolysis, and detailed molecular pathways are proposed. The mouse cell line 3T3-L1 was used because its pre-adipocytic state is a well-established *in vitro* culture model for adipocyte differentiation and its differentiated state is a widely-used *in vitro* model of mature adipocytes (Green and Kehinde, 1975; Rosen and Spiegelman, 2000; Ye et al., 2011).

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Cell culture

3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes (American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD, USA) were cultured in DMEM (Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium; Gibco, Rockville, MD, USA) containing 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated bovine calf serum (Gibco), at 37 °C and in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO₂. Two days after reaching confluence (defined as day 0), the cells were induced to differentiate by culturing in DMEM containing 10 μg/ml insulin, 1 μM dexamethasone, 0.5 mM 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco) (IDM plus FBS medium) for 2 days. On day 2, the medium was replaced with DMEM containing 10 μl insulin and 10% FBS. On day 4, the medium was changed to DMEM containing 10% FBS only, and incubation was continued for 4–5 days with the medium being refreshed every alternative day.

Adipose-derived stem cells (ADSC) were isolated from subcutaneous adipose tissue of the sprague-dawley rats as described previously ([Zuk et al., 2001](https://doi.org/10.1086/321930); [Xu et al., 2008](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.stem.2008.03.004)). Briefly, adipose tissue was washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), cut into small pieces, and digested with 0.25% collagenase. After adding basal medium (DMEM containing 10% FBS), the suspension was centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 10 min to obtain the stromal vascular fraction. After re-suspending the pellet, cellular debris was removed through 100 μm nylon mesh. After 24 h incubation of the cells in the basal medium at 37 °C, the non-adherent cells were removed by changing the medium, and the rat ADSCs were continuing maintained in basal medium till confluence. Subsequently, the stem cells were induced to differentiate into adipocytes for 10–14 days either in the presence or absence of 1 μM pyr-apelin13. As previously described ([Zuk et al., 2001](https://doi.org/10.1086/321930); [Kakudo et al., 2007](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcbp.2007.03.001)), to induce adipogenic differentiation, the ADSCs were cultured in the adipogenic medium, that is, DMEM containing 10% FBS supplemented with a hormonal cocktail (10 μg/ml insulin, 1 μM dexamethasone, 0.5 mM IBMX, and 200 μM indomethacin). The medium was refreshed every 2–3 days.

In some experiments, 1 μM dorsomorphin or 50 μM PD98059 or pyroglutamated apelin-13 (Pyr-Apelin13) of desired concentrations was continuously present during the differentiation period. These chemicals were added when the medium was refreshed every 2 days. And 30-min pre-treatment of dorsomorphin and 60-min pre-treatment of PD98059 was conducted prior to induction of differentiation. Dorsomorphin (Compound C), KT5720and PD98059 were purchased from Tocris Bioscience (Ellisville, MO, USA). Pyr-Apelin13 was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotech (Santa Cruz, CA, USA). Unless otherwise stated, all chemicals were purchased from Sigma–Aldrich (Saint Louis, MO, USA).

2.2. Transient transfection with siRNAs or expression vectors

Gene silencing of apelin or APJ receptor in 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes was achieved using a mouse apelin-siRNA (sc44742; Santa Cruz Biotech) or a mouse APLNR-siRNA (sc44733; Santa Cruz Biotech), respectively. Overexpression of apelin was realized using a mouse apelin-GFP plasmid (OriGene Technologies, Rockville, MD, USA). Control experiments were done in parallel using control siRNA (Santa Cruz Biotech) or GFP expression vector (OriGene Tech). Transfections were performed similarly as the previous reported ([Hashimoto et al., 2009](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2009.01.020)). Briefly, one day after being split, 3T3-L1 cells were incubated with OPTI-MEM (Gibco) containing a complex of Lipofectamine 2000 (0.5% v/v, Invitrogen Inc, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and siRNAs (20 nM) or a complex of Lipofectamine 2000 and expression plasmids (5 μg/ml) for 4 h. This was followed by addition of the equal volume of DMEM containing 20% (v/v) calf serum and incubation for additional 8–12 h. The cells were then cultured

in DMEM containing 10% (v/v) calf serum till confluence and differentiation was induced as described above. Overexpression of apelin or knocking down of apelin or APJ receptor expression was confirmed by immunoblot analyses.

2.3. Western blot analyses

Cells were washed twice with cold PBS and scraped in RIPA cell lysis buffer (sc-24948, Santa Cruz Biotech) containing freshly added protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma). Samples were vortexed briefly and then centrifuged for 5 min at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C. The supernatant of the sample was collected and its protein content was determined using a protein assay kit (Bio-Rad Lab, Hercules, CA, USA) based on Bradford method. Each sample with the equal amount of total proteins was separated by electrophoresis through 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was then blocked for 2–3 h at room temperature with 5% bovine serum albumin (Bio-rad) in Tris-buffered saline-Tween (TBST) buffer (10 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl and 0.05% Tween-20, pH 7.4), followed by subsequent incubation in TBST for 12 h at room temperature with anti-mouse primary antibodies (1:200–400 dilution) against PPARγ (Santa Cruz Biotech), phospho-PPARγ (Santa Cruz Biotech), C/EBPα (Santa Cruz Biotech), Wnt10b (Santa Cruz Biotech), leptin (Sigma), aP2 (adipocyte-FABP; Santa Cruz Biotech), FAS (Santa Cruz Biotech), ACC (Cell Signaling Technology Inc., Beverly, MA,USA), perilipin (Santa Cruz Biotech), phospho-perilipin (ValaScience Inc., San Diego, CA, USA), apelin (Santa Cruz Biotech), APJ receptor (Santa Cruz Biotech), pERK (Biovigion Inc., Mountain View, CA, USA), or total ERK (Biovision). After washing three times with TBST buffer, the membrane was incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Sigma; 1:5000 dilutions) for 6–8 h at room temperature. The protein bands were detected by using Opti-CN detection kit (Bio-Rad), and quantified using a Densitometer (Bio-rad).

2.4. Oil Red O staining

The lipid droplets were stained as previously described ([Ramirez-Zacarias et al., 1992](https://doi.org/10.1016/0003-2697(92)90036-8)). The 3T3-L1 adipocytes (on day 6–7) cultured in 6-well plates were washed with PBS and fixed with 10% formalin for 15 min at room temperature. The cells were then washed twice with PBS and stained for 15 min with a filtered Oil Red O staining solution(Sigma) which consists of Oil Red O (1.8 mg/ml) and isopropanol (60% v/v) in distilled water. This was followed by washing with distilled water. The staining of lipid droplets in adipocytes was observed under optical microscope. In some experiments, Oil Red O staining, eluted by 100% isopropanol, was quantified by measuring the optical absorbance of Oil Red O at 520 nm in a plate reader (Victor3; PerkinElmer, Boston, MA, USA).

2.5. Adipogenesis assay

Adipogenesis assay, which is to quantify the cellular triglyceride content, was performed using an Adipogenesis Assay kit (Biovigion) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, 3T3-L1 adipocytes (on day 6–7) cultured in 6-well plates were washed twice with PBS, scraped and homogenized, and then assayed for total triglyceride. Optical density at 570 nm was used for colorimetric assay (Victor3, PerkinElmer). The total protein concentration was used as the internal control, and measured with a protein assay kit (Bio-Rad).

2.6. Enzyme immunoassay (EIA) of apelin release

3T3-L1 cells were washed three times with PBS, and incubated in the serum-free DMEM for 6 h at 37 °C. The medium samples

with the same amount of total proteins were collected for ELA analysis using apelin C-terminus ELA kit (RayBiotech Inc., Norcross, GA, USA).

### 2.7. Cell viability and proliferation assay

The viability of cells after different treatments or transfections were determined using a MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrasodium bromide)-based cell growth determination kit (Sigma). In brief, after washing the cells with PBS, MTT reagent solution (5 mg/ml MTT in RPMI-1640 without phenol red) was added to the culture medium (10% v/v) and the cells were incubated for 4 h at 37 °C. Then, MTT solvent (0.1 N HCl in anhydrous isopropanol) was added to the culturing well (50% v/v). Finally, the absorbance at 570 nm was measured by a plate reader (Victor3).

### 2.8. Confocal microscopy

3T3-L1 adipocytes grown on the poly-L-lysine coated glass-coverslips were fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 10 min, and subsequently permeabilized with 0.1% TritonX-100 and blocked with 1.5% bovine albumin before overnight incubation with specific primary antibodies. Perilipin or apelin was immunostained first with a goat polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotech), and subsequently with a rabbit anti-goat secondary antibody conjugated with FITC (Sigma). APJ receptor was immunostained first with a rabbit polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotech), and subsequently with a goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody conjugated with Atto647 NHS (Sigma). In some experiments, adipocytes were incubated with Pyr-apelin13 and/or epinephrine for 4 h at 37 °C before fixation. After staining and subsequent washing with PBS, adipocytes were imaged using a Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope (LSM 510 Meta, Carl Zeiss GmbH, Germany).

### 2.9. Measurement of free fatty acids (FFA)

3T3-L1 adipocytes were incubated in serum-free DMEM at 37 °C, and FFA content in the medium was determined with a FFA quantification kit (Biovision) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. In some experiments, adipocytes were treated with pyr-apelin13 and/or epinephrine for 4 h before FFA measurement. Optical density at 570 nm was used for colorimetric assay (Victor3, PerkinElmer).

## 3. Results

### 3.1. Apelin suppresses the progressive expression of adipogenic transcriptional factors and prevents the regressive expression of anti-adipogenic factor during 3T3-L1 differentiation

The mouse 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes, which differentiate into mature adipocytes upon hormonal stimulation, were used as the in vitro model of adipogenesis (Green and Meuth, 1974; Mandrup and Lane, 1997; Ye et al., 2011). It is well-known that adipogenic differentiation is controlled by a set of adipogenic transcriptional factors (Farmer, 2006). Among them, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein α (C/EBPα) are known to be critical activators and commonly used as the makers of adipogenesis (Rosen et al., 2002; Lowe et al., 2011). Progressive expression of these activators occurs during adipogenesis (Gregoire et al., 1998). On the other hand, adipogenesis is also synergistically promoted by regressive expression of some anti-adipogenic factors, such as Wnt10b (Bennett et al., 2002). Hence, the expression levels of PPARγ, C/EBPα, and Wnt10b were monitored at the different stages of 3T3-L1 differentiation. As expected, the expressions of PPARγ and C/EBPα significantly increased while the expression of Wnt10b greatly declined as the 3T3-L1 cells differentiating into adipocytes (Fig. 1).

In adipocytes, preproapelin (77 amino acid long peptide) is expressed by APLN gene and cleaved into shorter active peptides including pyr-apelin13 (pyroglutamated 13 amino acid peptide fragment) (Tatemoto et al., 1998; Than et al., 2012). Note from

**Fig. 1.** During 3T3-L1 adipogenic differentiation, apelin suppresses the expression of adipogenic transcriptional factors (PPARγ and C/EBPα) and stimulates the expression of anti-adipogenic factor (Wnt10b).

The top panels show the representative immunoblots. In (A and B), the lower panels show the statistical data (mean ± SEM from 5–6 independent experiments) normalized to the expression level at day 2 without pyr-apelin13 treatment (as control). In (C), the lower panel shows the statistics (mean ± SEM from 3–4 independent experiments) normalized to the expression level at 30 min without pyr-apelin13 treatment (as control). Each sample contains the same amount of proteins (as the internal control). Student’s t-test: *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01 vs. control; #p < 0.05, ##p < 0.01 between indicated pairs.

Fig. 1A and B that application of pyr-apelin13 (referred as apelin in the following text for clarity) to the culture medium considerably suppressed the progressive expression of PPARγ and CEBPα. And- the apelin inhibition on the expression of these transcriptional factors was dose-dependent (Supplemental Fig. S1). In contrast, apelin treatment significantly prevented the regression of Wnt10b expression in the early stage of adipocyte differentiation (Fig. 1C). Given the critical importance of these factors, our experiments suggest the inhibitory regulation of apelin on adipogenesis.

### 3.2. Apelin inhibits the adipogenesis of 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes

Adipogenesis is a complex process by which fibroblast-like undifferentiated pre-adipocytes transform into morphologically rounded mature adipocytes that accumulate lipid droplets (Gregoire et al., 1998; Rosen and MacDougald, 2006). Lipid droplet accumulation, which is commonly used an indicator of the degree of adipogenesis, was visually assessed by Oil Red O staining and quantitatively analyzed by measuring intracellular triglyceride content. On day 6, most of the 3T3-L1 cells were differentiated into mature adipocytes as evidenced by their morphological change and intracellular lipid droplets stained by Oil Red O (Fig. 2A). Also

as shown in Fig. 2A, treatment of pyr-apelin13 during differentiation led to a marked decrease of Oil Red O staining (thus lipid droplet formation) in an apparently dose-dependent manner. Consistently, the intracellular triglycerides of the differentiated 3T3-L1 cells (day 6) were also significantly and dose-dependently attenuated by the apelin treatment (Fig. 2B). As shown in Fig. 2C and D, the decrease of triglycerides is linked to the decrease of lipogenesis due to apelin-inhibited expression of fatty acid synthase (FAS) and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC). As FAS and ACC are also adipogenic markers (adipogenesis is accompanied by lipogenesis), these observations further supports our hypothesis that apelin suppresses the 3T3-L1 differentiation into adipocytes.

PPARγ and C/EBPα are important early markers of adipogenesis while adipocyte protein 2 (aP2) is a late marker (Gregoire et al., 1998; Ntambi and Young-Cheul, 2000). As shown in Fig. 2E, apelin also inhibited the expression of aP2. Leptin, which is an adipocyte-specific hormone, can also serve as a specific late marker of adipogenesis (MacDougald et al., 1995; Liu et al., 2011b). Expression of leptin is not detectable in 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes. As shown in Fig. 2F, leptin expression drastically increased over time during the differentiation process, and it was largely inhibited by apelin. Taken together, the inhibitory roles of apelin on adipogenesis are

### 3.4. Apelin overexpression suppresses the adipogenesis while knocking down of apelin gene expression accelerates it

The exogenous application of apelin was found to suppress the adipogenesis (Figs. 1 and 2). To corroborate the hypothesis of autocrine inhibition of apelin on adipogenesis, we investigated the effects of apelin overexpression and siRNA knock-down of apelin expression. The overexpressed apelin molecules are tagged with green fluorescence protein (GFP) as the reporter. As expected, apelin release and expression were increased in 3T3-L1 cells overexpressed with apelin while decreased in siRNA knock-down cells (Supplemental Fig. S3). Similar to the exogenous application of apelin and as anticipated, overexpression of apelin decreased lipid droplet formation, intracellular triglyceride, expression of adipogenic transcriptional factors, and expression of leptin (Fig. 3). On the other hand, siRNA knock-down of apelin expression produced opposite effects. In control experiments, overexpression of GFP itself and transfection of control siRNA showed no appreciable effects. Furthermore, we confirmed that the observed phenomena were not because of impaired cell viability caused by exogenous apelin or plasmid transfection (Fig. 3E).

### 3.5. Apelin-suppressed 3T3-L1 adipogenesis is MAPK kinase/ERK dependent

The previous studies have suggested that apelin may stimulate AMP activated protein kinase (AMPK) in adipocytes (Dray et al., 2008; Attane et al., 2010). And studies have also shown that activation of AMPK blocks the expression of PPARγ and C/EBPα (Habinski and Witters, 2001; Dagon et al., 2006). Therefore, it is conceivable that apelin suppresses adipogenesis in AMPK dependent manner. To test this possibility, we used dorsomorphin (a potent and highly selective inhibitor of AMPK) to block the AMPK activity during 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation (Zhou et al., 2001). But as shown in Fig. 4, dorsomorphin (1 μM) did not promote adipogenesis of 3T3-L1 cells based on both the number of differentiated adipocytes (cells containing lipid droplets) and the expression levels of PPARγ and C/EBPα. And it was also not able to alleviate the inhibitory effects of apelin. Therefore, apelin-induced inhibition on adipogenesis is AMPK independent.

Several lines of evidence have shown that increased MAPK kinase/ERK activities suppress adipogenesis (Miyaoka et al., 2006; Kim et al., 2007; Rhee et al., 2008). And it has been demonstrated that apelin activates ERK phosphorylation through the G-protein coupled APJ receptors in a number of cell types (Masri et al., 2002; Bai et al., 2008). Therefore, we hypothesized that apelin inhibits adipogenesis through stimulating MAPK kinase/ERK pathway. This is indeed supported by the observations that PD98059 (50 μM), a specific inhibitor of MAPK kinase (Alessi et al., 1995), rectified the inhibitory effects of apelin on the number of lipid-droplet containing adipocytes and the expression of adipogenic transcriptional factors (Fig. 4). Note, however, that PD98059 showed no significant stimulatory effect on adipogenesis in the absence of apelin. Thus, it can be concluded that apelin induced

inhibition of adipogenesis is, at least in part, dependent on MAPK kinase/ERK signaling pathway.

### 3.6. Apelin increases ERK1/2 phosphorylation in cAMP/PKA dependent manner

To further confirm that apelin inhibits adipogenesis by stimulating MAPK kinase, we tested the effects of apelin on ERK1/2 phosphorylation in 3T3-L1 cells. Application of exogenous apelin, as expected, stimulated the ERK1/2 phosphorylation in 3T3-L1 cells from its low basal level (Fig. 5A, Supplemental Fig. S4).

As shown in Fig. 5B, the stimulation of adipogenesis by the hormone cocktail caused acute increase of ERK1/2 phosphorylation (within 15 min). But in accordance with the previous reports (Prusty et al., 2002; Bost et al., 2005), such increase is transient, i.e., the level of ERK1/2 phosphorylation restored quickly towards the low basal level in the order of a few hours even in the continuous presence of hormonal stimulation. The low basal ERK activity implies its insignificant role in adipogenesis and explains why inhibition of basal ERK activity by PD98059 had no obvious effect on adipogenesis (Fig. 4). Interestingly, the stimulated ERK1/2 phosphorylation persisted when apelin was co-applied together with the hormonal stimulation (Fig. 5B). This observation together with those in Fig. 4 implies that apelin inhibits adipogenesis by sustaining the MAPK kinase/ERK activities. As shown in Fig. 5C, apelin inhibition appears to act, at least in part, through phosphorylating (thus inactivating) the adipogenic transcriptional factor PPARγ (Hu et al., 1996; Adams et al., 1997).

In some cell types, cAMP-activating protein kinase A (PKA) inhibits MAPK kinase/ERK pathway (Dhillon et al., 2002; Davis et al., 2003). Similarly, we observed that KT5720 (1 μM), a potent and selective inhibitor of PKA (Kase et al., 1987), increased ERK phosphorylation in the 3T3-L1 cells (Fig. 5D). And it has been reported that apelin decreases cAMP accumulation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (Yue et al., 2011). Therefore, it is likely that cAMP/PKA acts the upstream of MAPK kinase/ERK. In other words, apelin may inhibit adipogenesis by reducing cAMP/PKA inhibition on ERK signaling. This is supported by the observation that co-application of forskolin (an activator of adenylatecyclase; 10 μM) abolished apelin stimulated ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. 5D). Furthermore, our conclusion that apelin inhibition is AMPK independent (Fig. 4) is corroborated by the observation that co-application of dorsomorphin did not suppress the apelin stimulated ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. 5D). Taken together, it may be proposed that apelin inhibits adipogenesis via promoting ERK1/2 activities in cAMP/PKA dependent manner which, in turn, inactivates the adipogenic transcriptional factor PPARγ.

### 3.7. Apelin increases the size of lipid droplets and perilipin expression through the AMPK dependent pathway

As seen from Fig. 4A, although exogenous apelin largely decreased the number of differentiated adipocytes, the size of the lipid droplets inside the differentiated adipocytes appeared to be enlarged. To better illustrate this phenomenon, single 3T3-L1 adipocytes with or without apelin treatment (1 μM) during differentiation are shown in Fig. 6A and the statistics on the size of lipid droplet is presented in Fig. 6B. Such phenomenon could be resulted from apelin induced inhibition of basal lipolysis. In the support of this view, the release of free fatty acids (FFA) was indeed found to be reduced by apelin (Fig. 6C). This is in line with the previously reported observation that long-term infusion of apelin reduces the serum levels of free fatty acid (FFA) and glycerol in apelin-null mice (Yue et al., 2011).

Perilipin, one of the major lipid droplet-coating proteins, is known to stabilize the lipid droplets and reduce the basal lipolysis in adipocytes (Brasaemle et al., 2000; Brasaemle, 2007). As revealed by immunostaining (Fig. 6A, bottom row), the lipid droplets inside the 3T3-L1 adipocyte was surrounded by perilipin coating, and the coating was obviously thickened by the apelin treatment during differentiation. Thus, it is likely that apelin suppresses basal lipolysis by increasing the expression of perilipin. Western immunoblotting confirmed that both application of exogenous apelin and overexpression of apelin enhanced perilipin expression (Fig. 6D). Consistently, siRNA knocking-down of apelin reduced perilipin expression. Exogenous application of low doses of apelin (10 and 100 nM), however, was not able to obviously affect perilipin expression or lipid droplet size.

As observed from Figs. 4A and 6B, C, apelin-induced enlargement of lipid droplets and reduced FFA release were eliminated by dorsomorphin, suggesting the importance of AMPK activation. In comparison, inhibition of MAPK kinase by PD98059 did not affect the apelin-induced enlargement. Western immunoblotting showed that the apelin enhanced perilipin expression was abolished by dorsomorphin, but not affected by PD98059 (Fig. 6E). Taken together, it may be concluded that apelin inhibits basal lipolysis by increasing perilipin expression through stimulation of AMPK, whereas independent of MAPK kinase/ERK pathway.

### 3.8. Apelin's inhibitory effect on adipogenesis and stimulatory effect on lipid droplet size are mediated by APJ receptor

It is likely that apelin acts through its interaction with APJ receptors expressed on adipocytes. This hypothesis is tested in a series of experiments using siRNA knock-down of APLNR gene which expresses the APJ receptor. We first confirmed that APJ receptor expression was significantly reduced in APLNR-siRNA knock-down cells (Supplemental Fig. S2A). As shown in Fig. 7, siRNA knock-down of apelin or APJ receptor expression in 3T3-L1 cells markedly increased the number of differentiated adipocytes and reduced the size of lipid droplets. Furthermore, application of exogenous apelin was able to reverse the effects of knock-down of apelin expression whereas it was not able to reverse the effects

of gene knock-down of APJ receptors. These experiments unambiguously demonstrate the critical involvement of APJ receptors.

### 3.9. Apelin ameliorates β-adrenergic agonist induced fragmentation of lipid droplets, perilipin phosphorylation, and FFA release

Lipolysis can be greatly accelerated by stimulating fragmentation of lipid droplet, which increases the surface area of lipid droplets for lipase binding (Ducharme and Bickel, 2008; Puri and Czech, 2008). β-adrenergic agonists can stimulate fragmentation and lipolysis of lipid droplet by activating cAMP/PKA pathway, which, in turn, leads to phosphorylation of perilipin and hormonal sensitive lipase (HSL) (Marcinkiewicz et al., 2006; Brasaele et al., 2009). As shown in Fig. 8A, epinephrine (a β-adrenergic agonist) indeed caused fragmentation of lipid droplets and reorganization of their perilipin coating in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Interestingly, co-application of apelin was able to protect lipid droplets (and perilipin coating) from being fragmented by epinephrine (Fig. 8A). As shown in Fig. 8B, apelin partially curbed the epinephrine stimulated perilipin phosphorylation. This can be explained by the previous observation that cAMP elevation induced by isoproterenol (a β-adrenergic agonist) can be attenuated by apelin (Yue et al., 2011). Presumably, protective effect of apelin on lipid droplets shall lead to reduced lipolysis. Indeed, it was

found that apelin suppressed the epinephrine-induced FFA release (Fig. 8C). It has been reported that apelin suppresses isoproterenol-induced lipolysis because of reduced phosphorylation of HSL by PKA (Yue et al., 2011). Our experiment here implies that the inhibition of apelin on stimulated lipolysis may be attributed in part to reduced fragmentation of lipid droplets by inhibiting phosphorylation of perilipin.

### 3.10. Apelin receptors (APJ) surround the lipid droplets

Using confocal microscopy and immunostaining, we examined the cellular localization of APJ receptors in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. As shown in Fig. 9, some APJ receptors are associated with the plasma membrane while the majority of them reside intracellularly on the peripheral of the lipid droplets. The coating of APJ receptors on

et al., 2005). We found that APJ receptors are also expressed in ADSC, suggesting the existence of apelin/APJ signaling (Supplemental Fig. S2C). As shown in Fig. 11, similar to its effects on 3T3-L1 cells, apelin also increases the size of lipid droplets in adipocytes differentiated from ADSCs and inhibits adipogenesis of ADSC as evidenced by reduced number of adipocytes and reduced expressions of leptin and aP2 (late markers of adipogenesis). Hence, the observed apelin effects are not specific only to 3T3-L1 cells.

## 4. Discussion

Adipocytes play central roles in regulating metabolic homeostasis via secretion of a variety of adipokines (Fruhbeck et al., 2001). Just like the vesicular exocytosis in other endocrine cells (Zhang et al., 2009; Than et al., 2011b), secretion of adipokines are highly regulated (Than et al., 2011a, 2012). And these adipokines regulate metabolism in peripheral tissues and influence the secretion and functions of other metabolic factors (Ouchi et al., 2011; Than et al., 2011a). Intriguingly, there are emerging evidences that adipokines exert autocrine regulation on adipocyte functions including adipogenesis, lipolysis, and secretion of other adipokines (Karastergiou and Mohamed-Ali, 2010). For examples, leptin suppresses adipogenesis (Rhee et al., 2008) while adiponectin promotes it (Fu et al., 2005); leptin induces lipolysis (Takekoshi et al., 1999) while adiponectin reduces it (Qiao et al., 2011); and leptin and resistin suppress each other’s secretion (Ye et al., 2010). In the present study, we revealed the autocrine regulations of apelin on adipogenesis and lipolysis. Our findings can be fitted into the signaling map illustrated in Fig. 12.

APJ receptors are expressed in pre-adipocytes and adipocytes (Castan-Laurell et al., 2005; Wei et al., 2005). They are believed to couple to both the heterotrimeric Gi (Masri et al., 2002; Moon et al., 2007) and Gq proteins (Szokodi et al., 2002). Upon binding of apelin molecule with APJ, the activated Gi protein inhibits adenyl cyclase which, in turn, decreases the intracellular cAMP and the activities of protein kinase A (PKA) (Moon et al., 2007; Bai et al., 2008). Suppressed PKA activities relieve their inhibition on the activation of MAPK kinase/ERK signaling (Dumaz and Marais, 2005). Subsequently, enhanced ERK1/2 phosphorylation inhibits the expression and activation of adipogenic transcriptional factors (Camp and Tafuri, 1997). In addition, stimulated Wnt signaling (Wnt10b) by apelin may also account for the inhibition of the expression of PPARγ and C/EBPα (Bennett et al., 2002). As the result of these apelin initiated signaling events, adipogenesis is inhibited. Such scenario of signal transduction is supported by our observations (Figs. 1–7) that (1) external application of apelin decreased the progressive expression of critical adipogenic transcriptional factors (PPARγ and C/EBPα), prevented the regressive expression of anti-adipogenic factor (Wnt10b), decreased the expression of adipocyte-specific markers (aP2, leptin, FAS, ACC) and the number of lipid-droplet-containing mature adipocytes; (2) overexpression of apelin exerted the similar effects as exogenous apelin whereas siRNA knock-down of apelin expression produced the opposite, implying the autocrine actions of apelin after being secreted; (3) siRNA knock-down of APJ receptor expression increased the adipogenesis and this effect could not be counteracted by exogenous apelin treatment; (4) apelin inhibition on the expression of adipogenic factors and adipogenesis was blocked by inhibiting MAPK kinase; (5) external application of apelin enhanced ERK1/2 and PPARγ phosphorylation; (6) a PKA stimulator (forskolin) suppressed apelin induced ERK phosphorylation while a PKA inhibitor (KT5720) increased ERK phosphorylation. The proposed signaling transduction is also supported by the previous findings that apelin is able to stimulate ERK phosphorylation in other cell types (Masri et al., 2002; Bai et al., 2008). And several studies have shown that

### 3.11. Apelin’s effects on adipogenesis and lipid droplet size in rat adipose-derived stem cells

Adipose-derived stem cells (ADSC), which can differentiate into adipocytes upon hormonal stimulation, have been used as the in vitro cell model for adipogenesis (Janderova et al., 2003; DeLany

sustained activation of ERK1/2 during differentiation restrains adipogenesis ([Bost et al., 2005](https://doi.org/10.1038/nm1290)), and drugs or hormones that suppress adipogenesis are also potent activator of ERK1/2 ([Miyaoka et al., 2006](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molmet.2006.03.002); [Kim et al., 2007](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molmet.2007.01.001); [Rhee et al., 2008](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molmet.2008.01.001)).

Here, for the first time, we illustrate the inhibitory regulation of apelin on adipogenesis. And it provides a possible explanation to the previous finding in mice that apelin is able to reduce the mass of white adipose tissue ([Higuchi et al., 2007](https://doi.org/10.1038/oby.2007.10)). It is likely that apelin serves as a negative feed-back control at autocrine level to restrain adipogenesis (thus increase of body adiposity), because progress of adipogenesis or increase of adipose tissue leads to increase of apelin secretion. And such feedback control is further strengthened by the increasing expression of APJ receptors during the progress of adipogenesis (Fig. 2H). Plasma level of apelin is elevated in obesity ([Heinonen et al., 2005](https://doi.org/10.1038/oby.2005.10); [Soriguer et al., 2009](https://doi.org/10.1038/oby.2009.10)). Conceivably, obesity may be resulted if the inhibitory regulation of apelin on adipogenesis is disrupted. This idea is consistent with a previous finding that the body fat mass notably increases in APKO mice (mice with generalized deficiency of apelin signaling) ([Yue et al., 2011](https://doi.org/10.1038/oby.2011.10)). Our study suggests the possibility to combat obesity by increasing apelin level or the potency of apelin signaling.

In this study, we also presented the evidences that apelin is able to inhibit lipolysis by stabilizing the lipid droplets. We observed that (1) long-term exposure of exogenous apelin stimulated the expression of lipid-droplet-coating protein (perilipin), enlarged the size of lipid droplets, and reduced the release of free fatty acids (FFA); (2) these apelin effects were blocked by inhibiting AMPK with dorsomorphin; (3) overexpression of apelin acted similarly as external application of apelin while siRNA knock-down of apelin expression acted oppositely; (4) inhibiting AMPK reduced the size of lipid droplets; (5) siRNA knock-down of APJ receptor expression markedly reduced the lipid droplet size and this effect could not be abolished by exogenous apelin treatment. Based on these results, the following transduction may be proposed. Mediated by Gq protein, apelin/APJ interaction activates AMPK; activation of AMPK stimulates the expression of perilipin; the thickened perilipin coating stabilizes the lipid droplets from fragmentation and remodeling, protects them from being attacked by lipases, and reduces FFA release.

The above picture is also supported by the previous studies. It has been shown that lipid accumulation is markedly reduced in 3T3-L1 adipocytes treated with dorsomorphin ([Suenaga et al., 2010](https://doi.org/10.1038/oby.2010.10)) and, in the mice lacking the predominant α subunit of AMPK, basal lipolysis is considerably increased and the size of adipocytes is reduced ([Daval et al., 2005](https://doi.org/10.1038/oby.2005.10)). Perilipin is known to regulate the activity of adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), the rate-limiting enzyme for triglyceride hydrolysis ([Zimmermann et al., 2004](https://doi.org/10.1038/oby.2004.10); [Wang et al., 2011](https://doi.org/10.1038/oby.2011.10)). Under basal condition, perilipin binds the ATGL co-activator (CGI-58) to prevent its interaction with ATGL, and consequently inhibits the lipolysis ([Granneman et al., 2009](https://doi.org/10.1038/oby.2009.10)). Mutations in perilipin have been recently shown to increase lipolysis because of failing to sequester the interaction between ATGL and CGI-58 ([Gandotra et al., 2011](https://doi.org/10.1038/oby.2011.10)). It has been shown in perilipin null mice that basal lipolysis is elevated and the size of adipocytes is smaller ([Martinez-Botas et al., 2000](https://doi.org/10.1038/oby.2000.10); [Tansey et al., 2001](https://doi.org/10.1038/oby.2001.10)). And a number of studies have demonstrated that increase (decrease) of perilipin via overexpression (gene knock-down) or hormonal/chemical stimulation (inhibition) results in reduced (increased) lipolysis and increased (reduced) lipid droplet size ([Souza et al., 1998](https://doi.org/10.1038/oby.1998.10); [Tansey et al., 2004](https://doi.org/10.1038/oby.2004.10); [Sawada et al., 2010](https://doi.org/10.1038/oby.2010.10); [Liu et al., 2011a](https://doi.org/10.1038/oby.2011.10)).

β-adrenergic agonists are major lipolytic hormones in the body ([Arner, 1999](https://doi.org/10.1038/oby.1999.10)). They activate PKA which, in turn, phosphorylates the hormone-sensitive lipases (HSLs) to facilitate their association with lipid droplets ([Krintel et al., 2008](https://doi.org/10.1038/oby.2008.10); [Wang et al., 2009](https://doi.org/10.1038/oby.2009.10)). PKA also

phosphorylates perilipin molecules to cause their dissociation from lipid droplets, leading to fragmentation and lipid droplets and thus increased surface area for HSL association (Marcinkiewicz et al., 2006; Granneman et al., 2007). In a previous study, apelin inhibition on hormone-stimulated lipolysis was attributed to the reduction of HSL phosphorylation (Yue et al., 2011). Our experiments here suggest that this can also be attributed to prevention of hormone-stimulated fragmentation of lipid droplets (Fig. 8). As seen from Fig. 8C, acute apelin treatment in differentiated adipocytes has no effect on fatty acid release. Taken together the results demonstrated in Figs. 6 and 8, it appears that apelin inhibition on lipolysis is twofold. Long-term exposure of apelin inhibits basal lipolysis through AMP kinase dependent enhancement of perilipin expression while apelin inhibits hormone-stimulated acute lipolysis through preventing phosphorylation of perilipin and HSL.

Apelin inhibition on lipolysis may also be assisted by the direct interaction of APJ receptors with lipid droplets. We observed that APJ receptors, just like other lipid-droplet coating proteins (perilipin, adipophilin) (Blanchette-Mackie et al., 1995; Brasaemle, 2007), densely surround lipid droplets and reorganize upon hormone stimulated droplet fragmentation (Fig. 9). And co-localization of apelin and APJ receptors was observed on the peripheral of lipid droplets after external application of apelin (Fig. 10) suggesting the internalization of apelin/APJ receptor complex onto lipid droplets and their direct functions on fragmentation and/or lipolysis. The specific actions on APJ receptors on lipid droplets require further investigations. Taken together, we provide evidences to show that apelin/APJ receptor may regulate lipolysis through three distinct routes.

It has been demonstrated that apelin reduces plasma level of free fatty acids (FFA) and release of FFA from adipocytes (Xu et al., 2011; Yue et al., 2011). Our study provides molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon. Specifically, this can be attributed to apelin inhibition on both adipogenesis and lipolysis. It is well known that high FFA level can lead to insulin resistance in peripheral tissues (Boden, 1999, 2001). The present study implies that secretion of apelin and autocrine signaling of apelin in adipocytes may serve as novel therapeutic targets for metabolic disorders, particularly, obesity induced type 2 diabetes.
