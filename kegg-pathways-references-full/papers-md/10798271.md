### Endothelfunktion und Hämostase

Summary The vascular endothelium influences not only the three classically interacting components of hemostasis: the vessel, the blood platelets and the clotting and fibrinolytic systems of plasma, but also the natural sequelae: inflammation and tissue repair. Two principal modes of endothelial behaviour may be differentiated, best defined as an anti- and a prothrombotic state. Under physiological conditions endothelium mediates vascular dilatation (formation of NO, PGI₂, adenosine, hyperpolarising factor), prevents platelet adhesion and activation (production of adenosine, NO and PGI₂, removal of ADP), blocks thrombin formation (tissue factor pathway inhibitor, activation of protein C via thrombomodulin, activation of antithrombin III) and mitigates fibrin deposition (t- and urokinase plasminogen activator production). Adhesion and transmigration of inflammatory leukocytes are attenuated, e.g. by NO and IL-10, and oxygen radicals are efficiently scavenged (urate, NO, glutathione, SOD). When the endothelium is physically disrupted or functionally perturbed by postischemic reperfusion, acute and chronic inflammation, atherosclerosis, diabetes and chronic arterial hypertension, then completely opposing actions pertain. This prothrombotic, proinflammatory state is characterised by vasoconstriction, platelet and leukocyte activation and adhesion (externalisation, expression and upregulation of von Willebrand factor, platelet activating factor, P-selectin, ICAM-1, IL-8, MCP-1, TNFα, etc.), promotion of thrombin formation, coagulation and fibrin deposition at the vascular wall (expression of tissue factor, PAI-1, phosphatidyl serine, etc.) and, in platelet-leukocyte coaggregates, additional inflammatory interactions via attachment of platelet CD40-ligand to endothelial, monocyte and B-cell CD40. Since thrombin formation and inflammatory stimulation set the stage for later tissue repair, complete abolition of such endothelial responses cannot be the goal of clinical interventions aimed at limiting procoagulatory, prothrombotic actions of a dysfunctional vascular endothelium.

### General considerations

Classical primary and secondary hemostasis only comprised the sequential formation of the white and red thrombus, but there is growing awareness that hemostasis is intimately coupled to fibrinolytic processes, inflammatory reactions as well as to initiation of angiogenesis and wound healing. Basically, three components need to interact to assure effective primary and secondary hemostasis together with the normal sequelae, fibrinolysis and tissue repair:

- the vascular wall (smooth muscle, matrix and connective tissue, endothelial cells),

count for numerous pathophysiological disturbances of primary and secondary hemostasis, fibrinolysis and tissue repair. Accordingly, it has become justified and meaningful to distinguish between a physiological and a perturbed endothelium (for reviews, see 1, 6, 10, 18, 19).

As schematically outlined in Fig. 1, under normal conditions the vascular endothelium supports vasodilation, inhibits adhesion and activation of blood platelets, suppresses the plasma coagulation cascade while enhancing fibrin cleavage, and antagonizes those inflammatory processes relying on activation and adhesion of blood leukocytes. In other words, such a physiological endothelium tends to be antithrombotic and antiinflammatory in character. The simplest way to emphasize its importance is to consider the host of problems encountered with any form of extracorporeal circulation.

In complete contrast to the physiologic state, endothelial perturbation, be it physical or functional, leads to a preponderance of vasoconstrictory mechanisms and the vascular wall assumes a prothrombotic, procoagulatory and proinflammatory character. The latter alterations include phenomena such as enhanced vascular permeability, production of chemokines, cytokines, and growth factors, as well as increased expression of leukocyte and platelet adhesion molecules. However, some of these changes in phenotype are essential for adequate immune response, wound healing and tissue repair, and a delicate balance exists for other actions. It is, thus, exceedingly difficult to draw the line between "positive" and "negative" properties of the endothelium. This insight has an immediate consequence for many of the therapeutic procedures aimed at the endothelium and presently being developed to control hemostasis: Instead of being able to generalize, one will be forced to consider the role of the vascular endothelium in a time and situation-dependent manner before drawing conclusions as to its physiological or pathophysiological state of function. In the following, several intriguing aspects of the complex interaction between endothelium, on the one hand, and hemostatic, fibrinolytic and inflammatory mechanisms, on the other hand, shall be illustrated.

Fig. 1 Scheme of the role played by the vascular endothelium in hemostasis. Two states of interaction can be differentiated: endothelium with an antithrombotic and a prothrombotic nature. In the former, the endothelium supports vasodilation, inhibits adhesion and aggregation of blood platelets, inhibits the plasma coagulation cascade, supports fibrinolysis and suppresses adhesion and activation of leukocyte/platelet coaggregates. Dysfunctional endothelium enhances vasoconstriction, platelet activation and adhesion, thrombin formation, fibrin deposition, and supports leukocyte adhesion and inflammation. However, platelet/leukocyte attraction may prove essential for tissue repair. FVa activated coagulation factor V, IL interleukin, NO nitric oxide, PAI-1 plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, PGI₂ prostacyclin, TF tissue factor, TFPI tissue factor pathway inhibitor, TM thrombomodulin, tPA tissue-type plasminogen activator, uPA urokinase-type plasminogen activator

- formed elements of the blood (platelets, granulocytes, monocytes, lymphocytes), and
- the plasmatic clotting and fibrinolytic systems.

The vascular endothelium enacts the role of mediator between these participants for both, anatomical and functional reasons. Scientific development over the last 10 years indicates that the properties of the endothelium may even govern the physiological balance of hemostasis/fibrinolysis and that endothelial derangement can ac-

Importance of the endothelium for the control of vascular tone

The proper, direct response of an acutely injured vessel to reduce loss of blood is to constrict. In such a scenario, mechanical or physical (heat, radiation) damage of the endothelium is fortuitous, because then production of endothelial dilating agents (adenosine, nitric oxide, prostacyclin, hyperpolarizing factor) and, thus, endothelium-mediated dilatory responses (e.g., to shear stress, adenine nucleotides, serotonin) are diminished (3, 12,

19). Furthermore, eliminating the physical and (sometimes) metabolic barrier posed by the endothelium for substances such as ADP, serotonin and thromboxane enables these to act directly on the vascular smooth muscle cells, i.e. to elicit constriction (19, 21).

On the other hand, chronic endothelial dysfunction in the absence of direct damage to the vessel wall, a state encountered in hypertonic, atherosclerotic, diabetic, postischemic or inflamed vascular beds, will enhance the tendency toward vasospasm and oedema formation, and facilitate access of growth factors and stimulants (thrombin, endothelin, interleukins) to the cells of the vessel wall. Moreover, increases in shear stress have been found to induce promitogenic and proinflammatory responses in endothelial cells (43). Hence, loss of dilatory capacity of perturbed endothelium could initiate a vicious circle. Reduced supply of antioxidants from the perturbed endothelial cells (NO, uric acid, glutathione) will enhance oxidative stress (2, 4, 5, 34, 52), and may even promote formation of oxidized low density lipoprotein within the vascular wall. Accordingly, acute and chronic endothelial damage may give rise to two very distinct functional consequences.

Coronary artery vasomotor tone distal to an existing thrombotic site is enhanced due to endothelial dysfunction (54). According to animal experiments, the endothelial disturbance derives from P-selectin mediated adhesion of leukocytes, presumably elicited, in turn, by thrombin or reactive oxygen species released from the upstream thrombus (17). Our own studies indicate that also adenosine, released from damaged tissue and thrombotic material, provokes downstream adhesion of PMN by stimulating endothelial adenosine A1-receptors (7, 42, 51). Because such mechanisms would serve to propagate endothelial dysfunction, implications will be discussed further below.

### The blood platelet component of haemostasis

Under physiological conditions, the endothelium is characteristically antiadhesive and antiaggregatory in its interaction with blood platelets. In fact, the production of adenosine, NO and PGI₂ by intact endothelial cells and the relative paucity of adhesion sites together account almost entirely for the normal “disinterest” of thrombocytes for the vessel wall and explain why the size of the platelet aggregate – the white thrombus of primary haemostasis – is limited to the site of an endothelial lesion (7, 20, 21, 46).

As shown in Fig. 2, absence or perturbation of the endothelial lining dramatically alters the interaction between vessel wall and thrombocytes. Now, nothing opposes the plethora of platelet stimulating agents (ADP, thrombin, thromboxane, PAF, oxidized LDL, adrenaline,

serotonin, collagen, etc.) and the bared subendothelial matrix presents sites for both low- and high-shear stress adhesion of platelets (von Willebrand Factor, collagens, laminin, vitronectin, fibronectin, thrombospondin) (50). Oxidatively perturbed endothelial cells produce PAF (mainly membrane bound), isoprostanes, and – especially if apoptotic – support thrombin formation directly at the cell surface (10, 32). The latter occurs because the annexin-V ligand phosphatidylserine, externalised to the outer membrane leaflet, acts as a phospholipid component of the prothrombinase complex (10, 18). Externalisation of vWF from the Weibel-Palade bodies and PE-

CAM-1 (CD31) may also support adhesion of activated platelets to activated endothelial cells (36, 44, 45, 47).

We have recently found that thrombin-induced adhesion of blood platelets in the intact coronary bed under low-flow conditions aggravates postischemic reperfusion damage of the heart (7, 23, 24, 46). Surprisingly, this platelet effect occurred without formation of intravascular microthrombi and did not depend on the generation of thromboxane. However, the compound SQ29,548, an antagonist of isoprostane action, prevented cardiodepression, as did the GPIIb/IIIa-blocker lamifiban. The difference between the two agents was that only lamifiban mitigated platelet adhesion (23, 24). Although the exact mechanism by which platelets induce contractile dysfunction in reperfused hearts remains to be elucidated, intravascular adhesion of the thrombocytes was an absolute requirement and this, in turn, came about after stimulation of both platelets and the endothelial cells.

It should be borne in mind that antibodies such as Abciximab, by binding to the platelet adhesion molecule CD41 (GPIIb/IIIa), can act as platelet activating agents although they may mitigate direct adhesion and aggregation. Their success in therapy, e.g. after stent implantation, relies on the – generally unstated – fact that other platelet inhibitory drugs, foremost aspirin, are always concomitantly given (1, 28, 33). Platelet activation via CD41 seems to be absent for “fiban”-type drugs, small molecular non-peptide blockers of the RGD-binding site of GPIIb/IIIa. However, the substance lamifiban mimicked the vascular sealing effect of fibrinogen in the intact coronary system of isolated perfused guinea pig hearts, suggesting that there may be some mimetic actions at other integrin sites in the vascular bed (24).

### Local regulation of coagulation and fibrinolysis by the endothelium

Coagulation and fibrinolysis are the two components of haemostasis upon which the endothelium exerts the most complex influence. Over the last 20 years tremendous insight has been gained concerning the basically anti-coagulatory and pro-fibrinolytic nature of the normal vascular endothelial lining as opposed to the pro-coagulatory, fibrin-retentive character of a perturbed endothelium (for reviews, see 10, 18, 19).

Four main mechanisms contribute to the inhibition of fibrin deposition on a physiological endothelial lining:

- Heparan- and dermatan-sulfate groups of the glycosaminoglycan (activation of heparin cofactor II and AT III)
- Thrombomodulin-dependent activation of the protein C/protein S system (destruction of activated coagulation factors V and VIII)

- Expression of tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI induced block of coagulation via both the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways)
- Preponderance of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and urokinase (scuPA) activity (plasmin-mediated fibrinolysis)

Especially the discovery of the activated protein C (APC) pathway has furthered understanding of several pathological phenomena, such as hemorrhagic necrosis following cumarol application and thrombosis resulting from factor V resistance to APC (18). Indeed, the relative frequency of APC resistance in the general population is estimated to lie between 2–10% (8). The application of recombinant tPA and uPA to enforce thrombolysis is a clinically well-established procedure. New approaches to inhibiting thrombin formation may perhaps evolve from the now successful production of recombinant human APC and TFPI (1, 10). It should be noted that heparin causes release of TFPI from the endothelial surface, an action which enhances TFPI efficacy and contributes to the antithrombotic effect of heparin (10, 31). Failure of heparin to release enough TFPI or subsequent binding of TFPI to excessive plasma lipoproteins – which reduces the amount of free, active TFPI – may account for the failure of heparin to inhibit thrombosis in some cases (31). Pertinently, TFPI k.o. mice die in utero, emphasizing the critical role of this antithrombotic endothelial mechanism. Mice deleted in tPA and uPA, in contrast, evidence good viability.

Perturbed endothelium shows a complete change of face. Thrombomodulin (TM) is down-regulated, and shedding of TM has even been employed as a measure of endothelial damage (9). In response to inflammatory mediators (IFNγ, TNFα, IL-1, LPS, VEGF), endothelial cells have been found to express tissue factor (TF) and coagulation factor V, localising the formation of thrombin and, hence, of fibrin to the endothelial surface (10, 41, 48). In addition, the activity of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) increases, in part due to the loss of the APC. This synergistically enhances fibrin deposition. Besides such changes in endothelial surface character, the induction of acute and chronic changes in paraendothelial permeability, e.g. by VEGF, NO, thrombin, inflammatory cytokines, diabetes or atherosclerosis, will facilitate passage of coagulation factors from plasma to the abluminal tissue. In view of the high tissue factor activity residing in practically all vessel walls and interstitial compartments, this influx will lead to substantial production of thrombin.

The formation of thrombin at the endothelial surface and within the vessel wall is, in itself, a major pro-thrombotic and pro-inflammatory event (see also below). Thrombin must be regarded as a pleotropic agent, since, besides cleaving fibrinogen and supporting positive feedback to the formation of prothrombinase, this

protease activates membrane receptors (Protease-Activated Receptors-1, -3 and -4) on a variety of cells, foremost platelets, monocytes, vascular smooth muscle cells and the endothelial cells themselves (15). Activation of these PARs enhances endothelial dysfunction and induces mitogenic responses. For instance, endothelial cells rapidly externalize PAF, P-selectin, vWF and interleukin-8 and monocyte chemotactic peptides (MCP) in response to thrombin (27, 32, 45, 49). Thus, inhibition of thrombin formation by any means whatsoever should be of greater long-term benefit than mere thrombolysis. Interestingly, also other activated factors of the coagulation cascade, namely TF/VIIa and Xa, may induce cellular Ca²⁺ oscillations via PARs, perhaps giving rise to inflammatory and mitogenic changes in the vascular wall beyond those due to thrombin (13, 40).

recently been found to express TF on the membrane surface (22). Platelets contribute Factor V, the chemottractants β-thromboglobulin and platelet factor 4, in addition to Ca²⁺, fibrinogen and phospholipid.

The presence of platelets on PMN and monocytes in normal human arterial and venous blood, as documented by flow cytometry and direct microscopic visualisation, demonstrates the occurrence of platelet-leukocyte microaggregates in whole blood (53). The number of such coaggregates emerging from the human heart in vivo with the coronary venous blood is practically identical to the number entering with the arterial blood (35, 53). Normally, therefore, coaggregates do not adhere to an intact endothelium. Following CABG, however, there is net sequestration of platelet-monocyte, platelet-PMN coaggregates in the coronary system during early reperfusion. Such an effect will undoubtedly set the stage for an inflammatory component (35, 53).

Under physiological conditions, endothelial cells produce NO and IL-10, both of which tend to inhibit adhesion and activation of leukocytes (5, 30). Adenosine at micromolar concentrations has a similar effect (7, 16, 39). Upon stimulation of the endothelial cells, P-selectin and vWF are rapidly externalised to promote rolling of leukocytes and platelets. With somewhat greater delay, E-selectin is also produced. Sticking to constitutively expressed ICAM-1 is enhanced by contact of leukocyte and platelet PAF receptor to PAF and PAF-related substances in the membrane of endothelial cells stimulated by thrombin, inflammatory agents (IL-1, LPS, TNFα, IFNγ) or redox stress.

**The inflammatory component of hemostasis**

Arterial thrombi contain not only fibrin, platelets and trapped red blood cells. Leukocytes, mainly polymorphonuclear granulocytes and monocytes, but also some lymphocytes, are also present, already in the very early white thrombus (7, 25). This is more than coincidental. In fact, coaggregates of leukocytes and platelets are readily formed, particularly via fibrinogen-bridging between GPIIb/IIIa on platelets and Mac-1 on leukocytes, and can localise the coagulation cascade to this site (Fig. 3). Besides the binding of fibrinogen and Factor X to the adhesion molecule CD11b/CD18, native polymorphonuclear neutrophilic granulocytes (PMN) have

released from activated endothelial cells also attract and activate leukocytes. Acute thrombolysis/reperfusion after myocardial infarction leads to release of interleukins-6 and -8 (37). Coronary and pulmonary vascular release of IL-6 and IL-8 has been observed in early post-ischemic reperfusion of patients subjected to coronary bypass operation (CABG) (14, 35, 53). Such enhancements of cytokine and interkrine levels can lead to recruitment and activation of leukocytes at the vascular wall, precipitating the above-mentioned, localized formation of thrombin and fibrin (38). Surprisingly, APC may contribute to endothelial interleukin production (26).

Cardiac release of another inflammatory cytokine, tumor necrosis factor (TNFα), was also observed in the first minutes of reperfusion for the human heart and in experimental models (29, 35). This may be pertinent for determining sub-acute reperfusion damage: In isolated hearts of rats and guinea pigs the release of TNFα caused NFκB-dependent upregulation of endothelial ICAM-1. After 4–8 hours, the number of PMN adhering to the coronary endothelium of such hearts upon a renewed ischemic challenge increased dramatically. Treatment with either an antibody against the CD18-subunit of Mac-1, a metalloprotease-inhibitor of TNFα cleavage enzyme (TACE), or a decoy oligonucleotide of the NFκB-binding sequence, all prevented enhanced leukocyte adhesion. At present, it is impossible to say whether subacute upregulation of leukocyte adhesion following coronary occlusion and reperfusion enhances the potential for damage and later reocclusion, or helps in tissue repair. The drastically deleterious result of totally subduing inflammation in hearts after infarction should be recalled (11).

Quite recently, the presence of platelets and lymphocytes in the thrombus has been causally linked to the rapid initiation of lymphocyte-mediated immune responses at the site of thrombosis (25). Platelets also express the CD40-ligand (CD154), originally only surmised on T-lymphocytes, and the vascular endothelium possesses CD40 on the membrane, as do monocytes and B-cells (Fig. 4). Interaction between CD40 and CD154 activates B-lymphocytes to produce immunoglobulins, elicits chemotaxis, activation and expression of tissue factor by monocytes, and, in the case of endothelial cells, may support activation or, perhaps, trigger apoptosis, as sometimes occurs with T-cells. Whether joining of endothelial CD40 and CD40-ligand of platelets may directly contribute to rolling or adhesion of thrombocytes remains speculative.

### Conclusions

There is no doubt that endothelial dysfunction in relation to hemostasis needs to be adequately treated. However, local procoagulatory and proadhesive reactions of the endothelium are quite essential for normal responses to infection and wound healing. Furthermore, the complexity of the interactions would seem to preclude elaboration of any simple therapeutic approach which could be extended to a wide range of situations. Particular attention will have to be paid to differences in behavior of endothelium in various segments of the vascular bed. For instance, protein C and TFPI are localized more in microvascular (capillary) sections; fibrinolysis seems to be critical in venous zones, and adhesion molecules for platelets and leukocytes also show variation.

ing prevalence. Though the still existing deficit of knowledge in the field adds to the dilemma, we have come a long way.
