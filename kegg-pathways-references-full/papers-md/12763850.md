**ABSTRACT:** The Na,K-ATPase is composed of two subunits, α and β, and each subunit consists of multiple isoforms. In the case of α, four isoforms, α1, α2, α3, and α4 are present in mammalian cells. The distribution of these isoforms is tissue- and developmental-specific, suggesting that they may play specific roles, either during development or coupled to specific physiological processes. In order to understand the functional properties of each of these isoforms, we are using gene targeting, where animals are produced lacking either one copy or both copies of the corresponding gene or have a modified gene. To date, we have produced animals lacking the α1 and α2 isoform genes. Animals lacking both copies of the α1 isoform gene are not viable, while animals lacking both copies of the α2 isoform gene make it to birth, but are either born dead or die very soon after. In the case of animals lacking one copy of the α1 or α2 isoform gene, the animals survive and appear healthy. Heart and EDL muscle from animals lacking one copy of the α2 isoform exhibit an increase in force of contraction, while there is reduced force of contraction in both muscles from animals lacking one copy of the α1 isoform gene. These studies indicate that the α1 and α2 isoforms carry out different physiological roles. The α2 isoform appears to be involved in regulating Ca²⁺ transients involved in muscle contraction, while the α1 isoform probably plays a more generalized role. While we have not yet knocked out the α3 or α4 isoform genes, studies to date indicate that the α4 isoform is necessary to maintain sperm motility. It is thus possible that the α2, α3, and α4 isoforms are involved in specialized functions of various tissues, helping to explain their tissue- and developmental-specific regulation.

INTRODUCTION

Na,K-ATPase transports $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ out of the cell and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ in, using ATP as the energy source. The resulting gradient drives many transport processes through cotransporters and produces the electrogenic potential for nerve transmission and muscle contraction. The Na,K-ATPase is composed of two subunits, $\alpha$ and $\beta$, and in some tissues the enzyme is associated with another protein, $\gamma$. ${ }^{1-4}$ Four isoforms of the $\alpha$ subunit occur in mammals, $\alpha 1$, $\alpha 2$, $\alpha 3$, and $\alpha 4$, and three isoforms of the $\beta$ subunit have been identified, $\beta 1$, $\beta 2$, and $\beta 3$. The $\alpha$ isoforms are expressed in a tissue-specific and developmentally regulated manner. ${ }^{5}$ The $\alpha 1$ isoform is expressed in every tissue, while the $\alpha 2$ isoform is limited largely to skeletal muscle, heart, and brain. The $\alpha 3$ isoform is expressed in brain and ovary, while the $\alpha 4$ isoform is expressed exclusively in sperm and its precursor cells. ${ }^{6}$ The $\alpha 2$ isoform appears around birth in heart and skeletal muscle, but both the $\alpha 2$ and $\alpha 3$ isoforms are expressed earlier in brain development. The isoforms exhibit somewhat different properties in terms of cation binding, but it is unknown whether these differences are significant in terms of their overall physiological function.

In an attempt to understand the differential roles of the $\alpha$ isoforms, we have initiated a gene-targeting approach, where animals are produced lacking either one or both copies of the $\alpha 1$ or $\alpha 2$ isoform genes. ${ }^{7}$ These animals provide the opportunity to examine Na,K-ATPase function with either reduced amounts or the absence of these two isoforms.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Our approach for understanding the specific functional role of each of the $\alpha$ isoforms has employed gene-targeting studies. So far, this technology has been used to produce animals lacking either one copy or both copies of the $\alpha 1$ and $\alpha 2$ isoform genes in mice. In both cases, homologous recombination was used to both introduce a selectable marker and delete specific regions of the Na,K-ATPase required for function. Embryonic stem cells were generated carrying these modifications and these cells introduced into blastocysts of mice, which produced chimeric animals composed of cells originating from both wild type and targeted cells. Upon mating, some animals passed the modified genes through their germ cells, providing a permanent mouse line with the targeted allele carried in the genome. Mating animals with the disrupted $\alpha 1$ or $\alpha 2$ isoform on one chromosome allowed mice to be produced where the disruption occurred in both copies of the $\alpha 1$ or $\alpha 2$ isoform genes.

Animals lacking the $\alpha 1$ isoform gene do not produce offspring, and preliminary studies indicate that they do not develop past the blastocyst stage. This is not unexpected, as the $\alpha 1$ isoform is found in every tissue, and it is not unreasonable to think that as soon as the maternal Na,K-ATPase disappears the blastocyst will no longer survive. The $\alpha 2$ isoform, however, is not expressed during very early embryonic development, at least in the tissues studied to date, so it was expected that these animals would survive longer than the $\alpha 1$ isoform-deficient animals. Interestingly the $\alpha 2$ isoform-deficient animals developed to term but were either born dead, or died within the first few minutes following birth. There were no gross abnormalities associated with these animals, and histological studies revealed no differences

between animals lacking the α2 isoform gene and wild type animals, with the exception of the lung, which did not appear to be fully inflated following birth. The α2 isoform was just beginning to be expressed in heart and skeletal muscle but was expressed at nearly maximal levels in the diaphragm muscle. Also, the α2 isoform was expressed in the brain at birth at levels 50–75% of those in the adult brain. It is possible that the animals could not breathe, due to a defect in either the ability of the diaphragm to contract or because of a lack of signal from the brain.

The animals lacking only one copy of either the α1 or α2 isoform gene are viable, mate, and produce healthy offspring. These animals thus provide a unique opportunity for studying the differential function of the α1 and α2 isoforms, as they produce approximately one-half the amount of α1 or α2 isoform protein, respectively. We have examined the function of two tissues, cardiac<sup>7</sup> and skeletal muscle,<sup>8</sup> in the animals lacking one copy of the α1 and α2 genes. Hearts from animals lacking one copy of the α2 isoform are hypercontractile, as would be expected based on studies of cardiac glycoside inhibition of the Na,K-ATPase. In this case, inhibition of the Na,K-ATPase causes an increase in force of contraction of the heart through the accumulation of intracellular Na<sup>+</sup>, which increases intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> through the Na-Ca exchanger. The higher intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels results in larger Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients, which in turn increases the force of contraction. However, when the contraction of the heart from animals lacking one copy of the α1 isoform gene is examined, an opposite phenotype is observed, that is, the hearts exhibit a hypocontractile phenotype. This is unexpected as it would have been assumed that partial loss of either the α1 or α2 isoform would cause an ionotropic effect similar to inhibition of the Na,K-ATPase with cardiac glycosides. It is unknown why inhibition of the α1 isoform causes the heart to be hypocontractile, but we have ruled out Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload as being responsible for this activity by varying extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> in working heart preparations.

We have also examined the contractile properties of the extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle<sup>8</sup> in animals lacking one copy of either the α1 or α2 isoform gene. Similar to the heart, loss of one gene for either the α1 or α2 isoform gene reduces the levels of α1 and α2 isoform proteins by approximately half compared to wild type levels. EDL from animals lacking one copy of the α2 isoform gene exhibits an increase in the force of contraction, while those lacking one copy of the α1 isoform gene show a reduced force of contraction similar to the heart. This is true with both tetanic and twitch contractions. Relaxation is unaffected, which indicates that the difference in phenotype is not due to a defect in Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake following contraction.

In the case of heart muscle, approximately 80% of the α subunit is the α1 isoform, with 20% being the α2 isoform. This is reversed in EDL muscle, approximately 80% being α2 isoform and 20% the α1 isoform. Therefore, the differences in contractile properties do not appear to be related to the ratio of α1 or α2 isoform found in the tissue. The finding that two muscles, which vary in their amounts of α1 and α2 isoform, show a similar alteration in contraction suggests that a functional difference in the α1 and α2 isoforms represent a general phenomenon.

There are several explanations for these findings. First, the differences may result from the different kinetic properties between the two isoforms. It is also possible that the α1 and α2 isoforms are coupled to different biological processes in the cell. For example, it has been demonstrated that the α1 and α2 isoforms are differentially localized within the cell.<sup>9,10</sup> The α1 isoform appears to be uniformly distributed in

the plasma membrane, while the α2 isoform is limited to more specific areas in the plasma membrane, namely to regions overlying the endoplasmic reticulum. Also, the α2 isoform is enriched in t-tubules in skeletal muscle compared to the α1 isoform.¹¹ The Na–Ca exchanger also appears to colocalize in regions of the plasma membrane where the α2 isoform appears.¹² Therefore, it is possible that the α2 Na,K-ATPase and the Na–Ca exchanger are located in a region of the plasma membrane that regulates localized Ca²⁺ levels near the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Thus transient Ca²⁺ levels would be largely regulated by the α2 isoform of the Na,K-ATPase, while the α1 isoform of the Na,K-ATPase would carry out more generalized Na⁺ and K⁺ transport. A diagram showing this is presented in FIGURE 1. Additional studies are required to determine whether this model is correct.

The α4 isoform is found exclusively in testis and is present in mature sperm and their precursor cells.¹³,¹⁴ While we have not developed mice lacking the α4 isoform, this isoform can be selectively inhibited in sperm because of its high affinity for ouabain compared to the low affinity of the α1 isoform, the only other isoform present. Ouabain at concentrations affecting only the α4 isoform completely inhibits sperm motility. We have further shown that the addition of nigericin, an H⁺/K⁺ ionophore, and monensin, an H⁺/Na⁺ ionophore, reinitiates ouabain-inhibited motility.¹⁵ The K⁺ ionophore, valinomycin, has no effect on the motility of ouabain-inhibited sperm. These inhibition studies suggest that H⁺ transport is involved and that the α4 isoform

may be necessary for the removal of intracellular H⁺ from the sperm. It is known that sperm motility is highly sensitive to pH, and if hydrogen ions are allowed to accumulate, sperm motility is decreased. It is possible that the α4 isoform of the Na,K-ATPase drives the removal of H⁺ from sperm through a Na/H exchanger. Both Na/H exchanger 1 and Na/H exchanger 5 are localized within the midregion of the sperm tail where the α4 isoform is also located. These studies, along with those above, may indicate that the α2, α3, and α4 isoforms function in a specialized role, possibly coupled with other ion exchangers, while the α1 isoform plays a more general transport function.

In addition to deleting genes, gene targeting can be used to produce animals where a gene has been modified in a particular way. To this end, we are developing mice that exhibit ouabain-resistant α2 and α3 isoforms. This will allow us to selectively inhibit the remaining isoform. In addition, these animals are likely to be useful in evaluating the role of endogenous ouabain. For example, if mice are produced with a low-affinity ouabain α2 isoform, then endogenous ouabain is unlikely to exhibit inhibitory activity on this isoform. If the resulting animals are compromised in some way, this will suggest than an endogenous ouabain may be responsible for the observed defect. On the other hand, if the animals are normal, the studies may suggest endogenous ouabain does not play an important role in regulating the α2 isoform of the Na,K-ATPase. This work is in progress.

**SUMMARY**

Using gene targeting, we have developed animals lacking either both copies or one copy of the α1 or α2 isoform of the Na,K-ATPase. The α1 isoform is required for animals to develop beyond the blastocyst stage, while animals lacking the α2 isoform develop to term, but are either born dead or die immediately after birth. Animals lacking one copy of the α1 or α2 isoform show different skeletal muscle and cardiac contraction phenotypes. With both tissues, reduction of one-half of the amount of α2 isoform results in an increased force of contraction, while a decreased force of contraction is observed in animals lacking one-half the α1 isoform. These studies indicate that these two isoforms play different functional roles, and it is possible that the α2 isoform is intimately involved in regulating Ca²⁺ levels related to muscle contraction, while the α1 isoform plays a more general transport role. The α4 isoform of the Na,K-ATPase is found exclusively in sperm and its precursor cells and is required for sperm motility. It is hypothesized that the Na,K-ATPase carrying the α4 isoform is responsible for removing H⁺ from sperm. It is known that sperm are highly sensitive to intracellular pH, and it is possible that this isoform is coupled to the Na/H exchanger to carry out this function.
