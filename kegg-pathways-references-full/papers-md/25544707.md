## Abstract  
The human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is a major player in the survival and proliferation of tumour cells and is overexpressed in up to 30 % of breast cancer cases. A considerable amount of work has been undertaken to unravel the activity and function of HER2 to try and develop effective therapies that impede its action in HER2-positive breast tumours. Research has focused on exploring the HER2 activated phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT and rat sarcoma/mitogen-activated protein kinase (RAS/MAPK) pathways for therapies. Despite the advances, cases of drug resistance and recurrence of disease still remain a challenge to overcome. An important aspect for drug resistance is the complexity of the HER2 signaling network. This includes the crosstalk between HER2 and hormone receptors; its function as a transcription factor; the regulation of HER2 by protein-tyrosine phosphatases and a complex network of positive and negative feedback-loops. This review summarises the current knowledge of many different HER2 interactions to illustrate the complexity of the HER2 network from the transcription of HER2 to the effect of its downstream targets. Exploring the novel avenues of the HER2 signaling could yield a better understanding of treatment resistance and give rise to developing new and more effective therapies.

## The Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2)

HER2 has been shown to play a major role in the formation and progression of different kinds of tumours, but is mostly associated with breast cancer [reviewed in [1]]. Approximately 20 to 30 % of primary human breast cancers are considered to be HER2 positive, due to overexpression and/or gene amplification of the *HER2* gene [2, 3]. HER2 is a member of the erythoblastosis oncogene B (ErbB) receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) family. The 185 kDa protein is also referred to as Neu or ErbB2. Other members of this family are epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR, ErbB1), HER3 (ErbB3) and HER4 (ErbB4).

RTK signaling is induced by homo- or heterodimerization after ligand binding. Traditionally, HER2 is considered to be an orphan receptor, but shows a continuously active conformation. Therefore, HER2 signaling is generally activated after heterodimerisation with ligand-bound EGFR, HER3 or HER4 receptors [4]. Additionally, the high receptor concentration on the membranes of HER2-overexpressing cells can lead to ligand-independent homodimerization, activation of the kinase domain and the HER2 signaling pathway [5]. As HER2 signaling activates the phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT and the rat sarcoma/rat fibrosarcoma/mitogen-activated protein kinase (RAS/RAF/MAPK) pathways, it initiates cell proliferation, growth and survival as well as invasion and angiogenesis [1, 6, 7].

In most cases HER2 signaling is induced by heterodimers with other RTKs, therefore the HER2 pathway cannot always be clearly distinguished from EGFR, HER3 or HER4-initiated pathways. In recent years studies have also demonstrated non-canonical interaction of HER2 with Mucin 1 and Leptin Receptor [8–10]. In addition, crosstalk with other hormone receptors such as estrogen receptor (ER) [11–13] and androgen receptor (AR) [14, 15] has been observed and found to be

relevant in resistance to therapy in breast cancer. Another area of research has highlighted the importance of HER2 as a transcription factor [16, 17].

From Gene to Protein

HER2 can be regulated at the gene, RNA and protein levels (Fig. 1). Although overexpression is often due to gene

amplification [2, 3] there are many other ways HER2 can be up- or down-regulated or its function changed, all of which will impact on subsequent signaling events.

The transcription of the HER2 gene which is located on chromosome 17q12-21 is regulated by a number of transcription factors (summarised in Table 1). There are various positive regulators of HER2 transcription these include: activator protein-2 (AP-2), which has shown to only induce the

Fig. 1 Regulation of HER2. Transcription of HER2 depends on different activators and repressors of transcription. HER2 pre-mRNA can be spliced into different mRNAs to generate three known variants of HER2, Δ16HER2, Herstatin and p100 [25, 26]. Translation of HER2 can be inhibited by miRNA binding which induces degradation [34]. Translation of HER2 can be influenced by alternative translation initiation, which results in two distinct HER2 variants; membrane bound 611-CTF and cytoplasmic 687-CTF [38]. Additionally, the HER2 protein can undergo proteolytic cleavage to produced 648-CTF [26]

expression of HER2 in breast cancer cells [18, 19]; transcription factor EGR2/Krox20 and its co-activator CITED1, which bind to the HER2 promoter and activate its expression in the absence of 14-3-3σ tumor suppressor [20] and signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3), which itself is a target of HER2 signaling [21].

The most prominent negative regulator of HER2 expression is the Myc promoter-binding protein-1 (MBP-1), which can act as a transcription repressor of c-Myc and COX2 genes [22]. The same study observed the subsequent recruitment of histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) and histone H4 deacetylation, which further represses transcription [22]. This finding is supported by previous work showing an inverse correlation between MBP-1 and HER2 levels in human primary ductal carcinoma and normal tissue [23]. Another repressor is Foxp3, which is mutated in some breast tumours [24].

The next level of regulation of HER2 occurs through the processing of HER2 pre-mRNA (Fig. 1). Firstly, alternative splicing of the HER2 transcript results in functionally distinct splice variants [reviewed in: [25, 26]]. Known splice variants include the membrane bound Δ16HER2 and two secreted proteins termed Herstatin and p100 [27, 28, 26]. Only a few studies have investigated the function of HER2 splice variants on the HER2 signaling network and their potential effect in breast tumour biology. The secreted proteins have been associated with better prognosis as they dimerise with wildtype HER2 or Δ16HER2 without initiating a signaling cascade [27, 29]. In comparison, Δ16HER2 has been shown to strongly dimerise and initiate signaling [30]. This variant has been associated with locally disseminated node-positive breast cancer [31]. Additionally, therapy with the monoclonal antibody trastuzumab has been shown to be ineffective as the loss of exon 16 also causes the loss of the epitope [32, 31].

The stability of HER2 mRNA can be maintained by proteins such as HDAC6 in the human breast cancer cell line,

Co-Receptors of HER2

The ErbB Family

Traditionally HER2 has been considered an orphan receptor, which is activated by hetero-dimerisation with activated co-receptors. The primary co-receptors of HER2 are the other members of the ErbB family - EGFR, HER3 and HER4 [4]. EGFR and HER4 contain functional ligand binding sites and tyrosine kinase domains. In contrast the tyrosine kinase domain of HER3 is functionally impaired. Therefore, although the receptor becomes activated by ligand binding, hetero-dimerisation with a different family member is required to initiate the signaling cascade [reviewed in [44]].

The ErbB family of receptors bind to a variety of different ligands (summarised in Table 2), some of which bind to multiple receptors like Heregulin, whereas others bind specifically to a single receptor such as epidermal growth factor (EGF) to EGFR. The precursors of these ligands are membrane-bound and their extracellular domains proteolytically cleaved by members of the ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloprotease) protein family [45]; the most prominent members being ADAM10 and ADAM17 [46]. Some ligands are associated with specific downstream responses, for example, binding of EGF promotes cell proliferation [44], and Betacellulin stimulates cell growth and differentiation [47, 48] [reviewed in [44]].

A recent study proposed that prolidase, also known as peptidase D, may serve as a ligand for HER2; using immunoprecipitation revealed that prolidase preferentially binds to pre-existing HER2 homodimers and disrupts the association of Src with HER2, thereby inhibiting the downstream signaling. In cells expressing HER2 at a low level HER2 monomers are bound by prolidase initiating dimerisation and normal downstream signaling [49].

Within the ErbB family, EGFR has the most complex role in cell signaling. EGFR has been linked to focal adhesion kinase (FAK) via SRC-3Δ4 in an integrin-dependent

adhesion and migration signaling pathway [50, 51] as well as a MEK/ERK/CDK5-mediated integrin independent signaling pathway which contributes to microtubule depolymerisation and mitosis [52]. A direct substrate of EGFR is the signal transducer and activator of transcription-5 (STAT5), which is involved in proliferation, survival and migration of cancer cells [reviewed in [53]]. Furthermore, the EGFR-HER2 heterodimer induced PI3K/PIP3 mediated translocation of phospholipase C (PLC)-γ1 to the plasma membrane and initiates reorganisation of actin and thereby regulates migration [54]. This is supported by the observation that HER2 overexpression changes the pattern of phosphorylation between HER2 and EGFR leading to phosphorylation of docking sites of Gab adapter proteins and PLCγ; the change in phosphorylation status may increase receptor stability and induce anchorage-independent growth and tumorigenesis [55].

Leptin Receptors (Ob-R)

The receptor of leptin (Ob-R), a fat cell-derived peptide hormone, was first shown to indirectly phosphorylate HER2 via JAK2 and thereby initiate the RAS signalling pathway in human embryonic kidney HEK 293T cells [9]. Phosphorylation of HER-2 and increased proliferation in response to leptin was also observed in the human breast cancer cell line SKBR-3. By using specific inhibitors of EGFR (AG1478) and JAK2 (AG490) it was shown that EGFR, and to a lesser extent JAK2, play a role in the leptin-dependent phosphorylation of HER2. A HER2-specific inhibitor (AG825) abolishes the initiation of the RAS/MAPK pathway under leptin stimulus [56]. Similar observations were made in the human breast cancer cell line, MCF-7. Although most studies indicate that it is an indirect phosphorylation via JAK2, one study has shown co-immunoprecipitation of Ob-R with HER2, indicating that there may be a more direct mechanism of activation [57].

Mucin 1 (MUC1)

Another HER2 co-receptor is MUC1, a heterodimer made up of an extracellular N-terminal and a membrane-bound C-terminal subunit (Fig. 2). Muc1 is overexpressed in breast as well as other types of cancer [58, 59] [reviewed in [8]]. The MUC1-C-terminal subunit (MUC1-C) interacts with EGFR, HER2 and other receptor tyrosine kinases [reviewed in [8]]. An increased complex formation of MUC1 with HER2 has been shown to be induced by heregulin and leads to the translocation of MUC1-C together with γ-catenin to the nucleus (Fig. 2) [60]. Therefore, it is not surprising that overexpression of HER2 in breast tumour samples is associated with an increase in nuclear MUC1 and γ-catenin levels [60]. Nuclear MUC1-C has also been linked to the co-regulation of

Adapted from Li et al. 2003 [60]

WNT target genes which are involved in the regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition [61–63]. An example is cyclin D1, a positive regulator of the cell cycle progression from G1 to S phase and a transcription regulator of nuclear receptor family genes and genes involved in de novo lipogenesis [61, 64].

Signal Activation

Activation of the two main HER2 signaling pathways: RAS/MAPK and the PI3K/AKT are initiated by the dimerisation of RTKs. The close proximity of the receptors activates the tyrosine kinases and induces phosphorylation of the C-terminal tyrosines. Numerous phosphorylation sites exist within the cytoplasmic domain of HER2, these are essential for protein: protein interactions and induction of the signaling cascades (Fig. 3). The most commonly studied phosphorylation sites are tyrosines 1139, 1222 and 1248, these are involved in the activation of the RAS/MAPK pathway as well as Tyr1196 which is needed for initiation of the PI3K/AKT pathway [Reviewed in [65]]. It is interesting to note, that the phosphorylation status of HER2, including newly found phosphorylation sites, changes in response to treatment with the anti-HER2 drug lapatinib [66].

The RAS-MAPK Pathway

One of the most important pathways activated by HER2 signaling is the RAS-MAPK pathway (Fig. 4); this pathway

has been linked to many conditions including breast cancer, as it regulates cell growth, survival, proliferation and migration [reviewed in [67, 68]]. The first step in the pathway involves docking proteins such as growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (GRB2) binding to the newly phosphorylated C-terminus of HER2. The adaptor protein son of sevenless (SOS) is activated by binding to GRB2. SOS can then cause the exchange of guanosine diphosphate (GDP) to guanosine triphosphate (GTP) on RAS. Activated RAS then initiates the activation of a kinase cascade culminating in the phosphorylation and activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1, ERK2) [reviewed in [69, 10]].

Activated ERK proteins are able to phosphorylate a number of transcription factors such as erythroleukemia virus E26 oncogene homolog 1 like gene 1 (Elk-1) [70], c-Fos and c-Jun [71], as well as MAPK-interacting serine/threonine kinase (MNK) [72] and p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) [73]. These transcription factors regulate the expression of genes involved in cell growth, differentiation, proliferation, survival,

Fig. 4 The Ras-MAPK and PI3K-AKT signaling pathways. HER dimerisation and transphosphorylation initiates the Ras-MAPK and PI3K-AKT pathways. The adaptor proteins SHC, SOS and GRB2 bind to HER2 initiating a signaling cascade via Ras, Raf and MEK to ERK1/2. ERK itself can negatively regulate Raf and SOS [76, 77]. ERK induces transcription factors involved in cell growth, proliferation, survival, proteolytic activity and transcript-turnover [69, 10, 74, 75]. Additionally, ERK can initiate cell growth via the activation of E2F1 and 3 which inhibit Rb [78–80]. The PI3K-AKT pathway is also initiated by the trans-phosphorylation of HER2. The recruitment of p85 releases p110 to recruit PI3K heterodimer to its substrate PIP₂, this is phosphorylated into PIP₃ [84, 10, 67]. Negative regulators are PTEN and INPP4B. PIP₃ causes the translocalisation of AKT to the plasma membrane where it is phosphorylated by PDK1 and mTORC2 [67]. AKT regulates proteins involved in cell survival by inhibiting pro-apoptotic pathways through inactivation of pro-apoptotic proteins like Bad [87] or of transcription factors of pro-apoptotic proteins such as FOXO3a [88] or migration as well as transcript turnover and proteolytic activity [reviewed in [69, 10, 74, 75]].

by activating survival pathways like NF-kB [89]. The tumour suppressor p53 can be inhibited by Mdm2 through AKT [90]. Further, inhibition of FOXO1 causes inhibition of FasL, an increase in survivin and thereby cell survival [94]. Additionally, AKT inhibits TSC2 and TSC1 which in turn inhibits activation of mTORC1. Active mTORC1 results in phosphorylation of S6K and 4E-BP1. S6K can in turn negatively regulate AKT [97, 10]. S6K initiates cell growth, proliferation and survival [99], and eIF4E is important for protein synthesis [98]. Phosphorylation and inhibition of FOXO1 by AKT causes the inhibition of p27 and the increase of cyclin D1 which leads to increased proliferation [91]. Similarly, deactivation of GSK3 causes β-catenin to act as a co-transcription factor of c-myc and cyclin D1 [100]. In addition, another target of AKT, HSF1 positively regulates heat-shock chaperones, which are essential for protein stability. HSP90 stabilises MIF which is involved in cell survival [103]. Additionally, HSF-1 acts as the transcription factor of Slug, which is involved in invasion and EMT [101]

The ERK proteins can initiate a negative feedback loop by phosphorylating SOS and thereby inhibit the interaction of
SOS with GRB2, this leads to a decreased activation of RAS. ERK also phosphorylates and inhibits RAF and in so doing negatively regulates activation of MEK [76, 77].

An extension of the RAS-MAPK pathway is via a link to the retinoblastoma (Rb) – E2F pathway. Rb is a well-described tumour suppressor that interacts with E2F family members and mediates E2F-dependent transcriptional activation or repression [78]. RAS signaling leads to the activation of a complex of cyclins and cyclin dependent kinases (CDKs), they in turn lead to the release of E2F transcription factors from Rb [79]. The mammalian family of E2F transcription factors consists of 8 genes encoding for 9 proteins; the $E2f3$ locus encoding for E2F3a and E2F3b proteins [80]. E2F1, E2F2 and E2F3a primarily activate genes needed for the entry into S phase [81], and appear to be required for tumour initiation and/or progression (Wu et al., 2013), as the loss of the three E2Fs prevents Myc and RAS induced cellular transformation [82]. In the case of HER2 triggered tumorigenesis E2F3, and to leaser extend E2F1, seem to be downstream effectors of HER2 signaling. It could not be determined in this study if this effect is dependent on E2F3a or E2F3b [80].

### The PI3K-AKT Pathway

The second major pathway that is activated by HER2 is the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway which has itself become a target for therapy in cancer, due to its role in cell growth, survival, proliferation as well as protein synthesis, invasive properties and drug resistance [reviewed in [83, 68]]. Similarly to the RAS/MAPK pathway the PI3K/AKT pathway is induced by dimerisation of the two RTKs and the subsequent phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain (Fig. 4). Recruitment of p85 to the phosphotyrosine residue frees p110 to recruit PI3K heterodimer to its substrate phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate ($\mathrm{PIP}_{2}$) at the cell membrane [84]. PI3K heterodimers then phosphorylate $\mathrm{PIP}_{2}$ into phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate ($\mathrm{PIP}_{3}$) [reviewed in [10, 67]]. Negative regulators of this interaction are the phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) [reviewed in [85]] and inositol polyphosphate 4-phosphatase type II (INPP4B) which de-phosphorylates $\mathrm{PIP}_{3}$ to $\mathrm{PIP}_{2}$ and then to PIP [reviewed in [83]]. $\mathrm{PIP}_{3}$ causes translocalisation of AKT to the plasma membrane where AKT is phosphorylated by 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 2 (mTORC2) [reviewed in [67]].

#### AKT

AKT is the central protein in the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway controlling a number of signal cascades promoting cell survival, growth and proliferation, as well as regulating cell cycle, glucose metabolism, protein synthesis and contributing to invasion [10]. The $AKT$ gene family contains three isoforms, AKT1, AKT2 and AKT3 [reviewed in [86]]. A recent study shows a complex interaction of AKT variants with HER2 and ER in breast cancer [12]. HER2+ cells show an increase of AKT1 and 3, but not AKT2. Knockdown of AKT1 or AKT3 reduces cell proliferation. AKT3 was hardly detectable in human ER+ breast tumours, whilst in HER2+ and triple negative breast tumours AKT3 was highly active [12]. Interestingly, this study also showed that, after depletion of AKT1 and AKT2, phosphorylation of HER2 and HER3 increases. In contrast, depletion of AKT3 decreased protein expression of HER2 and HER3 as well as tyrosine phosphorylation. This function is likely to be post-transcriptional, as the HER2 mRNA levels were not affected. Furthermore, knockdown of AKT3 leads to downregulation of the HER2 target FOXM1, whereas knockdown of AKT2 up-regulates FOXM1 [12]. These findings indicate that it might be fitting to use AKT3 as a marker of HER2 specific initiation of the PI3K/AKT pathway.

#### Cell Survival

The most prominent function of the PI3K/AKT pathway is the regulation of proteins involved in cell survival. This occurs by a number of mechanisms including the inhibition of pro-apoptotic pathways through phosphorylation such as inactivation of pro-apoptotic proteins like B cell leukemia 2 antagonist of cell death (Bad) [87] and transcription factors of pro-apoptotic proteins such as forkhead box O3a (FOXO3a) [88]. Another mechanism involves the activation of survival pathways including NF-kB signaling through via phosphorylation of its positive regulator—IkB kinase (IKK) [89]. Furthermore, the tumour suppressor p53 can be inhibited by phosphorylation and activation of its antagonist mouse double minute 2 (Mdm2) through AKT [90].

Additionally, phosphorylation and inhibition of FOXO1 by AKT has been correlated with a good prognosis in breast cancer and inversely to the expression of HER2 [91, 92]. Inhibition of FOXO1 can decrease transcription of FasL [93] and increase transcription of survivin and in so doing inhibit apoptosis [94]. Survivin is also stabilised by phosphorylation through the HER2/PI3K/ AKT signaling pathway [95].

#### Cell Cycle Progression and Proliferation

In addition to the aforementioned cell survival pathways, other cellular processes such as proliferation and control of the cell cycle are also regulated by the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. AKT is able to inactivate tuberous sclerosis 2 (TSC2) and inhibit its interaction with TSC1 which then inhibits activation of mTORC1. Active mTORC1 results in phosphorylation of p70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 and 2 (S6K1, 2) as well as the eIF4E binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) [96]. S6K can consecutively negatively regulate AKT andmTORC [97, 10]. S6K1 has been linked to mRNA translation initiation and control as well as cell growth and proliferation [reviewed in [98]], whereas S6K2 has been shown to be essential in cell survival [99]. The 4E-BP1 bound eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) is released after phosphorylation of 4E-BP1; it is then incorporated into the translational machinery [reviewed in [98]].

The cell cycle is also regulated by AKT targets. Phosphorylation and inhibition of FOXO1 by AKT leads to a decrease in p27 and an increase in cyclin D1 which leads to increased proliferation in breast cancer cell lines [91]. Similarly, phosphorylation and deactivation of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3) causes dephosphorylation and stabilization of β-catenin, which is subsequently translocated to the nucleus where it acts as a co-transcription factor of c-myc and cyclin D1 [reviewed in [100]].

### Heat-Shock Factor 1 (HSF1)

Understanding the mechanisms underlying metastasis has become an important focus in cancer research. HER2 has been linked to invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition via HSF1 [101, 102, 89]. Clinical data also indicates a relevance of HSF1 to the aggressiveness and drug resistance of a number of human cancers [5]. Furthermore, HSF1 is a positive “master regulator” of the heat-shock chaperones HSP90α, HSP70, HSP27 and a number of other chaperons and adaptor proteins. A large number of HSP chaperons are essential for cancer cells to stabilise cellular proteins, including oncoproteins, since the tumour environment and the aberrant intracellular conditions of cancer cells cause a high load of stress to the tumour cells [reviewed in [103]]. It has been shown that Heregulin β1, as a ligand of a HER2/HER3 or HER4 heterodimer, induces an increased expression of HSF1 in cells not overexpressing HER2 (Fig. 4) [104]. In HER2 overexpressing cells the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway activates HSF1 by phosphorylating Ser326 [5]. The down-regulation of the HER2 signaling pathway can lead to the inhibition of HSP90, which causes its target proteins e.g. AKT, mutant p53, macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) and HSF1 itself, to become unstable and in so doing inhibit tumour proliferation [5]. Moreover, MIF promotes breast cancer progression and reduced overall survival in a transgenic mouse model of human HER2 breast cancer [105].

Importantly, HSF-1 acts as the transcription factor of Slug, a transcriptional repressor of E-cadherin [101]. The loss of E-cadherin is considered a hallmark in EMT as it causes changes in the adhesive properties of cells and is associated with an increase in invasiveness and metastatic potential [reviewed in [106, 102]]. Additionally, HSF1 has also been indicated to influence the expression of

genes involved in the cell cycle regulation, signaling, metabolism, adhesion and translation [107].

### Crosstalk Between HER2 and Other Receptors

#### Estrogen Receptor (ER)

The estrogen receptor, ER, is expressed in up to 60% of human breast tumours [108]. Although a lower percentage of breast tumours are characterised by the expression of both HER2 and ER [109], generally an inverse correlation between HER2 and ER is observed [110]. The two estrogen receptors ERα and ERβ, are nuclear receptors and ligand-activated transcription factors [111, 109]. ERα has been shown to induce proliferation and survival of breast cancer cells [11], whereas ERβ has been implied to antagonise these functions [112, 13]. It has been shown that the HER2 pathway is connected to ER (Fig. 5). Initiation of HER2 signaling activates the RAS/MAPK pathway, as discussed; p38 MAPK is phosphorylated and thereby inhibits ERβ and its function as a transcription factor [108]. In vitro cell culture studies show that activation of MAPK by HER2 or EGFR signaling represses expression of ERα [113, 114]. A further connection between the hormone receptors is that after activation of the HER2/PI3K signaling pathway FoxO3a is phosphorylated by AKT and is thereby inactivated and exported

Fig. 5 Hormone receptor crosstalk between HER2 and ER. ERβ is inhibited by HER2 via the Ras/p38MAPK pathway [108] and ERα [113, 114]. ERα can also be down-regulated via PI3K/AKT mediated inactivation of FoxO3a [12]. In turn, ERα can activate HER2 as well as down-regulate the expression of ErbB family proteins [11]
from the nucleus. ERα gene expression can be directly induced by FoxO3a. Additionally, knockdown experiments show that depletion of AKT3 induces the protein expression of ERα [12].

After ligand binding, ERα can activate ErbB family proteins directly or indirectly or it can down regulate the expression of the RTKs [reviewed in [11]]. These interactions indicate a possible reason for mono-therapy resistance, by cells switching from HER2+/ER- to HER-/ER+ [11].

### Androgen Receptor (AR)

In a subgroup of molecular apocrine (ER-/AR+) breast cancer cell lines with HER2 overexpression, a cross-regulation of steroid-response genes has been implied. The treatment with heregulin not only induces expression of HER2, but also androgen receptor (AR) target genes. Similarly, testosterone does not only induce the expression of AR but also HER2 target genes [15]. AR has been shown to transiently phosphorylate ERK1/2 and thereby initiate a signaling cascade which induces cell growth and survival. Moreover, inhibition of HER2 by antagonists causes the persistent phosphorylation of ERK thereby inhibiting downstream signaling and cell proliferation [15]. In turn, AR is positively regulated by a feedback loop via ERK and CREB1. AR has also been shown to act as transcription factor inducing HER2 expression [14]. It is interesting to note that a study indicated that HER2+ breast cancer patients have a better prognosis if they are also AR and ER positive; giving HER+/ER-/AR- patients the poorest prognosis [115].

### Insulin-like Growth Factor-I Receptor (IGF-IR)

The first associations between insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR) and cancer were made more than 20 years ago. IGF-IR is overexpressed in up to 87% of human breast tumours [116]. Different studies have indicated IGF-IR to have a stimulating effect on cell growth, invasion and metastasis [reviewed in [117]]. More recently, crosstalk between HER2 and IGF-IR has been observed, which appears to mediate drug resistance. Independently of HER2, IGF-IR is able to activate the PI3K/AKT pathway and induce cell proliferation [118]. It was observed that targeting either receptor can lead to increased activation of the other receptor [119]. The heterodimerisation of IGF-IR with HER2 alone [120] or of IGF-IR with both HER2 and HER3 in a single complex [121] has been observed in breast cancer cell lines which are resistant to trastuzumab. Another layer of complexity is implied by a study by Worthington et al., where it was observed that HER2 down-regulates IGF binding protein-3, which subsequently increases secretion of IGF-1 and thereby the induction of the IGF-IR signaling pathway [122].

### Other Players in the HER2 Signaling Network

#### Protein-Tyrosine Phosphatase (PTPs)

The family of protein-tyrosine phosphatases contains more than 100 proteins [123]. Members of this protein family positively and negatively affect the phosphorylation of RTKs in cancer. The PTPs; PTPRO, PTPN9, PTPN11, PTPN12, PTPN13 and PTPN18 have been shown to negatively regulate HER2 by dephosphorylation [reviewed in [124]]; The knock-down of PTPN9 has been shown to inhibit the tyrosyl phosphorylation of HER2 and EGFR in human breast cancer cell lines. It was suggested that PTPN9, as a negative regulator of HER2, can inhibit anchorage independent growth and invasion in breast cancer [125]. Similar observations were made for the PTPRO; its ability to inhibit proliferation in the mammary epithelial cell line MCF10 has been shown to be mediated by dephosphorylation and inactivation of HER2. Low levels of PTPRO have also been correlated with a decreased survival rate for patients with HER2-positive breast cancer [126].

In the case of the non-receptor phosphatase PTPN13 a potential new signaling cascade has been identified [127]. In this study it was reported that the PTPN13 substrate EphirinB1 interacts with HER2 in breast cancer cell lines. Src kinase causes phosphorylation of EphrinB1 and the initiation of the MAPK pathway, this is negatively regulated by PTPN13 [127, 128]. Overall, PTPN13 has been shown to be down-regulated in highly invasive breast cancer cell lines and to be correlated with tumour aggressiveness as well as a poor patient overall survival [127, 129, 128].

The role of PTPN1 in breast cancer is not well understood. The function of PTPN1 as an inhibitor of HER2 has been observed in fibroblasts, but not in mammary cells to date [reviewed in [124]]. In contrast to the previously mentioned PTPs, PTPN1 has been shown to be essential for HER2 mediated transformation in vitro [130]. It has been suggested that HER2 positively regulates the expression of PTPN1, which in turn positively regulates the RAS/MAPK pathway by interacting with RAS [131]. Early studies suggested that PTPN1 is overexpressed in up to 72.4% of breast tumours and is associated with HER2 overexpression [132]. More recently a study on a larger clinical cohort has shown PTPN1 to only be overexpressed in 49% of primary breast tumours. Moreover, they did not find a correlation with HER2 overexpression and suggested a favourable outcome for PTPN1 overexpressing breast cancer patients [133].

In addition, activation of HER2 leads to a transient inactivation of protein-tyrosine phosphatase α (PTPα) [134]; in this study knockdown of PTPα led to an increase in cell migration in a HER2 dependent manner. In breast epithelial cells with suppressed PTPα, HER2 activation leads to increased FAK Tyr-407 phosphorylation, recruitment of vinculin and the
formation of a novel FAK complex. This seems to be due to the prolonged interaction of GRB7 with HER2 and an increased association of HER2 with β1-integrin-rich complex, which depends on GRB7-SH2 domain interaction, in the absence of PTPα [134].

**Transforming Growth Factor Beta (TGF-β)**

The cytokine transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) is involved in numerous processes including development, differentiation, immune response and tumourigenesis [135]. After treatment of HER2-overexpressing mammary cells with TGF-β, the activated TGF-β receptor activates PI3K, which leads to the recruitment of actin and actinin to phosphorylated HER2 [136]. Additionally, TGF-β binding to TGF-β receptor can induce phosphorylation of TACE, which in turn causes the shedding of EGFR pro-ligands, thus initiating heterodimerisation of EGFR/HER2 and downstream signaling [137]. In these cells the HER2/actin/actinin complex is associated with Pak1, Rac1 as well as Vav2, which is needed for the localised activation of Rac1 at cell protrusions [136] (Fig. 6). Pak1, a main effector of Rac1, is known to interact with components of the cytoskeleton inducing cytoskeletal reorganisation [reviewed in [138]]. The activation of EGFR induces the Src-FAK pathway; FAK forms a complex with integrin α₆, β₁, β₄ and HER2, thereby connecting TGF-β signaling to integrin signaling [137], which is involved in adhesion, migration and cell morphology [reviewed in [139]]. It was observed that the mobility of the cells was dependent on the above described pathway. It was also observed that treatment with TGF-β, via this pathway, increases resistance of the cells against anoikis, a form of programmed cell death, as Rac1 phosphorylates regulators of apoptosis such as Bad or FKHR [136].

**The Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription (STATs)**

The STAT proteins are signaling proteins and transcription factors activated in response to cytokines and growth factors. STAT1 has been considered a tumour suppressor, as it inhibits proliferation by increasing expression of the cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor p21 or by decreasing the c-myc expression after IFN-y treatment [140]. It can also up-regulate expression of the apoptosis inducing caspases 2, 3 and 7 [141–143]. The tumour suppressor activity of STAT1 also includes the ability to suppress angiogenesis and tumour metastasis in mouse models [144]. Activation of STAT1 is controlled by the phosphorylation of tyrosine 701 and serine 727. The phosphorylation of Y701 causes a dimer formation with an increased DNA binding ability and the retention of the protein in the nucleus [145].

Inhibition of HER2 in HER2 overexpressing breast cancer cells causes a decrease in phosphorylation of STAT1; strong

**Fig. 6** The role of TGF-β in HER2 signaling. Treatment of HER2 expressing cells with TGF-β induces cytoskeletal reorganisation as well as the Ras/MAPK and PI3K/AKT pathways. TGF-β binding to TGF-β receptor can induce the phosphorylation of TACE, shedding of EGFR pro-ligands and thereby initiate heterodimerisation of EGFR/HER2 and activation of the Ras/MAPK and PI3K/AKT pathways [137]. A complex of Pak, Rac and Vav2, becomes associated with HER2, subsequently actin and actinin becomes reorganised [136]. In addition Src and FAK become associated with integrins α₆, β₁, β₄ in a complex with HER2 [137]. The illustration was adapted from Wang et al. 2006 and 2009 [136, 137]

EGFR/HER2 dimer signaling induces phosphorylation of STAT1, but it remains unclear as to whether HER2 directly phosphorylates STAT1 or if it is mediated via a downstream tyrosine kinase [146]. It has been suggested that the interaction of HER2 with STAT3 can induce STAT1 expression [147]. To date, it is unclear how the positive regulation of STAT1 by HER2 corresponds to the oncogenic function of HER2 in breast cancer [reviewed in [141]].

Another STAT family member STAT5 has recently been linked to HER2 in a study reporting that the truncated membrane-bound HER2 variant p110, but not the other variants of HER2, inhibits phosphorylation of STAT5. This could potentially lead to increased migration and invasiveness [39].

### Ion Channels and HER2 Signaling

Ion channels and transporters play essential roles to generate second messengers, and serve as effectors, in many different signaling pathways in normal and pathological conditions, including cancer. In addition to the previously mentioned EGFR-activated PLC-γ pathway, it has been reported that Heregulin-dependent dimerization of HER2 with HER3 can also increase the cytosolic Ca²⁺ in human breast cancer cells [148]. Interestingly, this study observed that the HER2 signaling-dependent release of Ca²⁺ from the endoplasmic reticulum and subsequent entry of activated Ca²⁺ via the store-operated Ca²⁺ channel was only observed in cells not overexpressing HER2 [148]. Similarly to EGFR, HER2 has been shown to bind calmodulin (CaM) in a Ca²⁺-dependent manner in human breast cancer cells [149]. Additionally, using a CaM inhibitor causes a decreased phosphorylation of HER2 and its downstream targets ERK1/2 and AKT [150]. Another Ca²⁺-binding protein S100A14, which is often overexpressed in breast cancer, has also been shown to bind to HER2 and positively regulate its phosphorylation and thereby the HER2 signaling pathway [151].

The Na⁺, HCO₃⁻ co-transporter NBCn1 plays an important role in cell mobility [152, 153]. Recently, NBCn1 has been linked to HER2; in the human breast cancer cell line MCF-7 with constitutively active HER2, NBCn1 was up-regulated [153]. The exact mechanism of how HER2 up-regulates the NBCn1-mediated acid extrusion is not known, although it may involve Krüppel-like factor 4 and transcription factor specificity protein 1 [152].

#### Function of Nuclear HER2

Traditionally, the ErbB family members are considered membrane-bound receptor tyrosine kinases; in the last 10 years, however, it has also been shown that they are present in the nucleus and can act as transcription factors [reviewed in [154]]. Nuclear HER2 proteins exist in both cell lines and

**Fig. 7** Nuclear HER2 and its function as a transcription factor. **a** HER2 can be observed both in the nucleus and on the cell membrane; here DCIS breast tissue shows nuclear HER2 and ductal carcinoma shows membrane-bound HER2 (N-terminal antibody, unpublished data). **b** HER2 can regulate cyclin D1 in a complex with STAT3, c-Jun, c-Fos, and PR.

primary tissues (Fig. 7) [reviewed in [155]]. In one study, nuclear HER2 has been associated with poor survival in breast cancer patients, when HER2 was also overexpressed on the cell membrane [156]. It is noteworthy to mention that in this study a polyclonal antibody against the C-terminus was used which allows for the detection of truncated HER2 variants in addition to full length HER2. HER2 present in the nucleus comprises of, at least partially, the full length protein, due to co-localisation of N and C-terminal antibodies.

A cluster of basic amino acid residues (676-KRRQQKIRKYTMRR-689), which are located shortly after the transmembrane domain in the cytoplasmic domain, could act as a nuclear localisation sequence, although no translocation of HER2 is possible without an active tyrosine kinase domain [155].

Nuclear HER2 has also been shown to bind to promoter regions within specific target genes, including cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), PRPK, MMP-16 and DDX-10 [155, 17], of these only COX-2 has been studied in any depth. Interestingly, COX-2 expression correlates with HER2 expression, but not expression of ERK1/2 or PEA3. This data shows that the correlation of HER2 and COX-2 is not always dependent on the RAS-MAPK pathway [157, 155]. COX-2 expression appears to be affected both by the level of membrane bound and nuclear HER2. The observed HER2 and COX-2 correlation is more apparent in metastatic tumours and has been associated with a poorer prognosis [17, 155].

### The Co-transcription Factor: Progesterone Receptor (PR)

As a ligand-induced transcription factor PR is known to bind its target genes after ligand mediated activation and initiate expression [16]. It has been documented that progestin can regulate expression of a number of cell cycle proteins, including cyclin D1, p21 and p27, although they do not contain a progesterone response element (PRE). This is mediated by a complex containing PR and other transcription factors [16]. The synthetic progestin medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) induces translocation of c-Fos and c-Jun to the nucleus via the p42/p44 MAPKs. Nuclear c-Fos and c-Jun, which are components of the AP-1 complex, co-localise with PR at the cyclin D1 promoter [158]. Earlier work from the same group showed that MPA also induces phosphorylation of STAT3 and HER2 and their assembly into a transcription complex at the STAT3 binding site of the cyclin D1 promoter [16]. Their study shows that HER2 and STAT3 are recruited to the response element of STAT3 and at the same time AP-1 and PR are also recruited to the response element of AP-1 on the cyclin D1 promoter. In addition, HER2 was only incorporated into the complex in the presence of c-Jun and c-Fos. The treatment with MPA also induces the histone H3 and H4 acetylation, which is associated with a chromatin structure favourable to gene transcription. The histone acetylation seems to happen in response to the

assembly of the transcription complex. Both AP-1 and nuclear HER2 seem to be essential for progestin dependent in vitro and in vivo growth [16, 158].

### In Summary

Although, the 5 year survival rate for women with breast cancer lies at 85.1 %, there were still over 11,550 women in 2010 dying from invasive breast cancer [159]. In recent years it has become clear that given the complex nature of cancer biology, therapy has to be tailored to the patient. Currently, breast tumours are mainly characterised by their tissue of origin, grade and their hormone receptor status. Five breast tumour subtypes have been defined: luminal A (ER and/or PR positive, HER2 negative), luminal B (ER and/or PR positive, HER2 positive), HER2 overexpressing (ER and PR negative, HER2 positive), basal-like (ER, PR and HER2 negative, cytokeratine 5/6 positive and/or EGFR positive) and normal breast like tumours [160, 161]. Even using treatments tailored according to our best knowledge, resistance is not uncommon. It has been noted that in HER2 overexpressing metastatic breast cancer up to 74 % of up to the patients were resistant to the HER2 targeting monoclonal antibody trastuzumab [162] and in 50 % of the cases there was no response to a combined therapy of trastuzumab with conventional chemotherapy [4, 3]. Similar percentages of resistant tumours can also be observed with the HER2 inhibitor lapatinib [163].

This review summarises our current knowledge on the regulation of HER2 expression and activation, the interplay between HER2 and other receptor proteins as well as the signaling pathways activated by HER2 (and their effect) to help improve our understanding of possible avenues of drug resistance. The extended HER2 network is important in HER2 overexpressing breast cancer but, given the crosstalk of HER2 with other hormone receptors [16, 11, 12, 15] HER2-targeted therapy could be of use in other subtypes of breast cancer. Although HER2 is most closely associated with breast cancer biology, it plays a role in other types of cancers [reviewed in [164]]; therefore this review is relevant to studies of other cancers and the goal to develop more effective treatment of metastatic disease.
