the Caucasian population. In the United States, more than 1 million new cases occur per year and in northern Australia incidence rates of 1–2% per year have been reported [1]. The incidence in Europe is 300/100,000 per year for BCC, and 150/100,000 per year for SCC. BCCs, which
whereas the apoptosis inhibitors, bcl-2 and FLIP are strongly expressed.

### 4. Formation of NMSCs

Ultraviolet-light exposure, white skin, blue eyes, red hair, Celtic ancestry, and inability to tan [1] have been identified as risk factors for BCC and SCC. Sunlight and its underlying UVB (290–315 nm) radiation is most effective
but not yet proven that FasL serves for immune escape of
BCC and SCC.

6. Downregulation of FasL on BCC by antisense
oligonucleotides or small interfering RNAs (siRNAs)

How could the immune escape theory in BCC be proven? One possibility is by ‘knocking out’ the *FasL* gene in vivo and evaluate whether the tumor
