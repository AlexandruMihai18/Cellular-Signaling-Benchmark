# Just The Beginning: Novel Functions for Angiotensin-Converting Enzymes

Urs Eriksson¹, Ursula Danilczyk¹ and Josef M. Penninger²

Cardiovascular disease is predicted to be the commonest cause of death worldwide by the year 2020. Diabetes, smoking and hypertension are the main risk factors. The renin-angiotensin system plays a key role in regulating blood pressure and fluid and electrolyte homeostasis in mammals. The discovery of specific drugs that block either the key enzyme of the renin-angiotensin system, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), or the receptor for its main effector molecule angiotensin II, which acts both as a systemic and a locally generated paracrine or autocrine effector peptide [1–3] (Figure 1). The protease renin, which is secreted by juxtaglomerular cells at the renal afferent arterioles, cleaves the liver-derived precursor peptide angiotensinogen into the decameric peptide angiotensin I. Angiotensin I is further hydrolyzed into the vasoconstrictor octapeptide angiotensin II by the proteolytic dipeptidase ACE, located on the luminal side of the vascular endothelium, and other non-ACE systems, such as tissue chymase at the tissue level [8]. ACE also inactivates the vasodilator peptides bradykinin and kallidin. Thus, activation of the renin-angiotensin system mainly results in a systemic vasopressor response by blocking the hypotensive kinin-bradykinin pathway and by generation of the vasoconstrictor angiotensin II [4].

Angiotensin II is not just a potent vasopressor which raises systemic blood pressure; it also mediates a broad array of physiological and pathophysiological effects by binding to specific cell membrane receptors [9,10]. So far, two distinct types of G-protein-coupled receptors for angiotensin II have been cloned and characterized in humans and rodents. The angiotensin II type 1 (AT₁) and type 2 (AT₂) receptors are heterogeneously distributed in peripheral tissues and the brain [9,10]. The AT₁ receptor is predominantly expressed in the kidneys, adrenal glands, vascular smooth muscle cells and the heart, and it is to this receptor that the regulatory actions of angiotensin II on blood pressure and salt/water balance have been attributed [9,11,12]. The AT₂ receptor is present at high density during fetal development; in the adult, significant AT₂ receptor expression occurs only in the adrenal medulla, uterus, ovary, vascular endothelium, adrenal glands and certain areas in the brain [4,9]. The AT₂ receptor is thought to counterbalance effects mediated by the AT₁ receptor: it appears to induce vasodilation and may be involved in the control of cell proliferation, differentiation and angiogenesis [4,10,11].

A Broad Array of Biologically Active Peptides
In vivo, angiotensin II is degraded into several metabolites by different enzymes (Figure 2). So far, it has been shown that at least five of these products are biologically active [4]. Interestingly, these metabolites have different biological effects. Angiotensin III, which is cleaved from angiotensin II by an aminopeptidase, binds to both AT₁ and AT₂ receptors and acts similar to angiotensin II [13]. In contrast, angiotensin(1–7), a product of angiotensin II as well as of the angiotensin I metabolite angiotensin(1–9), appears to have vasodilatory [14–16] and antiproliferative effects mediated by binding a novel, not yet defined, angiotensin(1–7) receptor [17].

Angiotensin IV is generated from angiotensin III by an as yet unknown pathway. In the kidneys, angiotensin IV

Introduction
The renin-angiotensin system is a complex regulatory system that plays a key role in maintaining blood pressure homeostasis, as well as fluid and salt balance in mammals [1–4]. The angiotensin converting-enzyme (ACE) is an important regulator of the renin-angiotensin system. Recently, a homologue of human ACE, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), has been discovered [5,6]. Characterisation of its function and substrate specificity [5,6], together with data from ace2 mutant mice [7], suggests that ACE2 negatively regulates the activated renin-angiotensin system. In this review we shall discuss the functions of ACE and ACE2 and their substrates and products in the regulation of the renin-angiotensin system.

enhances natriuresis and increases renal blood flow. There is evidence that, in the central nervous system, angiotensin IV facilitates memory retention and retrieval [4,12]. The effects of angiotensin IV involve a novel AT₄ receptor [18,19]. The AT₄ receptor has also been identified as an insulin-regulated aminopeptidase [19], suggesting an indirect mechanism whereby angiotensin IV might extend the half-life of biologically active neuropeptides by competitive inhibition of AT₄'s enzyme activity [4,19].

The diversity of the renin-angiotensin system is not only demonstrated by the different effects of the various degradation products of angiotensin I and angiotensin II. Characterisation of receptor specificities and enzymes involved in the degradation of angiotensin metabolites has revealed far more complex mediator systems than previously recognised. It appears that the complexity of the renin-angiotensin system guarantees well-tuned adaptation of the blood supply of the body compartments and organs to all possible physiologic conditions. In this complex system, a key role has been attributed to the rate-limiting enzymes, ACE and ACE2, via their action in generating or degrading the various active mediators.

### Angiotensin Converting-Enzyme (ACE)
ACE was termed a ‘hypertensin-converting enzyme’ when it was initially isolated in 1956 [20]. The human *ace* gene, located on chromosome 17, encodes a 180 kDa protein with two homologous domains. Each domain has an active zinc-binding motif, His-Glu-X-X-His, which is found in many peptidases [3,21] (Figure 3). ACE is anchored to the plasma membrane through a single carboxy-terminal transmembrane domain. In humans, two distinct ACE isoenzymes have been described, an abundant somatic form found on the endothelial surface of the lungs and on brush-border membranes of kidneys, intestine, placenta and choroid plexus, and the germinal form of ACE found only in the testis [4]. The function of the germinal form

of ACE remains unclear, but the fact that fertility is impaired in ace-deficient mice [22,23], but not in AT₁A receptor knock-out mice [24], suggests that testicular ACE does not mediate its effects via angiotensin II–AT₁A interactions. Both ACE isoforms are membrane-bound protein and, at the cell surface, they function as ectoenzymes which hydrolyze circulating peptides. ACE may be cleaved from the cell surface and act as a soluble enzyme, but the biological significance of soluble ACE remains unclear.

ACE is currently thought to have two major activities: it acts as a peptidyl dipeptidase which removes the carboxy-terminal dipeptide from its substrate, and as endopeptidase on substrates that are amidated at the carboxyl terminus (Figure 3). The emerging picture of ACE function is that it is more than just a key enzyme that catalyses cleavage of angiotensin I to the potent vasoconstrictor peptide angiotensin II [3,4,20]. ACE also hydrolyzes the inactive angiotensin₁₋₉ peptide into the vasodilator metabolite angiotensin₁₋₇ [25], and it is additionally thought to inactivate the vasodilator peptides bradykinin and kallidin [25,26]. Furthermore, it acts as endopeptidase on the multi-functional neuropeptides substance P and cholecystokinin, and may degrade the luteinizing hormone releasing hormone [4,27]. In this context, however, its biological significance is not known, nor has the possibility of functional crosstalk between the systems been excluded.

The finding that ACE catalyzes cleavage of angiotensin I into angiotensin II, together with the elucidation of ACE’s three-dimensional structure, led to the design of specific ACE inhibitors. Inhibition of ACE results in lowering of blood pressure by impaired formation of angiotensin II and reduced degradation of the hypotensive peptides bradykinin and kallidin. Numerous potent ACE inhibitors have been synthesized subsequently and evaluated in clinical trials [28].

Aside from lowering blood pressure, ACE inhibitors have been found to improve the prognosis of patients with congestive heart failure and after myocardial

infarction [29]. These clinical findings widened our understanding of the renin-angiotensin system and suggested that it must have additional functions. Pharmacological inhibition of ACE by ACE inhibitors has become a mainstay in treatment of hypertension, cardiac failure and diabetic nephropathy.

### Angiotensin Converting-Enzyme 2

ACE2 has been recently identified as a homolog of ACE in human, mouse and rat [5–7]; the human ace2 gene has been cloned and mapped to the X chromosome [7]. ACE2 is predicted to be a 805 amino acid, type I membrane-bound glycoprotein with a molecular weight of about 120 kDa. Like ACE, ACE2 has two domains: the amino-terminal catalytic domain and the carboxy-terminal domain (Figure 3). The catalytic domain has one active site — the zinc metallo-peptidase domain — and shows 41.8% sequence identity with the amino domain of ACE [4–6]. ACE2’s carboxy-terminal domain shows 48% sequence identity with collectrin [30] (Figure 3), a novel renal-specific type 1 transmembrane glycoprotein that lacks the metalloprotease catalytic domain of ACE and ACE2. In contrast to ACE, ACE2 expression appears to be limited to heart, kidney and testis [6,7]. At the cellular level, ACE2 is mainly confined to the endothelium and renal tubular epithelium; occasionally it is identified on vascular smooth muscle cells [6,7].

As an enzyme, ACE2 functions as a carboxy-monopeptidase with a preference for carboxy-terminal hydrophobic or basic residues [31]. So whereas ACE cleaves two amino acids, ACE2 cleaves only the carboxy-terminal amino acid (Figure 3). Although ACE and ACE2 share many biochemical properties, ACE2 activity is unaffected by classical ACE inhibitors, such as captopril or enalapril, and its specificity is distinct from ACE [5,25]. ACE2 hydrolyses angiotensin I, the inactive precursor of angiotensin II, to generate angiotensin(1–9) peptides [25,31]. Angiotensin(1–9), in turn, can be converted to the vasodilator peptide angiotensin(1–7) by ACE. ACE2 also directly converts angiotensin II to angiotensin(1–7). Angiotensin(1–7) has been proposed to be an important regulator of cardiovascular function, promoting vasodilatation, apoptosis and growth arrest [4,32,33], but the significance of this metabolite in humans is controversial. Nevertheless, it will be interesting to test whether ACE2 modulates angiotensin II-mediated effects in the heart and kidneys *in vivo* by degradation of angiotensin II and/or the generation of additional vasodilator peptides.

The specificity of ACE2, like that of ACE, is not limited to angiotensin I and II. ACE2 also acts on several other classes of peptides [31] (Figure 2). The kinin metabolites, des-Arg<sup>10</sup>-kallidin (des-Arg<sup>10</sup>-Lys<sup>1</sup>-bradykinin) and des-Arg<sup>9</sup>-bradykinin, but not bradykinin, itself are both hydrolyzed by ACE2 [30]. Both of these metabolites activate the G-protein-coupled B<sub>1</sub> receptor [34,35], which is upregulated in response to tissue injury and may be important in mediating inflammatory responses [32], including the local release of nitric oxide [36].

ACE2 also acts on the peptides apelin-13 and apelin-36 with high catalytic efficiency [31]. Apelin is synthesized as 77 amino-acid preprohormone, which is processed into the 36 amino acid peptide apelin-36; further proteolytic cleavage generates apelin-13 [37,38]. The physiological role of the apelins is not yet fully understood [39–41], though apelin-13 has been shown to promote vasoconstriction in endothelium-denuded coronary arteries [41] and systemic administration of apelin-13 prompts hypotension in rats [42]. Two opioid peptides, dynorphin A (1–13) and β-casomorphin, are also substrates of ACE2 [31]. These peptides activate G-protein-coupled κ and δ opioid receptors, which regulate pain perception and may have negative affects on cardiomyocyte contractility [43–45]. Other substrates for ACE2 include neurotensin and the related peptide kinetensin, but several other regulatory peptides, including the enkephalins, are not ACE2 substrates [31]. Together, the recent findings suggest a multi-functional role for ACE2, not only in the renin-angiotensin system, but also in neurotransmission including pain perception.

#### Blood Pressure Regulation

Hypertension is recognized to be a major risk factor for arteriosclerosis [46]. The renin-angiotensin system has been recognized as the main regulator linking the extracellular fluid volume to blood pressure homeostasis. Reduction of the perfusion pressure in the afferent renal arterioles, as a result of a decrease in either systemic blood pressure or extracellular volume, or deterioration of renal arteries, results in reduced glomerular filtration and a decreased amount of sodium entering the proximal tubuli. In turn, this stimulates renin secretion in the kidneys. This mechanism, termed tubuloglomerular feedback (reviewed in [47]), ultimately results in increased angiotensin II

production. Angiotensin II raises systemic blood pressure by peripheral vasoconstriction and promotes sodium reabsorption in the kidney, both indirectly by stimulating aldosterone secretion from the adrenal cortex and directly by acting on the AT1 receptor [48].

In over 90% of the cases hypertension is considered to be 'essential', in the clinical sense of not having one distinct cause. Although in a high proportion of these patients screening of serum aldosterone and plasma renin activity reveals primary hyperaldosteronism [49], the etiology of essential hypertension is not yet clear [46]. Rather, it appears that essential hypertension is multi-factorial, depending on diet (for example a high salt diet), environment and genetic factors.

Several quantitative trait loci (QTL) that affect susceptibility to hypertension have been identified [50,51]. The possibility that ACE2 plays a role in essential hypertension was suggested when ace2 was mapped to the QTL on the X chromosome in hypertensive rats. This chromosomal region overlaps with the SS-X QTL in salt-sensitive Sabra rats, the BP3 QTL in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats and the BB.Xs QTL in spontaneous hypertensive rats [7]. In all these rat strains, ACE2 mRNA and protein levels were found to be greatly reduced and inversely correlated with increased blood pressure [7].

These data provide evidence that ACE2 has a role in the pathogenesis of hypertension. The fact that ACE2 is produced primarily in the heart and the kidneys reflects the critical role of these organs in controlling blood pressure homeostasis. But the mechanisms by which ACE2 regulates blood pressure remain unclear. Furthermore, collectrin, the ACE2 homolog made exclusively in kidneys, may play an important role in controlling ACE/ACE2 functions. Homology searches of the human genome indicate that the collectrin gene is located on chromosome Xp22, about 26 kilobases from the ace2 gene. As collectrin lacks the carboxypeptidase domain it may regulate blood pressure through a process not dependent on angiotensin II.

In vivo models using mice deficient in the key enzymes renin and ACE, angiotensinogen or the AT₁a receptor have greatly advanced our knowledge of the renin-angiotensin system and confirmed its role in blood pressure regulation. Indeed, under physiological conditions these mutant mice all show reduced blood pressure relative to wild-type. Mice deficient in renin, angiotensinogen or ACE all show altered kidney morphology and function [22,52], and those deficient in ACE, angiotensinogen or AT₁/AT₂ receptors all show impaired somatic growth [22,52,53].

Mice deficient for the ACE2 gene have recently been described [7]. These mice develop normally, and despite the genetic association of ACE2 with hypertension in rat strains they have normal blood pressure and renal histology [7]. But levels of the vasopressor angiotensin II are moderately increased in the ACE2-deficient mice: so is ACE2 a negative regulator of blood pressure control in vivo? As ACE2 has a broad substrate specificity, it cannot be excluded that in ACE2-deficient mice the hypertensive effects of elevated angiotensin II levels are blunted by compensatory changes in other regulatory peptides, such as angiotensin(1-7) [32,54], the kinin metabolites [35] or the newly discovered apelin system [42]. Given that the susceptibility to essential hypertension is multifactorial, it appears that a lack of ACE2 activity predisposes to, rather than causes, hypertension [50,55].

ACE2 is a Negative Regulator of ACE in the Heart

As mentioned, ACE2-deficient mice show increased tissue angiotensin II levels; they also show upregulation of hypoxia genes in the heart and severe cardiac dysfunction [7]. Indeed, the most striking phenotype of the ACE2 mutant mice is of a profound decrease in cardiac contractility [7]. Despite the elevated plasma and heart angiotensin II levels, there is no evidence in these mutant mice for structural alterations such as myocardial fibrosis, hypertrophy or dilation. Rather intriguingly, ACE2 mutant hearts resemble certain kinds of defective heart found in human cases of coronary artery disease and after bypass surgery — in particular, those cases referred to as ‘cardiac stunning’ [56] and ‘hibernation’ [57]. In these human diseases and related animal models, chronic hypoxic conditions lead to compensatory changes in myocyte metabolism [56,58], upregulation of hypoxia-induced genes [59] and reduced heart function [56,57,60].

Importantly, the cardiac dysfunction observed in ACE2 mutant mice is completely reversed by a second mutation that causes ACE deficiency [7]. Normal cardiac function in ACE, ACE2 double mutant mice suggests that a catalytic product of ACE triggers contractile impairment in the absence of ACE2, supporting the hypothesis that ACE2 is indeed a critical negative regulator of the cardiac effects of the renin-angiotensin system. So far, the mechanism by which the absence of ACE2 induces impairment of cardiac contractility has not been elucidated.

Given the moderately enhanced angiotensin II levels in ACE2 mutant mice and the upregulation of hypoxia-induced genes [7], it is tempting to speculate whether

the observed heart phenotype of ACE2 mutants is the result of angiotensin II-mediated hypoperfusion, which in turn is caused by vasoconstriction and endothelial dysfunction [61,62]. Indeed, *in vitro* studies have shown that angiotensin II directly induces hypoxia-inducible factor-1α and VEGF in smooth muscle cells and cardiomyocytes [63]. Furthermore, it has been shown that angiotensin II causes endothelial dysfunction via the AT₁A receptor and induction of oxidative stress [61,64]. This view is supported by the fact that ACE2 is expressed only in the vascular endothelium, and not on cardiac myocytes [7]. Given the broad specificity of ACE2 for various peptide systems, it is not clear whether the elevated vascular tone of ACE2 mutant hearts is due simply to an unopposed effect of angiotensin II, or whether alterations in the local availability of other mediators also play a part (Figure 4). For example, angiotensin(1-7), which is cleaved from angiotensin I by ACE2, acts as vasodilatory peptide on coronary arteries and preserves heart function and coronary artery perfusion in rats after myocardial infarction [65].

It thus appears that ACE2 does negatively regulate the activated renin-angiotensin system, probably by diverting the generation of the vasoactive peptide angiotensin II towards inactive and vasodilatory peptides. Given that ACE2 is primarily expressed in the kidneys and the heart only [6,7], it is intriguing to speculate that ACE2 has been conserved during evolution as a negative regulator of the renin-angiotensin system in those organs whose vital function critically depends on the maintenance of a constant blood supply, even in the presence of a systemic vasopressor response.

Perspectives

Studies of ACE2 single mutant and ACE, ACE2 double mutant mice indicate that ACE2 is a negative regulator of the renin-angiotensin system. It is not clear, however, whether this function is mediated by ACE2’s metallopeptidase or collectrin-like domain activities. ACE2’s carboxypeptidase activity may limit the availability of angiotensin II, or may generate counterregulatory vasodilator peptide products. If the ACE2 mutant phenotype of decreased cardiac contractility is indeed due to excess angiotensin II at the endothelium-smooth muscle interface, one would expect that ACE2, angiotensin II receptor double mutant mice will turn out to have normal cardiac function. Given the complexity of the involved systems, *in vivo* studies with mutant mice or specific blocking agents appear to be the most straightforward approach to further elucidating the roles of ACE and ACE2 in regulating the renin-angiotensin system.

If the physiological role of ACE does not involve its metallopeptidase activity, it is conceivable that the collectrin like-domain is involved. ACE2 and collectrin are both upregulated upon tissue injury: ACE2 in heart failure and collectrin in renal injury [60]. The development of novel inhibitors specific to the collectrin-domain of ACE2, and the generation of collectrin-deficient mice, should provide important information

on the physiological roles of this protein domain and address the question whether it is involved in the renin-angiotensin system.

So far the ACE2 mutant mice have not added much to our understanding of ACE2’s role in blood pressure regulation. Key experiments remain to be done, such as testing whether increasing ACE2 expression in defined hypertensive rat strains ameliorates the increased blood pressure. Polymorphisms of ACE or angiotensin have not yet been clearly shown yet to be associated with hypertension; analyses of small nucleotide polymorphisms might reveal whether ACE2 polymorphisms are indeed associated with abnormal blood pressure in some individuals. Moreover, ACE2 polymorphisms might be useful to assessing patients for their future risk of developing heart failure or coronary heart disease.

The role of hypoxia-inducible genes in ACE2 mutant mice also needs to be addressed. Does upregulation of those genes reflect an adaptive response to impaired tissue oxygenation following a reduction in coronary blood flow (Figure 4)? Is the upregulation of hypoxia-induced genes coupled to pathways mediating cardiac dysfunction [66,67] or is the impaired cardiomyocyte contractility directly linked to angiotensin II-mediated alterations to the intracellular calcium level [68,69]? That ACE2 mutant mice show normal growth and development, despite clearly impaired cardiac function, suggests the existence of efficient compensatory mechanisms which might be linked to the upregulation of hypoxia-induced genes and their products.

To address the compensatory capacity of the renin-angiotensin system in the absence of ACE2, ACE2 mutant mice should be exposed to various stresses, including hypoxia, myocardial ischemia or systemic inflammation. Such data may have important clinical implications. For example, systemic inflammatory response syndrome involves critically impaired perfusion of kidneys, intestine and other tissues, as well as cardiac dysfunction [70]. The question arises as to what extent impaired cardiac function [71,72] and renal failure [70] reflect endothelial dysfunction and hypoperfusion which overwhelm the counter-regulatory capacity of the ACE2 system? If this is indeed the case, it might define new goals in the approach towards understanding and treatment of sepsis mediated multi-organ failure.

We used to feel that we understood the renin-angiotensin system. But the discovery of new enzymes, new peptides and new regulatory pathways shows that this system is actually far more complex than we thought. This complexity will not only broaden our knowledge on the evolution and biology of blood pressure regulation, organ perfusion and salt/water balance, but also offers a chance to develop new and refined therapeutic strategies by aiming at new enzymes, peptides, and receptors. The development of ACE inhibitors and AT receptor blockers was just the beginning.
