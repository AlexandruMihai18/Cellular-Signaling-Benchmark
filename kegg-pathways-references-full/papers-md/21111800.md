## Abstract

A non-enzymatic reaction between ketones or aldehydes and the amino groups of proteins, lipids and nucleic acids contributes to the aging of macromolecules and to the development and progression of various age-related disorders such as vascular complications of diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, cancer growth and metastasis, insulin resistance and degenerative bone disease. Under hyperglycemic and/or oxidative stress conditions, this process begins with the conversion of reversible Schiff base adducts, and then to more stable, covalently-bound Amadori rearrangement products. Over a course of days to weeks, these early glycation products undergo further reactions and rearrangements to become irreversibly crossed-linked, fluorescent protein derivatives termed advanced glycation end products (AGEs). There is a growing body of evidence that AGE and their receptor RAGE (receptor for AGEs) interaction elicits oxidative stress, inflammatory reactions and thrombosis, thereby being involved in vascular aging and damage. These observations suggest that the AGE–RAGE system is a novel therapeutic target for preventing diabetic vascular complications. In this paper, we review the pathophysiological role of the AGE–RAGE-oxidative stress system and its therapeutic intervention in vascular damage in diabetes. We also discuss here the potential utility of the restriction of food-derived AGEs in diabetic vascular complications.

## 1. Introduction

Chronic hyperglycemia is a major initiator of vascular complications of diabetes. Various hyperglycemia-elicted metabolic and hemodynamic derangements such as increased formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs), enhanced production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), stimulation of protein kinase C (PKC) and the polyol pathway, and the activation of the renin–angiotensin system (RAS) have been proposed to contribute to the characteristic histopathological changes in diabetic vessels (Yamagishi and Imaizumi, 2005; Brownlee, 2001). Although which molecular pathways are the most dominant one remains to be elucidated, recent clinical studies have substantiated the concept of ‘metabolic memory’ in the pathogenesis of diabetic vascular complications (Ceriello et al., 2009). Indeed, the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial-Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications (DCCT-EDIC) Research, has revealed that the reduction in the risk of progressive retinopathy and nephropathy resulting from intensive therapy in patients with type 1 diabetes persisted for at least several years after the DCCT trial, despite increasing hyperglycemia (Anon, 2000; Writing Team For The Diabetes Control And Complications Trial/Epidemiology Of Diabetes Interventions And Complications Research Group, 2003). Intensive therapy during the DCCT resulted in decreased progression of intima-media thickness and subsequently reduced the risk of nonfatal myocardial infarction, stroke, or death from cardiovascular disease by 57% 11 years after the end of the trials (Nathan et al., 2003, 2005). Further, a recent follow-up study of UKPDS, called UKPDS80, also has shown that benefits of an intensive therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes are

sustained after the cessation of the trial (Holman et al., 2008). In this study, despite an early loss of glycemic differences between intensive and conventional therapy, a continued reduction in microvascular risk and emergent risk reductions for myocardial infarction and death from any cause were observed during 10 years of post-trial follow-up (Holman et al., 2008). These findings demonstrate that so-called ‘metabolic memory’ may cause chronic abnormalities in diabetic vessels that are not easily reversed, even by subsequent, relatively good control of blood glucose, thus suggesting a long-term beneficial influence of early metabolic control (legacy effect) on the risk of diabetic retinopathy, nephropathy, cardiovascular disease (CVD) and death in both type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients. Among the various biochemical pathways which are supposed to be involved in vascular complications in diabetes, the biochemical nature of AGEs and their mode of action are most compatible with the concept of ‘metabolic memory’ (Brownlee et al., 1988; Vlassara and Palace, 2002; Takeuchi and Yamagishi, 2009).

AGEs are formed by the Maillard process, a non-enzymatic reaction between ketones or aldehydes, the amino groups of proteins, lipids and nucleic acids that contributes to the aging of macromolecules (Takeuchi and Yamagishi, 2009; Dyer et al., 1991; Stern et al., 2002). Under hyperglycemic and/or oxidative stress conditions, this process begins with the conversion of reversible Schiff base adducts to more stable, covalently-bound Amadori rearrangement products (Takeuchi and Yamagishi, 2009; Dyer et al., 1991). Over the course of days to weeks, these Amadori products undergo further rearrangement reactions to form the irreversibly-bound moieties known as AGEs. The formation and accumulation of AGEs have been known to progress in a normal aging process and at an accelerated rate under diabetes. Recent studies have confirmed that AGEs and receptor for AGEs (RAGE) interaction elicits oxidative stress generation in various types of cells and subsequently evokes vascular inflammation, macrophage and platelet activation, and thrombosis, thereby playing an important role in the development and progression of vascular complications in diabetes (Stern et al., 2002; Bierhaus et al., 1998; Yamagishi et al., 2008a,b; Takenaka et al., 2006). Therefore, the blockade of interaction of AGEs with RAGE and/or suppression of the RAGE downstream pathway may be a therapeutic strategy for diabetic vascular complications. Moreover, AGEs are not only generated under hyperglycemic conditions, but also derived exogenously from AGE-rich meal (Uribarri et al., 2010). In other words, diet is a major environmental source of pro-inflammatory AGEs (Uribarri et al., 2010). These observations suggest that restriction of food-derived AGEs or inhibition of absorption of dietary AGEs may also be a novel target for therapeutic strategy in vascular complications in diabetes.

We review here the role of both endogenously generated- and exogenously derived-AGEs, RAGE and other AGE receptors in diabetic vascular complications. We also discuss the therapeutic intervention of AGEs, i.e., their receptor axis for preventing vascular damage in diabetes.

### 2. Role of AGEs in diabetic retinopathy

The earliest histopathological hallmark of diabetic retinopathy is loss of pericytes (Frank, 1991). In parallel with loss of pericytes, several characteristic changes including thickening of the basement membrane, hyperpermeability, and microaneurysm formation are observed (Frank, 1991). Since pericytes have played an important role in the maintenance of microvascular homeostasis, loss of pericytes could predispose the vessels to angiogenesis, thrombogenesis and endothelial cell (EC) injury, thus leading to full-blown clinical expression of diabetic retinopathy (Yamagishi and Imaizumi, 2005). Recently, Hammes et al. investigated the role of capillary coverage with pericytes in early diabetic retinopathy and the contribution to proliferative retinopathy using mice with a single functional allele of platelet-derived growth factor-B (PDGF-B(+/−)) mice (Hammes et al., 2002). They demonstrated that retinal capillary coverage with pericytes was crucial for the survival of ECs, particularly under stress conditions such as diabetes, and that pericyte deficiency led to reduced inhibition of EC proliferation, thus promoting angiogenesis in the retinopathy of prematurity model.

Retinal pericytes accumulate AGEs during diabetes (Stitt et al., 1997), which would be expected to have a detrimental influence on pericyte survival and function. Indeed, we have previously shown that the AGE-RAGE interaction elicits ROS generation in cultured retinal pericytes, thereby inducing apoptotic cell death of pericytes (Yamagishi et al., 2002a,b). AGEs induced nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activation, decreased the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax, and subsequently increased the activity of caspase-3, a key enzyme in the execution of apoptosis of pericytes (Yamagishi et al., 2002a,b). Moreover, AGEs up-regulated RAGE mRNA levels in pericytes through the intracellular ROS generation (Yamagishi et al., 2002c). These positive feedback loops transduced the AGE signals again, thus further exacerbating the cytotoxic effects of AGEs on retinal pericytes. With regard to the source of ROS generation elicited by the AGE-RAGE interaction, we have recently found that beraprost sodium, a prostacyclin analogue, or forskolin, an activator of adenylate cyclase, protects against the AGE-induced pericyte apoptosis by suppressing ROS generation and subsequent RAGE overexpression (Yamagishi et al., 2002c). Since cyclic AMP elevating agents were known to block ROS generation in neutrophils by inhibiting reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase activity (Alikhani et al., 2010), NADPH oxidase might be a source of ROS production elicited by AGEs and also be a target of beraprost sodium. Recently, carboxymethyllysine (CML)-collagen but not control collagen has been shown to stimulate apoptosis, caspase-3 activity, and forkhead box O1 (FOXO1) DNA-binding activity in retinal pericytes (Alikhani et al., 2010). p38 and Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) are reported to induce FOXO1 activation and subsequent apoptosis in pericytes (Alikhani et al., 2010). In animal studies, treatment of diabetic rats for 26 weeks with aminoguanidine, a hydrazine compound with inhibitory effects on AGE formation, prevented a 2.6-fold accumulation of AGEs at branching sites of pre-capillary arterioles and thereby prevented abnormal EC proliferation and significantly diminished pericyte dropout (Hammes et al., 1991). The derivative of vitamin B₆, pyridoxamine, has been shown to an efficacious and specific post-Amadori inhibitor, with the ability to prevent up-regulation of retinal basement membrane-associated genes and capillary dropout (Stitt et al., 2002). Moreover, an antioxidant, alpha-lipoic acid administration decreased retinal 8-hydroxy-2′deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and nitrotyrosine levels and subsequently inhibited capillary cell apoptosis in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats (Kowluru and Odenbach, 2004). These observations further support the active participation of the AGE-RAGE-mediated ROS generation in pericyte loss at early phase of diabetic retinopathy. RAGE is not the only receptor capable of binding to AGEs. So, it is conceivable that other AGE receptors are also involved in the AGE signaling. AGE receptor-1 (AGER1) inhibited the AGE-induced ROS generation and subsequent NF-κB activation in mesangial cells, a counterpart of pericytes in the kidney by promoting AGE degradation (Cai et al., 2006). Serum and tissue CML levels were lower in AGER1-transgenic mice than in control wild-type mice.

Pericyte dysfunction has also been considered one of the characteristic changes of the early phase of diabetic retinopathy (Hammes et al., 2002). AGEs act on pericytes to stimulate vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression (Yamagishi et al., 2002b). VEGF is a specific mitogen to ECs, also known as vascular permeability factor, and is thought to be a pivotal factor in the pathogenesis of proliferative diabetic retinopathy (Aiello et al., 1994). Furthermore, the VEGF level was found to be associated with the breakdown of the blood-retinal barrier, thus being involved in retinal vascular hyperpermeability in background retinopathy (Murata et al., 1995; Yamagishi et al., 2006). These observations suggest that AGEs

might be involved in the development and progression of diabetic retinopathy by inducing VEGF overexpression in pericytes as well.

There has been increasing interest in the role of inflammatory reaction in diabetic retinopathy (Schroder et al., 1991). AGEs are implicated in the process of vascular inflammation as well. Indeed, AGEs have been recently shown to increase leukocyte adhesion to cultured retinal microvascular ECs by inducing intracellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) expression (Moore et al., 2003). This phenomenon is also apparent in non-diabetic mice infused with preformed AGEs, which results in significant leukostasis and blood-retinal barrier dysfunction in these mice. Retinal VEGF has been found to induce ICAM-1 expression, thus leading to leukostasis and breakdown of blood-retinal barrier *in vivo* (Lu et al., 1999). Therefore, the AGE-elicted pro-inflammatory reactions could be mediated by VEGF expression. Moreover, we have recently found that AGEs increase monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and ICAM-1 expression in microvascular ECs through intracellular ROS generation, thereby inducing T-cell adhesion to ECs (Yamagishi et al., 2007a; Inagaki et al., 2003). Since the levels of MCP-1 in vitreous fluids are correlated with the severity of proliferative diabetic retinopathy (Mitamura et al., 2001), AGEs would be one of the key pro-inflammatory factors for the progression of diabetic retinopathy. In addition, AGEs not only decrease endothelial nitric oxide synthase mRNA levels in ECs, but also reduce NO (nitric oxide) bioavailability by inactivating NO to form peroxynitrite via ROS generation (Yamagishi et al., 2007b). Reduced synthesis and/or bioavailability of NO may accelerate vascular injury in diabetic retinopathy because NO is known to exert anti-inflammatory properties *in vivo* (Yamagishi et al., 2007).

Microthrombosis formation contributes to capillary obliteration and retinal ischemia, thus being involved in the progression of diabetic retinopathy (Yamagishi and Imaizumi, 2005). Several researchers reported that AGE-bovine serum albumin or AGE-poly-L-lysine prepared *in vitro* augmented platelet aggregation induced by ADP or serotonin in a dose-dependent manner (Hasegawa et al., 2002; Hangashi et al., 1998). Since AGEs elicited superoxide generation in platelets and that superoxide dismutase or indomethacin abolished the enhancing effects of AGEs on the platelet aggregation, AGEs could augment the platelet aggregation through oxidative stress generation and subsequent prostanoid production (Hangashi et al., 1998). *In vivo* AGE-proteins have also been shown to elicit platelet activation (Zoltowska et al., 2004). Furthermore, in diabetic patients, there was a significant correlation between serotonin-induced platelet

2001). Inhibition of VEGF also prevents glomerular hypertrophy in a model of obese type 2 diabetes, Zucker diabetic fatty rat (Schrijvers et al., 2006). Furthermore, urinary VEGF levels are positively correlated with the urinary albumin to creatinine ratio, and negatively correlated with creatinine clearance in type 2 diabetic patients (Kim et al., 2005). These observations suggest that urinary VEGF might be used as a sensitive marker of diabetic nephropathy. VEGF overproduction elicited by AGEs may be involved in diabetic nephropathy.

Moreover, we have recently found that AGEs stimulate MCP-1 expression in mesangial cells as well (Yamagishi et al., 2002d, 2007c). Increased MCP-1 expression associated with monocyte infiltration in mesangium has been observed in the early phase of diabetic nephropathy (Banba et al., 2000). Plasma MCP-1 was positively correlated with urinary albumin excretion rate in type 1 diabetic patients (Chiarelli et al., 2002). AGE accumulation in glomerulus could also be implicated in the initiation of diabetic nephropathy by promoting the secretion of MCP-1. Cyclic AMP could block the AGE-signaling in mesangial cells as well because we have recently found that glucagon-like peptide-1 inhibits AGE-induced vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) mRNA levels in mesangial cells by suppressing RAGE expression via cyclic AMP elevation (Ishibashi et al., 2010). Therefore, there are analogies of the AGE-RAGE signaling between pericytes and mesangial cells; AGE-RAGE interaction in both pericytes and mesangial cells elicits apoptotic cell death and VEGF and MCP-1 overexpression, thus being involved in diabetic microangiopathies, whose signaling pathway is blocked by cyclic AMP.

AGEs stimulate insulin-like growth factor-I, -II, PDGF and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) in mesangial cells, which in turn mediate production of type IV collagen, laminin and fibronectin (Yamagishi et al., 2007c; Fukami et al., 2004; Yamagishi et al., 2003). AGEs induce TGF-β overexpression in both podocytes and proximal tubular cells as well (Yamagishi et al., 2007c, 2003). Recently, Ziyadeh et al. reported that long-term treatment of type 2 diabetic model mice with blocking antibodies against TGF-β suppressed excess matrix gene expression, glomerulosclerosis, and prevented the development of renal insufficiency (Ziyadeh et al., 2000). These observations suggest that the AGE-induced TGF-β expression plays an important role in the pathogenesis of glomerulosclerosis and tubulointerstitial fibrosis in diabetic nephropathy.

In vivo, administration of AGE-albumin to normal healthy mice for 4 weeks has been found to induce glomerular hypertrophy with overexpression of type IV collagen, laminin B1 and TGF-β genes (Yang et al., 1994). Furthermore, chronic infusion of AGE-albumin to otherwise healthy rats leads to focal glomerulosclerosis, mesangial expansion, and albuminuria (Vlassara et al., 1994). Recently, RAGE-overexpressing diabetic mice have been found to show progressive glomerulosclerosis with renal dysfunction, compared with diabetic littermates lacking the RAGE transgene (Yamamoto et al., 2001). AGEs and RAGE were present to enhanced degrees in the diabetic kidney, and blockade of the AGE-RAGE interaction decreased podocyte VEGF expression and albuminuria, which was associated with decreased numbers of inflammatory cells to, and reduced TGF-β expression, in the glomerulus (Wendt et al., 2003). Furthermore, diabetic homozygous RAGE null mice failed to develop significantly increased mesangial matrix expansion or thickening of the glomerular basement membrane (Wendt et al., 2003). Deletion of RAGE is also reported to prevent diabetic nephropathy in the OVE26 type 1 mouse, a model of progressive glomerulosclerosis and decline of renal function (Reiniger et al., 2010). Taken together, these findings suggest that the activation of AGE-RAGE system contributes to expression of VEGF and enhanced attraction/activation of inflammatory cells in the diabetic glomerulus, thereby setting the stage for mesangial activation and TGF-β production; processes which converge to cause albuminuria and glomerulosclerosis.

AGE formation on extracellular matrix proteins alters both matrix-matrix and cell-matrix interactions, being involved in the pathogenesis of diabetic glomerulosclerosis. For example, non-enzymatic glycation of type IV collagen and laminin reduce their ability to interact with negatively charged proteoglycans, increasing vascular permeability to albumin (Yamagishi et al., 2007). Furthermore, AGE formation on various types of matrix proteins impairs their degradation by matrix metalloproteinases, contributing to basement membrane thickening and mesangial expansion, hallmarks of diabetic nephropathy (Yamagishi et al., 2007c). AGEs including glycoxidation or lipoxidation products such as CML, pentosidine, malondialdehyde-lysine accumulate in the expanded mesangial matrix and thickened glomerular basement membranes of early diabetic nephropathy, and in nodular lesions of advanced disease, thus further suggesting the active involvement of AGEs for diabetic nephropathy (Suzuki et al., 1999).

Galectin-3 is a high-affinity binding protein for AGEs, thus contributing to the elimination of these pathogenic substances (Vlassara et al., 1995). Compared with control wild-type animals, galectin-3-deficient mice developed accelerated glomerulopathy, which was associated with more marked renal CML accumulation, reduced expression of receptors implicated in AGE removal (macrophage scavenger receptor A and AGER1) and increased RAGE expression (Pugliese et al., 2001). These findings suggest that AGE-galectin-3 interaction could protect against the AGE-induced tissue injury in contrast to that through RAGE.

Double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trials of aminoguanidine (Pimagedine®), a prototype therapeutic agent for the prevention of AGE formation, (ACTION; A Clinical Trial In Overt Nephropathy) were designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of aminoguanidine in retarding the rate of progression of renal disease in patients with overt diabetic nephropathy. Pimagedine® therapy reduced the 24-hour total urinary proteinuria and prevented the decrease in glomerular filtration rate and the progression of diabetic retinopathy in patients with type 1 diabetes (Bolton et al., 2004). However, the effects of Pimagedine® on serum creatinine doubling were found not to be significant; serum creatinine doubled in 26% of the placebo-treated patients and in 20% of those who received Pimagedine (p = 0.099). This study is noteworthy in providing the first clinical proof of the concept that inhibiting AGE formation can result in a clinically important attenuation of the serious complication of diabetes. Reported side effects of aminoguanidine in clinical therapy were gastrointestinal disturbance, abnormalities in liver function tests, flu-like symptoms, and a rare vasculitis (Bolton et al., 2004). Further clinical trials of aminoguanidine were terminated due to safety concerns.

In type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients, serum and tissue AGE levels determined by radioreceptor assay, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for CML or fluorescence spectroscopy were significantly increased compared with non-diabetic control subjects (Makita et al., 1991; Galler et al., 2003). Diabetic patients with end-stage renal disease had almost twice as much AGEs in tissue as diabetic patients without renal disease (Makita et al., 1991). Furthermore, we have previously found that non-CML AGEs are increased in parallel to the severity of diabetic nephropathy in type 1 diabetic patients (Miura et al., 2003). AGE-modified collagen levels in the skin are reported to be one of the predictors for diabetic nephropathy and correlated with the severity of nephropathy in patients with long-standing type 1 diabetes as well (Monnier et al., 1999; Genuth et al., 2005).

## 4. Role of AGEs in CVD

AGEs formed on the extracellular matrix results in decreased elasticity of vasculatures, and quench NO, which could mediate defective endothelium-dependent vasodilation in diabetes (Bucala et al., 1991). Indeed, increased oxidative stress generation induced by AGEs inactivates NO to form peroxynitrite. AGE modification of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) exhibits impaired plasma clearance and contributes significantly to increased LDL in vivo, thus being involved in
atherosclerosis (Bucala et al., 1995). Binding of AGEs to RAGE results in generation of intracellular ROS generation and subsequent activation of the redox-sensitive transcription factor NF-κB in vascular wall cells, which promotes the expression of a variety of atherosclerosis-related genes, including ICAM-1, VCAM-1, MCP-1, PAI-1, tissue factor, VEGF, and RAGE (Yamagishi and Imaizumi, 2005; Tanaka et al., 2000).

Bone marrow-derived circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) are critical to vascular repair (Hoenig et al., 2008). Diabetes is associated with endothelial dysfunction, decreased EPC function and mobilization, which could contribute to accelerated atherosclerosis and increased risk for CVD in diabetic patients (Hoenig et al., 2008). AGE-bovine serum albumin enhances apoptosis and suppresses migration and tube formation of late EPCs through the interaction with RAGE via down-regulation of Akt and cyclooxygenase-2 (Chen et al., 2009a). AGEs have also been shown to cause a reduction of length growth and EPC incorporation into the sprouts in association with RAGE overexpression and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation (Scheubel et al., 2006). Furthermore, AGE-modification of vascular substrates impair vascular repair by inhibiting EPC adhesion, spreading and migration via glycation of Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) motif of fibronectin (Bhatwadekar et al., 2008). In addition, C-reactive protein (CRP) has been found to increase oxidative stress generation, alter anti-oxidant defenses, and subsequently induces apoptosis of EPC via RAGE induction (Chen et al., 2009b). These observations suggest that AGE-RAGE axis affects collateral artery formation after myocardial ischemia directly and indirectly by impairing vascular repair and inactivating NO, a mediator of angiogenic signal of VEGF (Murohara et al., 1998). Recently, skin autofluorescence, an established noninvasive measure of AGE accumulation, but not serum pentosidine, was independently associated with low circulating EPCs in subjects with ESRD (Ueno et al., in press).

Further, AGEs have the ability to induce osteoblastic differentiation of microvascular pericytes, which would contribute to the development of vascular calcification in accelerated atherosclerosis in diabetes as well (Yamagishi et al., 1999b). The interaction of the RAS and the AGE–RAGE system in the development of and progression of diabetic vascular complication has also been proposed. The AGE–RAGE interaction augments angiotensin II-induced smooth muscle cell proliferation and activation, thus being involved in accelerated atherosclerosis in diabetes (Shaw et al., 2003).

Smooth muscle cell proliferation, migration, and neointimal expansion upon arterial injury were strikingly suppressed in homozygous RAGE null mice compared with those observed in wild-type littermates (Sakaguchi et al., 2003). These data highlight key roles for RAGE in modulating smooth muscle cell properties after injury and suggest that RAGE is a logical target for suppression of untoward neointimal expansion consequent to arterial injury. Diabetic RAGE(−/−)/apoE(−/−) mice had significantly reduced atherosclerotic plaque area, which is associated with attenuation of leukocyte recruitment, decreased expression of pro-inflammatory mediators, reduced oxidative stress and AGE accumulation (Soro-Paavonen et al., 2008). In addition, AGER1 overexpression in mice protected against wire injury-induced arterial intimal hyperplasia and inflammation by reducing tissue levels of AGEs and oxidative stress (Torreggiani et al., 2009). These observations suggest that AGER1 could counteract oxidative stress generation and activation signaling induced by AGE-RAGE interaction. Taken together, enhancement of expression of these AGE receptors implicated in the removal of AGEs may have beneficial effects on vascular damage in diabetes.

## Food-derived AGEs

Recently, food-derived AGEs are reported to induce oxidative stress and promote inflammatory signals as well (Yamagishi et al., 2007d; Vlassara, 2005). Heat processing of food containing sugars and/or lipids and proteins may generate AGEs (Uribarri et al., 2005;

Goldberg et al., 2004). Nutrient composition, temperature and method of cooking can affect the formation of AGEs in foods; fats or meat-derived products processed by high heat such as broiling and ovenfrying contain more AGEs than carbohydrates boiled for longer periods (Uribarri et al., 2005; Goldberg et al., 2004). That is, in the absence of lipids and proteins or heat, sugar content does not necessarily correlate with AGE values in the food. And, the absence of sugars does not necessarily predict low AGE content, as in preparations containing preformed AGE-like caramel additives (Koschinsky et al., 1997).

### 5.1. Role of food-derived AGEs in vascular complications in diabetic animals

Intake of AGE-rich diet is a major contributor of experimental diabetic nephropathy (Zheng et al., 2002). Compared to the progressive diabetic nephropathy and short survival seen in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice exposed to long-term AGE-rich diets, AGE-poor diet-fed NOD mice developed minimal glomerular pathology and a significantly extended survival, consistent with lower serum and kidney AGEs (Zheng et al., 2002). AGE-poor diet-fed NOD and db/db mice exhibited low expression levels of renal cortex TGF-β, laminin B1 and α1 IV collagen.

Dietary glycotoxins promote diabetic atherosclerosis in apolipoprotein E-deficient mice as well (Lin et al., 2003). An AGE-poor diet that contained four- to five-fold lower AGE contents for 2 months also decreased serum levels of AGEs and markedly reduced tissue AGEs and RAGE expression, numbers of inflammatory cells, tissue factor, VCAM-1, and MCP-1 levels in diabetic apolipoprotein E-deficient mice (Lin et al., 2003).

### 5.2. Role of food-derived AGEs in vascular damage in diabetic and ESRD patients

Recent human studies revealed that about 10% of diet-derived AGEs were absorbed, two-thirds of which remained in the body and only one-third of the absorbed AGEs was excreted into the urine within 3 days from ingestion (Koschinsky et al., 1997; He et al., 1999). Indeed, ingestion of the AGE-rich meal (3-fold higher in AGE content compared with a regular diet) is reported to increase serum levels of AGEs by about 1.5-folds. In diabetic patients, especially those with advanced renal disease, urinary elimination of absorbed food-derived AGEs is markedly impaired and the elevation of serum AGEs persists beyond 48 h post-ingestion (He et al., 1999). These observations suggest that food-derived AGEs play a role in the pathogenesis of vascular complications in diabetes and that inhibition of absorption of dietary AGEs may be a therapeutic target in diabetic patients.

In diabetic patients, diets with 5-fold lower AGE content significantly decreased serum levels of AGEs, soluble VCAM-1 and CRP, compared to equivalent regular diets (Vlassara et al., 2002). AGE-poor diets also reduced peripheral mononuclear cell tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) expression at both mRNA and protein levels (Vlassara et al., 2002). Furthermore, LDL pooled from diabetic patients on a standard diet for 6 weeks (high AGE-LDL) was more glycated and oxidized than that from diabetic patients on an AGE-poor diet (low AGE-LDL) (Cai et al., 2004). High AGE-LDL significantly induced soluble form of VCAM-1 expression in human umbilical vein ECs via redox-sensitive MAPK activation, compared to native LDL or low AGE-LDL (Cai et al., 2004).

In patients with ESRD, serum AGE level correlated significantly with dietary AGE intake, based on either 3-day food records or dietary questionnaires (Uribarri et al., 2003). As the case of healthy subjects and diabetic patients, short-term dietary restriction of AGEs (daily AGE content reduced four- to five-fold) was associated with an average decrease of serum AGE levels by 30–40% (Uribarri et al., 2003).

### 5.3. Role of food-derived AGEs in aging

Aging is associated with increased oxidative stress generation and AGE formation (Cai et al., 2007). A life-long restriction of AGE-containing diet reduces oxidative stress generation and AGE accumulation which are associated with RAGE and p66(shc) suppression, resulting in extension of lifespan in mice (Cai et al., 2007). Oral intake of AGE-containing foods also determines the effects of calorie restriction on oxidative stress, age-related diseases, and lifespan (Cai et al., 2008). These observations suggest that restriction of AGE-rich diet may be a novel therapeutic target for prevention of age-associated various disorders.

The Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging revealed that serum CML, one of the dominant AGEs, was independently associated with CKD and decreased estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in community-dwelling adults (Semba et al., 2010). In a population-based study of aging, the InCHIANTI study, in Tuscany, Italy, plasma CML was also independently associated with CKD and is an independent predictor of decline in renal function in older community-dwelling adults (Semba et al., 2009a). Furthermore, high circulating CML was reported to predict cardiovascular disease mortality among older community-dwelling women (Semba et al., 2009b). Since AGEs induce both oxidative stress and inflammation and accumulate with aging, reduction of dietary-derived AGEs may be a therapeutic target for aging-associated organ damage. However, there is still some controversy over biological effects of food-derived AGEs. It should be noted that there are papers to show that dietary melanoidin could exert anti-oxidative and anti-microbial activity and tumor-suppressive properties in vitro (Tagliazucchi et al., 2010; Rufián-Henares and de la Cueva, 2009; Kamei et al., 1997).

### 6. Conclusion

Formation and accumulation of AGEs play a central role in vascular damage in diabetes. Inhibition of the AGE formation, blockade of the AGE-RAGE system and restriction of food-derived AGEs may become novel therapeutic strategies in vascular complications of diabetes (Figs. 1 and 2).
