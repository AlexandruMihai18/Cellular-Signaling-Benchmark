Schistosomiasis is one of the world’s major neglected tropical diseases. Recent advances in schistosome genomics and transcriptomics have identified components of an intrinsic, B cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2)-regulated apoptotic cell death pathway. Molecular characterization of this pathway demonstrates its similarity to that in mammals. Gene expression and functional data indicate that apoptosis is active throughout the lifecycle. Moreover, drugs that activate apoptosis in human cells kill schistosome cells, raising the prospect of developing new treatments against schistosomiasis of humans. The development of new drugs is increasingly important in the face of the potential for resistance to currently available treatments, and the lack of an effective vaccine.

Schistosomiasis and the need for new treatments  
Parasitic helminth infections afflict >1.5 billion people worldwide, particularly in developing countries, including regions of sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, and the Americas [1]. These worms belong to two phyla: the Nematoda (nematodes or roundworms) and Platyhelminthes, (platyhelminths or flatworms) [1]. Schistosomes are dioecious (see Glossary) platyhelminths with complex life cycles (Box 1) and cause disease in approximately 200 million people, with 300 000 deaths annually, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa [2]. There are three main species of schistosome infecting humans: *Schistosoma mansoni* and *Schistosoma japonicum*, which reside in the portal system of liver and mesenteric arteries, and *Schistosoma haematobium*, which dwells in the vessels of the bladder and/or genital tract [2]. Adult female schistosomes live encopula with males, within a gynaecephoric canal, and are capable of producing hundreds of eggs per day [2]. The eggs are the main contributor to the pathogenesis of schistosomiasis; this is termed ‘egg-induced’ disease [3]. They become entrapped in capillaries and induce the formation of granulomata within the liver, spleen, and/or intestinal wall when produced by *S. mansoni* and *S. japonicum*, or in the urogenital tract when produced by *S. haematobium* [3]. These pathological changes lead to morbidity associated with symptoms such as portal hypertension, splenomegaly, diarrhoea (*S. mansoni* and *S. japonicum*), increased frequency of urination, and haematuria (*S. haematobium*) [2–4]. *S. haematobium* also predisposes to HIV/AIDS and malignant bladder cancer [4].

Currently, there is no effective vaccine to prevent schistosomiasis [5], and treatment is entirely dependent on chemotherapy [6]. Although there are various drugs with efficacy against schistosomes, praziquantel (PZQ) has been the drug of choice since the 1980s because of its safety [6]. However, owing to the strong reliance on PZQ, there is growing concern about the development of resistance, which can be induced in schistosomes in experimentally infected mice [7]. In addition, there is some evidence of PZQ resistance in the field, with low cure-rates being observed following some schistosomiasis outbreaks [8]. Therefore, there has been an ongoing need to develop alternative drugs to combat schistosomiasis.

In the past 5 years complete genomes and transcriptomes of *S. mansoni*, *S. japonicum*, and *S. haematobium* have become publicly available [9–11], providing a wealth of information on the molecular biology of these worms and on potential drug targets. Among the newly identified genes are those involved in apoptosis (Box 2). Because potent small-molecule compounds, particularly in the context of cancer therapy, can successfully target apoptosis pathways in human cells [12–15], this raises the possibility that schistosomes might be similarly targeted. In this review we describe what is currently known about the molecular components of schistosome apoptosis pathways, provide recent insights into the role of apoptosis in schistosome physiology and responses to drug treatments, and indicate the potential of targeting apoptosis pathways in the treatment of schistosomiasis.

Glossary

Ankyrin-repeat domain: a common protein-protein interaction platform assembled with multiple repeats of the ankyrin repeat, which is a 33 amino acid sequence that adopts a helix-loop-helix structure.

Apoptosis: a form of cell death executed in a regulated process by a genetically controlled program (Box 1).

Apoptosome: a ring-like platform formed through the assembly of multiple monomers of APAF-1 in humans, CED-4 in Caenorhabditis elegans, or ARK in Drosophila. This platform enables activation of caspases. Differences in platform symmetry and the requirement for cytochrome c in apoptosome assembly occur in mammals, flies, and worms.

Apoptotic protease-activating factor 1 (APAF-1): a large cytoplasmic adaptor protein that assembles into the apoptosome to enable caspase activation.

Baculovirus IAP repeat (BIR): a zinc-binding domain of approximately 70 amino acids that was first identified through sequence homology to inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAP).

Bax/Bak: proapoptotic proteins that can permeabilize the outer mitochondrial membrane following their activation and oligomerization. The presence of both Bax and Bak is essential for apoptosis signaling to occur in mammals.

B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2): the first-identified pro-survival protein of the intrinsic cell-death pathway.

Bcl-2 homology (BH) domains: regions of sequence homology that define all Bcl-2 proteins. There are four BH domains, known as BH1, BH2, BH3, and BH4, which are each characterized by unique sequence motifs.

BH3-mimetic: a drug that mimics the activity of a BH3-only protein by antagonizing pro-survival proteins to trigger apoptosis. Currently BH3-mimetics are in clinical trials for the treatment of cancer.

BH3-only protein: a proapoptotic protein that is related to other Bcl-2 proteins only by the presence of the BH3 domain, and which initiates the apoptotic cascade.

Blebbing: the formation of irregular bulges in the plasma membrane of a cell, usually brought about when the cytoskeleton separates from the plasma membrane. Blebbing is a hallmark of cells undergoing apoptosis.

Caspase: a cysteine-aspartyl protease that cleaves vital cellular substrates leading to the death of the cell. They can be classified as 'initiators' or 'effectors' caspases.

Caspase-recruitment domain (CARD): an homotypic interaction motif present in proteins typically involved in inflammation and apoptosis that belongs to the death-domain superfamily.

Cercariae: free-swimming forms of the schistosome parasite released from the snail intermediate host.

Death domain (DD): defines a large superfamily of proteins primarily involved in apoptosis and inflammation. There are four main subfamilies based on the homotypic interaction domains present including the death domain (DD), death-effector domain (DED), caspase recruitment domain (CARD), and the pyrin domain (PYD). These domains mediate interactions that allow formation of large signaling complexes.

Death-effector domain (DED): a homotypic interaction motif that belongs to the DD superfamily and is present in proteins found to regulate a variety of cell signaling pathways including apoptosis.

Death-inducing signaling complex (DISC): a ternary assembly comprising the FAS receptor, FADD, and caspase-8 or caspase-10, which is formed upon FasL binding. The DISC activates downstream caspases.

Dioecious: where a species has distinct male and female organisms.

Encopula: pairing of an adult female schistosome with an adult male within the gynaecephoric canal of the male.

Extrinsic apoptosis: apoptosis initiated by binding of extracellular ligands (e.g., TNFα, FasL) to cell-surface death receptors.

FAS receptor: a death receptor, belonging to the tumour necrosis factor receptor superfamily, which contains a cytoplasmic death domain. Binding of its ligand (FasL) induces the formation of the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) and triggers the extrinsic apoptosis pathway.

Gene related to anergy in lymphocytes (GRAIL): a type I transmembrane E3 ligase identified as an early gene that promotes T cell anergy.

Granuloma: a lesion composed of collagen fibres and cells that include CD4+ T cells, eosinophils, and macrophages, that is formed as a result of a CD4+ T cell response to antigens presented by tissue-trapped eggs during chronic schistosome infection.

Homotypic interaction motif: a defined amino acid sequence in a protein that mediates preferential binding to the same motif present in a second protein molecule.

Inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP): a protein that can bind to caspases via its BIR domains and inhibit the activity of the caspases. The IAPs play an additional role in TNFR1 signaling.

Intrinsic apoptosis: apoptosis regulated and mediated by the Bcl-2 family of proteins in response to cellular stresses. It is otherwise known as the mitochondrial or stress-induced pathway to apoptosis.

Mitochondrial outer-membrane permeabilization (MOMP): activation and oligomerization of proapoptotic Bax/Bak leads to MOMP, which enables

soluble proteins, such as cytochrome c, to diffuse from the intermembrane space of the mitochondria into the cytosol.

Percutaneous infection: occurs when the free-living water-borne stage of the schistosome life-cycle, known as cercariae, penetrate human skin and transform into schistosomulae.

Praziquantel (PZQ): an orally administered antihelmintic which is the most widely used drug for treatment of schistosomiasis. The mechanism-of-action of PZQ is not well-defined but likely involves the induction of calcium uptake and apoptosis in schistosomes.

Really interesting new gene (RING) finger domain: a type of zinc finger defined by a consensus sequence of approximately 40–60 amino acids that includes cysteines and histidines as the zinc-binding residues.

Schistosomula: an immature form of the schistosome parasite that appears once the cercariae penetrate through the skin and lose their 'tails'.

Second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases (SMAC)-mimetic: a drug that mimics the activity of natural antagonists of the IAP proteins, resulting in apoptosis and inactivation of the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) survival signaling pathway.

Th1/Th2 cell response: CD4+ T helper cell responses based on cytokine secretion profiles. Th1 cells produce interferon-γ, IL-2, and TNFα, whereas Th2 cells produce IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, and IL-13. The different cytokines affect different classes of blood cells, resulting in different immune system responses.

Tumour necrosis family receptor 1 (TNFR1): a member of the TNFR super-family that contains a cytoplasmic death domain. It serves as the main receptor for TNF-α and plays roles in apoptosis and NF-κB activation.

Vitellarium: a dedicated organ in schistosomes that is required for the production of yolk cells that surround a fertilized egg.

WD40 domain: a protein interaction domain made up of WD40 repeats (~40 amino acid motifs often terminating in a Trp-Asp (W-D) dipeptide) that together form a β-propeller architecture, and acts as an interacting platform for binding partners.

to apoptosis signaling, namely the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways [16,17]. Recently, all of the major components of an intrinsic cell-death pathway have been characterized in schistosomes [18,19].

**Bcl-2 family proteins in schistosomes**

The intrinsic apoptosis pathway is activated by developmental cues, cytotoxic insults, or stresses (e.g., DNA damage, growth factor deprivation). Proteins of the Bcl-2 family are the key regulators of this pathway (Figure 1) [17]. They are defined by the presence of at least one of four Bcl-2 homology (BH) domains (BH1 to BH4) and comprise three subgroups of proteins that promote either cell survival or death. In mammals, there are five members of the pro-survival subgroup, including Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Bcl-w, Mcl-1, and Bfl-1, which prevent activation of the essential mediators of cell death, Bax and Bak. Both pro-survival proteins and Bax/Bak contain at least three BH domains. The pro-survival proteins inhibit Bax/Bak activation, either by binding to them directly [20–22] and/or by sequestering another subgroup of the family, the BH3-only proteins [23,24]. The BH3-only proteins are upregulated or activated when a cell receives a death stimulus, and initiate the apoptotic cascade. Once activated, Bax/Bak oligomerize, forming pore-like structures in the outer mitochondrial membrane, leading to its permeabilization. The puncturing of the mitochondria releases apoptogenic factors, such as cytochrome c, which interact with the adaptor protein, apoptotic protease-activating factor 1 (APAF-1). APAF-1 forms an oligomeric platform, termed the apoptosome, which enables the activation of caspases, the proteolytic enzymes responsible for dismantling the cell [25].

The recent identification and characterization of the Bcl-2 family and related proteins in schistosomes [18,19,26] provided the first molecular evidence of an intrinsic apoptosis pathway in parasitic flatworms. Bioinformatic analyses of genome databases representing schistosomes

Box 1. Schistosome life cycle

Adult schistosomes, also known as blood flukes, are approximately 10mm in length and are dioecious. The life cycle is complex, involving an aquatic snail as an intermediate host. Eggs produced by adult females leave the human host in excreta. After contact with water, miracidia hatch and actively penetrate the snail host, where they asexually replicate within 4–6 weeks. The cercariae are released, find a host, and then penetrate the skin of the host. In humans, they lose their 'tails' and migrate, as schistosomula, from the skin to the bloodstream, through the heart and lungs, to the liver, where they reside and mature for 4–6 weeks. The worms then migrate to mesenteric veins, where they become established and produce eggs that can either become trapped in tissues, leading to pathology, or are excreted and enter waterways to recommence the life cycle.

[9–11,27] show that these parasites possess several multi-BH domain-containing proteins, for instance Bcl-2-and Bax/Bak-like, as well as single BH domain-containing proteins, such as BH3-only proteins, similar to those of mammals. However schistosomes have fewer Bcl-2 proteins (Figure 2) including: (i) a pro-survival Bcl-2-like protein (sBcl-2); (ii) a Bak/Bax-like protein (sBak), which can elicit cytochrome c release from mitochondria when expressed in mammalian cells and is inhibited by sBcl-2; (iii) and a BH3-only protein (sBH3-1), which can antagonize interactions between sBcl-2 and sBak [19,28–31]. In addition, another multi-BH domain-containing protein (sBcl-2-2) has been identified, although its function is presently unknown. This protein is unusual compared with mammalian Bcl-2 proteins owing to an extended N-terminal domain of ~500 residues. Only Mcl-1 in mammalian cells possesses an extended N terminus of ~150 residues, which regulates protein stability; however, the role of the corresponding region in sBcl-2-2 remains unknown. Schistosomes also possess a protein with a single BH1 domain (sBH1). No similar protein exists in mammals, although some viral Bcl-2 proteins lack any obvious BH domain sequences but have 3D structures similar to mammalian Bcl-2 proteins [32,33].

Interestingly, the schistosome Bcl-2 pathway is fundamentally different from that of roundworms, such as *Caenorhabditis elegans*, which lack a Bax/Bak-like protein (Figure 1). Instead, the *C. elegans* pro-survival protein (CED-9) interacts directly with the APAF-1 homologue CED-4 to prevent caspase activation [34]. Indeed, in all of the taxa, including the Porifera, Cnidaria, Nematoda, Platyhelminthes, Arthropoda, and Echinodermata [35], for which Bcl-2 proteins have been described, only the Platyhelminthes, including free-living and parasitic flatworms, are currently known to require mitochondrial outer-membrane permeabilization (MOMP) for apoptosis signalling [36,37].

Schistosome caspases

The morphological features of apoptotic cells are a result of the activity of caspases which are cysteine-dependent aspartate-specific proteases [38]. There are two classes of caspases: (i) initiator caspases, identified by an extended N terminus containing homotypic interaction motifs, such as the caspase-recruitment domain (CARD) and the death-effector domain (DED), and (ii) effector caspases, which usually contain a shorter pro-domain sequence. In mammals, the

Box 2. Apoptosis

Apoptosis is a fundamental cellular process required for the development and survival of all multicellular organisms. Its name derives from the Greek language – the ‘falling of leaves’ – owing to the small, membrane-enclosed buds or ‘apoptotic bodies’ that are released from cells in the throes of death. Unlike necrosis, where a cell dies in response to some trauma or damage leading to its rupture and release of its inflammation-causing contents, apoptosis occurs via a genetically programmed mechanism where the contents are dismantled by enzymes in an orderly fashion, and are packaged into the apoptotic bodies. The apoptotic bodies are rapidly engulfed by phagocytes are and removed without provoking an inflammatory response. Classical hallmarks of apoptotic cells include membrane blebbing, chromatin condensation, chromosomal DNA fragmentation, and apoptotic body release. Apoptosis occurs during embryonic development to sculpt various tissues and in response to numerous stresses such as viral infection and DNA damage. Defective apoptosis is a hallmark of most cancers, which acquire genetic defects that promote cell survival, for example, mutations or chromosomal translocations that lead to increased expression of Bcl-2 pro-survival proteins, and which prevent rogue, damaged cells from being killed and removed. As such, there is enormous interest in the development of drugs that can trigger apoptosis in cancer cells. Indeed, this is the mechanism by which most cancer chemotherapies and other cancer treatment regimens work.

enzymatic cascade begins when inactive initiator caspase monomers are brought into close proximity by activation platforms such as the apoptosome. The resultant dimerization of initiator caspases, in turn, enables activation of effector caspases through cleavage events [39].

In schistosomes, four caspases have been described [18,19,40]. CaspD contains an N-terminal CARD domain, suggesting that it is an initiator caspase. This caspase shows homology to caspase-2 and caspase-9 (human initiator caspases), but its substrate specificity remains to be determined. sCasp3 and sCasp7 are homologues of the human effector caspases, caspase-3 and caspase-7, respectively. CaspC is a homologue of human caspase-8, but, interestingly, contains an ankyrin-repeat domain, which is a protein–protein interaction module [41], instead of a canonical DED at its N terminus [19]. To date, a similar caspase with an ankyrin-repeat module has not been reported, raising questions as to the mechanism(s) of its regulation and the possibility of an alternative, unknown pathway to apoptosis in schistosomes. Although caspase activity is detected in different developmental stages of schistosomes [18,42,43], further work is necessary to establish the mechanisms by which caspases are regulated in flatworms and to assess whether they represent prospective drug targets.

The schistosome apoptosome

Caspase activation requires interactions with an adaptor protein that assembles into a scaffold termed the apoptosome. In mammals, APAF-1 forms a heptameric scaffold, which requires cytochrome c released from the mitochondria following MOMP for its assembly [25]. Cytochrome c binds to APAF-1 via WD40 (~40 amino acid motifs often terminating in a Trp–Asp (W–D) dipeptide) domains at its C terminus. In *C. elegans*, the APAF-1 homologue, CED-4, forms an octameric complex that does not require cytochrome c [44], consistent with the absence of MOMP in

Figure 1. Cell death pathways in different organisms. Various mechanisms for mediating and regulating apoptotic cell death have been described. In mammals, there is an extrinsic pathway and an intrinsic pathway of apoptosis that converge on the activation of caspases. Members of the death receptor superfamily trigger the extrinsic pathway upon ligand binding at the cell surface [16]. This binding event results in formation of the DISC, which in turn recruits and activates downstream caspases. The Bcl-2 family of proteins regulate the intrinsic pathway [17]. Pro-survival Bcl-2 proteins prevent apoptosis by binding to upstream proapoptotic BH3-only proteins or downstream Bak/Bax proteins. Receipt of a death stimulus leads to activation of Bak/Bax that oligomerizes, resulting in mitochondrial outer-membrane permeabilization (MOMP). Apoptogenic factors such as cytochrome c are released from the mitochondria and activate the adaptor protein, APAF-1, which assembles into an oligomeric scaffold that recruits and activates caspases. In *Caenorhabditis elegans*, the Bcl-2 pathway is unique; the pro-survival protein CED-9 inhibits CED-4, an APAF-1-like molecule, rather than Bak/Bax which are absent in *C. elegans* [44]. The pathway is triggered by the BH3-only protein EGL-1. In *Drosophila*, the IAP proteins (e.g., DIAP1) play the central role in regulating apoptosis by directly inhibiting the caspases, such as DRONC and DrICE, whereas the Bcl-2 family members (Buffy and Debcl) are only minor players. ARK is the APAF-1 homologue in *Drosophila* and, unlike in mammals, cytochrome c and hence MOMP are not required for its activation [94]. Schistosome cell-death regulation is via an intrinsic apoptosis pathway that is regulated similarly to that in mammals [19]. There is apparently is no extrinsic pathway to apoptosis in schistosomes. The broken box indicates events where the exact molecular details require further investigation. Abbreviations: APAF-1, apoptotic protease-activating factor-1; ARK, APAF-1 related killer.

nematodes and the lack of WD40 domains in CED-4. By contrast, the schistosome APAF-1 homologue possesses WD40 domains in its C terminus, consistent with the requirement for cytochrome c for its assembly into an apoptosome, and the presence of a Bax/Bak molecule within its apoptotic pathway to mediate MOMP. However, no detailed information on how this scaffold assembles is currently available.

### Schistosome inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs)

Once activated, caspases can be inhibited by the IAP family of proteins, characterized by the presence of baculovirus IAP repeat (BIR) domains [45]. These domains serve as protein interaction surfaces, through which IAPs bind their partners, including caspases. In mammals, genetic ablation of the IAPs results in no obvious phenotype, suggesting that they are not crucial in apoptotic control [46–49]. Instead, these proteins are important regulators of other cellular pathways, such as in NF-κB signalling and the formation of the ripoptosome, a large necroptosis signalling platform [50]. Nevertheless, the IAPs do show prominence in *Drosophila melanogaster*, where a loss-of-function mutant of DIAP1 leads to spontaneous caspase-mediated apoptosis and embryonic lethality [51].

An IAP from *S. japonicum*, designated SjIAP, with a single BIR domain, inhibits caspase activity in adult worm lysates and in transfected mammalian cells [43]. This protein is most highly expressed in parasitic stages within a definitive rabbit host; however, the extent to which the apoptotic program of schistosomes relies on the IAPs versus the Bcl-2 proteins remains to be determined. Notably, apoptosis-regulatory IAPs possess a well-defined RING finger domain in their C termini, which is not present in SjIAP. This raises a question about whether SjIAP is involved in regulating apoptosis, or whether it is involved in the other cellular pathways in which mammalian IAPs are known to be involved [45].

### Are other proteins involved in schistosome apoptosis?

Another gene encoding a cytokine-induced apoptosis inhibitor, SjCIAP, has been identified in schistosomes [52]. SjCIAP shares no relation to other IAP proteins; however,

Evidence for apoptosis signalling in schistosomes

Although the hallmarks of apoptosis activation in cells, for example, caspase activation, DNA fragmentation, and membrane blebbing, can be studied without knowledge of the molecular components involved, there was essentially no detailed analysis of cell death in schistosomes until recently. These latest reports have shown that apoptosis is active, at varying levels in different life-cycle stages. Indeed, gene transcription data acquired for a range of genes associated with apoptosis throughout *S. japonicum* development in mice showed that various pro- and antiapoptotic genes are up- and/or downregulated, whereas others are maintained throughout the life cycle [18]. In addition, TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end-labelling) staining, a method for detecting DNA fragmentation (a hallmark of apoptosis), demonstrated that apoptosis occurs in 14 day post-infection *S. japonicum* schistosomula [18]. Cells derived from these and more mature schistosomula stained positive for annexin V and propidium iodide, other markers for apoptotic cells. In addition, caspase activity is highest in schistosomula versus adults of *S. japonicum*, and in male versus female worms [18]. Interestingly, IAP activity increases as this parasite matures [43]. Although not yet explored, it is tempting to speculate that the morphological changes during the schistosome life cycle depend on apoptosis, which is the case in the development of other animals [60].

Microarray analysis of schistosomula originating from the non-permissive host *Microtus fortis*, compared to those from BALB/c mice, showed increased transcription of pro-apoptotic genes, such as caspases, but decreased expression of *iap* and *bcl-2*, both of which are antiapoptotic genes [42]. These findings were associated with increased caspase activity and higher levels of apoptotic cells in schistosomula from *M. fortis*. Because *S. japonicum* does not develop to maturity in *M. fortis* or give rise to egg-induced disease, which it does in mice, these findings suggest that strategies to induce apoptosis selectively in schistosomes might be effective for the treatment of schistosomiasis.

Another study focused on the role of apoptosis in egg production in *S. mansoni* [61]. The sexual maturation of female worms involves the development of the vitellarium, which contributes crucial cells and components to the egg. This tissue does not develop in virgin females and regresses in adult females if they are removed from their male partners. The vitellarium reduces in size and structure in females maintained in culture, and the reduction is associated with a decreased capacity to produce eggs [61]. These virgin, unpaired worms all display significant increases in TUNEL-positive cells, which are almost exclusively associated with the vitellarium [61]. No difference in the proliferation rate of cells within the vitellarium was recorded between paired and unpaired females *in vivo* or *in vitro* [61]. Collectively, this information suggests that particular factors from the male schistosome and the definitive host are crucial for cell survival in the vitellarium, and that apoptosis leads to regression of this tissue in female schistosomes.

Induction of apoptosis by PZQ

Although PZQ has been the drug of choice for the treatment of schistosomiasis for several decades, surprisingly,

its mechanism of action is still poorly understood, and little is known about its differential activity on mature versus juvenile parasites [6,62,63]. However, PZQ can induce calcium uptake in schistosomes [64]. Intracellular calcium plays an important role in regulating apoptosis [65]. Interestingly, morphological changes of cells associated with apoptosis, including blebbing, are observed following PZQ treatment of adult [66,67] but not juvenile worms [68]. Consistent with this observation is a recent report showing that the transcription patterns of many genes change following PZQ treatment of *S. mansoni*, including downregulation of antiapoptotic and upregulation of proapoptotic genes [68]. Hence, even though PZQ likely affects many cellular processes, its lethal effect on mature worms possibly involves its ability to induce apoptosis in schistosome cells.

Apoptosis in host–parasite interactions

Immunomodulation is an important feature of schistosome infections, with human host immune responses switching from a T helper cell type 1 (Th1) response during the early stages of infection, 3–5 weeks after infection, to a Th2 response following egg deposition and granuloma formation in host tissues [69,70]. The Th2 response then declines during the latter, chronic stages of infection [71]). The induction of apoptosis in cells of the human host by schistosomes is associated with several stages of the immune response. For example, in the early stage of percutaneous infection, skin-stage schistosomula of *S. mansoni* secrete a 23 kDa proapoptotic protein, which can induce apoptosis in skin T cells through upregulation of FasL [72]. Soluble egg antigens (SEA) can also induce T cell apoptosis [73,74], and this is particularly important in the formation of granulomas [74]. Again, upregulation of FasL has been recorded, particularly on CD4⁺ T cells in response to SEA, with cell death being mediated by B lymphocytes [74,75]. In addition, the switch from a Th1 to a Th2 response is associated with apoptosis, with significant death of CD8⁺ cytotoxic T cells (Tc1 cells) occurring during the acute phase of *S. mansoni* infection [76]. Interestingly, the decline in the Th2 cell population during chronic infection is not due to increased Th cell apoptosis, as was originally shown [77,78]; rather, it is due to an increased expression of GRAIL (gene related to anergy in lymphocytes), which is important in T cell hyporesponsiveness [79]. Hence, whereas apoptosis within schistosomes influences their own physiology, their ability to induce apoptosis in cells of the human host is crucial for worm survival and the pathological consequences in this host.

Targeting apoptosis pathways in schistosomes

The heavy reliance on PZQ for the treatment of schistosomiasis has led to concerns about the development of resistance in worms [6,8,76]. Thus, there is a growing need to identify new drug targets, including proteins involved in apoptosis, for the development of alternative compounds.

Drugs that directly target the apoptotic machinery

Various drugs engage human Bcl-2 pro-survival proteins with high affinity and trigger apoptosis in cancer cells [13,14,80]. Two of these compounds, ABT-263 and

![Figure 3](#fig3)

**Figure 3.** The schistosome pro-survival protein structurally resembles its mammalian counterparts. The crystal structure of sBcl-2 (left panel) demonstrated that it adopts a typical Bcl-2 helical bundle [19] (as seen in Bcl-x<sub>L</sub>, centre panel [83]) that displays a conserved hydrophobic groove into which the BH3 (Bcl-2 homology) domain (pink or green helix in left and centre panels) from proapoptotic proteins (such as Bak) binds. Importantly, the same groove that is targeted by BH3 domains to trigger the apoptotic cascade is similarly targeted by small-molecule compounds known as BH3-mimetics such as ABT-737 (right panel, green compound) [81]. This observation stimulates the proposal that BH3-mimetics against the schistosome pro-survival protein can be targeted in the same way, triggering cell death in the parasite.

ABT-199, are now undergoing clinical trials for the treatment of leukaemia and lymphoma [13,14]. These molecules, termed BH3-mimetics, mimic the action of BH3 domains from BH3-only proteins [81]. ABT-737, a BH3-mimetic that preceded the development of ABT-263, can bind to the schistosome Bcl-2 pro-survival protein [12], albeit with ~100-fold weaker affinity than for human Bcl-2 proteins [19]. A crystal structure of sBcl-2 bound to a peptidic BH3 domain ligand indicates the same mode of interaction as for human Bcl-2 proteins with similar peptides [19,82–84] (Figure 3). These findings point to the potential of BH3-mimetics targeting Bcl-2 proteins to trigger apoptosis in schistosomes. Ultimately, such compounds would need to display selectivity for sBcl-2 over its human homologues. We propose that selectivity will be achievable, given that BH3-mimetics with selectivity for human pro-survival proteins have been developed; these molecules display a higher degree of sequence homology to each other than to sBcl-2 (e.g., WEHI-539 is specific for Bcl-x<sub>L</sub>, whereas ABT-199 only targets Bcl-2) [13,80]. In addition, a study of sBcl-2 binding to a range of BH3 domain peptides indicated a unique interaction profile [19], suggestive of a distinctive ligand-binding site for selective BH3-mimetic drugs in the schistosome pro-survival protein.

Recently, another class of anticancer drugs known as SMAC (second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases)-mimetics have been developed [45]. SMAC is released from mitochondria during apoptotic responses, and can bind to IAPs, inhibiting their ability to engage caspases and thereby promoting cell death. In cancer therapy, SMAC-mimetics function through the TNFR1 signalling pathway by promoting the degradation of cIAP, leading to the induction of apoptosis in tumour cells [45]. Because schistosomes do not possess a TNFR1 death-signaling pathway, SMAC-mimetics would not be able to induce death of schistosomes in the same way. Nevertheless, it is plausible that they could potentiate apoptosis signalling by disrupting the capacity of IAPs to inhibit caspases. This hypothesis should be tested.

A third class of compounds that directly induce apoptosis bind to Bax, triggering the conformational change that results in mitochondrial pore formation [85]. Although still in the early stages of development, this evidence encourages the design of similar-acting compounds to activate the schistosome Bax/Bak protein and promote apoptosis in the parasite. Importantly, there are significant differences in the parasite versus human Bax/Bak protein sequences, suggesting that sufficient selectivity for schistosomes could be achieved to prevent unwanted apoptosis in host cells.

**Drugs that indirectly activate the apoptotic machinery**

Although BH3- and SMAC-mimetics directly target components of the apoptotic pathways, it has also been suggested that compounds that can indirectly trigger apoptosis in schistosomes might ultimately prove useful for treating schistosomiasis [86–89]. Most prominent among these are compounds acting on histone-modifying enzymes (HME), including histone deacetylases (HDAC), histone acetyltransferases (HAT), and sirtuins. Currently, HDAC inhibitors are in use or clinical trials for the treatment of cancer, and can kill cancer cells by inducing apoptosis [90]. HDAC inhibitors also induce apoptosis in vitro in schistosomula and adult worms of *S. mansoni* [87,88,91]. Similar results have been achieved with the sirtuin inhibitor, sirtinol [88]. Owing to these promising results, a European Commission-funded project (SET-TReND – Schistosome Epigenetics: Targets, Regulation, New Drugs) has been established to extensively evaluate schistosome histone-modifying enzymes as drug targets [88]. A major consideration will be whether schistosome selectivity can be achieved for such compounds. In this regard, sequence differences between the catalytic domains of Sm-HDAC8, Sm-Sirt1, and Sm-Sirt2 and those of their mammalian homologues might be exploited [88,91,92].

In addition to HME inhibitors, kinase inhibitors that can induce apoptosis are being evaluated as drugs against schistosomes. One such target is the schistosome insulin receptor and related tyrosine kinases [89]. Compounds such as AG1024, which inhibit these kinases, indirectly induce apoptosis in schistosomula of *S. mansoni* and profoundly influence worm-pairing and egg-laying capacities, with significant effects on reproductive tissues [89].

Review

Box 3. Outstanding questions

- What are the functions of sBcl-2-2 and sBH1 within the Bcl-2-regulated apoptotic pathway in schistosomes?
- Does the schistosome inhibitor of apoptosis protein play a dominant role in controlling apoptosis, as is the case in *Drosophila*? Or will it be more like the role of IAP proteins in mammals?
- How are caspases regulated in schistosomes?
- Are mitochondrial outer-membrane permeabilization (MOMP) and the release of cytochrome c essential for the formation of a schistosome apoptosome, such as that seen in mammals? Or is MOMP not required, as in *Caenorhabditis elegans*?
- Drugs such as PZQ, which indirectly activate apoptosis, are effective against schistosomiasis. Will drugs, such as BH3-mimetics and SMAC-mimetics, which directly activate apoptosis, also be effective?
- Can schistosome-specific drugs targeting cell death components be developed?

(Gleevec), another tyrosine kinase inhibitor used for cancer treatment also acts by inducing apoptosis in tumour cells, and has been shown to kill *S. mansoni* via the induction of apoptosis in reproductive tissues [93]. Hence, targeting kinases to induce apoptosis might be a fruitful avenue to killing schistosomes [86].

### Concluding remarks and future perspectives

The past 5 years have seen an upsurge in our knowledge of the role and importance of apoptosis in schistosomes. Although genomic, transcriptomic and gene expression studies, as well as functional studies, have provided a sound understanding of some molecular components of the intrinsic cell-death pathway in schistosomes, there are still major gaps in our knowledge of this pathway (Figure 1, Box 3). For example, we know nothing about the function of some Bcl-2 proteins such as sBcl-2-2 and sBH1. Moreover, the role of IAP remains enigmatic, given that there is strong evidence that schistosomes do not possess an extrinsic apoptosis pathway. Furthermore, the precise mechanism(s) by which caspases are activated is/are still not fully understood. Another crucial question is whether strategies that selectively induce apoptosis in schistosome cells will provide a basis for the development of new drugs to treat human schistosomiasis. Although current findings indicate that molecules, which both directly (BH3-mimetics) or indirectly (HDAC and kinase inhibitors) induce apoptosis show promise, it will be imperative for these compounds to be assessed in detail and advanced in terms of their potency and selectivity over human homologues. Moreover, although evidence that these types of compounds can kill parasites *in vivo* is still lacking, the present review highlights the considerable promise that they might represent alternatives to PZQ in the future.
