Transport systems for C₄-dicarboxylates, such as malate, fumarate and succinate, are poorly understood in Gram-positive bacteria. The whole genome sequence of *Bacillus subtilis* revealed two genes, *ydbE* and *ydbH*, whose deduced products are highly homologous to binding proteins and transporters for C₄-dicarboxylates in Gram-negative bacteria. Between *ydbE* and *ydbH*, genes *ydbF* and *ydbG* encoding a sensor-regulator pair, were located. Inactivation of each one of the *ydbEFGH* genes caused a deficiency in utilization of fumarate or succinate but not of malate. Expression of *ydbH*, encoding a putative transporter, was stimulated in a minimal salt medium containing 0·05% yeast extract but repressed by the addition of malate to the medium. Inactivation of the putative sensor-regulator pair or solute-binding protein, *ydbFG* or *ydbE*, caused complete loss of *ydbH* expression. The utilization of fumarate and stimulation of *ydbH* expression resumed in a *ydbE* null mutant in which *ydbFGH* were overproduced. Based on these observations, together with analysis of the sequence similarities of the deduced product, we conclude that YdbH is a C₄-dicarboxylate-transport protein and its expression is regulated by a C₄-dicarboxylate sensor kinase-regulator pair, YdbF and YdbG. Furthermore, it is suggested that YdbE does not directly participate in transport of C₄-dicarboxylates, but plays a sensory role in the *ydbF-ydbG* two-component system, giving rise to specificity or increased efficiency to the system. Deletion analysis of the promoter region of *ydbH* revealed that a direct repeat sequence was required for the activation of *ydbH* expression. A catabolite-responsive element (CRE) was also found in the –10 region of the promoter, suggesting negative regulation by a CRE-binding protein.

INTRODUCTION

*Bacillus subtilis* has a complete set of enzymes for the TCA cycle and can grow on most of the TCA cycle intermediates as sole carbon sources (Fortnagel & Freese, 1968; Kunst *et al.*, 1997). However, genes for uptake of the carboxylic acid intermediates and the regulation of their expression are not known in *B. subtilis*, except for citrate. *B. subtilis* has two transporters for citrate, CitM and CitH (encoded by the *xyiQ* gene) (Carlsson & Hederstedt, 1987; Boorsma *et al.*, 1996); the expression of CitM is regulated by a two-component sensor-regulator pair, CitS and CitT (Yamamoto *et al.*, 1999). As for C₄-dicarboxylates such as malate, fumarate and succinate, previous studies suggested the existence of active transporters (Fournier & Pardee, 1974; Willecke & Lange, 1974; Ghei & Kay, 1975). It was also suggested that at least two transport systems for malate were induced in *B. subtilis* (Willecke & Lange, 1974). The first system which was required for transport of malate, fumarate and succinate was induced in NYE medium (yeast extract in the medium was supposed to contain a small amount of malate). The second system, probably specific for malate, was further induced by the addition of a large amount of malate.

Abbreviation: Dct, dicarboxylic acid transport.

See detail in the text. (b) Northern blots using gene-specific probes. Total RNA was prepared from a *B. subtilis* 168 culture growing in DS medium when the OD$_{600}$ reached 0·1 (lanes 1), 0·3 (lanes 2) or 0·6 (lanes 3). The approximate positions of transcripts are indicated as Tx. The size of RNA is shown on the left of the blots.

However, $C_4$-dicarboxylate transport systems in *B. subtilis* have not been studied genetically.

Several classes of $C_4$-dicarboxylate transport (Dct) systems have been reported in Gram-negative bacteria. In *Escherichia coli*, uptake of $C_4$-dicarboxylates is achieved by the aerobic DctA system and the anaerobic DcuA, DcuB and DcuC systems, where DcuA and DcuB are homologous proteins (Six et al., 1994; Zientz et al., 1999). In *Rhizobium leguminosarum* and *Rhizobium meliloti*, $C_4$-dicarboxylates are required for symbiotic nitrogen fixation and are transported by the DctA permease homologous to *E. coli* DctA (Finan et al., 1983; Engelke et al., 1987; Ronson et al., 1987; Six et al., 1994; Sofia et al., 1994). The purple photosynthetic bacterium *Rhodobacter capsulatus* has a Dct system which consists of three proteins: $C_4$-dicarboxylate periplasmic binding protein, DctP, and two integral membrane proteins, DctQ and DctM (Shaw et al., 1991; Forward et al., 1997). Furthermore, it has been shown that expression of many of the genes encoding Dct systems is positively regulated by two-component systems in response to exogenous $C_4$-dicarboxylates. The Rhi. leguminosarum and Rhi. meliloti *dctA* genes are activated by the adjacent two-component gene sets *dctB* and *dctD* (Jording et al., 1992; Reid & Poole, 1998). In Rho. *capsulatus*, the *dctP*, *dctQ* and *dctM* genes form an operon and are regulated by the adjacent *dctS* and *dstR* genes, which code for a two-component sensor-regulator pair (Hamblin et al., 1993). Recently, it

was also reported that a two-component regulatory system, DcuS and DcuR, is responsible for the activation of the *E. coli* *dcuB* and *fumB* genes encoding the anaerobic fumarate carrier and fumarase, which are located next to the *dcuSR* genes (Zientz et al., 1998; Golby et al., 1999).

In the framework of the *B. subtilis* genome-sequencing project (Kunst et al., 1997), our group had sequenced a 150 kb region between the *pbpC* and *phoB* genes, and identified two genes, *ydbE* and *ydbH*, whose products were similar to DctP in *Rho. capsulatus* and DctA in *Rhi. leguminosarum*, respectively (Fig. 1). The deduced products of *ydbE* and *ydbH* exhibited 41·2 and 53·9 % amino acid sequence identity to the corresponding proteins, respectively. In addition, as in the case of Gram-negative bacteria, *ydbF* and *ydbG*, which were thought to code for a sensor kinase and response regulator, respectively, were located between *ydbE* and *ydbH* (Fig. 1). The deduced products, the YdbF and YdbG proteins, have significant similarity to *E. coli* DcuS and DcuR (30·6 % and 35·3 % identity, respectively). Furthermore, no other genes encoding close homologues of the reported genes involved in $C_4$-dicarboxylate transport in Gram-negative bacteria could be identified in the whole *B. subtilis* genome sequence. These analyses led us to hypothesize that the *B. subtilis* *ydbEFGH* genes encode the $C_4$-dicarboxylate transport and its regulatory systems. Indeed, the studies described here reveal that the *ydbH* gene encodes a $C_4$-dicarboxyl-

ate transporter and the *ydbFG* two-component genes are necessary for the activation of *ydbH* expression. An unexpected finding is that the YdbE protein is not directly involved in C₄-dicarboxylate uptake, but is necessary for *ydbH* expression in concert with the YdbFG two-component system.

**METHODS**

**Bacterial strains and growth media.** *Bacillus subtilis* 168 (*trpC2*) was used as a parental strain to construct mutants. A sporulation medium (DS medium, Schaeffer *et al.*, 1965) and a minimal salts medium containing 0·05% (w/v) yeast extract (NYE medium, Willecke & Lange, 1974) were used as described previously. To monitor the utilization of C₄-dicarboxylates as carbon sources by *B. subtilis*, malate, fumarate or succinate was added at a final concentration of 0·5% (w/v) when the OD~600~ of cells growing in NYE medium reached 0·1.

**Transformation.** Transformation of *B. subtilis* was performed as described by Kawamura *et al.* (1980).

**Construction of pMUTINT3 insertion mutants.** Oligonucleotide primers dbEF (5′-CGAGGCAGATCTGTCTCGCACTGATGATCG-3′) and dbER (5′-CGAGGCAGATCTCGAGCTTCGATGGGAGGG-3′), dbFF (5′-CGAGGCAGATCTGCTCAATCCGTTGGAAAATCACG-3′) and dbFR (5′-CGAGGCAGATCTCTCGAGCTTGTGCTGACAGGATGC-3′), dbHF (5′-CGAGGCAGATCTTAGTTGAGGTCATAACC GC-3′) and dbHR (5′-CGAGGCAGATCTCGAGCATCAACCATGTTGGACG-3′), and dbGF (5′-CGAGGCGGATCCGCTCGTAAAGAATGGAAAGGT-TCTGCTATTG-3′) and dbGR (5′-CGAGGCGGATCTCGTGCAAGGTC-CTCGAGCTGATCTCCTGCAAGGTC-3′) were used to amplify 320, 304, 398 and 218 bp segments of *ydbE*, *ydbF*, *ydbH* and *ydbG* internal regions, respectively, from *B. subtilis* 168 genomic DNA. Each PCR product was restricted at the BglII or BamHI sites in the primers and inserted into BamHI-restricted pMUTINT3 (Moriya *et al.*, 1998; Vagner *et al.*, 1998). The resulting plasmids were introduced into the *B. subtilis* genome and integrated by a single crossover, with selection of the transformants by means of erythromycin resistance (0·5 μg erythromycin ml⁻¹), to give the pMUTINT3-inserted mutants. The correct integration of pMUTINT3 was confirmed by Southern hybridization.

**Construction of tet-insertion mutants.** The *ydbE* gene was inactivated by replacing its central portion with a tetracycline-resistance gene. The upstream region of *ydbE* was amplified with the primers dbEUF (5′-AAGAAGCTTCATTAATCATCCTGAT-3′) and dbEUR (5′-TCATAAATATGTATAGCA-GAGCTCTCTAGAGGCCTTCCTGGTCGT CATC-3′), generating a 484 bp fragment with flanking HindIII and SacI sites. The downstream region of *ydbE* was amplified with the primers dbEDF (5′-GATGACGACCAGGAAGGCC TC-TAGAGAGAGCTCTGCTATACATATTTATGA-3′) and dbEDR (5′-GAAGAATTCCTCAGTTGCCGTATCCAT-3′) generating a 466 bp fragment with flanking SacI and EcoRI sites. HindIII/SacI-digested upstream fragment and SacI/EcoRI-digested downstream fragment were cloned into HindIII/EcoRI-digested pTZ18R (TOYOBO, Japan). Then, into the SacI site of the resultant plasmid, a SacI fragment containing a tetracycline-resistance gene derived from pBEST-307 (Itaya, 1992) was inserted in both orientations. The plasmids were transformed into *B. subtilis* 168 and integrated by a double crossover with selection for tetracycline resistance (10 μg tetracycline ml⁻¹). Proper replacement of the internal region of the *ydbE* gene by the tetracycline-resistance gene was confirmed by PCR.

**Construction of an in-frame deletion mutant of *ydbF*.** An in-frame deletion mutant of *ydbF* was created on the basis of the two-step allele-replacement method of Stahl & Ferrari (1984). Briefly, the genomic regions upstream and downstream of *ydbF* were amplified by PCR using the primers bFUF (5′-CCGATGCTTCCGTT CAGCCC-3′) and bFUR (5′-GCCA-TAGCCTGTGCCGCTTCCAACGGATTGAGAGGC-3′), and bFDF (5′-GCTCTCAATCCGTTGGAAAGGCGGGCAC-AGGCTATGGC-3′) and bFDR (5′-TCCTGGGACAGCGT-ATCATTC-3′), respectively. These two fragments were mixed and further amplified using the primers bFUF and bFDR, yielding a fragment containing a deletion in the *ydbF* structural gene which joins codon 11 to codon 488. Two copies of this PCR-generated fragment were tandemly cloned into pCP112 (Price *et al.*, 1983). The resultant plasmid was used for creating an in-frame deletion mutant of *ydbF*. Proper deletion of the internal region of the *ydbF* gene was confirmed by PCR.

**Construction of PydbH-bgaB fusions.** A 217 bp fragment (PDH94) covering the promoter region of *ydbH* (PydbH) was amplified by PCR with the primers dbHPF1 (5′-GAAGAA-TTCGTGTTAAAAAGGATAAAC-3′) and dbHPR (5′-GGA-GGATCCGGCCAGACCAGCCCCG-3′), and cloned between the EcoRI and BamHI sites of a plasmid pDLd (Nanamiya *et al.*, 1998), harbouring *amyE*-up and *amyE*-down sequences. The resulting plasmid was used for integration of the PDH94-*bgaB* fusion into the *amyE* locus of the *B. subtilis* genome. Fragments of various length covering PydbH were generated by PCR with the primers dbHPF1.1 (5′-GAAGAA-TTCGATAAACCTGAGACCAAA-3′) for PDH83, dbHPF-1.2 (5′-GAAGAATTCAGACCAAAAAAGACCAAAA-3′) for PDH73, dbHPF1.3 (5′-GAAGAATTCAGACCAAAAATGTC-CGTTA-3′) for PDH64, or dbHPF1.4 (5′-GAAGAATTC-CCGTTATGATCATAAAC-3′) for PDH53, in combination with dbHPR. These products were fused to *bgaB* and integrated into the *amyE* locus as described above.

**β-Galactosidase assay.** An aliquot (1 ml) of cells growing in NYE medium with or without the addition of carbon source was harvested by centrifugation and the activity of β-galactosidase was assayed according to Youngman *et al.* (1985). Incubation for the assay was performed at 28 °C for LacZ (*E. coli* β-galactosidase) and at 62 °C for BgaB (*Bacillus stearothermophilus* β-galactosidase). Units are expressed as nanomoles of 4-methylumbelliferyl β-D-galactoside hydrolysed min⁻¹ (mg protein)⁻¹. Protein concentration was determined using a Bio-Rad Protein Assay Kit.

**Northern and primer-extension analysis.** Total RNA was extracted from wild-type cells growing in DS medium at exponential phase (OD~600~ 0·1, 0·3 and 0·6) by the method described by Igo & Losick (1986). In the Northern analysis, aliquots containing 5 μg of total RNA were electrophoresed and blotted onto positively charged nylon membrane (Hybond-N⁺; Amersham). Hybridization and detection were performed using digoxigenin-labelled RNA probes (10 ng), according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Boehringer Mannheim). RNA probes were synthesized *in vitro* with T7 RNA polymerase using PCR products as templates. Templates were prepared using primers in which the T7 promoter sequence was added to the specific sequences for amplification. In the primer-extension analysis, 20 μg of the RNA sample was incubated with the digoxigenin-end-labelled primers (1 pM) specific for the *ydbH* gene (dbHDig; 5′-GACAATG-ACCCCGATGATGAC-3′) for 60 min at 60 °C, and gradually

cooled down for 90 min to the ambient temperature. After the addition of dNTPs (2·5 mM each) and reverse transcriptase (Gibco-BRL), the reaction mixture was incubated for 60 min at 37°C. The cDNA products were then electrophoresed through an 8% polyacrylamide/urea gel, blotted onto the positively charged nylon membrane and detected according to the manufacturer's instructions (Boehringer Mannheim). DNA ladders for use as size markers were created with the same digoxigenin-end-labelled primers and a DIG Taq DNA sequencing kit (Boehringer Mannheim).

**RESULTS**

**Operonic structure of the ydbEFGH region**

Arrangement of the ydbEFGH genes on the B. subtilis genome is schematically shown in Fig. 1a. The nucleotide sequence of the region suggested that the ydbFGH genes constitute an operon and are transcribed divergently to ydbE, which is co-transcribed with the downstream ydbD encoding a 30 kDa general stress protein (Antelmann et al., 1997). Indeed, Northern blot analysis of total RNA from B. subtilis cells growing in a sporulation medium using RNA probes encompassing each gene detected 2·0 kb (T1) and 3·8 kb (T2) transcripts covering ydbDE and ydbFGH, respectively (Fig. 1b). Additionally, a 4·6 kb (T2*) transcript was detected by the ydbF, G and H probes, but not by the ydbI probe (data not shown), suggesting the existence of an additional promoter overlapping the ydbE gene. In addition to the T1 transcript, the ydbE probe detected a transcript of approximately 0·3 kb (T1*), which might be prematurely terminated or degraded product. These transcripts were detected at constant levels in the early, middle and late stages of the vegetative-growth phase, although the intensities of the T2 and T2* transcript are much weaker than those of T1 and T1*. Furthermore, a transcript of 1·3 kb (T3), which was complementary to the size of the ydbH gene, was strongly induced at mid-exponential phase and, soon after, reduced. Several other bands detected were suspected to be observed due to non-specific hybridization with 16S (1·5 kb) and 23S (2·9 kb) rRNAs. In conclusion, the ydbFG genes were found to be co-transcribed weakly throughout the vegetative-growth phase. The ydbE gene was also expressed throughout the vegetative-growth phase, but more actively than ydbFG. In contrast, the ydbH gene has its own promoter whose activity seems to be regulated in response to a subtle change in the environmental conditions.

**Growth of wild-type and ydbEFGH mutants in minimal medium containing yeast extract and C₄-dicarboxylate**

To examine the function of ydbE, ydbF, ydbG and ydbH in the uptake of C₄-dicarboxylates, we constructed knockout mutants of each gene and then tested their ability to utilize C₄-dicarboxylates as the sole carbon source for growth. Disruption of the genes was accomplished by integrating a pMUTINT3 plasmid harbouring an internal fragment of each gene into the genome by a Campbell-type recombination (Vagner et al., 1998). The ability of the mutants to utilize C₄-dicarboxylates was monitored according to Willecke & Lange (1974). The growth of the wild-type strain in a minimal salts medium containing 0·05% (w/v) yeast extract as the sole carbon source (NYE medium) ceased when the OD₆₀₀ of the culture reached around 0·2. Growth was stimulated by the addition of a carbon source, such as C₄-dicarboxylates (Fig. 2a). The wild-type B. subtilis cells can readily grow utilizing malate, succinate or fumarate as an additional carbon source after exhaustion of the nutrients in yeast extract. If the mutants could not utilize the additional carbon sources, their growth would remain arrested regardless of the supplement. Results shown in Fig. 2 (b–e) clearly show that all the knockout mutants could utilize malate but not succinate or fumarate, indicating that the ydbEFGH genes are essential for the uptake of succinate and fumarate in B. subtilis.

The defect in the ydbF::pMUTINT3 mutant could be due to a polar effect of the plasmid insertion on the downstream ydbG expression, although it seemed un-

BgaB activity was measured in wild-type strain 168 (a) and $ydbE$ (b), $ydbF$ (c), $ydbG$ (d) and $ydbH$ (e) mutants. Time 0 indicates the time when the appropriate carbon source was added. Symbols: no addition (○), with the addition of succinate (■), fumarate (▲) or malate (●).

likely as discussed below. We constructed a large, in-frame deletion within $ydbF$, on the basis of the methods described previously by Stahl & Ferrari (1984). Such a $ydbF$ mutant, where $ydbG$ expression might not be affected, also showed deficiencies in utilization of succinate and fumarate (Fig. 2f).

The presence of at least two transport systems for malate has been suggested in *B. subtilis*. Therefore, the apparent absence of a defect in the utilization of malate in the mutants might be due to the presence of additional transport system(s). The inactivation of the $ydbD$ gene, which encodes a general stress protein and was co-transcribed with $ydbE$ in the normal growth phase, showed no effect on C₄-dicarboxylate utilization (data not shown).

Expression of $ydbH$ is regulated by $ydbE$, $ydbF$ and $ydbG$

We next addressed the question of whether the defect of C₄-dicarboxylate uptake in the $ydbF$ and $ydbG$ mutants, probably encoding a two-component sensor and regulator pair, was due to a defect in the activation of expression of the $ydbH$ gene which appeared to encode a C₄-dicarboxylate transporter. We constructed a transcriptional fusion between the $ydbH$ promoter region and a promoterless *B. stearothermophilus* $bgaB$ gene, which encodes a thermostable β-galactosidase, and integrated it into the $amyE$ locus of the *B. subtilis* genome. In a strain carrying the PydBH::bgaB fusion in an otherwise wild-type genetic background, β-galactosidase was induced in NYE medium and also to a similar extent in the medium supplemented with succinate. The activity was slightly elevated by the addition of fumarate, but markedly decreased by the addition of malate (Fig. 3a). As expected, when we introduced the PydBH::bgaB fusion into the pMUTINT3-inserted $ydbF$ and $ydbG$ mutants, the β-galactosidase activity was decreased to background levels in all tested conditions and was not stimulated by succinate or fumarate (Fig. 3c, d). In contrast, inactivation of the $ydbH$ gene did not abolish PydBH expression, but rather stimulated it (Fig. 3e). Unexpectedly, we found that PydBH expression completely disappeared also in the knockout mutant of the $ydbE$ gene (Fig. 3b), whose product has a strong similarity to the *Rho. capsulatus* C₄-dicarboxylate periplasmic binding protein, DctP.

YdbE is not directly required for uptake of C₄-dicarboxylates in *B. subtilis*

In *Rho. capsulatus*, DctP is thought to be one of the subunits of the C₄-dicarboxylate-transport machinery (Forward et al., 1997). However, the results described above suggest that the *B. subtilis* homologue, YdbE, functioned in the induction of the YdbH transporter. To elucidate this difference, we tested whether fumarate uptake could occur without the YdbE function in *B. subtilis*. To inactivate $ydbE$ and, at the same time, to induce $ydbH$ artificially, we replaced the internal region of the $ydbE$ gene with a tetracycline-resistance gene which has a constitutive strong promoter and is followed by no effective transcription-termination signal. When the tetracycline-resistance gene was inserted in the same direction as that of $ydbE$, the resulting mutant showed defects in the utilization of fumarate as the carbon source and in the induction of the PydBH::bgaB expression, as were observed in the $ydbE::pMUTINT3$ mutant (Fig. 4b). On the contrary, when the tetracycline-resistance gene was inserted in the reverse orientation, the growth of the mutant was prolonged by the addition of fumarate and the expression of $ydbH$ was induced (Fig. 4c). Since the difference between the two $ydbE$ null mutants was only the direction of transcription of the inserted tetracycline-resistance gene, these results indicated that the readthrough transcription from the tetracycline-resistance gene affected the fumarate response in the mutants. A high level of transcription of the $ydbFGH$ genes in the $ydbE::tet$ (reverse) mutant was

The left-hand panels show growth properties measured by optical density at 600 nm. The centre panels show the expression profile of *ydbH* as measured by BgaB activity. Cells were cultured in NYE medium without (○) and with (●) the addition of fumarate. Time 0 indicates the time when fumarate was added. In the right-hand panel, the organization of the *ydbEFGH* genes and the tetracycline-resistance gene are indicated by black and white arrows, respectively. Shaded arrows indicate the *lacZ* gene introduced by integration of pMUTINT3, with its activity measured in NYE medium with fumarate in four experiments and shown with standard deviation.

confirmed by inserting pMUTINT3 into the *ydbF* locus and monitoring the activity of the promoterless *lacZ* gene in the plasmid (Fig. 4, right panel). Thus, when *ydbFG* (and *ydbH*) were artificially overexpressed, *ydbH* expression and fumarate uptake could resume without *YdbE* function, suggesting that *ydbE* was required, if at all, for the efficient induction of *ydbH* but not for the uptake of C₄-dicarboxylates in *B.* subtilis. It should be noted that two factors would contribute to *ydbH* expression in the *ydbE::tet* (reverse) mutant. One is transcription from the promoter for the *ydbH* gene induced by the overexpression of the YdbFG two-component system, because the induction of the PydbH activity in the *ydbE::tet* (reverse) mutant was observed

at the *amyE* locus. The other would be the readthrough transcription from the *tet* gene in the mutant.

The *cis*-acting sequence required for the induction of *ydbH* expression

To further analyse the regulation of expression of *ydbH*, first we determined the position of the 5′ end of the *ydbH* transcript by primer-extension analysis using total RNA of *B.* subtilis 168 cells growing in DS medium, in which *ydbH* expression was strongly induced at mid-exponential phase (Fig. 1b). As shown in Fig. 5a, initiation sites of transcription were detected at 41 and 42 bp upstream of the translation start site, accompanied

DISCUSSION

The transport system for C₄-dicarboxylates, such as malate, fumarate and succinate, was poorly understood in Gram-positive bacteria. The whole genome sequence of *B. subtilis* revealed two genes, *ydbE* and *ydbH*, whose deduced products are highly homologous to the C₄-dicarboxylate periplasmic binding proteins and transport proteins in Gram-negative bacteria, respectively. Between *ydbE* and *ydbH*, two other genes, *ydbF* and *ydbG* that were predicted to encode a two-component sensor-regulator pair, were located. Furthermore, the deduced products, YdbF and YdbG proteins, had significant similarities to the *E. coli* C₄-dicarboxylate sensor and regulator pair, DcuS and DcuR, respectively. Indeed, inactivation of each one of the *ydbEFGH* genes caused deficiency of utilization of fumarate and succinate but not of malate. The expression of *ydbH* was stimulated in minimal salts medium containing 0·05% yeast extract, but repressed by the addition of malate to the medium. The inactivation of the putative sensor-regulator pair or solute-binding protein, *ydbFG* or *ydbE*, caused complete loss of *ydbH* expression. However, the utilization of fumarate and the stimulation of *ydbH* expression occurred without the *ydbE* function under conditions where *ydbFG* and/or *ydbH* were artificially overexpressed. These results, together with the sequence similarities, implied that 1) YdbH is a C₄-dicarboxylate transport protein and 2) YdbF and YdbG constitute a C₄-dicarboxylate sensor kinase and regulator pair, which activates *ydbH* expression. Furthermore, *ydbFG* seems to regulate the expression of *ydbH* in response to external signal(s) as is the case in the Gram-negative bacteria, because the inactivation of *ydbH* did not affect its own regulation, indicating that the regulation may not depend on cellular metabolism of incorporated C₄-dicarboxylates.

Elucidation of the exact role of YdbE, similar to *Rho. capsulatus* C₄-dicarboxylate binding periplasmic protein DctP, awaits further characterization. *Rho. capsulatus* DctP was shown to be able to bind C₄-dicarboxylate in vitro (Walmsley et al., 1992a, b) and thought to constitute a transporter complex together with a membrane translocator, DctQM (Forward et al., 1997). In our study, fumarate could be utilized without the *ydbE* function when *ydbH* was artificially induced by overexpressing *ydbFG* and/or *ydbH*. This suggested that transport of fumarate could be achieved by the YdbH transporter alone, and *ydbE* would play a role mainly in the regulation of *ydbH* expression together with *ydbFG*. An external periplasmic solute-binding protein necessary for sensory transduction in two-component systems has been reported for *Agrobacterium tumefaciens*. *A. tumefaciens* initiates infection of a wide range of plants with signals at the wound site. In this process, the ChvE protein, which is a periplasmic monosaccharide-binding protein, was found to interact directly with the periplasmic domain of the VirA sensor protein to activate the VirG regulator (Ankenbauer & Nester, 1990; Cangelosi et al., 1990; Shimoda et al., 1993). In Gram-positive bacteria without

a defined periplasmic space, external solute-binding proteins are suggested to be expressed at the cell surface as lipoproteins (Gilson *et al.*, 1988). The amino-terminal part of YdbE has hydrophobic amino acid residues which possess characteristic features of a signal peptide and a weak but significant consensus sequence for the precursors of lipoproteins could be recognized (L-L-A-C-L-A; the consensus sequence is L-Y-Z-cleavage site-C-y-z; where Y is A, S, V, Q or T, Z is G or A, y is S, G, A, N, Q or D and z is S, A, N or Q; Heijne, 1989). Therefore, it may be assumed that in *B. subtilis*, *ydbE* exists at the cell surface and plays a sensory role in the *ydbFG* two-component system, giving rise to specificity or increased efficiency, although overproduction of YdbFG proteins led to the expression of *ydbH* in the absence of YdbE.

It is interesting to note that inactivation of the *ydbEFGH* system in *B. subtilis* does not cause a defect in malate utilization, in contrast to other known Dct systems essential for transporting all C₄-dicarboxylates. Moreover, expression of the transporter protein, YdbH, was repressed by the addition of malate. It was reported that malate was the best inducer for the C₄-dicarboxylic acid transport system in *B. subtilis*. It was also suggested that at least two transport systems for malate were induced in *B. subtilis* (Willecke & Lange, 1974). The first system, which was required for the uptake of malate, fumarate and succinate, was induced in NYE medium. The second system was then induced by the addition of a large amount of malate. In a search of the *B. subtilis* genome database, we noticed a newly discovered ORF, *yufR*, whose deduced product was highly homologous (55·0%) to the malate-specific permease in *Streptococcus bovis* (Kawai *et al.*, 1997). In our preliminary experiments, the expression of *yufR* was activated by malate. Therefore, the Dct system in this study would correspond to the first C₄-dicarboxylate-transport system reported by Willecke & Lange (1974), though the exact chemical nature of the inducer in yeast extract is obscure, and another highly active transporter for malate, such as the YufR protein, could be induced by the addition of malate.

The deletion analysis of the promoter region of *ydbH* revealed that a direct repeat sequence was required for the activation of *ydbH* expression. Furthermore, a catabolite-responsive element (CRE) was found in the –10 region of the promoter (Fig. 5b), suggesting the negative regulation of *ydbH* expression by a CRE-binding protein, such as CcpA (Catabolite Control Protein) (Hueck *et al.*, 1994; Fujita *et al.*, 1995; Hueck & Hillen, 1995; Henkin, 1996). In our preliminary experiments, the expression of *ydbH* was repressed in the presence of glucose, and the induction of *ydbH* was restored even in the presence of glucose when a *ccpA* (encoding CcpA) mutation was introduced into the cells. Interestingly, the repression by the addition of malate was also suppressed in the *ccpA* mutant, although the mechanism of the involvement of CcpA in the repression by malate needs further examination.

Finally, based on the results discussed in this report, we propose to rename the *ydbE, F, G* and *H* genes *dctB* (solute Binding), *dctS* (Sensor kinase), *dctR* (response Regulator) and *dctP* (Permease), respectively.
