■ Abstract Acid secretion by the gastric parietal cell is regulated by paracrine, endocrine, and neural pathways. The physiological stimuli include histamine, acetylcholine, and gastrin via their receptors located on the basolateral plasma membranes. Stimulation of acid secretion typically involves an initial elevation of intracellular calcium and/or cAMP followed by activation of a cAMP-dependent protein kinase cascade that triggers the translocation and insertion of the proton pump enzyme, H,K-ATPase, into the apical plasma membrane of parietal cells. Whereas the H,K-ATPase contains a plasma membrane targeting motif, the stimulation-mediated relocation of the H,K-ATPase from the cytoplasmic membrane compartment to the apical plasma membrane is mediated by a SNARE protein complex and its regulatory proteins. This review summarizes the progress made toward an understanding of the cell biology of gastric acid secretion. In particular we have reviewed the early signaling events following histaminergic and cholinergic activation, the identification of multiple factors participating in the trafficking and recycling of the proton pump, and the role of the cytoskeleton in supporting the apical pole remodeling, which appears to be necessary for active acid secretion by the parietal cell. Emphasis is placed on identifying protein factors that serve as effectors for the mechanistic changes associated with cellular activation and the secretory response.  

INTRODUCTION  

Secretion of HCl into the stomach is mediated by the oxyntic (acid-secreting) cell, one of several epithelial cell types within gastric glands. In mammalian gastric mucosa, oxyntic cells project peripherally, onto the walls of the gland and thus are commonly called parietal cells, which is the designation we use in this review. Gastric acid secretion is a tightly regulated process triggered by ligand-receptor binding at the basolateral plasma membrane with ultimate output of H⁺, Cl⁻ and H₂O across the apical plasma membrane of the parietal cell. The physiological stimuli include acetylcholine, gastrin, and especially, histamine, which

operate via basolateral membrane receptors. Stimulation of acid secretion typically involves an initial elevation of intracellular calcium and cAMP, followed by activation of protein kinase cascades, which trigger the translocation and insertion of H,K-ATPase—the proton pump enzyme—into the apical plasma membrane of the parietal cell. This review primarily focuses on research over the past 10 years that has sought to identify and describe specific roles for proteins involved in the activation, membrane translocation, and recycling processes that underlie acid secretion. Table 1 provides a summary of the various proteins that have been implicated in the functional activity of parietal cell secretion. In the course of this review, relevant earlier studies are briefly discussed and references given to related review articles.

# AN ELABORATE STRUCTURAL BASIS FOR ACID SECRETION

The parietal cell is a highly specialized epithelial cell with several distinctive morphological characteristics that directly bear on its functional activities (1). The apical plasma membrane has the unusual structural form of a series of small canals (canaliculi) that invaginate from the surface and project throughout the entire cell interior, with frequent interconnections among canaliculi. In the non-secreting or resting parietal cell, these apical canalicular surfaces are lined with short, stubby microvilli that are supported by prominent actin microfilaments including accessory actin-binding proteins. Throughout the cytoplasmic space there is an abundance of membranous structures, rich in H,K-ATPase, that take the morphological form of vesicles, tubules, and cisternal sacs; these are commonly called H,K-ATPase-rich tubulovesicles.

Parietal cells undergo a profound morphological transition upon activation of acid secretion. Although limited by the optics of light microscopy, careful histological examination by Golgi in the late 19th century noted the enlargement of canaliculi that occurred in secreting parietal cells. Electron micrographs of maximally stimulated cells have since revealed dilated canalicular spaces, a dramatically expanded apical membrane surface with elongated microvilli, and diminution of cytoplasmic tubulovesicles (2–4). Mounting evidence has contributed to a general consensus for the membrane recycling hypothesis which holds that activation of acid secretion results in a fusion-based recruitment of H,K-ATPase-rich cytoplasmic membranes into the apical plasma membrane (5). However, an alternate view has argued that the H,K-ATPase-rich membranes are contiguous with the apical plasma membrane in both resting and stimulated states, thus negating the need for a fusion-based recruitment process (6–8). Recent evidence has clarified the morphological argument through the use of high-pressure, rapid-freeze fixation to prepare gastric parietal cells for electron microscopy (EM) and analysis of three-dimensional structure (9). Models constructed from ultra-thin serial sections, as well as tomographic reconstruction of thick tissue sections using high voltage EM, clearly demonstrate the separation of tubulovesicular membranes from the plasma

membrane and generally confirm early studies using chemical fixation techniques. This revisiting of parietal cell ultrastructure, together with the requirement for recruitment/fusion-based proteins in parietal cell activation (see below) reinforces the recruitment-recycling model of parietal cell activation. In addition, this new fixation method has revealed that the abundant parietal cell mitochondria form an extensive reticular network throughout the cytoplasm, as has been reported for several other cell types. Because of the close coupling between acid secretion and oxidative metabolism, it will be of interest to evaluate whether, and to what extent, dynamics of mitochondria are related to the cell activation.

# SIGNAL TRANSDUCTION UNDERLYING GASTRIC ACID SECRETION

Activation of acid secretion by parietal cells is triggered by paracrine, endocrine, and neural stimuli in vivo. Study of the cell biology of acid secretion has been greatly facilitated by the technique of gastric gland isolation, developed by Berglindh & Öbrink, along with the method to monitor acid secretion in vitro by accumulation of the weak base, aminopyrine (10).

From the pioneering work of Chew and her colleagues (11, 12), primary cultures of parietal cells have also been of special value in localizing functionally relevant proteins and defining events in the secretory cascade. Many intracellular signaling pathways have now been identified with their contributing roles in parietal cell activation, including protein kinase A (PKA), protein kinase C (PKC), Ca²⁺-calmodulin (CaM) kinase II, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3 kinase), and several other downstream kinases. Histaminergic stimulation is by far the most potent activation pathway observed for the stimulation of gastric acid secretion in vitro. Although cholinergic and gastrinergic stimulation can be seen in vitro, the magnitude of stimulation for many species is much reduced compared with stimulation in vivo, most likely because parietal cells are in close contact with histamine-releasing enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cells in vivo (13). Isolated canine parietal cells appear to be an exception, tending to be more responsive to cholinergic stimuli than to histamine (1). In this review we first focus on signaling events underlying cAMP-mediated stimulation and the PKA stimulation pathway, and then move to a discussion of cholinergic pathways and an overview of other kinase pathways.

## cAMP-Mediated PKA Activation and Protein Phosphorylation

Evidence implicating cAMP as an intracellular messenger mediating HCl secretion was presented by Roth & Ivy more than 50 years ago (14). Using isolated gastric glands, Chew et al. (15) directly showed that histamine elevates intracellular levels of cAMP leading to activation of PKA (16), and specifically type I cAMP-dependent protein kinase (17). Activation of PKA initiates a cascade of

phosphorylation events through the activation of other downstream effectors. Collectively, these events trigger membrane and cytoskeletal rearrangements within the parietal cell, as well as increase electrical conductance across the gastric epithelium (1). In the 1980s, several groups reported on stimulus-associated phosphorylation of parietal cell proteins, most of which were simply identified by molecular size (18–21). By tracing the phosphorylation of proteins that occurred concomitant with stimulation of gastric glands by histamine, Urushidani and his colleagues (19, 22) identified an 80-kDa peripheral membrane protein, later characterized as the cytoskeletal-associated protein ezrin (23, 24), and a 120-kDa protein, now called pachyin and recently implicated in Cl⁻ and water transport (25, 26). In addition, several stimulation-related phosphoproteins earlier identified by Chew and her colleagues on the basis of molecular size (18, 27) are now recognized as 40-kDa lasp-1, 66-kDa coroninse (28), and CSPP-28, the latter being a calcium-sensitive phosphoprotein of 28-kDa (29). Possible functional roles for each of these phosphoproteins are discussed below.

The early studies of signaling processes related to acid secretion were carried out on intact gastric glands. Because the plasma membrane provides a barrier to separate intracellular environment from extracellular bath, the development of permeable parietal cell models was important for a more direct manipulation of cytosol. Several permeabilized models, in which electroporation (30) and digitonin (30–33) were used to render gastric glandular cells permeable, have provided useful information. However, none of these earlier permeabilized preparations could be transformed from the resting to secreting state by the addition of secretagogues or cAMP. This problem was eliminated by the use of α-toxin, isolated from *Staphylococcus aureus*, as a permeabilizing agent. The α-toxin permeabilized gastric gland model can be triggered by cAMP to effect the resting-to-secreting transition that is correlated with the phosphorylation, from ³²P-ATP, of a dozen phosphoproteins (34), several of which are similar to those mentioned above from the intact gland studies.

The narrow pore size generated by α-toxin (~3 nm in diameter) allows passage of only small molecules such as nucleotides. Thus the α-toxin model has been useful in studies of metabolism and protein phosphorylation associated with stimulation (34, 35), but access to large macromolecules is required for biochemical reconstitution of parietal cell activation. To this end, several permeabilized systems have been developed to allow the introduction of large peptides and proteins while retaining the resting-to-secreting transition in response to the addition of cAMP. One system employing the detergent β-escin tested a variety of inhibitory peptides that block the activities of several protein kinases, including PKA, PKC, myosin light chain kinase (MLCK), and CaM kinase (36). These peptide inhibition experiments confirmed the roles of PKA and MLCK, but not CaM kinase and PKC, in parietal cell secretion. In addition, the inclusion of peptides that inhibit Arf (adenosine ribosylation factor) into β-escin-permeabilized glands was shown to attenuate the cAMP-stimulated parietal cell activation, suggesting a functional role for Arf protein in parietal cell secretion.

An alternative model system has used the Streptococcal toxin streptolysin $O$ (SLO) to permeabilize gastric glands. With this model, Ammar et al. (37) were able to show the incorporation of fluorescent-labeled actin into the pool of endogenous F-actin in SLO-permeabilized glands. They also tested the action of several syntaxin isoforms on the cAMP-activated secretory response (as discussed below in the section on SNARE proteins).

Yet another approach for permeabilized models is to use a depleted system, such as the digitonin model, and probe for cytoplasmic constituents that restore functional activity. Searching for players underlying the cAMP-mediated parietal cell activation, Akagi et al. (38) carried out a reconstitution experiment in which they added brain cytosol and purified fractions into digitonin-permeabilized gastric glands. They demonstrated a stimulatory activity by brain cytosol as judged by aminopyrine uptake. The stimulatory activity was further characterized as phosphatidylinositol transfer protein (PITP). Although PITP is a stimulatory factor for acid secretion, it is not associated with the cAMP-dependent pathway. This reconstitution model promises to be of importance for the further identification and function of critical components necessary for parietal cell activation, including other PKA effectors; it will also address questions of how known proteins such as ezrin and lasp integrate the cAMP signal to membrane cytoskeleton remodeling.

Lasp-1 was initially identified in the parietal cell as a 40-kDa phosphoprotein related to cAMP-mediated activation of acid secretion (18). Lasp-1 has been identified as a signaling molecule that is phosphorylated upon elevation of [cAMP]$_i$ in pancreas and intestine, as well as gastric mucosa, and is selectively expressed in ion-transporting cells within epithelial tissues, such as cortical regions of pancreatic and salivary duct cells and in certain F-actin-rich cells in the distal tubule/collecting duct (34, 35). Lasp-1 has been characterized as a new LIM protein subfamily member containing an N-terminal LIM domain, a C-terminal SH3 domain, and two internal nebulin repeats, with speculation that lasp-1 may function as an adaptor molecule to relay the upstream signaling to downstream effectors (39). Recent biochemical evidence revealed that lasp-1 binds to nonmuscle filamentous (F) actin, but not monomeric (G) actin, in a phosphorylation-dependent manner (40). The apparent $K_d$ of bacterially expressed his-tagged lasp-1 binding to F-actin was 2 $\mu$M, with a saturation stoichiometry of $\sim$1:7. Phosphorylation of recombinant lasp-1 with PKA increased the $K_d$ for lasp-1 binding to F-actin and decreased the $B_{\text{max}}$. The major PKA-dependent phosphorylation sites were localized in rabbit lasp-1 to S99 and S146 (40).

Immunostaining of gastric glands stimulated by the cAMP-dependent pathway showed that lasp-1 was redistributed from the basolateral membrane to the apical canalicular membrane of parietal cells upon stimulation (41). Alternatively, exposure of gastric mucosal fibroblasts to the protein kinase C activator, PMA, induced the formation of lamellipodial extensions and nascent focal complexes that contained both lasp-1 and F-actin (40). The selective phosphorylation-dependent regulation of lasp-1 in F-actin-rich epithelial cells and the recruitment of lasp-1 to cellular regions associated with dynamic actin turnover suggest that this protein

may play an integral and specific role in the regulation of cytoskeletal/membrane-based cellular activities.

Parchorin was first identified by SDS-PAGE as a 120-kDa phosphoprotein associated with histamine/cAMP stimulation of acid secretion (19); the cDNA sequence of parchorin has recently been cloned, having an actual molecular mass of 65 kDa (26). Its anomalous migration on gels is due to an unusually high content of acidic amino acids. Parchorin is a novel protein that has significant homology to the family of chloride intracellular channels (CLIC) and has been localized to a variety of epithelial tissues that are active in the transport of salt and water, especially choroid plexus, salivary glands, and lacrimal glands, in addition to the parietal cell (25, 26). Endogenous parietal cell parchorin is present in the cytosol and relocated to the apical plasma membrane upon histamine stimulation, very reminiscent of the translocation of H,K-ATPase in response to stimulation. When parchorin, linked to green fluorescent protein (GFP), was exogenously expressed in kidney cells, GFP-parchorin also appeared in the cytosol and was relocated to the plasma membrane when Cl⁻ efflux from the cells was triggered. Interestingly, parchorin was co-purified with a new type of kinase activity (42), suggesting that there may be some functional link between that kinase and the phosphorylated form of parchorin.

## Cholinergic Pathways of Activation

Activation of parietal cells by cholinergic agents acting on muscarinic M₃ receptors clearly involves an elevation of intracellular Ca²⁺ ([Ca²⁺]ᵢ). Studies on isolated gastric glands with Ca²⁺-sensitive fluorescent probes revealed a rapid spike in parietal cell [Ca²⁺]ᵢ, up to 0.15–0.5 μM within 4–6 s after addition of the M₃ agonist carbachol, followed by a sustained lower-level elevation of [Ca²⁺]ᵢ, that persisted during the resulting stimulation of acid secretion by the glands (43, 44). The secretagogue-dependent changes in [Ca²⁺]ᵢ occur from an intracellular store of bound Ca²⁺ and are independent of extracellular Ca²⁺, unless the stores are first depleted (45, 46). Buffering of the rise in [Ca²⁺]ᵢ by the chelating agent BAPTA prevents the acid secretory response to carbachol but permits subsequent stimulation by histamine or forskolin (47). Intracellular Ca²⁺ stores are relatively easily depleted by cholinergic stimulation in a Ca²⁺-free medium, although the stores can be replenished from extracellular sources through a La³⁺-sensitive pathway (45).

The carbachol-induced rise in [Ca²⁺]ᵢ has been correlated with a rise in parietal cell inositol trisphosphate (IP₃) levels, thus implicating IP₃ as the messenger from the M₃ receptor to the internal Ca²⁺ stores (43). The role of PKC in cholinergic activation has been more controversial, particularly through the use of PKC activators such as phorbol esters (e.g., TPA), which have been shown to inhibit or activate both carbachol- and histamine-stimulated acid secretion (48–51). Chew et al. (52) measured the PKC expression in parietal cells, as well as the response of gastric glands to a variety of PKC inhibitors. Their data showed several isoforms of PKC present with some, particularly PKC-ε, being localized by immunocytochemistry

to a parietal cell compartment similar to filamentous actin (52). Inhibitors of PKC activity, such as Ro 31-8220, were found to potentiate both carbachol- and histamine-mediated acid secretion, also causing a dose-dependent decrease in the phosphorylation of the cytoskeletal-related proteins ezrin and pp66, later characterized as coroninse (28, 52). These data suggest a negative modulatory role for PKC in acid secretion and were confirmed in principle by an independent study (53), although there was some disagreement regarding responsiveness of specific PKC isozyms.

A role for CaM kinase in parietal cell activation stimulated by the cholinergic pathway was suggested by Tsunoda et al. (54) who found that KN-62, a pharmacological inhibitor of CaM kinase II, inhibited carbachol-mediated acid secretion, but did not alter the rise in cytosolic Ca²⁺ caused by carbachol. KN-62 was without effect on histamine- or forskolin-mediated responses (55). The presence of CaM kinase II in gastric cells was verified by enzymatic assay (54).

The calcium-sensitive phosphoprotein of 28 kDa known as CSPP28 was originally discovered based on its phosphorylation associated with cholinergic stimulation (27). CSPP28 is rapidly phosphorylated in intact parietal cells in response to both the cholinergic agonist, carbachol, and the calcium ionophore, ionomycin (29). Subsequent studies showed that recombinant CSPP28 was phosphorylated by both crude parietal cell homogenate and purified CaM kinase II in a calcium/calmodulin-dependent manner (29). Whereas CSPP28 is closely tied to a calcium-mediated phosphorylation, it would be of great interest to ascertain the nature of CaM kinase-mediated phosphorylation on CSPP28 and whether such modification regulates the function of CSPP28 in the activation process.

Carbachol has been shown to induce IkB kinase activity in canine parietal cells via Ca²⁺- and PKC-dependent pathways (56). IkB kinase appears to be a key element in the signaling cascade that activates NF-kB (57, 58), which is an important transcription factor and regulator of numerous genes modulating the inflammatory response. Carbachol is also a potent inducer of several families of protein kinases known as mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) or extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases (ERKs) and the c-Jun N-terminal protein kinases (JNKs) in the canine parietal cell system (59–61). Generally, these kinases are known to be fundamental signaling elements in cellular functions of growth, differentiation, and secretion (62–65). However, it is uncertain as to what specific role these kinases play in the acid secretory activation pathway because presumed specific inhibitors of the various kinases reportedly produce both inhibitory and enhancing effects. For example, a pronounced up-regulation of p38 kinase, another member of the MAPK family of protein kinases, occurred in response to carbachol and could be blocked by the p38 kinase-specific inhibitor SB-203580 (66). Interestingly, carbachol-induced aminopyrine uptake by intact canine parietal cells was potentiated several-fold by SB-203580, suggesting that active p38 kinase was inhibitory to acid secretion (66). Collectively these data demonstrate the extensive interrelationship of signaling elements that are activated via M₃-muscarinic stimulation of gastric parietal cells. It remains to be established which elements are

directly involved in the activation of parietal cell secretion, which are modulatory or inhibitory to the activation, and which are true downstream effector proteins rather than secondary and tertiary reporters of changes in metabolic load.

# Modulation by EGF and TGF-$\alpha$

To reveal the mechanisms underlying the actions of EGF and TGF-$\alpha$ on acid secretion, Chew et al. (67) studied the effects of these agents on isolated parietal cells and primary cultures. They categorized two apparently opposed responses: $(a)$ an acute inhibition of histamine- and carbachol-mediated acid secretion and $(b)$ an enhancement of acid secretory function with chronic exposure to the growth factors. Because of the observed differential effects of the acute and chronic responses to tyrosine kinase inhibitors, they proposed that EGF and TGF-$\alpha$ modulate parietal cell function by multiple signaling pathways. They reasoned that a soluble tyrosine kinase was involved in mediating the chronic effects of EGF, whereas the acute potentiation of histamine-stimulated secretion by certain tyrosine kinase inhibitors was probably not mediated by receptor-associated tyrosine kinases. In a further study of these growth factors on parietal cell activation, these authors showed that EGF biphasically activated extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases, known as ERK-1 and ERK-2, with a peak response occurring at approximately 5 min, followed by a sustained activation for at least 2 h (68). In contrast to EGF, the phorbol ester PKC activator TPA induced a sustained activation of ERK-1 and ERK-2 for at least 2 h. Carbachol also activated ERK-1 and ERK-2, but the response was weaker and monophasic. However, the ERK-signaling cascade was not modulated by elevated intracellular free $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ or cAMP.

Takeuchi et al. (59, 60) confirmed the biphasic effects of EGF on isolated canine parietal cells and tested the role of ERKs as possible signal modulators for gastric secretion. In their studies, carbachol caused a pronounced increase in the kinase activity of ERK2 in extracts prepared from canine parietal cells (gastrin and EGF had modest effects, and histamine had no effect), but unlike Chew's group, these authors found that the stimulatory response to carbachol appeared to be dependent on elevated $[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_{i}$ and that a specific inhibitor of ERK, PD-98059, abolished the stimulatory response. Addition of the ERK inhibitor to intact parietal cells led to a modest elevation, at best, of aminopyrine uptakes stimulated by carbachol or other secretagogues, thus the ERK pathway has a minimal role in the direct activation of gastric secretion. This conclusion is supported by later work suggesting that the increased ERK activity stimulated by EGF appears coupled to H,K-ATPase $\alpha$-subunit expression (69) which may be the reason for the slightly enhanced secretory activity associated with ERK activation and may even form the basis for the long-term stimulatory effects of EGF. The serine-threonine protein kinase Akt appears to be another element in the EGF activation cascade leading to increased H,K-ATPase expression in canine parietal cells (70).

Tsunoda et al. (71) employed chemical inhibitors of tyrosine kinases, genistein and erbstatin, to test for their ability to release the parietal cell from the

inhibitory action of EGF/TGF-$\alpha$ on acid secretion. Whereas these two inhibitors totally abolished the TGF-$\alpha$-mediated inhibition, genistein but not erbstatin, also potentiated histamine- and forskolin-triggered acid secretion. Because genistein is a relatively selective inhibitor for cytosolic tyrosine kinases such as c-src, it is likely that some cytosolic tyrosine kinase negatively regulates parietal cell secretion. It has been reported that activation of tyrosine kinase such as c-src stimulates the dynamin-dependent endocytosis of renal outer medullary potassium channels (72). It is possible that EGF/TGF-$\alpha$ exert their inhibition on histamine-stimulated acid secretion by promoting the retrieval of H,K-ATPase from the apical plasma membrane. Although a tyrosine residue in the cytoplasmic tail of the $\beta$-subunit of H,K-ATPase has been implicated in proton pump recycling (73), it would be of great interest to test whether tyrosine kinases such as c-src accelerate the recycling of H,K-ATPase and to ascertain the molecular mechanism underlying the regulation of H,K-ATPase recycling by tyrosine phosphorylation.

## Modulation by Duodenal and Neural Peptides

Physiological modulation of gastric secretion by a variety of peptides, including the duodenal hormone cholecystokinin (CCK) and the neuropeptide vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), has been well established. Of prime importance for the action of CCK and VIP is the paracrine release of somatostatin by D cells in the antrum and fundus (74, 75). Some of the effects of somatostatin are peripheral to parietal cells, e.g., inhibit release of gastrin from antral G cells (75, 76) and inhibit release of histamine from fundic ECL cells (77, 78), but somatostatin also has direct inhibitory effects on parietal cells (79, 80). Somatostatin receptors on the parietal cell have been characterized as sstR2-type receptors (84), which operate via an inhibitory guanine nucleotide-binding protein (Gi) to attenuate the activity of adenylate cyclase. Inhibition of Gi by pertussis toxin reversed the ability of somatostatin to inhibit acid secretion and restored the adenylate cyclase-mediated production of cAMP by isolated canine parietal cells stimulated with histamine and forskolin, but did not alter the stimulatory effects of dbcAMP or Ca${}^{2+}$ pathway (79, 82). In addition somatostatin may have long-term effects on parietal cells because it has been shown to inhibit expression of early response genes, such as c-fos, via a pertussis toxin-sensitive inhibitory pathway in isolated canine parietal cells (83, 84).

## TRAFFICKING OF H,K-ATPASE ASSOCIATED WITH ACID SECRETION

In the resting parietal cell the proton pump resides in cytoplasmic tubulovesicles in an inactive form, presumably because of low permeability of these membranes to K${}^{+}$ (85). Upon stimulation by secretagogues, H,K-ATPase translocates and inserts into the apical plasma membrane which has, or acquires, K${}^{+}$ and Cl${}^{-}$ conductance

pathways that lead to active proton pumping. H,K-ATPase is a P-type ATPase composed of a catalytic subunit ($\alpha$-subunit) and an accessory subunit ($\beta$-subunit). The H,K-ATPase catalyzes the electroneutral exchange of intracellular protons for extracellular potassium ions, thus generating the enormous proton gradients associated with gastric HCl secretion (1, 86). Early EM studies support a model in which H,K-ATPase-containing vesicles fuse with the apical plasma membrane upon stimulation, thus recruiting the pump enzyme into the plasma membrane (87). In the following section we discuss those protein elements that have been identified in parietal cells and have been shown (or implicated) to have a role in directing the trafficking and recycling of H,K-ATPase-rich membranes underlying HCl secretion. Figure 1 provides a cartoon summary of the membrane recycling scheme, indicating the location of putative participating proteins.

## SNARE Proteins

It is widely accepted that the fundamental components of the machinery required for membrane fusion are highly conserved in both constitutive and regulated membrane trafficking pathways (88, 89). These components include $N$-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF), the soluble NSF attachment proteins ($\alpha$-, $\beta$-, and $\gamma$-SNAPs), and SNAP receptors (SNAREs). Membrane-associated SNAREs were first identified in detergent extracts of brain membranes (90). In these extracts, the SNAREs formed a tightly bound complex consisting of SNAP-25, syntaxin, and a protein known as vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP). The specific cleavage of each of these proteins by specific neurotoxins causes a blockade in neurotransmitter release, indicating that SNAP-25, syntaxin, and VAMP are essential for exocytosis in synaptic termini (91). Peng et al. (92) showed that a syntaxin isoform known as syntaxin 3 and the VAMP-2 isoform (also known as synaptobrevin) are specifically associated with H,K-ATPase-containing tubulovesicles in gastric parietal cells, suggesting their possible involvement in secretory activation. Calhoun & Goldenring (93) and Calhoun et al. (94) confirmed the localization of syntaxin 3, VAMP-2, and another secretory carrier membrane protein known as SCAMP to the tubulovesicle fraction, and more importantly demonstrated their relocation to the apical plasma membrane after stimulation. Because these data were consistent with a role for syntaxin 3 in apical trafficking of H,K-ATPase, Ammar et al. (37) carried out experiments in which recombinant syntaxin 3 was added into SLO-permeabilized gastric glands as a potential competitor for endogenous SNARE complex formation. Significantly, exogenous syntaxin 3, but not the syntaxin 5 isoform, blocked cAMP/ATP-mediated HCl secretion in a dose-dependent manner. The authors reasoned that the soluble exogenous syntaxin 3 reacted with endogenous cognate SNAREs to prevent the recruitment of secretory pumps, thus providing direct evidence for the involvement of the syntaxin 3 isoform in parietal cell activation.

Primary cultures of parietal cells have been particularly useful in defining the trafficking and recycling of membrane components associated with stimulation of
acid secretion (95). Karvar et al. (96) used an adenovirus-based GFP reporter to show that GFP-VAMP-2 is co-localized with H,K-ATPase to cytoplasmic membranes of resting parietal cell cultures and that GFP-VAMP-2 is translocated along with the pump enzyme to the apical plasma membrane after stimulation by histamine. To test the involvement of VAMP-2 in parietal cell activation, they treated SLO-permeabilized glands with tetanus toxin, which is a highly specific protease for VAMP proteins. They demonstrated a correlation between the cleavage of VAMP-2 and the inhibition of glandular acid secretion, confirming an earlier suggestion that the proteolytic cleavage of VAMP-2 inhibited acid secretion in isolated parietal cells that were permeabilized by SLO and stimulated with cAMP (97). Further support for the participation of SNARE proteins in the recruitment of H,K-ATPase is offered by recent studies of Karvar et al., who doubly infected parietal cell cultures with genes constructed with different fluorescent proteins linked to VAMP-2 and SNAP-25 (98). In resting cells, the two proteins were localized to different membrane compartments: VAMP-2 to H,K-ATPase-rich cytoplasmic vesicles, and SNAP-25 to apical membrane vacuoles. Upon stimulation with histamine, the two signals became coincident in the expanded plasma membrane consistent with SNARE complex formation associated with membrane recruitment. Furthermore, introduction of a SNAP-25 construct lacking the functional C terminus inhibited acid secretion by the isolated cells.

# Rab Proteins

In addition to SNARE proteins, small GTPase proteins have long been implicated in vesicular membrane trafficking (99). Studies in several systems, primarily in neuronal synapses, have demonstrated that Rab3 family members redistribute from a membrane-bound location to the soluble cytosolic fraction upon fusion of secretory granules with target plasma membranes. Rab proteins are then recycled back onto mature secretory vesicles after reinternalization of the membrane. Although this cycle is well established for Rab3, far less is known about the functional activity of other Rab proteins during vesicle fusion and recycling. In the gastric parietal cell, there are several Rab proteins, including Rab11 and Rab25 (93, 100, 101). In nonsecreting parietal cells, the Rab11a isoform is associated with H,K-ATPase-containing tubulovesicles that fuse with the apical plasma membrane in response to secretory agonists such as histamine (94).

Using matrix-assisted laser desorption mass spectrometry, Duman et al. (102) confirmed that Rab11 is associated with H,K-ATPase-enriched gastric microsomes, and their data provided a stoichiometric estimate of one Rab11 per six copies of H,K-ATPase. Furthermore, Rab11 exists in at least three forms on rabbit gastric microsomes: The two most prominent resemble Rab11a, whereas the third resembles Rab11b. Using an adenoviral expression system, Duman et al. expressed the dominant-negative mutant Rab11aN124I, in primary cultures of rabbit parietal cells. Rab11aN124I is a mutant of Rab11a in which asparagine (N) at position 124 has been replaced with isoleucine (I). The mutant was well expressed with a
distribution similar to that of H,K-ATPase in resting parietal cells; however, mutant Rab11a arrested the stimulus-dependent morphological transition of the parietal cells and acid secretion measured by aminopyrine uptake. Specificity was verified by addition of tetracycline, which blocked mutant Rab expression and restored the morphological transition and acid secretory function. These studies demonstrate that Rab11a is a prominent GTPase associated with gastric tubulovesicles and suggest that it plays a direct role in regulating parietal cell activation.

In a search for downstream effectors, a number of Rab11-interacting proteins have been identified as co-enriched with Rab11a and H,K-ATPase on parietal cell tubulovesicle membranes: rab11-family interacting protein 1 (rab11-FIP1), rab11-family interacting protein 2 (rab11-FIP2), and pp75/rip11 (103). The binding of rab11-FIP1 and rab11-FIP2 to Rab11a was dependent upon a conserved C-terminal amphipathic α-helix. Moreover, these Rab11-interacting proteins were found to translocate with Rab11a and the H,K-ATPase upon stimulation of parietal cells with histamine. These results suggest that the function of Rab11a in plasma membrane recycling is dependent upon a number of protein effectors.

## Clathrin Coat and Other Adaptor Proteins

An important, though somewhat ignored, aspect of regulating gastric secretion has to do with the uptake and internalization of the extensive apical membrane when the stimulus is withdrawn and the parietal cell returns to the resting state. Given the similarities of regulated H,K-ATPase trafficking with recycling of cargo through the apical recycling endosomes of many epithelial cells, it seems reasonable to speculate that clathrin and its adaptor proteins regulate some part of an apical recycling pathway as in other epithelial cells. Using immunological probes, Okamoto et al. (104) identified γ-adaptin and clathrin heavy chain on tubulovesicles isolated from gastric parietal cells. Further biochemical characterization of the tubulovesicular clathrin adaptor complex suggested a subunit composition including α-, β- and γ-adaptins, as well as other subunits with molecular masses of 50 and 19 kDa, all of which could polymerize in vitro into basket-like structures of ~120 nm diameter (105). For parietal cells in the nonsecreting state, immuno-electron microscopy revealed that clathrin is relatively abundant at or near the apical canalicular membrane specifically in association with coated pits and coated vesicles, as well as accumulated at the ends of tubulovesicular profiles where the membranes are acutely curved. These results indicate that, even in resting cells, active membrane trafficking between the apical membrane and the tubulovesicular compartment is an ongoing process. They are also consistent with an hypothesis that the secretory cycle is regulated with respect to the relative rates of exocytic (stimulation) and endocytic (recycling) processes, rather than a binary on or off system. It must be pointed out that, although clathrin and its adaptors are well represented and appear actively involved in some aspect of apical membrane recycling in the parietal cell, there is only presumptive evidence that H,K-ATPase is the cargo.

Dynamin

Another component of clathrin-dependent trafficking pathways is the large GTPase dynamin, which is essential for receptor-mediated endocytosis and is clearly known to interact with clathrin and coat-forming proteins, but its precise function in vesicle formation remains controversial (106, 107). Given the distribution of clathrin and clathrin adaptors in the parietal cell, it is not surprising that a dynamin-like molecule should be associated with the apical membrane. In fact, dynamin II has been immunolocalized to the apical membrane of both resting and stimulated parietal cells (94, 105). Interestingly, among the various cell types in gastric glands, dynamin appears to be expressed predominantly, if not exclusively, in the parietal cell (105). Although it has been proposed that dynamin acts as a “pinchase” for constriction of endocytic membrane separation from plasma membrane, this remains to be established (107).

Using a GST-dynamin II fusion protein as an affinity matrix, Okamoto et al. identified two proteins that bind to dynamin II, the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase c-src and lasp-1 (108). Moreover, the binding of c-src and lasp-1 was specific for the proline-rich domain of dynamin II. Their study also showed the presence of c-src on tubulovesicular membranes, with an active tyrosine kinase that phosphorylated tubulovesicular proteins in vitro, one of which may be the 100-kDa H,K-ATPase. A potential trafficking role for c-src on tubulovesicular membranes is of interest because c-src has been found on endosomal membranes (109), as a regulator of other apical membrane trafficking pathways (110, 111), and shown to regulate membrane transporters directly by phosphorylation (112). The interaction of lasp-1 with dynamin II is also of interest, suggesting the possibility of some regulatory role for lasp-1 in coordinating the actin cytoskeleton and vesicular trafficking machinery via dynamin (108). As with c-src, the functional consequences of lasp-1 dynamin II interaction remain to be characterized.

Although these interactive data provide interesting possibilities for connection between signaling molecules such as c-src and the downstream effectors, such as dynamin, lasp-1 and even H,K-ATPase, the role of the in vitro protein-protein interactions in parietal cell physiology and their regulation during cell activation remain to be characterized.

Myosin Vb

Given the importance of Rab11a in tubulovesicle trafficking, Lapierre et al. (113) set up a yeast two-hybrid screen for proteins interacting with active Rab11a. Among three Rab11-interacting proteins discovered, one is myosin Vb. These authors further characterized myosin Vb in polarized MDCK cells. They found that myosin Vb is associated with apical endosomes. Furthermore, this association depends on the integrity of microtubules, providing the interesting suggestion of a role for myosin Vb in plasma membrane recycling in connection with the microtubule cytoskeleton. Expression of the C-terminal tail of myosin Vb dispersed the distribution profile of transferrin receptor and retarded recycling of the

receptor back to the plasma membrane. By analogy with a proposed function of myosin Va in melanosome trafficking (114), it is also possible that the mutant disrupted the association of the myosin Vb-endosomal complex with the actin-based cytoskeleton, which resulted in an inhibition of apical plasma membrane recycling.

# Structure and Function of H,K-ATPase

H,K-ATPase shares several structural homologies with another P-type ATPase, Na,K-ATPase (86, 115). They are both composed of an α-subunit, predicted to span the membrane 10 times, and a glycosylated β-subunit of type II integral membrane protein. Early in the biosynthetic pathway, the β-subunits assemble with α-subunits in the endoplasmic reticulum. Assembly of the holoenzyme appears to involve interactions between cytoplasmic, extracytoplasmic and transmembrane domains of both subunits (116, 117) and requires insertion of the α/β complex into the plasma membrane. Although cross-assembly of H,K-ATPase and Na,K-ATPase subunits can occur under contrived in vitro conditions, the α-subunit of each ATPase preferentially assembles with its respective β-subunit (118).

Whereas the amino acid sequence between the H,K-ATPase and Na,K-ATPase is highly conserved, these enzymes differ in several important attributes, including the cations they respectively transport and their targeted locations. The Na,K-ATPase is concentrated at the basolateral membrane of most epithelial cells, whereas, the gastric H,K-ATPase is ultimately targeted to the apical membrane of secreting parietal cells. Also, the H,K-ATPase represents the major cargo protein for the regulated recycling associated with acid secretion.

The recruitment of vesicular coat proteins has been shown to depend upon both the presence of membrane protein cargo and the lipid composition of the target membranes (119). Thus cargo can regulate the formation of vesicular carriers. Complete deletion of either the α-subunit (120) or the β-subunit (121) in knockout mice was shown to have predictably profound effects on parietal cell structure and function. In both cases, the mice were achlorhydric. Although parietal cells were histologically identifiable, both knockout mice exhibited a dramatic diminution of tubulovesicular membranes. The residual amount of β-subunit expressed in the α-subunit knockout mice was not sufficient to produce a tubulovesicular network (120), suggesting that the assembled holoenzyme is required as cargo for the biogenesis of the tubulovesicular compartment.

Expression studies in heterologous cell lines have shown that the α-subunit of the gastric H,K-ATPase encodes sorting and targeting information responsible for the apical distribution of the pumps. By analyzing the sorting behavior of a number of chimeric pumps composed of complementary portions of β-subunits from the H,K-ATPase and Na,K-ATPase, Dunbar et al. (122) identified a portion of the gastric H,K-ATPase, which is sufficient to redirect the normally basolateral Na,K-ATPase to the apical surface in transfected LLC-PK cells. This motif resides within the fourth of the ten predicted transmembrane domains of the α-subunit.

There are seven N-glycosylation sites on the $\beta$-subunit of the H,K-ATPase (123). To examine the role of the carbohydrate chains on holoenzyme activity and stability, Asano et al. (124) carried out site-directed mutagenesis on the $\beta$-subunit in which one, several, or all of the asparagine residues in the N-glycosylation sites were replaced by glutamine. Removing any one of seven carbohydrate chains from the $\beta$-subunit did not have a significant effect on the activity of H,K-ATPase or its delivery to the apical surface. However, removal of all the carbohydrate chains prevented assembly of the holoenzyme and all associated functional activity. In contrast, enzyme activity and $\alpha/\beta$-subunit assembly were retained when three carbohydrate chains were removed, but surface delivery of the $\beta$-subunit and its associated $\alpha$-subunit was arrested, indicating that the surface delivery mechanism is more dependent on the carbohydrate chains than is the expression of H,K-ATPase activity and holoenzyme assembly.

In addition to stabilizing its complementary $\alpha$-subunit, the $\beta$-subunit of H,K-ATPase may contain a tyrosine-based endocytotic motif that is essential for recycling of the pump after withdrawal of stimulation. Courtois-Coutry et al. (73) made transgenic mice that expressed a mutant H,K-ATPase $\beta$-subunit, in which a critical tyrosine residue in the cytoplasmic tail was mutated to alanine. These mice developed a pathology resembling that in idiopathic hypersecretion of acid into the stomach. Immuno-electron microscopy data suggest that the $\beta$-subunit, and presumably the $\alpha$-subunit, in these transgenic mice are constitutively expressed at the apical membrane and fail to re-internalize. The authors concluded that that the mutated $\beta$-subunit, and therefore the pump enzyme, could not interact with the endocytotic machinery to allow re-sequestration of the stimulated apical surface in reversion to the resting state.

Biochemical studies suggest that the cytoskeletal proteins ankyrin and spectrin interact with the H,K-ATPase in the microsomal fraction of resting parietal cells and appear to relocate with H,K-ATPase to the apical plasma membrane of the secreting parietal cells (125). Whereas these authors speculated that ankyrin and spectrin form a functional complex to stabilize H,K-ATPase at the apical membrane upon the stimulation, it would be of great interest to ascertain whether ankyrin and spectrin directly bind to H,K-ATPase and how such interactions are regulated.

## ACTIN-BASED CYTOSKELETON IS ESSENTIAL FOR PARIETAL CELL ACTIVATION

### Actin

Interactions between the plasma membrane and the cytoskeleton play a central role in a variety of physiological processes including mobilization of membrane receptors, endocytosis, exocytosis (e.g., hormone secretion and transmitter release), cell polarity, and morphology (126, 127). An essential role for the cortical actin cytoskeleton in parietal cell secretion has been implied from morphological

analyses (1–3) and from studies with microfilament disrupters such as cytochalasin (128, 129). Highly organized microfilaments are a characteristic feature of microvilli within the canaliculus of the gastric parietal cell. However, the radial arrangement of the actin filaments in proximity to the microvillar membrane in parietal cells (3) is distinctly different from the central core localization of actin filaments of intestinal microvilli (130).

The actin gene family encodes a number of structurally related, but functionally distinct, protein isoforms that modulate contraction in muscle tissues and control shape and motility of nonmuscle cells (131). In mammals, there are at least six different actin isoforms, each encoded by a separate gene, and they differ by <10% of the amino acid sequence, primarily in the N-terminal region (132). The development of cytoplasmic β- and γ-actin isoform-specific antibodies has provided powerful tools for localizing actin isoforms in situ (133).

Using actin isoform-specific antibodies and isolated gastric glands as an epithelial model, Yao et al. (134) demonstrated that actin isoforms, in particular the cytoplasmic β- and γ-actin nonmuscle isoforms, are differentially polarized in epithelial cells. They found that β-actin was predominantly localized to the apical plasma membrane of all glandular cells, including the tortuous microvilli-enriched canicular surface of parietal cells, as well as the entire gland lumen, whereas γ-actin was predominantly localized to the basolateral membrane.

The canaliculi of resting parietal cells are replete with short microvilli that include radially organized actin microfilament bundles projecting along the microvillus and extending one or more micrometers into the cytoplasm (3). The radical membrane transformations of cell activation result in elongation of microvilli, which suggests a commensurate shift in the ratio of monomeric G-actin to filamentous F-actin. However, measurements on the state of actin in gastric glands revealed the following: (a) Parietal cell actin is primarily organized in the F-actin form (90%); (b) the microfilament disrupter cytochalasin D destabilizes the F-actin and inhibits acid secretion; and (c) phalloidin, which stabilizes F-actin filaments, does not inhibit acid secretion (135). Surprisingly, the authors could find no significant change in the ratio of F- to G-actin when the cells were transformed from rest to maximal secretion: F-actin remained about 90% of the total. These data are consistent with an hypothesis that microfilamentous actin is necessary for membrane recruitment underlying parietal cell secretion; however, they suggest that rapid exchange between G- and F-actin is not essential for the secretory process and that the parietal cell maintains actin in a highly polymerized state. This conclusion was underscored by the work of Ammar et al. (136) who tested the actin monomer-sequestering agent latrunculin B (Lat B) on parietal cell structure and function. Lat B inhibited acid secretion and increased the extractable monomeric actin but only at relatively high doses (10–70 μM). Because the authors observed high sensitivity of other parietal cell functions to Lat B (e.g., formation of lamellipodia was inhibited at 0.1 μM), they reasoned that there were distinct pools of exchangeable actin in parietal cells, with microvillar microfilaments being particularly stable owing to the presence of stabilizing, capping, and bundling proteins.
They proposed that the resistance of acid secretory function to Lat B is the result of stable actin filament-turnover pathways that minimize the accessibility of the actin monomer to Lat B.

The actin cytoskeleton has been linked to the mechanism of potentiation of cAMP-mediated acid secretion by carbachol in rabbit gastric glands (137). The observed potentiation was dependent upon release of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ from intracellular stores regulated by the type 3 IP$_3$ receptor (the major subtype in the parietal cell), but it was unaffected by changes in extracellular $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ or inhibitors of either PKC or CAM kinase II. On the other hand, the disrupter of actin filaments, cytochalasin D, preferentially blocked the secretory effect of carbachol and its synergism with cAMP, as well as the release of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ from stores. Treatment of glands with cytochalasin D also caused redistribution of the IP$_3$ receptor from a plasma membrane-like fraction to the microsomal fraction, suggesting a dissociation of the stores from the plasma membrane and a functional coupling between actin filaments and the receptor-mediated $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ store.

## Ezrin-Actin Interactions

An actin-binding/regulatory protein that may have a primary role in parietal cell function was mentioned above as the stimulation-dependent 80-kDa phosphoprotein called ezrin. Ezrin was independently identified by various investigators for their special interests (138–140) and implicated as a cytoskeleton-membrane linker protein. Ezrin is the best studied member of the ERM (ezrin-radixin-moesin) family (141). These proteins share approximately 75% primary sequence identity and contain an N-terminal globular domain followed by an $\alpha$-helical region and a C-terminal tail domain (142). Although ezrin was originally purified with the microfilament bundles from intestinal microvilli, the native, full-length protein possessed no convincing F-actin binding activity in tests that used $\alpha$-actin from skeletal muscle, a commonly used rich source of pure actin. However, C-terminal fragments of ezrin were shown to bind filamentous $\alpha$-actin (143); consequently, Bretscher et al. (142) developed a model of intra- and intermolecular folding of full-length ezrin to account for the discrepancy.

Ezrin was first identified in parietal cells on the basis of PKA-dependent phosphorylation concomitant with stimulation of gastric glands (19, 22). Double immunostaining for ezrin and for $\beta$-actin revealed that these two proteins are abundant and primarily co-localized to the same regions within parietal cells, characteristic of the tortuous apical canalicular surface wending through most of the cell (23, 24, 134). Interestingly, ezrin is almost exclusively localized to parietal cells, whereas staining for the $\beta$-actin isoform is intense along the apical borders of all cell types lining the gland lumen as well as within apical canaliculi of parietal cells. Because the $\gamma$-actin isoform is primarily distributed near the basolateral membrane of parietal cells (134), it appears that ezrin is co-localized with $\beta$-actin, but not $\gamma$-actin, as a subset of the F-actin microfilaments.

On the basis of actin-ezrin cyto-localization studies and the knowledge that $\alpha$-actin is not expressed in parietal cells, Yao et al. (144) hypothesized that ezrinpreferentially binds to nonmuscle actin isoforms rather than to skeletal muscle $\alpha$-actin. Using a co-sedimentation assay that compared purified $\beta$-actin with skeletal muscle $\alpha$-actin, ezrin appeared in the pellet only when $\beta$-actin was polymerized, whereas a known actin-binding protein, the S1 tryptic fragment of myosin II, showed no selectivity between these actin isoforms. The calculated data suggest a stoichiometry of 1 ezrin bound per 12 actin molecules. These studies indicate that gastric ezrin possesses F-actin binding in an isoform-specific manner. In fact, the binding of full-length ezrin to actin was lately demonstrated using a novel solid phase actin-binding assay (145).

In their search for a novel class of pharmacological antiulcer agents, Urushidani et al. (146) reported that a compound designated ME3407, a potent acid secretion inhibitor, arrested the morphological transition of cells stimulated by histamine. Because ME3407 was found to liberate the phosphoprotein ezrin from the apical plasma membrane, as well as to inhibit histamine-triggered translocation of H,K-ATPase, these authors hypothesized that ME3407 may exert its inhibitory action on the modulation of protein phosphorylation required for recruitment of H,K-ATPase. Dephosphorylation of ezrin has been correlated with its dissociation from the plasma membrane-cytoskeleton (147). ME3407 was also observed to inhibit MLCK and PI3 kinase activities measured in vitro (44). Because wortmannin is a well-known inhibitor of these latter kinases, it was tested and found to inhibit glandular acid secretion, similar to the effect of ME3407. Recent studies, however, have differentiated the effects of wortmannin and ME3407 (37). Both compounds were found to inhibit acid secretion by intact gastric glands, but only ME3407 inhibited acid secretion in SLO-permeabilized glands and liberated ezrin from its membrane-cytoskeletal locus at the canalicular surface. Thus it appears that the targets of these two inhibitors are not identical. Future studies may attempt to define whether and to what extent phosphorylation of ezrin might be altered by ME3407 and relate it to the modulation of parietal cell secretion.

## Ezrin Interacts with Other Cellular Proteins

Using an overlay assay, Dransfield et al. (148) showed that ezrin binds to the regulatory RII subunit of PKA in parietal cells, suggesting it might be involved in the functional localization of PKA as an anchoring protein. In addition, the authors showed that the RII subunit of PKA is capable of binding to full-length ezrin in cell extracts, arguing that inter- or intramolecular interaction of ezrin masks ezrin activity in binding to other cellular proteins. It was also reported that the N-terminal domain of ezrin binds to EBP50, which mediates ezrin association with the plasma membrane, although the physiological relevance of such interaction remains to be characterized (144).

In a search for Ca²⁺-mediated signaling events in parietal cell activation, Yao et al. (149) discovered the presence of calpain I ($\mu$-calpain) in gastric parietal cells and its interaction with ezrin. Further studies showed that parietal cell calpain I can be activated by an ionomycin-mediated elevation of intracellular calcium; furthermore, the activation of calpain triggers the release and hydrolysis of ezrin.(149), followed by the collapse of the actin cytoskeleton in parietal cells. These studies suggest the importance of ezrin in the integrity of the actin cytoskeleton of parietal cells. Significantly, the activation of calpain, as evidenced by the hydrolysis of ezrin, was correlated with the inhibition of parietal cell secretion, presumably through the loss of ezrin. This ezrin-calpain interaction is unique because the calpain cleavage site is located to the C-terminal 200 amino acids of ezrin where sequences of the ERM family are divergent. To explore the possible regulation by calcium and calpain I of the interaction between $\beta$-actin and ezrin, Herman and his associates overexpressed calpastatin, an endogenous inhibitor of calpain, in fibroblast cells. The overexpression resulted in a diminished calpain activity and increased ezrin protein level, which was experimentally correlated with an inhibition of filopodial formation (150), suggesting that spatial activation of calpain may be necessary for actin dynamics associated with spreading at the leading edge. It will be of interest to evaluate whether the hydrolysis of ezrin, or the liberation of ezrin from actin cytoskeleton, is essential for formation of cytoplasmic extensions such as filopodia or microvilli.

# A NOTE ON THE FUSION REACTION

Thus far we have discussed the signal transduction events of parietal cell activation in terms of $(a)$ the structural elements (cytoskeleton) that support and promote the translocation of H,K-ATPase-rich membranes from their cytoplasmic location to the apical membrane and $(b)$ the cognitive elements (SNAREs) that assure membranes are directed to and associate with highly specific docking sites. $(c)$ A third and equally important element has generally been given less attention, the fusion mechanism itself, i.e., the means by which two distinct apposing lipid bilayers interact and flow into one. A schematic view of these three cooperative processes contributing to membrane recruitment is shown in Figure 2. The proposal that phospholipid surface chemistry and fusion processes play a role in membrane recruitment and secretion extends back to 1963, when morphological transformations of acid-secreting cells were correlated with phospholipid turnover in bullfrog gastric mucosa (87). Although this was an important step in formulating the membrane recycling hypothesis, little work was done on the fusion process per se until recently. Using separate assays of fluorescence dequenching and intervesicular protein transfer, Duman et al. (151) have demonstrated that gastric tubulovesicular membranes will fuse with each other (homotypic fusion) or with liposomes of the appropriate composition. The fusion reaction is highly specific for a triggering system that must include either Ca${}^{2+}$ or ATP ($\mathrm{EC}_{50}$ is $0.15 \mu \mathrm{M}$ and $1 \mathrm{mM}$, respectively) and is dependent on the presence of protein in at least one of the two vesicular pools, although the specific protein has not been identified. Whereas these in vitro fusion data are preliminary, they do offer a system by which the interfacial reactions of fusion might be studied, with the potential to identify new classes of proteins that facilitate the lipid mixing processes.
PERSPECTIVES

Although great progress has been made over the past 10 years in characterizing the mechanisms and participants in parietal cell secretion, the challenge ahead is to define the precise function and the physiological regulation of the implicated proteins and identify new players (152). By analyzing both the cell biology and physiology of phenotypic changes in cultured parietal cells and even transgenic animals expressing mutant regulatory proteins, it will be possible to determine whether and how a particular molecule operates upon the signaling cascade and downstream effector reactions of parietal cell activation. Molecular engineering of fluorescent reporters on a desired molecule has emerged as an exciting way to correlate the cytological changes to molecular function of individual regulatory proteins in real-time imaging of live parietal cells. Such studies will consolidate protein-protein interactions that have been inferred from indirect techniques into a physiological model for parietal cell activation and relate these data to molecular medicine of associated disorders such as peptic ulcer disease and gastric carcinoma.

Figure 1 Schematic model for regulated tubulovesicle cycling in the parietal cell. In resting cells, the proton pump H,K-ATPase is sequestered in inactive cytoplasmic tubulovesicles (TVs). Secretagogue stimulation triggers the translocation of TVs ultimately leading to activation of proton pumping (solid arrows). Once the stimulus has decayed, the proton pump is internalized to terminate acid secretion (dotted arrows). The regulated TV cycle can be divided into following steps: (a) Docking. TVs that contain H,K-ATPase and intrinsic factors dock at the active zone of the target membrane. H,K-ATPase is inactive owing to low permeability to K⁺. Docking is defined as the initial contact/interaction between vesicle membrane and target membrane mediated by specific proteins, such as VAMP-2, syntaxins, SNAP-25, and exocyst protein complex SEC6/8. Docking can occur between vesicles and apical plasma membrane (heterotypic) and among vesicle membranes themselves (homotypic). (b) Priming. After docking, TVs go through a maturation process that enables competency for membrane fusion, possibly mediated by PKA-dependent phosphorylation and Ca²⁺-dependent activation. (c) Fusion/proton pumping. Lipids of primed TVs are competent to mix with those of the apical membrane allowing H,K-ATPase to partition into the membrane. The proton pump begins active H⁺ transport while TV contents such as intrinsic factor exocytose into the gland lumen. (d) Endocytosis. After the stimulus removal, the H,K-ATPase-rich regions of apical membrane are retrieved into the cytoplasm. The initial internalization is facilitated via clathrin-coated pits and dynamin. (e) Endosome fusion. Coated TVs fuse with apical early endosome. This may be facilitated by small GTPases and their accessory proteins. (f) Budding. TVs are reformed chiefly by budding from recycling endosomes. The newly formed TVs are either competent for translocation and subsequent docking, or committed to a homotypic fusion to gain competence. (g) Translocation. H,K-ATPase-containing TVs translocate back to the active zone either by diffusion or by motor proteins.

Figure 2 Schematic model representing three stages in the membrane recruitment process. $(a)$ The trafficking and migration of cytoplasmic membranes containing cargo transport proteins is facilitated by the cytoskeleton (microfilaments and microtubules) possibly through resident motor proteins. $(b)$ Effective recruitment can occur only where cargo vesicles can recognize and dock on target plasma membranes via highly specific interactive proteins (e.g., SNARE proteins), possibly regulated by small GT-Pases such as the Rab proteins. $(c)$ After the membranes are tightly docked, fusion can occur only when microscopic regions of the two highly distinctive membrane interfaces flow together to form the fusion pore. For biological membranes, the reaction probably involves activation of hydrophobic protein(s) that spans the hydrophilic interface and permits phospholipids to flow into a fusion pore. Phospholipases may also participate. All of these processes are carefully regulated by receptor-mediated signaling events involving protein kinases and phosphatases.
