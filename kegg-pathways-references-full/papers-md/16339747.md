The vascular smooth muscle cell is a highly specialized cell whose primary function is contraction and relaxation. It expresses a variety of contractile proteins, ion channels, and signalling molecules that regulate contraction. Upon contraction, vascular smooth muscle cells shorten, thereby decreasing the diameter of a blood vessel to regulate the blood flow and pressure. Contractile activity in vascular smooth muscle cells is initiated by a Ca²⁺-calmodulin interaction to stimulate phosphorylation of the light chain of myosin. Ca²⁺-sensitization of the contractile proteins is signaled by the RhoA/Rho-kinase pathway to inhibit the dephosphorylation of the light chain by myosin phosphatase, thereby maintaining force. Removal of Ca²⁺ from the cytosol and stimulation of myosin phosphatase initiate the relaxation of vascular smooth muscle. Exp Biol Med 230:829–835, 2005.

Key words: smooth muscle; contraction; vascular; calcium; signaling

Smooth muscle cells constitute the walls of various organs and tubes of the body including blood vessels, stomach, intestines, bladder, airways, uterus, and the penile and clitoral cavernosal sinuses. Smooth muscle derives its name from the fact that it lacks the striated banding pattern that is characteristic of cardiac and skeletal muscle. Smooth muscle cells receive neural innervation from the autonomic nervous system. In addition, the contractile state of smooth muscle is controlled by several hormonal and autocrine/paracrine actions. Smooth muscle cells also develop tonic and phasic contractions in response to changes in load or length. Regardless of the stimulus, smooth muscle cells use cross-bridge cycling (between actin and myosin) to develop force and calcium ions (Ca²⁺) that initiate the underlying molecular signaling that leads to contraction.

The vascular smooth muscle cell is a highly specialized cell whose principal function is contraction. It expresses a variety of contractile proteins, ion channels, and signaling molecules that regulate contraction. On contraction, vascular smooth muscle cells shorten, thereby decreasing the diameter of a blood vessel to regulate the blood flow and pressure. However, this contractile phenotype can differentiate into a synthetic phenotype during, for instance, vasculogenesis, which is characterized by proliferation and production of extracellular matrix components of the arterial wall (1). In this minireview, we focus primarily on the contractile phenotype of vascular smooth muscle cells and describe the molecular-signaling pathways involved in regulating contraction. For a more in-depth outline of the molecular mechanism of smooth muscle contraction and its regulation, the reader is referred to several recently published reviews (2–6).

### The Contractile Mechanism

In the intact body, the process of smooth muscle contraction is principally regulated by pharmacomechanic activation (i.e., activation by ligands of cell surface receptors) and electromechanic activation (i.e., stretch, intraluminal pressure) of the contractile proteins myosin and actin (7). In the latter, a depolarization of the membrane’s resting potential, brought on by the firing of action potentials or by activation of stretch-dependent ion channels and voltage-operated Ca²⁺ channels in the plasma membrane, triggers the influx of Ca²⁺ and ultimately leads
to contraction. Myogenic tone or pressure-induced constriction of arterioles and small-resistance arteries depends on this electromechanic coupling (8, 9). For contraction to occur, myosin light chain (MLC) kinase, activated by Ca²⁺ calmodulin, must phosphorylate Ser 19 of the 20-kDa regulatory MLC, enabling the molecular interaction of myosin with actin (10, 11). Energy released from ATP by myosin ATPase activity results in the cycling of the myosin cross-bridges with actin for contraction (12, 13). Thus, contractile activity in smooth muscle cells is primarily determined by the phosphorylation state of the MLC. In some smooth muscle cells, the phosphorylation of the MLC is maintained at a low level in the absence of external stimuli (i.e., no receptor or mechanical activation; Ref. 14). This activity results in what is known as smooth muscle tone, and its intensity can be varied.

### Ca²⁺-Dependent Contraction of Smooth Muscle

Contraction of smooth muscle is initiated by a Ca²⁺-mediated change in the thick (myosin) filaments, whereas in striated muscle, Ca²⁺ mediates contraction by changes in the thin (actin) filaments. In response to specific stimuli in smooth muscle, the α₁-adrenoceptor agonist norepinephrine released from the sympathetic nerves within the arterial wall for instance, the intracellular concentration of Ca²⁺ rapidly increases and declines to a level that is elevated above basal in the continued presence of the agonist (15). This initial transient increase in cytosolic Ca²⁺ arises from Ca²⁺ released from intracellular stores (sarcoplasmic reticulum), while the latter increase arises from entry from the extracellular space through Ca²⁺ channels (receptor-operated Ca²⁺ channels), as shown by high-resolution confocal imaging (see Ref. 5 for a comprehensive review). The biochemical signals that trigger this Ca²⁺ release are documented in detail (see Refs. 16 and 17 for reviews) and will be described here only briefly. Phospholipase C (PLC) is activated by the heterotrimeric G protein Gα,q on binding of agonists such as norepinephrine, angiotensin II, or endothelin-1 to serpentine receptors on the smooth muscle membrane (Fig. 1). PLC is specific for the membrane lipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate to catalyze the formation of two second messengers: inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP₃) and diacylglycerol (DAG). The binding of IP₃ to receptors on the sarcoplasmic reticulum results in the release of Ca²⁺ into the cytosol. The primary target protein of this initial rise in intracellular Ca²⁺ is believed to be calmodulin, a member of the family of EF hand Ca²⁺-binding proteins (18). The binding of Ca²⁺ to these four EF hands causes a conformational change in the calmodulin molecule, allowing a subsequent interaction with MLC kinase. This association results in a conformational change of the calmodulin-MLC kinase complex, exposing the catalytic site. This sequence of events leads to the activation of MLC kinase and the phosphorylation of Ser 19 of the 20-kDa regulatory MLC (MLC20; Refs. 10, 11).

This figure illustrates the pathway from agonist stimulation to smooth muscle contraction via Ca²⁺ signaling and MLC phosphorylation.
The second messenger, DAG, which is released on agonist-induced and/or stretch-induced PLC activation, activates protein kinase C (PKC), which phosphorylates specific target proteins. There are several isoforms of PKC in smooth muscle such as PKCa and β (those that are DAG dependent and Ca²⁺ dependent) or PKCe (which requires only DAG), and each has a tissue-specific role (e.g., vascular, uterine, intestinal). In many cases, PKC has contraction-promoting effects such as phosphorylation of many kinases including MLC kinase, ERK1/2, Rho-kinase (p160ROCK), and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, as well as various ion channels and ion transporters. Phorbol esters, a group of synthetic compounds known to activate PKC, mimic the action of DAG and cause contraction of smooth muscle.

Finally, L-type Ca²⁺ channels (i.e., voltage-operated Ca²⁺ channels) in the membrane also open in response to the membrane depolarization brought on by stretch of the smooth muscle cell, which is supposed to play an important role in myogenic reactivity and tone (19–21).

### Ca²⁺-Sensitization Mechanism and Contraction of Smooth Muscle

Contractility of vascular smooth muscle is not only regulated by intracellular Ca²⁺, but also by Ca²⁺-independent mechanisms. In addition to the Ca²⁺-dependent activation of MLC kinase, the state of MLC phosphorylation is further regulated by MLC phosphatase, which is also known as myosin phosphatase (16, 22, 23) and removes the high-energy phosphate from the MLC to promote smooth

Figure 2. Ca²⁺-sensitization mechanism and contraction of smooth muscle. Contractility of smooth muscle can also be regulated by Ca²⁺-independent mechanisms involving G-protein-coupled receptor binding. When agonists bind to serpentine receptors on the outer membrane of the smooth muscle, the Rho-GTP is activated by Rho-guanine nucleotide exchange factors. This activated RhoA-GTP binds to and activates Rho kinase, which subsequently phosphorylates the myosin-binding subunit of MLC phosphatase and inhibits its activity, thus promoting the phosphorylated state of MLC that leads to contraction.

muscle relaxation (Fig. 2). There are three subunits of MLC phosphatase: a 37-kDa catalytic subunit (PP1c), a small noncatalytic subunit of unknown function (24), and a 110- kDa to 130-kDa myosin-binding subunit (MYPT1). The binding of MYPT1 to PP1c inhibits the enzymatic activity of MLC phosphatase, allowing the MLC to remain phosphorylated and, thereby, promoting contraction (25). Experiments have shown that activated G-proteins are involved in the signaling pathway for this Ca²⁺ sensitization because GTPγS, a nonhydrolyzable GTP analog, increases MLC phosphorylation and potentiates contraction. GTPγS was also demonstrated to decrease the rate of MLC dephosphorylation, which is consistent with an overall decrease in MLC phosphatase activity (26). Subsequent experiments have shown that the small G protein RhoA and its downstream target Rho kinase play an important role in the regulation of MLC phosphatase activity (27). RhoA is a monomeric G-protein that can be activated by several agonists including angiotensin II (28). Its activity is regulated by the binding of GTP, a transition facilitated by Rho-guanine nucleotide exchange factors (Rho-GEFs) that enable the exchange of nucleotide to activate RhoA-GDP to RhoA-GTP (29). This activated RhoA-GTP binds to and activates Rho kinase, a serine/threonine kinase (30), which subsequently phosphorylates the myosin-binding subunit of MLC phosphatase (MYPT1) and inhibits its activity (31) and, thus, promotes the phosphorylated state of the MLC (Fig. 2). A translocation of Rho kinase and RhoA to the cell membrane has been shown to occur on agonist activation (16, 32); however, how Rho kinase might regulate the dephosphorylation of myosin in the core of

the cell is unknown. It might involve dissociation of MYPT1 and PP1c on the membrane, thereby decreasing MLC phosphatase activity (33). Pharmacologic inhibitors of Rho kinase, such as fasudil, Y-27632, and HA-1077, block its activity by competing with the ATP-binding site on the enzyme (34–36). Rho kinase inhibition induces the relaxation of isolated segments of smooth muscle that are contracted by a variety of agonists (37, 38). In the intact animal, the pharmacologic inhibitors of Rho kinase have been shown to cause relaxation of smooth muscle in arteries, resulting in a blood pressure-lowering effect (27, 39).

Several recent studies suggest a role for additional regulators of MLC kinase and phosphatase (16, 23, 40). The small protein CPI-17, once phosphorylated, is able to bind to the catalytic subunit of MLC phosphatase (PP1c) to inhibit the enzyme’s activity (41, 42). CPI-17 is expressed in mammalian vascular smooth muscle (43, 44), which also serves as a substrate for both Rho-kinase and PKC (44). Thus, Ca²⁺ sensitization may involve Rho-kinase-mediated and/or PKC-mediated phosphorylation of CPI-17 to increase MLC20 phosphorylation and prolong smooth muscle contraction (Fig. 3).

Calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II promotes smooth muscle relaxation by decreasing the sensitivity of MLC kinase for Ca²⁺. Additionally, the 17-kDa protein telokin mediates Ca²⁺ desensitization through activation of myosin phosphatase in smooth muscle cells, which leads to a decreased MLC phosphorylation and smooth muscle contraction (45, 46; Fig. 3).

An important question facing the smooth muscle physiologist is: what is the link between receptor occupation

Figure 3. Additional regulators of MLC kinase and phosphatase. Phosphorylated CPI-17 is able to bind to the catalytic subunit of myosin phosphatase to inhibit the enzyme's activity, resulting in prolonged smooth muscle contraction. Both Rho-kinase and protein kinase C can activate CPI-17. Furthermore, calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II promotes smooth muscle cell relaxation by decreasing the sensitivity of MLC kinase for Ca²⁺. The small protein telokin mediates Ca²⁺ desensitization through activation of myosin phosphatase, leading to a decrease in MLC phosphorylation and, therefore, promoting smooth muscle cell relaxation.

and activation of the Ca²⁺-sensitizing activity of the RhoA/  
Rho kinase-signaling cascade? Currently, it is thought that  
receptors activate a heterotrimeric G protein that is coupled  
to RhoA/Rho kinase signaling *via* RhoGEFs. Because  
RhoGEFs facilitate the activation of RhoA, they regulate  
the duration and intensity of signaling *via* heterotrimeric G  
protein–receptor coupling. There are approximately 70  
RhoGEFs in the human genome (47) and three RhoGEFs  
have been identified in smooth muscle: PDZ-RhoGEF,  
LARG (leukemia-associated RhoGEF), and p115-RhoGEF.  
Increased expression and/or activity of RhoGEF proteins  
could augment contractile activation of smooth muscle and,  
therefore, play a role in diseases such as hypertension and  
asthma, where an augmented response contributes to the  
pathophysiology. Recent observations from our laboratory  
showed an involvement of reactive oxygen species in Ca²⁺  
sensitization by activation of RhoA and a subsequent  
increase in Rho kinase activity, providing a direct link  
between reactive oxygen species and the RhoA/Rho kinase  
signaling pathway in the pathogenesis of hypertension (48).

### Other Mechanisms of Smooth Muscle Cell Contraction

It has been proposed that actin filament rearrangement  
or remodeling may play a role in smooth muscle cell  
contraction (49, 50). The hypothesis assumes that actin-  
myosin interactions cause the initial development of force  
and a “gluing” of actin filaments to attachment sites where  
they assemble in dense bodies to form a cytoskeletal  
scaffold that maintains tension in the absence of further  
cross-bridge cycling. Indeed, disruption of actin filaments  
has been associated with reduced agonist-induced Ca²⁺  
signaling (51). Caldesmon and calponin are actin-associated  
proteins that have been shown to inhibit actomyosin ATPase  
activity (52, 53). Caldesmon has proven capable of  
regulating force in smooth muscle (52). Furthermore, the  
inhibitory effect of caldesmon on the actomyosin ATPase  
activity can be reversed by phosphorylation, indicating a  
regulation mechanism of its inhibitory action (54). Others  
have shown that both extracellular signal-related kinase  
(ERK) MAP kinase and p38 MAP kinase are activated  
during agonist-induced smooth muscle stimulation. The  
activation of ERK MAP kinase leads to the phosphorylation  
of caldesmon (55), while p38 MAP kinase increases the  
phosphorylation and activation of heat-shock protein 27  
(HSP27; Ref. 56). Interestingly, HSP27 is a known  
regulator of actin polymerization (57), suggesting that actin  
rearrangement is an important event in the mechanism of  
force maintenance during smooth muscle contraction.

Other cytoskeletal proteins such as microtubules have  
been demonstrated to play a role in vascular smooth muscle  
contraction. Microtubule depolymerization was shown to  
enhance agonist-induced contraction of isolated aortic rings  
(58) and increased myogenic tone in isolated cremaster  
arterioles (59). Our group found that Rho-kinase activation  

facilitated this enhanced contraction (60, 61). Overall, these  
data indicate that cytoskeletal rearrangement is crucial  
during prolonged smooth muscle contraction and that these  
events might play an important role in arterial remodeling  
during vascular pathologies, such as hypertension.

### Concluding Remarks

Layers of smooth muscle cells line the walls of various  
organs and tubes, and the contractile function of smooth  
muscle is under voluntary control. The contractile response  
is initiated by a rapid and transient increase in intracellular  
Ca²⁺ followed by a Ca²⁺-calmodulin interaction to stimulate  
phosphorylation of the MLC. To enable force maintenance,  
a Ca²⁺ sensitization of the contractile proteins is signaled by  
the RhoA/Rho kinase pathway, in concert with other  
proteins like CPI-17, to inhibit the dephosphorylation of  
the MLC phosphatase. Understandably, removal of Ca²⁺  
from the cytosol and stimulation of myosin phosphatase  
initiates the process of smooth muscle relaxation.

Alterations in the regulatory processes maintaining  
intracellular Ca²⁺ and MLC phosphorylation have been  
proposed as possible sites that contribute to the abnormal  
contractile events in smooth muscle cells of various organs  
and tissues. Increases in the activity of RhoA/Rho kinase  
signaling lead to increased contractile responses that may  
contribute to erectile dysfunction (62) in the penis and  
clitoris. Increased activity of the RhoA/Rho kinase signaling  
pathway may also contribute to augmented contraction or  
spastic behavior of smooth muscle in diseases such as  
hypertension, asthma, or atherosclerosis (27, 39, 63–66).
