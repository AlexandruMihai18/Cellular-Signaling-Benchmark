The role of junctional adhesion molecules in vascular inflammation

Christian Weber*, Line Fraemohs* and Elisabetta Dejana†

Abstract | Junctional adhesion molecules (JAMs) of the immunoglobulin superfamily are important in the control of vascular permeability and leukocyte transmigration across endothelial-cell surfaces, by engaging in homophilic, heterophilic and lateral interactions. Through their localization on the endothelial-cell surface and expression by platelets, JAMs contribute to adhesive interactions with circulating leukocytes and platelets. Antibody-blocking studies and studies using genetically modified mice have implicated these functions of JAMs in the regulation of leukocyte recruitment to sites of inflammation and ischaemia–reperfusion injury, in growth-factor-mediated angiogenesis, atherogenesis and neointima formation. The comparison of different JAM-family members and animal models, however, shows that the picture remains rather complex. This Review summarizes recent progress and future directions in understanding the role of JAMs as ‘gate keepers’ in inflammation and vascular pathology.

Adherens junctions
Specialized intercellular junctions of the plasma membrane, in which the cadherin molecules at the surface of adjacent cells interact in a calcium-dependent manner. Actin filaments are linked to these cadherin structures through catenin molecules that are located beneath the junctions.

Leukocyte extravasation from the blood flow and into sites of tissue inflammation is a rigorously controlled process involving the multistep action of traffic signals and adhesion molecules that mediate rolling, adhesion and transendothelial migration (BOX 1). Endothelial cells are tightly connected through various proteins, which regulate the organization of the junctional complex and bind to cytoskeletal proteins or cytoplasmic interaction partners that allow the transfer of intracellular signals. Moreover, an important role for these junctional proteins in governing the transendothelial migration of leukocytes under normal or inflammatory conditions has emerged, and molecular components of both adherens junctions and tight junctions have been implicated in this process. Along the intercellular cleft, different adhesion molecules have been proposed to act sequentially during leukocyte transmigration¹⁻³. Among these, junctional adhesion molecules (JAMs) may support leukocyte recruitment when redistributed to the luminal surface under inflammatory conditions and may promote leukocyte movement through intercellular junctions. However, there are considerable distinctions among the members of the JAM family, and it remains unclear whether and how these proteins may act together to modulate endothelial permeability for circulating cells. JAM-family members have only recently gained attention for their specific contribution to vascular pathology. Here, we discuss the growing body of evidence that supports a role for JAMs in vascular inflammation to set the stage for ongoing and future investigations.

The JAM family
Classification, structural features and expression. The first JAM to be identified at tight junctions of both endothelial and epithelial cells was JAM-A¹,⁴ (also known as JAM, JAM-1, 106 antigen and F11R)⁵,⁶. This was followed by the identification of the closely related molecules JAM-B (also known as JAM2, VE-JAM, hJAM2 and mJAM-3)⁷,⁸ and JAM-C (also known as JAM3, hJAM3 and mJAM-2)⁹⁻¹¹. Most recently JAM4 (REF. 12) and JAM-like (JAML; also known as AMICA1)¹³ have been identified (BOX 2).

All the JAMs have an extracellular domain with two immunoglobulin-like (membrane-distal V-type and membrane-proximal C2-type) domains, a single transmembrane segment and a short cytoplasmic tail with a PDZ-domain-binding motif (Phe-Leu-Val) (FIG. 1a). JAM-A contains a single disulphide bridge in each immunoglobulin-like domain, whereas JAM-B and JAM-C contain an additional disulphide bridge in the C2-type domain, which may impart structural constraints. The crystal structures of the extracellular domains of mouse JAM-A¹⁴ and human JAM-A¹⁵ have been resolved to reveal that a short linker sequence Val-Leu-Val connects the immunoglobulin-like domains to

impose a bent 125° conformation, which is stabilized by hydrogen bonding. The membrane-distal V-type domain of JAM-A contains an Arg-Val-Glu dimerization motif that is involved in homodimer formation<sup>14</sup>. The cytoplasmic tail of JAM-A contains a putative site for phosphorylation by protein kinase C, and the carboxy-terminal PDZ-domain-binding motif is involved in intracellular signal transduction and binding of cytoplasmic molecules as outlined below.

The expression of JAM-A has been shown on the surface of endothelial and epithelial cells of various tissues, including the liver, kidney, pancreas, heart, brain, lymph nodes, intestine, lungs, placenta and vascular tissue<sup>5,16</sup>. In addition, JAM-A is present on circulating cells, such as platelets, monocytes, lymphocytes and neutrophils, as well as on antigen-presenting cells, such as macrophages and dendritic cells<sup>6,16</sup>. JAM-B and JAM-C are expressed by endothelial cells and are specifically enriched in certain vessels, such as high endothelial venules and lymphatics<sup>7</sup>. Unlike JAM-A, JAM-B is not expressed by leukocytes<sup>7</sup>, whereas human JAM-C is expressed by platelets, monocytes, natural killer cells, dendritic cells, B cells and a subset of T cells<sup>11,17,18</sup>. JAM-C however has not been detected on mouse leukocytes<sup>17,19</sup>. In endothelial and epithelial cells, JAMs are localized at intercellular contacts, where they participate in the assembly and maintenance of junctions, signalling to cytoskeleton-associated proteins and recruiting cell-polarity proteins to the junctions via their PDZ-domain-binding motif. JAM-A is apically positioned at tight junctions<sup>5,16</sup> and associates with the tight-junction components cingulin and occludin, with the PDZ-domain-containing proteins

ZO1 (zona occludens 1), AF6 (afadin-6), PARD3 (partitioning defective 3; also known as PAR3) or with CASK (calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine protein kinase), all of which can act as scaffolds for larger complexes<sup>20–22</sup>. Although JAM-C has been detected in epithelial-cell desmosomes<sup>23</sup>, the association of JAM-C (and JAM-B) with ZO1 or PARD3 indicates a prominent localization in endothelial-cell tight junctions<sup>9,24</sup>. Mutation of the serine residue at position 281 in the JAM-C cytoplasmic tail was recently found to abolish JAM-C localization to tight junctions and cell polarity, whereas it stimulated integrin-mediated cell migration<sup>25</sup>.

**Distribution and expression under inflammatory conditions.** The involvement of JAMs in leukocyte recruitment is supported by reports showing that JAMs undergo redistribution within the cell and are upregulated under inflammatory or ischaemic conditions. *In vitro*, co-stimulation of endothelial cells with the cytokines tumour-necrosis factor (TNF) and interferon-γ (IFNγ), rather than significantly regulating *de novo* transcription, leads to a redistribution of JAM-A from intercellular junctions to the apical surface, where it is accessible to support the adhesion of leukocytes<sup>26,27</sup>. It seems that the role of JAM-A in transmigration of leukocytes is not compromised by its subcellular distribution away from the junctions<sup>26,28</sup>; this is possibly due to the migration of leukocytes towards the junction along a haptotactic gradient. JAM-A also redistributes to the endothelial-cell surface in response to basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF; also known as FGF2)<sup>29</sup>, whereas JAM-C partly redistributes from interendothelial-cell contacts to the

### Box 1 | The leukocyte-extravasation cascade

Leukocyte extravasation from the blood into inflamed tissues follows a multistep cascade that involves the sequential action of molecular signals and adhesion molecules (see figure). Selectins (such as P-selectin and E-selectin) initiate leukocyte tethering and rolling along inflamed endothelium. Rolling slows down circulating leukocytes, bringing them into close proximity with endothelial cells and allowing binding of chemokines (such as CC-chemokine ligand 5 and CXC-chemokine ligand 8 (also known as IL-8)) that are displayed on inflamed endothelium to their specific G-protein-coupled chemokine receptors on leukocytes. Activation of chemokine receptors triggers intracellular signalling pathways that activate leukocyte integrins. Interactions between integrins and their immunoglobulin ligands expressed on the endothelium mediate the firm adhesion of leukocytes. The interactions between β<sub>2</sub>-integrins and their ligand intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1) and between the integrin very late antigen 4 (VLA4) and its ligand vascular cell-adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM1) are of crucial importance for leukocyte adhesion. Leukocytes are directed by immobilized chemokines under flow (chemohe taxis) or by chemokine gradients to migrate across the endothelium and into the inflamed tissue.

### Tight junctions
A belt-like region of adhesion between adjacent epithelial or endothelial cells that regulates paracellular flux. Tight-junction proteins include the integral membrane proteins occludin and claudin, in association with cytoplasmic zonula occludens proteins.

### High endothelial venule
A specialized venule that occurs in secondary lymphoid organs, except the spleen. HEVs allow continuous transmigration of lymphocytes as a consequence of the constitutive expression of adhesion molecules and chemokines at their luminal surface.

### Desmosome
An adhesive junction that connects epithelial cells in stratified squamous tissues. These junctions are composed of multiple protein subunits and are the points where keratin filaments are inserted into the plasma membrane.

### Haptotactic gradient
A substrate-bound gradient that promotes directed migration of adherent cells.

### Atherosclerotic plaque
An atherosclerotic lesion consisting of a fibrotic cap surrounding a lipid-rich core. The lesion is the site of inflammation, lipid accumulation and cell death. It is also known as an atheroma.

### Ischaemia-reperfusion injury
An injury in which the tissue first suffers from hypoxia as a result of severely decreased, or completely arrested, blood flow. Restoration of normal blood flow then triggers inflammation, which exacerbates the tissue damage.

Box 2 | Junctional proteins related to the JAM family

The junctional adhesion molecules (JAMs) belong to the cortical thymocyte Xenopus (CTX) subfamily of proteins that have two immunoglobulin-like domains in the extracellular domain. Additional proteins belonging to this family have been identified at cell–cell junctions. Endothelial-cell-selective adhesion molecule (ESAM) is expressed by endothelial cells and localizes to tight junctions, where it mediates homophilic interactions similar to the JAM interactions. In addition, ESAM is expressed by activated platelets⁷⁶. At endothelial-cell tight junctions, ESAM participates in neutrophil transmigration, possibly by influencing endothelial-cell contacts⁷⁷. ESAM is closely related to coxsackie virus and adenovirus receptor (CXADR; also known as CAR), which localizes to the tight junctions of endothelial and epithelial cells⁷⁸,⁷⁹ and associates with the junctional scaffolding proteins zonula occludens 1 (ZO1)⁷⁸, multi-PDZ-domain protein 1 (MUPP1; also known as MPDZ)⁸⁰ and JAM-C⁸¹. CXADR also forms homodimers and contributes to the barrier function of tight junctions⁷⁸. ESAM and CXADR both have large cytoplasmic domains of about 107–120 amino acids with a carboxy-terminal class I PDZ-domain-binding motif. This is in contrast to JAM-A, JAM-B and JAM-C, which all have small cytoplasmic domains of about 40–49 amino acids and a class II PDZ-domain-binding motif. The recently identified JAM-family members JAM4 (REF. 12) and JAM-like (JAML)¹³ are more closely related to ESAM and CXADR, than to JAM-A, JAM-B and JAM-C. JAM4 and JAML are also expressed at cell–cell junctions and probably engage in homophilic interactions.

Surface plasmon resonance  
The detection of alterations in plasmon waves generated at a metal–liquid interface. Changes in surface plasmon resonance are a function of the mass of molecules bound to the interface, so this technique allows sensitive detection of ligand binding in real time without requiring the chemical modification of ligands to enable their detection.

Homophilic and heterophilic interactions in trans and cis. Crystal structures have revealed that JAM-A molecules form homodimers in *cis* via the dimerization motif Arg-Val-Glu in the membrane-distal V-type domains. The positioning of this dimerization motif, together with the bent conformation of JAM-A imposed by the linker between the immunoglobulin domains, results in homodimers that emerge from the cell surface in the shape of an inverted ‘U’ (FIG. 1b). At intercellular junctions, these JAM-A *cis*-homodimers bind in *trans* to JAM-A homodimers on the surface of neighbouring cells¹⁴. The *cis*-dimerization motif is conserved between JAM-A, JAM-B (Arg-Leu-Glu) and JAM-C (Arg-Ile-Glu), implying that JAM-B and JAM-C may dimerize in a similar way and that these motifs may also be involved in heterophilic dimerization.

The position of JAMs at intercellular contacts favours their homophilic engagement in *trans* with molecules on adjacent cells (FIG. 2). When expressed in CHO (Chinese hamster ovary) cells or MDCK (Madin–Darby canine kidney) cells, JAMs localize exclusively to the sites of contact between transfected cells but are absent from contacts between transfected and non-transfected cells⁵,³⁵,³⁶. Homophilic interactions of JAM-A have been confirmed biochemically using recombinant soluble JAM-A³⁷. Interactions in *trans* can be blocked by a monoclonal antibody specific for the dimeric state of JAM-A, which shows that *cis*-dimer formation probably precedes adhesive interactions in *trans*³⁷. Endothelial-cell JAM-A can support homophilic interactions in *trans* with platelet JAM-A³⁸. Recently, homophilic binding of JAM-C was demonstrated using surface plasmon resonance³⁹. Notably, heterophilic interactions in *trans* among JAM-family members have been reported for JAM-B and JAM-C¹⁰. *In vitro*, monomeric JAM-B can competitively substitute JAM-C in homodimers to form JAM-B –JAM-C heterodimers, which indicates that JAM-C has significantly higher affinity for heterodimerization with JAM-B than for homodimerization⁴⁰. Whether JAM-A can also engage in heterophilic interactions with other JAM proteins remains to be determined.

The homophilic interactions of JAMs influence the permeability of endothelial-cell or epithelial-cell layers and are therefore an important component of inflammatory reactions⁵,⁴¹,⁴². The local inflammatory reaction is characterized by an initial increase in blood flow to the site of injury, increased vascular permeability, effusion of osmotically active plasma proteins with subsequent tissue oedema, and the ordered and directional influx and selective accumulation of different effector cells from the peripheral blood at the site of injury. Homophilic JAM-A interactions stabilize cellular junctions, decrease paracellular permeability and regulate barrier functions¹⁶,⁴³. By contrast, studies of JAM-C expression in MDCK cells and JAM-C-deficient microvascular endothelial cells revealed that JAM-C causes an increase in permeability by competitive binding or by destabilizing vascular endothelial-cadherin junctions³⁵,⁴⁴. Preferential expression of JAM-A, JAM-B or JAM-C in different vascular compartments may therefore contribute to the heterogeneity and specific properties

A dimerization motif Arg-(Val/Leu/Ile)-Glu in the membrane-distal domain is essential for homodimer formation. **b** | A molecular model for homophilic interactions of JAMs has been proposed. In this model¹⁴, JAM-A molecules form homodimers in *cis* (via the dimerization motif in the membrane-distal immunoglobulin domain) that emerge from the cell surface in the shape of an inverted ‘U’. At intercellular junctions, these *cis*-homodimers bind in *trans* to JAM-A homodimers from an adjacent cell surface.

JAMs and the control of leukocyte recruitment

Role of JAMs in leukocyte adhesion and transendothelial migration. The first evidence for a role of JAMs in leukocyte-endothelial-cell interactions and transendothelial migration of leukocytes came from studies using the blocking monoclonal antibody BV11, which is specific for mouse JAM-A. This antibody inhibits monocyte transmigration *in vitro* and reduces neutrophil recruitment in some but not all mouse models of inflammation, such as peritonitis and cytokine-induced meningitis but not bacterial meningitis<sup>5,45,46</sup>. Because BV11 preferentially recognizes JAM-A homodimers<sup>37</sup>, binding of leukocytes to endothelial-cell JAM-A dimers may be relevant for their recruitment. Subsequent studies have shown that JAM-A on endothelial cells mediates the lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 (LFA1; also known as α<sub>L</sub>β<sub>2</sub>)-dependent transendothelial diapedesis of T cells and neutrophils, as well as the arrest of monocytes and T cells under shear-flow conditions following cytokine-stimulated redistribution of JAM-A<sup>27</sup>. The contribution of endothelial-cell JAM-A was confirmed using JAM-A-deficient endothelial cells, which were less effective in promoting the arrest and transmigration of monocytes<sup>47</sup>.

A role for JAMs in leukocyte-endothelial-cell interactions was corroborated by other reports. *In vitro*, endothelial-cell monolayers transfected to overexpress JAM-C support increased transmigration of lymphocytes. In turn, lymphocyte transmigration across these endothelial-cell monolayers was blocked by a monoclonal antibody specific for JAM-C or by a soluble form of JAM-C<sup>17</sup>. JAM-C has also been assigned a role in transendothelial migration of neutrophils, which can also be inhibited by the JAM-C-specific monoclonal antibody or by soluble JAM-C *in vitro* and in a mouse model of acute inflammatory peritonitis<sup>48</sup>. As its presence seems to increase permeability, the effects of blocking JAM-C may be attributable to an impairment of reverse leukocyte egression, which accounts overall for a net decrease in transmigration.

Crosstalk of JAMs and integrins during leukocyte recruitment. Members of the JAM family have been shown to interact with leukocyte integrins (FIG. 2), which is particularly intriguing given the importance of integrins in inflammation. For example, JAM-A has been shown to be a ligand for the leukocyte β<sub>2</sub>-integrin LFA1 (REF. 27). This interaction is mediated by the open active I-domain in the α<sub>L</sub> subunit of LFA1 (REF. 49), which binds to the membrane-proximal immunoglobulin-domain of JAM-A on endothelial cells, as shown using domain-deletion mutants<sup>27</sup>. Initial data from yeast two-hybrid assays further implied *cis* interactions between the cytoplasmic tails of leukocyte JAM-A and LFA1 (REF. 27). Likewise, endothelial-cell JAM-A has been found to interact in *cis* with the integrin α<sub>V</sub>β<sub>3</sub> expressed by endothelial cells<sup>29,50</sup>. Indirect interactions may also occur, as JAM-A regulates the activity of β<sub>1</sub>-integrins through the small GTPase RAP1 (REF. 42). A link between JAM-A and RAP1 may be provided by the PDZ-domain-containing protein AF6, which interacts with both JAM-A<sup>21</sup> and RAP1 (REF. 51).

Figure 2 | Cellular expression and extracellular ligands of JAMs. Junctional adhesion molecule A (JAM-A), JAM-B and JAM-C expressed by endothelial cells, leukocytes and platelets support various homophilic and heterophilic interactions. JAM interactions that have been reported in the published literature are indicated with solid lines and predicted interactions are indicated with dashed lines. **a** | At endothelial-cell junctions, JAMs support both homophilic and heterophilic interactions. JAMs on endothelial cells also bind integrins expressed on leukocytes. The integrin lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 (LFA1) interacts with JAM-A, very late antigen 4 (VLA4) interacts with JAM-B, and MAC1 interacts with JAM-C. **b** | Binding of leukocytes to the endothelium is supported by interactions between integrins and JAMs. JAM-A homophilic interactions support platelet adhesion to the endothelium and JAM-C heterophilic interactions with integrins support platelet adhesion to leukocytes.

of intercellular junctional complexes. For example, JAM-A is highly expressed in the brain vascular system and may contribute to the tightly sealed junctions in this tissue, whereas JAM-C is highly expressed in lymph nodes, where interendothelial-cell junctions are more permeable. Likewise, apical redistribution of JAM-A<sup>26</sup> or an upregulation of JAM-C expression may conversely affect permeability during inflammation.

Vascular endothelial cadherin  
An endothelial-cell-specific cadherin (adhesive protein) that is present in adherens junctions, which are located between endothelial cells.
JAM-B is a ligand for the integrin very late antigen 4 (VLA4; also known as α₄β₁)⁵². Domain-deletion studies showed that VLA4 binds to the membrane-distal immunoglobulin-domain of JAM-B, which contains the main binding sites for both JAM-C and VLA4. The interaction of endothelial-cell JAM-B with VLA4 requires prior binding of JAM-B to leukocyte JAM-C and is therefore restricted to cells that co-express VLA4 and JAM-C⁵². Apart from its role in binding JAM-B, JAM-C has been identified as a ligand for the leukocyte integrins MAC1 (also known as α~M~β₂) and α~X~β₂ (REFS 18,23). The interaction of endothelial-cell JAM-C and MAC1 on leukocytes can be modulated by JAM-B–JAM-C heterophilic interactions⁴⁰.

Whereas steady-state JAM-C has a higher affinity for heterodimerization with JAM-B than for homodimerization, heterophilic interactions between endothelial-cell JAM-B and JAM-C at the junction may be temporarily discontinued during transmigration to allow engagement of JAMs with leukocyte integrins (FIG. 3a). Conversely, disruption of JAM-B–JAM-C heterodimers with a JAM-C-specific antibody releases JAM-C, which relocates to the apical endothelial-cell surface, where it becomes available for binding by MAC1, providing an additional mechanism for leukocyte adhesion. Furthermore, endothelial-cell JAM-C seems to facilitate leukocyte transmigration that is related to increased permeability of specialized monolayers, such as high endothelial venules¹⁷,⁴⁴. This increase in permeability is obviously restricted to one direction (apical-to-basal), as blocking JAM-C reduces transmigration, an effect possibly conferred by allowing egression of leukocytes via basal access to the junctions. Therefore, JAM-C may be a gate keeper that prevents reverse egression. Specific overexpression of endothelial-cell JAM-C *in vivo* leads to inflammatory leukocyte recruitment owing to increased JAM-C-dependent adhesion and migration¹⁹. This may be due to interactions with its receptor MAC1 or by structural effects on the junction. It remains to be explored whether heterodimeric interactions of JAM-A with other JAMs occur, whether other interactions of JAMs and integrins in *cis* contribute to the crosstalk and how this is relevant in distinct vascular beds. So, interactions at the junctional ‘zipper’ under inflammatory conditions may serve to release steady-state complexes and to provide traction points for the integrin-driven migration machinery passing through the junctional ‘pinhole’.

**Mechanistic model of coordinated JAM-A interactions.** A model of coordinated JAM-A interactions in leukocyte transmigration has evolved from a previously proposed concept³. Being strategically located at intercellular junctions, JAMs are ideally suited to facilitate or direct the passage of leukocytes across the endothelial-cell barrier by establishing homophilic and heterophilic interactions with leukocytes (FIG. 3b). Transendothelial leukocyte migration requires a temporary opening of the adhesive complex at tight junctions. Indeed, endothelial-cell JAM-A has been shown to co-localize with leukocyte LFA1 in ring-like structures around the penetrating pseudopod at the junctional interface between transmigrating neutrophils and

endothelial cells⁵³. Studies of transfectants expressing a mutant form of LFA1 provided evidence that chemokine-triggered mononuclear-cell transmigration requires dynamic regulation of LFA1 affinity⁵⁴,⁵⁵. In emigrating neutrophils, LFA1 transiently redistributes into a ring-like cluster before localizing to the trailing uropod as transmigration is completed. However, this may be specific for neutrophils or may not reflect the distribution of high-affinity LFA1, as this portion of molecules mainly localizes to a mid-region of the surface of T cells that are migrating on LFA1 ligands, termed the focal zone, whereas the leading edge and uropod contain the lowest levels of high-affinity LFA1⁵⁶. During the transmigration of neutrophils through activated endothelium that expresses many different chemokines to trigger LFA1 activation, junctional JAM-A is redistributed around the site of penetration, forming a complete or partial ring⁵³. This is endorsed by findings that treatment of neutrophils with phorbol ester, which, unlike chemokines, does not provide directional cues nor does it elicit a substantial high-affinity subset of LFA1 but rather alters its avidity and mobility, did not result in the recruitment or enrichment of JAM-A to the endothelial-cell interface of neutrophil adhesion and at the same time prevented diapedesis⁵³. This indicates that phorbol ester may interfere with JAM-A redistribution that is possibly triggered by chemokines on activated endothelium. Therefore, it is conceivable that a transient induction of high-affinity LFA1 with an open I-domain (evoked by chemokine signals, for example) is crucial for its interaction with endothelial-cell JAM-A at sites of leukocyte transmigration.

Although studies using JAM-A-deficient endothelial cells, a blocking polyclonal antibody against JAM-A or genetic deletion of endothelial-cell JAM-A in mice revealed an important contribution of endothelial-cell JAM-A to leukocyte transmigration, attempts to interfere with the functions of JAM-A in transmigration using a monoclonal antibody specific for JAM-A that inhibits re-assembly of endothelial-cell junctions were unsuccessful⁵³. This could be because this monoclonal antibody is directed to the membrane-distal domain of JAM-A that is involved in homodimerization but that is not involved in heterotypic interactions with the active I-domain of LFA1. Accordingly, the blocking monoclonal antibody BV11, which is effective in disrupting transmigration, can bind JAM-A in a region that is distinct to that required for homodimerization¹⁴. In the absence of JAM-A, the recruitment of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1) to the junctions may complement the function of JAM-A as an LFA1 ligand. Provided that JAM-A homodimers bind in *trans* to those on neighbouring cells via the membrane-distal domain, a model emerges in which LFA1 captures the membrane-proximal JAM-A domain via its I-domain to disrupt homophilic JAM-A interactions. This is also supported by recent findings using atomic force microscopy, which indicate that the JAM-A heterophilic interaction with LFA1 is better able to resist pulling forces than the JAM-A homophilic interaction, and imply that the binding of LFA1 to the homophilic JAM-A complex might lead to its disruption⁵⁷. After their binding to LFA1, endothelial-cell JAM-A homodimers

Figure 3 | Molecular models of JAM-A and JAM-C in leukocyte adhesion and transmigration. a | At endothelial-cell junctions, junctional adhesion molecule C (JAM-C) engages in heterophilic interactions with JAM-B. After opening of the junctional complex, endothelial-cell JAM-C supports the adhesion and diapedesis of leukocytes by interacting with leukocyte MAC1. Leukocyte JAM-C can precede and enable interactions between very late antigen 4 (VLA4) and JAM-B, which becomes available during diapedesis. At more basal sections of the junctions, JAM-C may act to seal the junction to avoid reverse egression of leukocytes. b | During transendothelial migration of leukocytes, the junctional complex is temporarily opened. Co-stimulation of endothelial cells leads to a redistribution of JAM-A to the apical surface, which possibly provides directional cues to leukocytes towards the junction. Interacting with the membrane-proximal domain of JAM-A, lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 (LFA1) may intercept JAM-A homophilic interactions at the junctions initiating leukocyte transmigration. Endothelial-cell JAM-A concentrates in a central ring-like structure during transmigration, whereas leukocyte JAM-A may confer signals that are important for de-adhesion and polarity. By coordinated heterophilic and homophilic interactions, JAM-A may provide a molecular zipper that facilitates leukocyte diapedesis.

may interact with leukocyte JAM-A to facilitate opening of the tight junction, and possibly its resealing after diapedesis. Notably, JAM-A that is expressed on transmigrating neutrophils does not undergo redistribution into a central ring-like cluster, as LFA1 does, but is equally present on the leading edge and on the trailing surface of the uropod. This is consistent with a role for leukocyte JAM-A in LFA1 deactivation, which is required to complete transmigration and close the junction. Indeed, leukocyte JAM-A was essential for cell de-adhesion events and was responsible for polarizing cell movement during tissue infiltration in a mouse model⁵⁸. This may be accomplished by intracellular signalling through JAM-A or by interactions with LFA1 in *cis*. Thus, JAM-A is ideally positioned at apical junctions to provide a molecular zipper for the transendothelial migration of leukocytes through a complex interplay of heterophilic and homophilic interactions (FIG. 3b). At later stages of leukocyte transmigration, the process of diapedesis also involves steps mediated by platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 (PECAM1) homophilic interactions and CD99 homophilic interactions⁵⁹.

Interactions of platelets with leukocytes and endothelium. Platelets have been suggested to function as immune cells that actively support inflammatory leukocyte recruitment by various mechanisms⁶⁰. JAM-A was originally characterized as the target of a stimulatory monoclonal antibody that induces platelet aggregation and protein secretion⁶¹. Platelets constitutively express surface JAM-A and specifically bind to monolayers of CHO cells transfected with JAM-A but not to CHO cells transfected with a control vector³⁶. The notion that JAM-A facilitates platelet adhesion to endothelium was supported by findings showing that platelet binding to cytokine-stimulated endothelial cells is partially blocked by soluble JAM-A. Moreover, peptides that contained sequences from the membrane-distal immunoglobulin-fold of JAM-A could block platelet adhesion³⁸, which suggests that homophilic interactions of platelet and endothelial-cell JAM-A contribute to platelet adhesion on activated endothelium. Recent reports have unveiled the importance of JAM-A in transient interactions of activated platelets or their microparticles with the endothelium, which facilitates

the deposition of platelet-derived chemokines in the context of atherosclerosis ${ }^{47,62}$. Given the pleiotropic role of platelets as immune cells ${ }^{60}$, this epitomizes the involvement of JAM-A in the delivery of active platelet products and mediators in vascular inflammation.

JAM-C is also expressed by platelets. Platelet JAM-C interacts with leukocyte MAC1 (and the integrin $\alpha_{x} \beta_{2}$) to facilitate platelet–leukocyte interactions. Together with glycoprotein Iba, JAM-C serves as an important heterotypic ligand for MAC1 that is responsible for platelet–leukocyte adhesion, as adhesion could be inhibited by soluble JAM-C or JAM-C-specific antibody ${ }^{18}$. As MAC1 is the main receptor that mediates firm arrest of leukocytes on adherent platelets ${ }^{63}$, JAM-C seems to be more relevant in direct adhesive interactions with leukocytes than in regulating immune functions of platelets.

### JAMs in inflammation and vascular pathogenesis

The role of JAMs in inflammation and vascular pathogenesis, such as hyperplasia of the neointima, has been studied using different *in vivo* models (TABLE 1). For example, the importance of JAM-A in perivascular neutrophil recruitment has been revealed using a blocking monoclonal antibody in a model of experimental cytokine-induced meningitis ${ }^{45}$ and in an air-pouch model of skin inflammation ${ }^{5}$. By contrast, this was not seen in a model of bacterial meningitis, which might be related to differences in the pathogenic agent ${ }^{46}$. Moreover, the involvement of JAM-A and JAM-C has been shown in a mouse model of acute thioglycollate-induced peritonitis, in which both JAM-A deficiency and JAM-C-specific antibody blockade reduced inflammatory leukocyte recruitment ${ }^{48,58}$. In an elegant study, overexpression of JAM-C under the control of an endothelial-cell-specific promoter led to an increase in alveolar and perivascular

Neointima  
The innermost layer of an artery, which is covered by a monolayer of endothelium, is termed the intima. Atherosclerotic plaques form in the intima. A neointima forms after arterial denudation injury comprising a new layer of endothelial cells on the intimal surface.

initiate angiogenesis (FIG. 4a). JAM-A is also required for bFGF-induced activation of extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK)⁶⁶. Experiments in which JAM-A signalling is blocked have shown that signalling through JAM-A is required for bFGF-induced angiogenesis²⁹, and is also important in αᵥβ₃-integrin-specific endothelial-cell migration on vitronectin⁵⁰. Accordingly, bFGF-induced angiogenesis is almost completely impaired in JAM-A-deficient mice⁶⁵. JAM-A is crucial for correct endothelial-cell motility, directional movement and focal contact formation, and thereby is involved in angiogenesis.

More recently, JAM-C was found to be involved in angiogenesis using two different *in vivo* models⁶⁷. A JAM-C-specific blocking monoclonal antibody reduced angiogenesis in models of hypoxia-induced retinal neovascularization and tumour vascularization⁶⁷. Whether JAM-C functionally interacts with growth-factor receptors or integrins expressed on endothelial cells remains to be examined. Notably, the functional duality of JAMs, with roles in both angiogenesis and inflammation, underscores the increasingly appreciated link between inflammatory-cell recruitment and vessel development, thereby adding a new molecular dimension. Homophilic interactions of JAM-C have also been found to mediate interactions between tumour cells and endothelial cells³⁹, and may thereby enhance or contribute to the process of tumour-cell metastasis⁶⁸.

Role in ischaemia–reperfusion injury. Reperfusion of an acutely ischaemic tissue elicits an intense inflammatory response that causes tissue injury accompanied by leukocyte adhesion to the blood vessel wall and subsequent infiltration into underlying tissues⁶⁹. Ischaemic injury to the liver can occur as a consequence of circulatory shock or hepatic surgery, leading to local or systemic dysfunctions, and is of considerable relevance for intensive-care medicine. During reperfusion, JAM-A expression is upregulated on hepatic venular endothelium³⁴. Consistent with a role for JAM-A, the transendothelial migration of neutrophils was reduced in JAM-A-deficient mice after ischaemia–reperfusion. Similar effects on leukocyte transmigration in mice lacking endothelial-cell JAM-A clearly implicated endothelial-cell JAM-A in this process³⁴. Despite the attenuation of neutrophil extravasation, hepatic injury was more severe in these animals, and was associated with increased hepatocyte apoptosis and was possibly related to vascular leukocyte retention, which may cause increased venule-to-tissue leakage, or to a potential role of neutrophils in post-ischaemic remodelling (FIG. 4b).

Similarly, in JAM-A-deficient mice, the tissue infiltration of neutrophils following cardiac ischaemia–reperfusion injury was reduced and leukocytes were entrapped on, between or beneath endothelial cells of the heart or mesenteric microvasculature⁵⁸. In this model, leukocyte JAM-A was particularly important. Mechanistic clues were provided by *in vitro* studies showing that reduced transmigration of JAM-A-deficient neutrophils correlated with increased adhesion to matrix proteins and impaired polarized motility⁵⁸. It is conceivable that endothelial-cell JAM-A is more important in the liver because of the

minimal expression of JAM-B and JAM-C in this tissue, whereas JAM-B and JAM-C may substitute for JAM-A function in the endothelium of the heart. This highlights the tissue-specific and context-dependent effects (or redundancy) of JAMs.

Role in atherogenesis and vascular lesion formation. The inflammatory recruitment of mononuclear cells has emerged as the crucial force driving the initiation and progression of atherosclerotic lesion formation and is controlled by pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and adhesion molecules⁷⁰,⁷¹. An upregulation of JAM expression on atherosclerotic endothelium and early lesions³⁰,³¹ has suggested a role for JAMs in atherogenesis and vascular lesion formation (FIG. 4c). Increased expression of JAM-A and JAM-C was confirmed both at the protein and transcript level, and can be induced by oxidized lipoproteins (rather than cytokines) and under hyperlipidaemic conditions in apolipoprotein E (*APOE*)-deficient mice that have been fed a high-fat diet. JAM-C on atherosclerotic endothelium can mediate MAC1-dependent adhesion and transmigration of leukocytes³⁰, and a function of JAM-A in early atherogenesis was inferred from the inhibition of mononuclear-cell accumulation by soluble JAM-A³¹. It is conceivable that a simultaneous presence of JAM-A and JAM-C on atherosclerotic endothelium has synergistic effects in promoting atherogenic monocyte recruitment. The role of JAM-A in lesion development has been studied by genetic deletion of *Jama* in atherosclerosis-prone APOE-deficient mice. Neointimal lesion formation and macrophage infiltration after arterial injury was markedly reduced in mice lacking both JAM-A and APOE⁴⁷. Upregulation of JAM-A expression in unstable human plaques concomitant with increased macrophage infiltration further implies its role at later stages of lesion development and progression³². Interestingly, single-nucleotide polymorphisms located in the gene encoding JAM-A have been found to be associated with high levels of triglycerides and hyperlipidaemia, and may thereby contribute to vascular inflammation⁷²,⁷³.

Besides directly contributing to mononuclear-cell recruitment, JAMs expressed by platelets harbour additional mechanisms that operate in atherogenesis. Platelet JAM-C may promote atherothrombosis through the engagement of MAC1 to mediate leukocyte–platelet interactions or to promote the recruitment of such complexes¹⁸. Moreover, JAM-A on the surface of platelets was found to participate in platelet adhesion to the endothelium under inflammatory conditions³⁸. Transient interactions of platelets with early atherosclerotic endothelium can lead to endothelial-cell deposition of platelet chemokines, such as CC-chemokine ligand 5 (CCL5), which besides triggering other platelet-dependent mechanisms, can trigger mononuclear-cell recruitment to aggravate atherosclerosis⁷⁴,⁷⁵. Moreover, microparticles shed from activated platelets mediate CCL5 deposition by transient tethers on activated endothelium involving JAM-A signals⁶². Indeed, CCL5 deposition by JAM-A-deficient platelets on endothelium that is recovering after injury is impaired⁴⁷. Therefore, platelets use engagement of JAM-A during platelet interactions with the vessel wall.

Figure 4 | JAMs in angiogenesis, ischaemia-reperfusion injury, atherogenesis and arterial injury. **a** | Junctional adhesion molecule A (JAM-A) regulates angiogenesis based on interactions with the integrin $\alpha_{v}\beta_{3}$. Stimulation with basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) causes a dissociation of the JAM-A–$\alpha_{v}\beta_{3}$-integrin complex contributing to a partial junctional disorganization and allowing signal transduction (such as mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation) through JAM-A and $\alpha_{v}\beta_{3}$-integrin to initiate endothelial-cell migration and angiogenesis. **b** | Immunostaining for JAM-A in sections of murine heart after ischaemia-reperfusion injury shows upregulation of JAM-A expression (green) on microvascular endothelium (left panel). In vivo mouse models of ischaemia-reperfusion injury in the liver or heart show upregulation of JAM-A expression on microvascular endothelium (middle panel) and reduced leukocyte transmigration in JAM-A-deficient mice (right panel) partially resulting in increased injury due to leukocyte retention on or between microvascular endothelial cells. **c** | JAMs are present on matrix-adherent platelets after wire-induced denudation injury and are upregulated on early atherosclerotic endothelium, providing substrates for leukocyte adhesion and participating in transient interactions with platelets and/or microparticles to mediate deposition of platelet chemokines (such as CC-chemokine ligand 5 (CCL5)) on activated or recovering endothelium. The subsequent mononuclear-cell recruitment is crucial for neointima formation and progression of atherogenesis. The upregulation of JAM expression by oxidized lipoproteins or in hyperlipidaemic mice may be relevant for primary atherogenesis, neointima formation and the development of unstable plaques.

Notably, JAM-A has also been identified on smooth-muscle cells in atherosclerotic arteries but its contribution remains unclear<sup>31</sup>.

# Therapeutic implications

Given the important functions of JAMs in vascular inflammation, targeting of JAMs may have significant therapeutic implications. Beyond blocking monoclonal antibodies, soluble forms of JAM proteins could be applied to inhibit specific interactions of JAMs. Blocking of leukocyte LFA1 or JAM-A with soluble JAM-A may impede interactions in JAM-A-containing endothelial-cell ring-like structures<sup>31,49</sup> to limit inflammatory leukocyte extravasation. Using soluble forms of JAM-A with single domain deletions may enable selective interference of heterophilic but not homophilic interactions of JAM-A to avoid deleterious effects of potential therapeutic applications on endothelial-cell integrity. The identification of the relevant motifs may instigate the development of small-molecule antagonists that specifically target interactions between JAM-A and LFA1. Differential effects of blocking JAMs, such as an aggravation of hepatic reperfusion injury versus an inhibition of arterial neointima formation<sup>34,47</sup>, should be taken into account and possibly translated into regional or tissue-specific applications of antagonistic strategies. Similarly, soluble JAM-C has been used to inhibit MAC1-dependent neutrophil arrest and transmigration in surrogate models of vascular injury and inflammatory recruitment<sup>17,18</sup>. The redundancy in the JAM system, as illustrated by the inconspicuous phenotypes upon genetic manipulation of the family members, may allow for the use of such strategies without compromising other important immune functions.

## Conclusions and future directions

There is compelling evidence for a role of JAMs as gatekeepers at the junctional complex. Together with the adhesive interactions mediated by JAMs on leukocytes and platelets, this provides new insights into the functional relevance of JAMs in inflammation and vascular pathogenesis. It will be important to dissect how the interplay between different JAMs, together with other junctional proteins and integrins, coordinates leukocyte diapedesis and the re-assembly of the junctions after transmigration. The crosstalk between JAMs may help to determine the specificity for leukocyte subtypes. Defining the role of JAMs will help to elaborate all steps in the molecular cascade of leukocyte extravasation. Future research directed at subtype-specific interaction patterns of JAMs in suitable *in vitro* or *in vivo* models will be crucial for the therapeutic targeting of distinct JAM functions. The identification of selective targets and the design of antagonists harbour considerable potential for the treatment of inflammatory and cardiovascular diseases.

The upregulation of JAM expression under inflammatory conditions and in unstable plaques, which shows a possible role for JAMs in plaque rupture and thrombosis, emphasizes the role of JAMs in vascular disease. Indeed, the shedding of JAMs from the cell surface may occur in vascular disease and serve as a marker of disease activity. Studies using transgenic mice with cell-specific overexpression or deletion of JAMs and relevant *in vivo* models are warranted to explore their functions in different vascular and circulating cell types, which may affect both inflammatory leukocyte recruitment and vascular disease.
