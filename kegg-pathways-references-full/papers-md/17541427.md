# Mdm38 protein depletion causes loss of mitochondrial K⁺/H⁺ exchange activity, osmotic swelling and mitophagy

K Nowikovsky¹, S Reipert², RJ Devenish³ and RJ Schwenen*,¹

Loss of the *MDM38* gene product in yeast mitochondria results in a variety of phenotypic effects including reduced content of respiratory chain complexes, altered mitochondrial morphology and loss of mitochondrial K⁺/H⁺ exchange activity resulting in osmotic swelling. By use of doxycycline-regulated shut-off of *MDM38* gene expression, we show here that loss of K⁺/H⁺ exchange activity and mitochondrial swelling are early events, associated with a reduction in membrane potential and fragmentation of the mitochondrial reticulum. Changes in the pattern of mitochondrially encoded proteins are likely to be secondary to the loss of K⁺/H⁺ exchange activity. The use of a novel fluorescent biosensor directed to the mitochondrial matrix revealed that the loss of K⁺/H⁺ exchange activity was immediately followed by morphological changes of mitochondria and vacuoles, the close association of these organelles and finally uptake of mitochondrial material by vacuoles. Nigericin, a K⁺/H⁺ ionophore, fully prevented these effects of Mdm38p depletion. We conclude that osmotic swelling of mitochondria triggers selective mitochondrial autophagy or mitophagy.

Mitochondria are dynamic organelles in morphology and turnover. They form a branched, tubular network located below the cell cortex in budding yeast. In growing cells this network is a highly motile structure. Equilibrium between fission and fusion of tubular branches is essential for cellular adaptation to varying physiological conditions and to ensure inheritance of mitochondria by daughter cells.¹,² These processes involve a series of proteins that have to deal with joining or separating both the outer and inner mitochondrial membranes in a coordinated fashion. Maintenance and inheritance of mitochondria also involve active movement along cytoskeletal elements.³ Mutants with defects in the fusion process contain numerous spherical fragmented mitochondria. In contrast, fission defects result in net-like agglomerations of mitochondria.¹ There is growing support for the role of ion homeostasis in determining mitochondrial morphology. Recent work points to a crucial role of mitochondrial Ca²⁺ homeostasis in shaping mitochondria. Changes of intramitochondrial Ca²⁺ concentration and in Ca²⁺ signaling between ER and mitochondria trigger mitochondrial fragmentation at an early stage of cell death.⁴

Systematic analysis of a yeast deletion mutant collection has led to the identification of a large series of genes as being directly or indirectly involved in shaping mitochondrial morphology.⁵ One of those genes, *MDM38/YOL027c*, also showed up in a screen for genes involved in mitochondrial cation homeostasis. Its product is an integral protein of the inner mitochondrial membrane, and is well conserved among all eukaryotes.⁶ Hemizygous deletion in humans has been invoked as causing a major part of the Wolf-Hirschhorn disease phenotype.⁷ The presence of a putative EF Ca²⁺ binding hand domain within almost all Mdm38p homologues suggested a role for Mdm38p in mitochondrial Ca²⁺ homeostasis and morphology.⁵,⁸ We have recently characterized Mdm38p/Mkh1p as an essential component of the mitochondrial K⁺/H⁺ exchange system. Mutants deleted for this gene have functional defects of mitochondria, reduced growth of cells on non-fermentable substrate (*petite* phenotype), a nearly complete loss of mitochondrial K⁺ (Na⁺)/H⁺ exchange activity, high K⁺ matrix content, low membrane potential (∆ψ), and dramatically increased volume.⁶,⁹ Recently, Frazier et al. (2006) noted reduced amounts of certain mitochondrially encoded proteins in the inner membrane despite their translation efficiency being unchanged. They found that protein A-tagged Mdm38p formed complexes with mitochondrial ribosomes, and suggested that the reduced amount of some of the mitochondrially encoded proteins of complexes III, IV, and V resulted from the lack of Mdm38p interacting with mitochondrial ribosomes to mediate membrane insertion of several proteins of nuclear and mitochondrial origin.¹⁰ These data led Frazier et al. to propose that Mdm38p is acting as a component of the mitochondrial protein export machinery.

Making use of a yeast strain conditionally expressing Mdm38p, we address the following questions. Which is the primary phenotype arising from the deletion of *MDM38*? Is the reduction of mitochondrial-encoded proteins a direct effect of the lack of Mdm38p, or a secondary consequence resulting from the disturbance of mitochondrial $K^{+}$ homeostasis, swelling and/or reduction in $\Delta\psi$? Since we observed mitochondrial fragmentation upon Mdm38p shut-off, and the association of mitochondrial fragments with vacuoles, we asked whether breakdown of the mitochondrial reticulum due to osmotic swelling led to mitochondria-selective autophagy, which has been termed mitophagy. ${}^{11,12}$

**Results**

Disturbance of mitochondrial translation and membrane insertion is not a primary effect of *mdm38Δ*. Yeast strains disrupted for the *MDM38* gene (*mdm38Δ*) exhibit a growth defect on non-fermentable substrate (petite phenotype) and altered mitochondrial morphology, ${}^{5}$ reduced amounts of certain mitochondrially encoded proteins, reduced $\Delta\psi$, ${}^{6,13}$ and a near total loss of mitochondrial $K^{+}/H^{+}$ exchange activity associated with increased $K^{+}$ content and osmotic swelling. ${}^{6,9}$ Figure 1 presents the pattern of mitochondrially translated proteins obtained by incubation of wild type and *mdm38Δ* cells with labeled methionine in the presence of cycloheximide. Consistent with previous observations, ${}^{13}$ we observe a reduction in abundance of Cox2, Cob, and Cox3, but no apparent changes in ATP synthase proteins. Cytochrome spectra also revealed reductions in the bc1 and a.a3 spectral bands (data not shown). Similar results were obtained when we compared the levels of mitochondrial membrane proteins as detected by BN gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting (Supplementary Figure S1). Addition of nigericin, a $K^{+}/H^{+}$ ionophore, to *mdm38Δ* cells efficiently restored both growth of these cells on non-fermentable substrate (Figure 2) and the pattern of mitochondrially synthesized proteins (Figure 1). These results are difficult to reconcile with the suggestion that the primary role of Mdm38p is in the insertion of proteins from the mitochondrial matrix into the inner membrane. ${}^{13}$ Rather, they support our proposal that a lack of $K^{+}/H^{+}$ activity causes the *mdm38Δ* growth defect ${}^{6}$ and that effects on the pattern of mitochondrially synthesized proteins are a result thereof.

To differentiate further between primary and secondary phenotypic effects of the *mdm38Δ* mutation, we ectopically expressed the *MDM38* gene under the control of a doxycycline (dox) regulated promoter in an *mdm38Δ* deletion strain (designated *MDM38*${}^{dox}$). As shown in Figure 3 (upper panel), the amount of Mdm38p decreased below the level of detection within 25 h ($t_{25}$) following downregulation of its expression. The pattern of mitochondrially synthesized proteins observed with pulse labeling assays, however, remained essentially unchanged up to 50 h following downregulation (Figure 3, lower panel). Equally, steady-state levels of mitochondrially encoded Cox subunits remained constant for up to 50 h following *MDM38* downregulation (Supplementary Figure S2). In addition, cytochrome bc1 and a.a3 spectral bands were comparable to those of wild-type cells up to 50 h following Mdm38p downregulation (not shown).

**Primary effects of *mdm38Δ* mutation on mitochondrial $K^{+}/H^{+}$ exchange activity.** Having established that reduction in the amount of mitochondrial proteins is not an immediate effect of the *MDM38* gene deletion, we sought to determine its primary effect. For this purpose, we carried out further series of time-course experiments, making use of the *MDM38*${}^{dox}$ strain.

Hypoosmotic potassium acetate (KOAc) treatment of wild-type mitochondria results in rapid swelling, which reflects

As described in our previous studies,<sup>6</sup> mutant mdm38Δ mitochondria exhibit severely reduced KOAc-induced swelling in contrast to wild-type mitochondria. Mitochondria isolated from MDM38<sup>dox</sup> cells initially (up to *t*<sub>16</sub> of Mdm38p depletion) displayed a high swelling amplitude (Figure 4a). At later times, following dox-mediated shut-off of Mdm38p expression the swelling amplitude reached first intermediate levels (*t*<sub>20</sub>), then became marginal (*t*<sub>25</sub> to *t*<sub>50</sub>). This correlates with the level of Mdm38 protein at these time points (Figure 4b). Mitochondria of wild-type cells treated similarly with dox for a time period up to *t*<sub>50</sub> did not show any significant change of their swelling amplitude (data not shown). These results are consistent with a primary role of Mdm38p in K<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchange.

As a further parameter, we determined the mitochondrial ΔΨ from the same preparations used for swelling and immunoblotting experiments (Figure 4a and b, respectively). Mdm38p depletion resulted in a decrease of ΔΨ starting at *t*<sub>25</sub> (Figure 4c) while dox treatment of wild-type cells did not show any reduction in ΔΨ.

electron density of the vacuolar membrane was strongly increased and exhibited concave indentations all over (Figure 5b, middle panel and Figure 5c, middle panel). These vacuolar membrane formations have previously been described to occur in mitophagy. ${}^{11,15,16}$ In fact, at $t_{25}$ of Mdm38p depletion vacuoles appeared to protrude towards

mitochondria and the electron density of both interacting organelles was strongly reduced (Figure 5b, left panel). Ongoing proteolysis could be a possible explanation for this phenomenon. Mitochondrial particles exhibiting low electron density were eventually engulfed by the vacuoles together with or without surrounding cytoplasm (Figure 5b, right

is the primary cause for morphological changes of mitochondria, which in turn trigger the process of mitophagy.

Confocal microscopy of cells undergoing mitophagy induced by Mdm38p depletion. Figure 6 depicts mitochondrial structures observed by confocal microscopy in wild-type cells (Figures 6a–c) and in *mdm38Δ* mutant cells (Figures 6d–f) expressing GFP targeted to the mitochondrial matrix. In mutant cells (d–f) a large number of individual, spherical units were present instead of the highly branched mitochondrial network of wild-type cells (a–c). Similar structures were seen when GFP was directed to the outer mitochondrial membrane (data not shown). Accordingly, the distinct spherical units in *mdm38Δ* cells did not result from cristae constriction, but from a full breakdown of the mitochondrial network.

During Mdm38p depletion from *MDM38*<sup>dox</sup> cells we observed that mitochondrial tubules initially became shorter and the regular distribution of elongated tubular networks throughout the cell cortex changed into crown-like networks of thick, but short branches surrounding the vacuole and were eventually fragmented into distinct spherical organelles (not shown). Table 1 indicates the percentage of cells exhibiting fragmented mitochondria observed over the period of Mdm38p downregulation in comparison to a strain constitutively expressing Mdm38p.

Simultaneous counterstaining of the vacuole membrane with the dye FM4-64 illustrated vacuolar membranes with indentations and pointed to some green and red overlaps after Mdm38p depletion, consistent with ongoing mitophagy. Parallel cultures of *MDM38*<sup>dox</sup> cells, grown in the presence of dox and nigericin, did not show any indications of close proximity of vacuoles and mitochondria (not shown).

To monitor further the fate of mitochondria upon Mdm38p depletion, we made use of a biosensor targeted specifically to mitochondria by means of the citrate synthase targeting sequence. This biosensor consists of two fluorescent proteins, a pH-sensitive variant of GFP and a pH-insensitive variant of the RFP, DsRed. In the acidic environment of the vacuole (pH ~5.5), the pH-sensitive GFP loses its fluorescence, whereas the red fluorescence expressed from the same construct is retained. Thus, this biosensor reports mitochondrial uptake by accumulation of red fluorescence within yeast vacuoles. For wild-type cells grown under non-starvation conditions few cells show mitochondrial uptake; however, under starvation conditions mitochondrial uptake is dramatically enhanced (C Rosado, D Mijaljica, M Prescott and RJ Devenish, unpublished observations).

We co-transformed *MDM38*<sup>dox</sup> with the biosensor construct pCS-G/RFP (this strain was denoted *MDM38*<sup>dox</sup>-G/RFP) and monitored the changes in green and red fluorescence using confocal microscopy (Figure 7B). Time-dependent depletion of Mdm38p was revealed in parallel by Western blotting (Figure 7A). The cells were grown to the early logarithmic stage for periods of 4, 10, 20, 25, 29, or 50 h in presence of dox, or dox and nigericin as indicated. Green fluorescence clearly documents the normal branched reticular network of mitochondria of wild-type cells. Red fluorescence colocalizes with green fluorescence as expected in wild-type cells, and there is little evidence for mitochondrial uptake into the

Wild-type cells expressing the tetO promoter from the empty plasmid pCM189 (WT) and $MDM38^{dox}$ cells, both carrying pYX232-mtGFP and maintained in logarithmic growth phase in the presence of 5 $\mu$l/ml doxycycline for the indicated time, were analyzed using conventional fluorescent microscopy. In each experiment the percentage of cells containing fragmented mitochondria from $10^3$ $MDM38^{dox}$ and WT cells was determined. The experiments were repeated separately at least three times. Data calculated from at least three independent experiments are presented as mean ± S.E.M.

vacuole since no red fluorescence is seen there (Figure 7B, panel a). Growth of wild-type cells in presence of dox for 50 h had no effect on the mitochondrial structure as can be seen in Figure 7B, panel b. In contrast, at early time points of growth of $MDM38^{dox}$-G/RFP cells in the presence of dox, the gradual alteration in mitochondrial morphology, from elongated to rounded forms, became evident. Similar to wild-type cells (Figure 7B, panel a), red fluorescence was first fully colocalized with green fluorescence as shown in the overlay image (Figure 7B, panels c–e). However, at a later time point ($t_{25}$), correlating to the loss of mitochondrial K⁺/H⁺ exchange activity and ongoing swelling, mitochondrial fragmentation became apparent and some fragmented organelles were found lacking green fluorescence but retaining red fluorescence (Figure 7B, panel f). Thereafter ($t_{29}$ and $t_{50}$) significant accumulation of red fluorescence in vacuoles was detected, reflecting turnover of mitochondria in vacuoles (Figure 7B, panels g and i). In line with the EM data presented above, the appearance of some mitochondria showing red fluorescence only and thereafter of red fluorescence in vacuoles suggests that some mitochondria become acidic before being ingested. In a parallel experiment, $MDM38^{dox}$-G/RFP cells were grown for 29 and 50 h in the presence of dox with nigericin also present for the last 4 h. Remarkably, the mitochondria were fragmented to a much lesser extent and more strikingly, these cells did not display any accumulation of red fluorescence in the vacuoles (Figure 7B, panels h and j), suggesting little if any turnover of mitochondria was occurring. These results confirm that in the presence of the K⁺/H⁺ ionophore nigericin mitochondrial tubular networks have been re-established either by fusion of persisting spherical organelles, or from newly formed organelles, or both. Presumably, such

mitochondria are no longer marked for vacuolar degradation even in the absence of Mdm38p.

To learn whether mitophagy induced by dysfunctional mitochondria contributes to cell survival, aliquots of logarithmic growth phase cells taken from each time point of Mdm38p depletion were stained with the vital stain Trypan blue and the percentage of dead cells was evaluated. Both, wild type and $MDM38^{dox}$-G/RFP cells exhibited a cell death rate of 0.5–3% per generation. Thus, induction of mitophagy (clearly observed from $t_{25}$ on) has no significant effect on cell viability. Interestingly, we noticed that Mdm38p depletion had a strong negative effect on survival of cells in stationary growth phase. Cells grown for 50 h in presence of dox were kept in the original galactose-containing growth medium and incubated with shaking at 28°C for a week. Every day samples were taken and stained with Trypan blue. Counting of Trypan blue-positive cells indicated a significant decrease in the survival rate of Mdm38p depleted cells in comparison to wild-type cells (Figure 8).

Fragmentation and autophagic degradation of $mdm38\Delta$ mitochondria require the presence of Dnm1p. As described previously, the dynamin-related GTPase Dnm1p mediates scission of the outer mitochondrial membrane. Mitochondrial membranes in the $dnm1\Delta$ strain have been shown to be collapsed into one or more long tubular structures near the cell cortex and often a planar ‘net’ of interconnected tubules. ${}^{19,20}$ We addressed the question whether fragmentation of $mdm38\Delta$ mitochondria could be restored by changing the balance towards reduced fission or enhanced fusion. We first constructed a $dnm1\Delta mdm38\Delta$ strain expressing the mitochondrial targeted GFP and then examined the mitochondrial network. Confocal microscopy of $dnm1\Delta mdm38\Delta$ cells expressing mitochondrially targeted GFP revealed the presence of giant mitochondrial spheres without any obvious tubulation. The $dnm1\Delta$ mutation thus

prevented the fragmentation of mitochondria into a larger number of spherical units typical of $mdm38\Delta$ single mutant cells. Simultaneous counterstaining of vacuolar membranes with the dye FM4-64 (not shown), or expression of pCS-G/RFP in $dnm1\Delta mdm38\Delta$ cells revealed that $dnm1\Delta$ suppressed $mdm38\Delta$ induced mitophagy (Figure 9a). Transmission electron microscopy of $dnm1\Delta mdm38\Delta$ cells (Figure 9b and c) confirmed the presence of giant mitochondrial spheres. Formation of these giant spheres is assumed to reflect osmotic swelling of mitochondria due to the lack of Mdm38p combined with a fission defect due to the $dnm1\Delta$ mutation. The lack of association between mitochondria and vacuoles in the double mutant suggests that mitophagy is prevented by the fission defect and that fragmentation of mitochondria may be a prerequisite for the degradation process. Interestingly, growth of $dnm1\Delta mdm38\Delta$ cells was much reduced compared to $mdm38\Delta$ cells, both on fermentable and non-fermentable substrates (not shown). Western blotting revealed only traces of Cox2 protein and reduced amounts of ATPase F1$\beta$ subunit in $dnm1\Delta mdm38\Delta$ mitochondria (Supplementary Figure S1A and B). This is consistent with the near total absence of cristae structures.

Finally, we asked if mitochondrial fragmentation and mitophagy could be compensated by enhancing fusion activity. Therefore, we overexpressed Fzo1p or Mgm1p, both proteins mediating mitochondrial fusion, in $mdm38\Delta$ cells. Neither protein could counteract the process of mitochondrial fragmentation and mitophagy or rescue the $mdm38\Delta$ petite phenotype (data not shown), indicating that fragmentation of $mdm38\Delta$ mitochondria is not caused by low activity of proteins that promote mitochondrial fusion.

Discussion

Conditional shutdown of $MDM38$ gene expression has been used here to discriminate between primary and secondary phenotypic effects resulting from the loss of Mdm38p in yeast

While the pattern of mitochondrially synthesized proteins as well as of cytochrome spectra remained unaffected even after prolonged Mdm38p depletion, mitochondrial K⁺/H⁺ exchange activity diminished with the loss of Mdm38p. Accordingly, we conclude that this is the predominant and only known phenotype immediately resulting from Mdm38p depletion. Strong support for this conclusion comes from our observation that nigericin, a K⁺/H⁺ ionophore, restores growth of Mdm38p depleted cells on non-fermentable media. Loss of mitochondrially synthesized proteins,¹³ therefore, is not a primary phenotypic feature of Mdm38 depletion.

Loss of K⁺/H⁺ exchange activity in *mdm38Δ* cells resulted in mitochondrial K⁺ overload and osmotic swelling.⁶,⁹ As shown here by EM and confocal microscopy, these events were paralleled by the conversion of the tubular mitochondrial network into many distinct spheres and their association with the yeast vacuole. Moreover, the vacuolar membrane was found to be considerably thickened and to exhibit indentations all over. This pathway has features similar to those recently described, where the vacuolar membrane exhibited concave indentations associated with microautophagy of mitochondria.¹¹,¹⁶ It is unclear at present how selective this microautophagy might be. However, recent studies implicate mitochondrial membrane depolarization and swelling of the matrix compartment in the onset of selective macroautophagic degradation processes.²¹,²²

Here, we made use of electron microscopy and a novel biosensor composed of a pH-sensitive GFP and a pH-insensitive RFP, targeted to mitochondria. Upon Mdm38p depletion in logarithmically growing cells, we found red fluorescence associated with vacuoles indicative of the uptake of mitochondria into vacuoles. Addition of nigericin, a K⁺/H⁺ ionophore, to growing *mdm38Δ* cells depleted for Mdm38p essentially reverted the appearance of mitochondria as well as of vacuoles within a few hours. There were no longer any indications of ongoing mitophagy. Thus, autophagic degradation of mitochondria in Mdm38p-depleted cells clearly correlates with the loss of K⁺/H⁺ exchange activity.

For the first time our data show that a mutation-induced dysfunction of mitochondria, without any externally added drugs or physiological stresses, can trigger extensive mitophagy. In previous experiments, the onset of mitophagy had been attributed to the impairing of the mitochondrial electrochemical transmembrane potential.¹¹ Mdm38p-depleted cells showed a reduction in Δψ, but two observations suggested that this was not sufficient to trigger fragmentation of the mitochondrial network and mitophagy. First, growth of *mdm38Δ* cells in the presence of oligomycin restored Δψ, but not the tubular reticulum of mitochondria (not shown). Second, mutants lacking Cox4 (*cox4Δ*) or having very low amounts of Cox2 only (*dnmΔmdm38Δ*, Supplementary Figure S1), show a similar reduction in Δψ as *mdm38Δ* cells and show no signs of mitophagy (data not shown). Accordingly, we conclude that osmotic swelling of Mdm38p-depleted cells is sufficient to massively induce mitophagy, provided that fragmentation of the mitochondrial reticulum is not inhibited. Induction of mitophagy by Mdm38p depletion had no significant effect on cell viability under logarithmic growth conditions. Ultrastructure analysis of cells by electron

microscopy revealed enhanced abundance of spherical mitochondria after prolonged (*t₅₀*) depletion of Mdm38p. Presumably, in logarithmic growth, ongoing mitochondrial proliferation counterbalances degradation. In stationary phase, however, Mdm38p depleted cells had a significantly reduced survival rate as compared to wild-type cells, suggesting a synthetic effect of mitophagy and stationary phase induced autophagy. Thus, Mdm38p is required for enhanced survival of cells in stationary phase, and mitophagy in stationary phase is likely involved in a cell death program. Overexpression of proteins of the fusion machinery (Mgm1p, Fzo1p), had no significant effect on *mdm38Δ* mitochondrial morphology, or mitophagy. By contrast, deletion of *DNM1*, a gene with a central role in mitochondrial fission,²³ generated a mitochondrial phenotype combining the features of the *dnm1Δ* mutant and the *mdm38Δ* mutant. These *mdm38Δdnm1Δ* double mutant cells contained one or few individual giant mitochondrial spheres which we interpret as resulting from osmotic swelling of mitochondria which continue to fuse but lack fission activity. Interestingly, a block of fission by the *dnm1Δ* mutation prevented mitochondrial fragmentation and also mitophagy. Thus, it appears that induction of mitophagy in *mdm38Δ* cells requires the mitochondrial reticulum to be capable of undergoing fission. Our experimental data provide the first evidence in support of the idea that formation of discrete mitochondrial units allows the cell to rid itself of damaged parts of the mitochondrial network rather than the whole network.¹² Support for this idea is also provided by the studies of Lemasters,²² concerning selective mitophagy in hepatocytes, where mitochondria are generally found as discrete spheres rather than as a reticulum.

### Materials and Methods

#### Yeast strains, plasmids and media.
The *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* strain W303 (ATCC no. 201239) served as wild-type strain. The null mutant *mdm38Δ* was constructed from W303 by replacement of *MDM38* with *HIS3* as described previously in Nowikovsky et al.⁶ To generate the *mdm38Δdnm1Δ* double deletion strain, *mdm38Δ* was crossed with the deletion strain *dnm1Δ* obtained from sporulation of W303 *mgm1Δdnm1Δ* generously provided by Sesaki et al.²⁴

Culturing of yeast was performed according to standard protocols at 30°C on yeast media, including YPD (2% glucose), YPG 2% (glycerol), YPGal (2% galactose), YPRaf (2% raffinose), SRaf (2%Raf) and SGal (2% galactose), prepared as described previously,²⁵ except for SGal liquid medium which was supplemented with 2 mM adenine. Yeast transformations were performed as described previously.²⁶ For all experiments except the one shown in Figure 2, all strains (but not the *cox2/3Δ* mutants) were grown in galactose containing-media, since galactose is a fermentative carbon source that does not repress mitochondria like glucose. Dox was used when indicated at a concentration of 5 μg/ml. All experiments described in this study were carried out with cultures of cells kept in the logarithmic phase of growth unless otherwise stated. Exponential cultures were diluted as appropriate if grown over periods longer than overnight.

Mitochondrial DNA mutants PTY *cox2Δ*, PTY *cox3Δ* (G. Wiesenberger) fail to express the Cox2, or Cox3 protein, respectively and were grown on YPRaf. To express *MDM38* under a regulated promoter, we constructed an *mdm38Δ* strain expressing Mdm38p from a dox repressible (*tetO*) promoter. For this purpose, *MDM38* was amplified from YCp-*MDM38-HA*⁶ with the primers 5′-TAATATGGATCCATGTTCGCATCAAGAGCG-3′ and 5′-ATATATGGCCCTAGCGGCCTCAGCACTGAGCAGCGTAAATCTGG-3′ and the BamH1-*Sfi1* fragment was inserted into the respective sites of the vector pCM189,²⁷ yielding pCM189-*MDM38-HA*.

The biosensor construct pCS-G/RFP used to follow mitochondrial uptake into vacuoles was constructed by sequential addition of three DNA sequence cassettes into the yeast multi-copy expression vector pAS1NB,²⁸ having *PGK1* transcription

control sequences and LEU2 selectable marker. The sequence cassettes encoded the following components: (1) the RFP component retrieved by PCR from pQE31-DsRed.T3;²⁹ (2) the GFP component retrieved by PCR from pGEX-2 T carrying the ecliptic pHluorin;³⁰ and (3) the first 55 amino acids of the yeast citrate synthase precursor polypeptide amplified by PCR from yeast genomic DNA.³¹

Visualization of mitochondria with mitochondrial matrix targeted GFP expressed from the constitutive TPI (triosephosphate isomerase) promoter was achieved by use of the plasmid pYX232-mtGFP.¹⁸

**In vivo labeling of mitochondrial translation products.** In vivo pulse labeling was performed according to Fox et al.³² Briefly, wild-type expressing the empty plasmid pCM189 and MDM38<sup>dox</sup> cells were pre-grown in SGal medium containing dox (5 μg/ml), wild type and mdm38Δ in YPGal. Nigericin (2 μM) was added as indicated. Control mit⁻ strains (cox2Δ, cox3Δ) were grown in YPRaf. Cells taken from precultures were transferred to synthetic medium lacking methionine and incubated for 3 h in presence or absence of dox as indicated. After addition of cycloheximide (150 μg/ml) cells were labeled with <sup>35</sup>S-methionine (8 μl/ml of a 5 mM Ci stock, Amersham) and incubated for 30 min with agitation. Reactions were chased with unlabeled methionine (4 mM) for 10 and 120 min. Whole cell proteins were precipitated with trichloroacetic according to Westermann,³³ separated by 16% SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography.

**Isolation of mitochondria.** Yeast mitochondria from cultures grown exponentially in galactose-containing media were isolated as described in Nowikovsky et al.⁶

**Western blotting.** Yeast cells were grown in SGal in absence or presence of 5 μg/ml dox as indicated. Cultures were re-diluted as required to keep them in logarithmic growth phase. Total cell extracts were analyzed using 12.5% polyacrylamide gels unless indicated otherwise. Proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and analyzed using primary antibodies to HA (1 : 200;³⁴), Hexokinase-1 (1 : 15 000; Biotrend), GFP (1 : 2000; Roche), Mdm38p (1 : 200; provided by P. Rehling) in PBS-T plus 5% dry milk. Proteins were visualized by incubation with the mouse or rabbit secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1 : 10 000; Molecular Probes, or 1 : 15 000; Sigma, respectively) in PBS-T plus 5% dry milk, followed by ECL (Pierce).

**Measurement of K⁺/H⁺ exchange activities.** Light scattering experiments were performed as previously described in Nowikovsky et al.⁶

**Determination of mitochondrial Δψ.** Isolated yeast mitochondria (0.5 mg protein) were incubated in the presence of 0.5 mM ATP, 0.2% succinate and 0.01% pyruvate with 0.5 μM JC-1 (5,5′,6,6′-tetrachloro-1,1′,3,3′-tetraethylbenzimidazolocarbocyanine iodide, Molecular Probes) for 7 min at room temperature in the dark. The intensity changes of the monomeric form (low energy, 540 nm) and of the multimeric form (high energy, 590 nm) were recorded with the Scan mode of the Perkin Elmer LS55 luminescence photometer. Data collection was carried out with FL WinLab4.0. For calibration, aliquots of the same preparation were hyperpolarized with 1 μM nigericin (Sigma) and depolarized with 1 μM carbonylcyanide-p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP, Sigma). A calibration curve was calculated for every single measurement and applied to correlate the Δψ expressed as a percentage of the maximum and the minimum obtained by hyperpolarization and depolarization, respectively.

**Microscopy.** pVT100U-mtGFP, pYX232-mtGFP,¹⁸ pCS-G/RFP (C Rosado, M Prescott, and RJ Devenish, unpublished) or 5 μM rhodamine B hexyl ester (Molecular Probes) served to label mitochondria. Vacuoles were stained with FM4-64 in a final concentration of 10 μM (Molecular Probes). Classification of the morphotype of cells in logarithmic growth phase was performed with hidden identity by standard fluorescence microscopy on Axioplan 2 with a 63 oil immersion objective (Zeiss Plan Apochromat). Confocal images were captured with a Zeiss Axiowert LSM 510 microscope. The excitation wavelength for GFP and FM4-64/dsRed was 488 and 543 nm, respectively. Images were acquired in multitrack Z stack and projected with LSM5 Image Browser.

**Electron microscopy.** Cells were harvested at early logarithmic growth phase (OD<sub>600</sub> = 0.5). For cryofixation, cell pellets were introduced to flat sample holders of an EMPACT high-pressure freezer (LEICA Microsystems, Austria). With the help of a loading station, the flat specimen holders were placed in a sample holder pod and tightly sealed. The samples were frozen at a pressure of about 2000 bar, as described previously for specimens of mammalian tissues.³⁵ Following freezing, the flat specimen holders were separated from the pods under liquid nitrogen and transferred to a LEICA AFS freeze substitution system (LEICA Microsystems, Austria). Freeze-substitution was as described elsewhere.³⁶ In short, samples were substituted in acetone containing 2% OsO₄ for 4 days at –90°C, followed by warming and embedding in epoxy resin (Agar 100). Thin sections were cut with an Ultracut S ultramicrotome (LEICA Microsystems, Austria), mounted on copper grids with Formvar support film, counterstained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and examined at 80 kV in a JEOL JEM-1210 electron microscope. Images were acquired using a digital camera Morada for the wide-angle port of the TEM and analySIS FIVE software (Soft Image System).

**Trypan blue staining.** Cells were collected and stained with Trypan blue (Gibco BRL) for 15 min at room temperature. Unstained cells (alive) and blue cells (dead) were visualized and counted under light microscopy.
