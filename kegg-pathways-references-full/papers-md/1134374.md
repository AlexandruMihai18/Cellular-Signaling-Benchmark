Enzymic reduction of the 5a-11a double bond has been shown to be the final reaction in the biosynthesis of the tetracycline group of antibiotics. The reaction occurs in antibiotic-producing strains of *Streptomyces aureofaciens* as well as in various blocked mutants derived therefrom. Of the various 5a(11a)-dehydrotetracyclines which have been prepared, only 7-chloro-5a(11a)-dehydrotetracycline is chemically stable; we have therefore chosen it as the substrate to illustrate the reaction described here.

### Assay Method

#### Principle
The presence of 5a(11a) dehydrogenase activity can be determined by measuring an increase in antibacterial activity due to the synthesis of 7-chlorotetracycline from its inactive precursor, 7-chloro-5a(11a)-dehydrotetracycline. Any tetracycline-sensitive bacteria can be used, and either a turbidimetric or agar-diffusion type assay is suitable.

### Reagents

- Tris·HCl buffer, 0.2 M, pH 7.0
- NADPH, 2 mM in water
- 7-Chloro-5a(11a)-dehydrotetracycline, 1 mM in methanol

[47] NADP:TETRACYCLINE 5a(11a)DEHYDROGENASE 607

**Procedure.** A reaction mixture is prepared by combining 0.1 ml of the substrate, 0.1 ml of NADPH, 0.3 ml of water, and 0.5 ml of a 20 mg/ml solution of lyophilized cell-free extract in Tris buffer. The reaction mixture is incubated at $28^\circ$ for 2 hr and assayed for antibiotic activity using a *Staphylococcus aureus* turbidimetric method. The product, 7-chlorotetracycline, can be identified using the following paper chromatographic system: Whatman No. 1 paper buffered with 0.3 $M$ phosphate, pH 3.0, and developed with $n$-butanol saturated with water.

**Preparation of 7-Chloro-5a(11a)-dehydrotetracycline.** This substrate can be prepared by fermentation using a blocked mutant of *S.* *aureofaciens*, ATCC 12748. A vegetative inoculum of this strain is prepared by inoculating spores into a medium containing, in grams per liter: sucrose, 30; ammonium sulfate, 2; calcium carbonate, 7; and corn steep liquor, 16.5 ml. After incubation on a reciprocating shaker for 24 hr at $28^\circ$, the resulting growth is used to inoculate a medium containing, in grams per liter: ammonium sulfate, 5; calcium carbonate, 9; ammonium chloride, 1.5; magnesium chloride·6H₂O, 2; ferrous sulfate·7H₂O, 0.04; magnesium sulfate·4H₂O, 0.05; cobalt chloride·6H₂O, 0.001; zinc sulfate·7H₂O, 0.1; corn steep liquor, 25; starch, 55; lard oil, 2; and riboflavin, 0.002. Fermentation is carried out for 120 hr at $25^\circ$ on a rotary shaker operating at 100 rpm. The yields of 7-chloro-5a(11a)-dehydrotetracycline are in the range of 7–10 g/liter. The product can be isolated by partition chromatography on a Celite column. The charge is prepared by acidifying the fermentation broth to pH 1.5 with conc. HCl, filtering, extracting the filtrate with $n$-butanol after saturating the filtrate with NaCl, and finally concentrating the butanol extract to a small volume. The Celite column is developed with a mixture of $n$-butanol/chloroform (80/20) saturated with 0.01 $N$ HCl. Details of the chromatography and crystallization of the product have been described.

**Preparation of Crude Enzyme Extract from S. aureofaciens ATCC 13,192.** The crude extract is prepared the same as for S-adenosylmethionine-dedimethylamino - 4 - amino-anhydrotetracycline - $N$ - methyltransferase.
