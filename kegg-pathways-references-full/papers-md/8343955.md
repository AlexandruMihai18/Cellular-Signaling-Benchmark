## Summary  

The exo genes of Rhizobium meliloti are needed for the synthesis of an acidic exopolysaccharide, succinoglycan. We have assigned biosynthetic roles to the products of the exo genes by characterizing succinoglycan biosynthetic intermediates from exo mutant strains. We propose a model of succinoglycan biosynthesis in which the products of the exoY and exoF genes function in the addition of the first sugar, galactose, to the lipid carrier; the products of the exoA, exoL, exoM, exoO, exoU, and exoW genes function in subsequent sugar additions; and the product of the exoV gene functions in the addition of pyruvate. The products of the exoP, exoQ, and exoT genes are required for polymerization of the octasaccharide subunits or transport of the completed polymer.

## Introduction  

A complex polysaccharide is needed for the formation of the symbiotic relationship between Rhizobium meliloti and alfalfa (Medicago sativa). R. meliloti fixes nitrogen inside specialized root structures called nodules. The bacteria induce these nodules through the action of a lipooligosaccharide signal molecule called the nod factor, invade the nodules through tubes called infection threads, and are enclosed in a plant-derived membrane as they enter the plant cells in a process similar to endocytosis. Once inside the plant cells, they differentiate into a morphologically distinct form called bacteroids and begin to fix nitrogen (for reviews see Fisher and Long, 1992; Long, 1989; Rolfe and Gresshoff, 1988). Earlier work in our laboratory has shown that an acidic exopolysaccharide, succinoglycan or EPS I, is needed for nodule invasion by R. meliloti strain 1021. Mutants that do not produce this polysaccharide do induce nodules on alfalfa, but these nodules are small and do not contain bacteria (Finan et al., 1985; Keller et al., 1988; Leigh et al., 1985; Long et al., 1988; Müller et al., 1988). This polysaccharide is a polymer of octasaccharide subunits composed of one galactose and seven glucose residues, with acetyl, succinyl, and pyruvyl modifications (Aman et al., 1981) (see Figure 1). Succinoglycan is also synthesized by other bacteria, including Alcaligenes faecalis and several species of Agrobacterium (Harada et al., 1979; Hisamatsu et al., 1980), but the purpose it serves in these bacteria is not known.

Bacteria producing succinoglycan exhibit a blue-green fluorescence under ultraviolet light on medium containing the dye Calcofluor white (Finan et al., 1985). Mutants that do not produce succinoglycan can be isolated readily on the basis of their lack of fluorescence on Calcofluor medium. By this method a cluster of exo genes (Keller et al., 1988; Leigh et al., 1985; Long et al., 1988; Müller et al., 1988) on the second of two symbiotic megaplasmids present in R. meliloti (Finan et al., 1986; Hynes et al., 1986) has been shown to be required for synthesis of succinoglycan. Mutations in exoA, exoB, exoF, exoL, exoM, exoP, exoQ, exoT, and exoY completely abolish succinoglycan production (Keller et al., 1988; Long et al., 1988; Müller et al., 1988; Reuber et al., 1991; Zhan and Leigh, 1990), mutations in exoH cause production of succinoglycan that lacks the succinyl modification (Leigh et al., 1987), and mutations in exoZ (Buendia et al., 1991) cause production of succinoglycan that lacks the acetyl modification (Reuber and Walker, 1993). Recently, four novel exo genes have been discovered in this cluster: exoO, exoU, exoV, and exoW. The isolation and characterization of strains carrying mutations in these genes will be described elsewhere (M. A. Glucksmann, T. L. R., and G. C. W., submitted). All of the exo genes have recently been sequenced (Becker et al., 1993; Buendia et al., 1991; Keller et al., 1988; Reed et al., 1991b; M. A. Glucksmann, T. L. R., and G. C. W., submitted).

Recent work has shown that a low molecular weight form of this polysaccharide can partially suppress the symbiotic deficiencies of exo mutants and may act as a signal to the plant (Battisti et al., 1992; Urzainqui and Walker, 1992). The active oligosaccharide is a tetramer of the octasaccharide repeat unit of succinoglycan (Battisti et al., 1992). It should be noted that strains carrying mutations in exoH, which form nodules on alfalfa that do not fix nitrogen, fail to produce the low molecular weight form of the polysaccharide (Leigh and Lee, 1988), indicating that the succinyl substituent may affect the molecular weight distribution of the polysaccharide.

We decided to investigate the biosynthesis of succinoglycan and the roles of the exo gene products in this process because of the biological importance of succinoglycan, the advantages of its known structure, the well-defined cluster of genes needed for its synthesis, and sequence information for these genes. Succinoglycan, like many complex bacterial polysaccharides, is synthesized on poly-prenyl lipid carriers present in the cytoplasmic membrane of the cell (Sutherland, 1985; Tolmasky et al., 1982; Tolmasky et al., 1980). The octasaccharide subunits of succinoglycan are built up on these carriers, beginning with the single galactose, and then polymerized. We have isolated and characterized these lipid-linked succinoglycan biosynthetic intermediates from exo mutant cells to determine where each mutation blocks the biosynthetic pathway. By this method, we have assigned biosynthetic roles to the products of 12 exo genes.

Results

Construction of Strains to Optimize Labeling of Succinoglycan Intermediates

In initial experiments, incorporation of radioactivity from UDP-$[^{14} \mathrm{C}]$glucose into lipid-linked succinoglycan intermediates by permeabilized wild-type cells was very low, and incorporation was almost undetectable in exo mutant cells. In an effort to increase the efficiency of labeling of intermediates, we found that incorporation of radioactivity was much higher in permeabilized cells of strains carrying the exoB or exoR mutations (Table 1). The exoB gene has been shown to encode UDP-glucose-4-epimerase, which converts UDP-glucose to UDP-galactose, the precursor to the galactose in succinoglycan (Buendia et al., 1991; Canter-Cremers et al., 1990). Since galactose is the first sugar added to the lipid carrier (Tolmasky et al., 1982; Tolmasky et al., 1980), no succinoglycan intermediates can be initiated in exoB cells. When UDP-galactose was provided in the reaction mixture, incorporation of radioactivity from UDP-$[^{14} \mathrm{C}]$glucose into lipid-linked intermediates in permeabilized exoB cells was approximately an order of magnitude higher than in wild-type cells. This effect is probably due to lack of competition for lipid carriers by unlabeled succinoglycan intermediates. As an added benefit, in strains carrying the exoB mutation lipid-linked intermediates could be labeled with UDP-$[^{14} \mathrm{C}]$galactose instead of UDP-$[^{14} \mathrm{C}]$glucose without competition from intracellular UDP-galactose.

exoR encodes a negative regulator of exo gene transcription, so exoR mutants express exo genes at higher levels (Doherty et al., 1988; Reed et al., 1991a; Reuber et al., 1991). In permeabilized exoR cells, incorporation of radioactivity from UDP-$[^{14} \mathrm{C}]$glucose into lipid-linked intermediates was also approximately an order of magnitude higher than in wild-type cells. We had previously shown that the exoR mutation is lethal in combination with most exo mutations that block succinoglycan biosynthesis and have hypothesized that buildup of lipid-linked intermediates could be toxic to the cell (Reuber et al., 1991). It follows from this hypothesis that exoR derivatives of these

exo strains could be constructed if the strains also contained another mutation that blocked production of these intermediates, such as exoB. This proved to be the case. Furthermore, the effects of the exoB and exoR mutations on incorporation of labeled glucose into lipid-linked intermediates were multiplicative; permeabilized exoB exoR cells incorporated almost 100 times more radioactivity than wild-type cells, and exoB exoR strains carrying various other exo mutations showed similar or greater increases relative to the strains carrying the corresponding exo mutations alone. Therefore, all subsequent experiments examining the effects of exo mutations on the composition of lipid-linked intermediates were carried out in an exoB exoR strain background. For convenience, intermediates from an exoB exoR strain carrying no other exo mutation will be referred to as wild-type intermediates.

Characterization of Lipid-Linked Intermediates

Permeabilized cells were labeled with UDP-$[^{14} \mathrm{C}]$galactose, as described in Experimental Procedures. Lipid-linked succinoglycan intermediates were extracted in chloroform-methanol-water (1:2:0.3), and the labeled oligosaccharides were hydrolyzed from the lipid carrier with 0.01 M trifluoroacetic acid and dephosphorylated with alkaline phosphatase. These oligosaccharides were characterized by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) on silica gel 60 (Figure 2) and by gel filtration chromatography on Bio-Gel P-4 (Figure 3). In most cases, oligosaccharides were also further characterized by deesterification with KOH (Figure 4) to remove the acetate and succinate substituents. Results from these experiments for each mutant are presented separately below.

Wild-Type Intermediates

Radiolabeled oligosaccharides released from the lipid fraction obtained from exoB exoR cells resolved into several components by TLC, the largest of which had a mobility slightly lower than that of maltotetraose. A compound with the mobility of galactose and one with the mobility of maltobiose were also seen, as well as several poorly resolved compounds of intermediate mobility (Figure 2, lane 1). Figure 3a shows the profile obtained from gel filtration.

tion chromatography of these oligosaccharides on Bio-Gel P-4. The major peak in the profile (peak I, K = 0.43) is actually a complex of several peaks, probably representing the octasaccharide subunit of succinoglycan with various combinations of the succinyl, acetyl, and pyruvyl substituents (Tolmasky et al., 1982). Octasaccharide produced from succinoglycan with the succinoglycan depolymerase from Cytophaga arvensicola (Amemura et al., 1974) chromatographed in the position of the left side of the major peak (K = 0.41; see Figure 3b). There is also a minor component of much higher mobility (peak II, K = 0.18). This component may represent a small amount of an oligosaccharide consisting of two octasaccharide subunits. The results we have obtained by gel filtration chromatography and TLC are similar to those obtained previously for succinoglycan intermediates from R. meliloti (Tolmasky et al., 1982) and Agrobacterium tumefaciens (Staneloni et al., 1984).

To investigate the presence of noncarbohydrate substituents on these oligosaccharides, we deesterified them with 0.1 M KOH. This treatment should remove the acetyl and succinyl esters of succinoglycan but not the pyruvate ketal. Figure 4m shows that base-treated intermediates

from an exoB exoR strain were resolved into two major components on Bio-Gel P-4 (K = 0.46 and K = 0.51) that exhibited lower mobilities than the untreated intermediates. The mobility of the peak II component was also lower than in the untreated intermediates (K = 0.21), which is consistent with the hypothesis that it may represent two octasaccharide subunits. The K = 0.46 and K = 0.51 components may represent pyruvylated and unpyruvylated octasaccharide. The mobility of the first component (K = 0.46) was similar to that of the octasaccharide subunit of the polysaccharide produced by an exoZ exoH double mutant strain (K = 0.48, data not shown). Because the exoZ mutation blocks the addition of the acetyl substituent and the exoH mutation blocks the addition of the succinyl substituent, the octasaccharide obtained from this strain lacks both esters. The mobility of the second component (K = 0.51) was similar to that of the octasaccharide from the exoZ exoH strain treated with 50 mM oxalic acid to remove the pyruvate ketal (K = 0.53; Figure 4k). However, the mobilities of the treated octasaccharide intermediates were consistently slightly higher than those of the octasaccharide standards. This may indicate that one of the ester substituents is not removed by the KOH treatment. We

have found that the succinyl substituent is more difficult to remove than the acetyl substituent (T. L. R., unpublished data).

**exoY and exoF**

As shown in Figure 2 (lanes 2 and 3), no radioactivity was incorporated into lipid-linked intermediates in exoB exoR derivatives of exoY and exoF strains. Therefore, the exoY and exoF gene products are required for the first step of succinoglycan biosynthesis, the transfer of galactose onto the lipid carrier. Interestingly, the amino acid sequence of ExoY shows significant similarity to that of the GumD protein of Xanthomonas campestris (Becker et al., 1993; Reed et al., 1991b), which is thought to be the glucosyl transferase that catalyzes the addition of glucose to the lipid carrier in xanthan gum biosynthesis (Reed et al., 1991b), and to that of RfbP of Salmonella typhimurium (Becker et al., 1993), which is thought to be the galactose transferase that catalyzes the addition of galactose to the lipid carrier in O-antigen biosynthesis (Jiang et al., 1991). Therefore, it seems likely that ExoY is the galactose transferase in R. meliloti. However, ExoF is apparently also needed for addition of galactose to the lipid carrier.

**exoA**

Permeabilized exoA exoB exoR cells incorporated radioactivity into chloroform–methanol–water-soluble material from UDP-[14C]galactose but not from UDP-[14C]glucose (data not shown). The [14C]galactose-labeled material that was released from the lipid carrier migrated as a single species on TLC, with the mobility of galactose (Figure 2, lane 4). Therefore, the simplest model is that ExoA is the transferase that is required for the second step in succinoglycan biosynthesis, addition of the first glucose to lipid-linked galactose.

**exoL**

The radioactive oligosaccharides obtained from exoL exoB exoR cells could be resolved into two major components by TLC: a compound with the same mobility as the disaccharide maltobiose and a minor compound with the mobility of the exoA intermediate (Figure 2, lane 5). When exoL cells were labeled with UDP-[14C]glucose, radioactivity appeared only in the maltobiose-sized compound (data not shown). When exoL oligosaccharides were chromatographed on Bio-Gel P-4, the major compound had the same mobility as the disaccharide cellobiose (K = 0.90 for both; see Figures 3f and 3g). Therefore, it seems likely that exoL strains accumulate the lipid-linked disaccharide Glu-β(1,3)-Gal and that ExoL catalyzes the addition of the second glucose onto the lipid-linked oligosaccharide.

**exoM**

Oligosaccharides released from the lipid fraction of an exoM exoB exoR strain could be resolved into two major species by TLC: a component with a mobility similar to that of the trisaccharide maltotriose and a component that migrated faster than glucose (Figure 2, lane 6). A minor component with the mobility of the exoL intermediate was also present. A minor slow-migrating component was sometimes present in preparations of exoM oligosaccharides but accounted for very little of the incorporated radioactivity. We hypothesize that the compound that migrated like maltotriose is the trisaccharide Glc-β(1,4)-Glc-β(1,3)-Gal and that the fast-migrating substance is the acetylated trisaccharide, because acetate is present on the third sugar of the octasaccharide succinoglycan subunit (see Figure 1) and it has been shown that oligosaccharides with an acetyl substituent have a higher mobility than the corresponding unmodified oligosaccharides when chromatographed in this TLC system (Tolmasky et al., 1982). When chromatographed on Bio-Gel P-4, these oligosaccharides were resolved into three components: a component in the position of cellobiose (K = 0.90), a component (K = 0.81) near the position of cellotriose (K = 0.82), and a component in the position of a larger compound (K = 0.77). This result is also consistent with the hypothesis of a trisaccharide and an acetylated trisaccharide, because hydrophobic substituents such as acetate cause an increase in apparent molecular weight of compounds chromatographed on Bio-Gel P-4.

To address this question further, we treated exoM intermediates with 10 mM KOH to remove esters. We found that the peak that represented the larger compound (K = 0.77) disappeared after this treatment and the radioactivity in the putative trisaccharide peak (K = 0.81) increased, suggesting that the larger compound was indeed an acetylated trisaccharide (Figures 4a and 4b). However, some radioactivity also appeared in the putative dimer peak. This could be due to some degradation of intermediates by the treatment, but this is unclear. When KOH-treated exoM intermediates were analyzed by TLC, the fast-migrating compound attributed to an acetylated intermediate was absent (data not shown). These data are consistent with the hypothesis that exoM strains accumulate a lipid-linked trisaccharide intermediate that can be acetylated. Therefore, it seems likely that ExoM is involved in the addition of the fourth sugar to the lipid-linked succinoglycan intermediates and that acetylation of lipid-linked succinoglycan intermediates can occur prior to the assembly of the complete octasaccharide subunit.

**exoO**

Oligosaccharides released from the lipid fraction of exoO exoB exoR cells could be resolved into two major species by TLC: a component with a mobility slightly lower than that of the tetrasaccharide maltotetraose and a component with the mobility of maltobiose (Figure 2, lane 7). The faster-migrating compound is absent after treatment of these oligosaccharides with 10 mM KOH (data not shown), and therefore we hypothesize that it is an acetylated tetrasaccharide. When chromatographed on Bio-Gel P-4 (Figure 3j), the exoO oligosaccharides were resolved into two components, a component (K = 0.75) with a mobility near that of cellotetraose (K = 0.76) and a component with the mobility of a larger compound (K = 0.70). After treatment of these oligosaccharides with 10 mM KOH, the K = 0.70

component was absent (Figures 4c and 4d). These results are consistent with the hypothesis that exoO cells accumulate the lipid-linked tetrasaccharide Glc-β(1,4)-Glc-β(1,4)-Glc-β(1,3)-Gal and the acetylated tetrasaccharide. Therefore, it seems likely that ExoO is involved in the addition of the fifth sugar to the lipid-linked intermediates.

**exoU**

The major components released from the lipid fraction of an exoU exoB exoR strain showed mobilities on TLC similar to maltohexaose, maltopentaose, and maltotriose, although there was a minor compound with a mobility near that of maltooctase (Figure 2, lane 8). When these oligosaccharides were chromatographed on Bio-Gel P-4 (Figure 3k), one major peak with two shoulders was obtained (peak I, K = 0.63), in a position that indicates that it is composed of compounds larger than the exoO intermediates but smaller than wild-type intermediates. A small peak with a mobility slightly higher than that of full-size wild-type intermediates was also present (peak II, K = 0.38). This peak may indicate that some polymerization of the lipid-linked oligosaccharides produced by an exoU strain occurs, to give a dimer of the truncated subunit. This hypothesis is consistent with the phenotype of exoU mutant strains, which produce a small amount of Calcofluor-binding material but do not produce enough polysaccharide in culture supernatants to isolate for analysis (M. A. Glucksmann, T. L. R., and G. C. W., submitted).

When exoU oligosaccharides were treated with KOH (Figures 4e and 4f), the major compound produced (K = 0.68) had a mobility slightly higher than that of cellopentaose (K = 0.70). The mobility of the peak II component was also reduced (K = 0.43). The relationship of the mobility of the major deesterified compound to the mobility of cellopentaose was consistent with the accumulation of a lipid-linked intermediate of five or six sugar residues. However, as discussed below, analysis of the partition coefficient of the deesterified exoU intermediate in relation to those of the deesterified intermediates from all the mutant strains was more consistent with an intermediate of five sugar residues. Therefore, we hypothesize that ExoU catalyzes the addition of the sixth sugar.

**exoW**

Oligosaccharides released from the lipid fraction of exoW cells showed a complex pattern of spots on TLC (Figure 2, lane 9), but this pattern was different from that produced by oligosaccharides from the wild-type strain. When chromatographed on Bio-Gel P-4 (Figure 3l), these oligosaccharides were resolved into three major components: two components (region I) with mobilities between those of the oligosaccharides from the exoU and wild-type strains (K = 0.58 and K = 0.61) and one component (II) with a higher mobility (K = 0.30). As hypothesized for the exoU mutant strain, component II may result from a small amount of polymerization of the altered succinoglycan subunits accumulated by exoW.

When exoW oligosaccharides were treated with KOH, the larger component in region I (K = 0.58) disappeared. Therefore, it is probable that this component is an ace-

tylated oligosaccharide and the remaining component (K = 0.62) is the unmodified oligosaccharide. The putative unmodified oligosaccharide had a higher mobility than that produced by the exoU strain, indicating that it is larger. As discussed below, the mobility of the unmodified exoW intermediate was most consistent with an oligosaccharide of six sugar residues. Therefore, we hypothesize that ExoW catalyzes the addition of the seventh sugar to the growing lipid-linked subunit.

**exoV**

Oligosaccharides isolated from the lipid fraction of an exoV strain were also resolved into a complex pattern of spots on TLC (Figure 2, lane 10), which was consistently different from the pattern observed from wild-type intermediates. When chromatographed on Bio-Gel P-4, a major peak (I, K = 0.49), and a minor peak of higher mobility (II, K = 0.23) were observed (Figure 3m). The major peak appeared to be a complex of more than one component. When exoV oligosaccharides were treated with 10 mM KOH, the positions of both peaks were shifted. The mobility of the major component of the KOH-treated exoW oligosaccharides was the same as that of the unmodified octasaccharide subunit of succinoglycan (K = 0.53 for both, Figure 4j and 4k). Therefore, exoV strains appear to accumulate an octasaccharide subunit that lacks the pyruvate substituent. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that the deduced amino acid sequence of ExoV shows significant similarity to GumL (M. A. Glucksmann, T. L. R., and G. C. W., submitted), the ketolase responsible for transferring pyruvate to the terminal sugar of the side chain of xanthan gum (Vanderslice et al., 1988).

Figure 6. Proposed Model of the Succinoglycan Biosynthetic Pathway

Assembly of succinoglycan subunits is shown taking place on lipid carriers on the cytoplasmic face of the cytoplasmic membrane, and the exo gene products are shown at their proposed stages of action. Subunit polymerization is represented as taking place on the periplasmic side of the cytoplasmic membrane, in analogy with O-antigen biosynthesis, although our experiments have not addressed the question of the topography of the assembly and export pathway. The components of the polymerized octasaccharide subunits are represented as follows: closed circles, glucose; open circles, galactose; triangles, the noncarbohydrate substituents.

the log of the molecular weight of an oligosaccharide and its partition coefficient, because their effects on the mobilities of oligosaccharides are not proportional to their molecular weight. However, the molecular weights of the deesterified oligosaccharide intermediates and the completely unmodified succinoglycan octamer and their partition coefficients would be expected to follow this relationship. The molecular weights of the major accumulated species of oligosaccharide for exoL, exoM, and exoO are predicted to correspond to those of a disaccharide, a trisaccharide, and a tetrasaccharide, respectively. Figure 5 shows K versus log M for these oligosaccharides and the unmodified octasaccharide. A linear relationship is observed, with a correlation coefficient of 0.991.

Because the sizes of the exoU and exoW oligosaccharide intermediates were more difficult to determine by comparison with the available oligosaccharide standards, two possibilities are shown for these intermediates: a hypothesis that the major accumulating species in exoU cells is a pentasaccharide and in exoW cells is a hexasaccharide and a hypothesis that exoU cells accumulate a hexasaccharide and exoW cells accumulate a heptasaccharide. As can be seen in Figure 5, the first prediction produces a much better fit in combination with the data from the other mutants. Therefore, it seems likely that ExoU is involved in the addition of the sixth sugar to the lipid-linked intermediate and ExoW is involved in the addition of the seventh sugar.

exoP, exoQ, and exoT

Oligosaccharides from exoP, exoQ, and exoT derivatives of an exoB exoR strain chromatographed like wild-type oligosaccharides on TLC (Figure 2, lanes 11, 12, and 13). The profiles obtained on Bio-Gel P-4 were also very similar to that of oligosaccharides from the wild-type strain (Figures 3c, 3d, and 3e). The profile of oligosaccharides from an exoQ strain did show a small difference, however: the minor component of high mobility present in the wild-type oligosaccharides (II, K = 0.18) was consistently absent in preparations of exoQ oligosaccharides. If this component does represent a dimer of octasaccharide succinoglycan subunits, then exoQ mutants may be defective in polymerization of the octasaccharide subunits. However, more evidence is needed to support this hypothesis.

Despite the fact that lipid-linked intermediates from exoP and exoT strains are indistinguishable from wild-type inter-

mediates, these strains release no succinoglycan into the medium and do not fluoresce under ultraviolet light when plated on medium containing Calcofluor. Therefore, the ExoP, ExoQ, and ExoT proteins may all be involved in stages of succinoglycan biosynthesis after subunit assembly, such as the polymerization of the octasaccharide subunits or the export of the completed polymer.

**Discussion**

In this work, we have assigned biosynthetic functions to the products of 12 exo genes located in a cluster on the second symbiotic megaplasmid of R. meliloti. These assignments were made by characterizing lipid-linked succinoglycan biosynthetic intermediates from exoB exoR derivatives of strains carrying mutations in these exo genes. Based on the intermediates accumulated in these strains, we propose that the exoF and exoY gene products are required for the addition of the initial galactose to the lipid carrier and that exoA, exoL, exoM, exoO, exoU, and exoW encode glucosyl transferases that act successively at the stages of the biosynthetic pathway shown in Figure 6. The products of the exoP, exoQ, and exoT genes are proposed to act in polymerization or transport of the completed subunits. exoH mutants were previously shown to produce polymer that lacks the succinyl modification (Leigh et al., 1987), and in other work we showed that the product of the exoZ gene is needed for acetylation of succinoglycan (Reuber and Walker, 1993). Therefore, we have included ExoH and ExoZ in the pathway shown in Figure 6. The remaining genes in the exo cluster, exoB, exoX, exoK, and exoN, have already been assigned functions. exoB is known to encode a UDP-glucose-4-epimerase, as discussed above (Buendia et al., 1991; Canter-Cremers et al., 1990), exoX encodes a negative regulator of succinoglycan synthesis (Reed et al., 1991b; Zhan and Leigh, 1990), and sequence analysis of the deduced amino acid sequences of ExoK and ExoN suggests that ExoK is a β-1,3-β-1,4 glucanase (Becker et al., 1993; M. A. Glucksman, T. L. R., and G. C. W., submitted) and ExoN is a UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (M. A. Glucksman, T. L. R., and G. C. W., submitted). Therefore, putative functions have now been assigned to all the known exo genes.

Because the exoP, exoQ, and exoT strains appear to accumulate complete succinoglycan subunits, the products of these genes may be needed for polymerization of the octasaccharide subunits or export of the completed polymer. Because exoQ cells do not accumulate the high mobility species attributed to a dimer of octasaccharide subunits, ExoQ may be needed for polymerization of the lipid-linked subunits, although further evidence is necessary to confirm this hypothesis. ExoP and ExoT may be involved in export of the completed polymer. The deduced amino acid sequences of ExoP and ExoT predict that they are membrane-bound proteins, and ExoT has significant similarity to the GumJ protein (M. A. Glucksman, T. L. R., and G. C. W., submitted), which is thought to be involved in export of xanthan gum (Vanderslice et al., 1988). It is of interest to note that most alleles of exoT are lethal unless

a mutation in exoB is also present in the strain (M. A. Glucksman, T. L. R., and G. C. W., submitted). Mutations that block polysaccharide transport are generally deleterious or lethal.

Polymerization and export of extracellular polysaccharide are poorly understood. Assembly of the lipid-linked intermediates is believed to take place on the periplasmic face of the inner membrane, where the cytoplasmic pools of sugar nucleotides are available to the sugar transferases. Studies of the synthesis of the S. typhimurium O-antigen indicate that polymerization of its lipid-linked subunits probably occurs on the periplasmic face of the membrane (Osborn, 1984). However, polymerization of type II capsular polysaccharides of Escherichia coli is thought to take place in the cytoplasm (Jann and Jann, 1991). If succinoglycan were polymerized in the periplasm, a translocating enzyme would be necessary to flip the subunits to the periplasmic face of the membrane. The mechanism of export of the completed polymer is not known. Because succinoglycan is a very large polymer, with a molecular mass of approximately 10⁶ daltons, it is tempting to speculate that the polymer is exported as it is being polymerized. If succinoglycan subunits are polymerized in the periplasm, the completed polymer might be extruded through a pore-like outer membrane complex. If polymerization occurs on the cytoplasmic face of the inner membrane, transport might occur through a protein complex that creates a junction between the inner and outer membranes. Such complexes have been postulated to be involved in type I sec-independent pathways of protein secretion (Salmond and Reeves, 1993).

Previous genetic results correlate with the gene assignments presented in this model. In earlier work, we showed that mutations in exoL, exoM, exoP, exoQ, and exoT are lethal in combination with the exoR95 mutation, which increases the expression of the exo genes (Reuber et al., 1991). We hypothesized that this lethality is due to the accumulation of unpolymerizable succinoglycan intermediates, because the polyprenyl carriers are also needed for cell wall and lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis (Sutherland, 1982). The biosynthetic functions we have assigned to the exoL, exoM, exoP, exoQ, and exoT gene products correlate well with this hypothesis: mutations in all of these genes cause the accumulation of lipid-linked intermediates. Mutations in exoY, exoF, and exoB, which block accumulation of lipid-linked intermediates completely, are not lethal in combination with exoR. Interestingly, we have recently found that mutations in exoU, exoW, and exoV are lethal in combination with exoR, although these mutants appear to be able to carry out some polymerization of lipid-linked subunits. However, this process appears to be very inefficient, because these strains make no polysaccharide that can be isolated from culture medium (M. A. Glucksman, T. L. R., and G. C. W., submitted). Therefore, it is possible that, in an exoR background, polymerization of the altered lipid-linked subunits is much slower than their production and they become toxic to the cell. Two mutations that cause accumulation of lipid-linked intermediates are not lethal in combination with exoR: exoA, which accumulates only lipid-linked galactose, and exoO, which

accumulates a putative lipid-linked tetrasaccharide. The transfer of galactose-1-phosphate from UDP-galactose to the lipid carrier is reversible by UMP in Salmonella (Osborn and Yuan Tze-Yuen, 1968). However, we were unable to demonstrate reversibility of this reaction by UMP in permeabilized R. meliloti cells. It is also possible that lipid-linked galactose can enter another biosynthetic pathway. Strains carrying mutations in exoO produce some normal polysaccharide (M. A. Glucksmann, T. L. R., and G. C. W., submitted). Therefore, it appears that another transferase can substitute for the function of ExoO in vivo to the extent that lipid-linked intermediates do not accumulate.

Results from cross-complementation studies with exo genes from R. meliloti and Rhizobium sp. strain NGR234 (Zhan et al., 1990) also correlate well with the pathway we have proposed. NGR234 produces an exopolysaccharide that has considerable structural similarity to succinoglycan: the first five sugars and linkages of the backbone of NGR234 exopolysaccharide are the same as the backbone of succinoglycan and the first sugar of its side chain. Zhan et al. (1990) found that NGR234 has genes that are functionally equivalent to the R. meliloti exoF, exoA, exoL, and exoM genes, and we have demonstrated that the products of these genes are involved in the addition of the first four sugars of succinoglycan.

The finding that exoY encodes a galactose transferase is significant, because exoY had previously been shown to interact with the negative regulatory gene exoX (Reed et al., 1991b; Zhan and Leigh, 1990). When exoX is present on a multicopy plasmid, succinoglycan production is abolished. However, this inhibition of succinoglycan production is overcome if exoY is also present in multicopy. Therefore, it is apparently the balance of these two gene products that regulates succinoglycan synthesis. Mutations in exoX or multicopy exoX do not significantly affect the activity of translational TnphoA-generated fusions to several exo genes; therefore, exoX is postulated to regulate succinoglycan synthesis posttranslationally (Reed et al., 1991b; Zhan and Leigh, 1990). The identification of ExoY as a galactose transferase suggests that ExoX acts to regulate succinoglycan synthesis by directly inhibiting the first biosynthetic step.

Our results indicate that, for the first seven sugars in the octasaccharide subunit, each sugar addition is catalyzed by a separate transferase. In this respect, succinoglycan biosynthesis resembles the well-understood systems of Salmonella lipopolysaccharide core (Rick, 1987) and O-antigen (Jiang et al., 1991) biosynthesis and of xanthan gum biosynthesis (Vanderslice et al., 1988). However, we have not identified the transferase responsible for the addition of the eighth sugar. Another transferase gene may remain to be identified. If this is the case, this transferase gene is probably located outside of the exo gene cluster, because all the known genes in the exo region have been investigated. It is also possible that one of the identified transferases catalyzes more than one sugar addition. A possible candidate would be ExoW, which catalyzes the addition of the seventh sugar, because both the seventh and eighth sugars are β-1,3-linked glucose residues. However, at least two transferases that can catalyze the formation of two different linkages have been described (Kukowska-Latallo et al., 1990; Vimr et al., 1992). Therefore, it could also be possible that another of the exo gene products could form both a β-1,3 and a β-1,4 or β-1,6 linkage.

We have postulated that the acetyl substituent is added to the lipid-linked intermediates at the three-sugar stage, because we found that the acetate could be added to the trisaccharide intermediates accumulated in an exoM strain. A similar result was reported for acetylation of the biosynthetic intermediates of xanthan gum (Ielpi et al., 1982). Xanthan gum is composed of pentameric subunits with a backbone of two glucose residues and a side chain of two mannose residues and one glucuronic acid residue. The third sugar of the subunit, mannose, is acetylated. If addition of the fourth sugar is blocked, acetylation of the mannose can still occur. More recently, it has been shown that these acetylated three-sugar subunits can be polymerized to yield an altered form of xanthan gum (Betlach et al., 1987). However, in earlier studies of succinoglycan biosynthesis, Tolmasky et al. postulated that the acetyl substituent is added to the octasaccharide subunit, because octasaccharide intermediates without acetate could be identified (Tolmasky et al., 1982). Several explanations for these observations can be proposed. It is possible that acetylation of succinoglycan intermediates can take place at any stage after addition of the third sugar. It is also possible that the acetyl substituent can no longer be added to octasaccharide intermediates and subunits lacking acetate are polymerized to form succinoglycan that does not have an acetyl substituent on every subunit. Finally, it is possible that the acetylated lipid-linked trisaccharide is not a normal intermediate in the biosynthetic pathway. The lipid-linked trisaccharide intermediates might normally be rapidly converted to octasaccharide intermediates before they can be acetylated, but if these lipid-linked trisaccharide intermediates are allowed to accumulate, they are eventually recognized by the acetylase. If this is the case, it is even possible that acetylated lipid-linked trisaccharide cannot be converted to an octasaccharide subunit. More data will be needed to distinguish among these possibilities.

The exo region of R. meliloti has recently been sequenced (Becker et al., 1993; Buendia et al., 1991; Müller et al., 1993; Reed et al., 1991b; M. A. Glucksmann, T. L. R., and G. C. W., submitted). This combination of sequence information and known gene functions will be relevant to the biosynthesis of other polysaccharides of biological interest. Currently, complete sequence information with gene functions has been published only for Salmonella lipopolysaccharide O-antigen (Jiang et al., 1991) and xanthan gum (Capage et al., 1987; Vanderslice et al., 1988), although some information is available about biosynthetic genes for capsular polysaccharides of E. coli (Boulnois and Jann, 1989; Pazzani et al., 1991). The finding that RfbP of S. typhimurium is homologous to ExoY of R. meliloti (Müller et al., 1993), which correlates with the identical functions proposed for these two proteins, suggests that such sequence homologies among glycosyl transferases may be informative in other systems.

Experimental Procedures

### Bacterial Strains and Media
R. meliloti was grown in LB medium (Maniatis et al., 1982), with 2.5 mM MgSO₄ and 2.5 mM CaCl₂ added. Antibiotics were used at the following concentrations: streptomycin, 500 μg/ml; neomycin, 200 μg/ml; gentamicin, 20 μg/ml; spectinomycin, 100 μg/ml; trimethoprim, 300 μg/ml. Calcofluor white M2R (Cellufluor, Polysciences) was added at 0.02% to LB agar buffered with HEPES (N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N-2-ethanesulfonic acid) at pH 7.4.

### Genetic Methods and Southern Hybridization
Triple mutant exo exoB exoR strains were constructed by transduction of Tn5 or kanamycin cassette insertions using φM12 as described previously (Finan et al., 1984). The exoA, exoF, exoL, exoM, exoO, exoP, exoQ, exoT, exoU, exoV, exoW, and exoY genes are closely linked to exoB. Three strategies were used to construct the exo exoB exoR strains: First, for the exo::Tn5 insertions most closely linked to exoB (exoQ332::Tn5 [Long et al., 1988], exoF55::Tn5 [Leigh et al., 1985], and exoY210::Tn5 [Zhan and Leigh, 1990]), we constructed doubly mutant exo exoB strains by transducing the exoB94::Tn5-233 mutation into the exo strain of interest and screening the resultant gentamicin- and spectinomycin-resistant colonies for retention of the neomycin resistance marker carried by the Tn5. The two linked mutations were then cotransduced into Rm8395, which carries the exoR95::Tn5-233 mutation (Reed et al., 1991b), by selecting for the neomycin resistance carried by the exo::Tn5 insertion. Second, for some exo::Tn5 insertions located further from exoB (exoA31::Tn5 [Leigh et al., 1985], exoL431::Tn5, exoM457::Tn5, exoP468::Tn5, exoU357::Tn5 [Long et al., 1988], and exoT274::TnphoA [Reuber et al., 1991]), the exo::Tn5 insertion of interest was transduced into Rm8294, a strain that carries a Tn5-Tp insertion in exoB. Tn5-Tp is a derivative of Tn5 carrying trimethoprim resistance (Klein et al., 1988). The resulting colonies were screened for retention of trimethoprim resistance. The exoR95::Tn5-233 mutation was then transduced into these exo exoB294 strains. Third, for the exoO1 kanamycin cassette insertion and the exoV2::Tn5 and exoW28::Tn5 insertions (M. A. Glucksmann, T. L. R., and G. C. W., submitted), the insertions were recombined into the genome of Rm8294 from plasmids by introduction of an incompatible plasmid as described previously (Ruvkun et al., 1982). The linked exo and exoB294 insertions were then cotransduced into Rm8395. In all cases, DNA from all exo exoB strains and from the final exo exoB exoR strains was analyzed by Southern hybridization to ensure that the strains carried both the exo::Tn5 or exo::Km and the exoB::Tn5-233 or exoB::Tn5-Tp insertions and that no deletions or other rearrangements had occurred in the exo region. The probe used was derived from the cosmid pEX312, which covers the entire exo region (Long et al., 1988). Chromosomal DNA was isolated from R. meliloti by the method of Marmur (Marmur, 1961). Restriction digests were performed according to the specifications of the supplier (New England Biolabs). pEX312 was labeled with a nick translation kit (Bethesda Research Laboratories). Southern blotting and hybridization to GeneScreen Plus transfer membrane (New England Nuclear) were performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

### Preparation of Permeabilized Cells
A modification of the method of Tolmasky et al. (Tolmasky et al., 1982; Tolmasky et al., 1980) was used to prepare permeabilized cells. Cells were grown in LB to late log phase (OD₆₀₀ = 0.6–1.0), harvested by centrifugation, and washed in 70 mM Tris (pH 8.2). Washed cells were resuspended in Tris-EDTA solution (70 mM Tris, 10 mM EDTA [pH 8.2]) in a volume proportional to the OD₆₀₀ of the culture, to give a final cell concentration corresponding to 100 times an OD₆₀₀ of 1. Cell preparations were frozen and thawed three times and stored at –70°C until use. These frozen cell preparations were stable for several months.

### Isolation of Lipid-Linked Intermediates
Lipid-linked intermediates were isolated by a method derived from procedures previously described for X. campestris (Ielpi et al., 1981) and R. meliloti (Tolmasky et al., 1982; Tolmasky et al., 1980). For each reaction, 70 μl of permeabilized cells was incubated at 10°C for 30 min with 0.25 μCi of UDP-[¹⁴C]galactose (Amersham; 25 μCi/ml, 250–325 mCi/mmol), 500 μM UDP-glucose, 100 μM acetyl coenzyme A, 100 μM succinyl coenzyme A, 100 μM phosphoenol pyruvate, and 12 mM MgCl₂ in a final volume of 100 μl. Alternatively, to label intermediates with [¹⁴C]glucose, 0.25 μCi of UDP-[¹⁴C]glucose (Amersham; 25 μCi/ml, 295 mCi/mmol) and 100 μM UDP-galactose were used in the reaction mixture, with the other components as given above. Reactions were stopped by addition of 0.5 ml of ice-cold Tris-EDTA and centrifuged, and the cell pellets were washed twice with 0.3 ml of Tris (pH 8.2) (no EDTA). The washed cell pellets were extracted twice with 100 μl of chloroform-methanol-water (1:2:0.3). One-tenth of this chloroform-methanol-water extract was counted to determine incorporation of radioactive sugars into lipid-linked material, and the rest was dried in a Speed-Vac (Savant). The dried material was resuspended in 0.01 N trifluoroacetic acid and heated at 90°C for 20 min to hydrolyze the saccharides from the lipid carriers. The solutions were then cooled and neutralized with 2 μl of 1 M NH₄OH. The freed saccharides were dephosphorylated overnight at 37°C with bovine alkaline phosphatase, type VII-S (Sigma), in the following buffer: 10 mM glycine-NaOH (pH 10), 0.5 mM MgCl₂. The saccharides were then extracted from the lipid fraction with 500 μl of chloroform-methanol (2:1). The aqueous phase was dried down in a Speed-Vac, and the labeled intermediates were analyzed.

### TLC
TLC was carried out on silica gel 60 (0.25 mm; Merck). In general, oligosaccharide intermediates from one-fourth of a reaction in a volume of 1 μl were combined with 1 μl of a maltooligosaccharide solution (MD6-1, 30 mg/ml; V-Labs) that served as a carrier and an internal standard and were spotted onto the plate. TLC plates were developed in propanol-nitromethane-water (50:20:20) for three ascents, sprayed with En³Hance spray (New England Nuclear), and autoradiographed for 1–2 days. To visualize unlabeled sugar standards, the TLC plate was sprayed with 5% H₂SO₄ in ethanol and heated to 110°C for 5–10 min.

### Gel Filtration Chromatography
Gel filtration chromatography was carried out on a Bio-Gel P-4 (400 mesh; Bio-Rad) column (1 × 113 cm) in 0.1 M pyridinium acetate (pH 5). Fractions of 0.5 ml were collected. Radioactivity was detected by liquid scintillation counting in Hydrofluor (National Diagnostics), and unlabeled sugars were detected by the anthrone assay (Loewus, 1952). Mannose, either unlabeled or tritiated as appropriate, was used as a marker for the salt volume, and bovine serum albumin was used as a marker for the void volume. The partition coefficient, K, was determined for each peak by the following formula: K = (Vₑ – Vᵥ) / Vₛ, where Vₑ represents the elution volume of the center of the peak, Vᵥ represents the void volume, and Vₛ represents the volume of the stationary phase, or the salt volume minus the void volume (Freifelder, 1982).

### Deesterification and Depyruvylation of Oligosaccharides
For removal of the acetyl, succinyl, and pyruvyl substituents, oligosaccharides were first desalted over Bio-Gel P-4 as described above and lyophilized. The acetyl and succinyl esters were hydrolyzed with 10 mM KOH for 5 hr at room temperature as described before (Tolmasky et al., 1982), except in the case of the full-sized octameric succinoglycan subunit. The ester substituents on the succinoglycan octamer were more resistant to hydrolysis and required treatment with 100 mM KOH for 5–16 hr. The pyruvate ketal was hydrolyzed with 50 mM oxalic acid at 100°C for 90 min (Osman and Fett, 1989).
