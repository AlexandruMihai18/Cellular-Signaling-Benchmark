**Summary** Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder of the central nervous system associated with progressive cognitive and memory loss. Molecular hallmarks of the disease are characterized by extracellular deposition of the amyloid β peptide (Aβ) in senile plaques, the appearance of intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFT), cholinergic deficit, extensive neuronal loss and synaptic changes in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus and other areas of brain essential for cognitive and memory functions. Aβ deposition causes neuronal death via a number of possible mechanisms including oxidative stress, excitotoxicity, energy depletion, inflammation and apoptosis. Despite their multifactorial etiopathogenesis, genetics plays a primary role in progression of disease. To date genetic studies have revealed four genes that may be linked to autosomal dominant or familial early onset AD (FAD). These four genes include: amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin 1 (PS1), presenilin 2 (PS2) and apolipoprotein E (ApoE). Plaques are formed mostly from the deposition of Aβ, a peptide derived from APP. The main factors responsible for Aβ formation are mutation of APP or PS1 and PS2 genes or ApoE gene. All mutations associated with APP and PS proteins can lead to an increase in the production of Aβ peptides, specifically the more amyloidogenic form, Aβ42. In addition to genetic influences on amyloid plaque and intracellular tangle formation, environmental factors (e.g., cytokines, neurotoxins, etc.) may also play important role in the development and progression of AD. A direct understanding of the molecular mechanism of protein aggregation and its effects on neuronal cell death could open new therapeutic approaches. Some of the therapeutic approaches that have progressed to the clinical arena are the use of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, nerve growth factors, nonsteroidal inflammatory drugs, estrogen and the compounds such as antioxidants, neuronal calcium channel blockers or antiapoptotic agents. Inhibition of secretase activity and blocking the formation of β-amyloid oligomers and fibrils which may inhibit fibrilization and fibrilization-dependent neurotoxicity are the most promising therapeutic strategy against the accumulation of β-amyloid fibrils associated with AD. Furthermore, development of immunotherapy could be an evolving promising therapeutic approach for the treatment of AD.

### INTRODUCTION

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is an irreversible, progressive neurodegenerative disorder that occurs gradually and results in memory loss, unusual behavior, personality changes, and a decline in thinking abilities. AD is named after Dr. Alois Alzheimer,¹ a German doctor who in 1907 noticed changes in the brain tissue of a woman who had died of an unusual mental illness. There is a loss of nerve cells in areas of the brain that are vital to memory and other mental abilities. In AD, the progressive nature of neurodegeneration suggests an age-dependent process that ultimately leads to degeneration of synaptic afferent systems, dendritic and neuronal damage, and the formation of abnormal protein aggregates throughout the brain.² The age-related susceptibility of the brain to neurodegenerative disease may be inherent in the susceptibility of individual neurons to various stressors.³ AD is accompanied by three main structural changes in the brain: diffuse loss of neurons, intracellular protein deposits termed neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) consisting of hyperphosphorylated tau protein and extracellular protein deposits termed amyloid (Aβ) or senile plaques, surrounded by dystrophic neurites.⁴,⁵ Genome-scale analysis revealed marked differences in gene expression between AD and normal brain.⁶ Such analysis is a potentially powerful approach to listing genes related to the pathogenesis. Modern imaging techniques have yielded tantalizing possibilities for determining whether an individual suffers from AD or some other form of dementia. These include positron emission tomography (PET), single photon emission tomography and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for measurement of brain functional activity, computer-assisted tomography hydrogen magnetic resonance spectroscopy (¹H MRS) and MRI for brain anatomy and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) for measurement of chemical composition. These techniques have been proved to be useful for positive diagnosis even in at-risk individuals and in distinguishing AD from other causes of dementia, such as vascular and frontotemporal dementia.⁷,⁸

Strategies to rescue or protect injured neurons usually involve promoting neuronal growth and functions or interfering with neurotoxic processes. Considerable research has been done on testing a large array of neuroprotective agents using animal models which mimic these disorders. Treatment to modify the disease is at present unavailable. However, understanding molecular mechanisms of AD have opened new opportunities for successful developments of drugs that prevent the generation of Aβ. Here, we review the molecular mechanism of AD pathogenesis and neuroprotective strategies which have been found to successfully ameliorate the neurodegeneration associated with AD. First we will give an overview of mechanisms of AD pathogenesis, then we will elaborate on a range of neuroprotective strategies.

# MOLECULAR MECHANISMS: OVERVIEW

Two major hypotheses have been postulated to explain the molecular mechanism of disease: the cholinergic hypothesis and the amyloid cascade hypothesis (Fig. 1). Many elegant studies support the cholinergic hypothesis, showing that a dysfunctional cholinergic system is sufficient to produce memory deficit in animal models that are analogous to Alzheimer's dementia. Brains from AD patients show degeneration of cholinergic neurons of the basal forebrain. A marked decline in cholinergic markers, choline acetyltransferase and acetylcholinesterase has been reported in the cerebral cortex of AD brain. Although cholinergic deficits cannot fully account for the overall neuropathological features observed in AD, it represents a significant part of AD etiology and further research regarding the preferential vulnerability of this system in AD is warranted. The other hypothesis, the amyloid cascade hypothesis states that the neurodegenerative process observed in AD brains is a series of events triggered by the abnormal processing of the APP that causes production, aggregation, deposition and toxicity of its Aβ derivative. Currently the amyloid cascade hypothesis has received considerable support from molecular genetic studies.

Several genes have been localized and/or identified in AD patients. It may be possible, for example, to correlate specific biochemical reactions with changes in these functions. At least four genes are implicated in the pathophysiology of AD such as (i) mutations of the APP gene on chromosome 21, (ii) polymorphism of the apolipoprotein E (ApoE) on chromosome 19 and mutations in the presenilin 1 (PS1) and presenilin 2 (PS2) genes on chromosome 14 and 1, respectively. Mutation in either the APP gene on chromosome 21 or presenilin (PS) gene that increase the Aβ production have been described in a modest number of patients with familial early onset AD. This peptide is derived from the membrane bound APP which can be processed via two distinct processing pathways: the amyloidogenic pathway that liberates the Aβ peptide and the nonamyloidogenic pathway which precludes the formation of Aβ and instead generates a secreted form of APP, sAPPα. The proponents of the amyloid cascade hypothesis argue the increased production of the longer amyloid peptide Aβ1–42, which forms the plaque core. This Aβ1–42 peptide goes on to induce all the subsequent pathology including tau aggregation, phosphorylation, neuronal attrition and chemical dementia.

However, all the molecular and cellular events occurring in different forms of AD cannot be explained by classical amyloid hypothesis. Mechanisms have emerged in which the fibrillar amyloid deposits does not act as the primary effector of this neurodegeneration. No correlation has been reported between senile plaques and the degree of dementia. Most of the experiments conducted on Aβ toxicity have been performed with a suspension of fibrils. Recent studies have detected novel and stable intraneuronal pools of insoluble Aβ deposits, which are generated in the endoplasmic reticulum/intermediate compartment (ER/IC), challenging the prevailing view that Aβ deposition is initiated in the extracellular space by the secretion of Aβ peptide. Accordingly, it has been observed that intracellular deposits of Aβ are mainly concentrated in detergent insoluble glycolipid enriched membrane domains. It is presently thought that the amyloidogenic process that converts soluble Aβ from its relatively inert form to its putative pathogenic state into amyloid fibrils, is a nucleation-dependent process that probably requires structural transitions of Aβ. An amyloid deposit might be seeded with Aβ derived locally from disintegrating neuronal membrane or from the insoluble pool rather than from diffuse Aβ deposits or from secreted Aβ. This internalization could lead to a protection of the cells against Aβ peptide by its total clearance or to cell death through long term intracellular aggregation.

## AMYLOIDOGENESIS

The term amyloid was coined by Virchow in 1854 being derived from amylose or amylon and means 'starch like'. The general nature of carbohydrate present in amyloid was known to be gly-

**Fig. 1 Major hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). According to amyloid cascade hypothesis, the pathogenesis of AD is initiated by the overproduction and extracellular deposition of amyloid β-peptide (Aβ) and intracellular deposition of neurofibrillary tangles (NFT). These depositions become the initiating factors for multiple neurotoxic pathways which may include excitotoxicity, Ca²⁺ homeostatic disruption, free radical production and inflammation in neurons. The cholinergic theory states loss of cholinergic markers such as choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and acetylcholinesterase (AchE) and decline in acetyl choline neurotransmitter leading to impairment of cognitive and memory functions.**

cosaminoglycans.³⁰ Amyloid is a generic term for the primarily extracellular accumulation of fibrillar protein deposits which have unique tinctorial and structural properties. At least 20 unrelated normally nonfibrillar proteins are known precursors of amyloid.³¹ Each is associated with a specific disease such as AD (Aβ), chronic hemodialysis (β₂-microglobulin), adult onset diabetes (amylin), inflammation associated amyloid (SAA, serum amyloid A), plasma cell dyscrasias and β-cell lymphomas (immunoglobulin light chains) and certain malignancies.³² Isolated amyloid fibrils when examined by negative staining or high-resolution electron microscopy are seen to be composed of multiple filaments or protofibrils twisted around each other forming non-branching fibrils with a crossed β-pleated sheet conformation.³³

Amyloid plaques in AD are not constituted by a single protein derived from APP. Many proteins, such as proteases, protease inhibitors, and microtubule-associated proteins (e.g., tau), are deposited in plaques. ApoE also associates with AD plaques. These additional plaque-associated proteins may contribute to the aggregation of the beta peptide into fibrils and the formation of insoluble Aβ arrays within the extracellular space. Regardless of the underlying amyloid fibril protein/peptide or associated disease, isolated amyloid fibrils when examined by negative staining or high resolution electron microscopy are composed of multiple filaments or protofibrils twisted around each other forming non-branching fibrils typically 7–10 nm in diameter with a crossed β-pleated sheet conformation.³⁴ Amyloid protein/peptide conformation is influenced by heparan sulfate (HS) class of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). With the possible exception of the β₂-microglobulin form of amyloid seen in patients undergoing chronic hemodialysis, HS or HS like GAGs are part of every form of amyloid so far examined, where studied, very high affinity binding occurs between individual extracellular basement membrane (ECBM) proteins (such as perlec an or laminin) and amyloidogenic protein such as serum amyloid A (SAA) or Aβ protein precursor (Aβ PP).³⁵ High affinity binding can also be demonstrated between these ECBM proteins and amyloidogenic protein precursors.³⁵ Further evidence of role of ECBM proteins in amyloidogenesis comes from reverse-transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis of perlec an, laminin β and λ chains and the α₁(IV)-collagen chain splenic mRNA levels during rapid AA-amyloid induction.³²,³⁶ These findings provide substantial evidence that ECBM proteins are involved in amyloidogenesis and that HS and perlec an in particular play an important role. While the GAGs and other ancillary components contribute in the genesis of amyloid, much remains to be explored concerning mechanism of formation of proteinaceous fibrils in amyloidogenesis.

Aβ has the propensity of self-aggregation and facilitate nucleation-dependent polymerization of the shorter form.³⁷ Studies have shown that aggregation might be modulated by some of the proteins present in senile plaques. Factors responsible for or inducing aggregation of peptide, as well as the cellular context in which it occurs, have yet to be established. All evidence in favor of fibrillation, over production of Aβ, decreased clearance of secreted Aβ and involvement of aggregating factors, might lead to neurodegeneration.²³

### Role of APP and secretases

Amyloid precursor protein is a 770 residue ubiquitous glycosylated transmembrane protein with a large hydrophilic amino-terminal extracellular domain, a single hydrophobic putative transmembrane domain and a small carboxy-terminal cytoplasmic domain.³⁸ It is the source of Aβ peptide found in neuritic plaques of AD. A single transmembrane domain consisting of 23 residues. APP is coded by a single copy gene located on the mid portion of the long arm of human chromosome 21. Recent data suggest that it functions as a kinesin-1 cargo receptor mediating the targeting of several synaptic proteins to the nerve terminals.³⁹ The APP proteins mature in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus and exhibit post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, glycosylation and sulfation.

However, the abnormal processing of the APP triggers the aggregation, deposition and toxicity of its Aβ derivative. The production of Aβ from APP is dependent upon the activities of two enzymes β-secretase and γ-secretase. On its way to the cell surface, two different proteases, α- and β-secretase can cleave at different positions within the APP molecule leading to the release of the large soluble N-terminal fragments, α-APPs and β-APPs, respectively (Fig. 2). Cleavage by α-secretase occurs within the region containing Aβ and thus precludes formation of Aβ. In contrast, β-secretase cleavage generates the free N-terminus of Aβ and is therefore considered the first critical step in amyloid formation.⁴⁰ Two C-terminal fragments C83 and C99 are also produced by α-secretase and β-secretase, respectively. Both C83 and C99 can be further cleaved by γ-secretase, within the APP transmembrane domain which leads to the release and secretion of Aβ from C99 and of p3, a shortened, presumably nonpathogenic, Aβ from C83. Mutations in genes of APP and presenilins have been shown to modify the processing of APP, through modulation of secretase activities. This altered processing leads to an increase in Aβ. It might trigger aggregation and induce the neurodegeneration process.⁴¹

#### Role of presenilins (PSs)

Presenilins are two proteins, presenilin 1 (PS1) and presenilin 2 (PS2), located in intracellular membranes such as nuclear envelop, the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus⁴² and encoded by two closely related genes PS1 and PS2. They are primarily expressed in neurons and are ubiquitously expressed within the brain. Structural studies have shown that PS1 and PS2 contain multiple transmembrane domains, with both amino and carboxy terminus as well as the large hydrophilic loop following the sixth transmembrane domain located facing the cytoplasm (Fig. 3). Both proteins have a similar predicted structure and share 67% amino acid identity. Endogenous PS1 and PS2 proteins are proteolytically cleaved to generate two polypeptides, the 46 kDa PS1 and 55 kDa PS2. The 46 kDa PS1 protein is cleaved to yield a 27-kDa amino (N)-terminal fragment (NTF) and 17-kDa carboxy (C)-terminal fragment (CTF). Whereas, the 55 kDa PS2 protein is cleaved to yield a 35 kDa NTF and a 20 kDa CTF.⁴³

The exact functions associated with PS protein have not been fully characterized yet. PS1 is required for proper formation of the axial skeleton and is involved in normal neurogenesis and survival of progenitor cells and neurons in specific brain regions. PS proteins have also been proposed to function in the control of apoptosis. PS1 is also involved in γ-secretase activity and binding of PS proteins to APP may play an important role in inducing intercellular signaling. Two conserved transmembrane aspartate residues in PS1 are critical for Aβ production, suggesting that PS1 either functions as an essential cofactor for γ-secretase, or is itself γ-secretase.⁴⁴ Like PS1, PS2 contains two transmembrane apparatus critical for γ-secretase activity. Furthermore, gene deletion of PS1 shows that it required for normal proteolytic cleavage of β amyloid precursor protein to generate Aβ.⁴⁵ This cleavage is under the control of an enzyme, the elusive γ-secretase that until now has remained unidentified.

The majority of early onset familial AD (FAD) cases are caused by mutations within the PS genes. More than 40 mutations have been described in the gene for PS1 that can subsequently

result in FAD. Mutations in both of genes selectively increase the production of Aβ42 in cultured cells and in the brains of transgenic mice and are linked to early FAD.¹⁹,²¹,⁴⁰,⁴⁵ Aβ42, the more amyloidogenic form of Aβ, can aggregate to form diffuse and neuritic amyloid plaques, thus suggesting that the influence of PS proteins on the production of Aβ42 may be an initiating event for developing AD. Mutations in the PS1 gene may also facilitate neuronal apoptosis by destabilizing β-catenin (i.e., part of the PS protein complex), thus predisposing individuals to early onset FAD.

In recent years, a growing list of proteins interacting directly or indirectly with PSs have been established: tau and one of its kinases, glycogen synthase kinase 3β, filamin, an actin binding protein, β-catenin, Gₛ protein calsenilin and μ-calpain.⁴⁶⁻⁴⁸ Expression of mutated PS and over expression of PSs in transfected cells have been reported to increase sensitivity to apoptosis.⁴⁹ PS2 appears to play a direct role in fas-mediated apoptosis.²³ PS1 may be acting as an anchor protein that directs the activity of related kinases and phosphatases.⁴⁹ Mutated PSs destabilize Ca²⁺ homeostasis, possibly through calsenilin, a calcium-binding

protein.⁴⁷ This neuronal protein interacts with the carboxy-terminal end²³ of both PS-1 and PS-2. Furthermore, Par-4, a protein containing both a leucin zipper and a death domain implicated in apoptosis is over expressed in AD brain and mutated PS-1 transfected cells.⁵⁰

Role of ApoE

ApoE is a 34 kDa lipid transport protein encoded by a four exon genes located on the long arm of chromosome 19 and has been linked to the pathogenesis of AD.⁵¹,⁵² It is localized normally in oligodendroglia, astrocytes, and microglia, the supporting and defensive cells of the brain. The amino acid sequence of the protein is essentially identical in many species. Thus, it is likely to be a protein essential for life functions. In fact, ApoE acts as a lipid carrier protein and suggested to play a role in transport of phospholipids and cholesterol. It was first identified and studied extensively in the context of atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease. In the brain, it is thought to have a role in repair of nerve cells in response to damage. ApoE deficiency has been shown to

adversely affect outcome after transient cerebral ischemia and head trauma. *In vitro* studies demonstrated that ApoE protects mixed neuronal-glial cells cultures against irreversible oxidative injury from H₂O₂ by reducing secondary glutamate excitotoxicity.⁵³ Evidences have shown that the level of ApoE could have a specific impact on hippocampus degeneration, particularly by oxidative metabolism. Besides its role in lipid integrity and synaptic plasticity, ApoE could also directly or indirectly interfere the status of some antioxidants in the brain.⁵⁴

ApoE exists in three allelic variants, namely E₂, E₃, and E₄, with a frequency of 8%, 77%, and 15%, respectively. Biochemical tests have confirmed a direct interaction of ApoE with Aβ and with APP. Complex formation involves the carboxy-terminal domain of ApoE and is ApoE isoform specific. The association of ApoE and Aβ inhibits fibril formation.⁵⁵ ApoE₃ has been reported to protect neuronal cells against Aβ-induced toxicity, through complexation and internalization of Aβ via ApoE receptors.⁵⁶ The presence of the ApoE₄ gene increases the prevalence for atherosclerosis, coronary artery disease, and cerebrovascular ischemia.⁵⁷ Its presence is of interest in view of studies showing these conditions are significant AD risk factors.⁵⁸ ApoE₄ can also accelerate the process that leads to amyloid angiopathy in AD brain vessels, a condition that can lead to cortical hemorrhage.⁵⁹ It is associated with cerebral hypoperfusion in temporo-parietal brain regions of patients with AD.⁶⁰ It appears that the presence of E₄ allele is associated with an earlier age of onset. Inheriting ApoE₄ gene increases the risk of AD about fourfold and this risk increases further if the individual inherits this gene from both parents. In carriers of ApoE₄ allele, Aβ deposition in the cerebral microvasculature could be an important contributing source of chronic hyperfusion in AD. The ApoE₄ binds more rapidly to Aβ which might lead to increased deposits of amyloid. Aβ-ApoE₄ complex synergistically enhances vasoconstrictions.⁶¹ The precise

effects of vasoactive properties in the development of AD has yet to be explored. Should a marker like ApoE₄ prove to be an index for the risk of developing AD in population-based samples, it may be useful in the future as a screening tool to help assess the risk of developing AD.

### Role of tau proteins

Tau, a member of the microtubule-associated protein family, is a phosphoprotein with multiple phosphorylation sites and widely expressed in brain. The primary function of tau is to maintain microtubule stability.⁶² Besides this, it is the major component of the NFTs noted in AD (see Fig. 4). The tau and tangle hypothesis argues that in AD the normal role of tau in stabilizing microtubules is impaired and indeed, in diseased neurons microtubules are gradually replaced by tangles. At present much of what is known regarding tau hyperphosphorylation and cytoskeletal degeneration has come from studies aimed at understanding the neurotoxic effects of Aβ.⁶³,⁶⁴ Understanding how tau is produced and processed is important to researchers as they attempt to understand how AD unfolds in the human brain. Tau processing also may serve as a target for the development of new therapies to treat the disease. In AD, aggregated tau is hyperphosphorylated and phosphorylation of tau reduces its ability to bind microtubules.⁶⁵ Currently promising efforts are underway to establish phosphorylated tau in cerebrospinal fluid as a putative disease-specific biological marker for AD.⁶⁶

### MECHANISMS OF Aβ TOXICITY

Various mechanisms have been proposed to explain the pathway by which Aβ induces neuronal cell death, including intracellular calcium accumulation, reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide

productions, decreased membrane fluidity, alteration of the cytoskeleton and nucleus, redox-active iron, inflammatory or autoimmune processes and increased sensitivity along an apoptosis–necrosis continuum.²³,⁶⁷ All of these intracellular events converge to the ubiquitous pathways of necrosis or apoptosis.

### Contribution of ROS

ROS and RNS that are generated intracellularly and extracellularly by various mechanisms are among the major intermediary risk factors that initiate and promote neurodegeneration in idiopathic AD.⁶⁸⁻⁷¹ The central nervous system is specially vulnerable to oxidative stress as a result of the brain's high oxygen consumption, abundant lipid content, and relative paucity of antioxidant compounds compared with other tissues.⁷² Evidence for increased oxidative damage in AD includes studies showing that brain tissue from AD patients has higher levels of oxidized protein,⁷¹,⁷³ advanced glycation end products⁷⁴ and 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) derived adducts, a marker of peroxidation,⁵²,⁷⁵ than tissue from nondemented elderly controls (Fig. 5). Lipids are modified by ROS and there is a strong regional correlation between lipid peroxides, antioxidant enzymes, the presence of senile plaques and NFT in AD brain.⁷⁶ The Aβ induces lipoperoxidation of membranes⁷⁷ and lipid peroxidation products that are involved in modification of proteins by covalent binding. 4-HNE, an aldehyde product of membrane lipid peroxidation, generated following exposure of neuronal membranes to Aβ peptide binds directly to tau, a microtubule-associated protein inhibiting its dephosphorylation. The oxidative damage of protein generates an increase in carbonyl groups due to oxidation of sensitive amino acids. The carbonyl residues and protein nitration in AD brain may come from the reaction of peroxynitrite, a powerful oxidant produced from the reaction of O₂⁻ and NO with proteins. Furthermore, microglial cells present in senile plaques suggesting that damage in AD brain is also due to an autoimmune response from microglia which produces free radicals.

Studies have demonstrated that bursts of oxidant production as well as dramatic changes in the activities of various antioxidant defenses are closely associated with alterations in gene expression in a variety of tissues.⁷⁸ Attack of DNA by ROS, particularly hydroxyl radical (·OH) leads to the formation of approximately 20 major products.⁷⁹ Of the possible base adducts resulting from oxidative stress, one of the most prominent appears to be due to the hydroxylation of guanine at the C8 position to lead to the formation of 8-oxoguanine⁸⁰ and the corresponding formamidopyridine, 2,6-diamino-4-hydroxy-5-formamidopyridine, which results from ring openings.⁸¹ These markers of oxidative stress have been localized to NFT and senile plaques in AD brain.⁷⁴,⁸²,⁸³ DNA damage is a feature of neuron cell death that has been detected in AD and stroke patients⁸⁴ and in experimental models of these disorders.⁸⁵ Studies demonstrated an increased oxidative DNA damage,⁸⁶⁻⁸⁸ an increased helicase activity especially the activity of 8-oxoguanine glycosylase and decrease in base excision repair⁸¹ in AD brain. DNA damage induced by free radicals or enzymatic modifications can be a trigger that initiates the cell death programme.⁸⁹ These observations have been interpreted to suggest that in addition to the brain in AD being subject to increased oxidative stress, there also is decreased repair of oxidative damage leading to an accumulation of DNA errors, which may be important factor in the progression of neuronal loss in AD.

### Contribution of constitutive NO

NO is synthesized from L-arginine by a family of enzyme called NO synthases (NOS). In tissues NOS occurs in three isoforms: endothelial (eNOS), neuronal (nNOS) and inducible (iNOS). The first two are constitutively expressed and Ca²⁺ dependent, whereas, iNOS is Ca²⁺ independent.⁵⁷ The presence of constitutive and inducible forms of NOS suggests that they may have distinct functions. Indeed, much evidence has now been accumulated to demonstrate that NO has significant physiological roles in both the peripheral and CNS. In the brain, all three isoforms of NOS are present.⁹⁰ nNOS is expressed in neurons in diverse

**Fig. 5** Showing detailed schematic pathway of oxidative stress induced by β-amyloid protein (Aβ) aggregation induces metal catalyzed reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Proteins can be modified and cross-linked by glycation, autoxidation and reactive aldehydes and increasing the production of Aβ fibrils. The oligomers formed by the cross-linking of reactive Aβ, interact with advanced glycation end product (AGE) receptor (RAGE) and causes generation of ROS. AGE modification and the resulting cross-linking of protein deposits has been shown to occur in both senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) in AD. ROS cause damage to lipid by forming lipid peroxidation (LPO) and products such as malonaldehyde and 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE). 4-HNE binds directly to tau, a microtubule-associated protein, inhibiting its dephosphorylation. Aβ generated ROS also disrupts ion homeostasis, changing the function of ion motive ATPase and promoting the activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors which determine an increase intracellular Ca²⁺ levels. The alteration in Ca²⁺ homeostasis could also contribute to the toxic action of Aβ.

locations with different densities, including the striatum, cerebrum, medula oblongata, neocortex and hippocampus. iNOS is found predominantly in astrocytes and microglia and eNOS has been identified not only in endothelial cells but also in microvessels and motor neurons. In addition to regulating cerebral vasoreactivity, NO has been shown to possess various physiological roles. Exogenous and endogenous NO stimulates to release neurotransmitters. 91 In the presynaptic neurons, NO upregulates cyclic 3′,5′ guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) formation to maintain presynaptic glutamate release. Besides its putative role in learning and memory, NO also appears to participate in axonal remodeling during development. 90

The NO induced neurotoxicity has been extensively studied. NO synthesis is activated in cerebrovascular disease by release of glutamate accompanied by inhibition of its removal, leading to NMDA receptor overactivation and excess Ca²⁺ influx. NO can combine with superoxide anion (O₂⁻) to form peroxynitrite (ONOO⁻). The resultant RNS can induce significant oxidative stress that causes lipid peroxidation and produces functional alterations in proteins and DNA, eventually leading to neuronal death by damaging DNA, could also lead to poly-ADP-ribose polymerase overactivation, causing neuronal ATP depletion and death (Fig. 6). Evidence suggests that in AD, ONOO⁻ can both promote DNA fragmentation by oxidative damage and prevent protein phosphorylation by tyrosine nitration, thus disturbing signal transduction mediated by tyrosine kinase. 92,93 Recently, it has been found that NO switches on the overexpression of metallo-proteinases, particularly MMP9 enzymes, which, in turn, chew up the environment that surrounds nerve cells. 94,95 The extracellular proteolytic cascades that are triggered by MMP9 can disrupt the extracellular matrix, contribute to cell detachment and lead to anoikis (apoptosis due to cell detachment from the substrate). 96 Thus the clinical convergence of advanced aging in the presence of NO and ONOO⁻ can, in time, contribute to exacerbation of the neuronal damage characteristic of brain of AD patients.

### Activation of inflammatory mediators

Studies are now addressing ongoing chronic inflammatory processes in the AD brain. Specialized cells in the brain appear to be involved in these inflammatory responses, which are unique to this site. Most important are astrocytes and microglial cells (Fig. 7). In AD, the number of reactive astrocytes is increased and the expression of phospholipase A₂ in these cells is upregulated, leading to increased arachidonic acid/prostaglandin inflammatory

![Diagram](attachment:diagram.png)

**Fig. 6 Role of constitutive nitric oxide (NO) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis.** NO is produced in the cell from L-arginine by the mediation of three NO synthase (NOS) isoforms: neuronal NOS (nNOS), inducible NOS (iNOS), and endothelial NOS (eNOS). Citrulline formed can leave the cell or be converted back to arginine. Superoxide anion radical (O₂⁻) is formed as a byproduct of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. In the case of hyperactivity of glutamate neurotransmission and mitochondrial dysfunction, the excessive intracellular calcium (Ca²⁺) accumulation leads to an abnormal activation of Ca²⁺-dependent enzyme, including nNOS. Then the excess of NO may react with O₂⁻ to form peroxynitrite (ONOO⁻). Mutations of presenilins (PSs) and amyloid precursor protein (APP) are associated with increased production of β-amyloid (Aβ). Neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) formation is the result of hyperphosphorylation of tau which leads to cell death. Apolipoprotein E (ApoE4) genotype may induce iNOS-mediated NO production. PSs have also been implicated in the process of tau hyperphosphorylation. Increased deposition of Aβ induces NO production either by disrupting Ca²⁺ homeostasis and subsequent increase in intracellular Ca²⁺ or by interacting with glial cells. NO and ONOO⁻ include a variety of neurotoxic mechanisms and these mechanisms are likely to be involved in the cell death and memory impairments observed in AD.

uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation and cellular respiration, thereby, compromising energy production.¹¹² Disturbed energy metabolism is an early, predominant feature of AD¹¹³ and the appearance of degenerating mitochondria in axonal terminals is apparently the first indication of plaque formation.¹¹⁴ Biochemical evidence has accumulated to show that the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) is defective in AD. Specifically, cytochrome C oxidase or complex IV is defective in AD.¹¹⁵,¹¹⁶ These ETC defects may arise from mutated and oxidatively damaged mitochondrial DNA in sporadic AD.⁸⁸,¹¹⁷,¹¹⁸ Since functional deficits of mitochondrial respiratory enzymes have been demonstrated and attributed to ROS injury, it is possible that age-related mitochondrial oxidative damage in synaptic terminal may be transcendentally important in brain aging especially to the age-dependent decline in memory and learning processes. The mitochondrial origin of pathogenesis for these defects is supported by the results of experiments with cytoplasmic hybrid or cybrid cells¹¹⁶ which recapitulate the ETC defects present in disease patients. Evidence shows the involvement of mutations in the mitochondrial genome in the genes encoding complex IV of the ETC.¹¹⁵ There is no doubt that mitochondria and the respiratory chain in particular have a central role in the downstream events that lead to cell death. However, how exactly this translates into loss of specific neuronal populations, including cholinergic forebrain, hippocampal pyramidal and cortical neurons, is unclear.

## THERAPEUTIC STRATEGY

With the advent of the new research on molecular mechanisms of AD pathogenesis, the promising prospects of development of drugs for the treatment of AD seem closer than ever. The principle strategies for the treatment of AD are summarized in Fig. 8. There probably is not one single cause, but several factors are important to describe the etiology of disease. Therefore, combination of compounds which act at more than one target site could be useful for the treatment. The classical lipophilic free radical scavenger α-tocopherol, which represents a phenolic structure, has been employed with some success in a clinical multicentre trial of AD. Owing to the beneficial effects of α-tocopherol and ascorbic acid in reducing the free radical load in hippocampus and cerebral cortex,¹¹⁹ a considerable interest in the use of these vitamins for treatment of AD has been made. Both α-tocopherol and ascorbic acid have been shown to slow the progression of the disease and reduce the risk for AD.⁷² Relatively long term antioxidant treatment may delay the onset of disease. Particularly, high risk group (smokers, individuals over the age of 65 years) may start taking regular antioxidants and/or bioenergetic supplements.

Up-regulation of multiple ROS-scavenging enzyme capacities which may be accomplished with various neurotrophins¹²⁰ may provide a mechanism for the prevention of neurotoxicity. Cholinergic drugs are routinely used in the treatment of AD to improve cognitive functions. These drugs together with multiple antioxidants have been proposed to be more effective in the treatment of AD than the individual agents alone.⁷⁰ Preventions of mitochondrial oxidative damage and mitochondrial mutations have received considerable interest for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders.¹¹³,¹²¹ Coenzyme Q10, L-carnitine and creatine which have roles in brain energy metabolism and ATP generation may be used as potential therapeutic target.¹²²¹²⁴ Another potential therapeutic is brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) which stimulates the growth of parasympathetic ganglia in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) and dopaminergic substantia nigra, hippocampal, basal forebrain and motor neurons in the CNS. Infusion of nerve growth factor (NGF) in aged animals upregulates cholinergic activity in the basal forebrain and striatum

## Disturbed energy metabolism

It is well evident that sufficient energy is essential to maintain the signaling activities¹⁰⁷ and in establishing proper functioning of the various neuronal ionic pumps used in maintaining resting potential. Mitochondria integrate their bioenergetics with that of the cell and vary their respiration to match the cellular demand for ATP.¹⁰⁸ Neurons are highly dependent on glucose for ATP generation necessary for its various functions and produce ROS as by-products of the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. The ATP generated in synaptic terminals is necessary for synaptic transmission and its production depends on a well preserved mitochondrial structure and function.¹⁰⁹ When mitochondria fails to provide adequate energy, partial neuronal depolarization and loss of Ca²⁺ homeostasis occurs. Mitochondrial membrane depolarization, Ca²⁺ uptake and ROS production have been linked to neuronal apoptosis.¹¹⁰,¹¹¹ This could eventually disrupt the normal functioning of mitochondria, including impairment and the

Fig. 8 Schematic representation showing prevention and strategies of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The agents such as anti-excitotoxic, antiapoptotics, nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitors, bioenergetic supplements, antioxidants, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory cholinergic drugs and estrogens treat only the symptoms of neurodegeneration or result in modest, short term improvements in cognitive function. Because, therapeutic goal is reduction of amyloid β protein (Aβ) and neurofibrillary tangles (NFT), it should be possible to generate specific β- and γ-secretase inhibitors. The generation of specific protease inhibitor that penetrate blood-brain barrier and active or passive immunization are challenges for medicinal chemists and holds great potential for treating or preventing AD.

and improves learning and memory as well as motor performance.¹²⁵ Estrogens have been shown to modulate neurotransmission, acting as a free radical scavenger and activating nuclear estrogen receptor in intracellular signaling.¹²⁶ It prevents the formation of Aβ by promoting the non amyloidogenic α-secretase processing of APP.¹²⁷ Another hormone insulin which has been shown to regulate phosphorylation of tau protein that underlies neurofibrillary lesions in the brains of AD patients and also affects the metabolism of Aβ, the main constituent of AD amyloid pathology¹²⁸ highlighted new potential target for therapeutic intervention. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, which inhibit the synthesis of prostaglandins, reduce the rate of deterioration of cognitive functions in patients with advanced AD. Natural agents of food supplements that could have multiple properties (e.g., anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, improving mitochondrial energetics, etc.) and cross blood-brain barrier may apparently prevent or delay or maintain the individuals at their higher level of functioning. There is a growing interest in the use of polyphenolic antioxidants to reverse age-related decline in neuronal signal transduction and in cognitive and motor behavior deficits. Extract of *Ginkgo biloba* has been shown to have beneficial effects on cognitive function. We investigated neuroprotective properties of extracts of *Asparagus racemosus*, *Convolvulus pleuricaucas* and *Withania somnifera* against free radicals induced damage in different brain regions in experimental animals.¹²⁹,¹³⁰ However, the mechanisms underlying their neuroprotective effect are not fully understood. Clinical efficacy and potential toxicity of active compounds in trials require further assessment.

Blocking the proteolytic machinery that produces Aβ₄₂ is the preferred strategy. This could be accomplished either by reducing formation of APP or by inhibiting proteolysis of APP to Aβ₄₂. Inhibition of β- and γ-secretase activities and stimulation of α-secretase activity have been suggested to be the most promising strategy for neuroprotection.⁴⁰ Complete inhibition of either β or γ-secretase alone should be sufficient to block Aβ production completely. The generation of secretase specific protease inhibitors that penetrates the blood-brain barrier is a challenge for drug discoveries. However, the drug that blocks the function of γ-secretase might not be effective in patients developing AD by factors other than Aβ₄₂ accumulation. The toxic form of Aβ might be soluble oligomers. Therefore, agents that prevent Aβ nucleation could be more effective than those that merely block Aβ deposition.¹³¹ The anti-Aβ immunization either active or passive holds great promise in future for treating or even preventing AD.¹³²–¹³⁴

### CONCLUDING REMARKS

The fact that AD involves progressive cognitive deterioration, formation of neurofibrillary tangles, senile plaques and synapse and selective neuronal loss that progress slowly and leaves end stage patient’s bed ridden. Deposition of Aβ has been presented as major culprit of AD pathogenesis. The ultimate goal is to block the formation of Aβ oligomers and fibrils to inhibit the fibrilization and fibrilization-dependent neurotoxicity. Using this kind of approach, however need detailed study of molecular nature of secretases and also mechanism as to how do it interact with presenilin. Does it stop the cognitive decline in AD patients and what toxicity will β-and γ-secretases inhibitor have, present a major academic challenge and thus central to the future developments of a rational molecular therapy for AD. To date, it remains unknown in which percentage of patients hereditary factors are the cause of the disease. However, it is widely accepted that, apart from the above-mentioned mechanism of AD pathology, a substantial part of the disease is of multifactorial origin, with oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammation and environmental factors. For this reason, the treatment will also be complex and might require different interventions for treatment. Being multifactorial pathogenicity of the disease, it is our opinion that a combined molecular, genetic and biochemical approaches should be employed for the development of drugs that can delay the onset of AD. The knowledge derived from these approaches could be extended from animal models to therapy of symptomatic AD patients.
