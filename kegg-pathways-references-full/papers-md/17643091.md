# Small-molecule therapies for cardiac hypertrophy: moving beneath the cell surface

**Timothy A. McKinsey* and David A. Kass†**

Abstract | Pathological stress from cardiovascular disease stimulates hypertrophy of heart cells, which increases the risk of cardiac morbidity and mortality. Recent evidence has indicated that inhibiting such hypertrophy could be beneficial, encouraging drug discovery and development efforts for agents that could achieve this goal. Most existing therapies that have antihypertrophic effects target outside-in signalling in cardiac cells, but their effectiveness seems limited, and so attention has recently turned to the potential of targeting intracellular signalling pathways. Here, we focus on new developments with small-molecule inhibitors of cardiac hypertrophy, summarizing both agents that have been in or are poised for clinical testing, and pathways that offer further promising potential therapeutic targets.

### Sarcomere
The basic functional contractile unit of muscle. It is composed largely of the proteins actin and myosin.

Hearts are exposed to physiological stress from the demands of daily living and exercise, and pathological stress from cardiovascular disease. In this latter case, factors such as pressure and volume load, neurohormones and mutations in genes encoding sarcomeric proteins typically stimulate muscle growth — hypertrophy — which increases the risk of cardiac morbidity and mortality¹². Although hypertrophy has been traditionally viewed as a necessary first response to pathological stress that only later exacerbates disease, which might caution against efforts to directly prevent or reverse it, recent data suggest that hypertrophy in response to pathological stress may never be truly adaptive¹³⁴, and clinical studies support benefits from its inhibition⁵⁶.

Before considering specific inhibitors of cardiac hypertrophy, it is worth summarizing what one is trying to reverse. The heart is composed of multiple cell types, including muscle cells, fibroblasts, immune cells, extracellular matrix and vascular tissue, and all can contribute to greater wall mass. Hypertrophied hearts perform greater mechanical work, consume more energy and have limited reserve capacity, and the muscle is stiffer, which affects both diastolic and systolic function. Reversing these abnormalities is an aim of antihypertrophy treatments. In addition to suppressing growth and reducing fibrosis, such treatments should ideally also improve cardiac function.

From the standpoint of drug development, several questions should be kept in mind. Does an agent prevent hypertrophy development in hearts exposed to increased load? Can it reverse pre-existing pathological hypertrophy? The latter is less often studied, yet is clinically relevant. Does the agent prevent cardiac dilation, improve intrinsic muscle function, reduce fibrosis and improve cardiac vascular supply/demand balance? Last, does the agent enhance cardiac reserve capacity despite blocking the hypertrophic response? This last question is rarely addressed in animal models, but it is also relevant to clinical medicine.

Current small-molecule cardiovascular drugs that have antihypertrophic activity target outside-in signalling; they block neurohormones (catecholamines, angiotensin, aldosterone); or calcium triggers (L-type Ca²⁺-channel blockers); or target pathological load (vasodilators and diuretics). However, these vary in effectiveness⁷, and load-reduction efficacy depends on the pathway that is targeted. Recent efforts to suppress or reverse hypertrophy have turned to signalling inside the cardiac muscle cell, targeting cascades that ultimately alter gene and protein expression, cell enlargement and chamber remodelling (FIG. 1). These pathways have substantial redundancy, as revealed by persistent inducible hypertrophy in models in which one or another of the pathways is genetically inhibited. Although this poses a challenge to efforts to inhibit hypertrophy therapeutically, there are distal strategic nodes where signals converge and intrinsic pathways that serve as multi-effector brakes, and both of these are attractive targets. Small-molecule screens based on cellular phenotype could also lead to

Figure 1 | Targets for small-molecule drugs that modulate hypertrophic signalling.

Traditional approaches to suppressing hypertrophy have focused on outside-in signalling, targeting G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), ion channels such as L-type Ca²⁺ and Na⁺/H⁺ exchanger (NHE) blockers, integrins or cytokine receptors. Newer targets include those that influence oxidative stress, regulation of kinases and phosphatases, signalling modulators and interacting proteins.

the identification of agents that affect novel intracellular targets (FIG. 2). In this Review, we focus on recent developments with small-molecule hypertrophy inhibitors. We first present agents that have been in or are poised for clinical testing, and then discuss pathways at earlier development stages.

### Rho kinase inhibitors and statins

The Rho family of small GTP-binding proteins act as potent proximal molecular switches. Rho is stimulated by guanine nucleotide exchange factor proteins (GEFs) and is activated by G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) agonists, growth-factor receptors, integrins and cytokine receptors⁸ (FIG. 3). Once coupled to GTP, activated Rho stimulates downstream effectors, notably Rho-kinase, which has two primary isoforms, ROCK1 (also known as ROCK I, P160ROCK or ROKβ), and ROCK2 (also known as ROCK II or ROKα)⁹,¹⁰. ROCK expression is also stimulated by angiotensin and interleukin-1β (IL1β) through a protein kinase C/nuclear factor-κB (PKC/NFκB)-dependent pathway¹¹. Knockout of Rock isoforms in mice is embryonically lethal¹²⁻¹⁴, whereas 50% Rock1-knockdown does not blunt pressure-overload hypertrophy, but reduces fibrosis¹³.

ROCK has several major targets (FIG. 3), including myosin phosphatase target subunit 1 (MYPT1)¹⁵, which plays an important role in ROCK-mediated vascular smooth-muscle contraction. ROCK-activated MYPT1 inhibits myosin light-chain (MLC) phosphatase, enhancing MLC phosphorylation and augmenting myosin ATPase activity, and thereby the force and velocity of crossbridges¹⁶,¹⁷. Physiological effects include increased vascular tone, cell-stress fibre formation, migration and hypertrophy, and reduced expression of nitric oxide synthase (NOS). Cardiac troponin T is also a ROCK substrate, in which tyrosine phosphorylation reduces tension-Ca²⁺ sensitivity¹⁸. The phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) is another recently described ROCK substrate¹⁹ that has an important role in the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway, and regulates cellular growth, protein synthesis, survival and transcription²⁰. PTEN phosphorylation by ROCK reduces PI3K/Akt signalling, whereas ROCK inhibition activates the pathway, perhaps explaining the Akt activation seen in endothelial cells that are treated with ROCK inhibitors²¹. The Na⁺/H⁺ exchanger, which contributes to hypertrophy in part by increasing intracellular sodium and subsequently calcium via the Na⁺/Ca²⁺ exchanger²², is also activated by ROCK²³,²⁴.

Data supporting the contribution of ROCK to cardiac hypertrophy come largely from pharmacological studies with non-isoform-specific inhibitors²⁵,²⁶. Although initially synthesized as calmodulin antagonists, these drugs evolved into protein kinase inhibitors and then into more selective ROCK inhibitors. An early example was HA-1077 (fasudil) (TABLE 1), which was approved in Japan for the treatment of cerebral vasospasm in 1995. Subsequent drug development yielded Y-27632 (REF. 27) (TABLE 1), and together, use of these compounds has provided most of the data that support the antihypertrophic effects of ROCK inhibition. Animal models include angiotensin-II-stimulated hypertrophy in rats²⁸, apolipoprotein E (ApoE)-deficient knockout mice²⁹, post-infarction models³⁰ and hypertensive-hypertrophy Dahl salt-sensitive rats³¹. In addition to suppressing hypertrophy³⁰,³¹, ROCK inhibitors reduce fibrosis, suppress inflammatory cytokines (transforming growth factor-β2 (TGFβ2) and TGFβ3) and macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF)³⁰, and enhance cardiac function³². Antihypertrophic effects occur without significant changes in arterial pressure, supporting primary myocardial effects.

One limitation of existing ROCK inhibitors is their lack of enzymatic specificity. Both fasudil and Y-27632 also inhibit cGMP-dependent protein kinases at an IC₅₀ 10–20-times that for ROCK2 (REF. 27). Fasudil also inhibits PKA and Ca²⁺/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) with an IC₅₀ similar to that for PKG, whereas Y-27632 is less active against these kinases²⁷. Recent glycy derivatives of fasudil have yielded more specific ROCK inhibitors that have reduced activity

Figure 2 | Approaches to drug discovery for cardiac hypertrophy. **a** | Drug discovery typically involves the identification of potential drug targets and validation of a role for these targets in disease. Validation for cardiac hypertrophy involves gene transduction into cultured cardiomyocytes, production of transgenic and knockout mice, and pharmacological studies. Target discovery and validation often takes many years, thereby delaying the start of small-molecule-screening efforts, chemical optimization of hit compounds and in vivo testing to confirm that manipulation of the target will provide therapeutic benefit without unacceptable side effects. **b** | Future drug discovery for cardiac hypertrophy could include an alternative approach, in which the starting point is a ‘phenotype-based’ high-throughput screen for small-molecule inhibitors of cellular hypertrophy. Screening can be performed in biological systems, such as neonatal rat ventricular myocytes cultured in high-density formats and exposed to stimuli (stretch or hormones) to induce hypertrophy. This unbiased approach will yield classes of compounds that elicit a desired effect (for example, inhibition of pathological cardiac hypertrophy) without prior understanding of the targets of the small molecules. So, small molecules obtained from such screens could be used as tools to identify novel cellular regulators of cardiac hypertrophy that have been recalcitrant to classical discovery efforts. In addition, optimized analogues of hit compounds could be used to validate the target using animal models of pathological cardiac hypertrophy, thereby streamlining efforts to translate preclinical discoveries to clinical testing. It is important to note that chemical optimization is facilitated when the compound target is known, and thus efforts to identify the targets of small molecules will probably be initiated shortly following the demonstration of cellular efficacy and establishment of a structure–activity relationship for given classes of efficacious compounds.

against PKA and PKC ($1 \times 10^3$ greater IC$_{50}$), and IC$_{50}$ > $1 \times 10^2$ higher for CaMKII and PKG${}^{27}$. Additional studies are needed to test their efficacy, and other efforts are aiming to generate isoform-selective inhibitors.

Another way to inhibit Rho/ROCK and upstream Ras signalling is with the widely prescribed HMG-CoA (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A) reductase inhibitors, or statins${}^{33-35}$ (FIG. 3). In addition to blocking cholesterol synthesis, statins impede the activation of Ras by farnesylation (via farnesyl pyrophosphate), and geranylgeranylation of Rho (via geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate)${}^{36,37}$. This impairs membrane translocation and activation of both Ras and Rho, leading to inactivity. Simvastatin (TABLE 1) prevents angiotensin-stimulated neonatal myocyte hypertrophy and blocks RhoA and RAC1 GTP binding (RAC1 being linked to oxidative stress)${}^{38}$. Its *in vivo* antihypertrophic effect is similar to that of an antioxidant (*N*-acetyl cysteine), suggesting that RAC1 signalling dominates. Transgenic rats overexpressing human renin and angiotensinogen develop hypertrophy, hypertension and fibrosis that can be inhibited by cerivastatin${}^{39}$ (TABLE 1). Statin benefits have also been reported in the salt-sensitive rat${}^{40}$, and in rabbits harbouring an R403Q mutation in the myosin heavy chain (MHC), which is a model of genetic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy${}^{41}$. The role of Rho, ROCK, and RAC1 in the latter model is unclear, as none was inactivated by the

mTOR and Akt  

Rapamycin (TABLE 1) is a lipophilic macrolide with fungicidal properties that was first isolated from the soil bacterium *Streptomyces hygroscopicus*${}^{43}$. Screening for molecules affected by rapamycin led to the purification and cloning of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) in 1994 (REF. 44). mTOR is a member of the phosphoinositide-kinase-related kinase family, and is essential for cell growth, regulation of mRNA turnover, actin cytoskeletal organization, autophagy, protein stability, transcription and translation${}^{45}$. Its regulatory role in gene translation (FIG. 4) is principally effected by phosphorylation of ribosomal S6 kinase (S6K or p70${}^{S6K}$) and 4EBP1, a repressor of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E)${}^{46,47}$. mTOR is activated by growth factors and mechanical and energetic stimuli that converge on the tuberous sclerosis complex (the TSC1 gene product is hamartin; the TSC2 product is tuberin) upstream of the small G-protein Rheb${}^{48}$, which negatively regulates

those encoding natriuretic peptides and β-MHC, remains stimulated despite rapamycin treatment⁵⁴,⁵⁵. Rapamycin was also shown to regress pre-existing cardiac hypertrophy induced by pressure overload⁵⁶. Rapamycin is currently used as an immunosuppressant for transplant rejection, reflecting its broader impact on other cell systems. Improving cardiac targeting and/or modifying cell sensitivity will probably be important to its future use for cardiac hypertrophy.

The PI3K/Akt pathway modulates hypertrophy through other pathways besides mTOR. Hearts that lack Class Iₐ PI3K are reduced in size and show blunted hypertrophic response to physiological stimuli such as swimming⁴⁹, whereas mice that lack PTEN, an inhibitor of PI3K-stimulated signalling, have greater basal and stimulated hypertrophy⁵⁷. PI3K activates Akt, which in turn phosphorylates glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) (FIG. 4), another suppressor of hypertrophy that is negatively regulated by Akt (reviewed in REF. 58). GSK3β phosphorylates the transcriptional regulator myocardin⁵⁹, an important mechanism of its hypertrophy suppression. Although Akt is thought to regulate physiological hypertrophy⁶⁰, sustained or marked activation alters expression profiling⁶¹ to that typical of pathological hypertrophy and failure⁶²,⁶³. Akt intracellular localization may also determine its impact, with nuclear translocation providing anti-apoptotic⁶⁴ and antihypertrophic effects⁶⁵, while improving myocyte function⁶⁶. Enhancing the right type of Akt stimulation or preventing the wrong type remain intriguing approaches, although small-molecule approaches may be difficult owing to the pleiomorphic effects and ubiquitous expression of Akt.

Oxidative stress

Myocardial oxidative stress is generated by various enzymes, including NADPH oxidases (NOXs), xanthine oxidase (XO), mitochondrial electron transport chain complexes, and NOS⁶⁷ (FIG. 5). Oxidase-generated radicals are normally maintained at physiological levels by enzymatic antioxidants, including superoxide dismutase (SOD), which converts O₂⁻ to H₂O₂; catalase and glutathione peroxidases, which convert reduced glutathione (GSH) and H₂O₂ to H₂O and oxidized glutathione (GSSG); and glutathione reductase (GR), which reduces GSSG back to GSH. Antioxidant systems centrally involve thiol-disulphide oxidoreductase systems such as the cytosolic proteins thioredoxin (TRX) and glutaredoxin (GRX), each containing a signature -Cys-X-X-Cys- motif at their active sites. TRX operates with NADPH and thioredoxin reductase (TRXR) to catalyse the reduction of intramolecular or intermolecular protein disulphides⁶⁸,⁶⁹, whereas GRX catalyses the reduction of protein-mixed disulphides in a system coupled with GSH and GR.

Growing evidence supports a role for pathological superoxide generation in cardiac hypertrophy³⁸,⁷⁰–⁷⁴ and chamber dilation and dysfunction⁷⁵,⁷⁶. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) modulate transcriptional regulation⁷⁷ and modify proteins to influence signal transduction (FIG. 5). For example, mechanical strain of myocytes stimulates ROS activation through the post-translational activation

growth by inhibiting mTOR⁴⁶. Disinhibition occurs when the serine/threonine kinase Akt phosphorylates TSC2, a mechanism for hypertrophic signalling through the PI3K/Akt pathway (for reviews see REFS. 46,47).

mTOR and Akt hypertrophic signalling are thought to be important for physiological hypertrophy that is stimulated by exercise²⁰,⁴⁹. However, pathological hormonal stimulation by phenylephrine or endothelin 1 also activates TSC2 and de-represses mTOR through the small GTP-binding protein Ras and subsequent activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase (MEK) and extracellular response kinase (ERK)⁴⁷. mTOR is energetically regulated by 5′AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which phosphorylates and activates TSC2. Reduction in AMPK occurs in animals lacking the lipokine adiponectin⁵⁰, which exacerbates pathological hypertrophy from pressure overload⁵¹.

Rapamycin binds to the 12-kDa immunophilin FK506-binding protein, and the combined rapamycin-FKBP12 complex in turn inhibits mTOR and S6K activation (FIG. 4). Rapamycin reduces hypertrophy in neonatal myocytes⁵²,⁵³ and in hearts with modest hypertrophy stimulated by pressure overload⁵⁴,⁵⁵. In both instances, inactivation of p70S6K1 seems to be central to the response, which is intriguing as p70S6K1 activity peaks early (4 hours of banding), returning to baseline by 24 hours. Another interesting feature is that although hypertrophy is reduced, expression of fetal genes, such as

ROCK, the principal effector kinase for Rho signalling, can affect membrane ion channels, block protective signalling cascades coupled to Akt, alter sarcomeric proteins and induce gene transcriptional changes.

The likely result of this is the malrotation of the oxidase domains leading to the molecular uncoupling<sup>101,102</sup> and functional uncoupling of catalytic activity enhancing O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> or H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> formation. ROS generation by uncoupled NOS may have a role in hypertension<sup>103</sup>, heart failure<sup>104</sup> and cardiac hypertrophic remodelling and dysfunction<sup>101</sup>. Diabetic vasculopathy can be prevented by upregulating the primary synthetic enzyme for BH<sub>4</sub>, GTP-cyclohydrolase<sup>102,105</sup>. BH<sub>4</sub> is being examined as a potential treatment for hypertension and vascular disease<sup>105–107</sup>, and may have a role in inhibiting and/or reversing cardiac hypertrophy. New synthetic molecules may provide cost-effective methods to use BH<sub>4</sub> as a drug, and clinical studies are currently underway.

Small-molecule activators of intrinsic antioxidants include Tempol, a membrane-permeant SOD mimetic. However, in models such as hyperthyroid-induced or catecholamine-induced hypertrophy, in which ROS activation is clearly present in the heart, Tempol did not blunt hypertrophy<sup>108,109</sup>. Ebselen is a glutathione peroxidase mimetic that improves ischaemia reperfusion injury<sup>110</sup>, although antihypertrophic effects have not yet been reported. Antioxidants such as vitamin E suppress neonatal myocyte hypertrophy<sup>71</sup>, but in vivo data demonstrating effectiveness remain lacking. More potent antioxidants derived from red grapes and natural polyphenols such as resveratrol and its analogues (isorhapontigenin<sup>111</sup>) blunt cellular and chamber hypertrophy in conjunction with reducing mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), Akt/GSK3β, and S6K activation. However, it should be noted that broad antioxidant treatment trials (vitamins C, E and so on) in cardiovascular disease have been disappointing<sup>112</sup>. Nevertheless, the pursuit of more potent and perhaps better targeted treatments holds considerable promise.

cGMP and PKG: exploiting an intrinsic brake

Cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) and its primary effector kinase, PKG (or cGK), have important roles in acute and chronic cardiac regulation<sup>113–115</sup>. cGMP has been thought to exert a yin/yang-like balancing of cAMP-stimulated responses<sup>116–118</sup> (FIG. 6), although

Figure 5 | Reactive oxygen species (ROS) signalling in hypertrophy. ROS-generating systems are shown on the left and include xanthine oxidase, NADPH oxidases (NOX2, NOX4), nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and mitochondrial complexes. ROS activation has protein effects on calcium handling, myofilament function, matrix activation, kinase and phosphatase stimulation, and transcriptional regulation. Small-molecule interference can target specific ROS generating systems (left), or more broadly affect ROS once generated by acting as scavengers (shown on right). 5HTMF, 5-hydrotetramethylfolate; α/β-AR, α/β-adrenergic receptor; ASK1, apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (similar to MEKK5/MAP3K5); AT1R, angiotensin II type 1 receptor; BH₄, tetrahydrobiopterin; ET1R, endothelin 1 receptor (also known as EDNRA); Ets, E26 transformation-specific sequence transcription factor; LTCC, L-type calcium channel; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MMPs, metalloproteinases; NFκB, nuclear factor-κB; PKC, protein kinase C; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase; PLB, phospholamban; RyR, ryanodine receptor; SERCA2, sarcoplasmic reticular ATPase 2.

cAMP-independent signal modification also occurs. Importantly, clinical agents exist that enhance the genesis (for example, NO donors, natriuretic peptides (NPs) and nitrates) or block hydrolysis (phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitors) of cGMP. Recent studies highlight the complex regulation of the heart by cGMP/PKG interacting at multiple nodes in the hypertrophy cascade¹¹³,¹¹⁵; generally showing little influence on rest function, but a greater impact when hearts are acutely or chronically stressed, much like an automotive brake.

Myocyte cGMP is generated by membrane-receptor-coupled guanylate cyclase (GCA, also rGC) or by soluble NO-stimulated guanylate cyclase (sGC). Binding of NP (atrial NP (ANP) or brain (BNP)) to the extracellular domain of the NP receptor (NPRA) de-represses the intracellular kinase homology domain to activate GCA¹¹⁹,¹²⁰. Cardiac myocytes have both NPRA and NPRB receptors, the latter being stimulated by ANP and C-type NP (CNP)¹²¹. sGC activation principally results from NO binding to its reduced haem moiety, enhancing the conversion of GTP to cGMP. Once formed, cGMP can affect function by feedback on cAMP and stimulation of PKG.

PKG phosphorylates proteins regulating ion channels, excitation–contraction coupling (troponin I¹²², phospholamban¹²³,¹²⁶) and growth and survival signalling (for example, RhoA¹²⁵,¹²⁶) (FIG. 6). In vascular muscle, PKG stimulates MLC phosphatase (MLCP), leading to reduced myosin force generation and thus vasorelaxation. MLCP exists in myocytes, although its role in hypertrophy

is unclear. PKG also interacts with proteins such as regulator of G-coupled signalling (RGS2) through a leucine-zipper motif¹²⁷. The combined protein complex, with activated RGS2, migrates to the membrane, where it can induce the re-assembly of the Gaq complex, suppressing receptor-coupled signalling via this pathway. This may have an important role in arterial proliferation and hypertension¹²⁷, and recent studies suggest a similar role in myocyte hypertrophy¹²⁸,¹²⁹. PKG also signals to mitochondria, resulting in cytoprotection to ischaemia/reperfusion injury through a PKC-dependent pathway¹³⁰,¹³¹ and mitochondrial biogenesis¹³². This may blunt oxidant stress and stimulate energy production to meet stress demands.

Most studies showing antihypertrophic effects of cGMP/PKG *in vivo* have focused on NP/NPRA-coupled stimulation pathways. Mice that lack GCA in cardiac myocytes develop greater left-ventricular mass at rest and enhanced hypertrophy in response to stress despite a slightly lower arterial pressure¹³³. Mice that lack BNP develop fibrosis, but little left-ventricular hypertrophy¹³⁴. NP, NO and cGMP inhibit cardiomyocyte hypertrophy *in vitro*¹¹⁴,¹³⁵. NP has been clinically available since 2001, when nesiritide (Natrecor; Scios) was approved for treating decompensated heart failure. However, this synthetic peptide requires intravenous infusion, and effects on central vascular pressures and arterial pressure are sufficiently large that targeting hypertrophic growth is difficult. Recent studies have raised concerns of renal dysfunction with this therapy, which may relate

with PDE5 and PDE9 being specific for cGMP<sup>141</sup>. PDE1 and PDE2 are dual-substrate enzymes. The role of PDE1 in myocytes remains largely unknown, whereas PDE2 seems to regulate NP-generated cGMP in myocytes<sup>142</sup>, and can also hydrolyse cAMP when stimulated by cGMP to blunt contractility<sup>118</sup>. The best known cGMP-esterase is PDE5, the inhibition of which by drugs such as sildenafil (Viagra; Pfizer) (TABLE 1) is a main treatment of erectile dysfunction and more recently pulmonary hypertension<sup>143,144</sup>. PDE5 seems to be localized to z bands in cardiac myocytes, where it may regulate a localized compartment with particular activity on acute and chronic cardiac stress response<sup>145,146</sup>. Acute PDE5 inhibition inhibits β-adrenergic-stimulated contractility in mice<sup>146</sup>, dogs<sup>145</sup> and humans<sup>147</sup>, and is cardioprotective against ischaemia-reperfusion injury and apoptosis<sup>131</sup>. Chronic PDE5 inhibition prevents and can reverse cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis and contractile dysfunction induced by pressure overload<sup>148</sup>. These data have led to the initiation of a recent clinical trial to determine the efficacy of PDE5 inhibition — using the PDE5 inhibitor tadalafil (Cialis; Eli Lilly) — on hypertensive cardiac hypertrophy.

## Calcineurin

Calcineurin is a ubiquitously expressed serine/threonine phosphatase that exists as a heterodimer containing a catalytic (A) and regulatory (B) subunit. In response to abnormally increased intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin complexes bind to the B subunit, inducing a conformational change that frees the enzyme to dephosphorylate downstream substrates<sup>149</sup> — notably members of the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) transcription factor family<sup>150</sup>. On dephosphorylation, NFAT translocates to the nucleus, where it binds DNA and activates transcription by intrinsic transactivation domains and combinatorial interactions with other transcription factors, including GATA-binding protein 4 (GATA4) and myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2). Calcineurin was first reported to regulate pathological cardiac hypertrophy by Molkentin and colleagues in 1998 (REF. 151), and subsequent genetic manipulations of the calcineurin/NFAT axis have confirmed this role<sup>152–157</sup>.

Pharmacological inhibition of calcineurin effects can be achieved by suppressing calcineurin directly, or by targeting its modulating proteins or downstream effectors. Calcineurin inhibition by cyclosporine A and FK506 — both immunosuppressants that are highly specific for calcineurin when complexed with their endogenous cytosolic receptors (cyclophilin and FKBP, respectively) — was first tested for antihypertrophic properties *in vivo* in rodents. However, these compounds had equivocal effects, probably due to the pleiomorphic functions of calcineurin and the complex actions of the inhibitors<sup>158,159</sup>.

Rather than directly targeting calcineurin, efforts have turned to stimulating the expression and/or activity of endogenous calcineurin inhibitors, among which three are enriched in muscle: modulatory calcineurin-interacting protein (MCIP1; also known as DSCR1), calscarin (also known as myozenin) and atroglin, a muscle atrophy F-box protein (FIG. 7). MCIP1 blocks calcineurin by its high-affinity binding to the catalytic site<sup>160</sup>.

Figure 6 | Small-molecule regulators of the cGMP/cGK1 (PKG1) pathway. The cGMP/ cGK1 system acts like an internal brake in the cardiac myocyte to suppress stress-stimulated signalling. Much of this action is thought to be mediated by cGMP-targeted kinase (cGK1) also known as protein kinase G (PKG1), which can suppress Ga<sub>q</sub> stimulation by interaction with regulator of G-protein-coupled signalling 2 (RGS2), inhibit calcium stimulation of calcineurin and RhoA, modify sarcomeric function, and influence mitochondrial function and gene transcription. cGMP synthesis is regulated by nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and by natriuretic peptides (ANP, BNP) working through two different isoforms of soluble guanylate cyclase (rGC and sGC). Available small-molecule stimulators of this process are forms of the NPs, NO-generating compounds such as isosorbide dinitrate, and direct activators of sGC (BAY 58-2776 or BAY 41-2774). cGMP can also be increased by blocking selective phosphodiesterases (PDEs) such as PDE5a (for example, with sildenafil). α/β-AR, α/β-adrenergic receptor; AT1R, angiotensin II type 1 receptor; Cn, calcineurin; ET1R, endothelin 1 receptor (also known as EDNRA); GATA4, GATA-protein binding 4; LTCC, L-type calcium channel; MEF2, myocyte enhancer factor 2; NFAT, nuclear factor of activated T cells; NPRA/B, natriuretic peptide receptor type A/B; SRF, serum response factor.

Oral NP has been developed by alkylPEGylation, in which short monodispersed amphiphilic oligomers are covalently attached to specific sites to alter BNP hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity, protecting it from stomach digestion<sup>137</sup>. cGMP can also be increased by providing NO donors such as isosorbide dinitrate (FIG. 6), and more recently by directly stimulating sGC (for example, BAY 58-2776, and 41-2772)<sup>138,139</sup>. Novel agents for sGC activation have been developed that work in the presence of an oxidized central haem, making them more effective in pathological but not physiological environments<sup>138</sup>. They are, therefore, more potent as antihypertensives in disease models<sup>139</sup>, but their effect on hypertrophy remains to be determined.

Last, cGMP/PKG signalling can be enhanced by inhibiting cGMP hydrolysis with targeted PDE inhibitors<sup>140</sup>. In human myocytes, PDE1, 2, 3, 5 and 9 are expressed,

Transgenic overexpression of MCIP1 in the mouse heart inhibits pathological remodelling from pressure overload¹⁵⁴ and infarction¹⁵⁵, without promoting cardiac decompensation.

These results suggest that small molecules that increase cardiac MCIP1 levels will block pathological hypertrophy. A cell-based, high-throughput screen monitoring a luciferase reporter gene under the control of the *MCIP1* gene promoter identified a novel series of 4-aminopyridine-containing compounds that resemble serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT). The compounds activate MCIP1 expression by binding to and agonism of the 5-HT₂B receptor¹⁶¹. However, this compound series, referred to as pyridine activator of myocyte hypertrophy (PAMH) (FIG. 7), promoted *MCIP1* gene expression through the activation of calcineurin/NFAT signalling, stimulating rather than inhibiting hypertrophy. A modified screen for compounds that post-translationally enhance MCIP1-protein expression yielded a novel class of benzothiophenone-containing molecules that stabilize a calcineurin-independent form of MCIP1 (REF. 162) (FIG. 7). These compounds block agonist-dependent hypertrophy of cardiac myocytes in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting promise for this approach.

The net impact of MCIP1, however, may depend on its phosphorylation status. For example, phosphorylation of MCIP by GSK3β in yeast promotes calcineurin signalling¹⁶³, which is paradoxical given the ability of this kinase to inhibit calcineurin-mediated cardiac hypertrophy in mice¹⁶⁴. MEKK3, an MAPK, stimulates calcineurin in response to angiotensin II by triggering MCIP1 phosphorylation¹⁶⁵, resulting in the release of MCIP1 from the calcineurin complex.

Calsarcins are muscle-enriched calcineurin inhibitory proteins. Expression of calsarcin 1 is specific for heart and skeletal muscle, whereas calsarcin 2 and calsarcin 3 are only expressed in skeletal muscle¹⁶⁶,¹⁶⁷. In cardiomyocytes, calsarcin 1 localizes to sarcomere z-disks through the physical association with α-actinin, tethering a pool of calcineurin to the contractile apparatus. Genetic deletion of calsarcin 1 exaggerates calcineurin signalling and exacerbates pressure-overload hypertrophy¹⁶⁸, but has no effect on physiological hypertrophy caused by exercise. Compounds that stabilize calsarcin–calcineurin interactions may prove useful for inhibition of pathological cardiac hypertrophy.

A third muscle-enriched calcineurin inhibitor is atroglin¹⁶⁹, which functions as an adaptor that couples calcineurin to the SCF ubiquitin ligase complex, thereby targeting the phosphatase for degradation by the proteasome. Ectopic overexpression of atroglin in the mouse heart blunts calcineurin signalling and associated cardiac hypertrophy in response to pressure overload¹⁷⁰. The *atrogin* gene promoter is stimulated by the FOXO transcription factor¹⁷¹, and adenoviral gene transfer of FOXO to cultured cardiac myocytes¹⁷²,¹⁷³ or adult mouse hearts¹⁷³ results in atroglin-dependent blockade of calcineurin signalling and cardiac hypertrophy. A high-throughput screen identified small molecules that enhance FOXO activity by blocking its nuclear export¹⁷⁴; these compounds warrant testing in models of cardiac hypertrophy.

MCIP1, calsarcin and atroglin are non-classical drug targets for which the desired pharmacological effect is stimulatory rather than inhibitory. Nonetheless, they remain intriguing because of their enriched expression in the heart, and they suggest possibilities for small-molecule treatment of cardiac hypertrophy without side effects associated with calcineurin inhibition in other tissues (for example, immunosuppression and nephrotoxicity).

Last, calcineurin signalling may be blocked by targeting the interaction of the phosphatase with specific downstream substrates. A cell-permeable peptide inhibitor of calcineurin–NFAT interaction was recently shown to block hypertrophy in response to pressure overload in rats¹⁷⁵. Such protein–protein interactions are historically difficult to target with small molecules, yet recent high-throughput screens have uncovered compounds that block the association of calcineurin with NFAT¹⁷⁶. These newly discovered small molecules — INCAs (inhibitors of NFAT–calcineurin association) — bind covalently and non-covalently to a cysteine residue adjacent to the calcineurin docking site on NFAT¹⁷⁶,¹⁷⁷ (FIG. 7). Future studies will test if these allosteric inhibitors solely modify NFAT or also alter cysteines in other proteins.

### TRPC channels

Canonical transient receptor potential (TRPC) channels are a family of membrane-spanning, non-selective cation channels that mediate non-voltage-gated influx of Ca²⁺ in response to GPCR signalling, receptor tyrosine kinase signalling and depletion of internal Ca²⁺ stores¹⁷⁸,¹⁷⁹. Cardiac TRPC expression rises in rodent models of pathological cardiac hypertrophy and in humans with heart failure¹⁸⁰. Intriguingly, downregulation of sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca²⁺ ATPase (SERCA) pump expression, a hallmark of pathological hypertrophy that impairs Ca²⁺ reuptake into the sarcoplasmic reticulum, is associated with the upregulation of TRPC-channel expression and calcineurin activation¹⁸¹.

Pathological stimuli cause phospholipase (PLC) activation and Ca²⁺ store depletion, potentiating TRPC activity and producing a Ca²⁺ signal that activates calcineurin/NFAT signalling. Overexpression of the TRPC3 isoform in cultured cardiomyocytes promotes pathological cardiac hypertrophy by the superactivation of calcineurin signalling¹⁸⁰, whereas RNAi-mediated knockdown of endogenous TRPC3 or TRPC6 blunts agonist-dependent growth of these cells¹⁸². Transgenic overexpression of TRPC3 (REF. 183) or TRPC6 (REF. 184) in the adult mouse heart promotes pathological cardiac hypertrophy in association with exacerbated calcineurin signalling. As TRPC channels are mechanosensitive¹⁸⁵, abnormal mechanical stress in hypertrophied or failing hearts might activate them directly. Among the genes modulated by the calcineurin/NFAT pathway are TRPCs themselves¹⁸⁰,¹⁸⁴,¹⁸⁶, completing a positive feedback circuit that stabilizes a state of hypertrophic gene expression.

It remains to be determined whether existing TRPC inhibitors or future derivatives that have greater selectivity for TRPC channels will block pathological cardiac hypertrophy *in vivo*. TRPC inhibition has historically relied on the use of 2-aminoethoxydiphenylborane (2-APB)¹⁸⁷,

which also targets TRPV and TRPM channels. Recent high-throughput screens for compounds that suppress the activation of the NFAT-responsive IL2 promoter identified a new series of 3,5-bistrifluoromethyl pyrazole (BTP)

inhibitors^{188,189} (FIG. 7), which were subsequently shown to function as TRPC antagonists^{190,191}. An alternative high-throughput screen for compounds that block NFAT nuclear translocation also yielded TRPC inhibitors^{192}, suggesting an intriguing future for this approach.

## Ca²⁺/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases

Another Ca²⁺-dependent signalling mechanism that promotes pathological cardiac hypertrophy involves the CaMKs. Six distinct genes encode members of the CaMK family: CaMKI, CaMKIIα, β, γ, δ and CaMKIV, among which CaMKIIγ and CAMKIIδ are expressed at significant levels in the heart^{193}. CaMKII forms homo- and heteromeric complexes consisting of 6–12 subunits that assemble into a structure resembling a bicycle wheel with spokes. CaMKII exists in an inactive state by virtue of a 16-amino-acid autoinhibitory domain, which binds to the active site of the enzyme and sterically precludes its association with ATP and protein substrates. Ca²⁺/ calmodulin complexes bind to and dislodge the auto- inhibitory domain, permitting subsequent autophosphorylation of this domain, which locks the enzyme in an active, Ca²⁺-independent state^{194,195}.

In the late 1990s and early 2000s, studies with transgenic mice and chemical inhibitors of CaMKs started to suggest a role of CaMKs in the control of cardiac hypertrophy^{196–200}. CaMK activity was also found to be elevated in animal models of pathological hypertrophy^{199,201–205}, and in human end-stage failing hearts^{206}. CaMKIIδ is the most abundant isoform in the heart, and its mRNA transcript is alternatively spliced to produce distinct isoforms, including δ_B and δ_C, which localize to the nucleus and cytoplasm, respectively. Cardiac-specific overexpression of CaMKIIδ_B (REF. 207) or CAMKIIδ_C (REF. 208) is sufficient to trigger pathological hypertrophy and cardiac failure. Cardiac-specific, pan-CaMKII inhibition was achieved in mice through the overexpression of the autoinhibitory domain, and is well tolerated^{209}. Such mice are resistant to hypertrophy from β-AR stimulation and have reduced heart dilation and dysfunction following myocardial infarction (MI). CaMKII inhibition also blocked cardiac myocyte death in these models^{210,211}.

Downstream effectors of CaMKII include those controlling cardiac Ca²⁺ handling^{212}. For example, CaMKII phosphorylates L-type Ca²⁺ channels^{213}, increasing Ca²⁺ entry into myocytes; the ryanodine receptor (RyR)^{214}, promoting Ca²⁺ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum^{215,216}; and phospholamban (PLB)^{217}, causing derepression of the SERCA pump and enhanced Ca²⁺ uptake by the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The net effect is increased calcium release and uptake, often with a net rise in Ca²⁺ that impairs contractility^{218} and is arrhythmogenic^{219–221}. CaMKII signalling also promotes the phosphorylation of transcriptional regulators that govern expression of pro-growth genes^{222,223}.

Pharmacological inhibition of CaMKs has relied on KN62 and KN93 (TABLE 2), both isoquinoline-sulphonamides that bind to the calmodulin docking site on CaMK, thereby preventing the activation of CaMKs by Ca²⁺/ calmodulin. KN93 was shown to block post-MI cardiac

Figure 7 | Small-molecule regulators of the cardiac calcineurin axis. On dephosphorylation by Ca²⁺-dependent calcineurin, the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) transcription factor translocates to the nucleus, where it regulates pathological cardiac gene expression through interactions with other transcription factors, including myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) and GATA-binding protein 4 (GATA4). The pool of Ca²⁺ derived from TRPC (canonical transient receptor potential) ion channels contributes to calcineurin activation. Stress signals, such as those emanating from G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), trigger phospholipase C (PLC) activation and subsequent formation of diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP₃). IP₃ promotes the release of Ca²⁺ from internal stores, which potentiates TRPC channel activity. PLC is capable of activating TRPC channels by direct binding to the channel and indirectly via DAG, which also associates with TRPC channels. Endogenous inhibitors of calcineurin include modulatory calcineurin-interacting protein 1 (MCIP1; also known as DSCR1); calsarcin, which is tethered to the sarcomere; and atroglin. Small-molecule regulators of the calcineurin–NFAT pathway include pyridine activator of myocyte hypertrophy (PAMH), which stimulates calcineurin through 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) 2B (5-HT₂B) receptors; 3,5-bistrifluoromethyl pyrazole 2 (BTP-2), which inhibits TRPC channels; benzothiophene inhibitor of myocyte hypertrophy (BIMH), which blocks calcineurin signalling by stimulating expression of MCIP; and inhibitor of NFAT-calcineurin association (INCA), which binds directly to NFAT. P, phosphate.
remodelling in mice<sup>209</sup>. However, whether inhibitors that suppress the CaMKII activation step are efficacious for the treatment of chronic hypertrophy and failure, in which drugs need to block autophosphorylated Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent CaMKII to reverse disease, remains unclear. An alternative approach is the development of an ATP-competitive small-molecule inhibitor of the CaMKII catalytic domain<sup>224</sup>. Small molecules that achieve this have been identified, but are related to the general serine/threonine kinase inhibitor staurosporine and are thus promiscuous kinase inhibitors<sup>225</sup>. Development of selective, ATP-competitive inhibitors of CaMK remains in question, but may be helped by computational chemistry studies that are based on the CaMKII crystal structure<sup>226</sup>.

### Protein kinase C

Members of the PKC family of serine/threonine kinases have key roles in cardiac hypertrophy and have been recently reviewed in detail<sup>60</sup>. Classical and conventional PKCs (cPKCs) such as α, βI, βII and γ are activated by Ca<sup>2+</sup> and the lipid-derived second messenger diacylglycerol (DAG). Novel PKCs (nPKCs) δ, ε, η and θ are also activated by DAG but are Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent, whereas atypical PKCs (aPKCs) λ and ζ require neither Ca<sup>2+</sup> or DAG for activation. PKCα, β, δ and ε appear to be most abundant in adult hearts and have been most scrutinized with regard to regulation of pathological hypertrophy.

Analogous to MCIP1 for calcineurin, PKC-interacting cousin of thioredoxin (PICOT) is an endogenous inhibitor of PKC signalling<sup>227</sup> that is upregulated during cardiac hypertrophy<sup>228</sup>. Transgenic overexpression of PICOT in the mouse heart blocks pressure-overload-induced hypertrophy and improves cardiac function, suggesting that PKC inhibitors may be therapeutically useful for pathological hypertrophy<sup>228</sup>. However, the precise PKC isoform(s) targeted by PICOT to control hypertrophy remain unknown, as PICOT can inhibit multiple PKC family members.

Attempts to target PKC will probably need to selectively inhibit some but not other isoforms. Mochley-Rosen and colleagues showed that the activation of either PKCδ or PKCε was sufficient to induce hypertrophy, but this was more physiological in character<sup>229</sup>. Conversely, peptide-mediated inhibition of PKCε (REFS 230,231) and PKCδ (REF. 232) exaggerated pathological hypertrophy and promoted dilation and heart failure, supporting a role for these PKC isoforms in adaptive rather than pathological hypertrophy. *Pkcε*-knockout mice develop hypertrophy with increased collagen deposition and diastolic dysfunction<sup>233</sup>. So, PKC-directed strategies for cardiac hypertrophy should attempt to spare PKCδ and PKCε from inhibition.

Ruboxistaurin (LY333531) (TABLE 1b) is a bisindolylmaleimide PKC inhibitor that is in clinical testing for patients with retinopathy or nephropathy secondary to diabetes<sup>234,235</sup>. This compound, which seems to exhibit modest selectivity for the PKCβ isoform, was recently tested for its ability to block pathological cardiac remodelling in rats subjected to MI<sup>236</sup>. Ruboxistaurin treatment was well tolerated for up to four weeks post-MI, and was associated with a marked inhibition of cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis in the non-infarct zone of the myocardium. Although both control rats and compound-treated rats developed ventricular dilation in response to MI, cardiac performance was maintained in animals receiving the PKC inhibitor versus those treated with vehicle alone. A key question for the future is whether the beneficial effects of ruboxistaurin in the rat MI model result from selective PKCβ inhibition or targeting of other PKC isoforms and/or unrelated kinases, as related compounds can inhibit members of several kinase families *in vitro*<sup>237</sup>. It will be important to test if ruboxistaurin inhibits hypertrophy from alternative stresses such as pressure overload, as knockout studies suggest that PKCβ is dispensable for cardiac growth<sup>238</sup>.

A PKC isoform that is probably involved in pathological cardiac remodelling is PKCα. The impact of PKCα seems to be more directed towards contractility rather than hypertrophy, as PKCα activation by a peptide inducer<sup>239</sup> or transgenic overexpression<sup>240</sup> does not promote overt cardiac hypertrophy, and *Pkcα*-knockout mice develop similar hypertrophy to controls in response to pressure overload<sup>240</sup>. PKCα was shown to inhibit PLB phosphorylation by activating protein phosphatase 1, resulting in the reduced Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake by the sarcoplasmic reticulum. PLB becomes hyperphosphorylated in *Pkcα*-knockout mice, leading to de-repression of SERCA and hypercontractility. As PKCα protein levels and activity rise with heart failure<sup>241</sup>, and *PKCα* gene deletion helps rescue heart failure in *Mlp*<sup>−/−</sup> mice<sup>242</sup>, this is a promising target.

Two small-molecule bisindolylmaleimide inhibitors of PKC, Ro-32-0432 and Ro-31-8220 (TABLE 2), have been recently explored in the heart<sup>242</sup>. Both compounds acutely and chronically increased cardiac contractility in normal mice and in mice with pathological cardiac hypertrophy induced by MI, *Mlp* deletion or transgene-mediated overexpression of the Gαq protein in the heart. Although contractility improved in *Mlp*<sup>−/−</sup> mice receiving Ro-31-8220 for up to 6 weeks, hearts continued to progress to failure, in contrast to protective effects of *PKCα* deletion in this model. This discrepancy may reflect the inadequate inhibition of cardiac PKCα or negative, counterbalancing effects of Ro-31-8220 on other kinases that are cardioprotective, as it has the capacity to inhibit multiple kinases<sup>237</sup>. Nevertheless, small-molecule targeting of PKCα may provide therapeutic benefit by normalizing impaired cardiac contractility.

### Class IIa HDACs: targeting the nucleus

The most distal approach to targeting pathological cardiac hypertrophy is by modulating nuclear gene transcription<sup>243</sup>. Histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs) function as central regulators of gene transcription through their effects on chromatin structure. HATs stimulate gene transcription by acetylating nucleosomal histones, which relaxes the chromatin structure and allows DNA-binding transcription factors access to gene regulatory elements. Conversely, deacetylation of nucleosomal histones by HDACs results in transcriptional repression.

HDACs fall into three classes<sup>244</sup>: I (HDACs 1, 2, 3, 8 and 11), II (IIa: HDACs 4, 5, 7, 9; IIb: HDACs 6 and 10) and III (sirtuins), which generally seem to have pro-hypertrophic, antihypertrophic and anti-apoptotic functions in cardiomyocytes, respectively. Overexpression of class IIa HDAC5 or HDAC9 in cultured cardiomyocytes prevents hypertrophy in response to agonists, whereas disruption of the gene encoding either HDAC results in exaggerated hypertrophy in response to pressure overload and spontaneous hypertrophy with age<sup>245,246</sup>. Class IIa HDACs (FIG. 8) suppress cardiac hypertrophy through association with the MEF2 transcription factor, forming repressor complexes on regulatory elements for pro-growth genes<sup>247</sup>. Class IIa HDACs also inhibit cardiac hypertrophy by MEF2-independent mechanisms, for example, repressing NFAT-driven gene expression by interacting with an NFAT chaperone protein, mammalian relative of DnaJ (Mrj)<sup>248</sup>; by blunting serum response factor (SRF)-mediated transcription by interacting with the myocardin co-activator<sup>249</sup>; or through association with the YY1 transcription factor<sup>250</sup>. In addition, class IIa HDACs block cardiac hypertrophy through a novel association with calmodulin binding transcription activator (CAMTA), a co-activator for the NKX2–5 transcription factor<sup>251</sup>.

Cardiac hypertrophy is contingent on the nuclear export of class IIa HDACs into the cytoplasm, which de-represses pro-growth genes. This shuttling relies on the phosphorylation of two serine-containing motifs conserved in all class IIa HDACs, which induces association with a chaperone protein, 14-3-3, and unmasking of a CRM1 (also known as XPO1)-dependent nuclear export sequence<sup>252–256</sup>. Suppression of class IIa HDAC nuclear export by disruption of the phospho-acceptor sites<sup>161,223,246</sup> or with the CRM1 antagonist leptomycin B<sup>257</sup> inhibits cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. PKC can induce the nuclear export of class IIa HDACs, but it does so indirectly by activating a downstream effector kinase, PKD<sup>258</sup>. PKD directly phosphorylates class IIa HDACs and thereby de-represses downstream target genes (FIG. 8). Knockdown of PKD expression with small-interfering RNA (siRNA) blunts hypertrophy, and transgenic mice expressing constitutively active PKD in the heart develop dilated cardiomyopathy<sup>259</sup>.

Class IIa HDACs can also be regulated by CaMKII (FIG. 8). Although PKD phosphorylates all class IIa HDACs, CaMKII only targets HDAC4 by virtue of a unique docking site not conserved in other HDACs<sup>223</sup>. Interestingly, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP₃) receptors in the nuclear envelope have been shown to transduce Ca²⁺ to a nuclear pool of CaMKII that triggers the export of HDAC5 to the cytoplasm of adult rabbit cardiac myocytes<sup>222</sup>. CaMKII-mediated nuclear export of HDAC5 may occur indirectly via another HDAC kinase (for example, PKD) or through an HDAC5-associated factor.

These data suggest that small-molecule inhibitors of a HDAC kinase(s) will block cardiac hypertrophy by retaining class IIa HDACs in the nucleus. However, as described above for CaMKII, specific PKD inhibitors have yet to be identified. One heterocyclic derivative of

staurosporine, termed GO-6976, is a potent PKD inhibitor<sup>260</sup>, but also is active towards several other kinases<sup>237</sup>. Related compounds such as UCN-01, CEP-1347 and PKC412 are in clinical development for cancer, neurodegeneration and diabetic retinopathy<sup>261</sup>. PKD is expressed in many cell types beyond cardiomyocytes, and is implicated in processes as diverse as Golgi transport, proliferation and apoptosis<sup>262</sup>. Therefore, PKD inhibitors may have pleiotropic effects in tissues other than heart. Whether suppression of class IIa HDAC nuclear export will prevent cardiac disease without causing unwanted side effects awaits *in vivo* proof-of-concept testing with selective kinase inhibitors.

### HDAC inhibitors

Small-molecule inhibitors of HDAC catalytic activity, such as the hydroxamic acid trichostatin A (TSA) (TABLE 2), are potent repressors of cardiac hypertrophy. In cultured cardiac myocytes, HDAC inhibitors block cell growth and induction of pro-hypertrophic genes in response to multiple agonists<sup>263</sup>. Studies with mice demonstrated that HDAC inhibitors (Scriptaid, TSA and SK-7041; TABLE 2) block cardiac hypertrophy driven by pressure overload<sup>264,265</sup>, by stimulation of β-ARs<sup>266</sup> or by angiotensin II receptors<sup>264</sup>. HDAC-inhibitor treatment blocked fibrosis, preserved systolic performance and improved animal survival. Importantly, HDAC inhibitors were able to reverse pre-established cardiac hypertrophy<sup>264</sup>. *In vivo* delivery of HDAC inhibitors also stimulates expression of α-MHC in the heart<sup>267,268</sup>, which is predicted to enhance cardiac contractility<sup>269</sup>.

The antihypertrophic activity of HDAC inhibitors seems paradoxical given the fact that class IIa HDACs repress cardiac hypertrophy. However, class IIa HDACs are largely devoid of catalytic activity<sup>270</sup>, and instead appear to block gene expression by functioning as adaptors that couple co-repressors such as C-terminal-binding protein (CTBP) and heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) to transcription factors<sup>271,272</sup>, and prohibit the binding of HAT co-activators to these same transcription factors<sup>273,274</sup>. TSA does not inhibit class III HDACs, which are involved in cardiomyocyte survival<sup>275</sup>. Disruption of the gene encoding *Hdac2* in mice was recently shown to blunt cardiac hypertrophy in response to β-AR stimulation and pressure overload, suggesting that suppression of this class I HDAC may contribute to the antihypertrophic action of HDAC inhibitors<sup>276</sup>. Blockade of cardiac hypertrophy in *Hdac2*-targeted mice appears to involve the upregulation of the gene encoding a phosphoinositide phosphatase<sup>276,277</sup>, which results in inactivation of AKT, a pro-hypertrophic kinase that normally neutralizes the action of antihypertrophic GSK3β (REF. 276).

It is not known whether HDACs stimulate cardiomyocyte growth entirely through deacetylation of nucleosomal histones with resultant effects on gene expression, or through deacetylation of non-histone targets. A growing body of evidence suggests the existence of diverse non-histone proteins that are regulated by acetylation/deacetylation<sup>278</sup>, and thus it is likely that HDACs also play non-genomic roles in the control of cardiac growth.

REVIEW S

Other pathways
This Review has focused on a fraction of the vast array of intracellular pathways implicated in the control of pathological cardiac hypertrophy²⁷⁹. Other potential targets for treatment of cardiac hypertrophy include p38 MAP kinases — as small-molecule inhibitors of p38 have been shown to block cardiac hypertrophy and adverse remodelling in hypertensive stroke-prone rats²⁸⁰, cardiomyopathic hamsters²⁸¹, in mice subjected to MI²⁸² and in mice expressing dominant-negative 14-3-3 chaperone protein in the heart²⁸³. Inhibitors of janus kinase 2 (JAK2)²⁸⁴ and the pro-apoptotic factor, poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP)²⁸⁵, also block cardiac hypertrophy in response to pressure overload and chronic β-AR stimulation, respectively. Furthermore, in addition to the discovery of novel mediators of cardiac hypertrophy (for example, CAMTA²⁵¹), biochemical and genetic studies continue to uncover new roles for known signalling factors in the control of cardiac hypertrophy. And in some cases, such as for cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (REFS. 286,287), checkpoint kinase 2 (REFS. 288,289), Raf-1 kinase²⁹⁰,²⁹¹, and the p300 HAT²⁹²,²⁹³, existing small-molecule inhibitors may be suitable for *in vivo* proof-of-concept testing.

Translating antihypertrophic therapy to patients
The preceding discussion has sought to systematically highlight novel ways in which we may be able to suppress pathological cardiac hypertrophy. Before concluding, it is important to consider how such treatments might be clinically used. Heart failure is certainly a logical target, especially for patients with preserved ejection fraction (also known as diastolic heart failure). The prevalence of this syndrome is increasing more than is systolic heart failure²⁹⁴, and many of these patients have marked cardiac hypertrophy, which is thought to contribute significantly to symptoms²⁹⁵. This is also an important patient group, as there are virtually no evidence-based proven treatments. Patients with systolic heart failure also develop hypertrophy, and its suppression may prove to be an important clinical target. In both groups, the signalling cascades discussed here have a broader impact on the myocardium beyond left-ventricular mass reduction, and these could prove beneficial. Treatment would probably be added to existing therapy, although it could ultimately replace some, and probably continue for the life of the patient as these syndromes are complex, and it is unlikely that the targeted pathway would turn out to be the primary ‘fire’ which when ‘put out’ would result in a permanent cure. The high prevalence of systemic hypertension with cardiac hypertrophy serving as a potent risk factor¹,⁵–⁷ for subsequent heart disease suggests that these agents might also be valuable as primary prevention therapies. Proof of efficacy for this indication is undeniably a major undertaking, but the potential could be profound. We do not know if all forms of pathological hypertrophy should be prevented, and certainly efforts to remove the inciting stimulus remain central to any treatment. Last, we do not yet know if hypertrophic disease from genetic mutations can be effectively targeted by the strategies we have described. Few of the approaches have as yet been tested in models of this disease, with statins being one exception⁴¹, and efforts to suppress calcineurin in another genetic model actually triggered more hypertrophy²⁹⁶.

Conclusions
The recent major advances in the understanding of molecular signalling in hearts exposed to pathological stress has paved the way for different approaches to treating heart disease, in particular to modulate distal

Figure 8 | Repression of pathological cardiac genes by class IIa histone deacetylases.
Pathological cardiac gene expression is activated by sequence-specific DNA-binding transcription factors, including myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2), NK2 transcription factor related, locus 5 (NKX2–5), serum response factor (SRF) and nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT). Class IIa histone deacetylases (HDACs) bind directly to MEF2 and suppress expression of downstream target genes. Class IIa HDACs indirectly associate with NKX2–5, SRF and NFAT via bridging cofactors, which are calmodulin binding transcription activator (CAMTA), myocardin and Mrj (mammalian relative of Dnal), respectively. Genes under the control of class IIa HDACs are de-repressed by signals that trigger phosphorylation-dependent nuclear export of the HDACs. Gα<sub>q</sub>-coupled receptors trigger class IIa HDAC phosphorylation by activating protein kinase D (PKD). Phospholipase C (PLC) promotes PKD activation via diacyl glycerol (DAG), which stimulates protein kinase C (PKC) to phosphorylate the catalytic domain of PKD. Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP<sub>3</sub>) produced via PLC can also trigger release of intracellular Ca²⁺, with subsequent activation of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), which selectively phosphorylates HDAC4. The pathway for CaMKII activation also involves Gα<sub>s</sub>-coupled β-adrenergic receptors (β-ARs), which cause rises in intracellular Ca²⁺ through multiple mechanisms, including activation of voltage-gated Ca²⁺ channels by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and direct binding of the channels by Gα<sub>s</sub>, α-AR, α-adrenergic receptor; AT1R, angiotensin II type 1 receptor; AC, adenylate cyclase; ET1R, endothelin 1 receptor (also known as EDNRA); P, phosphate; PICOT, PKC-interacting cousin of thioredoxin.

of the cell membrane. Although much more work is
needed to develop safe and effective small molecules that
interact with some of these pathways, there are several
molecules that are ready for clinical testing, and others
looking promising in the near future. The potential
patient populations for which such therapy could be

appropriate have substantial morbidity and mortality,
reflect a major target of health-care resources and are
growing in size. If the promise of approaches described
in this article is realised, therapeutic interventions that
improve the health of heart muscle and help it better
confront pathological stimuli that otherwise trigger
progressive disease could become widespread.
