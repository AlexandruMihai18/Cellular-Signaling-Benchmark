### Abstract

Calorie-enriched diet and lack of exercise are causing a worldwide surge of obesity, insulin resistance and lipid accretion in liver (i.e. hepatic steatosis), which can lead to steatohepatitis. Steatosis and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) can also be induced by drugs such as amiodarone, tamoxifen and some antiretroviral drugs, including stavudine and zidovudine. There is accumulating evidence that mitochondrial dysfunction (more particularly respiratory chain deficiency) plays a key role in the physiopathology of NASH whatever its initial cause. In contrast, the mitochondrial β-oxidation of fatty acids can be either increased (as in insulin resistance-associated NASH) or decreased (as in drug-induced NASH). However, in both circumstances, generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by the damaged respiratory chain can be augmented. ROS generation in an environment enriched in lipids in turn induces lipid peroxidation which releases highly reactive aldehydic derivatives (e.g. malondialdehyde) that have diverse detrimental effects on hepatocytes and other hepatic cells. In hepatocytes, ROS, reactive nitrogen species and lipid peroxidation products further impair the respiratory chain, either directly or indirectly through oxidative damage to the mitochondrial genome. This consequently leads to the generation of more ROS and a vicious cycle occurs. Mitochondrial dysfunction can also lead to apoptosis or necrosis depending on the energy status of the cell. ROS and lipid peroxidation products also increase the generation of several cytokines (TNF-α, TGF-β, Fas ligand) playing a key role in cell death, inflammation and fibrosis. Recent investigations have shown that some genetic polymorphisms can significantly increase the risk of steatohepatitis and that several drugs can prevent or even reverse NASH. Interestingly, most of these drugs could exert their beneficial effects by improving directly or indirectly mitochondrial function in liver. Finding a drug, which could fully prevent oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction in NASH is a major challenge for the next decade.

1. Introduction

Numerous countries are facing an epidemic of obesity whose origin can be explained, at least in part, by a sedentary lifestyle and an abnormally high calorie intake (Kopelman, 2000). Indeed, in our developed countries our calorie ingestion was not reduced during the 20th century to fit the decreased requirement for physical activity inherent to our modern lifestyle (Ravussin, 2005). Thus, our diet is too rich in calories, in particular those coming from saturated fat and simple sugars such as sucrose and fructose (Bray et al., 2004). Hence, in numerous individuals the energy balance (i.e. the balance between calorie intake and expenditure) becomes positive and body fat mass expands (Spiegelman and Flier, 2001). Increased adiposity and obesity are not just a cosmetic problem. They also increase the risk of various diseases such as type 2 diabetes, hyperlipemia, coronary heart disease and some cancers (Kopelman, 2000).

The liver can also suffer from this state of opulence (Angulo, 2002). Indeed, a large fraction of overweight and obese people can develop hepatic steatosis (i.e. lipid accumulation in liver, mainly as triglycerides). It is currently estimated that up to 70% of obese and diabetic people could present hepatic steatosis, whereas its prevalence is between 15 and 25% in the general population (Angulo, 2002; Neuschwander-Tetri and Caldwell, 2003; Browning and Horton, 2004). It is also important to bear in mind that numerous obese children (up to 55% in some studies) could present steatosis (Angulo, 2002; Roberts, 2002).

Fortunately, pure steatosis (i.e. without the presence of other liver lesions) is a benign condition, at least in the short term, and in a majority of subjects, steatosis will not have harmful effects on liver function. However, in the long term steatosis can progress to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (hence the acronym NASH) in 10 to 20% of patients (Angulo, 2002; Neuschwander-Tetri and Caldwell, 2003). In addition to the presence of steatosis (mainly macrovacuolar steatosis with large lipid vacuoles within the cytosol of hepatocytes), NASH is characterized by necroinflammation and some fibrosis. By specific methods such as the TUNEL assay, it is also possible to detect apoptotic hepatocytes (Feldstein et al., 2003; Robin et al., in press). These different liver lesions can be responsible for mild or moderate increase (2–3N) in plasma levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase and γ-glutamyltransferase (γGT) (Angulo, 2002; Ramesh and Sanyal, 2005).

In liver, lesions are not restricted to NASH. Indeed, in some patients, NASH can progress to advanced fibrosis, cirrhosis and even hepatocellular carcinoma (Dixon et al., 2001; Ratziu et al., 2002; Ioannou et al., 2003). More worryingly, NASH and cirrhosis have been observed in obese children (Roberts, 2002; Schwimmer et al., 2003). Thus, although NASH is not by itself a severe hepatic lesion, it can evolve toward more severe and deadly liver diseases such as cirrhosis and liver cancer.

It is worth mentioning that the term NASH is employed when steatohepatitis occurs in individuals whose alcohol consumption is nil or negligible (less than 20g ethanol/day in women and less than 40g in men) (Neuschwander-Tetri and Caldwell, 2003), while the term ‘nonalcoholic fatty liver disease’ (NAFLD) is used to regroup cases of either steatosis or steatohepatitis in these patients.

primary NAFLD. We next address the mechanisms whereby mitochondrial dysfunction can increase ROS generation and lipid peroxidation and how these effects can participate to cell death, inflammation and fibrosis. Lastly, we discuss how some drugs, natural compounds and physical exercise can have beneficial effects on NAFLD, in particular by ameliorating mitochondrial function.

## 2. Normal role of hepatic mitochondria in fat and energy homeostasis

### 2.1. Hepatic fat metabolism

Hepatic free fatty acids (FFAs) can have different sources (Fig. 1). They can be taken up by the liver from the pool of plasma FFAs released by the adipose tissue. They can be generated in liver from the hydrolysis of chylomicrons coming from the intestine. Finally, they can be directly synthesized within the hepatocytes through de novo lipogenesis (Pessayre et al., 2002; Diraison et al., 2003). Depending on the nutritional/hormonal status, hepatic FFAs either enter mitochondria to undergo β-oxidation, or are esterified into triglycerides (a storage form of three FFA molecules bound to glycerol by ester bonds).

Hepatic triglycerides, in turn, either accumulate within the cytoplasm of hepatocytes as fat droplets (probably surrounded by a layer of phospholipids and proteins such as the adipose differentiation-related protein), or are secreted as very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) (Chao et al., 1986; Heid et al., 1998). Plasma VLDL particles consist in a droplet of triglycerides (and cholesterol esters) surrounded by phospholipids and a large protein termed apolipoprotein B (apo B). Apo B is cotranslationally lipidated in the endoplasmic reticulum lumen by microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) and is further lipidated in the Golgi apparatus (Tran et al., 2002). The extent of lipidation determines the fate of apo B molecules. Indeed, fully lipidated apo B molecules quickly follow vesicular flow, to be secreted in the plasma. In contrast, incompletely lipidated apo B molecules fail to completely translocate into the endoplasmic reticulum lumen and/or undergo retrotranslocation to the cytosol, to be ubiquitinated, and to be finally degraded by the proteasome (Liao et al., 1998).

### 2.2. Mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation

The entry of long-chain FFAs into mitochondria is dependent on carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT-I), an outer membrane enzyme whose activity is inhibited by malonyl-CoA (McGarry and Foster, 1980). Malonyl-CoA is formed by acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and is the first step in the synthesis of fatty acids from acetyl-CoA (McGarry and Foster, 1980). Unlike long-chain FFAs, short-chain and medium-chain FFAs freely enter mitochondria, without requiring CPT-I and other proteins involved in the carnitine shuttle (Fromenty and Pessayre, 1995).

After a carbohydrate meal, high glucose and insulin levels cause hepatic fatty acid synthesis (McGarry and Foster, 1980;

Fig. 1. Mechanisms of fat accretion in the liver during insulin resistance-associated NASH. Insulin resistance in fat-engorged adipocytes hampers the inhibitory action of insulin on hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL), thus increasing triglyceride (TG) hydrolysis and free fatty acid (FFA) release from adipose tissue. Increased plasma FFA levels is associated with higher hepatic uptake of FFA (arrow 1). Concomitantly, insulin resistance in fat-laden myocytes can increase glucose and/or insulin levels, which increase hepatic fatty acid synthesis (arrow 2) and thus TG through the up-regulation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) and carbohydrate responsive element-binding protein (ChREBP). Increased plasma FFA uptake and increased hepatic FFA synthesis cause an expansion of the hepatic TG pool responsible for steatosis. Because fat cannot accrue indefinitely within hepatocytes, a new steady state is apparently reached. Indeed, several compensatory output pathways offset increased input pathways. Compensatory pathways could include peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) activation by increased FFA and activation of mitochondrial FFA β-oxidation due to a desensitization of carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT-I) to the inhibitory effect of its endogenous inhibitor, malonyl-CoA (arrow 3). VLDL secretion involves the intrahepatic lipidation of apolipoprotein B (apo B) by microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) (arrow 4). Although apo B secretion seems to be reduced during insulin resistance, it is unclear yet whether this also affects hepatic TG secretion.

Salway, 1994). Indeed, glycolysis generates pyruvate, which is transformed by mitochondria into acetyl-CoA and then citrate, which leaves the organelle through the tricarboxylate carrier. In the cytosol, citrate regenerates acetyl-CoA, which is used for malonyl-CoA and then fatty acid synthesis catalyzed by fatty acid synthase (FAS). High malonyl-CoA levels also inhibit CPT-I and decrease fatty acid β-oxidation (McGarry and Foster, 1980). Therefore, FFAs are not degraded, but are instead directed towards the formation of triglycerides, which are secreted as VLDL (McGarry and Foster, 1980). The stimulating effect of high glucose and insulin levels on hepatic glycolysis and lipid synthesis is mainly mediated by the synergic action of two major transcription factors, namely sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c) and carbohydrate responsive element-binding protein (ChREBP) (Dentin et al., 2004; Izuka et al., 2004). Indeed, these transcription factors increase the expression of key enzymes of glycolysis such as glucokinase and L-pyruvate kinase and of lipogenesis such as ACC and FAS.

In contrast, during fasting, low insulin levels favor triglycerides hydrolysis and FFA release by adipose tissue and their subsequent hepatic β-oxidation into ketone bodies (Salway, 1994). Indeed, hepatic malonyl-CoA levels are low, allowing extensive mitochondrial import of long-chain FFAs

and thus active β-oxidation. During their β-oxidation in mitochondria, free fatty acids undergo a first dehydrogenation, then hydration, then a second dehydrogenation, and finally thiolysis, releasing one acetyl-CoA molecule and a shortened fatty acid. The cycle is repeated to split the fatty acid into several acetyl-CoA subunits. Under fasting conditions, acetyl-CoA moieties mostly condense into ketone bodies (mainly acetooacetate and β-hydroxybutyrate). Ketone bodies are secreted by the liver and are oxidized in muscles and other peripheral tissues by the tricarboxylic acid cycle (McGarry and Foster, 1980; Fromenty and Pessayre, 1995). Increased hepatic mitochondrial β-oxidation and ketogenesis partly results from the activation by long-chain FFAs of the transcription factor and nuclear receptor, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPAR-α), which increases the expression of numerous mitochondrial enzymes including CPT-I and medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (both involved in β-oxidation) and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) synthase (involved in ketogenesis) (Schoonjans et al., 1996; Kersten et al., 1999).

Beside PPAR-α activation during fasting, increased glucagon levels also play a key role in FAO stimulation. Indeed, through increased cAMP and protein kinase A (PKA) activation, glucagon activates another major transcription
factor, namely the cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB), which increases the expression of CPT-I in combination with hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (HNF4α, another transcription factor) and PPAR-γ coactivator 1 (PGC-1, a transcription coactivator) (Louet et al., 2002). Interestingly, glucagon could also activate PPAR-α through its effect on PKA, thus suggesting crosstalk between these signaling pathways. Indeed, phosphorylation of PPAR-α by PKA stabilizes the liganded nuclear receptor on DNA (Lazennec et al., 2000). Finally, fasting seems to moderately activate AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in liver (Munday et al., 1991; Gonzalez et al., 2004). AMPK plays a key role in the regulation of FAO in liver and other tissues, in particular because it phosphorylates and inactivates ACC, hence decreasing levels of malonyl-CoA, the endogenous CPT-I inhibitor (Winder and Hardie, 1999). In addition to its stimulating effect on mitochondrial FAO, AMPK activation may also shut down fatty acid and lipid synthesis by blocking SREBP-1c and ChREBP action (Foretz et al., 1998; You et al., 2004).

### 2.3. Production of energy and ROS by the respiratory chain

FFA oxidation in mitochondria and oxidative degradation of other fuels in mitochondria and elsewhere are associated with conversion of oxidized cofactors (NAD⁺ and FAD) into reduced cofactors (NADH and FADH₂) (Fromenty and Pessayre, 1995). These reduced cofactors are then re-oxidized by the mitochondrial respiratory chain, which is embedded in the mitochondrial inner membrane. This re-oxidation regenerates the NAD⁺ and FAD necessary for other cycles of fuel oxidation (Fromenty and Pessayre, 1995).

During their oxidation, NADH and FADH₂ transfer their electrons to the first complexes of the respiratory chain. Electrons then migrate along the respiratory chain, and this flow of electrons is coupled with the extrusion of protons from the mitochondrial matrix to the mitochondrial intermembrane space. This extrusion generates a large electrochemical potential across the inner membrane, thus creating a reservoir of latent, potential energy.

When energy is needed, protons re-enter the matrix through the F₀ portion of ATP synthase, causing the rotation of a molecular rotor in the F₁ portion of ATP synthase and the conversion of ADP into ATP. The adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT) then extrudes ATP from mitochondria, in exchange for cytosolic ADP (Pessayre et al., 2002). Cytoplasmic ATP is then used in the cell to power numerous reactions that require energy. The whole biochemical process, which couples the oxidation of reduced cofactors (NADH and FADH₂) to the phosphorylation of ADP into ATP, is referred to as oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS).

Most of the electrons provided to the respiratory chain migrate all the way along the respiratory chain, to finally reach cytochrome c oxidase, where they safely combine with oxygen and protons to form water (Fromenty and Pessayre, 1995; Pessayre et al., 2002). However, at several upstream sites of the respiratory chain, a fraction of these electrons can directly react with oxygen, to form the superoxide anion radical. This radical is then dismutated by mitochondrial manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) into hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂), which is detoxified into water by the mitochondrial glutathione peroxidase (Pessayre et al., 2002). The latter enzyme plays a key role in H₂O₂ detoxication since liver mitochondria do not have catalase. Importantly, glutathione peroxidase needs adequate amount of reduced glutathione (GSH) within the mitochondrial matrix in order to detoxify H₂O₂, so that the depletion of mitochondrial GSH below a critical level can lead to, or favor, mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death (Haouzi et al., 2001; Fernandez-Checa and Kaplowitz, 2005).

Thus, the respiratory chain generates ROS even in healthy mitochondria. However, in the physiological state, most mitochondrial ROS are detoxified into water, and only a small amount of residual ROS persists. It is currently unknown whether residual ROS have physiological roles, but recent data suggest that H₂O₂ is able to function as a signaling molecule, allowing communication between the mitochondria and the cytosol (Nemoto et al., 2000; Hughes et al., 2005). In contrast to healthy organelles, damaged mitochondria produce larger amounts of ROS that can alter mitochondria and other cellular components as described further on (Fig. 2).

### 2.4. Mitochondrial genome

Although nuclear DNA encodes most respiratory chain polypeptides, 13 polypeptides are encoded by mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), which also encodes the two mitochondrial ribosomal RNAs and all the mitochondrial transfer RNAs necessary for the synthesis of mtDNA-encoded polypeptides in the mitochondrial matrix.

mtDNA is a circular double-stranded molecule located in the mitochondrial matrix. Each cell contains many copies of this mitochondrial genome, as there are several mtDNA copies in a single mitochondrion and many mitochondria per cell (Fromenty and Pessayre, 1995; Schon et al., 1997). The mitochondrial genome is extremely sensitive to oxidative damage due to its proximity to the inner membrane (the main cellular source of ROS), the absence of protective histones and incomplete repair mechanisms in mitochondria (Fromenty and Pessayre, 1995; Bogenhagen, 1999). Although mitochondria possess a base excision repair (BER) system, the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway is absent, or not fully operational (Croteau et al., 1999). The BER system allows mitochondria to efficiently repair oxidized DNA bases such as 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OH-dG) and abasic sites (i.e., DNA sites lacking a purine or pyrimidine base) (Hashiguchi et al., 2004). In contrast, lack of an efficient NER system impairs the repair of bulky mtDNA adducts (Croteau et al., 1999). To get rid of such lesions, mitochondria must instead resort to nuclease-mediated degradation of heavily damaged mtDNA molecules, a process that may cause mtDNA depletion (Croteau et al., 1999; Demeilliers et al., 2002).

Fig. 2. Mechanisms of hepatic JNK activation during NASH and consequences on insulin resistance and cell survival. During NASH, activation of Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) in liver can be due to increased TNF-α, fatty acids and simple sugars such as fructose. TNF-α can activate JNK either directly (arrow 1) or indirectly through damage to the respiratory chain and increased mitochondrial ROS (arrow 2). JNK, in turn, inactivates the insulin receptor substrate (IRS), thus impairing insulin action. Within the hepatocytes, impaired insulin action could be responsible for increased fatty acid oxidation (arrow 3) and gluconeogenesis. Enhanced fatty acid oxidation is intended to counteract increased lipid synthesis, which takes place within the hepatocytes exposed to high levels of free fatty acids, carbohydrates and insulin (as depicted in Fig. 1). Augmented gluconeogenesis is responsible for increased glucose production by the liver. Finally, increased ROS production within mitochondria and JNK activation (arrow 4) could induce apoptosis during NASH.

## 3. Origins of mitochondrial dysfunction in NASH

### 3.1. Mitochondrial dysfunction in drug-induced steatohepatitis

Several drugs can induce steatosis and steatohepatitis in patients who do not drink alcohol. These drugs include the antiarrhythmic and anti-anginal molecules diethylaminoethoxyhexestrol, perhexiline and amiodarone (Fromenty and Pessayre, 1995; Berson et al., 1998; Farrell, 2002), the antiestrogen and anti-neoplastic drug tamoxifen (Cortez-Pinto et al., 1995; Farrell, 2002; Bruno et al., 2005), and some antiretroviral nucleoside analogs, such as stavudine (d4T), zidovudine (AZT) and didanosine (ddI) (Hu and French, 1997; Coglan et al., 2001; Van Huyen et al., 2003). Although these drugs initially impair mitochondrial function through quite different mechanisms, they all eventually impair mitochondrial β-oxidation, as explained further on. While mitochondrial dysfunction most probably plays a central role in the pathogenesis of drug-induced steatosis and steatohepatitis (Fromenty and Pessayre, 1995; Farrell, 2002; Pessayre et al., 2002), other mechanisms can be involved with some drugs, such as an inhibition of MTP activity (Lettéron et al., 2003) or hypertriglyceridemia (Farrell, 2002). Finally, ethanol-induced mitochondrial dysfunction is a major cause of fatty liver (Pessayre et al., 2001; Fromenty and Pessayre, 1995; Cahill et al., 2002). However, the detrimental effects of ethanol are only briefly mentioned here, since this review mainly focuses on NASH.

#### 3.1.1. Inhibition of mtDNA replication

Anti-HIV nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) such as AZT, d4T or ddI can be incorporated into the growing strand of replicating mtDNA by polymerase γ, the only DNA polymerase involved in mtDNA replication. However, these dideoxynucleoside analogs do not have a 3′-hydroxyl end on their sugar moiety. Once a single molecule of the analog has been incorporated, the DNA lacks a 3′-OH group, and polymerase γ cannot add any other nucleotide into the nascent DNA strand. This blocks mtDNA replication and can cause mtDNA depletion (Chariot et al., 1999; Gaou et al., 2001; Petit et al., 2005). In mice treated for 2 weeks with five different analogs, we found that NRTI-induced mtDNA depletion was more frequently observed in the liver than in other tissues (brain, muscles, heart and white adipose tissue) (Note et al., 2003). Along with clinical data (Fromenty and Pessayre, 1995), these results suggest that hepatic mtDNA could be a prime target of NRTI toxicity.

Severe mtDNA depletion decreases the synthesis of the 13 mtDNA-encoded polypeptides, thus impairing respiratory chain activity. This, in turn, can hamper the re-oxidation of NADH and FADH₂ into NAD⁺ and FAD, leading to the inhibition of mitochondrial β-oxidation and the tricarboxylic acid cycle which require NAD⁺ and FAD. However, recent data from our laboratory suggest that some NRTIs may decrease hepatic FAO by mechanism(s) not involving OXPHOS impairment as discussed further on.

##### 3.1.2. Oxidative damage to mtDNA

In addition to mtDNA depletion, NRTIs can induce oxidative damage to mtDNA. For instance, AZT administration to mice causes the accumulation of the oxidized base, 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OH-dG) in muscle and liver mtDNA (Hayakawa et al., 1991; de la Asunción et al., 1998). In addition, AZT administration increases the urinary excretion of
8-OH-dG in humans (de la Asuncion et al., 1998). High concentrations of d4T also enhance mtDNA 8-OH-dG in human hepatoma HepG2 cells (Velsor et al., 2004). Increased levels of 8-OH-dG suggest the presence of several other oxidative DNA lesions (Richter et al., 1988). Interestingly, unrepaired oxidative bases can be misread by DNA polymerase γ during the process of mtDNA replication, thus leading to point mutations (Pinz et al., 1995). This may explain, at least in part, the accumulation of diverse heteroplasmic mtDNA point mutations observed in the peripheral blood cells of patients treated with NRTIs (Martin et al., 2003; McComey et al., 2005).

mtDNA deletions have also been reported in several patients receiving NRTIs (Bartley et al., 2001). Interestingly, mtDNA deletions could also result from the harmful effect of oxidative stress on mtDNA. Indeed, some oxidative lesions and strand breaks in mtDNA could favor ‘slipped mispairing’ of repeated and remote sequences during replication, thus eventually leading to the loss of thousands of base pairs (Berneburg et al., 1999; Cahill et al., 2002). Thus, oxidized bases, mtDNA point mutations and deletions may all have a common origin, namely oxidative damage to mtDNA. Lastly, oxidative lesions and mtDNA mutations might explain why steatosis and lactic acidosis can occur in some patients despite unchanged mtDNA levels.

### 3.1.3. Inhibition of respiratory chain and OXPHOS impairment

Beside their effects on mtDNA abundance and sequence, some NRTIs have other metabolic and mitochondrial effects (Moyle, 2000; Gaou et al., 2001). For instance, relatively low concentrations of AZT inhibit mitochondrial respiration in the presence of ADP (Elimadi et al., 1997), possibly due to the inhibition of adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT) (Barile et al., 1997), a key OXPHOS enzyme allowing ADP entry within mitochondria in exchange for ATP. Whether other NRTIs also present such inhibitory effects on OXPHOS is currently unknown.

The cationic amphiphilic drugs amiodarone and perhexiline have dual effects on mitochondrial respiration in vitro, with a transient uncoupling effect (which increases respiration) followed by inhibition of electron transfer at the level of complexes I and II of the respiratory chain (Fromenty et al., 1990a,b). Amiodarone and perhexiline are protonated in the acidic intermembrane space to be electrophoretically transported in the mitochondrial matrix, where they release one proton in the more alkaline matrix. This entry of protons decreases the mitochondrial membrane potential, and unleashes the flow of electrons in the respiratory chain to increase respiration. However, the marked accumulation of these drugs within mitochondria subsequently inhibits the respiratory chain and β-oxidation (see below) (Fromenty et al., 1990; Deschamps et al., 1994; Berson et al., 1998). These mitochondrial effects are responsible for a marked impairment of FAO and decreased ATP formation (Fromenty et al., 1990a; Deschamps et al., 1994; Fromenty et al., 1993). Interestingly, tamoxifen is, like amiodarone, a cationic amphiphilic drug which also acts as an OXPHOS uncoupler and a respiratory chain inhibitor (Tuquet et al., 2000; Cardoso et al., 2001).

#### 3.1.4. Inhibition of mitochondrial β-oxidation

NRTI-induced mtDNA depletion and respiratory chain impairment can lead to an inhibition of mitochondrial β-oxidation of fatty acids as discussed previously. However, ongoing experiments in our laboratory suggest that some NRTIs can impair hepatic mitochondrial β-oxidation without any inhibition of the respiratory chain. Indeed, high doses of d4T in mice decreased the hepatic expression of PPAR-α and decreased FAO in vivo, as shown by decreased plasma ketone bodies and lower \[^{14}C\]CO₂ exhalation after administration of labeled palmitic acid, although the activity of complexes I and IV of the respiratory chain was unaffected in liver (Igoudjil et al., 2005). Interestingly, treatment with L-carnitine prevented all the metabolic abnormalities observed in d4T-treated mice (Igoudjil et al., 2005), though our data indicate that d4T does not decrease L-carnitine levels in liver and plasma. In contrast to d4T, AZT could interfere with L-carnitine metabolism. Indeed, it has been shown recently that AZT is a non-competitive inhibitor of L-carnitine transport in myoblastic cells (Georges et al., 2003). Interestingly, ongoing experiments in our laboratory indicate that AZT can moderately decrease L-carnitine levels in mouse liver, while other investigations suggest that AZT-induced L-carnitine depletion can also occur in muscle (Semino-Mora et al., 1994).

Amiodarone and perhexiline inhibit mitochondrial β-oxidation in vitro independently of their inhibitory effect on the mitochondrial respiratory chain (Fromenty et al., 1990a; Deschamps et al., 1994; Kaufmann et al., 2005). A possible mechanism could be the direct inhibition of key mitochondrial enzymes involved in long-chain fatty acid oxidation such as CPT-I and long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (LCAD) (Kennedy et al., 1996; Hamdan et al., 2001; Spaniol et al., 2001; Kaufmann et al., 2005). Interestingly, a recent study in mice showed that amiodarone-induced hepatic steatosis was associated to a strong activation of the hepatic mRNA expression of PPAR-α and its target FAO enzymes (McCarthy et al., 2004). The authors propose that amiodarone-induced FAO inhibition increases the hepatic levels of long-chain fatty acids, which then activate PPAR-α (McCarthy et al., 2004). This compensatory activation of PPAR-α may limit the extent of liver steatosis induced by amiodarone.

### 3.2. Mitochondrial dysfunction related to insulin resistance in NAFLD

#### 3.2.1. Insulin resistance in adipose tissue and muscle

After a meal in lean persons, increased glucose in plasma causes an efficient release of insulin by pancreatic β-cells. Insulin acts on its cognate receptor on the surface of adipocytes and myocytes to trigger the phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrates (IRS), which activate phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and Akt/protein kinase B, to eventually cause the translocation of GLUT-4 glucose transporters from intracellular storagevesicles to the plasma membrane (Shepherd and Kahn, 1999). Abundant expression of GLUT-4 transporter on the plasma membrane of myocytes and adipocytes causes efficient glucose uptake, which limits the increase in glucose and insulin.

In obese people, however, adipocytes may produce less GLUT-4 transporter (Shepherd and Kahn, 1999). More importantly, fat-engorged adipocytes and fat-laden myocytes are resistant to the signaling effects of the insulin receptor (Shepherd and Kahn, 1999). It is suggested that acyl-CoA (and/or other derivatives of FFAs) and TNF-$\alpha$ may limit the activation of IRS and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (Shepherd and Kahn, 1999; Bennett et al., 2003). The mechanism could involve the activation of Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and, hence, the serine phosphorylation and inactivation of IRS (instead of its tyrosine phosphorylation and activation) (Hirosumi et al., 2002; Bennett et al., 2003). Whatever the mechanism, insufficient translocation of GLUT 4 transporters to the plasma membrane limits glucose uptake by adipocytes and myocytes (Shepherd and Kahn, 1999). This insufficient uptake tends to increase blood glucose, thus causing a compensatory increased secretion of insulin by pancreatic $\beta$ cells (Chitturi et al., 2002a). However, this compensation can be insufficient, or secondarily fails, and overt diabetes develops. Therefore, insulin resistance in adipocytes and muscles tends to increase glucose and/or insulin levels (Fig. 1).

Finally, it is noteworthy that mitochondrial function and structure are abnormal in skeletal muscle of obese and/or diabetic patients (Pessaire and Fromenty, 2005; Lowell and Shulman, 2005). Indeed, muscle mitochondria from obese and/or diabetic individuals have lower activity of the electron transport chain, lower phosphorylation capacity, lower mtDNA content and abnormal ultrastructure (Kelley et al., 2002; Petersen et al., 2004; Ritov et al., 2005). Importantly, there is growing evidence that mitochondrial dysfunction and abnormalities play a key role in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance in muscle (Pessaire and Fromenty, 2005; Lowell and Shulman, 2005).

### 3.2.2. Insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis

Both insulin resistance and high levels of insulin play a central role in the pathogenesis of hepatic steatosis in patients with various combinations of weight excess, dyslipidemia and/or type 2 diabetes (Fig. 1). As explained previously, excessive accumulation of fat in adipocytes and muscles causes insulin resistance in these organs, and contributes to fat accretion in liver. Excess of fat in liver in turn causes insulin resistance in this organ as well (Fig. 2). Indeed, fat accumulation but also other factors such as ROS, TNF-$\alpha$ or endoplasmic reticulum stress can activate JNK in liver, thus leading to IRS inactivation (Hotamisligil, 2003; Samuel et al., 2004; Ozcan et al., 2004; Kamata et al., 2005) (Fig. 2). However, insulin resistance in liver may only affect some, but not all, insulin-sensitive metabolic pathways (Neuschwander-Tetri et al., 2003). Thus, paradoxically, some metabolic pathways (e.g. fatty acid synthesis) might be over-activated as a consequence of high insulin levels, while other pathways (e.g. FAO or gluconeogenesis) might be instead over-activated as a consequence of hepatic insulin resistance (Attie et al., 2002) (Fig. 2). Interestingly, some data suggest that hepatic insulin resistance via JNK activation could be rapidly induced by an overload of simple sugars such as fructose, and this could occur well before lipid accumulation (Wei and Pagliassotti, 2004). Thus, different events can induce insulin resistance in the context of increased calorie intake and liver steatosis. Lastly, it is important to stress that JNK activation in NASH could have deleterious consequences for hepatocyte survival (Fig. 2). Indeed, JNK activation is involved in hepatic apoptosis through mechanisms that are still unclear but which could be upstream of mitochondria (Ding and Yin, 2004). In particular, JNK induces the cleavage of the BH3 interacting domain death agonist Bid into the cleavage product tBid, which undergoes a translocation to the mitochondria and releases the proapoptotic Smac/Diablo protein (Deng et al., 2003).

#### 3.2.3. Mechanisms for hepatic steatosis

Although the mechanisms responsible for fatty liver in primary NASH are still not fully elucidated, increased delivery of FFAs to the liver and augmented hepatic fatty acid synthesis most probably play a key role (Fig. 1). In addition, decreased hepatic apo B secretion has been observed in NASH, although it is not clear whether hepatic triglyceride secretion is increased, or can be sometimes decreased, in these patients (Fig. 1).

Increased fatty acid delivery to the liver participates in the development of steatosis in patients with type 2 diabetes (Figs. 1 and 2). Normally, insulin blocks adipose tissue lipolysis due to the inhibition of hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) (Salway, 1994). HSL hydrolyzes triacylglycerol into two molecules of fatty acids and monoacylglycerol, which is then hydrolyzed by another lipase to glycerol and one fatty acid (Salway, 1994). Normally, adipocytes of lean insulin-sensitive people store fat after meals and then release fatty acids during fasting. In contrast, the fat-engorged insulin-resistant adipocytes of obese persons keep releasing large amounts of glycerol and fatty acids in the circulation, a situation that normally occurs only during fasting (Gorden, 1960). Because fatty acids are readily taken up by the hepatocytes, insulin resistance greatly increases the amount of fatty acids delivered to the liver.

FFAs are not only taken up in excess from the plasma, but they are also synthesized more actively in liver (Fig. 1). Indeed, increased levels of insulin and glucose enhance fatty acid and triacylglycerol synthesis. Insulin increases levels of SREBP-1c and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor $\gamma$ (PPAR $\gamma$), two transcriptional factors which activate the expression of key enzymes involved in lipogenesis (Shimomura et al., 1999; Matsusue et al., 2003). Indeed, SREBP-1c and PPAR $\gamma$ increase the expression of citrate lyase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and fatty acid synthase (FAS), which are all involved in fatty acid synthesis. In addition, these transcription factors enhance the expression of glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (GPAT) and stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1) which promote triacylglycerol formation and deposition (Shimomura et al., 1999). Studies in genetically obese
ob/ob mice have shown a 4-fold increase in the amount of transcriptionally active SREBP-1c and a 6-fold increase in de novo fatty acid synthesis in liver, thus suggesting that enhanced lipogenesis is a key event leading to massive steatosis in these mice (Shimomura et al., 1999). Lastly, increased glucose levels can activate ChREBP, a transcription factor activating the expression of key enzymes of glycolysis and lipogenesis, as mentioned previously (Dentin et al., 2004; Lizuka et al., 2004).

NASH is also characterized, at least in some individuals, by decreased egress of apo B from the liver (Fig. 1). Indeed, recent evidence suggests that hepatic apolipoprotein B secretion into the plasma can be disturbed in primary NASH (Charlton et al., 2002; Musso et al., 2003). Interestingly, reduced hepatic apo B mRNA has been documented in several patients with NASH (Sreekumar et al., 2003), suggesting that lower apo B synthesis in NASH could be due, at least in part, to decreased transcription and/or decreased apo B mRNA stability. It is conceivable that hyperinsulinemia could play a role, as insulin lowers apo B synthesis and stability (Taghibiglou et al., 2000; Charlton et al., 2002). Importantly, decreased hepatic apo B synthesis and/or secretion in NASH can be associated with either reduced or increased plasma apo B concentration and high levels of plasma triglycerides (Charlton et al., 2002; Musso et al., 2003). Thus, lipoprotein metabolism is affected in a complex manner in liver but also in extra-hepatic tissues.

Polymorphisms or mutations affecting either apo B or MTP could increase the risk of NASH (Fromenty et al., 2004). Lastly, MTP activity can be impaired by the hepatitis C virus core protein (Perlemuter et al., 2002), some drugs (Lettéron et al., 2003) and ethanol (Lin et al., 1997; Sugimoto et al., 2002). This effect may further favor hepatic lipid deposition in insulin-resistant patients with these added causes of steatosis.

### 3.2.4. Compensatory increase in mitochondrial β-oxidation and ketogenesis

In patients with primary NASH, the liver is laden with fat, but this organ does not enlarge indefinitely. Obviously, a new steady state must be achieved. Indeed, increased hepatic uptake and synthesis of FFAs are now compensated by a faster removal of fatty acids. Apparently, this occurs in patients with NASH via increased mitochondrial β-oxidation of fatty acids and ketogenesis (Sanyal et al., 2001; Chalasani et al., 2003) (Figs. 1 and 2). Enhanced mitochondrial β-oxidation is also found in liver of genetically obese-diabetic (ob/ob) mice that present massive steatosis (Brady et al., 1985; Li et al., 2003).

The mechanisms responsible for increased mitochondrial β-oxidation in insulin resistance-associated NASH are poorly understood but several hypotheses can be put forward.

A first mechanism may be the larger pool of FFAs, due to increased hepatic uptake and synthesis of FFA in liver.

A second mechanism could be an activation of hepatic PPAR-α by the augmented pool of FFAs (Fig. 1). Indeed, hepatic PPAR-α expression is increased in three different genetic models of obesity and massive steatosis including ob/ob and db/db mice (Memon et al., 2000). Interestingly, recent data suggest that hepatic PPAR-α could be activated preferentially by fatty acids synthesized in liver from carbohydrates (the so-called ‘new fat’) but not by fatty acids released by adipose tissue (Chakravarthy et al., 2005). Thus, increased PPAR-α expression in the context of massive steatosis could be linked, at least in part, to increased de novo fatty acid synthesis in the liver. However, this basal increase in PPAR-α expression is probably insufficient to remove the excess of lipids. Indeed, as mentioned below, PPAR-α activators such as fibrates reduce liver triglycerides in several rodent models of steatosis and NASH linked to obesity and insulin resistance, including ob/ob mice (Chou et al., 2002; Nagai et al., 2002; Ip et al., 2004; Carmona et al., 2005). It is also worth mentioning that in NASH some factors could counteract FFA-induced PPAR-α up-regulation. In particular, TNF-α, NF-κB and ROS could be able to decrease PPAR-α expression, including in liver (Beier et al., 1997; Cabrero et al., 2002; Glosli et al., 2005). These observations may also explain why PPAR-α expression decreases during aging and why the hypolipidemic effect of fibrates seems to wane in old animals (Iemitsu et al., 2002; Sanguino et al., 2004). Lastly, PPAR-α activation may explain the proliferation and enlargement of hepatic peroxisomes observed in patients with fatty liver (Collins et al., 1989; De Craemer et al., 1995).

A third mechanism may be enhanced CPT-I activity, thus further increasing the entry of long-chain fatty acids into mitochondria (Fig. 1). Indeed, CPT-I (and probably CPT-II) expression and/or activity in liver are enhanced in rodent models of steatosis and type 1 or type 2 diabetes (Brady et al., 1985; Riu et al., 1996; Lee et al., 2001; Paterson et al., 2004). Increased CPT-I expression and activity can be due to PPAR-α activation, as mentioned above, but some studies also suggest that long-chain fatty acids are able to increase CPT-I expression in a PPARα-independent manner (Louet et al., 2001). PPAR-α activation in fatty liver could enhance not only the expression and activity of CPT-I but also that of the uncoupling protein-2 (UCP-2), since both proteins are PPAR-α targets (Kersten et al., 1999; Nakatani et al., 2002). Another important mechanism leading to enhanced CPT-I activity could be a decreased affinity of CPT-I for its physiological inhibitor, malonyl-CoA (Cook and Gamble, 1987). The loss of CPT-I inhibition by malonyl-CoA may explain why β-oxidation is increased in type 2 diabetic states, despite high insulin and malonyl-CoA levels. Apart from data on CPT-I, however, little is known about other enzymes involved in β-oxidation and ketogenesis in NASH. It is possible that synthesis of acetoacetate from acetyl-CoA by the mitochondrial HMG-CoA synthase (i.e. ketogenesis per se) may be increased in NASH (Serra et al., 1993), although direct evidence is lacking.

A fourth mechanism could be an activation of hepatic FAO by leptin possibly through AMPK and PPAR-α activation (Lee et al., 2002; Savage and O’Rahilly, 2002). Increased plasma levels of leptin are common in obese people (Friedman and Halaas, 1998) and in patients with NASH (Uygun et al., 2000; Chitturi et al., 2002b). Enhanced leptin expression by the expanded adipose tissue could be an adaptive response in an attempt to reduce lipid accretion in tissues such as liver, heart and skeletal muscle (Friedman and Halaas, 1998; Lee et al.,

2001; Unger, 2005). However, although this hypothesis is attractive, increased plasma levels of leptin could also reflect a state of leptin resistance not only at the central level (i.e. within the hypothalamus) but also in some peripheral tissues such as muscle and liver (Friedman and Halaas, 1998; Steinberg and Dyck, 2000; Chitturi et al., 2002b). So it still unclear whether the steatotic liver benefits from the increased expression of leptin during obesity and NASH.

A last mechanism allowing increased mitochondrial β-oxidation rates may involve several adaptations allowing sufficient re-oxidation of reduced co-factors despite the dysfunctional respiratory chain. As discussed further on, the respiratory chain seems deficient in NASH, at least in some patients. Severe impairment of the respiratory chain can hamper the re-oxidation of NADH and FADH₂ into NAD⁺ and FAD, respectively. The mitochondrial β-oxidation and the tricarboxylic acid cycle rely on several dehydrogenases, whose activity requires the presence of NAD⁺ and FAD. Therefore, severe impairment of the respiratory chain can secondarily inhibit FAO (Fromenty et al., 1990a; Fromenty and Pessayre, 1995). Thus, it may seem paradoxical that the respiratory chain and OXPHOS are dysfunctional in NASH and yet, that FAO is augmented. Although the reasons for this apparent paradox are unknown, several hypotheses can be put forward. Firstly, impairment of the respiratory chain may be mild enough to maintain a pool of oxidized factors allowing adequate FAO. Secondly, because ketone body production is increased in NASH (Sanyal et al., 2001; Chalasani et al., 2003), significant NADH re-oxidation into NAD⁺ could occur during the reduction of acetoacetate into β-hydroxybutyrate by D-β-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase. Indeed, it has been shown in our laboratory that the inhibition of FAO caused by rotenone (a specific and potent inhibitor of complex I of the respiratory chain) in isolated mouse liver mitochondria (Fromenty et al., 1990a) and in cultured rat hepatocytes (unpublished data) can be relieved by addition of acetoacetate, which consumes NADH and thus regenerates the NAD⁺ required for β-oxidation. It is noteworthy that insulin and hyperlipidemic states enhance D-β-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase expression and activity in rat liver (Kante et al., 1990). Accordingly, increased conversion of acetoacetate to β-hydroxybutyrate in NASH could be one mechanism sustaining FAO despite the dysfunctional respiratory chain. Finally, increased expression of UCP-2 may favor the oxidation of NADH and FADH₂ into NAD⁺ and FAD, as discussed in the next paragraph.

### 3.2.5. Increased hepatic expression of UCP2 in animal models of NAFLD

Increased hepatic expression of UCP2 has been reported in genetically obese ob/ob mice (Chavin et al., 1999). UCPs are mitochondrial inner-membrane proteins, whose main function is to mediate proton leak across the inner membrane and to uncouple substrate oxidation from ATP synthesis. Thus, increased expression of liver UCP2 in NASH may compromise ATP synthesis and increase the vulnerability of the fatty liver to some types of injury (Cortez-Pinto et al., 1999). On the other hand, by increasing respiration, UCP2 may augment the re-oxidation of NADH into NAD⁺, which is required for both β-oxidation and the tricarboxylic acid cycle (Fleury and Sanchis, 1999; Himms-Hagen and Harper, 2001). Accordingly, enhanced UCP2 expression may be a way to stimulate FAO in liver and limit steatosis (Himms-Hagen and Harper, 2001). Another beneficial effect of UCP2 might be to unleash the flow of electrons in the respiratory chain, thereby preventing the over-reduction of respiratory complexes and excessive mitochondrial ROS formation (Ježek, 2002). Thus, increased expression of UCP2 could have both detrimental and beneficial effects in fatty liver. Possibly due to these mitigated effects, lack of UCP2 expression in the liver of ob/ob mice does not significantly affect the severity of fatty liver disease in these animals (Baffy et al., 2002).

### 3.2.6. Mitochondrial dysfunction in patients with NAFLD

Obese or diabetic patients with severe hepatic steatosis have reduced exhalation of [¹³C]CO₂ after ¹³C-methionine administration, compared to healthy subjects (Spahr et al., 2003). Mitochondrial degradation of methionine involves both decarboxylation and dehydrogenation steps, which generate reducing equivalents that feed the respiratory chain (Quash et al., 2003). Although it is unclear which of these reactions are impaired in patients with NAFLD, this study suggests that mitochondrial function can be impaired in patients with severe steatosis, but without steatohepatitis.

In patients with NASH, liver mitochondria present ultrastructural abnormalities, with para-cristalline inclusions in megamitochondria (Sanyal et al., 2001; Caldwell et al., 1999). Although it is not known what are the biochemical changes triggering these morphological lesions, these observations again suggest mitochondrial damage.

Indeed, a short report indicates that mtDNA is severely depleted in patients with NASH (Haque et al., 2002). In other conditions, profound mtDNA depletion can severely affect mitochondrial function (Fromenty and Pessayre, 1995; Demeilliers et al., 2002) and induce steatosis and other liver lesions (Brinkman et al., 1998; Ducluzeau et al., 1999; 2002). Interestingly, decreased expression of several mtDNA-encoded polypeptides (Haque et al., 2002; Santamaria et al., 2003) and lower activity of complexes I, III, IV and V (Pérez-Carreras et al., 2003) have been found in patients with NASH, thus suggesting that mtDNA depletion could play a role in mitochondrial dysfunction. However, the activity of complex II (that does not include mtDNA-encoded polypeptides) was also decreased in NASH (Pérez-Carreras et al., 2003), thus indicating that other mechanisms, such as oxidative stress, can directly damage respiratory chain polypeptides and impair the activity of respiratory complexes (Schulze-Osthoff et al., 1992). Oxidative stress in type 1 and 2 diabetes could be due to several concomitant factors, including glucose autoxidation, glycation and inhibition of some antioxidant enzymes, and, lastly, mitochondrial dysfunction (West, 2000; Turko et al., 2003). Regarding glucose, a recent study strongly suggests that hyperglycemia could be a primary cause of respiratory chain dysfunction in liver, most probably via oxidative stress (Vanhorebeek et al., 2005). This implies that a good control

of glycemia in diabetic patients could be a mean to preserve mitochondrial function in liver (Vanhorebeek et al., 2005).

### 3.2.7. Mitochondria as a source of ROS in NASH

There is now some evidence that liver mitochondria can be a significant source of ROS in NASH. Although different studies point to the damaged respiratory chain as a main source of mitochondrial ROS in NASH (Fig. 2), recent data suggest that ectopic expression of cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) in mitochondria could also play a role in ROS overproduction.

#### ROS overproduction by the damaged respiratory chain.
As mentioned in the previous sections, impairment of the respiratory chain appears to be a common feature in both drug-induced NASH and primary NASH, although this is associated with decreased FAO in drug-induced NASH, but compensatory increased FAO in insulin resistance-associated NASH. Several studies have consistently found that hampering electron transfer within the respiratory chain causes over-reduction of some respiratory chain components, which then react abnormally with oxygen to form the superoxide anion radical, thus increasing mitochondrial ROS formation (Hassanein, 2004; Pessayre and Fromenty, 2005) (Fig. 3). In particular, both complexes I and III of the respiratory chain generate ROS (Young et al., 2002; Kushnareva et al., 2002; Nohl et al., 2005). For instance, cytochrome c-depleted mitochondria incubated with substrates generating NADH (e.g., glutamate and malate, that give their electrons to complex I) produce three times as much hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) at the level of complex I as control mitochondria (Kushnareva et al., 2002). Accordingly, in primary NASH, the concomitant increase in β-oxidation flux (which enhances NADH generation and thus electron delivery to the respiratory chain) and respiratory chain impairment (which partially blocks electron flow within the respiratory chain) are likely to produce large amounts of ROS (Fig. 3). Interestingly, β-oxidation of fatty acid per se (Yamagishi et al., 2001; St-Pierre et al., 2002) or glucose oxidation per se (Du et al., 2000) can lead to significant mitochondrial ROS generation, probably by increasing the amount of reducing equivalents and electron transfer within the respiratory chain. Augmented generation of mitochondrial ROS has been reported in genetically obese-diabetic ob/ob mice (Yang et al., 2000), though the precise site of ROS production has not been determined in these investigations. Finally, enhanced mitochondrial ROS formation has been also shown in rats fed a choline-deficient diet (Hensley et al., 2000), a rodent model of steatosis and steatohepatitis (Koteish and Diehl, 2001; Rao et al., 2002).

#### Possible involvement of mitochondrial CYP2E1.
Several investigations have reported increased hepatic expression and/or activity of cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) in obese persons (O'Shea et al., 1994), in obese type 2 diabetics (Wang et al., 2003) and in patients with NASH (Weltman et al., 1998;

![Figure 3](https://i.imgur.com/yourimageurl.png)

Fig. 3. Electron overproduction, TNF-α, reactive oxygen species (ROS), lipid peroxidation and impairment of electron transfer in the respiratory chain (RC). In normal liver mitochondria, the electrons given to the RC are flowing along this chain, up to complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase), where they safely combine with oxygen and protons (not shown) to form water. However, in the fatty liver of insulin-resistant patients, high β-oxidation rates increase electron delivery to the RC (arrow 1). The fat-engorged adipocytes of obese persons release large amounts of TNF-α, which acts on its hepatocyte receptor to permeabilize mitochondria, and partially release cytochrome c from the mitochondrial intermembrane space (arrow 2). The imbalance between a high input and a restricted flow of electrons may cause over-reduction of complexes I and III of the RC. These overly reduced complexes may react with oxygen to form ROS (arrow 3). Indeed, reduction of oxygen at complexes I and III generates the superoxide anion radical, which is dismutated into hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) by MnSOD. Then, ROS oxidize unsaturated fatty acids deposited in liver to trigger lipid peroxidation. ROS, reactive nitrogen species and reactive (aldehydic) lipid peroxidation products can directly damage mtDNA (arrows 4). Damages to mtDNA, which can be qualitative (oxidized bases, abasic sites...) and/or quantitative (depletion) can in turn decrease the synthesis of RC polypeptides (arrow 5). RC polypeptides can be also directly damaged by ROS (arrow 6), reactive nitrogen species and lipid peroxidation products. This further impairs electron transfer along the respiratory chain, and further increases mitochondrial ROS production, thus generating a vicious cycle.

Chalasani et al., 2003). The mechanism whereby CYP2E1 is increased in patients with obesity, diabetes and NASH is still unclear, although a possible common mechanism could be insulin resistance (Moncion et al., 2002) and increased hepatic ketogenesis. Indeed, ketone bodies and in particular acetone are CYP2E1 inducers (Gonzalez, 2005). Importantly, increased CYP2E1 could be an important source of ROS in hepatocytes (Chitturi and Farrell, 2001; Schattenberg et al., 2005), not only in the cytosol but also within mitochondria. Indeed, in addition to its localization in the endoplasmic reticulum, CYP2E1 is also found in significant amounts within mitochondria (Robin et al., 2001; 2002). Mitochondrial CYP2E1 can produce ROS and induce lipid peroxidation (Raza et al., 2004). Mitochondrial CYP2E1 protein and activity are increased in liver and other tissues of streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats (Raza et al., 2004). Taken together, these data suggest that mitochondrial expression of CYP2E1 could play a role in mitochondrial ROS generation.

### 3.3. Potentiating effects of aging and ethanol consumption on mitochondrial dysfunction

Although NASH can affect individuals of any age, including children (Roberts, 2002), old age could increase the risk of NASH (Chitturi and Farrell, 2001; Falck-Ytter et al., 2001). Aging is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and decreased mitochondrial antioxidant defenses in the liver. Indeed, hepatic mitochondria of old individuals present oxidative damages to the mitochondrial genome, proteins and lipids (including cardiolipin, a phospholipid that plays a key role in OXPHOS), thus leading to an impairment of both electron flow in the respiratory chain and ATP synthesis (Hagen et al., 1997; Müller-Höcker et al., 1997; Crott et al., 2005). Moreover, aging could be associated with lower hepatic expression of some enzymes involved in FAO such as the mitochondrial trifunctional protein (Mori et al., 1988; Ibdah et al., 2005). Aged hepatic mitochondria also present a marked increase in the GSSG/GSH ratio that is correlated with the accumulation of oxidized bases within the mitochondrial genome (de la Asuncion et al., 1996). Accordingly, aging-related mitochondrial dysfunction and ROS overproduction might further exacerbate mitochondrial abnormalities in NASH.

Ethanol consumption (over 20 and 40 g/d, respectively, in women and men) increases the risk of steatosis and steatohepatitis in obese individuals (Diehl, 1999; Bellentani et al., 2000). Ethanol intoxication increases ROS generation and lipid peroxidation and induces oxidative damage to mitochondrial components, including mtDNA, proteins and lipids (Fromenty and Pessayre, 1995; Fromenty et al., 1995; Mansouri et al., 1999; Suh et al., 2004). This led us to propose that alcohol can induce premature oxidative ageing of liver mitochondria (Mansouri et al., 1997). Thus, like aging, ethanol-induced ROS generation and mitochondrial dysfunction may aggravate the hepatic mitochondrial abnormalities of primary NASH. Several reviews on ethanol-induced mitochondrial dysfunction have been published recently (Cahill

et al., 2002; Hoek et al., 2002). Lastly, it is worth mentioning that repeated ethanol intoxication induces hepatic apoptosis in ob/ob mice (but not in the lean littermates) through a mechanism involving increased TNF-α production (Robin et al., in press).

### 3.4. Genetic susceptibilities able to favor mitochondrial dysfunction in NASH

For the same amount of weight excess, or for the same degree of insulin resistance, some subjects have just steatosis, while others develop steatohepatitis and cirrhosis. Genetic susceptibilities could explain, at least in some patients, a faster progression of the liver disease (Fromenty et al., 2004). In particular, some of these genetic susceptibilities could favor mitochondrial dysfunction and thus may have a significant role in steatosis and NASH.

#### TNF-α promoter

Regarding TNF-α promoter polymorphism, one allele (the so-called TNFA allele) could increase the risk of insulin resistance and NAFLD, most probably by increasing the release of TNF-α by Kupffer cells (Valenti et al., 2002). TNF-α can disturb insulin signaling in different tissues (Uysal et al., 1997) and increase fatty acid synthesis in liver (Feingold and Grunfeld, 1987). Interestingly, TNF-α is also able to downregulate PPAR-α expression in liver, and this could reduce mitochondrial FAO (Beier et al., 1997; Glosli et al., 2005). Moreover, TNF-α induces mtDNA oxidative damage (Li et al., 2001; Nagakawa et al., 2005) and mtDNA depletion in cardiac myocytes and liver (Suematsu et al., 2003; Suliman et al., 2005). This could explain, at least in part, the mtDNA depletion observed in some patients with NASH (see above). Lastly, beside increased TNF-α expression, NASH could be associated, at least in some individuals, with increased mRNA levels of the p55 TNF-α receptor 1 (Crespo et al., 2001).

#### Leptin

Leptin, an adipokine (or adipocytokine) mainly expressed in adipose tissue, plays a central role in the control of food intake and energy expenditure (Friedman and Halaas, 1998; Guerre-Millo, 2004). Interestingly, leptin favors mitochondrial oxidation of fatty acids in different tissues including liver (Yamagishi et al., 2001; Lee et al., 2002; Steinberg et al., 2002; Toyoshima et al., 2005). Total leptin deficiency due to missense leptin (ob) gene mutation leads to morbid obesity and massive steatosis but is extremely rare in human (Lin et al., 2000; Licinio et al., 2004). In contrast, a larger number of individuals could have low (but not nil) levels of leptin as the consequence of a heterozygous mutation within the ob gene (partial leptin deficiency) (Farooqi et al., 2001) or a polymorphism in the 5′ untranslated region of the ob gene (Hager et al., 1998). Interestingly, inherited low levels of leptin greatly increase the risk of fatness and obesity in human (Ravussin et al., 1997; Hager et al., 1998; Farooqi et al., 2001) and mice (Chung et al., 1998).

Because partial leptin deficiency favors increased adiposity, we recently hypothesized that it could also predispose to hepatic dysfunction in particular in a context of high-calorie feeding. Ongoing experiments show that young

C57BL-ob/+ mice (harboring only one allele of the ob gene) tend to have higher liver triglycerides (+70%) and higher plasma levels of ALT (+91%) and LDH (+56%) when compared to wild-type mice (C57BL-+/+) after 4 months on a normal diet. Moreover, our results showed that when +/+ and ob/+ mice were fed with a hypercaloric diet, liver triglycerides and plasma ALT and LDH levels were further increased when compared to mice fed with a normal diet. Overall, there was a 3-fold increase in hepatic triglycerides and plasma levels of ALT and LDH were enhanced respectively by 106 and 83% in ob/+ fed with the hypercaloric diet when compared to +/+ mice fed with a normal diet. Thus, our investigations suggest that partial leptin deficiency on one hand, and a hypercaloric diet on the other hand, can independently have harmful effects on the liver and that such deleterious effects could be additive (Begriche et al., 2005). As plasma leptin can be low also in human, it is tempting to speculate that leptin insufficiency could not only increase the risk of body fatness (Ravussin et al., 1997; Hager et al., 1998; Farooqi et al., 2001) but also that of NASH.

Other polymorphisms. Finally, as some polymorphisms favor mitochondrial dysfunction and increase the risk of alcoholic liver diseases including steatohepatitis and cirrhosis, it is conceivable that the same polymorphisms could also favor NASH. These polymorphisms include a dimorphism in the

mitochondrial targeting sequence of MnSOD (Degoul et al., 2001; Sutton et al., 2003; Nahon et al., 2005).

### 4. Consequences of mitochondrial dysfunction in NAFLD.

#### 4.1. Harmful effects of fat and ROS in liver

Although the reasons for the deleterious effects of steatosis are still incompletely understood, there is growing evidence that, in the presence of oxidizable fat in the liver, ROS can trigger lipid peroxidation which generates several reactive aldehydes (Figs. 3 and 4). ROS and reactive aldehydes, in turn, further impair mitochondrial function, to further increase mitochondrial ROS. A ROS-dependent vicious circle may thus ensue (Fig. 3).

**Lipid peroxidation.** Even in the basal state, hepatocytes produce ROS. These ROS are formed mainly in mitochondria, but also at other sites, including microsomal CYP. Yet, another potential source of ROS in liver is the NADPH oxidase of Kupffer cells (Kono et al., 2000). In NASH, more ROS are generated in liver by the mitochondrial respiratory chain and CYP2E1, as previously mentioned. Moreover, increased expression of the CD14 endotoxin receptors on Kupffer cells is documented in animals with either obesity-mediated or alcohol-mediated hepatic steatosis (Fiorini et al., 2002;

![Diagram](attachment:diagram.png)

Fig. 4. Relationship between reactive oxygen species (ROS) overproduction, lipid peroxidation and the development of liver lesions in NASH. Increased ROS generation (in particular by the damaged respiratory chain) in a cell engorged with fat enhances lipid peroxidation. This reaction generates chemically reactive, and biologically active, lipid peroxidation products, such as 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE) and malondialdehyde (MDA). ROS overproduction also increases the expression of several cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), Fas ligand (FasL) and interleukin-8 (IL-8). Lipid peroxidation products and cytokines are involved in the development of different liver lesions via different mechanisms. TNF-α and FasL bind to their cognate receptors, to induce mitochondrial membrane permeabilization (arrow 1). This induces cytochrome c release from the mitochondrial intermembrane space to the cytosol thus activating caspases. Cell death then occurs by apoptosis or necrosis depending on cell ATP levels. TGF-β, IL-8 and HNE are chemoattractants for human neutrophils (arrow 2), which may account, at least in part, for neutrophil infiltration and inflammation. TGF-β, HNE and MDA can activate hepatic stellate cells into collagen-producing myofibroblastic cells (arrow 3), thus favoring fibrosis. Leptin, whose levels are increased in obese individuals and in NASH, could be protective against steatosis (as discussed in the text). However, hyperleptinemia could also have deleterious effects on liver by increasing ROS production and by favoring stellate cell activation (arrow 4).

Enomoto et al., 2002). Increased sensitivity of Kupffer cells to bacterial endotoxin may thus increase ROS formation by these cells. This abundant formation of endogenous (i.e. inside the hepatocyte) and exogenous ROS may start to oxidize the unsaturated lipids deposited within the hepatocytes to cause extensive lipid peroxidation (Pessayre et al., 2002).

Indeed, eleven different treatments causing acute or chronic steatosis in mice consistently increased hepatic thiobarbituric acid reactants (TBARs, that represent end-products of lipid peroxidation) and ethane exhalation, an in vivo index of lipid peroxidation (Lettéron et al., 1996). After a single dose of tetracycline or ethanol, there was a parallel time course in the rise and fall of hepatic triglycerides, and the rise and fall of lipid peroxidation products, suggesting a cause-and-effect relationship between the presence of oxidizable fat in liver and peroxidation (Lettéron et al., 1996). Lipid peroxidation also occurs in animals with hepatic steatosis due to a choline/methionine-deficient diet (Leclercq et al., 2001) and in patients with NASH (Sanyal et al., 2001). Extensive lipid peroxidation releases several reactive aldehydes that can damage mitochondria (Fig. 3).

**Lipid peroxidation-induced mitochondrial dysfunction.** The peroxidation of hepatic triglycerides releases reactive aldehydes, such as 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) and malondialdehyde (MDA) which can damage several key mitochondrial components. Firstly, lipid peroxidation products can damage the mitochondrial genome (Hruszkewycz, 1988; Hruszkewycz and Bergtold, 1990; Demeilliers et al., 2002). Because mtDNA encodes 13 of the respiratory chain polypeptides, mtDNA damage can secondarily impair electron transfer in the respiratory chain, as indicated previously. Secondly, lipid peroxidation products, including 4-HNE and MDA, also directly attack and inactivate respiratory chain components, including cytochrome c oxidase, the terminal oxidase of the respiratory chain (Chen et al., 1998; 2000). This effect can also hamper electron flow in the respiratory chain (Pessayre et al., 2001) (Fig. 3). ROS and lipid peroxidation also induce ultrastructural mitochondrial alterations and megamitochondria (Matsuhashi et al., 1996; Wakabayashi, 2002). As mentioned previously, patients with NASH present ultrastructural mitochondrial lesions, with the presence of crystal-line inclusions in megamitochondria (Sanyal et al., 2001). Lastly, some lipid peroxidation products are potent inducers of the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) that can lead to cell death (Kristal et al., 1996).

**Lipid peroxidation and ROS-dependent vicious cycles.** Lipid peroxidation-induced mitochondrial dysfunction leads to the generation of more mitochondrial ROS by the damaged respiratory chain. Increased mitochondrial ROS formation may trigger several vicious cycles, since ROS further damage mitochondria to exacerbate ROS generation by the respiratory chain (Fig. 3).

1. ROS and reactive nitrogen species directly damage mtDNA, respiratory chain polypeptides and mitochondrial cardiolipin (Pessayre et al., 2001; Demeilliers et al., 2002; Druzhyna et al., 2005). The mitochondrial genome is particularly prone to oxidative damage, which causes oxidation and loss of bases (thus generating DNA lesions such as 8-OH-dG and abasic sites, respectively), strand breaks, multiple mtDNA deletions, and mtDNA depletion (Fromenty and Pessayre, 1995; Demeilliers et al., 2002). Increased levels of 8-OH-dG in hepatic mtDNA are found in different models of fatty liver disease including in ob/ob mice and mice fed with a choline/methionine-deficient diet (Gao et al., 2004). Hence, hepatic mtDNA depletion in NASH (Haque et al., 2002) may be, at least in part, the consequence of increased oxidative stress. Interestingly, increased levels of 8-OH-dG, multiple mtDNA deletions and mtDNA depletion have been detected in the extra-hepatic tissues of diabetic animals and humans (Antonetti et al., 1995; Liang et al., 1997; Lee et al., 1998; Kakimoto et al., 2002). This suggests that oxidative stress-induced mtDNA lesions may not be restricted to liver in patients with NASH.

2. ROS cause NF-κB activation, which induces the synthesis of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) (Yin et al., 2001). TNF-α is also synthesized by fat-engorged adipocytes and, furthermore, is released by Kupffer cells stimulated by endotoxin. TNF-α can damage mitochondria, including mtDNA (Stadler et al., 1992; Suematsu et al., 2003; Hassanein, 2004; Nagakawa et al., 2005) and increase mitochondrial ROS formation (Schulze-Osthoff et al., 1992; Corda et al., 2001) (Figs. 2 and 3).

3. ROS may deplete some antioxidants to further aggravate ROS-induced damages. One study showed low levels of glutathione (GSH) in liver of obese ob/ob mice (Barnett et al., 1992), though another study found a significant increase in GSH content in ob/ob liver mitochondria (Yang et al., 2000). In contrast, we recently found an important decrease in mitochondrial GSH in ob/ob liver, while cytosolic GSH was preserved (Robin et al., in press). Though the reason of this discrepancy is not known, it is possible that age of the animals and their diet could explain, at least in part, the differences observed in mitochondrial GSH (Armeni et al., 1998; Grattagliano et al., 2004). We also found a significant decrease in glutathione s-transferase activity within the cytosol and mitochondria in ob/ob fatty liver (Robin et al., in press). Recently, lower hepatic expression of the Mu-class glutathione s-transferase has been reported in obese patients with steatosis in comparison with obese individuals without NAFLD (Younossi et al., 2005). Thus, low levels of GSH and decreased expression and/or activity of some glutathione-related enzymes may have additional deleterious effects on fatty liver. Lastly, low serum levels of vitamin E are found in some obese children with steatohepatitis (Strauss, 1999), and supplementation with vitamin E can decrease transaminases in obese children (Lavine, 2000).

4. Finally, increased mitochondrial ROS further augment lipid peroxidation to release more reactive aldehydes that further damage mtDNA and respiratory chain polypeptides (Pessayre et al., 2001).
Thus several vicious cycles can damage mitochondria and enhance ROS formation in patients with NASH.

### 4.2. From ROS formation to steatohepatitis

As mentioned above, ROS cause lipid peroxidation, which releases reactive aldehydes such as MDA and 4-HNE (Pessayre et al., 1999; 2001). ROS also increase the expression of several cytokines, including transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), interleukin-8 (IL-8), TNF-α and Fas ligand. Both lipid peroxidation products and cytokines could be involved in the different lesions of NASH such as cell death (through apoptosis and necrosis), inflammation, and fibrosis (Fig. 4). Details regarding the individual role of ROS, lipid peroxidation products and cytokines can be found in recent reviews (Fromenty et al., 2004; Pessayre and Fromenty, 2005). Lastly, beside ROS and cytokines, adipocytokines such as leptin could also favor some liver lesions in obese individuals (Fig. 4), though leptin could have an antisteatotic effect, as previously mentioned (Lee et al., 2001; Unger, 2005). In particular, leptin increases ROS production, especially by the respiratory chain (Bouloumie et al., 1999; Yamagishi et al., 2001), although this effect has not been reported in liver cells thus far. More importantly, leptin has a permissive effect on hepatic fibrogenesis (Leclercq et al., 2002; Tang et al., 2002). First, leptin acts on Kupffer cells, hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells and stellate cells to release more TGF-β (Tang et al., 2002; Ikejima et al., 2002; Saxena et al., 2002). Second, leptin also directly increases collagen formation by stellate cells (Saxena et al., 2002).

### 5. Pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic means able to prevent mitochondrial dysfunction in NASH

#### 5.1. Current management of NASH

In the past few years, data from several experimental and clinical investigations suggested that different drugs could be useful to prevent and/or treat NASH. Drugs that could be promising include metformin (Lin et al., 2000; Marchesini et al., 2001) and rosiglitazone (Neuschwander-Tetri et al., 2003) which increase insulin sensitivity, some lipid-lowering agents such as fibrates (Rao et al., 2002; Basaranoglu et al., 1999; Ip et al., 2003) or probucol (Merat et al., 2003), and also betaine which may improve VLDL secretion (Abdelmalek et al., 2001). The antioxidant vitamin E (α-tocopherol), either alone (Lavine, 2000; Roberts, 2002), or in association with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) (Dufour et al., 2005) could also become adjunct therapy, if its beneficial effects are confirmed. Pentoxifylline, a drug commonly used for the treatment of peripheral vascular disease and intermittent claudication, could be also of benefit in NASH by reducing TNF-α synthesis (Adams et al., 2004; Koppe et al., 2004; Satapathy et al., 2004; Robin et al., in press). Another compound that also deserves interest is L-carnitine (Liang et al., 1999), a cofactor mandatory for mitochondrial oxidation of long-chain fatty acids, although this natural compound has not been tested in patients with NASH. Lastly, different studies showed that an appropriate reduction of calorie intake and regular work out could improve liver function in patients with NASH (Kugelmas et al., 2003; Ramesh and Sanyal, 2005).

Interestingly, many of these drugs have direct or indirect effects on mitochondrial function (Table 2). Of course, more investigations will be required in the future in order to determine whether these mitochondrial effects are directly responsible for the improvement of NASH. However, as discussed below, there is already some evidence for such a relationship.

#### 5.2. Drugs, natural compounds and life style habits able to improve mitochondrial function in NASH

**Metformin.** The biguanide metformin ($N^1,N^1$-dimethylbiguanide) is used extensively in the treatment of type 2 diabetes (Kirpichnikov et al., 2002), and as mentioned previously, this drug could be beneficial in NASH (Lin et al., 2000; Marchesini et al., 2001). The main antidiabetic effect of this drug is most probably due to a reduction of hepatic gluconeogenesis, but increased insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in muscle and adipose tissue could also play a role (Hundal et al., 2000; Kirpichnikov et al., 2002). Interestingly, metformin activates AMPK in different tissues including liver and muscle (Zhou et al., 2001; Musi et al., 2002) (Table 2). AMPK activation in liver decreases the expression of different enzymes involved in gluconeogenesis (i.e. PEPCK and glucose-6-phosphatase) and inactivates ACC, thus decreasing malonyl-CoA levels (Winder

and Hardie, 1999; Lochhead et al., 2000). As previously mentioned, decreased malonyl-CoA levels favor the mitochondrial oxidation of long-chain fatty acids, since CPT-I is less inhibited by its endogenous inhibitor. In addition, AMPK could also activate CPT-I in a malonyl-CoA-independent manner (Velasco et al., 1998). Beside its stimulating effect on mitochondrial FAO, AMPK activation also shuts down hepatic lipogenesis, first by decreasing malonyl-CoA, and also by decreasing the expression of SREBP-1 (Zhou et al., 2001) and its downstream targets, ACC and FAS (Ruderman and Prentki, 2004). Hence, in liver, metformin will tip the balance of lipid homeostasis toward more oxidation and less storage (Winder and Hardie, 1999; Ruderman and Prentki, 2004).

Beside its effects on FAO, AMPK activation could have a broader effect on mitochondrial function. Indeed, AMPK activation in muscle is associated with an increased expression of proteins involved in the tricarboxylic acid cycle (e.g. malate dehydrogenase, citrate synthase) and the respiratory chain (e.g. succinate dehydrogenase, cytochrome c) (Winder et al., 2000; Suwa et al., 2003). Whether this AMPK-mediated effect is operative in liver remains to be determined. However, it is tempting to speculate that metformin, via AMPK activation, could enhance not only mitochondrial FAO but also could improve electron transfer in some segments of the respiratory chain. Lastly, metformin also decreases TNF-$\alpha$ expression in fatty liver (Lin et al., 2000) (Table 2), and this effect could also improve mitochondrial function as discussed previously.

The mechanism whereby metformin activates AMPK is not fully understood. Some investigations suggest that AMPK activation could be the consequence of an inhibition of complex I of the respiratory chain (Owen et al., 2000; Zou et al., 2004; Brunmair et al., 2004). This inhibition would decrease ATP and increase AMP, which would activate AMPK (Owen et al., 2000; Brunmair et al., 2004). Although this hypothesis deserves further investigations, it is worth mentioning that metformin is a relatively weak inhibitor of complex I, and that inhibition occurs at supra-pharmacological concentrations of the drug (Owen et al., 2000; Brunmair et al., 2004). Metformin could thus have differential effect on the mitochondrial respiratory chain, causing a slight reduction of complex I activity and perhaps an improvement of electron transfer through the remaining segments of the respiratory chain. Interestingly, beside AMPK activation, impairment of complex I by metformin could also inhibit the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) and cell death induced by different inducers including oxidative stress (Guigas et al., 2004). Because MPT and cell death are involved in NASH, metformin-induced MPT inhibition could play a major role in the beneficial effect provided by this drug.

Thiazolidinediones (TZDs). TZDs, also named glitazones, are a new class of insulin-sensitizing drugs used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. This class of drugs includes, pioglitazone, rosiglitazone, ciglitazone, and also troglitazone, which, however, has been withdrawn from the market due to several cases of severe hepatotoxicity (Kohlroser et al., 2000). At the molecular level, TZDs act as highly specific ligands of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-$\gamma$ (PPAR$\gamma$), and indeed PPAR$\gamma$ activation in different tissues including adipose tissue plays a central role in their anti-diabetic effects (Chao et al., 2000).

Several studies suggested that TZDs could be useful for the treatment of NASH in overweight or obese patients (Neuschwander-Tetri et al., 2003; Tiikkainen et al., 2004; Promrat et al., 2004). This beneficial action of TZDs in NASH could be mediated, at least in part, by improved insulin sensitivity in liver, through both indirect and direct effects (Tiikkainen et al., 2004; Kim and Ahn, 2004). Indirect effects could include reduced FFA levels and increased adiponectin levels in plasma (Bouskila et al., 2005), while direct effects could involve PPAR$\gamma$ activation in liver (Kim and Ahn, 2004). However, beside PPAR$\gamma$ activation, there is some evidence that TZD-mediated improvement of insulin sensitivity in liver could also involve AMPK activation (Saha et al., 2004; Bouskila et al., 2005) (Table 2).

It is still unclear how TZDs could directly stimulate AMPK in liver, though some data suggest that an inhibition of complex I of the respiratory chain could be involved (Brunmair et al., 2004). As discussed previously, complex I inhibition could in turn reduce ATP synthesis and the ATP/AMP ratio, thus activating AMPK (Brunmair et al., 2004). Different PPAR$\gamma$ ligands such as troglitazone, ciglitazone, pioglitazone and rosiglitazone are mild to moderate inhibitors of complex I, in particular in hepatic mitochondria (Brunmair et al., 2004; Scatena et al., 2004), and pioglitazone reduces the ATP/AMP ratio in rat liver (Saha et al., 2004). Thus, like metformin, TZDs could activate AMPK by interacting with complex I of the respiratory chain. Interestingly, TZDs interact specifically with a novel mitochondrial protein (the so-called ‘mitoNEET’ protein) localized within the inner mitochondrial membrane and which could interact with proteins involved in OXPHOS (Colca et al., 2004). Whether TZD interaction with the mitoNEET protein is responsible for complex I inhibition and AMPK activation will need further investigations. Finally, as previously discussed with metformin, it remains to be determined whether TZD-mediated AMPK activation is responsible for a global improvement of mitochondrial function in the context of hepatic steatosis and NASH.

Adiponectin. Adiponectin (also called AdipoQ or Acrp30) is an adipokine (i.e. an adipocyte-derived hormone) circulating at high levels in the plasma (from 5 to 30 $\mu$g/ml in human plasma) (Diez and Iglesias, 2003). Adiponectin could improve insulin sensitivity via AMPK activation (Yamauchi et al., 2002; Chen et al., 2005), but other mechanisms are not excluded. Interestingly, plasma levels of adiponectin are inversely correlated with body fatness, and adiponectin decreases during the progression of diabetes (Berg et al., 2002; Tsao et al., 2002). Not surprisingly, low adiponectin levels are found in patients with hepatic steatosis and NASH (Pagano et al., 2005; Vuppalanchi et al., 2005) and adiponectin administration in ob/ob mice ameliorates hepatomegaly, steatosis and ALT abnormality (Xu et al., 2003). Although adiponectin administration seems difficult to implement in patients, increased adiponectin levels in plasma is easily achieved with the TZDs, as mentioned above.
Thus, adiponectin could have favorable effects on NASH by improving insulin sensitivity in liver via AMPK activation (Berg et al., 2002; Bouskila et al., 2005). AMPK activation could then ameliorate mitochondrial function including FAO, as previously discussed. Beside AMPK activation, adiponectin could indirectly improve mitochondrial function by reducing TNF-$\alpha$ levels, in particular in liver (Tsao et al., 2002; Masaki et al., 2004). Interestingly, adiponectin could also decrease TNF-$\alpha$ levels in plasma (Masaki et al., 2004), and this effect could in turn have favorable effect on adiponectin secretion by the adipose tissue. Indeed, TNF-$\alpha$ decreases the expression of adiponectin in murine and human adipocytes by suppressing its promoter activity (Tsao et al., 2002; Diez and Iglesias, 2003). Thus, adiponectin could stimulate its own expression in adipose tissue and increase its own plasma levels by reducing TNF-$\alpha$ levels.

**Fibrates.** Fibrates are hypolipidaemic drugs which are ligands of the nuclear receptor PPAR$\alpha$. This class of drugs includes clofibrate, fenofibrate, bezafibrate, ciprofibrate and gemfibrozil. Hepatic effects of fibrates have been tested in clinical studies in primary and secondary NASH. In primary NASH, one study showed no beneficial effect of clofibrate (Laurin et al., 1996), whereas in another study gemfibrozil improved liver tests, although histopathological data were not provided (Basaranoglu et al., 1999). Thus, although more clinical investigations are needed, all fibrates could not prove useful in primary NASH. It is also noteworthy that the efficacy of fibrates could decline in old individuals, as mentioned previously (Sanguino et al., 2004). Regarding secondary NASH, a recent study showed that bezafibrate can prevent the progression of NASH induced by tamoxifen even without any interruption of this anticancer drug (Ogawa et al., 2003).

PPAR$\alpha$ activation by fibrates increases the expression of a large array of enzymes involved in lipid metabolism, including several mitochondrial enzymes (including CPT-I), thus increasing FAO (Kersten et al., 1999) (Table 2). The liver expresses high levels of PPAR$\alpha$, so that fibrate administration significantly increases mitochondrial $\beta$-oxidation of fatty acids in this tissue (Mancini et al., 2001; Lanni et al., 2002). Increased hepatic FAO by fibrates is responsible for a decrease in liver lipids and triglycerides in different rodent models of NAFLD linked to obesity and insulin resistance (Mancini et al., 2001; Chou et al., 2002; Nagai et al., 2002; Ip et al., 2004). Interestingly, fibrates could not only improve FAO but also respiratory chain activity. Indeed, fibrates and other PPAR-$\alpha$ ligands increase hepatic mRNAs of different mtDNA-encoded respiratory chain polypeptides (Cai et al., 1996; Nagai et al., 2002). Moreover, this is associated with increased mtDNA copy number and augmented expression (mRNA and protein) of the mitochondrial transcription factor A (mtTFA) which plays a key role for the regulation of mtDNA transcription and replication (Nagai et al., 2002). Thus, fibrates may also activate the respiratory chain activity, thus allowing a better reoxidation of the excess of reducing equivalents generated by the increased FAO.

Finally, it is important to keep in mind that fibrates also have anti-inflammatory properties which could be, at least in part,

the consequence of lower TNF-$\alpha$ production and decreased NF-$\kappa$B activation (Delerive et al., 2000; Zhao et al., 2003).

**Vitamin E.** Vitamin E ($\alpha$-tocopherol), a lipophilic antioxidant, could be useful in NASH not only in adults (Hasegawa et al., 2001; Harrison et al., 2003; Dufour et al., 2005) but also in children (Lavine, 2000; Roberts, 2002). Vitamin E scavenges mitochondrial ROS generated by the respiratory chain (Vrablic et al., 2001). Furthermore, this antioxidant is able to prevent hepatic mtDNA damage after administration of one or repeated doses of ethanol in mice (Mansouri et al., 2001; Demeilliers et al., 2002). Although vitamin E administration enriches liver mitochondria with this antioxidant, vitamin E levels increase even more in other cell compartments such as microsomes (Gumpricht et al., 2004). Interestingly, some derivatives of vitamin E such as $\alpha$-tocopheryl-succinate could accumulate more easily within liver mitochondria, thus affording better mitochondrial protection against oxidative stress when compared to the parent antioxidant (Fariss et al., 2001) (Table 2). An experimental vitamin E derivative, which may also prove useful, is the so-called ‘mitoVit E’ designed to be targeted to the mitochondria (Echtay et al., 2002). This derivative harbors a covalently linked lipophilic triphenylphosphonium cation, which allows its electrophoretic accumulation into the mitochondrial matrix thanks to the membrane potential (Echtay et al., 2002).

Another vitamin E derivative is Trolox, which is a water-soluble compound because it lacks the hydrophobic hydrocarbon phytyl tail. Trolox presents a broad antioxidant activity and prevents lipid peroxidation more efficiently than vitamin E (Rezk et al., 2004). Studies with this antioxidant suggested that Trolox is able to scavenge mitochondrial ROS (Ding et al., 2004) and prevent mitochondrial dysfunction induced by extramitochondrial oxidative stress (Wu and Cederbaum, 2002; Tapner et al., 2004). However, it seems that Trolox does not penetrate efficiently into the mitochondrial matrix (Echtay et al., 2002). Nonetheless, because of its potent protective effect against lipid peroxidation it would be worthy to evaluate the efficacy of Trolox in experimental models of NASH.

**MnTBAP.** Manganese (III) tetrakis (4-benzoic acid) porphyrin, also called MnTBAP, is a metalloporphyrin SOD mimetic able to scavenge superoxide anion, hydrogen peroxide and peroxynitrite and to inhibit lipid peroxidation (Patel and Day, 1999; Ding et al., 2004). MnTBAP ameliorates steatosis and liver abnormalities in ob/ob mice (Laurent et al., 2004), thus suggesting that this SOD mimetic could prove useful in primary NASH (Table 2). Moreover, MnTBAP rescues MnSOD$^{-/-}$ knockout mice from marked hepatic steatosis and from dilated cardiomyopathy (Melov et al., 1998). In human hepatoma HepG2 cells treated with the nucleoside analogue d4T, MnTBAP prevents mitochondrial damage and cytotoxicity induced by this antiretroviral drug (Velsor et al., 2004).

Studies on MnSOD$^{-/-}$ mice (Li et al., 1995; Lebovitz et al., 1996) and their rescue with MnTBAP (Melov et al., 1998) point to a major role of oxidative stress in mitochondrial damage, as previously mentioned. Moreover, these data
indicate that a strong oxidative stress within hepatic mitochondria is able to alter mitochondrial FAO and that efficient ROS scavenging restores fatty acid utilization. Although the events leading to impaired FAO in MnSOD-deficient mice are not fully characterized, some evidence suggests that oxidative damage to mtDNA and other key mitochondrial components could play a key role (Li et al., 1995; Williams et al., 1998). Interestingly, ethanol intoxication could impair FAO and induce hepatic steatosis through a similar mechanism (Fromenty et al., 1995; Demeilliers et al., 2002).

**Ursodeoxycholic acid.** Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is a natural hydrophilic bile acid normally present in human bile at low concentration (Serviddio et al., 2004). UDCA administration improves long-term survival in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis, and ameliorates liver tests in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis, intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy and other chronic cholestatic liver diseases. Recent clinical and experimental investigations point to a slight beneficial effect of UDCA in NASH, although the reduction of liver enzymes in plasma was not always associated with an improvement of liver histology (Laurin et al., 1996; Kiyici et al., 2003; Lindor et al., 2004; Dufour et al., 2005; Fan et al., 2005). Because UDCA can be administered orally and is generally well tolerated, it may be one therapeutic option for NASH in the future.

UDCA has choleretic, cytoprotective, anti-apoptotic and antioxidant effects (Angulo, 2002; Fan et al., 2005). UDCA prevents apoptosis induced by diverse death inducers including TGF-β and Fas ligand (Rodrigues et al., 1999; Azzaroli et al., 2002). UDCA could prevent apoptosis by preventing Bax translocation to mitochondria and MPT (Rodrigues et al., 1999) (Table 2). Interestingly, UDCA could enter the mitochondria (Azzaroli et al., 2002), but it is still unknown if this bile acid interacts with components of the MPT pore. UDCA could also prevent apoptosis through an improved antioxidant status within mitochondria (Table 2). Indeed, UDCA increases mitochondrial levels of reduced glutathione (GSH) possibly by up-regulating γ-glutamyl cysteine synthetase, a rate limiting enzyme involved in GSH synthesis (Serviddio et al., 2004). All these mitochondrial and anti-apoptotic effects could explain why UDCA could be of some benefit in NASH.

**L-carnitine.** L-carnitine is a cofactor mandatory for the mitochondrial oxidation of long-chain fatty acids (Fromenty and Pessayre, 1995). It also favors the removal of toxic endogenous metabolites, such as acyl-CoA intermediates (Walter, 1996) (Table 2). L-carnitine administration in rodents decreases liver triglycerides and hepatic steatosis after administration of a high fat diet (Seccombe et al., 1987), after total parenteral nutrition (Liang et al., 1999), or after alcohol intoxication (Sachan et al., 1984; Bykov et al., 2003). Interestingly, in one study dealing with ethanol-induced liver damage, L-carnitine even reduced hepatic inflammation and plasma levels of ALT and TNF-α (Bykov et al., 2003). Recently, we showed that L-carnitine administration in mice prevented d4T-induced triglyceride accumulation in liver, in vivo impairment of FAO and elevation of liver enzymes (ALT and LDH) in plasma (Igoudjil et al., 2005). Importantly, the protective effect of L-carnitine was not due to a replenishment of L-carnitine store in liver and plasma since d4T did not reduce L-carnitine in these tissues. Thus, L-carnitine may be useful as an adjuvant therapy for the treatment of steatosis and steatohepatitis in different physiopathologic situations.

Beside its effect on FAO, L-carnitine could also have beneficial effects on the mitochondrial respiratory chain. This has been shown in the context of aging, where L-carnitine reversed the aging-related impairment of mitochondrial electron transfer in liver possibly by increasing the mitochondrial content of cardiolipin (Hagen et al., 1998; 2002). In addition, L-carnitine has some antioxidant and anti-apoptotic properties (Andrieu-Abadie et al., 1999; Chang et al., 2002). The mechanisms whereby L-carnitine could mediate its antioxidant action is still unclear, but several studies pointed to increased levels of different antioxidant enzymes (e.g. SOD, catalase, glutathione peroxidase) and vitamins (e.g. vitamins C and E) (Dayanandan et al., 2001; Kumaran et al., 2003). Finally, L-carnitine could be anti-apoptotic through decreased ROS production, removal of toxic fatty acid derivatives and reduced generation of ceramide (Andrieu-Abadie et al., 1999; Chang et al., 2002).

**β-Aminoisobutyric acid.** β-Aminoisobutyric acid (BAIBA) is a natural catabolite of thymine, which is further degraded within mitochondria, especially in liver (Kakimoto et al., 1969; Griffith, 1986). BAIBA is able to stimulate FAO in liver and to reduce hepatic triglycerides and body fat mass in lean mice fed a standard diet (Note et al., 2003; Maisonneuve et al., 2004). BAIBA may stimulate hepatic FAO by increasing CPT-I expression (Note et al., 2003), but we do not exclude other mechanisms (Table 2). The effects of BAIBA on FAO, liver lipids and body fatness were negligible or absent in obese ob/ob mice (Maisonneuve et al., 2004), but the mild to moderate hepatic necroinflammation, apoptosis and fibrosis present in ob/ob liver were alleviated by BAIBA (Abbey-Toby et al., 2005). BAIBA also tended to reduce body fat mass in mice partially deficient in leptin (ob/+) fed with a hypercaloric diet (Begriche et al., 2005). In this murine model, BAIBA also had a favorable effect on plasma triglycerides (in the fed state), ALT and LDH, and it reduced hepatic steatosis and necroinflammation (Begriche et al., 2005). Thus, although more investigations are needed, BAIBA could prove useful in the prevention of diet-induced obesity and related disorders including steatosis and NASH.

**Exercise.** There is now some evidence that exercise could have a beneficial effect on NASH (Kugelmas et al., 2003; Neuschwander-Tetri et al., 2003). Physical exercise could improve insulin sensitivity in muscle by increasing AMPK activity (Musi et al., 2003; Ruderman et al., 2003). As discussed previously, enhanced AMPK activity increases FAO and removes fatty acid derivatives, which otherwise can have detrimental effects on insulin signaling. Interestingly, training also increases AMPK activity in liver and adipose tissue, thus suggesting that stimulation of FAO and improvement of insulin

sensitivity due to exercise is not restricted to muscle (Park et al., 2002; Ruderman et al., 2003).

## 6. Conclusion and future directions

In wealthy countries, new life-style habits combining rich diet and lack of exercise have caused a surge in obesity and metabolic syndrome. Excess of weight can trigger insulin resistance in adipose tissue, muscle and liver. Insulin resistance increases glucose/insulin levels and causes persistent adipocyte lipolysis which can induce fatty liver (Figs. 1 and 2). Because insulin resistance causes hepatic steatosis, and steatosis can cause NASH, there is a final, almost constant association of primary NASH with insulin resistance. However, it is important to remember that steatosis and steatohepatitis can be triggered by mechanisms other than insulin resistance. Indeed, long-term treatment with drugs such as amiodarone, tamoxifen or some antiretroviral drugs (e.g. AZT, d4T, ddl) can induce steatosis and steatohepatitis in some individuals. Interestingly, some drugs such as tamoxifen could preferentially induce steatohepatitis in obese individuals (Bruno et al., 2005). By the same token, even a moderate alcohol consumption can favor liver diseases in obese patients (Bellentani et al., 2000) and hepatic apoptosis in obese mice (Robin et al., in press). Thus, several concomitant factors can add their detrimental effects on liver (and especially on liver mitochondria) to trigger steatosis, cell death and steatohepatitis. In the future, more investigations will be needed in order to get more information regarding such additional (or potentiating) effects.

There is growing evidence that mitochondrial dysfunction play a central role in NASH whatever its origin. Not only mitochondrial dysfunction participates to fat accretion but it also leads to ROS generation (Figs. 2 and 3). Consequently, several vicious cycles involving lipid peroxidation, mitochondrial damage, ROS formation, depletion of antioxidants and cytokine release may cause necroinflammation and fibrogenesis in genetically susceptible patients (Figs. 3 and 4) (Fromenty et al., 2004).

Further studies are clearly required to better understand how these diverse effects interact with each other. These investigations should also determine which genetic, environmental, pharmacological and nutritional factors are involved in individual susceptibility, and which treatments can be used safely in patients who fail to lose weight, despite medical advice. Because mitochondrial dysfunction is central in the physiopathology of steatosis and NASH, drugs or other factors improving directly or indirectly mitochondrial function may prove useful in the prevention or the treatment of these liver diseases. Antioxidant molecules specifically targeted to the mitochondria could also be valuable, not only in NASH but also in type 2 diabetes. As there is an epidemic of obesity and related diseases in prosperous countries, reducing the incidence of NASH is a major challenge for the next decade. Hopefully, the combined efforts of parents, teachers, media, the food industry, physicians and drug companies may help to curb the worrying progression of obesity and NASH in affluent countries.
