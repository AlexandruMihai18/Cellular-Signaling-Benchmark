Genetic and biochemical studies have defined the Hippo pathway as a central mediator of developmental and pathogenic signals. By directing intracellular signaling events, the Hippo pathway fine-tunes cell proliferation, cell death, and cell-fate decisions, and coordinates these cues to specify animal organ size. Recent studies have revealed that Hippo pathway-mediated processes are interconnected with those of other key signaling cascades, such as those mediated by TGF-β and Wnt growth factors. Moreover, several reports have described a role for cell contact-mediated polarity proteins in Hippo pathway regulation. Emerging details suggest that crosstalk between these signals drives fundamental developmental processes, and deregulated intercellular communication influences disease progression, such as cancer. We review recent data with a focus on how the Hippo pathway integrates its activity with other signaling pathways.

### Networking in development

The delineation of signaling pathways provides a starting point for understanding the intricacy of animal development. It is clear that signaling pathways are organized into ordered networks, allowing contextual responses to diverse cues that direct developmental events. Disorganization of these networks is associated with severe diseases such as cancer. Understanding the molecular links that underlie the assembly and function of such networks is therefore crucial for developing effective therapeutics for complex disorders.

Interactions between pathways can take place at multiple levels. Simple cell–cell contacts result in the activation of intracellular cues that modulate the assembly of protein complexes. Cells also commonly communicate via long-range signals, such as secreted morphogens, which interact with receptors on distant cells. These avenues of cell communication lead to the initiation of protein signaling pathways that influence cell-fate decisions, cell proliferation, apoptosis, cell shape and/or cell movements [1–3]. How a cell determines whether, and in what manner, to respond to extracellular stimuli is poorly understood.

discovery and study of the Hippo pathway, a major regulator of tissue growth and organ size, is shedding some light on these relationships. The Hippo pathway intersects directly with several signaling cascades. We review here evidence of these connections and discuss how the Hippo pathway impacts upon the translation of extrinsic signals.

### The Hippo pathway

Genetic screens to find novel tumor suppressor genes in *Drosophila melanogaster* initially defined the Hippo pathway; mutations in its participants resulted in tissue overgrowth, the defining phenotypic signature of this signaling cascade. Three upstream factors were originally identified, including the Ste20-like kinase Hippo (Hpo), the NDR-like kinase Warts (Wts) and the adaptor protein Salvador (Sav) [4–10]. Subsequently, several other pathway components have been implicated, including Mob-as-tumor-suppressor (Mats) and the most prominent downstream mediator of the pathway, the transcriptional regulator Yorkie (Yki) [11]. In parallel, studies in mammalian systems were uncovering important roles for the mammalian homologs to these fly proteins. In fact, at almost the same time that Wts was characterized, YAP, a homolog of Yki, was identified as the first protein containing the WW domain [12,13], named from two signature tryptophan residues. The Hippo pathway is highly conserved in mammals. The Ste20-like kinases Mst1 and Mst2 (homologs of Hpo), with the help of the adaptors Sav1 (also known as WW45; homolog of Sav) and Mobkl1a and Mobkl1b (homologs of Mats), relay signals to the NDR-like kinases Lats1 and Lats2 (homologs of Wts) [14–16]. Active Lats1 and Lats2 subsequently phosphorylate the transcriptional regulators TAZ (also known as Wwtr1) and YAP (homologs of Yki) [17–19]. Mammalian cell-culture studies revealed that TAZ and YAP phosphorylation at a key serine residue (Ser89 in human TAZ, and Ser127 in human YAP) promotes binding to 14-3-3 proteins. This event, together with phosphorylation of other specific serine residues (Ser66, Ser117, Ser311 in human TAZ [18], and Ser61, Ser109, Ser164, Ser381 in human YAP [19]), results in TAZ and YAP cytoplasmic sequestration and thus inhibition of their transcriptional regulatory activity [18–21]. Genetics in flies supports these observations, and indicates that one of the crucial roles for the

Hippo pathway is to phosphorylate Yki and restrict its transcriptional activity [17,22,23].

Integrating Hippo pathway signals in the nucleus

In common with most signaling cascades, the primary output of the Hippo cascade is to regulate transcription. TAZ and YAP (and Yki) do not bind DNA directly, and therefore must be recruited to DNA by transcription factors [24]. Some of the first-characterized binding partners of TAZ and YAP were the Runt domain-containing Runx transcription factors [12,25,26]. Runx family members play key roles in regulating mesenchymal stem cell differentiation during bone formation [27], and therefore the regulation of Runx activity by TAZ or YAP affects mesenchymal stem cell differentiation [28,29].

Another well-studied subset of transcription factors controlled by YAP is the p53-related family of p73 proteins. The WW domain of YAP binds to PPXY-containing p73 family members, thereby promoting their transcriptional activity [20,30,31]. YAP binding also protects p73 from ubiquitin-mediated degradation by preventing interaction with WW-domain containing ubiquitin ligases [32]. Together, p73 and YAP target a number of genes, including PML, which interacts with YAP, leading to its sumoylation and stabilization [30,33]. This creates a feed-forward autoregulatory circuit that drives apoptosis. Interestingly, while genetic studies in *D. melanogaster* suggest that Yki inhibits apoptosis [11], studies of p73 indicate that YAP can also participate in pro-apoptotic signaling [20]. Hence, it appears that the Hippo pathway may have roles in both processes, although the temporal and contextual determinants for switching between these biological outcomes remain to be uncovered.

The best-described transcription factors regulated by TAZ and YAP are the TEAD/TEF family of DNA-binding proteins, which in humans and mice are composed of four highly homologous members that are widely expressed in various tissues [34]. TAZ and YAP strongly bind the TEADs to promote their transcriptional activity [35,36]. The N-terminal domain of TAZ and YAP is composed of two short helices and a twisted coil region that wrap around an immunoglobulin-like domain at the C-terminus of the TEADs [37–39]. Amino acid substitutions within the binding interfaces, such as Ser94Ala in human YAP or Ser51-Ala in human TAZ, disrupt interactions with the TEADs [40,41]. The TEAD family is implicated in the tissue growth-regulatory activity of TAZ and YAP [41,42]. The TEAD homolog in *D. melanogaster*, Scalloped, binds to Yki and mediates the growth-promoting activity of Yki, indicating conservation of this role [43–45]. There is a convincing association between TEAD-mediated cell proliferation and TAZ and YAP. Overexpression of TAZ or YAP in epithelial cell lines, such as MCF10A cells, results in the acquisition of oncogenic properties including hyperproliferation, anchorage-independent growth, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) [18,46]. The oncogenic features associated with TAZ or YAP overexpression are related to TEAD activity because disruption of TEAD binding ablates these phenotypes [40,41]. TAZ and YAP-dependent regulation of TEAD activity also plays crucial roles during animal development, including the regulation

of neural tube, notochord and somite development [47]. During neural tube development YAP-TEAD activity drives the expression of Pax3 for neural crest induction [48], and also contributes to the maintenance of neural progenitor cell populations by inducing proliferation through the regulation of cyclin D1, and inhibiting differentiation by suppressing NeuroM [49].

A general role for TAZ and YAP in the regulation of embryonic and somatic stem cell populations and cell-fate decisions is emerging. TAZ has a crucial role in regulating mesenchymal stem cell differentiation [28]. In this role, TAZ binding to the transcription factor Runx2 promotes osteoblast lineage specification, whereas TAZ binding to the transcription factor PPARγ inhibits adipogenesis [28]. Recent studies *in vivo* in the skin have shown that nuclear YAP localization strongly correlates with the proliferative potential of single-layered basal epidermal progenitors, with a shift of YAP to the cytoplasm accompanying differentiation of hair follicles [50–52]. Ectopic expression of YAP expands the basal epidermal progenitors and prevents their terminal differentiation, subsequently leading to tumor formation [50,51]. A similar scenario exists in the mouse intestine, where overexpression of YAP leads to the expansion of undifferentiated progenitor cells, and ultimately intestinal dysplasia [53]. Interestingly, both Wnt and Notch pathway activity in these progenitor cells is deregulated, implicating integration of Hippo signaling with these pathways. Similar results have also been observed in the *D. melanogaster* intestine and the optic lobe, where nuclear Yki promotes the expansion of progenitor cell populations [54–58]. In these cases, a genetic relationship between Hippo and JAK-STAT signaling was uncovered, highlighting additional pathway crosstalk that warrants further study.

The clearest role for TAZ and YAP regulation of cell-fate decisions may be in the pre-implantation mouse embryo. As cells in morula-stage embryos divide, the inner cells become compacted by the outer cells [2]. TAZ and YAP localization is regulated during this process, with the outer cells displaying nuclear TAZ and YAP whereas the inner cells, which make up the inner cell mass (ICM), display cytoplasmic localization [59]. In the outer cells, nuclear TAZ and YAP bind TEAD4 to stimulate the expression of Cdx2, which specifies these cells to a trophectoderm lineage [59]. Deletion of both TAZ and YAP in a mouse model disturbs cell fate specification during pre-implantation development [59]. Deletion of YAP alone results in lethality at approximately embryonic (E) day E8.5 [37], and deletion of TAZ leads to incompletely penetrant late embryonic lethality [60–62]. Thus, functional redundancy between TAZ and YAP is important for directing early developmental events.

A key role also exists for TAZ and YAP in embryonic stem cell (ESC) regulation, which highlights a relationship between the Hippo pathway and signaling initiated by the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) superfamily. Human ESC pluripotency, which relies on TGF-β-Smad signaling [63,64], is dependent on TAZ activity [65]. YAP functions in a similar role by guiding the stem cell state of mouse ESCs, as well as the reprogramming process of mouse fibroblasts to an induced pluripotent state (iPS)

via the regulation of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)–
Smad responses [66,67]. These and other studies are re-
vealing that Hippo pathway activity is intimately linked to
TGF-β signaling (Figure 1).

The TGF-β superfamily of proteins is a group of secreted
morphogens comprised of TGF-βs, BMPs, activins and
growth differentiation factors. These morphogens signal
via binding to serine-threonine kinase receptors, which
phosphorylate the receptor-regulated Smad (R-Smad) pro-
teins. Distinct R-Smads mediate the various responses;
Smad2 and Smad3 mediate TGF-β and activin signals,
whereas Smad1, Smad5 and Smad8 propagate BMP sig-
nals. Phosphorylated R-Smads bind to the co-Smad,
Smad4, and subsequently accumulate in the nucleus to
regulate transcription. Smad complexes themselves have
low DNA-binding affinity; however, they can target specific
regulatory elements by associating with other DNA-bind-
ing transcription factors to potently activate transcription
[68–70].

The propensity of R-Smads to bind TAZ was revealed
from a high-throughput screen aimed at identifying novel
regulators of TGF-β signaling [65]. TAZ was found to
associate with heteromeric TGF-β-regulated R-Smad–
Smad4 complexes [65]. Later, YAP was shown to bind
BMP-regulated Smad1/5/8 and TGF-β-regulated Smad2/
3 [66,71]. TAZ and YAP interaction with Smad complexes
leads to their recruitment to TGF-β- or BMP-regulated
enhancers, where they direct TGF-β- and BMP-regulated
transcriptional events [65,66] (Figure 1a). Knockdown of
TAZ and/or YAP abrogates signaling mediated by Smads
[65,66,71]. Interestingly, knockdown studies also revealed
that Smads fail to accumulate in the nucleus in response to
TGF-β in the absence of TAZ and/or YAP [65,71]. Thus,
TAZ and YAP mediate TGF-β-induced Smad nuclear ac-
cumulation. Given that Smads associate with a range of
other transcription factors, including several TAZ- and
YAP-regulated factors, such as the Runx and p53-related
family members [72,73], it is possible that TAZ and YAP
recruit Smads to integrate TGF-β signals with the function
of these proteins. Whether this holds true for all TAZ- and
YAP-regulated transcription factors, including the TEADs,
remains to be seen.

TAZ and YAP integrate the transcriptional regulatory
machinery with Smads. For example, the Mediator com-
plex is suggested to participate in TAZ/YAP–Smad regula-
tion because TAZ interacts with Mediator component
ARC105 to enable assembly of active transcriptional ma-
chinery [65]. Furthermore, the YAP–Smad1 interaction is
regulated by the Mediator-associated kinases CDK8 and
CDK9 [66], which phosphorylate the Smad1 linker domain
to expose a PPXY motif and promote binding to the YAP
WW domains [66]. The serine residues in the Smad1 linker
domain also promote interaction with YAP [66], although
the Smad3–YAP interaction is not regulated by linker
domain phosphorylation [66], and the TAZ–Smad2/3 inter-
action is mediated by a region in TAZ that is C-terminal to
the WW domain [65]. This suggests that TGF-β- and BMP-
regulated Smads may bind differentially to TAZ and YAP.
Alternatively, TAZ and YAP could bind to Smads via
multiple interfaces that may be distinctly regulated to

**Figure 1. Cell density-mediated control of the Hippo pathway directs TGF-β signaling.** (a) At low cell density the Hippo pathway kinases LATS1/2 are inactive, resulting in
increased nuclear localization of TAZ/YAP. Upon TGF-β stimulation SMAD complexes form and bind to TAZ/YAP in the nucleus. TAZ/YAP retains SMAD complexes in the
nucleus and facilities the recruitment of key transcriptional machinery to drive transcriptional events. (b) At high cell density, polarity-regulating proteins are recruited to
sites of cell contact. The apically localized Crumbs polarity complex, as well as the adherens junction-localized protein α-catenin, form contacts with TAZ/YAP and facilitate
their phosphorylation by active LATS1/2 kinases. Phosphorylation of TAZ/YAP mediates binding with 14-3-3 proteins, thereby resulting in their cytoplasmic localization.
Following TGF-β stimulation, SMAD complexes bind to cytoplasmic TAZ/YAP and nuclear transcriptional events are inhibited.

facilitate diverse molecular functions beyond transcriptional activity. For example, binding of the YAP WW domain to the PPXY motif of Smad1 can prevent binding by the WW domain-containing Smurf and Nedd4L HECT domain ubiquitin ligases, thus stabilizing Smads [74].

The relationship between downstream Hippo pathway effectors and Smad proteins is conserved in *D. melanogaster*. Yki can bind to Mad, the fly homolog of Smad1/5/8 [66, 75], and the growth-promoting activity of Yki acts synergistically with Dpp-mediated Mad activity (Dpp being a BMP homolog). In vivo evidence indicates cooperation between Mad and Yki-mediated transcription, particularly in the regulation of the micro-RNA gene *bantam* [75, 76]. Interestingly, Dpp morphogen signaling can also influence the expression and localization of Fat-Hippo signaling pathway components [77], indicating regulatory feedback mechanisms. Thus, a complex network exists between TGF-β signaling and Hippo pathway mediators; understanding this network will require further studies.

The Hippo pathway also regulates Wnt-induced signaling [77, 78], another important mediator of animal development [79–81]. Wnt transcriptional responses are largely transduced by β-catenin. In the absence of Wnt ligands, β-catenin is unstable due to ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation. Upon Wnt stimulation, the β-catenin degradation complex is inhibited, leading to β-catenin nuclear accumulation and activation of target gene expression. Crosstalk between Hippo and Wnt, in part, converges in the nucleus at the transcriptional level (Figure 2), which

was revealed from examining the effects of Hippo pathway mutations on mouse heart development [77]. Cardiac muscle-specific conditional knockout of Sav, or Lats2, or conditional double knockout of Mst1 and Mst2, increase nuclear YAP activity, and this promotes increased cardiomyocyte proliferation and enlargement of the heart. Expression profiling of these mutants uncovered an elevated Wnt signature, suggesting that decreased activity of the Hippo pathway promotes Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Consistently, β-catenin nuclear localization is increased in Sav mutants, and conditional removal of one allele of β-catenin suppresses many of the associated defects. YAP is recruited to TCF/LEF binding sites together with β-catenin, revealing that YAP participates via its nuclear functions in Wnt/β-catenin signaling.

### Cytoplasmic roles for TAZ and YAP

Several studies indicate that the transcriptional regulatory roles of TAZ and YAP are a crucial aspect of their function. However, mechanisms leading to cytoplasmic localization of TAZ and YAP may promote additional ‘non-canonical’ cytoplasmic functions for these proteins. Based on several studies, these cytoplasmic functions may be more important than initially anticipated.

One role for TAZ and YAP in the cytoplasm is to inhibit TGF-β-regulated Smad signals. One example is YAP binding to the inhibitory Smad7 protein, which has a role in reducing TGF-β receptor activity [82]. Another role relates

**Figure 2. Crosstalk between the Hippo and Wnt/β-catenin pathways.** High Hippo-pathway kinase activity leads to cytoplasmic localization of TAZ and YAP. Cytoplasmic TAZ binds to DVL, thereby inhibiting the Wnt-induced phosphorylation of DVL proteins. As a consequence, β-catenin levels and nuclear accumulation are inhibited, thus, keeping Wnt/β-catenin signaling low. Following the inhibition of Hippo pathway kinases TAZ and YAP accumulate in the nucleus, resulting in increased Wnt/β-catenin signaling. This is achieved by relieving the inhibitory role that TAZ has on DVL in the cytoplasm, and also by promoting nuclear interactions between YAP and β-catenin, which facilitates TEAD and TCF/LEF-mediated transcriptional synergy.

to cytoplasmic TAZ and YAP acting to retain TGF-β-activated Smad complexes in the cytoplasm, thereby restricting Smad nuclear accumulation (Figure 1b). The effects of epithelial cell density on the localization of TAZ, YAP and Smads are striking. At high cell density, Smad proteins, along with TAZ and YAP, are cytoplasmic even in the presence of exogenous TGF-β ligand [71]. Disruption of cell contacts, or RNAi-mediated knockdown of Lats1 and Lats2 kinases, leads to increased nuclear TAZ and YAP, and consequently increased nuclear Smad complexes [71], suggesting that these proteins are under the same control mechanisms.

A representative example of the effects of cell density on TAZ and YAP localization *in vivo* is at early developmental stages of the mouse embryo. As mentioned earlier, TAZ and YAP are nuclear in outer trophectoderm cells and cytoplasmic in the ICM of late morula and blastocyst stage embryos [59]. Smad2/3 localization in the pre-implantation mouse embryo correlates with TAZ and YAP localization and is regulated by the Lats kinases [59,71]. In the later-stage pre-gastrula mouse embryo, where TGF-β/Smad signaling is understood to be a central regulator of embryo patterning [83], similar correlations between TAZ, YAP and Smad2 are observed [71]. In particular, cells that make up the visceral endoderm display nuclear TAZ and YAP along with nuclear Smad2/3 localization, whereas cells in the adjacent epiblast region display phosphorylated and prominent cytoplasmic YAP localization, along with decreased nuclear Smad2/3. Thus, Hippo pathway activity may play a key role in patterning of the early mouse embryo by controlling the competency of cells to respond to TGF-β-mediated signals. Interestingly, given that Smad complexes in the cytoplasm of the epiblast are in their phosphorylated and active state, this may provide both a memory of cellular exposure to TGF-β ligands and a mechanism to induce rapid Smad responses, such as those required for gastrulation.

Other cytoplasmic functions for TAZ and YAP have also been described. Similar to the relationship with TGF-β signaling, crosstalk between the Hippo pathway and the Wnt pathway was uncovered via high-throughput screening [84]. TAZ was found to have a cytoplasmic inhibitory role in Wnt/β-catenin signaling [78] (Figure 2). Wnt-induced β-catenin nuclear activity is elevated by either knockdown of TAZ, or by shifting TAZ localization to the nucleus by interfering with Lats kinases. Inhibition of Wnt signaling is due to alterations in DVL phosphorylation. DVL proteins are integral members of the Wnt pathway cascade that function upstream in the pathway to regulate the β-catenin destruction complex. TAZ binds to DVL proteins, thereby inhibiting DVL phosphorylation by casein kinase 1-delta and -epsilon kinases (CK1δ/ε), thus promoting β-catenin degradation.

Another potential cytoplasmic function for TAZ is as a scaffold for the SCF/β-TrCP ubiquitin ligase complex [62]. TAZ possesses a phosphodegron motif in its C-terminus that functions to recruit β-TrCP and promote the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of the calcium-permeable cation channel protein polycystin 2 (PC2) [62]. The same phosphodegron is also important for regulating TAZ and YAP as this motif is phosphorylated

by Lats1/2 kinases, priming it for subsequent phosphorylation by CK1δ/ε [85,86]. This second round of phosphorylation by CK1δ/ε promotes interaction with SCF/β-TrCP to promote TAZ and YAP ubiquitination, leading to their proteasomal degradation.

TAZ also plays a role in regulating primary cilia formation. Primary cilia are microtubule-based organelles that extend from cells and are thought to function as sensors of the extracellular environment. A subpopulation of TAZ localizes to primary cilia, and knockdown of TAZ results in decreased cilia length [60,62]. Consistent with this, TAZ knockout mice develop severe polycystic kidneys, with the cystic regions displaying increased Wnt/β-catenin signaling and disrupted cilia integrity [60–62]. TAZ regulation of PC2 stability may be an important part of its function at cilia. This role for TAZ is regulated via interaction with Nek1, which is a NIMA-related protein kinase important for centrosome stability and cilia formation [62,87]. Nek1 phosphorylates TAZ, and this inhibits TAZ-dependent regulation of PC2 stability. On the other hand, TAZ targets Nek1 for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. Together, the relationship between TAZ and Nek1 creates a mechanism to fine-tune PC2 levels. Interestingly, the cilia-associated protein NPHP4 interacts with LATS2 to regulate the Hippo pathway negatively [88], suggesting that TAZ, and probably YAP, regulation at cilia involves Hippo pathway activity. TAZ and YAP may also influence signaling events that are relayed by cilia. For example, the cilia-localized Glis3 transcription factor, which has a high degree of homology with the Hedgehog-regulated Gli transcription factors, is regulated by TAZ [89]. Hedgehog signaling is intimately associated with primary cilia [90], and therefore as yet uncovered associations between Hedgehog signaling and the Hippo pathway may exist. Evidence for a relationship between the two pathways is indicated in Hedgehog-associated medulloblastomas, which rely on nuclear YAP to propagate tumorigenic signals [91]. Taken together, studies suggest that primary cilia may function as a central organizing center for Hippo, Hedgehog, Wnt, and other signaling pathways [90]. However, understanding the molecular mechanisms linking these signals will require further studies.

Regulators of the Hippo pathway

The intracellular localization of TAZ and YAP has a tremendous influence on the ability of a cell to proliferate and respond to external cues. Therefore, understanding the nature of the signals that sense the external environment and relay information to the Hippo pathway is an important next step. The first transmembrane protein implicated as an upstream regulator of Hippo signals was the atypical cadherin Fat (Ft), and genetic analysis in the fly suggests that it functions as one (of many) cell-surface signals that control Hippo pathway activity [92–95]. Dachsous (Ds), another atypical cadherin, binds to the extracellular domain of Ft, and together they regulate Hippo pathway activity [92,96,97]. How Ft and Ds signal to the Hippo pathway has not been entirely deciphered, but studies suggest that they do so in part through the FERM domain protein Expanded (Ex) [92–95,98]. Homologs of Ex in mammals, such as FRMD6 (also known as Willin),

are also suggested to regulate Hippo pathway activity, but understanding these connections will require more analysis [99]. Another FERM domain protein, known as Merlin (Mer), is also linked to the Hippo pathway; in flies Mer and Ex interact and are localized to the apical domain of cells and function redundantly to regulate Hippo pathway output [100]. One study suggested that Ex inhibits Yki nuclear accumulation in part by directly sequestering Yki at the membrane [101], whereas another study suggests that Mer and Ex promote Wts phosphorylation and kinase activity [100]. This latter function may be related to the role of the protein Kibra, which in flies binds to both Mer and Ex [102–104]. Fly genetics place *Kibra* upstream of the Hippo kinases, and Kibra associates with and regulates Wts and Lats2 [105]. Although there is an association between Mer, Ex and Kibra, the direct mechanism by which this complex of proteins exerts signaling functions is less apparent.

Mouse models also support a role for Merlin in regulating Hippo pathway activity. Merlin, encoded by the *NF2* gene, has been long studied due to its mutation in neurofibromatosis type II, an inherited disease that results in the development of bilateral vestibular schwannomas [106]. Deletion of *NF2* from the mouse liver results in hepatocellular carcinomas, and this can be partially rescued by deletion of one copy of the *Yap* gene [107]. However, whether *NF2* directly impacts upon YAP activity was contested by another group that associated the hepatocellular carcinomas in *NF2⁻/⁻* kidneys with aberrant epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activity [108]. Perhaps the two events are linked, as YAP expression enhances expression of the EGFR ligand amphiregulin, which promotes non-cell-autonomous events [109]. Interestingly, although the molecular details connecting Merlin and the Hippo pathway are still not entirely deciphered, a clue to the mode of action of Merlin may be revealed by recently described interactions with the Angiomotin (Amot) and Crumbs polarity-complex components Pals1 and PatJ [110]. These interactions are probably linked to the roles of Merlin in organizing the assembly of α-catenin and Par3 junctional complexes [111], all of which are important for the establishment of cell polarity.

Cell polarity is mediated by the combined action of a set of protein complexes. The establishment of epithelial apical-basal polarity is the best-described and has been extensively characterized at the molecular level, revealing three major regulatory complexes: Crumbs (comprising Crb1-3, Pals1, Mpdz, PatJ and Lin7c), Par (comprising Par6, Par3 and aPKC) and Scribble (comprising Scrib, Dlg and Lgl) [112,113]. Cell-adhesion interactions between transmembrane cadherins, such as E-cadherin, lead to the recruitment of adherens junction proteins, such as β-catenin and, subsequently, α-catenin, the latter of which drives reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and initiates formation of tight junctions and recruitment of the Par complex [114]. Par complex recruitment to tight junctions in turn promotes apical localization of the Crumbs complex and basal localization of the Scrib complex, thus promoting apical-basal polarity [113].

Genetic studies in *D. melanogaster* have identified Crumbs, the transmembrane component of the Crumbs

complex, as a regulator of Hippo pathway activity [115–118]. These studies suggest that Crumbs binding to Ex directs Yki localization [115–118]. Work in mammals also indicates that the Crumbs complex is linked to TAZ and YAP regulation. Interestingly, Crumbs complex components and the associated protein Amot bind to TAZ and YAP [71,119–121]. Together these proteins regulate the phosphorylation and localization of TAZ and YAP (Figure 1b). In addition, α-catenin also associates with YAP [51], suggesting that multiple proteins important for the establishment of polarity contribute to regulation of the downstream Hippo pathway mediators. Interfering with cell–cell adhesions, or knocking down Crb3, Pals1, Amot or α-catenin, results in decreased TAZ and/or YAP phosphorylation and increased nuclear localization and transcriptional activity. Thus, assembly of the Crumbs complex following apical-basal polarization of cells provides a mechanism to sense cell contact and density and relay this information to the Hippo pathway.

TAZ and YAP localization is also linked to cell morphology and to mechanical cues that impact upon the cytoskeleton [122–124]. Increased cell tension promotes the localization of TAZ and YAP to the nucleus, whereas loss of cellular tension increases their cytoplasmic localization [122,124]. Observations in mammalian cell culture and in *D. melanogaster* indicate that F-actin levels contribute to the regulation of TAZ, YAP and Yki activity [122–124]. For example, deregulation of the actin-capping protein αβ heterodimer in *D. melanogaster*, which results in the abnormal accumulation of apical F-actin, inhibits nuclear Yki activity [125]. Small-molecule-mediated disruption of actin polymerization in mammalian cells also results in the inhibition of nuclear TAZ and YAP activity [122–124]. However, F-actin *per se* may not be the key influencing factor; instead, the key may be the abundance of stress fibers and Rho activity, which are regulated by mechanical forces and then act as mediators of TAZ/YAP localization [122]. Some of the mechanical force-related effects on TAZ and YAP are suggested to be mediated via the Hippo kinases [123,124], whereas other effects may be independent of these kinases [122]. Although this mode of TAZ and YAP regulation is important for the regulation of mesenchymal stem cell differentiation [122], there is still much left to be explored since mechanical force-mediated regulation of physiological processes are widespread.

Polarity, Hippo and cancer

Studies have indicated that the nuclear activities of TAZ and YAP promote the oncogenic potential of cells [15,16]. Numerous studies have also established a connection between regulation of cell polarity, cancer onset and progression [126,127]. In fact, the loss of cell polarity may not only be a consequence of cell transformation, but also a cause. Therefore, the connection between the Hippo pathway and polarity provides a potential explanation for these observations. Of particular interest is the relationship between the Hippo pathway and TGF-β signaling. It has long been known that during the early stages of cancer TGF-β inhibits cell-cycle progression, whereas at later stages, TGF-β promotes proliferation, EMT and metastasis [128,129]. Polarized epithelial cells possess cytoplasmic TAZ and

YAP, and this restricts TGF-β-induced Smad activity [71]. This is consistent with observations that most epithelial cells do not undergo a TGF-β-induced EMT [130]. However, loss of the Crumbs complex results in increased nuclear TAZ and YAP, increased Smad nuclear accumulation, and enhanced sensitivity to the TGF-β ligand [71]. This results in an altered transcriptional program, driven by Smad-dependent activity, which promotes EMT and the transformed phenotype [71]. Consistent with this, loss of Crb3 in epithelial models *in vivo* promotes tumor progression [131]. Thus, the status of Hippo pathway activity may be one difference that distinguishes the role of TGF-β in early-versus late-stage cancers in the context of tumor initiation and progression.

### Concluding remarks

The Hippo pathway appears to be an active participant at most levels of animal development and controls both cell-fate determination and tissue growth. The pathway is involved in complex signaling networks that are only beginning to be dissected. Despite the tremendous progress that has been made to date, many questions remain unanswered. For example, the mechanisms connecting upstream regulators with individual components of the pathway are largely unknown. There has also been progress with respect to characterization of the Hippo pathway in stem cell regulation, but the molecular details generally remain elusive. Because these questions have close ties to cancer progression and other human diseases, much work is needed before we can start to fully grasp the scope of the pathway and how extensively it is intertwined with morphogen signaling pathways. Fortunately, the study of the Hippo pathway is still at its infancy and there is much to discover. As time passes more researchers are taking note of its importance, and this will lead to novel approaches to study the pathway. Given its importance, the knowledge we gain will hopefully lead us to the development of therapies for diseases such as cancer, and tools to manipulate stem cells for the regeneration of tissues and organs.
