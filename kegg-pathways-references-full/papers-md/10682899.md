**ABSTRACT:** Neurotransmitter-regulation of fluid secretion in the salivary glands is achieved by a coordinated sequence of intracellular signaling events, including the activation of membrane receptors, generation of the intracellular second messenger, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, internal Ca²⁺ release, and Ca²⁺ influx. The resulting increase in cytosolic [Ca²⁺] ([Ca²⁺]i) regulates a number of ion transporters, *e.g.*, Ca²⁺-activated K⁺ channel, Na⁺/K⁺/2Cl⁻ co-transporter in the basolateral membrane, and the Ca²⁺-activated Cl⁻ channel in the luminal membrane, which are intricately involved in fluid secretion. Thus, regulation of [Ca²⁺]i is central to the regulation of salivary acinar cell function and is achieved by the concerted activities of several ion channels and Ca²⁺-pumps localized in various cellular membranes. Ca²⁺ pumps, present in the endoplasmic reticulum and the plasma membrane, serve to remove Ca²⁺ from the cytosol. Ca²⁺ channels present in the endoplasmic reticulum and the plasma membrane facilitate rapid influx of Ca²⁺ into the cytosol from the internal Ca²⁺ stores and from the external medium, respectively. It is well-established that prolonged fluid secretion is regulated via a sustained elevation in [Ca²⁺]i that is primarily achieved by the influx of Ca²⁺ into the cell from the external medium. This Ca²⁺ influx occurs via a putative plasma-membrane-store-operated Ca²⁺ channel which has not yet been identified in any non-excitable cell type. Understanding the molecular nature of this Ca²⁺ influx mechanism is critical to our understanding of Ca²⁺ signaling in salivary gland cells. This review focuses on the various active and passive Ca²⁺ transport mechanisms in salivary gland cells—their localization, regulation, and role in neurotransmitter-regulation of fluid secretion. In addition to a historical perspective of Ca²⁺ signaling, recent findings and challenging problems facing this field are highlighted.

### (1.0) Introduction

The primary function of salivary glands is to secrete saliva, a fluid composed of electrolytes, water, and a variety of proteins. Under normal physiologic conditions, salivary glands maintain a continuous low level of saliva flow, often referred to as "resting" or "basal" secretion, which is dramatically increased upon demand, *i.e.*, during a meal or other masticatory and gustatory stimuli (Schneyer and Emmelin, 1974; Garrett, 1982; Baum, 1987). The regulation of secretion in the salivary glands is achieved by autonomic sympathetic and parasympathetic stimuli via a coordinated sequence of signal transduction and intracellular signaling events. These events include activation of membrane receptors and associated signal transduction proteins in the plasma membrane, generation of intracellular second messengers, calcium mobilization, and stimulation of ion transport pathways (Putney, 1986a,b; Baum, 1987, 1993; Petersen and Gallacher, 1988; Baum and Ambudkar, 1988; Baum *et al.*, 1993; Cook *et al.*, 1994; Petersen *et al.*, 1994).

Ca²⁺ has a pivotal role in the physiologic function of both excitable and non-excitable cells. There is sufficient evidence to establish that Ca²⁺ is the primary intracellular factor in the regulation of fluid secretion in salivary, and other exocrine, gland cells (Putney, 1986a; Petersen and Gallacher, 1988; Baum *et al.*, 1993; Cook *et al.*, 1994; Petersen *et al.*, 1994). This review will focus on our current understanding of the regulation of Ca²⁺ in salivary gland cells during fluid secretion and will briefly discuss the role of Ca²⁺ in fluid secretion. In recent years, a large number of studies has been reported describing the regulation of various ion transport and ion channel mechanisms in salivary gland cells (for reviews, see Petersen, 1992; Turner, 1993a,b; Cook *et al.*, 1994; Petersen *et al.*, 1994), but there have been relatively fewer reports

The basic processes that are initiated downstream from the interaction of the agonist with its receptor on the basolateral plasma membrane are shown.

regarding the mechanisms involved in the regulation of cytosolic [Ca²⁺] ([Ca²⁺]i) (Baum and Ambudkar, 1988; Ambudkar et al., 1992, 1993; Nauntofte, 1992; Baum et al., 1993; Petersen et al., 1994). Historically, salivary glands from various sources have been widely used in earlier studies of neurotransmitter-stimulated signaling mechanisms (Mitchell, 1975; Berridge et al., 1983; Berridge and Irvine, 1984; Petersen, 1992). These previous studies demonstrate that the mechanism(s) of Ca²⁺ signaling in salivary gland cells is similar to that in other non-excitable cells. Thus, studies toward our understanding of some fundamental, as yet unknown, mechanisms of Ca²⁺ signaling in salivary glands are likely to have a more global consequence to the field of Ca²⁺ signaling, and vice versa. This review will discuss some of the challenging issues that face investigators in this field.

In the following sections, the fundamental mechanisms involved in fluid secretion will be described, and a historical perspective on the role of Ca²⁺ signaling in

salivary gland fluid secretion will be presented. A major part of the review will focus on the various active and passive Ca²⁺ transport mechanisms in salivary gland cells—their localization, regulation, and role in the physiologic response. Since the basic Ca²⁺ homeostatic mechanisms in salivary glands are similar to those in various non-excitable cell types, studies with other cell types, that have been useful in clarifying certain mechanisms in salivary gland cells or for proposing a testable hypothesis, will be discussed.

(2.0) Receptor-mediated Signaling Mechanisms

Saliva is critical to the health of the oral cavity (Mandel, 1989). The “basal,” or “resting,” saliva flow allows the teeth and oral tissues to be continuously bathed in saliva. Pathophysiologic conditions which result in a loss or decrease in this basal secretion result in a “dry mouth” condition which is associated with a number of complications, such as an increase in caries and fungal infections.

tions (Atkinson and Fox, 1992). However, the physiologic mechanisms which regulate the low “basal” saliva flow are not well-understood. It is widely believed that this secretion is due to a submaximal stimulation of the gland by a low level of the neurotransmitter(s), likely released by the nerves innervating the gland, although “spontaneous” secretion has been described in some animals, *e.g.*, sheep (Cook *et al.*, 1994). The exact type of neurotransmitter involved in this “basal” regulatory process is not yet known. More is known about the up-regulation of fluid secretion that takes place when salivary glands respond to stimuli such as electrical stimulation, exposure to neurotransmitters, mastication, smell, or taste. Under these conditions, there is an increase in the level of stimulation of the gland, likely by an increase in the amount of neurotransmitter released in the vicinity of the gland.

Salivary glands have a highly specialized structure which is composed of two major types of epithelial cells, the acinar cells and the ductal cells. The salivary gland acinar cells form the secretory end-pieces of the gland, while the various ductal cells form the conduits for the flow of saliva from the site of secretion into the oral cavity (for reviews on the morphology of the salivary glands, see Young and Van Lennep, 1978; Denny *et al.*, 1997). Both the acinar and ductal cells are polarized, which facilitates the vectorial flow of electrolytes and water. Fluid secretion and Ca²⁺ signaling have been studied in salivary glands—such as the parotid, submandibular, and sublingual—from a number of different species, such as the rat, mouse, rabbit, sheep, guinea pig, and insect. Although these glands are distinct in terms of their morphology and salivary components, the acinar cells are the primary site for fluid secretion in all of them, while the ductal cells mainly serve to modify the primary saliva by re-absorbing or secreting salts (Cook *et al.*, 1994). Acinar cells and ductal cells have distinct functions with regard to fluid secretion, but the basic mechanism of Ca²⁺ signaling (*i.e.*, receptor-stimulation of the inositol-phosphate metabolism) in both cells is similar (O’Connell *et al.*, 1999). This review will focus primarily on the acinar cells and the events pertaining to the regulation of fluid secretion.

Salivary gland cells have receptors, for a number of neurotransmitters, which are localized in the basolateral membrane of the cell and possess extracellular binding sites which are specific for their respective ligands (Schneyer and Emmelin, 1974; Garrett, 1982; Putney, 1986a; Baum, 1987; Nauntofte, 1992; Petersen, 1992; Baum *et al.*, 1993). The major receptors which regulate protein and fluid secretion belong to the G-protein coupled receptor family (GPCR). Unlike exocrine glands such as the pancreas, protein and fluid secretion in salivary glands are regulated by distinct signal transduction mechanisms. Muscarinic-cholinergic receptors and α₁-adrenergic receptors are the major GPCR which regulate fluid secretion in acinar cells (see Fig. 1). Stimulation of these receptors induces increases in fluid secretion via activation of intracellular calcium signaling mechanisms (Putney, 1986a; Ek and Nahorski, 1988; Ambudkar *et al.*, 1988; Baum *et al.*, 1993; Putney and Bird, 1993a; Cook *et al.*, 1994; Petersen *et al.*, 1994). Other receptors, such as those for ATP and Substance P, are also coupled to Ca²⁺ signaling mechanisms, but their role in sustained fluid secretion is poorly understood (Amsallem *et al.*, 1996; Soltoff *et al.*, 1990; Cook *et al.*, 1994). It is well-established that stimulation of β-adrenergic receptors induces an increase in protein secretion, which is believed to be mainly regulated by cyclic AMP-dependent processes (Schramm and Selinger, 1974; Takuma, 1990). Salivary proteins are packaged in secretory granules which are localized in the apical region of the cells, and following β-adrenergic receptor stimulation, exocytosis is stimulated via the luminal membrane, which induces the release of proteins into the luminal space of the acinus (Takuma, 1990; Quissell *et al.*, 1992; Castle and Castle, 1996, 1998). A recent report demonstrates that secretory granules contain a high amount of Ca²⁺ (Martinez *et al.*, 1996) which is released into the extracellular medium following stimulation of the cells with isoproterenol (Belan *et al.*, 1998). However, the exact mechanisms involved in exocytosis and protein secretion in salivary glands are not clearly understood and will not be addressed in this review.

The following sections will focus on the key event which regulates fluid secretion in the salivary gland acinar cell, *i.e.*, agonist-stimulated Ca²⁺ mobilization (see Fig. 1). While, as mentioned above, several receptors stimulate Ca²⁺ mobilization events in the salivary gland acinar cells, relatively more information is available regarding muscarinic-receptor-stimulated events. An earlier study demonstrated that, in rat parotid acinar cells, only the m₃-muscarinic receptor is present (Dai *et al.*, 1991), which is coupled to two signaling systems—*i.e.*, Ca²⁺ and cAMP. The m₃-receptor in rat parotid acinar cells is coupled to adenyl cyclase via Gᵢ (inhibitory G-protein), and upon stimulation with an agonist such as carbachol (Cch), results in activation of Gᵢ and inhibition of cAMP generation. It should be noted that this is a unique interaction, since Gᵢ activation is usually mediated by the m₂-muscarinic receptor. Stimulation of the m₃ receptor by the agonist, carbachol, also activates the Ca²⁺ signaling cascade (further described below). Muscarinic receptor subtypes have also been detected in mouse parotid and submandibular glands, where both m₁ and m₃ muscarinic receptors have been identified. Both receptors regulate cAMP and Ca²⁺ (Culp *et al.*, 1996; Watson *et al.*, 1996).

Further studies have shown that m<sub>3</sub>-muscarinic receptor activation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling is mediated via the G<sub>αq/11</sub> family of G-proteins (Sawaki et al., 1993). Agonist binding to either the m<sub>3</sub>-muscarinic or α<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic receptor results in the activation of G<sub>αq/11</sub>, which then interacts with and activates a phosphatidylinositol 1,4,bisphosphate (PIP<sub>2</sub>)-specific phospholipase C enzyme (PLC). The PLC subtype in rat parotid glands was identified as PLCβ<sub>3</sub> (Sawaki et al., 1995). The activation of PLCβ<sub>3</sub> leads to the hydrolysis of a membrane-bound phospholipid, PIP<sub>2</sub>, resulting in two metabolites, water-soluble inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP<sub>3</sub>) and a membrane lipid, diacylglycerol (DAG). It is known that DAG is mainly involved in the regulation of protein kinase C (Berridge and Irvine, 1989; Nishizuka, 1984; Berridge, 1993). Presently, there is relatively little information regarding the regulation of protein kinase C in salivary gland acinar cells and its role in fluid secretion. On the other hand, there are sufficient studies which establish that IP<sub>3</sub> is the primary intracellular messenger in the stimulation of fluid secretion, since it initiates the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-signaling cascade (Berridge and Irvine, 1989; Baum et al., 1993; Berridge, 1993; Putney and Bird, 1993a). IP<sub>3</sub> diffuses into the cytosol and binds to the IP<sub>3</sub> receptor (IP<sub>3</sub>R), a 260-kDa glycoprotein, which is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This results in the release of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> store(s) via the IP<sub>3</sub>R itself, which has been identified as a Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel (Ferris et al., 1989; Bezprozvanny et al., 1991; Mikoshiba, 1993). Three subtypes of the IP<sub>3</sub> receptor have been described (IP<sub>3</sub>R1, IP<sub>3</sub>R2, and IP<sub>3</sub>R3; see Mikoshiba, 1993). It has been reported that IP<sub>3</sub>R subtypes 1, 2, and 3 are localized in the apical and lateral regions of rat parotid and submandibular gland acinar cells (Lee et al., 1997a,b), and it has been suggested that this localization of IP<sub>3</sub>R has a functional consequence. In pancreatic acinar cells, internal Ca<sup>2+</sup> release has been reported to originate in the luminal region of the cell (Petersen et al., 1994; Lee et al., 1997a,b). Similarly, recent studies in salivary gland acinar cells suggest that the pattern of Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves induced by carbachol might be related to the distribution of the IP<sub>3</sub>Rs and the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup> pump SERCA (Lee et al., 1997a,b; Tojyo et al., 1997). The net result of the IP<sub>3</sub>-induced release of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the ER is an increase in the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>, which is the triggering event in the stimulation and sustained regulation of fluid secretion.

the luminal membrane (for reviews, see Petersen, 1992; Turner, 1993a,b; Cook et al., 1994; Petersen et al., 1994; also see Fig. 1). Earlier studies established that activation of a K<sup>+</sup> channel accompanies the increase in fluid secretion from several salivary glands. These studies utilized isotopic Rb<sup>+</sup> as a substitute for K<sup>+</sup> and demonstrated an increase in the release of Rb<sup>+</sup> following stimulation of salivary glands with an agonist in several experimental systems, such as intact tissue perfusion, tissue slices, as well as in dispersed cell preparations (Batzri et al., 1973; Putney, 1976a,b, 1983, 1986a; Marier et al., 1978; Petersen, 1992). These studies suggested that the K<sup>+</sup> channel has a major role in the salivary gland physiology, since it sets the membrane potential of the cell (Nauntofte, 1992; Cook et al., 1994; Petersen et al., 1994). The first direct demonstration of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> current was made in mouse and rat salivary gland cells (Maruyama et al., 1983; also see Petersen and Gallacher, 1988, and Petersen, 1992, for detailed reviews).

The K<sup>+</sup> channel in rat parotid acinar cells is a charybdotoxin-sensitive maxi-K<sup>+</sup> channel which is activated by Ca<sup>2+</sup> and regulated by membrane potential (Nauntofte, 1992; Cook et al., 1994). Following agonist stimulation of the rat salivary gland acinar cell, the elevation of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> results in the activation of the K<sup>+</sup> channel, the efflux of K<sup>+</sup> from the cell, and, under normal conditions, hyperpolarization of the cell. Thus, the activity of the K<sup>+</sup> channel has been effectively used as a read-out for [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>. Recently, we (Liu et al., 1998a) and others (Nauntofte, 1992; Izutsu et al., 1994; Petersen et al., 1994; Hayashi et al., 1996) have reported that the K<sup>+</sup> channel activity, i.e., a hyperpolarization response which is measured as an outward current in the whole-cell patch-clamp protocols, undergoes oscillations which are correlated with oscillatory changes in cytosolic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>. Further, the sustained increase in the K<sup>+</sup> current in human submandibular gland cells, HSG, is dependent on Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx (Liu et al., 1998a).

The elevation of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> also activates a Cl<sup>−</sup> channel in the luminal membrane, which mediates the efflux of Cl<sup>−</sup> from the cytosol into the luminal space of the acinus (Cook et al., 1994; Petersen et al., 1994). This ion channel has also been studied by means of isotopic techniques (<sup>36</sup>Cl<sup>−</sup> flux experiments) as well as by patch-clamp techniques (Iwatsuki et al., 1985; Martinez and Cassity, 1985; Ambudkar et al., 1988; Melvin et al., 1989; Ishikawa and Cook, 1993). Cl<sup>−</sup> efflux via the channel is monitored as an inward current, or depolarization of the cell. Several studies have established that the Cl<sup>−</sup> efflux from the cell can be correlated with K<sup>+</sup> efflux and fluid secretion. Furthermore, like the K<sup>+</sup> channel, changes in the Cl<sup>−</sup> flux also reflect underlying changes in the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> (Foskett, 1990; Petersen, 1992). Melvin and co-workers have reported a comprehensive characterization of the Cl<sup>−</sup> channels in acinar cells (Arreola et al., 1996a,b). Using

(3.0) Ion Fluxes and the Regulation of Fluid Secretion

Fluid secretion in salivary acinar cells is driven by an osmotic gradient which is established by the concerted activities of a number of ion transporters and ion channels, such as the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> channel, the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase, and the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>/2Cl<sup>−</sup> co-transporter in the basolateral membrane and the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl<sup>−</sup> channel in
patch-clamp techniques, they demonstrated a cooperative effect of Ca²⁺ on the Cl⁻ channel activity.

Current models for fluid secretion in the salivary gland cells suggest that the accumulation of Cl⁻ in the lumen drives Na⁺ into the lumen via the intercellular tight junctions (Turner, 1993a,b; Cook et al., 1994; Petersen et al., 1994; also see Fig. 1). The osmotic gradient created by the [NaCl] in the lumen drives the flux of water from the cell into the lumen. Water movement in a number of epithelial cells has been recently suggested to be mediated via the aquaporin family of water channel proteins (King and Agre, 1996). The function of aquaporin in salivary gland fluid secretion is not yet known, although AQP5 has been found in salivary glands (King et al., 1997).

Salivary acinar cells maintain stimulated levels of fluid secretion for prolonged time periods, and this is mainly accomplished via a sustained elevation of [Ca²⁺]i and the resulting activation of the Cl⁻ and K⁺ channels. Continuous efflux of Cl⁻ across the luminal membrane is dependent on the activity of the Na⁺/K⁺/2Cl⁻ co-transporter in the basolateral membrane, which mediates the influx of Cl⁻ from the external medium to maintain intracellular [Cl⁻] (Nauntofte, 1992; Petersen, 1992; Turner, 1993a,b; Cook et al., 1994). Thus, the acinar cell accomplishes a continuous transcellular flux of Cl⁻ from the extracellular milieu of the basolateral region of the cell into the lumen. The Cl⁻ channel activity is functionally coupled to the K⁺ channel as well as to the Na⁺/K⁺/2Cl⁻ co-transporter. Furthermore, all three ion transport mechanisms are regulated by the same intracellular messenger, Ca²⁺. It has been recently reported that the Na⁺/K⁺/2Cl⁻ co-transporter is up-regulated by a Ca²⁺-dependent mechanism following stimulation of rat parotid acinar cell with carbachol (Evans and Turner, 1997). Thus, the regulation of [Ca²⁺]i in salivary gland cells and the coordinated regulation of the various ion transport mechanisms under unstimulated and stimulated conditions are of primary importance to the physiologic function of these cells. The following sections of this review will focus on the mechanisms involved in the regulation of Ca²⁺ homeostasis in salivary gland acinar cells (for earlier reviews on this subject, see Putney, 1986a,b; Ambudkar et al., 1992, 1993; Baum et al., 1993).

also obtained for Rb⁺ efflux (Putney, 1976a,b, 1978, 1983, 1986a; Aub et al., 1982). Increase in Rb⁺ efflux from the cells was biphasic, with an initial rapid transient increase which was independent of external Ca²⁺, and a lower sustained release which was completely dependent on external [Ca²⁺]. More direct involvement of Ca²⁺ in salivary gland physiology was first demonstrated in studies showing a flux of Ca²⁺ following stimulation of salivary gland cells with muscarinic and α₁-adrenergic receptor agonists. These studies showed an increase in the rate of Ca²⁺ uptake as well as that of Ca²⁺ release (Nielsen and Petersen, 1972; Putney, 1976b; Poggioli and Putney, 1982). Thus, it was proposed that intracellular Ca²⁺ homeostasis was altered and the Ca²⁺ permeability of the cell membrane was increased following agonist stimulation of salivary gland cells. Several studies, in aggregate, suggested that the release of Ca²⁺ from the cell was temporally associated with the release of K⁺ and the increase in fluid secretion, while Ca²⁺ uptake was associated with prolonged fluid secretion (Putney, 1986a; Aub et al., 1982; Petersen and Gallacher, 1988; Baum et al., 1993; Petersen et al., 1994). Experiments where isotopic Ca²⁺ was used to monitor Ca²⁺ flux in salivary cells indicated that Ca²⁺ was sequestered in an intracellular organelle (referred to as the internal Ca²⁺ store) from which it was released following stimulation (Aub et al., 1982; Putney, 1986a,b; Muallem et al., 1988). This was further confirmed by experiments with permeabilized cells which demonstrated the presence of an ATP-dependent Ca²⁺ uptake mechanism and a Ca²⁺ store in the ER of exocrine gland cells (Berridge and Irvine, 1984; Muallem, 1989).

A landmark in the field of Ca²⁺ signaling was the finding that IP₃ released Ca²⁺ from ER Ca²⁺ store(s) (Streb et al., 1983). This study was accomplished in permeabilized pancreatic acinar cells and linked together two apparently unconnected observations, namely, the increase in inositol lipid turnover following agonist stimulation (Mitchell, 1975; Berridge et al., 1983) and intracellular Ca²⁺ mobilization (Nielsen and Petersen, 1972; Aub et al., 1982). This finding was critical to our present understanding of the receptor-stimulated Ca²⁺ signaling cascade in various non-excitable cells. Based on these data, two important suggestions were made:

(i) Following cell stimulation, internal Ca²⁺ stores are mobilized by IP₃, and the resulting depletion of the internal Ca²⁺ store regulates Ca²⁺ influx—i.e., the capacitative Ca²⁺ influx hypothesis.

(ii) Ca²⁺ influx occurs without elevation of [Ca²⁺]i (Putney, 1986b; Muallem, 1989; Mertz et al., 1990b).

The introduction of fluorescent probes for the measurement of free cytosolic [Ca²⁺]i in the early 1980s revolutionized the field of Ca²⁺ signaling (Tsien et al., 1982; Tsien and Poenie, 1986). The use of these dyes not only

(4.0) **A Historical Perspective of Ca²⁺ Signaling in Salivary Acinar Cells**

Studies reported by Douglas and Poisner as early as 1963 showed that Ca²⁺ was involved in the regulation of fluid secretion in the salivary gland. Using perfused cat salivary glands, these investigators demonstrated that sustained fluid secretion was achieved only when Ca²⁺ was present in the external medium, while in the absence of external Ca²⁺, fluid secretion was stimulated only transiently (Douglas and Poisner, 1963). Similar results were
confirmed the previous suggestions which were made regarding Ca²⁺ mobilization events in the salivary glands but also clearly established the sequence of these events at a cellular level. Studies where these dyes were used to monitor neurotransmitter-induced changes in [Ca²⁺]i rapidly increased the available information regarding the process of Ca²⁺ signaling in salivary gland cells and numerous other cell types as well. A primary observation made in these studies was that stimulation of the cells with the agonists induced a biphasic increase in [Ca²⁺]i (Helman et al., 1987; Merritt and Rink, 1987; Nauntofte and Dissing, 1987; Ambudkar et al., 1988; Baum and Ambudkar, 1988; Mertz et al., 1990a,b), with an initial rapid increase in [Ca²⁺]i which was transient and decreased to a lower, more sustained, elevation. It was further reported that the initial increase in Ca²⁺ was not altered by removal of Ca²⁺ from the external medium, suggesting that it was primarily due to release from an internal Ca²⁺ store (Merrittt and Rink, 1987; Takemura and Putney, 1989; Mertz et al., 1990a; Ambudkar et al., 1992). The subsequent, sustained, increase in [Ca²⁺]i was completely dependent on the presence of external Ca²⁺ and could be inhibited by the addition of La³⁺ (a blocker of Ca²⁺ influx) or Ca²⁺ chelators to the external medium. These results suggested that the second phase of Ca²⁺ increase was due to Ca²⁺ influx into the cell from the external medium. The pattern of [Ca²⁺]i increase and the dependence on external Ca²⁺ was consistent with the earlier studies describing ⁴⁵Ca²⁺ and ⁸⁶Rb⁺ release from salivary gland cells and, more importantly, was consistent with the role of Ca²⁺ mobilization in fluid secretion. These studies firmly established that while fluid secretion (Rb⁺ and Cl⁻ efflux) could be stimulated by intracellular Ca²⁺ release, prolonged fluid secretion was dependent on the sustained elevation in [Ca²⁺]i which was achieved primarily by Ca²⁺ influx (Putney, 1986a,b; Mertz et al., 1990a; Melvin et al., 1991; Ambudkar et al., 1992, 1993; Petersen, 1992; Cook et al., 1994). More recent studies have demonstrated that the sustained activation of the three ion flux systems regulating fluid secretion—namely, the K⁺ channel, the Na⁺/K⁺/Cl⁻ co-transporter, and the Cl⁻ channel—are all dependent on Ca²⁺ influx. Whether water movement, via the putative aquaporin channels, is also directly regulated by Ca²⁺ is yet to be established (Ishikawa et al., 1998). Thus, Ca²⁺ influx is of primary importance to the regulation of fluid secretion in the salivary gland acinar cell.

(Carafoli, 1987; Muallem, 1989; Baum et al., 1993). In addition, Ca²⁺-binding proteins such as calmodulin, calreticulin, and other glycoproteins mediate a variety of Ca²⁺-dependent processes and also likely provide a buffer for Ca²⁺ in the various intracellular organelles and in the cytosol (Petersen et al., 1994; Clapham, 1995; Berridge, 1997). [Ca²⁺]i in resting cells is maintained at around 100 nM, while external [Ca²⁺] is estimated to be about 1.2 mM to 2.0 mM. Thus, to maintain a low [Ca²⁺]i, the cell has to work against a high driving force for Ca²⁺ influx. This is primarily achieved via the activity of the Ca²⁺ pump in the plasma membrane and in the ER, which serve to remove Ca²⁺ from the cytosol and pump it either out of the cell or into the ER, respectively (Baum and Ambudkar, 1988; Muallem, 1989; Baum et al., 1993). Conversely, influx of Ca²⁺ into the cytosol is a passive process driven by the electrochemical gradient for Ca²⁺. Ca²⁺ influx is mediated by Ca²⁺ channels in the ER and in the plasma membrane, i.e., the well-characterized IP₃-sensitive Ca²⁺ channel and the putative capacitative Ca²⁺ entry channel, respectively.

(5.1) THE SARCO-ENDOPLASMIC RETICULUM CA²⁺ PUMP

The sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca²⁺ pump, referred to as SERCA, exists as three isoforms: SERCA2a, SERCA2b, and SERCA 3 (Wu et al., 1995). SERCA2a is primarily found in smooth muscle and excitable cells, while SERCA 2b is preferentially localized in the ER of non-excitable cells. Recently, SERCA3 and SERCA 2b have been shown to be present in salivary gland cells (Lee et al., 1997b; Meehan et al., 1997). The primary function of the SERCA appears to be the refilling of the ER Ca²⁺ stores (Takemura et al., 1989). The activity of SERCA has been studied in isolated ER vesicles and in permeabilized and intact cells (Baum and Ambudkar, 1988; Baum et al., 1988, 1993; Muallem, 1989). Earlier studies with ER vesicles showed that the SERCA has a relatively high affinity for Ca²⁺ (Kd is about 30 nM) and reaches Vmax at about 100 nM Ca²⁺ (Baum et al., 1988). Thus, it was suggested that the SERCA pump functions at Vmax even under resting conditions, consistent with reports showing that the pump can accumulate Ca²⁺ into the store even at very low [Ca²⁺]i, as occurs during refill of internal Ca²⁺ stores (Putney, 1986a,b; Baum and Ambudkar, 1988; Muallem, 1989; Mertz et al., 1990b). Recent studies with intact pancreatic acinar cells show that upon depletion of the internal Ca²⁺ store, there is an increase in the pump rate (Mogami et al., 1998). These results are also consistent with previous suggestions that the turnover of the ER Ca²⁺ pool is increased several-fold following agonist stimulation of acinar cells (Muallem et al., 1988; Muallem, 1989). Thus, it appears that the [Ca²⁺] in the ER lumen may also have a role in the regulation of the SERCA activity. It is well-established that the Ca²⁺-accumulation

(5.0) Calcium Stores and Calcium Transporters

Regulation of [Ca²⁺]i in salivary gland cells is typical of that in many non-excitable cell types and is achieved via the concerted activities of several Ca²⁺ channels and Ca²⁺ pumps localized in the various cellular membranes

mulating capacity of the ER is increased several-fold in
the presence of an anion-like phosphate or oxalate, likely by compensation for the charge contributed by the
influx of Ca²⁺ into the ER (Ambudkar and Baum, 1988; 
Baum *et al.*, 1988). In the presence of phosphate or
oxalate, the Ca²⁺ pump appears to have a higher initial
rate and saturates at higher [Ca²⁺]. Effects due to the
accompanying anion flux might account for the relatively
lower affinity of the SERCA for Ca²⁺ that has been estimated from studies with permeabilized cells or intact
acini (Muallem, 1989; Camello *et al.*, 1995). Under physiological conditions, it is most likely that anion flux into the
ER accompanies Ca²⁺ uptake, although not mediated via
the SERCA. Notably, there is no information regarding
the anion permeabilities in the ER membrane of non-
excitable cells. Thus, the exact mechanisms regulating
the SERCA-dependent Ca²⁺ accumulation are not yet
clearly understood. However, the studies reported to
date clearly demonstrate that the SERCA pump can efficiently pump Ca²⁺ into the ER within the range of [Ca²⁺]
induced in the ER and cytosol following stimulation of
the cells (Baum and Ambudkar, 1988; Baum *et al.*, 1988;
Muallem, 1989; Camello *et al.*, 1995; Mogami *et al.*, 1998).
As discussed above, the SERCA activity is regulated by
the increase in cytosolic [Ca²⁺] as well as by the decrease
in the luminal Ca²⁺. This regulation is consistent with the
role for the SERCA activity during cytosolic Ca²⁺ oscillations which have been observed in a number of exocrine
gland cells (Petersen *et al.*, 1994; Berridge, 1997).

(5.2) THE ER CALCIUM STORE

There is a large buffering capacity for Ca²⁺ in the ER
lumen, which has been suggested to be provided by
Ca²⁺-binding proteins. While the exact proteins involved
in this process are not yet known, calreticulin is believed
to play a major role. Cells overexpressing the calreticulin
protein display a decrease in the rate of Ca²⁺ mobilization from the internal stores, consistent with its role as a
Ca²⁺ buffer (Camacho and Lechleiter, 1995; Van de Put
and Elliott, 1997). Other proteins in the ER, such as the
glucose-regulated proteins (GRP) and other chaperone
proteins, might also be involved in determining the status of luminal Ca²⁺. Recent studies have been directed
toward measuring the free [Ca²⁺] in the ER lumen
(Montero *et al.*, 1995; Van de Put and Elliott, 1997;
Mogami *et al.*, 1998) by a variety of methods, including
fluorescence (mag-fura) and luminescence (aequorin).
Although there are considerable inconsistencies in the
data from different laboratories and different cells, a
range of values has been obtained, from 70 μM to > 300
μM. Thus, it is clear that the free [Ca²⁺] in the lumen is
much higher than [Ca²⁺]i, while total [Ca²⁺] in the ER
lumen is likely to be in the mM range (Muallem, 1989;
Clapham, 1995).

The Ca²⁺ content in the ER stores is also involved in
other aspects of cellular function. Persistent depletion of
the store alters protein synthesis and cell proliferation.
These effects have been demonstrated in several cell
types, including NIH3T3 and DDT1 smooth-muscle cells
(Ghosh *et al.*, 1991; Means, 1994), and by us in HSG cells
(Wu *et al.*, 1996; Meehan *et al.*, 1997). We have reported
that treatment of HSG cells with thapsigargin, a SERCA
inhibitor which allows the intracellular Ca²⁺ stores to be
depleted, induces cell-cycle arrest and loss of proliferation (Wu *et al.*, 1996). Notably, thapsigargin has been
reported to induce apoptosis in several other cell types
(Means, 1994). Whether internal Ca²⁺ store depletion
also induces apoptosis is still unclear in HSG cells.

(5.3) THE PLASMA MEMBRANE CA²⁺ PUMP

Increases in cytosolic Ca²⁺ activate a Ca²⁺ pump, located
in the basolateral plasma membrane of salivary gland
acinar cells, which mediates the ATP-dependent extrusion of Ca²⁺ from the cells (Ambudkar and Baum, 1988;
Ambudkar *et al.*, 1989). The plasma membrane Ca²⁺
pump, often referred to as PMCA, is the major Ca²⁺ efflux
pathway in parotid acinar cells. Although a Na⁺/Ca²⁺
exchanger has been reported in this membrane, it does
not contribute significantly to the regulation of [Ca²⁺]i
(Baum and Ambudkar, 1988). Using isolated basolateral
plasma membrane vesicles (BLMV), we characterized the
activity of the PMCA in rat parotid acinar cells. This Ca²⁺
pump has a lower affinity for Ca²⁺ than the SERCA. Its Kd
for Ca²⁺ was determined to be around 100 nM, and the
activity was saturated at [Ca²⁺] > 500 nM (Ambudkar and
Baum, 1988). Furthermore, the activity of the PMCA was
regulated by calmodulin (CAM), and, in the presence of
CAM, the affinity for Ca²⁺ was increased (Kd decreased
from 100 nM to 30 nM). Thus, the Ca²⁺-dependent activation of PMCA is exerted directly and via an interaction
with CAM (Ambudkar *et al.*, 1989). In addition, the PMCA
activity is sensitive to changes in the membrane potential and pH (Ambudkar and Baum, 1988).

Based on our studies with PMCA and SERCA, we had
suggested that [Ca²⁺]i increases following activation of
the cell by an agonist would result in the activation of
PMCA and stimulation of Ca²⁺ from the cell (Baum and
Ambudkar, 1988; Ambudkar *et al.*, 1989). We proposed
that the PMCA has a more significant role in regulating
[Ca²⁺]i in an activated cell, i.e., when [Ca²⁺]i is higher,
while the SERCA, due to its very high affinity for Ca²⁺, is
more effective at lower [Ca²⁺]i. However, the calmodulin
regulation of the PMCA suggests that this pump can also
be activated at lower [Ca²⁺]i. Recently, data consistent
with our in vitro studies have been reported by Petersen
and co-workers (Camello *et al.*, 1995). Using intact pancreatic acini, these investigators estimated the PMCA
activity and reported that the PMCA is activated at [Ca²⁺]i

around 200 nM and is saturated at \([Ca^{2+}]_{i}\) around 700 nM. Further, these investigators also reported that the activation of the PMCA reflects the increase in \([Ca^{2+}]_{i}\), *i.e.*, the rate of extrusion is highest when peak \([Ca^{2+}]_{i}\) is reached following IP₃-dependent internal \(Ca^{2+}\) release. Thus, the kinetic properties associated with PMCA in acinar cells appear to be well-suited for its physiologic role in \(Ca^{2+}\) extrusion.

(5.4) THE IP₃-SENSITIVE CA²⁺ CHANNEL

The best-characterized \(Ca^{2+}\) channel in non-excitable cells is the IP₃-sensitive \(Ca^{2+}\) channel in the ER, which allows \(Ca^{2+}\) to be rapidly released from the ER \(Ca^{2+}\) stores into the cytosol (Mikoshiba, 1993). The free \([Ca^{2+}]\) in the ER lumen is estimated to be between 70 μM and > 300 μM, thus providing a large driving force for \(Ca^{2+}\) release from this pool. Although considerable buffering of \(Ca^{2+}\) has been suggested to be present within the ER lumen (see above section), it does not appear to hinder the process of \(Ca^{2+}\) release. It is possible that there are subdomains within this \(Ca^{2+}\) store where the extent or type of buffering of \(Ca^{2+}\) varies so that rapid release of \(Ca^{2+}\) can be facilitated. It has also been proposed, in studies with the isolated IP₃ receptor, that chaperone proteins in the lumen of the ER, such as the FK506-binding protein (FKBP) or calreticulin, might modulate the activity of this channel. Interactions of the IP₃R with calreticulin, calmodulin, and cytoskeletal elements have also been suggested (Mikoshiba, 1993; Clapham, 1995). Thus, this channel appears to be regulated in a complex way by a number of different factors. There are no data regarding the regulation of this channel in salivary gland cells, except for two studies describing the regulation of the IP₃ receptor by \(Ca^{2+}\) in a human salivary gland cell line, HSY (Tanimura and Turner, 1996a,b).

The IP₃ receptor is a 260-kDa protein and requires the formation of a tetramer for function. The protein has a very long N-terminal domain which projects into the cytoplasm and contains the IP₃-binding site. The C terminal half of the protein contains the membrane-spanning domains. Three isoforms have been identified and have been named IP₃R1, IP₃R2, and IP₃R3 (Marshall and Taylor, 1993; Mikoshiba, 1993). All three isoforms have been found to be present in salivary gland acinar cells (Lee et al., 1997a), and they appear to be concentrated in the luminal end of the cell. This localization is consistent with data showing that, following agonist stimulation, a rise in \([Ca^{2+}]_{i}\) occurs first at the luminal pole of the cell.

An interesting observation that provoked much discussion was the graded or "quantal" release of \(Ca^{2+}\) from the ER at any given concentration of agonist or IP₃ (Muallem et al., 1989). This study demonstrated that \(Ca^{2+}\) was not continuously released from the ER, even in the continued presence of IP₃. IP₃R with various sensitivities for IP₃ and \(Ca^{2+}\) stores with various amounts of \(Ca^{2+}\) have

been suggested to account for the quantal nature of the internal \(Ca^{2+}\) release process. Another possible explanation is that the IP₃ receptor does not remain continuously activated. The quantal pattern of \(Ca^{2+}\) release can also be accounted for by the regulation of the IP₃R by IP₃ and \(Ca^{2+}\), which has been studied in great detail (Berridge and Irvine, 1989; Bezprozvanny et al., 1991; Berridge, 1993, 1997; Marshall and Taylor, 1993; Mikoshiba, 1993). It has been well-established that \(Ca^{2+}\) stimulates IP₃-mediated \(Ca^{2+}\) release at lower concentrations and inhibits at higher concentrations, > 300 nM. The ability of \(Ca^{2+}\) to increase \(Ca^{2+}\) release is completely dependent on the IP₃ level. As the IP₃ concentration increases, the receptor becomes more sensitive to lower \([Ca^{2+}]\). This biphasic regulation of the IP₃R by \(Ca^{2+}\) ensures an open state of the channel when \([Ca^{2+}]_{i}\) is low, whereas when cytosolic \(Ca^{2+}\) levels are high, release from the ER \(Ca^{2+}\) store is restricted. In addition, it has also been suggested that the \([Ca^{2+}]\) within the ER store also regulates the permeability of the IP₃-sensitive \(Ca^{2+}\) channel. In permeabilized HSY cells, depletion of the ER \(Ca^{2+}\) store induces the channel to be in a low activity state (Tanimura and Turner, 1996a). However, the molecular mechanism(s) involved in the regulation of the IP₃ receptor by luminal \([Ca^{2+}]\) is not well-understood. Regardless of the mechanism, such a regulation provides a \(Ca^{2+}\) sensing process by which the ER \(Ca^{2+}\) stores can be protected and \([Ca^{2+}]_{i}\) can be tightly regulated within the range required for the physiologic function of the cell. As discussed in the above section, depletion of the ER stores can lead to severe effects on protein synthesis, cell proliferation, and cell death.

(5.5) THE CA²⁺ INFLUX MECHANISM

Although evidence for the involvement of \(Ca^{2+}\) influx in salivary fluid secretion was provided almost 35 years ago (Douglas and Poisner, 1963), the molecular mechanism(s) involved in regulating this process remains a challenging problem facing investigators not only in the field of salivary gland physiology but also in the field of \(Ca^{2+}\) signaling in all other non-excitable cells (Putney, 1986b; Irvine, 1990; Ambudkar et al., 1992, 1993; Baum et al., 1993; Putney and Bird, 1993a,b; Berridge, 1995, 1996, 1997; Clapham, 1995; Parekh and Penner, 1997). Interestingly, some of the earliest studies of \(Ca^{2+}\) influx were performed with salivary gland cells, and the capacitative \(Ca^{2+}\) influx hypothesis first put forward by Putney and colleagues was based on data obtained with rat parotid acinar cells (Putney, 1986b). These studies showed that \(Ca^{2+}\) influx into cells was increased several-fold following stimulation of the cells with an agonist, and that the influx was inactivated when the stimulus was removed or an antagonist was added. These findings gave rise to suggestions that \(Ca^{2+}\) influx was activated either directly as a result of agonist binding to the receptor-

tor (via receptor-operated Ca²⁺ entry, ROC), or by an intracellular second messenger (via a second-messenger-operated entry, SMOC) (see Baum *et al.*, 1993, for an earlier review on this subject). An important study reported by Putney and colleagues demonstrated that when salivary gland cells were treated with the SERCA inhibitor, thapsigargin, there was a slow depletion of internal Ca²⁺ stores and activation of Ca²⁺ influx (Takemura *et al.*, 1989). This study provided convincing evidence that internal Ca²⁺ store depletion *per se* was the signal for activation of Ca²⁺ influx. Since then, SERCA inhibitors have been used in a wide variety of non-excitable cells. Such studies have shown that this type of Ca²⁺ entry mechanism is ubiquitously present in non-excitable cell types, including a number of different salivary gland acinar and ductal cells (Ambudkar *et al.*, 1992, 1993; Putney and Bird, 1993a). This influx, presently referred to as capacitative Ca²⁺ entry (CCE) or store-operated Ca²⁺ entry (SOC), is the primary mode of Ca²⁺ influx in salivary gland cells that have been stimulated by muscarinic and α₁-adrenergic agonists (Ambudkar *et al.*, 1992, 1993). Thus, SOC is central to the regulation of sustained fluid secretion in salivary glands (Putney, 1986a; Melvin *et al.*, 1991; Petersen *et al.*, 1994).

### (6.0) Regulation of Ca²⁺ Influx

Ca²⁺ channels in excitable cells belong to the group of voltage-operated Ca²⁺ channels (VOC) (Catterall, 1995; Clapham, 1995; Berridge, 1997). These have been well-characterized at the physiologic, pharmacologic, and molecular levels. A major advantage in the study of VOC has been the availability of pharmacologic tools, such as dihydropyridines, which specifically interact with the channel protein and inhibit its activity. These agents have been used to label and purify the calcium channel protein, also called the dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR), from the plasma membrane of excitable cells such as neuronal and muscle cells. Further work has established that the VOCs consist of several subunits, although the α subunit contains the pore region and can function as a channel. VOCs have been described in several extensive reviews (Tsien, 1989; Hess, 1990; Catterall, 1995). The characteristics of Ca²⁺ influx in salivary gland cells are distinct from those exhibited by VOCs, and while there is no evidence for the presence of VOCs in salivary acinar cells, it is important to note the marked differences between the SOC and VOC mechanisms. Furthermore, studies with VOCs might provide useful strategies toward the development of methodologies for understanding the mechanism of SOC.

Two critical and as-yet-unanswered questions regarding SOC are: (i) What is the molecular nature of the mechanism which conveys the status of the ER Ca²⁺ store to the plasma membrane to activate and inactivate Ca²⁺ influx? and (ii) What is the molecule(s) that mediates Ca²⁺ influx into non-excitable cells? In the first model proposed by Putney for the regulation of SOC, it was suggested that the internal Ca²⁺ store is physically linked to the plasma membrane such that Ca²⁺ entering the cell directly enters the ER Ca²⁺ store, from where it is released by the IP₃-sensitive channel. This model predicted that the SOC channel protein spans the plasma membrane and the ER. According to this capacitative Ca²⁺ entry model, the resting level of Ca²⁺ in the ER exerts an inhibitory effect on the Ca²⁺ influx pathway (Putney, 1986b). When the Ca²⁺ level decreases, following IP₃-induced Ca²⁺ release, the inhibitory effect is removed and Ca²⁺ influx is activated. The use of Mn²⁺ as a Ca²⁺ surrogate ion helped to clarify the route of entry for Ca²⁺ into the cell (Merritt *et al.*, 1989). Mn²⁺ is a divalent cation which permeates a number of Ca²⁺ channels, including the Ca²⁺ influx pathway in non-excitable cells. An advantage of using Mn²⁺ as a Ca²⁺ surrogate ion is that Mn²⁺ is not a substrate for the Ca²⁺ pumps. Thus, it provides a measure for unidirectional Ca²⁺ influx (Jacob, 1990; Mertz *et al.*, 1990b). Putney and co-workers showed that while Ba²⁺, Sr²⁺, and Mn²⁺ can enter lacrimal acinar cells, only substrates of the SERCA, like Sr²⁺, are taken up into the stores (Kwan and Putney, 1990). Using dispersed parotid gland cells, we were among the first to report that Mn²⁺ influx is regulated by the refill status of the ER Ca²⁺ store, and furthermore, that, during influx, Mn²⁺ is not accumulated in the internal Ca²⁺ store (Mertz *et al.*, 1990b). This study provided us with a new model for Ca²⁺ influx which supported the direct influx of Ca²⁺ into the cytosol. This is the currently accepted route for Ca²⁺ influx in non-excitable cells. Further, Mn²⁺ also provided us with a very useful tool to study the characteristics of Ca²⁺ influx in salivary gland cells.

#### (6.1) STORE-OPERATED CA²⁺ INFLUX IN SALIVARY GLAND CELLS

Over the past ten years, studies in several laboratories, including ours, have been directed toward understanding the mechanisms which mediate and regulate Ca²⁺ influx in rat parotid acinar and other salivary cells. Earlier studies have shown that Ca²⁺ entry into rat parotid acinar cells is prototypical of a store-operated Ca²⁺ influx pathway, since it is activated by depletion of the Ca²⁺ store following stimulation by either α-adrenergic or cholinergic agonists (Ambudkar *et al.*, 1988, 1992, 1993) or by AlF₄⁻ (Mertz *et al.*, 1990a) and inactivated when the stores are refilled (Mertz *et al.*, 1990b). We have reported that the rate of divalent cation influx via SOC in rat parotid acinar cells decreases biphasically with decreasing temperature, suggesting that the Ca²⁺ influx is a regulated event. Interestingly, divalent cation influx into non-stimulated cells exhibits a linear change in activity in response to a decrease in temperature.

ture (Lockwich et al., 1994), suggesting that Ca²⁺ influx into stimulated cells, i.e., after internal Ca²⁺ store depletion, is distinct from that in unstimulated cells. Further, SOC in rat parotid acinar cells is driven by its electrochemical gradient and is modulated by membrane potential (Mertz et al., 1992). Conditions which promote depolarization of the cell inhibit Ca²⁺ influx, while conditions which promote hyperpolarization stimulate Ca²⁺ influx. Similar effects of membrane potential have been shown in sublingual gland cells (Zhang and Melvin, 1993) and in a number of other non-excitable cells (Parekh and Penner, 1997). Extracellular pH also modulates Ca²⁺ influx in rat parotid acinar cells: pH > 7.4 increases Ca²⁺ influx, while pH < 7.4 decreases Ca²⁺ influx (Lockwich et al., 1993b). However, neither pH nor membrane potential directly activates or inactivates Ca²⁺ influx (i.e., in the gating mechanism per se) but only modulates the level of Ca²⁺ entering the cells. An interesting earlier observation was the inhibition of Ca²⁺ influx by carboxyl group-modifying reagents, such as carbodiimides (e.g., dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, DCCD) (Lockwich et al., 1993b). DCCD treatment of the cells also altered the response of Ca²⁺ influx to external pH. This suggested that pH modulated Ca²⁺ influx via effects on the carboxyl group(s) of a protein associated with the store-operated Ca²⁺ influx system.

The kinetic properties of Ca²⁺ influx into rat parotid acinar cells have been studied. It was reported that store-depletion-stimulated Ca²⁺ influx into rat parotid acinar cells is mediated via two pathways: a low-permeability component with a high affinity for external Ca²⁺ (about 150 µM) and a high-permeability component with a relatively low affinity for external Ca²⁺ (about 3 mM) (Chauthaiwale et al., 1996). The Kd of the low-affinity component is similar to that reported for Ca²⁺ influx in T-lymphocytes and for a Ca²⁺ current (I_CRAC) which is stimulated in response to internal Ca²⁺ store depletion in rat mast cells (Donnadieu and Trautmann, 1992; Hoth and Penner, 1993). More recently, we have reported that these pathways are distinct in their sensitivity to divalent cations, DCCD, and pH (Chauthaiwale et al., 1998). Further, the low-affinity Ca²⁺ influx component is also modulated by Ca²⁺ and protein phosphorylation (Chauthaiwale et al., 1996). Analysis of these data suggests that the two Ca²⁺ influx components represent flux via distinct proteins. According to our estimations, the high-affinity component mediates about 40% of the Ca²⁺ flux under normal physiologic conditions. It is tempting to speculate that these two Ca²⁺ influx components have definite physiologic roles in the salivary gland acinar cell. It can be suggested that the high-affinity low-capacity Ca²⁺ influx has a role in maintaining the low "basal"

**Figure 2. Proposed model for the regulation of Ca²⁺ influx in rat parotid gland cells. The Fig. depicts our current model that SOC in rat parotid acinar cells is determined by Ca²⁺ influx via two components with low and high affinities for Ca²⁺. The Ca²⁺ permeability of the cells is modulated by Ca²⁺ and via a phosphorylation-dephosphorylation mechanism. The model in (A) suggests that there is only one site of Ca²⁺ influx and that the activity of this site is either increased or decreased, depending on the level of stimulation, via the phosphorylation mechanism. The model shown in (B) suggests that there are two distinct Ca²⁺ influx components, of which the low-affinity (high-permeability) component is subject to modulation by phosphorylation or Ca²⁺.**

level of fluid secretion, which is likely induced by a low level of stimulation of the gland and requires a constant low level of Ca²⁺ influx. This can be effectively provided by the high-affinity component which functions at V_max in the presence of physiologic levels of external [Ca²⁺]. Further, with such low Ca²⁺ influx levels, the cell will not have to expend too much energy pumping out Ca²⁺ to maintain low [Ca²⁺]_i. When cells are stimulated further, Ca²⁺ influx via the low-affinity/high-permeability component is increased, which then increases the rate of fluid secretion. Based on our studies (Sakai and Ambudkar, 1996, 1997; also see below), we suggest that this is achieved by decreasing the phosphorylation level of either the influx protein per se or an associated protein that regulates its activity.

While the studies described above have provided us with some basic understanding of how the SOC is activated and which factors modulate the activity in salivary gland cells, the identity of the signal eliciting the store-dependent activation of the Ca²⁺ influx pathway remains elusive. This is a fundamental problem that needs to be resolved in salivary glands and all other types of non-excitable cells.

(6.2) MODELS FOR THE ACTIVATION OF THE STORE-OPERATED CA²⁺ INFLUX

Several factors have been proposed as possible regulators of SOC in non-excitable cells (for an extensive review on store-depletion-activated Ca²⁺ influx, see Parekh and

atic acinar cells and lacrimal cells), on the effects of agents such as GTPγS, cGMP, and tyrosine kinase on Ca²⁺ influx (Parekh and Penner, 1997). However, the effects of these agents on Ca²⁺ influx in salivary gland cells have not yet been studied in any detail.

It has been reported that a protein kinase is likely involved in determining the level of Ca²⁺ influx into rat parotid acinar cells (Tojyo et al., 1995; Sakai and Ambudkar, 1996, 1997). Treatment of the cells with the protein serine/threonine phosphatase inhibitors, calyculin A or okadaic acid, inhibits Ca²⁺ influx, while treatment with the protein kinase inhibitors, staurosporine or K252a, increases Ca²⁺ influx and prevents the inhibition induced by the phosphatase inhibitors. Ca²⁺ also induces an inhibitory effect on the SOC in rat parotid acinar cells (Foskett and Wong, 1994; Hiramatsu et al., 1992). Analysis of the data indicates that the Ca²⁺-induced inhibition of SOC is mediated via the putative staurosporine-sensitive protein kinase (Sakai and Ambudkar, 1997). Importantly, this inhibition is not involved in the inactivation of Ca²⁺ influx which occurs as a result of the refilling of internal Ca²⁺ stores. In aggregate, analysis of these data suggests that phosphorylation is a modulator of SOC in rat parotid acinar cells and not the store-depletion-induced regulator. We have proposed that rat parotid acinar cells can function in a low-permeability state (phosphorylated form) and a high-permeability state (dephosphorylated form; see Fig. 2). Similar results were obtained in the salivary gland cell line, HSG, where we have examined both [Ca²⁺]i changes as well as the store-depletion-activated Ca²⁺ influx current (Liu et al., 1998b). Thus, we suggest that the phosphorylation-dependent modulation of SOC is likely to be important in determining the level of Ca²⁺ influx in stimulated and resting salivary glands.

Two main models have been proposed to explain the gating of the SOC, although at present there are no data to support or rule out either model conclusively (Fig. 3).

Penner, 1997). Recently, n-nitric oxide synthase has been suggested to mediate the regulation of SOC in rat submandibular gland acinar and ductal cells (Xu et al., 1997). Several studies have been carried out with other non-excitable cells, including exocrine gland cells (e.g., pancre-
It should be noted that these models do not address \(\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\) influx in any specific cell type but attempt to explain the activation of SOC in non-excitable cells in general. Thus, either mechanism might be applicable for the regulation of SOC in salivary gland cells.

### (6.2.1) Conformational coupling hypothesis

This hypothesis was first proposed on the basis of the excitation-contraction coupling mechanism in skeletal muscle cells, whereby the depolarization signal, sensed by the dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR) in the plasma membrane, is transmitted to the ryanodine receptor (RyR) in the sarcoplasmic reticulum, the site of \(\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\) release. It is generally accepted that these proteins interact directly via the foot structures that have been identified on the RyR which appear to span the region between the ER and the T-tubule membrane and thus may provide a likely site for protein-protein interaction. The major rationale for this hypothesis is the homology between the \(I P_{3} R\) and RyR (Mikoshiba, 1993). These two receptors appear to have evolved from the same common ancestor, since they share many structural and physiologic similarities. They display a similar biphasic sensitivity to \(\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\) and can be activated by second messengers—\(I P_{3}\) in the case of \(I P_{3} R\) and c-ADP ribose in the case of RyR. Furthermore, there is considerable homology in their C-terminal and N-terminal domains. In both proteins, the N-terminal domain projects into the cytoplasm. It has been proposed that this domain is the region which interacts with the \(\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\) influx channel in the plasma membrane (Meissner, 1994; Berridge, 1996, 1997). An earlier version of the conformational coupling hypothesis proposed by Irvine (1990) suggested that the \(I P_{3} R\) interacted with a putative receptor for \(I P_{4}\) in the plasma membrane. This model predicted that the latter was the site of \(\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\) influx. According to this hypothesis, the depletion of \(\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\) in the ER lumen is detected by the \(I P_{3} R\), which undergoes a conformational change that is transmitted to and activates the \(I P_{4} R\). This hypothesis is based on reports that the \(I P_{3} R\) is sensitive to luminal \([\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]\) and on studies that \(I P_{4}\) can activate influx in some systems (Irvine, 1990). However, the effect of luminal \(\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\) on the \(I P_{3} R\) has not been unequivocal, and furthermore, the effects of \(I P_{4}\) have not been consistently observed in various cell types.

More recently, Berridge has suggested that the coupling between the ER and plasma membrane is achieved via an \(I P_{3}\) receptor in the ER and an as-yet-unidentified \(\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\) channel protein in the plasma membrane (Berridge, 1996, 1997). The model is depicted in Fig. 3A. This suggestion is primarily based on the report that expression of the antisense oligonucleotide of \(I P_{3} R 1\) abolished \(I P_{3}\)-mediated \(\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\) release in T-lymphocytes but not thapsigargin-stimulated \(\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\) entry (Jayaraman et

al., 1995). Since the expression of \(I P_{3} R 1\), and probably \(I P_{3} R 2\), was suppressed in these cells, it was suggested that \(\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\) entry was mediated via an interaction with the \(I P_{3} R 3\) receptor, or another \(I P_{3} R\) subtype that was not involved in \(\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\) release. Consistent with this hypothesis, overexpression of \(I P_{3} R 3\) in T-lymphocytes and Xenopus oocytes was found to increase \(\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\) influx substantially (these studies have been previously reviewed by Berridge, 1997, and Parekh and Penner, 1997). However, inconsistent with this model is the report (Khan et al., 1996) that the \(I P_{3} R 3\) is inserted into the plasma membrane itself. This suggested that it might function directly as a channel gated by intracellular \(I P_{3}\) and not as a store-operated pathway or a sensor of the \([\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]\) in the lumen of the ER. Additionally, the \(I P_{3} R 3\) does not appear to be expressed in Xenopus oocytes, although these cells display SOC.

#### (6.2.2) Diffusible activator hypothesis

The second major model that has been proposed (see Fig. 3b) involves the release of a diffusible metabolite from the ER as \(\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\) is released. Consistent with this hypothesis, a small-molecular-weight (< 500 kDa) metabolite, the calcium influx factor (CIF), was isolated from activated Jurkat T-lymphocytes which stimulated \(\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\) influx in oocytes and a number of non-excitable cells (Randriamampita and Tsien, 1993). It was further reported that CIF activity was increased by okadaic acid, suggesting that the factor is phosphorylated (Randriamampita and Tsien, 1995). The involvement of a diffusible messenger in SOC was also suggested by Parekh et al. (1993), based on studies with oocytes that showed that \(\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\) influx-dependent \(\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\)currents ran down rapidly when patches were excised after the current was stimulated in the whole-cell mode. It is also possible that CIF is a cytosolic factor and that another factor (marked "A" in Fig. 3) is released from the ER during internal \(\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\) release, which in turn activates CIF. Whether CIF also diffuses from the cell to induce effects on neighboring cells is not yet known.

It is important to note that data that conclusively support either model are presently lacking. In fact, the presently available data are in conflict. For example, evidence against the involvement of CIF has been reported by Putney and co-workers (Gilon et al., 1995), who showed that CIF extracted from Jurkat cells evoked \(\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\) influx in astrocytoma cells by a mechanism independent of internal \(\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\) store depletion. Further, in mouse lacrimal cells and rat hepatocytes, CIF induced both internal \(\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\) release and \(\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\) influx, and the latter was blocked by the muscarinic receptor antagonist, atropine (Gilon et al., 1995). Another recent study (Jaconi et al., 1997) is also not consistent with the diffusible-messenger hypothesis for the activation of SOC. This study suggests that the physical proximity of the ER and plasma membrane is critical to

Whether this activation is mediated by direct physical interactions remains to be demonstrated. However, it was also recently demonstrated that Ca²⁺ influx is not affected by reagents which drastically affect cytoskeletal arrangement and distort the morphology of the cell (Ribiero et al., 1997). These latter data are inconsistent with the involvement of a physical interaction between the ER and the plasma membrane in the activation of SOC. Another model which has received some consideration involves vesicle fusion as a mechanism whereby Ca²⁺ influx channels are inserted into the plasma membrane upon internal Ca²⁺ store depletion (Holda et al., 1998). However, Hoth and Penner (1992) had previously reported that there was no change in the capacitance during activation of Ca²⁺ influx, a finding inconsistent with vesicle fusion. Clearly, further studies are required to resolve the exact mechanism involved in the activation of the store-operated Ca²⁺ influx.

Another important question that remains unanswered is the mechanism of inactivation of the SOC which occurs in response to refilling of the internal Ca²⁺ store(s). It is not presently clear whether the activation and inactivation are mediated via the same mechanism. For example, if a phosphatase is activated by internal Ca²⁺ store depletion, is a kinase activated upon refill? Or if generation of CIF stimulates SOC, does its degradation or inhibition of its synthesis inactivate SOC? Careful studies are required to answer these questions. It should also be noted that SOC in all types of cells might not be regulated by the same mechanism. It can also be speculated that if the SOC protein occurs in various isoforms, as has been the case with a number of other Ca²⁺ channels, it is possible that the regulation of these proteins might vary. Thus, the phenotype of the SOC in different cells will depend on the isoform that is expressed.

(6.3) TOWARD IDENTIFICATION OF THE CA²⁺ INFLUX PROTEIN(S)

As discussed above, a major impedance to our understanding of the mechanism of Ca²⁺ influx in non-excitable cells is the lack of information regarding the molecule(s) that mediates Ca²⁺ influx across the plasma membrane. The lack of progress in this area is primarily due to the lack of specific pharmacologic tools which specifically inhibit or activate SOC and that can be used to label the putative influx protein(s). A major breakthrough was the development of methods to measure the Ca²⁺ current activated in response to internal Ca²⁺ store depletion (Hoth and Penner, 1992). These methods strongly suggested that the influx was mediated via a channel-like molecule. These first studies were carried out with mast cells, and the Ca²⁺-selective current that was activated was named ICRAC. ICRAC has several distinct characteristics, including its ion selectivity, inhibition by divalent cations, and regulation by

Ca²⁺ (Hoth and Penner, 1993; Fasolato et al., 1993; Parekh and Penner, 1997). ICRAC has also been extensively studied in T-lymphocytes (Zweifach and Lewis, 1993, 1995, 1996). Subsequently, similar studies have been reported by several other investigators using a number of cell types (Clapham, 1995; Parekh and Penner, 1997). The characteristics of the inward currents measured in response to internal Ca²⁺ store depletion in a number of different cell types suggest the presence of Ca²⁺ influx channel(s) which vary with respect to their (i) relative permeabilities to monovalent and divalent cations and (ii) sensitivity to inhibition by divalent and trivalent ions. These currents have been referred to as ICCe, ICRAc, or ISOC. We have recently characterized a SOC-associated inward Ca²⁺ current in HSG cells (Liu et al., 1998b). This current appears to be regulated via a feedback inhibitory mechanism by the Ca²⁺ entering the cell, which is likely mediated by a staurosporine-sensitive protein kinase. Furthermore, the current is sensitive to phosphatase inhibitors, a finding consistent with our previous studies with rat parotid acinar cells. In aggregate, these studies confirm our suggestion that changes in protein phosphorylation can alter the permeability of salivary cells to Ca²⁺. However, the protein(s), which could be the Ca²⁺ influx channel per se or an associated regulatory protein, has not yet been identified.

Recent studies have also suggested that the putative Ca²⁺ entry channel and the SERCA pump are functionally associated. It was shown that the Ca²⁺ entering the cell via the SOC channel is rapidly taken up into internal Ca²⁺ stores, from where it is released at localized sites in the cell (Liu et al., 1998a). Importantly, the high activity of the SERCA keeps the [Ca²⁺]i in the region of Ca²⁺ influx low, so as to prevent the feedback inactivation of the influx mechanism: When the SERCA is inhibited, the SOC current is rapidly inactivated. Thus, the ER can be predicted to be close to the plasma membrane. This suggestion is consistent with earlier reports (Putney, 1986b; Foskett et al., 1989) on salivary gland cells and with more recent data reported by Petersen and co-workers (Mogami et al., 1997, 1998), working with pancreatic acinar cells. An interesting concept that arises from these data is that there may be microdomains within the cell which are determined by the localization of functionally associated proteins. Such a microdomain can be expected to fulfill a specific physiologic function, e.g., the Ca²⁺-dependent activation of the K⁺ channel or the Ca²⁺ store-regulation of the SOC channel. It has been suggested that the cytosolic Ca²⁺ buffering might also be compartmentalized. Thus, the diffusional rate of Ca²⁺ might vary in different regions of the cell (e.g., in the cytosol or in the ER lumen), or even within the same region (e.g., different areas of the cytosol or different regions of the ER lumen). Furthermore, a group of proteins involved in a particular signaling mechanism can form complexes, so that pro-tein-protein interactions might be mediated by direct interactions of specific domains in the proteins or facilitated via scaffolding or cytoskeletal proteins (Xu et al., 1996; Montell, 1997). Although the IP₃R has been shown to interact with the cytoskeleton via the ankyrin binding regions (Mikoshiba, 1993), there are presently no data to show that the Ca²⁺ influx channel is associated with any cytoskeletal protein(s) or other proteins of the Ca²⁺ signaling mechanism. Demonstration of such an interaction will be very important and interesting. However, it will require, at minimum, the identification of the Ca²⁺ influx channel protein.

(6.4) THE TRP GENE PRODUCT AS A CANDIDATE PROTEIN FOR CA²⁺ INFLUX

The transient receptor potential (trp) gene was first proposed as an SOC channel candidate based on studies with photoreceptor signaling in the Drosophila trp mutants (for reviews, see Hardie and Minke, 1993; Minke and Selinger, 1996; Zuker, 1996; Montell, 1997). Electroretinograms of the compound eyes from these mutants showed the typical fast-depolarizing response due to a Na⁺ current. However, the response was transient, and the sustained phase of the response, due to a current carrying both Na⁺ and Ca²⁺, was not seen. This type of response was also obtained when normal eyes were placed under Ca²⁺-free conditions. Molecular cloning of the trp gene and analysis of the deduced amino acid structure suggested that the gene encoded a protein with 8 putative transmembrane domains, with some homology to VOCs. This suggested that trp might encode a Ca²⁺ channel. Another trp-like gene (trpl) was also cloned from the Drosophila head and was found to be a calmodulin-binding protein, with considerable homology to trp, except in the C-terminal region. Both trp and trpl showed some homology to voltage-dependent Ca²⁺ and Na⁺ channels, especially in the S5-S6 linker region, which is believed to be the pore region of the VOC. However, both genes lacked the so-called voltage sensor region present in VOC, suggesting that trp and trpl did not belong to the VOC family of Ca²⁺ channels. Expression of the gene products revealed that trp and trpl products together constitute the overall light response in Drosophila photoreceptor cells (Niemeyer et al., 1996). It was reported that the trp gene product induced increases in thapsigargin-induced Ca²⁺-selective currents, while the trpl activity was not store-dependent and induced relatively non-selective cation conductance (Vaca et al., 1994; Dong et al., 1995). Further, expression of a chimera in which the C-terminal region of trp was replaced with that of trpl resulted in a loss of the store-depletion-dependent Ca²⁺ current; instead, the activity was more like that of trpl. Thus, it was suggested that the trp gene might encode the putative SOC channel protein (Sinkins et al., 1996).

The promising results obtained with Drosophila trp led to a search for mammalian homologs for the trp gene, despite the fact that the activity of the trp gene product was distinct from that of SOC and I_CRAC reported in a number of cells. The first mammalian trp gene to be cloned was human trp1 (Wes et al., 1995; Zhu et al., 1996a; Zitt et al., 1996). Both a long form and a short form (α and β) of this gene have been identified. This gene shows considerable homology to the Drosophila trp gene, except it has a much shorter C-terminal region. Further studies have led to the identification of 6 human trp (htrp1-6), 6 mouse trp (mtrp1-6), and 3 bovine trp genes (Philipp et al., 1996; Zhu et al., 1996b; Birnbaumer et al., 1996). The presence of trp genes has been demonstrated in several tissues from rats, mice, and humans by means of the polymerase chain-reaction (PCR) or Northern blot procedures. trp1 appears to have a wider distribution than trp3 or trp6, which are predominantly expressed in the heart and brain. Several trp genes have now been expressed in cell lines such as COS, CHO, and HEK. However, consistent and convincing evidence of increases in SOC have not been reported, except in the short (β) form of htrp1, which induced non-selective cation currents in response to IP₃ and thapsigargin (Zitt et al., 1996), and bovine trp4, which also demonstrated appreciable increases in SOC (Philipp et al., 1996). The most convincing evidence for a role for the trp gene in SOC comes from studies done by Zhu et al. (1996b), who showed that expression of trp sequences in the antisense direction abolished SOC in murine Ltk- cells. Expression of sequences of all 6 mtrp genes or of mtrp4 alone in the antisense direction was enough to suppress SOC (Zhu et al., 1996b; Birnbaumer et al., 1996). However, the data that are presently available are not sufficient to demonstrate conclusively that one or more of the trp gene products form the SOC channel. A main problem is that the electrophysiologic characteristics of the expressed gene products are distinct from those of the endogenous SOC in the cells used to express them (Birnbaumer et al., 1996; Parekh and Penner, 1997). While the data discussed above with mtrp4 and btrp4 appear to be promising, further studies will be required to clarify the function of the Trp proteins. It is possible that some of the Trp proteins serve a function completely unrelated to SOC in cells. Several as-yet-unidentified intracellular Ca²⁺ channels might be present in various organelles. Stretch-activated cation channels have been reported in various salivary cell types (Cook et al., 1994), and Ca²⁺ influx has also been associated with the activation of certain growth factor receptors, such as the insulin-like growth factor receptors, during the cell cycle (Means, 1994). It is possible that the trp gene(s) could encode any of these cation channels. Nevertheless, it is impressive that these recent studies have led to the identification of a new gene family that appears to encode a class of novel Ca²⁺-selective, or non-selective Ca²⁺-permeable, cation

channels. Further work on the tissue distribution/expression of these proteins, subcellular localization, and regulation of their activity in various cell types will provide a more comprehensive understanding of their physiologic function.

In recent studies, we have demonstrated that Trpl is present in rat parotid and submandibular glands and in HSG cells (Wang et al., 1999). Further, we have cloned a full-length trplβ isoform from rat brain, and have observed that both α and β isoforms exist in rat brain and submandibular glands. trplβ was found to be expressed in a number of rat tissues, including liver.

### (6.5) STRATEGIES FOR PURIFYING THE SOC CHANNEL PROTEIN(S)

Ca²⁺ channels have been purified from plasma membranes of neuronal and muscle tissues (VOC) (Florio et al., 1992; Catterall, 1995), sarcoplasmic reticulum of skeletal and cardiac muscle (RyR) (Shoshan-Barmatz and Zarka, 1992; Meissner, 1994), and endoplasmic reticulum of non-excitable cells (IP₃R) (Ferris et al., 1989). The general purification scheme involves separating the membrane fraction where the protein is localized, solubilization by means of non-denaturing relatively mild detergents, reconstitution of the protein into an artificial membrane system, and measurement of activity (Ca²⁺ uptake in liposomes and/or Ca²⁺ currents in black lipid membranes). The success of the technique depends on (i) retention of the function of the protein and (ii) establishment of an assay system which can be used to identify the protein (Maloney and Ambudkar, 1989). About six years ago, we initiated studies to isolate the proteins that might form the SOC channel in rat parotid acinar cells (Lockwich et al., 1993a). Given the lack of pharmacologic tools to identify SOC activity, we used the characteristics of Ca²⁺ entry in intact parotid gland cells to define a passive Ca²⁺ permeability in isolated basolateral plasma membrane vesicles (BLMV; Lockwich et al., 1993a,b, 1994). To our knowledge, these studies represent the first and only effort to purify protein(s) that might be involved in Ca²⁺ entry into non-excitable cells.

We have reported the presence of a DCCD- and temperature-sensitive passive Ca²⁺ influx component in BLMV (Lockwich et al., 1993b, 1994). Further, kinetic studies on the Ca²⁺ influx into BLMV identified two components with relatively low and high affinities for Ca²⁺—150 μM and 2.4 mM, respectively—which are similar to those detected in the intact cells (Lockwich et al., 1994; Chauthaiwale et al., 1996, 1998). The high-affinity component is sensitive to DCCD, pH, and temperature. Further, by using trypsin, we confirmed that Ca²⁺ influx into BLMV was mediated by a temperature-sensitive protein (Lockwich et al., 1994). More recently, we have reported that the two Ca²⁺ influx components in BLMV, as in intact cells, display distinct characteristics, including sensitivities to Zn²⁺, Ni²⁺, DCCD, and pH,

suggesting that the two Ca²⁺ influx components might be mediated by different proteins (Chauthaiwale et al., 1998).

For purification of these putative Ca²⁺ channel proteins, a solubilization-reconstitution protocol was used which seems to be especially useful for the functional reconstitution of multicomponent proteins (Maloney and Ambudkar, 1989). The BLMV proteins were solubilized with detergent, in the presence of lipids and glycerol, and then reconstituted into relatively ion-impermeant lipid vesicles (liposomes). ⁴⁵Ca²⁺ uptake into the liposomes containing the reconstituted proteins demonstrated the incorporation of a passive Ca²⁺ transport component with a high affinity for Ca²⁺ (150 μM) similar to that seen in BLMV, which was inhibited by DCCD and Zn²⁺ (Lockwich et al., 1995). Thus, we accomplished the solubilization and reconstitution of a Ca²⁺ influx component from BLMV into proteoliposomes in a functional form. These studies also provided us with an efficient assay system for studying the function of the isolated putative Ca²⁺ channel proteins.

### (7.0) Spatio-Temporal Aspects of Ca²⁺ Signaling

The improved capabilities for the imaging of intracellular [Ca²⁺]ᵢ changes have provided evidence for the spatio-temporal regulation of intracellular Ca²⁺ signals (Petersen et al., 1994; Berridge, 1997). The types of signals that have been recorded are oscillatory [Ca²⁺]ᵢ increases and wave-propagation of [Ca²⁺]ᵢ increases. Several recent reviews address the possible mechanisms which might account for the localization, magnitude, and frequency of such changes in [Ca²⁺]ᵢ, and several models have been proposed. The details of these issues will not be discussed in this review (the reader is directed to Berridge and Irvine, 1989; Petersen, 1992; Berridge, 1993, 1997; Fewtrell, 1993; Marshall and Taylor, 1993; and Petersen et al., 1994). In general, these recent models suggest that [Ca²⁺]ᵢ oscillations are generated as a result of the regulation of either intracellular Ca²⁺ release or Ca²⁺ influx. Two possible mechanisms have been proposed to explain oscillations which are induced by the regulation of internal Ca²⁺ release. The first mechanism suggests that IP₃R is the only intracellular Ca²⁺ release site and that there is only this type of internal Ca²⁺ store. In this model, oscillatory changes are explained solely on the basis of the biphasic effect of Ca²⁺ on the activity of the IP₃R. The second mechanism suggests the involvement of a second Ca²⁺ store, containing either an IP₃R with a different sensitivity to IP₃ or a RyR. The latter suggests that a Ca²⁺-induced Ca²⁺ release (CICR) mechanism is involved in the oscillations and that CICR is triggered by an initial increase in [Ca²⁺]ᵢ due to release of Ca²⁺ from an IP₃-sensitive Ca²⁺ store. RyR have not been found in all cell types, although recently, RyR have been reported in salivary

gland cells (Lee et al., 1997a,b). Further studies are required if we are to understand their role in the physiology of the gland. In some cells, \([Ca^{2+}]_{i}\) oscillations are dependent on the presence of external \(Ca^{2+}\). Thus, it has been proposed that they are generated by the repeated inactivation and activation of \(Ca^{2+}\) influx. In these models, \(Ca^{2+}\) influx is inhibited either directly by elevations in \([Ca^{2+}]_{i}\) (Foskett and Wong, 1994) or indirectly via refilling of internal \(Ca^{2+}\) stores (Liu et al., 1998a).

Cells like pancreatic acinar cells also display agonist-specific signals which are localized in certain regions of the cell, i.e., the increase in \([Ca^{2+}]_{i}\) achieved by cholecystokinin is distinct from that induced by acetylcholine (Petersen, 1992; Petersen et al., 1994). Localized small increases in \([Ca^{2+}]_{i}\) (\(Ca^{2+}\) spikes) have been seen with low concentrations of \(IP_{3}\) or acetylcholine. These do not appear to depend on external \(Ca^{2+}\) or induce \(Ca^{2+}\) influx. It has been suggested that this \([Ca^{2+}]_{i}\) increase may involve either a different type of \(Ca^{2+}\) store, i.e., one not associated with SOC, or a store which is localized in the cell such that \(Ca^{2+}\) release cannot activate the SOC in the plasma membrane. On the other hand, cholecystokinin gives rise to relatively more global oscillations. At higher agonist levels, \(Ca^{2+}\) spikes can also spread as a regenerative wave toward other cellular areas. The nature of the elementary events that initiate and propagate these regenerative \(Ca^{2+}\) waves has been a subject which has received much interest (Clapham, 1995; Berridge, 1997). Understanding the physiologic basis for these localized and transient changes in \([Ca^{2+}]_{i}\) presents a challenging problem.

Both oscillatory as well as wave-like propagation of \([Ca^{2+}]_{i}\) has been reported in salivary gland cells. The first report of oscillations in salivary gland cells was made in rat parotid acinar cells (Gray, 1988). This study described rapid baseline oscillations in rat parotid acini stimulated with \(Ca^{2+}\) mobilizing agonists. Subsequently, Foskett and co-workers demonstrated slower oscillations in \([Ca^{2+}]_{i}\) which were dependent on \(Ca^{2+}\) influx, likely via a \([Ca^{2+}]_{i}\)-dependent feedback inhibition (Foskett and Wong, 1994). These results suggested that the \(IP_{3}\) receptor was not involved in the mechanism of the oscillation. Contrary to these findings, we have observed that oscillations in HSG cells are dependent on \(Ca^{2+}\) influx but also require the activity of SERCA, and thus are dependent

---

**Figure 4.** Localized uptake and release of \(Ca^{2+}\) in salivary gland acinar cells. This illustration depicts our current understanding of the route of \(Ca^{2+}\) influx and release in salivary acinar cells. According to our studies (see text for discussion), \(Ca^{2+}\) entering the cell is rapidly accumulated into the ER \(Ca^{2+}\) store, with minimal diffusion in the region of influx. \(Ca^{2+}\) is then routed within the ER to localized sites, where it is released via the \(IP_{3}\)-sensitive \(Ca^{2+}\) release channel, or other release sites presently unknown. These release sites are likely determined by the localization of the ion transport mechanisms, which are regulated via \(Ca^{2+}\) release.

on the \(Ca^{2+}\) store. We have proposed that oscillations in HSG cells are due to regulation of the \(IP_{3}\) receptor and that the subsequent effects on \(Ca^{2+}\) influx are due to repetitive emptying or refilling of internal \(Ca^{2+}\) stores (Liu et al., 1988a).

Wavelike propagation of \([Ca^{2+}]_{i}\) changes has also been reported in parotid and submandibular gland cells (Lee et al., 1997a,b; Tojyo et al., 1997). These studies show that initiation of the wave occurs at the luminal end of the cell and that the wave then propagates to the basolateral region. The rate of the propagation depends on the activity of the SERCA pumps as well as \(IP_{3}\) receptors. Thus, it appears that the magnitude and pattern of changes in \([Ca^{2+}]_{i}\) are dependent on the localization and activity of the various \(Ca^{2+}\) flux pathways described above. It is likely that both the number of transport proteins and the regulation of their activity are important factors in the determination of localized or global changes in \([Ca^{2+}]_{i}\). Also important are the cellular distribution and concentration of various \(Ca^{2+}\) binding and buffering proteins.

Recent studies suggest that a microdomain exists in the region of the cell where \(Ca^{2+}\) influx occurs (Mogami et

al., 1997, 1998; Liu et al., 1998a,b). For example, we have shown that Ca²⁺ influx alone cannot support the activation of the Ca²⁺-activated K⁺ channel in HSG cells, unless the IP₃-induced Ca²⁺ release is activated. Thus, we have proposed that the Ca²⁺ that comes into the cell is rapidly taken up into the internal Ca²⁺ store by the activity of SERCA. Ca²⁺ is then routed via the ER to sites where it is released into the cytosol through the IP₃ receptor. We suggest that the Ca²⁺ release sites are likely to be localized in regions where Ca²⁺-dependent regulation of cell function can be effectively achieved. Our data are consistent with the model proposed by Petersen and co-workers, which suggests that Ca²⁺ is taken up into the ER store at the basolateral end of the cell and delivered via ER “tunnels” to Ca²⁺ release sites away from the region of Ca²⁺ influx (Mogami et al., 1997, 1998). One important outcome of these studies is the suggestion that the SOC is functionally associated with the SERCA and that these two Ca²⁺ transporters must be localized close to the subplasma membrane region of the cell. As discussed above, it has been suggested that there is a physical interaction between an IP₃R and the SOC channel protein which regulates the activation and inactivation of SOC (Berridge, 1995, 1997). Thus, the localization of SERCA is also likely to be important in the regulation of SOC (see Fig. 4). How the cell controls the distribution and architecture of these protein complexes remains to be clarified. In this context, it is interesting to note the recent suggestions about the possible role of scaffolding proteins in the maintenance and regulation of signaling complexes which might regulate SOC (Montell, 1997).

### (8.0) Conclusion

This review has attempted to cover various aspects of Ca²⁺ signaling pertaining to the mechanism of fluid secretion in salivary glands. Clearly, the last 20 years have witnessed much progress in our understanding of the mechanisms involved in ion transport mechanisms and signal transduction events. This has been propelled by the development of very efficient experimental tools, such as patch-clamp techniques, indicators for detection of ions, and methods for identifying various genes and the function of the gene products. However, several critical questions remain unanswered. Some of these questions are related specifically to salivary gland function, and some involve the field of Ca²⁺ signaling in general. An important aspect of Ca²⁺ signaling which has received little attention in salivary glands is the possible role of the various Ca²⁺ mobilizing receptor systems present in salivary gland cells, i.e., whether they act independently or in concert to regulate fluid secretion. It will also be important to: (i) determine the localization of signal transduction proteins (such as receptors, G-proteins, and PLC), Ca²⁺ channels, Ca²⁺ pumps, Ca²⁺ stores, and

the Ca²⁺-dependent ion channels in salivary gland cells; and (ii) demonstrate that the localization is physiologically relevant. Finally, a fundamental question that remains to be addressed is regarding the molecular mechanism(s) which mediates and regulates SOC. A multifaceted approach that combines molecular biology with physiology and biochemistry should provide rapid advances in this area within the next few years.
