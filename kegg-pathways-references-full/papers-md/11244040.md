■ Abstract The bare lymphocyte syndrome (BLS) is a hereditary immunodeficiency resulting from the absence of major histocompatibility complex class II (MHCII) expression. Considering the central role of MHCII molecules in the development and activation of CD4⁺ T cells, it is not surprising that the immune system of the patients is severely impaired. BLS is the prototype of a “disease of gene regulation.” The affected genes encode RFXANK, RFX5, RFXAP, and CIITA, four regulatory factors that are highly specific and essential for MHCII genes. The first three are subunits of RFX, a trimeric complex that binds to all MHCII promoters. CIITA is a non-DNA-binding coactivator that functions as the master control factor for MHCII expression. The study of RFX and CIITA has made major contributions to our comprehension of the molecular mechanisms controlling MHCII genes and has made this system into a textbook model for the regulation of gene expression.

PREAMBLE: BLS as a Unique Model System

Major histocompatibility complex class II (MHCII) deficiency (official WHO nomenclature) is frequently also referred to as the bare lymphocyte syndrome (BLS). It is a rare form of inherited immunodeficiency having an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance. The disease is characterized by the lack of expression of MHCII molecules, which leads to severe immunodeficiency, recurrent infections, and frequently to death in early childhood (1–5). BLS exhibits several remarkable and unique features that have fascinated geneticists, immunologists, and specialists in the regulation of gene expression.

From the point of view of medical genetics, BLS is of special interest for at least three reasons. First, the genes implicated in the phenotypic manifestation of the disease, namely the family of MHCII genes on chromosome 6, are in fact intact. The genes that are mutated in BLS are distinct from the MHCII genes themselves and are located on different chromosomes (Figure 1). Mutations in

Figure 1 The bare lymphocyte syndrome (BLS) is a disease of MHCII gene regulation. BLS is characterized by a dissociation between the genes that are mutated in the disease (top: RFX5, RFXAP, CIITA and RFXANK on chromosomes 1, 13, 16 and 19, respectively) and the genes whose lack of expression accounts for the observed phenotype (bottom, MHCII genes on chromosome 6).  

any one of these non-MHC genes are responsible for the lack of MHCII expression. This dissociation between the genes that are defective in the disease and those that are implicated in the observed phenotype is highly unusual (Figure 1). Second, although BLS is a monogenic disease in which a single defective gene is responsible for the entire clinical picture, and although the disease is clinically homogeneous, it can result from mutations in any one of four distinct genes (Figure 1). Curiously, a genetic defect in each of these four genes leads to the same clinical syndrome. This genetic heterogeneity associated with clinical homogeneity is also unusual. Thirdly, BLS represents the prototype of a “disease of gene regulation.” The affected genes encode four trans-acting regulatory factors that are essential and highly specific for the control of MHCII gene expression (Figure 1).
It is evident that the last point explains the aforementioned distinction between the genetic defects and their phenotypic manifestations.

From the point of view of the control of the immune response, as well as of the regulation of gene expression in general, elucidation of BLS at the molecular level has led to numerous seminal findings. First, it is fair to say that the discovery of the four regulatory genes implicated in BLS has represented a major contribution to what we know today about the molecular basis of the regulation of MHCII gene expression. Given the tight and complex nature of this regulation, and its central role in the control of the immune response, the contribution of BLS to immunology has been remarkable. Second, identification of the four regulatory genes affected in BLS has provided us with a unique example of four transcription factors that are both essential and specific for the control of MHCII expression. This also represents a rather unusual situation because most transcription factors exhibit functional redundancy with other factors and/or exert pleiotropic effects via their control over numerous unrelated target genes. Finally, dissection of the mechanisms by which the four regulatory factors affected in BLS exert their control over MHCII genes has provided us with a textbook model for the regulation of gene expression. In particular, it has emphasized the essential role of protein-protein interactions in transcriptional control and the importance of cooperativity as a means for generating specificity.

The first part of this review covers BLS as a disease, discusses its molecular basis, and summarizes the discovery, between 1993 and 1998, of the four affected regulatory genes and the transacting factors that they encode. The second part deals with the contribution that the discovery of these four transactivators has made to our current understanding of the mechanisms regulating the expression of MHCII genes.

## INTRODUCTION: Function and Regulation of MHCII Expression

MHCII molecules are heterodimeric ($\alpha/\beta$) transmembrane glycoproteins. In humans there are three MHCII isotypes—HLA-DR, HLA-DQ, and HLA-DP—each of which is composed of a distinct pair of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ chains. The genes encoding the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ chains of HLA-DR, HLA-DQ, and HLA-DP are clustered in the D region of the MHC on the short arm of chromosome 6 (6). MHCII molecules are specialized for the presentation of peptides to the antigen receptor (TCR) of CD4${}^{+}$ T helper cells. Engagement of MHCII–peptide complexes by the TCR of CD4${}^{+}$ T cells is a key event in the development, activation, and regulation of the adaptive immune system. First, the recognition of MHCII–peptide complexes on epithelial cells and bone marrow-derived cells in the thymus is central to the positive and negative selection processes that sculpt the TCR repertoire of the CD4${}^{+}$ T cell population (7). Second, the priming, propagation, and regulation of antigen-specific immune responses by CD4${}^{+}$ T cells requires the interaction
of their TCR with MHCII-peptide complexes displayed on antigen presenting cells (APC) (8). These APC are specialized for the MHCII-mediated presentation of peptides derived from the internalization and processing of exogenous protein antigens. Finally, the life span of CD4⁺ T cells in the periphery is influenced by interactions with cells expressing MHCII molecules (7). Given these key functions of MHCII molecules, it is not surprising that defects in their expression have severe immunopathological consequences. The inability to express MHCII molecules leads to a severely crippled immune system that is incapable of responding adequately to foreign antigens (1–5). In contrast, aberrant or inappropriate MHCII expression has been incriminated in certain CD4⁺ T cell-mediated autoimmune diseases (9). These two points emphasize the importance of correctly regulated MHCII expression for the control of the immune response in health and disease. For nearly two decades, a detailed elucidation of the molecular mechanisms that regulate MHCII expression has therefore represented a major challenge in molecular immunology.

Constitutive MHCII expression is generally restricted to a small number of cells of the immune system (4, 10–13). These include primarily bone marrow-derived APCs, namely dendritic cells (DCs), B cells, and cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage. MHCII expression is also characteristic of epithelial cells in the thymus. Finally, in humans, activated T cells express MHCII. Constitutive expression in all three APC lineages is regulated as a function of developmental stage. Maturation of DCs is accompanied by an increase in cell surface MHCII expression. Activation of macrophages by stimuli such as interferon gamma (IFNγ) also leads to enhanced MHCII expression. In contrast, MHCII expression is extinguished upon differentiation of B cells into plasma cells.

The majority of non-bone marrow-derived cell types generally do not express MHCII molecules. However, MHCII expression can be induced in these cells by a variety of stimuli, of which IFNγ is most potent and well known. IFNγ-induced MHCII expression can be further modulated by a diverse array of other influences. For example, TGFβ, IFNβ, TNFα, IL-1, infection by a variety of pathogens, and certain drugs can attenuate or block the induction of MHCII expression by IFNγ.

Both constitutive and IFNγ-induced MHCII expression are controlled primarily at the level of transcription by a highly conserved regulatory region situated within the first 150 base pairs upstream of the transcription initiation site (4, 10–13). This promoter proximal regulatory region consists of four *cis*-acting elements referred to as the S (also called W or Z), X, X2, and Y boxes. These four elements are highly conserved in their sequence, orientation, order, and spacing relative to each other, and they function together as a single composite MHCII regulatory module (4, 11–13). The same architecture is evident in the promoters of all MHCII genes from every species that has been examined. A similar arrangement has also been conserved in the promoter regions of the MHCII-related *Ii*, *HLA-DM*, and *HLA-DO* genes (14–19), which code for proteins implicated in the intracellular traffic and peptide loading of MHCII molecules (20–22). Finally, it has recently also been appreciated that a region resembling the MHCII regulatory module

contributes, albeit to a lesser extent, to expression of the MHC class I (MHCI) and  
β2 microglobulin (B2M) genes (23–27).

With the aim of dissecting the molecular mechanisms regulating transcription  
of MHCII genes, a considerable amount of effort has been devoted to the identification  
of transcription factors that bind to the MHCII regulatory module. Over 20  
different nuclear factors capable of binding in vitro to the S, X, X2, and Y boxes  
were identified and/or cloned (4, 10–13). This complexity led to considerable  
confusion and controversy regarding the functional relevance and importance of  
all these MHCII promoter-binding factors. Distinguishing the factors that control  
transcription of MHCII genes from those that are functionally irrelevant represented  
a formidable task. This problem was solved to a large extent by a genetic  
approach. This genetic approach relied on the elucidation of the molecular defects  
underlying the absence of MHCII expression in the bare lymphocyte syndrome  
(BLS). Isolation of the genes that are defective in BLS has led to the unequivocal  
identification of CIITA and the multiprotein RFX complex, two key regulatory  
factors that activate transcription of the genes encoding the MHCII, HLA-DM,  
HLA-DO, II, and MHCI molecules (28–34).

PART 1: MHCII Deficiency or the Bare  
Lymphocyte Syndrome

Clinical Manifestations and Pathology

Patients suffering from a primary immunodeficiency syndrome characterized by  
a defect in MHC expression were first reported in the late 1970s and early 1980s  
(35–40). Curiously, the term BLS (41) was initially used to describe a reduced  
level of MHCI molecules in patients in which MHCII expression was not examined. Since then, a constant and profound defect in MHCII expression has been  
recognized as the major cause of the syndrome, and the disease was thus formally  
named MHCII deficiency by the World Health Organization (42). However, the  
term BLS is still widely used as a synonym for MHCII deficiency. The disease has  
been assigned the MIM (Mendelian Inheritance in Man) number 209920.

BLS is a rare autosomal recessive disease. Fewer than 80 patients coming from  
about 60 unrelated families have been formally reported worldwide. As expected  
for a rare inherited disease, there is a high incidence of consanguinity in the affected  
families (43). A majority of the affected families are from North Africa, but Turkey  
and Spain are also well represented (1, 3, 43).

The lack of expression of MHCII antigens results in a severe defect in both cellular and humoral immunity, and the patients thus exhibit an extreme vulnerability  
to infections (1–3, 5). This includes viral, bacterial, and fungal as well as protozoal  
infections. Clinical manifestations typical of BLS include mainly recurrent infections of the gastrointestinal tract, pneumonia, and bronchitis. Severe septicemia  
is also common. Multiple infectious agents are responsible for the infections.

Pseudomonas and Salmonella, as well as cytomegalovirus, are found frequently. Major clinical findings resulting from bacterial infections of the gastrointestinal tract are protracted diarrhea, malabsorption, and failure to thrive. Infections start within the first year of life, and there is a dramatic progression of various types of infectious complications, generally leading to death before the age of 10. All of the clinical manifestations of the disease are related to infections and presumably result from the lack of MHCII expression. From a clinical point of view, no distinction has been made between BLS patients belonging to the four genetic complementation groups (see below). The most common clinical manifestations of BLS are summarized in Table 1. A more detailed presentation of the clinical picture of BLS can be found elsewhere (1–3, 5).

## Laboratory Findings and Immunological Features

The most striking and constant immunological feature of BLS is the absence of cellular and humoral immune responses to foreign antigens (1–3, 5). Interestingly, all of the immunological features and anomalies recognized in BLS patients can be accounted for by the lack of MHCII expression and by its consequences in terms of antigen presentation. Surprisingly, the immunological anomalies exhibited by BLS patients, including their laboratory parameters, are notoriously variable from patient to patient. However, as observed for the clinical manifestations, no correlation has been recognized with the four distinct genetic groups of patients defined by the individual regulatory genes that are affected (see below).

Detailed accounts of the immunological features and laboratory findings typical of BLS have been published previously (1–3, 5). Patients are unable to mount T cell-mediated immune responses in vivo, and their T cells are not activated in vitro by antigens to which the patients have been exposed. Humoral immune responses are also severely affected: Hypogammaglobulinemia is characteristic, and antibody responses to immunizations and infections are reduced or absent (Table 1). The total numbers of circulating T and B lymphocytes is normal, but the number of CD4⁺ T lymphocytes is reduced (Table 1). The severity of this reduction varies from patient to patient. The remaining CD4⁺ T lymphocytes do not exhibit major abnormalities in their TCR repertoire, and they seem to be functionally normal as judged by alloreactivity and responses to mitogens. Their physiological responses to MHCII mediated antigen presentation have however not been studied thoroughly. The presence of a significant number of residual CD4⁺ T lymphocytes in patients that fail to express MHCII molecules remains an interesting paradox. Residual expression of MHCII molecules in the thymus, although not clearly documented, or alternative pathways for positive selection of CD4⁺ T cells, have been mentioned as possible explanations (see below).

## Abnormal Expression of MHCII Genes

Since the initial descriptions of the disease, understanding the cause of BLS has represented a challenge for immunologists interested in the crucial role of MHCII and of its remarkably tight regulation in the control of the immune response.

Numerous research groups therefore turned to the study of the molecular basis of BLS as a way to learn more about the regulation of MHCII expression. Here we describe the progress that was made toward this goal in a chronological order, as a succession of logical experimental milestones. We are very grateful for the long-term collaborations between our laboratory and those who provided the BLS cell lines that made our studies possible, particularly the laboratories of C Griscelli (Paris) and M Hadam (Hanover).

As described in the Introduction, two distinct modes of MHCII expression are normally observed in healthy individuals: constitutive expression in a restricted number of highly specialized cells, and inducible expression in response to specific stimuli, particularly IFNγ. In BLS, both constitutive and inducible expression of MHCII antigens abolished (1–3, 5). The lack of cell surface MHCII molecules is evident on all professional antigen-presenting cells, including B cells, macrophages such as Kupfer cells in the liver, and dendritic cells such as Langerhans cells in the skin. Activated T cells remain MHCII negative. Moreover, cells that are not of bone marrow origin, such as thymic epithelial cells and endothelial cells, also lack MHCII molecules. Finally, cells from the patients do not express MHCII molecules following stimulation with IFNγ.

This general lack of cell surface MHCII expression was confirmed at the level of intracellular MHCII proteins (44). The next step was to show that no MHCII mRNA could be detected in any of the cell types and conditions studied (3, 44–46). It was further shown that the deficiency in expression concerned the α- and β-chain genes coding for the HLA-DR, HLA-DQ, and HLA-DP molecules, implying a general block in the expression of all MHCII genes (3, 44–46). More recently, a partial block in the expression of the MHCII-related genes encoding HLA-DM, HLA-DO, and the Ii chain was also described (15, 47, 48).

Occasional weak residual expression of MHCII antigens and mRNA has been reported in certain BLS patients (Table 1). This residual expression has been described both for constitutive expression in certain cell types and for inducible expression in response to IFNγ (1–3, 5). We have not observed such a leaky phenotype in most of the EBV-transformed BLS B cell lines that we have studied. In addition to the complete extinction of MHCII expression, a relatively minor reduction in the level of MHCI molecules has been observed in BLS (Table 1) (1–3, 5). Again, this reduction in MHCI is not evident, at least at the level of cell surface expression, in most of the typical BLS B cell lines that we have studied.

## BLS Is a Disease of Gene Regulation Involving Defects in “Transacting” Factors

The demonstration that BLS is a disease of gene regulation represented a key step in the elucidation of BLS. The fact that all MHCII genes were found to be silent first suggested that there was a general defect acting in trans on the entire gene family. To test this hypothesis we studied the affected families for transmission of both the disease phenotype and the MHC locus on chromosome 6 (3, 45). The two clearly did not cosegregate, indicating that the genetic defect(s) responsible for BLS reside outside of the MHC. It was the merit of the late Claude de Préval to publish these findings in a 1985 *Nature* paper entitled “A trans-acting class II regulatory gene, unlinked to the MHC, controls the regulation of HLA class II expression” (45). This statement was formally confirmed 8 years later when we identified and cloned the first trans-acting gene affected in BLS (29 see below). Another

important confirmation of the regulatory nature of the BLS defect came from cell fusion experiments demonstrating that MHCII expression can be reactivated upon fusion of MHCII negative cells affected in two different genes (see below) (43, 49–51). Finally, it was subsequently shown that MHCII promoters remain silent in functional studies performed in BLS cells (52, 53) and that nuclear extracts from BLS cells cannot support in vitro transcription from MHCII promoters (54). The realization that BLS is due to defects in regulatory factors specific for MHCII genes suggested that elucidation of the genetic basis of BLS was likely to lead, beyond the scope of the disease itself, to the discovery of genes and factors directly involved in the important but elusive molecular mechanisms controlling MHCII expression.

### Genetic Heterogeneity in BLS

The search for the genetic defects underlying BLS became even more exciting and challenging when it was found that the disease is genetically heterogeneous and that patients could be classified into four distinct complementation groups (Table 2, groups A to D). The conclusion that the disease is genetically heterogeneous was drawn from somatic cell fusion experiments performed with MHCII-negative cell lines derived from BLS patients (43, 49–51, 55). In certain combinations MHCII expression was clearly restored, indicating that the two cell lines belong to distinct genetic complementation groups. These studies revealed the existence of four

complementation groups (43, 49–51, 55). It is now known that the majority of patients (26 out of 42 families) belong to group B, while groups A, C, and D correspond respectively to 5, 5, and 6 unrelated families (Table 2) (56). In addition to cells from BLS patients, several in vitro-generated mutant MHCII-negative cell lines have also been allocated to the complementation groups. These include RJ2.2.5 (group A), G1B (group C), and 6.1.6 (group D) (Table 2) (49–51, 57–59). The identification of four genetic complementation groups strongly suggested the existence of genetic loci corresponding to four key MHCII regulatory genes. This greatly strengthened the interest in the genetic and molecular basis of BLS because it implied that elucidation of this rare disease should lead to the discovery of four distinct regulatory genes that are all essential and specific for the control of MHCII expression.

As mentioned earlier, none of the clinical, pathological, or immunological features observed in BLS patients is typical of or unique to one of the four genetic groups. The syndrome is therefore genetically heterogeneous but clinically and phenotypically homogeneous. There is, however, an interesting correlation between individual BLS groups and the ethnic origin of the patients: Patients from group B are predominantly of North African origin while those from group A are mainly Hispanic (43).

### Atypical Form of Deficiency in MHCII Expression

A family affected by an atypical and much less severe form of deficiency in MHCII expression has been described (60–62). Defective expression in the two patients from this family does not concern all MHCII genes equally. In B cell lines derived from these two patients, the HLA-DRB, HLA-DQB, and HLA-DPA genes are silent while the HLA-DRA, HLA-DQA, and HLA-DPB genes are expressed (62). Interestingly, the silent genes are present in one transcriptional orientation within the MHCII locus, whereas the active ones are found in the opposite orientation (62). This intriguing discordant pattern of expression remains unexplained. Impairment of the immune response is considerably less severe in the two atypical patients than in classical BLS (60, 61). This has been suggested to be due to the fact that the deficiency in MHCII expression does not affect all cell types to the same extent. Indeed, investigations of MHCII-dependent immune functions in these patients indicate the presence of competent MHCII positive APCs (60, 61). As expected from their unusual phenotype, the atypical patients represent a distinct medical and genetic entity compared to the classical BLS groups A to D (62). The molecular defect underlying this atypical form of immunodeficiency has not yet been elucidated.

### DNA-Binding of RFX Distinguishes Between Two Types of Molecular Defect in BLS

RFX (Regulatory Factor X) is a DNA-binding protein complex first identified in MHCII positive B cells on the basis of its ability to bind in vitro to the X box of MHCII promoters (30). Binding activity of the RFX complex was studiedextensively with nuclear extracts prepared from various wild-type and BLS cell lines (30, 54, 63). It was recognized rather early that two types of BLS defects could be defined on the basis of the presence of the RFX complex (Table 2). Binding of RFX was found to be normal in wild-type cells as well as in cells from BLS patients in group A. On the other hand, cells from patients in groups B, C, and D were specifically devoid of RFX binding activity. This observation indicated that the genetic defects in groups B–D affect the integrity or binding activity of the RFX complex, while the defect in group A is independent of RFX.

Interestingly, there is a tight correlation between the status of RFX binding activity in vitro and the state of occupancy of MHCII promoters in vivo (Table 2). This was analyzed either by mapping of DNaseI hypersensitive sites (64) or by in vivo footprint experiments (65, 66). BLS cells lacking a functional RFX complex (groups B, C, and D) exhibit a “bare” promoter phenotype in which the X, X2, and Y sequences of MHCII promoters are not bound by their cognate DNA-binding proteins (65, 66). In contrast, wild-type cells as well as cells from BLS patients in group A exhibit both normal RFX binding activity in vitro and normal MHCII promoter occupancy in vivo (65, 66). The fact that not only the X box, but also the X2 and Y boxes are unoccupied in vivo in the absence of RFX, points to a crucial role of RFX in facilitating overall promoter occupation. It is now clear that this is explained by the fact that RFX entertains strong cooperative binding interactions with other MHCII promoter binding factors (67–71), including the Y box binding factor NF-Y (72) and the X2 box binding factor X2BP (67). The importance of these cooperative protein-protein interactions in the specificity of gene activation is discussed further below.

### CIITA: The Regulatory Gene and Factor Affected BLS Group A

Paradoxically, although the deficiency in RFX offered an experimental approach toward the identification and cloning of the genes affected in BLS groups B–D, the first BLS gene and factor to be discovered was the one affected in group A (29). The strategy employed relied on the genetic complementation of RJ2.2.5, one of the in vitro generated cell lines classified in group A. Following transfection of RJ2.2.5 with a B cell cDNA library prepared in an episomal expression vector, plasmids capable of correcting the genetic defect were rescued from cells in which MHCII expression was restored. This approach led to the isolation of cDNA clones encoding the MHC class II transactivator CIITA (Figure 2) (29). The human gene (*MHC2TA*) encoding CIITA is localized on chromosome 16 (16p13) (Figure 1). The mouse gene (*Mhc2ta*) is situated in a syntenic region of mouse chromosome 16 (V Steimle, B Mach, unpublished data). This localization is consistent with previous experiments demonstrating that regulatory genes present on the human and mouse chromosomes 16 (the *AIR-1* locus) are required for expression of MHCII genes (73, 74). The entire intron-exon structure of the mouse *Mhc2ta* gene has been determined. It consists of 19 exons spanning 42 kb of genomic DNA

The three sequences constituting a GTP binding domain, the leucine-rich repeat domain (LRR), the acidic region (DE), and 3 segments rich in proline, serine, and threonine (P/S/T) are represented by grey boxes. Regions that function in activation of transcription, in recruitment to MHCII promoters, in nuclear localization, and as a dominant negative mutant are indicated. Mutations affecting the *MHC2TA* gene have been determined in four BLS patients (BLS-2, BCH, ATU, and Fern) and in the in vitro generated cell line RJ2.2.5. The effects of the mutations at the level of the CIITA protein are represented schematically.

(W Reith, B Mach, unpublished data). Defects in the *MHC2TA* gene account for patients in complementation group A (Figure 2). Expression vectors encoding CIITA can reactivate expression of all three MHCII isotypes when transfected into cell lines from complementation group A (29). Wild-type levels of *Ii*, *HLA-DMA*, and *HLA-DMB* expression are also restored (47, 75). Five different mutations of the *MHC2TA* gene have been characterized in BLS patients from group A (29, 56, 76–78). Both alleles of the *MHC2TA* gene are also mutated in RJ2.2.5 (29, 79).

## The Genes Encoding RFX, the DNA-Binding Complex Affected in BLS Groups B to D

Purification of RFX demonstrated that it consists of three subunits having apparent molecular weights of 75, 36, and 33 kDa (33, 54, 80). This suggested that defects in the genes encoding these three subunits were likely to account for the absence of RFX binding activity in cells from BLS groups B, C, and D. Isolation of the genes encoding the three subunits of RFX confirmed this interpretation (31–34).
We called these genes *RFXANK*, *RFX5*, and *RFXAP* and demonstrated that they are indeed mutated in BLS complementation groups B, C, and D, respectively (Table 2, Figure 3) (31–33).

**RFX5: The Regulatory Gene and Factor Affected in BLS Group C**  
*RFX5*, the gene encoding the largest (75 kDa) subunit of the RFX complex, was isolated by the same genetic complementation approach that led to the cloning of CIITA (32). Briefly, *RFX5* cDNA clones were isolated by virtue of their ability to restore MHCII expression upon transfection into SJO, a cell line derived from a BLS patient in complementation group C (32). *RFX5* derives its name from the fact that it is the fifth isolated member of a family of DNA-binding proteins capable of recognizing the MHCII X box (81). All members of this RFX family share a common motif called the RFX DNA-binding domain (Figure 3) (81, 82). The human *RFX5* gene is situated in a subcentromeric region of the long arm of chromosome 1 (1q21.1–21.3) (83). The corresponding mouse gene maps to a syntenic region of chromosome 3 (W Reith, unpublished data). The entire intron-exon structure of the mouse *Rfx5* gene has been determined and shown to consist of 10 exons (W Reith, unpublished data). Defects in *RFX5* account for the existence of complementation group C (Figure 3). Mutations in *RFX5* have been characterized in five patients from group C (32, 56, 83–85). A missense mutation has also been identified in G1B, an in vitro generated MHCII regulatory mutant (59).

**RFXAP: The Regulatory Gene and Factor Affected in BLS Group D**  
*RFXAP*, the gene encoding the second subunit of the RFX complex was identified using a biochemical approach (31). To isolate *RFXAP*, we purified the RFX complex, isolated its 36 kDa subunit, derived peptide sequences from this polypeptide, and then cloned the corresponding gene. The gene was called *RFXAP* (RFX Associated Protein) because it encodes a protein that interacts directly with *RFX5* (31). The human *RFXAP* gene is situated on the long arm of chromosome 13 (55). The genomic structure of the mouse *Rfxap* gene has been determined and shown to consist of only 3 exons (W Reith, unpublished data). Defects in the *RFXAP* gene account for complementation group D (Figure 3). Three different mutations have been identified in six unrelated families (31, 55, 56, 86). An in vitro generated mutant (6.1.6) has also been shown to contain mutations in *RFXAP* (31).

**RFXANK: The Regulatory Gene and Factor Affected in BLS Group B**  
*RFXANK* (also called *RFXB*), the gene encoding the last subunit of RFX, was also discovered thanks to biochemical approaches relying on purification of the RFX complex. It was identified on the basis of peptide sequences derived from the smallest 33 kDa subunit of RFX. We named the gene *RFXANK* because it encodes a factor containing a protein-protein interaction domain consisting of ankyrin repeats (Figure 3) (33). Subsequently, another group independently isolated the same gene and proposed the name *RFXB* (34). The human *RFXANK* gene consists of 10 exons spanning 9 kb of genomic DNA and is situated on the short arm of

chromosome 19 (19p12) (33, 34). Defects in the *RFXANK* gene account for patients in complementation group B (33, 34, 87), which contains over 70% of all known BLS patients (Figure 3). Transfection of the *RFXANK* cDNA into cell lines from group B restores expression of all MHCII isotypes (33, 34). The *RFXANK* gene was found to be mutated in 26 unrelated patients (33, 34, 56, 87, 88). Only seven different mutations were identified in these patients (Figure 3). One of the mutations was found in 19 unrelated patients, indicating the existence of a founder effect (87).

## Therapeutic Perspectives

### Carrier Detection and Prenatal Diagnosis for BLS
Prenatal diagnosis or carrier detection on a population-wide scale is not justified because BLS is a very rare disease. However, these procedures could be valuable for families in which patients have already been identified, or when a consanguineous union is envisaged in a high-risk population. Thanks to the identification of the molecular defects underlying BLS, mutated alleles of the *MHC2TA*, *RFXANK*, *RFX5*, and *RFXAP* genes can now be screened for directly. This will permit healthy carriers to be identified unambiguously and should allow the development of accurate and reliable procedures for prenatal diagnosis.

### Gene Therapy for BLS
Bone marrow transplantation (BMT) is currently the only curative treatment for BLS (89). Compared to other immunodeficiency syndromes, the success rate of BMT for BLS has been rather poor (89). This does not appear to be a peculiar characteristic of the BLS disease. Instead, it is likely to be due mainly to other criteria, such as diagnosis at a late age (89, 90). Identification of the affected genes has raised the hope that gene therapy will represent a potential alternative to BMT. Introduction of the wild-type *MHC2TA*, *RFXANK*, *RFX5*, or *RFXAP* genes into hematopoietic stem cells of BLS patients in complementation groups A, B, C, or D, respectively, would represent a logical therapeutic strategy. The *Mhc2ta* and *Rfx5* knockout mice (see below) will be invaluable for

**Figure 3** Structure, function, and mutation of the RFX subunits that are affected in BLS complementation groups B, C, and D. Schematic maps of the RFXANK, RFX5, and RFXAP subunits are shown. The acidic region (DE) and ankyrin repeat domain of RFXANK, the DNA binding domain and proline-rich segment of RFX5, and the acidic (DE), basic and glutamine-rich (Q) regions of RFXAP are represented as gray boxes. The regions that are required for complementation of BLS cells, for assembly and binding of the RFX complex, for cooperative binding between RFX and NF-Y, and for interaction with CIITA are indicated. Mutations in RFXANK, RFX5, and RFXAP have been characterized in BLS patients (Ra, BLS-1, EBA, FZA, B23, and B25 for RFXANK; Ro, SJO, TF/EVF, OSE, and SSI for RFX5; ABI, DA, ZM, and Sha/ShG for RFXAP) and in two in vitro generated cell lines (G1B and 6.1.6). The effects of the mutations at the level of the RFXANK, RFX5, and RFXAP proteins are represented schematically.

developing gene therapy procedures for BLS. Defective selection of CD4⁺ T cells, resulting from the lack of MHCII expression on thymic epithelial cells, might be anticipated to represent an obstacle to gene therapy for BLS. However, the fact that classical BMT can cure BLS suggests that restoring MHCII expression on non-bone marrow-derived cells, such as thymic epithelial cells, is not absolutely essential. Another potential concern is that the therapeutic transgene could induce ectopic or abnormal levels of MHCII expression, which could have deleterious consequences and compromise the success of gene therapy. This will probably not be a major problem for RFX5, RFXANK (the largest group of patients), and RFXAP, which are expressed ubiquitously at nonlimiting levels in all cell types. On the other hand, this may represent a major dilemma in the case of CIITA because expression of the MHC2TA gene is tightly regulated.

**Therapeutic Modulation of MHCII Expression** MHCII expression is severely impaired in BLS patients. The same is true for most cell types in the mouse models of the disease (see below). This implies that no bypass or alternative pathway can compensate efficiently for a deficiency in RFX or CIITA. Moreover, although there are indications that the specificity of RFX and CIITA is not as strict as previously believed (see below), the expression of MHCII genes remains the major system in which these transcription factors are essential. Because of these features, inhibitors of CIITA, RFXANK, RFXAP, and RFX5 would be anticipated to have an efficient and selective effect on MHCII expression. CIITA, RFXANK, RFXAP, and RFX5 may thus represent prime targets for novel immunomodulatory drugs having wide applications in situations in which inhibition of MHCII expression might be desirable or beneficial, such as organ transplantation, autoimmune diseases, and inflammation in general.

The immunogenicity and rejection of tumors can be enhanced by activating MHCII expression, alone or in combination with costimulatory molecules (91–94). This has raised hopes that the introduction of CIITA into tumor cells to activate MHCII expression might enhance tumor immunogenicity and contribute to the success of tumor immunotherapy. Experiments designed to address the validity of this approach have been initiated (95).

## Lessons from Mouse Models for BLS

Knockout mice that reproduce the molecular defects of BLS patients in groups A and C have been constructed by targeting of the *Mhc2ta* and *Rfx5* genes (96–99). Both of these models reproduce the major immunopathological characteristics of the human disease. There is a strong reduction of constitutive MHCII expression on professional APCs (B cells, DCs, and macrophages) and thymic epithelial cells. Induction of MHCII expression by IFNγ is also abolished. The loss of MHCII expression results in a severely compromised immune system.

The CD4⁺ T cell population in *Mhc2ta* and *Rfx5* knockout mice is decreased at least tenfold (96–99). This strong reduction is a consequence of severely impaired

positive selection, which results from the loss of MHCII expression on epithelial cells in the thymus. Surprisingly, the reduction in CD4⁺ T cells is considerably less pronounced in the human disease; CD4⁺ T cell counts are rarely reduced greater than two- to threefold in BLS patients (1, 3). The reason for this discrepancy between the human and mouse phenotypes is not clear. One plausible explanation is that positive selection in the human disease is compromised only partially because low levels of residual MHCII expression are retained in the thymus. Whether or not this explanation is valid remains to be determined because MHCII expression patterns in the thymus have been examined only in a few isolated cases (100, 101). A second possibility is that the CD4⁺ T cells in BLS patients have escaped the normal thymic selection processes. They could for example have been selected on ligands other than MHCII molecules. In MHCII deficient mice, a large proportion of the residual CD4⁺ T cells are CD1-restricted (102). Such alternative selection pathways could be more prominent in BLS patients. Interestingly, an analysis of the T cell repertoire in BLS patients has revealed minor alterations, suggesting that the CD4⁺ T cells in these patients may indeed have been subjected to unusual selection mechanisms (103, 104).

The *Mhc2ta*⁻/⁻ and *Rfx5*⁻/⁻ mice exhibit residual MHCII expression in certain cell types (Table 3). This implies that there are alternative pathways for MHCII expression that bypass partially the strict requirement for RFX5 and/or CIITA.

(96, 97, 99). The precise pattern of residual MHCII expression differs between $Mhc2ta--/--$ and $Rfx5--/--$ mice (Table 3). Residual MHCII expression in the $Mhc2ta--/--$ mice concerns mainly a subset of thymic epithelial cells, dendritic cells in the paracortex of lymph nodes, and B cells in the germinal centers of the spleen and lymph nodes. In contrast, $Rfx5--/--$ mice retain strong MHCII expression on dendritic cells in the thymic medulla and significant, albeit weaker, expression on a fraction of splenic and bone marrow-derived dendritic cells. Low MHCII expression is also induced on $Rfx5--/--$ B cells activated with LPS and/or IL-4. This difference in the residual expression pattern is surprising because the human disease is phenotypically homogeneous. Although low expression has been observed in cells from certain BLS patients, no distinctive residual expression pattern discriminating between patients lacking RFX5 and CIITA has been described (1–3). This discrepancy between the human disease and the mouse models could reflect species-specific differences in the function of the two MHCII regulatory genes. However, it is also possible that phenotypic differences in residual MHCII expression exist in the human disease as well but have escaped attention because not enough patients have been examined in detail.

## PART 2: MOLECULAR BASIS FOR THE REGULATION OF MHCII EXPRESSION

### The RFX DNA-Binding Complex

Elucidation of the molecular defects underlying BLS complementation groups B, C, and D demonstrated that RFX is a multimeric complex consisting of RFXANK, RFX5, and RFXAP, three unrelated subunits sharing no sequence homology (Figure 3) (31–34). The stoichiometry of the three subunits within the RFX complex remains to be determined. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments performed with nuclear extracts, as well as with recombinant proteins, have indicated that the RFX complex is preassembled in solution prior to binding to DNA (33, 105, 106). All three subunits are essential for assembly of RFX (33, 105, 106). A deficiency in any one of the three subunits results in the inability to assemble a functional complex, which explains the absence of RFX binding activity in cells from complementation groups B, C, and D. It is unlikely that RFX contains additional unidentified subunits because a complex indistinguishable from the native protein can be assembled in vitro from recombinant RFX5, RFXAP, and RFXANK (105, 106).

All three RFX subunits can be cross-linked to the DNA within the X box cis-acting sequence (107). It remains unknown how RFXAP and RFXANK contribute to binding of RFX. On the other hand, RFX5 contains a well-known DNA binding domain (DBD), called the RFX domain (32, 81, 82). The RFX domain has been identified in a variety of DNA-binding proteins having diverse regulatory functionsin organisms ranging from yeast to human (81, 82, 108–110). The structure of the RFX domain of one member of the RFX family (RFX1) has recently been determined and shown to belong to the winged helix subfamily of the helix-turn-helix (HTH) proteins (111). Surprisingly, the RFX1 DBD binds DNA in a fashion radically different from that observed for all other known HTH proteins. Instead of relying on a recognition helix, the RFX1 DBD makes unprecedented use of a β-hairpin (called the wing) to recognize its binding site (111). The amino acids implicated in site-specific binding of the RFX1 DBD are strongly conserved in RFX5, implying that the latter interacts with its X box target site in a similar fashion (111).

Functionally essential domains within RFXANK, RFX5, and RFXAP have been defined (Figure 3) (105, 106, 112, 113) (W Reith, unpublished data). The minimal essential region of RFXANK encompasses a C-terminal region containing a protein-protein interaction domain consisting of ankyrin repeats. This region is essential for assembly and binding of the RFX complex and for activation of MHCII promoters. All of the RFXANK mutations identified in BLS patients remove or affect the integrity of this minimal functional domain. The minimal region of RFX5 covers an internal segment containing the DBD and a proline rich region. This region is sufficient for assembly and binding of the RFX complex, cooperative binding with NF-Y (see below) and interaction with CIITA (see below). All of the RFX5 mutations identified in BLS patients lead to deletion of the DBD and/or the proline rich region. In the case of RFXAP, the minimal region is restricted to a short C-terminal domain spanning a glutamine rich region. This region of RFXAP is sufficient for assembly and binding of the RFX complex and for activation of MHCII promoters. All of the mutations identified in BLS patients lead to the loss of this essential C-terminal region.

Several interesting features within the subunits of RFX appear to be dispensable for function (105, 106, 112, 113) (W Reith, unpublished data). RFXAP contains an N-terminal acidic region and a centrally placed basic region resembling a nuclear localization signal. Both of these regions can be removed without significantly affecting the function of RFXAP. The N-terminus of RFXANK contains an acidic region that has been suggested to be a PEST (proline/glutamic acid/serine/threonine) domain (34). PEST domains are frequently found in proteins that have short half-lives (114). Whether or not this region functions as a PEST domain remains to be determined. However, it is clearly not essential because it can be removed without eliminating the function of RFXANK.

## RFX Promotes Assembly of an MHCII Enhanceosome Complex

One of the major roles of RFX is to promote stable binding of other transcription factors to MHCII promoters (Figure 5a). Strong evidence for this was first provided by DNaseI hypersensitivity studies and in vivo footprint experiments examining
the occupation of MHCII promoter in B cells that express or lack RFX (64–66). All of the critical *cis*-acting sequences of MHCII promoters are occupied by their cognate DNA-binding proteins in RFX-positive B cells (wild-type cells and cells from BLS complementation group A) (Figure 4). In RFX-deficient B cells (BLS complementation groups B-D), on the other hand, MHCII promoters are bare (Figure 4) (64–66). This defect in occupation is not restricted to the X box target site of RFX. Instead, the X2 and Y boxes are also unoccupied, indicating that

**MHCII positive B cell**

**BLS complementation groups B, C, D**

![Diagram](attachment:diagram3.png)

stable occupation of these sequences by their cognate DNA-binding factors is dependent on binding of RFX to the adjacent X box. Subsequent experiments explained this observation by demonstrating that RFX binds cooperatively (67–71, 115) with the Y box binding protein NF-Y (72) and the X2 box binding factor X2BP (67), which has recently been suggested to contain CREB (116) (Figure 5a). Cooperative binding interactions between these three proteins leads to the assembly of a remarkably stable higher order protein-DNA complex at MHCII promoters (67–71, 115).

In addition to enhancing stability, the cooperative interactions are also specific, thereby ensuring that the X, X2, and Y boxes are bound in vivo by RFX, X2BP (CREB), and NF-Y rather than by the multitude of other factors capable of binding to these sequences with comparatively low affinity in vitro. It is of particular relevance here that several other members of the X box binding family of proteins can bind to the X box in vitro, but fail to interact with X2BP or NFY, and thus fail to stabilize the multiprotein complex on MHCII promoters in vivo. These other X box binding proteins (RFX1 to RFX4) control other genes, by binding to X box sequences flanked by protein-binding motifs distinct from those found in MHCII promoters (81, 82, 108–110)

The higher order nucleoprotein complex that assembles at MHCII promoters has recently been coined the MHCII ‘enhanceosome’ (115). The requirement for the assembly of this enhanceosome explains the observation that the S, X, X2, and Y sequences function together as a single composite regulatory module in which correct spacing and stereospecific alignment is critical (71, 117, 118). Protein domains mediating cooperative binding interactions within the MHCII enhanceosome have begun to be defined. A region situated immediately downstream of the proline-rich segment of RFX5 mediates cooperative binding between RFX and

---

**Figure 4** Molecular defects in the bare lymphocyte syndrome. A typical MHCII promoter containing the conserved S, X, X2, and Y sequences is depicted. The in vivo promoter occupancy and transcription status (+ or –) are shown for wild-type MHCII positive B cells and for B cells from BLS patients in complementation groups A, B, C, and D. Key transcription factors controlling promoter activity are indicated. RFX, X2BP, and NF-Y bind cooperatively to the X, X2, and Y sequences to form a highly stable nucleoprotein complex referred to as the MHCII enhanceosome. Proteins binding to the S box (?) remain poorly characterized. CIITA is a non-DNA-binding coactivator that is recruited to the promoter via protein-protein interactions with the DNA-binding components of enhanceosome. Proteins binding to the S (?), X (RFX), X2 (X2BP), and Y (NF-Y) boxes are all required for CIITA recruitment. CIITA activates transcription via N-terminal transcription activation domains (AD). The gene encoding CIITA is mutated in BLS patients in complementation group A. Mutations in CIITA do not affect assembly of the enhanceosome, and promoter occupation is consequently not modified. The genes that are defective in complementation groups B, C, and D, encode, respectively, the RFXANK, RFX5, and RFXAP subunits of RFX. In contrast to defects in CIITA, mutations in RFXANK, RFX5, or RFXAP disrupt assembly of the enhanceosome and thus lead to a bare promoter.

NF-Y (105). At the level of NF-Y, the minimal evolutionarily conserved regions comprising the DNA-binding domain are sufficient for cooperative binding with RFX (106). The regions within RFX and X2BP (CREB) that are implicated in their cooperative binding have not yet been mapped.

In addition to the crucial role of the MHCII enhanceosome in enhancing the stability and specificity of promoter occupation, it has very recently also been shown that this enhanceosome constitutes a platform onto which the transcriptional coactivator CIITA is recruited via protein-protein interactions (Figures 4 and 5, see above) (115). Association of CIITA with the MHCII enhanceosome

(b) protein-protein interactions with CIITA

is mediated by synergistic contacts with multiple components of the enhanceosome, including factors binding to the S, X, X2, and Y sequences (see below) (112, 113, 115, 119).

# The Non-DNA-Binding Coactivator CIITA

The gene encoding CIITA was isolated by virtue of its ability to correct the genetic defect in cell lines from BLS complementation group A (29). Although this genetic approach provided irrefutable evidence that CIITA is a crucial transactivator of MHCII genes, it provided frustratingly little information on how it achieves this. A considerable amount of effort has consequently been devoted to the elucidation of the mode of action of CIITA.

Several clues concerning the mode of action of CIITA are embedded in the primary sequence of the protein, which exhibits four major features of interest (Figure 2). First, the N terminus of the protein contains a region rich in acidic amino acids. Second, downstream of this acidic region lie three segments rich in proline, serine, and threonine (PST). Third, there is a centrally placed GTP binding domain that contains three characteristic sequences, a Walker A motif (also known as a P-loop) involved in nucleotide binding, a magnesium binding site, and a sequence that is believed to confer GTP binding specificity. Finally, there is a leucine rich repeat (LRR)-based protein-protein interaction motif near the C terminus of the protein. All four features are conserved between human and mouse CIITA and are necessary for the ability of the protein to activate MHCII promoters (120–125).

The acidic and PST regions found within the N-terminal portion of CIITA resemble the transcription activation domains typically found in mammalian transcription factors. Several observations support the notion that these regions of

**Figure 5** Mode of action of RFX and CIITA. (a) RFX participates in cooperative binding interactions required for promoter occupation in vivo. (Top) When bound individually, RFX, X2BP, and NF-Y have only low affinity (thin open arrows) for their respective X, X2, and Y box target sites. (Middle) Their binding affinity is strongly enhanced (thick black arrows) when the three proteins bind cooperatively to the same MHCII promoter fragment. (Bottom) In RFX-deficient BLS cells, cooperative binding is lost, and the residual low binding affinity of X2BP and NF-Y are not sufficient for stable promoter occupation in vivo. (b) CIITA is a non-DNA-binding transcriptional coactivator that functions at MHCII promoters via protein-protein interactions. Tethering of CIITA to MHCII and related promoters requires protein-protein interactions (arrows) with an as yet poorly defined S box binding protein, the RFXANK and RFX5 subunits of RFX, an X2 box binding protein (CREB), and the B and C subunits of NF-Y. Once tethered to the promoter, CIITA is believed to activate transcription by recruiting (arrows) other factors via its N-terminal activation domains (AD). Candidate factors recruited by CIITA include TFIIB, TAFⅡ32, TAFⅡ70, TFIIH, p-TEFb, and CBP. The putative effects of these factors on transcription initiation, elongation, and chromatin remodeling are indicated.CIITA actually serve as bona fide transcription activation domains (Figure 2). First, they are essential for the ability of CIITA to activate MHCII promoters, and their deletion generates dominant negative mutants of CIITA (120, 121, 123, 124, 126, 127). Second, the acidic region can function as an activation domain when it is grafted onto a heterologous DNA-binding protein such as GAL4 (124). Finally, the function of N-terminally deleted versions of CIITA can be partially rescued by fusing them to the activation domains of the transcription factors VP16 and TIF (124, 125).

At least three different mechanisms have been put forward to explain how the activation domains of CIITA stimulate transcription (Figure 5b). First, CIITA can interact with the general transcription factors TFIIB, hTAFⅡ32, and hTAFⅡ70, suggesting that it promotes transcription initiation by recruiting the general transcription machinery (128, 129). Second, CIITA has been proposed to enhance promoter clearance or transcription elongation by interacting with TFIIH or P-TEFb (129, 130). Third, CIITA may facilitate chromatin remodeling by recruiting the histone acetyltransferase CBP (131, 132). The latter mechanism could potentially explain why the accessibility of MHCII promoters to DNA-binding proteins is enhanced by CIITA in certain cell types (133, 134). These three mechanisms are not mutually exclusive, and CIITA could well function as a scaffold for the recruitment of several factors that activate transcription at different levels.

Very early on, it was recognized that CIITA does not activate transcription of MHCII genes by binding directly to the promoter DNA. This suggested that CIITA is a coactivator recruited to MHCII promoters by means of protein-protein interactions with one or more of the factors binding to the S, X, X2, and Y sequences (Figure 5b). Definitive evidence for this hypothesis has been provided only very recently (112, 113, 115, 119). Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments have revealed that CIITA is indeed physically associated in vivo with MHCII promoters (115), both several different MHCII promoters (HLA-DRA, HLA-DRB1, and HLA-DPB) and the promoters of the Ii and HLA-DM genes (115). Furthermore, in vitro recruitment experiments have demonstrated that tethering of CIITA to MHCII promoters is mediated by multiple synergistic protein-protein interactions with components of the MHCII enhanceosome (Figure 5b). Factors bound to the S, X, X2, and Y boxes are all required for recruitment of CIITA (115). Yeast two-hybrid and coimmunoprecipitation experiments have shown that CIITA interacts directly with the RFXANK and RFX5 subunits of RFX, the B and C subunits of NF-Y, and CREB (Figure 5b) (112, 113, 119, 135).

Domains within CIITA that interact with the DNA-bound factors have begun to be defined. It is clear that recruitment to the MHCII enhanceosome requires the C-terminal moiety of CIITA (Figure 2) (115). This is consistent with the earlier observation that the specificity of CIITA for MHCII promoters is conferred by its C-terminal portion (125). Moreover, domains mediating interactions with RFX5 and NF-YB have been mapped within this C-terminal region of CIITA (113).The LRR region is also important because mutations disrupting this region in BLS patients reduce the CIITA-enhanceosome interaction (115). Results concerning the importance of the N-terminal portion of CIITA for recruitment are less coherent. A recent study has defined the N terminus of CIITA as being the region that mediates interactions with RFXANK and NF-YC (113). This is at odds with the observation that this region is actually dispensable for recruitment (115). In fact, dominant negative mutants of CIITA lacking the N-terminal activation domains actually bind better to the MHCII enhanceosome, suggesting that these dominant negative mutants are likely to function by blocking access of wild-type CIITA to the promoter (115). Further work will be required to reconcile these contradictory findings.

Three regions within CIITA have been implicated in nuclear localization (Figure 2). First, the C terminus of CIITA contains a 5-amino-acid motif resembling a nuclear localization signal (NLS) (136). This NLS motif is essential for nuclear localization of CIITA and can direct nuclear import in a manner that is independent of other CIITA sequences. A 24-amino-acid deletion removing this NLS in the BLS patient BLS-2 aborts nuclear import of CIITA (136). A second sequence implicated in nuclear import is the GTP-binding motif. Binding of GTP appears to be required for transport of CIITA into the nucleus (137). Finally, a detailed mutational analysis of the LRR region has shown that it is important for directing CIITA to the nucleus (119). It remains to be determined whether these three regions are redundant and function independently of each other, or if they act together in a concerted fashion. Whether the nuclear-cytoplasmic distribution of CIITA is regulated also remains an open question.

CIITA shares a similar architecture and a low level of sequence homology with a set of other proteins. All of these proteins contain a nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) coupled to a LRR domain situated near the C terminus (138, 139). These other proteins have functions very different from that of CIITA. They include the caspase recruitment protein Nod1 and certain plant disease resistance proteins (138, 139). Conservation of the NBD-LRR domain organization in proteins having very different functions is intriguing. It is tempting to speculate that the similar structure of these proteins reflects an as yet unknown analogy in their mode of action.

## CIITA Is the Master Regulator of MHCII Expression

In contrast to the ubiquitous expression of the DNA-binding factors (including RFX) constituting the MHCII enhanceosome, expression of the *MHC2TA* gene is tightly regulated. In the majority of situations it is the expression of CIITA that dictates whether, and at what level, MHCII genes are expressed. The *MHC2TA* gene is therefore the master regulator of MHCII expression and hence has an essential immunomodulatory role. This conclusion has been firmly established by the following findings. First, the analysis of a large number of human and mouse cell linesand tissues has demonstrated that there is a strict correlation between MHCII and $MHC2TA$ expression. Second, the majority of cell types do not express $MHC2TA$ and are consequently MHCII-negative. Expression of the $MHC2TA$ gene, and thus of MHCII, can be activated in such cells by stimulation with IFN$\gamma$ (140, 141). This has been demonstrated in a variety of established cell lines, including fibroblasts, melanoma cells, and macrophages, and in several primary cell types such as mouse embryonic fibroblasts, peritoneal macrophages, microglia, and astrocytes (140–148). Transfection of MHCII-negative cells with CIITA expression vectors is generally sufficient to induce MHCII expression (140, 141, 149, 150). The latter point in particular emphasizes the fact that CIITA is both essential and sufficient, thereby justifying the notion that it represents the master regulator of MHCII expression. Third, experimental modulation of $MHC2TA$ expression using a tetracycline inducible system has shown that the level of $MHC2TA$ expression directly determines that of MHCII expression (151). Fourth, constitutive expression of MHCII in B cells and dendritic cells is sustained by constitutive expression of CIITA (29). Fifth, extinction of MHCII expression during the differentiation of B cells into mature plasma cells is caused by silencing of the $MHC2TA$ gene (149, 152). Sixth, MHCII expression is induced upon activation of human T cells because the $MHC2TA$ gene is switched on (A Muhlethaler-Mottet, B Mach, unpublished data). Activation of mouse T cells on the other hand does not turn on the $MHC2TA$ gene, and hence MHCII expression is not induced (153). Seventh, repression of MHCII expression in trophoblast cells is caused by inhibition of $MHC2TA$ expression (154, 155). Finally, an important emerging concept is that a variety of pathogens have developed the ability to inhibit CIITA expression—and thus MHCII expression—as a strategy to evade recognition by the immune system. Examples include cytomegalovirus (CMV) (156, 157), varicella-zoster virus (VZV) (158), *Mycobacterium bovis* (159) and chlamydia (160). This last point underlines the functional importance of CIITA as an essential immunomodulator.

Although the level of transcription of the $MHC2TA$ gene is in the majority of situations the dominant factor dictating MHCII expression, other levels of regulation have also been reported. The modulatory effects of IFN$\beta$ and TNF$\alpha$ on IFN$\gamma$-induced MHCII expression act downstream of $MHC2TA$ gene transcription (161–163). Moreover, weak or isotype specific MHCII expression has been observed in the absence of CIITA in certain mutant human cell lines (164) and in certain cell types in CIITA-deficient mice (Table 3) (96, 97). However, these examples of CIITA-independent MHCII expression remain exceptions, and the mechanisms involved are not yet understood.

## Regulation of CIITA Expression

The fact that the expression pattern of MHCII genes is determined primarily by that of CIITA has motivated substantial interest in the mechanisms controlling transcription of the $MHC2TA$ gene. A large (greater than 12 kb) and complex
regulatory region containing several independent promoters controls transcription of *MHC2TA* (Figure 6a). Four promoters (pI, pII, pIII, and pIV) have been identified in the human gene, three of which (pI, pIII, and pIV) are also strongly conserved in the mouse gene (145). The usage of these promoters leads to the synthesis of distinct CIITA mRNAs (types I, III, and IV) containing alternative first exons spliced to a shared second exon (Figure 6a) (145). The study of the different *MHC2TA* promoters has demonstrated that it is their differential activity that ultimately determines the complex expression pattern of MHCII genes that is observed in vivo (145). This has been confirmed in several biological systems (144–147, 162, 165–167). Different cellular and functional specificities of MHCII expression have thus been allocated to distinct CIITA promoters, each one having a specific physiological relevance (Figure 6a).

In both humans and mice, pI is highly specific for DCs. Type I CIITA mRNA typically represents a preponderant fraction of the total CIITA mRNA found in various different DC preparations (145, 165). This is for instance the case for splenic and thymic DCs isolated ex vivo from the mouse, DCs derived from mouse bone marrow cultures and human monocyte-derived DCs (145, 165; W Reith, B Mach, unpublished data). However, pI is not the only promoter active in DCs; there is generally also a variable but significant fraction of type III CIITA mRNA (145; W Reith, unpublished data). Moreover, DC specificity of pI is not absolute; it is also used in mouse microglia and peritoneal macrophages following activation with IFNγ (165) (JM Waldburger, W Reith, manuscript in preparation). Type I transcripts contain an alternative first exon that contains a translation initiation codon and codes for a specific 94-amino-acid N-terminal extension of CIITA (Figure 6a) (145). CIITA protein isoforms containing this type I specific extension are detected in DCs (W Reith, B Mach, unpublished data).

PIII is used primarily in B cells (145, 147, 166, 167). Sequences important for B cell specificity of this promoter have been defined (166). It should however be mentioned that the B cell specificity of pIII is not absolute. It is for example also used in certain DC preparations (145; W Reith, unpublished data). An IFNγ-responsive enhancer has moreover been mapped upstream of pIII in the human gene (146). Type III CIITA mRNA contains an alternative first exon that contains a translation initiation codon and encodes a specific 17-amino-acid N-terminal extension (Figure 6a) (145). CIITA protein isoforms containing this type III specific extension are detected in B cells (W Reith, B Mach, unpublished data).

PIV is activated by IFNγ in a wide variety of established cell lines and primary cell types, including monocytes, macrophages, microglia, astrocytes, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells (143–147, 168). The function of pIV has been dissected in considerable detail, which has permitted the complete signal transduction pathway from the IFNγ receptor to MHCII expression to be elucidated (Figure 6b) (143–147, 168). IFNγ-induced activation of pIV relies on three *cis*-acting sequences (a GAS element, an IRF binding site, and an E box) that function together

in synergy. The GAS and IRF sequences are bound, respectively, by STAT1 and IRF1 (144), two transcription factors that mediate IFNγ-induced gene expression in a variety of other systems (169–171). The relative contribution of STAT1 and IRF1 for pIV activation varies according to the cell type examined (146, 162). The E box is bound by USF1, a ubiquitously expressed transcription factor that binds cooperatively with STAT1 (144). Unlike the type I and III mRNAs, the type IV-specific exon does not contain a translation initiation codon and does therefore not encode an N-terminal extension (Figure 6a) (145). Translation of type IV CIITA mRNA is initiated at an initiation codon situated in the shared second exon (145).

To further refine the analysis of pIV usage we have excised it by gene targeting in mice (JM Waldburger, W Reith, manuscript in preparation). As expected, IFNγ-induced MHCII expression in pIV−/− mice is abolished in non-bone marrow-derived cells, including fibroblasts, astrocytes, hepatocytes, endothelial cells, and epithelial cells. Surprisingly, however, the excision of pIV does not eliminate MHCII expression in peritoneal macrophages and microglial cells following their activation with IFNγ. Thus, while pIV is essential for IFNγ-induced MHCII expression in non-bone marrow-derived cells, it is dispensable for MHCII expression in IFNγ-activated cells of the macrophage lineage. Enhanced MHCII expression in IFNγ-activated pIV−/− macrophages is due to the fact that pI is turned on in these cells. A second unexpected finding is that pIV−/− mice completely lack CIITA expression on epithelial cells of the thymic cortex. Since MHCII expression on these cells is essential for positive selection of CD4⁺ T lymphocytes (7), pIV−/− mice have very low CD4⁺ T cell counts.

Figure 6 Expression of the *MHC2TA* gene. (a) Several independent promoters drive transcription of the *MHC2TA* gene. Four promoters (pI, pII, pIII, pIV) have been identified in humans. Only three of these (pI, pIII, pIV) are conserved in the mouse. Usage of these promoters leads to the splicing (dashed lines) of alternative first exons to a shared second exon. Incorporation of exons I and III lead to the synthesis of type I and type III CIITA protein isoforms having specific N-terminal extensions of 94 and 17 amino acids, respectively. Translation of type IV CIITA is initiated at the AUG found in the shared second exon. The promoters exhibit different activities. pI is used primarily in human and mouse dendritic cells. It is also active in activated mouse macrophages and microglia. pIII is used mainly in B cells, but also to a variable extent in dendritic cells. pIV is essential for IFNγ-induced expression in non-bone marrow-derived cells, as well as for expression in thymic epithelial cells. (b) The entire signal transduction cascade mediating the induction of MHCII expression by IFNγ has been elucidated. Activation of Jak1 and Jak2 kinases by interaction of IFNγ with its receptor leads to the phosphorylation, dimerization, and nuclear import of STAT1. STAT1 binds cooperatively with USF-1 to a composite GAS/E box motif present in pIV of the *MHC2TA* gene. STAT1 also activates expression of IRF-1, which then binds to its cognate site in pIV. Activation of pIV by STAT1, USF-1, and IRF-1 leads to expression of CIITA, and thus to the induction of MHCII expression.
Induction of MHCII Expression: A Pathway  
Affected in Multiple Situations

pIV of the *MHC2TA* gene is turning out to be a privileged focal point for a growing number of influences that inhibit or abort MHCII expression, both under normal physiological situations and during the course of disease. First, a variety of cytokines known to inhibit IFNγ-induced MHCII expression, including TGFβ, L-4, IL-10, and IL-1β, have been shown to mediate their inhibitory effect by interfering with the induction of *MHC2TA* expression (142, 147, 168, 172, 173). Second, in trophoblast cells (154, 155) and in certain IFNγ unresponsive tumors (174, 175), the *MHC2TA* gene is refractory to induction by IFNγ. Third, the production of NO by activated macrophages inhibits IFNγ-induced activation of CIITA expression (176). Fourth, a number of pathogens, including cytomegalovirus (CMV) (156, 157), varicella-zoster virus (VZV) (158), *Mycobacterium bovis* (159) and Chlamydia (160) exhibit the ability to inhibit MHCII expression by interfering with the activation of CIITA expression. Finally, an emerging concept is that certain drugs can interfere with activation of MHCII expression. For instance, it has been shown very recently that the lipid lowering drugs statins inhibit IFNγ-induced CIITA expression (177). These various inhibitory effects likely converge on pIV of the *CIITA* gene, although evidence in support of this has been provided only for some of them (trophoblast cells, IL-1, TGFβ, CMV, Chlamydia, and statins) (142, 146, 147, 155–157, 160, 168, 172, 173).

So far, the molecular mechanisms underlying the inhibitory effect on activation of pIV by IFNγ have only been addressed in certain cases. In trophoblast cells, the lack of IFNγ inducibility of CIITA is due to methylation of pIV (155). The inhibition by CMV has been suggested to be due to enhanced proteasome-mediated degradation of Jak1, thereby limiting activation of Stat1 in response to IFNγ (156). Similarly, infection with VZV is associated with reduced levels of Stat1, Jak2, and IRF1, all of which would be expected to reduce induction of pIV (158). Finally, Chlamydia induces proteasome-mediated degradation of USF-1 (160), a ubiquitous transcription factor required for the activation of pIV (144). In addition to a reduction in the availability or activity of Stat1, USF1, or IRF1, other putative mechanisms could also be envisaged. A plausible target would, for example, be the cooperative binding interaction that takes place at pIV between Stat1 and IRF1 (144).

## Specificity of RFX and CIITA

The clinical and immunological phenotypes of BLS patients in all four complementation groups can be explained by the absence of antigen presentation via MHCII molecules. This has been interpreted to indicate that RFX and CIITA are highly specific for the expression of the MHCII genes (4). The finding that RFX and CIITA are also required for expression of the genes encoding Ii, HLA-DM, and HLA-DO (14–19, 47) did not really challenge this specificity because
these proteins are involved in the intercellular traffic and peptide loading of MHCII molecules. However, recent evidence has implicated RFX and CIITA in three other unrelated systems, demonstrating that their specificity for the MHCII system is not as tight as initially believed.

In addition to the profound deficiency in MHCII expression, a reduction in MHCI and β2 microglobulin is observed on various cell types from many BLS patients (Table 1) (1). Moreover, a reduction in MHCI expression has also been observed in *Rfx5*−/− mice; cell surface levels of MHCI in *Rfx5*−/− mice are lowered tenfold in T cells and two- to fivefold in B cells (W Reith, unpublished data). Taken together, these observations suggest that RFX and CIITA contribute to the expression of MHCI genes. This has been confirmed directly by several studies (23, 25–27) (W Reith, unpublished data). First, it has been established that *MHCI* and *B2M* promoters contain a region showing homology to the MHCII regulatory module consisting of the S, X, X2, and Y sequences (23–27). Second, RFX and CIITA can transactivate *MHCI* and *B2M* promoters in transient transfection experiments (23, 25–27, 178, 179) (W Reith, unpublished data). Third, certain BLS cell lines show enhanced levels of MHCI expression once their genetic defect has been corrected (26). Finally, chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments have demonstrated that CIITA and RFX are physically associated with MHCI and *B2M* promoters in vivo (115).

The existence of an additional gene affected by CIITA has been revealed by the analysis of *Mhc2ta* knockout mice. Expression of IL-4 is the hallmark of Th2 cells, whereas this cytokine is normally not expressed by Th1 cells (180). Disruption of the *Mhc2ta* gene has been reported to lead to the aberrant activation of IL-4 expression in Th1 cells (181), suggesting that CIITA is required for repression of the *IL-4* gene in these cells. This is apparently not due to a direct effect of CIITA on the *IL-4* promoter. Instead, CIITA expressed in Th1 cells has been proposed to bind to and sequester the coactivator CBP, which is required for transcription of the *IL-4* gene (182).

An interesting role of CIITA in HIV infection has recently been documented (130, 183). Expression of CIITA in T cells enhances HIV-1 replication and transcriptional activity of the HIV-LTR (183). This finding is of particular interest because the primary cellular targets of HIV—activated human T cells and macrophages—express high levels of CIITA. The mechanism by which CIITA activates the HIV-LTR remains obscure.

## The MHCII System as a Textbook Model for Regulation of Gene Expression

Thanks to elucidation of the BLS disease, the regulation of MHCII gene expression is one of the only mammalian transcriptional control systems that has been dissected genetically in detail (Figure 4). Moreover, several features make the regulation of MHCII genes a textbook model system for the regulation of gene expression. First, it represents an unprecedented paradigm for the role of gene-specific
coactivators such as CIITA (Figure 5b). Second, it is among the few examples in which strong evidence for the involvement of a higher order enhanceosome complex has been provided (Figure 4 and 5A). Third, the MHCII system makes a very strong case for the key importance of combinatorial control mediated by cooperative protein-protein interactions. Such cooperative interactions are crucial at three levels in the MHCII system. At the MHCII promoter, the stability and specificity of enhanceosome assembly is strictly dependent on cooperative binding between at least three different DNA-binding factors, RFX, X2BP, and NF-Y (Figure 5a). The specificity of the coactivator CIITA for MHCII promoters is mediated by the combined effect of multiple weak protein-protein interactions with at least six different components of the DNA-bound enhanceosome complex (Figure 5b). Finally, the IFNγ-induced expression of CIITA is dependent on the cooperative binding of Stat1 and USF1 to a composite response element in pIV of the *MHC2TA* gene (Figure 6b). Taken together, these features make the MHCII system a valuable blueprint of widespread interest to the field of regulation of gene expression.
