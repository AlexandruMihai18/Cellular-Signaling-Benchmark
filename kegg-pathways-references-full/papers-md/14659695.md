Cholera toxin (CT) and related AB₅-subunit toxins move from the plasma membrane through the trans-Golgi and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the cytosol of host cells. The toxins exploit a specific glycolipid pathway rather than a protein pathway. They bind glycolipids that associate with lipid rafts at the cell surface, which carry the toxins retrograde to the Golgi and ER. In the ER, the A1-chain of the CT unfolds and enters the cytosol by hijacking the cellular machinery that enables misfolded proteins to cross the membrane for degradation by the proteasome, a process termed retro-translocation. Upon entering the cytosol, the A1-chain rapidly refolds, avoids the proteasome and induces toxicity.

Cholera toxin (CT) produced by *Vibrio cholerae* is the virulence factor responsible for the massive secretory diarrhea seen in Asiatic cholera. To cause disease, CT must cross the intestinal epithelial barrier, which is normally impermeable to macromolecules. It does this by entering the epithelial cell directly after using a retrograde trafficking pathway from the plasma membrane to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). In the ER, the toxin hijacks the cellular machinery that enables misfolded proteins to cross the membrane for degradation in the cytosol (retro-translocation) [1,2]. The pathway followed by CT into the cytosol of host cells is almost a complete reversal of the biosynthetic pathway for secretory and membrane proteins.

Previous studies on the biochemistry of CT action as an ADP-ribosyltransferase have contributed fundamentally to our understanding of heterotrimeric G-protein function in eukaryotic cells, and to the identification of the ADP-ribosylation-factor family of small GTPases [3,4]. Here, we focus on results from recent studies that have elucidated a general pathway of glycolipid transport from plasma membrane to ER, and a mechanism for retro-translocation of misfolded proteins from ER to the cytosol. Both are essential features of eukaryotic cell biology.

## Toxin structure and function

Cholera toxin belongs to the AB₅-subunit family of toxins (Figure 1). Five identical 11-kDa peptides associate in a ring-like structure to form the pentameric B-subunit (~55 kDa). The B-subunit is a lectin that binds to

the oligosaccharide domain of a membrane glycolipid
receptor-ganglioside GM1—at the cell surface. It can
bind up to five gangliosides. The A-subunit assembles
non-covalently with the B-subunit and is cleaved into
A1-and A2-chains, which are linked by a disulfide
bond and extensive non-covalent interactions [5]. The
C terminus of the A2-chain protrudes through the
central pore of the B-ring and tethers the A-
and
B-subunits together. The extreme C terminus of the
A2-chain has an ER-targeting Lys-Asp-Glu-Leu
(KDEL) motif facing the membrane. The A1-chain
enters the cytosol and causes disease. It is an ADP-
ribosyltransferase that modifies the heterotrimeric-G-
protein, Gsα, to activate adenylyl cyclase. This induces
intestinal chloride secretion that causes the massive
secretory diarrhea seen in cholera.

The structure of CT typifies the structure of other
AB₅-toxins, including shiga toxin (Stx) and the
Escherichia coli heat-labile Type I and Type II toxins
(LTI and LTII) [6]. Like CT, these toxins also bind
membrane glycolipids, enter the cell by endocytosis, and
move in a retrograde way into the ER to induce disease
[7,8]. However, unlike CT, LTI and LTII, Stx does not
contain an ER-targeting KDEL motif.

Transport from plasma membrane to the ER of host cells
The first indication that a bacterial protein could move
backwards into the ER from outside the cell was observed
with Stx, which was visualized by electron microscopy in
the ER of toxin-sensitive cells [9]. It was then found that
the drug brefeldin-A completely inhibited the action of
ricin toxin, Stx and CT (for a review see [10]). Brefeldin-A
is known to disrupt the Golgi apparatus and ER membrane
transport. Furthermore, it was found that certain ER
luminal proteins were localized to the ER by displaying a
Lys/Arg-Asp-Glu-Leu ([K/R]DEL) motif at their C termi-
nus [11,12]. The [K/R]DEL motif binds the KDEL receptor,
ERD2, which cycles between the ER and Golgi thus
retrieving itinerant ER proteins from the Golgi apparatus.
Cholera toxin and all E. coli heat-labile toxins have
[K/R]DEL motifs located in a position on the molecule that
can bind to ERD2. Subsequently, mutagenesis of the motif
revealed that these toxins interact with ERD2 to affect
toxicity [13,14].

The pathway
Cholera toxin begins its journey into the cell by binding
the ganglioside GM1 at the cell surface [3] (Figure 2).
This binding to GM1 is a function of the CT B-subunit
that tethers the toxin to the membrane and results in
the association of CT with lipid rafts, specialized mem-
brane microdomains rich in cholesterol and glycosphingo-
lipids [15,16], which are required for toxin function
[8,17,18]. In several cell types, the toxin is internalized
by clathrin-dependent and -independent mechanisms
[10,19–21]. Following internalization, it can be found in
early and recycling endosomes, the Golgi apparatus and
the ER [22–24].
There is evidence to suggest that the A- and B-subunits
of the toxin separate in the Golgi apparatus, and that only
the A-subunit then moves to the ER by binding the KDEL

receptor, ERD2 [23,24]. However, two lines of evidence
indicate that this is probably incorrect. First, the KDEL
motif is not required for toxin function, although it
improves the efficiency of intoxication [13]. Second, recent
studies using a mutant CT B-subunit containing sulfation
and N-glycosylation motifs for the direct assay of toxin
entry into the Golgi and ER show that the lipid-raft
ganglioside, GM1, is responsible for transport into these
compartments [25]. The A-subunit is completely dispen-
sable for trafficking. However, binding of the toxin to any
membrane glycolipid is not sufficient for transport in this
pathway. The glycolipid must also associate with lipid
rafts. In intestinal cells, for example, the E. coli toxin
LTIIb, which binds to the non-raft glycolipid receptor
GD1a, does not move backwards to the Golgi or ER. Thus,
CT is transported from the plasma membrane to the ER by
a specific lipid-sorting pathway, rather than a protein-
sorting pathway (Box 1).

Mechanisms of transport
Perhaps the most informative studies of transport mech-
anisms from the plasma membrane to Golgi have been
performed using the Stx B-subunit or a mutant Stx
B-subunit that contains an attached KDEL motif
[26–29]. Shiga toxin can enter the cell by both clathrin-
dependent and -independent mechanisms, and moves
directly from the early endosome into the Golgi. The
pathway from early endosome to Golgi is partly regulated
by rab6a' and involves t- and v-SNARES (NSF attach-
ment-protein receptors on target and vesicle membrane,
respectively) localized in these compartments; it is
possible that CT follows the same route to the Golgi [21].
There is evidence to suggest that CT might move
backwards from the Golgi to ER by COPI-dependent
transport [22,24], a pathway that carries multiple protein
cargoes and, perhaps, the lipid-raft ganglioside as well
back to the ER. Other studies, however, indicate that the
raft glycolipids might follow a different pathway to the ER.
For example, Stx appears to travel backwards from Golgi
to ER independently of COPI-mediated mechanisms
[26,29]. One problem with these studies is that the
introduction of a KDEL motif to the Stx B-subunit
induces an interaction with the KDEL-receptor ERD2
that alters the trafficking of toxin from Golgi to ER. The
native Stx, which binds only to the membrane glycolipid
Gb3 and does not bind ERD2, could behave differently.
Nonetheless, the results of other studies using wild-type
Stx suggest that the efficiency of Stx trafficking into the ER
is affected by the lipid structure of Gb3 [30,31], which is
consistent with the view that the pathway that carries the
toxins backwards into the ER is indeed a glycolipid- and
not a protein-dependent sorting pathway.
Although CT does not need to bind the KDEL receptor
to move from plasma membrane to ER [25], it does interact
with the KDEL receptor to make its action more efficient
[13]. The lipid- and KDEL-dependent pathways might
work together in membrane transport through the Golgi.
In addition, once in the ER, the toxin can also move back to
the Golgi in anterograde vesicles, and the KDEL receptor
operates to return the toxin to the ER, enabling more
A1-chain to enter the cytosol. Mutation of the KDEL motif

Figure 2. The lipid-raft ganglioside GM1 carries cholera toxin (CT) from plasma membrane (PM) to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of host cells. (a) Pathway of CT transport from cell surface through the Golgi and ER to the cytosol. Like shiga toxin, CT might also move from the early endosome (EE) directly to the Golgi and then to the ER. In the ER, the A1-chain is recognized by the ER-chaperone, protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), unfolded, and delivered to the membrane where the membrane-associated ER-oxidase, Ero1, oxidizes PDI to release the A1-chain, possibly directly into the protein-conducting channel, Sec61. As the A1-chain moves into the cytosol, it rapidly refolds, avoids ubiquitination, and induces toxicity by activating adenylyl cyclase (AC). The resulting increase in cyclic AMP (cAMP) induces a Cl⁻ secretory response that causes the massive secretory diarrhea seen in cholera. (b) Configuration of the CT-ganglioside complex on (i) the plasma membrane and (ii) the Golgi and ER membranes. The glycolipid receptor ganglioside GM1 is the vehicle for transport of toxin from plasma membrane to ER. The toxin might bind the Lys-Asp-Glu-Leu (KDEL) receptor, ERD2, in the Golgi, but ERD2 is not required for transport into the ER. Once in the ER, the toxin can move anterograde to the Golgi where it can bind ERD2. Binding ERD2 recycles the toxin-ganglioside complex back to the ER, enabling more toxin to unfold and retro-translocate to the cytosol.

in CT interrupts this recycling pathway [25] and causes a loss in the efficiency of toxin action [13].

A general mechanism of retrograde transport from plasma membrane to ER

Recently, it was found that the raft glycolipids GM1 and GD1a are the functional receptors for simian virus 40 (SV40) and polyoma virus, respectively [32]. These viruses must also gain access to the ER to infect the host cell. Trafficking of SV40 into the cell displays many similarities to that of CT [22], including dependence on lipid rafts for initial uptake, and trafficking to the ER to induce activity. These similarities might be explained by the discovery that SV40 uses the same ganglioside receptor.

Almost all the bacterial toxins and the two viruses that require entry into the ER for toxicity use raft glycolipids as vehicles for transport into the cell; the one exception is Pseudomonas exotoxin-A (ExoA). This toxin binds the α2-macroglobulin or lipoprotein-like receptor, which carries ExoA into the Golgi apparatus [10]. Pseudomonas ExoA has a KDEL-like C-terminal sequence that might bind the KDEL receptor after removal of the C-terminal residue, and there is evidence to suggest that the KDEL receptor binds ExoA in the Golgi and carries the toxin from Golgi to ER [14].

Thus, there are at least two general transport pathways from cell surface to ER. One requires binding to the KDEL-receptor ERD2 in the Golgi apparatus, and the other requires binding to a glycolipid associated with lipid rafts at the cell surface. The glycolipid acts as the transport vehicle from plasma membrane to ER; this pathway is typified by the mechanism of CT transport.

Box 1. Mechanisms of ganglioside trafficking

The reason the glycolipid receptor ganglioside GM1, but not ganglioside GD1a, has the ability to transport cholera toxin (CT) backwards into the Golgi and ER in intestinal cells is probably associated with the structure of its lipid moiety (Figure 1). Gangliosides have two domains: an extracellular oligosaccharide domain and an intramembrane ceramide lipid. The gangliosides are classified based on the different structures of their oligosaccharides, but the ceramide domain can also show structural heterogeneity. For example, the sphingosine- and acyl-chains that form the backbone of the ceramide can have either one or no double bonds, and the acyl group can be a long or short carbon-chain. The structure of the ceramide domain probably defines the affinity of the molecule for association with lipid rafts [55]. However, raft association might not be sufficient for retrograde transport into the secretory pathway. For example, glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins also fractionate with lipid rafts, but there are conflicting reports as to whether these molecules undergo retrograde trafficking from plasma membrane to Golgi or into the endosome [56–58]. Thus, it is possible that only ceramide-based raft-glycolipids move retrograde from plasma membrane to ER.

Sorting of raft- from non-raft-glycolipids, and delivery of raft glycolipids into the retrograde pathway might depend on biophysical features of the lipid moiety that can influence its incorporation into certain membrane domains, vesicle buds, and tubules [59]. The toxins might further enhance these features by cross-linking up to five glycolipids simultaneously. It is also possible that specific components of the raft microdomain might function to couple the toxin-ganglioside complex with sorting machinery inside the cell that is necessary for retrograde transport. Such lipid-based sorting might occur at the plasma-membrane level (dictated by different mechanisms of endocytosis), or after arrival in the endosomal compartment, or both [20,21,60].

Why go to the ER? Retro-translocation of the A1-chain

Cholera toxin enters the lumen of the ER as a fully assembled protein complex [25]. Here, the A-subunit is reduced, and the resulting A1-chain is unfolded, disassembled from the rest of the toxin, and transported to the cytosol (Figure 3). In the ER, the toxin hijacks the machinery that monitors and degrades misfolded proteins [2,33–36]. This protein quality control system, termed ER-associated degradation (ERAD), normally ensures that terminally misfolded proteins in the secretory pathway are recognized, unfolded, and translocated to the cytosol for degradation by the proteasome (for a review see [1]). In the final step of this process, almost all known endogenous substrates for ERAD are polyubiquitinated in the cytosol for targeting to the proteasome. However, CT and perhaps other toxins do not share this last step [37].

The A- and B-subunits of CT are stably folded—even after proteolytic cleavage and reduction of the A-subunit, the A1-chain remains tightly bound to the B-subunit. Thus, disassembly of the A1-chain from the rest of the toxin requires unfolding of the peptide. This is accomplished by the ER-chaperone, protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) [35]. The unfolding reaction catalyzed by PDI is driven by a redox cycle rather than by an ATP cycle; in its reduced state, PDI binds and unfolds the A1-chain, and in its oxidized state, PDI releases the toxin [34,35]. It is probable that only the A1-chain is unfolded and dissociated from the B-subunit (Figure 3a).

Why then is the toxin folded and assembled in the periplasm of *V. cholerae*, but unfolded in the ER of target epithelial cells? This is because reduced PDI only binds and unfolds the A-subunit that is cleaved in the loop.

Figure 3. Retro-translocation of the cholera toxin (CT) A1-chain. The toxin enters the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) as a fully assembled protein complex but proteolytically cleaved in the A-subunit. (a) The reduced form of protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) recognizes the cleaved toxin, unfolds, and dissociates the A1-chain from the rest of the toxin. (b) The PDI–A1-chain complex is targeted to the luminal-side of the ER membrane where Ero1 oxidizes PDI to release the A1-chain, possibly directly into the protein-translocation channel, Sec61. (c) The unfolded A1-chain is transported across the channel, possibly driven by the energy of rapidly refolding as it emerges from the channel in the cytosol, or possibly by being pulled out of the channel by a cytosolic factor such as p97 AAA-ATPase. (d) The A1-chain refolds completely in the cytosol, avoids ubiquitination, and induces toxicity.

connecting the A1- and A2-chains [25,35]. Proteolytic cleavage at this site occurs in the intestinal lumen after secretion from V. cholerae, by serine proteases endogenous to either V. cholerae or the host. This cleavage acts as a molecular switch that targets the A1-chain for unfolding by PDI.

Protein unfolding is probably a general requirement for retro-translocation of toxins and all proteins that cross the ER membrane (although see [38]). Evidence supporting this idea comes from studies on ricin toxin. Introduction of disulfide bonds into the A-chain of ricin toxin stabilizes folding of the A-chain and reduces toxicity, presumably owing to an effect of the disulfide bonds on toxin unfolding and retro-translocation, although this was not measured directly [39]. Whether PDI is responsible for unfolding of the ricin A-chain or the A-chains of other toxins remains unknown. However, PDI and PDI-related proteins have been shown to mediate retro-translocation of several misfolded proteins [40,41], and act as a redox-driven chaperone in this process [42]. Thus, PDI and its family members probably represent a component of the general machinery used in retro-translocation.

Why are the toxins recognized as being misfolded after they arrive in the ER? Exposure of hydrophobic residues is probably the main reason. In CT, a subdomain of the A1-chain near its C terminus – termed the A1₃ domain – contains an extended hydrophobic sequence, which is proposed to serve as an essential motif for retro-translocation [2]. However, this motif is partially buried inside the fold of the native toxin [5], although it might be exposed after proteolytic cleavage of the A-subunit. The structure of the cleaved and reduced A-subunit is not known. Presumably, a conformational change occurs that renders the A1-chain a substrate for unfolding by PDI, and activates its enzymatic activity. However, the actual recognition motif remains to be discovered.

### Mechanism of retro-translocation

The next step in retro-translocation is targeting of the unfolded A1-chain to the translocation channel (Figure 3b). Recently, it was found that the PDI–toxin complex is targeted to the luminal surface of the ER membrane. Here, the membrane-associated ER-oxidase, Ero1, oxidizes PDI to release the unfolded A1-chain [34]. Because the A1-chain refolds spontaneously once it is released from PDI (see later), we propose that release of the toxin from PDI is mechanistically coupled to the retro-translocation channel, although how this occurs remains a mystery.

The protein-conducting channel that mediates retro-translocation of CT is not known with certainty, but there is strong evidence to suggest that this channel might be the same protein-conducting pore that functions in the biosynthetic pathway, Sec61 [36]. Over the past several years, it has become increasingly clear that several cellular proteins (including MHC class I and the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) when misfolded or modified by viral proteins, use the Sec61 channel for retro-translocation to the cytosol [43–45]. These seminal observations led to the idea that the toxins also use Sec61 to reach the cytosol and cause toxicity [2]. Experimental evidence in support of this idea was obtained by reconstituting the retro-translocation reaction for the CT A1-chain in rabbit reticulocyte lysates [46]. Other toxins that undergo retro-translocation, such as ricin and *Pseudomonas* ExoA, have also been found to interact with the Sec61 channel [47,48]. Thus, it appears that the Sec61 complex might be the common channel used by the toxins to exit the ER.

The driving force for retro-translocation of any protein remains unknown (Figure 3c). One possibility for endogenous proteins that are targeted for degradation might involve a ratcheting mechanism in which polyubiquitination plays a key role. Polyubiquitination of the polypeptide chain on the cytosolic-side of the ER membrane provides a bulky group that can prevent backsliding of the substrate into the ER lumen. However, this mechanism cannot be the only driving force for proteins that retro-translocate across the ER. Recent studies show that mutant CT lacking all lysines in its A1-chain, and with its N terminus blocked by carbamylation (which therefore cannot be ubiquitinated), is still able to undergo retro-translocation and induce toxicity [37]. The driving force for retro-translocation of CT might instead be based on the ability of the A1-chain to refold rapidly and spontaneously upon emerging from the channel [37]. Thus, the toxin might ratchet itself into the cytosol, or the rapidly refolding A1-chain might generate an active pulling force. Another possibility is that a downstream cytosolic factor might pull the A1-chain out of the ER membrane. A candidate chaperone that might serve this function is the p97 AAA-ATPase. This cytosolic chaperone, together with its co-factors, is responsible for extraction of several misfolded proteins during their retro-translocation [49,50], and it can interact with both polyubiquitinated and non-ubiquitinated substrates [49].

### Escape from proteasome degradation

Unlike misfolded endogenous proteins, the A1-chain of CT must avoid degradation by the proteasome for at least as long as it takes for the toxin to reach its substrate in the cytosol and induce toxicity (Figure 3d). There are two mechanisms by which this might occur. As in almost all other bacterial toxins, the A1-chain of CT has a paucity of lysines, which are the sites for polyubiquitination [2]. Some toxin A-chains have no lysines. Polyubiquitination is the primary motif for targeting proteins to the proteasome [51], but the proteasome can also recognize and degrade unfolded proteins in the absence of polyubiquitination [52]. Thus, it is probable that the paucity of lysines in the A1-chain, together with its ability to refold rapidly, protects the A1-chain from degradation in the cytosol [37].

The plant toxin ricin also has a paucity of lysines in its primary sequence [53]. However, in contrast to CT, the activity of ricin on cultured cells is moderately enhanced by proteasome inhibitors [53], implying that a fraction of the ricin A-chain is more efficiently targeted to the proteasome for degradation; the activity of wild-type CT is not sensitive to proteasome inhibitors [37]. As the E3 enzymes involved in polyubiquitination recognize unfolded proteins [54], it is possible that ricin has slower refolding kinetics after retro-translocation to the cytosol.

enabling its polyubiquitination or direct targeting to the proteasome.

**Concluding remarks**

We are just beginning to understand the pathways and molecular mechanisms responsible for retrograde transport from the plasma membrane to the ER, and retro-translocation of substrates across the ER membrane; however, many questions still remain. It will be crucial to identify the common structural elements of the glycolipids that carry the toxins and viruses from the cell surface to the ER, and to understand how the cell recognizes and sorts these lipids specifically into this pathway. Why does the cell move the raft glycolipids backwards into the ER, and how do lipid rafts participate in this process? We also need a better understanding of retro-translocation. How is the A1-chain targeted to the Sec61 channel after unfolding in the ER? Is the Sec61 channel the only protein-conducting pore that mediates retro-translocation, and what is the driving force for this process? How is the A1-chain released from the ER after movement into the cytosol? Answers to these questions will undoubtedly provide fundamental insights into basic cellular processes. Studies using CT and other related toxins will provide a unique and powerful approach to unraveling these secrets.
