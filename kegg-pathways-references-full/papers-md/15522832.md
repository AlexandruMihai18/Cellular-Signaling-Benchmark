### Abstract

In the yeast, three biosynthetic pathways lead to the formation of phosphatidylethanolamine (PtdEtn): (i) decarboxylation of phosphatidylserine (PtdSer) by phosphatidylserine decarboxylase 1 (Psd1p) in mitochondria; (ii) decarboxylation of PtdSer by Psd2p in a Golgi/vacuolar compartment; and (iii) the CDP-ethanolamine (CDP-Etn) branch of the Kennedy pathway. The major phospholipid of the yeast, phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho), is formed either by methylation of PtdEtn or via the CDP-choline branch of the Kennedy pathway. To study the contribution of these pathways to the supply of PtdEtn and PtdCho to mitochondrial membranes, labeling experiments in vivo with \[^3H\]serine and \[^{14}C\]ethanolamine, or with \[^3H\]serine and \[^{14}C\]choline, respectively, and subsequent cell fractionation were performed with *psd1Δ* and *psd2Δ* mutants. As shown by comparison of the labeling patterns of the different strains, the major source of cellular and mitochondrial PtdEtn is Psd1p. PtdEtn formed by Psd2p or the CDP-Etn pathway, however, can be imported into mitochondria, although with moderate efficiency. In contrast to mitochondria, microsomal PtdEtn is mainly derived from the CDP-Etn pathway. PtdEtn formed by Psd2p is the preferred substrate for PtdCho synthesis. PtdCho derived from the different pathways appears to be supplied to subcellular membranes from a single PtdCho pool. Thus, the different pathways of PtdEtn biosynthesis play different roles in the assembly of PtdEtn into cellular membranes.

### 1. Introduction

Phosphatidylethanolamine (PtdEtn) and phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho) are the most abundant phospholipids of eukaryotic cells, comprising 25% and 50% of cell phospholipid mass, respectively [1,2]. PtdEtn is the major non-bilayer phospholipid which causes non-leaky discontinuity in the overall bilayer structure of a membrane [3,4]. The ability to form hexagonal phases may influence membrane fusion and fission events, such as membrane vesicle formation during cell division and vesicle mediated protein trafficking. In eukaryotes, moreover, PtdEtn has been proposed to be the precursor for glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors linked to the carboxyl terminal amino acid of proteins [5]. GPI anchor biosynthesis is essential in yeast and is one of the processes requiring a minimal level of PtdEtn [6].

PtdCho is the major structural component of cellular membranes, but also serves as a precursor for several lipid second messengers, such as the bioactive lysoPtdCho, phosphatidate, and arachidonic acid. The essentiality of PtdCho for yeast was demonstrated by the observation that strains defective in both methyltransferases, Pem1p and Pem2p, are auxotrophic for choline (Cho) [7,8]. Yeast mutant strains with defects in the PtdEtn and PtdCho biosynthetic

routes have the tendency to generate respiratory-deficient petites at high frequency [6,9,10].

Two alternative pathways, namely the de novo or cytidyldiphosphate diacylglycerol (CDP-DAG) pathway, and the CDP-ethanolamine (CDP-Etn) and CDP-choline (CDP-Cho) branches of the Kennedy pathway lead to the formation of PtdEtn and PtdCho. In mammalian cells the Kennedy pathway is the preferred route of PtdEtn and PtdCho synthesis [11], whereas in *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* PtdEtn and PtdCho are preferentially synthesized by the de novo pathway (for a review see [12]). Routes of the biosynthesis of PtdEtn and PtdCho in the yeast are shown in Fig. 1. In brief, phosphatidylserine synthase (Cholp/Pss1p) forms phosphatidylserine (PtdSer) from CDP-DAG and serine (Ser) in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and related membranes [13]; decarboxylation of PtdSer occurs either by phosphatidylserine decarboxylase 1 (Psd1p) in the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) [14] or by phosphatidylserine decarboxylase 2 (Psd2p) in a Golgi/vacuolar compartment [15]; and methylation of PtdEtn by PtdEtn methyltransferases 1 and 2 (Pem1p/Cho2p, Pem2p/Opi3p) yields PtdCho [2,16,17]. Alternatively, PtdEtn and PtdCho are synthesized from free ethanolamine (Etn) or Cho either formed endogenously by lipolytic processes or imported into the cell from exogenous sources [18] by the choline transporter Ctrlp. Etn and Cho are phosphorylated by ethanolamine kinase (Eki1p) or choline kinase (Cki1p) [19,20], converted to CDP-Etn and CDP-Cho, and incorporated into PtdEtn and PtdCho by reacting with diacylglycerol [21,22].

The major pathway of PtdEtn formation in yeast appears to be the Psd1p route. Psd1p catalyzes approximately 80% of PSD activity in vitro [15,23]. A *psd1Δ* deletion mutant, while growing perfectly on defined glucose medium, cannot be cultivated on lactate or ethanol without supplementation of Etn, Cho or Ser [6]. Thus, PtdEtn production by Psd2p is not sufficient for growth on non-fermentable carbon sources, and enhanced PtdSer biosynthesis or the Kennedy pathway become essential. Loss of Psd2p activity does not affect cell growth. Lack of both PtdSer decarboxylases Psd1p and Psd2p turns the strain auxotrophic for Etn and/or Cho on glucose, but strictly auxotrophic for Etn on lactate [6]. On the fermentable carbon source glucose the minimum amount of PtdEtn can be provided through sphingolipid turnover as long as PtdCho is synthesized from Cho via the CDP-Cho pathway [6,24]. The dihydrosphingosine phosphate lyase Dpl1p cleaves phosphorylated sphingoid base to long-chain aldehyde and Etn-P [25] which can be incorporated into PtdEtn through the CDP-Etn route [26]. On nonfermentable carbon sources the requirement for PtdEtn is more stringent than on fermentable carbon sources, and the amount of Etn-P formed by Dpl1p is not sufficient for balanced synthesis of PtdEtn [6]. When yeast grows on lactate, PtdEtn synthesis by Psd1p becomes essential for efficient respiration. The growth rate on non-fermentable carbon sources directly paralleled the PtdEtn content of mitochondria.

To complement previous work from our laboratory [6] based on genetic evidence, we present here biochemical and cell biological evidence addressing the contribution of

We demonstrate that each pathway plays a specific cell biological role, not only as route of phospholipid formation in general, but also as a means of selective distribution of PtdEtn to subcellular compartments.

### 2. Materials and methods

#### 2.1. Strains and culture conditions

The haploid wild-type yeast strain S. cerevisiae FY1679 (*MATa his3Δ200 leu2Δ1 trp1Δ63 ura3-52*), the phosphatidylserine decarboxylase-deficient yeast strains YRB2 (*MATa his3Δ200 leu2Δ1 trp1Δ63 ura3-52 psd1Δ::KanMX4*) and YRB3 (*MATa his3Δ200 leu2Δ1 trp1Δ63 ura3-52 psd2Δ::KanMX4*), and strains MSS204 (*MATa dpl1Δ::LEU2 TPS2-LacZ leu2-3,112 ura3-52 trp1 his4 rme1*), YRB7 (*psd1Δ::KanMX4 dpl1Δ::LEU2 his3/4 leu2 ura3-52*) and YRB8 (*psd2Δ::KanMX4 dpl1Δ::LEU2 his3/4 leu2 ura3-52*) [6] were used in this study. All strains were cultivated in YPLac media (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% lactate, 0.1% glucose) under aerobic conditions at 30 °C to the late logarithmic growth phase.

#### 2.2. Radioactive labeling of lipids in spheroplasts

Spheroplasts were prepared by the method of Daum et al. [27], harvested by centrifugation, transferred to synthetic minimal medium [28] containing 2% lactate as a carbon source, 1 M sorbitol and buffered with 100 mM Na-citrate, pH 5.5 (regeneration medium), at a cell density of 100 mg wet weight/ml, and regenerated for 1 h with moderate shaking at 30 °C. Then, spheroplasts were labeled in regeneration medium for 30 min with 100 μCi [³H]serine (23.0 Ci/mmol) and 20 μCi [¹⁴C]ethanolamine (2.9 mCi/mmol), or with 150 μCi [³H]serine (23.0 Ci/mmol) and 10 μCi [¹⁴C]choline (54 mCi/mmol) per gram cell wet weight. After centrifugation at 4000×g for 5 min spheroplasts were immediately cooled on ice to stop cellular metabolism and used for cell fractionation (see below). Radioactive reagents were purchased from Perkin Elmer Life Science Products, Inc., Boston, MA.

#### 2.3. Cell fractionation

Spheroplasts were homogenized in breaking buffer consisting of 0.6 M sorbitol, 20 mM Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4, 1 mM PMSF, and 10 mM EDTA by using a Dounce homogenizer as described previously [14]. Unbroken cells and debris were removed by centrifugation at 3000×g for 5 min. The resulting supernatant (total homogenate) was used to isolate mitochondria, submitochondrial fractions and microsomes by published procedures [14,27]. Purity of isolated subcellular fractions was routinely tested by Western Blot analysis, using porin as marker for the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) [27], ADP/ATP carrier protein (Aac1p) as marker for the IMM, and Kar2p/BiP as marker for the ER [29]. The quality of the fractions was the same as described by Zinser and Daum [30].

#### 2.4. Analytical procedures

Protein was quantified by the method of Lowry et al. [31], using bovine serum albumin as standard. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was carried out by the method of Laemmli [32]. Western blot analysis was performed as described by Haid and Suissa [33].

Choline kinase activity was measured by following the formation of [¹⁴C]-labeled cholinephosphate from [methyl-[¹⁴C]]cholinechloride as described previously [34]. Ethanolamine kinase activity was measured in an equivalent assay using [¹⁴C]ethanolaminehydrochloride as a substrate. Cholinephosphate cytidylyltransferase and ethanolaminephosphate cytidylyltransferase activities were assayed by measuring the formation of [¹⁴C]CDP-choline and [¹⁴C]CDP-ethanolamine, respectively [35]. The activity of *sn*-1,2-diacylglycerol cholinephosphotransferase was assayed by the method of Kuchler et al. [36], and the activity of *sn*-1,2-diacylglycerol ethanolaminophosphotransferase as described by Morash et al. [37]. Phospholipase D1 activity was measured by assaying the hydrolysis of [methyl-[¹⁴C]]PtdCho yielding phosphatidic acid and choline as described previously [38,39].

Lipids from homogenate, mitochondria, mitochondrial subfractions and microsomes were extracted by the procedure of Folch et al. [40]. Individual phospholipids were separated by two-dimensional thin-layer chromatography (TLC) on Silica gel 60 plates (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) using chloroform/methanol/25% NH₃ (65:35:5; per vol.) as first, and chloroform/acetone/methanol/acetic acid/water (50:20:10:10:5; per vol.) as second developing solvent. Phospholipids were visualized on TLC plates by staining with iodine vapor and identified by using authentic standards. Radioactive spots were scraped off the plate, and radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting as described above. Phospholipids were quantified by the method of Broekhuyse [41].

### 3. Results

In wild-type cells, PtdCho, PtdEtn and phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) are the major phospholipid constituents of mitochondrial membranes (Table 1). Significant differences between OMM and IMM are the increased levels of

cardiolipin (CL), PtdEtn and phosphatidic acid (PA) at the expense of PtdIns and PtdCho in the latter compartment. In the psd1Δ strain, the level of total cellular and mitochondrial PtdEtn was dramatically reduced as compared to wild-type. This result confirmed that Psd1p is not only the PSD with highest activity in vitro but also the major source of total cellular and mitochondrial PtdEtn in vivo. The decreased formation of PtdEtn in psd1Δ is compensated by an increased amount of PtdCho in all fractions and an increase of PtdIns in total homogenate and especially in the IMM.

The slight decrease of PtdCho in mitochondrial fractions of psd2Δ was paralleled by a slight increase of PtdEtn. In psd2Δ, similar to wild-type, the amount of PtdIns is decreased in the IMM as compared to the OMM, whereas CL is mainly a component of the IMM. In psd1Δ no significant differences in PtdEtn, PtdIns and, most interestingly, in CL levels were observed between the two mitochondrial membranes. In all strains tested, PA was enriched in the IMM.

### 3.2. The majority of mitochondrial PtdEtn is derived from decarboxylation of PtdSer by Psd1p

The relative contribution of PtdSer decarboxylation and CDP-Etn pathways to the formation of mitochondrial PtdEtn was evaluated by subcellular fractionation of wild-type yeast and psd mutants pulse labeled for 30 min with [³H] serine and [¹⁴C] ethanolamine as described in Section 2. In this assay, a high ³H to ¹⁴C ratio is indicative of predominant formation of PtdEtn via the decarboxylation routes, whereas a low ratio points to a larger contribution of the CDP-Etn route. It has to be pointed out again that using this experimental setup absolute values of PtdEtn formation cannot be measured. Comparing labeling patterns in wild-type and different mutant strains, however, allowed dissecting the contribution of pathways to PtdEtn synthesis. Use of

[³H] serine and [¹⁴C] ethanolamine were used as precursors of PtdEtn. Hom: homogenate; Mit: mitochondria; Mic: microsomes; OMM: outer mitochondrial membrane; IMM: inner mitochondrial membrane of wild-type (black bars); psd1Δ (hatched bars) and psd2Δ (dotted bars) were analyzed. The ³H to ¹⁴C ratio is indicative of the contribution of PtdSer decarboxylation and CDP-Etn pathway to PtdEtn formation.

(Table 2). This result confirmed the major role of Psd1p in the formation of total cellular PtdEtn.

In mitochondria of wild-type cells the relative amount of decarboxylation derived PtdEtn is higher than in the homogenate and dramatically increased over the value of microsomes (Fig. 2). This increase can be attributed mainly to Psd1p because of the marked reduction of the \[^3\text{H}]\) to \[^{14}\text{C}]\) ratio in PtdEtn of mitochondria from $psd1\Delta$. This effect is most expressed in the IMM, but less in the OMM. It is noteworthy that the relative contribution of Psd2p and the Kennedy pathway to the supply of PtdEtn to the IMM was only small, whereas both pathways contributed more to the supply of PtdEtn into the OMM (Table 2).

In the $psd1\Delta$ strain, the incorporation of Psd2p and Kennedy pathway derived \[^3\text{H}]\)- and \[^{14}\text{C}]\)-labeled PtdEtn into mitochondria was lower than into lipids of total membranes, although the amount of \[^{14}\text{C}]\)PtdEtn formed through the Kennedy pathway in the homogenate was significantly increased (Table 2). Thus, extramitochondrially formed PtdEtn is rather used outside the mitochondrion than being assembled into mitochondrial membranes. It has also to be noted that the contribution of Psd2p to the formation of the cellular pool of decarboxylation derived PtdEtn in vivo appears to be higher (approximately 30%) than expected from previous data obtained in vitro [15], thus confirming recent results by Storey et al. [23].

In microsomes, PtdEtn derived from the Kennedy pathway is more abundant than in mitochondria. This can be seen from the markedly decreased \[^3\text{H}]\) to \[^{14}\text{C}]\) ratio in microsomal PtdEtn of wild-type and both $psd$ mutants (Fig. 2) and from the amount of \[^{14}\text{C}]\)-labeled PtdEtn incorporated into this fraction (Table 2). This is another example for co-localization of a lipid biosynthetic machinery and the target membrane fraction, because enzymes of the Kennedy pathway were localized in the microsomal fraction [14,42]. When $PSD1$ or $PSD2$ are deleted, the contribution of the Kennedy pathway to total cellular and microsomal PtdEtn formation becomes slightly more pronounced than in wild-type suggesting that in $psd1\Delta$ and $psd2\Delta$ deletion strains the CDP-Etn pathway may be activated.

Deletion of $DPL1$ in wild-type, and $psd1\Delta$ and $psd2\Delta$ mutant background did not significantly affect the contribution of the different pathways to PtdEtn formation and distribution into mitochondrial and microsomal membranes (Fig. 3). This result is in agreement with previous data from our laboratory [6] showing that $psd1\Delta$ $psd2\Delta$ or $cho1\Delta$ mutants are strictly auxotrophic for Etn on nonfermentable carbon sources. Thus, Dpl1p-dependent turnover of sphingoid bases does not significantly contribute to PtdEtn synthesis under these conditions.

### 3.3. Relative contribution of Psd1p, Psd2p and the CDP-choline pathway to formation of mitochondrial PtdCho in vivo

The nearly constant \[^3\text{H}]\) to \[^{14}\text{C}]\) ratio in PtdCho of cell homogenate, mitochondria and microsomes from wild-type labeled with \[^3\text{H}]\)serine and \[^{14}\text{C}]\)choline indicated that there may be only a single pool of PtdCho in yeast cells from which this phospholipid is more or less evenly distributed among cellular membranes (Fig. 4). In $psd1\Delta$, the \[^3\text{H}]\) to \[^{14}\text{C}]\) ratio in PtdCho was decreased in all fractions to about 50% of wild-type level. This result suggested that a significant

Experimental procedure and abbreviations are the same as described in Fig. 2. The mutants $dpl1\Delta$ (black bars), $psd1\Delta$ $dpl1\Delta$ (hatched bars) and $psd2\Delta$ $dpl1\Delta$ (dotted bars) were used in this experiment.

4. Discussion

The central role of Psd1p for cellular and especially for mitochondrial function was pointed out in previous work from our laboratory [6] and by other authors [23]. The supply of PtdEtn to the IMM by Psd1p appears to be the major function of this enzyme, because import of PtdEtn into mitochondria from extramitochondrial sites of synthesis occurs in a rather inefficient way (see Table 2).

A novel role of Psd2p emerged from studies presented here. It is not only the significant contribution of this enzyme to the synthesis of cellular PtdEtn in vivo, but also the important role of Psd2p to produce a PtdEtn pool specifically required for PtdCho synthesis. Deletion of *PSD1* reduced the levels of cellular and mitochondrial PtdEtn dramatically, but the concentration of PtdCho in the homogenate and in mitochondria remained fairly constant (see Table 1). Thus, the Psd2p and the Kennedy pathways are able to form sufficient PtdCho even in the absence of Psd1p. Most notably, the incorporation of \[^3\text{H}]\)serine into PtdEtn was more dramatically affected than incorporation into PtdCho in the *psd1Δ* deletion strain. In contrast, deletion of *PSD2* only moderately reduced the amount of PtdEtn formed through decarboxylation, whereas a major defect became evident for PtdCho synthesis in the *psd2Δ* mutant (see Tables 2 and 3). The limitation of the substrate PtdEtn for the methylation route yielding PtdCho appears to enhance the CDP-Cho pathway in *psd2Δ* slightly as documented by the increased incorporation of \[^{14}\text{C}]\)choline into PtdCho in vivo (see Table 3). This increase is in line with the observation that activities of enzymes of the CDP-Cho pathway are slightly enhanced in this mutant (data not shown), although a similar effect was observed with the *psd1Δ* mutant in which incorporation of \[^{14}\text{C}]\)choline into PtdCho in vivo was not enhanced (see Table 3). On the other hand, both *psd1Δ* and *psd2Δ* exhibited increased incorporation of \[^{14}\text{C}]\)ethanolamine into PtdEtn as compared to wild-type (see Table 2). Nevertheless, activities of enzymes in vitro of the CDP-Etn branch of the Kennedy pathway were rather decreased in both mutants compared to wild type (data not shown). The notion that increased labeling of PtdCho and PtdEtn in *psd* mutants with \[^{14}\text{C}]\)choline or \[^{14}\text{C}]\)ethanolamine, respectively, was due to decreased activity of phospholipase D1, Pld1p, was not

supported by experimental evidence, because activity of this enzyme was the same in cell free extracts of *psd1Δ*, *psd2Δ* and wild-type (data not shown). The enzyme activities observed in vitro do, of course, not necessarily reflect the in vivo situation and the interpretation regarding regulatory aspects should be made with caution.

In contrast to PtdEtn, PtdCho is more or less evenly supplied to mitochondria and microsomes (Table 3). Since OMM and IMM are devoid of PtdCho-synthesizing enzymes, mitochondrial PtdCho must be imported from the extramitochondrial space. Similar to PtdCho, a small but significant amount of PtdEtn is imported into mitochondria. The mechanism which governs this import is still unknown. We can only speculate at present that association of lipid-synthesizing with lipid-receiving membranes may play a role in this process as has been suggested for the import of PtdSer into mitochondria [13,43–45].

In summary, our results presented here demonstrate that the different pathways of PtdEtn and PtdCho biosynthesis affect each other. A defect in one of these pathways seems to enhance the other biosynthetic routes, at least to some extent. The first level of regulation in the metabolic network of aminoglycerophospholipid formation appears to occur at the protein level, either at the stage of translation/transcription or through activation of enzymes. Moreover, subcellular localization of PtdEtn- and PtdCho-synthesizing enzymes predetermines the destination of the respective lipid formed. The best example with this respect is the preferential formation of mitochondrial PtdEtn by Psd1p. Thus, the second level of regulation of PtdEtn and PtdCho distribution within the cell occurs at the level of organelles which harbor the enzymes involved in the different routes of synthesis. The third level of selectivity for PtdEtn and PtdCho homeostasis in subcellular membranes is the transport of intermediates and products between organelles. We still do not know the machinery at the molecular level which controls the import/export of phospholipids between mitochondria and other membranous compartments involved in the biosynthesis of lipids. We know, however, certain features of these transport processes, among them species selectivity as shown by recent work of Heikinheimo and Somerharju [46,47] and Schneiter et al. [48]. Work in our laboratory to address this aspect more specifically in connection to the interaction of PtdEtn biosynthetic pathways showed that species selectivity for PtdEtn to be incorporated into mitochondria occurs mainly at the enzymatic (biosynthetic) level and only to a lesser extent by transport processes [49].
