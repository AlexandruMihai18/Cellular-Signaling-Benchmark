### Abstract

Calcium has evolved as global intracellular messenger for signal transduction in the millisecond time range by reversibly binding to calcium-sensing proteins. In the cardiomyocyte, ion pumps, ion exchangers and channels keep the cytoplasmic calcium level at rest around ~100 nM which is more than 10,000-fold lower than outside the cell. Intracellularly, calcium is mainly stored in the sarcoplasmic reticulum, which comprises the bulk of calcium available for the heartbeat. Regulation of cardiac function including contractility and energy production relies on a three-tiered control system, (i) immediate and fast feedback in response to mechanical load on a beat-to-beat basis (Frank-Starling relation), (ii) more sustained regulation involving transmitters and hormones as primary messengers, and (iii) long-term adaptation by changes in the gene expression profile. Calcium signaling over largely different time scales requires its integration with the protein kinase signaling network which is governed by G-protein-coupled receptors, growth factor and cytokine receptors at the surface membrane. Short-term regulation is dominated by the β-adrenergic system, while long-term regulation with phenotypic remodeling depends on sustained signaling by growth factors, cytokines and calcium. Mechanisms and new developments in intracellular calcium handling and its interrelation with the MAPK signaling pathways are discussed in detail.

target sites of signaling for myocyte function that is, under normal conditions, mainly dominated by adrenergic regulation. The upstream connections to the individual GPCRs appear in Fig. 2. Finally, the integration of the GPCRs signaling cascades with those of the membrane receptor kinases are given in Fig. 3. Intensive cross-connections with feedforward and feedback loops are characteristic for all three levels. Since important and new aspects concerning some of the depicted pathways will be discussed in the text, the diagrams may help for orientation.

We are aware that these types of schematics are tinted with personal bias as compared to cardiomyocyte systems modeling in silico [5,6]. Nevertheless, also computational modeling of the cardiomyocyte relies on data furnished by good biochemistry, and model optimization to fit data parameters should be viewed as a combination of art (or more mundane, personal bias) and science [7]. Additional complexity in signaling arises from the fact that most components come in several isoforms whose expression may be regulated in a developmental- and tissue-specific manner. Furthermore, the encircled components in Fig. 1 mark pivotal branching points that may distribute the stimuli into several different directions. One has to bear in mind, however, that the sequentially reacting components are usually not freely diffusible in the cytoplasm, but are organized in various multiprotein complexes (signalosomes), which assure specific targeting [6,8–11]. Finally,

we intentionally focus on the basic research done on calcium and the general signaling network in cardiac myocytes and, in order to limit the scope of this review, do not venture into possible implications, mainly derived from transgenic animal models, concerning future therapeutic strategies.

3. Revelation of calcium as global signaling component

Ringer was the first to detect in 1883 [12] that Ca²⁺ was required in the perfusate for contraction of the isolated rat heart. At a time when Ca²⁺ was perceived as a structural element providing stability to bones, a dynamic function in cell biochemistry was an unexpected observation [13]. In 1940 Heilbrunn suggested that Ca²⁺ serves as intracellular trigger for muscle contraction [14]. Only in the 1960s was Ca²⁺ identified as activator of the contractile proteins and that the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) regulates intracellular release and reuptake of Ca²⁺ in muscle [15,16]. This research was aided by the then newly available chelator ethyleneglycol-bis(beta-aminoethylether)-N,N′-tetra acetic acid (EGTA). In contrast to EDTA that binds both Mg²⁺ and Ca²⁺ with high affinity, EGTA binds Mg²⁺ (pK₁ = 5.2) with an affinity 6 orders of magnitude lower than Ca²⁺ (pK₁ = 11). Thus EGTA allows to measure Ca²⁺-sensitive biochemical processes without impairing the Mg²⁺ required in the MgATP substrate complex.

Consecutively, the intracellular Ca²⁺ binding protein that relays the Ca²⁺ signal to the contractile apparatus first characterised was from skeletal muscle [17,18] and is now known as troponin-C (TnC). While TnC is specific for cross-striated muscles, the ubiquitous Ca²⁺ sensing protein, calmodulin (CAM), interacts with a variety of intracellular target sites. Its Ca²⁺ binding capacity was recognised only in 1973 [19]. From that time, research on Ca²⁺ as intracellular messenger has continuously expanded. Alone in the last year (2005), 1886 primary research reports and 228 reviews were published with the term “calcium (or Ca²⁺) signaling (or signalling)” in the title or in the abstract. In retrospect, it took almost 100 years until Ca²⁺ was recognised as the global player in intracellular signaling. An overview was published last year [13] mentioning the vast array of Ca²⁺-modulated cellular functions including regulation of many metabolic enzymes, membrane-linked processes (excitation-contraction, -secretion, and -transcription coupling, synaptic transmission), hormonal regulations, control of contractile and motile systems, cell cycle, fertilization, and vision.

### 4. Why was calcium chosen as intracellular messenger?

In rough approximation, the Ca²⁺ concentration is above 10⁻³ M extracellularly and around 1–2 × 10⁻⁷ M in the cytoplasm of cardiomyocytes, thus creating a 10,000-fold gradient between them. Upon stimulation the cytoplasmic Ca²⁺ increases about 20-fold to over 10⁻⁶ M [13,20]. In contrast, the cytoplasmic Mg²⁺ concentration is rather constant around 10⁻³ M, close to that found outside the cell. In the cytoplasm Mg²⁺ is largely buffered by ATP and proteins [21]. The lipid bilayer membranes of the cell surface as well as of the intracellular organelles are virtually impenetrable for the divalent cations. Three main aspects seem decisive for Ca²⁺ being chosen for intracellular signaling [13,20,22–24].

First, cytoplasmic Ca²⁺ in the millimolar range forms insoluble salts with phosphate anions derived from energy metabolism. Mg²⁺-salts are better soluble which is compatible with its high cytoplasmic concentration. Intracellular Mg²⁺ is required for directly activating many enzymes and serves as cofactor in the substrate complex Mg-ATP. Therefore, cells developed mechanisms to clear the cytoplasm from Ca²⁺ by energy consuming ion pumps and electrogenically functioning ion exchangers in order to protect their metabolism. Once the cytoplasmic level was low, Ca²⁺ could be used as signal transducer.

Second, transduction of the Ca²⁺ signal to cellular targets requires a specific receiver system [22–25]. It consists of a number of Ca²⁺-sensing proteins to which the divalent cation can reversibly bind with high affinity. These proteins contain a variable number of metal ion binding sites. Each site

contains around 30 amino acids forming two alpha-helical stretches with the ion binding loop in between (called EF-hand). To date 66 distinct subfamilies with over 600 EF-hand proteins are known many of which function as information transducers or as Ca²⁺ buffers in various cell compartments.

Third, Ca²⁺ readily fits into the binding sites of EF-hand proteins with irregular geometry and variable number of coordinates. In contrast, Mg²⁺ requires for tight binding six coordinates in a regular octahedral arrangement, and may be rejected by sites that optimally bind Ca²⁺ [13,23,24]. Due to the different electron shell configuration, Ca²⁺ is the more reactive metal than Mg²⁺.

The human skeleton comprises over 1 kg calcium of which only 10 g escape to serve vital cell functions. Free Ca²⁺ in the blood (and hence in the extracellular space) is tightly controlled by parathormone and calcitonin at 1 mM (total blood Ca²⁺ is around 2.5 mM half of which is liganded to proteins and organic acids). Ca²⁺ binding proteins in the extracellular space generally display low affinity constants between 10³ and 10⁴ M⁻¹. Nevertheless, many such extracellular proteins, as for example involved in cell-cell contacts or in the blood clotting cascade, require bound Ca²⁺ for functional stability and not for signaling.

### 5. Calmodulin and troponin-C as prototypical calcium sensors

The general intracellular Ca²⁺-sensor is the ubiquitous calmodulin (CAM) with four EF-hands, two in the N-terminal lobe and two in the C-terminal lobe [23,26,27]. The two lobes are separated from one another (dumb-bell shape) by a helical connection flexible enough to accommodate binding to various target proteins. CAM is one of the most conserved proteins among different species. It has a molecular mass of around 17 kDa (148 amino acid residues in vertebrates). The affinity constants of the four binding sites for Ca²⁺ vary around 10⁵ M⁻¹ when CAM is not bound to target proteins. On binding to target proteins the affinities increase significantly. These affinities are in the range that Ca²⁺ can bind during cellular activation (Ca²⁺

bound CAM = CaCAM), while during rest the sites may be empty (apoCAM) or partially occupied by Mg²⁺. Since the affinities of the EF-hands for Mg²⁺ usually are around 10⁴ times lower, this ion will not seriously interfere with the Ca²⁺ signaling, despite its high cytoplasmic concentration. CAM is known to interact with well over 100 different target enzymes or structural proteins. Some Ca²⁺-regulated proteins comprise their own CAM as an intrinsic subunit component like the phosphorylase kinase, the ryanodine-sensitive Ca²⁺ release channel (RYR2), the α1C subunit of the L-type Ca²⁺ channel, and the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) Ca²⁺ release channel (IP3R), or have integrated EF-hands into their primary protein structure like the calcineurin-B subunit, RYR2 of the SR, the calpain proteases, the vertebrate phospholipase isoforms, the myosin essential light chain1 and regulatory light chain2, dystrophin and many more [23,28].

Troponin-C (TnC) displays a similar structure like CAM. Together with the myosin light chains (MLC1 and MLC2), both TnC and CAM belong to the same EF-hand protein subfamily CTER [23]. Cardiac troponin-C (cTnC, ~18 kDa) forms a heterotrimeric complex comprising in addition the inhibitory (cTnI, ~23 kDa) and the tropomyosin binding components (cTnT, ~35 kDa). This troponin complex is stably integrated in the actin filament along the tropomyosin thread at a longitudinal spacing of 38.5 nm at every seven actin monomers, and confers Ca²⁺-sensitivity to the contractile machinery in striated muscles [29–32]. cTnC contains three functional EF-hands (sites II, III and IV). The two EF-hands in the C-terminal lobe (sites III and IV) have such a high binding constant (>10⁷ M⁻¹), that Ca²⁺ remains bound even during rest (K for Mg²⁺ ~10³ M⁻¹). The two bound Ca²⁺ are believed to secure structural integrity of cTnC. One of the two EF-hands in the N-terminal lobe (site II) regulates contractility by reversibly binding Ca²⁺ with an affinity around 10⁶ M⁻¹. The affinity for Mg²⁺ at this regulatory site is low ~10² M⁻¹ thus enabling cTnC to sense the Ca²⁺ fluctuations between resting and activated myocardium even in the presence of millimolar concentrations of Mg²⁺. Due to several amino acid replacements in the coordination points, site-I is no more able to bind Ca²⁺ as it does in TnC of fast skeletal muscles. The cTnC isoform is also expressed in slow skeletal muscle. The two TnC isoforms derive from two separate genes.

Ca²⁺ signaling acts fast, in the range of milliseconds. Upon binding of Ca²⁺ to the regulatory EF-domains, the Ca²⁺-sensing protein undergoes a conformational change that is conferred to those target proteins directly interacting with it. Based on crystal and NMR structures with target peptides, detailed descriptions of the interactions of cTnC with its reaction partners during muscle contraction [25,33] and of CAM with several target proteins [34–37] are available.

6. Integration of calcium signaling in the cardiomyocyte

As mentioned earlier, Ca²⁺ is a highly versatile signaling component involved in the regulation of various cell functions operating at largely different time scales [10]. Regulation of cardiac function, in terms of contractility, beating frequency, blood supply, and metabolic rates, relies on a three-tiered control system: (i) immediate and fast feedback response to the actual mechanical demand on a beat-to-beat basis (Frank-Starling relation), (ii) more sustained regulation of performance executed by the autonomic nervous system involving transmitters and hormones as primary messengers affecting the intracellular signaling system, and (iii) long-term adaptation to altered physiological and pathological conditions brought about by changes in the gene expression program.

Besides the fast Ca²⁺ signal (millisecond range), the second more sustained signaling mode involves covalent protein modification mostly by reversible phosphorylation, which is a much slower process on a time scale of seconds and minutes. This latter requires two sets of enzymes, protein kinases and protein phosphatases. The protein remains activated (or inhibited) as long as it is phosphorylated, until the signal is switched off by dephosphorylation. Smooth muscle provides an example for slow contraction and relaxation. In contrast to heart muscle, smooth muscle lacks troponin for direct fast Ca²⁺ control but is primarily regulated by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of the myosin regulatory light chain2 (MLC2) and other proteins [38]. Nevertheless, Ca²⁺ is still the decisive player in signaling by controlling the activities of several protein kinases and phosphatases. Ca²⁺ thus indirectly modulates most of the signaling cascades. On the other hand, the Ca²⁺-sensitive signaling components in the cascades are able to decode different qualities of Ca²⁺ signals such as cytoplasmic concentration levels as well as frequency and amplitude of Ca²⁺ transients [10].

Signaling originating from membrane receptors of growth factors and cytokines mostly proceed via phosphorylation cascades with one protein kinase after the other being modified in series. This not only allows for signal amplification involving more molecules from step to step, but also for specificity when the downstream signaling components translocate to subcellular structures and associate with signaling platforms near or at their target effectors. The MAPK (mitogen activated protein kinase) pathways prototypically display such signal amplification combined with target-directed specificity. Some of the cross-connections between the MAPK, JAK/STAT (janus kinase/ signaling transducers and activators of transcription), and RSTK/Smad (vertebrate homolog of Drosophila Mad protein) pathways and the GPCR signaling pathways as well as the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) and their intricate relation to the G-protein signaling are summarised in Fig. 3. The literature on the MAPK pathways is enormous and many more interactions than shown in Fig. 3 have been defined. However, description of all these cross-connections is not the topic of this survey, instead some recent reviews may be cited here [2,3,38–44]. The intensive cross-connections among them along the way from the surface membrane receptors down to the MAPK level is reminiscent of those seen among the G-protein signaling pathways leading to the target-specific Ser/Thr kinases (Fig. 2).

The MAPKKK and MAPK levels comprise Ser/Thr kinases, while the dual-specific kinases phosphorylating threonine and tyrosine (in the T-X-Y motif) are at the MAPKK level

conferring specificity to the target-specific MAPKs. Many of the components in the signaling pathways of Fig. 3, might serve as nodal points themselves by being able to relay the signal to several different routes. Spatio-temporal specificity can only be supported by build-up of multiprotein complexes constructed by scaffolding proteins at the sites of action, i.e. at the surface membrane where the receptors are located as well as at the membranes and fibrous structures of intracellular organelles [8,45–47]. Aimless diffusion of signaling molecules would mean a costly enterprise with lack of specificity.

Many target proteins contain multiple phosphorylation sites, some of which may have positive, and others which may have negative effects when phosphorylated. Furthermore, a particular site may accept more than one type of kinases, or different kinases may phosphorylate only their specific sites in a given protein.

Finally, the complex signaling network that integrates the different types of extracellular stimuli as depicted in Fig. 3, is able to entertain a gene expression program that maintains myocyte structure and function within, what may be called, a physiological range of variation. The network seems robust enough to withstand short-lasting perturbations. However, long-lasting mechanical overload, ischemic conditions or late-onset genetic disturbances, unavoidably entail an imbalance among the primary stimuli that affects gene expression, and remodeling of the myocardium sets in. We have previously shown that distinct differences in gross myocyte structure as well as regulation of markers of remodeling can be correlated to individual extracellular stimuli [4,48]. These findings indicate that, despite the many cross-connections among the different signaling pathways, characteristic phenotypes can be attributed to a particular stimulus in excess over the others.

through Gai-coupled proteins to inhibit the adenylyl cyclase (AC).

The signals of relatively few primary messengers get enormously diversified on their way until they reach the level of the target-specific Ser/Thr kinases allowing for multiple cross-talk and feedback loops. However, the canonical signaling by β1-AR follows its route downstream via Gas-AC-producing cAMP and reaches the protein kinase-A (PKA) without branching off (Fig. 2). PKA then serves as nodal signaling point for various targets thus increasing intracellular Ca²⁺, positive inotropy (increased contractile amplitude) and lusitropy (enhanced relaxation) (Fig. 1). This straight pathway may be significant for the general fight-or-flight response concomitant with an increase in heart rate. The other ARs can couple to different types of G-proteins with further downstream branch off points, depending on the physiological or pathophysiological conditions. For instance, the β2-AR primarily couples to Gas, however, phosphorylation of Ser261 and Ser262 in the third intracellular loop and of Ser345 and Ser346 in the C-terminal region by PKA diverts its interaction from the stimulating Gas to the AC inhibitory Gai protein [38,56]. In conjunction with the fast alert reaction, this change in G-protein preference of the β2-AR upon phosphorylation at several sites could control cellular responses in a timely ordered fashion.

GPCRs coupling to Gai-proteins have the main effector pathway via phospholipase-C (PLC), which hydrolyses phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), generating the two second messengers IP3 and diacylglycerol (DAG). IP3 activates the IP3 Ca²⁺ release channel (IP3R) in the SR and endoplasmatic reticulum (ER), while DAG activates several different protein kinase-C (PKC) isoforms (Fig. 1).

Signal termination of ARs is commonly referred to as desensitization. Homologous desensitization involves phosphorylation at the cytoplasmic C-terminal region of the active β1- and β2-ARs by a family of GPCR kinases (GRKs) (for details see Section 7.6). Non-activated or antagonist-bound ARs are usually not phosphorylated by GRKs [52,57,58]. The low amount of β3-ARs (around 1% of total ARs in human myocardium) is lacking these phosphorylation sites and is therefore refractory to desensitization by protein kinases. Heterologous desensitization occurs by phosphorylation in the absence of agonist occupancy and is regulated by signaling of other receptors via an intermediary second messenger such as cAMP (activating PKA) or IP3 and DAG (activating PKC). A brief note on some nodal signaling components follows below (Figs. 1 and 2). More functional aspects will appear in the appropriate sections, and other components including CAM-dependent protein kinase-II (CaMKII) and phosphatases will be mentioned in the Section 8 on “Clearing calcium from the cytoplasm”.

### 7. Adrenergic signaling pathways

Systolic and diastolic function as well as heart rate are primarily controlled by the adrenergic and the muscarinic system in response to the varying physiological demands [38,49,50]. The Ca²⁺ signal is primarily modulated by adrenergic control of phosphorylation of almost all proteins (ion channels, pumps and ion exchangers) involved in intracellular Ca²⁺ handling (Fig. 1). The adrenergic receptors (ARs) with their nine subtypes (α1A, α1B, α1D, α2A, α2B, α2C, β1, β2 and β3) belong to the family of GPCRs [51,52]. The heterotrimeric G-protein complex (Gaβγ) binds to their cytoplasmic side. In the inactive complex GDP is bound to Ga and the Gβγ dimer prevents its release. Activation by an extracellular agonist causes the exchange of GDP for GTP, whereupon Ga dissociates from the Gβγ dimer and both Ga-GTP as well as Gβγ can interact with downstream effectors [53–55]. At least 23 different α-subunits have been identified and classified into four families (Gas, Gai/o, Gaq/11, and Ga12) in addition to seven β- and 12 γ-subunits. This allows for hundreds of combinatorial heterotrimers to be formed. A number of known interrelations between G-protein signaling pathways downstream of ARs and some additional receptor systems important in the heart are summarised in Fig. 2. The muscarinic M2 receptors oppose the βAR activation by acting

#### 7.1. Adenylyl cyclase

AC is an integral membrane protein with 12 putative transmembrane helices (~140 kDa) and comprises at least nine isoforms (AC1–AC9) [59–61]. AC5 is predominantly expressed in cardiomyocytes, whereas AC6 occurs in heart cells other than myocytes. The 12 transmembrane helices are

separated into two groups of six with a large cytoplasmic loop in between. Together with the large cytoplasmic C-terminal portion, this loop forms the catalytic site. The short N-terminus is also inside the cell. In addition to its regulation by Gαs and Gαi, phosphorylation by PKCα enhances and PKA attenuates the AC5 activity. Furthermore, high cytoplasmic Ca²⁺ during sustained cell activity inhibits AC5 and AC6, establishing a negative feedback loop. The fine-tuning in regulating the AC is of particular significance since its activity is considered to be rate-limiting in adrenergic signal transmission [62]. The production of cAMP is counter-balanced by its hydrolysis to 5′-AMP by cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (PDE).

### 7.2. Phosphodiesterase

PDEs constitute a large multigenic family (11 families) that include at least 20 genes and ~50 unique isoforms [59,63–65]. Four groups of isoforms comprising ~20 splice variants are mainly found in the heart and have been characterised: PDE1 which is activated by CaCAM; PDE2 which is stimulated by cGMP; PDE3 which is cAMP-selective and inhibited by cGMP; PDE4 which is cAMP-specific. While PDE3 and PDE4 hydrolyse cAMP, PDE1 hydrolyses equally cAMP and cGMP, and PDE2 hydrolyses both with a lower apparent Km (Michaelis-Menten constant) for cGMP than for cAMP. Members of the PDE1 (61–81 kDa) and PDE2 (~106 kDa) occur in the cytoplasm as homodimers, while those of PDE3 (~125 kDa) and PDE4 (~98 kDa) may bind to membranes and protein complexes (see Section 9.2 on RYR2 Ca²⁺ release channel). The relative amounts of these isoforms may vary in response to physiological and pathological conditions. Together with the AC isoforms the PDE system provides a powerful negative feedback control over the adrenergic modulation of contractility (Fig. 1). The fact that PDE activity reduces the inotropic response by degradation of cAMP prompted the development of PDE inhibitors for the treatment of acute systolic failure. Moreover, the close circuit between AC and the membrane-associated PDE isoforms enables spatially restricted compartmentation of the cAMP signal thus shielding other parts of the cell from activation [59,66].

### 7.3. Phospholipase-C

A number of PLC isoforms are divided into four main families as β and γ (120–155 kDa), δ (~85 kDa), and ε (230–260 kDa). Despite variation in amino acid sequence and size, they all contain two relatively conserved regions (X and Y with ~60% sequence similarity) that together form the catalytic site [10,67,68]. All PLCs require one Ca²⁺ ion bound to the active site that is involved in the binding of the substrate PIP2. The smaller isoforms β, γ and δ furthermore contain an EF-hand motif that is also thought to bind Ca²⁺. Whether the Ca²⁺ in the EF-hand (which is not present in the ε-isoform) has a modulatory function is not known. Additional domains like PH (pleckstrin homology domain) and C2 (Ca²⁺-sensor domain) are present in most isoforms and are involved in the association with membrane proteins and polyphosphoinositides. In the heart the PLC isoforms are differently regulated. PLCβ1 and PLCβ2 are stimulated by Gαq (Fig. 2), while PLCδ and PLCε may interact with activated growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) where they can be phosphorylated at several tyrosine residues (Fig. 3). Specific roles for the PLC isoforms in cardiac function are not well documented so far, except for a recent report on PLCε [67]. PLCε was shown to increase contractile reserve as a component of βAR signaling although the exact connection is not known. PLCε is thought to be upregulated during sustained stress as a compensatory response to βAR downregulation during heart failure.

### 7.4. Protein kinase-A

The major Ser/Thr protein kinases considered here and in further subsections include PKA, PKC, GRK and CaMKII. However, there are also many tyrosine-specific kinases such as RTKs, non-receptor tyrosine kinases (NRTKs) and others importantly involved in intracellular signaling (Fig. 3).

In the absence of cAMP, PKA is an enzymatically inactive tetrameric holoenzyme consisting of two catalytic subunits (PKAC monomer ~40 kDa) bound to a regulatory subunit dimer (PKAR monomer ~42 kDa) [69–71]. Usually the PKAC subunits are constitutively autophosphorylated and ready to respond to cAMP activation. cAMP cooperatively binds to the two sites on each PKAR subunit. Upon binding of four cAMP molecules, the holoenzyme dissociates leaving a PKAR dimer still with four bound cAMP, and two independent active PKAC subunits. Two classes of mammalian PKAs with either PKAR-I or PKAR-II type subunits have been described. However, a great heterogeneity of both PKAR and PKAC subunits allows for a multitude of tetrameric isoforms. The isoforms may differ in enzyme properties and subcellular localisation, the latter appearing to be regulated by different so-called A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs). At least 10 different AKAPs, including ezrin, mAKAP (previously called AKAP100), AKAP15/18, AKAP79, AKAP250 (also called gravin), are expressed in cardiomyocytes displaying specific subcellular localisation such as the surface membrane, SR, mitochondria, nuclear envelope, and cytoskeleton [45–47,72,73]. The type-II PKAR subunits may be tethered to differently localised AKAPs, whereas PKAC combined with type-I PKAR subunits remain in the cytoplasm. The affinity for binding the PKAR-II subunits may vary among the different AKAPs and is further modified by phosphorylation of the PKAR-II subunits themselves. AKAPs participate in multiprotein signaling complexes that may include PKAs, PKCs, Tyr-kinases, phosphatases, PDEs, ion channels, GPCRs, CAM and PIP2.

### 7.5. Protein kinase-C

PKC isoforms have in common a conserved kinase core whose activity is allosterically regulated by a regulatory domain located upstream, a C1 domain (binding DAG) and in some cases an additional C2 domain (Ca²⁺-sensor) [69,74,75]. The 10 mammalian PKC isoforms are grouped into three classes:

four conventional isoforms (α, β1, β2, γ, ~74 kDa) with functional C1 and C2 domains requiring DAG and Ca²⁺ for activation, (ii) four novel isoforms (δ, ε, η/L, θ, ~82 kDa) with a functional C1 and a non-functional C2 domain requiring only DAG for activation, and (iii) two atypical isoforms (ζ and λ, ~68 kDa) with a non-functional C1 domain and lacking the C2 domain responding neither to DAG nor to Ca²⁺. The enzymes seem to be constitutively autophosphorylated except for the atypical PKCs. The cells maintain a pool of processed PKCs responsive to activation by the second messengers.

For activation all PKC isoforms translocate to membrane structures which provides a mechanism to regulate substrate access. Since individual isoforms display only limited substrate-specificity in vitro, distinct substrate-specificity in vivo depends on isoform-selective interactions with membrane-associated anchoring proteins, termed RACKs (receptors for activated C-kinases). PKCs mark another nodal point with connections to multiple targets sometimes sharing the same phosphorylation sites with PKA or CaMKII (Fig. 1).

### 7.6. G-protein coupled receptor kinase

GRKs cooperate in the assembly of macromolecular complexes at the surface membrane in the receptor environment. Like most proteins, also GRKs come in isoforms. Seven mammalian isoforms are known so far [76,77]. GRK2, GRK3 and GRK5 are expressed in healthy human heart. The C-terminal domain of GRK5 binds phospholipids, accounting for its preferential membrane association, while GRK2 and GRK3 are mainly found in the cytoplasm from where they may be recruited to the membrane by association with arrestins and Gβγ-subunits. GRK2 (~80 kDa) and GRK5 (~68 kDa) are important for the cardiac ARs, while GRK3 also interacts with other GPCR systems. Ca²⁺ seems to differentially regulate the GRKs. CAM when saturated with Ca²⁺ binds with high affinity to GRK5 and blocks its membrane targeting thus directing its activity towards soluble substrates. In contrast, GRK2 has a low affinity for CaCAM. On the other hand, association of GRKs with α-actinin or caveolin attenuates their kinase activity. Furthermore, both PKA and PKC can phosphorylate GRKs leading to higher activity of GRK2 and strong inhibition of GRK5.

GRK2 and GRK5 were shown to be increased in animal models with cardiac dysfunction and in the left ventricle of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and volume overload [76,78]. Upregulation of GRK2 seems to be the main factor involved in diminishing βAR signaling and may be regarded as an initial compensatory mechanism in response to sustained increase of β1-AR stimulation in severe heart dysfunction. Taken together, the GRKs play a pivotal role in adrenergic signaling but their manyfold interconnections in the global signaling network requires further characterisation.

### 8. Clearing calcium from the cytoplasm

Although Ca²⁺ is vital for the regulation of cell function, it is at the same time the most toxic compound surrounding all living cells at deadly concentrations. Cells must keep Ca²⁺ below the toxic level in the cytoplasm. Moreover, Ca²⁺ can only function as intracellular messenger against its low cytoplasmic background, so the mechanisms involved in removal of Ca²⁺ from the cytoplasm will be discussed first.

In cardiomyocytes the transiently increased Ca²⁺ signal for contraction is subsequently removed from the cytoplasm mainly via two routes, (i) uptake by the high affinity Ca²⁺ pump SERCA2a into the SR, and (ii) extrusion from the cell via the low affinity and high capacity Na⁺/Ca²⁺-exchanger (NCX1) [10,13,79,80]. SERCA2a and NCX1 are the cardiac-specific isoforms. SERCA2a transports two Ca²⁺ ions per hydrolysis of one ATP, while NCX1 exports one Ca²⁺ against the large concentration gradient of high extracellular Ca²⁺ in exchange for three Na⁺. The ionic exchange is electrochemically driven by the Na⁺ gradient (~150 outside versus ~10 mM inside) established by the Na⁺/K⁺ pump (NKA) taking up two K⁺ in exchange of three Na⁺. The contribution of the sarcolemmal Ca²⁺ pump (PMCA) in removing Ca²⁺ from the cell seems negligible (see Section 8.7). In the heart, about 20–30% of the total metabolic energy is consumed by the pumps in order to maintain those transmembrane ion gradients, a value that may increase up to 50% in failing hearts [81,82].

#### 8.1. Na⁺/Ca²⁺ exchanger

The NCX1 extrudes the activatory Ca²⁺ during relaxation and diastole to varying extents depending on species (~30% in rabbit and human, versus <10% in rat and mouse myocardium), while the remainder is taken up into the SR by the SERCA2a pump [9,83,84]. The NXC1 consists of 970 amino acids (~110 kDa), nine putative transmembrane segments and one large intracellular loop between the segments five and six [83,85]. This loop comprises a region where Ca²⁺ binds with high affinity. Without bound Ca²⁺ the NCX1 is inactive. A similar inactive state appears on increased intracellular Na⁺. Modulation of NCX1 activity by intracellular Ca²⁺ and Na⁺ is complex and further affected by additional regulatory factors such as MgATP or CAM whose mechanisms are not well understood at present. NCX1 itself can be phosphorylated by several protein kinases or, alternatively, an additional small molecular weight regulatory protein may be involved. NCX1 is reportedly stimulated (albeit moderately by ~40%) by PKC activators including phorbol esters, however, no major effect was found after stimulation of PKA with isoproterenol [85,86]. Thus NCX1 does not seem to be under strong sympathetic control by either Ca²⁺ or PKA, but rather seems to steadily contribute to the basal need for removing Ca²⁺ from the cytoplasm.

In addition, the NCX1 activity is strongly voltage-dependent and during depolarisation by the action potential it may shortly operate in the reverse mode letting Ca²⁺ in from outside [79,83,87]. The physiological significance of the Ca²⁺ influx via the NCX1 is still controversial. However, the reduced Ca²⁺ efflux via the NCX1 due to competition with elevated intracellular Na⁺ causes the inotropic effect of cardiac glycosides that inhibit the NKA. On the other hand, net Ca²⁺ entry via the NCX1 can contribute to generating arrhythmia and may be responsible for the glycoside toxicity. NCX1 was reported to be increased in the failing heart

concomitant with a downregulation of SERCA2a, which together leads to a reduced Ca²⁺ content in the SR and may explain systolic dysfunction [87,88]. On the other hand, it was recently shown that in hypertrophic rat cardiomyocytes the catalytic calcineurin-A subunit binds to the intracellular loop of NCX1 and inhibits its exchange function [89]. Thus NCX1 serving as target for calcineurin may contribute to in vivo cardiac hypertrophy by increasing cytoplasmic Ca²⁺.

### 8.2. SR Ca²⁺ pump

SERCA2a pumps Ca²⁺ against a concentration gradient from the cytoplasm into the SR where the free Ca²⁺ level is ~1 mM [9,90–93]. Two splice variants derive from the ATP2A2 gene. SERCA2b is found in the ER of most cell types and is considered to be the housekeeping isoform, while SERCA2a is expressed in heart and slow skeletal muscles. It contains ~1000 amino acids (110 kDa) and, in analogy to the crystal structure of SERCA1, 10 transmembrane helices. The large cytoplasmic head portion bears the A-domain functioning as the “actuator” of the gating mechanism that regulates Ca²⁺ binding and release and the N-domain with the adenosine binding site, while the gamma-phosphate of ATP reacts with Asp351 in the P-domain. The three cytoplasmic domains are folded widely apart when two Ca²⁺ are bound, but gather to form a compact head portion during all other stages of the transport cycle. Regulation from the cytoplasmic side is effected by Ca²⁺ binding sites involving four of the 10 transmembrane segments. In addition, CaMKII can increase the ATP hydrolysis rate by phosphorylation of Ser38 [90,91,94]. Interestingly, this Ser38 is not present in SERCA1 of fast skeletal muscle SR.

In contrast to the NCX1, the regulation of SERCA2a is under strong sympathetic control. β1-AR stimulation enables the SERCA2a not only to transport larger amounts of cytoplasmic Ca²⁺ into the SR but also to do so at a faster rate in order to enhance relaxation; both effects are required for coping with the consequences of a faster heart rate. SERCA2a activity is mainly regulated by phospholamban (PLN) and sarcolipin (SLN) through direct protein-protein interactions.

### 8.3. Phospholamban and sarcolipin

PLN is a 52 amino acid (~6 kDa) protein with an N-terminal cytoplasmic portion and a C-terminal transmembrane helix [9,95]. Both parts interact with the SERCA2a and thus inhibit the pump by lowering its affinity to Ca²⁺. Phosphorylation of PLN on either Ser16 by PKA or Thr17 by CaMKII relieves the inhibition by increasing the pump’s affinity for Ca²⁺ binding. Upon phosphorylation of PLN at Ser16 and/or Thr17 the pump is activated [96,97]. In elegant experiments it has been shown that phosphorylation at Thr17 by CaMKII is frequency-dependent and can occur independently of Ser16 phosphorylation by PKA. However, phosphorylation by CaMKII in addition to PKA, has a much greater effect than the separate responses to the two stimuli, either β1-AR stimulation or frequency increase. The frequency-dependence of CaMKII activity may be attributed to its intrinsic “memory” ability (see Section 8.4 on

CaMKII) [11,98,99]. When the pump binds Ca²⁺ the phosphorylated PLN may dissociate. Dissociated PLN as well as PLN in excess of SERCA2a forms pentamers of ~30 kDa with a channel-like structure [100]. If and how the distribution between pentameric PLN and its stoichiometric association with SERCA2a depends on phosphorylation is not yet clear. PLN can also be phosphorylated at Ser10 by PKC for which a functional significance is not known.

The PLN regulation is further complicated by its homolog SLN, a protein with 31 amino acids (~3.5 kDa) that looks like a truncated PLN [9,95,101]. SLN comprises only the transmembrane segment. Despite lacking the cytoplasmic domain with the two phosphorylation sites, it still interacts with SERCA2a and inhibits the pump by lowering its affinity for Ca²⁺. In coexpression experiments of SLN together with PLN and SERCA2a, superinhibition of the pump was observed. SLN has a high affinity to PLN and may disrupt the pentameric assemblies thus increasing the availability of monomeric PLN. SLN and PLN appear to bind to the same regulatory site of SERCA2a. In the ternary complex, however, PLN occupies the regulatory site and SLN binds to the exposed side of PLN and to SERCA2a as well. SLN is highly expressed in fast-twitch skeletal muscles, but only at low levels in cardiac and in slow-twitch skeletal muscles. SLN is more abundant in rat than in mouse and human ventricular myocytes. Although PLN is assumed to be in excess over SERCA2a, the physiological significance of SLN in setting the balance between them is not obvious. Furthermore, the relative proportions of the three components may unpredictably change under pathological conditions. PLN is dephosphorylated by a protein phosphatase type-PP1 (Section 8.6) that resides in the vicinity in a complex with a PKA anchoring protein (possibly mAKAP) and a transmembrane scaffolding protein thus ensuring ready access to the substrate [9,72,91].

### 8.4. Calmodulin-dependent protein kinase-II

CaMKII occupies another nodal branching point in the signaling network affecting, besides PLN, a variety of Ca²⁺ handling proteins (Fig. 1). Sustained CaMKII activity has been linked to arrhythmias and cardiomyopathies under conditions where cytoplasmic Ca²⁺ is elevated. CaMKII is a multimeric Ser/Thr kinase. The holoenzyme consists of 6–12 monomers each with a molecular mass of ~55 kDa (adding up to 330–660 kDa) comprising a catalytic, an autoinhibitory and an association domain [27,98,102,103]. Four different genes give rise to four isoforms with CaMKIIδ being predominantly expressed in the heart. However, several splice variants of CaMKIIδ were found. CaMKIIδc is the cytoplasmic form affecting PLN, SERCA2a, the L-type Ca²⁺ channels (DHPR), and RYR2. On the other hand, the primarily nuclear species CaMKIIδB upregulates the expression of characteristic hypertrophic markers such as ANP [104], BNP [105], β-myosin heavy chain [106] and skeletal muscle α-actin [107].

When cytoplasmic Ca²⁺ increases CaCAM binds to CaMKII lifting the autoinhibition and the enzyme gets autophosphorylated at Thr286. Phosphorylation of Thr286 increases the affinity of CaMKII to CaCAM about 1000 fold to K ~10¹⁰ M⁻¹ (CAM

trapping). Subsequent autophosphorylation of the two adjacent Thr305 and Thr306 in the CAM binding region dissociates CAM and prevents it from reassociation (CAM capping). When phosphorylated, the enzyme remains active even after the cytoplasmic Ca²⁺ has returned to basal levels. Thus the multimeric enzyme complex may sample oscillatory Ca²⁺ transients by increasing the number of phosphorylated monomers (see also Section 9.1 on L-type Ca²⁺ channel). Whether CaMKII is activated in a beat-to-beat manner is not known. Its activity is reduced as dephosphorylation proceeds involving several phosphatases such as PP1, PP2A, PP2C and a new protein phosphatase specific for the multifunctional CaMKKIs [108]. Half maximal activation of CaMKII requires ~1 μM free Ca²⁺ which may be attained during contraction cycles [27,98,103]. The initial affinity of CaCAM to CaMKII (K ~10⁷ M⁻¹) is considerably lower than that for other proteins like calcineurin, myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) or phosphodiesterase. The major portion of CaCAM seems to be bound to proteins leaving only a small fraction of free CaCAM (~45 nM) in the cytoplasm. Thus there may be competition for CaCAM between different targets making the limited availability of free CaCAM an additional control factor.

### 8.5. Phosphorylation of calmodulin

As would be expected for a protein of such general importance in relating multiple regulatory processes, CAM (148 amino acids) is susceptible to various post-translational modifications of which the functional significance is not well understood. In addition to acetylation at the N-terminal alanine, trimethylation of Lys115 is catalysed by a lysine N-methyltransferase and several residues can be carboxymethylated by a carboxymethyltransferase using S-adenosyl-L-methionine as donor of the methyl groups. Another interesting post-translational modification of CAM is the proteolytic cleavage of the C-terminal lysine residue by a carboxypeptidase. It has been suggested that a fraction of CAM is constitutively phosphorylated in vivo [109,110]. In vitro, CAM can be phosphorylated by casein kinase-II (CKII) at Thr79, Ser81, Ser101 and less frequently at Thr117, as well as by MLCK at Thr26 and also less frequently at Thr29. In addition, several other kinases including RTKs and TKs were shown to phosphorylate CAM at Tyr99 and Tyr138. CAM phosphorylated by CKII in vitro has a lower affinity towards binding peptides derived from smooth muscle MLCK and PDE1, and a higher affinity towards a CaMKII binding peptide. Little effect was seen with target peptides either from PMCA or calcineurin. Two of the four CKII phosphorylation sites (Thr79 and Ser81) are located in the flexible helix connecting the N- with the C-terminal lobe and may thus influence its plasticity on binding to the target. CaMKII is believed to phosphorylate CAM in vivo but its regulation and functional significance is not yet known. The phosphatases PPIγ and PP2A (but not calcineurin) dephosphorylate CKII phosphorylated CAM, albeit with low efficiency. It is noteworthy that CAM is not phosphorylated by other Ser/Thr kinases such as PKA, PKC and casein kinase-I, which indicates that CAM is not under direct control by the autonomic nervous system.

### 8.6. Protein phosphatases

Equally important as phosphorylation, is the dephosphorylation in order to terminate the sympathetic stimulation. However, less is known about the phosphatases. The major Ser/Thr phosphatases constitute a protein family with considerable homology [111]. They are classified in two groups, PP1 (under control of the heat- and acid-stable inhibitor-1, INH1, and inhibitor-2, INH2), and PP2 (independent of inhibitors). Type-2 phosphatases are further subdivided into PP2A (constitutively active), PP2B (Ca²⁺-dependent calcineurin) and PP2C (Mg²⁺-dependent). Calcineurin and its signaling capacity in regulation of the gene expression program will be dealt with in the Section 13 on “Long-term calcium signaling and cardiac remodeling”.

Generally, the protein kinases are more specific than the phosphatases. This is reflected in the mammalian genome (mouse) where 561 protein kinase genes versus only 162 for phosphatases were identified [112]. Phosphatases usually contain regulatory or so-called targeting subunits that are able to interact directly with the target protein that is to be dephosphorylated or with auxiliary proteins in the vicinity of the target site. Phosphorylation of the targeting subunit then may inhibit the phosphatase as demonstrated for the myosin light chain phosphatase PPICδ [113]. As mentioned before, PKA and CaMKII are able to phosphorylate a number of Ca²⁺ signal regulators, including NCX1, SERCA2a, PLN, and RYR2, at sites accepting both kinases or at sites specific for one of the two kinases. Some of these proteins may be dephosphorylated by PP1 such as SERCA2a [94], PLN [114,115], RYR2 [11,116], and also CaMKII [99,117].

With regard to reversible phosphorylation of PLN in the control of SERCA2a, a complex play between different kinases, phosphatases and phosphatase inhibitors has become apparent which, in addition, is governed by Ca²⁺ at different stages [114,115,118]. PP1C that dephosphorylates PLN is under double control, (i) by its regulatory subunit PP1Gₘ that targets the enzyme to the SR, and (ii) by the inhibitors INH1 and INH2. PP1Gₘ and INH1 both can be phosphorylated at least at two sites with differential effects. Phosphorylation of PP1Gₘ at Ser48 increases PP1C activity, while Ser67 phosphorylation induces dissociation of the two subunits leaving the PP1c less active towards PLN. Both sites can be phosphorylated by PKA, while SR-associated CaMKII may phosphorylate only Ser67 in a Ca²⁺-dependent manner. Dephosphorylation of both sites on PP1Gₘ occurs by either PP2A or the Ca²⁺-dependent calcineurin (PP2B). The accessory regulation by INH1 is also subject to differential phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of Thr35 by PKA enhances the inhibition of PP1C by INH1, while phosphorylation at Ser67 by the Ca²⁺- and DAG-dependent PKCα attenuates the inhibitory action of INH1 thus allowing higher PP1C activity. Dephosphorylation of INH1 is executed by either PP2A or PP2B like for PP1Gₘ.

This represents a delicately regulated control on the target sites where β-adrenergic signaling meets with other pathways. Pure β-adrenergic stimulation via Gαs → AC → cAMP → PKA (Fig. 2) would primarily amplify its own signal in a
concerted way, (i) by dissociation of the PP1G<sub>M</sub> (PKA phosphorylation of Ser67) from the PP1C subunit thus attenuating its phosphatase activity, which probably overrides the potential stimulatory effect by phosphorylation at Ser48, and (ii) by concomitant phosphorylation at the PKA-specific Thr35 of INH1 thus enhancing its inhibitory effect. Both lower the phosphatase activity thus stabilising phosphorylation of PLN which, in turn, when phosphorylated refrains from binding to SERCA2a allowing it to pump at full speed. On the other hand, signaling via Gαi (from M2 receptor) and Gαq (from α1-AR, angiotensin-II or endothelin receptors) proceeds via PLC → DAG and IP3 → Ca<sup>2+</sup> → PKCα (Fig. 2), which may counteract β-adrenergic activity by attenuating PP1C inhibition through phosphorylation at Ser67 of the INH1. Consequently, the PP1C is more active in dephosphorylating PLN which then binds to SERCA2a and inhibits Ca<sup>2+</sup> pumping into the SR. In this pathway PKCα functions as a negative control of contractility. The PP1C inhibitor INH1 thus presents a pivotal point in signaling where the PKCα and PKA pathways meet. Which of the two signaling pathways may dominate, enforced inotropy or attenuated contractile function, depends on the actual physiological and pathological conditions.

### 8.7. Plasma membrane Ca<sup>2+</sup> pump

The Ca<sup>2+</sup> pumps of the plasma membrane (PMCAs, ~140 kDa) contain 10 transmembrane segments with both N- and C-termini located in the cytoplasm. They have high Ca<sup>2+</sup> affinity but limited transport capacity. Together with the SERCA2a and NKA they also belong to the family of P-type ATPases characterised by the formation of an aspartyl-phosphate intermediate [119,120]. In contrast to SERCA2a (transporting two Ca<sup>2+</sup> per ATP) the PMCAs transport only one Ca<sup>2+</sup> per ATP. In the resting state the CAM binding domain in the C-terminal region inhibits the pump activity. Binding of CaCAM removes the autoinhibition. However, a significant contribution of PMCA in removal of the excitatory Ca<sup>2+</sup> (1% at most) could not be demonstrated under physiological conditions.

Four genes give rise to four groups of isoforms (PMCA1-PMCA4) with over 20 splice variants, several of which are expressed in the heart. Although the rationale for so many PMCA variants remains unknown, one can imagine that different functional properties are required to accommodate specific demands in different cell types including localisation to specific cellular subdomains. One of the cardiac isoforms, PMCA4b, was recently shown to associate with neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) in membrane caveolae and to serve Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling functions rather than Ca<sup>2+</sup> extrusion [121,122]. PMCA activity regulates the activity of nNOS, whose activity, in turn, requires CaCAM. It has recently become clear that myocardial NO production, regulated by nNOS, can modulate cardiac contractility.

### 8.8. Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> pump

The NKA pump consists of the α-subunit (~110 kDa) with the catalytic domain facing the cytoplasm and the cardiac glycoside binding domain facing outside, in combination with the β-subunit (~50 kDa) for structural integrity [123,124]. The heterodimer constitutes the functional NKA. It is the only known receptor for the glycosides and thus is of importance as target connected to the disturbed intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling during heart failure and cardiac arrhythmias. Interestingly, this functional binary complex is regulated by an additional γ-component of 66 amino acids. In the heart, phospholemman (PLM) a protein with 72 amino acids that shares sequence similarities with the γ-component as well as with PLN and SLN, takes over this regulation. PLM can be phosphorylated by PKA and PKC. Unphosphorylated PLM inhibits NKA by lowering its affinity for cytoplasmic Na<sup>+</sup>, and phosphorylation by PKA at Ser68 relieves the inhibition. This mode of regulation is reminiscent of PLN and SERCA2a, and is important in the context of sympathetic activation. The larger Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx due to more frequent and larger Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents must be balanced by enhanced Ca<sup>2+</sup> extrusion via the NCX1 that is driven by larger Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients. This increases Na<sup>+</sup> influx at each heartbeat, and the high frequency adds to the Na<sup>+</sup> overload. To limit the rise of intracellular Na<sup>+</sup>, the greater Na<sup>+</sup> influx must be compensated for by an enhanced Na<sup>+</sup> extrusion via the NKA.

### 9. Calcium entry into the cytoplasm during the action potential

For signaling, Ca<sup>2+</sup> must be let into the cytoplasm down its electrochemical gradient in a highly controlled way either from outside the cell or from intracellular stores. In order to keep a steady-state as much Ca<sup>2+</sup> must enter the myocyte from outside as is extruded mainly by the NCX1 after each heartbeat. Otherwise, there would be a progressive loss or gain of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Replacement of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from outside is provided via the L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels that open during each action potential (duration ~250 msec). The channels are also called dihydropyridine receptors (DHPRs) since they serve as target for these widely used Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel blocking drugs [10,79,80,84]. From intracellular stores Ca<sup>2+</sup> reaches the cytoplasm via two types of release channels: (i) the RYR2 channel in the SR, and (ii) the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-gated channel (IP3R2) primarily in the ER membrane and less in the SR. The majority of the DHPRs are located in the T-tubular system closely opposed to the membrane of the terminal cisternae of the SR in the so-called junctional cleft or “dyad”. The facing SR membrane contains the RYR2. While Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx via the DHPRs increases the intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> by a relatively small amount, this signal is amplified by a much larger release of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the SR via the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-gated RYR2s, a process known as Ca<sup>2+</sup> induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> release (CICR). It was estimated that in rabbit cardiomyocytes the activatory Ca<sup>2+</sup> from outside contributes ~23% versus ~77% from the SR, whereas for rat this relation shifts even more in favor of the SR that contributes ~92% and only 8% enter the cell from outside [125].

In the dyads the DHPRs are outnumbered 5–10 times more by RYR2s in the opposite membrane [79,80,84]. However, the close apposition of the two membranes creates a local environment where the diffusible Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal from a few DHPRs may reach a much larger number of RYR2s. This
constitutes the mechanistic basis for the observed amplification effect of the CICR. Spontaneous local DHPR openings at rest may occasionally induce a Ca²⁺ release from a dozen or so RYR2s in one junction appearing as sparks. However, during excitation-contraction coupling, several thousands of sparks in each cell are synchronized in time by the action potential. In this situation the sparks will overlap in space and time, which leads to a Ca²⁺ transient sweeping through the cell. Resting Ca²⁺ sparks are usually rare and isolated. But when cytoplasmic and SR Ca²⁺ load rise, more abundant sparks may coalesce producing Ca²⁺ waves and oscillations. Whether Ca²⁺ influx through the NCX1 can contribute to the induction of CICR, or may even elicit CICR in the absence of DHPR opening, remains difficult to resolve experimentally [13, 126, 127]. Computational simulations indicate that under normal physiological conditions with 10 mM intracellular Na⁺, the NCX1 in reverse mode does not contribute to CICR, despite its presence in the T-tubules nearby. At higher heart rates, however, sufficient amounts of Na⁺ and Ca²⁺ may accumulate in the dyadic subspace to increase the triggering efficiency and even for eliciting CICR.

### 9.1. L-type Ca²⁺ channel (DHPR)

The DHPRs are high voltage-gated channels and open above –40 mV being active mainly during the depolarised plateau phase of the action potential (AP). Among other Ca²⁺ channel types the low voltage T-type channel opens above –70 mV but contributes little to Ca²⁺ entry into ventricular myocytes. T-channels are distributed over the entire sarcolemma (not concentrated in the junctional regions) and are primarily found in Purkinje and in atrial cells involved in controlling rhythmic activity [84, 98, 128]. For reference, the resting membrane potential stays between –80 and –90 mV.

The DHPR is composed of four subunits in a 1:1 stoichiometry (α1, α2, β, δ). Several isoforms of all subunits allow for different channel combinations with cell-specific significance. The cardiac α1C (Cav1.2) subunit (~250 kDa) contains four domains with six transmembrane segments each (S1–S6), which add up to a total of 24 transmembrane segments per molecule. The four S6 segments together form the Ca²⁺ pore while the four S4 segments with their positively charged Arg and Lys residues constitute the voltage sensor of the channel [35, 36, 129]. The cardiac β2 subunit (~74 kDa) is important for trafficking the channel complex to the cell membrane and it can modify its gating properties. The α2 and δ subunits originate from a precursor protein of one gene by proteolytic cleavage; however, the two proteins remain linked via a disulfide bridge. The δ subunit is a small transmembrane protein with the heavily glycosylated α2 protruding outside of the cell. This heterodimer is also implicated in modifying the gating as well as in the expression level of the entire channel complex. Functionally relevant phosphorylation sites for PKC are near the N-terminus (Thr27 and Thr31) of the α1C channel protein, while those for PKA concern Ser1928 in the C-terminal portion of α1C and the two adjacent Ser478 and Ser479 of the β2 subunit. Both N- and C-termini of α1C are located intracellularly. The β2 subunit interacts with the intracellular loop of α1C between S1

and S2. PKA phosphorylation increases the open probability of the channel.

Besides many other factors, the DHPR activity is also regulated by Ca²⁺ itself via binding to CAM. CAM seems to be constitutively attached—whether it has Ca²⁺ bound (CaCAM) or not (apoCAM)—to an IQ motif in the C-terminal portion located close to the pore of the α1C subunit [35, 36, 129]. IQ denotes the 11-residue consensus sequence IQXXXRGXXXR (I = Ile, Q = Gln, R = Arg, G = Gly, X = any amino acid residue) found in most proteins able to bind CAM. At cytoplasmic Ca²⁺ above ~100 nM the channel is activated with possibly partial occupation of the Ca²⁺ binding sites of CAM (Ca²⁺-dependent facilitation = CDF), while inhibition sets in with Ca²⁺ at micromolar levels when all four binding sites of CAM will be occupied (Ca²⁺-dependent inhibition = CDI). Structural studies indicate that CaCAM can change its interaction with the DHPR tail allowing it to associate with other parts of the channel near the pore.

CDF of the DHPRs contributes to the positive force-frequency effect and is believed to involve the progressive activation of CaMKII (see Section 8.4 on CaMKII). The working hypothesis assumes that at rest the CaMKII holoenzyme is free in the cytoplasm [99]. When the depolarisation frequency increases and more Ca²⁺ enters through the DHPR, CaCAM binds to CaMKII for autophosphorylation and activation. This results in the exposure of an anchoring site of the CaMKII that associates with the C-terminal portion of the α1C channel. Once the multimeric CaMKII is attached, the number of autophosphorylated enzyme components steadily increases. The tethered kinase is also shown to phosphorylate the C-terminal portion of the DHPR that is implicated in its activation. CaMKII is still active when Ca²⁺ has subsided until it is dephosphorylated by phosphatase PP1. Even when dephosphorylated, CaMKII remains attached to the DHPR. CaMKII is thus considered to operate as a Ca²⁺ spike frequency detector.

Phosphorylation by PKA also strongly activates the DHPR. While activation of β1-AR induces a more general cell stimulation by increased levels of cAMP and affecting most PKA substrates including the DHPR (Figs. 1 and 2), β2-AR acts more locally on the DHPR without significant elevation of the total cellular cAMP [117]. This targeted activation may result from locally increased cAMP around the DHPRs and is characterised by the absence of PKA-mediated phosphorylation of PLN and cTnI. Sympathetic regulation of the DHPR is facilitated by the closely associated PKA anchoring protein mAKAP in the membrane bringing the PKA close to its target [72]. The PKA phosphorylated sites are sensitive to the phosphatases PP1 and PP2a, the latter of which is bound to the C-terminal region of the DHPR.

Which of the two kinases, PKA or CaMKII, is more significant for transmitting the sympathetic stimulation to the DHPR may be difficult to decide. Perhaps the PKA represents the fast response which will be followed by the slightly delayed more sustained activity of CaMKII. The muscarinic M2 receptors can oppose the βAR activation of DHPRs by acting through Goi-coupled proteins to inhibit the AC. Multiple Goq-coupled receptors including α1-ARs, endothelin, and angiotensin-II receptors trigger the pathway leading to activation of PKC (Fig. 2). Activated Goq stimulates

PLCβ, which produces IP3 and DAG. DAG, in some cases in conjunction with Ca²⁺, activates different PKC isoforms. Results on effects of PKC on the DHPR are controversial; some find activation, no influence of even inhibition. Besides possible species differences and methodological problems, distinct PKC isoforms could also have opposing effects on the DHPR [117].

Ahnak is large phosphoprotein (5643 amino acids and ~630 kDa) that specifically interacts with the β2 subunit of the DHPR [130, 131]. The name is derived from Hebrew, meaning “giant” [132]. Recently this protein was found also to transmit sympathetic activity to the DHPR. Under basal conditions when ahnak binds with its C-terminal portion to the β2 subunit Ca²⁺ influx through the channel is reprimed. Upon β-adrenergic stimulation PKA sites in ahnak and the two Ser478-Ser479 in β2 become phosphorylated. The tight interaction between the two proteins is loosened resulting in enhanced Ca²⁺ flow. Ahnak is considered to serve as physiological brake of the DHPR conductance.

### 9.2. Ryanodine receptor at the cytoplasmic side

Ca²⁺ release from the SR via the RYR2 is the major fraction of Ca²⁺ involved in the activation of the myofilaments for contraction [10, 11, 80, 84, 116, 133]. 20–50% of the ventricular transverse tubules (T-tubules) participate in the junctional clefts also called couplons. Each couplon contains a cluster of ~100 RYRs. During excitation-contraction coupling all of the ~10,000 couplons of a ventricular myocyte are activated by Ca²⁺ influx from the closely opposed DHPRs on the sarcolemma. Of the three RYR isoforms RYR2 is the major cardiac species. RYR1 is restricted to skeletal muscles and RYR3 is more ubiquitous. RYR2 is a large protein of ~565 kDa that forms tetramers (~2,300 kDa) for one channel. The two last of the 10 putative transmembrane segments in the C-terminal portion are thought to contribute to the pore. The first ~4500 residues at the N-terminus (~80%) and the short C-terminal stretch are both on the cytoplasmic side. The large cytoplasmic portions of the four subunits together protrude into the junctional cleft where they appear as junctional “feet” in electron micrographs. Each RYR2 also serves as a scaffold for many functionally linked proteins. The following proteins were found to bind to the junctional side of RYR2: CAM, the FK506 binding protein (FKBP12.6 also known as calstabin2), sorcin, presenilin2 (PS2), CaMKII, PKA and PDE4 (splice variant PDE4D3) bind via AKAP, phosphatase PP1 binds via spinophilin, and the phosphatase PP2A binds via the scaffolding protein PR130. The interaction of RYR2 at the luminal side with its main activity regulator calsequestrin (CSQ) is facilitated by the intramembranous association of triadin and junctin. The cardiac RYR2 does not physically interact with the DHPR as is the case in fast skeletal muscle.

Channel activity is primarily controlled by Ca²⁺ entry via the sarcolemmal DHPR, which induces CICR. Relaxation of the myocardium requires a sharp termination of the Ca²⁺ release, so that resting cytoplasmic Ca²⁺ can be restored by the Ca²⁺ transporter systems [134, 135]. It was suggested that binding of Ca²⁺ to inhibitory sites on the cytoplasmic side of RYR2 causes inactivation by inducing a refractory state of the channel. The primary structure of the RYR2 contains two EF-hand domains, the second of which is inferred to bind Ca²⁺ [23]. CAM is constitutively associated with the RYR2 either as apoCAM at low Ca²⁺ (<100 nM) or as CaCAM at higher Ca²⁺ (~1 μM) [80, 116, 136]. CAM is thought to modulate the Ca²⁺-sensitivity of RYR2 to Ca²⁺ regulation. ApoCAM is reported to partially activate RYR2, while no effect, or some inhibition, was observed at intermediate Ca²⁺ levels, but Ca²⁺-saturated CAM definitely lowers the RYR2 activity at Ca²⁺ above 1 μM. Nevertheless, the role of cytoplasmic Ca²⁺ in terminating RYR2 conductance remains controversial. It seems that the RYR2 is regulated not only by the cytoplasmic Ca²⁺ but also by Ca²⁺ in the SR (see Section 9.3). In addition, Mg²⁺, ATP, phosphorylation and the accessory proteins modulate its activity from the cytoplasmic side. RYR2 channel activity may be further modulated by oxidation, reduction and nitrosylation.

The cardiac FKBP12.6 (12.6 kDa, calstabin2) is stoichiometrically bound on the outer surface of the cytoplasmic domain of each RYR2 molecule. FKBP12 (12 kDa, calstabin1) represents the skeletal muscle variety that primarily binds to RYR1 [11, 80, 116]. FKBP12.6 stabilizes the RYR2 channel in the closed state during diastole. This is important to avoid diastolic Ca²⁺ leaking through the channel, which can trigger cardiac arrhythmias. FKBP12.6 is a cyclophilin type protein with peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase) activity and derives its name from the ability to bind the immunosuppressive compound FK506 (tacrolimus). Both FK506 and rapamycin (sirolimus), but not cyclosporin-A (CsA), can bind to FKBP12.5 and inhibit its regulatory function.

Phosphorylation at Ser2808 of RYR2 by PKA attenuates the inhibitory effect of FKBP12.6 and may cause partial dissociation followed by Ca²⁺ leaking through the channel and reducing the SR Ca²⁺ content [80, 133, 137]. Mice with mutation of Ser2808 to the non-phosphorylatable alanine in the murine RYR2 behave like wild-type controls under resting conditions, but do not react to β-adrenergic stimulation as do the controls, indicating that Ser2808 is the functional PKA site in RYR2 [65]. It was recently shown that cAMP levels which regulate PKA activity are locally controlled by the PDE4 in the RYR2 protein complex providing an important negative feedback mechanisms to protect against β-adrenergic overstimulation. In human heart failure, PDE4 is significantly downregulated. This results in high PKA activity and hyperphosphorylation of RYR2 leading to “leaky” channels, which entails lowering of the SR Ca²⁺ content, contractile dysfunction and arrhythmias.

There is, however, some ongoing controversy about concurrent effects by CaMKII that primarily phosphorylates RYR2 at Ser2815, which also entails Ca²⁺ leaking during diastole and reduced systolic function without dissociation of FKBP12.6 [116]. Ser2808 can apparently be phosphorylated by either PKA or CaMKII. In a recent report Ser2030 was shown to be stoichiometrically phosphorylated by PKA, but not by CaMKII, upon sympathetic stimulation, while the degree of phosphorylation at Ser2808 did not change at all [138]. Whether additional sites are phosphorylated in RYR2 by either kinase remains open at present. If both kinases have similar effects by

phosphorylating different sites in the RYR2, and if one assumes that PKA responds faster to sympathetic stimulation than CaMKII but the latter maintains a longer lasting reaction, this may imply a timely ordered sequence in transmitting the β-adrenergic stimulus to one of the key regulators of intracellular Ca²⁺ signaling reminiscent of a similar situation with the DHPR (see Section 9.1).

Details of an additional regulatory mechanism involving PS2 and sorcin were recently reported [139–141]. PS2 (~52 kDa) is a hydrophobic protein with eight transmembrane segments that is endoproteolytically cleaved between segment-6 and segment-7 to generate a 27 kDa N-terminal and a 17 kDa C-terminal fragment necessary for functional activity. Sorcin (~22 kDa) is a Ca²⁺ binding protein that contains five EF-hand motifs. Sorcin and PS2 not only bind to one another but both can also bind to RYR2. Regulation of RYR2 activity depends on cytoplasmic Ca²⁺ that influences the varying interactions among the three proteins. Normally RYR2 is inhibited by complexing with PS2. At resting Ca²⁺ levels PS2 avoids Ca²⁺ leaking from the SR thus preserving high Ca²⁺ in the SR lumen. During the action potential when Ca²⁺ rises in the dyadic space, PS2 would recruit sorcin into the protein complex in order to inhibit the CICR process. Further studies are required to elucidate the molecular mechanism of RYR2 regulation by the dynamic RYR2–PS2–sorcin interactions.

### 9.3. Ryanodine receptor at the luminal SR side

The fast termination of Ca²⁺ release from the SR is primarily regulated by Ca²⁺ at the luminal side of the RYR2 channel [11,80,84,134,135,142]. Whether Ca²⁺ is able to achieve this by binding to the luminal side of RYR2 or whether it first passes through the channel and then binds to the cytoplasmic side is still debated. Experimental evidence indicates, however, that the Ca²⁺ signal may be mediated by auxiliary Ca²⁺ binding proteins that interact with the luminal side of the RYR2. CSQ is the most abundant Ca²⁺ binding protein in skeletal and cardiac SR. The cardiac isoform of CSQ (~45 kDa) is a highly acidic protein with over 30% negatively charged Glu and Asp residues that can bind up to ~40 Ca²⁺ per molecule with a relatively low affinity (K = ~10³ M⁻¹). The binding sites are thought to require only two acidic residues, in contrast to more complex EF-hand structures in other Ca²⁺ binding proteins.

Total SR Ca²⁺ may reach levels higher than 10 mM. Buffering of 4 mM total intraluminal Ca²⁺ by a total of 4–5 mM Ca²⁺ binding sites of cardiac CSQ in the SR would thus keep the free Ca²⁺ concentration at 0.6–1.0 mM; in other words, 50–75% of the total Ca²⁺ would be bound to CSQ. However, it is the free Ca²⁺ that determines the concentration gradient and electrochemical driving force for Ca²⁺ across the SR membrane. CSQ acts as a buffer ensuring that the luminal free Ca²⁺ remains close to 1 mM. During one contraction cycle, up to 60% of total Ca²⁺ may be released from the SR indicating that a substantial fraction of Ca²⁺ must be liberated from CSQ.

CSQ comprises three almost identical domains each of which structurally resembles that of thioredoxin [135]. With increasing concentrations from 10 up to 100 μM, Ca²⁺ first binds to monomeric CSQ, then the protein dimerises and finally it polymerises. At ~1 mM free Ca²⁺ the polymers become stably anchored to the SR membrane through interaction with triadin and junctin. Polymerised CSQ colocalises with the RYR2 to the junctional face of the SR. Depending on the species, triadin exists in two or three isoforms of different sizes. Triadin-1 (31–35 kDa) is the main variant in hearts and can be variably glycosylated. Junctin is smaller (~26 kDa) but has a similar single membrane-spanning domain as triadin. Both proteins are also found in the junctional area and interact with each other as well as with CSQ and the RYR2. The RYR2 is probably sensitive to luminal Ca²⁺ only in the quaternary complex whereby CSQ acts as Ca²⁺ sensor. An increase of the luminal Ca²⁺ concentration above physiological levels disrupts the interaction of triadin with the other junctional proteins.

Although the mechanism involved in the control of CICR still remains poorly understood, the following sequence of events can be discerned [11,84,134,135]. CSQ in the quaternary complex seems to regulate the open probability of the RYR2 in a graded response to the total SR Ca²⁺: the higher the luminal Ca²⁺ the more leaky is the channel and the lower the Ca²⁺ the more its activity is reduced. CSQ may be involved in the activation of RYR2 in response to CICR at the cytoplasmic side. After the drastic fall of the SR Ca²⁺, the channel activity becomes almost completely inhibited. This might provide a potential negative control mechanism to counter the positive feedback of CICR. Furthermore, the higher the SR Ca²⁺ load the larger is the amount released by CIRC, and vice versa, the lower the SR Ca²⁺ load at rest the smaller is the amount that is released during excitation. Therefore, the degree of Ca²⁺ depletion of the SR seems to reach comparably low levels during each activation by CICR, irrespective of the initial SR Ca²⁺ load. Consequently, the amount of Ca²⁺ pumped into the SR by SERCA2a decisively influences the amount of Ca²⁺ available for release at the following activation for contraction and thus determines inotropy.

The balance between SR Ca²⁺ uptake and release is furthermore linked to the metabolic state of the myocyte by the metabolic messenger cADP-ribose (cADPR) [10,134,143]. cADPR is produced by the enzyme CD38, a multifunctional ADP ribosyl cyclase with both synthase and hydrolase activity. This dual-function enzyme might be sensitive to metabolism, as ATP and NADH inhibit the hydrolase component, while the synthase component uses NAD for cADPR production. cADPR may potentiate the Ca²⁺ release from SR indirectly through luminal Ca²⁺ modulation by stimulation of the SERCA2a.

Several more proteins are known that bind Ca²⁺ with low affinities and may interact with RYR2 directly or indirectly such as the ubiquitous ER chaperone calreticulin (47 kDa), sarcolumenin (130 kDa), and a histidine-rich protein (170 kDa). Calreticulin is a homolog of CSQ mainly present in the ER but only a minor component in adult cardiac SR [11,135].

### 9.4. Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor

The IP3R is closely related to the RYR channel. Among the three isoforms IP3R1, IP3R2 and IP3R3, IP3R2 is the cardiac

species. In ventricular myocytes IP3R2 is scarce and contributes little to the Ca²⁺ release in comparison to RYR2 (CICR). IP3R2 is the main Ca²⁺ release channel of the ER and is also more prominent in the SR of atrial myocytes. IP3R and RYR share similarities in primary sequence as well as in functional organisation [144–146]. The IP3R is also a large protein (~2700 residues, ~300 kDa), albeit about half the size of RYR. It contains six putative transmembrane helices, the last two of which, together with the intrahelical loop, contribute to the pore and the ion filter. Four monomers together form a functional channel. Since there are splice variants, the channels may represent homo- or heterotetramers. Around 83% of the N-terminal portion plus a short C-terminal portion of <5% are exposed to the cytoplasmic side. The pores of both IP3R and RYR show negligible selectivity for Ca²⁺ over other divalent or monovalent cations. That these channels primarily transport Ca²⁺ derives from the high Ca²⁺ concentration within the lumen of the SR and ER and the large gradient towards the cytoplasm.

Reminiscent of the case with RYR2, the large cytoplasmic N-terminal portion allows for regulation by Ca²⁺, IP3, phosphorylation and several auxiliary proteins [144]. Starting at the N-terminus, the amino acid chain can be divided into a suppressor domain, IP3 binding core, modulatory domain, channel domain and C-terminal coupling domain. The suppressor domain containing two CAM binding sites reduces the high affinity of IP3 to the binding core where two Ca²⁺ binding sites are located. The modulatory domain contains one more CAM site, five more Ca²⁺ sites and is able to interact with ATP, FKBP12.6, CARP (ankyrin-repeated protein), Rack1 (receptor for activated C-kinase), as well as caspase-3 among others. Phosphorylation sites for PKA, PKC, PKG and CaMKII have also been mapped in this region. The variety of small and large components that can interact with the IP3R gives a flavor of the complexity of its regulation.

The IP3-induced Ca²⁺ release via the IP3R2 may be called IICR in analogy to the acronym CICR [145,147,148]. Experimental evidence indicates that cytoplasmic Ca²⁺ is the major regulator exhibiting a biphasic activation pattern for IP3-induced Ca²⁺ release through the IP3R2. Binding of IP3 to all four monomers in the tetrameric IP3R2 increases its sensitivity to Ca²⁺, and the channel opens only after Ca²⁺ is bound. The response to IP3 is optimal at ~300 nM free cytoplasmic Ca²⁺, but significantly inhibited at lower or higher Ca²⁺. The detailed mechanisms of the Ca²⁺ modulation are not known at present. The modulatory domain accepts only CaCAM, while at least one binding site in the suppressor domain is always occupied by CAM either in the form of apoCAM at low Ca²⁺ or being increasingly saturated with Ca²⁺ as the cytoplasmic Ca²⁺ rises. Little is known about the effects of phosphorylation by different kinases on IP3R2. PKA was shown to enhance the IP3-stimulated IP3R2. The observation that conventional Ca²⁺-dependent PKC isoforms as well as CaMKII have the same effect was obtained with the IP3R1 species. In both cases the biphasic Ca²⁺ activation was preserved. This was, however, not the case with the IP3R3 isoform that lacks the CaCAM binding site in the modulatory domain. This would implicate the binding of CaCAM to the

modulatory domain as a negative control mechanism. The enhancing effects of both PKC and CaMKII can be abolished by the Ca²⁺-dependent phosphatase calcineurin. Thus the Ca²⁺ regulation of the IP3R seems subjected to fine-tuning by an interplay between Ca²⁺-dependent kinases and phosphatase. One has, however, to bear in mind that the different IP3R isoforms may be modulated differentially.

The fast and massive Ca²⁺ release via DHPR → CICR → RYR2 occurs in an oscillatory manner to maintain the rhythmic heartbeat. In contrast, the slower reacting ligand-gated IP3R2 depends on messenger production and contributes less Ca²⁺ to the cytoplasm generating slower transients with lower amplitude and possibly locally more restricted. Several hormone agonists for GPCRs such as epinephrine (α1-AR), angiotensin-II (AT1 receptor) or endothelin (ET1 receptor) may reach the IP3R2 for stimulation via the following signaling pathway: Gαq → PLCβ → IP3 and DAG → distinct PKC isoforms (Fig. 2). Sustained increase in Ca²⁺ as well as PKC activity lead to changes in Ca²⁺ handling, contractile properties and gene expression profile, what is collectively known as cardiac remodeling [2,10,74,121,149]. All three hormones are known to be able to contribute to the development of cardiomyopathy.

### 9.5. Calcium binding S100A1 protein

It was recently reported that the Ca²⁺ binding S100A1 protein, which is primarily expressed in the myocardium, localises to SR structures as well as to sarcomeres and mitochondria [150–152]. S100A1 is a 93 amino acid protein (~10 kDa) with two EF-hand motifs, usually present as homodimer (~20 kDa). Its upregulation in ventricular hypertrophy and downregulation in end-stage heart failure raised great interest for its potential involvement in intracellular Ca²⁺ handling. Indeed, S100A1 was found to associate with SERCA2a, PLN, RYR2, and titin in the sarcomere [152–155]. Both SERCA2a and RYR2 are activated by interaction with S100A1. In the sarcomere S100A1 reduces the Ca²⁺-sensitivity of the contractile filaments in a cAMP-independent manner, and by interacting with titin along the elastic region that binds to the actin filaments in the I-band (isotropic sarcomere region), it may provide a mechanism to free the actin filaments from the bound titin thus reducing titin-based tension before active contraction. Thus the S100A1 protein increases the intracellular Ca²⁺ transients and supports sarcomeric contractility, which together results in a set stage of inotropy. This notion is supported by the finding that S100A1 gene delivery normalises contractile dysfunction in a postinfarction rat heart failure model in vivo where S100A1 is downregulated [156].

Interestingly, the S100A1 is also known to play a role in the control of gene expression in the adult heart [157]. In co-transfection experiments on cultured rat cardiomyocytes, S100A1 inhibited the expression of fetal genes for skeletal muscle α-actin, β-myosin heavy chain (βMHC) and S100B, which are activated during α1-adrenergic-induced hypertrophy, but not the triiodothyronine (T3) activation of the αMHC gene that is normally expressed in adult myocardium. This

suggests that S100A1 might be involved in the maintenance of the genetic program that defines normal myocardial function and that its downregulation is permissive for the induction of genes associated with myocardial hypertrophy. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms responsible for the various functions of the S100A1 protein have not yet been established. Could it be that the Ca²⁺ binding S100A1 “simply” provides Ca²⁺ ions next to the sites where they are required for regulation and prevents them from diffusing away? In order to support such a hypothesis, the binding dynamics between the different Ca²⁺ sites would have to be known.

### 10. Mitochondrial calcium

As a continuously working pump, the myocardium depends on an efficient and unabated energy production by the mitochondria [158]. The heart constitutes less than 0.6% of the body mass, yet it consumes around 11% of the total energy. Of any cell type, cardiomyocytes have the highest content of mitochondria with a volume fraction inversely proportional to body size and heart rate, varying from 25% in man to 38% in mice [159]. Unlike the SR and ER which evolutionarily derive from surface membrane invagination and thus support high luminal Ca²⁺, the mitochondria originate from an endosymbiotic relation of the early eukaryotic cells with a bacterium whose oxidative metabolism they subverted for their own use [20,160,161]. Consequently, the mitochondrial matrix (MM) has a Ca²⁺ concentration similar to the cytoplasm. In fact, key enzymes in the mitochondrial energy metabolism depend on Ca²⁺ regulation, which is only possible in the presence of a low Ca²⁺ background. Three enzymes linked to the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCAC), isocitrate dehydrogenase, α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase and the phosphatase that activates pyruvate dehydrogenase by dephosphorylation, as well as the ATP synthase, are activated by Ca²⁺. The Ca²⁺ concentration for half maximal activation of these enzymes lies between 0.2 and 40 μM (Fig. 4). Activation of the TCAC is paralleled by a rapid increase in NADH feeding protons into the respiratory chain at the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) to support ATP production.

In vitro experiments demonstrated rapid Ca²⁺ entry into mitochondria following extramitochondrial Ca²⁺ pulses as they may occur in vivo [79,162,163]. An as yet undefined uniporter in the IMM seems responsible for Ca²⁺ uptake into the MM, which can be inhibited by ruthenium red or lanthanides. Since this Ca²⁺ transport is not coupled to translocation of any other ion, it is considered to be a true uniporter. The Ca²⁺ uptake is driven by the proton-motive force of the inner membrane potential (around –180 mV). However, the affinity of the uniporter is low, and Ca²⁺ will not be taken up at cytoplasmic concentrations below 200 nM. On the other hand, mitochondria seem to be exposed to “hotspots” of high local Ca²⁺ concentrations delivered in their vicinity by the IP3-gated IP3R2 of the ER. Furthermore, a recent report ascribes the fast intramitochondrial Ca²⁺ fluctuations that follow the Ca²⁺ signaling transients in the cytoplasm to a highly selective Ca²⁺ channel in the IMM with a high affinity constant for Ca²⁺ of ~5 × 10⁸ M⁻¹ [164].

The removal of Ca²⁺ from the MM is energetically uphill [162,165]. The energy required for extrusion of 1 mol of Ca²⁺ is about equal to what is derived from the hydrolysis of 1 mol of ATP (~33 kJ). The outward transport is primarily effected by extrusion via an electrogenic Na⁺/Ca²⁺ exchanger probably with a stoichiometry of 3 Na⁺ versus 2 Ca²⁺. In contrast, a H⁺/Ca²⁺ exchanger may be mainly operative in mitochondria of non-excitable tissues like liver, kidney or lung. Both types

of exchanger can be inhibited by verapamil, diltiazem, clonazepam or CGP37157. Thus, in distinction to the uniporter, pharmacological tools are available for modulating the activity of the exchanger in intact cells. As long as the cytoplasmic Ca²⁺ fluctuations remain within the physiological limits the Ca²⁺ in the MM follows suit. This provides an automatic link of cell activity and energy production. While the human heart pumps 5–6 L of blood per min at rest, this may increase up to 8-fold during physical exercise. The metabolic link is given by the following scheme:

Energy demand ↑ → cytoplasmic Ca²⁺ ↑ → mitochondrial Ca²⁺ ↑ → dehydrogenase activities ↑ → NADH ↑ → ATP ↑ → energy supply ↑. In fact, oxidative phosphorylation is stimulated more rapidly by Ca²⁺ pulses than by the dephosphorylated phosphoryl carriers creatine or ADP [163,166]. Thus intramitochondrial Ca²⁺ functions as metabolic mediator allowing the myocyte to match energy supply to actual demand.

### 10.1. Mitochondrial calcium handling and overload

The capacity for mitochondrial Ca²⁺ accumulation may be significantly modulated by cross-talk with extramitochondrial signaling pathways [162,167,168]. Testing different PKC isoforms indicated that PKCβ (requiring DAG and Ca²⁺ for activation) selectively attenuates the intramitochondrial Ca²⁺ transients while not affecting the IP3-induced Ca²⁺ release from the ER. Furthermore, a p38 mitogen activated protein kinase-like enzyme was shown to tonically repress Ca²⁺ uptake by mitochondria in a heterologous expression system. Inhibition by SB202190 (pyridinyl imidazole compound), a typical inhibitor of the p38α and p38β (but not of p38γ nor p38δ) MAPK isoforms, strongly stimulates ruthenium red-sensitive mitochondrial Ca²⁺ uptake in a reversible manner. In both cases, a yet undefined phosphorylatable target may be involved that allows for selective regulation of mitochondrial Ca²⁺ handling while leaving the cytoplasmic signaling unaffected. It was originally thought that mitochondria might function as a Ca²⁺ buffer soaking up excess Ca²⁺ from the cytoplasm [13,162,169]. The close relation between cytoplasmic and intramitochondrial Ca²⁺ control in order to match physiological demands to the energy production by oxidative phosphorylation became only gradually recognised thanks to improved technical experimentation. By regulation of Ca²⁺ entry, the mitochondria may still be able to smooth out the cytoplasmic oscillatory transients in rhythmically contracting cardiomyocytes by slowing the rate of Ca²⁺ increase into the MM and lowering the amplitudes. On the other hand, since the mitochondria comprise almost one third of the myocyte volume, they can take up a sizable amount of the cytoplasmic Ca²⁺ that is distributed in their volume; thus the mitochondrial dynamics of Ca²⁺ handling must also have repercussions on those of the cytoplasmic Ca²⁺.

Mitochondrial Ca²⁺ overload occurs, however, when mitochondria are exposed to sustained Ca²⁺ levels (not transients) exceeding 1–2 μM in the cytoplasm due to hypoxia, pH <7 or metabolic stress [170,171]. The high cytoplasmic Ca²⁺ is reversed on reoxygenation providing it did not go beyond ~3 μM, otherwise the myocyte undergoes irreversible lethal injury. The combination of high Ca²⁺ levels in the MM together with high inorganic phosphate (Pi), oxidative stress and low extramitochondrial ATP induces the mitochondrial permeability transition (Fig. 4). This entails opening of the so-called mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mitoPTP) allowing for solute exchange with the cytoplasm and collapse of the potential of the IMM [162,170,171]. Precipitation of calcium phosphates totally halts ATP production and initiates cell death. Cell death can be effected in two ways, either by necrosis or apoptosis, or, as in myocytes in particular, by a combination of the two routes [13,172,173]. Because apoptosis is an energy requiring process, it is conceivable that myocytes that entered the apoptotic route, yet have depleted their energy stores, may ultimately follow the necrotic pathway.

#### 10.2. Calcium regulation of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore

The mPTP is assumed to be composed of several constituents both in the IMM and the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM). The adenine nucleotide transporter (ANT) localises to the IMM and may join the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC, also called porin) of the OMM at the so-called contact sites where the two membranes are held together (Fig. 4) [162,170,171,174]. Under normal conditions the VDAC is permeable up to a size of around 2–6 kDa allowing for solute exchange between the mitochondrial intermembrane space (MIMS) and the cytoplasm. At the contact sites, additional proteins may be associated with the mPTP, probably embedded in membrane patches containing the mitochondrial-specific cardiolipin [175,176]. The mitochondrial isoform of creatine kinase (mCK) forms a functional octamer with an internal channel and seems to interact with both ANT and VDAC bridging the gap between them (Fig. 4) [177,178]. ATP produced by the synthase at the inside of the IMM is exported by the ANT, and channeled to the active site of mCK for transphosphorylation of creatine. Phosphocreatine as the primary phosphoryl carrier is then funneled to the VDAC for diffusion into the cytoplasm. Together with the cytoplasmic CK isoform it serves as energy shuttle to cellular subdomains of intensive energy usage such as contractile structures or ion pumps to refurnish ATP from ADP on the spot [110]. On the other hand, ADP is channeled back to the MM via the ANT for rephosphorylation. In view of the limited permeability of the OMM for adenine nucleotides, this model assures that the cytoplasmic and mitochondrial ATP and ADP pools remain separated and do not intermix. In the mitochondrial cristae, mCK remains associated with ANT so that creatine and phosphocreatine need to diffuse to the VDAC of the OMM. Factors impairing the activity and/or destabilising the octameric structure of mCK in association wit ANT, were shown to increase the open probability of the mPTP. VDAC is also able to recruit hexokinase and glycerol kinase at its outer side facing the cytoplasm (Fig. 4). This may facilitate the phosphoryl exchange between cytoplasmic metabolites near the site of mitochondrial ATP production. It is furthermore suggested, that
Bax and the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor are associated with the VDAC in the OMM and may exert regulatory functions. Upon activation of Bax it is speculated that the VDAC transforms into a very large pore letting proteins pass from the MIMS as large as cytochrome-C or the apoptosis inducing factor (AIF) [179].

Whatever the precise composite structure of the mPTP, the core component is the ANT whose opening is sensitive to Ca²⁺ in the MM. At its inner side facing the MM, cyclophilin-D (CyPD) binds to ANT [162, 163, 170, 179]. CyPD is a PPIase (like FKBP12.6 mentioned in Section 9.2) whose activity facilitates the conversion of ANT into the non-specific pore when Ca²⁺ binds to ANT (Fig. 4). In the absence of CyPD, Ca²⁺, albeit at higher concentrations, is still able to induce the conformational change required for the pore opening of ANT [179–182]. CsA (a cyclic undecapeptide) acts as inhibitor of mPTP opening by preventing CyPD binding to ANT. The inhibitory effect of CsA can also be overcome by high Ca²⁺ levels in the MM [179]. Both findings indicate that CyPD may primarily function as Ca²⁺-sensitiser of ANT. On the other hand, Ca²⁺ binding to ANT is antagonised by adenine nucleotides.

Taken together, the ANT in conjunction with CyPD meets the premise of a functional mPTP which is regulated by Ca²⁺ in the MM [162, 170–172, 183]. The molecular assembly allows for a graded Ca²⁺ control. Moderate Ca²⁺ increases as well as Ca²⁺ transients spilling over from the cytoplasm, may facilitate the open probability of the mPTP. Reversible mPTP opening directly affects the IMM proton gradient driving the ATP synthase. Lowering the proton gradient reduces the driving force for Ca²⁺ entry and attenuates ATP synthesis, which may represent a counterbalance to overstimulation of the MM enzymes by increased Ca²⁺. If Ca²⁺ increases above physiological fluctuations, persistent opening of the mPTP leads to the irreparable damages described above. This mostly happens during the reperfusion period after severe ischemic episodes, when the myocyte is inundated by extracellular Ca²⁺. Whether the myocyte chooses the energy-dependent apoptotic or the necrotic death path depends on the residual capacity of energy production. When the proton gradient completely collapses, the ATP synthase was shown to hydrolyse ATP by operating in the reverse mode. Glycolysis alone is unable to meet the energy demand of the cardiomyocyte, not even at the resting state. Consequently, the cell’s life ends mainly in necrosis even if the apoptotic pathway had been initiated before. Beyond doubt, the mPTP holds the key to life or death and intracellular Ca²⁺ is instrumental in that decision.

### 11. Calcium functions as an autoregulatory signal

Ca²⁺ is unique in having the ability to act as primary messenger in the extracellular space and as intracellular second and third messenger regulating its own signaling characteristics [13, 184, 185]. Ca²⁺ concentrations may undergo fluctuations in the local microenvironment outside the cell during intracellular signaling events. The extracellular Ca²⁺-sensor is a GPCR (CaR) in the plasma membrane where Ca²⁺ acts like a paracrine or autocrine messenger. This unusual CaR is widely expressed in many different cell types and may couple to either Gαi or Gαq, though its presence in the heart has not been reported. Ca²⁺ ions entering the cardiomyocyte function as second messenger affecting some of the major Ca²⁺ handling components including RYR2, SERCA2a, and its own entry portal the DHPR, besides delivering the signal for contraction. The most important effect of Ca²⁺ as second messenger concerns the RYR2 target in order to elicit the CICR for amplification of its own signal amplitude. Thus the Ca²⁺ released from the SR in addition to what enters from outside during the action potential, has the attributes of an intracellular third messenger.

A relatively large amount of Ca²⁺ needs to enter the cytoplasm for each contraction cycle since Ca²⁺ binds to many different intracellular proteins whose Ca²⁺ binding sites compete with those of cTnC [84, 125]. For instance, the concentration of Ca²⁺ binding sites per litre of cytoplasm is ~70 μmol for the single regulatory site of cTnC and ~50 μmol for the SERCA2a ATPase sites. However, the concentration of most other Ca²⁺ binding proteins is not known. Half-maximal activation of contraction requires ~70 μmol Ca²⁺ per litre of cytoplasm to raise the cytoplasmic free Ca²⁺ only to ~600 nM. The Ca²⁺ required in excess over the 600 nM must bind to proteins other than cTnC and indicates the large buffering capacity (~100:1) in the cytoplasm.

Besides Its function as signal for single contractions, Ca²⁺ is equally important for modulation of sustained contraction activity and for the control of the gene expression program. Ca²⁺ indirectly controls these latter two functions by regulating signaling pathways of distinct protein kinases and phosphatases.

### 12. Modulation by Ca²⁺ and phosphorylation at the sarcomere level

Since the topic of regulation of contraction by Ca²⁺ binding to cTnC has recently been extensively reviewed [25, 29, 33, 186], our focus here is on modulation of sarcomere activity by phosphorylation. The inhibitory component cTnI paradigmatically displays the complexity of regulation by phosphorylation. At rest, cTnI in the troponin (TN) complex in association with tropomyosin (TM), binds with its C-terminal portion to actin thus sterically preventing the myosin cross-bridges from interacting with actin. The conformational change of cTnC upon Ca²⁺ binding induces cTnI to dissociate from actin, and the TN complex together with TM moves back from the inhibitory position freeing the sites for interaction with the myosin heads.

#### 12.1. Troponin-I and troponin-T

Phosphorylation of specific serine and threonine residues on cTnI by several kinases presents a major mechanism for alteration of myofilament properties [29, 36, 99, 187]. Along its 210 amino acids human cTnI contains six phosphorylation sites (Ser23/24, Ser43/45, Thr144 and Ser149). The physiologically predominant kinase may be PKA under β-adrenergic control
phosphorylating first Ser24 and subsequently Ser23. This increases cross-bridge cycling rate and energy consumption (positive inotropy) while enhancing relaxation (positive lusitropy) by facilitation of Ca²⁺ dissociation from cTnC (lowering the Ca²⁺ affinity of cTnC). Certain PKC isoforms, most likely PKCβ and PKCε, under the control of angiotensin (AngII), endothelin (ET1) or α-adrenergic agonists (Figs. 2 and 3), may phosphorylate Ser23/24 too, but Ser43/45 and Thr144 as well. Phosphorylation of the latter three sites seems to entail negative inotropy, lowering of energy consumption and impaired relaxation and hence lower Ca²⁺-sensitivity of the contractile apparatus. Ser149 presents a substrate for the p21 activated kinase-3 (PAK3) eliciting positive inotropy and increased Ca²⁺-sensitivity when phosphorylated. The three PAK isoforms in the heart are regulated by the small GTPases Rac1 and Cdc42 (Fig. 3) [188]. Interestingly, PAK1 also increases myofilament Ca²⁺-sensitivity, this however by inducing PP2A-dependent dephosphorylation of cTnI (Section 12.2).

RhoA-dependent kinase (ROCKII) was recently shown to phosphorylate cTnI at Ser23/24 and Thr144, but also the mouse cTnT at Ser278 and Thr287, which corresponds to Ser275 and Thr284 in the human cTnT (288 amino acids) [189]. However, the lower Ca²⁺-sensitivity and depressed contractility induced by ROCKII was caused by phosphorylation of cTnT but not cTnI. Surprisingly, yet another kinase has been discovered to phosphorylate the “PKA-sites” in cTnI, namely a serine protein kinase-D (PKD, formerly known as PKCμ) [190,191]. As PKD differs in structure from that of the PKC isoforms, it was classified into a distinct branch (the CaMK superfamily) of the mammalian kinase complement. The effects of PKD on contractility expectedly correspond to those of PKA. Taken together, four kinases (PKA, PKC, PKD and ROCKII) are able to phosphorylate the inotropically important Ser23/24. It is worth mentioning that the cTnI contains an extra N-terminal 31 amino acid sequence (not including the N-terminal methionine) with the two phosphorylatable serines which is lacking in the other two TnI isoforms stemming from different genes characteristic for fast (fTnI) and slow (sTnI) skeletal muscles. Hardly anything is known about dephosphorylation at the different sites.

There are also three different genes for TnT giving rise to multiple splice variants [29,32,186]. Mainly four splice variants are found in the heart of which cTnT3 is the predominant adult form. Apart from ROCKII, PKA can phosphorylate several additional sites in human cTnT, namely Thr194, Ser198, Thr203 and Thr284, the latter being also susceptible to phosphorylation by ROCKII. Phosphorylation of Thr203 by PKA appears to be the most important for lowering tension and Ca²⁺-sensitivity in isolated skinned fiber bundles. TM (~32 kDa, mainly αTM in the heart of small animals, plus a minor contribution by βTM in larger animals) forms a 40 nm long parallel coiled-coil homodimeric or heterodimeric protein winding over seven actin monomers along the filament. The elongated cTnT binds along the C-terminal half of TM in an antiparallel fashion thus anchoring the TN complex to the actin-tropomyosin filament [29,33,35,192]. The TM molecules function as a continuous strand, connected head-to-tail, that

changes position along the actin filament for cooperative regulation of muscle activity by Ca²⁺ binding to cTnC. Phosphorylation sites of physiological significance have not been reported for TM.

### 12.2. Myosin binding protein-C (cMyBPC)

cMyBPC (~141 kDa) belongs to a family of regulatory and structural muscle proteins, including titin and myomesin, with sequences composed predominantly of serially linked immunoglobulin-C2-like (Ig) and fibronectin type-III (Fn) domains each ~4 nm long [193–196]. cMyBPC contains seven Ig and three Fn domains plus a cardiac-specific N-terminal Ig (C0) domain. In addition, the linker region between C1 and C2 which binds to the myosin subfragment S2 (rod portion between the myosin head and the filament shaft) of human cMyBPC contains four potentially phosphorylatable serines at positions 276, 285, 304 and 362. The Ser285 is comprised within a cardiac-specific nonapeptide LAGGGRRIS (L = Leu, A = Ala, G = Gly, R = Arg, I = Ile, S = Ser) in the C1-C2 linker that is not present in skeletal muscle MyBPC[196,197].

Apparently, Ser362 is usually not phosphorylated, while Ser285 accepts either PKA or CaMKII as a prerequisite before Ser276 and Ser304 can be phosphorylated. PKC was also reported to phosphorylate cMyBPC. cMyBPC molecules trimerize with their N-terminal parts forming a collar around the myosin filament and also interact with titin, while the C-terminal portion reaches out to the myosin S2 bearing the cross-bridges. As revealed by immunolocalisation the MyBPC collars are arranged in 7–11 distinct stripes at 43 nm intervals over about half of the myosin filament length on either side of the M-band in the middle of the sarcomere. Experimentally induced phosphorylation of MyBPC seems to have little effect on Ca²⁺-sensitivity of contraction. It was, however, recently shown by biochemical studies in vitro and by transgenesis of non-phosphorylatable MyBPC in vivo, that phosphorylation of MyBPC is essential for normal cardiac contractile function [193,197,198].

### 12.3. Myosin regulatory light chain-2

Phosphorylation of the ventricular MLC2 (MLC2v, ~19 kDa) plays a decisive role in smooth muscle regulation. In striated muscle it modulates contraction characteristics by Ca²⁺ binding and phosphorylation. Together with the essential myosin light chain-1 (MLC1v, ~22 kDa) MLC2v locates to the head-rod junction (lever arm) of the myosin heavy chain [199]. Both MLCs contain four EF-hand domains each, of which only domain-1 in the MLC2 is able to bind either Ca²⁺ or Mg²⁺ [45,200–203]. It is thought that during low activity Mg²⁺ occupies the MLC2 and that partial Ca²⁺ saturation may occur under sustained activity with higher cytoplasmic Ca²⁺. The binding affinity of either of the divalent cations is about 100fold lower for the isolated MLC2 than when associated with myosin. The Ca²⁺ binding domain seems to communicate with the phosphorylation site at Ser14 (human MLC2v). In animal models the increasing MLC2v phosphorylation appears to be
correlated with positive inotropy. The phosphorylation state is, however, uncoupled from the heart beat cycle, possibly because of a low phosphate turnover rate. Nevertheless, the degree of phosphorylation by the MLC2v-specific CaCAM-dependent MLCK (~130 kDa) may set the level of contractility by increasing the $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-sensitivity [204]. Apart from regulation by CaCAM, MLCK can be modulated by phosphorylation at different sites by PKCs and non-receptor tyrosine kinases (NRTKs). Skeletal muscle MLCK (~65 kDa) derives from a separate gene and lacks some of the phosphorylation sites of the larger species.

The smooth muscle MLCK isoform of 130 kDa mass is also the major isoform in cardiomyocytes (Schaub, Hefti and Hatshorne, unpublished results). Regulation of MLC2v phosphorylation has been reported to occur primarily via control of dephosphorylation by the myosin light chain phosphatase MLCP [205,206]. MLCP was thought to be an unregulated “housekeeping enzyme” until it became clear that its activity can be controlled in different ways. The catalytic subunit PP1C (~37 kDa) complexes with the myosin binding phosphatase-targeting subunit MYPT (~130 kDa) and a small subunit (~20 kDa) of unknown function to form the holoenzyme. MYPT1 and MYPT2, both isoforms are expressed in the heart, increase the phosphatase activity at the substrate by localizing PP1C to the myosin filaments. It was recently shown on isolated adult rat ventricular myocytes that α-adrenergic receptor stimulation results in phosphorylation not only of MYPT but also of MLC2v concomitant with an increase in $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-sensitivity of tension. All these effects depend on activation of myocardial Rho kinase (ROCK). The results suggest that the signaling may take the following route α-AR → Gαq → Rho → ROCK → MYPT. Phosphorylation of MYPT causes the dissociation of PP1C so that the MLC2v remains phosphorylated under the influence of MLCK, the latter likely being the “housekeeping enzyme” in this setting. In vivo hearts have been shown to exhibit a spatial gradient of decreasing MLC2v phosphorylation across the chamber wall from the epicardium towards the endocardium, which is thought to facilitate a torsional contraction with higher inotropy at the wall surface than close to the cavity [207].

### 12.4. Titin kinase as mechanosensor

The intensive search for direct stretch-induced signal transduction by a mechanosensor has so far remained elusive [121,208,209]. However, a recent report indicates that the giant molecule titin that spans half the sarcomere from Z-disc to the M-band (>1 μm length) may regulate the expression of muscle-specific genes in dependence of the mechanical load [210]. Besides actin and myosin filaments, titin constitutes a third sarcomeric filament system. With its N-terminus it anchors to the Z-discs, runs for roughly 150–200 nm along the actin filament in the I-band region (isotropic actin filament region), then detaches from actin and heads towards the tip of the myosin filament, along which it runs to the M-band in the middle of the sarcomere. The human titin gene contains 363 exons that are predicted to code for a protein of ~38,000 amino acids. Most sarcomeric muscle proteins are typically encoded by multiple genes that are expressed in both developmental and tissue-specific patterns. In contrast, there is only a single titin gene and multiple splice pathways in the I-band encoding region of the titin gene give rise to isoforms with distinct elastic properties [211–213]. While cMyBPC comprises a total of 11 modules, titin consists of ~300 Ig and Fn modules. The main adult rat cardiac titin isoform is called N2B (~3000 kDa) with a minor contribution of the N2BA (~3200 kDa) isoform. Titin’s extensible I-band region contains mainly Ig modules plus the PEVK segment (rich in proline = P, glutamate = E, valine = V, and lysine = K) and the heart-specific unique sequence N2B in the smaller variety or N2B plus N2A in the larger species (N2BA). These three types of domain structure have distinct rigidities, which under passive stretch during diastole partly determine the wall compliance to the extension caused by the filling of the ventricle. Under stretch the I-band titin acts as a spring giving way first by straightening of the sequences that link the Ig domains, followed by extension of the PEVK segment. Toward the upper limit of the physiological sarcomere length (~2.3 μm) the extension of the N2B domain lowers the passive force levels. This decreases the likelihood of Ig domain unfolding, and thereby limits the energy loss resulting from repeated unfolding-refolding of the structured Ig domains during stretch-release cycles. The complex composition of the extensible regions in titin that extend at different sarcomere lengths, results in a force-extension curve that is shallow close to the slack length (~1.8 μm) but exponentially steepens at higher degrees of extension.

Therefore, titin is suitably located to sense length changes during muscle activity. Phosphorylation by PKA was shown to occur only in the cardiac-specific N2B-domain at a putative PKA consensus site at Ser3888 resulting in a reduction in passive force in rat cardiomyocytes and in skinned cardiac tissue [214,215]. Titin was also implicated to influence the lattice spacing of the contractile filaments and thereby to modulate $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-sensitivity. Due to its differential attachment titin runs obliquely from the actin filament towards the myosin filament and generates longitudinal as well as radial forces between the filaments, the latter of which may reduce the lattice spacing upon increasing sarcomere length. Therefore, under increasing volume load and passive stretch, titin might contribute to the Frank-Starling mechanism by bringing the contractile filaments closer together thus increasing $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-sensitivity by enhancing the likelihood of myosin cross-bridge attachment [216,217].

Of particular interest is the recent observation that titin contains a catalytic Ser/Thr kinase domain (TKD) near its C-terminus in the M-band region, that is activated through a mechanically inducible conformational change [193,210,218]. The stretch-induced conformational change allows the TKD to interact with the zinc-finger protein Nbr1 (named after “next to the Bcr/a1” breast cancer gene on chromosome-11). Nbr1 acts as a muscle cytoskeleton-associated kinase scaffolding protein in a sarcomeric multiprotein signalosome that recruits p62 and MuRF2, a muscle-specific RING-B-box E3 ligase and ligand of the transactivation domain of the serum response factor (SRF). Nuclear translocation of MuRF2 occurs at rest and
causes a reduction of SRF and repression of transcription, while mechanical activity stimulates TKD which leads to dissociation of MuRF2 from the sarcomere, export from the nucleus, and strongly reduced MuRF2 protein amounts. Thus TKD activity can modulate MuRF2 protein concentration as well as its subcellular localisation. Mechanical arrest in isolated neonatal cardiomyocytes results in drastic reduction of transcriptional activity even under persistent α-adrenergic stimulation, which under normal contractile activity induces cardiac hypertrophy. Thus the TKD → Nbr1 → p62 → MuRF2 pathway may be involved in regulation of transcription by direct transduction of the strain-induced activation of the TKD to the signaling cascade. Active TKD may trigger the cascade by phosphorylation of Nbr1 at Ser115 and/or Ser116. Whether Ca²⁺ is involved in this signaling pathway is not yet known. However, Ca²⁺ is indirectly involved in so far as it regulates contractility and contractility is the decisive factor in deactivating gene repression by MuRF2.

In addition to what is described here, there are literally dozens more proteins associated with both the M-band and the Z-discs, many of which fulfill not only structural requirements but are also involved in signaling along the sarcomere from the M-band to Z-discs and back again, as well as from the Z-discs to the surface membrane, the SR membrane, nuclei and the intercalated discs. Several reviews have been recently published on this topic [193, 211, 219, 220].

### 13. Long-term calcium signaling and cardiac remodeling

Mechanical strain represents the strongest physiological stimulus for cardiac hypertrophy. It may arise by increased afterload, hypertension, aortic stenosis or by loss of contractile elements after myocardial infarction with the remaining functional tissue being overloaded [208, 209]. The hypertrophic remodeling induces deposition of new sarcomeres either in parallel, leading to concentric hypertrophy (increased wall thickness with little or no change in chamber volume), or in series, which may accompany dilation of the ventricle. In principle, the heart responds to overload by a compensatory increase of contractile elements accompanied by distinct changes in the gene expression profile. Cardiac remodeling is a slow process, which under experimental conditions with small laboratory animals develops over weeks, while in human pathology it extends over months and years.

Providing the overload is neither excessive nor lasting for too long, this adaptive remodeling will revert back upon cessation of the abnormal mechanical input [87, 221]. However, if the overload persists, a number of factors will continuously be released that precipitate the remodeling process until it transgresses to heart failure. Definitive criteria for recognizing the point of no return are still missing. The factors involved in remodeling may comprise neurohormonal stimuli such as catecholamines, AngioII, ET1, aldosterone, cytokines, and growth factors (Fig. 3).

Most of these factors cause an increase in cytoplasmic Ca²⁺ and are reported to induce cardiac hypertrophy [98, 208, 209, 222]. Stimulation of β1-and β2-ARs increases cell Ca²⁺ by activation of the axis Gαs → AC → cAMP → PKA (Figs. 1 and 2). AngioII, ET1 as well as the α1-ARs increase Ca²⁺ via Gαq or Gαi converging on PLC signaling via IP3 and DAG (Figs. 2 and 3). The PLC axis reaches PKC, which constitutes a nodal point by spreading the signal further downstream primarily via (i) the conventional PKCα and PKCβ isoforms, requiring Ca²⁺ and DAG for activation, and (ii) the novel PKCδ and PKCε isoforms, the latter being independent of Ca²⁺ but requiring DAG for activation [74, 75, 115, 223].

Relatively little is known about isoform-specific involvement of PKC in the development of cardiac hypertrophy and progression to heart failure. The activity of PKC isoforms depends on their expression level, subcellular localization and phosphorylation state. In addition, parallel activation and overlapping isoform effects may confound signaling characteristics [39, 223–225]. Although PKCα has only minor effects on cardiac hypertrophy, it is increased in hypertrophy and critically impairs systolic function and promotes heart failure in the mouse in two possible ways, (i) by lowering the SERCA2a Ca²⁺ pump activity by phosphorylation of the phosphatase inhibitor INH1 (see Section 8.6 on Protein phosphatases), and (ii) by phosphorylation-mediated uncoupling of βARs from adenyl cyclase. The most abundant isoform in the mouse is PKCα, while in human it is PKCβ, which seems to have overlapping functions with those of the murine PKCα. PKCε was shown to mediate cytoprotective effects in myocardial ischemia and to be involved in the maintenance of cytoskeletal structures. The PKCδ isoform may be also important for maintenance of myocyte function during remodeling, since its downregulation in a Gαq-mediated murine hypertrophy precipitated heart failure with ventricular dilatation. On the other hand, PKCδ displays pro-apoptotic effects in short-term experiments. PKA and CaMKII—the latter being activated by elevated cytoplasmic Ca²⁺ binding to CAM—are more clearly involved in hypertrophic remodeling for both reinforce Ca²⁺ entry into the cell. Overexpression of CaMKII in the mouse heart was, indeed, shown to induce hypertrophy [39, 98].

Taken together, disorder of the intracellular Ca²⁺ homeostasis is a hallmark of structural heart disease. This observation was first made on cardiomyocytes from patients with heart failure in 1987 [226] and has been documented in many animal models since then [98]. It is, however, less clear whether the loss of Ca²⁺ homeostasis is a consequence or a cause of disease progression. On the other hand, calcineurin has emerged as the main agent in transducing the chronically elevated Ca²⁺ signaling to the nuclear transcription machinery [44, 227, 228].

#### 13.1. Calcineurin

The Ser/Thr protein phosphatase PP2B (calcineurin) is a heterotrimer consisting of a catalytic (~60 kDa calcineurin-A, CnA), and a Ca²⁺ binding, regulatory subunit (~19 kDa calcineurin-B, CnB) plus an associated CAM [44, 227]. Calcineurin is conserved from yeast to mammals. Besides the N-terminal catalytic domain, CnA contains regions for binding of CnB and CAM followed by an autoinhibitory domain. The two isoforms CnAα and CnAβ are derived from
two genes and are present in the heart together with the ubiquitous CnB1. CnB tightly binds Ca²⁺ at cytoplasmic submicromolar concentrations. At very low Ca²⁺ levels, CAM is not bound to the complex, and the autoinhibitory domain sterically blocks the active site. As the Ca²⁺ concentration rises, CaCAM associates with CnA thereby lifting the autoinhibition.

In contrast to CaMKII, which may be activated by high-amplitude Ca²⁺ spikes, calcineurin responds to rather low-amplitude and sustained Ca²⁺ elevations [227,229]. Apart from activation by cytoplasmic Ca²⁺, calcineurin activity is also regulated by several endogenous modulatory factors such as the large protein Cabin1/Cain (~248 kDa) and the AKAP79 (PKA anchoring protein of ~79 kDa) [230,231]. Both proteins function as scaffold for attachment of numerous proteins including protein kinases besides calcineurin. In the nucleus Cabin1/Cain functions as transcription repressor, and upon phosphorylation it can associate with the chaperone protein 14-3-3 (~30 kDa proteins forming homo- or heterodimers) for subsequent nuclear export. Attachment to the scaffold prevents calcineurin activity until activation by increasing Ca²⁺ levels prompts its substrate targeting. Furthermore, calcineurin may also be tethered to RYR and IP3R by the FKBP12 thus being kept close to its targets. In 1991 it was recognised that the known immunosuppressive effect of CsA and FK506 relies on

the inhibition of calcineurin [227,232]. The inhibition occurs indirectly by binding to the endogenous immunophilin proteins (cyclophilin-A for CsA and FKBP12 for FK506), which then interact with the calcineurin holoenzyme and sterically block its access to substrate binding (Fig. 5).

### 13.2. Calcineurin signaling

Calcineurin has been implicated in the development of chronic cardiac hypertrophy under various conditions that lead to increased cytoplasmic Ca²⁺ levels [44,223,227,229,233]. While calcineurin has a number of cytoplasmic targets, many of its biological functions are mediated mainly through two classes of transcriptional effectors, nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFATs) and myocyte enhancing factor-2 (MEF2s). Five NFAT factors have been defined so far, four of which (NFATc1 – NFATc4) are regulated by calcineurin and their activity thus changes in concert with the cytoplasmic Ca²⁺ concentration. All four calcineurin-regulated NFATc factors (molecular mass between 95–116 kDa) with multiple splice variants are expressed in the heart. Dephosphorylation of multiple serine phosphorylation sites near the N-terminus exposes a nuclear targeting signal, upon which the NFAT translocates to the nucleus where it binds DNA cooperatively with other transcription factors such as AP1 (activating protein-1 - c-

Fig. 5. Coordinated signaling by angiotensin-II via the G-protein coupled receptor (AT1) through different pathways including PLC → Ca²⁺→ calmodulin → calcineurin → NFAT and MEF2. The activation of NFAT by dephosphorylation is enhanced by the feedforward loop via the PKB pathway that leads to inhibition of GSK3β keeping NFAT dephosphorylated in the nucleus. Calcineurin signaling via MEF2 stimulates a negative feedback loop by increased expression of its inhibitor MCIP. This negative feedback loop of calcineurin is counteracted by a second feedforward loop of angiotensin-II by the BMK1 pathway leading to phosphorylation of MCIP and its dissociation from calcineurin. The PI3K → PDK1 → PKB pathway also serves growth factor signaling for adaptive hypertrophy via mTOR. The figure is composed from results in references [223,229,233,234,237].

Jun/c-Fos heterodimer), GATA4 (zinc-finger transcription factor-4) or MEF2 (myocyte enhancing factor-2) proteins. Inactivation and nuclear export of NFAT results from phosphorylation by different kinases including PKA, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), p38 MAP kinase, casein kinases, and glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β). MEF2 belongs to the MADS box family of transcription factors and consists of four classes in vertebrates (MEF2A-MEF2D). MEF2A with five splice variants (~55 kDa) and MEF2B (~39 kDa) are primarily expressed in the adult heart [227, 229, 231]. MEF2 is unique among the nuclear transcription factors in its responsiveness to Ca²⁺ signaling although the precise mechanism is still unknown. MEF2 is constitutively associated with scaffolding proteins (Cabin1/Cain) and/or other transcription factors in the nucleus. Its activity is regulated by multiple mechanisms. In activated T-lymphocytes it was shown that inactive MEF2 bound to Cabin1/ Cain can be released by binding of CaCAM to Cabin1/ Cain. Upon release MEF2 regains its activity. CaCAM also activates calcineurin, which then dephosphorylates NFAT. Subsequently, NFAT translocates to the nucleus where it associates with MEF2 and recruits the p300 protein for association with MEF2 target genes. In addition, MEF2 contains multiple phosphorylation sites, which differentially affect its activity upon phosphorylation. Phosphorylation by p38 MAPK and ERK5 (extracellular signal-regulated kinase-5 or BMK1) activates, while phosphorylation by Cdk5 (cyclin-dependent kinase-5) inhibits MEF2 activity. Calcineurin activates MEF2 presumably by dephosphorylating sites involved in inhibition (Fig. 5). Together NFAT and MEF2 activate a large number of genes encoding proteins involved in contraction, Ca²⁺ handling and metabolism characteristic for the remodeling process.

### 13.3. Calcineurin-dependent feedback by MCIPs

The calcineurin-NFAT signaling is furthermore inhibited by a protein family referred to as modulatory calcineurin-interacting proteins (MCIPs) [227, 233–236]. Three genes give rise to isoforms with various splice variants. MCIP1 (~22 kDa) and MCIP2 are highly expressed in adult heart, skeletal muscle and brain, both in humans and mice, while the third isoform MCIP3 is ubiquitous. All MCIP isoforms inhibit calcineurin by binding with their N- and C-terminal portions to the catalytic CnA subunit. In binding to calcineurin MCIP competes with NFAT. At low cytoplasmic Ca²⁺ levels little MCIP accumulates and inhibition of calcineurin is minimal. Excess MCIP in the cytoplasm is rapidly degraded. At higher Ca²⁺ its expression is enhanced by calcineurin activation of NFAT. In particular, only the expression of the MCIP1.4 splice variant is amenable to NFAT activation due to a cluster of 15 NFAT binding sites within an intragenic segment located between exon-3 and exon-4 of the gene. The promoters for the other three splice variants of MCIP1 as well as the gene for the two variants of MCIP2 s are under thyroid hormone control. Overexpression of MCIP1 in the heart suppresses hypertrophy in response to activated calcineurin as in the cases of isoproterenol or AngII infusion or aortic banding [234, 237].

In the middle part MCIP1 contains two Ser/Pro repeats (SP) conserved in the MCIP family from yeast to mammals that can be phosphorylated. Ser108 and Ser112 are specifically phosphorylated in vitro by GSK3β and ERK1/2, respectively. Phosphorylation of Ser108 by GSK3β requires prior phosphorylation of Ser112 by ERK1/2, and only Ser108 is susceptible for dephosphorylation by calcineurin [235, 238]. It was recently reported that the MEKK3 (mitogen activated ERK activating kinase kinase-3) signaling cascade is able to stimulate the calcineurin – NFAT axis and subsequent reprogramming of cardiac gene expression [234, 237]. The downstream kinases of MEKK3, namely MEK5 and ERK5 (also known as big MAP kinase-1, BMK1) were shown to be successively involved in the activation of NFAT and prior stimulation of calcineurin that is under repression by MCIP1 (Figs. 3 and 5). After phosphorylation of MCIP1 at Ser112 by BMK1, Ser108 is also phosphorylated most likely by GSK3β or a GSK3β-related kinase. Phosphorylation of MCIP1 causes its dissociation from calcineurin and docking to the chaperone protein 14-3-3 (Fig. 5). Thus non-phosphorylated MCIP1 remains bound to the catalytic CnA subunit of calcineurin and inhibits activity until BMK1-mediated phosphorylation induces dissociation and relief of inhibition, followed by dephosphorylation of NFAT and translocation to the nucleus [223, 229, 233, 234]. How the successive phosphorylation of MCIP1 is coordinated by the two different kinases is not yet clear. Such a calcineurin-dependent feedback loop might enable the heart to restrain potentially deleterious calcineurin signaling.

#### 13.4. Angiotensin-II signaling

Calcineurin-NFAT signaling is upregulated during pressure overload hypertrophy as well as in the failing mouse heart after myocardial infarction but seems to play no major role in regulating physiological cardiac growth after exercise or after stimulation with insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) in vivo [44, 223]. AngioII is one of the major neurohormones released under mechanical stress. Since myocardial dysfunction by any etiology may impart mechanical overload on the impaired as well as on the remaining viable myocytes, AngioII plays a dominant role in the pathological hypertrophic remodeling by increasing cellular Ca²⁺ and activating the calcineurin-NFAT pathway (Figs. 3 and 5). Interestingly, AngioII also counteracts the negative feedback loop of MCIP1 initiated by NFAT-induced expression, via the signaling cascade of AT1 receptor → Gαq → Ras → MEKK3 → MEK5 → BMK1 → MCIP1 [223, 236, 237]. In addition, AngioII reinforces NFAT activation by inhibiting its re-phosphorylation in the nucleus by signaling via Gβγ → PI3K (phosphoinositide-3 kinase) → PDK1 (phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1) → PKB/Akt → inhibiting GSK3β by phosphorylation at Ser9 (Fig. 5). Since the PI3K pathway via mTOR (molecular target of rapamycin) also mediates physiological heart growth induced by physical training, the question arises as to how pathologic may be distinguished from non-pathologic signaling. The answer to the enigma may lie in the variety of isoforms [223, 239, 240]. In mammals PI3K is a heterodimeric kinase with eight distinct

catalytic and seven regulatory subunits. The catalytic p110α combined with a p85 regulatory subunit (class IA PI3K) signals downstream of a growth factor-occupied RTK and Ras mediating exercise-induced growth, while catalytic p110γ (class IB PI3K) mediates pathological hypertrophy in response to Gβγ binding to the regulatory subunit p101 (Fig. 5). In addition, AngiotII signaling is known to activate several MAPK pathways.

### 13.5. Interdependence of calcineurin and MAPK signaling

Long-term Ca²⁺ signaling is thus involved in modulating gene expression during cardiac remodeling in several ways: (i) direct control of gene activity by calcineurin signaling via activation of NFAT, (ii) additional control over the transcriptional activity of MEF2, and (iii) negative feedback control of calcineurin activity via its own regulator BCIP1. Studies on transgenic mice underscore the significance of Ca²⁺ signaling in cardiac remodeling with overexpression of genes that code for proteins directly or indirectly involved in Ca²⁺ handling such as DHPR, calcineurin, NFAT, CSQ, CAM, CaMKII, and Goq-protein. All these components support Ca²⁺ signaling that results in hypertrophy and eventual heart failure [39,44,98,227,233,241]. Conversely, hypertrophy can be prevented by inactivation of almost any of these components entailing lower intracellular Ca²⁺. Inhibition of pathological hypertrophy was also obtained by overexpression of GSK3β, which by phosphorylation of NFAT attenuates its transcription activity.

In addition to the Ca²⁺ signaling axis of calcineurin-NFAT and MEF2 initiated by GPCRs [10,121,223], the gene expression program during remodeling is also under the control of the four main MAPK pathways [2,44,222,223,228] and the JAK-STAT [208,209,242] pathway as well (Fig. 3). Besides activation by the primary stimulants such as growth factors and cytokines, the MAKP pathways are also subject to regulation by GPCR signaling. From the multiple interactions among the different pathways PKC and the low molecular weight GTPase Ras (and its homologs RhoA, Rac1 and Cdc42) emerge as two major nodal signaling points. Both components relay the signaling from GPCRs to various components integrated in the MAPK pathways. This network combines the downstream signaling pathways from the GPCRs with those of the growth factors and cytokines, by merging, coordinating and channeling the information from the surface receptors to the appropriate cellular and nuclear targets.

The predominant cellular responses to the different MAPK signaling pathways have been characterized on isolated cells or on isolated beating hearts in vitro and also by transgenic approaches in vivo. All MAPK as well as the JAK-STAT signaling pathways lead to the activation of a series of transcription factors involved in the hypertrophic growth program [39,43,222,228,243]. Broadly speaking, the ERK1/2 pathway serves survival functions and by complexing with PKCε in the mitochondria has anti-apoptotic properties. IGF-1 and cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1) typically activate the ERK1/2 pathway (Fig. 3). The activated BMK1 pathway also exhibits cytoprotective effects especially with regard to the maintenance of vascular integrity during adulthood. On the other hand, the JNK and p38 MAPKs together called stress-activated protein kinases (SAPKs), are negative regulators of cardiac hypertrophy inducing dilated cardiomyopathy and overt heart failure when overexpressed in animal models [44,222]. These negative remodeling effects apparently prevail over the inhibition of transcription by direct phosphorylation of NFAT as mentioned in Section 13.2 on “Calcineurin signaling”. Some contradicting results concerning the effects of p38 MAPK may find their resolution by differentiation of the four isoforms (α, β, γ, δ). The p38α isoform is the most abundant in the adult heart, which upon activation translocates to the mitochondria displaying pro-apoptotic properties, while p38β may be cytoprotective.

The different STAT family members expressed in the heart appear to be linked to different responses such as cell growth and survival or apoptosis and maladaptive remodeling, depending on the stimulation by either cytokines, growth factors or GPCRs [242,244]. Activation by the interleukine-6-related cytokines such as CT-1 and LIF (leukemia inhibitory factor) recruits gp130 as signaling module to their respective receptors and directs the JAK-STAT pathway towards cytoprotective signaling (Fig. 3). On the other hand, JAK-STAT signaling induced by AngiotII may represent an autocrine feedforward loop by stimulation of AngiotII expression that serves to amplify its effects on the myocardium. Finally, the pathway PI3K → PDK1 → PKB predominantly serves for cell survival and preservation of cell function (Figs. 3 and 5). Three closely related mammalian PKB isoforms derived from three different genes are known (α, β, γ) that require phosphorylation at Thr308 and Ser473 by PDK1 for full activation [41,245,246]. In the heart PKB can be activated by over a dozen stimuli including insulin, IGF-1, CT-1, LIF, AngiotII, ET1, phenylephrine and acetylcholine. PKB represents another nodal point merging various signals from the cell surface receptors and spreading them in different directions. One major target is the GSK3β linking the PKB pathway to the glucose metabolism. It was recently reported that PKB is activated in samples from patients with chronic heart failure and in a transgenic mouse model chronically increased PKB was implicated in maladaptive cardiac remodeling.

In conclusion, all major signaling pathways are woven into a network that connects them and subjects them to the control of GPCRs by initial and fast Ca²⁺ signaling. Subsequently, sustained Ca²⁺ signaling may be maintained by exogenous neurohormones circulating in the blood as well as by the increased expression of autocrine and paracrine factors during cardiac remodeling.

## 14. Conclusions

A few points may emerge from the topics discussed herein. (1) It is thought that the normally functioning heart may be under constant Ca²⁺-dependent surveillance [241]. The increase of transcription that occurs during remodeling may thus result from subtle modification of the spatio-temporal properties of the individual Ca²⁺ transients. A change in frequency, increase in amplitude, or broadening of the Ca²⁺ waves may

suffice to change the program of gene transcription. However, hypertrophic increase in cell size does not simply mean “more of the same” but it entails quantitative as well as qualitative changes [1,4,44,48,247]. Furthermore, the remodeling process is characterised not only by alterations in cardiac gene expression, but it also requires coordinated control of protein synthesis, protein degradation and rRNA production. There is no single set of genes that when activated define “the cardiac hypertrophy”, but instead, large numbers of genes may be combinatorially regulated depending on the relative contributions of each factor in the ensemble of the neurohormones, cytokines and growth factors in different animal models of hypertrophy. Nevertheless, there seems to be a tendency for re-expression of fetal genes, though variable in combination, that shifts the metabolism from aerobic to more anaerobic and reduces Ca²⁺-sensitivity of the contractile apparatus, both measures that enable cells to avoid peak activities in favor of a slower pace with higher energetic efficiency. However, such changes may become maladaptive. The interrelation between the primary intracellular signaling by Ca²⁺ and the established phosphorylation cascades reflects the complexity of the coordination of contractility with metabolism and structural adaptation. The redundancy in signaling that arises from the intimate cross-connections may ensure a robust resistance against functional derailment, albeit within limited boundaries, in the face of the wide environmental and genetic variability among individuals. However, as soon as any signaling pathways become overpowering over the others and thus disturbing the balance for a certain length of time, the initially positive adaptations turn into maladaptation, eventually proceeding toward irreversible heart failure. As discussed, the β-adrenergic system exemplifies this situation.

(2) Signaling via PKA and CaMKII the β-adrenergic system adapts relatively quickly to an increased demand by letting more Ca²⁺ into the cell, so more Ca²⁺ is stored in the SR and will be more readily released for contraction, causing positive inotropy and activation of the metabolism. Several negative feedback loops prevent the system from overreacting in a harmful manner, namely by accelerating relaxation by dissociation of Ca²⁺ from cTnC, lowering of cAMP production by inhibition of AC by Ca²⁺, degradation of cAMP by PDE, βAR desensitisation by GRK and stimulation of the NKA thus lowering cytoplasmic Na⁺ (Fig. 1). Although the transition from compensated to overt heart failure is not yet well understood, prolonged βAR activity appears to lead to a fatal down-regulation of the Ca²⁺ signaling system, which is characterised by a severe reduction of SERCA2a in the SR, coinciding with an increase in the activity of the NCX1 in the sarcolemma [65,87,121,241,248, 249]. In addition, β1-ARs and PDE4 (at the RYR2) are also downregulated with a concomitant upregulation of GRK2 as well as the Gαi- and Gαq-proteins with the consequence of facilitated Ca²⁺ release from the SR. This results in the inhibition of the Gαs → AC → cAMP → PKA signaling axis causing hypophosphorylation of several proteins (including cTnI, PLN, SERCA2a, PLM, MyBPC, DHPR, RYR2) implicated in the inotropy (Figs. 1 and 2). Collectively, this leads to depletion of Ca²⁺ in the stores accompanied by systolic dysfunction. Na⁺ as well as Ca²⁺ accumulate in the cytoplasm because of the activated NCX1 operating in reverse mode during the APs occurring at high beating rate. In addition, this causes pronounced diastolic dysfunction.

(3) A general observation indicates that a number of target proteins bear a cardiac-specific sequence with phosphorylation sites, mostly near the N-terminus, which their skeletal muscle counterparts are missing and this renders the heart-specific varieties sensitive to β-adrenergic regulation by PKA and/or CaMKII. Examples are cTnI, PLN (N-terminal portion is missing in the fast skeletal muscle counterpart SLN), SERCA2a (the cardiac Ser38 substrate for CaMKII is missing in the fast skeletal muscle SERCA1), N2B sequence specific for the cardiac titin, and a cardiac-specific insert in the cMyBPC.

(4) Not only transgenic approaches but also chemical and pharmacological manipulations have allowed insight into many aspects of signaling and cellular mechanisms. Almost every intervention is likely to cause an effect at the cellular level. Whether such effects are of physiological significance is often hard to prove. One has to bear in mind that most long-term experimentation changes the endogenous protein stoichiometry by affecting gene expression and that the perturbed organism or cells react with compensatory mechanisms. Moreover, many experiments are being done on mice and rats which exhibit significant species differences as compared to larger animals or humans, especially with regard to intracellular Ca²⁺ handling [84,249,250]. For instance, contractile dysfunction in heart failure was related to defective Ca²⁺ uptake in animal models as well as in humans and SERCA2a overexpression improved contractility in animals models [251,252]. SERCA2a transfection was thus intuitively thought of as potential therapeutic strategy for patients with severe heart failure. A human knockout model of SERCA2a was recently observed in a patient with Darier’s disease, a rare autosomal dominant skin disease with no cardiac associations that is caused by heterozygous mutation of the ATP2A2 (coding for SERCA2a) gene [253]. The majority of mutations in Darier’s disease occur in the region of the ATP2A2 that encodes both the cardiac-specific isoform SERCA2a as well as the ubiquitous SERCA2b isoform, the latter being important for the skin disease. Thus Darier’s disease provides a unique opportunity to study the effects of primary SERCA2a deficiency on cardiac function in humans. Contrary to expectations, heterozygous disruption of SERCA2a is not associated with the impairment of cardiac performance in humans. Clearly this puts a question mark to the extrapolation of experimental results to therapeutic concepts even when the proof of principle has been shown in animal models.

(5) Finally, caution must also be exerted when computational simulations of such complex signaling network systems are expected to predict physiological significance. There isn’t enough data available for model optimization of a functional cardiomyocyte in silico [7,62,254]. For instance, cTnI takes a central stage in the β-adrenergically induced inotropy. Yet, cTnI contains six phosphorylation sites which can be differentially phosphorylated by at least five different protein kinases causing either an increase or a decrease in Ca²⁺-sensitivity. In principle, all thermodynamic and kinetic parameters among the reactants

would have to be known for building a comprehensive model. At present, there are just too many variables to choose from in order to compose a stringent model. This is reflected by the continuous refining process over many years in creating a myocyte model [6]. Nevertheless, such modeling is helpful in identifying unknown elements of signaling and cellular responses, which may encourage new experimental approaches.

As we have discussed in this review, many exciting new findings have surfaced during the last few years that contribute to the endeavor of gaining a deeper insight into the regulation of the myocyte function, i.e. how its phenotypic setup meets the mechanical demand.
