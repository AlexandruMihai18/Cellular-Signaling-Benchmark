SpinoCerebellar ataxia type 14 (SCA14) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease caused by mutations in protein kinase Cγ (PKCγ). Interestingly, 18 of 22 mutations are concentrated in the C1 domain, which binds diacylglycerol and is necessary for translocation and regulation of PKCγ kinase activity. To determine the effect of these mutations on PKCγ function and the pathology of SCA14, we investigated the enzymological properties of the mutant PKCγs. We found that wild-type PKCγ, but not C1 domain mutants, inhibits Ca²⁺ influx in response to muscarinic receptor stimulation. The sustained Ca²⁺ influx induced by muscarinic receptor ligation caused prolonged membrane localization of mutant PKCγ. Pharmacological experiments showed that canonical transient receptor potential (TRPC) channels are responsible for the Ca²⁺ influx regulated by PKCγ. Although in vitro kinase assays revealed that most C1 domain mutants are constitutively active, they could not phosphorylate TRPC3 channels in vivo. Single molecule observation by the total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy revealed that the membrane residence time of mutant PKCγs was significantly shorter than that of the wild-type. This fact indicated that, although membrane association of the C1 domain mutants was apparently prolonged, these mutants have a reduced ability to bind diacylglycerol and be retained on the plasma membrane. As a result, they fail to phosphorylate TRPC channels, resulting in sustained Ca²⁺ entry. Such an alteration in Ca²⁺ homeostasis and Ca²⁺-mediated signaling in Purkinje cells may contribute to the neurodegeneration characteristic of SCA14.

Autosomal dominant SCA14 is a genetically heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative disorders characterized by progressive motor incoordination affecting the gait and limbs, cerebellar dysarthria, and nystagmus due to degeneration of cerebellar Purkinje cells. SCA14 is caused by missense or in-frame deletion mutations in the PRKCG gene encoding protein kinase Cγ (PKCγ)²(1). PKCγ is a member of the PKC family that plays critical roles in many cellular functions, affecting diverse signal transduction pathways (2). PKCγ is selectively expressed in neurons throughout the brain and is most abundant in cerebellar Purkinje cells (3), which specifically degenerate in SCA14 patients.

One of the characteristic features of PKCγ is its translocation from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane (4). Translocation is a hallmark of enzyme activation and is triggered by the stimulation of G protein-coupled receptors. It is well known that activation of such receptors causes elevations of DAG and intracellular Ca²⁺ (5). PKCγ contains C1 and C2 domains in its regulatory domain (6). The C1 domain has two zinc-finger motifs, C1A and C1B, that contain highly conserved Cys residues that bind to diacylglycerol (DAG) and tumor promoting phorbol esters. The C2 domain is a Ca²⁺ sensor that binds phosphatidylserine (PS) in the presence of elevated Ca²⁺. The C1 and C2 domains play crucial roles in PKCγ translocation through binding to DAG and Ca²⁺, respectively.

The pathogenesis of SCA14 is not well understood. PKCγ knock-out mice exhibit persistent cerebellar multiple climbing fiber innervation and a slight ataxia. However, they do not have cerebellar degeneration (7, 8). Thus, gain-of-function, rather than loss-of-function, of PKCγ may be responsible for the cerebellar neurodegeneration in SCA14. Previously, we have reported that mutant PKCγs aggregate and cause cell death of several cultured cell systems (9, 10). However, the aggregation was not observed in the Purkinje cells of a SCA14 patient who carried the H101Y mutation (1). This suggests that not only the

aggregated, but also the soluble, fraction of mutant PKCγ may contribute to the pathogenesis of SCA14.

To date, 22 different PKCγ mutations have been found in SCA14 families, 18 of which map to the C1 domain (11–16). This fact strongly suggests that these mutations disturb a fundamental property of PKCγ including membrane translocation and activator-dependent regulation of its kinase activity. In the present study, we tested whether these C1 domain mutations influence membrane translocation and activation of PKCγ. Our results show that C1 domain mutants have a shorter residence time on the plasma membrane. This results in decreased phosphorylation of the TRPC3 channel and alters Ca²⁺ influx. Our results suggest that alteration in Ca²⁺ homeostasis induced by mutant PKCγ may contribute to SCA14.

[γ-³²P]ATP and monosodium [³²P]phosphate were products of MP Biomedicals, Inc. (Irvine, CA). Carbachol (Cch), GF 109203X, SKF-96395, and nifedipine were purchased from Calbiochem. 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate was obtained from Alexis Biochemicals (San Diego, CA). SEA0400 was a gift from Dr. Toshio Matsuda, Osaka University. The following antibodies were purchased: anti-cPKCγ (C-19) antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), anti-GFP polyclonal antibody (Molecular Probes, Leiden, Netherlands), peroxidase-conjugated AffiniPure goat anti-mouse IgG and peroxidase-conjugated AffiniPure goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA). All the other chemicals used were of analytical grade.

Plasmid Constructions—Wild-type and mutant PKCγs were cloned into pcDNA3 with GFP or DsRed monomer (DsRed) as described previously (9). All mutant PKCγ cDNAs were verified by sequencing. For cDNA cloning of human TRPC3, total RNA was extracted from HEK-293 cells using the SV Total RNA Isolation System (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI). After DNase I treatment, total RNA was reverse-transcribed into first-strand cDNA using random primers and the ThermoScript™ RT-PCR System (Invitrogen). PCR primers were designed based on a published nucleotide sequence of human TRPC3 (GenBank™ accession number NM_003305). Amplified TRPC3 gene was cloned into p3XFLAG-CMV-10 (Sigma). TRPC3 cDNA was verified by sequencing.

CHO cells expressing human muscarinic acetylcholine receptor 1 (CHOhm1) were a gift from Dr. Tatsuya Haga. COS-7 and HEK-293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Wako, Osaka, Japan), SH-SY5Y cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagles’ medium/Ham’s F-12 medium (Invitrogen), and CHOhm1 cells were cultured in minimum essential medium α medium (Invitrogen) at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO₂. All media contained 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (500 units/ml), and streptomycin (500 μg/ml). For SH-SY5Y cells, 1% GlutaMAX™-I (Invitrogen) was added. Transient expression in COS-7 cells

was performed by electroporation (4), and SH-SY5Y, HEK-293, and CHOhm1 cells were transfected by lipofection using FuGENE™ 6 Transfection Reagent (Roche Applied Science) as described previously (18). Sf9 cells were cultured in EX-CELL™ 420 (JRH Biosciences) containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 0.5% antibiotic/antimycotic (Invitrogen) in a temperature-controlled orbital shaker operating at 150 rpm at 27.5°C.

Observation of PKCγ Translocation—The culture medium of CHOhm1 cells expressing wild-type or mutant PKCγ-GFPs (or PKCγ-DsReds) was replaced with Ringer’s solution (135 mM NaCl, 5.4 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl₂, 5 mM HEPES pH 7.35, 10 mM glucose). CaCl₂ was added to the appropriate Ca²⁺ concentration depending on the experimental conditions. The fluorescence of the GFP was monitored with a confocal laser scanning fluorescent microscope (LSM510, Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) at 488-nm argon excitation with a 515–535-nm band pass barrier filter, DsRed was excited with a 543-nm HeNe laser and detected using a 560-nm long pass filter. All experiments were done at 37°C. Image analysis was performed using the Zeiss LSM 510 software, and the membrane fluorescence ratio was calculated as described previously (19).

Intracellular Ca²⁺ Measurement—CHOhm1 cells expressing wild-type or mutant PKCγ-DsRed were incubated with 4 µM Fluo-4 (Dojindo, Kumamoto, Japan) and 0.02% pluronic F-127 (Dojindo) in Ringer’s solution containing 2 mM EGTA for 25 min at room temperature. Fluo-4 was loaded into SH-SY5Y and HEK-293 cells in Ringer’s solution containing 2 mM Ca²⁺ (20 min, 37°C). The cells were then washed twice with Ca²⁺-free Ringer’s solution. The fluorescence of Fluo-4 was monitored by confocal microscopy. The time course of Ca²⁺ measurement was recorded using the Zeiss LSM 510 software. Fluorescence changes (∆F/F₀) within the cytoplasm of the cells were quantified as the fraction of the evoked change in Fluo-4 Ca²⁺ signal divided by the resting fluorescence level in Ca²⁺ free buffer recorded for 30 s prior to drug application. All cells within the plane of focus that had a change in Ca²⁺ signal were analyzed. All experiments were done at room temperature.

In Vitro PKC Kinase Assay—COS-7 cells expressing wild-type or mutant PKCγ-GFPs were harvested and only the supernatant fraction of the recombinant PKC was used for the PKC kinase assay. Briefly, the cells were centrifuged, and resus-

A, Cch-induced translocation of wild-type PKCγ-DsRed (WT-DsRed) and GFP-fused PKCγ carrying the G128D mutation (G128D-GFP). Wild-type and G128D mutant were transfected into CHO hm1 cells separately, and the movements of DsRed and GFP fluorescence induced by 10 μM Cch in Ringer's solution containing 2 mM Ca²⁺ were monitored simultaneously under a confocal laser scanning microscope. After 150 s, 5 mM EGTA was added to deplete the extracellular Ca²⁺. Images were collected every 10 s. B and D, the ratio (average intensity of fluorescence on the plasma membrane/average intensity of fluorescence in the cytosol) was plotted at each time point.

1 h. The beads were collected and washed five times with phosphate-buffered saline (-). Finally, 10 μl of suspended pellet was used for kinase assay as described previously (4). Briefly, the kinase activity was assayed by measuring the incorporation of ³²P into myelin basic protein from [γ-³²P]ATP in the absence of activators (20 mM Tris-HCl and 0.25 mM EGTA only) or in the presence of 8 μg/ml PS (Sigma), 0.8 μg/ml (+)-1,2-didecanoylglycerol (DiC10, BIOMOL, Plymouth Meeting, PA), and 50 μM Ca²⁺.

In Vitro and in Vivo Phosphorylation of TRPC3—COS-7 cells expressing FLAG-TRPC3 were lysed in 400 μl of homogenization buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM EGTA, 2 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 200 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.4). Samples were centrifuged (200,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C) and the supernatants were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG M2 Affinity Gel for 2 h at 4°C and the pellet washed 4 times. Recombinant GST and GST-PKCγ were purified from BL21(DE3) pLys cells and Sf9 cells, respectively, using glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences). Purified FLAG-TRPC3 on beads was incubated with purified GST (0.2 μg) or GST-PKCγ (0.2 μg) in the presence of 8 μg/ml PS, 0.8 μg/ml DiC10, and 500 μM Ca²⁺ with or without 1 mM GF 109203X for 15 min at 30°C.

For in vivo TRPC3 phosphorylation, COS-7 cells co-expressing wild-type or mutant PKCγ-GFP and FLAG-TRPC3 were labeled for 2 h with [γ-³²P]phosphoric acid (0.33 mCi/ml) in Ringer's solution containing 2 mM EGTA. After extensively washing, the cells were incubated in Ringer's solution containing 2 mM Ca²⁺ with or without 200 nM TPA for 10 min. Cells were then harvested and lysed in lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mM EGTA, 2 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, 200 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mM Na₃VO₄, 1 μM okadaic acid, 1 mM sodium fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 20 mM β-glycerophosphate) followed by sonication. After centrifugation, the pellets were solubilized in Lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, sonicated, and centrifuged. The supernatant was collected and immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG M2 Affinity Gel. SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis were performed as described (18). The

After sonication, samples were centrifuged (200,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C), and the supernatant was collected. To equalize the amount of PKCγ-GFP or its mutant proteins, GFP fluorescence intensity of the supernatants were measured by Mithras LB 940 (Berthold Technologies, Tokyo, Japan). For immunoprecipitation of PKCγ-GFP, an equivalent amount of GFP from each sample was rotated with anti-GFP antibody (1 h at 4°C) and then precipitated with protein A-Sephrose for an additional

Mutant PKCγ and Ca²⁺ in SCA14

Q127R, and G128D) were stimulated with Cch and membrane translocation assessed by confocal microscopy. Both wild-type and mutant PKCγ-DsRed translocated in response to Cch (supplemental Fig. S1). However, whereas wild-type PKCγ rapidly returned (“re-translocated”) to the cytoplasm, re-translocation was delayed in the C1 domain mutants. To assess the temporal differences in re-translocation between wild-type and mutant PKCγ, wild-type PKCγ-DsRed and GFP-conjugated PKCγ carrying the G128D mutation were independently expressed in CHOml cells and simultaneously observed (Fig. 2, A and B). Both wild-type and mutant PKCγ rapidly translocated to the plasma membrane in response to Cch. However, whereas re-translocation of wild-type PKCγ was complete by 80 s, membrane levels of the G128D mutant were still maximal. In fact, this prolonged membrane localization continued for at least 90 s; in some cases, it remained more than 3 min after stimulation (data not shown).

Extracellular Ca²⁺ Is Responsible for Prolonged Membrane Localization of Mutant PKCγ—We have evidence that C1B peptides carrying SCA14 mutations (H101Y, S119P, Q127R, and V138E) have a decreased affinity for phorbol esters (PDBu). Not surprisingly, the G128D mutation also exhibited lower phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate binding (data not shown). Thus, the affinity of the G128D mutant for endogenous DAG is also likely to be attenuated by mutations in the C1B domain. How then, are the mutants retained at the membrane? We tested the hypothesis that one of the other translocation factors, namely Ca²⁺, is involved in retaining the C1 domain mutants at the plasma membrane. Indeed, addition of the Ca²⁺ chelator, EGTA, to the extracellular solution resulted in immediate re-translocation of G128D mutant PKCγ-GFP (Fig. 2, A and B). In addition, in Ca²⁺-free Ringer’s solution, although G128D mutant exhibited a slight delay (about 10 s) in re-translocation compared with wild-type, both enzymes returned to the cytoplasm within 60 s (Fig. 2, C and D). These results indicate that extracellular Ca²⁺ is responsible for the prolonged membrane localization of C1 domain mutant PKCγ.

The Kinase Activity of PKCγ Is Required for Negative Regulation of Ca²⁺ Entry—We then investigated the effect of overexpression of PKCγ on Cch-induced Ca²⁺ entry in CHOml cells. Ca²⁺ mobilization was assessed in Fluo4-loaded cells expressing wild-type PKCγ-DsRed or unconjugated DsRed as a

Ca²⁺ mobilization was assessed in Fluo-4-loaded CHOml cells with a confocal laser scanning microscope. The cells were initially incubated in Ca²⁺-free Ringer’s solution. 10 μM Cch was added in the presence (A) or absence (B) of 1 mM Ca²⁺. C, CHOml cells expressing WT-DsRed or DsRed were treated with different concentrations of GF 109203X for 10 min before 10 μM Cch stimulation in the presence of 1 mM external Ca²⁺.

Data are expressed as the mean ± S.D. of at least four independent experiments. The asterisk indicates p < 0.01, unpaired Student’s t test.

phosphoproteins were detected by autoradiography using BAS2500 (FUJI Film).

Single-molecule Imaging of PKCγ-GFP in Living CHOml Cells—The apparatus, data acquisition, and data analysis will be described in detail.³ Briefly, individual PKCγ-GFP molecules in the plasma membrane of CHOml cells were visualized using an objective-type total internal reflection microscope constructed on an inverted fluorescence microscope (IX81, Olympus, Japan) (20, 21). Cells were illuminated with 488 nm light from a blue laser (Sapphire 488; Coherent, Japan) using a ×100 objective (PlanApo, NA = 1.45; Olympus, Japan). Fluorescence images were intensified with image intensifier (C8600; Hamamatsu Photonics, Japan) and obtained at video rate with an electron bombardment CCD camera (C7190-23; Hamamatsu Photonics). The fluorescent spots were tracked and analyzed to determine the residence time of PKCγ molecules on the plasma membrane.

RESULTS

SCA14 Mutant PKCγ Exhibits Prolonged Membrane Localization—As 18 of 22 mutations in SCA14 families are located in the C1 domain of PKCγ (Fig. 1) and the C1 domain is responsible for membrane binding in PKC translocation, we first examined whether these C1 domain mutations affect the membrane targeting of PKCγ. CHOml cells expressing wild-type or mutant PKCγ-DsRed (H101Y, G118D, S119P,

pared with its absence; $t_{1/2} \left[ \mathrm{Ca}^{2+} \right]_i$ of wild-type was not significantly altered by addition or depletion of the extracellular $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ (Fig. 4A). Thus, we concluded that the sustained high levels of $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_i$ are likely responsible for the prolonged membrane localization of these C1 domain mutant PKCγs.

The kinase activity of PKCγ is required for a rapid $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ decay in the cells (Fig. 3, $C-E$). However, the C1 domain mutants could not decrease $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_i$ after Cch stimulation. Therefore, we hypothesized that the C1 domain mutants were catalytically inactive. It is known that PKCγ is activated by PS and the DAG analog, DiC10. In addition, its kinase activity can be further elevated by the addition of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ (supplemental Fig. S3). In this system, the kinase activity of wild-type PKCγ was enhanced 2.5–3-fold in the presence of PS, DiC10, and $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ compared with their absence ($i.e.$ Tris-HCl buffer with EGTA only). In contrast, all C1 domain mutants had high kinase activity, even in the absence of activators (Fig. 4B). Despite their high intrinsic kinase activity, the C1 domain mutants could not regulate $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_i$ levels.

In regard to other four kinase domain mutants, we also observed translocation (supplemental Fig. S1), regulation of $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_i$ (Fig. 4A), and kinase activity (Fig. 4B). The V692G mutant was indistinguishable from wild-type. On the other hand, the inhibitory effect of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ entry in cells expressing constitutively active S361G and F643L mutants was exaggerated compare with wild-type (supplemental Fig. S2). Interestingly, the kinase negative G360S mutant exhibited prolonged membrane localization and sustained $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$ similar to the C1 domain mutants. These data suggest that in addition to disruption of the C1 domain, a decrease or increase in its kinase activity ablates Cch-induced $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ regulation in CHO hm1 cells.

PKCγ Negatively Regulates TRPC Channels in Response to Cch—Cch induces $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ influx through receptor-mediated $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels such as TRPC channels (22). Therefore, to test the hypothesis that PKCγ modulates TRPC channel activity to inhibit the Cch-induced $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ entry, we examined the effect of various $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channel inhibitors on $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ levels in cells expressing wild-type or G128D mutant PKCγ-DsRed. As shown in Fig. 5A, the $t_{1/2} \left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_i$ of G128D mutant was significantly longer than that of wild-type. Treatment with the TRPC channel inhibitors 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate and SKF-96395 completely abolished the excessive $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ entry in cells expressing the G128D mutant. Conversely, blocking the $\mathrm{Na}^+/\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ exchanger or the L-type $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channel with nifedipine and

Equivalent amounts of PKC (based on GFP fluorescence) were used in each assay. Data represent mean ± S.D. of at least 9 relative PKC activities obtained from at least three independent experiments.

control. As shown in Fig. 3A, Cch induced a rapid elevation of intracellular $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ ($\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_i$) in both cells. However, the kinetics of the $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ decrease in the cells expressing PKCγ-DsRed was distinct from DsRed. Specifically, the $t_{1/2} \left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_i$ of PKCγ-DsRed was $28.34 \pm 5.44 \mathrm{~s}$ compared with $70.30 \pm 8.69 \mathrm{~s}$ in DsRed-expressing cells. In addition, in $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-free solution, the kinetics of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ decrease for PKCγ-DsRed and DsRed were identical (Fig. 3B). This data suggests that PKCγ modulates $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_i$ through plasma membrane calcium channels.

To investigate whether catalytic activity is required for the negative regulation of Cch-induced $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ entry, we examined the effect of PKC inhibitor, GF 109203X, on cells expressing wild-type PKCγ-DsRed or DsRed. The $t_{1/2} \left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_i$ of PKCγ-DsRed was prolonged in a dose-dependent manner in the presence of GF109203X (Fig. 3C). Moreover, the $t_{1/2} \left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_i$ for cells expressing a kinase-negative mutant (K380M) was significantly longer than that of wild-type in Ringer’s solution containing $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ (Fig. 3D). These results suggest that kinase activity of PKCγ is necessary for a rapid $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ decay in response to Cch.

C1 Domain Mutants Cannot Inhibit $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ Entry—We then examined the effect of 17 missense mutations and one deletion mutation on the regulation of $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_i$ in CHO hm1 cells (Fig. 4A). Interestingly, the $t_{1/2} \left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_i$ of all C1 domain mutants was significantly longer in the presence of extracellular $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ com-

ing that PKCγ could phosphorylate the TRPC3 channel at the plasma membrane of Purkinje cells. In fact, PKCa has been reported to phosphorylate TRPC3 channels *in vitro* and *in vivo* (26). We first investigated whether the TRPC3 channel can be phosphorylated by PKCγ *in vitro*. As shown in Fig. 6A, significant phosphorylation of FLAG-TRPC3 by GST-PKCγ occurred in the presence of PS, DiC10, and Ca²⁺ and phosphorylation was abolished by the PKC inhibitor GF 109203X. Thus, PKCγ can directly phosphorylate TRPC3 *in vitro*. We next investigated whether wild-type and the G128D PKCγ could phosphorylate TRPC3 channels in intact cells. For this purpose, we first stimulated the CHO hm1 cells co-expressing PKCγ-GFP and FLAG-TRPC3 with Cch. However, we failed to detect significant phosphorylation of TRPC3 by wild-type PKCγ, possibly due to the transient nature of its association with membranes. Indeed, the translocation of wild-type PKCγ elicited by Cch occurs transiently (Fig. 2A). Therefore, TPA was used as it induces irreversible translocation of wild-type PKCγ to the plasma membrane and maximally stimulates PKCγ (4).

In COS-7 cells co-expressing FLAG-TRPC3 and wild-type PKCγ-GFP, 200 nM TPA significantly enhanced the phosphorylation of FLAG-TRPC3, an increase of 1.89 ± 0.14-fold in PKCγ overexpressing cells (Fig. 6, B and C). On the other hand, in COS-7 cells co-expressing FLAG-TRPC3 and constitutively active G128D mutant PKCγ-GFP, FLAG-TRPC3 was significantly less phosphorylated, exhibiting an increase only of 1.33 ± 0.25 in response to TPA, which was not significantly different from the GFP control. Similar results were obtained when another constitutively active C1 domain mutant (H101Y) was used (data not shown). These results suggest that C1 domain mutants cannot phosphorylate endogenous substrates, despite their high catalytic activity.

**C1 Domain Mutant Decreases the Residence Time of PKCγ on the Plasma Membrane—Inaccessibility of PKCγ to the substrate may explain why the constitutively active C1 domain mutant PKCγ do not phosphorylate TRPC3 channels in the cells. As C1B domain mutations have a decreased affinity for membrane lipids,** we used total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy to determine how long wild-type and mutant PKCγ-GFP (H101Y, G128D, and G360S) stay on the plasma membrane.

SEA0400, respectively, had no effect. These results suggest that the Cch-induced change in [Ca²⁺] is mediated by TRPC channels. We next examined the effect of PKCγ on the Cch-induced Ca²⁺ response in HEK-293 and human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells, cells that endogenously express muscarinic receptors. Similarly to CHO hm1 cells, wild-type, but not the G128D mutant, negatively regulated Ca²⁺ influx in both cell types (Fig. 5B). This result suggests that the negative regulation of [Ca²⁺] by PKCγ likely occurs in neurons that endogenously express PKCγ and TRPC channels. Interestingly, although much of the data on Ca²⁺ responses in HEK-293 cells were similar to CHO hm1 and SH-SY5Y cells, Ca²⁺ oscillations were frequently observed in cells expressing wild-type but not the G128D mutant (data not shown). Taken together, these results suggest that Ca²⁺ influx regulated by PKCγ likely depends on plasma membrane Ca²⁺ channels, especially TRPC channels. However, the G128D mutant lacks the ability to regulate these channels.

When we imaged the ventral surface of the CHOml cells
expressing PKCγ-GFP using TIRF microscopy and a highly
sensitive imaging system at the video rate (20, 27), many fluo-
rescent spots appeared on the plasma membrane (supplemen-
tary videos 1–4). We could not observe such spots in the mock-
treated control cells. Because the distribution of their
fluorescence intensity exhibited a single peak and the peak posi-
tion of the distribution is slightly lower than that for recombi-
nant GFP attached on the coverslip, or for GFP-tagged Ras
imaged at the single molecule level (27) (supplementary Fig.
S4), we concluded that each spot mostly represents a single
molecule of PKCγ-GFP.

Cells were stimulated with TPA to analyze membrane target-
ing through the Cl domain. In response to TPA, a single mol-
ecule of wild-type appeared at the plasma membrane and
moved around in the plane of the membrane for more than 20 s.
The residence time of wild-type on the membrane averaged
22.1 s (Fig. 7, left column, supplemental Videos 1–4). In con-
trast, the residence time of the H101Y and G128D Cl domain
mutants was dramatically short (3.0 and 1.3 s, respectively). On
the other hand, the G360S mutant, which has an intact Cl
domain, was indistinguishable from wild type. We also meas-
ured the residence time of the Cl domain mutant in response to
Cch. Compared with wild-type PKCγ, the H101Y and G128D
mutants had significantly shorter residence times (~60% of

wild type) (Fig. 7, right column), suggesting that Cl domain mutants do
not stably associate with their phys-
iological binding partner DAG. The
result of this shortened membrane
retention time is decreased phos-
phorylation of PKCγ substrates,
such as TRPC3 channels, on the
plasma membrane.

DISCUSSION

SCA14 is inherited as autosomal
dominant and PKCγ-deficient mice
do not exhibit atrophy of the cere-
bellum or loss of Purkinje cells (8).
Therefore, we considered that gain-
of-function, rather than loss-of-
function, of mutant PKCγ causes
neurodegeneration in SCA14. Pre-
viously, we demonstrated that, sim-
ilar to other neurodegenerative dis-
orders, the mutant PKCγ found in
SCA14 tends to aggregate and cause
cell death (9). However, although
immunoreactivity of PKCγ was
reduced, the aggregation was not
observed in Purkinje cells of an
autopsy of a SCA14 patient who car-
ried the H101Y mutation (1). There-
fore, we suspected the gain-
of-toxic function of the soluble pro-
tein in addition to the aggregation
that mutant PKCγ may contribute
to neurodegeneration in SCA14.

In the present study, we have shown that expression of Cl
domain mutants of PKCγs results in sustained Ca²⁺ influx into
the cells due to a decrease in membrane residence time. In
addition, cells expressing the G360S mutant PKCγ also caused
sustained Ca²⁺ influx resulting from its kinase inactivity. Wild-
type PKCγ negatively regulated Cch-induced Ca²⁺ entry via
phosphorylation of TRPC3 channels. For TRPC3 phosphoryla-
tion, both Cl domain-mediated membrane binding and kinase
activity of PKCγ are indispensable.

On the other hand, cells expressing S361G and F643L PKCγs
with an intact Cl domain and a high kinase activity, were able to
suppress Ca²⁺ entry after physiological stimulation. Interest-
ingly, this inhibitory effect was exaggerated compared with
wild-type and Ca²⁺ influx was completely blocked. This finding
suggests that a constitutively active PKCγ with a functional Cl
domain may cause hyperphosphorylation of substrates on the
plasma membrane. Thus, not only the sustained Ca²⁺ influx
but also inhibition of Ca²⁺ entry might alter intracellular Ca²⁺
homeostasis in SCA14 patients (Fig. 8).

By confocal microscopy, TPA and the Ca²⁺ ionophore
induced similar PKCγ localization at the plasma membrane (4,
28). However, electron microscopy revealed that PKCγ has
similar, but significantly different, localization depending on
stimulation. Whereas DAG or TPA tightly anchored this

tribute to the stable association of PKCγ with membranes; mutations in either decrease membrane residence time.

The data in Fig. 2A suggested that C1 domain mutants stay longer on the plasma membrane than wild-type. Thus, we predicted increased substrate phosphorylation. However, this was not the case. Mutations in the C1 domain decrease PKCγ-DAG binding, membrane retention time, and substrate phosphorylation. Indeed, the G128D mutant could not phosphorylate TRPC3 on the plasma membrane. These results emphasize the importance of the C1 domain for membrane binding and substrate phosphorylation.

It is reported that of the 50 amino acids in the C1B domain in PKCγ, residues 101–143 mediate phorbol ester binding (30). Although C150F mutation is outside this core region, the C150F mutant could not control intracellular Ca²⁺ concentrations and kinase activity. This indicates that C150F does not have a functional C1B domain and cannot associate with DAG. The substitution of phenylalanine for cysteine is thought to induce a conformational change in the C1B domain that inhibits DAG/phorbol ester binding. Increased kinase activity of the C150F mutant was also reported by Verbeek et al. (31). Moreover, they demonstrated that, in COS-7 cells, Ca²⁺ ionophore induces more rapid translocation of the C150F mutant than wild-type PKCγ. We also observed that Ca²⁺ influx-mediated rapid and enhanced translocation of PKCγs carrying the C1 domain mutation in the CHOml cell (data not shown). PKC is known to enhance Ca²⁺ efflux through phosphorylation of the plasma membrane Ca²⁺-ATPases (32). As is the case with the lower phosphorylation of the TRPC3 channel by the G128D mutant, these C1 domain mutants may also fail to phosphorylate the plasma membrane Ca²⁺-ATPases. Therefore, enhancement of the Ca²⁺ efflux by PKCγ may not occur in cells expressing C1 domain mutant, thus, an increase of intracellular Ca²⁺ would induce strong translocation of mutant PKCγ.

In Purkinje cells, TRPC3 is the most abundantly expressed member of the TRPC family (24). However, its specific roles in the neurons are largely unknown. It has been reported that the mGluR-dependent slow excitatory postsynaptic currents require the activation of TRPC channels in Purkinje cells (33). PKCγ also plays a key role in mGluR signaling. Therefore, the loss of inhibition of TRPC activity due to its decreased phosphorylation by mutant PKCγ may indirectly activate slow excitatory postsynaptic currents. Interestingly, an ataxic phenotype is observed in various knock-out mice that are deficient in the components of the mGluR cascade (e.g. mGluR1, Gq, PLCβ, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor, and PKCγ) (34–37). Moreover, TRPC3 knock-out mice also exhibit abnormal motor coordination.⁵ Therefore, abnormal regulation of TRPC channels, as seen in cells expressing C1B mutants of PKCγ, may contribute to cerebellar dysfunction.

Although intracellular Ca²⁺ signals are critical for the regulation of synaptic functions in the central nervous system, sustained high levels of intracellular Ca²⁺ can be toxic for neurons. For example, dysregulation of intracellular Ca²⁺ has been reported in aging brain and been implicated in vulnerability to

The histograms were fitted to single exponential functions (solid lines). The τ values indicate the time constants of the fit function.

enzyme on the plasma membrane, Ca²⁺ ionophore resulted in the accumulation of PKCγ to a submembrane region <500 nm from the plasma membrane (28). Thus, we, in these studies, employed TIRF microscopy, which is generally able to visualize the PKCγ within 100–150 nm of the plasma membrane. TIRF provides a readout of events occurring essentially at the membrane. These studies revealed that the C1B mutants are at the plasma membrane for significantly less time that wild-type. This results in decreased signaling as measured by the lower phosphorylation of the TRPC3 channels.

PKCγ has two DAG binding regions, C1A and C1B, and it is reported that both bind equally to DAG or phorbol ester (29). Although SCA14 mutations affect only one region of the C1 domain, the membrane residence time of mutant PKCγs induced by Cch or TPA were significantly shorter than that of wild-type. These results suggest that both C1A and C1B con-

FIGURE 8. Schematic illustration for the dysfunction of intracellular Ca²⁺ regulation by mutant PKCγ. In response to physiological stimulation, increase in Ca²⁺ and generation of DAG occur in the cells. DAG activates TRPC3 channel and induces Ca²⁺ influx. At the same time, Ca²⁺ binds to PKCγ and induces translocation near the plasma membrane (1, 4). Wild-type PKCγ binds to DAG through its C1 domain on the plasma membrane and phosphorylates the TRPC3 channel. This phosphorylation blocks further the Ca²⁺ influx through TRPC3 channels (2). Then, wild-type PKCγ rapidly re-translocates to the cytosol in response to a decrease in intracellular Ca²⁺ (3). On the other hand, mutant PKCγ cannot phosphorylate the TRPC3 channel, because they do not bind to DAG on the plasma membrane (5). Therefore, Ca²⁺ influx is sustained and the Ca²⁺ binding mutant PKCγ stays longer near the plasma membrane. It appears as the prolonged membrane localization of mutant PKCγ (6).

neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer disease (38, 39). In addition, increases in intracellular Ca²⁺ through Ca²⁺-permeable α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid channels produce reactive oxygen species and, in some cases, nitric oxide (40). These reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide are known to cause neuronal injury in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Recent data demonstrates an abundance of S-nitrosylated proteins in the brains of Alzheimer and Parkinson victims (41, 42). Sustained high levels of intracellular Ca²⁺ lead to increased nitric oxide, elevated S-nitrosylation of proteins, and protein aggregation. One potential target of nitric oxide is heat shock protein (Hsp) (17), whose function in cells is thought to repair misfolded proteins. However, its activity can be inhibited by S-nitrosylation. Thus, in our model, mutant PKCγ causes a sustained high level of intracellular Ca²⁺ that increases nitric oxide and S-nitrosylation of Hsp, and results in the accumulation of aggregated proteins. If this model is correct, we would predict that overexpression of Hsp should bypass the effects of mutant PKCγ, and decrease protein aggregation. In fact, current evidence from our laboratory indicates that protein aggregation and cytotoxicity induced by mutant PKCγ can be inhibited by overexpression of Hsp70.⁴ Although sustained Ca²⁺ influx was caused by “loss-of-function” of PKCγ, it is possible that aberrant regulation of intracellular Ca²⁺ enhances the misfolding of mutant PKCγ in the long term.

In the case of the V692G mutation, which occurs in the variable region of the PRKCG gene, the patterns of kinase activity, membrane targeting, and intracellular Ca²⁺ regulation were very similar to those of the wild-type enzyme. Interestingly, aggregation of this mutant was not observed in CHOml and SH-SY5Y cells (data not shown). Thus, it is possible that another mutation might be responsible for the SCA phenotype.

To understand the pathogenesis of SCA14, it is necessary to compare Ca²⁺-mediated signaling, aggregation, and loss of PKCγ in Purkinje cells derived from SCA14 patients with normal controls. However, as SCA14 is rare, but not fatal, it is difficult to study the pathogenesis of the disease using human brain tissue. Thus, the generation of an animal model of SCA14 is necessary.

In summary (Fig. 8), we have studied the effects of SCA14 PKCγ mutations on Cch-induced Ca²⁺ influx and TRPC channel phosphorylation. We have shown that the phosphorylation of TRPC channels is reduced in cells expressing the C1 domain mutant PKCγ, resulting in sustained high levels of intracellular Ca²⁺ upon cell stimulation. Surprisingly, the mutant PKCγ have higher kinase activity in vitro but cannot stably associate with the plasma membrane. These results suggest that mutant PKCγs fail to phosphorylate TRPC3 channels leading to sustained high levels of intracellular Ca²⁺ and aberrant intracellular signaling. Such an alteration in Ca²⁺ homeostasis and Ca²⁺-mediated signaling in Purkinje cells may be responsible for the neurodegeneration characteristic of SCA14.
