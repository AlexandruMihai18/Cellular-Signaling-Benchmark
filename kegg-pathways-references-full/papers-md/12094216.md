SYNAPTOTAGMIN: A Ca²⁺ SENSOR THAT TRIGGERS EXOCYTOSIS?

**Edwin R. Chapman**

It has been fifty years since the discovery that Ca²⁺ triggers the rapid exocytosis of neurotransmitters from neurons. One of the proteins that has a crucial role in this secretion event is synaptotagmin I, an abundant constituent of synaptic vesicles that binds Ca²⁺ ions through two C2 domains. These properties prompted the idea that synaptotagmin I might function as a Ca²⁺-sensor that triggers neurotransmitter release. So does synaptotagmin trigger exocytosis in a Ca²⁺-dependent manner, and, if so, how does it operate?

**ACTION POTENTIAL**  
A propagating impulse of voltage in excitable cells.

Communication between neurons is mediated by the release of neurotransmitters from synaptic vesicles (SVs)¹² (FIG. 1a). SV exocytosis is one of the ‘fastest things that animal cells do’³, and occurs on the micro-to millisecond timescale⁴⁻⁶. Rapid release rates allow for high-frequency signalling across synapses, which has wide-ranging implications; for example, in the processing of sensory information. Moreover, in some synapses the efficiency of the release process determines, at least in part, synaptic strength. In many synapses, the probability that an ACTION POTENTIAL will drive the fusion of a vesicle varies, which provides a means to tune synaptic efficacy⁷. Whether or not a synapse ‘succeeds’ or ‘fails’ is thought to be a key aspect of memory and learning. Recent studies also indicate that even open fusion pores might give rise to different postsynaptic responses. For example, fusion pores with reduced efflux rates might yield glutamate concentrations in the cleft that are insufficient to activate postsynaptic AMPA (α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolpropionate) receptors⁸⁹. Glutamate is the main excitatory neurotransmitter in brain, and AMPA receptors mediate most of the fast glutamatergic transmission between neurons. Either failure to release neurotransmitter, or insufficient efflux through open fusion pores, would give rise to ‘silent synapses’ — a well-characterized phenomenon that also has established postsynaptic components¹⁰. Again, silencing or awakening of synapses is thought to mediate aspects of synaptic plasticity.

Our understanding of the molecular mechanism that mediates exocytotic membrane fusion is rapidly advancing. Many, if not all, intracellular membrane-fusion events require the assembly of SNARE (soluble N-ethyl-maleimide-sensitive fusion protein (NSF) attachment protein receptor) complexes, which are composed of proteins that are anchored to each of the membranes that are destined to fuse¹¹,¹² (FIG. 1b). In the case of neurons, the SNARE complex is composed of the vesicle protein synaptobrevin (or VAMP, vesicle-associated membrane protein) and the plasma-membrane proteins syntaxin and SNAP-25 (synaptosome-associated protein of 25 kDa)¹³. The cytoplasmic domains of these proteins assemble into a four-helix bundle that pulls the vesicle and target membranes together¹⁴. Assembly of this complex can catalyse the fusion of proteoliposomes *in vitro*, which indicates that SNAREs form the core of a conserved membrane-fusion machine¹⁵ (BOX 1). However, fusion that is mediated by purified SNAREs occurs on long timescales (minutes) and is not regulated by Ca²⁺. These findings indicate that Ca²⁺ sensors, as well as other accessory proteins, are likely to function in conjunction with SNAREs to drive the fast and tightly regulated SV fusion that occurs at synapses. These extra components would serve to turn SNAREs ‘off’ until fusion is triggered¹⁶, and to accelerate their function on arrival of the trigger.

This review will focus on studies that are directed towards understanding how Ca²⁺ triggers exocytosis.

This is a timely issue — a compelling family of candidate proteins, the synaptotagmins¹⁷, have been identified, and recent advances have made it possible to begin to address the precise function of synaptotagmins during exocytosis. The first glimpses of Ca²⁺-triggered molecular rearrangements that mediate neuronal exocytosis are close at hand.

### Figure 1 | The synaptic-vesicle cycle.
a | Vesicles are loaded with neurotransmitters (yellow) and targeted to specialized regions on the plasma membrane called ACTIVE ZONES, where they become stably bound, or docked. After docking, a series of reactions that require ATP and components of the cytosol occur, which makes the vesicles competent for fusion¹⁰². After these ‘PRIMING’ steps, vesicles are largely quiescent until the nerve terminal is invaded by an action potential, which triggers the influx of Ca²⁺ ions through voltage-activated Ca²⁺ channels. Ca²⁺ activates presynaptic Ca²⁺-sensors that, in turn, trigger the opening of fusion pores². The speed of exocytosis indicates that the molecules that constitute the pore must be recruited and partially pre-assembled before arrival of the Ca²⁺ signal; there is not enough time, for example, to recruit soluble factors or to carry out slow enzymatic reactions. Fusion pores dilate to mediate the complete fusion of the vesicle with the target membrane, or close in a reversible reaction, termed ‘kiss-and-run’⁸⁴,¹³⁸. Both modes of release are thought to occur, but the relative contribution of these two modes in synaptic transmission is not known. After complete fusion, coat proteins assemble onto the fused vesicle membrane, and form clathrin-coated pits (shown in green and red) that bud off the plasma membrane⁷⁵,⁷⁶. After uncoating, the vesicles are reloaded with transmitters for re-use. Intermediate synaptic-vesicle transport through an endosomal compartment has been omitted as this step might not have a role in typical trafficking⁷⁵,⁷⁶.

This model is based on the crystal structures of the cytoplasmic domains of synaptotagmin III (REF. 30) and the neuronal SNARE complex¹⁴. In synaptotagmin III, the Ca²⁺-ligands are shown in yellow and the metal ions (Mg²⁺ in this case — three in the C2A domain and one in the C2B domain) are shown in red.

### Structure of synaptotagmin

The discovery that neuronal exocytosis is triggered by Ca²⁺ (REF. 18) started a search for presynaptic Ca²⁺ sensors. In 1981, a monoclonal antibody raised against synaptic junctional complexes showed the presence of a 65-kDa antigen — p65 — that was localized to SVs¹⁹ and LARGE DENSE CORE VESICLES (LDCVs)²⁰. p65 remained obscure until it was cloned by Perin *et al.*²¹, who found that its cytoplasmic domain is composed of tandem Ca²⁺-binding motifs called **C2 domains**. The first C2 domain (moving from the amino to the carboxyl terminus) was called C2A, and the carboxy-terminal C2 domain was named C2B (BOX 2). p65 was then renamed synaptotagmin I (REF. 22). Since the initial cloning, a total of thirteen isoforms have been identified, and partial sequences in databases point to six further isoforms²³. All members of this gene family span the vesicle membrane once, have short intravesicular domains and large cytoplasmic domains composed of two C2 domains, which are connected by a short linker (FIG. 1b). Synaptotagmin I is the most abundant (~7% of the total vesicle protein²⁴) Ca²⁺-sensing protein on the surface of SVs, and has therefore gathered considerable interest as a potential Ca²⁺ sensor that regulates SV exocytosis²⁵.

What does synaptotagmin look like, and how does it bind Ca²⁺? The C2A domain of synaptotagmin I was the first C2-domain structure to be determined²⁶. Subsequent analysis of other C2 domains showed common overall structures — compact eight-stranded β-sandwiches, in which the β-strands are connected by loops that in some instances contain insertions²⁷ (FIG. 2). The connectivity patterns of the β-strands are found in two ‘flavours’ that give rise to type I and type II topologies. This results from a simple change in the connections of the β-strands such that the amino and carboxyl termini exit the domain either at the ‘top’ (towards the Ca²⁺-binding sites) or towards the ‘bottom’ of the C2 domain (FIG. 2). This does not significantly affect the overall structure of individual C2 domains, but would affect the relative orientation of the C2 domains in the context of the parent polypeptide. Synaptotagmin is not unique in having tandem C2 domains — about one-third of C2-domain-harbouring proteins contain more than one copy of this motif. In a few cases, the structure of C2B has been determined and, in each case, this domain was found to have one or two extra short α-helices at the ‘bottom’ of the domain (away from the Ca²⁺-binding sites)²⁸⁻³⁰. Future studies are needed to establish the generality of this structural specialization. Studies that implicate this helical region in synaptotagmin function have focused on deletion mutants or peptides, but as this region is tightly folded and is part of the overall structure of C2B, the results of such studies are difficult to interpret³¹⁻³³.

Synaptotagmin I seems to bind a total of five Ca²⁺ ions²⁵ — three are bound by C2A (REF. 34) and two by C2B (REF. 28; FIG. 2). Binding of Ca²⁺ in these sites, and in the sites of other C2 domains, is largely mediated by two flexible loops that protrude from the top of the domain. These loops resemble flexible jaws that are stabilized by Ca²⁺ binding. Ca²⁺ ions are largely coordinated by a

Box 1 | Does the SNARE complex mediate membrane fusion?

Studies of membrane transport through the Golgi apparatus led to the discovery of a set of soluble factors, called N-ethyl-maleimide (NEM) sensitive factor (NSF) and soluble NSF attachment proteins (SNAPs)¹¹. SNAPs are adaptor proteins that mediate the binding of NSF to Golgi membranes, where these proteins have an essential role in membrane transport. Using immobilized NSF and SNAPs, the receptors for these proteins (designated as SNAP receptors or SNAREs) were purified from rat brain detergent extracts (FIG. 1b). As discussed in the text, it is well established that SNAREs are essential for membrane fusion¹², and can catalyse the fusion of reconstituted proteoliposomes *in vitro*¹⁵. However, it is not universally established that SNAREs drive the final steps of membrane fusion *in vivo*.

Studies of yeast vacuolar fusion indicate that SNARE complexes execute their essential function at a step before the fusion reaction¹²⁵. Evidence for this model comes from the finding that, after this putative step is complete, subsequent disassembly of all but a small proportion of the *trans*-SNARE complexes has no apparent effect on the rate or extent of fusion¹²⁵. However, if SNARE-complex assembly is not rate limiting under these conditions, effects on the rate of fusion would not be expected. In other words, the small proportion of SNARE complexes that can assemble at steady state under those experimental conditions might be sufficient to drive normal rates of fusion. It should also be noted that the result of the vacuolar-fusion assay relies on the ability of a protease from one vacuole to encounter its substrate in another vacuole. It is possible that fusion still occurs, but that the fusion pores are too small under these conditions to allow the passage of these proteins. Further studies in yeast led to the suggestion that the final step of vacuole–vacuole fusion is mediated by *trans* complexes of the $V_{0}$ SECTOR of the VACUOLAR H⁺-ATPASE⁸⁶. However, mutations in the $V_{0}$ sector only delay fusion, whereas mutations in SNAREs can block fusion (for a review, see REF. 86). At present, SNARE-mediated fusion remains a leading model, but this issue is far from resolved.

domains of synaptotagmin have also been implicated in intramolecular interactions in which C2A and C2B come together in response to Ca²⁺ (REF.49). However, this effect occurs only at high Ca²⁺ concentrations (EC₅₀ value of ~3 mM Ca²⁺), and Mg²⁺ — which does not trigger exocytosis — was as effective at mediating this effect as Ba²⁺ and Sr²⁺, which do trigger release⁵³.

Synaptotagmins in exocytosis and endocytosis

*A post-docking function in exocytosis.* The physiological function of synaptotagmin I has been studied by microinjecting cells with inhibitors of putative effector interactions and by genetic studies. Inhibition studies using anti-synaptotagmin antibodies and recombinant fragments of synaptotagmin pointed to a crucial role for the protein in secretion⁵⁴⁻⁵⁶. Furthermore, peptides that correspond to conserved regions in the C2A and C2B domains resulted in a post-docking block in exocytosis⁵⁷. The strength of these studies is that they are acute, but there is concern as to whether or not a given inhibitor specifically blocks a synaptotagmin–effector interaction. In the following discussions, we focus on recent insights that have been obtained through genetic manipulations of synaptotagmin I.

Disruption of the synaptotagmin I gene in mice largely abolished the rapid component of exocytosis⁵⁸. This phenotype does not seem to involve a reduction in the total number of releasable vesicles, as hypertonic sucrose can drive the release of the same number of vesicles from wild-type and null-mutant synapses⁵⁹. Hypertonic sucrose acts through an unknown mechanism to drive release, but this mechanism is known to require SNAREs as well as Munc13 (a presynaptic protein that contains C2 domains and binds diacylglycerol)⁶⁰,⁶¹, and sucrose-releasable vesicles are thought to represent a ‘readily-releasable pool’⁶². These data indicate that synaptotagmin I has a post-docking function, and that it acts at a part of the release pathway that is after the vesicles have matured to a stage at which they can be released by the hypertonic-sucrose trigger.

It is important to note that knockout studies do not provide mechanistic insights into this post-docking function. The same phenotype might arise if synaptotagmin served to tether the release machinery near to sites of Ca²⁺ influx⁶³, or if synaptotagmin functioned in the maturation of vesicles into a rapidly releasable state or in the stabilization of these vesicles⁶⁴, to prepare them for the action of the Ca²⁺ sensor that drives synchronous release. The first possibility was supported by the ability of synaptotagmin I to directly interact with various Ca²⁺ channels⁶⁵,⁶⁶ and to relieve syntaxin-mediated inhibition of channel function⁶⁷. However, in chromaffin cells, the rapid component of release is diminished in the absence of synaptotagmin I even when Ca²⁺ is raised in a uniform manner using FLASH PHOTOLYSIS OF CAGED Ca²⁺ (REF.64). Furthermore, disruption of synaptotagmin I did not affect Ca²⁺ currents in chromaffin cells⁶⁴, and overexpression of synaptotagmin I and synaptotagmin IV did not affect Ca²⁺ currents in transfected PC12 cells⁵². Similar studies in hippocampal neurons could be conducted to rule out any effects of the synaptotagmin-I-knockout on

conserved set of five acidic amino-acid side chains, with contributions made by other residues (FIG. 2). In synaptotagmin I, the intrinsic affinity for Ca²⁺ is low, with $K_{d}$ values of ~60 µM, 400 µM and >1 mM for C2A (REF.34) and ~300–600 µM for C2B (REF.28). However, the affinity for Ca²⁺ can be strongly affected by the presence of synaptotagmin-binding partners, which is discussed in detail below.

Synaptotagmins can homo- and hetero-oligomerize, and seem to function *in vivo* as oligomeric complexes³⁵,³⁶. Ca²⁺-independent oligomerization is mediated by determinants in the amino-terminal domain²⁵,³⁷⁻⁴⁰, whereas Ca²⁺-dependent oligomerization is mediated by the cytoplasmic domain⁴¹⁻⁴⁸. It should be noted that Ca²⁺-triggered oligomerization of the recombinant cytoplasmic domain, or isolated C2B-domains, was not observed in some studies, which might be due to the removal of a contaminant that is known to bind tightly to C2B (REFS 49,50). The fact that native synaptotagmins undergo Ca²⁺-dependent oligomerization (for example, REF.45) indicates that *in situ* cellular factors might mediate this property. Disruption of Ca²⁺-triggered oligomerization activity reduces secretion, which indicates that this property serves as a coupling step in exocytosis⁴¹,⁵¹. At present, the stoichiometry and structure of the oligomers is unclear. It has been speculated that synaptotagmins might form collar- or ring-like structures⁴¹,⁵¹, and that Ca²⁺-driven rearrangements of these structures might regulate fusion-pore dynamics⁵², for example, by dilating the neck of a fusion pore in a Ca²⁺-regulated manner. The C2

Box 2 | What is a C2 domain?

C2 is an abbreviation for the second constant sequence that is found in ‘classical’ protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms that require Ca²⁺ for activity. These isoforms bind to membranes in response to Ca²⁺, which prompted the idea that the C2 sequence forms a Ca²⁺-dependent membrane-binding module¹²⁶. Several other proteins — including **cytosolic phospholipase A2** (cPLA₂) and synaptotagmin — were found to contain C2-homologous sequences, which are now known to form autonomously folding domains and are hence referred to as C2 domains²⁷. The first experimental evidence that indicated that C2 motifs might encode Ca²⁺-activated lipid-binding domains was obtained for cPLA₂ (REF. 127). A 16-kDa proteolytic fragment of this enzyme, which corresponds to its lone C2 domain, translocated to native membranes in response to Ca²⁺. The first direct demonstration of Ca²⁺-triggered C2-domain–lipid-bilayer interactions was carried out using the isolated recombinant C2A domain of synaptotagmin, which bound to artificial liposomes that contained anionic phospholipids in response to Ca²⁺ (REFS 24,103).

Since the initial cloning of PKC isoforms, 123 C2 domains have been found in the human genome, which makes them the 24th most common motif¹²⁸. It is clear that not all C2 domains are Ca²⁺-binding motifs — they might have lost this function as they have become specialized for other tasks. For example, some C2 domains from synaptotagmins lack the Ca²⁺ ligands that are crucial for Ca²⁺ binding, and are therefore unlikely to function as Ca²⁺-binding modules²³,⁹⁹. Precedent for this comes from studies of the most common Ca²⁺-binding motif in biology — the EF-HAND¹²⁹. Around one-third of EF-hands seem to have lost their Ca²⁺-binding activity.

fusion rates³⁶,⁶⁹ shows that synaptotagmins are not required for fusion *per se*, but that they probably function as regulatory proteins.

**Effect on fusion-pore dynamics in exocytosis.** Time-resolved studies of LDCV fusion in PC12 cells indicate that synaptotagmins regulate the final steps in exocytosis. In this secretory event, Ca²⁺ drives the abrupt opening of fusion pores that often ‘wait’ before dilating, which gives rise to a large spike of catecholamine release. This waiting period is recognized as a small, steady trickle of catecholamine release, and has been called a pre-spike foot. The goal of these studies was to perturb synaptotagmin expression and assay for effects on pre-spike-foot kinetics. Perturbation was carried out using synaptotagmin IV, which is upregulated in response to seizures⁷². Increases in synaptotagmin IV expression reduces the rate of exocytosis⁵²,⁷⁰, perhaps owing to the weak Ca²⁺-binding properties of its C2A domain⁷³. So, synaptotagmins can determine, in part, the time-to-opening of fusion pores. A crucial finding was that upregulation of synaptotagmin IV also reduces the mean lifetime of the pre-spike foot, which indicates that synaptotagmin IV destabilizes the open state of fusion pores. By contrast, overexpression of synaptotagmin I increases the mean lifetime of the pre-spike foot, and might stabilize fusion pores⁵². Although it cannot be ruled out that synaptotagmins influence an earlier step that is manifested later (during the opening and dilation of fusion pores), the simplest interpretation of these data is that synaptotagmins directly interact with the fusion apparatus (potentially lipids, SNAREs and/or other copies of synaptotagmin; as described below) to influence its kinetic properties.

**A role in endocytosis.** Synaptotagmin-I-null mutant strains, and mutations that delete the C2B domain of the protein, lead to defects in SV recycling in both flies and worms⁵¹,⁷⁴. Indeed, biochemical studies established that the C2B domain interacts with several molecules that are involved in endocytosis (recently reviewed in REFS 75,76). A current model for synaptotagmin I function during endocytosis is that it synergizes with tyrosine-based motifs to recruit the adaptor protein complex AP-2 (REF.77). Synaptotagmin I also binds with high affinity to the plasma-membrane lipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P₂)⁷⁸⁻⁸⁰. After exocytosis, synaptotagmin might act as a PtdIns(4,5)P₂ ‘sink’ to increase the PtdIns(4,5)P₂ density in the patch of vesicle membrane to be endocytosed. Like synaptotagmin I, PtdIns(4,5)P₂ binds directly to the adaptor protein complex AP-2, and recruits it to sites of endocytosis. AP-2, in turn, mediates the assembly of clathrin coats onto the fused vesicle membrane⁷⁵,⁷⁶. This coat deforms the membrane into a vesicle that is pinched off from the plasma membrane to complete endocytosis. Soluble proteins, called StonedA and StonedB, which were first identified as products of the *stoned* locus in *Drosophila*, might help to mediate uncoating by binding to the C2B domain of synaptotagmin I to drive the release of AP-2 (REFS 81–83). Recent support for a role of synaptotagmin

INTRAGENIC COMPLEMENTATION  
A situation in which a heterozygote carrying two different mutations that affect the same polypeptide has a phenotype that is closer to the wild-type than that of either of the respective homozygotes. In most cases, this results from effects on subunit interactions in multimeric proteins.

The role of the C2A domain. Using site-directed fluorescent reporters, the region of C2A that directly interacts with membranes was mapped^{37,89,90} and was found to correspond to the two flexible loops — 1 and 3 — that form the Ca²⁺-binding sites in C2A. The distal tips of these loops penetrate one-sixth of the way into the hydrophobic core of lipid bilayers (FIG.3a). The overall interaction is electrostatic, as evidenced by the high sensitivity of binding to ionic strength^{89,91}, and positively charged residues in the loops are likely to form ionic bonds with the polar head groups of anionic lipids, which might, in turn, provide more Ca²⁺ ligands to complete the Ca²⁺-binding sites. In this view, the Ca²⁺-binding sites are incomplete in the absence of membranes. This model explains why many C2 domains bind Ca²⁺ more tightly in the presence, rather than the absence, of membranes^{25,90,92}, and also helps to explain the specificity of C2-domain–membrane interactions. Charged residues on the Ca²⁺/membrane-binding loops probably determine whether C2 domains prefer anionic lipids (for example, synaptotagmin which binds tightly to phosphatidylserine (PS)) or ZWITTERIONIC LIPIDS with a net neutral charge (for example, cytosolic phospholipase A2, which binds tightly to phosphatidylcholine).

The role of the C2B domain. In contrast to the C2A domain, the isolated C2B domain of synaptotagmin shows only low levels of Ca²⁺-triggered PS binding activity and does not penetrate membranes to any significant degree^{28,78,93}. PS is the main anionic phospholipid in membranes and is likely to be a physiologically relevant target for the action of Ca²⁺-bound synaptotagmin I. Surprisingly, when C2B is tethered next to C2A, C2B binds tightly to vesicles that contain PS, and its Ca²⁺-binding loops penetrate the bilayer in a manner that is analogous to C2A. The activation of C2B does not require the Ca²⁺/membrane-binding activity in C2A, which shows a new form of cooperativity between tandem C2 domains^{85}. A key finding was that membrane-binding activity is to some degree ‘redundant’, as complete disruption of this activity requires Ca²⁺-ligand mutations on both C2 domains^{93} — a finding that we will return to later.

Ca²⁺ requirements for synaptotagmin–membrane interactions. A frequently asked question is whether the Ca²⁺ requirements for synaptotagmin–membrane interactions occur at Ca²⁺ concentrations that drive secretion? This is not a straightforward issue, as the Ca²⁺ dependence for exocytosis seems to range from ~10–200 μM Ca²⁺, depending on the nerve terminal that is under study^{94–96}. These differences could be due to the distinct properties of the Ca²⁺ sensors that are expressed in various synapses, which is an issue that has yet to be explored in any detail (BOX 3). The Ca²⁺ dependence of synaptotagmin–membrane interactions is strongly dependent on the composition of the liposomes; increases in the anionic lipid content reduce the Ca²⁺ requirements for binding^{25}. This is probably a surface effect in which increasing the negative charge density on the liposome increases the

in endocytosis has also been obtained in studies of endocytosis using fibroblasts that were transfected with synaptotagmin constructs^{33,38}.

**Synaptotagmin I: a membrane-binding machine**

If synaptotagmin I is a Ca²⁺ sensor that triggers release, this effect must be mediated by Ca²⁺ occupancy of its C2 domains and the resultant changes in interactions with effector molecules. In some cases, the function of C2 domains is clear — they mediate the Ca²⁺-triggered translocation of some enzymes to membranes where their catalytic domains can interact with membrane-delimited substrates, which enhances the overall rate of catalysis. Borrowing this theme, Ca²⁺ might trigger the interaction of the C2 domains of synaptotagmin I with the target membrane, ‘pulling’ the bilayers together to facilitate fusion either by proximity^{84–86} or by direct juxtaposition of SNARE proteins to allow their rapid assembly^{87,88}.

ZWITTERIONIC LIPIDS  
Lipids that carry both positive and negative charges.

synaptotagmin–membrane interactions lies in the nanomolar range, which is amongst the highest affinity synaptotagmin–effector interaction that has been reported so far<sup>85</sup>.

Cis or trans? Do the C2 domains of synaptotagmin penetrate into the vesicle (cis) or the plasma membrane (trans) during exocytosis? Either interaction can occur<sup>37</sup>, which indicates that other factors steer synaptotagmin towards the appropriate target membrane. A leading candidate to fulfil this function is PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>. As noted above, PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> binds tightly to the C2B domain of synaptotagmin<sup>78</sup>, and is selectively localized to the plasma membrane of neurons and neurosecretory cells<sup>79,80</sup>. Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent synaptotagmin–PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> binding would predispose the C2 domains to penetrate into the plasma membrane in response to Ca<sup>2+</sup>. This model is supported by the findings that inositol 1,2,3,4,5,6-hexakisphosphate blocks synaptotagmin–PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> interactions<sup>78</sup> and that a related molecule, inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate, seems to block exocytosis by binding to the C2B domain of synaptotagmin *in vivo*<sup>55</sup>. This model awaits further experimental verification, but it is intriguing given the established requirement for PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> in several intracellular fusion events, including Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered exocytosis<sup>102</sup> (FIGS 3b, 4).

Do synaptotagmin–membrane interactions function in secretion? An optical reporter placed at position 234 in the C2A domain of synaptotagmin I, which is in the distal tip of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding loop 3, directly penetrates into membranes<sup>37,89,90</sup> (FIG. 3a). Next to this residue lies an arginine (FIG. 2) that is likely to interact directly with the anionic phospholipid head groups that are preferred by synaptotagmin<sup>24,103</sup>. As expected, neutralization of this residue by an Arg233Gln mutation reduced Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered binding to membranes<sup>104</sup>, which is probably secondary to a loss of affinity for membranes. In mice, this mutation resulted in a twofold decrease in evoked secretion<sup>104</sup>. However, in studies that use viruses to insert mutant synaptotagmins back into hippocampal neurons from synaptotagmin-knockout mice, mutations that are predicted to completely disrupt Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered C2A domain–membrane interactions are able to rescue fast synaptic transmission (J. Sullivan and C. Stevens, personal communication). This finding might be due to the redundancy of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered lipid-binding activity of C2A and C2B (REFS 85,93). By contrast, a mutation that disrupts the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensing ability of the C2B domain, without affecting Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent effector interactions, resulted in a strong post-docking defect in exocytosis<sup>51,105</sup>. These studies indicate that the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensing ability of C2B is more crucial for exocytosis than the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensing ability of C2A. This is not unexpected, as Ca<sup>2+</sup> regulates more C2B–effector interactions than it does for C2A, including interactions with PS<sup>85</sup>, PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> (REF.78), the polytopic SV protein **SV2** (REF 106) and other copies of synaptotagmin<sup>41–44,48,105</sup>. Also, no known overall function of synaptotagmin is abolished by mutations that are confined to the C2A domain.

Box 3 | The function/localization of other synaptotagmin isoforms

Ca²⁺ might be a general requirement for all intracellular membrane-fusion events<sup>86</sup>. In yeast, which apparently lack synaptotagmins, the Ca²⁺ sensor for intracellular membrane fusion might be **calmodulin**<sup>86</sup>. As calmodulin does not seem to be a Ca²⁺ sensor for exocytosis from neurons or neuroendocrine cells<sup>130–132</sup> (see also REF. 133), and all evidence so far is consistent with a role for synaptotagmin I in this process, it is possible that other, more widely expressed synaptotagmin isoforms regulate membrane transport in other cell types and transport steps. It should also be noted that in all cases in which synaptotagmin I has been knocked out, some level of Ca²⁺-triggered exocytosis persists, which shows that if synaptotagmin I is a Ca²⁺ sensor for neuronal exocytosis, it certainly is not the only one. Residual release might be regulated by other isoforms of the protein.

The first step in addressing these questions requires the unambiguous determination of the tissue distribution of synaptotagmins, as well as their subcellular localizations. It is firmly established that synaptotagmin I and II are localized to secretory vesicles in neurons and neuroendocrine cells, but unambiguous data that concern all of the other isoforms are not yet available. We highlight this issue using two examples. **Synaptotagmin III** has been reported to be present on synaptic vesicles in some studies<sup>100</sup> and on the plasma membrane in other studies<sup>134</sup>. Recently, synaptotagmin III and **synaptotagmin VII** have been proposed to function as plasma-membrane Ca²⁺ sensors for secretion from PC12 cells<sup>101,132</sup>. However, immunoblot studies indicate that neither isoform is expressed at detectable levels in PC12 cells<sup>117</sup>; the only isoforms that were expressed in these cells at any significant level were synaptotagmin I and synaptotagmin IX (and low levels of synaptotagmin IV), which seem to function in a largely redundant manner<sup>117,135,136</sup>. In other studies, using antibodies as well as green-fluorescent-protein tagged proteins, synaptotagmin VII was localized to lysosomes in a kidney cell line, where it might regulate lysosomal exocytosis<sup>137</sup>. Future studies, using independent antibodies and epitope-tagged proteins are required to resolve this crucial distribution/subcellular localization issue.

The SNARE connection. Syntaxin was identified as one of a few proteins that co-immunoprecipitate with synaptotagmin from rat brain detergent extracts<sup>107</sup>. Immunoprecipitation studies of syntaxin yielded similar results — the only associated proteins were synaptotagmin and other SNARE proteins<sup>108</sup>. These data establish the specificity of synaptotagmin–target-membrane-associated (t)-SNARE interactions and provide a compelling biochemical bridge between the putative Ca²⁺ sensor and the fusion apparatus. Subsequent studies, which largely used recombinant cytoplasmic domains of these proteins, showed Ca²⁺-promoted direct stoichiometric interactions between synaptotagmin and both of the t-SNAREs, syntaxin and SNAP-25 (REFS 30,51,109–111; see also REFS 112,113). Synaptotagmin binds to isolated t-SNAREs, t-SNARE heterodimers and t-SNAREs that are completely assembled into SNARE complexes. Binding occurs at the ‘base’ of t-SNAREs (near the membrane anchors), in the region that assembles into SNARE complexes<sup>109,111,114,115</sup>. This binding site places synaptotagmin in an ideal position to regulate SNARE function and, perhaps, SNARE assembly.

Studies in PC12 cells indicate that SNAP-25 does not assemble into a complex to drive fusion until arrival of the Ca²⁺ signal<sup>87</sup>, and reconstitution of Ca²⁺-triggered fusion using SVs and liposomes that contain purified t-SNAREs showed that SNARE complexes do not form unless Ca²⁺-triggered fusion is allowed to proceed<sup>88</sup>. Furthermore, an anti-SNAP-25 antibody that blocks SNARE-complex assembly abolishes the fastest component of exocytosis from chromaffin cells, which indicates that complex assembly is closely correlated with fusion<sup>116</sup>.

These studies support a model in which Ca²⁺ acts by driving assembly of SNARE complexes, which in turn drive membrane fusion. In this light, it is interesting to note that mutations in *Drosophila* synaptotagmin can prevent the assembly of SNARE complexes *in vivo*<sup>51</sup>, although mutations in other genes can have similar effects<sup>106</sup>. Although this is a speculative model, there are indications that synaptotagmin–SNARE interactions function during exocytosis. In particular, alterations in the carboxyl terminus of SNAP-25, which selectively reduce synaptotagmin binding, result in diminished exocytosis<sup>111,117</sup>, and reagents that block native synaptotagmin–SNARE-complex interactions rapidly block secretion<sup>93</sup>. Further functional analysis of these interactions would be helped by a detailed understanding of how binding occurs.

Nuclear magnetic resonance studies have attempted to map the interface between the C2A domain of synaptotagmin and syntaxin. However, these studies used the amino-terminal domain of syntaxin (Habc domain)<sup>34,118,119</sup>, which is completely dispensable for binding<sup>109,114,115</sup>. Furthermore, high-affinity binding requires the presence of both C2 domains of synaptotagmin I (REFS 43,90). The kinetics of these interactions, and the precise interfaces that mediate assembly, have yet to be determined. Also, the Ca²⁺ requirements for binding are not well established. *In vitro* studies indicate that binding occurs in the 100–200 μM Ca²⁺ range<sup>109,111</sup>, but crosslinking studies in permeabilized PC12 cells indicate that binding is largely complete at 10 μM Ca²⁺ (REF. 117), perhaps due to the ability of membranes to increase the affinity of synaptotagmin for Ca²⁺, as described above.

Models of synaptotagmin action during exocytosis. A summary of these interactions is given in the model shown in FIG. 3b and FIG. 4. The mechanism of bilayer merger is not yet understood in any system, and many models have been proposed (for reviews, see REFS 84,86,120). The model that is depicted in FIG. 3b and FIG. 4 is a combination of the ‘proximity model’ in which the fusion pore is purely lipidic, and the ‘fusion-pore

Figure 4 | A model for synaptotagmin function during exocytosis. A cutaway view of the putative fusion ‘machine’, which is composed of synaptotagmin, SNAREs (synaptobrevin, syntaxin and SNAP-25) and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P₂), is shown. Other factors clearly have roles in exocytosis but are not considered here¹. The fusion pore might be composed of phospholipids, the membrane anchors of the SNARE proteins, or a combination of both. See text for details.

model’ in which the fusion pore is composed of a ring of protein that expands to allow lipid into its circumference. A cutaway view of a putative fusion machine — composed of synaptotagmin, SNAREs and PtdIns(4,5)P₂ — is shown. Other factors clearly have roles in exocytosis but are not considered here¹.

In the absence of Ca²⁺, this ‘machine’ weakly pre-assembles into a ring-like structure at the interface between the membranes that are destined to fuse⁸⁴. In response to Ca²⁺, we propose that three things occur: synaptotagmin tightly oligomerizes; the Ca²⁺-binding loops of its C2 domains penetrate into PtdIns(4,5)P₂ rafts in the plasma membrane; and synaptotagmin and/or other factors drive complete assembly of trans-SNARE complexes (FIG. 4). Synaptotagmin–membrane interactions, and, in parallel, the SNARE complex, bring the membranes into close proximity, such that, in the centre of the ring, the hydration barrier at the surface of the membranes is overcome and the membranes touch. This might result in a hemifusion intermediate (FIG. 4), in which the outer leaflets merge and the inner leaflet forms a single bilayer, as indicated by studies of viral fusion proteins¹²¹. If lipid flux is not allowed into this site of contact (the ‘hemifusion diaphragm’) and the ring is triggered to expand, the lateral tension would destabilize the region of contact, and favour fusion. Further expansion of the pore would result in collapse of the vesicle membrane into the plasma membrane, where it would be subsequently retrieved by endocytosis. At least some of these expansion steps might be regulated by synaptotagmin⁵² and also by the curvature of the vesicle, which provides some driving force for fusion.

Another interpretation of this model is that synaptotagmin, through its Ca²⁺-independent mode of binding to t-SNAREs, blocks SNARE assembly before the Ca²⁺ signal, which potentially inhibits spontaneous fusion *in vivo*³⁶,⁶⁹,⁷⁰. Then, in response to Ca²⁺, it could change its mode of interaction with t-SNAREs to facilitate SNARE-complex assembly. Studies using cytoplasmic fragments of synaptotagmin and SNAREs have so far yielded only a modest enhancement of SNARE-complex assembly⁵¹, but such effects might become apparent using full-length proteins that are reconstituted into proteoliposomes, as the full-length proteins show markedly different biochemical properties¹²².

In a final interpretation, Ca²⁺-bound synaptotagmin could act on SNARE complexes after they have assembled. Biochemical evidence indicates that synaptotagmin can both penetrate membranes and bind to the core of the SNARE complex at the same time⁹⁰. In this view, synaptotagmin might twist the complex, to further pull the bilayers together. There could be an interesting parallel in yeast vacuole-membrane fusion, in which the PX-domain of the t-SNARE Vam7 must bind phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate for vacuolar-membrane fusion to occur (C. Ungermann, personal communication). So, in the vacuolar SNARE complex, the lipid-binding motif is built into one of the SNARE proteins. In the case of neuronal exocytosis, the C2 domains of synaptotagmin might fulfil this role. None of these models are mutually exclusive and aspects of each model might operate concurrently.

Future directions — reconstitution

Genetic manipulations, using precisely defined loss-of-function mutations, should uncover further insights into the post-docking function of discrete synaptotagmin–effector interactions ${}^{104,123}$. However, directly addressing whether synaptotagmin is a Ca${}^{2+}$ sensor that triggers fusion is likely to require a reconstituted system using defined components. If the only Ca${}^{2+}$-binding sites in a functional reconstituted system were in synaptotagmin, then we would be able to conclude that synaptotagmin must be part of the Ca${}^{2+}$-sensing apparatus. For example, the *in vitro* fusion assay that is described by Weber *et al.* ${}^{15}$ could be used to ask whether synaptotagmin is all that is needed to confer Ca${}^{2+}$ regulation on SNARE-mediated membrane fusion.

Although this is probably a bit too optimistic, further promise is provided by a recent report from Hu *et al.* ${}^{88}$. In their study, they were able to reconstitute the Ca${}^{2+}$-triggered fusion of SVs (which have on their membrane native synaptotagmin, as well as synaptobrevin and numerous other proteins) with proteoliposomes that contain only purified t-SNAREs. If the SVs can withstand solubilization and reconstitution, this system might provide a means to subtract and add back integral membrane proteins ${}^{124}$, including synaptotagmin. This could potentially make it possible to determine unequivocally whether synaptotagmin is a Ca${}^{2+}$ sensor that triggers exocytosis, and would provide a reduced system to define the precise mode of action of synaptotagmin.
