Parathyroid hormone (PTH) increases FGF23 mRNA and protein levels *in vivo* and *in vitro*. Here we tested whether the increased FGF23 expression by PTH is mediated by the orphan nuclear receptor Nurr1. PTH increased Nurr1 mRNA levels prior to elevation of FGF23 mRNA levels in UMR-106 rat osteoblast-like cells. Activation of PKA increased both FGF23 and Nurr1 mRNA levels. Modification of Nurr1 expression showed that Nurr1 is essential for the PTH-mediated increase in FGF23 and luciferase reporter gene experiments identified a functional promoter region containing several potential Nurr1 binding sites. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays confirmed the binding of Nurr1 to these regions in the FGF23 promoter. *In vivo*, Nurr1 mRNA and protein levels were increased in calvaria from rats with experimental CKD together with high PTH and FGF23 expression. Calcimimetics decrease PTH and FGF23 levels in CKD patients. Importantly, in rats with experimental CKD, the calcimimetic R568 decreased PTH expression, calvaria Nurr1 mRNA and protein levels, and FGF23 mRNA. Immunohistochemistry for Nurr1 showed an increase in the number of Nurr1 expressing osteocytes in the femurs of rats with CKD and this was decreased by R568. Thus, the effect of PTH to increase FGF23 transcription is mediated by Nurr1 *in vitro* and *in vivo*. In CKD, calcimimetics decrease PTH, which in turn decreases Nurr1 and consequently FGF23.

Osteocytes and osteoblasts synthesize and secrete FGF23, which acts on its receptor complex klotho-FGFR1 in its target organs, the renal tubules and the parathyroid. ${}^{1}$ In the kidney, FGF23 inhibits the phosphate transporters, NaPi2a and NaPi2c, resulting in a phosphaturia and decreased serum phosphate. ${}^{2}$ In addition, FGF23 inhibits the renal CYP27B1, which codes for the 25(OH)vitamin D 1α(OH)ase, leading to a decrease in serum 1,25(OH)₂ vitamin D levels. ${}^{3,4}$ In the parathyroid, FGF23 decreases parathyroid hormone (PTH) gene expression and hence serum PTH levels. ${}^{5,6}$ In chronic kidney disease (CKD), in patients and experimental models, there is a downregulation of the FGF23 receptor complex klotho-FGFR1 in the parathyroid, resulting in resistance of the parathyroid to FGF23. ${}^{7-9}$ This resistance contributes to the high levels of both PTH and FGF23 in CKD. PTH acts on bone by inducing the phosphorylation of its receptor PTH1R and activates both the protein kinase A (PKA) and Wnt pathways. ${}^{10,11}$ The logarithmic increases in serum FGF23 levels in CKD are associated with an increased mortality in these patients. ${}^{12,13}$ A major factor causing the high levels of FGF23 is the secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHP) of CKD. ${}^{14}$ A calcimimetic given to dialysis patients to decrease their serum PTH levels led to decreased serum FGF23 levels. ${}^{15}$ *In vivo*, in rats with short-term adenine-induced renal failure, parathyroidectomy both prevented and corrected the increased serum FGF23 levels. ${}^{14}$ Moreover, *in vitro* in rat osteoblast-like UMR106 cells, PTH increased FGF23 mRNA levels through both the PKA and Wnt pathways. ${}^{14}$ Therefore, PTH is trophic to FGF23 *in vivo* and *in vitro*.

The nuclear orphan receptor, nuclear receptor-associated protein1 (Nurr1), is a ligand-independent nuclear receptor because it has no cavity for ligand binding and no ligand has been identified. ${}^{16}$ Nurr1 is a member of the nerve growth factor-inducible factor B (NR4A; NGFIB) family. The NR4A family is composed of three members: Nurr1, Nurr77, and NOR-1. ${}^{17}$ Nurr1 is a target for PTH in MC3T3-E1 preosteoblastic cells with the time response of an early-response gene. ${}^{18-20}$ PTH induces NR4A members through the cAMP-PKA pathway *in vitro*. ${}^{18}$ PTH rapidly and transiently induced expression of all three NR4A genes in PTH-target tissues, calvaria, long bones, and kidneys *in vivo*. ${}^{21}$ In bone, PTH

stimulates Nurr1 to increase osteopontin and osteocalcin gene expression both in vivo and in vitro.¹⁸,²¹ Nurr1 binds and transactivates target promoters by binding to cis elements as a monomer, homodimer, or Nurr1-RXR heterodimer. As a monomer, Nurr1 binds to an extended hormone response element referred to as an NGFI-B response element (NBRE).¹⁶,²²,²³ The major described functions for Nurr1 are its role in the CNS where it is essential for the development and maintenance of dopaminergic neurons and is of interest as to a possible role in the development of Parkinsonism.²⁴,²⁵ We now report that PTH increases Nurr1 mRNA levels, which precede the increase in FGF23 mRNA levels in UMR106 cells. We identified Nurr1 response elements in the FGF23 promoter by bioinformatics, reporter assays, and chromatin immunoprecipitation (CHIP) analysis. Nurr1 overexpression and knock down by shRNA demonstrated that Nurr1 is essential for the increase in FGF23 by PTH. In vivo, in CKD rat calvaria Nurr1 mRNA and protein levels were increased, together with their high FGF23 mRNA levels. Calcimimetic administration decreased PTH and FGF23 levels and calvaria Nurr1 mRNA and protein levels.

RESULTS

PTH increases Nurr1 and then FGF23 expression

To study the role of Nurr1 in the PTH-induced elevation of FGF23 in bone cells, we exposed rat osteoblast-like UMR-106 cells to PTH and measured FGF23 and Nurr1 mRNA levels

using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) (Figure 1a and b). As previously shown,¹⁴ FGF23 mRNA levels were significantly increased at 6 h after exposure to PTH 1–34, which was maintained at 24 h (Figure 1a). Nurr1 mRNA levels were increased already at 30 min, reaching a peak at 1 h and rapidly decreasing back to basal levels at 6 h (Figure 1b). This rapid increase in Nurr1 is compatible with the function of Nurr1 as an immediate early response gene.¹⁸ Of interest, the addition of 1,25(OH)₂ vitamin D₃ also increased Nurr1 mRNA at 1 h together with the expected increase in FGF23 at 5–21 h (Supplementary Figure S1).

PTH acts on UMR106 cells and primary mouse osteoblasts through activation of PKA.¹⁴,¹⁸ We therefore studied the effect of PKA activation by forskolin on Nurr1 gene expression. PTH and forskolin both increased FGF23 mRNA levels as before¹⁴ and also increased Nurr1 mRNA levels (Figure 1c). To study whether Nurr1 has an independent effect on FGF23 expression, we overexpressed Nurr1 by transient transfection in UMR106 cells. Nurr1 overexpression increased FGF23 mRNA levels in the absence of PTH (Figure 1d).

PTH increases Nurr1 and FGF23 gene transcription and FGF23 promoter activity

To study whether the PTH-induced increase in Nurr1 and FGF23 levels was a transcriptional effect, we added actino-mycin D to the cells together with the addition of PTH or vehicle. Actinomycin D prevented the increase in both FGF23

and Nurr1 mRNA levels. Therefore, the effect of PTH on FGF23 and Nurr1 expression is transcription dependent (Figure 2a and b). We used an 8-kb FGF23 promoter firefly luciferase reporter plasmid²⁶ to study FGF23 promoter activity (Figure 2). UMR106 cells were transiently transfected with the 8-kb FGF23 promoter firefly luciferase plasmid. PTH (1–34) but not PTH (3–34) increased promoter activity 2.5-fold (Figure 2c and d). Co-transfection of the 8-kb FGF23 promoter luciferase plasmid together with the Nurr1 expression plasmid increased FGF23 promoter activity even without the addition of PTH (Figure 2d). Nurr1 overexpression did not amplify the effect of PTH on FGF23 promoter activity, suggesting that the PTH-enhanced endogenous Nurr1 was sufficient for PTH action on the FGF23 promoter (Figure 2d). Therefore, PTH increases Nurr1, which acts on the FGF23 promoter to increase FGF23 transcription.

Knockdown of Nurr1 by shRNA abrogated the PTH-induced increase in FGF23

We then studied whether Nurr1 is essential for increased FGF23 expression by PTH. We decreased Nurr1 protein levels using shRNAs targeting Nurr1. We assessed the resulting effects of Nurr1 knockdown on the PTH-induced increase in FGF23 mRNA levels. Nurr1 depletion did not affect basal FGF23 expression but abolished the increase in endogenous FGF23 expression by PTH (Figure 3). In addition, Nurr1 knockdown prevented the effect of PTH to increase FGF23 promoter activity (Figure 3b). Therefore, Nurr1 is essential for the enhanced transcription of FGF23 by PTH.

Mapping the PTH response region in the FGF23 promoter

To identify experimentally the regions in the FGF23 promoter that mediate the effect of PTH to increase FGF23 transcription, we used the firefly luciferase construct driven by the 8-kb FGF23 promoter as in Figure 2 and shorter fragments (Figure 4a). Deletion of the proximal half of the 8-kb promoter abrogated the effect of PTH on the FGF23 promoter activity (Figure 4a). Constructs containing the proximal 1275 or just 550 bp of the promoter were sufficient to restore the response to PTH (Figure 4a). Nurr1 overexpression also increased FGF23 promoter activity, which was enhanced by the addition of PTH (1–34) but not more than the effect of PTH itself (Figure 4b), as was shown for endogenous FGF23 (Figure 2d). Our results show that the proximal 550 base pairs of the FGF23 promoter are sufficient for the increase in FGF23 promoter activity after the addition of PTH or after Nurr1 overexpression.

programs Clover<sup>27</sup> and ORCA<sup>28</sup> to examine the DNA sequence 8 kb upstream to 100 bp downstream from the FGF23 transcriptional start site for the presence of NBREs. Each program yielded slightly different results, with the most potential NRBEs and sequence conservation between species identified in the proximal promoter of ~1000 bp. Analysis of the proximal 650-bp sequence revealed a number of putative NRBEs that are evolutionarily preserved in humans, mice, and rats, suggesting their potential biological significance (Figure 4c). These findings together with our functional analyses further support our hypothesis that Nurr1 mediates the regulation of FGF23 transcription by PTH.

Nurr1 protein binds the FGF23 promoter

We performed CHIP assays to demonstrate a physical association of Nurr1 with the NBREs in the FGF23 promoter. The CHIP study was conducted in UMR106 cells without the addition of PTH. DNA was immunoprecipitated from UMR-106 cell lysates using anti-Nurr1 antibodies and analyzed by qRT-PCR using primers designed to identify the segments of DNAs containing the predicted NBREs in the FGF23 promoter. There was a significant association of Nurr1 to the NBRE-containing DNA fragments located in the FGF23 proximal promoter 1000-bp region compared with the binding of Nurr1 to a fragment located downstream in the transcribed sequences of the FGF23 gene (Figure 5). These results show that Nurr1 binds to the FGF23 promoter in UMR106 cells even in the absence of PTH.

Increased Nurr1 mRNA and protein levels in the bone of CKD rats are prevented by the calcimimetic R568

The physiological relevance of Nurr1 to FGF23 expression was studied by measuring Nurr1 in calvaria of rats with experimental kidney failure. Rats were fed an adenine high-phosphorus diet for 14 days to induce renal failure and SHP.<sup>29</sup> The diet led to increased serum creatinine, phosphate, and PTH, and decreased serum calcium (Table 1). Both FGF23 and Nurr1 mRNA levels were increased in calvaria from uremic rats, suggesting that the high PTH of SHP induces Nurr1 to increase FGF23 expression also in vivo (Figure 6a). We then studied the effect of a calcimimetic that decreases serum PTH on FGF23 and Nurr1 expression.<sup>29</sup> R568 decreased serum PTH as expected (Table 1). In addition, R568 injected daily also decreased calvaria FGF23 mRNA levels (Figure 6a). Importantly, administration of the calcimimetic led to a decrease in calvaria Nurr1 mRNA and protein levels (Figure 6a-c). Immunohistochemistry of bone from control rats showed the expression of Nurr1 in osteocytes (Figure 6d). The expression of Nurr1 was increased in the bones of rats with adenine-induced uremia (Figure 6d). Uremic rats injected daily with the calcimimetic R568 had a marked decrease in the number of Nurr1-expressing osteocytes (Figure 6d). Together, these results show that calvaria Nurr1 levels are increased in experimental CKD together with the high serum PTH and bone FGF23 expression. Decreasing PTH by a calcimimetic decreases calvaria Nurr1 expression, as well as FGF23 expression. The results show that PTH acts on bone to induce Nurr1 and suggest that Nurr1 then leads to the increase in FGF23 expression.

DISCUSSION

As CKD progresses, there is a progressive increase in serum FGF23 levels, which may reach exceptionally high levels.<sup>30,31</sup> The high levels of FGF23 are associated with an increased mortality in patients with CKD.<sup>13</sup> There is therefore great interest in determining the major factors and mechanisms that increase FGF23 expression. We have previously shown that SHP is essential for the high FGF23 levels of CKD, as parathyroidectomy both prevents and corrects the high FGF23 levels of experimental renal failure.<sup>14</sup> Similarly, in dialysis patients, decreasing serum PTH by a calcimimetic decreases serum FGF23 levels.<sup>15</sup> PTH infusion to mice and humans increases serum FGF23, and PTH added to UMR106 cells leads to an increased expression of FGF23.<sup>14,32</sup> The effect of PTH on FGF23 is mediated by both the PKA and Wnt

pathways, but the mechanism is not known.¹⁴ In another bone-derived cell line, ROS 17/2.8, added PTH had no effect on FGF23 levels despite the expected increase after 1,25(OH)₂ vitamin D.³³

PTH increases the expression of Nurr1 in bone cells, as well as *in vivo* in rodents injected with PTH.¹⁸ The effect of PTH and Nurr1 overexpression is mediated by NBREs located in the promoter of its target genes, as reported for the osteocalcin gene promoter.²⁰ We now show that PTH increases Nurr1 mRNA levels in osteoblast-like UMR106 cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Nurr1 acts as an early response gene in the cascade of activation of FGF23 transcription by PTH. After exposure to PTH, UMR106 cells increase Nurr1 expression before the increase in FGF23. Nurr1 overexpression increases FGF23 mRNA levels also in the absence of PTH, underlining the role of Nurr1 in FGF23 expression. PTH increased Nurr1 through activation of the PKA pathway. Stimulation of PKA by forskolin increased

Nurr1 and FGF23 mRNA levels. Tetradis *et al.* showed that PTH induction of Nurr1 in primary mouse osteoblasts is mediated primarily through the cAMP/PKA pathway. In mouse osteoblast cells, prolonged treatment with phorbol esters, which downregulates PKC activity, did not affect the PTH induction of Nurr1.¹⁸ Others have also shown that PTH primarily acts through the PKA pathway on bone.³⁴,³⁵ Overexpression of Nurr1 did not amplify the response of FGF23 expression and promoter activity to PTH. This suggests that the increase in endogenous Nurr1 by PTH is sufficient for maximal induction of FGF23. Importantly, Nurr1 knockdown by shRNA prevented the increase in FGF23 by PTH. Therefore, Nurr1 is necessary for the action of PTH to increase FGF23 expression in bone cells.

We show that PTH increases FGF23 gene transcription and identified a functional region of 550 bp in the proximal mouse promoter that mediated the increase in the FGF23 promoter activity by PTH. This region contains three

Therefore, the effect of acute kidney injury on FGF23 expression is mediated by factors other than PTH in these mouse models.<sup>38</sup> There are many other factors that contribute to the high levels of FGF23 in CKD.<sup>39</sup> These include metabolic acidosis and calcium, calcitriol, and iron treatment of CKD patients.<sup>40-45</sup> The effect of PTH to increase serum calcitriol would also contribute to the effect of PTH on serum FGF23 levels. Calcitriol increases *FGF-23* transcription *via* direct, vitamin D response element-mediated transcriptional activation and indirectly *via* extracellular signalling pathways, which are mediated by leptin and IL-6 and generate phospho-STATs (signal transduction mediators of leptin and IL-6 action).<sup>46</sup> We now show that calcitriol also increases Nurr1 mRNA levels in UMR106 cells, which would then contribute to the increase in FGF23 expression by vitamin D. Calcium deficiency decreases serum FGF-23 levels in rats fed a calcium-deficient diet, despite high serum levels of phosphate and PTH.<sup>42</sup> Bone remodeling, which is also induced by SHP, and release of low-molecular-weight FGFs are also important contributing factors.<sup>47,48</sup> FGF23 decreases PTH levels, as well as acting on the kidney to cause a phosphaturia and decrease the synthesis of calcitriol<sup>1,5</sup> (Figure 7). In advanced CKD, there is downregulation of the FGF23 receptor complex, klotho-FGFR1, and resistance to the action of FGF23 in both the parathyroid and kidney.<sup>7-9,49</sup>

We show that PTH increases Nurr1 levels. Moreover, Nurr1 overexpression activates FGF23 promoter activity, and Nurr1 knockdown prevents the effect of PTH on FGF23. Together with the correlation between PTH, Nurr1, and FGF23 levels *in vivo*, our data demonstrate that PTH activation of Nurr1 is essential for the effect of PTH to increase FGF23 levels.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Animals

Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (150–174 g) were fed a control or an adenine high-phosphorus diet (0.75% adenine, 1.5% phosphorus) (Teklad, Madison, WI) for 14 days, to induce renal failure. The calcimimetic agent R568 (5 mg/kg) or vehicle as control was injected ip daily for the entire period of the diets. Six rats were used in each group. One hour after the last injection, rats were anesthetized using a ketamine-xylazine mixture, blood was drawn for biochemistry, and calvaria was excised. All animal experiments were approved by the Hadassah Hebrew University Animal Care and Use Committee.

### Serum biochemistry
Serum was analyzed for calcium, phosphorus, and creatinine using QuantiChrom kits (BioAssay Systems, Hayward, CA) and the rat intact PTH ELISA kit (Immutopics, San Clemente, CA).

### In vitro studies
UMR106 cells were received from N Krieger (University of Rochester, Rochester, NY). The cells (passages 15–20) were plated in 96-well tissue culture plates (5×10⁴ cells in each well). Cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 20 mmol/l HEPES, 1% glutamine, and 0.1% penicillin-streptomycin (Biological Industries, Kibbutz Haemek, Israel). 10⁻⁷ mol/l PTH (3–34) (PolyPeptide, Strasbourg, France), rat PTH (1–34), or vehicle (L-cystein 0.01%) (Sigma-Aldrich St Louis, MO) were added to the medium. Actinomycin D (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO) was added with PTH or vehicle where indicated at a concentration of 1 μg/ml. Forskolin (LC Labs Woburn, MA) diluted in DMSO was added at 10⁻⁶ mol/l for 24 h. At indicated time points, cells were collected in 80 μl of TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 4 μg of RNase-free glycogen (Roche, Mannheim, Germany).

### Chromatin immunoprecipitation (CHIP)
UMR106 cells in a confluent 75-cm² flask underwent formaldehyde cross-linking and were harvested in PBS. Cells were sonicated, and the lysate was incubated with magnetic beads prebound to anti-Nurr1 antibody (SC-990, Santa Cruz, CA). Cross-linking was reversed by heat (65 °C for 6–15 h) and proteins were digested

Nurr1 knockdown by shRNA
UMR106 cells were grown to 50% confluence in 12-well plates and were infected with $5 \times 10^4$ infectious units of Nurr1 or scrambled shRNA lentiviral particles (sc-270437-v and sc-108080, respectively, Santa Cruz, CA) in medium containing 5 μg/ml polybrene. Medium was replaced 24 h after infection, and after an additional 48 h selection medium containing 2 μg/ml puromycin was used.

RNA extraction from rat calvaria
Calvaria bones were removed and immediately snap-frozen. A piece of the calvaria disc of similar size (~1/4) was minced to a fine powder in liquid nitrogen using a mortar and pestle, homogenized in TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) with a polytron, and total RNA was extracted according to the manufacturer’s instructions. In some experiments, the calvaria piece was partially homogenized in TRIzol reagent using a bead beater. Integrity of the RNA was confirmed by agarose gel.

qRT-PCR analysis
cDNA was synthesized using the High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), and qPCR analysis was performed with PerfeCTa SYBR Green FastMix (Quanta, Gaithersburg, MD) in the 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).

Primers
Primers were designed with the Primer Express 3.0 software (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).

Western blotting
Calvaria proteins were extracted from the organic phase of the Trizol RNA extraction samples according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The protein pellet was dissolved in 10 mol/l urea/20 mmol/l DTT solution and separated by SDS-PAGE for western blotting. Membranes were incubated with anti-Nurr1 antibody (SC-990, Santa Cruz, CA) or anti-α-tubulin (Sigma-Aldrich St Louis, MO), followed by secondary antibody and ECL luminescence reagent (SC-2048, Santa Cruz, CA).

Immunohistochemistry
Femurs were dissected free of soft tissue and immersed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 h at room temperature. After decalcification with formic acid-sodium citrate for 2–3 weeks at room temperature, specimens were dehydrated through a graded series of isopropyl alcohol and embedded into paraffin. Dewaxed sections were treated with 3% hydrogen peroxide for 5 min and heated in a pressure cooker at 115 °C for 3 min. Sections were incubated with an antibody against Nurr1. All sections were faintly counterstained with hemotoxylin.

Figure 7 | Model for the PTH-FGF23 feedback loop. PTH binds to the PTH receptor (PTH1R) on osteocytes and osteoblasts to activate PKA, which increases Nurr1 expression. Nurr1 induces FGF23 transcription by binding to defined NBREs in the FGF23 promoter. FGF23 in turn inhibits PTH production but not in CKD. In CKD, the hyperparathyroidism increases Nurr1 and then FGF23 expression. Calcimimetics decrease PTH, Nurr1, and FGF23. PTH and FGF23 are both phosphaturic. cAMP, cyclic adenosine monophosphate; CKD, chronic kidney disease; NBRE, NGFI-B response element; PKA, protein kinase A; PTH, parathyroid hormone.

using proteinase K (0.2 μg/μl, 55 °C for 2 h). DNA was cleaned using Wizard SV gel and the polymerase chain reaction clean-up system (Promega, Madison, WI), and was subjected to qPCR.

Plasmid transfections
The Nurr1 expression vector was courtesy of B Reubinoff (Hadassah Hospital, Jerusalem). Mouse Nurr1 full-length cDNA was inserted downstream to the hEF1-α promoter in a plasmid derived from the p373 plasmid. Control plasmid was produced by removing the Nurr1 sequence from the plasmid using PstI restriction enzyme.
The mouse 8-kb FGF23 promoter-firefly luciferase plasmid was kindly provided by D Quarles (Memphis).³³ The truncated FGF23 promoter luciferase plasmids were generated from the above promoter containing plasmid by cleavage and re-ligation using the restriction enzymes SmaI (Δ–3933 to –20), SpeI (Δ–6870 to –1275), SpeI + NheI (Δ–7992 to –1275), or SpeI + SacI (Δ–7992 to –555) (Figure 4a). A TK-renilla luciferase plasmid was received from M Walker (Weizmann Institute, Rehovot) and was used as a control for transfection efficiency in the luciferase assays. The plasmids were transfected into 60–70% confluent cell cultures grown in 12- or 6-well plates using jetPRIME Transfection Reagent (Polyplus, Illkirch, France). At 4 h after transfection, the cells were split into 96-well plates. After 24 h, the cells were treated as indicated, and cells were collected for RNA extraction or luciferase assays using a dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega, Madison, WI). Transfection experiments were repeated 1–3 times.

### Bioinformatic promoter analysis

FGF23 promoter analysis was conducted on mouse (UCSC Genome Server (GRCm38/mm10)), rat (UCSC Genome Server (Baylor 3.4/m4)), and human (UCSC Genome Server (hg19)) genomic DNA sequences. The analysis was restricted to –8Kb to +100bp, which were used in the luciferase reporter assays. Sequence alignments and consensus sequences were derived using AlignX (a component of Vector NTI Advance 11.5.0, Invitrogen, part of Life Technologies) and JalView.⁵⁰ The Nurr1 consensus-binding motifs used in the analysis were AAAGGTCA²² CCAAGGTCA⁵¹ and AAGGTCAC (Jaspar: http://jaspar.genereg.net/,⁵²). The computational programs utilized were ClOVER and ORCA, which analyze human, mouse, or rat promoter sequence based on Nurr1-binding motifs (ClOVER), and these motifs along with both human and mouse promoter sequences for homology comparison (ORCA). The parameters used for ClOVER were as follows: Randomizations, 1000; Motif score threshold, 6; Randomize nucleotides, OFF; Randomize dinucleotides, OFF; Randomize motifs, OFF; Lowercase filtering, OFF; Pseudocount, 0.375; and Random seed, 1. ORCA was utilized using standard parameters.²⁸

### Statistical analysis

Statistical significance was determined using the Student’s *t*-test. Plot bars depict standard error. A two-sided *P*-value was considered significant when <0.05.

### Significance statement

High serum PTH and FGF23 levels in chronic kidney disease (CKD) predict mortality. PTH increases bone FGF23 expression *in vivo* and *in vitro*. We show that the increased FGF23 expression by PTH is mediated by an orphan nuclear receptor Nurr1. We map functional regions and Nurr1-binding sites in the FGF23 promoter that mediate the effect of PTH and Nurr1 on FGF23 promoter activity. Nurr1 knockdown prevented the FGF23 increase by PTH. In CKD rats, calvaria Nurr1 mRNA levels were increased together with high serum PTH and FGF23 expression. Calcimimetics decrease PTH and FGF23 levels in rodents and CKD patients and decreased bone Nurr1 and FGF23 expression in CKD rats. We identify the mechanism for the PTH-FGF23 endocrine axis.
