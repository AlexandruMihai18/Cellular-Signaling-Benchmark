**Abstract** The production of pathogenic antibody has been traditionally viewed as the principle contribution of B cells to the pathogenesis of immune-mediated glomerulonephritis. However, it is increasingly appreciated that B cells play a much broader role in such diseases, functioning as antigen-presenting cells, regulators of T cells, dendritic cells, and macrophages and orchestrators of local lymphatic expansion. In this review, we provide an overview of basic B cell biology and consider the evidence implicating B cells in one of the archetypal immune-mediated glomerulonephritides, lupus nephritis.

**Introduction**

The role of the B cell in the pathogenesis of immune-mediated glomerulonephritis (GN) has traditionally been viewed as limited to that of antibody producer. These antibodies may bind directly to glomerular antigens or form immune complexes which deposit in glomeruli initiating inflammation. However, it is increasingly appreciated that B cells contribute to the pathogenesis of GNs in many other ways; They can function as potent antigen-presenting cells (APCs), and in this role, their ability to clonally expand make them highly efficient activators of antigen-specific T cells. More recent evidence suggests that B cells also play a role in the production of lymphangiogenic factors; thus, the B cell may orchestrate the local expansion of lymphatics required to support a florid immune response. Furthermore, B cells may regulate T cells and dendritic cells (DCs) through the production of cytokines or regulatory antibodies.

At the most basic level, B cells may be implicated in the pathogenesis of a number of GNs both by their presence (as activated mature B cells or in their terminally differentiated form, the plasma cell) or by the presence of antibody or immune complexes in diseased renal tissue. By these criteria, the B cell could be implicated in variety of GNs including lupus nephritis, IgA nephropathy, membranous nephropathy, membrano-proliferative GN,

Goodpasture’s disease, post-streptococcal GN and cryoglobulinaemic vasculitis. However, such circumstantial evidence does not prove a role in pathogenesis. Therapeutic agents which specifically target B cells, e.g. rituximab, have demonstrated that B cells may be important in diseases in which antibody and immune complexes are not found within renal tissue, including anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis. Animal models of glomerular disease, particularly those utilising murine knockouts and transgenics, have been extremely useful in clarifying the function of B cells in many immune-mediated GNs. Because of the wealth of information available, we have chosen to use the example of lupus nephritis to explore the many and varied ways in which B cells may contribute to the pathogenesis of immune-mediated GN. We will first briefly set out what is known about the B cell, the part it plays in an immune response and the mechanisms which enforce B cell tolerance. We will then go on to discuss the evidence for, and the mechanisms of, involvement of B cells in lupus nephritis.

### B cell biology

#### B cell development and antibody production

The purpose of B cell development is to produce cells with a diverse range of antibody specificities capable of responding to foreign, but not self-antigen. Antibodies consist of two identical heavy chains and two identical light chains which are held together by disulphide bonds. The N-terminal of each chain possesses a variable region that forms the antigen-binding site. The constant (Fc) region defines the class of the antibody (IgM, IgG, IgA, IgE, IgD) and determines if the light chains is of the κ or λ type. The genes encoding antibodies are grouped in three clusters: the *IGH* cluster encoding the heavy chain, the *IGK* cluster encoding the κ light chain and the *IGL* cluster encoding the λ light chain. Within each cluster, there are three or four types of gene segments, *V*, *J*, *C* and *D* segments. All of these segments contain multiple genes; hence, an enormous molecular variety can be generated by splicing and recombination. Indeed, it has been estimated that in humans, lymphocytes can produce about \(10^{15}\) different antibody variable regions [1].

B cells develop from pluripotent stem cells in the bone marrow. The first member of the committed B cell lineage is the pro-B cell. This undergoes significant heavy chain rearrangement resulting in the expression of an intact μ chain and a surrogate light chain, which form the pre-B cell receptor complex. The surrogate light chain acts as a screen for those heavy chains with V regions that will associate well with light chain to form a functional B cell receptor (BCR). Thus, those pre-B cells with unfavourable heavy chain structures do not undergo pre-B cell clonal expansion and fail to develop further. Those with suitable heavy chain rearrangements subsequently divide, giving rise to small pre-B cells in which light chain gene VJ gene rearrangement allows the successful assembly of surface IgM molecules. These immature B cells are subject to selection for self-tolerance and undergo further differentiation to become mature B cells, expressing both IgM and IgD. Amongst the enormous numbers of B cells produced, those that recognise a specific antigen (usually in the context of T cell help in a lymphoid follicle) complete their differentiation into antibody-producing plasma cells or memory B cells [2]. Those that fail to enter lymphoid follicles have a short life span, whereas those in follicles subsequently recirculate for 1–2 months. Thus, B cell development is an orderly sequence of proliferation, immunoglobulin gene segment rearrangement, with selection of cells possessing productive rearrangements and death of unselected or autoreactive cells [3, 4].

The production of antibody by B cells is dependent on antigen encounter. Antigens which elicit an antibody response can be divided into two groups on the basis of the need for T cell assistance. Antigens that require B and T cell collaboration to generate an antibody response, and thus fail to produce a response in athymic mice, are known as T-dependent (TD) antigens. The second group of antigens can stimulate antibody production in the absence of conventional T cell help and are termed T-independent (TI). In response to TD antigens, adaptive immune responses are generated in the spleen, lymph nodes and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue, known collectively as secondary lymphoid tissue. Encountered antigen is bound to the BCR (surface immunoglobulin) where it is internalised, processed and returned to the cell surface bound to MHC class II molecules. On entering lymphoid tissue, these B cells engage antigen-specific T cells in the T cell zone. The antigen:MHC complex is recognised by specific CD4 + T cells, triggering the production of a variety of cytokines, (in particular interleukin (IL)-4), which cause B cell proliferation and differentiation into antibody-producing plasma cells. A number of co-stimulatory molecules on the surface of B and T cells also interact, for example, CD40 and CD40 ligand or CD80/86 and CD28. It should be emphasised that this interaction between B and T cell is reciprocal, each providing essential cytokine and cell-contact signals for the other, enabling the development of an effective immune response [5, 6]. The interaction prompts the migration of the B cell and its progeny to primary follicles (where they form germinal centres) or to extra-follicular foci. Germinal centres are rich in cytokines, follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) displaying antigen, and T cells. Proliferating Bcells in the dark zone of the germinal centres divide rapidly and are known as centroblasts. The centroblasts give rise to centrocyes which closely interact with FDCs in the light zone. Antigen activation of B cells within germinal centres not only initiates proliferation but also somatic hypermutation, allowing single nucleotide exchanges to be introduced into the rearranged V-region genes. This process generates a large number of antigen-specific B cells [7–10].

The first antibodies produced by B cells are of the IgM class. These early antibodies are produced before B cells undergo somatic hypermutation and tend to be of low affinity. However, they exist in a pentameric form and are therefore able to bind simultaneously to multivalent antigens (i.e. they are of high avidity). The large size of these pentamers means that IgM is usually confined to the circulation. The other antibody isotypes exist as monomers (IgG, IgE, IgD) or as dimers (IgA) and can diffuse out of the blood stream into tissues. IgG is the principle isotype in blood and extracellular fluid, and IgA is found primarily in mucosal secretions. In these isotypes, the affinity of antibody for antigen is critical for effective function; therefore, selection of B cells for high antigen affinity tends to occur after they have undergone isotype switching to IgG, IgE or IgA [1, 7, 11]. The antigen-specific antibody produced may bind to invading microbes or their toxins neutralising their effects directly or may facilitate other mechanisms of disposal (a process known as opsonisation). FcγRs bind to the Fc portion of IgG, may be activatory (FcγRI, IIa, IIIa, IIIb, and IV) or inhibitory (FcγRIIb) and mediate many effector functions of antibody [12, 13]. Antibody-coating pathogens may be recognised by FcγRIIIa receptors on natural killer cells triggering the release of cytotoxins (antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity or ADCC). Antibody can bind to Fc receptors on phagocytic cells such as macrophages and neutrophils, facilitating phagocytosis and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines or may mediate immune complex uptake by APCs such as dendritic cells. Alternatively, antibodies may activate the complement system causing direct lysis of the pathogen or further enhancing opsonisation [14]. Thus antibodies directed inappropriately against self-antigen or immune complexes deposited in tissue may initiate a florid inflammatory response via FcγRs and complement.

### B cell tolerance

Given the importance of preventing B cell antigen presentation to autoreactive T cells and the production of autoantibodies, there are a number of “checkpoints” at which autoreactive B cells are eliminated or neutralised, thus, ensuring B cell tolerance. These occur both during B cell development (central tolerance) and after antigen encounter in the periphery (peripheral tolerance). Alternatively, self-antigen can be sequestered inside cells or within native protein folds or exist in sites of immunological privilege (for example, the eye) and are thus hidden from B cells. Tolerance to them is therefore never developed in normal circumstances, as they are not exposed to the immune system, a state termed “immunological ignorance” [15].

During B cell development in the bone marrow, immature B cells (at the stage of light chain gene rearrangement) encountering antigen capable of cross-linking their B cell receptor are either eliminated (clonal deletion), become unresponsive (anergic) or undergo revision of their B cell receptor to eliminate self-reactivity (receptor editing). High-affinity interactions with membrane-bound antigen result in deletion, whereas lower-affinity interactions and encounter with soluble antigen allows editing or anergy (the latter is characterised by expression of IgD and downregulation of IgM). Immature cells that do not encounter antigen mature normally and migrate from the bone marrow to the peripheral lymphoid tissue [3, 16, 17].

Despite these mechanisms of central tolerance, some autoreactive B cells escape deletion or anergy. Thus, a number of mechanisms exist to preserve tolerance in the periphery. In many cases, B cells fail to undergo T-dependent activation due to the absence of appropriate T cell help. T cell tolerance can, thus, by depriving the B cell of help, impose tolerance on the B cell repertoire [18]. It is also possible that autoreactive B cells presenting antigen to CD4 + T cells can be eliminated by delivery of a death signal from Fas ligand on T cells. Naïve B cells binding antigen become activated, resistant to apoptosis and capable of clonal expansion, whereas self-reactive B cells, “desensitised” by chronic binding of autoantigen, down-regulate CD86/80 and remain sensitive to apoptosis. They may, thus, be eliminated in the T cell zone [19]. Once in germinal centres, unwanted autoreactive B cell clones may be produced as a result of somatic hypermutation. Those binding foreign antigen immobilised on FDCs are selected for survival, whereas those binding soluble antigen undergo apoptosis, perhaps providing a mechanism for the deletion of autoreactive germinal centre B cells [20, 21]. B cell activity is also kept in check by a number of negative regulatory molecules for example, FcγRIIb, CD22, CD72 and PIR-B. These molecules maintain a tonic inhibition of B cell responsiveness and play a role in enforcing tolerance [22]. FcγRIIb is also important in controlling bone marrow plasma cell persistence. In the absence of FcγRIIb, plasma cells are protected from apoptosis; thus, defects in this receptor in plasma cells may well contribute to the production of autoantibody [23].
B cells in lupus nephritis

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a systemic autoimmune disease and can affect almost any organ. Lupus nephritis is one of the more frequent and serious complications and has a profound effect on morbidity and mortality both directly and through the complications of therapy. Immunological abnormalities observed in SLE include the presence of autoantibodies (particularly antinuclear antibodies (ANAs) and anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies (dsDNA)), hypergammaglobulinaemia and hypocomplementaemia. Histopathological examination of affected tissues demonstrates immune complex and complement deposition [24]. In the kidney, appearances vary, but typically, immune deposits are found in the mesangium and subendothelium with associated proliferation of mesangial and endothelial cells and infiltration of neutrophils, monocytes and lymphocytes. In severe cases, there is more extensive subendothelial immune deposition and extracapillary proliferation leading to crescent formation. Immunofluorescence shows a “full house” pattern with detectable polyclonal (as evidenced by similar κ and λ staining) IgG, IgA and IgM, as well as C1q and C3. It is thought that the pathogenic antibodies are IgG, and at least some of these have high affinity for autoantigens such as DNA [25].

Central to the pathogenesis of SLE is the production of autoantibodies which may react with nuclear, cytoplasmic, cell membrane and extracellular matrix components. Some of these antibodies subsequently form the immune complexes detectable in glomeruli which initiate inflammation and tissue damage (Fig. 1). This pathway raises a number of questions about B cells and the autoantibodies they produce in SLE:

- What causes the emergence of autoantibody-producing B cells?
- How do nephritogenic autoantibodies localise to the kidney and cause inflammation and disease?
- What are the antibody-independent roles of B cells in lupus nephritis?

What causes the emergence of autoantibody-producing autoreactive B cells?

The presence of autoantibodies in patients with SLE suggests that one of the major abnormalities underlying disease development is a breakdown in the mechanisms which maintain B cell tolerance. Thus, failure to remove autoreactive cells during B cell development, abnormal exposure of self-antigen and abnormalities of B cell

Fig. 1 Pathogenic pathway in SLE. a B cell tolerance is broken as a result of a failure of mechanisms which remove or tolerate autoreactive B and T cells, abnormal exposure of self-antigen, for example, during apoptosis, or due to abnormal B cell activation, for example, due to defective inhibitory signalling. b APCs, including B cells, present self-antigen to autoreactive T cells, which, in turn, provide help to B cells driving the production of autoantibodies. c

Autoantibodies produced by B cells may be directly pathogenic, e.g. those causing haemolytic anaemia, may form immune complexes in situ or may form circulating immune complexes which are not adequately disposed of, and therefore, become deposited in glomeruli. d Deposited immune complexes initiate an inflammatory response via FcγR-mediated macrophage (M) and neutrophil (N) activation or by activating complement

activation thresholds have all been implicated in the pathogenesis of SLE (Fig. 1).

**Failure to remove autoreactive B cells**

To enforce central and peripheral tolerance, autoreactive B and T cells must be removed. This is achieved by mechanisms of programmed cell death (apoptosis). Abnormalities of the apoptotic process allow the persistence of autoreactive cells, which may subsequently become activated leading to a breakdown in self-tolerance. The proto-oncogene *bcl-2* was originally identified as the result of its chromosomal translocation in follicular lymphoma [26] and encodes a 24-kDa membrane-associated protein which protects cells from apoptosis [27]. Transgenic overexpression of Bcl-2 in B cells prevents apoptosis, blocks peripheral self-tolerance and can predispose to autoantibody production and immune-mediated glomerulonephritis [28]. Thus, breakdown of pathways of programmed cell death may well lead to the survival of autoreactive cells and to autoimmune disease. CD95 (Fas) is a member of the nerve growth factor/tumour necrosis factor receptor superfamily and can initiate a signal transduction cascade leading to apoptosis. It is expressed at high levels in activated lymphocytes and acts as a major pathway for the peripheral deletion of antigen-primed lymphocytes [29, 30]. Humans with Fas mutations develop an autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS), which is characterised by massive lymphadenopathy and autoimmune disease [31]. MRL mice homozygous for the *lpr* or *gld* mutation (leading to non-functional Fas or FasL proteins, respectively) have increased numbers of B and T cells, and on certain genetic backgrounds, develop autoantibodies, lymphadenopathy and immune complex-mediated glomerulonephritis [32, 33]. Furthermore, mice heterozygous for PTEN, a phosphatase involved in apoptosis, have impaired Fas response and develop a disease comparable to Fas mutants [34].

It has been proposed that antigen in the germinal centre is retained in the form of immune complexes bound to FDCs, and hence, B cell stimulation can occur either through FcγRIIb alone resulting in apoptosis or through both FcγRIIb and the BCR producing survival [35]. Therefore, a failure of FcγRIIb function might allow the persistence of autoimmune B cells. Recent work suggests that FcγRIIb may additionally contribute to the maintenance of peripheral tolerance via receptor editing [36]. In addition to its controlling role in peripheral tolerance, FcγRIIb may also play a role in central B cell tolerance [37]. FcγRIIb is expressed on pre-B cells, and ligation (in the absence of B cell aggregation) can induce cell death and inhibit migration [37]. However, if the pre-B cell receptor is cross-linked, then FcγRIIb can inhibit apoptosis [38]. FcγRIIb is also important in controlling plasma cell

survival. Plasma cells from lupus-prone mice, including NZB, 129 and MRL, do not express FcγRIIb and are protected from apoptosis. Thus, defects in FcγRIIb may lead to an inappropriate persistence of plasma cells which contribute to the production of autoantibody [23].

Linkage and congenic studies in murine lupus models have identified a susceptibility locus on chromosome 1, *sle1b*, which impairs B cell anergy, receptor revision and deletion. Located within this locus are genes encoding the SLAM costimulatory molecules. One member of the SLAM family, Ly108, is highly expressed in immature B cells and exists in two isoforms *Ly108.1* and *Ly108.2*. The *Ly108.2* isoform functions to sensitise immature B cells to deletion by altering the strength of B cell signaling after BCR cross-linking. The lupus-associated *Ly102.1* isoform fails to augment BCR signaling leading to the persistence of self-reactive B cells. Thus, *Ly108* may function as a molecular rheostat, determining the stringency with which autoreactive B cells are censored during early development [39].

**Abnormal exposure of self-antigen**

In humans with lupus, the evidence for defective apoptosis as a mechanism of disease is much less clear. Only a quarter of patients with Fas or FasL mutations develop antinuclear antibodies [40]. In addition, increased levels of apoptotic cells have been found in SLE patients, although this did not correlate with disease activity [41]. The importance of this might lie in the observation that nuclear autoantigens cluster in blebs on the surface of apoptotic cells, for example, after exposure to UV light [42]. Post-translational modifications, such as ubiquitination, citrullination, phosphorylation and methylation, which occur during apoptosis, may also result in the presentation of cryptic self-antigens to which tolerance has not been established [43]. Normally, apoptotic cells are swiftly removed by neighbouring cells or professional phagocytes in a process which is not thought to generate a significant inflammatory response [44]. This rapid removal prevents the release of potential autoantigens from apoptotic blebs, which might then initiate a pro-inflammatory immune response and generate autoantibodies to nuclear components. Apoptotic cells express a number of “eat me” signals, for example phosphatidylserine, which facilitate uptake and are recognised by receptors on phagocytic cells, including the phosphatidylserine receptor, CD14, the C1q receptor, the vitronectin receptor and the MER receptor [44, 45]. Bridging molecules such as C1q, C-reactive protein, serum amyloid P protein (SAP), pentraxin-3, thrombospondin and prothrombin “opsonise” apoptotic cells and can mediate uptake by phagocytes or mask autoantigens [46].

Exposure of normal mice to syngeneic apoptotic thymocytes can induce transient anti-DNA and anti-
phospholipid antibodies [47]. Therefore, either an increased production or reduced disposal of apoptotic cells might lead to a breakdown of tolerance. Monocytes from patients with SLE show accelerated apoptosis in vitro [48]. In the NZB/W F1 mouse, there is a higher spontaneous apoptotic rate in splenic cells compared with BALB/c, suggesting an increased rate of production. However, it has also been noted that patients with SLE have impaired macrophage uptake of apoptotic neutrophils [49]. Furthermore, in NZB/W F1 and MRL mice, there is defective uptake of thioglycollate-induced apoptotic neutrophils by peritoneal macrophages [50]. Clq-deficient mice show high levels of ANAs and increased numbers of apoptotic bodies within glomeruli, suggesting a defect in clearance of apoptotic debris [51]. However, subsequent congenic analysis of the Clq knockout has demonstrated that these effects are likely due to genes in the surrounding area of chromosome 1 derived from the 129 mouse [52]. However, most patients with Clq deficiency do develop a lupus-like illness [53]. Deficiency of C4 [54], SAP [55] and MER [56] in mice results in an antinuclear autoimmune response and a glomerulonephritis, although in the SAP knockouts, the 129 background may be contributory. Prothrombin binds to apoptotic cells and appears to be a target of lupus anticoagulant antibodies [46]. Deficiency of DNase 1, an enzyme which digests chromatin-derived autoantigens, leads to an enhanced susceptibility to autoimmunity in mice, and mutations of *DNASE1* have been identified in humans with SLE [57]. To summarise, there is evidence to suggest that the display of nuclear antigens on the cell surface during apoptosis may facilitate the activation of autoreactive B cells and the presentation of these antigens to autoreactive T cells. Thus, impaired apoptotic cell clearance may contribute to the breakdown of tolerance to nuclear antigens.

### B cell hyperactivity

Upon antigen binding to the BCR, B cell activation thresholds are determined by the net effects of positive and negative regulatory molecules. If the balance between these inputs is disturbed, then autoimmunity can result. A reduction of inhibitory signals due to dysfunction of negative regulatory molecules such as FcγRIIb, CD22 and PD-1 or an excess of activatory signaling due to abnormalities of CD19 can both lead to a breakdown in tolerance.

### Defective B cell inhibition

FcγRIIb binds IgG and contains an immunoreceptor inhibitory motif (ITIM) within its cytoplasmic tail, which, when phosphorylated at its tyrosine residue, initiates an inhibitory signal [13, 58]. FcγRIIb is the only Fc receptor present on B cells, and co-ligation with the BCR during immune complex binding initiates a downstream signalling cascade which culminates in the neutralisation of BCR-mediated activation. There is increasing evidence to suggest that defective FcγRIIb inhibition is important in the pathogenesis of SLE. Polygenic murine SLE models such as MRL, NZB and BXSB have a deletion in the FcγRIIb promoter associated with reduced receptor expression on macrophages and activated B cells [59]. FcγRIIb-deficient mice have augmented humoral responses after immunisation with both T-dependent and independent antigens [60] and are susceptible to a number of antibody- or immune complex-dependent inducible models of autoimmunity, including collagen-induced arthritis [61], Goodpasture’s syndrome [62] and immune complex-mediated alveolitis [63]. In addition, FcγRIIb−/− mice derived on a 129/Sv/C57BL/6 background and back-crossed for ten generations onto a C57BL/6 background develop hypergammaglobulinaemia, autoantibodies (to antigens such as chromatin and dsDNA) and an immune complex-mediated autoimmune disease resembling SLE [64]. Transfer studies show that the disease is fully transferable and dependent on B cells. In NZB, BXSB and FcγRIIb-deficient mice, normalisation of bone marrow FcγRIIb expression by retroviral transduction of bone marrow cells leads to a reduction in levels of ANAs, antibodies to dsDNA and chromatin and renal immune complex deposition, together with improved survival compared with mice reconstituted with control transfected bone marrow [65]. Furthermore, mice heterozygous for FcγRIIb deficiency exhibit only a modest reduction in receptor expression, but have a definite predisposition to autoimmunity [66]; thus, even small alterations in FcγRIIb expression or function may have a profound effect on maintenance of self-tolerance. Interestingly, a combined deficiency of FcγRIIb together with a Fas mutation (C57BL/6 FcγRIIb−/−Fas^lpr/lpr^ mice) enhances the development of autoimmunity [67]. In humans, a lupus-associated FcγRIIb polymorphism (FcγRIIb^T232^) has defective inhibitory function, which is associated with B cell hyperactivity [68].

CD22 is a B-cell-specific negative regulator [69]. CD22-deficient mice show B cell hyperresponsiveness which correlates with the development of autoantibodies directed against double-stranded DNA [70]. Mice deficient in other molecules involved in the inhibitory pathway, such as Lyn and SHP-1, also display B cell hyperresponsiveness and autoimmune disease [71].

Programmed cell death gene-1 (PDCD1; or PD-1 as it is known in mice) is a 55-kDa transmembrane protein of the immunoglobulin superfamily which contains an ITIM in its cytoplasmic domain. Mice lacking PD-1 develop a lupus-like disease with arthritis and glomerulonephritis [72]. Apolymorphism in PDCD1 has also been identified in humans. An intronic SNP in PDCD1 is associated with the development of SLE in Europeans (found in 12% of affected individuals vs 5% of controls). The SNP alters a binding site for the runt-related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1) located in an intronic enhancer. Disruption of RUNX1 binding by the SNP may lead to aberrant regulation of PDCD1 expression and a release of autoreactive cells from inhibitory restraint [73]. Thus, defective negative regulation of B cell activation can lead to B cell hyperactivity and autoimmunity.

### Abnormal B cell activation

CD19 is a cell surface glycoprotein expressed exclusively on B cells in a complex with CD21 (complement receptor 2), CD81 and Leu 13 [74]. CD19 modulates the proliferation and activation signals delivered to the B cell by immunoglobulin. Co-ligation of the CD19/CD21/CD81 complex to the BCR results in a decrease in the activation threshold of B cells stimulated through surface IgM [75]. Overexpression of human CD19 in mice leads to elevated levels of immunoglobulin and hyperactive B cells [76]. Transgenic mice which express a model autoantigen, sHEL (soluble hen egg lysozyme) and high-affinity HEL-specific antigen receptors are functionally anergic and do not produce autoantibodies. However, overexpression of CD19 in these mice results in the breakdown of peripheral tolerance and the production of anti-HEL antibodies [77]. In addition, upregulation of CD19 has been noted in patients with systemic sclerosis [78]. Thus, by lowering the activation threshold on B cells, CD19 overexpression may contribute to the breakdown of tolerance and the development of autoimmune disease.

Scaffolding molecules, including CARMA-1 (also known as CARD-11) are important in determining whether BCR cross-linking leads to an immunogenic or tolerogenic response. These scaffolding proteins affect the polarity of response by promoting the assembly of particular signalling complexes around receptors [79]. CARMA-1 has been implicated in the breakdown of tolerance via the assembly of molecules which enhance cellular activation [80].

B cell activity factor (BAFF, also known as BLyS, TALL-1 and THANK) is a member of the TNF ligand superfamily and an important co-stimulator of B cell survival and expansion [81, 82]. High levels of BAFF have also been found in patients with lupus and appear to be associated with autoantibody production [83]. In addition, circulating BAFF is more abundant in NZB/W-F1 and MRL/lpr mice during the onset and progression of SLE [84]. Transgenic mice overexpressing BAFF in lymphoid cells develop autoantibodies, nephritis and sialadenitis, features reminiscent of both SLE and Sjogren’s syndrome

[85, 86]. In this transgenic model, BAFF appears to promote the survival of autoreactive B cells [87]. Surprisingly, T-cell-deficient BAFF transgenic mice also develop a lupus-like disease; thus, the production of autoantibodies occurs independent of T cell help. Instead, B cell stimulation through Toll-like receptors (TLRs) 7 and 9 was required for autoimmunity to develop [88]. TACI is a TNF receptor family member that binds BAFF. Loss of TACI in mice results in the formation of autoantibodies to nuclear antigens and immune complex deposition in the kidneys [89, 90]. Furthermore, treatment of NZB/W-F1 mice with soluble TACI-Ig fusion protein inhibits the development of proteinuria and prolongs survival of the animals [84]. BAFF blockade in non-human primates with an antagonistic antibody is effective in producing depletion of 50% of circulating B cells [91]. Together, these studies have identified BAFF antagonists and TACI-Ig as a possible treatment for SLE in humans. Of note, there is currently an ongoing phase II trial using anti-BAFF antibodies in patients with refractory rheumatoid arthritis, which have shown promising preliminary results [92], and clinical trials in SLE are likely to follow.

Stimulation of autoreactive B cells may also occur via Toll-like receptors (TLRs). TLRs are innate immune receptors which discriminate microbe from self. TLR7 and TLR9 detect microbial RNA and DNA, respectively, within intracellular compartments, but mammalian nuclear antigens contain motifs which can potentially trigger these receptors. TLR9 is expressed in B cells, DCs and macrophages and recognises bacterial DNA with multiple CpG nucleotides. Mammalian DNA is a less potent stimulator of TLR9 because many CpG motifs are masked by methylation. However, studies have shown that internalisation of mammalian DNA-containing immune complexes in DCs can be mediated by FcγRIIa, delivering the antigen into intracellular lysosomes containing TLR9, which subsequently initiates DC activation and the production of type I interferons [93]. More recently, TLR7 has also been implicated in the breakdown of tolerance through genetic studies on the murine lupus Y-linked autoimmune accelerator (Yaa) locus. This locus was found to contain a duplication of a segment of X chromosomal DNA containing the TLR7 gene, which was transposed to the Y chromosome [94, 95]. This transposition effectively doubled TLR7 gene expression within B cells enhancing responsiveness to TLR7 ligands including self-nucleic acids, thus, promoting proliferation of autoreactive B cells.

There is increasing evidence to suggest that type I IFNs (IFN-α and IFN-β) may play a role in the pathogenesis of lupus. It has long been recognised that some patients with SLE have elevated IFN activity in serum [96]. More recently, DNA microarray studies have identified an upregulation of IFN-induced genes in peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in patients with lupus which resolves after treatment with corticosteroids [97]. Furthermore, IFN therapy and viral infections can induce autoantibody formation in patients, some of which become symptomatic [98]. Much of the effect of type I IFNs in the pathogenesis of SLE may be due to activation of myeloid DCs into their mature form, capable of potent T cell activation [99]. However, type I IFNs also stimulate upregulation of TLR7 in DCs [100–104] and may do the same in B cells, potentially enhancing the response to self-antigen. Type I IFNs also induce the production of B cell activity factor BAFF, which may stimulate autoreactive B cell proliferation [82] and enhance the ability of CD4 T cell to provide B cell help [105].

How do nephritogenic autoantibodies localise to the kidney and cause inflammation and disease?

Once B cell tolerance is broken and autoantibodies form, some, but not all, patients develop immune deposits within glomeruli initiating inflammation and disease. In a number of animal models of SLE, anti-DNA antibodies have been shown to cause some pathological features of lupus nephritis [106]. Infusion of anti-DNA antibodies obtained from lupus-prone mouse strains such as MRL, into normal mice, prompts the development of a proliferative glomerulonephritis [107]. Intraperitoneal administration of a monoclonal anti-DNA antibody-secreting hybridoma into control mice can also induce glomerulonephritis, proteinuria and a dermal vasculitis [107]. In addition, mouse and human anti-DNA IgG applied to the isolated perfused rat kidney binds avidly to glomeruli and is associated with proteinuria and a reduction in inulin clearance [108]. However, in humans, the severity of disease in lupus nephritis is variable and does not correlate well with the levels of circulating anti-DNA antibodies [109, 110]. This observation is likely a result of differences in the specificity of autoantibodies, mechanisms of deposition and the inflammatory response initiated as well as non-antibody-mediated mechanisms of disease. Three theories have emerged as to how autoantibodies form immune deposits; Firstly, through direct binding to glomerular antigens, secondly, binding to a circulating antigen which had become deposited in the glomerulus and thirdly, deposition of pre-formed, soluble, circulating immune complexes. It is possible that all three contribute to the development of lupus nephritis.

In support of in situ mechanisms of immune complex formation are the observation that antibodies eluted from the kidneys of patients with SLE, and indeed from murine lupus kidneys, react with a number of extracellular glomerular antigens including basement membrane antigens, for example α-actinin [111, 112]. Some of these

antibodies may recognise non-DNA glomerular structures due to molecular mimicry. For example, autoantibodies to the endogenous retroviral glycoprotein gp70 and gp70-anti-gp70 immune complexes have been identified in diseased glomeruli of lupus-prone BXSB mice [113, 114]. Others have shown that circulating nucleosomes or low molecular weight DNA can act as “planted antigen” for the subsequent binding by anti-DNA or anti-nucleosome antibodies, leading to in situ immune complex formation [115–118]. For example, collagen, laminin and fibronectin have binding sites for DNA and could potentially capture and plant this antigen.

Circulating immune complexes may also become deposited in glomeruli, although these are not thought to initiate lupus nephritis but rather to drive established disease [118]. Defective mechanisms of circulating immune complex clearance or processing may, thus, exacerbate lupus nephritis. Immune complex formation is a physiological consequence of an adaptive humoral response. Binding of antibody to antigen is designed to promote the removal of foreign antigens, and this task is largely undertaken by the mononuclear phagocytic system of the spleen and liver. Complement components frequently become incorporated into circulating immune complexes and facilitate their transport via binding to CR1 on erythrocytes [119]. Tissue macrophages in the liver and spleen bear both FcγR and complement receptors, CR3 and CR4. The FcγRs involved in immune complex clearance by these cells are thought to be the low affinity FcγRII and FcγRIII [120, 121].

Several studies have also shown that clearance of IgG-coated erythrocytes is delayed in patients with SLE compared with controls [122, 123]. The clearance of soluble immune complexes is also abnormal in lupus patients, with reduced complement- and Fc-mediated uptake by the splenic mononuclear phagocytic system [124, 125]. Inherited deficiencies in the early classical pathway components (C1q, C2, C4) can lead to SLE [53, 126, 127]. Complement components are likely to be important in the disposal of apoptotic cells and in the removal of immune complexes. In support of this hypothesis, C1q-deficient mice have reduced splenic immune complex uptake [128, 129], although these effects may be due to genes in the surrounding area of chromosome 1 derived from the 129 mouse [52].

Fcγ receptors bind IgG-containing immune complexes and allow internalisation and clearance by cells of the reticuloendothelial system. FcγRIIa is a single-chain activatory receptor which is unique to humans [130]. A G>A point mutation has been identified in the FcγRIIA gene, which leads to either an arginine (R131) or histidine (H131) at amino acid position 131. These alleles are co-dominantly expressed; thus, an individual might express RR, HR or HH. FcγRIIa is the only FcγR that significantly binds
IgG2 containing ICs, and the affinity of this interaction varies between the polymorphic forms of the receptor in that FcγRIIa-H131 has a much higher affinity for both IgG2 and IgG3 [131]. This increased affinity for complexed IgG2 has functional consequences in that IgG2-opsonised particles (and to a lesser extent, IgG3-opsonised particles) are more readily internalised by phagocytes isolated from FcγRIIa-H131 homozygous individuals compared with FcγRIIa-R131 homozygotes [132]. A large number of studies have documented the frequency of FcγRIIa polymorphisms in patients with lupus [133]. Overall, it appears that the FcγRIIa-R/R131 allotype (which binds IgG2 and IgG3 containing IC less well) occurs with increased frequency in patients with SLE and in lupus nephritis (particularly in patients with IgG2 anti-C1q antibodies) [134, 135], suggesting that reduced Fc-mediated IC clearance may contribute to disease pathogenesis.

FcγRIII is another activatory Fc receptor which plays an important role in the disposal of ICs. There are two isoforms, FcγRIIIa and FcγRIIIb. The major polymorphism of FcγRIIIa is a point mutation (T>G) at nucleotide 559, which results in either a valine (V158) or phenylalanine (F158) at amino acid position 158. These alleles are also co-dominantly expressed, and, again, the alteration in an extracellular amino acid results in a change in binding to its principle ligands. It has been shown that the FcγRIIIa-V158 allele has a higher affinity for IgG1 and IgG3 and can also interact with IgG4 [136]. As with FcγRIIa, it is the lower affinity FcγRIIIa-F158 allele or F/F158 genotype, which has been associated with SLE or lupus nephritis in some populations.

FcγRIIIb is found only in humans and has no cytoplasmic domain and, therefore, no intrinsic signaling capacity. It is linked to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane by a glycosyl phosphatidylinositol anchor and is thought to mediate neutrophil recruitment [137]. Expression is limited to neutrophils, and two main isoforms exist, varying in their expression of the human neutrophil antigen (HNA). HNA1a and HNA1b (previously FγRIIIb-NA1 and FcγRIIIb-NA2) are encoded by genes which differ by five nucleotides (141, 147, 227, 277 and 349) within exon 3, resulting in a four amino acid substitution in its membrane-distal immunoglobulin-like extracellular domain. Due to differential glycosylation, they vary in their interaction with IgG in that FcγRIIIb-HNA1a has a higher affinity for IgG1 and IgG3 and can mediate phagocytosis of IgG1/3-complexed particles [138]. Studies of FcγRIIIb polymorphisms in patients with lupus have been conflicting, but most demonstrate an association of the HNA1b allotype with disease susceptibility [133, 139]. About 0.1% of central Europeans do not express FcγRIIIb on neutrophils due to gene deletion. Interestingly, Aitman et al. [140] have recently shown that there is copy number variation in the

human $FCGR3B$ gene and that low copy number was associated with lupus nephritis [141]. It may be that reduced neutrophil expression of FcγRIIIb or the expression of the lower affinity FcγRIIIb-HNA1b receptor leads to impaired glomerular clearance of immune complexes, thus, precipitating glomerular inflammation. This is supported by studies of neutrophil IC binding in an FcγRIIIb-null patient and in controls with varying $FCGR3B$ copy number (Willcocks et al., manuscript in preparation).

The antibodies found within glomeruli in SLE may not arise solely from plasma cells in secondary lymphoid organs. In the NZB/W mouse, high numbers of antibody secreting cells are found within the kidneys of diseased mice [142]. As discussed previously, abnormalities of plasma cell apoptosis have also been identified in murine lupus [23]. Together, these data suggest that in lupus nephritis, autoreactive plasma cells may accumulate and persist within inflamed kidneys where they enhance the local concentration of antibody and immune complex.

Once deposited within glomeruli, immune complexes may then induce tissue injury through the activation of complement or via FcγR-mediated activation of phagocytes and neutrophils. In support of this, deletion of activatory FcγRs protects mice from antibody-mediated spontaneous or induced autoimmune disease without altering titres of autoantibodies. This was demonstrated in the FcRγ-deficient NZB/NZW F1 mice which develop autoantibodies and have significant immune complex deposition, but do not develop glomerulonephritis [143]. Processing of immune complexes internalised by FcγRs on matured APCs in an inflammatory milieu propagates further inflammation and tissue damage and may even expose additional autoantigens. In addition, local deposition of immune complexes can initiate tissue damage via direct complement activation [144].

What are the antibody-independent roles of B cells in lupus nephritis?

### B cells as APCs

To activate autoreactive T cells, APCs such as B cells, DCs and macrophages must recognise, bind, internalise, process and present antigen to them. A number of studies in murine models of lupus suggest that abnormalities of antigen processing and presentation may lead to an excessive or inappropriate activation of T cells (Fig. 2). Lupus-like disease is ameliorated in NZB/W-F1 mice treated with an agent which reduces MHC class I expression, suggesting that MHC class I expression confers susceptibility to disease through presentation of self-peptides [145]. Other studies show increased maturation of macrophages and DCs (as evidenced by upregulation of co-stimulatory
Fig. 2 Possible roles of the B cell in lupus nephritis.

**a Increase in activatory functions**

- **B cells not produce autoantibodies (1) but also act as potent antigen presenting cells (2), may transfer self-antigen to DCs (3), drive lymphatic expansion via the production of lymphangiogenic factors such as VEGF-A (4) and facilitate DC and T cell migration to sites of inflammation via the production of cytokines such as IL-16 (5). An increase in such activatory functions may lead to autoimmunity.**

**b Decreased regulatory functions**

- **B cells can act as immunoregulators both via the production of regulatory antibodies, which may reduce immunogenic antigen presentation via the engagement of the inhibitory FcγRIIb on DCs (1) or via the production of regulatory cytokines, in particular IL-10. A reduction in these regulatory activities may lead to autoimmunity.**

molecules such as CD40, CD80 and CD86) in a murine lupus model (C57BL/6.sle3). Importantly, APCs from these mice were better at stimulating T cell proliferation in vitro [146]. Some studies in humans also support the concept that there is abnormal antigen presentation in SLE. Monocyte-derived DCs from lupus patients has shown spontaneous overexpression of CD86 and an increase in activation-induced secretion of IL-6 by DCs [147]. In addition, the inhibitory FcγR, FcγRIIb plays an important role in regulating B cell, DC and macrophage activation. A single nucleotide polymorphism in the FcγRIIb gene encodes a threonine (T) for isoleucine (I) substitution at position 232 within the transmembrane domain. FcγRIIb<sup>T232</sup> has been found at increased frequency in patients with SLE [139, 148–150] and has defective inhibitory function [151]. This is associated with an increased upregulation of MHC and co-stimulatory molecules in monocyte-derived macrophages after activation [151].

B cells are highly efficient APCs and can present peptides to T cells at up to 10,000-fold lower antigen concentration compared with non-antigen-specific APCs [152]. The importance of B cells as APCs in SLE has been emphasised by a number of murine studies. J<sub>H</sub>D-MRL/lpr mice (a B-cell-deficient version of the lupus-prone MRL/lpr mouse) fail to develop nephritis and dermatitis [153]. However, mIgM.MRL/lpr transgenic mice which have B cells but are unable to secrete antibody develop substantial nephritis and vasculitis, suggesting pathogenic B cell activity independent of antibody production [153, 154]. Furthermore, some experimental models suggest that B cells drive early autoreactive T cell activation before macrophage and DC-mediated autoantigen presentation,
which appears to be important later in the immune response [155]. This delay in antigen presentation by DCs and macrophages may by due to the time taken for maturation of these cell types or because B cells initially internalise antigen before transferring it to other APCs [156].

Antigen-presenting B cells may also amplify an autoreactive response via a mechanism known as epitope spreading. An autoreactive B cell may process self-antigen and present a variety of different peptides from within that antigen to activate a broad range of T cells. These, in turn, can potentially provide help to a different group of B cells which may recognise another part of the complex antigen. Thus, at first, autoantibodies to complex antigens such as ribonucleoprotein react with one or a few epitopes, but with time, a broader repertoire of autoantibody specificity recognising many epitopes is observed [157].

The importance of antigen presentation and the B cell–T cell interaction in lupus nephritis has been emphasised by the effectiveness of co-stimulatory blockade as a treatment strategy in lupus. CD40/CD40 ligand blockade reduces autoantibodies and renal B cell infiltration in a murine lupus model [158]. Treatment of SLE patients with an anti-CD40 ligand antibody resulted in a significant reduction in anti-dsDNA antibodies, proteinuria and improved clinical disease activity scores [159], although its use has been limited by its pro-thrombotic effects [160].

### B cells as regulators

After the initiation of an immune response, mechanisms must exist to regulate effector mechanisms. In recent years, there has been much interest in the identification and function of regulatory T cells [161]. However, subsets of B cells may also be involved in suppressing excess inflammation after an immune response either via the production of IL-10 or immunomodulatory antibodies. IL-10 is a regulatory cytokine that can dampen macrophage-mediated inflammation [162] and regulate the Th1/Th2 balance [163]. B cell production of IL-10 has been shown to be important in controlling inflammation in a number of experimental models of autoimmune disease including collagen-induced arthritis [164], experimental allergic encephalomyelitis [165], inflammatory bowel disease [166] and lupus [167]. In the latter study, B cells from several lupus strains failed to produce IL-10 when stimulated through BCR or CD40, in contrast to control B cells, although produced more IL-10 than controls when stimulated with CpG [167, 168]. In a murine congenic model of SLE (B6.Sle1.Sle2.Sle3), continuous overexpression of IL-10 in young mice significantly delayed antinuclear autoantibody production and decreased clinical nephritis [169]. In humans, IL-10-producing B cells can be identified by the expression of CD20+CD25+, belong to the memory B cell pool and have been found in patients with SLE [170]. However, it is likely that the role of IL-10 in SLE is complex. Multiple studies have reported high levels of IL-10 in SLE patients and in murine models of lupus [171, 172], and as well as its regulatory role, IL-10 can also enhance B cell proliferation [173]. Thus, a deficiency in the production of IL-10 may play a role early in disease pathogenesis in SLE, whilst elevated levels of IL-10 might reflect disease activity once inflammation has been initiated.

B cells may also control T cells and APCs migration via the production of chemoattractants. IL-16 is a polypeptide cytokine which can induce chemotaxis of CD4+ T cells, monocytes and monocyte-derived DCs [174]. B lymphocytes constitutively express IL-16, and IL-16 produced by unstimulated B cells can efficiently induce the migration of human monocyte-derived DCs [175].

Amongst the repertoire of antibodies produced by B cells, some appear to protect against inflammatory disease, as evidenced by the efficacy if intravenous immunoglobulin in some antibody-mediated autoimmune diseases. Studies suggest that engagement of the inhibitory receptor FcγRIIb on APCs by antibodies or immune complexes may promote DC tolerance [176, 177] and dampen macrophage-associated inflammation [178].

#### B cells as drivers of lymphangiogenesis

After the initiation of an immune response, lymphocytes and antigen-presenting cells are trafficked from sites of inflammation by a network of lymphatic vessels into draining lymph nodes. The lymph node and lymphatic vasculature subsequently expand to facilitate this process [179]. Many autoimmune diseases (including SLE) are characterised by local or systemic chronic inflammation, producing a sustained immune response. Immune cells infiltrating inflamed tissues often organise themselves into lymphoid organs, so-called lymphoid neogenesis, a phenomenon observed in diseased joints in rheumatoid arthritis [180] and in collagen-induced arthritis [181]. These tertiary lymphoid organs are thought to promote a local autoimmune response, thus, further amplifying inflammation [182]. The traffic of DCs from the renal interstitium to local lymph nodes is important for T cell stimulation in a number of models of renal injury and inflammation [183]. Thus, the expansion of lymphatic vessels at sites of inflammation, in addition to draining lymph nodes, may be important in perpetuating autoimmune responses. Recent evidence suggests that B cells play a critical role in this process through the production of lymphangiogenic factors such as VEGF-A [184]. Therefore, the B cell hyperactivity associated with SLE (see “What causes the emergence of autoantibody-producing autoreactive B cells?”) may drive excessive lymphangiogenesis.
Conclusion

B cells contribute to the pathogenesis of immune-mediated GNs through the production of autoantibodies or a failure to produce regulatory antibodies. They also play a much broader role in such diseases, functioning as potent antigen-presenting cells and regulators of T cell, DC and macrophage activation and migration. B cells may also facilitate the expansion of an inflammatory response via the stimulation of local lymphatic expansion. An increasing appreciation of their importance, particularly in lupus nephritis, has been supported by the efficacy of B cell targeted therapies in SLE [185, 186]. Their development has been underpinned by advances in the understanding of B cell abnormalities observed in lupus nephritis, and such efforts should allow the development of even more specific and less toxic therapies for patients affected by immune-mediated GNs.
