Macrophages are crucial in immunity to infection. They possess potent antimicrobial function, and efficiently process and present peptide antigens for T-cell activation. Despite this, the intracellular protozoan parasites *Toxoplasma gondii*, *Trypanosoma cruzi* and *Leishmania* spp. target macrophages for infection. Each has adopted unique strategies to subvert macrophage antimicrobial functions. The parasites sabotage killing activities through sophisticated manipulation of intracellular macrophage signaling pathways. These subversive activities are probably dictated by the need to evade microbicidal effector function, as well as to avoid proinflammatory pathology that can destabilize the host–parasite interaction. The molecular details of how intracellular protozoans manipulate macrophage signal transduction pathways for their own ends are beginning to emerge.

Macrophages are centrally located in the host response to infection. Production of factors such as reactive nitrogen and oxygen intermediates (RNIs and ROIs) endow these cells with potent microbicidal activity [1,2]. Furthermore, phagocytosis leads to rapid microbial degradation in lysosomes, a process increased by Fc and complement receptor-mediated uptake of opsonized pathogens [3]. Macrophages also efficiently process and present peptide antigens for major histocompatibility (MHC) class I- and class II-restricted presentation on the cell surface. Their simultaneous ability to express costimulatory molecules, most notably B7-1 (CD80) and B7-2 (CD86), certifies macrophages as professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Microbial peptide-bearing macrophages therefore activate antigen-specific CD4⁺ and CD8⁺ T cells and, as such, are an important component in the often-described bridge connecting innate and adaptive immunity [4]. Insofar as macrophages possess microbicidal and immune-activating properties, it is remarkable that several protozoan parasites successfully invade, survive and replicate within these potent host defense cells.

properties of targeting macrophages for invasion and establishing persistent infections in their mammalian hosts. Although *T. cruzi* and *Leishmania* are largely restricted to tropical regions of the globe, *Toxoplasma* is distributed worldwide among humans and animals. In humans, *T. cruzi* causes Chagas disease, which is characterized by chronic inflammation causing cardiomyopathy [5]. There are several different *Leishmania* sp. that cause a spectrum of human diseases ranging from nonlethal cutaneous leishmaniasis (*Leishmania major*) to visceral disease leading to death in some individuals (*Leishmania donovani*) [6]. Although *Toxoplasma* usually causes asymptomatic infection, it can emerge as a serious and sometimes lethal opportunistic infection in immunocompromised individuals [7].

Each of these parasites has adopted unique strategies to exploit macrophages to promote their own survival (Table 1). This principle first becomes apparent during host cell invasion. Entry into macrophages by *Leishmania* is largely a passive process for the parasite. Uptake of parasites is mediated by endocytosis of opsonized promastigotes through macrophage surface membrane receptors [8]. This occurs in part through the activity of *Leishmania* surface protease gp63, which cleaves host complement component C3b into iC3b; iC3b prevents complement-mediated parasite lysis and, in addition, iC3b deposited on the promastigote surface promotes receptor-mediated uptake through CR1 and CR3 [9]. The *Leishmania* parasites that are internalized by phagocytosis are rapidly trafficked to low-pH endosomes and lysosomes. Here, the parasites display the remarkable ability to survive and replicate within this hostile environment. Persistence might be associated with differentiation into the amastigote parasite form that resists the activity of macrophage hydrolases [10]. It has been proposed that parasite lipophosphoglycan (LPG) plays a role in delaying phagosome maturation, allowing generation of acid-resistant amastigotes, although this might depend in part upon the *Leishmania* species involved [11,12]. LPG and other parasite surface and secreted glycoconjugates have also been implicated in protecting *Leishmania* from proteolytic damage within acidic vacuoles [13]. Thus, *Leishmania* has successfully developed sophisticated means to cope with life in an extremely inhospitable environment.

**Three parasites, three survival strategies**

*Trypanosoma cruzi*, *Toxoplasma gondii* and *Leishmania* spp. are medically important parasites that share the dual

Toxoplasma enters virtually all nucleated cells, including macrophages, by active invasion [14]. This process is dependent upon a tachyzoite actin-myosin cytoskeleton [15]. During invasion, which is accomplished within 20–30 s, the host plasma membrane invaginates, forming a vacuole that surrounds the parasite. Host cell-surface proteins, with the exception of those that are anchored through glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI), are excluded as the vacuole forms [16]. Consequently, the nascent vacuole lacks molecules that normally govern recognition by host cell fusion machinery. As a result, the parasitophorous vacuole maintains a neutral pH and remains segregated from endocytic and exocytic trafficking pathways of the host cell [17,18]. The parasite-directed formation of the parasitophorous vacuole that occurs during invasion is probably regulated by sequential discharge of tachyzoite secretory organelles [19]. Micro-nemes located at the apical end of the parasite discharge first, and molecules such as microneme (MIC) proteins MIC2 and MIC2A play a role in adhesion of the parasite to the host cell [20]. Rhoptry contents are subsequently released into the host cell and these might be important for biogenesis of the parasitophorous vacuole. Finally, dense granule contents discharge, and the released proteins associate with the parasitophorous vacuole membrane and the tubulovesicular network that is involved in nutrient acquisition from the host cell. Unlike Leishmania, which has invested in a strategy of survival within a phagolysosomal compartment, *T*. *gondii* has developed complex mechanisms to avoid entry into this pathway at all costs, and the parasite instead directs formation of a sheltered niche within the cell.

Invasion by *T*. *cruzi* illustrates a third way that intracellular pathogens interact with host cells [21]. In this case, the parasite exploits a cellular wound-repair pathway to enter cells. The mechanism involves trypanomastigote-induced signaling that results in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent lysosome recruitment to the parasite attachment site and subsequent entry of *T*. *cruzi* into a lysosome-like vacuole [22]. The low pH of this compartment triggers the activity of TcTox. This molecule is a *Trypanosoma*-secreted protein with homology to mammalian complement component C9 [23]. TcTox forms pores in the parasitophorous vacuole, mediating parasite escape into the cytoplasm of the host cell. This process is facilitated by the activity of a parasite trans-sialidase that is involved in desialylation of lysosomal membrane glycoproteins [24]. Interestingly, signal transduction through host cell transforming growth factor (TGF)-β receptors also promotes trypanomastigote invasion of host cells [25]. The basis for this effect is not clear, but it has been suggested that signaling through the TGF-β pathway might be required to maintain the cells in a deactivated state during invasion [26]. In sum, *T*. *cruzi*

actively induces its uptake into lysosome-like host cell vacuoles, after which the parasite rapidly escapes into the cytoplasm.

In addition to adaptation for intracellular survival, *T*. *cruzi*, *T*. *gondii* and *Leishmania* have evolved mechanisms to target signaling pathways that underlie cellular defense. This is likely to be an integral component of how these protozoans survive within their hosts. Each parasite has distinct effects on proinflammatory signal transduction, which is most probably a direct reflection of the unique intracellular niches occupied by *Trypanosoma*, *Toxoplasma* and *Leishmania* (Figure 1).

**Leishmania – a history of evasion**

*Leishmania* parasites have long possessed the reputation of avoiding early immune activation, leading to the view of this pathogen as a stealth parasite that silently invades the host [27]. Such immune evasion is apparent in macrophages, where *Leishmania*-induced suppressive effects have been reported. For example, promastigotes promote dysfunctional responses in phagocytosis, and in production of ROIs and RNIs [28,29]. Interference with professional APC functions such as expression of interferon (IFN)-γ-induced MHC class II antigens and costimulatory molecules has also been reported [30,31]. Most dramatically, *Leishmania* has the capacity specifically to block expression of interleukin (IL)-12, which is pivotal in inducing a T helper cell type 1 (Th1) response [32]. This selective blockade has been linked to the activity of promastigote phosphoglycan [33]. Interference with these responses can be traced back to parasite-directed manipulation of multiple host signaling cascades.

*Leishmania* infection has been shown to inhibit macrophage protein kinase C (PKC) activity [34,35]. This has been linked to a decreased oxidative burst in response to stimulation with phorbol myristate acetate. Inhibitor blocking of macrophage PKC activity before infection has been shown to result in an increase in *Leishmania* levels in macrophages [34]. This result suggests that parasite-driven impairment of PKC is important in establishing infection. Mutant promastigotes that do not express LPG display decreased intracellular survival. Purified LPG also blocks PKC activity [36]. In this case, LPG might act as a competitive inhibitor of PKC activity, or it could act as a chelator of Ca<sup>2+</sup> that is required for PKC activity. Nevertheless, the ability of LPG amastigotes to block PKC implicates the suppressive activity of additional *Leishmania* molecules.

Protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) activity is also reduced in *Leishmania*-infected cells. This results in attenuation of IFN-γ-induced macrophage activation, a consequence of interference with signaling through Janus kinases (JAKs) and signal transducer and activator of transcription

Figure 1. Diverse effects of intracellular parasites on macrophage signaling and effector function. *Toxoplasma*, *Leishmania* and *Trypanosoma cruzi* each target components involved in macrophage signaling. The mechanisms involved are not yet well defined, but there is evidence for parasite-induced activity of specific phosphatases in each case. It is also likely that additional mechanisms are involved, particularly in the case of *Toxoplasma*, where blocks in nuclear import of transcription factors such as Stat1 and NF-kB have been reported. As a probable consequence of interference with intracellular signaling, macrophages display selective defects in production of proinflammatory mediators including ROI and RNI, cytokines such as IL-12 and TNF-α, and costimulatory molecules such as CD80 and CD86. Abbreviations: IL-12, interleukin 12; JAK, Janus-activating kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MHC, major histocompatibility complex; NF-kB, nuclear factor kB; ROI, reactive oxygen intermediate; RNI, reactive nitrogen intermediate; Stat, signal transducer and activator of transcription; (TNF)-α, tumor necrosis factor α.

(Stat) 1 [37]. The parasite-induced PTK decrease is probably related to rapid induction of a host Src-homology 2(SH2)-domain-containing phosphotyrosine phosphatase (PTP) called SHP-1 by *L. donovani* [38,39]. Recently, *Leishmania* elongation factor (EF)-1α was identified in promastigote lysates as a molecule that binds and activates SHP-1 in vitro and in vivo [40]. Although the trafficking mechanism is not clear, EF-1α appears to be exported out of the phagosome into the cytosol, where it activates SHP-1. Macrophages defective in SHP-1 are more efficient in limiting *Leishmania* survival, and SHP-1-deficient mice display a decreased inflammation during *L. donovani* infection that is associated with increased nitric oxide (NO) production [41]. Thus, *Leishmania* exploitation of host phosphatases is an important mechanism that is involved in the manipulation of macrophage signaling, leading to increased parasite survival.

Macrophages infected with *Leishmania* display a selective defect in IL-12 (p40, p70) production [32]. Purified LPG has been reported to display similar suppressive effects on IL-12 induction, possibly a result of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) Erk1/2 activation by *Leishmania*, as this MAPK has been implicated in negatively regulating induction of the gene encoding IL-12 [42]. Nevertheless, evidence has also been presented that *L. donovani* fails to activate MAPK during infection, unless macrophages are first primed with IFN-γ [43].

Possibly related to immune suppression by *Leishmania*, ligation of macrophage surface receptors such as Fcγ receptor and complement receptors CR1 and CR3 activates signaling cascades leading to selective IL-12 down-regulation [44,45]. Because opsonized *Leishmania* use these receptors for attachment and uptake into macrophages, it seems likely that this is an important mechanism underlying IL-12 suppression. CR3 ligation results in impaired Stat1 tyrosine phosphorylation through PTP induction, providing further evidence for a link to *Leishmania*-induced IL-12 suppression [44]. It has been suggested that the reason for specific IL-12 transcriptional suppression might relate to the transcription

factor IFN-γ consensus sequence-binding protein (ICSBP). Activation of the IL-12(p40) promoter seems to be unique in its requirement for ICSBP, which itself is regulated by PTP-sensitive Stat1 [26]. Stat1-independent pathways might ensure that production of other cytokines is unaffected by the presence of the parasite.

Trypanosoma cruzi – anchoring onto the TLR pathway *Trypanosoma cruzi* exploits host signaling pathways during invasion, forcing trypomastigote entry into the target cell [21]. The parasite also manipulates signaling involved in innate immunity. The ability of GPI anchors derived from *T. cruzi* trypomastigotes to trigger macrophage proinflammatory cytokines has been well characterized in recent years [46,47]. Thus, *Trypanosoma* GPI-mucin-like glycoproteins (tGPI-mucin) trigger signaling cascades that lead to induction of IL-12, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and NO. Chief among these signal transduction pathways are the MAPK and NF-kB cascades (Box 1). Initiation of the NF-kB and MAPK signaling cascades can be driven by activation through the Toll-like receptors (TLRs). The TLRs are a family of evolutionarily conserved pattern recognition receptors involved in sensing diverse microbial and viral molecules. For example, TLR4 is involved in recognition of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). *Trypanosoma cruzi* trypanotrypomastigote tGPI-mucin exerts its effects through TLR2, and it has also been reported that *L. major* LPG as well as *Toxoplasma* ligands can act through this particular TLR [48–50].

tGPI-mucin, like bacterial endotoxin, induces a state known as tolerance in macrophages. This phenomenon is most clearly described for LPS. Here, TLR4-mediated triggering by low-dose endotoxin results in nonresponsiveness to secondary LPS stimulation. This represents a reprogramming of macrophage function rather than global suppression, because although proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-12, IL-6 and TNF-α are suppressed, production of other mediators, for example NO and IL-10, is unaffected [51]. Mechanisms of endotoxin tolerance

Box 1. Activation of MAPK and NF-κB signaling pathways

Triggering of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor (NF)-κB signaling cascades in macrophages leads to the induction of many proinflammatory mediators. A major means through which the pathways are activated during microbial infection is by the Toll-like receptors (TLRs) [73]. These are a family of pattern recognition receptors that detect a wide spectrum of microbial molecules including nucleic acids, lipids and proteins. Whereas bacterial TLR ligands are becoming well characterized, protozoan molecules recognized by TLRs are, with a few exceptions, poorly defined. There are three major MAPK families, termed p38, stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK)/c-Jun NH₂-terminal kinase (JNK) and extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (Erk) 1/2 MAPK. Each is a serine/threonine kinase that targets transcription factors for activation. The MAPKs themselves are activated by upstream MAPK kinases (MKKs) and the MKKs, in turn, are activated by M3K kinases (M3Ks). There is a high degree of redundancy in MAPK signaling, in that a MAPK might be phosphorylated by the activity of multiple overlapping MKKs and the MKKs, in turn, are activated by multiple M3Ks. MAPK signaling is terminated by the activity of MAPK phosphatases (Figure I). The NF-κB pathway involves cytoplasmic degradation of the inhibitor IκB following its phosphorylation by an active IκB kinase (IKK) complex that can itself be activated by M3Ks such as TAK1. NF-κB subsequently translocates to the nucleus where it binds to promoter κB target sites on a large number of genes involved in the immune response. Signaling is terminated by induction of IκB, which is controlled by NF-κB signaling. NF-κB itself comprises a family of molecules (RelA, RelB, c-Rel, p50/p105, p52/p100) that

function as dimers. Only c-Rel and RelA have potent transcriptional activation domains. Induction of any given macrophage gene might require both MAPK and NF-κB signaling.

center on the MAPK and NF-κB activation pathways. Downregulation of TLR4, interference with biochemical signaling immediately downstream of TLR, induction of MAPK phosphatases, and induction of downregulatory NF-κB p50 homodimers are molecular mechanisms implicated in tolerance [51].

A key feature of tolerance is that agonists of a given TLR induce suppression of responses mediated through other TLRs. This phenomenon, which is termed cross- or heterotolerance, is generally similar to mechanisms of homotolerance. Trypomastigote tGPI-mucin displays tolerating effects on subsequent LPS-driven TLR4 and tGPI-mucin TLR2 signaling [52]. Both LPS and tGPI-mucin induce PP type 2A phosphatase activity correlating with induction of the macrophage hyporesponsive state. This is also associated with defects in phosphorylation of IL-1R-associated kinase (IRAK)-1, MAPK activation and IκB degradation. Importantly, tGPI-mucin-mediated induction of phosphatase activity is itself dependent upon p38 MAPK and NF-κB signaling [52].

In the above case, tGPI-mucin appears to function similarly to LPS in first inducing macrophage proinflammatory mediators followed by progression to a nonresponsive state [53]. It seems likely that this is a mechanism to avoid deleterious effects of long-term exposure to macrophage-activating stimuli that would occur in persistent infection. Unchecked macrophage proinflammatory cytokine production could rapidly lead to toxic levels of proinflammatory mediators, leading to pathology and death of the host.

Toxoplasma gondii – a subversive parasite, revealed

Infection with Toxoplasma has long been associated with strong, protective host defense [54,55]. This is characterized by production of proinflammatory cytokines that can

sometimes even reach pathological levels. Consequently, *T. gondii* has historically been regarded as a potent immunostimulatory microbial pathogen. Nevertheless, the fact that proinflammatory cytokine-mediated pathology does not usually occur to any significant extent during infection is a likely indicator of underlying immunomodulatory functions of the parasite. In part, this is due to induction of host cytokine responses such as production of IL-10. Nevertheless, it is becoming increasingly clear that *T. gondii* directly downmodulates proinflammatory signaling pathways independently of induction of host soluble anti-inflammatory mediators.

Cytokines such as IL-12 and TNF-α are readily measured in the sera of *T. gondii*-infected mice undergoing acute infection. However, *in vitro* experiments with bone-marrow-derived and thioglycollate-elicited macrophages, as well as several macrophage cell lines, reveal suppressed TNF-α and IL-12 production in tachyzoite-infected cells [56,57]. Synthesis of IL-12 is eventually initiated, but TNF-α remains blocked. Similarly, both MHC class II antigen expression and production of NO are suppressed in *Toxoplasma*-infected macrophages [58,59]. As such, these phenomena might represent parasite defense mechanisms to avoid, or at least delay, induction of microbicidal activity or induction of T-cell-mediated immunity. For example, whereas *T. gondii* suppresses IFN-γ-driven macrophage NO production, if the cells are pre-activated they become potent mediators of NO-mediated toxoplasmacidal activity [60,61]. From the perspective of the parasite, it is easy to understand how it would be important to invest in strategies to prevent NO production.

The NF-κB activation pathway is implicated in many macrophage proinflammatory responses, including induction of TNF-α, IL-12 and inducible NO synthase.

Toxoplasma gondii has the ability to block translocation of NF-κB p50:p65 heterodimers driven by LPS stimulation [56, 62]. Inasmuch as production of IL-12 is eventually initiated, it is interesting that the blockade in NF-κB translocation is lifted ~6 h post-infection [63]. Whether or not there is a functional link between these two observations is not yet clear.

The mechanism underlying reduced NF-κB translocation in infected cells is not yet established. Nevertheless, *T. gondii* itself triggers phosphorylation and degradation of IκB [56]. Absence of the NF-κB nuclear translocation that normally occurs as a result of IκB degradation suggests a defect in nuclear import of this transcription factor, or that the NF-κB nuclear exportation rate is greatly increased as a result of infection. Interestingly, IFN-γ-driven activation of Stat1, an early signaling event leading to MHC class II upregulation, is also defective in parasite-harbor ing cells [64, 65]. In parallel to the NF-κB results, failure in nuclear import of Stat1 occurs, despite the fact that the latter undergoes phosphorylation-dependent activation. The combined results raise the possibility of a generalized block in nuclear import, at least during the initial phase of infection. Because the nascent parasitophorous vacuole assumes a juxtanuclear position in the host cell, one possibility might be that close physical association between the parasitophorous vacuole and host cell nucleus might have a negative impact on nuclear import.

The immunosuppressive effects of *T. gondii* on infected macrophages extend well beyond defects in Stat1 and NF-κB nuclear import. Activation of MAPK family members is also modulated by the parasite. As with Stat1 and NF-κB, each of the major MAPKs (p38, SAPK/JNK and Erk1/2) is rapidly activated during *T. gondii* infection in macrophages [63, 66]. Nevertheless, when subjected to LPS-induced reactivation, rephosphorylation is defective, particularly for p38 MAPK [63]. In many ways, the result resembles those obtained using tGPI-mucin and LPS to induce macrophage endotoxin hyporesponsiveness. However, macrophage endotoxin hyporesponsiveness is likely to involve defects in early TLR/MyD88/IRAK signaling, and this does not appear to be the case for *T. gondii*. For example, MKK3, a major upstream kinase of p38, is maintained in an activated state, despite dephosphorylation of the latter [63]. These results raise the possibility that, like *Leishmania*, *T. gondii* might induce host phosphatases that act on components of proinflammatory signaling cascades.

Toxoplasma also displays the ability to induce resistance to apoptosis in infected cells [67, 68]. This might be a counter mechanism employed by the parasite to prevent the host cells from undergoing the programmed cell death (PCD) response [69]. From the perspective of the host, undergoing apoptosis might be a defense mechanism to limit spread of intracellular pathogens. Indeed, although less well characterized, both *L. donovani* and *T. cruzi* display similar anti-apoptotic effects on host cells [70, 71]. For *Toxoplasma*, the anti-apoptotic effect of intracellular infection is associated with interference with mitochondrial cytochrome c release into the cytoplasm and decreased caspase proteolytic activation [67]. In addition,

protein levels of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) are downregulated by *T. gondii*. These findings suggest that parasite-induced interference with PCD occurs at multiple points in the pro-apoptotic signaling cascade.

A recent report indicated that *T. gondii* blocks execution of fibroblast apoptosis through NF-κB-dependent induction of anti-apoptotic genes such as Bcl-2 and inhibitors of apoptosis (IAP) family members [72]. This finding, although interesting, is at odds with data arguing for lack of NF-κB activation during infection [56, 62]. Differences in host cell types used (fibroblasts versus macrophages) might account for the disparate results. It is also possible that the specific NF-κB components involved in anti-apoptotic versus pro-inflammatory responses are non-identical. Further work is clearly required to resolve these issues.

### Conclusion

A common survival strategy employed by many parasites is to avoid the host immune system. This occurs through mechanisms such as antigenic variation (e.g., *Plasmodium*, *Trypanosoma brucei*) and anatomic sequestration (e.g., formation of cysts). The protozoans discussed here actively target the macrophage—a major innate immune cell—for invasion. Not only can they successfully reside within macrophages, but they also manipulate signaling cascades within these cells to overcome potent immune defense mechanisms (Figure 1). Our knowledge of how *T. cruzi*, *Leishmania* and *Toxoplasma* achieve this end remains in many ways rudimentary. Molecular mechanisms underlying these host–parasite interactions still largely await discovery. Such knowledge promises to tell us much about the biology of the parasites and the host cells in which they reside.

**Insect Symbiosis**

Edited by K. Bourtzis and T. Miller

CRC Press, 2003, £72.99 (368 pages) ISBN: 0849312868

*Insect Symbiosis* is a collection of chapters written by world authorities on the microbes that can be called symbionts that are associated with insects and mites. Whether bacteria, fungi or spiroplasmids, and whether endosymbionts or casual gut symbionts, the authors describe some of the latest work in a field that has grown rapidly since the development of the newer molecular methods, which allowed for the identification of even minute samples of microbes without the need for culturing.

This book summarizes the current knowledge of the relationship between symbiotic organisms and their insect hosts, and provides an unparalleled analysis of cutting-edge research on this issue. Findings from international experts reveal possible new ways to control disease-carrying insects and agricultural pests, worldwide. An examination of Wolbachia, considered by many as a vehicle to deliver antimalarial and anti-plant-virus strategies, is also included. *Insect Symbiosis* serves as a great reference on host-parasite relationships for professionals from a broad range of fields.
