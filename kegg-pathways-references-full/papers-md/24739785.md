**Nuclear and cytosolic JNK signalling in neurons**

**Eleanor T. Coffey**

Abstract | It has been over 20 years since JUN amino-terminal kinases (JNKs) were identified as protein kinases that are strongly activated by cellular stress and that have a key role in apoptosis. Examination of *Jnk*-knockout mice and characterization of JNK behaviour in neuronal cells has further revealed the importance of the JNK family in the nervous system. As well as regulating neuronal death, JNKs govern brain morphogenesis and axodendritic architecture during development, and regulate important neuron-specific functions such as synaptic plasticity and memory formation. This Review examines the evidence that the spatial segregation of JNKs in neurons underlies their distinct functions and that compartment-specific targeting of JNKs may offer promising new therapeutic avenues for the treatment of diseases of the nervous system, such as stroke and neurodegenerative disorders.

JUN amino-terminal kinases (JNKs; also known as stress-activated protein kinases (SAPKs¹)) transfer phosphate groups to serine or threonine residues that are flanked by a carboxy-terminal proline. JNKs contribute to the high levels of proline-directed phosphorylation that is peculiar to the mammalian brain²,³. Indeed, JNK activity is higher in the brain than in any other mammalian tissue⁴⁻⁹, suggesting that members of this kinase family are key regulators of protein function in the nervous system.

JNKs are components of a classical mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling cascade (FIG. 1a) that serves to filter noise and allow signal amplification while maintaining upstream kinase complexity, enabling signalling diversity. JNKs and the protein scaffolds to which they bind display distinct patterns of subcellular compartmentalization in neurons that probably underlie their pleiotropic actions, which fall into two main categories: physiological and stress-inducible. Studies of *Jnk*-knockout (*Jnk*⁻/⁻) mice have revealed roles for JNKs in brain morphogenesis, neuronal pathfinding, axodendritic architecture maintenance and neuronal death after excitotoxic insults (TABLE 1). JNKs have also received considerable attention in the context of neurodegenerative diseases and, more recently, human genetics data have implicated the JNK pathway in the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric disorders¹⁰⁻¹⁵. Here, I review the effects of JNKs on brain development, the adult brain and pathological states, taking into account how compartmental segregation of JNKs in neurons enables them to exert diverse functions. For the purposes of this article, JNK1, JNK2 and JNK3 are referred to as JNK isoforms (that is, being derived from closely related but distinct genes), whereas the splice variants of each JNK will be referred to as splice variants (although strictly they are also isoforms). Throughout, ‘JNK’ and ‘JNKs’ refer to the family of JNK kinases.

**JNK mRNA and protein distribution in the brain**

Three JNK genes are expressed in the human brain, and together they generate ten splice variants that are nearly all either 46 kDa or 54 kDa in size¹ (FIG. 1b). Studies of mRNA in mice have shown that *Jnk1* (also known as *Mapk8*) and *Jnk2* (also known as *Mapk9*) are ubiquitously expressed throughout the body, whereas expression of *Jnk3* (also known as *Mapk10*) is largely restricted to the brain, with low levels of *Jnk3* mRNA also found in the testes¹⁶. The highest levels of *Jnk1*, *Jnk2* and *Jnk3* mRNA are found in the neocortex, closely followed by the hippocampus, thalamus and midbrain. *Jnk1* is developmentally regulated: high levels of *Jnk1* mRNA are expressed in the developing rat brain, and these decline postnatally, although *Jnk1* mRNA levels remain high in the olfactory area throughout adulthood¹⁷. *In situ* hybridization studies in the mouse and rat suggest that *Jnk3* mRNA is the most highly expressed *Jnk* transcript in the adult brain followed by *Jnk2* mRNA and then *Jnk1* mRNA¹⁷,¹⁸.

REVIEW S

The mRNA expression patterns described above correlate with JNK protein levels in rodents¹⁹. A summary of the regional distribution of JNK isoform expression in the adult mouse¹⁹,²⁰ is shown in FIG. 1c. JNK1 and JNK3 show distinct subcellular distributions. JNK3 is prominent in the nuclei of Purkinje and granule cells in the cerebellum and in the nuclei of a subset of neurons (~30%) in layers III and V of the cortex, which harbour projecting pyramidal neurons. By contrast, JNK1 expression dominates in the somal cytoplasmic space and neurofibres (axons and dendrites) in the cortex; it is conspicuously high in the cytosol, particularly in the dendrites, of Purkinje and thalamic neurons²⁰. In the hippocampus, JNK3 expression is found in ~90% of pyramidal layer neurons, whereas JNK1 expression is restricted to the CA3, CA4 and the hilus of the dentate gyrus²⁰. JNK1 expression is largely extranuclear in isolated cerebellar granule neurons, with the 46 kDa isoforms of JNK1 showing the highest levels of expression. The low levels of JNK1 expression that are found in the nuclei of these cells mostly comprise the 54 kDa JNK1 variants²¹. In contrast to JNK1 and JNK3 expression, JNK2 expression is comparatively low in most brain regions and is distributed in both the cytosol and nuclei¹⁹–²¹. Compensatory increases in JNK isoform expression have been reported in *Jnk*⁻/⁻ mice: JNK1 levels are increased in brain tissue from *Jnk2*⁻/⁻ mice, whereas JNK2 levels are increased in the brains of *Jnk3*⁻/⁻ mice¹⁹,²². Data from mice in which individual JNK genes were knocked out suggest that JNK1 activity accounts for most physiological JNK activity in the cortex and cerebellum, whereas JNK3 activity accounts for most JNK activity in the hippocampus and striatum⁹,¹⁹.

Subcellular division of JNK signalling

Neurons are exquisitely complex in their subcellular compartmentalization, hosting not only the generic nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments but also functionally specialized compartments with distinct morphologies and protein compositions (for example, axons, dendrites and dendritic spines).

In the cytoplasm. The cytosolic nature of active JNK in neurons has been emphasized using various methodological approaches. Upon fractionation of forebrain extracts, active JNK separates to the postnuclear membrane fraction, with no trace of active kinase in the soluble fraction⁹. Consistent with this finding, antibodies raised against JNKs in their active state reveal a characteristic punctate staining pattern in peripheral nervous system and CNS neurons, indicating that JNK associates with vesicular structures⁹,²³. Similarly, microporous filter-based separation of neurites and somata showed that active JNK predominates in neurites²⁴. Accordingly, several physiological JNK substrates — namely, the microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) MAP1B, MAP2 and superior cervical ganglion 10 protein (SCG10; also known as STMN2) — reside in the cytoplasm⁶,⁷,²⁵–³⁰ (FIG. 2; see Supplementary information S1 (table)). The recent development of fluorescence resonance energy transfer sensors (FRET sensors) has provided improved

Figure 1 | The JNK cascade and JNK isoform expression in the mammalian brain.
a | JUN amino-terminal kinases (JNKs) belong to a classical mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling cascade. JNKs are activated by dual phosphorylation of the TPY motif within their activation loop by two MAPK kinases (MKKs): namely, MKK4 and MKK7. Various MKK kinases (MEKKs) phosphorylate and thereby activate MKK7 and/or MKK4 (and other MKKs). Indeed, MEKKs comprise an overwhelmingly complex group of signalling molecules¹. MEKK1, MEKK4, MLK1–MLK3, apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1), thousand-and-one amino acid kinase 2 (TAOK2), TRAF2 and NCK-interacting protein kinase (TNIK) and dual leucine zipper bearing kinase (DLK) are all MEKKs that are known to have important functions in the nervous system¹⁵,¹⁰³,¹⁷⁸–¹⁸².
b | In the brain, JNK1, JNK2 and JNK3 are alternatively spliced to yield ten proteins, which nearly all fall into two molecular weight categories of 54 kDa and 46 kDa. The schematic depicts the ten JNK protein products, with homologous protein regions indicated by the coloured blocks. The kinase domain (blue) includes 11 subdomains. Alternative splicing in subdomains IX and X (indicated in light blue) gives rise to α- and β-JNK variants, whereas alternative splicing at the carboxyl terminus yields long (54 kDa) and short (46 kDa) JNK variants. c | An overview of JNK isoform protein expression in the mouse brain¹⁹,²⁰. The subcellular distribution of JNK1 and JNK3 differs in the cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum. In the cortex and hippocampus, JNK1 expression is largely cytosolic and found in the neuropile, whereas JNK3 expression is predominantly nuclear and found in approximately 30% of cells in layers III and V. Of note, JNK3 is the dominant JNK isoform expressed throughout the hippocampus, where it is found in nuclei of approximately 90% of neurons. In the cerebellum, JNK3 is found in nuclei of Purkinje cells and cerebellar granule neurons, whereas JNK1 expression is prominent in the Purkinje cell dendrites. JNK2 expression is similar to JNK1 and JNK3 expression in the cortex, and this isoform is found in both the nuclei and somata of neurons in the hippocampus and cerebellum.

spatial information on catalytic JNK activity$^{31,32}$. These cytosolic reporters confirm that JNK is active in neurites (albeit this finding was in differentiated NIE-115 cells$^{24}$) and they may provide a valuable means to monitor JNK activity with spatial and temporal resolution.

In the cytoplasm, JNKs are partly located with mitochondria$^{33}$. This relationship has been examined in the context of neuronal death, as there is a net increase in mitochondria-localized JNK after exposure to excitotoxic stress$^{34,35}$. This translocation of JNKs to mitochondria facilitates phosphorylation of BH3-only members of the BCL-2 protein family, BIM$_{EL}$ (BCL-2-interacting mediator of cell death extra long) and DP5 (also known as HRK)$^{36-41}$ (Supplementary information S1 (table)), which are essential initiators of programmed cell death following exposure to noxious stimuli. JNK translocation occurs in response to trophic deprivation stress, activation of the p75 neurotrophin receptor and transient focal cerebral ischaemia, and leads to BAX-dependent release of cytochrome $c$ and apoptotic death$^{38,40}$.

The case for JNK being localized in dendritic spines is less clear. JNKs phosphorylate postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95) and AMPA glutamate receptor (AMPAR) subunits$^{42-44}$ (FIG. 2d; see Supplementary information S1 (table)), which are enriched in spines. JNK-interacting protein 3 (JIP3), a scaffolding protein that coordinates JNK activation$^{45}$, is also found in spine heads$^{46,47}$. Nonetheless, a proteomics analysis of PSDs failed to detect JNKs in this compartment, although upstream regulators of these kinases — MINK1 (misshapen-like kinase 1), TNIK (TRAF2 and NCK-interacting protein kinase) and MKK4 (also known as MAP2K4) — were identified$^{48-50}$. Despite this lack of direct evidence that JNKs are active in spines, the functional changes exerted by JNKs at the PSD suggest that a closer look at whether JNKs are present in spines, and their functional impact in this location, may be warranted.

In the nucleus. JNKs are not static in a given cellular compartment; for example, JNK3 translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in pyramidal neurons of the

JNK function in brain development

Brain morphogenesis and developmental death. The phenotypes observed in JNK-knockout mice highlighted the importance of JNK function in the nervous system (TABLE 1). Two research groups simultaneously generated JNK-knockout mice using independent transgenic strategies ${ }^{16,72}$. $Jnk3^{-/-}$ mice show no obvious developmental brain defects and survive normally, but mice lacking both $Jnk1$ and $Jnk2\left(Jnk1^{-/-} Jnk2^{-/-}\right.$ mice) die between embryonic day 11 (E11) and E12 (REF. 16). The $Jnk1^{-/-} Jnk2^{-/-}$ mice fail to complete neural tube closure, displaying an overt exencephaly phenotype. They exhibit region-specific alterations in cell survival, with decreased apoptosis in the hindbrain neuroepithelium just before neural tube closure and increased apoptosis and caspase 3 activation in the forebrain ${ }^{16,72}$ (FIG. 4A). Neurulation involves regulated cell death and proliferation as well as coordinated changes in cell shape and cell movement. No defects in neural crest cell migration were detected in the $Jnk1^{-/-} Jnk2^{-/-}$ mice, but later studies implicated JNKs in the migration of various cell types ${ }^{73}$. Similarly, cell proliferation was unchanged in these mice ${ }^{16,72}$, and the exencephaly phenotype is considered to be a direct consequence of deregulated apoptosis. The neurulation defect was gene-dose-dependent and the presence of only one $Jnk1$ allele was sufficient to maintain viability and an intact neural tube ${ }^{72}$. Of note, compound knockout of $Jnk1$ and $Jnk3$, or $Jnk2$ and $Jnk3$, does not result in neural tube defects ${ }^{16}$. Interestingly, the exencephaly phenotype was not reported upon genetic ablation of $Mkk4$ or $Mkk7$ (also known as $Map2k7$), which encodes an upstream regulator of JNKs, and compound disruption of both of the genes results in severe growth retardation and embryonic lethality at E9.5, before the completion of neurulation ${ }^{74-76}$. However, in flies, disruption of hemipterous (the fly homologue of $MKK7$) results in failed dorsal closure, as does disruption of basket, the JNK homologue ${ }^{77,78}$. Moreover, MKKs of the JNK pathway are known to regulate morphogenic movements during development in a range of organisms. For example, members of this family regulate convergent extension in zebrafish ($Mkk4b$) and Xenopus laevis ($mkk7$) and dorsal ventral patterning in zebrafish ($Mkk4a$) ${ }^{76,79-81}$.

It is striking that among the substrates of JNK (Supplementary information S1 (table)), only one phenocopies $Jnk1^{-/-} Jnk2^{-/-}$ mice when it is genetically deleted. Indeed, mice lacking Jun, the transcription factor target of JNK, die from heart malformations at E12.5, with increased apoptosis in the liver; however, they show no cranial defects ${ }^{82}$. Similarly, mice lacking the JNK target Atf2 undergo normal cranial morphogenesis and survive until birth, after which they die from respiratory failure ${ }^{83}$. Only MARCKS-like protein 1 (MARCKSL1; also known as MacMARCKS), an actin regulatory protein belonging to the GMC family ${ }^{84}$, identified in a screen for novel JNK targets ${ }^{85}$, causes neural tube defects upon knockout. Indeed, genetic deletion of MARCKSL1 results in exencephaly ${ }^{86,87}$. JNK phosphorylates MARCKSL1 at three residues, and this leads to increased actin bundling and retarded migration ${ }^{85}$.


Figure 3 | The nuclear function of JNKs. JUN amino-terminal kinase (JNK) signalling in the nucleus is involved in neuronal stress responses as well as developmental processes. a | Under various stress conditions, active isoforms of JNK in the nucleus induce the AP1 stress response directly or through an increase in the levels of AP1 family of transcription factors from the JUN and ATF family. The AP1-responsive apoptotic death genes mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase 1 (Mkp1), jun D proto-oncogene (Jund), thioredoxin interacting protein (Txnip), Puma (an apoptosis facilitator) and BCL-2-interacting mediator of cell death (Bim) are examples of genes that are upregulated in response to trophic withdrawal stress ${ }^{62}$. JNKs can translocate to the nucleus following certain stresses; for example, JNK3 translocates to the nucleus in response to cerebral hypoxic stress ${ }^{135}$. b | Mkp1 expression is induced by JNKs in response to trophic deprivation stress ${ }^{62}$. MKP1 in the cytoplasm acts to negatively regulate JNK1 catalytic activity and control axon branching during cortical development ${ }^{184}$. c | JNKs regulate chromatin modifiers; for example, JNK2 and JNK3 phosphorylate histone H3 on serine 10, which relaxes chromatin structure ${ }^{67}$. This occurs in differentiating neurons, in which catalytically active JNK1 and JNK3 are found bound to the active promoters for GTPase activating protein binding protein 1 (G3bp1), $Ppp2r$ (protein phosphatase 2 regulatory subunit genes), poly(A) binding protein nuclear 1 (Pabpn1) and TNF receptor-associated factor 2 (Traf2) ${ }^{67}$.

also interacts with the ATAC histone acetyltransferase complex in Drosophila melanogaster and facilitates the expression of JNK target genes under resting conditions but represses their expression following osmotic stress by inhibiting upstream activators ${ }^{71}$. During the differentiation of mouse stem cells to neurons, JNK associates with active promoters enriched with binding motifs for the nuclear transcription factor Y (NFY); surprisingly, this study found little enrichment of JNK at AP1-binding motifs, although JUN and ATF are the best-studied nuclear targets of JNK ${ }^{67}$. The genes bound by JNK in differentiating neurons include those involved in functions such as nervous system development, the cell cycle, gene expression and cell death ${ }^{67}$. It remains to be seen whether chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis using stressed neurons reveals JNK binding at AP1-binding motifs, which would be in support of earlier work indicating that AP1 is a hallmark of neuronal stress ${ }^{53,63,64}$.

Figure 4 | JNK function in brain development. JUN amino-terminal kinases (JNKs) are functional in various stages of brain development, as shown by various knockout and knockdown approaches, which lead to various development defects. A | At embryonic day 9 (E9.0), mice in which both $Jnk1$ and $Jnk2$ are knocked out ($Jnk1^{-/} Jnk2^{-/}$ mice) show reduced death in the hindbrain ${ }^{16,72}$. By E10.5, there is dramatically increased death in the forebrain ${ }^{16,72}$. By E11.5, $Jnk1^{-/} Jnk2^{-/}$ mice show conspicuous hindbrain exencephaly, displaying open neural tubes, and by E12.5 they display protrusion of an enlarged and morphologically abnormal brain. Outside the nervous system, development seems to be normal ${ }^{16,72}$. Ba | Netrin 1, acting via the Down’s syndrome cell adhesion molecule (DSCAM) receptor (not shown), is a chemoattractant that activates JNK in the developing nervous system ${ }^{92}$. This activation is required for midline crossing in the spinal cord. Short hairpin RNA (shRNA) knockdown of $Jnk1$ prevents midline crossing at the floor plate ${ }^{92}$. Bb | In mice lacking the JNK scaffold JNK-interacting protein 3 ($Jip3^{-/}$ mice) (which show reduced levels of basal JNK activity), the axon tracts of the corpus callosum (CC) and the anterior commissure (AC) form; however, in both cases, they fail to cross the midline ${ }^{96}$. In $Jnk1^{-/}$ mice, the AC forms but then degenerates and is lost by postnatal day 12 (P12)), indicating that physiologically active JNK is important for stabilizing this commissure ${ }^{26}$. Ca | Following their final cell division, neuronal progenitor cells undertake a multipolar transition in which they move in random directions in the intermediate zone (IZ) of the developing cortex. After this stage, which lasts over 10 hours, they assume a bipolar form and start to migrate unidirectionally towards the outer surface of the cortex, bypassing the earlier-formed layers. In $Jnk1^{-/}$ mice, cells exit the multipolar phase more quickly and the subsequent bipolar cell movement occurs at an accelerated rate ${ }^{30}$. Accelerated radial migration is also observed upon expression of JNK-binding domain (JBD) ${ }^{76}$. Cb | Cellular organization in the cortical layers is disturbed in $Jnk1^{-/}$ mice: neuronal cells are malpositioned compared with those in wild-type mice and the subplate (SP) is less well defined ${ }^{30}$. This may be the result of faster multipolar phase transition and accelerated bipolar cell movement in $Jnk1^{-/}$ mice. Analogous malpositioning of neurons is observed in the cerebellum upon targeted deletion of Mkk4, the upstream activator of JNK ${ }^{185}$. Da | Dendritic architecture is altered upon interference with JNK signalling. In the cerebellum, dendrite architecture is more complex (owing to an increased number of primary dendrites) in cerebellar granule neurons isolated from $Jnk1^{-/}$ mice or in cerebellar granule neurons expressing the JBD inhibitor of JNK, whereas arbor length is reduced ${ }^{7}$. Db | In the developing cortex, JNK is activated by semaphorin 3A, which signals via neuropilin 1 to the upstream regulator of the JNK cascade, thousand-and-one amino acid kinase 2 (TAOK2). Knockdown of Taok2 with shRNA decreases JNK1 activity and reduces basal dendrite complexity in cortical neurons, whereas overexpression of a constitutively active JNK chimaera (MKK7–JNK) increases basal dendrite complexity ${ }^{15}$. Apical dendrite architecture was unchanged in both cases. CP, cortical plate; MZ, marginal zone; VZ, ventricular zone.

Nuclear JNK has been shown to reside on active promoters in differentiating neurons derived from pluripotent mouse embryonic stem cells, where it directly regulates the transcription of genes involved in brain morphogenesis⁶⁷ (FIG. 3c). Brain development genes regulated in the *Jnk1⁻/⁻* brain include the atypical cadherin *Celsr3* and ulk-51-like-kinase-1 (REF. 30), which function in axon growth and pathfinding⁸⁸,⁸⁹. Thus, JNK regulates processes in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm that are probably crucial for its dominant role in the developing brain.

**Neuronal migration and pathfinding.** Following neurulation, cell proliferation and migration are activated to initiate the next phase of brain development. A large body of evidence from isolated neurons in culture indicates that JNK activity is required for neurite growth⁶,⁹,⁹⁰–⁹². More recent work indicates that as early as E11, JNK regulates axonal pathfinding in the spinal cord⁹²,⁹³. This is triggered by netrin 1, a guidance cue that activates JNK to enable midline crossing (FIG. 4Ba) through a mechanism involving cell adhesion receptors — namely, deleted in colorectal cancer⁹² and Down’s syndrome cell adhesion molecule (DSCAM)⁹², the main mediators of netrin attraction in the nervous system⁹⁴. In the cortex, JNK is activated by the secreted guidance molecule semaphorin 3A via the neuropilin 1 receptor to regulate basal dendrite architecture¹⁵,⁹⁵. Moreover, studies using genetic deletion of JNK-pathway components report a range of axonal anomalies. For example, mice lacking JIP3 display axon guidance defects⁹⁶. JIP3 facilitates JNK activation by recruiting upstream regulator kinases MKK4 and MKK7, and mice lacking *Jip3* display reduced JNK activity in the nervous system⁴⁵. The anterior commissures in these mice deviate from their normal path before reaching the midline at E14.5, and late-arriving callosal axons, which exhibit decreased JNK activity, fail to cross the midline⁴⁵ (FIG. 4Bb). In *Jnk1⁻/⁻* mice, the anterior commissures swell and degenerate shortly after forming, although their initial development seems to be normal²⁶ (FIG. 4Bb), and neurons lacking *Jnk1*, *Jnk2* and *Jnk3* display signs of axonal hypertrophy⁹⁷. Together, these studies provide evidence that, in the developing nervous system, JNKs are activated by various guidance cues and that their activity is required for correct axonal trajectories to be formed and maintained¹⁵,²⁶,⁹²,⁹⁵,⁹⁸. Whether JNKs elicit control of pathfinding through gene regulation or by phosphorylating cytoskeletal targets is not known. It is likely that both mechanisms are important in this process.

The final positioning of neurons in the developing brain reflects a complex programme of coordinated cell division and migration. In the cortex, cells move from their place of birth to their final destination, undergoing two distinct modes of migration. Radial progenitors first undergo multipolar stage movement that is characterized by migration in random directions within the intermediate zone of the developing cortex. This phase is transient, after which cells assume a bipolar morphology and migrate unidirectionally towards the pial surface at a defined speed⁹⁹,¹⁰⁰. There is evidence that JNK1 regulates cell movement during corticogenesis and affects the final positioning of neurons³⁰,¹⁰¹,¹⁰² (FIG. 4Ca,Cb).

An early indication that JNKs may be important regulators of neuronal migration came from studies using the JNK inhibitor JNK-binding domain (JBD) and *Jnk1⁻/⁻* mice³⁰,¹⁰². Following *in utero* electroporation to fluorescently label the embryonic brain with green fluorescent protein (GFP), the authors carried out time-lapse monitoring of multipolar and bipolar cell movements in *Jnk1⁻/⁻* tissues *ex vivo*. They found that in *Jnk1⁻/⁻* brains, the cells spent less time in the multipolar stage, and upon completion of this stage, the bipolar cells in the *Jnk1⁻/⁻* cortex moved faster than those from the wild-type cortex³⁰ (FIG. 4Ca). Similarly, inhibition of JNK in the cytosol through the expression of JBD accelerated radial migration in the developing cortex, supporting the idea that JNK can negatively regulate the movement of neurons¹⁰². By contrast, exogenous expression of a dominant-negative JNK in the developing cortex¹⁰¹ or of a nuclear-targeted JBD³⁰ inhibits radial migration. These distinct outcomes using different inhibitory approaches may reflect the opposing functions of nuclear and cytosolic JNK, or of JNK isoforms, in the regulation of migration. The net impact of JNK on migration in the cortex may ultimately depend on the surrounding extracellular cues. Indeed, in the presence of endothelin, a negative regulator of migration, JNK is required to impede cell movement¹⁰².

Outside the nervous system, a large body of literature concurs that JNK positively regulates cell migration⁷³. One possible explanation for a differing outcome in neurons could be the existence of neuron-specific substrates. For example, ectopic expression of the neuron-enriched JNK substrate MARCKSL1 in fibroblast cells switches the migration phenotype from one in which JNK facilitates migration to one in which JNK inhibits its migration⁸⁵. The existence of neuron-specific JNK substrates (Supplementary information S1 (table)) may define a distinct molecular signature for JNK signalling in the brain.

Upstream regulators of MAPK pathways have also been studied in the context of radial migration. *Mekk4⁻/⁻* mice exhibit highly penetrant neural tube defects, displaying cranial exencephaly and curly-tail phenotypes¹⁰³. It was subsequently shown that radial migration was delayed in the absence of *Mekk4* (REF. 104). However, an important finding from this study was that although the activity of the MAPK p38 was reduced in *Mekk4⁻/⁻* mice, JNK activity was unchanged¹⁰³,¹⁰⁴, indicating that MEKK4 acts upstream of the p38 MAPK pathway rather than upstream of the JNK pathway during brain development. Indeed, resolving the precise roles for effector kinases (p38 versus JNK) from the genetic deletion of upstream MEKKs or MKKs is difficult because of the pathway crosstalk that emanates from MKK4 signalling to both JNK and p38 (REF. 105) (FIG. 1a). The common use of non-specific small-molecule inhibitors of JNKs adds to the challenge of identifying which MAPK, JNK or p38 exerts a given function.

REVIEWS

**Dendrite architecture regulation.** Early analysis of JNK in the nervous system indicated that structurally distinct JNK inhibitors increased primary dendrite number in neurons isolated from the cerebellum⁶. In *Jnk1⁻/⁻* mice, dendrite complexity was increased in the molecular layer of the cerebellum, and cerebellar granule neurons isolated from these mice displayed increased primary dendrite numbers and reduced dendrite length *in vitro*⁷ (FIG. 4Da). Electron microscopy analysis of the cortex and hippocampus of *Jnk1⁻/⁻* mice showed that microtubule integrity was impaired in the dendritic compartment²⁶, and a subsequent study suggested that microtubules may already be altered in the developing neocortex of these mice³⁰. Similarly, in cerebellar neurons, targeted ablation of all three JNK genes altered dendrite architecture¹⁰⁶. Although the precise mechanism is not defined, JNK is thought to mediate its effect on dendrite morphology by phosphorylating its dendrite-specific target MAP2 and, possibly, MAP1B, as the phosphorylation of both of these substrates is reduced in the *Jnk1⁻/⁻* brain¹³,²⁶,²⁷ (Supplementary information S1 (table)).

Extrinsic factors that activate JNK1 to control dendrite shape are starting to be identified. The secreted guidance cue semaphorin 3A is one such factor. It acts via the neuropilin 1 receptor, which interacts with thousand-and-one amino acid kinase 2 (TAOK2) to activate JNK and increase basal dendrite complexity in neurons isolated from the cortex¹⁵ (FIG. 4Db). Receptor-mediated activation of JNK also occurs via the bone morphogenetic protein receptor II (BMPRII) with which JNK1 directly interacts²⁷. BMPRII controls dendrite modelling in many neuron types²⁷. In cortical neurons, BMPRII activates JNK1 to stabilize microtubules and increase primary dendrite number²⁷, whereas in the hippocampus, JNK is activated by the non-canonical WNT pathway to increase dendrite complexity⁹⁸. The final consequence of JNK inhibition, increased or decreased dendrite complexity, thus seems to differ between neuronal cell types (FIG. 4D).

Overall, JNK has emerged as a kinase that affects dendrite structure during development; this role may at least partly explain the association of genetic disruption of the JNK cascade components with psychiatric disorders (see below). However, more questions remain; for example, does JNK affect spine structure?

**JNK function in the adult brain**

**Synaptic plasticity.** Synaptic plasticity, the ability of synapses to strengthen or weaken their responses over time, is central to cognitive function. Critical steps in synaptic plasticity involve NMDA glutamate receptor (NMDAR) activation, calcium influx and recruitment of AMPARs, all of which lead to long-lasting changes in synaptic transmission. JNK is activated by NMDA¹⁰⁷,¹⁰⁸ and, in turn, the JIP scaffold is required for NMDAR function¹⁰⁹. The identified substrates of JNKs include proteins that are important regulators of synaptic plasticity. JNK1 phosphorylates PSD95 on serine 295, causing its enrichment at synapses⁴²,¹¹⁰, where it sequesters cell-surface AMPAR subunits and thereby enhances postsynaptic currents⁴²,¹¹¹ (FIG. 2d). In addition to phosphorylating PSD95, JNK1 phosphorylates the long splice form of the GluR2 AMPAR subunit (GluR2L) and facilitates its insertion at the cell surface in response to NMDAR stimulation⁴³ (FIG. 2d). Surprisingly, however, it is long-term depression (LTD) that is absent in *Jnk1⁻/⁻* mice and in rats treated with the JNK inhibitor SP600125 (REF. 112); long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic current is unchanged in these animals¹¹². Nonetheless, loss of LTD in *Jnk1⁻/⁻* mice may involve PSD95, as mutational inactivation of PSD95 eliminates LTD¹¹⁰,¹¹³. Alternatively, loss of JNK1 regulation of phosphatase expression may be involved, as JNK occupies the active promoter of the protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) regulator subunit PPP2R1A⁶⁷ (FIG. 3c) and PP2A is required during LTD¹¹⁴. However, *Jnk1⁻/⁻* mice¹¹² and JNK inhibitor-treated rats¹¹⁰ exhibit reduced basal synaptic transmission, so decreased neurotransmitter release may also contribute to the absence of LTD. Interestingly, JNK2 is required for late-phase LTP, a mechanism that underlies memory formation²², and for LTP in stressed mice¹¹⁵. The mechanism of JNK2 action in late-phase LTP is not known, but PSD95 and GluR2L may be involved, as they have not been ruled out as targets for JNK2-mediated phosphorylation. Indeed, other, yet-to-be-defined JNK targets presumably also contribute to plasticity changes.

**Protein transport.** Long-range cargo transport is essential for neuronal function. Studies in *D. melanogaster* were the first to highlight a role for JNKs as regulators of motor transport in neurons. In flies, the Basket scaffold Sunday driver (the fly homologue of JIP3) was identified as an adaptor protein that tethered axonal cargo to kinesin light chain¹¹⁶, and later, JIP1 was found to be a cargo adaptor in mammalian cells¹¹⁷. Around the same time, in *Caenorhabditis elegans*, components of the JNK pathway — UNC-16 (the worm JIP3 homologue) as well as JNK and MKK4 homologues — were shown to be necessary for normal protein transport¹¹⁸. In hippocampal neurons, JIP1 is transported from the neurites to the perinuclear region after oxygen glucose deprivation stress. This may contribute to the death mechanism, as neurons lacking *Jip1* are protected from this treatment¹¹⁹,¹²⁰. In peripheral axons, JNK3, kinesin 1 and JIP3 exist in a complex²³. Following axotomy, JNK3 is activated and anterograde transport is disrupted, whereas retrograde transport increases²³, suggesting that JNK3 acts as a surveillance sensor that responds to stress by altering motor transport. Consistent with this indication, mutant huntingtin (mHTT) has been reported to inhibit fast axonal transport through a mechanism involving JNK3, which has implications for Huntington’s disease¹²¹ (see below) (FIG. 5a). JNK is also implicated in regulation of kinesin 1 function under physiological conditions in mammalian neurons, as JNK phosphorylation of JIP1 has been shown to control the directionality of amyloid precursor protein (APP) transport in axons¹²⁰.

**Role in disease**

JNKs can elicit neuronal death in a wide range of pathological contexts, as shown by the numerous reports documenting broad neuroprotection upon treatment with JNK inhibitors or genetic deletion of JNK⁵²,¹²². Early studies using *Jnk3⁻/⁻* mice highlighted JNK3 as a main isoform

Figure 5 | JNK regulates stress responses in the axon. JUN amino-terminal kinase (JNK) has been found to regulate protein transport and protein homeostasis in models of Huntington’s disease and Wallerian degeneration. **a** | Mutant huntingtin (mHTT) — which causes Huntington’s disease — activates JNK3 (REF. 158) and, in turn, JNK3 phosphorylates the kinesin 1 motor domain, which leads to dissociation of kinesin 1 from microtubules (MTs) and impaired axonal transport<sup>121</sup>. **b** | Regulated protein degradation is thought to drive Wallerian degeneration of axons in response to injury. In healthy neurons, superior cervical ganglion 10 protein (SCG10) homeostasis is maintained through a balance of continuous degradation, requiring JNK activity, and transport-mediated replenishing of pools. After axonal injury in peripheral neurons, JNK phosphorylation of SCG10 facilitates its degradation in the distal region of the axon. Injury of peripheral nerves blocks transport and delivery of SCG10 distal to the injury site, leading to degeneration<sup>125</sup>.

protects neurons from NMDA-induced excitotoxicity *in vitro*<sup>25,108,132</sup>, from cerebral ischaemia<sup>108,127,133–135</sup> and from kainate-induced epilepsy in which gliosis is also reduced<sup>136,137</sup>. Even ischaemic preconditioning has been attributed to downregulation of JNK signalling<sup>138,139</sup>. Consequently, JNK has emerged as a central mediator of excitotoxic damage in the nervous system.

Alzheimer’s disease. Alzheimer’s disease is a progressive degenerative disorder of the CNS that is characterized by amyloid-β deposits (plaques) and neurofibrillary tangles<sup>140</sup>. Post-mortem brains from patients with this disease have been shown to display anomalously high levels of JNK activity<sup>141–143</sup>, and preclinical studies using animal models indicate that JNK may markedly affect Alzheimer’s disease pathology by increasing amyloid-β plaque load<sup>106,143</sup> and by hyperphosphorylating tau<sup>129,144,145</sup>. In mouse models of Alzheimer’s disease in which animals express the Swedish mutant variant of APP, from which amyloid-β is derived, and/or harbour a mutation in presenilin 1 (which is involved in APP cleavage), JNK activity is increased<sup>143,146,147</sup>. Application of JNK inhibitors to brain slices from one such model (the Tg2576/PS1<sup>P264L</sup> mouse) *in vitro* reduces degeneration of pyramidal neurons<sup>148</sup>, and chronic administration of a peptide JNK inhibitor to TgCRND8 mice (carrying several mutations in *App*) rescues memory impairment and LTP defects<sup>149</sup>. Moreover, genetic deletion of *Jnk3* in familial Alzheimer’s disease mice decreases amyloid-β plaque load<sup>143</sup>. JNK phosphorylates APP on threonine 668 (REFS 106, 150), a critical event for amyloidogenic processing<sup>151</sup>. Consistent with this, disruption of both *Mkk4* and *Mkk7*, which decreases JNK activity in the cortex by 70%<sup>106</sup>, reduces amyloid-β plaque load in TgCRND8 mice, as does chronic JNK inhibitor treatment<sup>149</sup>. Alongside glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3), p38 and ERK, JNK phosphorylates tau on multiple sites that are hyperphosphorylated in paired helical fragments<sup>144,145,152</sup>. Increased JNK activity has been detected in neurofibrillary tangles in brain tissue from patients with Alzheimer’s disease<sup>153</sup>. Also, in the Tg2576/PS1<sup>P264L</sup> and traumatic brain injury mouse models, JNK activity is increased in tangles, where JNK localizes with phosphorylated tau<sup>146,154</sup>. Of note, a peptide inhibitor of JNK, D-JNKI-1, reduces tau phosphorylation and aggregation<sup>154</sup>.

triggering neuronal death, including in response to exposure to excitotoxic insults<sup>52</sup>, amyloid-β<sup>123</sup>, 6-hydroxydopamine<sup>19,124</sup> or axotomy<sup>19,124</sup>; JNK3 is also implicated in Huntington’s disease<sup>121</sup>. Other JNK isoforms may also contribute to neuronal death. Indeed, neurons isolated from *Jnk3*<sup>−/−</sup> or *Jnk2*<sup>−/−</sup>*Jnk3*<sup>−/−</sup> mice are not protected from trophic withdrawal-induced cell death, whereas small interfering RNA knockdown of all three *Jnk* isoforms imparts notable neuroprotection<sup>28</sup>. Similarly, in the permanent occlusion ischaemia model, genetic deletion of *Jnk2* and *Jnk3* is required to reduce damage in the cortex of mice<sup>19</sup>. Furthermore, JNK is implicated in the axonal degeneration pathway, in which it drives the breakdown of SCG10, which is rapidly lost from the axon after axonal injury<sup>125</sup> (FIG. 5b). Interestingly, pan-JNK inhibitors have shown efficacy in various disease models<sup>126</sup>, and spatial targeting of JNKs has shown promise as a neuroprotective approach<sup>28,127</sup>.

Stroke and epilepsy. Excitotoxic death, a consequence of excessive glutamate receptor stimulation, occurs in stroke, status epilepticus, traumatic brain injury and in various neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease, Huntington’s disease and Parkinson’s disease<sup>128,129</sup>. JNKs are activated by glutamate, the most prevalent excitatory neurotransmitter in the nervous system<sup>130</sup>, through NMDARs and AMPARs<sup>42,43,107,131</sup>. In a landmark study, *Jnk3*<sup>−/−</sup> mice were found to be resistant to kainate-induced seizures<sup>52</sup>. Subsequent studies reported that pharmacological inhibition of JNK

This term refers to the protection rendered by exposure to sequential periods of sublethal ischaemia.

for a biomarker readout of efficacy for Parkinson’s disease and possibly highlights the shortcomings of existing preclinical models of Parkinson’s disease for drug development<sup>157</sup>.

**Huntington’s disease.** Huntington’s disease is caused by HTT that has a polyglutamine expansion (mHTT). JNK is activated by mHTT, and dominant-negative inhibition of JNK protects from mHTT-mediated toxicity<sup>158</sup>. The disease mechanism is associated with JNK3-dependent phosphorylation of kinesin 1, leading to its dissociation from microtubules and inhibition of fast axonal transport<sup>121</sup> (FIG. 5a).

**Psychiatric diseases.** Anomalies in dendrite and synapse structure are a consistent hallmark of neuropsychiatric disorders. New evidence from human genetics studies identified genes associated with the JNK pathway that seem to confer susceptibility to autism spectrum disorders, schizophrenia and intellectual disability<sup>10,12–14</sup>. The genetic basis for these heritable conditions is mostly unknown, making the findings of particular interest. Directly upstream of JNK, a genetic association study identified two single-nucleotide polymorphisms in MKK7 that confer genetic risk for schizophrenia, suggesting that reduced function of JNK may underlie the neurochemical changes and core symptoms of this disorder<sup>12</sup>. Interestingly, one of the polymorphisms was in the 3′ untranslated region of *MKK7* (REF. 12), which targets *MKK7* mRNA to growth cones<sup>24</sup>. This gene is thought to have escaped earlier detection with genome-wide association study approaches because of poor representation on the arrays used in these studies.

In humans, *TAOK2* is located on chromosome 16p11.2, a region that carries substantial susceptibility to autism spectrum disorders<sup>14</sup> and schizophrenia<sup>159</sup>. *TAOK2* was recently shown to account partially for activation of JNK1 in the brain and to regulate basal dendrite formation in the cortex of mice<sup>15</sup>. An additional sign that JNK may have a central role in these disorders comes from study of the gene encoding interleukin-1 receptor accessory protein-like 1 (*IL1RAPL1*)<sup>160</sup>, which is implicated in monogenic forms of mental retardation and autism. *IL1RAPL1* signals through JNK, and mice null for *Il1rapl1* show reduced JNK activity<sup>160</sup>. Finally, gene anomalies in the effector kinase itself have been identified. Chromosomal translocation leading to a loss-of-function truncation of *JNK3* has been identified in cohort and case studies of individuals with intellectual disabilities<sup>10,11,13</sup>.

### JNKs as therapeutic targets

#### Targeting JNKs in neurons.
The pursuit of orally active JNK inhibitors for the treatment of nervous system disorders (cerebral ischaemia, sound trauma, multiple sclerosis and neurodegenerative diseases) has spanned a period of over 10 years. Such inhibitors must be efficiently adsorbed, penetrate the blood–brain barrier and be well tolerated. Several classes of small-molecule, ATP-competitive inhibitors of JNKs have been identified by screening chemical libraries for inhibitors of kinase activity using isotopic labelling, antibody-based assays (ELISAs), time-resolved fluorescence or fluorescence anisotropy measurements<sup>132</sup>. The first reported small-molecule JNK inhibitor was SP600125, an anthrapyrazalone that inhibits JNK1, JNK2 and JNK3 (REF. 161) (inhibition constant is ~0.19 μM). SP600125 is neuroprotective in animal models of stroke, even when administered 1 hour after the initiation of global transient ischaemia<sup>162</sup>, and improves functional recovery after spinal cord injury in mice<sup>163</sup>. However, although SP600125 is commonly used as a JNK inhibitor in preclinical studies, it is not specific<sup>164</sup> — it inhibits 74 kinases (from 353 identified from the KINOMEScan Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures database) at 10 μM. Indeed, delayed treatment with SP600125 at 7 days after occlusion worsens the outcome in a rat model of transient focal cerebral ischaemia, increasing infarct volume and inhibiting vascular remodelling<sup>165</sup>.

Initial JNK inhibitors showed poor bioavailability and had to be administered by intraventricular injections or infusions to achieve effective doses<sup>126</sup>. Compounds with improved oral bioavailability and CNS penetration have been developed. These thiophene-based JNK inhibitors have increased potency (*in vitro* median inhibitory concentration (*IC*<sub>50</sub>) of 0.01–0.04 nM in the presence of 10 μM ATP), improved pharmacokinetic properties and reduced neurotoxicity in an amyloid-β neurotoxicity assay<sup>166</sup>.

The idea that improved neuroprotection could be achieved through selective inhibition of JNK isoforms drove the search for isoform-specific inhibitors, particularly for JNK2 and JNK3 isoforms, which exhibit clear pro-death properties<sup>19,21</sup>. The developed inhibitors included those that showed more than tenfold selectivity for JNK2 and JNK3 over JNK1 (REF. 167) and thiazole compounds that inhibited JNK3 and JNK1 above JNK2 (REF. 168). However, these inhibitors all showed poor CNS penetration *in vivo*<sup>168</sup> despite showing neuroprotection *in vitro*<sup>167</sup>. JNK3-specific aminopyrimidine inhibitors with good CNS permeability and bioavailability were developed, although they also inhibited cytochrome P450, which is important for lipid, hormone and drug metabolism. Thus, they were considered to be non-viable as therapeutics because of anticipated adverse side effects<sup>169</sup>. Recently, structurally similar pyridine-based compounds displaying high potency against JNK3 and good bioavailability were described<sup>170</sup>, and 1-aryl-1H-indazole molecules showing 10–20-fold specificity for JNK3 above JNK1 have also been developed, some of which show improved CNS penetration and pharmacokinetics<sup>171</sup>. Despite the effort to develop isoform-specific JNK inhibitors for CNS disorders, JNK inhibitors that do not distinguish well between JNK isoforms demonstrate the most neuroprotection *in vivo*<sup>126</sup>, consistent with the proposal that all JNKs contribute to neuronal death<sup>28</sup>.

In addition to small-molecule JNK inhibitors, a peptide inhibitor of JNKs (D-JNKI-1) has been developed and extensively studied. D-JNKI-1 exploits a Tat delivery sequence from HIV to cross cell membranes and comprises D-amino acids to confer greater stability against proteolytic cleavage<sup>172</sup>. D-JNKI-1 includes a 20 amino-acid sequence from JIP1. Initial work demonstrated that D-JNKI-1 offered remarkable neuroprotection in
rodent models of ischaemia and inflammation ^{108,132}. Intraventricular administration of D-JNKI-1 at 11 mg per kg, as late as 6 hours after occlusion, reduced infarct volume in the mouse middle cerebral artery occlusion model. The effects lasted for at least 14 days ^{108}. Intravenous injection of a single dose of D-JNKI-1 several hours after ischaemia was also protective in this stroke model and was compatible with the presence of tissue plasminogen activator, suggesting that D-JNKI-1 may be a promising agent for the treatment of stroke ^{173}.

**Inhibition of JNK in particular locations.** Compartment-specific targeting of JNK has been used to selectively block pro-apoptotic JNK action in the nucleus, in the cytoplasm and at mitochondria (TABLE 2; see Supplementary information S2 (figure)). Targeted inhibitors of JNK have been generated by fusing a nuclear export sequence (NES) or a nuclear localization sequence (NLS) upstream of the JNK inhibitor JBD, resulting in constructs with demonstrated selectivity of action in the cytosol and nucleus, respectively ^{7,9}. Thus, in mice, expression of GFP–NES–JBD mimics the knockout

of *Jnk1* in that it causes acceleration of transit in the multipolar stage and radial migration in the developing brain ^{30}, a reduction in neurite growth ^{10} and an increase in dendrite complexity ^{7}. By contrast, inhibition of JNK in the nucleus upon expression of GFP–NLS–JBD does not disrupt these physiological events ^{7,9,30}. Interestingly, however, GFP–NLS–JBD provides substantial protection from neuronal death in response to withdrawal of trophic support ^{28} and death evoked by activation of the p75 neurotrophin receptor ^{174} (FIG. 5). This suggests that the nucleus is a major compartment in which JNK elicits death responses, and gene regulation would seem the probable mechanism by which it acts. In support of this, directing JNK activators to the nucleus increases neuronal toxicity, and structurally distinct nuclear inhibitors protect against toxicity ^{28}. It is notable that a fluorescently labelled Tat–D-JNKI-1 peptide inhibitor of JNK accumulates passively in the nuclei of neurons in the cortex within 1 hour of being intraperitoneally injected into rats ^{175}.

Specific inhibition of JNK at mitochondria has also been another successful targeting approach. JNK is found enriched at mitochondria following excitotoxic stresses, transient middle cerebral artery occlusion and treatment with kainate^{34,35}. A peptide interfering with JNK recruitment to mitochondria has been developed. The cell-permeable peptide corresponding to the kinase interaction motif 1 (KIM1) domain of the mitochondrial JNK scaffold SAB (also known as SH3BP5)^{176} reduces damage in a rat model of neonatal ischaemia^{127}. In HeLa cells, SAB–KIM1 prevents BCL-2 and BCL-X~L~ phosphorylation^{176}, JNK-dependent modifications that antagonize the protective functions of BCL-2 and BCL-X~L~ at mitochondria. However, it is worth noting that although the death function of these proteins is executed in the cytoplasm, the initial trigger for the rapid induction of BH3-only proteins occurs in the nucleus and is dependent on JNK^{38}. Thus, it seems reasonable that targeting of JNK either in the nucleus or at mitochondria may confer protection. Peptide drugs provide the possibility for organelle targeting. Conveniently, in the case of nuclear targeting, the HIV-derived Tat sequence targets passively to nuclei and nucleoli^{175,177}. It therefore seems obvious that delivering a drug directly to its site of action could be a favourable therapeutic strategy.

# Conclusions

JNK emerges from these studies as a key player in the developing and adult brain. Interruption of JNK signalling alters neuronal pathfinding, migration and axodendritic architecture as well as synaptic function. Genetic interference at several levels of the JNK pathway confers susceptibility to psychiatric disease. However, a complete picture of how JNKs coordinate these events is lacking, as many new substrates remain to be identified. If one-third of brain proteins are phosphorylated on proline-directed residues^2, the number of genuine targets for the JNK family of kinases will probably be extensive. These will comprise both gene regulators and extra-nuclear targets that reside in various neuronal subcompartments. Indeed, spatially targeted inhibitors of JNK function may provide a strategy for neuroprotection with fewer unwanted adverse effects.
