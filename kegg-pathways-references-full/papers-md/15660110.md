NATURE AND NURTURE – LESSONS FROM CHEMICAL CARCINOGENESIS

Andreas Luch

Abstract | The roles of genetic constitution versus environmental factors in cancer development have been a matter of debate even long before the discovery of ‘oncogenes’. Evidence from epidemiological, occupational and migration studies has consistently pointed to environmental factors as the major contributing factors to cancer, so it seems reasonable to discuss the importance of chemical carcinogenesis in the present ‘age of cancer genetics’.

Epidemiological data on geographical and temporal variations in cancer incidence, as well as studies of migrant populations and their descendants that acquire the pattern of cancer risk of their new country, indicate that ‘environmental exposures’ make a substantial contribution to human cancers^{1,2}. These studies, along with the investigation of lifestyle factors and habits, led to the conclusion that the great majority (over 80%) of cancer deaths in Western industrial countries can be attributed to factors such as tobacco, alcohol, diet, infections and occupational exposures, with diet (35%) and tobacco (30%) as the major contributors^{1}. In a recent compilation of data, it was estimated that about 75% (smokers) or 50% (non-smokers) of all deaths due to cancer in the United States could be avoided by elimination of these risk factors^{3}.

The view that environmental factors are a principal cause of sporadic cancers was reinforced by analyses of cancer cases in large cohorts of twins from Sweden, Denmark and Finland^{4}, and by analyses of the Swedish family-cancer database, which encompasses about 10 million individuals^{5}. Although heavily debated, the authors of both studies were able to demonstrate that the influence of exposures and factors not shared among siblings or relatives — termed as ‘non-shared environmental factors’ — predominates. For instance, in the family-cancer database these factors accounted for 79% of lung, 77% of urinary bladder, 69–75% of colorectal, and 60% of breast cancer cases. In principle, ‘non-shared environmental factors’ comprise causative factors, such as smoking, radiation, infections and occupational exposures, as well as sporadic mutations. A priori,

sporadic and random mutations have no predictable cause — they might be induced by environmental or genetic factors, or by the interaction of both. What are the roles of chemical carcinogens in the aetiology of cancer, a complex disease that is caused by the interplay of multiple genes and many environmental factors?

Chemical carcinogens — from past to present

Based on his observations in Austrian mines and at several other places throughout Middle Ages Europe, Theophrastus Bombastus von Hohenheim, better known by the name Paracelsus, described the ‘wasting disease of miners’ in 1567 (REF. 6). He proposed that the exposure to natural ores such as realgar (arsenic sulphide) and others might have been causing this condition. A similar disease was noticed in the Erz Mountains of Eastern Europe that was much later known as the ‘lung cancer of the Schneeberg mines’ in Saxony^{7}. Although this kind of cancer was eventually linked to radioactivity emitted from decay products of radon gas, rather than to arsenic^{8}, Paracelsus was actually among the first to consider a chemical compound as an occupational carcinogen.

A more systematic account on the work-related ‘peculiar diseases’ in several different fields was published by Bernadini Ramazzini in 1700 (REF. 9), who could therefore be considered as the actual founder of occupational medicine. Later in the same century, the two English physicians John Hill and Percivall Pott described the occurrence of cancerous alterations in the nasal mucosa and at the skin of the scrotum in a few patients, and traced it to the local long-term exposure

Summary

- Associations between cancer and occupational exposures can be dated back into the sixteenth century.
- Today, about 200 different chemical compounds and mixtures are known or anticipated to be human carcinogens.
- The great majority of human chemical carcinogens require metabolic activation to elicit detrimental effects. The activity of ‘xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes’ such as cytochrome-P450-dependent monooxygenases, glutathione S-transferases, sulphotransferases and others are required for activation (toxication) of important carcinogens.
- Human carcinogens act through a variety of genotoxic and non-genotoxic mechanisms. DNA binding and induction of mutations in cancer-susceptibility genes, such as TP53 and KRAS, are import mechanisms of tumour initiation. In addition, the accompanying ability of many compounds to promote the outgrowth of transformed cell clones has been acknowledged.
- The preferential formation of certain stereoisomers during metabolic activation of genotoxic carcinogens can determine the level of DNA damage, the efficiency of DNA repair, and the carcinogenic potency of a compound.
- Humans are exposed to mixtures of compounds with different degrees of biological activity. Analysis of compound-specific mutational patterns provides valuable clues on the contribution of individual chemicals (or single classes of chemicals) to the overall biological response to these mixtures observed in certain tissues.

to snuff$^{10}$ and to repetitive local contamination by soot$^{11}$, respectively. In 1822, John Ayrton Paris noticed that arsenic fumes (“arsenical vapour”) might contribute to the occurrence of scrotal skin cancer in the copper-smelting works of Cornwall and Wales$^{12}$.

At the end of the nineteenth century it became evident that occupational exposures to certain chemicals or mixtures of chemicals had carcinogenic effects. For instance, Richard von Volkmann and Joseph Bell confirmed the early observation from Pott by describing several scrotal skin tumour cases in the German and Scottish paraffin industry$^{13,14}$. In the late 1880s, the English pathologist and dermatologist Sir Jonathan Hutchinson reported on the occurrence of skin cancer as a result of the medical use of arsenic$^{15}$. In 1895, the surgeon Ludwig Wilhelm Carl Rehn reported the appearance of urinary bladder tumours among men employed in the German aniline dyestuff industry in the production of ‘fuchsin’ (magenta)$^{16}$. This workplace was subsequently associated with frequent occurrence of cancer of the urinary tract, referred to as ‘aniline cancer’.

By the year 1907 it was officially recognized in Great Britain that cancer of any cutaneous site could be caused by pitch, tar or tarry compounds$^{17}$. Until then, physicians were only able to observe unexpected overall effects of occupational exposures, based on the rise of industrialization. The imperative next step was that of systematic inquiry and reproduction of the diseases in experimental systems. After many failures to induce cancer in laboratory animals, the Japanese pathologist Katsusaburo Yamagiwa and his assistant Koichi Ichikawa were the first to produce malignant epithelial tumours by application of coal tar to the ears of rabbits in 1915 (REF. 18). This pioneering experiment actually marked the transition into the modern era of experimental cancer research. During these years, the identification of the carcinogenic compound(s) in these mixtures was extremely difficult, because of their complexity, but success was achieved by Sir Ernest Kennaway and his co-workers at the Royal Cancer Hospital in London (FIG. 1). During this time, chemical synthesis routes for higher molecular weight polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), such as dibenz[$a,h$]anthracene (DBA), were first described and these molecules were subsequently proven to induce skin cancer in mice$^{19,20}$. The active component isolated from 2 tons of coal tar pitch turned out to be another PAH, the pentacyclic benzo[$a$]pyrene (BP)$^{21}$.

Parallel studies with aromatic amines or related compounds supplemented experimental data on the carcinogenicity of industrial chemicals that had been

Figure 1 | Sir Ernest Laurence Kennaway (1881–1958) and his co-workers. In 1930, Kennaway and Hieger showed for the first time that single polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), such as dibenz[$a,h$]anthracene, are tumorigenic in mouse skin$^{19}$. In 1933, Cook, Hewett and Hieger isolated the carcinogen benzo[$a$]pyrene from coal tar pitch$^{21}$. Boyland and Levi proposed in 1935 that toxic PAHs might either be intravitally converted into more active pathogenic substances or detoxified$^{75}$.

released in large amounts during this time. Although aniline and other aromatic amines failed to produce tumours in rabbits²², Hueper and colleagues showed that 2-naphthylamine (2-NA) induced bladder tumours in dogs when administered to the stomach or skin²³. This experiment supported an earlier prediction from Otto Leichtenstern about the tumorigenicity of this compound in the human bladder²⁴. In the meantime, others provided evidence for the hepatocarcinogenicity of aminoazo dyes such as o-aminoazotoluene²⁵ and N,N-dimethyl-4-aminoazobenzene (DAB, ‘butter yellow’) in

rats²⁶. In 1941, the first report on tumorigenesis in bladder, liver, kidney, pancreas and lung of rats induced by 2-acetylaminofluorene (AAF), an arylamide intended to be used as a pesticide, had been published²⁷.

By 1940, evidence for chemical carcinogenesis in humans, initially fuelled from single case observations, had been complemented by experimental data on the bioactivity of pure and structurally defined compounds present in the industrial environment. Today, it is well established that a great diversity of compounds (as pure chemicals or present in mixtures) are tumorigenic in

humans<sup>28</sup>. A few examples from these lists of human chemical carcinogens are compiled in TABLE 1, and the history of carcinogen research is outlined in the TIMELINE.

### Metabolic activation of carcinogens

**DNA binding.** In the pre-Watson and Crick era, before carcinogens were known to bind to DNA, the cancer-producing effects of DAB<sup>29</sup> or BP<sup>30</sup> were believed to be due to their interaction with proteins in specific tissues<sup>31</sup>. Later, when the sensitivity of detection was increased due to the availability of radioactively labelled chemicals, carcinogens such as N-methyl-bis(2-chloroethyl) amine ('nitrogen mustard')<sup>32</sup>, N-nitrosamines (for example, N-nitrosodimethylanine)<sup>33</sup>, PAHs (for example, BP)<sup>34</sup>, aromatic amines/amides (for example, AAF)<sup>35</sup>, and aminoazo dyes (for example, DAB)<sup>36</sup> were found to bind DNA in vivo. By the end of the 1960s, accumulating evidence pointed to a correlation between the DNA-binding capacity of a particular carcinogen and its biological potency. More than two decades after the discovery that mustard gas induced mutations in *Drosophila*<sup>37</sup>, all of these carcinogenic compounds were also regarded as mutagens<sup>38</sup>.

As chemical carcinogens were found to be covalently attached to cellular proteins and DNA, it became obvious that only sufficiently reactive, ELECTROPHILIC, compounds are capable of directly interacting with these macromolecules. Among known human carcinogens, however, only a few chemicals belong to the class of 'direct carcinogens'—for example, ethylene oxide, bis(chloromethyl) ether and some aziridine or nitrogen-mustard derivatives used in anticancer chemotherapy (TABLE 1). Conversely, NUCLEOPHILIC or chemically inert compounds such as aromatic and heterocyclic amines, aminoazo dyes, PAHs, N-nitrosamines, halogenated OLEFINS, and others represent the great majority of human carcinogens. As these chemicals do not react directly with cellular

**Metabolism.** Soon after first characterization of pure chemical carcinogens, the detection of hydroxylated derivatives (and their conjugation products) in the urine of animals treated with 2-NA<sup>39</sup>, DBA<sup>40</sup> or DAB<sup>41</sup> indicated that these compounds are metabolically converted in vivo. In 1948, James A. Miller and co-workers were the first to demonstrate the oxidative metabolism of a carcinogen, DAB, in a cell-free system containing rat liver MICROSOMES<sup>42</sup>. They also provided the first evidence that certain carcinogens, such as PAHs, are capable of promoting their own metabolism through induction of microsomal proteins<sup>43</sup>. At this time it was known that the enzyme(s) present in microsomes were MIXED-FUNCTION OXIDASES<sup>44</sup>, but it was not until the 1960s that CYTOCHROME P450 was discovered<sup>45</sup> and cytochrome-P450-dependent monooxygenases (CYPs) were shown to be associated with an NADPH-dependent reductase<sup>46</sup>.

The initial step during conversion of organic XENOBIOTICS into hydrophilic and excretable derivatives is mainly catalysed by CYP enzymes. At present, 57 genes encoding these enzymes have been identified in the human genome (see ‘Cytochrome P450 Homepage’ in the online links box). The forms of CYP that are most important for activation of carcinogens belong to families 1–3, and display broad and overlapping substrate specificities and tissue-specific expression patterns<sup>47,48</sup>. Whereas **CYP1A1** is the most important form in human lung, **CYP1A2**, **CYP2A6**, **CYP2E1** or **CYP3A4** are mainly expressed in the liver, and **CYP1B1** is expressed in almost all organs except liver and lung<sup>49</sup>.

BIOTRANSFORMATION of carcinogens proceeds through intermediates that are capable of undergoing subsequent transferase-catalysed conjugation to polar molecules such as glutathione by glutathione S-transferases (GST), to glucuronic acid by glucuronosyltransferases,

pathways in animals are similar to those of humans²⁸. In addition, limited epidemiological evidence for TCE-induced carcinogenicity in human organs such as the liver and kidney has been reported⁵⁵. Mechanistically, there is considerable evidence for the formation of genotoxic GSH conjugates from VICINAL DIHALOALKANES (GSH episulphonium electrophiles)⁵⁶, and for the kidney-specific cysteine conjugate β-lyase-dependent formation of genotoxic thioketenes, which contribute to the toxicity of haloalkenes in this tissue⁵⁷ (FIG. 2).

### Carcinogenic mechanisms

Despite the proof that most chemical carcinogens undergo metabolic conversion into DNA-reactive intermediates, some compounds do not bind to DNA and are not mutagenic, yet they are carcinogenic in animal models and possibly also in humans. An overview of the various modes of action of chemical carcinogens is presented in FIG. 3. What are some of the important non-genotoxic mechanisms?

#### TCDD

The non-genotoxic human carcinogen 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) is a by-product of the manufacture of polychlorinated phenols that is inadvertently generated through waste incineration²⁸. Both epidemiological evidence and mechanistic studies have indicated a relationship between exposure to this chemical and the occurrence of a range of cancers⁵⁸. For example, in 1976, about 3,000 kg of chemicals, including up to 20 kg of TCDD, were released into the air in Seveso, Italy after a pipeline burst at a herbicide-producing plant. More than 30,000 people were exposed to these chemicals, and decades later cancer rates among those exposed were significantly increased compared with control populations. Numerous animal studies supported this view and confirmed TCDD-mediated carcinogenicity in various organs such as the liver, thyroid, lung, adrenal cortex, skin and lymph nodes⁵⁹ In addition, this compound is a potent tumour promoter in liver and skin.

TCDD is the strongest agonist of the arylhydrocarbon receptor (AhR)⁶⁰, a ubiquitous cytosolic protein originally discovered in connection with PAH-mediated induction of microsomal aryl hydroxylase (AHH) activity⁶¹. This induction of AHH activity, which occurs when cells are exposed to TCDD, PLANAR PAHs such as BP, and polychlorinated biphenyls, is mediated by the AhR protein⁶² (FIG. 4). The AhR belongs to the basic helix-loop-helix/PAS family of transcription factors⁶³. Upon binding to one of its ligands, the complex translocates into the nucleus, heterodimerizes with AhR nuclear translocator, and then binds to specific xenobiotic-responsive elements (XREs; 5'-TNGCGTG-3'). Binding to XRE allows this complex to regulate the transcription of genes that encode a diverse set of proteins, including enzymes involved in xenobiotic metabolism, such as CYP1A1, CYP1B1, CYP1A2 and several GST isoforms⁶⁴.

This process has been meticulously characterized, yet induction of xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes,

or to small residues such as sulphate by sulphotransferases (SULT) and acetic acid by N-acetyltransferases (NAT). Unfortunately, activation into highly electrophilic intermediates also leads to covalent interaction with cellular macromolecules such as proteins or DNA (FIG. 2).

Although enzymes such as SULT, NAT and GST were originally thought to be involved only in detoxification steps of biotransformation, they can also contribute to the activation of certain procarcinogens in vivo. SULT and NAT enzymes catalyse sulphonation and acetylation of nucleophilic metabolites, whereas GST enzymes interact with electrophiles through the reactive cysteinyl residue in their cofactor glutathione (GSH). By the early 1960s, the importance of SULT and NAT in the conversion of carcinogens had been recognized. At this time, CYP-mediated N-hydroxylation was discovered to be the initial step in AAF-mediated liver carcinogenesis⁵⁰. N-hydroxy-AAF was found to have greater carcinogenic activity than its mother compound⁵¹, even though it was unable to directly interact with DNA. Later, N-hydroxy-AAF was shown to undergo SULT-catalysed esterification into the ultimate, genotoxic form N-sulphoxy-AAF⁵² (FIG. 2). It is now well known that N-hydroxy derivatives of procarcinogenic arylamines/amides, aminoazo dyes or heterocyclic amines are converted by NAT or SULT enzymes into highly reactive ester intermediates in vivo that bind to DNA through release of aryl nitrenium ions⁵³.

Although GST-mediated detoxification of reactive metabolites such as epoxides (from PAHs, olefines or aflatoxins) had been widely acknowledged since the early 1960s⁵⁴, recent evidence points to the ability of GST enzymes to directly activate certain industrial chemicals. These include haloalkanes such as 1,2-dichloroethane and haloalkenes such as trichloroethylene (TCE; TABLE 1). These compounds are anticipated to be human carcinogens based on cancer studies in animals and the observation that biotransformation

Activation of aflatoxin B₁ (AFB₁), 2-acetylaminofluorene (AAF), and benzo[a]pyrene (BP) requires the activity of cytochrome-P450-dependent monooxygenases (CYPs). CYP3A4 activates AFB₁ at its 8,9-bond, resulting in the AFB₁ exo-8,9-oxide. The endo-diastereomer is not formed by CYP3A4, but might be formed in small amounts by CYP1A2. AAF is converted by CYP1A2 into N-hydroxy-AAF, which subsequently might undergo sulphotransferase (SULT)-catalysed esterification into the ultimate genotoxic form, the N-sulphoxy-AAF. BP is initially converted mainly by CYP1A1 or CYP1B1 into the 7,8-epoxide. This epoxide is a substrate of microsomal epoxide hydrolase (mEH), which produces the 7,8-dihydrodiol. Both reactions together stereoselectively form the R,R-dihydrodiol. Further epoxidation at the vicinal double bond catalysed by CYP1A1, CYP1B1 and CYP3A4 generates the ultimate genotoxic diol-epoxide of BP (BPDE). Of the four possible resulting diastereomers, the (+)-anti-BPDE is formed at the highest levels. 1,2-Dichloroethane (DCE) is activated by glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) into glutathione (GSH) half-mustard and GSH episulphonium electrophiles, which can bind directly to DNA. GST-catalysed conjugation of trichloroethylene (TCE) produces GSH adducts. Cleavage of the terminal amino acids by γ-glutamyltransferase (γ-GT) and cysteinylglycine dipeptidase (DP) activity give rise to cysteine (Cys) adducts that can be converted into genotoxic thioketenes by the kidney-specific cysteine conjugate β-lyase. The red arrows point to the position of the nucleophile (DNA, protein, GSH) attack. GSH conjugates of AFB₁ oxide or PAH diol-epoxides are detoxification products.

through TCDD-mediated AhR activity, is insufficient to explain its great variety of *in vivo* toxic effects, such as immunosuppression, teratogenicity and tumorigenicity. On the other hand, homozygous deletion of the *Ah* gene locus renders mice resistant to the entire spectrum of TCDD-mediated toxicities⁶⁵, including the occurrence of early lesions in liver, lung and various other organs⁶⁶. Conversely, a constitutively active form of the AhR can induce tumour formation in the glandular part of the stomach⁶⁷ and promote liver carcinogenesis in mice⁶⁸. Recent studies have indicated that the biological effects induced by TCDD through AhR binding are mediated by the activation or inhibition of numerous proteins involved in cell and tissue homeostasis, such as factors that regulate cell growth, proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis⁶⁹,⁷⁰ (FIG. 3). Microarray analysis of gene-expression patterns in human hepatoma HepG2 cells revealed that the levels of at least 112 (REF. 71) or 310 (REF. 70)

mRNAs were significantly up- or downregulated after the exposure to TCDD. For example, CYP1A1 expression was upregulated 12–16-fold. This primary response included changes in expression levels of proteins involved in cellular proliferation (serine/threonine kinases such as COT and NEK2, proto-oncoproteins such as KRAS, and guanine nucleotide exchange factors); cell-cycle regulation and apoptosis (cyclin B2, tumour-necrosis factor receptors, and heat-shock proteins); or extracellular-matrix turnover, signalling and cell adhesion (human enhancer of filamentation 1, metallothioneines and plasminogen activator inhibitors)⁷⁰,⁷¹. AhR-ligand complexes also control signalling networks such as those triggered by hormones (oestrogen receptor-α), hypoxia (hypoxia-inducible factor-1α; HIF1α), or protein kinases (SRC) — either through molecular crosstalk at DNA-binding sites or direct protein-protein interactions⁷²,⁷³.

(BP), Sims et al. proposed that a secondary metabolite, the 7,8-dihydrodiol 9,10-epoxide (vicinal ‘diol-epoxide’), is actually the chemical species that covalently interacts with DNA<sup>77</sup> (FIG. 2). Subsequent work confirmed the central role of diol-epoxide metabolites in mediating the DNA-binding activity of BP and other carcinogenic PAHs. As they were also confirmed to be highly mutagenic and carcinogenic, diol-epoxides are regarded to be the ultimate metabolites in the initiation of PAH tumorigenesis<sup>78</sup>. It is well established that PAHs would not be carcinogenic if they were not metabolized by subsequent steps of EPOXIDATION and hydrolysis. Disruption of genes that encode enzymes and factors that are involved in this activation route, such as CYP1B1, microsomal epoxide hydrolase (mEH) or AhR, renders mice resistant to the biological effects of BP and others<sup>78,79</sup>.

Many potent PAHs act as ‘complete carcinogens’ in mice when repeatedly applied over a prolonged time period<sup>74</sup>. Such compounds can induce both somatic mutations in crucial genes through DNA binding (tumour ‘initiation’ phase) and subsequent outgrowth of irreversibly transformed cells (tumour ‘promotion’ phase). In the early 1980s, carcinogenic PAHs were shown to induce activating Hras mutations in the skin of mice<sup>80</sup>. Although oncogenic RAS constantly promotes cellular proliferation through multiple signalling pathways, repeated application of carcinogenic PAHs is required for maximal tumour induction. As the AhR protein is indispensable for PAH-mediated tumorigenesis<sup>81</sup>, it might be reasonable to assume that not only the initiating activity (through induction of metabolizing enzymes), but also the promotional activity of carcinogenic PAHs in skin depends on AhR-mediated gene expression (FIG. 4). This, of course, is not experimentally confirmable in the case of genotoxic PAHs, yet it would be in agreement with the tumour-promoting activity of TCDD in this organ. On the other hand, autoxidation of metabolically generated PAH phenols or PAH-induced tissue inflammation and concomitant recruitment of polymorphonuclear leukocytes are major sources of reactive oxygen species such as hydroxy or superoxide anion radicals<sup>78</sup>. These short-lived species induce a plethora of additional DNA modifications and modulate the expression of several genes involved in signal-transduction pathways that regulate proliferation at the tumour-promotion stage of carcinogenesis<sup>82</sup>.

Arylamines/amides. After the initial work with 2-NA, it was shown that other aromatic amines, such as 4-aminobiphenyl (ABP) or the arylamide AAF consistently induced formation of bladder tumours in dogs, but only occasionally in rodents<sup>83</sup>. Whereas the primary amines are known human bladder carcinogens, according to the evidence from cancer cases, AAF is only a suspected human carcinogen<sup>28</sup> (TABLE 1). In rodent tumour models, all of these compounds primarily induce tumours in the liver, lung or mammary gland, because of a high rate of N-hydroxylation in rodent liver cells. By contrast, humans and dogs primarily produce N-glucuronides in the liver, which are then

PAHs. In contrast to TCDD, carcinogenic PAHs require metabolic activation to elicit their detrimental effects. Although first isolated from coal tar, incomplete combustion of virtually any organic material can lead to the formation of PAHs. These compounds are therefore pervasive in the human environment<sup>74</sup>. The National Toxicology Program listed 15 individual PAHs as “reasonably anticipated to be human carcinogens” based on evidence from animal experiments<sup>28</sup>. PAH-containing mixtures such as coke-oven emissions, coal tar, pitch, soot or cigarette smoke are categorized as known human carcinogens based on epidemiological evidence for lung and skin cancer in workers exposed to these mixtures and lung cancer in smokers.

Working on the urinary metabolites of anthracene, Eric Boyland and Alfred A. Levi (FIG. 1) proposed in 1935 that toxic PAHs might either be intravitaly converted into more active pathogenic substances or detoxified<sup>75</sup>. About 20–25 years later, epoxides were shown to be involved in this process<sup>76</sup>. Based on the observation that the enzymatically activated 7,8-dihydrodiol of BP binds to DNA with a higher affinity than its parent compound

established in the tissue before the clonal outgrowth of pre-neoplastic cells, this non-genotoxic effect contributes to the selection of resistant cells and hence to the tumour-promoting activity of AAF in liver.

Epigenetics. Based on their potency in inducing a p53-mediated DNA-damage response, GENOTOXIC CARCINOGENS can be distinguished from non-genotoxic carcinogens through expression profiling⁸⁷. However, from the foregoing section it can be concluded that long-term exposure to low doses of genotoxic carcinogens also contributes to non-genotoxic alterations that promote the outgrowth of transformed cell clones *in vivo*. At early stages of tumorigenesis these non-genotoxic effects are reversible and require continuous presence of the compound. On the other hand, changes in gene-expression patterns caused by epigenetic alterations such as DNA methylation or histone acetylation have been observed in cells exposed to the metals nickel (Ni) and cadmium (Cd), or to the metalloid arsenic (As)⁸⁸. Ionic Ni, Cd and As, along with their compounds, are established human carcinogens²⁸ (TABLE 1). All three of these inorganic carcinogens induce chromosome and DNA damage through a variety of mechanisms such as interference with DNA-repair processes and cell-cycle control⁸⁹⁻⁹¹, or generation of reactive oxygen species⁹². In addition, metal-induced stimulation of cellular proliferation through signalling pathways and transcription factors such as extracellular-regulated kinases, NF-κB, HIF1α and MYC has been described⁹³⁻⁹⁵. There is now further evidence that Ni carcinogenicity also involves DNA hypermethylation⁹⁶ and histone deacetylation⁹⁷, both of which contribute to heterochromatin condensation and the epigenetic silencing of tumour-suppressor genes such as CDKN2A/INK4A (REF. 98) or fragile histidine triad gene⁹⁹. By contrast, the requirement of methyl groups in the metabolism of arsenic decreases intracellular methyl donor pools and causes aberrant overexpression of oncoproteins such as MYC, cyclin D1 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen¹⁰⁰ through global genome hypomethylation¹⁰¹.

Molecular specificity

The great majority of genotoxic carcinogens induce DNA damage and mutations in genes involved in the regulation of cellular growth, proliferation and death (FIG. 3). The principal DNA-damaging chemical species generated during biotransformation of several groups of carcinogens are shown in FIG. 2.

DNA affinity. Working on a small number of carcinogenic PAHs, Brookes and Lawley proposed in 1964 that “the DNA binding of these compounds shows a significant positive correlation with carcinogenic potency”³⁴. So, the higher the level of DNA binding, the greater the potency of a chemical carcinogen? Today, numerous test systems enable a simple and fast characterization of the genotoxicity of carcinogens and the identification of their ultimate DNA-reactive metabolites. In mammalian cells, vicinal diol-epoxides from PAHs have been proven to exert extraordinarily strong mutagenic effects compared

transported to the kidney. In the acidic environment of the urine, the amines are again released and subsequently converted into genotoxic derivatives in bladder epithelial cells⁸³. N-hydroxylation and subsequent sulphonate or acetoxy ester formation have been studied in detail and can sufficiently explain the genotoxicity of these compounds⁸³,⁸⁴ (FIG. 2).

On the other hand, additional tumour-promoting activities were reported for AAF, indicating that it acts as a ‘complete carcinogen’ in rodent liver⁸⁵. Chronic exposure of rats to AAF triggers adaptive responses in mitochondria permeability transition pores and BCL2 expression levels of hepatocytes that increase resistance to apoptosis⁸⁶. There is evidence that this effect, which was fully reversible, is an early tissue response to the presence of reactive oxygen species that are generated through oxidation–reduction cycling of AAF metabolites such as 2-nitrosofluorene. As mitochondrial resistance is

with other metabolites from the same compounds<sup>102</sup>. Although PAH diol-epoxides vary considerably in their bioactivity, the level of mutations induced is quantitatively related to the level of diol-epoxide-DNA ADDUCTS at earlier time points. Furthermore, the tumorigenicity of different PAHs was found to correlate with DNA adduct levels induced in lung tissue<sup>103</sup>. Both the relationship between the DNA-binding level and mutagenicity, as well as the correlation between the overall DNA binding and carcinogenicity observed in mice, indicate that

**Box 1 | Stereoselective activation of benzo[a]pyrene**

Benzo[a]pyrene (BP) theoretically can be metabolized into four different 7,8-diol-9,10-epoxide stereoisomers (see figure). The (+)-anti-7R,8S-diol-9S,10R-epoxide of BP [(+)-anti-BPDE] is formed in great excess, both *in vitro* and *in vivo*, compared with the other three stereoisomers, the (+)-syn-, (−)-syn- and (−)-anti-BPDE. (+)-Anti-BPDE derives from further epoxidation of the R,R-dihydrodiol precursor, as shown in FIG. 2. Some small amounts of the (+)-syn-BPDE isomer are usually detectable as a result of further epoxidation of the S,S-dihydrodiol precursor (not shown). From all four possible stereoisomers, the (+)-anti-BPDE has the highest intrinsic genotoxic and carcinogenic potency. The major DNA adduct, the (+)-trans-anti-BPDE-N<sup>2</sup>-dG, derives from trans opening of the epoxide moiety. This adduct is more resistant to nucleotide excision repair than the *cis*-opened product, (+)-cis-anti-BPDE-N<sup>2</sup>-dG. Resistance to DNA repair and subsequent DNA replication across this ‘bulky’ DNA adduct — translesional synthesis (TLS) — can lead to the induction of G→T base pair transversions in cancer genes such as TP53 or KRAS.

![Chemical Structures](https://i.imgur.com/1234567.png)

DNA adduct formation is an important bioindicator of the cancer risk resulting from exposures to carcinogenic PAHs, and possibly to other genotoxic carcinogens<sup>104</sup>.

**Stereochemistry.** Enzymes involved in biotransformation of carcinogens operate with high regio- and stereoselectivity, and the metabolites formed can differ tremendously in their biological activity. An example of this is the CYP-mediated conversion of aflatoxin B<sub>1</sub> (AFB<sub>1</sub>), a potent natural carcinogen that has been linked to human liver cancer<sup>105</sup> (TABLE 1). Epoxidation of the olefinic bond at position 8,9 generates the ultimate carcinogenic intermediate<sup>106</sup>. Although the epoxide ring can be introduced from both sides of the furanocoumarine ring system, CYP3A4, the most important enzyme involved in AFB<sub>1</sub> activation in human liver, exclusively forms the exo isomer<sup>107</sup> (FIG. 2). As the spatial configuration of the epoxide moiety in the DNA–AFB<sub>1</sub> exo-8,9-oxide intercalation complex promotes the attack of the base, this isomer is about 1,000 times more genotoxic than its *endo* DIASTEREOMER<sup>108</sup>.

Similarly, metabolic activation of PAHs is highly selective. For BP, initial conversion at position 7,8 produces the R,R-dihydrodiol in high ENANTIOMERIC excess (FIG. 2). Subsequent epoxidation at position 9,10 then predominantly generates the diol-epoxide with ‘R,S,S,R’-configuration — the (+)-anti-BP-7,8-diol-9,10-epoxide [(+)-anti-BPDE]<sup>109</sup>. This isomer is the most potent mutagenic and carcinogenic species among all four diol-epoxide diastereomers that can be produced at this molecule region (BOX 1). Accordingly, BP-induced DNA damage predominantly results from covalent interaction of the (R,S,S,R) diol-epoxide with 2′-deoxyguanosine (dG) residues through *trans* opening of the epoxide moiety<sup>110,111</sup>. If not repaired, the resulting (+)-trans-anti-BPDE-N<sup>2</sup>-dG adduct can induce mutations, such as G→T transversions, during DNA replication.

‘Bulky’ DNA lesions such as those resulting from PAH diol-epoxides are subject to the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway<sup>112</sup>. It has been shown that (+)-anti-BPDE induces a different degree of NER activity depending on the way that the epoxide ring opens during adduct formation (*cis* versus *trans*)<sup>113</sup>. Whereas the (+)-cis-anti-BPDE-N<sup>2</sup>-dG adopts an intercalative conformation with concomitant displacement of the modified base, the (+)-trans-anti-BPDE-N<sup>2</sup>-dG displays an external conformation with the benzo[a]pyrenyl moiety accommodated in the minor DNA groove<sup>114</sup>. The local DNA distortion induced by the *cis* product is therefore much more severe and results in a 10 times faster removal through NER as compared with the *trans* product (BOX 1). In addition, poor enzymatic repair is preceded by an insufficiently activated DNA-damage checkpoint<sup>115</sup>. Analyses of the cell cycle and expression profiles revealed that the p53/p21-mediated G1 checkpoint was rarely activated, even at DNA-damage levels of about 180,000 anti-BPDE-DNA adducts/cell<sup>116</sup>. Both the lack of activation of cell-cycle arrest and insufficient adduct repair increase the likelihood of transforming mutations, because DNA replication continues from the damaged template<sup>117</sup> (BOX 1).

Mutation profiles. Mutations in RAS that impair its GTPase activity are commonly detected in human cancers and in animal models of chemical carcinogenesis<sup>118,119</sup>. In human bronchial epithelial cells it was shown that DNA-damaging metabolites of various carcinogens such as BP (anti-BPDE), AAF (N-acetoxy-AAF), and AFB<sub>1</sub> (AFB<sub>1</sub> 8,9-oxide) preferentially bind to dG residues within codon 12 of KRAS<sup>120</sup>. This site is most frequently mutated in human cancers including lung adenocarcinomas<sup>121</sup>. As compared to other sites, the ‘hot spot’ characteristic of codon 12 in lung cells is the combined result of the preferential binding of carcinogenic metabolites to this site and the inefficient repair of the resulting DNA adducts<sup>120</sup>. Although methylation at CpG sites in the vicinity of codon 12 of KRAS had no influence on the preferential binding of carcinogens at this position<sup>122</sup>, the presence of 5-methylcytosines greatly increased the binding of the ultimate genotoxic descendants of BP, ABP, AAF and AFB<sub>1</sub> at dG residues within the DNA-binding domain of the human TP53 gene<sup>123–125</sup>.

Analysis of the binding profiles of N-hydroxy-ABP and anti-BPDE at the TP53 locus in human bladder<sup>126</sup> and bronchial epithelial cells<sup>127</sup>, respectively, provided strong evidence for a role of these compounds in cancer initiation. In both cases, the codons (157, 248, 273) and the positions within the codons affected by N-hydroxy-ABP or anti-BPDE matched the TP53 mutations reported to be associated with human bladder or lung cancer. In congruence to the strand bias of G→T transitions associated with lung cancer of smokers, anti-BPDE-N<sup>2</sup>-dG adducts were almost exclusively formed at methylated CpG dinucleotides of the non-transcribed DNA strand, possibly as a result of the slow repair of this strand compared with its transcribed counterpart<sup>128</sup>.

### Assessing human cancer risk

The correlation between DNA-damage level and carcinogenic potency indicates that differences in the activity of enzymes that produce or detoxify DNA-reactive intermediates, or that repair the resulting DNA lesions, can influence individual cancer risk. However, the knowledge obtained from studies with single compounds in cancer models is limited — none of the known xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes, including polymorphic variants, have strictly pro-tumorigenic or anti-tumorigenic effects. Some enzymes that contribute to inactivation (detoxication) of one compound contribute to the toxicity of others. For example, GST enzymes have a detoxifying effect on PAH diol-epoxides, but they toxify haloalkanes/alkenes. One particular enzyme can also be involved in toxification and detoxification routes of the very same carcinogen, as mEH is involved in both the toxification and detoxification of PAHs.

Furthermore, humans are exposed to complex mixtures of compounds, rather than to single carcinogens. For instance, cigarette smoke contains about 60 known carcinogens from a variety of chemical classes including BP, ABP, 2-NA<sup>129</sup>, and traces of metal ions such as Ni, As and Cd<sup>130</sup>. As most laboratory studies have been conducted with single compounds, results cannot be directly extrapolated to the effects of mixtures. Multiple interactions between individual compounds can have additive, synergistic or antagonizing effects. At the level of DNA repair, for example, co-exposure of cells to Ni ions enhances BP-mediated mutagenesis through inhibition of NER of anti-BPDE-N<sup>2</sup>-dG adducts<sup>131</sup>. Also, the presence of structurally different lesions in the same DNA can inhibit repair, through sequestration of NER subunits by those modifications that are more repair resistant<sup>132</sup> (FIG. 4). Finally, the doses of carcinogens shown to induce cancer in animal models are very high, compared with typical levels of human exposure. Because of the unpredictability of the biological responses to carcinogens at incrementally low doses and because of species-specific effects, the way in which toxicologists extrapolate dose-response relationships from animals to humans is highly controversial<sup>133,134</sup>.

### Future directions

Based on the hypothetical assumption that single DNA lesions can induce tumour-promoting gene mutations, no safe threshold values can currently be defined for genotoxic carcinogens. However, zero-level exposures are unrealistic for most carcinogens. Background levels

**Box 2 | Identification of a compound’s mode of action and individuals at risk**

The availability of genome-scale DNA sequence information, along with the development of cDNA and oligonucleotide microarray technology, has allowed researchers to study the effects of biohazards on cell- and tissue-specific gene-expression profiles in experimental animals and humans. Using microarray analysis, expression patterns of up to 10,000 genes can be determined from cells exposed to single compounds or mixtures. These studies have provided valuable information about the mechanisms of chemical agents in various biological systems. Using this ‘toxicogenomics’ approach, it is possible to obtain the gene-expression signatures for prototypic classes of toxicants that act through particular mechanisms and pathways, such as responses mediated through the arylhydrocarbon receptor. Signatures can also be compared, to determine mechanisms of unknown test compounds or mixtures. In cancer toxicology this technique might be used to quickly and efficiently assess exposures and to identify possible adverse effects of as yet unknown xenobiotics. This approach can also be used to identify precursors/pathways without the need for deciphering every detail of activation and detoxification routes. Moreover, it also allows for the identification of compound-mediated complex networks of additional gene–gene interactions that might be related in the broad-ranging interactive and tissue-specific biological outcomes observed. Most intriguing, however, are the possible applications in identifying individuals who are at risk of developing cancer in response to exposure to certain carcinogens. This study of interindividual variability in response to chemical exposures, based on genetic polymorphisms, is termed ‘toxicogenetics’<sup>138,139</sup>.

of carcinogen–DNA adducts in human tissue samples from normal individuals were found to be in the range of 1 per 10<sup>7</sup> to 0.2 per 10<sup>8</sup> nucleotides<sup>135</sup>. Improving our understanding of the mechanisms of carcinogenic genotoxicity and the repair of such lesions (FIG. 3) will help us to determine the minimal levels of exposure that are required for adverse effects to occur, and to set reliable and acceptable concentration thresholds in the human environment<sup>136,137</sup>. At present, however, this goal only refers to single compounds. By far the greatest challenge will be to characterize the synergistic effects of complex mixtures. This is an important problem, as any risk assessment based on toxicological monitoring of only a few well-studied compounds is highly prone to misjudgement.

Similarly, any risk assessment that does not consider inter-individual variability in susceptibility to DNA damage following carcinogen exposure could also underestimate the risk to those individuals who are most vulnerable. Therefore, it is important to identify individuals who are ‘at risk’ of carcinogenic effects, by means of toxicogenomics, toxicogenetics and molecular epidemiology (BOX 2)<sup>138,139</sup>. In this regard, we need to learn much more about the role and interplay of susceptibility and resistance genes targeted by human carcinogens or involved in modulating human responses to carcinogenic compounds. Beyond the range of known polymorphic enzymes that contribute to activation and excretion of carcinogens<sup>140,141</sup>, as well as to DNA repair, it seems reasonable to assume that a great variety of additional low-penetrance genetic variants determine sporadic cancer risk, through interaction with environmental factors that include chemical carcinogens<sup>142</sup>. These gene–environment interactions clearly deserve further attention as they could be sensitive and specific determinants of cancer incidence.
