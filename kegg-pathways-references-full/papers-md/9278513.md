20. A recombinant baculovirus encoding GST fused to S. pombe Chk1 was generated by inserting the fission yeast chk1 gene into pGEX2TN followed by cloning of GST-chk1 into pFASTBAC1. Virus was generated as described by the manufacturer (Gibco-BRL). Recombinant GST-Chk1 kinase was isolated from infected Sf9 insect cells on glutathione (GSH) agarose. Cdc25C was cloned into pET15b (Novagen) and purified as a soluble hexahistidine (His₆) fusion protein as outlined by the manufacturer. GST fused to amino acids 200 to 256 of Cdc25C [GST-Cdc25C(200–256)] was isolated as described (2). Kinase reactions contained GST-Chk1 bound to GSH agarose and either His₆-Cdc25C or GST-Cdc25C(200–256) in a buffer consisting of 50 mM tris (pH 7.4), 10 mM MgCl₂, 10 μM adenosine triphosphate (ATP), 1 mM DTT, and 10 μCi of [γ-³²P]ATP. Reactions were analyzed directly or were first centrifuged to isolate supernatant and pelleted fractions. Radiolabeled proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and visualized by autoradiography. The nitrocellulose membrane containing radiolabeled His₆-Cdc25C was excised and treated as described (5). Further digestion on selected HPLC fractions was performed with 2 units of proline-specific endopeptidase (ICN) in 0.1 M sodium phosphate, 5 mM EDTA (pH 7.4) at 37°C for 16 hours. Reactions were acidified in 1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and loaded onto a Vydac C18 column (25 cm by 0.46 cm inner diameter). Reverse-phase HPLC was performed at 37°C. Reactions were loaded in 0.1% TFA (buffer A) and eluted with a gradient from 0 to 60% buffer B (90% acetonitrile, 0.095% TFA). Fractions were collected at 0.5-min intervals up to 90 min and counted for radioactivity. Selected fractions were immobilized on Sequenlon-AA membrane discs (Millipore) for NH₂-terminal sequencing. Manual Edman degradation was performed as described (27) with a coupling and cleavage temperature of 55°C.

**A Cyanobacterial Phytochrome Two-Component Light Sensory System**

Kuo-Chen Yeh, Shu-Hsing Wu, John T. Murphy, J. Clark Lagarias*

The biliprotein phytochrome regulates plant growth and developmental responses to the ambient light environment through an unknown mechanism. Biochemical analyses demonstrate that phytochrome is an ancient molecule that evolved from a more compact light sensor in cyanobacteria. The cyanobacterial phytochrome Cph1 is a light-regulated histidine kinase that mediates red, far-red reversible phosphorylation of a small response regulator, Rcp1 (response regulator for cyanobacterial phytochrome), encoded by the adjacent gene, thus implicating protein phosphorylation-dephosphorylation in the initial step of light signal transduction by phytochrome.

---

The ability to cope with a continuously changing light environment is essential to the survival of all organisms that rely on sunlight for energy. Photosynthetic organisms, from bacteria to higher plants, possess numerous light-sensing molecules for perception and adaptation to fluctuations of intensity, direction, duration, polarization, and spectral quality of light (1). Most well known of these photoreceptors are the phytochromes, which sense ambient light conditions by their ability to photo-interconvert between red (Pr) and far-red (Pfr) light-absorbing forms (2). The hypothesis that phytochrome is a light-regulated enzyme was proposed nearly 40 years ago (3). Despite evidence that purified plant phytochromes exhibit protein kinase activity (4) and possess a COOH-terminal domain similar to that of bacterial histidine kinases (5), the enzyme hypothesis remains controversial.

Identification of the *rcaE* gene from the cyanobacterium *Fremyella diplosiphon*, which encodes a protein that is structurally related to higher plant phytochromes and bacterial histidine kinases, has renewed interest in the possibility that phytochrome is a protein kinase (6). Other phytochrome-like open reading frames (ORFs) have been noted in the cyanobacterium *Synechocystis* sp. PCC6803 genome (6, 7). One of these ORFs, locus slr0473, encodes a 748-residue polypeptide whose expression in *Escherichia coli* and incubation with phycocyanobilin (PCB), yielded an adduct with a red, far-red photoreversible phytochrome signature (8). Closer inspection of this phytochrome locus, which we have named *cph1* for cyanobacterial phytochrome 1, reveals another ORF only 10 base pairs (bp) downstream, locus slr0474, which we have named *rcp1* for response regulator for Cph1 based on this study (Fig. 1A). Because the COOH-terminal domain of Cph1 contains all conserved features of histidine kinase transmitter modules (Fig. 1B) and *rcp1* encodes a 147-amino acid protein related to the CheY superfamily of bacterial response regulators (Fig. 1C), which contain aspartate kinase receiver modules, we investigated whether these proteins represent a functional light-regulated transmitter-receiver pair (9).

Affinity-tagged versions of both proteins were cloned by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and expressed in *E. coli* (10). That Cph1 is a functional phytochrome homolog was demonstrated by its ability to catalyze its own chromophore attachment to yield photoreversible adducts with the higher plant chromophore precursor phycoerythrobilin (PEB), a phycobilin analog that lacks the C¹⁵ double bond found in PCB and PΦB, also produced a covalent adduct as visualized by zinc-blot analysis (Fig. 2B). The PEB adduct of Cph1 was photochem-

ically inactive, thus demonstrating that photoisomerization of the C15 double bond is required for Cph1 photoactivity, as is the case for higher plant phytochromes (11). The Cph1 deletion mutant N514, which lacks the transmitter domain (12), also bound all three bilins covalently (Fig. 2B), yielding PΦB and PCB adducts

with absorption difference spectra indistinguishable from the full-length photoreceptor (13). These data indicate that the NH2-terminal region of Cph1 delimits a functional photosensory domain (Fig. 2C) consistent with the structure and photochemistry of eukaryotic phytochromes (2, 14).

Cph1 is smaller than eukaryotic phytochromes; it lacks a 60– to 100–amino acid NH2-terminal fragment found on the photosensory domains of prototypical phytochromes and approximately one-half of the COOH-terminal region (Fig. 2C). Removal of the NH2-terminal portion of higher plant phytochromes blue-shifts its Pfr absorption maximum and attenuates its biological activity (14). Consistent with these observations, Pfr absorption maxima of Cph1-bilin adducts are blue-shifted relative to higher plant phytochrome bilin adducts whereas Pr absorption maxima are similar (Fig. 2A). The dark reversion properties of the two bilin adducts of Cph1 are particularly interesting (Fig. 2D). PCB adducts of Cph1 and the N514 deletion mutant display little dark reversion, whereas PΦB adducts show considerable dark reversion, with respective half-lives of 10 and 24 hours. In addition to demonstrating that Pfr stability depends on chromophore structure, these results indicate that the transmitter domain influences the conformational stability of the chromophore domain. In view of the potential role of dark reversion in the perception of photoperiod (3) and light direction (15), the identity of the natural Cph1 chromophore is of great interest.

To test whether Cph1 and Rcp1 represent functional transmitter and receiver molecules, we purified affinity-tagged versions of Cph1 and Rcp1 fusion protein (16) and analyzed the PCB adduct of Cph1 for protein kinase activity (Fig. 3A). Surprisingly, the Pr form of Cph1 exhibited adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-dependent autophosphorylation activity, whereas phosphorylation of the Pfr form was greatly reduced. Consistent with a histidine residue as the phosphorylation site, Cph1 autophosphorylation was base stable and acid labile. Similar experiments with the N514 mutant demonstrated that the transmitter domain was required for Cph1 autophosphorylation (Fig. 3A). That Rcp1 is a functional receiver substrate for Cph1 was established by phosphotransfer from Cph1 to Rcp1 (Fig. 3B). No phosphotransfer occurred with the Asp68 to Ala (D68A) mutant of Rcp1 (16), which lacks the conserved phosphate-accepting aspartate residue of receiver domains (9). The inability of the His538 to Lys (H538K) mutant of Cph1 to autophosphorylate and to support phosphotransfer to Rcp1 demonstrated that the conserved histidine at amino acid residue 538 in the Cph1 transmitter module is required for both activities (13). These data, taken together, demonstrate that Cph1 is a histidine kinase that mediates light-dependent phosphotransfer to Rcp1. Cph1 and Rcp1 thus represent a two-component regulatory sys-

tem in cyanobacteria that is modulated by red and far-red light.

The small amounts of Cph1 autophosphorylation and Rcp1 phosphotransfer activity exhibited by the Pfr sample (Fig. 3B) probably represent the presence of residual Pr and are consistent with the photoequilibrium mixture, containing 13% Pr, that results for higher plant phytochromes irradiated with saturating red light (2). To determine whether phosphorylated Pfr (Pfr*) was capable of phosphate transfer to Rcp1, we autophosphorylated Pr (Pr*), photoconverted it to Pfr*, and then incubated it with Rcp1 (Fig. 3C). By comparison with a control sample maintained in the Pr* form, phosphotransfer from Pfr* to Rcp1 was clearly prevented. Thus, the Pfr form of Cph1 lacks both autophosphorylation and Rcp1 phosphotransfer activities.

Organization of the cyanobacterial phytochrome operon is similar to the *F. diplosiphon rcaEF* operon, which encodes two elements of the complementary chromatic adaptation signal transduction pathway (6, 17). This and our biochemical data suggest that the molecular mechanism of Cph1 action involves light-regulated protein phosphorylation-dephosphorylation as depicted in Fig. 4. In this model, Cph1 can exist as four species—Pr, Pr*, Pfr, and Pfr*—whose abundances are regulated both by light conditions and by Rcp1 phosphorylation status. By analogy to the multistep phospho-relay cascades proposed for complementary chromatic adaptation in *F. diplosiphon* (17), sporulation in *Bacillus subtilis* (18), and osmosensing in yeast (19), Rcp1 dephosphorylation could be mediated by phosphotransfer to another regulatory molecule. Alternatively, the two forms of the small receiver molecule—Rcp1 and phospho-Rcp1 (Rcp1*)—could have distinct regulatory activities like CheY (9).

In higher plants, Pfr is thought to be the active form of phytochrome (2). Our studies suggest that the light signal transduced by Cph1 involves regulation of Pr abundance rather than that of Pfr. However, Pfr (or Pfr*) could perform an as yet unidentified role in the signal transduction process, such as allosterically regulating the activity of a Rcp1 phosphatase or influencing phosphotransfer to another regulatory molecule. In view of the evidence presented here, the presence of a transmitter-like domain in higher plant phytochromes (5) and the observed protein kinase activity of purified higher plant phytochromes (4, 13), we expect that the molecular mechanism of phytochrome function in plants will involve phosphorylation-dephosphorylation of transmitter- and receiver-containing signaling proteins like those prevalent in eubacteria and archaebacteria. It is intriguing that two-component regulatory family members have been identified in plants, including the putative plant hormone receptors for ethylene (20) and cytokinin (21). Given the physiological interplay between light and hormone responses in plants (22), we speculate that these receptors may be targets for integrated transduction of multiple signals.

its the transcription of genes that are regulated by a classical ERE, but like the natural estrogen hormone 17β-estradiol [E₂ (Fig. 1A)], tamoxifen activates the transcription of genes that are under the control of an AP1 element (9).

At the end of 1995, a second ER (ERβ) was cloned from a rat prostate cDNA library (10), and, subsequently, the human (11) and mouse (12) homologs were cloned. The first identified ER has been renamed ERα (10). The existence of two ERs presents another potential source of tissue-specific estrogen regulation. Here we compared the transactivation properties of ERα and ERβ with a panel of five ER ligands with the use of a reporter gene under the control of either a classical ERE or an AP1 element (13). Our results show that ERα and ERβ respond differently to certain ligands at an AP1 element. These results suggest different regulatory functions for the two ER subtypes.

We examined the transactivation properties of ERα (14) and ERβ (15) at a classical ERE in response to the estrogens E₂ and diethylstilbestrol (DES) and the antiestrogens Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) 164384, tamoxifen, and raloxifene (16). We conducted these experiments by transfecting HeLa cells with either an ERα or ERβ expression plasmid along with a reporter plasmid that contained a luciferase gene under the transcriptional control of an ERE (17). Both ERα (18) and ERβ (Fig. 2) showed the same transactivation profiles with the panel of ligands. E₂ and DES stimulated luciferase production 10-fold over ICI 164384, raloxifene, tamoxifen, and the control (no ligand added). The antiestrogens blocked E₂ stimulation in ligand competition experiments (18).

We next examined the ligand-induced transactivation behavior of ERα and ERβ at an AP1 site. With ERα, all five ligands stimulated luciferase transcription, including the antiestrogens ICI 164384, tamoxifen, and raloxifene (Fig. 3). This stimulation was dependent on transfected ER, as cells trans-

Differential Ligand Activation of Estrogen Receptors ERα and ERβ at AP1 Sites

The transactivation properties of the two estrogen receptors, ERα and ERβ, were examined with different ligands in the context of an estrogen response element and an AP1 element. ERα and ERβ were shown to signal in opposite ways when complexed with the natural hormone estradiol from an AP1 site: with ERα, 17β-estradiol activated transcription, whereas with ERβ, 17β-estradiol inhibited transcription. Moreover, the antiestrogens tamoxifen, raloxifene, and Imperial Chemical Industries 164384 were potent transcriptional activators with ERβ at an AP1 site. Thus, the two ERs signal in different ways depending on ligand and response element. This suggests that ERα and ERβ may play different roles in gene regulation.

Antiestrogens are therapeutic agents for the treatment and possible prevention of breast cancer. Tamoxifen (Fig. 1A) is an antiestrogen that is used in breast cancer chemotherapy and is believed to function as an antitumor agent by inhibiting the action of the estrogen receptor (ER) in breast tissue (1). Paradoxically, tamoxifen appears to function as an estrogen-like ligand in uterine tissue, and this tissue-specific estrogenic effect may explain the increased risk of uterine cancer that is observed with prolonged tamoxifen therapy (2). The related benzothiophene analog raloxifene (Fig. 1A) has been reported to retain the antiestrogen properties of tamoxifen in breast tissue and to show minimal estrogen effects in the uterus; in addition, it has potentially beneficial estrogen-like effects in nonreproductive tissue such as bone and cardiovascular tissue (3–7). One explanation for these tissue-specific actions of antiestrogens is that the ligand-bound ER may have different transactivation properties when bound to different types of DNA enhancer elements. The classical estrogen response element (ERE) is composed of two inverted hexanucleotide repeats, and ligand-bound ER binds to the ERE as a homodimer (Fig. 1B). The ER also mediates gene transcription from an AP1 enhancer element that requires ligand and the AP1 transcription factors Fos and Jun for transcriptional activation (Fig. 1B) (8). In transactivation experiments, tamoxifen inhib-
