Cardiomyopathies are disorders affecting heart muscle that usually result in inadequate pumping of the heart. They are the most common cause of heart failure and each year kill more than 10,000 people in the United States. In recent years, there have been breakthroughs in understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in this group of conditions, with knowledge of the genetic basis for cardiomyopathies perhaps seeing the largest advance, enabling clinicians to devise improved diagnostic strategies and preparing the stage for new therapies.

Congestive heart failure (CHF) resulting from cardiomyopathy is a serious malady and a principal cause of death and disability in children and adults. This disorder is the most common disease that leads to heart transplant, with an associated healthcare cost in the United States of roughly US$200 million per year¹. Cardiomyopathies are classified into four forms: dilated, hypertrophic, restrictive and arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia/cardiomyopathy. Restrictive cardiomyopathy is the rarest form, accounting for only 5% of the total², but has the worst prognosis and poorest therapeutic options of all the cardiomyopathies³. Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia is a complex arrhythmogenic disorder associated with cardiomyopathy and characterized by gradual loss of myocytes and replacement by fatty and fibrous tissue⁴. In Italy the prevalence has been reported as 1:5,000 people, accounting for 20% of sudden deaths in young adults⁵ and 25% of cardiac sudden deaths among athletes⁶; the incidence and prevalence are unknown in the United States. In this review we will discuss the identification of genes responsible for cardiomyopathies, as well as some of the animal models now being developed to further characterize the pathogenesis of these disorders.

## Dilated cardiomyopathy

Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is the most common cause of CHF, affecting 40 people in every 100,000 of the population⁷. Depending on the diagnostic criteria used, the annual incidence varies from 5 to 8 cases in a population of 100,000 (refs 7–9); the true incidence is probably underestimated by these numbers, as many asymptomatic cases go unrecognized.

Idiopathic DCM (IDCM) is characterized by an increased ventricular chamber size and reduced pumping of the heart (that is, reduced contractility; ref. 9 and Fig. 1) in the absence of coronary artery disease, valvular abnormalities or pericardial disease¹⁰. Backflow through the mitral valves and abnormal heart rhythms are common. Clinical features include common symptoms of CHF such as shortness of breath, easy fatigability, inability to tolerate physical exertion, fainting, light-headedness, sweating at rest, and sudden death. Other signs are increased heart rate and an enlarged liver.

Most commonly, IDCM presents between 18 and 50 years of age, but children of all ages and the elderly can be affected. It occurs more frequently in men than in women (2.5:1), and in African-Americans than in Caucasians (2.5:1), but the causes of these differences are not understood¹¹. The clinical course of DCM, almost regardless of the underlying cause, may be progressive, with roughly 50% of individuals reported to die within 5 years of diagnosis without transplantation⁸,¹⁰. The cause of death is divided evenly between sudden death and pump failure. Longer survival has been accomplished recently with improved medical therapies (such as angiotensin-converting enzyme

inhibitors and β-blockers) and interventions (such as implantable defibrillators and ventricular assist devices).

### Genetics of dilated cardiomyopathy

About 30–40% of individuals with DCM have a familial form of the disease (FDCM). Autosomal dominant inheritance is the predominant pattern of transmission; X-linked, autosomal recessive and mitochondrial inheritance are less common. Mitochondrial inheritance is seen most often in childhood forms of FDCM, whereas X-linked and autosomal recessive forms seem to be evenly distributed between childhood and adult forms of disease.

Over the past decade, progress has been made in understanding the genetic etiology of FDCM. Initial advances were made a decade ago through studies of families with X-linked forms, and in the past few years the autosomal dominant forms have become better understood. In the case of X-linked forms of DCM, two disorders have been well characterized: X-linked cardiomyopathy (XLCM), which presents in adolescence and young adults; and Barth syndrome, which is most frequently identified in infancy. The more common autosomal dominant form of FDCM also has two main forms: 'pure' DCM, and DCM associated with cardiac conduction system disease (CDDC).

### Autosomal dominant dilated cardiomyopathy

Individuals who succumb to DCM with CDDC do so typically in their twenties, and what begins as mild conduction system disease can progress to complete heart block over decades. Dilated cardiomyopathy usually presents late in the course of disease but is out-of-proportion to the degree of conduction disorder. In many patients, mild conduction system disease occurs with subsequent development of severe DCM.

There is genetic heterogeneity of autosomal dominant DCM, with ten genetic loci mapped for pure DCM and five loci mapped for CDDC. In the case of pure DCM, the genetic loci identified so far include chromosomes 1q32, 2q31, 2q35, 4q12, 5q33, 9q13-22, 10q21-23, 14q11, 15q2 and 15q14 (refs 13-22). As listed in Table 1, seven of these genes are now known: actin (chromosome 15q14), desmin (chromosome 2q35), δ-sarcoglycan (chromosome 5q33), β-sarcoglycan (chromosome 4q12), cardiac troponin T (chromosome 1q32), β-myosin heavy chain (chromosome 14q11) and α-tropomyosin (chromosome 15q2).

Cardiac actin, a sarcomeric protein, is a member of the sarcomeric thin filament that interacts with tropomyosin and the troponin complex (Fig. 2). Actin is significant because it links the sarcomere to the sarcolemma by binding to the amino terminus of dystrophin (at the sarcolemma) and to β-myosin heavy chain (β-MyHC; in the sarcomere). Notably, DCM-related mutations of actin may affect directly its binding to dystrophin; by contrast, mutations in the sarcomeric end of actin result in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM).

The DCM-causing mutations, first described by Olson *et al.*, are thought to result in disease by causing force transmission abnormalities. The mutations in cardiac β-MyHC and cardiac troponin T are thought to cause reduced force generation by the sarcomere. In the case of β-MyHC, the location of the mutations seems to disrupt either stereospecific interactions between myosin and actin that are essential for initiating the power stroke of contraction, or a hinge region of myosin that transmits movement. By contrast, mutations in cardiac troponin T may reduce ionic interactions that form a tight binary complex of cardiac troponin T and cardiac troponin C, again reducing the power stroke of contraction. In individuals with

**Figure 2** Proteins and pathways involved in the development of cardiomyopathies. Identified genes that result in dilated cardiomyopathy include the cytoskeletal protein-encoding genes β- and δ-sarcoglycan in the sarcolemma, dystrophin and the intermediate filament protein-encoding genes desmin and lamin A/C. Sarcomeric protein-encoding genes actin, β-myosin heavy chain, α-tropomyosin and cardiac troponin T cause either dilated cardiomyopathy or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, whereas cardiac troponin I, titin and the myosin light chains cause hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Mutations in α-dystrobrevin cause the intermediate phenotype, left ventricular noncompaction. MLP, muscle LIM protein; nNOS, neuronal nitric oxide synthase.

DCM, mutations in α-tropomyosin²¹ are thought to affect the surface charge of the protein; these mutations may compromise the integrity of the thin filament, resulting in defects in force transmission²¹. In individuals with HCM, however, α-tropomyosin mutations show different characteristics²⁴.

Desmin is a cytoskeletal protein that forms intermediate filaments specific for muscle²⁵. It is found at the Z lines and intercalated disk of muscle, and its role in muscle function seems to involve attachment or stabilization of the sarcomere (Fig. 2). Mutations in this gene cause abnormalities of force and signal transmission that are similar to those thought to arise from mutations in actin¹⁵. Animal models show similar clinical features to those of humans with DCM²⁵.

δ-Sarcoglycan, a member of the sarcoglycan subcomplex of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC; Fig. 2), is involved in stabilizing the myocyte sarcolemma and in signal transduction²⁶. Tsubata et al.¹⁷ have identified mutations in familial and sporadic cases of DCM that result in reduced protein within the myocardium. Animal models, such as the cardiomyopathic hamster and murine models, show a DCM phenotype²⁷,²⁸. Another sarcoglycan complex member, β-sarcoglycan, can also cause DCM when mutated¹⁶,²⁶.

There is also genetic heterogeneity of CDDC. So far, CDDC genes have been mapped to chromosomes 1p1–1q1 (ref. 29), 2q14–21 (ref. 30), 3p22–25 (ref. 31) and 6q23 (ref. 32). The only gene that has been identified is lamin A/C on chromosome 1q21 (Table 1), which encodes a nuclear envelope intermediate filament protein (refs 33, 34; and Fig. 2). The mechanisms responsible for the development of DCM and conduction system abnormalities are currently unknown.

### X-linked dilated cardiomyopathy

First described in 1987 as a form of DCM occurring in males in their teens and early twenties with rapid progression from CHF to death or transplantation, XLCM is distinguished by elevated amounts of serum creatine kinase muscle isoforms³⁵ — a sign of underlying skeletal muscle disease. Female carriers tend to develop mild to moderate DCM in their fifties, and the disease is slowly progressive. Towbin et al.³⁶ identified the disease-causing gene, dystrophin, and showed that it is responsible for the clinical abnormalities owing to a severe reduction or absence of dystrophin protein in the heart of these individuals (Table 1). These findings were later confirmed, with most mutations clustering in the 5′ portion of the gene and affecting the N-terminal actin-binding region of dystrophin³⁷.

Dystrophin is a cytoskeletal protein that provides structural support to myocytes by creating a lattice-like network to the sarcolemma³⁸. In addition, dystrophin has a principal role in linking the sarcomeric contractile apparatus to the sarcolemma and extracellular matrix³⁹⁻⁴¹. Furthermore, dystrophin is involved in cell signalling, particularly through its interactions with nitric oxide synthase⁴². The dystrophin gene is also responsible for Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy (DMD/BMD) when mutated³⁸. These skeletal myopathies present early in life (DMD is diagnosed before 12 years, whereas BMD is seen in teenage males older than 16 years), and most affected individuals develop DCM before 25 years of age. In most people with DMD/BMD, serum creatine kinase muscle isoforms are elevated to concentrations similar to those in XLCM; in addition, women carriers develop disease late in life, again similar to the X-linked condition. Furthermore, immunohistochemical analysis shows a reduced amount (or absence) of dystrophin, similar to that seen in the hearts of individuals with XLCM. Most individuals with DMD/BMD also develop DCM⁴³. It is an important disorder to understand because it is the most common skeletal myopathy, with a frequency of 1 in 3,500 newborn males. By contrast, the frequency of XLCM is not certain.

Murine models of dystrophin deficiency show abnormalities of muscle physiology that are caused by alterations in membrane structural support⁴⁴,⁴⁵. In addition to the dysfunction of dystrophin, mutations in dystrophin secondarily affect proteins that interact with dystrophin. As mentioned above, the N terminus of dystrophin binds to the sarcomeric protein actin, a member of the thin filament of the contractile apparatus. The carboxy terminus of dystrophin interacts with β-dystroglycan, a dystrophin-associated membrane-bound protein that is involved in the function of the DGC, which includes α-dystroglycan, the sarcoglycan subcomplex (α-, β-, γ-, δ- and ε-sarcoglycan), syntrophins and dystrobrevins (refs 44, 45; and Fig. 2). In turn, this complex interacts with α2-laminin and the extracellular matrix through α-dystroglycan. Similar to dystrophin, mutations in these proteins lead to muscular dystrophies with or without cardiomyopathy, supporting the idea that this group of proteins are important to the normal function of the myocytes of the heart and skeletal muscles⁴¹,⁴³. In both cases, mechanical stress⁴⁶ seems to be significant in the age-onset-dependent dysfunction of these muscles. The information gained from the studies on XLCM, DMD and BMD leads us to propose that DCM is a
primary disease of the cytoskeleton/sarcolemma, which leads to sarcomeric dysfunction ${ }^{47,48}$.

### Barth syndrome

Initially described as X-linked cardiomyopathy with abnormal mitochondria and neutropenia (low white blood count), Barth syndrome typically presents in male infants as CHF associated with neutropenia (cyclic) and 3-methylglutaconic aciduria ${ }^{49,50}$. Mitochondrial dysfunction is detected by electron microscopy and electron transport chain biochemical analysis. Echocardiograms show that these infants typically have left ventricular dysfunction with left ventricular dilation, endocardial fibroelastosis or a dilated hypertrophic left ventricle. In some cases they succumb to CHF/sudden death or sepsis caused by dysfunction of white blood cells. Most of these children survive infancy and do well clinically, although DCM usually persists.

The genetic basis of Barth syndrome was first described by Bione et al. ${ }^{51}$, who cloned the disease-causing gene G4.5 (Table 1). This gene encodes the protein tafazzin, whose function is not known. But mutations in G4.5 result in many clinical disorders ${ }^{52}$, including apparent classical DCM, hypertrophic DCM, endocardial fibroelas-

tosis and left ventricular noncompaction (LVNC) ${ }^{53}$, with or without other features of Barth syndrome.

### Animal models of dilated cardiomyopathy

So many of the genes identified for inherited DCM are also known to cause skeletal myopathies (Table 1), which suggests that skeletal and cardiac muscle share a 'final common pathway'. Further support for this concept comes from studies of animal models. Mutations in $\delta$-sarcoglycan in hamsters result in cardiomyopathy ${ }^{27}$, whereas mutations in any of the sarcoglycan subcomplex genes in mice cause skeletal and cardiac muscle disease ${ }^{28,44,45}$. Mutations in other DGC genes, as well as in dystrophin, also consistently show abnormalities of skeletal and cardiac muscle function in murine models.

Arber et al. ${ }^{54}$ have produced a mouse that is deficient in muscle LIM protein — a structural protein that links the actin cytoskeleton to the contractile apparatus. These mice develop severe DCM and CHF, and have disrupted cardiac myocyte cytoskeletal architecture. Badorff et al. ${ }^{55}$ have shown that the DCM that develops after viral myocarditis may have a mechanism similar to the inherited forms. Using coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) infection of mice, they showed that the CVB3-encoded protease 2A (enteroviral protease 2A) cleaves dystrophin, resulting in sarcolemmal disruption and possibly defects in force transmission, and DCM. A similar dystrophin mutation that affects individuals with XLCM shows a consistent mechanism of DCM development, namely, abnormalities of the cytoskeleton/sarcolemma.

### Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a complex cardiac disease with unique pathophysiological characteristics and many morphological, functional and clinical features ${ }^{56}$. In affected individuals the heart is thick; in particular, the interventricular septum and left ventricular posterior wall are thickened (usually asymmetric septal hypertrophy), and exaggerated pump function (that is, hypercontractile systolic function) is noted along with poor relaxation of the heart (diastolic dysfunction; Fig. 3). Obstruction of blood flow from the left ventricle to the aorta may also occur.

Although HCM has been considered by many to be a relatively uncommon cardiac disease, the prevalence of echocardiographically defined HCM in a large cohort of apparently healthy young adults selected from a community-based general population has been reported to be as high as 0.2% (ref. 56). Sporadic cases are common, but familial HCM (FHC) with autosomal dominant inheritance predominates ${ }^{56}$. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy seems to have a triphasic pattern of presentation ${ }^{56}$. The most common form occurs in people aged between 10 and 25 years, but late-onset disease has also been reported and infants have been diagnosed with HCM in their first year of life. The underlying disease process in young children is thought to differ from that in older children and adults, with different apparent causes. Because HCM is a principal cause of sudden death in young, healthy individuals and athletes ${ }^{56}$, it affects any population. In addition, a significant proportion of individuals develop CHF, caused either by diastolic dysfunction or by the development of left ventricular dilation and systolic dysfunction ${ }^{56}$.

### Genetics of familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy

The first gene for FHC was mapped to chromosome 14q11.2-q12 using genome-wide linkage analysis in a large Canadian family ${ }^{57}$. Soon afterwards, FHC locus heterogeneity was identified and several genes were mapped including chromosome 1q3, chromosome 15q2 and chromosome 11p11.2 (ref. 58). Five other loci were subsequently reported, located on chromosomes 7q3, 3p21.2-3p21.3, 12q23-q24.3, 15q14 and 2q31 (refs 23, 58; and Table 1). Several other families are not linked with any known FHC loci, indicating the existence of additional FHC-causing genes.

The genes involved in FHC encode proteins that are part of the sarcomere—a complex structure with an exact stoichiometry and several sites of protein–protein interactions ${ }^{59}$. The sarcomere proteins affected
Figure 4 Left ventricular noncompaction.

The heart is thick and has a dilated chamber (that is, hypertrophic and dilated). In life this ventricle functioned poorly.

by FHC include three myofilament proteins, β-MyH C, ventricular myosin essential light chain 1 (MLC-1s/v) and ventricular myosin regulatory light chain 2 (MLC-2s/v); four thin filament proteins, cardiac actin, cardiac troponin T, cardiac troponin I and α-tropomyosin (α-TM); one myosin-binding protein, the cardiac myosin-binding protein C (cMyBP-C); and titin (ref. 58 and Table 1). Each of these proteins is encoded by multigene families that show tissue-specific, developmental and physiologically regulated patterns of expression.

The gene responsible for cardiac hypertrophy and Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, previously linked to chromosome 7q3 (ref. 58), has been identified as that encoding the γ2 subunit of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a gene that is important in energy use (refs 60, 61; and Table 1). Affected individuals may develop disease in early life or as adults, and may succumb to CHF or sudden death. It is likely that these symptoms develop as a secondary result of sarcomeric dysfunction, and mutations in mitochondrial DNA 9 result in dysfunction of respiratory chain enzymes of the mitochondrial energy-producing compartment and also lead to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, especially in young children (Table 1). In some cases, hypertrophic dilated or frank dilated cardiomyopathy can develop. Hence, energy production and use, which is required for sarcomeric function and membrane integrity, are also important causes of these disorders.

### Left ventricular noncompaction

Left ventricular noncompaction is characterized by deep trabeculations in the left ventricle endocardium (Fig. 4), in association with left ventricular hypertrophy, dilation or hypertrophy/dilation 62,63. In some individuals the left ventricle is hypercontractile, but systolic dysfunction predominates in others. Two forms of LVNC have been described, an isolated form and a form associated with congenital heart disease. In the latter case, this non-isolated LVNC may be found in combination with septal defects, pulmonic stenosis or hypoplastic left ventricle 63. The two forms of LVNC are found in all age groups, although an infantile presentation seems to be most common; survival seems to be good 9,62,63.

The inheritance patterns of LVNC include X-linked inheritance in males with isolated LVNC, and an autosomal dominant pattern in some isolated and non-isolated cases. In the X-linked form, mutations in the gene G4.5 (Table 1), which encodes tafazzin, were initially identified by Bleyl and co-workers 62,63. This is the gene identified by Bione and colleagues 53 as causative for Barth syndrome (see above); in fact, some individuals with LVNC also have clinical features of Barth syndrome 62. Recently, we and our co-workers 63 identified a gene for non-isolated LVNC in a family with broad clinical features

ranging from apparent isolated LVNC, to LVNC with septal defects alone, to LVNC associated with hypoplastic left ventricle. This gene, α-dystrobrevin, encodes a dystrophin-associated protein (Fig. 2) that maps to chromosome 18q12 (refs 44,45; and Table 1). α-Dystrobrevin helps to maintain structural integrity of the muscle membrane, but also has signalling functions through the nitric oxide synthase pathway and is a substrate for tyrosine kinases 44,45. Deletion of this gene causes cardiomyopathy in mutant mice, supporting α-dystrobrevin as the cause of ventricular dysfunction 44,45. Again, skeletal myopathy is a feature to be noted. It is possible that the cardiac muscle abnormality is caused by disturbance of structural integrity and the congenital heart disease is due to perturbation of these signalling pathways in humans.

#### Animal models

Many animal models of HCM and LVNC have been generated 64. In the case of HCM, most of the known causative genes have been examined in mutant mice. The HCM phenotype first studied was that represented by the severe β-MyHC mutation Arg403→Gln, a mutation known to cause early death and severe hypertrophy in humans. Because MyHC mutations are responsible for 30–40% of the documented cases of HCM, MyHC represented a logical starting point for transgenic animal development. However, because the α-myosin heavy chain protein is predominant in mice (and not β-MyHC), the α-myosin heavy chain gene was mutated in the animal models and an Arg403→Gln mouse mutant was generated using a gene-targeting strategy 65. Homozygous animals were found to die shortly after birth, whereas sedentary heterozygotes survived, but showed abnormal cardiac structural and functional abnormalities typical of human HCM. Histopathological and physiological abnormalities included myocyte disarray, hypertrophy and fibrosis, which increased with age. Functional consequences included an acceleration in actin-activated cycling, increased rate of pressure rise and force development. Other MyHC mutations have also been generated, and typically the mutant mice show physiological abnormalities similar to those seen in humans carrying the corresponding mutations 64.

Murine models have also been developed for myosin light chain, myosin-binding protein C, α-tropomyosin, cardiac troponin T and troponin I, with variable similarities to the corresponding human mutations 64. Marian et al. 66 have developed a transgenic rabbit model caused by a common β-MyHC point mutation. As the predominant MyHC in rabbits is β-MyHC, mutant animals are more comparable to humans. In this model, wild-type and mutant human β-MyHC complementary DNAs were cloned 3′ to a 7-kilobases murine

Figure 5 Final common pathways of dilated cardiomyopathy and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. In dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), the cytoskeleton linking sarcolemma and sarcomere seems to be the key pathway, with disruption of the linkage leading to dilation (through the sarcolemma) and poor pump function (through the sarcomere). By contrast, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is thought to occur primarily through sarcomere disruption in the face of intact cytoskeleton/sarcolemma. Cascade pathways, such as mitochondrial (energy disruption) abnormalities, sympathetic tone or polymorphisms, signalling pathways, medications and other modifiers, can cause secondary disruption of these primary final common pathways that lead to the phenotype. Alternatively, direct mutations in the primary pathways can lead to the phenotype. ACE, angiotensin-converting enzyme.

β-MyHc promoter. Purified transgenes were injected into fertilized zygotes to generate two lines each of the wild-type and mutant transgenic rabbits. Animals carrying the mutant transgene showed substantial myocyte disarray, increased interstitial collagen expression in the myocardium, and hypertrophy of the interventricular septum and posterior wall of the left ventricle, mimicking the classical symptoms of human HCM. In addition, the incidence of premature death was increased. Therefore, this model is potentially more useful than mouse models for future studies to define mechanisms of human HCM and to develop new treatments.

Kittleson et al.⁶⁷ have reported a feline experiment of nature. A colony of Maine coon cats was found to have cardiomyopathy features characterized by moderate to severe papillary muscle and left ventricular concentric hypertrophy. In addition, the histopathology of the hearts of these animals has striking resemblance to human HCM, as does the natural history of the disease. Genetically, these cats have autosomal dominant inheritance with 100% penetrance. Crossbreeding the affected animals was lethal in these homozygotes, with stillborns having died *in utero*. Heterozygous animals developed HCM after six months of age, usually with an increasingly severe phenotype; classical features of HCM were seen typically during adolescence and young adulthood. Sudden death occurred in 20% of animals, and CHF was seen in 15% of cases. The gene responsible for this naturally occurring disease is not yet known.

Models of LVNC have been rarely described. So far, the only clearly defined model has been reported by Shou et al.⁶⁸, who used embryonic stem cells to generate mutant mice deficient in FK506-binding protein (FKBP12) — a protein that modulates the ryanodine receptor in its role as a calcium release channel. The FKBP12-deficient mice had normal skeletal muscle but a severely dilated form of LVNC. It is not clear how deficiency of the protein causes cardiac disease. Another model, the α-dystrobrevin-knockout mouse⁶⁹, develops hypertrophic dilated cardiomyopathy, although the authors did not describe features of LVNC. In this model, exon 3-targeted deletion was used to generate the mutant mice; this is the exon that is mutated in individuals with LVNC. It is likely that mutation of this gene not only disrupts the DGC, but also impairs signalling through the nitric oxide pathway. Whether there is any relationship between α-dystrophin and FKBP12 is not known.

**A common thread**

Clearly, HCM of adults is a disease of the sarcomere²⁴. Similarly, FDCM is caused by mutations in genes encoding cytoskeletal proteins⁴⁷,⁴⁸. Hence, the final common pathways of these disorders include cytoskeletal proteins (DCM) and the sarcomere (HCM) (ref. 48; and Fig. 5). Similar pathways have been identified for ventricular arrhythmias (ion channels) and congenital heart disease (transcription factors)⁴⁸. In addition, it seems that whereas cascade pathways are involved directly in some cases (that is, mitochondrial abnormalities in HCM and DCM), secondary influences are likely to result in the various clinical symptoms seen in individuals with similar mutations.

In both DCM and HCM, mitochondrial and metabolic influences are also likely to be important. In addition, molecular interactions with such molecules as calcineurin, sex hormones, growth factors and other signalling pathways may be involved in the development of clinical signs, symptoms and age of presentation. In the future we expect these factors to be uncovered, allowing the development of new therapeutic strategies. Moreover, using these pathways for molecular screening is likely to uncover disease-causing genes in individuals with failing hearts.

**The future for failure**

With so much known about the genetic defects that underlie the cardiomyopathies, one obvious direction for the future treatment of this condition is gene therapy (see the review by Isner in this issue, pages 234–239). Although dystrophin is the best studied of the known DCM-causing genes, correcting the dystrophin defects associated with X-linked cardiomyopathy has not been attempted as yet. However, many groups have reported approaches for the phenotypic correction of the potentially lethal skeletal muscle disorder Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Adenovirus vectors encoding dystrophin have been used in mdx mice, resulting in efficient transduction of muscle fibres following intramuscular injection. Restoration of dystrophin-associated glycoprotein complex proteins to the sarcolemma and a decrease in centrally located nuclei, a characteristic of dystrophin-deficient skeletal muscle, was observed⁷⁰. As yet there have been no studies in the heart.

Although gene therapy may be many decades away, our increasing knowledge of the aetiological basis and mechanisms causing CHF is now starting to encourage different therapeutic approaches⁹,⁷¹. In recent years it has become clear that therapies focused on improving cardiac function with inotropic agents improve the indices of contraction, as measured by echocardiography, but give no survival advantage. By contrast, β-blocker therapy⁹,⁷¹, which reduces heart rate and is a negative inotropic agent, improves survival and leads to

reverse remodelling (that is, normalization of ventricular size and function). In addition, left ventricular assist devices can also lead to reverse remodelling<sup>72</sup>. These findings suggest that reducing myocardial mechanical stress can improve cardiac function, possibly through remodelling of the sarcomere-sarcolemma-extracellular matrix linkage. For example, dystrophin loss is reversed after 4–6 weeks of assist device therapy<sup>73</sup>. In cases in which the dystrophin link is intact, administration of calcium channel blockers has been shown to be beneficial in mouse models<sup>74,75</sup>. The benefit is thought to stem from protection from myocardial ischaemia but might result from calcium blockade or vasodilation<sup>73</sup>. However, the identification of genetic aetiologies combined with tailored gene-specific therapeutics may offer significant improvements in disease prognosis and management in patients with congestive heart failure.
