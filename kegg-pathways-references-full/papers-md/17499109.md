Abstract: GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors mediate fast synaptic inhibition in the CNS. Whilst this is undoubtedly true, it is a gross oversimplification of their actions. The receptors themselves are diverse, being formed from a variety of subunits, each with a different temporal and spatial pattern of expression. This diversity is reflected in differences in subcellular targeting and in the subtleties of their response to GABA. While activation of the receptors leads to an inevitable increase in membrane conductance, the voltage response is dictated by the distribution of the permeant Cl<sup>-</sup> and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> ions, which is established by anion transporters. Similar to GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, the expression of these transporters is not only developmentally regulated but shows cell-specific and subcellular variation. Untangling all these complexities allows us to appreciate the variety of GABA-mediated signalling, a diverse set of phenomena encompassing both synaptic and non-synaptic functions that can be overtly excitatory as well as inhibitory.

Introduction

The spectacular progress of biosciences during recent decades has led to a vast accumulation of knowledge concerning mechanisms that govern the development and functions of living beings. It has also shown that much of the variation among species and organ systems, as well as among distinct brain regions and nerve cells, is largely due to what can be thought of as “combinatorics” of basic

molecular elements and signalling pathways. In fact, given the large number of possible conformational states and allosteric interactions that proteins and complexes thereof can assume, any potential signalling molecule can bind to an enormous variety of biologically relevant binding sites or receptors in diverse target cells. In the case of a neurotransmitter substance such as GABA, these ligand-binding site interactions take place at ionotropic and metabotropic receptors, at vesicular and plasmalemmal transporters and with metabolic enzymes. In the nervous system, such interactions of GABA culminate in its most important action — inhibition of neuronal firing (Kuffler and Edwards, 1958; Krnjevic, 1974).
The role of GABA as the main inhibitory transmitter in the mammalian brain is undoubtedly fundamental, but it should be noted that GABA also has excitatory actions (and “dual” effects — both inhibitory and excitatory) in a number of cell types (Cherubini et al., 1991; Voipio and Kaila, 2000; Ben-Ari, 2001; Marty and Llano, 2005). This is, only to be expected, because the properties of the ligand-binding site of a transmitter receptor channel do not dictate or even influence the biophysical properties of the channel’s ionic filter or the transmembrane ion gradients that set the polarity and driving force of the channel-mediated current. As inhibition and excitation are central issues in the present review, we want to note here that postsynaptic *inhibition* is best defined as a transient decrease in the probability of firing in the target cell, while postsynaptic *excitation* has the opposite effect. Very often, *hyperpolarization* and *depolarization* are taken as synonyms of inhibition and excitation, which is an error, as is evident from the above definition (and from what is described below). Importantly, the actions of GABA can be manifest as conventional synaptic transmission, involving the transient or “phasic” activation of receptors, or they can reflect the persistent or “tonic” activation of receptors in a manner temporally divorced form identifiable presynaptic events (Mody, 2001; Semyanov et al., 2004; Farrant and Nusser, 2005). Such tonic receptor activation can also have varied functional consequences.

GABA’s role as a neurotransmitter goes far beyond its immediate effects on the excitability of an individual target cell. Extensive work on cortical structures has shown that the activity of GABAergic neurons is crucially involved in the assembly of neurons into functional networks, and in shaping oscillations and transient population events at the network level (McBain and Fisahn, 2001; Buzsaki, 2002; Freund, 2003; Whittington and Traub, 2003; Buzsaki and Draguhn, 2004; Jonas et al., 2004; Vida et al., 2006). Many aspects of these network-level phenomena are based on GABA-mediated changes in the integrative properties of principal neurons that depend critically on synapse location and the timing of activity. Thus, numerous examples illustrate the importance of spatially distinct GABAergic inputs (axonic, perisomatic, proximal or distal dendritic) in enabling or regulating important neuronal behaviours in the cortex (Spruston et al., 1995; Miles et al., 1996; Pouille and Scanziani, 2001; Somogyi and Klausberger, 2005; Szabadics et al., 2006) and basal ganglia (Plenz, 2003; Tepper and Bolam, 2004; see also Chapters 6–11 in this volume). While a great deal of work has been carried out on GABAergic transmission in the basal ganglia, it is quite obvious that the amount of information available is not comparable to that for GABA actions in cortical neurons and networks. The aim of the present review is to provide a general overview of $GABA_{A}$ receptor-mediated actions in an attempt to facilitate future work on $GABA_{A}$ receptor-mediated transmission at the cellular and network level in the basal ganglia. Our main focus is on the electrophysiological, biophysical and ion-regulatory mechanisms that shape GABA-mediated postsynaptic potentials and tonic signalling.

## Molecular basis of $GABA_{A}$ receptor function

Ionotropic GABA receptors are members of the “Cys-loop” superfamily of ligand-gated ion channels (cl-LGIC), so named for a conserved motif in the amino-terminal domain in which a pair of cysteines forms a disulphide bridge (Simon et al., 2004). Other family members include the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, glycine receptors and 5-HT3 receptors. In each case, the receptors are pentameric assemblies of subunits (each with four transmembrane domains; M1–4) that form a central ion channel, which is gated by the binding of a small neurotransmitter molecule (Lester et al., 2004; Peters et al., 2005; Unwin, 2005; Sine and Engel, 2006). This remarkable gating reaction is the key to cl-LGIC function. Somehow, the binding of transmitter molecules to extracellular domains of the receptor triggers an extremely rapid conformational change that propagates through the protein to the transmembrane region and results in opening of the ion channel. In the case of $GABA_{A}$ receptors, two GABA molecules bind at the extracellular interfaces between $\alpha$ and $\beta$ subunits (see below). Investigations into the molecular basis of this phenomenon have been greatly facilitated by recent models of receptor structure, combining the atomic-scale model of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) fromTorpedo marmorata electric organ (Unwin, 2005) and the crystallographic structure of the soluble acetylcholine-binding protein (AChBP) from Lymnaea stagnalis (Brejc et al., 2001; Celie et al., 2004). This has allowed earlier studies, in which important ion-pair interactions were identified at the interface of the extracellular binding domain and the channel region (Hu et al., 2003; Kash et al., 2003; Kash et al., 2004), to be extended to a more complete atomic-scale picture of the gating process. This now incorporates translation of movement at the agonist-binding site, through electrostatic interactions within the binding domain-ion channel interface, to the M2 region, causing disruption of hydrophobic interactions within the channel and removal of the barrier to ion flow (Czajkowski, 2005; Lee and Sine, 2005; Lummis et al., 2005; Xiu et al., 2005; Corry, 2006; Sine and Engel, 2006).

The molecular diversity of ionotropic GABA receptors has been reviewed extensively (Barnard et al., 1998; Korpi et al., 2002; Sieghart and Sperk, 2002; Rudolph and Mohler, 2004; Sieghart and Ernst, 2005). In mammals, 19 GABAA receptor subunit genes are grouped into eight families according to their sequence similarity (α1–6, β1–3, γ1–3, δ, ε, θ, π and ρ1–3), with additional variation coming from alternative splicing (notably for α5, β2, β3 and γ2 subunits (Barnard et al., 1998; Simon et al., 2004)). It is often, and correctly, stated that such subunit diversity predicts enormous heterogeneity of receptor types. Indeed, without any form of constraint, 19 different subunits could form more than two million unique pentameric permutations. However, basic “rules” of assembly (Kittler et al., 2002; Lüscher and Keller, 2004) and a differential distribution of subunit types among brain regions and neuronal populations (Wisden et al., 1992; Fritschy and Mohler, 1995; Pirker et al., 2000) greatly reduce the number of receptor subtypes that exist in the CNS. While some subunits such as the α1 and γ2 are ubiquitous, others are much more restricted in their distribution. For example, the α6 subunit is confined to granule cells of the cerebellum and inferior colliculus (Luddens et al., 1990), the ε and θ subunits are found principally in nuclei belonging to various diffuse modulatory systems (cholinergic, noradrenergic, serotonergic, dopaminergic,

histaminergic and peptidergic cell groups (Sinkkonen et al., 2000; Moragues et al., 2002, 2003; Sergeeva et al., 2002, 2005) and the π subunit is present at low levels (if at all) in brain, but is strongly expressed in various other organs, including uterus and breast (Hedblom and Kirkness, 1997; Zafrakas et al., 2006).

In general, combinations of α and β subunits are sufficient to form functional GABAA receptors. However, the vast majority of native receptors are known to contain a third subunit type. Based, primarily, on data from studies employing subunit-specific antibodies, the most abundant GABAA receptor subtype in brain is formed from α1, β2 and γ2 subunits (McKernan and Whiting, 1996; Sieghart and Sperk, 2002; Whiting, 2003; Benke et al., 2004). Data from quantitative immunoprecipitation (Tretter et al., 1997), fluorescence resonance energy transfer between epitope-tagged subunits (Farrar et al., 1999) and electrophysiology of receptors with concatenated subunits (Baumann et al., 2002; Boileau et al., 2005; Baur et al., 2006) suggest a stoichiometry of two α, two β and one γ subunit. Receptors formed from other α, β and γ combinations (e.g., α2β3γ2 or α3β3γ2) are also widely expressed. Less numerous, though no less significant for the specific neuronal populations in which they are expressed, are receptors in which the γ subunit is replaced by a δ subunit (e.g., α4β3δ or α6β3δ). In yet other receptor subtypes, the γ subunit can be replaced by the ε or π subunits, while the π and θ subunits may be capable of co-assembling with α, β and γ subunits to form receptors containing representatives from four families (Bonnert et al., 1999; Neelands and Macdonald, 1999; Neelands et al., 1999; Sieghart and Sperk, 2002). Finally, additional variability comes from the fact that individual receptors may contain two different α or β subunit isoforms (Benke et al., 2004; Minier and Sigel, 2004; Boulineau et al., 2005).

While most subunits assemble as heteromers, the three ρ subunits form functional homo- or heteromeric assemblies that have sometimes been classed as GABAC receptors (Bormann, 2000; Chebib and Johnston, 2000; Zhang et al., 2001), based on their pharmacological similarity to bicuculline-insensitive GABA receptors originally identified in spinal cord (for review, see Johnston, 1996).
Nevertheless, they may be more appropriately considered a sub-class of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor subunits (Kaila, 1994; Barnard et al., 1998) and, indeed, they appear capable of forming functional receptors with γ2 subunits (Qian and Ripps, 1999; Pan and Qian, 2005) or with both α1 and γ2 subunits (Milligan et al., 2004).

### Ionic permeability of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors

Irrespective of their subunit composition, all GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors are permeable to the same ions. Based on measurements of the permeation of a series of large, weakly hydrated probe anions, the diameter of the narrowest part of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor channel has been estimated at about 0.55 nm (Inomata et al., 1986; Bormann et al., 1987; Akaike et al., 1989; Fatima-Shad and Barry, 1993; Kaila, 1994; Wotring et al., 1999). However, the GABA<sub>A</sub> channel is not a simple water-filled pore (Takeuchi and Takeuchi, 1971) and its ion selectivity sequence (SCN<sup>-</sup> > I<sup>-</sup> > Br<sup>-</sup> > Cl<sup>-</sup> > F<sup>-</sup>) differs from the corresponding sequence of relative ion mobilities in free solution, indicating electrostatic interaction between permeant ions and binding sites within the channel (Takeuchi and Takeuchi, 1971; Bormann et al., 1987; Akaike et al., 1989; Fatima-Shad and Barry, 1993). The ionic filter appears to be highly conserved, since both the channel diameter and ionic selectivity sequences are similar in diverse species, ranging from crayfish to frogs to mammals (Kaila, 1994).

Studies of different cl-LGICs have shown that aligned residues within the α-helical M2 region form the lining of the channel pore (Xu and Akabas, 1996; Keramidas et al., 2004), which is at its narrowest towards the intracellular portion of the channel. For homomeric ρ1 receptors, point mutations introduced towards the cytoplasmic mouth of the channel (within M2 and the proximal region of the M1–M2 linker), which alter effective charges, profoundly affect ion selectivity (Wotring et al., 2001, 2003; Wotring and Weiss, 2002; Carland et al., 2004). In heteromeric αβγ receptors, comparable mutations indicate that selectivity is determined by the β subunit (Jensen et al., 2002, 2005a, b). Residues within more

intracellular sections of the M1–M2 and M3–M4 loops, together with some towards the cytoplasmic end of M1, have also been suggested to contribute to the pathway for ion permeation in various cl-LGICs (Kelley et al., 2003; Filippova et al., 2004; Hales et al., 2006) and these may form parts of intracellular “portals” (i.e., narrow openings potentially capable of allowing ion passage), identified between adjacent subunits (Peters et al., 2005; Unwin, 2005).

Under physiological conditions, Cl<sup>-</sup> and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> are the only anions that act as carriers of current through GABA<sub>A</sub> channels. Data from measurements of the GABA<sub>A</sub> reversal potential (*E*<sub>GABA</sub>) entered into the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz (GHK) equation have provided estimates for the relative HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>/Cl<sup>-</sup> permeability that range from 0.18 in mouse cultured spinal neurons (Bormann et al., 1987) and 0.3 in crayfish muscle fibre (Kaila and Voipio, 1987; Kaila et al., 1989) to 0.6 in hippocampal pyramidal neurons (Fatima-Shad and Barry, 1993). While some differences are seen for recombinant receptors (e.g., homomeric ρ1 vs. αβγ; Wotring et al., 1999), much of this large variation is likely to have a methodological rather than a biological basis, and novel estimates of *P*<sub>HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup></sub>/*P*<sub>Cl<sup>-</sup></sub> from native mammalian receptors would be of much interest.

### GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor channel conductance

Although the channels formed by GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors are similarly *ion selective*, they do display differences in single-channel conductance, i.e., the rate at which they allow ions to flow. Most receptors display a prominent main conductance state and one or more subconductance states. The absolute conductance depends on the concentrations of permeant ions present, but with near symmetrical [Cl<sup>-</sup>] (~130–160 mM; room temperature in outside-out patches) the main conductance state of homomeric ρ1 receptors is ~1–5 pS, that of dimeric αβ receptors is ~15 pS, and that of ternary αβγ or αβδ assemblies is ~25–28 pS (Puia et al., 1990; Verdoorn et al., 1990; Angelotti and Macdonald, 1993; Fisher and Macdonald, 1997; Pan et al., 1997; Brickley et al., 1999; Boileau et al., 2005)).
Changing the type of $\alpha$ or $\beta$ has little or no effect on the conductance. These numbers show that $GABA_{A}$ receptor channels, while maintaining near-constant selectivity, can still allow ions to pass at high but variable rates. For a membrane voltage of $-70 \mathrm{mV}$, the main conductance of $\alpha \beta \gamma$ combinations (the predominant conductance level seen in neurons Gunther et al., 1995; Brickley et al., 1999; Lorez et al., 2000) corresponds to the flow of $\sim 1.1-1.2 \times 10^{7} \text { ions/s }$, or 1 ion per $85 \mathrm{~ns}$. The exact determinants of conductance remain to be established. The higher conductance of $\gamma-$ or $\delta$-containing receptors correlates with a greater net positive charge in the extracellular M2–M3 loop (Fisher and Macdonald, 1997; Brickley et al., 1999), but for the $\gamma 2$ subunit, a polar serine residue within the M2 pore region has been shown to be important (Luu et al., 2005). This residue is also present in the $\delta$ subunit. As indicated above, in the case of other cl-LGICs (nACh and 5-HT3 receptors), residues within cytoplasmic loops, thought to form ion portals (see above), profoundly influence channel conductance (Peters et al., 2005; Hales et al., 2006), demonstrating that interactions beyond the narrow pore play a key role in ion conduction.

It is worth noting that while the behaviour of the vast majority of native or recombinant $GABA_{A}$ receptors fits the pattern just described, the single-channel conductance of some $GABA_{A}$ receptors has been reported to vary widely in apparent multiples of an elementary conductance. This variation depends on the concentration of agonist used and it is markedly influenced by allosteric modulators such as benzodiazepines, which produce an increase in conductance or a shift towards occupancy of pre-existing higher conductance states, as described for receptors in hippocampal neurons (Eghbali et al., 1997, 2003; Birnir et al., 2001; Lindquist and Birnir, 2006) and in dopaminergic (DA) neurons of the substantia nigra (SN) (Guyon et al., 1999).

Under physiological conditions, I–V plots of $GABA_{A}$ receptor-mediated currents typically show GHK-type outward rectification (Hille, 2001), which is attributable to the asymmetric transmembrane distribution of $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ (Kaila, 1994). However, a genuine voltage dependence of

$GABA_{A}$ receptor single-channel conductance has been reported in some studies (Gray and Johnston, 1985; Gage and Chung, 1994; Eghbali et al., 2003; Lindquist and Birnir, 2006). In most cases, I–V plots for single channels are linear in symmetrical $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$, and rectification of macroscopic responses (e.g., Bormann et al., 1987; Weiss et al., 1988; Fisher, 2002; Pytel et al., 2006) has been attributed to a voltage dependence of receptor binding, gating or desensitisation (see below).

With these fundamental features of channel function in mind, we will now consider the way in which the receptors are activated in the brain, and the consequences of their activation.

### GABA concentration changes at the synapse

GABA is synthesized in the cytosol and accumulated into synaptic vesicles by a vesicular transporter (VGAT/VIAAT (McIntire et al., 1997; Chaudhry et al., 1998; Wojcik et al., 2006)) that is able to generate an intra-lumenal concentration thought to be in the range of several hundred millimolar (Axmacher et al., 2004). Thus, the fusion of a single vesicle liberates many thousands of GABA molecules into the synaptic cleft ($\sim 20 \mathrm{~nm}$ wide and $0.05-0.2 \mu \mathrm{m}^{2}$ in area), generating a GABA concentration waveform that peaks in the millimolar range (Mody et al., 1994; Mozrzymas et al., 2003; Mozrzymas, 2004).

The GABA transient to which the postsynaptic receptors are exposed is very brief. This is because diffusion of transmitter out of the synaptic cleft is predicted to be rapid (Overstreet et al., 2002; Mozrzymas, 2004), even allowing for the fact that diffusion within the cleft may be several-fold slower than in free solution (Nielsen et al., 2004). Indeed, experiments that have measured the displacement of low-affinity competitive antagonists such as SR-95103 (that dissociate on a timescale comparable to that of the synaptic concentration transient) or the effects of agents such as chlorpromazine or protons that slow down the binding of GABA to its receptors (and thus cause a greater reduction on inhibitory postsynaptic current (IPSC) amplitude when the exposure of synaptic receptors to GABA is brief) indicate atime constant of synaptic GABA clearance of 300–600 μs (Overstreet et al., 2002) or even as fast as ~100 μs (Mozrzymas et al., 2003; Mozrzymas, 2004). Once GABA has diffused beyond the synaptic cleft it is taken up by selective transport molecules into nerve terminals and/or glial cells.

In the simple case, where a population of receptors in the postsynaptic density is affected by transmitter molecules liberated from a single vesicle only, the transmitter concentration waveform experienced by those receptors will be influenced by a variety of synapse-specific factors. Importantly, it will be altered by variations in vesicle size and content, the nature of vesicle fusion, the geometry of the synaptic cleft and the number and arrangement of transporters and receptors in relation to the site of release (Liu, 2003). Such intrinsic factors are thought to contribute to the marked developmental increase in the speed of the synaptic concentration transient for both GABA and glutamate (Barberis et al., 2005; Cathala et al., 2005). Greater variation in the concentration waveform of GABA can arise when there is interaction between multiple vesicles released from a single synaptic specialization (multivesicular release), from neighbouring synapses, or following repeated synaptic activation. In each case, the postsynaptic receptors will be exposed to a GABA concentration transient different from that arising from the release of a single vesicle, and this will be particularly pronounced if vesicle release is temporally dispersed (asynchronous release).

Jones et al., 2006; McCartney et al., 2007) GABAA receptors do exhibit measurable spontaneous activity, but most allow ion flux only after they have been “occupied” by agonist, two molecules of GABA being needed for efficient gating (Baumann et al., 2003). In such a scheme — shared with other LGICs, and based on an extension of the del Castillo-Katz (del Castillo and Katz, 1957) mechanism (Fig. 1) — the agonist can be seen as activating the receptor by producing a massive (~100K–10M fold) increase in the basal probability of opening (Campo-Soria et al., 2006; Sine and Engel, 2006). Thus, exposure to GABA drives receptors through mono- and di-liganded closed states to the open state.

In order to describe observed channel behaviour (and hopefully to reflect physical events (Colquhoun, 2006)), extensions of such reaction schemes have been developed by many groups (Macdonald et al., 1989; Weiss and Magleby, 1989; Twyman et al., 1990; Jones and Westbrook, 1995; Haas and Macdonald, 1999; Jayaraman et al., 1999; Burkat et al., 2001; Akk et al., 2004; Celentano and Hawkes, 2004; Lema and Auerbach, 2006). All these models contain multiple open and closed states (Figs. 1d, e). A key difference among them is the presence of additional agonist-bound closed states, which can be entered instead of the open states (desensitized states; (Jones and Westbrook, 1995)), or prior to the open states, so-called “pre-gateway non-conducting” (Lema and Auerbach, 2006) or “flip” states (Colquhoun, 2006).

At the synapse, following the release of a single vesicle, GABA reaches a peak concentration that would, at equilibrium, produce maximal receptor activation. However, because the on-rate of binding of GABA is slower than the rate of diffusion (Jones et al., 1998), the short exposure means that only a fraction of the ten to a few hundred receptors clustered opposite the single release site (Edwards et al., 1990; Mody et al., 1994; Nusser et al., 1997; Brickley et al., 1999) will be fully occupied. The degree of receptor occupancy varies between synapses on different neurons and even between those on a single cell (Nusser et al., 1997; Perrais and Ropert, 1999; Hajos et al., 2000; Overstreet et al., 2002; Mozrzymas et al., 2003), and will, of

# GABAA receptor gating and the IPSC

GABAA receptors undergo considerable spontaneous motion while in the closed state (Bera and Akabas, 2005), suggesting a level of flexibility appropriate for rapid gating (Maconochie et al., 1994; Jones and Westbrook, 1995; McClellan and Twyman, 1999; Burkat et al., 2001; Chakrapani and Auerbach, 2005). In theory, the channel can open in the absence of agonist, albeit with an extremely low probability (Chang and Weiss, 1999a; Campo-Soria et al., 2006). Of note, some recombinant (Sigel et al., 1989; Maksay et al., 2003; Lindquist et al., 2004; Wagner et al., 2005; Ranna et al., 2006) and native (Birnir et al., 2000;
Fig. 1. Reaction mechanisms for cl-LGICs and the generation of a postsynaptic current. Panel (a) The del Castillo-Katz scheme (del Castillo and Katz, 1957), in which the agonist (A) binds to the receptor (R) forming a complex (AR) that changes conformation to yield a receptor with an open channel (AR*). $K_A$ is the equilibrium dissociation constant for binding and $E$ is the equilibrium constant for the gating step (opening rate constant/shutting rate constant; $\beta / \alpha$, panel c). Panel (b), Extension of this reaction mechanism, in line with the Monod-Wyman-Changeux scheme (see Colquhoun, 1998 for discussion), to include two binding sites and the potential for constitutive (un-liganded) channel opening. $E_0$ is the equilibrium constant for gating in the absence of agonist. The progressively darker shading moving from $E_0$ to $E_2$ is designed to indicate the massively increased likelihood of conformational change in the presence of two agonist molecules (see also Downing et al., 2005; Campo-Soria et al., 2006; Sine and Engel, 2006). Panel (c) A simplified two-site model, in which un-liganded and mono-liganded openings are ignored. The microscopic rate constants are shown for binding ($k_1$ and $k_2$), unbinding ($k_{-1}$ and $k_{-2}$), opening ($\beta$) and closing ($\alpha$). Shown beneath the reaction scheme are idealized state transitions (after Sine and Engel, 2006) for three channels activated by a brief pulse of agonist. Rate constants $k_1$, $k_2$, $k_{-1}$, $k_{-2}$ and $\beta$ determine the rising phase of the response (activation), while $k_{-2}$, $\beta$ and $\alpha$ govern the decay (deactivation). Open states of the same three events (1–3) are shown below, together with 17 other simulated openings. When summed, these produce the exponential decay characteristic of the synaptic current. The continuous orange line is the numerical integration of the same simulation. Panels (d) and (e) Examples of reaction schemes that have been used to describe the behaviour of GABA$_A$ receptors. The widely used model of Jones and Westbrook (Jones and Westbrook, 1995) (d) incorporates two liganded closed (desensitized) states (D$_{\text{slow}}$ and D$_{\text{fast}}$), while the model of Lema and Auerbach (Lema and Auerbach, 2006) (e) contains an additional “pre-open closed” or gateway state. In all schemes, the open (ion conducting) states of the receptors are shown in red.
course, be sensitive to factors that modify the time course of the GABA concentration transient. As outlined above, for those receptors that are occupied by GABA, a conformational change is elicited that may ultimately lead to channel opening. The behaviour of the receptors can be envisaged as a series of transitions through various closed, open and desensitized states. The time spent in each of the various states, and thus the time course of the postsynaptic current, is determined by the properties of the receptors and the profile of GABA exposure ([Mozrzymas, 2004]).

GABAergic miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs), resulting from the release of a single vesicle, have a rapid onset with rise times of only a few hundred microseconds ([Bier et al., 1996]; [Nusser et al., 1997]; [Brickley et al., 1999]). This reflects the proximity of the receptors to the site of GABA release, the rapid binding of GABA and the speed of the transition between closed and open states (i.e., a high rate constant for opening). As the GABA concentration transient is brief, the decay of the IPSC reflects the closure of channels following removal of ligand (deactivation). The duration of this process depends on the rate constant for channel closing, and also on various transitions of the receptor, notably entry into and exit from desensitized states that have been viewed as trapping GABA on the receptor prior to the final unbinding ([Jones and Westbrook, 1995]; [Chang and Weiss, 1999b]; [Haas and Macdonald, 1999]; [Bianchi and Macdonald, 2001]). Because the rates of these transitions differ for GABAA receptors of different subunit composition, the expression of different receptor subtypes contributes to differences in IPSC decay observed at different stages of development ([Okada et al., 2000]; [Vicini et al., 2001]) and in different cell types ([Nusser et al., 1999]; [Bacci et al., 2003]; [Ramadan et al., 2003]). Typically, IPSCs have a much longer duration in immature than in mature neurons.

As intimated above, discrete point-to-point communication, mediated by GABA release from an axon terminal onto closely apposed receptors, is not the only form of GABAergic synaptic signalling. The factors that determine the transmitter exposure of any particular receptor include its location relative to the GABA release site(s), the geometry and arrangement of the neighbouring cellular elements, the presence of diffusional barriers and the proximity of GABA transporters (see above; and [Barbour and Hausser, 1997]; [Kullmann, 2000]; [Overstreet et al., 2002]). Particularly under conditions favouring the release of multiple vesicles, GABA can escape the synaptic cleft at a sufficiently high concentration to activate additional receptors that may be located adjacent to the immediate postsynaptic receptors (“perisynaptic”), at other postsynaptic clusters within the same synaptic contact, outside the synapse (“extrasynaptic”), or at nearby synapses. Such “spillover” of GABA onto extrasynaptic or perisynaptic (α6- and α4-containing) receptors has been shown to contribute a slow component to IPSCs in granule cells of the cerebellum ([Rossi and Hamann, 1998]) and dentate gyrus ([Wei et al., 2003]). A more unusual form of spillover (possibly with activation of receptors only at sites remote from the point of release) is thought to contribute to the generation of slowly rising and decaying IPSCs (“GABA<sub>A</sub>, slow”) seen in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons ([Pearce, 1993]; [Banks et al., 2000]). These events originate at distal dendritic sites ([Banks et al., 1998]) and appear to reflect the activity of a unique population of interneurons and the activation of receptors with a different subunit composition (α5-containing) to those that underlie fast IPSCs from somatic and dendritic sites (α2- and α1-containing, respectively ([Prenosil et al., 2006])). Of note, similar slow IPSCs are also present in pyramidal neurons of the subiculum, which lack α5 subunits ([Prenosil et al., 2006]).

### Tonic activity of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors

GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors are not activated only during “phasic”, i.e., synaptic signalling. Persistent or “tonic” activation of receptors, independent of any identified release event, occurs prior to synapse formation in embryonic ([Valeyy et al., 1993]; [LoTurco et al., 1995]; [Owens et al., 1999]; [Demarque et al., 2002]) and immature ([Sipila et al., 2007]) as well as newly derived postnatal neurons ([Nguyen et al., 2003]; [Liu et al., 2005]; [Ge et al., 2006]), as well as in a variety of mature (synaptically connected) neurons ([Mody, 2001]; [Semyanovet al., 2004; Farrant and Nusser, 2005). Tonic GABAergic signalling in mature neurons was first identified in granule cells of the cerebellar cortex (Kaneda et al., 1995; Brickley et al., 1996; Tia et al., 1996; Wall and Usowicz, 1997), where, in addition to blocking IPSCs, $G A B A_{A}$ receptor antagonists were shown to decrease resting membrane conductance (see Farrant and Nusser, 2005). To date, similar GABA-mediated tonic conductances have been demonstrated in granule cells of the dentate gyrus (Nusser and Mody, 2002; Stell and Mody, 2002; Stell et al., 2003; Mtchedlishvili and Kapur, 2006), pyramidal cells and inhibitory interneurons in the CA1 region of the hippocampus (Semyanov et al., 2003; Scimemi et al., 2005; Shen et al., 2005), pyramidal neurons and interneurons in the somatosensory cortex (Yamada et al., 2006; Keros and H ablitz, 2005), thalamocortical relay neurons of the ventral basal complex and dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (Porcello et al., 2003; Belelli et al., 2005; Cope et al., 2005; Jia et al., 2005), magnocellular neurosecretory neurons of the supraoptic nucleus (Park et al., 2006), and at axon terminals of retinal bipolar cells (Hull et al., 2006).

While some $G A B A_{A}$ receptors exhibit a low but measurable probability of opening in the absence of agonist (see above), a variety of evidence suggest that the widely-observed tonic activity of $G A B A_{A}$ receptors reflects, in some neurons atleast, the persistent *ligand-induced activation* of specific receptor populations by low concentrations (nM to $\mu$M) of ambient GABA (see Cavelier et al., 2005; Farrant and Nusser, 2005; Santhakumar et al., 2006; but see McCartney et al., 2007). For different neurons, the concentration of ambient GABA to which they are continuously exposed may differ, but it is ultimately dictated by the effectiveness of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$- and $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$-dependent GABA uptake carriers. Often, such transporters are viewed as simply removing GABA from the extracellular space. In so doing, they act to limit spillover of GABA molecules from the synapse, alter the GABA concentration waveform in the synaptic cleft and ensure that “resting” GABA concentration remains sufficiently low to limit desensitization of synaptic receptors (Roepstorff and Lambert, 1994; Overstreet et al., 2002; Keros and Hablitz, 2005). However, transporters also have a significant and dynamic influence on ambient GABA (Richerson and Wu, 2003). This is because the extracellular concentration of GABA at which they are at equilibrium is dictated by the membrane potential and the transmembrane gradients for the transporter substrates (GABA, $\mathrm{Na}^{+}, \mathrm{Cl}^{-}$), each of which can vary (Overstreet and Westbrook, 2001; Richerson and Wu, 2003; Wu et al., 2003, 2006; Allen et al., 2004). In the extreme case, transporters can operate in reverse, and could, therefore, act as a source of GABA (Attwell et al., 1993). In general, such reversal does not contribute to the generation of tonic $G A B A_{A}$ receptor activity. Rather, blockade of transport increases the magnitude of the tonic current (Wall and Usowicz, 1997; Nusser and Mody, 2002; Jensen et al., 2003; Rossi et al., 2003; Semyanov et al., 2003; Sipila et al., 2004; Keros and Hablitz, 2005; Scimemi et al., 2005; Sipila et al., 2007), suggesting that, in some cases at least, normally functioning uptake fails to reduce the ambient GABA concentration below that capable of activating certain $G A B A_{A}$ receptors.

The identity of $G A B A_{A}$ receptors that generate tonic activity has been established in several neuronal populations (see Farrant and Nusser, 2005). Of central importance in many cases is the $\delta$ subunit. Unlike the $\alpha 1$, $\alpha 2$, $\alpha 3$, $\alpha 6$, $\beta 2 / 3$ and $\gamma 2$ subunits, which are found throughout the neuronal membrane but are highly enriched in GABAergic synapses (Craig et al., 1994; Nusser et al., 1995a, b, 1998; Somogyi et al., 1996; Fritschy et al., 1998; Brunig et al., 2002), the $\delta$ subunit has been shown to be present exclusively in extrasynaptic and perisynaptic locations (Nusser et al., 1998; Wei et al., 2003). This finding is consistent with the idea that a $\gamma$ subunit (most commonly the $\gamma 2$) is indispensable for synaptic clustering of $G A B A_{A}$ receptors (Essrich et al., 1998; Baer et al., 1999; Schweizer et al., 2003; Alldred et al., 2005; see also, Fritschy and Brunig, 2003; Luscher and Keller, 2004). The $\delta$ subunit co-assembles with the $\alpha 6$ subunit in cerebellar granule cells and with the $\alpha 4$ subunit in several areas, including the thalamus and dentate gyrus (Barnard et al., 1998; Sur et al., 1999). The initial suggestion that extrasynaptic $\alpha 6$- and $\delta$-containing receptors might mediate the tonic conductance in cerebellar granule cells (Brickley et al., 1996; Wall and Usowicz, 1997; Nusser et al., 1998) followed the recognition that thepostnatal development of the conductance mirrored the delayed expression of these subunits, and that α6- and δ-containing receptors display a high affinity for GABA and desensitize slowly and less extensively than αβγ receptors (Saxena and Macdonald, 1996; see also Farrant and Nusser, 2005). Subsequent studies showed that the tonic conductance in cerebellar granule cells is reduced by the α6-selective antagonist furosemide (Hamann et al., 2002) and abolished in mice lacking either the α6 (Brickley et al., 2001) or δ subunits (Stell et al., 2003). Likewise, deletion of the δ subunit (and concomitant loss of α4 expression (Peng et al., 2002)) reduces the tonic receptor activation in granule cells of the dentate gyrus (Stell et al., 2003). The δ subunit (in combination with α4 and β2 subunits) is also implicated in the generation of the tonic conductance seen in thalamocortical neurons of the dorsal lateral geniculate and ventral basal thalamus (Bellesi et al., 2005; Cope et al., 2005; Jia et al., 2005).

Although δ-containing receptors, by virtue of their high affinity for GABA and limited desensitization, would appear to underlie most of the tonic GABAA receptor activity seen in mature neurons, other receptor subtypes have been suggested to sustain a similar role. Although it seems obvious, it should be remembered that all GABAA receptors (even those exhibiting significant desensitization) could contribute to the generation of a tonic conductance if the ambient concentration of GABA were high enough to activate them. As discussed by Scimemi and colleagues (Scimemi et al., 2005), this is an important consideration when comparing different in vitro studies, some of which have measured tonic receptor activity in the presence of added GABA (Stell and Mody, 2002; Stell et al., 2003; see also McCartney et al., 2007), blockers of GABA uptake (Semyanov et al., 2003), or blockers of GABA metabolism (Wu et al., 2003; Caraiscos et al., 2004). It is also important with regard to the interpretation of the effects on tonic receptor activity of (potentially selective) positive allosteric modulators. While a lack of effect may be used to rule out the contribution of specific receptor subtypes, enhancement of the tonic conductance could reflect either a selective increase in the affinity of those receptors responsible for the conductance or a recruitment of receptor populations of lower

affinity that do not ordinarily exhibit tonic activity. In hippocampal pyramidal neurons, for example, α5-containing receptors would appear to contribute to the tonic conductance only when the concentration of extracellular GABA is elevated, while in mature tissue under “normal” conditions (without blockade of GABA transaminase (Caraiscos et al., 2004)) the conductance is mediated by δ-containing receptors (Scimemi et al., 2005). These observations also point to a tonic activity that is potentially dynamic, with different GABAA receptor populations playing a role under different conditions, as might result from developmental changes, pharmacological intervention, changes in the efficacy of GABA uptake, physiologically relevant changes in network activity or pathological changes such as epilepsy (see Scimemi et al., 2005).

Neuronal ion regulation and the driving force for GABAA receptor-mediated currents

As noted above, GABAA receptors are permeable to two physiologically relevant anions, Cl⁻ and HCO₃⁻, with a HCO₃⁻/Cl⁻ permeability ratio (P_{HCO₃⁻}/P_{Cl⁻}) of around 0.2–0.4. A frequent and erroneous assumption in the GABA literature is that this permeability ratio translates directly into identical quantitative relations of the respective anion currents during synaptic and tonic responses. With an intracellular pH (pHi) of about 7.1–7.2 and the above P_{HCO₃⁻}/P_{Cl⁻} ratio, the intraneuronal HCO₃⁻ concentration ([HCO₃⁻]i ~15mM) produces an influence on E_{GABA} that is equal to about 3–6mM Cl⁻. Hence, the role of HCO₃⁻ in setting the value for IPSP reversal can be significant, not only quantitatively but also qualitatively. In neurons with a rather hyperpolarized resting membrane potential and low [Cl⁻]i, the HCO₃⁻-mediated current component can, in fact, exceed the Cl⁻-mediated current, which leads to HCO₃⁻-dependent depolarizing IPSPs as shown in experiments on pyramidal neurons in adult neocortical slices (Kaila et al., 1993; see also Connors et al., 1982; Gulledge and Stuart, 2003).

The above observations have important consequences. They show that modestly depolarizing
IPSPs can be generated in certain neurons under resting, steady-state conditions (i.e., in the absence of activity-dependent redistribution of Cl⁻; see below) despite the presence of a functional Cl⁻ extrusion mechanism and a Cl⁻ equilibrium potential (\(E_{\text{Cl}}\)) that is more negative than the resting membrane potential. More generally, it is obvious that \(E_{\text{GABA}_{A}}\) is always more positive than \(E_{\text{Cl}}\), and this difference is accentuated when \([\text{Cl}^-]_i\) is low. A corollary of this is that in immature neurons and other neurons that have a high \([\text{Cl}^-]_i\), the contribution of \(\text{HCO}_3^-\) to \(E_{\text{IPSP}}\) is negligible (Fig. 2).

Hyperpolarization of the membrane potential is a key property of the “classical” IPSPs described in the original work by Eccles and colleagues on the glycinergic mechanisms in spinal cord motoneurons (Burke, 2006) and in most textbooks of neuroscience in relation to both glycinergic and GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor-mediated responses. However, from the above it is evident that robustly hyperpolarizing IPSPs in resting neurons are probably not as common as is generally thought. Because of the \(\text{HCO}_3^-\) permeability, the IPSP reversal potential can be very close to resting \(V_m\) in a number of cell types. This, however, does not imply an absence of an inhibitory effect of such IPSPs because the opening of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors leads to what is known as “shunting inhibition”: a decrease in the input resistance of the neuron with a consequent decrease in the membrane time constant and space constant of the target cell. Here, it is important to note that shunting inhibition is local and lasts only for the duration of the synaptic conductance change, whereas hyperpolarizing or depolarizing synaptic potentials outlast the originating conductance change, with their duration and spread dictated by passive membrane properties and voltage-gated channels. Thus, the decrease in time constant caused by shunting inhibition will suppress the temporal summation of simultaneously occurring excitatory inputs, while the decrease in space constant will suppress the spatial summation of such inputs. In fact, slightly depolarizing IPSPs such as those seen in hippocampal dentate granule cells may exert a more effective inhibitory action than hyperpolarizing ones. This is because the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor current shows outward rectification, and the slope conductance of the current-voltage (I–V)

Fig. 2. The effect of bicarbonate on the GABA<sub>A</sub> reversal potential. The relationship between the intracellular concentration of \(\text{Cl}^-\) (\([\text{Cl}^-]_i\)) and the reversal potential (\(E\)) for a purely \(\text{Cl}^-\)-mediated event and one mediated by GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors (with permeability to both \(\text{Cl}^-\) and \(\text{HCO}_3^-\)) was calculated for different permeability ratios (\(P_{\text{HCO}_3^-}/P_{\text{Cl}^-}\)) according to:

\[
E = \frac{RT}{F} \ln \frac{P_{\text{Cl}^-}[\text{Cl}^-]_i + P_{\text{HCO}_3^-}[\text{HCO}_3^-]_i}{P_{\text{Cl}^-}[\text{Cl}^-]_o + P_{\text{HCO}_3^-}[\text{HCO}_3^-]_o},
\]

where \(R\) is the ideal gas constant, \(T\) is the absolute temperature at \(37^\circ \text{C}\) and \(F\) is Faraday’s constant. The extracellular concentration of \(\text{Cl}^-\) (\([\text{Cl}^-]_o\)) was assumed to be \(130 \, \text{mM}\), the extracellular concentration of \(\text{HCO}_3^-\) (\([\text{HCO}_3^-]_o\)) was assumed to be \(25 \, \text{mM}\), and the intracellular concentration of \(\text{HCO}_3^-\) (\([\text{HCO}_3^-]_i\)) was calculated to be \(14.1 \, \text{mM}\) (assuming \(5\%\) ambient \(\text{CO}_2\) and an intracellular pH of 7.15). Note: Light grey (0.2), mid grey (0.3) and black (0.4).

relation is enhanced at depolarized values of \(V_m\). In addition, the absence of a hyperpolarizing component also prevents the generation of “rebound” excitation and the associated synchronization in the firing of cortical principal neurons that is often seen after hyperpolarizing IPSPs (Bevan et al., 2002; Somogyi and Klausberger, 2005). Interestingly, a recent study on subthalamic nucleus (STN) neurons (Baufreton et al., 2005) has shown that hyperpolarizing IPSPs increase the availability of voltage-gated \(\text{Na}^+\) channels that leads to a negative shift in the action potential (AP) firing threshold and to a dramatic enhancement of EPSP-AP coupling. This implies that GABAergic inhibition can prime STN neurons to respond more efficiently to excitatory
input, which adds a new dimension to the conventional view that GABAergic transmission from the globus pallidus (GP) to the STN restrains the activity of the STN (Albin et al., 1989).

Tonic $G A B A_{A}$ receptor activity results in a conductance increase that (just like a synaptically evoked increase) reduces the magnitude and duration of the voltage response to an injected current and increases the decrement of voltage with distance. The obvious difference between the two is that while one is spatially and temporally discrete, the other is distributed and persistent and leads to a maintained shunting inhibition. Predictably, therefore, tonic $G A B A_{A}$ receptor activation makes a cell less easily excited in response to a depolarizing input, and shifts the relationship between excitation current and output firing rate to the right (i.e., to higher levels of current) (Brickley et al., 1996; Hamann et al., 2002; Chadderton et al., 2004; Cope et al., 2005). In the case of excitatory synaptic conductances (as opposed to step current inputs), the effect of shunting inhibition is to decrease the slope of the input-output relationship, producing a change in “gain” (Chance et al., 2002; Mitchell and Silver, 2003). Again, just as for phasic events, the polarity of currents evoked by tonic receptor activation is not fixed and will depend on the membrane voltage and the net movement of $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ and $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$, and thus on the $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ and pH regulation of the cell (see below). In thalamocortical neurons, for example, persistent $G A B A_{A}$ receptor activation has been shown to produce a hyperpolarization of $1-2 \mathrm{mV}$, and block of the tonic receptor activity causes a depolarization that promotes a shift from a burst firing towards a tonic firing mode (Cope et al., 2005). By contrast, in immature neurons, tonic $G A B A_{A}$ receptor activity can cause depolarization, as described below.

Neuronal chloride regulation

Neuronal $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ homeostasis is mainly controlled by the $S L C 12 A$ family of cation-chloride co-transporters (CCCs; Fig. 3). The CCCs are composed of glycoproteins (MW of monomers in the range of 120–200 kDa) with 12 putative transmembrane segments flanked on one side by a small intracellular amino-terminus and by a large intracellular carboxy-terminus on the other (Payne et al., 2003). CCCs are secondary active transporters that do not directly consume ATP, but derive the energy for $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ translocation from the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ gradients generated by the Na-K-ATPase. The Na-K-2Cl co-transporters (NKCCs) mediate $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ uptake fuelled by the plasmalemmal $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ gradient, and K-Cl co-transporters (KCCs) extrude $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ under physiological conditions using the $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ gradient. Both types of transporters are electrically neutral and hence do not have direct effects on the membrane potential. So far, two NKCC (NKCC1 and NKCC2) and four KCC isoforms (KCC1–4) have been identified (Delpire and Mount, 2002; Payne et al., 2003; Gamba, 2005). From these, NKCC1 as well as KCC2 and KCC3 have been shown to be expressed and functional in neurons (Payne et al., 1996; Plotkin et al., 1997; Rivera et al., 1999; Boettger et al., 2003). Some immature neurons express KCC4, at least at the mRNA level (Li et al., 2002).

NKCCs are kinetically activated by phosphorylation while KCCs are activated by dephosphorylation (Russell, 2000; Gamba, 2005). In neurons, much work remains to be done to identify the specific signalling cascades that modify the kinetics of $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ transporters (Kelsch et al., 2001; Payne et al., 2003; Khirug et al., 2005). The phosphorylation cascade that targets NKCC is suppressed by intracellular $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ that leads to a negative feedback loop that inhibits NKCC1 activity when a sufficiently high $\left[\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\right]_{\mathrm{i}}$ is achieved (Lytle and Forbush, 1996). As for KCC2, an increase in $\left[\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\right]_{\mathrm{i}}$ leads to an immediate increase in net $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ efflux that is caused by the increase in the outward driving force for K-Cl co-transport and not by a change in the kinetics of the transporter (Payne et al., 2003; Khirug et al., 2005). Recent work points to a role for WNK3, a member of the WNK family of serine-threonine kinases, in the control of $\left[\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\right]_{\mathrm{i}}$ by upregulation of NKCC1 and down-regulation of KCC2 activity (Kahle et al., 2005).

The KCC2 molecule has gained much attention since it has an exclusively neuron-specific expression and is responsible for the generation of “classical” hyperpolarizing IPSPs (Rivera et al., 1999; Hubner et al., 2001). KCC2 is operational under isotonic conditions (Mercado et al., 2006) and in cortical principal cells it is constitutively active
Fig. 3. Ion transporters set the value of $E_{GABA_A}$. Panel (a) The net effect of various $\mathrm{Cl}^-$ co-transporters and exchangers determines the reversal potential for GABA$_A$ receptor-mediated currents. On the left are shown those mechanisms that result in accumulation of $\mathrm{Cl}^-$ in neurons, in the middle are shown mechanisms that result in extrusion of $\mathrm{Cl}^-$, and on the right is shown a $\mathrm{Cl}^-$ and $\mathrm{HCO}_3^-$ permeable GABA-gated channel. The Na–K–2Cl co-transporter isoform 1, NKCC1, mediates electrically neutral $\mathrm{Cl}^-$ uptake; this is a secondary active transport process driven by the $\mathrm{Na}^+$ concentration gradient that is generated by the Na/K ATPase (see Panel (b)). The K-Cl co-transporter isoform 2, KCC2, mediates $\mathrm{Cl}^-$ extrusion driven by the $\mathrm{K}^+$ gradient. The $\mathrm{Na}^+$-dependent and -independent anion exchangers (NDAE and AE3, respectively) regulate $\mathrm{pH}_i$, but they also influence neuronal $\mathrm{Cl}^-$ homeostasis, and provide a link between neuronal $\mathrm{HCO}_3^-/\mathrm{pH}$ and $\mathrm{Cl}^-$ regulation. The carbonic anhydrase isoform VII (CAVII) is present in several types of neurons, and catalyzes the formation of $\mathrm{HCO}_3^-$ from $\mathrm{CO}_2$. Panel (b) The “developmental switch” from depolarization to hyperpolarization. In immature neurons (left), depolarizing GABA$_A$ receptor-mediated responses are largely attributable to neuronal $\mathrm{Cl}^-$ accumulation via NKCC1. During maturation, the developmental up-regulation of functional KCC2 and down-regulation of NKCC1 result in a decrease in $[\mathrm{Cl}^-]_i$ thereby providing the basis for conventional, hyperpolarizing IPSPs (right).

(Khirug et al., 2005; see also Lee et al., 2005). Unlike some other KCC isoforms (especially KCC4), KCC2 is not sensitive to changes in cellular volume as such. However, cell (and especially dendritic) swelling that is triggered in neurons during intense synaptic activity (Dietzel et al., 1980; Jefferys, 1995) is linked to an increase in $[\mathrm{Cl}^-]_i$ that leads to an increase in the $\mathrm{Cl}^-$ driving force acting on KCC2, and hence to a “quasi volume-regulatory” enhancement of chloride extrusion. In principle, both NKCCs and KCCs are bidirectional and can carry out net $\mathrm{Cl}^-$ influx or efflux, depending on the concentration gradients of the relevant ions. However, a reversal of the direction of $\mathrm{Cl}^-$ transport is physiologically important only in the case of KCCs and in particular for KCC2, which often operates at close-equilibrium conditions. Hence, a modest increase in extracellular $\mathrm{K}^+$ can lead to a KCC2-mediated net influx of $\mathrm{Cl}^-$ and to a consequent depolarizing shift in the IPSP reversal potential (Thompson and Gahwiler, 1989; Kakazu et al., 2000).

At the subcellular level, KCC2 is heavily expressed in dendritic spines both in cortical
principal neurons as well as in interneurons (Gulyas et al., 2001), but “hot spots” of KCC2 expression occur also elsewhere, including the postsynaptic membranes in inhibitory synapses located in the dendrites of GABAergic neurons in the SN (Gulacsi et al., 2003). Work on hippocampal pyramidal cells has shown that in immature neurons, NKCC1 has a mainly somatic expression that thereafter develops into a predominantly dendritic one (Marty et al., 2002).

It has been recently shown that KCC3 is expressed in a large variety of neurons, including hippocampal pyramidal cells and cerebellar Purkinje neurons, where it has been shown to influence \(E_{\text{GABA}}\) (Boettger et al., 2003). Unlike KCC2, KCC3 is genuinely volume sensitive (Race et al., 1999). Clearly, more work is needed to gain an understanding of the role of this KCC isoform in the regulation of \([\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_{i}\) in various kinds of neurons.

Both functional and structural data indicate that transporter molecules taking up and extruding chloride, NKCC1 and KCCs, are co-expressed in certain types of mature neurons (Misgeld et al., 1986; Vardi et al., 2000; Martina et al., 2001; Duebel et al., 2006). In fact, various kinds of cells employ several distinct transport mechanisms, where the principal ionic substrate is transported in opposite directions. This seemingly paradoxical push-pull design permits a precise control of the set-point of the particular intracellular ion under various physiological conditions (Roos and Boron, 1981). Such a situation appears to be true for dentate gyrus granule cells, which co-express KCC2 plus NKCC1 (Kanaka et al., 2001) and exhibit powerful GABAergic inhibition in spite of their slightly depolarizing \(G A B A_{A}\) responses (Misgeld et al., 1986). Furthermore, discrete subcellular distributions of NKCC1 and KCC2–3 may produce intraneuronal \(\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\)gradients (even under “resting” conditions) that shape GABAergic responses in a cell-region dependent manner (Duebel et al., 2006; Szabadics et al., 2006). Additionally, the observation of large changes in monovalent cation concentrations (Rose and Konnerth, 2001) seen in neuronal spines during excitatory transmission, raises the possibility that spines form microdomains where \(\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\)levels undergo large activity-dependent changes. However, there is currently no direct evidence for or against this idea.

In addition to the CCCs, \([\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_{i}\) is also influenced by the \(\mathrm{Na}^{+}\)-dependent and -independent anion \((\mathrm{Cl}^{-} / \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-})\)exchangers NDAE (or NDCBE) and AE3 that extrude and accumulate \(\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\), respectively. These transporters have a major role in the regulation of neuronal \(\mathrm{pH}_{i}\), as described below.

### Neuronal pH regulation and \(E_{\text{GABA}}\)

In virtually all kinds of cells, including neurons, acid extrusion mechanisms (extrusion of \(\mathrm{H}^{+}\), uptake of \(\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\)) maintain \(\mathrm{pH}_{i}\) at a significantly more alkaline level than what would be predicted on the basis of a passive distribution of \(\mathrm{H}^{+}\)and \(\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\)ions (Roos and Boron, 1981). Therefore, the equilibrium potential for \(\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\)(which equals the equilibrium potential of \(\mathrm{H}^{+}\)) is much more positive than the resting membrane potential (typically about \(-10\) to \(-15 \mathrm{mV}\)). Unlike \(\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\)that can mediate either depolarizing or hyperpolarizing currents across \(G A B A_{A}\) receptor channels, \(\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\)invariably mediates a depolarizing current under physiological conditions (Kaila and Voipio, 1987; Kaila, 1994).

Neuronal acid extrusion is mainly achieved by \(\mathrm{Na}^{+}\)-driven \(\mathrm{Cl}^{-} / \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\)exchange (“NDAE”, synonymous with “NDCBE”) and \(\mathrm{Na}^{+} / \mathrm{H}^{+}\)exchange (Chesler, 2003; Payne et al., 2003; Romero et al., 2004). Both types of transporters are activated by a fall in \(\mathrm{pH}_{i}\), which can be generated, e.g., by GABAergic transmission that leads to a channel-mediated net efflux of \(\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\)(Kaila et al., 1990) and by glutamatergic transmission and spiking that produce an increase in intraneuronal \(\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\) and a consequent acidosis (Ballanyi and Kaila, 1998). An excess alkalosis, which is most likely a rather exceptional event under physiological conditions, leads to activation of the \(\mathrm{Na}^{+}\)-independent anion exchanger (AE3) that extrudes base equivalents in the form of \(\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\)in exchange for \(\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\)(Romero et al., 2004).

Carbonic anhydrases (CA) are enzymes that catalyze the reversible hydration of \(\mathrm{CO}_{2}\) into water and \(\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\). To date, 12 catalytically active CA isozymes are known, and five of these show a cytosolic localization (Pastorekova et al., 2004). During a large channel-mediated net efflux ofHCO₃⁻, the intracellular HCO₃⁻ is quickly replenished by the activity of a cytosolic CA isoform (Kaila et al., 1990; Pasternack et al., 1993). In neonatal rat pyramidal neurons, CA activity is absent until around P10, and thereafter a steep increase in the expression of the CAVII isoform takes place (Ruusuvuori et al., 2004). Hence, CAVII acts as a second “developmental switch” (after KCC2 expression; see below) at the ion-regulatory level to modulate postsynaptic GABA-ergic responses in a qualitative manner.

### The “developmental switch” from depolarization to hyperpolarization

In a pioneering study, Obata et al. (1978) showed that GABA has an excitatory action in co-cultures of muscle and spinal neurons taken from 6- to 8-day-old chick embryos, while an inhibitory effect was observed when culturing was started on day 10. Immature neurons are known to have very high input impedance that makes recordings with conventional sharp microelectrodes difficult and unreliable. However, the excitatory effect of GABA (and glycine) demonstrated by Obata and co-workers was clearly a genuine response of intact neurons, since recordings from the muscle cells showed that the GABA-induced end-plate potentials were blocked by TTX, which was indicative of motoneuronal spiking. In another hallmark study, Ben-Ari et al. (1989) demonstrated a similar shift in hippocampal pyramidal neurons from depolarizing to hyperpolarizing GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor-mediated responses. This “ontogenetic switch” in GABA action appears to be an almost ubiquitous feature of central neurons. In hippocampal and neocortical neurons, this switch is attributable to the developmental up-regulation of KCC2 that is paralleled by a down-regulation of NKCC1 (Rivera et al., 1999; Yamada et al., 2004; Rivera et al., 2005).

The cellular signalling cascades that trigger the expression of KCC2 and the postsynaptic switch from depolarizing to hyperpolarizing GABA action have not been identified. At least in neuronal cultures from both the hippocampus and the midbrain, neither spiking nor the transmitter actions

of GABA or glutamate are absolute requirements for the induction of KCC2 expression and hyperpolarizing GABA responses (Ludwig et al., 2003; Titz et al., 2003). In cultures of cortical neurons as well as in neurons in the brain stem, KCC2 is initially expressed in an inactive form (Balakrishnan et al., 2003), but in cortical pyramidal neurons KCC2 becomes functionally active at the time of its expression (Khirug et al., 2005). These observations indicate that the mechanisms underlying the developmental up-regulation of functional KCC2 show some degree of variation among different neuronal types, and call for caution in any direct extrapolation from data on, e.g., cortical neurons to basal ganglia (Blaesse et al., 2006).

In immature pyramidal neurons, the specific NKCC1 antagonist bumetanide selectively blocks the depolarizing GABAergic response (Yamada et al., 2004; Sipila et al., 2006). Unfortunately, there is no selective blocker available for KCC2, and hence a gene knock-down strategy was used in the study of the role of this K-Cl co-transporter isoform in the maturation of GABAergic responses (Rivera et al., 1999). Furosemide is often used to block KCC2, but this drug is equally potent in inhibiting NKCC1 (Payne et al., 2003).

In immature neurons, depolarizing GABAergic responses have been shown to activate voltage-gated Ca²⁺ channels and to facilitate the activation of NMDA receptors, which leads to intracellular Ca²⁺ transients and to the activation of various intracellular signaling cascades (Yuste and Katz, 1991; Leinekugel et al., 1997; Fukuda et al., 1998). Such mechanisms are important for trophic actions of GABA that influence neuronal proliferation and migration, as well as the morphological maturation of individual neurons, and synaptogenesis (LoTurco et al., 1995; Owens and Kriegstein, 2002). However, the exact manner in which these processes contribute to normal development (or crucially perhaps, the nature of any redundancy in the system) remains to be determined, as synapse formation and early brain development appear essentially unaltered when GABA synthesis (Ji et al., 1999), vesicular transport (Wojcik et al., 2006) or vesicular release (Verhage et al., 2000; Varoqueaux et al., 2002) are eliminated (see also, Represa and Ben-Ari, 2005).
In the hippocampus, depolarizing GABAergic transmission appears to play a key role in the generation of endogenous network events that are thought to be crucial for the proper development of neuronal connections (Ben-Ari, 2001). Traditionally, these early events and particularly the so-called “giant depolarizing potentials” (GDPs) generated in the immature hippocampus were thought to be driven by depolarizing and excitatory GABAergic transmission. However, recent work has demonstrated that GDPs are not paced by GABAergic interneurons but rather by glutamatergic principal neurons, and that depolarization caused by GABAA receptor activation (brought about by both tonic and synaptically released GABA) has a *facilitatory* or *permissive* role in the generation of GDPs (Sipila and Kaila, In press; Sipila et al., 2005), and perhaps also of other kinds of early spontaneous events (Zheng et al., 2006).

robustly depolarizing and sometimes even excitatory GABAA-mediated PSPs occur not only in immature neurons but also in some interneurons that seem to actively accumulate Cl⁻ (Martina et al., 2001; Chavas and Marty, 2003; Marty and Llano, 2005). However, it has been known for a long time (Kaila and Voipio, 1987) that persistent activation of GABAA receptors can lead to changes in the distribution of Cl⁻ and HCO₃⁻ in target cells, and hence, to marked changes in the effects of GABAA-mediated transmission (Kaila, 1994).

A well-known example of short-term ionic plasticity is the biphasic GABAergic responses in hippocampal pyramidal neurons that can be evoked by high-frequency stimulation (HFS) of hippocampal interneurons in the absence of ionotropic glutamatergic transmission (Grover et al., 1993; Kaila et al., 1997; Smirnov et al., 1999; Ruusuvuori et al., 2004). The biphasic response has a fast initial hyperpolarizing component that is followed by a depolarization with a duration (up to several seconds) that outlasts any possible action of synaptically released GABA. Importantly, the depolarization is strong enough to trigger spike bursts in the CA1 pyramids, which demonstrates that during intense interneuronal activity, GABA’s signalling role can undergo a qualitative change from inhibitory to excitatory. A detailed analysis of the ionic bases of the biphasic response has shown that the initial part of the depolarization is caused by anionic redistribution, where the inwardly directed HCO₃⁻ current drives a depolarization that promotes the uptake of Cl⁻ and, hence, a positive shift in \(E_{\text{GABA}}\) (Kaila et al., 1997; Smirnov et al., 1999). However, the prolonged depolarization that is seen afterwards is caused by an increase in extracellular K⁺, which is attributable to the recovery of the neuronal [Cl⁻] levels that by necessity requires a net efflux of Cl⁻ and K⁺ in a 1:1 stoichiometry. Hence, during the prolonged depolarization, the \(V_m\) of the pyramidal neurons achieves a level that is much more depolarized than the simultaneous value of \(E_{\text{GABA}}\). As expected, membrane-permeant CA inhibitors strongly suppress HFS-induced GABAergic excitation (Ruusuvuori et al., 2004).

While the above data have been obtained under rather extreme experimental conditions (similar to those used in conventional LTP-induction

Ionic plasticity of GABAA receptor-mediated signalling

Ionotropic glutamatergic transmission does not appear to be heavily modulated by activity-dependent changes in the driving force of the postsynaptic currents. In contrast to this, GABAergic signalling has the unique property of “ionic plasticity” which is based on both short-term and long-term shifts in the concentrations of Cl⁻ and HCO₃⁻ in postsynaptic neurons. This type of plasticity phenomena fall into two categories: short-term modulatory changes that are solely attributable to activity-dependent ionic shifts in the target cell (Voipio and Kaila, 2000) and long-term effects that involve changes in the kinetic properties or synthesis and trafficking of ion-regulatory proteins (Woodin et al., 2003; Rivera et al., 2004; Fiumelli et al., 2005).

The voltage response associated with GABAA-mediated single IPSPs evoked under resting conditions can be robustly hyperpolarizing (such as in hippocampal pyramidal neurons and in SN GABAergic neurons), slightly hyperpolarizing or depolarizing (e.g., neocortical pyramidal neurons and SN DA neurons), slightly but consistently depolarizing (e.g., dentate granule cells). As discussed earlier,

paradigms), it is likely that qualitatively similar activity-dependent ionic redistributions take place in various kinds of cells in the brain. A point worth noting here is that the GABAergic neurons in the SN have high firing rates. Also, the lack of KCC2 in DA neurons (see above) suggests that \( E_{GABA} \) is rather volatile in these neurons and hence likely to be subject to marked activity-induced changes.

As to long-term ionic plasticity, there are interesting observations suggesting that the efficacy of KCC2 is kinetically modulated during physiological activity (Woodin et al., 2003; Fiumelli et al., 2005). A recent study (Wang et al., 2006) has demonstrated that the reversal potential of IPSPs triggered by GP neurons in the STN is modulated in a bi-directional manner by rebound spiking: a long-lasting potentiation of IPSPs was seen in STN neurons that fired three or more spikes, whereas a long-lasting depression was seen in neurons that had 0–2 rebound spikes. Variations in the influx pathways of \( Ca^{2+} \) were shown to play a crucial role in this bi-directional IPSP plasticity, but the calcium-dependent, down-stream mechanisms — which apparently act on ion transporters — have not been identified (cf. Woodin et al., 2003; Fiumelli et al., 2005).

An example of ionic plasticity at the level of protein synthesis is provided by work on the effect of epileptiform activity on KCC2. Epileptic activity is known to produce an increase in the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its receptor TrkB (Binder et al., 2001; Huang and Reichardt, 2003). Hence, it was of much interest to find that following in vivo kindling, the expression of KCC2 shows a rapid fall in hippocampal regions where BDNF-TrkB up-regulation is most salient (Rivera et al., 2002). A direct causal link from TrkB activation to KCC2 down-regulation was established in experiments on hippocampal slices and slice cultures (Rivera et al., 2002, 2004). Work on transgenic mice with point mutations in their TrkB receptors (see Minichiello et al., 1998) showed that KCC2 down-regulation was triggered by the simultaneous activation of the two major TrkB-mediated signalling cascades, the PLCγ and Shc pathways. Interestingly, activation of the Shc cascade only led to an increase in KCC2 expression (Rivera et al., 2004), which may shed

light on the mechanisms that underlie the developmental up-regulation of KCC2. The lifetime of membrane-associated KCC2 is very short, in the range of tens of minutes (Rivera et al., 2004), which makes KCC2 well suited for mediating GABAergic long-term ionic plasticity under various kinds of physiological and pathological conditions.

### Ionic mechanisms of GABAergic inhibition in substantia nigra

#### SN pars compacta

There is little information about the ionic mechanisms that shape GABAergic actions in basal ganglia. However, a rather exceptional finding was made in recent work (Gulacsi et al., 2003) on dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) pars compacta. In contrast to most of the neurons in the CNS, these DA neurons do not express KCC2, as shown by several kinds of immunohistochemical techniques. In contrast to this, GABAergic neurons in the SN were immunopositive for KCC2, with high levels of expression in the dendritic plasma membrane close to inhibitory synapses.

Consistent with the anatomical observations, gramicidin-perforated patch clamp recordings showed that GABAergic SN neurons had a significantly more hyperpolarized \( E_{IPSP} \) than the DA neurons (Gulacsi et al., 2003). Another interesting difference between these two cell types was that the DA neurons had an abundant expression of the chloride channel, ClC-2 (see also Smith et al., 1995), while no ClC-2 protein was detected in the GABAergic neurons. Inward rectification of the current carried by ClC-2 (Staley, 1994) suggests that this channel facilitates the clearance of intracellular \( Cl^- \) following a significant chloride load (acting in a somewhat valve-like manner), which may be especially important for a neuron devoid of KCC2. However, a channel-mediated ion flux is, of course, always “downhill” along the electrochemical ion gradient, and cannot produce any driving force, such as the slightly but significantly hyperpolarizing IPSP driving force that was

observed in the DA neurons. The enigma of hyperpolarizing IPSPs was resolved by recordings in the absence of CO₂/HCO₃⁻ (in HEPES buffer) where a marked depolarizing shift in \( E_{\text{IPSP}} \) was observed, suggesting that the Cl⁻ extrusion by the Na⁺-dependent anion exchanger (NDCBE, aka NDAE; see above) was responsible for the modestly hyperpolarizing IPSPs in the DA neurons (Gulacsi et al., 2003).

The DA neurons are known to exhibit less effective GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor-mediated inhibition than GABAergic neurons of the SN. This may have a number of underlying causes (cf Chapter 8 in this volume) but, nevertheless, is in agreement with the lack of KCC2 in the former. Since neuronal damage is often associated with hyperexcitability, it is tempting (but admittedly highly speculative) to raise the question whether the lack of KCC2 plays a role in DA neuron vulnerability in Parkinson’s disease. Changes in neuronal volume are also known to have pathophysiological causes and effects (Jefferys, 1995), and even though KCC2 is not genuinely volume sensitive (see above), it responds to an increase in [Cl]i and thereby helps in maintaining a constant neuronal volume.

### Conclusion

If there is one straightforward conclusion to be drawn from the preceding sections, it might be that extrapolation of observations regarding GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor-mediated signalling in one neuron or network to another cell type or brain region is not easy. Of course, this does not mean that it should not be attempted, but rather the opposite. A comparative approach — at the level of different species or brain regions — is a fundamental strategy of neurobiological research that has generated lots of novel experimental designs and theories and helped in the identification of basic principles in the design of living systems.

For GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors in different regions of the brain and in different neurons, profound heterogeneity is seen at the level of subunit expression. This contributes to a diversity of receptor subtypes that display differences in their affinity for GABA, their conductance, their kinetics of activation and deactivation and their onset and recovery from desensitization. Such factors determine the conditions under which the receptors may be activated, the magnitude and shape of the conductance change and responses to repeated activation. The functional significance of differences in biophysical properties among receptor subtypes will depend on their location and on any variations in their exposure to GABA — be those differences in the concentration waveform of GABA at or near the synapse or the concentration of ambient GABA to which they are persistently exposed.
Finally, the magnitude and polarity of current responses (dictated by the membrane voltage and the transmembrane distribution Cl⁻ and HCO₃⁻) can vary widely, within individual neurons, between different neurons, during development and in response to physiological or pathological stimuli. Thus, despite common underlying principles of action, variations in each of the discrete steps that contribute to GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor-mediated signaling generate phenomena that are remarkably diverse and endlessly fascinating.
