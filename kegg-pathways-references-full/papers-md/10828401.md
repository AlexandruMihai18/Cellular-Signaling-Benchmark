### Abstract

The *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* serogroup O11 strain PA103 O antigen gene locus consists of 11 genes designated *wzz*, *wzx*, *wbjA*, *wzy*, *wbjB-F*, *wbpL*, and *wbpM*. The distribution of each of these genes amongst the 20 *P. aeruginosa* international antigenic typing system (IATS) serogroups was analyzed by Southern blot. As shown previously, *wbpM* was present in all 20 serogroups. The remaining O11 O antigen genes, with the exception of *wzy*, were present in the serogroup O17 strain IATSO17, despite the structural unrelatedness of the O11 and O17 O antigens. Sequencing revealed the presence of a cryptic serogroup O11 locus in the IATSO17 interrupted by two copies of a 1.1-kb insertion element. Introduction of plasmid pLPS2, containing the complete O11 O antigen locus from strain PA103, into IATSO17 resulted in production of both the O11 and O17 O antigens. The results of insertional inactivation of *wbpM* in IATSO17 are discussed.

### 1. Introduction

Bacteria synthesize a diversity of surface polysaccharides that are important structurally and as virulence determinants [1]. One of these polysaccharides, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which forms the outer leaflet of the Gram-negative outer membrane, can play a complex role in pathogenesis. *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* LPS is similar to that studied in other microorganisms and consists of three parts: lipid A; a core oligosaccharide; and a variable O antigen composed of repeating oligosaccharide subunits extending out from the cell surface. Differences in the monosaccharide composition and/or linkages between O antigen subunit sugar residues specify the 20 currently known *P. aeruginosa* international antigenic typing system (IATS) serogroups [2].

Genes that are involved in synthesis of the lipid A, LPS core, and O antigen components are typically found clustered on separate regions of the chromosome. O antigen synthesis involves a number of genes encoding enzymes involved in nucleotide sugar precursor synthesis, glycosyltransferases that assemble the O antigen subunits, and inner membrane proteins functioning in the transport and assembly of the O antigen. The genetics of O antigen biosynthesis in *P. aeruginosa* is the subject of a recent review [3].

Currently, only the *P. aeruginosa* serogroup O5 [4], O6 [5], and O11 [6] O antigen biosynthetic loci have been characterized in detail. There are substantial differences between these loci, reflecting their different O subunit structures. However, all are located on the chromosome between *himD* and *tyrB* and share an almost identical gene that is common to all 20 IATS serogroup strains. This gene, *wbpM*, is the terminal gene in the serogroup O11 and O5 loci ([6] #3434) and this was confirmed to be the case for the serogroup O6 locus as well [5].

A distinct characteristic of O antigen loci is reduced G+C content relative to the chromosomal average. This could reflect acquisition of O antigen genes from low G+C organisms [7,8]. The relative difference in G+C contents is especially pronounced in *P. aeruginosa* due to its high chromosomal G+C level (average 67%). The *wbpM* gene exhibits a much less dramatic difference in G+C content (approximately 62% vs. 45–57% for O antigen-specific genes) indicating that it may be an ancestral *P. aeruginosa* gene.

The role of WbpM has not yet been unambiguously defined. Since most O antigens possess fucosamine or qui-

novosamine, it has been proposed that WbpM is a UDP-GlcNAc dehydratase involved in synthesis of the activated forms of these sugars ([4] #2908; [9] #3890). Consistent with this, mutation of *wbpM* in IATS serogroup O15 and O17 strains, the O antigens of which lack these residues, did not eliminate O antigen synthesis [9]. This finding raises the question as to why these strains possess a *wbpM* gene.

Southern blot experiments performed while analyzing the distribution of the serogroup O11 genes among all 20 *P. aeruginosa* serogroups revealed the presence of almost all of the O11 O antigen genes in a serogroup O17 strain IATSO17. This finding suggests that in IATSO17 *wbpM* may reside on a cryptic O11 O antigen locus. This study presents the analysis of the serogroup O11 locus found in serogroup O17 in order to shed light on the presence of *wbpM* in IATSO17.

### 2. Materials and methods

#### 2.1. Bacterial strains, plasmids, and media

*P. aeruginosa* serogroup O11 strain PA103 has been previously described [10]. The *P. aeruginosa* serogroup O17 strain IATSO17 was obtained from T.L. Pitt (Central Public Health Laboratory, London, UK). *Escherichia coli* DH5α was used for all plasmid manipulations. Cosmid pLPS2 was introduced into *P. aeruginosa* by triparental mating as described previously [11]. Plasmids were introduced into *E. coli* and *P. aeruginosa* as previously described [6]. Bacteria were grown routinely in Luria broth or on L agar plates as described previously [12]. Cetrimide agar (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, MI, USA) was used to select *P. aeruginosa*. Media contained ampicillin (50–100 μg ml⁻¹ for *E. coli*), carbenicillin (250 μg ml⁻¹ for *P. aeruginosa*), gentamicin (15 μg ml⁻¹ for *E. coli*; 250 μg ml⁻¹ for *P. aeruginosa*), tetracycline (10 μg ml⁻¹ for *E. coli*; 50–100 μg ml⁻¹ for *P. aeruginosa*) and sucrose (5% w/v), as required.

#### 2.2. DNA procedures

DNA procedures were performed as previously described [6]. To construct a *wbpM* insertion mutation, a 2098-bp (accession number AF147795, position 11930–14028) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) fragment encompassing *wbpM* was generated from PA103 chromosomal DNA (on the susing Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA, USA) and ligated directly into SmaI-digested pEX100T [13]. This construct was then linearized using the unique XhoI site within *wbpM* and ligated to the gentamicin resistance determinant *aacCl*, isolated as an approximately 850-bp SalI fragment from pUCGM [14]. The knockout mutation was introduced onto the genome of IATSO17, confirmed by PCR using primers flanking the *aacCl* insertion site in *wbpM*, and by Southern blot analysis as previously described [6]. Nucleotide sequencing was performed by the University of Virginia Biomolecular Research Facility. Sequence data were analyzed using a sequencer (Gene Codes, Ann Arbor, MI, USA) and Gene Construction kit (Textco, West Lebanon, NH, USA) computer software. GenBank database searches (National Center for Biotechnology Information, Bethesda, MD, USA) were conducted using the N.C.B.I. BLAST server.

#### 2.3. LPS analysis

*P. aeruginosa* LPS was isolated, separated on 10% NuPAGE bis-tris polyacrylamide gels (Novex, Los Angeles, CA, USA), and detected by silver staining and Western immunoblots, as previously described [6,15]. Antibodies used were polyclonal antisera to *P. aeruginosa* O11 [16] and polyclonal antisera specific to *P. aeruginosa* serogroup O17 LPS (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, MI, USA).

#### 2.4. Nucleotide sequence accession number

The cryptic O11 O antigen locus of *P. aeruginosa* IATSO17 (Fig. 1A) is deposited in GenBank under the accession number AF236052. The accession number for the previously characterized serogroup O11 O antigen locus of strain PA103 is AF147795 (Fig. 1B) [6].

### 3. Results

#### 3.1. Identification of serogroup O11 genes in an IATSO17 strain

Southern blot analysis of PCR-amplified O antigen genes from the serogroup O11 strain PA103 was used to assess their distribution in all 20 *P. aeruginosa* serogroups. Consistent with previous determinations that *wbpM* is conserved in *P. aeruginosa*, the *wbpM* gene hybridized with genomic DNA from all twenty serogroup strains. Unexpectedly, given the structural dissimilarity of the O11 [-3)-α-L-FucNAc-(1-3)-β-D-FucNAc-(1-2)-β-D-Glc-(1-] and O17 [-β-D-ManNAc-(1-4)-α-L Rha-(1−] O antigens [2], all of the remaining O11 O antigen genes, with the exception of a fragment derived from the 5′ half of *wzy*, were present in the serogroup O17 strain IATSO17. This finding suggested that there could be a cryptic O11 O antigen locus within IATSO17 and that the conserved *wbpM* gene may reside within this locus.

To investigate this possibility, oligonucleotide primers derived from the PA103 O11 O antigen locus were used to generate overlapping PCR fragments from the chromosome of IATSO17 that encompassed the homologous region. The nucleotide sequence of these fragments was determined. This confirmed the presence of a cryptic O11 O

Comparison of homologous O antigen genetic regions from *P. aeruginosa* serogroup O17 strain IATSO17 (accession number AF236052) (A) and serogroup O11 strain PA103 (accession number AF147795) (B). Open reading frames are indicated as arrows. In the IATSO17 sequence (A), insertion element ISPal1A is inserted into the *wzx* (O antigen transporter) gene; ISPal1B replaces the 3′ region of the *wbjA* (encoding a putative glucosyltransferase) gene, (referred to as *wbjA′*) and almost the entire *wzy* (O antigen polymerase) gene (referred to as *'wzy*). A mutation leading to a truncation of the *wbjF* gene product was also noted (referred to as *wbjF′*). Shown below is the insert DNA in the plasmid pCD203, which is pUCP18 [23] containing an approximately 3.5-kb EcoRI–MluI PA103 genomic DNA fragment, encompassing *wbpM* in the same orientation as the *lac* promoter.

### 3.2. Organization of the cryptic O11 O antigen locus in IATSO17

Fig. 1 shows a comparison of the cryptic serogroup O11 gene locus found in the *P. aeruginosa* IATSO17 to that of the previously characterized O11 locus of *P. aeruginosa* strain PA103 [6]. Both loci are flanked by the *himD* and *tyrB* genes, similar to the O5 [4,6] and O6 O antigen loci [5]. A nonsense mutation in the cryptic locus in IATSO17 results in a 13-amino acid truncation of the *wbjF* gene product. Two copies of an approximately 1.1-kb IS element are located within the cryptic O11 locus in IATSO17. One, ISPal1A, is inserted into the O antigen transporter gene *wzx* at a single site, and the other, ISPal1B, replaces a fragment encompassing the 3′ half of *wbjA* (a putative glucosyltransferase [17]) and most of the O antigen polymerase gene *wzy*. Using PCR, the presence of O11-specific genes was confirmed in two additional serogroup O17 strains (ATCC33364 and ATCC49269) obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (data not shown). ISPal1A and ISPal1B are identical to one another and show 83% nucleotide sequence identity to IS1394 from *Pseudomonas alcaligenes*. IS1394 belongs to the IS30 family of transposable elements [18]. Based on this and the presence of 27-bp imperfect terminal inverted repeats typical of IS30 family IS elements [19], ISPal1A and ISPal1B are members of the IS30 family.

### 3.3. Coexpression of serogroup O11 and O17 O antigens

In order to see if an intact serogroup O11 O antigen locus could direct synthesis of the O11 O antigen in IATSO17, plasmid pLPS2, containing the entire O11 locus from strain PA103 [11] was introduced into IATSO17.

Similar to what has been found for other serogroup strains [20], IATSO17(pLPS2) coexpressed the serogroup O17 and serogroup O11 O antigens (Fig. 2, lane 3) indicating that a complete O11 locus could mediate synthesis of the O11 LPS in this strain. Therefore, if the disrupted cryptic O11 locus within IATSO17 was ever intact, both the O11 and O17 O antigens may have been produced.

### 3.4. Mutation of *wbpM* in IATSO17

It is unlikely that serogroup O11-specific genes of the cryptic O11 O antigen locus in IATSO17 contribute to O17 O antigen synthesis. However, the *wbpM* gene is conserved in all *P. aeruginosa* serogroups, therefore it is not serogroup-specific, and could play some role in LPS synthesis in IATSO17. Therefore, *wbpM* was inactivated by insertion of a gentamicin resistance gene and knocked out on the IATSO17 chromosome using the *sacB*-mediated positive selection gene replacement vector pEX100T [13].

the various O antigens in *P. aeruginosa* may have resulted  
in part from acquisition of serospecific O antigen genes,  
which recombined between *himD* and the conserved *wbpm*  
gene. This is likely true for most of the serogroups, how-  
ever the demonstration here that a non-functional, cryptic  
serogroup O11 O antigen locus resides in this location in  
IATSO17 indicates that another locus or loci, not located  
between *himD* and *tyrB*, is responsible for O17 O antigen  
synthesis.

The presence of the cryptic O11 locus in IATSO17  
could be explained by lateral transfer of the O11 locus  
to IATSO17 from a serogroup O11 *P. aeruginosa* strain  
or, alternatively, that IATSO17 was previously a se-  
rogroup O11 strain that evolved or acquired an O17 locus  
and lost the capacity to make the O11 O antigen through  
IS element insertions in the O11 locus. If laterally trans-  
ferred, the presence of the cryptic O11 O antigen locus,  
which itself shows clear derivation from Gram-positive  
capsule biosynthetic loci [6], in IATSO17 provides a strik-  
ing example of the genetic mobility and rearrangement  
presumed to occur in polysaccharide biosynthetic loci.  
Furthermore, it is interesting to note that the *P. aerugino-  
sa* serogroup O17 O antigen structure is identical to the  
*Burkholderia cepacia* serogroup O5 O antigen [21], suggest-  
ing genes directing O17 O antigen synthesis in IATSO17  
may also be present in this serogroup of *B. cepacia*, pos-  
sibly the result of lateral transfer between these two or-  
ganisms. To gain more insight into this phenomenon,  
identification and characterization of these genes in IAT-  
SO17 and *B. cepacia* is currently underway.

Conservation of *wbpm* in *P. aeruginosa* has been pro-  
posed to reflect its involvement in synthesis of the fucos-  
amine and quinovosamine residues widely distributed in  
*P. aeruginosa* O antigens. Therefore, mutation of *wbpm*  
in serogroup O15 and O17 strains, which lack these sugars  
in their O antigens, should have no effect on O antigen  
synthesis. Consistent with this Burrows et al. [9] recently  
reported the construction of *wbpm* knockout mutations in  
serogroups O15 and O17 strains that had no effect on O  
antigen synthesis. The result presented here for the IAT-  
SO17 *wbpm* mutant M1 parallels this finding, however the  
observation that IATSO17 *wbpm* mutant M2 had lost O  
antigen indicates a possible role for WbpM in O17 LPS  
synthesis. PCR and Southern blot analyses confirmed the  
insert in both M1 and M2 with no obvious genomic re-  
arrangements that could explain the different phenotypes.  
Furthermore, the presence of only a single elevated band,  
consistent with the size of the *aacCl* insertion, in each  
mutant in diagnostic PCR and Southern blot, with no  
remaining band corresponding to that observed for the  
parent strain (data not shown), indicates that IATSO17  
has only a single copy of the *wbpm* gene.

The emergence of two phenotypes upon mutation of  
*wbpm* in IATSO17 suggests that a secondary mutation  
has occurred in one of the two isolates. Secondary muta-  
tions arising from mutation of an O antigen gene have

The *sacB* gene on pEX100T renders Gram-negative bac-  
teria sensitive to sucrose allowing for the direct selection  
of recombinants devoid of vector DNA on media contain-  
ing sucrose and gentamicin. After passage on sucrose-gen-  
tamycin plates, two colonies, designated M1 and M2, were  
picked for further analysis. Both M1 and M2 were sensi-  
tive to carbenicillin, confirming loss of the pEX100T vec-  
tor-associated DNA. PCR and Southern blot analyses  
confirmed the presence of the gentamicin resistance deter-  
minant within *wbpm* in both M1 and M2 (data not  
shown).

M1 and M2 were analyzed for the ability to produce the  
O17 O antigen. Mutant M1 produced normal LPS (Fig. 3,  
lane 2), while mutant M2 was devoid of O antigen (Fig. 3,  
lane 3). Normal LPS synthesis was restored in M2 by  
plasmid pCD203 (Fig. 1), containing *wbpm* (Fig. 3, lane  
4), but not the cloning vector (Fig. 3, lane 5), indicating  
that the defect in LPS synthesis in M2 was real and re-  
sulted solely from the loss of *wbpm*. This indicated the  
possibility that a secondary mutation occurred in M1 re-  
storing O17 O antigen synthesis. To eliminate the possi-  
bility that the complementation by *wbpm* observed for M2  
(Fig. 3, lane 4) resulted from fortuitous isolation of a  
similar compensatory mutation, pCD203 was isolated  
from M2(pCD203) and retransformed into M2. The re-  
sulting strain again produced the O17 O antigen while a  
second transformation with the cloning vector did not  
complement the O antigen defect (data not shown).

4. Discussion

The three currently described O antigen loci of *P. aeru-  
ginosa* reside between *himD* and *tyrB* on the chromosome  
and have a nearly identical terminal gene, *wbpm*, that is  
conserved in all 20 IATS serogroups. This suggests that
been previously reported; stresses created by mutation of the O antigen transporter gene *wzx* in *P. aeruginosa* serogroup O5 resulted in accumulation of secondary mutations [22]. In the case of the IATSO17 *wbpM* mutant M2 reported here, the ability of plasmid-borne *wbpM* to restore wild-type LPS synthesis suggests that the M2 mutant is real and that the defect in LPS results only from the mutation of *wbpM*. A secondary mutation leading to LPS restoration may have occurred in the IATSO17 *wbpM* mutant M1. This phenomenon may explain the differences between the IATSO17 *wbpM* mutants M1 and M2, and may account for the lack of effect of *wbpM* on O antigen synthesis in the serogroup O17 mutant described by Burrows et al. [9]. We are currently investigating the nature of this compensatory mutation.
