### ABSTRACT

Mutationally activated and oncogenic versions of the *ras* genes were first identified in human tumors in 1982. This discovery prompted great interest in the development of anti-Ras strategies as novel, target-based approaches for cancer treatment. The three human *ras* genes represent the most frequently mutated oncogenes in human cancers. Consequently, a considerable research effort has been made to define the function of Ras in normal and neoplastic cells and to target Ras for cancer treatment. Among the anti-Ras strategies that are under evaluation in the clinic are pharmacologic inhibitors designed to prevent: (1) association with the plasma membrane (farnesyltransferase inhibitors), (2) downstream signaling (Raf and MEK protein kinase inhibitors), (3) autocrine growth factor signaling (EGF receptor inhibitors), or (4) gene expression (*H-ras* and *c-raf-1*). Although a number of these inhibitors have demonstrated potent anti-tumor activities in preclinical models, phase I–III clinical trials have revealed unexpected complexities in Ras function and in the clinical development of target-based therapies. We review the current status of anti-Ras drug development, issues that have complicated their progression to the clinic, and possible future strategies for targeting Ras.

### INTRODUCTION—RAS AS A TARGET FOR ANTI-CANCER TREATMENT

Overall, mutated *ras* alleles are found in 30% of all human cancers, with high frequencies seen in cancers with limited therapeutic options and poor survival, including cancers of the lung and pancreas (30–90%).<sup>1</sup> Ras is also activated in cancer cells by other mechanisms, including by perturbations in other signaling components, such as receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs).<sup>2</sup> In particular, the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is overexpressed or mutationally activated in many human cancers, and hyperactivation of EGFR tyrosine kinase activity in turn causes persistent activation of Ras and Ras-mediated signaling. Hence, the involvement of Ras in cancers extends significantly beyond those where *ras* is activated by mutation.

That Ras can play an essential role in tumor maintenance and is therefore an appropriate target for anticancer therapy is clear.<sup>3</sup> Further, the ability of oncogenic Ras to reduce the expression of tumor suppressor genes such as p16 via promoter methylation<sup>4</sup> suggests that anti-Ras drugs may also provide anti-tumor benefits by reactivation of lost tumor suppressor function.

The rational development of anti-Ras drugs requires understanding the function of Ras proteins in normal cells and how this function is usurped in cancer cells. Intensive basic research studies have achieved much of this goal and our understanding of Ras function is now immense, albeit still far from complete.<sup>2</sup> We presently have a detailed picture of the role of Ras in signal transduction and the mechanisms by which Ras regulates cell proliferation, survival, and differentiation. This information has guided current strategies designed to antagonize different facets of Ras important for its oncogenic function: association with the inner face of the plasma membrane, activation of a protein kinase cascade, induction of growth factor production, and gene expression. These approaches are under evaluation in clinical trials and many more are under investigation in preclinical studies. However, despite two decades of effort, no anti-Ras strategies have yet reached common clinical practice. Are the current approaches the wrong ones? Is Ras a poor target? Or is success just around the corner? These questions cannot be answered yet, partly because such development has been complicated by two issues. First, while our knowledge of Ras function is now considerable, it has become clear that Ras biochemistry and biology is much more complex than had been imagined, and we still remain ignorant of many aspects of Ras function. Second, the clinical development of target-based drugs for cancer

Figure 1. Ras proteins function as regulated GDP/GTP switches. The three human ras genes encode four highly related (85% sequence identity) proteins, H-Ras, N-Ras, and two K-Ras proteins due to alternative exon splicing (4A and 4B). Extracellular stimuli that mediate their effects through interaction with a variety of cell surface receptors, for example receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), cause activation of Ras by stimulating GEFs which promote formation of active, Ras-GTP. Activated Ras-GTP then recognizes and regulates various downstream effectors (E), which in turn regulate different cytoplasmic signaling cascades that regulate diverse facets of cell biology.

treatment is a young endeavor that requires approaches distinct from those traditionally used for the development of conventional cytotoxic anti-cancer drugs. In this review, we summarize the current status of anti-Ras strategies and discuss how these two issues have complicated current efforts to apply such strategies to the cancer patient.

### RAS PROTEINS ARE CRITICAL RELAY SWITCHES IN SIGNAL TRANSDUCTION—STUCK IN THE "ON" POSITION IN HUMAN CANCERS

Ras proteins function as regulated GDP/GTP switches that cycle between inactive GDP-bound and active GTP-bound states (Fig. 1). The extracellular stimuli that promote Ras activation are diverse and regulate the actions of many cell surface receptors, including receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), nonreceptor tyrosine kinase-associated receptors, G protein-coupled receptors, and integrins. In quiescent cells, Ras exists predominantly in the GDP-bound state. When cells are stimulated by a diverse spectrum of extracellular stimuli, Ras is converted to the GTP-bound state. The Ras GDP/GTP cycle is controlled by two classes of regulatory proteins. Guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) stimulate formation of Ras-GTP, whereas GTPase activating proteins (GAPs) stimulate hydrolysis of the bound GTP to return Ras to the inactive GDP-bound state. These regulators dictate that normal Ras is activated transiently and in a stimulus-dependent fashion. In contrast, the mutated ras alleles found in cancer cells harbor missense mutations (at residues 12, 13 or 61) that render Ras insensitive to GAPs, resulting in mutant proteins that are persistently activated in the absence of extracellular signals. Among the first efforts to design anti-Ras compounds were attempts to selectively target these biochemical differences between normal and mutated Ras by rescuing the defective GTPase activity. While there is support for the feasibility of such endeavors, there has been little success to date. Nevertheless, this remains a tantalizing approach for anti-Ras drug discovery. Other ways of targeting selectively the mutated forms of Ras include short peptide vaccines made against specific codon 12 mutations.

### TARGETING DOWNSTREAM SIGNALING—INHIBITORS OF THE MITOGEN-ACTIVATED PROTEIN KINASE (MAPK) CASCADE

The GTP-bound state of Ras defines its activated state by virtue of its enhanced ability to bind to and regulate downstream effector targets. Of these, the best characterized are the Raf serine/threonine kinases (Fig. 2). Ras association with Raf initiates events that lead to activation of Raf, the head of the Raf/MEK/ERK kinase cascade, which is a major signaling pathway downstream of Ras. Activated Raf phosphorylates and activates the MEK1 and MEK2 dual specificity kinases, which in turn phosphorylate and activate the ERK1 and ERK2 MAPKs. Activated ERKs traverse from the cytoplasm to the nucleus where they phosphorylate a variety of substrates, including members of the Ets family of transcription factors (e.g., Elk-1). The critical role of this pathway as a rational target for anticancer therapy is supported by the recent identification of mutated, activated B-Raf in melanomas and in colon cancers.

Inhibitors of the Ras/Raf/MEK pathway have been actively sought and developed as possible anticancer agents. PD98059 and U0126 are two selective inhibitors of MEK1/2 kinase activity that have been utilized extensively in cell culture studies to assess the contribution of ERK activation to Ras signaling and transformation. The ability of these compounds to block the growth of Ras-transformed cells has provided validation for MEK as a target for cancer treatment. Additional evidence is provided by studies showing that a MEK dominant negative inhibited the anchorage-independent growth of a variety of human tumor cells in cell culture, and showed anti-tumor activity in xenograft studies in immunocompromised mice.

Recently, a highly potent, selective and orally active MEK inhibitor, CI-1040 (formerly PD184352), has been described (Fig. 3). Preclinical studies showed that treatment with this inhibitor reduced tumor growth as much as 80% in mice with colon carcinomas of either mouse or human origin. Efficacy was achieved with a wide range of doses with no signs of overt toxicity, and was correlated with a reduction in the levels of activated, phosphorylated

Figure 2. Ras effector-mediated signaling targets specific gene expression. The three best-characterized effectors of Ras are Raf serine/threonine kinases, PI3-K lipid kinases, and Ral guanine nucleotide exchange factors (RalGEFs). PI3-K activates the Akt serine/threonine kinase, which can activate the NF-κB transcription factor. The PTEN tumor suppressor protein is a lipid phosphatase that antagonizes the action of PI3-K. RalGEF activates the Ral small GTPase, and stimulates activation of the AFX forkhead transcription factor.

ERK in tumors excised from treated animals. CI-1040 is currently under evaluation in phase I clinical trials in patients with advanced cancers. Plasma concentrations of the drug sufficient to cause complete inhibition of stimulated ERK activity in peripheral blood leukocytes (PBLs) have been achieved consistently, and one patient with pancreatic cancer achieved a partial response lasting at least 16 months.¹⁶ Mild toxicities included fatigue, rash, and diarrhea.

Inhibitors of the Raf kinase have now also reached clinical trials (Fig. 3). One Raf inhibitor, BAY 43-9006, was discovered using a combination of medicinal and combinatorial chemistry approaches.¹⁴ Preclinical evaluation determined that BAY 43-9006 inhibited the growth of both *ras* mutation-positive and -negative human tumor cell lines in cell culture and in mouse xenograft studies. Evaluation of BAY 43-9006 in combination with standard chemotherapeutic agents in xenograft models showed improved efficacy over either alone.¹⁷ BAY 43-9006 is currently undergoing Phase I clinical trials. In one study of advanced stage cancer patients, dose-limiting toxicity was diarrhea; other toxicities seen were rash, pancreatitis, and fatigue. Prolonged stabilization of disease was seen in some patients and a partial response was seen in one patient. As with the MEK inhibitor CI-1040, phospho-ERK inhibition in PBLs was used successfully as a surrogate marker for anti-Raf kinase activity of BAY 43-9006.¹⁸

Recently, a novel class of inhibitor of Ras transformation was identified in a yeast two-hybrid-based screen for inhibitors of the interaction of Ras with Raf. MCP1 and related compounds inhibited Ras but not Raf transformation in model cell systems and in human tumor cell lines in vitro.¹⁹ While inhibitors of protein-protein interaction have met with limited success in drug discovery, the MCP compounds may define a novel mechanism by which Ras function

important Ras effector pathway for blocking Ras oncogenesis in cancer patients? Should inhibitors of other effector pathways be considered for anti-Ras drug development? Will achieving good anti-tumor efficacy with such drugs require the concurrent inhibition of multiple Ras effector pathways?

## ATTEMPTS TO INHIBIT RAS MEMBRANE ASSOCIATION—FARNESYL TRANSFERASE INHIBITORS

Ras proteins are positioned at the inner face of the plasma membrane where they serve as key regulatory switches to relay the signal from activated receptors to cytoplasmic signaling cascades. Because membrane association is critical for Ras function, the development of compounds intended to inhibit Ras membrane association has been pursued vigorously. Farnesyltransferase inhibitors (FTIs) target the enzyme farnesyltransferase (FTase) that post-translationally modifies the Ras oncoprotein, rather than Ras itself (Fig. 3 and Fig. 4). Ras proteins are synthesized initially in the cytosol (Fig. 4). They then undergo a rapid series of modifications that are signaled by the CAAX tetrapeptide motif present at the carboxyl termini of all Ras proteins, where C = cysteine, A = aliphatic and X = any amino acid-farnesylated cysteine. Farnesylation is the obligate first step required for all three modifications. Therefore, although inhibitors have been developed against all three CAAX-recognized enzymes, and the genetic loss of either Rce or Icmt suggests the possibility of reduced transforming activity, FTase has been viewed as the most attractive target and has been the most intensively evaluated. The development of FTIs has been reviewed thoroughly.

FTIs are potent inhibitors of H-Ras farnesylation and activity. Initial analyses of FTIs involved determining their ability to block only the farnesylation of H-Ras, rather than of the K- and N-Ras isoforms most frequently mutated in human cancers. Unfortunately, later observations revealed an unanticipated property of Ras protein function. While FTIs can block the farnesylation of all Ras isoforms in vitro enzyme assays, they failed to effectively block the isoprenoid modification and membrane association of K-Ras and N-Ras in cells. This is due to the fact that, when FTase is blocked by FTIs, both K-Ras and N-Ras can serve as substrates for a related enzyme, GGTTase I, whereas H-Ras cannot. Since GGTTase I-mediated addition of a related lipid, the geranylgeranyl isoprenoid, allows Ras to retain function, K-Ras and N-Ras can effectively escape inhibition by FTIs by undergoing this alternative prenylation (Fig. 4). In early preclinical studies, FTIs were effective inhibitors of the tumorigenic growth of a wide range of human tumor cell lines, independent of ras mutation status. These observations, together with those showing FTI inhibition of K- and N-Ras transformed cell growth without inhibition of Ras membrane association, provided strong evidence that the anti-tumor activity of FTIs may involve targets in addition to, or instead of, Ras proteins. There has long been significant evidence that a Ras-related protein, RhoB, is a target involved in FTI anti-tumor activity, particularly for the apoptosis-inducing effects (reviewed in ref. 41). However, there is also evidence to suggest that RhoB cannot be the only physiologically relevant target of FTIs. Hence, an important goal of current FTI development is the identification of these additional FTI targets. Nevertheless, one study showed that isoform-specific Ras-GTP levels predict astrocytoma responsiveness. FTIs have now been evaluated in phase I (L778,123 and BMS-214662) and phase II-III trials (R115777/tipifarnib/Zarnestra, SCH66336/lonafarnib/Sarasar). Unlike the mouse studies, in which no overt toxicity was identified, some patient toxicity has been observed, including reversible myelosuppression and fatigue. L778,123 is no longer being put forward for trials due to

Figure 4. Ras processing and association with the plasma membrane. All Ras proteins are synthesized initially as cytosolic, inactive proteins. They undergo a rapid series of posttranslational modifications signaled by the carboxyl terminal CAAX tetrapeptide sequence: FTase-mediated addition of the C15 farnesyl isoprenoid (F), endoproteolytic cleavage (by Ras converting enzyme, Rce1) of the AAX residues, and methylation (by isoprenylcysteine methyltransferase, Icmt) of the now-terminal farnesylated cysteine residue. Inhibitors of all three steps have been described, but only FTase inhibitors (FTIs) have been advanced to evaluation in clinical trials. Although designed initially as an inhibitor of the methyltransferase modification, farnesylthiosalicylic acid (FTS) instead blocks Ras transformation by a mechanism that remains poorly understood, but is thought to involve dislodging Ras from membrane docking site(s). K-Ras4B and N-Ras proteins undergo alternative prenylation when FTase activity is blocked by farnesyltransferase inhibitors (FTIs), resulting in their modification by a C20 geranylgeranyl isoprenoid (GG) and continued activity. Alterations in the activity of other farnesylated targets of FTase, such as RhoB and others yet to be determined, are thought to explain much of the antitumor activity of FTIs.

structure-related cardiac toxicity. Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) for R115777 has been reported to be either neutropenia or neuropathy<sup>51</sup> depending on the trial, whereas gastrointestinal toxicity was the DLT for SCH 66336;<sup>52</sup> both of these drugs are orally bioavailable. BMS-214662 is currently given intravenously due to gastrointestinal and hepatic toxicity when given orally.<sup>50</sup> Interestingly, BMS-214662 appears to have an additional activity that allows it to be cytotoxic rather than simply cytostatic, thus distinguishing it from the other FTIs.<sup>53</sup>

Although FTIs are not truly anti-Ras drugs, they certainly have clinical activity even in tumors with mutated *ras*. Initial phase I studies provided hints of efficacy, with occasional partial and complete responses reported. Because FTIs were designed as anti-Ras drugs, initial phase II trial designs focused on tumor types where *ras* was mutated. This may have unintentionally caused weaker results than if FTI mechanisms had been better understood earlier. Objective responses with R115777/Zarnestra and SCH66336/Sarasar were seen even in such tumors as non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and colorectal cancer.<sup>54,55</sup> Available evidence points to FTI utility as a single agent in myeloid leukemias, where complete responses have been seen in otherwise refractory patients.<sup>56</sup> FTI activity in solid tumors is currently best achieved in combination, particularly with taxanes<sup>57</sup> and with radiation,<sup>58</sup> where there is substantial preclinical evidence for these combinations.<sup>59-63</sup> Other tumor types that may be particularly responsive include head and neck, glioma, and breast cancers.<sup>46-50,55,64</sup>

Much effort is being devoted to optimizing the types of trials that will unmask the best ways in which to use this new class of drug. These trials are accompanied by examination of a variety of surrogate markers, including measurement of inhibition of the FTase enzyme itself, as well as appearance of the unprocessed forms of H-Ras, the chaperone protein HDJ-2 and the nuclear structural protein lamin A.<sup>52</sup> Whether these accurately measure the ability of FTIs to block the function of critical FTase substrate(s) in tumor cells remains an unanswered but important issue.

Currently, the development of inhibitors of the other CAAX processing steps has not advanced sufficiently to validate their usefulness in blocking Ras transformation.<sup>65</sup> One intriguing compound, a structural analog of the farnesylated cysteine (S-trans-trans-farnesylthiosalicylic acid; FTS), was originally tested as a possible inhibitor of the carboxymethylation step. While FTS has shown potent anti-Ras activity in preclinical studies, its mechanism of action is clearly not by inhibition of methylation. Instead, FTS may inhibit Ras association with a membrane protein(s) that serves as a docking site for farnesylated Ras (Fig. 4).<sup>66</sup>

The use of inhibitors of the related enzyme GGTase I (GGTIs) has been considered as one way to overcome alternative isoprenylation of K-Ras and N-Ras. Some preclinical studies have provided support for this approach.<sup>31,67</sup> However, others argue that GGTIs may be too toxic for this purpose.<sup>68</sup> It is possible that such differences are compound-related. If so, then GGTIs may be useful for targeting Rho family GTPases, Ras-related proteins that have been implicated

in tumor cell invasion and metastases.⁶⁹ For example, there is considerable evidence that Rac1/3, RhoA/C, and Cdc42 Rho GTPases are required for the oncogenic properties of Ras and other oncogenes,⁶⁹ and these Ras family proteins are substrates for GGTase I. Other Ras family proteins, such as those of the R-Ras/TC21/M-Ras family, are also GGTase I substrates, and may be targets for anticancer treatment.⁷⁰

# INHIBITORS OF HER FAMILY CELL SURFACE RECEPTORS

Oncogenic Ras transformation of a wide variety of rodent and human cell lines is associated with the upregulation of expression of TGF alpha and other epidermal growth factor (EGF) peptide ligands (Fig. 2).⁷¹ These growth factors stimulate the EGF receptor (EGFR; also called HER1 or ErbB1). This creates an autocrine growth loop whereby Ras-transformed cells synthesize growth factors to which they then respond. In many cases, perturbation of this autocrine loop inhibits Ras transformation. Consequently, inhibitors of EGFR function have also been considered as another means to block Ras transformation. Additionally, one major downstream action of EGFR stimulation is activation of Ras and the Raf/MEK/ERK cascade. Thus, inhibitors of Ras have also been considered as one approach for treatment of human cancers where the EGFR is hyperactivated by overexpression or by mutational activation.

EGFR antagonists include both anti-EGFR antibodies (e.g., IMC-C225, ABX-EGF, EMD 7200) and small molecule inhibitors of the EGF receptor tyrosine kinase activity (e.g., IRESSA, Tarceva™, CI-1033, EKB-569) (Fig. 3), as has been described in several excellent recent reviews.⁷²⁻⁷⁵ A number of these inhibitors are now under evaluation in phase III clinical trials and several are anticipated to enter the marketplace within the coming year. Although the appropriate target populations are not entirely clear, EGFR overexpression is commonly seen both in tumors where ras is not commonly mutated, such as ovarian, cervical, breast, esophageal, renal and prostate cancers, as well as in ras-mutated tumors such as colon, lung and pancreatic cancers. While it is clear that autocrine growth loops are a common feature of human cancers, whether blocking such loops will be an efficacious approach to block tumors with mutated ras has not been verified.

# OTHER ANTI-RAS STRATEGIES—ANTISENSE AND BEYOND

Targeting gene expression directly has also been tried (Fig. 3).⁷⁶ ISIS 2503 is a 20-base antisense phosphorothioate oligodeoxyribonucleotide that specifically downregulated H-ras expression and inhibited tumor cell growth in preclinical studies. Continuous intravenous infusion of ISIS 2503 evaluated in a phase I study showed that ISIS 2503 was well tolerated. However, levels of H-ras mRNA in circulating peripheral blood lymphocytes were not decreased consistently.⁷⁷ A phase II trial in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) was begun on the basis of ISIS 2503 preclinical activity against K-ras mutant-positive xenografts such as Calu-1 (lung) and MIAPaCa-2 (pancreas). In this study, 7 of 20 evaluable patients had stable disease, but there were no objective responses.⁷⁸ A related approach has been antisense inhibition of c-raf-1. A 20-base phosphorothioate oligonucleotide complementary to c-raf-1 mRNA (ISIS 5132; CGP69846A) has been shown to specifically suppress Raf-1 expression both in vitro and in vivo.⁷⁹ A liposomal formulation of antisense c-Raf-1 to improve pharmacodynamics has also

been evaluated.⁸⁰ These agents are currently under assessment in phase II clinical trials; to date, no efficacy has been reported. An obvious limitation of both of these antisense approaches is that they target isoforms of Ras or Raf that are not mutated frequently in human cancers. It remains to be seen whether antisense oligonucleotides that target K-ras or B-raf will be more advantageous. Recently, the use of short interfering RNA (siRNA) to selectively inhibit the expression of K-ras with a specific mutation (G12V), but not normal K-ras, has been described. The retrovirus-based delivery of this siRNA caused inhibition of growth in vitro and in vivo of a K-ras(G12V) mutation-positive human pancreatic cancer cell line.⁸¹ Whether expression of the normal K-ras allele was also inhibited has not been demonstrated.

Anti-sense or siRNA methods for blocking Ras are still in the very early phases of development and analysis. While promising, these approaches will be restricted by the current general limitations of antisense therapy, namely efficiency of delivery, cell uptake, selectivity, and gene silencing. Several of the studies described above also illustrate two potential disadvantages to evaluating target-based treatments by current clinical trial protocols: first, the treatment may have some efficacy that is not related to the intended target (e.g., FTIs targeting leukemias and gliomas, H-ras antisense targeting NSCLC), yet current trials are not designed to take advantage of any such activities, and second, beneficial activity of such agents may not be successfully identified by these methods. New trial designs with different endpoints will likely be required to fully appreciate the benefits of target-based treatments.

# CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE PROSPECTS

The impressive preclinical findings with FTIs generated considerable excitement and optimism that anti-Ras strategies would lead the way to the identification of effective and selective target-based anti-cancer drugs. The revelation that FTIs are neither blockbuster cytotoxic drugs nor work by blocking Ras itself has caused some initial disappointment and confusion, but should not dampen enthusiasm either for FTIs as anticancer drugs or for continued discovery efforts towards true anti-Ras therapies. It has become very clear that our standard approaches for clinical evaluation of conventional cytotoxic drugs cannot be applied to the evaluation of target-based drugs. Of particular importance is whether tumor regression is the most appropriate measure of drug efficacy. Perhaps prolonged survival and quality of life are more appropriate indicators of the anti-tumor efficacy of target-based cytostatic drugs.⁸²

Additionally, as with other anti-cancer drugs, target-based therapies are likely to be most effective when applied as part of a combinatorial regimen. Thus, targeting of agents that block the function of Ras itself or of its signaling pathways may be best accomplished in the context of also targeting specific additional characteristics that distinguish tumor cells from normal cells, for example the loss of DNA repair enzyme activity that makes tumor cells more sensitive to DNA damaging agents.⁸³ This may be one reason why combinations of cytotoxics and FTIs achieve greater efficacy than either alone. But many successful combination chemotherapy approaches were established empirically. Will this be the case with anti-Ras drugs, making the process long and unpredictable?

Another important issue is the choice of surrogate markers for monitoring drug action. Signaling activities tightly linked to Ras function in cell culture, such as ERK activation, are not always linked in tumors,²⁷ and may not always be a reliable marker for

anti-Ras drug efficacy, although ERK activation does seem to correlate with inhibitors of downstream kinases. It is also not certain that the drug inhibitory activity seen in surrogate tissues, such as PBLs, reliably reflects drug action in the tumor itself. Studies to assess these parameters are continuing.

Another issue regarding the different anti-Ras approaches currently being tried in the clinic is that none is truly selective for the cancer cell. The function of normal Ras and its signaling pathways are also vital for normal cell physiology. Hence, the hope is that cancer cells are more dependent on Ras signaling, such that partial inhibition by drug treatment will be sufficient to impede oncogenesis, but spare sufficient activity to maintain functions required for normal cell biology. There is some suspicion that the function of mutated Ras does not simply represent excessive activity of normal Ras; if so, this may provide another window to selectivity of future anti-Ras drugs.

If FTIs are not inhibitors of Ras, then what other directions might achieve this goal? A major development that has complicated current anti-Ras drug discovery efforts has been the revelation of surprising and unexpected complexities in Ras function. The fact that the prenylation of H-Ras, but not of K-Ras or N-Ras, can be blocked by FTIs was not anticipated. That Ras-mediated oncogenesis would involve pathways beyond the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway seemed unlikely in 1994, yet now presents a new challenge to anti-Ras drug development. Will inhibitors of the RalGEF or Tiam1 pathways be better options? It is too soon yet to handicap whether kinase inhibitors of Raf and MEK will work as anti-Ras and anti-neoplastic drugs. The success of antisense approaches will be tightly linked to the major technical hurdles that still face gene therapy. Rho GTPases, yet another family of Ras-related proteins, have been linked to Ras oncogenesis. Will targeting Rho GTPases and their signaling pathways be a fruitful approach to block Ras in oncogenesis? As we continue to unravel the complexities of Ras signaling, and in particular the identification of specific gene targets of Ras signaling, perhaps more promising targets will be identified. Meanwhile, the status of Ras as a critical anti-cancer target will continue to stimulate efforts towards the development of true anti-Ras drugs.
