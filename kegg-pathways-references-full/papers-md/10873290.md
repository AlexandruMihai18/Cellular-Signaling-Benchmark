Electrotonic coupling among neurons in the vertebrate, and more specifically the mammalian, brain has now been demonstrated to exist in all major brain subdivisions and in the spinal cord. For many of these brain areas, recent studies have investigated the possibilities of modulation of that coupling by synaptically released transmitters and/or neuromodulators. Reviewed here is the evidence for coupling, the synaptically related factors that play roles in up- or downregulation of this type of intercellular interaction and, to the extent that they have been investigated, the intracellular mechanisms operative in changing the extent of coupled networks in the brain. The functional significance of coupling and its modulation is discussed for some of these areas.

INTRODUCTION  

Recognition of the existence of electrotonic coupling among neurons in the mammalian central nervous system (CNS) came about less than three decades ago, with its discovery in the rat mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus (Baker and Llinás, 1971). With the hindsight that the intervening years provided, during which little attention was paid to these and similar subsequent findings, one gets the undeniable impression that this discovery was unwelcome among the community of brain electrophysiologists. Apparently, investigating membrane and synaptic phenomena in central neurons was difficult enough without having to consider another path for injected currents to follow or another mechanism by which cells might interact electrically. As long as this coupling among neurons was only in a few restricted areas of the brain, it could be relegated to the ‘odd case’ category and ignored. Times have changed. Evidence for the existence of electrotonic coupling among neurons in adult animals is now available for a wide variety of vertebrate central nervous system areas. At the time of writing, these areas include the following: in the forebrain, the external plexiform (Landis et al., 1974) and internal granular layers (Reyher et al., 1991) of the olfactory bulb, piriform cortex (De Zeeuw et al., 1995), neocortex (Sloper, 1972; Gutnick and Prince, 1981), hippocampus (MacVicar and Dudek, 1981), dentate gyrus (MacVicar and Dudek, 1982), dorsal septal nucleus (Phelen et al., 1993), nucleus accumbens (O'Donnell and Grace, 1993), striatum (Cepeda et al., 1989), the Islands of Calleja (Ribak and Fallon, 1982) and that extension of the brain, the retina (see Vaney, 1994); in the diencephalon, the paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei (Andrew et al., 1981); in the midbrain/brainstem, the mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus (Baker and Llinás, 1971), cerebellar cortex (Sotelo and Llinás, 1972), substantia nigra (Grace and Bunney, 1983), locus coeruleus (Travagli et al., 1995), ventral and dorsal cochlear nuclei (Sotelo et al., 1976; Wouterlood et al., 1984), inferior olive (Llinás et al., 1974; Sotelo et al., 1974), and the Mauthner cells of the goldfish (Nakajima, 1974); and in the spinal cord, the bulbocavernosus (Matsumoto et al., 1988) and Rexed’s laminar (Rash et al., 1996) nuclei. With the obvious exception of the Mauthner cells, interneuronal coupling in all of these areas has been found in mammals. Furthermore, it seems that in order to find such coupling in any given brain area, one must simply make a serious search for it. This list will grow. Persisting in the ostrich-like behavior of ignoring these electrical and/or

metabolic interactions among neurons, and failing to integrate them into our models of how the brain works, is counterproductive for students of brain function.

# METHODS USED TO DEMONSTRATE COUPLING

Among these already identified regions, the evidence for coupling varies in type and extent, with the data for any given area coming from one or more of the main methods used to investigate this phenomenon: (1) dual electrophysiological recordings from coupled cells; (2) electrophysiological measures of changes in cell input resistance or capacitance; (3) dye coupling (the transfer of low molecular weight dyes from one intracellularly injected neuron to one or more others); (4) electron microscopy; (5) *in situ* hybridization for mRNAs encoding the connexin proteins that are thought to form gap junction hemichannels; and (6) immunocytochemistry to more directly demonstrate the cellular expression of those proteins.

Two further methods have been used to determine coupling among cultured cells: scrape loading (*El-Fouly et al.*, 1987) and calcium imaging (*Grynkiewicz et al.*, 1985). In scrape loading experiments, two dyes, one of high and one of low molecular weight, are placed in the culture medium, and the culture is scraped with a stylus to damage a line of cells. These cells take up both dyes and quickly reseal their damaged membranes. Unable to pass through gap junctions, the large dye molecules (e.g., rhodamine-dextran) are trapped in the line of cells adjacent to the scrape, while the smaller dye (e.g., lucifer yellow, LY) diffuses through the gap junctions into the neighboring cells. Imaging with calcium-sensitive, fluorescent dyes (e.g., Fura-2) has now been used successfully to observe waves of increased cytosolic calcium that travel intracellularly from one coupled cell to another in cell or slice cultures (*Charles et al.*, 1996). It is likely that these waves are the result of IP₃ transfer from cell to cell, thereby releasing calcium from internal stores in each cell in the chain (see *Charles*, 1998 for review). Prevention of the dye transfer or the calcium wave from occurring by a variety of gap junction uncouplers, has given credence to these methods of measuring gap junction communication.

## Brief critique of methods

Each of the six main methods used to measure junctional communication in brain brings with it advantages and shortcomings, in some cases relating to the ease or difficulty of application and in others, the uniqueness and clarity of interpretation. For instance, simultaneous intracellular or patch clamp recordings from two or more coupled cells gives a direct assessment of electrotonic coupling and can provide some idea of the coupling strength that exists at the moment of recording. No notion of how many cells are coupled to each recorded cell is given by this method, however, and this is a crucial variable because the incidence of coupling is related to its importance as a factor in the functioning of networks. Moreover, changes in coupling incidence can serve as an index of modulation. That multiple cell recording data are not more generally available for neural tissue attests to the technical difficulties involved in successfully applying this technique. When cells become coupled through low resistance gap junctions, input resistance decreases due to added current pathways, and capacitance increases due to added membrane. Coupling assessed by observing changes in input resistance or capacitance have the advantage that they require recording from only one cell at a time, but the results obtained are not always clearly interpretable as changes in coupling since other factors, such as opening or closing of membrane channels, changes in electrode properties during recording, endo- or exocytic events that may affect the amount of membrane entering into capacitance measurements can also influence these measures. As with dual recordings, this method yields no direct indication of the number of coupled cells.

For determining the incidence of coupling among brain cells, one of the most popular methods is dye coupling. Clear advantages of this technique are that only one cell has to be recorded and injected; it can be done in intact brain tissue, in brain slices or in culture; some indication of the number of cells electrically or metabolically coupled to the injected cell emerges; the morphologies of the injected and coupled cells as well as their mode of coupling (e.g., dendrodendritic, somatic, etc.) can be determined; and, for some cells at least, subsequent immunocytochemical analyses can provide information regarding their expression of synthetic enzymes and other intracellular proteins that may be of interest (e.g., calcium binding proteins or releasable peptides). That the strength of coupling can not be directly assessed, that the choice of dyes may lead to false negatives or underestimations of coupling incidence, and that there is a possibility of false positives, especially in estimating somasomatic coupling, are all shortcomings of this method.

Once, electron microscopy was the only way to investigate the existence of gap junctions. Ultrastructural demonstrations of membranes in the typical gap junction configuration are the *sine qua non* for indicating the presence of gap junctions between cells, in the sense that positive identification by this method has consistently been associated with functional coupling. Unfortunately, the lack of ultrastructural evidence for gap junctions does not, as has been so frequently assumed, constitute evidence of a lack of junctional communication. (For discussions see Hatton, 1990; Dermietzel and Spray, 1993; De Zeeuw et al., 1995.) While this method remains extremely useful, especially in combination with immunocytochemistry for connexin proteins, conventional electron microscopy has poorly estimated the existence of neuronal coupling, as it only detects relatively large, condensed-plaque gap junctions. These are characteristic of the astrocyte syncytium, but appear not to be the typical structure supporting interneuronal coupling. Smaller numbers of somewhat dispersed membrane particles that may, in fact, be connexin proteins are detectable ultrastructurally with freeze-fracture methods, but are not easily identifiable as gap junction hemichannels with this technique. Thus, purely electron microscopic investigations have revealed only a small subset of those gap junctions that mediate coupling in neuronal networks. Being a structural method, electron microscopy also provides no information regarding the physiological characteristics of the gap junction channels.

Both *in situ* hybridization for connexin mRNAs and immunocytochemistry for connexin proteins have the advantage that they are sensitive detectors of a cell's potential for forming gap junctions. As such, they have provided new insights into the distributions and extent of nervous system elements that may, and probably do, form coupled networks. In some cases, these methods have confirmed that the coupling already demonstrated by physiological means is, indeed, mediated by gap junctions and, in other cases, the physiological methods have been used to show that cells found to express connexins tend to be coupled. There are enough exceptions to this association, however, to remind us that structural data remain limited indicators of function.

### MODULATION OF COUPLING

#### Time domains

Modulation of intercellular coupling occurs in more than one time domain. On a relatively slow scale of hours is regulation of the genes coding for the connexins and synthesis of the protein itself. Transport of the protein, its insertion into the membrane and docking with a hemichannel of another cell could be viewed as occurring on a somewhat faster scale of minutes to a few hours. Chemical synaptic inputs are likely to play roles in some or all of these slower processes, as they do in similar events associated with membranes, but little is presently known about these roles in gap junction expression. Most of what is known about synaptic modulation relates to more rapidly occurring events. Factors in this time domain (seconds to minutes) having the potential to modulate junctional communication include changes in intracellular Ca²⁺ concentration, pH, cyclic nucleotides and enzymes that participate in protein phosphorylation or dephosphorylation, and molecules such as steroids and eicosanoids that influence membrane fluidity. Chemical synaptic modulation of ionic membrane conductances that result in changes in transjunctional voltage and/or electrotonic spread through gap junctions, has the most rapidly occurring (milliseconds to seconds), and perhaps also the most transient, influences on interneuronal coupling.

#### Influences of transmitters and synaptic inputs

Despite the considerable length of time that has elapsed since the discovery of interneuronal coupling in the mammalian brain, convincing demonstrations that synaptic inputs can influence this type of cell-cell interaction have come only recently. For only a subset of those brain areas for which the data indicate the presence of coupling is there evidence for synaptic influences on its strength, incidence or extent. These are summarized in Table 1.

#### Inferior olive

One of these brain regions is the inferior olivary complex, consisting of neurons whose axons provide the climbing fiber inputs to the cerebellar Purkinje cell dendritic trees, and whose dendrites receive GABAergic afferents from the deep cerebellar nuclei. Since these deep nuclei are the recipients of the Purkinje cell output, a feedback circuit is thereby formed. The pioneering studies of Llinás and colleagues (Llinás et al., 1974; Sotelo et al., 1974) showed, by electron microscopy, that the dendrites of inferior olivary neurons formed large gap junctions with those of other olivary neurons which, it has now been revealed, can either be close neighbors or could be

Recent work (Lang *et al.*, 1996) has not only confirmed this role of synaptic input in modulating coupling and the synchronous firing activity of olivary neurons, but has done so by activating a known pathway from the dentate nucleus to the olivary complex. Electrical stimulation of this GABAergic input uncoupled the olivary neurons and disrupted the synchronous ‘complex spikes’ that are characteristic of these neurons. Either bicuculline or the Cl⁻ channel blocker, picrotoxin, could block this disruption, suggesting mediation by GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors. Additionally, acute removal of this GABAergic influence by excitotoxic lesioning of the dentate nucleus, resulted in increased synchrony among olivary neurons. Lang *et al.* suggested that the inhibitory decoupling of these olivary neurons may serve as a superimposed pattern generator on this motor time keeper. Since GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors reduce input resistance by opening Cl⁻ channels, the mechanism of transient uncoupling should be similar to that described above for excitatory synaptic modulation, that is, an increased transmembrane conductance resulting in a reduced electrotonic spread.

It has been reported recently that chronic depletion of GABAergic inputs to the olivary neurons, by lesioning cerebellar nuclei, results in a reduction in gap junction frequency (De Zeeuw *et al.*, 1997) and in the dendritic lamellar bodies that are hypothesized to participate in their synthesis (De Zeeuw *et al.*, 1995). Complex spike synchrony also declined in lesioned animals. These results suggest that the inputs to the olivary neurons that were removed by the lesions normally have a trophic influence on gap junction protein expression, and that this influence is in addition to their capacity to release GABA. Further research in this area is eagerly awaited.

By contrast, of the neurons injected on the side ipsilateral to the lesion, 38% were coupled to at least one other neuron with similar morphological features. A hypothesis based on these results is that the normal dopaminergic synaptic input to the medium spiny neurons, the main projection neurons of the striatum, serves to uncouple these cells, and that reduction in dopamine facilitates junctional communication in this network.

Work of Grace and colleagues has provided support for the hypothesis that dopamine has modulatory effects on interneuronal coupling in the striatum and nucleus accumbens, a portion of which is related to the ventral striatum (O'Donnell and Grace, 1993; Onn and Grace, 1994, 1995). The picture that has emerged from these studies, however, is not a simple one. Dopamine’s effect on coupling appears to depend on the cell type or region investigated but, more importantly, on the receptor subtype activated by this transmitter. Onn and Grace (1994) confirmed that coupling among medium spiny striatal neurons also occurs *in vivo*, and that systemically administered dopamine agonists, given in behaviorally effective doses, profoundly influence dye coupling. D<sub>1</sub> receptor agonists or antagonists had little effect on the relatively low incidence of coupling typically seen in untreated animals, whereas either the mixed dopamine agonist, apomorphine, or the D<sub>2</sub> agonist, quinpirole, increased the incidence by ~four to five-fold. In addition, D<sub>2</sub> receptor stimulation appeared to induce coupling to form a numerically larger network of neurons, and uniquely resulted in coupled clusters of neurons crossing the patch/matrix boundaries, a feature not seen under normal circumstances. From this type of study, the site of action of the systemically administered dopamine is not discernible, and thus the apparent discrepancy with the results of Cepeda *et al.* (1989) cannot be resolved. If these effects of dopamine agonists were, indeed, due to their direct action in the striatum, it is still not completely clear whether presynaptic or postsynaptic (or both) sites are involved. The apparent lack of effect of D<sub>1</sub> agonists does, however, suggest that the increased coupling with D<sub>2</sub> agonists was not due to presynaptic D<sub>2</sub> inhibition of postsynaptic D<sub>1</sub> receptor-mediated effects. See Figure 1 for a diagrammatic comparison of dopaminergic D<sub>1</sub> and D<sub>2</sub> effects on coupling.

Prolonged (1 month, but not 2 weeks) treatment with haloperidol, a dopamine receptor antagonist, also resulted in increased dye coupling among striatal matrix neurons as well as among neurons in both the ventral striatum-related ‘core’ and the limbic-related ‘shell’ regions of the nucleus

ing it in another, depending upon the relative densities of D₁ vs D₂ receptors on each neuronal type or at any given time (see Fig. 1).

If the main action of nigral dopamine released on to striatal medium spiny neurons is to uncouple this network, then it appears that such action can be countered by neocortical afferent input to the striatum. O'Donnell and Grace (1997) reported that brief trains of electrical stimulation delivered to corticostriatal afferents in slices resulted in dramatically increased LY dye coupling among striatal neurons. With such stimulation, over 50% of injected neurons were coupled (up from 0% in control slices), an effect which was mimicked in magnitude by acute administration of the NO donor, nitroprusside. Stimulation-induced increased coupling incidence was abolished by the NO synthase inhibitor, L-NAME, but not by the inactive compound, D-NAME. Since NO synthase in the striatum is predominantly found in interneurons, it appears that NO-mediated cortical afferent modulation of coupling among medium spiny neurons is via this pathway. It is possible that the increased junctional communication involved activation of soluble guanylyl cyclase, the NO receptor, and cGMP-dependent mechanisms, as has been shown in hypothalamic neurons (see below and Fig. 2).

That there are different synaptic inputs whose action is either to couple or to uncouple striatal neurons implies a regulatory balance in the system and some function-related need for the neurons, at least transiently, to be in one of these states or the other. One could speculate that the coupling is bistable, remaining in one state until it is kicked (or nudged) into the other. What functions are served by these states remains to be determined.

Islands of Calleja. In an area related to the striatum and perhaps also to the ventral pallidum, the granule cells of the Islands of Calleja form tightly packed masses that are prominent in Nissl-stained material from the olfactory tubercle. Specialized somasomatic appositions resemble group junctions were first reported by Ribak and Fallon (1982). Electrophysiological investigations into their possible function had to await the development of appropriate techniques, due in part to the tiny size of these cells (diameters of ~5–8 μm). Patch clamp methods have recently been used to study electrotonic coupling between these granule cells in thin slices and dissociated cell clumps (Halliwell and Horne, 1998). By several criteria, these cells are electrically coupled in the slice, as they exhibit fast prepotentials, stepwise shifts in whole cell conduct-

measured. Dopamine was found to increase coupling among these granule cells, often producing up to 30-fold conductance increases. This transmitter effect was apparently mediated by activation of D<sub>3</sub> receptors, as agonists with increasing affinity for this receptor induced the changes, and D<sub>1</sub> receptor agonists or antagonists were ineffective. Conductances were also increased by upward shifts in pH and decreased by an uncoupling agent. The functional significance of either the coupled networks of granule cells or their synaptic modulation is not yet known.

Neocortex. Complicated is the apropos descriptor for the story of neuronal coupling in the neocortex. In part, this is due to there being a fair amount of generally unappreciated heterogeneity across regions, and across layers within regions, of the neocortex, making comparisons tenuous. Also, there is a superabundance of dye coupling prenatally (Lo Turco and Kriegstein, 1991; Peinado et al., 1994), which is still appreciable after birth and declines precipitously to practically nil by the end of the second postnatal week (see Rörig and Sutor, 1996b). This switch from abundantly to infrequently observed coupling is nearly cotemporal with a postnatal decline in neuronal expression of connexin26 and a compensatory increase in expression of connexin32 (Nadarajah et al., 1997). By both immunocytochemical (Nadarajah et al., 1996) and freeze-fracture criteria (Bozhilova-Pastirova and Ovtscharoff, 1995), neuronal gap junctions are plentiful in the adult rat neocortex. It is also the case that coupling among neocortical neurons was initially seen in adult visual neocortex (Gutnick and Prince, 1981) which, interestingly enough, is one of the areas in which connexin32 is relatively highly expressed (Nadarajah et al., 1996). Since gap junctions are the structures that mediate coupling, the challenging question has been, why is dye coupling so easy to demonstrate in the embryonic or neonatal neocortex, and not in the adult? Many factors may participate in the full answer to this question, including one most relevant to the topic of this review: synaptic modulation.

A series of studies of coupling in the developing neocortex has recently been published by Rörig and colleagues, in which variables related to synaptic events were investigated. Coupling, as indicated by intercellular transfer of the tracer, Neurobiotin, was found to be extensive in layer II/III of control slices of frontal and prefrontal cortex: clusters of ~30 pyramidal neurons were often coupled to one injected cell. Bath-applied dopamine, acting via D<sub>1</sub> and D<sub>2</sub> receptors, uncoupled these cells (e.g.

dopamine increased input resistance and reduced neurobiotin transfer), as did applications of either the adenylyl cyclase activator, forskolin, or the protein kinase A activator, Sp-cAMPS. In layer IV/V where coupling was modest in the controls, dopamine had no effect on the variables measured ([Rörig *et al.*, 1995a](https://doi.org/10.1006/cbii.1995.1024)). In a similar study ([Rörig and Sutor, 1996c](https://doi.org/10.1006/cbii.1996.0037)), bath-applied serotonin, acting via 5-HT₂ receptors, was shown to uncouple pyramidal neurons in layer II/III of the parietal cortex. This uncoupling effect was found to be suppressed by inhibitors of protein kinase C, but not the A kinase, and by the IP₃ receptor blocker, heparin. Coupling among immature pyramidal neurons of the prefrontal and somatic sensory cortex was also shown to be reversibly reduced, as measured by input resistance changes, when the intracellular pH was lowered (~0.4 pH units) by bath-application of weak organic acids ([Rörig *et al.*, 1996](https://doi.org/10.1006/cbii.1996.0038)). Although stimulation electrodes were placed in the layer VI/white matter border in this study, thereby presenting an opportunity to directly investigate the effects of synaptic activation on coupling, this opportunity was not exploited. NO was also reported by these workers to uncouple neocortical neurons by stimulating production of cGMP, an effect that was mimicked by bath-application of the membrane permeant 8-bromo-cGMP and blocked by guanylyl cyclase inhibition ([Rörig and Sutor, 1996a](https://doi.org/10.1006/cbii.1996.0036)). Finally, β-adrenergic stimulation, which activated adenylyl cyclase, also reduced dye coupling among developing neocortical neurons ([Rörig *et al.*, 1995b](https://doi.org/10.1006/cbii.1995.1023)).

It could scarcely be clearer from the results thus far reported in the literature that any type of stimulation at all appears to uncouple the majority of immature neocortical neurons. Perhaps the superabundance of coupling among these neurons provides a clue to this one-way regulation. It appears that the normal functional state of these junctions is to be open, or at least the gap junctions mediating this coupling have a high frequency and/or long duration of open times, as opposed to just more gap junction channels during development. This hypothesis is supported by the finding that there does not seem to be a greater expression of connexin26 in the immature neocortical neurons than there is of connexin32 in those of the young adult ([Nadarajah *et al.*, 1996](https://doi.org/10.1006/cbii.1996.0039)). If this hypothesis is correct, then the gap junction channels would return to this predominantly open state following any perturbation that tended to close them and uncouple the network. Therefore, only uncoupling mechanisms are required for regulation. Since there are demonstrable gap junctions in the mature neo-

cortex and coupling, albeit so far not found to be in great abundance, can also be demonstrated there, perhaps the gap junctions mediating the coupling among mature neocortical neurons simply have characteristically closed states. As pointed out above, around weaning age there is a switch in neocortical connexin expression, from predominantly expressing connexin26 in neurons to expressing connexin32 ([Nadarajah *et al.*, 1996](https://doi.org/10.1006/cbii.1996.0039)), a factor that may profoundly change not only the normal functional state of the gap junction channels, but also the regulatory mechanisms to which they are subject. Another difference between the immature and mature neocortex that must play a role in the coupling and uncoupling of these networks is that the mature cortex, by definition, has a full complement of synaptic connections. One obvious inference here is that stimulation of the appropriate types of synapses should be capable of inducing or increasing coupling among the mature neurons. To this reviewer’s knowledge, the experiments that might shed light on this hypothesis have not been reported. Consideration of the factors reviewed above suggests that coupling exists and is important at both of these developmental times, but has vastly disparate functional significance in the developing and the mature brain.

Retina. Like immature neocortical neurons, cells in the retinas of a variety of animals are characterized by high degrees of interneuronal coupling (for review, see [Vaney, 1994](https://doi.org/10.1006/exnr.1994.1028)). For example, Neurobiotin injection into one AII amacrine cell in cat or rabbit retina may diffuse into nearly 200 surrounding AII cells ([Vaney, 1991](https://doi.org/10.1016/0306-4522(91)90355-W)). Similarly, most types of horizontal cells show extensive coupling among themselves. One difference in the retina is that cells, such as AII amacrine cells, also show heterologous coupling with bipolar cells. Like the developing cortical neurons, retinal cells tend to be uncoupled by most synaptically related factors. As in other systems discussed above, dopamine’s action in the retina is generally to uncouple the network via its activation of adenylyl cyclase. This has been shown in rabbit retinal amacrine cells with exogenous dopamine, and where release of endogenous transmitters was also evoked by veratradine ([Hampson *et al.*, 1992](https://doi.org/10.1016/0306-4522(92)90448-8)). In both cases, D₁ antagonists blocked the uncoupling effects.

Similar uncoupling by dopamine or by direct intracellular injection of cAMP have been reported for horizontal cells of zebrafish ([McMahon and Brown, 1994](https://doi.org/10.1016/0306-4522(94)90380-6)), carp and turtle ([Miyachi and Murakami, 1989](https://doi.org/10.1016/0306-4522(89)90355-6)) and mudpuppy ([Dong and McReynolds, 1991](https://doi.org/10.1016/0306-4522(91)90355-W)). In this last study, however, it

was shown that, while dopamine or D₁ receptor agonists decreased electrical coupling, D₂ receptor agonists or D₁ antagonists increased it. Chemically blocking the response to light of on-center bipolar cells also increased horizontal cell coupling, probably by causing a decrease in synaptically released dopamine. This seems to imply that retinal circuitry, at least that part of it influenced by gap junction conductances, changes in response to the patterns of light reaching the photoreceptors.

In rabbit retinal horizontal cells, the ability of dopamine to uncouple the network is pH-dependent. Lowering pH has been found to reduce coupling among most cell types, not only neurons, and so it is with these horizontal cells, which are highly coupled at pH 7.2–7.4, but not at pH 7.0. Remarkably, Hampson *et al.* (1994) found that dopamine, at concentrations as high as 500 μM was unable to reduce LY coupling of these cells at pH 7.4, although an order of magnitude lower concentration was effective in uncoupling them at pH 7.2. It is not unlikely that such dependency on pH exists in other systems where dopamine has been found to uncouple neurons, and perhaps for other transmitters as well.

It is fascinating that the gap junctions that AII amacrine cells form with each other and those that they form with bipolar cells are differentially permeable to dye-tracer transfer and are differentially modulated (Mills and Massey, 1995). Dopamine and cAMP agonists reduced Neurobiotin coupling via the more permeant AII–AII gap junctions, but not AII coupling with bipolar cells through the less permeable gap junctions. The latter coupling was selectively reduced by NO donors and cGMP analogs. Similar uncoupling effects on turtle and carp horizontal cells have been reported to follow administration of cGMP by direct intracellular injection (Miyachi and Murakami, 1991), by the NO precursor, L-arginine (Miyachi and Nishikawa, 1994) or by arachidonic acid acting via a cGMP pathway (Miyachi *et al.*, 1994). The retina continues to serve as a model system for the study of interneuronal coupling, but does not seem to be ideal for investigating synaptic modulation, since selective activation of synaptic inputs to retina seems to have been an unsumounted challenge to date.

Hypothalamus. Two hypothalamic nuclei, the paraventricular (PVN) and supraoptic (SON) nuclei, are part of a system, the hypothalamo-neurohypophysial system, that has become a model for the study of morphological and functional plasticity in the mammalian CNS (for reviews see

Hatton, 1990, 1997). Individual magnocellular neuroendocrine cells of these nuclei synthesize one of two neuropeptide hormones, either oxytocin or vasopressin, which are released from their axon terminals in the neurohypophysis. A wealth of information has accumulated over several decades of investigation into the physiological conditions that activate this system (e.g. during dehydration, blood pressure control, parturition, lactation) and the effects of these neuropeptides on peripheral tissues (e.g. antidiuresis, natriuresis, vasoconstriction, uterine contraction, milk ejection). Although the first demonstration of coupling among these neurons involved both nuclei (Andrew *et al.*, 1981), and many of the early studies focused on the PVN, it soon became apparent, for several reasons, that the SON would be the nucleus of choice for in-depth investigation of both coupling and its modulation. For present purposes, the more important among these reasons are, first, that the SON contains only the two peptidergic cell types, while in the PVN there are many, thereby adding complication to the experiments and to the interpretations of results. Second, the SON can be studied in horizontally cut hypothalamic slices or explants that preserve the integrity of the dendritic arbors of these neurons, a crucial factor since the coupling between oxytocin and between vasopressin neurons is entirely dendrodendritic. Third and, most importantly, when properly done, the horizontal cuts preserve afferent pathways that can be selectively stimulated in these preparations.

Physiological states associated with increased synthesis and release of oxytocin and/or vasopressin, such as, dehydration or lactation, consistently elevate the incidence of dye coupling (Cobbett and Hatton, 1984; Hatton *et al.*, 1987; Yang and Hatton, 1987). Presuming that physiological activation of this system is in large part via synaptic mechanisms suggested that coupling among these peptidergic neurons would ultimately be found to be synaptically modulated. It was clear from the earlier studies, however, that gonadal steroid hormones, which are not directly traceable to synaptic events, also had the capacity to up- and down-regulate coupling between these magnocellular neurons (Cobbett *et al.*, 1987; Hatton *et al.*, 1992). Additionally, changes in the expression of mRNA for connexin32, but not connexin43, and dye coupling among putative oxytocin neurons in the SON, occur at functionally meaningful junctures accompanying the events of late pregnancy, parturition and lactation (Micevych *et al.*, 1996; Kumamoto *et al.*, 1997).

Direct modulation of interneuronal coupling among SON neurons has been demonstrated for two independent afferent inputs. Axons of mitral cells from the main and accessory olfactory bulbs constitute one of these pathways, projecting to the SON dendritic zone (Smithson *et al.*, 1989, 1992). Activation of these synapses by lateral olfactory tract stimulation is capable of monosynaptically activating non-NMDA and NMDA receptors on oxytocin and vasopressin neurons (Hatton and Yang, 1989; Yang *et al.*, 1995). After extracellular electrical stimulation of the lateral olfactory tract for 10 min at 10 Hz, there was a selective increase of more than 70% in the incidence of LY dye coupling among SON neurons in slices taken from lactating rats (Hatton and Yang, 1990). Similar stimulation in slices taken from virgin female or male rats failed to influence the frequency of dye coupling. This selectivity may be due in part to the increased expression of connexin32 during lactation, and perhaps also to an upregulation of glutamate receptors which has been shown to occur when this system is activated by chronic physiological stimulation (Meeker *et al.*, 1994), as it certainly was during lactation. It is unlikely that the coupling increase was due to new synthesis of connexin32 protein and subsequent increases in the number of gap junction channels during the stimulation, however, as the time of stimulation was probably too brief for those events to take place. Since both NMDA and non-NMDA receptors are activated by this stimulus protocol, it is likely that the coupling increase was due to gap junction channel gating by a cascade of intracellular events that started with increased cytosolic free Ca²⁺, and was mediated by cGMP-dependent pathways (see below). It also seems likely that one of the intermediaries in this process leading to increased accumulation of cGMP might be Ca²⁺-calmodulin-stimulated NO synthase and the production of NO (see Fig. 2), as this has now been found to increase coupling among these neurons (Yang and Hatton, 1997). Of special interest here is the usually unappreciated, unusual circumstance that these peptidergic neurons in the SON contain both the machinery for NO production (Bredt *et al.*, 1990) and an abundance of both the α1 and β1 subunits of soluble guanylyl cyclase, the NO receptor (Furuyama *et al.*, 1993).

More direct evidence for cyclic nucleotide involvement in synaptic modulation of coupling among these neurons comes from stimulation of another afferent pathway to the SON. Axons emanating from the histaminergic neurons of the posterior hypothalamic tuberomammillary nucleus distribute to virtually all brain areas (Wada *et al.*, 1991). Fortunately, this nucleus and its direct projections to the SON are maintained intact in our horizontal slice preparations. Electrical stimulation of this nucleus results in excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) and EPSPs leading to action potentials, and to a prolonged increase in excitability, in SON vasopressin neurons (Hatton and Yang, 1996; Yang and Hatton, 1989, 1994). The prolonged depolarization, first reported by Armstrong and Sladek (1985), is due to H₁ histamine receptor activation of a G-protein-mediated suppression of K⁺ leakage current (Li and Hatton, 1996). In oxytocin neurons, by contrast, stimulation of this pathway results in Cl⁻-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) (Yang and Hatton, 1994).

In our recent study of synaptic modulation of coupling (Hatton and Yang, 1996), LY dye coupling incidence was selectively assessed for the vasopressin neuronal subpopulation after stimulation of the tuberomammillary nucleus. The EPSPs and spikes evoked by this excitatory input could be blocked by H₁ histamine antagonists (e.g. pyrilamine), suggesting that these compounds block both the metabotropic H₁ receptor, which is linked to guanylyl cyclase and the, as yet uncharacterized, ionotropic receptor which may open Na⁺ channels. Stimulation for 10 min at 10 Hz resulted in a three-fold increase in coupling. This increase was manifested by both increased numbers of dye-filled cells and by increases in the numbers of cells coupled to the injected neurons, that is an expansion of the coupled network. H₁ receptor antagonists, but not H₂ or glutamate receptor antagonists, blocked both the synaptic responses and the increase in coupling. Inhibition of guanylyl cyclase, however, abolished the stimulation-induced coupling without interfering with the synaptic responses. Furthermore, bath-application of the membrane permeant cGMP analog, 8-bromo-cGMP, mimicked the coupling increase induced by stimulation. Conversely, 8-bromo-cAMP reduced dye coupling below the levels observed in untreated control slices. See Figure 2 for a diagrammatic presentation of the mechanisms involved.

Thus, it appears that the coupled network, of vasopressin neurons at least, can be expanded by synaptically released transmitter/modulators that activate guanylyl cyclase (either the soluble or particulate isoforms) or that are negatively coupled to adenyl cyclase. Uncoupling would result from those synaptically released agents that stimulate the production and accumulation of cAMP. Mechanisms by which cyclic nucleotides and their

associated kinases might influence gap junction channel gating are not known, but probably involve phosphorylation and/or dephosphorylation of integral membrane proteins, including the regulatory sites on the connexins themselves. In this regard, cyclic nucleotide-dependent phosphorylation of connexin32 and increased junctional conductance between liver cells have a similar time course (Sáez *et al.*, 1990), but comparable data for neurons in the brain are not currently available.

What functional roles in this system might be played, not only by interneuronal coupling but also by its synaptic modulation? Clearly, as with all of the other neuronal systems reviewed above, opening of gap junction channels permits intercellular transfer of small molecules (e.g. nucleotides, phosphoinositides, etc.) as well as ions, the chief current carrier being K⁺. Such metabolic cooperation among cells of a peptidergic system could serve to equilibrate synthetic processing, especially during times of increased demand for peptide release (e.g. during dehydration or lactation), for it is under these and similar circumstances that the incidence of coupling is consistently observed to be high. Possible electrophysiological consequences of coupling are more complex to analyze. The simplistic view of gap junction communication among excitable cells, now only entertained by the uninitiated, is that coupling always implies synchrony among the coupled cells. Strong coupling, mediated by large gap junctions, can indeed synchronize the activity of coupled neurons, as seen in the inferior olive. Weaker coupling can also synchronize if conditions are right, as reported in the locus coeruleus (Travagli *et al.*, 1995), by controlling subthreshold activity. Modelling studies, in which junctional conductances were varied, have made it clear that coupling can also function to yield a network that is synchronized (cells fire slightly out of phase) or desynchronized (one cell fires only when the other is silent), and continuous variations between these two (Sherman and Rinzel, 1992).

Among the oxytocin neurons of the SON, LY coupling is extremely infrequent in the virgin female rat and most extensive in the lactating, actively nursing mother. At somewhat regular intervals during suckling by the pups, ~4000–5000 oxytocin neurons interrupt their continuous background activity to fire brief, relatively synchronized, high frequency bursts. This provides the ~0.5-mU bolus of oxytocin in the blood that is required to produce a milk ejection reflex, and make the pups happy. All of these cells’ bursts occur within a ~500-ms time period, providing an intriguing functional correlate of coupling (see

Hatton, 1990). That coupling among these neurons can be further enhanced by brief activation of olfactory afferents, may also have a functional correlate in the strong olfactory and vomeronasal stimulation often experienced by the dam during the perisuckling interval. This is a time when she engages in such maternal behaviors as anogenital licking of the pups, an activity that may ready the SON oxytocin cells for the synchronous bursts that are to come.

Vasopressin neurons have not been convincingly shown to fire synchronously under any physiological conditions. Indeed, these neurons may be candidates for the kind of weak coupling that supports desynchronized activity. Physiological activation of vasopressin neurons, unlike oxytocin cells, results in the generation of an activity pattern called ‘phasic bursting’, a pattern that has been shown to maximize vasopressin release from terminals (see Hatton, 1990 for references). In this pattern, the cell undergoes a slow depolarization, fires one or two action potentials that are followed by depolarizing after-potentials of sufficient magnitude (~3–5 mV) to trigger a plateau potential and a burst of spikes lasting many seconds to minutes. After each such burst, the cell falls silent for a time period roughly equal to the burst duration. Our recent work suggests that SON cells that engage in this pattern of activity are almost always dye coupled to one or more others. Uncoupling agents, such as weak acid or heptanol, eliminate the slow depolarizations and the phasic bursting (Li, Kumamoto and Hatton, unpublished observations). On those rare occasions when two phasically firing cells have been recorded simultaneously *in vivo* (Leng and Dyball, 1983), their bursts have been out of phase. Physiologically, this type of time-sharing or alternating activity would produce the continuous, steady titres of vasopressin in the blood that are characteristic of water regulatory responses, for example, and seem to be necessary for efficient, continuous reabsorption of water by the kidney. That synaptic release of histamine into the SON enhances coupling (Hatton and Yang, 1996), depolarizing after-potentials and phasic bursting activity (Li and Hatton, 1996; Smith and Armstrong, 1993), correlates well with its capacity to enhance vasopressin release *in vivo* (see Weiss *et al.*, 1989 for references). Uncoupling this network leaves the vasopressin neurons firing slowly and irregularly, activity that is associated with only basal levels of vasopressin release. Thus, it appears that coupling among these SON neurons, as well as synaptic modulation of the coupled network, are integral to proper functioning of this system.

Goldfish Mauthner cells. Sensory afferents from the goldfish sacculus project via the posterior VIIIth nerve to make large (10–15 μm diameter) club endings contacting the lateral dendrite of the Mauthner cell. These endings form mixed synapses with the lateral dendrite, consisting of a glutamatergic chemical synapse and a gap junction mediating electrotonic conduction. In a series of studies, Faber and colleagues have demonstrated that junctional conductances at these mixed synapses can be modulated by the chemical synaptic inputs. Suprathreshold tetanizing stimulation of this VIIIth nerve afferent fiber was first found to lead to prolonged potentiation, of up to 70 min (the longest time measured), of both the electrotonic and the chemical synaptic response ([Yang et al., 1990](https://doi.org/10.1016/0304-3940(90)90285-W)). NMDA receptor antagonists completely and reversibly blocked potentiation of both responses. Calcium dependence was also demonstrated, as potentiation of the responses was abolished by injection of the calcium chelator, BAPTA, into the Mauthner cell dendrite. Further work showed that the junctional conductances at these mixed synapses, as well as the potentiation of the chemical component were positively influenced by dopamine acting at postsynaptic D₁ receptors. These responses were mediated by cAMP-dependent mechanisms ([Pereda et al., 1992](https://doi.org/10.1016/0304-3940(92)90586-8)). Recently, this system has been exploited to demonstrate that synaptic influences on electrotonic coupling can also be transient in duration, depending upon the pattern of synaptic input ([Pereda and Faber, 1996](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0304-3940(96)00366-8)). Thus, a discontinuous pattern of input produced by interrupted brief stimuli, as might occur physiologically, was able to induce enhancements in both the chemical and electrotonic postsynaptic responses that decayed over periods of ~3 min. This is the first example of coupling modulation in this time frame. Such short-term plasticity may be mediated by Ca²⁺ transients, the sequelae of which have similar durations, as BAPTA injected into the lateral dendrite abolished the transient potentiation. For further discussion of electrical synapses and their function in lower vertebrates and invertebrates, the reader is encouraged to see a recent review by [Bennett (1997)](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0304-3940(97)00422-5).

**OTHER MODULATORY POSSIBILITIES**

In addition to the direct synaptic signals that may modulate the incidence, extent and/or strength of interneuronal coupling, there are more subtle, indirect factors with potential influence. One such factor involves the astrocytic glial cells that gener-

ally occupy the spaces between neurons and engulf synapses. Neuronal activity, particularly intense activity, results in increases in extracellular K⁺ which is taken up by the local astrocytes. Spatial buffering of K⁺ by these glia is now a well known story. K⁺ uptake, however, also depolarizes the glial cells, triggering an electrogenic inward Na⁺/HCO₃⁻ cotransport which causes an alkaline shift in the glia and a resultant acidification of the extracellular fluid (see [Deitmer, 1998](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0304-3940(98)00112-5) for review). Since positive shifts in pH increase junctional conductances, this glial alkalinization facilitates spatial buffering through the syncytium. The consequent lowering of neuronal pH, however, would tend to uncouple the network or perhaps, as reported in studies of the retina ([Hampson et al., 1994](https://doi.org/10.1016/0304-3940(94)90586-8)), place the neurons in the pH range in which they would be subject to uncoupling by released dopamine.

Another subtle means by which coupling may be modulated indirectly by synaptically related factors is via clustering or dispersal of the connexons. Freeze fracture methods have shown in goldfish retinal horizontal cells, that gap junction particles in control retinas, in which intercellular communication is extensive, are loosely arranged and contain particle-free areas ([Schmitz and Wolburg, 1991](https://doi.org/10.1016/0304-3940(91)90586-8)). When the pH was lowered from 7.5 to 7.1 or below, particle density increased and the particle-free areas tended to disappear. Corresponding transmission electron microscopy showed that the gap junctions underwent a change from the typical laminar structure to one in which there were numerous electron dense submembrane patches that obscured the laminae. The effects of these pH manipulations occurred within 15 min (the only time observed) and were reversed by a return of pH to 7.5. Modelling studies of communication through dispersed vs compact gap junctions have provided evidence that dispersed junctions conduct more efficiently than compact ones by perhaps an order of magnitude ([Chen and Meng, 1995](https://doi.org/10.1016/0304-3940(95)00126-8)). In addition to pH, clustering of gap junction channels (in a cell line expressing connexin43) has been shown to be induced by forskolin activation of adenylyl cyclase and increased cAMP ([Wang and Rose, 1995](https://doi.org/10.1016/0304-3940(95)00127-7)). If this second messenger also induces connexon clustering in neurons, it would exemplify one more way in which transmitters that activate adenylyl cyclase (e.g. dopamine acting on D₁ receptors) might act as network uncouplers.

**CONCLUDING REMARKS**

Electrotonic coupling among neurons in mammalian brains is now known to be widespread, and the

Cell Biology International, Vol. 22, No. 11/12, 1998

evidence for its existence in previously unexplored brain regions is increasing. It still may be, as pointed out by Bennett (1997), that gap junctions represent a minority of the synapses in the brain. It may also be that the importance of gap junctions in brain function may relate more to their ability to influence the network properties of neural subsystems than to their absolute frequency of occurrence.

From the literature reviewed here, it is clear that electrotonic coupling is remarkably plastic in several time domains. Expression of the gene coding for connexin32, for instance, is turned on (or turned up) in SON oxytocin neurons in time for the coupled network to participate in synchronous firing that produces the milk ejection reflex. Neocortical pyramidal neurons turn off their expression of connexin26 and turn on connexin32 expression as neocortical development nears completion, a change that profoundly alters the resting network characteristics as well, perhaps, as altering which factors may now modulate the network in the adult. Plasticity on an intermediate time scale is evident from most of the studies of synaptic modulation reviewed here. Second messenger cascades, coupled to transmitter receptors, are capable of increasing or decreasing the incidence, extent and/or strength of electrotonic coupling in a network. The kinetic of these changes have not been well studied to date, but where there are good data (e.g. the Mauthner cell), the indication is that there is a dynamic range of a few minutes to many hours or more. That the coupled network can be reversibly altered on a milliseconds to seconds time scale is apparent from recent studies of the inferior olive in which brief GABAergic synaptic inputs transiently uncouple the synchronously firing olivary neurons.

It should be noted that the mechanisms responsible for the plasticity in these three time domains are different. Changes in gene expression have a major impact on coupling by influencing the number of hemichannels that will be available to form connexons with other cells in the network. Transmitters that activate second messenger cascades probably have their main effects on channel gating (i.e. opening times and probabilities), via actions on the channel proteins. It is not inconceivable, however, that these cascades could also influence gap junction turnover rates as well. Transmitters that operate on ionotropic receptors, and cause only transient effects on coupling, appear to influence electrotonic spread through the junctions by the changes that they produce in membrane conductance. Increases in membrane conductance would tend to uncouple, and decreases would tend to enhance the coupling between the junctional neurons.

Finally, it appears that there is no simple rule by which to predict what action a given neurotransmitter will have on coupling, save possibly in the immature neocortex where all agents thus far tested have uncoupling effects. Even activation of the same receptor subtype often has opposite effects on coupling in different neuronal groups. Also the same cyclic nucleotide may increase coupling in one network and decrease it in another, even though the connexin is the same in the two cases. In this, the neurons seem to be like all of the other cell systems so far investigated, in which diversity among agents and actions is the rule (Bennett et al., 1991).
