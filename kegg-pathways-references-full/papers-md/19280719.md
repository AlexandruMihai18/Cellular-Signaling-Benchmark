**ABSTRACT**

Over the two last decades, cloning of proteins responsible for trafficking and metabolic fate of long-chain fatty acids (LCFA) in gut has provided new insights on cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in fat absorption. To this systematic cloning period, functional genomics has succeeded in providing a new set of surprises. Disruption of several genes, thought to play a crucial role in LCFA absorption, did not lead to clear phenotypes. This observation raises the question of the real physiological role of lipid-binding proteins and lipid-metabolizing enzymes expressed in enterocytes. The goal of this review is to analyze present knowledge concerning the main steps of intestinal fat absorption from LCFA uptake to lipoprotein release and to assess their impact on health.

### 1. Introduction

Lipids account for about 40% of the calories ingested in Western countries, whereas nutritional recommendations are 5–10% lower. This excessive lipid intake, associated with a qualitative imbalance (excess of saturated fatty acids and cholesterol, too high \( n-6/n-3 \) ratio) strongly favours the development of obesity and associated diseases (atherosclerosis, non insulin-dependent diabetes, hypertension, cancer). From organs involved in lipid homeostasis, small intestine remains the most poorly known likely because it has been only considered for a long time as a selective barrier between outside and inside body environment.

In human diet, around 95% of dietary lipids are triacylglycerols (TAG), mainly composed of long-chain fatty acids (LCFA, number of carbons ≥ 16), the remaining being phospholipids (4.5%) and sterols. Because TAG cannot cross cellular membranes, they must be hydrolyzed before their subsequent metabolic use. Acid-stable gastric lipase partially digests TAG to form diacylglycerols and free fatty acids (FFA) in the stomach. This low lipase activity is essential for an efficient lipid emulsification [1]. Digestion of TAG continues in the small intestine mainly through the action of a colipase-dependent pancreatic lipase and leads to the release of 2-monoacylglycerols and LCFA (for a review, see [2]). In contrast to other energetic nutrients, LCFA are poorly soluble in aqueous solution. Moreover, they exhibit detergent properties potentially harmful for cellular integrity. To overcome these limitations, LCFA are successively dispersed into mixed micelles in intestinal lumen, bound to soluble lipid-binding proteins (LBP) in intestinal absorptive cells and, after re-esterification, are secreted into lymph as TAG-rich lipoproteins (Fig. 1A). During the post-prandial period, the small intestine produces and secretes chylomicrons (CM), whereas very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) are mainly synthesized during the interprandial periods. Once in the blood, TAG-rich lipoproteins are progressively hydrolyzed by the endothelial lipoprotein lipase (LPL) providing LCFA to peripheral tissues (muscles and adipose tissue). The TAG remaining in resulting small lipoproteins (remnants) are further hydrolyzed by the hepatic lipase; then remnants are cleared from blood by liver mainly via the LDL receptor-related peptide (Fig. 1A).

LCFA exert basic functions in the cell as membrane components, metabolic fuel, precursors of lipid mediators, regulators of ion-channels and modulators of gene expression [3]. They are also involved in various post-translational modifications of proteins (e.g. palmitoylation) affecting their cellular functions [4]. Therefore, digestion and absorption of dietary fat must be highly efficient to ensure a correct LCFA supply to the body. Nevertheless, LCFA being hydrophobic nutrients, their intestinal absorption remains complex. For didactic reason, it is classically depicted in three successive steps: cellular uptake, intracellular trafficking and lipoprotein synthesis/release (Fig. 1B).

### 2. Cellular LCFA uptake: diffusion and/or protein-mediated transfer?

LCFA transfer through the plasma membrane is a highly controversial question at the origin of several reviews [5–11]. By reason of their physicochemical properties, it was thought for a long time that LCFA uptake by cells only took place by diffusion. However,

this concept has been challenged over the two last decades by biochemical approaches suggesting an involvement of a protein-mediated transfer. It is likely that an efficient LCFA uptake by cells requires both spontaneous and facilitated transfer. However, the relative importance of these two mechanisms appears to be highly dependent from the microenvironment and phenotype of lipid-utilizing tissues. Thus, a direct extrapolation of a lipid-transfer model from one to another tissue may constitute physiological nonsense.

### 2.1. From the physicochemical standpoint

Simple models, as phospholipid vesicles, have been largely used to study the transbilayer movement of native or modified fatty acids *in vitro*, with or without albumin used as a donor molecule. This transfer can be viewed as three successive steps: adsorption of LCFA upon the membrane surface, “flip-flop” movement from external hemi-leaflet of bilayer to internal hemi-leaflet and desorption from internal bilayer into the inner of vesicle. By reason of their lipophilicity, LCFA adsorption is thought to be thermodynamically favourable and extremely fast [8,12]. Data on flip-flop step and, in a lesser extent, desorption are more controversial. Using the pH-sensitive fluorophore pyranin trapped into liposomes, Kamp and co-workers report a fast movement of free fatty acids (FFA) across phospholipid bilayer. A flip-flop rate shorter than 20 ms, independent of fatty acid chain length, was found. Interestingly, the transmembrane movement of anionic form of FFA was several orders of magnitude slower than that of protonated ones [13,14]. Altogether these data strongly suggest that FFA can spontaneously cross the cell surface especially when they are protonated. In this model, flip-flop is faster than desorption [13]. Conversely, other studies indicate that the flip-flop, but not the desorption step, is rate-limiting (for review see [11]). Indeed, half times found for FFA transbilayer transfer were within a 70 ms to 10 s range in function of the fatty acid type, vesicle size and temperature. It was concluded that the time course of native FFA through the phospholipid bilayer might be insufficient to support the metabolic activity in cells known to have high requirements in LCFA, as cardiomyocytes. According to these observations, a model for LCFA transfer across a phospholipid bilayer has been recently proposed [15]. Since the pKa of LCFA is lower than 5, more than 99% of LCFA are ionized at physiological pH [6]. Therefore, LCFA insert their hydrophobic carbon backbone first inside the external hemi-leaflet of membrane, the ionized carboxyl head remaining in contact with the lipid/water interface. To cross the membrane, LCFA must undergo a rotation of 180° to reorient its carboxyl group toward the aqueous phase lining the internal hemi-leaflet. In this model, LCFA rotation is a rate-limiting step since it is dependent on both formation of a free volume inside the phospholipid bilayer and LCFA folding. These steric limitations might explain why the efficiency of flip-flop appears to be tightly dependent of membrane curvature. Indeed, flip-flop half times are inversely correlated with the vesicle size, LCFA crossing small vesicles more rapidly than larger ones [15–17]. This size dependence can be accounted for by a larger free volume inside the phospholipid bilayer when the radius of curvature is small [15]. Efficiency of the flip-flop is also dependent of the LCFA itself, unsaturated fatty acids being transferred faster than saturated ones. It has been suggested that the folded conformation of unsaturated fatty acids facilitates their rotation inside to the membrane [15]. Altogether these data indicate that protonated LCFA can easily cross phospholipid bilayers.

### 2.2. From the biochemical standpoint

Liposomes are useful models to dissect FFA fluxes through phospholipid bilayers in a controlled environment. However, the simplicity of this model and the lack of subsequent LCFA metabolic use constitute major limitations of this technical approach. In isolated enterocytes, as well as in the enterocyte-like Caco-2 cell line, transport of LCFA in both apical and basolateral membranes appears to be saturable, when low LCFA concentrations are used [18,19]. A competitive inhibition by structurally related LCFA has also been reported in Caco-2 cells [20,21]. These data are consistent with an involvement a protein-facilitated process in intestinal LCFA permeation (Fig. 1B). Identification of proteins exhibiting a high affinity for LCFA in the brush border membrane (BBM) of enterocyte is in agreement with this assumption. Therefore, it has been concluded that the intestinal LCFA uptake is likely a protein-mediated event as reported for cardiac and skeletal muscles [22].

### 2.3. From the physiological standpoint

In contrast to other lipid-utilizing cells (i.e. adipocytes, myocytes and hepatocytes), intestinal absorptive cells (enterocytes) are daily subjected to dramatic changes in fat supply. Adequate luminal environment and morphological adaptations explain why the intestinal fat absorption remains efficient despite of this challenge. Firstly, the unstirred water layer lining BBM constitutes a unique microclimate which promotes the LCFA permeation (Fig. 1B). It is produced by the trapping of water molecules into a complex glycoprotein network formed by mucus and glycocalyx. With a thickness from 50 to 500 μm [23], this weak renewal compartment is characterized by a low pH gradient generated by an efficient H⁺/Na⁺ antiport exchange system located in the BBM [24,25]. By reason of their hydrophobicity, LCFA begin to cross this aqueous diffusion barrier into mixed micelles which increase 100–1000 fold their aqueous concentration [26]. Since LCFA are ionized at physiological pH in aqueous solution, the low pH microclimate found near BBM induces their massive protonation as soon as local pH becomes lower than LCFA pKa. This event is essential for an efficient fat absorption. Indeed, by reducing the LCFA solubility into mixed micelles, protonation induces the release of LCFA near the microvilli of absorptive cells [27]. Moreover, protonation facilitates their subsequent cellular uptake mainly by diffusion since protonated LCFA are known to have a greater membrane permeation capacity than their corresponding ionized species [13,28]. The fact that pharmacological inhibition of the H⁺/Na⁺ antiporter by the diuretic amiloride decreases in dose-dependent manner LCFA uptake in rat jejunal sheets is consistent with this assumption [29]. It is noteworthy that this acidic microclimate is not found in other lipid-utilizing tissues. Secondly, the presence of microvilli in the apical side of enterocytes dramatically enhances their uptake capacity. Moreover, the small membrane curvature found in the top of microvilli is favourable to a fast LCFA flip-flop in the phospholipid bilayer [15–17]. Altogether these specificities explain why intestinal LCFA uptake is not limited during a lipid load (e.g. during the post-prandial period). Therefore, extrapolation of uptake data found in the muscles, adipose tissue or liver to the small intestine is physiologically irrelevant. The same limitation also exists for intestinal cell lines or isolated enterocytes which do not fully reproduce this complex extracellular microclimate and only display a weak density of small microvilli.

In brief, passive diffusion seems to play a significant role in LCFA uptake in the small intestine. This high capacity and low affinity system appears especially well adapted to intestinal challenges since it remains efficient during the post-prandial period. Indeed, lipid fecal loss remains below 5% (w/w) even in situation of high fat supply in healthy humans, [30]. Therefore, lipid uptake does not appear to be a rate-limiting step for the intestinal fat absorption, in contrast to what it is reported for other lipid-utilizing tissues. This conclusion raises the question of the physiological
role played by the plasma membrane lipid-binding proteins found in enterocytes.

### 2.4. What functions for the plasma membrane lipid-binding proteins?

Three proteins displaying a high affinity for LCFA have been isolated in the BBM of enterocytes: the plasma membrane-associated fatty acid-binding protein (FABPpm) [31], the fatty acid transport protein 4 (FATP4) [32] and the fatty acid transporter (CD36) [33].

#### 2.4.1. FABPpm

FABPpm is a 43 kDa peripheral-associated membrane protein expressed in organs with high lipid requirements [34]. It is thought to adhere to the membrane through a specific N-terminal peptide [35]. A body of evidence supports a role of FABPpm in cellular LCFA uptake. FABPpm can bind LCFA with an apparent dissociation constant (kd) of 80 nM [36]. In vitro use of polyclonal antibodies raised against FABPpm leads to a drop in LCFA uptake in hepatocytes [37], adipocytes [38], cardiac myocytes [39] and heart giant vesicles [40]. Targeted-overexpression of FABPpm in rat soleus muscle by using electroporation of the FABPpm expression vector leads to an increase in palmitate uptake [41].

In the small intestine, FABPpm expression is found in jejunum and, in a lesser extent, in ileum. Albeit plausible, implication of FABPpm in intestinal lipid absorption remains questionable. Preincubation of jejunal explants with a mono-specific FABPpm antibody only results in a partial, but significant, inhibition of [3H]-oleate uptake [18]. Nevertheless, large amounts of antiserum were required to achieve such an inhibition. Moreover, the fact that FABPpm is also found in cryptic cells not involved in the fat absorption raises a doubt about a physiological role of this protein in the intestinal LCFA uptake [42,43]. A specific involvement in cellular LCFA transfer is also challenged because the peptic sequence of FABPpm is identical to the mitochondrial aspartate amino-transferase (mAspAT). This enzyme, found in inner mitochondrial membrane, catalyzes the reaction of transamination linking the ureogenesis pathway to the Krebs cycle [44]. Even if results obtained during (i) fasting in red skeletal muscles [45], (ii) diabetes in adipocytes from Zucker rats [46] or (iii) ethanol load in human hepatoma HepG2 cells [47] are consistent with an involvement of FABPpm/mAspAT in the FA metabolism, its precise physiological role in intestinal fat absorption remains elusive. Generation of FABPpm null mice might provide new insights on the physiological role played by this plasma membrane LBP in intestinal lipid absorption.

#### 2.4.2. FATP4

Fatty acid transport proteins (FATP) are 63 kDa proteins firstly identified in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes by expression cloning strategy on the basis of their facilitation to uptake LCFA [32]. Five and six different isoforms of FATP are found in rodents and humans, respectively [48]. Each FATP displays a specific pattern of expression [48]. For example, FATP5 and FATP2 are highly expressed in the liver [49], while FATP1 is essentially found in the adipose tissue and FATP4 in the gut [48]. Interestingly, the intestinal location of FATP4 correlated quite well with fat absorption. Indeed, its expression level is especially high in the jejunum and, to a lesser extent, in the duodenum, but is lacking in the colon [48]. Moreover, the expression of FATP4 was initially found in BBM of mature enterocytes located in the upper side of villi. In contrast, it was low or lacking in undifferentiated cryptic cells [48]. In vitro studies strongly also support an involvement of FATP4 in the LCFA uptake. Indeed, mediated-depletion of FATP4 protein by antisense strategy leads to a significant decrease in LCFA uptake in freshly isolated enterocytes [48]. Similarly, a 40% decrease in the fatty acid uptake is reported in enterocytes isolated from FATP4+/− mice which display 48% reduction of FATP4 protein [50]. Finally, FATP4 antagonists decrease LCFA uptake in cells stably transfected with a FATP4 expression vector [51]. The mechanism by which FATPs facilitate the cellular fatty acid transfer is not yet fully established. Since FATP proteins do not contain a putative LCFA-binding site, a role as fatty acid pool former upon the surface of membranes seems unlikely. In contrast, a high amino-acid sequence identity between acyl-CoA synthetases (ACS) and FATPs, as well as a comparable predictive structure including a highly conserved ATP-binding motif, strongly suggests that FATPs might be involved in fatty acid acylation with a preferential substrate specificity for LCFA and very LCFA [52,53]. The fact that membrane extracts of Cos1 cells transfected with a murine FATP4 expression vector display a high ACS activity is consistent with this assumption [54]. Such a function might be crucial. Indeed, acylation of LCFA is absolutely required for their subsequent metabolic use. Moreover, plasma membranes are impermeable to fatty acyl-CoA (FA-CoA). Therefore, it has been proposed that FATP4 contributes to uptake of LCFA by trapping them as CoA derivatives [10,53,55]. In brief, FATP4 might play an indirect role in intestinal lipid uptake through a vectorial acylation of LCFA. Nevertheless, this hypothesis has been recently challenged by the demonstration that FATP4 is rather expressed in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane than in BBM [55,56]. Moreover, the physiological impact of FATP4 on fat absorption remains also elusive in vivo. FATP4 inhibitors do not display any effects on fat absorption in wild-type mice [51]. Similarly, no change in lipid fecal elimination and weight gain is found in FATP4+/− mice subjected to standard or high fat diets [50]. Unfortunately, deletion of both FATP4 alleles results in embryonic lethality by reason of dramatic perinatal skin defect [50]. To produce viable FATP4−/− mice and explore further its physiological role in intestinal fat absorption, the skin phenotype has been recently rescued using an FATP4 transgene driven by a keratinocyte-specific promoter [57]. These FATP4-null mice and their wild-type littermates display indistinguishable intestinal TAG absorption or fecal fat output when they are fed with a standard chow. The lack of effect being not due to compensatory induction of other LBP, it has been concluded that FATP4 is dispensable for fat absorption in the mouse. However, an increase in the enterocyte TAG levels was found when FATP4−/− mice were subjected to a high fat/cholesterol diet suggesting an involvement of FATP4 in the TAG processing [57]. It is noteworthy that TAG re-esterification takes place in the ER membrane which is also the main expression site for FATP4 gene. Therefore, it is likely that the ACS-like function of FATP4 is involved in the metabolic fate of TAG in the mouse enterocyte. The fact that the human FATP4 Gly-209-Ser polymorphism is associated with a decrease in post-prandial triacylglycerolemia and chylomicron/remnant ratio may be consistent with this assumption [58].

#### 2.4.3. CD36

CD36 is a 88 kDa transmembrane glycoprotein firstly identified in rat adipocytes by labelling with sulfo-N-succinimidyl derivates of LCFA under conditions where LCFA uptake was significantly inhibited [33]. CD36 is a multifunctional protein homologous to the class B scavenger receptor SR-B1. CD36 increases the uptake of LCFA by cardiomyocytes and adipocytes [59,60] and that of oxidized-LDL by macrophages [61], modifies platelet aggregation by binding to thrombospondin and collagen [62], facilitates the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells by macrophages [63] and increases the cyto-adhesion of erythrocytes infected with *Plasmodium falciparum* [64,65]. In addition, CD36 has also recently been shown to play a role in the taste-reception of dietary lipids on the tongue [66,67]. Analysis of its amino-acid sequence predicts a receptor-like structure. Two transmembrane domains located near the N- and C-terminal tails result in a hairpin configuration with a
large extracellular hydrophobic domain [68,33,69]. CD36 binds ionized LCFA with an affinity in the nanomolar range and a stoichiometry of 3 mol FA by 1 mol protein [70,71]. Compelling evidence shows that it plays a significant role in lipid transfer in adipose tissue and heart (reviewed [72]). Indeed, CD36 gene disruption leads to a high blood FFA level and an inability to perform intense efforts in the mouse [73,74]. Similar function might also exist in the small intestine. Indeed, CD36 expression level (mRNA and protein) is especially high in the duodeno–jejunum, the major site of fat absorption [75]. Immunocytochemical studies in rats and humans demonstrate that CD36 is strictly localized in the brush border membrane of well differentiated enterocytes [75,76]. Moreover, intestinal CD36 gene expression has been shown to parallel lipids contents of diets. Indeed, jejunal mRNA levels are significantly up-regulated, when rats are chronically submitted to a high fat diet [75] and down-regulated, when they are fed a low fat chow [77]. However, CD36 function in gut remains a matter of debate. In isolated enterocytes, CD36 gene invalidation either impairs LCFA uptake [78] or has no effect [73]. In vivo, the lack of dramatic intestinal phenotype in CD36 null mice, as well as in patients with type I CD36 deficiency, seems to preclude a critical role in the net LCFA intestinal absorption [78–80]. Consistently with this assumption, no change in LCFA uptake is found in FAT/CD36-null mice using an in situ isolated jejunal loops, an in vivo technical known to respect both intestinal microclimate (i.e. unstirred water layer, cell polarization) and lymph/blood circulation (I.N., unpublished data). By contrast, a disappearance of CD36 in BBM of enterocytes is observed when starved rats or mice are refed a standard laboratory chow (I.N. et al., unpublished data). This phenomenon is rapid and strictly lipid-dependent. The mechanism responsible for this membrane change is presently unknown. A cellular internalization of CD36 via an endocytotic transport is possible. Indeed, it has been reported that CD36 is co-localized with Cav-1 in caveolae vesicles [81–83,56,84]. Such a transport might target LCFA toward the sites of lipoprotein synthesis (ER and Golgi, Fig. 1B). However, the efficiency of this transport system is questionable, especially during the post-prandial period. An alternative hypothesis is an involvement of CD36 in cell signalisation. As numerous receptors [85], ligand-induced internalization of CD36 is followed by an ubiquitin/proteasome-mediated degradation in the enterocyte (I.N. et al., unpublished data). This finding seems more consistent with a role as a receptor rather than an efficient lipid transporter. It is noteworthy that cytoplasmic C-terminal tail of CD36 is able to physically interact with Src kinases in various tissues [67,86–89]. This system might constitute a functional complex allowing a lipid sensing as it has been recently shown in the mouse taste buds [67,89]. Indeed, LCFA binding to lingual CD36 induces neuromediator release by taste receptor cells through a signalling cascade triggered by Scr kinases. Resulting lipid signal conveyed by gustatory pathway contributes to the spontaneous fat preference and cephalic phase of the digestion [67]. In the small intestine, a lipid-sensing might lead to metabolic adaptation at the origin of more efficient lipid handling by enterocytes. TAG retention in enterocytes and production of smaller chylomicrons occurring in CD36-null mice subjected to a high fat diet correlate quite well with this assumption [73,80,90]. Therefore, intestinal CD36 seems rather play a role in the lipoprotein synthesis and secretion than in LCFA uptake. Contribution of CD36 as an intestinal lipid sensor is also supported by recent data showing that CD36 can link dietary fat intake to satiety via the synthesis of the endocannabinoid oleoylethanolamide [91]. Recent identification of a CD36-related receptor responsible for the olfactory detection of a fatty acid-derived pheromone in Drosophila [92] suggests that the lipid-sensing function of CD36, previously reported in the mouse [66], may be widespread throughout the animal kingdom.

In conclusion, the direct contribution of plasma membrane LBP (FABPpm, FAPT4 and FAT/CD36) to the LCFA uptake seems unlikely in the small intestine. However in vivo experiments using transgenic mouse models suggest that they can affect the metabolic fate of LCFA in the enterocyte (Fig. 2).

### 3. Intracellular trafficking of LCFA

Once into the enterocyte, LCFA and FACoA are reversibly bound to fatty acid-binding proteins (FABPs) and acyl-CoA binding protein (ACBP), respectively (Fig. 1B).

#### 3.1. Why two different FABPs?

FABPs belong to a multigenic family of 14–15 kDa intracellular proteins exhibiting a high affinity for various hydrophobic molecules (LCFA, bile acids or retinoids) (for a review see [93]). Two different FABPs are expressed in the small intestine: the intestinal-type (I-FABP/FABP2) and the liver-type (L-FABP/FABP1). There is an extensive inter-species conservation of FABP peptide sequences since more than 80% homology exists between human and rat L-FABP. In contrast, there is less than 30% homology between I-FABP and L-FABP in a same species [94]. Despite specific peptide sequences, members of FABP family display a similar tertiary structure that consists of two α helices (αI, αII) and ten anti-parallel β strands (βA–βJ) organized in two almost orthogonal β sheets forming an hydrophobic pocket [95]. A “portal” region constituted by the α helices connected to the βC/βD and βE/βF strands allows the entry and exit of LCFA [95,96] (Fig. 3A). The small intestine constitutes a unique example of an organ in which two different FABPs are highly co-expressed. The physiological advantage of such specificity remains elusive. It is likely that I-FABP and L-FABP exert both common (redundant) and specific functions. I-FABP or L-FABP overexpression increases LCFA influx in cell lines in which these proteins are lacking, as fibroblastic L cells [97] and pluripotent mouse embryonic ES cells [98], or only one FABP-type is constitutively expressed, as hBRIE 380i (+I-FABP/−L-FABP) [99] and HepG2 (−I-FABP/+L-FABP) [100]. This driving force, which might participate in the high efficiency of intestinal LCFA uptake, is likely due to common trapping properties of these FABPs.

I-FABP is strictly confined to the small intestine. It only binds LCFA with a ratio of one mole for one mole of protein. Peptide YY specifically induces I-FABP gene expression in enterocyte-like hBRIE380i cells [101]. This regulatory peptide is secreted by ileal endocrine cells when dietary fat reaches the distal part of the gut. The fact that peptide YY acts as a paracrine agent might explain why I-FABP induction found in rodents subjected to a high fat diet is especially high in the ileum [102,103]. Using a resonance energy transfer assay, Hsu and Storch have demonstrated that the transfer of fluorescent anthroyloxy-FA from I-FABP to acceptor membrane vesicles takes place through a direct collisional interaction [104]. This exchange requires ionic interactions between few amino-acid residues of the helicoidal domain of I-FABP (Fig. 3A and B) with anionic phospholipids of membranes. In the helix-less mutant I-FABP obtained by site-directed mutagenesis, the collisional exchanges are fully suppressed. In these conditions, transfer of anthroyloxy-FA occurs by aqueous diffusion as reported for the L-FABP [105]. I-FABP may also utilize the membrane-protein interaction for LCFA acquisition [106]. Since LCFA delivered on the apical side of enterocytes are preferentially bound to I-FABP [107], this dynamic exchange system appears to be especially well adapted to facilitate a vectorial transport of dietary lipids from the BBM to cellular compartments devoted to lipoprotein synthesis. It is thought that the collision with a target membrane yields a conformational change in the flexible region of I-FABP backbone

constituted by the distal half of α-II helix and βC-βD turns (Fig. 3A). This event might trigger the “hinged opening” of the portal domain and facilitates LCFA release [108]. Therefore, a punctual modification in this molecular region of I-FABP might have significant functional consequences. Human Ala54Thr polymorphism of I-FABP gene is consistent with this hypothesis. One base substitution in

codon 54 of FABP2 gene leads to the change of Ala54 by Thr54 (Fig. 3A). Initially found in the Pima indians, this genetic polymorphism is associated with a high TAG plasma levels [109], an insulin resistance [110] and an increase in the body mass index [111]. The fact that Thr54 I-FABP displays a 2-fold greater affinity for LCFA than the Ala54 wild-protein might explain these metabolic disturbances [110]. Indeed, a greater avidity for LCFA of mutant I-FABP could lead to an increase in both cellular fatty acid uptake and TAG-rich lipoproteins synthesis [110]. According to this assumption, a dramatic rise in LCFA transport and TAG secretion is found in Thr54I-FABP-transfected Caco-2 cells as compared to cells transfected the wild-type isoform [112]. Similarly, organ-culture of jejunal explants expressing the Thr54 allele appears to be associated with a rise in TAG synthesis and chylomicron output [113]. Conversely, the down-regulation of I-FABP gene is associated with a decrease in the \[^{14}C\]-palmitate uptake, TAG synthesis and secretion in Caco-2 cells [114]. Collectively, these data suggest that a change in I-FABP binding properties and/or expression levels can affect the intestinal fat absorption. Paradoxically, I-FABP gene invalidation does not lead to a lipid malabsorption in the mouse [115]. Likewise, mouse I-FABP gene deficiency mimics human Thr54 mutation. Indeed, feeding a high fat diet increases weight gain, triacylglycerolemia and insulin resistance in male I-FABP-null mice [115]. Origin of these discrepancies remains unclear. One possibility might be that metabolic alterations induced by Thr54 mutation are secondary to a drop in LCFA transfer activity of I-FABP. Whatever the mechanism involved, these data clearly show that I-FABP and, thereby small intestine plays a role in the metabolic syndrome.

In contrast to I-FABP, L-FABP is also expressed in liver and, in a lesser extent, in kidneys. Because of a hydrophobic pocket much larger (440 Å3 versus 234 Å3 for the I-FABP) [94], L-FABP can bind 2 LCFA as well as various bulky hydrophobic molecules as bile acids [116] or heme [117]. This difference in volume cavity also affects LCFA binding affinities. Indeed, one of two binding sites of L-FABP exhibits a higher avidity for unsaturated LCFA (folded molecules) than I-FABP [118] (Fig. 3C). L-FABP displays other specificities not found for I-FABP. L-FABP-mediated transfer of LCFA takes place through an aqueous diffusion [104]. Its intestinal expression is up-regulated by LCFA through a PPAR-dependent mechanism [119]. L-FABP seems also to exert an active role as partner of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR), nuclear receptors considered as a cellular lipid sensor [120]. This positive regulatory loop associated to a binding ratio of LCFA to L-FABP/I-FABP of 3.3 [107] strongly suggest that L-FABP can act as an intracellular reservoir for LCFA. Through this action, L-FABP might support lipid metabolism when lipid supply is low as well as protect the cell against harmful effect of an excess of free fatty acid during post-prandial period. From a physiological point of view, this last function might be essential to maintain the intestinal mucosa integrity required to an efficient lipid absorption. Finally, a role of L-FABP in lipoprotein processing has been recently reported *in vitro*. L-FABP seems to contribute to the budding of ER membrane facilitating the formation of pre-chylomicron transfer vesicles (PCTV) which are subsequently targeted towards the Golgi apparatus [121]. The physiological relevance of this finding is supported by *in vivo* studies. Indeed, L-FABP gene disruption leads to a TAG retention in enterocytes associated with a decrease in intestinal TAG output in mice subjected to an acute lipid load [122]. The fact that L-FABP gene is tightly regulated by the lipid content of diet is also consistent with such a function. However, these effects are not reproduced when L-FABP-null mice were only fed a standard laboratory chow suggesting the existence of an alternative mechanism [122]. It is noteworthy that L-FABP-null mice grow normally what suggests a normal intestinal absorption

when the lipid content of diet is low as in the standard laboratory chow (4% lipids, w/w).

In summary, physiological functions of FABPs in the small intestine are likely more complex than those initially assigned (i.e. LCFA uptake and intracellular trafficking). Their respective structural features speak for a specialization at least in high dietary fat supply: I-FABP being predominantly devoted to the TAG-rich lipoprotein synthesis, while L-FABP might be involved in the formation of PCTV, membrane protection and gene regulation. Because I-FABP and L-FABP gene disruption does not lead to a severe phenotype in mice fed a low fat diet, existence of a functional redundancy to ensure a correct fat absorption, especially during the post-prandial period is likely. Double I-FABP/L-FABP knock-out mice might provide new insights concerning their respective physiological functions.

### 3.2. Acyl-CoA-binding protein: an housekeeping protein

Thio-esterification of LCFA in FA-CoA is an obligatory step initiating the cellular lipid metabolism. It is catalyzed by a set of membrane-associated ACSs. The newly synthesized FA-CoA which are not immediately metabolised are bound to a specific carrier protein, the acyl-CoA binding protein (ACBP) (Fig. 1). This LBP is an ubiquitous 10 kDa soluble FA-CoA transporter conserved from the yeast to the mammal (for a review see, [123]). The 86 amino-acid residues of ACBP are folded in four α-helix forming a boomerang structure [124,125]. The acyl chain of FA-CoA is buried in a hydrophobic groove of the binding pocket within it is totally protected from the aqueous solvent by its acyl-CoA head [126,127]. ACBP binds with a stoichiometry of 1:1 and an affinity in the nanomolar range both medium and long-chain FA-CoA [127,128]. In the small intestine from rats and mice, ACBP is co-expressed with FABPs in absorptive cells [129]. In rat, a similar ACBP mRNA level is found along the cephalo-caudal axis of the small intestine (I.N. et al., unpublished data) in contrast what is observed for L-FABP and I-FABP. The precise function of ACBP in this organ is not yet fully determined. ACBP might facilitate FA-CoA desorption from FATP4 and other ACSs and, thus, contribute to the lipoprotein synthesis (Fig. 2). Indeed, ACBP has been reported to regulate the cellular FA-CoA disposal for microsomal TAG synthesis [126]. The fact that the ACBP gene disruption leads to a drastic reduction in TAG accumulation in pre-adipocytes is consistent with this assumption [130]. The detection of ACBP and FA-CoA in the nucleus of different cells [131] suggests a possible interference of ACBP expression and/or FA-CoA disposal with fundamental regulatory pathways [130]. A working model illustrating the main steps involved in LCFA uptake and trafficking in the absorptive intestinal cells is proposed in Fig. 2.

## 4. Chylomicron assembly and trafficking

FA-CoA are rapidly re-esterified in TAG in the ER before to form pre-CM then CM in the Golgi apparatus (Fig. 4). During the last past years, significant progress in the understanding of molecular events responsible for CM assembly, trafficking and release have been realized (for recent reviews see, [132–134]).

### 4.1. Re-esterification step

Re-esterification of FA-CoA takes place in the ER membrane via two multi-enzymatic systems [135]. The 2-monoglyceride pathway, specific of the small intestine, is located in the smooth ER (SER). It is responsible for up to 80% of newly synthesized TAG during the post-prandial period. Enzymes of the α-glycerophosphate pathway, also active in the liver, are found on rough ER (RER). Their

activity is predominant during the interprandial and fasting periods. In contrast to the 2-monoglyceride pathway, which only produces TAG, α-glycerophosphate pathway leads also to the synthesis of phospholipids [136]. Whatever the pathways, the final reaction leading to TAG synthesis is catalyzed by the acyl-CoA-diacylglycerol acyltransferases (DGAT). Two unrelated DGAT, termed DGAT1 and DGAT2, are co-expressed in the small intestine [137,138]. Despite similar biochemical functions, these enzymes display several differences. DGAT1 is mainly expressed in the proximal small intestine [137,139] in which it represents 85–90% of the total DGAT activity, whereas DGAT2 is more importantly found in adipose tissue and liver [140]. DGAT2 appears to be located in the cytosolic side of the ER membrane [141]. In contrast, the active site of DGAT1 is located in the lumen of ER [138,142]. Therefore, intestinal TAG re-esterification takes place on the two sides of the ER membrane suggesting the existence of two different pools of newly synthesized TAG (Fig. 4). Consistently with this assumption, DGAT1 over-expression in the liver mainly leads to an increase in lipoprotein secretion, while over-expression of DGAT2 essentially produces a TAG accumulation in the cytoplasm as lipid droplets [143].

Paradoxically, DGAT1 gene disruption does not lead to a lipid malabsorption when mice were fed a standard laboratory chow (3% lipids, w/w). DGAT2-mediated synthesis of TAG might explain this data suggesting some functional redundancies between these two enzymes. However, a reduction of post-absorptive chylomicronemia and an accumulation of cytosolic lipid droplets in entero-

cytes are found in DGAT1-null mice subjected to a high fat diet [139]. Therefore, DGAT2 appears to be insufficient to fully compensate the absence of DGAT1 in a high fat situation. Direct investigation of DGAT2 gene role in the small intestine is presently lacking. Indeed, DGAT2 gene invalidation, leading to deep epidermal defects, is lethal soon after birth [140]. Generation of mice with targeted DGAT2 gene disruption in spatio-temporal manner will be required to explore further its function. It is noteworthy that the diacylglycerol transacylase [144] and the lecithine-cholesterol acyltransferases [145] can also constitute alternative pathways for the TAG synthesis in the small intestine. In brief, we can think that during post-prandial period TAG generated by DGAT1 are immediately available for the lipoprotein synthesis in contrast to TAG produced by DGAT2 which are mainly stored as a cytosolic pool.

### 4.2. TAG transfer in the endoplasmic reticulum

Existence of active DGAT on the two sides of ER membrane raises the question of mechanisms involved in the TAG delivery into ER cisternae. Existence of two complementary transfer systems is likely (Fig. 4). A first system is required for the delivering of FA-CoA to DGAT1 active site by reason to inability of these molecules to cross the membranes (Fig. 4, reaction 1). The carnitine acyl-transferase-like system, initially identified in hepatic microsomes [146], might assume such a function in the small intestine. Indeed,
the intraduodenal infusion of the specific carnitine palmitoyltransferase inhibitor etomoxir dramatically (~75%) decreases TAG output in lymph in rats subjected to a lipid load [142]. The second system allowing the TAG transfer into the endoplasmic reticulum cisternae involves the microsomal triacylglycerol transfer protein (MTP) (Fig. 4, reaction 2). Mainly expressed in the upper part of the villi of the proximal intestine [147], MTP is known to bind and shuttle neutral lipids within membranes [148]. It consists of two non covalently bound proteins. A 97 kDa subunit, which belongs to the large lipid-transfer protein superfamily [149], contains 3 functional domains allowing the association of MTP with ER membranes, the adsorption of neutral lipids (TAG and cholesterol esters) and the binding of the apolipoprotein B48 (ApoB48). A 55 kDa subunit, identified as the protein disulfide isomerase, promotes the proper folding of the large subunit promoting both its retention in ER and its binding properties. MTP appears to be the most important factor regulating the intestinal ApoB lipoprotein assembly and secretion [132,150]. First MTP binds and shuttles TAG molecules within ER membrane [151] because of its phospholipids and TAG transfer activity [152]. Second, the initial lipidation of ApoB48 occurs through a direct interaction with MTP. A physical interaction between MTP and ApoB48 has been demonstrated by using co-precipitation experiments [153]. When MTP and ApoB48 are co-expressed in Hela cells, that do not make lipoprotein particles, small dense lipoproteins are produced. This phenomenon appears to be strictly MTP-dependent since the lipoprotein is lacking in absence of the MTP expression vector [154]. It is thought that MTP is needed for a proper folding of ApoB48 and the formation of a secretion competent particle. Third, MTP protects nascent ApoB48 lipoprotein against a rapid proteolysis by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway [155,156]. Consistently with these functions, mice with conditional intestine-specific MTP deficiency develop a dramatic phenotype associating fat malabsorption, cytoplasmic lipid droplet accumulation and virtual disappearance of ApoB48 lipoproteins [157]. In human, a similar syndrome is found in patients with abetalipoproteinemia, a rare autosomal recessive disease due to structural defects in the MTP gene [158]. Conversely, the human polymorphism leading to an over-expression of MTP is associated with an increased blood level of Apo B48 bound to TAG-rich lipoprotein. [159]. Altogether these data demonstrate that MTP plays a significant rate-limiting role in lipoprotein synthesis (Fig. 4, reaction 2). MTP has also been identified in the Golgi apparatus [160] and in the BBM [161]. To date, the functional relevance of these observations remains elusive.

merge leading to the core expansion of the primordial lipoproteins and the synthesis of nascent lipoproteins (Fig. 4, reaction 5). Incorporation of apolipoprotein AIV (ApoAIV) to the nascent CM is thought to stabilize the particle. Such a function might explain why (i) the ApoIV gene expression is tightly correlated to the lipid content of the diet [165] and (ii) its over-expression produces larger CM [166,167].

### 4.4. Transfer of prechylomicrons to the Golgi

Transfer of pre-CM from SER to the Golgi constitutes the second rate-limiting step in the intestinal fat absorption [168]. It is a vectorial transport. In brief, the cargo buds from the SER membrane and forms pre-CM transfer vesicles (PCTV) which translocate to and fuse with the Golgi cis-membrane to deliver pre-CM in Golgi cisternae (Fig. 4, reaction 6). This targeted transport, specific of the small intestine, appears to be tightly controlled by a set of proteins [169,170,170–173]. The molecular mechanism at the origin of this transport is progressively elucidated. It has been recently shown that L-FABP plays a role in the SER membrane deformation leading to PCTV budding [121]. This unexpected function might explain why an impaired intestinal TAG secretion is found in L-FABP-null mice [122]. However, the mechanism involved remains elusive. It has been proposed that L-FABP organizes the PCTV budding-machinery under the control of the phosphorylation of a 9 KDa protein by PKCζ [173]. The PCTV membrane also contains a vectorial protein: the vesicle-associated membrane protein-7 (VAMP7) which belongs to the specific v-soluble-N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (v-SNARE) family. This protein, only found in the small intestine [172], seems to be crucial for the targeting of PCTV to the Golgi membrane. Indeed, the use of an antibody raised against VAMP7 leads to 85% decrease in the PCTV transfer [172]. Finally, PCTV fusion with the cis-Golgi membrane requires the presence of Sar1b protein, a member of coatomer II proteins (COPII) system [174]. Indeed, missense mutations of SARA2 gene encoding for the Sar1b protein is found both in CM retention disease and Anderson’s disease, two rare human pathologies characterized by a severe malabsorption, fat laden enterocytes and the inability to produce chylomicrons [169]. Final maturation of CM takes place in the Golgi through post-translational modification (i.e. glycolysation and addition of the minor apolipoproteins Apo A1, Apo CII and apo CIII (Fig. 4, reaction 7)).

### 4.5. Generation of intestinal lipid droplets

Both in the healthy mouse and human, a lipid load leads to the formation of lipid droplets in the cytoplasm of enterocytes [175–179]. Similar event can be reproduced *in vitro* in Caco-2 cells [180]. It is a transient intestinal steatosis due to the conjunction of highly efficient LCFA uptake and TAG re-esterification levels with the existence of two rate-limiting steps in the CM synthesis: MTP-mediated transfer of neutral lipids through ER membrane and vectorial targeting of PCTV into Golgi (Fig. 4). When the TAG synthetic rate is upper to their subsequent transfer into ER cisternae, DGAT1-synthesized TAG pile up on the cytosolic face of the ER and/or are formed at the external side of the ER membrane by DGAT2 [177] (Fig. 4, reaction 8). It is likely that these intestinal cytosolic lipid droplets are surrounded with a phospholipid monolayer as shown in liver cells [181]. Cytosolic TAG pool, accumulated during post-prandial period, is transient. It might provide substrates for the formation of TAG-rich lipoprotein during the interprandial period [177,176]. This pathway requires an efficient TAG hydrolysis (Fig. 4, reaction 9). Interestingly, several cytosolic and microsomal lipases, including pancreatic TAG lipase [182], hormone-sensible lipase [183] and arylacetamide deacetylase [184], have been identified in the enterocyte. Some of FFA released from

### 4.3. Pre-chylomicron synthesis

CM are large TAG-rich lipoprotein particles that transport dietary lipids from the small intestine to other locations in the body. CM synthesis is considered to be a three step process which occurs in the ER [132,152]. First, the primordial lipoprotein particles containing one molecule of Apo B48, phospholipids and small amounts of TAG are synthesized in the RER (Fig. 4, reaction 3). Synthesis of primordial lipoprotein particles requires the MTP-mediated lipidation of the newly synthesis ApoB48 which is an obligatory, non exchangeable, CM partner in contrast to other constitutive apolipoproteins. This fundamental role has been highlighted by using a mouse model producing ApoB only in the liver. In these animals, the lack of ApoB48 in the small intestine totally prevents the formation of CM and results in a severe intestinal fat malabsorption with appearance of large cytoplasmic lipid droplets [162]. Similarly, a drop in lymph CM levels associated with an accumulation of TAG in cytosol is found in mice programmed to produce only the ApoB100 in the small intestine [163,164]. Second, re-esterification of TAG and cholesterol esters in the SER leads to the formation of lipid droplets (Fig. 4, reaction 4). Third, these two particles

cytosolic TAG pool by lipases might also exit the enterocyte to be transported to the liver via the portal vein (Fig. 4, reaction 10).

5. Lessons learned from genomics

The generation of transgenic mouse models with a targeted knock-out or over-expression of genes involved in fat absorption as well as the identification of related human polymorphisms has evidenced several intestinal specific features (Table 1).

First, in contrast to what is demonstrated in muscles and adipose tissue, CD36 gene has only a neglected role in the intestinal LCFA uptake. This finding highlights that a direct generalization of a gene function found in one organ to another one, without to take in account of its own specificities (i.e. micro-environment and phenotype) is physiologically irrelevant. By contrast, intestinal CD36 plays a role in the metabolic fate of re-esterified TAG. Indeed, CD36 gene invalidation is associated with fat laden enterocytes and a decrease in lymphatic CM secretion. The molecular mechanism at the origin of these CD36-mediated effects must to be elucidated. Microclimate lining BBM explains why LCFA uptake by enterocytes remains efficient during a lipid load. In contrast, the rate-limiting steps in the fat absorption takes place at the ER and Golgi levels and are dependent of MTP and proteins responsible for the vectorial targeting of pre-CM into the Golgi (e.g. L-FABP, Sar1b).

Second, invalidation of several genes, considered for a long time as crucial for fat absorption (e.g. I-FABP, DGAT1), does not lead to a clear phenotype when animals are fed a standard chow. Metabolic redundancies (e.g. I-FABP versus L-FABP or DGAT1 versus DGAT2) are likely responsible for this observation. Existence of alternative pathways contributing to the efficiency of lipid absorption is of a great physiological interest. Indeed, they prevent an excessive fecal fat output and, hence, energy loss.

Third, genomics has contributed to reveal unexpected gene functions as, for instance, the role of L-FABP gene in the PCTV synthesis and transfer towards the Golgi. Targeted gene modifications specifically in the small intestine might provide new insights in intestinal fat absorption in a near future.

6. Do dietary lipids affect the intestinal function?

Chronic fat overconsumption increases the obesity risk in number of species. Although the small intestine is responsible for fat body disposal, its role in this phenomenon has been neglected. The fact that the small intestine has long been considered a simple selective barrier able to efficiently absorb dietary fat explains this paradox. Recent data strongly suggest that the high TAG bioavailability of intestine might be not attributable to inborn properties but acquired properties. Indeed, intestinal fat absorption capacity can be adapted to the fat content of the diet in the mouse. This fat-mediated adaptation takes place through two complementary events. First, there is a lipid-mediated induction of intestinal cell proliferation, which might lead to an increased absorptive area [103]. Consistent with this assumption, rat studies show that high fat diets increase the height of villi and induce the rate of enterocyte migration along the crypt-to-villus axis [185,186]. It is noteworthy that the effect of lipids on intestinal trophism appears to be more efficient than that of other nutrients. Second, mice subjected to a chronic high fat diet display a coordinate induction of genes (i.e. CD36, FATP4, I-FABP, L-FABP, MTP, Apo AIV). This lipid-mediated modification is rapid and adaptive since the gene
expression returns to control values when mice are re-fed a low fat diet [103,187]. Interestingly, these genes seem to play a significant role in the final size of CM by facilitating the expansion core of TAG in the CM, and hence, in their subsequent blood clearance by LPL. Moreover, it has been recently reported that lipid content of the diet is also able to modulate gene expression of secreted signalling molecules which could affect the metabolic homeostasis of peripheral organs [188]. All together, these emergent data highlight that the lipid-mediated impact on the small intestine could contribute to the etiology of metabolic disorders linked to a high fat diet.

### 7. Intestinal contribution to dyslipidemia

Hypertriacylglycerolemia is a metabolic disorder generally associated with insulin-resistance, obesity, metabolic syndrome. Adverse effects of a chronic post-prandial high TAG levels on cardio-vascular function is well established. Although CM and their remnants can be atherogenic [189], contribution of the small intestine in the genesis of this dyslipidemia is not much studied as compared to the liver implication. The fact that triacylglycerolemia is usually determined in fasted human can explain this paradox. However, it is well known that the plasma TAG level remains elevated for the most of the day even in subjects with normal fasting TAG [190,191]. Post-prandial triacylglycerolemia results not only from the TAG-rich lipoprotein secretion but also from their subsequent blood clearance by endothelial LPL. CM size and number are known to affect LPL activity and, hence, blood TAG clearance. A small number of large CM are more rapidly cleared by LPL than a large number of small CM [192–194]. CM size is highly dependent on expression levels of few genes expressed in the small intestine. For example, CD36-null mice secrete smaller CM than wild-type mice [90] and intestinal ApoAIV overexpression produces larger TAG-rich lipoproteins [166,167]. LPL activity is also under control of apolipoproteins CII (apoCII) and CIII (ApoCIII) acquired during the intestinal CM biogenesis (Fig. 4, reaction 7) or by exchange with hepatic lipoproteins. Apo CII is a co-factor which activates LPL. For this reason, the low lipolytic activity of LPL found in Apo CII-deficient human can be corrected by the addition of Apo CII [195]. In contrast, Apo CIII is an LPL inhibitor. Therefore, ApoCII/ApoCIII ratio found in CM determines the efficiency of their blood clearance by LPL.

Generally, fat feeding increases the size of the CM particles rather than their number [196]. However, this effect is highly dependent from the quality of dietary lipids. A diet rich in unsaturated fatty acids leads to larger CM than a diet containing mainly saturated fatty acids [197–199]. The nature of absorbed fatty acids also affects their blood clearance. In the mouse, a high fat diet mainly composed of monounsaturated fatty acids specifically up-regulates the expression of ApoCII gene but down-regulates the ApoCIII gene in the small intestine. This change, not reproduced in the liver, might explained why mice subjected to this diet displayed a lower post-prandial triacylglycerolemia than mice fed standard chow [103]. In humans, studies have shown that post-prandial blood lipid levels are also highly dependent of the fatty acid composition of the test meal (SFA > MUFA > PUFA) (for a review, see [200]).

The intestinal impact on the blood TAG levels seems to be still more important during insulin-resistance [201]. Enterocytes from insulin-resistant hamsters secrete more TAG, more ApoB48 and thus a greater number of chylomicrons than controls [202]. Similar alterations has been also found *in vivo* in diabetic rabbit [203], and as initially suggested by the Tomkin’s team [204], in humans [205].

### 8. Conclusions and future directions

This review illustrates the remarkable capacity of the small intestine to absorb dietary fat. Modulation of intestinal plasticity (i.e. cell proliferation and coordinate gene regulation) by dietary lipids and the existence of compensatory redundant mechanisms allow the adaptation of the fat absorption to the lipid content of the diet. This lipid-mediated adaptability appears to be sufficient to prevent an excessive lipid elimination in faeces when fat supply is enhanced. This physiological feature maximizes the absorption of foods known to be rich in energy, in essential fatty acids and in lipid-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K) which display numerous fundamental biological functions. Likely inherited from evolution, these lipid-mediated intestinal adaptations might constitute an advantage allowing the survival in an environment of food scarcity. Conversely, it might contribute to increase the prevalence of obesity and related diseases during periods of food abundance. Nevertheless, molecular mechanisms responsible for this adaptation are yet not fully understood. For instance, the regulator(s) at the origin the coordinated modulation of genes responsible for intestinal metabolic fate of dietary lipids remains to be determined. The small intestine also secretes numerous substances that may also stimulate intestinal adaptation under certain extreme conditions as high fat feeding, and this idea is being explored. A better understanding of the mechanisms leading to lipid-dependent intestinal adaptation may provide new therapeutic approaches and/or dietary recommendations allowing the optimisation of blood CM clearance and, hence, decrease prevalence of fat-mediated diseases in the population.
