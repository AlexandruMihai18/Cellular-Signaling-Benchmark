### Abstract  
The natural habitat of *Staphylococcus aureus* in humans is the moist squamous epithelium of the anterior nares. Several bacterial surface proteins are implicated in promoting adhesion to desquamated epithelial cells. Clumping factor B (ClfB) and iron-regulated surface determinant A both promote nasal colonization in rodent models, and in the case of ClfB, humans. One of the ligands involved in adhesion is cytokeratin 10. Reduction in nasal colonization can be achieved by active and passive immunization. *S. aureus* is well endowed with secreted and surface components that compromise innate immune responses, particularly the function of neutrophils. *S. aureus* secretes proteins that reduce migration of neutrophils from the bloodstream to the site of infection by impeding diapedesis and receptors for chemotactic molecules. Several secreted proteins interfere with complement C3 and C5 convertases, thus reducing the level of C3b opsonin and the chemotactic peptide C5a. Host proteases are recruited to the cell surface to enhance destruction of opsonic C3b and IgG. Surface components ClfA, protein A and polysaccharide capsule compromise the recognition of opsonins on the bacterial cell surface. If engulfed by neutrophils the intracellular bacterium can resist reactive oxygen intermediates, nitric oxide radicals, defensin peptides and bactericidal proteins. A prior infection by *S. aureus* does not induce complete protective immunity. This could be due to immunosuppression caused by expression of superantigen proteins that disrupt normal activation of T cells and B cells during antigen presentation. By studying the molecular pathogenesis of *S. aureus* infections markers might be found for investigating *S. pseudintermedius* infections of dogs.

### Introduction  
There are more than 30 species in the genus *Staphylococcus* but only two, *S. aureus* and *S. epidermidis*, are responsible for the majority of infections in man caused by this group of organisms. The newly described species *S. pseudintermedius* is associated with pyoderma in dogs.¹ Each organism is primarily a commensal and normally lives in harmony with its host without causing symptoms. *S. epidermidis* is a commensal of the skin of human and was rarely pathogenic before the advances in medical procedures involving implanted medical devices. In contrast, *S. aureus* is potentially much more pathogenic. Its primary habitat is the moist squamous epithelium of the anterior nares,² an area that is defended by the nasal-associated lymphoid tissue (NALT) involving both innate and induced immune responses. It has been argued that *S. epidermidis* lacks the complexity of *S. aureus* because it is adapted to exist on the skin surface where the transmission from host to host is straightforward.³ In contrast, in order for *S. aureus* to be transmitted from one host to another it must first be transferred from the nares to the skin of the donor, then to the skin of the recipient and finally it must colonize the nares where it must overcome the NALT-controlled immune responses. Furthermore, not all hosts are available because only a proportion of humans can be permanently colonized and because of interference if the host is already colonized with a *S. aureus* strain. It could therefore be argued that virulence factors and immune avoidance mechanisms of *S. aureus* are mainly concerned with colonization of the hostile environment of the nares which are protected by innate and induced immunity. Similarly for *S. epidermidis* the primary function of factors that help it to infect susceptible hosts is to promote survival on skin. *S. pseudintermedius* expresses several adhesins and extracellular toxins and enzymes similar to those of *S. aureus*. It remains to be established if the repertoire of immune evasion mechanisms to be described below are also found in this organism.

This purpose of this review is to discuss how staphylococci avoid innate and induced immunity both in the commensal state and when they cause infection. There is considerable overlap between the two so most of the discussion will refer to disease pathogenesis, with the exception of mechanisms that seem to be involved only in promoting survival externally. Immune evasion strategies will be categorized according to whether they impede leukocyte migration, the fixation of complement, the recognition of opsonins by neutrophils, the survival of bacteria within professional phagocytic cells or the effective induction of antibodies and immunological memory.

# Colonization

## Adhesion

The ability of *S. aureus* to colonize the hostile environment of the anterior nares is likely to be determined in part by its ability to adhere to desquamated cells on the epithelial surface of the nasal vestibule. Five surface proteins of *S. aureus* have been shown to promote adhesion to squamous cells *in vitro*. Clumping factor B (ClfB) is so-named because its of ability to bind to fibrinogen. The ClfB protein also binds to cytokeratin 10 which is a major component of squamous cells. Cytokeratin 10 is exposed on the surface of squamous cells and is likely provide a receptor for ClfB. The nasal mucosa is an iron-restricted environment that stimulates expression of several iron-regulated surface determinant (Isd) proteins. As well as being involved in iron acquisition and survival on skin and mucosa, the IsdA protein also promotes bacterial adhesion to squames. In experiments with bacteria lacking ClfB or IsdA that were grown in iron-restricted conditions, both surface proteins were shown to contribute significantly to bacterial adhesion to squamous cells. In addition SdrC, SdrD and SasG promote adhesion of bacteria to squamous cells, but their ligands are not known. Furthermore IsdA or ClfB mutants were defective in colonization of the nares of rodents, and in the case of ClfB, human volunteers, showing that the proteins have a role *in vivo*. There is no information on any role for surface proteins of *S. epidermidis* in colonizing the skin. *S. pseudintermedius* strains can adhere to immobilized human cytokeratin 10 which suggests that colonization of canine skin might involve similar interactions to those of *S. aureus*.

When *S. aureus* colonizes the nasal mucosa it is exposed to innate and induced immune responses. The absence of colonizing bacteria in approximately 20% of the population and the fact that a further 20% are persistent carriers suggests that host factors play a role in nasal colonization. Polymorphisms in the glucocorticoid receptor are associated with differences in the immune status of the host. Individuals with haplotype 3 which is associated with immune enhancement have a 68% lower carriage rate whereas those with haplotype 5 which is associated with immune suppression have an 80% increase carriage rate. This suggests that the immune status of the host contributes to colonization. An interleukin 4 gene promoter polymorphism is associated with lower IL-4 serum concentrations and reduced mucin. Individuals with this polymorphism have an increased rate of persistent carriage suggesting a role for mucin in clearance, contrary to earlier suggestions that adhesion to mucin is a colonization factor. Polymorphisms in other genes encoding components of the immune system (C reactive protein, mannose binding lectin, complement factor H, complement C1 inhibitor) have been associated with increased or decreased carriage but hypotheses concerning mechanisms are not obvious.

## Survival on skin

One of the unique features of the community-associated Meticillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (CA-MRSA) strain USA-300 is the presence of the arginine catabolic mobile element (ACME) that is integrated directly adjacent to the type IV staphylococcal cassette chromosome (SCCmec cassette). ACME carries a cluster of genes encoding enzymes of the arginine deiminase pathway that converts arginine into carbon dioxide, ATP and ammonia. These genes occur in some strains of *S. epidermidis* but had not been detected before in *S. aureus*. It is postulated that production of ammonia aids pH homeostasis in the acid environment of the skin and could help bacterial survival. The possible acquisition of ACME by horizontal transfer from *S. epidermidis* might help explain why CA-MRSA strains have spread so rapidly in the community.

Fatty acids present in sebum are an important part of the anti-bacterial defences of the skin. Cis-6-hexadecanoic acid is the most potent bactericidal fatty acid against *S. aureus*. In order to defend against hydrophobic molecules the IsdA protein (mentioned above in the context of adhesion to squamous cells) makes the cell surface hydrophilic. This is due to the amino acid composition of the C-terminal domain of the extended asymmetric protein, which is a major component of the surface of bacterial cells growing under iron-restricted conditions. An *isdA* mutant was much more sensitive to killing *in vitro* by bactericidal lipids and the mutant survived poorly on the surface of human skin compared to the wild-type. IsdA-defective mutants are also more sensitive to cationic antimicrobial peptides (see the following text).

Resisting the bactericidal effects of both cationic and noncationic antimicrobial peptides is likely to be of major importance in the ability of staphylococci to survive on skin. The mechanisms involved are discussed below in the context of survival within phagocytes.

## Inhibition of neutrophil migration

As soon as *S. aureus* gains access to tissues in the body, several different chemoattractants are elaborated that stimulate the migration of neutrophils from the blood stream to the site of infection. Two small peptides, C3a and C5a, are released during complement fixation by cleavage of C3 and C5 respectively. They diffuse away from the bacterial cell, creating a concentration gradient. Bacterial proteins are translated with formyl methionine at their amino termini. Short formyl peptides are cleaved from newly synthesized bacterial proteins and are secreted, also creating a concentration gradient. Formyl peptides are not the only chemoattractants released by bacteria. A formyltransferase mutant lacking the ability to formylate methionine continued to secrete molecules with neutrophil chemoattractant activity, indicating that other metabolites or secreted proteins/peptides contribute to this activity. Each chemoattractant is recognized by a specific G protein-coupled receptor on the neutrophil which stimulates the process of migration.

Several steps are involved in the recruitment of neutrophils (Figure 1). First, during inflammation P-selectin is translocated to the surface of endothelial cells lining blood vessels. Its release from the Weibel-Palade bodies is triggered by histamine and thrombin. The P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) on circulating neutrophils binds P-selectin and initiates the process of neutrophil

Figure 1. Inhibition of neutrophil migration by *Staphylococcus aureus*. As infection becomes established chemical signals such as complement degradation products and N-formylated peptides released from growing bacteria form a chemotactic gradient. Inflammation of endothelial cells lining the blood vessels triggers neutrophil rolling and migration into surrounding tissue.

rolling which eventually captures the phagocytic cell allowing it to migrate into adjacent tissue.

Staphylococcal superantigen-like 5 (SSL5) is a small protein expressed by one of a family of ss/genes located in pathogenicity island 2. Different strains express between 7 and 11 SSL proteins which have between 36% and 67% identity.³⁰,³¹ They have high structural similarity to enterotoxin superantigens but lack superantigenic activity because residues involved in binding major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC class II) to the T-cell receptor (TCR) are absent.³² SSL5 specifically binds to PSGL-1 and inhibits binding to P-selectin in vitro and prevents neutrophil rolling on activated endothelial cells.³³ SSL5 and the closely related SSL11 both bind with high affinity to sialyl Lewis X glycan chains that are important determinants of PSGL-1 binding to P-selectin.³⁴,³⁵ Thus SSL5 and possibly SSL11 have the potential to stop the first step in neutrophil recruitment in vivo.

To migrate from the bloodstream, neutrophils must adhere firmly to endothelial cells. This is mediated by the β2 integrins Mac-1 and leukocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) on leukocytes that interact with the counter-receptor intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) on endothelial cells. The extracellular adherence protein (Eap), also known as MHC class II analogue protein (Map), can bind to a multiplicity of ligands including ICAM-1 where it blocks the interaction with LFA-1 and reduces neutrophil attachment to and transmigration through endothelial cells called diapedesis.³⁶ In vitro studies were supported by a mouse peritonitis model where an Eap mutant allowed recruitment of more neutrophils than the wild-type strain.

Migration from the blood vessels following diapedesis to the site of infection involves activation of several G protein-coupled receptors by chemoattractants.³⁷ *S. aureus* can synthesize several small proteins that specifically and potently block receptors and inhibit leukocyte activation and migration. The chemotaxis inhibitory protein of staphylococci (CHIPS) binds to the formyl peptide receptor (FPR) and the C5a receptor (C5aR).³⁸ This blocks the co-

Complement

Complement is a family of proteins and proteolytic fragments derived from them that have many roles in innate and acquired immunity.⁴⁴ With *S. aureus*, complement recruits effector molecules that label the bacteria and target them for destruction by immune effector cells such as neutrophils. The process of complement fixation occurs by three pathways (Figure 2). The alternative and lectin pathways are components of innate immunity whereas the classical pathway requires specific interaction with antibodies that have bound to antigens on the surface of bacterial cells. One of the main purposes of complement fixation is opsonization—to promote phagocytosis by neutrophils and macrophages. The neutrophils recognize the Fc region of immunoglobulin G (IgG) by a specific receptor FcγRI and complement proteins bound to the bacterial cell surface by receptors CR1 and CR3. It is becoming apparent that *S. aureus* expresses several distinct mechanisms to

Figure 2. Complement fixation. Three pathways lead to the deposition of the opsonin C3b on the bacterial cell surface. The lectin and classical pathways trigger the activation of the C3 convertase C2aC4b which promotes accumulation of C3b. C3b will bind to C2aC4b to create the C5 convertase which cleaves C5 into C5b on the cell surface and releases the chemoattractant C5a. The alternative pathway stems from spontaneous conversion of C3 to C3b which binds to Bb to form an alternative C3 convertase (C3bBb) which in turn is converted to the alternative C5 convertase C3bBbC3b. Downstream activation events leading to formation of the membrane attack complex are not shown because they are not relevant to a gram-positive bacterium.

interfere with complement by inactivation or sequestration of key components and that this is crucial to the success of the pathogen.

### Inactivation of complement

Assembly of C3 convertases on the surface of *S. aureus* is a prerequisite for complement activation (Figure 2).^{44,45} The structurally and functionally related C4bC2a (classical and lectin pathways) and C3bBb (alternative pathway) carry out the essential function of cleaving C3, which results in the release of the C3a chemoattractant peptide and covalent attachment of the opsonin C3b to the bacterium. *S. aureus* secretes a small protein called staphylococcus complement inhibitor (SCIN) which binds to and stabilizes both C4bC2a and C3bBb resulting in inhibition of further C3b formation.^{46} Normally C3 convertases are transiently active with dissociation leaving the bound C4b and C3b to act as cofactors for further cleavage of C2 and factor B respectively. Stabilization of the complexes by the secreted *S. aureus* protein SCIN blocks the crucial amplification loop and is a potent mechanism for preventing complement activation. Preventing C3b formation ultimately inhibits C5 convertase activity and reduces the potent neutrophil chemoattractant C5a. SCIN was shown to block phagocytosis and killing of *S. aureus* cells by human neutrophils.^{46}

*S. aureus* strains express a protein Sbi with sequence similarity to protein A (Spa: see below). The N-terminus of Sbi comprises four modules, two of which are similar to protein A IgG binding domains and two of which interact with complement protein C3.^{47,48} The protein was originally thought to be exposed on the cell surface like Spa but recently it was shown to be extracellular where it activates the alternative pathway resulting in futile fluid phase consumption of complement C3 and possibly contributes to reduction in the efficiency of opsonization.

*S. aureus* has the ability to inactivate complement factor C3b and IgG molecules that are bound to the surface of opsonized bacterial cells. Host plasminogen can attach to the surface of *S. aureus* cells where it is bound in 1:1 stoichiometry by staphylokinase, a plasminogen activator protein that is secreted by many strains of *S. aureus*.^{49} The potent serine protease activity of plasminogen is activated in the Sak–Plg complex and it is strategically placed to cleave surface-bound C3b and IgG molecules resulting in reduced phagocytosis by neutrophils.^{50}

Complement factors I and H are natural down-regulators of complement fixation that prevent uncontrolled activation.^{26,27} Normally factor H binds to immobilized C3b and subsequently factor I binds and its protease function is activated and it cleaves C3b to iC3b. Whereas both C3b and iC3b are recognized by specific receptors on neutrophils and therefore promote uptake, iC3b cannot activate the alternative pathway or the terminal cascade and is further degraded to C3d. *S. aureus* cells can capture and activate factor I independently of factor H which results in increased level of iC3b on the cell surface, a decrease in total C3 fragments on cells and a reduction in phagocytosis of bacteria by human neutrophils.^{51,52} Recently, the fibrinogen-binding surface protein clumping factor A was implicated in factor I capture and activation. This could in part explain the anti-phagocytic effect of ClfA.^{53}

### Binding complement components

The extracellular fibrinogen-binding protein (Efb) can also bind to complement factor C3.^{54,55} The structural basis of Efb-C3 interaction is understood from the X-ray crystal structure of the two proteins in complex.^{56} The biological consequences deriving from Efb and Ecb binding to C3 domains are to block convertases containing C3b.^{57} These are the alternative pathway C3b convertase C3bBb

and the C5 convertases from the classical and lectin pathway (C4bC2aC3b) and from the alternative pathway (C3bBbC3b). The consequence is a reduction in the chemoattractant C5a and reduced neutrophil recruitment.

# Resistance to phagocytosis

*Staphylococcus aureus* expresses several surface-associated anti-opsonic proteins and a polysaccharide capsule that can both interfere with the deposition of antibodies and complement by classical and alternative pathways, or with their access to the neutrophil complement and Fc receptors. Efficient phagocytosis by neutrophils that requires recognition of bound complement and antibody is thus compromised. This is summarized in Figure 3.

## Surface proteins

Protein A is a wall-anchored protein with four or five domains that can each bind to the Fc region of IgG. Residues from helix I and helix II of the triple helical bundle required for binding IgG Fc are well-known from the X-ray structure of the complex and from site-directed mutagenesis studies. The interaction between protein A and IgG coats the surface of the cell with IgG molecules that are in the incorrect orientation to be recognized by the neutrophil Fc receptor and for activation of complement by the classical pathway. This explains the anti-phagocytic effect of protein A *in vitro* and why it is a virulence factor in several models of animal infection.

Clumping factor A (ClfA) is the major fibrinogen-binding protein on the surface of cells from the stationary phase of growth. The *clfA* gene is switched on by a sigma factor B-dependent promoter stimulating substantially higher levels in stationary phase compared with exponential phase when the gene is expressed from a weaker Sig70-dependent promoter. The N-terminal A domain of ClfA binds to the γ-chain of fibrinogen. When cells are densely packed together in suspension the γ-chain C-termini located at either end of the elongated bivalent fibrinogen molecule can simultaneously bind to two ClfA molecules on two different bacterial cells, which results in cell clumping. However, *in vivo* the density of cell is too low for clumping to occur. Instead bacterial cells are coated with fibrinogen molecules. ClfA is a virulence factor in a murine model of sepsis and arthritis. Virulence is enhanced during the bacteremic phase. Cells become coated with fibrinogen which likely results in impaired deposition and/or recognition of opsonins. *In vitro*, ClfA expression reduces opsonophagocytosis by human neutrophils in the presence of normal serum opsonins which is in part due to the ability of the molecule to bind fibrinogen. Bacteria expressing a mutant derivative of ClfA that lacks the ability to bind fibrinogen were still partially protected from opsonophagocytosis. This could be due to the ability of ClfA to activate factor I resulting in enhanced destruction of opsonin C3b. It seems possible that fibronectin binding proteins and ClfB, which also bind fibrinogen, can protect bacteria in a similar way during the exponential phase of growth when these proteins are predominantly expressed.

When neutrophils lyse they release DNA which forms extracellular traps that bind to and kill bacteria. *Streptococcus pneumoniae* and *S. pyogenes* both secrete DNases which have been shown to be virulence factors because of their ability to degrade the released anti-bacterial DNA. It is likely that the thermonuclease of *S. aureus* can protect cells in the same way.

## Capsule

Most strains of *S. aureus* express a microcapsule that is composed of serotype 5, serotype 8 or serotype 336 capsular polysaccharide. Expression of type 5 or type 8 capsule is associated with increased virulence in animal infection models. *In vitro* the presence of capsule reduced uptake of bacterial cells by human neutrophils in the presence of normal serum opsonins which shows that the capsule is anti-opsonic. Complement factors can assemble on the cell wall surface beneath the capsule but are inaccessible to complement receptors on the surface of neutrophils.

Many strains of *S. aureus* carry genes for the synthesis of the polysaccharide intercellular adhesion (PIA), an extracellular polysaccharide that is of particular importance in *S. epidermidis* infections. The role of this surface polymer in biofilm formation and avoidance of phagocytosis is discussed in the section on *S. epidermidis*.

## Secreted proteins

*Staphylococcus aureus* can produce several toxins that damage the membranes of host cells. Cytolytic toxins that target leukocytes (leukotoxins) contribute to the development of abscesses by killing neutrophils that are

Figure 3. *Staphylococcus aureus* surface and secreted factors that inhibit phagocytosis. The polysaccharide capsule and the cell surface-located proteins protein A and clumping factor A each contribute to a reduction in opsonophagocytosis of *S. aureus* by neutrophils. The capsule blocks recognition of opsonins, protein A binds to the Fc region of IgG which cannot be recognized by the neutrophil Fc receptor or promote complement fixation, whereas ClfA binding fibrinogen masks opsonins and capture of complement regulatory factor I causes enhanced degradation of C3b. Secreted cytolytic toxins interfere with neutrophil function by causing membrane damage. Secreted protein SSL7 binds to the Fc region of IgA and potentially blocks recognition by neutrophils.

attempting to engulf and kill bacteria. The archetypal toxin that forms β-barrel pores in the cytoplasmic membrane of target cells is α-toxin. It is secreted as a monomer which attaches to the membrane of cells. Monomers assemble into a heptamer in the membrane with β-strands from each monomer forming a 14-stranded β-barrel that spans the membrane creating a pore.⁷⁸ The bi-component leukotoxins comprise two subunits that are secreted separately and assemble into hexameric or heptameric oligomers in the membranes of leukocytes. There are four types of bicomponent leukotoxin, the γ-toxin or γ-haemolysin, the Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL), leukocidin E/D and leukocidin M/F-PV-like. The γ-toxin lyses membranes of both erythrocytes and leukocytes whereas PVL is only toxic for leukocytes.⁷⁹

The *hlg* locus is present in the chromosome of the majority of *S. aureus* strains whereas the *pvl* genes encoding PVL are present in a converting bacteriophage which occurs only in 1–2% of strains.⁸⁰,⁸¹ There is a strong association between PVL and severe skin infections suggesting that PVL enhances virulence. Recently CA-MRSA strains have emerged that cause severe necrotizing pneumonia and contagious severe skin infections in previously healthy individuals.⁸²,⁸³ PVL has been shown to be a virulence factor in an adult mouse model of pneumonia contradicting an earlier claim that it does not enhance virulence in animal infection models.⁸⁴,⁸⁵ It is likely that CA-MRSA strains evolved by acquisition of a type IV or type V SCCmec that encodes resistance to β-lactam antibiotics and by lysogenization with a *pvl*-converting phage.²³,⁸⁶

*S. aureus* expresses several small cytolytic peptides that at low concentrations recruit and activate neutrophils triggering an inflammatory response whereas at higher concentrations they cause neutrophil lysis.⁸⁷ CA-MRSA strains express higher levels of the toxins than laboratory strains which might in part explain their enhanced virulence.

Secreted superantigen-like protein SSL7 binds to IgA and blocks recognition by the neutrophil receptor FcαRI.⁸⁸,⁸⁹ If SSL7 blocks IgA bound to antigens on the bacterial cell surface this will impede phagocytosis.

### Survival of *S. aureus* in neutrophil phagosomes

If *S. aureus* is engulfed by neutrophils it is well endowed with mechanisms that help it to survive in the phagosome (Figures 4 and 5). In *in vitro* phagocytosis assays with human neutrophils a significant fraction of engulfed bacterial cells survive. In addition, *S. aureus* can survive for many days in primary human macrophages which remain unaffected by the intracellular bacteria until eventually organisms start proliferating and the macrophages die. This suggests that *S. aureus* can remain dormant in human macrophages as has been reported for mouse macrophages.⁹⁰ In mice macrophage-carrying bacteria helped disseminate the infecting organisms around the body.

### Resistance to antimicrobial peptides

Modification to teichoic acids and to a membrane phospholipid result in an increase in positive charges on the cell surface that neutralize the negative charge of cationic antimicrobial defensin peptides that are secreted into the phagosome. The Dlt proteins result in D-alanine substitutions of ribitol teichoic acid and lipoteichoic acid whereas the MprF protein adds a L-lysine residue to phosphatidylglycerol exposed on the outer face of the cytoplasmic membrane.⁹¹⁻⁹³ These modifications also protect bacteria from antimicrobial peptides on the surface of skin¹⁰ as well as positively charged antimicrobial proteins in serum such as phospholipase A2 and lactoferrin. Mutants defective in Dtl and MprF are more susceptible to killing by cationic antimicrobial peptides *in vitro* and have markedly reduced virulence in several animal infection models.⁹⁴⁻⁹⁶ Transcriptional profiling of *S. epidermidis* identified genes that were upregulated after treatment with human β-defensin including a three-component regulatory system called the antimicrobial peptide sensor (Aps, Figure 5).⁹⁷ As well as a typical histidine protein kinase sensory component ApsS and a response regulator ApsR, the Aps system also includes a third protein component ApsX, the function of which is not yet understood. The ApsS protein has two transmembrane segments with a

Its peptidoglycan is resistant to lysozyme. The negative charge of the cell surface is neutralized by modification of cell wall teichoic acid and membrane lipid with substitutions of positively charged amino acids causes resistance to cationic antimicrobial peptides. DNA released from damaged neutrophils has intrinsic antibacterial activity which could be neutralized by the secreted deoxyribonuclease.

Small cationic peptide defensin

Figure 5. Induction of mechanisms that reduce susceptibility to antimicrobial peptides. *Staphylococcus aureus* responds to the presence of both anionic and cationic antimicrobial peptides by inducing factors that neutralize their activities. A membrane-bound sensor ApsS is activated by defensins and in turn triggers its partner response regulator ApsR which induces transcription of (i) genes encoding an efflux system that eliminates defensins from the membrane and (ii) the *dtl* and *mrpF* genes that encode systems that modify the teichoic acid and membrane lipids (Figure 4). The secreted protein staphylokinase can bind to and neutralize cationic peptides. The SasS sensor is thought to recognize anionic peptides such as dermicidin. When activated, the SaeRS regulatory system influences global regulators SarA and Agr and indirectly triggers expression of the metalloproteases aureolysin (in *S. aureus*) and SepA (in *S. epidermidis*) which destroy antimicrobial peptides.

short negatively charged loop on the external face of the cytoplasmic membrane that is involved in recognizing positively charged antimicrobial peptides. A wide variety of cationic peptides can activate this Aps system. Aps upregulates expression of the *dtl* operon that controls modification of teichoic acid and the *mrpF* gene for modifying phospholipids, as well as a putative ABC transporter VraFG that could be involved in expelling antimicrobial peptides. The Aps regulatory system is well conserved among staphylococci so it is most likely that *S. aureus* responds to antimicrobial peptides in the same way as *S. epidermidis*.

The Aps system does not respond to noncationic antimicrobial peptides such as dermicidin that are also present on skin, epithelial surfaces and in neutrophil granules. Exposure of *S. epidermidis* to dermicidin stimulated upregulation of a metalloprotease SepA that is similar to aureolysin of *S. aureus*. A SepA-defective mutant was more sensitive to dermicidin consistent with the protease being responsible for degrading the noncationic peptide. Dermicidin also stimulated up-regulation of proteases in *S. aureus* so it is likely that proteases can protect against both cationic and noncationic peptides during infection by this organism.

*Staphylococcus aureus* secretes proteins that can neutralize cationic peptides. Staphylokinase is a prothrombin activator that stimulates dissolution of fibrin clots and promotes cleavage of IgG and C3 which also has a potent defensin-binding activity. It binds defensins with a stoichiometry of 1:6 and contributes to protection of bacteria *in vivo*. In the infected lung cathelicidin is present on airway epithelial surfaces prior to inflammation. It binds to staphylokinase and stimulates staphylokinase-promoted fibrinolysis. Thus *S. aureus* can utilize a host protease to promote bacterial dissemination and invasiveness.

Furthermore, the metalloprotease aureolysin cleaves and inactivates human defensin peptide cathelicidin LL-37 and contributes significantly to resistance to the peptide *in vitro.*

### Resistance to bactericidal proteins

Lysozyme and lactoferrin are important components of innate defences against bacterial infections. They are present in many body fluids. Lysozyme is expressed at enhanced levels in phagocytic cells that have been stimulated by proinflammatory signals during infection. The biochemical basis of the resistance of *S. aureus* peptidoglycan to lysozyme degradation was recently attributed to a membrane-bound O-acetyltransferase that modifies the C6 hydroxyl group of muramic acid. A mutant in the O-acetyltransferase became sensitive to lysozyme whereas complementation with the wild-type gene restored acetylation and lysozyme resistance. The surface protein LsdA binds lactoferrin and neutralizes its antibacterial serine protease activity thus protecting *S. aureus* from its bactericidal effects.

### Resistance to oxidative and nitrosative stress

*Staphylococcus aureus* has several mechanisms that contribute to its innate resistance to phagocytic killing, including interference with endosome fusion. It has several mechanisms to avoid the lethal effects of oxygen free radicals that are formed during the respiratory burst. It has been suggested that TLR-2 receptors on the membrane of the phagosome actually suppress expression of or activation of NADPH oxidase that results in reduced superoxide, but not nitrous oxide. Thus *S. aureus* has a novel mechanism for hijacking an innate immune receptor to support its survival within phagocytes. Evidence came from uptake and survival of bacteria in murine macrophages derived from TLR-2 knockout mice which killed bacteria more effectively than macrophages from wild-type mice.

The yellow carotenoid pigment of *S. aureus* helps to scavenge oxygen free radicals. A mutant defective in

synthesis of pigment was more susceptible to killing by neutrophils in vitro and was less virulent in a mouse subcutaneous abscess infection model. Neutrophils from a human chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) sufferer which have a defective respiratory burst had a reduced ability to kill S. aureus compared to those from a normal individual. There was no difference in survival of the pigment-deficient mutant in the CGD neutrophils.

Staphylococcus aureus expresses two superoxide dismutases that remove O₂⁻. Mutants defective in these enzymes have reduced virulence in a murine abscess model, indicating a role in combating oxidative stress in vivo. Manganese homeostasis is also an important defence against oxidative stress because of the cation's activity as a nonenzymatic superoxide dismutase. Reactive oxygen compounds can damage proteins by oxidizing the sulphur atom of methionine to methionine sulphoxide. S. aureus expresses three methionine sulphoxide reductases, one of which has been shown to be important for virulence in a mouse bacteraemia infection model indicating that it contributes to survival in vivo.

NO radicals are highly toxic to bacteria because of their ability to inactivate a variety of compounds including nonhaem and haem iron. S. aureus differs from S. epidermidis by expression of a NO-inducible lactate dehydrogenase (Ldh). An Ldh⁻ mutant had reduced virulence in mice which was partly restored in INOS⁻/⁻ knockouts. During aerobic respiration under nitrosative stress cytochromes are inactivated so potentially toxic reducing equivalents made from glucose oxidation must be eliminated by Ldh converting pyruvate to L-lactate.

Another function attributed to lsd proteins is resistance to H₂O₂ and phagocytic killing. It was suggested that this is in part due to lsd proteins reducing the availability of Fe²⁺ for generating oxygen intermediates (ROIs) within the neutrophil phagosome.

### Avoidance of phagocytosis

Staphylococcus aureus was once regarded as an exclusively extracellular pathogen but it is now abundantly evident that it can survive in neutrophils and macrophages as well as being able to invade and survive within nonprofessional phagocytes such as endothelial and epithelial cells. Uptake into nonprofessional phagocytes is promoted by the fibronectin binding protein forming a bridge with fibronectin to the α5β1 integrin on the host cell surface. Becoming intracellular allows S. aureus to escape host immunity until the cells are lysed by elaboration of membrane damaging toxins. Survival intracellularly is promoted by selection of slowly metabolizing so-called small colony variants that fail to express cytolytic toxins necessary to promote lysis from within.

Staphylococcus epidermidis is a less aggressive pathogen than S. aureus. It has come to prominence because of its ability to colonize implanted medical devices and to form biofilm. Like S. aureus it has a number of mechanisms that allow it to survive on human skin and mucous surfaces which also help protect it from host defences within the body. The dominant virulence mechanism of S. epidermidis is the ability to form biofilm, a multilayered dense structure that protects bacteria from antibiotics and the host immune system. S. aureus can also form biofilm by similar mechanisms to S. epidermidis. Biofilm formation is initiated when bacteria adhere to the biomaterial by surface-associated proteins such as the major autolysin AtlE or fibrinogen-binding proteins Fbe/SdrG in S. epidermidis or ClfA and fibronectin binding proteins in S. aureus. Cells in a typical multilayered biofilm are held together by the polysaccharide intercellular adhesion (PIA), a charged polymer comprising β-1,6-linked N-acetylglucosamine. PIA can also contribute directly to avoidance of innate immunity by promoting resistance to both cationic and noncationic antimicrobial peptides as well as reducing neutrophil uptake and killing.

Some clinical isolates of S. epidermidis from device-associated infections form biofilm in vitro but do not express PIA promoted by the accumulation-associated protein (Aap). The full length protein is cleaved by a protease to remove the N-terminal A domain and to expose the more distal repeated B region which promotes cell-cell binding presumably by homophilic protein-protein interactions.

A homologue of Aap expressed by S. aureus called SasG can also promote biofilm formation independently of PIA. The length of the SasG protein was crucial for biofilm formation – cells expressing SasG with fewer than 5 B repeats were biofilm negative. Like Aap, exposure of the B repeats of SasG on the cell surface by proteolytic removal of the A domain was necessary for biofilm formation.

Another PIA independent mechanism of biofilm formation by S. aureus occurs in MRSA isolates growing in glucose-containing growth media. This was shown to be due to expression of fibronectin binding proteins (FnBP). Dissection of FnBPA indicated that the N-terminal A domain was implicated in a mechanism that likely involves homophilic protein-protein interactions triggered by a reduction in pH.

S. epidermidis also expresses a poly-γ-DL-glutamic acid (PGA) surface macromolecule. PGA forms the capsule of Bacillus anthracis that is essential for virulence. A PGA-defective mutant of S. epidermidis grew poorly in NaCl compared to the parental strain indicating that PGA aids survival in high osmolyte environments such as on the surface of the skin. Expression of PGA did not influence the ability of S. epidermidis to form biofilm in vitro but did contribute to resistance to killing by antimicrobial peptides and resistance to opsonophagocytosis by human neutrophils.

### Immunomodulation

#### Protein A

Protein A is a potent immunomodulatory molecule because it can bind to the V₃ region adjacent to the antigen-binding domain of IgM molecules exposed on the surface of B lymphocytes. Cells bearing V₃ IgM are stimulated to proliferate and undergo apoptosis leading to depletion of a significant proportion of the repertoire of potential antibody secreting B cells in the spleen and bone marrow. The structural basis of the interaction is known. Helices II and III of the three helix bundle that

make up each domain of protein A provide the residues that contact IgM,²²,¹²⁹,¹³⁰ in contrast to the binding region for IgG, tumour necrosis factor receptor-1 and von Willebrand factor A1 domain which involve residues on the helix I-II face.¹³¹,¹³²

# Enterotoxins and TSST-1

*Staphylococcus aureus* secrets toxins that have superantigen activity when expressed systemically and cause an emetic response when ingested.¹³³ The superantigen activity is specified by a distinct domain of the protein from that which determines the emetic response. Some strains also express the nonemetic superantigenic toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1) which was first associated with toxic shock syndrome cases caused by usage of super-absorbent tampons.¹³⁴ Superantigens bind to the exterior surface of the MHC class II protein on the surface of antigen-presenting cells and link it to the T-cell receptor on the surface of T helper cells.¹³⁵–¹³⁷ Binding occurs without the requirement of an antigenic peptide to be presented by MHC II to a suitable T-cell receptor. Each type of enterotoxin recognizes a specific subset of variable Vβ chains of T-cell receptors and therefore has a characteristic Vβ signature.¹³⁸ Also there are different binding site specificities on the MHC class II protein family.¹³⁹ Up to 30% of T cells can become activated in extreme cases leading to activation, proliferation and expression of high levels of cytokines causing TSS.¹³⁴,¹³⁶

Expression of superantigens during infection also prevents development of a normal immune response.¹³⁶ Antigen-specific T cells fail to proliferate in response to antigens that are presented normally by MHC class II leading to a phenomenon called anergy.¹⁴⁰ This causes immunosuppression due to failure to induce an appropriate immune response and a lack of immunological memory. This prevents development of antibodies to the superantigen toxins themselves. Lack of antibody to superantigens is a common characteristic of TSS patients.¹³⁴

The MHC class II-analogue protein Map (also called Eap, see above) comprises six repeated domains of 110 residues, each containing a 30 residue motif with strong homology to the peptide-binding groove of the MHC class II β-chain.¹⁴¹,¹⁴² Map can bind to the T-cell receptor on T cells resulting in an alteration of T-cell function, causing a reduction in T-cell proliferation. It also causes a shift from a Th1 response to a Th2 response which affects cell-mediated immunity and might explain the more rapid clearance of a Map-deficient mutant compared to the wild-type strain from internal abscesses in infected mice. Map also showed two different effects on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PMBCs).¹⁴³ At low concentrations it stimulates proliferation of PMBCs but at high concentrations it inhibits the proliferative effect of the superantigen TSST-1 and stimulates apoptosis of B and T cells. The receptors recognized by Map in causing these effects are not known.

# In vivo regulation of anti-phagocytic virulence factors

*Staphylococcus aureus* has a two component signal transduction system (HssRS) that can sense the concentration of haem. When haem is present a nearby operon is induced which encodes an ATP-binding cassette efflux pump called the haem-regulated transport system HtrAB.¹⁴⁴ This pumps surplus cytoplasmic haem from the cells which has been transported in by the Fur-regulated Isd haem-uptake system. When injected intravenously in mice both HtrA- and HssR-defective mutants of strain Newman were hypervirulent with increased bacterial loads occurring in the liver. The mutant bacteria growing in iron-restricted medium that mimics *in vivo* growth conditions expressed higher levels of several secreted proteins that are involved in immune evasion including SSL5, Map-W, Efb, FLIPr and Eap. There were reduced numbers of phagocytic cells in the infected tissue which could have been due to reduced influx, increased destruction or both. It is proposed that increased intracellular Fe³⁺ induces stress responses that lead to up-regulation of genes encoding secreted virulence factors.

## Subversion of the humoral immune response

*Staphylococcus aureus* can bind to resting platelets and stimulate their activation. Platelet activation and subsequent aggregation is important in the pathogenesis of endovascular infections leading to infective endocarditis (IE).¹⁴⁵,¹⁴⁶ *S. aureus* is now the leading cause of IE. Bacteria grow in platelet fibrin thrombi where they escape the attention of neutrophils. The fibronectin-binding proteins are the major surface proteins causing platelet activation on bacterial cells in exponential growth, and ClfA is the dominant surface component on the surface of cells from the stationary phase of growth.⁶⁴,¹⁴⁷,¹⁴⁸ In both cases contact with resting platelets is made through a bridge to the nascent low affinity GPIIb/IIIa integrin provided by fibrinogen or fibronectin. For activation to occur the binding of antibodies specific to the surface protein is required. Bound IgG engages the FcγRIIa receptor on the platelet surface. This causes clustering of Fc receptors and stimulation of intracellular signalling leading to activation and aggregation. Almost all individuals have low levels of antibodies to surface proteins of *S. aureus* sufficient to trigger platelet activation and disease pathogenesis. Thus *S. aureus* exploits the humoral response to previous exposures to the organism in order to promote disease pathogenesis.

## Concluding remarks

*Staphylococcus aureus* has a multiplicity of mechanisms to thwart innate and induced immunity. It is particularly instructive to compare *S. aureus* with its close relative *S. epidermidis* which essentially relies on surface polymers and its ability to form biofilm to survive in the host. This is likely to be a reflection of the different sites in the human body where the organisms reside in the commensal state.³ *Staphylococcus epidermidis* is a commensal of the human skin whereas for *S. aureus* the primary habitat is the moist squamous epithelium of the anterior nares where it encounters both innate and induced immunity.
*Staphylococcus pseudintermedius*, which was previously called *S. intermedius*, is associated specifically with

the canine host. It seems to resemble *S. aureus* more than *S. epidermidis*. Many of the virulence factors of *S. aureus* have been described in *S. pseudintermedius*. It can secrete α-, β- and γ-haemolysins, a protease, coagulase, enterotoxin and exfoliative toxin. It is likely to express several surface proteins with homology to those of *S. aureus*. *S. pseudintermedius* strains can adhere to immobilized fibrinogen, fibronectin and cytokeratin 10, properties endowed by clumping factors and fibronectin binding proteins of *S. aureus* and a 180 kDa fibrinogen binding related to ClfB and 130 kDa fibronectin binding protein been identified in cell wall extracts. *S. pseudintermedius* also expresses a IgG binding protein related to protein A of *S. aureus.*

The most effective way of determining the full extent of virulence factors of *S. pseudintermedius*, including homologues of the diverse immune evasion factors described above, is to obtain the genomic DNA sequence of at least one strain isolated from a case of canine pyoderma. Bioinformatic analysis of open reading frames will identify putative virulence factors. Genes can be cloned by PCR and recombinant proteins expressed. Development of a genetic system in *S. pseudintermedius* to allow transfer of plasmids and construction of chromosomal mutants by allele replacement will enable isogenic mutants to be compared in *in vitro* and *in vivo* models. This will facilitate design of vaccines to combat the infection.

**Résumé** L’épithélium squameux humide des narines antérieures est l’habitat naturel de *Staphylococcus aureus* chez l’homme. Plusieurs protéines de surface bactériennes sont impliquées dans l’adhésion aux cellules épithéliales desquamantes. Le clumping factor B (ClfB) et le régulateur de surface déterminant A permettent tous deux la colonisation nasale chez les rongeurs. Il s’agit chez l’homme du ClfB. Un des ligands impliqués dans l’adhésion est la cytokératine 10. La diminution de la colonisation nasale est permise par une immunité active et passive. *S. aureus* est doté de composants sécrétés et de surface qui compromettent les réponses immunitaires innées, en particulier l’action des neutrophiles. *S. aureus* sécrète des protéines qui diminuent la migration des neutrophiles du flux sanguin jusqu’au site d’infection en entravant la diapédèse et les récepteurs des molécules chimiotactiques. Plusieurs protéines sécrétées interfèrent avec les convertases C3 et C5 du complément réduisant ainsi le taux d’opsonine C3b et de peptide chimiotactique C5a. Les protéases de l’hôte sont recrutées à la surface cellulaire pour améliorer la destruction d’IgG et de C3b opsonisant. Le composant de surface ClfA, la protéine A et les polysaccharides de capsule compromettent la reconnaissance des opsonines de la surface cellulaire bactérienne. Si les bactéries sont internalisées par les neutrophiles, elles peuvent résister activement grâce à des composants oxygénés intermédiaires, des radicaux d’oxyde nitrique, des défensines et des protéines bactériennes. Une primo-infection par *S. aureus* n’induit pas une protection immunitaire complète. Ceci peut être lié à une immunosuppression due à l’expression de superantigènes qui perturbent l’activation normale des cellules T et B au cours de la présentation antigénique. L’étude de la pathogénie moléculaire de l’infection à *S. aureus* pourrait permettre de mieux comprendre les infections à *S. pseudintermedius* chez le chien.

**Resumen** El hábitat natural de *Staphylococcus aureus* en humanos es el epitelio escamoso húmedo de la parte anterior de los orificios nasales. Varias proteínas de superficie bacterianas están implicadas en promover la adhesión a las células epiteliales descamadas. El factor de agregación B (ClfB) y el determinante superficial de hierro A promueven la colonización nasal en modelos de ratón, y en el caso de ClfB, también en humanos. Uno de los ligandos implicados en la adhesión es la citoqueratina 10. La reducción en la colonización nasal puede obtenerse mediante inmunización activa y pasiva. *S. aureus* está bien provisto de componentes secretados y superficiales que comprometen las respuestas inmunes innatas, particularmente la función de neutrófilos. *S. aureus* secreta proteínas que reducen la migración de neutrófilos de la sangre al lugar de infección al impedir la diapedesis y los receptores para la moléculas quimiotácticas. Varias proteínas secretadas interfieren con las convertasas de los factores de complemento C3 y C5, reduciendo así el nivel de opsonina C3b y del péptido quimiotáctico C5a. Las proteasas del hospedador son reclutadas a la superficie celular para incrementar la destrucción de la C3b y de IgA opsónicas. Los componentes superficiales ClfA, proteína A y el polisacárido de la cápsula comprometen el reconocimiento de opsoninas en la superficie bacteriana. Si se engloban por los neutrófilos, la bacteria intracelular puede resistir los intermediarios de oxígeno reactivo, los radicales de óxido nítrico, las defensinas y las proteínas bactericidas. Una infección anterior con *S. aureus* no induce una inmunidad protectora completa. Esto puede ser debido a inmunosupresión causada por la expresión de proteínas superantigénicas que alteran la activación normal de linfocitos T y B durante la presentación antigénica. Estudiando la patogenia molecular de las infecciones por *S. aureus* se podrían encontrar marcadores para investigar las infecciones por *S. pseudintermedius* en perros.

**Zusammenfassung** Der natürliche Lebensraum von *Staphylokokkus aureus* beim Menschen ist das feuchte squamöse Epithel der vorderen Nares. Mehrere bakterielle Oberflächenproteine werden damit in Zusammenhang gebracht, die Adhäsion an die desquamierten Epithelzellen zu begünstigen. Der Clumping Faktor B (ClfB) und das Eisen-regulierte Oberflächenprotein A begünstigen beide die nasale Kolonisation in Nagerrmodellen und im Falle von ClfB, beim Menschen. Einer der bei der Adhäsion involvierten Liganden ist das Cytokeratin 10. Eine Reduzierung der nasalen Kolonisation kann durch aktive und passive Immunisierung erreicht werden. *S. aureus* ist gut mit sezernierten und Oberflächenkomponenten ausgestattet, die angeborene Immunantworten, vor allem die Funktion der Neutrophilen, gefährden. *S. aureus* sezerniert Proteine, die die Migration der Neutrophilen vom Blutstrom an die Stelle der Infektion vermindern, indem sie die Diapedese und die Rezeptoren für die chemotaktischen Moleküle hemmen. Mehrere sezernierte Proteine beeinträchtigen Komplement C3 und die C5 Konvertasen und reduzieren somit das Level von C3b Opsonin und die chemotaktischen Peptide C5a. Proteasen des Wirtes werden an die Zelloberfläche rekrutiert, um die Zerstörung von C3b und IgG zu unterstützen. Die Oberflächenkomponenten ClfA, Protein A und die Polysaccharidkapsel beeinträchtigen die Erkennung von Opsoninen an der bakteriellen

Zelloberfläche. Wenn es von Neutrophilen eingeschlossen wird, kann das intrazelluläre Bakterium reaktiven Sauerstoff Intermediaten, Stickstoffradikalen, Defensin-Proteinen und bakteriziden Proteinen Widerstand leisten. Eine vorhergegangene Infektion mit *S. aureus* induziert keine vollständige schützende Immunität. Das könnte aufgrund einer Immunsuppression passieren, die durch die Expression von Superantigen-Proteinen, die die normale Aktivierung von T-Zellen und B-Zellen während der Antigenpräsentation stören, verursacht wird. Durch Studien der molekularen Ebene der *S. aureus* Infektionen könnten Marker gefunden werden, um *S. pseudintermedius* Infektionen der Hunde zu untersuchen.
