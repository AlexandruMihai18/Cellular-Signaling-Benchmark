#### Abstract

The ability to store energy in the form of energy-dense triacylglycerol and to mobilize these stores rapidly during periods of low carbohydrate availability or throughout the strong metabolic demand is a highly conserved process, absolutely essential for survival. In the industrialized world the regulation of this pathway is viewed as an important therapeutic target for disease prevention. Adipose tissue lipolysis is a catabolic process leading to the breakdown of triacylglycerols stored in fat cells, and release of fatty acids and glycerol. Mobilization of adipose tissue fat is mediated by the MGL, HSL and ATGL, similarly functioning enzymes. ATGL initiates lipolysis followed by the actions of HSL on diacylglycerol, and MGL on monoacylglycerol. HSL is regulated by reversible phosphorylation on five critical residues. Phosphorylation alone, however, is not enough to activate HSL. Probably, conformational alterations and a translocation from the cytoplasm to lipid droplets are also involved. In accordance, Perilipin functions as a master regulator of lipolysis, protecting or exposing the triacylglycerol core of a lipid droplet to lipases. The prototype processes of hormonal lipolytic control are the β-adrenergic stimulation and suppression by insulin, both of which affect cytoplasmic cyclic AMP levels. Lipolysis in adipocytes is an important process in the management of body energy reserves. Its deregulation may contribute to the symptoms of type 2 diabetes mellitus and other pathological situations. We, herein, discuss the metabolic regulation and function of lipases mediating mammalian lipolysis with a focus on HSL, quoting newly identified members of the lipolytic proteome.

### 1. Introduction

Obesity has become worldwide a serious health problem as a consequence of excessive high-calorie uptake, high-fat diets and the adoption of a sedentary lifestyle. Moreover, the exponential increase of obesity rates has led to a more focalized study on the metabolism and process of fat accumulation. It is basically determined by the balance between two complex metabolic functions; lipogenesis, thus fatty acid synthesis, and lipolysis, a triacylglycerol hydrolysis. Several studies have been conducted in many Eutherian species (including human/animals), investigating aspects and factors able to influence or control lipolysis, such as diet, hormones, stress, age and breeding. The advent of new technologies at molecular level has identified many genes implicated in the complex process of lipolysis, providing new insights into understanding its function and offering the possibility to explore new pathways of lipid metabolism.

During periods of nutrient deprivation and/or stress, lipolysis is carried out by adipocytes, in which non-esterified fatty acids (NEFAs) and glycerol are released from the triacylglycerol storage droplets and secreted from the cell. NEFAs are immediately liberated into the bloodstream, where they provide energy for muscle tissue, and are taken up by the liver and oxidized, esterified, or converted into ketone bodies. In the non-ruminant species, the rate-limiting step of lipolysis is the initial cleavage of triacylglycerols, resulting in their complete hydrolysis to free fatty acids and glycerol. It is thought that lipolysis in ruminants occurs in a similar manner (Vernon, 1980). Being an essential process for the regulation of energy homeostasis, lipolysis is implemented by at least three specific enzymes. A Monoglyceride Lipase (MGL) catalyzes the breakdown of monoacylglycerol (MAG) to glycerol and fatty acids, whereas a Hormone-Sensitive Lipase, so-called HSL, mediates for the hydrolysis of triacylglycerol (TAG) to diacylglycerol (DAG) and diacylglycerol to monoacylglycerol (MAG) (Holm, 2003).

One molecule of TAG is broken down, in a stepwise fashion via DAG and MAG intermediates, into three molecules of free fatty acids and one molecule of glycerol (Fig. 1). In vitro, HSL, via interaction with the cytosolic lipid-binding protein Fatty Acid Binding Protein 4 (FABP4), also known as ALBP and aP2, catalyzes the hydrolysis of TAG into DAG and DAG into MAG, as mentioned above. The relative fatty acid hydrolase activity of HSL in vitro is 10-fold higher against DAG than TAG. This in vitro data was indicative that HSL might be more important as a DAG than TAG hydrolase (Stralfors et al., 1987; Lass et al., 2011). The enzyme is also responsible for the hydrolysis of cholesterol and retinyl esters (Lombardo et al., 1980). Although HSL has the capacity to hydrolyze monoacylglycerol in vitro, Monoacyl-

glycerol Lipase (MGL) is required to obtain complete hydrolysis of monoacylglycerols in vivo (Fredrikson et al., 1986).

Furthermore, a novel lipase termed Adipose Triacylglycerol Lipase (ATGL), alternatively denoted as either Desnutrin or iPLA2, has been recently identified (Jenkins et al., 2004; Villena et al., 2004; Zimmermann et al., 2004). This lipase belongs to a family of proteins containing a Patatin-like domain. It is a lipid hydrolase with an unusual folded topology that significantly differs from classical lipases. Using antibodies directed against ATGL, Zimmermann et al. (2004) revealed that ATGL is responsible for the 75% of total cytosolic acylhydrolase activity in white adipose tissue (WAT) of HSL deficient mice. ATGL could, therefore, participate together with HSL, in a likely cooperative fashion, for the efficient implementation of WAT lipolytic process. Using a highly specific HSL inhibitor, the relative contribution of HSL and ATGL respective lipolytic activities has been recently re-evaluated (Langin et al., 2005).

ATGL is highly expressed in adipose tissue and its expression markedly increases during adipocyte differentiation. Overexpression of ATGL in a mouse fat cell line stimulated basal and catecholamine-induced lipolysis. Knockdown of ATGL in 3T3-L1 adipocytes resulted in a decrease of glycerol and fatty acid release (Kershaw et al., 2006). ATGL deficiency causes a potent reduction (more than 75%) of fatty acid release by white fat cells in mice and a significant TAG accumulation. As a consequence, ATGL deficient mice rapidly become obese (Haemmerle et al., 2006). Comparative Gene Identification-58 (CGI-58), or Alpha/Beta-Hydrolase Domain-containing Protein 5 (ABHD5), is the key regulator for the lipolytic action of ATGL. CGI-58 stimulates TAG hydrolase activity in wild-type and HSL-deficient WAT but not in ATGL-deficient WAT, suggesting that ATGL is the sole target for CGI-58-mediated activation of adipose lipolysis (Fig. 2) (Lass et al., 2006; Schweiger et al., 2006). Nevertheless, ATGL and HSL together, are responsible for more than 95% of the TAG hydrolase activity present in murine WAT.

A recent study in a human adipocyte model (differentiated hMADS adipocytes) has provided valuable mechanistic information on the respective roles of ATGL and HSL in lipolysis regulation. Translocation of ATGL from cytosol to smaller lipid droplets was observed and this translocation increased ATGL colocalization dynamics with HSL under stimulated conditions (Bezaire et al., 2009). HSL or ATGL over-expression resulted in the increased triacylglycerol-specific hydrolase activity, but only ATGL overexpression could enhance whole cell lipolysis. ATGL is an important component in the dispensation of DAG to HSL in basal and stimulated conditions despite HSL's own capacity to cleave the first ester bond (Bezaire et al., 2009). HSL is indispensable for complete lipolysis, as demonstrated in human differentiated pre-

Fig. 2. A proposed model for the molecular mechanisms regulating lipolysis. Under basal conditions, non-activated Perilipin coats the surface of a single triacylglycerol (TAG) lipid droplet and binds to the Comparative Gene Identification-58 [(CGI-58), also known as α/β-Hydrolase Domain-Containing Protein 5 (ABHD5)], a key co-activator of ATGL enzyme. Moreover, in this resting (unstimulated) condition, HSL is dispersed in the cytoplasm. Regulators like catecholamines promote cAMP production, while cAMP activates PKA, leading to phosphorylation of both Perilipin and HSL. Upon lipolytic stimulation, Perilipin phosphorylation induces physical alterations of the lipid droplet surface, which facilitate the action of phosphorylated HSL on TAG hydrolysis. Phosphorylation of Perilipin also promotes CGI-58 release, which, in its “free” form, binds to ATGL and activates TAG hydrolytic function of the enzyme, thus resulting in DAG production. HSL and MGL contribute to the final hydrolysis of DAG and MAG. Concomitant enhancement of ATGL, HSL and MGL activities is absolutely necessary for the complete hydrolysis of TAG and the release of non-esterified fatty acids (NEFAs) and glycerol. There is also evidence that fatty acids are removed from HSL by FABP4, preventing product accumulation and subsequent product-mediated enzymatic inhibition.

adipocytes (Ryden et al., 2007). Therefore, Lafontan and Langin (2009) have proposed that the increased number of ATGL-CGI-58 complexes, formed following Perilipin A phosphorylation and docked on small lipid droplets, tightly govern PKA-stimulated lipolysis. Overall, it is the sequential effect of ATGL-accentuated TAG hydrolysis, phosphorylated HSL and MGL action, which yields a massive upregulation of NEFA release in response to PKA activation (Fig. 2).

In toto, ATGL and HSL enzymes possess strong capacities to efficiently hydrolyze triacylglycerol moieties *in vitro*. The important role of ATGL in lipolysis became evident when parameters of lipid and energy metabolism were analyzed in ATGL deficient mice (Haemmerle et al., 2006) and is now considered to be the major TAG lipase in adipose tissue. ATGL exhibits 10-fold higher substrate specificity for TAG than for DAG and selectively performs the first step in TAG hydrolysis, resulting in the formation of DAG and FA (Zimmermann et al., 2004; Zechner et al., 2009). Current models for TAG lipolysis from adipose tissue have suggested that ATGL may specifically remove the first fatty acid from the TAG molecules generating DAGs, which are the preferred substrates of HSL (Yeaman et al., 1994; Zimmermann et al., 2009). Being the rate-limiting enzyme in the cellular catabolism of DAG in adipose tissue, the relative rate of acylglycerol hydrolysis by HSL is 1:10:5 regarding TAG, DAG and MAG, respectively. An important unique feature of HSL, in comparison with other lipolytic enzymes, is its capacity to hydrolyze DAGs much faster than TAGs (Rodriguez et al., 2010), and is, therefore, the main focus of the present Review article.

2. The fundamental role of Hormone-Sensitive Lipase (HSL) in lipid metabolism

As stated before, HSL is a key enzyme in the regulation of the most essential energy source; the lipids. Evidence for the physiological importance of HSL is based on its properties that it is an intracellular neutral lipase being highly expressed in adipose tissue and is also able to catalyze the first two steps (dominating in the second step) in the breakdown of stored TAGs; i.e., the hydrolysis of triacylglycerol and diacylglycerol. HSL, however, bears broader substrate specificity and tissue distribution, being able to catalyze the hydrolysis of 1(3)-monoacylglycerol (Fredrikson et al., 1981) and mediate the hydrolysis of stored cholesteryl esters in steroidogenic tissues (Cook et al., 1982). Furthermore, HSL catalyzes the hydrolysis of other lipid substrates, such as lipoidal esters of steroid hormones (Lee et al., 1988) and retinyl esters in adipose tissue (Wei et al., 1997), as well as water-soluble butyrate substrates (Holm and Osterlund, 1999).

As one could expect from its complicated role, HSL is not only present in adipose tissues but can be also detected at low levels in a variety of other tissues, including heart (Small et al., 1989), skeletal muscle (Langfort et al., 1998), macrophages (Contreras et al., 1994; Jepson and Yeaman, 1993) and pancreatic β-cells (Klannemark et al., 1998). In addition, HSL is expressed in a diversity of cell lines, like Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells (Osuga et al., 1997), intestinal mucosa cells, as a cholesterol esterase of the intestinal mucosa (Grober et al., 2003), and human bladder cancer cells (Lampidonis et al., 2008b). According to Sekiya et al. (2008), HSL is, also, expressed in hepatocytes and significantly contributes to hepatic cholesterol ester hydrolase activity. Particularly, the expression of HSL was detected in parenchymal as well as in non-parenchymal cell populations, which mainly contain Kupffer cells (the resident macrophages in liver), while it proved to be expressed in the H2.35 and McARH7777 murine hepatocyte cell lines. The enzyme forms aggregates at high concentrations, requires the presence of detergents for purification and binds to phospholipid vesicles, properties suggestive of a hydrophobic protein profile (Holm et al., 1990).

3. Structure of Hormone-Sensitive Lipase (HSL) gene and protein

3.1. Gene structure

As HSL has been extensively studied in human and other mammalian species, complete and annotated gene sequences have been already deciphered for human (Holm et al., 1988a; Holst et al., 1996; Langin et al., 1993), mouse (Li et al., 1994; Sztrolovics et al., 1997), rat (Fredrikson et al., 1981; Osterlund et al., 1996), pig (Harbitz et al., 1999) and bovine (Cordle et al., 1986; Garton et al., 1988) species. Ovine HSL (ovHSL) has been analytically studied at enzymatic level in adipose tissue (Bauchart, 1993; Chilliard et al., 2000; Khachadurian et al., 1966; Rogdakis et al., 1997; Vernon, 1980; Vernon and Finley, 1985), whereas an integrated approach at a molecular level regarding the cloning and isolation protocols of the ovHSL full-length cDNAs has been recently performed by Lampidonis et al. (2008a).

Holm et al. (1988a) have mapped the human HSL (hHSL) gene onto chromosome 19 (42,905,659 - 42,931,578), whereas, as it has been demonstrated by Warden et al. (1993), the mouse homologue is localized onto chromosome 7 (26,164,546 - 26,181,006). Moreover, the HSL gene in pig has been mapped onto chromosome 6 (34,152,191 - 34,162,930) by Gu et al. (1992), while regarding cattle HSL gene, it is detected onto chromosome 18 (50,637,393 - 50,657,593) (Cordle et al., 1986; Yonezawa et al., 2008). According to our knowledge, no information concerning the ovHSL chromosomal topology has been reported so far (Lampidonis et al., 2008a).

The gene for human HSL (LIPE) spans a genomic region of 26 Kb, whereas a 10.4 Kb segment, comprised by 9 exons that are interrupted by 8 introns, represents the mouse HSL gene. The rat HSL gene encodes a 786 amino acid polypeptide (Holm et al., 1988b; Langin et al., 1993), which reveals no membrane spanning region, suggesting a property of free protein not attached to a membrane (Holm et al., 1988a). The human HSL protein is slightly larger compared to the rat homologue, and is characterized by 12 amino acid deletion (Langin et al., 1993). Exon 6 contains the catalytic site serine motif identified in almost all lipases (GXSXG). This critical serine is thought to be a part of a catalytic triad observed in many lipases, together with Asp-703 and His-733 residues (Contreras et al., 1996). Exon 8 contains the two serine phosphorylation sites, while exon 9 carries a putative lipid-binding region, as it encodes a hydrophobic stretch (Holm et al., 1994).

In addition to the 10 exons that are transcribed into HSL mRNAs in all human and mouse tissues, alternative exon usage results in a significant variation in the 5′-region of HSL transcripts (Blaise et al., 1999; Blaise et al., 2001; Grober et al., 1997; Langin et al., 1993). In adipose tissue, adrenal gland and ovary, HSL transcription starts from multiple exons (exons A, B, C and D, or exon 1) within a 13 Kb region. Since exons B, C, and D are non-coding, the alternative exon usage does not change the amino acid composition of the enzyme. In contrast, exon A contains coding information for 43 additional amino acids, leading to an alternative enzyme isoform. In testis, two tissue-specific exons (T1 and T2) contain two transcriptional start sites, respectively. Exon T1 also codes for an additional 300 amino acid region, whereas T2 represents a non-coding sequence. The high variability in exon usage results in various HSL mRNA and protein sizes in adipose tissue, pancreatic β-cells, ovary and testis. Multiple putative transcription factor binding elements, upstream of each transcriptional start site, strongly support the scenario of differential transcriptional regulation of HSL gene in different tissues and under various physiological conditions.

In order to verify the proposed porcine HSL gene structure, a genomic clone carrying the HSL gene of 11 Kb was isolated by Harbitz et al. (1999). Exons in the sequenced region of 9 Kb were determined by comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence with the corresponding rat and human protein sequences, taking into account the GT/AG rule for exon/intron junctions and the typical splice junctions sequences. The porcine HSL gene comprises 9 exons that are interrupted by 8 introns, thus encoding a 763 amino acid polypeptide.

Contrary to the bovine HSL gene that encodes a 756 amino acid polypeptide (Yonezawa et al., 2008), the putative ovine Hormone-Sensitive Lipase (ovHSL) protein, being considerably shorter, is represented by two isoforms of 695 and 694 amino acids, respectively, and bears strong homologies with other HSL protein family members, as recently reported by Lampidonis et al. (2008a). The ovHSL full-length cDNA clones were isolated with the aid of highly conserved regions of sequence identities among the published human, mouse, rat, pig and bovine sequences, using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based strategy. The two isolated isoforms ovHSL-A and ovHSL-B contain two highly homologous open reading frame (ORF) regions of 2.089 Kb and 2.086 Kb, respectively (Fig. 3A). Multiple nucleotide sequence alignments with full-length cDNAs originated from different mammalian family members revealed strong identities within previously characterized areas.

Referring to the transcriptional regulation of HSL gene and according to the current literature and in silico analysis, a typical “TATA-box”, as the essential cis-element of basic transcription, could hardly be

(A) The two ovHSL-A and ovHSL-B isoforms contain two highly homologous open reading frames (ORFs) of 2.089 Kb and 2.086 Kb, respectively.

recognized within the putative HSL 5′-regulatory region (proximal promoter). A similar organization pattern bearing equivalent structural features has been previously reported for the human HSL promoter ([Grober et al., 1997](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0304-419X(97)00286-8)). On the contrary, in the mouse HSL promoter, an AT-rich “TTTAT” sequence was identified and entitled as a “non-canonical TATA-box” ([Laurin et al., 2000](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0304-419X(00)00215-2); [Sztrolovics et al., 1997](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0304-419X(97)00286-8)). This finding was similar to the one observed in the porcine HSL promoter, in which two “TATA-like” sequences and a reverse “CCAAT-box” were recognized at the appropriate and expected positions ([Harbitz et al., 1999](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0304-419X(99)00215-2)). Moreover, regarding the proximal part of the ovine HSL regulatory region, [Lampidonis et al. (2008b)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2008.02.012) demonstrated that it represents a “TATA-less” promoter area, harboring several cis-regulatory elements that could be putatively recognized by relatively more general transcription factors, including Stimulating Protein 1 (Sp1), “CCAAT-box” Binding Factors (CBFs) and other trans-acting proteins.

It has been previously proved that several gene promoters are missing the classical “TATA-box” and, thus, are in general, recognized as “TATA-less” ([Ogbourne and Antalis, 1998](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0304-419X(98)00215-2)). Although the transcriptional regulation process of these genes remains enigmatic, the interactions and “cross-talks” between initiator elements, functional “TATA-box analogues” and versatile transcription factors, including Sp1, may play important roles in gene expression ([Smale and Baltimore, 1989](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0304-419X(89)00215-2); [Smale, 1997](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0304-419X(97)00215-2)). We do believe that the extensive cis-and trans-molecular analysis of all the putatively identified motifs in the HSL promoters will prove extremely valuable towards deciphering the transcriptional control code of genes implicated in mammalian lipolysis.

### 3.2. Protein organization and structure

Structure analysis by tryptic digestion indicates that HSL consists of separately folded domains with short, protease-sensitive, amino acid sequences in-between. This analysis revealed a domain of approximately 18 kDa, which retained its activity against the water-soluble P-Nitrophenyl Butyrate (PNPB), but lost its function against lipid substrates ([Tsujita et al., 1989](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0304-419X(89)00215-2)). This domain is located between 333 and 499 residue of the rat HSL sequence and contains the active site of critical serine. In addition, it is characterized by the GXSXG motif placed between 421 and 425 amino acid residue of the rat HSL sequence, which is highly conserved in almost all lipases. Therefore, this domain must, more likely, represent the catalytic core of HSL protein. [Holm et al. (1994)](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0304-419X(94)00215-2) have shown that the substitution of Ser-423 led to the complete ablation of esterase and lipase activity. Mutation of the other serine residues present in HSL had no effect. A three-dimensional model of the catalytic domain has been built by [Contreras et al. (1996)](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0304-419X(96)00215-2). It consists of various α-helices and β-sheets folded in a so-called α/β hydrolase fold, a centrally oriented β-sheet surrounded by a variable number of α-helices. However, two large differences with homologous enzymes were observed. One is the connection between β7 and β8 and the other is the connection between β6 and β7. The latter has a major insert containing the phosphorylation sites.

Most lipases exhibit an increase in activity in the presence of a lipid-water interface. Analysis by crystallography proved that in these lipases the catalytic triad is buried deeply inside the enzyme. On binding to the lipid interface the lid opens and exposes the active site, thereby enlarging the non-polar surface and burying the polar residues. [Yeaman et al. (1994)](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0304-419X(94)00215-2) have demonstrated that this might also be true for HSL, as the addition of phospholipid vesicles increased the HSL-catalyzed hydrolysis of PNPB. Trypsin-treated HSL does not show an enhanced activity against PNPB in the presence of a lipid-water interface, suggesting that HSL carries a lipid-binding domain that is susceptible to proteolytic digestion. The helix-loop-helix that constitutes the lid in many lipases is situated directly in front of β2. In HSL, however, the connecting loop between β2-sheet and the α-helix, in front of it, is too short to allow the helix to cover the catalytic site.

This indicates that this region is not a functional lid in HSL ([Contreras et al., 1996](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0304-419X(96)00215-2)).

HSL protein contains two phosphorylation sites, termed site 1 and site 2 (respective residues 563 and 565 of rat HSL). Tryptic digestion of HSL that was phosphorylated with ³²P at site 1 revealed an, approximately, 11.5 kDa domain, which contained both phosphorylation sites ([Smith et al., 1996](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0304-419X(96)00215-2)). This fragment is thought to behave as the regulatory domain and is located at an approximate position of 499 to 653 residue of the rat HSL sequence. Digestion of HSL labeled at site 2, however, did not generate a phosphorylated domain. The label was recovered in a small phosphopeptide, thus suggesting that phosphorylation at site 2 induces a conformational change rendering the regulatory domain susceptible to proteolysis ([Smith et al., 1996](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0304-419X(96)00215-2)). When HSL is digested with low concentrations of trypsin, resulting in a loss of HSL activity against lipids an, approximately, 11 kDa polypeptide can be detected. Its amino-terminal fragment corresponds to residue 658 and probably runs, consistently with its 11 kDa mass, to the carboxyl-end of the HSL protein, at residue 768. Furthermore, contributing to its possible role as a lipid-binding region, it contains a hydrophobic area from 735 to 742 residue (FLSLAALC), which could function as a putative lipid-binding site ([Smith et al., 1996](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0304-419X(96)00215-2)).

In toto, taking into account the total mass of 84 kDa, the last region to be distinguished is the 35 kDa amino-terminal area. Its role remains to be elucidated, but a possible property could be the regulatory interaction with other proteins, like Perilipin.

To summarize, according to the HSL domain structure model [despite the severe limitations of protein structure availability, deposited in Public Data Banks], the three-dimensional molecular configuration of the ovine HSL catalytic domain was constrainedly predicated by [Lampidonis et al. (2008a)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2008.02.012) ([Fig. 3](#fig:3) B)], the enzyme can be subdivided into three to four functional regions ([Holm et al., 1994](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0304-419X(94)00215-2); [Osterlund et al., 1996](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0304-419X(96)00215-2); [Osterlund et al., 1997](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0304-419X(97)00215-2); [Osterlund et al., 1999](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0304-419X(99)00215-2)). The amino-terminal domain (amino acids 1–300) is thought to mediate enzyme dimerization ([Shen et al., 2000](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0304-419X(00)00215-2)) and interaction with FABP4, a Fatty Acid Binding Protein known to enhance HSL enzymatic activity ([Smith et al., 2007](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0304-419X(07)00215-2)). The carboxyl-terminal domain contains the catalytic triad composed of Ser-423, Asp-703 and His-733 (the numbering refers to rat HSL, isoform 2), within an α/β hydrolase fold typically observed in numerous lipases and esterases, and in a wide range of hydrolytic enzymes being characterized by different catalytic functions and phylogenetic origins ([Ollis et al., 1992](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0304-419X(92)00215-2)). The third domain represents the regulatory module of the enzyme. This loop region (amino acids 521–669 of rat HSL) contains all the known phosphorylation sites of HSL. Finally, a putative lipid-binding domain can be positioned at the last residue area of 658 to the end of the protein. Parts of the catalytic triad, however, are located in this last region, arguing against its role in lipid-binding, since with limited tryptic digestion lipid-binding is lost but catalytic activity is retained. Therefore, the amino-terminal domain might be critically implicated in lipid interaction, as previously suggested by [Osterlund et al. (1996)](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0304-419X(96)00215-2).

It should be noted that human HSL is larger than that of rat (88 kDa and 84 kDa, respectively), mouse (82 kDa), guinea-pig (82 kDa) ([Holm et al., 1989](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0304-419X(89)00215-2) and sheep (76 kDa), as well ([Lampidonis et al., 2008a](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2008.02.012)). This indicates the presence of serious differences among the structure of various HSL family members. The regulation of human HSL, however, appears to be analogous to that of rat HSL, suggesting that the general structure and function are conserved ([Khoo et al., 1974](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0304-419X(74)00215-2)).

Ovine (Ovis aries {Ovis A}: DQ647325); bovine (Bos indicus: NM_001080220); human (Homo sapiens: NM_005357); mouse (Mus musculus: NM_001039507); rat (Rattus norvegicus: NM_012859); and pig (Sus scrofa: NM_214315).

Sensitive Lipase, defining of for a protein of 763 residues, as mentioned above, is approximately 85%–86% identical to the corresponding human, mouse and rat sequences. The putative catalytic site, the regulatory and basal phosphorylation sites, and the putative lipid-binding domain of the porcine HSL are all highly conserved. Compared to the rat HSL protein, the human and pig homologues are missing twelve, while the mouse six, amino acids, located close to the activity-controlling serine residue. Major differences in the number and identity of amino acids were also observed at the carboxyl-terminal end (Harbitz et al., 1999).

Human and rat HSL show 83% identity at the amino acid level, while the mouse and rat enzymes share a percentage of 94% identity. The molecular organization of mouse and human HSL gene is remarkably similar to each other (they also bear 85% protein identity). Both genes span respective genomic areas of 10–11 Kb and contain nine exons encoding the adipocytes cognate proteins (Holst et al., 1996). Interestingly, despite the high degree of similarity, the three species diverge significantly in a stretch of 16 amino acid residues upstream of the phosphorylation sites (Li et al., 1994).

As Lampidonis et al. (2008a) have recently shown through a multiple alignment strategy, both ovine HSL protein isoforms (accession number

Especially, ovHSL protein bears strong similarities with its bovine counterpart, thus constituting the ruminant sub-group within the mammalian group of HSL proteins.

The, highly significant degree of primary structure conservation among representative mammalian HSL protein family members presumably reflects the functional constrains during evolution, as they have been specifically adapted to fulfill each species' individualized requirements.

## 4. Regulation of HSL enzyme activity

### 4.1. Activation of HSL enzyme

At the beginning of the 1970s, researchers provided several lines of evidence indicating that HSL could be phosphorylated and activated in adipocytes by the cAMP-dependent Protein Kinase (PKA), induced by catabolic hormones, such as corticotropin, adrenaline, noradrenaline and glucagon, through the cAMP signaling cascade (Steinberg and Huttunen, 1972). HSL lipolytic activity is substantially augmented by β-adrenergic agonists and adrenaline or glucagon, whereas insulin evinces an opposite effect, causing a significant reduction in HSL enzymatic potency (Holm et al., 2000). In particular, adrenaline elevates the cAMP pool to activate the dormant PKA (Taylor et al., 2004), which in turn phosphorylates the HSL and Perilipin to increase lipolysis (Tansey et al., 2004). Additionally, acute insulin treatment stimulates a cAMP Phosphodiesterase in an ATP-dependent fashion, promoting cAMP hydrolysis, lowering PKA activity, and decreasing PKA-dependent HSL phosphorylation and activation, and lipolysis as well (Holm et al., 1997). Details of such complex interplay between cAMP and acute insulin administration have been documented in adipocytes and include the stimulation of Protein Kinase B phosphorylation by insulin, which was inhibited by the Epac (Exchange Protein Directly Activated by cAMP) agonist 8-(4chloro-phenylthio)-2-omethyladenosine-3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate (8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP) (Zmuda-Trzebiatowska et al., 2007). Recently, Zentella de Piña et al. (2008) reported that H₂O₂ generated by insulin in rat adipocytes could impair cAMP-mediated amplification cascade of lipolysis. These micromolar concentrations of H₂O₂, added before cAMP, suppressed cAMP-activation of type IIβ-PKA holoenzyme, prevented HSL translocation from the cytosol to storage droplets and inhibited lipolysis.

After β-adrenergic stimulation, HSL is phosphorylated at several serine residues by the cAMP-dependent PKA (Holm et al., 2000). Besides PKA, other protein kinases have also been shown to phosphorylate HSL and regulate the enzyme activity. The list includes

Extracellular Signal-Regulated Kinase (ERK), Glycogen Synthase Kinase-4 (Olsson et al., 1986; Greenberg et al., 2001), Ca²⁺/Calmodulin-dependent Kinase II and AMP-activated Protein Kinase (AMPK) (Garton et al., 1989). The phosphorylated HSL is transported from the cytoplasm to the surface of lipid droplets (Egan et al., 1992). Conversely, a lipid droplet surface protein also phosphorylated by PKA, so-called Perilipin A, shifts to the cytoplasm in response to lipolytic stimulation (Brasaemle et al., 2000a).

### 4.2. HSL phosphorylation sites

A key feature of HSL is its regulation by reversible phosphorylation, which mediates its activation by lipolytic hormones. In general, the extent of HSL activation against triacylglycerol, as a result from its phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent Protein Kinase is 2-fold (Cook et al., 1982; Fredrikson et al., 1981). It has been quoted several times that phosphorylation of HSL is not able to activate its enzymatic function against other lipid substrates or short-chain esters. However, there is evidence that activation against cholesterol esters occurs in response to phosphorylation, but it may well be that the assay conditions for these substrates have not been optimized for the detection of HSL activity (Cook et al., 1982, 1983; Greenberg et al., 2001).

Initial peptide mapping studies have shown that HSL possesses two phosphorylation sites. Site 1 is called the regulatory site and is thought to play a critical role in the activation of HSL. This site is phosphorylated by the cyclic AMP-dependent Protein Kinase and Glycogen Synthase Kinase-4, and is located at the position of Ser-563 in the rat HSL protein sequence (Garton et al., 1988; Olsson et al., 1986; Stralfors and Belfrage, 1983; Stralfors et al., 1984;) (Fig. 5). Interestingly, this kinase is hormonally controlled (Stralfors and Belfrage, 1983; Stralfors et al., 1984). The hormonal regulation seems to involve the widely used signal transduction mechanism of the cyclic AMP-dependent pathway. Site 2 is called the basal site (Stralfors et al., 1984). This site is phosphorylated by two protein kinases, namely the Ca²⁺/Calmodulin-dependent Kinase II and AMP-activated Protein Kinase (Garton et al., 1989), and is placed at the position of Ser-565 in the rat HSL protein sequence (Garton et al., 1988, 1989; Stralfors et al., 1984) (Fig. 5). Phosphorylation on site 2 does not seem to have a direct effect on HSL activity (Garton et al., 1989). Intriguingly, the phosphorylation of these two serine residues (563 and 565) is a mutually exclusive process (Garton et al., 1989; Garton and Yeaman, 1990).

However, the picture has turned out to be more complex, with more phosphorylation sites and additional kinases proved to be involved. Further detailed analysis by Anthonsen and co-workers has provided evidence that the rat HSL protein contains two additional phosphorylation sites that are critically implicated in the regulation of lipase activity (Anthonsen et al., 1998). It has been undoubtedly shown that HSL protein is phosphorylated at the serine residues 659 and 660, which are absolutely required for the phosphorylation-

induced increase in hydrolytic activity towards a triacylglycerol substrate. The above phosphorylated residues are also of critical importance for the translocation of HSL to lipid droplets, upon over expression for a mutated, at serine residues 563 and 565 HSL protein, along with an activated PKA isoform in cultured adipocytes (Anthonsen et al., 1998; Su et al., 2003). Site directed mutagenesis (Ser→Ala) of either the single serine residue 563 or both amino acid residues 563 and 565 did not seem to abolish HSL activity. However, mutagenesis of Ser-565 slightly increased HSL function, a response that could be expected, since removal of this phosphorylation site alleviates its inhibitory functions on the phosphorylation status of Ser-563. In contrast, mutations of the serine residues 659 and 660 resulted in the loss of PKA-stimulated activity against TAG substrate, thus strongly indicating that these novel phosphorylation targets likely constitute the major sites for tightly regulating HSL activity. These observations strongly support previously reported data, demonstrating that phosphorylation at the regulatory site of Ser-563 is not sufficient, or retains a redundant role, for the HSL enzymatic activation, but rather carries a, still, elusive functional property that needs to be further determined (i.e. in vivo substrate recognition, or enhancement of catalytic rate).

Relatively recently, Daval et al. have assigned a role of AMP-Activated Protein Kinase (AMPK) on HSL phosphorylation and lipolysis (Daval et al., 2005). AMPK is a sensor of the cellular energy state that directly responds to metabolic stress and other cytotoxic signals. Activation of AMPK by the specific agonist AICAR (5-amino-4-imidazolecarboxamide riboside) in isolated fat cells results in phosphorylation of the Ser-565 and in reduction of β-adrenergic receptor-stimulated lipolysis in rodent adipocytes. These data strongly suggest that AMPK acts on HSL by blocking its translocation to lipid droplets.

To summarize, according to the recent literature, the phosphorylation events of rat HSL proved to be more complicated than originally reported. Studies using isolated HSL protein have demonstrated that HSL can be phosphorylated on five, at least, serine residues (563, 565, 600, 659 and 660 of the rat sequence; Fig. 5) in vitro. Mutagenesis experiments clearly demonstrate that Ser-563, Ser-659 and Ser-660 represent the major PKA phosphorylation sites responsible for activating HSL, although Ser-563 may not affect the catalytic activity directly (Anthonsen et al., 1998). Moreover, Extracellular Signal-Regulated Kinase (ERK) phosphorylates Ser-600 and increases HSL activity in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (Greenberg et al., 2001). The phosphorylation sites of rat HSL are highly conserved in the human counterpart, with Ser-563, Ser-565, Ser-600, Ser-659 and Ser-660 in the rat enzyme corresponding to Ser-552, Ser-554, Ser-589, Ser-649 and Ser-650 in the human homologue, respectively (Contreras et al., 1998; Watt et al., 2006) (Fig. 5). However, until today only a few studies have addressed the phosphorylation profile of human HSL. These have revealed that the human HSL is activated to a lower extent than rat HSL in vitro and have, furthermore, suggested an important role for Ser-650 in governing the activation in vivo (Contreras et al., 1998; Watt et al., 2003; Talanian et al., 2006). As it has been recently reported by Krintel et al. (2008), activation of human HSL against lipid substrates in response to phosphorylation by PKA in vitro is regulated by Ser-649 and Ser-650, involving alterations in the kinetic behavior of the enzyme. Mutations of Ser-649 and Ser-650 result in loss of lipolytic activity, with lesser effect on non-lipolytic activity. These observations suggest that Ser-649 and Ser-650 are most likely located in the vicinity of a lipid binding region and that phosphorylation by PKA controls the accessibility of this region.

In contrast to phosphorylation, dephosphorylation by phosphatases can also play an important role in HSL regulation. There is strong evidence that phosphatases are critically involved in the anti-lipolytic effect of insulin. The Serine/Threonine Protein Phosphatases responsible for the dephosphorylation of HSL protein in rat adipocytes have also been investigated (Wood et al., 1993), although not in as much

extent as the corresponding kinases. Ser-563 is dephosphorylated efficiently by both PP2A (Protein Phosphatase 2A) and PP2C, while Ser-565 is being dephosphorylated predominantly by PP2A, but with PP1 and PP2C also having a potential significance. Rat adipocytes contain relatively low levels of PP2B, and this does not appear to play an essential role in the regulation of HSL, at least in the particular cell type examined. In view of the identification of additional phosphorylation sites on HSL protein, the dephosphorylation process and relative responses of the enzyme to distinct lipogenic and lipolytic factors, requires further detailed investigation.

### 4.3. Perilipins and HSL translocation

For many years, a controversy was why purified HSL is activated only by, approximately, 3-fold in vitro, following stoichiometric phosphorylation by the cAMP-dependent Protein Kinase (Cook et al., 1982; Fredrikson et al., 1981; Stralfors and Belfrage, 1983), and, yet, lipolytic rates can increase up to 100-fold in fat cells, in response to lipolytic hormones (Londos et al., 1985; Nilsson et al., 1980). This was, at least partly, resolved by the finding that a lipid droplet-associated protein, so-called Perilipin, might play a key role in mediating the association of HSL with its target lipid substrate in an intact adipocyte (Londos et al., 1999). Perilipins are the most heavily modified and post-translationally tagged proteins after lipolytic activation in adipocytes (Egan et al., 1990; Greenberg et al., 1991, 1993). Most interestingly, their response, such as phosphorylation, to lipolytic agents clearly parallels that of HSL. There are multiple Perilipin proteins encoded by mRNA splice variants of a single Perilipin gene. The Perilipin proteins are “poly-phosphorylated” by Protein Kinase A and phosphorylation is necessary for the translocation of HSL to lipid droplets and enhanced lipolysis. Hence, the surface of the lipid storage droplet has emerged as a central site for regulation of lipolysis (Tansey et al., 2004).

An important clue to the HSL translocation process came from an analysis of the lipolytic reaction in the Perilipin-null mouse. Adipocytes from these animals exhibited elevated basal lipolysis, which reflected the loss of the well-established protective effect of Perilipin against TAG breakdown under conditions of a quiescent PKA (Brasaemle et al., 2000b; Souza et al., 1998; Sztalryd et al., 2003; Tansey et al., 2003). Moreover, adipocytes lacking Perilipin also exhibited an almost total loss of β-adrenergic receptor-stimulated lipolysis, despite the presence of normal levels of HSL protein per cell (Tansey et al., 2001). These data strongly suggest that Perilipin is an essential component in the implementation of functional lipolytic activation in adipose cells.

Besides, many studies indicate that HSL translocation requires a PKA-dependent phosphorylation of Perilipin A, which is the predominant Perilipin isoform expressed in mature adipocytes (Sztalryd et al., 2003). Perilipin A, produced from differential splicing as Perilipin B, is the most highly phosphorylated protein in adipocytes stimulated by lipolytic hormones and is absolutely essential for the hydrolysis of TAG by adipocyte lipases. The amino- and carboxyl-termini are also of critical importance to the function of Perilipin A in facilitating triacylglycerol storage (Garcia et al., 2004). Perilipin A is phosphorylated by the cAMP-dependent Protein Kinase A (PKA) and also by the cGMP-dependent Protein Kinase G (PKG), but the phosphorylation dynamics and its consequence in protein activation, have not been explored in detail (Sengenes et al., 2003). Perilipin avulsion causes a dramatic attenuation of hormone-stimulated lipolysis, while it is reported to upgrade the rates of lipolysis under unstimulated conditions. Nevertheless, genetic ablation of Perilipin, which leads to a lean phenotype and resistance to genetic or obesity-promoting diets (Martinez-Botas et al., 2000; Sengenes et al., 2003), also induces alterations in gene expression of the oxidative and lipid biosynthesis pathways in adipose and other peripheral tissues (i.e., liver, skeletal muscle and kidney) (Castro-Chavez et al., 2003). Proteolysis of Perilipin, implicating the lysosomal protein degradation machinery,may constitute a novel mechanism for enhancing adipocyte lipolysis (Kovsan et al., 2007). Moreover, low Perilipin content is tightly associated with a high in vivo lipolytic activity in humans. A reduction in Perilipin expression levels may constitute a dominant mechanism for enhanced adipocyte lipolysis under non-stimulated (basal) conditions, while increased basal lipolysis has been tightly linked to the whole body metabolic deregulation (Mottagui-Tabar et al., 2003).

Interestingly, recent reports have established a new Perilipin family nomenclature, called the “PAT-family”. “PAT” derives from the names of the three proteins. Perilipin, Adipose Differentiation-related Protein (ADFP) and Tail Interacting Protein 47 (TIP47), with each one carrying highly related amino-terminal sequences and similar affinities for intracellular neutral lipid storage droplets (Lu et al., 2001; Kimmel et al., 2010). Additionally, many studies have led to a generally accepted consensus that members of the “PAT-family” of proteins play conserved structural and functional roles on lipid droplets (Sztalryd et al., 2006; Dalen et al., 2007; Bell et al., 2008). Proteomic analysis has also unveiled a “signature” composition for lipid droplets from a variety of cell types that includes at least one “PAT-family” member. In mammalian cells, the “PAT-family” includes Perilipin, ADFP and TIP47, as well as S3-12 and Lipid Storage Droplet Protein 5 (LSDP5). Perilipin represents the major “PAT” protein associated with the lipid droplet surface in mature adipocytes and is a major regulatory factor for lipolysis, being the only member of “PAT” proteins that proved to be phosphorylated by PKA (Martinez-Botas et al., 2000; Tansey et al., 2001).

### 5. Concluding remarks

Even though the enzymatic pathways of lipids are extensively studied, their regulation remains, for a big part, still unexplored and deserves further investigation. A key component in the breakdown of stored lipids, and, thereby in the regulation of energy availability, is the rate-limiting enzyme HSL. We have herein, tried to present an updated overview of all aspects of HSL Biology, based on the currently available literature. The reader must have clearly realized that our knowledge on HSL, and its related subjects, although growing, is still incomplete.

In general, HSL and ATGL govern the capacity of adipose and non-adipose tissues to mobilize fatty acids. Recent studies proved that ATGL (along with the interacting partner CGI-58) is the major enzyme responsible for the first step in TAG mobilization, while HSL is the rate-limiting component for subsequent degradation of DAG. In the final hydrolytic phase, MGL releases the third FA from the glycerol backbone. Each step provides a number of metabolic intermediates that act as precursors for a variety of metabolic pathways, as well as bioactive molecules, in cell signaling and gene regulation. Although ATGL, HSL and MGL contribute more than 95% of the lipolytic capacity in WAT, it is reasonable to accept that other lipases are also critically implicated in fat cell physiology. However, their role in the functional control of TAG lipolysis remains, still, questionable. Three additional to ATGL/Desnutrin Adiponutrin family members (GS2, GS2-Like and PNPLA1) have been identified (Jenkins et al., 2004; Lake et al., 2005). GS2 is a TAG lipase characterized by a Patatin homology domain, which includes a combination of the G/AXGXXG and GXSXG motifs that are highly conserved in Calcium-Independent Phospholipase A2 family members. GS2 transcripts have been detected only in humans (Lake et al., 2005). The lipases, in general, are expressed and regulated in a manner consistent with a role in energy homeostasis, but additional studies are necessary to illuminate their roles and importance in cellular pathophysiology.

Other lipases, such as Carboxylesterase-3 (Ces-3) (Soni et al., 2004), Triacylglycerol Hydrolase-2 (TGH-2) and Triacylglycerol Hydrolase-1 (TGH-1) (Okazaki et al., 2006) contribute to TAG hydrolysis under certain physiological conditions in WAT and other tissues. Carboxylesterase 3 has been proposed to carry a non-HSL activity in WAT, in vitro, therefore suggesting an engagement of an HSL-independent lipolytic pathway in adipocytes. TGH-2 and TGH-1

lipases have been adequately characterized in terms of their tissue distribution, sub-cellular localization, substrate specificity and regulation of activity. A serious complication to study their individual properties and actions comes from the remarkable structural resemblance to a Triacylglycerol Hydrolase (TGH) sequence “consensus” of a 70.4% identity percentage (Okazaki et al., 2006).

Besides their roles as energy substrates, the lipolytic products FAs, DAG and MAG exert other fundamental physiological functions as precursors of various lipid classes, such as membrane lipids, prostaglandins and leukotrienes. Many of these lipids, as well as FA and DAG molecules *per se*, act as critical components in several signal transduction pathways and regulation of gene transcription (i.e., PPARs). A thorough analysis and understanding of the lipase mode of action and lipolysis dynamics are issues of major importance.

Since HSL and ATGL are both essentially involved in TAG hydrolysis, specific inhibitors targeting this process could likely behave as potent and highly promising drugs (Wang and Fotsch, 2006). However, drug discovery and design efforts have not focused, until now, on therapeutics directed towards targeting anti-lipolytic pathways, except Niacin utilization (Karpe and Frayn, 2004).

Moreover, a better dissection of the lipolytic mechanism and its detailed elucidation might lead to pharmacological treatment platforms, controlling the release of FAs and other lipolytic products involved in the development of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes and, additionally, in the illumination of lipase family functions in acquired conditions, like obesity and pathogenesis of metabolic disorders, including inherited diseases, such as Neutral Lipid Storage Disease (NLSD) in humans. NLSD is a rare, autosomal genetic disorder, characterized by systemic accumulation of TAG in all tissues of the body. It is diagnosed by increased TAG storage in blood granulocytes (referred to as Jordans' anomaly) (Pena-Penabad et al., 2001).

To summarize, according to the available and up to date existing literature, the coordinated interaction and functional synergism among ATGL, HSL and MGL enzymes in the production of FAs and intermediate acylglycerols require better characterization. The role of these lipases in regulating the generation and catabolism of signaling lipids has been largely overlooked and needs to be addressed again in a more analytical, targeted and integrated fashion. Furthermore, future studies must be devoted to the molecular characterization of the defects affecting genes encoding the various elements of signal transduction pathways and enzymes involved in the control of lipolysis, as well as in the lipolytic and anti-lipolytic mechanisms.
