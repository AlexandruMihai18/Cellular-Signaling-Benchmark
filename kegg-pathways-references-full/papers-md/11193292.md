**Abstract.** Replication of eukaryotic linear chromosomes is incomplete and leaves terminal gaps. The evolutionary widely distributed solution to this “end replication” is twofold: chromosome ends are capped with telomeres, bearing multiple copies of redundant telomeric sequences, and the telomerase enzyme can add (lost) telomeric repeats. Telomerase in humans, as in all mammals, is ubiquitous in all embryonic tissues. In adults, telomerase remains active in germ cells, and, although down-regulated in most somatic tissues, telomerase is active in regenerative tissues and notably, in tumor cells. Telomerase activity is linked to cellular proliferation, and its activation seems to be a mandatory step in carcinogenesis. In contrast to mammals, indeterminately growing multicellular organisms, like fish and crustaceae, maintain unlimited growth potential or 'immortality' in all somatic tissues throughout their entire life. Also this cell immortalization is brought about by maintaining telomerase expression. Disease prognosis for human tumors includes evaluation of cell proliferation, based on the detection of proliferation markers with monoclonal antibodies. The significance of the classical marker Ki-67, and of a novel marker repp-86 are compared with semiquantitative telomerase assays. For tumor therapy, telomerase inhibitors are attractive tools. Results with telomerase knock-out mice have revealed promise, but also risk of this approach. On the other side, telomerase stimulation is attractive for expanding the potential of cellular proliferation *in vitro*, with possible applications for transplantation of *in vitro* expanded human cells, for immortalizing primary human cells as improved tissue models, and for the isolation of otherwise intractable products, like genuine human monoclonal antibodies.

## Introduction

Almost ten years ago, excitement was created in biomedical research after the first proclaimed linkage of telomerase expression and tumorigenesis. Experimental tests of this hypothetical claim were the basis for exponential increase of publications in this field, and a “time-table” on pertinent findings in telomere/telomerase research is provided in Table 1. This review focuses on the linkage between telomerase expression and cellular proliferation and on potential practical application in tumor diagnostics.

End replication problem with double-stranded DNA. Replication of internal sequences is assured, even in the synthesis of the discontinuous lagging strand (left loop). At termini, only the leading strand reaches the very 5′-end of the template. A large stretch (ca. 50 bp) is lost in the lagging strand, due to imprecise start (as in panel A) and because DNA replication requires RNA primers (hatched blocks). Subsequently, these primers are removed by RNase H and at the very end, they cannot be replaced. This figure was reproduced from ref. 223.

## The end replication problem – and how it can be solved

The duplication of all types of linear genomes is hampered by the “end replication problem”. Obviously, a very precise initiation of the 5′-terminal synthesis of the new nucleic acid chain is mandatory to provide an accurate duplication without loss of a single nucleotide (Fig. 1A). This has been realized in the replication of some RNA and DNA viruses which carry a covalently linked protein at the 5′-end of their genomic nucleic acid. Examples are poliovirus RNA, adenovirus DNA and bacteriophage φ29 DNA [1]. The starter nucleotide is attached to the protein and the complex is precisely positioned at the very 3′-end of the template. This guarantees the complete replication of the viral genome.

If the complete replication of the termini is not warranted, a repair mechanism for lost nucleotides provides an alternative. Numerous “end solutions” have been found in nature and several are presented here.

## Molecular fossils from RNA genomes

RNA genomes route back to the primordial, prebiotic RNA world. One “end solution” is the restoration of a few lost nucleotides by the precise addition of 3′-terminal nucleotides, independent of any template. Today, an enzyme with this function is still ubiquitous: the tRNA nucleotidyl transferase which adds (or repairs) the CCA-end of tRNAs. Interestingly, the RNA genomes of many plant viruses carry tRNA-like 3′-terminal structures. This means, truncated 3′-termini can be regenerated by the tRNA nucleotidyl transferase. Thus, the viral tRNA-like end can be considered as archetype of a “telomeric structure” with a corresponding repair enzyme or “telomerase” [2,3].

# Eukaryotic chromosomes

The end replication problem for linear DNA was anticipated almost thirty years ago [4–6]. DNA replication is hampered by the incapacity of DNA polymerases for *de novo* initiation of nucleic acid synthesis; this capacity is limited to RNA polymerases. DNA replication is absolutely dependent on preformed primers, and in cellular DNA replication short RNA chains are provided as primers [1]. Subsequently, these RNA primers are removed, thus leaving behind an even larger gap (Fig. 1B). The ends of eukaryotic chromosomes are provided with two different, but related “end solutions”. First, their telomeres contain multiple copies of telomeric repeat sequences. This means they provide a “buffer” function and significant truncations can occur without immediate deleterious effects. Second, (lost) telomeric repeats can be added by telomerase.

## Telomere structures

In most eukaryotes, telomeres contain double-stranded, short G-rich repeats. The short telomeric repeat sequences were found in unicellular eukaryotes—intensively studied are ciliates [7] and yeasts [8]. They exist in multicellular organisms, including all vertebrates [9], plants [10], arthropods, like the insect *Bombyx mori* (lepidopteran silk moth) [11] and the crustacean *Homarus americanus* (American lobster) [12]. Several years later it was shown that telomeres terminate with a 3′-protruding, single-stranded overhang [13,14]; in humans, these single-stranded tails are up to 200 nucleotides long [15]. In vitro, the G-rich single-stranded segments can fold back to form intramolecular hairpins and tetrads with non-canonical G<sub>anti</sub>:G<sub>syn</sub> pairs [16]. The immediate result is a sequestered 3′-end of the chromosomal DNA. This is an attractive explanation for protection against exonucleolytic attack and prevention of the otherwise high recombinogenic activity of DNA termini, which is generally observed with exogenously added linear DNA [17] or at the internally generated ends of broken chromosomes [18]. Functional evidence for these structures *in vivo* is lacking, although some support was provided by findings that telomerase is inhibited by compounds which either interfere or stabilize tetrads with their non-canonical base pairs [19] (see also below, section “telomerase inhibitors”). The structure of native telomeres is complex and several human telomere binding proteins have been described like hnRNP A1 [20], TRF1 [21], TRF2 [22] and tankyrase [23]. TRF1 is directly involved in maintaining telomere length [24] and TRF2 in the functional sequestration of DNA ends [25]. Recent, ingenious analysis of telomere structures by electron microscopy has revealed that telomeres are not simply stretched-out linear structures, rather they form so-called “t loops”. This means, the linear, single-stranded end is folded back and tucked into intratelomeric stretches of double-stranded telomeric repeat sequences, presumably mediated by binding of TRF2 at these junctions [26]. These t loops were not only formed *in vitro*, they were also isolated after *in vivo* cross-linking [26]. The full molecular details are not yet known, e.g., the possible

involvement of G-tetrads.

Exceptional structures were reported for dipteran insects. Their telomeres contain very large repeat elements with >6 kb in *Drosophila* [27] and 340–350 bp in *Chironomus* [28]. Although very different from the standard telomere, they share mechanistic similarities. Also the maintenance of these “retroposons” requires RNA-template dependant reverse transcription, at least in *Drosophila*, whereas RNA-independent mechanisms are discussed for *Chironomus* and *Anopheles* [reviewed by Pardue; ref. 29].

## Molecular characterization of the telomerase enzyme

As a reference guide for this chapter, the presently known subunits and their functions are listed in Table 2. Direct studies of the enzyme from higher eukaryotes were impossible due to its scarcity, estimated at only about 100 copies per cell [30]. All molecular studies had to take a detour via ciliates, the prime organisms for telomerase studies due to their unique genome organization. In their micronucleus the genome is contained within normal chromosomes. Within a short period, the transcriptionally active macronucleus is generated *de novo* from these chromosomes and thousands of subchromosomal DNA molecules are made, all of which have newly synthesized terminal telomeric repeats [7, 31, 32]. Obviously, this necessitates an extremely high telomerase activity, about 1000-fold higher than in human cell lines [30]. This made it possible to discover the enzyme telomerase and detect an essential RNA component, thus characterizing telomerase as a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) enzyme [33]. The first success on the molecular level was the identification and sequencing of the RNA component of *Tetrahymena* telomerase [34]. This unique enzyme can be regarded as a specialized reverse transcriptase which includes its own template: a short stretch of the enzyme’s RNA component encodes the telomeric repeat sequence. Several years later, the RNA subunit of human telomerase was sequenced [35]. With its template for telomeric repeats, telomerase is shown schematically in Fig. 2. Again, several years passed by, until the first gene sequences of protein subunits, p80 and p95 from *Tetrahymena* were known [36]. These hallmark results spurred search for human homologs which succeeded in the cDNA sequence of hTEP1 [37, 38], the homolog for p80.

However, sequence comparisons did not reveal any of them as a presumptive polymerase subunit. This search again succeeded via purification of the enzyme from the ciliate *Euplotes* with the identification of two associated protein bands in SDS gels, p123 and p43 [39]. Fortuitously the further hunt could be combined with an independent genetic approach in the yeast *S. cerevisiae*. The prey were p123 from *Euplotes* and *est2* (encoding a 103 kD protein) from yeast, containing the long sought-for sequence motives of a reverse transcriptase enzyme [40]. Another homology search ensued, yielding cDNA sequences for the catalytic subunits hTERT from human [41-44], and in a hindsight search also p133 from *Tetrahymena* telomerase [45].

Fig. 2. Schematic action of telomerase. Telomeres contain double stranded DNA (solid bars) with long single stranded 3′-extensions (capitals). The ribonucleoprotein enzyme telomerase elongates these stretches in a step-wise manner. It contains an RNA subunit with the indicated template region (small letters). A second template binding domain, the “anchor site” is indicated as a separate subunit. The molecular entity is p95 in *Tetrahymena* [206] and p130 in *Euplotes*, a not yet further characterized protein [207]. Although some data suggest an anchor site in human telomerase [52], the functional subunit was not yet identified in a metazoan telomerase complex.

The minimal elements of a core human telomerase enzyme were suggested from *in vitro* reconstitution experiments. Transcripts from the RNA component hTERC were combined *in situ* with ongoing *in vitro* translation of the catalytic subunit hTERT in rabbit reticulocyte lysate [46,47]. In this experiment, the involvement of rabbit homologs for hTEP1 (and other as yet unknown mammalian telomerase components) is uncertain and the search goes on. A homolog for p95, the template binding “anchor” subunit from *Tetrahymena* was not yet identified. The protein p43, a potential small subunit from *Euplotes* awaits characterization of its function and of its homologs in other species. The direct characterization of the human telomerase complex (or from another vertebrate) is a formidable challenge and the possibility of accessory components with regulatory functions is barely explored.

Fig. 3. Detection of telomerase with PCR-coupled TRAP assay. Left panel: Schematic principle of the TRAP assay [51], modified according to Krupp and coworkers [84, 100]. Primer TS with a non-telomeric sequence (box) is a substrate for telomerase which adds telomeric repeats (arrows). The very small amount of the resulting products is amplified by PCR with excess primer CX-ext which is complementary to the added repeats and in the extended version [100] contains an extra 5'-terminal sequence (encircled X). Subsequently, the amplified products are analyzed by gel electrophoresis and detected by fluorescence or by staining, and they derive from the undesired but unavoidable primer dimers (bottom section). Larger products (as with authentic telomerase activity) result from primer slippage, if the reverse primer anneals out of register (bottom line). With the extra sequence at CX-ext, mismatched bases block the extension and amplification of these erroneous products (for more details, see ref. 100). Middle panel: Example results with telomerase positive cell line L 428. PCR products were analyzed by capillary electrophoresis on ABI Prism 310. As control for PCR efficiency, an internal amplification standard (ITAS) was co-amplified. Positions of primer dimer and ITAS are indicated. Please note the regular ladder of telomerase products with 6 bp increments. Right panel: Semiquantitative data of the TRAP assay versus number of cells in the assay. Data are shown in double logarithmic scale (for more details, see Ref. 84).

Setting the stage for functional telomerase analysis

The pioneering studies with ciliates could be performed with a direct primer elongation assay, where the enzyme telomerase adds telomeric repeats on a DNA primer in the presence of α-32P-GTP. The products were detected by gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. This direct assay was also successfully applied to characterize telomerase from an easily available human source, from immortalized cell lines [48] and for the first detection of telomerase in human tumors [49,50].

The stage for large-scale analysis of telomerase was set with the invention of the PCR-based TRAP assay for telomerase [51] (Fig. 3). The development of this assay format was not straightforward. In the standard PCR approach, the amplified sequence is enclosed by two primers which hybridize specifically to terminal sequences at both ends. However, this is impossible with telomerase products. They contain only repetitive DNA sequences: primers with telomeric repeat sequences are elongated with further repeats. At least one unique primer sequence was possible after Morin had observed that several primers with non-telomeric sequences are efficiently elongated by human telomerase [52]. Only the very sensitive TRAP assay permitted the detection of telomerase in crude lysates from cells and tumor biopsies, and spurred extensive, ongoing activities in cancer and telomerase research. Problems and their solutions which hampered application of this first assay format will be discussed below (section “experimental considerations”). Until 1994, the number of publications related to telomerase research were < 30 per year, afterwards the numbers doubled each year with > 500 in 1998.

Functional linkage of telomerase with cellular ageing and with carcinogenesis

In 1990, the available experimental analysis of telomere length in human tissues had revealed (i) a gradual telomere length shortening in lymphocytes with increased age of the donor [53,54]; (ii) within the same individual, longer telomere lengths in germline than in somatic cells [55-57]; (iii) shorter telomere lengths in tumor biopsies than in adjacent normal tissue [53,57]. These results prompted the hypothesis for the role of telomere length as a “mitotic clock” in cellular ageing and in carcinogenesis [58,59] (Fig. 4), providing a mechanistic model for the “Hayflick limit” [60]: proliferation of telomerase negative cells results in telomere shortening or “replicative ageing”, leading to cellular senescence and death [54]. In contrast, immortalized human cell lines express telomerase activity which arrests telomere shortening and resets the mitotic clock [61]. A consequent extension was the postulation that telomerase is also active in indefinitely growing human carcinoma cells [58,59]. In the model for carcinogenesis, mutational events result in loss of proliferation control and rapid proliferation of telomerase negative tumor-progenitor cells leads to replicative ageing and shortened telomeres. In a later stage, telomerase is reactivated to rather high levels and thus stabilizes the previously

Fig. 4. Graphic presentation of the initial telomere/telomerase hypothesis [58] as exemplified by Harley [59]. The model applies primarily to human development. The broken lines indicate unknown status in embryonic tissues. Germ cells are telomerase active, sufficient to maintain the long telomeres. All somatic cells were expected to be telomerase negative, resulting in the indicated loss of telomeric DNA. If a critical telomere length is reached for one or for several chromosomes within a cell, a checkpoint signal stops cell division (Hayflick limit). This block can be bypassed if growth control is lost by transformation, and continued cell division leads to almost complete elimination of telomeres. Chromosome fusions and genomic aberrations become frequent after the Hayflick limit and lethal if crisis is reached. Further cell division requires reactivation of telomerase to maintain telomere length at sufficiently high levels. This behaviour was observed in culturing primary cells in vitro, with rare events of established immortalized cell lines. A similar series of events was postulated in carcinogenesis and immortalization of tumor cells (which were postulated to be telomerase positive). This figure was reproduced from ref. 223.

shortened telomeres [58,59].

Only in 1994, this hypothesis for carcinogenesis received experimental support when telomerase was detected in tumor biopsies, with ovarian and hematopoietic carcinoma as the first examples [49,50]. Subsequently, the very difficult direct assay for detection of telomerase in tissue lysates was replaced by the PCR-based TRAP assay (see above). This extended the range of analyzed clinical samples dramatically. Already the initial publication of the TRAP assay included a wide panel of human tumor biopsies as well as normal human somatic tissue samples. Almost all analyzed tumors (90%) were telomerase positive, whereas normal references were negative [51].

As a model for differentiated cells in telomerase negative somatic tissues, differentiation effects were analyzed in several cell lines. Promyelocytic HL60 cells can be induced to differentiate to granulocyte-like cells and become postmitotic by treatment with chemicals like all-trans-retinoic acid or DMSO. Similarly, sodium butyrate can induce differentiation of the erythroid leukemia cell line
K-562. In these studies, differentiation and proliferation arrest were coupled. These events resulted in rapid, drastic and irreversible telomerase inhibition [62-64]. It is important to note that this decline of telomerase activity was much faster than the observed half-life (24 h) after shut down of protein synthesis with cycloheximide [63]. In consequence, not only enzyme replenishing is inhibited, also a mechanism for rapid destruction of telomerase is activated.

After obtaining more detailed results of telomerase expression in normal tissues, the initial model for carcinogenesis required revisions. It had been postulated as conversion from differentiated, telomerase negative cells to telomerase positive tumor cells. The first reports suggested a very low abundance of telomerase positive cells (if any) in normal somatic tissues. This argued against the possibility that the clonal expansion of telomerase positive cells could lead to the establishment of tumors, which requires the combination of several very infrequent steps. It seemed also plausible that tumor cells with significantly shortened telomeres originated from telomerase negative cells. Telomere erosion would result from a transient phase of cellular proliferation in the absence of telomerase [65]. However, as already evidenced in hematopoietic stem cells in older individuals, even “the presence of telomerase does not necessarily imply stable and thus unchanging telomere lengths” [66]. The carcinogenesis concept was challenged and a revised version was postulated by Greaves [67] (Fig. 5), at least valid in the genesis of leukemia. Greaves’ model was based on the more recent findings, that hematopoietic progenitor cells as well as lymphocytes in peripheral blood were found to be “telomerase competent” [68–70]. This means, if they are non-dividing or quiescent, they are telomerase negative, and in response to stimulated proliferation, they become telomerase positive [70-74]. These rather abundant telomerase competent blood cells present a reasonable potential for carcinogenesis and their phenotypes resemble more closely the “dedifferentiated” leukemia tumor cells.

This situation is not restricted to blood, since cells in all tissue sections with a high turnover must possess a high proliferation potential, and ensuing research revealed that these cells have retained their telomerase competence. Apart from the hematopoietic stem cells and lymphocytes [68-70], this includes skin keratinocytes [75,76], intestinal crypt cells [77], and proliferating entities in hair follicles [78] and in endometrium [79–83]. These findings are remarkable, considering the serious practical limitations. In mixed samples, the TRAP assay is rather insensitive, only 1 equivalent of highly proliferating, telomerase positive tumor cells could be detected in 300 equivalents of telomerase negative fibroblasts [84]. Even with claimed sensitivities of 1 in 10000, detection of the presumptive telomerase competent stem cells remains problematic, because only proliferating cells display telomerase activity. Telomerase competent stem cells are non-proliferating, with proliferation and telomerase activity restricted to their immediate derivatives. The now well documented, widespread presence of telomerase competent cells makes them reasonable targets for initial establishment of tumors in general, not only restricted to leukemia [76,84].

It remains to be shown, how telomere erosion is stopped. The already present

Fig. 5. Revised telomere/telomerase hypothesis, based on discussions by Greaves [67], Shay & Wright [65], Shay et al. [66] and others (see section “functional linkage of telomerase with cellular ageing and with carcinogenesis”). In embryonic tissues, telomerase activity had been detected [92], now shown as solid line. Two features remain unchanged: Germ cells are telomerase active, sufficient to maintain the long telomeres. *In vitro* culture of telomerase negative cells, but they are limited to some cell types, e.g. fibroblasts. However, cells in regenerative tissue sections *in vivo* remain telomerase competent: if quiescent (stem cells), they are telomerase negative; proliferating progenitor cells (including lymphocytes in peripheral blood) are telomerase positive, but this is insufficient to prevent telomere erosion. In tumorigenesis, telomerase positive cells have lost growth control and during their fast expansion, telomere loss speeds up. At a threshold (variable for cell type and tumor entity?), telomere length is stabilized, possibly by elevated telomerase levels. Another postulation may be added for indeterminately growing animals: Proliferating cells in all somatic tissues have high telomerase activity, as shown for lobster [12]. This figure was reproduced from ref. 223.

telomerase activity in regenerating somatic tissues seems insufficient to maintain long telomeres, but a telomerase increase in tumor cells may be unnecessary, because there is a positive feedback mechanism which should favour the elongation of short telomeres [24]. As another possibility, a significant increase of telomerase activity may be required to maintain the short telomeres or to lengthen the already critically shortened telomeres and keep their increased length constant. Depending on the actual mechanism, high telomerase levels reflect either a high fraction of fast proliferating tumor cells in the tumor biopsy or a really elevated telomerase activity in the individual tumor cell. The second alternative gets some support from recent findings that high telomerase activity in tumor samples (endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the uterus) correlated with faster dividing cells (a very short G₁ phase in the cell cycle) [85] (see below, section “tumor diagnostics”).

Telomerase activity is linked to cellular proliferation

Most tumor biopsies as well as *in vitro* proliferating tumor-derived, immortalized cell lines have been reported as telomerase positive [51]. With the *bona fide* telomerase competent cell lines, careful monitoring of proliferation and its relation to telomerase activity should provide valuable insights into telomerase regulation *in vivo*. This is of prime importance in the evaluation of telomerase activity as a novel tumor marker and of potential side effects of telomerase inhibitors. Apart from morphological examinations, the established grading of tumors relies on determination of the fraction of actively proliferating cells in tumor biopsies, in general based on the immunohistochemical detection of proliferation markers with monoclonal antibodies. A widely accepted marker is Ki-67 [86, 87] and monoclonal antibodies for its detection, like Ki-S5 [88].

The following section summarizes reports about correlation of proliferation and telomerase activity *in vitro* and *in vivo* with (i) immortalized human cell lines *in vitro*, (ii) human blood lymphocytes and epithelial cells *in vitro*, (iii) human tissue sections *in vivo*, (iv) whole, indeterminately growing organisms.

(i) Effects of starvation (serum depletion) on the proliferation reduction of human tumor cell lines were analyzed by monitoring cellular proliferation with Ki-S5. After four days in the absence of serum, a significant proliferation reduction (from >90% to 70% Ki-S5 positive) ensued which was reelevated upon readdition of serum. The changes in telomerase activity were qualitatively similar and reversible as well, but quantitatively much more pronounced (minimum at ca. 20% of the initial value) [84]. Holt et al. have reduced growth by serum depletion or by contact inhibition and monitored proliferation by cellular DNA content. They reported similar dynamics in telomerase activity of murine [63] as well as of human cell lines [89].

(ii) Studies with *in vitro* proliferation of normal human cells and tissues were already closer to *in vivo* situations. T-lymphocytes from peripheral blood have only low telomerase activity [68–70], and some somatic epithelial tissue samples (uroepithelial, breast, prostate) are completely negative [90]. However, telomerase activity drastically increased upon *in vitro* stimulation of cellular proliferation [70–74, 90].

(iii) Several detailed *in vivo* studies (with human samples) were performed with proliferating, normal somatic tissue sections. Telomerase activity in human skin was potentially localized in the epidermis (at least in foreskin from newborns) [75]. Mechanical and enzymatic dissection of the skin corroborated these findings and assigned the source of telomerase to the basal layer of the epidermis. But it remained unclear if telomerase activity was derived from stem cells or from keratinocytes, their proliferating derivatives [76]. In hair follicles, telomerase activity was clearly concentrated in mitotically active segments, but not within sections with quiescent stem cells [78]. An example of continuous changes between low and high cellular proliferation is the cyclic, hormonally controlled renewal of the functional layer of the human female endometrium. Several groups detected
telomerase activity in proliferative phases of the endometrium and the suspected source were stem cells or their immediate derivatives in the basal layer [79-82]. More recent data confined the major telomerase activity to the highly proliferating functional layer and not to the less proliferating basal layer where the presumptive quiescent stem cells reside [83]. Quantitative changes in telomerase activity were parallel to changes in the expression of the established proliferation marker Ki-67 and of a novel marker repp-86 (restrictedly expressed proliferation-associated protein of 86 kD) which is expressed only in actively cycling cells, monitored with the monoclonal antibody Ki-S2 [83,84,91,222] (see also below, section “tumor diagnostics”). In conclusion, quiescent cells are always telomerase negative and cellular proliferation is a prerequisite for activation of the enzyme in telomerase competent cells.

(iv) Initially, telomerase research was focused on unicellular organisms, ciliates and yeasts. These organisms have no defined growth phase and individuals do not die, but live on after cell division. In sharp contrast are mammals, the other well studied group. Mammals grow only in their youth, but adults have no net length increase and live on only in their progeny, derived from specialized germline cells. Most differentiated cells are postmitotic and a high proliferation potential is required only in stem cells and their immediate derivatives, which remain telomerase competent (see above). This expression pattern is closely followed in humans. Only samples from human embryonic organs are telomerase positive, whereas telomerase is undetectable from the neonatal period onward [92]. Some liver samples from patients with hepatitis and liver cirrhosis were telomerase positive which may indicate a less tight shut-off in this organ [93,94]. Mice are different from humans, with the very large telomeres in *Mus musculus* and with a comparable, but less stringent down-regulation of telomerase which remains readily detectable in liver, kidney and spleen of adult mice, but is absent in brain [95–97].

A completely different group of multicellular organisms display indeterminate growth, this means continuous growth throughout life. Some examples are plants, micelles of fungi, as well as some animals, including species of molluscs, arthropods, amphibians, reptiles and fish. This continuous growth requires the maintenance of a high proliferation potential in all somatic tissues. Possibly, the concomitantly required telomere maintenance is based on ubiquitous telomerase expression in all proliferating tissues.

This expectation was fulfilled in several examples. For the analysis of plant telomerase it was necessary to modify the TRAP assay. The reverse primer was changed to accommodate the plant telomeric repeat sequence TTTAGGG. The assay revealed that mitotically active meristematic tissue and cultured cells *in vitro* have high telomerase activity, whereas non-dividing cells from leaves and axillary buds are telomerase negative [98,99].

As an example from the animal kingdom, the American lobster (*Homarus americanus*) was analyzed. The telomeric repeat sequence was unknown and the TRAP assay was used, as developed for the vertebrate sequence TTAGGG [100].The resulting, PCR-amplified telomerase products were cloned and sequenced. This revealed the repeat sequence TTAGG, already known from another arthropod, the insect *Bombyx mori* [11]. In the indeterminately growing lobster, cells in all tissues must proliferate, and rather high telomerase activities were detected in all samples from (with decreasing activity) hepatopancreas, heart, skin and muscle [12].

Interesting data were obtained from a vertebrate, the rainbow trout (*Oncorhynchus mykiss*). Since telomeric repeat sequences are conserved for all vertebrates, the TRAP assay permitted a direct, quantitative comparison with human cell lines. Regardless of the age or weight of the fish (4 g up to 2000 g), samples from all organs contained extreme telomerase activities. The highest values were found in liver and kidney, more than 100-fold higher than in optimally proliferating human tumor cell lines [101]. The fraction of proliferating cells in thin sections from fish tissue can be determined with a monoclonal antibody for PCNA, the proliferating cell nuclear antigen [102] and thus detected proliferation levels (data not shown) could be correlated with relative telomerase levels.

## Potential practical applications

### I. Tumor diagnostics

In early expectations, telomerase activity was regarded as a novel marker which is unique to tumor cells. With proliferating germ cells as the only exception, telomerase was expected to be absent in all normal somatic tissues and in benign lesions, but universally present in all tumor entities.

This expectation still holds only for a single entity, brain tumors [103–107]. Most, if not all normal brain cells in mammals are postmitotic and no telomerase expression occurs. Fortunately, also benign neoplastic lesions were found telomerase negative and a high correlation was observed between telomerase activity, malignancy and recurrence of tumors. In a study with 30 patients with meningioma [105], 25 patients without detectable telomerase activity had no relapse, whereas five patients with telomerase positive samples had recurrence of cancer. In another study with 105 patients with neuroblastoma [107] the absence of telomerase activity was associated with spontaneous regression, whereas high activity (23 patients) correlated with poor prognosis.

Results with other tumor entities are not so clear-cut since normal reference tissues are also telomerase positive. Nevertheless, if different quantitative levels of telomerase activity are compared, high levels indicate poor prognosis. This was reported for acute leukemia [108,109] and for breast cancer [110–112]. Increasing telomerase levels were correlated with skin tumor progression [75,113,114]. Initial reports of a similar correlation in gastric cancer [115,116] were questioned later [117]. More details are available in recent reviews by Urquidi et al. [118], Shay [119], McKenzie [120], in books [30], and in special issues of the Eur. J. Cancer [122] and of Biochemistry (Moscow) [123].
The cell cycle

![Diagram of the cell cycle phases](#)

Fig. 6. Overview of cell cycle phases. Relative duration of the cell cycle phases. Note that G₁ phase can be very short or last for several years. Proliferation marker protein Ki-67 is expressed in all phases, excluding only quiescent cells in G₀ phase. Expression of repp 86 is more restricted and thus specific for S, G₂ and M phase, and it is absent in G₁ phase. Both marker proteins can be detected with monoclonal antibodies, Ki-67 with Ki-S5 and repp 86 with Ki-S2 (see Fig. 7).

Further evaluation of telomerase activity as a novel tumor marker should be based on the comparison with other established markers in tumor diagnostics, like determination of the fraction of actively proliferating cells in tumor biopsies. Immunohistochemical detection of proliferation markers is accomplished with monoclonal antibodies, like Ki-S5 for the widely accepted marker Ki-67 [86–88]. This marker protein is not expressed in quiescent cells (cell cycle phase G₀) but present in proliferating cells (all phases of the cell cycle: G₁, S, G₂ and M). A shortcoming of this proliferation marker is the inclusion of G₁ with its highly variable duration. Recently, a monoclonal antibody Ki-S2 was described, which detects the novel, more specific marker repp-86 that is expressed only in phases S, G₂ and M [121,91,222]. With this antibody, applicable for paraffin-embedded thin sections, the “actively cycling” cell fraction is demarcated (Fig. 6) and it has been shown to carry independent prognostic significance for endometrioid adenocarcinoma [91] and for breast cancer [222].

In a recent study enrolling 53 patients with uterine endometrioid adenocarcinoma, both proliferation markers and quantitative telomerase levels were evaluated [85]. Examples for the immunostaining of paraffin-embedded thin sections with Ki-S2 and Ki-S5 are shown in Fig. 7. A general comparison of proliferation indices and telomerase levels showed a significant correlation between relative telomerase activity and Ki-S5, but association with Ki-S2 and the Ki-S2/Ki-S5 ratio was much stronger. Single case analysis revealed that tumors with higher Ki-S2/Ki-S5 ratios expressed exponentially higher levels of telomerase (Fig. 8). Most important, a

Samples of FIGO stage Ic are compared with increasing FIGO grades, which means increasing negative prognosis. Two slides at the left at FIGO grade 1, middle at grade 2 and right at grade 3 (4 μm thin sections with immunoperoxidase staining, counterstaining with hemalaun, original magnification 300x).

high Ki-67 tumor growth fraction (labeled with Ki-S5 antibody) was no required prerequisite of telomerase activation. This can be illustrated with four cases with an identical value of 30% for the Ki-S5+ tumor growth fraction and varying proportions of the Ki-S2+ actively cycling subpopulation between 11% and 27%, corresponding to Ki-S2/Ki-S5 ratios of 0.38, 0.39, 0.6 and 0.9. The associated relative telomerase levels were 10%, 8%, 60% and 170%, respectively. The meaning of these results is that increased telomerase activity in endometrioid adenocarcinoma is not a marker of cell proliferation, but it indicates a higher fraction of cells with unphysiologically

Fig. 8. Single case analysis reveals that tumors with high Ki-S2/Ki-S5 ratio express exponentially increasing levels of relative telomerase activity. Values (arbitrary units) indicate Ki-S2/Ki-S5 ratio x 100 and the relative telomerase levels. A value of 100 corresponds to 100% of the activity of the tumor cell line L428 as a positive reference, based on identical amounts of protein in the telomerase TRAP assay [83-85,100].

elevated Ki-S2 levels and thus with a deregulated cell cycle. Normal, even very fast proliferating germ or bone marrow cells maintain a Ki-S2/Ki-S5 ratio at or below 0.4 [124] and this means, duration of the G₁ phase is 60% or more of the total cell cycle. The Ki-S2/Ki-S5 ratios in tumor samples were much higher, and an observed value of 0.9 means that duration of G₁ phase was reduced to mere 10% of the cell cycle. Another possibility is a deregulated expression of the marker protein repp-86 (detected with Ki-S2) and it is no longer absent throughout the G₁ phase. Such drastically shortened G₁ phases (as little as 10% of the total cell cycle) were never observed in normal tissues, not even in very fast proliferating germ or bone marrow cells [124]. This means, that aggressive tumors are primarily characterized by cells with a deregulated cell cycle that have elevated telomerase activity, this is not evident in a higher fraction of proliferating cells, as determined with the classical marker Ki-67. In addition, quantitative relations should be considered. The Ki-S2/Ki-S5 ratios differed about four-fold, between 0.2 and 0.9, whereas telomerase levels varied more than 100-fold.

Although elevated telomerase activity (not telomerase positivity *per se*) correlated significantly with classic prognostic factors of carcinoma (histologic FIGO stage and FIGO grade) and was associated with tumor recurrence (5 of 53 patients), whereas no events occurred in the group with low telomerase activity, a longer follow-up period (beyond 39 months) is required to confirm its significance, especially in combination with the now available proliferation markers Ki-S5 and Ki-S2.

Due to its high sensitivity, the TRAP assay can be performed with a small number of cells. This assay was shown to be superior to cytologic examination
of pancreatic duct cells [125] or peritoneal fluids from patients with ovarian carcinoma [126; reviewed by McKenzie in ref. 120]. This could increase the value of minimal-invasive sampling procedures in the early evaluation of suspected cancer or detection of minimal residual disease. Repeated monitoring would be reasonable for following the antiproliferative effect of tumor therapies and of subsequent, potential tumor recurrence. The feasibility of the approach was shown with a model system, radiocuring of tumors in nude mice [127]. Potential practical applications are exfoliated urinary cells from urological neoplasias [128], fine-needle aspirates from breast cancer patients [112] or hysteroscopy in endometrioid carcinoma, which requires consideration of the hormonal status of the patient [83]. See also the extensive compilation in the review by McKenzie et al. [120].

### 1.1. Detection of telomerase: Experimental considerations

The initial format of TRAP, the PCR-based telomerase assay, had some problematic features which were resolved later: (i) Variable amounts of PCR inhibitors in tumor samples can be identified by the coamplification of an internal amplification standard, ITAS, and more reliable quantitative comparisons were possible [84,129]. (ii) Telomerase products contain only one unique primer sequence, the reverse primer still consists of repetitive DNA, and false positive results were obtained due to template slippage on PCR-derived primer dimers. The introduction of extended reverse primers eliminated this problem and a simplified protocol was possible (Fig. 3) [100,130]. (iii) Different tumor entities contain substantial and highly variable RNase activities, which are destructive to the ribonucleoprotein enzyme telomerase [131–133]. With a sensitive and quantitative, fluorescence-based RNase assay it was shown that the suggested proteinous RNase inhibitor RNasin [132] provides only limited protection, which was improved by including the more universal inhibitors “VRC” (vanadyl ribonucleotide complex) and “ATA” (aurintricarboxylic acid) [133]. Several of these improvements have been implemented in commercially available kits from Oncor/Appligene (gel assay) or Boehringer/Roche-Diagnostics (high throughput ELISA format, but lacking the normalizing option of a coamplified ITAS). However, these assays require the analysis of fresh or flash-frozen (liquid nitrogen) samples and handling is not without experimental challenges. Furthermore, they are limited to the analysis of lysates and *in situ* analysis which preserves cell morphology would be highly preferential. Although some success with an *in situ* TRAP assay was reported [134], quantitative comparisons are — at least — problematic.

A possible alternative is the direct detection of enzyme subunits. Cloning efforts yielded the genes for the RNA component [35] and a telomerase associated protein, the human homolog of p80 from *Tetrahymena thermophila* telomerase [37,38]. However, both components are not strictly linked to telomerase activity and not suitable for quantitative comparisons. More recently, the cDNA of hTERT, the catalytic protein component has been characterized and initial data have shown a good correlation of mRNA levels with telomerase activity [41-44]. This linkagewas questioned in subsequent studies, which have shown that several splicing variants [44] are functionally defective [135]. But even considering these results, fully functional hTERT mRNA is expressed in lymphocytes, irrespective of telomerase levels [136] and in normal, telomerase-negative tissues, like human brain, heart, liver, prostate, ovary, and primary fibroblasts [137]. These data suggest post-transcriptional control, and further complications arose from findings that protein phosphorylation stimulates telomerase activity [138–140]. Large-scale sampling with immunohistochemical detection of the catalytic protein subunit as the preferred format may help in resolving these issues. However, in spite of some success with polyclonal antibodies [141], no highly specific monoclonal antibodies for reliable analysis of paraffin-embedded thin sections are available yet. With these presently unresolved issues, direct detection of telomerase activity with the TRAP assay remains the only reliable quantitative method for the detection of this marker enzyme.

### II. Telomerase inhibitors in tumor therapy

Therapy with telomerase inhibitors should be less deleterious than conventional chemotherapy with its immediate attack on all proliferating cells. Effects of telomerase inhibition are delayed since they require a critical shortening of telomeres before growth arrest and cell death occurs. An increased specificity can be expected, because the reservoir of telomerase-competent but quiescent stem cells is unaffected. Furthermore, also the actively proliferating progenitor cells are much less vulnerable than tumor cells, which have very short telomeres and thus reduced proliferative life span. Promising candidates are colorectal [53] and ovarian carcinoma [49], where samples from many patients displayed telomere lengths with only half the value of normal reference tissue [reviewed by Bacchetti in ref. 142]. A suggested therapy regime [119] could combine conventional steps to reduce tumor mass, followed by a recovery period to permit transient high levels of stem cell proliferation (replacement of damaged regenerating tissues) and their return to quiescence. The final antitelomerase treatment would hit actively proliferating tumor cells and limit their proliferative capacity, thus preventing tumor relapse (Fig. 9). An anticipated, severe side effect of systemic application of telomerase inhibitors would be the erosion of telomeres in the continuously fast proliferating sperm cells. This damage may be irreversible, as anticipated from results with the cloned sheep “Dolly” [143], where passage of somatic nuclei through oocytes did not restore the original telomere length. Thus, at least in males, localized treatments seem mandatory. In contrast to these findings, Lanza et al. [224] observed a substantial telomere elongation after passage of nuclei from senescent bovine fibroblasts, resulting in telomere lengths exceeding even those of newborn normal calves. The authors discuss several possible reasons for these differences, the use of different species (sheep vs. cow), cell types (sheep mammary cells vs. bovine senescent fibroblasts) or alterations in the technical procedures.

For effective antitelomerase treatment, absence of telomerase must really limit

Fig. 9. Envisioned effects of tumor therapy with telomerase inhibitors. Fast proliferating germ cells (sperm cells) would suffer, whereas the only transiently activated stem cells would remain largely unaffected. They would also soon replace the affected progenitor cells, and derived somatic tissues. Tumor cells with already shorter telomeres would shorten even faster, leading to irreversible growth arrest and cell death. This figure was reproduced from ref. 223.

the cellular proliferative capacity. Initial data with antisense constructs against the human telomerase RNA component support this notion [35]. Furthermore, only very few cells may escape this limitation with an alternative mechanism for telomere maintenance. A recombination-based telomerase independent mechanism is well documented for unicellular yeast [144] and also several in vitro experiments with human cell lines suggest the existence of an alternative mechanism [145–148]. On the other hand, telomerase negative mice [149] with critically shortened telomeres (their initial, extreme length required more than five generations) displayed severe defects in regenerative tissues [150], suggesting that escape from telomerase dependent telomere maintenance is not frequent enough to prevent these in vivo defects (see also section future perspectives).

The list of already known telomerase inhibitors includes normal cytostatic drugs that also act on cellular polymerases, like nucleotide analogs [151–154], cisplatin [155] and tea catechins [156,157]. The advent of antisense technology enables target-specific design of antisense oligonucleotides, combined with nuclease-stabilization by 2′-O-methyl-ribose [158], or phosphorothioates [159,160], or by including a catalytic ribozyme motif [161,162]. A completely altered backbone is provided with peptide nucleic acids “PNA” [148,163] and initial problems with cellular delivery may have been solved [164]. Although the promiscuous protein-

binding properties of phosphorothioate-modified oligonucleotides is a determinant of their telomerase inhibition [160] and thus limits the target-specificity, some data of their promising *in vivo* effects in nude mice models have been reported [159]. The unique G:G interaction in telomere G-quartet structures seems another good target. Telomerase was inhibited both, by structural interference with the nucleoside analog 7-deaza-guanosine [165,166] and by conditions which stabilize the quartet structure [19]. Especially promising are low molecular weight inhibitors with quartet stabilizing effects, like alterperlylenol [167,168], amidoanthracene-diones [169] or dicarbocyanine [170]. Also unbiased screening programs keep promise in identifying synthetic moieties like benzo[b]thiophenes [171] or natural compounds, like a polysaccharide from the marine microalga *Gymnodinium* [172]. In the near future, the powerful approach of modern combinatorial chemistry [173] will be applied to promising, albeit still unsatisfactory lead structures, and this may yield compounds for practical tests of the ever hopeful telomerase inhibitor therapy.

### III. Elongated life spans of cells

Two different experimental approaches are outlined which may offer this potential. Preliminary reports with yeast [174] and recently with human cell lines [175] suggest that telomere elongation and significantly extended cellular proliferation capacity can be achieved with a relatively simple treatment with unmodified phosphodiester oligonucleotides of the sequence (TTAGGG)₂ or variants thereof [175]. A more demanding option is the introduction and expression of the gene for the catalytic telomerase component. This genomic manipulation induced telomerase activity in previously telomerase negative cells and resulted in a drastically expanded life-span of human epithelial cells [176]. So far no changes were found which would suggest that these “immortalized” cells have gained a carcinogenic potential [177,178], but results from more rigorous tests are still lacking [179]. Furthermore, a severe technical problem became evident with the findings that for certain cell types, telomerase gene expression and even established telomerase activity (as determined with the *in vitro* TRAP assay) is not sufficient for cellular immortalization [180-182]. Re-setting the mitotic clock seems a more demanding challenge than anticipated. Even the passage of somatic nuclei with shortened telomeres through oocytes was insufficient for restoring full-length telomeres. This can be concluded from reported “aged telomere ends” in the sheep “Dolly” that had been derived from *in vitro* expanded somatic cells [143]. However, these results should not be generalized. Different from the data with sheep, Lanza et al. [224] observed a substantial telomere elongation after cloning via oocyte passage of nuclei from senescent bovine fibroblasts, resulting in telomere lengths exceeding even those of newborn normal calves.

If technical problems were solved, a useful application could be based on very early observations. The proliferation potential of blood cells is gradually decreasing (erosion of telomeres) with increasing age of the donor [53,57]. This suggested that telomerase activity *per se* in the hematopoietic stem cells is insufficient to maintain
stable telomere lengths [66]. An immediate outcome is a potential problem in bone-marrow transplants, which require a massive expansion (proliferation) of stem cells. Even allogeneic transplants display 0.4 kb shorter telomeres, which is equivalent to a median of 15 years ageing [183,184]. This problem is more pronounced with a young recipient and an old donor. But at least there is an age window with minor effects. Rapid telomere length decline in leukocytes was restricted to children until age 4, then followed by an almost constant plateau phase until mid-twenties and a gradual attrition later in life [185,186]. In certain situations it may be advantageous to elongate telomeres *ex vivo* before transplantation. The technical advances in transplantation of lab-grown tissues or even complete organs [187,188] represent a similar challenge, since they include a step with expansion of somatic cells.

A mere *in vitro* application could be the immortalization of “primary” human cells for better tissue culture models, maybe useful for the isolation of products which are intractable or completely shut-off in conventional cell lines. A very rewarding challenge is the replacement of the complex hybridoma technology with the chance to produce purely human monoclonal antibodies from immortalized B lymphocytes.

## Future perspectives

### Is the mitotic clock relevant for normal cellular senescence in vivo and for organismic ageing?

This is a matter of debate [179,189-192]. The pathogenesis with severe defects in highly proliferative tissues of telomerase negative mice [150] is an artificial system. In normal organisms, other ageing mechanisms have prime importance and may override before telomere-dependant proliferative limitations can become important. They are evident in ageing of mice with “unlimiting” telomere lengths or in signals from reproductive system which influence the lifespan of the nematode *Caenorhabditis elegans* [193]. Probably, the slow rates of senescence in indeterminately growing metazoa are not an immediate consequence of, but they clearly require the maintenance of high cellular proliferation potential, brought about by high telomerase activity [101].

### What regulates telomerase activity?

Transcriptional activation of the catalytic subunit hTERT by c-Myc is well documented [194,195] and possibly involved in development of skin tumors [196]. Knowledge of the hTERT promoter structure may reveal more of a regulatory network. But the initially suggested tight linkage of telomerase activity and expression of the catalytic component hTERT [41-44,136] did not hold in further analyses of tissue samples, at least not at the level of expressed mRNA, even if inactivated splicing variants are considered [137]. Clearly, post-transcriptionaland post-splicing steps are involved, and activation by phosphorylation with kinase Cα [139] and/or Akt protein kinase [140] is even beyond translational control. However, regulatory effects of phosphorylation seem only quantitative (no on/off switch) and quantitative correlation of hTERT protein level and telomerase activity is poorly documented for normal telomerase positive and negative tissues. Accessory regulatory factors in the telomerase complex are not known (not yet?). Clearly, telomere binding proteins are important in controlling the length of and access of telomerase to the chromosomal telomeres [24], but we still know very little about the linkage of *in vitro* detected telomerase and its function *in vivo*. The extremely high telomerase activity in fish liver is compelling and not understood. The signaling pathway which links cellular proliferation to telomerase activity remains enigmatic.

### Immunohistochemical detection of telomerase components in paraffin-embedded thin sections

At present the specificity of polyclonal antibody preparations is limited [141], and even with fresh tissue samples, the preferred, and reliable cellular localization of hTERT by immunohistochemical analysis is elusive. Highly specific monoclonal antibodies for analyzing paraffin-embedded thin sections would be the ideal tool for clinical studies and would allow a broad range of retrospective analysis of samples from patients with known pathogenesis. These studies may help to distinguish if tumor samples with high telomerase activity are enriched in telomerase positive tumor cells or if telomerase levels are elevated in individual tumor cells.

### Telomerase functions other than telomere maintenance?

In many examples, high telomerase activity correlated with frequent recurrence of disease in cancer patients. These observations were not only linked to high proliferation rates and a deregulated cell cycle [85], but also to failure of and resistance to chemotherapy [108, 197]. Several cytostatic drugs cause chromosome breaks and in the resistance mechanism, telomerase may have a function in DNA repair. At least in yeast, the same proteins are shared in repair of double strand breaks and in telomere maintenance [198]. Understanding the detailed interplay of both functions could advance prediction and fighting of chemoresistance.

### What prevents erosion and dysfunction of telomeres?

Telomerase activity *per se* (at least determined with the *in vitro* assay) is definitely not sufficient [180–182]. It is known that the human telomeric protein TRF1 is involved in the control of telomere length [24] and for protists it has been shown that mutations in the telomerase RNA template region can result in telomere shortening, as observed in *Tetrahymena* [199] or in runaway replication of very large telomeres in yeast [200]. Even long telomeres cannot prevent chromosome
fusions if they lack short single stranded extensions, which are required for TRF2 interaction [25]. In human carcinogenesis or chromosomal aberrations, nothing is known about the involvement of mutants in human genes for telomere-associated proteins or for components of the telomerase complex.

**How many different mechanisms for telomere maintenance?**

Presently known alternatives (i) standard telomeres with short repeats are maintained by the ribonucleoprotein enzyme telomerase, (ii) recombination as a rare rescue function in yeast, possibly also humans, (iii) in the maintenance of long retroposons in *Drosophila* reverse transcriptase and RNA template are separate entities. The insect *Bombyx mori* is exceptional with short repeats, but failed attempts to identify a primer-dependent telomerase in larvae, cell lines, pupae or imagines [201, 202]. Is *Bombyx* an example for recombination as the major pathway?

Taking a different route and a lesson from the fossil analog tRNA nucleotidyl transferase, a telomerase protein enzyme seems feasible which can add short sequence repeats and does not require a nucleic acid template. In which organisms are chromosomal ends maintained by such an archetype telomerase?

**Telomerase inhibitors in tumor therapy: promise or threat?**

Effects of complete telomerase suppression on the organism level can be studied in the knock-out mouse model (homozygous mTR-/– with deleted telomerase RNA gene) [reviewed in ref. 203]. No immediate effects were evident, even tumor development was unaffected. This was not unexpected, since this mouse strain had very long telomeres, thus providing a buffer against telomere erosion in the absence of telomerase activity. Telomere length declined over successive generations, ultimately (G6 animals) resulting in cellular defects anticipated for telomere attrition, the reduced proliferative capacity and apoptotic cell death was evident in defective spermatogenesis and hematopoiesis [150].

However, in contrast to expectation, these mice had not lost the ability to develop tumors; they even had a slightly increased frequency of spontaneous tumor development, compared to wild-type control mice [204]. These findings are one anticipated consequence of telomere loss, namely increase of chromosome fusions and of general genomic instability. But in normal cells, these effects would be less evident because critically shortened telomeres would trigger checkpoint functions that lead to cell death by apoptosis. It appears that elimination of these functions was an early step in the development of these tumor cells. In this setting, telomere loss and chromosomal damage are tolerated and thus actually drive tumor development. The lesson from these findings is that telomerase inhibition could be mutagenic in tumor cells, especially if checkpoints were deleted, like in p53 mutants [205]. But on the other hand, increased mutation rates are a common side effect of most cancer therapeutics; and in a clinical setting, a transient therapy with telomerase inhibitors would be envisioned. In this case, growth limitation of already established tumors

is in focus, and achieving this goal may outweigh a slight increase in spontaneous tumor development.
