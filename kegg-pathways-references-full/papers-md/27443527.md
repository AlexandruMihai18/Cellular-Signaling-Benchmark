Abstract

Mitochondria are the powerhouses for the cell, consuming oxygen to generate sufficient energy for the maintenance of normal cellular processes. However, a deleterious consequence of this process are reactive oxygen species generated as side-products of these reactions. As a means to protect mitochondria from damage, cells and mitochondria have developed a wide-range of mitochondrial quality control mechanisms that remove damaged mitochondrial cargo, enabling the mitochondria to repair the damage and ultimately restore their normal function. If the damage is extensive and mitochondria can no longer be repaired, a process termed mitophagy is initiated in which the mitochondria are directed for autophagic clearance. Canonical mitophagy is regulated by two proteins, PINK1 and Parkin, which are mutated in familial forms of Parkinson’s disease. In this review, we discuss recent work elucidating the mechanism of PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy, along with recently uncovered PINK1/Parkin-independent mitophagy pathways. Moreover, we describe a novel mitochondrial quality control pathway, involving mitochondrial-derived vesicles that direct distinct and damaged mitochondrial cargo for degradation in the lysosome. Finally, we discuss the association between mitochondrial quality control, cardiac, hepatic and neurodegenerative disease and discuss the possibility of targeting these pathways for therapeutic purposes.

# Introduction

An evolutionary event several billion years ago resulted in the endosymbiosis of an α-proteobacteria and a pre-eukaryotic cell, which gave rise to a new type of organelle, termed the mitochondria (Archibald, 2015). These organelles are essential for eukaryotic cells to grow and function normally, with mitochondria acting as the energy powerhouses of the cell. Through an oxygen-dependent reaction, mitochondria generate energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is required for nearly every major cellular function. In addition to their role as energy producers, mitochondria play a critical role in a host of other cellular processes required for the maintenance of cellular homeostasis, including regulating calcium stores and as an initiator of apoptosis. They also function as a scaffold for cellular metabolic events including iron-sulfur cluster biogenesis, amino acid synthesis and lipid metabolism (Aoun and Tiranti, 2015; Bhola and Letai, 2016). Given their integral role in these processes, it is not surprising that the maintenance of healthy mitochondria is essential for the cell to survive and function normally. Yet, when mitochondria generate ATP through the electron transport chain (ETC) in a stepwise reaction that consumes oxygen, toxic by-products are a secondary consequence of this reaction. This makes the mitochondrion a major site for the generation of cellular reactive oxidative species (ROS), which are damaging to proteins, lipids and whose presence when left to accumulate can be damaging to mitochondria (Shadel and Horvath, 2015). Since defective mitochondria can be deleterious to neighbouring mitochondria by making yet more ROS in a “vicious cycle” of oxidative damage, mitochondria have developed multiple surveillance mechanisms to eliminate damaged mitochondrial cargo, and if beyond repair, the removal of the mitochondrion in its entirety.

Mitochondria are dynamic doubled membrane organelles that can protect themselves from minor damage by redistributing their contents through cycles of fusion/fission or by an intraorganellar quality control mechanism called the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPR<sup>mt</sup>). The mitochondrial compartment is replete with chaperone proteins that assist in the proper folding of its components, in addition to a number of proteases responsible for targeted protein quality control that resemble pathways observed in prokaryotes (Lon proteases and AAA+ family proteases) (Jovaisaite and Auwerx, 2015; Voos, 2013; Voos et al., 2013). The majority of mitochondrial proteins are encoded by the nucleus, and these proteases are involved in degrading superfluous respiratory chain subunits in order to ensure their correct stoichiometry and for maintaining the mitochondrial protein-folding environment. If the cell senses mitochondrial dysfunction, it can activate the UPR<sup>mt</sup> pathway to alleviate mitochondrial stress by increasing the transcription of mitochondrial chaperones (Hsp60, Hsp70) and proteases (Aldridge et al., 2007; Zhao et al., 2002), in parallel with the expression of genes involved in protein homeostasis and anti-oxidant pathways such as mitochondrial superoxide dismutase and glutathione (Papa and Germain, 2014; Zhao et al., 2002). Together, these processes stabilize the mitochondria by preventing the accumulation of misfolded or potentially toxic proteins caused by ROS and maintain protein homeostasis required for optimal mitochondrial function. However, if the damage surpasses a threshold limit resulting in the disruption of the membrane potential across the inner mitochondrial membrane, the removal of the entire dysfunctional mitochondria is initiated via the autophagy pathway, in a process termed mitophagy. In this review, we will discuss the emerging mechanisms of mitochondrial quality control, focusing on the pathways of mitophagy and

mitochondrial-derived vesicles (MDVs) (Figure 1), and outline the implications of these processes in human disease.

## Mitochondria fission/fusion

Mitochondrial fission and fusion processes are critical for maintaining a healthy mitochondrial network. The mitochondrial fusion proteins mitofusin 1 (MFN1) and mitofusin 2 (MFN2) are transmembrane GTPases that were identified as the primary regulators of mitochondrial fusion (Koshiba et al., 2004). Both proteins interact via either homotypic or heterotypic interactions, with MFN1 or MFN2 localizing to the outer membrane of a neighboring mitochondrion to mediate fusion, through a process that is dependent on their GTPase activity (Chen et al., 2003). MFN1 and MFN2 are required for fusion of the outer mitochondrial membranes, while Opa1 mediates fusion of the inner membranes. Opa1 is a dynamin-like GTPase localizing to the inner mitochondrial membrane that is alternatively spliced to give rise to eight isoforms (Olichon et al., 2007). These isoforms may then be cleaved to form short forms of Opa1, which lack a transmembrane domain but are still associated with the inner mitochondrial membrane (Ishihara et al., 2006). It remains controversial whether short forms of Opa1 are capable of mediating membrane fusion and whether the short and long forms of Opa1 act in concert to mediate inner mitochondrial membrane fusion (Griparic et al., 2007; Ishihara et al., 2006; Song et al., 2007).

In contrast, fission (along with the suppression of fusion) is essential for the generation of new mitochondria or the isolation of damaged mitochondrial segments. This process is regulated by dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1), a GTPase in the dynamin super family of proteins. Drp1 recognizes sites of ER-mitochondrial contact during mitochondrial division and helps define fission site within the mitochondrial network (Friedman et al., 2011). Together with the protein fission 1 (Fis1), mitochondrial fission factor (Mff), and the mitochondrial dynamics proteins of 49 and 51 kDa (MiD49/51), Drp1 forms a ring-shaped structure which encircles and constricts the mitochondrial tubular structure to induce mitochondrial fission and isolate the damaged mitochondrial compartments (Loson et al., 2013).

## PINK1 and Parkin: Partners in mitochondrial quality control

Once damaged compartments have been isolated, the process of mitophagy mediates their removal. In recent years, it has become clear that two Parkinson’s disease (PD)-associated proteins: Parkin and PINK1, are central to this process. Initial studies in *Drosophila melanogaster* provided the first evidence that PINK1 could act upstream of Parkin and that both proteins function together in a common mitochondrial quality control pathway (Clark et al., 2006; Park et al., 2006). Parkin overexpression could rescue mitochondrial defects in PINK1 null flies, whereas PINK1 overexpression had no effect on the Parkin phenotype. These *Drosophila* studies suggested that PINK1 and Parkin functioned in the same pathway, with PINK1 acting upstream of Parkin.

PINK1 is a mitochondrial serine/threonine protein kinase that contains an N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS) (Takatori et al., 2008). Under normal conditions, the
protein levels of PINK1 are low as a result of its cleavage by mitochondrial proteases and subsequent degradation via the N-end rule pathway (Yamano and Youle, 2013). In untreated cells, three forms of PINK1 are observed: a 64-kDa full-length form and two cleaved fragments (60- and 52-kDa) (Greene et al., 2012; Jin et al., 2010). Due to its N-terminal MTS, PINK1 is constitutively imported into the mitochondria via the Translocase of outer membrane (TOM) and Translocase of inner membrane (TIM) complex. Once imported, the MTS of full length PINK1 is cleaved to generate a 60-kDa cleaved isoform. This first cleavage step is associated with binding of PINK1 to the mitochondrial processing peptidase (MPP). Next, the 60-kDa fragment of PINK1 is further cleaved by a combination of Presenilin-associated Rhomboid protease (PARL) and AFG3L2, giving rise to a 52-kDa processed fragment that is exported to the cytosol where it is rapidly degraded by the proteasome (Greene et al., 2012; Jin et al., 2010). Through this pathway of successive proteolytic cleavages, basal levels of PINK1 levels remain low to prevent the aberrant mitophagy of healthy mitochondria.

Since the mitochondrial import of PINK1 requires an active proton gradient, depolarization of mitochondria impedes this process, resulting in the accumulation of PINK1 on the outer surface of depolarized mitochondria (Lazarou et al., 2012). In the absence of mitochondrial depolarization, overwhelming the import channels by over expressing PINK1 can also lead to its mitochondrial accumulation (Narendra, D.P. et al., 2010). More recently, it has been demonstrated that knockdown of specific mitochondrial proteases, which cleave PINK1, can also lead to its accumulation on mitochondria (Greene et al., 2012). When PINK1 accumulates on the surface of the mitochondria, its kinase domain faces into the cytoplasm, enabling it to phosphorylate both mitochondrial and cytosolic proteins (Zhou et al., 2008). The resulting accumulation of full-length PINK1 elicits Parkin recruitment onto the mitochondria (Narendra, D.P. et al., 2010), and it is the mitochondrial accumulation of PINK1 rather than a loss in membrane potential that is essential for Parkin recruitment. The kinase activity of PINK1 is required for Parkin recruitment, as an accumulation of a kinase-dead form of PINK1 on the outer surface of depolarized mitochondria fails to elicit the recruitment of Parkin from the cytoplasm (Geisler et al., 2010a; Narendra, D.P. et al., 2010). Thus, the accumulation of active PINK1 on mitochondria is an essential first step for the recruitment and activation of Parkin onto damaged mitochondria.

Under basal conditions, Parkin exists as an autoinhibited E3 ubiquitin (Ub)-ligase that is a member of the RING1-InBetweenRING-RING2 (RBR) family of E3s. As an RBR-type E3, Parkin simultaneously binds to the E2 Ub-conjugating enzyme and its substrate, using a RING/HECT hybrid mechanism to facilitate the transfer of Ub via a thioester intermediate (Wenzel et al., 2011). Structural studies have revealed that the autoinhibited conformation Parkin adopts has several distinct interactions that keep it in this inactive state. Firstly, the Ub-like (Ubl) domain is bound to RING1 such that Ser65 is poorly accessible for phosphorylation by PINK1. Secondly, the Repressor Element of Parkin (REP) blocks the E2 Ub-conjugating enzymes from binding to the RING1 domain. Finally, the RING0 domain binds to RING2 in such a way that it occludes the Cys431 ubiquitin acceptor site (Riley et al., 2013; Spratt et al., 2013; Trempe et al., 2013; Wauer and Komander, 2013). The introduction of mutations within Parkin to abolish any of these interactions (W403A, F146A, RING0 deletion) causes a dramatic increase in Parkin autoubiquitination (Trempe et al., 2013). In particular, the W403A mutation facilitates the removal of the REP and favors the binding of the E2 enzyme UbcH7, which leads to enhanced recruitment

5of Parkin onto depolarized mitochondria (Trempe et al., 2013). In contrast, the T240R mutation in the E2-binding site on RING1 abolishes Ubch7 binding and strongly impairs Parkin recruitment onto the mitochondria (Geisler et al., 2010a; Matsuda et al., 2010; Trempe et al., 2013). These structural studies have provided great insights into the mechanisms of Parkin activation and mitochondrial recruitment.

### PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy

Until recently, a major unresolved question in the field was the mechanism by which PINK1 elicits the recruitment of Parkin onto damaged mitochondria. The first insight into how PINK1 promotes this process came from studies in which PINK1 was demonstrated to phosphorylate Parkin directly at Ser65 in its N-terminal Ubl domain (Kondapalli et al., 2012; Shiba-Fukushima et al., 2012). Ser65 is a residue conserved in Ub, and surprisingly PINK1 was demonstrated in several studies to phosphorylate Ub at this conserved residue (Kane et al., 2014; Kazlauskaite et al., 2014; Koyano et al., 2014). Remarkably, phosphorylated Ub (p-Ub) binds directly to a pocket around the H302 residue within Parkin, initiating a cascade that switches on Parkin (Kazlauskaite et al., 2015; Kazlauskaite and Muqit, 2015). Through direct binding with p-Ub, the Ubl of Parkin becomes accessible for PINK1-mediated phosphorylation, initiating the release of Parkin inhibitory interactions, enabling Parkin to adopt an active “open” conformation (Sauve et al., 2015). In the context of mitophagy, we propose that accumulation of PINK1 on the mitochondria induces an initial round of phosphorylation on the Ub conjugated at basal levels to mitochondrial substrates (Figure 2). At the same time, PINK1 is free to phosphorylate free Ub spread throughout the cytoplasm. Parkin can interact with both free p-Ub and p-Ub chains conjugated to substrates, leading to a conformational change that opens up Parkin for direct PINK1-mediated phosphorylation on its Ubl (Koyano et al., 2014; Okatsu et al., 2015; Sauve et al., 2015; Shiba-Fukushima et al., 2014).

The binding of p-Ub to Parkin and the phosphorylation of the Ubl derepress the basally autoinhibited E3 Ub-ligase activity of Parkin, triggering the formation of Ub conjugates on a wide range of mitochondrial substrates (Liang et al., 2015; Ordureau et al., 2015). Following their ubiquitination, the mitochondrial fusion proteins MFN1 and MFN2 are rapidly degraded via the proteasome (Chan et al., 2011) thereby inhibiting mitochondrial fusion. Ub chains present on other substrates not destined for proteasomal degradation can be further phosphorylated by PINK1, with the increased levels of p-Ub chains further amplifying the translocation of Parkin and its ubiquitination of mitochondrial substrates (Lazarou et al., 2013; Matsuda et al., 2010). In parallel with promoting the recruitment of Parkin, the ubiquitination of mitochondrial substrates also helps to recruit adaptor proteins for directing damaged mitochondria into newly formed autophagosomes (Heo et al., 2015). Adaptor proteins that include NDP52, NBR1, optineurin, TAX1PB1, and P62/SQSTM1 have a high affinity for polyUb chains and LC3, an autophagic protein found on the outer-membrane of newly formed autophagosomes. P62/SQSTM1 binds to ubiquitinated substrates on the mitochondria, directing them into newly forming autophagic vesicles by binding LC3 (Geisler et al., 2010a; Narendra, D. et al., 2010). Recently, it was shown that mitochondrial damage activates the kinase TBK1, which phosphorylates optineurin, NDP52,and p62/SQSTM1 (Heo et al., 2015) (Figure 2). Although optineurin binds poorly to phosphorylated Ub conjugates (Heo et al., 2015), the phosphorylation of optineurin by TBK1 enhances its ability to bind to ubiquitinated chains (Gleason et al., 2011). Moreover, TBK1-mediated phosphorylation of optineurin and p62/SQSTM1 enhances their binding to LC3 and Ub, respectively (Heo et al., 2015; Lazarou et al., 2015). Interestingly, experiments using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing to knockout five autophagic adaptors either alone or in combination implicated NDP52 and optineurin, and to a lesser extent TAXBP1, as the major adaptors in Parkin/PINK1-mediated mitophagy (Heo et al., 2015; Lazarou et al., 2015). The generation of the pre-autophagosomal isolation membrane is regulated by TBCD15, a mitochondrial Rab GTPase-activating protein (Rab-GAP) (Yamano et al., 2014), and the mitochondrial outer membrane protein Fis1 (Shen et al., 2014). Once the autophagy adaptors complete the capture of damaged mitochondria within the autophagosome, it fuses with the lysosome and empties its contents into the lysosome interior where the mitochondrion is degraded by lysosomal proteases. Taken together, the combined efforts of Parkin, PINK1 and a range of autophagic adaptors, all function within this defined mitophagy pathway to mediate the removal of dysfunctional mitochondria, a process that is essential to maintain a healthy population of mitochondria.

### PINK1/Parkin-independent mitophagy

The PINK1/Parkin mitophagy pathway has received considerable attention due to the association of PINK1 and Parkin in familial cases of PD. However, other mechanisms that govern the fate damaged mitochondria clearly exist as humans and animals with PINK1 or Parkin mutations do not have increased mitochondrial mass. It remains known whether alternative mitophagy pathways are upregulated in response to a loss of PINK1 or Parkin function, but such an upregulation could explain the lack of neurodegenerative phenotypes in PINK1 or Parkin null mice.

In order to allow the engulfment of mitochondria by the autophagosome, mitophagy receptors, which contain an LC3 interacting region (LIR), must be recruited to the mitochondrial surface. Recent evidence has demonstrated that PINK1 alone can be sufficient to mediate the recruitment of two such adaptors, Optineurin and NDP52, to the mitochondria independently of Parkin (Lazarou et al., 2015). Along this same line of evidence, a recent report identified a Parkin-independent mitophagy receptor Bcl2-L-13, the mammalian homologue of Atg32, which can promote the removal of depolarized mitochondria in response to CCCP treatment in the absence of Parkin (Murakawa et al., 2015). However, it is not yet defined whether PINK1 is required for this process or how Bcl2-L-13 recruitment onto mitochondria occurs. Strappazzon and colleagues identified another Parkin-independent mitophagy pathway that utilizes AMBRA1, another LIR-containing protein, and which occurs independently of PINK1 (Strappazzon et al., 2015). AMBRA1, a positive regulator of Beclin1, has previously been shown to interact with Parkin to enhance mitochondrial clearance (Van Humbeeck et al., 2011). However, using an AMBRA1 construct with alanine mutations at key residues in its LIR (W1019A-L1022A), Strappazzon and
colleagues show that the interaction between mutant AMBRA1 and LC3 is abolished and mitophagy is not induced, indicating that the AMBRA1-LC3 interaction is crucial for this type of mitophagy to occur following treatment with specific depolarizing agents.

There have been other reports of Parkin-independent mitophagy for which the mechanism are less clear, although we cannot rule out the possibility that Bcl2-L-13 or AMBRA1 may be mediating mitophagy in these cases (Kageyama et al., 2014; Sterky et al., 2011). For instance, when Sterky and colleagues crossed the MitoPark mice – a specific deletion of the mitochondrial transcription factor A in dopaminergic neurons – with the Parkin knockout mice, the progressive parkinsonism and the accumulation of damaged mitochondria characteristics of the MitoPark was unchanged, suggesting that the loss of Parkin had no effect on the degenerative phenotype of the MitoPark mice. In addition, overexpression of Parkin did not result in the recruitment of Parkin to the mitochondria, suggesting that Parkin did not promote the removal of damaged mitochondria. Thus, other mechanisms that have evolved to promote the removal of mitochondria independent of Parkin and PINK1 have yet to be uncovered.

## Mitochondrial quality control stimuli

To advance our understanding of mitochondrial quality control pathways, it is essential that we identify a distinct range of stimuli that can elicit mitochondrial damage to activate one or more of these pathways. In the mitophagy field, the uncoupling agents CCCP or FCCP are two of the most commonly used agents, although it is unlikely they are representative of physiological mitochondrial quality control, as they induce the clearance of the mitochondrial network in its entirety (Table 1). Therefore, screens to identify novel stimuli are crucial to tease out these complex mitophagic pathways. Allen et al undertook such a screen and identified a loss of iron as a potent inducer of PINK1/Parkin-independent mitophagy (Allen et al., 2013). Further studies confirmed the notion of iron starvation-induced mitophagy in *C. elegans* and in mammalian cells (Kirienko et al., 2015; Schiavi et al., 2015). It was demonstrated that moderate iron depletion and the subsequent activation of mitophagy can increase longevity in *C. elegans* (Schiavi et al., 2015) and confer protection against *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* infection in *C. elegans* (Kirienko et al., 2015). These findings are especially interesting given that iron is known to accumulate in the brains of patients with neurodegenerative diseases such as Friedrich’s ataxia and Parkinson’s disease. Thus, it will be interesting to elucidate the effect of high iron levels on mitophagy. Will mitophagy be inhibited in the presence of high concentrations of iron and could this contribute to neurodegeneration? Dissection of the mechanisms at play in PINK1/Parkin-independent mitophagy will help further our understanding of mitochondrial quality control and how these pathways could be targeted as therapeutic strategies as an alternative to the PINK1/Parkin-dependent pathway.

## Mitophagy during hypoxia
A well-established inducer of PINK1/Parkin-independent mitophagy is hypoxia, a condition under which insufficient oxygen for aerobic metabolism is available to cells. During hypoxia, the cell reverts to a glycolytic metabolic program and mitochondria are removed by mitophagy to adjust to the metabolic needs of the cell. Both NIX (Nip3-like protein X) and Bnip3 (Bcl-2 and 19 kDa interacting protein-3) are required for hypoxia-induced mitophagy (Li et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2008). While the canonical function of these proteins is to induce apoptotic cell death in response to high levels of cellular damage (Dorn, 2010), it has been shown that the expression of both NIX and Bnip3 is upregulated at the transcriptional level by HIF1 or FOXO3 under conditions of hypoxia, leading to the turnover of mitochondria by mitophagy. Following the upregulation of their expression, NIX or Bnip3 insert into the outer mitochondrial membrane as homodimers, enabling their cytoplasmic N-terminal portion to interact with LC3-related molecules via their LIR domains (Hanna et al., 2012; Schwarten et al., 2009).

A recently described receptor for hypoxia-induced mitophagy is FUN14 domain-containing protein 1 (FUNDC1). Liu et al. demonstrated that hypoxia cannot induce mitophagy in FUNDC1 silenced cells, which is ultimately rescued by the overexpression of FUNDC1 (Liu et al., 2014). FUNDC1 contains a LIR, which mediates its ability to recruit autophagosomes to mitochondria. In order to activate its mitophagic activity, ULK1 must phosphorylate FUNDC1 at serine 17 to promote the interaction of FUNDC1 with LC3 (Wu et al., 2014). Interestingly, ULK1 is stimulated to translocate to mitochondria following treatment with mitochondrial uncouplers, as well as conditions of hypoxia, and mitophagy is robustly stimulated under these conditions even in the absence of Parkin, implicating FUNDC1 as a key mitophagy receptor in Parkin-independent mitophagy (Wu et al., 2014).

## Mitochondrial-derived vesicles and mitochondrial quality control

While mitophagy can remove irreversibly damaged mitochondria, cell types that are dependent on the ETC to meet the majority of their energy requirements, such as neurons and cardiomyocytes, are unable to tolerate the removal of large portions of their mitochondrial network as a means to protect against oxidative stress. Thus, mitochondria have a widespread system of chaperones and proteases that help to repair and/or remove damaged cargo, ensuring mitochondria maintain their normal function (Matsushima and Kaguni, 2012; Neutzner et al., 2007). Essential to these defense mechanisms are mitochondrial-derived vesicles (MDVs), distinct structures that were first observed in 2008 (Neuspiel et al., 2008). This initial study identified vesicles containing mitochondrial-anchored protein ligase (MAPL) budding from the mitochondria that are transported to the peroxisome. Further studies identified a second distinct MDV pathway that shuttles damaged, oxidized cargo from the mitochondria to the lysosome for degradation, implicating MDV formation as a mitochondrial quality control mechanism (McLelland et al., 2014; Soubannier et al., 2012). Interestingly, the ancestors of mitochondria, α-proteobacteria, which underwent the endosymbiotic event, are known to shed vesicles that carry specific cargo such as virulence factors and host cell cycle arresting peptides (Deatherage and Cookson, 2012). This suggests that MDV formation is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism that has evolved for different purposes within the eukaryotic cell.Although MDVs directed to the lysosome are generated under basal conditions, oxidative stress upregulates their production. Cargo incorporation is selective and distinct MDV cargo incorporation is stimulated in response to oxidative stress produced within mitochondria compared with oxidative stress generated externally to mitochondria (Figure 3). For instance, treatment with xanthine oxidase/xanthine (XO/X), an external source of reactive oxygen species leads to the generation of single-membraned MDVs enriched in outer mitochondrial membrane proteins (TOM20 or VDAC) and lacking matrix or inner mitochondrial membrane markers (pyruvate dehydrogenase [PDH] or complex III subunit core2) Double-membraned MDVs with the opposite cargo inclusion (VDAC or TOM20 negative, PDH or core2 positive) were generated in response to antimycin A, a complex III inhibitor (McLelland et al., 2014; Soubannier et al., 2012). These observations demonstrate that MDV generation is a tightly regulated process in response to specific stimuli.

Thus far, MDVs have been studied in immortalized cell lines (including HeLa, U2OS and Cos7) and in bovine heart tissue. The MDV pathway has also been shown to occur in Arabidopsis (Yamashita et al., 2016), making it likely that MDV formation is a mechanism common to all higher eukaryotes. Moreover, MDV formation is thought to be crucial for tissues that depend heavily on a healthy mitochondrial network, such as cardiac and nervous tissue. Indirect evidence of MDV formation in the brain has been obtained using *Drosophila*, through a mass spectrometry study comparing the turnover of proteins in *pink1*, *parkin* and *atg7* mutant flies (Vincow et al., 2013). From these findings, a significant number of respiratory chain proteins were observed to have distinct half-lives in the *pink1* and *parkin* mutants, compared with the *atg7* mutants, suggestive of a mechanism in which mitochondrial proteins were turned over that is dependent on PINK1 and Parkin, but independent of mitophagy. Such findings are consistent with damaged mitochondrial proteins being degraded through the MDV pathway (McLelland et al., 2014). Indeed, PINK1 and Parkin mediate the generation of a subset of lysosomal-targeted MDVs in response to antimycin A treatment and are positive for matrix cargo such as PDH E2/E3, but are negative for the outer mitochondrial cargo, such as TOM20 (McLelland et al., 2014).

As mentioned earlier, PINK1 and Parkin are mutated in familial forms of PD and thus aberrant MDV formation may be a pathogenic mechanism. It has been shown that point mutations in Parkin that cause PD (C431F, K211N) impede the formation of MDVs. As a result, , a lack of MDVs to remove damaged cargo from mitochondria, may be deleterious for familial PD patients with these mutations. Interestingly, another PD-linked gene has also been shown to regulate the formation of MDVs. Vps35 is a component of the retromer complex that is involved in the recycling of proteins from endosomes to the trans-Golgi complex (Zimprich et al., 2004). Initial evidence pointing to a role for Vps35 in the MDV pathway demonstrated its involvement in directing MDVs to the peroxisome (Braschi et al., 2010). More recently, it has been shown to mediate the turnover of Drp1, the GTPase required for mitochondrial fission, via TOM20-positive, matrix negative MDVs targeted to the lysosome (Wang et al., 2016). The authors show that PD-linked mutations in Vps35 lead to an excessive accumulation of Drp1, resulting in a fragmented mitochondrial network. Findings on MDVs thus far suggest that they are an essential mechanism for mitochondrial quality control, offering a route through which mitochondria can remove damaged components before damage accumulates to levels above the threshold required to trigger mitophagy. Furthermore, as both types of lysosomal-directed MDVs are associated with PD-related genes, it is likely they play a significant role in the onset of these familial forms of PD, but may also be a pathway that is dysregulated in sporadic PD.

However, there are several aspects of MDV function that we know little about, and these points need to be further addressed over the coming years. Intriguingly, a recent study has demonstrated a novel role for MDVs in the regulation of autoimmunity (Matheoud et al., 2016). In this pathway, both Parkin and PINK1 actively repress the formation of a unique sub-type of antigen presenting MDV that are distinct from MDVs generated to mediate the turnover of damaged mitochondrial cargo. Formation of these MDVs, which contain high levels of mitochondrial antigens presented on MHC class I molecules, in both macrophages and dendritic cells requires the presence of Sorting nexin 9 (Snx9) and Rab9 to initiate an immune response. Thus, in addition to their role in protecting mitochondria from damage, MDVs appear to be central to immune regulation.

One of the primary functions of MDVs in mitochondrial quality control is to remove specific cargo from the mitochondrion. However, our current knowledge of the cargo incorporated into different types of MDVs is limited. Thus, it will be important to identify comprehensively the cargo carried by each type of MDV following different stimuli to fully dissect the pathways. Furthermore, there is a need to identify the machinery required for the biogenesis and trafficking of MDVs. As with any membrane trafficking pathway, specific proteins will be involved in distorting the membrane to induce the curvature of the vesicle, and the scission of the newly formed vesicle from the mitochondrion. The identity of these proteins will help us to elucidate the pathway of MDV formation. The mechanism of PINK1- and Parkin-induced MDV formation is also a key question and it will be important to understand how PINK1 is stabilized on the outer mitochondrial membrane to facilitate MDV formation. Are there specialized domains of depolarized membrane associated with damaged cargo where PINK1 can accumulate, promoting the recruitment of Parkin to these sites? Another crucial question is whether p-Ub is required for PINK1-Parkin dependent MDV formation, in an analogous mechanism to mitophagy. Finally, dissecting the kinetics of Parkin and PINK1 dissociation from the vesicle will be essential. Parkin is known to dissociate rapidly from MDVs following their formation (McLelland et al., 2014), but the reason for this is unknown. It is plausible that PINK1 is not incorporated into the vesicles, impeding Parkin from remaining associated with the MDVs once they have budded off the mitochondria. However, studying PINK1 association with MDVs has been hampered by the lack of specific antibodies against PINK1 for immunofluorescence—an issue that must be addressed either through improved antibodies or a more indirect way by introducing a tag onto the endogenous gene using CRISPR genome editing.

Another interesting possibility is that MDVs may be secreted as exosomes. Under conditions of mitochondrial stress, MDVs are directed to the lysosome for degradation. In order to reach the lysosome, MDVs can be constitutively directed via the late endosome and multi-vesicular body (MVB). MVBs contain internalised vesicles that can be secreted from the cell as exosomes when they fuse with the plasma membrane. Exosomes are small extracellular vesicles that contain proteins and RNAs that may convey specific signals between cells whose contents are perturbed in disease states. Interestingly, up to 10% of secreted cargoes in exosomes are mitochondrial in origin (Choi et al., 2013), although the pathway for the inclusion of mitochondrial

11
proteins in exosomes is unknown. If MDVs are the source of these mitochondrial proteins in exosomes, it will be fascinating to elucidate the function of their secretion as exosomes and the effect of MDV-derived exosomes on neighbouring cells. Uncovering more about the molecular mechanisms of MDV formation will provide insight into not only the physiological mitochondrial quality control but also how defects within this pathway can contribute to disease, including neurodegenerative diseases, potentially offering a novel therapeutic target.

## Mitochondrial quality control, disease and therapies

Given the importance of mitochondrial function in tissues with high energy demands, such as cardiac and nervous tissue, it is unsurprising that failure to remove damaged mitochondria, i.e. aberrant mitochondrial quality control, has been heavily implicated in cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases. Familial forms of diseases such as PD and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) have been found to result from mutations in genes linked to mitochondrial quality control. As previously discussed in this review, mutations in PINK1 or Parkin lead to an autosomal recessive early onset PD (Kitada et al., 1998; Valente et al., 2004) and these proteins are essential for canonical mitophagy (Narendra, D.P. et al., 2010). Mutations in Parkin that cause familial forms of PD can impede or abolish the normal function of Parkin in promoting mitochondrial clearance (Geisler et al., 2010b). Several of these mutations also lead to the decreased production of Parkin/PINK1-dependent MDVs, implying that defects in this pathway may also contribute to disease pathology (McLelland et al., 2014). Interestingly, mutations in the mitophagy receptors OPTN or TBK1 are implicated in ALS (Freischmidt et al., 2015; Maruyama et al., 2010), suggesting that defects within the mitophagy process may be implicated as a causative factor in different disorders. Thus, resolving the downstream pathways that lead to differential neuronal vulnerability is one of the key questions in the neurodegeneration field. The extent to which neurons rely on mitophagy to protect themselves from oxidative stress is still a controversial question, as their high energy demands results in an inability to tolerate extensive removal of the mitochondrial network. Consistent with this notion, several groups have been unable to observe mitophagy in neurons (Ashrafi et al., 2014; Bingol et al., 2014; Rakovic et al., 2013; Van Laar et al., 2011). However, it is possible that other mitochondrial quality control mechanisms are at play in neurons under basal conditions and mitophagy may become important only under high stress conditions.

The PINK1-Parkin mitophagy axis is also required for maintenance of a healthy mitochondrial population in the heart. PINK1 knockout mice develop early cardiac dysfunction and pathological cardiac hypertrophy, while in advanced human heart failure PINK1 protein levels are severely reduced (Billia et al., 2011). Parkin knockout mice do not display a cardiac phenotype under basal conditions (Kubli et al., 2013), but this is thought to be due to the compensatory upregulation of Parkin-related E3 ligases as Drosophila lack compensatory E3 ligases (Bhandari et al., 2014). In parkin null flies, dilated cardiomyopathy was observed, accompanied by enlarged mitochondria, suggesting the disease results from an accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria. As mentioned previously, Bnip3- and NIX-regulated mitophagy is important for cardiac function, as demonstrated by the cardiac phenotype in double knockout mice (Dorn, 2010).
The accumulation of damaged mitochondria has also been observed in chronic liver diseases, including alcoholic and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (Degli Esposti et al., 2012). Interestingly, ethanol consumption in rats, both chronic and non-chronic, induced the mitochondrial recruitment of Parkin and autophagic clearance of damaged mitochondria (Eid et al., 2016). The mitochondria that were degraded by mitophagy in response to ethanol consumption contained oxidatively damaged mtDNA, as demonstrated by 8-OHdG staining (Eid et al., 2016). It is yet to be elucidated how defects in this pathway, which lead to an accumulation of damaged mitochondria, arise in alcoholic fatty liver disease, or how, when functioning normally, the pathway reduces levels of hepatocyte apoptosis and lipid accumulation (steatosis) in response to excessive ethanol consumption (Ding et al., 2010; Eid et al., 2013; Lin et al., 2013; Zhong et al., 2014).

Given the deficits in autophagy observed in cardiac, hepatic and neurodegenerative diseases, it is tempting to speculate that enhancing autophagy may be a promising therapeutic avenue for these disorders. However, achieving a critical balance to avoid undesirable consequences will be difficult since excessive autophagy may favor tumorigenesis, as observed in cancer cell lines with activating Ras mutations that have high levels of basal autophagy. Although autophagy can suppress cancer initiation by maintaining cellular homeostasis, autophagy is paradoxically required for the growth of aggressive cancers in conditions of nutrient deprivation and hypoxia found in tumor environments (Guo et al., 2011). It will also be important to ensure that a specific upregulation of autophagy is induced to only remove damaged mitochondria, otherwise it must be balanced with increased mitochondrial biogenesis, to ensure energetic collapse does not occur. In order to reach these objectives, we first must increase our understanding of the molecular characteristics of the relevant pathways.

The turnover of mitochondria and mitochondrial cargo are essential mechanisms that have evolved to ensure the maintenance of a healthy mitochondrial population, which is vital for tissues with high energy demands, such as cardiac, hepatic and nervous tissue. The dissection of these mechanisms and a fuller understanding of the stimuli that induce these pathways is required if they are to be utilized as therapeutic targets for disorders affecting these tissues, which are likely to become significant societal burdens over the next fifty years.

Figure 1. An overview of mitochondrial quality control mechanisms. A) Loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, represented in grey, leads to the accumulation of PINK1, phosphorylation of Ub, and Parkin activation. Parkin ubiquitinates substrates on the outer mitochondrial membrane leading to the recruitment of the autophagosome isolation membrane via autophagy adaptors. B) In response to hypoxia, Bnip3 and NIX are transcriptionally upregulated, leading to their insertion and homodimerization in the outer mitochondrial membrane. Their N-terminal domains contain LC3-interacting regions, and through their interaction with LC3-II and LC3-related proteins, such as GABARAP, they recruit the autophagosome isolation membrane. C) i) The generation of PDH E2/E3-positive double membraned MDVs is stimulated by treatment with antimycin A, an inhibitor of complex III of the electron transport chain, resulting in the production of intra-mitochondrial ROS. ii) Treatment with xanthine oxidase/xanthine (XO/X), which generates ROS external of the mitochondrion, stimulates the generation of TOM20-positive single membraned MDVs. Stimuli that upregulate the production of TOM20- and Vps35-positive (iii) or MAPL-positive (iv) single membraned MDVs are unknown, although they are produced basally.

Figure 2. Model of PINK1/Parkin dependent mitophagy. Under basal conditions, low amounts of Ub are conjugated to outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) proteins. During mitochondrial stress, the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential results in the accumulation of PINK1 on the outer membrane. PINK1 phosphorylates Ub and the Ub-like (Ubl) domain of Parkin, at a conserved Ser65 residue. The binding of phosphorylated Ub and the phosphorylation of the Ubl derepresses the basally inhibited E3-ligase activity of Parkin, triggering a feed-forward amplification loop that results in further Parkin recruitment to the mitochondria. Activated Parkin promotes the ubiquitination of multiple substrates that serve as binding sites for autophagy adaptor proteins (NBR1, p62, NDP52, OPTN). The phosphorylation of OPTN, NDP52 and p62 by TBK1 promotes their interactions with poly-ubiquitinated chains and LC3, resulting in the encapsulation of the organelle into an autophagosome and subsequent delivery to a lysosome for degradation.

Figure 3. Mitochondrial derived vesicle characteristics. Illustration of mitochondrial derived vesicles (MDVs) with their distinctive cargo inclusion and a mechanism for their biogenesis. PINK1 and Parkin are required for the formation of double-membraned, PDH E2/E3-positive TOM20-negative MDVs. TOM20-positive single-membraned vesicles have been described, in addition to TOM20-positive single-membraned MDVs, which requires Vps35 for their generation and oligomeric Drp1 for its turnover. All of these MDVs are directed to the lysosome for degradation of their contents. Finally, MDVs positive for mitochondrial-anchored protein ligase (MAPL) are directed to the peroxisome.

Table 1. Methods used to experimentally induce mitophagy in cultured cells

| Global damage inducers | Description |
|-----------------------|-------------|
| CCCP/FCCP             | Ionophore that abolishes mitochondrial membrane potential. Widely used but affects lysosomal pH (Padman et al., 2013). |
| Valinomycin           | Potassium-selective ionophore that causes depolarization of mitochondria. More specific than CCCP/FCCP and does not affect lysosomal pH. |
| Antimycin A           | Binds cytochrome c reductase in complex III and inhibits electron transfer from cytochrome b to c, generating ROS and eventually leads to a loss of MMP. Much milder than CCCP/FCCP or Valinomycin. |
| Antimycin A and oligomycin | Used in combination to trigger the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. Oligomycin is an inhibitor of F<sub>o</sub>F<sub>1</sub> ATP synthase. |
| ΔOTC                  | Ornithine transcarbamylase mutant lacking its N-terminal 85 amino acid that can induce the mitochondrial unfolded protein response as it aggregates in the matrix. Overexpression leads to PINK1 and parkin recruitment, likely due to TIM23 channel blockage, without loss of MMP (Jin & Youle, 2013). |
| Targeted inducers     |             |
| Photoirradiation      | Photoirradiation with 488 nm light induced mitochondrial depolarization and mitophagy (Kim & Lemasters, 2011). |
| MitoKiller Red        | Mitochondrially-targeted genetically coded photosensitizer induces the production of ROS when exposed to light at 540-580 nm (Yang & Yang, 2011). Can induce local Parkin recruitment and specific mitophagy in individual mitochondria (Ashrafi et al., 2014; Yang & Yang, 2011). |
