## ABSTRACT

The extracellular parasite *Trypanosoma brucei* causes human African trypanosomiasis (HAT), also known as sleeping sickness. Trypanosomes are transmitted by tsetse flies and HAT occurs in foci in sub-Saharan Africa. The disease, which is invariably lethal if untreated, evolves in a first hemo-lymphatic stage, progressing to a second meningo-encephalitic stage when the parasites cross the blood–brain barrier. At first, trypanosomes are restricted to circumventricular organs and choroid plexus in the brain outside the blood–brain barrier, and to dorsal root ganglia. Later, parasites cross the blood–brain barrier at post-capillary venules, through a multi-step process similar to that of lymphocytes. Accumulation of parasites in the brain is regulated by cytokines and chemokines.

Trypanosomes can alter neuronal function and the most prominent manifestation is represented by sleep alterations. These are characterized, in HAT and experimental rodent infections, by disruption of the sleep–wake 24 h cycle and internal sleep structure. Trypanosome infections alter also some, but not all, other endogenous biological rhythms. A number of neural pathways and molecules may be involved in such effects. Trypanosomes secrete prostaglandins including the somnogenic PGD2, and they interact with the host’s immune system to cause release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. From the sites of early localization of parasites in the brain and meninges, such molecules could affect adjacent brain areas implicated in sleep–wakefulness regulation, including the suprachiasmatic nucleus and its downstream targets, to cause the changes characteristic of the disease. This raises challenging issues on the effects of cytokines on synaptic functions potentially involved in sleep–wakefulness alterations.

### 1. Introduction

Human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) is associated with severe disturbances in nervous system functions, which include extrapyramidal and neuropsychiatric symptoms, sensory alterations and characteristic changes in sleep pattern. Due to sleep changes, the disease is also designated with the alternative name, sleeping sickness (Kennedy, 2004).

Two subspecies of the hemoflagellate *Trypanosoma brucei* (*T. b.*), transmitted by populations of tsetse flies in sub-Saharan Africa, cause HAT (Fig. 1). *Trypanosoma brucei gambiense* is the causative agent for the West African or Gambian form of the disease; this subspecies has man as the main host and the disease has a slowly progressive course over months or even years, which increases the chances for transmission of the parasites to the tsetse fly vector. On the other hand, *Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiens*, which is responsible for the East African or Rhodesian form, has game animals and cattle as main hosts; when humans are infected, the course of disease is faster, its evolution being reduced to weeks or a few months. The geographical demarcation line between the two forms follows roughly the Rift Valley, and in Uganda both forms exist (Welburn et al., 2001) (Fig. 1). A third subspecies, *Trypanosoma brucei brucei*, is pathogenic for animals, including rodents, whereas humans have a serum factor, apolipoprotein L-I, that kills this parasite subspecies. Thus, *T. b. brucei* are safer to use in experimental studies than the human pathogenic *T. b. gambiense* and *T. b. rhodesiensie*, which can capture this trypanolytic molecule and therefore survive in the human organism (Vanhollebeke et al., 2008).

The life cycle of the parasites in the vector and host as well as their immunobiology, mechanisms of transmission, and epidemiology have been extensively studied and reviewed. The focus of the present overview is on the interactions between the parasites and the nervous system of the mammalian host.

African trypanosomes spend their life in the blood and tissues without entering the host’s cells. Thus, disturbances of nervous system functions should be caused by factors released either by the parasites or the host’s immune response during the infection, or both. We will here review data indicating that spread of *T. b.* to the nervous system is a multi-step process, which is at least partly regulated by immune response molecules, and that such molecules and trypanosome-derived factors can affect synaptic functions causing nervous system alterations, including the disrupted sleep pattern. In particular, we will address mechanisms for *T. b.* entry into the nervous system and sleep disturbances during the disease caused by the parasite. Other symptoms of *T. b.* infection will also be discussed in the context of the effects exerted by the parasite on synaptic functions.

### 2. Prevalence

HAT is endemic in foci in sub-Saharan African countries (Fig. 1) and, depending on ecological and socioeconomic factors, the disease expands or contracts in these areas (Welburn et al., 2001). The disease has been known for centuries, but reached levels of sizeable epidemics through migration of people and cattle during the colonization of Africa. The outbreak in Uganda at the beginning of last century claimed the life of about two-thirds of the population. During this epidemic, trypanosomes were found in the patients’ cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), thereby establishing the parasite as the causative agent for sleeping sickness. Through programs instituted for vector control and surveillance to diagnose, treat, and follow-up HAT patients, the incidence of the disease gradually decreased and had reached very low levels in mid-1900 (Fig. 1). However, due to political unrest, wars, and movements of populations, the disease re-emerged to reach the same levels in the 1990s as it had in the 1920s. In 1998, 37,991 cases were reported to WHO, with the Gambian form being more than 50 times more common than the Rhodesian form (Fig. 1). The number of non-reported cases is probably much higher. Cases of HAT (about 50 cases annually) have also been reported outside Africa as a result of travelers or workers returning to North America or Europe (Kennedy, 2008).

Through the combined efforts of health organizations and governments to reinforce control and detection of patients with HAT for early treatment, the incidence of the Gambian form, but not of the Rhodesian form, of the disease has decreased again during the last decade (Simarro et al., 2008) (Fig. 1). The decreased incidence of the Gambian form may be ascribed to the fact that humans are the main host for the parasite and are more accessible to treatment than wild game and cattle (a reservoir for the Rhodesian form, as mentioned above). It must be emphasized that in order to reach and maintain a low incidence, fighting sleeping sickness should retain its high priority: without extensive surveillance and control, the disease will inevitably re-emerge as already seen in the last decades of the twentieth century (Simarro et al., 2008).

Fig. 1. African trypanosome life cycle and epidemiology. Top: the two subspecies of Trypanosoma brucei (T. b.), Trypanosoma brucei gambiense and Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense, are transmitted to the host by two distinct groups of Glossina (tsetse) flies: G. palpalis and G. morsitans, respectively. While humans and some domestic animals such as pigs are T. b. gambiense’s main hosts, T. b. rhodesiense’s life cycle mainly involves wild game and cattle, only occasionally infecting humans. Bottom right: the map shows the areas of endemic HAT for the Gambian (yellow shading) and Rhodesian (blue shading) T. b. subspecies. The symbols indicate the number of new cases reported by each country in 2006 (data from Simarro et al., 2008); the largest numbers of cases were reported by the Democratic Republic of Congo (8023), Angola (1105), and Sudan (809). Note that Uganda is equally affected by the two disease forms. Bottom left: the chart shows the number of new cases reported throughout Africa over the years (data from Simarro et al., 2008; see text for more details).

## 3. Spread of African trypanosomes to the nervous system

Initial multiplication of the parasites at the infection site is followed by a hemo-lymphatic stage with waves of parasitemia (stage 1). Subsequently, trypanosomes invade the nervous system to cause a leukoencephalitis (meningo-encephalitic stage 2).

The disease is invariably lethal if left untreated. Effective stage 1 drugs, suramin and pentamidine, penetrate poorly the blood-brain barrier (BBB), and are therefore ineffective at stage 2. For treatment of the late encephalitic stage of HAT, arsenic compounds such as melarsoprol, which are associated with severe and even lethal side-effects, are still widely used. Moreover, there is an increase in melarsoprol-refractory HAT cases (Brun et al., 2001). The alternative drug, DL-α-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), only effective against the West African form of HAT, requires daily intravenous injection, has adverse effects, and is expensive and not readily available. Precise staging of the disease is crucial in view of the therapeutic implications, but current criteria are still under debate (Simarro et al., 2008) and novel diagnostic markers of stage 2 and safer drugs are urgently needed.

### 3.1. Regulation of T. b. proliferation

#### 3.1.1. Intrinsic parasite growth control

In the mammalian host, trypanosomes appear under two different shapes, namely the rapidly dividing slender form, and the non-dividing stumpy form transmissible to the tsetse fly. Parasitic growth can be intrinsically regulated whereby the slender form parasites secrete a factor, of still unknown chemical identity, which induces their differentiation into the stumpy form. Parasites of the latter form produce prostaglandin (PG) D₂, and at critical concentrations PGD₂ induces apoptosis of the stumpy form of the parasites, which is more sensitive to PGD₂ effects than the slender form (Duszenko et al., 2006). Thus, the number of parasites is reduced, which is followed by new waves of parasite replication as seen under in vitro conditions (Duszenko et al., 2006). It has been suggested that this mechanism ensures prompt establishment of the parasite in the host, while preventing the parasite growth to rapidly reach levels threatening the host's life, which would reduce the chances of parasite transmission to the tsetse flies (Figarella et al., 2005, 2006).

##### 3.1.2. Control of the parasite growth by the immune response

Especially important for the control of trypanosome growth in vivo is the host’s immune humoral response to the infection. However, antigenic variations of the variant surface glycoprotein (VSG), which covers almost completely the parasite’s plasma membrane, makes antibodies ineffective at eliminating the parasite (Vickerman, 1985). By switching to a VSG coat that exposes a new antigen, the population of parasites can expand, whereby antibodies against the novel VSG are produced and the cycle repeated. About 10% of the trypanosome genome is devoted to encoding the approximately one thousand different VSG forms. VSG switches are intrinsically driven by the parasites, and are therefore independent of antibody pressure, but may be facilitated by other host-derived immune response factors such as the free radical nitric oxide (NO), and the cytokines tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α or interferon (IFN)-γ (Magez et al., 2008). The role of the
humoral immune response is therefore mainly to eliminate from the blood trypanosomes that have not switched their VSG coats. Within tissues, further control of parasite growth is exerted by the innate and adaptive immune response ([Mansfield and Paulnock, 2005]). Macrophage activation is a very prominent feature of trypanosome infections ([Askonas, 1985]). This activation may be induced by soluble VSGs released from living parasites or by membrane-bound VSGs and immunostimulatory CpG-DNA released from decaying trypanosomes ([Drennan et al., 2005; Harris et al., 2007]). The activation of antigen-presenting cells, i.e. dendritic cells and macrophages, is at least partially dependent on the toll-like receptor (TLR) 9 and the intracellular adaptor molecule MyD88 ([Drennan et al., 2005]). Thus, TNF-α as well as reactive oxygen and nitrogen intermediates, which may be toxic to the parasites, are generated. In addition, trypanosome-activated macrophages/dendritic cells secrete interleukin (IL)-12 and IL-18, and these cytokines may activate in turn T-helper type 1 (Th1) cells to produce IFN-γ. This latter cytokine plays a prominent role in the control of trypanosome infections by stimulating macrophages to produce more trypanotoxic molecules ([Mansfield and Paulnock, 2008]). Decaying parasites may also release a cytoskeletal element, trypanin (formerly trypanosome-lymphocyte triggering factor, TLTF; [Hutchings et al., 2002]), which stimulates enriched fractions of CD8+ (cytotoxic) T cells to secrete IFN-γ ([Vaidya et al., 1997]).

During the infection, immunosuppressive factors are also released ([Mansfield and Paulnock, 2005]). These factors may not only prevent excessive tissue damage, but also help trypanosomes to escape elimination in tissues made hostile by the innate immune response. One such factor is PGE₂, released by the slender form of the parasite ([Kubata et al., 2007]), but cytokines such as IL-10 also play an important role ([Sternberg et al., 2005]). Recently, type I IFNs (IFN-α/β) have been suggested to contribute to down-regulation of IFN-γ and the progression of the infection at later time points, although they also play an important role in controlling the infection at early stages ([Lopez et al., 2008]).

The very complex molecular interactions between trypanosomes and the various arms of the immune response still largely remain to be elucidated. A plethora of biologically active molecules are released to control the infection, but at the same time there may be molecules that favor the survival of extracellular trypanosomes in the hostile environments generated in the host’s tissues. We will focus on two prominent immune response molecules, namely TNF-α, which was first described in trypanosome-infected rabbits and was called “cachectin” ([Beutler and Cerami, 1987]), and IFN-γ. Release of the parasite-derived PGD₂ will also be discussed in the context of mechanisms by which trypanosomes may affect the nervous system (see Section 5.2).

### 3.2. Sites of T. b. neuroinvasion at an early disease stage

Following transmission from the tsetse fly, a skin inflammatory lesion develops at the location of the bite of the fly. Soon after this event, the parasites are rapidly seeded through the lymphatic and blood circulation into the organism, except for organs protected by barriers in the vasculature, i.e. the brain, anterior eye chamber, and tests ([Fig. 2]). Only the brain barriers are here briefly discussed.

The nervous system is equipped with barriers between the blood and the brain parenchyma, as well as between the blood and the CSF and the endoneurium of peripheral nerves ([Abbott et al., 2006; Kristensson and Olsson, 1973; Reese and Karnovsky, 1967; Zlokovic, 2008]). In the central nervous system (CNS), the BBB resides in endothelial cells of brain microvasculature. These cells are connected by tight junctions and show transcytosis only for specific molecules. The blood–CSF barrier resides in the choroid plexus epithelial cells, which are also connected by tight junctions, so that macromolecules passing across the fenestrated endothelia of the choroid plexus are prevented from reaching the CSF. In the peripheral nervous system, blood vessel endothelia in cranial and dorsal root ganglia (DRG) are also fenestrated and permit the passage of macromolecules into the tissues, while a blood-nerve barrier is formed by endoneurial endothelial cells and surrounding perineurial cells, which are all connected by tight junctions.

Furthermore, fenestrated blood vessel endothelia, which allow passage of macromolecules into the tissues, are found in the brain circumventricular organs (CVOs), highly vascularized structures which contain neurons specialized for neurosecretion and/or chemosensitivity. Although CVO blood vessels are permeable to macromolecules, the CVOs are further separated from the brain parenchyma by an external glial barrier, and from the CSF by a barrier of tightly connected covering epithelial cells (tanycytes). The CVOs comprise the neurohypophysis, arcuate nucleus-median eminence complex (AMC), organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis, subfornical and subcommissural organs, area postrema, and pineal gland ([Fig. 3A]).

As shown in experimental rodent models, early after infection trypanosomes localize to areas of the nervous system that have vessels permeable to macromolecules. Thus, parasites and inflammatory white blood cells appear in the cranial ganglia and DRG, choroid plexus and CVOs ([Schultzberg et al., 1988]) ([Fig. 3B]). In the brain, TNF-α and IL-1β transcripts are induced in the basal meninges, choroid plexus and CVOs, including the AMC, before they appear in the brain parenchyma. Induction of iNOS and IFN-γ occurs later with a more restricted expression ([Quan et al., 1999]). Neurons in the hypothalamic supraoptic nucleus (SON) and paraventricular nucleus (PVN), which, as discussed further (see Section 5.1.2) project to the median eminence, show early signs of immune activation during trypanosome infections through the induction of major histocompatibility (MHC) class I molecules ([Foster et al., 2002; Schultzberg et al., 1989]).

#### 3.3. Passage of T. b. across the BBB

Inflammation caused by *T. b. brucei* infection is associated with increased vascular permeability as visualized in the rabbit ear-chamber model ([Goodwin and Hook, 1968]). At late stages of HAT there is mild edema, mainly in the brain white matter, and in experimental rodent models leakage of dyes indicates break-down of the BBB in some brain areas, but with no obvious correlation between dye distribution and occurrence of parasites in the brain ([Philip et al., 1994]). We have observed that parasites can cross the BBB at late disease stages in rats and mice and enter the brain parenchyma with no loss of tight junction proteins in the blood vessels or leakage of serum IgG ([Mulenga et al., 2001]).

##### 3.3.1. Cerebral endothelial cells and basement membranes

After attaching to the endothelial cell surface, inflammatory white blood cells can exit the vessel either through an opening of the tight junction between endothelial cells or by transcytosis at areas close to the tight junctions ([Engelhardt and Wolburg, 2004]). Studies using *in vitro* preparations of BBB have suggested that trypanosomes may pass endothelial cells by either process, and that a trypanosome-derived cathepsin L-like cysteine protease (brucipain) is required for this event ([Grab and Kennedy, 2008; Nikolskaia et al., 2006]). In addition, protease-activated receptor signaling has recently been found to play a role in *T. b. rhodesiense* traversal of human brain endothelial cells *in vitro*, and models of how this signaling event may lead to BBB dysfunction have been proposed ([Grab et al., 2009]).

It should be emphasized that infiltration of inflammatory cells across the BBB occurs at the level of the post-capillary venules ([Owens et al., 2008]), but not of capillaries, for which most of the physiological properties of the BBB have been defined. Post-

Fig. 2. African trypanosomes are transmitted by the tsetse fly (lower left). After replication at the site of injection in the skin, the trypanosomes spread through hemo-lymphatic vessels. When reaching the brain via the blood circulation they pass first through the fenestrated vessels of the choroid plexus and circumventricular organs (upper right) and only later by a multi-step process through the post-capillary venules, which have endothelial cells interconnected by tight junctions (upper left; black bars), into the brain parenchyma.

capillary venules are surrounded by a perivascular space bordered by an endothelial basement membrane and an astrocytic or parenchymal basement membrane (*glia limitans*).

Subsequent steps towards the passage of white blood cells into the parenchyma are regulated by the biochemical composition of these two basement membranes. This has been shown in a series of studies employing mice with experimental allergic encephalomyelitis, which is the prototype of an inflammatory CNS disease and the experimental model of multiple sclerosis (Owens et al., 2008). The first membrane to be crossed is the endothelial basement membrane, which is permissive to passage of lymphocytes if it contains laminin-α4, but not if it contains laminin-α5. Lymphocytes permitted to pass this first membrane may be “on hold” in the perivascular space until processes that allow crossing of the next basement membrane, the *glia limitans*, are initiated. Invasion of white blood cells through the *glia limitans* is the crucial event for induction of signs of disease in experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (Owens et al., 2008).

The *glia limitans* is anchored by a transmembrane β-dystroglycan subunit in astrocytic end-feet. This dystroglycan subunit can be selectively cleaved by the matrix metalloproteases (MMP)-2 and MMP-9 once they are activated during inflammation. Such cleavage creates a localized, temporary opening of the *glia limitans*, which allows passage of white blood cells into the parenchyma (Agrawal et al., 2006). In mice infected with a laboratory clone of *T. b. brucei*, the crossing of *glia limitans* by T cells and parasites is facilitated by IFN-γ (Masocha et al., 2004). In mice deficient in the genes encoding IFN-γ or its receptor, trypanosomes are captured between the two sets of basement membrane (Masocha et al., 2004), similarly to cuffing of T cells “on hold” in the perivascular space.

3.3.2. Chemokines

Chemokines mediate the recruitment and/or retention of inflammatory cells in tissues and may be induced during an infection either directly after innate immune receptor recognition

Note that cell groups that play an important role in promoting sleep prevail anteriorly in the hypothalamus, while those regulating wakefulness are mainly located posteriorly in the hypothalamus. Two different populations of peptidergic neurons reside in the lateral hypothalamic area (LH): neurons containing orexin (Orx), which play a key role in arousal, and neurons containing melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH), which are involved in the regulation of sleep.

(B) The parasites *Trypanosoma brucei* (green) localize in the circumventricular organs and in the choroid plexus at early stages of infection, before crossing the blood-brain barrier and invading the brain parenchyma. During this period of time the parasites are, therefore, in close proximity to cell groups implicated in the regulation of sleep and wake and of endogenous biological rhythms, and, as discussed in the text, immune-related mechanisms involved in host-parasite interactions could disrupt their function. As presented in the text, functional alterations of the SCN and of the orexin-containing neurons, with loss of orexin-containing and MCH-containing neurons, have been documented in experimental models of *Trypanosoma brucei* infections.

of microbial molecules, or indirectly by cytokines secreted in response to infection. As described above (see Section 3.3.1), the pro-inflammatory cytokine IFN-γ plays a paradoxical role by facilitating the penetration of T cells across the BBB in *T. b. brucei* experimental infections in mice (Masocha et al., 2004).

In an array analysis of all chemokine and chemokine receptor mRNAs in mice infected with *T. b. brucei*, we have found that accumulation of T cells and parasites in the brain is associated in particular with up-regulation of genes encoding the IFN-γ-inducible chemokine CXCL10 (formerly named IP-10). Gene-modified mice lacking this chemokine show decreased invasion of T cells and trypanosomes into the brain. The chemokine is localized to parenchymal astrocytes of hypothalamic regions, optic chiasm, and optic tracts (Amin et al., 2009). Since pro-inflammatory cytokines are produced by infiltrating white blood cells in the nearby CVOs (see Section 3.2), we have speculated (Amin et al., 2009) that over time cytokines, including IFN-γ, leak through the surrounding barriers into the brain parenchyma. From the CVOs and the inflamed choroid plexus, cytokines may also leak through the barriers of tanycytes and choroid plexus epithelia, respectively, into the CSF, from where IFN-γ may diffuse between ependymal cells into the brain parenchyma. IFN-γ-induced CXCL10 expression in perivascular astrocytes may then facilitate BBB passage of T cells, which could amplify the process by secreting more IFN-γ (Fig. 4). Along a similar line of reasoning, it has recently been described that in experimental allergic encephalomyelitis a first wave of lymphocytes (*T*~H~-17 cells) enters the brain through the choroid plexus, and that this event triggers a second wave of T cells which, once activated, cross blood vessel endothelia in the brain parenchyma (Reboldi et al., 2009).

CXCL10 was also detected in the CSF of HAT patients in the second, but not the first, stage of disease (Amin et al., 2009). The chemokines CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL3, and the cytokine IFN-γ in the CSF have been previously associated with disease severity in HAT patients (Courtiox et al., 2006; Lejon et al., 2002; Maclean et al.,

Fig. 4. Trypanosoma brucei infections cause inflammation that is most prominent around the third ventricle and in the white matter of the brain. Hypothetically, the first wave of parasites and white blood cells that invade the circumventricular organs and choroid plexus (lower part) cause a release of cytokines, including interferon-γ (IFN-γ). Over time, the barriers around the circumventricular organs and the choroid plexus (the epithelial cells) may be broken and IFN-γ released into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The ependymal cells are, in contrast to the choroid plexus epithelial cells, not interconnected through tight junctions (black bars) permitting diffusion of cytokines into the periventricular parenchyma and white matter. In the brain parenchyma, IFN-γ could induce the interferon-inducible protein 10 (IP-10, which has been renamed CXCL10) in astrocytes. IP-10 is a chemokine that could promote a second wave of white blood cell invasion across the post-capillary venules. This wave of invading white blood cells includes IFN-γ-producing T cells, which would augment the process. Trypanosomes seem to invade the brain parenchyma in parallel with the white blood cells, but the mechanisms for this are still unclear.

4. Effects of African trypanosome infections on sleep and circadian rhythms

As mentioned previously (see Section 1), T. b. infections in patients and in experimental rodents are hallmarked by disturbances of sleep. The regulation of sleep and endogenous rhythms is here summarized as a premise to the presentation of clinical symptoms and discussion of potential pathogenic mechanisms.

4.1. Sleep and wakefulness regulation

Sleep in mammals includes two states: rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and non-REM (NREM) sleep or slow wave sleep (SWS).
frequency (“synchronized”) wave activity of SWS and behavioral quiescence, with reduced activity in the postural muscles. REM sleep (also known as paradoxical sleep) is defined, besides the presence of rapid eye movements, by a low-voltage and fast EEG pattern similar to that of wakefulness but, at variance with wakefulness, with suppressed vigilance and postural muscle tone. NREM and REM sleep alternate in cycles, with NREM sleep preceding REM epochs, indicating that the internal organization of sleep is timed by a reliable oscillator; NREM–REM sleep cycles have a constant period length, with a duration of 90 min in humans (Pace-Schott and Hobson, 2002). NREM–REM sleep cycles vary in duration as a function of the size of the animal and last about 12 min in the rat (McCarley, 2007).

According to the widely accepted two-process model of sleep regulation, homeostatic and circadian factors are integrated in sleep (Borbely, 1982; Daan et al., 1984). A homeostatic process or homeostatic sleep need (sleep drive, process S) accumulates during wakefulness and decreases during sleep; this process, which is sleep–wake dependent, is manifested by increase in sleep propensity over the course of wakefulness. Such propensity is further increased by prior sleep deprivation. A circadian process (process C) counteracts the increasing propensity to sleep of process S during wakefulness, controlling the sleep–wake cycle; this process would determine the times of onset and termination of sleep by changing the threshold of sleep need that will induce sleep. Both the circadian pacemaker and the sleep homeostat contribute to sleep consolidation. Sleep deprivation studies have confirmed that the homeostatic and circadian regulation mechanisms of sleep are mediated by distinct neural substrates (Mistlberger, 2005). Recent data indicate, however, that such segregation may not extend at the molecular level and clock genes play a role in sleep homeostasis (Franken and Dijk, 2009).

In humans (who are diurnal and tend to be monophasic sleepers), a remarkably consistent bout of sleep occurs at night and a consolidated bout of wakefulness occurs during the day. Nocturnal rodents are polyphasic sleepers, and many bouts of sleep (each of them implicating NREM–REM sleep sequences) alternate with wakefulness throughout 24 h, but with a definite prevalence of sleep episodes during daytime and wakefulness during the period of darkness. For example, laboratory rats sleep about 80% of the day, but also approximately 20% of the night under a 12 h–12 h light–dark (LD) cycle conditions (Timo-Iaria et al., 1970). The daily amount and circadian distribution of sleep in mice (which are more active than rats in standard laboratory conditions) exhibits variability across strains (Mistlberger, 2005).

Sleep and wakefulness are complex phenomena which result from global brain functioning and require the coordination of a highly distributed network of neuronal groups that control behavioral, endocrine and autonomic outputs. Humoral factors are also called into play. In particular, an array of molecules, such as adenosine, NO and PGs, have been proposed to play the role of sleep-regulatory substances (Krueger et al., 2008). The involvement of such molecules in the pathogenesis of sleep disturbances in *T. b.* infections is discussed further (see Section 5.2), while a synopsis on neural regulation is presented below.

### 4.1.1. Neural circuits

Neuronal cell groups involved in the regulation of sleep and wakefulness reside in the brainstem, thalamus and hypothalamus, and basal forebrain; they utilize a variety of neurotransmitters (Jones, 2005; Pace-Schott and Hobson, 2002). Due to early localization of *T. b.* in close proximity to the hypothalamus during infection (see Section 3.2), hypothalamic cell groups are of special interest in the present context.

Wakefulness is maintained by the activity of multiple cell groups (Fig. 5) and neuronal systems, and in the context of *T. b.*

infections it is of relevance that these multiple systems are in part redundant, such that each of them seems to contribute in a unique way to the generation and maintenance of wakefulness, but none of them appears to be absolutely necessary (Jones, 2005).

Arousal systems reach the cerebral cortex directly through the thalamocortical system or via extrathalamic pathways. Brainstem neurons elicit cortical activation through a thalamic relay and a ventral relay in the hypothalamus and the basal forebrain. Such circuits comprise cells concentrated in the pontine and mesencephalic reticular core that give rise to the so-called ascending reticular activating system (Moruzzi and Magoun, 1949; Steriade, 1996). In the brainstem, behavioral arousal is also stimulated by monoaminergic cell groups (noradrenergic neurons of the locus coeruleus, serotonergic neurons of the dorsal raphe, dopaminergic neurons in the ventral midbrain tegmentum), and by the cholinergic cell groups located in the mesopontine tegmentum. In the posterior hypothalamus, key centers of the arousal systems are represented by the tuberomammillary nucleus, which contains histaminergic neurons, and the lateral hypothalamic area (LH), where neurons containing the peptide orexin/hypocretin reside (Fig. 6, and see further, Section 4.1.2) Brainstem monoaminergic neurons, hypothalamic histaminergic and orexinergic neurons, and cholinergic neurons of the basal forebrain send direct widespread projections to the cerebral cortex. The discharge of these neurons is maximal during wake and decreases during NREM sleep; most of these neurons cease firing during REM sleep, but cholinergic brainstem and basal forebrain neurons are also active during REM sleep.

In the basal forebrain, thalamus, and hypothalamus, inhibitory mechanisms can “de-activate” the cerebral cortex. First, within the thalamus excitatory thalamocortical neurons can be inhibited by the GABAergic terminals of thalamic reticular nucleus neurons, thus dampening cortical activation. In addition, the discharge of thalamic reticular nucleus neurons during SWS triggers spindle activity and delta oscillations (Steriade, 1996). However, compared to the large number of cell groups involved in arousal, relatively few cell populations seem to be in a position to turn off the arousal system in a coordinated manner (Saper et al., 2005a).

A key role in the regulation of NREM sleep has been ascribed to hypothalamic cell groups and circuits (Saper et al., 2005c), and in particular to the preoptic area of the anterior hypothalamus, where the median preoptic and ventrolateral preoptic nuclei are located (Fig. 6). Neurons of the ventrolateral preoptic nucleus, which contain the inhibitory neurotransmitters GABA and galanin, fire about twice as fast during sleep as during wakefulness and lesions of these cells mainly reduce NREM sleep (Saper et al., 2005c).

Efferent projections of the median preoptic nucleus target several sleep- and arousal-regulatory systems in the hypothalamus, including orexin-containing neurons. The median preoptic nucleus may thus promote sleep by inhibiting orexinergic and monoaminergic arousal systems and dysinhibiting sleep-regulatory neurons in the ventrolateral preoptic nucleus (Uschakov et al., 2007). Neurons of the latter nucleus establish mutually inhibitory connections with tuberomammillary and monoaminergic brainstem neurons, i.e. with key components of the arousal system (Saper et al., 2001, 2005c) (Fig. 5). These pathways have been proposed to act in a fashion similar to an electronic “flip–flop” circuit (Saper et al., 2001, 2005c): when side A of the circuit gains an “edge” over side B, it inhibits side B, thereby reducing inhibitory feedback, which in turn produces further excitatory gain in A. Thus, the circuit seems to operate in a bistable fashion with sharp transitions, and substantial external influences are required to “flip” the circuit to the opposite state. In this model, neurons of the ventrolateral preoptic nucleus have been proposed to play a role of “sleep switch” which ensures rapid transitions from sleep to wake and vice versa (Saper et al., 2001, 2005c).
Overall, recent evidence supports the pioneering work of von Economo (Economo, 1930), who proposed the existence of a “sleep-promoting” anterior hypothalamic area and a “wake-promoting” posterior hypothalamic area.

Reciprocal inhibitory interactions between cholinergic REM-on and monoaminergic REM-off neurons are responsible for REM sleep onset and maintenance (Fort et al., 2009; Pace-Schott and Hobson, 2002). Growing evidence also indicates that the posterior hypothalamus plays a role in the regulation of REM sleep, via the interaction with brainstem cell groups (Fort et al., 2009; Luppi et al., 2006). A “flip-flop” mechanism switching between REM and NREM sleep has also been proposed for mutually inhibitory REM-off and REM-on areas in the mesopontine tegmentum (Lu et al., 2006).

### 4.1.2. Peptidergic neurons of the lateral hypothalamus and sleep disorder

In the context of trypanosome infections, we have devoted special attention to peptidergic neuronal subsets in the LH (see below, Section 5.1.4), given their documented role in sleep disorders.

The population of orexinergic neurons located in the perifornical area and LH plays a crucial role in the maintenance of a consolidated period of wakefulness (Ohno and Sakurai, 2008; Sakurai, 2007; Sutcliffe and de Lecea, 2002). A common precursor peptide, the prepro-orexin derived from a hypothalamic specific transcript, is cleaved to form the two neuropeptides orexin A and B (also known as hypocretin 1 and 2, respectively). Orexin A is a 33 amino acid peptide whose structure is highly conserved in several mammalian species; orexin B is a peptide of 28 amino acids. The majority of neurons which express orexin A (the isoform which is more stable and is more effective in activating orexin 2 receptors) also express orexin B in different species (Nixon and Smale, 2007; Zhang et al., 2002). We here focus on orexin A, which will be referred to simply as orexin.

Orexinergic neurons project widely in the CNS, and orexin receptors are found throughout the CNS; orexin has been implicated in arousal, neuroendocrine functions, food intake behavior and energy homeostasis, and reward mechanisms (Burdakov, 2004; Ohno and Sakurai, 2008; Sutcliffe and de Lecea, 2002), and can exert a powerful excitation on thalamocortical synapses (Lambe and Aghajanian, 2003). Oscillation of Fos protein expression in orexin-containing neurons during the 24-h LD cycle also indicates that these cells are mainly active during wakefulness (Estabrooke et al., 2001). Orexinergic neurons send excitatory influences to key arousal structures such as the tuberomammillary nucleus of the posterior hypothalamus and monoaminergic cell groups in the brainstem (Fig. 5). These excitatory projections are reciprocated by inhibitory feedback connections that are thought to further stabilize the waking state. In fact, if the output from the tuberomammillary nucleus and monoaminergic nuclei decreases, inhibition of orexinergic neurons also decreases; this, in turn, results in restored activity of the ascending brainstem projections (Fig. 5).

The crucial importance of orexin in wakefulness regulation is also supported by data indicating that loss of orexinergic neurons or mutations in genes encoding orexin receptors causes narcolepsy in humans and animals (Kilduff and Peyron, 2000; Ohno and Sakurai, 2008; Sutcliffe and de Lecea, 2002). This rare disorder (mentioned here in view of similarities with sleep changes in HAT; see Section 4.3) is characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness; is dysregulated, and signs of damage are found in this cell group (see text). We hypothesize that alterations of the orexinergic system may contribute to sleep-wake alterations characteristic of the parasitic infection, due to a less stable configuration of the circuitry, with lower transition thresholds.

Summary diagram depicting alterations of endogenous biological rhythms in *Trypanosoma brucei* experimental infection in rats (red traces) compared to the normal condition (dotted black traces). Structures implicated in the regulation of such rhythms are shown in two coronal sections through the rat brain at the level of the anterior and posterior hypothalamus, respectively. Neural circuits implicated in such functions (and discussed in the text) are also indicated. Alteration of the sleep-wake cycle and of sleep structure, and alterations of the pulsatile rhythm of cortisol and prolactin secretion (which are related to sleep phases) have been documented during the infection, while the body temperature cycle and the rhythm of melatonin secretion are mostly preserved, though alterations have also been described (see text). Abbreviations: AMC, arcuate nucleus-median eminence complex; LH, lateral hypothalamic area; PO, preoptic area; PVN, paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus; SCN, suprachiasmatic nucleus; TM, tuberomammillary nucleus.

In particular, patients suffer sudden surges of sleepiness, and fall asleep at inappropriate times. Narcolepsy is also characterized by the occurrence of sleep-onset REM periods (SOREM), i.e., REM sleep episodes which occur either after no NREM sleep or after a very short NREM sleep period, thus disrupting wakefulness or the NREM-REM cycle during sleep (see Section 4.1). The pathological intrusion of REM sleep into wakefulness brings about sudden loss of muscle tone in the form of narcolepsy associated to cataplexy, which represents about 85% of the cases of narcolepsy. In addition, nocturnal sleep in narcolepsy is often disturbed by sleep fragmentation accompanied by hypnagogic hallucinations and vivid dreaming. Most of the patients with narcolepsy and cataplexy and a small proportion of patients with narcolepsy without cataplexy show low or undetectable amount of orexin in the CSF (Mignot et al., 2002; Ripley et al., 2001).

Another population of LH neurons, intermingled with orexergic ones, contains the peptide melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH), and also gives rise to widespread projections reaching sleep- and wake-regulatory cell groups (Bittencourt et al., 1992). This neuronal subset has been implicated in the regulation of locomotor activity, autonomic nervous functions and sleep; in particular, MCH-containing neurons are most active during REM sleep (Verret et al., 2003), have been implicated in sleep homeostatic mechanisms (Adamantidis et al., 2008), and exert an inhibitory influence on orexin-containing neurons, fine-tuning the final output of the LH (Rao et al., 2008). Interestingly, the alterations reported in narcolepsy characteristically involve the orexinergic system and spare the MCH system (Peyron et al., 2000;

Thannickal et al., 2000). The MCH and orexinergic systems are instead both affected in neurodegenerative conditions associated with daytime sleepiness and SOREM episodes, such as Parkinson’s disease, in which orexin levels in the CSF are unaffected (Thannickal et al., 2007).

### 4.2. The biological clock and sleep-wake regulation

The sleep-wake cycle, as well as most physiological functions (such as hormonal secretion and body temperature) and behaviors undergo a daily (circadian, circa diem, about 1 day) variation which follows the 24-h LD cycle due to the daily rotation of the earth. A central role in the mammalian time-keeping system is played by the master clock located in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of the anterior hypothalamus (Antle and Silver, 2005; Morin and Allen, 2006; van Esseveldt et al., 2000). The SCN is entrained to the external LD cycle by retinal input originating from a class of light-sensitive retinal ganglion cells. These cells contain the photopigment melanopsin and their axons form the glutamatergic retinohypothalamic tract. SCN neurons forming the central circadian clockwork are driven by a transcriptional-translational loop enforcing a nearly 24-h cycle of activity even in the absence of external cues. The products of the so-called clock genes are important in the generation and/or maintenance of circadian clock function, and are essential to create and sustain rhythms under constant conditions. The majority of SCN cells are GABAergic and form heterogeneous cell populations on the basis of several parameters, including gene expression, peptidergic phenotype, as

well as input from the retina and other sources (Antle and Silver, 2005; Mistlberger, 2005; Morin, 2007). Functional characteristics will be discussed further (see Sections 5.1.3 and 5.2.1).

Besides light, a main synchronizer for the SCN is represented by melatonin, the hormone synthesized by the pineal gland, which is secreted at night in both diurnal and nocturnal animals, and whose release is inhibited by light. The circadian rhythm of melatonin secretion is generated by the SCN and entrained by its retinal input (Morin and Allen, 2006).

In addition to neural pathways, secreted diffusible factors have also been implicated in the SCN function as circadian pacemaker, and in particular in the inhibitory control of arousal and activity (Kramer et al., 2005; Silver et al., 1996). Little information is available on such humoral factors, but two candidate molecules are the transforming growth factor-α, which is mainly localized in astrocytes, and prokineticin-2; they are both expressed by SCN cells and their receptors are expressed in major SCN target areas (Mistlberger, 2005).

Concerning neural output, the SCN is linked to both sleep-active and wake-active cell groups through monosynaptic and, more frequently, polysynaptic pathways. The SCN mostly projects to nearby hypothalamic areas, so that direct SCN outputs to state-regulatory systems are remarkably limited (Antle and Silver, 2005; van Esseveldt et al., 2000). Main targets of the SCN are represented by the hypothalamic PVN, subparaventricular zone, and dorsomedial nucleus, which convey the circadian message to other downstream target brain areas and seem, in turn, to be involved in the circadian regulation of specific body functions (Saper et al., 2005b).

The PVN is also connected to pre-ganglionic sympathetic and parasympathetic neurons of the intermediolateral column of the spinal cord and dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, and thereby plays a key role in relaying to autonomic motor neurons information derived from the SCN (see Section 5.1.2). As mentioned previously, the PVN is sensitive to immune challenge during *T. b.* infections, as revealed by MHC class I induction in this nucleus at an early stage (see Section 3.2). The ventral subparaventricular zone appears to be involved in the control of circadian rhythms of sleep-wakefulness alternations, locomotor activity and feeding, whereas the dorsal subparaventricular zone seems especially involved in the regulation of body temperature rhythm (Lu et al., 2001). Lesions of the dorsomedial nucleus alter circadian rhythms of sleep-wakefulness behavior, as well as rhythms in feeding, locomotor activity and corticosteroid secretion (Chou et al., 2003), while largely sparing circadian rhythms of body temperature and plasma melatonin (Mistlberger, 2005). However, since ablation of the dorsomedial nucleus may also damage fibers of passage, a definition of the role of individual SCN targets in endogenous rhythm regulation, including sleep and wake, requires cell-specific studies (Moriya et al., 2009).

Although the SCN does not project abundantly beyond the hypothalamus, a major extra-hypothalamic target of SCN efferents is represented by the thalamic paraventricular nucleus, which in turn sends fibers to the limbic system. This pathway may contribute to affective and emotional aspects of behavior whose disturbances, on the other hand, are frequently associated with dysregulation of the sleep-wake cycle (Peng and Bentivoglio, 2004).

In line with the established role of the SCN as master circadian pacemaker, a role of the biological clock in sleep-wake regulation was demonstrated by an early study of SCN ablation in the rat (Ibuka and Kawamura, 1975). This study showed a disruption of the temporal distribution of sleep and wakefulness during 24 h, without altering the total daily amount of either state, or of REM and NREM sleep. While further supporting evidence exists, the precise role played by the SCN in sleep regulation in different species, including humans, is still debated (Mistlberger, 2005;

Moore, 2007). Current data seem to indicate that the SCN, in addition to its circadian control, may actively promote arousal during the active phase and sleep during the rest phase (Mistlberger, 2005).

Since few regions of the sleep-wake-regulatory system receive direct projections from the SCN, the control exerted by this nucleus on the sleep-wake cycle appears to be largely mediated by indirect connections through intermediate hypothalamic areas. The SCN, however, sends direct efferents to the medial preoptic area (Leak and Moore, 2001; Watts et al., 1987), and sparser projections to the ventrolateral preoptic and tuberomammillary nuclei, as well as to the LH area containing orexinergic neurons (Abrahamson and Moore, 2001; Chou et al., 2002). On the other hand, the median preoptic area, subparaventricular zone and dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus represent possible relay nuclei for indirect SCN projections to sleep-promoting and wake-regulatory cell groups in the hypothalamus (including orexinergic neurons) and in the brainstem (Deurveilher et al., 2002; Deurveilher and Semba, 2003, 2005).

Importantly, the circadian time-keeping activity of the SCN is also regulated by feedback mechanisms, including REM and NREM sleep and wakefulness, so that the transitions between vigilance states are paralleled by changes in SCN firing rate, and changes in vigilance states not only influence sleep homeostatic mechanisms, but also cause changes in SCN electrical activity (Deboer et al., 2003, 2007).

### 4.3. Disturbances of sleep and circadian rhythms in HAT

Changes in sleep pattern have been investigated in *T. b. gambiense* HAT patients with continuous polysomnographic recordings (Buguet et al., 2001, 2005). Despite its alternative name of sleeping sickness, HAT is not a hypersomnia, and the total amount of sleep and of each sleep stage is not increased during the disease. In particular, NREM sleep shows no increase and is often even decreased. The hallmark alterations observed in HAT patients are: (i) polyphasic sleep-wake patterns leading to a profound disruption of the alternation of sleep and wake during 24 h and (ii) alterations of the internal structure of sleep, characterized by SOREM episodes, which may appear earlier than the sleep-wake alterations. Non-characteristic morphological alterations can also be observed in the EEG of HAT patients. The severity of the disruption of the sleep-wake cycle, with short sleep episodes occurring with almost equal frequency during day and night, is proportional to the severity of the disease.

Although sleep alterations, including SOREM episodes, recede or disappear after treatment of the infection, improvements may take several months after treatment to unfold (Buguet et al., 1999). This finding indicates that sleep-wake changes in HAT are not directly related to the presence of the parasite in the brain, and points to slowly reversible functional alterations and/or to compensatory mechanisms over time, rather than to severe structural damage of sleep-wake regulating regions during the disease. This is of special interest in relation to the effects at synaptic level of molecules involved in trypanosome infections, which are discussed further (see Section 5.2).

Actigraphy with wrist-worn watches is used to record the rest-activity rhythm in humans, and has been validated for circadian rhythm disorders and sleep pattern disturbances, showing a good correspondence with polysomnographic recordings (Morgenthaler et al., 2007; Sack et al., 2007). Preliminary data obtained with actigraphy recording and validated with polysomnography indicate that this technique can detect sleep-wake changes by monitoring activity in *T. b. gambiense* HAT patients (Bentivoglio et al., 2008), and could represent a new valuable tool to objectively monitor disease severity.

As mentioned previously (see Section 1), the West and East African forms of HAT present the same phenotype, the main difference being the time course of disease. Polysomnographic investigation performed in a *T. b. rhodesiense* HAT patient has confirmed data obtained in *T. b. gambiense* HAT cases, and in particular poor sleep efficiency with frequent awakenings and arousals at night and recurrent short naps during the day; periodic limb movements were also observed during sleep (Sanner et al., 2000). This *T. b. rhodesiense* HAT patient was admitted to the hospital because of fever and sleep disturbances, did not show signs of encephalitis or brain alterations in magnetic resonance imaging, and recovered after treatment with suramin (a drug effective in stage 1) (Sanner et al., 2000).

SOREM episodes occur in different disorders and diseases, and are especially characteristic in narcolepsy (see Section 4.1.2). At least the Gambian form of HAT shares other features, besides SOREM episodes, with narcolepsy, such as excessive daytime sleepiness, and sleep fragmentation (Bentivoglio and Kristensson, 2007; Dauvilliers et al., 2008). Cataplexy-like events have been described in HAT, although they have not been characterized or thoroughly investigated (Dauvilliers et al., 2008). CSF orexin levels measured in patients affected by *T. b. gambiense* HAT are significantly higher than in narcoleptic patients but lower than in control cases, indicating that dysfunction of this hypothalamic peptide may be involved in HAT (Dauvilliers et al., 2008), as also indicated by experimental data presented below (see Section 5.1.4).

It is worth recalling that orexin levels in the CSF and loss of orexergic neurons in the LH have been examined in a variety of neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory human diseases associated with sleep disorders (including Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and Huntington’s diseases, as well as multiple sclerosis). Overall, the available data do not point out a tight direct correlation between loss of orexergic neurons, CSF orexin levels, and sleep disturbances in these conditions (Bourgin et al., 2008).

Since the sleep-wake alterations which characterize HAT point to disturbances of the circadian timing system, rhythms of hormonal secretion have also been examined in *T. b. gambiense* HAT patients, and have been found to be differentially affected in the disease. The rhythm of secretion of the pineal hormone melatonin is maintained in HAT patients in the encephalic stage, though with a slightly advanced phase, and the rhythm of body temperature is also preserved (Claustre et al., 1998). The circadian profile of cortisol and prolactin plasma levels as well as plasma renin activity (an index of release of renin, a key enzyme in the renin-angiotensin system) are instead severely disrupted in HAT patients at an advanced stage of disease (Brandenberger et al., 1996; Radomski et al., 1995). The pulsatility of release of these hormones is related to sleep stages in healthy subjects. In particular, the rhythm of prolactin secretion is strongly influenced by the sleep-wake cycle, and the nocturnal oscillation of plasma renin activity is closely related to the NREM-REM cycle, whereas cortisol release is scarcely influenced by sleep but exhibits a temporal association with NREM sleep (Brandenberger et al., 1996). In HAT, the altered circadian profile of pulses of these hormones maintains its relationship with specific sleep stages (Brandenberger et al., 1996), and the secretion of growth hormone, which is associated with NREM sleep, also maintains its relationship with this sleep phase (Radomski et al., 1996). Such findings indicate that the association of hormone release with the sleep-wake cycle and with the internal sleep structure is preserved in HAT, though the circadian profile of these rhythmic functions is altered during the disease.

Altogether the studies of sleep and circadian rhythms in HAT patients point to changes of the sleep-wake cycle and sleep pattern

as the cardinal disturbance of endogenous biological rhythms during the disease, with preservation of other rhythmic functions.

### 4.4. Disturbances of sleep and circadian rhythms in experimental *T. b.* infections

*T. b. brucei* infections are widely used in the laboratory to investigate sleep and circadian rhythms in experimental animals. In early studies, both the amount of time spent in SWS and the occurrence of delta-wave amplitudes during SWS were found to be increased during febrile episodes in infected rabbits (Toth et al., 1994), while sleep fragmentation was recorded in rat infection models with a rather acute (Montmayeur and Buguet, 1994) or more chronic (Bentivoglio et al., 1994b) course of infection. Sleep organization and the profile of circadian rhythms were subsequently examined in detail in rats with a course of infection of about 5 weeks; EEG recordings were performed at 19–21 days post-infection from 4 to 6 h during daytime or night-time (Grassi-Zucconi et al., 1995). The internal structure of sleep was found to be disrupted, with a fragmented pattern of SWS, interrupted by frequent awakenings, with marked reduction in the mean REM latency and a consequent alteration of the REM-NREM sequence. In the same study, the rest-activity cycle was found to be preserved in the infected animals, though with a reduction of locomotor activity, and body temperature rhythm was also maintained (Grassi-Zucconi et al., 1995). A subsequent investigation in infected rats with a disease course of about 20 days, day/night core temperature differences were found to be reduced in some of the animals, indicating disturbances of circadian regulation of body temperature rhythm (Berge et al., 2005).

With chronic telemetric monitoring of infected rats with a disease course of about 20 days (Darsaud et al., 2004), SOREM-like episodes (defined in the rat as REM sleep episodes after a period of wakefulness of at least 40 s, not interrupted by SWS) have been documented a few days before death concomitantly with the observation of body weight loss. Furthermore, during the last 2 days of the animal’s life the amount of SWS increased and the amount of wakefulness decreased during both light and dark conditions (Darsaud et al., 2004). In a more chronic rat model of the disease, we observed by means of telemetric monitoring SOREM-like events prior to obvious body weight losses, and thus relatively early after infection (Palomba et al., 2008). The onset and progression of sleep anomalies is currently being investigated in our laboratory together with the timing of parasite invasion of the brain parenchyma.

The rhythm of melatonin secretion has also been investigated in *T. b. brucei*-infected rats kept in a 12 h:12 h LD cycle. As in HAT, the diurnal rhythm of melatonin secretion in the urine was found to be preserved, but the amplitude of the nocturnal peak was decreased, and the peak of melatonin receptor binding in the SCN showed a 4 h phase advance (Kristensson et al., 1998).

A normal sleep pattern could be restored in *T. b. brucei*-infected rats by administration of melatonin or a melatonin agonist in the fifth week post-infection (at the onset of sleep anomalies in the model used in this study, with a disease duration of about 7 weeks) (Grassi-Zucconi et al., 1996). This finding may be ascribed to a specific phase-resetting action or to a hypnogenic effect of the administered compounds. The mean duration of SWS episodes remained, however, significantly decreased in the infected animals even after melatonin treatment (Grassi-Zucconi et al., 1996).

Altogether these studies indicate that experimental *T. b. brucei* infections in rodents can provide a model suited for the study and monitoring of endogenous rhythms and sleep-wake changes during the disease, although they may not reproduce the full spectrum of changes documented in HAT.

5. Pathogenetic mechanisms of sleep–wake disruption in African trypanosome infection

5.1. Involvement of brain regions implicated in sleep–wake regulation

For the discussion of pathogenetic mechanisms, it is first of all worth to emphasize that only minor, if any, signs of degeneration of neuronal cell bodies have been found in the brain of T. b. brucei-infected rats and mice, even in chronic forms of experimental infection (Keita et al., 1997; Mhlanga et al., 1997; Quan et al., 1999), though degenerating fibers have been revealed by silver staining in a few brain sites in T. b. brucei-infected rats (Quan et al., 1999). Glial cell activation is instead, as dealt with below, a major and consistent histopathological feature of T. b. infection.

The findings reviewed in the previous sections draw attention on the CVOs and on hypothalamic structures in the pathogenesis of sleep–wake alterations during T. b. infection, which will be here discussed. It is, however, worth mentioning that hypotheses on the involvement of other brain structures in HAT have also been put forth, including a possible serotonergic basis of sleep–wake disruption (Buguet, 1999). The latter hypothesis is based on experimental findings indicating that sleep disturbances caused by lesions of the dorsal raphe are reversible, like sleep–wake disturbances in HAT after treatment, and on the occurrence in HAT patients of anti-tryptophan-like antibodies which could exert a toxic effect on dorsal raphe neurons (Buguet et al., 2001). This hypothesis awaits, however, further data on alterations of serotonergic neurons and circuits during T. b. infection.

5.1.1. Glial cell activation

Activated astrocytes and microglial cells play crucial biological functions in the CNS during inflammation, including the production of cytokines, chemokines and NO (Hanisch and Kettenmann, 2007; Raivich and Banati, 2004; Raivich et al., 1999; Seifert et al., 2006). A diffuse proliferation and hypertrophy of astrocytes, and activation of microglial cells with the formation of microglial nodules, can represent major histopathological features of HAT (Chimelli and Scaravilli, 1997; Kristensson and Bentivoglio, 1999).

Astrocytes, characterized by the astrocyte-specific marker glial fibrillary acidic protein, are markedly activated in murine models of experimental T. b. brucei infection (Hunter et al., 1992a; Keita et al., 1997). The astrocytic reaction was observed at late disease stages, with proliferation of reactive astrocytes occurring throughout the brain of infected mice, prominently in the white matter (Hunter et al., 1992a). Clusters of degenerating astrocytes in the brain were also observed in the rat model of chronic trypanosome infection (Quan et al., 1999). In addition, reactive astrocytes are a prominent feature in the murine model of post-treatment encephalopathy (Hunter et al., 1992b). In infected mice, the production of inflammatory cytokines coincides with astrocytic activation, suggesting that these cells are a source of cytokines in the brain during the infection (Hunter et al., 1992a). In vitro studies on the effects of T. b. brucei on the reactive response of astrocytes in primary cultures showed that degenerated parasitic material and astrocyte cell debris may initiate astrogliosis (Pentreath et al., 1994). Parasite products in combination with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exert a synergistic effect on the production of PGD₂ and PGE₂ by cultured fibroblasts and astrocytes (Alafiatayo et al., 1994).

We have investigated the features of cells of the microglia/macrophage lineage in T. b. brucei-infected rats, together with sleep changes during the infection (Chianella et al., 1999). Hypertrophic microglial elements show in infected rats a prevalence in subpial brain regions, including the superficial layers of the cerebral cortex, as well as in other brain areas (lateral septum, amygdala, and dentate gyrus of the hippocampus), and are especially dense in hypothalamic periventricular and ventral regions. In the course of the infection, hypertrophic microglia become evident concomitantly with the appearance of sleep anomalies. In addition, microglia activation becomes more marked, leading also to the formation of cell clusters, during the disease progression revealed by worsening of sleep anomalies. In the late stage of the infection, highly activated microglial cells are densely distributed in a band of hypothalamic tissue extending from the suprachiasmatic to the tuberal regions. Thus, in the brain of trypanosome-infected rats microglia activation exhibits a topographical prevalence, with a time course that parallels the onset and progression of sleep anomalies.

5.1.2. Involvement of circumventricular organs: the arcuate nucleus-median eminence complex

As mentioned above (see Section 3.2), trypanosomes target the CVOs before entering the brain parenchyma, and the AMC is a site of heavy accumulation of parasites and lymphocytes in both rats and mice. The AMC is connected to several areas involved in sleep/wakefulness and circadian rhythm regulation (Fig. 6); its connection with the SCN provides a feedback system for the control of insulin, corticosterone and melatonin secretion. The function of this AMC–SCN connection is demonstrated by intravenous injection of the ghrelin mimetic GHRP-6, which results in the reduction of light-induced Fos immunoreactivity in the SCN (Yi et al., 2006, 2008). Thus, AMC inputs to the SCN provide a pathway to integrate endocrine signals into the clock mechanisms (Buijs et al., 2006).

Other CVOs are also connected with neuronal cell groups involved in sleep–wake regulation. For instance, the subfornical organ and organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis are interconnected with the hypothalamic medial and lateral preoptic areas, LH, PVN, and SON via input and output pathways. Fibers from the subfornical organ also reach directly the SCN (McKinley and Oldfield, 1990), as well as the locus coeruleus, dorsal raphe nucleus, and mesopontine cholinergic cell groups in the brainstem (McKinley and Oldfield, 1990).

Endocrine neurons in the PVN and other hypothalamic structures are part of the polysynaptic pathway through which the SCN can control rhythmic hormone release (see Section 4.2). The PVN, as well as the SON, LH, and the locus coeruleus, project to the AMC (Yi et al., 2006) and may also be involved in relaying information of peripheral inflammation to the brain, since systemic injections of both LPS and IL-1β elicit Fos induction in this nucleus (Ericsson et al., 1994; Wan et al., 1993). LPS treatment can induce MHC class I molecules in the PVN as it occurs in T. b. brucei infections (Foster et al., 2002; Schultzberg et al., 1989; see also Section 3.2) which indicates that this nucleus responds immunologically to an inflammatory process in the AMC. The TLR for LPS signaling (TLR4) is expressed in the CVOs (Laflamme and Rivest, 2001) and microglia (Chakravarty and Herkenham, 2005), and TLR9, which may recognize trypanosome components (see Section 3.1.2), is expressed in microglia as well (Dalpe et al., 2002).

Hypothetically, axon terminals of PVN neurons reaching the AMC (outside the BBB) could sense the presence of inflammatory mediators and transmit information by retrograde signaling to their cell bodies in the hypothalamus (inside the BBB). Thus, the involvement of CVOs and in particular of the AMC, may affect components of the sleep–wake-regulatory networks during trypanosome infection. Information to hypothalamic nuclei from visceral organs has also been suggested to be mediated by the vagus nerve via its nuclei in the brainstem (Wan et al., 1994).

5.1.3. Involvement of the biological clock and differential effects on endogenous biological rhythms

Information on immune-regulatory mechanisms in the SCN is still limited, although in the last years a number of reports have
pointed out that the function of the biological clock is affected by immune-related challenges (Coogan and Wyse, 2008). Intracerebroventricular injections of IFN-γ in adult rats elicits activation of SCN neurons revealed by induction of Fos protein (Robertson et al., 2000), pointing out that biological clock neurons are sensitive to cytokine exposure. Functional activation of the SCN, particularly of its dorsal part, in response to acute LPS systemic administration during the early subjective night has also been reported (Marpegan et al., 2005). Chronic systemic administration of LPS causes a decrease of light-induced Fos immunoreactivity in the SCN, which is reversible over time (Palomba and Bentivoglio, 2008). SCN-derived astrocytes, which have been proposed to act as an interface for immune-circadian signaling, respond *in vitro* to LPS as well as TNF-α and IL-1β with increased expression of NF-κB, the transcription factor that plays a major role in inflammation (Leone et al., 2006). Receptors for TNF-α and IFN-γ as well as the suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS) 1 and 3 (key molecules in cytokine regulation) are expressed in the rodent SCN, and some of them show circadian variations, (Leone et al., 2006; Lundkvist et al., 1998; Marpegan et al., 2004; Sadki et al., 2007). Pro-inflammatory mediators administered intracerebroventricularly activate neurons of different SCN subregions in a circadian time-dependent manner (Sadki et al., 2007).

The above findings indicate that immune signaling could affect SCN function during *T. b.* infections, and we have obtained several pieces of supporting evidence in this respect. In our initial studies on rats infected with *T. b. brucei*, Fos expression was found to be dysregulated in the SCN during the LD cycle (Bentivoglio et al., 1994a), and Fos induction in response to light pulses was found to be markedly decreased (Peng et al., 1994). Tracing studies indicated that the retino-hypothalamic tract is not disrupted in infected rats, while glutamate receptor subunits that gate retinal afferents in the SCN show reduced expression in the retino-recipient part of the nucleus (Lundkvist et al., 1998). Spontaneous postsynaptic activity recorded in slice preparations from *T. b.* brucei-infected rats shows a decrease in the frequency of excitatory synaptic events, and similar alterations are caused by treatment with TNF-α and with IFN-γ combined with LPS (Lundkvist et al., 2002).

While the above data point to alterations in the master circadian pacemaker during *T. b.* infections, several issues remain to be resolved. In particular, as described above, both clinical and experimental studies (see Sections 4.3 and 4.4) indicate that circadian rhythms are differentially affected by *T. b.* infection: rhythms of sleep–wakefulness as well as cortisol and prolactin secretion are severely disrupted, while body temperature cycles and rhythms in melatonin release and locomotion are mostly maintained (Fig. 6). This indicates that rhythmic parameters show differences in their vulnerability to inflammatory molecules.

One possible explanation for differential effects on circadian rhythms during *T. b.* infections could be provided by differences in the response of cell populations of the SCN to the infection. As mentioned previously (see Section 4.2), cell subsets have been identified in the SCN on the basis of various parameters. These include phase heterogeneity which may reflect independent, though coupled, endogenous oscillatory compartments within the SCN. Differentially phased SCN clock cells in different compartment of the nucleus may represent a basis for differential circadian timing regulation of specific behavioral, autonomic and endocrine rhythms (Mistlberger, 2005).

The neuronal heterogeneity within the SCN is also reflected in electrical properties such as spontaneous firing rate patterns, resting membrane potential and phase relationships of firing rate rhythms (Nakamura et al., 2001; Pennartz et al., 1998; Schaap et al., 2003), as well as in expression of the clock gene Period1 (Quintero et al., 2003). At least 4 different populations of SCN

neurons can be identified on the basis of different timing of electrical activity and different SCN cell groups may therefore control different output signals (reviewed in Kalsbeek et al., 2006). SCN neuron subsets are also differentially affected by cytokine exposure, as discussed further (see Section 5.2.1). However, it is still unclear whether different SCN cell populations are involved in the regulation of different parameters of circadian rhythms. The finding that some but not all circadian rhythm components can be restored after lesion of the SCN followed by its transplantation (Meyer-Bernstein et al., 1999; Silver et al., 1996) also indicates differences in the robustness or vulnerability of these components to an insult.

Taking into account the role of neural circuitry in the differential effect of *T. b.* infections on endogenous biological rhythms, segregation of SCN output to its relay targets in the hypothalamus and from these relays to functional downstream target areas (see Section 4.2) should also be considered. Such segregation may account for a differential effect of the SCN on the control of different endogenous biological rhythms (Deurveilher and Semba, 2005). Therefore, different degrees of functional disruption of downstream targets of SCN circuits could account for differential effects on biological rhythms during *T. b.* infections, as previously hypothesized (Claustre et al., 1998). Neural pathway segregation may also contribute to the differential effects exerted on different rhythmic functions by cytokines and PGs, which will be discussed further (see Section 5.2). Alternatively or in addition, during *T. b.* infections the inflammatory process that spreads into the brain parenchyma from the CVOs may reach the spatially separated relay targets of the SCN with different intensities.

5.1.4. Involvement of peptidergic neurons of the lateral hypothalamus

On the basis of the key role played by orexin in the maintenance and consolidation of wakefulness, we have examined the orexinergic system in rodents infected with *T. b. brucei*. This study was also prompted by the clinical data showing similarities in sleep changes in narcolepsy and HAT, and by the occurrence of SOREM episodes, characteristic of both diseases in humans, also in experimental *T. b. brucei* infections (see Sections 4.1.2, 4.3, and 4.4).

We have examined in infected mice the levels of orexin mRNA with quantitative real-time RT-PCR. The data have indicated that the levels of orexin transcript may be unaffected for a relatively prolonged period of time during the infection (Palomba et al., 2007). The quantitative study of orexinergic neurons in infected rats has shown a progressive decrease, which becomes significant at an advanced stage of infection (Palomba et al., 2007). Measurement of orexin levels in the CSF of the same infected rats has not shown significant changes (Palomba et al., 2007).

On the basis of previous data indicating that Fos expression in orexinergic neurons correlates positively with the amount of wakefulness and negatively with the amount of sleep (Estabrooke et al., 2001; see also Section 4.1.2), we have evaluated the spontaneous activity of orexinergic neurons at early day and early night with double immunocytochemistry, using Fos protein as a marker of neuronal activity. In control non-infected rats, the number of orexinergic neurons expressing Fos is significantly higher at night-time than at daytime, whereas the reverse occurs in rats at 1 month post-infection (Palomba et al., 2007). We have also examined MCH-containing neurons in *T. b.* brucei-infected rats (Palomba et al., 2007), and the number of these cells is decreased at an advanced stage of disease.

Altogether the data point out that the orexinergic and MCH systems are affected by trypanosome infection. These findings correlate with data obtained in HAT patients (see Section 4.3).

The reason/s for a vulnerability of LH peptidergic cell populations during *T. b.* infection remains to be determined. In addition, given the different roles of orexin and MCH in sleep–wake regulation (see Section 4.1.2), the role played by changes in these peptides in sleep–wake alterations during the infection remains to be unraveled. However, the finding of a dysregulation of the day/night activity of orexinergic cells is of particular relevance in view of the mutual interactions of these neurons with other cell groups involved in sleep–wake regulation, and their hypothesized role in the transition between these two states and as stabilizers of the circuit (see Section 4.1.2), which would thus destabilize during *T. b.* infection (Fig. 5).

### 5.2. Effects of cytokines and prostaglandins on neuronal functions altered in trypanosome infections

As indicated in Section 3.1.2, infections with African trypanosomes are associated with induction of cytokine production. TNF-α and IL-1β are both somnogenic and play an important role in the pathogenesis of sleep and fever in the sickness response to an infection (Bryant et al., 2004; Krueger et al., 2001), but less is known about the effects of IFN-γ in these functions. However, TNF-α and IFN-γ play an important role in the outcome of trypanosome infection (Drennan et al., 2005; Mansfield and Paulnock, 2005). We will therefore focus on these two cytokines, and also discuss trypanosome-derived PGs, in deciphering mechanisms behind nervous system dysfunctions in HAT at the neuronal or synaptic level.

Although cytokines were originally defined due to their role in intra- and intercellular signaling in the immune system, novel concepts have emerged on the effects of cytokines on ion channel function, neuronal excitability and synaptic transmission under physiological as well as pathological conditions (Viviani et al., 2007). Cytokine signaling may be regulated at multiple levels determining the duration and magnitude of signals. Possible mechanisms include the concentration of cytokine to initiate a response, the regulation of the expression of cell surface receptors, and intracellular SOCS (Rakesh and Agrawal, 2005). All such mechanisms ensure that homeostasis is maintained to avoid excessive or insufficient signaling which could be deleterious.

Cytokines may affect the function of a neuron by fast signaling events as well as by delayed transcription-dependent processes, which can cause ripple effects involving thousands of gene transcripts. The effects may be elicited at the neuronal membrane and/or synapse as well as at the level of neuron–glia interactions. Both TNF-α and IFN-γ are potent inducers of iNOS transcripts and NO production, implicated in the control of *T. b.* growth (see Section 3.1.2), and are likely to play a role in the pathogenesis of some nervous system dysfunctions in HAT as well. On the basis of the data presented above on the vulnerability of hypothalamic cell groups to trypanosome infection, we will here focus on these neuronal cell groups when outlining cytokine effects at the cellular level.

#### 5.2.1. TNF-α

TNF-α and IL-1β, which often have similar effects, induce activation of NF-κB that in turn drives the transcription of many molecules involved in inflammatory signaling. Many of these are also thought to be involved in sleep regulation such as the adenosine A1 receptor, cyclooxygenase-2, and NOS. During *T. b.* brucei infections, intense iNOS mRNA induction as well as NOS activity can be seen starting in the choroid plexus and extending into the brain parenchyma at late stages (Quan et al., 1999; Keita et al., 2000; see also Section 3.2).

NO, which can be induced by both TNF-α and IL-1β, can exert a multitude of effects on neuronal function, including modulation of firing activity mediated by cyclic 3′–5′ guanosine monophosphate (Smith and Otis, 2003), and may have concentration-dependent opposing physiological effects, as seen, for example, on delayed rectifier K⁺ channel currents (Han et al., 2006). NO has been suggested as one of several molecules involved in homeostatic sleep regulation (see Section 4.1), since NOS inhibitors decrease spontaneous sleep (Monti et al., 1999), while NO donors have an opposite effect (Kapas and Krueger, 1996). Intracerebroventricular administration of IL-1β induces increase of NREM sleep at doses lower than those needed to induce fever (Olivadoti and Opp, 2008), and inhibitors of NOS block sleep responses but not fever (Kapas et al., 1994) showing that regulation of these two components of the sickness response to an infection, sleep and fever, can be distinct from each other and dependent on cytokine concentrations.

In contrast to the large amount of data on the effects of TNF-α and IL-1β on sleep-regulating cell groups, less is known about their potential effects on the SCN. Systemic injection of TNF-α can interfere with the expression of the clock-controlled gene *Dbp* in the SCN and cause prolonged rest periods in mice (Cavadini et al., 2007). At the synaptic level, TNF-α modulates synaptic activity and spontaneous firing in the SCN (Nygård et al., 2009), in a manner similar to effects of TNF-α on synaptic transmission and spontaneous firing activity in other brain areas (Katafuchi et al., 1997; Shibata and Blatteis, 1991; Tancredi et al., 1992). The effect of TNF-α on SCN neuronal activity is blocked when NOS activity is inhibited, indicating that NO may be involved in the effects of this cytokine on synaptic function also in SCN neurons (Nygård et al., 2009).

Concerning the differential effects of *T. b.* infection on different endogenous rhythms (see Section 5.1.3), it is interesting to note that, within the ventrolateral region of the SCN, TNF-α increases spontaneous firing in the majority of cells, whereas other cells do not respond and a minor fraction of cells reduces its activity (Nygård et al., 2009). This heterogeneous pattern can be seen also in responses of SCN cells to other molecules, such as orexins which elicit firing rate suppression in the majority of neurons, whereas the firing rate remains unaffected in a significant proportion of recorded cells (Brown et al., 2008). This variety of responses may be related to the cell phenotypic heterogeneity in the SCN outlined above, and detailed mapping of the expression of receptors for such ligands and their downstream signaling components in the SCN would be valuable for the understanding of these phenomena.

Data indicating that TNF-α can affect synaptic scaling (Stellwagen and Malenka, 2006) is also of interest, since synaptic homeostatic mechanisms have been suggested to play an important role in sleep function as a means for the brain to control energy expenditure and space by down-scaling synaptic strength (Tononi and Cirelli, 2006). Experimental evidence supporting this notion has now emerged, based on sleep-dependent changes in cortical AMPA receptor phosphorylation and evoked synaptic responses (Vyazovskiy et al., 2008). Since exposure to TNF-α causes a generalized AMPA receptor up-scaling (Stellwagen and Malenka, 2006), an excessive and long-term secretion of TNF-α, as it occurs in HAT, may lead to dysfunction in homeostatic synaptic scaling and thereby affect sleep and other neuronal functions.

#### 5.2.2. IFN-γ

In contrast to TNF-α, information on effects of IFN-γ on neurons which regulate circadian rhythms and sleep–wakefulness is sparse and more or less limited to the SCN, in which IFN-γ can disrupt neuronal activity rhythms and acutely affect synaptic activity (Lundkvist et al., 2002). These effects are mediated by NO (Kwak et al., 2008).

Studies of the actions of cytokines on neuronal functions have mainly been based on analyses of acute or short-term effects. However, effects on neuronal function are often different when short- and long-term effects are compared. In hippocampal cell
cultures, treatment with IFN-γ for 2 days results in increased synaptic activity, whereas the effect is reversed with reduced synaptic activity after 4 weeks treatment (Vikman et al., 2001). Similar results are seen in dispersed cultures of SCN neurons (Kwak et al., 2008) with increased spontaneous firing after 2 days of exposure to the cytokine, and decreased spontaneous firing as compared to controls after 4 weeks of treatment. The mechanisms behind these changes in activity may involve long-term down-scaling of AMPA receptor expression as a response to an initial increase in activity (Vikman et al., 2001).

The difference in effects between short- and long-term exposure to cytokines is of interest in the context of emergence of symptoms during T. b. infection. Thus, homeostatic mechanisms may be able to control the inflammation up to a certain limit, but neuronal functions deteriorate when a critical point is reached, as it occurs in the advanced stage of the infection.

### 5.2.3. Prostaglandins

In addition to TNF-α and IL-1β, PGs play a key role in causing sickness behavior during infections (Matsuoka and Narumiya, 2008). This response includes fever generation, decreased food intake and somnolence.

PGs are synthesized from arachidonic acid in cellular membranes and the reaction is catalyzed by cyclooxygenase-2, which can be induced by inflammatory stimuli. PGE₂ can induce fever in addition to its anti-inflammatory effects, while PGD₂ is somnogenic and accumulates in the brain in response to sleep deprivation (Huang et al., 2007). The receptors for PGD₂ are localized to the arachnoid meninges covering the basal forebrain (Mizoguchi et al., 2001). PGD₂ is involved in the regulation of NREM sleep and the effects are mediated through adenosine after binding to adenosine A₂A receptors in the ventrolateral preoptic nuclei (Scammell et al., 1998, 2001) and adenosine A₁ receptors in the tuberomammillary nuclei (Oishi et al., 2008).

Since trypanosomes infiltrate the basal meninges, PGD₂ synthesized by trypanosomes, or by host cells in response to the infection, may not only play a role in parasite growth regulation (see Section 3.1.2), but can also be involved in causing sleep disturbances in HAT (Figarella et al., 2005; Kubata et al., 2000). However, as indicated above (see Section 4.3), sleeping sickness is in general not characterized by an increase in time spent in NREM sleep, as it would be expected if PGD₂ were the only pathogenic factor for sleep disturbances during the disease.

## 6. Other nervous system dysfunctions in African trypanosomiasis

The localization of the inflammatory response to the CVOs, diencephalic cell groups around the third ventricle and white matter (Kristensson and Bentivoglio, 1999) may also account for other signs of disease in HAT patients, which include endocrine disturbances and disorders of muscle tone and movements (Dumas and Bisser, 1999). Impotence, amenorrhea and infertility are frequent and disturbances in sex steroid and gonadotropin levels have been reported in HAT (Dumas and Bisser, 1999). Experiments on female goats have indicated that African trypanosomiasis causes an impairment in release of gonadotropin releasing hormone that reflects a hypothalamic rather than a pituitary dysfunction (Ng'wena et al., 1997).

Abnormalities in movements and muscle tone vary greatly between individuals afflicted and do not fit into classical disorder categories; slow writing may alternate with sudden brief movements, incessant gesticulation, motor instability and grimaces (Dumas and Bisser, 1999). Neuropsychiatric disturbances are common and include mood disorders, anti-social behavior and impulsive actions as well as states of confusion, delirium, paranoia and hallucinations, but the pathogenesis of these disturbances during T. b. infections has not been investigated.

Patients also develop sensory symptoms at an early stage of disease, and even a slight touch can provoke a strong pain (allodynia), which is a useful diagnostic sign of the disease called Kerandel's sign (named after the physician who described this symptom on himself) (Dumas and Bisser, 1999). Hyperalgesia is also seen early after infections with T. b. brucei in rats (Wiesenfeld-Hallin et al., 1991). PGs, either endogenous or trypanosome-derived, may be involved in pain processing both at the level of the axon terminals in the periphery and the spinal cord level. PGE₂ can induce both hyperalgesia and allodynia, while PGD₂ can induce hyperalgesia and modulate allodynia induced by PGE₂ and bicuculline (Eguchi et al., 1999; Telleria-Diaz et al., 2008). TNF-α has also been suggested to play an important role in eliciting neuropathic pain with effects both peripherally and centrally (Zimmermann, 2001), while less is known on the effects of IFN-γ on pain. However, IFN-γ can induce neuropathic pain in mice (Robertson et al., 1997) and characteristics of central sensitization in two-compartment cultures of rat DRG-spinal dorsal horn (Vikman et al., 2003) as well as in vivo (Vikman et al., 2007).

## 7. Concluding remarks

We have here highlighted recent studies showing that passage of trypanosomes and T cells into the brain is a multi-step process and that, like in experimental allergic encephalomyelitis, IFN-γ and IFN-γ-induced chemokines play a crucial to promote this entry, which may provoke the severe morbidity of the disease. We have also pointed out that by localization to basal meninges and CVOs trypanosomes may cause release of molecules that could affect the function of neurons involved in the regulation of sleep and wakefulness and of circadian rhythms. Such molecules include PGD₂, which can be produced not only by the host but also by the trypanosomes, and cytokines such as TNF-α and IFN-γ released during the immune response to the parasites. Although knowledge on the activity of sleep and wake regulatory circuits during T. b. infection is still largely incomplete, it is of special interest that the balance between sleep-promoting and wake-promoting circuits could be sensitive and vulnerable to the inflammatory signaling which hallmarks the infection.

The interactions between the trypanosome and the host’s immune system are far from being completely understood, and the complexity in interactions between immune response molecules on one hand, and the regulation of sleep and circadian rhythms on the other hand, is a major challenge for future studies. Such investigations may lead to better understanding of the pathogenesis of sleep disruption in HAT, as well as improved staging and treatment of the disease. In addition, such studies could provide fundamental novel knowledge on mechanisms behind other conditions with disturbed patterns of sleep, as seen in narcolepsy, certain neuropsychiatry disorders and during aging.
