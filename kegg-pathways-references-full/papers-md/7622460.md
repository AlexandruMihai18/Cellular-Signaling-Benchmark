The biosynthesis of 2′-deoxymugineic acid, a key phytosiderophore, was examined in association with the putative methionine recycling pathway in the roots of wheat using labeling experiments and structural analysis. Feeding with D-[1-¹³C]ribose did not result in ¹³C enrichment of 2′-deoxymugineic acid, while D-[2-¹³C]ribose resulted in ¹³C enrichment at the C-4″, -1, -4′ positions, and D-[5-¹³C]ribose did in C-1′, -4, and -1″ positions of 2′-deoxymugineic acid, respectively. Furthermore, two isotope-labeled intermediates of the methionine recycling pathway, 5-[5-²H₂]methylthioribose and 2-[1-¹³C] keto-4-methylthiobutyric acid, were synthesized, and their incorporation into 2′-deoxymugineic acids was investigated. Six deuterium atoms at the C-4, -1′, and -1″ positions of 2′-deoxymugineic acid were observed after feeding with 5-[5-²H₂]methylthioribose. Feeding with 2-[1-¹³C]keto-4-methylthiobutyric acid yielded 2′-deoxymugineic acid enriched with ¹³C at the C-4′, -1, and -4″ positions. These results demonstrated for the first time that the biosynthesis of 2′-deoxymugineic acid is associated with the methionine recycling pathway. This association system functions to recycle methionine required for continued synthesis of mugineic acids in the roots of gramineous plants.

oxymugineic acid (DMA) although the subsequent steps differ and are dependent on the plant species and cultivar (Ma and Nomoto, 1992, 1993, 1994a).

The biosynthesis of MAs is induced by iron deficiency stress in the roots (Takagi, 1976); the more severe the iron deficiency, the greater the amount of mugineic acids synthesized (Takagi *et al.*, 1984). The biosynthesis of MAs proceeds throughout the day, and the biosynthesized MAs are then accumulated in the roots until their secretion to the rhizosphere the following morning. The amount of biosynthesized MAs reaches as high as 1–2% of root dry weight. However, the concentration of L-Met, the precursor, is extremely low in the roots. As such low levels of Met can maintain the observed high rate of MAs synthesis, we hypothesized that Met may be recycled during MAs biosynthesis in a manner similar to that occurring in ethylene production in ripening apples and tomatoes (Yang and Hoffman, 1984). Several label experiments were conducted here to verify this hypothesis.

### EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES

Chemicals—D-[1-¹³C]Ribose, D-[2-¹³C]ribose, and D-[5-¹³C]ribose (99.0% ¹³C) were purchased from ICON, Mt. Marion, NY. L-[1-¹³C]Met (99.0% ¹³C) was from Isotec, Inc., Miamisburg, OH. L-Amino acid oxidase (type VI) and catalase were from Sigma.

D-5-[5-²H₂]Methylthioribose (MTR) was prepared with D-ribose as the starting material. The latter (20 g) was converted to 1-o-[5-²H₂] methyl-D-ribose acetonide (6.1 g) in four steps according to De Voss *et al.* (1994). Introduction of a methylthio group and hydrolysis were conducted as follows. To a solution of the acetonide prepared (6.1 g, 30 mmol) in pyridine (20 ml), *p*-toluenesulfonyl chloride (6 g, 31.5 mmol) was added at room temperature under N₂. The mixture was stirred for 16 h and poured into ice (100 g), then acidified with 1 M HCl at 0 °C and extracted twice with CH₂Cl₂. The combined extracts were washed with saturated NaHCO₃ and saturated NaCl, dried over MgSO₄, filtered, and evaporated under reduced pressure. The crude tosylate (10 g, 93%) was used for the next conversion without any purification. ¹H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl₃) ppm: 7.80 (2H, d, *J* = 8.4 Hz), 7.36 (2H, d, *J* = 8.4 Hz), 4.93 (1H, s), 4.60 (1H, d, *J* = 5.6 Hz), 4.53 (1H, d, *J* = 5.6 Hz), 4.30 (1H, s), 3.24 (3H, s), 2.46 (3H, s), 1.45 (3H, s), 1.23 (3H, s).

To a solution of tosylate (10 g, 28 mmol) in *N,N*-dimethylformamide (30 ml), sodium thiomethoxide (2.3 g, 33 mmol) was added at 0 °C under N₂. The mixture was stirred at 0 °C for 30 min, then allowed to warm to room temperature. After further stirring for 2.5 h, the mixture was diluted with H₂O (100 ml) and extracted twice with hexane. The combined organic extracts were dried over MgSO₄, filtered, and evaporated under reduced pressure. The corresponding D-[5-²H₂]MTR acetonide was obtained as a pale yellow oil (6.1 g, 99%), and was used for the next conversion without any purification. ¹H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl₃) ppm: 4.98 (1H, s), 4.72 (1H, d, *J* = 6 Hz), 4.61 (1H, d, *J* = 6 Hz), 4.27 (1H, s), 3.5 (3H, s), 2.15 (3H, s), 1.49 (3H, s), 1.33 (3H, s).

A mixture of the acetonide (6 g, 27.2 mmol) and Amberite IR-120B (H⁺ form) (20 g) in H₂O (80 ml) was stirred at 80 °C for 8 h, then filtered through Celite to remove the ion exchange resin. The filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure. Purification of the crude mixture by silica gel column chromatography (CH₂Cl₂-MeOH, 9:1) gave a colorless oil as a 1:2 anomerie mixture (3.2 g, 71%). ¹H NMR (400 MHz, D₂O) ppm: the major isomer; 5.23 (1H, d, *J* = 2 Hz), 4.21 (1H, dd, *J* = 5.2, 6.4 Hz), 4.07 (1H, d, *J* = 6.4 Hz), 4.02 (1H, dd, *J* = 5.2, 2 Hz), 2.17 (3H, s)

2-[1-$^{13}$C]Keto-4-methylthiobutyric acid (KMB) sodium salt was enzymatically prepared from L-[1-$^{13}$C]Met with L-amino acid oxidase (Meister, 1952). Catalase solution (containing 100 units) and L-amino acid oxidase (20 units) were added successively to a suspension of 0.5 g L-[1-$^{13}$C]Met in 30 ml of water. The pH was adjusted to 7.2 by the addition of 1 M sodium hydroxide and the solution was incubated for 3 h in a water bath at 37 °C. After the oxidation reaction was completed, the mixture was dialyzed with agitation against three changes of distilled water (1 liter each time) at 4 °C for 12 h. The combined dialysates were evaporated *in vacuo* at 40 °C to about 20 ml. The mixture was then passed through a cation exchange resin (Dowex 50, hydrogen form) to remove unconverted Met. The eluate was adjusted to pH 4.5 with 1 M NaOH, and the solution was concentrated *in vacuo* at 40 °C. Finally, 120 mg of white powder was obtained by freeze-drying. The ${}^{1}$H and ${}^{13}$C NMR data were consistent with unlabeled KMB purchased from Aldrich except that C-1 of the synthesized product was ${}^{13}$C-enriched (~96%).

Plant Growth—Wheat plants (*Triticum aestivum*, L. cv Nourin 61) were cultured hydroponically as previously reported (Ma and Nomoto, 1993). Briefly, about 80 selected seedlings (7 days old) were transplanted to continuously aerated nutrient solution in 3-liter plastic pots in an environmental chamber. Hoagland solution (0.3 strength for macronutrients and full strength for micronutrients) was used for culture. The nutrient solution was adjusted to pH 5.5 with 0.1 M KOH and replaced every 2 days. Light intensity was adjusted to 40 W m$^{-2}$, and the light/dark period and temperatures were set at 14/10 h and 17/10 °C, respectively. After 11 days, the plants were subjected to iron deficiency.

Feeding Experiments—Feeding experiments were performed with 80 plants exposed to iron deficiency for 10–12 days as described above in 3-liter Wagner pots containing Hoagland solution. As the secretion of MAs is characterized by diurnal rhythm (Takagi et al., 1984), all feeding experiments were conducted after secretion. The roots were fed with the following labeled compounds: 1) 300 $\mu$M D-[1-${}^{13}$C]ribose; 2) 300 $\mu$M D-[2-${}^{13}$C]ribose; 3) 300 $\mu$M D-[5-${}^{13}$C]ribose; 4) 250 $\mu$M D-[2-${}^{13}$C]ribose and 250 $\mu$M D-[5-${}^{13}$C]ribose; 5) 500 $\mu$M [5-${}^{2}$H$_{2}$]MTR; and 6) 200 $\mu$M [1-${}^{13}$C]KMB.

Isolation and Purification—Root washings were collected the following day by soaking the roots in distilled water (3 liters, three times) from 3 to 5 h after the onset of the light period. The root washings were then charged on Amberlite IR-120 (H$^{+}$), and the cationic fractions of 2 N NH$_{4}$OH were eluted. Subsequent chromatography on Dowex 50W-X8 was performed, and gradient eluates with ammonia-formate buffer (pH 2.5–3.1) provided a concentrated active fraction. Chelating activities were determined by the o-phenanthroline method (Takagi, 1976). Concentrated DMA fractions were finally subjected to gel filtration through Sephadex G-10 with H$_{2}$O as a solvent.

NMR Study—${}^{13}$C NMR measurements of isolated DMA (in D$_{2}$O) were obtained with a 75.5-MHz spectrometer (GE-300). 3-(trimethylsilyl)propionic acid sodium salt-$d_{4}$ was used as an external reference for calibration of the chemical shift, and assignments for ${}^{13}$C were accomplished by ${}^{13}$C-${}^{1}$H COSY, ${}^{1}$H-detected multiple-bond heteronuclear multiple-quantum coherence and ${}^{1}$H-detected heteronuclear multiple-quantum coherence experiments. Calculation of ${}^{13}$C enrichment was based on the line intensity of the C-3 position. ${}^{1}$H NMR spectra of isolated DMA (in D$_{2}$O) were recorded on a 400-MHz spectrometer (JNM-EX400), and assignments of ${}^{1}$H were accomplished by ${}^{1}$H-${}^{1}$H COSY. The ${}^{2}$H NMR spectra (in deuterium-depleted water) were measured at 61.3 MHz (JNM-EX400 spectrometer). The natural abundance of ${}^{2}$H in H$_{2}$O was used as a chemical shift reference for the ${}^{2}$H NMR experiment. As ${}^{2}$H chemical shifts correspond to ${}^{1}$H shifts, the assignment was accomplished after analysis of the corresponding proton spectra.

**RESULTS AND DISCUSSION**

2′-Deoxymugineic acid is the first phytosiderophore to be biosynthesized and serves as a precursor for other MAs (Fig. 1) (Ma and Nomoto, 1993, 1994a). Furthermore, as significant differences in solubilization and uptake of iron were not observed among different MAs (Ma et al., 1993), DMA is suggested as a key phytosiderophore. Since the aim of the present study was to determine how L-Met is derived during MAs biosynthesis, wheat, which secretes only DMA, was used as a model plant.

2′-Deoxymugineic acid is biosynthesized from three molecules of L-Met (Kawai et al., 1988; Ma and Nomoto, 1993, 1994b). A series of label studies demonstrated that the 4-C moieties (C-1, -2, -3, and -4) of three Met contribute to the skeleton of DMA while the methylthio group does not (Ma and Nomoto, 1994b). The amount of secreted DMA reached about 1.5 $\mu$mol plant$^{-1}$ day$^{-1}$ on the 12th day after commencement of iron deficiency, and usually more DMA was biosynthesized than was secreted since some DMA is retained within the roots. Despite this active biosynthesis of DMA in the wheat roots, the level of its first precursor, L-Met, was negligible.

Generally, the level of Met is low in higher plants, being about 1/100 those of other amino acids such as Asp and Glu. The pathway leading to formation of L-Met in higher plants is Asp → Hse → o-phosphohomoserine → homocysteine → Met (Giovanelli et al., 1974); however, there is no evidence to show that this pathway is stimulated during DMA biosynthesis. Also, the fate of the methylthio group derived from L-Met when it is converted to DMA is not known. Furthermore, Met biosynthesized by the above pathway is usually used for protein synthesis, and its activated form, S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet), is used for methylation and polyamine biosynthesis. If most biosynthesized Met is additionally consumed for DMA biosynthesis, the basal metabolic pathways will not function. Therefore, it is reasonable to consider that Met is biosynthesized by some other pathway to maintain the active biosynthesis of DMA.

Methionine also serves as a precursor of ethylene (Yang and Hoffman, 1984), and it has been established that Met is recycled during ethylene production as shown in Fig. 1. The first step of the recycling pathway is the activation of Met by ATP to give AdoMet. S-Adenosylmethionine is fragmented to give 5′-methylthioadenosine and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid, which is then converted to ethylene. 5′-Methylthioadenosine is hydrolyzed to MTR and adenine, and phosphorylation of MTR by MTR kinase yields 5-methylthioribose-1-phosphate. Loss of the phosphate group of 5-methylthioribose-1-phosphate, concurrent with the rearrangement of the ribose carbon atoms, leads to the synthesis of KMB. In the final step of the sequence, KMB is converted to Met via transamination. The overall result of this cycle is that the ribose moiety of ATP (carbons 2′, 3′, 4′, and 5′) furnishes the 4-carbon moiety of Met, and the CH$_{3}$S group of Met is conserved for continued regeneration of Met.

To examine whether this Met recycling pathway is operative during DMA biosynthesis in wheat roots, incorporation experiments using ribose labeled with ${}^{13}$C at different positions were carried out in wheat roots under iron deficient conditions. After feeding with ${}^{13}$C-labeled ribose, ATP labeled with ${}^{13}$C will be formed. If Met used for DMA biosynthesis is regenerated by the recycling pathway (Fig. 1), carbon 1 of the ribose moiety would not be incorporated into DMA because it is degraded into HCO$_{2}^{-}$ during the cycle, while carbons 2, 3, 4, and 5 of the ribose moiety would incorporate into specific positions of DMA. When 300 $\mu$M D-[1-${}^{13}$C]ribose was fed to the wheat roots, 18.5 mg of purified DMA were obtained. The ${}^{13}$C NMR study showed that there was no ${}^{13}$C enrichment at any carbon of DMA (Fig. 2B). When roots were fed D-[2-${}^{13}$C]ribose under the same condition, the C-4″, -1, and -4′ positions of isolated DMA (18.2 mg) were ${}^{13}$C-enriched 1.86-, 1.71-, and 1.84-fold, respectively, by comparison of their peak heights with those of unlabeled DMA (Fig. 2, A and C). Feeding with D-[5-${}^{13}$C]ribose also resulted in ${}^{13}$C enrichment of DMA (44.4 mg) by 1.81-, 1.68-, and 2.07-fold at the C-1′, -4, and -1″ positions, respectively (Fig. 2D). A dual

Spectra were measured with a 75.5-MHz spectrometer (in D$_2$O). Refer to Fig. 1 for numbering. * represents the positions enriched by ${}^{13}$C.

label experiment using equal concentration of D-[2-${}^{13}$C]ribose and D-[5-${}^{13}$C]ribose showed that ${}^{13}$C was equally incorporated into the specific positions of DMA (47.6 mg) (Fig. 2E). Although the pool of ribose is very large in the plants, the selective incorporation of ${}^{13}$C-labeled ribose to DMA suggests that Met is recycled during DMA biosynthesis as speculated (Fig. 1).

To further confirm this speculation, two isotope-labeled intermediates of the Met cycling pathway, [5-${}^{2}$H$_2$]MTR and [1-${}^{13}$C]KMB, were synthesized. 5-[5-${}^{2}$H$_2$]Methylthioribose was synthesized according to the scheme shown in Fig. 3. If the Met cycling pathway is associated with DMA biosynthesis, the label (${}^{2}$H) of [5-${}^{2}$H$_2$]MTR would be incorporated into C-4, -1', and -1" positions of DMA. In addition, in a previous study, when Met labeled with ${}^{2}$H at the C-4 position was fed to the wheat roots, 6 deuterium atoms from 3 molecules of ${}^{2}$H-labeled Met were completely incorporated into DMA (Ma and Nomoto, 1993). Therefore, 6 deuterium atoms would be similarly observed when fed with [5-${}^{2}$H$_2$]MTR if the above speculation is correct. When [5-${}^{2}$H$_2$]MTR was fed to the wheat roots, ${}^{2}$H signal of the isolated DMA (21.8 mg) was observed on the ${}^{2}$H NMR spectrum (Fig. 4). Relative peak intensities at 4.05, 3.95, 3.35, and 3.21 ppm were, respectively, approximated to 1:1:2:2, and a total of 6 deuterium atoms were observed. Based on the ${}^{1}$H NMR assignment, these peaks corresponded to the deuterium atoms at the C-4, C-1', and C-1" positions, respectively. As can be seen in Fig. 4, both the numbers and positions of ${}^{2}$H incorporated are completely consistent with the above speculation, demonstrating that the Met recycling pathway is operative during DMA biosynthesis.

2-[1-${}^{13}$C]Keto-4-methylthiobutyric acid was enzymatically synthesized from [1-${}^{13}$C]Met. If the Met recycling pathway is related to DMA biosynthesis, [1-${}^{13}$C]KMB would be converted into [1-${}^{13}$C]Met by transamination, resulting in ${}^{13}$C enrichment of three carboxyl groups in DMA. When roots were fed [1-${}^{13}$C]KMB, 22.8 mg of DMA were isolated. The results of ${}^{13}$C NMR analysis showed that the C-4", -1, and -4' positions were ${}^{13}$C-enriched by 3.66-, 3.64-, and 3.94-fold, respectively (Fig. 5). This result further confirmed the relationship between the Met

recycling pathway and DMA biosynthesis.

The above findings demonstrate for the first time that DMA biosynthesis is associated with the Met recycling pathway in wheat roots (Fig. 1). Our results also suggest that the Met recycling pathway is not limited to ripening apples and tomatoes but is also active in wheat roots. This pathway allows

continuous generation of ATP resulting in the continuous synthesis of DMA in wheat roots even where the Met pool is small, enabling DMA to be synthesized without depleting the cellular Met pools.

L-Methionine was also found to be activated into AdoMet first by ATP before leading to DMA in vitro (Shojima et al., 1990). In the case of ethylene biosynthesis, AdoMet is fragmented to 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid and 5′-methylthioadenosine, and the latter enters the Met recycling pathway. 1-Aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid is not incorporated into DMA, and azetidine-2-carboxylic acid has been suggested to be an intermediate (Ma and Nomoto, 1994b). This suggests that AdoMet splits into azetidine-2-carboxylic acid and 5′-methylthioadenosine during DMA biosynthesis (Fig. 1).

The process of iron acquisition by some gramineous plants includes MAs biosynthesis inside the roots, diurnal rhythmic secretion of MAs to the rhizosphere, effective solubilization of insoluble iron in soils by chelation, and specific uptake of MAs-iron complexes. To date, only some gramineous plants have been found to have the ability to biosynthesize MAs. The strategy of iron acquisition by secreting MAs adopted by gramineous plants has advantages over others (such as those in dicotyledonous and nongramineous monocotyledonous plants) for adaptation to calcareous soils from an ecological point of view

(Römheld and Marschner, 1987). Therefore, this strategy has been targeted for breeding crops resistant to iron deficiency, and some attempts have been made to isolate genes encoding MAs biosynthesis. The present results represent important information for plant breeders that genes responsible for both MAs biosynthesis and Met cycling should be considered.
