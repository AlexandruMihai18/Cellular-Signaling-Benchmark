**Abstract.** To determine the substrate range capability of *Sphingomonas paucimobilis* strain EPA505, a number of aromatic compounds were tested as potential growth substrates. Strain EPA505 grew on phenanthrene, naphthalene, fluoranthene, toluene, benzoic acid, 2,3- and 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acids, 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene, anthracene, 2-hydroxy-3-naphthoic acid and 1-hydroxy-2-naphthoic acid, salicylic acid, and catechol. Strain EPA505 was unable to grow on coumarine 3-carboxylic acid, naphthalene dicarboxylic acid, acenaphthene, chrysene, pyrene, benzo[b]fluoranthene, and fluorene. Catabolic products were not detected or identified when the bacterium was incubated with coumarine 3-carboxylic acid, naphthalene dicarboxylic acid,acenaphthene, chrysene, or benzo[b]fluoranthene. Dihydroxypyrene, the *ortho* ring fission product of pyrene, and 10-hydroxy-1-phenanthroic acid were detected when the bacterium was incubated with pyrene. The open rings of benzo[b]fluoranthene, hydroxyacephenanthric acid, hydroxyacephenanthrene, and phenanthrene anhydride, catabolites of benzo[b]fluoranthene degradation, were detected with Tn5 mutants of EPA505. With strain EPA505, both 9-fluorenone and an open ring fission product accumulated during incubation with fluorene. Other catabolites beyond the open ring of fluorene were detected, specifically dihydroxyfluorene, hydroxy-9-fluorenone, dihydroxy-9-fluorenone, hydroxyindane, and a putative glutathione-conjugated benzylhydride. Benzylhydride appeared to be a final end product of fluorene degradation by strain EPA505.

Considering the persistence of these compounds in the environment and toxicity to animals, it is important to understand the fate of PAHs in the environment. However, the oxidation products that occur during bacterial metabolism of PAHs are usually not monitored in the environment. Generally, catabolic pathways for PAH utilization by bacteria have been inferred based on those identified with bacteria that utilize low molecular weight PAHs such as naphthalene and phenanthrene or partially degraded PAHs.

*Sphingomonas paucimobilis* EPA505 was isolated from a creosote waste site in Gulf Breeze, Florida (Mueller *et al.* 1990). They also reported that strain EPA505 could grow on 2,3-dimethylnaphthalene, anthracene, phenanthrene, fluoranthene, and benzo[b]fluorene and catalyzes incomplete degradation of biphenyl, fluorene, anthraquinone, pyrene, and chrysene. More recently, it was observed that this strain could partially degrade other high molecular weight PAHs, specifically, benz[a]anthracene, benzo[a]pyrene, benzo[b]fluoranthene, and dibenz[a,h]anthracene (Ye *et al.* 1996). Catabolic pathways for the degradation of fluoranthene, naphthalene, phenanthrene, and anthracene were reported by Story *et al.* (2001). Since the identification of strain EPA505, several other sphingomonads have been found and a key characteristic of this genus is its ability to degrade a wide range of substituted and unsubstituted monocyclic aromatic compounds as well as PAHs (Kim and Zylstra 1999; Romine *et al.* 1999a). This catabolic versatility of sphingomonads goes beyond that reported for pseudomonads in extent and range of compounds used or partially degraded. Researchers are just beginning to focus on the metabolic, physiologic, and genetic mechanisms involved in the prolific catabolic capability of sphingomonads.

Objectives of the present study were (1) to determine the range of aromatics that could support growth or be transformed by strain EPA505 and (2) to identify potential toxic transformation products.

PAHs and standards were dissolved in acetone and filter sterilized using autoclaved 0.2-$\mu$m nylon acrodiscs (Fisher Scientific). Acetone, methanol, acetonitrile, and ethyl acetate were obtained from Fisher Scientific. Solvents used for HPLC were filtered through a 0.2-$\mu$m nylon membrane (Fisher Scientific).

Organisms and Growth Conditions

Bacterial strains used in this study are given in Table 1. Strain EPA 505 was maintained on Luria-Bertani agar (LBA). Tn5 mutants were maintained on LBA supplemented with 50 $\mu$g·ml$^{-1}$ kanamycin (Km). Growth characteristics of strain EPA 505 with each aromatic compound were tested in mineral salts medium (MSM) supplemented with 0.8% agar and 0.2 mg·ml$^{-1}$ Tween-80. A hole was poked into the agar at one edge of a plate and served as a well for adding an aromatic compound. One hundred milligrams of each compound was sterilized by dissolving in acetone and filtering through a 0.2-$\mu$m nylon disc into a sterile glass vial. Twenty microliters of a compound was added directly to a well. Acetone was allowed to evaporate for 24 h, after which strain EPA 505 and mutant strains were radially streaked onto the agar and incubated at 28°C for up to 8 days. No growth was observed in controls without a test compound.

For analyses of PAH-derived metabolites produced in culture medium (final concentration, $\sim$5 × 10$^7$ cells ml$^{-1}$), cells were incubated at 28°C in MSM supplemented with 0.1 mg·ml$^{-1}$ PAH and incubated for 5–72 h. MSM composition, extraction of intermediate metabolites and PAHs, and analytical procedures have been described (Story et al. 2001).

**Accumulation of Fluorene-Derived Catabolites with S. paucimobilis EPA505**

Strain EPA505 did not grow when fluorene was provided as a sole carbon source (Table 2), but there was evidence for fluorene transformation; the colorless medium turned bright yellow and eventually to a deep-orange color after 72 h of incubation. Two compounds accumulated in culture medium that were detected by HPLC. One compound had an HPLC retention time of 18.2 min and UV absorption spectrum identical to a standard for 9-fluorenone (Figure 5 and inset), which is a bright-yellow compound. GC-MS verified the identity of 9-fluorenone with a GC retention time of 16.7 and a M+ at m/z 180 and a major fragment ion at m/z 152 (Figure 6A). The other compound had a HPLC retention time of 11.4 min and a UV absorption spectrum shown in Figure 5 and inset. GC-MS revealed several other fluorene-derived catabolites including dihydroxyfluorene (Figure 6B), hydroxy-9-fluorenone (Table

Discussion

The purpose of the present study was to determine the range of aromatic compounds *Sphingomonas paucimobilis* EPA505 can utilize for growth or transformation. Strain EPA505 grows on a variety of monocyclic and dicyclic aromatic compounds that are known intermediate catabolites of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) metabolism (Story et al. 2001). The substituted monocyclic compounds, toluene (TOL) and 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB), also supported growth. The TOL degradative pathway has been characterized in pseudomonads (Worsey and Williams 1975). Based on DNA sequence homologies, a TOL-like operon was found for *S*. *yanoikuyae* B1 and

S. aromaticavorans (Kim and Zylstra 1994; Romine et al. 1999b). It is likely that strain EPA505 shares a similar organization of TOL degradative genes and catabolic pathway as these two species. Growth on CDNB indicates that strain EPA505 has dehalogenase activity that has not yet been extensively studied in this bacterium. Naphthol and 1,8-naphthalene dicarboxylic acid (1,8-NDA) did not support growth of strain EPA505 and tranformation products were not detected, demonstrating a level of specificity of the ring hydroxylating dioxygenase. Interestingly, 1,8-NDA was found as a degradation product during fluoranthene metabolism of strain EPA505 (Story et al. 2001), indicating that this may be a dead end

product, 1,8-NDA was recovered as an accumulated oxidation product during acenaphthene or acenaphthalene degradation by *Pseudomonas* spp., *Alcaligenes* spp., and *Sphingomonas yanoikuyae* B1, and it is not metabolized further (Selifonov et al. 1996). To date there are no reports on further metabolism of 1,8-NDA by bacteria that can utilize acenaphthene or fluoranthene as a sole carbon source. Strain EPA505 did not grow on coumarin 3-carboxylic acid, but it did accumulate a reddish-orange compound; however, this degradation product was not identified.

*S. paucimobilis* EPA505 (Story et al. 2001) shares a similar or identical fluoranthene degradative pathway as an *Alcaligenes denitrificans* strain (Weissenfels et al. 1991). However,

*A. denitrificans*, unlike strain EPA505, does not grow on anthracene or phenanthrene and accumulates, respectively, 2,3- or 1,2-hydroxynaphthoic acid as dead end products. Furthermore, PAH degrading pseudomonads commonly utilize naphthalene, anthracene, and phenanthrene but not high molecular weight PAHs such as fluoranthene or pyrene and, less often, PAHs with a cyclopentane ring such as acenaphthene. Parales et al. (2000) showed that site-directed mutagenesis of the naphthalene dioxygenase gene of a *Pseudomonas* sp., to produce single amino acid substitutions in the active site, significantly altered the stereospecificity of this enzyme, resulting in more hydroxylation at different sites on naphthalene. This may be one factor that contributes to the broader substrate range of

ring hydroxylating dioxygenases of PAH degrading sphing-
monads.

On the other hand, acenaphthene (ACE), chrysene (CHR),
pyrene (PYR), benzo[b]fluoranthene (B[b]F), and fluorene
(FLE) do not support growth of strain EPA505. Degradation
products of ACE and CHR were not detected, however, several
oxidation products of PYR, B[b]F, and FLE were identified. It
was expected that at least the initial oxidation products of ACE
and CHR would occur. Lack of transformation of these two
compounds suggests a unique substrate specificity of the ring
hydroxylating dioxygenase.

Lack of growth on high molecular weight PAHs, PYR and
B[b]F, as sole carbon sources may be due to low water solu-
bility of these compounds where growth is limited by a slow
dissolution rate. In this study, PYR and B[b]F were provided as
sole carbon sources incorporated into agar medium that con-
tained Tween-80 to increase their concentration; this still did
not support growth. Dihydroxypyrene, 1,10-phenanthrenedi-
carboxylic acid (open ring structure of PYR), and 10-hydroxy-
1-phenanthroic acid were detected as intermediates when strain
EPA505 was incubated with PYR. The occurrence of 10-
hydroxy-1-phenanthroic acid indicates that the *ortho* ring fis-
sion occurred on PYR and the open ring structure of PYR is
likely the *ortho* form. The results presented in this study are
consistent with the degradation of pyrene proposed for strain
EPA505 by Yo *et al.* (2000). Catabolic products of B[b]F were
not detected with strain EPA505 but were detectable with Tn5
mutants *pahC132* and *pahD104*. This suggests that strain
EPA505 transforms B[b]F to a later (nondetected) intermedi-
ate(s) than that accumulated by the Tn5 mutants. Hydroxyace-
phenanthroic acid and hydroxyacephenanthrene were detected
with *pahC132*, and phenanthrene anhydride and the open ring
of B[b]F were detected with *pahD104* during incubation with
PYR. Identification of hydroxyacephenanthrene and phenan-
threne anhydride further support that removal of the carboxyl
from the cyclopentane ring followed by a dioxygenase reaction
are common mechanisms involved in further transformation of
PAHs with a cyclopentane moiety by *S.* *paucimobilis* EPA505.

Fluorene has greater water solubility than pyrene, B[b]F, and
fluoranthene; however, fluorene does not support growth,
whereas fluoranthene does (Mueller *et al.* 1990). Hydroxyin-
dane was found during GC analysis as a final end product when
strain EPA505 was incubated with fluorene. Interestingly,
9-fluorenone and trans-*o*-hydroxyindanylidene pyruvate (open
ring of fluorene) accumulated, indicating a rather unbalanced
metabolism during fluorene degradation compared to fluoran-
thene. Based on the identification of dihydroxyfluorene, the
open ring of fluorene, and hydroxyindane, a fluorene degrada-
tive pathway is proposed (Figure 7). The compounds in large
parentheses (benzylanhdyride and carboxymethylbenzylcar-
boxylic acid) are predicted and were inferred from the fluoran-
thene catabolic pathway (Story *et al.* 2001). Other fluorene
catabolites were identified that indicated a less favored path-
way of attack by a dioxygenase that incorporates one molecule
of oxygen at carbon 9 on fluorene (9-fluorenone) followed by
mono- or dioxygenation on the adjacent benzene ring (hy-
droxy-9-fluorenone and dihydroxy-9-fluorenone, respectively)
(Figure 7). A naphthalene utilizing *Pseudomonas* sp. has been
shown to catalyze mono- and dioxygenation of fluorene result-
ing in at least four isomers of hydroxyfluorene, and hydroxy-
indane was recovered as well (Selifonov *et al.* 1996). This

pseudomonad and *Sphingomonas yanoikuyae* B1 transform
acenaphthene to the dead end product acenaphthenehydride.
PAH anhydrides were consistently found with strain EPA505
during metabolism of fluoranthene (Story *et al.* 2001) and
B[b]F, and benzylanhdyride is proposed during degradation of
fluorene (Figure 7). The structures in large parentheses are
predicted in the alternate pathway for further metabolism of
dihydroxy-9-fluorenone and hydroxy-9-fluorenone, however,
the open ring structures of 9-fluorenone and dihydroxybiphe-
nylcarboxylic acid were not detected. A putative glutathione
conjugate of a fluorene metabolite (benzylanhdyride) was de-
tected, and the deuterated form of this compound was ob-
served. The gene encoding glutathione-S-transferase (GST) has
been found with several species of PAH degrading sphin-
gomonads including *S.* *paucimobilis* EPA505 (Lloyd-Jones and
Lau 1997); however, the function of GST in PAH metabolism
by this bacterium has not been determined. GST has been
shown to have a major role in PAH metabolism by fungi
(Bezalel *et al.* 1997; Sack *et al.* 1997). It is well documented
that GST plays a role in detoxification and/or metabolism of
xenobiotics that can cause oxidative damage to cell membranes
and DNA of both prokaryotes and eukaryotes (Hayes and
Pulford 1995; Vuilleumier 1997). Strain EPA505 also does not
grow on coumarine 3-carboxylic acid that is structurally similar
to benzylanhdyride but did accumulate an unidentified pinkish–
orange metabolite. This compound or aromatic anhydride may

be a substrate for GST and could be useful for a more definitive identification of glutathione conjugates. Aromatic ring conjugates that were recovered during metabolism of B[b]F and fluorene appear not to be degraded further by strain EPA505. These anhydrides are formed by a spontaneous reaction between two carboxylic acid groups on the open cyclohexane ring (Selifonov *et al.* 1996); other bacteria have not been identified that can degrade these metabolites.

In this study and a previous study (*Story et al.* 2001) metabolic pathways for the degradation of fluoranthene, phenanthrene, naphthalene, and anthracene were identified. Although these PAHs were completely degraded by *S.* paucimobilis EPA505, transient accumulation of intermediates were detected (i.e., hydroxymethylbenzene, salicylic acid, and catechol). Furthermore, high molecular weight PAHs including pyrene, B[b]F, and fluorene were partially degraded and accumulated a number of dead end products. Some of these oxidation products are known carcinogens or have structures similar to known carcinogens and hormonal compounds (*Clements et al.* 1994). Interestingly, strain EPA505 also possesses GST activity (Lloyd-Jones and Lau 1997) that may protect the bacterium from potent oxidizing agents that are produced during degradation of PAHs. Environmental factors that uncouple any reaction in these degradative pathways could further increase the concentration and residence time of oxidized products in soil and water. These oxidized products are also more water soluble and therefore more easily spread through soil to ground water, thus posing a greater threat to the health of mammalian animals.
