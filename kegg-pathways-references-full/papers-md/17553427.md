## SUMMARY

Endocannabinoids (eCBs) have emerged as key activity-dependent signals that, by activating presynaptic cannabinoid receptors (i.e., CB1) coupled to $G_{i/o}$ protein, can mediate short-term and long-term synaptic depression (LTD). While the presynaptic mechanisms underlying eCB-dependent short-term depression have been identified, the molecular events linking CB1 receptors to LTD are unknown. Here we show in the hippocampus that long-term, but not short-term, eCB-dependent depression of inhibitory transmission requires presynaptic cAMP/PKA signaling. We further identify the active zone protein RIM1α as a key mediator of both CB1 receptor effects on the release machinery and eCB-dependent LTD in the hippocampus. Moreover, we show that eCB-dependent LTD in the amygdala and hippocampus shares major mechanistic features. These findings reveal the signaling pathway by which CB1 receptors mediate long-term effects of eCBs in two crucial brain structures. Furthermore, our results highlight a conserved mechanism of presynaptic plasticity in the brain.

## INTRODUCTION

The endogenous ligands of cannabinoid receptors (endocannabinoids, or eCBs) are important regulators of synaptic function (Alger, 2002; Freund et al., 2003) mediating short- and long-term plasticity at both excitatory and inhibitory synapses in a number of brain structures (for a recent review, see Chevaleyre et al., 2006). These lipid signaling molecules are generally synthesized “on demand” from membrane precursors in the postsynaptic cell, and diffuse retrogradely to the presynaptic terminal (Piomelli, 2003). Once bound to the presynaptic cannabinoid receptor CB1, eCBs suppress transmitter release either transiently (<1 min) (Diana and Marty, 2004; Kreitzer and Regehr,
seconds to minutes, a process likely mediated by the G<sub>β/γ</sub> subunits (Wilson et al., 2001). One of the most striking requirements distinguishing I-LTD induction from that of DSI is the extended duration of CB1 receptor activity (Chevaleyre and Castillo, 2003). This increased time requirement for I-LTD induction could reflect the recruitment of a distinct signaling pathway by CB1 receptors. A likely candidate pathway for I-LTD is the α<sub>i/o</sub> effector limb of the CB1 receptor G protein signaling cascade, i.e., the cAMP/Protein Kinase A (PKA) pathway (Childers and Deadwyler, 1996; Howlett et al., 1986). Indeed, modulation of the cAMP/PKA pathway has been implicated in other presynaptic forms of plasticity in both hippocampus (Huang et al., 1994; Tzounopoulos et al., 1998; Villacres et al., 1998; Weisskopf et al., 1994) and cerebellum (Linden and Ahn, 1999; Salin et al., 1996; Storm et al., 1998). A common theme of these long-term forms of plasticity is that their expression mechanism relies on changes in the transmitter release machinery (Castillo et al., 1997, 2002; Lonart et al., 2003; Tzounopoulos et al., 1998). In particular, the active zone protein RIM1α (Wang et al., 1997) has been shown to be necessary for PKA-dependent LTP at several excitatory synapses, including the mossy fiber to CA3 pyramidal cell synapse (Castillo et al., 2002), the parallel fiber to Purkinje cell synapse (Castillo et al., 2002; Lonart et al., 2003), and the Schaffer collateral to CA1 pyramidal synapse (Huang et al., 2005). These previous studies prompted us to ask whether eCB-LTD also involves downregulation of the cAMP/PKA pathway, a RIM1α-dependent modification of the release machinery, or both.

In this study, we compared the dependence of DSI and I-LTD on both cAMP/PKA signaling and the active zone protein RIM1α. We found that hippocampal I-LTD, but not DSI, requires cAMP/PKA signaling and RIM1α. In addition, we report that CB1 receptors, via PKA, regulate GABA release downstream of VGCC-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, and that both CB1 receptors and PKA can target the release machinery in a RIM1α-dependent manner. Furthermore, we tested the generality of these mechanisms in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) where eCBs mediate I-LTD (Azad et al., 2004; Marsicano et al., 2002). At inhibitory synapses in the BLA, we also found that CB1 receptors target the release machinery via PKA and that RIM1α is necessary for I-LTD. Taken together, these findings raise the intriguing prospect of a core mechanism of presynaptic plasticity spanning multiple brain areas and synapse types (i.e., excitatory and inhibitory), and also provide a potential substrate for the hippocampus- and amygdala-dependent memory deficits reported in RIM1α KO mice (Powell et al., 2004).

## RESULTS

During hippocampal DSI, CB1 receptor-mediated block of the N-type VGCC is believed to depress GABA release (Varma et al., 2002; Wilson et al., 2001). On the other hand, the CB1 receptors’ effectors during I-LTD are com-

(B) Incubation and continuous application of either of two different PKA inhibitors (10 μM H89, n = 4; 1 μm PKI 14-22 amide, n = 7) also impaired I-LTD induction.

pletely unknown. Because CB1 receptors are G<sub>i/o</sub> coupled (Howlett et al., 2002) and have a well-documented inhibitory effect on adenyl cyclase and PKA activity (Childers and Deadwyler, 1996; Howlett et al., 1986), we tested whether the cAMP/PKA pathway might be involved in eCB-mediated long-term plasticity in slices of mouse hippocampus. First, cAMP levels were raised by continuous activation of adenyl cyclase with forskolin (FSK), a manipulation that also increased the amplitude of evoked inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) by 25.0% ± 5.4% (n = 6). Theta-burst stimulation (TBS) of presynaptic inputs, which triggered I-LTD under control conditions (Figure 1A; 23.8% ± 2.0%, n = 4), failed in the presence of FSK (Figure 1A; 3.8% ± 3.1%, n = 5, p = 0.0014). Changes in cAMP level can affect synaptic transmission through both PKA-dependent and -independent actions (Seino

and Shibasaki, 2005), so we next tested the involvement of PKA with two different blockers, the cell-permeable myristoylated form of PKA inhibitor 14-22 amide (PKI) and H89. I-LTD was markedly reduced after incubating slices for >30 min with either of these compounds (Figure 1B; PKA blocker 5.2% ± 1.8%, n = 11, 7 cells in PKI and 4 cells in H89 [data were combined since no differential effect was observed by these blockers] versus 20.8% ± 2.0%, n = 6 in interleaved control slice, p < 0.0001). This result likely represents an occlusion of I-LTD, given that CB1 receptors can downregulate PKA activity and that PKA inhibition acutely depresses synaptic transmission (see below, Figure 5B).

In order to rule out a postsynaptic role for PKA in I-LTD induction, I-LTD was also tested with the nonmyristoylated, membrane impermeant form of PKI, delivered to the postsynaptic cell via the recording pipette. Blocking postsynaptic PKA did not affect I-LTD (Figure 1B), indicating that the PKA requirement is presynaptic. In marked contrast to these effects on long-term plasticity, neither FSK nor PKA blockers altered DSI in the same CA1 pyramidal cells (Figure 1C), in accordance with previous findings (Morishita et al., 1998; Wilson et al., 2001). We obtained results similar to these with FSK and PKA inhibitors for I-LTD and DSI in brain slices from rats (data not shown). We considered the possibility that interfering with cAMP/PKA signaling blocked I-LTD by reducing glutamate release, which is the initial trigger for I-LTD (Chevaleyre and Castillo, 2003). However, neither PKA blockers nor FSK depressed excitatory synaptic transmission (i.e., CA1 field potentials) after 50 min bath application (PKI: 1.3% ± 2.1%, n = 6; H89: –0.5% ± 3.2%, n = 5; FSK: 24.4% ± 5.3%, n = 4; data not shown). Taken together, these results show that the presynaptic cAMP/PKA pathway is required downstream of CB1 receptor activation for long-term, but not short-term, eCB-mediated plasticity.

If CB1 receptors can regulate GABA release, as shown above, by two divergent signaling cascades, it stands to reason that this receptor may also independently target distinct steps of neurotransmitter release. In the hippocampus, previous studies have suggested that CB1 receptors suppress GABA release mainly by targeting VGCCs rather than the vesicle release machinery (Hoffman and Lupica, 2000; Varma et al., 2002; Wilson et al., 2001; Wilson and Nicoll, 2001). In the cerebellum, however, CB1 receptors can target the release machinery in a manner that presumably depends on basal Ca²⁺ levels in the presynaptic terminal (Yamasaki et al., 2006). For this reason, we chose to examine miniature IPSCs (mIPSCs) in CA1 in the presence of 5 mM extracellular Ca²⁺, blocking action potentials and VGCCs with 500 nM TTX and 100 μM CdCl₂, respectively. Application of 5 μM WIN 55,212-2 (WIN), a CB1 receptor agonist, significantly decreased mIPSC frequency in the hippocampus (Figure 2A; 17.6% ± 1.2%, n = 5, p = 0.0002). This effect was blocked by a CB1 receptor antagonist, AM 251 or SR 141716 (Figure 2A). In addition, WIN had no effect on mIPSC amplitude (Figure 2B), indicating a presynaptic action.

The function of CB1 receptors on GABA release. As the cAMP/PKA pathway is required for I-LTD induction, we tested whether it is also involved in CB1 receptor-mediated depression of mIPSC frequency. In presence of FSK, mIPSC frequency was increased (by 58.1%, n = 6, p = 0.003) and WIN was unable to depress mIPSC frequency (Figure 2C). Furthermore, blocking PKA with H89 reduced mIPSC frequency to the same extent as WIN alone, and the effects of WIN and H89 did not summate, again suggesting occlusion (Figure 2C). These results show that in addition to presynaptic VGCCs, CB1 receptors can also target the release machinery via the cAMP/PKA pathway.

What lies downstream of PKA in I-LTD? To address this question, we tested whether RIM1α, a presynaptic active zone protein (Schoch et al., 2002; Wang et al., 1997) that is phosphorylated by PKA (Lonart et al., 2003) and is required for presynaptic forms of LTP at excitatory synapses (Castillo et al., 2002; Lonart et al., 2003), could also be involved in I-LTD. Notably, I-LTD induced by a TBS was abolished in RIM1α KO mice (Figure 3A; 3.9% ± 1.3%, n = 18 cells, 10 KO mice, versus 19.1% ± 1.8%, n = 14 cells, 9 WT mice, p < 0.001). This effect does not seem to result from deficient CB1 receptor function, as DSI remained unaffected in RIM1α KO mice (Figure 3B). The differential sensitivity of I-LTD and DSI to RIM1α deletion parallels the differential involvement of the cAMP/PKA pathway in these processes and supports the idea that different

targets downstream of the CB1 receptor mediate short- and long-term eCB-plasticity.

I-LTD is a heterosynaptic form of plasticity triggered by both glutamate release from Schaffer collaterals and postsynaptic activation of group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR-I), which stimulates eCB production (Chevaleyre and Castillo, 2003). Because the probability of glutamate release in area CA1 of the hippocampus is reduced in RIM1α KO mice (Schoch et al., 2002), the loss of I-LTD could simply be due to a subthreshold activation of mGluRs. We addressed this possibility in several ways. First, we found that I-LTD was normal using 10 μM Cd²⁺, a nonselective VGCC blocker, which depressed excitatory transmission in WT mice to a level similar to that of KO mice (~50%, data not shown) (Schoch et al., 2002). Second, a 10 min bath application of the mGluR-I agonist DHPG (50 μM), which bypasses glutamate release and also triggers I-LTD upon DHPG washout (Chevaleyre and Castillo, 2003; Edwards et al., 2006), failed to elicit I-LTD in KO mice (Figure 4A; 4.9% ± 3.3%, n = 5 cells, 4 KO mice, versus 21.7% ± 1.5%, n = 5 cells, 4 WT mice, p = 0.0002). Finally, we directly tested the effect of CB1 receptor acti-

vation with the CB1 receptor agonist WIN. Because CB1 receptor agonists are lipophilic compounds with slow diffusion kinetics in acute brain slices, for these experiments we monitored extracellular field IPSPs (fIPSPs) (Arai et al., 1995; Lambert et al., 1991), which allow for stable long-term recordings (see Experimental Procedures). In WT mice, bath application of WIN, subsequently chased with the CB1 receptor antagonist SR 141716, led to a lasting depression of fIPSPs (Figure 4B; 23.9% ± 2.8%, n = 4, 3 mice, p = 0.0006). In RIM1α KO mice, WIN acutely depressed the fIPSP to the same extent as that observed in WT mice, but fIPSP amplitude subsequently recovered

PKA by H89 depressed GABAergic synaptic transmission at CB1R+ inputs, a depression (including failures) that was significantly attenuated in RIM1α KO mice (Figures 5A and 5B; 35.3% ± 5.8%, n = 8 cells, 8 WT mice versus 15.2% ± 4.8%, n = 9 cells, 8 KO mice, p < 0.01). In the absence of PKA blocker, transmission remained stable throughout the experiment (Figure 5B; 95.8% ± 4.7%, n = 7), suggesting that the remaining depression in KO mice probably reflects an action of PKA on targets other than RIM1α. A major component of the H89-mediated depression of GABA release is likely RIM1α dependent, as indicated by the increase in failure rate and paired-pulse ratio in WT, but not in KO, mice (Figures 5C and 5D).

To investigate whether the CB1 receptor-mediated effect on GABAergic release machinery (Figure 2A) similarly requires RIM1α, in addition to cAMP/PKA signaling, we tested the effect of CB1 receptor activation on mIPSC activity in WT and KO mice. Again, in order to rule out a contribution of VGCC inhibition to a CB1 receptor-mediated effect, these experiments were performed in the presence of 100 μM Cd2+. As shown in Figure 6, WIN-induced depression of mIPSC activity was absent in RIM1α KO mice (Figure 6). Together, these results indicate that the PKA/RIM1α pathway is required for CB1 receptor-mediated effects on the release machinery and for long-term, but not short-term, synaptic plasticity.

Given the widespread prevalence of eCB-dependent LTD, we tested whether the RIM1α-dependent mechanism of long-term plasticity is conserved in other brain structures. In the BLA, where eCBs also mediate a form of I-LTD (Azad et al., 2004; Marsicano et al., 2002), we first investigated whether CB1 receptors could suppress GABA release by targeting the release machinery. Indeed, activation of CB1 receptors by WIN decreased mIPSC

results show that RIM1α is necessary for the long-term reduction of GABA release induced by CB1 receptors not only in the hippocampus, but also in the amygdala, and that in both of these structures, the CB1 receptor-mediated effect on release machinery requires PKA.

## DISCUSSION

In this study we investigated the mechanism by which activation of CB1 receptors triggers a long-lasting reduction of transmitter release. First, we report in the hippocampus that eCB-LTD, but not short-term depression, of inhibitory transmission requires cAMP/PKA signaling. Second, we identify the active zone protein RIM1α as a critical player in CB1 receptor-mediated suppression of GABA release. Finally, we show that RIM1α is necessary for eCB-dependent LTD in both the hippocampus and amygdala. Our findings support the notion that enduring changes in the release machinery via cAMP/PKA signaling and RIM1α represent a general mechanism underlying presynaptic forms of long-term plasticity.

### CB1 Receptors Engage Different Pathways during Short- and Long-Term eCB-Plasticity

One of the main conclusions of our study is that the signaling pathways downstream of the CB1 receptor that trigger short- and long-term plasticity differ (Figure 8). The mechanism underlying transient suppression of transmitter release by eCBs, i.e., DSI/DSE, has been extensively studied in several brain areas (reviewed in Alger, 2002; Chevaleyre et al., 2006; Diana and Marty, 2004; Freund et al., 2003; Kreitzer and Regehr, 2002; and Wilson and Nicoll, 2002). Most experimental evidence indicates that eCB-mediated short-term plasticity, at least in the hippocampus and cerebellum, is mainly due to a CB1 receptor-mediated reduction of presynaptic Ca²⁺ influx through VGCCs. Indeed, at climbing fiber inputs to Purkinje cells, action potential-induced Ca²⁺ influx into presynaptic terminals was directly visualized and decreased during DSE to an extent that fully accounted for the decrease in EPSC amplitude (Kreitzer and Regehr, 2001). In the hippocampus, inhibition of presynaptic N-type VGCCs reportedly mediates DSI, and this inhibition likely occurs as a result of the direct action of the Gβ/γ subunits (Wilson et al., 2001). In support of this mechanism, early studies in expression systems showed that Gβ/γ subunits, but not the Ga subunit, are responsible for the modulation of N-type VGCCs (Herlitze et al., 1996; Ikeda, 1996), and that cannabinoids inhibit N-type VGCC (Mackie and Hille, 1992). In addition, the fast onset of DSI (~1 s) (Heinbockel et al., 2005; Wilson et al., 2001) is more consistent with a fast, membrane-delimited pathway of presynaptic inhibition than a phosphorylation-induced change in channel activity, which typically requires many seconds and may involve soluble second messengers (Dolphin, 2003; Hescheler and Schultz, 1993; Hille, 1992). Consistent with this idea, DSI was found to be unaffected by broad spectrum blockers of protein kinases and phosphatases (Wilson

frequency in BLA neurons in 5 mM Ca²⁺, an effect blocked by CB1 receptor antagonists (Figure 7A). WIN induced no significant effect on mIPSC amplitude (data not shown), indicating a presynaptic action of CB1 receptors. Importantly, H89 blocked the WIN-mediated effect on mIPSC frequency (Figure 7B). These results strongly suggest that at BLA inhibitory synapses, CB1 receptors target the release machinery via PKA to depress GABA release.

The coupling of CB1 receptors to GABA release in BLA parallels our findings in hippocampus and suggests that CB1 receptor-mediated plasticity in these two structures may share important features. We first verified that low-frequency stimulation (LFS, 100 stimuli, 1 Hz) within the amygdala, close to the external capsule, triggers a CB1 receptor-dependent LTD of IPSCs in the BLA (data not shown) (Azad et al., 2004; Marsicano et al., 2002). As in the hippocampus (Figure 3A), BLA I-LTD was abolished in RIM1α KO mice (Figure 7C; –1.7% ± 6.3%, n = 11 cells, 5 KO mice, versus 25.3% ± 2.4%, n = 9 cells, 6 WT mice, p < 0.0016). In addition, to rule out a potential decrease in glutamate release during I-LTD induction in KO mice, we tested whether direct activation of mGluR-I with an agonist could trigger I-LTD in these mice. Similar to the results observed with LFS, we found that DHPG-evoked LTD was also abolished in RIM1α KO mice (Figure 7D, 27.6% ± 8.0%, n = 7, 3 WT mice, versus 3.4% ± 4.0%, n = 6, 4 KO mice, p = 0.02). Interestingly, as observed in the hippocampus (Figure 4A), the IPSC depression during DHPG application was identical in both WT and RIM1α KO mice, indicating that the acute effect of CB1 receptor activation on GABA release (Azad et al., 2004) is also independent of RIM1α in the amygdala. In conclusion, our re-

et al., 2001) and by manipulation of the cAMP pathway (Morishita et al., 1998; Wilson et al., 2001). Our study confirms these observations, thereby supporting the notion that DSI is unlikely to be mediated by adenylyl cyclase inhibition. Furthermore, we demonstrate that both cAMP/PKA signaling and RIM1α are necessary for I-LTD, but not DSI.

Previous studies at both inhibitory (Chevaleyre and Castillo, 2003) and excitatory (Ronesi et al., 2004) synapses have shown that the induction of eCB-mediated LTD requires CB1 receptor activation for several minutes, and that once this form of plasticity is induced, it becomes independent of CB1 receptor activation. The relatively long induction period suggests that CB1 receptors may engage a different signaling process than the one mediating transient suppression of transmitter release. Indeed, the fast time course of DSI (<1 min) likely reflects the transient profile of eCB production and CB1 receptor engagement since CB1 receptor desensitization does not occur within this time window. Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that DSI requires neither cAMP/PKA signaling nor RIM1α because CB1 receptor activation is too brief to significantly engage the αi/o effector limb of the G protein signaling cascade. Our findings are consistent with a model (Figure 8) whereby brief activation of CB1 receptors, presumably by blocking presynaptic VGCCs via Gβ/γ subunits (Wilson et al., 2001), leads to short-term depression of transmitter release. In contrast, a more sustained, but still transient activation of CB1 receptors (Chevaleyre and Castillo, 2003; Ronesi et al., 2004) downregulates the cAMP/PKA signaling pathway (Childers and Deadwyler, 1996; Howlett et al., 1986), perhaps via the Gα subunit, thereby triggering a RIM1α-dependent modification in the release machinery to suppress transmitter release in a long-lasting manner.

**CB1 Receptors Can Control Synaptic Transmission by Targeting the Release Machinery in a PKA- and RIM1α-Dependent Manner**

Most studies have shown that CB1 receptor-mediated suppression of GABA release mainly occurs as a result of presynaptic VGCC modulation (Diana and Marty, 2003; Hajos et al., 2000; Hoffman and Lupica, 2000; Varma et al., 2002; Wilson et al., 2001). Consistent with this mechanism, activation of CB1 receptors depressed the frequency of spontaneous IPSCs (action potential-driven events), but not mIPSC frequency, monitored under normal extracellular Ca²⁺ concentration in the hippocampus (Alger et al., 1996; Hajos et al., 2000; Hoffman and Lupica, 2000; Pitler and Alger, 1994; Varma et al., 2002; Wilson et al., 2001) and the amygdala (Azad et al., 2003; Katona et al., 2001). Taken together, these observations could be interpreted to mean that CB1 receptors do not target the release machinery. In the cerebellum, however,

identity of CB1 receptor targets have been largely unexplored. Our results demonstrate that CB1 receptors can target the release machinery via the cAMP/PKA pathway. Moreover, we provide evidence that both PKA and CB1 receptor action on GABA release depends on the presence of the active zone protein RIM1α.

Previous studies have suggested that CB1 receptor agonists suppress action potential-driven synaptic responses independently of PKA (Azad et al., 2003; Daniel et al., 2004; Huang et al., 2002; Robbe et al., 2001). While these data seem to conflict with our model (Figure 8), agonist application likely engages multiple pathways downstream of CB1 receptors. Any one of these mechanisms could suppress transmitter release to such an extent that a concurrent PKA-dependent change at the level of the release machinery could go undetected. Finally, our findings are consistent with previous reports showing that cAMP/PKA signaling enhances inhibitory synaptic transmission by increasing release probability independently of presynaptic Ca²⁺ influx, not only in the hippocampus (Capogna et al., 1995; Sciancalepore and Cherubini, 1995; Trudeau et al., 1996) but also in the cerebellum (Kondo and Marty, 1997; Llano and Gerschenfeld, 1993; Saitow et al., 2005).

It is likely that PKA-dependent modulation of transmitter release occurs as a result of the phosphorylation of presynaptic proteins involved in exocytosis (for a recent review see Seino and Shibasaki, 2005). RIM1α emerges as a unique candidate, as this presynaptic protein is phosphorylated by PKA and its phosphorylation reportedly enhances glutamate release in cerebellum (Lonart et al., 2003). RIM1α has been exclusively localized to presynaptic nerve terminals in rodents (Wang et al., 1997) and in C. elegans (Koushika et al., 2001; Weimer et al., 2006). In situ hybridization studies suggest that RIM1α is expressed in all neurons (Schoch et al., 2006). Furthermore, immunohistochemistry evidence in the hippocampus shows that RIM1α is coexpressed with GAD67 (S. Schoch, personal communication), indicating that RIM1α is present in GABAergic interneurons. In this context, it is tempting to speculate that activation of CB1 receptors, presumably by a reduction of PKA activity, may lead to a decrease in RIM1α phosphorylation. However, it is formally possible that some other RIM1α partner, also phosphorylated by PKA, may mediate the CB1 receptor-induced effects on the release machinery.

PKA/RIM1α as a General Mechanism for Presynaptic Plasticity

RIM1α is a key protein in the active zone (Wang et al., 1997) that regulates neurotransmitter release (Calakos et al., 2004; Koushika et al., 2001; Schoch et al., 2002), and it is thought to scaffold and organize the synaptic release machinery (Sudhof, 2004). Its selective localization to active zones and its interactions with multiple presynaptic molecules places RIM1α in a strategic position to modulate presynaptic release and plasticity (Kaeser and Sudhof, 2005). In addition, RIM1α KO mice show

Figure 8. Model of the Divergent Signaling Pathways Downstream of the CB1 Receptor that Trigger eCB-Mediated Short- or Long-Term Depression

During eCB-mediated short-term depression, brief activation of CB1 receptors reversibly depresses neurotransmitter release, mainly by blocking presynaptic VGCC, presumably via Gβ/γ subunits. In contrast, during the induction of eCB-mediated LTD, a longer-lasting (i.e., few minutes) (Chevaleyre and Castillo, 2003; Ronesi et al., 2004) activation of CB1 receptors inhibits adenylyl cyclase (AC) activity via Gα subunits, thereby reducing presynaptic cAMP levels and PKA activity. This modification “gates” an enduring change of the release machinery that requires the active zone protein RIM1α. PKA may directly phosphorylate RIM1α, other associated proteins, or a combination thereof.

it has been reported that CB1 receptors can act downstream of Ca²⁺ influx (Diana and Marty, 2003; Takahashi and Linden, 2000). A recent report demonstrated that the CB1 receptor-mediated effect on miniature synaptic events depends on basal Ca²⁺ in the presynaptic terminal (Yamasaki et al., 2006). A similar observation was also reported in the amygdala (Azad et al., 2003). Thus, in the absence of action potentials—i.e., in the presence of TTX—and in blockers of presynaptic Ca²⁺ influx, quantal release may still depend on basal Ca²⁺ in the terminal (Yamasaki et al., 2006), and it is likely that Ca²⁺ released from intracellular stores plays an important role in this process (Collin et al., 2005). It is therefore conceivable that decreasing presynaptic Ca²⁺, a likely consequence of continuous action potential blockade with TTX, may mask any CB1 receptor-mediated (Ca²⁺-dependent) effect on the release machinery in normal extracellular Ca²⁺.

We now show in the CA1 area of the hippocampus that after blocking action potentials and Ca²⁺ influx through VGCCs, CB1 receptors suppress mIPSC frequency (although in 5 mM extracellular Ca²⁺). Early studies have demonstrated that presynaptic Gi/o protein-coupled receptors can suppress transmitter release downstream of Ca²⁺ influx, presumably by targeting the release machinery (Cohen et al., 1992; Dittman and Regehr, 1996; Gereau and Conn, 1995; Jarolimek and Misgeld, 1997; Poncer et al., 1995; Scanziani et al., 1992, 1995; Scholz and Miller, 1992; Umemiya and Berger, 1995). While a similar mechanism may contribute to the CB1 receptor-mediated suppression of transmitter release at some synapses (Szabo and Schlicker, 2005), the precise signaling pathway and

Endocannabinoid-Mediated I-LTD Requires PKA/RIM1α

significant cognitive deficits (Powell et al., 2004). Previous studies reported that RIM1α is critical for the long-term enhancement of glutamate release associated with PKA-dependent, NMDA receptor-independent presynaptic forms of LTP at excitatory synapses in both the hippocampus (Castillo et al., 2002) and the cerebellum (Castillo et al., 2002; Lonart et al., 2003). More recently, Huang et al. (2005) have described a role for RIM1α in the PKA-dependent late phase of LTP at Schaffer collateral to CA1 pyramidal cell synapses. It is worth noting that all these studies identified a role for RIM1α exclusively in excitatory LTP. We now demonstrate that CB1 receptor-dependent LTD at inhibitory synapses requires RIM1α. In addition, we show that cAMP/PKA signaling is necessary for hippocampal I-LTD. Enduring changes in the release machinery mediated by PKA signaling and RIM1α represent a widespread mechanism underlying presynaptic regulation of long-term plasticity (LTP and LTD) at both excitatory and inhibitory synapses.

### I-LTD as a Substrate for Learning and Memory

Disrupting eCB-CB1 receptor signaling has a variety of effects on both hippocampus- and amygdala-dependent memory tasks (Chhatwal et al., 2005; Kamprath et al., 2006; Marsicano et al., 2002; Mikics et al., 2006; Suzuki et al., 2004; Varvel et al., 2005, 2006; Varvel and Lichtman, 2002). However, the precise role of this pathway, let alone I-LTD, in learning and memory still remains to be fully understood. Unlike manipulations involving the CB1 receptor, RIM1α KO maintain short-term eCB-mediated plasticity (DSI) without the long-term form (I-LTD). These mice have striking deficits in acquiring both hippocampus- and amygdala-dependent memories (Powell et al., 2004). I-LTD strongly modulates excitability and induction of LTP in both brain areas (Azad et al., 2004; Chevaleyre and Castillo, 2004), so it is possible that this process, together with other deficits in synaptic function (Huang et al., 2005; Kaeser and Sudhof, 2005), could contribute to the RIM1α KO phenotype. Selective disruption of the RIM1α pathway in a subset of synaptic inputs (e.g., those expressing CB1 receptors) may help to establish the contribution of eCB-mediated long-term plasticity to learning and memory.

### EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES

Experiments were performed in C57Bl/6 mice (3–6 weeks; Charles River), paired RIM1α KO and WT mouse littermates (3–6 weeks), or Wistar rats (3–5 weeks; Charles River). RIM1α KO mice were generated as described previously (Schoch et al., 2002). Transverse hippocampal slices were prepared as described elsewhere (Chevaleyre and Castillo, 2003). Animals were killed by decapitation in accordance with institutional regulations. Slices (400 μm thickness) were cut on a vibrating slicer (Dosaka, Kyoto, Japan) in ice-cold extracellular solution containing 215 mM sucrose, 2.5 mM KCl, 20 mM glucose, 26 mM NaHCO₃, 1.6 mM NaH₂PO₄, 1 mM CaCl₂, 4 mM MgSO₄, and 4 mM MgCl₂. The cutting medium was gradually switched to the recording solution (ACSF) that contained 124 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 10 mM glucose, 26 mM NaHCO₃, 1 mM NaH₂PO₄, 2.5 mM CaCl₂, and 1.3 mM MgSO₄. Slices were kept at room temperature for at least 1.5 hr before recording. Cutting and recording solutions were saturated with 95% O₂ and 5% CO₂ (pH 7.4). Experiments were performed at 25.0°C ± 0.1°C except for mIPSC recordings (28.0°C).

CA1 pyramidal cells were blind-patched and recorded in whole-cell voltage-clamp mode. For recording IPSCs, hippocampal slices were completely submerged and continuously superfused at a flow rate of 2 ml/min with ACSF containing NMDA and AMPA/Kainate receptor antagonists (25 μM d-APV and 10 μM NBQX). Constant-voltage synaptic stimulation (200 μs pulse width) was delivered in pairs (100 ms interstimulus interval) via a patch-type pipette filled with ACSF and placed in the middle third of S. radiatum. For experiments with bulk stimulation, stimulation pipette tips were broken to ~20 μm and IPSCs were recorded at –60 mV for DSI or +10 mV for I-LTD with an internal solution containing 123 mM cesium gluconate, 1 mM CaCl₂, 10 mM EGTA, 10 mM HEPES, 10 mM glucose, 5 mM ATP, and 0.4 mM GTP (pH 7.2; 280–290 mOsm). We adjusted stimulus intensity to evoke IPSCs of comparable amplitudes across experiments (0.5–1.4 nA). All mIPSCs were recorded with the same internal solution at +20 mV and ACSF containing 500 nM TTX, 100 μM CdCl₂, 5 mM CaCl₂, 25 μM d-APV, and 10 μM NBQX. For focal stimulation experiments, IPSCs were recorded at –60 mV with an internal solution containing CsCl instead of cesium gluconate. The stimulus strength for these experiments was reduced to elicit small-amplitude IPSCs (~30 pA) and a ~10% failure rate over >10 min baseline. Series resistance (Rs, typically 8–15 MΩ) was continuously monitored throughout each experiment with a –5 mV, 80 ms command pulse delivered prior to each stimulus pair; cells with more than 10% change in Rs were excluded from analysis. I-LTD was induced after a stable baseline by TBS consisting of a series of ten bursts of five stimuli (100 Hz within each burst, 200 ms interburst interval, repeated four times, 5 s apart). I-LTD magnitude was quantified by averaging IPSC amplitudes for 10 min periods right before and 20 min after TBS. DSI was evoked by a 5 s voltage step from –60 mV to 0 mV. Typically 2–3 DSIs per cell were averaged prior to group statistical analysis. The peak inhibition during DSI was quantified by averaging IPSC amplitudes 6 and 12 s after depolarization. IPSCs were monitored every 6 s for DSI and every 20 s for I-LTD. Five- to ten-second epochs were obtained every fifteen seconds for mIPSC analysis. Extracellular field recordings were performed using recording pipettes filled with 1M NaCl. For fEPSPs stimulating and recording pipettes were placed in the middle third of CA1 S. radiatum. fIPSP experiments in CA1 were performed under the same recording conditions as whole-cell IPSC experiments, except that stimulation and recording pipette tips were both placed in S. pyramidale ~150 μm apart. Stimulating and recording pipettes were placed at a similar depth within the tissue for each experiment (80–100 μm). Stimulation intensity was adjusted to produce 0.2–0.4 mV fIPSP. In each experiment, we confirmed that these potentials were completely blocked by the GABA-A receptor antagonist picrotoxin (100 μM), in accordance with previously published reports (Lambert et al., 1991; Arai et al., 1995).

For experiments performed in BLA, coronal slices were prepared from 4–8 week old male C57BI/6 mice using similar methods as described above. Principal cells in the BLA were identified by their morphological and electrophysiological characteristics (Washburn and Moises, 1992). IPSCs were recorded from principal cells in the basal nucleus using the same internal solution as for focal stimulation in hippocampus, voltage clamped between –60 mV and –70 mV. Synaptic responses were evoked as paired-pulse stimuli (200 μs pulse width, 50 ms apart) via monopolar ACSF-filled patch-type pipettes with broken tips (~20 μm) placed just medial to the external capsule. I-LTD was triggered with LFS (100 stimuli at 1 Hz, intensity twice that of test pulses). Recording conditions for mIPSCs were identical to those for hippocampus.

Whole-cell and extracellular recordings were performed with a MultiClamp 700A amplifier (Axon Instruments Inc., Union City, CA) whose output signals were filtered at 3 kHz, acquired at 5 kHz, and analyzed on-line using customized software for IgorPro (Wavemetrics Inc., Lake Oswego, OR). Results are reported as mean ± SEM. Error bars

indicate ± SEM in all figures. Statistical analyses were performed using Student’s t test. Unless otherwise stated, drugs were bath applied following dilution into the ACSF from concentrated stock solutions. SR 141716 (NIMH), H89 (Sigma-Aldrich), FSK (Calbiochem), NBQX, AM 251, WIN, and CP 55,940 (Tocris) were dissolved in DMSO. d-APV, DHPG (Tocris), PKI 14-22 amide (cell permeable, myristoylated) and PKA inhibitor 6-22 amide (Calbiochem) were dissolved in water. For experiments involving drug treatment of slices, interleaved controls were performed in the same concentration of the respective solvent. Stock solutions of drugs were stored at –20°C prior to use. RIM1α KO and WT littermates were shipped to Albert Einstein College of Medicine (Bronx, NY) unidentified, and data were acquired and analyzed in a blind fashion; the KO mice exhibit no obvious phenotype ([Schoch et al., 2002](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0896-6273(02)00670-8)). Genotype was confirmed afterward by PCR using tail DNA.
