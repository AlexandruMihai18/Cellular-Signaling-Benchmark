## Abstract  
Aldosterone, secreted by adrenal glomerulosa cells, allows the adaptation of the vertebrate organism to a wide range of physiological and pathological stimuli including acute haemodynamic challenges and long-term changes in dietary sodium and potassium intake. Most of the extracellular signals are mediated by cytosolic Ca²⁺ signal deriving from Ca²⁺ release, store-operated and/or voltage-gated Ca²⁺ influx. Mitochondria in glomerulosa cells play a fundamental role in generating and modulating the final biological response. These organelles not only house several enzymes of aldosterone biosynthesis but also—in a Ca²⁺-dependent manner—provide NADPH for the function of these enzymes. Moreover, mitochondria, constituting a high portion of cytoplasmic volume and displaying a uniquely low-threshold Ca²⁺ sequestering ability, shape and thus modulate the decoding of the complex cytosolic Ca²⁺ response. The unusual features of mitochondrial Ca²⁺ signalling that permit such an integrative function in adrenal glomerulosa cells are hereby described.

## Control of aldosterone secretion  

The steroid hormone aldosterone, secreted by the glomerulosa cells of the adrenal cortex, plays a central role in the control of saltwater balance. Its major site of action is the kidney, but it also modifies the transport processes in the epithelial cells of the colon, excretory glands, etc. In its main target, the distal nephron, aldosterone enhances Na⁺ reabsorption as well as K⁺ and H⁺ secretion. By these actions, aldosterone controls the volume of extracellular fluid, modifies the function of excitable cells and also the acid-base homeostasis of the organism. There is a great variety of situations in which aldosterone secretion is increased. Hormone secretion depends on dietary Na⁺ and K⁺ intake; reduced Na⁺ or increased K⁺ consumption induces hypersecretion which may be sustained as long as the diet is not corrected. Acute fluid loss such as bleeding, intense perspiration and diarrhoea or haemodynamic challenges associated with postural changes (standing up from supine position) are effective stimuli of hormone secretion which may increase within minutes. During physical exercise, both perspiration-evoked fluid loss and the moderate hyperkalaemia stimulate hormone secretion by glomerulosa cells.

Although a great variety of physiological or pathological situations alter aldosterone secretion; in fact, almost all of these stimuli converge on two factors that directly activate hormone production in glomerulosa cells, namely angiotensin II and extracellular [K⁺]. Under stress conditions, the pituitary hormone ACTH (acting via cAMP) may also amplify the secretion, but this effect is transient. Angiotensin II or hyperkalaemia is responsible for hyperaldosteronism that is a characteristic symptom or even an accessory pathogenic factor in several diseases. Changes in haemodynamics (e.g. in heart failure) and/or hypoproteinaemia-evoked redistribution of fluid spaces (in hepatic cirrhosis associated
with ascites) activate the renin–angiotensin system and thus cause hypersecretion of aldosterone. Hyperaldosteronism in tissue damage (e.g. burning) and renal insufficiency is due to the associating hyperkalaemia.

The second messenger mediating the effect of angiotensin II and K⁺ is Ca²⁺ albeit both stimuli can also activate additional signalling pathways [72]. The specialities of Ca²⁺ signalling render glomerulosa cells capable of producing rapid and powerful but transient responses, as well as gradually developing long-term responses.

Physiological hypersecretion of aldosterone which is sustained for weeks or months may occur during long-term dietary potassium loading. Potassium loading decreases rather than increases the secretion of renin. However, extracellular K⁺ acts directly on glomerulosa cells. High basal activity of the plasmalemmal Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase [29] and the presence of inwardly rectifying K⁺ channels, identified as TASK channels in glomerulosa cells [16, 17], establish a resting membrane potential slightly more positive than −80 mV [61]. Activation of T-type voltage-operated Ca²⁺ channels can be revealed at a uniquely negative threshold value, at ∼−71 mV [80]. Based on Nernst's equation, an increase of [K⁺] by 1 mM may already activate these channels. In harmony with the electrophysiological characteristics of glomerulosa cells, the elevation of plasma [K⁺] by a few tenths of millimolars is an effective stimulus of aldosterone secretion in man [1, 20], in the dog [1] and in the rat [7]. Under well-defined in vitro conditions, aldosterone production is enhanced when extracellular [K⁺] is raised by 1 mM or even less [59, 80]. Although the Ca²⁺ influx-evoked cytosolic Ca²⁺ response does not attain 200 nM [80], it is capable of activating hormone secretion [59] and, importantly, mitochondrial metabolism. Cytosolic Ca²⁺ signal is transferred into the mitochondrial matrix [73], and the ensuing mitochondrial Ca²⁺ signal—through the activation of intramitochondrial dehydrogenases [44]—increases the level of reduced pyridine nucleotides (NAD(P)H) [59, 65]. NADPH, a cofactor of aldosterone biosynthesis, is formed by NADP⁺-linked isocitrate dehydrogenase or by transhydrogenation from NADH [67, 81]. The Ca²⁺-dependent activation of mitochondrial metabolism, hence the formation of NAD(P) H, plays a significant role in the enhancement of aldosterone secretion [71].

Low submicromolar Ca²⁺ signals are transferred into the mitochondrial matrix

Mitochondrial Ca²⁺ signals are formed by the transfer of the primary cytosolic Ca²⁺ signal into the mitochondrial matrix. The key element of mitochondrial Ca²⁺ uptake is the Ruthenium Red-sensitive mitochondrial Ca²⁺ uniporter (MCU) [2, 18], located in the inner mitochondrial membrane. An EF-hand containing transmembrane protein, MICU1 has been assumed to mediate the effect of cytosolic Ca²⁺ on the function of the MCU [55]. The driving force of the transport is the ~180-mV membrane potential (matrix side negative). In mitochondrial suspensions, micromolar [Ca²⁺] was required to detect net Ca²⁺ transport, and half-maximal transport rate was found at [Ca²⁺] between 10⁻⁵ and 10⁻⁴ M [28]. In electrophysiological studies on mitochondria (mitochondria without intact outer membrane), MCU was identified as an inwardly rectifying Ca²⁺ selective channel. The current could be measured when [Ca²⁺] exceeded 20 μM [37]. In another study, two related currents were observed when millimolar concentrations of Ca²⁺ were applied [46]. The apparent contradiction between the low Ca²⁺ affinity of the uniporter and the efficiency of submicromolar or slightly higher cytosolic Ca²⁺ signals to evoke mitochondrial Ca²⁺ signal was first explained by indirect [14, 62] and, more recently, by direct demonstration [15, 27] of high-Ca²⁺ microdomains formed between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (more precisely, the orifice of IP₃ receptors (IP3Rs)) and apposing mitochondria. Mitochondrial Ca²⁺ uptake from high-Ca²⁺ microdomains may also occur during voltage-operated or store-operated Ca²⁺ influx [43, 47, 54] when such microdomains are formed between the orifice of Ca²⁺ channels and nearby mitochondria. Nevertheless, no such microdomains can account for the accumulation of Ca²⁺ by mitochondria during store-operated Ca²⁺ influx either in COS-7 [39] or in HeLa cells [27]. Similarly, in rat glomerulosa cells, store-operated Ca²⁺ influx evokes an increase in mitochondrial NAD(P)H (a response requiring mitochondrial Ca²⁺ uptake) [66] although the slowly developing cytosolic Ca²⁺ signal that does not attain 200 nM [64] is unfavourable for the formation of high-Ca²⁺ microdomains.

In the aldosterone-producing H295R adrenocortical cells stimulated with angiotensin II, mitochondrial Ca²⁺ uptake is significantly faster in the vicinity of the ER (i.e. where high-Ca²⁺ microdomains are formed) than far from ER vesicles [70, 74]. On the other hand, Ca²⁺ ions entering through voltage-operated channels are comparably sequestered by subplasmalemmal and perinuclear mitochondria (near and far, resp., from the orifice of the plasmalemmal channels) implying that in adrenocortical cells, the formation of high-Ca²⁺ perimitochondrial microdomains is not a sine qua non for mitochondrial Ca²⁺ uptake [76]. These observations indicate that, at least in glomerulosa and the related H295R cells, the formation of high-Ca²⁺ microdomains is not essential for the transfer of cytosolic Ca²⁺ signal into the mitochondrial matrix, suggesting that mitochondria can sequester Ca²⁺ also at low submicromolar cytosolic [Ca²⁺] ([Ca²⁺]c).

Data on the Ca²⁺ affinity of the mitochondrial transport system are conflicting as exemplified with HeLa cells:
threshold values of 200 nM [12] and >2 μM [48] were alike published. Since the discordant results may reflect different experimental conditions, we compared the threshold of mitochondrial Ca²⁺ uptake of various cell types applying identical experimental protocol. In order to exclude the effect of extramitochondrial factors, the cells were examined after permeabilization with digitonin, under identical incubation conditions. Elevation of [Mg²⁺] even within the physiological range significantly inhibits mitochondrial Ca²⁺ uptake [77]; therefore, free Mg²⁺ concentration was kept at 0.5 mM. The cells were superfused with a cytosol-like medium containing mitochondrial substrates and 100 nM Ca²⁺. Under such conditions, net mitochondrial Ca²⁺ uptake could be observed in glomerulosa cells when extracellular [Ca²⁺] was raised to 250 nM, in H295R adrenocortical cells at [Ca²⁺] <0.5 μM and in HeLa cells at 1 μM [76] (Fig. 1). It should be

Fig. 1 Threshold of mitochondrial Ca²⁺ uptake in different cell types. Permeabilized rat glomerulosa cells, H295R cells and HeLa cells, preloaded with Rhod-2, were exposed to stepwise increases of [Ca²⁺] in the cytosol-like superfusion medium. Changes in [Ca²⁺]c are indicated by the black horizontal lines. Fluorescence intensity was monitored with a PTI microfluorimeter as described [38]

emphasized that raising [Ca²⁺] in the cytosol-like medium from the basal 60 to a mere 140 nM already results in net mitochondrial Ca²⁺ uptake not only in glomerulosa but also in INS-1 insulin-producing cells [58]. (The concomitant mitochondrial NAD(P)H signal in glomerulosa cells provides evidence for the biological significance of such small Ca²⁺ signals.) This uniquely low threshold of mitochondrial Ca²⁺ uptake may provide the ability of these cell types to secrete hormone in response to physiologically relevant small, often tonic stimuli as required during moderate hyperkalaemia and hyperglycaemia, respectively.

Which mechanism may perform the transport of Ca²⁺ into the mitochondria when [Ca²⁺]c is in the low submicromolar range? Such a function of MCU is hardly compatible with its low Ca²⁺ affinity. The mitochondrial Na⁺/Ca²⁺ antiporter is electrogenic and therefore may cause Ca²⁺ sequestration only if the mitochondria are depolarized. This is not the case in the above-described examples. Ca²⁺ influx from low-Ca²⁺ cytosol has recently been attributed to Letm1 [82], an IMM protein displaying a K⁺/H⁺ [52] and/or Ca²⁺/H⁺ exchanger activity [35]. Considering that this protein is required also for the biogenesis of the respiratory chain (translation of Cox1 and cytochrome b) [40], the role of Letm1 in the control of mitochondrial Ca²⁺ uptake as well as the identification of the factor responsible for the low-threshold Ca²⁺ uptake requires further studies.

## Mitochondrial function and cytosolic Ca²⁺ oscillation

Oscillatory Ca²⁺ signalling is a ubiquitous phenomenon and allows digital decoding of the stimulus intensity [3, 56]. The significance of frequency coding has been revealed in several processes including the control of liver metabolism, smooth muscle contractility and gene transcription [5]. In addition to temporal kinetics, the spatial profile of the Ca²⁺ signal may also encode biological information [5, 19]).

The oscillatory character of cytosolic Ca²⁺ signalling may be brought about by several mechanisms. In excitable cells, the oscillation may depend on oscillatory Ca²⁺ release through ryanodine receptors from the ER [11]. In non-excitable cells, Ca²⁺ oscillation is generated by sequential regenerative discharges of stored calcium for which most often (but not always) the bell-shaped Ca²⁺ dependency of IP3Rs [4, 6, 25, 33] is the basic mechanism. This biphasic Ca²⁺ sensitivity of IP3R allows oscillatory Ca²⁺ release even in the case of constant IP₃ concentration [31, 87]. IP₃ receptors have three isoforms that differ both in IP₃ affinity and Ca²⁺ dependence. Literary data on the significance of the single IP3Rs in inducing Ca²⁺ oscillation are conflicting. Nevertheless, the bulk of evidence shows that both IP3R1 and IP3R2 contribute to the generation of Ca²⁺ oscillations,

whereas IP3R3 is an anti-oscillatory unit [32, 79, 85]. In rat glomerulosa cells, out of the three isoforms, the expression of IP3R1 mRNA attains some 80% of total IP3R mRNA whereas that of IP3R3 mRNA is only 2–4% of total [23]. The Ca²⁺ dependence of IP3R1 is biphasic, small increases in \[Ca²⁺\]c enhance, while larger but still submicromolar elevations of \[Ca²⁺\]c reduce the efficiency of IP₃ to release Ca²⁺ from the endoplasmic reticulum [25, 78]. Since the biphasic Ca²⁺ dependence of IP3Rs is a principal factor in the generation of cytosolic Ca²⁺ oscillations, the dominant expression of IP3R1 probably favours the development of oscillatory Ca²⁺ responses.

The kinetics of oscillation may be modified by the effect of Ca²⁺ on IP₃ formation and metabolism and the function of plasmalemmal Ca²⁺ channels (reviewed in [22]) as well as by the biphasic effect of Ca²⁺ on the binding of IP₃ to its receptor [68, 69]. The rate of free radical formation may also modify the oscillation [9]. (Reactive oxygen derivatives may even induce Ca²⁺ oscillations per se [86].) In addition to these factors, mitochondria, by their Ca²⁺-buffering action [45] and ATP formation [83], may exert a striking effect on the generation of cytosolic Ca²⁺ signalling.

IP₃-evoked oscillatory cytosolic Ca²⁺ signals are transferred into the mitochondrial matrix, and there, the oscillatory pattern is preserved. This phenomenon was first described in rat glomerulosa cells [60] and later observed in several other cell types (e.g. [21, 30, 42]). (Confluent mitochondrial signals associating high-frequency cytosolic oscillations, usually observed after the application of supraphysiological stimuli [60], are accounted for by the low capacity of the mitochondrial Ca²⁺ extrusion systems.) Glomerulosa cells display a very high density of mitochondria; these organelles constitute 25–30% of cytoplasmic volume [53]. Human, glomerulosa-like H295R cells are also mitochondrion-rich; the organelles typically appear as a perinuclear belt leaving the subplasmalemmal area poor of mitochondria (Fig. 2). Mitochondria function as immobile buffer through the accumulation of Ca²⁺ during the rising phase of cytosolic Ca²⁺ spikes and the release of Ca²⁺ during their decaying phase. Buffers always attenuate the oscillatory changes in the concentration of their ligand. The efficient buffering of cytosolic Ca²⁺ signals in the angiotensin II-stimulated H295R cells is clearly shown by the observation that Ca²⁺ spikes in the mitochondrion-poor subplasmalemmal region are twice as big as the spikes recorded in the mitochondrion-rich perinuclear region [76] (Fig. 3). This kind of spatial pattern may also fine-tune cell function.

Despite the fact that glomerulosa cells predominantly express the pro-oscillatory IP3R isoform (IP3R1), the efficient Ca²⁺ buffering by the mitochondria may be the reason why stimulation of glomerulosa or H295R cells with low concentration of angiotensin II evokes only low-frequency,

rather sluggish cytosolic (and mitochondrial) Ca²⁺ oscillation [65, 73] (Fig. 3). After the dissipation of their (inside highly negative) membrane potential, mitochondria obviously buffer Ca²⁺ with lower efficacy; therefore, Ca²⁺ peaks in the mitochondrion-poor subplasmalemmal and mitochondrion-rich perinuclear cytosolic domains become more similar. The duration of the spikes becomes much shorter, the interspike periods become more regular and the amplitude of the single spikes in the mitochondrion-rich perinuclear area gets amplified [76] (Fig. 3). It is probable that after mitochondrial depolarisation, the IP₃-induced \[Ca²⁺\]c rise in the vicinity of IP3Rs is quicker to attain levels which are capable of inhibiting further Ca²⁺ release from the ER. Due to the lack of Ca²⁺ efflux during the decay of the cytosolic Ca²⁺ signal, the negative feedback of Ca²⁺ on IP3Rs may terminate faster, and hence the regenerative Ca²⁺ release from the ER [34] may begin earlier. Thus, the oscillation-promoting potential

#### Generation of sustained mitochondrial \(\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\) and NAD(P)H signal

As emphasized above, glomerulosa cells produce both phasic and tonic secretory responses. If increased mitochondrial \(\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\) uptake is essential in the induction of aldosterone hypersecretion, mitochondria may be expected to generate sustained \(\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\) and NAD(P)H signals. However, the parallelism of the cytosolic and mitochondrial signals is not mandatory. In HeLa cells, when high-amplitude cytosolic \(\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\) oscillation of short duration was induced with histamine, the ensuing high mitochondrial \(\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\) signal exhibited an immediate fall and rapid decay back to resting level [12]. The decay of the signal may be due to desensitisation of the mitochondrial \(\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\) transport system, described, e.g., in pancreatic beta cells [41], in myotubes [11], in RBL-1 cells [49] and in HeLa cells [12, 57]. In hepatocytes, cytosolic \(\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\) oscillation is reliably transferred into the mitochondrial matrix, but sustained elevation of \([\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_{\mathrm{c}}\) evokes only transient increase in \([\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_{\mathrm{m}}\) and mitochondrial NAD(P)H [30, 63]. A similar phenomenon has been observed in \(\mathrm{K}^{+}\)-stimulated MIN6 pancreatic beta-cell line [51].

In glomerulosa cells, oscillatory cytosolic \(\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\) signals, induced by the \(\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\)-mobilizing agonist angiotensin II or vasopressin [60, 65], evoke mitochondrial signal of a pattern identical with that of the oscillatory cytosolic signal. On the other hand, stimulation with \(\mathrm{K}^{+}\)evokes sustained cytosolic as well as sustained mitochondrial signals. If \([\mathrm{K}^{+}]\)is raised from the physiological resting level of \(3.6 \, \mathrm{mM}\) to \(5.6\) or

of IP3Rs is modulated by mitochondrial \(\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\) buffering around the channel orifice.

Whereas cessation of mitochondrial \(\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\) buffering may account for the enhancement of \(\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\) oscillation in adrenocortical cells, the following factors should also be recalled.
(1) \(\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\) exerts a feedback effect on both \(\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\) channels and \(\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\) pumps;
(2) the function of ion pumps requires ATP, and in cell types where ATP formation critically depends on oxidative phosphorylation, the ATP depletion will prevent the reuptake of \(\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\) into the ER, leading to the cessation of its regenerative discharges through IP3Rs;
(3) ATP-dependent phosphorylation also modifies the activity of these transport systems (including that of the IP3Rs). The outcome of these effects depends on the significance of mitochondria in ATP formation as well as the specific isoform of the channels and transporter molecules expressed in a given cell. The combination of these various effects usually leads to a situation different from that seen in glomerulosa cells. In several cell types, including HeLa cells [12, 34], gonadotrophs [36], pancreatic acinar cells [10, 75] or bone marrow stromal cells [24], depolarisation of mitochondria is followed by reduced frequency or abolition of cytosolic \(\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\) oscillation.

### Figure 4
Special features of mitochondrial \(\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\) signalling in glomerulosa and H295R cells. \(ER\) endoplasmic reticulum, \(M\) mitochondrion. The left-hand mitochondrion shows that mitochondrial \(\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\) uptake occurs from a high-\(\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\) microdomain formed between the IP3-activated IP3R and the apposing mitochondrion and from the perimitochondrial cytosol containing \(\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\) at submicromolar concentration. The pattern of cytosolic \(\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\) signal is preserved within the mitochondrial matrix as shown in the right-hand mitochondrion. Aldosterone synthesis is stimulated via cholesterol uptake activated by cytosolic \(\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\) and NADPH formation activated by mitochondrial matrix \(\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\), as shown in the lower mitochondrion.

8.4 mM for 1 min, the mitochondrial (Ca²⁺-dependent) NAD(P)H response lasts for 3–4 min, whereas the effect of a 400-s stimulation with 8.4 mM K⁺ is sustained longer than 20 min [59, 65]. When the cells are stimulated with supraphysiological concentration (2.5 nM) of angiotensin II, the elevation of both [Ca²⁺]c and [Ca²⁺]m is sustained during the observed 10-min period [65]. Similarly to rats, exposure of bovine glomerulosa cells to 10 nM angiotensin II or 13 mM K⁺ induces sustained cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca²⁺ signal [8]. The data obtained in glomerulosa studies are therefore at striking variance with data obtained in hepatocytes and HeLa cells.

The ability of sustaining the mitochondrial signal in glomerulosa cells may be accounted for by the lack or slow development of the desensitisation of the Ca²⁺ uptake mechanism (see above). Alternatively, if the mitochondrial Na⁺/Ca²⁺ exchanger, present in adrenocortical cells [13, 26], has insufficient activity, the mitochondrial Ca²⁺ signal might last longer. Yet, both explanations are challenged by the observation that (in permeabilized glomerulosa cells) Ruthenium Red abolishes the sustained Ca²⁺ signal and evokes an abrupt fall of [Ca²⁺]m [65]. (Moreover, no desensitisation of the mitochondrial Ca²⁺ uptake machinery in H295R cells could be detected when the protocol applied was similar to that which revealed substantial desensitisation in RBL cells [50]; A. Spät and G. Szanda, unpublished.). It is worthwhile to recall that also in primary pancreatic β-cells, the mitochondrial Ca²⁺ signal persists as long as elevated extracellular glucose concentration sustains cytosolic Ca²⁺ signalling [60]. The sustenance of mitochondrial Ca²⁺ signal during non-oscillating cytosolic signal in the two endocrine cell types seems to be a common characteristic. It should be recalled that both glomerulosa and pancreatic β cells have to produce tonic secretory response to long-lasting stimulation with physiological agonists. Therefore, this further analogy between the function of glomerulosa and β cells is not surprising.

### Conclusions

Ca²⁺ signalling in aldosterone-producing adrenal glomerulosa (and in glomerulosa-like H295R) cells displays some unconventional features. The high Ca²⁺ affinity of the mitochondrial Ca²⁺ uptake machinery, the exceptional sensitivity of intramitochondrial metabolism for low submicromolar Ca²⁺ signals, the striking effect of mitochondrial Ca²⁺ buffering on the spatial and temporal pattern of the cytosolic Ca²⁺ signal as well as the presence of both high-Ca²⁺ microdomain dependent and independent mitochondrial Ca²⁺ uptake (summarized in Fig. 4) are rather unusual phenomena in vertebrate cells. However, in the light of the diversity of situations, glomerulosa cells need to respond to (i.e. all combinations of transient or tonic, mild or robust stimuli), these uncommon

Ca²⁺ signalling characteristics may facilitate the adaptive adjustment of hormone secretion.
