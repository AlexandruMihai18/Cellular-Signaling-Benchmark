## ABSTRACT

We present a snapshot of developments in epithelial biology that may prove helpful in understanding cellular aspects of the machinery designed for the synthesis of thyroid hormones on the thyroglobulin precursor. The functional unit of the thyroid gland is the follicle, delimited by a monolayer of thyrocytes. Like the cells of most simple epithelia, thyrocytes exhibit specialization of the cell surface that confronts two different extracellular environments—apical and basolateral, which are separated by tight junctions. Specifically, the basolateral domain faces the interstitium/bloodstream, while the apical domain is in contact with the lumen that is the primary target for newly synthesized thyroglobulin secretion and also serves as a storage depot for previously secreted protein. Thyrocytes use their polarity in several important ways, such as for maintaining basolaterally located iodide uptake and T₄ deiodination, as well as apically located iodide efflux and iodination machinery. The mechanisms by which this organization is established, fall in large part under the more general cell biological problem of intracellular sorting and trafficking of different proteins en route to the cell surface. Nearly all exportable proteins begin their biological life after synthesis in an intracellular compartment known as the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), upon which different degrees of difficulty may be encountered during nascent polypeptide folding and initial export to the Golgi complex. In these initial stages, ER molecular chaperones can assist in monitoring protein folding and export while themselves remaining as resident proteins of the thyroid ER. After export from the ER, most subsequent sorting for protein delivery to apical or basolateral surfaces of thyrocytes occurs within another specialized intracellular compartment known as the trans-Golgi network. Targeting information encoded in secretory proteins and plasma membrane proteins can be exposed or buried at different stages along the export pathway, which is likely to account for sorting and specific delivery of different newly-synthesized proteins. Defects in either burying or exposing these structural signals, and consequent abnormalities in protein transport, may contribute to different thyroid pathologies.

## INTRODUCTION

IN ALL EUKARYOTIC CELLS, specific metabolic functions are compartmentalized to distinct organelles. Cellular diversity is achieved largely by tissue-specific gene expression that controls both intraorganellar protein composition as well as the number of each kind of organelle in a given cell type. The biosynthetic apparatus plays a major role in generating and maintaining the differentiated phenotype, by regulating delivery of new proteins to and from specific organelles, a process commonly referred to as protein targeting, or trafficking (1). Knowledge of protein targeting is crucial to understanding a number of genetic diseases such as cystic fibrosis (2–4), lysosomal (5,6), peroxisomal (7), digestive (8,9), and polycystic diseases (10), as well as understanding animal models of these illnesses (11,12)—but in the years to come, it will probably be even more common to find disturbances of protein targeting reported as part of acquired/maturity-onset diatheses such as type II diabetes (13), infectious and inflammatory states (14–17), and cancer (18). Since protein targeting to the cell surface ultimately depends both on signals contained in the primary, secondary, and tertiary structures of proteins, and cellular machinery that “reads” these signals at different steps along the export pathway, defects either in protein structure or cellular machinery can lead to pathological conditions.

For proteins destined for the plasma membrane, the biosynthetic traffic pathway has been suggested to involve specific transport vesicles that shuttle their cargo through a series of intracellular way-stations (19): at each successive station, specific sorting decisions can be made on the basis of transport signals (5,20) and retention signals (21–24). This general scheme is made unique to thyrocytes by the expression of gene products whose trafficking allows for thyroid-specific functions. In this review, proteins of immediate interest include membrane proteins of the basolateral iodide delivery system, the apical iodination system, and two proteins secreted with opposite polarity, thyroglobulin (Tg) and thrombospondin 1 (TSP).

### PROTEIN TRAFFIC FROM THE THYROID ER TO THE GOLGI COMPLEX

#### ER-to-Golgi Transport Vesicles

In thyrocytes as in other cells, newly synthesized plasma membrane proteins and secretory proteins are initially targeted to the ER by a short signal sequence in the nascent polypeptide (25,26). These nascent proteins must enter or cross the ER membrane in a highly unfolded state (27). After folding is accomplished—except for molecules that are permanent residents of the ER itself—newly made proteins are transported by the budding of carrier vesicles destined for the Golgi complex. Forward transport vesicles are identified by the presence of cytoplasmic coat proteins that are recruited to the membrane surface (19)—at present, two such cytoplasmic coat protein complexes, called COP I and COP II coats, have been identified (28). While COP II coated vesicles are clearly involved in forward vesicle traffic from the ER, the precise role of COP I coated vesicles is still controversial (29). Specifically, it is currently uncertain the extent to which different exportable proteins might be sorted between these two different types of vesicles that can bud from the ER (20,30,31).

#### Quality Control of Protein Export from the ER

Permanent resident proteins of the ER are largely prevented from forward trafficking to the plasma membrane because they contain information which retains them in, or retrieves them to, the ER compartment (21,29,32). By contrast, the average length of time that newly synthesized exportable proteins spend in the ER differs for each protein species (33). Why aren’t all highly unfolded, newly synthesized proteins in the ER available to enter vesicles for immediate export? One likely possibility is that resident molecules of the ER perform a “quality control” function, which helps determine whether an exportable protein is ready to leave this compartment (34).

What provides quality control of ER export? Put simply, during folding of nascent secretory proteins, it is essential that putative retention signals are buried. These retention signals are not necessarily specific sequences, but are generally short hydrophobic stretches or patches that normally end up buried in the core of properly folded globular proteins. The exposure of such hydrophobic patches on protein surfaces is almost entirely restricted to two kinds of situations: (a) nascent polypeptide versions of normal proteins that have not yet had a chance to bury these regions, and (b) mutant proteins that exhibit reduced ability to bury the patches. Thus, it seems appropriate to refer to these exposed hydrophobic regions as “unfolded patches,” since their exposure occurs only rarely in properly folded proteins. Exposure of these unfolded patches on the surface of exportable proteins leads either to protein aggregation or to interaction with permanent resident proteins designed to recognize such features (35–37). Among these resident proteins are ER molecular chaperones, a class of molecules that can be functionally defined as preventing other polypeptide-containing structures from proceeding towards unfavorable nonnative conformations or irreversible aggregation (38,39), so that the efficiency of protein folding and assembly may be facilitated (40). However, as a consequence of their noncovalent association with unfolded protein patches, resident ER chaperones also prevent the egress of exportable proteins from the ER (Fig. 1), as is found in congenital goiter with deficient Tg (40).

To execute their role in protein export, chaperones must not only associate with unfolded secretory proteins for a period of time—they must also dissociate during the folding process. Importantly, these quality controllers can proceed through repeated cycles of binding and release to the same or different unfolded polypeptides (41). For some chaperones, the peptide association-release cycle is coupled to ATP binding and hydrolysis (42).

erones should probably not be thought of as catalysts of specific folding or export, since the mere act of their binding to an exportable protein appears to decrease the ability of that particular protein to exit the ER (38,43–48).

**Conformation Maturation Proceeds through Predictable Folding Intermediates**

For each 100 copies of any particular polypeptide synthesized in the ER, most molecules of the cohort proceed through the energetically most favored folding pathway, such that predictable conformational intermediates are produced in series, while smaller fractions of the cohort can enter novel folded/misfolded states in parallel, that may or may not lead to the same final conformation (49–51). Thus, one useful way to understand the roles played by different ER chaperones is to analyze the predominant folding pathway, and then to examine the stages of conformational maturation at which different chaperones are found to interact. In thyrocytes, some progress towards this goal has been made with Tg, described below.

**Tg Folding Intermediates**

For the purpose of understanding folding in the ER, the use of Tg as a model protein would seem challenging, because complexity of the folding pathway for globular proteins is largely proportional to the length of the nascent polypeptide chain. On the other hand, most model proteins typically fold so quickly in vivo that it can be technically difficult to capture folding intermediates (52) unless specific perturbants are used to slow down the folding pathway (53–56). Thus, with 2,750 amino acids per monomer (57), extremely slow folding of newly-synthesized Tg allows a sequential progression of conformational intermediates to be identified during the first hour after synthesis. A summary of these folding intermediates is shown in Figure 2. An essential point emphasized by this schematic is the kinetic overlap of folding intermediates produced from the initial cohort of pulse-labeled Tg molecules.

While it has long been considered possible that protein aggregates might serve as intermediates in the normal folding pathway for nascent secretory proteins (58,59), Tg is

the first nonmutant exportable protein for which such aggregates have actually been observed (60). This aggregation is thought to be a consequence of the transient appearance of newly-synthesized monomers in a highly unfolded conformation; nevertheless, these aggregates continue in the ultimate progression towards more folded forms of Tg in the thyrocyte ER (61).

Classical biochemical studies have left little doubt that most Tg normally progresses from monomers to dimers (62–67). Moreover, it is apparent from recent studies that in normal thyrocytes, most Tg dimerizes while within the ER, and dimerization may even be required (68) as a means to escape ER quality control machinery, thereby allowing Tg export (40). However, it must be emphasized that there are clear examples of newly synthesized protein hormones that, while normally forming dimers or oligomers in the ER, can be exported from this compartment without oligomerization (69–72); thus, the idea that a small fraction of better-folded Tg monomers might be able to leave the ER, cannot be excluded.

**ER Chaperones in Normal Thyrocytes Associate with Exportable Proteins Both Concomitantly and Sequentially**

The two best known chaperones of the ER lumen are members of the highly conserved hsp70 and hsp90 families of heat shock proteins, known as BiP (73,74) and GRP94 (75), respectively. Detailed studies have now established that multiple copies of these chaperones associate with each Tg very early after synthesis of the peptide chain in the ER, and most of the chaperone molecules have dissociated upon completion of early Tg folding (i.e., by the time Tg has achieved the compact monomer conformation) (61). To the best of our current knowledge, GRP94 has similar if not identical kinetics of association with, and dissociation from, newly synthesized Tg (40,101). Thus, concomitant interactions of different chaperones with Tg has been suggested (76,101), although the possibility of sequential binding of different chaperones to newly synthesized secretory proteins has also been proposed (77,78). It must be noted that models of simultaneous vs. sequential chaperone interaction are not mutually exclusive.

By the time the earliest forms of full-length Tg are released free into the ER lumen, they must have already dissociated from chaperone contacts in the ER membrane. With this in mind, initial chaperone interactions with nascent Tg during the immediate posttranslational period have been investigated by addition of low doses of dithiothreitol to living thyrocytes, which decelerates nascent chain folding (54,56,79,80). The reducing agent permeates the cell and organellar membranes, thereby perturbing the oxidizing environment of the ER (81), and causing disulfide bond formation in nascent chains to be delayed until the agent is removed (54). Using this method, it has been shown that calnexin (82), a calcium binding chaperone embedded in the ER membrane (83), associates extensively with Tg that has yet to form proper disulfide bonds, and this interaction precedes that of BiP (84)—these findings have subsequently been substantiated by observations of cotranslational calnexin association during the synthesis of at least one other exportable protein (85).

FIG. 2. Tg maturation involves a series of predictable folding intermediates in the ER. In the process of normal folding, Tg buries retention signals that could be recognized by quality controllers (i.e., ER chaperones). At the earliest stages, Tg monomers are so highly unfolded that they are predisposed to self-aggregation, which is reversible within the ER. Unfolded monomers then progress to more compact monomers, which assemble into homodimers. Kinetic dispersion in the amount of time required to synthesize and fold Tg results in distinct subfractions of newly synthesized Tg found as different folding intermediates at different times during the first hour after a brief metabolic labeling.

There may be significant differences between the folding pathways of different exportable proteins within the ER of the very same cell. With this idea in mind, the folding and assembly of thrombospondin 1 (TSP, discussed further, below) in the thyroid ER has recently been investigated. This thyroid secretory protein, exhibiting a molecular weight of ~500 kDa by nonreducing SDS-PAGE, is a homotrimer held together by interchain disulfide bonds (86). Recent evidence has established that the NH₂-terminal 20% of this modular protein forms a domain (87–89), which is necessary and sufficient for oligomerization (90, 91) and which folds very rapidly. However, while the TSP homotrimer approaches the size of the Tg homodimer, its oligomeric assembly in the thyroid ER is surprisingly rapid, while the dissociation of bound BiP is substantially protracted beyond the assembly period (92). Evidently, both for Tg and TSP, BiP dissociation is coupled to monomer folding, although this may either precede (Tg) or follow (TSP) the process of oligomeric assembly.

### Intracellular Pools of Secretory Protein

As far as we know, protein trafficking through the series of intracellular compartments that comprises the secretory pathway occurs by and large at the same rate in all follicular cells of the gland (93). Because most models for protein trafficking invoke first order kinetics (59), the compartments of the secretory pathway can be envisaged as a set of pools and drains connected in series (Fig. 3). At steady-state, assuming no intracellular degradation, the number of new Tg molecules entering the first pool (the ER) per unit time equals the export rate from the last pool (secretion from the thyrocyte). In this case, the pool sizes of Tg in each of the intracellular compartments are related to the size of the drains, i.e., the export capacity from each compartment. Consequently, the rate-limiting step in the overall pathway is most easily detected as the compartment with the largest pool size, which for Tg, is the ER (Fig. 3). Moreover, upon “opening the faucet,” i.e., increasing the flux of new Tg that enters the ER by treatment with TSH and other hormones that stimulate new Tg synthesis, both the ER and Golgi pools rise—but growth of the ER pool greatly outstrips that of the Golgi pool (94). These data support the view that steps leading up to Golgi arrival are rate-limiting in the overall process of Tg secretion, as reported for certain other proteins (95).

### Physiologic Response to an Increased Pool of Tg in the ER Involves Increased ER Chaperones

Based upon the foregoing considerations, it has been proposed that most of the time spent by exportable proteins in the ER is used to convert the raw primary structure of nascent chains into more mature tertiary and quaternary conformations that will be acceptable for protein transport (59). Thus, the model in Figure 3 provides an excellent opportunity to examine the chaperone response of thyrocytes to the increased rate of entry and accumulation of nascent Tg in the ER. Under these conditions, the steady-state levels of ER chaperones rise significantly in response to this physiological demand (94).

An increase in ER chaperones concomitant with an in-

with a few conservative amino acid substitutions derived from rat Tg) has been constructed from 5 available partial cDNAs (97,98), subcloned into a mammalian expression vector (with a neomycin-resistance cassette), and transfected and selected for stable expression in CHO cells that maintain normal levels of ER chaperones, or CHO cells genetically engineered for independently increased expression (99) of GRP94 or BiP (100,101). As expected in all CHO cell clones, the ER is the overwhelmingly predominant Tg pool, but when normalized to the rate of Tg synthesis, the size of the Tg pool in the ER is disproportionately expanded in CHO cells in which GRP94 or BiP availability is increased. Moreover, the exit of Tg from the ER is retarded in cells with increased expression of either GRP94 or BiP, and there is a markedly increased appearance of chaperone-bound Tg complexes. These data strongly suggest that the binding of either of these two ER chaperones to Tg does NOT accelerate Tg folding or export, but rather, increased chaperone association with Tg causes increased Tg retention and retardation of Tg trafficking through the secretory pathway (100,101). Thus, these findings are consistent with the possibility that upregulation of the levels of ER chaperones is one means by which cells can increase quality control of Tg and other exportable proteins (47,48). Indeed, this forms the basis for physiological regulation described as the “unfolded protein response” (102–106), which is triggered when increased amounts of Tg (94) and other newly synthesized exportable proteins (107,108) flux into the ER.

Tg Export from the ER Is Connected to Thyroid Hormone Synthesis

Because proper Tg conformation is believed to be essential for its intracellular transport, which leads ultimately to thyroid hormonogenesis, it is not difficult to envision pathological situations in which the inability to fold Tg normally can result in deficient thyroid hormone production. It has already been shown that mere failure to undergo N-linked glycosylation causes irreversible aggregation of Tg in the ER leading to its inability to undergo intracellular transport (61), and the Tg so entrapped can never arrive at distal compartments wherein posttranslational modifications including iodination take place (109–111). Likewise, alterations in Tg coding sequence could cause a similar defect in Tg folding and export. In this situation, diminished thyroid hormone synthesis may be viewed as a direct consequence of the decreased amount of Tg that can escape from the clutches of quality controllers in the ER (Fig. 1). In this way, what has been conceptualized as reduced hormonogenesis due to a “qualitative defect” in Tg structure (112,113) in the context of the thyroid gland is likely to be perceived as a “quantitative deficiency” in the Tg that is secreted, which is the most common type of Tg defect in humans.

Congenital hypothyroidism due to defective Tg transport has long been viewed merely as an hypothesis (114–116), but progressively accumulating reports of this condition [recently summarized in (117)] provide a strong basis for this view. In addition, let us consider a recently documented case of a boy with elevated TSH detected immediately after birth, who developed a sufficiently enlarged diffuse goiter such that by 5½ years of age, his serum thyroid hormone levels had achieved normality (118). Nevertheless, the underlying defect was still demonstrable since there was abnormal perchlorate discharge of radioiodine and no distinct increase in serum Tg in a TRH stimulation test. Light and electron microscopy showed absence of Tg in colloid, and presence of intracellular Tg in a markedly distended ER. Comparative Coomassie-blue stained SDS-PAGE of thyroid tissue from the patient and normal human thyroid showed the additional presence of large quantities of proteins at molecular masses 94 and 78 kDa in the patient—sizes that coincidentally correspond precisely to those of ER chaperones GRP94 and BiP. Recent studies have confirmed and extended these findings to unrelated kindreds with the same phenotype. Specifically, it is now established that the extra stainable thyroid proteins in this illness do indeed represent massively induced levels of GRP94 and BiP, strongly suggesting that selective induction of ER chaperones is part of the physiologic response to the accumulated misfolded Tg (119).

Finally, recent evidence has demonstrated a similar phenotype in cog/cog mice, animals which carry two identically-defective Tg alleles (120–126). In this mouse model of congenital hypothyroid goiter, it has recently been determined that newly-synthesized Tg exhibits defective conformational maturation such that little or no homodimers are formed (40). As a consequence, ER chaperones such as GRP94 and BiP are markedly induced, and they appear to exert a quality control function which limits the export of defective Tg from the ER, resulting in a major decrease in the fraction of Tg that reaches the follicle lumen (Fig. 1).

PROTEIN TRAFFIC FROM THE GOLGI COMPLEX TO THE APICAL AND BASOLATERAL CELL SURFACES

After completion of folding and export from the ER, exportable proteins are transported through proximal portions of the Golgi complex before arriving at the trans-Golgi network (TGN). The role of the Golgi complex (127,128) in posttranslationally modifying Tg and other secretory proteins, and details of these modifications such as carbohydrate processing (129–134), sulfation of carbohydrate and polypeptide backbone (135–140), and phosphorylation (141–144), as well as possible regulation of these modifications by TSH (145–147) have been described elsewhere. A distinguishing function of the TGN is that it can serve as an important sorting site for different proteins destined for the apical and basolateral surfaces of epithelial cells (148).

Although great progress has been made, we are still far from characterizing all molecules utilizing the apical and basolateral exocytotic routes (110,149), which are directly or indirectly involved in the synthesis of thyroid hormones in Tg (Fig. 4). However, the development of thyroid epithelial monolayers cultured on porous filters as a model system (150–157), and the identification of different newly synthesized secretory proteins that exhibit oppositely directed release from these cells, is a good first step in prov-

FIG. 4. Schematic of thyroid epithelial polarity. The polarity of thyroid follicular cells, which is essential for hormonogenesis, is produced and maintained largely by polarized sorting of new proteins into transport vesicles for direct delivery from the TGN to the apical or basolateral cell surfaces (cell at center). Diffusion from apical to basolateral sides is largely prevented by tight junctions, as shown. Several thyroid membrane proteins, including TPO (cell at right) and Na/K-ATPase (cell at left) are directly delivered to opposite sides of thyrocytes. The basolateral membrane is also the site of residence of the Na/I symporter and the type 1 (5')-thyroxine deiodinase (cell at center), while the apical membrane is the site of the I⁻ channel designed for apical iodide efflux (cell at left). Two high molecular weight secretory proteins, Tg and TSP, are also secreted from the two opposite sides (see text).

ing the existence of sorting for polarized trafficking through the protein export pathway.³ In the next paragraphs, we briefly review two oppositely secreted markers of these routes, TSP and Tg, before discussing polarized protein sorting mechanisms, and finally, considerations related to the sorting of a number of thyroid plasma membrane proteins.

**Thrombospondin 1 (TSP)**

It has long been suspected that epithelial cells synthesize and secrete their own basement membrane components (158,159) and thyrocytes are no exception (160,161), but only recently has it been proved that thrombospondin 1 (TSP), a protein found in the substratum underlying many glandular epithelia (162–164), is synthesized in large quantities by primary thyrocytes (165) and by FRTL5 cells (166), from which the protein is secreted mostly but not exclusively to the basolateral surface (86,167), which is exposed to serum proteins. Indeed, serum factors such as EGF and TGF-β are known either to stimulate production of TSP, or use binding to TSP as part of their biological action, respectively (168). Because these same factors are now believed to exert important regulatory influences on thyroid architecture, growth, and folliculogenesis (169–172), it seems probable that these processes will be influenced by TSP; thus, TSP may need to be included for consideration on the list of thyroid autocrine regulatory factors (173). Interestingly, “fibroblast growth factors” [which stimulate TSP production (168)] have been recently described at markedly increased levels in follicular adenomas and papillary cancer (174). Nevertheless, it remains to be determined whether local glandular TSP levels will be found to be altered in different physiological and pathological thyroid states.

³A theoretical possibility should be noted: if not recognized by the epithelial sorting machinery, soluble secretory proteins will enter multiple routes, largely in proportion to the volumes carried by those vesicular transport pathways (289–291). Further, we must acknowledge a phenomenon known as transcytosis, involving initial protein delivery to one side of the epithelium, before subsequent rerouting to the opposite side (235,292,293). [Indeed, while transcytosis of certain proteins theoretically could confound the interpretation of polarized vesicle delivery from the TGN, in culture, secreted proteins are diluted into large volumes of bathing medium so that little transcytosis of secretory proteins is generally observed (86)].

Because TSP binds to other basement membrane components that, when newly synthesized, are themselves sorted for basolateral delivery, one hypothesis is that TSP might use a secondary sorting mechanism (i.e., attach itself to laminin or other basolaterally-sorted proteins), and be carried in a complex with other sorted molecules. Obviously, considerable investigation is still needed to explore this possibility.

**Tg**

The physiological role of Tg in the thyroid has been amply reviewed (149, 175, 176). For this most abundant thyroid secreted protein, the predominance of apical delivery is beyond dispute (177, 178). However, the molecular mechanism(s) by which Tg is sorted into apical-bound transport vesicles remain unclear. Indeed, there are just two hypotheses available so far.

The first hypothesis is that in epithelial cells, sorting for apical secretion of newly synthesized glycoproteins is mediated by one or more endogenous lectins (179). Indeed, a thyroid lectin-like binding protein for asialo-agalacto carbohydrates (180, 181), with primary binding activity to terminal N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) residues (182) has recently been cloned (183) and may be concentrated in the subapical and apical regions of thyrocytes (184, 185). However, several difficulties with this hypothesis still remain. First, the GlcNAc receptor would appear far less likely to act in the secretory pathway as opposed to the endocytic pathway (186, 187), because only ER core sugar addition is thought necessary to form an apical targeting signal despite that GlcNac transferase activities are confined to the Golgi complex (179, 188, 189), and because only in the endocytic pathway does the intraluminal pH fall to a level optimal for GlcNAc receptor binding (182). Further, treatment of thyrocytes with agents that inhibit carbohydrate processing at the level of ER glucosidases (deoxynojirimycin or castanospermine) or Golgi mannosidase 1 (deoxymannojirimicin) block the formation of terminal GlcNAc or lactosamine residues, but still do not prevent apical secretion of Tg (190, 191). Moreover, it must be noted that several basolaterally secreted thyroid proteins, such as TSP (176), have several N-linked glycans (92, 166) while other apical glycoproteins are still secreted apically from epithelial cells even under conditions where glycan addition is severely disturbed or abolished (192, 193).

The second hypothesis is that apical protein secretion from the thyroid employs a sorting mechanism different from that observed in constitutive secretory cells, but similar to the apical secretion exhibited by the exocrine salivary gland and pancreas (194), to which the thyroid is embryologically related. In exocrine tissues, apical secretion is conveyed predominantly by a pathway of secretagogue-stimulated exocytosis of storage granules (195), called “the regulated secretory pathway” (196). Sorting of luminal proteins for sequestration in storage granules is believed to involve a process of multimerization/condensation, which is especially favored under ionic conditions prevalent in the TGN and post-Golgi compartments (197, 198). Both heterophilic [self-nonself; (199, 200)] and homophilic (self-self) interactions (23) have been implicated in the condensation that accounts for sorting of secretory granule proteins. Interestingly, Tg exhibits features which suggest behavior as a regulated secretory protein. First, newly synthesized Tg reaches a compartment from which its secretion to the apical plasma membrane of filter-grown thyrocytes can be acutely stimulated by TSH (166, 178). Second, there is evidence for a modest intracellular post-Golgi storage pool of Tg, since after metabolic labeling to steady-state, TSH-stimulated thyrocytes also acutely relocate labeled Tg to the apical medium (86) in a manner too rapid to be attributed to increased synthesis (177, 201). Third, electron dense secretory vesicles accumulate in the subapical region of thyrocytes (202), especially if the cells are transiently relieved of TSH stimulation (203). Finally, acutely stimulated exocytotic release from the dense-core subapical vesicles to the follicle lumen occurs *in vivo*, as demonstrated both for newly made Tg (204) and for the surrounding vesicle membrane whose surface area is transiently added to the apical membrane (110).

Since Tg in thyrocytes is the predominant apical protein product, which achieves an extracellular concentration that exceeds 100 mg/mL (205), it is highly unlikely that heterophilic associations are important for its apical targeting. By contrast, homophilic associations between Tg molecules clearly exist (206–208), and can even extend to the point of covalent crosslinking (209, 210); however, it has not been established whether noncovalent higher order assembly occurs while Tg is still within the secretory pathway. Indeed, it is even possible that the first hypothesis above (regarding carbohydrate-based apical sorting) could be consistent with the second hypothesis (concerning multimerization-based apical sorting), since there is reason to believe that the complex carbohydrates of Tg influence its self-assembly properties (211).

It should be pointed out that when regulated secretory proteins are expressed after transfection in other heterologous regulated secretory cell types, they are frequently able to enter the regulated secretory pathway of the foreign cell (197). The reliability of this approach (212, 213), although not perfect, is sufficiently good that it is now being used to establish the existence of a regulated secretory pathway in different cell types, as well as to test for structural signals in secretory proteins that allow targeting to this route (214). Application of this methodology to thyrocytes is currently the subject of active investigation.

### New Developments in Epithelial Polarity and Sorting

The finding that most newly synthesized Tg and TSP are oppositely secreted by thyroid follicular cells (166), proves that there is intracellular protein sorting for polarized delivery in these cells, suggesting similar possibilities for thyroid plasma membrane proteins. What makes a membrane protein travel selectively to one side of an epithelium or the other? Analyses of both viral and endogenous membrane glycoproteins expressed in epithelial cells, using recombinant DNA approaches, have begun to reveal specific structural determinants required for polarized transport (215). Specifically, for proteins attached to the membrane by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor (i.e., the protein moiety itself is luminal), the anchor appears sufficient for polarized delivery (216, 217) that is typically [but
not in every case (218)] directed apically. In addition, studies with membrane glycoprotein chimeras as well as truncation mutants have suggested that the luminal domains of membrane proteins possess signals for apical transport (219–222) and this idea recently has been fitted to the notion that N-linked carbohydrates may be used as signals for polarized sorting (described above). On the other hand, for basolateral transport of membrane proteins, at least some of the information is contained within cytoplasmic/transmembrane domains (223) wherein specific tyrosine-containing motifs in the cytoplasmic tails are now recognized to be important for targeting (224–228). Of course it must be noted that most studies to date have employed single-spanning membrane proteins (229) with a type I topology (i.e., NH₂-terminus in the lumen). Further, it has not actually been excluded that specific basolateral targeting information can also exist in protein luminal domains (223, 230–233), just as apical targeting information could exist in cytoplasmic tail regions (234).

Does polarized sorting of newly-synthesized thyroid plasma membrane proteins also take place in the TGN? This is an important question, since recent studies have suggested that the site of polarized sorting may vary significantly, depending on the cell type (reviewed in 235, 236). So far, the best studied model system is the MDCK kidney cell line, where most newly synthesized plasma membrane proteins are sorted at the TGN for direct delivery to the apical or basolateral domain, using two compositionally distinct classes of transport vesicles (237). By contrast, in some cells, all newly synthesized apical membrane proteins may travel first to the basolateral plasmalemma, from where they are then selectively rerouted to the apical membrane via the process known as transcytosis, as occurs in hepatocytes (238). Moreover, direct delivery and transcytosis pathways can exist in combination to deliver apical membrane proteins to their final destination, as observed in intestinal Caco-2 cells (239–241) and in forming epithelia (reviewed in 242). In thyrocytes, there has been some recent confusion on this point. Specifically, elegant work done in FRT cells (not to be confused with the FRTL5 line) established that despite normal basolateral targeting of Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase (243), these cells display an atypical distribution of GPI-anchored proteins on the basolateral surface (218)—this and other findings were interpreted to suggest unique mechanisms for protein targeting in the thyroid epithelium (244). However, primary thyrocytes express substantially more differentiated thyroid functions than those found in FRT cells, in which there are important reasons to suspect that polarized protein sorting may be abnormal (245). Indeed, recent data prove that filter-grown primary thyroid follicular cells use direct delivery pathways from the TGN for polarized protein sorting; moreover, GPI-anchored thyrocyte proteins are distributed primarily to the apical surface (246).

### Basolaterally Polarized Thyrocyte Surface Proteins Are Part of the Machinery Designed for Iodide Availability

One of several important topics omitted from this discussion is the processing and trafficking of the TSH receptor (247, 248). Instead, this section describes molecules responsible for the availability of inorganic iodide to the thyrocyte, which begins at the basolateral plasma membrane. This iodide is provided from two sources: (a) reclaiming organic iodide by iodotyrosine and iodothyronine deiodinases, and (b) new entry of iodide delivered from the bloodstream.

To our knowledge, no thyroid iodotyrosine deiodinase has yet been cloned or specifically localized (249); neither has a type II (5′)-deiodinase (250) nor type III (5)-deiodinase (251) yet been identified in the thyroid. By contrast, considerable molecular and cellular knowledge about the type I thyroxine (5′)-deiodinase has accrued, including a cloned cDNA (252) as well as reagents for localizing the protein and the activity in thyrocytes. This protein has a vanishingly small NH₂-terminal luminal domain, a single membrane spanning sequence, and a large catalytic domain on the cytoplasmic side (253). Using antipeptide sera (254), immunoperoxidase reaction product accumulates strongly in the cytoplasm of thyroid tissue, and immunofluorescent localization on FRTL5 cells yields a cytoplasmic fluorescence (255). These findings are consistent with older cell fractionation studies in hepatocytes that have argued in favor of a predominantly ER localization (256); however, cell fractionation studies in rat renal tubular epithelial cells have indicated the presence of this activity on the basolateral plasma membrane, and affinity-labeling of the 27-kDa protein is also associated with the basolateral plasmalemma in the LLC-PK1 kidney-derived cell line (257). Recent studies have confirmed and extended the idea that structural information in this protein specifies basolateral targeting in primary porcine thyrocytes, as also occurs when the rat enzyme is stably expressed by transfection of MDCK cells (258). Because this protein is undoubtedly translated in the ER, and ER export is frequently a rate-limiting step in protein transport to the plasma membrane (see above), the demonstration of a specific basolateral localization of the type 1 thyroxine (5′)-deiodinase is not incompatible with the presence of an additional ER pool of enzyme.

Production of an uphill Na⁺ concentration gradient between thyroid follicular cells and the bloodstream is a part of the iodide uptake process attributed to a basolaterally distributed Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase (259–264), although this has been demonstrated only in the past decade (151, 265). As in MDCK cells (266), both the distribution and delivery of newly-synthesized Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase molecules are basolaterally polarized in filter-grown primary thyrocytes (246). As expected, the signals specifying a basolateral distribution of the Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase are quite complex: some structural information is required for assembly of alpha and beta subunits (267); further structural information is contained in one or more domains that assist polarized delivery (268); additional structural information may cause interaction with other surface proteins that can stabilize the basolaterally targeted molecules (269); while yet additional structural information may regulate endocytosis of surface molecules (270).

With respect to the transporter responsible for basolateral iodide uptake, very recently the molecule was cloned and sequenced (271). The cDNA encodes a 65 kDa protein that demonstrates the expected biophysical properties of a Na/I symporter upon expression in Xenopus oocytes
(263) and is predicted to have 12 membrane-spanning domains (271). Although we currently know very little about the structural information that specifies protein targeting of the basolateral iodide symporter, this is clearly going to be an interesting area in the coming years.

### Apically Polarized Thyrocyte Surface Proteins Are Part of the Iodination Machinery

As has been reviewed previously, four of the essential components of the apical iodination system include available hydrogen peroxide, Tg, iodide, and thyroid peroxidase (TPO) (110, 149). Unfortunately, characterization of the apical peroxide generating system has not yet reached the stage of cloned cDNAs (272–275), and will not be discussed further here; nor will Tg (discussed above).

Even before cloning of the basolateral Na/I symporter (271), it had become increasingly apparent that yet another thyroid iodide transport system, for the apical cell surface, was also needed for transepithelial iodide transport (152, 153). Indeed, evidence from filter-polarized thyrocytes has suggested the presence of an apical iodide channel which is responsible for acute iodide efflux from the thyrocyte in response to TSH (156). However, this system still awaits further molecular definition, so that considerations of protein targeting are premature.

TPO is a particularly interesting membrane protein for which a cDNA has become available in the past decade (276, 277), encoding a large luminal, amino-terminal catalytic domain [when expressed as a truncated form devoid of its membrane anchor, this domain is sufficient to form a secreted active peroxidase (278)] and a relatively small cytoplasmic tail. While the large amino terminal domain is clearly N-glycosylated (279), exhibiting the potential to serve as apical sorting information (see above), the cytoplasmic tail also exhibits potential sequences that may be recognized by cytosolic adaptor proteins involved in apical sorting or internalization (228, 234). This is likely to be a useful and productive area for future research.

Successful iodothyronine formation by TPO requires its localization to the membrane delimiting the compartment(s) in which Tg is entrapped. The topology of TPO in the membrane indicates that it faces Tg throughout the secretory pathway (110) as well as at the apical extracellular space (154, 280, 281). This leaves open the possibility that a quantitatively minor, initial iodination of Tg might occur intracellularly in the secretory pathway in addition to the quantitatively major fraction that occurs in the follicle lumen (109, 111, 282). The potential physiological significance is that initial iodination of Tg is believed to occur preferentially on hormonogenic tyrosine residues (283, 284). Moreover, a persistent intracellular pool of previously-synthesized TPO is clearly detected in filter-grown thyrocytes, in addition to that found on the apical cell surface (246). Remarkably, when TPO is expressed recombinantly in CHO cells, it appears capable of iodinating proteins that are retained within the ER (285), and this is consistent with the postulate that iodination of newly synthesized Tg by TPO could occur in this compartment (286). However, when Tg iodinated intracellularly in filter-grown thyrocytes is analyzed, it is exclusively found as a form that has already undergone Golgi carbohydrate modification.

### SUMMARY

Much of thyroid physiology depends upon delivery of thyrocyte gene products for exocytosis at the apical and basolateral plasma membranes. To reach these destinations, newly-synthesized proteins in the thyrocyte secretory pathway, such as Tg, first must fold to a native or near-native state (Fig. 2) in order to escape quality control mechanisms that involve molecular chaperones, which regulate exit from the endoplasmic reticulum (Fig. 1). After this, specific signals found on exportable proteins must be recognized by cellular machinery to identify molecules such as Tg, which is conveyed apically, and thrombospondin (TSP), which is directed primarily to the basolateral cell surface. Different steps in posttranslational maturation, such as carbohydrate addition or protein assembly events, have been hypothesized to serve as sorting information for apical or basolateral export of secretory proteins. In addition, thyrocytes direct the polarized delivery of newly-synthesized plasma membrane proteins, which are essential for the physiology of thyroid hormonogenesis (Fig. 4). Most evidence points to the trans-Golgi network as the intracellular compartment in which polarized protein sorting takes place in thyrocytes. Despite good progress that is being made in these areas, major effort is still needed to understand the basic mechanisms of protein targeting for protein export in general, and for the thyroid in particular.
