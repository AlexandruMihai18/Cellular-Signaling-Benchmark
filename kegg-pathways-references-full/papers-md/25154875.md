ABSTRACT The endocannabinoid system is an important player in energy metabolism by regulating appetite, lipolysis, and energy expenditure. Chronic blockade of the cannabinoid 1 receptor (CB1R) leads to long-term maintenance of weight loss and reduction of dyslipidemia in experimental and human obesity. The molecular mechanism by which CB1R blockade reverses dyslipidemia in obesity has not yet been clarified. In this study, we showed that CB1R blockade with the systemic CB1R blocker rimonabant enhanced whole-body energy expenditure and activated brown adipose tissue (BAT), indicated by increased expression of genes involved in BAT thermogenesis and decreased lipid droplet size in BAT. This was accompanied by selectively increased triglyceride (TG) uptake by BAT and lower plasma TG levels. Interestingly, the effects on BAT activation were still present at thermoneutrality and could be recapitulated by using the strictly peripheral CB1R antagonist AM6545, indicating direct peripheral activation of BAT. Indeed, CB1R blockade directly activated T37i brown adipocytes, resulting in enhanced uncoupled respiration, most likely via enhancing cAMP/PKA signaling via the adrenergic receptor pathway. Our data indicate that selective targeting of the peripheral CB1R in BAT has therapeutic potential in attenuating dyslipidemia and obesity.

THE ENDOCANNABINOID SYSTEM regulates a broad range of physiological functions (1) and consists of G-protein-coupled cannabinoid receptors, its endogenous lipid ligands (endocannabinoids), and the enzymes involved in the biosynthesis and degradation of endocannabinoids (2, 3). The cannabinoid type 1 receptor (CB1R) is expressed at high levels in the brain but also at functionally relevant concentrations in various peripheral tissues (1). In contrast, the cannabinoid type 2 receptor is mainly expressed on immune cells

(4). CB1R-knockout mice display reduced adiposity and are resistant to diet-induced obesity (5). Moreover, overweight and obese humans exhibit an overactive endocannabinoid system (6, 7), suggesting a role of the endocannabinoid system in energy metabolism.

Chronic systemic blockade of the CB1R with the inverse agonist rimonabant leads to long-term maintenance of weight loss and reduction of dyslipidemia in obese rodents (8, 9) and humans (10–13). Rimonabant was considered one of the most promising therapeutic drugs to treat obesity, until the appearance of central psychiatric side effects resulted in its removal from the market in 2008. Nevertheless, several lines of evidence indicate that the effect of CB1R blockade is not restricted to a central mode of action, especially since the CB1R has been shown to be present in peripheral tissues including the liver (14), skeletal muscle (15), and adipocytes (16). More specifically, Tam *et al.* (17) recently showed that the strictly peripheral CB1R antagonist AM6545 induced weight loss and diminished hepatic steatosis in a mouse model. Thus, it seems plausible that psychiatric side effects can be avoided by strict peripheral blockade of the CB1R, while retaining the beneficial antiobesity and lipid-lowering effects.

Despite clear evidence that pharmacological CB1R antagonism improves dyslipidemia, the exact mechanisms and the peripheral tissues involved have not yet been elucidated. Recently, brown adipose tissue (BAT) emerged as an important player in triglyceride (TG) clearance (18). In contrast to white adipose tissue (WAT), which stores excess TG as fat, BAT dissipates energy into heat, a process mediated by mitochondrial uncoupling protein 1 (UCP-1; ref. 19). The best known trigger for activation of BAT is cold, which increases sympathetic outflow from the hypothalamic temperature center toward BAT, leading to the release of norepinephrine and increased thermogenesis (19). Metabolically active BAT stores exist in adult humans (20–22), and BAT volume and activity are lower in obese subjects (22). In addition, BAT volume and activity are lower in South Asians, a population prone to develop type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease (23). Together, these findings have increased interest in the therapeutic potential of BAT to combat obesity and related disorders, such as dyslipidemia.

In this study, we aimed at elucidating the molecular mechanism by which CB1R blockade attenuates dyslipidemia in diet-induced obesity by using a mouse model for human-like lipoprotein metabolism.

human-like lipoprotein metabolism and respond to lipid-lowering pharmacological interventions (24–26). In all the studies described below, 10 wk old E3L.CETP male mice were housed under standard conditions in conventional cages in a 12h light-dark cycle with *ad libitum* access to food and water, and were fed a high-fat diet (HFD; 60% lard fat; Research Diets, New Brunswick, NJ, USA) for 12 wk to induce obesity. From wk 7 onward, the drinking water was supplied with 10% fructose. All mouse experiments were performed in accordance with the Institute for Laboratory Animal Research Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and have received approval from the Departmental Ethical Review Board (Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands).

### Pharmacological intervention

After 12 wk of HFD, diet-induced obesity (DIO) model mice were randomized according to their body weight and plasma total cholesterol (TC) and TG levels into 4 groups. Subsequently, mice were housed at either 21°C (subthermoneutral) or 28°C (thermoneutral) and received 60% HFD with or without 10 mg/kg body weight/day (0.00885%, w/w) rimonabant (Axon Medchem, Groningen, The Netherlands) or AM6545 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) for 4 wk.

### Body weight and food intake

In all experiments, mice were housed individually during the 4 wk treatment period. Food intake was recorded daily by weighing the food that was left in the cage or was recorded automatically in metabolic cages (see below). Body weight was measured 2×/wk.

### Indirect calorimetry and physical activity

Indirect calorimetry was performed in fully automatic metabolic cages (LabMaster System; TSE Systems, Bad Homburg, Germany) during wk 4 of treatment. After 20 h acclimatization, oxygen uptake (*Vo₂*), carbon dioxide production (*Vco₂*) and caloric intake were measured for 5 consecutive days. Carbohydrate (CHO) and fat oxidation rates were calculated from *Vo₂* and *Vco₂* as described previously (27). Total energy expenditure (EE) was calculated from *Vo₂* and *Vco₂* using the Weir equation (28). Physical activity was measured using infrared sensor frames.

### Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan

After 4 wk treatment, body composition was measured by DEXA using the Norland pDEXA Sabre X-ray bone densitometer (Norland Medical Systems, Basingstoke, UK). Mice were anesthetized intraperitoneally with a combination of 6.25 mg/kg acepromazine (Alfasan, Woerden, The Netherlands), 6.25 mg/kg midazolam (Roche, Mannheim, Germany), and 0.31 mg/kg fentanyl (Janssen-Cilag, High Wycombe, UK). The total body of the mice was scanned, yet the heads were excluded from the analyses.

### Plasma parameters

After 4–6 h of food withdrawal, blood was collected from the tail vein of mice into chilled capillaries that were coated with paraoxon (Sigma-Aldrich) to prevent ongoing lipolysis (29). Capillaries were placed on ice and centrifuged, and plasma was assayed for TG, TC, and phospholipid (PL) content using commercially available enzymatic kits for TG and TC (Roche)

## MATERIALS AND METHODS

### Animals and diet

Homozygous human cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) transgenic mice were crossbred with hemizygous APOE*3-Leiden (E3L) mice at our Institutional Animal Facility to obtain E3L.CETP mice, as described previously (24). We chose to perform our studies in this specific mouse model, since these mice are a well-established model for
Diagnostics) and PL (Instruchemie, Delfzijl, The Netherlands). Free fatty acids (FFAs) were measured using the NEFA C kit (Wako Diagnostics; Instruchemie).

**Lipoprotein profiles**

To determine lipid distribution over plasma lipoproteins, pooled plasma was used for fast performance liquid chromatography (FPLC). Plasma was injected onto a Superose 6 column (Äkta System; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ, USA) and eluted at a constant flow rate of 50 μl/min with PBS (pH 7.4). TG and TC were measured as described above in collected fractions of 50 μl.

Triton WR-1339 (Sigma-Aldrich) was injected intravenously (0.5 mg/g body weight, 10% solution in PBS) to block serum VLDL-TG clearance. Blood samples were drawn before (*t* = 0) and at 15, 30, 60, and 90 min after injection of Triton WR-1339 and used for determination of plasma TG concentration as described above. After 90 min, mice were exsanguinated *via* the retroorbital plexus. VLDL was isolated from serum after density gradient ultracentrifugation at *d* < 1.006 g/ml by aspiration (32) and examined for incorporated \[^{35}S\] activity.

RNA isolation and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis

Total RNA was isolated with the Nucleospin RNA II Kit (Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA (1 μg) was reverse transcribed with iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA), and the obtained cDNA was purified with NucleoSpin Extract II kit (Macherey-Nagel). Real-time PCR was carried out on the IQ5 PCR machine (Bio-Rad) using the Sensimix SYBR Green RT-PCR mix (Quantace, London, UK). Melt curve analysis was included to ensure that a single PCR product was formed. Expression levels were normalized using glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (*Gapdh*), β2-microglobulin, and 36b4 as housekeeping genes. Primer sequences are listed in Table 1.

**In vivo clearance of labeled very low density lipoprotein (VLDL)-like emulsion particles**

VLDL-like TG-rich emulsion particles (80 nm) labeled with glycerol tri[^3^H]oleate ([^3^H]TO) were prepared and characterized as described previously (30). To study the *in vivo* clearance of the VLDL-like particles, mice were denied access to food for 4 h and injected (*t* = 0) *via* the tail vein with 200 μl of emulsion particles (1.0 mg TG/mouse). Blood samples were taken from the tail vein at 2, 10, 20, and 30 min after injection to determine the serum decay of [^3^H]TO. Plasma volumes were calculated as 0.04706 × body weight (g) as determined from \[^{125}\]I-BSA clearance studies as described previously (31). After the last blood sample was taken, mice were cervically dislocated and perfused with ice-cold PBS *via* the heart to remove blood from the organs. Subsequently, the liver, heart, spleen, hind-limb muscle, gonadal WAT (gWAT), subcutaneous WAT (sWAT), and BAT were collected. Organs were dissolved overnight at 60°C in Tissue Solubilizer (Amersham Biosciences, Rosendaal, The Netherlands), and ^3^H activity was quantified. Uptake of [^3^H]TO-derived radioactivity by the organs was reported per gram wet tissue weight.

**In vivo hepatic VLDL-TG and VLDL-apolipoprotein B (apoB) production**

To measure VLDL production *in vivo*, mice were denied access to food for 4 h and anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of 6.25 mg/kg acepromazine (Alfasan), 6.25 mg/kg midazolam (Roche) and 0.31 mg/kg fentanyl (Janssen-Cilag). Mice were injected intravenously with Tran[^35^S] label (150 μCi/mouse; MP Biomedicals, Eindhoven, The Netherlands) to label newly produced apoB. After 30 min, at *t* = 0 min,

**Histology**

Interscapular BAT, liver, and sWAT were removed and fixed directly in 4% paraformaldehyde, dehydrated, and embedded in paraffin. For UCP-1 staining in BAT, sections (5 μm) were dewaxed in xylene, rehydrated in ethanol, and treated with 3% H~2~O~2~ (Sigma-Aldrich) in absolute methanol for 30 min. Next, sections were immersed in 10 mM citrate buffer (pH 6.0), boiled for 10 min, and cooled at room temperature. Slides were blocked for 60 min with normal goat serum (1:75 in PBS) and incubated overnight at 4°C with rabbit monoclonal anti-UCP-1 antibodies (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) diluted 1:400 in normal goat serum (1:75). Next, sections were incubated for 60 min with biotinylated goat α-rabbit secondary antibodies (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) diluted 1:600 in normal goat serum (1:75). Immunostaining was amplified using Vector Laboratories Elite ABC kit (Vector Laboratories), and the immunoperoxidase complex was visualized with Nova Red (Vector Laboratories). Counterstaining

was performed with Mayer's hematoxylin (1:4). Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining of liver and sWAT sections was done using standard protocols. Intracellular lipid content in BAT was quantified by use of ImageJ 1.47 (U.S. National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA).

### Liver lipid extraction

Lipids were extracted from livers consistent with a modified protocol from Bligh and Dyer (33). Small liver samples (~50 mg) were homogenized in 10 μl of ice-cold methanol per milligram of tissue. Lipids were extracted into an organic phase by addition of 1800 μl of CH₃OH:CHCl₃ (3:1, v/v) to 45 μl of homogenate and subsequent centrifugation. The lower, organic phase was dried and suspended in 2% Triton X-100. Hepatic TG and TC concentrations were measured using commercial kits, as explained above. Liver lipids were reported per milligram of protein, as determined using the BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA).

#### In vitro experiments with white adipocytes

3T3-L1 cells [mouse embryonic fibroblast cells, CCL 92.1; American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), Manassas, VA, USA] were cultured at 37°C under 5% CO₂ in DMEM containing GlutaMAX (4.5 mg/ml L-D-glucose and sodium pyruvate; Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS; Gibco), 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Gibco). Confluent 3T3-L1 cells were induced to differentiate by treatment with a combination of 1.5 μM insulin, 0.5 mM 3-isobutyl-l-methylxanthine (IBMX; Sigma-Aldrich), and 1 μM dexamethasone (Sigma-Aldrich). After 48 h of treatment, the differentiation was maintained by addition of culture medium that contained 10 μM insulin. After 15 d of differentiation, cells were stimulated for 8 h with rimonabant (Axon Medchem) at 0.1 or 1 μM or with vehicle (DMSO). Then, 500 μl of supernatant was collected and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen.

#### Protein isolation and Western blot

T37i cells or snap-frozen tissue samples were lysed in ice-cold buffer containing 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.6), 50 mM NaF, 50 mM KCl, 5 mM NaPPi, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM DTT, 5 mM β-glycerophosphate, 1 mM sodium vanadate, 1% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors using cocktail tablets (Roche). Homogenates were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 15 min at 4°C, and the protein content of the supernatant was determined using the BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific). Proteins (20 μg) were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE followed by transfer to a polyvinylidene fluoride transfer membrane (Merck, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). Membranes were blocked for 1 h at room temperature in Tris-buffered saline Tween-20 buffer with 5% nonfat dry milk, followed by an overnight incubation with specific primary antibodies. Primary antibodies specific for CB1R, E2-F, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), P-AMPK, acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), P-ACC, P-hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) (Ser563), P-HSL (Ser565), and tubulin were purchased from Cell Signaling (Leiden, The Netherlands). A primary antibody specific for UCP-1 was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. All antibodies were diluted 1:1000. Blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. Bands were visualized with SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA) and quantified using ImageJ 1.47.

#### Oxygen consumption measurements

A Seahorse Bioscience XF24 extracellular flux analyzer (Seahorse Biosciences, North Billerica, MA, USA) was used to measure oxygen consumption rate (OCR) in differentiated T37i cells. T37i cells were differentiated in T75 flasks. On d 9 of differentiation, the cells were trypsinized and seeded in poly-D-lysine (Sigma-Aldrich)-coated 24-well Seahorse assay plates. The next day, the cells were treated with DMSO vehicle or rimonabant (1 μM). After 4 h, the cells were placed in freshly prepared Seahorse medium (DMEM with 5 mM glucose and 1 mM pyruvate, pH 7) and incubated for 1 h in a 37°C incubator without supplemental CO₂. The ATP synthetase inhibitor oligomycin and the β3-specific agonist CL316,243 (Tocris, Ellisville, MO, USA) were preloaded in the reagent delivery chambers of the Seahorse sensor cartridge and then pneumatically injected into the wells to reach final working concentrations. Three baseline OCR measurements were performed, followed by injection with CL316,243 to a final concentration of 1 μM or oligomycin to a final concentration of 0.5 μM. Postexposure OCR was measured 3 times after 2 min of mixing. The averages of 3 baseline measurements and 3 postexposure OCRs were used for data analyses.

#### Statistical analysis

All data are expressed as means ± sem. Statistical analysis using the unpaired 2-tailed Student’s t-test was performed with the SPSS 20.0 software package for Windows (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA) to determine differences between vehicle- and compound-treated groups. A value of \( P < 0.05 \) was considered statistically significant.

### RESULTS

#### Systemic CB1R blockade by rimonabant in DIO mice reduces obesity and dyslipidemia and increases EE

To investigate the effect of systemic CB1R blockade on body composition and energy balance, E3L.CETP transgenic mice were fed an HFD for 12 wk to render them obese (mean body weight: 53.2±0.9 g) and

treated with rimonabant or vehicle for 4 wk. Rimonabant elicited a profound decrease in body mass (−25%, P<0.001; Fig. 1A), which was not due to a decrease in lean mass but rather to a massive decrease in fat mass (−32%, P<0.001; Fig. 1B). Rimonabant decreased caloric intake transiently (*i.e.*, until d 6; Fig. 1C), in accordance with previous observations (35, 36), while it persistently induced weight loss throughout the treatment period (*i.e.*, 4 wk). Furthermore, rimonabant markedly diminished plasma TG levels (−59%, P<0.05) and TC levels (−40%, P<0.01) (Fig. 1D), which is in line with previous human studies (10–12). Rimonabant tended to reduce plasma PL levels (−31%, P=0.05) and had no effect on plasma FFA levels. Lipoprotein profiling showed that the marked decrease in plasma TG mostly resulted from a reduction in VLDL-TG ([area under the curve (AUC)] −62%; Fig. 1E]. The persistent reduction in body weight despite

the transient decrease in food intake following rimonabant treatment suggests increased EE. Indeed, rimonabant increased substrate utilization, reflected by increased fat oxidation (+18%, P<0.05; Fig. 1F), CHO oxidation (+18%, P<0.05; Fig. 1G), and consequently total EE (+17%, P<0.05; Fig. 1H), as measured *via* indirect calorimetry, without increasing locomotor activity (Fig. 1I) or respiratory quotient (RQ) values (data not shown).

Systemic CB1R blockade by rimonabant attenuates dyslipidemia by activating BAT

Plasma VLDL-TG levels are determined by the balance between hepatic VLDL-TG production and VLDL-TG clearance by lipoprotein lipase (LPL)-expressing peripheral organs. Therefore, to gain insight into the mechanism by which systemic CB1R antagonism re-

duces plasma VLDL-TG, we first assessed the effect of rimonabant on VLDL production. DIO mice were treated with rimonabant or vehicle for 4 wk and then sequentially injected with Tran\[^{35}S\] and Triton WR1339, resulting in linear accumulation of VLDL in which newly synthesized apolipoproteins were radiola- beled. Rimonabant did not affect the time-dependent accumulation of plasma TG following Triton injection (Fig. 2A). Therefore, the VLDL-TG production rate, as determined from the slope of the curve, was not significantly different. In addition, the rate of VLDL-apoB production did not change (Fig. 2B). In line with these observations, hepatic expression of lipogenic genes, such as fatty acid synthase (*Fasn*) and stearoyl-

Values are means ± SEM (*n*=9); expression of genes was corrected for the housekeeping genes β2-microglobulin and 36b4. *P* < 0.05, ***P* < 0.001 vs. control group.
CoA desaturase 1 (Scd1) was unchanged (Fig. 2C). Altogether, these data demonstrate that global CB1R antagonism does not diminish dyslipidemia by lowering hepatic VLDL-TG production.

To investigate whether rimonabant increases VLDL-TG clearance, we determined the kinetics of intravenously injected \[^3\text{H}]\text{TO}\)-labeled TG-rich VLDL-like emulsion particles, which have been previously shown to mimic the metabolic behavior of TG-rich lipoproteins (30), and studied the plasma clearance and organ distribution of \[^3\text{H}]\text{TO}\)-derived fatty acids (FAs) in mice treated with rimonabant or vehicle for 4 wk. Rimonabant accelerated clearance of \[^3\text{H}]\text{TO}\) from plasma (\(t_{1/2}=3.9 \pm 0.6\) vs. \(6.4 \pm 0.4\) min, \(P<0.05\); Fig. 2D), as explained by increased uptake of \[^3\text{H}]\text{TO}\)-derived activity by energy-dissipating BAT (+53%, \(P<0.05\); Fig. 2E). Of note, rimonabant decreased the uptake of \[^3\text{H}]\text{TO}\) by the energy-storing sWAT depot (−42%, \(P<0.05\)).

To further investigate the mechanism by which systemic CB1R blockade increased FA uptake by BAT, we determined the mRNA expression of genes involved in BAT differentiation, BAT activity, TG lipolysis, and FA uptake. Rimonabant did not affect expression of genes involved in BAT differentiation (\textit{Pgc1α}, \textit{Prdm16}) and intracellular lipolysis (\textit{Hsl}, \textit{Atgl}; data not shown). However, as shown in Fig. 2F, rimonabant increased expression of \textit{Lpl} (+30%, \(P<0.05\)) and \textit{Cd36} (+24%, \(P<0.05\)), which drive extracellular VLDL-TG lipolysis and subsequent uptake of FAs by BAT (18). In addition, rimonabant increased expression of \textit{Ucp1}, which encodes the uncoupling protein that mediates thermogenesis (+49%, \(P<0.05\)). Furthermore, histology showed a more intense immunohistochemical staining of UCP-1 in BAT (Fig. 2G) as well as a decrease in intracellular lipid droplet size, reflected by a decrease in relative lipid area (−39%, \(P<0.001\); Fig. 2H), both pointing to more active BAT (37). Thus, these data provide strong evidence that systemic CB1R antagonism diminishes dyslipidemia and increases EE, by promoting VLDL-TG uptake and subsequent combustion by BAT.

Systemic CB1R blockade by rimonabant diminishes TG storage in WAT and liver

To investigate whether the increased flux of TG toward BAT reduces ectopic TG accumulation, we analyzed WAT and the liver in more detail. Indeed, from the VLDL-TG clearance experiment, it appeared that retention of \[^3\text{H}]\text{TO}\)-derived activity by the energy-storing sWAT depot was diminished after rimonabant treatment (−42%, \(P<0.05\); Fig. 2E). In line with this, the cell size of white adipocytes was decreased in this depot, as evident after H&E staining (Supplemental Fig. S1A). In addition, rimonabant diminished expression of the lipogenic genes \textit{Fasn} (−58%, \(P<0.05\)) and \textit{Scd1} (−54%, \(P<0.05\)), while it increased expression of the lipolytic enzyme \textit{Hsl} (+126%, \(P<0.05\)) in WAT (Supplemental Fig.

S1B), suggesting net FA efflux from WAT. To investigate whether rimonabant may directly enhance intracellular lipolysis in WAT, we assessed its effect on glycerol release in 3T3-L1 cells, an *in vitro* model of differentiated white adipocytes. Rimonabant did not affect glycerol release (Supplemental Fig. S1C), suggesting that the enhanced FA efflux from WAT may occur secondary to the enhanced BAT activation.

In liver, rimonabant markedly decreased liver weight (Supplemental Fig. S2A), which was accompanied by a reduction in liver TG content (−45%, \(P<0.01\); Supplemental Fig. S2B) and smaller intracellular lipid vacuoles (Supplemental Fig. S2C). Furthermore, rimonabant caused a (likely compensatory) down-regulation of hepatic expression of genes involved in lipid oxidation, such as acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 1 (\textit{Acsl1}) and \textit{Acc2} (Supplemental Fig. S2D), while genes involved in lipogenesis were not affected (Fig. 2C). Thus, these data suggest that systemic CB1R blockade reduces storage of TG in WAT and liver, which may, at least in part, be a consequence of increased FA demand and flux toward BAT.

Antiobesity and lipid-lowering effects of systemic CB1R blockade by rimonabant are not abrogated at thermoneutrality

BAT is densely innervated by the sympathetic nervous system (SNS; ref. 19). Therefore, one of the mechanisms by which systemic CB1R blockade may lead to BAT activation could involve central CB1R blockade resulting in increased sympathetic outflow toward BAT. To investigate whether rimonabant acts centrally by increasing SNS activation toward BAT, we next evaluated the effects of rimonabant in DIO mice that were housed at thermoneutral temperature (28°C). At thermoneutrality, rimonabant still markedly reduced obesity (Fig. 3A, B) without affecting lean mass. This was accompanied by a transient decrease in food intake (*i.e.*, until d 6; Fig. 3C). Notably, at thermoneutrality, rimonabant still lowered plasma TG (−70%, \(P<0.05\); Fig. 3D), which was mainly due to a reduction in VLDL-TG (AUC −52%; Fig. 3E). Furthermore, rimonabant still increased whole-body fat and CHO oxidation (Supplemental Fig. S3A, B), resulting in increased total EE (+21%, \(P<0.05\); Fig. 3F), accompanied by increased markers of BAT activation both on mRNA (Fig. 3G) and histological levels (Fig. 3H). Thus, these data suggest that the reduction in dyslipidemia, increase in EE, and activation of BAT by systemic CB1R blockade occurs, at least in part, independently of SNS activation of BAT.

In vitro CB1R blockade by rimonabant induces activation of brown adipocytes, which is, at least in part, mediated by PKA signaling

To explore the possibility that direct blockade of a CB1R in BAT may be responsible for the antiobesity PERIPHERAL CB1R BLOCKADE ACTIVATES BROWN FAT

and lipid-lowering effect induced by systemic CB1R blockade, we first investigated whether the CB1R is expressed on BAT. Indeed, Western blots on protein from tissues derived from untreated mice showed that the CB1R is highly expressed in BAT (Fig. 4A), even when compared with the expression in hypothalamus and liver. *In vitro* treatment of T37i brown adipocytes with rimonabant (1 μM) enhanced UCP-1 protein content (Fig. 4B). In line with this, we found a significantly elevated OCR in the cells on 5 h of treatment with rimonabant (+23%, *P*<0.05; Fig. 4C). Furthermore, under these conditions, oligomycin was less able to suppress OCR (Fig. 4D), pointing to enhanced uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation. Enhanced uncoupling may be the result of enhanced intracellular lipolysis, resulting in allosteric activation of UCP-1 (19). Indeed, we found that rimonabant dose-dependently increased glycerol release (Fig. 4E), pointing to increased intracellular lipolysis.

AMPK serves as an intracellular energy sensor, and activation of AMPK by means of phosphorylation results in enhanced FA and glucose oxidation in a variety of tissues, as well as control of lipolysis in white adipocytes (38). Of note, CB1R blockade has been shown to increase AMPK phosphorylation in both liver cells (39) and white adipocytes (40). In line with this, we found that *in vitro* treatment of cultured T37i brown

adipocytes with rimonabant for 8 h induced AMPK phosphorylation (Fig. 4F), as well as phosphorylation of ACC (Fig. 4G), the downstream effector of AMPK. Of note, the induction of AMPK phosphorylation was not yet present after 30 min of incubation with rimonabant (data not shown). Furthermore, rimonabant did not affect phosphorylation of Ser565-HSL (Fig. 4H), which is presumably the regulatory site by which the kinase controls HSL activity.

In contrast, rimonabant increased the phosphorylation of the PKA target residue on HSL (Ser563; Fig. 4I). As the Ser563 residue is phosphorylated by PKA, which is itself activated by cAMP, this suggests that the cAMP/PKA pathway, at least in part, mediates the enhanced intracellular lipolysis in brown adipocytes on CB1R blockade. Indeed, as shown in Fig. 4I, the combination of norepinephrine (which also signals through the cAMP/PKA pathway in brown adipocytes) and rimonabant even further enhanced p-HSL<sup>563</sup> content (+200%, *P* < 0.01). Moreover, in the presence of the PKA inhibitor H89, the enhanced pHSL<sup>563</sup> content induced on rimonabant was blunted (Fig. 4J).

Altogether, these data indicate that direct blockade of the CB1R on brown adipocytes directly stimulates intracellular lipolysis and UCP-1 protein content, as well as uncoupling, which may, at least in part, be mediated by cAMP-PKA signaling.

Strictly peripheral CB1R blockade by AM6545 reduces obesity and dyslipidemia and increases EE in DIO mice

To investigate whether peripheral CB1R blockade is sufficient to induce weight loss and reverse dyslipidemia *in vivo*, we treated DIO mice for 4 wk with vehicle or AM6545, a peripherally restricted CB1R antagonist that has been previously shown not to elicit central side effects (17). AM6545 markedly reduced body weight (−19%, \(P<0.001\); Fig. 5A) and fat mass (−23%, \(P<0.01\); Fig. 5B), without altering lean mass. AM6545 did not induce the initial transient decrease in food intake as seen with rimonabant, although a slight decrease was evident later during the treatment period (Fig. 5C). However, total caloric intake was not affected. Furthermore, AM6545 substantially decreased plasma TG levels (−49%, \(P<0.05\); Fig. 5D), which mostly resulted from a reduction in VLDL-TG (AUC −73%; Fig. 5E). In addition, AM6545 increased total EE (Fig. 5F), which was due to an increase in both fat and CHO oxidation (Fig. 5G, H). Thus, these data demonstrate that peripheral CB1R blockade is sufficient to diminish obesity and dyslipidemia in DIO.

Strictly peripheral CB1R blockade by AM6545 attenuates dyslipidemia by activating BAT

To investigate whether peripheral CB1R blockade also diminished dyslipidemia by increasing FA uptake by BAT, we again assessed VLDL-TG production and clearance. Just like rimonabant, AM6545 did not affect the production rates of VLDL-TG and VLDL-apoB (Fig. 6A, B) or hepatic expression of lipogenic genes

(Fig. 6C). Instead, AM6545 also accelerated clearance of [^3^H]TO-labeled VLDL-like emulsion particles from plasma (Fig. 6D), accompanied by a marked increase of ^3^H retention by BAT (+235%, *P*<0.01; Fig. 6E), and a decrease in ^3^H uptake by sWAT (−51%, *P*<0.01). In BAT, AM6545 increased expression of *Lpl* (+67%, *P*<0.05), *Cd36* (+59%, *P*<0.05), and *Ucp1* (+32%, *P*<0.05; Fig. 6F) and decreased lipid content (Fig. 6G), all pointing to increased BAT activity. AM6545 also decreased white adipocyte size (Supplemental Fig. S4A) and liver weight (−24%, *P*<0.001; Supplemental Fig. S4B) accompanied by a reduction in liver TG content

(−17%, *P*<0.05; Supplemental Fig. S4C) and lipid vacuole size (Supplemental Fig. S4D). Thus, peripheral CB1R blockade is sufficient to diminish dyslipidemia, and probably also obesity, by promoting VLDL-TG uptake and subsequent combustion of engulfed FA by BAT.

DISCUSSION

Systemic CB1R blockade by the inverse CB1R agonist rimonabant alleviates the excess body weight and dys-
lipidemia that are associated with obesity, both in mice and in humans (8–12). In this study, we demonstrate that systemic CB1R blockade reverses DIO and reduces plasma VLDL-TG by selectively increasing VLDL-TG clearance by metabolically active BAT followed by combustion. Of note, the mechanism involves peripheral activation of BAT, since the effects were still present at thermoneutrality and could be recapitulated by using the strictly peripheral (17) CB1R antagonist AM6545. Accordingly, cultured brown adipocytes could be activated by blockade of the CB1R with rimonabant.

Systemic CB1R blockade by rimonabant resulted in massive activation of BAT, as evidenced by reduced lipid content and increased UCP-1 expression, accompanied by increased EE, which is in accordance with previous studies (36, 41). Of note, by performing kinetic studies with radioactively labeled VLDL-TG, we provided clear evidence that the TG-lowering effect of rimonabant is due to increased uptake of TG-derived FAs by BAT. Since metabolically active BAT has been shown to be present and active in human adults (20–23), it is tempting to speculate that the body weight-reducing and TG-lowering effects of rimonabant previously found in obese subjects might be due to activation of BAT, although the precise role of BAT in TG metabolism in humans remains to be established.

Previous studies suggested central CB1R blockade as the main mechanism by which rimonabant induces BAT activation, resulting in increased sympathetic outflow toward BAT and increased EE (36, 41). For instance, Bajzer *et al.* (36) reported that denervation of BAT in mice blunted the effect of rimonabant on insulin-mediated glucose uptake. However, in their study, the increase in EE and the reduction in body weight and fat mass were not blunted by BAT denervation, suggesting that a peripheral mechanism is at least in part involved in these beneficial effects. Indeed, we found that treatment of DIO mice with the strictly peripheral CB1R antagonist AM6545 still resulted in increased EE accompanied by increased uptake of TG-derived FAs by BAT as well as significant weight loss and reduction in dyslipidemia. Furthermore, we showed that the CB1R is highly expressed in BAT. It is important to realize that this does not exclude the possibility that presynaptic CB1R on peripheral sympathetic nerve terminals innervating BAT may be the peripheral target whose blockade enhances BAT activation through enhanced norepinephrine release. However, the fact that we found that norepinephrine content in BAT was only increased on treatment with rimonabant at 21°C and not at thermoneutrality or on AM6545 treatment (data not shown) makes this mechanism less likely. In line with this, we found that rimonabant directly activated brown adipocytes *in vitro*, further supporting the possibility of a peripheral mode of action of CB1R blockade in BAT.

We found that systemic blockade of the CB1R by rimonabant did not affect VLDL-TG production following either systemic or selective peripheral CB1R blockade. In contrast, a study by Tam *et al.* (17) reported that blocking the peripheral CB1R by AM6545 treatment resulted in a marked increase in the production of VLDL-TG in both DIO C57Bl/6 and leptin-deficient ob/ob mice. This might be explained by differences in study setup, since Tam *et al.* (17) measured VLDL-TG production after 1 wk of treatment, while in the present study, VLDL-TG production was measured after 4 wk. Likely, CB1R blockade transiently increases VLDL-TG production, leading to a fast initial reduction in hepatic steatosis, as was also observed in their study. The subsequent normalization in VLDL production that we found in our study after 4 wk of treatment may then be the consequence of a lower supply of FFAs toward the liver for incorporation into VLDL-TG, since these are efficiently cleared by BAT.

While we provide clear evidence that the TG-lowering effect of CB1R blockade is due to peripheral activation of BAT, the mechanism by which CB1R blockade lowers body weight and fat mass is less clear, and no consistent mechanism has been reported up to date. Although BAT activation has been repeatedly shown to decrease body weight and fat mass (18, 42, 43), we cannot exclude the possibility that CB1R blockade on peripheral tissues other than BAT may contribute to the weight-reducing effect. For instance, the CB1R has been shown to be present on white adipocytes (16), and treatment of mice with rimonabant and AM6545 increased lipolysis (17, 44, 45). Accordingly, we also found that rimonabant increased mRNA expression of *Hsl* in subcutaneous WAT. The question remains whether the effect of rimonabant on WAT lipolysis is a primary effect or occurs as a consequence of enhanced BAT activation. As we did not observe a direct effect of rimonabant on glycerol release in 3T3L1 white adipocytes, it is more likely that the enhanced WAT lipolysis occurs secondary to BAT activation. Furthermore, the weight-reducing effect of global CB1R blockade is also, at least in part, due to an initial transient decrease in food intake induced by rimonabant. The greater efficacy of rimonabant over AM6545 in reducing body weight is then likely explained by the fact that AM6545 did not affect total caloric intake over the treatment period, as has been shown before (17). Thus, future studies are needed to elucidate the specific contribution of BAT in the weight-reducing effect of peripheral CB1R blockade.

It is interesting to speculate on the possible intracellular mechanisms by which CB1R blockade enhances BAT activity. One of the hallmarks of brown adipocyte activation is enhanced intracellular lipolysis, resulting in release of FA that can subsequently allosterically activate UCP-1 (19). In search for the pathway that is connected to induction of intracellular lipolysis by CB1R blockade, we measured the phosphorylation state of HSL on various regulatory residues in T37i cells on treatment with rimonabant. We found that rimonabant selectively enhanced p-HSL<sup>563</sup>, the residue that is phosphorylated by PKA, and that this effect could be blocked by addition of the PKA inhibitor H89.

Figure 7. Proposed mechanism by which CB1R antagonism enhances activation of BAT. CB1R antagonism abrogates the inhibition of β3 adrenergic signaling, and thereby enhances adenylyl cyclase activity, resulting in enhanced cAMP levels and activation of pPKA. PKA phosphorylates HSL on Ser563, leading to enhanced intracellular lipolysis and release of FA. FA can either undergo β oxidation or can allosterically activate UCP-1, resulting in enhanced uncoupling. In addition, PKA phosphorylates CREB, enhancing *Ucp1* transcription. The consequently decreasing TG pool within the intracellular lipid droplets is replenished by enhanced uptake of TG-derived FAs from TG-rich lipoproteins through lipolysis by LPL, followed by uptake of FAs from the plasma through CD36, eventually resulting in lowering of plasma TG levels. ATGL, adipose triglyceride; DG, diglyceride; MGL, monoacylglycerol lipase; MG, monoglyceride.

this suggests that rimonabant enhances the cAMP/PKA pathway in brown adipocytes. This mechanism is not surprising, as the major mediators in CB1R signaling are in fact G proteins of the G(i/o) family that inhibit adenylyl cyclases (46). Moreover, CB1R agonism in a variety of cell types inhibits adenylyl cyclase activity and thus cAMP levels (46). In addition, we found that CB1R blockade resulted in increased AMPK phosphorylation in brown adipocytes, which is in accordance with previous studies performed in hepatocytes (39) and white adipocytes (40). However, as AMPK may be activated in case of low intracellular ATP levels, the effect of rimonabant on the kinase might be secondary to enhanced uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation induced by rimonabant. Indeed, we found that p-AMPK was only enhanced in brown adipocytes after chronic and not acute stimulation with rimonabant. Thus, we propose a mechanism (Fig. 7) by which CB1R blockade on the brown adipocyte membrane results in enhanced cAMP/PKA signaling and phosphorylation of HSL (Ser563). This results in enhanced intracellular lipolysis and release of FA that subsequently activate UCP-1

resulting in enhanced uncoupling. As a secondary mechanism, uptake of VLDL-TG derived FA is enhanced through an increase of expression of *Lpl* and *Cd36*.

Together, our study shows that CB1R blockade diminishes dyslipidemia by inducing BAT-mediated VLDL-TG uptake and BAT thermogenesis via a peripheral mode of action. Our data suggest that blockade of the peripheral CB1R in BAT may be a promising therapy to combat obesity and to lower cardiovascular risk without inducing centrally mediated side effects.
