### Abstract

The specificity of plant acyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) thioesterases is the major determinant of the chain length and level of saturated fatty acids found in most plant tissues. Although these enzymes have been previously characterized from a number of sources, information on kinetic parameters for a wide range of substrates with cloned enzymes is lacking. In the present study the substrate specificity of recombinant FatA thioesterase isoforms from Arabidopsis (AtFatA) and coriander (CsFatA) and FatB from Arabidopsis (AtFatB) have been re-examined with a comprehensive range of substrates including 14:1-ACP and 16:1-ACP. AtFatA displayed the highest catalytic efficiencies (kcat/Km) towards oleoyl-ACP with activities at least 20-fold lower for all other tested substrates and 75-fold lower with palmitoyl-ACP. Both chain length and double bond presence strongly influenced kcat of FatA with minor influence on Km. Arabidopsis FatB substrate specificity was found to differ from previous reports and this difference could be attributed to the influence of ACP structure. FatB activity with palmitoyl-ACP was 2.5-fold higher and the ratio of 16:0-ACP/14:0-ACP hydrolysis was 6.4-fold higher with spinach ACP compared to *E. coli* ACP. Additionally, the influence of amino acid domains from both AtFatA and AtFatB on their substrate specificity was studied by utilizing a domain-swapping approach. The characterization of the resulting chimeric enzymes pointed to the N-terminus as a determinant of the substrate specificity for both FatA and FatB acyl-ACP thioesterases. © 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).

Fatty acid biosynthesis in higher plants occurs predominantly in the plastids by the action of a type II fatty acid synthase. This process involves the condensation of malonyl-ACP¹ with an acetyl-CoA primer or with previously synthesized acyl-ACP derivatives, resulting in the successive elongation of the acyl-ACP chain by two carbon units. Fatty acid synthesis is terminated by acyl-ACP thioesterases (E.C. 3.1.2.14) that hydrolyze the thioester bond existing between the acyl moiety and the ACP [1]. The released unesterified fatty acid products are then transported out of the plastid and incorporated primarily into glycerolipids after re-esterification to coenzyme A in the plastid envelope. In vivo demonstration of a free fatty acid intermediate in this process

was recently provided [2]. The specificities of the acyl-ACP thioesterases determine to a large extent the chain length and unsaturation of most plant fatty acids, both in membrane glycerolipids and in storage triacylglycerols [3]. The main products of the thioesterases and thus of plastidal fatty acid biosynthesis are oleate and to a lesser extent palmitate in the vegetative tissues of essentially all plants.

Acyl-ACP thioesterases are plastid-targeted soluble enzymes encoded by nuclear genes. Based on sequence alignments, these enzymes have been classified into two general families termed *FatA* and *FatB* [4]. The *FatA* and *FatB* enzymes differ also in substrate specificity. All *FatA* orthologs that have been examined possess similar substrate specificities among different species, with the highest activity towards 18:1Δ⁹-ACP [5, 6]. In contrast, *FatB* thioesterases encode a group of enzymes with more heterogeneous substrate specificity, but generally showing high activities towards saturated acyl-ACPs. The first *FatB* described was isolated from

Umbellularia californica endosperm [7,8]. This enzyme displayed high specificity towards 12:0-ACP which correlates with the composition of the oil present in the seeds of that species. Although FatB enzymes were initially described in species producing unusual fatty acids, later studies indicate that these enzymes are ubiquitous in higher plants. In this regard Grellet et al. [9] reported the presence of a *FatB*-like cDNA sequence in *Arabidopsis thaliana*, which was later characterized by Doermann et al. [10] and found to hydrolyze a range of saturated acyl substrates from C14 to C18 and also 18:1<sup>Δ9</sup>-ACP. More recent results with antisense and overexpression in transgenic Arabidopsis indicate that FatB is at least in part responsible for the biosynthesis of palmitic acid in different plant tissues [11].

Overexpression of specific acyl-ACP thioesterases has been demonstrated to be effective for the production of bioengineered oils. For example, overexpression of the *U. californica FatB1* gene in oilseed rape increased the laurate levels in the seed oil of this crop from negligible to over 50% of the total fatty acids [12]. These and other results indicate that acyl-ACP thioesterases can be key enzymes to produce specialty bioengineered oils, provided acyl-ACP thioesterases displaying high activities towards the target fatty acids are available. In addition to medium chain saturated fatty acids, the production of several unusual monoenes may be useful in transgenic oilseeds. For example, plant oils rich in petroselinic or palmitoleic acid represent alternatives to petroleum as a source of raw material for the production of biodegradable lubricants, surfactants, plastic precursors, and other products [13]. These monoenes are produced by plastidial acyl-ACP desaturases with unusual substrate specificity and a number of such desaturases have been cloned from different species [14–16]. Although several of these desaturases have now been overexpressed in oil crops or in the model plant *A. thaliana* the yield found of the desired monoene products has been low, ranging from 5% to 15% of the acyl fraction of seed triacylglycerols [17]. In addition, the initial product of the desaturase has often been elongated to yield less decidable products. One possible way to increase the yield of these fatty acids in the oil of transgenic plants could be the increase of their export from the plastids by the co-expression of a specific acyl-ACP thioesterase. This could reduce plastidial elongations of the desired monoene to unwanted products as well as potential feedback inhibition by desaturase products which accumulate in the acyl-ACP pool [18]. Nevertheless, there is little information about the activity displayed by FatAs or FatBs towards ACP derivatives of unusual monoenes and unlike in the case of desaturases no thioesterases specific for these substrates have yet been cloned. Only in the case of *Coriandrum sativum* an acyl-ACP thioesterase showing high activity towards unusual

monoenes (petroselinyl(18:1<sup>Δ6</sup>)-ACP) has been described [19].

As an alternative to isolating thioesterase genes specific for unusual monoenes, protein engineering may be useful to redesign thioesterase substrate specificity for target acyl-ACPs. Because there are no structural data for acyl-ACP thioesterases to guide the design, previous studies have relied on modification of the thioesterases by changing conserved amino acid residues. Guided by comparison of sequences of enzymes displaying different substrate specificities it was possible to convert the *U. californica FatB1* into a 14:0-ACP-specific thioesterase by changing only two residues [20] as well as to increase the specificity of *Garcinia mangostana* FatA towards 18:0-ACP by a single amino acid change [21]. In addition, some information about the regions involved in substrate specificity has been retrieved by swapping amino acid domains from different thioesterases and analyzing the properties of the resulting chimeric enzymes [22].

Previous studies of plant acyl-ACP thioesterase specificity have almost exclusively been conducted with *E. coli* ACP as the protein cofactor. Recently the role of ACP structure in the activity of desaturases and fatty acid synthases has been re-emphasized [23,24]. Therefore, in the present work the kinetics and substrate specificity of FatAs and FatBs cloned from *A. thaliana* and *C. sativum* have been re-evaluated with plant ACP. In addition, these studies have extended the range of substrates examined to ACP derivatives of the shorter chain monoenes 16:1<sup>Δ9</sup> and 14:1<sup>Δ9</sup>. Finally, preliminary information on the regions responsible for substrate specificity was determined by shuffling domains between the previously characterized Arabidopsis FatA and FatB.

## Experimental

### Preparation of acyl-ACP substrates. Labeled acyl-ACP substrates were prepared using a recombinant acyl-ACP synthetase from *E. coli* kindly provided by John Shanklin (Brookhaven National Laboratory). Acylation reactions contained 50 μg of recombinant ACP-I from spinach, 660 Mbeq (approximately 0.1 μmol) of [1-<sup>14</sup>C] fatty acid ammonium salt ([<sup>3</sup>H] fatty acid in the case of 16:1<sup>Δ9</sup>), 5 mM ATP, 2 mM DTT, 4 mM LiCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 100 mM Tris pH 8.0, and 10 μg acyl-ACP synthetase in a final volume of 0.5 ml. Reactions were carried out at room temperature for 3–4 h and acyl-ACPs were purified and concentrated by ion-exchange chromatography on DE-52 as described by Rock and Garwin [25].

### Preparation of radioactive myristoleic acid. The fatty acid [1-<sup>14</sup>C] 14:1<sup>Δ9</sup> was prepared from [1-<sup>14</sup>C]14:0-ACP using a recombinant Δ9 14:0-ACP desaturase from
geranium [17]. The reaction medium contained 33 mM PIPES pH 6.0, 1.25 mM NADPH, 3.3 mM ascorbate, 0.7 mM DTT, 8000 U catalase, 40 μg BSA, 20 μg spinach ferredoxin, 640 mU maize root ferredoxin: NADP oxidoreductase, 120 MB eq [1-14C] 14:0-ACP, and 150 μg recombinant desaturase in a final volume of 1.2 ml. This mixture was incubated at room temperature for 6 h, which yielded greater than 90% of 14:1 product. The reaction mixture was saponified for 1 h at 90 °C by addition of 0.8 ml 2.3 M NaOH. The mixture was acidified with 0.35 ml 4 M H₂SO₄ and lipids were extracted three times with 2 ml of hexane. The solvent was evaporated under N₂ and the free fatty acids were methylated for 1 h at 90 °C with 0.5 ml BCl₃-methanol. The methyl esters were extracted and fractionated on an argentation TLC plate using toluene at -20 °C as the mobile phase. The band corresponding to 14:1Δ⁹-methyl ester was scrapped off from the plate and eluted with 2 ml of toluene. The solvent was removed under N₂ and the methyl ester of 14:1Δ⁹ was saponified for 1 h at 90 °C with 0.5 ml of 5% KOH in 90% ethanol. The free 14:1Δ⁹ was then extracted with hexane after acidification with 1 ml H₂SO₄ 1 M and used to prepare the ACP derivative as described above.

Acyl-ACP thioesterase constructs. The DNA fragments encoding the mature acyl-ACP thioesterases from *C. sativum* FatA (CsFatA) and *A. thaliana* FatB (AtFatB) were overexpressed in *E. coli* using the vector pET3d [10, 26].

Oligonucleotide primers were designed to PCR amplify the coding region of the mature *A. thaliana* FatA (clone TE 1-7, [10]) sense primer: 5′GCG ATA CCA TGG GTT CTC AGA CGA AGA ACA3′; antisense primer: 5′GGT AGG GTC GAC TTA ACT TGA AGG CTT CTT TCT3′). The resulting PCR product was cloned into pCR2.1 using the Topo TA cloning kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and the recombinant clone was sequenced to verify the absence of PCR errors. The coding region was subcloned from the pCR2.1 construct into pET28b (Novagen, Madison, WI) using NcoI/BamHI sites.

Protein preparations. BL21(DE3)plyS (Novagen, Madison, WI) was transformed with the acyl-ACP thioesterase expression constructs described above. LB cultures supplemented with appropriate antibiotics were inoculated with 0.1 ml of overnight culture and grown at 37 °C, 250 rpm to OD 600 of 0.6. Protein induction was achieved by addition of isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside to 1 mM final followed by 2 h of growth. To overcome FatB thioesterase enzyme toxicity to *E. coli*, pET3d-AtFatB was grown in 2YT 0.4% glucose with an incubation temperature of 30 °C and induced with 0.15 mM of isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside. After protein induction cells were harvested by centrifugation for 5 min at 4000 g and resuspended in 1.5 ml of 25 mM Tris pH 8.0, 1 mM PMSF, 1 mM DTT (cell resuspension buffer). After washing and centrifugation again, the resulting cell pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of cell resuspension buffer and adjusted to contain 1 mM of MgCl₂, and CaCl₂ 10 U DNase I. Cells were frozen by immersion in liquid N₂ and then thawed at room temperature. The resulting lysed cell suspension was centrifuged at 13,000 g for 10 min in a microcentrifuge. The supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube and subsequently assayed for thioesterase activity.

Extracts from either spinach or *A. thaliana* were produced by grinding 0.5 g of developing leaves in 2.5 ml of 25 mM Tris pH 8.0, 5 mM DTT on ice. The resulting homogenate was filtered through two layers of Miracloth tissue and centrifuged for 15 min at 25,000 g at 4 °C. The supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube and subsequently assayed for thioesterase activity.

For kinetic analysis studies the soluble protein preparations of AtFatA and AtFatB (see above) were purified by ion-exchange chromatography on DE-52. *E. coli* extracts were loaded onto a 5 ml ion-exchange column previously equilibrated with 20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 5 mM DTT (wash buffer). After washing with five column volumes of the wash buffer, a 100 ml NaCl gradient (from 0 to 0.3 M in wash buffer) was applied to the column. Fractions (2.5 ml) were collected from the column and assayed for acyl-ACP thioesterase and protein. The fractions displaying the highest specific activity were pooled, adjusted to 5 mM DTT and stored at -70 °C. Protein was determined by the colorimetric method of Bradford [27] using γ-globulin as the standard.

Production of chimeric acyl-ACP thioesterases. Recombinant proteins with the N-terminus of FatA and C-terminus of FatB (FatAB) or the N-terminus of FatB and the C-terminus of FatA (FatBA) were created by a PCR approach (Fig. 1). The C-terminal portion of *A. thaliana* FatA or FatB was amplified by PCR with the addition of a HindIII (FatB; sense primer: 5′GCA AGC TTG AAG TTA ACA AAA ATT GAT GAC3′, antisense primer: 5′ATC TCG AGA AGG TGG TAG TAG CAG ATA TAG TT3′) or an EcoRI restriction site (FatA; sense primer: 5′CGG AAT TCT CCG GAA GAG AAT ACC AGA3′ antisense primer: 5′ATG TCG ACT TAA CTT GAA GGC TTC TTT CTC CAC AG3′). The FatB C-terminal fragment (encoding Lys²⁸⁹ to the stop codon) was subcloned into pET28b-FatA using HindIII and the XhoI restriction sites. In the same way, the C-terminal FatA fragment (encoding Phe²²⁹ to the stop codon) was subcloned into pET28b-FatB using EcoRI and the SalI restriction sites. The resulting hybrids were designated FatAB or FatBA, respectively (Fig. 1).

Three additional chimeric proteins were constructed by swapping different regions of the N-terminal domains of AtFatA and AtFatB (R1, R2, and R3 in Fig. 1) using a modified version of the overlap extension PCR method described by Horton et al. [28]. The chimeric

PCR products were cloned into the NcolI/SacI site of pET28b. All chimeric constructs were sequenced to verify the absence of PCR errors before overexpression in BL21(DE3)plyS.

**Acyl-ACP Thioesterase assays.** Thioesterase activity was assayed in 0.1 ml reactions containing 25 mM Tris pH 8.0, 1 mM DTT, 0.8 μmol labeled acyl-ACP substrate (170 MBeq approx.), and 0.2–12 μg of protein preparation. Reactions were carried out at room temperature and stopped by addition of 0.1 ml 1 M acetic acid in 2-propanol. Unsterified fatty acids were then extracted twice with 0.4 ml hexane, pooled and radioactivity determined by liquid scintillation.

**Expression and quantification of acyl-ACP thioesterases in E. coli extracts.** Cultures of BL21 (DE3) plySE. coli transformed with thioesterase constructs were grown as described in the protein preparation section. After the OD600 reached 0.6 they were induced by addition of 1 mM isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside. Aliquots of 1 ml of culture were taken at 0, 15, 30, 60, and 120 min after the induction. Cells were then harvested by centrifugation at 5000 g for 5 min and lysed with 0.1 ml of 25 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 1 M DTT, 1% SDS. The total lysates were fractionated on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes and immunostained using either previously raised [10, 26] antiCsFatA or antiAtFatB antiseraums (1:1000) as described by Post-Beittenmiller et al. [29].

Crude protein extracts prepared as described in the protein preparation section were fractionated on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels together with extracts prepared in a similar way from BL21(DE3)plyS E. coli transformed with the empty plasmids. Gels were stained with 0.2% Coomassie R-250 in 40% methanol, 10% acetic acid by heating for 45 s in a microwave oven and then destained overnight in 25% methanol, 9% acetic acid. Stained gels were desiccated for two days in G101 gel wrap (BioDesign, Carmel, NY). A simultaneous preparation of the enzyme extracts was blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes after fractionation on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and immunostained with antiCsFatA or antiAtFatB antiserum as described above. The bands identified as the expressed thioesterases were quantified in the desiccated gels by densitometry using a digital camera.

**Results and discussion**

Although the substrate specificity of plant acyl-ACP thioesterases has previously been examined from several species [30], most of such studies had one or more limitations. First, analysis of plant extracts can be complicated by the presence of both FatA and FatB activities or by multiple isoforms of each enzyme. Second, because of limited quantities of available radiolabeled acyl-ACP substrates, very few studies have included kinetic analysis. Third, the number of substrates tested has been generally limited to those readily available and has not included cis-914:1 or cis-916:1. Fourth, almost every study so far reported on thioesterase specificity used E. coli ACP rather than plant ACP to determine substrate specificity. However, previous work indicated that enzymes involved in de novo fatty acid biosynthesis are influenced by the ACP form supplied in their acyl-ACP substrates [23, 24, 31]. In the present study we sought to address each of the above issues through more detailed analysis of cloned FatA and FatB enzymes to assure that only one acyl-ACP thioesterase is considered, by using plant ACP and by extending the range of substrates analyzed.

A more detailed analysis of FatA and FatB substrate specificities was also sought to help explain the origin of palmitic acid in plants. Almost all plant tissues of all higher plant species contain at least 10–20% palmitic acid. Although in chloroplasts, acyl-ACP acyltransferases can contribute to palmitic content of plastid lipids, in non-photosynthetic tissues this pathway is minor.

Therefore, acyl-ACP thioesterases are believed to be responsible for most palmitic acids but the relative contribution of FatA and FatB is unclear [11]. Thus, kinetic analysis of FatA and FatB specificity may help toward understanding the possible contribution of each enzyme to palmitate metabolism.

Substrate specificities of *Arabidopsis thaliana* and *Coriandrum sativum* FatAs. Cloned FatA thioesterases from Arabidopsis and coriander have previously been characterized in this lab [10, 26]. The activity of CsFatA was tested with a series of 18:1 isomers, but activity with acyl-ACP of different chain lengths and desaturations was not tested. We have expanded these studies to include the common intermediates of the fatty acid synthesis 14:0-ACP, 16:0-ACP, 18:0-ACP, and 18:1Δ9-ACP as well as for the more unusual 16:1Δ9 and 14:1Δ9-ACPs in order to better define their substrate specificity. The fatty acid 16:1Δ9 is found in small amounts in the lipid fraction of most plants, being produced by the action of the 18:0Δ9-ACP desaturase on the substrate 16:0-ACP or by 16:0-ACP specific acyl-ACP desaturases. It is also a major component of the oil of several seeds including Cat's claw [16]. The 14:1Δ9 fatty acid is much more unusual, being produced by a 14:0Δ9-ACP desaturase present, among other sources, in the geranium trichomes [17]. Both of these unusual fatty acids are compounds of interest in oleochemistry due to their stability and low melting points, which make them a suitable feedstock for the preparation of biodegradable lubricants and other products. To date, the only report pertaining to thioesterase activity with shorter chain monoenoic fatty acid is a limited study of castor oilseed endosperm crude extract which reported an activity for 16:1Δ9-ACP that was 50% of that with 18:1Δ9-ACP [19]. Our initial approach to characterization of these enzymes involved measurement of the thioesterase activities present in *E. coli* extracts using a constant concentration of each substrate. As shown in Fig. 2A, AtFatA displayed very high thioesterase activity towards 18:1Δ9-ACP. The activity found for other substrates was strongly dependent on both the chain length and presence of a Δ9 double bond in the acyl moiety of the acyl-ACP substrates. Likewise, the relative specificity profile of the coriander CsFatA (Fig. 2B) was similar to that of the Arabidopsis AtFatA.

For both AtFatA and CsFatA, activities found were always several fold higher for the monoenes than for their saturated precursors, regardless of the chain length. Thus, the enzymes displayed similar activities towards 18:0-ACP and 16:1Δ9-ACP but were much lower towards 16:0-ACP or C14 ACP derivatives. Furthermore, activities towards 16:1Δ9-ACP were of the same order or higher than for the immediate longer chain saturated substrate, 18:0-ACP. These profiles are similar to those previously reported for FatAs from other sources such as *G. mangostana* [5] or safflower [6]

Activity was measured in extracts from *E. coli*. The hydrolytic background of the extracts is represented by the black bars. The numbers beside the bars indicate the corresponding activity value.

although no shorter chained Δ9 unsaturated substrates 16:1Δ9- or 14:1Δ9-ACP were analyzed in these studies. The similarity in specificity profiles is in good agreement with the high sequence similarity found between AtFatA and CsFatA (66.5% identity) and supports the hypothesis that a high rate of 18:1Δ9 export from the plastid is essential for most plant cells.

Substrate specificity of Arabidopsis thaliana FatB. ACP structure influences thioesterase specificity. Doermann et al. [10] previously examined the specificity of *A. thaliana* FatB. However, monoenoic acyl-ACP derivatives were not assayed and *E. coli* ACP was used. As shown in Fig. 2C, we have extended the activity profile for AtFatB to include 16:1Δ9 and 14:1Δ9 and used spinach ACP rather than *E. coli* ACP. The AtFatB enzyme displayed the highest activity towards 16:0-ACP but also displayed significant activity with 18:1Δ9-ACP, which was 75% relative to 16:0-ACP. Lower activities were measured for 18:0-ACP and 16:1Δ9-ACP, and lowest hydrolysis rates occurred with 14:1Δ9-ACP and 14:0-ACP. The AtFatB specificity pattern was similar to the profiles of *G. mangostana* [5] and *Cuphea hookeriana* [4] FatB1s as well as a FatB recently cloned from oil palm [32], which displayed high activity towards 16:0-ACP, although they differed in the relatively lower activity level for 18:1Δ9-ACP. Moreover, the differences found in the activity towards 16:0-ACP between AtFatA and AtFatB may suggest that most 16:0 present in the tissues of this plant is exported from the plastids via FatB. This hypothesis is supported by the changes observed in the concentration of that fatty acid when the latter thioesterase was either overexpressed or repressed in different tissues of the plant [11]. This observation could be of importance for the future manipulation of lipid composition in different oil crops.

A major difference between the FatB data in Fig. 2C compared to results of Doermann et al. [10] occurred in the activity towards 14:0-ACP. Methodologically, the main difference in the two studies was the use of *E. coli* ACP instead of the spinach ACP-I used in the present work. Previous works indicate that the ACP moiety can exert strong influence on several enzymes involved in acyl-ACP reactions. Thus, Schütt et al. [24] demonstrated that the metabolic flux to medium chain fatty acids in *Cuphea lanceolata* was increased by the use of isoform ACP-2 instead of ACP-1 isolated from that source. Activity of the unusual acyl-ACP desaturases expressed by coriander and *Thumbergia alata* endosperm increased several fold when specific ACP isoforms were used [23]. In the case of acyl-ACP thioesterases, Guerra et al. [31], reported a 100% increase of the oleoyl-ACP thioesterase activity displayed by spinach leaf extracts with *E. coli* ACP instead of spinach ACP-1. To further examine the role of the ACP structure on AtFatB specificity this enzyme was assayed with a series of acyl-ACP substrates prepared with ACP from either microbial (*E. coli*) or plant origin. As shown in Fig. 3 AtFatB displayed similar activity towards 16:0, 18:0, and 18:1Δ9 acyl-ACPs when they were prepared with the *E. coli* ACP protein. Activity towards 14:0-ACP was about 3-fold lower than for 16:0-ACP, reproducing the results reported by Doermann et al. [10]. When these activities were compared with those found for substrates

Fig. 3. Effect of the origin of the ACP on the FatB activity. AtFatB expressed in *E. coli* was assayed using acyl-ACPs prepared either from spinach (grey bars) or *E. coli* (black bars) ACP.

prepared with spinach ACP-I important differences were observed for the 14:0-ACP and 16:0-ACP derivatives. Thus, activity towards 14:0-ACP (*E. coli*) was about 3-fold higher than for the homologous substrate prepared with spinach ACP, whereas the opposite effect was found for the 16:0-ACP substrates (Fig. 3). Thus, the 16:0-ACP/14:0-ACP activity ratio was 6-fold higher with spinach ACP, which implied that AtFatB was more efficient for the export of palmitate when that cofactor was used. These results support the hypothesis of a major role of this enzyme in the metabolism of palmitate in plant tissue as well as explain the different results obtained in *E. coli* and Arabidopsis when AtFatB was overexpressed. Thus, the overexpression of this thioesterase in *E. coli* leads to a substantial increase of 14:0 in the bacterial free fatty acid pool [10], whereas only very minor accumulation of that fatty acid was observed when overexpression was carried out in *A. thaliana* [11].

Turnovers of acyl-ACP thioesterases. By quantification of the thioesterases expressed in bacterial extracts a comparison could be made of their activities on a molar basis (Table 1). Expression of the thioesterase proteins in *E. coli* was assessed by scanning densitometry and immunoblotting after SDS-PAGE of total cell lysates taken at different times before and after induction. The synthesis of a protein of the expected molecular weight (35–40 kDa) that reacted strongly with either antiC-sFatA or antiAtFatB antiserum was observed in induced but not in uninduced or vector only controls. Furthermore, when Coomassie-stained protein gels were examined, bands matching the antibody positive signals with the expected molecular weight were found to be

ACP. In the same table the turnover ratios of these enzymes for 18:1$^\Delta9$- and 16:1$^\Delta9$-ACP substrates compared with their saturated precursors are also shown. In this regard, although both thioesterases presented similar specificity patterns the 16:1$^\Delta9$-ACP/16:0-ACP turnover ratio was about double in the coriander FatA form.

Kinetic studies on AtFatA and AtFatB. Although data on substrate specificity have been published for several different acyl-ACP thioesterase forms, in most studies kinetic parameters were not determined for different substrates. Kinetic characterization of AtFatA and AtFatB for acyl-ACPs of different lengths and unsaturations can provide evidence about the interaction of those enzymes with their substrates. The studies of kinetics were carried out with fractions partially purified by ion-exchange chromatography. The AtFatB and AtFatA present in the purified fractions were quantified as described in the Experimental section, and accounted for 3.7% and 12%, respectively, of the total protein in the assay. As shown in Table 2, both AtFatA and AtFatB displayed similar Km values, in the micromolar order, for the assayed substrates. Therefore, the major differences in specificity presented in Fig. 2 result from the kcat values for each acyl-ACP rather than from Km. Thus, taking into consideration that the standard deviations resulting from three independent determinations of the Km values ranged from 15% to 40%, only in the case of the Cl4ACP substrates assayed with AtFatA was there a significant increase of Km concomitant with the decrease of kcat values. These data indicate that the specificity of the acyl-ACP thioesterases is mainly dependent on the differences of enthalpy of activation ($\Delta H^*$) of the reactions associated with each substrate. Assuming that the increment of entropy in all these reactions is essentially equal, the differences in $\Delta H^*$ can be calculated from data in Table 2. Thus, both the removal of the $\Delta 9$ bond and a 2C $n$-terminal shortening of the acyl moiety of the 18:1$^\Delta9$-ACP substrate corresponded to an increment of $\Delta H^*$ of approximately 6 kJ/mol in the reactions catalyzed by AtFatA. This difference was around 3 kJ/mol for the transitions 18:0-ACP/16:0-ACP, and 16:0-ACP/14:0-ACP.

The recombinant enzymes were partially purified by ion-exchange chromatography.
The differences of $\Delta H^{*}$ found for the substrates studied with AtFatB were in the same range as those found for AtFatA although they did not follow any clear tendency. The catalytic efficiencies (kcat/Km) were similar in both enzymes for the preferred substrates 18:1$\Delta^{9}$-ACP and 16:0-ACP, but dropped abruptly for different substrates in the case of AtFatA, whereas for AtFatB they stayed in the high range for all substrates except for 14:1$\Delta^{9}$-ACP. We also compared the kinetic constants obtained for the *E. coli* expressed recombinant enzymes for the substrate 18:1$\Delta^{9}$-ACP with those found in extracts from developing spinach and *A. thaliana* leaves. The Km values found for 18:1$\Delta^{9}$-ACP were similar in leaf tissue of both species (ca. 1.5 μM) and were 50% lower than the values for the *E. coli* expressed enzymes (Table 2). Possible explanations for this difference are that a different folding pattern of the protein may occur when synthesized in bacteria or it may be possible that the enzyme structure is stabilized by interactions with other proteins in the plant extract. The plant extracts were also assayed using 16:0-ACP but the activity was too low for reliable kinetic analysis. The Km values found for both AtFatA and AtFatB were similar to those reported for FatA or FatB purified from *C. lanceolata* endosperm (Km values between 1.3 and 30 μM were reported for a collection of substrates ranging from 8:0 to 18:1$\Delta^{9}$-ACP [33] and for those found in recombinant FatBl1s from and *U. californica* and *Cinammon camphora* [22]. Data have not been published previously regarding kcat or catalytic efficiencies of acyl-ACP thioesterases. However, Lee et al. [34] reported that palmitoyl-CoA hydrolase from *E. coli* displayed catalytic efficiencies around 0.4 s$^{-1}$/μM which are similar to those reported in the present paper for AtFatA and AtFatB.

### Substrate specificity of chimeric thioesterases.
The knowledge of the amino acid regions or residues determining substrate specificity of plant acyl-ACP thioesterases could provide information useful for engineering new thioesterase structures with desired substrate specificities. Such enzymes may be useful to increase the yield of specialty fatty acids in commercial seed oils. Previous work on acyl-ACP thioesterase engineering demonstrated that two amino acid changes converted the specificity of a thioesterase from 12:0-ACP to 14:0-ACP [20]. Furthermore, by comparing the sequences of different FatAs to the FatA1 from *G. mangostana* it was possible to find residues responsible for the high 18:0-ACP activity phenotype of that enzyme. Further directed mutagenesis on this residue resulted in a 13-fold increase in the specific activity of the enzyme towards 18:0-ACP, and when expressed in transgenic *Brassica napus* a high stearate phenotype was observed by Facciotti et al. [21].

However, the general question of what determines the different substrate profiles of FatA or FatB has not yet

been addressed. In this regard Facciotti and Yuan [22] employed a domain-swapping strategy using *U. californica* FatB1 and *G. mangostana* FatA1, focusing mainly on the C-terminal end where the catalytic amino acids are localized [35]. However, most of the changes resulted in inactive proteins or enzymes retaining an unaltered phenotype. In the present work, we used a similar approach to find the domains responsible for the specificity profiles of AtFatA and AtFatB. In our study, no assumptions were made regarding the active site of the enzymes and the site chosen to accomplish the domain-swap was determined by the presence of restriction sites that allowed convenient domain exchange (Fig. 1). The two primary recombinant thioesterases were called FatAB and FatBA. In the first case the enzyme carried the N-terminal end of AtFatA and the C-terminal end of AtFatB. The chimeric enzymes FatAB and FatBA were expressed in *E. coli* and their substrate specificities studied in the resulting protein extracts. Both proteins were found to be active as acyl-ACP thioesterases, as shown in Fig. 4. FatAB displayed FatA-like phenotype

Fig. 4. Substrate specificity of the chimeric enzymes FatAB (A) and FatBA (B) for several acyl-ACP substrates. Activity was measured in extracts from *E. coli*. The hydrolytic background of the extracts is represented by the black bars. The numbers beside the bars indicate the corresponding activity value.with a specificity profile almost identical to that found for AtFatA. In this regard the turnover ratios 18:1<sup>Δ9</sup>-ACP/18:0 and 16:1<sup>Δ9</sup>-ACP/18:0-ACP stayed almost unaltered if compared with the native AtFatA (Table 1). However, the swapping of the C-terminal domain for that from AtFatB resulted in a substantial decrease of the turnover of the chimeric enzyme to about 5-fold less active than native AtFatA. A second chimera, FatBA, a fusion of the AtFatA C-domain to AtFatB was also active, and displayed an activity profile with high specificity towards 16:0 and 18:1<sup>Δ9</sup>-ACP similar to that of native AtFatB. However, again the construct showed a major drop of the turnover value to about 10-fold lower in the chimeric form than in the native AtFatB. These results taken together indicate that the specificity of the acyl-ACP thioesterases is determined by their N-terminal domain and that the C-terminal end of these enzymes, although it carries the catalytic amino acids, has a comparatively small contribution to that parameter. These results differ from the hypothesis of Facciotti and Yuan [22] that substrate specificity depends on the C-terminal domain. We also attempted a further domain-swapping on the N-terminal end of these enzymes to clarify regions involved in substrate recognition. Three additional constructs carrying different amino acid domains present in that region from AtFatA and AtFAAtB were made using overlapping extension PCR (Fig. 1). Although the expression of the proteins was confirmed by immunoblots none of these chimeras retained measurable thioesterase activity, indicating that the regions manipulated are important for these enzymes to be active. In summary, the domain-swapping approach provided new information about the different regions of FatA and FatB acyl-ACP thioesterases involved in substrate recognition, although the production of biotechnologically useful constructs may be limited by the decrease of the turnover of the resulting chimeras.

In summary, acyl-ACP thioesterases are enzymes of great interest due to their ability to change the fatty acid composition of seed glycerolipids. Thus this class of enzymes has become the object of intensive research for the production of speciality oils. The first part of the present study defined more extensively the characterization of the activity of existing FatA and FatB thioesterases towards the most common acyl-ACPs in plant plastids and additionally tested two unusual chain length Δ9 monoenes (16:1<sup>Δ9</sup> and 14:1<sup>Δ9</sup>). Furthermore, the amino acid domains involved in thioesterase substrate specificity were defined. These results represent a first approach to the objective of the production of thioesterases of defined specificity for new substrates. Crystallographic data for these enzymes as well as the sequences of thioesterases specific for unusual monoenes will provide valuable information to this field. Additionally, comparative structure-function analysis or directed evolution of these enzymes, paying special

attention to the N-terminal domain, will be necessary for the identification of the aspects determining the phenotype of the different acyl-ACP thioesterases.
