**Abstract**  
Since its discovery two decades ago, the activation of the Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway by numerous cytokines and growth factors has resulted in it becoming one of the most well-studied intracellular signalling networks. The field has progressed from the identification of the individual components to high-resolution crystal structures of both JAK and STAT, and an understanding of the complexities of the molecular activation and deactivation cycle which results in a diverse, yet highly specific and regulated pattern of transcriptional responses. While there is still more to learn, we now appreciate how disruption and deregulation of this pathway can result in clinical disease and look forward to adoption of the next generation of JAK inhibitors in routine clinical treatment.

**The canonical JAK/STAT pathway**  
No longer ‘Just another kinase’, the Janus kinase (JAK) protein tyrosine kinases are now recognised as an integral component of the cytokine receptor subunits, and enzyme activation, as the initiating step in a signalling cascade required for embryonic development, tissue growth, haemopoietic development and differentiation, innate and adaptive immunity and the inflammatory response. Upon ligand binding to the cognate transmembrane receptors, two or more receptor-associated JAKs are brought into close proximity through receptor oligomerisation to allow auto-phosphorylation and/or trans-phosphorylation by the opposing JAK kinase. Once activated, JAKs then phosphorylate signature tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic region of the receptors to create docking sites for members of the signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) family, so named for their dual ability to function as cytoplasmic signalling modules and transcription factors (Darnell et al. 1994). Upon binding to the receptor through their Src homology 2 (SH2) domain, the STATs themselves become a JAK substrate. Phosphorylation of the conserved tyrosine residue located between the SH2 domain and the C-terminal transactivation domain (TAD) results in the formation of parallel STAT dimers, which are stabilised by reciprocal phosphotyrosine and SH2 domain interactions (Shuai et al. 1994; Meyer et al. 2004). Dimer formation is followed by translocation to the nucleus (Kessler et al. 1990; Shuai et al. 1993; Sekimoto et al. 1997; Fagerlund et al. 2002; Kawashima et al. 2006, 2009) where the STAT dimers bind to specific palindromic sequences within the promoter regions of target genes to initiate the appropriate transcriptional response (Schindler and Darnell 1995; Ihle 1996).

decades. There are four members of the mammalian JAK family, JAK1–3 and tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2). JAK1 and JAK2 were discovered using a degenerate polymerase chain reaction (PCR) screen based on conserved residues in the catalytic units of known protein tyrosine kinases (Wilks 1989; Wilks et al. 1991; Harpur et al. 1992). TYK2 was identified by homology screening to the c-fms kinase domain (Firmbach-Kraft et al. 1990) and JAK3 was discovered shortly thereafter (Witthuhn et al. 1994; Rane and Reddy 1994; Cance and Liu 1995). As their significance became apparent, the acronym transitioned from being ‘just another kinase’ to ‘Janus’ kinase, after the two-faced Roman god Janus (Encyclopedia Britannica 1989), and in reflection of the characteristic tandem kinase domains.

The intimate connection between JAK and the cytokine receptors was first revealed by an elegant series of experiments by Ian Kerr, George Stark, Sandra Pellegrini and colleagues. The somatic cell genetic screen resulted in six different complementation groups (U1–U6), which were unresponsive to interferon (IFN) α (Pellegrini et al. 1989; John et al. 1991; Darnell et al. 1994; McKendry et al. 1994). U2–U6 were also unresponsive to IFNβ and U2–U4 were unresponsive to IFNγ, strongly suggesting that the complementation groups were deficient in components both unique to and shared between the different ligand responses. Indeed, genetic studies revealed that U1A cells were deficient in TYK2, whereas the U4–U6 cells were eventually found to be deficient in other components of the IFNβ and IFNγ JAK-STAT signalling cascades (Velazquez et al. 1992; Muller et al. 1993a,b; Darnell et al. 1994). An analogous screen selecting for cells that were only unresponsive to IFNγ identified a mutant cell line (γ1A) that could be complemented by JAK2 (Watling et al. 1993). These experiments also defined the pathway hierarchy, as expression of JAK1 in U4A cells restored phosphorylation of STAT1 (Muller et al. 1993a), and conceptually suggested that the JAKs may be utilised by other cytokine receptors. Subsequently, JAK3 was shown to interact with the IL-2 receptor (IL-2R) common gamma chain (γc) in a region commonly mutated in patients suffering from severe combined immunodeficiency disease (SCID) (Russell et al. 1994).

The STATs were originally characterised as components of the IFNα/β and IFNγ transcriptional response (Levy et al. 1988, 1989) and this early data preceded the genetic complementation studies. STAT1 and STAT2 (together with IRF9) were found to form a three-protein transcription complex (interferon-stimulated gene factor-3, ISGF3), which bound to common promoter elements within IFNα-responsive genes (interferon-stimulated response element, ISRE) (Fu et al. 1990; Kessler et al. 1990; Fu et al. 1992; Schindler et al. 1992a; Veals et al.

1992). Similarly, STAT1 complexes were found to bind promoter elements within IFNγ-responsive genes (IFNγ activation site, GAS) (Schindler et al. 1992b; Shuai et al. 1992).

Numerous papers followed, identifying a bewildering array of JAKs and STATs that were activated in response to different cytokines/growth factors. The definitive papers utilised gene targeting to demonstrate a layer of specificity, which, until that point, had not been fully appreciated.

Studies on non-mammalian species have also made important contributions to our understanding of JAK-STAT biology and its significance, for instance see Hombria and Brown (2002), Hou et al. (2002), Brown and Zeidler (2008). Due to space constraints, this review is limited to mammalian studies.

### Non-redundant biological roles of JAK

JAK1 knockout mice die shortly after birth and analysis of JAK1-deficient cells revealed a requirement for JAK1 in signalling via the class II receptors (IFNα/β, IFNγ, IL-10), those cytokines which signal through the γc receptor (IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-15 and IL-21) and those that utilise gp130 (Rodig et al. 1998). JAK2-deficient mice were embryonic lethal due to a lack of definitive erythropoiesis, and analysis of JAK2-deficient cells revealed non-redundant roles for JAK2 in regulating thrombopoietin (TPO), IL-3, granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and IFNγ (Neubauer et al. 1998; Parganas et al. 1998). While the majority of JAKs are ubiquitously expressed (Kawamura et al. 1994; Musso et al. 1995; Tortolani et al. 1995), JAK3 expression is restricted to the haemopoietic lineages and vascular muscle cells (Musso et al. 1995; Gurniak and Berg 1996; Verbsky et al. 1996). Gene targeting in the mouse confirmed a critical role for JAK3 in lymphocyte development and function, mediated through cytokines that share the IL-2R γc chain (Nosaka et al. 1995; Thomis et al. 1995), and this was paralleled by human studies, which identified a JAK3 mutation in a patient with SCID (Russell et al. 1995). In contrast, deletion of the Tyk2 gene revealed a slightly different picture to that suggested by the genetic complementation experiments, with Tyk2-deficient mice displaying only a modest reduction in signalling capacity in response to IFNα. Responses to IL-12, however, were severely impaired (Shimoda et al. 2000).

### Non-redundant biological roles of STAT

There are seven STATs in mammalian cells, STAT1–4, 5a, 5b and 6 (Fu et al. 1992; Schindler et al. 1992a; Hou et al. 1994; Yamamoto et al. 1994; Zhong et al. 1994b; Mui et al. 1995; Wakao et al. 1995). STAT5a and STAT5b are closely related and result from a
gene duplication event (Liu et al. 1995), while splice
variants of STAT1, 3, 4 and 5 have been reported,
which result in a truncated C-terminus (Darnell
et al. 1994; Wang et al. 1996; Levy and Darnell 2002;
Hoey et al. 2003). STAT1 is widely expressed, with
high levels in heart, thymus and spleen, STAT4 is
found mainly in testis, thymus and spleen (Zhong
et al. 1994a; Herrada and Wolgemuth 1997), while
STAT5a and 5b exhibit differential expression in
muscle, brain, mammary gland and secretory organs
(seminal vesicles and salivary gland) (Liu et al. 1995).
STAT2, STAT3 and STAT6 are expressed in the
majority of tissues (Hou et al. 1994; Zhong et al.
1994a; Zhang et al. 1997).

Stat1-deficient mice display deficiencies in immune
responses mediated by IFNα and IFNγ and are highly
susceptible to infection with *Listeria monocytogenes*
and vesicular stomatitis virus (Durbin et al. 1996;
Meraz et al. 1996). The complete lack of responsiveness
to interferon confirmed the earlier studies, which
had predicted a critical role for Stat1 in interferon
signalling. Similarly, Stat2-knockout mice are also
sensitive to viral infection, with analysis of Stat2-
deficient mice and cells confirming a critical role in
regulating signalling by the type I interferons (Park
et al. 2000).

In contrast, Stat3-deficient mice were embryonic
lethal (E6.5–7.5), most likely due to a failure to
form visceral endoderm (Takeda et al. 1997). Conditional
deletion of Stat3 in adult mouse tissues
has demonstrated the importance of Stat3 for a wide
range of physiological processes, with defects found in
lung (Hokuto et al. 2004), bone (Zhang et al. 2005),
colon (Welte et al. 2003), heart (Hilfiker-Kleiner et al.

2005), the nervous system (Okada et al. 2006)
and skin (Sano et al. 1999), and are consistent with
Stat3-inducing biological responses for a large
variety of cytokines, including the IL-6/gp130 family
(Akira et al. 1994; Nakajima et al. 1996; Takeda et al.
1998; Gao et al. 2004; Owaki et al. 2008), IL-10
(Takeda et al. 1999; Blumberg et al. 2001), SG-CSF
(Shimozaki et al. 1997), leptin (Bates et al. 2003) and
IL-21 (Zhou et al. 2007; Avery et al. 2010). Stat4-
deficient mice fail to respond to IL-12 and IL-23
(which shares the IL-12Rβ1), resulting in reduced
Th1 differentiation and natural killer (NK) cell
function (Kaplan et al. 1996; Thierfelder et al. 1996).
Stat5a and Stat5b are required to elicit biological
responses to IL-3, GM-CSF (Feldman et al. 1997;
Teglund et al. 1998; Ilaria et al. 1999), γc cytokines
(Imada et al. 1998; Moriggl et al. 1999a,b), growth
hormone and prolactin (Liu et al. 1997; Udy et al.
1997; Teglund et al. 1998; Ilaria et al. 1999). Stat5a/Stat5b double-deficient mice have impaired
mammary gland development and growth retardation,
consistent with the roles of STAT5a and STAT5b in
mediating prolactin and growth hormone responses,
respectively (Boghaert et al. 1997; Udy et al. 1997;
Teglund et al. 1998; Cui et al. 2004). Mice lacking
both Stat5a and b are severely anaemic and the
majority die perinatally (Gui et al. 2004), with an
earlier study suggesting reduced erythropoiesis and
increased cell death due to reduced (erythropoietin)
EPO-STAT5 driven Bcl-XL expression (Socolovsky
et al. 1999). Most recently, STAT5 has been found to
play additional roles in haemopoietic cell develop-
ment, differentiation and survival (Kieslinger et al.
2000; Yao et al. 2006; Wang et al. 2009). Stat6-

deficient mice are refractory to IL-4 and IL-13 and as a consequence have defective Th2 polarisation, IgG1 and IgE class switching, and greater susceptibility to parasite infection (Shimoda et al. 1996; Takeda et al. 1996a,b; Urban et al. 1998).

The requirement for individual JAK and Stat molecules is summarised in Figure 1.

### Domain architecture and mechanism of action

#### JAK protein tyrosine kinases

Sequence alignment identified seven JAK homology (JH) regions (Harpur et al. 1992) starting with a tyrosine kinase domain (JH1) at the carboxyl (C)-terminus, a pseudokinase domain (Saharinen et al. 2000; Yeh et al. 2000; Saharinen et al. 2003) (JH2), an SH2-like domain (JH3-4) (Bernards 1991; Kampa and Burnside 2000) and finally a divergent four-point-one, ezrin, radixin, moesin (FERM) homology domain (JH4-7) at the amino (N)-terminus (Yamaoka et al. 2004), with JH4 crossing into both the SH2-like and FERM domains (Figure 2). The high-resolution crystal structures of all four active JAK JH1 domains have now been solved and reveal a highly conserved and typical bilobed kinase domain (Lucet et al. 2006; Williams et al. 2009; Chrencik et al. 2010).

Until recently, the pseudokinase domain has been believed to be catalytically inactive as it lacked the key amino acids required for enzyme function, and instead had an autoinhibitory role, with deletion or mutation of the domain resulting in enhanced JAK2 and JAK3 kinase activity (Saharinen et al. 2000, 2003; Saharinen and Silvennoinen 2002). While it was known for some time that phosphorylation within the pseudokinase domain was required for inhibition (Feener et al. 2004; Argetsinger et al. 2004; Ishida-Takahashi et al. 2006), it now appears that the domain is a dual specificity kinase and that autophosphorylation of Ser523 and Tyr570 is required to maintain the inactive kinase in its basal state (Ungureanu et al. 2011). This result implies that a key step in the activation of the JAKs might be de-phosphorylation of Ser523, and the identification of the phosphatase/s responsible will be an intriguing piece of the puzzle. Understanding exactly how the pseudokinase domain mediates its inhibitory function will require the 3D structure of the JH2:JH1 complex. The biological significance of this domain is underscored by the acquired mutations found in human myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs; discussed in more detail below), which are predicted to mitigate its autoinhibitory function and which include point mutation of valine 617.

The SH2-like domain has many of the structural and sequence-related hallmarks of a classic SH2 module, yet lacks some of the key residues normally conserved within the SH2 domain family, with

experimental mutation of the critical arginine further suggesting that an ability to bind phosphotyrosine is not required for its function (Kohlhuber et al. 1997). Instead, the SH2-like domain is likely to have a structural role and is, for instance, required for JAK1 binding to the oncostatin M receptor (OSM-R) (Radtke et al. 2005) and for TYK2 to maintain surface expression of IFNAR1 (Richter et al. 1998; Ragimbeau et al. 2003).

FERM domains classically form a three-lobed structure; encompassing a ubiquitin-like fold (F1), an acyl-coenzyme A binding-like fold (F2) and a pleckstrin homology domain fold (F3) (Pearson et al. 2000). The JAK FERM domain mediates binding to the receptor cytoplasmic domains (Girault et al. 1998; Cacalano et al. 1999; Haan et al. 2001) and with the suggestion that the FERM domain also contributes to kinase integrity, may be involved in a more complex structural interplay with other JH domains (Zhou et al. 2001; Haan et al. 2008). The FERM F1 and F2 subdomains (JH6-7) are the minimum requirement for interaction with the membrane-proximal, proline-rich Box 1 region of the receptor cytoplasmic domains (Lebrun et al. 1995; Tanner et al. 1995; Zhao et al. 1995; Richter et al. 1998; Cacalano et al. 1999), although in some instances, other receptor residues such as those within the hydrophobic Box 2 region of the granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSFR) and EPO-R are required for both interaction and full JAK activation (Witthuhn et al. 1993; Barge et al. 1996).

Careful biochemical studies by Claude Haan and colleagues (Giese et al. 2003; Behrmann et al. 2004) would suggest that the JAKs are an integral component of the receptor subunit with very little release or exchange into the cytoplasm and as such are located primarily at the plasma membrane. This relationship may be functionally required even before the receptors reach the cell surface, with data showing that an interaction with the JAK2 FERM domain is required for proper processing of the immature EPO-R in the endoplasmic reticulum and its subsequent surface expression (Huang et al. 2001).

STATs

Each STAT has seven conserved features: an N-terminal (NT) domain, a coiled-coil (CC) domain, a central DNA-binding domain (DBD), a linker region, an SH2 domain followed by a single conserved tyrosine residue and a C-terminal TAD. Prior to cytokine stimulation, non-phosphorylated STATs exist as anti-parallel dimers, formed through reciprocal interactions between the NT domains (Lackmann et al. 1998; Ndubuisi et al. 1999; Braunstein et al. 2003; Ota et al. 2004; Mao et al. 2005), and continuously shuttle between the cytoplasm and nucleus. Upon cytokine stimulation, the STATs are localised to the receptor complex by interaction of the SH2 domain with the receptor phosphotyrosine residues (Table I). JAK phosphorylation of the STAT proteins then results in a spatial reorganisation of the dimer complex, to form an active, parallel dimer stabilised by reciprocal SH2 and phosphotyrosine interactions, which disengages from the receptor and translocates to the nucleus. STAT1, 3, 4, 5 and 6 form homodimeric complexes, while STAT1 and STAT3, at least in vitro, can also form a heterodimeric complex. STAT2 primarily functions as a heterodimer with STAT1 (together with IRF9), but can also act independently of STAT1 (Hahm et al. 2005; Perry et al. 2011).

To enter into the nucleus, STAT dimers need to traverse the nuclear pore complex; a bidirectional transport channel embedded in the nuclear envelope and composed of nucleoporins (Onischenko and Weis 2011; Meyer and Vinkemeier 2004). Importin α5 binds to the nuclear localising signal (NLS) of phosphorylated and dimerised STAT1 and 2, and acts as a chaperone to actively traffic the STATs into the nucleus (Sekimoto et al. 1997; Melen et al. 2001; Fagerlund et al. 2002). In the non-phosphorylated state, the NLS is masked and nuclear translocation of STAT1 and 2 is thought to be facilitated by direct binding to nucleoporins; alternatively, the STAT protein may be transported by binding to heterologous NLS-containing proteins (Banninger and Reich 2004; Marg et al. 2004). Interestingly, another mechanism

has been described for STAT1 during monocyte differentiation, whereby STAT1 binds to nucleolin and it is the NLS of nucleolin that facilitates STAT1 nuclear translocation (Jerke et al. 2009).

In contrast to STAT1 and 2, STAT3 contains a constitutive form of the NLS that allows nuclear accumulation of both phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated STAT3 through association with importin α3 and in a tissue-dependent manner, with importin α6 (Kohler et al. 1997; Liu et al. 2005). Less is known about nuclear trafficking of other STATs although the importin system has been implicated for both STAT5A and STAT6 (Kawashima et al. 2009; Chen and Reich 2010). Rac1 and Rac GTPase-activating protein (MgcRacGAP) have been reported to enhance the nuclear accumulation of STAT3 and STAT5A and subsequent transcriptional activity (Kawashima et al. 2006, 2009).

Once in the nucleus, STAT dimers or higher order complexes are stabilised by NT:NT interactions and bind cooperatively to tandem sequence elements within promoter regions (often referred to as GAS elements) (Vinkemeier et al. 1996; Xu et al. 1996) to activate the transcription of specific gene subsets. All STATs bind to similar palindromic elements represented by a core TTCN<sub>2-4</sub>GAA consensus sequence (Horvath et al. 1995). STAT1, 3 and 4 prefer a sequence separated by three nucleotides, while STAT6 prefers a sequence separated by four nucleotides (Ehret et al. 2001). The crystal structure of the phosphodimer core (CC, DBD and SH2 domain) bound to DNA revealed a clamp-like configuration stabilised by the reciprocal SH2-phosphotyrosine interactions and the interface of the DBDs with DNA, with the four alpha-helices of the CC domain projecting outward (Becker et al. 1998; Chen et al. 1998).

Serine phosphorylation of a conserved mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) consensus sequence within the TAD (ProMetSerPro within STAT1, 3 and 4 and ProLeuSerPro within STAT5) (Frank et al. 1997; Kovarik et al. 1998; Yamashita et al. 1998; Visconti et al. 2000) by various serine kinases (e.g. MAPK, p38, JNK, PKCδ, mTOR and PI3K)

Sequences are identical in mouse and human STATs, with the exception of STAT6 (RG<sub>p</sub>YVST in mouse).
(Goh et al. 1999; Decker and Kovarik 2000; Chendilet al. 2002; Deb et al. 2003; Rhee et al. 2003) greatly increases STAT-mediated gene transcription (Boulton et al. 1995; Kovarik et al. 1998, 1999; Goh et al. 1999; Visconti et al. 2000), and the truncated STAT isoforms, which lack the TAD, are largely thought to act as dominant negatives (Shuai et al. 1993; Caldenhoven et al. 1996; Yoo et al. 2002). To add another layer of complexity, it has been suggested that unphosphorylated STAT3b dimers are also transcriptionally active, and initiate a distinct set of genes from that of the phosphorylated STAT (Yang et al. 2005; Cheon et al. 2011).

Once released from DNA, the STAT dimer is thought to undergo a conformational change (parallel back to antiparallel, stabilised by NT:NT and CC:DBD interfaces), which exposes the C-terminal phosphotyrosines to phosphatase activity. Dephosphorylation and detachment of DNA are required for STATs to exit the nucleus (Zhong et al. 2005; Mertens et al. 2006) via a process that is dependent on the nuclear export signal of the STAT molecules and the nuclear export factor, chromosome region maintenance 1 (Haspel et al. 1996; Begitt et al. 2000; McBride et al. 2000; Mowen and David 2000; Zeng et al. 2002; Bhattacharya and Schindler 2003; Meyer et al. 2003; Banninger and Reich 2004; Marg et al. 2004); thus completing the activation and deactivation cycle.

In addition to tyrosine and serine phosphorylation, a number of post-translational modifications have been reported to regulate STAT activity. Acetylation of STAT3 on Lys685 by p300/CBP contributes to stable dimer formation and to transcriptional activation (Bhattacharya et al. 1996; Zhang et al. 1996; Korzus et al. 1998; Paulson et al. 1999; Yuan et al. 2005); controversially, acetylation has also been suggested to facilitate dephosphorylation and latency of STAT1 (Kramer et al. 2009). While STAT1 may be acetylated in some circumstances, others cannot reproduce the link between acetylation and dephosphorylation (Antunes et al. 2011). The role of PIAS1 in regulating STAT1 activity by small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) conjugation of Lys703 has also been controversial (Rogers et al. 2003; Ungureanu et al. 2003, 2005; Song et al. 2006). PIAS1 and the impact of SUMO-conjugation are discussed in more detail in the following section.

### Negative regulation of JAK-STAT signalling

Given that JAK-STAT signalling is the universal and essential intracellular pathway for cytokine action, a number of regulatory mechanisms have evolved to control the magnitude and duration of signalling. This allows fine-tuning of cytokine-mediated cellular effects and prevents the inappropriate activity often associated with disease development. There are three major mechanisms for negative regulation: receptor internalisation, de-phosphorylation by protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) and direct inhibition by protein inhibitors of activated STATs (PIAS) and suppressor of cytokine signalling (SOCS) proteins. The importance of receptor internalisation by endocytic vesicles and subsequent receptor degradation by proteasomal and/or lysosomal pathways (Dittrich et al. 1996; Thiel et al. 1998; Uotani et al. 1999; Yen et al. 2000; van Kerkhof and Strous 2001; Walrafen et al. 2005; Martinez-Moczygemba et al. 2007; Kindwall-Keller et al. 2008) is classically illustrated by the mutations acquired in the cytoplasmic domain of the G-CSF receptor and found in patients with severe congenital neutropenia. These mutations result in truncation of the cytoplasmic tail of the granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSFR), simultaneously blocking maturation signalling by G-CSF and leading to defective ligand-induced internalisation, as a consequence, the strong proliferative signal predisposes these patients to acute myeloid leukaemia (Dong et al. 1995; Hunter and Avalos 1999; Ward et al. 1999).

Since tyrosine phosphorylation is integral to JAK-STAT signal transduction, various tyrosine phosphatases such as SH2 domain-containing phosphatase (SHP) 1, SHP2, PTP1B, T-cell PTP (TC-PTP) and CD45 are involved in attenuation of signalling, acting either at the membrane to target the receptor-kinase complex, or in the nucleus to target STAT. SHP1 can directly interact with a number of receptors (including the EPOR and IFNα-receptor complex) and can inhibit JAK1 and JAK2 phosphorylation (David et al. 1995; Klingmuller et al. 1995). SHP2 has been shown to prevent JAK1 (You et al. 1999), STAT5α (Chen et al. 2003) and STAT1 phosphorylation (the latter at both tyrosine and serine residues) (Wu et al. 2002). PTP1B dephosphorylates JAK1 and TYK2 (Myers et al. 2001), while TC-PTP targets JAK1 and JAK3 (Simoncic et al. 2002). TC45, a nuclear isoform of TC-PTP, dephosphorylates STAT1 and STAT3 (ten Hoeve et al. 2002). Unlike other PTPs, expression of CD45 is restricted to haemopoietic cells and has been demonstrated to indiscriminately dephosphorylate the various JAKs (Irie-Sasaki et al. 2001).

The PIAS family of E3 SUMO ligases consists of four members, PIAS1, PIASx, PIAS3 and PIASy, and various alternatively spliced isoforms. They were originally named as protein inhibitors of activated STAT because of the observation that PIAS1 and PIAS3 could block STAT1 and STAT3 DNA-binding activity when over-expressed (Chung et al. 1997; Liu et al. 1998). PIASx and PIASy were also shown to inhibit STAT4 and STAT1-mediated transcription, respectively, but without affecting DNA binding, presumably by recruiting co-repressors such as histone deacetylases (Liu et al. 2001; Arora et al. 2003). The role of PIAS1-mediated SUMO-conjugation of
STAT1 has been controversial; SUMOylation of Lys703 has been suggested to selectively inhibit a subset of STAT1-responsive genes (Ungureanu et al. 2005), with contradictory results suggesting that it is unlikely to have an effect on STAT1 transcription (Song et al. 2006). Apart from PIAS1, which is indeed a partial physiological regulator of STAT1 (Liu et al. 2004), knockouts of other PIAS members revealed relatively little role in STAT-dependent pathways (Roth et al. 2004; Wong et al. 2004; Santti et al. 2005). It is now clear that the primary E3 activity of PIAS regulates proteins other than the STATs, and may in fact, regulate a general cellular process that impacts on many proteins (Kotaja et al. 2002; Schmidt and Muller 2003; Shuai and Liu 2005).

A new twist on the SUMOylation story has recently emerged from the Vinkemeier group with evidence that SUMO-conjugation obstructs tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1, resulting in ‘semi-phosphorylated’ dimers and preventing the polymerisation and assembly of STAT1 into paracrystalline arrays in the nucleus, enhancing STAT1 de-phosphorylation (Droescher et al. 2011). The physiological consequences of SUMO-conjugation were explored with a ‘knock-in’ mutation (Glu705-Gln), which abolished SUMO-conjugation of Lys730 and resulted in enhanced IFN-γ signalling, suggesting that SUMOylation of STAT1 may be a unique mechanism that has evolved to negatively regulate this pathway. The identity of the E3 SUMO ligase responsible remains unclear (Begitt et al. 2011).

activity. SOCS1 and SOCS3 have a 12 amino acid region adjacent to the SH2 domain, known as the kinase inhibitory region (KIR), which was originally thought to act as a pseudo-substrate blocking the enzymatic activity of JAK by binding to its catalytic cleft (Nicholson et al. 1999; Sasaki et al. 1999; Yasukawa et al. 1999). We now know that the SOCS3 KIR binds directly to a conserved ‘GlyGlnMet’ motif located within the atypical insertion loop of the JAK1, JAK2 and TYK2, but not JAK3 kinase domains, with the KIR binding in a manner that does not compete with either substrate or ATP binding (Babon et al. 2012).

SOCS1 and SOCS3 can be recruited to the receptor complex through the SH2 domain binding directly to JAK or to the receptor, although the former probably only occurs with SOCS over-expression (Endo et al. 1997; Bjorbaek et al. 1999; Bousquet et al. 1999; Pezet et al. 1999; Nicholson et al. 2000; Qing et al. 2005; Fenner et al. 2006). It is most likely that SH2 binding to phosphorylated receptor tyrosine residues brings the KIR into proximity with the JAK kinase domain, and indeed SOCS3 can bind simultaneously to a gp30 phosphopeptide via its SH2 domain and to JAK via the KIR (Babon et al. 2012). SOCS1 and SOCS3 can also attenuate signal transduction by targeting the receptor and/or JAK for ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, although gene-targeting studies, in which only the SOCS box was deleted, suggest that regulation by the SOCS box is the lesser component of SOCS1 and SOCS3 activity (Zhang et al. 2001; Boyle et al. 2007). Other SOCS proteins such as SOCS2 and CIS also appear to have a dual inhibitory function, blocking signalling by competitive binding to STAT docking sites on the receptor (Matsumoto et al. 1997; Ram and Waxman 1999, 2000; Greenhalgh et al. 2002) and via SOCS box-dependent mechanisms (Verdier et al. 1998; Ram and Waxman 2000; Greenhalgh et al. 2005; Landsman and Waxman 2005).

The suppressors of cytokine signalling

Perhaps the most studied inhibitors of JAK-STAT signalling are the SOCS proteins (Hilton et al. 1998). This family of small, cytokine-inducible proteins inhibits signal transduction by blocking JAK and STAT activation and phosphorylation, creating a negative feedback loop. Their induction by cytokines or other stimuli can also cross-regulate signals downstream of other cytokines (Bode et al. 1999; Kiu et al. 2007). There are eight family members, SOCS1–7 and cytokine-inducible SH2-containing protein (CIS) (Starr et al. 1997; Hilton et al. 1998); each containing an NT region of variable length with little sequence conservation, a central SH2 domain and a conserved C-terminal SOCS box motif, which interacts with elongins B and C, recruiting Cullin 5, and RING-box 2 (Rbx2) to form an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (Babon et al. 2009). The SOCS proteins therefore function as adaptors to bring the E3 ligase into proximity with its substrate, promoting the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of SOCS binding partners (Kamura et al. 1998; Zhang et al. 1999, 2001).

In addition to their role as E3 ligases, SOCS1 and SOCS3 are able to directly inhibit JAK enzymatic

prolactin and IL-2 signalling (Matsumoto et al. 1999; Li et al. 2000). The pathways regulated by SOCS 4–7 are not as well characterised, with these SOCS proteins functioning largely outside of the JAK–STAT paradigm.

Methylation of the SOCS genes provides another layer of regulation within the JAK–STAT pathway, with hypermethylation of CpG islands within the SOCS1 and SOCS3 promoters correlating with transcriptional silencing in various tumours (Yoshikawa et al. 2001; Galm et al. 2003; He et al. 2003; Liu et al. 2003).

While much of the JAK/STAT signalling cascade is well understood, surprisingly, some important aspects remain unknown, resulting no doubt from the difficulties in producing recombinant full-length JAK protein, the low levels of endogenous proteins and a lack of quality, high-affinity antibodies. Some questions remain, such as how the signal is initiated, which JAK initiates the signal and what is the sequence of phosphorylation events required for activation (and deactivation)? Complete structural information will no doubt clarify how JAK interacts with the receptor and the interplay between the different JAK domains. Similarly, the structure of JAK bound to its negative regulators, the SOCS proteins, is likely to reveal how this family of small molecules controls the extent and magnitude of signalling.

### Specificity and diversity of action

Specificity and diversity is introduced into the JAK–STAT signalling pathway by a number of mechanisms. It is initiated by ligand binding to specific receptors, with the differential expression of various receptor subunits determining the cell types that will respond and the magnitude of the response. The receptor–JAK complex is determined by the sequence of the receptor cytoplasmic domains and although this results in different combinations of JAKs (Figure 1), it is not yet clear whether the JAKs display selectivity for phosphorylation of individual STAT or receptor tyrosine motifs and indeed, a comparison of the JAK2 and JAK3 JH1 domains suggests a significant overlap in substrate specificity (Sanz et al. 2011). Rather, it is the STAT-SH2 domain, which drives specificity of signalling, with the sequences surrounding the phosphorylated receptor tyrosine residues determining STAT recruitment to the receptor (Table I). Similarly, the combination of STATs and the pairing of SH2 domain with phosphotyrosine ligand determines the formation of the homo- or heterodimeric complexes (Heim et al. 1995; Stahl et al. 1995). The relative stabilities of STAT homo-dimers and heterodimers and their association with other transcription factors (e.g. IRF, Sp1, Jun, Fos, NF-kB and glucocorticoid receptor) and/or coactivators (e.g. p300/CBP, PCAF, GCN5, BRG1 and

HDAC) further broadens the range of STAT/DNA-binding complexes and transcriptional activities, contributing to the biological diversity (Bhattacharya et al. 1996; Zhang et al. 1996; Korzus et al. 1998; Paulson et al. 1999).

In addition to tyrosine and serine phosphorylation, various post-translational modifications (as discussed earlier) provide another level of regulation to modulate STAT transcriptional responses. The negative regulators of JAK–STAT signalling are also important determinants of specificity. A typical example of this is SOCS3 regulation of IL-6 signalling, where expression of SOCS3 prevents IFNγ-like STAT1 transcriptional responses (Croker et al. 2003). In fact, the differential expression of downstream components such as the JAKs, STATS or SOCS can also contribute to the specificity of the cytokine response. Limited proteolytic processing of the C-terminus has been described for a number of the STAT proteins and is generally thought to generate a dominant-negative protein, reviewed in Hendry and John (2004). However, a recent study suggests that oestrogen-induced proteolytic cleavage of STAT1 may enhance, rather than inhibit, inflammatory responses (Dai et al. 2009).

#### Role of the JAK/STAT pathway in clinical disease

There have been many papers examining the role of STATs in malignancy and transformation, reviewed in Putoczki and Ernst (2010) and Santos and Costa-Pereira (2011), Ferbeyre and Moriggl (2011) and Li et al. (2011). In this context, studies expressing mutant JAK (Schwaller et al. 1998) and STAT proteins (either dominant-negative or constitutively active) have been particularly informative (Bromberg et al. 1998; Onishi et al. 1998; Turkson et al. 1998; Bromberg et al. 1999; Moriggl et al. 2005). Here we have chosen to focus on the role of the JAK kinases in clinical disease.

#### Loss of function mutations

Inactivating JAK3 mutations has been documented in humans with SCID, characterised by loss of T and NK cells, abnormal B cell function and hypoplasia of lymphoid tissues (Macchi et al. 1995; Russell et al. 1995). The clinical phenotypes induced by JAK3 mutations are indistinguishable from those resulting from loss-of-function mutations in the γc (Matthews et al. 1995), indicating that JAK3 is indispensable for signal transduction from these receptors and hence indispensable for lymphoid development. Similarly, a homozygous mutation in TYK2 that resulted in the generation of a premature stop codon and subsequent loss of protein expression has been reported in a patient with hyper-IgE syndrome. This patient was highly susceptible to infections by multiple microorganisms, and the patient's cells showed defective

responses to IL-12, type I IFNs, IL-6, IL-23 and  
IL-10, demonstrating the importance of TYK 2 for  
both innate and acquired immunity in humans  
(Minegishi et al. 2006). This study also highlights  
some of the species differences that exist between  
mouse and humans as for instance the Tyk2 mice  
do not appear to have defective IL-6 signalling  
(Karaghiosoff et al. 2000; Minegishi et al. 2006).

Gain-of-function mutations

While loss-of-function mutations in JAK3 and TYK2  
are associated with immunodeficiency, the majority  
of naturally occurring mutations in JAK2, including  
chromosomal translocation, point mutations, insertions  
and deletions, are gain-of-function mutations  
and are associated with acute leukaemia or myelo-  
proliferative disorders (MPDs). The chromosomal  
translocations of JAK2 loci (e.g. TEL-JAK2, PCM1-  
JAK2, BCR-JAK2 and PAX-JAK2) lead to the  
development of both myeloid and lymphoid haema-  
tological malignancies (Jatiani et al. 2010). These  
translocations result in fusion of the JAK2 catalytic  
kinase (JH1) domain with multimerisation subunits  
of partner proteins leading to constitutive tyrosine  
kinase activity and transformation.

Interestingly, point mutations, deletions and  
insertions in JAK2 are localised to the pseudokinase  
(JH2) domain and are associated with patients  
with MPDs. Since its discovery in 2005, most of  
the research has focused on the JAK2 V617F  
mutation (Baxter et al. 2005; James et al. 2005;  
Kralovics et al. 2005; Levine et al. 2005). It is a  
somatic, gain-of-function mutation that has been  
frequently found in classic Philadelphia chromosome-  
negative MPNs, in more than 90% of patients with  
polycythemia vera, and in over 50% of patients  
with essential thrombocythemia and primary myelo-  
fibrosis (Campbell and Green 2006). Valine 617 lies  
within the pseudokinase (JH2) domain, and substitution  
of the valine with phenylalanine reduces the  
ability of JH2 to repress kinase activity, leading  
to constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK2.  
As a result, it confers cytokine independence and/or  
hypersensitivity to the mutated cells giving them a  
survival advantage.

It is believed that STAT5 is required to mediate  
altered gene expression and subsequent transformation  
by mutant JAK2 (Funakoshi-Tago et al. 2010).  
However, recent findings suggest that JAK2 can  
also bypass STAT transcriptional activity by acting as  
an epigenetic modulator. Dawson et al. observed  
nuclear localisation of JAK2 in haemopoietic cells,  
in which it phosphorylated histone 3 at tyrosine 41  
(H3Y41) to inhibit binding of the transcriptional  
repressor heterochromatin protein-1α, enhancing the  
expression of genes that are not necessarily under  
direct STAT-mediated control (Dawson et al. 2009).

Similarly, in ES cells JAK2V617F was able to bypass  
Stat3 activation to maintain pluripotency, again  
correlating with an increase in H3Y41 phosphorylation  
(Griffiths et al. 2011). Liu et al. found that  
JAK2 interaction with and phosphorylation of a type  
II arginine methyltransferase, protein arginine methyl-  
transferase 5 (PRMT5), inhibited its methyltransferase activity and consequently, histone methylation  
(Liu et al. 2011). While some controversy still  
surrounds JAK localisation in the nucleus (Girodon  
et al. 2011), these studies demonstrate the ability of  
JAK2 to disrupt chromatin stability and potentiate  
the oncogenic properties of the V617F mutation.

Given the involvement of the V617F mutation in  
MPNs, most of the therapeutic development has  
focused on identifying low molecular mass ATP-  
competitive JAK2 inhibitors, reviewed in Haan et al.  
(2010), Quintas-Cardama et al. (2011). TG101348  
and Ruxolitinib (or INCB018424) (Verstovsek et al.  
2010; Pardanani et al. 2011) are two of many selective  
and potent JAK inhibitors currently in use in phase II  
and III MPN clinical trials, respectively. Ruxolitinib  
has a strong inhibitory effect on both JAK1 and JAK2,  
while TG101348 has greater selectivity for JAK2.  
Both of these inhibitors effectively attenuate downstream  
signalling, including phosphorylation of  
STAT and ERK1/2, and induce apoptosis in vitro.  
MPN patients treated with these inhibitors demonstrated  
a dramatic improvement in constitutional  
symptoms and a reduction in spleen size. Although  
unpleasant side effects and a less satisfactory  
improvement in cytopenia, marrow fibrosis and  
JAKV617F burden were also observed, inhibition of  
JAK2 has already proven to be an excellent target  
for therapeutic intervention in MPNs.

What the future holds

The past 20 years have seen the JAK/STAT field  
progress from the discovery of the individual  
components and delineation of the pathway, to an  
understanding of the role of the JAKs and STATs in  
human disease, which coupled with resolution of the  
molecular structures should result in JAK inhibitors  
becoming a routine part of clinical treatment.
