# A protective role for innate immunity in systemic lupus erythematosus

**Michael C. Carroll**

Abstract | Clinical and genetic studies in humans and animal models indicate a crucial protective role for the complement system in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). This presents a paradox because the complement system is considered to be an important mediator of the inflammation that is observed in patients with SLE. One current view is that complement provides protection by facilitating the rapid removal of apoptotic debris to circumvent an autoimmune response. In this Opinion article, I discuss an alternative model in which complement — together with other components of the innate immune system — participates in the ‘presentation’ of SLE-inducing self-antigens to developing B cells. In this way, the complement system and innate immunity protect against responses to SLE (self) antigens by enhancing the elimination of self-reactive lymphocytes.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an incurable autoimmune disease of unknown aetiology that affects more than one million individuals each year¹. It is characterized by circulating IgG autoantibodies that are specific for self-antigens, such as DNA, nuclear proteins and certain cytoplasmic components. Immune complexes comprising autoantibody and self-antigen mediate a systemic inflammatory response. IgG-containing immune complexes are particularly pathogenic because they both activate the complement system (BOX 1) and crosslink Fc receptors expressed by leukocytes². Activation of complement leads to the release of the pro-inflammatory peptides complement component 3a (C3a) and C5a, which function in a synergistic manner with Fc-receptor crosslinking to activate mast cells and stimulate inflammatory cells, thereby leading to tissue injury. SLE is considered to be a B-cell disorder because of the pathogenic nature of the autoantibodies and because disease fails to develop in the absence of B cells³, although self-reactive T cells that promote class-switch recombination (CSR) and somatic hypermutation (SHM) are also required. Recent studies using mouse models of SLE also indicate a role for B-cell expression of Toll-like receptors (TLRs), stimulation through which CSR and possibly SHM can be potentiated, similar to the engagement of TLRs expressed by T cells³⁴. The source of antigen is probably apoptotic blebs that include nuclear proteins and chromatin, the main targets for most autoantibodies in SLE⁵. Interestingly, SLE antigens have the common characteristic of being highly conserved and are probably cleared by similar innate mechanisms as microbial antigens, which could provide an important clue to the mechanism of this clearance (discussed later).

The complement system, which is an important mediator of inflammation, is a family of more than 20 serum and cell-surface proteins that function as a cascade — in a manner similar to the blood-coagulation pathway — resulting in the induction of inflammation (BOX 1) and the enhancement of the adaptive immune system⁶,⁷. Chronic release of immune complexes formed by IgG and self-antigen activates the C1 complex, leading to the formation of C3 convertase and the enzymatic cleavage of the central complement component C3. Activation of C3 — the most abundant of the serum complement proteins — results in covalent attachment of the C3b fragment to pathogens and/or host cells. This is an important step for amplification through the alternative complement pathway and for continued activation of the terminal complex (C5 to C9) (BOX 1). Moreover, coupling of activated C3 to host cells provides a ligand for various receptors that are expressed by macrophages, granulocytes and mast cells, which become activated and enhance inflammation after ligation of these receptors.

Intriguingly, as discussed later, despite being an important mediator of inflammation, the classical complement pathway can be protective in patients with SLE, leading to the paradox that, on the one hand, complement is pathogenic but, on the other, it is protective. Early attempts to explain a protective role for the complement system in SLE focused on its intrinsic role in clearance of immune complexes⁸,⁹. Because a hallmark of SLE is the development of IgG-containing immune complexes, it was proposed that complement provides protection by the rapid clearance of complexes, which limits their pathogenicity¹⁰. Although this effector function is probably important, it would not explain the initial formation of autoantibodies in complement-deficient individuals, so more recently, the clearance hypothesis was formulated to explain how defects in the uptake of apoptotic cells can lead to the formation of SLE autoantibodies. In this Opinion article, I review the evidence supporting this model and discuss its strengths and weaknesses. In addition, I present an alternative model that proposes a novel role for the innate immune system in the regulation of self-reactive B cells. These two models are not necessarily mutually exclusive.

PERSPECTIVES

**The SLE paradox**

Susceptibility to SLE is heritable, and studies in humans and mice indicate that multiple genetic loci are involved^{11–13}. An exception to polygenic predisposition to disease seems to be single-gene deficiency in either C1 (Clq, Clr or Cls) or C4. Notably, individuals who are deficient in C3 have a low level of susceptibility to SLE compared with individuals who are deficient in C1 or C4, which are major susceptibility factors. For several decades, it has been clear that individuals who are deficient in the C1 and C4 early complement proteins almost always develop SLE. Although genetic deficiencies in the individual loci are rare, acquired deficiencies that result from drugs that inactivate C4 or from the development of antibodies specific for Clq can also lead to SLE^{14,15}. Moreover, partial deficiency in C4 — of which there are two human isoforms, C4A and C4B — is relatively common and is an important factor for susceptibility to SLE in the Scandinavian population^{16,17}. Taken together, these observations indicate that the early complement proteins are important in protecting humans against the development of SLE. Mice that are deficient in Clq^{18} or C4 (REFS 19,20) are also predisposed to SLE-like disease, but the frequency and severity of disease is strain dependent. For example, mice that are deficient in Clq or C4 on a mixed background of 129 and C57BL/6 develop SLE autoantibodies and evidence of renal disease, whereas the same deficiency on a C57BL/6 background has little effect. As noted earlier, these observations present a paradox because the complement system is also an important effector of the innate immunity and inflammation that mediate the pathogenesis of SLE^{6}.

More than a century ago, Bordet and Gengou identified a heat-sensitive substance in the blood that was required for the lysis of antibody-coated bacteria and erythrocytes^{55}. They named the substance ‘complement’. It is now clear that the complement system is a large family of 20 or more serum proteins and cell-surface receptors that are crucial for both innate and adaptive immunity^{6}. The complement system is activated by three different pathways: the classical, lectin and alternative complement pathways (see figure). The classical pathway is initiated by activation of the complement component 1 (C1) complex by IgM- or IgG-containing immune complexes. Activated C1 cleaves C4 and C2 to generate C4b–C2b (also known as the classical C3 convertase), which converts C3 to C3a and C3b. The complement proteins C4 and C3 both have an internal thioester bond that becomes exposed after activation and forms spontaneous covalent ester or amide links with antigens^{56–59}. Activated C3 (C3b) combines with C4b–C2b to form C4b–C2b–C3b (also known as the classical C5 convertase), which converts C5 to C5a and C5b. Alternatively, C3b can interact with factor B to form C3b–Bb (also known as the alternative C3 convertase) and C3b–Bb–C3b (also known as the alternative C5 convertase). The alternative complement pathway can also be activated spontaneously when C3 binds covalently to acceptor sites and interacts with factor B to form an active C3 convertase. The lectin complement pathway is activated when collectins, such as mannan-binding lectin (MBL) or ficolins, bind their ligands (mannan or N-acetylglucosamine, respectively), which are expressed by microbial pathogens. Both ficolins and MBL — which is structurally similar to Clq — are associated with MBL serine proteases (MASPs), which cleave C4 and C2 to form a C3 convertase^{52,60}. iC3b, inactivated C3b.

**Innate immunity and SLE**

With the advent of gene targeting and the availability of genetically modified strains of mice, it has become evident that single-gene deficiencies in other components of the innate immune system also predispose individuals to SLE-like disease. Intriguingly, mice that are deficient in serum amyloid protein (SAP)^{21,22}, DNase I (REF. 23), natural IgM^{24,25} or the receptor for C3b and C4b (complement receptor 1, CR1; also known as CD35) (REFS 26–28) develop SLE-like disease in a strain-dependent manner. What do these proteins have in common with early complement components? SAP and DNase I function together to bind and degrade chromatin that is released by dying or apoptotic cells, thereby clearing the potential SLE autoantigens from the body. Natural IgM, which accounts for most of the IgM in the circulation and is produced mainly by B1 cells (a particular subset of B cells), is an important recognition protein that binds many of the known SLE antigens and activates the Clq-dependent classical complement pathway^{29,30}. Although many of these IgM proteins are self-reactive, they seem to be protective rather than harmful. Clq can also bind double-stranded DNA, directly leading to the activation of C4 through the classical complement pathway^{31}. Mannan-binding lectin (MBL) also binds apoptotic debris, and through activation of MBL serine protease 2 (MASP2), it induces cleavage of C4 to C4b (using the lectin complement pathway)^{32,33}. After activation through the classical or lectin complement pathways, C4b binds antigen, and these

complexes can be rapidly cleared from the system without activating inflammation, through their uptake by phagocytic cells that express CR1 or Clq receptors^{34,35}. In humans, CR1 provides an important mechanism for the clearance of C3b- and C4b-bound antigens without activation of an inflammatory response, and it is widely expressed by B cells, erythrocytes and other haematopoietic cells, as well as certain stromal cells^{36}. In mice, expression of CR1 is more limited, but it is known to participate in the uptake of C3b- and C4b-bound antigens by B cells and stromal cells in the lymphoid compartment^{37}. Recently, a novel CR1-like receptor transcript (CR1L) was identified in human haematopoietic cells and fetal liver^{38}. The novel receptor is a truncated form of CR1 that includes the binding site for the inactivated form of C4b (iC4b) but not for the equivalent form of C3b (iC3b). So, it is the first reported receptor that binds C4b but not C3b, indicating a function for C4 that is independent of that of C3. Together, these results allow one to envisage a common pathway in which the innate immune system participates in the specific binding, degradation and clearance of apoptotic debris in a non-inflammatory manner. This indicates that innate immunity, including complement, is protective against the development of SLE, possibly through the scavenging of apoptotic debris.

**The clearance hypothesis**

Given the importance of the complement system and related serum proteins in the uptake and clearance of apoptotic blebs, Walport and colleagues have proposed that defects in this pathway could result in overt presentation of self-antigens and development of high-affinity IgG autoantibodies^{18}. This hypothesis is known as the clearance hypothesis. Accordingly, this hypothesis states that innate immunity protects by sequestering apoptotic debris, thereby preventing exposure of the adaptive immune system to SLE antigens (FIG. 2a). The model is supported by results that show a correlation between deficiency in Clq or C4 and impaired clearance of apoptotic debris^{15,18,35}. This indicates that, in the absence of the relevant innate pathway, apoptotic debris is not effectively cleared, and it accumulates in tissues that are rich in dying cells. So, the attraction of the clearance hypothesis is that it explains a known function of complement (and the associated innate pathways) in the clearance of putative SLE antigens, and deficiencies in this pathway might be predicted to result in accumulation of

Figure 1 | **Autoantibody-mediated pathogenesis of SLE.** Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease that is characterized by autoantibodies specific for highly conserved nuclear antigens, such as double-stranded DNA, histones and ribonuclear proteins. The requirements for the activation and response of self-reactive B cells — the source of autoantibodies — seem to be similar to those of normal, mature B cells. Encounter with cognate self-antigen in the presence of T-cell help induces activation (**a**). Activated B cells then form germinal centres, where they undergo class-switch recombination, somatic hypermutation and clonal selection — forming both effector and memory B cells. Effector B cells release IgG autoantibodies into the circulation (**b**), where they form immune complexes in the presence of ligands (SLE antigens). Despite the normal mechanisms (such as the complement system) for the uptake and clearance of immune complexes, excess immune complexes accumulate in the small vessels of organs, such as the kidney, where they become pathogenic. Accumulated immune complexes induce inflammation through local activation of the complement system and/or the binding of Fc receptors, which leads to the degranulation of mast cells and the infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages (**c**).

self-antigens in sites such as the lymphoid compartment, where they could become immunogenic.

There are several concerns inherent in this hypothesis. First, as noted earlier, in humans and mice, deficiency in C3 is only a minor susceptibility factor for SLE compared with deficiency in Clq or C4 (REF. 39). Given the importance of C3 for the elimination of immune complexes, it would seem that if the clearance of apoptotic debris is the main role of complement in protection, then C3 deficiency might be expected to have a considerable effect on susceptibility to SLE. Second, it seems unlikely that innate immunity is effective in concealing or sequestering all of the apoptotic debris that is released from dying cells. This seems especially unlikely in the lymphoid compartment, where there is a high frequency of dying cells and mature lymphocytes that could respond to cognate antigen are present. Third, another limitation of this model is that it implies that self-reactive mature lymphocytes are present in the circulation and respond when exposed to SLE self-antigens. However, given the rigorous negative selection of B cells (BOX 3) and T cells, it seems unlikely that apoptotic debris directly activates circulating lymphocytes^{40}. However, it is known that inappropriate presentation of self-antigens — such as occurs after intravenous injection of apoptotic cells — can induce a loss of tolerance and production of autoantibodies^{41}.

PERSPECTIVES

The tolerance hypothesis

In an attempt to explain how defects in innate immunity could account for a loss of B-cell tolerance and the production of self-reactive antibodies, I propose an alternative hypothesis, which is referred to as the tolerance hypothesis. This hypothesis states that the innate immune system ‘delivers’ self-antigens to developing B cells (and possibly T cells) to enhance their negative selection (FIG. 2b). Therefore, defects in innate immunity would result in loss of efficient B-cell tolerance and escape of self-reactive cells into the circulation. During development, B cells, similar to T cells, undergo rigorous negative selection to eliminate potentially self-reactive lymphocytes (BOX 3). When developing self-reactive B cells encounter self-antigen, they undergo receptor editing, clonal deletion or anergy<sup>42</sup>. Therefore, the tolerance hypothesis presumes that B-cell tolerance is efficient and that self-reactive cells are eliminated during normal development. The rationale for the hypothesis is that the classical complement pathway has a known role in the regulation of both B- and T-cell activation<sup>43</sup> (BOX 2). For example, mice deficient in Clq<sup>44</sup>, secreted IgM<sup>45</sup>, C4 (REF.46), C3 (REF.47), CR1 or **CR2** (also known as CD21) (REFS 48,49) have defective B-cell responses to T-cell-dependent and T-cell-independent antigens. Given the importance of innate immunity in directing or instructing the humoral response to non-self-antigens, it seems logical that the pathway is also involved in directing the encounter of self-reactive B cells with self-antigens. Deficiency in this pathway would result in reduced exposure to self-antigens and would allow self-reactive cells to escape to the periphery (FIG. 2b). So, in normal mice, uptake of Clq- and/or C4-bound self-antigen complexes present on stromal cells would provide an efficient mechanism for presentation of self-antigens to immature self-reactive B cells, thereby resulting in their elimination.

Experimental support for a role for complement in B-cell tolerance derives from studies in which complement-deficient mice are crossed with mice that carry a transgene encoding a hen-egg lysozyme (HEL)-specific immunoglobulin or transgenes for both this HEL-specific immunoglobulin and a soluble form of HEL (sHEL). In this well-characterized model, the HEL-specific B cells seem to develop normally in the absence of self-antigen, but when mice expressing the HEL-specific immunoglobulin transgene are crossed with mice that express sHEL, the transgenic B cells are anergic, fail to fully mature in the peripheral lymph nodes and have a reduced lifespan. Development of anergy depends on the strength of the signal through the B-cell receptor (BCR), because low serum levels of sHEL or mutations that reduce the strength of the signal through the BCR result in a loss of non-responsiveness and an extended lifespan<sup>50</sup>. Moreover, the form in which self-antigen is encountered — that is, soluble, membrane-bound or aggregate — affects the signal through the BCR and the extent of negative selection. To test whether early complement proteins or their receptors, CR1 and CR2, are important in the development of B-cell tolerance in the HEL model, mice deficient in C3, C4 or CR1 and CR2 were crossed with the double-transgenic mice. Deficiency in either

Box 2 | Complement enhances the adaptive immune response

Fearon and Locksley were the first to propose that the complement system instructs the B-cell response through complement receptors, thereby bridging the innate and adaptive immune pathways<sup>61</sup>. Recognition and binding of foreign antigens by molecules of the innate immune system — such as C-reactive protein, natural IgM, collectins (mannan-binding lectin or ficolin) — or by specific antibody produced by cognate B cells leads to activation of the complement system (BOX 1) and covalent attachment of complement component 3b (C3b) to the protein or carbohydrate antigen (see figure, part a). Attachment of C3b to an antigen marks the antigen as foreign and provides a ligand for complement receptors. Rapid inactivation of C3b to iC3b and subsequently to C3d by complement-control proteins and factor I provides ligands for different receptors. Complement receptor 1 (CR1) and CR2, which are expressed by B cells and follicular dendritic cells (FDCs), recognize C4b, C3b, iC3b and C3d. Phagocytic receptors, such as CR3 (also known as CD11b–CD18) and CR4 (also known as CD11c–CD18), recognize iC3b but not C3b or C3d. On B cells, CR2 (and CR1 in mice) can form a co-receptor when complexed with CD19 and CD81. Co-ligation of the B-cell receptor (BCR) and the co-receptor by C3d-coated antigen enhances B-cell signalling<sup>62</sup> (see figure, part b). The importance of B-cell expression of the CR2–CD19–CD81 co-receptor has been confirmed *in vivo* by studies using mice with a disrupted Cr2 locus (which are deficient in both CR1 and CR2)<sup>48,49,63</sup> and by immunization of wild-type mice with fusion proteins consisting of hen-egg lysozyme and multiple copies of C3d<sup>64</sup>. The retention of antigen by FDCs through CR1 and CR2 is also important in humoral immune responses<sup>65,66</sup>. Similar to C3, activated C4 (that is, C4b) covalently binds antigen and could enhance B-cell signalling through the co-receptor or enhance uptake by FDCs (see figure, part c; FIG. 2). In mice, CR1 forms a functional co-receptor with CD19 and CD81 on B cells<sup>37</sup>. So, the binding of C4b-coated self-antigens by immature self-reactive B cells through the CR2–CD19–CD81 co-receptor and the cognate BCR would deliver an enhanced negative signal and promote elimination of the B cell. Alternatively, FDC uptake of C4b-coated antigen through CR2 (or a novel C4 receptor, such as human CR1L) would provide a mechanism for enhancing antigen encounter by self-reactive B cells that are at the immature stage.
C4 or CR1 and CR2, but not C3, led to a partial loss in B-cell anergy²⁶. One possible explanation for these results is that, in the absence of C4 or its receptor (CR1), the encounter with self-antigen is not sufficient to eliminate the developing autoreactive B cell, and it escapes negative selection (FIG. 2b and BOX 2). One of the known roles of C4 in the humoral immune response is the binding of environmental antigens and, through its interaction with CR1, the retention of these antigens on follicular dendritic cells (BOX 2). Interestingly, deficiency in C3 did not alter normal B-cell anergy, which is in accordance with observations indicating that deficiency in C3 is not an important susceptibility factor for SLE. Notably, although deficiency in C4 led to a partial loss of B-cell anergy, Clq does not seem to be required for full anergy in the HEL-transgenic model⁵¹. One possible explanation for this is that there are differences in the age and strain background of the Clq-deficient double-transgenic mice and the C4-deficient double-transgenic mice. Alternatively, it is possible that C4 functions independently of Clq in the HEL-transgenic model. For example, as discussed earlier, C4 can be activated by either the classical (Clq-dependent) or lectin (Clq-independent) complement pathways⁵² (BOX 1).

A potential problem with generalizing about SLE using the results obtained from the HEL-transgenic model is that the requirement for innate immunity probably varies with the nature of the antigen and the way in which it is recognized. For example, when the model self-antigen — in this case, HEL — is expressed at the surface of cells, HEL-specific B cells are deleted rather than anergized⁵⁰. By contrast, expression of a cytoplasmic form of HEL in the HEL-specific immunoglobulin-transgenic mice seems to lead to an absence of negative selection and an expansion of the population of B1 cells⁵³. Whether the innate immune system is involved in either of these models has not been determined. SLE antigens reside mainly in the nucleus and, presumably, are exposed after the release of apoptotic blebs from dying cells. In this context, the requirement for innate immunity could markedly differ between SLE and the HEL-transgenic mouse model. However, given the known roles of SAP, Clq, C4 and natural IgM in the recognition and binding of chromatin and/or DNA, as described for the clearance hypothesis, it seems reasonable that these molecules could also participate in enhancing the availability of antigen for immature B cells that are undergoing selection either in the bone marrow or in the splenic compartment.

**Figure 2 | Hypotheses for the association of SLE with genetic deficiencies.** Genetic deficiency in components of the innate immune system — such as complement component 1q (C1q), C4, serum amyloid protein, natural IgM or complement receptor 2 (CR2) — leads to increased susceptibility to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Two general hypotheses have been proposed to explain the genetic association with disease. **a** | The clearance hypothesis states that failure to clear apoptotic bodies — a principal source of SLE antigens — leads to inappropriate activation of mature, self-reactive B and T cells. Accordingly, apoptotic bodies are usually sequestered from the adaptive immune system by efficient recognition, binding and uptake by components of the innate immune system. So, SLE antigens are effectively ‘hidden’ from self-reactive lymphocytes. Defects in clearance of apoptotic bodies, such as those that occur in the absence of C1q or C4, would lead to the exposure of self-antigens to autoreactive lymphocytes and the development of SLE. **b** | The tolerance hypothesis states that innate immunity is important in the negative selection of self-reactive lymphocytes, especially B cells that are specific for SLE antigens. The innate immune pathway functions to recognize, degrade and bind SLE antigens to stromal cells present in the bone marrow and spleen. Immature B cells that encounter concentrations of cognate antigen above a certain threshold are negatively selected; that is, they undergo receptor editing, clonal deletion or anergy. C1q and C4 function to enhance ‘presentation’ of SLE antigens to specific immature B cells in the bone marrow. Alternatively, coupling of C4b to self-antigen could result in co-receptor stimulation of immature B cells displaying the CR1–CD19–CD81 co-receptor. The co-receptor is expressed at the surface of immature B cells during transitional stages in the spleen, in which co-ligation with the B-cell receptor could result in enhanced negative selection and ‘escape’ of self-reactive B cells into the peripheral mature compartment, where they encounter SLE antigens and become activated.

![Self-reactive vs Non-self-reactive](attachment:self_non_self_reactive.png)

Inherent in Burnet’s clonal-selection hypothesis<sup>67</sup> was the prediction that lymphocytes displaying self-antigen-specific receptors are eliminated during development to prevent autoimmune disease. Since Burnet put forward this proposal, evidence has accumulated that lymphocytes are required to pass multiple check-points to eliminate or anergize self-reactive cells<sup>68</sup>. Self-reactive B cells undergo receptor editing or clonal deletion in the bone marrow (see figure). Further counter-selection of self-reactive immature B cells occurs in the spleen, resulting in either anergy or clonal deletion. Studies indicate that the strength of the signal through the B-cell receptor, the environment and the form of self-antigen mainly determine the fate of the B cell<sup>50,69–72</sup>. B cells develop in the bone marrow in a linear, stage-specific manner. Immature B cells are biased towards self-reactivity<sup>73,74</sup>; therefore, many are sensitive to encounter with cognate antigen<sup>75</sup> (step 1). Surviving B cells leave the bone marrow and are required to pass a second check-point in the spleen (step 2). Here, encounter with self-antigen results in clonal deletion or anergy. Immature B cells migrating into the spleen first express complement receptor 1 (CR1) and CR2 co-receptor complexes, which could enhance negative selection or encounter with self-antigen. Mature B cells are further regulated against activation by encounter with self-antigen through the FAS pathway (also known as the CD95 pathway) (step 3). Finally, activated B cells that enter the germinal centre undergo further negative selection (step 4). Although the mechanism(s) are not clear, B cells that mutate towards self-reactivity are eliminated by clonal deletion.

Conclusions and future directions

Are there other explanations for the loss of B-cell regulation in SLE? One explanation could be that both of the hypotheses discussed here are partially correct. The combination of increased presence of SLE antigens (that is, apoptotic debris) and escape of B-cell tolerance could have a considerable effect on inappropriate encounter of antigen and activation of self-reactive B cells. This ‘combined’ hypothesis is not mutually exclusive of other contributing factors, such as TLRs<sup>54</sup>.

In summary, the observation in both humans and mice that deficiencies in the innate immune components involved in binding, uptake and clearance of apoptotic debris predispose individuals to SLE is striking and provides important clues. Two general hypotheses are considered that provide a general framework for predictions using immunoglobulin-transgenic mouse models. However, irrespective of which hypothesis is correct, it will be important to explore the use of relevant innate immune components as possible therapies to restore the normal balance of innate immune clearance mechanisms and B-cell regulation.
