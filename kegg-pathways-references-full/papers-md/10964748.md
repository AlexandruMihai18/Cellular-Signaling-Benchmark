Neurite growth and guidance depends on the transduction of extracellular guidance cues into motile responses by the sensory apparatus at the tip of the neurite, the growth cone. Contact of the growth cone with extracellular ligands leads to the cytoskeletal reorganisation required for changes in rate of motility and direction of outgrowth. Differential adhesion mediated by cell adhesion molecules and signal transduction pathways mediated by growth cone receptors were once seen as separate but cooperative events in controlling growth cone motility. However, recent findings suggest that cell adhesion molecules can activate novel signalling pathways in the growth cone by the recruitment of fibroblast growth factor receptors leading to neurite outgrowth. This Review focuses on work by various laboratories centering on the intracellular consequences of the cell adhesion molecule-mediated activation of the fibroblast growth factor receptor. These include activation of a lipase cascade including phospholipase C and diacylglycerol lipase and culminating in the release of arachidonic acid. This release of arachidonic acid is proposed to activate the transient opening of voltage-dependent ion-channels leading to localised rises in growth Ca²⁺. Recent findings demonstrating this previously undetectable rise in Ca²⁺ in the growth cone are discussed in light of the proposed roles and mechanisms of Ca²⁺ in controlling neurite outgrowth. The Ca²⁺ rises are thought to induce the activation of GAP43 and Ca²⁺/calmodulin-dependent kinase II, molecules implicated in the modulation of cytoskeletal remodelling. The evidence that this pathway may be involved in the guidance of retinal ganglion cells is evaluated.

THE GROWTH CONE IS THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM FOR THE MIGRATING NEURITE

The development of the nervous system requires the precise formation of connections between billions of spatially distant neurons. During this process, neurons must extend processes, often over considerable distances and via highly precise pathways toward their targets. This involves the progression of the motile sensory structure at the tip of the growing neurite, the growth cone, through the intervening cellular environment. This structure continuously senses whether it is on the right track, through contact with molecular cues in the immediate environment, and modulates its rate and direction of outgrowth appropriately.

The growth cone structure is perfectly adapted to the role of transducing multiple extracellular signals into the dynamic changes in the cytoskeleton associated with direction-specific motility (1). It is a dynamic, actin-rich structure, with a high membrane surface area which results in the characteristic cone shape seen in culture conditions (Fig. 1). At the leading edge of an advancing growth cone, dynamic structures consisting of long-actin-rich spikes, filopodia, and thin, flat veils called lamellapodia are found. The needle-like filopodia of the advancing growth cone extend radially ahead of the main structure, encountering molecular cues before the lamellapodia and the main body of the growth cone. It is believed that by cell adhesion mole-

cules (CAMs) present on the filopodia and lamellapodia they can mediate selective adhesion to the surrounding environment. In addition, these structures are rich in receptors and can thus respond to appropriate ligands by initiating signal transduction mechanisms, and consequent changes in motility, in a manner largely autonomous to the rest of the growth cone. An elegant indication of this property was the demonstration that individual filopodia separated from growth cones in culture by being cut, were capable of responding to a range of signalling agents including neurotransmitters with rises in cytoplasmic calcium ([Ca²⁺]i) concentrations (2). The large surface area, and the partially autonomous activity of individual regions of lamellapodia and filopodia means that the growth cone can sample a relatively large area of the environment ahead of the neurite for positive or negative growth cues. Consequently, selective portions of the growth cone can respond differentially to such signals leading to a steering movement in the presence of a gradient or boundary of guidance cues encountered. Thus, if a portion of a growth cone encounters an area containing positive cues that portion will extend filopodia in that direction by the a number of coordinated cytoskeletal events which result in the increase of filamentous actin and subsequent membrane protrusion in that area. If the gradient in the positive cues is great enough across the growth cone, the asymmetric filamentous actin production on one side of the growth cone results in an acceleration of growth in that particular direction.

The mechanisms by which the growth cone can sense its environment and transduce that information into an appropriate motile response are of great interest in developmental and neuroregenerative studies. This Review will centre on a model proposed for one type of neurite outgrowth promoting agent, typified by the cell adhesion molecules NCAM, N-cadherin and L1. It will describe one of the most fully elucidated signal transduction mechanisms leading to neurite outgrowth proposed to date. Finally it will discuss how the highly localised nature of the signalling mechanisms is consistent with the transduction of localised guidance cues in sub portions of the growth cone.

THE CELL ADHESION MOLECULES NCAM, N-CADHERIN AND L1 CAN UTILISE THE FIBROBLAST GROWTH FACTOR RECEPTOR TO MEDIATE A NEURITE OUTGROWTH RESPONSE

A wide range of ligands and receptors have been identified, to date, to mediate the promotion of growth resulting in a turning response toward the guidance cue. Such responses require that the signalling processes that occur in response to an extracellular ligand remain restricted to the portions of the growth cone closest to that signal.

FIG. 1. The tip of an extending neurite, the growth cone can sense uniform or gradient distributions of guidance cues and respond with changes in the rate and direction of extension. (a) When a growth cone encounters a uniform concentration of a positive growth signal, the whole growth cone responds resulting in acceleration of growth. The needle-like sensory filopodia and intervening lamellapodia tend to be evenly distributed. (b) When a positive gradient is encountered, the lamellapodia and filopodia on the portion closest to the signal protrude at a greater rate than the rest of the structure.

cone motility and neurite outgrowth. These include the Netrins (3-5), nerve growth factor receptors (6) and fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs) (7), receptor tyrosine phosphatases (8, 9), integrins (10) and a number of CAMs including NCAM, N-cadherin, and L1 (reviewed in (11, 12).

Classical models of the structure and function of outgrowth promoting molecules found on neurons suggest that they could be divided into two main classes. The first being catalytically active receptors which could modulate growth cone function by the mediation of intracellular signalling pathways leading to cytoskeletal reorganisation and thus enhanced motility. The second class being the CAMs which functioned to modulate neurite progression through contact mediated adhesion leading to preferential growth in areas where appropriate ligands for the CAMs were found. The model for CAMs was based on the knowledge that they do not possess catalytic domains and clearly functioned in many systems promoting adhesion through either heterophilic or homophilic interactions. It is now clear that such a model for CAM mediated outgrowth is incomplete in that adhesion by CAMs is not sufficient or necessary for promotion of neurite extension and guidance in a number of systems studied (13, 14).

Early culture models which demonstrated the ability of CAMs such as NCAM or L1 to act as neurite outgrowth promoting ligands involved growing neurons on purified CAMs or on fibroblast monolayers transfected with CAMs (15). Such systems although versatile, did not preclude a simple adhesive role for the CAMs in the outgrowth response. However, early evidence to the contrary came from the finding that NCAM and L1 mediated neurite outgrowth could be perturbed or mimicked by the inhibition or activation of cell signalling elements indicating that these CAMs were capable of activating signal transduction pathways in neurons which were necessary for outgrowth (16-19). The pharmacological inhibitors used pointed strongly to the activation of a receptor tyrosine kinase which in turn activated a pathway leading to Ca²⁺ influx and the activation of signalling molecules capable of modulating cytoskeletal structure. Subsequent demonstration that the extracellular domains of CAMs expressed as soluble Fc chimeric proteins could also mediate a neurite outgrowth response when added to the growth medium of neurons, further indicated the importance of non-adhesion-based signalling in their effect (13).

The most remarkable breakthrough was the realisation through protein sequence analysis that NCAM, L1 and N-cadherin each contain a short sequence in their extracellular regions which are homologous to sequences found in a single 20 amino acid portion of the FGFR extracellular domain (20). The short sequence found on N-cadherin had previously been implicated in N-cadherin homophilic binding immediately suggesting that CAMs may directly interact with the FGFR and modulate its activity (21, 22).

A model has emerged whereby this portion of the FGFR termed the CAM homology domain has been proposed to act as a binding site for these CAMs when found on the same cell (reviewed in detail in (12, 23-26). When a growth cone containing the FGFR and NCAM, N-cadherin or L1 comes into contact with another cell containing one of these CAMs a classical trans, homophilic interaction occurs between the CAMs on each cell (Fig. 2). This in turn causes clustering of the CAMs and, by the CAM homology domain interaction, co-clusters FGFR molecules together allowing initiation of the classic receptor tyrosine kinase activation mechanism. In this model, the activation of the FGFR is independent of its classical ligand FGF. The paradigm that the FGFR is required for CAM signalling in neurite outgrowth and that these CAMs can directly interact with and activate the FGFR via the CAM homology domain on the receptor is supported by the following findings. Treatment of neurons with NCAM or L1 induces phosphorylation of FGFR1, which is not observed on cells containing a dominant negative form of FGFR1 (27). Neurons expressing a dominant negative form of the FGFR1 do not extend neurites in response to NCAM, L1 or N-cadherin whereas outgrowth known to be independent of the FGFR is unaffected (27). Antibodies raised to the CAM homology domain portion of the FGFR inhibit neurite outgrowth in response to L1, N-cadherin and NCAM (20). Peptides corresponding to either the L1, NCAM or N-cadherin portions of the CAM homology domain on the FGFR were capable of selectively inhibiting neurite outgrowth in response to the appropriated CAM presumably by competing for the CAM/FGFR interaction (20). Together these results suggest a novel and direct interaction between the FGFR1 and CAMs which is sufficient to mediate neurite outgrowth.

CAM/FGFR ACTIVATION STIMULATES SIGNALLING PATHWAYS LEADING TO Ca²⁺ INFLUX

An early indication that CAMs activate signal transduction pathways came from the observation that CAM dependent neurite outgrowth (but not adhesion) could be inhibited by voltage gated Ca²⁺ channel inhibitors (20). In addition, CAM-mediated outgrowth could be mimicked by the activation of second messengers culminating in Ca²⁺ influx, either by the Ca²⁺ channel agonist BAY K8644 or by K⁺ mediated depolarisation (17, 20). From this indirect demonstration of the requirement and sufficiency of Ca²⁺ influx for CAM-mediated neurite outgrowth, it was established that production of the signalling lipid arachidonic acid in response to FGF or CAMs could stimulate outgrowth in a Ca²⁺-dependent manner (28). A number of mechanisms

nisms have been characterised which lead to the release of arachidonic acid from phospholipids. The most studied involves the direct cleavage activity of phospholipaseA₂ at the sn-2 position of the phospholipid where arachidonic acid (AA) is mostly found (29). However phospholipaseA₂ was not found to be involved in the CAM/FGFR neurite outgrowth response based on the insensitivity of the response to phospholipaseA₂ inhibitors (28).

Other mechanisms independent of phospholipaseA₂ have been shown to result in the liberation of arachidonic acid (30). One such mechanism, demonstrated in neuronal cultures and synaptosomes involves the initial activation of phospholipase C (PLC) which acts on phospholipids to produce a free phosphorylated head-group and diacylglycerol (DAG) (31, 32). While DAG was initially characterised as a ligand activator of protein kinase C it can also be further metabolised by lipases to produce other signalling molecules. DAG can act as a substrate for DAG lipase, liberating a fatty acid and leaving monoacylglycerol (MAG). However, it appears that DAG lipase in fact acts at the sn-1 position of the DAG producing MAG which still contains the esterified arachidonic acid at the sn-2 position (33, 34). Subsequent lipase activity by the relatively uncharacterised enzyme, MAG lipase results in the release of arachidonic acid. This pathway has been observed or inferred in a number of cell types either by direct analysis of phospholipid metabolism or by the use of the DAG lipase specific inhibitor RHC-80267 (31–33). This pathway has been implicated in the neurite outgrowth response activated by CAM/FGF signaling in the following manner.

When the FGFR becomes activated it becomes tyrosine phosphorylated on multiple residues on the cytoplasmic domain (35). When phosphorylated, the region containing tyrosine 766 acts as a binding site for the γ isoform of PLC, resulting in membrane localisation and activation of the enzyme (36). Both CAMs and FGF were shown to stimulate activation of PLCγ activity (37). The introduction of a cell permeable phopeptide designed to compete for the interaction of PLCγ with the FGFR inhibited CAM/FGFR mediated PLCγ activation and resultant neurite outgrowth (37). RHC-80267, an inhibitor of DAG lipase, an enzyme involved in the multi-step release of arachidonic acid, was capable of specifically inhibiting the CAM response, but not that of the neurite outgrowth stimulus related by laminin indicating a role of DAG production in the CAM response rather than in generalised neurite outgrowth mechanisms (28). Finally exogenous addition of arachidonic acid, or melitin, an agonist leading to release of arachidonic acid were both able to elicit a neurite outgrowth response which was sensitive to the inhibition of Ca²⁺ influx (28).

These findings provide evidence for a novel role for the PLC/DAG lipase pathway of arachidonic acid release in a cellular response, namely the mediation of a motile response of growth cones to extracellular agonists. Since the initial implications of this pathway in the modulation of growth cone motility in rat cerebellar culture, it has been further implicated in the motility of Xenopus retinal ganglion cells extending *in vivo* toward their target (38, 39), the optic tectum, in a manner again proposed to be mediated by a CAM (in this case N-cadherin)/FGFR activation.

Finally, while the CAM/FGFR pathway has to date been identified only in neuronal systems, a potential nonneuronal example has been identified. This is where DAG lipase activity has been proposed to be required for the motility of breast carcinoma cells expressing N-cadherin (40). The result observed in the carcinoma cells is interesting as a potential first example of the link between CAMs, DAG lipase and motility in nonneuronal cells, although while the authors do speculate that that the FGFR may be involved, significantly more evidence is required.

THE MECHANISM OF Ca²⁺ INFLUX MEDIATED BY CAM/FGFR INTERACTIONS

The implication of Ca²⁺ mobilisation in the neurite outgrowth response to CAMs is not unexpected in light of the many studies which demonstrate changes in growth cone Ca²⁺ levels in response to neuritogenic agents. Studies in other cell types have demonstrated that Ca²⁺ can regulate a plethora of signalling molecules that in turn can directly interact with and modulate cytoskeletal reorganisation. While there is consensus that Ca²⁺ is a central modulator of growth cone motility, it is there the consensus ends.

Different studies have proposed that Ca²⁺ either inhibits or promotes growth cone progression and neurite outgrowth. It has been speculated that depending on

the concentration of the Ca²⁺ mobilised in response to a signal it can transduce either growth promoting, or growth inhibiting signals (41). To further complicate matters an intriguing finding indicates that Ca²⁺ waves are generated in the growth cone in response to some neuritogenic signals and it is the frequency rather than amplitude of these waves that largely defines the resultant effect of the Ca²⁺ rises (42).

As in the cell body, Ca²⁺ increases in the growth cone can occur both by release from intracellular stores and by influx from the extracellular space through ion channels. The initial studies on CAM/FGF mediated signalling indicated that Ca²⁺ influx through voltage gated ion channels was both necessary and sufficient for the outgrowth response. However despite a thorough pharmacological characterisation of the Ca²⁺ influx, direct visualisation of an increase in [Ca²⁺]i was not observed (17). This lead to the proposal that the CAMs mediated transient opening of the ion channels resulting in localised sub-membrane increases in Ca²⁺ rather than large bulk Ca²⁺ changes throughout the whole growth cone.

It was not until the work of Archer et al. (1999) that confirmation of this hypothesis was obtained. This group was also unable to observe bulk Ca²⁺ rises in neurons in response to either L1 or FGF as measured by Fura-2 fluorescent techniques. However, they employed an alternative indication of Ca²⁺ channel opening. This exploits the fact that barium ions will readily pass through open Ca²⁺ channels but do not become sequestered by Ca²⁺ATPases and will as a consequence accumulate in the cytoplasm. In this way, even very transient influxes will result in accumulation of barium, which can be detected by the fluorescence microscopy in a manner analogous to the detection of Ca²⁺. Using this method, a voltage gated ion channel opening was indeed seen in response to FGF and L1. These increases were seen to be primarily due to L-type and N-type Ca²⁺ channels and were not observed in cells containing a dominant-negative FGFR or in cells treated with the DAG lipase inhibitor. This further confirms the canonical CAM/FGF pathway in the activation of Ca²⁺ channel activation.

To further implicate the generation of short lived and highly localised Ca²⁺ rises in the CAM/FGFR response, these workers examined the effect of the two cell permeable Ca²⁺ chelators EGTA-AM and BAPTA-AM on the neurite outgrowth. Both of these chelators have a similar affinity for Ca²⁺ but EGTA binds Ca²⁺ at a much slower rate. As such it has been proposed that in the event of a rapid and localised increase in Ca²⁺ the EGTA will not sequester the Ca²⁺ at a high enough rate to abolish the signal. Using this approach, BAPTA-AM but not EGTA-AM treatment of cells resulted in abolition of FGF mediated neurite outgrowth by the BAPTA but not EGTA indicating the likelihood of localised Ca²⁺ increases being involved.

The concept of physiologically relevant signalling via highly localised and transient rises in Ca²⁺ has gained much currency in the last few years. While conventional Ca²⁺ imaging techniques do not appear sensitive enough to detect them, such signalling events are in principal quite likely. For instance it is known that there is approximately a 20000-fold difference in concentration of free Ca²⁺ between the cytoplasm and the extracellular space. This results in a high rate of influx of Ca²⁺ even when channels are open for a very short length of time. However, the cytoplasm is highly enriched in relatively immobile Ca²⁺ chelating proteins, so much so, that while the total concentration of Ca²⁺ in the cytoplasm of resting cells may be as high as 1 mM, the free concentration is generally less than 100 nM. This results in a highly buffered environment that slows down diffusion of the Ca²⁺ allowing the formation of the microdomains of elevated Ca²⁺ around a transiently open channel and any associated signalling proteins. Two recent studies elegantly demonstrate that localised and transient elevations of Ca²⁺ in the growth cone are sufficient to positively modulate growth cone motility (43, 44). Both studies introduced photolabile caged Ca²⁺ into neurons and then activated a transient and localised release of the Ca²⁺ in the growth cone or nascent axon by exposing a small portion of these structures to flashes of high frequency light. In the first study extensions of new filopodia were seen within minutes of the transient elevation of Ca²⁺ within the area where the Ca²⁺ was uncaged. These filopodia eventually retracted in the absence of further Ca²⁺ mobilisation (44). In the second study a similar method demonstrated a rapid turning response toward a local Ca²⁺ rise triggered on one side of a growth cone by this photolysis method (43). Interestingly, the attractive response to such a focal increase in Ca²⁺ could be altered to a repulsive or growth inhibitory response if bulk Ca²⁺ in the growth cone was lowered using intracellular chelators. This lead the author to speculate that Ca²⁺ signalling can have both stimulatory and inhibitory effects on growth cone motility in different circumstances. Together, these papers corroborate the finding that the physiological mobilisation of localised Ca²⁺ as seen in response to arachidonic acid is sufficient to generate an outgrowth response.

Several interesting questions arise from the implication of arachidonic acid in the activation of Ca²⁺ influx. The most immediate being how does the liberation of arachidonic acid result in Ca²⁺ channel activation? The possibility that there may be an intermediate step between arachidonic acid liberation and the atypical activation of the channels observed has not been ruled out in these studies. Previous studies on the effect of arachidonic acid on L-type Ca²⁺ channels has shown an inhibitory effect on the opening of these channels in response to depolarising agonists which appears to argue against the agonistic effect of arachidonic acid in

this model. However the opening effect observed in the study described above is atypical in that depolarisation is not involved, leading the authors to propose that the effect may be due to direct interaction of arachidonic acid with the channel leading to an increase at resting voltages of the likelihood of the channels flickering open (45). The proposal that arachidonic acid may be able to influence voltage-gated Ca²⁺ channel opening by direct interaction is an intriguing one with many implications for both lipid and Ca²⁺ signalling mechanisms, and as such further characterisation of this phenomenon will be of great interest.

Ca²⁺/CALMODULIN DEPENDENT PROTEIN KINASE AND GAP43—POTENTIAL LINKS BETWEEN SIGNAL TRANSDUCTION AND THE CYTOSKELETON

To date, two signalling molecules have been described as being downstream of the Ca²⁺ influx mediated by the CAM/FGFR pathway. The first, Ca²⁺/Calmodulin dependent protein kinase II is the most abundant protein kinase in the brain (46). It is modulated by interacting with the signalling mediator, calmodulin which only becomes capable of the interaction with CaM kinase II when bound to Ca²⁺ ions. Upon binding of Ca²⁺/calmodulin, CaM kinase II becomes activated, autophosphorylates and becomes independent of calmodulin for activity. Thus, in principal, a transient activation of calmodulin by localised Ca²⁺ influx could result in a longer-term kinase response from CaM kinase II.

CaM kinase II was implicated in the CAM/FGFR pathway downstream of Ca²⁺ influx by use of the inhibitor, KN-62 which is proposed to act by preventing the interaction of calmodulin with CaM kinase II (47). CaM kinase is not universally required for outgrowth as KN-62 was ineffective in preventing outgrowth in neurons grown on laminin, fibroblast monolayers, or by the addition of the neurite outgrowth promoting agent cholera toxin which activates protein kinase A.

CaM kinase II has been previously shown to stimulate neurite outgrowth and growth cone motility when over expressed in neuronal cell lines (48), demonstrating that its activation is sufficient to mediate such a response. However, little is known about the specific targets of this kinase that result in the actin and microtubule rearrangements required for growth cone motility.

The second molecule identified as being activated in response to CAM/FGFR mediated Ca²⁺ influx is the axonal/growth cone protein GAP43. The earliest indication that GAP43 is involved in axonal guidance was the observation that its expression correlated with neurite outgrowth during development and regeneration following nerve injury (49). In addition, the over-expression of GAP43 in transgenic mice produces increased levels of nerve sprouting (50). Evidence that GAP43 may in fact mediate the ability of growth cones to reorganise the cytoskeleton in response to guidance cues rather than promoting neurite elongation per se came from studies in GAP43 knockout mice. By studying the route that retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons take during development, RGC mistargeting phenotypes were seen in GAP43 knockout mice suggesting a guidance role for GAP43 (51). Normally, RGCs project their axons from the retina into the optic tract, the vast majority in mice then crossing the midline to make highly ordered connections with their ultimate target area within the opposite hemisphere of the brain. In GAP43 knockout mice the RGC axons largely fail to make the appropriate decision once they reach the crossover point and seem to randomly route into either optic tract. This indicates that *in vivo* the absence of GAP43 does not in itself prevent outgrowth as a significant proportion of the RGC axons do project into their target area albeit in a randomised fashion, and that GAP43 may be involved in localised growth cone turning responses in response to guidance molecules. Interestingly the phenotype of the GAP43 knockout is similar to that seen in flies with disrupting calmodulin constructs expressed in subsets of CNS axons (52) suggesting a possible functional connection between these two molecules.

In the growth cone GAP43 is myristolated which results in its membrane localisation and has been reported to directly associate with and modulate the stabilisation of actin filaments (53). When unphosphorylated, GAP43 associates with calmodulin in a manner that has been proposed to sequester the molecule in an inactive state at the membrane (54). In response to agonists GAP43 can be phosphorylated on Serine 41 by protein kinase C which results in the release of calmodulin. This event, in tandem with Ca²⁺ rises should allow the mediation of signalling by both the GAP43 and the effector molecules of calmodulin, i.e., CaM kinase II.

The initial evidence for a role for GAP43 in CAM/FGFR signalling was demonstrated by the lack of neurite outgrowth promotion by either FGF or NCAM in cerebellar granule cells from GAP43 knock out animals (55). In addition, phosphorylation of Ser41 on GAP43 was induced in response to FGF in neuronal cultures and NCAM in neuronal cultures or purified growth cone preparations. This phosphorylation was not observed in growth cone preparations from FGF receptor dominant negative expressing transgenic mice indicating the requirement of the FGFR for the effect. In addition, the effect could be mimicked by the addition of arachidonic acid and was sensitive to FGFR antibodies or inhibitors of PLCγ and DAG lipase.

It is interesting to note that this study was the first to demonstrably localise the complete pathway to the growth cone as each of the major signalling steps could

be invoked in the FGF or NCAM mediated phosphorylation of GAP43 in isolated growth cone preparations. The roles of GAP43 and CaM kinase II in neurite outgrowth or guidance have not been further elucidated. It is likely that protein kinase C activity phosphorylates GAP43 thus cooperatively acting with Ca²⁺ influx to cause the localised release of calmodulin, its association with Ca²⁺ and subsequent activation of CaM kinase II. The phosphorylated GAP43 may well have actions on other downstream signalling pathways as well as modulating actin remodelling itself.

As previously mentioned, Ca²⁺ rises in the growth cone can result in the inhibition of outgrowth in certain circumstances. In particular, Ca²⁺ oscillations have been implicated in such an effect in a manner dependent on their periodicity, where the rate of neurite elongation is inversely proportional to the frequency of the Ca²⁺ rises (41). A recent study has implicated the Ca²⁺/calmodulin dependent phosphatase, calcineurin in the inhibitory response mediated by Ca²⁺ oscillations (56). The activation of this phosphatase was shown to result in the dephosphorylation of GAP43 which in turn was proposed to result in the decrease in neurite extension. This finding suggests the possibility that the phosphorylation of GAP43 may represent one point of integration of positive and negative Ca²⁺ based signals in neurite outgrowth.

CONCLUSIONS

This Review describes a signal transduction pathway elicited by a subset of neurite outgrowth promoting agents, the cell adhesion molecules NCAM, N-cadherin and L1. It is characterised by a number of novel mechanisms including the exploitation by these adhesion molecules of the signal mediating capability of the FGFR1. Secondly, this pathway demonstrates the first example of a DAG lipase mediated release of arachidonic acid mediating a profound cellular response such as neurite outgrowth. Thirdly, a model is presented where by CAMs can mediate the highly localised signalling in regions of the growth cone necessary for the ability of the growth cone to turn in response to guidance signals. This is by the generation of transient microdomains of elevated Ca²⁺ at the plasma membrane which in turn can activate the cytoskeletal remodelling mediators GAP43/CaM kinase II, in principal leading to increased accumulation of filamentous actin and thus growth in that direction. Finally the mechanism by which arachidonic acid may directly activate the transient activation of the Ca²⁺ channels if substantiated would represent a novel functional interaction between arachidonic acid and Ca²⁺ signalling mechanisms with implications outside neuronal function. The pathway described here was predominantly established *in vitro* by exposing neurons to uniform concentrations of CAMs either in solution or as substrata

which results in the equal exposure of all parts of the growth cone to the growth promoting agonist. As expected this causes accelerated growth cone motility and thus increased outgrowth. It is surmised that in areas of the developing nervous system, uniform distribution of the ligands for the CAM/FGFR on neurons, i.e., CAMs or FGF will have a similar effect. However, CAMs and FGF are also found in restricted expression patterns in the nervous system. This, in combination with the proposal that CAM signalling responses can be localised to small areas of the growth cone in a manner that should be able to initiate a turning of the growth cone when exposed to a non-uniform distribution of CAM or FGF, suggests the possible role of the CAM response in guidance.

Initial support of such a hypothesis has come in a study where RGC were initially shown to respond to L1 or NCAM by neurite outgrowth using the canonical CAM/FGFR pathway. However, when whole retina was cultured in a range of the inhibitors known to modulate the pathway (FGFR antibody, RHC-80267 or KN-62) growth of the axons was not demonstrably inhibited. However, the orderly progression of early RGC toward the exit point from the retina, the optic fissure, was disrupted with severe breakdown of the characteristic bundling seen and subsequent randomised migration of the axons. This indicates a possible guidance role for the CAM/FGFR mechanism. In the light of such work further studies of the role of the CAM/FGFR pathway in the context of neuritogenesis *in vivo* needs to be carried out to obtain a clearer picture of the role of these cell adhesion molecules in the stereo specific formation of the nervous system.
