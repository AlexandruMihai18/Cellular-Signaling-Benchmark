How chemokines invite leukocytes to dance

Marcus Thelen<sup>1</sup> & Jens V Stein<sup>2</sup>

A prominent activity of the chemokine system is the regulation of leukocyte trafficking. Here we summarize recent findings on the initial steps in chemokine receptor-induced signal transduction in leukocytes. In particular, we discuss the potential influences of the formation of oligomers of ligand and receptor and of coupling between chemokine signals and regulators of the cytoskeleton, such as small GTPases.

Leukocytes marginate from the bloodstream and follow surface-bound chemokine gradients by a process called ‘haptotaxis’, which allows them to reach their destinations at sites of inflammation and during normal homing to lymphoid organs. Locally produced fully soluble chemokines are retained by means of basic amino acid motifs that mediate high-affinity binding to surface-expressed glycosaminoglycans and prevent dispersion. Presentation of chemokines on the luminal side of vessel walls is achieved by apical secretion or by transcytosis. CXCL8, for example, is taken up at the basal side of endothelial cells and is transported through endothelial cells, presumably by the Duffy antigen receptor for chemokines (DARC)<sup>1,2</sup>.

Despite its transporter activity, DARC also functions as a ‘decoy’ receptor (also called scavenger or interceptor)<sup>3,4</sup>. Decoys (DARC, D6 and CCX-CKR), through constitutive cycling from the plasma membrane to endosomal compartments, bind and internalize chemokines without inducing cellular responses and are important for the clearance of chemokines at inflammatory sites. Studies of zebrafish suggest that CXCR7, a nonsignaling receptor with high affinity for CXCL12 (refs. 5,6), also has scavenger activity that promotes the formation of gradients for primordial germ cell migration<sup>7</sup>. CCR7 seems to have dual functions, as CCR7 also triggers cell migration and scavenges. After being stimulated with CCL21, CCR7 undergoes agonist-induced internalization and recycles to the cell surface after having dispatched the chemokine cargo to the lysosomal degradation pathway<sup>8</sup>. Thus, different mechanisms contribute to the formation and maintenance of the chemotactic gradients responsible for leukocyte trafficking.

Chemokines and receptors: two to tango?

The simplest view of cell activation by chemokines would begin with the binding of a monomeric chemokine to its cognate monomeric G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). However, several lines of evidence indicate that the situation is more complex. Chemokines may form oligomers, and chemokine receptor activity is modulated by cellular context, aggregation state and possibly membrane microdomains. Convincing evidence exists that a chemokine monomer is sufficient to bind and activate a chemokine receptor. Surface plasmon resonance and other methods show that at physiological concentrations, chemokines, which share considerable tertiary structure homology commonly called the ‘chemokine fold’<sup>9</sup>, are monomeric. *In vitro* studies have shown that chemically obligate monomers have high affinity for their cognate receptors and induce efficient leukocyte responses<sup>10,11</sup>. Nevertheless, *in vivo* data indicate that for some chemokines, such as CCL2, CCL4, CCL5 and CXCL10, the formation of oligomers enhances leukocyte recruitment<sup>12,13</sup>. At higher concentrations, chemokines can spontaneously form dimers or higher-order structures. The formation of dimers by CC chemokines occurs through their amino termini and involves the two cysteine residues, whereas the first β-strand is used to assemble extended β-sheets of CXC chemokines that give rise to entities with very different structures<sup>9</sup>. At chemokine-rich sites of inflammation, it is furthermore conceivable that chemokines undergo the formation of heteromers. Studies have shown that such heteromeric chemokines have considerable synergism, strongly enhancing leukocyte migration and activation<sup>14–16</sup>. The inflammatory chemokine CXCL8, for example, can potentiate responses induced by CCL2 and CXCL12, which act on CCR1 and CXCR4, respectively, but not of CCL21, which triggers responses through CCR7. The biochemical mechanisms underpinning this synergism are poorly understood.

The aggregation state of chemokine receptors and its relevance to receptor biological activity is more complex, and conflicting observations have been published. The idea that signal transduction among GPCRs varies considerably and that a single receptor can alter its signaling capacities depending on the cellular context and the bound ligand make any generalization about the aggregation state superfluous. It is instead necessary to evaluate receptor responsiveness case by case. All biochemical methods used to demonstrate the formation of homodimers or heterodimers have strengths and limitations (Supplementary Information online). The existence of GPCR dimers is not a matter of debate; in fact, the small group of class C GPCRs, which includes GABA receptors, metabotropic glutamate receptors and calcium-sensing receptors, are obligatory dimers. Chemokine receptors, however, belong to the larger subgroup of rhodopsin-like class A GPCRs, and convincing evidence is available demonstrating that a monomer can mediate G protein activation<sup>17</sup>. Models of a two-step chemokine-receptor binding allow the interaction of a monomeric ligand with a single receptor unit (‘protomer’)<sup>18,19</sup>. Such models assume docking of the chemokine to the extracellular amino terminus of the receptor, followed by receptor activation. Triggering of the receptor is mediated by the

Figure 1 Stages of CCL19-induced T cell polarization. Exposure of human T cells to a homogeneous concentration of CCL19 leads to the rapid formation of various F-actin-rich protrusions (lamellipodia; orange), one of which eventually becomes stabilized. Afterward, a morphologically defined uropod (green) forms, yielding fully polarized cells. Adapted from ref. 71.

thus result in an apparently smaller number of binding sites (such as CCR2-CCR5 or CCR2-CXCR4)³¹. However, it should be kept in mind that this phenomenon should have been reported in studies that have exploited chemokine receptor desensitization to show the specificity of a chemokine for its respective receptor on primary cells. From such studies, it has been concluded that ligands of CCR2, CXCR4 and CCR5 act independently on their specific receptors without affecting the responsiveness of other receptors. If a substantial percentage of a surface-expressed chemokine receptor forms stable heterodimers, the two receptor pools would be expected to internalize together and the internalization of one would be expected to result in less responsiveness to the partner receptor. Accordingly, C5aR and CCR5 expressed on rat basophilic leukemia RBL cells internalize together after stimulation³². However, such cointernalization of chemokine receptors has not been found in leukocytes or in cells overexpressing receptors. Thus, it seems that chemokine receptors are prevalently expressed as constitutive homodimers at the cell surface, but the existence of heterodimers is less clear.

### Turning on chemokine receptors

Depletion of cholesterol from membranes reversibly attenuates chemokine binding and abrogates chemokine receptor signaling. Although such observations are in agreement with the assumption that chemokine receptors reside in membrane rafts, the precise function of cholesterol might be more subtle. Crystallization of the β-adrenergic receptor has demonstrated the presence of cholesterol at the receptor dimer interface³³, and the inclusion of cholesterol derivatives increases the binding of CXCL12 to solubilized CXCR4³⁴–³⁶. Thus, it is difficult to determine if the importance of cholesterol reflects a requirement for the association of chemokine receptors with rafts or a requirement for membrane cholesterol in maintaining the receptors in an active conformation. CXCR1 segregates into lipid rafts after stimulation, which suggests that rafts are not required for ligand binding. Alternatively, ligand-induced partitioning of chemokine receptors into lipid rafts could indicate that in resting cells, the receptors move into and out of the microdomains and chemokines stabilize the association with rafts³⁷,³⁸.

GPCR activation seems not to follow an induced-fit mechanism but is instead mediated though the stabilization of ‘flickering’ or transient receptor conformations³⁹,⁴⁰. Such a view can be deduced from the more general view that predicts proteins can interconvert between different (active) conformations. The existence of multiple active receptor states adds even more diversity to GPCR-mediated signaling³⁹. For example, depending on the chemokine with which it is stimulated, CCR2 presumably assumes different receptor active states that ‘translate’ into distinct cellular responses. CCL2 acts as a typical chemokine agonist, whereas CCL11-induced signaling is antagonistic. Both chemokines trigger intracellular signal transduction, although through different pathways, such as the selective activation of distinct isoforms of phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI(3)K)⁴¹.

### Gi coupling: a dogmatic paradigm at its limits?

Coupling of chemotactic receptors to heterotrimeric Gi proteins seems to occur in almost all hematopoietic cells, as most ligand-induced signaling events are suppressed after treatment with pertussis toxin, which uncouples Gi proteins from GPCRs⁴². After receptor activation, the α-and βγ-subunits of G protein dissociate to activate ‘downstream’ pathways, in which the βγ-complex is critical in regulating cell migration⁴³. It seems that Gαi subunits are solely responsible for chemokine receptor signaling in leukocytes⁴⁴. Coupling of chemokine receptors to G proteins other than of the Gi subclass has been shown, but these results have been obtained with artificial transfection systems in the absence of Gi proteins. Research indicates that CXCR4- and CCR7-dependent chemotaxis of
dendritic cells (DCs) but not of naive lymphocytes requires, in addition to G<sub>i</sub>, the activation of a G<sub>q</sub>-dependent pathway<sup>45</sup>. This finding emphasizes the importance of cellular context in chemokine receptor signaling. However, it is not clear if CXCR4 and CCR7 directly couple to G<sub>q</sub> in DCs or whether the G protein is part of a secondary, CD38-dependent pathway. Kinetic analyses of calcium mobilization and the absolute sensitivity to pertussis toxin suggest a hierarchical arrangement in which G<sub>i</sub> acts 'upstream' of G<sub>q</sub>. Notably, inhibition of G<sub>i</sub> proteins in neutrophil-like HL-60 cells only partially blocks G<sub>12/13</sub>- and G<sub>q</sub>-dependent activation of the GTPase Rho and uropod formation<sup>46</sup>. Also, chemokine receptors such as CCR5 and CXCR4, which are recruited to the immunological synapse in T cells, have been proposed to switch coupling from G<sub>i</sub> to G<sub>q</sub> and/or G<sub>11</sub> proteins and thus lose their ability to trigger chemotaxis<sup>47</sup>. In general, the mechanisms by which chemokine receptors couple to G proteins other than G<sub>i</sub> and their relationship with the classical pathways need to be worked out in more detail.

### Scaffolds: necessary elements for divergent signaling?

The phosphorylation and internalization of chemokine receptors are insensitive to pertussis toxin and thus are independent of G protein coupling. This indicates that chemokine receptors couple not only to G proteins but also to additional proteins such as G protein receptor kinases<sup>42</sup>. The formation of receptor dimers provides a platform for increasing the number of molecules able to bind GPCRs without steric hindrance<sup>17</sup>. Scaffolds such as arrestins and PDZ domain–containing proteins modulate the signaling capacity of GPCRs and provide binding sites for additional effector proteins. Filamin A clusters CCR5 and CXCR4 with the coreceptor CD4, thus facilitating infection with human immunodeficiency virus<sup>48</sup>. In addition, filamins act as signal ‘integrators’ by binding to many proteins involved in motility<sup>49</sup>. FROUNT is essential for CCR2-dependent migration<sup>50</sup>, and the E3 ligase AIP4 mediates ubiquitination and lysosomal sorting of CXCR4 (ref. 51). HIP is a molecular chaperone that may modulate the chemotactic responsiveness of CXCR2 and CXCR4 (ref. 52). Understanding of the various signaling networks that associate with chemokine receptors is only beginning. Coupling to selective pathways does not question the importance of signaling events long established as being ‘downstream’ of chemokine receptors (such as calcium flux and activation of PI(3)K, protein kinase B (PKB; also called Akt) and the kinase Erk)<sup>42</sup> but may provide a means for ‘fine tuning’ cellular responses.

### Signal or no signal?

By and large, when receptors are expressed at the cell surface, it is assumed that they respond to their specific ligands. Nevertheless, several chemokine receptors that normally trigger chemotaxis or mobilize calcium fail to demonstrate these responses depending on their cellular environment. CXCR4, which is continuously expressed during all stages of B cell maturation, fails to induce calcium mobilization or the chemotaxis of mature peripheral blood CD19<sup>+</sup> cells but activates the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway and triggers receptor internalization<sup>34,53</sup>. Mature DCs express the homing receptor CCR7 but migrate poorly in response to CCL19 and CCL21 without prior exposure to prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> (ref. 54). DC maturation is associated with downregulation of the inflammatory chemokine receptors CCR1, CCR2 and CCR5 and upregulation of CCR7. In the presence of the Toll-like receptor ligand lipopolysaccharide and the cytokine interleukin 10, this ‘switch’ in chemokine receptor expression is blocked, but the inflammatory receptors are nevertheless unable to stimulate cell migration and instead act as scavengers<sup>55</sup>. The biochemical mechanisms which govern the uncoupling of receptors from ‘downstream’ pathways are not understood at present.

When fully functional, agonist-engaged chemokine receptors induce rapid activation of integrins as well as polarization and motility. In recirculating lymphocytes, rapid, ‘subsecond’ integrin activation takes place inside blood vessels such as high endothelial venules, whereas polarization and motility occurs after firm adhesion and during transmigration. Naive lymphocytes are continuously motile in lymphoid tissue, where they spend most of their lifespan<sup>56–58</sup>. Notably, although ‘crawling’ of leukocytes on endothelial surfaces under shear stress (such as force of blood flow) is integrin dependent<sup>59,60</sup> and B cell entry into splenic white pulp is much lower in absence of functional α<sub>4</sub> and β<sub>2</sub> integrins<sup>61</sup>, T cell migration in lymphoid tissue is mostly independent of β<sub>2</sub> and α<sub>4</sub> integrin<sup>62</sup>. Such findings reflect earlier studies of three-dimensional collagen lattices<sup>63</sup> (Supplementary Information). Furthermore, DCs lacking all surface integrins migrate efficiently through peripheral tissues toward draining lymph nodes<sup>64</sup>. Thus, lymphocyte migration in lymphoid tissues does not absolutely require integrin activity. It is unclear at present whether this new paradigm also applies to leukocyte migration at effector sites.

#### Downstream of chemokine receptors

The intracellular pathways involved in chemokine-induced integrin activation have been reviewed and will be discussed here only briefly<sup>65,66</sup>. Chemokine receptors stimulate rapid activation of phospholipase C via the βγ-subunits released from Gα<sub>i2</sub> proteins; this elicits calcium mobilization and diacylglycerol production<sup>42</sup> and, in turn, induces activation of the Rap1 guanine nucleotide-exchange factor (GEF) CalDAG-GEFI (also called RasGRP2)<sup>67</sup>. Rap1-GTP mediates rapid integrin activation (less than 1 second) and subsequent cell polarization (within 30–180 seconds)<sup>65,66</sup>. A final step in integrin activation is the binding of talin to the β-chain of integrins to stabilize a high-affinity confirmation<sup>68</sup>. Data also support the idea of a central function for the binding of kindlin-3 to β<sub>3</sub> integrin during integrin activation in platelets<sup>69</sup>. Further characterization of the interactions among Rap, talin and kindlin-3 will be useful.

Cell polarization is a prerequisite for efficient migration<sup>70</sup>. Chemokines break the symmetry of blood-borne cells by promoting the formation of an anterior-posterior axis, with asymmetrical distribution of extracellular and intracellular molecules in the leading edge and the trailing edge, or uropod. Leukocyte polarization is a rapid cellular response to exposure to a uniform concentration of chemokines or to a gradient<sup>71–73</sup>. *In vitro*, polarization in response to a uniform chemokine concentration can be categorized into sequential steps. CCL19-stimulated human lymphocytes first form various lamellipodia, one of which becomes stabilized after around 30 seconds. During the next minute, a uropod forms opposite the leading edge and a definite anterior-posterior axis is established<sup>71</sup> (Fig. 1).

The establishment of polarity requires the concerted action of many intracellular signaling modules, in particular members of the Rho and Ras families of small GTPases. Generally, it seems that a given small GTPase triggers similar effector functions in almost all leukocyte subsets. Rap is important for integrin activation and induction of polarity, whereas Rac induces lamellipodia formation. Rho is involved in integrin activation and uropod contraction, whereas Cdc42 promotes the stabilization of a leading edge and directed motility. Some small GTPases are expressed in various isoforms, which may explain in part some reported cell type-specific responses. Perhaps more notably, the activity of these regulators of the actin cytoskeleton is under the control of many GEFs and GTPase-activating proteins, which are expressed in a subset-specific and developmentally specific way.

Expression of constitutively active Rap1 is sufficient to induce a polarized phenotype in lymphoid cell lines but expression of Rho, Rac or Cdc42 is not<sup>74,75</sup>. The molecular pathways leading to polarization are incompletely understood; however, dominant negative isoforms of Cdc42 and Rac inhibit Rap1-induced polarization, which suggests that Rap1 acts through these small GTPases and perhaps other effectors<sup>75</sup>. In polarized
DOCK2-mediated lymphocyte migration. Instead, PI(3)K activity leads to DOCK2-independent chemokine-induced F-actin formation and chemotaxis in both T cells and B cells^{73,85}. In T cells, residual migration depends on class I_B PI(3)Kγ, whereas B cells engage the class I_A PI(3)Kδ and perhaps other isoforms^{73,85}. Thus, naive T cells lacking both DOCK2 and PI(3)Kγ show almost no migration in response to CCL21 (ref. 73), whereas B cells lacking DOCK2 and PI(3)Kδ show no residual responsiveness to CXCL13 (J.V.S., unpublished observations). The observation that class I_A and I_B kinases are involved in the chemotaxis of B cells and T cells, respectively, suggests that they are activated by a common mechanism (such as RasGTP)^{86,87} or are 'tied' into different signaling cascades because of their different modes of activation. The relative contributions of DOCK2 and PI(3)K to migration may also depend on specific chemokine receptors, signaling strength and cellular activation status. For example, PI(3)Kγ has a central function in the migration of CD8⁺ effector T cells toward leukotriene B₄ and CCL5 but not toward CCL21 (ref. 88).

The Rac GEFs involved in PI(3)K-dependent chemokine-induced F-actin formation, polarization and migration are unknown at present. In a T cell line overexpressing a dominant negative isoform of the GEF Vav1, defective migration toward CXCL12 has been shown; however, perhaps because of compensation by other Vav isoforms, Vav1-deficient cells show normal migration^89. A report has linked the pleckstrin homology domain-containing Tec kinase Itk to the recruitment and activation of Vav, as Itk-deficient CD4⁺ T cells show less migration *in vitro* toward homeostatic chemokines^90. It is thus possible that PI(3)K promotes Tec kinase activation, although this hypothesis needs to be addressed experimentally.

The Rac GEF Tiam1 also acts during chemokine-induced T cell migration. Tiam1 associates with Par3 and protein kinase C-ζ (PKC-ζ), members of the Par polarity complex, which segregate to the leading edge in polarized cells and therefore help to establish or stabilize the anterior-posterior axis^{75,91}. Notably, Tiam1 becomes activated 'downstream' of Rap1 and Cdc42 activation^75, and inhibition of PKC-ζ does not affect initial F-actin formation but does affect subsequent polarization^71. It is thus possible that Tiam1 acts subsequent to DOCK2 during stabilization of the leading edge–uropod formation after an initial F-actin 'boost' (*Fig.2*). In this model, DOCK2 would be sufficient to promote migration toward strong stimuli, such as CCR7 ligands and other promigratory factors present in lymphoid tissue. When the chemoattractant signal is weak, additional PI(3)K-dependent Rac GEFs, possibly members of the Vav family, are required for efficient polarization. After a primary DOCK2- and PI(3) K-dependent F-actin formation, Tiam1 may be recruited to the leading edge, where it contributes, together with Par proteins, to the establishment of polarity. Of note, Tiam1- or PKC-ζ-deficient mice have normal lymphoid structure and cellularity, in contrast to DOCK2- or Gα_i2-deficient mice. This indicates that this pathway is partially redundant with other promigratory signaling modules.

In B cells, the Rac-, F-actin- and PtdIns(3,4,5)P_3-binding protein SWAP-70 participates in events after adhesion that lead to efficient transmigration through high endothelial venules^92. Although chemokine-induced Rac1-GTP quantities, F-actin formation and *in vitro* chemotaxis are normal in SWAP-70-deficient B cells, these cells show less polarization and leading edge stability when spreading on the integrin ligands ICAM-1, VCAM-1 or MAdCAM-1 (ref. 92). Whether the T cell homolog SLAT (SWAP-70-like adaptor of T cells) has a comparable function during T cell homing is not known.

The function of the Rac-Cdc42 GEF α-PIX in lymphocyte migration has also been addressed. In contrast to its effect on the chemotaxis of neutrophils (discussed below), the absence of α-PIX results in enhanced lymphocyte chemotaxis toward CXCL12 *in vitro*^93, which suggests that optimal migration requires a balance of various Rac GEF activities. Little

Figure 2 Early and late intracellular signaling modules that lead to the polarization and migration of naive T cells. Chemokine stimulation induces a very fast increase (less than 5 seconds) in intracellular F-actin, which is mediated by DOCK2 in lymphocytes and additional Rac GEFs in other leukocyte subsets. A second PI(3)K-dependent Rac GEF, possibly Vav, is also activated, although its contribution is minor relative to that of DOCK2. Rap-GTP induces, through incompletely understood mechanisms, Cdc42 activation, the assembly of a Par3-Par6-Cdc42-GTP complex and PKC-ζ activation. The Rac GEF Tiam1 is also recruited to the complex, where it may contribute to stabilization of the leading edge. The 'preferential' recruitment of the Par complex to one of the various early lamellipodia may help to define the position of the definite leading edge. The actin assembly factor mDia1 is also important during the chemotaxis of T cells but not B cells. Finally, Ras-GTP is also rapidly formed after CCR7 stimulation in primary mouse T cells (J.V.S., unpublished observations). Its function is unknown at present but may relate to the costimulatory effect on T cell receptor signaling of CCL21 or PI(3)K activation. MLC-p, phosphorylated myosin light chain.

cells, the Rap effector RapL localizes together with the integrin LFA-1 at the leading edge^76. RapL binds to and activates the serine-threonine kinase MstI, which is also found at the leading edge in migrating cells^77. As integrins are not required for lymphocyte migration in lymph node interstitium^62,64, the mechanisms by which RapL and MstI contribute to cell polarity and motility are not well understood. Notably, in lymphoid cell lines, most of the cellular pool of RapL and MstI is located in peri-nuclear vesicles, which are mobilized to the leading edge after stimulation of chemokine receptors^77.

### Rac GEFs influencing lymphocyte migration

Polarization and migration also requires rapid Rac-driven new formation of F-actin at the leading edge^64. In naive T cells and B cells, an early wave of chemokine-induced F-actin formation (less than 5 seconds) is initiated by the Rac GEF DOCK2 after binding of the adaptor molecule ELMO. DOCK2-deficient lymphocytes, but not monocytes, have less chemokine-induced F-actin formation, cell polarity and *in vitro* migration^78. Likewise, the interstitial motility of DOCK2-deficient T cells and B cells in lymphoid tissue is much lower^79. Similar to results obtained with pertussis toxin-treated or Gα_i2-deficient lymphocytes^80–82, the absence of DOCK2 affects interstitial T cell motility more severely than does the absence of CXCR4 and/or CCR7 (refs. 81–83), which suggests that DOCK2 acts 'downstream' of additional G_iα-coupled receptors activated by factors present in lymphoid tissue.

Although DOCK2 contains a phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P_3)-binding domain^84, PI(3)K activity is dispensable for

**Rac GEFs in neutrophils: common participants; different game**

Comparison of the Rac-activation pathways in neutrophils and lymphocytes shows how Rac may be differently regulated by either subset-specific Rac GEFs or cell-specific molecular ‘wiring’ of Rac GEF signaling networks. P-Rex1 is a Rac GEF that is abundant in neutrophils and monocytes but not lymphocytes (M.T. and J.V.S., unpublished observation); it becomes activated by simultaneous binding of Gβγ and PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>. P-Rex1 thus acts as a ‘coincidence detector’ and contributes to rapid activation of Rac2 and, to a lesser degree, Rac1 (refs. 94,95). Regardless of the abundance of P-Rex1 in neutrophils, P-Rex1-deficient cells show only slightly diminished chemotaxis, despite having slightly less early formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLF)-induced F-actin formation<sup>94,95</sup>. The defective migration is due to lower migration speed, whereas directionality is not affected.

DOCK2 also contributes to fMLF-induced F-actin formation in neutrophils, albeit by different mechanisms than those in lymphocytes. First, DOCK2 contributes to delayed F-actin formation after a rapid DOCK2-independent increase in F-actin. Second, DOCK2 recruitment requires PI(3)K activity, in contrast to the situation in lymphocytes, through the DHR1 domain of DOCK2, which directly binds PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> (ref. 84). The greater sensitivity of neutrophil chemotaxis to PI(3)K inhibition relative to that of lymphocytes may thus be related to the regulation of two Rac GEFs, P-Rex1 and DOCK2, by PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>. However, some PI(3)K-independent Rac GEFs probably contribute to neutrophil migration<sup>96–98</sup>, as PI(3)K accelerates the initial response to fMLF but over time an alternative pathway replaces PI(3)K<sup>99</sup>. These findings may explain observations indicating that PI(3)K can be dispensable in neutrophil migration<sup>100</sup>.

Activation of neutrophil GPCRs related to chemokine receptors, such as FP-R or C5aR, results in recruitment of the kinase PAK1 through interactions with Gβγ subunits. PAK1, in turn, recruits α-PIX, which activates Cdc42, an ‘upstream’ regulator of PAK1 activity. These interactions thus create a positive feedback loop that stabilizes the leading edge and allows efficient translocation. In addition, α-PIX is required for exclusion of the tumor suppressor PTEN from the leading edge and for PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> accumulation<sup>101</sup>. Thus, in contrast to its function in T cells and B cells, α-PIX has a promigratory function during neutrophil chemotaxis.

Whereas Rac activity is localized mainly at the leading edge, Rho activity is localized to the uropod<sup>102</sup>. Studies of neutrophil-like cell lines have shown activation of Rho through Gα<sub>12</sub> and Gα<sub>13</sub> and PDZ-RhoGEF-dependent pathways<sup>46</sup>. RhoA, through its ‘downstream’ effector ROCK, regulates activity of the nonmuscle myosin heavy chain IIA and uropod contraction<sup>103</sup>. Pharmacological inhibition of the Rho kinase ROCK inhibits lymphoblast chemotaxis toward CCR7 ligands when relatively small pore sizes are used<sup>104</sup>, in line with the involvement of RhoA in lymphocyte uropod retraction. This retraction seems necessary to ‘squeeze’ the nucleus through restricted spaces and also requires myosin IIA heavy chain<sup>64,102,103</sup>. Whether RhoA-mediated uropod retraction is also involved during interstitial lymphocyte motility has not been addressed thus far.

T cells, chemotaxis toward CCL19 *in vitro* has been shown to be approximately 30–50% lower for CD4<sup>+</sup> cells and 80% lower for CD8<sup>+</sup> cells<sup>107,108</sup>, although CCR7 expression was not measured. Similarly lower chemotaxis of WASP-deficient DCs and granulocytes toward CCL19 and fMLF, respectively, has also been reported<sup>108</sup>. In contrast to migration toward CCR7 ligands, migration toward CXCL12 is normal in WASP-deficient T cells but is impaired in T cells lacking the WASP-interacting protein WIP<sup>109</sup>. No studies have thus far reported the migratory phenotype of WASP, N-WASP or WIP-deficient lymphocytes in lymphoid tissue.

The WAVE proteins (also called Scar) are closely related WASP family members and act ‘downstream’ of Rac-GTP to bind and activate the Arp2/3 complex<sup>106</sup>. Of the three WAVE isoforms (WAVE1–WAVE3), mouse lymphoid tissue has high expression of the ubiquitous WAVE2 isoform but only minor expression of WAVE3 (ref. 106). Whereas WAVE2 regulates lamellipodial F-actin formation in fibroblasts in a PI(3)K- and Erk-dependent way<sup>110,111</sup>, lymphocytes probably use different WAVE2 regulatory pathways. However, because of the embryonic lethality of WAVE2 deficiency in mice, this has not been addressed experimentally thus far.

Formins are actin-assembly factors that act ‘downstream’ of RhoA-GTP. In contrast to Arp2/3, which creates branched actin networks, formins generate elongated actin filaments. Lack of the lymphocyte-expressed formin isoform mDia1 leads to impaired *in vitro* chemotaxis in T cells but not in B cells<sup>112,113</sup>, concomitant with less chemokine-induced F-actin formation in T cells<sup>113</sup>. The interaction between Arp2/3 and mDia1 in leukocytes needs to be explored further.

**Concluding remarks**

Chemokines trigger receptor monomers or dimers to activate context-specific signaling pathways through small GTPases and actin cytoskeleton modulation. An important task will be to link findings obtained with different experimental systems, taking into account receptor conformations, signal strength and kinetic parameters, as well as post-translational modifications of various GEFs, GTPase-activating proteins and other effectors of small GTPases, to establish leukocyte subtype-specific and activation state-specific signaling networks. The functions of these networks must be examined in physiological models of migration, perhaps in combination with multiphoton microscopy or other imaging techniques. In addition, future experiments will need to address the function of chemokine-induced vesicle transport in the generation and maintenance of polarity. Another interesting yet little studied field in leukocyte motility is the function of phospholipase A<sub>2</sub>-dependent migration, which is complementary to PI(3)K signals in monocytes and dictyostelium<sup>114–116</sup>, and the function of tyrosine kinases during chemokine receptor signaling. Clearly, there is still much to be learned about chemokine-induced signaling pathways.
