Abstract
Aldosterone increases within 30 min renal Na⁺ reabsorption and K⁺ secretion by a mechanism that is triggered at the level of gene transcription. Thus, gene products that are rapidly up- or down-regulated transmit this effect to the transport machinery within the distal nephron target cells. One such rapidly up-regulated gene product is a structural element of the transport machinery, namely the α subunit of ENaC. Its amount might in certain conditions play a rate limiting role for Na⁺ transport. Cell-surface localization and function of ENaC and of the Na,K-ATPase are also tightly controlled by a complex regulatory network and aldosterone appears to acutely regulate the expression of elements of this network such as the small G-protein K-Ras (in A6 cells) and the kinase SGK1 (also in ENaC-expressing cells of the mammalian distal nephron). The kinase SGK1 is an early aldosterone-induced protein that relays signals from pathways that are transmitted via PDK1/2 and possibly PKA. Active SGK1 has been shown to increase ENaC and Na,K-ATPase cell-surface expression in Xenopus oocytes. This effect at the level of ENaC has been recently shown to be mediated by the ubiquitin ligase Nedd4-2 which is a direct target of SGK1. Once phosphorylated by SGK1, Nedd4-2 is prevented from interacting with ENaC and thus from decreasing ENaC cell-surface expression. This SGK1-Nedd4-2-ENaC pathway is the first direct link between aldosterone-induced transcriptional regulation and the function of the Na⁺ transport machinery to be unravelled. The physiological importance of this pathway for mediating the aldosterone response in different target epithelia remains to be verified *in vivo*, in particular in view of the axial gradient of ENaC apical translocation observed along the aldosterone-sensitive distal nephron.

Short-term physiological action of aldosterone

Aldosterone plays an important role in the long-term adaptation of its target epithelial cells under conditions of high Na⁺ reabsorption requirements, such as in low salt diet conditions [1]. A high aldosterone plasma concentration indeed leads to an increase in target cell basolateral membrane area and mitochondria content that are prerequisites for a high Na⁺ reabsorption capacity [2, 3].

Aldosterone also plays an important role in the short-term adaptation to salt and fluid loss or intake and in the context of the circadian rhythm [4]. This is made possible by the relatively short half-life of plasma aldosterone that allows acute changes in its concentration. For instance, an acute increase in aldosterone concentration within physiological levels leads already within less than 30 min to an increase in Na⁺ reabsorption and K⁺ secretion [5, 6]. Because the effect of aldosterone on Na⁺ transport depends on ongoing transcription and translation, this rapid physiological response appears to be mediated by gene products the expression of which is rapidly regulated at the transcriptional level.

In the ASDN, aldosterone rapidly induces αENaC and increases the surface expression of ENaC and of the Na,K-ATPase

The kidney aldosterone target cells are localized in the distal part of the kidney nephron, namely the second part of the distal convoluted tubule (late DCT), the connecting tubule (CNT) and the collecting duct (aldosterone-sensitive distal nephron = ASDN) [7]. Their Na⁺ transport machinery is composed of the apical, amiloride-sensitive, epithelial Na⁺ channel that represents the highly regulated Na⁺ influx pathway through the luminal membrane, and the Na,K-ATPase that pumps Na⁺ ions basolaterally out of the cells and thereby provides the driving force for apical Na⁺ influx. The apical K⁺ channel ROMK plays an important role by mediating the secretion of K⁺, maintaining thereby the membrane potential that drives Na⁺ influx [1].

We have recently demonstrated that aldosterone indeed acts in the short term on ENaC expression and localization *in vivo* [7]. On the one hand, it rapidly increases ENaC α subunit amount at the mRNA and protein levels all along the ASDN (large effect within 2 hours) (Figure 1). On the other hand, it promotes a concerted change of ENaC α, β and γ subunit subcellular localization from an intracellular compartment to the apical pole. This latter effect is slightly slower and, in our experimental conditions, restricted to proximal segments of the ASDN (late DCT and CNT).

Concomitantly, the cell-surface expression of the Na,K-ATPase is also regulated by aldosterone. We have recently shown in collaboration with Eric Feraille that the amount of Na,K-ATPase expressed at the cell surface of rat cortical collecting duct cells increases several fold within less than 3 hours, whereas the total amount of this pump increases only slightly in this short term [8]. The effect of aldosterone on Na,K-ATPase cell-surface expression could be reproduced qualitatively in a cell culture system (mpkCCD). In this model, we could demonstrate the independence of this effect on apical Na⁺ influx via ENaC and its dependence on ongoing transcription and translation.

In summary, aldosterone acts both on the amount of cellular Na⁺ channels and pumps, but only the change in channel amount (α subunit) might play a rate limiting role in the short term. In contrast, the increase in Na⁺ pump quantity is a long term effect, although it is initiated rapidly [7, 9]. An important short-term action of aldosterone is the stimulation of cell-surface expression of both Na⁺ transport proteins [7, 8]. In the case of ENaC, this short-term translocation was visualized by immunofluorescence and shown to be restricted to proximal segments of the ASDN (late DCT and CNT), indicating that other factors that follow an axial gradient along the ASDN are also required for allowing ENaC cell-surface expression. Recently, Nielsen et al. showed that, unlike the induction of αENaC, the apical translocation of the channel in response to long-term dietary Na⁺ restriction is not prevented by the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) antagonist spironolactone, indicating that MR-independent effects can suffice to support ENaC cell-surface expression [10].

Aldosterone-induced gene products that may control the function of the Na⁺ transport machinery

Based on the time-course and transcription dependence of the aldosterone response, we assumed that we

Thin arrows indicate regulatory pathways the importance of which appears to be established in the context of Na⁺ reabsorption.

Note the regulatory pathway that links the transcriptional regulation of SGK1 to the cell-surface expression of ENaC via Nedd4-2.

should find among the rapidly aldosterone-regulated gene products those that regulate the Na⁺ transport machinery in the short term. Among the adrenal-steroid upregulated RNAs (ASUR) that we identified by differential display PCR in a cell culture model (A6 cells from Xenopus laevis), there was one coding for K-Ras2A [11]. We showed that this small G-protein increases the function of ENaC, relative to its surface expression level, in the Xenopus oocyte expression system [12]. Later experiments performed in the laboratory of Doug Eaton strongly suggested that K-Ras2A plays an important role in the regulatory network that controls ENaC function in A6 cells [13].

Another aldosterone-induced protein that appears to act on the function of the Na⁺ transport machinery in some segments of the ASDN is CHIF. This small protein was shown to be an accessory subunit of the Na,K-ATPase that can modulate the Na⁺ affinity of the Na⁺ pump [14]. Originally, it was identified in the laboratory of Haim Garty as an aldosterone-induced protein in the mammalian distal colon [15].

Two short-term aldosterone-induced proteins are mentioned here that do not act directly onto the Na⁺ transport machinery but may be considered as promoting differentiation, since they repress/compete the action of transcription factors known to drive cell proliferation.
first one, Fos-related antigen Fra-2a, was identified in A6 cells and is known to antagonize the action of Fos (AP1 subunit) [16]. The second, glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipper protein GILZ, was identified in a SAGE-screen (serial analysis of gene expression) in mpkCCD cells [17]. This protein was shown to inhibit the transcription factors AP1 and NFkB by binding to the AP1 constituents Fos and Jun and to NFkB [17, 18]. Interestingly, the mRNAs of the proliferation-inducing cellular oncogene products Myc, Jun and Fos were found in A6 cells to be downregulated in a transcription and translation-independent way [16].

The serum and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase SGK1 is the aldosterone-induced regulatory protein the role of which has been the most studied. It was first identified in the laboratory of David Pearce as dexamethasone-regulated in A6 cells and shown by us to increase the current carried by ENaC upon co-expression in Xenopus oocytes [19]. Rapidly these observations were confirmed by others and the induction of SGK1 was shown to take place also in mammalian kidney and cortical collecting duct cells [19, 20].

We have recently verified by immunofluorescence that SGK1 is upregulated in the short term precisely in the aldosterone target cells of the ASDN [7]. Figure 2 shows that in adrenalectomized rats all ASDN cells display a very low SGK1 signal, whereas a single aldosterone injection specifically induces within two hours a strong signal in the cytosol of segment-specific cells (not in intercalated cells) of the entire ASDN. The intensity of this signal was already substantially decreased 2 hours later.

The short-term induction by aldosterone of SGK1 and K-Ras2A (in A6 cells), that are elements of the cellular regulatory network, suggests that aldosterone controls the effectiveness of signalling pathways by increasing the expression of key relays. Thereby, the impact of other hormones and factors that signal via this network onto the Na⁺ transport machinery, in particular on ENaC and the Na,K-ATPase, can be strengthened synergistically by aldosterone [21-23].

SGK1 kinase activity is regulated and is required for SGK1 action on ENaC and Na,K-ATPase

The kinase activity of SGK1 appears to be per se required for the stimulation of ENaC because co-expression of a kinase-dead mutant SGK1 with ENaC does not increase but even lowers the activity of ENaC in Xenopus oocytes [7, 24]. Furthermore, the inhibitory effect of the kinase dead SGK1 suggests the hypothesis that Xenopus oocytes express some SGK1-like activity that is competed by the dominant negative action of this mutant SGK1 [7].

The activity of SGK1 depends on its sequential phosphorylation by the PI3-kinase dependent PDK2, at the level of its Ser422 residue, and then by PDK1 on its Thr256 residue [25]. Thus, the activity of SGK1 can depend on the activity of pathways that stimulate PI3-kinase such as those feeding in from Insulin/IGF receptors and from growth factor receptors such as those for FGF, PDGF and HGF (via K-Ras, see above) [21, 23, 26]. The fact that PI3-kinase inhibitor LY-294002 blocks the SGK1-induced activation of ENaC in Xenopus oocytes supports the notion that PI3-kinase activity controls the stimulatory action of SGK1 on ENaC [23].

Recently, the findings in the Xenopus oocytes were confirmed by expressing SGK1 in the Xenopus renal cell line A6. SGK1 was able to stimulate transepithelial Na⁺ transport, and it was also found that kinase activity and PI-3K dependent phosphorylation was important for this stimulation [21].

PKA appears to activate SGK1 as well, at least in some cell types [26, 27]. This effect could be via a direct phosphorylation of Thr369 for which Ser422 phosphorylation would play a permissive role [28]. If such an effect was confirmed for aldosterone target cells, this would suggest a pathway by which vasopressin could act synergistically with aldosterone on ENaC via the Gs-linked V2 receptor.

SGK1 increases ENaC and Na,K-ATPase cell-surface expression in Xenopus oocytes

Antibody binding and immunofluorescence experiments have shown that the effect of SGK1 on ENaC activity in Xenopus oocytes correlates with an increase in ENaC cell-surface expression and that actually most of ENaC activation can be explained by this mechanism [7, 29-32].

The possibility that SGK1 affects the function of the Na,K-ATPase has also been tested in Xenopus oocytes. The constitutively active form of SGK1 has been shown to increase the pump current carried by the endogenous Na,K-ATPase of Xenopus oocytes [33]. We

Fig. 2. Aldosterone rapidly induces an accumulation of SGK1 and ENaC α subunit as well as a shift of ENaC α, β and γ subunits to the apical pole in connecting tubule cells. SGK1 and ENaC α, β and γ subunits were visualized by immunofluorescence in connecting tubules (part of the early ASDN) of adrenalectomized (ADX) rats and of ADX rats 2 and 4 h after a single aldosterone (aldo) injection; bar 15 μm. In ADX rats, SGK1 and αENaC are undetectable. Two hours after aldosterone injection, SGK1 and αENaC become easily detectable in the cytoplasm of CNT cells. At 4 h, all three ENaC subunits are disclosed at the apical cell side of the CNT cells and SGK1 expression is decreased. Intercalated cells do not express detectable amounts of SGK and ENaC. Modified from Loffing et al. [7].

have shown that Na,K-pumps that contain the rat α1 subunit (the isoform expressed in the kidney) were activated by wild type SGK1, whether expressed in the absence or presence of ENaC, the amiloride-inhibitable Na⁺ conductance of which was used to set the intracellular Na⁺ concentration. The increase in pump current correlated with an increase in the amount of cell surface Na,K-ATPase (Zecevic, Heitzmann and Verrey, in preparation). Thus, SGK1 might control the cell-surface expression

of Na⁺ transport proteins coordinately at both sides of epithelial cells.

The SGK1-Nedd4-2-ENaC pathway: from gene regulation to transport regulation

Nedd4-2 is a ubiquitin protein ligase that interacts in vitro and in vivo with ENaC. This interaction depends
on the presence of PY motives in the COOH-terminal region of all three subunits of ENaC to which Nedd4-2 binds via its so-called WW domains [34]. Importantly, this interaction leads to a decrease in the cell-surface expression of ENaC, as convincingly demonstrated in the Xenopus oocyte expression system [35]. This downregulatory effect depends on the ubiquitination of ENaC by Nedd4-2, as deduced from the fact that enzymatically inactive Nedd4-2 does not downregulate ENaC surface expression [35] and that ENaC devoid of the NH2-terminally localized ubiquitination sites is not downregulated [36]. The physiological importance of this regulatory mechanism is underlined by the fact that mutations of the PY domains of ENaC β and γ subunit, to which Nedd4-2 binds, are at the origin of the genetic disease called Liddle's syndrome that is characterized by hypertension due to aldosterone-independent hyperactivity of ENaC at the surface of ASDN cells [37].

Recently, one of our laboratories and others showed in expression systems that the downregulation of ENaC by Nedd4-2 is prevented by SGK1-mediated phosphorylation of Nedd4-2 [30], a finding confirmed by others [38]. Thus, the effect of SGK1 on ENaC cell-surface expression in Xenopus oocytes could be explained by an inhibition of the Nedd4-2-mediated ENaC withdrawal from the cell surface. This is an important finding, since for the first time the transcriptional action of aldosterone is linked by a continuous pathway to ENaC regulation.

also post-transcriptionally mediated induction of ENaC α subunit is so rapid that it may play an important rate limiting role also in the short-term control of ENaC activity by aldosterone [7]. The new link established between aldosterone-mediated transcriptional regulation of SGK1 and ENaC cell-surface expression, via the ubiquitin ligase Nedd4-2, represents an important new pathway between the transcriptional level of aldosterone action and the function of Na⁺ transport effectors [30].

Despite the fact that an association has been found between SGK1 polymorphisms and blood pressure, the physiological importance of the new mechanism mentioned above has to be considered in view of recent results obtained in the A6 cells (SGK1-independent aldosterone effect) and in SGK1 knockout mice (only modest pseudohypoaldosteronism) [38-41]. These data obtained in a specific amphibian model cell line and in organisms chronically devoid of SGK1 indeed suggest that there must be some redundancy in the regulatory network that links aldosterone to the Na⁺ transport machinery and that linear views of signal transduction do not suffice to describe the complexity of the system. The observation that short-term aldosterone induces an accumulation of αENaC and SGK1 in the entire ASDN, whereas the translocation of ENaC to the cell surface takes place only in its proximal segments (late DCT and CNT), indicates that other factors displaying an axial gradient along the ASDN are probably required as well to drive ENaC cell surface expression [7].

### Conclusions

As yet, the long-term action of aldosterone could be explained to some extent mechanistically by a transcriptionally-mediated effect on the transport machinery that has been observed at the level of ENaC, the Na,K-ATPase and mitochondrial proteins [1]. Very recently, we have shown that the transcriptionally and possibly
