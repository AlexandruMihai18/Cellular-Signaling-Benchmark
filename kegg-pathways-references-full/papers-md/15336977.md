## Abstract

Huntington disease (HD) is an autosomal-dominant neurodegenerative disorder that primarily affects medium spiny striatal neurons (MSN). HD is caused by polyglutamine (polyQ) expansion (exp) in the amino-terminal region of a protein huntingtin (Htt). The connection between polyQ expansion in Htt${}^{\text{exp}}$ and MSN neurodegeneration remains elusive. Here we discuss recent data that link polyQ expansion in Htt${}^{\text{exp}}$ and deranged Ca${}^{2+}$ signaling in MSN neurons. Experimental evidence indicates that (1) Ca${}^{2+}$ homeostasis is abnormal in mitochondria isolated from lymphoblasts of HD patients and from brains of the YAC72 HD mouse model; (2) Htt${}^{\text{exp}}$ leads to potentiation of NR1/NR2B NMDA receptor activity in heterologous expression systems and in MSN from YAC72 HD mouse model; and (3) Htt${}^{\text{exp}}$ binds to the type 1 inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (InsP${}_{3}$R1) carboxy-terminus and causes sensitization of InsP${}_{3}$R1 to activation by InsP${}_{3}$ in planar lipid bilayers and in MSN. Based on these results we propose that Htt${}^{\text{exp}}$-induced cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca${}^{2+}$ overload of MSN plays an important role in the pathogenesis of HD and that Ca${}^{2+}$ signaling blockers may play a beneficial role in treatment of HD.

## Huntington disease and huntingtin

Huntington disease (HD) is an autosomal-dominant neurodegenerative disorder with the age of onset between 35 and 50 years and inexorable progression to death 15–20 years after onset. The symptoms include motor abnormalities including chorea and psychiatric disturbance with gradual dementia [1]. Neuropathological analysis reveals selective and progressive neuronal loss in the striatum (caudate nucleus, putamen, and globus pallidus) [1,2]. GABAergic medium spiny striatal neurons (MSN) are the most sensitive to neuronal degeneration in HD [1,2]. At the molecular level the cause of HD is polyglutamine (polyQ) expansion in the amino-terminal of a 350 kDa evolutionary conserved cytosolic protein called huntingtin (Htt) [3]. Clinical signs of HD develop if the length of polyQ track in Htt exceeds a pathological threshold of 35Q. The CAG repeat length is inversely correlated with age of onset [4]. Htt is widely expressed in the brain and in non-neuronal tissues and not particularly enriched in the striatum [5–7]. Htt plays an essential function in development, as deletion of the Htt gene in mice is embryonic lethal [8,9]. Analysis of Htt primary sequence suggests that Htt is likely to function as a signaling scaffold [10], but the precise function of Htt in cells is not known. In order to elucidate the pathogenesis of HD, a number of transgenic HD mouse models have been generated [11,12].

The key question in HD research is how does polyQ-expanded huntingtin (Htt${}^{\text{exp}}$) kill MSN? The answer to

this question is a prerequisite to development of effective HD therapies. The HD mutation at least in part creates a “gain of function.” A number of toxic functions have been assigned to Htt<sup>exp</sup>, including effects on gene transcription, induction of apoptosis, and disruption of key neuronal functions such as proteasomal function, ubiquitination, axonal transport, endocytosis, and synaptic transmission. The evidence in favor of these hypotheses is reviewed elsewhere [11–17]. All of these models are consistent with a toxic function of Htt<sup>exp</sup> in neurons, but none of these models explain the selective vulnerability of MSN in HD. In this review we discuss recently emerging results that support the concept that HD may be a disease of deranged calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) signaling.

### Htt<sup>exp</sup> disrupts mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis

Striatal-specific defects of mitochondrial respiratory chain activity have been described in postmortem brains of HD patients and in brains from R6/2 HD mouse model [18–21]. In addition to their role in energy production and metabolism, mitochondria also play an important role in cellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis [22,23]. Mitochondria isolated from lymphoblasts of HD patients and from brains of HD YAC72 transgenic mouse models revealed pronounced defects in Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling [24]. In these experiments isolated mitochondria were challenged with repetitive applications of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and mitochondrial membrane potential (∆Ψ<sub>m</sub>) was monitored by tetraphenyl phosphonium (TPP<sup>+</sup>)-sensitive electrode. An increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup> load resulted in a sudden decrease of ∆Ψ<sub>m</sub>, indicating an opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP). When compared to mitochondria isolated from lymphoblasts of normal individuals, mitochondria from lymphoblasts of adult-onset HD patient (Htt-46Q) were less resistant to Ca<sup>2+</sup> challenge and the ∆Ψ<sub>m</sub> in HD mitochondria decreased at an earlier timepoint (Fig. 1A). The mitochondria isolated from lymphoblasts of juvenile-onset HD patient (Htt-65Q) were even more sensitive to Ca<sup>2+</sup> (Fig. 1A). In a similar manner, mitochondria from brains of YAC72 HD transgenic mouse model [25] were less resistant to Ca<sup>2+</sup> challenge than mitochondria from brains of wild type or YAC18 control mouse (Fig. 1B). The disruption of mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling was more severe in YAC72 mice expressing higher levels of Htt-72Q than in low expressors (Fig. 1B).

A portion of Htt in cells is directly associated with mitochondria [26]. The association of Htt<sup>exp</sup> with mitochondria was confirmed by electron microscopy of brain samples from YAC72 HD mouse model [24]. Thus, Htt<sup>exp</sup> may influence mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling directly, for example by forming ion channels in the mitochondrial membrane. In support of this hypothesis, mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling was shown to be disrupted in vitro in the presence of polyglutamine GST-fusion proteins containing a Q62 track, but not Q19 track (Fig. 1C).

The results of Panov et al. [24] demonstrated that mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis is disrupted in the presence of Htt<sup>exp</sup>. Importantly, observed defects occurred before motor symptoms and neurodegeneration and may therefore be an early manifestation of neuronal dysfunction. The mechanism of Htt<sup>exp</sup> action on mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling may involve direct effects on mitochondrial membrane ion permeability (Fig. 1C) or may also be mediated by other Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling systems in the cells as discussed below.

### Htt<sup>exp</sup> activates NR1/NR2B NMDAR

Glutamate activates three classes of ionotropic glutamate receptors (AMPA receptors, kainate receptors, and NMDA receptors). Activation of NMDAR results in significant Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, and overstimulation of NMDAR may lead to Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload and neuronal cell death (glutamate excitotoxicity). Several lines of evidence indicate that glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity plays a role in neurodegeneration of HD MSN. Striatal injection of kainic acid induced death of MSN and yielded one of the first animal models of HD [27,28]. Importantly, effects of kainate required the presence of corticostriatal neurons [29], suggesting that glutamate release is required for kainate-induced MSN cell death. More direct evidence for an involvement of NMDAR was obtained when HD-like lesions were observed following intra-striatal injection of the NMDAR agonist quinolinic acid [30–32].

Although these studies demonstrated that superactivation of striatal NMDAR mimics MSN degeneration as observed in HD, they did not provide a causal link between the HD mutation and NMDAR activation. This link was initially suggested in a heterologous expression system when it was demonstrated that coexpression of Htt-138Q, but not Htt-15Q, resulted in activation of NMDAR in HEK293 cells [33]. Interestingly, the potentiating effect of Htt-138Q was specific for the NR1/NR2B NMDAR subtype and not for the NR1/NR2A NMDAR subtype (Figs. 2A and B). Using the same HEK293 cell expression system it was also demonstrated that cells cotransfected with NMDAR and Htt-138Q plasmids were more sensitive to NMDA-induced apoptosis than the cells co-transfected with NMDAR and Htt-15Q or GFP (control) plasmids [34]. Similar to effects on NMDAR currents (Figs. 2A and B), potentiating effects of Htt-138Q on excitotoxic cell death were more pronounced in the presence of the NR1/NR2B NMDAR subunit combination than in the presence of the NR1/NR2A subunit combination [34]. The specificity of Htt<sup>exp</sup> effects is particularly important because MSN express predominantly NR1/NR2B NMDAR subunit combinations [35–37].

Fig. 1. Disruption of mitochondrial Ca²⁺ handling by Htt<sup>exp</sup>. (A) Ca²⁺-induced changes in mitochondrial membrane potential (∆Ψ<sub>m</sub>) were monitored in lymphoblast mitochondria from control subjects (open circles), adult-onset (Htt-46Q, solid squares), and juvenile-onset (Htt-65Q, filled circles) HD patients. (B) Ca²⁺-induced changes in mitochondrial membrane potential (∆Ψ<sub>m</sub>) were monitored in brain mitochondria from non-transgenic mouse (open circles), YAC18 transgenic mouse (half-filled squares), and YAC72 transgenic mouse (filled circles, low expressor line; filled squares, high expressor line). (C) Ca²⁺-induced changes in mitochondrial membrane potential (∆Ψ<sub>m</sub>) were monitored in normal lymphoblast mitochondria in control conditions (open circles) and in the presence of GST protein (half-filled squares), GST-Q19 protein (open squares), and GST-Q62 protein (filled circles). Panels (A)–(C) are adapted from [24].

Fig. 2. NR1/NR2B NMDAR are upregulated by Htt<sup>exp</sup>. (A) A combination of NR1 and NR2A NMDAR subunits was co-transfected into HEK293 cells together with β-gal plasmid (control), Htt-15Q, or Htt-138Q plasmids. The NMDA-induced currents in transfected cells were measured by whole-cell recordings and normalized to cell capacity. No significant differences in the size of NMDA-evoked currents were observed between three groups of cells. (B) A combination of NR1 and NR2B NMDAR subunits was co-transfected into HEK293 cells together with β-gal plasmid (control), Htt-15Q, or Htt-138Q plasmids. The NMDA-induced currents in transfected cells were measured by whole-cell and normalized to cell capacity. The size of NMDA-evoked current is significantly higher in cells co-transfected with Htt-138Q (asterisk) than in other two groups of cells. (C) The size of NMDA-evoked current in primary MSN from non-transgenic (WT) and YAC72Q (72Q) mouse. Inhibition of NMDA-evoked current by ifenprodil is shown for YAC72 mouse MSN. (D) An average NMDA-evoked peak current density in MSN from non-transgenic (WT) and the YAC72 (72Q) mouse. Panels (A) and (B) are adapted from [33]. Panels (C) and (D) are adapted from [38].

Further support for the potentiating effects of Htt<sup>exp</sup> on NMDAR activity was obtained in the analysis of the YAC72 HD mouse model [25]. NMDA-evoked currents (Figs. 2C and D) [38] and NMDA-mediated Ca²⁺ transients [39] were significantly increased in striatal neurons from the YAC72 mouse compared to wild type controls. Consistent with the HEK293 cell expression data (Figs. 2A and B), the NMDAR currents in striatal neurons potentiated in the presence of the YAC72 transgene were selectively blocked by NR1/NR2B-specific antagonist ifenprodil (Fig. 2C). Consistent with the excitotoxicity hypothesis, striatal neurons from the YAC72 mouse were sensitized to neuronal death induced by quinolinic acid and NMDA [38]. Moreover, excitotoxic cell death of YAC72 MSN was blocked by ifenprodil [38], supporting a direct involvement of NR1/NR2B NMDAR subtypes in HD.

How does Htt<sup>exp</sup> activate NMDAR? Experiments in a heterologous expression system demonstrated that Htt binds to a modular adaptor protein PSD95 and that Htt<sup>exp</sup> binds to PSD95 less strongly than Htt [40]. The PDZ domains of PSD95 bind to the carboxy-terminal

region of the NMDAR NR2 subunit. The association of PSD95 with the NR2 subunit leads to recruitment of Src tyrosine kinase, tyrosine phosphorylation of NMDAR, and an increase in NMDAR currents [41]. It was proposed that weakened association of Htt<sup>exp</sup> with PSD95 increases the pool of PSD95 available for interactions with NR2 subunits, leading to hyperphosphorylation of NMDAR by Src kinase. Consistent with this hypothesis, tyrosine hyperphosphorylation of NR2B subunits was observed in a heterologous expression system in the presence of a Htt-48Q construct [42]. Moreover, inhibition of NR2B phosphorylation by the Src tyrosine kinase inhibitor SU6656 attenuated Htt-48Q-facilitated apoptotic cell death in rat hippocampal neuronal cell line HN33 [42]. Future experiments will be needed to determine if PSD95 and Src-mediated pathway is responsible for NMDAR potentiation by Htt<sup>exp</sup> in vivo. An alternative hypothesis may involve direct or cytoskeleton-mediated effects of Htt<sup>exp</sup> on NMDAR gating or changes in NMDAR surface expression and/or localization in the presence of Htt<sup>exp</sup>.

Htt<sup>exp</sup> sensitizes InsP<sub>3</sub>R1 to InsP<sub>3</sub>

The inositol (1,4,5)-triphosphate receptor (InsP<sub>3</sub>R) is an intracellular calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) release channel that plays an important role in neuronal Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling [43]. Three isoforms of InsP<sub>3</sub>R have been identified [44]. The type 1 receptor (InsP<sub>3</sub>R1) is the predominant neuronal isoform. Mice lacking InsP<sub>3</sub>R1 display severe ataxic behavior [45], and mice with a spontaneous mutation in the *InsP<sub>3</sub>R1* gene experience convulsions and ataxia [46], suggesting a major role of InsP<sub>3</sub>R1 in neuronal function. In the search for novel InsP<sub>3</sub>R1-binding partners we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen with InsP<sub>3</sub>R1 carboxy-terminal bait and isolated Htt-associated protein 1A (HAP1A) [47]. In biochemical experiments, we demonstrated the formation of InsP<sub>3</sub>R1–HAP1A–Htt ternary complex in vitro and in vivo [47]. Interestingly, Htt was able to associate with InsP<sub>3</sub>R1 even in the absence of HAP1 protein, although with reduced affinity [47]. In planar lipid bilayer reconstitution experiments we demonstrated sensitization of InsP<sub>3</sub>R1 to InsP<sub>3</sub> in the presence of Htt-138Q amino-terminal fragment (Figs. 3A and B) or full-length Htt-82Q [47]. These effects were specific for Htt<sup>exp</sup>, as the Htt-15Q amino-terminal fragment (Figs. 3A and B) or full-length Htt-23Q [47] had no effect on InsP<sub>3</sub>R1 sensitivity to InsP<sub>3</sub>. In experiments with primary cultures of rat MSN we demonstrated facilitation of InsP<sub>3</sub>R1-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> release in the presence of Htt-82Q and Htt-138Q proteins, but not in the presence of Htt-23Q protein (Fig. 4). The ability of Htt<sup>exp</sup> to sensitize InsP<sub>3</sub>R1 to activation by InsP<sub>3</sub> correlated with the ability of Htt<sup>exp</sup>, but not Htt, to associate directly with InsP<sub>3</sub>R1 carboxyl-terminal region [47].

Fig. 3. Htt<sup>exp</sup> amino-terminal fragment sensitizes InsP<sub>3</sub>R1 to activation by InsP<sub>3</sub> in planar lipid bilayers. (A) Effects of GST, GST-Htt-N-15Q, and GST-Htt-N-138Q on the activity of recombinant InsP<sub>3</sub>R1 in planar lipid bilayers at 100 nM InsP<sub>3</sub>. Each current trace corresponds to 10 s (2 s for expanded traces) of current recording from the same experiment. (B) The average InsP<sub>3</sub>R1 open probability (*P<sub>o</sub>*) in the presence of 100 nM InsP<sub>3</sub> is calculated for a 5 s window of time and plotted for the duration of an experiment. The times of InsP<sub>3</sub>, GST, GST-Htt-N-15Q, and GST-Htt-N-138Q additions are shown. Adapted from [47].

Thus, we reasoned that potentiating effect of Htt<sup>exp</sup> on InsP<sub>3</sub>R1-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> release is due to direct association of Htt<sup>exp</sup> with InsP<sub>3</sub>R1 carboxyl-terminus.

From these results we proposed that upregulation of InsP<sub>3</sub>R1 by Htt<sup>exp</sup> may be a contributing factor to Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload and degeneration of MSN in HD [47]. MSN are highly enriched for mGluR5, a member of the group I mGluRs [48–52]. Stimulation of group I mGluR in MSN leads to the generation of InsP<sub>3</sub> and release of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (Fig. 4). The alterations in ER enzymes that have been observed in HD postmortem brains [53] are consistent with malfunction of ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling in HD MSN neurons.

Htt<sup>exp</sup> causes cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload and apoptosis of HD MSN

Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload plays a central role in apoptosis [54–57]. ER and cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels influence activity of Bcl/Bax family members and Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload of

Pseudocolor calibration scale for 340/380 ratios is shown on the right. The recordings are performed in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free ACSF containing 100 μM EGTA. GFP images (first column) were captured before Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging to identify transfected cells (arrowheads). InsP<sub>3</sub>R1-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> release is initiated by addition of 10 μM DHPG, a specific mGluR1/5 agonist. Ratio recordings are shown for DHPG-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in MSN neurons transfected with EGFP (first row), EGFP + Htt-23Q (second row), EGFP + Htt-82Q (third row), and EGFP + Htt-138Q (fourth row). The 340/380 ratio images are shown for MSN neurons 1 min before (second column), and 8 s, 30 s, 1 min, 2 min, and 3 min after application of 10 μM DHPG as indicated. Adapted from [47].

mitochondria leads to opening of the permeability transition pore (PTP) and release of cytochrome c, AIF, Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and other pro-apoptotic factors into cytoplasm. Interestingly, imaging studies suggested that Ca<sup>2+</sup> released from ER via InsP<sub>3</sub>R is preferentially accumulated in the mitochondria [23], indicating that upregulation of InsP<sub>3</sub>R1 by Htt<sup>exp</sup> [47] will be effective in inducing mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload.

Based on the data discussed in the previous sections and known link between Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload and apoptosis [54–57], we propose a model that connects Htt<sup>exp</sup> effects on mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling [24] (Fig. 1), NR1/NR2B NMDAR activity [33,38–40,42] (Fig. 2), and sensitivity of InsP<sub>3</sub>R1 to InsP<sub>3</sub> [47] (Figs. 3 and 4) with cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload and apoptosis of MSN (Fig. 5). Consistent with mitochondrial involvement is the observation of dysfunctional mitochondria in HD mouse and in HD patients [18–21,24,39] and the ability of PTP inhibitors to prevent neuronal apoptosis in MSN from YAC72 mouse model [39]. Direct effect of Htt<sup>exp</sup> on mitochondrial membrane ion permeability (Fig. 1C) may be a contributing factor in deranged Ca<sup>2+</sup> mitochondrial signaling, but it is not

likely to explain the selective vulnerability of MSN in HD. Thus, we propose that mitochondrial dysfunction in HD is secondary to NMDAR- and InsP<sub>3</sub>R1-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload of MSN (Fig. 5).

The proposed model (Fig. 5) explains some of the characteristic HD features:

(1) MSN vulnerability is due to selective and abundant NR2B [35–37] and mGluR5 [48–52] expression in the MSN.

(2) The late onset of MSN degeneration is a result of large mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> storage capacity that takes time to exceed. Meanwhile, HD neurons are dysfunctional even prior to onset of apoptotic cascade due to elevated cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels, consistent with neurological abnormalities in early-grade HD patients and in HD mouse models prior to onset of neurodegeneration.

(3) The length of polyQ expansion in Htt protein inversely correlates with the age of HD symptoms onset because longer polyQ tracks in Htt<sup>exp</sup> protein result in larger Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses (Fig. 4), with less time to mitochondrial overload. This idea is consistent with

(4) The pathological threshold of 35Q in Htt is because Htt<sup>exp</sup> with polyQ tracks longer than 35Q adopts a conformation that can directly bind to the InsP<sub>3</sub>R1 carboxyl-terminal [47] which affected the InsP<sub>3</sub>R1 gating (Figs. 3 and 4) and decreased its ability to associate with PSD95 [40] leading to NR1/NR2B NMDAR upregulation (Fig. 2).

### Future perspectives

Despite efforts by many laboratories, there is no cure for HD. Our hypothesis (Fig. 5) suggests that Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling blockers, such as NR2B-specific inhibitors of NMDAR and blockers of mGluR5 and InsP<sub>3</sub>R1, may be beneficial for the treatment of HD. Inhibitors of Htt<sup>exp</sup> association with InsP<sub>3</sub>R1 may potentially be used as a more specific HD therapeutic. These concepts are being tested in our laboratories in a YAC128 mouse model that reproduces selective late-onset MSN neurodegeneration as observed in HD [58]. When compared to inhibitors of apoptosis an advantage of using Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling blockers and inhibitors of InsP<sub>3</sub>R1-Htt<sup>exp</sup> association is that they may stop pathological process at its earliest point, before severe neuronal dysfunction triggers apoptotic cell death.

HD belongs to a family of polyQ-expansion neurodegenerative disorders [59–61]. Similar to HD, most of these diseases, such as spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA1, SCA2, SCA3/MJD1, and SCA7) and dentatorubral-lidolysian atrophy (DRPLA), are caused by polyQ-expansion in the sequence of a cytosolic protein of unknown function. Also similar to HD, these diseases are autosomal-dominant and the polyQ-expansion appear to act as “gain of function” mutation that leads to selective neuronal death of a subpopulation of neurons. It is unknown whether the effects of Htt<sup>exp</sup> on neuronal Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling are a unique feature of HD or shared by other polyQ-expansion neurodegenerative disorders. Future experiments will be needed to answer this question.
