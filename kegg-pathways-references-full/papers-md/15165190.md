## Summary

Anthocyanin acyltransferases (AATs) catalyze a regiospecific acyl transfer from acyl-CoA to the glycosyl moiety of anthocyanins, thus playing an important role in flower coloration. The known AATs are subfamily members of an acyltransferase family, the BAHD family, which play important roles in secondary metabolism in plants. Here, we describe the purification, characterization, and cDNA cloning of a novel anthocyanin malonyltransferase from scarlet sage (*Salvia splendens*) flowers. The purified enzyme (hereafter referred to as Ss5MaT2) is a monomeric 46-kDa protein that catalyzes the transfer of the malonyl group from malonyl-CoA to the 4‴-hydroxyl group of the 5-glucosyl moiety of anthocyanins. Thus, it is a malonyl-CoA:anthocyanin 5-glucoside 4‴-*O*-malonyltransferase. On the basis of the partial amino acid sequences of the purified enzyme, we isolated a cDNA that encodes an acyltransferase protein. The steady-state transcript level of the gene was the highest in recently opened, fully pigmented flowers and was also correlated with the trend observed for an AAT gene responsible for the first malonylation step during salvianin biosynthesis. Immunoprecipitation studies using antibodies against the recombinant acyltransferase protein corroborated the identity of this cDNA as that encoding Ss5MaT2. The deduced amino acid sequence of Ss5MaT2 showed a low similarity (22–24% identity) to those of AATs and lacked the AAT-specific signature sequence. A phylogenetic analysis suggested that Ss5MaT2 is more related to acetyl-CoA:benzylalcohol acetyltransferase (BEAT) rather than to AAT. This is another example in which enzymes with similar, although not identical, substrate evolved from different branches of the BAHD family.

Keywords: anthocyanin, salvianin, malonyl-CoA:anthocyanin 5-glucoside 4‴-*O*-malonyltransferase, phylogenetics, flavonoid biosynthesis, BAHD family.

## Introduction

The class of acyl-CoA-dependent acyltransferases play important roles in the secondary metabolism in plants and fungi, including some with biomedical, pharmaceutical, and agricultural importance, such as the biosynthesis of taxol (Walker and Croteau, 2000a,b; Walker *et al.*, 2000), morphine (Grothe *et al.*, 2001), anthocyanins (Fujiwara *et al.*, 1999; Suzuki *et al.*, 2001, 2002, 2004), phytoalexins (Yang *et al.*, 1997), floral scent (D’Auria *et al.*, 2002; Dudareva *et al.*, 1998), and vindoline (St-Pierre *et al.*, 1998). Although the primary structures of these acyltrans-

contains about 70 related genes of this family. However, most of the biochemical roles of these BAHD family members are yet to be determined.

Anthocyanin acyltransferases (AATs) catalyze a regiospecific acyl transfer from acyl-CoA to the glycosyl moiety of anthocyanins and play an important role in flower coloration (Nakayama *et al.*, 2003). Thus far, many AATs with different acyl donor specificity, acyl acceptor specificity, and regiospecificity with respect to acyl transfer have been cloned and sequenced. All of the known AATs are members of the BAHD family and can be further categorized into a subgroup (clade) that is phylogenetically separated from other BAHD members (Nakayama *et al.*, 2003). Indeed, all of these AATs share a specific signature sequence, -YFGNC- (motif 2), in their primary structures, which could successfully be used for the specific isolation of novel AAT genes through a homology-based strategy (Suzuki *et al.*, 2002).

In our attempts to understand the relationship between the specificity and phylogenetics of BAHD members, we have focused on the AAT activity (5MaT2 activity, see Figure 1) involved in the biosynthesis of salvianin (Suzuki *et al.*, 2001), an anthocyanin with two malonyl and one caffeoyl group, which is responsible for the scarlet coloration of *Salvia splendens* flowers. We previously reported on the cDNA cloning and characterization of malonyl-CoA:anthocyanin 5-O-glucoside-6″-O-malonyltransferase of *S.* splendens (Ss5MaT1) and showed that this enzyme exclusively catalyzes the malonylation of the 6″-hydroxyl group of bisdemalonylsalvianin to produce monodemalonylsalvianin (5MaT1 activity, Figure 1; Suzuki *et al.*, 2001). As Ss5MaT1 is not able to catalyze the subsequent malonylation of the 4‴-hydroxyl group of monodemalonylsalvianin (i.e., the second malonylation) to produce salvianin, the second malonylation is thought to be catalyzed by an enzyme (termed Ss5MaT2) that is distinct from Ss5MaT1 (Suzuki *et al.*, 2001). Thus, we undertook the cDNA cloning of Ss5MaT2 using a homology-based strategy. In spite of many attempts, however, we failed to obtain Ss5MaT2 cDNA by means of this strategy. In this study, we purified Ss5MaT2 from *S.* splendens flowers to homogeneity and characterized the cDNA obtained. Our findings revealed that Ss5MaT2 is a novel AAT that is devoid of motif 2 in its primary structure. A phylogenetic analysis showed an unusual phylogenetic position of Ss5MaT2 for an AAT, suggesting that Ss5MaT2 should be more related to acetyl-CoA:benzylalcohol acetyltransferase rather than to AAT.

### Results

#### Purification and characterization of Ss5MaT2

As the cloning of Ss5MaT2 cDNA by means of a homology-based strategy was unsuccessful (see Discussion), we purified the enzyme responsible for 5MaT2 activity in *S.* splendens flowers, characterized it, and determined its partial amino acid sequences. The enzyme was extremely unstable to oxidation and the addition of 2-mercaptoethanol was essential for its efficient purification, as was the case for Ss5MaT1. The enzyme could be purified in six steps (Table 1). Sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS–PAGE) of the purified enzyme showed a major protein band (>95% purity judging from silver staining) with an estimated molecular mass of 46 kDa. The elution profiles of 5MaT2 activity during chromatographies on ceramic hydroxyapatite (CHT-I), Superdex 200 pg, and Mono Q coincided with those of the 46-kDa protein, verifying that this 46-kDa protein was responsible for 5MaT2 activity. The native molecular mass of the purified SsMaT2 was estimated to be 45 kDa by gel filtration on a Superdex 200 pg column, indicating that the enzyme was monomeric.

Purified Ss5MaT2 effectively acted on monodemalonylsalvianin (see Table 2 for details) as well as cyanidin 3-O-(6″-O-p-coumarylglucoside)-5-O-(6″-O-malonylglucoside) (malonylshisonin; Suzuki *et al.*, 2001; relative activity, 142% of monodemalonylsalvianin under the standard assay conditions). However, it did not show 5MaT1 activity for the production of monodemalonylsalvianin when bisdemalonylsalvianin was used as a malonyl acceptor. Cyanidin 3-O-(6″-O-p-coumarylglucoside)-5-O-glucoside (shisonin; Suzuki *et al.*, 2001),

The structures of the anthocyanins are shown in their flavylium forms.

pelargonidin 3-O-glucoside, pelargonidin 3,5-O-digluco- side, and pelargonidin 3-O-(6′-O-malonylglucoside)-5-O- glucoside failed to serve as malonyl acceptors. Concerning acyl donors, Ss5MaT2 showed the highest activity with malonyl-CoA and a weak activity with acetyl-CoA (relative activity, 3% of malonyl-CoA under standard assay conditions), whereas methylmalonyl-CoA, succinyl-CoA, p-coumaroyl-CoA, caffeoyl-CoA, and benzoyl-CoA failed to serve as acyl donors. Thus, it could be concluded that Ss5MaT2 is a malonyl-CoA:anthocyanin 5-glucoside 4″-O-malonyltransferase. The Ss5MaT2 activity was completely inhibited by the following metal ions (0.1 mM): Cd²⁺, Cu²⁺, Fe²⁺, Hg²⁺, and Zn²⁺. However, the effects of other metal ions (Ca²⁺, Co²⁺, Mg²⁺, Mn²⁺, Ni²⁺, and Sn²⁺) were negligible. The activity was strongly inhibited by 0.1 mM CoA-SH (remaining activity, 0%) and partially inhibited by the following compounds: 0.1 mM acetyl-CoA (32%), 1 mM caffeic acid (38%), and 0.05 mM bisdemalonylsalvianin (31%). A kinetic analysis showed that CoA-SH and bisdemalonylsalvianin served as dead-end inhibitors, with $K_d$ values of 1.3 ± 0.4 and 8.2 ± 2.1 µM, respectively. Ss5MaT2 activity was strongly inactivated by 5 mM N-ethylmaleimide (remaining activity, 0% after incubation at 20°C for 20 min) and partially by 1 mM diethylpyrocarbonate (remaining activity, 69%) under the same conditions.

cDNA cloning, heterologous expression, and characterization

The 46-kDa protein band was extracted from SDS-PAGE gels and digested with lysylendopeptidase, as described previously by Fujiwara et al. (1999). The resulting peptides were separated by reversed-phase HPLC, and some of the purified peptides were subjected to automated Edman degradation. Two partial amino acid sequences were determined (Figure 2): NYHISFLDQHVVK (peptide 1) and EGD-GLEAWVHLNE (peptide 2). We designed two degenerated primers based on these sequences and carried out a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using these primers and poly(A) + RNA isolated from S. splendens flowers as a template to obtain a 1-kbp amplified DNA fragment. Using the fragment as a probe, the cDNA library of 300,000 clones was screened under high-stringency conditions, and 67 positive clones were obtained. The inserted cDNAs of these clones were subcloned into the pBK-CMV phagemid vector, and the nucleotide sequence of the longest insert was determined. The full-length cDNA (GenBank Accession number AY383734) encoded a protein comprised of 417 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 46,346 Da. A primary structure analysis revealed it to be a member of the BAHD family, judging from the presence of motifs 1 and 3 in its deduced amino acid sequence (Figure 2; see below for details). Thus, this cDNA was tentatively termed SsAT412. The SsAT412 protein was expressed under the T5 promoter in Escherichia coli JM109 cells as an in-frame N-terminal fusion with a 6xHis-Tag, yielding 3 mg of the recombinant protein from 60 l of culture. It was a soluble, catalytically active protein with an estimated molecular mass of 46 kDa and was purified to apparent homogeneity. The purified SsAT412 showed significant 5MaT2 activity (Figure 1) catalyzing the malonyl-CoA-dependent malonyl transfer to the 4″-position of monodemalonylsalvianin to produce salvianin (Table 2)

The location of motifs 1–3 are shown with bars. Partial amino acid sequences of peptides 1 and 2 determined by an automated Edman degradation are also shown above the Ss5MaT2 sequence.

with a maximum activity at pH 8.5, as was observed for the native Ss5MaT2. The other enzymatic properties of SsAT412, such as acyl donor specificity, acyl acceptor specificity, and inhibitor specificity, were closely related to those of the native Ss5MaT2, as described above. To further confirm that the SsAT412 cDNA indeed encoded the protein responsible for 5MaT2 activity in S. splendens flowers, we carried out immunological analyses of 5MaT2 activity in a crude extract of S. splendens flowers using rabbit anti-SsAT412 immunoglobulin G (IgG). Western blot analyses of the crude extract of S. splendens flowers using anti-SsAT412 IgG showed a single immunopositive band of a protein with a molecular mass of 46 kDa (Figure 3a, lane 1), which corresponded precisely to the value determined with Ss5MaT2 purified from S. splendens flowers. Western blot analysis using IgG also showed the absence of immunoreactive proteins in a crude extract of leaves of Perilla frutescens (Figure 3a, lane 2). P. frutescens is a labiate plant congeneric to S. splendens that exhibits 5MaT1 activity to accumulate malonylshisonin (a monomalonylated anthocyanin) as the predominant anthocyanin but shows no 5MaT2 activity and is devoid of dimalonylated anthocyanin. We also carried out immuno-

precipitation studies of 5MaT2 activity in the crude extract of S. splendens flowers using rabbit anti-SsAT412 IgG. The results showed that 5MaT2 activity in the crude extract was specifically precipitated with the antibody in a dose-dependent manner. 5MaT2 activity in the supernatant was undetectable when an excess of the anti-SsAT412 IgG was added, while full 5MaT1 activity still remained in the supernatant under the same conditions (Figure 3b). These results provide evidence to show that the cloned cDNA encoded Ss5MaT2, which is responsible for 5MaT2 activity in S. splendens flowers. Thus, the SsAT412 was duly redesignated as Ss5MaT2.

Quantitative real-time PCR

To evaluate the functional significance of Ss5MaT2 in salvinian biosynthesis in salvia flowers, organ specificity and developmental changes of Ss5MaT2 expression in the salvia plant were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR, and the results were compared with those for Ss5MaT1, which is responsible for the first malonylation during salvinian biosynthesis. The Ss5MaT2 and Ss5MaT1 transcripts were discriminatively quantified by real-time PCR using total

RNAs extracted from various organs as templates with primers specific for the respective cDNAs (Figure 4a). The Ss5MaT2 transcript was the most abundant in red flowers, with the highest level of transcription occurring at stage 2 of flower development. On the other hand, only a small amount of transcript could be found in roots, stems, and leaves (Figure 4b). The steady-state transcript levels of Ss5MaT2 in flowers were two to five times higher than those of Ss5MaT1 throughout flower development. Unexpectedly, a considerable level of Ss5MaT2 transcription was detected in white flowers. This result was further corroborated by a Western blotting analysis of the crude extract from white flowers, which yielded an immunopositive band when analyzed with anti-SsAT412 IgG (not shown). Importantly, however, this was also the case for Ss5MaT1, for which an appreciable transcript level was identified in the white salvia flower. Thus, the pattern of Ss5MaT2 expression was entirely consistent with that of Ss5MaT1.

Primary structure and phylogenetics

The deduced amino acid sequence of Ss5MaT2 (Figure 2) contained two highly conserved sequences of the BAHD family, -HXXXD- (motif 1) and -DFGWG- (motif 3). Unexpectedly, however, the signature sequence -YFGNC- (motif 2; see the Ss5MaT1 sequence) that has specifically been identified among the sequences of the AATs of the family was not identified in the Ss5MaT2 sequence. Moreover,

Ss5MaT2 showed only a low sequence similarity (identity, 22–24%) to known AAT members of the family, including Ss5MaT1 (24%), but exhibited the highest sequence similarity to acetyl-CoA:benzylalcohol acetyltransferase (BEAT, 31% identity), an enzyme that is involved in the production of volatile benzyl acetate in *Clarkia breweri* flowers.

(Dudareva *et al.*, 1998). Indeed, a molecular phylogenetic analysis suggested that Ss5MaT2 is more related to BEAT rather than to AAT (Figure 5). These observations led us to examine the issue of whether Ss5MaT2 has any BEAT-related activities, such as those of BEAT, benzoyl-CoA:benzylalcohol benzoyltransferase (BEBT; D'Auria *et al.*, 2002),

and alcohol acetyltransferase (SAAT; Aharoni *et al.*, 2000). However, the analysis revealed that neither benzylalcohol (a substrate of BEAT and BEBT) nor 1-octanol (a substrate of SAAT) served as substrates for Ss5MaT2 when any of the following acyl-CoAs was used as an acyl donor substrate: acetyl-CoA, benzoyl-CoA, malonyl-CoA, *p*-coumaroyl-CoA, and caffeoyl-CoA (data not shown).

### Discussion

Anthocyanin glucosides have many potential sites for enzymatic acylation. In fact, many anthocyanins exist as their polyacylated forms, which appear to be of biochemical significance in flower coloration (Honda and Saito, 2002; Nakayama *et al.*, 2003). Recent studies show that multiple acylations of anthocyanin generally take place in an obligatorily sequential manner during anthocyanin biosynthesis and are catalyzed by members of the BAHD family (Suzuki *et al.*, 2001, 2003). A phylogenetic analysis of previously published sequences of BAHD family members suggests that the BAHD family consists of several phylogenetic subgroups (Burhenne *et al.*, 2003; Hoffmann *et al.*, 2003; Nakayama *et al.*, 2003; St-Pierre and De Luca, 2000; St-Pierre *et al.*, 1998). The analysis also suggests that metabolically related BAHD family members have a close evolutionary relationship with each other and have diverged from a single subgroup of the family, as exemplified by known AATs as well as BAHD members that are involved in taxol biosynthesis (Figure 5), although the BAHD family also contains a subgroup consisting of members that catalyze the esterification of metabolically unrelated molecules (Burhenne *et al.*, 2003; D'Auria *et al.*, 2002; Hoffmann *et al.*, 2003). In some plant species, the multiple malonylation of anthocyanins may be achieved by the action of a malonyltransferase capable of catalyzing consecutive malonyl transfers. For example, anthocyanin dimalonylation, which is involved in the biosynthesis of the flower pigment of *Dendranthema × morifolium* (chrysanthemum), can be catalyzed by a single enzyme, anthocyanin 3-*O*-3′,6″-*O*-dimalonyltransferase (Dm3MaT2), which catalyzes the consecutive malonylation of the 3′ and 6′ positions of anthocyanidin 3-*O*-glucoside in that order (Suzuki *et al.*, 2004). This enzyme has a close phylogenetic relationship with the 6″-*O*-monomalonyltransferases of congener plants (*i.e.* Dm3MaT1, Sc3MaT1, and Dv3MaT; see Figure 5). In the light of these observations, it was presumed that Ss5MaT2 should also be a member of the AAT subgroup, as was the case for Ss5MaT1 and all other AATs.

During the course of our homology-based approach to obtain cDNA that encoded Ss5MaT2, we initially isolated a cDNA, termed SsAT201 (GenBank Accession number AY383735). This cDNA presumably encoded an AAT, whose deduced amino acid sequence contained motifs 1–3 and showed a 53% identity to the Ss5MaT1 sequence. That

SsAT201 functions as a 3-aromatic acyltransferase cDNA that is also involved in salvianin biosynthesis was highly unlikely because we had previously identified the 3-aromatic acyltransferase cDNA (Ss3AT, GenBank Accession number AY395719; unpublished results; see also Figure 5). A Northern blot analysis of the spatial expression of this cDNA in *S*. *splendens* revealed that it was specifically expressed in the pigmented organs of the plant (unpublished results), as was observed for Ss5MaT1 cDNA, implying that SsAT201 may encode Ss5MaT2. However, the recombinant SsAT201 expressed in *E*. *coli* cells showed no 5MaT2 activity, and the 5MaT2 activity in *S*. *splendens* flowers was not co-precipitated with the polyclonal anti-SsAT201 antibodies (unpublished results). Consequently, we concluded that the SsAT201 did not encode Ss5MaT2. We then adopted an alternative strategy, in which Ss5MaT2 was purified from *S*. *splendens* flowers, its partial amino acid sequences were determined, and the cDNA that encoded a protein responsible for 5MaT2 activity was isolated. As a result, we identified a cDNA coding for a new BAHD member SsAT412, whose primary structure lacked motif 2 and had only a very low similarity to those of other known AATs. We concluded that the SsAT412 cDNA encoded Ss5MaT2 on the basis of the following observations: (i) the expressed SsAT412 showed 5MaT2 activity, producing salvianin from malonyl-CoA and monodemalynlsalvianin; (ii) the enzymatic properties of the recombinant SsAT412, such as molecular mass, kinetic parameters with respect to 5MaT2 activity, acyl acceptor specificity, acyl donor specificity, and effect on 5MaT2 activity by metal ions or chemicals, were closely related to those of native Ss5MaT2 purified from *S*. *splendens* flowers; (iii) the steady-state transcript level of Ss5MaT2 was the highest in fully pigmented flowers of stage 2. Moreover, the observed patterns of the temporal and spatial expressions of Ss5MaT2 were correlated with the trends observed for Ss5MaT1. Thus, Ss5MaT2 expression should be closely related to salvianin biosynthesis in the salvia flower, although the biological significance of the expression of Ss5MaT1 and Ss5MaT2 in white salvia flowers remains to be clarified; and (iv) the 5MaT2 activity in the *S*. *splendens* flowers was co-precipitated with polyclonal anti-SsAT412 IgG.

A phylogenetic analysis suggested that Ss5MaT2 (=SsAT412) was more related to BEAT and diversified from a subgroup of the BAHD family consisting of members that catalyze the esterification of metabolically unrelated molecules compared with AAT (Figure 4). Despite its phylogenetic position, Ss5MaT2 showed no activities that may be related to those of the BEAT-related members of the family, insofar as it was examined. Plant species should contain numerous BAHD-related genes in their genomes, as evidenced by the total genome sequence of *Arabidopsis thaliana*. There might have been a variety of evolutionary events

on these BAHD-related genes, resulting in the diversification of BAHD members in the secondary metabolism. Although BAHD members with a similar biochemical function may have easily evolved from the same subgroup of the family, they may also have evolved from a different subgroup as well, resulting in the functional versatility of the BAHD family, and Ss5MaT2 might represent such an example. This could also be illustrated by the recent identification of BEBT, which is a BAHD member of *C. breweri*, an annual plant native to California. In this plant species, another BAHD member, BEAT, is mainly responsible for the production of floral volatile benzyl acetate. BEBT is also capable of catalyzing the production of benzyl benzoate, a related volatile ester. Although they are both involved in the production of metabolically related compounds, BEBT and BEAT are distantly related to each other in their phylogeny (Figure 5).

The relatively low catalytic competence of Ss5MaT2 is noteworthy. The $k_{\text{cat}}$ and $k_{\text{cat}}/K_{\text{m}}$ values for Ss5MaT2 were only less than 10% of the reported values for other AATs (Nakayama et al., 2003); for example, the values for other AATs for their presumed physiological substrates are as follows: for Ss5MaT1, $k_{\text{cat}}$, 7.8 sec⁻¹; and $k_{\text{cat}}/K_{\text{m}}$, 137 sec⁻¹ mM⁻¹ for the acyl donor and 77 sec⁻¹ mM⁻¹ for the acyl acceptor (Suzuki et al., 2001); for Dv3MaT1, $k_{\text{cat}}$, 7.3 sec⁻¹; and $k_{\text{cat}}/K_{\text{m}}$, 388 sec⁻¹ mM⁻¹ for the acyl donor and 155 sec⁻¹ mM⁻¹ for the acyl acceptor (Suzuki et al., 2002). This observation also parallels the observed kinetics of BEBT, which may act on the same substrates as BEAT with lower $k_{\text{cat}}$ and $k_{\text{cat}}/K_{\text{m}}$ values for acetyl-CoA. Taking these data into account together with the fact that Ss5MaT2 could more easily undergo product inhibitions (see the section under Results), it is likely that Ss5MaT2 would be rather 'imperfect' for an AAT with a distant phylogenetic relationship with other AATs. It is plausible that, in the *S. splendens* plant, the low catalytic activity of Ss5MaT2 may be compensated by an enhanced Ss5MaT2 expression, which is two to five times higher than that of Ss5MaT1.

### Experimental procedures

#### Plant materials, anthocyanins, and chemicals

Flowers (1.0–1.5 cm) of recently opened scarlet sage (*S. splendens*), purchased from a local market in Sendai, Japan, were collected and stored at –80°C until used. The *S. splendens* plant used for the analyses of the temporal and spatial expressions of the Ss5MaT2 and Ss5MaT1 genes were obtained from a local market in Miyazaki, Japan. Salvinian, monodemalonylsalvinian, and other anthocyanins were isolated and purified from scarlet sage flowers using an established procedure (Suzuki et al., 2001) and used as authentic samples after confirmation of their structures by instrumental analyses. 1-Octanol and benzylalcohol were purchased from Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan. Acetyl-CoA, benzoyl-CoA, malonyl-CoA, succinyl-CoA, and methylmalonyl-CoA

were the products of Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA. p-Coumaroyl-CoA and caffeoyl-CoA were obtained as described previously by Fujiwara et al. (1999).

#### Enzyme and protein assays

In the assays of 5MaT2 activity, the standard reaction mixture (100 μl) consisted of 20 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 60 μM malonyl-CoA, 120 μM monodemalonylsalvinian, and enzyme. After incubation at 30°C for 20 min, the reaction was terminated by adding 200 μl of ice-cold 0.5% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid. Anthocyanins in the resulting mixture were analyzed by reversed-phase HPLC using the Dynamax system (Rainin Instruments Co., Woburn, MA, USA) with an Asahipak ODP-50 4E column (Shoko, Tokyo, Japan). The eluted fractions were detected at 520 nm under analytical conditions described previously by Suzuki et al. (2001). BEAT, BEBT, and SAAT activities were assayed as described previously by Aharoni et al. (2000), D'Auria et al. (2002), and Dudareva et al. (1998). Protein was quantified by the method described by Bradford (1976) using a Bio-Rad Protein Assay kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) with bovine serum albumin as the standard.

#### Purification of Ss5MaT2 from *S. splendens* flowers

All operations were performed at 4°C. A potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 30 mM 2-mercaptoethanol (termed PBB) was used as the standard buffer throughout the enzyme purification. *S. splendens* flowers (1.3 kg) were homogenized in a Waring blender with 5200 ml of 100 mM PBB containing 5 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5% (w/v) polyvinylpyrrolidone, followed by centrifugation at 9000 g for 30 min. The supernatant (4400 ml) was taken to be 50% saturation with ammonium sulfate, and the resulting precipitate was collected by centrifugation at 9000 g for 30 min. The precipitate was dissolved in 300 ml of the same buffer. Polyethylenimine was added to the enzyme solution to a final concentration of 0.1% (w/v), followed by centrifugation at 9000 g for 30 min to remove nucleic acids. The supernatant was extensively dialyzed against 20 mM PBB. The enzyme solution (420 ml) was applied to a diethylaminoethyl (DEAE)-Sepharose column (100 ml, Amersham Bioscience, Piscataway, NJ, USA), which had been previously equilibrated with 20 mM PBB, using an Econo system (Bio-Rad). After extensively washing the column with 20 mM PBB, the enzyme was eluted at a flow rate of 2 ml min⁻¹ with a linear gradient (in 500 min) of 0–1 M NaCl in 20 mM PBB. Active fractions (50 ml) were combined, taken to be 20% saturation with ammonium sulfate, and immediately applied to a phenyl-Sepharose (low-sub) column (20 ml, Amersham Bioscience) equilibrated with 20 mM PBB containing ammonium sulfate at 20% saturation at a flow rate of 1 ml min⁻¹ using a fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) system (Amersharm Bioscience). The flow-through fractions that contained enzyme activity were combined and applied to a phenyl-Sepharose (high-sub) column (20 ml, Amersham Bioscience) equilibrated with the same buffer at a flow rate of 1 ml min⁻¹ using an FPLC system. After washing the column with the same buffer, the enzyme was eluted with a cross-linear gradient (in 200 min) of 0–50% (v/v) ethyleneglycol and 20–0% saturation of ammonium sulfate in 20 mM PBB. The enzyme solution (27 ml) was dialyzed against 10 mM PBB containing 0.1% (w/v) CHAPS (2-[3-cholamidopropyl]-dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate) and then subjected to FPLC on a CHT-I hydroxyapatite column (5 ml, Bio-Rad) equilibrated with the same buffer. The enzyme solution was

applied to the column at a flow rate of 0.1 ml min⁻¹. After the column was washed with 20 mM PBB containing 0.1% (w/v) CHAPS, the enzyme was eluted with a linear gradient (in 100 min) of 20–100 mM PBB containing 0.1% (w/v) CHAPS. The active fractions (11 ml) were combined, concentrated to 0.8 ml by ultrafiltration, and subjected to FPLC on a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200 pg column (Amersham Bioscience) equilibrated with 20 mM PBB containing 0.1% (w/v) CHAPS and 0.15 M NaCl. The column was developed with the equilibration buffer at a flow rate of 1 ml min⁻¹. The active fractions were combined, dialyzed against 10 mM PBB containing 0.1% (w/v) CHAPS, and applied to a Mono Q HR 16/10 column (Amersham Bioscience) equilibrated with the same buffer at a flow rate of 0.2 ml min⁻¹ using an FPLC system. After washing the column with the same buffer, the enzyme was eluted with a linear gradient (in 200 min) of 0–1 M NaCl in 10 mM PBB containing 0.1% (w/v) CHAPS.

### cDNA cloning

A pair of degenerate oligonucleotide primers, 5′-TT(T/C)CTI-GA(T/C)CA(A/G)CA(T/C)GTIGTIAA-3′ and 5′-TGIACCCACIGC(T/C)TC(A/G/T)ATICC-3′ (I, inosine), were designed on the basis of the partial amino acid sequences of the purified enzyme determined as described previously (see Results). Total RNA was isolated from S. splendens flowers using the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and used for the isolation of poly(A)+ RNA using Oligotex™-dT30 Super Kit (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). With the primers and the poly(A)+ RNA as a template, an RT-PCR was performed using a QiAGEN OneStep RT-PCR Kit (Qiagen). Thermal cycling conditions were as follows: The RT-PCR mixture was incubated at 50°C for 30 min for reverse transcription and then at 95°C for 15 min for the activation of DNA polymerase and the inactivation of reverse transcriptase, followed by 35 cycles of PCR (one cycle consists of 94°C for 30 sec, 50°C for 30 sec, and 72°C for 1 min), and finally incubated at 72°C for 10 min. The amplified fragment (1 kbp) was DIG (digoxigenin)-labeled using the PCR DIG Probe Synthesis Kit (Roche Diagnostics). With the DIG-labeled amplified fragment as a probe, the cDNA library of S. splendens flowers, approximately 300 000 plaques, was screened as described previously by Suzuki *et al.* (2001). The cDNA of positive clones was subcloned into the pBK-CMV phagemid vector following the manufacturer’s instructions and subjected to DNA sequencing using a Dye-Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA, USA) with a CEQ 2000 DNA analysis system (Beckman Coulter).

### Preparation of anti-SsAT412 antibodies

Japanese white (female) rabbits were immunized with the non-denatured form of SsAT412 (see Results) by intradermal injection of the immunogen at multiple sites according to standard protocols (Vaitukaitis, 1981). The initial injection was administered in complete Freund’s Adjuvant with all subsequent immunization (boosts) in incomplete Freund’s Adjuvant. The collected serum was subjected to ammonium sulfate fractionation, and the precipitate from a 0–50% saturation fraction was dissolved in 5 ml of a 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. The protein solution was applied to a Protein A-Sepharose column (3 ml, Amersham Bioscience) that had been equilibrated with the same buffer. After washing the column with the same buffer, IgG was eluted with a 0.1 M sodium citrate buffer, pH 4.0. The eluate containing IgG was immediately dialyzed against a 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0.

### SDS-PAGE and Western blotting

Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was carried out as described by Laemmli (1970). The proteins on the gels were visualized by silver staining and/or staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. For Western blotting analyses, proteins in the SDS-PAGE gel were transferred to an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA), which was then blocked with the recommended dilution of a blocking reagent (Amersham Bioscience) at room temperature for 2 h. The blots were probed with a 1 : 1000 dilution of the primary anti-SsAT412 IgG (rabbit) and 1 : 5000 dilution of the secondary donkey antirabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate. The immune complexes were visualized by means of a peroxidase-catalyzed chemiluminescence reaction using an ECL Western blotting kit (Amersham Bioscience) following the manufacturer’s recommendations.

### Immunoprecipitation

Varying amounts of the purified anti-SsAT412 IgG (0–340 μg) and bovine serum albumin (340–0 μg) were added to the crude extract of S. splendens flowers; the total amount of the added proteins was fixed at 340 μg. The mixtures (final volume, 100 μl) were incubated at 4°C for 16 h, followed by centrifugation for 20 min at 18 000 g, and the resulting supernatants were assayed for 5MaT2 and 5MaT1 activities. The results are presented as the average of four independent experiments with ±SEs.

### Heterologous expression

The full-length open-reading frame of the SsAT412 cDNA was amplified by PCR using the primers 5′-GGATCCATGAATATCAACCAAATC-3′ and 5′-GGTACCTTAGCACAAAATAACTTG-3′, to introduce two restriction sites, 5′-BamHI and 3′-KpnI, which is immediately followed by start codon and preceded by a stop codon, respectively. The amplified fragment was cloned into a pCR4Blunt-TOPO vector and sequenced to confirm the absence of PCR errors. The fragment was digested with BamHI and KpnI and then ligated with a pQE-30 vector (Qiagen) that had previously been digested with BamHI and KpnI. The resultant plasmid was used to transform *E. coli* JM109 cells. The recombinant SsAT412 was expressed in the transformant cells and purified to apparent homogeneity, essentially as described previously by Suzuki *et al.* (2001).

### Quantitative real-time PCR

Total RNA was prepared from the individual organs of an S. splendens plant using the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen). The Ss5MaT2 and Ss5MaT1 transcripts in 200 ng of total RNA were quantified by quantitative real-time PCR with the Ss5MaT2-specific primers (5′-TGGACGAAGGTGTTGATG-3′ and 5′-CACGTCGAAAAACCCTATG-3′) and the Ss5MaT1-specific primers (5′-GAAGGGAGAGAATCAC-3′ and 5′-CATCGGTTTCTCCAATCAC-3′), respectively. Real-time PCR was carried out using the LightCycler Quick System model 330 (Roche Diagnostics) and the QuantiTect SYBR Green RT-PCR Kit (Qiagen). Thermal cycling conditions were 50°C for 20 min and then 95°C for 15 min, followed by 32 cycles of 95°C for 15 sec, 55°C for 20 sec, and 72°C for 10 sec. The results are presented as the average of four independent determinations with ±SEs.
