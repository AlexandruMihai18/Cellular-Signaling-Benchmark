Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP₃) and cAMP are the two second messengers that play an important role in neuronal signaling. Here, we investigated the interactions of InsP₃- and cAMP-mediated signaling pathways activated by dopamine in striatal medium spiny neurons (MSN). We found that in ~40% of the MSN, application of dopamine elicited robust repetitive Ca²⁺ transients (oscillations). In pharmacological experiments with specific agonists and antagonists, we found that the observed Ca²⁺ oscillations were triggered by activation of D1 class dopamine receptors (DARs). We further demonstrated that activation of phospholipase C was required for induction of dopamine-induced Ca²⁺ oscillations and that maintenance of dopamine-evoked Ca²⁺ oscillations required both Ca²⁺ influx and Ca²⁺ mobilization from internal Ca²⁺ stores. In “priming” experiments with a type 2 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor agonist, we have shown a likely role for calcyon in coupling D1 class DARs with Ca²⁺ oscillations in MSN. In experiments with the DAR-specific agonist SKF83959, we discovered that phospholipase C activation alone could not account for dopamine-induced Ca²⁺ oscillations. We further demonstrated that direct activation of protein kinase A by 8-bromo-cAMP or inhibition of protein phosphatase-1 (PP1) or calcineurin (PP2B) resulted in elevation of basal Ca²⁺ levels in MSN, but not in Ca²⁺ oscillations. In experiments with competitive peptides, we have shown an importance of type 1 InsP₃ receptor association with PP1α and with AKAP9-protein kinase A for dopamine-induced Ca²⁺ oscillations. In experiments with MSN from DARPP-32 knock-out mice, we demonstrated a regulatory role of DARPP-32 in dopamine-induced Ca²⁺ oscillations. Our results indicate that, following D1 class DAR activation, InsP₃ and cAMP signaling pathways converge on the type 1 InsP₃ receptor, resulting in Ca²⁺ oscillations in MSN.

subtypes of dopamine receptors (DARs) (3–5). On the basis of their molecular structure and pharmacological properties, DARs are divided into the D1 class (D1R and D5R) and D2 class (D2R, D3R, and D4R) (6). D1 class DARs are coupled to Gₛ/olf, activation of adenylyl cyclase, and cAMP production (3). Activation of D2 class DARs has dual effects of inhibiting cAMP production (3) and activating phospholipase Cβ (PLCβ) (7). A putative D1 class DAR subtype coupled to PLC activation and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-diphosphate hydrolysis, but not to cAMP production, has been postulated (8–10), but has not yet been isolated or cloned. Recently, a specific agonist for this receptor (SKF83959) was identified (11). The D1R-binding protein calcyon has been isolated by yeast two-hybrid methods (12). Association of D1/D5 receptors with calcyon enables coupling of D1/D5 receptors with Gq/11, resulting in PLC activation and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP₃) generation (12, 13).

Cross-talk between cAMP and Ca²⁺ signaling pathways plays an important role in dopaminergic signaling in the neostriatum (1). Activation of D1 class DARs enhances L-type Ca²⁺ channel activity (14–16) and currents via the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor (17) and the N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor (18, 19). In contrast, activation of D2 class DARs reduces L-type Ca²⁺ currents (7) and NMDA receptor activity (20). D1/D5 receptor-mediated facilitation of L-type Ca²⁺ channels and AMPA and NMDA receptors results from increased phosphorylation of these channels by protein kinase A (PKA) (16, 21) and decreased dephosphorylation of these channels by protein phosphatase-1 (PP1) (17, 22, 23). DARPP-32 (dopamine- and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein of Mr 32,000) (24, 25) is partly responsible for inhibition of PP1 activity following activation of D1/D5 receptors (26). DARPP-32 phosphorylated by PKA at a single threonine residue (Thr-34) is transformed into a potent inhibitor of PP1, which in turn regulates the phosphorylation state of many neurotransmitter receptors and voltage-gated ion channels (1).

The type 1 inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (InsP₃R1) is a predominant InsP₃ receptor isoform in the brain (27). InsP₃R1 plays an important role in neuronal Ca²⁺ signaling (28). Neuronal InsP₃R1 is one of the major substrates of PKA phosphorylation in the brain (29, 30). PKA phosphorylates InsP₃R1 at two sites, Ser-1589 and Ser-1755 (31–36). PKA phosphorylation activates InsP₃R1 by increasing the sensitivity of InsP₃R1 to activation by InsP₃ (35, 37–39). In previous biochemical studies, we discovered direct association of neuro-

In experiments with striatal slices, we demonstrated transient phosphorylation of striatal InsP₃R1 by PKA in response to dopamine and proposed that InsP₃R1 may participate in cross-talk between cAMP and Ca²⁺ dopaminergic signaling pathways in the striatum (39). In this study, we used Ca²⁺ imaging techniques to investigate dopamine-induced Ca²⁺ signals in primary cultures of striatal MSN.

**EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES**

**DARPP-32 Knock-out Mice—** The generation and breeding of DARPP-32 knock-out mice (C57BL/6; a kind gift of Dr. Paul Greengard) were described previously (26, 41). The brains of day 14.5–15.5 embryos from wild-type (D32⁺/⁺) and DARPP-32 knock-out (D32⁻/⁻) mice were collected, and the striata were dissected. The striatal lysates of wild-type and D32⁻/⁻ embryos were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-DARPP-32 monoclonal antibodies (Cell Signaling Technologies).

**Primary Cultures of Rat and Mouse MSN—** Primary cultures of rat MSN were established from day 17–18 rat embryos as described previously (42). The mouse MSN cultures were established with some modifications of the protocol used for rat MSN culture. Briefly, using landmarks described previously (43), striata were dissected from brains of D32⁺/⁺ and D32⁻/⁻ embryonic mice in ice-cold dissection solution (1× divalent-free Hank's balanced salt solution, 15 mM HEPES, 10 mM NaHCO₃, and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen), pH 7.2). The striata from mice with identical genotypes were pooled and treated with 0.25% trypsin for 7 min at 37 °C. After addition of 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen), the tissue was dissociated with trituration solution (1× divalent-free Hank's balanced salt solution and 1.0% DNase I, pH 7.2) (44) by repetitive pipetting. The cells were washed; plated at a density of 1 × 10⁶ cells/ml on 12-mm round coverslips precoated with poly-d-lysine (*M* = 30,000–70,000, 0.01% final concentration) in plating medium containing 60% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 30% Neurobasal medium, 10% fetal bovine serum, and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin; and maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO₂. 24 h later, the cultures were transferred to culture medium (65% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 30% Neurobasal medium, 1× B27 (Invitrogen), 5% fetal bovine serum, and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin). 4 μM cytosine arabinoside (Sigma) was added at 2–4 days *in vitro* (DIV) to inhibit glial cell growth. The cultures were fed with fresh culture medium every 7 days. The identity of established cultures was confirmed in immunostaining experiments with anti-GAD65 monoclonal antibodies (Chemicon International, Inc.).

**Ca²⁺ Imaging Experiments—** Ca²⁺ imaging experiments with 18–20 DIV rat and 16–18 DIV mouse MSN were performed as described previously (42). Briefly, MSN were loaded with 5 μM Fura-2/AM (Molecular Probes, Inc.) in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF; 140 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl₂, 2 mM CaCl₂, and 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.3) for 45 min at 37 °C. For imaging experiments, the coverslips were mounted on a recording/perfusion chamber (RC-26G, Warner Instruments) maintained at 37 °C (PH1, Warner Instruments), positioned on the movable stage of an Olympus IX-70 inverted microscope, and perfused with ACSF by gravity flow. For some experiments (see below), the culture was washed extensively with Ca²⁺-free ACSF (CaCl₂ was omitted from ACSF, which was supplemented with 100 μM EGTA). Following Fura-2 loading, the MSN cells were intermittently excited by 340- and 380-nm UV light (DeltaRAM illuminator, PTI) using a Fura-2 dichroic filter cube (Chroma Technologies) and a 60× UV light-grade oil immersion objective (Olympus). The emitted light was collected by an IC-300 camera (PTI), and the images were digitized by ImageMaster Pro software (PTI). Base-line (1–3 min) measurements were obtained prior to bath application of dopamine dissolved in ACSF or Ca²⁺-free ACSF. Others drugs were applied to the recording chamber as described below. The dopamine and drug solutions were prewarmed to 37 °C before application to MSN. Images at 340- and 380-nm excitation wavelengths were captured every 5 s, and 340/380 nm ratio image traces were recorded. Background fluorescence was determined according to the manufacturer’s (PTI) recommendations and subtracted.

**R9 Peptide Loading Experiments—** R9 (RRRRRRRRRR) and R9-IC (RRRRRRRRRGHPPHMNVNPQQPA) peptides were chemically synthesized (University of Texas Southwestern Protein Chemistry Technology Center), coupled to fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) at the N terminus, and dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline. In loading experiments, the R9 peptides were added to rat MSN for 10 min at 50 μM.

Following R9 peptide loading, neurons were washed and incubated in culture medium for ~2 h prior to Ca²⁺ imaging experiments. As judged by FITC fluorescence, >90% of the MSN were loaded with the R9 and R9-IC peptides in these experiments.

**Enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein (EGFP) and EGFP-RT1-Leucine/Isoleucine Zipper (LIZ) Transfections—** The EGFP-RT1-LIZ construct was generated by subcloning the PCR-amplified LIZ region of rat InsP₃R1 (amino acids 1251–1287) (40) into the pEGFP-C3 expression vector (Clontech) and verified by sequencing. The pEGFP-C3 expression vector without an insert was used as a negative control (EGFP). The rat MSN cultures at 19–20 DIV were transfected with the EGFP or EGFP-RT1-LIZ plasmid by the calcium phosphate method as described previously (42, 45). 48 h after transfection, MSN were loaded with 5 μM Fura-2/AM and used in Ca²⁺ imaging experiments as described above. Prior to Ca²⁺ imaging experiments, EGFP- and EGFP-RT1-LIZ-transfected MSN were identified by GFP imaging as described previously (42).

**Drugs—** SKF83959 was provided by the National Institute of Mental Health Synthesis Program (Menlo Park, CA). Dopamine hydrobromide, atropine sulfate, U73122, U73343, thapsigargin, 8-bromo (Br)-cAMP, calyculin A, cyclosporin A, and okadaic acid were from Calbiochem. (+)-SKF38393 hydrobromide ((±)-1-phenyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-(1H)-3-benzazepine-7,8-diol hydrochloride), *R*(+)-SCH23390 hydrochloride, spiperone hydrochloride, (+)-MK801 maleate, (−)-quinpirole dihydrochloride, tetrodotoxin (TTX), ketanserin tartrate, prazosin hydrochloride, α-methyl-5-hydroxytryptamine, 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX), and nifedipine were purchased from Tocris (Ellisville, MO).

**RESULTS**

**Dopamine Induces Ca²⁺ Oscillations in MSN—** To test the effects of dopamine stimulation on Ca²⁺ signaling, we performed Ca²⁺ imaging experiments with primary cultures of MSN established from embryonic day 18 rats as described previously (42, 46). To monitor intracellular Ca²⁺ dynamics, MSN were loaded with the ratiometric Ca²⁺ imaging dye Fura-2, and the intracellular free Ca²⁺ concentrations were estimated from the ratio of Fura-2 emission at 340- and 380-nm excitation wavelengths (340/380 nm ratio). On average, the basal levels of 340/380 nm ratios in unstimulated MSN were equal to 0.52 ± 0.05 (*n* = 29). Approximately 40% of the cultured MSN (20 DIV) in our experiments displayed repetitive Ca²⁺ transients (oscillations) in response to application of 400 μM dopamine (Fig. 1, *A* and *B*). On average (*n* = 29 MSN), these Ca²⁺ oscillations started 5.1 ± 2.2 min after dopamine application, had an amplitude of 0.89 ± 0.1, occurred with a frequency of 12 ± 6 spikes/20 min, and lasted at least 20–30 min.

**D1 Class Receptors Specifically Mediate Dopamine-evoked Ca²⁺ Oscillations in MSN—** Striatal MSN abundantly express multiple subtypes of DARs (3–5, 47). Based on pharmacological and molecular properties, DARs are divided into two classes: D1 and D2. Which DAR class mediates the dopamine-induced Ca²⁺ oscillations observed in our experiments (Fig. 1)? To answer this question, we performed a series of experiments with D1 and D2 class receptor-specific antagonists and agonists. We found that the dopamine-induced Ca²⁺ oscillations (Figs. 1 and 2*A*) in MSN were completely blocked in the presence of 5 μM SCH23390 (D1 class DAR antagonist) and 5 μM spiperone (D2 class DAR antagonist) (Fig. 2*B*). We further found that blockade of D2 class DARs by 5 μM spiperone had only a minor effect on dopamine-induced Ca²⁺ oscillations (Fig. 2*C*), whereas blockade of D1 class DARs by 5 μM SCH23390 resulted in almost complete suppression of dopamine-induced Ca²⁺ oscillations (Fig. 2*D*). In complementary experiments, we found that the D1 class DAR-specific agonist SKF38393 (50 μM) induced Ca²⁺ oscillations in MSN (Fig. 2*E*), whereas the D2 class DAR-specific agonist quinpirole (10 μM) was much less effective (Fig. 2*F*). Characteristically, application of quinpirole resulted in an instant Ca²⁺ spike (Fig. 2*F*), whereas application of SKF38393 resulted in Ca²⁺ oscillations with a delay of several minutes (Fig. 2*E*), as observed after application of dopamine (Figs. 1*B* and 2*A*). Taken together, these data suggest

**Dopamine and Ca²⁺ Signaling in MSN**

FIG. 1. Dopamine-induced Ca²⁺ transients in rat MSN. A, dopamine induces Ca²⁺ transients in MSN. Representative images show Fura-2 340/380 nm ratios in rat MSN before (−1 min) and after (0–28 min) application of 400 μM dopamine. The images were collected in ACSF containing 2 μM TTX. Dopamine was applied to the bath at 0 min. Fura-2 340/380 nm ratio images in MSN are shown in pseudocolor for each minute of the experiment. The pseudocolor calibration scale for 340/380 nm ratios is shown on the right. B, a single 340/380 nm ratio trace in MSN. A region of interest was chosen in the soma of a single MSN (indicated by the arrowheads in A), and the 340/380 nm ratio in the selected region of interest was plotted versus time in the experiment. The basal 340/380 nm ratio (before application of dopamine) for the cell shown was 0.55. The time of 400 μM dopamine application (300 s) is indicated by the arrow. For the cell shown, Ca²⁺ oscillations started 360 s after dopamine application (at 660 s) and had an average amplitude of 0.9 and a frequency of 14 spikes/20 min. Data from the same experiment were used to generate A and B.

that activation of either D1 or D2 class DARs leads to Ca²⁺ responses in MSN, but that D1 class DARs are coupled to Ca²⁺ oscillations more efficiently and via a different mechanism than D2 class DARs.

Classical D1 class DARs (D1R and D5R) are coupled to cAMP production and not to PLC activation and InsP₃-induced Ca²⁺ release. What is an explanation for the Ca²⁺ signals observed in our experiments (Figs. 1 and 2)? One possibility is that 400 μM dopamine may facilitate action potential firing in MSN cultures, which will lead to Ca²⁺ influx via voltage-gated L-type Ca²⁺ channels. To test this possibility, we performed experiments in the presence of 2 μM TTX, a specific voltage-gated Na⁺ channel blocker that inhibits action potential firing in striatal neurons (48, 49). Preincubation of MSN with 2 μM TTX had no effect on dopamine-induced Ca²⁺ oscillations (Fig. 3A), indicating that the observed responses were not due to action potential firing in MSN cultures. Another possibility is that 400 μM dopamine can nonspecifically activate other PLC-linked neurotransmitter receptors expressed in MSN, such as 5-hydroxytryptamine type 2 (5-HT₂) receptors, α₁-adrenoceptors, and muscarinic type acetylcholine receptors (50–52). To determine whether activation of any of these receptors is involved in dopamine-induced Ca²⁺ oscillations, we repeated experiments in the presence of 20 μM ketanserin (5-HT₂ receptor antagonist), 10 μM prazosin (α₁-adrenoceptor antagonist), and 5 μM atropine (muscarinic type acetylcholine receptor antagonist). To rule out activation of D2 receptors (also coupled to PLC), we also included 5 μM spiperone (D2 class DAR antagonist). Preincubation of MSN with a TTX/spiperone/ketanserin/prazosin/atropine mixture had no significant effect on dopamine-induced Ca²⁺ oscillations (Fig. 3B), confirming that dopamine-induced Ca²⁺ oscillations are mediated primarily by D1 class DARs, with a minor contribution from D2 class DARs (Fig. 2F).

In additional control experiments, we studied Ca²⁺ signals in MSN induced by 5-HT₂ receptor activation. We found that application of 100 μM α-methyl-5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT₂ receptor-specific agonist) in the presence of 2 μM TTX induced one large Ca²⁺ spike, which was occasionally followed by one to two spikes of much smaller amplitude (Fig. 3C). These responses were completely eliminated in the presence of 20 μM ketanserin (5-HT₂ receptor antagonist) (Fig. 3D). Thus, MSN Ca²⁺ signals mediated by 5-HT₂ receptors differ from dopamine-induced responses because 1) Ca²⁺ transients in response to dopamine occurred with a lag time of 3–7 min, and the first Ca²⁺ transient in response to α-methyl-5-hydroxytryptamine occurred instantly (Fig. 3C); 2) multiple Ca²⁺ transients of equal amplitude (oscillations) were observed in response to dopamine, but only one large transient and one to two much smaller transients were observed in response to α-methyl-5-hydroxytryptamine (Fig. 3C); and 3) dopamine-induced Ca²⁺ transients were not sensitive to ketanserin (Fig. 3B), but α-methyl-5-hydroxytryptamine-induced Ca²⁺ transients were completely blocked by ketanserin (Fig. 3D). These results indicate that the dopamine-induced Ca²⁺ oscillations in our experiments were mediated predominantly by D1 class DARs, but not by 5-HT₂ receptors.

Ca²⁺ Influx Is Required for Maintenance of Dopamine-induced Ca²⁺ Oscillations in MSN—The dopamine-induced increase in the intracellular free Ca²⁺ concentration observed in our experiments (Figs. 1–3) could result from Ca²⁺ release from internal Ca²⁺ stores and/or extracellular Ca²⁺ influx. To test the role of extracellular Ca²⁺ influx in dopamine-evoked Ca²⁺ oscillations, we shifted the MSN from 2 mM Ca²⁺ in the

A, dopamine-induced Ca²⁺ transients in a single MSN. The data are representative of $n = 48$ MSN. B, a combination of a D1 class DAR antagonist (5 μM SCH23390) and a D2 class DAR antagonist (5 μM spiperone) prevents dopamine-induced Ca²⁺ oscillations in MSN ($n = 46$).

E, the D1 class DAR-specific agonist SKF38393 (50 μM) induces Ca²⁺ oscillations in MSN ($n = 10$). F, the D2 class DAR-specific agonist quinpirole (10 μM) is less potent in inducing Ca²⁺ oscillations in MSN ($n = 23$).

extracellular medium to Ca²⁺-free extracellular medium during dopamine-induced oscillations. We found that the dopamine-induced Ca²⁺ oscillations quickly ceased in Ca²⁺-free medium, but restarted again following return to the extracellular medium containing 2 mM Ca²⁺ (Fig. 4A). These experiments demonstrate that extracellular Ca²⁺ influx is required for the maintenance of dopamine-induced Ca²⁺ oscillations in MSN.

What was the source of extracellular Ca²⁺ influx in these experiments? Activation of D1 class DARs enhances L-type Ca²⁺ currents (14–16) and activates AMPA receptors (17) and NMDA receptors (16, 18, 19, 53). To evaluate a possible role of these channels in dopamine-induced Ca²⁺ oscillations, we used a combination of specific blockers of L-type Ca²⁺ channels (10 μM nifedipine), AMPA receptors (20 μM CNQX), and NMDA receptors (10 μM (+)-MK801). We found that dopamine-induced Ca²⁺ oscillations quickly ceased after application of a (+)-MK801/CNQX/nifedipine mixture (Fig. 4B). When MSN were preincubated with a (+)-MK801/CNQX/nifedipine mixture for 10 min, application of dopamine resulted in greatly attenuated Ca²⁺ oscillations (Fig. 4C). Preincubation with a (+)-MK801/CNQX, CNQX/nifedipine, or (+)-MK801/nifedipine mixture had a partial inhibitory effect on dopamine-induced Ca²⁺ oscillations (Fig. 4, D–F). From these experiments, we concluded that L-type Ca²⁺ channels and AMPA and NMDA receptors contribute jointly to maintenance of dopamine-induced Ca²⁺ oscillations in MSN, but are not required for initiation of these oscillations (Fig. 4C).

PLC Activation and Intracellular Ca²⁺ Mobilization Are Re-
quired for the Initiation and Maintenance of Dopamine-induced Ca²⁺ Oscillations in MSN—The experiments described above (Fig. 4) indicate that Ca²⁺ influx via L-type Ca²⁺ channels and AMPA and NMDA receptors is necessary for maintenance of dopamine-induced Ca²⁺ oscillations, but is not required for their initiation. Thus, in the next series of experiments, we focused on mobilization of Ca²⁺ from intracellular Ca²⁺ stores. Activation of PLC leads to hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-diphosphate and generation of diacylglycerol and InsP₃. InsP₃ activates InsP₃R1 and releases Ca²⁺ from intracellular Ca²⁺ stores. In MSN, activation of PLC-coupled class I metabotropic glutamate receptors efficiently evokes intracellular Ca²⁺ mobilization (42, 54). To test whether activation of PLC is involved in dopamine-induced Ca²⁺ oscillations in MSN, we performed experiments with U73122, a selective PLC inhibitor. We found that preincubation with 10 μM U73122 for 10 min resulted in a complete block of dopamine-induced Ca²⁺ oscillations (Fig. 5A). In contrast, preincubation with the same concentration of the inactive analog U73343 had no effect on dopamine-induced Ca²⁺ oscillations (Fig. 5B). These experiments demonstrate an essential role of PLC in initiation of dopamine-induced Ca²⁺ oscillations in MSN. To test the importance of Ca²⁺ mobilization from intracellular Ca²⁺ stores, we performed experiments with the SERCA Ca²⁺ pump-specific inhibitor thapsigargin. We found that acute application of 10 μM thapsigargin quickly stopped dopamine-induced Ca²⁺ oscillations (Fig. 5C). Preincubation of MSN with 10 μM thapsigargin for 10 min resulted in almost a complete block of

dopamine-induced Ca²⁺ oscillations (Fig. 5D). The experiments described here (Fig. 5) led us to conclude that PLC activation and InsP₃R1-mediated Ca²⁺ mobilization from intracellular Ca²⁺ stores play a critical role in initiation and maintenance of dopamine-induced Ca²⁺ oscillations.

**A Role of the Putative PLC-linked D1 Class DAR in Dopamine-induced Ca²⁺ Oscillations—** Classical D1 class DARs (D1R and D5R) are coupled to cAMP production and not to PLC activation. What is an explanation for the critical role of PLC (Fig. 5) in D1 class receptor-mediated Ca²⁺ oscillations? In control experiments, we ruled out involvement of other PLC-coupled receptors expressed in MSN, such as 5-HT₂ receptors, α₁-adrenoreceptors, and muscarinic type acetylcholine receptor receptors (Fig. 3). Recent data suggested the existence of a distinct D1 class DAR subtype that is coupled to PLC activation (8–10). This receptor has not been purified or cloned, but recently, the benzazepine compound SKF83959 has been identified as a specific agonist for this putative PLC-linked D1 class DAR subtype (11). To test a potential role of this putative D1 class receptor subtype in the observed Ca²⁺ signals, we performed experiments with SKF83959. We found that application of 400 μM SKF83959 induced an instant single Ca²⁺ transient in MSN (Fig. 6A). A similar response to 400 μM SKF83959 was observed in Ca²⁺-free medium (Fig. 6B). The response to 400 μM SKF83959 was eliminated in the presence of the PLC inhibitor U73122 (Fig. 6C). These results confirm the existence of a PLC-coupled DAR activated by SKF83959 in MSN. However, application of SKF83959 never resulted in Ca²⁺ oscillations, indicating that activation of these receptors is not sufficient to support dopamine-induced Ca²⁺ oscillations in MSN.

**A Role of Calcyon in Dopamine-induced Ca²⁺ Oscillations—** D1R and D5R are coupled to the heterotrimeric G protein α subunit Gₛ/olf, and this activation results in activation of adenyl cyclase and cAMP production. Recently, the D1R-binding protein calcyon has been identified by yeast two-hybrid

FIG. 4. Ca²⁺ influx is required for maintenance (but not initiation) of dopamine-induced Ca²⁺ oscillations in MSN. The images were collected in ACSF and analyzed as described in the Fig. 1 legend. A, dopamine-induced Ca²⁺ oscillations quickly ceased in Ca²⁺-free medium and restarted after re-addition of 2 mM Ca²⁺ to the extracellular medium (n = 43). Changes in extracellular Ca²⁺ concentration are shown above the 340/380 nm ratio trace. B, addition of a mixture of an L-type Ca²⁺ channel blocker (10 μM nifedipine), an AMPA receptor blocker (20 μM CNQX), and an NMDA receptor blocker (10 μM (+)-MK801) stopped dopamine-induced Ca²⁺ oscillations in MSN (n = 44). C, preincubation of MSN with a mixture of an L-type Ca²⁺ channel blocker (10 μM nifedipine), an AMPA receptor blocker (20 μM CNQX), and an NMDA receptor blocker (10 μM (+)-MK801) greatly attenuated dopamine-induced Ca²⁺ oscillations in MSN (n = 36). D–F, preincubation of MSN with a mixture of an AMPA receptor blocker (20 μM CNQX) and an NMDA receptor blocker (10 μM (+)-MK801) (n = 40), an L-type Ca²⁺ channel blocker (10 μM nifedipine) and an AMPA receptor blocker (20 μM CNQX) (n = 28), and an L-type Ca²⁺ channel blocker (10 μM nifedipine) and an NMDA receptor blocker (10 μM (+)-MK801) (n = 20), respectively, had a partial inhibitory effect on dopamine-induced Ca²⁺ oscillations in MSN.

itors on Ca²⁺ signals in MSN. We found that application of 500 μM 8-Br-cAMP to MSN resulted in elevation of basal Ca²⁺ levels in MSN (Fig. 8A), most likely due to PKA-induced phosphorylation and activation of InsP₃R1 (39). Similar effects were observed in response to application of 10 nM calyculin A (PP1/ PP2A inhibitor) (Fig. 8B) or 10 nM cyclosporin A (PP2B inhibitor) (Fig. 8C). In contrast, application of 1 nM okadaic acid, a PP2A-specific inhibitor at this concentration, had a less pronounced and more delayed effect on basal Ca²⁺ levels in MSN (Fig. 8D). The relative potencies of 8-Br-cAMP, calyculin A, cyclosporin A, and okadaic acid in these experiments correlate well with the relative potency of these drugs to shift striatal InsP₃R1 into the PKA-phosphorylated state that was compared in our previous experiments (39).

Persistent activation of PKA or blockade of PP1 or PP2B results in Ca²⁺ elevation, most likely due to hyperphosphorylation and activation of InsP₃R1 (39). Is it possible to generate Ca²⁺ oscillations in MSN by activating both the PLC and PKA pathways? The answer this question, we applied a mixture of 400 μM SKF83959 and 500 μM 8-Br-cAMP to MSN. We found that application of an SKF83959/8-Br-cAMP mixture (Fig. 8E) resulted in an initial small Ca²⁺ transient (similar to SKF83959 application) (Fig. 6A), followed by a persistent elevation of Ca²⁺ levels (similar to 8-Br-cAMP application) (Fig. 8A). Thus, SKF83959 and 8-Br-cAMP appear to affect Ca²⁺ levels in an independent manner, and not lead to Ca²⁺ oscillations as observed in response to dopamine. We further explored the connection between InsP₃ and cAMP signaling pathways by examining the effects of calyculin A, cyclosporin A, and okadaic acid on dopamine-induced Ca²⁺ oscillations. We found that preincubation with calyculin A suppressed dopamine-induced Ca²⁺ oscillations, presumably due to the rise in basal Ca²⁺ levels (Fig. 8F). Preincubation with cyclosporin A initially increased the frequency of Ca²⁺ oscillations and eventually suppressed oscillations, presumably due to the rise in basal Ca²⁺ levels (Fig. 8G). In contrast to calyculin A and cyclosporin A, okadaic acid did not have a significant effect on dopamine-induced Ca²⁺ oscillations (Fig. 8H). From these results, we conclude that continuous hyperphosphorylation of InsP₃R1 by PKA disrupts the *in vivo* regulatory mechanism required for dopamine-induced Ca²⁺ oscillations in MSN.

**A Role of InsP₃R1-PP1α Association in Dopamine-induced Ca²⁺ Oscillations—** In a previous study, we described a direct association between the InsP₃R1 C terminus and PP1α (39). Is formation of an InsP₃R1·PP1α complex physiologically relevant? To address this question, we introduced the IC peptide (amino acids 2736–2749 of InsP₃R1), which corresponds to a minimal PP1α-binding site in the InsP₃R1 sequence (39), into MSN. We reasoned that the IC peptide would displace PP1α from the complex with InsP₃R1 and therefore may have a dominant-negative effect on the ability of PP1α to dephosphorylate InsP₃R1. To introduce the IC peptide into MSN, we took advantage of a recently developed protein delivery technology (56, 57). In our experiments, we used the R9 signal (58) to deliver the FITC-labeled C-terminal R9-IC peptide and control R9 peptide into cultured MSN (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). 2 h following FITC-labeled R9 peptide loading, MSN were washed, loaded with Fura-2, and used in Ca²⁺ imaging experiments. Using FITC fluorescence, we estimated that >90% of the MSN were loaded with the R9 and R9-IC peptides in our experiments.

Application of 400 μM dopamine induced Ca²⁺ oscillations in both R9 (Fig. 9A) and R9-IC (Fig. 9B) peptide-loaded MSN. However, Ca²⁺ oscillations were more frequent and had increased amplitude in R9-IC peptide-loaded neurons (Fig. 9B). Statistical analysis revealed that the average basal Ca²⁺ levels were similar ($p < 0.05$) in control, R9 peptide-loaded, and R9-IC peptide-loaded MSN (Table I). The average latency from dopamine application to the first Ca²⁺ spike was shorter in R9-IC peptide-loaded neurons than in control or R9 peptide-loaded neurons (Table I), but the difference did not reach statistical significance ($p > 0.05$, unpaired t test). The average amplitude of Ca²⁺ transients was equal to 0.89 ± 0.1 ($n = 29$) in control MSN, 0.86 ± 0.09 ($n = 18$) in R9 peptide-loaded MSN, and 1.1 ± 0.15 ($n = 29$) in R9-IC peptide-loaded MSN (Table I). The average frequency of Ca²⁺ transients was equal to 12 ± 6 spikes/20 min ($n = 29$) in control MSN, 11 ± 6 spikes/20 min ($n = 18$) in R9 peptide-loaded MSN, and 20 ± 8 spikes/20 min ($n = 29$) in R9-IC peptide-loaded MSN (Table I). From these results, we determined that loading of MSN with the R9-IC peptide results in statistically significant ($p < 0.05$)

**FIG. 6. Role of the putative PLC-linked D1 class DAR in dopamine-induced Ca²⁺ oscillations.** The images were collected in ACSF and analyzed as described in the Fig. 1 legend. A, application of 400 μM SKF83959 (specific agonist for the putative PLC-linked D1 class DAR subtype) (11) induced an instant Ca²⁺ transient in MSN (*n* = 91). B, application of 400 μM SKF83959 induced a Ca²⁺ transient in MSN in Ca²⁺-free ACSF (*n* = 33). C, preincubation with the PLC inhibitor U73122 (10 μM) prevented SKF83959-evoked Ca²⁺ responses in MSN (*n* = 58).

increases in the average spike amplitude and spike frequency (Table I). These effects appear to be specific for IC peptide sequence, as loading with the control R9 peptide had no significant effects (*p* < 0.05) on the main properties of dopamine-induced Ca²⁺ oscillations in MSN (Table I). Thus, we conclude that disruption of InsP₃R1-PP1α association by the IC peptide has a significant potentiating effect on the amplitude and frequency of dopamine-induced Ca²⁺ oscillations in MSN.

A Role of InsP₃R1-AKAP9-PKA Association in Dopamine-induced Ca²⁺ Oscillations—PKA phosphorylation increases InsP₃R1 sensitivity to InsP₃ (35, 37–39). In recent biochemical experiments, we demonstrated the formation of a InsP₃R1·AKAP9·PKA ternary complex in the brain (40). We found that InsP₃R1-AKAP9 association is mediated via the LIZ motif in the InsP₃R1 coupling domain and the fourth LIZ motif in AKAP9 (40). We further showed that InsP₃R1-AKAP9 association is disrupted in the presence of the recombinant LIZ fragment of InsP₃R1 (RT1-LIZ) (40). To evaluate the functional consequences of InsP₃R1-AKAP9-PKA association for dopamine-induced Ca²⁺ signaling, we transiently expressed the EGFP-RT1-LIZ construct in MSN. As a negative control, MSN cultures were transfected with the EGFP plasmid. MSN transfected with EGFP or EGFP-RT1-LIZ were identified by GFP imaging as we described previously (42).

**FIG. 7. Dopamine-induced Ca²⁺ oscillations are primed by activation of 5-HT₂ receptors.** The images were collected in ACSF containing 2 μM TTX and analyzed as described in the Fig. 1 legend. A, application of 50 μM α-methyl-5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT₂ receptor-specific agonist) caused an instant single Ca²⁺ spike in rat MSN (*n* = 24). B, 100 μM dopamine was not sufficient to induce any Ca²⁺ response in naïve MSN (*n* = 78). C, 100 μM dopamine induced Ca²⁺ oscillations in MSN primed with 50 μM α-methyl-5-hydroxytryptamine 5 min prior to dopamine application (*n* = 38).

We found that 400 μM dopamine induced Ca²⁺ oscillations in MSN transfected with either EGFP (Fig. 9C) or EGFP-RT1-LIZ (Fig. 9D). However, compared with EGFP-transfected MSN, Ca²⁺ oscillations in EGFP-RT1-LIZ-transfected MSN started after a longer delay and occurred with a reduced frequency (Fig. 9, *C* and *D*). Statistical analysis revealed that the average basal Ca²⁺ levels were similar (*p* > 0.05) in control (untransfected), EGFP-transfected, and EGFP-RT1-LIZ-transfected MSN (Table I). The average latency from dopamine application to the first Ca²⁺ spike was equal to 5.1 ± 2.2 min (*n* = 29) in control (untransfected) MSN, 4 ± 2.8 min (*n* = 11) in EGFP-transfected MSN, and 16.2 ± 2.1 min (*n* = 9) in EGFP-RT1-LIZ-transfected MSN (Table I). The amplitude of Ca²⁺ transients was lower in EGFP-RT1-LIZ-transfected neurons than in control (untransfected) or EGFP-transfected neurons, but the difference did not reach a level of statistical significance (*p* > 0.05, unpaired *t* test) (Table I). The average frequency of Ca²⁺ transients was equal to 12 ± 6 spikes/20 min (*n* = 29) in control (untransfected) MSN, 15 ± 4 spikes/20 min (*n* = 11) in EGFP-transfected MSN, and 7 ± 3 spikes/20 min (*n* = 9) in EGFP-RT1-LIZ-transfected MSN (Table I).

EGFP-RT1-LIZ in MSN resulted in a significantly (p < 0.05) longer latency duration and reduced spiking frequency (Table I). Expression of EGFP alone had no significant effects (p < 0.05) on the main properties of dopamine-induced Ca²⁺ oscillations in MSN compared with control (untransfected) cells (Table I), indicating that the observed effects are specific for the RT1-LIZ sequence.

A Role of DARPP-32 in Dopamine-induced Ca²⁺ Oscillations—DARPP-32 (59) is a regulatory phosphoprotein that has been suggested to play a key role in dopaminergic signaling in the striatum by regulating PP1 activity (1). In contrast to other components of the dopaminergic signaling pathway, no pharmacological blockers of DARPP-32 function are currently available. To evaluate the importance of DARPP-32 in dopamine-induced Ca²⁺ signals, we took advantage of DARPP-32 knockout mice (26, 41). Western blot experiments with anti-DARPP-32 monoclonal antibodies confirmed the presence of the DARPP-32 protein in striatal lysates prepared from the wild-type (D32⁺/⁺) mouse pups, but not from the knockout (D32⁻/⁻) mouse pups (Fig. 10, A and B).

We established primary MSN cultures from the wild-type (D32⁺/⁺) and knock-out (D32⁻/⁻) embryonic brains and analyzed dopamine-induced Ca²⁺ signals in 16–18 DIV MSN by Ca²⁺ imaging with the Fura-2 indicator. Application of 400 μM dopamine induced repetitive Ca²⁺ transients (oscillations) in wild-type mouse MSN (Fig. 10C) and in D32⁻/⁻ MSN (Fig. 10D), similar to rat MSN (Fig. 1). Compared with wild-type (D32⁺/⁺) mouse MSN, oscillations in D32⁻/⁻ mouse MSN had a similar amplitude (Fig. 10, C and D). However, compared with wild-type MSN, oscillations in D32⁻/⁻ mouse MSN started with a longer delay after dopamine application and had a reduced frequency of oscillations (Fig. 10, C and D). Statistical analysis revealed that the main parameters of dopamine-induced Ca²⁺ spikes were not significantly different (p > 0.05) between wild-type mouse MSN and rat MSN (Table I). Furthermore, the average basal Ca²⁺ levels and the average amplitude of Ca²⁺ transients were similar (p > 0.05) in D32⁺/⁺ and D32⁻/⁻ mouse MSN (Table I). In contrast, the average latency from dopamine application to the first Ca²⁺ spike was equal to 4.5 ± 2.1 min (n = 38) in wild-type MSN and 6.1 ± 2.5 min (n = 154) in D32⁻/⁻ mouse MSN (Table I). Also, the average frequency of Ca²⁺ transients was equal to 13 ± 6 spikes/20 min (n = 38) in wild-type MSN and 9 ± 4 spikes/20 min (n = 154) in D32⁻/⁻ mouse MSN (Table I). Thus, we conclude that genetic ablation of DARPP-32 leads to a statistically significant (p < 0.05) increase in the lag time between

DISCUSSION

Cross-talk between cAMP and Ca²⁺ signaling pathways plays an important role in dopaminergic signaling in the neostriatum (1). In this study, we have investigated dopamine-evoked Ca²⁺ signals in cultured striatal MSN. Our results have elucidated a connection between D1 class DAR activation and cAMP/Ca²⁺ signaling in MSN and provided insights into cellular mechanisms of dopamine function in striatum. The data obtained in our study are consistent with the model shown in Fig. 11. We propose that dopamine acts on D1/D5 receptors, leading to activation of adenylyl cyclase, production of cAMP, and activation of PKA (3). PKA phosphorylates DARPP-32 and Inhibitor-1 proteins, converting them into potent inhibitors of PP1 (1). Activation of PKA and inhibition of PP1 lead to increased phosphorylation and activation of L-type Ca²⁺ channels, NMDA receptors, and AMPA receptors (16, 17, 21–23) and InsP₃R1 (39). We recently discovered an association of neuronal InsP₃R1 with AKAP9·PKA, which is mediated by a LIZ motif in the InsP₃R1 sequence (40). EGFP-RT1-LIZ transfection experiments (Fig. 9, C and D) demonstrated that the PKA associated with InsP₃R1·AKAP9 plays a major role in dopamine-induced InsP₃R1 phosphorylation in MSN. PKA phosphorylation of Ca²⁺ influx channels and InsP₃R1 is necessary but not sufficient to result in Ca²⁺ oscillations. As experiments with the PLC antagonist U73122 demonstrated (Fig. 5), activation of PLC is also required. Previous studies demonstrated coupling of D2 class DARs to InsP₃ production and

Ca²⁺ release in striatal neurons (7). However, dopamine-induced Ca²⁺ oscillations in our experiments were mediated by D1 class (cAMP-coupled), not by D2 class (PLC-coupled), DARs (Figs. 2 and 3).

We propose two potential solutions to this apparent contradiction (see Fig. 11). One possibility is that dopamine acts on a putative PLC-linked D1 class DAR (9, 10, 60). Indeed, SKF83959, a specific agonist for this putative PLC-linked D1 class DAR (11), induced Ca²⁺ release from intracellular stores in MSN (Fig. 6). Another possibility is that some fraction of D1/D5 receptors in MSN is associated with calcyon, which enables coupling of these receptors to Gq/11 and PLC (12, 13). In support of the calcyon hypothesis, priming of MSN with a 5-HT₂ receptor agonist facilitated dopamine-induced Ca²⁺ oscillations in our experiments (Fig. 7C). It has been previously reported that priming is not effective in striatal neurons (55). One potential explanation for this discrepancy is different ages of MSN cultures: 18–20 DIV in our experiments and 4–10 DIV in the experiments of Lezcano and Bergson (55). Indeed, in control experiments, we found that responsiveness of MSN to dopamine increased with maturity of culture (data not shown). It remains to be determined whether D1/D5 receptors complexed with calcyon (12, 13) and a putative PLC-linked D1 class DAR (8–11) are the same or distinct (as shown on Fig. 11) molecular entities.

Simultaneous activation of cAMP and InsP₃ signaling pathways leads to activation of InsP₃R1 (see Fig. 11). Interestingly, dopamine-induced Ca²⁺ oscillations started with a delay of ~5 min (Fig. 1). In contrast, activation of metabotropic glutamate type 1 and 5 receptors (42), D2 class DARs (Fig. 2F), 5-HT₂

A and B, Western blotting of striatal lysates from the wild-type (D32⁺/⁺) and DARPP-32 knock-out (D32⁻/⁻) pup brain lysates, respectively, with anti-DARPP-32 monoclonal antibodies.

receptors (Fig. 3C), and the putative PLC-coupled D1 class DAR (Fig. 6A) leads to an instant Ca²⁺ transient in MSN. The delay between application of dopamine and initiation of Ca²⁺ oscillations is similar to the delay between application of 8-Br-cAMP (PKA activator) and calyculin A (PP1 inhibitor) and changes in basal Ca²⁺ levels in MSN (Fig. 8, A and B). To explain these results, we reasoned that phosphorylation of InsP₃R1 by PKA is necessary for initiation of Ca²⁺ oscillations. PKA phosphorylation activates InsP₃R1 by increasing the sensitivity of InsP₃R1 to activation by InsP₃ (35, 37–39), and apparently, InsP₃ levels in dopamine-stimulated MSN are sufficient for activation of phosphorylated InsP₃R1, but not for activation of unphosphorylated InsP₃R1.

Following InsP₃R1 activation and release of Ca²⁺ from intracellular stores, the cytosolic Ca²⁺ concentration rises. InsP₃R1 is under feedback regulation by cytosolic Ca²⁺: low Ca²⁺ concentrations (<300 nM) activate InsP₃R1, and higher Ca²⁺ concentrations (>300 nM) inhibit InsP₃R1 (61–63). Thus, release of Ca²⁺ is expected to proceed in a highly cooperative manner and to terminate quickly due to Ca²⁺ inactivation of InsP₃R1. An increase in cytosolic Ca²⁺ will also lead to activation of the Ca²⁺-dependent phosphatase calcineurin (PP2B) (Fig. 11). Activated calcineurin dephosphorylates DARPP-32 and Inhibitor-1, resulting in disinhibition of PP1 (1), which in turn dephosphorylates and “turns off” InsP₃R1 (39) and Ca²⁺ influx channels (16, 17, 21–23). Our model predicts that InsP₃R1 must be phosphorylated by PKA again for the next Ca²⁺ spike to occur. Thus, in contrast to most models of Ca²⁺ oscillations, which are centered on biphasic modulation of InsP₃R1 by Ca²⁺ (64), dopamine-induced Ca²⁺ oscillations in MSN rely on an intricate interplay between Ca²⁺ and cAMP signaling pathways, leading to repetitive rounds of InsP₃R1 phosphorylation by PKA and dephosphorylation by PP1.

This hypothesis is supported by the effects of cyclosporin A (calcineurin inhibitor) on the phosphorylated state of striatal InsP₃R1 (39) and dopamine-induced Ca²⁺ oscillations in MSN (Fig. 8G). The proposed role of DARPP-32 is consistent with the analysis of dopamine-induced Ca²⁺ oscillations in MSN from DARPP-32 knock-out mice (Fig. 10). An increase in the lag time and a reduction in the frequency of Ca²⁺ oscillations (Fig. 10 (C and D) and Table I) are expected in the absence of DARPP-32, a condition that should favor PP1-mediated dephosphorylation of target proteins, including InsP₃R1. The relatively mild effects observed in MSN from DARPP-32 knock-out mice most likely result from the redundant functions of DARPP-32 and Inhibitor-1, both of which are expressed in the striatum (65, 66). The experiments with the competitive R9-IC peptide and EGFP-RT1-LIZ indicate that InsP₃R1-associated PP1α (39) and InsP₃R1·AKAP9-associated PKA (40) play a major role in the control of the phosphorylated state of InsP₃R1 (Fig. 9). Consistent with impaired PP1 function, MSN loaded with the R9-IC peptide displayed increased amplitude and frequency of dopamine-induced Ca²⁺ oscillations (Fig. 9 (A and B) and Table I). In contrast, disruption of the InsP₃R1·AKAP9·PKA complex by overexpressed EGFP-RT1-LIZ resulted in delayed Ca²⁺ oscillations and reduced spike frequency (Fig. 9 (C and D) and Table I).

Previous studies suggested an important role of L-type Ca²⁺ channels, NMDA receptors, and AMPA receptors in the cross-talk between cAMP and Ca²⁺ signaling in striatal neurons (16, 17, 21–23). We also observed that maintenance of dopamine-induced Ca²⁺ oscillations requires Ca²⁺ influx from the extracellular space (Fig. 4A) and established a role of L-type Ca²⁺ channels, NMDA receptors, and AMPA receptors in mediating Ca²⁺ influx (Fig. 4, C–F). If Ca²⁺ influx is blocked, Ca²⁺ oscillations can be initiated, but cannot be maintained (Fig. 4, B and

Dopamine and Ca²⁺ Signaling in MSN

FIG. 11. Model of D1 class DAR-mediated cAMP, InsP₃, and Ca²⁺ signaling in MSN. Application of dopamine activates D1/D5 receptors, leading to activation of adenylyl cyclase, production of cAMP, and activation of PKA. Actions of dopamine can be mimicked by the D1 receptor-specific agonist SKF38393 and prevented by the D1 receptor-specific antagonist SCH23390, but not by the D2 receptor-specific antagonist spiperone. Activated PKA phosphorylates DARPP-32 and Inhibitor-1, converting them into potent inhibitors of PP1 (1). Activation of PKA and inhibition of PP1 lead to increased phosphorylation and activation of Ca²⁺ influx channels (L-type Ca²⁺ channels (CaCh)), NMDA receptors (NMDAR), and AMPA receptors (AMPAR) and InsP₃R1. InsP₃R1 is associated with AKAP9·PKA via the LIZ motif (40) and with PP1α via the C-terminal IC peptide region (39). Dopamine also acts on a putative PLC-linked D1 class DAR (activated by SKF83959) (11) and/or a PLC-coupled D1/D5 receptor-calcyon complex (12). Formation of a D1/D5 receptor-calcyon complex is promoted by priming of MSN with 5-HT₂ receptor agonist (not shown). It remains to be determined whether D1/D5 receptors complexed with calcyon (12, 13) and a putative PLC-linked D1 class DAR (8–11) are the same or distinct (as shown) molecular entities. Simultaneous activation of cAMP and InsP₃ signaling pathways leads to activation of InsP₃R1 (39), which is under biphasic regulation by Ca²⁺ (61–63). An increase in cytosolic Ca²⁺ activates calcineurin (PP2B), which dephosphorylates DARPP-32 and Inhibitor-1, resulting in disinhibition of PP1 (1), which in turn dephosphorylates InsP₃R1 and Ca²⁺ influx channels. Ca²⁺ influx via L-type Ca²⁺ channels, NMDA receptors, and AMPA receptors and SERCA pump activity are necessary to prevent depletion of intracellular Ca²⁺ stores during oscillations. The proposed model indicates that dopamine-induced Ca²⁺ oscillations in MSN rely on an intricate interplay between Ca²⁺ and cAMP signaling pathways, leading to repetitive rounds of InsP₃R1 phosphorylation by PKA and dephosphorylation by PP1. The model is supported by pharmacological experiments (U73122, PLC blocker; calyculin A (CalA), PP1 blocker; cyclosporin A (CsA), PP2B blocker; thapsigargin, SERCA blocker; (+)-MK801, NMDA receptor blocker; CNQX, AMPA receptor blocker; and nifedipine, L-type Ca²⁺ channel blocker), effects of competitive R9-IC and EGFP-RT1-LIZ peptides, and analysis of DARPP-32 knock-out (KO) mice.

C). These results indicate that the most likely role of Ca²⁺ influx via L-type Ca²⁺ channels, NMDA receptors, and AMPA receptors is to prevent depletion of intracellular Ca²⁺ stores. Indeed, application of the SERCA pump inhibitor thapsigargin resulted in rapid cessation of dopamine-induced Ca²⁺ oscillations (Fig. 5, C and D), indicating that the Ca²⁺ stores in MSN can be easily depleted. Similar conclusions have been reached earlier for Ca²⁺ oscillations induced by application of gonadotropin-releasing hormone to cultured gonadotrophs (67). Thus, it appears that for both MSN and gonadotrophs, Ca²⁺ oscillations are driven by InsP₃-mediated Ca²⁺ release from the endoplasmic reticulum, but that Ca²⁺ influx via plasma membrane Ca²⁺ channels is necessary for endoplasmic reticulum refilling to maintain the oscillations.

In conclusion, using a Ca²⁺ imaging technique, we have described dopamine-induced Ca²⁺ oscillatory responses in MSN. The dopamine-induced Ca²⁺ oscillations are mediated primarily by D1 class DARs and require an intricate interplay between cAMP, InsP₃, and Ca²⁺ signaling pathways, which converge on InsP₃R1 regulation (Fig. 11). Direct association of InsP₃R1 with PP1α (39) and formation of the InsP₃R1·AKAP9·PKA complex (40) are important for fidelity of cAMP, InsP₃, and Ca²⁺ cross-talk. Future experiments will be needed to further test our model (Fig. 11) and to understand the possible physiological relevance of dopamine-induced Ca²⁺ oscillations for striatal function.
