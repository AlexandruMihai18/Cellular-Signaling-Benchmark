A role for protein kinase C (PKC) isotypes is implicated in the activation of phagocytic cell functions. An antisense approach was used to selectively deplete β-PKC, both βI- and βII-PKC, but not α-PKC, δ-PKC, or ζ-PKC in HL60 cells differentiated to a neutrophil-like phenotype (dHL60 cells). Depletion of β-PKC in dHL60 cells elicited selective inhibition of O₂ generation triggered by fMet-Leu-Phe, immune complexes, or phorbol myristate acetate, an activator of PKC. In contrast, neither ligand-elicited β-glucuronidase (azurophil granule) release nor adherence to fibronectin was inhibited by β-PKC depletion. Ligand-induced phosphorylation of a subset of proteins was reduced in β-PKC-depleted dHL60 cells. Phosphorylation of p47phox and translocation of p47phox to the membrane are essential for activation of the NADPH oxidase and generation of O₂. β-PKC depletion had no effect on the level of p47phox in dHL60 cells but did significantly decrease ligand-induced phosphorylation of this protein. Furthermore, translocation of p47phox to the membrane in response to phorbol myristate acetate or fMet-Leu-Phe was reduced in β-PKC-depleted cells. These results indicate that β-PKC is essential for signaling for O₂ generation but not cell adherence or azurophil degranulation. Depletion of β-PKC inhibited ligand-induced phosphorylation of p47phox, translocation of p47phox to the membrane, and activation of O₂ generation.

kinases, acts in multiple signal transduction pathways. The cofactor requirements differ between different classes of PKC isotypes. Classical α-, β-, and γ-PKC are acidic phospholipid, diglyceride (DG), and Ca²⁺-dependent; novel forms δ-, ε-, θ-, and η-PKC also require acidic phospholipid and DG, but are Ca²⁺ independent. The atypical PKC isotypes, ζ- and λ-PKC, require PS but are DG and Ca²⁺ independent (9–14). PKC isotypes differ in their tissue distribution and localization within the cell, suggesting that each isotype plays a specific role in signal transduction.

Neutrophils, monocytes/macrophages, and dHL60 cells contain multiple isotypes of PKC, including Ca²⁺-dependent isotypes α-PKC, βI-PKC, and βII-PKC, Ca²⁺-independent DG-dependent isotype, δ-PKC, and atypical PS-dependent, Ca²⁺/DG-independent ζ-PKC (3, 14–16). PKC has been implicated in the signaling for several different responses of phagocytic cells because PMA triggers O₂ generation and adherence but not the release of azurophil granules (1, 17). The PKC substrates involved in these processes are largely unknown. The cytoskeleton and integrins are involved in cell adherence, and several cytoskeletal proteins, including MARCKS, are PKC substrates (8). Assembly of an active NADPH oxidase for generation of O₂ requires translocation of cytosolic factors p47phox, p67phox, and rac2 to the plasma membrane, where they interact with the integral membrane protein cytochrome b₅₅₈ (18–25). p47phox is phosphorylated in ligand-activated phagocytic cells. p47phox contains multiple phosphorylation sites, including a number of classical PKC substrate sites (RXXS/TXRX) and is phosphorylated by β-PKC in vitro (3). In addition, p47phox phosphorylated in vitro by PKC, but not cAMP-activated kinase or mitogen-activated kinase, was active in a cell-free system for activation of the NADPH oxidase (4–7). However, in vitro activity does not necessarily predict a role for a particular PKC isotype in the intact cell, where access to both substrate and cofactors is critical in controlling signaling specificity. Specific functions for each PKC isotype remain to be established.

In the present study, an antisense strategy was used to probe a role for a specific PKC isotype in signaling for the ligand-activated responses of O₂ generation and cell adherence in dHL60 cells. β-PKC was selectively depleted by an antisense strategy in dHL60 cells. Selective depletion of β-PKC in dHL60 cells decreased O₂ generation but not degranulation or adherence. Depletion of β-PKC reduced ligand-induced phosphorylation of a subset of proteins including p47phox and reduced translocation of p47phox to the membrane, concordant with a selective role for β-PKC in signaling for assembly of an active NADPH oxidase.

Protein kinase C (PKC)¹ mediates signaling for multiple functions of phagocytic cells, neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, and differentiated HL60 (dHL60) cells. Ligands such as the chemotactic peptide fMet-Leu-Phe and phagocytic stimuli (immune complexes) trigger responses that include O₂ generation, degranulation, adherence, and actin filament assembly (1–8). These functions are essential for the microbicidal activity of phagocytic cells and are also proinflammatory.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Reagents—Cytochalasin B, cytochrome c, phenolphthalein glucoronidate, protease inhibitors (leupeptin and aprotinin), BSA, PMA, fMet-Leu-Phe, and PMSF were purchased from Sigma. PMA was stored as a concentrated stock solution in Me₂SO and diluted with Krebs-

Ringer buffer before use. fMet-Leu-Phe was stored as a stock solution in ethanol and diluted in buffer prior to use. BSA and anti-BSA IgG (Cappel, Durham, NC) were used to form an immune complex by the method of Ward and Zvaifler (26).

Anti-peptide polyclonal antibodies to α-PKC, βI-PKC, βII-PKC, γ-PKC, δ-PKC, ε-PKC, θ-PKC, and η-PKC and peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Mouse monoclonal antibodies to δ-PKC and ζ-PKC and a rabbit polyclonal antibody to p47phox were purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). A mouse monoclonal antibody to p47phox and a rabbit polyclonal antibody to gp91phox were gifts from J. Curnutte (Genentech). Protein A-agarose was obtained from Life Technologies, Inc.

**HL60 Cell Culture**—Human promyelocytic HL60 leukemic cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). The cells were grown in suspension culture in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine, 1% nonessential amino acids, 1% minimal essential medium vitamin solution, 0.1% gentamicin, and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. The cell cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a 5% CO₂ humidified atmosphere.

**Oligonucleotide Synthesis and Sequences**—An antisense oligonucleotide was designed against the translation start site of human β-PKC using the commercial primer analysis software Oligo (National Biosciences). Since βI-PKC and βII-PKC differ only in the 3′ terminus, this oligonucleotide should target both forms of β-PKC. A 19-mer sequence was chosen, which was without significant self-complementarity and did not dimerize. The chosen sequence was also optimized for maximal Tm to promote high affinity binding to mRNA; a Tₘ of 70.0 °C was calculated at 150 mM salt and 37 °C. The 19-mer oligonucleotides had the following sequences: β-PKC antisense (βAS), 5′-AGC CGG GTC AGC CAT CTT G-3′, β-PKC sense (βSS), 5′-C AAG ATG GCT GAC CCG GCT-3′. The unique nature of these sequences was confirmed by searching the GenBank data base. Antisense, sense, and scrambled control oligonucleotides were synthesized by the PENN Nucleic Acid Facility as the phosphorothioate derivatives and purified by high pressure liquid chromatography. In all oligonucleotides, the internucleotide linkages were completely phosphorothioate-modified.

**Treatment of Cells with Oligonucleotides**—Delivery of the oligonucleotides was enhanced equally with cationic lipids DMRIE-C (1,2-dimyristoyloxypropyl-3-dimethyl-hydroxyethyl ammonium bromide/cholesterol (1:1 (M/M))) and Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.); however, DMRIE-C was chosen since this lipid lacks dioctanoyl phosphatidylethanolamine, which can be toxic to phagocytic cells, and allowed optimal retention of cell functions (27). HL60 cells were cultured in the presence of 1.3% Me₂SO for 4 days to initiate differentiation before treatment with the oligonucleotide. On day 4, the cells were washed and resuspended in Opti-MEM I reduced serum medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) at a cell concentration of 25 × 10⁶ cells/well. Oligonucleotides βAS, βSS, or βMS (a scrambled AS oligonucleotide) were suspended in Opti-MEM at a final concentration of 100–1000 nM and mixed with the cationic lipid DMRIE-C (2.5 μg/ml). The cationic lipid/oligonucleotide mixture was added to the cells and incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. An equal volume of RPMI 1640 medium containing 20% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum plus Me₂SO (1.3% final concentration) was then added, and the cells cultured for 20 h. On day 5, the cells were washed and resuspended in fresh Opti-MEM and treated again with the cationic lipid/oligonucleotide mixture. Following 4 h of incubation, an equal volume of RPMI 1640 medium containing 20% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum plus Me₂SO (1.3% final concentration) was then added, and the cells were cultured for an additional 24 h. The cells were harvested and suspended in Krebs-Ringer phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, containing 1.2 mM Mg²⁺ and 1.3 mM Ca²⁺.

**Western Blots**—Differentiated HL60 cell lysates (1 × 10⁶ cells/sample) were prepared by heating the cells at 95 °C for 5 min in 2 × SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The samples were briefly sonicated (12 s) to reduce viscosity. The dHL60 cell lysates were run on a 4–16% gradient SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF membrane, and blocked for 1 h at room temperature with Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.5, containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 1% BSA, 3% casein. To identify the different PKC isotypes, the membrane was incubated with a panel of PKC antibodies, followed by incubation with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG. Immunoreactive bands were visualized by Pierce SuperSignal ULTRA chemiluminescence substrate. The software SigmaProscan (Jandel/SPSS) was used for densitometric analysis; rhPKC isotypes (Pan Vera) were used as standards for quantitation.

**Protein Kinase C Assay**—Cytosol fractions were prepared by sonicating dHL60 cells in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 2 mM PMSF, 33 μM leupeptin, 35 μM antipain, 24 μg/ml chymostatin, 35 μM pepstatin, and 0.48 TIU/ml aprotinin, 10 mM EGTA, and 50 mM mercaptoethanol, as described previously (2), and by centrifuging for 20 min at 115,000 × g at 4 °C. PKC activity of cytosol fractions was assayed in the presence of Ca²⁺, PS, and DG by measuring the incorporation of ³²P into histone type IIIS or into PKC substrate peptide [Ser²⁵]PKC(19–31) (2). The net Ca²⁺-dependent activity was obtained by subtraction of the Ca²⁺-independent, PS/DG activity from the Ca²⁺/PS/DG-dependent activity.

**Superoxide Anion Generation**—The generation of superoxide anion (O₂⁻) by dHL60 cells was measured as superoxide dismutase-inhibitable cytochrome *c* reduction by either a continuous recording method (28) or end point analysis. Cells were activated by 1 μM fMet-Leu-Phe in the presence of 5 μg/ml cytochalasin B, or by 1 μg/ml PMA, or 300 μg/ml BSA/anti-BSA immune complex in the absence of cytochalasin B.

**Degranulation**—The release of the azurophil granule-associated enzyme β-glucuronidase triggered by fMet-Leu-Phe from dHL60 cells was measured in the presence of 5 μg/ml cytochalasin B to allow extracellular release of granule contents. Degranulation triggered by insoluble immune complex, BSA/anti-BSA, was measured in the absence of cytochalasin B. dHL60 cells (5 × 10⁶ cells/ml) were incubated for 5 min at 37 °C with buffer, fMet-Leu-Phe (1 μM) or BSA/anti-BSA (300 μg/ml). β-Glucuronidase was determined by a microplate assay using phenolphthalein glucuronide as substrate (29, 30). Total enzyme activities were determined simultaneously in reaction mixtures containing the detergent Triton X-100 (0.2%) and using phenolphthalein to calibrate the nmoles of cleaved substrate.

**Adherence**—Adherence of dHL60 cells to fibronectin-coated plates was determined by a colorimetric assay according to the method of Aumailley *et al.* (31). 96-well microtiter plates were coated with fibronectin as described by Nathan *et al.* (32). dHL60 cells (4 × 10⁵ cells/well) were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with either buffer, fMet-Leu-Phe (1 μM) or PMA (1 μg/ml). Nonadherent cells were removed by washing with Krebs-Ringer phosphate-buffered saline buffer, and the adherent cells were fixed with 70% ethanol. The bound cells were stained with crystal violet (0.1% in dH₂O). The plates were washed extensively to remove excess stain, and the cells were solubilized with 1% Nonidet P-40 in dH₂O. Optical density was read at 550 nm.

**Protein Phosphorylation in Activated dHL60 Cells**—dHL60 cells (50 × 10⁶ cells/ml) were incubated for 60 min at 37 °C with ³²P-Pᵢ (250 μCi of [³²P]orthophosphoric acid/ml). The ³²P-labeled cells were stimulated with either buffer alone or fMet-Leu-Phe (1 μM) for 1 min in the presence of 5 μg/ml cytochalasin B. The reaction was stopped by placing the samples on ice. Cell lysates were prepared and run on 4–12% gradient SDS-PAGE. The gel was dried and subjected to autoradiography.

**Immunoprecipitation of p47phox**—dHL60 cells (10 × 10⁶ cells/ml) were incubated for 60 min at 37 °C with ³²P-Pᵢ (250 μCi of [³²P]orthophosphoric acid/ml). The ³²P-labeled cells were stimulated with either buffer alone, PMA (1 μg/ml) or fMet-Leu-Phe (1 μM), for 10 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of cold immunoprecipitation (IP) buffer. IP buffer consisted of 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.4) containing 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 2 mM PMSF, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 0.027 TIU/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 mg/ml BSA. The samples were then vortexed for 20 min to solubilize the membrane fraction, and the supernatant was collected after microfuging for 5 min. A rabbit polyclonal antibody to p47phox was added and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Protein A-agarose was added and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with shaking. The reaction tubes were then microfuged for 30 s, and the supernatants were discarded. The protein A-agarose pellet was washed four times with IP buffer, and the sample was eluted by incubation for 20 min at 65 °C in 2 × SDS-PAGE sample buffer.

**Preparation of Particulate Fractions from fMet-Leu-Phe-stimulated dHL60 Cells and Translocation of p47phox and PKC Isotypes to Cell Membranes**—dHL60 cells (2.5 × 10⁷ cells/ml) were incubated at 37 °C in the presence of buffer, 1 μM fMet-Leu-Phe (1 min) or 1 μg/ml PMA (5 min). At the end of the incubation period, the cell suspension was transferred to an ice bath. The suspension was then centrifuged for 10 min at 300 × g, and the cell pellet was resuspended in buffer containing 131 mM NaCl, 1 mM EGTA, 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 2 mM PMSF, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, and 20 μg/ml pepstatin (buffer A) (24). The cells were disrupted using three 5-s bursts of a microprobe sonicator at low power at 4 °C and centrifuged at low speed (500 × g, 5 min) to remove unbroken cells and nuclei. The supernatant was layered over a 15% sucrose cushion made up in buffer A and centrifuged at 4 °C for 20 min at 115,000 × g. The supernatant (cytosol) was mixed 4:1 with 4 × SDS sample buffer. The pellet was solubilized in hot Laemmli buffer; pellet (10 × 10⁶ cell equivalents/lane) and cytosol (3 × 10⁶ cell equivalents/lane) were run on 4–12% SDS-

RESULTS

Depletion of β-PKC Isotypes by Antisense Treatment—To deplete β-PKC, dHL60 cells were first treated with 1.3% Me₂SO for 4 days to initiate differentiation, followed by two treatments with β-PKC antisense oligonucleotide (βAS) and the cationic lipid DMRIE-C (2.5 μg/ml) at 24-h intervals (see “Materials and Methods”). Preliminary experiments demonstrated that cationic lipids were essential to enhance the potency of the oligonucleotides (33, 34). Phosphorothioate oligonucleotides were synthesized since these have a greater intracellular half-life than the native oligonucleotides. Since the half-life of PKC is long, reported to vary from 6.7 h to over 24 h, prolonged treatment with βAS was used (35). The cells were treated twice with the βAS/DMRIE-C mixture to prolong the exposure to βAS and to achieve decreased protein expression of β-PKC (35); a single treatment with βAS/DMRIE-C was not effective. The effect of antisense treatment on dHL60 cells following differentiation was examined over a concentration range of 0–1000 nM βAS (Fig. 1). Treatment with βAS resulted in decreased expression of β-PKC (Fig. 1). Depletion of β-PKC followed a bell-shaped concentration response curve; maximal depletion of β-PKC immunoreactivity occurred at 250 and 500 nM βAS (Fig. 1). For this experiment, β-PKC was reduced to 23 and 31% of control levels by 250 and 500 nM βAS, respectively. At higher concentrations of βAS oligonucleotide, there was increased β-PKC expression. Attempts to enhance the depletion of β-PKC by more prolonged incubation or by increases in cationic lipid levels were not successful due to a loss of cell viability.

Selective Depletion of β-PKC and Not α-PKC, δ-PKC, or ζ-PKC—dHL60 contained numerous PKC isotypes, α-PKC, βI-PKC, βII-PKC, δ-PKC, and ζ-PKC, in agreement with other workers (Fig. 2A) (15). The predominant isotypes were α-, βII-, and δ-PKC, whereas βI-PKC and ζ-PKC were present at lower levels (Fig. 2A). No evidence for ε-PKC (Fig. 2A), γ-PKC, η-PKC, or θ-PKC (results not shown) was found in dHL60 cells. dHL60 cells were treated for 48 h with 300 nM β-PKC antisense (βAS) and β-PKC missense oligonucleotide (βMS) in the presence of DMRIE-C (2.5 μg/ml). Selectivity of depletion of β-PKC was assessed by probing the blot with antibodies to α-PKC, βI-PKC, βII-PKC, δ-PKC, and ζ-PKC. Both β-PKC isotypes, βI-PKC and βII-PKC, were effectively depleted by βAS treatment but not by βMS treatment (Fig. 2B) or in sense oligonucleotide-treated cells (results not shown). βI-PKC was reduced to 45.6 ± 5.3% (n = 10) of control (βMS) levels, and βII-PKC was reduced to 60.8 ± 4.4% (n = 10) of control levels. In contrast, a concentration of βAS, which was effective in depleting β-PKC, had no effect on the expression of other PKC isoforms including α-PKC, δ-PKC, and ζ-PKC (Fig. 2B). Calcium/PS/DG-dependent histone IIIs phosphorylating activity was 21.6 pmol/10⁷ cell equivalents/min in cytosol from control βMS-treated cells; calcium/PS/DG-dependent phosphorylating activity in β-PKC-depleted cells was reduced to 73.6 ± 1.7% (n = 3, p < 0.001) of control activity. This finding demonstrates that

Cell lysates were prepared from dHL60 cells, run on a 4–15% gradient SDS-PAGE, and blotted to PVDF membrane. Western blotting was performed using polyclonal antibodies to α-, βI-, βII-, δ-, and ε-PKC and a monoclonal antibody to ζ-PKC. B, selective depletion of β-PKC by a β-PKC antisense oligonucleotide. dHL60 cells were treated with 300 nM β-PKC antisense oligonucleotide (βAS) or β-PKC missense oligonucleotide (βMS) in the presence of 2.5 μg/ml DMRIE-C (see “Materials and Methods”). Cell lysates were prepared by adding Laemmli buffer, and the samples were subjected to 4–16% SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting (representative experiment of four). Molecular weight markers are indicated on the left, and PKC is indicated by an arrow on the right.

βAS depleted, but did not abolish, calcium-dependent PKC activity. Thus, treatment with the β-PKC antisense oligonucleotide selectively depleted dHL60 cells of β-PKC but not calcium-dependent α-PKC or calcium-independent δ-PKC and ζ-PKC.

Effect of β-PKC Depletion on Superoxide Anion Generation by dHL60 Cells—Activation of dHL60 cells by a variety of stimuli elicits the assembly of an active NADPH oxidase enzyme complex, which generates superoxide anion (O₂⁻). Previous studies suggested that β-PKC may play an important role in the activation of the NADPH oxidase (3, 20). Therefore, the effect of β-PKC depletion on O₂⁻ generation triggered by different ligands was evaluated. The PKC activator PMA (1 μg/ml) triggered continuous generation of O₂⁻ by dHL60 cells following a lag period of approximately 1–3 min (Fig. 3A). The mean lag period for control βMS-treated cells was 205 ± 55 s (n = 5); the lag period was significantly increased to 222 ± 43% (n = 5) of control (p < 0.05) in βAS-treated cells. Thus, depletion of β-PKC delayed the onset of O₂⁻ generation in PMA-activated cells. Control βMS-treated cells generated 33.5 ± 6.2 nmol (n = 5) O₂⁻/10⁶ cells/15 min (Fig. 3C). Treatment of cells with DMRIE-C/oligonucleotide was not toxic to the cells since the rate of O₂⁻ generation in the absence of DMRIE-C/oligonucleotide was 39.14 ± 5.7 (n = 4) nmol O₂⁻/10⁶ cells/15 min as compared with the rate of 33.50 ± 6.2 (n = 5) nmol O₂⁻/10⁶ cells/15 min in DMRIE-C/βMS-treated cells, a difference that is

Data shown are representative of five experiments (PMA), eight experiments (fMLP), and three experiments (BSA/anti-BSA) and are expressed as nmol O₂/10⁶ cells/15 min.

not significant. When dHL60 cells were treated with βAS (Fig. 2B), PMA-elicited O₂ production was significantly decreased to a level of 25.1 ± 6.2 (n = 5) nmol O₂/10⁶ cells/15 min (p < 0.01), a level that was 71.6 ± 7.8% of control (p < 0.02) (Fig. 3C). In addition, the V_max of PMA-induced O₂ generation, defined as the maximal rate of O₂ generation, was reduced in cells depleted of β-PKC. Calculation of the V_max demonstrated that in βMS-treated cells activated by 1 μg/ml PMA, the V_max was

2.51 ± 0.80 (n = 5) nmol/min/10⁶ cells; the V_max of β-PKC-depleted cells was significantly reduced to 2.04 ± 0.70 nmol/min/10⁶ cells (n = 5), which was 75.8 ± 7.8% of control βMS-treated cells (p < 0.04).

The chemotactic peptide, fMet-Leu-Phe (1 μM), triggers O₂ generation by dHL60 cells in the presence of cytochalasin B (Fig. 3B). The onset of O₂ generation was rapid but ceased after 3–4 min. (Fig. 3B). Control (βMS-treated) cells activated by 1 μM fMet-Leu-Phe generated 16.88 ± 2.6 nmol/10⁶ cells/15 min (n = 8) (Fig. 3C). O₂ generation was significantly decreased in β-PKC-depleted (βAS-treated) cells to 4.83 ± 2.1 nmol/10⁶ cells/15 min (n = 8) (p < 0.001), a level that was 28.5% of control values (p < 0.01) (Fig. 3C). The kinetics of inhibition O₂ generation following β-PKC depletion were examined in fMet-Leu-Phe-activated cells. The lag time of reaction was approximately 10–15 s. after addition of f-Met-Leu-Phe, and was not significantly altered by depletion of β-PKC. However, the V_max of fMet-Leu-Phe-induced O₂ generation was significantly decreased in β-PKC-depleted cells as compared with controls. The V_max of O₂ generation decreased significantly from a rate of 3.36 ± 0.57 nmol/min/10⁶ cells (n = 8) in control βMS-treated cells to a V_max of 1.45 ± 0.28 nmol/min/10⁶ cells (p < 0.002, n = 8) in β-PKC-depleted cells. Ligands such as immune complexes, in addition to fMet-Leu-Phe, also trigger O₂ generation by dHL60 cells. βAS treatment decreased O₂ generation in response to immune complex from 2.02 ± 0.14 nmol/10⁶ cells/15 min (n = 3) in βMS-treated cells to 1.04 ± 0.22 nmol/10⁶ cells/15 min (n = 3) in βAS-treated cells (Fig. 3C) and decreased the V_max from 0.68 ± 0.04 nmol/min/10⁶ cells (n = 3) to 0.35 ± 0.07 nmol/min/10⁶ cells (n = 3) (p < 0.01).

Thus, depletion of β-PKC in dHL60 cells results in inhibition of the rate of O₂ generation in response to a number of different ligands. The extent of inhibition of O₂ generation by β-PKC depletion was stimulus dependent; the greatest inhibition of O₂ generation by β-PKC depletion was observed in cells activated by fMet-Leu-Phe.

**Depletion of β-PKC Isotypes Does Not Inhibit fMet-Leu-Phe-Elicited Degranulation by dHL60 Cells—Activation of dHL60 cells with ligands such as fMet-Leu-Phe triggers release of β-glucuronidase, an azurophil granule marker, simultaneously with the generation of O₂. The effect of depletion of β-PKC on the extracellular release of β-glucuronidase was monitored in dHL60 cells following stimulation with 1 μM fMet-Leu-Phe. Treatment of dHL60 cells with βAS plus DMRIE-C, at a concentration that significantly depleted levels of β-PKC and inhibited O₂ production in response to fMet-Leu-Phe, had no significant effect on degranulation (Fig. 4); 10.5 ± 2.7% (n = 4) of total β-glucuronidase was released in response to fMet-Leu-Phe in control (βMS-treated) cells, whereas 12.2 ± 2.5% (n = 4) of total β-glucuronidase was released from β-PKC-depleted cells. Similarly, degranulation triggered by BSA/anti-BSA in the absence of cytochalasin B was not affected by depletion of β-PKC; 7.5 ± 0.2% (n = 4) of total β-glucuronidase was released in response to BSA/anti-BSA in control (βMS-treated) cells, whereas 8.3 ± 0.6% (n = 4) of total β-glucuronidase was released from β-PKC-depleted cells. Furthermore, total cell content of β-glucuronidase, a marker for HL60 cell differentiation, was not altered in β-PKC-depleted cells (Fig. 4). Therefore, depletion of β-PKC with a β-PKC antisense oligonucleotide selectively inhibits ligand-elicited O₂ generation but not β-glucuronidase release.**

The effect of depletion of β-PKC on the release of β-glucuronidase was monitored in missense (βMS) and antisense (βAS) pretreated dHL60 cells (see “Materials and Methods”). dHL60 cells were preincubated for 5 min at 37 °C before addition of 1 μM fMet-Leu-Phe; cytochalasin B was present at 5 μg/ml in all tubes. Results are expressed as nmol of glucuronate released/10⁶ cells, mean ± S.E. (n = 4).

dHL60 cells, the effect of β-PKC depletion on basal and stimulated adherence to fibronectin was examined in dHL60 cells. Activation of control (βMS-treated) cells by PMA (1 μg/ml) or fMet-Leu-Phe (1 μM) triggered increased cell adherence to fibronectin-coated wells (Fig. 5). PMA produced the greatest increase in adherence, to 242.1 ± 64.0% (n = 4) of resting levels in control (βMS-treated) cells, whereas in β-PKC-depleted cells, a similar level of PMA-induced adherence, 246.8 ± 40.0% (n = 4) of resting levels, was observed. fMet-Leu-Phe (1 μM) triggered increased adherence to 175.1 ± 41.5% (n = 3) of resting levels in control (βMS-treated) cells, whereas in β-PKC-depleted cells, a similar level of fMet-Leu-Phe-induced adherence, 214.38 ± 62.5% (n = 4) of resting levels, was observed. As shown in Fig. 5, βAS treatment under conditions that significantly altered fMet-Leu-Phe and PMA-induced O₂ production had no significant effect on cell adherence to fibronectin in unstimulated or stimulated cells. Thus, depletion of β-PKC in dHL60 cells elicits selective inhibition of O₂ generation but not β-glucuronidase release or adherence to fibronectin.

**Effect of β-PKC Depletion on Protein Phosphorylation Triggered by 1 μM fMet-Leu-Phe—βAS- and βMS-treated dHL60 cells were labeled with ³²P inorganic phosphate for 1 h at 37 °C and treated with buffer or fMet-Leu-Phe. Cell lysates were prepared, the phosphorylated proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE, and the gels were subjected to autoradiography. Activation of the cells for 1 min with 1 μM fMet-Leu-Phe triggered phosphorylation of multiple proteins, including 18-, 24-, 38-, 43-, 47-, 54-, 68-, and 80-kDa proteins (Fig. 6A). Phosphorylation of prominent 14-, 97-, and 105-kDa bands was not significantly altered in fMet-Leu-Phe-activated cells (Fig. 6A). Densitometry of the autoradiograph demonstrated that treatment of cells with antisense to β-PKC reduced the fMet-Leu-Phe-induced phosphorylation of the 18-, 38-, 43-, 47-, 54-, and 68-kDa proteins (Fig. 6B); the 47-kDa band is a candidate for p47phox. In contrast, phosphorylation of a band at 105 kDa was enhanced in β-PKC-depleted cells. The effect of β-PKC depletion on fMet-Leu-Phe-induced protein phosphorylation was selective, since treatment with βAS had no significant effect on the fMet-Leu-Phe-induced phosphorylation of the 24- or 80-kDa bands. These results suggest that depletion of β-PKC inhibits fMet-Leu-Phe-induced phosphorylation of a discrete number of proteins including a 47-kDa band, which is a candidate for**

Depletion of β-PKC and Reduced Ligand-initiated Phosphorylation of p47phox—Phosphorylation of p47phox and its translocation to the membrane-associated cytochrome b558 is essential for assembly of the NADPH oxidase. β-PKC-depleted dHL60 cells were used to determine whether β-PKC was essential for phosphorylation of p47phox in cells activated by fMet-Leu-Phe. dHL60 cells were pretreated with βAS or βMS and stimulated for 1 min with 1 μM fMet-Leu-Phe; the p47phox was then immunoprecipitated. Western blotting and densitometry analysis demonstrated that control (βMS) and β-PKC-depleted (βAS) dHL60 cells contained equivalent amounts of p47phox immunoreactivity (Fig. 7A). However, phosphorylation of the p47phox band was reduced in the βAS-treated dHL60 cells as compared with the control (βMS-treated) cells; 32P counts eluted from the βAS band were 56% of control levels measured in the βMS band (Fig. 7B). β-PKC-depleted cells contained equivalent protein levels of p47phox as compared with control cells. However, fMet-Leu-Phe-induced phosphorylation of p47phox was decreased in the β-PKC-depleted cells, concordant with a role for β-PKC in phosphorylation of p47phox in ligand-initiated signaling and in the assembly of an active NADPH oxidase.

Effect of βPKC Depletion on p47phox Translocation—Phosphorylation and translocation of p47phox to the membrane and association of phosphorylated p47phox with cytochrome b558 are essential steps in the assembly of an active NADPH oxidase complex. Activation of dHL60 cells by fMet-Leu-Phe or PMA elicited translocation of p47phox from the cytosol to the membrane fraction (Fig. 8). Depletion of β-PKC by βAS treatment was associated with decreased translocation of p47phox from the cytosol to the membrane in both fMet-Leu-Phe- and PMA-activated cells as compared with βMS-treated controls (Fig. 8). In contrast, the membrane-associated gp91phox subunit of cytochrome b558 was not affected by depletion of β-PKC (Fig. 8). In resting cells, βI-PKC and βII-PKC were predominantly in the cytosol (Fig. 8). Activation of dHL60 cells by 1 μM fMet-Leu-Phe for 1 min elicited translocation of both βI-PKC and βII-PKC from the cytosol to the membrane (Fig. 8). Activation of the cells with 1 μg/ml PMA for 5 min triggered an almost total disappearance of βI-PKC and βII-PKC from the cytosol

### DISCUSSION

A role for PKC is implicated in the signaling for proinflammatory responses of phagocytic cells such as generation of O₂⁻, actin assembly, and cell adherence. PKC is a family of structurally related isotypes that have different cofactor and substrate specificities (9, 10). It has therefore been suggested that different isotypes of PKC transduce different signals, although there is little evidence to date to indicate specific functions for each isotype of PKC.

Multiple isotypes of PKC were demonstrated in dHL60 cells including α-, βI-, βII-, δ-, and ζ-PKC, in agreement with other studies (15); the expression of these PKC isotypes is similar to the PKC isotypes observed in neutrophils (3, 14). In addition, the cofactors required for activation of PKC, calcium, DG and PIP₃, are elevated in ligand-activated phagocytic cells, indicating a potential role for these PKC isotypes in activating responses such as O₂⁻ generation and adherence (37–40).

A role for β-PKC in ligand-initiated responses was probed by selective depletion of the β-PKC isotypes. Selective depletion by antisense was used since difficulty in distinguishing primary and secondary effects may be seen in overexpression studies either of the wild-type isotype or of a dominant negative mutant (41). Selective depletion of β-PKC but not depletion of α-, δ-, or ζ-PKC was achieved using an antisense oligonucleotide designed against the translocation start site of β-PKC. This oligonucleotide depleted both βI-PKC and βII-PKC, which are derived by alternate splicing and only differ at the 3′ terminus. Depletion of β-PKC by 45–60% was associated with decreased O₂⁻ generation triggered by PMA, fMet-Leu-Phe, or immune complexes. The extent of inhibition of O₂⁻ generation in β-PKC-depleted cells was ligand dependent; the greatest inhibition was observed in fMet-Leu-Phe-activated cells and the smallest inhibition in PMA-activated cells. The greater degree of inhibition of O₂⁻ generation observed in response to fMet-Leu-Phe and immune complexes, as compared with PMA, may reflect differences in signaling initiated by these ligands. fMet-Leu-Phe may use β-PKC at more than one step in the signaling pathway. There is a noteworthy difference in the kinetics of O₂⁻ generation triggered by PMA, which is continuous, as compared with the fMet-Leu-Phe-induced response, which ceases after approximately 3 min (1, 17). In addition, continuous receptor occupancy is required to maintain fMet-Leu-Phe-induced O₂⁻ generation (42). Thus, a role for β-PKC might be involved in maintaining fMet-Leu-Phe-induced O₂⁻ generation. Finally, PMA is promiscuous and might recruit other PKC isotypes, whereas fMet-Leu-Phe may be constrained to recruit only β-PKC for a key step in activation of the NADPH oxidase.

The inhibitory effect of β-PKC depletion on O₂⁻ generation was functionally selective. The simultaneously elicited release of the azurophil granule markers, β-glucuronidase and elastase (results not shown), from fMet-Leu-Phe-activated cells was not decreased in β-PKC-depleted cells. This finding is concordant with previous findings that activators of PKC, such as PMA, do not trigger azurophil degranulation and that the kinase inhibitor staurosporine does not inhibit azurophil degranulation (17). These findings also demonstrate that β-PKC depletion did not have a nonspecific effect on signaling for cell activation.

dHL60 cells adhere to fibronectin by a β1 integrin (36); adherence of dHL60 cells to a fibronectin-coated surface was triggered by PMA and fMet-Leu-Phe. Depletion of β-PKC in dHL60 cells did not inhibit either PMA or fMet-Leu-Phe-induced adherence to fibronectin. Thus, signaling for adherence must use other isotypes of PKC such as α- or δ-PKC that, like β-PKC, are also activated by PMA.

Identifying key substrate(s) is important in defining a role for β-PKC in signal transduction. Addition of fMet-Leu-Phe to dHL60 cells triggered phosphorylation of numerous proteins. In β-PKC-depleted cells, phosphorylation of a subset of proteins was reduced in response to fMLP, indicating a selective effect of β-PKC depletion on ligand-induced phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of a cytosolic component of the NADPH oxidase, p47<sup>phox</sup>, and translocation and binding of p47<sup>phox</sup> to cytochrome b<sub>558</sub> are essential steps in ligand-initiated activation of the NADPH oxidase. Indeed, depletion of β-PKC reduced the fMet-Leu-Phe-induced phosphorylation of a 47-kDa band and phosphorylation of immunoprecipitated p47<sup>phox</sup>. However, the level of p47<sup>phox</sup>, which is a differentiation marker in HL60 cells, was not altered by depletion of β-PKC. Thus, phosphorylation of p47<sup>phox</sup> is triggered by β-PKC in activated dHL60 cells.

Phosphorylation of p47<sup>phox</sup> is required for a conformational change in p47<sup>phox</sup>, which releases binding of p47<sup>phox</sup> to itself and to p40<sup>phox</sup> (43), and allows translocation and binding of p47<sup>phox</sup> to membrane-associated cytochrome b<sub>558</sub> (43–46). In the present study, fMet-Leu-Phe and PMA triggered phosphorylation and translocation of p47<sup>phox</sup> from the cytosol to the membrane in dHL60 cells. In β-PKC-depleted dHL60 cells, the ligand-induced translocation of p47<sup>phox</sup> to the membrane was reduced, concordant with a role for β-PKC in the phosphorylation and translocation of p47<sup>phox</sup> to the membrane-associated cytochrome b<sub>558</sub> and activation of the NADPH oxidase. Several serines in the C terminus of p47<sup>phox</sup>, including Ser-303, Ser-304, and Ser-379, are consensus sequences for phosphorylation by PKC (47), and we have demonstrated that *in vitro* β-PKC phosphorylates p47<sup>phox</sup> (3). The importance of a role for phosphorylation of p47<sup>phox</sup> by PKC for assembly of an active NADPH oxidase was demonstrated in a neutrophil cell-free system (4). Phosphorylation of Ser-379 was essential for translocation of p47<sup>phox</sup> to the membrane and activation of the NADPH oxidase, whereas a double mutation of Ser-303 and Ser-304 inhibited oxidase activity but not translocation of p47<sup>phox</sup> (5, 6). The present finding that β-PKC depletion reduced both phosphorylation and translocation of p47<sup>phox</sup> suggests that Ser-379 was a target for phosphorylation by β-PKC.

Previous studies demonstrated translocation of β-PKC from cytosol to the membrane or cytoskeleton in PMA-activated neutrophils (3, 20, 48). Such translocation of PKC would allow β-PKC to access the activating lipid cofactors PS and DG, which are located in the membrane, as well as membrane-associated substrates. In the present study, both βI-PKC and βII-PKC were translocated to the membrane in dHL60 cells activated by fMet-Leu-Phe and by PMA. The amount of βI-PKC and βII-PKC recruited to the membrane in response to ligand was reduced in β-PKC-depleted cells. Thus, it is presently not possible to distinguish whether βI-PKC or βII-PKC is essential for activation of O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> generation. Although these studies demonstrated a role for β-PKC in ligand-induced phosphorylation and translocation of p47<sup>phox</sup>, the findings do not preclude role(s) for other kinases in activation of O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> generation, either in phosphorylation of p47<sup>phox</sup>, which has multiple phosphorylation sites, or in other aspects of signaling. Roles for δ-PKC and a phosphatidate-activated kinase have been suggested in activation of the NADPH oxidase (16, 49).

Selective depletion of β-PKC by an antisense strategy demonstrated a selective role for β-PKC in signaling for fMet-Leu-Phe, immune complex, and PMA-induced O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> generation but not for ligand-initiated cell adherence to fibronectin or for azurophil degranulation. Depletion of β-PKC decreased ligand-induced phosphorylation of p47<sup>phox</sup>, translocation of p47<sup>phox</sup> and β-PKC to the membrane, and inhibited O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> generation.
