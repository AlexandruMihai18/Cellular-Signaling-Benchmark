Transforming growth factor β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1 or MAP3K7) is a key signaling component of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways. Activation of TAK1 is tightly regulated through its binding partners and protein modifications. Although TAK1 functions as an essential and positive regulator of innate immune signaling and apoptosis in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), T cells, and other cells, it negatively regulates cell development and activation of proinflammatory signaling pathways in neutrophils. However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for the opposite roles of TAK1 in different cell types remain to be addressed. In this article, we discuss the latest progresses in our understanding of TAK1 regulation, function, and mechanisms in a cell-type specific manner.

**TAK1 signaling**  
TAK1 is a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MAP3K) family and functions as a key signaling molecule in innate immune signaling pathways activated by various stimuli, including cytokines, Toll-like receptor (TLR), B cell receptor (BCR), and T cell receptor (TCR) ligands. After interleukin (IL)-1β or TLR4 ligand (lipopolysaccharide, LPS) stimulation, a sequential signaling cascade is triggered whereby myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88) activates IL-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK)1 and IRAK4, which in turn recruit the RING-domain E3 ubiquitin ligase tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-receptor-associated factor (TRAF)6. TRAF6 and ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme 13 (UBC13)/ubiquitin E2 variant 1a (UEV1A), promote lysine (K) 63-ubiquitination of several target proteins including TRAF6 itself and Inhibitor of κB kinase gamma (IKKγ/NEMO) [1–5]. However, TNF-α stimulation results in recruitment of the RING-domain ubiquitin ligases TRAF2 and TRAF5, followed by receptor-interacting protein 1 (RIP1) ubiquitination. TRAF2/5- or TRAF6-mediated K63 ubiquitination leads to recruitment of TAK1-binding protein (TAB)2 or TAB3. The TAK1 protein kinase complex is composed of its binding partners, TAB1, TAB2, or TAB3, which phosphorylate and activate the IkB kinase (IKK)--NF-κB complex, and MAPK kinases [1–5].

Because global ablation of TAK1 in mice results in embryonic lethality, cell type-specific deletion of TAK1 is widely used to determine the biological functions of TAK1 in different cell types in response to various stimulations and pathogen infections. Although TAK1 has been reported to function as an essential and positive regulator in the proinflammatory signaling cascade in fibroblasts and lymphocytes, our group and others have recently uncovered novel negative regulatory functions for TAK1 in neutrophils in innate immune signaling pathways [6,7]. Furthermore, recent studies show that novel regulatory mechanisms, microbial pathogens or host proteins modulate the activity of TAK1 and its binding partners (TAB1, TAB2, TAB3) through post-translational modifications. In this review, we will summarize recent progress in understanding the cell type-specific functions and regulatory mechanisms of TAK1 in innate immune signaling, inflammatory responses, and cancer development.

**Activation mechanisms and regulation of the TAK1 protein kinase complex**  
TAK1 is one of the most important regulatory components in the NF-κB signaling pathway. Although TAK1 was initially identified as a regulator of MAPK in response to TGF-β and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) [8], further studies have demonstrated that TAK1 can be activated by many stimuli, including IL-1β, TNF-α, TLR ligands, and B and T cell receptor ligands (Figure 1) [1,9–11]. TAK1 forms a heterotrimeric complex with TAB1 and TAB2 or TAB3, which bind to the N and C terminus of TAK1, respectively [12–16]. TAB1 constitutively binds to and activates TAK1 kinase activity, while TAB2 or TAB3 binds to TAK1 after stimulation, by first interacting with activated TRAF6 through polyubiquitin chains, thereby physically anchoring TRAF6 to TAK1 to trigger TAK1 activation (Figure 1). Activation of the TAK1 protein kinase complex is triggered by K63-linked polyubiquitination reactions catalyzed by the E2 ligase UBC13/UEV1A and the RING finger E3 ligases TRAF2 or TRAF6 in response to proinflammatory stimuli (Figure 1). Activated TAK1 then phosphorylates the IKK complex as well as p38, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), thus activating NF-κB and MAP kinase signaling pathways.

**Regulation of TAK1 activation through ubiquitination and phosphorylation**  
K63-linked polyubiquitination at the K158 residue of TAK1 by TRAF6/UBC13/UEV1A has been shown as an important event following stimulation [17–19], although polyubiquitination at K34 and K209 of TAK1 has also been

Figure 1. Transforming growth factor $\beta$-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) activation and downstream signaling pathways. TAK1 activation is triggered by a plethora of stimuli including interleukin-1$\beta$ (IL-1$\beta$), tumor necrosis factor-$\alpha$ (TNF-$\alpha$), B and T cell receptor (BCR and TCR) ligands, and Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and viral ssRNA and DNA. Stimulation of IL-1R and TLRs activates myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88)-dependent pathways and MyD88 recruits TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), IL-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK1), and IRAK4. TRAF6 acts with ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme 13 (Ubc13)/ubiquitin E2 variant 1a (Uev1A) to catalyze lysine (K) 63 polyubiquitination (Ubi) of the TAK1 protein kinase complex. For full activation, TAK1 forms a heterotrimeric complex with TAB1 and TAB2 or TAB3, which strongly interact with K63-linked polyubiquitin chains to drive TAK1 activation by ubiquitination and autophosphorylation (P). The activated TAK1 complex triggers phosphorylation and activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) [p38, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)] and IkB kinase (IKK)-nuclear factor-$\kappa$B (NF-$\kappa$B) pathways. For activation of the IKK-NF-$\kappa$B pathway, IkB undergoes phosphorylation and K48-linked proteasomal degradation to allow nuclear translocation and accumulation of NF-$\kappa$B. TNF-$\alpha$ signals through its cognate receptor, TNFR, leading to TRAF2/5 activation and K63-linked polyubiquitination of receptor-interacting protein 1 (RIP1), which recruits the TAK1 complex to activate downstream MAPK and JNK pathways. Activation of the IKK complex and MAPKs by phosphorylation results in NF-$\kappa$B and activator protein 1 (AP1) activation, followed by transcriptional activation of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, TNF-$\alpha$, and IL-1$\beta$. In T and B cells, TCR and BCR antigenic stimulation facilitates recruitment of the caspase recruitment domain family, member 11 (CARD11/CARMA1)-B cell CLL/lymphoma 10 (BCL10)-mucosa associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation gene 1 (MALT1) protein complex leading to TRAF6-mediated polyubiquitination of the TAK1 complex.

and retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-1) [23,24], indicating that unanchored polyubiquitin chains can also regulate protein kinase activity. Strong interactions between unanchored K63 polyubiquitin chains and TAB2/TAB3 induce conformational changes in TAK1 resulting in its autophosphorylation. K63 polyubiquitin chains on TAK1 protein complexes may serve as a scaffold that facilitates activation of the IKK-NF-$\kappa$B complex (Figure 1).

Recent studies show that Tripartite motif (TRIM) 8 enhances TNF-$\alpha$ and IL-1$\beta$-induced NF-$\kappa$B activation by mediating K63-linked polyubiquitination at K158 of TAK1 [25]. Equally important, several deubiquitinating (DUB) enzymes have been reported that block TAK1 activity, including cylindromatosis (CYLD) and ubiquitin-specific peptidase-4 (USP4) [5,11,26,27] (Figure 2). USP4 has recently been identified as a DUB that deubiquitates TAK1 to block TAK1-mediated NF-$\kappa$B activation [27]. CYLD abrogates TAK1 ubiquitination and autoactivation, leading to hyperactive TAK1, JNK, and IKK signaling in CLYD-deficient T cells [28]. Besides K63-linked ubiquitination-mediated TAK1 activation, recent studies have shown that itchy E3 ubiquitin protein ligase (ITCH) mediates K48-linked polyubiquitination at K72 of TAK1, thus promoting TAK1 degradation [29,30]. Of particular interest is that CYLD and ITCH form a complex that removes K63-linked ubiquitin chains at K158 and then adds K48-linked polyubiquitin chains to TAK1 at K72 [29].

Once TAK1 is polyubiquitinated by TRAF6, it autophosphorylates itself at T187 within its activation loop, as well as other sites, including T184 and S192 [31–34]. To dampen TAK1 and proinflammatory signaling, several protein phosphatases have been identified that inhibit TAK1 phosphorylation. Protein phosphatase 6 (PP6) dephosphorylates T187 to inhibit TAK1 kinase activity [35]. PP2C$\beta$ and PP2$\varepsilon$ are cytokine-responsive phosphatases that regulate TAK1 activity [36,37]. More recently, dual specificity phosphatase (DUSP14) was reported to negatively regulate TNF- and IL-1-induced NF-$\kappa$B activation by dephosphorylating TAK1 at T187 [38]. A negative feedback loop involving phosphorylation of TAB1 at S423 and T431 by p38 MAPK also blocks TAK1 activation [39].

Regulation of TAK1 activation through its binding partners TAB1, and TAB2, or TAB3

TAB1 is an adaptor protein without enzymatic activity (i.e., a pseudophosphatase), but is constitutively bound to TAK1 even in resting cells (Figures 1 and 2). Although early studies show that TAK1 activity requires TAB1 co-expression, TAB1-deficient MEFs show normal response to TNF-$\alpha$, IL-1$\beta$, and TGF-$\beta$ stimulation. While TAB1 binds to TAK1 with high affinity, TAB1 can also directly bind to p38$\alpha$, resulting in enhanced phosphorylation and activation of p38$\alpha$ [40]. Recently, O-GlcNAcylation of TAB1 on S395 was shown to be essential for activation of TAK1 [41]. By contrast, TAB2 and TAB3 are not bound to TAK1 in resting cells, but they bind to TAK1 after stimulation with TNF-$\alpha$ or IL-1$\beta$ [12,14]. Because both TAB2 and TAB3 contain a C-terminal NZF ubiquitin-binding domain, they can bind to K63-linked polyubiquitin chains on TRAF6 or RIP1, thus promoting TAK1 activation as well as IKK phosphorylation. In addition, the coiled-coil (CC) domain

reported in response to TNF-$\alpha$, IL-1$\beta$, and TGF-$\beta$ stimulation [20,21]. TAB2 and TAB3 preferentially bind to K63-linked polyubiquitin chains with strong affinity through a highly conserved Np14 zinc finger (NZF) domain to activate TAK1 [22]. In the TNF signaling pathway, TAB2 binds to polyubiquitinated RIP1 following TNF-$\alpha$ stimulation, further demonstrating that polyubiquitination is crucial for TAK1 activation [22]. Recent studies show that free, unconjugated, K63-linked polyubiquitin chains can activate TAK1

Figure 2. Activation and regulation of transforming growth factor β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) along with binding partners TAB1, TAB2, and TAB3. Site-specific post-translational modifications and domains of each protein are denoted. TAK1 is targeted for lysine (K) 63-linked polyubiquitination at K158 by tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) and Tripartite motif 8 (TRIM8), and K48-linked polyubiquitination at K72 by itchy E3 ubiquitin protein ligase (ITCH). Deubiquitinating (DUB) enzymes such as ubiquitin-specific peptidase-4 (USP4) and cylindromatosis (CYLD) counteract TAK1 activity and block nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and/or mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling. K63-linked ubiquitin chains bind TAB2 and TAB3 in their highly conserved Np14 zinc finger (NZF) domain to activate TAK1. Autophosphorylation of TAK1 within its activation loop is crucial for its protein kinase activity, and phosphatases such as protein phosphatase 6 (PP6) and dual specificity phosphatase 14 (DUSP14) catalyze TAK1 dephosphorylation in the critical Thr187 site. TAB2 and TAB3 are phosphorylated at multiple sites through p38 MAPK-dependent and -independent mechanisms. O-GlcNAcylation (O-GlcNAc) of TAB1 on Ser395 is important for TAK1 activation. Importantly, several microbial proteins such as TRIM5, CagA, YopJ, and YopP regulate TAK1 activation through diverse mechanisms. TRIM5, together with ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme 13 (UBC13)/ubiquitin E2 variant 1a (UEV1A), catalyze the synthesis of unattached K63-linked ubiquitin chains for activating TAK1. NleE blocks host NF-κB signaling by cysteine-methylation of TAB2 and TAB3 NZF domains.

found in the C terminus of TAB2 and TAB3 is crucial for their protein-protein interactions with TAK1 [12,14].

Regulation of TAK1-TAB1-TAB2 complex by viral and bacterial infection

TRIM5α is a RING domain-E3 ubiquitin ligase that restricts infection of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 and other retroviruses [42]. Recent studies show that together with ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Ubc13/Uev1A, TRIM5 catalyzes the synthesis of unattached K63-linked polyubiquitin chains to promote TAK1 activation (Figure 2) [43,44]. The YopJ protein of *Yersinia pseudotuberculosis* has been proposed to inhibit the NF-κB pathway by targeting TAK1 [45,46], but how YopJ inhibits TAK1 is unclear. Recent studies showed that YopJ acetylates TAK1 on several threonine residues—T184 and T187—of mammalian TAK1, or at residues T168 and T171 (and possibly S167 and S176) of *Drosophila* TAK1, which are key phosphorylation sites within the activation loop of TAK1 [47,48], suggesting that acetylation of TAK1 by YopJ is a conserved mechanism by which YopJ inhibits NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways in mammals and *Drosophila*. By contrast, CagA protein of *Helicobacter pylori* physically interacts with TAK1 and enhances its activity and TAK1-induced NF-κB activation through TRAF6-mediated K63-linked ubiquitination of TAK1 [49]. The virulence factor YopP of *Yersinia enterocolitica* inhibits NF-κB signaling in host cells by interacting with TAB1, thus disrupting the TAK1-TAB1 complex and TAK1 activation [50]. Recent studies show that the type III secretion system (T3SS) effector proteins, NleE and NleB from enteropathogenic *Escherichia coli* and OspZ from *Shigella* inhibit NF-κB signaling in host cells [51,52]. In particular, NleE inhibits both TNF-α- and IL-1β-stimulated p65 nuclear translocation and IκB degradation, whereas NleB inhibits the TNF-α pathway only [51]. Recent mechanistic studies demonstrate that NleE inhibits NF-κB signaling by cysteine methylation of the NZF domain of TAB2 and TAB3 [53]. NleE contains an S-adenosyl-l-methionine-dependent methyltransferase activity that targets a zinc-coordinating cysteine in the NZF domains in TAB2 and TAB3 for modification, thus inactivating the zinc ion as well as the ubiquitin-chain binding ability [53]. These studies suggest that TAK1 activation is regulated by pathogens through multiple mechanisms involving modifications of TAK1, TAB1, TAB2, and TAB3 (Figure 2).

Functional studies of TAK1, TAB1, and TAB2 in knockout mice

Global deletion of TAK1, TAB1, or TAB2 in mice results in embryonic lethality, underscoring the importance of these genes for normal mammalian development [4,54–57]. While TAK1 knockout mice display abnormal neural fold dysmorphogenesis and vascular development, TAB1 knockout mice develop cardiac defects and underdeveloped

lung alveoli [54, 58]. However, TNF-α and IL-1β-mediated activation of TAK1 is completely normal in TAB1-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), although osmotic stress-induced activation of TAK1 was largely impaired in TAB1-deficient MEFs [4, 59]. Similarly, TAB2 knockout mice died of liver apoptosis before embryonic day E12.5, but TAB2-deficient MEFs showed normal IKK and JNK activation in response to IL-1β or TNF-α stimulation [55]. These results suggest that TAK1, TAB1, and TAB2 may play different roles in innate immune signaling, depending on cell or tissue types. Recent studies further show that specific deletion of TAB1 or TAB2 in skin epidermis or intestinal epithelium did not result in any abnormalities [60]. However, epithelium-specific deletion of both TAB1 and TAB2 in mice showed similar phenotypes to epithelium-specific deletion of TAK1 mice. TNFR deletion rescues the abnormalities in the TAB1 and TAB2 double knockout mice, as it does in TAK1 knockout mice. TAB1, but not TAB2, is critical for phosphorylation-dependent TAK1 activation under conditions that block the phosphatase activity of PP2A on TAK1, suggesting that TAB1 is mainly involved in sustaining the basal activity of TAK1, whereas TAB2 is involved in stimulation-dependent activation of TAK1 [46]. The specific role of TAK1 in regulation of signaling networks linked to the innate and adaptive immune system has been explored in detail using tissue-specific knockout mouse models, as discussed below.

Cell type-specific functions of TAK1

Essential and positive function of TAK1 in fibroblasts

Because global deletion of TAK1 is embryonic lethal, emerging evidence suggests that TAK1 regulates NF-κB and MAPK activation in a cell type-specific and receptor-specific manner. Using TAK1-deficient MEFs, it has been demonstrated that NF-κB and MAPK activation were completely impaired after stimulation with IL-1 or LPS [4, 6], suggesting that TAK1 is required for the activation of NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways (Figure 3).

Differential effects of TAK1 deletion on B and T cells

After BCR stimulation, the caspase recruitment domain family, member 11 (CARD11/CARMA1) - B cell CLL/lymphoma 10 (BCL10) - mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation gene 1 (MALT1) complex that is crucial for BCR-induced NF-κB and JNK activation interacts with TRAF6, which in turn activates TAK1 [56]. It has been shown that TAK1 is indispensable for NF-κB and MAPK signaling in response to cytokines and TLR ligands and BCR-induced JNK activation, however, later studies revealed that TAK1 is required for BCR-induced activation of both NF-κB and JNK [56, 61]. Furthermore, in earlier studies, B-1 cell development was impaired in B cell-specific TAK1-deficient mice, but later reports showed that TAK1 is indispensable for development of both follicular (FO) and marginal zone (MZ) B cells. In T lymphocytes, three independent studies revealed that TAK1 is indispensable for survival and maintenance of peripheral T cells and also for TCR-mediated NF-κB and MAPK activation [62–64]. Ablation of TAK1 in mature thymocytes abrogates TCR-mediated activation of NF-κB and JNK, and sensitizes cells to apoptosis. However, TAK1 is dispensable for NF-κB and JNK signaling in effector T cells, but is important for proliferation and p38 activation [64].

Besides lymphocytes, TAK1 ablation has profound effects on other immune cell subtypes. Conditional deletion of TAK1 in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs)

TAK1 is essential for nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). In neutrophils, TAK1 acts as a negative regulator of proinflammatory signaling pathways. In other cell types such as macrophages, B cells, and T cells, TAK1 deletion has differential effects on NF-κB, p38, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling and cytokine production, although these cells share a common feature—cell apoptosis.**

shows that the kinase is critical for survival of HSPCs and hepatocytes [65]. Massive cell autonomous apoptosis was observed in the bone marrow, spleen, thymus, and liver (hepatocytes), which culminated in bone marrow (BM) and liver failure. TAK1 deficiency also abrogates downstream NF-κB and JNK signaling in BM. The CARMA1-BCL10-MALT1 signaling complex recruits TAK1 as a downstream signaling molecule, resulting in natural killer (NK) cell-mediated cytotoxicity and cytokine/chemokine production. Consequently, TAK1 inactivation in NK cells impairs NKG2D-mediated NK cell cytotoxicity, cytokine/chemokine production, and NF-κB and activator protein 1 (AP1) activity [66]. TAK1 deficiency in CD11c+ dendritic cells (DCs) triggers apoptosis and depletion of CD8+ and CD103+ DC subsets in lymphoid and nonlymphoid tissues, respectively [67]. Moreover, TAK1 is an important signaling intermediate in TLR ligand-induced activation of NF-κB in DCs.

**TAK1 function in non-immune cells**

As mentioned above, TAK1 deletion in MEFs leads to complete loss of NF-κB, p38, JNK, and ERK signaling in response to various cytokines and TLR ligand stimulation. To gain insight on the function of TAK1 on skin development, epidermal-specific TAK1 deficient mice were generated [68]. Loss of TAK1 in the skin results in severe skin inflammation and massive keratinocyte death and mice died by 7–8 days post-birth. TAK1 deficiency enhanced TNF-α-induced apoptosis in keratinocytes due to decreased activation of prosurvival signals IKK and JNK. These findings indicate that the TAK1-IKK-NF-κB pathway is a major regulator of skin-epidermis integrity and it is crucial for circumventing TNF-α-induced cell death in the skin. The function of TAK1 in maintenance of intestinal epithelium homeostasis was probed by generating enterocyte-specific TAK1 deficient mice [69]. Loss of TAK1 causes spontaneous intestinal inflammation and apoptosis, resulting in mice death by postnatal day 1. TNF-α-induced apoptosis was markedly enhanced and coincided with intestinal inflammation and increased secretion of proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines in TAK1-deficient mice. Ablation of TNF receptor 1 (Tnfr1) expression in TAK1-deficient mice attenuated apoptosis and intestinal inflammation, but mice still developed TNF-α-independent ileitis and colitis, suggesting that other TNF family ligands may also promote apoptosis, which triggers intestinal damage. Therefore, TAK1 is essential for regulating epithelial integrity by controlling innate immunity in enterocytes and by modulating TNF-α-induced apoptosis and tissue damage.

Two independent studies have addressed the function of TAK1 in liver development and proinflammatory signaling in hepatocytes. In young (1-month-old) hepatocyte-specific TAK1-deficient mice, spontaneous hepatocyte apoptosis, compensatory hepatocyte proliferation, hepatic inflammation, and perisinusoidal fibrosis developed, while older mice spontaneously developed multiple large liver tumors starting at 4 months old, marked by increased expression of α-fetoprotein, a protumorigenic fetal liver gene [70]. TNF-α-induced NF-κB and JNK activation was reduced and spontaneous hepatocyte apoptosis was enhanced in

TAK1-deficient cells. Moreover, TNFR signaling was critical for regulation of inflammation, cell death, and fibrosis in TAK1-deficient hepatocytes. The specific deletion of TAK1 in liver parenchymal cells (hepatocytes and cholangiocytes) induced hepatocyte dysplasia and early-onset hepatocarcinogenesis, correlating with biliary ductopenia, cholestasis, and liver fibrosis, and older mice eventually succumbed to death [71]. Hepatic apoptosis and proliferation occurred concomitantly, leading to development of hepatocellular carcinoma. In addition, TAK1 was essential for LPS- and TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation, and NEMO (IKKγ), the regulatory IKK subunit, was identified as a master regulator of TAK1 in hepatocytes [71].

Abolishing TAK1 expression in the cartilage results in abnormal cartilage development, growth retardation, and death within 2–3 weeks after birth [72]. Furthermore, TAK1-deficient mice developed severe chondrodysplasia with runting, impaired formation of secondary centers of ossification, elbow dislocation, and tarsal fusion. Bone morphogenic protein receptor (BMPR) signaling was markedly impaired in TAK1-deficient chondrocytes, resulting in diminished activation of p38, JNK, and ERK MAPKs. Endothelial-specific TAK1- and TAB2-deficient mice exhibit embryonic lethality, and both genes are important for vascular formation and endothelial cell migration [73]. Therefore, TAK1 is essential for homeostasis in immune and non-immune tissues in the steady state and it acts as a positive modulator of NF-κB and MAPK pathways. These functions are exerted through diverse means including regulation of apoptosis, inflammation, proliferation, and tumorigenesis.

**TAK1 functions as a negative regulator in neutrophils**

Contrary to its predominant prosurvival function in most immune cells, we recently identified a novel, negative regulatory function of TAK1 in myeloid (neutrophils and macrophages) cell development and innate immune signaling [6] (Figure 3). Our studies demonstrated that myeloid-specific TAK1 ablation leads to neutrophilia and myeloproliferative disorder (splenomegaly and lymphomegaly). In addition, LPS stimulation of TAK1-deficient neutrophils enhanced IKK, p38, and JNK phosphorylation, leading to robust production of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-1β and TNF-α) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in TAK1-deficient neutrophils [6]. These findings are supported by an independent study showing that myeloid TAK1 negatively controls proinflammatory signaling in neutrophils [74]. Similarly, another recent study shows that myeloid-specific TAK1 deletion results in splenomegaly and enhanced neutrophil and monocyte infiltration into peripheral tissues [7]. However, IKK, p38, JNK, and ERK signaling and cytokines in TAK1-deficient macrophages were reduced or little changed, compared with wild type controls [6,7], suggesting that TAK1 signaling in macrophages is different from neutrophils. Consistent with this notion, macrophages undergo apoptosis during in vitro culture [6,7]. Contrary to our findings in mouse neutrophils, TAK1 acts as a positive regulator of TNF-α- and LPS-induced IKK and p38MAPK phosphorylation in human neutrophils [75]. However, inhibition of TAK1 in human neutrophils with an inhibitor (5z-7-oxozeaenol)

might be different from the specific knockout of TAK1 in
neutrophils. Interestingly, previous studies show that in-
activation of IRAK4 did not affect the level of NF-κB
activation, but reduced TLR ligand-mediated mRNA sta-
bility, resulting in decreased amounts of cytokine produc-
tion in macrophages [76]. Thus, the IRAK4 kinase-inactive
knock-in mice were resistant to LPS-induced septic shock
[76], which is opposite to the phenotype and LPS response
observed in myeloid-specific TAK1-deficient mice [6].

Molecular mechanisms of negative regulation of TAK1
in neutrophils
Although TAB1 constitutively binds to TAK1 with high
affinity even in resting cells, it can also directly bind to p38,
resulting in enhanced autophosphorylation of p38 [40]. p38
was deleted in myeloid cells to determine whether in-
creased p38 activation in TAK1-deficient neutrophils con-
trols observed phenotypes. We show that myeloid-specific
deletion of p38 in TAK1-deficient mice restores the phe-
notypes (splenomegaly and lymphadenopathy), hyperpro-
liferation, increased NF-κB, p38, and JNK signaling and
proinflammatory cytokine production [6]. Thus, it appears
that increased activation of p38 in TAK1-deficient neu-
trophils may be responsible for the increased production of IL-
1β, IL-6, and TNF-α. Consistent with these results, the
hypersensitivity to LPS-induced septic shock in TAK1 and
p38-double knockout mice is reduced, compared with
TAK1 single mutant mice [6]. Thus, although TAK1 dele-
tion affects the phosphorylation of IKK, p38, and JNK in
neutrophils, its effect on p38 appears to be critical for the
observed phenotypes and cytokine production in myeloid-
specific TAK1-deficient mice (Figure 3).
A key question is how TAK1 deletion in neutrophils
increases the phosphorylation of p38. It appears that the
TAB1–p38 interaction is an important factor in increased
p38 activation in TAK1-deficient neutrophils. We show
that TAB1–p38 interaction is much higher in TAK1-defi-
cient neutrophils than in TAK1-deficient MEFs or macro-
phages before and after LPS stimulation [6]. However,
TAB1 cannot stimulate IKK phosphorylation. Because
mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 3
(MAPKKK3/MEKK3) can also activate IKK and p38 phos-
phorylation, we generated TAK1 and MEKK3 double
knockout mice. Specific deletion of MEKK3 in myeloid cells
partially reduced the splenomegaly observed in TAK1-
deficient mice, but neither increased LPS-induced IKK
and p38 phosphorylation nor increased sensitivity to
LPS-induced septic shock was changed in TAK1 and
MEKK3 double knockout mice, indicating that MEKK3
might not be primarily responsible for increased IKK
and p38 phosphorylation in TAK1-deficient neutrophils
[6]. Although TAK1-independent and MEKK3-dependent
NF-κB activation has been reported in 293 cells [77], it is
not clear how NF-κB is activated in neutrophils. Several
recent studies show that LPS-induced ROS can promote
IKK and p38 phosphorylation through mitogen-activated
protein kinase kinase 5 (MAPKKK5/ASK1) (a
MAP3K family member), but not MEKK3 [78–81]. Indeed,
treatment of neutrophils with NAC (ROS inhibitor)
completely inhibited ROS production and abolished IKK
and p38 phosphorylation. Recently, TAK1–TAB2 was

shown to competitively and reciprocally regulate TAK1–
ASK1 interactions, to drive TAK1-mediated NF-κB and
AP-1 activation, while impairing ASK1-induced AP-1 acti-
vation [82]. Based on these studies, we propose a working
model as shown in Figure 3. LPS treatment induces LPS-
specific ROS in both wild type and TAK1-deficient neu-
trophils, which activates IKK and p38 phosphorylation. How-
ever, in TAK1-deficient neutrophils, free TAB1 in TAK1-
deficient neutrophils enhances or amplifies p38 phospho-
ylation. By contrast, TAB1 in wild type cells constitutively
binds to TAK1, which has the ability to inhibit ASK1-
induced ROS production. Increased activation of p38 as
well as IKK in TAK1-deficient neutrophils leads to in-
creased production of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1β,
IL-6, and TNF-α), which further increases ROS production
through cytokine receptor signaling pathways. Because
ROS is a potent stimulator of inflammasome activation
[83], increased production of ROS in TAK1-deficient neu-
trophils may enhance inflammasome activation, which
might explain high amounts of IL-1β production.

Role of TAK1 in TNF-α-mediated apoptosis and ROS
production in other cells
One common feature of TAK1 deletion in different types of
cells with the exception of neutrophils is that TAK1 defi-
ciency promotes cell apoptosis. Anti-apoptosis signals from
the NF-κB pathway protect cells from TNF-α-induced apo-
ptosis [84,85]. Consequently, impaired NF-κB and JNK
activation in TAK1-deficient MEFs, is marked by increased
sensitivity to TNF-α-induced apoptosis [4,56]. In TAK1-
deficient skin keratinocytes, TNF-α-induced NF-κB and
JNK activation is defective, thus cells are highly sensitive
to TNF-α-induced apoptosis [68]. Deletion of Tnfr1 rescued
TAK1-deficient mice from spontaneous keratinocyte death
and inflammation. Similarly, deletion of TAK1 in hepato-
cytes or liver parenchymal cells results in massive sponta-
neous hepatocyte cell death, which is further enhanced by
TNF-α stimulation [70,71]. In the absence of stimuli, JNK is
spontaneously activated in the liver of TAK1-deficient mice,
and ablation of Tnfr1 in TAK1-deficient mice rescued TAK1-
deficient hepatocytes from death [86]. TAK1 deficiency in
HSPCs provokes bone marrow and liver failure [65], and
genetic studies linked various death signals including TNF-
α/Fas–RIP-1-dependent necroptosis and caspase-8-depen-
dent extrinsic apoptotic signaling to HSPC death [87]. Re-
cent studies show that myeloid-specific deletion of TAK1
causes spontaneous death of cultured bone marrow-derived
macrophages [6,7], but macrophage death could not be
rescued by specific deletion of Tnfr1 [7]. Instead, myeloid
TAK1 is a crucial regulator of monocyte survival by inhib-
ing caspase- and RIP3-mediated apoptosis and necroptosis,
respectively [7]. TAK1 signaling is also crucial for prosurvi-
val signaling in DCs, as TAK1 deficiency in CD11c+ DCs
promotes apoptosis marked by increased caspase activity
and TUNEL staining [67]. TAK1 is also a crucial modulator
of angiogenesis, as endothelial cell-specific TAK1 and TAB2
deletion was marked by TNF-dependent endothelial cell
death and vessel regression [73].
Proinflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α, IL-1β,
IFN-α/γ, as well as FasL drive programmed cell death in
HSPCs by inducing production of ROS [88,89]. TAK1 is a

known regulator of the redox system and dysregulation of
this system results in oxidative stress and inflammation.
Specific deletion of TAK1 in the intestinal epithelium-and
skin epidermis results in accumulation of ROS, which
promotes epithelial cell death and inflammation [90, 91].
Similar to TAK1-deficient keratinocytes, deletion of both
TAB1 and TAB2 results in ROS accumulation, epithelial
cell death, and inflammation [60]. These findings suggest
that TAK1-mediated prosurvival signaling is essential for
protecting cells from apoptosis induced by inflammatory
cytokines, ROS, and other cell stress stimuli.

Role of TAK1 in inflammatory diseases and
tumorigenesis
Proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α
have been shown to promote cancer development and
progression [92]. Thus, it is important to continue exploring
the physiological relevance of the cell type-specific
regulatory functions of TAK1 in inflammatory diseases
such as cancer and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
TAK1 ablation generally triggers severe apoptosis and
inflammation, and in some cases tumorigenesis. Sato
et al. observed that TAK1 deletion in T cells impaired
peripheral T cell development, including thymic regulatory
T (Treg) cells, resulting in spontaneous development of
colitis in mice [63]. Similarly, TAK1-deficiency in skin [68]
and intestinal epithelia [69] provokes increased proinflammatory
cytokine/chemokine release and severe inflammatory
phenotypes in target tissues. Recently, TAK1 was
found to be important for TNF-independent regulation of
intestinal integrity, cytoprotection, and intestinal epithelium
repair in an acute colitis model [93]. Conditional
inactivation of TAK1 in the liver indicated that it acts
as a tumor suppressor, and loss of TAK1 expression results
in inflammation and hepatocarcinogenesis in TAK1-deficient
hepatocytes, indicating that TAK1 is crucial for liver homeostasis and tumor suppression [70, 71]. Studies of other
immune regulators have shed more light on the role of
TAK1 in development of inflammation-linked cancer. Genetic
ablation of ITCH or CYLD results in sustained TAK1
activation, increased production of tumor-promoting proinflammatory
cytokines, chronic inflammation, and aggressive
lung tumor growth and metastasis [29].

By contrast, inhibition of TAK1 also produces antitumor
effects. TAK1 deficiency in skin keratinocytes is marked by
increased oxidative stress, which results in accumulation of
ROS in the skin and regression of chemically-induced skin
tumors, suggesting that TAK1 blockade can be developed as
a new and effective molecular target for ROS-based tumor
killing [94]. TAK1 regulates AMP-activated protein kinase
(AMPK/Snf1) and polarization-related protein (LKB1), indicating it has key functions in multiple signaling pathways
controlling metabolism and tumor suppression, respectively
[95–97]. Pharmacologic inhibition of TAK1 shows that it is
an important kinase in APC and KRAS mutant colon cancers through its modulation of Wnt signaling [98].
Activation of the TGF-β signaling pathway either suppresses or promotes tumor initiation and progression in a
context-dependent manner. The TRAF6/TAK1 pro-apoptotic
signaling cascade promotes death of prostate cancer

cells [20], suggesting that this pathway can be exploited for
cancer therapeutics. Moreover, the chromosome 6q14-21
region encoding MAP3K7 and four other genes is frequently
deleted in human prostate cancer specimens [99]. In
subsequent studies, TAK1 expression is diminished with
increasing Gleason scores in human prostate cancer tissues, further highlighting the tumor suppressor function of
TAK1 in prostate cancer [100]. Detailed mechanistic studies in mouse prostate cancer stem cells and TAK1-deficient
prostate epithelial cells revealed that TAK1 loss promotes
cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, and diminished
pro-apoptotic p38/JNK MAPK signaling. By contrast, Ray
et al. found that fatty acid-induced TAK1 activation promotes breast cancer cell adhesion and invasion and enhanced lung metastasis *in vivo* [101], underscoring the
importance of the tumor microenvironment on TAK1 functions during tumor progression and metastasis. Recent
studies have also implicated TAK1 in development of
lymphoid malignancies. Activated TAK1 is abundantly
expressed in multiple lymphoma cell lines and abrogation
of TAK1 results in reduced NF-κB and p38 activation and
increased apoptosis, indicating that TAK1 is a prosurvival
factor in lymphoma [102]. Lamothe and colleagues recently
showed that myeloid TAK1-deficiency causes fatal, myelomonocytic leukemia in older animals [7], suggesting that
the oncogenic or tumor suppressor function of TAK1 in
tumor progression and metastasis is context and cell type-
dependent. Our current understanding of the role and
molecular mechanisms of TAK1 in innate immune signaling must be improved for the prevention and treatments of
inflammation-induced cancer [103].

Concluding remarks and future directions
Since the discovery of TAK1 over two decades ago, significant progress has been made toward elucidating the cell
type-specific functions of this protein kinase in immune and
non-immune cells. TAK1 is a central component of innate
immune signaling activated by many different stimuli,
including TLRs, cytokines, and even pathogen infection.
Ubiquitination and phosphorylation of TAK1 and its associated partners (TAB1, TAB2, and TAB3) are key events for
activating downstream NF-κB, p38, JNK, and ERK signaling pathways. Because of the embryonic lethality of TAK1
deletion, the specific function of TAK1 has been studied
using cell- or tissue-specific TAK1 knockout mice. It appears
that MEFs serve as an example that TAK1 functions as an
essential positive regulator of innate immune signaling,
which fits well with classic NF-κB and MAPK signaling
pathways. However, TAK1 plays differential regulatory
roles in B cells, DCs, macrophages, T cells, and non-immune
cells. TAK1 deficiency leads to increased cell apoptosis in
these cell types, but differentially affects NF-κB and MAPK
signaling pathways, as well as cytokine production. Unexpectedly, TAK1 functions as a negative regulator in neutrophils. TAK1 deficiency in neutrophils increases cell
proliferation and survival, and enhances NF-κB, p38, and
JNK signaling, whereas ERK signaling is not affected.
Consistent with these, IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α as well as
ROS production in TAK1-deficient neutrophils are also
markedly increased. Therefore, neutrophils may be useful
in dissecting the molecular mechanisms by which TAK1

negatively regulates NF-κB, p38, and JNK signaling pathways, and production of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α) and ROS. Neutrophils are key players in the communication networks that form the foundations of immunity [104]. Being one of the first cells to arrive at sites of infection, neutrophils interact with a host of other cell types in the innate and adaptive immune system. For example, T helper 17 (Th17) cells secrete IL-17, a key cytokine that controls neutrophil dynamics, by upregulating expression of IL-8, G-CSF, and TNF-α in different cell types [105]. Furthermore, neutrophils can be protumorigenic, induce tumor cytotoxicity [106], and inhibit distant metastasis [107]. Therefore, extensive studies are needed to better understand the role of TAK1 signaling in neutrophils, inflammation, and inflammation-linked disorders such as cancer and IBD. In particular, further studies are needed to determine the precise mechanisms by which TAK1 negatively regulates innate immune signaling pathways in neutrophils. Because TAK1 deletion shows differential effects on NF-κB, p38, JNK, and ERK activation, further studies are needed to dissect the role and molecular mechanisms of TAK1 in different types of immune cells, in cancer, and in infectious diseases.
