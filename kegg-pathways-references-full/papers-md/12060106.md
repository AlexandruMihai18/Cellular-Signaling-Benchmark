## SUMMARY

1. An increase in transmural pressure in arterioles results in a shortening of vascular smooth muscle cells, with subsequent constriction of the vessel. The mechanisms underlying this myogenic contraction are not fully understood; however, the obligatory role of increases in intracellular [Ca²⁺] and myosin light chain phosphorylation have been demonstrated.

2. The myogenic response shows a relationship with smooth muscle cell membrane potential and influx of extracellular Ca²⁺ through voltage-operated Ca²⁺ channels (VOCC). Mechanically sensitive channels and possibly release of Ca²⁺ from intracellular stores may play a role. However, there are other components of myogenic contraction that cannot be explained by a Ca²⁺-MLCK mechanism, for example the initial sensing of alterations in transmural pressure, whether sustained myogenic constriction involves myofilament Ca²⁺ sensitization or remodelling of the vessel wall in response to a maintained increase in transmural pressure.

3. In an attempt to investigate these areas, recent studies have examined a role for tyrosine phosphorylation pathways in pressure-induced contraction of arterioles. In rat pressurized cremaster arterioles, tyrosine kinase inhibitors dilated vessels showing spontaneous myogenic tone and tyrosine phosphatase inhibitors caused vasoconstriction. However, pressure-induced myogenic constriction of vessels persisted in the presence of these agents. Biochemical studies revealed that phosphotyrosine formed at a relatively slow rate (significant after 5 min, with maximal increase after approximately 15 min) in response to increased vessel transmural pressure, in contrast with myosin light chain phosphorylation or the time-course of myogenic constriction itself (maximum within 1 min).

4. Taken together, these observations support the idea of a role for tyrosine phosphorylation pathways in longer-term responses to increased transmural pressure rather than acute

myogenic constriction. Phosphotyrosine formation was also more closely correlated to vessel wall tension (pressure × diameter) than the diameter of the arterioles alone. The identity of the tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins requires further investigation; however, there is some evidence supporting roles for cSrc-type tyrosine kinases and p44 mitogen-activated protein kinase. The longer-term responses of blood vessels to increased transmural pressure that may involve tyrosine phosphorylation pathways include maintenance of myogenic constriction and vessel wall remodelling.

Key words: arterioles, Ca²⁺ signalling, myogenic response, myosin light chain kinase, tyrosine phosphorylation, vascular smooth muscle.

## MYOGENIC RESPONSES

Myogenic responsiveness of arterioles refers to the adjustments to vasomotor tone following alterations in transmural pressure. *In vivo*, such alterations are caused by changes in intraluminal blood pressure, with vessels constricting in response to an increase in pressure or dilating in response to a reduction in pressure. In practice, the normal resting blood pressure results in a maintained or spontaneous level of myogenic constriction, termed myogenic tone. Studies have shown myogenic activity is an inherent property of vascular smooth muscle, with little evidence for a direct role for factors derived from the endothelium, vessel nerve supply or paracrine or endocrine substances, although such signals interact with myogenic tone (for reviews see Osol,¹ Davis and Hill,² Schubert and Mulvany³ and Davis *et al.*⁴).

The intracellular signalling mechanisms involved in myogenic responses are not fully understood. The present review will focus on the evidence supporting the important role of the Ca²⁺-calmodulin-myosin light chain kinase pathway in myogenic contraction of vascular smooth muscle and our recent studies on the possible role of tyrosine phosphorylation pathways.

accompanied by an increase in cytosolic [Ca²⁺] and removal of extracellular Ca²⁺ completely abolishes myogenic activity, suggesting Ca²⁺ entry into cells from the extracellular space is a major factor in myogenic constriction. A number of studies¹⁰⁻¹⁴ have noted a strong correlation between vessel transmural pressure and smooth muscle cell membrane potential, raising the possibility that Ca²⁺ enters the cells through voltage-dependent mechanisms. Consistent with a role for pressure-induced depolarization, blockers of L-type voltage-operated Ca²⁺ channels (VOCC), including nifedipine, verapamil and nicardipine, have been shown to greatly reduce myogenic responses.¹²,¹⁴,¹⁵ The role of other VOCC has not been thoroughly investigated. In the rat cremaster arteriole, the T-channel blocker mibefradil produced a vasodilatory and [Ca²⁺]-lowering effect at concentrations consistent with blockade of L-type Ca²⁺ channels;¹⁴ however, a study in small arterioles demonstrated a dilating effect of mibefradil when L-type Ca²⁺ channel antagonists were ineffective, suggesting a role for T-channels in this model.¹⁶ Although inhibition of the L-type VOCC abolished myogenic responses in rat cremaster arteriole, the pressure-induced depolarization was not blocked by nifedipine, suggesting no role for VOCC in initiating the depolarization.¹³

The contribution of other Ca²⁺ sources to myogenic contraction is yet to be established firmly.⁹ In addition to VOCC, arteriolar smooth muscle cells possess ion channels sensitive to cell membrane stretch¹⁷⁻²⁰ that may be activated by vessel distension arising from an increase in intraluminal pressure. However, these channels have

relative permeability for K⁺ and Na⁺ compared with Ca²⁺ and are thought to contribute to the membrane depolarization following cell stretch rather than Ca²⁺ influx.²¹ The importance of cell stretch alone as a stimulus is uncertain. In the rat cremaster arteriole, either a 'slow' or 'instantaneous' increase in transmural pressure from 50 to 120 mmHg resulted in similar increases intracellular [Ca²⁺] and reduction in vessel diameter, despite the lack of overt cell stretch in the former model.²² Furthermore, an acute longitudinal (as opposed to radial) stretch of arterioles caused a rapid, transient increase in intracellular smooth muscle [Ca²⁺] similar to that observed in the initial stages of pressure-induced cell stretch; however, longitudinal stretch did not cause vessel constriction.²² These observations suggest that simple 'stretching' of smooth muscle cells alone is not an obligatory factor in myogenic activity.

Vascular smooth muscle cells also possess intracellular stores of Ca²⁺; however, the role of intracellular Ca²⁺ release in myogenic constriction of blood vessels is largely unknown. Intracellular Ca²⁺ stores may be released by activation of phospholipase (PL) C and generation of the second messenger inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP₃). A study in rat renal arteries²³ and conduit arteries²⁴ showed increased PLC activation and generation of IP₃ in response to increased wall tension; however, there is no compelling evidence supporting a role for pressure-induced intracellular Ca²⁺ release in myogenic contraction. Such studies are complicated by the fact that removal of extracellular Ca²⁺ abolishes myogenic tone. Indirect evidence supporting a role for intracellular Ca²⁺ release comes

Fig. 1 Mechanisms of myogenic constriction of vascular smooth muscle for which there is strong evidence. An increase in stretch or wall tension of the vessel wall causes depolarization of the smooth muscle cell membrane and opening of voltage-operated Ca²⁺ channels (VOCC). The increase in intracellular Ca²⁺ activates the calmodulin (CaM)-dependent enzyme myosin light chain kinase (MLCK), which then phosphorylates (P) the 20 kDa light chain of myosin, initiating myofilament cross-bridge cycling and cell contraction. The mechanism of depolarization is not known. Some evidence exists to suggest integrins, activated by binding elements of the extracellular matrix (ECM), may stimulate VOCC.

from the observation that depletion of intracellular Ca²⁺ stores using ryanodine slowed the rate of pressure-induced myogenic contraction.²⁵ Recently, it has been suggested that ryanodine receptors are involved in initiating dilation of pressurized vessels through generation of Ca²⁺ ‘sparks’.²⁶

An increase in intracellular [Ca²⁺] brings about smooth muscle cell contraction through calmodulin binding and activation of myosin light chain kinase (MLCK), with subsequent phosphorylation of the 20 kDa light chain of myosin (LC₂₀). Evidence supports such a pathway in myogenic constriction of the rat cremaster arteriole, where pressure-dependent increases in phosphorylation of LC₂₀ were demonstrated using gel electrophoresis.⁷,⁸ The time-course of LC₂₀ phosphorylation was rapid, occurring within 10 s of the pressure increase and was sustained for at least 5 min following the pressure step. Further, the MLCK inhibitors ML-7 and ML-9 inhibited myogenic contraction.⁷,⁸

In summary, evidence supports a role for the ‘classical’ pathway of smooth muscle contraction in pressure-induced myogenic contraction of vascular smooth muscle (Fig. 1). However, the signalling pathways involved in other aspects of myogenic activity require further examination (Fig. 1). For example, the physiological regulator of myogenic tone is thought to be wall tension, the product of vessel transmural pressure and internal diameter (see Johnson²⁷). Yet, the ‘tension sensor’ that signals an alteration in wall tension to the contractile apparatus is unknown.² Furthermore, the mechanism of sustained myogenic contraction in response to prolonged elevations in intraluminal pressure has not been extensively investigated. It is not known whether intracellular [Ca²⁺] and LC₂₀ phosphorylation remain elevated for an extended period or whether the myofilaments become sensitized to the contractile effects of Ca²⁺, a mechanism stimulated by a number of vasoactive agents.

Prolonged increases in transmural pressure also induce remodelling of the vessel wall, with medial thickening and, in some vessels, vascular hypertrophy.²⁸,²⁹ The signalling mechanisms potentially involved in these pathways are the focus of the remainder of this article.

# TYROSINE PHOSPHORYLATION AND MYOGENIC ACTIVITY

Our recent studies have focused on a role for tyrosine phosphorylation in myogenic activity. Tyrosine kinase activity is relatively high in vascular smooth muscle cells compared with other cell types.³⁰ Furthermore, tyrosine kinases interact with various signalling pathways implicated in myogenic contraction. For example, tyrosine phosphorylation of L-type VOCC in rabbit ear artery smooth muscle cells increased the current carried by these channels.³¹ Integrins and focal adhesion complexes, which are possible candidates for the ‘tension sensor’ in myogenic activity mentioned above,⁴ are associated with a number of tyrosine kinases, such as cSrc and focal adhesion kinase (FAK), along with proteins activated by tyrosine phosphorylation, including the cytoskeletal proteins talin and paxillin. Previous studies in vascular and airway smooth muscle have shown that a mechanical stimulus can increase tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins including FAK, paxillin and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), a signalling molecule involved in gene transcription and growth responses.³²,³³

Initial experiments examined the effect of tyrosine kinase and phosphatase inhibitors on myogenic activity. Two structurally unrelated tyrosine kinase inhibitors, namely genistein and tyrphostin 47, dilated rat cremaster arterioles possessing spontaneous myogenic tone (Fig. 2). However, vessels retained their ability to constrict in response to an increase in transmural pressure despite the presence of the tyrosine kinase inhibitors; in effect, the inhibitors caused an upward shift of the pressure–diameter curve, an effect shared by many vasodilators (e.g. the adenylate cyclase activator forskolin), with no specific effect on myogenic constriction. Similarly, myogenic activity remained in the presence of the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor pervanadate, which constricted pressurized vessels (Fig. 2). Thus, while alterations in tyrosine phosphorylation interacted with basal or spontaneous myogenic tone, there appears to be no role for tyrosine phosphorylation in acute pressure-induced constriction of arterioles. In addition, neither the dilation nor constriction of pressurized arterioles caused by the tyrosine kinase or phosphatase inhibitors, respectively, was associated with a change in arteriolar wall [Ca²⁺].³⁴ This observation indicates that tyrosine phosphorylation pathways alter myogenic smooth muscle tone in the pressurized arteriole without affecting Ca²⁺ entry or release mechanisms or, indeed, overall intracellular [Ca²⁺]. This finding is in contrast with the effects of tyrosine kinase inhibitors on agonist-induced constrictions in other tissues.³⁵⁻³⁷

Despite the apparent lack of involvement of tyrosine phosphorylation in acute myogenic vasomotor responses, increased transmural pressure resulted in increased phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in smooth muscle cells. Phosphotyrosine formation in these small arterioles was assessed by fixing pressurized vessels and subsequent incubation with an fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated antibody to phosphotyrosine. Smooth muscle cell fluorescence was then measured using confocal scanning laser microscopy. These studies revealed that the time-course of phosphotyrosine accumulation

Phosphotyrosine was measured by incubating fixed vessels with a fluorophore-conjugated antibody to phosphotyrosine, then measurement of total smooth muscle fluorescence using confocal laser microscopy; LC₂₀ phosphorylation was assessed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and western blotting. For phosphotyrosine measurements, arterioles were subjected to a 30–100 mmHg pressure step at time 0, whereas data are presented for two different pressure steps for LC₂₀ phosphorylation: 70–100 mmHg ($n = 6$; ■; taken from Zou et al.⁷) and 50–120 mmHg ($n = 8$; □; Zou et al.⁸). Data are the mean±SEM. *$P < 0.05$ compared with pre-pressure step values (ANOVA followed by Student’s $t$-test.) Note the slow accumulation of phosphotyrosine residues compared with LC₂₀ phosphorylation and the time-course of the myogenic contraction (Fig. 4).

Fig. 4 Effect of the cSrc inhibitor PP1 (10 μmol/L; ●) on the time-course of myogenic constriction of rat isolated cannulated cremaster arterioles (■), control. At time 0, arterioles were subjected to an increase in intraluminal pressure from 30 to 100 mmHg and maintained at 100 mmHg for the following 60 min. Data are the mean±SEM. *$P < 0.05$ compared with diameter at time 5 min in the same group of tissues (ANOVA followed by Student’s $t$-test). Note that vessels are unable to maintain myogenic tone in the presence of PP1; however, this effect is not apparent until 40 min following the pressure step. At the pre-step pressure (30 mmHg), PP1 had a slight dilatory effect on the vessels that was not significant; similarly, the early rapid phase of myogenic constriction was not altered by PP1.

following an acute increase in vessel transmural pressure (from 30 to 100 mmHg) was relatively slow and clearly dissociated from both the increase in LC₂₀ phosphorylation and myogenic constriction (Fig. 3).³⁷,³⁸ A previous study in the same tissue showed LC₂₀ phosphorylation occurred within 10 s of the pressure stimulus⁸ and, in the present study, the myogenic constriction was largely completed within 1 min of the pressure stimulus (Fig. 4). However, phosphotyrosine formation did not increase significantly until 5 min after the stimulus and continued to rise over the following hour, during which time vessel diameter did not alter substantially (Figs 3,4). These observations support the idea that there is little requirement for tyrosine phosphorylation in acute myogenic constriction, but the slow increase in phosphotyrosine is consistent with a role in longer-term responses to elevated pressure. Such events may include maintenance of myogenic tone or the initiation of smooth muscle cell and arteriole wall remodelling or vascular hypertrophy.

### ROLE OF cSrc AND MAPK IN PRESSURE-INDUCED RESPONSES

An important question is which proteins are tyrosine phosphorylated in response to a change in intraluminal pressure? Investigations have focused on tyrosine kinases and other proteins associated with focal adhesion complexes, a likely site of mechanotransduction (conversion of a mechanical stimulus into a biochemical/cellular response) in pressurized vessels.⁴ The cSrc family of tyrosine kinases is one such candidate. cSrc phosphorylates a number of proteins involved in vascular smooth muscle contraction, including L-type VOCC³¹ and thin filament regulatory proteins, such as caldesmon. Other targets of cSrc include FAK and paxillin, both thought to be involved in cellular remodelling induced by mechanical stress. In addition, recent studies have shown that MAPK is also phosphorylated by cSrc.³⁸ Mitogen-activated protein kinase is involved in cell growth responses, requiring phosphorylation of both tyrosine and serine residues (the latter most probably by protein kinase C) for full activity. Increased wall tension in porcine carotid artery strips resulted in rapid activation of MAPK,³² which declined over a period of 2 h in the presence of the stimulus (stretch), although it should be noted that this tissue preparation does not display myogenic activity.

In pressurized cremaster arterioles, the cSrc inhibitor PP1 did not alter the acute phase of pressure-induced myogenic constriction, but myogenic tone was poorly maintained over a period of 20–40 min in the presence of PP1 (Fig. 4). The cSrc inhibitor had a complex

![Diagram](attachment:diagram.png)

Fig. 5 Possible divergent signalling mechanisms in the myogenic response. The early fast phase of the myogenic response involves depolarization-induced influx of Ca²⁺ through voltage-operated Ca²⁺ channels (VOCC) and activation of calmodulin (CaM)-dependent myosin light chain kinase (MLCK; see legend to Fig. 1). The delayed accumulation of phosphotyrosine suggests tyrosine phosphorylation pathways may be involved in more slowly activated pathways in response to increased transmural pressure, such as cytoskeletal remodelling or hypertrophic (growth) pathways. Evidence suggests roles for extracellular matrix (ECM)-coupled integrins, cSrc, focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in these responses. P, phosphorylation.

effect on the pressure–diameter interactions, dilating the vessels maintained at 30 mmHg but increasing constriction at 70 mmHg. One possible explanation for these effects is that PP1 inhibited interactions between focal adhesion-associated cSrc and the cytoskeleton, effectively ‘uncoupling’ the contractile proteins from the cytoskeleton and exaggerating cell length changes in response to myofilament lengthening or shortening. However, this hypothesis requires further evidence for support.

Our studies in arterioles from the rat cremaster muscle showed increased tyrosine phosphorylation of MAPK in response to increased pressure.³⁹ The time-course of the increase was similar to that in ‘total’ phosphotyrosine discussed above, with no rise in MAPK tyrosine phosphorylation in the first 2 min following the pressure increase, but elevated phosphorylation was evident after 15 min. An inhibitor of MAPK activation, the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK) inhibitor PD98059, had an effect on the pressure–diameter curve similar to that of the tyrosine kinase inhibitors in that it caused a general dilation of pressurized vessels while the arterioles remained responsive to increases in intraluminal pressure.³⁹ Some caution must be exercised in interpreting the effects of PD98059 because a recent study in mesenteric arterioles suggested the drug may inhibit vascular tone through other non-specific mechanisms.⁴⁰

Nevertheless, these results suggest that both cSrc and MAPK are activated by increased transmural pressure in cremaster arterioles. Whether these proteins are also directly involved in myogenic constriction is less certain and requires further investigation.

### TYROSINE PHOSPHORYLATION AND WALL TENSION

The physiological regulator of myogenic tone is thought to be vessel wall tension, the product of internal diameter and transmural pressure or a related variable (see Johnson²⁷). Myogenic constriction of the vessel reduces diameter in response to rising transmural pressure, thus opposing the subsequent rise in wall tension. Our studies appear to demonstrate a relationship between wall tension and phosphotyrosine formation in pressurized cremaster arterioles. Phosphotyrosine formation increased in proportion to pressure in the vessels but, if myogenic activity was abolished (by removal of Ca²⁺ from the bathing medium or by addition of the Ca²⁺ channel blocker verapamil), thus increasing the level of wall tension at a given pressure, phosphotyrosine formation was augmented.⁴¹ These observations are consistent with wall tension, rather than smooth muscle contraction or alterations in intracellular [Ca²⁺], being a key regulator of phosphotyrosine levels in smooth muscle cells. Similar observations were made in the presence of the vasodilator forskolin, which reduces arteriolar tone and increases wall tension through a cAMP-dependent mechanism.⁴²

The existence of a relationship between arteriole wall tension and phosphotyrosine levels is also supported by studies in rat mesenteric arterioles. In this vessel, elevated transmural pressure (and wall tension) induced expression of growth-associated proto-oncogenes *c-fos* and *c-myc* in vascular smooth muscle cells within 30 min.⁴³ Abolition of the myogenic response in these vessels augmented proto-oncogene expression, again suggesting a relationship with vessel wall tension.⁴⁴ A role for tyrosine kinases in these pathways was suggested by the observation that genistein inhibited pressure-induced *c-fos* expression.⁴⁵ In more recent studies, PP1 and PP2, a

related cSrc inhibitor, and the MAPK inhibitor PD98059 all inhibited pressure-induced *c-fos* expression in these vessels.³⁸ These observations imply a cSrc–MAPK pathway coupling increased vessel wall tension to *c-fos* expression, with tyrosine phosphorylation of target proteins providing a crucial link (Fig. 5).

## CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS

The above discussion may have implications for the ways in which blood vessels respond to increased intraluminal pressure and the modulation of a variable related to wall tension, wall stress. Wall stress is vessel wall tension (pressure × diameter) as a ratio of wall thickness. Thus, a similar increment in intraluminal pressure causes a proportionately greater increase in wall stress in a thin-walled vessel, for example an arteriole or venule, than a thick-walled vessel such as the aorta. In response to a sustained increase in intraluminal pressure, a blood vessel may reduce the resulting increase in wall stress by either reducing its internal diameter or increasing wall thickness. In practice, these two responses are manifested as increased myogenic tone and/or vessel wall remodelling and hypertrophy (see Parker *et al.*⁴⁶).

The consequences of these two responses to increased vessel wall stress can be seen in various animal models of hypertension. Hypertrophic remodelling of the vessel wall, including medial thickening, is observed in those vessels that demonstrate minimal myogenic reactivity, for example the aorta and femoral, renal and superior mesenteric arteries. Skeletal muscle arterioles, which possess robust pressure-induced myogenic constriction, display ‘euthrophic’ remodelling, a decrease in arteriolar diameter without an overt increase in wall thickness or any evidence of hypertrophy.⁴⁶,⁴⁷ This may be a consequence of sustained myogenic constriction. Myogenic responses are increased in isolated arterioles from hypertensive rats.⁴⁸,⁴⁹ Thus, vessels may respond to a sustained increase in intraluminal pressure by constricting or initiating a growth response.

Observed in this context, cell signalling in pressure-induced myogenic constriction may be resolved into two temporally and biochemically distinct pathways. The initial ‘fast’ myogenic constriction is due to rapid contraction of vascular smooth muscle cells mediated by Ca²⁺ entry through VOCC, activation of MLCK and increased LC₂₀ phosphorylation. The later responses to increased pressure, including sustained myogenic constriction and vessel wall remodelling, may be mediated by tyrosine phosphorylation pathways involving cSrc, MAPK and *c-fos* (Fig. 5). Such a model leaves other questions unanswered: is the same tension sensor (integrin/focal adhesion complex) responsible for both phases of the pressure-induced response? What are the roles of other signalling molecules involved in vascular smooth muscle contraction, such as protein kinase C and rho-activated kinase? How is the stimulus maintained once myogenic constriction has reduced wall tension? These questions require further investigation, which will require sophisticated imaging, cellular and molecular approaches.
