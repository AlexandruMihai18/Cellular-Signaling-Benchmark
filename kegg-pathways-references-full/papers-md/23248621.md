HTLV-1 infection of DCs is essential for initial viral spread (Jones et al., 2008). These observations are very critical in understanding the development of adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL), because HTLV-1 must spread rapidly to its target cells to establish a latent infection and avoid clearance by the immune system.

Human T-lymphotropic virus type-1 cell free

newly synthesized, less glycosylated MHC-1-Hc before it forms a heterodimer with β2-microglobulin (Johnson et al., 2001; Johnson and Franchini, 2002). Three different human MHC-1-Hc-A2, B7, and Cw4 complexes were tested and all of them interacted with p12.
is notable that when p12 was expressed naturally in the HTLV-1 molecular clone, it still decreased the cells' dependency on IL-2 (Nicot et al., 2001).

### p12 DEREGULATES Ca²⁺ AND NFAT

Except for the Jak/STAT pathway, p12 also has the ability to activate another important T cell transcription factor, the NFAT.
amino acids 221–254 of p30's c-terminus are not involved in HR. Notably, p30 was demonstrated to interact with both nibrin (NBS1) and RAD50, but not MRE11, and p30 was able to reduce the assembly of functional Mre11–Rad50–NBS1 (MRN
