## Summary

Bright blue or red flowers in the Japanese morning glory (*Ipomoea nil*) contain anthocyanidin 3-O-sophoroside derivatives, whereas the reddish-brown or purplish-gray petals in its *dusky* mutants accumulate anthocyanidin 3-O-glucoside derivatives. The *Dusky* gene was found to encode a novel glucosyltransferase, UDP-glucose:anthocyanidin 3-O-glucoside-2′-O-glucosyltransferase (3GGT), which mediates the glucosylation of anthocyanidin 3-O-glucosides to yield anthocyanidin 3-O-sophorosides. *Ipomoea nil* carries one copy of the 3GGT gene that contains no intron and produces 1.6-kbp transcripts mainly in the petals and tubes of flower buds at around 24 h before flower opening. The gene products of both *In3GGT* in *I. nil* and *Ip3GGT* in the common morning glory (*Ipomoea purpurea*) comprise 459 amino acids and showed a close relationship to the petunia UDP-rhamnose:anthocyanidin 3-O-glucoside-6″-O-rhamnosyltransferase (3RT), which controls the addition of a rhamnose molecule to anthocyanidin 3-O-glucosides for conversion into anthocyanidin 3-O-rutinosides. All of the 30 *dusky* mutants tested were found to carry the 4-bp insertion mutations GGAT or CGAT at an identical position near the 3′ end of the gene, and the insertions caused frameshift mutations. The expected 3GGT enzymatic activities were found in the crude extracts of *Escherichia coli*, in which the 3GGT cDNA of *I. nil* or *I. purpurea* was expressed, while no such activity was detected in the extracts expressed with the *dusky* mutant cDNAs containing 4-bp insertions. Moreover, the introduced *Ip3GGT* cDNA efficiently produced 3GGT that converted cyanidin 3-O-glucoside into cyanidin 3-O-sophoroside in transgenic petunia plants.

## Introduction

Flower color is an important floricultural trait in ornamental plants, and various flower colors, such as orange, red, purple, blue, and blue-black, are mainly the result of the accumulation of diverse structures of anthocyanins in the petal vacuoles, although additional factors, including co-pigmentation, vacuolar pH, and cell shape, also affect flower hue (Brouillard and Dangles, 1994; Davies and Schwinn, 1997; Honda and Saito, 2002; Mol et al., 1998).

Nearly all structural genes that encode enzymes to produce anthocyanidin 3-O-glucosides (Figure 1), which are the first major stable colored pigments in the anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway, and many regulatory genes for the transcriptional activation of the structural genes have been identified and characterized (Forkmann and Martens, 2001; Mol *et al.*, 1998; Tanaka *et al.*, 1998; Winkel-Shirley, 2001). Further modifications of anthocyanidin 3-O-glucosides, such as glycosylation, acylation, and methylation, which are involved in the fine adjustment and stabilization of flower pigmentation, can occur in a species-specific manner (Heller and Forkmann, 1994). However, only limited information about the genes responsible for these modifications of anthocyanidin 3-O-glucosides or their derivatives is available. For example, the structure of mutations in the petunia *Rt* gene encoding UDP-rhamnose:anthocyanidin

The anthocyanin pigment in dark-purple flowers of the wild-type *I. purpurea* plant is also shown. To distinguish the three caffeic acid molecules in HBA and WBA, we arbitrarily designate them as caffeic acid (I), (II), and (III).

(g) Major anthocyanin pigments in the flowers of the *dusky* mutants.

(h) Reaction mediated by the *Dusky* gene products, 3GGT. Although delphinidin 3-O-glucoside is not produced in *I. nil* and *I. purpurea*, it serves as a good substrate for the 3GGT enzyme (see Figure 4).

3-O-glucoside-6′-O-rhamnosyltransferase (3RT), which controls the conversion of anthocyanidin 3-O-glucosides into anthocyanidin 3-O-rutinosides, and its cDNA have been characterized (Brugliera *et al.*, 1994; Kroon *et al.*, 1994). Other cDNAs cloned and characterized include the cDNAs encoding UDP-glucose:anthocyanin 5-O-glucosyltransferase (5GT) from perilla, verbena, and petunia (Yamazaki *et al.*, 1999, 2002), UDP-glucose:anthocyanin 3′-O-glucosyltransferase (3′GT) from gentian (Fukuchi-Mizutani *et al.*, 2003), malonyl-CoA:anthocyanin 3-O-glucoside-6″-O-malonyltransferase (3MaT) from dahlia (Suzuki *et al.*, 2001), malonyl-CoA:anthocyanin 5-O-glucoside-6″-O-malonyltransferase (5MaT) and malonyl-CoA:anthocyanin 5-O-glucoside-4″-O-malonyltransferase (5MaT2) from salvia (Suzuki *et al.*, 2002, 2004), hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA:anthocyanin 5-O-glucoside-6″-O-acyltransferase (5AT) and hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA:anthocyanin 3-O-glucoside-6″-O-acyltransferase (3AT) from gentian and perilla, respectively (Fujiwara *et al.*, 1998; Yonekura-Sakakibara *et al.*, 2000). Apart from those on the petunia *Rt* gene, no other reports have focused on the description of the genomic structures of the genes for the modifications of anthocyanidin 3-O-glucosides, the identification of mutations in these genes, and the phenotypic characterization of their mutants.

The Japanese morning glory (*Ipomoea nil*) displays bright blue flowers (Figure 1b) that contain the peonidin (3′-methylocyanidin) 3-O-sophoroside derivative named Heavenly Blue Anthocyanin (HBA) (Figure 1f; Kondo *et al.*, 1987; Lu *et al.*, 1992), and a number of spontaneous mutants exhibiting various flower colors have been isolated since the 17th century (Iida *et al.*, 1999, 2004; Imai, 1927). Genetic studies on the color of *I. nil* have shown that blue flower coloration was mainly controlled by two genetic loci, Magenta and Purple (Hagiwara, 1931; Imai, 1931). Recessive magenta and purple mutants bloom magenta and purple flowers, respectively, and double mutants carrying both magenta and purple alleles display red flowers (Figure 1d). The Magenta gene was shown to encode flavonoid 3′-hydroxylase, which hydroxylates the 3′ position of the B-ring of anthocyanidin precursors (Figure 1a), and all the magenta mutants tested were found to carry a single nonsense mutation (Hoshino *et al.*, 2003). The Purple gene was identified to encode a vacuolar Na⁺/H⁺ exchanger called InNHX1 that increases the vacuolar pH during flower opening, causing a shift towards blue coloration, and all the purple mutants tested contained the same allele caused by the integration of the DNA transposon *Tpn4* into the *InNHX1* gene (Fukada-Tanaka *et al.*, 2000, 2001; Yamaguchi *et al.*, 2001). Among the various colors of *I. nil* flowers, the most favorite hue for Japanese floriculturists has been reddish-brown or purplish-gray petals (Figure 1c,e) since the early 19th century, and the flower coloration is caused by recessive dusky mutations (Hagiwara, 1956; Imai, 1931). In the petals of the dusky

mutants, major anthocyanins identified were anthocyanidin 3-O-glucosylcaffeoylglucosides and their 5-O-glucoside derivatives (Figure 1g; Saito *et al.*, 1994, 1996), suggesting that the activity of UDP-glucose:anthocyanidin 3-O-glucoside-2″-O-glucosyltransferase (3GGT), which catalyzes the production of anthocyanidin 3-O-sophorosides, must be low. Here, we report the isolation of *In3GGT* and *Ip3GGT* cDNA clones from the Japanese morning glory and the common morning glory (*Ipomoea purpurea*), respectively, and demonstrate the conversion of anthocyanidin 3-O-glucosides into anthocyanidin 3-O-sophorosides (Figure 1h) in the extracts of *Escherichia coli*, in which the 3GGT cDNA is expressed. We have also identified the dusky mutations of *I. nil* in the gene encoding the In3GGT enzyme and discussed the possible origin of the spontaneous dusky mutations. We subsequently examined the mode of expression of the *In3GGT* gene in *I. nil* plants and showed the conversion of cyanidin 3-O-glucoside into cyanidin 3-O-sophoroside in transgenic petunia plants in which the *Ip3GGT* cDNA is expressed.

## Results

### Flower coloration of dusky mutants

Table 1 shows the flower color phenotypes of the *I. nil* lines used, most of which carry the dusky mutations. Although their flower coloration may subtly vary due to various genetic backgrounds, the dusky mutants carrying the wild-type Magenta allele generally exhibit bluish or purplish-gray flowers that contain cyanidin derivatives, whereas those with the magenta mutation tend to display reddish-brown flowers that contain pelargonidin derivatives, as represented in Figure 1(c,e). Among them, Magenta plants with the wild-type Purple or Purple-revertant allele show a tendency to produce more bluish-gray flowers than those with the purple mutation. Similarly, magenta mutants with the Purple or Purple-revertant allele generally exhibit darker reddish-brown flowers than those with the purple mutation. We noticed that the petals in all of the dusky mutations examined often contained intensely pigmented globules, also called anthocyanic vacuolar inclusions (Markham *et al.*, 2000), in the vacuoles of their epidermal cells (Figure 1c,e), whereas petals in the Dusky plants showed no such globules (Figure 1b,d). As the globules were found in both Purple and purple flowers, they formed even in the vacuoles at around pH 7 (Yamaguchi *et al.*, 2001).

### Isolation of novel cDNAs encoding glycosyltransferases

The dark purple flowers of *I. purpurea* contain a cyanidin 3-O-sophoroside derivative that lacks one glucose molecule and a methyl group from HBA (Figure 1f; Saito *et al.*,

The genetic symbols $Mg$, $Pr$, $Dy$, and $Y$ represent Magenta, Purple, Dusky and Yellow, respectively. The $I$. $nil$ lines in our collection are part of the collection at Kyushu University (http://mg.biology.kyushu-u.ac.jp/index.html). Each flower color was taken from the adaxial petal part of individual flowers. Two dusky mutant alleles, $dy-1$ and $dy-2$, are shown in Figure 3(c). All magenta mutants tested carry the single nonsense mutation $mg-1$ (Hoshino et al., 2003). Likewise, all purple mutants tested are caused by the identical insertion of $Tpn4$ in the $Tpn1$ family into the untranslated exon 1 of the Purple gene (Fukada-Tanaka et al., 2000, 2001; Yamaguchi et al., 2001). Although some of the purple mutants display variegated flowers and others exhibit rather stable and uniformly colored flowers with occasional fine spots, we designated the mutation as $pr-m1$. The two Purple-revertant alleles, $Pr-r11$ and $Pr-r12$, contain 3-bp insertions, CAG and CTG, at the $Tpn4$ insertion site, respectively, and they are footprints generated by independent $Tpn4$ excisions (Fukada-Tanaka et al., 2000). The wild-type and recessive-mutant alleles at the Yellow locus, which confer darker-green- and yellow-green-leaf phenotypes, are denoted here with a $+$ and $-$, respectively. Three lines named Danjuro from different sources used here appear to be of at least two different origins because the dusky alleles are different. The line Benkei (Tak) is probably a $Pr-r$ revertant of the line Q1210/Benkei.

1995). When isolating cDNA clones coding for enzymes to modify anthocyanidin 3-O-glucosides from young flower buds of $I$. $purpurea$, we obtained a novel cDNA clone apparently encoding an enzyme for glycosylation (see Experimental procedures), the deduced amino acid sequence of which showed about 43% identity to that of the petunia $Rt$ cDNA (Figure 2a; Brugliera et al., 1994;

Figure 3. Structure and expression of the Dusky gene.

(a) Southern blot analysis of the In3GGT gene. DNA (10 μg) was digested with restriction enzymes NheI and XbaI and hybridized with the In3GGT cDNA as a probe. Lane 1, TKS; lane 2, KK/ZSK-2; lane 3, Q856; lane 4, Danjuro (Tak); lane 5, Benkei (Tak); lane 6, Unzen-no-maki (Tak).

(b) A structure of the 10.2-kbp XbaI fragment containing the In3GGT gene. The 3GGT gene contains no intron. The gray and black boxes indicate the coding and putative C-terminal UDP binding motif regions, respectively. The large vertical arrow indicates the site of 4-bp insertions, and small horizontal arrows represent the site and orientation of the primers.

(c) The 4-bp insertions indicated by the upper lines in the dusky mutants result in frameshift mutations. The underlines with GAT indicate reminiscent sequences of hypothetical target site duplications. Asterisks indicate the ends of proteins.

(d) RT-PCR analysis for spatial expression of the In3GGT gene in the wild-type line TKS. The *I. nil* DFR-B gene for anthocyanin biosynthesis (Inagaki et al., 1999) and the constitutively expressed γ-sub gene for mitochondrial F₁F₀ ATP synthase γ-subunit in *I. nil* (A. Hoshino, unpublished data) were used for comparison. The numerals in parenthesis indicate cycles of PCR amplification.

(e) Northern blot analysis for the temporal expression of the 3GGT gene in petals of young buds of the line TKS. The numerals above indicate the time (h) of the RNA preparation before flower opening. Total RNA (10 μg) was separated and hybridized with an appropriate probe, the *I. nil* 3GGT cDNA or *I. nil* DFR-B cDNA. The ethidium bromide-stained rRNA bands are shown as a loading control.

(f) Northern blot analysis of the In3GGT gene expression in dusky and c-1 mutants. Total RNAs were prepared from petals of flower buds at 36 h before flower opening, and the *I. nil* 3GGT cDNA was used as a probe. Lane 1, TSK; lane 2, KK/ZSK-2; lane 3, Q856; lane 4, Benkei (Tak); lane 5, 78WWc-1.

results agree with previous results, which show that these dusky lines carry either the dy-1 or the dy-2 mutation (Table 1). These results are consistent with the notion that the Dusky gene encodes the putative In3GGT enzyme and that the dusky mutations are 4-bp insertions. The notion was further supported by the fact that the expression of the putative 3GGT gene of *I. nil* was mainly expressed in the petals and tubes of flower buds, where the genes for anthocyanin biosynthesis, represented by the DFR-B gene, were expressed and anthocyanin pigments were consequently accumulated (Figure 3d). Northern blot analysis also showed that its transcripts accumulated most at approximately 24 h before flower opening, which appeared to be slightly later than DFR-B transcript accumulation (Figure 3e). Moreover, the expression of the putative In3GGT gene was significantly reduced in the c-1 mutant (Figure 3f), which is deficient in the function of the MYB transcriptional activator for anthocyanin biosynthesis, and the mRNA accumulation

of its structural genes was known to be reduced considerably (Fukada-Tanaka et al., 1997; Hoshino et al., 1997, 2003; Y. Morita, unpublished data), indicating that the putative In3GGT gene is regulated by the C-1 protein.

Enzymatic characterization of the Dusky gene product expressed in E. coli

To examine whether the Dusky gene indeed encodes the 3GGT enzyme, we first cloned the *I. nil* cDNA for the putative In3GGT enzyme into the *E. coli* expression vector pQE30, transformed it into *E. coli*, and analyzed the enzymatic activity of the gene product in the *E. coli* crude extracts (see Experimental procedures). Figure 4 shows typical examples of such experiments. The crude extracts containing the expected protein of 51.2 kDa (data not shown) were able to convert cyanidin 3-O-glucoside into cyanidin 3-O-sophoroside (Figures 1h and 4a), which

detected in the *dusky* genes with the CGAT insertion (Figure 4b) or with the GGAT insertion (data not shown). The results confirmed that the *Dusky* gene encodes 3GGT, which mediates the conversion of anthocyanidin 3-O-glucosides into anthocyanidin 3-O-sophorosides.

Expression of the *I*. purpurea *Ip3GGT* cDNA in transgenic petunia

As the products of the obtained 3GGT genes promote the conversion of cyanidin 3-O-glucoside into cyanidin 3-O-sophoroside, we asked whether the same conversion could occur in heterologous transgenic plants having the introduced *Ip3GGT* cDNA expressed. For this purpose, we chose the petunia plant cultivar Vacara Red (Ando *et al.*, 2000), which exhibits red flowers (Figure 5a) and contains cyanidin 3-O-glucoside and cyanidin 3-O-sophoroside as major anthocyanins (38 and 32% of total anthocyanins, respectively). Of 14 independent transgenic plants generated, seven accumulated the introduced *Ip3GGT* mRNA (Figure 5c), and the peak profiles of high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis indicated that these transgenic petunia flowers expressing the *Ip3GGT* gene showed varied amounts of cyanidin 3-O-sophoroside from 30 to 80% of total anthocyanins generally depending on the

degree of expression level of the *Ip3GGT* gene. In the transgenic petunia plant PT102-10, which accumulated the highest amount of cyanidin 3-*O*-sophoroside and displayed reddish flowers (Figure 5b), virtually no cyanidin 3-*O*-glucoside was present in the petals. The production of cyanidin 3-sophoroside in the extract of PT102-10 flowers was further supported by liquid chromatography-quadrupole liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-Q LC-MS) analysis, in which the peak *m/z* 611 \[M\]^+^ was detected as the major peak. Therefore, the introduced *Ip3GGTcDNA* of *I. purpurea* could efficiently produce UDP-glucose:anthocyanidin 3-*O*-glucosyltransferase, which can glucosylate cyanidin 3-*O*-glucoside to cyanidin 3-*O*-sophoroside as a single major constituent in the transgenic petunia flower, although its hue is not drastically changed.

### Discussion

We showed that the *I. nil Dusky* gene and its *I. purpurea* orthologous gene encode 3GGT enzymes that add a glucose molecule to anthocyanidin 3-*O*-glucosides forming anthocyanidin 3-*O*-sophorosides (Figure 1h). Apart from the petunia *Rt* gene, the 3GGT gene described here is the only isolated gene encoding the UDP-glycosyltransferase that adds a sugar residue to the glucose moiety of anthocyanin. Not only the pelargonidin and cyanidin derivatives found in *I. nil* and *I. purpurea* but also delphinidin 3-*O*-glucoside, which is absent in these *Ipomoea* flowers, can serve as a good substrate (Figure 4e). However, anthocyanidin 3,5-*O*-diglucosides could not serve as a substrate (Figure 4c,f) even though they are found in the petals of *dusky* mutants (Saito *et al.*, 1994, 1996). Major anthocyanins identified in the petals of the *dusky* mutants conferring reddish-brown or purplish-gray flowers were anthocyanidin 3-*O*-glucosylcaffeoylglucosides and their 5-*O*-glucoside derivatives (Figure 1g; Saito *et al.*, 1994, 1996), and intensely pigmented globules were observed in the vacuoles of their epidermal cells (Figure 1c,e). The pigmented globules, or anthocyanic vacuolar inclusions, are known to have a certain profound effect on both flower color and intensity (Markham *et al.*, 2000). It is thus likely that reddish-brown or purplish-gray flower coloration in *dusky* mutants is due not only to the accumulation of anthocyanidin 3-*O*-glucosylcaffeoylglucosides and their 5-*O*-glucoside derivatives in their petals (Figure 1g; Saito *et al.*, 1994, 1996) but also to the appearance of intensely pigmented globules in the vacuoles (Figure 1c,e).

We also showed that *dusky* mutations in *I. nil* conferring reddish-brown or purplish-gray flowers are insertion mutations of 4 bp, GGAT or CGAT, at the same position near the 3′ terminus of the *Dusky* gene (Figure 3b,c). Close inspection of the insertions revealed that their 3′ common trinucleotides GAT can also be found 5′ adjacent to these 4-bp insertions: the wild-type sequence GAT has changed into GAT(G/C)GAT. We speculate that these 4-bp insertion sequences are footprints generated by excision of a DNA transposon in the *Tpn1* family. The transposons in the *Tpn1* family, which belong to the *En/Spm* superfamily and are thought to have acted as major mutagens for the generation of various floricultural traits in *I. nil*, generate 3-bp target site duplications upon their integrations and can generate 4-bp insertions as footprints upon their excisions (Hoshino *et al.*, 2001; Iida *et al.*, 1999, 2004; Inagaki *et al.*, 1996; Kawasaki and Nitasaka, 2004). It is thus likely that two *dusky* alleles, insertions of GGAT or CGAT, were generated by two independent excision events of an integrated *Tpn1*-related element that must be flanked by 3-bp direct repeats of GAT generated as target duplications upon integration near the 3′ end of the *In3GGT* gene. We also examined the *dusky* mutations in the yellow mutants (Table 1), which confer yellow-green leaves and are tightly linked to the *dusky* allele (Hagiwara, 1956; Imai, 1929). Only the *dy-2* allele with the insertion of CGAT was found in all the yellow mutants tested. As Japanese floriculturists who favor reddish-brown or purplish-gray flowers of *I. nil* have taken advantage of the tight linkage between *dusky* and yellow to select the mutants with the recessive *dusky* allele in the homozygous condition over a century, our results indicate that the *dusky* allele in *I. nil* mutants with yellow-green leaves was probably derived from a single progenitor, in which a putative *Tpn1*-relative had been excised from the *In3GGT* gene characterized here. Likewise, the Purple allele in the *dusky* and yellow double mutants tested was not the wild-type allele but the identical revertant allele, *Pr-r12*, which probably originated from a single progenitor, in which an excision of *Tpn4* in the *Tpn1* family from the *InNHX1* gene had occurred (Table 1; Fukada-Tanaka *et al.*, 2000).

The major anthocyanins that accumulated in the petals of the *dusky* mutants were anthocyanidin 3-*O*-glucosylcaffeoylglucosides and their 5-*O*-glucoside derivatives (Figure 1g; Saito *et al.*, 1994, 1996; Toki *et al.*, 2001), indicating that the addition of the caffeoyl molecule (I) to anthocyanidin 3-*O*-glucosides could occur in the absence of 3GGT activity. In these accumulated anthocyanins, the position of the outer glucosyl residue is curiously attached at the 3 position of the caffeoyl moiety (I) in Figure 1(g), whereas the corresponding glucose molecule in HBA is attached at the 4 position of the same caffeoyl moiety (I) in Figure 1(f). Interestingly, the outmost two glucose molecules in HBA are attached at the 3 position of the caffeoyl moieties (II) and (III) in Figure 1(f). Perhaps, the glycosyltransferase that mediates the addition of a glucose molecule to the caffeoyl moiety (I) requires anthocyanidin 3-*O*-caffeoysophorosides and fails to transfer the glucose moiety to the 4 position of the caffeoyl moiety (I) of anthocyanidin 3-*O*-caffeoyslglucosides that are accumulated in the *dusky* mutants. Under such circumstances, another glycosyltransferase, which usually catalyzes the addition of a glucose molecule to the 3 position

of the caffeoyl moieties (II) and (III), can promote the transfer of the glucose molecule into the 3 position of the caffeoyl moiety (I) that results in anthocyanidin 3-O-glucosylcaffeoylglucosides and their 5-O-glucoside derivatives (Figure 1f,g; Saito *et al.*, 1994, 1996). Such flexibility in anthocyanin biosynthesis is likely to be an important factor for exhibiting diverse flower hues in various mutants of the Japanese morning glory.

### Experimental procedures

#### Plant materials

All *I. nil* lines used are listed in Table 1 except for the *c-1* mutant 78WWc-1 (Abe *et al.*, 1997; Hoshino *et al.*, 2003). The *I. purpurea* line used for the preparation of the bud cDNA library was YO/FP-39, which bears dark-purple flowers (Habu *et al.*, 1998; Hoshino *et al.*, 2003).

#### Nucleic acid procedures

General nucleic acid procedures, including plant DNA and RNA preparation, Northern and Southern blot analyses, plaque hybridization, PCR amplification, and DNA sequencing analysis, were performed as described before (Habu *et al.*, 1998; Hisatomi *et al.*, 1997; Hoshino *et al.*, 2003; Yamaguchi *et al.*, 2001). The presence of the purple allele in Table 1 was determined by PCR amplification (Fukada-Tanaka *et al.*, 2001), and the magenta allele was by PCR amplification followed by sequence determination of the amplified fragments (Hoshino *et al.*, 2003). To determine the Purple-revertant mutations, *Pr-r11* and *Pr-r12*, the 0.5-kbp PCR fragments containing the footprints caused by the excision of *Tpn4* from the exon 1 region of the *InNHX1* gene (Fukada-Tanaka *et al.*, 2001) were obtained with the primers EX1FW2 (5′-TACTGATAGGAGAGTTGTCGTTCC-3′) and EX2RV (5′-CAATGTCGTGGTTTCTGTTCCACATA-3′) and sequenced directly.

For the isolation of a cDNA clone encoding *Ip3GGT* of *I. purpurea*, first-strand cDNAs were synthesized from total RNAs isolated from flower buds of YO/FP-39 using the SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) with the primer Not27-dT18 (5′-AACTGGAAAGAATTCGCGGCCGCAGGAATTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT-3′), and subsequent PCR amplification with the primers ATC1 (5′-GAYTTYGGITGGGGIAA-3′) and Not27 (5′-AACTGGGAATTCGCGGCCGCAGGAA-3′) yielded a probe for screening a cDNA library prepared from the flower buds of YO/FP-39 (Hoshino *et al.*, 2003) under low-stringency hybridization conditions (Hisatomi *et al.*, 1997). One of the clones isolated apparently contained the sequence for a glycosyltransferase. Subsequently, the corresponding cDNA of *I. nil* was also obtained from a cDNA library from the flower buds of KK/ZSK2 (Inagaki *et al.*, 1999).

To determine the genomic *In3GGT* sequence of *I. nil*, the 10.2-kbp Xbal fragment of KK/ZSK-2 containing the entire *In3GGT* gene was cloned into the λDASH II vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA) and sequenced. To analyze the *dusky* mutations, the 4.5-kbp segments containing the entire *In3GGT* gene from KK/ZSK-2, TKS, Danjuro (Tak), Akatsuki-no-yume, Unzen-no-maki (Tak), Q105, Q114, Q188, Q856, and Q1210 were obtained by PCR amplification using LA Taq polymerase (Takara Biomedicals, Ohtsu, Japan) with the primers Dy-1F (5′-TCTAGAACCTTCAGCAAATAAGATGC-3′) and Dy-1R (5′-TGGTCTTGTATCTCATACTTTCAACT-3′) and directly sequenced. Subsequently, the 1.5-kbp PCR fragments containing the entire

**A novel glucosyltransferase gene and its mutants** 361

The *In3GGT* gene from 22 additional *dusky* mutants (Table 1) were obtained with the primers Dy-2F (5′-CAGAAAGCTAGCTAGCT-AGGTATAGG-3′) and Dy-2R (5′-CTAGCTCAAGGCAGTGATACC-3′) and sequenced directly.

For reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) analysis, total RNAs were prepared from petal, tube, anther, stigma, and sepal of buds as well as leaf blade, petiole, and stem of young plants. The primers used for RT-PCR amplification were *In3GGT* cDNA, Dy-2F mentioned above and Dy-3R (5′-GAGGATGATCTCAATGTCGTTCTGG-3′); *DFR-B* cDNA, DFR-BFJ-5F (5′-ACGAGGCTACCATATTCACGCCACC-3′) and DFR-BFJ-7R (5′-ATGTTGAGCACTCCATTGGATGGCTG-3′); γ-subunit cDNA for mitochondrial F₁F₀ ATP synthase γ-subunit, JMFS029C1-3F (5′-ATCAAGCCGTTAAGAGCAAACC-3′) and JMFS029C1-3R (5′-AATATCCGGCTTGTCTTGGACAG-3′). First-strand cDNAs were synthesized using SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), and AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) was used for subsequent PCR amplification. For *In3GGT* and *DFR-B* cDNAs, the PCR reaction was carried out for initial denaturation at 95°C for 9 min, 21 or 23 cycles of denaturation (95°C for 30 sec), annealing and extension (68°C for 1 min), and additional extension at 72°C for 10 min. For the γ-subunit cDNA, we slightly modified the annealing and extension temperature to 65°C.

### Biochemical analysis in E. coli

The 3GGT sequences of the wild-type *I. nil* line, its *dusky* mutants containing either CGAT or GGAT sequences, and the wild-type *I. purpurea* plant were inserted into the expression vector pQE30 or pQE61 (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The reaction mixture for the 3GGT enzymatic assay consisted of 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5), 0.6 mm delphinidin 3-O-glucoside, cyanidin 3-O-glucoside or delphinidin 3,5-O-diglucoside, 1 mm UDP-glucose, and 20 μl of crude *E. coli* extracts as the enzyme solution in a volume of 100 μl. The reaction was started by adding an anthocyanin and stopped by an equal volume of 90% (v/v) acetonitrile with 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) after incubation for 15 min at 30°C. Twenty microliters of a reaction mixture was applied on a reverse-phase column and separated as previously described (Fukuchi-Mizutani *et al.*, 2003). The authentic cyanidin 3-O-sophoroside was purchased from Polyphenoles Laboratories (Sandnes, Norway). A large-scale reaction with 2.5 mg of either cyanidin 3-O-glucoside or delphinidin 3-O-glucoside, UDP-glucose and In3GGT proteins, which were purified by Chelating Sepharose Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ, USA) charged with Ni, was performed, and the products were separated by reverse-phase HPLC using a Polymer C18 column (30 cm × 2 cm; YMC Co., Ltd, Kyoto, Japan) with a gradient elution (after 10 min isocratic elution of 10% CH₃CN containing 0.5% TFA in H₂O, 40 min linear gradient elution from 10 to 25% CH₃CN, and then 5 min isocratic elution of 25% CH₃CN containing 0.5% TFA in H₂O at a flow rate of 6 ml min⁻¹) and detected with photodiode array detector SPD-M6A (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). We obtained two fractions in the reaction with cyanidin 3-O-glucoside: a fraction containing cyanidin 3-O-glucoside eluted at 52.7 min and a new fraction eluted at 44.3 min that was subjected to MS analysis. Similarly, a fraction eluted at 43.2 min was obtained and subjected to MS analysis in addition to the fraction containing delphinidin 3-O-glucoside eluted at 51.0 min in the reaction with delphinidin 3-O-glucoside. ESI-MS of these new products was obtained by Q-TOF with z-spray ion source (Micromass, Manchester, UK) in positive mode.

# Production of transgenic petunia plants

The *Ip3GGTcDNA* of *I. purpurea* was inserted between an enhanced CaMV35S promoter and nopaline synthase terminator in a binary vector and transformed into *Petunia hybrida* cultivar Vacara Red (Sakata Seeds Ltd, Yokohama, Japan) with *Agrobacterium tumefaciens* strain Agl0 (Lazo *et al.*, 1991) as described previously (Fukuchi-Mizutani *et al.*, 2003). Expression of the *Ip3GGT* gene in the transgenic petunia plants was confirmed with RT-PCR with a pair of the specific primers for the *Ip3GGT* gene. The resulted fragments were detected by Southern blot analysis. The extracts of petals of the host and a transgenic petunia were analyzed with the LC-O LC-MS system (Thermo Quest, San Jose, CA, USA) using an ODP-40 3D column (15 cm × 3 mm; Shoko. Co., Ltd, Tokyo, Japan) with a gradient elution (10 min linear gradient of 10–50% of acetonitrile containing 0.6 N HCl followed by 5 min of isocratic elution of 50% of acetonitrile containing 0.6 N HCl at a flow rate of 0.3 ml min⁻¹). The detection was carried out with an ESI probe in the positive mode and absorption at 520 nm. Under these conditions, the retention time and molecular ions of cyanidin 3-O-sophoroside and cyanidin 3-O-glucoside were 7.28 min and *m/z* 611[M]⁺ and 7.77 min and *m/z* 449[M]⁺, respectively.
