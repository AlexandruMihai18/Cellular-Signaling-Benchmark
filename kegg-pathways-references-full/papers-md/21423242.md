# Pathogenesis of pituitary tumors

**Shlomo Melmed**

**Abstract** | Pituitary adenomas may hypersecrete hormones (including prolactin, growth hormone and adrenocorticotropic hormone, luteinizing hormone or TSH) or may be nonfunctional. Despite their high prevalence in the general population, these tumors are invariably benign and exhibit features of differentiated pituitary cell function as well as premature proliferative arrest. Pathogenesis of dysregulated pituitary cell proliferation and unrestrained hormone hypersecretion may be mediated by hypothalamic, intrapituitary and/or peripheral factors. Altered expression of pituitary cell cycle genes, activation of pituitary selective oncproteins or loss of pituitary suppressor factors may be associated with aberrant growth factor signaling. Considerable information on the etiology of these tumors has been derived from transgenic animal models, which may not accurately and universally reflect human tumor pathophysiology. Understanding subcellular mechanisms that underlie pituitary tumorigenesis will enable development of tumor aggression markers as well as novel targeted therapies.

## Introduction

The anterior pituitary gland synthesizes and secretes adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), growth hormone (GH), prolactin, TSH, follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone. These trophic hormones selectively regulate target gland hormone synthesis and secretion to elicit peripheral tissue effects. Complex control of anterior pituitary function involves hypothalamic, intrapituitary and peripheral signals. Pituitary cell integration of these three tiers of control results in coordinated regulation of differentiated pituitary hormone synthesis and secretion, as well as selective regulation of pituitary cell proliferation. Hypothalamic releasing and inhibiting hormones traverse portal vessels to impinge upon differentiated anterior pituitary cell types, and signal transduction cascades activated by hypothalamic hormones control pituitary hormone synthesis and cell replication. Intrapituitary autocrine or paracrine growth factors and peripheral endocrine hormones exert mainly negative feedback control of pituitary trophic hormone synthesis and cell replication. The net result of tiered pituitary control is integration of vital functions including development, growth, reproduction, stress and metabolic homeostasis.

## Pituitary cell proliferation

Lineage-specific pituitary cell development arising in Rathke pouch cells is tightly regulated by cell cycle proteins, which enables the expansion of a population of highly specific early pituitary progenitor cells and their progression to terminally differentiated, hormone-expressing pituitary cells. Deficiency in the function of early nuclear transcription factors or cell cycle regulators leads to pituitary hypoplasia and a varying clinical spectrum of selective pituitary secretory failure and hypoplasia. In mouse models, targeted deletion of cell cycle regulator genes including cyclin dependent kinase 1 and pituitary tumor-transforming gene 1 also result in postnatal pituitary hypoplasia.

Although turnover of adult pituitary cells is slow, the pituitary gland exhibits a plastic response to extrinsic stimuli throughout the lifespan. Postnatally, trophic and inhibitory hypothalamic hormones maintain an equilibrium of appropriate pituitary cell mass, while peripheral hormones exert negative feedback regulation on respective pituitary trophic cell growth and hormone secretion. Mechanisms that potentiate pituitary cell proliferation are manifest during puberty, pregnancy, the estrous cycle and in states of peripheral hormone deficiencies owing to target organ failure. Physiological regulation of pituitary cell proliferation is enabled by both intrapituitary and humoral factor signaling. For example, lactotroph cell hyperplasia during pregnancy occurs mostly because of elevated estrogen levels, which induce pro-angiogenic pituitary factors including securin (encoded by PTTG1), heparin-binding growth factor 2 (encoded by FGF2) and vascular endothelial growth factor. Hormone deficiencies caused by endocrine organ failure or ablation of the thyroid gland, gonads or, rarely, adrenal glands releases pituitary cells from growth restraint by removal of tonic inhibition of pituitary cell growth. For example, longstanding primary hypothyroidism may lead to thyrotroph hyperplasia because low thyroid hormone levels release restraining effects on thyrotroph proliferation.

## Pituitary tumors

Pituitary tumors are monoclonal benign adenomas, rather than hyperplastic growths, which suggests that

Key points

- Pituitary cell growth and hormone synthesis are controlled by hypothalamic, intrapituitary and peripheral factors
- Pituitary tumors arising from differentiated hormone-expressing cells are commonly encountered and are invariably benign
- Adenomas may secrete one or more hormones including prolactin, growth hormone, adrenocorticotropic hormone, glycoprotein gonadotroph subunits or hormones, or TSH; most are nonsecreting with no obvious peripheral clinical phenotype
- The pathogenic mechanisms that underlie pituitary tumorigenesis may be genetic or epigenetic and result in cell cycle dysregulation, signaling defects or loss of tumor suppressor factors

overlapping but downstream of a nestin expressing stem cell population.¹⁸

Pituitary adenomas constitute up to 15% of intracranial neoplasms, and have an overall population prevalence of ~80–90 per 100,000 of the population.¹⁹⁻²¹ These monoclonal adenomas secrete specific hormones reflective of their differentiated cell of origin (Table 1).²²,²³ Prolactinomas, which secrete prolactin, cause hypogonadism and galactorrhea. GH-secreting somatotropinomas cause gigantism and acromegaly, ACTH-secreting corticotroph tumors result in Cushing disease, and TSH-secreting thyrotroph tumors arise from thyrotrophs and cause hyperthyroidism. Gonadotroph cells can also give rise to tumors but few secrete intact luteinizing hormone or follicle-stimulating hormone and most are nonfunctioning (that is, they do not secrete hormone), and tumors derived from gonadotroph cells also include null cell adenomas or oncocytomas. These gonadotroph-derived tumors are usually discovered incidentally, or patients may present with pituitary failure or local central features of mass expansion.¹ Tumors arising from fully differentiated corticotroph or somatotroph cells may, nevertheless, also be silent and do not hypersecrete either GH or ACTH. Particularly aggressive but clinically silent ACTH-expressing adenomas may arise from the cortico-gonadotroph cell lineage.²⁴ This Review will preclude discussion of other pituitary tumor types including craniopharyngiomas and chordomas.

Pituitary tumorigenesis

The study of human pituitary tumor pathogenesis has been challenged by several limitations including the

they in fact arise from expansion of single precursor cells that possess a unique proliferative advantage.¹⁵ Several lines of evidence point to a source of pituitary progenitor cells that may give rise to pituitary adenomas. In the postnatal murine pituitary gland, early progenitor cells that exhibit stem cell characteristics may ultimately differentiate into hormone-synthesizing pituitary cells.¹⁶,¹⁷ As yet, it is unclear whether determination of adult postnatal pituitary progenitor cells is controlled similarly to the cascade of embryonic pituitary development. Ultimately, adenomas probably arise from either early progenitor or fully differentiated hormone-expressing cells. The role of pituitary progenitor cells exhibiting stem cell features in adenoma cytogenesis has been underscored by the findings of Hosoyama *et al.*¹⁸ In a mouse model, a pituitary cell lineage expressing the Pax7 transcription factor gave rise to pituitary tumors, and this cell lineage was

inaccessibility of the gland for biopsy material, lack of functional hormone-secreting human pituitary cell lines and few faithful animal models that recapitulate hormone-secreting or nonfunctional human pituitary tumor phenotypes.²⁵

Specific tumor-initiating and tumor-promoting factors have been characterized in animal models, as well as in limited human tissue samples. These factors have been shown to confer increased proliferative potential to the precursor cell for adenoma formation and subsequent tumor growth, and include genetic or epigenetic abnormalities, paracrine growth factor disruptions and an altered intrapituitary microenvironment (Box 1). These factors may be associated with pituitary-selective oncogene activation or tumor suppressor gene inactivation, or pituitary cell cycle dysregulation, all of which contribute to sustained cell proliferation.²⁶ The primary initiating cause for these events remains elusive, although several transgenic mouse models have demonstrated that both inactivated²⁷,²⁸ or overexpressed cell cycle regulators are sufficient to initiate pituitary tumorigenesis (Figure 1).²⁹ Classic oncogene mutations are rarely encountered in pituitary tumors.³⁰ Nevertheless, a large body of work³¹ has uncovered a considerable number of pituitary-specific cellular disruptions (Table 2), which are highlighted below.

### Signaling mechanisms

Several studies have profiled heterogeneous gene expression patterns in pituitary adenomas,³²,³³ yet uniform molecular signature patterns for tumor aggression have yet to be clarified. Signaling pathway networks associated with pituitary adenoma formation have also been elucidated by focused mining of proteomic expression data obtained from normal human pituitary tissue versus adenoma tissue. These pathways include those involved in mitochondrial function, oxidative stress, mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling and cell cycle regulation.³⁴ Further elucidation of these adenoma-associated networks should result in an integrated understanding of pituitary adenoma pathogenesis and pathophysiologic functions.³⁵

The underlying pathophysiology of pituitary tumorigenesis is characterized by a combination of disordered cell proliferation coupled with dysregulated hormone hypersecretion. Figure 2 depicts an overview of intracellular pituitary tumor cell signaling associated with both cell proliferation and hormone synthesis.

### Cell cycle regulation

Complex control of the various phases of the cell cycle is regulated by cyclins that stimulate cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). When activated, these kinases phosphorylate and inactivate a key negative regulator of the cell cycle—retinoblastoma-associated protein (Rb), which is a tumor suppressor protein. The active, hypophosphorylated form of Rb binds to E2F transcription factors, which restrains cell cycle progression through the G1 to S phase (the synthesis phase in which DNA is replicated). This function of Rb acts to prevent damaged DNA being replicated. By contrast, when phosphorylation is

induced by complexes of cyclin and CDKs, Rb releases bound E2F transcription factors, which enables cell cycle progression.³⁶

Although cyclins are overexpressed in nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas,³³ the associated mechanism for pituitary cell cycle dysregulation remains obscure. Mice with heterozygous inactivation of *Rb1* (the gene that encodes Rb), develop highly penetrant pituitary tumors,²⁷ while those with deregulated E2F transcription factors in the pituitary gland develop pituitary hyperplasia without progression to tumor formation, owing to premature cell senescence.³⁷ Although Rb is expressed in most nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas, approximately 25% of GH-secreting adenomas show hypermethylation of the Rb gene promoter with associated loss of expression.³⁸

Two families of CDK inhibitors—the INK4a/ARF (p16, p15, p18) and cip/kip inhibitors (p21, p27, p57)—normally act as tumor suppressors by negatively regulating progression through the G1 and S phases of the cell cycle. These proteins inhibit CDK kinase activity, thereby, preventing phosphorylation and inactivation of pRb. For example, the gene that encodes p16, which normally inhibits Rb phosphorylation and inactivation by CDK4, was hypermethylated and transcriptionally silent in a number of pituitary tumor biopsies analysed.³⁹ In mice, deletion of p18 leads to gigantism, organomegaly, and pituitary

intermediate lobe hyperplasia and adenomas; p18 protein levels are also attenuated in human adenomas.⁴⁰

In a mouse model, disruption of the gene that encodes p27 results in mice with increased body weight, organ hyperplasia and intermediate pituitary lobe tumors.²⁸ Furthermore, loss of p27 cooperates with overexpression of cyclin E to facilitate corticotroph tumorigenesis.⁴¹ Increased proliferation is thought to occur because overexpression of corticotroph cyclin E levels leads to abnormal re-entry into the cell cycle of differentiated cells in an environment in which the cell cycle inhibitor p27 is lost.

Glucocorticoid resistance of corticotroph tumor cells is pathognomonic of Cushing disease.⁴² The failure of glucocorticoids to suppress proopiomelanocortin (POMC) gene expression leads to persistent ACTH synthesis and hypersecretion. The transcription activator Brg1, which is the catalytic subunit of the SW1/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, normally functions to enable POMC repression, and in ACTH-secreting adenomas loss of Brg1 contributes to corticotroph glucocorticoid resistance.⁴³ In most corticotroph tumors and in pituitary carcinomas, both p27 and Brg1 levels are low or undetectable.⁴¹,⁴³ Dysfunction of p27 in pituitary tumorigenesis may be due to a problem with the translation of the protein. Indeed, a mutation in DKC1, which encodes a translational regulator of mRNAs with internal ribosomal entry site elements, was found to be associated with altered p27 expression in a human pituitary adenoma.⁴⁴ Another cell cycle regulator, encoded by pituitary tumor transforming gene 1 (PTTG1), controls faithful separation of sister chromatids. Pttg was isolated from rat pituitary tumor cells by differential RNA display with normal pituitary glands, and is also induced by the E2F transcription factor in the pituitary gland.⁴⁵,⁴⁶ Pttgl is a mammalian securin (a pro-angiogenic pituitary factor),⁴⁷ and overexpression causes cell transformation

Figure 2 | Intracellular signaling associated with pituitary cell proliferation and transformation. Transcription of hormone genes in a differentiated cell and cell proliferation are mostly induced by pituitary mitogenic factors including hypothalamic hormones and transcription factors, as well as endocrine hormones. Pituitary proliferative constraints include somatotrophin release-inhibiting factor and tumor suppressor genes. Cell cycle progression through G1 to S phase is mediated by CDK–cyclin complexes that phosphorylate Rb and cause it to release E2F, which drives cell proliferation. CDK inhibitors block kinase phosphorylation, thereby restraining the cell cycle. Chromosomal instability, DNA damage and senescence may act to constrain malignant transformation of pituitary tumors.

**in vitro**, ${}^{48,49}$ and expression of this regulator is induced during initiation of estrogen-induced pituitary tumor formation. ${}^{13}$ Pituitary-directed *Pttg1* overexpression in transgenic mice results in focal pituitary hyperplasia and adenoma formation. ${}^{29}$ Maintenance of chromosomal stability requires tight control of intracellular cell-cycle dependent PTTG1 levels, ${}^{50}$ as either *Pttgl* overexpression or disruption result in dysregulated G2 to M phase cell cycling, aneuploidy and chromosomal instability *in vitro* and in transgenic mouse models. ${}^{51,52}$

### Defective signaling pathways

The G protein α (Ga) subunit, encoded by *GNAS*, is a key component of signal transduction pathways. ${}^{53,54}$ For example, this factor activates adenylate cyclase, which induces the cyclic AMP (cAMP) and protein kinase A signaling pathway. The GTPase function of the Ga subunit is inactivated by *gsp* mutations of *GNAS* including amino acid substitutions at Arg201 or Gln227. These mutations are present in ~30% of GH-secreting adenomas, and they result in elevated somatotroph cAMP levels and hypersecretion of GH. ${}^{55}$ Thus, constitutively induced somatotroph proliferation and GH secretion may occur independently of GH releasing hormone, and also may be associated with activation of downstream signaling factors including cAMP-response element binding factor activation. ${}^{56}$

Early postzygotic *gsp* mutations may give rise to an endocrine hypersecretory syndrome (McCune–Albright), which includes pigmented skin lesions, precocious puberty, hyperthyroidism, acromegaly and/or Cushing syndrome with bony fibrous dysplasia. This syndrome is associated with chromosome 20q13.2 mosaicism (variable expression of the mutation in different cells) which results in constitutively active Ga subunit and cAMP activation. Patients with McCune–Albright syndrome usually exhibit selective pituitary hyperplasia, rather than focal adenomas. ${}^{57}$ Furthermore, an acquired *gsp* mutation has been described in the transition of an aggressive prolactinoma to a GH-secreting adenoma. ${}^{58}$ Thus, cAMP is probably a common intracellular pathway for pituitary tumorigenesis in a subset of patients.

Several growth factors and their cognate receptors, including selective members of the fibroblast growth factor, ${}^{59}$ epidermal growth factor, ${}^{60,61}$ nerve growth factor, ${}^{62}$ bone morphogenetic protein ${}^{63}$ and vascular endothelial growth factor ${}^{64}$ families and Akt signaling pathways, ${}^{65}$ have been implicated in the pituitary tumorigenic cascade. Wnt pathway inhibitors are also differentially expressed in pituitary adenomas versus normal pituitary tissue. ${}^{66,67}$

Studies in estrogen receptor β null mice have highlighted the requirement of estrogen receptor α for gonadotroph-cell adenoma development.⁶⁸ In fact, estrogen receptor α seems to be more abundantly expressed in large than small pituitary tumors.⁶⁹ Fibroblast growth factor receptor variants⁷⁰ may underlie disrupted chromatin access and interfere with cell adhesion molecules in pituitary adenomas.⁷¹ Bone morphogenetic protein 4, which normally acts as a suppressor of corticotroph tumor growth, is actually abundantly expressed in prolactinomas.⁷² Disruption of other signaling molecules associated with pituitary tumorigenesis include transforming growth factor β³⁷³ and gp130 cytokines.⁷⁴,⁷⁵

### Transcriptional regulators

In transgenic mice, overexpression of an HMGA2 protein results in both GH-secreting and prolactin-secreting pituitary tumor formation,⁷⁶,⁷⁷ which appears to be mediated by enhanced E2F action.⁷⁷,⁷⁸ In humans, re-arrangement and amplification of the HMGA2 gene expression seems to occur predominantly in prolactinomas, and HMGA2 mRNA abundance correlates with pituitary tumor size and proliferation markers.⁷⁷ These tumor growth effects may result from CCNB2 promoter induction, resulting in enhanced cyclin B2 levels and subsequent activation of the E2F transcription factor.⁷⁹

Expression of several putative pituitary-selective tumor suppressor genes have been shown to be lost or downregulated in adenomas versus normal pituitary tissue. Several of these factors are inactivated by epigenetic mechanisms,⁸⁰ and include Runt-related transcription factor 1,⁸⁰ which upregulates galectin-3, a pituitary tumor marker.⁸¹ Expression of zinc finger protein PLAGL1, a transcriptional coregulator, appears to be lost in a subset of pituitary tumors⁸² and somatostatin analogs may in fact mediate antiproliferative actions through PLAGL1.⁸³ GADD45-γ and maternally imprinted MEG3 have been identified as pituitary-derived suppressor genes, and are silenced by methylation mechanisms especially in nonfunctioning pituitary tumors.⁸⁴,⁸⁵ A dominant negative isoform of DNA-binding protein Ikaros is present in almost half of all pituitary adenomas and this molecule has been shown to regulate pituitary tumor cell chromatin remodeling and cell survival.⁸⁶ Ikaros also activates the POMC promoter and may serve as a systemic integrator of hypothalamic–pituitary signaling.⁸⁷ Neuronatin is abundantly expressed in nontumorous, hormone-secreting pituitary cells, but is not detected in adenomas, due to tumor-associated promoter hypermethylation, which indicates that this protein protects against tumor formation.⁸⁸

### Pituitary tumor microRNAs

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are noncoding short RNAs that act post-transcriptionally to regulate gene expression, mRNA translation and degradation.⁸⁹ Although these molecules target both activating oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, their direct role in pituitary tumorigenesis has not yet been clarified. Expression of several miRNAs, as assessed by real time PCR, is downregulated in ACTH-secreting pituitary tumors, including miR145, miR21, miR15 and miR16,⁹⁰ while miR122 and miR493 are upregulated in ACTH-expressing carcinomas.⁹¹,⁹² Suppression of let-7 miRNA family members, as well as of miR15a/miR16, are conserved across most pituitary tumor subtypes. In nonfunctioning and in GH-secreting adenomas, Wee1-like protein kinase, which acts as a tumor suppressor protein, was shown to be regulated by miR128a, miR155 and miR516a-3p.⁹³ Clearly, pituitary tumor miRNAs are an emerging focus of pituitary tumor research.

### Pituitary adenoma syndromes

Most pituitary tumors are sporadic but some arise as components of familial tumor syndromes.⁹⁴

#### Multiple endocrine neoplasia type I

Multiple endocrine neoplasia type I is an autosomal dominant syndrome with high penetrance that is caused by one of hundreds of inactivating *MEN1* mutations. The syndrome leads to selective development of neuroendocrine neoplasias in parathyroid, pancreatic and pituitary glands.⁹⁴,⁹⁵ The pituitary tumors may include prolactinomas, acromegaly, Cushing syndrome or very rarely, TSH-secreting adenomas.

#### Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 4

A p27 germline mutation has been identified⁹⁶,⁹⁷ in rare patients with MEN-1-like features but an intact *MEN1* gene; these patients have multiple endocrine neoplasia type 4. This syndrome may involve both acromegaly and Cushing disease.⁹⁸ Evidence suggests that p27 is a tissue-specific target for both the tumor suppressor menin and RET proto-oncogene-mediated cell proliferative signaling.⁹⁹ As increasing numbers of CDK inhibitor mutations are being identified, correlative clinical phenotypes of these syndromes will become clarified in the future.¹⁰⁰

#### Carney syndrome

This autosomal dominant disorder is caused by activated protein kinase A activity, due largely to a *PRKAR1A* mutation on chromosome 17q22-24, and comprises spotty skin pigmentation, myxomas, and testicular, adrenal and/or pituitary adenomas or hyperplasia.¹⁰¹ Pituitary-selective deletion of *Prkar1a* in mice results in POU1F1-lineage pituitary tumors, recapitulating the clinical syndrome.¹⁰²

#### Familial isolated pituitary adenoma

Affected persons with this rare syndrome may have several pituitary types. Those with acromegaly or gigantism exhibit loss of heterozygosity at an 11q13 chromosomal locus distinct from that of MENI.¹⁰³ Inactivating germline mutations in the *AIP* gene predispose to pituitary adenomas in a subset of these patients.¹⁰⁴,¹⁰⁵ Overall, about one third of families with familial acromegaly appear to harbor a germline *AIP* mutation. Tumors associated with *AIP* mutations are large and generally diagnosed by the age of 25 years and hence patients present with gigantism.¹⁰⁴–¹⁰⁸

Several mechanisms have been proposed to underlie these genetic observations. The AIP protein may behave as a tumor suppressor and function to regulate cell responses to dioxin, and when mutated, may also disrupt cAMP signaling. AIP also interacts with RET, preventing cell availability of survivin—an inhibitor of apoptosis. ${ }^{109}$ All transgenic mice with heterogeneously inactivated *Aip* develop pituitary adenomas, in particular GH-secreting tumors, by 15 months of age. ${ }^{110}$ The hypoxia response in these mutant adenomas is activated, as evidenced by expression of pituitary hypoxia-inducible factor 1α and undetectable expression of several aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocators (ARNTs), possibly contributing to angiogenesis and cell proliferation. ${ }^{110}$ In mutant human pituitary adenomas, ARNT proteins are similarly reduced. ${ }^{111}$ To date, *AIP* mutations appear to be largely restricted to familial tumor forms and are not readily apparent in sporadic pituitary tumors. In families with known *AIP* mutations, the penetrance of pituitary tumors is about 30%. ${ }^{112}$

### Why are pituitary tumors benign?

Pituitary chromosome instability, aneuploidy and epigenetic changes, including methylation of the p16 gene promoter, are early events in the pathogenesis of pituitary tumors. ${ }^{113,114}$ Nevertheless, pituitary tumors rarely progress to become true metastatic carcinomas, despite a minority of adenomas that exhibit aggressive, invasive or recurrent growth. However, mitotic activity is relatively low relative to other tumor types, even in the case of highly invasive adenomas.

Mechanisms underlying the unique indolent growth of these invariably benign adenomas remain obscure, as common cancer-associated oncogene mutations are rarely observed. ${ }^{31}$ Pituitary adenomas, especially clinically inactive microadenomas, exhibit stable growth often during decades of observation, while some prolactinomas may even resolve. ${ }^{2}$ These observations support the notion that trophic properties of highly specialized hormone-secreting pituitary cells include intrinsic restraint of uncontrolled proliferation.

Mechanisms leading to cessation of pituitary tumor cell proliferation include G1 cell cycle arrest associated with DNA damage and p53-mediated induction of the CDK inhibitor p21 that blocks Rb phosphorylation. ${ }^{115-117}$ Premature proliferative arrest or cell senescence occurs in slow growing benign or early stage tumors, but not in late stage or malignant tumors. These processes may be induced by activated oncoproteins, with an initial burst of cell proliferation followed by DNA damage and replication stress. ${ }^{118,119}$ This senescence process has been observed in pituitary tumors, whereby overexpression of pituitary tumor-transforming gene 1, ${ }^{120}$ which is initially permissive for pituitary tumor formation, ${ }^{29,121,122}$ subsequently leads to defective DNA replication and aneuploidy. ${ }^{123}$

In transgenic mice, inducible pituitary E2F transcription factor 3 activity leads to hyperplasia, and ultimately to irreversible cell cycle arrest with features of pituitary senescence. ${ }^{37}$ Human GH-secreting and prolactin-secreting adenomas exhibit features of senescence, including

expression of p21, whereas intranuclear p21 is undetectable in pituitary carcinomas. ${ }^{124}$ Other observed hallmarks of pituitary tumor senescence include increased activity of senescence associated-β-galactosidase, chromosome condensation into distinct heterochromatic foci and Rb hypophosphorylation. ${ }^{124}$ Thus, premature pituitary tumor cell senescence appears to bypass pro-proliferative signals, thereby dampening cell proliferation, while preserving vital homeostatic pituitary functions from malignant destruction in order to maintain cell viability.

#### Future perspectives

Several promising lines of research will provide insights into the pathogenesis and treatments of pituitary adenomas. Characterization of specific tumor-associated growth factors, signaling pathways and cell cycle checkpoint disruptions has proved valuable in elucidating novel targeted pituitary tumor therapies, as exemplified by tyrosine kinase inhibitors. ${ }^{125}$ For example, lapatinib, a dual ErbB (epidermal growth factor receptor) family tyrosine kinase inhibitor suppresses rat prolactinoma secretion *in vivo*, and human prolactinoma secretion *in vitro*, providing a rationale for clinical trial design. An important therapeutic decision is often required after surgical resection of both functioning and nonfunctioning adenomas, in terms of whether persistent or recurrent disease requires additional therapy or if no further treatment is indicated. Currently, these decisions are based largely on retrospective experience. Notably, the emergence of credible cell markers that predict pituitary tumor drug responsiveness will enable evidence-based prospective treatment decisions. ${ }^{83,126}$ Ideally, the availability of unique signature patterns of tumor gene expression will facilitate future personalized approaches to pituitary tumor therapy.

#### Conclusions

To what extent selectively disrupted signaling pathways are initiating rather than permissive factors in pituitary tumor formation requires further study. ${ }^{127}$ Understanding mechanisms that underlie pituitary adenoma cell cycle arrest, including the role of soluble growth factors and cytokines, will shed light on the benign nature of these tumors. Further characterization of pituitary adenoma stem cells will also probably yield *in vitro* cell models with which to unravel the mechanisms that contribute to tumor resistance to dopamine agonists and somatostatin analogs. ${ }^{26}$

CORRECTION

**Pathogenesis of pituitary tumors**

Shlomo Melmed

In the version of this article initially published online, there was an error in the penultimate sentence of page 4. This sentence should have read ‘Pttg was isolated from rat pituitary tumor cells by differential RNA display with normal pituitary glands, and is also induced by the E2F transcription factor in the pituitary gland.’ The error has been corrected for the print, HTML and PDF versions of the article.
