Once a T cell detects signs of foreign antigens on an antigen-presenting cell, it establishes a tight contact that results in the formation of an immunological synapse and T-cell activation. Although it has long been appreciated that remodelling of the actin cytoskeleton is an integral part of T-cell receptor (TCR) signalling and T-cell activation, the mechanisms underlying its regulation are not entirely understood. However, recent observations have provided more insights into how TCR signalling converges on key cytoskeletal components and how these control crucial activities, such as actin filament nucleation and elongation, integrin activation, and raft and TCR clustering. Here, we analyse the implications of these findings for the understanding of actin cytoskeleton remodelling and the multifaceted aspects of T-cell biology.

T-cell activation begins when the T-cell receptor (TCR) encounters the MHC, which is expressed on specialized immune cells named antigen-presenting cells (APCs). This association results in the formation of molecular clusters that occupy the central part of a discrete structure defined as the immune or immunological synapse (IS) (reviewed in Ref. [1]). Other than being enriched in TCR and MHC molecules, this central zone, also known as the central supramolecular activation cluster (c-SMAC), harbours accessory receptors including CD4 and CD28; by contrast, the membrane proteins leukocyte function-associated antigen 1 (LFA)-1 and intercellular adhesion molecules (ICAMs) and the cytoskeletal proteins talin and moesin are confined to the surrounding zone, known as the peripheral-SMAC (p-SMAC) [2,3]. The early signalling events that follow the engagement of the TCR include a few key events, such as tyrosine phosphorylation of the TCR by Src protein tyrosine kinases (reviewed in Refs [4,5]), the recruitment and activation of the non-receptor tyrosine kinases ZAP-70 (ζ-associated protein of 70 kDa) and Fyn, and the phosphorylation of several adaptor proteins, such as LAT (linker for activation of T cells) and SLP-76 [Src homology 2 (SH2) domain-containing leukocyte protein of 76 kDa]. Finally, LAT and SLP-76 then recruit to the TCR additional proteins, such as the Fyn-binding protein (Fyb)/SLAP-130 (SLP-76-associated protein of

130 kDa), Nck, Grb2, phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ) and Vav (reviewed in Refs [6–10]).

At the microscopic level, the interaction of a T cell with an APC is characterized by the polarization of the T cell towards the APC and the concomitant formation of actin-rich lamellipodia-like plasma membrane extensions, which progressively encase the APC. The formation of these lamellipodial extensions, together with the observation that the inhibition of actin polymerization by cytochalasins abolishes T-cell proliferation, TCR clustering and Ca²⁺ flux [11,12], contributed to the notion that the remodelling of the actin cytoskeleton is essential for T-cell activation. The complexity of T-cell biology has made it difficult to pigeonhole all experimental data into a clear model for the regulation of actin cytoskeleton remodelling during T-cell activation. However, over the past few years, several studies have begun to shed light on the intricate TCR signalling pathways leading to actin cytoskeleton remodelling and have provided evidence that TCR signalling can regulate actin cytoskeleton remodelling at multiple levels during T-cell activation. Here, we will attempt to set out a few working hypotheses for the signalling pathways promoting actin cytoskeleton dynamics on TCR and CD28 engagement.

Global regulation of T-cell actin cytoskeleton dynamics

Actin cytoskeleton dynamics depend on the integration of the functions of several cytoskeletal proteins that contribute to its tightly controlled regulation by influencing the nucleation, elongation, capping, severing and crosslinking of actin filaments. For simplicity, the effect of TCR signalling on the actin cytoskeleton can be classified as global or specific. In the first case, TCR signalling affects several of the events mentioned; whereas, in the second case, this signalling pathway influences specific functions (e.g. actin filament nucleation and elongation) that regulate actin cytoskeleton remodelling.

The global regulation of actin cytoskeleton dynamics can be accomplished in various ways, all of which involve PLCγ as a central player (Figure 1). For instance, this enzyme can be recruited by LAT-dependent interactions to the TCR, where it is activated. Active PLCγ reduces the local concentration of the lipid phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate [PtdIns(4,5)P₂], which in turn can affect the activity of several cytoskeletal and actin cytoskeleton-associated proteins including profilin, cofilin and capping

a major activator of this enzyme. The increase of phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate [PtdIns(3,4,5)P₃] levels influences actin cytoskeleton remodelling by activating  
Vav, which subsequently activates Cdc42 and Rac. PtdIns(3,4,5)P₃ also affects the activity of TEC (tyrosine kinase expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma) kinases, which can  
influence actin cytoskeleton dynamics through PLCγ, Vav, Cdc42 and Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP). The activity of PI3-K also contributes to the activation of  
the phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1) and protein kinase Cs (PKCs), thus leading to the recruitment and activation of ezrin, radixin and moesin (ERM)  
proteins and myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate (MARCKS) protein, which can link the actin cytoskeleton to the plasma membrane and regulate the movement  
and clustering of membrane receptors including TCRs. Abbreviations: DG, diacylglycerol; Ins(1,4,5)P₃, inositol (1,4,5) triphosphate.

protein (reviewed in Ref. [13]). The PLCγ-driven degradation of PtdIns(4,5)P₂ can also lead to an increase in cytosolic free Ca²⁺ that, in turn, can influence the activity of some protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms (reviewed in Ref. [14]) and cytoskeletal proteins, such as gelsolin, thus resulting in actin cytoskeleton remodelling at the IS. Moreover, PLCγ can also be recruited (and activated) to the TCR in a SLP-76-dependent manner [15], again influencing the function of several cytoskeletal proteins.

Global changes in actin cytoskeleton dynamics can also be achieved by phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3-K), which phosphorylates the D-3 position of the inositol head group of PtdIns(4,5)P₂ to generate phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate [PtdIns(3,4,5)P₃]. The recruitment of PI3-K to the TCR might require its interaction with the adaptor proteins LAT and TCR-interacting molecule (TRIM) [16,17] or direct binding to the co-receptor CD28 [18], which is thought to be the major activator of this enzyme (reviewed in Ref. [19]). Apart from its ability to reduce the levels of PtdIns(4,5)P₂, PI3-K affects actin cytoskeleton dynamics primarily through the increase in the levels of PtdIns(3,4,5)P₃, which activate numerous downstream effectors that are directly or indirectly linked to the actin cytoskeleton (Figure 1). In one possible scenario, PtdIns(3,4,5)P₃ recruits Vav, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for the small GTPases Rac and Cdc42, which coordinate the formation of lamellipodia and filopodia, respectively [20]. Moreover, because the binding of PtdIns(3,4,5)P₃ to Vav promotes the tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of this GEF in vitro [21], it is possible that a similar PtdIns(3,4,5)P₃-dependent mechanism also operates in vivo.

An alternative scenario involves the TEC (tyrosine kinase expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma) family of tyrosine kinases – IL-2-induced T-cell kinase (Itk), TEC and Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (Btk), which bind to PtdIns(3,4,5)P₃ by their pleckstrin homology (PH) domains and are required for actin remodelling at the IS [22]. In addition, T cells from Itk⁻/⁻ mice have deficiencies in actin cytoskeleton remodelling similar to those of Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP)⁻/⁻ or Vav⁻/⁻ T cells, and TEC kinases interact with both proteins in vitro (reviewed in Refs [23,24–26]), suggesting that TEC kinases might regulate actin cytoskeleton remodelling by influencing WASP and Vav activities and their downstream effectors. A recent study supports this possibility by showing that TEC kinases are required for the activation of Cdc42 and WASP, as well as the recruitment of Vav at the IS [22]. Finally, TEC kinases might broadly affect actin cytoskeleton remodelling by impinging on the function of PKCs and their downstream effectors, ezrin, radixin and moesin (ERM) proteins and myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate (MARCKS) protein (reviewed in Refs [27,28]), which link the plasma membrane to the actin cytoskeleton. In this context, ERM proteins might modulate TCR signalling by affecting the movement and clustering of the TCR and other membrane proteins (see later).

Regulation and coupling of actin filament nucleation and elongation at the IS

Other than influencing actin cytoskeleton remodelling globally, TCR signals can also affect specific mechanisms leading to the regulation of actin filament nucleation and elongation at the IS. Studies on the actin-based motility of *Listeria monocytogenes* have been instrumental in defining the Arp2/3 complex as one of the major cellular factors responsible for actin filament nucleation ([29]; reviewed in Ref. [30]). The Arp2/3 complex per se has a limited actin-nucleating activity and requires interaction with other cellular factors to be fully functional (reviewed in Ref. [31]). One such factor is the WASP family of proteins. WASP, the member of this family that is exclusively expressed in haematopoietic lineages, co-localizes with actin and the Arp2/3 complex at the IS [32], and mutations in the gene encoding WASP result in alterations in microvilli and in abnormal actin cytoskeleton dynamics in response to receptor ligation [23], suggesting that the function of this protein is crucial for actin cytoskeleton dynamics. Biochemical studies have highlighted one potential mechanism for WASP function in this process that consists of its interaction with actin monomers and the Arp2/3 complex and results in the stimulation of Arp2/3 complex-driven actin filament nucleation (reviewed in Ref. [33]).

But how is the TCR signalling cascade linked to actin filament nucleation? A few scenarios can be envisaged (Figure 2). For example, WASP could be recruited to the TCR through association with the C-terminal SH3 domain of Nck [34] and SLP-76. By virtue of these interactions, WASP would be placed in proximity to Rho-family GTPases that, on activation by the SLP-76 ligand Vav, would become competent to activate WASP, thus leading to Arp2/3 complex-evoked actin polymerization. Because WASP can be activated (and perhaps recruited to the TCR) by PtdIns(4,5)P₂ and the adaptor protein Grb2 in vitro [35,36], similar mechanisms might also operate in vivo. The finding that WASP-interacting protein (WIP) is essential for actin cytoskeleton remodelling on TCR activation [37] suggests that WIP might be involved in WASP recruitment. This notion is supported by the observation that WASP can be recruited to the TCR by a complex including WIP, ZAP-70 and the adaptor CRKL, and that WIP interacts with the adaptor protein Nck [38,39]. Moreover, because WIP can synergize with Vav during T-cell activation [40], it is conceivable that WIP also contributes to WASP activation. Another mechanism for WASP recruitment to the IS is suggested by the observation that, following TCR engagement, it associates with the proline, serine, threonine phosphatase-interacting protein 1 (PSTPIP1), a ligand of the CD2 co-receptor [41]. Moreover, because CD2-driven actin cytoskeleton remodelling is impaired in WASP⁻/⁻ cells [41] and CD2 has been involved in actin cytoskeleton polarization at the T-cell–APC interface [42], WASP appears to relay signals from both the TCR and CD2 receptors to the actin cytoskeleton. Interestingly, CD2 and its ligand CD2-associated protein (CD2AP) [42] might directly affect actin cytoskeleton dynamics by binding to the capping protein CAPZ [43] and to c-Cbl [44], an adaptor protein also implicated in the regulation of actin cytoskeleton dynamics (reviewed in Ref. [45]). The role of WASP in actin filament nucleation might also be controlled by its phosphorylation state, as suggested by the observation that Itk is required for Cdc42 and WASP activation as well as for Vav recruitment to the

Figure 2. Regulation of actin cytoskeleton dynamics by TCR and CD28 signalling pathways. (a) TCR-driven actin filament nucleation follows the recruitment and activation of several kinases and adaptor proteins. One of these, WASP, can be involved in TCR signalling through its association with Nck or Vav. WASP can also be recruited to the TCR through the complex formed by WIP, ZAP-70 and the adaptor protein CRKL, or through the binding to the co-receptor CD2, mediated by the adaptor protein PSTPIP1. The function of WASP might be affected by its interaction with Grb2 and PtdIns(4,5)P₂ and by its phosphorylation through IL-2-induced T-cell kinase (Itk), which can also participate in Cdc42 activation and Vav targeting to the TCR (light blue and orange arrows). Actin filament nucleation can also be mediated by the haematopoietic-specific protein 1 (HS1), which can bind and activate the Arp2/3 complex. The association of Fyb/SLAP-130 with Ena/VASP proteins can support actin filament elongation by the recruitment of profilin–actin to the TCR. This process might also take place through the direct interaction of Ena/VASP proteins with WASP. Fyb/SLAP-130 is also involved
IS [22]. Indeed, the phosphorylation of either tyrosine or serine residues within WASP enhances its ability to interact with the Arp2/3 complex and induce actin polymerization in vitro as well as in vivo [46, 47]. In this context, Badour *et al.* [48] have recently demonstrated that the interplay between the protein tyrosine kinase Fyn and the protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) PEST regulates the phosphorylation state of a tyrosine residue that is crucial for WASP function in TCR signalling. These findings, together with the observation that the interaction of WASP with Cdc42 is not required for the activity of WASP in TCR-induced T-cell proliferation and actin polymerisation, provide new insights into both the regulation of WASP function and actin cytoskeleton dynamics.

A more direct link to actin filament nucleation is provided by the haematopoietic-specific protein 1 (HS1), a substrate for Src protein tyrosine kinases, such as Lck [49]. HS1 can bind actin filaments and also activates the Arp2/3 complex [50], thus providing a direct link between early TCR signalling (activation of Src kinases) and actin filament nucleation. Finally, it should be pointed out that, although the Arp2/3 complex can be activated by WASP, N-WASP, Scar/WAVE (also expressed in haematopoietic cells) (reviewed in Ref. [51]) and HS1, the alteration of WASP function alone inhibits TCR-dependent actin cytoskeleton remodelling. This indicates that the other activators of the Arp2/3 complex play little, if any, role in this process.

Although the Arp2/3 complex efficiently supports actin filament nucleation at the nascent IS, it is unable to sustain rapid actin filament elongation, suggesting that other factors are required for this process. The analysis of *Listeria* motility and other actin-based processes has demonstrated that proteins of the Ena/VASP (vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein) family are crucial for efficient actin filament elongation (reviewed in Refs [52–54]). Ena/VASP proteins co-localize with actin and Fyb/SLAP-130 at the IS and their displacement from this site severely impairs actin cytoskeleton remodelling [32], suggesting that they are crucial for IS formation. Through their interaction with Fyb/SLAP-130, and based on their binding to profilin [55], Ena/VASP proteins might be targeted to upstream components of the TCR signalling pathway and regulate actin filament elongation by recruiting profilin–actin complexes (Figure 2). In addition, because Ena/VASP proteins can interact with the proline-rich region of WASP [56], it is conceivable that they are recruited to the IS through this association. Interestingly, Fyb/SLAP-130 is not required for actin cytoskeleton remodelling following long-lasting stimulation of the

TCR [57, 58]. Because these studies did not analyse the events leading to actin cytoskeleton remodelling in detail, it is not possible to exclude *a priori* the possibility that Fyb/SLAP-130 contributes to this process. Fyb/SLAP-130, also known as ADAP (for ‘adhesion- and degranulation-promoting adaptor protein’), is essential for TCR-mediated activation of LFA-1 integrin and enhancement of cell adhesion [57, 58]. Because LFA-1 is required for T-cell activation [59] and integrin clustering depends on its association with actin cytoskeleton components [60], Fyb/SLAP-130 might regulate T-cell activation through actin cytoskeleton-driven changes in LFA-1 orientation. In this respect, LFA-1 can also be activated by RAPL (regulator for cell adhesion and polarization enriched in lymphoid tissues) [61], a ligand for the small GTPase Rap1, which has been implicated in cell polarization and motility [62]. This suggests an interplay between Fyb/ SLAP-130 and RAPL in the regulation of LFA-1 function and actin cytoskeleton remodelling. This mechanism might function independently or in conjunction with cytohesin-1, a cytoplasmic regulatory protein that modulates LFA-1 activity [63].

Overall, these findings indicate that Ena/VASP proteins and the Arp2/3 complex are crucial for actin filament nucleation and elongation at the IS. How do T cells coordinate these functions during T-cell activation? On the basis of the observation that TCR engagement results in the formation of a multi-molecular complex including SLP-76, Fyb/SLAP-130, Nck and WASP [32], it is possible that SLP-76 might be engaged in interactions that form two molecular axes, one connected to the efficient supply of actin monomers and one connected to the nucleation of actin filaments. Together, these axes would permit the spatial and temporal control of actin remodelling, directly promoting the formation of the immunological synapse (Figure 2). Accordingly, a similar multi-molecular complex forms during Fcγ receptor-mediated phagocytosis [64], suggesting that the assembly of such complexes is a general mechanism underlying actin cytoskeleton dynamics in haematopoietic cells.

### CD28-dependent regulation of actin cytoskeleton remodelling

The two-signal hypothesis for T-cell activation states that optimal T-cell function is determined by two concomitant signals: one from the TCR and the other from a costimulatory receptor. Among the known co-receptors, CD28 seems to play a crucial role in enhancing cytokine production and preventing unresponsiveness in T cells (reviewed in Refs [65, 66]). However, despite its central function in this process, little is known about the

in the regulation of the function of the integrin leukocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1). (b) CD28-dependent actin cytoskeleton remodelling. CD28 signalling might affect the Arp2/3 complex-mediated actin cytoskeleton remodelling through its association with Vav and the subsequent activation of Cdc42, Rac and WASP. The PI3-K-dependent generation of Ptdlns(3,4,5)P₃ might also affect the function of Vav, TEC kinases and WASP. In addition, CD28 can interact with Grb2, thus leading to the recruitment of SLP-76, Nck and, finally, WASP. Vav function and Cdc42 (Rac) activity might also be influenced by WIP and Lck. CD28 signalling might lead to the regulation of membrane-cytoskeleton association through the signalling cascade involving PDK1, PKCs, ERM proteins and MARCKS protein.

molecular basis of CD28 signalling and its relationship to actin cytoskeleton remodelling. Emerging clues indicate that CD28 affects actin cytoskeleton remodelling by engaging signalling components common to the TCR signalling pathway. Specifically, CD28 ligation and subsequent tyrosine phosphorylation causes the recruitment of PI3-K to this receptor [18], which, as already elaborated, can lead to a global remodelling of the actin cytoskeleton (Figure 2). In addition, active CD28 can associate with Grb2 and contribute to the phosphorylation of Vav [67,68], thus potentially leading to the recruitment of SLP-76 (reviewed in Ref. [7]) and the recruitment and activation of the small GTPase Rac. CD28 can also associate with and activate Lck and TEC kinases (reviewed in Ref. [69]) and regulate WASP function (see earlier) and actin filament nucleation through the Arp2/3 complex. Because CD28 costimulation does not correct defective activation of WIP−/− T cells [37], we speculate that WIP could be implicated in CD28-dependent actin cytoskeleton remodelling, perhaps through its synergy with Vav. In contrast to the TCR, CD28 engagement does not result in the activation of ZAP-70 [70]. This might result in hypo-phosphorylation of Fyb/SLAP-130 and in the alteration of the interaction between Fyb/SLAP-130 and SLP-76, a possibility consistent with the observation that co-transfection of SLP-76 and Fyb/SLAP-130 does not augment CD28 signalling [71]. As a consequence, both the Fyb/SLAP-130-dependent targeting of Ena/VASP proteins (with subsequent enhancement of actin filament elongation) and the formation of a multi-molecular complex including SLP-76, Fyb/SLAP-130, Nck and WASP (with the integration of Ena/VASP and

Arp2/3 complex activities) might not take place following CD28 engagement. Thus, CD28 signalling appears mostly to affect actin filament nucleation, which might contribute to priming the TCR signalling cascade, reinforcing the amplitude and duration of the TCR signal, or both.

Regulation of TCR and raft clustering by membrane-cytoskeleton interactions

The formation of the IS and the subsequent T-cell activation require the spatial organization of various receptors and signalling components in discrete regions of the plasma membrane termed lipid rafts, which are rich in cholesterol and sphingomyelin (reviewed in Refs [72,73]). Although it has been appreciated that the actin cytoskeleton is involved in the segregation of signalling components in lipid rafts, the mechanisms underlying its function have, so far, remained largely unknown. Recent observations have shown that TCR and raft clustering, as well as activation of Rac, are severely impaired in T cells lacking the adaptor protein DOCK2 (downstream of Crk2) [74]. Moreover, because the overexpression of DOCK2 enhances the activation of Rac2 in Jurkat cells [75] and Rac can activate WASP (see earlier), it seems plausible that WASP-evoked actin cytoskeleton changes are implicated in TCR and raft clustering (Figure 3). This conclusion is corroborated by the finding that WASP localizes to lipid rafts and also that the composition and clustering of lipid rafts is altered in WASP−/− T cells [39,76]. However, the involvement of WASP in raft function remains to be clarified as another report indicates that WASP does not localize to these plasma membrane sub-regions [41].

![Diagram](https://i.imgur.com/placeholder.png)

Figure 3. Regulation of T-cell receptor (TCR) and raft clustering by membrane-cytoskeleton interactions. In resting T cells, a trimolecular complex formed by the raft-associated Csk-binding protein (CBP), the ezrin-binding phosphoprotein EBP50 and ezrin, radixin and moesin (ERM) proteins inhibits the uncontrolled onset of TCR and raft clustering in the absence of proper stimuli, probably by anchoring crucial membrane components to the actin cytoskeleton. On TCR stimulation, this trimolecular complex is disassembled, thus leading to the release of ERM proteins and to the clustering of the TCR and rafts. The function of ERM proteins might be regulated by Lck, a protein tyrosine kinase that localizes to lipid rafts, or other protein kinases that phosphorylate Ser and Thr residues within ERM proteins (red arrow). Stimulation of TCR and raft clustering might also be triggered by a signalling cascade involving DOCK2 (downstream of Crk2) and Rac that leads to the recruitment, and possibly to the activation, of Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) and the subsequent change of actin cytoskeleton dynamics at the immunological synapse.

A more direct link between the actin cytoskeleton and the segregation of signalling components in lipid rafts has been provided by studies showing that ERM proteins localize to the IS and become phosphorylated following TCR receptor ligation [77–79]. In addition, the over-expression of the N-terminal domain of ezrin perturbs TCR clustering and the subsequent T-cell activation [77]. Thus, through their ability to associate simultaneously with membrane components and actin filaments, ERM proteins can favour TCR clustering and hence the formation of the IS. ERM proteins appear not only to sustain these processes but also to hinder them, as indicated by the observation that, in resting T cells, ERM proteins reduce the mobility of TCR and lipid rafts by forming a trimolecular complex with the ezrin-binding phospho-protein EBP-50 and the raft component Csk-binding protein (CBP) [80]. Because this trimolecular complex is disassembled following TCR stimulation [80], it is reasonable to propose that ERM proteins control TCR and raft clustering at two levels: they can prevent the uncontrolled onset of these processes in the absence of proper stimuli, as in resting T cells, yet facilitate them following suitable stimulation. Finally, the actin cytoskeleton might also affect the clustering of the co-receptor CD2 as suggested by the observation that its ligand CD2AP directly interacts with actin filaments [81].

### Concluding remarks

These findings are consistent with a model for TCR signalling involving the formation of protein complexes that relay signals to components of the actin cytoskeleton. The subsequent actin cytoskeleton remodelling is then required for supporting plasma membrane extension during T-cell–APC interaction and integrin activation and, through membrane-cytoskeleton interactions, it might also modulate T-cell activation by the regulation of TCR and lipid raft clustering. Despite this knowledge, many questions remain to be answered. For example, what are the roles of the actomyosin cytoskeleton and microtubules in IS formation and T-cell activation? Does the actin cytoskeleton have any function in the later stages of the interaction between APCs and T cells? How are CD28 and TCR signalling pathways integrated and how do the CD28-dependent actin cytoskeleton dynamics affect T-cell activation? Which specific functions can be ascribed to the plethora of adaptor proteins involved in TCR and CD28 signalling cascades? How do other co-receptors, such as CD2, affect actin cytoskeleton dynamics?

Many of the proteins involved in actin cytoskeleton remodelling assemble into TCR-driven early molecular scaffolds, which can associate subsequently with stimulatory or inhibitory molecules to promote an immunogenic or tolerogenic T-cell response, respectively (reviewed in Ref. [82]). Thus, it is conceivable that the actin cytoskeleton contributes to the formation and/or maturation of these molecular scaffolds. In addition, in light of the crucial role of the actin cytoskeleton of APCs in T-cell activation [83], future studies should also be aimed at determining the signalling cascades leading to actin cytoskeleton remodelling in APCs and how they affect signalling pathways and actin dynamics in T cells.

The answers to these questions will certainly improve our understanding of the role of the actin cytoskeleton in T-cell function. In addition, they should provide, in the near future, tools for the development of novel therapeutic strategies for controlling the immune response in autoimmune diseases and cancer, as well as for inducing long-lasting systemic tolerance in transplantation medicine.
