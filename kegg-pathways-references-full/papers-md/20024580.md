**Abstract** Studies in the last two decades have firmly established that nitric oxide (NO) exerts a broad range of effects on bodily functions including muscle contractility, platelet aggregation, metabolism, neuronal activity, and immune responses. The underlying mechanisms rely primarily on elevating guanosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate due to the stimulation of soluble guanylyl cyclase, inhibiting mitochondria respiration by the action on cytochrome C oxidase, and nitrosylating proteins and enzymes. Under pathophysiological conditions, an increased production of NO concurrently with an enhanced generation of superoxide leads to the formation of peroxynitrite, a potent oxidative agent, and thus tissue injuries. This article intends to provide a brief review on the effects of NO in the modulations of muscle contractility, platelet aggregation, metabolism, neuronal activity, and immune responses. The actions of NO vary depending on the interactions between this gaseous molecule, its derivatives, and their effectors as well as the local redox environments. Considering the complexity of these interactions and the widespread presence of NO in various body systems and cell types, there is no doubt that this area of research will remain very challenging and rewarding in the foreseeable future.

**Introduction**

Endogenous nitric oxide (NO) is primarily generated by actions of nitric oxide synthases on L-arginine. It may also be derived from nitrite by certain reducing systems (respiratory chain, xanthine oxidase) under hypoxic or anoxic conditions. NO was first identified as the primary mediator for the endothelium-dependent vasodilation in 1987 [23, 52]. Subsequently, this gaseous molecule has been found to play an important role in the regulation of many body functions. NO was named “Molecule of the Year” by Science magazine for its diversified actions in 1992. Robert F. Furchgott, Louis Ignarro, and Ferid Murad were awarded the Nobel Prize for their discovery of the signaling properties of NO in 1998. In the last 20 years, NO has become one of the most researched molecules. The scientific communities are constantly amazed by this gaseous messenger at its seemingly ever-expanding influences on various bodily activities [16, 19, 37, 40, 47, 67, 73, 76, 78].

The diversified biological actions of NO rely on the interactions between NO/NO derivatives and a broad range of biomolecules, in particular their reaction with the metal centers, thiols, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) [14, 67]. The interaction between NO and the metal center is best exemplified by the activation of soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC). When NO is bound to the ferrous state of the heme prosthetic group of the β1 subunit of sGC, a conformational change occurs that leads to the activation of the enzyme followed by an increased production of guanosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate (cGMP) and increased cGMP-dependent actions. The NO-cGMP-signaling pathway has been shown to regulate vasodilation, platelet aggregation, interneuronal communication, and gastrointestinal motility [21]. Another important example is the binding of NO to
the ferrous state of the heme $a3$ of cytochrome C oxidase (CcO) in competition with oxygen. This leads to reduced CcO activity and decreased mitochondria respiration. It may represent an adaptive response to adjust mitochondria to different cell challenges [12, 16].

The binding of NO to a thiol is referred to as S-nitrosation or S-nitrosylation. The latter is often used, more specifically, in the context of cellular signaling. A wide variety of proteins including kinases, channels, and transcription factors are susceptible to S-nitrosylation. Studies show that these reaction may occur at physiological concentrations of NO, being reversible, and highly specific [66]. For instance, at physiological partial pressure of oxygen nanomolar NO activates the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor by S-nitrosylating one out of 50 cysteine residues [17]. It has also reported that inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) specifically binds to cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) and S-nitrosylates the enzyme on Cys526, resulting in an increased COX-2 catalytic activity and enhanced prostaglandin E2 production [38]. These results and others support the notion proposed by Stamler and colleagues that S-nitrosylation may represent as a preeminent signaling pathway for NO [14, 66].

Under physiological conditions, interaction with metal center and S-nitrosylation are likely to be the major mechanisms for NO to exert its biological actions. The levels of superoxide anion ($\mathrm{O}_{2}^{-}$) are normally kept in the range of $10^{-11}$ to $10^{-10} \mathrm{M}$ while that of NO is in the range of $(10^{-9}$ to $10^{-7} \mathrm{M})$. Under these circumstances, peroxynitrite ($\mathrm{ONOO}^{-}$), a key metabolite of NO of redox signaling, is formed at a low rate by the reaction of NO with $\mathrm{O}_{2}^{-}$ in a 1:1 stoichiometry. Studies show that $\mathrm{ONOO}^{-}$ at low nanomolar levels, which are formed endogenously in cardiovascular cells, activates prostaglandin endoperoxide H2 synthase and leads to increased production of prostanoid. However, at ten- to 20-fold higher level, $\mathrm{ONOO}^{-}$ inhibits prostacyclin (PGI$_{2}$)-synthase formation and consequently switches the production of PGI$_{2}$ to that of thromboxane A$_{2}$ (TXA$_{2}$) [62]. Under pathophysiological conditions, $\mathrm{ONOO}^{-}$ and its derivatives are formed at high levels. These reactive nitrogen species (RNS) may cause irreversible damage to the respiratory chain, inhibition of ATP synthesis, cytochrome c release, and induction of caspase-dependent apoptosis. RNS at high concentrations may lead to lipid peroxidation, protein oxidation and nitration, enzyme inactivation, and eventually cell necrosis [61].

This review will highlight the role of NO in modulating muscle contractility (smooth muscle, cardiac, and skeletal muscle), platelet aggregation, metabolism (glucose, lipid, and amino acid metabolism), neuronal activity, and immune responses. Although it is clear that NO may affect many more bodily functions than we currently know, the

aforementioned areas have been studied in more details so far.

### Muscle contractility

#### Smooth muscle relaxation

NO is a potent endogenous relaxant in various smooth muscle types. Its dilator effect is primarily mediated by increasing the intracellular cGMP content resulting from the stimulation of sGC, a heterodimeric enzyme consisting of an alpha ($\alpha 1$ or $\alpha 2$) and a beta subunit ($\beta 1$). The $\alpha 1 \beta 1$ dimer is the dominate isoform expressed in most tissues, while the $\alpha 2 \beta 1$ isoform is present in fewer tissues but is highly expressed in the brain, lung, colon, heart, spleen, uterus, and placenta. sGC is activated by NO at concentrations $<10 \mathrm{nM}$ [30]. The activation of sGC increases the production of cGMP by 100- to 400-fold. It is proposed that the binding of NO to the sGC heme leads to form a five-coordinate ferrous nitrosyl complex and low-activity species, which is followed by the binding of additional NO to a nonheme site and a fully active enzyme [21].

Cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) is the primary enzyme for cGMP to reduce smooth muscle tone. In mammalian cells, PKG presents as two types, type I and type II. PKG I is highly expressed in platelets, smooth muscle, lung, and some brain nuclei. PKG II is detected in intestinal mucosa, renal cells, the adrenal cortex, the chondrocytes, and several brain nuclei, but not in cardiac and vascular myocytes. At the cell level, PKG I is present mainly in cytosol, although it is associated with membranes in some cell types such as platelets. PKG II is tightly bound to the plasma membrane by myristoylation of the N-terminal Gly-2 residue. Functionally, PKG I mediates smooth muscle relaxation and prevents platelet aggregation, whereas PKG II is primarily involved in regulating electrolyte and water secretion by epithelial tissues, endochondral ossification, aldosterone secretion, and the adjustment of the biological clock [20, 33].

Relaxation of smooth muscle mediated by PKG is mainly through reducing extracellular $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ entry, inhibiting $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ release from sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), and decreasing the sensitivity of myofilaments to $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ ($\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-desensitization). PKG may stimulate large conductance $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-activated $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ (BK$_{\mathrm{Ca}}$) channels, which leads to membrane hyperpolarization and reduction of the $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ influx through voltage-dependent $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels. BK$_{\mathrm{Ca}}$ channels may also be indirectly activated by an increased activity of spontaneous transient outward currents produced by small burst of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ released from the superficial SR, which occurs when an increased $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ influx into superficial SR and/or activation of ryanodine receptors by PKG. PKG I can also phosphorylate
inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP₃) receptor associated PKG I substrate (IRAG) and thus inhibit Ca²⁺ release from IP₃ receptor channels of the SR.

Myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation is a critical step that leads to activation of myosin ATPase and subsequent smooth muscle contraction. Studies suggest that PKG I can directly activate the catalytic subunit of the myosin light chain phosphatase (MLCP). PKG may also interfere with the inhibition of MLCP exerted by Rho kinase via phosphorylation of the small G protein RhoA and phosphorylation of MCLP regulatory subunit (MYPT1) at Ser-695 and Ser-852 [33, 36] (Fig. 1).

**Vascular Smooth Muscle Cell**

Fig. 1 Possible mechanisms of nitric oxide (NO)-mediated vasodilation. NO causes vascular smooth muscle to relax primarily by increasing the intracellular content of guanosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate (cGMP) resulted from the stimulation of soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC). Subsequently, cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) is activated. PKG may act by inhibiting Ca²⁺ influx through hyperpolarizing cell membrane via either direct stimulation of Ca²⁺-activated K⁺ channels (BKCa) or indirect activation of BKCa channels by increasing the activity of spontaneous transient outward current produced by small burst of Ca²⁺ released from the superficial sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), which is probably caused by an increased Ca²⁺ influx into superficial SR and/or an activated ryanodine receptor by PKG. PKG may also reduce Ca²⁺ release from SR into cytosol by inhibiting Ca²⁺ release from the SR via phosphorylating inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor (IP₃R) through IP₃-associated PKG-I substrate. The other major mechanism for PKG actions is through reducing the sensitivity of myofilaments to Ca²⁺ by stimulating MLCP, by interfering with the inhibitory effect of Rho kinase exerted on MLCP, and by inhibiting the small G protein RhoA-GTP. PKG may also be cross-activated by cAMP. In addition to PKG, NO can cause vasodilation by activating cGMP-inhibited PDE3 that leads to decreased degradation of cAMP. NO may also cause blood vessel to relax by directly S-nitrosylating BKCa channels and by stimulating the uptake of cytosolic Ca²⁺ via SR Ca²⁺ ATPase (SERCA) through formation of S-glutathione adducts with SERCA.

The red line indicates stimulatory effect, whereas the blue line indicates inhibitory effect

In PKG I knockout mice, the relaxation of isolated aorta and gastric fundus muscle strips caused by acetylcholine, electrical field stimulation, and the cGMP analog is largely abolished. These results indicate a critical role of cGMP-PKG signaling in smooth muscle relaxation induced by NO. PKG I knockout mice shows a slight hypertension in young animals, whereas in adult mice, the basal blood pressure is comparable to that of the wild-type animals. The less effective of PKG I-knockout may be due to that blood pressure is redundantly regulated by multi-mechanisms that are mutually compensated to certain extent [54]. PKG II-deficient mice have normal blood pressure. However, the inactivation of the PKG II gene abolishes cGMP-dependent inhibition of renin secretion in vitro and in vivo, indicating that PKG II may be also involved in hemodynamic regulation [33]. In addition to acting on PKG, cGMP may affect smooth muscle tone by cross-activating cAMP-dependent protein kinase and activating cGMP-inhibited phosphodiesterase (PDE3) [15, 24]. Cyclic nucleotide-gated cation channels, which can also be directly activated by cGMP, have been located in vascular smooth muscle. Their role, however, are not clear [79].

Although cGMP-PKG pathway has been well recognized as the primary mechanism for NO actions, NO can act independently of cGMP. NO may cause vasodilatation by enhancing BKCa activity via S-nitrosylation of cysteine residues in the alpha subunit [9]. NO has also been shown to cause blood vessel to relax by stimulating the uptake of cytosolic Ca²⁺ via the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca²⁺ ATPase (SERCA), thereby lowering intracellular free Ca²⁺. The NO action is through peroxynitrite formed by reacting with superoxide, which in turn lead to the formation of S-glutathione adducts with SERCA at cysteine-674. In atherosclerotic arteries, the effect of on SERCA is diminished due to an irreversible oxidation of the cysteine-674 thiol [1].

### Cardiac contractility

In the heart, NO is derived from the endothelium of coronary vasculature, cardiomyocytes, and nerve terminals. In cardiomyocytes, endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) is mainly localized to caveolae. It is estimated that 20% of cardiac eNOS is associated with cardiomyocytes [27]. Neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) is also present in cardiomyocytes, primarily localized to the sarcoplasmic reticulum [80]. When induced by specific cytokines, iNOS is also found in cytosol and other subcellular compartment of cardiomyocytes [80, 81].

NO released from the endothelial and endocardial cells has been demonstrated to exert negative inotropic effect, probably through PKG-dependent phosphorylation of troponin I, leading to myofilament Ca²⁺ desensitization [33,

[64]. Activation of eNOS in cardiomyocytes upon sympathetic stimulation has been reported to attenuate the inotropic and tachycardia effects. In contrast, the parasympathetic effect on the heart is potentiated by NO. Contraction of cardiomyocytes is also inhibited by NO-derived from nNOS through the inhibition of Ca²⁺ influx via L-type Ca²⁺ channels and the stimulation of SR Ca²⁺ uptake via phospholamban phosphorylation [63]. Collectively, the effects of NO lead to abbreviated contraction, increased diastolic interval, and reduced contraction frequency. Consequently, ventricular perfusion and filling are improved. The inhibitory inotropic effect of NO increases cardiac distensibility and thus promotes the recruitment of contractile reserve by stretch. It may be responsible for the positive inotropic response caused by sustained stretch, the so-called Anrep effect [4]. In addition to its effect on the cardiac contractility, NO, at physiological concentrations, may reduce myocardial mitochondria respiration via inhibition of CcO. Such a mechanism may contribute to improve mechanical efficiency [74].

### Skeletal muscle contractility

In skeletal muscle, NO is predominantly synthesized by nNOS, which is located mostly along the sarcolemma of type 2 fast-twitch fibers and concentrated at the postsynaptic surface of neuromuscular junction. Studies show that the submaximal contraction of rat diaphragm is increased following NOS inhibition while is decreased by NO donors, cGMP analogs, and phosphodiesterase inhibitors. These results suggest that cGMP may act as a mediator for the inhibitory action of NO. The effect of NO could not be fully explained by the cGMP action. Mechanisms independent of cGMP may also be involved, which include reversible oxidation of the sulfhydryl residues of myosin heavy chains by NO. NO can also prevent oxidative activation of the RyR by scavenging superoxide [56, 59].

eNOS is present at low levels in skeletal muscle. In eNOS-deficient mice, skeletal muscle contractility is not altered [32]. Since eNOS in skeletal muscle is closely associated with mitochondria, NO production from this site could affect muscle force production by reducing mitochondrial ATP production via inhibition of CcO or other mitochondrial enzymes [16]. Such a postulation, however, has not been proved [56].

### Platelet adhesion and aggregation

Platelets play an essential role in hemostasis. When vascular injury occurs, platelets are initially tethered to damage vessel wall via the interaction of platelet glycoprotein Ib-IX receptor complex with von Willebrand factor bound to collagen, which is followed by the binding of platelet glycoprotein VI to the exposed collagen and then the activation of platelets. Activated platelets change in shape, release diffusible mediators, and shift integrins from a low to a high affinity state. The integrins, in particular αIIbβ3, are critically involved in platelet adhesion and aggregation. The above process is strengthened in a positive feedback manner by the released mediators such as ADP and TXA₂ and locally produced thrombin to enable a firm adhesion of platelets to the extracellular matrix and to promote the aggregation of the recruited platelets for thrombus formation [50, 77].

Platelet adhesion and aggregation are inhibited by both endogenous and exogenous NO, as well as cGMP analogs [21, 78]. In mice deficient of sGC, the inhibitory effect of NO on agonist-induced platelet aggregation was totally abrogated [21]. In PKG I knockout mice, the inhibition of collagen-induced shape change, aggregation, and serotonin release observed in wild-type platelets are largely abolished [46]. These results indicate that the effects of NO on platelets are mediated predominantly via cGMP-PKG pathway. The PKG I concentration in human platelets (3.65 μM holoenzyme) is the highest among all the cell types studied. The regulatory cascade downstream of PKG I-mediated platelet inhibition is still not well understood. The IP₃ receptor associated PKG I substrate is abundantly expressed in platelets in a macrocomplex with PKG Iβ and the IP₃ receptor type I. In IRAG mutant mice, the inhibition of platelet activation and aggregation induced by NO and cGMP are lost. Arterial thrombosis of the injured carotid artery is not affected by NO in the mutant mice. These findings indicate a critical role for IRAG in NO-cGMP-dependent inhibition of platelet aggregation [3]. Vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP), a protein related to filamentous actin formation, is a major PKG substrate in platelets. VASP is phosphorylated by NO and cGMP. The phosphorylation of VASP is closely correlated with platelet inhibition and paralleled by the diminished activation of platelet fibrinogen receptor glycoprotein IIb–IIIa. Furthermore, in VASP knockout mice, platelet adhesion is enhanced and the inhibition of agonist-induced platelet adhesion induced by NO and cGMP is defective [45]. There are other PKG substrates have been identified in platelets such as heat shock protein 27, transient receptor potential canonical protein (TRPC1, TRPC6), and the small GTP-binding protein Rap 1b. Their role in NO and cGMP-mediated inhibition of platelet function remains to be elucidated [78].

### Metabolism

#### Glucose metabolism

NO at physiological levels stimulates glucose uptake and glycolysis. Glucose uptake is a rate-limiting step in glucose

metabolism. Glucose is a polarized molecule. It diffuses into the cell with the help of a family of highly related facilitative glucose transporters (GLUT). Among the 13 GLUT isoforms currently identified, GLUT4 is the major glucose transporter expressed in adipose, heart and skeletal muscles, and vascular smooth muscle. GLUT4 is sequestered in intracellular vesicles. Upon the binding of insulin to the receptor and followed by the activation of phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate–protein kinase B pathway, GLUT4 is translocated to the plasma membrane and facilitates the passive diffusion of glucose into cells. In cardiac muscle and to a lesser extent in skeletal muscle, contraction also stimulates the translocation of GLUT4 via an insulin-independent mechanism [68].

In humans as well as animal studies, NO donors dose-dependently increase glucose transport, whereas the inhibitor of NO synthase attenuates exercise-induced increases in glucose uptake by skeletal muscle without affecting blood flow [5]. Studies also show that prolonged treatment with NO upregulates the protein expression of GLUT4 in skeletal muscle. Moreover, GLUT4 expression in skeletal muscle is upregulated following exercise in a manner sensitive to the NOS inhibitor [60]. In addition to skeletal muscle, NO has been found to stimulate glucose transport in adipocytes, blood vessels, and astrocytes [37].

AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), the master switch in the regulation of intracellular energy homeostasis, is a potent stimulator of glucose uptake. In human umbilical venous cord endothelial cells (HUVECs) or isolated mice aortas, calcium ionophore A23187 and bradykinin significantly increased AMPK Thr-172 phosphorylation. The effect is abolished by the inhibition of nitric oxide synthase, suggesting that NO acts as an endogenous AMPK activator [82]. In response to nutrient deprivation, AMPK promotes energy-producing pathways such as glycolysis and fatty acid oxidation, while it inhibits energy-consuming pathways [31, 68]. In skeletal muscle and adipose tissues, glycolysis and glucose oxidation are stimulated by physiological levels of NO [37]. In astrocytes, NO has been found to rapidly increase the activity of 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase (PFK1), a master regulator of glycolysis, and increase the concentration of its most powerful positive allosteric activator, fructose-2,6-bisphosphate (F2,6P2) in an AMPK-dependent fashion [2, 8]. In contrast to the enhancement effects of NO on glucose uptake and glucose glycolysis, this gaseous molecule exerts an inhibitory effect on gluconeogenesis/glycogen synthesis. These effects are probably mediated by the inhibition of the activity and/or expression of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), an enzyme that catalyzes the rate-controlling step of gluconeogenesis, and by the inhibition of the activity of glycogen synthase [37].

Lipid metabolism

Studies suggest that NO, at physiological levels, promotes fatty acid oxidation in skeletal muscle, heart, liver, and adipose tissue [37]. In Zucker diabetic fatty rats, dietary L-arginine supplementation reduces fat mass, which is associated with enhanced NO production and lipolysis. Microarray analysis indicates that arginine supplementation increases adipose tissue expression of key genes responsible for fatty acid oxidation [22]. Mitochondria are key organelles for free fatty acid (FFA) oxidation. In eNOS knockout mice, there is about 30% decrease in the mitochondria content accompanied with a markedly lower FFA oxidation and a significant increase in the intracellular lipid content in skeletal muscle [42]. In adipocytes, NO has been shown to increase the phosphorylation of hormone-sensitive lipase and perilipins leading to the translocation of the lipase to the neutral lipid droplets and hence enhance lipolysis [37].

The de novo fatty acid synthesis in liver is inhibited by NO [37]. The effect may result from an AMPK-dependent inhibition of the activity of acetyl-CoA carboxylase, which catalyzes the carboxylation of acetyl CoA to malonyl CoA, a key substrate in chain elongation in fatty acid biosynthesis. Malonyl-CoA also acts allosterically to inhibit carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1), an enzyme which transports activated fatty acids into the mitochondria for oxidation. The reduced level of malonyl-CoA thus leads to increased CPT1 activity and fatty acid oxidation. AMPK also reduces fatty acid synthesis by directly inhibiting the activity of fatty acid synthase and by inhibiting the activity of the isoform 1c of sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP1c), a transcription factor responsible for regulating the genes needed to make fatty acids [68].

Amino acid metabolism

Increase in NO production in rat hepatocytes causes profound decrease in total protein synthesis [13]. In vascular smooth muscle cells, NO donors inhibit polyamine synthesis from arginine/ornithine and cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner [35]. Although it is well recognized that AMPK can be activated by NO and that the activation of AMPK may lead to the inhibition of protein synthesis, the role of AMPK in the effect of NO has not been clearly defined. AMPK may inhibit protein metabolism through two mechanisms. First, it inhibits the initiation of mRNA translation by blocking peptide elongation through activating eukaryote elongation factor 2 kinase. Secondly, it inhibits the peptide translation and ribosome biogenesis by inactivating mammalian target of rapamycin complex pathway [68].

Mitochondrial respiration

Substantial evidence suggests that NO at physiological concentrations inhibits mitochondrial respiration by acting on CcO. CcO contains a copper-copper dimer (CuA), heme \(a\), and a binuclear heme-copper coupled center (heme \(a3/\) CuB). Under hypoxic conditions, the enzyme is more abundant in its reduced form, which leads to the binding of NO to the heme \(a3\) in the ferrous state in competition with oxygen. CcO has a greater affinity for NO than for oxygen. Consequently, the reduction of oxygen is inhibited [55]. CcO is present in excess of the amount required to meet normal metabolic demand. Therefore, inhibition of the enzyme does not result in significant reduction mitochondrial respiration until the threshold is reached [11].

Under normoxia, CcO is more abundant in its oxidized form. NO binds to the oxidized form of the CuB center. The reaction of NO with reduced CcO can be reversed by oxygen, whereas that with oxidized CcO cannot be reversed. Rather, NO is converted to nitrite and then dissociates from the enzyme [16, 69]. The source of mitochondrial NO may come from the action of mitochondrial NOS, which is likely to be a post-translationally modified variant of nNOSα translocated into mitochondria. Since NO is very diffusible, a significant part of NO in mitochondrial matrix may be generated by cytosolic neuronal or endothelial NOS [55].

It is increasingly recognized that NO-dependent inhibition of mitochondrial respiration is likely to be a part of a constitutive cytoprotective housekeeping mechanism. CcO is the terminal acceptor in the mitochondrial electron transport chain. Its inhibition leads to incomplete reduction of oxygen and hence increased generation of \(\mathrm{O}_2^{-}\)and consequently \(\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}_2\), which may act as a second messenger to activate AMPK. In cultured HUVECs, AMPK is activated by hypoxia in the absence of significant change in AMP levels. The effect is sensitive not only to the inhibition of NOS but also sensitive to antioxidants or depletion of mitochondrial DNA [57]. It is suspected that an increased production of ROS resulting from the inhibition of CcO by NO may activate the \(\alpha2\) isoform of AMPK, which is less responsive to change in AMP levels [16, 68].

AMPK is implicated as a critical mediator for the augmented uptake of glucose and enhanced glycolysis caused by NO [2, 8, 82]. Studies also show that NO and AMPK cause similar metabolism effects, including the stimulatory effects on glycolysis, fatty acid oxidation, and lipolysis as well as the inhibitory effects on gluconeogenesis and the synthesis of glycogen, fatty acid, and protein [2, 8, 13, 22, 35, 37, 42, 68, 82]. Therefore, it is tempting to postulate that AMPK may act as a key mediator for NO actions related to metabolism (Fig. 2). The effects of NO on

![Figure 2](#fig-2)

Fig. 2 Possible mechanisms for the role of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in nitric oxide (NO) actions related to metabolism of glucose, lipid, and protein. NO at physiological concentrations can inhibit cytochrome C oxidase that leads to incomplete reduction of oxygen and thus increased generation of reactive oxygen species. Among the oxygen radicals, \(\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}_2\) may act as a second messenger to activate AMPK. Studies demonstrate that both NO and AMPK have the following effects: (1) increase glucose transportation through glucose transporter subclass 4 (GLUT4); (2) augment glycolysis through activating PFK1 and elevating F2,6P2; (3) inhibit gluconeogenesis by suppressing the activity of PEPCK; (4) inhibit glycogen synthesis by suppressing the activity of glycogen synthase; (5) enhance fatty acid oxidation while attenuate fatty acid synthesis by inhibiting the activity of acetyl-CoA carboxylase; (6) enhance lipolysis by phosphorylating hormone-sensitive lipase and perilipins; and (7) inhibit protein synthesis. Among these effects, only the effects of NO in (1) and (2) aforementioned have been found to be AMPK-dependent. The involvement of AMPK in the other NO effects on metabolism remains to be determined. eEF-2 eukaryote elongation factor 2, ETC mitochondrial electron transport chain, mTORC mammalian target of rapamycin complex. The red line indicates stimulatory effect, whereas the blue line indicates inhibitory effect

metabolism appears to switch on catabolic pathways that generate ATP, while switching off anabolic pathways that consume ATP [37, 68].

NO also plays a key role in mitochondrial biogenesis. NO has been shown to increase mitochondrial content in a number of cell types in a cGMP-dependent manner. This effect occurs through increased expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator 1α, nuclear respiratory factor-1, and mitochondrial transcription factor A [49].

Neuronal activity

Central nervous system

In central nervous system (CNS) NO is derived from nNOS in neurons and from eNOS of vascular endothelial cells. Although nNOS presents in only 1% of neurons, their processes ramify so extensively that virtually every cell in the brain is likely to be exposed to NO. This gaseous molecule has been found to subserve many different

functions, such as learning, feeding, wake and sleep, neurosecretion, and behaviors [10, 19, 25, 58].

Long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) of synaptic transmission are defined as activity dependent increase and decrease in synaptic transmission strength, respectively. They are the basic mechanisms related to memory and learning. It is now well recognized that NO-cGMP-PKG-signaling pathway plays a key role in both LTP and LTD at many synapses throughout the CNS. In double knockout mice lacking both eNOS and nNOS, LTP in the CA1 region of hippocampus is reduced. Evidence indicates that the formation of LTP may result from PKG II-dependent phosphorylation of S845 of GluR1, a subunit of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPARs). Consequently, the expression and activity of AMPARs are increased at the postsynaptic membrane. The activation of AMPARs opens N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) channels and leads to an increased calcium influx, which is a critical event in the synaptic plasticity underlying LTP [65]. LTP may also be induced by the enhancement of synaptic transmission with NO as a retrograde messenger. In the Shaffer collateral/CA1 synapses of the hippocampus, NO released from the postsynaptic neuron upon NMDA receptor activation may diffuse into the pre-synaptic neuron to increase the stimulated release of glutamate via cGMP-PKG I cascade. It is believed that the PKG effect is mediated by VASP. The phosphorylation of VASP may modulate presynaptic cytoskeletal structures linked to transmitter release from the synaptic vesicles [19].

The induction of LTD of the parallel fiber-Purkinje cell synapse in the cerebellum has been associated with specific forms of motor learning. nNOS has not been detected in postsynaptic Purkinje cells. However, NO released from either parallel fibers or from interneurons that simultaneously receive parallel fiber excitation may diffuse into postsynaptic Purkinje cells, where NO induces a PKG-dependent inhibition of the protein phosphatase 1/2A. Consequently, it leads to increased phosphorylation and endocytosis of postsynaptic AMPARs and hence facilitated LTD. Knocking down PKG1α specifically in Purkinje cells has been found to impair LTD and introduce a deficit in a motor learning behavior [18, 19, 25].

In addition to neurons, NO produced by eNOS in the cerebral circulation may have a significant effect on neuronal activities. For instance, NO generated from eNOS in microvascular endothelial cells persistently depolarize axons by activating hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channels via cGMP [26]. Studies also show that astrocytes in the cerebellum have the highest cGMP level due to their extremely low phosphodiesterase activity. The slow kinetics of cGMP degradation enables the astrocytes to exert a tonic influence on nearby synaptic

activity. Indeed, the cerebella cGMP levels in vivo (largely reflecting glial cGMP) has been found to be closely correlated with the motor activity [25].

Peripheral nervous system

In peripheral nervous system, NO acts as a neurotransmitter of the nitrergic nerves that receive electrical signals from the central nervous system via parasympathetic preganglionic fibers and ganglia. NO released from the nitrergic nerves is produced by nNOS and plays an important role in the regulation of the activities of smooth muscle of the blood vessel, the gastrointestinal tract, the penile corpora cavernosa, the urethra, and the prostate. [70–72].

Although it is clear that NO released from the endothelium play a pivotal role in regulating circulatory function, increasing evidence suggests that NO released from nitrergic nerves may exert a distinct influence on vascular tone. In humans, intracoronary infusion of a specific nNOS inhibitor reduces the basal coronary blood flow but has no effect on the increase in blood flow caused by substance P. Both basal and substance P-induced increase in coronary blood flow is reduced by a nonselective NOS inhibitor. Similar phenomenon has also been observed in a study in human radial artery blood flow. These data suggest an active role for nNOS in regulating the basal vascular tone [63]. The involvement of nitrergic innervation in the modulation of vessel tone has been reported in various vessel types. The data available so far indicate a more pronounced role of nitrergic NO in regulating the vascular activities of cerebral artery, penile artery, and vein. Cerebral vasodilation or increased cerebral blood flow induced by nerve stimulation have been found to be susceptible to selective nNOS inhibitors and sGC inhibitors. Histochemical studies also demonstrate nNOS-positive nerve fibers in the immediate vicinity of intracerebral arterioles. Furthermore, cerebral vasodilator responses in response to the stimulation of efferent nerves are reduced in nNOS- but not in eNOS- and iNOS-deficient mice [71, 73]. Similar observations have also been documented in penile vasculature [70, 73].

The importance of nitrergic NO in regulating the motility of gastrointestinal tract (GI) is evident in mice deficient of nNOS. These mice show pyloric stenosis and severe GI dysfunction such that liquid-food feeding is necessary for survival [29]. Deletion of sGC by knock-out of the β1 subunit causes severe GI disturbances including enlarged esophagus, pyloric stenosis, enlarged caecum, and increased gut transit time [21]. Similar GI disturbances are also reported in mice lacking PKG-I [54]. These data indicate a critical role for cGMP-PKG in mediating nitrergic GI actions. Nitrergic NO acts on GI not only by inhibiting smooth muscle tone but also by influencing fluid
secretion in the GI tract. NO released from the nitrergic nerve and from the vascular endothelium may protect the mucosa against noxious stimuli by increasing mucosal blood flow. Studies show that heterogeneity exists in the role of nitrergic nerves along GI tract, being more pronounced in the proximal portion than in the distal one. Evidence also indicates that nitrergic innervations and activity are greater in circular than in longitudinal muscle of GI tract [72, 73].

In primate as well as nonprimate mammals, it is generally recognized that nitrergic activity has a dominant role in penis erection. NO released from nitrergic nerves upon stimulation initiates the erectile response by dilating cavernous and helicine arteries as well as the trabecular smooth muscle. The increased blood flow associated with increased compliance of the cavernosal space leads to a high intracavernous pressure and penile erection. The maintenance of the erection may result from the action of both nitrergic NO and NO released from the vascular endothelial and sinusoidal cells. It is believed that NO may be released from the endothelium by shear stress resulting from the increased blood flow [70, 73]. In eNOS- and nNOS-deficient mice, however, the erectile function and reproductive capacity are preserved. It is found that the action of nNOSβ, a splice variant, is accountable for the residual NOS activity. Interestingly, although the residual nNOS generates only 10% of the normal NO level in vitro, but possesses a NOS activity in vivo comparable to that of wide-type mice. These results suggest that the alternatively spliced forms of nNOS may act as the major mediators of penile erection [34]. The erection action of NO is likely to be mediated mainly by cGMP [21]. This forms the biological basis of sildenafil (Viagra), which augments the elevation of cGMP by inhibiting cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase, an enzyme specialized for cGMP degradation [6].

lead to the formation of ONOO⁻ in high amount. Peroxynitrite may further augment the inflammatory response through activating pro-inflammation signaling. It appears that the activation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) that occurs following peroxynitrite-induced DNA damage contributes to a positive-feedback amplification of inflammatory response. PARP may also act as a coactivator of multiple crucial proinflammatory cascades, including mitogen activated protein kinases, activator protein-1, and nuclear transcription factor kappa B (NF-kB). This leads to a greater expression of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, enzymes, and adhesion molecules [51].

NF-kB is a crucial transcription factor of many genes involved in inflammation. The anti-inflammation effect of constituent NOS-derived NO may result in part from the attenuated activation of NF-kB by scavenging ROS, enhancing expression and/or stabilization of I-kB, and inhibiting the binding of the p50/p65 heterodimer to its consensus sequence in the promoter/enhancer region upstream of intercellular adhesion molecule-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, and E-selectin [40]. In contrast, the pro-inflammation effect of peroxynitrite may result in part from the activation of NF-kB. Peroxynitrite, both exogenously added or endogenously produced, potently activates NF-kB and stimulates thereby interleukin-8 secretion by human polymorphonuclear cells. It is proposed that nitration of tyrosine-42 of the endogenous inhibitor of NF-kB may increase its degradation and thus activate NF-kB [51].

### Antimicrobial effect

NO generated in high amount in macrophages and other immune system cells is critically involved in host defense against infectious organisms including bacteria, viruses, parasites, and fungi. NO and its derivatives in particular peroxynitrite may exert their antimicrobial effect by causing DNA damage, inhibiting protein synthesis, altering proteins by S-nitrosylation, ADP-ribosylation or tyrosine nitration, inactivating enzymes through disruption of Fe-S clusters, zinc fingers or heme groups, or oxidizing membrane lipids [7]. NO and its derivatives have been shown to inhibit bacterial DNA replication by disrupting zinc metalloproteins and by inhibiting ribonucleotide reductase via reactions with a tyrosyl radical in the enzyme. NO inhibits viral RNA entry into cells by nitrating core proteins expressed on the surface of coxsackievirus via peroxynitrite. It inhibits viral replication by S-nitrosylating proteinases and by inhibiting transcription factors that are required for viral replication [39, 43]. The effectiveness of NO as an antimicrobial agent differs depending on its local concentration and redox environment as well as the pathogens. Many pathogenic bacteria possess mechanisms to protect them from nitrosative stress, such as the nitric oxide
reductase of *Neisseria meningitidis* and the flavohemoglobins of *Salmonella enterica* and *Escherichia coli* [41]. The microorganism may also develop tolerance to NO and its derivatives. For instance, *E. coli* has been found to be protected from NO-induced growth inhibition by over-expressing cytochrome bd, a terminal quinol oxidase of the aerobic respiratory chain under nitrosative stress [44].

### Immunoregulatory effect

T helper cells are a distinct subset of lymphocytes that play an important role in establishing and maximizing the capabilities of the immune system. T helper cells may proliferate and differentiate into two major subtypes of cells termed as Th1 and Th2 cells. Generally speaking, Th1 cells are associated with inflammatory response against intracellular pathogens via activation of macrophage, whilst Th2 cells are closely involved in humoral immune response which utilizes antibodies to neutralize extracellular pathogens and toxins. This dichotomy of Th1 and Th2 cells is crucial to the balance of immune response. NO at low concentrations has been shown to induce the differentiation of Th1 but not Th2 cells; at high concentrations, NO may inhibit Th1 response but enhance Th2 response, which may promote inflammation in allergic diseases such as asthma but inhibit the inflammatory response to viral and bacterial pathogens [43, 48].

Recent studies suggest that hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), a major regulator of cellular adaptive metabolic and survival responses to low oxygen stress, may act as a global regulator of macrophage and neutrophil inflammatory and innate immune functions [83]. HIF-1α has been found to be induced by bacterial infection, even under normoxia, and to regulate the production of key immune effector molecules. Mice lacking HIF-1α in their myeloid cell lineage shows reduced bactericidal activity and enhanced spread of infection from an initial tissue focus [53]. It is possible that NO may modulate immune response via its influence on HIF-1 activity. Under normoxia, NO or RNS can inhibit HIF-1α degradation by preventing its hydroxylation via prolyl hydroxylase (PHD) either by a direct inhibition of PHD or by the nitrosation of HIF-1 cysteine-533 within the oxygen-dependent degradation domain. NO also promotes HIF-1 activity by the nitrosation of the HIF-1 cysteine-800, which result in an increased recruitment of the transcriptional coactivator P300/CREB-binding protein, thus a greater transcription activity [4].

### Conclusion

Under physiological conditions, NO acts mainly by stimulating sGC, inhibiting mitochondria CcO, and nitrosylating various proteins and lipids [14, 16, 21]. A prominent role for sGC in mediating NO actions is attributable to the widespread expression of the enzyme in various cell types [21] and its very high sensitivity to NO (100 pM–5 nM) [30]. CcO is emerging as another important mediator for NO actions. It is estimated that CcO is inhibited in vivo by NO at concentrations of 10–25 nM [30]. The inhibition of CcO by NO not only affects mitochondria respiration, but also affects metabolism through activating AMPK via mitochondria-derived ROS. The inhibition of CcO by NO may also lead to increased degradation of HIF-1α and hence increased activities of several redox-sensitive transcription factors [16].

Nitrosylation represents another important mechanism that is increasingly being recognized for NO and its derivatives to influence a wide range of functions, including the activities of various kinases, channels, transcription factors, structural proteins, proteases, and respiratory enzymes in a very specific and reversible manner [14, 28, 67]. NO is a poor nitrosylating compound. Nitrosothiol formation is often mediated by oxidative derivatives of NO, which occurs more efficient in hydrophobic microenvironments. It is postulated that, in cell compartments, nitrosylation and nitration are the prevailing reactions when NO/O₂⁻ flux ratio is >10 and between 2 and 3, respectively. However, when NO/O₂⁻ ratio is reduced to 1, peroxynitrite becomes the dominant nitrogen species, and nitrosative stress may ensue [51, 75].

In the last two decades, NO has proven itself a very diversified cellular messenger involved in a broad range of biological functions [16, 19, 37, 40, 47, 73, 76, 78]. In this review, only a limited aspect of NO actions has been discussed in a rather brief and oversimplified fashion. The pleiotropic actions of NO ranged from physiological to pathophysiological effects rely on the nearly omnipresent of this gaseous molecule in different body systems, the complicate interactions between NO/NO derivatives and their targets, and the sophisticated influence of local environments on the final outcome [28, 75]. These facts will certainly make the future research on NO full of challenges and excitements.
