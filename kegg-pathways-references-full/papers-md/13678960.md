The vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family of ligands and receptors has been the focus of attention in vascular biology for more than a decade. There is now a consensus that the VEGFs are crucial for vascular development and neovascularization in physiological and pathological processes in both embryo and adult. This has facilitated a rapid transition to their use in clinical applications, for example, administration of VEGF ligands to enhance vascularization of ischaemic tissues and, conversely, inhibitors of VEGF-receptor function in anti-angiogenic therapy. More recent data indicate essential roles for the VEGFs in haematopoietic cell function and in lymphangiogenesis.

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) denotes a family of homodimeric glycoproteins, which currently consists of five mammalian and one parapoxvirus-encoded member. The VEGFs bind, in an overlapping pattern, to three different VEGF-receptor tyrosine kinases. Binding of the VEGF to the receptors induces receptor dimerization and activation and, thereby, transduction of signals that direct cellular function. The VEGF polypeptides, as well as the receptors, might heterodimerize in a manner directed by the cellular expression pattern, which would enable modulation of the signal transduction cascade. Hypoxia is an important regulator of VEGF expression and hypoxia-driven de-regulated VEGF expression is implicated in several diseases that are characterized by excess angiogenesis (e.g. cancer) [1]. Thus, most if not all types of tumour express VEGF, leading to vascularization of the tumour and expansion of the tumour mass [2]. In addition, several growth factors produced by tumour cells affect tumour vascularization indirectly, by inducing VEGF production. Endothelial cells in the tumour blood vessels express VEGF receptor (VEGFR) -2, but might also express VEGFR-1 and -3. Recent data implicate VEGFR-1 primarily in haematopoietic cell development and recruitment, for example, in tumour tissue [3]. VEGFR-3 is expressed at high levels in lymphatic endothelial cells, but is also important for vascular development and is expressed in certain normal vessels and tumour vessels [4]. Thus, whereas the three VEGFRs have distinct functions in separate tissue compartments, they might also converge functionally to promote pathological vessel formation in certain diseases (Table 1).

The VEGFs

VEGF-A, the original VEGF, exists in four different isoforms (comprising 121, 165, 189 and 206 amino acids in humans), which are generated by alternative splicing of a single pre-mRNA species. The region encoding VEGF-A spans ~14kb and contains eight exons (Fig. 1). The isoforms differ in their ability to bind to heparan sulfate and extracellular matrix (ECM). VEGF-A₁₂₁, which lacks the region encoded by exons six and seven, does not bind to heparan sulfate and is freely diffusible, whereas the other isoforms bind to heparan sulfate and ECM to increasing extents. VEGF-A₁₂₁ is not a substitute for other isoforms; mice expressing only VEGF-A₁₂₀ (mouse VEGF is one amino acid shorter) die early postnatally and display signs of cardiomyopathy [5]. VEGF-A was originally identified as vascular permeability factor (VPF) – a designation reflecting the important and unique *in vivo* function of VEGF-A [6] (Box 1). Another important feature of VEGF-A is its increased expression during conditions of hypoxia, which is regulated by a hypoxia-responsive element in its promoter [7]. Thus, VEGF is crucial for vascular development, as well as physiological and pathological angiogenesis. In addition, VEGF-A might stimulate lymphangiogenesis [8]. Several mammalian VEGF-related proteins [VEGF-B, -C, -D and placenta growth factor (PlGF)] have been described. VEGF-B and PlGF bind only to VEGFR-1; VEGF-C and VEGF-D are expressed as propeptides that primarily bind to VEGFR-3. Processed mature ligands bind to VEGFR-3 with higher affinity and can also bind and activate VEGFR-2 [9]. Apart from these mammalian VEGF-family

proteins, a sheep parapoxvirus open reading frame encodes a VEGF-related protein denoted VEGF-E, which binds only to VEGFR-2 [10].

Expression, signal transduction and function of VEGFR-1 VEGFR-1 (also known as Flt-1) is a 180-kDa high-affinity receptor for VEGF-A, VEGF-B and PlGF. It is expressed in vascular endothelial cells and a range of non-endothelial cells including haematopoietic stem cells, macrophages and monocytes (Fig. 2). Vegfr-1⁻/⁻ mouse embryos die at day 8.5–9 due to obstruction of vessels by an overgrowth of endothelial cells [11]. The increase in the number of endothelial progenitors in the absence of VEGFR-1 [12] implies a negative regulatory role for the receptor during vascular development that appears to be exerted by the soluble form of VEGFR-1 (sVEGFR-1), which lacks the transmembrane and intracellular part of the receptor. sVEGFR-1 is expressed at considerable levels in the placenta during pregnancy [13]; it binds VEGF-A with high affinity, preventing binding of the growth factor to the

Box 1. Vascular permeability

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is one of the most potent vascular permeability agents known, an activity that is unique among cytokines. Vascular permeability becomes evident within a minute or two following VEGF injection in the dermis and persists for ~20 min. The vascular permeability induced by VEGF is not blocked by inhibitors of inflammation, including those that block histamine, thrombin and platelet-activating factor. Tumour blood vessels are hyperpermeable to plasma proteins, which can be directly attributed to expression of VEGF by the tumour cells. The leakage of plasma proteins and other macromolecules into the tumour tissue has been suggested to form the basis for a new provisional fibrin-rich extracellular matrix, which facilitates the angiogenic process. The signal-transduction events regulating VEGF-induced vascular permeability are not fully understood, but VEGFR-2 appears to be solely responsible for transducing the effect. VEGF induces fenestrations in endothelial cells [77], which could constitute part of the morphological basis for increased permeability. Dvorak and coworkers have studied morphological changes in VEGF-permeabilized microvesels and have identified a tumour-endothelium-specific organelle – vesiculo-vacuolar organelle – which forms a system of interconnected vacuoles that traverse the endothelium [78].

functional VEGFRs. Deletion of the intracellular domain of VEGFR-1 (Vegfr-1tk⁻/⁻) is compatible with normal vascular development [14], strongly suggesting that the physiological role of VEGFR-1 in development might be to sequester excess VEGF. Haematopoietic stem cells [15, 16] as well as circulating CD97⁺ monocytes or macrophages [17] express VEGFR-1, which appears to be essential for migration of these cells [18, 19]. Indeed, macrophages from the Vegfr-1tk⁻/⁻ mice fail to migrate towards VEGF-A or PlGF [14]. Haematopoietic cells accumulate in the tumour tissue and have recently been shown to promote tumour vascularization [3]. Growth of tumours expressing PlGF, is impaired in the Vegfr-1tk⁻/⁻ mice [20], suggesting that the intracellular domain of VEGFR-1 might regulate tumour angiogenesis. Furthermore, recent data show that inhibition of VEGFR-1 function by neutralizing antibodies leads to reduced tumour growth and a decreased number of perivascular haematopoietic cells in the tumour [21, 22] (Box 2). Other non-endothelial cell types expressing VEGFR-1 include spermatogenic and Leydig cells [23] and osteoclasts [24]. Excess production of VEGF-A in these compartments might promote the development of male sterility and inflammatory joint disease, respectively.

VEGFR-1 binds VEGF-A with high affinity (Kd 10 pM), however, ligand binding results in a maximal twofold increase in kinase activity. Activation of VEGFR-1 can be discerned only in cells engineered to overexpress the receptor [25, 26]. VEGFR-1 phosphorylation sites have been mapped in such models. Remarkably, VEGFR-1 appears not to be phosphorylated on consensus positive regulatory tyrosine residues, which could explain its low level of kinase activity. It is possible that VEGFR-1 activation and signal transduction is correctly revealed only when analyzed in primary endothelial cells, or monocytes or macrophages expressing the receptor endogenously.

VEGFR-1 has been shown to negatively influence VEGFR-2 function in cells expressing chimaeric VEGFR proteins [27, 28]. Antagonizing signals from VEGFR-1 that override mitogenic signals from VEGFR-2 have been

Fig. 2. Schematic illustration of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor (VEGFR) expression patterns and ligand specificity. The VEGF ligand family includes VEGF-A, -B, -C, -D, -E and placenta growth factor (PIGF), which all bind in a specific manner to three different receptor tyrosine kinases, VEGFR-1, -2 and -3. The extracellular domain of VEGFR-1 is also expressed as a soluble protein. VEGFR-1 and its ligands are yellow, VEGFR-2 and its ligands are blue, and VEGFR-3 and its ligands are green. Ligands shaded in two colours bind to more than one receptor type. Both PIGF and VEGF-B are selective ligands for VEGFR-1, whereas VEGF-E is a selective ligand for VEGFR-2. Unprocessed VEGF-C and -D are selective ligands for VEGFR-3. By contrast, all VEGF-A isoforms bind to both VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2, and processed VEGF-C and VEGF-D ligands interact with both VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3. VEGFR-1 is expressed in haematopoietic stem cells, macrophages and monocytes as well as on the vascular endothelium. VEGFR-2 is expressed on both the vascular and lymphatic endothelium, whereas VEGFR-3 is predominantly expressed on the lymphatic endothelium. Vascular endothelium shows endothelial cells with tight inter-endothelial junctions surrounded by a continuous layer of basement membrane. The vessel is stabilized by specialized smooth-muscle cells, denoted pericytes. By contrast, the lymphatic endothelium lack inter-endothelial junctions, basement membrane and supporting pericytes, all of which contribute to the permeability of lymphatic vessels to interstitial fluid. Lymphatic endothelial cells are anchored to the surrounding tissue by filaments.

Box 2. The angiogenic switch

Most, if not all, tumours display upregulated vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) mRNA levels and produce VEGF protein, preferentially the VEGF-A<sub>165</sub> isoform. The hypoxic state of the growing tumour triggers expression of hypoxia-inducible factor, which binds to the VEGF-A promoter to stimulate increased VEGF production. Hanahan and coworkers [79] have studied a transgenic multi-stage carcinogenesis model of insulin-promoter regulated simian virus 40 large T-induced insulinoma (the Rip-Tag model). In this model, the progression from premalignant hyperproliferative lesions to carcinoma is dependent on an angiogenic switch. Thus, only a subset of the hyperproliferative islands show evidence of angiogenesis, whereas all carcinomas are vascularized (Fig. I). The switch is not accompanied by increased expression levels of VEGF, as was anticipated. Similarly, VEGF receptor (VEGFR)-1 and VEGFR-2 are expressed at similar levels before and after the switch. Instead, the angiogenic switch involves the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 [80]. MMP-9 is not expressed in tumour cells, but is secreted by monocytes and macrophages, which infiltrate the tumour tissue in a VEGFR-1-dependent manner. MMP-9 activity releases VEGF from the extracellular matrix and enables formation of functional VEGF–VEGFR-2 complexes [80].

Fig. 3. Schematic illustration of vascular endothelial growth-factor receptor (VEGFR)-2 intracellular signalling. Ligand binding to the extracellular domain induces dimerization and the autophosphorylation of specific intracellular tyrosine residues. Several intracellular proteins such as VEGFR-associated protein (VRAP), Sck and phospholipase C (PLC)-γ bind to specific tyrosine residues via their Src homology-2 (SH2) domains, leading to the phosphorylation and activation of these proteins. PLC-γ activation results in hydrolysis of the membrane phospholipid phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate (PIP₂), which leads to the generation of the second messengers sn-1,2-diacyl-glycerol (DAG) and inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate (IP₃). DAG is a physiological activator of protein kinase C (PKC), whereas IP₃ binds to a specific receptor present on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), resulting in the release of intracellular stored Ca²⁺ and an increase in the intracellular concentration of Ca²⁺ [Ca²⁺]i. Many proteins are activated by the VEGFR-2 via an unknown mechanism, these include Src, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK). Downstream signal transduction molecules propagate a signal leading to several different endothelial cellular functions such as survival, permeability, migration and proliferation.

shown to depend on phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), but the exact mechanisms remain to be identified. Notably, receptor heterodimerization is not a prerequisite for the negative influence of VEGFR-1. Thus, the signalling capacity of heterodimers of VEGFR-1 and -2 is similar to that of VEGFR-2 homodimers, at least with regard to signal transducers such as phospholipase C-γ₁ (PLC-γ₁) [29].

Expression, signal transduction and function of VEGFR-2

VEGFR-2 (also known as KDR or Flk-1), is a 200–230-kDa high-affinity receptor for VEGF-A, the processed forms of VEGF-C and -D, and VEGF-E. It is expressed in both vascular endothelial and lymphatic endothelial cells; its expression has also been demonstrated in several other cell types such as megakaryocytes and haematopoietic stem cells [30]. Vegfr-2⁻/⁻ embryos die by embryonic day 8.5–9.5, exhibiting defects in the development of endothelial and haematopoietic precursors, indicating that the receptor is crucial for vascular development [31].

VEGF-A binds to the second and third extracellular IgG-loop of VEGFR-2 with a Kd of 75–125 pM, which is lower than the affinity of VEGF-A for VEGFR-1 [32].

Resulting tyrosine-phosphorylation sites in the VEGFR-2 intracellular domain are indicated in Fig. 3. To date, Tyr951 and Tyr996 present in the kinase-insert domain, Tyr1054 and Tyr1059 in the kinase domain, and Tyr1175 and Tyr1214 in the C-terminal tail, have all been identified as autophosphorylation sites. Several proteins have been found to associate, via their Src homology-2 (SH2) domain, with specific autophosphorylated tyrosine residues. Tyr951 creates a binding site for the VEGFR-associated protein (VRAP) [33] and Tyr1175 creates a binding site for Sck [34] and PLC-γ₁ [35].

VEGFR-2 is considered to be the major mediator of several physiological and pathological effects of VEGF-A on endothelial cells. These include proliferation and survival, migration and permeability. The intracellular signalling pathways mediating these effects downstream of VEGFR-2 activation are shown schematically in Fig. 3. VEGFR-2, like many other receptors, induces proliferation through activation of the classical extracellular regulated kinase (Erk) pathway (p42/44 mitogen-activated protein kinase), leading to gene transcription. In the case of VEGFR-2, it was originally reported that Raf was directly

activated via protein kinase C (PKC) in a Ras-independent manner [36]. However, recent data has shown that VEGF-A can stimulate Ras [37] via a pathway that requires PKC and sphingosine kinase [38]. VEGFR-2 also activates PI3K, which results in an increase in the lipid phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)P₃ and activation of several important intracellular molecules such as Akt (also denoted protein kinase B or Akt/PKB) and the small GTP-binding protein Rac. The Akt/PKB pathway regulates cellular survival by inhibiting pro-apoptotic pathways such as B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2)-associated death promoter homologue (BAD) and Caspase 9 [39]. The Akt/PKB pathway also activates endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) [40,41], generating NO, which is implicated in the increase in vascular permeability and cellular migration observed with VEGF-A. The small GTP-binding protein Rac has also been implicated in regulating vascular permeability [42] and cellular migration. Other components implicated in VEGFR-2-dependent cytoskeletal regulation and cell migration include p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) [43] and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and its substrate paxillin [44]. Several other important intracellular signalling molecules are activated by VEGFR-2, notably Src. Although it is not yet clear exactly how the VEGFR-2 interacts with Src or its downstream role, mice lacking of the Src family members Src and Yes show impaired VEGF-A-induced vascular permeability [45].

VEGFR-2 function is modulated through co-receptors such as heparan sulfated proteoglycans, which interact with certain VEGF isoforms and with VEGFR-2 [46]. The functional VEGF–VEGFR-2 complex includes neuropilins [47], which are ubiquitous membrane-bound molecules also implicated in axon guidance by binding to the collapsin (also denoted semaphorin) family members [48]. Neuropilin-1 is essential for vascular development [49], whereas neuropilin-2 might be required for lymphatic development [50]. In axonal guidance, neuropilins induce signal transduction by associating with plexins. There is currently no evidence that neuropilins exert a direct signalling function in endothelial cells; instead neuropilins might act by stabilizing the VEGF–VEGFR-2 complex.

The signalling capacity of VEGFR-2 is influenced by the adhesion state of endothelial cells. Vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin) is an endothelial cell-specific adherence junction component that is involved in complex formation with VEGFR-2. The crucial function of this complex is indicated by the fact that elimination of VE-cadherin expression blocks transduction of VEGF-induced signals for cell survival [51]. The VE-cadherin complex includes β-catenin, which is phosphorylated and translocated to the nucleus in VEGF-A-stimulated cells [52,53]. Nuclear β-catenin binds to the T-cell factor or the closely related lymphoid-enhancer factor (TCF/LEF) [54], thereby regulating transcriptional activity of genes that are implicated in the angiogenic response.

Expression, signal transduction and function of VEGFR-3

VEGFR-3 (also known as Flt-4) is a 195-kDa high-affinity receptor for VEGF-C and VEGF-D. Distinct features of

VEGFR-3 includes cleavage during synthesis within the fifth extracellular immunoglobulin loop; the two regulatory polypeptides are kept together by a disulfide bridge [55]. There are two VEGFR-3 splice variants in humans, one short and one long; the latter has a C-terminal extension of 65 amino acids [56,57] that is created by a retroviral insertion [58]. Mouse embryos lacking expression of VEGFR-3 die at embryonal day 9.5 due to deficient vessel remodelling. Larger vessels are disorganized, leading to fluid accumulation and cardiovascular failure [59]. These effects might be owing to a direct loss of VEGFR-3 function or because of an indirect effect caused by an increased availability of VEGF-C and -D for activation of VEGFR-2 [60]. In the adult, VEGFR-3 expression is detected primarily in lymphatic endothelial cells. These cells are physiologically distinct from blood vascular endothelial cells (Fig. 2). Recently, the homeodomain transcription factor Prox-1 has been shown to regulate the lymphatic endothelial cell phenotype [61]. Inactivating point mutations in the VEGFR-3 leads to chronic lymphedema [62]. Blocking VEGFR-3 function by overexpression of a soluble recombinant VEGFR-3 in the skin of transgenic mice leads to regression of lymphatic vessels and features of lymphedema, with no apparent effect on the blood vasculature [63]. The soluble VEGFR-3 also suppresses tumour lymphangiogenesis, with decreased metastasis to regional lymph nodes [64]. In agreement, enhanced VEGFR-3 function by tumour-specific overexpression of VEGF-C in breast cancer, fibrosarcoma and melanoma models, or of VEGF-D in a human embryonic kidney (293EBNA) tumour model, increases lymphangiogenesis and promotes the spread of metastasis [65–67].

VEGFR-3 is, to some extent, expressed on quiescent vascular endothelial cells in capillaries [68] and its expression is induced in proliferating endothelial cells [60], for example, in the granulation tissue of healing wounds, and in the endothelium of human gliomas and colon carcinomas [69].

Activation of VEGFR-3 induces proliferation, migration and survival in lymphatic endothelial cells [61]. The activated VEGFR-3 associates with adaptor proteins Shc and Grb2 via Tyr1337 [55]. Activation of the classical Erk pathway appears to be independent of Ras; instead, PLC-γ/PKC-dependent activation of p42/44 MAPK has been reported. VEGFR-3 activation leads to induction of PI3K and stimulation of Akt/PKB [61], which could be important for lymphatic and blood endothelial cell survival. VEGFR-3 binds both the full length and proteolytically processed forms of VEGF-C and VEGF-D, whereas VEGFR-2 binds the proteolytically processed forms only. Thus, the relative availability of the ligands might indirectly modulate the signal-transduction capacities of the two receptors [70]. The signal-transduction capacity of VEGFR-3 is directly influenced by heterodimeric-complex formation with VEGFR-2 [71]; certain VEGFR-3 phosphorylation sites such as Tyr1337 are not phosphorylated by VEGFR-2, which affects the ability of VEGFR-3 to interact with substrates such as Shc.

Concluding remarks and future perspectives

There has been an intense focus in the past few years on the development of therapies based on modulation of VEGFR function. Gene therapy using VEGF-A to enhance vascularization has been tested in conditions such as cardiovascular diseases and peripheral ischaemia. However, these diseases build up over many decades and the relatively short duration of VEGF expression (e.g. upon adenovirus-mediated delivery) is likely to lead to alleviation of these conditions only temporarily. Moreover, angiogenesis inhibition using VEGFR-2 antagonists has proved more complicated than predicted from studies in mice, and has been plagued by problems, such as, low efficiency, toxicity and unexpected haemorrhage. Inhibition of VEGFR-2 signalling is predicted to be more successful in the treatment of confined vascular disorders such as diabetic retinopathy, which does not involve transformed cells [72]. It is likely that inhibition of tumour angiogenesis will be a useful part of combination therapy in tumour treatment in the future, but insufficient alone. For long-term treatments involving VEGF antagonists, it is important to learn more about VEGFR-expression patterns and non-endothelial cell functions that the receptors might exert. It was recently shown that VEGFR-1-dependent production of hepatocyte growth factor in liver sinusoidal endothelial cells protects against liver toxicity [73].

So what does the future hold for VEGFR research? Clearly, we have identified many of the downstream signalling pathways from the receptors, especially those from VEGFR-2. However, many of these appear to be pathways used by several different growth factors in a range of cell types and important in functions such as migration and proliferation. By contrast, differentiation (i.e. formation of a lumen-containing tube during angiogenesis) might be unique to endothelial cells. Equipped with high quality reagents (e.g. phosphoantibodies against phosphorylation sites in receptors and in signalling molecules) and using models that closely mimic the in vivo situation, it will be possible to pinpoint the role of known signal transducers in this response. Furthermore, using new explorative techniques based on proteomics and microarray, novel proteins and genes regulating endothelial cell differentiation could be identified. Such molecules will constitute new and, potentially, highly specific drug targets for the development of future endothelial cell therapies.
