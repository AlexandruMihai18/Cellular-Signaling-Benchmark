# INTRODUCTION

The concept of "lysosomal storage disorders" was introduced by Hers in 1965 (1) to explain how genetically determined absence of a seemingly unimportant enzyme, α-glucosidase, could lead to the fatal condition known as Pompe disease. The undegraded substrate would gradually accumulate within lysosomes, causing progressive increase in the size and number of these organelles; the cellular pathology would eventually lead to malfunction of the affected organ. This concept quickly led to the discovery of additional lysosomal storage disorders, which at this time number three dozen (Table 1). The majority are caused by deficiency of a single lysosomal enzyme; others, for which I-cell disease is the paradigm, result from pleiotropic loss of several lysosomal enzymes because of an underlying defect in some common protein.

Although the total number of known lysosomal storage diseases has not changed much since the subject was last reviewed in this series (2), research activity in the field has been intense in the intervening years. The 1989 edition of *The Metabolic Basis of Inherited Disease* (3) devotes 300 pages, documented by more than 3500 references, to the topic. The reader is directed in Table 1 to chapters in this compendium and other reviews for detailed accounts of the clinical, pathological, biochemical, genetic, and molecular aspects of individual disorders or classes of related disorders (4–20). The current review concentrates on recent developments in the area of lysosomal enzyme deficiency diseases, and focuses on general issues such as processing of normal and mutant enzymes, the structure of normal and mutant genes, correlation of genotype with phenotype, and development of therapeutic strategies. The interesting areas of transport of small molecules out of lysosomes and genetic defects thereof (20, 20a) are not in the purview of this chapter.

## PROCESSING OF LYSOSOMAL ENZYMES

### Normal Enzymes

**PATHWAYS FOR SOLUBLE AND MEMBRANE-BOUND ENZYMES**  
The pathway of synthesis, transport, and processing of soluble lysosomal enzymes and related proteins is well known and well reviewed (21, 22). Briefly, the early events—insertion into the endoplasmic reticulum, removal of the signal peptide, and N-glycosylation—are the same as for secretory proteins. A reaction specific to soluble proteins destined to lysosomes is acquisition of the mannose 6-phosphate marker for targeting to the organelles (23). The mannose 6-phosphate structure mediates binding to one of two mannose 6-phosphate receptors [one of which, the calcium-independent receptor, is a bifunctional protein, which also serves as the insulin-like growth factor II

receptor (reviewed in 24)]. Association with the receptor occurs in a late Golgi compartment, and dissociation in a prelysosomal acidic compartment. As the system is not fully efficient, a fraction of newly made enzyme is secreted; this can be enhanced in cell culture by amines that raise the pH of acidic compartments, thereby preventing the regeneration of free mannose 6-phosphate receptors. The calcium-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor also participates in endocytosis, bringing in extracellular mannose 6-phosphate--containing enzymes to a prelysosomal compartment through coated pits and vesicles.

Since the function of the mannose 6-phosphate marker is to bind a soluble protein to a membrane receptor, membrane-bound proteins should not require mannose phosphorylation in order to be targeted to lysosomes. It is therefore not surprising that glucocerebrosidase, an enzyme associated with the lysosomal membrane though not a transmembrane protein, does not acquire phosphorylated mannose residues (25). Acid phosphatase has an unusual biosynthetic pathway in that it is synthesized as a transmembrane protein (26, 27), transported to lysosomes via the cell surface (28), and cleaved to a soluble form by the sequential action of a cytoplasmic thiol protease and a lysosomal aspartyl protease (29). Internalization depends on the presence of a tyrosine residue in the cytoplasmic tail (29a); the mannose 6-phosphate pathway is not involved.

**PROCESSING OF CARBOHYDRATE CHAINS** Synthesis of the mannose 6-phosphate structure requires two reactions: transfer of phospho-N-acetylglucosamine from UDPGlcNAc to give a phosphodiester, followed by removal of the GlcNAc to uncover the mannose 6-phosphate monoester (21, 22). The first reaction itself was recently found to occur in two stages: transfer of PGlcNAc to a mannose residue on the α-1,6 branch of a high-mannose oligosaccharide and addition of a second PGlcNAc to the α-1,3 branch, thought to occur in a pre-Golgi compartment and the cis-Golgi, respectively (30, 31). The diesterase reaction takes place in the medial Golgi. Subsequently, some of the high-mannose oligosaccharides, even those bearing phosphate groups, may be further modified to hybrid structures, and those that are not phosphorylated may be modified to the complex type.

The major conceptual question in the synthesis of the mannose 6-phosphate recognition marker—how the PGlcNAc transferase recognizes its substrate among the many glycoproteins that pass through the endoplasmic reticulum—is closer to resolution (32). As lysosomal enzymes do not share linear amino acid sequences, the determinant for PGlcNAc transferase recognition had been suspected to reside in the three-dimensional structure. Kornfeld and coworkers approached the problem by engineering chimeric molecules from parts of two homologous proteins, cathepsin D (lysosomal) and glycosylated

pepsinogen (secretory), of which the three-dimensional structure is known. The simultaneous presence of two noncontiguous portions of cathepsin D was found to be the minimal requirement for recognition by PGlcNAc transferase in an expression system, though additional sites could improve the effectiveness of the chimeric protein as substrate. The current model is that PGlcNAc transferase recognizes a number of topological features on the surface of polypeptides destined for lysosomes, some combination of which is sufficient to produce an identifying signal (32).

Though they do not acquire mannose 6-phosphate, the two membrane-associated enzymes studied do require *N*-glycosylation, as shown by lack of active glucocerebrosidase (33) or acid phosphatase (34) when cells are grown in tunicamycin. In the latter case, the newly made polypeptide was found to aggregate (34). It is likely that glycosylation is necessary for correct folding of the enzyme.

Once in lysosomes, both soluble and membrane-bound enzymes lose some of their carbohydrate by the action of lysosomal exoglycosidases. The deglycosylation may be extensive; for instance, a high-mannose chain that is phosphorylated in newly made β-subunit of β-hexosaminidase (35) is reduced to a single *N*-acetylglucosamine stub in enzyme purified from placenta (36). Trimming of carbohydrate chains does not occur in fibroblasts from patients with deficiency of lysosomal sialidase or β-galactosidase (37–40), and such fibroblasts have been used to show that in the course of their biosynthesis lysosomal enzymes pass through the compartments where galactosylation and sialylation occur (37, 38). The trimming of terminal carbohydrate residues is not necessary for the function of the enzymes.

**PROTEOLYTIC PROCESSING** In addition to removal of the signal peptide in the endoplasmic reticulum, the newly synthesized protein may be subject to additional limited proteolysis during transport or more often after it has reached lysosomes. This process, often called maturation, is generally deduced from changes in migration in polyacrylamide gels under reducing conditions (41, 42). Edman degradation of amino termini of processing intermediates and products can provide precise identification of cleavage sites, as originally applied to cathepsin D (43) and more recently to β-hexosaminidase (39, 44–47). The reduction in size had been interpreted as loss of a segment of the polypeptide, but reexamination of the structure and biosynthesis of the two subunits of β-hexosaminidase showed that the precursors are cleaved internally and that the fragments remain attached by disulfide bonds (47, 48).

Much of this proteolytic processing, like the trimming of oligosaccharides described above, is a consequence of the degradative lysosomal environment and is not required for acquisition of activity; most lysosomal enzymes found

in cell secretions are in precursor form and catalytically active. Proteases, however, are an exception; they are inactive in precursor form and require proteolytic cleavage for activation, as has been shown for cathepsin D (49) and for protective protein/cathepsin, a recently discovered serine protease (50).

A different kind of proteolytic processing has been discovered in the study of a group of small nonenzymatic lysosomal proteins, called “saposins,” that are required for the activity of certain glycolipid hydrolases. A combination of protein sequencing (51), cloning (52–55), and biosynthetic studies (56) has shown that four saposins, of similar sequence but distinct function (although some overlap exists), are carved out of a polyprotein precursor (reviewed in 57). Whether the proteolytic cleavage occurs in lysosomes or in a pre-lysosomal compartment is not yet known.

## Mutant Enzymes

Mutant enzymes, if made at all, often are not processed to the mature lysosomal form, as observed in biosynthetic labeling experiments (41, 58). Excluding I-cell disease and pseudoHurler polydystrophy, in which defective processing of lysosomal enzymes is a consequence of a primary deficiency of phospho-N-acetylglucosamine transferase (19), the processing abnormality usually indicates that the mutant enzyme (or more precisely, the immunologically cross-reactive protein) either failed to reach lysosomes or was unstable in those acidic organelles. In the latter case, the enzyme may be stabilized within lysosomes if the cells are grown in the presence of protease inhibitors such as leupeptin (59, 60). Alternatively, the enzyme may be secreted and recovered from the medium if the cells are incubated in the presence of 10 mM NH₄⁺ (59, 61, 62). But it is not unusual that the mutant enzyme is not secreted even in the presence of NH₄⁺ and that it remains in the cell in the form of an early precursor without mannose 6-phosphate, and in the case of β-hexosaminidase, without formation of heterodimers. It has been suggested that like many other improperly folded proteins (63), such mutant lysosomal enzymes are trapped and degraded within the endoplasmic reticulum (e.g., 64).

# MOLECULAR ANALYSIS OF NORMAL GENES

The cloning and characterization of nearly 20 complementary DNAs (cDNAs) and a half dozen genes encoding lysosomal enzymes have been reported to date. While often undertaken as a prelude to analysis of mutations underlying storage diseases, the study of the normal genes and transcripts has revealed several interesting common features.

# Sequence Homologies

There appear to be no short or long stretches of DNA or amino acid sequence that are specific to lysosomal enzymes. On the other hand, there is strong sequence similarity between lysosomal and nonlysosomal enzymes catalyzing closely related reactions; the similarity may extend to enzymes from lower eukaryotes and even prokaryotes. Lysosomal enzymes therefore belong to families linked by functional and structural relationships and presumably by a common evolutionary origin. As summarized in Table 2, there are families of

<sup>a</sup> Mammalian enzymes are lysosomal unless indicated otherwise.

$\beta$-hexosaminidases, $\beta$-glucuronidases, $\alpha$-galactosidases, $\alpha$-glucosidases, phosphatases, sulfatases, serine proteases, and aspartyl proteases (50, 65–80, 80a, 80b, 81–92). Intramolecular homology of the four saposins within the polyprotein precursor has been mentioned above.

## Promoters

Lysosomal enzymes and lysosomal enzyme deficiency can be found in every type of cell except for the organelle-less mature erythrocyte; it is the tissue specificity of the substrate rather than of the enzyme that determines the tissues affected in lysosomal enzyme deficiency diseases. It is therefore not surprising that genes encoding some human lysosomal enzymes [the $\beta$-subunit of $\beta$-hexosaminidase (69), $\alpha$-glucosidase (80b), acid phosphatase (81), and arylsulfatase A (84)] have regions upstream of the coding sequence that are common to promoters of housekeeping genes: i.e., regions with no TATA box, and with a very high GC content with potential SP1-binding sites (93). On the other hand, the genes for $\alpha$-galactosidase (94), murine $\beta$-glucuronidase (76), and the $\alpha$-subunit of $\beta$-hexosaminidase (67) do have a TATA box within the GC-rich region.

The gene encoding glucocerebrosidase does not conform at all to the housekeeping model; its promoter has a TATA box, no SP1 binding sites, and causes differential expression of a reporter gene in different cell types, similar to the level of expression of endogenous glucocerebrosidase in the same cells (95, 96). However, the level of differential expression should not be extrapolated directly to normal tissues, because transformed and clearly abnormal lines had been used as representative cell types.

## Alternate Transcripts

Evidence for transcripts that may be derived from alternate splicing has been found in the course of cloning cDNA encoding $\beta$-glucuronidase (72), sphingomyelinase (97), $\beta$-galactosidase (98, 99), sulfatide activator (54), and $\alpha$-$N$-acetylgalactosaminidase (100). When expressed in transfected cells, the alternate cDNA specified a protein product that did not have the catalytic activity of the corresponding hydrolase (72, 98) and was not targeted to lysosomes (98). The physiological function of these alternate transcripts, if any, is not known.

# MOLECULAR ANALYSIS OF MUTATIONS

## Heterogeneity of Allelic Mutations

Multiplicity of mutant alleles had long been suspected from the clinical heterogeneity associated with any one lysosomal enzyme deficiency and from differences in the properties of residual enzyme. Later, heterogeneity was

### Inferred from differences in synthesis and processing of the protein, and when probes became available, from differences in Southern or Northern blots. But it has only been in the past few years, as technology for characterizing mutations has become simpler, that extensive heterogeneity has become evident. Though one or a few mutations, often clustered in particular ethnic groups, may account for a significant fraction of patients or carriers (Table 3), a very large number of rare mutations account for the remainder. Thus, patients are likely to be compound heterozygotes (i.e., carry two different mutant alleles); as is seen below, homozygosity can no longer be assumed even for well-defined populations. Mutations observed in specific disorders are presented in some detail, as they illustrate a number of genetic principles.

### Specific Disorders

#### GM2 Gangliosidoses
Three genes are required for the lysosomal degradation of GM2 ganglioside, an important constituent of neuronal membranes—the HEX A and HEX B genes encoding the $\alpha$- and $\beta$-subunits of $\beta$-hexosaminidase, respectively, and the gene encoding the GM2 activator, a lipid-binding protein that presents the GM2 substrate to the enzyme (9). Failure to degrade the glycolipid because of mutation in any of the three genes gives rise to disorders known collectively as the GM2 gangliosidoses.

Mutations in the HEX A gene cause infantile Tay-Sachs disease as well as disorders of later onset and slower course. Historically, Tay-Sachs disease
was found with greatest frequency in the Ashkenazi Jewish and French-Canadian populations, until carrier detection programs greatly reduced its incidence in these groups. The first of the mutations to be characterized was the French-Canadian, a deletion of exon 1 and flanking sequences due to recombination at Alu repetitive sequences (101, 102). Then surprisingly, not one, but two Tay-Sachs mutations were found among Ashkenazi Jews: a base substitution in the conserved donor splice site of intron 12 (103–105) that prevents normal maturation of heterogeneous nuclear RNA (106), and a four-nucleotide insertion in exon 11 that causes premature termination and unstable messenger RNA (mRNA) (107). Analysis of DNA in carriers of enzyme deficiency has shown that the exon 11 insertion accounts for about 70% and the splice site mutation for less than 20% of the Tay-Sachs alleles in the Jewish population (107–109). The insertion also represents a significant proportion of Tay-Sachs alleles in the general population of the United States (109). The less common 269Gly→Ser substitution, which accounts for 3–4% of mutant HEX A alleles (108, 109), gives rise to chronic/adult-onset GM2 gangliosidosis when in compound heterozygosity with one of the infantile alleles (110, 111) or in very rare cases of homozygosity (112). The 269Gly→Ser allele encodes an α-subunit that does not properly dimerize with the β-subunit and yields only a very low level of functional A (αβ) isoenzyme (113).

A rare enzymatic variant of Tay-Sachs disease, called “B1,” was long known for the diagnostic confusion that it caused, as the A (αβ) isoenzyme has the substrate specificity of the B (ββ)—i.e., it hydrolyzes neutral β-hexosaminides but not GM2 ganglioside or a synthetic sulfated substrate. The B1 phenotype can be produced by one of two mutations that change arginine at position 178 of the α-subunit to either histidine (114) or cysteine (115). Since kinetic studies had shown that the α- and β-subunits of the heterodimeric isoenzyme bind acidic and neutral substrates, respectively (116), the apparent change in substrate specificity of B1 can be interpreted as loss of the α-subunit-binding site as a consequence of the amino acid substitution at position 178. Evidence for such an interpretation comes from the catalytically inactive ββ dimer formed when β-subunit, mutagenized at the homologous arginine, is expressed in Cos1 cells (117). These results do not necessarily imply participation of 178Arg in catalysis, as the effect of the mutation might be indirect.

The two B1 mutations occur at a CpG dinucleotide, as do several other amino acid substitutions [170Arg→Gln (118), 482Glu→Lys (119), 499Arg→His (62), 504Arg→His (62)] and a nucleotide deletion in codon 504 causing premature termination (64). CpG dinucleotides are known to be mutagenic hotspots because they are frequent sites of cytosine methylation, and upon spontaneous deamination of methyl cytosine to thymidine may go

unrepaired (120, 120a). Mutations of the HEX A gene also occur elsewhere—e.g., ${}^{420}\mathrm{Trp} \rightarrow \mathrm{Cys}$ (121). In yet another non-CpG mutation, a change of one nucleotide at the 3' end of exon 5 does not change the sense of the codon but interferes with processing of transcripts (122). With two exceptions that cause a juvenile form of $G_{M_2}$ gangliosidosis (arginine to histidine substitutions in codons 499 and 504), all these rare mutations result in infantile forms of Tay-Sachs disease.

A common mutation in the HEX B gene is a deletion of exons 1–5 by recombination at flanking Alu sequences; this deletion accounts for one quarter of the known alleles in Sandhoff disease (123). The deletion mutation does not seem to be enriched in any one ethnic group. Two interesting mutations that create new splice sites in the gene give rise to milder conditions such as juvenile Sandhoff disease or asymptomatic states, depending on the level of residual activity. One is G→A transition at a CpG site in intron 12 (124, 125), the other a duplication of a sequence straddling intron 13 and exon 14 (125). Although the upstream splice sites created by the mutation are used preferentially, the normal splice sites may be used to a very small extent, permitting the formation of some normal β-subunit (125).

The cDNA encoding the $G_{M_2}$ activator protein (genetically unrelated to the polyprotein saposin activators) has been cloned, but mutation analysis has not yet been reported (126).

**GAUCHER DISEASE** Gaucher disease is caused by deficiency of glucocerebrosidase (also called glucosylceramidase or acid β-glucosidase) and the resulting accumulation of glucosylceramide; it is the most common of the lysosomal storage diseases, with the highest frequency encountered in the Ashkenazi Jewish population (6, 7). In this ethnic group, the disease is of the Type 1 variety, affecting primarily the reticuloendothelial system; the much rarer but more widely distributed Types 2 and 3 (infantile and juvenile neuronopathic forms, respectively) affect the nervous system as well (6, 7). The major mutation in the non-neuronopathic form, ${}^{370}\mathrm{Asn} \rightarrow \mathrm{Ser}$, accounts for three quarters of the Gaucher alleles among Ashkenazi Jewish patients (127–129) and is found also in non-Jewish patients with Type 1 Gaucher disease (130). This allele encodes an enzyme with reduced specific activity and other abnormal properties, as seen in studies of patients' enzyme and in expression of mutagenized cDNA in transfected Sf9 cells (131). The ${}^{370}\mathrm{Asn} \rightarrow \mathrm{Ser}$ allele may be found in Type 1 patients in homozygous form or in compound heterozygous form; it is not seen in patients with neuronopathic disease, showing that the residual activity is sufficient to protect against the most severe manifestations of the disease. The ${}^{370}\mathrm{Asn} \rightarrow \mathrm{Ser}$ mutation in Ashkenazi Jews is linked to a PvuII polymorphism in intron 6 (132).

The second most common mutation is ${}^{444}\mathrm{Leu} \rightarrow \mathrm{Pro}$, which is found in all

three disease types, but causes neuronopathic disease in homozygous form (133, 134). The altered amino acid is in the catalytic domain of glucocerebrosidase, which had been identified previously by reaction with the substrate analog, conduritol B epoxide (135).

A unique feature of glucocerebrosidase genetics is the existence of a pseudogene that is in close proximity to the functional gene and that lacks Alu sequences in four introns, has a deletion in exon 9, and has a number of nucleotide changes scattered throughout (136). Several Gaucher alleles have been found to differ from the normal allele in as many as four codons, which are similar to their counterpart in the pseudogene. These complex alleles have been identified as chimeric molecules, part functional gene and part pseudogene, that could have been formed by gene conversion or unequal crossing over (137–140). The 444Leu→Pro mutation is also present in the pseudogene, and some of the alleles carrying this mutation were subsequently shown to be of the complex type. Homozygosity for 444Leu→Pro alone appears to cause a somewhat milder neurodegenerative disease than a combination with a complex allele (138).

A number of additional rare mutations, all amino acid substitutions, have been described and are reviewed in Ref. 7. In contrast to the profusion of CpG mutations in the HEX A gene, only 2 of 13 point mutations in the glucocerebrosidase gene are at CpG sites.

One instance of Gaucher disease with deficiency of an activator protein (variously known as coglucosidase, sulfatide activator 2, or saposin C) rather than of glucocerebrosidase has been reported (141). Further studies of this disorder would be of great interest, as they would clarify the physiological roles of two activator proteins (saposins A and C) that can stimulate glucocerebrosidase activity in vitro (57).

**METACHROMATIC LEUKODYSTROPHY** Metachromatic leukodystrophy is caused by failure to degrade cerebroside sulfate (sulfatide), a component of myelin. Except for an unusually high frequency in the small isolate of Habbanite Jews in Israel, it is panethnic. The storage disease may be caused by deficiency of the enzyme, arylsulfatase A (cerebroside sulfatase), or of the sulfatide activator protein (11).

Two mutant alleles of the arylsulfatase A gene have been found to predominate among patients with metachromatic leukodystrophy (142). An allele common among adult-onset patients carries a 426Pro→Leu substitution that permits some residual activity. A different allele common among patients with the late infantile form of the disease has been found to carry two mutations: a 193Trp→Cys substitution and a nucleotide substitution in the donor splice site of intron 2; transfection experiments showed that the amino acid substitution was innocuous and that loss of activity was caused by the

splice site mutation (142). Some patients with the juvenile form of the disease have the adult and late infantile mutations in compound heterozygosity (142). By analogy with findings in other disorders, the remainder of mutations causing metachromatic leukodystrophy are likely to be heterogeneous.

Biochemical diagnosis and heterozygote detection for metachromatic leukodystrophy are complicated by the common occurrence of a “pseudodeficiency” allele that specifies a product with very low enzymatic activity but does not cause disease (143, 144). The pseudodeficient enzyme has only one of the two normal glycosylation sites, but mutagenesis and transfection experiments showed that this change was of no consequence (145). The cause of the enzyme deficiency proved to be a base change in the consensus polyadenylation site; the large transcripts made by use of alternate polyadenylation sites are relatively unstable and give rise to only small amounts of polyadenylated mRNA (145).

Metachromatic leukodystrophy may also be caused by deficiency of saposin B, variously known as sulfatide activator protein or sphingolipid activator 1 (11, 57). Although saposin B stimulates the hydrolysis in vitro of several glycolipids by their respective hydrolases, its physiological function must reside in the degradation of cerebroside sulfate, the only glycolipid to accumulate in the deficiency state. Two mutations affecting this protein have been identified. One is a substitution of isoleucine for threonine, obliterating a glycosylation site and possibly exposing the saposin to proteolytic degradation at a nearby arginine residue (146, 146a). The other is a 33-nucleotide insertion into mRNA between nucleotides 777 and 778, counting from the initiation codon of the saposin polyprotein precursor (147). Some normal individuals also have the nine downstream nucleotides of the insertion, probably due to alternate splicing (54, 146a, 147).

FABRY DISEASE Deficiency of α-galactosidase causes accumulation of glycosphingolipids with terminal α-galactosyl residues, primarily in capillary walls (4). The disease is one of two lysosomal storage disorders to have a locus on the X-chromosome (Hunter syndrome is the other). A number of mutations have been characterized, including amino acid substitution [³⁵⁶Arg → Trp (148), ³⁰¹Arg → Gln (149)], premature termination (149), and major rearrangements to which the α-galactosidase gene appears especially prone (148, 150, 151). Although the gene is rich in Alu repetitive elements, only one of the rearrangements involves recombination at Alu sites; the remainder, mostly deletions but also a duplication, have been attributed to slipped mispairing of short direct repeats (150).

GALACTOSIALIDOSIS The combined deficiency of β-galactosidase and sialidase, known as galactosialidosis, is a distinct clinical and biochemical

entity caused by deficiency of yet another lysosomal protein, which is required for protecting the activity of the two glycosidases (152). Stabilization of β-galactosidase and activation of sialidase is achieved by association of the three proteins into a multimeric complex (153–155). As the sequence of the cDNA encoding this “protective protein” was found to be similar to that of the yeast serine proteases, carboxypeptidase Y and KEX 1, the protective protein was predicted to be a protease (91), and was found to react with diisopropylfluorophosphate (50). Examination of its substrate specificity suggested that the “protective protein” was a lysosomal carboxypeptidase [carboxypeptidase L (156)] and was identical to cathepsin A (A. d’Azzo, personal communication). However, its function in protecting the glycosidases in the complex is distinct from its function as a cathepsin (A. d’Azzo, personal communication). In another development in this intriguing story, a newly characterized deamidase has been found to be closely related to the protective protein/cathepsin (157).

Analysis of mutations in galactosialidosis and of the consequences thereof should clarify the role of this potentially multifunctional protein.

**OTHER DISORDERS** Characterization of mutations has begun for many other lysosomal storage disorders. One fifth of fucosidosis patients have been found to carry a mutant allele of the gene encoding α-L-fucosidase, in which a nucleotide substitution creates a stop at codon 442, 120 nucleotides upstream of the normal termination site (158, 159; K. A. Kretz, personal communication). A<sup>163</sup>Cys→Ser substitution in the cDNA encoding aspartylglycosaminidase has been found among Finnish patients with aspartylglycosaminuria (159a). Heterogeneity, identified at the level of Northern or Southern analysis, has been reported for α-glucosidase deficiency, Pompe disease (160, 161), as well as for iduronate sulfatase deficiency (Hunter syndrome) (66); in the latter case, complete deletion of the gene has been observed in some patients (66). Precise analysis of mutations are anticipated in the near future for these disorders, as well as for the many other lysosomal storage disorders for which cloned probes are or soon will be available.

**Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**

Clinical heterogeneity is characteristic of lysosomal storage disorders, most of which display a spectrum ranging from very severe to relatively benign. It seems intuitively reasonable to assume that the more profound the enzyme deficiency, the more severe the disorder, and conversely, the higher the residual activity of the mutant enzyme, the greater the protection against disease. The level of activity needed to protect against the most severe manifestations of a disease may be a small fraction of the normal level and perhaps difficult to measure by standard enzyme assays. Conzelmann &

Sandhoff (162) have provided a formal kinetic treatment of this concept. Their model proposes a "critical threshold" of activity, above which the enzyme is capable of keeping up with substrate influx and below which it cannot keep up and accumulation of undegraded substrate occurs. The critical threshold and the rate of accumulation can differ between cells (e.g., between subsets of neurons), or between the same cells at different times in development, depending on the rate of influx of the substrate. Thus, a very small difference in residual activity can markedly affect the age of onset of the disease, the rate of progression, and the symptomatology. Experimental verification of this model showed a good inverse correlation of residual activity of β-hexosaminidase A and arylsulfatase A with severity of G<sub>M2</sub> gangliosidosis and metachromatic leukodystrophy, respectively (P. Leinekugel, S. Michel, E. Conzelmann, and K. Sandhoff, unpublished results).

Because of implications for prognosis and counseling of carriers, a major objective of mutation analysis has been to correlate the nature of the mutation with the clinical manifestations of the disease. The multiplicity of mutant alleles discussed above means that many or perhaps most patients have a combination of two different alleles. Alleles that cause total loss of enzyme activity can be expected to be very heterogeneous, as there are innumerable ways to prevent the formation of functional enzyme, and to cause severe disease in any combination. On the other hand, mutations that permit some function are expected to be limited in number, as the residual phenotype is itself selective, and to cause a milder disease. There appears to be some dose dependence for the milder alleles: homozygotes for the <sup>370</sup>Asn→Ser glucocerebrosidase allele (129, 163), for the <sup>269</sup>Gly→Ser HEX A allele (112, 163a), and for the <sup>426</sup>Pro→Leu arylsulfatase A allele (142) are likely to have a somewhat milder form of Type I Gaucher disease, adult G<sub>M2</sub> gangliosidosis, and late-onset metachromatic leukodystrophy, respectively, than individuals who carry these same alleles in compound heterozygosity with alleles for the severe form of the disease.

However, current correlations of genotype and clinical presentation are imperfect; for instance, juvenile as well as adult-onset metachromatic leukodystrophy may result from homozygosity of <sup>426</sup>Pro→Leu (142), and the homozygosity for the <sup>444</sup>Leu→Pro mutation, generally associated with the neuronopathic form of Gaucher disease, has been found among Japanese patients with the non-neuronopathic form (164). Such discrepancies emphasize that the consequences of specific mutations can be modulated by unknown variables, some of which, such as infections or use of lysosomotropic drugs, might be environmental. Caution should be exercised in predicting clinical outcome from genotype, particularly with novel combinations of alleles.

# PROSPECTS FOR THERAPY

The discovery of lysosomal storage disease was accompanied by the suggestion that this class of disorders could be treated by administration of exogenous enzymes, which would find their way to lysosomes by the process of endocytosis (1). Hopes were raised by the ease with which storage could be reduced in cell culture (2). Numerous experiments were conducted in the 1960s and 1970s, in which purified enzymes, or plasma and leukocytes as sources of enzymes, were administered to patients with lysosomal storage diseases, particularly mucopolysaccharidoses (14). The results were generally disappointing, in part because only minute amounts of enzyme were administered and in part because the need for signals for receptor-mediated endocytosis was not yet appreciated. Both problems were addressed in a recent study of enzyme replacement for patients with Type 1 Gaucher disease (165). Glucocerebrosidase, which normally carries complex oligosaccharide chains, was modified after purification to expose terminal mannose residues; these allow the enzyme to bind to the mannose receptors present on the surface of reticulo-endothelial cells (166), which are specifically affected in Type 1 Gaucher disease. The modified enzyme was administered in substantial quantity over a two-year period, with significant clinical benefit. This promising report suggests that enzyme replacement, carried out on an appropriate scale and with due consideration to receptor-mediated endocytosis in target cells, remains a viable concept for therapy of lysosomal storage disease.

Because of the failure of early attempts at enzyme replacement, other alternatives have been pursued, including bone marrow transplantation, even though lysosomal storage disorders are not specific to blood cells. The underlying hypothesis is that cells derived from hematopoietic progenitors of the donor (circulating leukocytes and tissue macrophages) can donate lysosomal enzyme to the deficient cells in all tissues of the host, either through secretion or direct cell-cell interaction. Both biochemical and clinical benefit has been observed in some patients, mainly with Hurler or Maroteaux-Lamy syndrome, who received allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (167, 168). Better controlled experiments than would be possible with human patients have been performed in animals with lysosomal storage disease. Bone marrow transplantation was shown to have significant positive effects in dogs with α-L-iduronidase deficiency, including decrease in glycosaminoglycan storage in all organs examined and a much slower progression of disease symptoms (169, 170). Clinical amelioration was also seen in dogs with fucosidosis, especially if the transplantation was performed at a very young age (171, 172), and in a cat with arylsulfatase B deficiency (173). Beneficial effects on neuronal pathology have been found in the twitcher mouse, which

has a galactocerebrosidase deficiency analogous to Krabbe disease in the human; the blood-brain barrier is believed to have been crossed by donor-derived macrophages (174). On the other hand, bone marrow transplantation had no effect on the progression of neurological disease in dogs with G<sub>M1</sub> gangliosidosis (175).

But even at best, the benefits of bone marrow transplantation are modest, while the risks and cost of the procedure are very great. However, its limited success has encouraged the prospect of gene replacement through transfection of hematopoietic progenitor cells. Retroviral vectors containing human glucocerebrosidase cDNA have been used to express glucocerebrosidase in culture fibroblasts (176, 177) and hematopoietic cells (178) from Gaucher patients. Mouse hematopoietic progenitor cells transfected with human glucocerebrosidase cDNA in a retroviral vector expressed the human enzyme both in long-term culture (179) and after transplantation into mice (180). These results seem particularly promising for eventual gene replacement in Gaucher disease Type 1, which affects bone marrow-derived cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage.

A retroviral vector carrying a rat cDNA encoding β-glucuronidase was used to correct the deficiency in both human and canine fibroblasts deficient in that enzyme, as well as in retinal epithelial cells and hematopoietic cells derived from the deficient dog (181). Finally, insertion of the human β-glucuronidase gene into the germ line of a mouse model for complete β-glucuronidase deficiency resulted in the expression of human β-glucuronidase in all tissues of a transgenic animal, and a completely normal phenotype even though the animal was a homozygote for the murine deficiency disease (182). This study illustrates the value of mouse models with total enzyme deficiency, which could serve as background for the insertion of mutant human genes to create better models of human disease for testing novel therapies.

# CONCLUDING REMARKS

Over the past five years, molecular studies have expanded our understanding of lysosomal enzymes and their genes both in the normal state and in lysosomal storage diseases. The limiting step in this progress has been the initial purification of the enzymes to homogeneity, in order to obtain antibodies as well as partial sequence for cloning cDNA. Some lysosomal enzymes, mainly those that are membrane-bound, have resisted attempts at purification and may require different cloning strategies.

Numerous disease-producing mutations in genes encoding lysosomal enzymes have been characterized, including deletions, insertions, splice site and polyadenylation site alterations, and missense and nonsense mutations. Illegitimate recombination at Alu repetitive sequences and other sites, recombination of gene and pseudogene sequences (for glucocerebrosidase), and base

changes at CpG dinucleotides appear to be frequent mechanisms of mutagenesis. Heterogeneity of mutant alleles appears to be the rule for every lysosomal storage disease studied to date, although one or a small number of alleles may be widely distributed in particular populations, due to founder effect or selection. Patients are therefore likely to carry two different mutant alleles, the combination of which must be considered in order to understand the manifestations of the disease.

A true understanding of the effect of mutations on the transport and function of lysosomal enzymes has been hampered by lack of information about their three-dimensional structure. As a result of their residence in the degradative organelles, lysosomal enzymes purified from tissues tend to be nicked and partially deglycosylated, and thus too heterogeneous for crystallization. The problem will no doubt be remedied in the next few years by the development of overexpressing cell lines that can secrete large quantities of lysosomal enzymes in intact form and in quantities sufficient for structural studies.

The ability to produce large quantities of lysosomal enzymes by recombinant DNA technology should also encourage new attempts at enzyme replacement. The recombinant enzymes can be modified chemically or enzymatically to enhance their receptor-mediated entry into target cells. This approach can be expected to proceed in parallel with the development of gene replacement via retroviral vectors, for which certain lysosomal storage disorders are considered to be good candidates. The existing animal models of lysosomal storage disorders, and perhaps new mouse models created by gene disruption, should be invaluable for such therapeutic endeavors.
