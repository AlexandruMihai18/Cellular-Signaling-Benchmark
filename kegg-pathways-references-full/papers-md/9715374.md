## I. Introduction

It is now well established that the secretion of insulin by pancreatic β-cells is regulated primarily by the circulating concentrations of nutrient secretagogues, including glucose, fatty acids, and some amino acids, and that these agents are unusual among endocrine stimuli because they influence the secretory process as a result of their metabolism within β-cells rather than by actions at cell surface receptors. Nutrient stimuli are responsible for initiating insulin secretion from β-cells, but nutrient-induced secretory responses can be radically modified by nonnutrient secretagogues. These include a wide variety of hormones and neurotransmitters that act at specific cell surface receptors that are linked, via GTP-binding proteins, to intracellular effector systems. Coupling from receptors to effectors through G proteins in β-cells appears to be similar in all important respects to that reported in other tissues, and there have been many excellent reviews of this area recently (1–4).

The mechanisms through which β-cells recognize nutrient and nonnutrient stimuli have been studied in detail. These mechanisms and their relative importance in the generation and maintenance of physiologically relevant secretory responses have been reviewed extensively elsewhere (5–8). In general, both classes of secretagogues control the secretory process by modifying the concentration or availability of a number of intracellular regulators within β-cells, including Ca²⁺, cyclic nucleotides, and products of phospholipid hydrolysis. Over the past few years, considerable advances have been made in our understanding of the mechanisms controlling the generation and actions of intracellular regulators within β-cells, and this subject has been the topic of some excellent and comprehensive reviews (7, 9–15). In brief, it is now generally accepted that the metabolism of glucose and other nutrient secretagogues within the β-cell results in the closure of ATP-sensitive K⁺ (K<sub>ATP</sub>) channels in the plasma membrane, leading to depolarization of the cell, with a consequent influx of extracellular Ca²⁺ through voltage-sensitive channels (reviewed in Ref. 16). Although useful, this electrophysiological model does not fully describe β-cell secretory responses to nutrients. Not all of the effects of nutrient secretagogues on insulin secretion can be explained by closure of K<sub>ATP</sub> channels (17, 18), and it is important to note that nutrients also elevate intracellular concentrations of cAMP, and of regulators derived from membrane phospholipids, including inositol trisphosphate (IP₃), diacylglycerols (DAG), arachidonic acid (AA), and phosphatidic acid. Evidence is also accumulating for Ca²⁺-independent mechanisms through which β-cells recognize and respond to glucose (19), although it is still too early to determine the physiological importance of this pathway(s).

Despite the differences in their mechanisms of recognition by β-cells, receptor-mediated, nonnutrient insulin secretagogues influence the secretory process through the same intracellular regulators as do nutrient secretagogues. For example, cholinergic muscarinic agonists, such as carbachol (CCh), stimulate β-cell depolarization and Ca²⁺ influx (20); CCh and peptide hormones such as bombesin, cholecystokinin (CCK), and arginine vasopressin (AVP) activate phospholipase C (PLC) with the subsequent generation of IP₃ and DAG from inositol phospholipids (21–25); CCh also activates phospholipase A₂ (PLA₂), which hydrolyzes phosphatidylcholine to generate AA and lysophospholipids (26); glucagon, glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP),

and pituitary adenylate cyclase (AC)-activating polypeptide (PACAP) stimulate AC to produce elevations in β-cell cAMP (27–29), whereas α₂-adrenoreceptor agonists, somatostatin and galanin, inhibit AC and reduce intracellular cAMP (reviewed in Ref. 30).

Although these intracellular regulators have been implicated in the control of insulin secretion, the mechanisms through which changes in their concentrations produce a controlled secretory response are not yet well understood. In this review we will examine whether the ability of the intracellular regulators to control the activity of protein kinases, and thus the phosphorylation state (and function) of intracellular proteins, could provide a common transduction mechanism for these diverse signals. This has been an area of sporadically active β-cell research since the early 1970s (31), but one that is singularly lacking in comprehensive reviews. For this reason, our coverage of the topic has been deliberately broad. We first review the available information on the occurrence and characteristics of regulated protein kinases in pancreatic β-cells (Section II and Table 1) and compile the disparate data on the protein substrates for the kinases in β-cells (Section III and Table 2). We then consider the evidence for and against the involvement of particular kinase and phosphatase activities in insulin-secretory responses (Sections IV and V) and discuss the hypothesis that protein kinase activation is an essential step in stimulus-secretion coupling in β-cells.

minor classes of kinases with different substrate specificities. There have been many detailed studies on the roles played by particular serine/threonine kinases in β-cell stimulus-response coupling pathways, but the occurrence, regulation, or functions of β-cell tyrosine kinases have received attention only in recent years.

The main purpose of the pancreatic β-cell is to synthesize and secrete insulin, so most attention has naturally been paid to those kinases that may be involved in the insulin-secretory process. Since little is yet known about the substrate specificity of these kinases in β-cells, it is common (and useful) to classify them on the basis of their activators, rather than on the more biochemically correct basis of their substrate specificity. Thus, several distinct classes of protein kinases whose activities can be modified by Ca²⁺, cyclic nucleotides, and products of phospholipid hydrolysis have been identified both in islets of Langerhans and in insulin-secreting cell lines, and these are summarized in Table 1. The kinase activities that have been identified in β-cells to date are similar (or identical) to enzymes that have been studied in much more detail in other tissues. The expression, structure, and regulation of these enzymes have been reviewed in detail elsewhere (35, 41–46). The present review will therefore consider only the available information about the occurrence and characteristics of kinase activities in insulin-secretory tissues and the physiological relevance of these enzymes to the control of insulin secretion.

A. Ca²⁺/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases

A number of serine/threonine kinases are dependent upon the presence of Ca²⁺ and the Ca²⁺-binding protein, calmodulin (CaM), for their activation. Ca²⁺/CaM-dependent protein kinase activity in hamster insulinoma cells has been shown to phosphorylate endogenous substrates on serine and/or threonine residues (47), and β-cells are currently known to contain at least three types of Ca²⁺/CaM-dependent protein kinase. Myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) has been reported to be present in rat insulinoma cells (48), HIT cells (49), and in islets isolated from rat (50) and human (49, 51) pancreas. β-cell MLCK has been identified as an

II. Protein Kinases in β-Cells: Expression and Characteristics

Over the past decade the application of molecular biology techniques has led to the identification of a bewildering variety of protein kinases in eukaryotic cells (32–40). The majority of these can be classified as either phosphotransferases with a protein alcohol group as the phosphate acceptor, which are known as serine/threonine kinases, or as phosphotransferases with a protein phenolic group as acceptor, known as tyrosine kinases, although there are other

enzyme that catalyzes the phosphorylation of exogenous myosin light chains with affinities for Ca^{2+} [affinity constant (K_a) = 10 μM], CaM (K_a = 2 nM), myosin light chains [Michaelis-Menton constant (K_m) = 70 μM], and ATP (K_m = 70 μM), and a susceptibility to inhibition by trifluoperazine [TFP, inhibition constant (K_i) = 10 μM], which are similar to those reported for MLCK isolated from other tissues. Two other Ca^{2+}/CaM-dependent protein kinases (CaMK), distinct from MLCK, have been identified in rat islets (52–55) and human islets (49, 51).

A study comparing islet CaMK activity with the multifunctional CaMK II enzyme purified from rat brain demonstrated that islet CaMK consists of two distinct activities,

which have been identified as CaMK II and CaMK III (55). Of the three Ca^{2+}/CaM-dependent kinase activities identified in β-cells, the multifunctional CaMK II is most likely to subserve a role in β-cell stimulus-secretion coupling, since both CaMK III and MLCK are thought to be dedicated to the regulation of a single function (42): MLCK preferentially phosphorylates myosin light chains, while the CaMK III activity in rat islets specifically phosphorylates elongation factor 2, a protein of 102 kDa molecular mass, which is not a substrate for other Ca^{2+}/CaM kinases (55), as has been reported previously for brain CaMK III (56, 57).

Islet CaMK II and that found in MIN6 insulinoma cells is similar to, and perhaps identical with, CaMK II purified from

rat brain (55, 58), and this enzyme is responsible for the CaMK activity that is associated with a particulate (190,000 × g) fraction (49) that has been identified as microsomal membranes (53, 54). Because of the difficulties inherent in the purification to homogeneity of enzymes from limited quantities of islets, little detailed information is available about the physical characteristics of β-cell CaMK II. However, since it is known to be very similar to brain CaMK II (55), islet CaMK II probably exists as a holoenzyme of approximately 550 kDa molecular mass, consisting of a number (8–10) of subunits, each of which contain both regulatory and catalytic activity. CaMK II autophosphorylates on several serine and threonine residues in the presence of Ca²⁺ and CaM (41), and the 53- to 55-kDa substrates for CaMK II reported in many studies (see Table 2) are likely to be subunits of the CaMK II holoenzyme, as discussed in Section III.B. Four independent genes coding for α-, β-, γ-, and δ- isoforms of CaMK II, and corresponding splice variants, have been identified in a variety of tissues. All four isoforms (α, β₃, γβ, γε, and δ₂) have been detected in islets (59–62), with the α-isoform reported to be localized to rat islet microsomes (61) and the δ₂-isoform to β-cell-secretory granules (62). Intriguingly, there has been a report of the expression of a truncated γ-isoform of CaMK II in human islets, which is likely to be regulated in the same manner as the holoenzyme but to exist as a monomer because it lacks an association domain (63). The functional significance of the truncation has not been established, but the expression of the truncated CaMK II may be important for targeting the enzyme (63).

### B. Cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinases

cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) was first isolated from rat and guinea-pig islets of Langerhans by Mon- tague and Howell (64, 65) and shown by gel filtration to be a protein of apparent molecular mass 180 kDa which, in the presence of cAMP, dissociated into a catalytic subunit of 75 kDa and a regulatory subunit of 90 kDa. The PKA activity in extracts of rat islets was stimulated by prior treatment of the islets with agents known to increase intracellular cAMP, including glucagon and a variety of methylxanthine phosphodiesterase inhibitors (66). This PKA activity was mainly associated with a postmicrosomal supernatant fraction and had similar characteristics to PKA activity in other tissues, with a Kₐ for cAMP of ~0.01 μM, a Kₘ for ATP of 11 μM, and a pH optimum of 6.2 (65). PKA activity in homogenates of rat islets of Langerhans was confirmed as being found in the 100,000 × g supernatant fluid (67), while PKA activity in a hamster transplantable islet cell tumor was also found predominantly (70–80%) in the postmicrosomal supernatant fraction and consisted of a regulatory subunit of approximate molecular mass 90 kDa and a catalytic subunit of 33 kDa (68). In contrast, the results of other studies suggested that a significant proportion of islet PKA was associated with either the plasma membrane (69) or with the secretory granule fraction (70, 71), perhaps suggestive of a role in exocytosis. Although these initial studies produced no evidence for the existence of PKA isoforms in islets, a subsequent detailed study demonstrated that two isoforms of PKA could be identified in extracts of rat islets after separation by chromatography on diethylaminoethyl-cellulose (72). The two isoforms found in rat islets were identified as type I and type II PKA by their differential susceptibility to dissociation into regulatory and catalytic subunits (73). The PKA in rat islet homogenates had a calculated molecular mass of 144 kDa, a Kₐ for cAMP of 0.08 μM, and a Kₘ for exogenous histone IIA of 0.08 mg/ml (72). The type I and type II isoforms purified from rat islets on diethylaminoethyl-cellulose had Kₘ values for ATP of 16.1 μM and 15.4 μM, respectively (72). In a later study, photoaffinity labeling of islet proteins using [³H]azido-cAMP identified a cytosolic cAMP-binding protein of apparent molecular mass 54 kDa (74). This protein was tentatively identified as the regulatory subunit of type II PKA, since it had an isoelectric point (pl) of 5.0–5.5, was itself a substrate for cAMP-induced phosphorylation, and was found to be part of a native complex of approximate molecular mass 180 kDa (74). There are at least four different types of regulatory subunit (RIα, RIβ, RIIα, RIIβ) and three catalytic subunits (Ca, Cβ, Cy) that are expressed in a tissue-specific manner. To date, there is no information about which isoforms of the regulatory and catalytic subunits are expressed in β-cells, although it seems likely that they will express RIα, RIIα, and Ca since these are found in all tissues examined (43, 44). The subcellular localization of PKA is dependent upon the type of R subunit in the holoenzyme. Both types of RI subunit are primarily cytosolic, so type I PKA is a cytosolic enzyme. In contrast, RII subunits can interact with specific binding proteins located on intracellular membranes, and type II PKA can thus be associated with plasma, nuclear, and secretory granule membranes (44, 75).

It therefore seems likely that, in common with many other cell types, pancreatic β-cells contain two isoforms of PKA, each of which comprises a holoenzyme of two regulatory (R) subunits and two catalytic (C) subunits. Under resting conditions the phosphorylating activity of the catalytic subunits is inhibited by association with the regulatory subunits. Increased availability of cAMP results in its binding to the regulatory subunits causing a dissociation of the holoenzyme into a R₂·cAMP₄ dimer and two free active catalytic subunits. A subsequent decrease in the concentration of cAMP will favor dissociation of cAMP from the regulatory subunits, the reassociation of regulatory and catalytic subunits, and the resultant inhibition of catalytic activity.

Cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinases (PKG) have been isolated from several mammalian tissues, although the level of PKG activity is generally much lower than that of PKA (76). Islets of Langerhans contain guanylate cyclase and cyclic GMP (77), but the regulation of guanylate cyclase by insulin secretagogues and the importance of cyclic GMP in the control of insulin secretion are matters of some debate (see Section IV.B). Whatever signaling function cyclic GMP serves in islets, it may act through protein phosphorylation since a PKG has been identified in rat islets on the basis of cyclic GMP-dependent phosphorylation of exogenous arginine-rich histone (78). Separation of islet cyclic nucleotide-dependent kinase activities on Sephadex G-200 columns produced three peaks of enzyme activity, one of which had a much greater affinity for cyclic GMP than for cAMP (Kₐ values of 0.05 μM and 1.2 μM, respectively) (78). Our mea-

measurements of cyclic GMP-dependent phosphorylation by $\beta$-cell extracts demonstrated a component that was not inhibited by the PKA-selective inhibitor, PKI$_{6-22}$, and that we therefore attribute to PKG activity. The PKG activity in these experiments was 2.9 ± 0.04 pmol/10$^6$ cells/min, and represented 9.3% of the total cyclic nucleotide-dependent kinase activity in the $\beta$-cell extracts (our unpublished results).

### C. Ca$^{2+}$/phospholipid-dependent protein kinases

The family of Ca$^{2+}$/phospholipid-dependent protein kinases known as protein kinase C (PKC) appears to be ubiquitous in mammalian tissues (reviewed in Refs. 45, 79, and 80), and is composed of isoforms that can be classified into three groups: those that are Ca$^{2+}$-dependent (conventional isoforms: $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$), those that are Ca$^{2+}$-independent (novel isoforms: $\delta$, $\epsilon$, $\eta$, $\theta$), and those that are Ca$^{2+}$-independent and do not bind DAG or phorbol esters (atypical isoforms: $\zeta$, $\iota/\lambda$, $\mu$). PKC in islets of Langerhans (81, 82) and in insulin-secreting cell lines (82, 83) was originally identified as a Ca$^{2+}$-dependent protein kinase that required the presence of an acidic phospholipid, such as phosphatidylserine (PS), for its activation. The sensitivity of conventional isoforms of PKC to activation by Ca$^{2+}$ is greatly increased by the presence of DAGs, or by tumor-promoting phorbol esters that substitute for DAG. Studies using exogenous histone as a phosphorylation substrate for the overall activities of Ca$^{2+}$/DAG-sensitive PKC isoforms expressed in insulin-secreting cells (82, 84) suggested that $\beta$-cell PKC has similar characteristics to those reported for other tissues (see Refs. 79 and 80 for references) with a K$_m$ for ATP of 10 $\mu$M, K$_a$ for Ca$^{2+}$ of 3.9–10 $\mu$M, K$_a$ for PS of 12–18 $\mu$g/ml, K$_a$ for diolein of 2.5 $\mu$g/ml, and K$_m$ for histone HI of 0.5 $\mu$M. PKC purified from rat islets also shows a Ca$^{2+}$-dependent activation in the presence of micromolar concentrations of AA (85, 86) and a variety of other cis-unsaturated fatty acids (87). Under unstimulated conditions, DAG/PS/Ca$^{2+}$-sensitive PKC activity is mainly associated with a cytosolic fraction in islets (88–90) or insulin-secreting cells (91,92).

The activation of DAG-sensitive PKC isoforms is usually accompanied by translocation, involving a redistribution of enzyme activity from a predominantly cytosolic form to a membrane-associated form (93), and there have been several reports of the translocation of activated PKC in islets, $\beta$-cells, and insulin-secreting cell lines (e.g., Refs. 88–91 and 94–97). There is little information about the identity of the membrane compartments to which PKC isoforms translocate upon activation in $\beta$-cells. PKC activity has been demonstrated to form a Ca$^{2+}$-dependent, reversible association with insulin-containing secretory granules (83), and activated PKC-$\delta$ forms transient associations with the $\beta$-cell cytoskeleton (97). An immunocytochemical study suggested that glucose stimulated the translocation of PKC-$\alpha$ from the cytoplasm to a periplasma membrane location (95), and a more recent study using confocal fluorescence microscopy has demonstrated glucose-induced redistribution of PKC-$\alpha$ and -$\epsilon$ to the periphery of islet cells, while PKC-$\delta$ and -$\zeta$ translocated to perinuclear sites (98). Work in other cell types suggests that the targeting of PKC isoforms to particular membranes is due to the subcellular localization of specific anchoring proteins

known as receptors for activated C-kinase (RACKs) (38). Nothing is yet known about RACK expression in $\beta$-cells, although peptides derived from the RACK binding sites of PKC isoforms are reported to inhibit stimulus-dependent translocation of PKC isoforms in rat islets (98). The kinase-anchoring protein interaction may offer another target for the pharmacological modification of kinase function, and thus of insulin secretion.

In many tissues the activation and translocation of PKC are followed by its proteolytic cleavage by membrane-associated, Ca$^{2+}$-activated neutral proteases (99), and this mechanism is responsible for the down-regulation of cellular PKC activity by prolonged exposure to PKC-activating phorbol esters (reviewed in Ref. 80). Similar mechanisms appear to exist in pancreatic $\beta$-cells since there have been several demonstrations that phorbol esters down-regulate PKC activity in islets (100–104) and insulin-secreting cell lines (91,92), and that down-regulation of islet PKC can be inhibited by preventing the activation of Ca$^{2+}$-activated neutral protease (88).

There have been many reports of expression of PKC isoforms in $\beta$-cells, but these have often been contradictory, which makes it difficult to interpret much of the published data. Early studies suggested that pancreatic $\beta$-cells contained the $\alpha$-isoform (105) and the $\beta$II-isoform (106), but neither the $\beta$I-isoform nor the $\gamma$-isoform, whereas rat insulinoma (RINr) cells contained the $\alpha$-isoform, but not the $\beta$-isoforms. It was subsequently reported that rat islets contained both the $\alpha$-isoform and a $\beta$-isoform of PKC (94, 95, 107–109) although there was some disagreement about which endocrine cells within the islets expressed particular PKC isoforms. Thus, the $\alpha$-isoform was localized in either the $\beta$-cells (95, 105, 107, 109) or in peripheral islet cells (108), while a $\beta$-isoform was found in $\beta$-cells (106), in peripheral islet cells but not in $\beta$-cells (95, 108), or was not detectable in any islet cells (109). There is general agreement that the $\gamma$-isoform of PKC is not found in $\beta$-cells, although there is a report that the $\gamma$-isoform is detectable in glucagon-containing $\alpha$-cells (109). It has been reported that the $\epsilon$-isoform of PKC is found only in somatostatin-containing $\delta$-cells (109), but other studies have indicated that it was present in a radiation-induced transplantable insulinoma (110), in MIN6 $\beta$-cells (111), and in islets from ob/ob mice which contain more than 90% $\beta$-cells (112). Observations that the $\delta$-isoform was present in pancreatic islets, but not localized to a particular endocrine cell type (108), have been extended by the report that PKC $\delta$ was the predominant isoform in both insulinoma-derived $\beta$-cells and whole islets and was associated with the cytoskeleton (110). Two recent reports have indicated that MIN6, RINm5F, and $\beta$TC3 $\beta$-cell lines express the $\mu$-isoform (111, 113), but it is not yet clear whether this particular PKC species is expressed in $\beta$-cells of normal islets. The $\zeta$-isoform of PKC has been detected in islets and $\beta$-cell lines (108, 110, 111, 113, 114), as has a novel PKC isoform, $\iota$ (111, 113, 114), which shows ~70% sequence homology with the $\zeta$-isoform.

Identification of particular isoforms of PKC in $\beta$-cells has relied to a large extent on immunological criteria, and some of the discrepancies in the reported expression of PKC isoforms in islet cells may reflect dubious specificities of the antisera used. For example, an early study of PKC isoforms

in rat islet homogenates identified an α-isoform of PKC but found that the β-isoform immunoreactivity migrated on polyacrylamide gels with an apparent molecular mass of 50 kDa, rather than the expected 80 kDa (94). However, a subsequent report from the same group, but using different antisera, detected both α- and β-isoform immunoreactivities migrating with apparent molecular masses of 80 kDa (95). A further cause of conflicting results may stem from changes in the expression of PKC isoforms during development, since it has been reported that the expression of PKC isoforms differs in islets from fetal, neonatal, and adult rats (109). Some of the uncertainty has been resolved by a recent comprehensive study of the isoforms expressed in MIN6 β-cells: a combination of RT-PCR, Northern blotting, and immunoblotting methodologies indicated the presence of PKC-α, -βII, -δ, -ε, -ζ, -λ(Ⅰ), and -μ isoforms (111), although whether or not MIN6 insulinoma cells offer an accurate reflection of PKC isoform expression in authentic β-cells remains to be seen. Furthermore, it is a distinct possibility that there are interspecies variations in isoform expression, and it is not clear whether murine β-cells are a good model for nonrodent species.

### D. Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs)

The MAPK family of proteins are a distinct group of kinases that are activated by dual phosphorylation on threonine and tyrosine residues. They comprise parallel signaling cascades, which appear to be ubiquitous in mammalian cells, and include p42/44 MAP kinases, p38 reactivating kinase (RK), and stress-activated protein kinases (SAP kinases). There have been many recent reviews on the structure and regulation of the MAPK family of kinases (*e.g.*, Refs. 115 and 116).

The expression and function in β-cells of MAPKs have received relatively little attention to date, and the isoforms that are expressed in islets and β-cell lines are summarized in Table 1. Our studies have shown that two forms of MAPK (42 and 44 kDa) are expressed in rodent islets and in MIN6 β-cells (117), and the 44-kDa isoform of MAPK has also been identified in INS-1 cells, another β-cell line (118). Rather than being activated directly by second messengers, MAPK activities are regulated by another kinase(s) (MAPK kinase, also known as MEK; 45–46 kDa) which phosphorylates MAPKs on tyrosine and threonine residues (reviewed in Ref. 119). MEK may be phosphorylated and activated by the upstream serine/threonine kinases, MEK kinase (MEKK), and Raf-1, and we have recently identified both of these proteins in β-cells by immunoblotting (120). There is currently little information about the expression or activities of RK or SAP kinases in insulin-secreting cells.

The identities and functions of β-cell MAPK substrates have not been established, although there is some evidence that induction of early response genes (*junB*, *nur77*, and *zif268*) in INS-1 cells is associated with MAPK activation (118). In other tissues, cytosolic PLA₂ (cPLA₂) is phosphorylated and activated by p42 MAP kinase (121, 122), but glucose-induced cPLA₂ phosphorylation in neonatal islets is reported to be independent from the activation of MAPK (123).

### E. Protein tyrosine kinases

It is now well established that kinases that phosphorylate their substrates on tyrosine residues (protein tyrosine kinases; PTKs) are important in cellular regulation, and several families of PTK have been identified in eukaryotic cells (see Refs. 33 and 37). However, compared with serine/threonine kinases, relatively little information is yet available about the identities and possible functions of PTKs and PTK substrates in the endocrine cells of the pancreas (see Tables 1 and 2). PTK activity has been demonstrated in islets and in β-cell lines using antiphosphotyrosine antibodies to probe Western blots of islet proteins (117, 124–126), or to immunoprecipitate tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins from extracts (127, 128), and it is clear that β-cell proteins over a wide range of molecular masses are substrates for PTKs. These proteins are also substrates for very active phosphotyrosine phosphatase activities: under resting conditions the phosphotyrosine content of β-cell proteins is relatively low, but this is rapidly and markedly enhanced by inhibition of phosphotyrosine phosphatase activity, indicative of rapid phosphorylation/dephosphorylation cycling of the substrates within the cell. The tonic activity of tyrosine kinases under resting conditions and the tight control of tyrosine phosphorylation exerted by phosphotyrosine phosphatases might imply important physiological functions within the β-cell, although these have yet to be determined (*Section IV.E*).

Several receptor and cytoplasmic PTKs in RINm5F cells, fetal rat islets, and adult mouse islets have been identified by PCR amplification of cDNAs using PTK-specific primers (129). A novel PTK identified in RINm5F cells by PCR (120) has now been used to screen a β-cell cDNA library, and the amino acid sequence of a positive clone indicated that it is a member of the src family of cytoplasmic PTKs (130). The nonreceptor tyrosine kinase, JAK2, has been identified in neonatal and adult rat islets where it is expressed at low abundance, mainly in the nucleus (131). TrkA, a receptor PTK that acts as a high-affinity receptor for nerve growth factor, has been localized to both α- and β-cells of adult islets (132). It has been implicated in islet development after the observation that K252a, an inhibitor of Trk receptor PTK activity, inhibited islet morphogenesis (132). Another neurotrophin receptor PTK, TrkC, has been identified in INS-1 β-cells, and it shows increased phosphorylation and activation in response to the receptor ligand neurotrophin-3 (126).

Some PTK substrates (*e.g.*, MAPK, PLCγ, phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase, TrkC) have been identified in islets and β-cell lines based on their increased tyrosine phosphorylation in response to inhibition of phosphotyrosine phosphatases or activation of receptor PTKs (117, 125, 126, 129). In addition, a protein showing glucose- and insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation in islets and in the clonal β-cell line βTC3 has been identified immunologically as the β-subunit of the insulin receptor (124, 127).

### III. Phosphorylation of Endogenous Proteins in β-Cells

Identification of kinase substrates and of their cellular functions is crucial to a full understanding of the regulatory

roles of protein kinases, but this is perhaps the area of most uncertainty at present. Numerous kinase substrates have been reported in β-cells, but little functional information is available and, until recently, the vast majority of these proteins were identified only by their apparent molecular mass or isoelectric point determined by their migration positions on one-dimensional or two-dimensional PAGE. This paucity of information has several causes, some specific to β-cells and some with more general implications. Thus, it is difficult to obtain sufficient quantities of purified islets of Langerhans from experimental animals to permit the isolation, identification, purification, and study of particular kinase substrates of interest. Insulin-secreting cell lines are available in larger amounts, but they are not ideal models for studying β-cell kinase function because cell lines may express different proteins and may have different secretory responses to those of authentic β-cells. More generally, protein phosphorylation is a common regulatory mechanism in eukaryotic cells, and a lack of knowledge about the precise mechanisms of secretory granule trafficking and exocytosis in β-cells makes it difficult to determine which of the many reported phosphorylation events may be involved in the regulation of secretion and which are involved in other cellular processes.

### A. Methods for studying protein phosphorylation in β-cells

Most reported measurements of protein phosphorylation in β-cells have used radioisotopic tracer techniques to follow the transfer of ³²P or, occasionally, of ³⁵S from radiolabeled ATP into protein substrates. More recently, immunological methods have been introduced, using antisera specific for phosphorylated amino acid residues (phosphotyrosine, phosphoserine/threonine) or for phosphorylated consensus-site sequences in substrates, and these methods have proved particularly useful when attempting to identify substrate proteins (see Table 2).

Radioisotopic studies have used variations of three main technical approaches, each with inherent advantages and disadvantages. The simplest method is to add radiolabeled ATP to a broken cell preparation and to measure the consequent ³²P incorporation into endogenous proteins (e.g., Refs. 51, 52, and 104). This experimental approach allows the reaction conditions to be precisely controlled, and it permits the detection of rapid (<1 min) phosphorylation events against very low backgrounds of radiolabeled endogenous substrates. However, in studies using broken-cell preparations it is difficult to relate phosphorylation to insulin secretion, and kinases may phosphorylate proteins to which they would normally have no access because of differing intracellular compartmentalization. This may explain why many more kinase substrates have been reported using this experimental approach than by measuring phosphorylation *in situ*.

These problems can be circumvented by measuring protein phosphorylation in intact cells, which allows direct comparison of kinase activation and protein phosphorylation with second messenger generation and insulin secretion. However, intact β-cells present several technical problems: 1) the presence of an intact plasma membrane limits the extent to which the intracellular pathways can be experimentally modified; 2) an intact plasma membrane also prevents the supply of ³²P as exogenous [γ³²P]ATP, so the endogenous pool of ATP must be radiolabeled by prolonged incubation of the intact tissue in the presence of [³²P]orthophosphate. The resultant high level of background phosphorylation can easily obscure subsequent small stimulus-induced changes; 3) if intracellular ATP has not achieved isotopic equilibrium, any stimulus-induced changes in ATP turnover or in [³²P]orthophosphate uptake may alter the specific radioactivity of the intracellular pool of [γ³²P]ATP.

Islets or cells in which the plasma membranes have been selectively permeabilized by detergents (133) or by high voltage discharge (134) offer some of the technical advantages of both homogenates and intact cells. The permeabilized plasma membranes permit precise control of the intracellular environment in cells in which the cellular architecture and compartmentalization are largely unaffected; the radiolabel can be supplied as [γ³²P]ATP, which allows sensitive detection of rapid phosphorylation events against very low backgrounds of radiolabeled proteins; and effects on protein phosphorylation can be correlated with effects on insulin secretion (134–137). However, permeabilized cells are not useful for studying agents that work entirely or primarily by depolarization of the cell, including the physiologically important nutrient secretagogues.

### B. Endogenous kinase substrates in β-cells

The presence of kinase activators or insulin secretagogues causes enhanced phosphorylation of certain proteins in islets or insulin-secreting cell lines, and these are listed by reported molecular mass in Table 2. The listings in Table 2 show that a large number of substrates for regulated kinases have been reported in β-cells and there may, on first sight, appear to be little agreement between different studies. However, most of the reported molecular masses are derived from migration positions on PAGE, and small differences in gel composition, running conditions, etc., could produce small variations in the calculated molecular masses of phosphorylated proteins, greatly increasing the number of reported substrates and creating the appearance of disagreement where none actually exists. In contrast, on some occasions different experimental approaches detect the same kinase substrates, and these are apparent from the listings in Table 2 as substrates that have been reported by many different groups using different β-cell preparations and technical approaches.

The components of the insulin-secretory process can be arbitrarily classified into four main areas: 1) nutrient transport and metabolism; 2) plasma membrane events; 3) generation of intracellular regulators; 4) secretory granule transport and exocytosis. β-Cell phosphoproteins have been implicated at each of these different stages.

#### 1. Nutrient transport and metabolism

Glucose transport across the β-cell plasma membrane is not considered to be rate limiting for insulin secretion (138), although it has been demonstrated that PKA activation by forskolin results in rapid serine/threonine phosphorylation of the β-cell glucose transporter, GLUT2 (139). Once inside the β-cell, nutrient secretagogues must be metabolized to stimulate insulin secretion
(140), and the phosphorylation state of metabolic enzymes often regulates their activity. A 57-kDa substrate for CaMK was reported to react with antipyruvate kinase antibodies (141), but this identification has not been confirmed, and there is little evidence in $\beta$-cells that protein kinases control secretion by regulating metabolic functions.

2. *Plasma membrane events.* Pancreatic $\beta$-cells are excitable cells that depend upon depolarization of the plasma membrane as a means of responding to some external stimuli. There is some evidence that the phosphorylation state of ion channels in $\beta$-cell plasma membranes may influence their function (142). For example, it was suggested on the basis of electrophysiological evidence that in RINm5F $\beta$-cells the $K_{ATP}$ channels are targets for PKC (143) or unspecified protein kinases (144), but the relevance of this to physiological secretory responses is unclear since PKC activation induced insulin release from normal mouse $\beta$-cells without modifying the membrane potential (145). Independent cloning studies have now indicated that there are at least three subfamilies of the inward rectifier $K^{+}$ channel family expressed in $\beta$-cells, designated u$K_{ATP}$-1, $K_{ATP}$-2, and Kir6.2 (146–148), and that the sulfonylurea receptors are members of the ATP-binding cassette superfamily (149). The sulfonylurea receptor does not have intrinsic channel activity but confers sulfonylurea sensitivity on a variety of inward rectifier $K^{+}$ channels (150, 151). Both the $K_{ATP}$ channels and the sulfonylurea receptors have several potential phosphorylation sites for PKC and PKA (146, 147, 149), suggesting that their activities may be modulated by these kinases. Future studies using channels and sulfonylurea receptors mutated at potential phosphorylation sites will provide insights into the physiological relevance of channel phosphorylation in the regulation of $\beta$-cell electrical excitability.

Depolarization of the $\beta$-cell causes the opening of voltage-dependent $Ca^{2+}$ channels (VDCC) and the $\alpha_1$- and $\beta_3$-subunits of the $\beta$-cell L-type $Ca^{2+}$ channel have been cloned; the $\alpha_1$-subunit acts as a voltage sensor and forms the ion-conducting pore, and the $\beta_3$-subunit modulates channel activity (152). A $\beta$-subunit cloned from brain, and also detected in RINm5F and $\beta$TC3 cells, encodes numerous consensus phosphorylation sites (153) whereas the $\beta$-cell $\alpha_1$-subunit cloned from human $\beta$-cells contains 11 potential phosphorylation sites for PKA, 9 for PKG, and 1 for PKC (154, 155). There is much early experimental evidence, mainly from studies of insulin secretion and $Ca^{2+}$ influx/efflux, that cAMP can modulate $Ca^{2+}$ handling by $\beta$-cells (156), although the significance of this to the secretory response is still not clear. More recently, the activation of PKA has been shown directly to increase the phosphorylation of the $\alpha_1$ VDCC subunit in $\beta$TC3 cells, suggesting a role for PKA in the regulation of $Ca^{2+}$ influx in these insulinoma cells (157). It has also been suggested that PKC may regulate $Ca^{2+}$ influx into $\beta$-cells by changing the phosphorylation state of the L-type VDCC (158), although there has, as yet, been no direct demonstration of PKC-mediated phosphorylation of $\beta$-cell VDCC subunit(s). As for the $K_{ATP}$ channel, it is clear that future measurements of the functional consequences of modifying VDCC subunits will delineate the importance of these phosphorylation events in the initiation and maintenance of $\beta$-cell secretory responses.

Although it seems likely that $\beta$-cell ion channels are targets for phosphorylation by regulated kinases, such effects alone cannot account for the stimulatory effects of second messengers on insulin secretion since cAMP and activators of PKC can stimulate insulin secretion from permeabilized islets or from single voltage-clamped $\beta$-cells independently of ion fluxes (29, 159–164).

3. *Generation of intracellular regulators.* The $\beta$-cell signal transduction systems that generate intracellular regulators may themselves be modified by phosphorylation. Receptor-mediated, nonnutrient secretagogues often influence intracellular events through G proteins, which are known to be substrates for kinases in other tissues (165–167), and there is some indirect evidence that insulin secretagogues stimulate the phosphorylation of $\beta$-cell G proteins. For example, the phosphorylation of $G_i$ by PKC may modulate $\beta$-cell AC activity (168–170), and a PKC substrate of the appropriate molecular mass ($\sim$40 kDa) for the $\alpha$-subunit of $G_i$ has been reported in several studies (Table 2). The enzymes regulated by G proteins may also be targets for protein kinases. In RINm5F cells the $\gamma$-isoform of PLC is tyrosine phosphorylated (129), while in neonatal rat islets cPLA$_2$ is phosphorylated by PKC (123).

In addition to phosphorylating other protein substrates, it is known that CaMK, PKC, and PKA are themselves kinase substrates, and p42/44 MAP kinases require threonine and tyrosine phosphorylation for activation (*Section II.D*). The subunits of CaMK II autophosphorylate in the presence of $Ca^{2+}$ and CaM and thus become much less $Ca^{2+}$ dependent (41). It seems probable that the $\beta$-cell proteins of molecular masses 53–55 kDa, which have been reported by many groups to be substrates for $Ca^{2+}$-dependent phosphorylation (Table 2), are autophosphorylated CaMK II subunits (49, 58). The RII-regulatory subunit of type II PKA can be phosphorylated by the catalytic subunit (44), and it has been suggested that a 54-kDa islet protein, which is a substrate for PKA and which binds azido-cAMP, may be an autophosphorylated regulatory subunit of PKA (74). Similarly, it has been suggested that the 80-kDa islet protein substrate for PKC is autophosphorylated PKC (171), although it is more likely to be the myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate (MARCKS) protein, which is a filamentous actin cross-linking protein of approximately 80-kDa molecular mass whose function is modified by PKC-mediated phosphorylation (172). Enhanced phosphorylation of MARCKS in response to PKC-activating phorbol esters, to cholinergic agonists, and to glucose has been reported in rat and mouse islets (103, 107, 173).

The regulation of effector systems by phosphorylation may not be responsible for the initiation of insulin-secretory responses but may play an important role in coordinating responses to different stimuli and in determining the rate and extent of the response. There is some evidence for cross-talk between signaling systems in $\beta$-cells, and this has been reviewed elsewhere (174). At present, little of the experimental evidence for cross-talk in $\beta$-cells is at the level of kinase activation or protein phosphorylation, and so this interesting
area is beyond the scope of the present review. Whatever the importance of phosphorylation in modifying the generation of intracellular regulators, the effects of those regulators on secretion from permeabilized and patch clamped cells (159–164) implies that there exist downstream from the generation of the regulators kinase substrates whose phosphorylation state regulates the secretory response.

4. **Secretory granule transport and exocytosis.** Cytoskeletal elements such as actin, myosin, and tubulin are involved in the movement of insulin-secretory granules within the β-cell (175), and thus offer potential sites at which kinases may regulate secretory responses. There is some evidence implicating cytoskeletal proteins in regulated phosphorylation events reported in β-cells. For example, the 20-kDa protein substrate detected in several studies (Table 2) is almost certainly myosin light chain, which acts primarily as a substrate for islet MLCK (48, 50). The 57-kDa and 54-kDa islet substrates for Ca²⁺-dependent phosphorylation were identified as the α- and β-subunits of tubulin on the basis of their electrophoretic mobilities and immunoreactivity with anti-tubulin antibody (54), but this identification was disputed on the basis of the isoelectric point of the 57-kDa protein (74). The 80-kDa MARCKS protein is an actin-cross-linking protein that shows stimulus-dependent increases in phosphorylation in rat and mouse islets (103, 107, 173).

The exocytotic release of secretory granule contents requires the docking of secretory granules at the site of exocytosis, a priming process that renders the granule competent for exocytosis, followed by fusion of granule membranes with the plasma membrane. As detailed in Table 2, a number of unidentified kinase substrates have been localized to β-cell secretory granules or membrane fractions, and some of these may be involved in the exocytotic docking and/or fusion processes. Advances in our understanding of the general mechanisms of exocytosis have been reviewed recently (*e.g.*, Refs. 176 and 177), and a full discussion of this topic in β-cells has been the subject of a comprehensive review (15). In brief, vesicles are directed to the site of exocytosis by interactions between receptors located on the secretory vesicle membrane (v-SNAREs) or on the target membrane (t-SNAREs), a process that is regulated by the low molecular mass G proteins of the Rab family. Membrane fusion events are thought to be triggered by interaction of N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein (NSF) and the soluble NSF attachment proteins (SNAPs) with the SNARE complex in an ATP-hydrolyzing reaction. Recent studies have shown that β-cells express NSF and its attachment protein αSNAP (178), Rab3 proteins (179), the vesicle-associated SNARE proteins, VAMP and cellubrevin (180, 181), and the plasma-membrane associated target SNARE proteins, synaptosome-associated protein-25 (SNAP-25) and syntaxin 1–4 (181–184). A recent *in vitro* study using recombinant proteins demonstrated that VAMP and αSNAP are phosphorylated by CaMK II and PKA, respectively (185), although there is as yet no evidence that any of these proteins are phosphorylated in β-cells. A recent report suggests that SNAP-25 is tyrosine phosphorylated in RIN 1046–38 β-cells in response to a combination of glucose and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), although the kinase responsible has not been identified (186). Other proteins that

have been implicated in exocytosis have been identified as phosphoproteins in β-cells. For example, annexin-I, a protein implicated in membrane fusion events (187), is present in insulin-secretory granules and is phosphorylated in a glucose-dependent manner (188); and an 84-kDa secretory granule-associated synapsin protein is phosphorylated by CaMK II in glucose-stimulated MIN6 β-cells (58).

### IV. Protein Kinases and the Regulation of Insulin Secretion

It should be stated clearly at the beginning of this section that much of the evidence implicating particular protein kinases in physiologically relevant insulin-secretory responses is inconclusive, confusing, and often contradictory. In our view, much of the confusion is caused by studies of kinase function that are based on measuring secretory responses to a single protein kinase inhibitor of uncertain specificity. A full discussion of protein kinase inhibitors is beyond the scope of this review but, given the importance of this experimental approach in shaping the consensus view of β-cell function, it is worth considering briefly the different types of protein kinase inhibition that have been used in pancreatic β-cells.

The most commonly used protein serine/threonine kinase inhibitors are those that inhibit phosphorylation by interacting with the ATP-binding site of the enzyme, but inhibitors of this type tend to be poorly selective since the ATP-binding sites of the common regulated serine/threonine protein kinases are very similar (reviewed in Refs. 35, 37, and 189). More recently developed ATP-binding site inhibitors appear to show a higher degree of selectivity (190, 191), although it is uncertain whether this approach will permit specific inhibition of individual kinase isoforms. Inhibitors that act by interfering with the binding of the intracellular activators (*e.g.*, Ca²⁺/CaM, cAMP, DAG) offer potentially more selectivity between classes of regulated kinases (192–194), although these inhibitors may not differentiate between kinase isoforms, and they may also inhibit binding of the activators to response elements other than protein kinases. A greater degree of selectivity can be obtained using consensus site-derived pseudosubstrate peptide sequences that bind to and inhibit the substrate site of the kinases (195), but the unmodified peptide sequences are poorly membrane permeant, which has largely limited their use to single-cell microinjection or patch-clamp preparations (164, 196) and to populations of permeabilized cells (197, 198). Chemical modification of the peptides can make them more membrane permeant (199), and this approach has been applied to peptide inhibitors of PKC (200) and PKA (201) in β-cells.

The problems of inhibitor specificity and delivery can be circumvented by generating β-cells deficient in the enzyme of interest. One useful pharmacological approach, that of down-regulation of the DAG-sensitive conventional and novel isoforms of PKC by prolonged treatment with phorbol esters, has been widely applied to study the roles of PKC in β-cells, as described in Section IV.C. Transfection of β-cells with antisense nucleotide sequences to prevent the expression of particular protein kinases is feasible (202, 203) but, as
with the inhibitory peptides, the major technical problem lies with introducing sufficient amounts of the antisense sequence into populations of cells in a reproducible manner. Stable antisense transfects to prevent kinase expression have not yet been reported for β-cells, but this may offer an effective means of selectively depleting cells of kinase isoforms. Conversely, stable transfection of RINm5F cells with a viral vector coding for the δ-isoform of CaMK II has been reported (204), and this overexpression approach may provide useful information complementary to inhibitor studies. Transgenic animal models are now becoming more widely available, and several protein kinase knockout animals have been reported (205–207), although information is not yet available about β-cell function in these models. This technical approach has also been used in conjunction with a β-cell-specific promoter to overexpress CaM selectively in β-cells, which results in severely diabetic neonates with reduced β-cell number and abnormal β-cell morphology (208). These defects were later attributed to Ca²⁺ buffering by the overexpressed CaM, rather than to the activation of Ca²⁺/CaM-dependent effectors within the β-cells (209). A similar approach has been used to modify the cAMP/PKA signaling pathway in β-cells either by overexpressing cholera toxin, which irreversibly activates Gₛ (210), or by overexpressing a constitutively active α-subunit of Gₛ (211).

Given the uncertainties inherent in many of the individual approaches used to study kinase function in β-cells, the sequential application of disparate methods seems more likely to produce an accurate evaluation of the importance of a particular kinase/isoform in the generation and/or maintenance of secretory responses to a specific stimulus. Accordingly, we suggest that, wherever possible, the following criteria should be satisfied to indicate the involvement of a particular protein kinase/isoform in physiological insulin-secretory responses.

1. Nutrient and/or nonnutrient secretagogues should generate activators of the kinase(s) at the appropriate concentrations, time, and intracellular locations.
2. Physiologically relevant concentrations of the secretagogue(s) should induce kinase activation and phosphorylation of endogenous protein substrates.
3. Experimentally induced elevations in intracellular concentrations of the kinase activators should stimulate protein phosphorylation and thus modify insulin secretion.
4. Blocking protein phosphorylation using structurally and, where possible, mechanistically dissimilar kinase inhibitors should inhibit phosphorylation and secretory responses to physiological secretagogues.
5. β-Cells deficient in the protein kinase/isoform should exhibit appropriately diminished secretory responses to physiological agents.

Using this approach it is possible to define, to some extent, the involvement of protein kinases in the regulation of insulin secretion even where the identities and functions of the kinase substrates are as yet unknown.

### A. Ca²⁺/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases

Changes in intracellular Ca²⁺ concentrations play a vital role in the regulation of insulin secretion by both nutrient and nonnutrient secretagogues, and the complexities of stimulus-induced changes in β-cell Ca²⁺ have been covered in many excellent reviews (*e.g.*, Refs. 6–9, 16, and 212). Stated simply, nutrient secretagogues elevate cytosolic Ca²⁺ primarily through an influx of extracellular Ca²⁺, while some receptor-operated nonnutrient secretagogues generate IP₃, which increases cytosolic Ca²⁺ by mobilizing intracellular stores of Ca²⁺. Sulfonylureas, cationic amino acids (*e.g.*, arginine) and K⁺ induce Ca²⁺ entry through VDCC by depolarizing the β-cell plasma membrane, whereas Ca²⁺ ionophores such as A23187 facilitate the transport of Ca²⁺ across membranes. Experiments using permeabilized islets have demonstrated that increasing the intracellular concentration of Ca²⁺ (from ~50 nM to 1–10 μM) is alone a sufficient stimulus to induce an ATP-dependent stimulation of insulin secretion (133, 160). More recently, measurements of exocytosis from single β-cells by monitoring changes in membrane capacitance have confirmed that elevated Ca²⁺ is a sufficient trigger for exocytosis (164).

In common with other secretory cells, pancreatic β-cells express a variety of Ca²⁺-sensitive proteins that may be involved in sensing and responding to changes in cytosolic Ca²⁺, and CaMK II is one likely candidate for transducing Ca²⁺-mobilizing signals into a secretory response. Thus, the Ca²⁺/CaM-dependent phosphorylation of 54- to 57-kDa proteins in rat islet microsomal fractions (54) was also detected in permeabilized islets *in situ* and was accompanied by Ca²⁺-induced insulin secretion (133, 134). A correlation between phosphorylation and insulin secretion was also observed in ³²P-labeled intact islets in which glucose stimulated both insulin release and phosphorylation of the 54-kDa protein (54). In more recent experiments, measurements of CaMK II autophosphorylation, and subsequent Ca²⁺-independence, have been used as a reflection of CaMK activation in intact islets. Glucose or depolarizing concentrations of K⁺ caused rapid, concentration-dependent increases in CaMK activity as a result of Ca²⁺ entry through VDCC (213, 214), and a similar activation was caused through the mobilization of intracellular Ca²⁺ by the muscarinic agonist CCh (214). The glucose concentration dependence of CaMK II activation was closely correlated to the stimulation of insulin secretion, suggesting that the two events may be linked, and CaMK II activation preceded the initiation of insulin secretion, as would be required if CaMK II was playing a causal role in the secretory response (213). The increase in autophosphorylated autonomous CaMK II activity in response to CCh was rapid (214), in accordance with the reported rapid effects of muscarinic agonists on β-cell Ca²⁺ (158, 215–217), but it was transient and returned to basal levels within 1–2 min (214). In static incubations, CaMK II activation by glucose was also relatively transient, returning to unstimulated levels within 20 min (213), although elevations in β-cell cytosolic Ca²⁺ and insulin secretion are maintained for the duration of a glucose stimulus (103, 218, 219). The observations in intact islets in static incubations parallel observations in perfused permeabilized islets and β-cells that insulin-secretory responses to elevations in Ca²⁺ are transient (136, 220, 221), with the loss of secretory responsiveness to Ca²⁺ being accompanied by a reduction in CaMK activity (136), and suggest that the activation of CaMK II cannot alone account for the maintained
secretory responses to nutrient secretagogues. In contrast to the data obtained in static incubations of intact islets and perfused permeabilized islets, there has been a recent report that CaMK II activation is closely correlated with glucose-stimulated insulin secretion for up to 30 min when measured in perfusion experiments (222), suggesting a relationship between CaMK II activity and maintained insulin secretion. More studies examining the time course of CaMK II activation are required to resolve whether CaMK is involved not only in the initiation of nutrient-stimulated insulin secretion, but also in its maintenance.

Studies using inhibitors of CaMK II generally support a role in the regulation of insulin secretion in response to $Ca^{2+}$-mobilizing stimuli. Early investigations of the involvement of CaMKs in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion made use of the CaM antagonist, TFP, which inhibited glucose-stimulated insulin secretion without affecting glucose oxidation (223). In a Syrian hamster insulinoma both $Ca^{2+}$/CaM-stimulated phosphorylation of 60-kDa and 98-kDa proteins and $K^+$-stimulated insulin secretion were inhibited by TFP (47, 224). Similarly, TFP abolished phosphorylation of a 55-kDa CaMK substrate in rat islets and inhibited insulin secretion stimulated by glucose, leucine, and glibenclamide (225). However, TFP is not a direct inhibitor of CaMK, but is a CaM antagonist and has been shown to exert inhibitory effects on other CaM-dependent enzymes, and on other protein kinases including PKC (226). An alternative CaMK inhibitor, dehydrouramil, inhibited CaMK activity in islet extracts with little effect on PKA or PKC activities, and dehydrouramil inhibited glucose-induced insulin secretion from intact rat islets (227). More recently, at least four separate studies have demonstrated that the novel CaMK II inhibitor, KN-62, inhibits nutrient-induced insulin secretion (61, 228–230). KN-62 is a competitive inhibitor at the CaM-binding site and had no effect on RINm5F cell PKC activity or on MLCK activity (229). However, in HIT cells the inhibitory effects of KN-62 on nutrient- and $K^+$-stimulated insulin secretion were coupled to an inhibition of $Ca^{2+}$ entry, and it did not inhibit insulin release stimulated by $Ca^{2+}$ in permeabilized HIT cells (228). The inhibitory effect of KN-62 on $Ca^{2+}$ current has also been observed in single mouse $\beta$-cells, but in this model KN-62 also caused a decrease in depolarization-induced membrane capacitance, indicative of an inhibition of exocytosis (164). Peptides directed against regulatory domains of CaMK II offer an alternative means of inhibiting enzyme activity, and synthetic sequences corresponding to amino acids 281–309 and 290–309 of the rat brain 50-kDa CaMK II subunit are potent inhibitors of islet CaMK II activity *in vitro* (our unpublished data). Administration of peptide 290–309 to mouse $\beta$-cells via a patch pipette resulted in a 60% reduction in depolarization-induced increase in membrane capacitance, without any effect on the $Ca^{2+}$ current (164), suggesting that the activation of CaMK II is required for full exocytic responses after the depolarization-induced elevations in $Ca^{2+}$.

Most investigations of CaMKs in $\beta$-cells have focused on the multifunctional CaMK II rather than on CaMK III or MLCK. There is no evidence that CAMK III is involved in the regulation of insulin secretion, although the identification of elongation factor 2 as the major CaMK III substrate in islets

suggests a role in the regulation of $\beta$-cell protein synthesis (55). In contrast, there is some circumstantial evidence that MLCK may be involved in the secretory process, although the strength of the evidence depends entirely on the selectivity of the inhibitors employed. Thus, an MLCK inhibitor, ML-9, inhibited phosphorylation of myosin light chains by islet extracts and also caused a small (~30%) inhibition of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (230); glucose-induced insulin secretion from MIN6 $\beta$-cells was totally inhibited by the fungal metabolite, wortmannin, which is an inhibitor of MLCK at the high concentrations used in this study (231); and there is one report that antibodies against MLCK inhibit insulin release from permeabilized islets (232).

On balance, the available experimental evidence suggests that CaMK II is involved in mediating $\beta$-cell-secretory responses to $Ca^{2+}$-mobilizing stimuli, and data from a number of groups fulfill criteria 1–4: the effects of insulin secretagogues on increased intracellular $Ca^{2+}$ in $\beta$-cells correlate with increased CaMK II activity and the phosphorylation of endogenous CaMK II substrates; experimental elevations in $\beta$-cell cytosolic $Ca^{2+}$ stimulate phosphorylation and insulin secretion; and a number of CaMK inhibitors inhibit insulin secretion. CaMK II may therefore be responsible for the initiation of an insulin-secretory response to nutrient secretagogues, and for enhancing nutrient-induced responses by IP$_3$-generating agonists, as depicted in Fig. 1. However, the time courses of CaMK II activity and of $Ca^{2+}$-induced insulin secretion suggest that the activation of CaMK II is alone unlikely to produce a physiological pattern of prolonged

FIG. 1. The role of CaMK in $\beta$-cell responses to nutrient and non-nutrient stimuli. The schematic diagram shows how CaMK II may be involved in transducing signals from nutrients (e.g., glucose) and nonnutrients (e.g., acetylcholine, ACh). **Nutrients**: glucose enters the $\beta$-cell on the GLUT2 transporter and is metabolized with a consequent generation of ATP and closure of $K_{ATP}$ channels. The decreased efflux of $K^+$ leads to depolarization of the $\beta$-cell with the consequent opening of VDCCs and an influx of extracellular $Ca^{2+}$ down its concentration gradient. The $Ca^{2+}$ binds to CaM, and the $Ca^{2+}$/CaM complex binds to the inactive kinase (CaMK$_i$), which becomes enzymically active (CaMK$_a$). The active CaMK phosphorylates (PO$_4$) $\beta$-cell substrate proteins, and these phosphorylation events stimulate the secretory process. **Nonnutrients**: agonists bind to cell-surface receptors that are coupled via the heterotrimeric GTP-binding protein $G_q$ to PLC. Receptor occupancy activates PLC with the consequent generation of IP$_3$ by the hydrolysis of membrane inositol phospholipids. IP$_3$ releases stored $Ca^{2+}$ from the endoplasmic reticulum, and the elevation in intracellular $Ca^{2+}$ activates CaMK, as described above.

insulin secretion. If this is the case, the maintained elevations in cytosolic Ca²⁺ in response to nutrients may subserve another function, perhaps by activating a Ca²⁺-response element other than CaMK II that is required for the maintenance of a prolonged secretory response.

**B. Cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinases**

It is well documented that physiological regulators of insulin secretion can induce changes in the concentration of cAMP within β-cells. Glucose and other nutrient secretagogues cause small but significant increases in islet cAMP by a Ca²⁺-dependent mechanism (reviewed in Ref. 12), and this is accompanied by a glucose-dependent increase in the phosphorylation of endogenous PKA substrates (49, 233, 234). A number of receptor-mediated insulin secretagogues stimulate insulin secretion primarily through increasing the cytosolic concentrations of cAMP. For example, glucagon, GLP-1, GIP, and PACAP activate β-cell AC via Gₛ (13, 235). There is surprisingly little information about the effects of these agonists on protein phosphorylation in islets or β-cells: in a few early studies glucagon was reported to increase PKA-dependent phosphorylations in islets (*e.g.*, Refs. 234 and 236), but there is little direct evidence that the other AC-activating, receptor-operated, nonnutrient insulin secretagogues stimulate PKA-dependent phosphorylation events in β-cells.

In contrast, there have been numerous reports over the past two decades that experimentally induced elevations in β-cell cAMP can enhance insulin secretion. The reported effects are remarkably consistent whether β-cell cAMP was elevated by activating AC using forskolin or cholera toxin through inhibition of cAMP degradation by phosphodiesterases (reviewed in Refs. 7, 8, and 12); by introducing cAMP in permeabilized β-cells (159, 161, 237); or by using membrane-permeant analogs of cAMP in intact β-cells (238, 239). Studies using transgenic mice showing β-cell-specific expression of the AC-activating A1 subunit of cholera toxin found surprisingly little change in β-cell morphology, cAMP content, or insulin-secretory responses to glucose (210), suggesting the existence of a counterregulatory mechanism to prevent unregulated elevations in β-cell cAMP. Similarly, overexpression of the α-subunit of the AC-linked Gₛ did not affect cAMP content or secretory responses of islets or perfused pancreas to glucose alone, but the stimulatory effects of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX) were enhanced (211). These studies suggest that β-cells have an unexpected capacity to adapt their physiological function in the event of up-regulation of AC activity, which may complicate interpretation of experiments in which there are maintained, rather than short-term, alterations in the status of key regulatory molecules.

Until recently, studies of the physiological functions of PKA were hampered by the lack of specific, membrane-permeant inhibitors of the enzyme. In an early report, 2-deoxyadenosine, an inhibitor of islet AC activity (240), blocked IBMX-induced phosphorylation of a 15-kDa islet protein, with a concomitant reduction in IBMX-induced insulin secretion (233), but the effects of this inhibitor on secretory responses to physiologically relevant nutrients or nonnutrients were not investigated. More recently, membrane-permeant competitive antagonists of cAMP have been developed and shown to inhibit PKA-mediated events in islets (137), single β-cells (29, 163, 241), and α-cells (242). Rp-cAMPS has been used to block protein phosphorylation (137) and insulin-secretory responses induced by cAMP and forskolin (137, 163, 241) to demonstrate that these events are PKA dependent. More recently, GIP-induced exocytosis in patch-clamped β-cells was suppressed by Rp-8-Br-cAMPS (29), suggesting that GIP and other AC-linked, nonnutrient secretagogues enhance insulin secretion primarily through the activation of PKA (Figure 2).

There is general agreement that agents that elevate β-cell cAMP enhance nutrient-induced insulin secretion but do not initiate secretory responses from intact β-cells at substimulatory glucose concentrations, suggesting that the activation of PKA acts as a potentiator rather than a primary trigger for insulin secretion (reviewed in Ref. 12). Intriguingly, there are at least two experimental exceptions to this generalization: 1) cAMP alone was a sufficient stimulus for insulin secretion in permeabilized β-cells in which intracellular Ca²⁺ had been clamped at a substimulatory concentration (161); and 2) capacitance measurements of exocytosis in single β-cells demonstrated that cAMP stimulated exocytosis independently of increases in Ca²⁺ (163). The significance of these observations is uncertain, but they confirm that the activation of PKA can directly stimulate the release of insulin in the appropriate circumstances.

Although PKA activation is normally not sufficient to initiate insulin secretion, it remains a possibility that PKA activation is required for secretory responses to nutrients. There have been a number of reports that poor or absent β-cell responses to glucose can be remedied by agonist-induced or pharmacological elevations in intracellular cAMP in isolated patch-clamped β-cells (241), in purified populations of β-cells (215, 243, 244), and in freshly isolated islets (211, 245), implying that the β-cell content of cAMP, and thus

FIG. 2. The potentiation of secretion by nonnutrient secretagogues through PKA activation. Under resting conditions, PKA exists as an inactive tetramer comprising two regulatory (R) subunits and two inactive catalytic subunits (PKA<sub>ci</sub>). Agonists such as PACAP, GIP, or glucagon bind to cell surface receptors that are coupled via the heterotrimeric G protein Gₛ to AC. Receptor occupancy activates AC with the consequent generation of cAMP from ATP. The cAMP binds to two sites on the regulatory subunits, causing the inactive tetramer to dissociate, liberating active catalytic subunits (PKA<sub>ca</sub>) that stimulate insulin secretion through the phosphorylation (PO₄) of protein substrates.

the activation state of PKA, is a vital component in nutrient-induced insulin secretion. In contrast to this, glucose-induced insulin secretion from freshly isolated islets was not significantly inhibited by Rp-cAMPS (137) or by a membrane-permeant, myristoylated peptide inhibitor of PKA (201), although both inhibitors were shown to inhibit phosphorylation and secretory responses to cAMP and forskolin. Experimental models in which the expression of β-cell PKA is suppressed are not yet available. Such models could determine decisively whether the activation of PKA is obligatory for nutrient-induced insulin secretion and the extent to which nonnutrients modify β-cell responses by PKA-dependent protein phosphorylation.

Islets of Langerhans also express cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) activity (78), and a role for cyclic GMP in the stimulation of insulin secretion has been proposed (246). Glucose produces small increases in islet cyclic GMP content, although the time course of the onset of this effect varies from 2–3 min (247) to at least 30 min (248), whereas the secretory response to glucose is maximal within approximately 2–3 min, perhaps suggesting that the two events are not causally related. There is also no clear consensus on the effects of experimental elevations in β-cell cyclic GMP, which are reported to be stimulatory (246, 249), inhibitory (250), or without effect (248). Some cytokines, such as interleukin-1β and tumor necrosis factor-α, produce nitric oxide-mediated increases in islet cyclic GMP content (251, 252) and also inhibit glucose-induced insulin secretion, but the effects on insulin secretion can be dissociated from cyclic GMP accumulation (253). The activation of PKG therefore seems unlikely to play a major role in the regulation of β-cell secretory responses to metabolic stimuli or to receptor-operated agonists. However, a recent report has implicated cyclic GMP, and by implication PKG, in the induction of apoptotic cell death in β-cells (254). It remains an intriguing and therapeutically important possibility that manipulation of PKG activity may influence β-cell survival in the face of apoptotic stimuli, and this is surely an area worthy of further study.

### C. Ca²⁺/phospholipid-dependent protein kinases

The role(s) played by members of the PKC family of isoenzymes in the regulation of insulin secretion has been the subject of numerous studies over the past decade or so, many of which have produced conflicting data. This area of β-cell research has been reviewed extensively elsewhere (e.g., Refs. 255–258), and readers are referred to one or more of these reviews for detailed comment, while we will limit ourselves to a broad consideration of the criteria outlined in Section IV.

There is no doubt that physiological regulators of insulin secretion can generate (potential) activators of PKC within β-cells. The major physiological regulators of β-cell PKC activity are likely to be DAGs, which activate isoforms of PKC containing two C1 cysteine-rich repeats (all isoforms except ζ, ι/λ, and μ). A variety of receptor-operated non-nutrient secretagogues, including CCh, CCK, and AVP, activate β-cell PLC via Gq leading to the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate (PIP₂) and the generation of DAG (22, 25, 258). Nutrient secretagogues also increase β-cell DAG content, but by two independent methods: by enhancing de novo synthesis of DAG (259) and by a Ca²⁺-dependent activation of PLC (22). It is important to note that PLC activation appears to contribute little to the glucose-induced increase in DAG mass within islets, which is predominantly enriched in palmitic acid, indicative of synthesis de novo (259), rather than stearoyl-arachidonyl configuration indicative of hydrolysis from PIP₂. It is also worth noting that PLC-generated stearoyl-arachidonyl DAG is a much more potent activator of PKC in vitro than is the species of DAG synthesized de novo (260), which may be an important clue as to the roles of PKC in nutrient and receptor-operated secretory responses. The DAG-sensitive isoforms of PKC can also be activated by long chain unsaturated fatty acids such as AA, which have been shown to activate islet PKC in vitro (85, 86) and which may be important regulators of insulin secretion (261). AA can also be converted to DAG by DAG lipase, providing an alternative source of DAG for PKC activation. Both nutrient and nonnutrient secretagogues activate β-cell PLA₂, thus stimulating AA production by the hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine (26, 262, 263).

There is also no doubt that the activation of DAG-sensitive isoforms of PKC within β-cells stimulates insulin secretion. It is well documented that a variety of DAG analogs, including the tumor-promoting phorbol esters, cause prolonged insulin-secretory responses in isolated islets and β-cell suspensions (reviewed in Ref. 257). The onset of the insulin-secretory response of islets to 4β-phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) closely parallels the time course of the second phase of insulin secretion in response to glucose, and this has been interpreted as being indicative of a role for PKC in mediating this phase of glucose-stimulated insulin release (264). The effects of PKC activators on insulin secretion are accompanied by effects on protein phosphorylation, and several PKC substrates have been identified in both islets and insulin-secreting cell lines stimulated with phorbol esters (see Table 2). In some instances, glucose and/or CCh have similar effects to those seen after the direct activation of PKC, perhaps suggesting common activation of the same kinase (Ref. 257 and references therein). The most convincing evidence of PKC activation by a physiologically relevant insulin secretagogue has been the observation, using two-dimensional SDS-PAGE, that CCh stimulates the phosphorylation of the PKC substrate MARCKS (103, 173). An effect of nutrients on MARCKS phosphorylation is less convincing. In one study, glucose clearly stimulated ³²P incorporation into MARCKS, to the same extent as that caused by PMA (107), but other studies have reported negligible effects of glucose on MARCKS phosphorylation, certainly much less than those caused by CCh or PMA (103, 173).

As discussed in Section II.C, the activation of DAG-sensitive PKC isoforms is accompanied by translocation of the enzyme from the cytosol to a membrane compartment (93), and this physical redistribution of PKC has been widely used to assess PKC activation in response to insulin secretagogues, either by measuring the activity of DAG-sensitive isoforms of the enzyme in cytosolic and membrane fractions, or by immunodetection of the distribution of particular PKC isoforms. Both PMA and CCh stimulate PKC redistribution between subcellular fractions, whether measured by phosphorylation of an exogenous substrate or by quantitative

immunoblotting (88, 89, 94, 260, 265, 266). This experimental approach therefore supports a role for PKC activation in secretory responses to PLC-coupled nonnutrient secretagogues. The effects of nutrients are not so clear. Although there is one report of a glucose-induced increase in membrane-associated PKC activity (90), most studies agree that nutrients such as glucose and glyceraldehyde do not stimulate the translocation of PKC enzyme activity in islets or β-cells (88, 89, 96, 260, 267). In contrast, immunoblotting and immunocytochemical approaches have shown nutrient-induced translocation of the α- (94, 95, 107, 112) and ε- (112) isoforms of PKC. The reasons for these discrepancies between experimental approaches are not clear, but the existence of such conflicting observations raises questions about using PKC translocation as the sole measure of its involvement in secretory responses to nutrients.

A range of inhibitors have been employed in attempts to define the role of PKC in β-cells, but many of these studies have merely added to the confusion about whether or not PKC is required for a secretory response to nutrients. A variety of kinase inhibitors, including H-7, clomiphene, polymyxin B, and staurosporine, inhibited PKC activity and insulin secretion in response to glucose (89, 268–271), to cholinergic agonists (173, 268, 272), and to CCK (273), suggesting that PKC activation is required for a full secretory response to nutrients and PLC-activating nonnutrients. However, it is difficult to draw firm conclusions from these observations since all of these compounds are relatively nonselective kinase inhibitors (274, 275). For example, staurosporine has been widely used as a PKC inhibitor in β-cells, but the original description of staurosporine presented it as an equipotent inhibitor of PKA and PKC (276), and it is a potent inhibitor of islet PKA and CaMK activities (271). More recently developed PKC inhibitors show improved selectivity for PKC and some degree of selectivity for PKC isoforms. The staurosporine derivative Ro 31–8220 inhibited all PKC isoforms tested (277) and partially inhibited glucose-stimulated insulin release (278, 279). In contrast, glucose-induced insulin secretion from rat islets was not inhibited by a myristoylated peptide inhibitor of the α- and β-isoforms of PKC (200), or by the indolocarbazole Gö 6976 (279), which shows selectivity for the conventional isoforms of PKC [α, β, γ (191)]. These observations might suggest that nutrient-induced insulin secretion requires the activation of a PKC isoform(s) other than the Ca²⁺/DAG-sensitive conventional isoforms, although maximal inhibition of PKC by Ro 31–8220 reduced glucose-induced secretory responses by only 50%, implying the existence of another, PKC-independent pathway(s).

Studies of the physiological functions of PKC have been greatly assisted by the phenomenon of down-regulation of PKC activity by prolonged exposure to PKC-activating phorbol esters, as described in Section II.C, which produces cells deficient in some DAG-sensitive isoforms. Measurements of enzyme activity show marked reductions (>90%) in DAG-dependent PKC activity in islets and β-cells after overnight exposure to phorbol esters (e.g., Refs. 91, 102, 104, 273, and 280), which is accompanied by the loss of immunoreactive α-, δ-, and ε-isoforms of PKC but not, surprisingly, of the DAG-sensitive βII isoform (111). The total loss of secretory responsiveness of PKC down-regulated β-cells to DAG analogs

implies that α-, δ-, and ε-isoforms may be involved in regulating secretion, but the DAG-sensitive βII isoform that persists after PMA treatment plays no important role in secretion in response to these agents. As would be expected, expression of the atypical PKC isoforms (ζ, ι/λ, and μ) was unaffected in β-cells after 24 h exposure to the phorbol ester (111).

PKC down-regulated β-cells have been used extensively to investigate the role played by phorbol ester-sensitive isoforms of PKC in the potentiation of insulin secretion by hormones and neurotransmitters, and these studies have, in general, shown good agreement among different laboratories. PKC depletion of islets or HIT-T15 cells resulted in reduced secretory responses to cholinergic agonists (102, 216, 281, 282) to CCK (273, 283), and to AVP (216). In contrast, PKC depletion enhanced secretory responses of RINm5F cells to CCh and AVP (92), which may reflect the expression in this cell line of different PKC isoforms to those expressed in normal β-cells (106). This approach has also been applied to studies of nutrient-induced insulin secretion, and there is, as always, some disagreement in the literature. Several different groups have reported that PKC-depleted islets mount similar secretory responses to control islets treated with inactive phorbol esters, whether challenged with glucose (e.g., Refs. 101, 103, 135, 169, and 281) or glyceraldehyde (267). In contrast, down-regulation of PKC has been reported to cause a marked reduction in the second phase of glucose-induced secretion from perfused mouse islets (104), although this effect was not observed in similar studies using mouse (103) or rat islets (281) in which neither phase of the secretory response to nutrients was significantly inhibited by PKC depletion. Confusing effects of nutrients have been reported in studies using the glucose-insensitive RINm5F cell line, in which glyceraldehyde-stimulated insulin secretion has been reported to be either decreased (91) or increased (92) in PKC-depleted cells.

What model could encompass the confusing and sometimes conflicting observations using PKC activators, inhibitors, and PKC down-regulation? The stimulus-response coupling of nonnutrients through PKC to a secretory response seems to be fairly well established. Thus, there is general agreement using all of these experimental approaches that PKC activation is required for a full response to receptor-mediated secretagogues that are linked to PLC: such stimuli generate DAG, activate and translocate PKC, and induce PKC-dependent phosphorylation of endogenous substrates; their effects are blocked by a range of PKC inhibitors; and down-regulation studies have identified one or more of the α-, δ-, and ε-isoforms as the proteins mediating these responses to nonnutrients in β-cells. In contrast, our view is that these isoforms of PKC do not play an important role in the initiation of secretory responses to nutrients. Thus, the evidence that nutrients activate the DAG-sensitive isoforms of PKC is not entirely convincing, and down-regulation studies do not support an obligatory role for DAG-sensitive isoforms in the initiation of nutrient-induced secretion. However, this conclusion does not preclude a role for PKC in nutrient-induced insulin secretion: PKC down-regulation experiments tell us nothing about the DAG-insensitive ζ-, ι/λ-, and μ- isoforms that are expressed in

β-cells (108, 111, 113, 114), and we cannot ignore the evidence of inhibition of nutrient-induced secretion by PKC inhibitors, particularly the more recently developed PKC-selective compounds. If a DAG-insensitive atypical PKC isoform(s) is involved in the response to nutrients, the reported inhibitory effects of Ro 31–8220 on glucose-induced insulin secretion could be explained by its effects on all PKC isoforms — conventional, novel and atypical — whereas the observed lack of effect of Gö 6976 reflects its selectivity for inhibition of conventional isoforms.

We therefore propose a model (Figure 3) in which nutrients stimulate insulin secretion partly through the activation of an atypical isoform(s) of PKC (ζ, ι/λ, and/or μ), whereas the potentiation of nutrient-induced secretion by PLC-activating nonnutrients is transduced through the activation of one or more of the α-, δ-, and/or ε-isoforms. The intracellular mechanisms by which nutrients could activate atypical PKC isoforms in islets are unknown, but one possible candidate is phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate, which has been shown to activate PKC ζ *in vitro* (284) and to be generated in islets by the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase in response to nutrients (285).

Our implication of atypical PKC isoforms in nutrient-induced insulin secretion depends, to a large extent, upon the selectivity or otherwise of PKC inhibitors, and our understanding of the physiological functions subserved by the PKC isoforms expressed in β-cells will be advanced when truly isoform-selective inhibitors and activators of PKC become available, or when alternative methods of reducing PKC isoform expression in β-cells are perfected (203).

### D. Mitogen-activated protein kinases

MAPK cascades have been implicated in signal transduction pathways in many mammalian cells, including specialized secretory cells that are not mitogenically responsive, such as adrenal chromaffin cells (286). To date, little information is available on the regulation and roles of the MAPK cascade in β-cells, and Fig. 4 shows a speculative model of how extracellular signals may be transduced through MAPK in β-cells. Both glucose and PMA are reported to increase the activity of the 44-kDa MAPK isoform in the INS-1 β-cell line, but MAPK activation did not stimulate insulin secretion (118). Similarly, activation of MAPK by inhibiting phosphotyrosine phosphatases in rat islets of Langerhans did not stimulate insulin secretion (117), while inhibition of MAPK activity by using PD098059 to prevent MEK activation did not affect islet (287) or INS-1 cell (288) secretory responses to nutrients, confirming that MAPK activation is neither sufficient nor essential for regulated insulin secretion. If the MAPKs are not involved in insulin secretion, they may be

![Figure 3](#fig3)

**FIG. 3.** PKC isoforms and the regulation of insulin secretion. A number of PKC isoforms are expressed in β-cells, including the DAG-dependent α-, β-, δ-, and ε-isoforms, and the DAG-independent ζ-, ι-, and μ-isoforms. The schematic diagram shows how these classes of isoforms may be involved in the regulation of insulin secretion, although little information is yet available about individual isoforms. **Nutrients:** glucose enters the β-cell and induces depolarization and Ca²⁺ entry as described in the legend to Fig. 1. Some unknown consequence (?) of glucose metabolism may activate one or more of the atypical isoforms of PKC (ζ, ι, μ), leading to phosphorylation of substrates (PO₄) and insulin secretion. **Nonnutrients:** agonists such as ACh, CCK, or bombesin bind to cell surface receptors that are coupled via the heterotrimeric G protein Gq to PLC. Receptor occupancy activates PLC with the consequent generation of IP₃ and DAG by the hydrolysis of PIP₂. Ca²⁺ released from the endoplasmic reticulum by IP₃ may be important for activation of the conventional α- and β-isoforms, and the DAG can activate the conventional (α and β) and novel (δ and ε) isoforms of PKC.

![Figure 4](#fig4)

**FIG. 4.** Possible routes for the activation of MAPK in β-cells. The schematic diagram depicts several routes through which elements of the MAPK cascade could be activated to influence β-cell function. The tyrosine kinase (TK) activity of receptors for insulin or insulin-like growth factor-1 is activated on receptor occupancy, leading to the phosphorylation of a number of adaptor proteins (AP) on tyrosine residues (Y). Other receptors, such as those for GH or PRL, recruit cytosolic tyrosine kinases (such as JAK2) that phosphorylate the adaptor proteins. The phosphorylated adaptor proteins (AP-Y-P) interact with other transduction elements, including the low molecular mass G protein ras, leading to the activation of the kinase, raf-1. Raf-1 phosphorylates and activates the dual specificity protein kinase, MEK, which in turn activates MAPK by phosphorylation on threonine and tyrosine residues. Activated MAPK may regulate secretory or proliferative responses by phosphorylating specific target proteins (PO₄) within the β-cell. Nonmitogenic agonists operating through seven membrane-spanning domain receptors may also activate the MAPK cascade. Receptor-operated activation of PLC or AC results in the activation of PKC by DAG, or of PKA by cAMP, respectively. PKC and/or PKA phosphorylate the upstream regulatory kinase MEKK which then phosphorylates and activates MEK. All of the elements of these cascades have been identified in β-cells, although their physiological functions remain to be determined.

involved in other $\beta$-cell responses. Induction of early response genes ($junB$, $nur77$, and $zif268$) in INS-1 cells is associated with MAPK activation (118), perhaps suggestive of a role for MAPKs in proliferative responses. If $\beta$-cell MAPKs are involved in the regulation of proliferation, then the reported differences in the activation of the 44-kDa MAPK between INS-1 cells (118) and rat islets of Langerhans (117) may reflect the different proliferative states of $\beta$-cell lines and $\beta$-cells in adult islets. The activation state of the 44-kDa MAPK may therefore provide a future target for the experimental manipulation of $\beta$-cell proliferation, which could have important therapeutic implications.

Even less is known of the role(s) of RK and SAP kinases in $\beta$-cells. Stimulatory concentrations of glucose increased the activity of RK in MIN6 cells (289), and activation of this stress-activated pathway may be involved in insulin gene transcription through the phosphorylation and activation of IUF1, a $\beta$-cell transcription factor (289). In contrast, in INS-1 $\beta$-cells glucose alone (15 mM) had little or no effect on RK activity, although a small increase in activity was detected when forskolin was present (288). The physiological roles of MAPKs, RK, and SAP kinases in $\beta$-cells are potentially rewarding areas to which future effort should be directed.

state of a number of islet proteins, it had no effect on basal insulin secretion (117, 294), although higher concentrations of vanadate did cause some enhancement of glucose-induced insulin secretion, an effect that was attributed to alterations in membrane potential, PI metabolism, and Ca${}^{2+}$-handling in the $\beta$-cells (294).

To date, most studies of the functional significance of PTK activation and tyrosine phosphorylation have been based on inhibitors of PTK activities and these have, as always, produced conflicting results. Such studies have produced some evidence that PTKs are involved in receptor-operated modulation of insulin secretion: the PTK inhibitor genistein has been reported to prevent the inhibitory effects of interleukin-1$\beta$ on insulin release (295), probably by inhibiting the activation of nuclear factor $\kappa B$ (296) and reducing NO production (295, 297, 298).

The use of inhibitors has not produced a consensual view of the involvement of PTKs in $\beta$-cell responses to nutrients. Thus, the PTK inhibitor genistein had stimulatory effects on insulin secretion from INS-1 cells (299), HIT-T15 cells (300), neonatal rat islets (301), and adult mouse islets (302), suggesting that PTKs exert a tonic inhibitory effect on the secretory process. However, PTK inhibitors have also been reported to have no effect on secretion (300), to inhibit glucose-stimulated insulin secretion from HIT-T15 cells (300) and rat islets (303), to inhibit CCh and glucose-induced insulin secretion from $\beta$TC3 cells (128), and to inhibit GLP-1 and glucose-stimulated secretion from RIN 1046–38 cells (186). Some of the confusion undoubtedly arises from nonspecific effects of the inhibitors being used. PTK inhibitors have diverse effects on metabolic processes unrelated to the inhibition of PTK activity (304), and it has been suggested that the stimulation of insulin release by genistein is unrelated to inhibition of PTKs (302). As for the protein serine/threonine kinases, interpretations of the physiological functions of PTKs based solely on the use of inhibitors should be viewed with caution.

Investigations in this area are currently limited by a lack of information on the precise nature of the PTKs expressed in $\beta$-cells and of the signal transduction mechanisms by which they are regulated. The activation of PTKs in response to physiological insulin secretagogues and the potential roles of PTKs in regulating $\beta$-cell secretory and proliferative responses merit much more detailed study, since these pathways may offer potential for therapeutic intervention.

E. Protein tyrosine kinases

There is relatively little information available at present on the regulation of PTK activities in pancreatic $\beta$-cells by insulin secretagogues, although some PTK substrates have been identified, and the speculative model shown in Fig. 4 contains both receptor and cytosolic PTKs. The insulin receptor is probably one of the most studied mammalian PTKs, and the recent detection of insulin receptor mRNA and of the insulin receptor substrate (IRS-1) protein in $\beta$-cells (290) implies that insulin may modulate $\beta$-cell function by autocrine interactions, a notion that has not been considered seriously since the report over a decade ago that normal $\beta$-cells do not express high-affinity receptors for insulin (291). In $\beta$TC3 cells and rat islets, glucose or insulin-like growth factor I enhanced the tyrosine phosphorylation of a 97-kDa protein identified as the insulin receptor $\beta$-subunit (127) and of the 170/180 kDa insulin receptor substrates IRS-1 and IRS-2 (124, 127), while glucose enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of an unidentified 125-kDa substrate (128).

The consequences to the secretory process of increased changes in the tyrosine phosphorylation state of islet proteins are not always clear. Receptor-mediated activation of PTKs either stimulates (292) or has no effect on (126, 293) insulin release from cell lines and neonatal or adult islets. An alternative approach is to enhance tyrosine phosphorylation of a wide range of islet proteins by inhibiting tyrosine phosphatases with vanadate or tungstate (117, 294). In a recent study using mouse islets, this was accompanied by increased production of inositol phosphates and inositol phospholipids, effects that were attributed to increased tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of PLC$\gamma$ and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, respectively (125). However, the vanadate-induced inhibition of tyrosine phosphatases can be dissociated from insulin secretion. Under conditions in which vanadate caused marked increases in the tyrosine phosphorylation

V. Protein Phosphatases and Protein Dephosphorylation in $\beta$-Cells

Protein phosphorylation is a reversible reaction, and the phosphorylation state of a protein is dependent upon the balance between the rate of its phosphorylation by protein kinases and its dephosphorylation by phosphoprotein phosphatases (PPs). The activity of PPs was originally thought to be unregulated, but it is now clear that some classes of PP are controlled by extracellular signals and are thus positioned to play key roles in the regulation of cellular processes (305, 306). Very little information is currently available about the types of tyrosine-PPs expressed in pancreatic $\beta$-cells. Two

closely related proteins, IA-2 and phogrin (IA-2β), with sequence homology to tyrosine PPs have been identified in a variety of insulinoma cell lines and in islets (307–309), and phogrin has been localized to the membranes of insulin-secretory granules (308). Intriguingly, some patients with IDDM possess antibodies to these proteins, suggesting that they may be important islet cell antigens (309). More is known about the structure, function, and occurrence of serine/threonine-PPs than about tyrosine-PPs, and we will therefore concentrate on what is known about serine/threonine-PPs in the regulation of β-cell function, but the potential importance of tyrosine-PPs should be borne in mind, particularly if PTKs prove to play an important role in β-cell regulation (Section IV.E). Many excellent reviews are available on the structure and function of PPs (*e.g.*, Refs. 305, 306, and 310–313); therefore, we will merely give a brief overview of the different classes of these enzymes before concentrating on their expression and function in β-cells.

A. Serine/threonine protein phosphatases

Serine/threonine-PPs have broad and overlapping substrate specificities, so their classification has generally been based both on substrates and on inhibitors of the enzymes. Using such criteria, four major serine/threonine-PPs have been identified (310). Type 1 PPs (PP1) specifically dephosphorylate the β-subunit of phosphorylase kinase and are inhibited by nanomolar concentrations of the thermostable proteins, inhibitor-1 (I-1) and inhibitor-2 (I-2) (310). Type 2 PPs (PP2), which preferentially dephosphorylate the α-subunit of phosphorylase kinase, are unaffected by the PP1 inhibitor proteins and are further subdivided into three groups of enzymes. PP2A, like PP1, does not have an absolute requirement for divalent cations for its activation, although PP2B and PP2C are dependent on Ca²⁺/CaM and Mg²⁺, respectively. Two heat-stable inhibitor proteins of PP2A have been purified from bovine kidney: they show no homology to I-1 and I-2, are products of distinct genes, and show negligible inhibitory activity toward PP1, PP2B, and PP2C (314). PP1 and PP2A are homologous and highly conserved proteins with catalytic subunits of molecular mass 36–37 kDa. The catalytic subunit of PP2B shows ~40% homology to those of PP1 and PP2A and is much larger (61 kDa). PP2B is a heterodimer, consisting of the catalytic domain coupled to a CaM-binding subunit. PP2C is unrelated in structure to the other enzymes, and this is taken as evidence of two distinct gene families. At least two isoforms of each serine/threonine-PP are known to be present in mammalian cells (see Ref. 310).

ing to PP1 and PP2A have also been detected in mouse and rat islets and in RINm5F cells (319, 321, 322). There are no reports yet of the detection of PP2C in islets or β-cells.

It is not yet known whether PP1 and 2A are constitutively active in β-cells, or whether their activities can be regulated. In other tissues there is some evidence that the activity of PP1 is indirectly inhibited by cAMP through the activation of PKA, which phosphorylates I-1, greatly increasing its inhibitory potency for PP1 (305). In contrast, early studies using islet homogenates detected a cAMP-stimulated PP activity (67, 315), although cAMP and cyclic GMP were later reported to have no effect on PP activity in islet homogenates (316, 317). More recently, sulfonylureas have been reported to cause a dose-dependent inhibition of PP1/2A activities in islet homogenates (323). There have been a number of experiments examining the effects of insulin secretagogues on PP activation in intact β-cells and islets. In studies using intact RINm5F cells, forskolin did not consistently affect PP1/2A activities (324), although other studies using intact tissues have suggested that insulin secretagogues may affect the activities of PP1 and PP2A (320, 324, 325). Glucose is reported to cause a transient increase in PP1/2A activities in islets (320, 325), although arginine and KCl have been reported to decrease PP1/2A activities in RINm5F β-cells (324). It has also been reported that carboxymethylation of the catalytic subunit of PP2A, associated with increased catalytic activity, resulted in an inhibition of nutrient-stimulated insulin secretion, suggestive of a negative modulatory role for PP2A in the insulin-secretory process (326).

Most of the evidence implicating PPs in β-cell secretory responses has been obtained using PP inhibitors, and the same caveats should be applied to these studies as to studies using inhibitors of protein kinases (Section IV). Okadaic acid (OA) is a C₃₈ polyether fatty acid inhibitor of PP1 and PP2A activities, which has been used to demonstrate the existence of substrate proteins for PP1 and 2A in rat islets (327). It has been proposed that one of these is the voltage-activated L-type Ca²⁺ channel, since in RINm5F cells OA induced increased Ca²⁺ influx through these channels (328), and this was accompanied by increased insulin secretion (328, 329). However, OA is also reported to stimulate insulin secretion from permeabilized islets maintained at a stimulatory Ca²⁺ concentration (327) and to enhance exocytosis in single β-cells with minimal effects on Ca²⁺ current (321), suggesting that it has effects on the secretory system other than enhancing Ca²⁺ influx. The picture is further complicated by observations in rat islets that OA does not affect basal insulin release, but inhibits glucose-stimulated insulin release (319, 327), suggesting that PP1 and/or PP2A activities are required for stimulated insulin secretion.

Given the many potential sites of action of protein kinases in the secretory pathway (Section III.B), and the broad substrate specificities of PP1 and PP2A, it seems likely that global inhibition of PP1/2A activities would affect many stages of the stimulus-secretion pathway, and the disparate effects of OA on the secretory process could be encompassed by a model in which PP1 and/or PP2A have several sites of action, including 1) An early excitatory/permissive effect in secretory responses of whole cells to nutrients, the inhibition of which by OA would result in the inhibition of nutrient-

B. Protein phosphatases in β-cells

Islets and β-cell lines express several types of protein phosphatase (Table 1). Early reports of Ca²⁺-stimulated PP activity in homogenates or subcellular fractions prepared from rat islets (315–317) were presumably measuring the activity of PP2B and have been supported by the immunological detection in rat islets and MIN6 β-cells of calcineurin/PP2B (318–320) and of enzymically active PP2B in MIN6 β-cells (320). Enzyme activities and immunoreactivities correspond-

induced secretion. 2) An inhibitory effect close to the point of depolarization-induced Ca²⁺ entry, the blocking of which would enhance Ca²⁺ influx and insulin release. This could be a direct effect on a VDCC subunit. 3) An inhibitory effect at a more distal site(s) in the stimulus-secretion coupling pathway, the blocking of which would result in enhanced basal and stimulated secretory responses. This could be via one or more of the proteins involved in secretory granule docking and fusion. The apparent discrepancy in responses of RINm5F cells between studies (328, 329) may reflect differences in the relative importance of these putative sites in a glucose-insensitive cell line.

Inhibitors have also been used to investigate the role of the Ca²⁺-dependent PP2B in secretory responses to Ca²⁺-mobilizing stimuli. Cyclosporin A (CsA) inhibited PP2B activity and increased protein phosphorylation in MIN6 cells, and this was accompanied by enhanced secretory responses of MIN6 and HIT-T15 β-cells to glucose, tolbutamide, and KCl (320). In contrast, CsA was reported to have no effect on either basal or glucose-stimulated insulin secretion from rat islets, although the efficacy of CsA was not confirmed by measurements of PP2B activity in this study (319). The PP2B inhibitors, deltamethrin and calcineurin autoinhibitory peptide, are both reported to abolish the inhibitory effects of somatostatin and galanin on Ca²⁺-induced capacitance increases in single mouse β-cells (330), suggesting that PP2B activation and the consequent dephosphorylation events are important in the inhibition of insulin secretion by receptor-mediated agonists. If substantiated, these observations imply a pivotal role for the phosphorylation event regulated by somatostatin and galanin being at a late stage of the secretory process (Section III.B). PP2B has also been implicated in the regulation of gene transcription in β-cells. cAMP response element-mediated gene transcription in HIT cells was inhibited by CsA and another PP2B inhibitor, FK506 (331, 332), and AVP has been reported to induce CsA- and FK506-sensitive phosphorylation and activation of the CRE-binding protein in these cells (333).

Since protein phosphorylation is an important process in the regulation of insulin secretion, protein dephosphorylation via PPs is required, either to switch off linear transduction cascades or to maintain the activity of cycling systems (Figure 5). The important, and as yet largely unanswered, question is whether the PPs themselves offer a point of regulation. Future studies directed toward whether, and through what mechanisms, physiologically relevant insulin secretagogues modulate the activities of β-cell PPs should go a long way toward answering this question.

VI. Protein Kinase-Independent Secretory Pathways

Pancreatic β-cells are adapted for the specialized purpose of synthesizing and secreting insulin and, given the importance of protein phosphorylation as a general mechanism of cellular regulation, there is no doubt that protein kinases *per se* are involved in the insulin-secretory process. The evidence presented in this review further suggests that some regulated protein kinases are involved in β-cell responses to both nutrient and nonnutrient secretagogues, and that these kinases

FIG. 5. Phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of substrate proteins. Protein kinases and PPs are both involved in regulation of the phosphorylation state of substrate proteins and the activation/inhibition of protein kinases, and PPs can be predicted to produce different effects in different models. *Upper panel*, The linear transduction model. In this model the magnitude of the functional response is proportional to the *accumulation* of phosphorylated (PO₄) substrate. For example, the substrate might be an enzyme whose activity is dependent upon phosphorylation, and the response would be an increased production of the enzyme product. Activation of the kinase will initiate or enhance the response, and the effects of kinase activation will be enhanced by inhibition of the phosphatase. If there is no kinase activity under physiological resting conditions, phosphatase inhibitors alone will have no effect. However, if there is a finite kinase activity under unstimulated conditions, phosphatase inhibitors alone will enhance the response over basal. *Lower panel*, The cycling transduction model. In this model the magnitude of response is proportional to the *rate* of phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of the substrate. For example, the substrate may be a transporter protein whose movement back and forth across a membrane barrier is dependent upon its phosphorylation and subsequent dephosphorylation, and the response would be movement of the transported substance from one side of the membrane to the other. Activation of the kinase will initiate or enhance the response as long as the phosphatase activity does not become rate limiting. If phosphatase inhibitors reduce phosphatase activity to such an extent that it becomes rate-limiting, they will reduce the response to kinase activation. Total inhibition of phosphatase activity will block the response to kinase activators. If there is no kinase activity under resting conditions, phosphatase inhibitors alone will have no effect. However, if there is a finite kinase activity under resting conditions, phosphatase inhibitors alone may reduce basal response.

may act as focal regulatory points through which a variety of dissimilar extracellular signals are transduced into regulated secretory responses. However, the question remains whether activation of these kinases is obligatory for insulin secretion, or whether there may exist within the β-cell physiologically relevant signal transduction pathways that are independent of kinase activation.

Studies using selective kinase inhibitors indicate that PKA and PKC are the sole response elements in the stimulation of insulin secretion by cAMP and DAG analogs, respectively (137, 163, 198). These observations suggest that kinase activation is indeed obligatory for secretory responses to those receptor-operated nonnutrients that enhance insulin secretion.

tion primarily through activating AC or PLC. In contrast, some studies using CaMK inhibitors or CaM antagonists suggest that increases in cytosolic $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ may stimulate insulin secretion through mechanisms other than the activation of CaMKs. Thus, $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-induced insulin secretion from permeabilized $\beta$-cells was not inhibited by high concentrations of the CaM antagonists W7 and TFP (334) or by the CaMK II inhibitor KN-62 (228); the CaM inhibitor calmidazolium attenuated stimulus-dependent increases in $\beta$-cell $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ but stimulated insulin secretion (335); and KN-62 and the inhibitory peptide CaMK$_{290-309}$ produced only partial (55–60%) inhibition of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-induced capacitance increases in mouse $\beta$-cells (164). These observations implicate the involvement of a $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-sensitive protein(s), in addition to CaMK II, in generating secretory responses to $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$. Pancreatic $\beta$-cells express many $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-sensitive proteins that may be involved in signal transduction, although a detailed analysis of their functions is beyond the scope of this review. However, on current evidence, likely candidates include the 100-kDa cPLA$_2$ (123, 336–338), which generates AA upon $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-dependent activation; and the SNARES, such as VAMP and SNAP-25, which are thought to be involved in the $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-dependent docking and/or fusion of insulin-containing secretory granules at the site of exocytosis (182, 184, 186).

The existence of a kinase-independent component of the secretory response to $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ could explain the commonly reported, but seldom commented upon, observation that protein kinase inhibitors often do not fully inhibit secretory responses to the nutrient secretagogues that operate primarily by increasing intracellular $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$. For example, the kinase inhibitors TFP (20 $\mu$M) (225), chlorpromazine (100 $\mu$M) (81), dibucaine (500 $\mu$M) (81), H-7 (50 $\mu$M) (268), clomiphene (50 $\mu$M) (272), and KN-62 (10 $\mu$M) (229, 230) all produced a less than total inhibition of glucose-induced insulin release. Furthermore, several studies using staurosporine, a relatively nonselective kinase inhibitor, have demonstrated that the inhibition of glucose-induced insulin secretion was not complete even in the presence of supramaximal concentrations of staurosporine (89, 270, 271, 283). The simplest explanation for these observations is that kinase activation is an important part of normal secretory responses to nutrients, but that it cannot alone account for the full secretory response to $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-mobilizing nutrient stimuli. It is unclear at present whether the kinase-dependent, inhibitor-sensitive component of the response reflects insulin release from a different pool of secretory granules to the kinase-independent component, or whether it is an earlier stage in a single secretory process, such as moving the secretory granules to a release site, or rendering the granules competent for exocytosis. Identifying the components of the kinase-independent regulatory pathways will lead to a better understanding of the secretory process and may identify new therapeutic targets through which to manipulate insulin release.

Under certain experimental circumstances it is possible to produce an apparently regulated insulin-secretory response without any requirement for kinase activation, by exposing $\beta$-cells to the amphiphilic peptide mastoparan (MP) (339–343), to the neuronal protein myelin basic protein (MBP) (344, 345), or to the unsaturated fatty acid AA (261, 346). Although they are structurally very different, the effects of these agents

on the $\beta$-cell are similar in many respects. Thus, they initiate secretory responses that do not require an influx of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, are not ATP-dependent, and are resistant to a wide variety of protein kinase inhibitors (340–342, 344). Their similar effects imply a similar mode of action, and this may be by generating, or acting as, fusogens at the last stage in exocytosis. MBP associates with islet cell membranes (345), where it may act as a direct fusogen or generate other fusogens. MP has been shown to interact with membrane-associated low molecular mass and heterotrimeric G proteins (347, 348). In addition, MP stimulated the GTPase activity in insulin-secretory granules (343), and both this effect and that on the stimulation of insulin secretion were blocked by pertussis toxin (339, 341, 343). Finally, MP-induced insulin secretion was blocked by inhibitors of phospholipases, the class of enzymes that generate AA (339, 341). These observations are consistent with a model in which MP (and perhaps MBP) stimulates insulin secretion by activating a G protein-coupled phospholipase, perhaps on the secretory granule membrane, to generate a fusogenic substance such as AA. The effects of substances such as MP, MBP, and AA are unlikely to be totally specific and in any case are sufficiently nonphysiological to merit some degree of caution in extrapolating their mode(s) of action to those of physiological secretagogues. However, there is also evidence that glucose can regulate insulin secretion through a mechanism that is independent of changes in membrane potential or changes in cytosolic $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, and which does not require the activation of PKA or PKC (349). The nature of this regulatory mechanism and its physiological relevance are as yet uncertain, but a fuller understanding should provide insights into the secretory process in general and into the importance of regulated kinases in that process.

VII. Summary and Future Perspectives

From the evidence presented in this review there is no doubt that protein kinases play vital roles in the regulation of insulin secretion from pancreatic $\beta$-cells. Most of the published studies concur with a model for insulin secretion (Figure 6) in which $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-regulated protein kinases are involved in the initiation of insulin-secretory responses by the physiologically important nutrient secretagogues, although other $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-sensitive response elements may also be required for a full secretory response. In this consensus model, kinases from the PKA and PKC families are vitally important for the modulation of secretory responses by receptor-operated, nonnutrient secretagogues, but their involvement in nutrient-induced insulin secretion is still a matter of debate. Definitive evidence is not yet available about the involvement of other kinase transduction pathways in the regulation of insulin secretion, including the MAPK cascade and those operating through tyrosine kinases/phosphatases.

Part of the uncertainty about the roles of protein kinases in $\beta$-cells can be attributed to the expression of multiple isoforms of these enzymes, and this highlights an important question for future studies: what is the functional significance of protein kinase isoforms in $\beta$-cells? The answer may be complex and may differ for each class of protein kinase.

methods for the detection, activation, and inhibition of individual protein kinase isoforms.

Despite the overwhelming evidence of kinase involvement in the secretory process, we are still largely ignorant of the identity and functions of the kinase substrates (Section III.B), and this ignorance highlights another important question for future studies: is there a pivotal phosphoprotein, or a group of phosphoproteins, through which all kinase-activating external stimuli converge to influence the secretory process? The lack of a definitive answer to this question at present is probably due to limitations in current experimental approaches. Attempts to detect important substrates by measuring changes in phosphorylation of endogenous proteins may detect transduction elements in which the mass of phosphoprotein increases (Figure 5, upper panel) but will not necessarily detect changes in the flux of phosphate through the substrate, which may be equally important (Figure 5, lower panel). More immediately useful information can be gained by adopting the “candidate protein” approach in which the phosphorylation of substrates known to be involved in transduction cascades is measured, although this approach is inherently unlikely to identify novel pathways or mechanisms. The rapid recent advances in cell and molecular biology are presenting ever more candidate proteins for this approach, and our ultimate understanding of the role of protein phosphorylation in the regulation of insulin secretion is probably dependent upon the application to β-cells of conceptual advances made in more experimentally accessible tissues.

As the sequencing of the human genome proceeds ever more rapidly, current estimates suggest that it may contain coding sequences for more than 1000 protein kinases. The 361 studies referred to in this review have produced only limited insight into the function of a few of these enzymes in pancreatic β-cells. There is clearly much work to be done.

FIG. 6. Protein kinases and the regulation of insulin secretion. The schematic diagram shows a consensual model of the involvement of protein kinases in the regulation of insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells, incorporating elements from Figs. 1–4. Nutrient secretagogues influence the secretory process through the activation of CaMKII as a consequence of an influx of extracellular Ca²⁺. Receptor-operated nonnutrients that are coupled to PLC may activate CaMK by the IP₃-induced release of Ca²⁺ from intracellular stores and activate conventional and/or novel isoforms of PKC by the generation of DAG. Other receptor-operated nonnutrients that are coupled to AC activate PKA by increasing intracellular concentrations of cAMP. Growth factors or nonmitogenic agonists may influence insulin secretion or β-cell proliferation through a cascade of protein kinases that results in the activation of MAPK.

example, the different isoforms of CaMK II expressed in β-cells (Section II.A) are subject to the same mechanism of regulation by Ca²⁺/CaM and, so far as is known, are found in the same locations within the cell, although the truncated γ-isoform (63) may have access to areas denied the full-length enzymes. In this case the existence of similar isoforms from independent genes may simply reflect a fail-safe adaptation to ensure the expression of active and regulatable CaMK activity in the event of deleterious mutations of the gene encoding one isoform. The isoforms of PKA are also subject to the same mechanism of regulation of enzymic activity, in this case by the availability of cAMP, but the subcellular localization of PKA activity is determined by the isoform of the regulatory subunit within the holoenzyme (Section II.B). The expression of PKA isoforms, or at least those of the regulatory subunit, may therefore exist to subserve specific functions, and the regulation of activity, substrate specificity, and cellular function may be determined as much by cellular location as by the isoform structure. The PKC family of isoforms differs from CaMK and PKA in that subgroups of isoforms are subject to different mechanisms of regulation and may be confined to different intracellular compartments (Section II.C). One explanation for this diversity is that the subgroups of PKC isoforms (conventional, novel, atypical) have evolved to subserve specific and different functions within β-cells, in which case experimental studies of PKC function should be directed toward individual isoforms, or at least isoform subgroups, to produce interpretable information. Substantial insights into protein kinase function in β-cells will be dependent upon the development of novel

Seventh Annual Symposium on the Design & Methods of Clinical Trials
October 22–23, 1998
San Francisco, California

Now in its seventh year, this program is oriented to clinicians and researchers who are involved in the design,
implementation, or evaluation of clinical trials. Participants will gain a working understanding of a research
protocol and execution of the study plan. The impact of clinical trials on patient care will also be addressed.

The format features lectures and discussion with faculty. Major topics to be covered include:

Design Options for Clinical Trials
Analytic and Reporting Issues in Clinical Trials
Ethical Issues, Adherence, and Quality-of-Life Assessments
Critical Evaluation of Published Reports of Clinical Trial Results

Chaired by Dennis M. Black, Ph.D., this program is presented by the Department of Epidemiology and
Biostatistics of the University of California School of Medicine at San Francisco. The program is sponsored
by UCSF’s Office of Continuing Medical Education.

UCSF is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education. This program will meet
the criteria for Category 1 credit.
