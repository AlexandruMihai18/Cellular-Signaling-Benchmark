### ABSTRACT

NADPH-dependent reduction of 2′,7-dihydroxy-4′,5′-methylenedioxyisoflavone to the isoflavanone sophorol, a proposed intermediate step in pisatin biosynthesis, was detected in extracts of *Pisum sativum*. This isoflavone reductase activity was inducible by treatment of pea seedlings with CuCl₂. The timing of induction coincided with that of the 6a-hydroxymaackiain 3-O-methyltransferase, which catalyzes the terminal biosynthetic step. Neither enzyme was light inducible. Further NADPH-dependent metabolism of sophorol by extracts of CuCl₂-treated seedlings was also observed; three products were radiolabeled when [³H]sophorol was the substrate, one of which is tentatively identified as maackiain.

The pterocarpan (+)pisatin is the major phytoalexin synthesized by *Pisum sativum*. In the disease of *P. sativum* caused by *Nectria haematococca*, genetic studies on the fungus suggest that the ability of fungal isolates to detoxify pisatin is necessary for high virulence on pea plants (19). These results imply that pisatin is an effective barrier to non-detoxifying fungal isolates and is important in the defense of pea against microbial attack.

Isoflavonoid phytoalexin synthesis has been the subject of much recent study of the regulation of gene expression in plants (12). Biochemical characterization of the late steps in the pisatin pathway is a prerequisite for this type of study on pea. Banks and Dewick (1) proposed a biosynthetic pathway for (+)pisatin and (−)maackiain, a minor phytoalexin of pea (16) (Fig. 1), based on their studies of incorporation of ¹⁴C-

labeled DMI⁶, maackiain, HMK, and other compounds into pisatin. The isoflavanone sophorol was not included in the study. In recent work, we have confirmed the terminal step in the proposed pathway, having purified and characterized HMK 3-O-methyltransferase (15).

The penultimate step in pisatin biosynthesis is proposed to be the synthesis of HMK by 6a-hydroxylation of maackiain (Fig. 1). In support of this hypothesis, Banks and Dewick (1, 2) found that label from [¹⁴C]maackiain (1) and from [6,11a-²H₂]maackiain (2) was recovered in pisatin with high efficiency. In addition, a monooxygenase catalyzing pterocarpan 6a-hydroxylation has been detected in *Glycine max* (10), and analogous transformations are carried out by various fungi (3, 6, 8, 11). However, we have been unable to detect enzyme activity for this reaction in pea. Furthermore, experiments on pea with ¹⁸O indicated that the 6a oxygen in pisatin is derived from H₂O (14), whereas the 6a oxygen of glycinol from *G. max* is derived from O₂ (13), suggesting that a direct, monooxygenase-catalyzed 6a-hydroxylation may not be involved at this point in the pathway in pea. Thus, the biochemistry of the penultimate step, resulting in synthesis of HMK, is not resolved.

We have now attempted to demonstrate the presence of the two enzymes catalyzing the proposed steps in the pathway in *P. sativum* leading to maackiain, namely isoflavone reductase and pterocarpan synthase. Analogous enzymes producing (−)medicarpin, the 9-methoxy-8-unsubstituted analog of (−)maackiain, have been found in *Cicer arietinum* (4, 18). In addition, products of the metabolism of radiolabeled sophorol by cell-free extracts of pea were examined for possible intermediates of a pathway from sophorol to pisatin which bypasses maackiain. In this article, we report the detection of a CuCl₂-inducible isoflavone reductase in extracts of pea and the further NADPH-dependent metabolism of sophorol to three products.

### MATERIALS AND METHODS

#### Chemicals

Published procedures were used to obtain (+)pisatin (21), (+)- and (−)maackiain (20), (−)sophorol (8), (+)HMK (15),

⁶ Abbreviations: DMI, 2′,7-dihydroxy-4′,5′-methylenedioxyisoflavone; HMK, 6a-hydroxymaackiain.

BIOSYNTHESIS OF THE PHYTOALEXIN PISATIN

described (15). To test the possibility of induction by the exposure to light that occurred during harvesting of samples, both light and dark controls were run. The foil was lifted briefly (5 min under room light) at 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24, 30, and 36 h from seedlings receiving the intermittent light treatment (light). Seedlings receiving the CuCl₂ + light treatment (CuCl₂) were immersed in 5 mM CuCl₂ for 1 h in the dark beginning at 0 h. The CuCl₂ solution was drained off, and the foil covering was replaced and then lifted briefly at the same intervals as for the light treatment. Separate trays of dark treatment seedlings were grown, one for each designated time point, and kept sealed until harvested. Samples consisting of 1.0 g root plus shoot (minus the cotyledons) were individually wrapped in foil, frozen in liquid N₂, and stored at –80°C until used.

### Enzyme Preparation

Enzyme extracts were prepared within 24 h of sample harvest. In each experiment, duplicate extracts were prepared for each treatment-time combination. Each 1-g sample was thawed in 2 mL of 100 mM KPO₄, pH 8.0, 5 mM DTT, 5 mM EDTA, and ground with 0.5 g sand and 0.2 g PVPP in a cold (4°C) mortar and pestle. The resulting slurry was centrifuged at 12,000g for 20 min at 4°C. The supernatant was assayed immediately for isoflavone reductase and pterocarpan synthase and stored overnight at –20°C before it was assayed for HMK methyltransferase. Protein content was determined by the method of Bradford (5) with BSA as a standard.

### Enzyme Assays

Duplicate assays were run on each extract for each reaction condition. Assays for isoflavone reductase and pterocarpan synthase were modifications of protocols for analogous reactions en route to medicarpin synthesis in *Cicer arietinum* (4, 18): reactions contained 50 μM DMI or sophorol, 4 mM NADPH (Sigma Chemical Co.), and plant extract (235 μL; 0.5–0.9 mg protein) in a total volume of 250 μL. For parallel reactions at pH 7.7 and 6.0, additional buffer (250 μL) and substrates were added for a total volume of 515 μL. The additional buffers were: (a) 0.2 M KPO₄ (pH 6.0), 1 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA, final reaction pH 6.0, and (b) 0.1 M KPO₄ (pH 8.0), 5 mM DTT, 5 mM EDTA, final reaction pH 7.7. Reactions were started by addition of enzyme and continued for 15 min at 30°C. After addition of the internal standard HMK (2.5 μg in 25 μL ethanol) to samples designated for HPLC, reactions were stopped by the addition of 2 mL ethyl acetate. In experiments with parallel reactions at pH 7.7 and 6.0, 100 μL Tris-HCl (2 M, pH 7.5) was added after the ethyl acetate. After the phases were mixed, they were allowed to separate, and 1.5 mL of the organic phase was evaporated under vacuum. The residue was dissolved in ethanol or chloroform for analysis by HPLC or TLC, respectively. Units of isoflavone reductase activity are based on the amount of sophorol accumulated under these conditions with DMI as the substrate. Sophorol was quantified after HPLC by its absorbance at 309 nm relative to known amounts of standards. HMK methyltransferase was assayed as described previously (15).

### Enzyme Induction

Peas (*Pisum sativum* cv Alaska) were surface-sterilized and germinated in the dark in a tray covered with foil for 6 d as

and DMI (9). Ethanol (95%) was distilled to remove UV-absorbing contaminants.

#### [2-³H]Sophorol Synthesis

[6,11a-³H]Maackiain was synthesized from DMI by reduction with [³H]NaBH₄ by a modification of the published method (2). DMI (1.35 mg) was dissolved in 500 μL tetrahydrofuran:ethanol (50:50; v/v) and added to [³H]NaBH₄ (2.25 mg; 25 mCi). After 2 h, unlabeled NaBH₄ (30 mg) was added. [³H]Maackiain was purified by TLC as described below. This racemic maackiain was metabolized to [2-³H]sophorol (see Fig. 1) by *Nectria haematococca* isolate T-30 (8). After purification by TLC, the specific activity of sophorol was 3.22 μCi μmol⁻¹. Since sophorol produced by bioconversion in this way might be only one of the optical isomers (20; Preisig, unpublished observations), it was racemized in tetrahydrofuran by adding at least 5 mol eq NaOH. After 30 min at room temperature, an equivalent amount of HCl was added. The racemized compound was dried under argon and dissolved in methanol for use in enzyme reactions.

was dependent on NADPH and reaction time at 30°C (Fig. 2) and on the concentration of DMI (not shown). Identity of sophorol was confirmed by its UV spectra at neutral and alkaline pH (17), mass spectrum (8), and cochromatography with authentic sophorol in TLC and reverse-phase HPLC. The small amount of pisatin present was derived from the enzyme extract itself. A small amount of a compound co-chromatographing with sophorol also was detected by HPLC analysis in the enzyme preparation itself (<10% of that produced in complete reactions), suggesting the accumulation of this intermediate *in vivo*. However, sophorol was not reported in a previous study of the isoflavonoids of CuCl₂-treated pea seedlings (7).

Treatment of etiolated pea seedlings with CuCl₂ induced a 20-fold increase in isoflavone reductase activity (Fig. 3A). Induction of isoflavone reductase coincided in timing and magnitude with that of HMK methyltransferase (Fig. 3B). A small peak of isoflavone reductase activity, but not of HMK

Analytical Methods

Samples were fractionated by silica gel TLC (Analtech HPTLC-GHLF) in toluene:ethyl acetate (60:40, v/v). TLC plates were photographed under 254 nm and long-wave UV light. Prior to photography under long-wave UV, plates were left on the bench overnight, a treatment that caused maackiain (16) and pisatin to degrade to strongly fluorescent products. For fluorography of radioactive products, plates were sprayed with 10% 2,5-diphenyloxazole in diethyl ether and allowed to expose Kodak X-Omat film for up to 45 d at –80°C. For quantitation of radioactivity, plates were counted for 3 h/lane with a Berthold LB2821 TLC Linear Analyzer equipped with a position-sensitive proportional counter. The detection efficiency for \({}^{3}\)H sources was 0.4 cpm/dpm. Values reported are dpm (minus background).

HPLC analysis was carried out on a Waters NovaPak C₁₈ column. A convex solvent gradient (Waters curve 9, 18 min) from 70:30 to 30:70 (v/v) H₂O:acetonitrile was used at 2.0 ml min⁻¹. Absorbance at 309 nm was monitored. Retention times for HMK, sophorol, DMI, pisatin, and maackiain were 4.7, 6.1, 6.6, 15.3, and 15.7 min, respectively.

Mass spectra were determined by the Cornell University Mass Spectrometry Facility.

aqueous phase after ethyl acetate extraction—was observed in the complete reactions (not shown).

In this study, enzyme activity has been detected that is consistent with one of the steps proposed by Banks and Dewick (1) for the synthesis of pisatin, namely the conversion of DMI to sophorol. In addition, extracts of CuCl₂-treated pea tissue metabolized sophorol to at least three other products. One of these products, the least abundant one, appears to be maackiain, which is the product expected from the pathway proposed by Banks and Dewick (1).

The sophorol used in this study was racemic and thus both (+)- and (−)sophorol were available as substrates. Since a small amount of (−)maackiain has been detected as a phytoalexin in pea (16), the least abundant product could represent pterocarpan synthase activity specific for (−)sophorol, performing the final step in the pathway to (−)maackiain (Fig. 1). The other two products might be derived from (+)sophorol and represent intermediates in some unknown pisatin biosynthetic sequence that bypasses maackiain to produce HMK. Identifying the structure and stereochemistry of these products should help resolve these possibilities and further clarify the pathway of pisatin biosynthesis in *Pisum sativum*.
