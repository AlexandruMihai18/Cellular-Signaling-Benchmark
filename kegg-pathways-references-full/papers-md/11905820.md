# CROSS-PRESENTATION IN VIRAL IMMUNITY AND SELF-TOLERANCE

**William R. Heath* and Francis R. Carbone†**

T lymphocytes recognize peptide antigens presented by class I and class II molecules encoded by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). Classical antigen-presentation studies showed that MHC class I molecules present peptides derived from proteins synthesized within the cell, whereas MHC class II molecules present exogenous proteins captured from the environment. Emerging evidence indicates, however, that dendritic cells have a specialized capacity to process exogenous antigens into the MHC class I pathway. This function, known as cross-presentation, provides the immune system with an important mechanism for generating immunity to viruses and tolerance to self.

### ISOTYPE SWITCHING
When B cells change their class of antibody (immunoglobulin) production from one isotype to another, for example from IgM to IgG.

### THYMIC SELECTION
The process of choosing which thymocytes develop into mature T cells on the basis of the specificity of their T-cell receptors.

### PERIPHERAL TOLERANCE
The generation of tolerance to self for mature T cells that have left the thymus and are recirculating in the periphery.

T lymphocytes can be separated into two subpopulations on the basis of their expression of the cell-surface markers **CD4** and **CD8**. The CD4+ subset is primarily responsible for providing help to other immune cells through direct cell–cell interactions or the secretion of cytokines. Collaboration with B cells, for example, leads to ISOTYPE SWITCHING and enhanced antibody production. CD4+ T cells also have an important role in the induction of inflammatory responses and the generation of CD8+ T-cell immunity. Effective priming of CD8+ T cells leads to their development into mature cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), which are best known for their capacity to kill virus-infected cells. In this review, for simplicity, we will refer to CD4+ T cells as ‘helper T cells’ and CD8+ T cells as ‘CTLs’.

Helper T cells and CTLs use their T-cell receptors to recognize peptide antigens presented by molecules encoded by the MHC. Helper T cells recognize peptides presented by MHC class II molecules, whereas CTLs are restricted to MHC class I molecules. This preference for different classes of MHC molecules relates to a demarcation in the antigen-processing pathways that supply peptides. MHC class II molecules generally present peptides derived from exogenous antigens that enter the cell by the endocytic route, whereas MHC class I molecules present endogenously derived antigens, usually synthesized within the cell presenting the antigen (FIG. 1a,b).

The targeting of CTLs to endogenously synthesized antigens is important as it ensures that virus-specific CTLs only kill cells that are directly infected with virus. Bystander cells that simply endocytose viral debris from infected neighbouring cells will not process this antigen into the MHC class I pathway and will therefore not be targeted by CTLs.

Although CTLs perform the very important function of killing cells infected with viruses or intracellular bacteria, their ability to destroy target tissues comes at a price. CTLs with specificity for self-antigens can sometimes attack normal host tissues and cause autoimmunity^{1,2}. For this reason, it is very important to maintain tight control over the generation of effector CTLs, maximizing their pathogen-fighting capacity, while minimizing their autoimmune potential. Although this is primarily achieved during THYMIC SELECTION, in which most self-reactive T cells are deleted, other controls are important. Self-reactive CTLs can, for example, be regulated by PERIPHERAL TOLERANCE mechanisms^{3–7}, and also by checkpoints that prevent their maturation in the absence of signals from helper T cells^{8–10} (FIG. 2). In this review, we will examine the role of cross-presentation in the generation of CTL immunity (cross-priming) and in the maintenance of self-tolerance (cross-tolerance).

## What is cross-presentation?
Naive T cells recirculate throughout the secondary lymphoid compartment, moving between the lymph

Figure 1 | Different antigen-processing pathways for the MHC class I and class II molecules. **a** | MHC class I molecules present peptides that are primarily derived from endogenously synthesized proteins of either self or pathogen origin. These proteins are degraded into peptides by the proteasome and then transported through the transporters of antigen-processing (TAP) molecules into the endoplasmic reticulum for loading on MHC class I molecules. **b** | By contrast, MHC class II molecules present proteins that enter the cell through the endocytic route. During maturation of MHC class II molecules, they are prevented from binding to endogenous antigens in the endoplasmic reticulum by association with the invariant chain (Ii). Invariant chain–MHC class II complexes (MHC II–Ii) move through the Golgi to the MIIC/CLIV compartment where the invariant chain is degraded to CLIP (for class II-associated invariant-chain peptide). CLIP is then removed from the CLIP–MHC class II (MHC–CLIP) complexes and exchanged for antigenic peptide. **c** | Dendritic cells can endocytose antigens from other cells and cross-present them to CD8⁺ cytotoxic T lymphocytes. The TAP-dependence of such cross-presentation⁴⁴,⁵² indicates that it involves diversion of the cellular antigens into the conventional MHC class I pathway, although the mechanism(s) for this diversion are as yet undefined. In most cases, these antigens will also be processed into the MHC class II presentation pathway for recognition by CD4⁺ helper T cells. (MIIC, MHC II loading compartment; CLIV, MHC II vesicles.)

nodes, blood and spleen. This limited recirculation pattern means that many pathogens enter the body at sites where they will not directly encounter naive T cells. For their initial encounter with antigen, T cells rely on dendritic cells (DCs) to capture pathogen products from the site of infection and transport them to the draining lymph nodes. In this way, naive T cells can scan the entire body for the presence of pathogens simply by scanning antigens presented on DCs that migrate to the secondary lymphoid compartment. As well as transporting antigen, DCs express co-stimulatory molecules that allow them to activate naive T cells, classifying them as professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs). So, once a specific encounter occurs between a T cell and a DC, T cells are activated, proliferate and differentiate, and are then able to enter peripheral tissues to fight the invading pathogen.

For MHC class II-restricted responses, which are directed at exogenous antigens, it is easy to imagine how DCs can capture pathogen products and present them to MHC class II-restricted helper T cells in the draining lymph nodes. For MHC class I-restricted responses, which are generally thought to target antigens that are synthesized within the cell presenting the antigen, it becomes a little more complicated to describe the role of the DC. In the simplest case, DCs could themselves be infected with the pathogen, so allowing MHC class I-restricted presentation of pathogen-derived antigens. Not all pathogens are known to infect DCs, however, and pathogen-infected DCs are often functionally compromised¹¹⁻¹⁷. Therefore, as suggested by Bevan some years ago¹⁸, an exogenous pathway for processing MHC class I-restricted antigens within DCs might be necessary. In fact, Bevan’s hypothesis came from his discovery of such a pathway for the priming of CTL immunity¹⁹. He showed that protein antigens (in this case minor histocompatibility antigens) that were synthesized in one cell could be captured as exogenous antigens by APCs, processed into the MHC class I antigen-presentation pathway, and used to prime CTL immunity. Bevan termed this ‘cross-priming’, and we have subsequently defined the antigen-processing associated with cross-priming as ‘cross-presentation’. Cross-presentation has been previously used in two contexts in the literature. In the first case, it simply meant processing of exogenous antigens into the MHC class I pathway.

(cross-presentation) would potentially target non-infected tissue cells that endocytosed viral debris, for destruction by virus-specific CTLs. Therefore, DCs have been bestowed with a specialized property that allows them to cross-present antigens derived from other cells, for the stimulation of naive CTLs (FIG. 1c).

### Identity of the cross-priming APC

Despite the discovery of cross-priming in the mid-1970s¹⁹, the phenotype of the APC responsible for this process remained elusive for a quarter of a century. Although this cell was clearly of bone marrow origin²²,²³, and a professional APC (that is, able to activate naive T cells)¹⁸, researchers had been unable to directly identify the specific subset responsible for cross-presentation. Several groups provided evidence that DCs, macrophages and even B cells were able to cross-present antigens *in vitro* under specific circumstances²⁴–²⁹, but little success was derived from *in vivo* attempts to isolate the cross-presenting APC³⁰. Recently, however, Bevan and co-workers²¹ examined the three known splenic DC subsets (TABLE 1) and provided the first evidence that CD8⁺ DCs are responsible for cross-priming *in vivo*. In these studies, mice were injected with ovalbumin (OVA)-bearing cells (known to induce CTLs by cross-priming³¹), left for 14 hours to allow their DCs to capture and process antigen, and then DC subsets were isolated from the spleen and examined *in vitro* for their capacity to activate OVA-specific CTLs. Only the CD8⁺ DC subset cross-presented OVA under these conditions, despite evidence of antigen capture by all three DC subsets. Shortman and colleagues²⁰ later reported that soluble OVA injected intravenously was also cross-presented by CD8⁺ DCs. Again, all three subsets of splenic DCs captured OVA, but only the CD8⁺ subset cross-presented it to CTLs. Interestingly, double-negative DCs (CD8⁻CD4⁻) could be induced to cross-present OVA if exposed to the bacterial product, lipopolysaccharide, although their cross-presenting capacity was poor compared with that of the CD8⁺ DC subset.

So, why has it taken so long to identify CD8⁺ DCs as the cross-priming APC? First, CD8⁺ DCs were themselves only identified as a DC subset in 1992 (REF. 32), they were undetected prior to this because of their sensitivity to isolation procedures. Second, the capacity of this subset to capture antigens *in vivo* and then cross-present them *in vitro* is very inefficient²¹. Therefore, fragility combined with *in vitro* presentation inefficiency frustrated early attempts at identifying the cross-presenting APC. Although CD8⁺ DCs now seem to be the predominant cross-presenting subset, the presence of lipopolysaccharide did allow cross-presentation by double-negative DCs²⁰. So, perhaps different DC subsets will cross-present under different conditions.

As discussed in detail below, cross-presentation is associated with both immunity and tolerance. So far, identification of the tolerogenic cross-presenting APC has not been achieved, although Kurts and colleagues³³ recently reported that this cell is CD11c⁺, supporting the idea that it is of DC origin. More precise phenotypic definition of this DC subset must await future studies.

### Antigens and cross-presentation

How exogenous antigens enter the MHC class I pathway has been extensively reviewed elsewhere³⁴, but three general mechanisms have been defined. The first involves direct ‘injection’ of pathogen-derived antigenic material into the cytosol of host APCs (mediated by viruses³⁵ and some bacteria, such as *Listeria monocytogenes*³⁶), which allows processing of pathogen proteins by the normal cytosolic machinery for MHC class I. The second mechanism involves endosomal processing. This consists of either direct endosomal loading of preformed MHC class I molecules with peptide determinants that are generated in the endosomal compartment³⁷,³⁸ or ‘regurgitation’ of peptide antigen from the endosomal compartment onto the cell surface for association with preformed MHC class I molecules³⁹. The third mechanism of cross-presentation involves ‘cytosolic diversion’ by as yet undefined pathways. In this case, exogenous proteins are diverted from either the endosomal compartment or directly from the extracellular fluid into the cytosol for processing in the conventional MHC class I pathway. This third situation might be represented by a single mechanism or several different processes, but includes cross-presentation of heat-shock proteins⁴⁰, antibody complexes²⁵, exosomes⁴¹,⁴², apoptotic cells²⁹, necrotic cells⁴³ and macropinocytosis²⁴.

Although there are several pathways for cross-presentation, our current understanding of which pathway(s) operate *in vivo* for cross-presentation of cell-associated antigens derived from virus-infected cells or self tissues is minimal. Many types of protein antigens have been reported to be cross-presented, including nuclear⁴⁴, cytoplasmic and cell surface⁴⁵, foreign³¹ and self⁴⁵, as well as viral⁴⁶, bacterial³¹ and eukaryotic¹⁹. The level of expression by the donor cell seems to be very important for successful cross-presentation⁴⁷. Expression levels crucially dictate whether sufficient antigen will be cross-presented to stimulate CTLs. Under normal circumstances, cross-presentation is probably less efficient than direct presentation, since cross-presentation requires the additional step of transfer from one cell to another. So, to detect cross-presentation in a model system, it is important that the donor tissue expresses sufficient antigen (for an extended discussion of this important issue see REF. 30).

Apoptotic cells have been reported to be a good antigen source for cross-presentation *in vitro*²⁹,⁴⁸,⁴⁹, and whereas necrotic cells were initially thought to be excluded from cross-presentation²⁹, recent studies show that this is not the case⁴³. Although there is some evidence that necrotic cells can cross-prime *in vivo*, as illustrated by the capacity of sonicated cell debris to induce CTLs⁵⁰, there is no direct *in vivo* evidence that apoptotic cells are cross-presented. McPherson and colleagues⁵¹ report that a subset of rat DCs constitutively carry apoptotic gut epithelial cells to the mesenteric lymph

with no evidence for nibbling by non-DC cell types, such as macrophages. These observations support the possibility that DCs resident in the tissues might move from cell to cell, nibbling pieces of tissue cells without causing damage. This material could then be transported to the draining lymph node for cross-presentation to naive T cells.

### Role of cross-presentation in self-tolerance

As well as providing a mechanism for generating immunity to intracellular infections, cross-presentation has been reported to participate in tolerance induction. Von Boehmer's laboratory first reported a role for cross-presentation in CENTRAL TOLERANCE<sup>57</sup>, showing that minor histocompatibility antigens were cross-presented within the thymus, where they tolerized CTLs; a process later shown to occur by deletion<sup>58</sup>. They referred to this process as 'cross-tolerance'. More recently, cross-tolerance was observed for antigens that were expressed extra-thymically in organs, such as the pancreas and kidney<sup>3,59</sup>. These studies were initiated by the discovery that pancreatic and renal antigens can be constitutively cross-presented in draining lymph nodes by a bone marrow-derived APC<sup>45</sup>, most probably a DC<sup>33</sup>. Such cross-presentation induced proliferation of naive CD8 T cells, but ultimately led to their deletion<sup>3</sup> (FIG. 4). In related studies, helper T cells were shown to be tolerized by MHC class II-restricted presentation of tissue-derived antigens<sup>59,60</sup>. Although in this case it is not strictly cross-presentation, since antigens enter the conventional MHC class II pathway, the tolerance process is most probably mediated by the same DCs through the same tolerogenic signals.

Antigen expression levels significantly determine whether self-antigens are cross-presented in sufficient amounts to cause CTL deletion<sup>53</sup>. So, antigen dose strictly determines the state of tolerance to self, with high-dose antigens inducing deletional tolerance by cross-presentation, and low-dose antigens being ignored. Even when sufficient antigen is expressed to cause cross-presentation, the rate of deletion might be affected by dose. Sherman and colleagues<sup>54</sup> reported the more rapid deletion of haemagglutinin-specific CTL in homozygous compared with heterozygous transgenic mice, due to increased expression of haemagglutinin in the pancreas. Interestingly, they showed the deletional process to be rather slow, with deletion of 10<sup>3</sup> adoptively transferred CTLs requiring 2–4 weeks. This rate would, however, be more than adequate for dealing with the few self-reactive CTLs expected to be generated in a normal repertoire.

In addition to antigen dose, the site of expression and age of the host influence cross-presentation of self-antigens<sup>61</sup>, and hence cross-tolerance<sup>62</sup>. This understanding began with the observation that presentation of an islet antigen in non-obese diabetic mice did not begin until about the third week of life<sup>61</sup>. Similarly, both OVA<sup>61</sup> and haemagglutinin<sup>62</sup>, transgenically expressed in the islet β-cells, failed to be cross-presented until this time. This did not seem to be due to a lack of antigen expression<sup>62</sup>, supporting the idea that cross-presentation

**Figure 4 | Cross-presentation of self-antigens leads to induction of CTL tolerance to peripheral tissues.** Dendritic cells (DCs) capture antigen from peripheral tissues, such as pancreatic β-cells, and then cross-present them to autoreactive cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in the draining lymph node. This leads to proliferation followed by deletion of the autoreactive CTL, resulting in tolerance to the self-antigens. At present, it is unclear whether the DC captures antigen directly from the tissue cells or simply resides in the draining lymph node where it captures shed antigens.

nodes. They have yet to examine antigen presentation, but their studies formally show that DCs can capture and transport apoptotic cells *in vivo*. In our own studies<sup>47</sup>, pancreatic islets that transgenically express low amounts of OVA failed to supply antigen for cross-presentation in the draining lymph node, unless they were first exposed to activated CTLs that destroyed islet tissue. Therefore, killing islet cells enhanced cross-presentation. Whether this was due to the generation of apoptotic cells or simply due to the release of antigen has yet to be resolved<sup>52</sup>.

Despite the evidence that cellular destruction can facilitate cross-presentation, there are situations in which neither apoptosis nor necrosis seem necessary. For example, several lines of transgenic mice express antigens in the pancreatic islets that are cross-presented in the draining lymph nodes in the apparent absence of apoptosis<sup>47,53,54</sup>. So, how can cross-presentation occur without cellular destruction? One simple possibility is that antigens are secreted and then captured in the draining nodes by DCs that are capable of cross-presentation. However, careful analysis of the response to soluble versus cell-associated OVA has led us to conclude that even when islets express secreted OVA, cross-presentation requires that the antigen is captured in a cell-associated form, perhaps directly from the islet cells<sup>55</sup>. Support for a mechanism in which DCs can directly capture cellular antigens from live cells comes from a recently described process we refer to as ‘nibbling’<sup>56</sup>. In these studies, DCs were cultured with various other cell types labelled with dyes. In all cases, material was captured by unlabelled DCs through the nibbling of small vesicles from the donor cells. An example of this transfer is shown in FIG. 3. This was found to be DC-specific,

of pancreatic antigens is suppressed during the juvenile period. However, this is not a general phenomenon for all tissues since OVA expressed in the kidney was cross-presented at the earliest time examined (day 10) (REF.61). An important consequence of the late onset of cross-presentation of pancreatic antigens is that there is no deletion of islet-specific CTLs in young mice. In mice expressing haemagglutinin as a transgenic antigen in the pancreatic islets, for example, infection of juvenile mice with influenza virus induced haemagglutinin-specific CTLs that caused autoimmune diabetes<sup>62</sup>. This was not the case for adult mice, which had deleted their haemagglutin-specific CTLs by cross-presentation and were resistant to diabetes induction by influenza virus infection. These observations raise the important question of whether juvenile diabetes in humans is associated with a similar failure to cross-present islet antigens during our early years of life. These data indicate that cross-presentation of tissue antigens, and hence cross-tolerance, can be regulated both temporally and regionally. How this regulation occurs must now be addressed.

Overall, several studies clearly show that cross-presentation can lead to peripheral self-tolerance<sup>3,54,59,60,62</sup>. The important unanswered questions are: (i) how are T cells tolerized, (ii) what is the DC subset responsible for this tolerance induction and, most importantly, (iii) does this form of tolerance have a significant role in the natural maintenance of self-tolerance? With respect to the last question, most studies have used transgenically expressed antigens to monitor peripheral tolerance, and it will be important to verify the role of cross-presentation in self-tolerance to natural antigens.

### Role of cross-presentation in viral immunity

Cross-presentation was first discovered because of its role in generating CTL immunity (cross-priming) to minor histocompatibility antigens expressed by transplanted ALLOGENEIC cells<sup>19</sup>. Other cell-associated antigens, including those expressed by tumours<sup>22</sup> and viruses<sup>46</sup>, have been reported to cross-prime. However, there are few studies that unequivocally show cross-priming to be vital for natural, protective, CTL immunity. This does not mean that cross-priming has no role in natural immunity, only that it remains difficult to discriminate between the role of cross-presentation and direct presentation in natural CTL priming. In this review, we have focused on the role of cross-priming in viral immunity, although there is good evidence that this mechanism also participates in tumour immunosurveillance (BOX 1).

Over the years, it has been shown that many viral antigens can be cross-presented<sup>22,43,44,62–64</sup>, although in these cases viral proteins were not expressed during virus infections but by transformed or transfected cells, or within transgenic mice. Virus-specific CTL immunity has been shown to depend on bone marrow-derived cells (presumably DCs) for several infections, including influenza virus<sup>65</sup>, *vaccinia virus*<sup>46,66</sup>, poliovirus<sup>46</sup> and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus<sup>65</sup>, consistent with a role for cross-priming in viral immunity. In these cases, however, it is difficult to exclude direct presentation by virus-infected DCs.

Irrespective of their preferred cell tropism for productive replication, many viruses have a broader range of infectivity, in which even partial or abortive infections can give rise to perfectly good CTL determinants. Consequently, active measures are required to unambiguously exclude the possibility of direct presentation, even when a virus is not formally known to infect DCs. In one attempt to exclude direct presentation, Norbury and colleagues<sup>67</sup> used a combination of chemical and UV treatment to confine infection to an introduced non-haemopoietic cell line, and thus demonstrate virus-specific CTL cross-priming. Probably the most convincing evidence that cross-priming is sufficient to prime CTL immunity during virus infection, however, comes from Rock and colleagues<sup>46</sup>. They provided direct evidence for CTL cross-priming to poliovirus in a murine model, in which direct infection of DCs was made impossible. Mice are not a natural host of poliovirus as they lack the receptor found on human cells necessary for virus infection. But by transgenically expressing this receptor on only the non-bone marrow-derived compartment, Sigal and co-workers<sup>46</sup> were able to ensure that bone marrow-derived APCs could not be infected. The demonstration that CTL immunity required antigen presentation by a bone marrow-derived cell, despite the inability of poliovirus to infect such cells, implicated cross-priming in the induction of CTL immunity to this virus. Although this example directly shows that virus immunity can be mediated by cross-priming, it does not address the contribution of cross-priming versus direct priming when both pathways are available. Therefore, it remains a formal possibility that cross-priming was observed only because other pathways were inaccessible.

Overall, these studies illustrate that cross-priming is observed extensively in experimental systems, supporting the idea that this process exists and is likely to be important for natural infections. One can envisage

**Box 1 | Cross-priming and immunity to tumours**

For generating cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) immunity to tumours there are really only two possibilities: either the CTL are primed by direct recognition of antigen on the tumour cells, or else the tumour antigens are cross-presented on host dendritic cells. At present, there is a growing body of evidence that indicates cross-priming can induce immunity to tumours<sup>22,41,44,63,64,76,77</sup>, and an equally convincing set of data showing it cannot<sup>19,78,79</sup>. In some cases, in which cross-priming is absent, CTL immunity might be generated by allowing access of the tumour to the secondary lymphoid compartment for direct encounter with naive T cells<sup>78,79</sup>. Whether cross-priming is involved in the natural immunosurveillance of spontaneous tumours remains unresolved. Certainly, some tumours are induced by viruses, raising the possibility that, at least in these cases, virus-specific cross-priming could limit tumorigenesis. However, it is difficult to assess the significance of cross-priming in natural tumour immunity, since detectable tumours must have escaped immunosurveillance to arise. So, although failure of some tumours to cross-prime could be taken as evidence that cross-priming is not involved in natural tumour immunity, it could equally well mean that tumours only arise if they subvert cross-priming. At present, we cannot distinguish between these two alternatives.

Figure 5 | Viral subversion of dendritic cell function: cross-priming is required to generate CTL immunity. Some viruses impair dendritic cell (DC) function during infection, for example by inhibition of MHC class I-restricted presentation or blocking migration of DCs. In these circumstances, viral inhibition of infected DCs prevents cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) stimulation by the direct MHC class I pathway. However, cross-presentation of antigens that are derived from infected cells by uninfected DCs is likely to result in CTL immunity in the face of inhibitory mechanisms. Although virus-mediated inhibition of target-cell expression of MHC class I will also impair the effector phase of responses induced by cross-priming, this is unlikely to completely block recognition by effector CTLs.

that cross-priming would have an important role in cases in which a virus infection is truly localized to a peripheral non-lymphoid compartment, such as for papilloma virus, in which the infection is confined to the epithelial cells of the skin⁶⁸. In addition, cross-priming could be important in instances where viruses have evolved mechanisms that specifically inhibit conventional MHC class I-restricted antigen processing and presentation⁶⁹⁻⁷⁵. In these situations, cross-presentation would result in successful CTL priming in the face of inhibitory mechanisms that would otherwise prevent direct presentation by infected DCs. In addition to the specific targeting of antigen presentation, there are emerging examples of viruses that inhibit various aspects of DC function. Recently, several viruses, including *herpes simplex virus*¹¹, *measles virus*¹²,¹³, retrovirus¹⁴, canarypox virus¹⁵, vaccinia virus¹⁶ and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus¹⁷, have all been shown to have detrimental effects on DCs. Given that professional APCs, such as DCs, are essential for priming viral responses, but that some of these same viruses (for example, vaccinia virus) can ‘deactivate’ DCs during infection, the logical conclusion is that immunity is induced by cross-priming (FIG. 5). By cross-presenting viral antigens, there is no requirement for DCs to be infected (and exposed to the associated hazards) in order to prime naive CTLs to MHC class I-restricted viral antigens. It therefore seems that two different reasons could justify the maintenance of cross-priming by the immune system: first, as suggested by Bevan¹⁸, it might be very important for generating CTL immunity to tissue-specific viruses that do not infect DCs; and additionally, it might be vital for generating immunity to viruses that infect DCs, but then inhibit their function.

The current verdict on cross-presentation

Over the past decade, a number of significant steps have been taken towards understanding cross-presentation and its consequences — cross-priming and cross-tolerance. Building on the earlier efforts of Bevan and many others, Pardoll and co-workers clearly showed a role for cross-priming in immunity to experimental tumours, whereas Rock’s lab generated the first convincing evidence for virus-specific cross-priming. Extending the studies of von Boehmer’s lab on thymic cross-tolerance, several groups provided strong evidence that peripheral tissue antigens could be cross-presented in the draining lymph nodes for induction of peripheral self-tolerance. In addition, important observations have been made about the nature of antigenic material targeted for cross-presentation, including evidence that cross-presentation can be targeted by heat-shock proteins, apoptotic and necrotic cells, exosomes or even immune complexes. Finally, with the advent of methods for the purification of DC subsets, largely pioneered by Shortman and colleagues, Bevan’s lab was again able to make a significant impact in the field of cross-priming 25 years after his original discovery, by reporting that it is primarily the CD8⁺ DC subset that is responsible for this process. Despite all this new and exciting information, our understanding of cross-presentation is still only in its infancy. Our new knowledge of which DC subsets are responsible for this process will help us enormously in future efforts to gain a detailed understanding of the mechanism of cross-presentation. Finally, it will be the design of experimental models that can address the nature of tolerance to natural self-antigens, and the contribution of direct versus cross-presentation to immunity, that will be important if we are to define the extent to which we depend on cross-presentation for immunity and tolerance.

William R. Heath received his Ph.D. from the University of Melbourne in 1988 and then spent several years at Scripps Research Foundation in La Jolla before moving to the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute in 1990. Since then, his studies, in collaboration with Dr Carbone, have focused on understanding the mechanisms of peripheral tolerance, particularly with respect to cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). This led to the observation that tissue antigens are cross-presented and induce deletional tolerance. He has also been responsible for dissecting the requirements for cross-priming, providing the first evidence that CD40 licensing of dendritic cells is important for their capacity to prime CTL.

Francis R. Carbone received his Ph.D. from the University of Melbourne in 1985. He spent a postdoctoral period in the US at Scripps Research Foundation where, in Dr Michael Bevan’s lab, he described the cytosolic class I processing pathway and the capacity of exogenous protein antigens to cross-prime *in vivo*. He returned to Australia in 1990 and is currently an Associate Professor at the Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Melbourne. Dr Carbone has a long-standing interest in cross-presentation and is currently applying this to the study of herpes simplex virus infection.

**At a glance summary**

T lymphocytes can be separated into two subpopulations, based on their expression of CD4 and CD8. The CD4+ subset is primarily responsible for providing help to other immune cells, whereas CD8+ T cells are best known for their capacity to kill virus-infected cells.

Cross-presentation is defined as the processing of exogenous antigens into the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I pathway. Cross-priming and cross-tolerance refer to the induction of cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) immunity or tolerance, respectively, that is induced by cross-presented antigens.

Despite the discovery of cross-priming in the mid-1970s, the antigen-presenting cell responsible for this process has only recently been identified. Bevan and coworkers provided evidence that it is the CD8+ dendritic cell (DC).

Although there are several pathways for cross-presentation, our current understanding of which pathway(s) operate *in vivo* for cross-presentation of cell-associated antigens that are derived from virus-infected cells or self tissues is minimal.

As well as providing a mechanism for generating immunity to intracellular infections, cross-presentation has been reported to participate in tolerance induction. Such cross-tolerance is most probably mediated by DCs and leads to the deletion of self-reactive CTLs.

Antigen expression levels, the site of expression, the time of expression and the availability of help, crucially determine whether self-antigens cause cross-tolerance.

There are few studies that unequivocally show cross-priming to be crucial for natural, protective, CTL immunity. This does not mean that cross-priming has

no role in natural immunity, only that it remains difficult to discriminate between the role of cross-presentation and direct presentation in natural CTL priming.

Virus-specific CTL immunity has been shown to depend on bone marrow-derived cells (presumably DCs) for several infections, including influenza virus, vaccinia virus, poliovirus and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, consistent with a role for cross-priming in viral immunity.

One can envisage that cross-priming has an important role in cases where a virus infection is localized to a peripheral non-lymphoid compartment, such as for papilloma virus infection of the epithelial cells of the skin. In addition, cross-priming could be important where viruses have evolved mechanisms that specifically disrupt the immune functions of DCs.
