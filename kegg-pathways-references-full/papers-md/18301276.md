#### Purpose of review

Recent identification and characterization of novel Mg²⁺ transporters have clarified our understanding of intestinal magnesium absorption. The predominant Mg²⁺ transporters include TRPM6 and TRPM7, members of the transient receptor potential melastatin family of cation channels. Mutations of TRPM6 result in a primary disorder termed hypomagnesemia with secondary hypocalcemia.

#### Recent findings

Both TRPM6 and TRPM7 channels possess an atypical α-kinase domain. Recent studies have shown that TRPM7 channel activity is regulated by intracellular Mg²⁺ and magnesium-nucleotides and modulated via this phosphotransferase kinase. TRPM6 channel function and intestinal magnesium absorption is altered by a variety of hormones and factors. Although it is apparent that TRPM6 and TRPM7 form heteromeric ion channels, controversy surrounds the nature of this interaction. Some studies show that TRPM6 may function on its own whereas other research concludes that TRPM7 is required for effective trafficking of TRPM6 to the plasma membrane. Finally, a number of other Mg²⁺ transporters have been identified in intestinal epithelial cells but the role of these proteins is unclear.

#### Summary

The recent developments in intestinal magnesium absorption and cellular magnesium homeostasis provide a basis for understanding magnesium deficiency disorders and provide a platform for future investigations.

#### Keywords

channel kinases, hypomagnesemia, magnesium, TRPM6, TRPM7

### Introduction

The magnesium ion is the second most abundant cation in the cell and plays an important role in many intra-cellular biochemical functions. Deficiency of this essential metal ion has been implicated in many diseases ranging from hypertension, migraines, and asthma to osteoporosis. The average daily diet in North America contains between approximately 228 mg (adult females) and 323 mg (adult males) of elemental magnesium. The recommended daily estimated average requirement for magnesium is 320 and 420 mg for adult females and males, respectively. About 30–40% of ingested magnesium is normally absorbed by the intestine. Fractional magnesium absorption may increase as high as 80% with dietary deficits and decrease to 20% with magnesium surfeits. Accordingly, intestinal absorption is controlled by factors that respond appropriately to dietary magnesium balance. Magnesium homeostasis is determined by a balance between intestinal absorption of available dietary magnesium and renal excretion of urinary magnesium [1**]. The cellular mechanisms of magnesium absorption in these organs have been greatly clarified over the last few years with the identification of TRPM6 and TRPM7, members of the transient receptor potential melastatin family of cation channels, and genes encoding other epithelial Mg²⁺ transporters.

### Passive paracellular magnesium absorption

There is evidence that intestinal magnesium absorption occurs through paracellular and transcellular pathways [1**]. The majority, about 90%, of normal magnesium absorption occurs passively through the paracellular pathway between the enterocytes (Fig. 1). The rate of magnesium absorption across the intestinal epithelium is dependent on the transepithelial electrical voltage (which is normally about +5 mV, lumen positive with respect to blood) and the transepithelial concentration gradient. The luminal magnesium concentration may be in the order of 1.0–5.0 mM depending on the dietary magnesium content and the presence of anionic chelators. Only the free Mg²⁺ moves through the paracellular pathway so that bound magnesium does not contribute to the transepithelial gradient. Serum Mg²⁺ concentration is

hormonal and nonhormonal factors acting through a variety of intracellular signals. Further studies are required to determine controls of paracellular absorption and the role of the tight-junctional complexes.

### Active transcellular magnesium absorption

Transcellular magnesium absorption is active in nature, mediated by TRPM6 and TRPM7 Mg²⁺ transport proteins, and regulated by a number of hormones and influences. TRPM6 and TRPM7 comprise a subgroup of Mg²⁺ transporters that belong to the transient receptor potential melastatin superfamily of cationic channels [3**–5**]. TRPM proteins possess six predicted transmembrane domains (TMDs). Hydrophobic regions between TMD5 and TMD6 are thought to contribute to the cation pore when four channel subunits coalesce to form the functional transporter [6*]. Unlike other members of the TRPM superfamily, the homologues TRPM6 and TRPM7 form ion channels and possess a C-terminal Thr/Ser kinase that belongs to an atypical family of eukaryotic α-kinases [3**,4**]. Accordingly, these proteins are termed chanzymes.

With respect to channel function, TRPM6 and TRPM7 are permeable to both major divalent cations, Ca²⁺ and Mg²⁺, but also many of the trace elements, such as Zn²⁺, Mn²⁺, and Co²⁺ [3**–5**]. The divalent cations move into the cell down the transmembrane electrochemical gradient (Fig. 2). TRPM6 and TRPM7 are constitutively active cation channels that are suppressed by elevated cytoplasmic free Mg²⁺ and MgATP, suggesting that cytosolic Mg²⁺ is an important regulator of channel function [4**]. The channel properties of TRPM6, such as outward rectifying current-voltage (I-V) curve, intracellular Mg²⁺ regulation, and external Ca²⁺ and Mg²⁺ block, were found to be indistinguishable from those of TRPM7. However, there are biophysical differences between the two channels, including a greater permeability of TRPM6 to Ni²⁺, a differential response of TRPM7 to the inositol trisphosphate (IP₃) inhibitor, 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate, and a larger unitary conductance of TRPM6 relative to TRPM7 [7*–9*].

TRPM7 is ubiquitously expressed among tissues whereas TRPM6 is found along the full length of the intestine, along the kidney nephron (predominantly in distal convoluted tubules) and in lung and testis tissues [3**]. Targeted deletion of TRPM7 in cell lines results in intracellular magnesium depletion and growth arrest [4**]. These data point to an essential role of the ubiquitously expressed TRPM7 for cellular magnesium homeostasis. A mutated variant of TRPM7 has been found in patients with Guamanian amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Parkinsonism dementia [10]. Heterologous expression of the mutated TRPM7 produces functional channels that

Figure 2 Structure of the brush-border TRPM6 Mg²⁺ channel

TRPM6 protein comprises a cation-channel region with six predicted transmembrane domains (TMDs) with a putative pore region between the fifth and sixth TMDs, a long N-terminus characteristic of the transient receptor potential melastatin family of transporters, a transient receptor potential (TRP) domain and finally a C-terminus α-kinase domain. Modified from Schlingmann et al. [3**].

show an increased sensitivity to inhibition by intracellular Mg²⁺ [10]. TRPM6 is important for Mg²⁺ absorption across intestinal and renal epithelial cells because of its location. TRPM6 protein is localized to the apical membrane of the intestine and renal distal convoluted tubule, thus forming the entry pathway into the epithelial cell [3**]. Using a positional cloning approach, Schlingmann et al. [3**] found that the syndrome hypomagnesemia with secondary hypocalcemia (HSH) is caused by mutations in the TRPM6 gene. HSH is an autosomal-recessive disorder characterized by low serum Mg²⁺ levels due to diminished intestinal Mg²⁺ absorption and increased renal Mg²⁺ excretion. TRPM6 mutations identified in HSH patients comprise premature stop mutations, exon deletions, frame shifts and inserted splice sites that lead to aberrant TRPM6 proteins and loss of function. Patients uniformly manifest in early infancy with generalized convulsions, muscle spasms or tetany that are refractory to anticonvulsant treatment. Severe and prolonged hypomagnesemia results in hypoparathyroidism and diminished parathyroid hormone levels that lead to hypocalcemia. As dietary magnesium is absorbed across the intestine by passive paracellular transport even with loss-of-function TRPM6 mutations, the treatment of HSH patients consists of high oral magnesium supplementation.

An interesting facet of TRPM7 and TRPM6 physiology is the ability to form hetero-oligomeric channel complexes. By a variety of approaches, Schlingmann and colleagues [3**] and Chubanov and colleagues [6*] demonstrated that TRPM7 was necessary for TRPM6 trafficking to the plasma membrane. Other TRPM channel members (TRPM1–4) could not heteromerize with the channel kinases and were unable to direct TRPM6 to the membrane [3**]. As TRPM7 is functional on its own, TRPM6 is not needed for TRPM7 trafficking but TRPM7 may need homo-oligomerization for correct positioning to the plasma membrane. In support of these observations, Schmitz et al. [11] showed that TRPM7-deficient cells cannot be complemented by heterologously expressed TRPM6. Additionally they reported that TRPM6 can modulate TRPM7 function by phosphorylation [11]. They conclude that TRPM6 and TRPM7 are not functionally redundant but are both crucial components of magnesium homeostasis. In support of this notion, Li et al. [8*] reported that single-channel conductance and biophysical properties are different in TRPM6–TRPM7 heteromeric complexes compared with the homomeric channels. All of these studies suggest that TRPM6 is not functional without the presence of TRPM7. However, another research group has reported that

TRPM6 is fully functional in heterologous expressed cell lines [5**,7*]. Further studies are needed to clarify this controversy. Although it is controversial whether TRPM6 can function on its own, it is clear from the HSH patients that TRPM7 cannot substitute for TRPM6 in intestinal or renal magnesium absorption [3**].

Another interesting characteristic is that TRPM6 and TRPM7 have α-kinase activity linked to the channel function. The advantages of this close association of the two functions are far from clear. Although it is apparent that deletion of the α-kinase domain does not abrogate transport, it may modulate the dose–response curve to intracellular Mg²⁺ and MgATP so that there is suppression of channel gating at physiological intracellular Mg²⁺ concentrations [12**,13,14]. Scharenberg [14] has hypothesized that because the TRPM7 α-kinase is positioned next to the conducting channel of TRPM7, entry of Mg²⁺ or Ca²⁺ may produce local changes in free divalent cation in sufficient concentrations to activate the associated kinase domain. In Scharenberg's [14] view, activation of the associated α-kinase would then signal various functions via other phosphorylated substrates and/or feedback to modulate TRPM7 channel gating. Thus TRPM7 could function as a 'Mg²⁺ sensor'. However, Matsushita et al. [13] have reported that TRPM7 transport is completely abolished with deletion of the kinase domain. They suggest that the kinase domain may play a role in channel assembly or subcellular localization to the plasma membrane. As reviewed by Scharenberg [14], this difference may depend on the TRPM7 constructs used or the fact that the transfected cells express a background of wild-type TRPM7 proteins. More recently, Demeuse et al. [12**] demonstrated that physiological MgATP concentrations can inhibit TRPM7 channels and strongly enhance the channel-blocking efficacy of free intracellular Mg²⁺. The nucleotide-mediated inhibition was lost in kinase-deficient mutants of TRPM7 while the Mg²⁺-dependent regulation was retained but with reduced efficacy. They concluded that the nucleotide-dependent regulation of TRPM7 is mediated by the nucleotide-binding site on the endogenous kinase domain and interacts synergistically with a Mg²⁺-binding site on the channel extrinsic to the kinase domain [12**]. Finally, Schmitz et al. [11] showed that TRPM6 kinase can phosphorylate TRPM7 but TRPM7 kinase did not phosphorylate TRPM6. They speculate that TRPM6 phosphorylation of TRPM7 might alter its sensitivity to intracellular Mg²⁺ and modulate Mg²⁺ transport.

Other possible functions of the kinase domain include a role in phospholipase signaling. The kinase domain associates with the C2 domain of phospholipase C. Runnels et al. [15] reported that phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP₂) is required for TRPM7 channel activity whereas Takezawa et al. [16] showed that

TRPM7 abolished activation of phospholipase Cβ via muscarinic and thrombin receptors coupled to Gq proteins. They provided evidence that TRPM7 activity is modulated by its own endogenous kinase domain, responding to changes in intracellular levels of cAMP induced by Gi- and Gs-coupled receptors [16]. More recently, Dorovkov and Ryazanov [17] have shown that the TRPM7 α-kinase phosphorylates and activates annexin 1. Although it is known that annexin 1 interacts with many proteins and membranes to play a pleiotropic role in cytoskeletal dynamics, cell proliferation, and ion channel trafficking, the functional significance of annexin 1 phosphorylation by TRPM7 is not clearly understood. Clark et al. [18*] demonstrated that activation of TRPM7 by bradykinin leads to a Ca²⁺- and kinase-dependent interaction with the actinomycin cytoskeleton. Su et al. [19*] reported that TRPM7 regulates local Ca²⁺ concentrations within peripheral adhesion complexes to activate m-calpain and initiate the disassembly or turnover of peripheral adhesion complexes. They suggest that TRPM7-dependent regulation of m-calpain may be important in cell adhesion, motility, metastasis, apoptosis, and ischemic cell death. In support of this notion, Aarts et al. [20] have reported that TRPM7 may accelerate the anoxic-induced production of reactive oxygen species through mediation of Ca²⁺ influx following neural injury, thereby exacerbating cell death. It is evident from these reports that TRPM7, through its kinase activity, might provide a cationic sensor-signaling link to many diverse functions. It is not known whether these observations with TRPM7 apply to TRPM6 kinase.

There is a growing list of hormones and other factors that have been reported to influence TRPM6 and TRPM7 protein expression and in some cases TRPM6-/TRPM7-mediated Mg²⁺ transport. Angiotensin II [20], aldosterone [21*], bradykinin [21*], thrombin [16], estrogen [22*], metabolic acidosis/alkalosis [23], distal thiazide diuretics [24], immunosuppressant tacrolimus [5**], chemically induced diabetes mellitus [25], mechano- or osmo-regulation [26,27] and cholera [28] have all been implicated in control of TRPM7 and/or TRPM6 in a variety of cells. These changes may be mediated by covalent means such as phospholipase C-coupled receptors [21*] or through controls at either the transcript or protein levels [5**,22*,24,29]. Interestingly, parathyroid hormone or 1,25-hydroxy-vitamin D had no effect on TRPM6 expression [22*]. Finally, Groenestege et al. [22*] reported that dietary magnesium restriction and hypomagnesemia leads to increased TRPM6 mRNA in the kidney but renal TRPM7 was not changed. Conversely, dietary magnesium surfeit results in increased TRPM6 expression in the intestine [22*]. These observations clearly show that TRPM6 and TRPM7 channel activity is influenced by numerous hormones and factors at different regulatory levels.

In summary, the TRPM7 and TRPM6 channel-kinase proteins play a wide range of functions in cellular divalent cation metabolism. TRPM7 appears to have a greater multifunctional role as it is expressed ubiquitously, mediates both Mg²⁺ and Ca²⁺ entry, and is involved in a number of functions related to the maintenance of cation balance, membrane adhesion, and cell growth. TRPM6 is limited in distribution and by all accounts is principally involved with epithelial Mg²⁺ transport in the intestine and kidney. Despite this diversification, they have retained some of the same channel and enzyme properties.

### Other mammalian Mg²⁺ transporters

There are a number of other Mg²⁺ transporters, likely channels, that have recently been identified in mammalian tissues. Schindl and colleagues [30] have demonstrated that the mitochondrial RNA splicing 2 (Mrs2) gene encodes a protein that effects Mg²⁺ flux across the inner mitochondrial membranes. Mrs2 is a member of a large family of yeast and plant genes. Mrs2 mediates high-capacity Mg²⁺ influx in isolated yeast mitochondria driven by the inner membrane potential. We have recently identified a number of novel Mg²⁺ transporters using microarray analysis to determine differentially expressed genes responsive to magnesium. The first family identified was termed MagT [31]. The MagT family comprises a novel magnesium transporter (MagT1) and a candidate tumour suppressor, N33. MagT1 is highly selective for Mg²⁺ whereas N33 transports other divalent cations. The second family comprised the human solute carrier, SLC41A1–4 [32]. SLC41 members have a 20% similarity to the prokaryote MgtE protein that mediates Mg²⁺ uptake into bacteria. The third family identified was ACDP1–3 (ACDP stands for ancient conserved domain proteins) [33]. ACDP1 was originally identified as the basis for the urofacial syndrome (UFS) [33]. The urinary abnormality is an obstructive uropathy in which failure of nerve signals between the bladder and the spinal cord results in incomplete emptying of the bladder (neurogenic bladder) and its complications. The *Acdp* genes are highly conserved with homology to that of the microbial CorC protein which is involved with bacterial Co²⁺ resistance and Mg²⁺ transport [34]. We have demonstrated that ACDP proteins mediate Mg²⁺ transport and are regulated by magnesium [34]. Again using microarray analysis, we have identified a novel family of transporters that we have termed MMgT [35]. It comprises two members and is interesting in that the proteins comprise only two predicted TMDs. More recently, we have shown that the NIPA family of genes encode Mg²⁺ transport proteins. NIPA2 is very selective for Mg²⁺ whereas NIPA1, NIPA3 and NIPA4 also mediate several other divalent metals such as Fe²⁺, Cu²⁺ and Co²⁺ [36]. NIPA is localized to the early recycling endosomes and plasma membrane. Mutations in *NIPA1* have been implicated in a distinct

disorder termed autosomal dominant hereditary spastic paraplegia, which comprises more than 30 genetic disorders whose predominant feature is a spastic gait [37]. The role that these various Mg²⁺ transporters play in magnesium homeostasis is poorly understood, but most are present in intestinal epithelial cells.

### Conclusion

Magnesium deficiency remains an important, albeit uncommon clinical problem. Clinical and experimental studies continue to reveal new insights into the fundamental roles of magnesium in cellular metabolism. The identification and characterization of rather unusual proteins combining channel function and kinase activity offer a unique opportunity to design therapeutic strategies and define long- and short-term goals of therapy in magnesium deficiency disorders.
