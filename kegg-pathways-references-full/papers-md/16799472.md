**The many paths to p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase activation in the immune system**

**Jonathan D. Ashwell**

Abstract | Signals emanating from many cell-surface receptors and environmental cues converge on mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), which in turn phosphorylate and activate various transcription factors and other molecular effectors. Members of the p38 MAPK family, which respond to pro-inflammatory cytokines and cellular stresses, are typically activated by serial phosphorylation and activation of upstream kinases (the MAPK cascade). In this Review, I highlight the recent studies that indicate that p38-subfamily members can also be activated by non-canonical mechanisms, at least one of which seems to have an important role in antigen-receptor-activated T cells. These alternative pathways might have particular relevance for cells that participate in immune and inflammatory responses.

**The multistep propagation of discrete intracellular signals allows cells to respond to cues from the extracellular environment. Among the most ubiquitous and well-studied of these intracellular signalling pathways are the phosphorylation cascades that culminate in the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). MAPKs comprise four subfamilies that have activation cascades which use distinct upstream kinases; these are the extracellular-signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), ERK5 (also known as BMK1 and MAPK7), JUN N-terminal kinases (JNKs) and p38 kinases. The MAPKs themselves are usually thought of as serine/threonine kinases, but in some cases they transfer phosphates to tyrosine residues, especially when they themselves are the target of phosphorylation (autophosphorylation)^1^. MAPK substrates are legion and include transcription factors such as activating transcription factor 2 (ATF2), ELK1, FOS, JUN, myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2), MYC and other protein kinases, such as MAPK-activated protein kinases (MAPKAPKs)^2^. Therefore, it should come as no surprise that MAPKs are crucial for a wide range of basic biological processes, including control of the cell cycle, cell differentiation and apoptosis. In this Review, I focus on new insights into how p38-MAPK-family members are activated, with an emphasis on their role in T cells and other mediators of the inflammatory response.**

**The classical MAPK signalling cascade**  
The enzymatic activity of MAPKs is highly influenced by extracellular events. In general, ERK activity is induced by growth-promoting mitogenic stimuli. By contrast, JNK and p38 activities are mainly induced by environmental stress (such as osmotic shock, hypoxia, heat shock and ultraviolet radiation) and, of particular interest to immunologists, by pro-inflammatory stimuli and cytokines, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), interleukin-1 (IL-1), transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) and tumour-necrosis factor (TNF)^3–6^. The nomenclature for the many kinases that participate in the signalling cascade that result in MAPK activation is complex, but can be simplified by applying a few simple principles. The first enzyme that is activated in the classical MAPK cascade (that is, the most membrane-proximal enzyme) is a serine/threonine kinase known as a MAPK kinase kinase (MAPKKK). Each MAPK family has a different set of initiating MAPKKKs. The proximal substrates for MAPKKKs are MAPK kinases (MAPKKs, also known as MKKs), which are activated by MAPKKK-mediated phosphorylation. MAPKKs are dual-specificity kinases that phosphorylate their MAPK substrates on a conserved Thr-X-Tyr motif (where the amino acid denoted X is the same for members of a given MAPK family) in the ‘activation loop’^7–9^. This activation loop is so-named because its phosphorylation results in conformational changes that alter the alignment of the

hemispheric halves of the folded protein and enhance access to substrate, which together increase enzymatic activity^{7-9}. The MAPKs have a substrate preference, but not an absolute requirement, for sites containing a serine or threonine followed by a proline residue^{10}.

**The p38 MAPK family**

p38α was initially identified as a 38 kDa protein that was phosphorylated on tyrosine residues in macrophages stimulated with LPS; subsequently it and its *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* homologue, Hog1, were found to be responsive to environmental stress^{11} (FIG. 1). There are four p38 isoforms, each encoded by a separate gene (TABLE 1). p38α and p38β are 74% identical at the amino-acid level and are widely expressed^{12}. They have in common *in vitro* substrates such as myelin basic protein (MBP), ATF2 and MAPKAPK2, but differ with regard to activity (for example, *in vitro*, p38β is much more active than p38α in phosphorylation of ATF2). Expression of p38γ, which has 63% amino-acid identity with p38α, is largely restricted to skeletal muscle^{13}. Unlike p38α and p38β, p38γ can phosphorylate MBP but not ATF2 or MAPKAPK2 (REF. 13). p38δ has 61% amino-acid identity with p38α and is mainly found in the testes, pancreas and small intestine, as well as in CD4⁺ T cells; it robustly phosphorylates MBP and ATF2 but not MAPKAPK2 (REFS 14, 15). Therefore,

Figure 1 | The MAPK cascade leading to activation of p38-family members. External stimuli initiate GTPase-dependent activation of several mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinases (MAPKKKs) that are upstream of p38, among the best characterized being MAPKKK4 (also known as MTK1 in humans), apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) and TGFβ-activated protein kinase 1 (TAK1) (reviewed in REF. 2). These serine/threonine kinases phosphorylate and activate the dual-specificity kinases MAPKK3 (MKK3), MKK4 and MKK6, which in turn phosphorylate p38 on Thr180 and Tyr182. Phosphorylation of these residues displaces the p38 activation loop, increasing kinase activity and enhancing access to substrate. Among the main consequences of p38 activation is increased expression of mRNAs (because of their stabilization or increased rate of transcription) that encode cytokines and receptors involved in inflammation and immunity. CDC42, cell-division cycle 42; IL-1, interleukin-1; TGFβ, transforming growth factor-β; T_H, T helper; TNF, tumour-necrosis factor.

despite their high overall degree of homology and the same preference for phosphorylating serines and/or threonines that precede prolines, at least *in vitro* the various subfamily members have different fine specificities for substrates. p38 activation can be terminated by the action of dual-specificity phosphatases, such as MAPK phosphatase 1 (REF. 16), by a negative feedback loop that involves the single-specificity (serine) phosphatase WIP1 activated through a p38–p53-dependent pathway^{17} or by other less well-defined regulatory feedback mechanisms^{18}. Differences in substrate specificity and tissue distribution, along with the multiple means to terminate signalling, could lead one to expect that the regulation of activity of p38-family members *in vivo* might differ and, as discussed later, this has proved to be the case.

Various pharmacological and genetic approaches have implicated p38α and p38β in immune and inflammatory processes. SB203580 is a widely used pyridinyl imidazole compound that specifically inhibits p38α and p38β^{14}. SB203580 potently inhibits the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1 and TNF by macrophages and other cells *in vitro* and *in vivo*, and administration of SB203580 has beneficial effects in animal disease models such as collagen-induced arthritis and endotoxin-induced septic shock^{19}. SB203580 also inhibits cytokine production and proliferation that has been induced by mitogen stimulation or T-cell receptor (TCR) ligation, with or without CD28-mediated co-stimulation^{20-22}. p38 can upregulate cytokine production by several independent mechanisms, including direct phosphorylation of transcription factors^2, and direct or indirect (through downstream kinases such as MAPKAPK2) stabilization and increased translation of mRNAs containing 3′ untranslated region adenylate/uridylyte-rich elements (AREs) by phosphorylation of ARE-binding proteins^{23-25}. These observations have kindled interest in p38 as a molecular target in the treatment of inflammatory human diseases. Studies in healthy volunteers given p38α/p38β inhibitors found reductions in pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion from *ex vivo* LPS-stimulated peripheral-blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)^{26}, and decreased LPS-induced pro-inflammatory cytokine production, neutrophil and endothelial-cell activation *in vivo* as well as reduced clinical symptoms (such as headaches and chills)^{27-29}. These observations identify p38α and p38β as principal mediators of the inflammatory response to endotoxin. Several Phase II–III clinical trials are underway to evaluate selective inhibitors of either p38α alone or both p38α and p38β, in particular for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis^{30-32}.

Genetic evidence that supports important functions for p38 comes from knockout and transgenic studies of p38 and its upstream activators. Expression of dominant-negative p38α in T cells resulted in impaired interferon-γ (IFNγ) production by cells cultured in T helper 1 (T_H1)-inducing conditions^{20}. Mice lacking both MKK3 and MKK6, the two main p38-specific MAPKKs, are not viable, dying in midgestation with defects in the placenta and the embryonic vasculature^{33}. This observation

indicates that MKK3 and MKK6 serve at least some redundant roles, because loss of either gene alone yields healthy mice^{34–36}. TNF-induced p38 activation was completely abolished in *Mkk3⁻/⁻Mkk6⁻/⁻* (double-deficient) fibroblasts, which also exhibited impaired growth arrest following serum starvation and greater tumorigenic potential when transformed. This increased tumorigenicity might reflect the tumour-suppressing activity of p38, which might result from its negative effects on the cell cycle and its ability to activate p53 and possibly other tumour suppressors^{37,38}. With regard to the single *Mkk*-knockout mice, TNF-induced p38 activity and cytokine production were defective in MKK3-deficient fibroblasts, and macrophages and dendritic cells from these animals produced little IL-12 and had impaired generation of *T_H*1 cells. MKK6-deficient but not MKK3-deficient double-positive (*CD4⁺CD8⁺*) thymocytes were resistant to TCR-mediated apoptosis, especially when TCR-specific antibody was injected *in vivo*. This might actually reflect reduced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by MKK6-deficient peripheral T cells, as the main mechanism for double-positive thymocyte deletion in this model system involves T-cell-derived, cytokine-induced glucocorticoid production by the adrenal glands^{39}. Nonetheless, negative selection of MKK6-deficient thymocytes is defective, as demonstrated by reduced apoptosis in antigen-specific TCR-transgenic models of negative selection^{40}. The relative roles for these MAPKKs in p38 activation was reversed in peripheral T cells, in which MKK3-deficient, but not MKK6-deficient, *CD4⁺* T cells were resistant to activation-induced or IL-2-withdrawal-induced apoptosis. Studies in which a constitutively active form of MKK6 was expressed implicated p38 in early thymocyte development, IFNγ production by *T_H*1 cells and *CD8⁺* T cells, and *CD8⁺* T-cell apoptosis^{41,42}. So, the combined results of both pharmacological and genetic manipulations provide evidence that p38 is a crucial mediator of many important biological and immunological processes. This MAPK family has a dual role in inflammation, being a signalling intermediate downstream of pro-inflammatory cytokine receptors, such as those for IL-1 and TNF, and in some circumstances, being required for the production of these same pro-inflammatory cytokines^{43}.

Despite the extensive indirect evidence implicating p38 in T-cell development, activation and inflammation, studies of animals in which p38 isoforms have been directly targeted have generally yielded few abnormalities. Such approaches have found that p38α is the only isoform that clearly has crucial non-redundant functions *in vivo*^{44}. Knockout of the gene encoding p38α results in midgestational lethality owing to defects in angiogenesis, placental insufficiency and anaemia. The anaemia is caused by a decrease in the stability of erythropoietin mRNA transcripts with a resultant reduction in erythropoietin levels. These observations are consistent with a role for p38α in the adaptive response to hypoxia. Notably, when the placental defect was circumvented by tetraploid rescue, p38α-deficient animals developed to term and seemed to be normal^{45}. The function of p38α in T and B cells has been addressed using the recombination-activating gene (RAG)-deficient blastocyst complementation method^{46}. Perhaps surprisingly, given the many functions mediated by p38, p38α-deficient T and B cells developed in normal numbers and proliferated normally in response to various stimuli, including antigen-receptor ligation. Animals generated with knockout mutations of the other p38-family members have shown even more disappointing phenotypes. Animals lacking p38β seem to be completely normal, with no obvious defects in T-cell development or LPS-induced cytokine production^{47}. Likewise, although not yet fully characterized, mice lacking p38γ, p38δ or both have been reported to be viable, fertile and have no obvious health problems^{48}. It might take considerably more detailed analyses of specific biological pathways, and perhaps the characterization of combinations of p38-subfamily-knockout animals, to reconcile the genetic and pharmacological data with the paucity of observable abnormalities in p38-isoform-specific knockouts.

The autophosphorylation clue

The classical MAPK cascade can account for p38 activation under most circumstances. The finding that mouse embryonic fibroblasts deficient in both MKK3 and MKK6, or deficient in MKK3, **MKK4** and MKK6 do not activate p38 in response to TNF or ultraviolet radiation, respectively, certainly demonstrates the importance of the MAPK cascade in p38 activation^{36}. Yet the classical cascade cannot explain all p38 activation. The classical model proposes that p38 is phosphorylated on both threonine and tyrosine (that is, dual phosphorylation in the Thr-Gly-Tyr motif) and activated by upstream MAPKKs. In this case, inhibition of p38 activity itself should have no effect on p38 dual phosphorylation; however, the observation has been repeatedly made with different cell types and in different laboratories that this is not the case. For example, SB203580 inhibits dual phosphorylation of p38α/p38β in various cell lines and tissues in response to physiological stimuli (such as LPS, CpG-containing oligodeoxynucleotides, vitamin C and TNF) and stressful stimuli (such as cadmium, auranofin, ischaemia, phytosphingosine and reactive oxygen species)^{49–57}. It might be possible to explain some of this by postulating that SB203580 also targets regulators of p38 phosphorylation, which are either phosphatases or upstream kinases. There is another possibility, however. It could be that

Tetraploid rescue  
A complementation technique for producing a normal placenta that supports the development of mutant embryos. Briefly, two-cell embryos are fused to create tetraploid cells, which can contribute to all extraembryonic tissues but not to the embryo itself. The tetraploid cells are aggregated with diploid embryonic stem cells or early embryos and implanted into pseudopregnant recipients.

RAG-deficient blastocyst complementation method  
A gene-targeting technique used for the genetic analysis of lymphocytes. Complementation of recombination-activating gene 2 (RAG2)-deficient blastocysts (which cannot produce mature T or B cells) with embryonic stem cells that have a mutation in the gene of interest creates chimaeras that have genetically altered T and B cells.
under some circumstances, p38 can autophosphorylate the threonine and/or tyrosine residues in its own activation loop and so activate itself in a feed-forward manner. It has long been known that, as with other MAPKs, p38 can autophosphorylate *in vitro* to a limited extent⁵⁸. The degree of autophosphorylation is influenced by the length of the p38 loop containing the Thr-Gly-Tyr phosphorylation motif and the identity of the non-phosphorylated intervening residue (for example, autophosphorylation is more likely to occur if there is an intervening aspartic acid residue rather than a glycine residue)⁵⁸. Indeed, it is now appreciated that p38 autophosphorylation does occur in physiological settings, and, as discussed here, mounting evidence indicates that this has key roles in immunologically relevant processes.

### TAB1 and p38 activation

Using a yeast two-hybrid screening protocol for proteins that interact with the MAPKKK TGFβ-activated protein kinase 1 (TAK1), **TAB1** (TAK1-binding protein 1) and **TAB2** were identified⁵⁹. TAB1 has been implicated as a regulator of signalling that acts through various cytokine receptors by activating TAK1. Although recent studies with knockout mice cast doubts that these molecules have an essential role in TAK1 signalling⁶⁰, it is noteworthy that TAB1 was independently identified in another yeast two-hybrid screen, in this case looking for p38α-binding partners⁵⁷. TAB1 bound to p38α, but not to the other p38-family members, and when co-expressed in cell lines it increased dual phosphorylation (on Thr180 and Tyr182) of the p38α activation loop and increased p38α kinase activity. This activation was mediated by an MKK-independent mechanism, as dominant-negative forms of MKK3, MKK4, MKK6 or TAK1 failed to prevent it. Notably, the p38-inhibitor SB203580 prevented the dual phosphorylation of p38α when co-expressed with TAB1, indicating that TAB1 caused p38α to autophosphorylate. This was proven with various catalytically inactive p38α mutants, which, although they were dual phosphorylated by MKK6, were not phosphorylated in this way when incubated with TAB1 *in vitro* or when co-expressed with TAB1 in 293 embryonic kidney cells⁵⁷. The autophosphorylation is intramolecular rather than intermolecular, meaning that individual p38α molecules phosphorylate themselves. The ability of TAB1 to induce p38α autophosphorylation is independent of its effects on TAK1. This is shown by a TAB1 mutant that lacks the carboxy-terminal TAK1-interacting amino-acid residues and that has been created artificially⁵⁷, or by a naturally occurring alternatively spliced form of TAB1 (TAB1β)⁶¹. This mutant interacts with p38α but not TAK1, and is able to activate p38α *in vitro* and *in vivo*.

The discovery of TAB1-mediated p38α activation immediately raised the question of whether this pathway has physiological significance, and there are now several examples that indicate it does. For example, there was a reduction in basal and TNF-stimulated p38α activity in a model breast cancer cell line after TAB1β expression was reduced using RNA interference⁶¹. In another case, ischaemia induced similar degrees of p38α activation in myocardial cells from wild-type and MKK3-deficient mice, and p38α activation in the MKK3-deficient cells occurred in the absence of any detectable MKK6 activation⁶². Moreover, the ischaemia-induced activation of p38α was blunted and the volume of infarction was limited by treatment of the cells with SB203580. The finding that TAB1 co-immunoprecipitated with p38α after 10 minutes of ischaemia but not after treatment with TNF (TNF-induced phosphorylation of p38α was SB203580 insensitive in myocardial cells) supported the idea that the ischaemia-induced and MKK-independent activation of p38α uses the TAB1 pathway.

There are several examples linking p38α activation by TAB1 with events of immunological interest. Monocyte-derived immature dendritic cells (DCs) express a cell-surface collagen-binding receptor tyrosine kinase, known as discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1), the ligation of which cooperates with other stimuli to promote DC maturation⁶³. Crosslinking of DDR1 on monocyte-derived DCs resulted in dual phosphorylation and activation of p38α, without detectable activation of MKK3 or MKK6. Moreover, collagen-induced p38 dual phosphorylation was inhibited by SB203580, strongly implicating autophosphorylation in the process⁶³. A complex of TNF-receptor-associated factor 6 (**TRAF6**), p38α and TAB1 were co-immunoprecipitated after DDR1 crosslinking. Interestingly, despite the fact that the DCs expressed both full-length TAB1 and the alternatively spliced product TAB1β, only TAB1β was found in the TRAF6–p38α complex, arguing that TAB1β might be the biologically relevant form in this instance. Correspondingly, no TAK1 (which only binds full-length TAB1) was detected in the complex. Treatment of the cells with SB203580 prevented upregulation of the expression of functionally important molecules, such as CD80, CD86 and MHC class II molecules, following co-stimulation with TNF alone or TNF and DDR1. In a different study, incubation of macrophages with *Toxoplasma gondii* resulted in SB203580-sensitive p38α dual phosphorylation without the activation of upstream MAPKKs, and TAB1 was found to be associated with p38α as early as 10 minutes after infection⁶⁴. Together, these results implicate TAB1-mediated activation of p38α as an important component in innate immunity.

p38 activation, perhaps mediated by TAB1, might also be involved in the induction and maintenance of T-cell anergy⁶⁵. For these studies, CD4⁺ T-cell anergy was established in a model system in which Vβ8.1-transgenic mice were injected with a superantigen that interacts with the transgenic TCR β-chain. Anergized T cells stimulated *in vitro* with TCR-specific antibodies had impaired ERK and JNK phosphorylation, and increased p38α dual phosphorylation that was inhibited by SB203580, fulfilling one criterion for a TAB1-dependent pathway. The link to the anergic phenotype was established in the following two ways: first, inhibition of p38α with SB203580 restored TCR-mediated CD4⁺ T-cell proliferation and IL-2 production, and production of the regulatory cytokine

IL-10 was inhibited; second, enforced expression of TAB1 in a T-cell hybridoma resulted in decreased IL-2 and increased IL-10 production in response to activating stimuli, which is consistent with an anergic phenotype. However, the initial report that TAB1 protein levels increased under anergizing conditions<sup>65</sup> was retracted when it was found that the antibody that had been used did not in fact recognize TAB1 (REF. 66). Therefore, although the link between TAB1 and anergy is tenuous, the data indicate that there is a non-classical (SB203580-sensitive) p38α-activation pathway that can lead to T-cell anergy.

Alternative p38 activation pathway in T cells

p38α and p38β are activated in T cells in response to TCR signalling, which is increased by T-cell co-stimulation<sup>22</sup>. There has been relatively little reported on the molecular events that lead to p38 activation in T cells *per se*, but what data there are have been taken to be supportive of a role for the classical MAPK cascade. For example, the finding that ζ-chain-associated protein kinase of 70 kDa (ZAP70) is required for TCR- and co-stimulation-induced activation of both VAV (a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for RHO-family GTPases) and p38 was interpreted in the context of classical MAPK signalling (that is, p38 activation being downstream of a VAV- and RAC1-dependent MAPKKK)<sup>67</sup>. In another case, TCR-mediated p38 dual phosphorylation was slightly decreased in cells deficient for RAC2 (a RHO-family GTPase that has a proximal role in the MAPK cascade)<sup>68</sup>. These data are compatible with involvement of the MAPK cascade, but are also open to other interpretations. And in fact, a new T-cell MKK-independent p38 activation pathway has recently come to light in the course of characterizing the immune phenotype of mice in which the gene encoding growth arrest and DNA-damage-inducible 45α (GADD45α) had been knocked out.

The GADD45 family

GADD45α was initially identified as a stress-responsive gene<sup>69</sup>. There are three members of the GADD45 family, GADD45α, GADD45β and GADD45γ, which share 55–58% amino-acid identity<sup>70</sup>. The GADD45 proteins are small (~18 kDa) and acidic, with no known intrinsic enzymatic activity, and they function by binding and regulating the activity of several key enzymes. For example, GADD45α binds to cell-division cycle 2 (CDC2), which suppresses the activity of the CDC2–cyclin-B1 complex regulating G<sub>2</sub> to M cell-cycle progression and contributes to the activation of a DNA-damage-induced G<sub>2</sub> to M checkpoint<sup>71</sup>. An immunologically relevant example is the binding of all three GADD45-family members to MAPKKKK4 (also known as MTK1 in humans and MEKK4 in mice), which is an upstream activator of MKK3, MKK6 and other MAPKKs and, therefore, of JNK and p38 (REF. 70). MTK1 occurs in an autoinhibited and enzymatically inactive conformation; GADD45 proteins bind and displace the autoinhibitory domain, which allows access of the catalytic region to downstream MAPKKs<sup>72</sup>. The MAPK-cascade-activating properties of GADD45β and GADD45γ, especially in T cells, have been established in mouse knockout models. Mice that are deficient in GADD45γ have reduced p38α and JNK activation and reduced IFNγ production in response to TCR signalling in T<sub>H</sub>1 cells<sup>73</sup>. CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from animals deficient in GADD45β have an even more severe phenotype, with reduced p38 and less sustained ERK activation following TCR-mediated stimulation, and reduced IL-2 and IFNγ production by T<sub>H</sub>1 cells<sup>74</sup>. These effects are probably directly related to the activation of MEKK4 because animals deficient in MEKK4 also have reduced T<sub>H</sub>1-cell p38 activity and IFNγ production, and retrovirally expressed GADD45β or GADD45γ could not induce p38-dependent IFNγ production in MEKK4-deficient cells<sup>75</sup>.

GADD45α in T cells

Until recently, the role of GADD45α in MAPK activation was unclear. The first studies of animals deficient in GADD45α focused on genomic instability that was manifested by aneuploidy, gene amplification, chromosome abnormalities and aberrant mitosis<sup>76</sup>. Studies using GADD45α-deficient cells showed that p38α activity was not increased by oncogenic H-ras in mouse embryonic fibroblasts, and that p38α and JNK activity in keratinocytes was not sustained after exposure to ultraviolet radiation<sup>77,78</sup>. These observations indicated that GADD45α has a positive role in p38α activation in non-lymphoid tissues<sup>77,78</sup>. The GADD45α-deficient animals seemed remarkably normal despite these abnormalities, but long-term follow-up found that they died prematurely, especially the females<sup>79</sup>. The cause of death proved to be lupus-like autoimmunity. The only abnormality identified in lymphocytes from pre-diseased animals was that T cells were hyper-responsive to TCR-induced proliferation. This hyper-responsiveness was apparently caused by an alteration in proximal TCR signalling, because proliferation in response to stimulation with phorbol ester and calcium ionophore was normal, as was proliferation of B cells stimulated through their antigen receptors. The involvement of GADD45 proteins as positive regulators of p38 prompted an examination of MAPK signalling in T cells. Previous work had found that keratinocytes from mice deficient in GADD45α exhibit only transient p38 activation after exposure to ultraviolet radiation<sup>78</sup>, and this led to the expectation that p38 activation would also be attenuated in GADD45α-deficient T cells. This was not the case, however, and both p38α and p38β dual phosphorylation was increased in freshly isolated resting CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and thymocytes, and there was no evidence of increased activity of the upstream kinases MKK3, MKK4 or MKK6 (REF. 80). Furthermore, p38 from GADD45α-deficient T cells, but importantly not B cells, undergoes robust autophosphorylation *in vitro*. As detailed earlier, a high degree of autophosphorylation indicates a non-MAPK-cascade activation pathway. In this case, the p38 phosphorylation was unlikely to be mediated by TAB1 because both p38α and p38β were active (TAB1 only binds and activates p38α). To distinguish between

an unknown GADD45α-specific pathway and one restricted to T cells, p38α and p38β activation was characterized in activated wild-type T cells<sup>81</sup>. p38α and p38β that were immunoprecipitated from T cells stimulated through the TCR incorporated phosphate when incubated with \[^{32}\text{P}]\)ATP *in vitro*, an event that was prevented by SB203580. Moreover, there was an increase in phosphorylation of Thr180 and Tyr182, and so phosphorylation of the activation loop itself, during the incubation. By contrast, p38α/p38β from B cells stimulated through cell-surface IgM did not show autophosphorylation.

The cell specificity of p38 autophosphorylation indicated that there was a possible direct involvement of TCR-proximal signalling elements. This was confirmed using mutant Jurkat T cells, as Jurkat T cells lacking the SRC-family kinase LCK or ZAP70 were impaired in TCR-induced p38 activation. Linker for activation of T cells (LAT) is a key scaffold protein that mediates the clustering of numerous adaptor proteins and enzymes involved in TCR signalling, and it is required for the initiation of most downstream signalling events, including the signalling cascade leading to ERK activation<sup>82</sup>. LAT was found to be dispensable for p38 activation, indicating that one or more of the LAT-proximal signalling elements, most probably LCK or ZAP70, was directly responsible for p38 activation. In fact, recombinant T-cell SRC-family kinases LCK and FYN as well as ZAP70 were found to phosphorylate p38α *in vitro*<sup>81</sup>. This phosphorylation activated p38α, even when Tyr182 was substituted with phenylalanine. Analysis using high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) of trypsin-cleaved recombinant p38α, which was then sequenced using Edman degradation, showed that there was one main site of phosphorylation on Tyr323, which is present in the C-terminal portion of the protein. Phospho-Tyr323 was also detected using a specific polyclonal antiserum in antigen-receptor-stimulated T cells but not B cells<sup>81</sup>. Recent evidence indicates that a member of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) family of scaffolding proteins might have a role in coupling LCK and ZAP70 to the phosphorylation of Tyr323 of p38 (M. C. Miceli, personal communication). The relative importance of the MAPK cascade compared with the alternative pathway involving ZAP70-mediated phosphorylation of Tyr323 was assessed in two ways. First, epitope-tagged wild-type or Y323F mutant (Tyr323 to Phe323 substitution) p38 were expressed in Jurkat T cells, which were then activated through the TCR. Dual phosphorylation on Thr180 and Tyr182 of the Y323F p38 mutant was markedly impaired, although it was normal in response to phorbol ester stimulation<sup>81</sup>. A second approach was to stimulate normal T cells in the presence or absence of SB203580 to prevent autophosphorylation. p38 dual phosphorylation in activated T cells was almost completely blocked by SB203580, whereas it was normal in activated B cells<sup>81</sup>. It is not clear why antigen-receptor-activated B cells do not use the alternative p38 activation pathway. B cells express spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK), which is closely related to ZAP70, and which can phosphorylate recombinant

Figure 2 | Alternative p38 activation pathway and GADD45α in T cells. Stimulation through the T-cell receptor (TCR) results in sequential activation of LCK and ζ-chain-associated protein kinase of 70 kDa (ZAP70). ZAP70 phosphorylates p38α/p38β on Tyr323, which induces autophosphorylation and activity towards third-party substrates. Although dual phosphorylation of Thr180 and Tyr182 probably enhances p38 activity further, p38α with a phenylalanine at position 182 (and therefore unable to accept a phosphate group) can still be activated by phosphorylation of Tyr323 (REF. 80). Constitutively expressed growth arrest and DNA-damage-inducible 45α (GADD45α) can bind p38α/p38β and inhibit phosphorylation of Tyr323 as well as the activity p38 after it has been phosphorylated on Tyr323.

p38α on Tyr323 *in vitro* (J.D.A. and P. R. Mittelstadt, unpublished observations). Nonetheless, multiple approaches have found no evidence of phosphorylated Tyr323 in activated B cells, perhaps owing to the lack of postulated adaptor proteins, dominance of the classical MAPK pathway or other mechanisms. In any case, the results outlined earlier indicate that the alternative pathway involving Tyr323 phosphorylation is probably an important contributor to p38 activation in T cells stimulated through the TCR. It should be noted that TCR signalling in the presence of CD28-mediated co-stimulation results in the induction of both the classical MAPK cascade and the alternative p38-activation pathway (J.D.A. and J. M. Salvador, unpublished observations). The relative contribution of each pathway to p38 activation under these circumstances remains to be determined.

The aberrant activation of p38 in GADD45α-deficient T cells was examined in light of these findings (FIG. 2). p38 Tyr323 was indeed found to be constitutively

Taken together, the results indicate that, in addition to its positive effects on MTK1 (REF. 70), GADD45α has a direct inhibitory effect on p38 activated by TCR-derived signals and the T-cell alternative pathway (FIG. 3). In T cells GADD45α-mediated inhibition of the alternative pathway predominates, and, in the absence of this constitutive inhibition, p38 becomes spontaneously phosphorylated on Tyr323 and activated. The observation that an LCK inhibitor reversed p38 activation in resting GADD45α-deficient T cells indicates that activation might depend on low level tonic signalling through the TCR<sup>80</sup>.

The mechanism underlying p38 activation by Tyr323 phosphorylation is unknown. One possibility is that this event causes p38 to homodimerize, as occurs with ERK2 and other MAPK-family members<sup>83</sup>. Such a model could explain the specificity of GADD45α for Tyr323-phosphorylated p38, for which it might function as a wedge to prevent dimer formation. Studies in my laboratory so far, however, have not detected homodimeric p38. Another possibility is that phosphorylation of Tyr323 affects the nearby common docking region (BOX 1) and therefore interactions with substrate<sup>84</sup>. Solving the three-dimensional structure of Tyr323-phosphorylated p38 might be required to elucidate the mechanism.

An important unresolved question is whether chronically increased p38 activation contributes to the autoimmunity in GADD45α-deficient mice (and perhaps in other settings). This is difficult to address, because chronic administration of p38 inhibitors for a disease that takes many months to manifest is impractical, and in any case might have effects that are secondary to general immunosuppression or inhibition of p38 activity in cells other than T cells. The introduction of a gene encoding p38α (and perhaps p38β) with the Y323F mutation to GADD45α-deficient mice might provide a definitive answer.

**Concluding remarks**

Until relatively recently there was little doubt that the well-characterized MAPKKK–MAPKK–MAPK cascade accounted for all instances of p38 activation. It has become clear, however, that there are alternative pathways. The reasons why such pathways have evolved are unknown, but they do allow for cell-specific regulation and p38 activation without evoking the many other components of the MAPK cascade. It is also an interesting, if unsupported, speculation that fine specificities for substrate might differ depending on the mechanism of p38 activation. It seems probable that there are as-yet-unidentified alternative pathways: a practical clue to their existence might be autophosphorylation, which is so far characteristic of non-MKK-dependent mechanisms. Given their tissue- and stimulus-restricted nature, alternative p38 activation pathways might be attractive selective targets for intervention in pathological conditions involving inflammation, autoimmunity and tolerance. This would have the benefit that ubiquitous MAPK-cascade-dependent p38 activation would be spared.

Figure 3 | **GADD45α can enhance or inhibit p38 activation.** Growth arrest and DNA-damage-inducible 45α (GADD45α) positively regulates MAPK kinase kinase 4 (MAPKKK4, also known as MTK1 in humans), and therefore the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade. It also inhibits Tyr323 phosphorylation of p38α and p38β and therefore the activity of Tyr323-phosphorylated p38. The alternative pathway dominates in T-cell-receptor (TCR)-mediated T-cell activation, and in the absence of GADD45α, p38α and p38β are spontaneously phosphorylated on Tyr323 and active in cells of the T-cell lineage. MKK, MAPK kinase; ZAP70, ζ-chain-associated protein kinase of 70 kDa.

phosphorylated in the T cells. GADD45α binds p38 (REF. 77), and recombinant full-length GADD45α, but not a mutant that lacks the p38-binding region, inhibited the activity of p38 from GADD45α-deficient T cells. This effect is very specific, because GADD45α inhibited p38 activated by ZAP70 (that is, through phosphorylation of Tyr323) but not by MKK6 (that is, through phosphorylation of Thr180 and Tyr182). The effect of recombinant GADD45α *in vitro* was twofold. GADD45α inhibited the phosphorylation of Tyr323 by ZAP70 and the activity of Tyr323-phosphorylated p38.

Box 1 | **Common docking domains in MAPKs**

Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) have regions in which several closely spaced aspartate residues constitute a local acidic patch that serves as a common docking (commonly called CD) site for proteins that contain a complementary docking domain. Docking domains vary among MAPK-interacting proteins, but a common feature is a linear sequence in which basic and hydrophobic residues are juxtaposed<sup>85</sup>. Common docking site–docking domain interactions have been identified for activators upstream of MAPKs, the MAPK kinases (MAPKKs), inhibitory phosphatases, scaffold proteins and substrates<sup>86</sup>. The position and type of docking site on the interacting protein influences the affinity of binding and directs substrate phosphorylation to particular serine and/or threonine residues<sup>87</sup>. Therefore, the pairing of a particular common docking site with its complementary docking sequence, such as that of extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) for the MAPK-activated protein kinase (MAPKAPK) RSK<sup>88</sup> and of p38 for its upstream activating kinase MAPKK3b (also known as MKK3b) or its downstream substrate myocyte enhancer factor 2A (MEF2A)<sup>89</sup> contributes extensively to the selectivity of MAPK activation and substrate specificity.
