**Autophagosomes: biogenesis from scratch?**

Fulvio Reggiori and Daniel J Klionsky

To survive extreme environmental conditions, and in response to certain developmental and pathological situations, eukaryotic organisms employ the catabolic process of autophagy. This degradative pathway allows cells to eliminate large portions of the cytoplasm, from aberrant protein aggregates to superfluous or damaged organelles and even entire organisms such as invading bacteria. Structures targeted for destruction are sequestered into large double-membrane vesicles called autophagosomes and then delivered into the interior of the lysosome or vacuole, where they are consumed by resident hydrolases. Autophagosome formation during selective autophagy is dependent upon the cargoes, and in all cases seems to involve expansion of the sequestering membrane.

**Introduction**

Autophagy has been known for at least 40 years as an adaptation response to starvation and as the major factor in the turnover of long-lived proteins; however, for much of that time studies about this degradative transport route have been limited to morphological observations. These analyses were phenomenological in nature because none of the specific components making up the autophagic machinery were known. In the last decade, genetic screens in the yeast *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* and in other fungi have led to the isolation of ~17 ATG (autophagy-related) genes whose products are specifically involved in this catabolic pathway [1]. Importantly, most of these genes possess clear homologues in other eukaryotic organisms and several have now been shown to function as orthologues [2,3]. Thus, in recent years, researchers employing more complex model organisms such as *Caenorhabditis elegans*, *Dictyostelium discoideum*,

*Drosophila melanogaster* and mice as well as mammalian cell lines have started to unveil the relevance of autophagy in several physiological processes, either by making specific knockouts of the yeast ATG homologues or alternatively by depleting the corresponding transcripts through the use of RNAi. We now know that autophagy is directly involved in eliminating aberrant protein aggregates, protecting against tumors and defending against pathogen invasions (both viral and bacterial), and that it plays an essential role in development and differentiation; autophagy may also be involved in lifespan extension and possibly in carrying out type-II programmed cell death (Figure 1) [2,4–6].

The general mechanism of autophagy is the sequestration of the cargo material into a large double-membrane vesicle, called an autophagosome, which then fuses with the lysosome/vacuole, liberating the internal vesicle into the interior of this organelle where, together with the cargo, it is degraded by hydrolases (Figure 2). The biogenesis and consumption of this structure can be divided in four discrete morphological steps: induction, which is marked by the initiation of sequestration; the formation and completion stage, during which the cargo becomes enclosed within a completed vesicle; the docking and fusion stage, where the outer vesicle membrane tethers to and fuses with the lysosome/vacuole; and breakdown, which involves lysis of the inner vesicle and degradation of the cargo. The two latter steps have been elucidated because they use the same machinery employed by the other delivery pathways to the lysosome/vacuole [3]. By contrast, despite the advances in understanding the cellular role of autophagy and the fact that most of the identified Atg proteins participate in double membrane vesicle formation, the mechanisms underpinning the first two steps remain largely unknown. This review will focus on the recent advances in understanding these first two steps in autophagosome biogenesis.

**Induction of double-membrane vesicle formation and cargo packing**

Autophagy can be selective or nonselective. It is considered to be selective when a precise cargo is specifically and exclusively incorporated into autophagosomes. By contrast, cytoplasmic structures are randomly enwrapped into double-membrane vesicles during nonselective autophagy. These two types of autophagy seem to differ in the way that they are induced.

There are several examples of selective autophagy. In the yeast *S. cerevisiae*, the vacuolar protease amino peptidase I (Ape1) is delivered from the cytoplasm directly into the

Physiological roles of autophagy. Autophagy plays a normal role in development and cellular remodeling. It is also a stress response that allows survival under starvation conditions. While autophagy plays a role in preventing various diseases, it may also contribute to pathophysiology, depending on the progression of the disease.

vacuole interior via the Cvt (cytoplasm to vacuole targeting) pathway, which is analogous to autophagy. The study of this transport route has provided insights into how specific cargoes are packed into double-membrane vesicles. After synthesis, precursor Ape1 (prApe1) forms a large oligomer that first associates with the Atg19 cargo receptor and then with the Atg11 adaptor to form the Cvt complex [7]. This large cytosolic protein aggregate then moves in close proximity to the vacuole surface, where it induces the recruitment of the rest of the Atg factors, triggering the formation of the double-membrane Cvt vesicle [8*,9] (Figure 3). This perivacuolar organization site is called the pre-autophagosomal structure (PAS) [10,11]. Neither the PAS nor the vesicles are efficiently formed in the absence of any of the Cvt complex components, indicating that the cargo induces the biogenesis of these structures [8*]. These data argue against a previous model in which the Cvt complex is recruited and incorporated into a nascent vesicle. It is still unknown how the Cvt complex is targeted to the vacuole membrane, but what it is clear is that the recruitment of the rest of the Atg protein depends on the ability of Atg11 to interact directly or indirectly with several of them [9]. Atg11 is potentially a universal module for specific types of autophagy; it triggers double-membrane vesicle assembly upon cargo binding in the Cvt pathway, but it is also essential for pexophagy, the process that leads to the specific elimination of peroxisomes by autophagy [12]. In the latter case, Atg11 is anchored to this organelle, possibly via an interaction with Pex14 [13] (Figure 3).

Mammalian cells seem not to possess a transport route similar to the Cvt pathway, and pexophagy has not yet been demonstrated in higher eukaryotes. In addition, Atg11 has homologues only in other yeasts, although this does not exclude the possibility that other organisms have

Conceptual model of autophagy. Cargo destined for destruction is enwrapped by a membrane, leading to the formation of a double-membrane vesicle called an autophagosome. Once the sequestration process is completed, the autophagosome fuses with the lysosome/vacuole. During the fusion event, the external lipid bilayer of the autophagosome becomes part of the lysosome/vacuole surface, whereas the internal vesicle — now termed an autophagic body — is liberated into the interior of this organelle where, together with the cargo, it is degraded by resident hydrolases.

Current Opinion in Cell Biology

Selective autophagy in the yeast S. cerevisiae. (a) Cvt (cytoplasm to vacuole targeting) pathway. After translation, precursor Ape1 rapidly forms an oligomer with which the Atg19 cargo receptor and the Atg11 adaptor associate in succession. This large protein aggregate, termed the Cvt complex, is then transported in proximity of the vacuole surface where it stimulates double-membrane vesicle formation by triggering the recruitment of the rest of the Atg components. (b) Pexophagy. The peripheral membrane factor Pex3 and the transmembrane polypeptide Pex14 form a complex on the peroxisome surface. Pexophagy induction causes the rapid proteasomal degradation of Pex3. Exposed Pex14 is probably able to bind Atg11 and this association provokes a series of events similar to those of the Cvt pathway that lead to cargo sequestration into the double-membrane vesicles. (c) Mitophagy. Uth1 is an integral mitochondrial outer membrane protein required for the degradation of this organelle by autophagy [29]. It is unknown if this factor binds Atg components, but it is possible that mitochondria are specifically sequestered into autophagosomes using a targeting machinery analogous to that of both the Cvt pathway and pexophagy.

a different molecule fulfilling the same function [3]. Interestingly, it has recently been shown that autophagy can be selective in mammalian cells, as evidenced by the specific recognition and elimination of invading bacteria including group A Streptococcus, Shigella flexneri, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Legionella pneumophila and uropathogen FimH+ Escherichia coli, and potentially also of intracellular Epstein-Barr and herpes simplex viruses [14,15,16**,17*, 18,19**]. However, it is unclear how autophagy is modulated in these situations.

An interesting insight has been provided by the study of S. flexneri [16**]. VirG is a protein on the surface of this bacterium that is required for its intracellular actin-based motility. In the ΔiscB mutant, this factor can bind Atg5 and the association between these two polypeptides induces autophagy, leading to specific pathogen encapsulation into autophagosomes. By contrast, wild-type S. flexneri escape autophagy by secreting IscB, a protein that competitively inhibits the binding of VirG to Atg5. As mentioned, Atg11 binds several other Atg factors, but apparently it does not bind Atg5. These two different ways of triggering double-membrane vesicle formation could reflect a difference between species but could also suggest that selective autophagy can be induced by

diverse cargo–Atg protein interactions and is not limited to direct binding of Atg5; it seems unlikely that eukaryotic cells have been able to generate a small (35 kDa) molecule, Atg5, that is able to recognize such a wide range of cargoes. In addition, it is possible that cells possess a set of chaperones able to identify foreign components and endogenous aberrant protein aggregates. Binding to these substrates would induce the association of these putative chaperones with the autophagy machinery and trigger the process. This detection system would also provide a specific incorporation mechanism. The existence of such a class of monitoring factors could explain why the Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1), neomycin phosphotransferase II (NeoR), and possibly mutant huntingtin and long-lived proteins are specifically incorporated into autophagosomes [18,20*,21].

In contrast to selective autophagy, which is triggered by an intracellular component, the nonselective process is governed by extracellular stimuli such as nutrients or cytokines [6,19**,22*]. This type of induction has been elegantly demonstrated in S. cerevisiae. In growing conditions, the PAS and double-membrane vesicles are not formed in the absence of the Cvt complex, but this inability is overcome when cells are nitrogen-starved

www.sciencedirect.com                                                                 Current Opinion in Cell Biology 2005, 17:415-422
[8*,12]. Accordingly, this induction mechanism seems not to be due to a cargo–Atg protein interaction. One possibility is that the different signaling cascades that occur in response to various extracellular cues lead to the modification of one or more Atg factors, resulting in the activation of the autophagosome formation machinery. In *S. cerevisiae*, starvation causes the partial dephosphorylation of Atg13 [23]. Hypophosphorylated Atg13 then binds with higher affinity to Atg1, stimulating its protein kinase activity. This event is necessary for autophagosome biogenesis but seems to be unnecessary for the primary induction, as the PAS is clearly assembled in *atg1Δ* cells [7,8*,10,24**]. Furthermore, higher levels of Atg1 kinase activity are needed for the Cvt pathway than are needed for autophagy [25,26]. Atg1 and Atg13 are probably involved in a different step of double-membrane vesicle formation from induction [24**]. In addition, Atg13 has homologues only in other yeast and plants, implying that higher eukaryotes regulate Atg1 kinase activity in a different way [3].

Studies in the yeast *S. cerevisiae* have also indicated that nonselective autophagy can show a degree of specificity. During the first hours of starvation, this pathway mostly degrades cytosol. The vacuole only begins to dispose of organelles such as the endoplasmic reticulum if starvation persists for several hours [27]. It is unclear how this phenomenon is regulated. One possibility is that at a particular moment, an adaptor molecule that permits the efficient targeting of these structures into double-membrane vesicles is activated or made accessible to the Atg machinery, as is the case with peroxisomes: Pex3 sterically shields Pex14, but the former protein dissociates from the peroxisome and is degraded, allowing access to Pex14 under conditions where peroxisome function is no longer essential [28]. An alternative model is suggested by the observation that the endoplasmic reticulum undergoes partial fragmentation to be sequestered into autophagosomes [27]. In general, the endoplasmic reticulum is too large to be enwrapped by autophagosomes, an attribute that may prevent random uptake and destruction. A similar situation exists with the reticular mitochondria. Induction of the break-up of the endoplasmic reticulum, and eventually of the mitochondrial network, could be the event that facilitates their random uptake by autophagosomes. It is also possible that specific targeting and fragmentation both take place. For mitochondria in particular there is evidence that this organelle can be selectively targeted for degradation [29].

### Autophagosome formation and completion

The large majority of the schematic representations of the autophagy process found in the literature, including our Figure 2, are somewhat misleading because they suggest that a single, continuous and preformed membrane is participating in the sequestration event. Recent findings in mammalian cells have challenged this simplified idea

by indicating that, after induction, the elongation of a small template membrane, termed the isolation membrane or phagophore, leads to autophagosome formation [30–32] (Figure 4; note that the expansion, completion and uncoating steps all correspond to the ‘formation and completion’ stage shown in Figure 2). We believe that this structure corresponds to the yeast PAS. The surface of this small compartment is decorated with Atg5 and Atg16 and its generation requires phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity [31,33]. Conjugation of the ubiquitin-like Atg12 to Atg5 seems to be the induction step that triggers the elongation of this cisterna. It is not known how the Atg12—Atg5 complex recruits additional lipid bilayers, but the crescent autophagosome acquires more Atg12—Atg5 and Atg16 along with a second ubiquitin-like molecule, Atg8/LC3, that is unconventionally linked to phosphatidylethanolamine. It is interesting to note that this general mechanism is recapitulated during *S. flexneri ΔiscB* mutant encapsulation into double-membrane vesicles [16**].

A related question is how the membrane precursors to autophagosomes are molded into a spherical vesicle. In the Cvt pathway the cargo may serve as a scaffold for expansion of the sequestering membrane (Figure 3); however, in nonselective autophagy this option is not available. In one possible model, the Atg12—Atg5 and Atg16 complex starts to polymerize at the tips of the isolation membrane, forming a proteinaceous skeleton that promotes the ordered assembly of Atg8/LC3-containing membranes in a process that also drives the double-membrane vesicle curvature (Figure 4). Several observations support this idea. First, the isolation membrane is not elongated in cells expressing an Atg5 point mutant that cannot be linked with Atg12 [31]. Second, the Atg12—Atg5 conjugate binds Atg16 and this trimeric complex then oligomerizes [33,34]. Third, the Atg12—Atg5—Atg16 complex localizes to the external surface of the forming autophagosome [31,33]. Fourth, in the absence of Atg5, Atg12 or Atg16, Atg8/LC3 is lipidated and consequently associates with lipid bilayers, but it is not recruited to the phagophore membrane [10]; Atg8/LC3 is also less stable in the absence of these other components. Finally, Atg8/LC3 is required for double-membrane vesicle expansion [35,36]. The transitional action of the Atg12—Atg5—Atg16 conjugate as a structural support or eventually as a coat is also emphasized by the fact that this complex, along with part of the Atg8/LC3 population, dissociates from the autophagosome surface once this structure is completed [31,37] (Figure 4).

During selective autophagy, double-membrane vesicle formation doesn’t exclusively rely on the Atg12—Atg5—Atg16 complex; rather, the cargo probably plays an active role in directing the membrane elongation. The ability of the Cvt vesicle or pexophagosome to shape itself around the cargo could guarantee the specificity of the Cvt

Double-membrane vesicle nucleation and formation. The covalent linkage of Atg12 to the Atg5 pool present on the isolation membrane/phagophore surface triggers autophagosome formation. Additional cytosolic Atg12—Atg5 conjugate and Atg16 are recruited to this compartment and start to redistribute and concentrate mostly on the external lipid bilayer. The Atg12—Atg5—Atg16 complex then forms larger oligomers that dictate the elongation and curvature of the phagophore by conveying Atg8-containing membranes into the crescent structure. Once the autophagosome is completed, the Atg12—Atg5 conjugate and Atg16 dissociate from this structure, whereas Atg4 releases the Atg8 on the external lipid bilayer into the cytosol by proteolytically cleaving this molecule from the lipid moiety. This uncoating event allows the autophagosome to fuse with the lysosome/vacuole.

pathway or pexophagy by avoiding the incorporation of other undesired cytoplasmic components. Cargoes of this pathway, such as the Cvt complex, peroxisomes and bacteria, can be seen in close apposition to the inner membrane of the double-membrane vesicles [16**,17**, 19**,38–40]. It is interesting to note that Atg8 interacts with one of the Cvt complex components, Atg19 [7]. In addition, this directed expansion mechanism could also potentially allow these vesicles to modulate their size, permitting them to accommodate cargoes with diverse volumes [16**,17*,19**,40].

The model presented in Figure 4 is far from proven and does not incorporate several Atg proteins known to be involved in these steps, as their role is still unclear. It is also unknown how many different types of membrane are utilized and from which organelle they are derived, although the endoplasmic reticulum seems to be a principal source [41]. For example, it has been recently shown that the transmembrane protein Atg9 cycles through the PAS, potentially supplying the forming double-membrane vesicles with lipids or lipid bilayers [24**]. However, it is unclear if Atg9 is part of the phagophore, the Atg8-containing membranes or a different structure. Another mystery is how the membrane of the phagophore elongates. Two mechanisms are possible (Figure 5), one that relies on delivery of lipid bilayer by vesicular traffic (vesicular expansion) and one based on the fusion of small compartments (cisternal expansion). It appears that the fusion of the supplied membranes may be, at least in yeast, SNARE-independent [42,43]. In addition, it has been suggested that retrograde traffic plays a role in double-membrane vesicle biogenesis [24**,42–45], serving to recycle some Atg proteins such as Atg9 and also recovering from the forming autophagosome membrane components specific to the compartment(s) of origin.

As mentioned, once the autophagosome is completed, the externally localized Atg8, the Atg12—Atg5—16 complex and the rest of the Atg components dissociate from this vesicle, which is then ready to fuse with the lysosome/vacuole. Only proteins such as the part of Atg8 that remains trapped inside the completed vesicle continue to accompany this structure on its journey toward degradation [36]. It is still unknown which factor senses completion of the double-membrane vesicle and triggers this disassembly mechanism. One possible candidate is Atg1, because it acts at a late stage of autophagosome biogenesis and is also required for the release of Atg11 [9] and the retrieval of Atg9 from this structure [10,24**]. It has been postulated that regulation of Atg1 activity is a key factor determining autophagosome size [24**].

### Conclusions

The study of the molecular mechanism that leads to autophagosome formation is still in an early phase. Most of the work has been done in yeasts, but with the identification of the ATG orthologues, the study of this transport pathway in other model organisms has started to lead rapidly to the acquisition of new information. The most fundamental question that has to be answered is how double-membrane vesicle lipid bilayers are assembled during both selective and nonselective autophagy. Solving this issue will facilitate the assignment of precise roles to the different Atg proteins involved in this process. Additional use of electron microscopy techniques, along with the development of an *in vitro* reconstitution system for autophagosome biogenesis, will also have a major impact. A biochemical approach, however, is particularly difficult because the origin of the lipid bilayers used to form the double-membrane vesicles is still unknown.

During the last decade, the field of autophagy has slowly emerged from relative anonymity. The enormous interest it has recently attracted leads us to predict that the next years will be very exciting, and that the expansion of our knowledge about the physiological role of this catabolic transport route will be accompanied by major advances in our understanding of its molecular mechanism.

### Update

Using conditional ATG7 knock-out mice, Chiba and colleagues [46] have recently shown that autophagy is essential for long-lived proteins and organelle turnover in both

the presence and the absence of nutrients. Importantly, the mutant animal accumulates numerous ubiquitinated aggregates in the cytosol, suggesting that this covalent protein modification could serve to target specifically to autophagosomes large structures that have to be eliminated. It is still unclear if some Atg components are able to recognize certain types of ubiquitin chains or if there are some factors (e.g. chaperones) that bind to ubiquitinated proteins and present them to the isolation membrane. Alternatively, large ubiquitinated masses are taken up non-specifically within autophagosomes. It should be noted that sperm mitochondria are known to be ubiquitinated before degradation during fertilization [47].

Another recent paper [48] reveals that INFγ-induced autophagic cell death requires Fas-associated protein with death domain (FADD), and autophagosome formation is probably triggered by the interaction of this factor with Atg5.

Thus, double-membrane vesicles are not formed in the absence of the major cargo molecule (prApe1), its receptor (Atg19) or the Atg11 adaptor. Importantly, the cargo complex is unnecessary for autophagosome biogenesis during starvation-induced nonselective autophagy.

M. tuberculosis infects macrophages, where it manages to reside long-term in the phagosome by interfering with phagolysosome biogenesis. Although the details of the mechanism are still unclear, this study demonstrates that this pathogen can be eliminated by autophagy when this process is induced by starvation or by rapamycin and IFN-γ treatment. The results obtained with IFN-γ are particularly intriguing because they suggest that the immune system can raise intracellular defenses against pathogens by using this cytokine.

Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is incorporated into huntingtin aggregates in cell models, transgenic mice and human brains. This sequestration impairs mTOR kinase activity and hence induces autophagy, which plays a key role in disposing of these large toxic aggregates. Consequently, rapamycin protects against neurodegeneration in a fly model of Huntington’s disease, whereas inhibition of autophagy has the opposite effect.

The authors show that the integral membrane protein Atg9 cycles through the PAS, revealing for the first time a retrograde transport route from this site. The Atg9 recycling is regulated by the Atg1 and Atg13 proteins and requires Atg18, Atg2 and the phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate generated by the Atg14-containing phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase complex. This pathway is mechanistically similar to the retrieval systems from endosomes.
