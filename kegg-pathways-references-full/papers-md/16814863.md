### Abstract

Although originally characterised as a reproductive hormone, relaxin has emerged as a multi-functional endocrine and paracrine factor that plays a number of important roles in several organs, including the normal and diseased cardiovascular system. The recent discovery of the H3/relaxin-3 gene, and the elusive receptors for relaxin (Relaxin family peptide receptor; RXFP1) and relaxin-3 (RXFP3/RXFP4) have led to the re-classification of a distinct relaxin peptide/receptor family. Additionally, the identification of relaxin and RXFP1 mRNA and/or relaxin binding sites in the heart and blood vessels has confirmed that the cardiovascular system is a target for relaxin peptides. While evidence for the production of relaxins within the cardiovascular system is limited, several studies have established that the relaxin genes are upregulated in the diseased human and rodent heart where they likely act as cardioprotective agents. The ability of relaxin to protect the heart is most likely mediated via its antifibrotic, anti-hypertrophic, anti-inflammatory and vasodilatory actions, but it may also directly stimulate myocardial regeneration and repair. This review describes relaxin and its primary receptor (RXFP1) in relation to the roles and effects of relaxin in the normal and pathological cardiovascular system. It is becoming increasingly clear that relaxin has a number of diverse physiological and pathological roles in the cardiovascular system that may have important therapeutic and clinical implications.

pregnancy in most species (Conrad, 2004). Moreover, there is now evidence that relaxin is produced by the heart and acts locally through its receptor as a cardioprotective agent (Dschietzig et al., 2001b) and as a regulator of extracellular matrix (ECM) turnover (Samuel, 2005). Indeed relaxin has been used in numerous animal models to successfully treat cardiac fibrosis and has enormous potential as an agent to treat cardiac fibrosis in humans. The roles of relaxin in the cardiovascular system and its potential use as a drug to treat cardiovascular disease will be outlined in detail over the coming pages.

## 2. Relaxin family peptides

It is now well established that relaxin is a member of a family of peptide hormones that diverged from insulin early in vertebrate evolution to form the relaxin peptide family (Hsu, 2003; Wilkinson et al., 2005). This peptide family is encoded by 7 genes in humans, the relaxin genes RLN1, RLN2 and RLN3 and the insulin-like peptide genes INSL3, INSL4, INSL5 and INSL6. Although the peptides display relatively low primary amino acid sequence homology (Fig. 2), phylogenetic analysis indicates that they evolved from a RLN3 ancestral gene (Hsu, 2003; Wilkinson et al., 2005). Furthermore, most of the peptides of this family interact with related G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR) (outlined below). Importantly, the peptides that make up this family have distinct expression profiles and biological functions. Thus relaxin-3 is expressed predominantly in the brain and has putative actions as a neurotransmitter (Burazin et al., 2002; Bathgate et al., 2003; Tanaka et al., 2005). INSL3 is expressed in the testis and ovary and is essential for testicular descent in the male (Nef & Parada, 1999; Zimmermann et al., 1999). Additionally, INSL3 has roles in oocyte maturation and male germ cell survival (Kawamura et al., 2004). INSL4-6 are predominantly expressed in the placenta, gut and testis, respectively, but their physiological roles are currently unknown.

Unlike humans and higher primates most species have only 2 relaxin genes, corresponding to RLN2 and RLN3. The product of the human RLN2 gene, human gene-2 relaxin (H2 relaxin) is the functional ortholog of the gene product from non-primate species that is termed “species” relaxin (e.g. rat relaxin, mouse relaxin). The function of the product of the human RLN1 gene, human gene-1 relaxin (H1 relaxin) is unknown, and indeed a native H1 relaxin peptide has yet to be isolated. Hence

throughout this review “relaxin” will refer to H2 relaxin and non-primate “species” relaxin.

## 3. Relaxin family peptide receptors

### 3.1. Discovery of relaxin family peptide receptors

The receptors for relaxin, relaxin-3, INSL3 and INSL5 were identified recently (Table 1). Relaxin and INSL3 receptors are a subgroup (type C) of the family of leucine-rich repeat containing G-protein coupled receptors (LGR) that include the receptors for follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). By using inferences from similar phenotypic expression following mutation and inactivation of INSL3 (Nef & Parada, 1999; Zimmermann et al., 1999) and a transgenic insertional mutation in mouse chromosome 5, an orphan LGR designated either G-protein coupled receptor affecting testis descent (GREAT) (Overbeek et al., 2001) or LGR8 (Hsu et al., 2002; Kumagai et al., 2002) was identified as the INSL3 receptor. The discovery that the orphan receptor LGR7 was the relaxin receptor was largely attributable to the pursuit of a hunch raised by the combination of the similarity of the structure of LGR7 to LGR8 and the similarity of the structure of relaxin to INSL3 (Hsu et al., 2002). LGR7 and LGR8, which are 757 (Hsu et al., 2002) and 737 (Overbeek et al., 2001) amino acids in length, respectively, share about 60% amino acid sequence identity and contain 10 leucine-rich repeats (LRR) in their large N-terminal extracellular domain. Two orphan GPCR designated GPCR135 and GPCR142 were recently proposed as putative receptors for relaxin-3 (Liu et al., 2003a, 2003b). Both receptors belong to the type I family of GPCRs. Unlike LGR7 and LGR8, GPCR135 and GPCR142 have short N-terminal extracellular domains, and they contain only 469 and 374 amino acid residues, respectively. CHO-K1 cells transfected with orphan receptor GPCR135, which is also known as somatostatin and angiotensin-like peptide receptor (SALPR; Matsumoto et al., 2000), were used to identify relaxin-3 as a ligand in porcine brain extracts (Liu et al., 2003b). GPCR142, the remaining orphan GPCR receptor that shares the closest amino acid sequence identity to GPCR135 (43%), was also shown to be a receptor for relaxin-3 (Liu et al., 2003b). More recent experiments have demonstrated that GPCR142 is likely the receptor for INSL5 (Liu et al., 2005). Thus most of the receptors

nematodes (Hsu et al., 2000). Therefore, the Type C LGR signalling pathway represents one of the earliest forms of GPCR signalling. The Type C LGR ectodomain consists of a low density lipoprotein class A (LDLa) module, followed by an alternatively spliced flanking region, and LRR. Cysteine rich regions form “caps” at each end of the LRR, and these “caps” have been demonstrated to be an integral part of the LRR structure in many proteins (Kobe & Kajava, 2001). The ectodomain is connected to the 7-transmembrane spanning regions followed by the C-terminal tail (Fig. 3). Based on differential splicing in the ectodomain, many different isoforms of the receptors can be generated (Muda et al., 2005; Scott et al., 2005b). In mouse, rat and pig, an exon 4-deleted RXFP1 splice variant has been discovered (Scott et al., 2005b) where removal of exon 4 causes a frame-shift resulting in a premature stop codon and production of a truncated protein (RXFP1-truncate) that encodes primarily the LDLa module without the LRR or transmembrane region. When cells were co-transfected with plasmids containing RXFP1 and the secreted RXFP1-truncate, relaxin induced RXFP1 signalling was significantly reduced suggesting that this protein acts as a functional antagonist in vitro and may be an endogenous regulator of RXFP1 function.

A comparison of phenotypes of mice deficient in INSL3 (Nef & Parada, 1999; Zimmermann et al., 1999) and mice lacking a 550-kb region of chromosome 3 which contained the RXFP2 gene (Overbeek et al., 2001) led to the hypothesis that relaxin

### 3.2. The RXFP1 receptor

Due to their 2-chain structure, the relaxin and INSL3 peptides were originally thought to belong to the insulin ligand family and several of the relaxin paralogs have been named INSL3–6 based on their order of discovery. Based on the hypothesized coevolution of peptide ligands and their receptors, it was originally believed that the receptor for relaxin was related to the known insulin receptors and thus likely to be a tyrosine kinase.

Recent advances in genome sequencing have facilitated the identification of novel genes based on their sequence relatedness to known genes in the hormonal signalling pathway (Hsu et al., 2000). Searches for paralogs of the known gonadotropin and thyrotropin receptors led to the identification of a group of GPCRs called LGRs. LGRs resemble glycoprotein hormone receptors (Hsu et al., 1998, 2000) that are mosaic proteins that contain an extracellular domain with multiple LRR that are important in ligand binding, and a typical GPCR 7-transmembrane domain. Studies of LGRs from different species suggest that 3 LGR subtypes (A, B and C) evolved during the early evolution of metazoans and that each subtype of LGR shares a similar LRR domain and a unique hinge region between the LRR and the transmembrane region (Fig. 3) (Hsu, 2003). The Type A LGRs include the follicle-stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR), the luteinizing hormone receptor (LHR) and the thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR), important for signalling of the heterodimeric glycoprotein hormones FSH, LH, and TSH, respectively. In mammals, the Type B LGRs comprise 3 orphan GPCRs, LGR4–6. By contrast, Type C LGRs have only 2 members, RXFP1 and RXFP2 (Table 1). Because Type A LGR and the coevolved genes encoding glycoprotein hormone subunits could be traced to both nematodes and insects, it was concluded that the 3 LGR subtypes evolved before the emergence of vertebrates and

Fig. 3. Schematic representation showing the putative structure of the RXFP1 receptor. The major structural features include 7-transmembrane spanning domains, hinge-like region, extracellular LRR, and LDLa module. The model was constructed based on the structures of bovine rhodopsin (Okada & Palczewski, 2001) for the transmembrane domains, FSH receptor (Fan & Hendrickson, 2005) for the LRR and complement-like repeat CR8 from the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (Huang et al., 1999) for the LDLa module. The LDLa module structure contains a Ca²⁺ molecule which is necessary for the structure (Hopkins et al., 2005).
family peptides were cognate ligands for Type C LGRs (Hsu et al., 2002). Functional studies established that porcine relaxin (Hsu et al., 2002) and H2 relaxin (Sudo et al., 2003) activate both RXFP1 and RXFP2 to increase cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) with similar potency and efficacy. RXFP1 and RXFP2 have more than 700 residues, share about 60% amino acid sequence identity and contain 10 LRR in their extracellular domain. RXFP1 transcripts are found in reproductive tissues, as well as brain, kidney, heart, and lung, where actions of relaxin have been reported. The rat and mouse orthologs of RXFP1 have recently been cloned (Scott et al., 2004), and are able to bind H2 relaxin with high affinity and when activated increase cAMP accumulation. Both receptors have a higher affinity for rat relaxin than the human receptor and also bind human gene-3 relaxin (H3 relaxin) with high affinity (Scott et al., 2005a). Examination of the closely related relaxin-3 and INSL3 has demonstrated that these peptides can selectively activate RXFP1 and RXFP2, respectively (Kumagai et al., 2002; Sudo et al., 2003; Bathgate et al., 2006c), although relaxin-3 also potently activates RXFP3/4. The ectodomains of both RXFP1 and RXFP2 are important for ligand binding, as in the case of Type A LGR (Osuga et al., 1997). When a soluble ligand-binding region of RXFP1 (RXFP1-BP) was administered subcutaneously to antagonize endogenous circulating relaxin during the last 4 days of pregnancy, delivery was delayed by 27 hr and nipple development was retarded (Hsu et al., 2002). It is likely that RXFP1-BP blocks the action of relaxin in late pregnancy by acting as a relaxin binding protein (BP) and sequestering circulating relaxin. The phenotype is consistent with earlier work on relaxin (Zhao et al., 1999) and RXFP1 (Krajnc-Franken et al., 2004) null mice and with studies that show delivery of pups is prolonged in rats treated with a monoclonal antibody against relaxin (Lao-Guico & Sherwood, 1988). The phenotype is less pronounced in relaxin knockout (KO) mice where some were observed to have difficulties in giving birth (Zhao et al., 1999) perhaps reflecting partial compensation for the lack of relaxin during development and maturation.

Relaxin is therefore the cognate ligand for RXFP1 and, although relaxin peptides from some species will activate RXFP2 at high (supra-physiological) concentrations, rat relaxin does not activate human, rat or mouse RXFP2, indicating that in rodents, relaxin is not an RXFP2 ligand (Scott et al., 2005a). Studies crossing INSL3 overexpressing mice, RXFP2 and RXFP1 KO mice establish that RXFP2 is the only receptor for INSL3 and there is no interaction (at least in the gubernaculum) between the INSL3/RXFP2 and relaxin/ RXFP1 signalling systems in vivo (Bogatcheva et al., 2003; Kamat et al., 2004).

Thus, in spite of their structural similarity, relaxin and insulin family peptides act through independent signalling pathways: the relaxin group activates GPCRs whereas the insulin group activates tyrosine kinases. Phylogenetic analysis of LGR and coevolved relaxin family peptides from different metazoans suggests that, whereas the number of relaxin receptors remained constant during vertebrate evolution, the ancestral gene for relaxin duplicated multiple times in a vertebrate branch-specific

manner (Hsu, 2003). Therefore, relaxin family peptides from different branches of vertebrates may have adapted to distinct physiological roles via a limited number of receptor genes.

### 3.3. Features of relaxin receptors

#### 3.3.1. General features of leucine rich repeat containing receptors

There are 3 LGR subgroups that all have multiple LRR but have differences in their ectodomain features including the unique “hinge” region linking the LRR to the transmembrane domains (Fig. 3). Type A ectodomains contain 9 LRR and include the receptors for FSH, LH and TSH. Type B ectodomains contain 17 LRR and are currently orphan receptors. Type C ectodomains contain 10 LRR and an N-terminal LDLa module and are the RXFP1 (LGR7) and RXFP2 (LGR8) receptors (Hsu, 2003). RXFP1 and RXFP2 receptors are highly conserved across species, with more than 90% sequence similarity observed between rodent and primate receptors. Both receptors have N-linked glycosylation sites and activate adenylate cyclase to cause cAMP accumulation and stimulation of protein kinase-A (PKA) pathways (Hsu, 2003). The LRR region of these receptors is made up of individual repeats consisting of a β-strand and an α-helix connected by a turn. The crystal structure of the ectodomain of the related FSH receptor has been solved (Fan & Hendrickson, 2005). The LRR of the FSH receptor form an elongated tube like structure, which is slightly curved and FSH binds in a hand clasp fashion to the β-strands which make up the inner concave surface of the LRR. There is a differential distribution of electrostatic charge across the surfaces of the LRR region that is important for ligand recognition (Vassart et al., 2004). The crystallized FSH/FSH receptor complex demonstrates that the ligand receptor interface contains an exceptionally high-buried charge density. There are many direct interactions between acidic residues in the LRR and basic residues in FSH.

It has been proposed that LGR have an inherently noisy transmembrane domain (i.e. they display constitutive activity) that is inhibited by the ectodomain that acts as a tethered inverse agonist to actively ‘switch off’ receptor activation. Once the hormone is bound to the LGR the ectodomain switches from a tethered inverse agonist to a full agonist with the LDLa domain interacting with the transmembrane region of the receptor (Vassart et al., 2004).

It has been suggested that the interaction of glycoprotein hormone receptors with their cognate ligands does not require the 7-TM region since there is high affinity binding to the soluble ectodomain (Vassart et al., 2004; Fan & Hendrickson, 2005). However, mutations of the exoloops of the 7-TM region indicate that exoloo p 2 and the hinge region have an important role in ligand recognition, but their importance lies in binding and positioning of the ligand for interaction with the LRR rather than directly causing activation of the receptor (Vassart et al., 2004). The role of the 7-TM region is also indicated by naturally occurring polymorphisms of the FSH receptor involving the 7-TM region that show increased sensitivity to hCG and constitutive activity (Vassart et al., 2004). Currently there areno known polymorphisms of RXFP1–4 receptors with similar characteristics.

Like other glycoprotein hormone receptors, the ectodomains of RXFP1 and RXFP2 are also a primary site of ligand binding. Ectodomain-only LGR7 (7BP, RXFP1-BP) and RXFP2 (8BP, RXFP2-BP) CD8 membrane anchored receptors demonstrate high affinity binding of relaxin and INSL3 (Halls et al., 2005c). The soluble form of RXFP1-BP is released by the action of thrombin on a thrombin cleavage site located at the RXFP1-CD8 junction and will also bind relaxin and blocks its actions at the RXFP1 receptor presumably by acting as a relaxin BP (Hsu et al., 2002). Indeed, RXFP1-BP acted in the same manner as anti-relaxin antibodies (Hsu et al., 2002) and the effects were not observed if RXFP1-BP was boiled prior to addition to the system (Hsu et al., 2002). However, also like the glycoprotein hormone receptors, the 7-TM region has a role in RXFP1 and RXFP2 binding (Halls et al., 2005c; see below). The RXFP1 receptors therefore have a complex extracellular domain containing an LRR region that forms the primary binding site and a LDLa module at the N-terminus that is important for signal transduction. The e2 region of the TM region of the receptor contains a low-affinity secondary binding site.

### 3.3.2. Functional domains of the RXFP1 receptor

The RXFP1 receptor is a LRR-containing GPCR with a complex ectodomain (Fig. 3). A number of regions have been identified that are critical for ligand binding and signal transduction. These are the LDLa module, the LRR and exoloop 2 of the transmembrane (TM) domain (Fig. 3). Studies carried out using the wild type receptors, RXFP1 and RXFP2 chimeras and membrane anchored ectodomains show that H2 relaxin activates both RXFP1 and RXFP2 whereas H3 relaxin activates only RXFP1 but not RXFP2 (Sudo et al., 2003). For RXFP1 the primary binding site is located in the LRR region since the RXFP1-BP membrane anchored ectodomain displays high affinity binding for \[^{33}\text{P}]\) H2 relaxin (Halls et al., 2005c; Yan et al., 2005). Loss of the LDLa module does not affect binding but signalling is abolished (Bathgate & Hsueh, unpublished data). Furthermore, optimal binding and signal transduction is only observed in receptors having an intact TM domain. The chimeric receptor LGR7/8 (RXFP1/2) containing the ectodomain of RXFP1 receptor and the TM domain of RXFP2 displays decreased cAMP production in response to H3 relaxin and a reduced ability of H3 relaxin to compete for \[^{33}\text{P}]\) H2 relaxin binding (Sudo et al., 2003). Replacement of exoloop 2 in the chimera with that of the RXFP1 receptor restored both H3 relaxin binding and cAMP production (Sudo et al., 2003). This suggests that the TM2 loop has a role to play in binding and signal transduction. This is supported by recent studies (Halls et al., 2005c) demonstrating in the RXFP1/RXFP2 receptor chimera that there is reduced affinity and efficacy of H2 relaxin and increased affinity and efficacy of INSL3. In the RXFP2 (LGR8) receptor the evidence for the presence of 2 binding sites is much stronger since \[^{33}\text{P}]\) H2 relaxin identifies 2 binding sites with differing affinities (Halls et al., 2005c). The corresponding RXFP2-BP (LGR8-BP) displays only a single high affinity site (Halls et al., 2005c).

Thus in the RXFP1 receptor the LRR forms the primary binding site for the cognate ligand relaxin. For RXFP1 it has been suggested that the contact motif is RXXXRXX(I/V) (Sudo et al., 2003). It has recently been demonstrated that this motif interacts with specific residues on the inner β-sheets of the LRR of RXFP1 (Bullesbach & Schwabe, 2005). Arg B-13 interacts with Glu277 and Asp279 of human RXFP1 whereas Arg B-16 interacts with Glu233 and Asp231. Hydrophobic interactions between Ile B20 and various amino acids on the inner β-sheets of the LRR likely stabilize the binding interaction. It is likely that interaction of this motif with the LRR would then allow the ligand to make contact with exoloop 2 of the TM domain that causes the conformation of the ectodomain to change allowing the LDLa module to direct G-protein coupling and subsequently adenylate cyclase activation.

Examination of the amino-acid sequence of the RXFP1 receptor reveals N-glycosylation sites in the ectodomain and the size of RXFP1, and RXFP1-BP on Western blots is consistent with the ectodomain being highly glycosylated (Hsu et al., 2002; Kumagai et al., 2002; Yan et al., 2005). The C-terminal region of RXFP1 has been examined for Ser, Thr and Tyr residues that could represent sites for protein kinase phosphorylation. The RXFP1 receptor has 2 conserved motifs in the C-terminal tail that fulfil these criteria, an RQRKSMDSK motif immediately distal to helix 8, and a SQSTRLNSYS motif at the C-terminus. These are similar to predicted and/or consensus sequences for protein kinase-C (PKC) isozymes, including PKCζ. In particular, the C-terminal motif has the required Arg at the −3 position and a hydrophobic residue at +1 (Nishikawa et al., 1997).

The suggestions regarding phosphorylation of the RXFP1 receptor are qualified by the fact that there are known kinase substrates that lack the typical consensus sequences and hypotheses about receptor phosphorylation will have to be tested by experimental approaches including use of inhibitors, direct measurements of phosphorylation in the presence or absence of dominant-negative kinase mutants, and study of receptor mutants lacking the putative target residues.

### 3.4. Signalling pathways activated by relaxin

#### 3.4.1. Cyclic adenosine monophosphate generation in response to RXFP1 activation

Early studies of the biochemical effects of relaxin demonstrated increases in cAMP in target tissues (Braddon, 1978; Cheah & Sherwood, 1980; Sanborn et al., 1980). Increased intracellular cAMP was observed in mouse pubic symphysis (Braddon, 1978), rat uterus (Cheah & Sherwood, 1980; Judson et al., 1980; Sanborn et al., 1980) and in cultures of rat (Hsu et al., 1985) and rhesus monkey myometrium (Kramer et al., 1990), human endometrium (Chen et al., 1988; Fei et al., 1990), rat anterior pituitary cell (Cronin et al., 1987) and human monocytic cell line (THP-1) monocytes (Parsell et al., 1996). The increases in cAMP are important components in relaxin-induced myometrial inhibition in the rat (Dodge et al., 1999) and decidualization of human endometrial stromal cells (Huang et al., 1987; Tabanelli et al., 1992). Although relaxin stimulationis clearly linked to increased cAMP in many tissues it is not clear exactly how relaxin activates adenylate cyclase. There seems to be at least some G-protein component of this increase in cAMP, consistent with the relaxin receptor RXFP1 being a GPCR (Hsu et al., 2002). cAMP elevation in THP-1 and human endometrial stromal cells can be blocked by inhibitors of tyrosine kinase or mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) (Bartsch et al., 2001) and relaxin appears to activate MAPK in these cells (Zhang et al., 2002) although the activation is sporadic and can be inhibited by blocking PKA suggesting that it is a downstream event that follows elevation of intracellular cAMP (Ivell et al., personal communication). One suggestion from experiments in human endothelial stromal cells is that relaxin stimulation leads to the inhibition of a cell-specific phosphodiesterase (PDE) to induce sustained increases in cAMP (Bartsch et al., 2004). In THP-1 cells, the findings are equivocal with some studies indicating that the increase in cAMP is associated with PDE inhibition (Ivell et al., 2005) and others showing that blockade of PDE by general inhibitor isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX) or the PDE8 inhibitor diphyridamole fails to alter the cAMP response to relaxin (Nguyen et al., 2003). In HEK293 cells expressing RXFP1 and a secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) reporter gene containing a cAMP response element, relaxin caused a marked response commensurate with an increase in intracellular cAMP (Halls et al., 2005a, 2006). In THP-1 cells or HEK293T cells expressing RXFP1 receptors cAMP responses to relaxin during the first 5 min of stimulation were not sensitive to phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3-K) inhibition whereas responses to longer periods of stimulation were inhibited by wortmannin or LY294002 (Fig. 4) (Nguyen et al., 2003; Halls et al., 2005c, 2006). In HEK293 cells it was of interest that the PI3-K inhibitor sensitive component of the response was abolished by pretreatment of cells with pertussis toxin (PTX) suggesting that PI3-K activation in HEK293 cells expressing RXFP1 may be via βγ subunits derived from Gi (Fig. 4) (Halls et al., 2005c, 2006). PTX sensitivity was not a feature of the responses in THP-1 cells, suggesting that if activation of PI3-K is by βγ subunits

then they may be derived from G-proteins other than Gi in THP-1 cells (Nguyen et al., 2003). There is now (Nguyen & Dessauer, 2005) evidence that PKCζ is the next step in PI3-K mediated increases in cAMP production since inhibition of PKC with chelerythrine reduced and activation with sphingomyelinase increased cAMP response to relaxin. Relaxin stimulated translocation of PKCζ to the cell membrane in a number of cell lines, an effect that was inhibited by PKCζ antisense oligonucleotide treatment that reduced PKCζ mRNA and protein levels. The antisense oligonucleotide also reduced the relaxin-induced increase in cAMP levels and the remaining response was insensitive to blockade by PI3-K inhibitors (Nguyen & Dessauer, 2005). The cAMP response to activation of RXFP1 receptors is clearly complex and can depend to some extent on the cell type and conditions of study (Halls et al., 2006; Fig. 5).

The positive inotropic and chronotropic effects of relaxin are also equivocal. Rabbit sinoatrial node cells respond to relaxin and the effects are consistent with increases in intracellular cAMP and activation of cAMP dependent protein kinase (Han et al., 1994). Relaxin also stimulates the secretion of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) from isolated perfused rat hearts (Toth et al., 1996). These effects were mediated through PKC, although treatment with a cAMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor also blocked ANP secretion as well as the chronotropic response, suggesting an involvement of cAMP. Measurement of cAMP levels in atria which are likely to reflect the inotropic response demonstrate only weak coupling to cAMP (Kompa et al., 2002). It is feasible that the chronotropic response of the few pacemaker cells in the SA node is mediated by cAMP whereas the increased force of contraction of atrial myocytes utilises another mechanism.

### 3.4.2. Mitogen-activated protein kinase activation in response to RXFP1 stimulation

The complexity of the relaxin response is emphasised by the action of relaxin in other cell types where it is not associated with increases in cAMP but may still involve some component

Fig. 5. Potential signalling pathways utilised by the RXFP1 receptor in a variety of cell types. The RXFP1 receptor can couple to adenylate cyclase (AC) via Gs and also couples to PTX sensitive G-proteins. G-protein βγ subunits then activate PI3-K that in turn activates PKCζ (Halls et al., 2006) which can translocate to the cell membrane (Nguyen & Dessauer, 2005) to stimulate adenylate cyclase (AC V/VI) and enhance cAMP production. The effect of βγ subunits can be blocked by co-expression of β-adrenergic receptor kinase c-terminus (β-ARK-ct) which acts as a βγ scavenger or by the inhibitors of PI3-K, wortmannin and LY294002. In some cells PI3-K may also switch on the protein kinase B (PKB/Akt) pathway to increase activation of NOSIII. cAMP will activate PKA which can phosphorylate many signalling proteins but also enhance gene transcription of NOSII. Transactivation of tyrosine kinase receptors such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) by AG1478 can also activate PI3-K that will switch on the P42/P44 (Erk1/2) MAPK pathway. There is also evidence that relaxin can directly activate nuclear GR. Note that it is highly likely that the relative importance of the various mechanisms indicated will vary with the cell type in which the receptor is expressed (modified from Bathgate et al., 2006a).

of G-protein coupled signalling. In rat ventricular fibroblasts relaxin causes only a weak transient increase in cAMP (Samuel et al., 2004a) and studies in human lower uterine segment fibroblasts showed no increase in cAMP but do show MAPK activation (Palejwala et al., 1998, 2001). Thus, in fibroblasts, cAMP does not appear to be the predominant signalling mechanism but may be linked to MAPK signalling which exerts the biological response.

Relaxin also activates extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk)1/2 in a variety of cells known to express RXFP1 receptors (Zhang et al., 2002). In human endothelial stromal cells, THP-1 cells and in primary cultures of human coronary artery and pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells addition of H2 relaxin produced rapid (<5 min) phosphorylation of Erk1/2 with no change in levels of total Erk and the effect was blocked by inhibition of MEK (Zhang et al., 2002) (Fig. 5). No evidence was obtained for activation of Akt or JNK in these cells by relaxin. The transcription factor CREB was also activated by relaxin in endothelial stromal cells but whether this results from the Erk1/2 cascade or cAMP/PKA pathway is not clear at present (Zhang et al., 2002). Erk1/2 activation by relaxin has also been demonstrated in HeLa cells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells although the much longer time course of the effect (45–90 min) suggests that this may not be the result of a direct interaction with relaxin receptors (Dschietzig et al., 2003).

### 3.4.3. Interaction between relaxin and nitric oxide signalling

There is also considerable evidence that relaxin can act on cells both acutely and chronically by increasing the expression and/or activity of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) (Nistri & Bani, 2003). Two mechanisms have been suggested: activation of NOSIII by a GPCR mechanism and induction of NOSII mediated by cAMP (Fig. 5). Activation of NOSIII by relaxin has been suggested to involve stimulation of RXFP1, interaction of G-protein βγ subunits with PI3-K followed by activation of Akt and subsequently NOSIII by phosphorylation at Ser1179. Increased expression of NOSII would likely involve the increase in cAMP levels, activation of PKA, phosphorylation and inactivation of IκB thus promoting increased NOSII expression via NF-κB (Nistri & Bani, 2003). Recent studies also suggest that renal vasodilation in response to relaxin involves endothelin receptors. This mechanism involves upregulation of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 2 activity by relaxin, followed by increased processing of big ET to yield bioactive ET₁₋₃₂ leading via ETB receptors to activation of NOSIII and increased synthesis of nitric oxide (NO) (Fig. 6) (Conrad & Novak, 2004).

C.S. Samuel et al. / Pharmacology & Therapeutics 112 (2006) 529–552

Fig. 6. Interaction between relaxin and endothelin. High circulating relaxin levels in pregnancy interact with the RXFP1 receptor to cause increased expression of MMP2 that acts on big ET-1 to produce ET<sub>1-32</sub> to act on the ET<sub>B</sub> receptor. Activation of the ET<sub>B</sub> receptor switches on guanylate cyclase to generate increased production of NO to cause vasodilation (Conrad & Novak, 2004). The mechanism involved in the relaxin-mediated increase in expression of MMP2 may involve activation of PKCζ that is known to occur following RXFP1 stimulation.

### 3.4.4. Relaxin and glucocorticoid signalling

Relaxin has also been reported to interact with the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). Treatment with relaxin reduces the production of inflammatory cytokines by human macrophages in response to endotoxin (Dschietzig et al., 2004) and the effect is blocked by the GR antagonist RU486. Relaxin enters intact cells and is concentrated in the nucleus where it induces GR activation, nuclear translocation and DNA binding (Fig. 5). The mechanism of entry is unknown but probably does not involve internalisation of relaxin bound to RXFP1 since the receptor does not appear to internalise (Bathgate, unpublished observations). Relaxin may therefore internalise by endocytosis or it may be a cell-penetrating peptide (Langel, 2002). On entering the cell relaxin appears to act as a GR agonist and competes with GR agonists for binding to the GR. Since relaxins modified to have no action at the RXFP1 receptor retain activity at GR, the effects appear to be mediated independently of an action at RXFP1.

### 3.5. Regulation of relaxin-family peptide receptors

Very few studies have been conducted to examine the regulation of RXFP receptors. Most information is available for RXFP1 and has mostly been obtained in studies not specifically designed to examine receptor regulation. Thus, in a study of relaxin receptor signalling in a rat model of cardiac failure, it was shown that RXFP1 mRNA was decreased and this corresponded with a reduced response to relaxin in animals in failure (Kompa et al., 2002). In male rats, treatment with 17-β-oestradiol decreases the number of [³³P] H2 relaxin binding sites in atria and cerebral cortex whereas the same treatment in female rats had no effect in these tissues but increased the number of binding sites in uterine myometrium (Osheroff et al., 1992; Tan et al., 1999). More recently studies in human endometrium have shown marked increases in [³³P] H2 relaxin binding and RXFP1 mRNA expression in the secretory phase of the menstrual cycle although the agent responsible for the changes was not identified (Bond et al., 2004).

### 4. Relaxin as a hormone relevant to the cardiovascular system

#### 4.1. The heart as a target organ for relaxin

Since the discovery of high-affinity binding sites for H2 relaxin in the cardiac atria of male and female rats (Osheroff et al., 1992; Osheroff & Ho, 1993; Tan et al., 1999) as early as 1 day after birth, many subsequent studies have demonstrated that the heart and vessels are target organs for relaxin. Relaxin receptor density in the atria (*B*<sub>max</sub>, 5.9 fmol/mg protein) is higher than that in the uterine myometrium (*B*<sub>max</sub>, 2.9 fmol/mg protein) (Tan et al., 1999) and these receptors were primarily localized to atrial cardiomyocytes (Osheroff, 1995). The affinity of H2 relaxin binding to the atria (*pK*<sub>D</sub> 8.92) was similar to that in the cerebral cortex (*pK*<sub>D</sub> 8.79) and uterus (*pK*<sub>D</sub> 8.79) (Tan et al., 1999) suggesting that the same receptor is involved in all 3 tissues. In addition, the administration of estrogen to female rats had no effect on relaxin receptor density in the atria, but increased relaxin receptor numbers in the uterus (Tan et al., 1999) suggesting that any relaxin-induced effects on the heart are not mediated by estrogen in females. The binding studies also suggest that relaxin receptors are primarily found in the atria rather than the ventricles (Osheroff et al., 1992; Osheroff & Ho, 1993; Tan et al., 1999). However, more recent studies have established that RXFP1 receptor mRNA expression occurs in the atria and/or ventricles of rats (Hsu et al., 2002; Kompa et al., 2002; Samuel et al., 2004a), mice (Bathgate et al., 2002) and humans (Hsu et al., 2002). More specifically, RXFP1 receptor transcripts were identified in atrial and ventricular myocytes and fibroblasts, but not in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC)

(Samuel et al., 2004a). While the physiological significance of RXFP1 gene transcripts in the ventricles has yet to be fully elucidated, it has been demonstrated that the high density of relaxin receptors in the atria are involved in the inotropic and chronotropic responses to relaxin (Kompa et al., 2002; see Section 5.1).

### 4.2. Production of relaxin peptides in the cardiovascular system

A full understanding of the role of relaxin in the cardiovascular system has been hindered by lack of evidence for a locally synthesised ligand, particularly in the normal/unchallenged heart. Although recent studies identified relaxin gene transcripts in the mammalian heart (Fig. 7), these are only detected by reverse transcription (RT)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR), suggesting that expression levels are extremely low. In human atria and ventricles both H1 and H2 relaxin, but not H3 relaxin, are constitutively expressed, and are significantly elevated in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) (Dschietzig et al., 2001b) (Fig. 7). H1 and H2 relaxin mRNA was also identified in mammary arteries and saphenous veins

and were thought to be produced by myocytes and interstitial cells from the hearts of CHF patients (Dschietzig et al., 2001b). Confirmation of relaxin synthesis in the human heart was provided by Western blot analysis of heart tissue showing an 18-kDa prorelaxin band (Dschietzig et al., 2001b), whereas the mature 6-kDa relaxin was undetectable. Relaxin (Bathgate et al., 2002; Du et al., 2003) and relaxin-3 (Bathgate et al., 2002) mRNA expression have also been detected in the mouse atria and ventricles by RT-PCR. In the rat however, only relaxin-3 gene transcripts have been identified in the atria and ventricles, specifically in myocytes, fibroblasts and VSMC (Kompa et al., 2002; Samuel et al., 2004a) (Fig. 7). While an earlier study also demonstrated immunoreactive relaxin levels in rat atrial cardiomyocytes (Taylor & Clark, 1994), it was not clear if the antibody used was able to distinguish between relaxin and relaxin-3 or between the mature and pro-forms of relaxin. Additionally, an alternatively spliced 101 base-pair (relaxin) PCR product has been identified in blood vessels of the rat (Gunnersen et al., 1995). These findings demonstrate that the heart is a potential source of relaxin, and also a target organ for relaxin with a high density of relaxin receptors, particularly in the atria.

4.3. Alterations of relaxin and its primary receptor, RXFP1, in heart disease

A number of recent studies suggest that while the expression of relaxin is low or undetectable in the normal heart, relaxin plays a prominent role in the diseased heart. Relaxin may act as a novel compensatory hormone in humans, since the circulating and myocardial expression of H1 and H2 relaxin is significantly elevated in patients with CHF (Armbruster et al., 2001; Dschietzig et al., 2001b) due to ischemic or dilated cardiomyopathy (Fig. 7). The increase in plasma relaxin concentrations and myocardial expression of H1 and H2 relaxin in patients with CHF showed a positive correlation with the severity of disease (Dschietzig et al., 2001b), while vasodilatory therapy with hemodynamic improvements caused a decline in circulating relaxin. However, other studies have either failed to demonstrate elevated circulating relaxin in patients with CHF (Kupari et al., 2005) or a link between circulating relaxin levels and prognosis (Fisher et al., 2003), questioning whether relaxin could consistently be used to predict prognosis in patients with CHF. In separate studies, there was an inverse correlation between tissue levels of relaxin and the powerful vasoconstrictor, endothelin-1 (ET-1) (Dschietzig et al., 2001b, 2003), confirming the vasodilatory actions of relaxin. A potential finding of interest emanating from these studies was the detection of relaxin in the circulation of male patients.

Consistent with findings in humans, we have demonstrated that the mouse relaxin gene is significantly upregulated in a model of pressure overload-induced myocardial hypertrophy, caused by constriction of the thoracic aorta (Samuel & Du, unpublished data). Interestingly, following the discovery of H3 relaxin (and its rodent equivalent, relaxin-3) (Bathgate et al., 2002), we have been unable to detect relaxin gene transcripts in the rat heart (Kompa et al., 2002; Samuel et al., 2004a), in contrast to earlier studies that identified low levels of relaxin mRNA in the rat myocardium (Gunnersen et al., 1995; Dschietzig et al., 2001b). This may have been caused by the different primers being used to detect rat relaxin mRNA in each study, having different efficiencies in amplifying the cDNA products. On the other hand, relaxin-3 gene expression was consistently identified in atrial and ventricular myocytes (Kompa et al., 2002; Samuel et al., 2004a), fibroblasts, and VSMC by RT-PCR (Samuel et al., 2004a), suggesting that relaxin-3 is the predominant form of relaxin in the rat cardiovascular system. In accord with studies in the human and mouse, relaxin-3 was upregulated primarily in the atria in a rat model of CHF induced by myocardial infarction (MI) (Kompa et al., 2002). In addition increased left ventricular end diastolic pressure (5–25 mm Hg) in rats also increased relaxin mRNA levels in both the atrium and ventricle (Dschietzig et al., 2001b). Thus, the overall indications are that the relaxins are markedly upregulated in the diseased heart under pathological conditions although the relaxin concerned may vary with species.

In contrast to the several studies that examined altered relaxin expression in the normal and diseased heart, little is known about RXFP1 expression in the human and rodent heart,

under pathological conditions. RXFP1 mRNA levels were decreased in both the atria and left ventricles (LV) in the rat MI model (Kompa et al., 2002). However, it is yet to be established whether the high circulating or tissue levels of relaxin in heart failure are associated with downregulation or internalisation of RXFP1 receptors.

5. The effects of relaxin in the cardiovascular system

5.1. Chronotropic and inotropic actions on the heart

The heart is clearly a target organ for relaxin in rodents. As described above, the atria of male and female rats possess high affinity binding sites for relaxin (Osheroff et al., 1992; Osheroff & Ho, 1993; Tan et al., 1999) and RXFP1 mRNA has been detected in the rat (Hsu et al., 2000; Kompa et al., 2002), mouse (Krajnc-Franken et al., 2004), and human (Hsu et al., 2002) heart. Numerous in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrate that relaxin has potent, direct and concentration-dependent chronotropic and inotropic effects on the rat heart. The positive chronotropic effects of relaxin have been reported in perfused intact hearts (Thomas & Vandlen, 1993; Bani Sacchi et al., 1995; Coulson et al., 1996; Toth et al., 1996) and isolated right atria (Kakouris et al., 1992; Ward et al., 1992; Wade et al., 1994; Tan et al., 1998; Mathieu et al., 2001) and inotropic effects in left atria (Kakouris et al., 1992; Ward et al., 1992; Wade et al., 1994; Tan et al., 1998; Mathieu et al., 2001). The chronotropic effects are accompanied by the secretion of ANP in isolated perfused rat hearts (Toth et al., 1996). In rat atrial myocytes relaxin inhibits outward potassium currents, increases action potential duration, and enhances Ca²⁺ entry (Piedras-Renteria et al., 1997a, 1997b). In rabbit sinoatrial node cells, relaxin increased the rate of action potentials and L-type Ca²⁺ current (Han et al., 1994) by a PKA dependent mechanism. However relaxin has only a minor effect on cAMP levels in rat atria (Kompa et al., 2002) perhaps related to the known ability of the RXFP1 receptor to activate both Gs and Gi (Fig. 4). These actions of relaxin on the heart are largely confined to rodents and the hormone has no positive inotropic effect in the atria of sheep (Bathgate et al., 2001) or humans (Summers & Castro, unpublished observations). In accord with these findings radiolabelled relaxin does not bind specifically to sheep or human atria (Tan & Summers, unpublished observations).

5.2. Hemodynamic regulation

In many, but not all species, the circulating levels of relaxin increase during the late stages of pregnancy (Sherwood et al., 1984; Sherwood, 2004) where it is generally agreed that relaxin plays a pivotal role in the compensatory regulation of circulation and blood volume via actions on the kidney, vasculature and central nervous system. It has been speculated that there is an association between inadequate relaxin levels or actions and pregnancy-related hypertension and preeclampsia (Kristiansson & Wang, 2001; Davison et al., 2004).

The renal vasodilatory properties of relaxin have been thoroughly studied (Danielson et al., 1999; Conrad & Novak,

2004). Whilst in vitro studies show that relaxin dilates small and larger arteries in reproductive as well as non-reproductive organs including kidney, heart, liver and gut (Bani Sacchi et al., 1995; Di Bello et al., 1995; Novak et al., 2002), chronic administration of relaxin to rodents causes vasodilatation of small renal arteries resulting in a significant reduction in effective renal vascular resistance and increased glomerular filtration rate and effective renal plasma flow (Fig. 8) (Danielson et al., 1999; Novak et al., 2002; Danielson & Conrad, 2003). Relaxin also attenuates the vasoconstriction in response to ET-1, angiotensin II (Ang II) and catecholamines (Massicotte et al., 1989; Danielson et al., 1999; Skott & Carter, 2002; Dschietzig et al., 2003). However, it has yet to be determined whether relaxin indirectly or directly regulates both sodium and water retention by the kidney during pregnancy. In healthy men, hemodynamic disturbances produced by volume overload or the tilt test significantly increased the renal secretion of relaxin suggesting that it has a role in the maintenance of circulatory homeostasis (Heringlake et al., 2004). Exercise per se did not alter the circulating levels of relaxin (Kruger et al., 2004).

Although earlier studies failed to show hemodynamic effects of relaxin in pregnant or non-pregnant animals (Ahokas et al., 1989; Ward et al., 1991), more recent studies suggest that relaxin induces vasodilatation through activation of NOS (Bani Sacchi et al., 1995; Bani et al., 1998a; Failli et al., 2002). In

cultured VSMC, relaxin (1 nM–1 μM) concentration-dependently increased expression and activity of NOSII thus causing increases in cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), reduced intracellular Ca²⁺ levels, and VSMC relaxation (Bani et al., 1998a). However relaxin has little effect on NOSIII expression (Failli et al., 2002) although vasodilation of coronary arteries occurs following acute exposure to relaxin (1–10 nM) in perfused rat (Bani et al., 1998b) or guinea-pig hearts (Di Bello et al., 1995; Masini et al., 1997). This action is blocked by NOS inhibitors, suggesting an NO-dependent mechanism.

Several studies suggest that the action of relaxin may involve upregulation and activation of ETB receptors (Conrad et al., 1999; Danielson et al., 2000; Dschietzig et al., 2003). In vascular endothelial cells or VSMC it was suggested that relaxin upregulates expression of ETB receptors (Dschietzig et al., 2003), although others failed to see a change in ETB receptor expression in cultured vascular endothelial cells (Fig. 6) (Conrad, 2004). However, an obligatory role for the ETB receptors in mediating vasodilation of small renal arteries in response to relaxin was indicated by the absence of this effect in ETB receptor deficient rats (Jeyabalan et al., 2003). Interestingly the vasodilatory effect of relaxin was blocked by MMP inhibitors (Jeyabalan et al., 2003). It was proposed (Conrad & Novak, 2004) that in vascular endothelial cells, relaxin upregulates MMP activity that is responsible for cleavage of big ET-1 to ET₁₋₃₂. Activation of ETB subsequently leads to enhanced NOS activity with an increase in NO generation (Jeyabalan et al., 2003; Conrad & Novak, 2004). Thus, the upregulation of MMP, an action of relaxin previously regarded as important for matrix remodeling, also plays a pivotal role in mediating the vasodilatory effect of the peptide (Fig. 6).

There is also evidence to demonstrate that chronic relaxin alters arterial mechanical properties. Global arterial compliance was determined in conscious rats by simultaneous measurement of flow and by the diastolic decay of aortic pulsatile pressure. Ten-day treatment with relaxin significantly reduced peripheral vascular resistance and increased arterial compliance and cardiac output in vivo, while increasing the passive compliance of small renal arteries in vitro (Conrad et al., 2004). These effects occurred in the absence of a significant change in mean arterial pressure.

In rat models of hypertensive disease, such as spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension (Tozzi et al., 2005), relaxin treatment significantly reduces vascular resistance. In SHR, the vasodilatory effect is seen in blood vessels in vitro (Dschietzig et al., 2005; Failli et al., 2005) and is associated with reduced blood pressure (St Louis & Massicotte, 1985) or increased cardiac output and global arterial compliance in vivo (Deborah et al., 2005). Pre-treatment of SHR mesenteric arteries with relaxin also significantly blunted the vasoconstriction in response to arginine vasopressin or norepinephrine (Massicotte et al., 1989). In the pulmonary hypertensive model, treatment with relaxin (0.05 and 0.24 mg/kg/day for 10 days) reduced right ventricular pressure and, at the higher dose, lowered collagen content in pulmonary arterial walls (Tozzi et al., 2005).

In addition to these direct vasodilatory and vascular remodeling actions, blood volume is regulated by relaxin via a centrally mediated mechanism to regulate water intake (Sinnayah et al., 1999; Hornsby et al., 2001; Sunn et al., 2002) as well as by regulation of renal function (Dschietzig & Stangl, 2003; Conrad, 2004). These effects are particularly important for the transition of the circulation from the nonpregnant to the pregnant condition during early pregnancy and potentially important in the maintenance of homeostasis during late pregnancy. In the rat, intracerebroventricular injection of relaxin stimulates water intake (Sinnayah et al., 1999; Hornsby et al., 2001). This action is blocked by the angiotensin receptor (AT₁) antagonist losartan, suggesting that relaxin activates the central Ang II/AT₁ system (Sinnayah et al., 1999). This action is also associated with upregulation of Fos in the subfornical organ suggesting that this area of the brain is a site of action of relaxin (Sunn et al., 2002). Centrally administered relaxin also exerts hemodynamic actions with increases in blood pressure and heart rate (Yang et al., 1995; Parry et al., 1998). This blood pressure response to relaxin involves the central release of oxytocin and vasopressin (Parry et al., 1998; Sunn et al., 2002).

Thus, relaxin regulates circulatory homeostasis through several mechanisms: firstly, it reduces vascular tone potentially by enhancing NO-dependent relaxation thereby antagonizing the effect of several vasoconstrictors; secondly, it controls the balance of blood volume through its central actions on water intake and actions on the kidney; thirdly, relaxin is able to remodel the vasculature and this action is particularly important in diseases such as hypertension.

### 5.3. Regulation of myocardial hypertrophy

In heart disease, there is evidence for an upregulation of the relaxin system in the myocardium (Dschietzig et al., 2001a; Kompa et al., 2002; Fisher et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 2005) (authors’ unpublished data). A significant correlation between the levels of both tissue and circulating relaxin (Dschietzig et al., 2001b) or relaxin-3 levels (Zhang et al., 2005) and the severity of cardiac dysfunction has been documented both clinically and experimentally. In some patients with cardiomyopathy and CHF, the circulating level of H2 relaxin is increased 5–8 folds and shows a positive correlation with the severity of heart failure (Dschietzig et al., 2001b) although the physiological significance of the increase remains unclear. In relaxin KO mice, there was no significant change in cardiac weight between aged KO and wildtype mice of the same gender (Du et al., 2003), suggesting that an absence of endogenous relaxin per se does not cause hypertrophy in the mouse. However, in mice with constriction of the transverse aorta for 7 weeks, there was a 70% increase in the left ventricular weight, and a 3-fold increase in relaxin expression in the hypertrophied LV (Samuel & Du, unpublished data). In SHR there is a significant elevation of relaxin mRNA and protein expression in the heart (Dschietzig et al., 2005). A strong negative correlation was observed in cardiac tissues (from 12-month-old SHR) between relaxin protein and organ weight normalized by control values as the hypertrophy index (Dschietzig et al., 2005). In a recent study, treatment of 9-to 10-month-old SHR with relaxin (0.5 mg/kg/day for 14 days) (Lekgabe et al., 2005) failed to alter LV weight, myocyte size and expression of hypertrophy-related genes such as ANP. However, the mild hypertrophy in SHR at this age might limit the chance of any inhibitory effect. However, there is as yet no direct evidence for an action of relaxin in regulating cardiac hypertrophy, nor does relaxin treatment change myocardial hypertrophy.

Based on the known actions of relaxin on the heart, it has the potential to influence hypertrophic growth. Relaxin stimulates synthesis and release of ANP in the heart (Toth et al., 1996; Dschietzig et al., 2005). In the perfused rat heart, an increase of mechanical load is associated with upregulation of relaxin (Dschietzig et al., 2001b). Stimulation of natriuretic peptide receptor-A (NPR-A) through ANP activates guanylyl cyclase causing cGMP accumulation and activation of PKG (Takimoto et al., 2005). Recent studies have shown that disruption of pro-ANP (Franco et al., 2004), pro-ANP convertase corin (Chan et al., 2005) or NPR-A (Kishimoto et al., 2001) all lead to a hypertrophic phenotype. Conversely, activation of PKG strongly inhibits hypertrophic signalling in mice with pressure-overload (Takimoto et al., 2005). There is also strong evidence that relaxin inhibits the activation, proliferation and function of cardiac fibroblasts (see Section 5.6). Interestingly, in vitro studies have provided evidence that activated fibroblasts contribute to the development of hypertrophy by secreting a number of factors such as growth factors and cytokines that are known to be pro-hypertrophic, including Ang II, transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), interleukin (IL)-6 (Harada et al., 1997; Ancey et al., 2002; Fredj et al., 2005a, 2005b). Studies on fibroblasts also consistently show that relaxin antagonises the actions of ET-1, insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-1) and Ang II (Samuel et al., 2004a) all of which are known to be important mediators of hypertrophic signalling (Yamazaki et al., 1998).

Based on these considerations, the effect of relaxin on hypertrophy has been examined using cultured neonatal rat cardiac myocytes (NRCM). Relaxin (16.7 nM) had no effect on hypertrophy in response to phenylephrine (50 μM). However, NRCM hypertrophy induced by fibroblast-conditioned medium was significantly inhibited by relaxin (Moore and Du, unpublished observations). In this study, relaxin also suppressed the expression of α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and Akt phosphorylation in cultured fibroblasts. Thus, further studies are required to extend these in vitro observations into in vivo models, including relaxin KO mice.

### 5.4. Myocardial protection

There is evidence that relaxin possesses cardiac protective actions in myocardial ischemia and anaphylaxis. In in vivo models of ischemia/reperfusion (Bani et al., 1998b; Perna et al., 2005), it has been shown that acute administration of relaxin to rats (0.3–0.4 μg/kg i.v.) or pigs (1.25–5 μg/kg i.v.) significantly reduced myocardial injury, as determined by reduced leakage of myocyte-specific enzymes or proteins, accumulation of peroxidative products, intracellular Ca²⁺ overload, and morphological abnormalities (Bani et al., 1998b; Perna et al., 2005).

Ischemic myocardium also showed less accumulation of blood-derived inflammatory cells in the presence of relaxin (Bani et al., 1998b; Perna et al., 2005). In the rat study, there appeared to be a reduced severity of arrhythmias and better survival following the ischemia/reperfusion procedure (Bani et al., 1998b). Relaxin treatment caused a reduction of infarct size in 2 studies as well as a reduction in myocyte and endothelial cell apoptosis in pigs (Bani et al., 1998b; Perna et al., 2005). Interestingly, the anti-apoptotic action of relaxin was also seen in reproductive tissues (Zhao et al., 2001; Samuel et al., 2003a). In a model utilising isoproterenol-induced cardiac injury, it was reported that treatment with relaxin-3 (0.2 and 2 μg/kg/day) for 10 days reduced release of intra-myocyte enzymes, lowered plasma level of ET, cardiac content of malondialdehyde (MDA), regional inflammatory cell infiltration and fibrosis (Zhang et al., 2005). These effects of relaxin, seen in rodent or pig models in vivo, resulted in a better preservation of cardiac function (Perna et al., 2005; Zhang et al., 2005).

The mechanisms involved in the protective effects of relaxin are likely to include preservation of coronary vascular integrity, antioxidant actions, and the prevention of inflammatory neutrophil accumulation and subsequent release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. In an earlier study in perfused guinea-pig hearts, administration of relaxin (20 ng/mL) to the perfusate provided cardiac protection (Masini et al., 1997). Thus, direct protection and antagonism of blood-derived factors, such as inflammatory cells, are involved in cardiac protection produced by relaxin. There is also evidence for actions of relaxin on platelet aggregation (Bani et al., 1995), neutrophil activation and adhesion to vascular endothelial cells (Nistri et al., 2003; Masini et al., 2004), together with activation of NOS and increased NO production by coronary vessels (Bani Sacchi et al., 1995; Conrad, 2004). Relaxin also stabilises mast cells (Masini et al., 1994; Masini et al., 2002), and reduces release of factors such as histamine, leukotrienes, prostanoids, cytokines, chemokines as well as proteases (Krishnaswamy et al., 2005). These mast cell-derived mediators contribute to ischemia/reperfusion injury in cardiac or skeletal muscles (Gilles et al., 2003; Bortolotto et al., 2004; Abonia et al., 2005).

In summary, these studies provide evidence that relaxin protects against ischemia/reperfusion injury. The mechanisms responsible include antagonism of inflammation, cell death, oxidative stress and calcium overload. However, the molecular mechanisms that underpin these effects are largely undefined. Our recent findings in cultured cardiomyocytes show that apoptosis due to H₂O₂-mediated oxidative stress was markedly prevented by pre-treatment with nanomolar concentrations of relaxin. This protective action was associated with elevated ratio of Bcl2/Bax and Akt, a molecule down-stream of PI3-K known to possess anti-apoptotic actions (authors’ unpublished data). Further studies are essential to investigate the role of the elevated levels of relaxin in cardiomyopathy (Dschietzig et al., 2001b), SHR (Dschietzig et al., 2005), catecholamine-mediated cardiomyopathy (Zhang et al., 2005) as well as pressure-overload induced hypertrophy (authors’ unpublished data).
5.5. Post-infarct healing and myocardial regeneration

Current concepts underlying the cell therapy of heart disease have been derived using myocardial infarct models that are associated with fibrosis in the infarcted area. Injury to the human heart is followed by healing which predominantly occurs by scar formation, whereas in other species such as zebrafish (Raya et al., 2004) or MRL mice (Leferovich et al., 2001), regeneration is predominant and fibrosis is suppressed. In MRL mice, complete healing in the ear hole wound model is associated with higher levels of regional MMP (Gourevitch et al., 2003). There is also evidence that cell therapy reduces the amount of scar formation to some extent (Kudo et al., 2003). Several studies show a low survival rate (<10%) of implanted stem cells after introduction into the normal or infarcted myocardium (Muller-Ehmsen et al., 2002). In addition, the process of scar formation is associated with the end of the time-window allowing for stem cell homing and proliferation (Lu et al., 2004). An additional issue is stem cell integration since it is generally agreed that scar tissue forms a barrier to the proper integration of implanted cells. Scar formation, a common consequence of myocardial infarction, thus may be an important factor in preventing reparative growth of the myocardium. Thus modulation of the fibrotic response of host tissue in conjunction with cell implantation has the potential to produce significant benefits in the field of cell therapy, and is we believe an area worthy of further study.

The well-documented antifibrotic action of relaxin suggests that by inhibiting the process of scar formation it might facilitate stem cell therapy. Relaxin has been shown to decrease fibrosis in several models. In a transgenic mouse displaying cardiac-specific over-expression of β₂-adrenoceptors there are pathological changes that resemble those observed in ischaemic cardiomyopathy (Gao et al., 2003) and isoproterenol-induced cardiomyopathy in the rat (Zhang et al., 2005). Collagen over-expression in β₂-adrenoceptor transgenic mice is reduced by relaxin administration as is cardiac fibrosis in isoproterenol-induced cardiomyopathy in the rat (Samuel et al., 2004a; Zhang et al., 2005). Other properties of relaxin may also contribute to the tissue regeneration effect. A recent study reported that addition of relaxin to skeletal myoblasts and adult cardiomyocytes in co-culture improved cell–cell integration (Formigli et al., 2005). A pro-angiogenic action of relaxin has been observed in non-cardiac tissues such as the endometrium or certain types of cancers, where relaxin promotes vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression causing either increased menstrual bleeding or tumor growth (Unemori et al., 1999; Palejwala et al., 2002; Silvertown et al., 2003). In ischaemic wound sites, relaxin can stimulate vasogenesis by the upregulation of VEGF and basic fibroblast growth factor (BFGF), and facilitate wound healing (Unemori et al., 2000). However in a study (Ryan et al., 2005) that monitored the expression of VEGF receptor 2 at a skin wound site using luciferase as a reporter gene there was no demonstrable effect of relaxin. A recent study has shown that following laceration injury of skeletal muscle, relaxin given regionally inhibited fibrosis and promoted muscle regeneration (Negishi et al., 2005). However, it remains to be determined whether the pro-healing actions of relaxin are dependent on the type of injury (e.g. ischemic or non-ischemic). A further possibility is that relaxin is able to enhance the expression and signalling of IGF-1 (Huang et al., 1992; Ohleth et al., 1997) that is well known to promote muscle regeneration (Musaro et al., 2004; Saetrum Opgaard & Wang, 2005). Future studies are warranted to test the potential role of relaxin treatment in promoting cardiac and skeletal muscle regeneration (Fig. 9).

5.6. Antifibrotic actions

The most consistently reported biological effect of relaxin is its ability to stimulate the breakdown of collagen, the predominant protein in most organs of the body (Samuel, 2005). The collagens are the major structural elements of tissues, and provide tensile properties and a scaffold for cell attachment and migration. After injury the heart undergoes remodelling, utilising processes such as myocyte hypertrophy, necrosis and proliferation and differentiation of ECM-producing fibroblasts, leading to increased ECM (and collagen) production and ultimately, interstitial fibrosis (cardiac scarring). Fibrosis is stimulated by a number of growth factors, cytokines and endogenous regulators, and is associated with stiffening of the arteries and increased ventricular chamber stiffness, leading to altered myocardial structure and cardiac dysfunction. There is increasing evidence that relaxin provides a rapid and potent means of inhibiting the onset of cardiac fibrosis and decreasing established myocardial scarring (Samuel et al., 2004a; Lekgabe et al., 2005). Furthermore, recent studies in the relaxin gene-KO (relaxin-KO) mouse suggest that relaxin is an important endogenous regulator of collagen turnover in the developing and ageing heart (Du et al., 2003) and in other organs (Samuel et al., 2003b, 2004b, 2005b).

Studies of the aging of relaxin-KO mice provide strong evidence that relaxin is an important, naturally occurring antifibrotic agent. Male relaxin-KO mice develop an age-related progression of cardiac fibrosis, characterised by increases in type I collagen mRNA expression (from 6 months of age), collagen content and collagen concentration (from 9 months of age) in the ventricles (Du et al., 2003). These mice also display atrial hypertrophy, left ventricular diastolic dysfunction and increased ventricular chamber stiffness, although their blood

![Figure 9](#fig9)

Fig. 9. Post-infarct healing of the heart is primarily by scar formation. This process occurs rapidly and inhibits potential myocardial regeneration. The fibrotic environment inhibits stem cell homing or migration, proliferation and differentiation, and coupling with native cardiomyocytes. Formation of mature scar tissue therefore makes cell therapy difficult. We hypothesise that the use of relaxin to inhibit or delay scar formation will promote myocardial regeneration.

pressure, cardiac contractile function and response to β-adrenoceptor stimulation remained unaltered (Du et al., 2003). Interestingly, these cardiac phenotypes were not observed in female relaxin-KO mice at ages of up to 2 years, which may result from (i) a male gender-restricted phenotype as reported in other gene-KO models (Du, 2004); (ii) the presence of androgens in males that enhance the progression of cardiac fibrosis (Gao et al., 2003); or (iii) the presence of female hormones or sex steroids that compensate for the absence of relaxin in female relaxin-KO mice. Fibrosis also occurs in the kidneys of male relaxin-KO mice (Samuel et al., 2004b), whilst in other organs such as the lung (Samuel et al., 2003b) and skin (Samuel et al., 2003a), fibrosis occurs in both males and females, with the onset and severity of disease being delayed in females. These findings suggest that endogenous relaxin protects the ageing heart and other organs from the development of fibrosis, and that its effects are differentially influenced in various organs by gender.

While the cardiac phenotypes of RXFP1 receptor-KO mice have yet to be established, these animals display many similarities to the relaxin-KO mouse with respect to collagen regulation. Both relaxin-KO (Zhao et al., 1999; Zhao et al., 2000) and RXFP1 receptor-KO (Kamat et al., 2004; Krajnc-Franken et al., 2004) mice display impaired nipple and mammary gland development (lactation) and to a lesser extent prolonged pregnancies and impaired ability to deliver their

pups, associated with increased collagen in the nipples and in several female reproductive organs. Male relaxin-KO (Samuel et al., 2003a) and RXFP1 receptor-KO mice (Krajnc-Franken et al., 2004) also display azoospermia and a reduction in fertility, associated with increased collagen in several male reproductive organs, while both KO display an age-related progression of pulmonary fibrosis (Samuel et al., 2003b; Kamat et al., 2004). These findings suggest that many of the antifibrotic or collagen-related actions of relaxin are mediated via the RXFP1 receptor, which will have important implications for future research targeting prevention and reversal of fibrosis, a hallmark of the diseased heart.

Relaxin not only causes collagen remodelling in several reproductive organs in preparation for parturition (Sherwood, 2004; Bathgate et al., 2006b), but also acts on non-reproductive cells and tissues to inhibit fibrosis at several levels (reviewed in (Bathgate et al., 2003; Samuel, 2005; Bathgate et al., 2006b). The administration of H2 relaxin alone (100 ng/mL) to neonatal rat cardiac fibroblasts had no effect on basal cell function or collagen expression (Samuel et al., 2004a). However, H2 relaxin treatment significantly inhibited TGF-β, Ang II or insulin growth factor I-stimulated cardiac fibroblast proliferation, differentiation, interstitial collagen synthesis and deposition (Fig. 10). This effect most likely involved MMP-2-induced collagen degradation since there was an increase in MMP-2 expression when H2 relaxin was applied to cells that were stimulated with the pro-fibrotic factors, Ang II or TGF-β (Fig. 10) (Samuel et al., 2004a). Additionally, the decrease in atrial and ventricular collagen may have been associated with a relaxin-induced decrease in the expression of the tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases (TIMP), which usually act to inhibit the activation of the MMP. While the effects of relaxin on TIMP expression from these cardiac cells is yet to be established, relaxin has been shown to inhibit TIMP expression when administered to other primary fibroblast cultures (Unemori & Amento, 1990). These findings (on cardiac fibroblasts) are consistent with studies on stimulated (but not normal) fibroblast cultures from other organs such as the skin

( Unemori & Amento, 1990 ), lung ( Unemori et al., 1996 ), liver ( Williams et al., 2001; Bennett et al., 2003 ) and kidney ( Masterson et al., 2004 ) in which H2 relaxin administration inhibited newly formed collagen synthesis and secretion, while increasing MMP-induced collagen degradation, causing decreased collagen deposition.

Relaxin has also inhibited or reversed fibrosis in every in vivo animal model of disease investigated to date ( Lekgabe et al., 2005; Samuel, 2005; Samuel et al., 2005a; Bathgate et al., 2006b ), although the effectiveness and potency varies with the organ and disease phase studied. Relaxin was shown to decrease left ventricular fibrosis in 3 models of fibrotic cardiomyopathy, associated with cardiac dysfunction and heart failure; caused by relaxin-deficiency ( Samuel et al., 2004a ), transgenic cardiac overexpression of β₂-adrenoceptors ( Samuel et al., 2004a ) or hypertension ( Lekgabe et al., 2005 ) ( Fig. 11 ). More recently, H3 relaxin has also been shown to have antifibrotic actions, and decreased cardiac fibrosis associated with an isoprotenerol-induced model of myocardial ischemic injury ( Zhang et al., 2005 ). These effects are likely mediated by RXFP1 as H3 relaxin increased MMP expression in RXFP1 expressing rat cardiac fibroblasts ( Bathgate et al., 2006c ). Consistent with its effects in other models of fibrosis ( Samuel, 2005; Samuel et al., 2005a; Bathgate et al., 2006b ), relaxin rapidly, selectively and almost completely reversed cardiac fibrosis, when given to SHR during the early onset of disease ( Lekgabe et al., 2005 ), but was less effective in relaxin-KO mice or β₂-adrenoceptor over-expressing mice in decreasing established scarring of the LV ( Samuel et al., 2004a ). An important observation in this study was that relaxin targeted the diseased myocardium (LV) and did not influence non-affected regions of the heart or other organs ( Lekgabe et al., 2005 ), consistent with in vitro studies ( Samuel et al., 2004a ) showing that relaxin does not affect basal collagen expression. These findings demonstrate that relaxin is a potent, rapidly acting and safe antifibrotic agent, that has important therapeutic potential for the treatment of cardiac disorders associated with fibrosis. Further work is required to determine the optimal dosage, timing and route of administration of

outcomes from these studies would clearly facilitate the transition of relaxin from experimental curiosity to novel antifibrotic therapy.

The cardiac protective action in ischemia/reperfusion injury has been documented in rodents and in pigs (summarised in Table 2). In these studies (Section 5.4), the cardiac protective effect was observed in several assays showing that relaxin was capable of preventing cell injury, inflammation, oxidative stress, apoptosis, calcium overload and ventricular dysfunction. These experimental findings clearly encourage the design of clinical trials testing the efficacy of relaxin in patients with ischemic heart attack.

Formation of scar tissue is closely associated with healing in the mammalian heart following myocardial infarction. In the recent years, it has been shown that under certain circumstances, the infarcted heart has a potential to regenerate, to some degree, functional cardiomyocytes (for review, see Laflamme & Murray, 2005; Leri et al., 2005). However there are several major challenges to such tissue regeneration, including the progressive loss of stem cells and inadequate electrical and functional synchronization of the newly developed native myocytes. An important factor that reduces the impact of tissue regeneration is fibrosis (Olson, 2004; Laflamme & Murray, 2005). Therefore, the known actions of relaxin to inhibit fibrosis and apoptosis, to facilitate angiogenesis, to activate the PI3-K pathway (known to be important in myocardial regeneration), and to regulate inflammation, may make a substantial contribution to myocardial regeneration (Fig. 9).

Although the upregulation of relaxin in heart disease is observed in both clinical and experimental studies (see Section 4.3), the implications of these changes are not clear. It also has to be established whether relaxin levels are altered in other disease conditions, such as hypertension and atherosclerosis. No studies have yet been carried out that examine whether changes in relaxin levels are associated with changes in relaxin receptor numbers in the diseased heart and vessels. Considering the established beneficial actions of relaxin in the cardiovascular system, the elevated circulating and organ levels of the peptide hormone could be significant or they might merely reflect an overall neurohormonal responses to disease. Determination of answers to these key questions will be vital for our understanding of the roles of relaxin in cardiovascular disease. The increasing availability of genetically manipulated mouse models will facilitate research in this area.

## Fig. 12. A summary of the antifibrotic actions of relaxin. The extent of fibrosis is determined by the balance between matrix synthesis and matrix degradation. It is well documented that relaxin stimulates matrix metalloproteinase-induced matrix degradation, while inhibiting expression of the tissue inhibitors of MMP (TIMP) and matrix synthesis to alter this balance and reverse the fibrotic process. It should be noted that the inhibitory actions of relaxin only occur in tissues/cells associated with an abnormal accumulation of matrix proteins/ collagen, but not in organs with normal collagen content.

relaxin to the diseased heart in different stages of fibrosis. It will also be important to know the regulation and activation of RXFP1 receptor upon ligand binding in diseased states and the signalling mechanisms by which relaxin exerts its antifibrotic actions in the cardiovascular system under pathological conditions before relaxin can successfully be used clinically.

## 6. The therapeutic potential of relaxin in heart disease and future research directions and perspectives

The antifibrotic action of relaxin has been well documented by studies in vitro and in vivo on non-cardiovascular organs and more recently on the heart (see Section 5.6). This action is characterized by the high potency of relaxin, a rapid action and an action confined to abnormal production of collagen. This complex pattern of activity of relaxin may reflect effects on several stages of collagen turnover (Fig. 12). Several recent studies have shown that administration of relaxin for a short period either prevented or reversed myocardial fibrosis in several models of cardiac fibrosis with different aetiologies. It would be of considerable interest to examine if these effects of relaxin could be reproduced in large animal models of cardiac fibrosis and more important in preliminary clinical trials. The

Currently, there is limited knowledge of the signalling mechanisms utilised by relaxin in the cardiovascular system. Although studies in in vitro cell systems have demonstrated that RXFP1 signalling is complex and involves numerous pathways it is yet to be established if the same mechanisms are utilised by cells in the cardiovascular system. It will also be important to build on studies that show interactions of relaxin with other hormones, such as ET-1, Ang II, and estrogen. Progress in this area would significantly advance our understanding of the physiological and potential therapeutic roles of relaxin.

Although there are an increasing number of reports on the cardiac actions of relaxin, the vascular effects of relaxin, particularly in diseased states, is largely unexplored. It is clear from experimental studies that relaxin exerts a significant influence on vascular function via NOS, and by interacting with other peptides such as ET-1 and Ang II. Considering the inhibitory effects of relaxin on the inflammatory response as well as on matrix remodelling, it is likely that relaxin can influence the vasculature under conditions of hypertension or atherosclerosis, diseases that are associated with structural changes in the vessel wall, endothelial dysfunction and regional inflammation. Further studies are warranted to explore these possibilities.

Relaxin may also have a role in treating the increased cardiovascular risk associated with ageing in post-menopausal women. A decrease in the effects of estrogens has long been regarded as the responsible factor for the rise in cardiovascular events that occur following menopause. However, recent clinical trials have failed to document a cardiovascular protective action of hormone replacement therapy (Grady et al., 2002; Manson et al., 2003). One possible interpretation of these findings is that the decline in the levels of other hormones, including relaxin, after menopause might contribute to the increase in cardiovascular risk. Further research is required to address such a possibility.

The effects summarised in this review suggest that relaxin is a cardioprotective agent that is upregulated in response to cardiovascular disease and able to induce a number of effects, to inhibit inflammation and cardiac fibrosis and promote tissue maintenance and regeneration. Elucidation of the signalling mechanisms utilised by relaxin to induce its various effects and extension of the studies on animal models to human disease will be crucial to further establishing its clinical potential.
