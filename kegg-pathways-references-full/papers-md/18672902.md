ABSTRACT: BtrN is a radical SAM (S-adenosyl-L-methionine) enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of 2-deoxy-scyllo-inosamine (DOIA) into 3-amino-2,3-dideoxy-scyllo-inosose (amino-DOI) during the biosynthesis of 2-deoxystreptamine (DOS) in the butirosin producer *Bacillus circulans*. Recently, we have shown that BtrN catalyzes the transfer of a hydrogen atom at C-3 of DOIA to 5′-deoxyadenosine, and thus, the reaction was proposed to proceed through the hydrogen atom abstraction by the 5′-deoxyadenosyl radical. In this work, the BtrN reaction was analyzed by EPR spectroscopy. A sharp double triplet EPR signal was observed when the EPR spectrum of the enzyme reaction mixture was recorded at 50 K. The spin coupling with protons partially disappeared by reaction with [2,2-²H₂]DOIA, which unambiguously proved the observed signal to be a radical on C-3 of DOIA. On the other hand, the EPR spectrum of the [4Fe-4S] cluster of BtrN during the reaction showed a complex signal due to the presence of several species. Comparison of signals derived from a [4Fe-4S] center of BtrN incubated with various combinations of products (5′-deoxyadenosine, L-methionine, and amino-DOI) and substrates (SAM and DOIA) indicated that the EPR signals observed during the reaction were derived from free BtrN, a BtrN–SAM complex, and a BtrN–SAM–DOIA complex. Significant changes in the EPR signals upon binding of SAM and DOIA suggest the close interaction of both substrates with the [4Fe-4S] cluster.

Oxidations of alcohols into carbonyl compounds are abundant in biological systems and often serve a central role in metabolism. These oxidation reactions generally proceed through a hydride transfer mechanism by nicotinamide-dependent dehydrogenases (1–4), flavin-dependent enzymes (5, 6), and pyrroloquinoline quinone-dependent dehydrogenases (7, 8). Only a few enzymes are known to catalyze oxidations of hydroxy groups through radical mechanisms, such as certain types of P450 oxidoreductases (9–11) and galactose oxidase (12, 13), which utilize dioxygen as an electron acceptor. Recently, we have found that a radical SAM¹ (S-adenosyl-L-methionine) enzyme, BtrN, catalyzes anaerobic oxidation of a hydroxy group into a ketone, namely, conversion of 2-deoxy-scyllo-inosamine (DOIA) into 3-amino-2,3-dideoxy-scyllo-inosose (amino-DOI), during biosynthesis of the 2-deoxystreptamine part of butirosin (Scheme 1) (14). The reaction of BtrN is quite unique because this enzyme utilizes SAM as the sole oxidant and does not require any extra electron acceptors. Similar anaerobic dehydrogenations by radical SAM enzymes were also reported for anaerobic sulfatase maturing enzymes (anSME), which catalyze post-transcriptional modifications of sulfatases by oxidizing serine or cysteine residues of sulfatases into formylglycines (15, 16). Although BtrN and anSME show little amino acid sequence homology, they both catalyze anaerobic oxidation of a hydroxy group without the assistance of other enzymes or an outside electron acceptor other than SAM (14–16). Thus, they can be defined as “radical SAM dehydrogenases” (14).

So far, mechanistic studies on these radical SAM dehydrogenases are quite limited. Our previous report revealed that the BtrN reaction consumes a stoichiometric amount of SAM and generates the corresponding amount of 5′-deoxyadenosine, L-methionine, and amino-DOI. The observation of deuterium atom transfer from the C-3 position of DOIA to 5′-deoxyadenosine indicated that the reaction proceeds through hydrogen atom abstraction by the 5′-deoxyadenosyl radical, which would generate a DOIA radical intermediate. Requirement of only 1 equiv of SAM for the oxidation of DOIA suggests the conversion of the putative DOIA radical intermediate to amino-DOI needs another electron acceptor. Since the reaction is independent of any outside electron acceptors for multiple turnovers, as described above, the [4Fe-4S]²⁺ cluster of BtrN itself was proposed to accept the electron from the presumable DOIA radical

shifts are reported in δ values based on the solvent signal (D₂O δₕ = 4.65) as a reference. Dioxane (δc = 66.5) was used an internal standard for ¹³C NMR. UV−vis absorption spectra were recorded with a DU7400 spectrophotometer (Beckman). Other chemicals were of the highest grade commercially available.

Preparation of BtrN. BtrN was overexpressed in *Escherichia coli*, anaerobically purified, and reconstituted in vitro as previously reported (14) with minor modifications. All buffer solutions were degassed with a freeze−thaw procedure under reduced pressure, followed by bubbling with a mixture of argon and hydrogen gas purified through a reduced Cu catalyst. The purified BtrN (~0.07 mM) was reconstituted with Na₂S (0.67 mM) and Fe²⁺(NH₄)₂(SO₄)₂ (0.67 mM) and incubated for 40 min at room temperature. Excess Fe ion was trapped by addition of EDTA (0.85 mM) and desalted with a Hi-trap desalting column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to prepare the reconstituted BtrN. Protein concentrations were determined with the Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad) using bovine plasma γ-globulin as a standard. Enzymes were freshly prepared for each set of experiments. The DOIA oxidation activity of BtrN was confirmed as follows. BtrN (0.18–0.23 μM) was incubated with DOIA (0.1 mM) and varied concentrations of SAM (0.03, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, and 1.6 mM) in 50 mM HEPES-NaOH (pH 8.0) in the presence of sodium dithionite (10 mM) at room temperature for 0.5 h. The reaction was quenched with 10% trichloroacetic acid, and the generated 5′-deoxyadenosine was quantitated by HPLC as previously reported (14). Reactions were run in duplicate, and the data were fitted to the Michaelis−Menten equation [v/[BtrN] = kcat[SAM]/(KM + [SAM])] by a least-squares method.

Determination of the Iron Content. The quantitation of the iron content was conducted using the reported procedure (17). A BtrN solution (200 μL, without sodium dithionite) was treated with 100 μL of reagent A (2.25% KMnO₄ in 0.6 N aqueous HCl) at 60 °C for 2 h, followed by the addition of 20 μL of reagent B (8.8 g of ascorbate, 9.7 g of ammonium acetate, 80 mg of ferrozine, and 80 mg of neocuproine dissolved in 25 mL of water), and the mixture was incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Absorption at 562 nm was measured, and the iron concentrations of the samples were determined according to the standard curve generated by 10–50 μM Fe²⁺(NH₄)₂(SO₄)₂.

**MATERIALS AND METHODS**

General Procedure. HPLC was performed on a Hitachi L-6250 Intelligent Pump equipped with a Senshu Pak ODS 1251N column (4.6 mm × 250 mm, Senshu Scientific, Japan), an L-4000H UV detector, and a D-2500 Chromato-Integrator for the enzyme assay. ¹H, ²H, and ¹³C NMR spectra were recorded with a JEOL Lambda-400 spectrometer or a Bruker DRX-500 spectrometer. Deuterium oxide (Merck, 99.9 at. % enriched) was used as an NMR solvent. Chemical

5 mM), and D-[6,6-²H₂]glucose (18 mg, 5 mM) were incubated in 20 mL of 50 mM HEPES-NaOH (pH 8.0) at 37 °C for 30 min. Then, NAD⁺ (20 mg), 2-deoxy-scyllo-inosose (DOI) synthase (BtrC, 20 μM), and CoCl₂ (1.25 mM) were added, and the reaction mixture was further incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. After removal of the precipitate by centrifugation, the reaction mixture was applied to an Amberlite CG50 (H⁺ form) column and the unabsorbed fraction was collected. After the pH of the solution had been adjusted to 8.0 with 0.2 M aqueous NaOH, L-glutamine:DOI aminotransferase (BtrS, 20 μM), PLP (0.5 mM), and L-glutamine (10 mM) were added, and the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 4 h. The precipitate was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was applied to an Amberlite CG50 (NH₄⁺ form) column. The column was washed with 50 mM NH₄OH, and DOIA was then eluted with 200 mM NH₄OH. The solvent was removed in vacuo with a rotary evaporator, and the counteranion was exchanged with chloride when the sample was passed through a DOWEX AG1X8 (Cl⁻ form) column to yield 2-deoxy-scyllo-[2,2-²H₂]inosamine hydrochloride (8.2 mg, 92 at. % D): ¹H NMR (400 MHz, D₂O) δ 3.09 (d, *J* = 10.4 Hz, 1H), 3.20 (t, *J* = 6.8 Hz, 1H), 3.22 (t, *J* = 6.9 Hz, 1H), 3.35–3.43 (m, 1H), 3.49–3.55 (m, 1H); ¹³C NMR (125 MHz, D₂O) δ 31.64 (*q*, *J* = 22 Hz), 49.72, 68.4, 72.8, 74.3, 76.1; ²H NMR (61 MHz, D₂O) δ 1.43, 2.12.

**Preparation of Amino-DOI.** BtrS (50 μM) was incubated with 2-deoxystreptamine (4 mM, 18.4 mg), pyruvate (100 mM, 220 mg), and PLP (0.5 mM) in 20 mL of 50 mM HEPES-NaOH (pH 8.0) at 28 °C for 3 h. After removal of the enzyme by ultrafiltration, the solution was applied to a DOWEX AG1X8 (acetate form) column and the unadsorbed fraction was collected. The resultant filtrate was applied to an Amberlite CG50 (H⁺ form) column, and the column was washed with water. Then, elution was carried out with a linear gradient from 0 to 100 mM aqueous HCl (total of 300 mL). Amino-DOI was eluted at 20–33 mM HCl, and the solvent was removed in vacuo. The residue was further purified with Sephadex G-10 (100 mL, 1.0 cm × 120 cm) to remove inorganic salt. The elution was carried out with water to yield pure amino-DOI (3.7 mg). Hydrate form: ¹H NMR (400 MHz, D₂O) δ 1.70 (t, *J* = 12.0 Hz, 1H, H-2ax), 2.14 (dd, *J* = 4.4, 12.0 Hz, 1H, H-2eq), 3.13 (ddd, *J* = 4.4, 10.2, 12.0 Hz, 1H, H-3), 3.30–3.43 (m, 3H, H-4, -5, -6); ¹³C NMR (125 MHz, D₂O) δ 36.57, 49.96, 72.92, 73.79, 75.78, 92.88; HR-FAB-MS (positive, glycerol) *m/z* 180.0872 (M + H)⁺, calcd for C₆H₁₄O₅N 180.0872.

**EPR Measurements.** The reconstituted BtrN was reduced with sodium dithionite (10 mM) at room temperature for 1 h and incubated with substrates or products in 50 mM HEPES-NaOH (pH 8.0). For EPR measurements during the catalytic cycle, BtrN (35 μM) was incubated with SAM (1 mM) and DOIA (1 mM) in the presence of sodium dithionite (10 mM) at room temperature, and the reaction was freeze-quenched in liquid nitrogen at set time points (3, 10, 20, 40, and 60 min). When deuterated DOIA was used as a substrate, BtrN (21 μM) was incubated with SAM (1 mM) and DOIA (1 mM) in the presence of sodium dithionite (10 mM) at room temperature for 10 min before the reaction was freeze-quenched in liquid nitrogen. For EPR measurements of the BtrN-substrate and BtrN-product complexes, BtrN was incubated with substrates (SAM and DOIA) and/or products (5′-deoxyadenosine, L-methionine, and amino-DOI) at room temperature for 20 min and freeze-quenched in liquid nitrogen. The precise conditions, including enzyme concentrations and combinations of additives, are described in the legend of each figure. EPR spectra were recorded with a JEOL JES-FA300 ESR spectrometer (9.02 GHz). Recording conditions are indicated in the legend of each figure. EPR simulation was achieved using AniSimu/FA version 2.0.0 (JEOL). Quantitation of the EPR signals was achieved by comparison of the double integrals with those of a standard sample of 0.01 μmol of CuSO₄.

**Reverse Reaction of BtrN.** Amino-DOI (2 mM) was incubated with BtrN (17 μM), L-methionine (5 mM), 5′-deoxyadenosine (5 mM), and sodium dithionite (10 mM) in 50 mM HEPES-NaOH (pH 8.0) at 28 °C for 12 h. An aliquot (20 μL) of the mixture was treated with 20 μL of 5% 2,4-dinitrofluorobenzene in methanol, 10 μL of DMSO, and 2 μL of 2 M NaOH at 60 °C for 1 h. The solvent was then removed in vacuo and redissolved in 0.1 mL of methanol. The resultant mixture was diluted with 3 mL of water and passed through the Sep-Pak C-18 cartridge (Waters). The cartridge was washed with 7 mL of water, and the product, 2,4-dinitrophenyl-DOIA, was eluted with 5 mL of methanol. After removal of the solvent by a centrifugal evaporator, the residue was dissolved in 100 μL of methanol. An aliquot (5 μL) of the solution was injected into the same HPLC system as described above and eluted with 30% aqueous methanol at a flow rate of 0.9 mL/min at room temperature. The eluent was monitored at 350 nm.

**RESULTS**

**Determination of the BtrN Iron Content.** Before the precise mechanistic studies by EPR, the Fe content of BtrN was determined. Fe quantitation of BtrN prepared with the previously reported procedure resulted in large and variable values for the amount of Fe (10–20 Fe atoms per polypeptide). We presumed that this is due to FeS precipitation and/or nonspecifically bound Fe copurified with BtrN by gel filtration after reconstitution. To prevent this phenomenon, the reconstituted BtrN was treated with EDTA to remove those excess iron ions. Expression and purification of BtrN were conducted as previously reported. Purified BtrN was then incubated with Fe(II) (0.67 mM) and Na₂S (0.67 mM) for 40 min at room temperature, and the excess Fe ion was trapped by addition of a slight excess of EDTA (0.85 mM) and removed by gel filtration. Since the use of EDTA in Fe–S reconstitution includes the risk of losing the weakly bound Fe–S cluster required for an enzyme activity, as is the case for MiaB (18), the specific activity of the reconstituted BtrN was measured. The apparent kinetic constant of EDTA-treated BtrN (*K*~M,SAM,app~ = 0.31 ± 0.12 mM and *k*~cat,app~ = 1.3 ± 0.10 min⁻¹ at 0.1 mM DOIA; see the Supporting Information for data sets) and the previously reported value obtained for BtrN reconstituted without the addition of EDTA

EPR Study of a Radical SAM Dehydrogenase

FIGURE 1: EPR spectra of the BtrN reaction. (a) EPR spectrum of the BtrN reaction recorded at 50 K with a microwave power of 0.4 mW. BtrN (35 μM) was incubated with DOIA (1 mM), SAM (1 mM), and sodium dithionite (10 mM) in 50 mM HEPES-NaOH (pH 8.0) at room temperature for 10 min, and the mixture was freeze-quenched manually in liquid nitrogen. (B) EPR spectrum of the BtrN reaction using [2,2-²H₂]DOIA recorded at 50 K with a microwave power of 0.4 mW. BtrN (21 μM) was incubated with [2,2-²H₂]DOIA (1 mM), SAM (1 mM), and sodium dithionite (10 mM) in 50 mM HEPES-NaOH (pH 8.0) at room temperature for 10 min and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Recording conditions: modulation width, 0.6 mT; modulation frequency, 100 kHz; microwave power, 0.4 mW. Averages of four scans were used.

Scheme 3: Preparation of [2,2-²H₂]DOIA

(K_{M,SAM,app} = 0.46 ± 0.10 mM, and k_{cat,app} = 1.2 ± 0.10 min⁻¹ at 0.1 mM DOIA) (14) were identical within the range of error. This result suggests that, in this case, EDTA treatment removed only FeS precipitation and/or nonspecifically bound Fe ions, which could not be removed by gel filtration. The iron quantitation of the prepared BtrN resulted in 4.0 ± 0.1 iron ions per monomer. The EPR signal of BtrN reconstituted with EDTA exhibited an axial signal (Figures 4 and 5) identical to the previous report (14). Spin quantitations of the signal resulted in 0.4–0.6 spin per monomer. Fluctuation in the spin amount is probably due to incomplete reduction, which was also observed for other radical SAM enzymes (19, 20). All these results indicate that BtrN has one [4Fe-4S]⁺ cluster per monomer.

Observation of an Organic Radical Intermediate. To analyze the BtrN reaction by EPR spectroscopy, the reduced BtrN (35 μM protein with 17.5 μM spins) was incubated with SAM (1 mM) and DOIA (1 mM) in the presence of sodium dithionite (10 mM) at room temperature for 10 min and the mixture was flash-frozen manually in liquid nitrogen. The EPR spectrum was first recorded at 50 K to detect signals of organic radical species. As a result, a sharp double triplet signal with hyperfine coupling constants of 0.76 ± 0.02 and 3.6 ± 0.3 mT was observed at g = 2.0025 ± 0.0005 (Figure 1a). According to power saturation experiments, the signal was not saturated under this condition (data not shown). The spin concentration was estimated to be 0.14 μM by comparing a double integral of the signal with a standard Cu(II)SO₄. This signal was not observed when either of the substrates or BtrN was omitted, indicating this signal is derived from a reaction intermediate. According to the hyperfine structure, the signal was presumed to be that of the DOIA radical intermediate. To further characterize the signal, deuterated DOIA was prepared and used for the EPR measurement.

2-Deoxy-scyllo-[2,2-²H₂]inosamine ([2,2-²H₂]DOIA, 92 at. % D) was prepared from D-[6,6-²H₂]glucose using hexokinase, 2-deoxy-scyllo-inosose synthase (BtrC) (21), and 2-deoxy-scyllo-inosose:L-glutamine aminotransferase (BtrS)

ring. These results suggest the pπ orbital of the isolated electron and the axial protons have almost an eclipse conformation as shown in Figure 2c.

EPR Signal for the 4Fe–4S Cluster during the Catalytic Cycle. The EPR spectrum of the reaction mixture [BtrN (35 μM protein with 17.5 μM spins) with DOIA (1 mM), SAM (1 mM), and sodium dithionite (10 mM), incubated for 10 min at room temperature] described above was also recorded at 10 K. As a result, the EPR signal for the [4Fe-4S]+ cluster was significantly decreased from that of the unreacted [4Fe-4S]+ cluster of BtrN (Figure 3a), and its shape was also dramatically changed. The g = 2.01 (320 mT) peak is a saturated broadened signal of the DOIA radical intermediate. To reduce the contribution of this signal, signals of the Fe–S cluster were amplified by increasing the microwave power.

Power saturation experiments indicated that the spin relaxation of the signals presumably derived from the Fe–S cluster was not saturated at least up to the microwave power of 8 mW at 10 K, while the feature at 320 mT became negligible under this condition (Figure 3b,c). The obtained signal had new features [g = 1.83, 1.89, 2.01, and 2.04 (Figure 3c)]. The signal seemed to be a mixture of several chemical species and was quite difficult to interpret at this point. To assign these signals, the effects of addition of substrate and product on the EPR signal were examined.

The EPR signal of BtrN (35 μM) incubated with SAM (1 mM) dramatically changed from that of free BtrN (Figure 4a). The newly generated signal had a shorter spin relaxation time and could be distinguished from the signal of free BtrN by increasing the microwave power (Figure 4b; see the

Signal intensities were normalized according to the spin amount of free BtrN since it differed upon enzyme preparations. BtrN with 0.4 spin per monomer was used for panels b, d, and e, and BtrN with 0.6 spin per monomer was used for panels a, c, and f.

Supporting Information for power saturation experiments). From these experiments, the signal generated by SAM addition was shown to have an axial feature with g values of 1.83 and 1.99.

The addition of DOIA also showed a new \( g = 2.01 \) and 2.09 feature (Figure 4c). The intensity of the signal was increased at 5 K, suggesting that its spin relaxation is faster than that of the free BtrN, which exhibited the highest intensity at 10 K (see the Supporting Information). Even though the substrate/enzyme ratio was increased 3.5-fold, only approximately 30% of the signal derived from the free BtrN disappeared (Figure 4c). These results suggest that DOIA can also bind to the enzyme active site near the cluster independently, but rather weakly relative to SAM.

The effects of product binding on the EPR signal of the 4Fe−4S cluster were also examined. BtrN (30 μM) was incubated with amino-DOI, L-methionine, 5′-deoxyadenosine, or their mixture and was analyzed by EPR (Figure 5). The concentration of each additive was uniformly adjusted to 1 mM, which is the maximum concentration possible in the BtrN reaction mixture described in the legends of Figures 1 and 3. Amino-DOI was prepared by deamination of 2-deoxyystreptamine by BtrS (27, 28) using pyruvate as an amino acceptor as described in Materials and Methods. Amino-DOI could be isolated in the hydrochloride form without further derivatizations, and its structure was confirmed by NMR, HR-FAB-MS, and IR spectroscopy. The isolated amino-DOI existed in both keto and hydrate form in a water solution, which was also the case for 2-deoxy-scyllo-inosose (29).

When amino-DOI, L-methionine, or 5′-deoxyadenosine was separately added to a BtrN solution, a significant effect was not observed on the EPR signal of the cluster at all (Figure 5a–c). Only 5′-deoxyadenosine exhibited a small perturbation for the \( g = 1.93 \) peak (Figure 5a). Power saturation experiments with the 5′-deoxyadenosine-supplemented BtrN solution showed that the signal was already saturated under this condition (data not shown), which should be the cause of the change in the shape of the spectrum. On the other hand, a significant decrease in signal intensity was observed when L-methionine and 5′-deoxyadenosine were added simultaneously (Figure 5d). No new signal for the Fe−S cluster or organic radical species was observed even in the lower magnetic field area at temperatures of 5–80 K and microwave powers of 0.1–50 mW. The addition of DOIA (Figure 5e) or amino-DOI (Figure 5f) to this mixture did not generate any new signals except for \( g = 2.01 \) and 2.09 features, which were also observed in the independent incubation of DOIA with reduced BtrN (Figure 4c). Again, no organic radical was observed in these mixtures. Since the UV−vis absorption spectrum of the 4Fe−4S cluster was not changed upon addition of L-methionine and 5′-deoxyadenosine (Figure 6), it seemed unlikely that the oxidation of the [4Fe-4S]⁺ cluster to a [4Fe-4S]²⁺ cluster occurred under this condition. This signal decrease caused by L-methionine and 5′-deoxyadenosine binding is discussed below.

Comparing the EPR signals observed during the catalytic cycle (Figure 3c) with the EPR signals of BtrN incubated

FIGURE 6: UV—vis spectra of BtrN: (blue line) as-reconstituted BtrN (24 μM), (red line) BtrN (24 μM) reduced with dithionite (10 mM) for 30 min at room temperature, (yellow line) BtrN (24 μM) reduced with dithionite (10 mM) for 30 min at room temperature, followed by incubation with L-methionine (1 mM) and 5′-deoxyadenosine (1 mM) for 30 min at room temperature.

with various combinations of substrates and products (Figures 4 and 5), we can identify the $g = 1.91$ feature observed during the reaction as the signal of free BtrN and the $g = 1.83$ and 2.01 features as the signal of the SAM-bound 4Fe–4S cluster of BtrN (Figures 3c and 4a,b). On the other hand, $g = 1.89$ and 2.04 features were observed only during the catalytic cycle. To further characterize these signals, signals of free BtrN and the BtrN–SAM complex were subtracted from the signal observed during the catalytic cycle (Figure 3c). The signal of the BtrN–SAM complex was subtracted so that the $g = 1.83$ feature became flat. The signal of free BtrN was subtracted to make the $g = 1.91$ feature negligible. The spectra of free BtrN and the BtrN–SAM complex used for the subtraction were both recorded under the same conditions as the experiment described for Figure 3c. As a result, the spectrum of free BtrN with 0.5 μM spins (7% of the spectrum containing 7.1 μM spins) and the spectrum of the BtrN–SAM complex with 1.8 μM spins (18% of the spectrum containing 10 μM spins) were subtracted, and a rhombic signal with $g$ values of 1.87, 1.96, and 2.05 was obtained (Figure 7). The spin concentration of this rhombic signal was estimated to be 2.1 μM. This signal was observed only in the presence of the both substrates, and not observed in other combinations of substrates or products. Thus, the rhombic signal should be derived from an intermediate after the formation of the BtrN–SAM complex and before the formation of the BtrN–amino-DOI–5′-deoxyadenosine–methionine quaternary complex (Scheme 4). Considering the catalytic role of the 4Fe–4S cluster, the initial [4Fe-4S]⁺ cluster should be oxidized to a [4Fe-4S]²⁺ cluster and become EPR silent upon reductive cleavage of SAM until the oxidized cluster is reduced somehow by the DOIA radical, which should generate the BtrN–amino-DOI–5′-deoxyadenosine–methionine quaternary complex (Schemes 2 and 4). Since the incubation of BtrN with 5′-deoxyadenosine, L-methionine, and amino-DOI did not result in generation of such a rhombic signal, the signal cannot be derived from the BtrN–amino-DOI–5′-deoxyadenosine–methionine quaternary complex. Thus, a BtrN–SAM–DOIA ternary complex is the only one possible EPR active intermediate left uncharacterized, and it is reasonable to assign the rhombic signal as the BtrN–SAM–DOIA ternary complex.

FIGURE 7: EPR spectrum obtained after subtraction of the signals of the free BtrN (0.5 μM spins) and the BtrN–SAM complex (1.8 μM spins) from the spectrum observed during catalytic turnover. The spectra of free BtrN and the BtrN–SAM complex were recorded under the same condition described in the legend of Figure 3c. The red line represents a simulated curve. The following parameters were used: $g = 1.87$, 1.96, and 2.05; Lorentzian ratio of 20% and Gaussian ratio of 80%; spectrum widths $\Sigma_X = 3.80$ mT, $\Sigma_Y = 7.00$ mT, and $\Sigma_Z = 5.00$ mT.

The time course of the intensities of the signals observed during catalytic turnover was shown in Figure 8. The spin concentrations of the rhombic signal were estimated by comparison of a double integral of each signal with that of the Cu(II)SO₄ standard. The signal of the DOIA radical showed the highest intensity at 3 min and became almost constant after 20 min, which suggests the presteady state accumulation of DOIA radical (Figure 8a,b). The spin concentration of the rhombic signal was estimated from the comparison of peak-to-peak intensity of the $g = 1.89$ and 2.04 features with that of the signal shown in Figure 3a whose concentration was determined to be 2.1 μM as described above. As a result, the spin concentrations of the rhombic signal were also highest at the beginning of the reaction (Figure 8c,d). The reaction was repeated twice, and similar presteady state accumulations of both signals were observed in all experiments. Presteady state accumulation of the rhombic signal suggests that the signal is derived from an intermediate before the rate-determining step, presumably ketone formation, which is consistent with the assignment of the rhombic signal as the BtrN–SAM–DOIA complex.

Furthermore, when the incubation was continued for more than 60 min, we observed a decrease in both signals after 120 min and almost complete disappearance after 240 min (see the Supporting Information). We have previously reported that when BtrN (30 μM) was incubated with DOIA (1 mM) and SAM (0.9 mM) for 240 min at room temperature, more than 70% of DOIA was converted into amino-DOI and the reaction rate dramatically decreased (14). Since the reaction condition in this paper is similar to those of the previous report, disappearance of both signals by completion of the reaction further supports the possibility that both signals are derived from reaction intermediates. Disappearance of the 4Fe–4S cluster signal should be due to the accumulation of the BtrN–amino-DOI–5′-deoxyadenosine–methionine or BtrN–5′-deoxyadenosine–methionine complex, whose 4Fe–4S clusters were shown to be difficult to detect by EPR.

EPR Study of a Radical SAM Dehydrogenase

DISCUSSION

BtrN is a radical SAM dehydrogenase catalyzing DOIA oxidation coupled with reductive cleavage of SAM. To gain further insights into the reaction mechanism, we first characterized the Fe–S cluster of BtrN. The results of Fe quantitation resulted in 4.0 ± 0.1 irons per polypeptide, and EPR spin quantitation showed 0.4–0.6 spin per monomer. Although BtrN has five cysteines other than those of the radical SAM 4Fe–4S cluster motif, they are not conserved in other Fe–S cluster proteins, and no other motifs for the Fe–S cluster were found. Thus, our results indicate the presence of only one 4Fe–4S cluster per BtrN subunit. However, considering that some radical SAM enzymes have multiple Fe–S clusters in a single subunit (15, 18, 30–32), Mössbauer experiments might be required for a more accurate characterization of the cluster composition.

From the BtrN reaction solution containing SAM and DOIA, an EPR signal derived from the DOIA radical intermediate was observed at 50 K. The observation of the radical intermediate strongly supports the previously proposed radical mechanism (Scheme 2). The time course of the signal intensity showed the accumulation of the DOIA radical during the presteady state, which lasted for at least 20 min under this condition (Figure 8). This long presteady state is consistent with a slow reaction rate of BtrN (~0.2 min⁻¹ under this condition). Considering that the incubation of BtrN with 5′-deoxyadenosine, L-methionine, and amino-DOI did not generate a detectable amount of DOIA radical (Figure 5) or DOIA itself (see the Supporting Information), ketone formation should be an irreversible reaction. Thus, the accumulation of the DOIA radical intermediate during the presteady state suggests that ketone formation is the rate-determining step in this reaction. The slow rate of ketone formation is consistent with the previously reported accumulation of deuterium in 5′-deoxyadenosine and small kinetic isotope effect observed when [3-²H]DOIA was used as a substrate (14).

The observed DOIA radical should be further oxidized via the release of an electron and a proton to generate amino-DOI. Since the reaction proceeds without addition of external electron acceptors, the [4Fe-4S]²⁺ cluster was proposed to be the final electron acceptor (14). The observed DOIA radical can easily be converted to a highly reductive ketyl radical by deprotonation (for example, cyclohexanone has –2.2 V) (33), which should be sufficient to reduce the [4Fe-4S]²⁺ cluster (–0.4 to –0.5 V) (34). Since pKa values of aliphatic ketyl radicals are generally 3–5 units lower than those of their corresponding alcohols (for example, pKa = 16 for cyclohexanol and pKa = 12.1 for cyclohexanone ketyl) (33, 35, 36), such generation of transient ketyl radical should be possible if there is an appropriate base near the C-3 hydroxy group of DOIA. Thus, although the participation of a disulfide bond or other electron sink mechanism cannot be excluded, at this point, it is reasonable to presume that further oxidation of the DOIA radical proceeds via a transient ketyl radical through proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET), which is known to be a critical mechanism for oxidations and reductions of radical species in several other biological systems such as galactose oxidase and P450 enzymes (12, 13, 37, 38). Furthermore, it is noteworthy that a ketyl

radical was recently identified as an intermediate in a reaction catalyzed by 2-hydroxy-4-methylpentanoyl-CoA dehydratase (39).

As for the reaction catalyzed by radical SAM enzymes, observations of radical intermediates are quite limited. Lysine-2,3-aminomutase is the only radical SAM enzyme so far for which the organic radical intermediate had been characterized in the presteady state and in the steady state of the reaction (40–43). Substrate-derived organic radical species were also reported for the reaction of coproporphyrin III oxidase, HemN (44). In the HemN reaction, organic radical species were observed only when the subsequent electron transfer reaction was interrupted by the omission of an outside electron acceptor. This study is now the second example of a radical intermediate observed in the steady state and presteady state of a reaction catalyzed by a radical SAM enzyme.

In this series of EPR measurements, no organic radical that can be assigned as the 5′-deoxyadenosyl radical was observed, while the signal for the putative BtrN–SAM–DOIA complex and the DOIA radical intermediate were observed. Even a reaction with 2-deoxy-scyllo-[3-²H]inosamine that should slow the hydrogen atom abstraction did not result in the accumulation of the 5′-deoxyadenosyl radical (data not shown). Since the SAM cleavage was shown to be reversible in this reaction (14), these results indicate that the subsequent hydrogen atom abstraction and/or the reverse reaction to regenerate SAM is fast, which makes the 5′-deoxyadenosyl radical exist only transiently. The transient nature of the 5′-

deoxyadenosyl radical is likely to be a common feature for radical SAM enzymes, since such radical species are observed only when an allylic analogue of SAM is used (45, 46).

The EPR spectrum of the 4Fe–4S cluster during the reaction was also recorded, and the signals for a free BtrN, a BtrN–SAM complex, and a rhombic signal presumably derived from the BtrN–SAM–DOIA ternary complex were observed (Figure 3). The assignment of the rhombic signal as the BtrN–SAM–DOIA ternary complex was accomplished by the comparison of the signal with those of other BtrN–substrate and BtrN–product complexes. The time course of the EPR signal revealed the presteady state accumulation of the rhombic signal as well as that of the DOIA radical intermediate, which indicates that the rhombic signal is derived from an intermediate before the rate-determining step, ketone formation, and thus further supports the assignment of the rhombic signal to the BtrN–SAM–DOIA ternary complex. The signal for the BtrN–DOIA complex was not observed during the reaction, which is consistent with the previously proposed kinetic mechanism that SAM binds first to free BtrN and then DOIA binds to the BtrN–SAM complex. The time course of the EPR spectra showed that the signals of the DOIA radical and 4Fe–4S clusters were all decreased in the presteady state without the formation of any new signals. Since the BtrN–product complexes show no characteristic feature in EPR (Figure 5), the decrease in the magnitude of the EPR signal of the Fe–S

cluster indicates the formation of BtrN-product complexes. The invisibilities of these complexes are further discussed below.

The significant differences in EPR signals among free BtrN, the BtrN-SAM complex, and the BtrN-SAM-DOIA complex are quite intriguing. As for other radical SAM enzymes, SAM has been shown to coordinate directly to the vacant site of the 4Fe-4S cluster according to X-ray crystallographic analyses and ENDOR experiments (30, 31, 47–51). In addition, significant EPR signal changes have been observed upon binding of SAM for pyruvate formate lyase activase and class III ribonucleotide reductase activase (51–53). BtrN also exhibited a change in EPR signal upon SAM binding, indicating a direct coordination of SAM to the 4Fe-4S cluster. Perturbation of the EPR signal by addition of DOIA to the free BtrN solution (Figure 3c) and the change from axial signal of the BtrN-SAM complex to the rhombic signal of the BtrN-SAM-DOIA ternary complex (Figure 7) suggest that DOIA also affects the electronic state of the 4Fe-4S cluster directly or through a protein conformational changing. Such an interaction may trigger the reductive cleavage of SAM and generation of the DOIA radical intermediate (34, 54).

Although most of the EPR signals observed in this study are reasonably interpreted as described above, the decrease in the EPR signal intensity upon binding of the products remains unresolved. Since UV-vis absorption spectra did not change (Figure 6), a change in the redox state of the cluster is unlikely. One possible explanation is a change in the spin state of the cluster from \( S = \frac{1}{2} \) to \( S = \frac{3}{2}, \frac{5}{2} \), or \( \frac{9}{2} \). EPR signals of such high-spin state 4Fe-4S clusters should be broadened and might have escaped detection at the low concentrations used in our experiments. Experiments that aim to characterize this EPR silent Fe-S cluster are ongoing.

In conclusion, we have successfully observed the DOIA radical intermediate by EPR measurements, which strongly suggests the radical mechanism of BtrN. Furthermore, EPR signals for free BtrN, the BtrN-SAM complex, and a rhombic signal presumably derived from the BtrN-SAM-DOIA ternary complex were also observed during the reaction. Significant changes in signal features among those complexes suggest electronic interactions of both substrates with the 4Fe-4S cluster. Our observations should aid in the understanding of the whole catalytic cycle of BtrN and other radical SAM dehydrogenases.
