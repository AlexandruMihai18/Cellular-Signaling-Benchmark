Dynamin is a large GTP-binding protein that mediates endocytosis by hydrolyzing GTP¹,²,³. Previously, we reported that phospholipase D2 (PLD2) interacts with dynamin in a GTP-dependent manner⁴. This implies that PLD may regulate the GTPase cycle of dynamin. Here, we show that PLD functions as a GTPase activating protein (GAP) through its phox homology domain (PX), which directly activates the GTPase domain of dynamin, and that the arginine residues in the PLD–PX are vital for this GAP function. Moreover, wild-type PLD–PX, but not mutated PLD–PXs defective for GAP function *in vitro*, increased epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) endocytosis at physiological EGF concentrations. In addition, the silencing of PLDs was shown to retard EGFR endocytosis and the addition of wild-type PLDs or lipase-inactive PLDs, but not PLD1 mutants with defective GAP activity for dynamin *in vitro*, resulted in the recovery of EGFR endocytosis. These findings suggest that PLD, functioning as an intermolecular GAP for dynamin, accelerates EGFR endocytosis. Moreover, we determined that the phox homology domain itself had GAP activity — a novel function in addition to its role as a binding motif for proteins or lipids.

In addition, PLD1 interacted with dynamin in a concentration-dependent manner (see Supplementary Information, Fig. S1a). Truncation of the amino (N)-terminal 185-amino acids containing the phox homology domain of PLD2 resulted in the complete abolition of binding between dynamin and PLD2 (data not shown). It was also confirmed that dynamin can interact with the phox homology domain of PLD1 and PLD2 (Fig. 1c) and that this interaction is concentration-dependent (see Supplementary Information, Fig. S1b). Dynamin contains a variety of functional domains, including the GTPase domain, the pleckstrin homology domain, the GTPase effector domain (GED) and a proline-rich domain (PRD)¹¹. The GST–GTPase domain, similar to full-length dynamin, specifically bound to PLD1 in a GTP-dependent manner (Fig. 1d and see Supplementary Information, Fig. S1c). Therefore, we concluded that the phox homology domains of PLD1 or PLD2 interact with dynamin in a GTP-dependent manner, through the GTPase domain of dynamin.

In general, members of the small G-protein family can interact with a variety of effector proteins or GAPs in their GTP-bound active states¹². As shown in Fig. 1, PLD interacts with dynamin in a GTP-dependent manner; therefore, the possibility that PLD functions as a GAP for dynamin was evaluated. The GTPase activity of dynamin was increased by the phox homology domain of PLD1 or PLD2 in dose and time-dependent manner (Fig. 2a, b). The specific rate of GTP hydrolysis of dynamin stimulated by the PLDs–PX was approximately 160 (nmol min⁻¹ mg⁻¹). Furthermore, the GAP activity of full-length PLD1 was similar to that of PLD1–PX (Fig. 2c). It has been reported that the GTPase activity of dynamin is increased by its GED, a known intramolecular GAP¹³. To exclude the possibility that PLD–PX affects the GED, the GTPase activity of the GTPase domain, which does not contain a GED, was assessed. PLD1–PX increased the GTPase activity of the dynamin GTPase domain markedly more than the GED of dynamin (Fig. 2d and see Supplementary Information, Fig. S2b). Moreover, the GAP function of PLD1–PX was more effective than that of growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2), which stimulates the GTPase activity of dynamin by increasing dynamin self-assembly.

Figure 2 The phox homology domain of PLD functions as a GAP for dynamin in vitro. (a) The indicated amounts of PLD1–PX and PLD2–PX were preincubated with dynamin for 30 min at room temperature and then allowed to react with α-³²P labelled GTP for 30min at 37 °C. GTP and GDP were then separated by thin layer chromatography (TLC). The error bars represent mean ± s.d. (n = 3). (b) PLD1–PX or PLD2–PX (1 μM) were preincubated with dynamin for 30 min at room temperature, then allowed to react with α-³²P labelled GTP for the indicated times at 37 °C. GTP and GDP were separated by TLC. The error bars represent mean ± s.d. (n = 3). (c) PLD1–PX or full-length PLD1 (0.2 μM) were preincubated with dynamin for 30 min at room temperature and then allowed to react with α-³²P labelled GTP for 1 h at 37 °C. GTP and GDP were separated by TLC. (d) The indicated amounts of GST, GST–GED or GST–PLD1–PX were preincubated with the GTPase domain of dynamin for 30 min at room temperature and then allowed to react with α-³²P labelled GTP for 30 min at 37 °C. GTP and GDP were separated by TLC. (e) Dynamin (0.3 μM) was mixed with 1 μM of GST, GST–PLD1–PX or GST–Grb2. Aliquots were analysed by SDS–PAGE.

Several reports have indicated that efficient GTP hydrolysis by dynamin is crucial for endocytosis¹⁸,¹⁹. Previous studies have suggested that phosphatidic acid production by PLD activation is important for receptor-mediated endocytosis²⁰,²¹. As phox homology domains, and not the catalytic region of PLD, have been shown to affect the GTPase activities of dynamin in vitro, we investigated the relationship between PLD and EGFR endocytosis under conditions that did not affect PLD activity. As shown in Fig. 4a, EGF-induced PLD activity and EGFR endocytosis were increased by treatment with EGF in a dose-dependent manner (2 and 20 nM; Fig. 4a). Also, EGFR endocytosis occurred in the presence of 0.2 nM EGF, which did not activate PLD (physiological EGF concentrations range from 0.1–1 nM²²). Moreover, EGFR endocytosis induced by EGF did not affect the transferrin receptor (Figs. 4a, b). Therefore, the effects of PLD1–PX were assessed with regard to EGFR endocytosis using 0.2 nM EGF. As the amounts of transfected PLD1–PX were increased, EGFR endocytosis increased (Fig. 4c) and this effect also occurred in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 4d). In contrast with wild-type PLD1–PX, EGFR endocytosis was unaffected when the PLD1–PX mutants (R128K and R197K), with a defective GAP activity for dynamin in vitro, were overexpressed (Fig. 4e). These findings demonstrate that increased EGFR endocytosis observed at physiological EGF concentrations is dependent on the GAP activity of PLD–PX, and not on the activity of PLD.

We have previously reported that the interaction between PLD and dynamin is transient and peaks 0.5–1 min after treatment with EGF⁴. Here, we demonstrated that an interaction between PLD and dynamin occurs at low EGF concentrations (see Supplementary Information, Fig. S3a). Silencing of PLDs using small interference RNAs (siRNA) for multiple regions of PLDs resulted in the retardation of EGFR endocytosis and silencing of both PLD1 and PLD2 induced a more profound retardation of EGFR endocytosis than PLD1 silencing alone (Fig. 5a and see Supplementary Information, Fig. S3b). EGFR endocytosis was retarded by adding siRNA against PLDs, and was recovered by adding wild-type PLDs or lipase-inactive PLDs KRm (mutation of lysine to arginine in the catalytic region of PLD; Fig. 5b). However, the addition of PLD1 mutants (R128K or R197K), which are comparable with wild-type PLD1 with regard to their in vivo activities (data not shown), did not restore EGFR endocytosis after siRNA-mediated PLD1 and PLD2 silencing (Fig. 5b). The influence of PLD on EGFR endocytosis was also assessed by confocal microscopy. The siRNAs against the PLDs reduced the amount of rhodamine-labelled EGF in intracellular vesicular compartments as compared with luciferase siRNA after 15 min of EGF treatment (0.2 nM). The effects of adding wild-type PLDs or PLDKRm, but not the PLD1R128K or PLD1R197K mutants, to PLD-silenced cells were comparable with the effects of luciferase siRNA with regard to rhodamine-EGF uptake (Fig. 5c). These findings suggest that the GAP properties of PLDs for dynamin exert an influence on EGFR endocytosis. Insulin receptor endocytosis was also increased in an insulin dose-dependent manner and this also occurred in the presence of 0.1 nM insulin (physiological insulin concentrations range from 0.1–0.5 nM²³), which did not activate PLD (see Supplementary information, Fig. S4a, b). Similar to the effect of

PLD on EGFR endocytosis, insulin receptor endocytosis was retarded by administering siRNA against PLDs and was recovered by adding wild-type PLDs or PLD<sup>KRm</sup>, but was not recovered by adding PLD1<sup>R128K</sup> or PLD1<sup>R197K</sup> (see Supplementary Information, Fig. S4c). Therefore, it is possible that the GAP function of PLDs for dynamin is not specific for EGFR endocytosis, but is a common mechanism for growth factor receptor internalization at physiological concentration of agonists.

PLD has been implicated in a variety of signalling events, including vesicle trafficking, proliferation, cytoskeletal rearrangement and the release of neurotransmitters<sup>24,25</sup>. In particular, it has been reported that PLD has an important function in receptor-mediated endocytosis<sup>20</sup>. It has been reported that EGF (16 nM)-induced EGFR endocytosis occurred in a PLD activity-dependent manner in 3Y1 cells<sup>21</sup>. We also found that phosphatidic acid production induced by PLD activation was implicated in EGFR endocytosis at a high EGF concentrations (20 nM; data not shown). In this study, EGFR endocytosis was measured at a physiological EGF concentrations (0.2 nM). Moreover, as shown in Fig. 5b, EGFR endocytosis was recovered by adding wild-type PLDs or PLD<sup>KRm</sup>, but was not recovered by adding PLD1<sup>R128K</sup> or PLD1<sup>R197K</sup> in PLDs-silenced cells. Therefore, we suggest that the GAP effect of the PLD protein itself is crucial for EGFR endocytosis under physiological conditions, and that PLD activity is involved in the acceleration of EGFR endocytosis at high EGF concentrations.

Dynamin is a GTPase that is an important component of a wide variety of intracellular membrane trafficking events, including receptor-mediated endocytosis, synaptic vesicle recycling and the internalization of caveolae<sup>1,2,3</sup>. It has also been reported that dynamin functions as a primary regulator of the later stages of clathrin-coated vesicle budding in receptor-mediated endocytosis<sup>26</sup>. Dynamin is a multidomain protein that self-assembles into higher order structures resembling rings during endocytosis<sup>3</sup>. This self-assembly behaviour stimulates the GTPase activity of dynamin, due to the activation of intramolecular GED<sup>13</sup>. Therefore, in cases where dynamin-assembly behaviour is increased by templates (such as microtubules or acidic phospholipids) the GTPase activities of dynamin are significantly promoted in a sigmoidal fashion<sup>16,17</sup>. However, we have shown in this study that the GTPase activity of dynamin was linearly increased by the phox homology domain of PLDs in a dose dependent manner. Also we showed that when GTPase activity was measured using the GTPase domain without other domains involved in self-assembly (middle, pleckstrin homology, GED and PRD), increased GTPase activity of the GTPase domain by PLD1–PX was similar to that of the whole dynamin protein. Finally, PLD1–PX did increase the number of structures assembled from dynamin. Taken together, these data suggest that PLD–PX stimulates the GTPase activity of dynamin without promoting dynamin self-assembly. No intermolecular

dynamin in vivo remains unknown, we hypothesize a model for the effect of PLD in EGFR endocytosis based on our findings and previous reports (Fig. 5d). EGFR activation by EGF induces clathrin-coated pit formation through the recruitment of clathrin and clathrin-associated proteins (AP2, AP180, amphiphysin and Eps15). Dynamin is localized to clathrin-coated pits and this targeting is mediated by interactions between dynamin and proteins (clathrin-associated proteins) or lipid (PtdIns(4,5)P₂). The relocation of dynamin to the neck region of the

pit on the clathrin lattice is GTP dependent. GTP-loaded dynamin promotes dynamin self-assembly and PLD recruitment through an interaction between the dynamin-GTPase domain and PLD–PX. The recruited PLD then accelerates the GTPase activity of dynamin and potentiates EGFR endocytosis. We propose that PLD, in addition to its known phospholipase effects, acts as intermolecular GAP for dynamin through its phox homology domain.

### METHODS

#### Cell culture and transfection.
HEK293 cells were cultured at 37 °C in 5% CO₂ in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. For the transfection and transient expression of proteins, cells were transfected with Lipofectamine (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). HEK293 cells were transfected with synthetic siRNAs (20 nM duplex) specific for human PLDs: human PLD1 nucleotides 1455–1475 (AAGGUGGGACGACAAUGAGCA); human PLD2 sequences nucleotides 704–724 (AAGAGGUGGCGUGGUGGAAG) and nucleotides 1967–1987 (AAGGUGGGCGAUGAGAUUGUG). Transfections were performed using Lipofectamine (according to the manufacturer’s instructions) and then cultured for an additional 48 h to achieve PLD silencing²⁷. BLAST searching of all siRNA sequences revealed no significant homology to any other sequence in the database. Luciferase GL2 duplex (Dharmacon Research, Lafayette, CO) was used as a negative control. To restore the expression of PLDs, cells were transiently transfected with PLDs that resist siRNA silencing one day after being transfected with siRNA.

#### Plasmids.
The mammalian expression vectors for dynamin and the GTPase and phox homology domains of PLD1 were constructed by PCR. The amplified products were then inserted in-frame with pFLAG–CMV-2. The mutations of Arg 128, Arg 145, Arg 165 and Arg 197 to Lys (designated R128K, R145K, R165K and R197K) were introduced into the wild-type and into the phox homology domains of PLD1 cDNA by PCR-directed mutagenesis. Five functional dynamin domains (GTPase, Middle, pleckstrin homology, GTPase effector and proline-rich), deletion mutants of PLD1 (PLD1–PX-1 and PLD1–PX-2) and the PLD1–PX point mutants (R128K, R145K, R165K and R197K) were generated by PCR amplification and then subcloned into pGEX–4T2 plasmids.

#### Preparation of GST fusion proteins, dynamin and PLD.
Glutathione S-transferase (GST)-fused proteins containing the functional domains of dynamin and the phox homology domains (PLDs, p40<sup>phox</sup>, p47<sup>phox</sup>, FISH and KIAA0064) were constructed as previously described¹⁰. Recombinant proteins were purified from *Escherichia coli* strain, BL21, containing the appropriate constructs. Expression was then induced by adding IPTG (0.1 mM) at 25 °C for 4 h. After cells had been harvested, GST-fused proteins were purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Little Chalfont, UK), and then eluted with 50 mM glutathione reduced (GSH) at pH 7.0. Full-length dynamin was purified in rat brain as previously described²⁸, and full-length PLD was expressed in baculovirus infected Sf9 cells and purified as described previously²⁹.

#### Immunoprecipitation analysis.
Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (20 mM Tris–HCl at pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl₂, 1 mM EGTA, 1% Triton X-100 and 1% cholic acid) by sonication and the cell lysates obtained were centrifuged at 100,000g for 30 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were incubated with anti-PLD antibody or anti-FLAG antibody and the resulting immune complexes were washed three times with lysis buffer, separated by SDS–PAGE and immunoblotted.

#### In vitro binding analysis.
The in vitro bindings of dynamin, the GST-fused domains of dynamin, and PLD were analysed in 300 μl of lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 and 1% cholic acid at 4 °C for 3 h in the presence of 500 μM of GTP-γS or GDP-βS. After washing three times with binding buffer, samples were subjected to SDS–PAGE and then immunoblotted.

#### In vivo PLD activity assay.
PLD activities were assayed by measuring the formation of phosphatidylbutanol in the presence of 1-butanol, as previously described¹⁰. Briefly, HEK293 cells were serum starved for 20 h and then incubated with 10 μCi <sup>3</sup>H-myristic acid for 4 h. The unincorporated <sup>3</sup>H-myristic acid was then removed by two washings with serum-free DMEM, and the cells were treated with EGF in the presence of 0.4% 1-butanol. Reactions were halted by removing medium and adding 0.4 ml ice-cold methanol to each well. Cells were then scraped into a tube and 0.4 ml chloroform and 0.4 ml of 1 M NaCl were added. After vortexing, the tubes were centrifuged at 15,000g for 1 min, the organic phase was collected, dried and spotted onto Silica Gel 60 TLC plates, which were developed with chloroform–methanol–acetic acid (90/10/10 by vol.). The amounts of labelled phosphatidylbutanol and total lipids were determined using a Fuji BAS-2000 image analyzer (Tokyo, Japan). Results are expressed as phosphatidylbutanol spot counts and were normalized versus total lipid counts.

#### Receptor internalization assay.
Receptor internalization assays were conducted as previously described, with minor modification³⁰. Briefly, HEK293 cells were cultured to 60–70% confluence before adding EGF. Treated cells were briefly washed on ice with ice-cold PBS and then N-hydroxy-succinimide-biotin (1.5 mg ml⁻¹; Pierce, Rockford, IL) was added. The cells were then incubated with gentle agitation for 30 min at 4 °C, further incubated with 0.1 M glycine in PBS for 30 min at 4 °C (to quench any unreacted biotin before lysis) and lysed in lysis buffer (10 mM Tris at pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate and 1 mM EDTA). Biotinylated proteins were precipitated using streptavidin beads from equal amounts of cell lysates. The amounts of receptor bound to beads were determined by immunoblotting.

#### Fluorescence microscopy analysis.
HEK293 cells were treated with fluorescently-labelled rhodamine-conjugated EGF (Molecular Probe, Eugene, OR) on coverslips for the indicated periods. Cells were then washed in ice-cold Ca²⁺- and Mg²⁺-free phosphate-buffered saline and fixed with freshly-prepared 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma, St Louis, MO) for 30 min at 4 °C. Coverslips were then mounted into chambers and the cells were examined by confocal microscopy.

#### GTPase assay.
GTPase assays were conducted in assay buffer (20 mM piperazine-N,N9-bis(2-ethanesulfonic acid), 20 mM HEPES, 2 mM MgCl₂, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM DTT at pH 7.0, 0.25 mM GTP) containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin in a final volume of 20 μl. Dynamin (0.15 μM) was preincubated with the phox homology domains for 30 min at room temperature. Reactions were initiated by adding GTP (1 μCi α-<sup>32</sup>P-GTP). Aliquots (1.5 μl) were removed at specified times and spotted onto polyethyleneimine (PEI) cellulose thin-layer chromatography plates. Nucleotides were resolved by thin layer chromatography in 0.75 M KH₂PO₄ at pH 3.4. GTP and GDP were quantified at the specified times using a Fuji BAS-2000 Image Analyzer (Tokyo, Japan). Percentages of GTP hydrolysis were calculated for a minimum of five timepoints, and were defined as (GDP / (GTP + GDP)) × 100.

#### Sedimentation assay.
Dynamin (0.3 μM) was mixed with 1 μM GST, GST–PLD1–PX and GST–Grb2 in PH buffer. Mixtures were incubated for 10 min at room temperature and centrifuged at 13,000g for 15 min. Pellets were then resuspended in equal volumes as supernatants and aliquots of each were analysed by SDS–PAGE. Dynamin levels in pellets and supernatants were quantified by using a Fuji BAS-2000 Image Analyzer (Tokyo, Japan). Percentages of assembled dynamin were defined as (dynamin in pellet / (dynamin in pellet + dynamin in supernatant)) × 100.

Figure S1 Binding efficiency between PLD-PX and the GTPase domain of dynamin. (a) PLD1 was overexpressed in HEK 293 cells, and PLD was isolated using PLD antibody-coupled beads. PLD1 and indicated amounts of purified dynamin were incubated at 4 °C for 3 hours in the presence of GTPγS, and precipitated using PLD antibody-coupled beads. (b) Flag-tagged dynamin was overexpressed in HEK 293 cells, and dynamin was isolated using flag antibody-coupled beads. Dynamin and the indicated amounts of eluted GST-PLD1-PX were incubated at 4 °C for 3 hours in the presence of GTPγS, and precipitated using flag antibody-coupled beads. (c) Vector, Flag-tagged dynamin, or the GTPase domain of dynamin were overexpressed in HEK 293 cells. Dynamain and GTPase domain of dynamin were isolated using flag antibody-coupled beads. Dynamain and purified PLD1 or GTPase domain of dynamin and purified PLD1 were incubated at 4 °C for 3 hours in the presence of GTPγS, and precipitated using flag antibody-coupled beads. The resulting beads were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and western blots were probed using the appropriate antibodies.

**Figure S2** The GTPase activity of dynamin stimulated by PLD1-PX was more effective than that produced by stimulation with the Grb2 or GED domain of dynamin. (a) After preincubating PLD1-PX (1 μM) or Grb2 (1 μM) with dynamin for 30 minutes at room temperature, PLD1-PX was added, and allowed to react with [α]-³²P labeled GTP for 30 minutes at 37 °C. GTP and GDP were separated via TLC. Error bars represent mean ± standard deviation (n=2). (b) The indicated amounts of GST, GST-GED, or GST-PLD1-PX were preincubated with the GTPase domain of dynamin for 30 minutes at room temperature, and then allowed to react with [α]-³²P labeled GTP for 30 minutes at 37 °C. GTP and GDP were separated by TLC. Error bars represent mean ± standard deviation (n=2).

**Figure S3** Interaction between PLD and dynamin at a low EGF concentration (0.2 nM), and retardation of EGFR endocytosis via siRNA with multiple regions of PLDs. (a) PLD was transfected into HEK-293 cells, and after 24 hours of serum deprivation, the cells were treated with EGF (0.2 or 20 nM) for the indicated times. PLD was then immunoprecipitated using anti-PLD antibody. (b) Luciferase and PLDs were silenced by using siRNA (PLD1-A: nucleotides 1455 to 1475; PLD1-B: nucleotides 2976 to 2996, PLD2-A: nucleotides 704 to 724; PLD2-B: nucleotides 1967 to 1987) in HEK-293 cells. After 24 hours of serum deprivation, the endocytosis of biotinylated IR was assessed after treating cells with 0.2 nM EGF for 15 minutes. Error bars represent mean ± standard deviation (n=2).

Figure S4 The GAP function of PLD on dynamin during IR endocytosis.

(a) HEK 293 cells were cultured in 6 well plates. After 24 hours of serum deprivation, PBt formations in untreated (NT) or insulin-treated cells (for 5 min at the indicated concentrations) were assessed in the presence of 0.4% 1-butanol. Error bars represent mean ± standard deviation (n=2). (b) HEK 293 cells were cultured in 60 mm dishes. After 24 hours of serum deprivation, cells were treated with the indicated insulin concentrations.

The endocytosis of biotinylated IR after 5 minutes of insulin treatment was measured. Error bars represent mean ± standard deviation (n=2). (c) Luciferase and PLDs were silenced by using siRNA in HEK-293 cells, after which PLDs (WT, KRm, R128K, or R197K) were added. After 24 hours of serum deprivation, the endocytosis of biotinylated IR was assessed after treating cells with 0.1 nM insulin for 15 minutes. Error bars represent mean ± standard deviation (n=2).
