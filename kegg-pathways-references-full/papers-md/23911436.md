Christiaans SC, Wagener BM, Esmon CT, Pittet JF. Protein C and acute inflammation: a clinical and biological perspective. Am J Physiol Lung Cell Mol Physiol 305: L455–L466, 2013. First published August 2, 2013; doi:10.1152/ajplung.00093.2013.—The protein C system plays an active role in modulating severe systemic inflammatory processes such as sepsis, trauma, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) via its anticoagulant and anti-inflammatory properties. Plasma levels of activated protein C (aPC) are lower than normal in acute inflammation in humans, except early after severe trauma when high plasma levels of aPC may play a mechanistic role in the development of posttraumatic coagulopathy. Thus, following positive results of preclinical studies, a clinical trial (PROWESS) with high continuous doses of recombinant human aPC given for 4 days demonstrated a survival benefit in patients with severe sepsis. This result was not confirmed by subsequent clinical trials, including the recently published PROWESS-SHOCK trial in patients with septic shock and a phase II trial with patients with nonseptic ARDS. A possible explanation for the major difference in outcome between PROWESS and PROWESS-SHOCK trials is that lung-protective ventilation was used for the patients included in the recent PROWESS-SHOCK, but not in the original PROWESS trial. Since up to 75% of sepsis originates from the lung, aPC treatment may not have added enough to the beneficial effect of lung-protective ventilation to show lower mortality. Thus whether aPC will continue to be used to modulate the acute inflammatory response in humans remains uncertain. Because recombinant human aPC has been withdrawn from the market, a better understanding of the complex interactions between coagulation and inflammation is needed before considering the development of new drugs that modulate both coagulation and acute inflammation in humans.

THE PROTEIN C SYSTEM is best known for its anticoagulant activity seen most clearly in patients with total protein C deficiency that develop lethal thrombosis if not properly treated (32). The protein C system also has anti-inflammatory properties related both to its anticoagulant activity and to cytoprotective properties independent of the coagulation cascade. Because of these properties and following the purification of the activated form of protein C (aPC) from plasma (96), it was demonstrated that administration of aPC protected baboons from *Escherichia coli* sepsis (98). Alternatively, reducing protein C levels in mice or blocking its activation in baboons increased a sublethal to a lethal challenge with *E. coli* endotoxin or bacteria (38, 58, 98). In addition, because results from clinical studies support the concept that disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is an independent predictor of organ failure and mortality, there was strong evidence that strategies aimed at improving the coagulation status of patients with severe sepsis should be beneficial. The initial double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled multicenter clinical trial (PROW-

ESS) with a recombinant form of aPC (drotrecogin alfa activated) demonstrated a survival benefit in patients with severe sepsis (9). Following publication of these results, recombinant aPC was licensed for treatment of severe sepsis by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2001 and by the European Medicines Agency in 2002. Nevertheless, these initial positive results could not be replicated in septic patients with lower risk of death (ADDRESS study) or in children with severe sepsis (RESOLVE study) (1, 68). In 2011, drotrecogin alfa was withdrawn from the market worldwide after a new double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial (PROWESS-SHOCK) failed to meet its primary end point, i.e., a significant decrease in the 28-day mortality of patients with severe sepsis (72).

So, what is next regarding the role of the protein C system in acute inflammatory processes, such as severe sepsis, trauma, or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)? Could the administration of pharmacological doses of aPC given to select groups of patients and/or earlier in the course of the disease affect the outcome of these patients? The goal of this clinical perspective is to review the anticoagulant and cytoprotective properties of protein C and to summarize the most recent preclinical and clinical literature on the developing role of the protein C system in acute inflammation to determine whether

targeting the coagulation system could provide benefit to patients with severe sepsis and trauma.

### Anticoagulant and Cytoprotective Properties of Protein C

Protein C zymogen is a vitamin K-dependent protein secreted by the liver that has a plasma concentration of 40 nM with a half-life of 8 h. Upon binding with the endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR), thrombin-thrombomodulin complexes activate protein C by removing 14 amino acids (106). Generation of aPC from protein C depends on the presence of thrombin in plasma. Plasma concentration of aPC is low (less than 40 pM). However, the fact that the plasmatic clearance of aPC depends on serine protease inhibitors contributes to a long half-life of 20–25 min in humans. Activated protein C has known inhibitors in plasma that include protein C inhibitor, α₁-antitrypsin, α₂-macroglobulin, and α₂-antiplasmin (42) (Fig. 1).

One of the main functions of the protein C system is its anticoagulant activity. Upon its dissociation from EPCR, the anticoagulant activity of aPC involves proteolytic inactivation of coagulation factors Va and VIIIa (37), a mechanism that is enhanced by lipid and protein cofactors, such as protein S, sphingolipids, and high-density lipoproteins (42). It should be noted that, independent of its role as a cofactor for aPC, protein S also has a direct anticoagulant effect via its direct binding to factors Va and VIIIa and Xa (46). In addition, aPC also inactivates plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1), which results in increased fibrinolysis (69).

The protein C system also has cytoprotective properties related both to its anticoagulant activity and to inhibitory properties independent of the coagulation cascade. Thrombin generation can induce the expression of several proinflammatory events: for example, the expression of P-selectin or the activation of the NF-κB pathway (21). The initial PROWESS trial stimulated research on nonanticoagulant properties of aPC that lead to the elucidation of multiple cytoprotective properties of aPC that independent of its anticoagulant activity. The multiple cytoprotective effects of aPC include protection of the endothelial barrier function, antiapoptotic activity, anti-inflammatory properties, and modification of gene expression (Fig. 2). These cytoprotective effects of aPC are mediated by several receptors. The best known pathway is the EPCR-aPC-protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR1) pathway, which plays an important role in the barrier stabilization of endothelial cells via sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) and RAC1-dependent mechanisms as aPC causes EPCR-dependent transactivation of the S1P receptor in membrane lipid rafts (34). Interestingly, thrombin and aPC both bind to PAR1. However, to explain this paradox, recent work has shown that the localization of PAR1 in the caveolin-1 lipid rafts is required for aPC signaling, but not for thrombin activation of the receptor (82). In addition, thrombin-cleaved PAR1 is internalized whereas aPC-activated PAR1 stays at the cell membrane, which can prolong the aPC signaling via this receptor (92). The anti-inflammatory effect of aPC is also mediated on other cells by additional receptors other than PAR1. Integrins are important receptors for aPC on

Anticoagulant properties of activated protein C (aPC).** Protein C (PC) is activated after binding to endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR) at the endothelial surface via cleavage by thrombin. This cleavage happens in the presence of thrombin-thrombomodulin (TM) complexes. Activated protein C (aPC)'s major anticoagulant effect is inhibition of factors Va and VIIIa, which is accelerated by protein S, sphingolipids, and high-density lipoproteins (HDL). Its other anticoagulant effect is via inhibition of plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1), thereby promoting fibrinolysis. aPC activity is inhibited by protein C inhibitor, α₁-antitrypsin, α₂-macroglobulin, and α₂-antiplasmin. tPA, tissue plasminogen activator.

Fig. 2. Cytoprotective properties of aPC. aPC induces cytoprotective effects for the brain and kidney via the PAR3 receptor. Anti-inflammatory effects of aPC in immune cells are mediated by integrins. aPC activates the PAR-1-EPCR complex to produce sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), which binds its cognate receptor, causing activation of RAC1 to mediate endothelial barrier protection and antiapoptotic effects. These effects are further induced by activation of phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) by ApoER2-LDL8, which positively influences the S1P receptor. Finally, aPC can activate the PAR1 receptor when it is present in lipid rafts with caveolin-1. This interaction leads to receptor signaling remaining at the cell surface and promoting endothelial barrier protection and antiapoptotic effects. Conversely, when PAR1 is not in lipid rafts, it binds thrombin, which causes internalization and inactivation of the receptor and increase in endothelial permeability.

lymphocytes, neutrophils, and macrophages (42). PAR3 plays an important role in the cytoprotective effect of aPC in the brain and kidney (44, 50). Finally, the low-density lipoprotein-related protein 8 (ApoER2) binds aPC with great affinity and mediates aPC-induced activation of anti-inflammatory signaling pathways in U937 cells via a phosphoinositide-3-kinase-dependent mechanism (110). Taken together, these facts make it appear less and less likely that there is one unifying mechanism that explains all the cytoprotective properties of aPC. In contrast, the cytoprotective effects of aPC on different cells appear to be associated with cell-type-specific expression of aPC receptor complexes. This discovery had led to the development of aPC mutants that are only activating receptors on specific cell types, allowing a better understanding of the multiple anticoagulant and cytoprotective functions of aPC.

**Protein C and Sepsis**

Severe sepsis is defined as sepsis complicated by acute organ dysfunction. In severe sepsis caused by bacteria, fungus, or virus, dysregulation of the hemostatic system may lead to DIC associated with microvascular thrombosis, tissue hypoperfusion, multiorgan failure, and death (45). In animal models of severe sepsis, this characteristic sequence usually causes a procoagulant and antifibrinolytic state within a few hours after onset of the disease (52). In humans, the progression to a full DIC may be rapid or slow depending on the bacterial virulence and the patient’s underlying condition. If the patient survives, the restoration of the hemostatic balance will depend on individual protein synthesis capacity, stability of the synthesized coagulation enzymes and substrates, and efficacy of natural coagulation inhibitors. There are three principal natural anticoagulant pathways: tissue factor pathway inhibitor, which,

when bound to factor Xa, inhibits the tissue factor-factor VIIa complex, thus suppressing the initial steps of thrombin generation (17); antithrombin, which is a direct thrombin inhibitor forming complexes with thrombin (80); and protein C that is converted to its activated form (aPC) by proteolysis by the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex. After binding to its own receptor, EPCR, aPC acts as a potent inhibitor of thrombin via the inactivation of factors Va and VIIIa and also as a profibrinolytic agent by inhibiting plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 and thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (73).

Activation of the coagulation system may represent a potent mechanism of innate defense against bacterial invasion. The formation of fibrin network allows microbial trapping and limits bacterial growth. In addition, it facilitates the engagement of neutrophils, particularly via the recent description of the prothrombotic and antibacterial properties of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) (12, 59). The presence of histone proteins in these NETs also enhances platelet aggregation and impairs thrombomodulin (TM)-dependent activation of protein C, thus further activating the coagulation system (2). Although all procoagulant changes in severe human sepsis have been considered as pathological, this concept might have been erroneous. In septic DIC, some mediators such as fibrinogen or factor V are upregulated, whereas the hepatic synthesis of some anticoagulants such as antithrombin and protein C is significantly decreased (4). Thus not only may the decrease in plasma levels of protein C in severe sepsis represent consumption coagulopathy, but also the decrease in plasma levels of thrombin inhibitors and the fact that protein C is a negative acute-phase protein may be interpreted as participating in the host defense mechanisms. However, there are numerous clinical reports showing that excessive deregulation of hemostasis, including severely decreased plasma levels of protein C, occurs by 24 h after onset of the syndrome and is associated with multiorgan failure and death (28, 87). These observations suggest that administration of natural anticoagulants such as aPC may be of therapeutic value.

Because of the lack of causal therapy for severe sepsis in humans, and the positive results of a major study in septic primates with high dose of aPC, the first multicenter trial with a high dosage of aPC was organized (PROWESS trial). Importantly, the design of the trial stipulated that, irrespective of the time period of the sepsis, the type of bacteria, or the degree of activation of the coagulation system, every patient would receive the same high dose of aPC for a limited time (4 days). Administration of protein C zymogen was excluded because it was considered that its activation by thrombomodulin was dysfunctional in sepsis and thus unpredictable. Despite these shortcomings, PROWESS was stopped early because of a 6.1% absolute and a 19.4% relative reduction in mortality with a logical relation noted between severity of the disease and survival advantage (9). Soon after the publication of this study, new trials reported a lack of effect in patients with less severe sepsis or in children (1, 68). All subsequent clinical trials did not demonstrate that aPC would cause a significant decrease in mortality in patients with sepsis (Table 1). Because of these negative results and the cost of the drug, the European health authorities decided to request another randomized multicenter placebo-controlled trial to confirm the benefits reported in PROWESS. The results of PROWESS-SHOCK showed no difference in mortality between patients with septic shock treated with recombinant human aPC or placebo (72). This trial reported a mortality that was much lower (25%) than in other recent trials that also included patients with severe sepsis (35–50%) (23, 70) and raised the question of whether this trial was underpowered to detect a difference in mortality between the two groups of patients. Second, another possible explanation for the major difference in outcome between PROWESS and PROWESS-SHOCK trials is that lung-protective ventilation was used for the patients included in the recent PROWESS-SHOCK, but not in the original PROWESS trial. Since a large degree of sepsis originates from the lung, aPC treatment may not have added enough to the beneficial effect of lung-protective ventilation to show lower mortality. Finally, it also possible that defense mechanisms that locally attenuate the inflammatory response might be detrimental in the presence of systemic inflammation (85). The immediate consequence resulting from the lack of protection of aPC in patients included in the PROWESS-SHOCK trial was that the manufacturer of recombinant human aPC withdrew the drug from the market immediately after the publication of the results of this clinical trial.

Was this decision too abrupt? Are we sure that aPC does not work in sepsis? Since the publication of the first PROWESS trial, we have learned much more about the multiple functions of the protein C system including its nonanticoagulant properties. Some preclinical trials have shown that these nonanticoagulant and anti-inflammatory properties may have an important protective effect in sepsis (reviewed in Ref. 67). Furthermore, several propensity-matched cohort studies have suggested that early use of aPC in patients with septic shock was associated with reduced mortality (60, 75, 83). Another multicenter trial showed that the application of a bundle of measures could decrease mortality in severe sepsis and that the administration of aPC was by far the most significant of these measures (33). Finally, a recent analysis reviewed the published clinical work related to the effectiveness and safety of recombinant human aPC for the past 10 years and compared these results to the ones of the PROWESS and PROWESS-SHOCK trials. The results of this review that includes more than 45,000 patients with severe sepsis indicate that the relative risk of hospital mortality was reduced by 18% by treatment with aPC compared with controls, a reduction close to what was reported in the original PROWESS trial. Importantly, the overall benefit associated aPC treatment shows a 1.3% reduction in the relative risk of death for every 1% increase in control mortality, despite the fact that the risk of serious bleeding was higher than in the PROWESS trial (5.6 vs. 3.5%) (53). It should be pointed out that a major limitation of this meta-analysis is that only 10% of the patients included in that study were from randomized controlled trials. Taken together, it is possible that additional clinical studies might identify selected patients who could benefit from aPC or refine the therapeutic window to optimize its administration. However, the negative clinical trials done in follow-up of PROWESS may weaken enthusiasm for allocation of further funding and resources allocations to accomplish such trials. Additional preclinical studies may help identify clinically tractable strategies.

# Protein C and Trauma

There is new interest to understand the involvement of the protein C system in coagulation abnormalities after severe trauma in humans. Previous clinical studies have reported that a quarter of severely traumatized patients present with acute impairment of coagulation on arrival in the emergency department before any surgical treatment or administration of blood transfusion (14, 62). This early posttraumatic coagulopathy is physiologically and mechanistically distinct from classical iatrogenic posttraumatic coagulopathy associated with massive hemodilution, metabolic acidosis, and hypothermia. Importantly, this early posttraumatic coagulopathy is associated with higher blood transfusion requirements, a greater incidence of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, longer intensive care unit and hospital stays, and a fourfold increased risk of mortality compared with trauma patients without coagulation abnormalities at admission to the hospital (13, 18). These studies demonstrate that when traumatic injury is combined with tissue hypoperfusion (shock) the resultant early traumatic coagulopathy is characterized by elevated plasma levels of aPC and corresponding low levels of protein C zymogen, a decrease in factor V activity, and an activation of the fibrinolysis. These results raise two critical questions. First, what is the importance of the protein C system in the development of this early posttraumatic coagulopathy? The answer came from results of a mouse study demonstrating that severe hemorrhage and trauma caused severe coagulopathy associated with a fourfold increase in the plasma level of aPC. Inhibition of the anticoagulant domain of aPC by a blocking antibody to murine aPC completely corrected this early coagulopathy (15). However, aPC cytoprotective/anti-inflammatory functions play a key role in preventing death in this model, in part apparently by preventing excessive thrombosis that might result from tissue necrosis or apoptosis (15).

The second question is whether protein C activated by the binding of thrombin to thrombomodulin in the microcirculation during the early phase after trauma could have a protective effect against microvascular thrombosis in these patients. Recent clinical data from Cohen’s laboratory showed that release of aPC after severe trauma could mitigate sterile inflammation and organ injury induced by the extracellular release of histone proteins after severe injury (57). Similar results have been reported in an experimental model of sepsis. Indeed, a preclinical study from Dr. Esmon’s laboratory has demonstrated that extracellular histones released in response to inflammatory challenge contribute to endothelial dysfunction, organ failure, and death in a primate model of sepsis. Furthermore, coinfusion of aPC with *E. coli* prevented lethality in baboons by causing the cleavage of histones (108). Plasma levels of histone proteins either derived from apoptotic cells or secreted are known to have a strong prothrombotic effect by activating the procoagulant function of platelets associated with NETs (31) and by inducing plasma thrombin generation secondary to the impairment of TM-dependent aPC activation (2). Furthermore, the procoagulant effects of extracellular histones have recently been linked to signaling via platelet Toll-like receptors 2 (TLR2) and 4 (86). Plasma levels of histones were elevated in response to traumatic injury and correlated with fibrinolysis and activation of protein C. Elevated plasma levels of histones during the first 6 h after trauma were a multivariate predictor of mortality in this trauma patient population. However, when plasma levels of aPC were included in this multivariate analysis, the impact of histone level increase on mortality was abrogated (57). This data strongly suggests that elevated aPC levels may have a protective effect by cleaving histones. However, a large increase in plasma levels of aPC early after severe trauma may represent a maladaptive response to an important protective mechanism against microvascular thrombosis after severe trauma in humans (Fig. 3).

The massive activation of protein C that causes early coagulopathy after severe trauma is followed in some patients with depletion of this system characterized by low plasma levels of both protein C zymogen and aPC (18, 19). These patients are known to later develop a hypercoagulable state and have a higher risk for thrombosis and nosocomial infections including bacterial pneumonia (55). In one study, trauma patients who subsequently developed infections had normal white blood cell count and functional coagulation profile 24 h after admission but showed depletion of protein C and increased levels of plasmin-antiplasmin complexes. These coagulation system derangements characterize a patient group with normal hemostatic profile by thromboelastometry, but potentially abnormal immunocompetence at increased risk for nosocomial pneumonia. Indeed, lower plasma levels of protein C zymogen were correlated with higher rates of both gram-positive and gram-negative infections and longer hospital stay (19). Whether there is a causal relationship between low plasma levels of aPC observed hours after trauma-induced activation of this pathway and the later development of nosocomial pneumonia is not fully understood. In addition, it is unclear whether it is the anticoagulant and/or the anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective activity of aPC that is responsible for a possible protective effect of aPC against bacterial infection. A previous study from Dr. Esmon’s laboratory has shown that the cytoprotective but not the anticoagulant activity of endogenous aPC plays an important role in sepsis, as blocking the cytoprotective domain of aPC caused lethality after injection of a sublethal dose of *E. coli* endotoxin (107). Furthermore, a study from our laboratory has shown that treatment with aPC or its nonanticoagulant mutant significantly attenuated lung injury caused by *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* in mice (11). In that study, we found that this wild-type aPC or its mutant protected the lung endothelial barrier against injury caused by *P. aeruginosa* by preventing the activation of the small GTPase RhoA by this bacterium. In another study, we have also shown that RhoA activation plays an important role in the *P. aeruginosa*-mediated increase in PAI-1 that itself also increases RhoA activation (41) and is a marker of poor outcome in patients with *P. aeruginosa* pneumonia (93). These results indicate that the anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective activity of aPC might play a predominant role in the protection provided by aPC against injury caused by bacterial products, although additional work is needed to fully understand the causal relationship between posttraumatic coagulation derangements and development of nosocomial lung infection (Fig. 3).

The parallels between mechanisms of pathogen-induced sepsis and those underlying the sterile inflammatory response to trauma are becoming more evident, suggesting that insights and therapies from the critical care and sepsis literature may be applicable earlier in the hospital course of the acutely injured trauma patient. Future studies are warranted to identify drivers

of both early coagulopathy induced by protein C and later depletion of the protein C system. From this knowledge, putative future clinical intervention could involve blocking the anticoagulant domain of aPC early after trauma, which would correct the early posttraumatic coagulopathy, while maintaining its cytoprotective effect that is critical for the homeostasis of the vascular endothelium. Furthermore, there is a possibility that administration of aPC, possibly a mutant that does not have the anticoagulant effect of the wild-type protein, to correct trauma-induced depletion of protein C may protect against development of later lung infection and represent a putative biological link between the coagulation cascade and later infectious complications in these patients.

### Protein C and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome

Bronchoalveolar lavage of patients with ARDS reveals increasing activation of the coagulation system with intra-alveolar generation of thrombin and inhibition of fibrinolysis that correlates with the severity of the inflammation (36, 43). These coagulation disturbances are largely mediated by the tissue factor-factor VIIa pathway, since inhibition of this pathway prevents intra-alveolar fibrin deposition (66). There is also reduction of the natural anticoagulant activity within the alveolar space characterized by decreased levels of protein C and increased levels of soluble thrombomodulin secondary to shedding and oxidation of this protein that correlate with poor outcome in ARDS patients (102). Furthermore, despite enhanced production of intra-alveolar fibrin, fibrinolytic activity is depressed in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of patients with ARDS because of high levels of PAI-1, the main inhibitor of fibrinolysis. Elevated levels of PAI-1 in the pulmonary fluid of patients with ARDS are also associated with higher mortality in this patient population (71). Extensive cross talk between coagulation and inflammation may further damage the lungs because activated coagulation factors may cause impairment of the alveolar aeration and perfusion and promote lung fibrosis. Despite these results, clinical trials, except for one small recently published study (20), have not shown beneficial effects with systemic administration of aPC in patients with ARDS. Results from the original PROWESS trial suggested that patients with a pulmonary origin for sepsis benefited more from the systemic administration of aPC than other groups of patients included in his trial (9). Because of these results, Dr. Matthay's group (61) performed a new clinical trial with ARDS patients from nonseptic origin. The results showed that recombinant human aPC decreased pulmonary dead-space fraction in these patients, but without improvement in the clinical outcome. Although the reasons for this lack of effect of aPC in this recent trial are not clear, it is possible that in some ARDS patients, for example those with bacterial pneumonia, activation of the coagulation within the air spaces may provide protection against a widespread dissemination of the bacteria.

TRAUMA

EARLY PHASE  
Plasma: High aPC, low PC  
1. Protection against shock-induced microvascular thrombosis  
2. Cleavage of circulating histones (antiinflammatory)  
3. Systemic anticoagulation (maladaptive response)

LATE PHASE  
Plasma: Low aPC, low PC  
1. Prothrombotic milieu  
2. Decreased endothelial barrier protection  
3. Increased risk for nosocomial infection  

Fig. 3. Roles of the protein C pathway after severe trauma. There is a massive activation of the protein C pathway in 20–25% of the patients early after severe trauma that is secondary to the intravascular formation of thrombin within the microcirculation. aPC activation is important to maintain blood flow within the microcirculation and to cleave circulating histones. However, the massive activation of aPC is also associated with an early coagulopathy that is seen as a maladaptive response to a physiological mechanism that protects against microvascular thrombosis. Severe trauma is associated with the development of a prothrombotic milieu within a few days after injury. Some patients do not recover a physiological plasma level of aPC after the early activation of this pathway. These patients are at higher risk for microvascular thrombosis and development of nosocomial pneumonia.

PROTEIN C, SEPSIS, TRAUMA, AND ARDS

Indeed, two experimental studies have shown that the systemic administration of high doses of aPC aggravated the lung injury associated by *P. aeruginosa* pneumonia in rodents (16, 79). Furthermore, recent clinical trials with other anticoagulants did not provide survival benefit for ARDS patients (51, 105), raising the hypothesis that in some ARDS patients for whom anticoagulation could be beneficial, high pulmonary concentrations of aPC may not be achieved with systemic treatment without causing serious systemic bleeding.

Local administration of anticoagulants via nebulization may be an alternative to deliver higher pulmonary concentrations of these drugs while possibly preventing systemic bleeding. Small clinical trials tested the effect of nebulized heparin in patients with ARDS (29, 65). In one trial, the combination of heparin, N-acetylcysteine, and albuterol improved survival and lung injury score (65). This was a trial including patients with smoke inhalation-induced injury, which is characterized by large airway clots as a prominent feature of the model. Thus the beneficial effects may have largely related to the inhibition of the precipitation of fibrin in the bronchial tree rather than alveolar injury. Although there is no published clinical trial that includes the administration of aPC via nebulization in patients with ARDS, preclinical studies with nebulized recombinant aPC reported that this mediator attenuated the activation of coagulation and inhibition of fibrinolysis in experimental models of ARDS while improving oxygenation without systemic bleeding (48, 49, 56, 90). However, nebulization of aPC inconsistently reduced lung inflammation in these preclinical models of ARDS, although the dose of nebulized aPC used in these preclinical studies was in the same range as the dose of aPC used in clinical studies, if we take into account the inefficiency of the nebulization process. In summary, these preclinical studies suggest that the local administration of recombinant aPC is safe. However, several important questions need to be answered before aPC could be considered as a potential local treatment for ARDS. First, the correct aPC dosage for nebulization is not really known because the maximal dose of aPC used in humans was established by toxicology and substantive refinements to optimize lung bioavailability may be problematic; second, it is not clear whether the potential protective effect of aPC is related to its anticoagulant or anti-inflammatory properties. Additional studies performed with the proper aPC mutants may help to respond to this important question.

**Conclusion**

In summary, the protein C system appears to play a major role in modulating severe acute inflammation via its anticoagulant and anti-inflammatory properties. However, the mechanisms of action of aPC in modulating the acute inflammatory response are only partially understood. Thus more basic science work will be required to have a full understanding of how the protein C system modulates the acute inflammation associated with sepsis, trauma, or ARDS. Plasma levels of aPC are lower than normal in acute inflammation, with the exception of the early time period after severe trauma when high plasma levels of aPC may play a mechanistic role in the development of early posttraumatic coagulopathy. Following positive results of preclinical studies, a clinical trial (PROWESS) with high continuous doses of recombinant aPC given for a limited period of time demonstrated a significant decrease in mortality compared with placebo in patients with severe sepsis. This survival benefit from aPC treatment was not confirmed by subsequent clinical trials. The results of recently published PROWESS-SHOCK trial with patients that included septic shock were also negative. A lack of survival benefit was also observed in a large clinical trial that included patients with nonseptic ARDS. In contrast, a recent meta-analysis of 45,000 patients treated for severe sepsis with aPC during the last 10 years (including PROWESS and PROWESS-SHOCK patients) suggests an overall survival benefit for aPC treatment in severe sepsis. Despite the results of this meta-analysis, whether aPC will continue to be used to modulate the acute inflammatory response in humans remains uncertain. With the withdrawal of aPC (also called drotrecogin alfa activated) from the market immediately after the publication of the negative results of the PROWESS-SHOCK trial, there is currently no recombinant aPC available for clinical use in humans. Because of the technical difficulty to produce this drug and the fact that European and American health authorities would require at least two large phase III clinical trials before a new form of aPC could be licensed for marketing, it would be difficult and costly for any manufacturer to bring a new form of aPC on the market.
