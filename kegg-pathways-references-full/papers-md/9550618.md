cal manifestations and morbidity of 66 patients with hyponatremia (12). (a) 21 out of 52 patients were diuretic users. (b) Morbidity was as high as 50% in patients with acute hyponatremia. (c) Mortality was 12% in the hyponatremic patients with manifest symptoms. Measures to prevent hyponatremia is warranted, and development of solute free-water diuresis (aquaretics) have long been expected.

### Action of aquaretics

Aquaretics antagonize vasopressin in V2 receptors. Nonpeptide V2 antagonists are preferable compared to peptide V2 antagonists. OPC-31260 is a novel, nonpeptide, selective V2 receptor antagonist developed in Japan (13–15). OPC-31260 increases the first 6-hour hypotonic urine volume dose-dependently (Fig. 2) (15). In an early second phase of clinical trial, OPC-31260 30 mg/day was administered to 99 edema patients for 7 days. A significant decrease in urine osmolality and body weight and a significant increase in urine volume were observed. Urinary sodium excretion was not affected. A significant increase in serum Na concentration was observed in patients with hepatic edema. Application of OPC-31260 is expected to expand with the proper adjustment of dosage, and with establishment of the methods of co-administering loop diuretics.

### Future of aquaretics

Vasopressin V2 receptor has already been cloned (16, 17). Their mutations have been linked to various types of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (18). Elucidation of the mechanisms of binding of vasopressin or its antagonists to vasopressin V2 receptors is expected to open the way to further development of aquaretics.

### Conclusion

Diuretics will remain a mainstay of treatment for cardiac, renal, or hepatic edema. Here, the treatment of loop diuretic-resistant edema, and the theory, development, and usage of aquaretics were briefly reviewed.

Mechanisms of acid secretion and bicarbonate absorption by renal tubules

The kidney is the main organ to secrete acid which is loaded into the body by daily food intake. The kidney also supplies bicarbonate to compensate for the consumed bicarbonate for buffering the acid (1). In the kidney, cortical to medullary collecting ducts play major roles in the acid-base regulation. Proximal convoluted tubules are important to reabsorb bicarbonate ion which is filtered by glomerulus.

Mechanisms of acid secretion and bicarbonate supply by collecting ducts

In the collecting ducts, there are two kinds of cells; the principal cells, which play important roles in the regulation of Na⁺, K⁺, and water, and the intercalated cells, which play major roles in the acid-base homeostasis. The intercalated cells are further divided into two types, α- and β-intercalated cells (Fig. 1). It is conceivable that the α-intercalated cells secrete hydrogen ion and that the β-intercalated cells secrete bicarbonate.

The basic knowledge of the transport mechanisms by these cells is very important to understand the acid-base homeostasis in the body.

The α-intercalated cells play the most important role in acid secretion. The mechanisms of acid secretion in this type of cell are shown in Fig. 1. The carbon dioxide, which is generated in the cells enters from the blood, is changed to carbonic acid by carbonic anhydrase IV. This carbonic acid is divided into hydrogen ion and bicarbonate ion by a non-enzymatic pathway. The hydrogen ion is secreted into the lumen by the luminal H⁺-ATPase. The bicarbonate ion is transported to the blood side by the anion exchanger type 1 (band 3 protein). Anion exchanger type 1 is abundant in red blood cells; it has been reported that the mutation of this transporter gene results in hemolytic anemia and metabolic acidosis in cattle (2). This finding provides a manifestation that anion exchanger is important to keep acid-base homeostasis.

In addition to vacuolar type H⁺-ATPase, there is a possibility that H⁺-K⁺-ATPase may exist in the intercalated cells of rats and rabbits. This H⁺-K⁺-ATPase is essential to produce gastric juice in the stomach, and the inhibitor for this ATPase is widely used for the treatment of peptic ulcer. It is not clear whether H⁺-K⁺-ATPase in the α-intercalated cells is the same protein as that in the stomach. It is reasonable, however, that functionally similar ATPase is present in the kidney, although H⁺-K⁺-ATPase plays a role in potassium reabsorption under the hypokalemic state.

In the β-intercalated cells, the H⁺-ATPase is present on the basolateral membrane and the anion exchanger is localized on the luminal membrane. This localization of transporters is a mirror-image of the α-intercalated cells and results in bicarbonate ion secretion and hydrogen ion reabsorption. It is not clear whether the anion exchanger on the luminal membrane of the β-intercalated cells is the same type of anion exchanger as that of the α-intercalated cells, although it has been shown that the luminal anion exchanger is not stained by the specific antibody to type 1.

Several factors are involved in the regulation of acid secretion by the collecting ducts; acid loading, alkalosis and acidosis, and mineralocorticoids. The in vivo acid loading stimulates acid secretion and transporter activities in the α-intercalated cells by unknown mechanisms. It has been reported that respiratory acidosis and alkalosis respectively up-regulate and down-regulate the acid secretion by the β-intercalated cells, respectively. Aldosterone, which is secreted from the glomerular zone of the adrenal cortex, is the most important humoral factor in the regulation of the intercalated cells. In the intercalated cells, aldosterone binds to the specific mineralocorticoid receptor, and stimulates luminal H⁺-ATPase. The mineralocorticoid receptor is present in the principal and intercalated cells. In the principal cells, aldosterone stimulates Na⁺ reabsorption and K⁺ secretion. This action is very specific for aldosterone, while the mineralocorticoid receptor has a similar affinity for aldosterone and cortisol. The specificity of aldosterone on the target cells is caused by glucocorticoid metabolizing enzyme, 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11 OHSD), which rapidly me-

tabolizes cortisol to an inactive substance. The specific inhibitor for this enzyme is glycyrrhizic acid, which is commonly used for the treatment of hepatitis in Japan. By administration of glycyrrhizic acid, 11 OHSD is inhibited and cortisol can bind to the mineralocorticoid receptor, exerting the so-called mineralocorticoid action, hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, and hypertension. In addition, mutation of the gene of 11 OHSD is proven to be associated with apparent mineralocorticoid excess syndrome (3), which shows similar characteristics to excessive ingestion of glycyrrhizic acid.

**Mechanisms of bicarbonate reabsorption by proximal convoluted tubules**

The proximal convoluted tubules reabsorb bicarbonate ion which is filtered by the glomerulus (Fig. 2). The filtered bicarbonate ion is coupled with hydrogen ion, which is supplied by Na⁺-H⁺-exchanger on the luminal membrane, by carbonic anhydrase II. The importance of carbonic anhydrase II was proven by the report stating that gene mutation of this enzyme causes metabolic acidosis (4). The produced carbonic acid by this enzyme is cleaved to water and carbon dioxide, non-enzymatically, and carbon dioxide enters into the cells. This carbon dioxide is metabolized by carbonic anhydrase IV to bicarbonate ion and hydrogen ion. The bicarbonate ion is reabsorbed by the sodium-independent anion exchanger and electrogenic Na⁺-HCO₃⁻-cotransporter. The hydrogen ion is secreted to the lumen by Na⁺-H⁺-exchanger. The reabsorption of bicarbonate ion by the proximal convoluted tubules is regulated by the in vivo acid and alkali loading, parathyroid hormone, dopamine, cortisol, insulin, and various growth factors. Fine regulation of the acid-base balance, however, is maintained by the collecting ducts.

**Recent findings in the pathogenesis of metabolic acidosis and alkalosis**

**Renal tubular acidosis**

Renal tubular acidosis (RTA) is classified as types 1, 2, and 4. With basic knowledge of the physiology of the acid-base balance in the kidney, two clinical cases and one clinical study, which have been reported by our group, provide new insight for the understanding of the pathophysiology of acid-base disorders.

RTA type 1 is also called the classic type or distal type and is conceivably caused by the impairment of acid secretion by distal tubules. Several hypotheses have been proposed for the pathogenesis of RTA type 1. Recently, two interesting cases have been reported. One case was reported by Cohen et al (5). That case presented RTA type 1, accompanied with Sjögren's syndrome. A biopsy sample from the patient was devoid of any anti-H⁺-ATPase staining in the intercalated cells. In this case, it was suggested that the absence of H⁺-ATPase caused RTA type 1 and this case also provided a clue that H⁺-ATPase is important in the acid secretion of the kidney.

Another case was reported by us (6). The patient showed RTA type 1 with a 3-year history of Grave’s disease. With the patient’s serum, we performed fluorescent immunocytochemistry. Certain cells in the normal kidney were stained and those cells were considered to be intercalated cells based on their distribution and morphology. Double staining with the patient’s serum and peanut lectin, which is a marker of β-

intercalated cells, was performed and that study showed that the patient's serum contains auto-antibody to both types of intercalated cells. Further characterization of antibody was not performed, although this auto-antibody to the intercalated cells plays an important role in the pathogenesis of RTA type 1.

Patients with RTA type 4 shows metabolic acidosis with hyperkalemia; clinically, it is often accompanied with diabetic nephropathy. As a genetic disorder, pseudohypoaldosteronism I and II are known to cause type 4 RTA. In patients with hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism, the decreased secretion of renin from the juxtaglomerular cells results in hypoaldosteronism. In this disorder, secretion of glucocorticoid is normal; therefore, inhibition of 11 OHSD should induce the binding of cortisol on the mineralocorticoid receptor and ameliorate type 4 RTA. Eight patients of hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism were orally given glycyrrhizinic acid for up to 3 months. As shown in Fig. 3, hyperkalemia and metabolic acidosis were returned to within the normal range in one month. This result clearly revealed the importance of 11 OHSD.

Recently, the cause of pseudohypoaldosteronism I has been reported (7) (Table 1). In this genetic disorder, it was shown that the mutation of the gene of the amiloride-sensitive Na⁺ channel is linked to the phenotype of the disease. This mutation causes the diminished function of the Na⁺ channel and decreases sodium reabsorption by the collecting ducts. Increased Na⁺ in the lumen results in the decreased H⁺ secretion because of unfavorable electrochemical gradient.

- Gitelman’s syndrome: gene mutation in Na⁺-Cl⁻-cotransporter (ref. 10)

Metabolic alkalosis

There is no case report stating that hyperfunction of proximal tubular cells or intercalated cells is the primary reason for metabolic alkalosis. Recently, however, three genetic disorders with metabolic alkalosis have been proved to be caused by gene mutation of transporter or 11 OHSD.

Bartter’s syndrome is a well-known disorder with hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis. In the inherited form of Bartter’s syndrome, it was reported that gene mutation of Na⁺-K⁺-2Cl⁻-cotransporter is linked to the phenotype of the disorder (8). Hypofunction of this transporter induces an increase in Na⁺ delivery to the collecting duct. In the collecting ducts, increased Na⁺ delivery induces the increase in Na⁺ reabsorption, which,

in turn, is favorable for H⁺ and K⁺ secretion. It was also shown that gene mutation of K⁺ channel causes Bartter's syndrome (9). Gitelman’s syndrome is a variant of Bartter’s syndrome; it is known to accompany hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, and, in addition, hypocalciuria. This disorder is proven to link to the gene mutation of Na⁺-Cl⁻-cotransporter (10). The cause of hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis is similar to Bartter’s syndrome.

As mentioned above, with the accumulation of basic knowledge on renal physiology, the pathophysiology of not only the diseases in acid-base balance but also the other electrolyte disorders is being elucidated.

## 5. A Functional Role for Endogenous Atrial Natriuretic Peptide in the Maintenance of Body Fluid Balance in Heart Failure

**Key words:** heart failure, atrial natriuretic peptide, natriuretic peptide receptor antagonist, endothelin receptor antagonist, angiotensin II receptor antagonist

### Introduction

Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) is secreted in response to atrial stretch and increases sodium excretion, inhibits the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone, sympathetic activity and endothelin release. These vasoconstrictive neurohormones decrease renal blood flow, retain body fluid and aggravate heart failure. Recently, studies using a novel natriuretic peptide receptor antagonist have demonstrated a role for endogenous receptor ANP in cardiorenal homeostasis in normal and heart failure conditions (1–3). The importance of ANP, however, in the regulation of hormonal and renal function in heart failure remains controversial. Our previous studies have shown that the vasodilatory effects of ANP appear to be attenuated in advanced heart failure, suggesting the down-regulation of ANP receptors in vascular beds (4). Recent clinical studies have demonstrated that ANP infusion to patients with heart failure is effective, although the response is less sensitive with regard to the renal, hormonal and hemodynamic changes compared with normal control subjects (5–7).

The objective of the current study was to establish the functional roles of endogenous ANP in regulating renal and neurohumoral function by investigating ANP suppression, endothelin and angiotensin II suppression in a canine model with heart failure.
