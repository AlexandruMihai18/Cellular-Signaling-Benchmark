Abstract

A major function of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways is to control eukaryotic gene expression programmes in response to extracellular signals. MAPKs directly control gene expression by phosphorylating transcription factors. However, it is becoming clear that transcriptional regulation in response to MAPK signaling is more complex. MAPKs can also target coactivators and corepressors and affect nucleosomal structure by inducing histone modifications. Furthermore, multiple inputs into individual promoters can be elicited by MAPKs by targeting different components of the same coregulatory complex or by triggering different events on the same transcription factor. “Postgenomic approaches” are beginning to impact on our understanding of these gene regulatory networks. In this review, we summarise the current knowledge of MAPK-mediated gene regulation, and focus on how complexities in signaling outcomes are achieved and how this relates to physiological processes.

1. Introduction

The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways play important roles in regulating gene expression in eukaryotic cells. One of the major mechanisms for effecting changes in gene expression appears to be through MAPKs altering the activity of transcription factors and hence the transcription of their cognate target genes. Indeed, the growing importance of this topic is demonstrated from a PubMed search which identified >800 publications in 2002 when entering the key words “MAP kinase” and “transcription factor”. Numerous mammalian transcription factors and their coregulatory proteins have been identified as targets of the different MAPK cascades (Table 1). Further examples can be found in transcriptional regulatory proteins from diverse eukaryotic organisms including yeasts, worms and insects. Here we review the basic underlying principles of MAP kinase signaling to the nucleus and the major advances that have occurred in the field in recent years. We concentrate on findings derived from mammalian systems but use examples from model organisms to illustrate important principles. Particular focus is given to the complexities of signaling processes and the resulting transcriptional output that is exemplified by the direct involvement of coactivators and corepressors in these cascades.

terminal kinase (JNK), p38, and extracellular signal regulated kinase-5 [ERK5; also called Big MAP kinase-1 (BMK1)] (reviewed in Lewis et al., 1998; Kyriakis and Avruch, 2001) (Fig. 1). These groups contain a number of gene products and additional isoforms are generated by alternative splicing of the pre-mRNAs. For example, 10 JNK isoforms are expressed in cells and these are derived from three *Jnk* genes (*Jnk1*, *Jnk2*, *Jnk3*) (Gupta et al., 1996). ERK is mainly activated by mitogenic stimuli such as growth factors and hormones, while JNK and p38 are predominantly activated by stress stimuli (reviewed in Lewis et al., 1998; Kyriakis and Avruch, 2001). ERK5 is activated by both stress stimuli and growth factors (Kyriakis and Avruch, 2001). MAPKs are components of signaling pathways that feature a core triple kinase cascade. The MAPKs are activated by phosphorylation on Thr and Tyr by dual-specificity MAP kinase kinases (MAPKK), which in turn are activated by Ser/Thr phosphorylation by MAP kinase kinase kinases (MAPKKK) (reviewed in Lewis et al., 1998; Kyriakis and Avruch, 2001) (Fig. 1). Upstream of MKKKs, additional protein kinases may participate (e.g. Ste20-related protein kinases) and also members of the Ras and Rho families of small GTPases (Lewis et al., 1998; Kyriakis and Avruch, 2001). Efficient signal transduction by MAPK cascades requires that the components of the cascade are colocalised within the cell. This can occur by the direct physical association of the components with each other or by their binding to scaffold proteins (Whitmarsh and Davis, 1998). It is possible that alternative pathways distinct from the kinase cascades described above can contribute to MAPK activities. For example, the binding of the regulatory protein TAK1-binding protein-1 (TAB1) to p38α leads to autophosphorylation of the regulatory Thr and Tyr residues of p38α and increased protein kinase activity (Ge et al., 2002).

Once activated, MAPKs can directly phosphorylate proteins containing the minimal phosphoacceptor motif Ser/Thr-Pro. Phosphorylation can take place in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus and many of their targets are transcription factors or transcriptional coregulators. In addition, MAPKs phosphorylate and activate downstream protein kinases. These protein kinases include the Ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK), MAPK-interacting kinase (MNK), MAPK-activated protein kinase (MAPKAP), and mitogen-and stress-activated protein kinase (MSK) families (Fig. 1), many of which regulate gene expression through phosphorylation of histones and transcriptional regulatory proteins (reviewed in Lewis et al., 1998; Kyriakis and Avruch, 2001).

### 3. The importance of docking interactions with substrates

In addition to the minimal MAP kinase phosphoacceptor recognition sequence Ser/Thr-Pro, it is becoming increasingly clear that in many cases additional determinants are required to specify a MAP kinase substrate. These regions are known as docking domains (reviewed in Sharrocks et al., 2000; Enslen and Davis, 2001). Typically, there are two types of docking domains. The classical docking domains or D-domains are characterised by the presence of a cluster of basic residues followed by a LxL motif and/or a hydrophobic triplet (Fig. 2A). Depending on their sequence, these motifs can specify phosphorylation by one or a subset of MAP kinases from different functional classes by serving to recruit the kinase and enhance substrate phosphorylation. A second type of docking motif is a short peptide containing the sequence FxF that is typically located downstream from the phosphoacceptor motifs. This motif was originally thought to be specific to the ERK subfamily but can also enhance substrate phosphorylation by p38α and p38β2 (Jacobs et al., 1999; Galanis et al., 2001). Again, the FxF motif not only promotes MAPK interactions and the efficiency of phosphorylation but, importantly, also appears to enable the MAPK to discriminate amongst multiple phosphoacceptor motifs. For example, in Elk-1, the FxF motif is responsible for directing preferential phosphorylation of the critical Ser383 residue (Fantz et al., 2001). Substrates can contain either a D-domain or FxF motif or often contain both (Fig. 2C) (Jacobs et al., 1999; reviewed in Sharrocks et al., 2000). This can provide further specificity of kinase action. Further complexities can be demonstrated from studies on Net/SAP-2 that contains two D-domains, one specifying phosphorylation by the ERK subfamily and one by the JNK subfamily (Ducret et al., 2000). By “mixing and matching” these docking domains, it is thus possible to generate a large number of possible different substrate specificities.

Recently, structural information has been gathered on the structure of the D-domains by studies on complexes of p38

These peptides bind in an extended conformation along a surface exposed groove on the kinase that is distinct from the active site of the enzyme (Fig. 2B). Binding of the peptides induces a structural change in the kinase that may be linked to its activation. The interactions made by the basic region of the D-domain in MEF2 are not clearly visible in the structure, but the hydrophobic triplet forms major interactions with the binding groove. It is likely that other D-domains also follow a similar trajectory on the surface of other MAP kinases but it is currently unclear where the FxF motif will dock on the MAPKs.

Recently, novel types of docking domains have been identified that differ from the D-domain and FxF motif described above. The best example of this is in the ETS-domain transcription factors Ets-1 and Ets-2, where the pointed domain has been shown to contain a surface-exposed ERK MAP kinase docking motif that differs from either of the previously described docking domains ([Seidel and Graves, 2002]). Secondly, ERK5 has been shown to associate with MEF2 but binding occurs through the MADS/MEF DNA-binding domain in this case ([Yang et al., 1998, Kasler et al., 2000]). In these interactions, it is the unique C-terminal region of ERK5 rather than its conserved catalytic domain that makes these interactions. It remains possible that additional interactions may be observed between the catalytic domain and the classical docking motif found in MEF2 ([Yang et al., 1999a]).

In addition to docking sites that act in *cis*, it is also possible that such domains might act in *trans*. An extension of this mode of action would be the use of an adapter protein to recruit the MAPK to substrates (Fig. 2D). Docking in *trans* can occur within heterodimeric combinations of Jun family proteins where docking of MAPKs occurs on one monomer but phosphorylation occurs on the other ([Kallunki et al., 1996]). A similar scenario is suggested by the observation that the phosphorylation of the Drosophila transcription factors Yan and Pointed is dependent on the binding of the adapter protein Mae ([Baker et al., 2001]). Mae binds to these proteins through interactions between their respective pointed domains. It is not clear whether this interaction directly triggers ERK recruitment through Mae or whether an allosteric change is triggered in Yan and Pointed that permits their phosphorylation. Nevertheless, the possibility exists that additional *trans*-acting MAPK docking domains might exist. A further potential extension of this type of docking interaction is that entire or subsets of MAPK modules might be tethered directly to transcription factors, permitting direct communication between the kinases and the transcription factor substrates. Such a situation is hinted at by a recent study on the scaffold

protein JLP, which demonstrated that this could bind to components of the JNK and p38 cascades and also to Myc and Max transcription factors (Lee et al., 2002a). Similarly, a scaffold-like protein in Drosophila, CKA, was identified that could link components of the JNK signaling pathway (HEP/DJNKK and BSK/DJNK) to the transcription factors DFOS and DJUN (Chen et al., 2002a). Direct functional consequences were observed in this case and JNK-mediated DFOS/DJUN phosphorylation is promoted by CKA. It appears likely that other complex docking interactions between transcription factors and the upstream MAPK cascades exist.

## 4. Regulation of transcription factor function

The phosphorylation of transcription factors by MAPK signaling pathways regulates their activities in a number of ways including (i) their intracellular location, (ii) their protein levels, (iii) their binding to DNA, and (iv) their interactions with regulatory proteins (summarised in Fig. 3).

### 4.1. Intracellular localisation

Many transcription factors permanently reside in the nucleus but others shuttle between the cytoplasm and the nucleus. MAPK signaling pathways can either stimulate the translocation of transcription factors to the nucleus to promote their activity or conversely, stimulate the export of transcription factors from the nucleus and hence facilitate their inactivation. Nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of proteins is an active process in which the nuclear import and export machinery recognise nuclear localisation signals (NLSs) and nuclear export signals (NESs) within transcription factors (Hood and Silver, 1999). The phosphorylation or dephosphorylation of a transcription factor can directly regulate the accessibility of these NLSs and NESs to nuclear import and export proteins by masking or unmasking the signal sequences on transcription factors. Alternatively, indirect effects can be induced by modulating the binding of other regulatory proteins which mask or unmask the signal sequences on transcription factors.

MAPK signaling pathways are implicated in regulating the cellular localisation of a number of transcription factors. One well-characterised example is the Drosophila ETS-domain transcriptional repressor Yan (also called Aop). Yan is a key target of the Ras/ERK signalling pathway downstream of the Sevenless receptor tyrosine kinase (reviewed in Raabe, 2000). The nonphosphorylated form of Yan binds to composite ETS-AP1 sites in the promoters of genes required for the differentiation of precursor cells into R7 photoreceptor neurones in the Drosophila eye (reviewed in Raabe, 2000). The activation of the Sevenless signaling pathway leads to ERK phosphorylation of Yan, which results in its exclusion from the nucleus thereby relieving its inhibitory effect. Simultaneously, ERK phosphorylates the transcriptional activator Pointed-P2 which replaces Yan at the ETS-AP1 sites and enhances gene transcription

![Figure 3](#fig3)

Fig. 3. MAPK signalling regulates multiple aspects of transcription. MAPKs can phosphorylate (P) transcription factors (TF) and regulate their import and export from the nucleus. Once phosphorylated, transcription factors often change conformation leading to the regulation of their functions including DNA binding and interactions with co-activators or co-repressors. These co-activators and co-repressors, as well as chromatin remodelling components, can also be subject to regulation by MAPK cascades. In some cases, the phosphorylation of transcription factors modulates their stability. MAPK signalling can therefore regulate multiple events at the same gene promoter.
(Brunner et al., 1994; O'Neill et al., 1994). In a separate context, Yan is phosphorylated and inactivated by Drosophila JNK (DJNK) which simultaneously phosphorylates the positive regulator DJun to promote *decapentaplegic* (Dpp) expression during dorsal closure (Riesgo-Escovar and Hafen, 1997). Similar mechanisms appear to exist for regulating mammalian ETS-domain transcription factors. For example, the ERK pathway targets the repressor ERF leading to its exclusion from the nucleus (Le Gallic et al., 1999), and also positively regulates the transcriptional activity of a number of ETS-domain transcription factors (reviewed in Sharrocks, 2002). These examples demonstrate that the phosphorylation of distinct transcriptional regulators by the same MAPK pathway can both relieve inhibition (by nuclear exclusion) and activate transcription from the same promoter site. In contrast to this, different residues of the same transcription factor can be phosphorylated by different MAPKs with distinct functional consequences. The ETS-domain transcription factor Net/SAP2 is a repressor that can be converted to a transcriptional activator by phosphorylation of residues within the C-terminal domain by ERK (Price et al., 1995; Ducret et al., 2000). A separate group of residues are phosphorylated by JNK, leading to the exclusion of Net/SAP2 from the nucleus and therefore relieving repression (Ducret et al., 1999, 2000).

A second group of transcription factors whose activity is regulated by nucleocytoplasmic shuttling are the members of the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) family (reviewed in Rao et al., 1997). In this case, nuclear import of NFAT is induced by dephosphorylation mediated by the calcium-dependent protein phosphatase calcineurin (also called protein phosphatase 2B) which exposes one or more NLSs (reviewed in Rao et al., 1997). The action of calcineurin is opposed by a number of protein kinases that phosphorylate NFAT. The protein kinases involved depend on the signaling pathways activated or the particular NFAT isoform. The NFAT4 and NFATc1 isoforms can be phosphorylated by JNK leading to their exclusion from the nucleus (Chow et al., 1997, 2000). This may occur by phosphorylation leading to the exposure of an NES or, as proposed for NFATc1, it is possible that phosphorylation blocks the binding of calcineirin which is essential for efficient dephosphorylation of NFAT (Chow et al., 2000). Genetic evidence to support a role for JNK in negatively regulating NFATc1 activity has come from the analysis of *Jnk1--/* T cells which exhibit greatly increased NFATc1-dependent nuclear responses (Chow et al., 2000). The isoforms NFATp and NFATc4 are targeted by the p38 pathway which contributes to their exclusion from the nucleus (Gomez-del Arco, 2000; Yang et al., 2002). In the case of NFATc4, it is proposed that phosphorylation by p38 alone is insufficient for nuclear exclusion but serves to prime NFATc4 for phosphorylation by additional protein kinases which then leads to its nuclear exclusion (Yang et al., 2002).

The examples described above focus on the role of MAPK pathways in opposing nuclear localisation of transcription factors, but it is clear that MAPKs can also promote nuclear translocation of some transcription factors. For example, the activation of the JNK and p38 pathways promotes the nuclear translocation of SMAD3, a member of the SMAD family of transcription factors (Engel et al., 1999; Leivonen et al., 2002). The regulation of SMADs by MAPKs appears to be highly complex and is an area of some controversy. It has been reported that the phosphorylation of SMAD1, SMAD2 and SMAD3 by ERK blocks their translocation to the nucleus resulting in inhibition of SMAD-mediated transcription (Kretzschmar et al., 1997, 1999). Such a mechanism has been invoked to explain the potent inhibitory effect of oncogenic Ras on TGF-β responses that act through the SMADs (Kretzschmar et al., 1999). However, two separate studies have reported that the ERK pathway has a positive effect on SMAD transcriptional activation (de Caestecker et al., 1998; Funaba et al., 2002), while other studies have failed to detect any effects of ERK signaling on SMAD activity (Hu et al., 1999; Lehmann et al., 2000). It seems likely therefore that the role of the ERK pathway in SMAD regulation is dependent on the particular SMAD isoform and the cellular context. Another example of this type of regulation occurs with pancreatic duodenal homeobox-1 (PDX-1) which is induced to enter the nucleus upon stimulation with insulin and glucose. The involvement of the p38 pathway in this process is implied by the use of pharmacological inhibitors of p38 that block nuclear translocation of PDX-1 (Elrick and Docherty, 2001). In addition to transcription factors, corepressor complex components such as HDAC4 can accumulate in the nucleus in response to Ras/ERK pathway activation (Zhou et al., 2000).

The efficient phosphorylation of transcription factors by MAPKs requires that these proteins colocalise in cells. Therefore, in addition to mechanisms that control the localisation of transcription factors, there are also mechanisms to control the cellular distribution of MAPKs to ensure that the appropriate transcriptional responses to extracellular stimuli are elicited. In unstimulated cells, ERK is predominantly cytoplasmic, but upon activation, it accumulates in the nucleus (reviewed in Lewis et al., 1998). The type and duration of the stimulation can affect the extent of nuclear accumulation and hence transcriptional responses. Inactive ERK may be anchored in the cytoplasm by associating with its activator MEK, or with protein phosphatases or with regulatory/scaffold proteins (Fukuda et al., 1997; Brunet et al., 1999; Zuniga et al., 1999; Whitmarsh and Davis, 1998). Upon activation, ERK is phosphorylated and released from these anchors and may form dimers which promotes its nuclear translocation (Khokhlatchev et al., 1998). Not all activated ERK translocates to the nucleus but some is retained in the cytoplasm by association with the microtubule cytoskeleton (Reszka et al., 1995) or by interaction with regulatory proteins such as PEA-15 (Formstecher et al.,
2001). Similar types of mechanisms are likely to control the localisation of the other mammalian MAPKs.

### 4.2. Control of transcription factor protein levels

A second important mechanism for regulating transcription factor function is to control the amount of the transcription factor. This can be achieved by either modulating transcription factor expression levels or the stability of the proteins. MAPK pathways regulate the expression of many transcription factors, the best studied of which are the AP-1 family members c-Jun and c-Fos (reviewed in Whitmarsh and Davis, 1996). MAPKs can regulate the expression levels of genes encoding these transcription factors. For example, JNK, ERK5 and isoforms of p38 have been implicated in the regulation of the c-jun promoter depending on the stimulus (Han et al., 1997; Kato et al., 1997; Marinissen et al., 1999, 2001). The effects of p38 and ERK5 are in part mediated by the phosphorylation and activation of the transcription factor MEF2C (Han et al., 1997; Kato et al., 1997) which binds to the c-jun promoter. c-Jun also binds to its own promoter as a heterodimer with ATF-2, thereby forming a positive autoregulatory loop (Whitmarsh and Davis, 1996). c-Jun is targeted by the JNK pathway in response to stress and ATF-2 is a target of the JNK, p38 and ERK pathways depending on the stimulus (Derijard et al., 1994; Gupta et al., 1995; Raingeaud et al., 1995; Ouwens et al., 2002). These MAPKs phosphorylate the transcriptional activation domains (TADs) of c-Jun and ATF-2 leading to increased transcriptional activity (Derijard et al., 1994; Gupta et al., 1995; Raingeaud et al., 1995). Like the c-jun promoter, the c-fos promoter contains a number of elements that are targets for MAPK signaling (reviewed in Whitmarsh and Davis, 1996). For example, the serum response element (SRE) binds to a complex of serum response factor (SRF) and ETS-domain ternary complex factors (TCFs), including Elk-1 and SAP-1 (reviewed in Sharrocks, 2001). Elk-1 can be phosphorylated and activated by ERK, JNK and p38 while SAP-1 is phosphorylated by ERK and p38, leading to enhanced transcription of the c-fos gene (reviewed in Sharrocks, 2002). The regulation of immediate early genes such as c-jun and c-fos is therefore highly complex requiring the integration of multiple signaling pathways that target multiple promoter elements.

The phosphorylation of transcription factors can affect their stability by regulating the covalent attachment of ubiquitin to lysine residues. Ubiquitin is attached to target proteins by an enzyme complex (E1, E2 and E3) and the ubiquitinated proteins are degraded by the 26S proteasome (reviewed in Hersko and Ciechanover, 1998). The association of inactive JNK with many of its transcription factor targets including c-Jun, JunB, ATF-2 and p53 is reported to target them for ubiquitination and degradation (Fuchs et al., 1997, 1998; Musti et al., 1997). Activated JNK phosphorylates these transcription factors which protects them from degradation and therefore contributes to promoting transcriptional activation (Fuchs et al., 1997, 1998; Musti et al., 1997). The exact mechanism by which inactive JNK promotes ubiquitination is currently not clear. Conversely, rather than phosphorylation promoting the stability of transcription factors, it can promote their degradation. The nuclear hormone receptors progesterone receptor (PR) and retinoic acid receptor-γ2 (RARγ2) undergo ligand-dependent degradation mediated by the ERK and p38 pathways, respectively (Lange et al., 2000; Gianni et al., 2002). Interestingly, the transactivation of these nuclear receptors is coupled to their degradation, providing a mechanism for short-lived activation (Shen et al., 2001; Gianni et al., 2002). The linking of transactivation to degradation is not restricted to nuclear hormone receptors and may represent a fairly common mechanism for transcriptional regulation. For example, microphthalmia (Mi), a transcription factor that is required for melanocyte development, is phosphorylated by ERK and Rsk, leading to both its activation and rapid degradation (Wu et al., 2000).

### 4.3. Regulation of DNA binding

The binding of transcription factors to gene promoters can be regulated either positively or negatively by phosphorylation. This may occur by direct phosphorylation of the DNA-binding domain. The POU-domain transcription factor TCFβ1 is phosphorylated by JNK leading to enhanced DNA binding (Kasibhatla et al., 1999), while in response to growth factor stimulation the ribosomal transcription factor UBF is phosphorylated within its HMG box DNA-binding domain by ERK preventing interaction with DNA (Stefanovsky et al., 2001). Alternatively, DNA binding may be indirectly regulated by phosphorylation. For example, the phosphorylation of Elk-1 on Ser and Thr residues within its C-terminal TAD by multiple MAPKs results in stimulation of DNA binding by the N-terminal ETS domain, presumably via an allosteric mechanism (Yang et al., 1999b). Similarly, JNK phosphorylation of the N-terminal transactivation domain of c-Jun enhances DNA binding by promoting the dephosphorylation of sites close to the C-terminal DNA-binding domain that, when phosphorylated, inhibit DNA binding (Papavassiliou et al., 1995).

### 4.4. Regulation of transactivation/transrepression activity

Many transcription factors contain phosphorylation-dependent TADs, and in a few cases, phosphorylation-dependent transcriptional repression domains. The precise mechanisms by which phosphorylation of these domains regulates transcriptional activity is poorly understood. As mentioned above, DNA binding is one aspect that can be regulated, but it is likely that phosphorylation modulates other intrinsic transcription factor activities such as their

affinities for coactivators, corepressors or the general transcription machinery. This could occur by the phosphorylated residues directly blocking interactions or forming part of interacting surfaces, or indirectly by phosphorylation inducing a conformational change which unmasks or masks binding surfaces.

The best characterised example of the phosphorylation-mediated interaction of a transcription factor with a coactivator occurs between CREB and the highly related coactivators CREB-binding protein (CBP) and p300. CREB is phosphorylated on Ser-133 by a number of protein kinases leading to enhanced transcriptional activity (reviewed in Mayr and Montminy, 2001). These kinases include MSK1 and MSK2 which are downstream of the ERK and p38 pathways (Deak et al., 1998; Wiggin et al., 2002). Phosphorylated CREB recruits CBP or p300 which can act as a bridge to the RNA polymerase II transcriptional initiation complex and also acetylate promoter-bound histones, resulting in enhanced transcriptional activity (reviewed in Mayr and Montminy, 2001). In addition to simple p300/CBP recruitment, it has recently been demonstrated that phosphorylation-dependent association between a transcription factor and p300 can enhance the activity of this coactivator. In this case, Elk-1 associates with p300 in the absence of stimuli but additional interactions are induced upon phosphorylation of the Elk-1 TAD by ERK leading to enhanced histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity (Li et al., 2003). One advantage of this mechanism is that pre-assembly of a transcription factor-coactivator complex allows for very rapid transcriptional activation following signaling pathway activation. In addition to p300 activation, Elk-1 phosphorylation by ERKs regulates the recruitment of Sur-2, a component of the human mediator complex and hence promotes communication with the basal transcription machinery (Stevens et al., 2002). Thus MAPK-mediated Elk-1 phosphorylation triggers two important events: activation of a prebound coactivator and recruitment of a second coactivator complex.

In addition to regulating the HAT activity of coactivators, the intrinsic HAT activity of the transcription factor ATF-2 is regulated by MAPK phosphorylation. The HAT activity of ATF-2 towards histones H2B and H4 is enhanced in response to UV light due to the phosphorylation of the ATF-2 TAD by JNK and/or p38 (Kawasaki et al., 2000). The exact mechanism remains to be elucidated but is likely to involve a phosphorylation-induced conformational change of the protein.

In addition to promoting their transcriptional activity by the recruitment of coactivators, phosphorylation can lead to transcription factor activation through relieving their repressive activities. Alternatively, MAPK pathway activation can lead to enhanced repressive activities. For example, phosphorylation of the corepressor TGIF by ERK enhances the interaction between SMAD2 and TGIF (Lo et al., 2001). Activation of the MAP kinase pathway leads to the recruitment of an alternative mSin3A-HDAC

corepressor complex to Elk-1 after initially acting as an activating signal. This delayed recruitment permits activation followed by repression of target genes in response to a single signaling event (Yang et al., 2001). Furthermore, Elk-1 contains a second repression domain that is modified by conjugation to the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) (Yang et al., 2003). In this case, activation of the ERK pathway results in the removal of SUMO, thereby relieving repression, and allowing Elk-1 to activate transcription (Yang et al., 2003).

Another way of inhibiting transcriptional activation by MAPK-mediated phosphorylation is exemplified by the nuclear hormone receptor PPARγ that is phosphorylated by ERK and JNK MAPKs. This phosphorylation leads to a reduction in its transcriptional activity (Hu et al., 1996; Camp et al., 1999) probably by reducing ligand binding to PPARγ (Shao et al., 1998).

As discussed previously, the minimal consensus site for phosphorylation by MAPKs is Ser/Thr-Pro. Proteins phosphorylated at such sites are potential targets for the peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase Pin1 which can convert the peptide bond preceding the Pro between the trans and cis configurations (reviewed in Ryo et al., 2003). This isomerisation can lead to conformational changes in the proteins that can dramatically affect function. An increasing number of transcription factors appear to be targeted by Pin1. c-Jun phosphorylated at Ser-63 and Ser-73 by JNK binds to Pin1 and this results in enhanced c-Jun transcriptional activity (Wulf et al., 2001), while N-terminal phosphorylation of p53 by a number of protein kinases, including JNK and p38, results in Pin1 recruitment and the stabilisation of p53 by reducing its affinity for the ubiquitin ligase MDM2 (Zacchi et al., 2002; Zheng et al., 2002). Conversely, during EGF signalling in the Drosophila egg, the transcriptional repressor Cf2 is phosphorylated by ERK and recruits Pin1, leading to Cf2 ubiquitination and proteolytic degradation, presumably via a conformation-induced exposure of signature motifs for degradation (Hsu et al., 2001). It is clear that Pin1 activity modulates a number of aspects of transcription factor function, presumably by catalysing a phosphorylation-dependent conformational switch.

In addition to targeting specific transcription factors that bind to characteristic elements in promoters, MAPKs can also target components of the general transcription initiation machinery. For example TFII-I associates with ERK and is phosphorylated leading to enhanced transcription from the c-fos promoter (Kim and Cochran, 2000). It is currently not clear if ERK phosphorylation impacts on other aspects of TFII-I function. The TATA-binding protein (TBP) component of the TFIID transcription factor complex can be phosphorylated by ERK and p38, potentially enhancing its binding to the TATA box and to transcription factors (Biggs et al., 1998; Carter et al., 1999), while the RNA polymerase I transcription factor TIF-IA is phosphorylated by ERK and Rsk kinases which promotes pre-rRNA synthesis and cell growth (Zhao et al., 2003).

4.5. MAPKs as components of transcription factor complexes

Recent evidence suggests that in addition to their role in phosphorylating transcription factors, MAPKs may also be integral components of transcriptional activation complexes on gene promoters. Work on the osmotic stress response pathway in the yeast *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* has indicated such a role for the Hog1 MAPK. Activated Hog1 can be recruited to distinct promoters by direct interactions with the DNA-bound transcription factors Hot1 or Sko1 (Alepuz et al., 2001; Proft and Struhl, 2002). Hog1 phosphorylates Hot1 although, somewhat surprisingly, this is not a requirement for osmotic-stress induced gene transcription. The model proposed is that Hot1 recruits Hog1 to phosphorylate either additional transcription factors, chromatin remodeling complexes or nucleosomal components (Alepuz et al., 2001). In the absence of signal, Sko1 binds to promoter elements as part of a repressor complex with Cyc8 and Tup1. Exposure of the yeast to hyperosmotic stress induces the recruitment of Hog1 to Sko1 and leads to the phosphorylation of Sko1 by Hog1 (Proft and Struhl, 2002). This in turn promotes the recruitment of SAGA and SWI/SNF chromatin-modifying factors and results in transcriptional activation. The recruitment of activated Hog1 therefore converts the Sko1-Cyc8-Tup1 transcriptional repressor into a transcriptional activator (Proft and Struhl, 2002). It is likely that mammalian MAPKs are recruited to promoter complexes to perform similar functions. Indeed, there is evidence for a direct role of ERK5 in transcriptional activation. ERK5 contains a potent transcriptional activation domain within its extended C-terminus (Kasler et al., 2000). Activated ERK5 binds to the transcription factor MEF2D and is required for maximal transcriptional activation of MEF2D (Kasler et al., 2000). This effect of ERK5 appeared to be independent of ERK5 phosphorylation of MEF2D (Kasler et al., 2000) which had previously been reported (Kato et al., 2000).

scription factor, Lin-1. Thus, this provides a potential link between a coactivator protein, Sur-2, and MAPK signaling pathways.

The coactivators CBP and p300 play a key role in many aspects of gene regulation, being recruited to the DNA via transcription factors through both signal-dependent and independent mechanisms. Several studies now link these coactivators in directly coordinating responses to MAPK pathways. Interestingly, CBP itself is associated with and phosphorylated by ERK following NGF treatment (Liu et al., 1999), and this enhances its transcriptional activating capacity (Liu et al., 1998). Similarly, in cardiac cells, the activity of CBP and p300 is stimulated by phenylephrine treatment via the ERK MAPK pathway. In this case, the ERK pathway activates these coactivators by differentially targeting the N-terminus of p300 and the C-terminus of CBP (Gusterson et al., 2002).

Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) activation in tumours is caused by several factors including ERK MAPK signaling. Again, p300 is involved, but HIF-1 is not a direct target and its phosphorylation is not required for HIF-p300 interaction. These data suggest that MAPK signaling facilitates HIF activation through modulating p300/CBP activity (Sang et al., 2003).

Further complexity in MAPK signaling to CBP arises from the observation that persistent ERK activation negatively regulates CREB activity via recruitment of RSK to CBP (Wang et al., 2003b). However, it is unclear whether phosphorylation of CBP is required in this process. In addition to ERK signaling, p300-mediated transcription is also influenced by the upstream kinase in the JNK cascade, MEKK1 (See et al., 2001). However, direct phosphorylation of p300 by JNK is not required for this process.

Other coactivators, in addition to p300/CBP, have been shown to be targeted directly by MAPKs. For example, recent studies demonstrated that members of p160 family of steroid receptor coactivators, SRC-1 and GRIP-1, are direct MAPK targets. In both SRC-1 and GRIP-1, ERK pathway activation leads to enhanced coactivation function (Rowan et al., 2000; Lopez et al., 2001). Similarly, phosphorylation of PPAR-binding protein (PBP), a pivotal component of the TRAP/DRIP/ARC coactivator complex, by ERK exerts a positive effect on PBP coactivator function (Misra et al., 2002). PPARγ coactivator-1 (PGC-1) is a substrate for p38 upon cytokine treatment (Puigserver et al., 2001; Barger et al., 2001). A repressor or repressor complex is normally bound to PGC-1 and competes with the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) for recruitment of PGC-1. The activation of the p38 pathway precludes repressor binding to PGC-1 and ultimately leads to transcriptional activation by PGC-1 binding to GR (Knutti et al., 2001). However, it is not clear whether p38 directly phosphorylates PGC-1 or the yet unidentified repressor. Together, these examples demonstrate mechanisms that exist whereby MAPK pathways may provide two inputs at a promoter to both transcription factors and their coactivators (discussed further below).

5. MAPK signaling to transcriptional coregulatory proteins

MAPK signaling to promoters is not limited to transmitting signals to transcription factors and the basal machinery. Increasing evidence suggests that coregulatory factors are also directly targeted by MAPK signaling pathways. By targeting different parts of the same transcription regulatory complex, further levels of regulation can potentially be achieved. A link between MAPK cascades and coactivators is suggested from the discovery that mutations in *sur2*, a subunit of the metazoan mediator complex, suppress an activated-*ras* multivulva phenotype and produce multiple pleiotropic developmental defects in *Caenorhabditis elegans* (Singh and Han, 1995). Sur2 also interacts genetically with the MAPK-regulated ETS-domain tran-

In addition to being MAPK targets, coregulatory proteins can also feedback and modify MAPK pathways. For example, GPS2, an integral subunit of the N-CoR-HDAC3 corepressor complex, can inhibit JNK MAPK activation and thereby attenuate signaling (Zhang et al., 2002).

## 6. The roles of signaling pathways at the nucleosomal level

It is becoming increasingly clear that nucleosomal structure plays a key role in regulating gene transcription. In particular, histones are key players and a diverse array of post-translational modifications within the tail domains of histones have been shown to regulate chromatin structure and hence regulate gene transcription (reviewed in Strahl and Allis, 2000). One such modification is histone phosphorylation. In addition, it has been demonstrated that acetylation of nucleosomes in the c-fos promoter region increases during gene induction in response to the JNK MAPK signaling pathway (Alberts et al., 1998). Thus histone acetylation can also be enhanced in response to MAPK pathways, permitting further inputs to the promoter in addition to direct targeting of transcription factors and coactivators (Fig. 4).

Phosphorylation of histone H3 in immediate-early gene promoters on serine 10 is mediated via the ERK or p38 MAPK cascades in response to a variety of mitogenic and stress stimuli (Clayton et al., 2000; Zhong et al., 2000; Chadee et al., 2002). Two kinases located downstream from the ERK and/or p38 kinases, MSK1/2 and RSK2, have been identified that are responsible for histone phosphorylation (Fig. 4; Sassone-Corsi et al., 1999; Thomson et al., 1999). A direct correlation between histone phosphorylation and the induction of immediate-early genes, such as c-fos, c-jun and c-myc (reviewed in Thomson et al., 1999), suggests a direct link between histone phosphorylation and gene activation.

What is the impact of histone phosphorylation on the regulation of gene expression? A “combinatorial” and a “dynamic” model have recently been suggested. The combinatorial model is supported by the observation that rapid and sequential phosphorylation and acetylation of histone H3 takes place on the c-fos promoter upon activation of MAPK signaling pathways. Cross talk between these two modifications is suggested, which is supported by the observation that phospho-histone H3 creates a better substrate for subsequent acetylation by GCN5 (Cheung et al., 2000). This leads to the preferential accumulation of the dimodified (phospho-acetylated) histone H3 at the c-fos promoter following ERK pathway activation. In addition to ERK signaling, arsenite-mediated p38 pathway activation induces the accumulation of phospho-acetylated histone H3 at the MKP-1 promoter (Li et al., 2001).

An alternative mechanism (dynamic model) has also been suggested from the observation that, histone H3 phosphorylation by MAPK pathways and acetylation are independent and dynamically regulated processes in controlling c-fos and c-jun transcription (Thomson et al., 2001; reviewed in Hazzalin and Mahadevan, 2002). Future studies will resolve which of these models is correct, or indeed if elements of both models are in action on immediate-early gene promoters.

It is unclear what role the phosphorylation of histones plays but phosphorylated histone tails may act to provide motifs for binding to specific domains located in additional regulatory proteins in an analogous manner to bromodomain binding to acetyl-lysine motifs (Dyson et al., 2001).

In addition to histone modifications, gross nucleosomal remodelling can be regulated by MAPK pathways. For example, phosphorylation of Sko-1 by the yeast p38-like MAPK, Hog, promotes recruitment of the SWI/SNF and SAGA chromatin-modifying complexes (see above; Proft and Struhl, 2002). Thus, chromatin remodelling activities and MAPK signaling cascades may act together in gene regulation.

## 7. Complexities in signaling outcomes in the nucleus

MAP kinase cascades are often portrayed as linear pathways that culminate in the phosphorylation of a single transcription factor and hence activation of the corresponding target gene(s). However, while this is part of the story, it is clear that further complexities exist.

Firstly, MAP kinase pathways interact with different signaling events to modulate the transcriptional output of a target protein. The first demonstration of such interactions was the demonstration that two different MAP kinase cascades, ERK and JNK, could converge on a single transcription factor Elk-1 (Whitmarsh et al., 1995). In this case, Elk-1 acts to independently transduce either stress (via JNK) or mitogenic (via ERK) signals into a nuclear response. Similarly, ERK and JNK can phosphorylate Fos in Drosophila but they do so in a distinct pattern. In this case, these phosphorylation events were shown to give rise to a pathway-specific biological response (Ciapponi et al.,

2001). However, direct interplay between different MAP kinase pathways on the same transcription factor, ATF2, has recently been demonstrated (Ouwens et al., 2002). Here, growth factors lead to dual phosphorylation of ATF2 through a two-step mechanism involving firstly the ERK pathway, followed by a second phosphorylation event mediated by p38. Thus, different MAP kinase pathways can either target the same residues on a transcription factor in a mutually exclusive manner, target different residues to give distinct outcomes, or act synergistically to bring about dual phosphorylation and a concerted response.

The nuclear hormone receptors were traditionally viewed as responding to small ligands. However, increasing evidence now points to additional dynamic interactions with the MAPK signaling pathways (Fig. 5). Since the original observation that the estrogen receptor (ER) is phosphorylated by ERK in the AF-1 transcriptional activation domain and hence activated in a ligand-independent manner (Kato et al., 1995), numerous additional studies have identified nuclear hormone receptors as MAPK targets (see Table 1). More recently, the nuclear hormone receptors themselves have been shown to be important activators of the MAP kinase pathways and hence contribute to the nongenomic effects of steroid hormones. Interactions between the pro-

Fig. 5. Complexities in interaction between the MAPK signaling cascades and ligand-activated nuclear hormone receptors (NRs). NRs can act as monomers or as homo- or heterodimers (depicted as subunits A and B in the figure). Different activation and signaling events are depicted based on these generic subunits but many of these responses have only been shown for a subset of NRs (see text for details). MAPKs can activate NRs by phosphorylating their transcriptional activation domains. In addition, the downstream kinase Rsk2 has been shown to allosterically activate NRs. Similarly, one NR can allosterically activate a second NR by promoting ERK recruitment. Steroid hormones can directly activate NRs or can elicit “nongenomic” activation of MAPK pathways. Ligand-dependent NR activation can promote Src binding and MAPK activation.

gestrone receptor (PR) and ER were shown to promote activation of the ERK pathway in a ligand-dependent manner through activating Src (Migliaccio et al., 1998). In the case of PR, this is due to the hormone-dependent recruitment of Src family members through their SH3 domains to a motif located in the N-terminus of the receptor (Boonyaratanakornkit et al., 2001). ER can also bind directly to Src family members, but in this case, interactions are through the SH2 motif and require the presence of an additional ER-partner protein, MNAR, which provides extra contacts to the SH3 domain of Src (Wong et al., 2002). This situation is further complicated by the observation that estrogen can also trigger p38 pathway activation and p38-dependent phosphorylation of the ER AF-1 domain (Lee and Bai, 2002).

Another example of cooperativity between steroid hormones and the MAPK pathways is in retinoic acid (RA) induction of RARγ2 (Gianni et al., 2002). Here RA promotes both p38-mediated AF-1 phosphorylation and ligand-dependent AF-2 activation. Together, these activate RARγ2, but also trigger its degradation through recruitment of SUG-1 and the associated proteosome, thereby playing a pivotal role in its regulation. In contrast, the RARα receptor provides an example of antagonism in signaling where it causes transrepression of AP-1 activity, at least in part, by excluding ERK from promoters (Benkoussa et al., 2002).

Several nuclear hormone receptors have no known ligand and hence are known as orphan receptors. Nevertheless, cross talk between these receptors and the MAPK cascades has been observed. The orphan receptor COUP-TFI binds to ERα and promotes ERK recruitment and phosphorylation of the AF-1 domain in ERα, providing yet another point of regulation of ERα (Metivier et al., 2002). For ERα, this complexity is further underlined by the observation that Rsk2, a kinase immediately downstream from ERK, binds to ERα and allosterically activates it (Clark et al., 2001).

A classic example of antagonistic signaling is the differing effects of the TGF-β and EGF/ERK pathways on the activity of SMAD proteins. While TGF-β promotes their nuclear translocation, ERK-mediated phosphorylation in response to proliferative signals causes nuclear exclusion of the SMADs (Kretzschmar et al., 1997, 1999). However, recent results suggest that MAP kinase signaling can also promote SMAD nuclear localization and activity (see discussion above). Thus the interactions between these pathways are likely to be complex and may depend on the particular SMAD protein involved and the cellular context.

A further example of antagonistic signaling is the interaction of the SUMO and ERK pathways in regulating the transcriptional output from Elk-1 (Yang et al., 2003). SUMO modification of Elk-1 reduces its transcriptional activity. This SUMO modification is removed upon activation of the ERK pathway, which in turn leads to de-

repression of the Elk-1 transcriptional activation domain and permits recruitment and/or activation of coactivator proteins.

By targeting different parts of the same transcriptional regulatory complex, further levels of regulation can be achieved. For example, the nuclear hormone receptor coactivator protein PGC-1 is phosphorylated and activated by p38 (Puigserver et al., 2001), thereby providing two potential activating signaling inputs at the level of the transcription factor and coactivator. Antagonistic activities can also be envisaged, resulting in a reduced or an ablated response to a MAPK pathway. Such scenarios are important to consider when studying complex eukaryotic promoters rather than individual transcription factors. A clear example of this can be seen in studies of Ras signaling in *Drosophila* (Halfon et al., 2000). While the transcription factors Yan and Pointed are well-known direct targets of this pathway, Ras-responsive promoters such as the MHE enhancer in the *eve* gene contain multiple different transcription factor binding sites that respond to other signaling events including the Dpp and Wg pathways. In addition, Wg signaling also regulates the expression of key proximal components of the Ras pathway. Together, these signaling events provide a two-tiered competency event for Ras signaling that cannot function to activate this enhancer in the absence of these additional signaling inputs, thereby demonstrating the importance of signal integration *in vivo*.

Further signaling complexities can be divulged from the observation that the duration and magnitude of the signal can affect substrate phosphorylation and the transcriptional output from the same pathway. It has long been recognized that transient and sustained signaling from the Ras/ERK pathway can lead to the different biological outcomes of proliferation and differentiation, respectively (reviewed in Marshall, 1995). Recently, one route to the differential interpretation of transient and prolonged signals at the molecular level has been discovered in the transcription factor c-Fos (Murphy et al., 2002). Transient ERK signaling leads to the induction of *c-fos* transcription but not phosphorylation of the c-Fos protein itself, so c-Fos is rapidly degraded. However, upon prolonged signaling, c-Fos itself is phosphorylated, leading to its stabilization and the activation of downstream events. A MAPK docking domain in c-Fos plays a pivotal role in this secondary response to prolonged MAP kinase signaling.

Lastly, in addition to the MAP kinases themselves, upstream components of the pathways have been shown to play direct roles in regulating transcription factor function. The myogenic transcription factor MyoD is not phosphorylated by any of the MAP kinases; nonetheless, its transcriptional activity is repressed by activation of the ERK pathway (Perry et al., 2001). This repression is caused by the binding of active MEK to MyoD and subsequent inhibition of its transcriptional activation domain. Biologically, this interaction leads to inhibition of myogenesis but it is not clear how this works at the molecular level.

8. The role of MAPK signaling in controlling gene expression in vivo

Over the past few years, a great many studies have identified novel transcriptional targets of the MAPK pathways (see Table 1). It will be important to confirm that MAPK substrates identified *in vitro* are bone fide substrates *in vivo* and to develop more efficient methods for identifying protein kinase substrates. However, the major challenge for the future will be to understand the physiological consequences of the phosphorylation of transcription factors by MAPKs and how signals from multiple pathways are integrated by promoter-bound transcription factor complexes and chromatin-modifying factors to determine the pattern of gene expression in cells. A number of approaches are being used to address these issues including gene disruption in mice or gene-knockdown by small interfering RNAs (RNAi), pharmaceutical intervention, proteomics and gene expression microarray-based technologies and bioinformatics.

In the past, the identification of MAPK targets has been slow and has relied on techniques such as protein–protein interaction screens, biochemical purification of potential substrates, and educated guesswork based on the characterized phosphorylation sites on a protein and the stimuli that lead to their phosphorylation. Interaction screens are clearly not directed at picking out protein kinase substrates but have proved useful for MAPKs which often ‘dock’ with their substrates at sites distinct from the phosphorylation motif (see above; Sharrocks et al., 2000). However, such screens are unlikely to pick up weaker transient interactions and are subject to high rates of false positives. The efficiency of predicting MAPK and other protein kinase substrates has been greatly improved by computer algorithms based on the use of degenerate peptides to determine optimal phosphorylation motifs (e.g. Yaffe et al., 2001). However, while a useful tool, candidate substrates will still need to be investigated experimentally. Proteomics techniques are likely to play an increasingly central role in the identification of MAPK substrates. For example, novel targets of the ERK pathway have been identified by 2D gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry (Lewis et al., 2000). Looking further ahead, the development of protein chips featuring the entire mammalian proteomes (reviewed in Zhu and Snyder, 2003) will potentially allow high throughput identification of MAPK substrates. Once transcription factor targets of MAPKs have been identified, their phosphorylation status in cells can be monitored by generating antibodies that specifically recognize the phosphorylation sites (Blaydes et al., 2000). The use of these phosphorylation-specific antibodies has allowed the temporal and spatial aspects of the phosphorylation of transcription factors by distinct signals to be uncovered.

Mice deficient in components of MAP kinase pathways or featuring mutations of phosphorylatable residues on transcription factors are proving to be useful tools for the

in vivo confirmation of MAPK targets and for understanding the roles of these phosphorylation events in gene expression and cell function. For example, gene targeting of the neuro- ally expressed Jnk gene, Jnk3, results in reduced seizure activity in response to excitotoxic stress and reduced apoptosis of hippocampal neurones (Yang et al., 1997). The ablation of Jnk3 gene expression also corresponded with reduced phosphorylation of the transactivation domain of the substrate c-Jun and reduced AP-1 transcriptional activity (Yang et al., 1997). Confirmation that JNK phosphorylation of c-Jun was a causal event for hippocampal neurone apoptosis and seizure activity was provided by the replacement of the endogenous c-Jun with a mutant c-Jun featuring the substitution of the JNK phosphorylation sites (Ser-63 and Ser-73) with nonphosphorylatable Ala residues (Behrens et al., 1999). This mutant mouse displayed a similar phenotype to the JNK3-deficient mice indicating that JNK phosphorylation of Ser-63 and Ser-73 of c-Jun was required for excitotoxic stress-induced neuronal apoptosis (Yang et al., 1997; Behrens et al., 1999). This approach of mutating characterised phosphorylation sites on transcription factors in vivo allows the dissection of the physiological and pathological roles of distinct signaling events that target transcription factors. Recently, RNAi techniques have become a powerful approach for reducing the expression of genes in vivo (reviewed in McManus and Sharp, 2002). Advantages over conventional gene targeting strategies are that it is less time consuming and it may be useful for reducing the expression of a gene in cells if deletion of the gene in mice results in early lethality, thereby preventing the isolation of primary cells. One disadvantage is that gene expression is usually not completely blocked. However, it is likely that in the future RNAi approaches will be extensively used to address the role of MAPK signaling pathways in gene expression.

The central role of MAPK pathways in many cellular processes has made components of these pathways attractive candidates for targeting by pharmacological inhibitors (reviewed in English and Cobb, 2002). Currently, several inhibitors are being used in cell and animal studies in the laboratory and some have progressed to clinical trials. Some of the best characterised are inhibitors of the p38 isoforms p38α and p38β. These drugs block the expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1 and tumour necrosis factor-α and have been successfully used in animal models of arthritis and other inflammatory diseases (reviewed in English and Cobb, 2002). Inhibitors of the ERK and JNK pathways are also widely used in the laboratory and are proving useful in determining the role of these pathways in gene expression. A caveat to the interpretation of such studies is that in some cases the specificity of the inhibitors is not fully established (reviewed in English and Cobb, 2002).

The approaches described above for determining the role of MAPK phosphorylation of transcription factors in vivo can be combined with the use of gene expression arrays to determine how the transcriptional programme of a cell is controlled by MAPK signaling pathways. For example, the gene expression profiles of cells expressing constitutively activated mutants of components of MAPK pathways or which are deficient for components of MAPK pathways can be monitored by the gene expression arrays. The MAPKKKK Raf links the small GTPase Ras to the ERK pathway. Recently, the transcriptional programme induced by Raf in epithelial cells was determined (Schulze et al., 2001). As might be expected, many of the genes induced by Raf encode proteins involved in cell proliferation and angiogenesis (Schulze et al., 2001). The gene expression programmes downstream of the JNK pathway have also been investigated and it has been demonstrated that distinct JNK isoforms promote distinct gene expression profiles (Han et al., 2002; Chen et al., 2002b). Careful interpretation of gene array results is required as the number of false positives or false negatives can be high. Nevertheless, microarray studies can potentially provide us with a more complete understanding of how the MAPK pathways affect gene expression. This can be a particularly powerful approach if linked to chromatin IP analysis, whereby transcriptional as well as signaling networks can be generated (e.g. Lee et al., 2002b).

### 9. Conclusions and perspectives

In the decade since the initial identification of Elk-1 as the first transcription factor target of the MAP kinase pathways (Gille et al., 1992; Marais et al., 1993; Janknecht et al., 1993) multiple different transcription factors have been identified as MAPK targets (Table 1). Since then, our understanding of how MAP kinase signaling to the nucleus is achieved at the molecular level has advanced significantly. Numerous transcription factor substrates have been identified and, more recently, several coactivator and corepressor proteins have been identified as additional targets. Indeed, we now know that these cascades also directly affect chromatin structure and hence gene regulation. As this complexity increases, we are beginning to understand how differential outputs from MAP kinase cascades are achieved at the transcriptional level. We are also now developing a deeper understanding of how specificity is maintained in MAPK signaling through docking interactions.

Future research promises to further our understanding of how MAP kinase signaling provides an integrated nuclear response. For example, MAP kinases have recently been shown to also regulate mRNA splicing. Here ERK-mediated phosphorylation of the RNA-binding protein, Sam68, leads to alternative splicing of the gene, as observed with CD44 (Matter et al., 2002). Thus MAPK pathways can regulate both transcription and the step that immediately follows. Further links with splicing are likely to follow.

Clearly, genomic and proteomic approaches will have an impact in our understanding of MAP kinase signaling, as will biomathematical approaches to pathway modelling that

will attempt to integrate the growing amount of information. For example, proteomic approaches could lead to the identification of more substrates for MAP kinases in particular cell types under defined conditions. The availability of large amounts of genome sequencing information could also facilitate the identification of new MAP kinase substrates by comparative genomics approaches between related species, using searches based on our knowledge of docking domains and phosphoacceptor motifs. However, more traditional approaches are also likely to yield further insights into MAPK signaling to the nucleus. Structural approaches will further our understanding of how MAPKs recognise their substrates. It is likely that more novel types of MAPK docking motifs will be identified. These structural studies will be particularly important for interactions between MAPKs and novel types of docking domains as these may lead to the development of specific inhibitors that are of therapeutic value.

Finally, it is likely that other major advances in our understanding of the consequences of MAP kinase signaling in the nucleus will be derived from studying complex promoters in developmental contexts. As genes are typically regulated by multiple transcription factors, each with its associated set of coactivators/corepressors, which respond to different signaling cascades, the output from a promoter will be determined by the net influence of all these factors. Studies along these lines have already begun to be initiated (e.g. Halfon et al., 2000). After individually dissecting the role of MAP kinase signaling to individual proteins, the challenge for the future will be understanding how these signals are integrated through transcription factor complexes to give a gene-specific transcriptional response.
