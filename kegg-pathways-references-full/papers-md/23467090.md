Recognition of sweet, bitter and umami tastes requires the non-vesicular release from taste bud cells of ATP, which acts as a neurotransmitter to activate afferent neural gustatory pathways${}^{1}$. However, how ATP is released to fulfil this function is not fully understood. Here we show that calcium homeostasis modulator 1 (CALHM1), a voltage-gated ion channel${}^{2,3}$, is indispensable for taste-stimuli-evoked ATP release from sweet-, bitter- and umami-sensing taste bud cells. *Calhm1* knockout mice have severely impaired perceptions of sweet, bitter and umami compounds, whereas their recognition of sour and salty tastes remains mostly normal. *Calhm1* deficiency affects taste perception without interfering with taste cell development or integrity. CALHM1 is expressed specifically in sweet/bitter/umami-sensing type II taste bud cells. Its heterologous expression induces a novel ATP permeability that releases ATP from cells in response to manipulations that activate the CALHM1 ion channel. Knockout of *Calhm1* strongly reduces voltage-gated currents in type II cells and taste-evoked ATP release from taste buds without affecting the excitability of taste cells by taste stimuli. Thus, CALHM1 is a voltage-gated ATP-release channel required for sweet, bitter and umami taste perception.

Tastes are sensed by dedicated receptor cells in taste buds, which are composed of three anatomically distinct types of cells: types I, II and III. Only type III cells, which sense sour tastes, have neuron-like features, including expression of neurotransmitter biosynthesis enzymes and synaptic vesicles at classical synapses with sensory nerve fibres${}^{1}$. Type II cells, which sense sweet, bitter and umami tastes, share a common signal-transduction pathway. However, they lack classical synaptic structures, yet transmit taste information to gustatory neurons by releasing ATP as a neurotransmitter${}^{4,5}$. Our work, described below, implicates CALHM1 as a critical component responsible for this ATP release.

*Calhm1* (ref. 6) encodes the pore-forming subunit of a voltage-gated, non-selective, plasma membrane ion channel involved in neuronal excitability${}^{2}$ and, potentially, the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease${}^{6–8}$. *Calhm1* expression was identified in primate taste buds${}^{9}$, suggesting that CALHM1 may have physiological functions outside the brain. We confirmed that *Calhm1* was expressed in mouse taste buds but not in surrounding epithelium (Fig. 1a, b, e–g). To examine CALHM1 function, we generated a constitutive *Calhm1*${}^{-/-}$ mouse and verified loss of *Calhm1* expression in taste buds (Fig. 1a, c). *Calhm1*${}^{-/-}$ mice were viable and fertile, with no overt morphological abnormalities in their taste buds nor any altered expression of taste-related marker genes (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 1). Loss of *Calhm1* signal in taste buds of *Skn-1a* (also known as *Pou2f3*) knockout mice, from which type II cells are developmentally absent${}^{10}$ (Fig. 1d and Supplementary Fig. 2), and the co-expression of *Calhm1* and *Trpm5* (Fig. 1h), demonstrated that *Calhm1* expression is confined to type II cells. Expression profiling by reverse-transcription PCR of pools of isolated type II and type III cells and individual taste cells also supported the confined expression of *Calhm1* to type II cells (Supplementary Fig. 3). *Calhm1* expression was observed not only in *Tas1r3*-expressing sweet and umami taste cells, but also in other type II cells, indicating that *Calhm1* is expressed in sweet, bitter and umami taste cells (Fig. 1i).

We used two behavioural tests and nerve recordings to evaluate the effect of the loss of CALHM1 expression on taste perception. Two-bottle preference tests revealed that *Calhm1*<sup>−/−</sup> mice had a nearly complete loss both of preference for sweet and umami compounds and of avoidance of bitter compounds (Fig. 2a, Supplementary Fig. 4a, c, d and Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). In contrast, there were little or no differences between wild-type and *Calhm1*<sup>−/−</sup> mice in their responses to salty and sour compounds (Fig. 2a, Supplementary Fig. 4a and Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). Brief-access taste tests reproduced these phenotypes (Fig. 2b, Supplementary Fig. 4b and Supplementary Table 3), demonstrating that the taste phenotype in *Calhm1*<sup>−/−</sup> mice is a sensory defect. Recordings of the whole chorda tympani nerve revealed strongly reduced responses to sweet, bitter and umami compounds in *Calhm1*<sup>−/−</sup> mice, whereas responses to NaCl and the acid compounds were not different from wild type (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Fig. 5), indicating that the sensory defect in *Calhm1*<sup>−/−</sup> mice was due to the knockout of CALHM1 function in the peripheral taste cell system. Together, these results indicate that CALHM1 has a crucial role in taste-sensing type II cells<sup>1,11</sup> (see Supplementary Information for further discussion).

Type II cells signal to the nervous system by non-vesicular ATP release to nearby afferent gustatory nerves<sup>5,12–14</sup>. Although connexin hemichannels and pannexin 1 have been proposed, the molecular identity of the ATP-release mechanism remains uncertain<sup>1,12,13,15</sup>. The CALHM1 pore diameter is ~14 Å (ref. 3), similar to that estimated for connexins. We therefore examined the possibility that CALHM1

mediates ATP release. The CALHM1 ion channel can be activated by membrane depolarization or reduction of extracellular Ca²⁺ concentration² ([Ca²⁺]ₒ). We first exploited the latter mechanism to activate CALHM1 in heterologous expression systems to determine whether CALHM1 can form an ATP-release channel. Decreasing [Ca²⁺]ₒ from 1.9 mM to essentially zero (17 nM) activated ATP release from human CALHM1 (hCALHM1)-expressing HeLa cells, whereas little ATP efflux was induced in mock-transfected cells (Fig. 3a, b). Similar low-[Ca²⁺]ₒ-induced ATP release was observed in hCALHM1-expressing COS-1 cells and Xenopus oocytes (Supplementary Fig. 6). Neither CALHM1 expression nor low-[Ca²⁺]ₒ exposure caused cell damage (Supplementary Fig. 7). Involvement of other possible mechanisms¹⁶ was ruled out because ATP release was unaffected by brefeldin A (vesicular release), DCPIB (volume-sensitive Cl⁻ channels), A438079 (P2X7 receptors), heptanol (connexin hemichannels) or carbenoxolone (pannexins and connexins at 30 μM) (Fig. 3d). In contrast, ruthenium red (RuR), which inhibits CALHM1 ion currents², abolished low-[Ca²⁺]ₒ-evoked ATP release from hCALHM1-expressing cells (Fig. 3c, d). Thus, CALHM1 expression induces a novel ATP permeability.

CALHM1 ion channel gating is regulated by [Ca²⁺]ₒ with an apparent half-maximum inhibitory [Ca²⁺] of IC₅₀ ≈ 220 μM and a Hill coefficient of 2.1 (ref. 2). Extracellular Ca²⁺ inhibited ATP release with IC₅₀ = 495 μM and a Hill coefficient of 1.9 (Fig. 3e, f). CALHM1 ion currents are also activated by membrane depolarization². At normal levels of [Ca²⁺]ₒ, hCALHM1-expressing, but not mock-transfected, cells released ATP in response to high-[K⁺]ₒ-induced depolarization (Fig. 3g, h). Depolarization-induced ATP release was inhibited by RuR

but not by heptanol or probenecid (Fig. 3i, j), which are respectively connexin and pannexin 1 blockers¹⁷. Expression of mouse CALHM1 conferred ATP release with similar properties (Supplementary Fig. 8). Regulation of ATP release in hCALHM1-expressing cells is therefore similar to that of CALHM1 channel gating, indicating that the CALHM1 channel is a conduit for ATP release.

The three types of taste bud cell can be classified on the basis of whole-cell electrophysiological fingerprints¹³,¹⁸. We verified these fingerprints by recording whole-cell currents in single isolated taste bud cells from TRPM5-green fluorescent protein (GFP) mice with GFP expressed specifically in type II cells (Supplementary Fig. 9). With tetraethylammonium in the extracellular solution and Cs⁺ as the major cation in the pipette solution² (to block K⁺ currents), the electrophysiological subtypes were identified by the combination of voltage-gated Na⁺ currents (Iₙₐ) and non-selective, slowly activating outward currents (I_slow) with inward tail currents at −70 mV (I_tail) (Fig. 4a–c and Supplementary Fig. 9). To identify CALHM1 ion currents, we recorded whole-cell currents in isolated taste bud cells from wild-type and Calhm1⁻/⁻ mice (Fig. 4a–c). Loss of CALHM1 substantially reduced the amplitudes of I_slow and I_tail without affecting the amplitude of Iₙₐ in type II cells (Fig. 4d–f), whereas no differences were observed in type I and type III cells (Fig. 4b, c, g). The slowly activating outward current in type II cells was inhibited by the non-specific CALHM1 blocker Gd³⁺ but not by probenecid or heptanol, ruling out contributions of pannexin 1 or connexins (Fig. 4h). These data demonstrate that CALHM1 channel conductance is present in type II cells and contributes the major component of the slowly activating outward current. Notably, the amount of depolarization-induced

ATP release from type II cells is correlated with the magnitude of $I_{\text{slow}}$ (ref. 13).

Type II cells detect sweet, bitter and umami compounds via G-protein-coupled taste receptors ${ }^{4}$ that stimulate a common signal-transduction cascade involving activation of PLCB2, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-mediated $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ release and $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-dependent activation of TRPM5 channels ${ }^{11}$ that depolarizes the plasma membrane to generate action potentials and subsequent non-vesicular release of ATP. Importantly, no differences in basal $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ and taste-evoked $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ responses were observed between wild-type and $Calhm1^{-/-}$ type II cells (Fig. 4i–k). Furthermore, $Calhm1$ deficiency had no effect on $I_{\mathrm{Na}}$ (Fig. 4f), TRPM5 expression in type II cells (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Figs 1i and 2) or the ATP content of taste buds (Supplementary Fig. 10). Strikingly, however, taste-evoked release of ATP from circumvallate papillae was abolished in $Calhm1^{-/-}$ mice (Fig. 4l and Supplementary Fig. 11). This strongly suggests that CALHM1 contributes to the major ATP-release mechanism in sweet/bitter/umami-sensing taste bud cells (Fig. 4l, m).

Our study sheds light on a novel cellular ATP-releasing mechanism by demonstrating that CALHM1 is a voltage-gated ion channel that mediates tetrodotoxin-sensitive ATP release in taste buds (Fig. 4l) as an essential mechanism of sweet, bitter and umami taste perception. As such, CALHM1 provides a missing link in the signal-transduction cascade in type II cells, connecting taste receptor activation and the generation of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ action potentials to the activation of afferent gustatory neural pathways ${ }^{1}$ (Fig. 4m). It has not escaped our attention that other CALHM isoforms ${ }^{6}$ as well as pannexin 1 and connexins are also present in taste buds ${ }^{9,12,13}$ and might also be involved in ATP release in taste, perhaps acting in parallel with or in a complex with CALHM1. Signalling by extracellular ATP is a widespread phenomenon that regulates many physiological activities ${ }^{19}$, including neurotransmission ${ }^{20,21}$, intercellular communication ${ }^{22,23}$, vascular tone ${ }^{24}$ and sensory transduction ${ }^{5,25-27}$. CALHM1 and its isoforms may participate in physiologically important ATP release elsewhere.

# METHODS

**Calhm1<sup>−/−</sup> mice.** Calhm1<sup>+/−</sup> founder mice were generated at genOway (Lyon, France) as described previously². Briefly, *Calhm1* exon 1 deletion was performed by homologous recombination in 129Sv embryonic stem cells. Positive clones were screened by PCR and confirmed by Southern blot analysis. The resultant embryonic stem cells were injected into blastocysts derived from C57BL/6J mice to obtain chimaeric mice that possessed germline transmission of the targeted *Calhm1* locus. Mice on the mixed 129Sv × C57BL/6J genetic background were used in this study. Wild-type (+/+) and *Calhm1* knockout (−/−) mice of F₁ obtained from littermate mice were used for two-bottle preference tests. All other experiments were performed with wild-type and knockout littermates. In some mice, the neomycin cassette was removed and the resulting strain was backcrossed with C57BL/6J mice. Briefly, *Calhm1*<sup>+/−</sup> mice were mated with mice bearing an *EIIa-cre* transgene (B6.FVB-Tg (EIIa-cre)C₅₇₉Lmgd/J, The Jackson Laboratory) on the C57BL/6J background to remove the neomycin resistance cassette by *cre*-loxP-mediated excision. The resulting *Calhm1*<sup>+/−</sup> pups were further backcrossed to C57BL/6J (The Jackson Laboratory) for at least five generations before being made homozygous. The removal of the neomycin cassette was confirmed by PCR. Backcrossed mice were used for two-bottle preference tests. Loss of CALHM1 expression in *Calhm1*<sup>−/−</sup> taste buds was verified by reverse-transcription (RT)-PCR and *in situ* hybridization.

**Laser capture microdissection, RNA amplification and RT-PCR.** Circumvallate taste tissue from *Calhm1*<sup>+/+</sup> and *Calhm1*<sup>−/−</sup> mice was embedded in cryo-molds using OCT freezing medium. Twelve micrometre-thick tissue sections were cut on a Leica CM1850 cryostat (Leica Microsystems), collected on RNase-free membrane slides (Leica) and stained with cresyl violet. Taste buds from the CVP and surrounding lingual epithelium were isolated using a Leica laser microdissection system LMD7000 (Leica). Taste buds and surrounding epithelium were pooled from a total of four mice of each genotype. Total RNA from taste bud and lingual epithelium samples was purified using a RNaseous-Micro Kit (Ambion). Total RNA was amplified using two sequential rounds with MessageAmp II aRNA kit (Ambion), as per the manufacturer’s instructions. One microgram of RNA was transcribed into complementary DNA (cDNA) using Invitrogen’s SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis System for RT–PCR with random hexamers, according to the supplied protocol. A 50-µl PCR reaction was run with the following final concentrations: 450 ng of each primer (see Supplementary Table 4 for PCR primer sequences), 2 mM MgCl₂, 0.3 mM dNTPs, 2.5 U Taq polymerase (Promega GoFlex DNA polymerase) and 1 µl of 10 ng µl⁻¹ DNA. PCR cycling conditions used for *Calhm1*: 95 °C for 3 min; 35 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 65 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 45 s; 72 °C for 7 min; 4 °C (hold).

**In situ hybridization.** Oral epithelia containing taste buds were dissected from adult male mice deeply anaesthetized with an overdose of sodium pentobarbital (Abbott Laboratories) and embedded in the frozen OCT compound (Sakura Finetech USA). Fresh-frozen sections of 8-µm thickness were prepared using a cryostat (CM3050S, Leica Microsystems). The *in situ* hybridization procedure was described previously²⁸. In brief, digoxigenin- and fluorescein-labelled antisense RNAs prepared using RNA labelling mix (Roche Diagnostics) and an RNA polymerase (Stratagene) were used for hybridization after fragmentation under alkaline conditions to a length of about 150 bases. Fresh-frozen sections were fixed with 4% PFA, treated with diethylpyrocarbonate, prehybridized with salmon sperm DNA for 2 h at 65 °C and hybridized with antisense riboprobes for 40 h at 65 °C. For single labelling of *Tas2r108* and *Trpm5*, however, prehybridization and hybridization were carried out at 58 °C. After hybridization, the sections were washed in ×0.2 SSC at 58 °C or 65 °C and blocked with 0.5% blocking reagent (Roche Diagnostics) in Tris-buffered saline. Chromogenic signals, except those from *Calhm1*, were developed for one day using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-digoxigenin antibody (1:500, Roche Diagnostics) and 4-nitro blue tetrazolium chloride/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-phosphate as chromogenic substrates. Chromogenic *Calhm1* signals were developed for two days to clarify the cells expressing *Calhm1* messenger RNA. No *Calhm1* signal was observed in *Skn-1* or *Calhm1* knockout taste tissues after signal development for three days. Stained images were obtained with a Nikon Eclipse 80i microscope (Nikon Instruments Inc.) equipped with a DXM1200C digital camera (Nikon). Fluorescent signals were developed using biotin-conjugated anti-fluorescein antibody (1:500, Vector Laboratories), avidin-biotin complex (Vector Laboratories), tyramide signal amplification biotin system (1:50, PerkinElmer) and Alexa 488-conjugated streptavidin (4 µg ml⁻¹, Invitrogen). Fluorescent images were obtained with a Leica SP2 confocal scanning microscope (Leica). For double labelling of *Calhm1* with *Trpm5* and *Tas1r3*, fluorescent signals were first developed and obtained, then chromogenic signals were developed and obtained as described above, and finally the images were superimposed using Photoshop CS3 (Adobe). RNA probes generated were to nucleotides 1–894 of *Tas2r108* (GenBank accession number, AF227148), nucleotides 310–3,491 of *Trpm5* (accession number, AF228681), nucleotides 525–2,725 of *Tas1r3* (accession number, AF337039), and nucleotides 1–1,407 and 2,148–2,369 of *Calhm1* cDNA fragment, which contains 1,047 base pairs of the entire coding sequence and 1,322 base pairs of 3′-non-coding region.

**Immunofluorescence staining.** For fixed-tissue preparation, mice 12 weeks old or older were anaesthetized with an overdose of sodium pentobarbital (Abbott Laboratories) and transcardially perfused with ice-cold PBS followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in ice-cold PBS. Tongue epithelia containing CVP were dissected and postfixied with the same fixative at 4 °C overnight. Tissue samples were then cryoprotected in 30% sucrose in PBS, embedded in frozen OCT compound (Sakura Finetech) and sectioned using a cryostat (CM1900, Leica Microsystems) at 8 µm. Tissue sections were mounted on tissue-adhesive-coated glass slides (Fisher Scientific) and stored at −80 °C until analysed. For immunofluorescence staining, slides were rinsed with PBS, incubated in a preheated target retrieval solution (S1700, Dako) at 80 °C for 20 min, allowed to cool to room temperature (20–25 °C) for 20 min, still in the target retrieval solution, and washed in PBS for 3 × 10 min. After blocking by 1-h incubation in PBS containing 5% normal donkey serum (PBS-5% NDS) at room temperature, sections were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies diluted in PBS-5% NDS: 1:3,000 for rabbit anti-TRPM5 (Alomone Labs); 1:500 for rabbit anti-PLCB2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); 1:500 for rabbit anti-AADC (Gene Tex); 1:500 for goat anti-KCNQ1 (Santa Cruz). The next day, the slides were washed for 3 × 10 min in PBS at room temperature and incubated for 1 h with Alexa-Fluor-conjugated antibodies diluted in PBS-5% NDS: 1:500 for Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-rabbit IgG; 1:500 for Alexa Fluor 568 anti-goat IgG (Invitrogen). Finally, slides were washed for 3 × 10 min in PBS at room temperature and mounted in VectaShield with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (H-1500, Vector Laboratories). Stained sections were imaged with a confocal scanning microscope (LSM 710, Carl Zeiss).

**Single-taste cell analyses.** Circumvallate taste epithelium was enzymatically delaminated, taste buds were collected from peeled epithelium and dissociated single-taste cells were collected, all as detailed previously²⁹. For patch clamp and fura-2 Ca²⁺ imaging experiments, isolated cells were placed on poly-L-lysine-coated coverslips and allowed to settle for 30–60 min.

Total RNAs isolated from taste buds and from adjacent non-taste epithelium were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. Individual dissociated taste cells from PLCB2-GFP (type II) and GAD1-GFP (type III) transgenic mice were selected for collection on the basis of their expression of GFP, as previously described³⁰. Type I taste cells were selected from PLCB2-GFP × GAD1-GFP double-transgenic mice by the absence of GFP expression³⁰. Total RNA isolated from taste cells was either subjected to T7 RNA polymerase-based linear amplification (aRNA, Message BOOSTER kit, Epicentre) or was directly converted to cDNA, both as previously described²⁹. For aRNA-based analyses, 1% of the resulting cDNA was used as template for PCR. For direct RT–PCR, 15% of cDNA from each cell was used to test for diagnostic messenger RNAs and 30% was used for *Calhm1*. PCR conditions with HotStarTaq Plus (QIAGEN) were 95 °C for 5 min followed by 45 90-s cycles, each of which comprised three 30-s components, one at 94 °C, one at the annealing temperature and one at 72 °C. PCR primers, annealing temperatures and product sizes were as in Supplementary Table 4. Two different primer sets were used for *Calhm1* (Supplementary Table 4). Primers 1 and 2 were used for RT–PCR on bulk tissue RNA, as well as for aRNA from individual taste cells (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 3a, b, d). Primers 3 and 4 span an intron, and were used for the single-cell direct RT–PCR to avoid amplifying from genomic DNA (Supplementary Fig. 3c). The cell type of all single cells and pools of cells was confirmed by RT–PCR for three diagnostic cell-type markers: *Entpd2* (type I), *Plcb2* (type II) and *Snap25* (type III).

**Two-bottle preference tests.** *Calhm1*<sup>−/−</sup> and wild-type control mice were presented for 48 h with two drinking bottles, one containing water and the other a solution supplemented with ascending concentrations of the specific taste compounds to be tested. All solutions were prepared with tap water and served at room temperature. Mice had *ad libitum* access to a standard chow diet (Laboratory Rodent Diet 5001, LabDiet, PMI Nutrition International) and drinking solutions. Two independent groups of mice were tested for the following series of taste solutions. The order of testing was as follows: sucrose, saccharin, NaCl, denatonium benzoate, quinine, HCl and MSG (group 1); MSG, quinine, HCl (group 2). Sucrose, saccharin, denatonium benzoate, quinine sulphate and MSG were from Sigma-Aldrich. HCl and NaCl were from Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. The order of stimulus presentation was identical for wild-type and knockout mice. The mice had three days with a single bottle of drinking water between each test series. The two bottles were switched after 24 h to control for a possible effect of the bottle positions. The change in liquid levels was considered to be the mouse’s liquid intake³¹. Fluid intakes were measured volumetrically to the nearest 0.1 ml. The volumes of water and taste compound solutions consumed were recorded. Solution preference was calculated as the intake of taste solution divided by total liquid intake, and this ratio was expressed as a percentage. The taste compounds were chosen as exemplars of the

sweet, bitter, umami, salty and sour taste qualities, and their concentrations were chosen to span the range between indifference and marked acceptance (for sucrose, saccharin and MSG) or avoidance (for quinine sulphate, denatonium benzoate, NaCl and HCl). Results were analysed by mixed-design analyses of variance with factors of group (wild type or Calhm1⁻/⁻) and concentration. Differences between the groups in consumption of specific concentrations of taste solution were determined using Bonferroni post hoc tests. Differences in response of each group to individual concentrations of test compounds relative to water were determined using Student’s t-test. Results presented in Fig. 2a are representative examples taken from the more comprehensive concentration functions displayed in Supplementary Fig. 4a and Supplementary Tables 1 and 2.

**Brief-exposure gustometer tests.** Acceptance of taste solution was assessed with brief-exposure tests using procedures similar to those used by other groups¹¹,³²–³⁵.

Twelve Calhm1⁻/⁻ mice (5 male, 7 female) and 12 wild-type littermate controls (5 male, 7 female) were maintained in a vivarium at 23 °C on a 12 h:12 h light/dark cycle with lights off at 19:00. When not being tested, each mouse was housed alone in a plastic ‘tub’ cage (26.5 cm × 17 cm × 12 cm) with a stainless-steel grid lid and wood shavings scattered on the floor. The mouse ate pelleted AIN-76A diet and drank deionized water according to the regimen described below. Throughout the experiment, each mouse was weighed daily, immediately before it was placed into a gustometer.

Brief-exposure taste acceptance was assessed using three MS160-Mouse gustometers manufactured by DiLog Instruments. Each gustometer consists of a 14.5 cm × 30 cm × 15 cm test chamber with a motorized shutter that controls access to a taste solution. Bottles of taste solution are mounted on a rack that is precisely positioned by a stepper motor so that any one of eight different taste solutions can be presented to the mouse. The drinking spout of each bottle is part of a high-frequency alternating current contact circuit so that each lick the mouse makes is detected and recorded. Details of construction and other technical information is available elsewhere³⁴,³⁶. Taste compounds were reagent grade and were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and dissolved in room-temperature deionized water. Deionized water was used as the water (0 concentration) and for ‘washout’ trials (see below). To avoid any undue influence of subtle differences among the three gustometers we used, we ensured that each mouse was always tested with the same gustometer and that equal numbers of wild-type and Calhm1⁻/⁻ mice were tested with each gustometer.

To train the mice to sample taste solutions, they were first deprived of water for 22.5 h and then placed in a gustometer with its shutter open. During this first training session, each mouse had continuous access to water for 25 min from the time it first licked the drinking spout. It was then returned to its home cage and given water for 1 h. During the following two days, this procedure was repeated, except the shutter allowing access to water was closed 5 s after each time the mouse began to lick, and was re-opened after a 7.5-s interval. Once again, after 25 min, the mouse was returned to its home cage and given water for 1 h. By the second test using these procedures, all except one wild-type and one Calhm1⁻/⁻ mouse had learned to obtain water during the 5-s access periods. We continued to test the two non-responders and they began to drink during the third or fifth test session (see below).

The mice received two test sessions with each of the 11 compounds presented in Supplementary Fig. 4b. These were presented in two cycles, with exemplars of the four basic tastes in the first cycle (sucrose, quinine hydrochloride, HCl and NaCl) and the other compounds in the second cycle. Only one taste compound was used during a session (see below) and there was only one session per day. The deprivation regimen used to investigate the response to sucrose, saccharin and Polycose differed from that used to investigate the response to the other taste compounds because these are hedonically positive and the other three compounds are hedonically negative³⁴. Prior to a session with a hedonically positive compound, each mouse received free access to food and water for 24 h. It then received 1 g of food and 2 ml of water, and the session began 24 h later. After these sessions, the mouse had a recovery day with free access to food and water for 24 h. Its water was then removed for 22.5 h to prepare it for the next session. After sessions with hedonically negative compounds, each mouse received water for 1 h in its home cage and it was then deprived of water in preparation for the next session. All sessions lasted 25 min. When hedonically positive compounds were being investigated, the session began with a single test of the highest concentration available to kindle the mouse’s interest in the drinking spout. After this, repeated series of five concentrations (including water) were presented, in a quasi-random order (a concentration could appear only once in a series of five tests). For each exposure, the shutter was open for 5 s, during which licks of the drinking spout were counted. This was followed by 7.5 s with the shutter closed, during which a new taste solution was positioned, ready for the next presentation. For sessions with hedonically negative compounds, repeated series of five or six concentrations (including water) were presented in randomized order. Additional 1-s washout trials with water were interposed between test trials. Thus, a mouse received access to a taste solution for 5 s followed by 7.5 s with the shutter closed, then access to water for 1 s followed by 7.5 s with the shutter closed, followed by the next taste solution for 5 s, and so on. We think the brief washout trials with water have the effect of cleansing the mouse’s palate and thus prevent it from quitting because it expects only bad-tasting solutions.

Separate analyses were conducted for each taste compound. The mean number of licks by each mouse in response to each concentration was obtained by averaging the results of identical exposures. These values for individual mice were then used in mixed-design analyses of variance with factors of group (wild type or Calhm1⁻/⁻) and concentration. Mice that did not respond during any presentation of a particular concentration of a taste compound were not included in statistical analyses of that compound. Post hoc least-significant difference tests were used to assess between-group differences in consumption of specific concentrations of taste solution and differences in the response of each group to individual concentrations of each taste compound (STATISTICA 10, Stat Soft Inc.). All analyses were conducted using a criterion for significance of P < 0.05. Results presented in Fig. 2b are representative examples taken from the more comprehensive concentration functions displayed in Supplementary Fig. 4b and Supplementary Table 3.

**Whole-chorda-tympani nerve recordings.** The mice were anaesthetized with an intramuscular injection of a mixture of 1.75 mg ml⁻¹ ketamine and 1.75 mg ml⁻¹ xylazine in saline (5 μl g⁻¹ body weight). Anaesthesia was maintained with 0.4–0.6% isoflurane. Body temperature, surgical table temperature, blood oxygen, anaesthesia level and heart rate were continuously monitored. The chorda tympani nerve was dissected free from its junction with the lingual nerve to the tympanic bulla, where the central part of the chorda tympani was cut and the peripheral part then mobilized in the rostral direction so that afferent nerve impulses could be recorded. The nerve impulses were recorded between a silver wire electrode and an indifferent electrode touching the walls of the wound, fed into a custom-made amplifier and monitored over a loudspeaker and an oscilloscope. The nerve impulses were processed by a smoothed absolute value circuit integrator³⁷ and rectified to a d.c. potential whose amplitude was related to the nerve impulse frequency, here called the summated signal. This signal and a code related to the kind of taste compound used were fed into an oscilloscope and computer. Both the individual nerve impulses and the summated signal were recorded (Gould ES 1000). The stimuli were delivered to the tongue with an open flow system controlled by the computer under conditions of constant flow and temperature³⁷ (33 °C). Each stimulation lasted for 5 s with 50-s rinsing time between stimulations. Care was exercised to make sure that the flow was directed over the fungiform papillae. In each animal, we strived to run the same sequence of stimuli at least three times while we recorded the nerve impulses from the whole chorda tympani nerve. The integrated response during stimulation was calculated by subtracting the area of nerve activity preceding stimulation from that during stimulation. Thus, the data reflect the level of activity during stimulation time. The responses to all compounds were expressed relative to the response to 0.1 M NH₄Cl in each mouse. The average in each animal and group was calculated, the variance determined and the significance between the chorda tympani responses of Calhm1⁻/⁻ and wild-type mice determined. P < 0.05 was considered significant.

**Cell culture.** HeLa cells (American Type Culture Collection) were grown in plastic flasks at 37 °C in a humidified incubator in culture medium containing 90% (v/v) DMEM, 10% fetal bovine serum and ×1 Antibiotic-Antimycotic (Invitrogen) with 5% CO₂-in-air.

**ATP measurements using cultured cells.** Extracellular ATP concentration was measured by the luciferin–luciferase reaction as previously described³⁸. HeLa cells were seeded onto 96-well microplates (Corning Costar) at a density of 10,000 cells per well one day before transfection. Cells in each well were transfected with 0.2 μg of hCALHM1 cDNA, mouse CALHM1 cDNA or empty vector (pIRES2.EGFP) using 0.4 μl Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. After 20–30 h, media were removed and cells were incubated for 1 h before 75 μl of the 100-μl bath solution containing 2 mM Ca²⁺ was replaced with an equal volume of test solution to establish final [Ca²⁺]₀ and drug concentrations. The plate was immediately placed in a microplate luminometer (Synergy 2, BioTEK) and 10 μl of ATP assay solution (FL-AAM and FL-AAB, Sigma-Aldrich) was dispensed into each well. ATP release was measured every 2 min. ATP concentration was calculated from a standard curve created in each plate. Separate standard curves were made in experiments involving all added drugs at the concentrations used. The bath solution contained (in mM) 150 NaCl, 5 KCl, 10 HEPES and 10 glucose, pH 7.4, adjusted with NaOH. [Ca²⁺]₀ values below 90 μM were achieved by mixing CaCl₂ and EGTA, and free [Ca²⁺]₀ was calculated using WEBMAXC software (http://maxchelator.stanford.edu). When a drug was tested, cells were pre-incubated for 1 h with the drug before being exposed to low-

[Ca²⁺]₀ solution containing the same drug. The high-[K⁺]₀ condition (117.5 mM) was established by replacing Na⁺ with equimolar K⁺.

**ATP measurements using intact taste buds.** Taste-evoked ATP release from intact taste buds was recorded with sheets of lingual epithelium as described previously⁵. The tongue epithelium was cut into pieces containing the CVP or lingual epithelium devoid of taste buds and mounted in a custom Ussing-type chamber that separated the fluid-containing serosal chamber from the apical surface. The apical surface was selectively exposed to a bitter mix (40 mM denatonium benzoate, 1 mM cycloheximide, 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4) for 45 s. The serosal fluid (130 μl) was then collected and added to an equal volume of ATP assay solution (FL-AAM and FL-AAB, Sigma-Aldrich) to determine its ATP content by the luciferin–luciferase assay. The solution on the serosal side contained (in mM) 150 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1.5 CaCl₂, 1 MgCl₂, 10 HEPES and 10 glucose, pH 7.4, adjusted with NaOH.

**Single-cell Ca²⁺ imaging.** Isolated taste cells on coverslips were secured in a perfusion chamber and mounted on the stage of an inverted microscope (Nikon Eclipse TE2000). Cells were loaded with fura-2AM (Molecular Probes; 2.5 μM) for 45 min at room temperature in the bath solution containing (in mM) 150 NaCl, 5 KCl, 2 CaCl₂, 1 MgCl₂, 10 HEPES and 10 glucose, pH 7.4, adjusted with NaOH. Cells were continuously perfused with the bath solution and stimulated for 30 s by bath perfusion of taste mix (2 mM saccharin, 100 μM SC45647, 1 mM denatonium, 10 μM cycloheximide; dissolved in the bath solution at pH 7.4). Fura-2 was alternately illuminated at 340 or 380 nm, and the emitted fluorescence intensity at 510 nm was collected with a PerkinElmer Ultraview imaging system. The background fluorescence was estimated for a region without cells and subtracted during analysis. Changes in [Ca²⁺]i are presented as changes in fluorescence ratio (F340/F380). Dye calibration was achieved by applying experimentally determined constants to the equation [Ca²⁺] = Kdβ(R - Rmin)/(Rmax - R). Macros used for analysis were custom macros written for IGOR PRO (WaveMetrics). Isolated taste bud cells that responded to a taste stimulus by robust [Ca²⁺]i increase were identified as type II cells: 24% of wild-type cells (9 out of 38 cells from three animals) and 39% of *Calhm1*⁻/⁻ cells (12 out of 31 cells from four animals).

**Single-cell electrophysiology.** Whole-cell recordings were made in single taste bud cells isolated from *Calhm1*⁻/⁻ and wild-type littermates and TRPM5-GFP mice with a patch-clamp amplifier (Axopatch 200B, Axon Instruments). TRPM5-GFP mice were a gift from Dr R. F. Margolskee³⁹ and were used for selective recordings from type II cells on the basis of their expression of GFP. The pipette solution contained (in mM) 155 CsF, 2 MgCl₂, 1 CaCl₂, 11 EGTA, 10 HEPES, pH 7.3, adjusted with methanesulphonic acid, ~308 mOsm. The bath solution contained (in mM) 140 Na⁺, 5.4 K⁺, 10 TEA⁺, 20 sucrose, 1.5 Ca²⁺, 1 Mg²⁺, 6 Cl⁻ and 10 HEPES, pH 7.4, adjusted with methanesulphonic acid, ~330 mOsm. Patch pipettes were fabricated from thick-walled borosilicate glass capillaries (PG10150-4, World Precision Instruments) and had a resistance of 5–9 MΩ in the recording condition. Electrode capacitance was compensated electronically, and 70% of series resistance (10–25 MΩ) was compensated with a lag of 20 μs. Currents were low-pass-filtered at 5 kHz with eight-pole Bessel characteristics and sampled at 10 kHz. For testing pharmacological properties of *I*slow in type II cells (Fig. 4h), whole-cell currents were recorded in GFP-positive taste cells isolated from TRPM5-GFP mice and *I*slow was evoked every 5 s by a voltage pulse to +100 mV with 1-s duration from a holding potential of –70 mV. Current amplitudes were taken at the end of the pulse and normalized to the average of values before drug addition (initial 50 s) for each cell.
