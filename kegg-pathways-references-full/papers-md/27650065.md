Abstract

The G-protein-coupled receptor APJ and its endogenous ligand apelin are widely expressed in many peripheral tissues and central nervous system, including adipose tissue, skeletal muscles and hypothalamus. Apelin/APJ system, involved in numerous physiological functions like angiogenesis, fluid homeostasis and energy metabolism regulation, is notably implicated in the development of different pathologies such as diabetes and its complications. Increasing evidence suggests that apelin regulates insulin sensitivity, stimulates glucose utilization and enhances brown adipogenesis in different tissues associated with diabetes. Moreover, apelin is also involved in the regulation of diabetic complications via binding to APJ receptor. Apelin improves diabetes-induced kidney hypertrophy, normalizes obesity-associated cardiac hypertrophy, and negatively promotes retinal angiogenesis in diabetic retinopathy. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview about the role of apelin/APJ system in different tissues related with diabetes. Furthermore, we describe the pathogenesis of diabetic complications associated with apelin/APJ system. Finally, agonists and antagonists targeted to APJ receptor are described in the literature. Thus, we highlight apelin/APJ system as a novel therapeutic target for pharmacological intervention in treating diabetes and its complications.

# 1. Introduction

Apelin is a peptide known as the endogenous ligand of the G-protein-coupled receptor APJ, which displays several isoforms such as apelin-36, apelin-17, apelin-13 and the pyroglutamated form of apelin-13 [1, 2]. Apelin and APJ are widely expressed in the central nervous system and peripheral tissues including hypothalamus, adipose tissue and skeletal muscles [3]. Increasing evidence suggests that apelin regulates numerous physiological functions including fluid homeostasis, angiogenesis and energy metabolism [4-6]. Furthermore, apelin/APJ system is involved in the development of different pathologies including diabetes and diabetic complications [6-8].

Diabetes, a kind of metabolic diseases characterized by hyperglycemia, has been mainly caused by insulin resistance and insulin secretion dysfunction. These effects, which raise blood glucose, decrease insulin sensitivity and aggravate vascular injury, have resulted in the damage and dysfunction in various tissues. So far, diabetes can be well controlled by treating with insulin and hypoglycemic drugs. However, there is still not an effective breakthrough in existing research to prevent diabetes hyperglycemic-initiated chronic and functional failure, like diabetic complications. Thus, diabetes still maintains a high disability and mortality rate on account of the complicated and lethal complications [9, 10].

Nowadays, evidence has been increasing that apelin is closely related with diabetes mellitus and diabetic complications. Apelin stimulates glucose utilization in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue (AT) of insulin-resistant obese mice [11, 12], enhances brown adipogenesis and browning of white adipocytes in AT [13, 14] and normalizes diabetic-induced kidney hypertrophy and renal inflammation as well as albuminuria [15]. And, apelin is also a prerequisite factor for hypoxia-induced retinal angiogenesis [16]. In this review, we summarize the role of apelin/APJ

system in the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus and typical diabetic complications, including retinopathies, nephropathies and cardiovascular diseases. Moreover, drugs binding to APJ receptor are described in the literature. In conclusion, apelin/APJ system becomes a potential therapeutic target in treating diabetes and its complications.

2. Apelin's effects on different tissues associated with diabetes mellitus

2.1. Apelin/APJ system inhibits adipogenesis in adipose tissue

Brown adipose tissue (BAT) plays an important role in the improvement of energy metabolism and insulin sensitivity. Mediated by mitochondrial uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), brown adipocytes have the ability to uncouple oxidative metabolism of energy substrates from ATP synthesis, leading to mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and heat production [17]. However, excess accumulation of white adipose tissue (WAT) has opposite effects compared to BAT.

In chow-, high fat diet (HFD)-fed mice, chronic apelin-13 treatment increases UCP1 level and promotes body energy expenditure in BAT [13, 14]. Both in vitro and in vivo, apelin promotes brown adipocyte differentiation by increasing the expressions of brown adipogenic and thermogenic transcriptional factors via PI3k/Akt and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathways.

In addition, apelin raises the basal metabolic activity of brown adipocytes, as evidenced by the increased UCP1 and PGC1Î± expressions (regulators of mitochondrial biogenesis and thermogenic gene expression) [18]. Moreover, apelin treatment not only decreases WAT mass and serum triglyceride level, but also induces browning of white adipocytes in obese mice [19, 20]. The protein levels of UCP1, COX1 and PRDM16 (brown adipocyte markers) are elevated in apelin-treated WAT [18]. Therefore, apelin is able to enhance brown adipogenesis and the brown-like characteristics in
white adipocytes by increasing the expression of UCP1 (Fig. 1) [18].

The increased free fatty acids (FFA) release from adipocytes (i.e. lipolysis) is observed in obesity and diabetes frequently, which is a contributory factor to the development of insulin resistance [21].

As an adipokine, apelin plays a crucial role in the regulation of adipogenesis and lipolysis via binding with APJ receptor. Apelin suppresses adipogenesis through decreasing FFA release and inhibits lipolysis by AMPK dependent enhancement of perilipin expression in mature adipocytes [20]. In 3T3-L1 cells and isolated adipocytes, apelin suppresses isoproterenol-induced lipolysis through both Gq-AMPK-mediated Ser-565 hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) phosphorylation and Gi-PKA-mediated Ser-563 HSL de-phosphorylation pathways (Fig. 1) [19]. Moreover, mice deficient in apelin signaling results in increased abdominal adiposity and FFA levels [19]. However, in human AT, apelin has no significant effect on basal or isoproterenol-stimulated lipolysis, even though acute apelin stimulation induces AMPK phosphorylation [22].

In endotherms, prolonged cold or heat stress triggers a series of symptoms, such as hypothermia, elevation of core temperature, and severe rhabdomyolysis. Arterial-venous alignment contributes to thermoregulation during both cold and heat stress [23]. Interestingly, apelin which produced from arterial endothelial cells (ECs) induces chemotaxis of APJ-positive venous ECs to regulate arterioles and venules alignment in skin. Apelin or APJ mutant mice have abnormal arterial-venous (AV) alignment. Apelin/APJ signaling contributes to thermoregulation by countercurrent heat exchange between parallel arteries and veins [23].

### 2.2. Apelin stimulates mitochondrial biogenesis and FAO in skeletal muscle

Recently, there are studies indicate that apelin/APJ system correlates with diabetes-related metabolism disturbance in muscles. Mayeur et al. find that apelin/APJ system controls fetal and
neonatal glucose homeostasis, which apelin administration in mothers increases transplacental transport of glucose and in neonates increases glucose uptake in muscle [24]. Furthermore, apelin treatment contributes to improve insulin sensitivity by stimulating mitochondrial biogenesis, fatty acid oxidation (FAO) and glucose uptake in muscle [11, 12].

The activation of mitochondrial biogenesis in muscle plays a beneficial role on treatment of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes, while mitochondrial dysfunction exacerbates insulin insensitivity [25]. Chronic apelin treatment in obese and insulin-resistant mice increases the density of muscle mitochondria and suppresses adverse alterations in mitochondria ultrastructure of soleus muscle, usually increased in T2DM [12, 26]. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) has been highlighted as a key factor to promote FAO and glucose transport, in order to energy supply [27]. Simultaneously, mitochondrial respiratory capacity and mitochondrial biogenesis is increased in soleus of apelin-treated mice in the AMPK-dependent manner. Then, AMPK activation increases PGC1-Î± level and its downstream targets NRF1 as well as TFAM to initiate the replication and transcription of mitochondrial DNA (Fig. 1) [28]. Moreover, the action of apelin is blunted in mice expressing a muscle-specific inactive AMPK mutant.

Interestingly, both the aerobic type I muscle fiber ratio and the DNA copy number of mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase subunit 1 are found to be increased in apelin-transgenic HFD-fed mice, indicated that this increase is a result of a shift from type II to type I muscle fiber [14].

Simultaneously, apelin stimulates energy expenditure by increasing mitochondrial content and oxidative capacity in skeletal muscle. The higher mitochondrial biogenesis specifically observed in triceps from apelin-treated rats is accompanied with increases in the expression of PGC-1Î² but not PGC-1Î± [29]. Increases in mitochondrial enzyme activities, like citrate synthase, cytochrome c

oxidase (COX) and beta-hydroxyacyl coA dehydrogenase (Î²HAD), are used as markers of increased mitochondrial content [30]. Apelin treatment increases skeletal muscle mitochondrial content by activating citrate synthase, COX and Î²HAD, which is involved in the citric acid cycle, the respiratory chain as well as mitochondrial oxidative capacities, respectively [29].

Acylcarnitines (AcylCNs) represent byproducts of substrate catabolism arising from incomplete FAO, which are used to identify FAO dysregulation in diabetic animal models [31]. Increased intracellular acylcarnitines are observed in skeletal muscle from insulin-resistant rats, while lower levels of acylcarnitines would enhance insulin sensitivity in muscle [32]. Apelin treatment reduces the elevation of long-chain acylcarnitines level induced by insulin-resistant in soleus muscle, suggested that apelin treatment increases complete but not incomplete FAO in soleus (Fig. 1) [12]. Moreover, the apelin-treated improvement of oxidative capacity enhances insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in soleus [12]. Indeed, apelin stimulates glucose uptake in soleus muscle by endothelial nitric oxide synthase-(eNOS), AMPK, and Akt-dependent pathways (Fig. 1) [11]. In obese and insulin-resistant mice, apelin restores glucose tolerance and improves glucose utilization in insulin-sensitive tissues [11].

### 2.3. Apelin/APJ system inhibits insulin secretion in pancreas

The pancreatic islets are key regulators of metabolism, while failure of islet function accelerates the development of T2DM. In human and murine islets, apelin is predominantly expressed in both beta and alpha cells [33]. APJ receptor expression is found on the INS-1 clonal beta cells as well as on human and mouse islets [33]. In the acinar cells, pancreatic duct and islets cells, APJ receptor expression is also abundant [34]. The effect of apelin on pancreas mainly concentrates upon the inhibition of insulin secretion. The upregulation of apelin level is detected in beta cells of T2D db/db
mice [33]. Sorhede Winzell et al. investigate that apelin-36 inhibits glucose-stimulated insulin secretion both in vivo and in vitro via improving glucose homeostasis [35]. Moreover, apelin-13 is also shown to inhibit insulin secretion response to intravenous glucose or glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) on the pancreatic beta-cells via activating PI3-kinase-dependent phosphodiesterase 3B (PDE3B) and subsequently suppressing of cAMP levels (Fig. 1) [36]. In addition, glucose-induced insulin secretion is impaired significantly in islets of APJ deletion obese mice [37].

Long-term apelin treatment also significantly improves diabetes-induced reduction in pancreatic islet mass and insulin content [38]. These effects are correlated with an alleviation of endoplasmic reticulum stress by reducing the upregulation of PERK/IRE1Î±-CHOP signaling and normalizing the diabetes-induced alteration of AKT, ERK, and AMPK activations in the pancreas of diabetic mice [38, 39]. Recently, Han et al. report that APJ deletion in islet cells significantly reduces pancreatic islet density and beta-cell mass as well as impairs glucose clearance in both normal and obese mice. These results demonstrate that apelin/APJ system regulates pancreatic islet homeostasis and glucose tolerance in islet cell [37]. Interestingly, circulating apelin treatment inhibits the secretion of pancreatic juice via decreasing the pancreatic blood flow. In contrast to intravenous administration, intraduodenal apelin treatment led to stimulation of pancreatic juice secretion by duodenal CCK1-vagal nerves mechanism [34].

### 2.4. Apelin/APJ system in other diabetes-associated targets

Inappropriate angiogenesis is associated with adipose tissue dysfunction in obesity, which in turn increases type-2 diabetes risk. Recent studies show that apelin/APJ system involves in pathological angiogenesis. Apelin administration causes peripheral and coronary vasodilation [40] and enhances blood vessels diameter during angiogenesis [41]. Apelin inhibits the accumulation of adipose tissue by
promoting lymphatic and blood vessels integrity. Moreover, apelin also blocks the increase of vascular hyperpermeability induced by dietary fatty acids and then attenuates obesity [6].

Abnormal hypothalamic responses may induce large variations of liver functions, including over-activation of hepatic glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis as observed in type 2 diabetes [42]. Hypothalamic factors like apelin are implicated in the alteration of glucose homeostasis [43]. Higher central apelin concentration promotes fasted hyperglycemia in normal mice [43]. Drougard et al. also demonstrate that central apelin stimulates liver glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis via promoting hypothalamic reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and sympathetic nervous system-over-activation, leading to fasted hyperglycemia [44]. The activation of hypothalamic proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons by releasing Î±-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (Î±-MSH) decreases food intake [45]. Apelin is strongly colocalized with POMC and stimulate Î±-MSH release, suggesting central apelin is likely to regulate body weight homeostasis through stimulating Î±-MSH release [46]. Meanwhile, intracerebroventricular administration of apelin-13 inhibits food and water intake and respiratory exchange ratio in diet-induced obese (DIO) rats [47]. Thus, increased hypothalamic apelin levels are implicated in the control of glucose homeostasis and food intake in diabetes.

Figure 1. Overview of apelin-induced signaling pathways in different tissues associated with diabetes mellitus. Apelin inhibits lipolysis through both Gq-AMPK-mediated HSL phosphorylation and Gi-PKA-mediated HSL de-phosphorylation pathways in adipose tissue. Apelin-mediated mitochondria biogenesis is shown to be AMPK-PGC1Î± dependent in skeletal muscle. Apelin inhibits insulin secretion by reducing cAMP levels in pancreas.

3. Apelin/APJ system in diabetic complications

3.1. The effects of apelin/APJ system in diabetic nephropathy

Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is mainly due to metabolic disorders caused by hyperglycemia and hemodynamic perturbations. Increasing numbers of patients are suffering from this disease, and novel therapeutic approaches are urgently needed. APJ localizes in the glomeruli and blood vessels of

kidneys, and renal APJ expression is reduced in diabetic mice but increased after treatment with apelin [15]. Circulating apelin concentration is significantly higher in diabetes patients [48]. Moreover, apelin treatment not only suppresses diabetes-induced renal histological changes, including mesangial expansion, whole-kidney and glomerular hypertrophy, but also normalizes the diabetes-induced increase in renal inflammation and albuminuria [15]. These researches indicate that apelin/APJ system has protective effects on the development of diabetic nephropathy.

Oxidative stress, which is due to an imbalance between pro-oxidative pathways and anti-oxidant pathways, has been shown to play an important role in the development of diabetic nephropathy [49].

The anti-oxidant enzyme catalase is down-regulated in the kidney of diabetic rats. Catalase deficiency aggravates diabetic renal functions injury through peroxisomal dysfunction, which is effectively restored by catalase overexpression [50]. In cardiomyocytes, apelin ameliorates the ROS-dependent cardiac hypertrophy via the increase in the expression of catalase [51]. Similarly with cardiac effects, chronic apelin administration is also sufficient to reverse diabetic-associated downregulation of catalase in kidney cortex from diabetic mice, accompanied with ameliorative renal functions (Fig. 2) [15]. These results indicate that one of renoprotective effects about apelin/APJ system could be due to stimulation of anti-oxidant pathways on the diabetic kidney.

Similarly, chronic inflammation has emerged as a key etiology in the initiation of renal injury during diabetes [52]. Circulating contents of apelin are inversely correlated with inflammation markers, including IL6, TNFÎ±, and hsCRP, in patients with hemodialysis and in kidney allografts recipients [53, 54]. Administration of apelin inhibits diabetes-induced renal inflammation in different diabetic models [15, 55]. In diabetic Ove26 mice, apelin treatment dramatically reverses diabetes-induced renal inflammation, including increase of MCP1 and VCAM1 expression, NF-ÎºB

activation and elevation of monocyte infiltration (Fig. 2) [15]. Apelin treatment also inhibits diabetes-induced increase of macrophage infiltration and elevation of inflammatory factors MCP-1, ICAM-1 and iNOS in Akita mice [55]. Together, these studies show that apelin exerts anti-inflammatory properties in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy.

In addition, histone acetylation plays an important role in the regulation of inflammation. Increased histone acetylation is usually associated with inflammatory cytokines and chemokines gene activation. Apelin treatment inhibits diabetes- and high glucose-induces inflammation by inhibiting histone hyperacetylation in vivo and in vitro [55]. Moreover, apelin inhibits diabetes-induced histone hyperacetylation in the kidney by selectively elevating histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) level (Fig. 2). As we mentioned above, apelin/APJ system exerts a protective effect on the diabetic kidney in an anti-oxidant and anti-inflammation manner. However, Guo and colleagues proposes an oppositional opinion that apelin promotes the development of DN by inducing podocyte dysfunction and abnormal glomeruli angiogenesis [56]. Higher levels of apelin are detected in patients with type 2 diabetes and in the kidneys of type 2 diabetic mice [57]. Apelin exacerbates albuminuria and glomerular basement membrane thickening through aggravating podocyte permeability in DN kk-Ay mice [56]. In cultured podocytes, apelin/APJ impairs the proteasome by inhibiting cAMP which subsequently induced ER stress to aggravate the progression of DN [56]. In addition, apelin treatment facilitates abnormal vessel formation in diabetic glomeruli and increases the permeability of glomerular endothelial cells via the upregulation of VEGFR2 and Tie2 [57]. It is controversial that apelin/APJ system prevents or aggravates the progression of DN. Therefore, further investigation about apelin/APJ system in DN is still required to illuminate these inconsistent research findings.

3.2. Apelin stimulates angiogenesis in diabetic retinopathy

Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a severe complication of diabetes on account of diabetic microangiopathy. Clinically, the cases which have retinal neovascularization (RNV) in DR are called proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR), while the others called non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR). Abnormal release of angiogenic growth factors, including VEGF and GFAP, in the retina is regarded as a significant factor during pathogenesis of RNV [58, 59].

In clinical study, the apelin concentrations in the vitreous and fibrotic membranes of the patients with PDR are significantly higher than in controls [60]. Similarly, serum levels of apelin-13 in PDR patients are dramatically higher compared to T2DM individuals [61]. The increased apelin concentration is also observed in the retina of diabetic rats [62]. Moreover, an overexpression and colocalization with the endothelial marker CD31 and apelin is detected in the epiretinal membranes in PDR, indicated that apelin/APJ system could represent a promising therapeutic target during retinal neovascularization in PDR [60, 63]. Recently, apelin has been considered as an angiogenic factor in retinal vasculature [64]. Apelin administration significantly induces migration, proliferation and capillary-like tube formation of retinal endothelial cells in vitro, and stimulates retinal angiogenesis in vivo [64, 65]. Hypoxia is a potent stimulus for angiogenesis through activation of angiogenesis-related genes [66]. Retinal apelin expression is dramatically increased during the hypoxic phase in oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) mice [16]. Overexpression of apelin in OIR mice causes exuberant endothelial cell proliferation and pathological angiogenesis in the retina, while apelin deficiency hardly induces hypoxia-induced retinal angiogenesis [16, 67].

As a main fibrotic extracellular matrix protein, excessive deposition of collagen I contributes to fibrotic membranes formation, which often leads to serious visual loss [68]. In retinal pigment epithelial cells, exogenous apelin promotes collagen I expression via the PI3K/Akt and MEK/Erk

signaling pathways, suggested that apelin may play a profibrotic role in the development of PDR [65, 69]. Similarly, apelin promotes retinal muller cell proliferation and induces GFAP and VEGF expression in the retina of normal rats [62, 70]. Interestingly, treatment with APJ antagonist F13A markedly suppresses retinal gliosis and reverses the elevation of GFAP and VEGF expression in the retinas of diabetic rats [62].

Insufficient recruitment of pericytes resulted from rapid endothelial cell growth leads to endothelial hyperplasia and abnormal angiogenesis [71, 72]. The excessive expression of apelin in OIR mice stimulates proliferation of endothelial stalk cells through PI3K-Akt signaling. Moreover, inhibition of apelin signaling leads to increased pericyte recruitment and suppresses pathological angiogenesis in the retina of OIR mice [73]. Mechanistically, apelin knockdown promotes pericyte recruitment by induction of MCP-1 via Smad3 activation in endothelial cells, and is effective for suppressing abrupt angiogenesis (Fig. 2) [73].

As we mentioned above, apelin induces retinal angiogenesis, promotes endothelial cell proliferation and inhibits pericyte recruitment in the retinas. However, APJ antagonist F13A dramatically reverses diabetes-induced retinal gliosis and the elevation of angiogenic factors in the retinas. In conclusion, apelin/APJ system may offer a new therapeutic opportunity against diabetic retinopathy.

### 3.3. apelin alleviates diabetic cardiomyopathy

Microvascular insufficiency contributes to cardiac hypertrophy and aggravates heart dysfunction in diabetic cardiomyopathy [8]. The apelin peptides are considered among the most potent endogenous positive inotropic agents in human cardiac tissue [1, 74]. In vivo, apelin treatment promotes myocardial neovascularization and cardiac repair after myocardial infarction (MI) [75].

Sirtuin 3 (Sirt3), as a major mitochondrial deacetylase enzyme in heart, is known to improve

cardiac metabolisms, cardiac fibrosis and cardiac hypertrophy [75-77]. The improvement of

myocardial neovascularization and cardiac repair induced by apelin is accompanied with upregulated

Sirt3 levels in the ischemic heart [75, 78]. Furthermore, treatment with apelin alleviates diabetic

cardiomyopathy via increasing myocardial vascular density involving upregulation of Sirt3 signaling

pathway [79, 80]. Treatment with apelin attenuates high glucose-induced ROS formation and

endothelial cell apoptosis by activation of Sirt3, then ameliorates diabetic cardiomyopathy [79]. In

addition, apelin improves cardiac function in MI diabetic mice by the increases of Angs/Tie-2 and

VEGF/VEGFR2 expression, together with a significant increase in capillary and arteriole densities

[79].

The mobilization of bone marrow-derived endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) has been shown to

promote neovascularization. SDF-1a/CXCR4 axis is a key regulator for the mobilization of EPC from

bone marrow to the ischaemic heart [81]. Apelin-overexpressed bone marrow EPC improves cardiac

function recovery in post-MI mice via activating Sirt3 [78]. Overexpression of apelin mobilizes EPC

to ischaemic heart via SDF-1a/CXCR4 axis, then facilitated cardiac angiogenesis in MI diabetic mice.

Knockout of Sirt3 in EPC specifically abolishes apelin-mediated higher level of CXCR4/SDF-1a and

angiogenesis in high glucose-induced EPC and MI diabetic mice (Fig. 2) [80]. Acute injection of

apelin is able to ameliorate the defective glucose tolerance in high fat-induced insulin-resistant obese

mice and to increase glucose uptake in heart [11]. Treatment with apelin facilitates myocardial

glucose uptake and GLUT4 membrane translocation in C57BL6/J mice [82]. Apelin increases glucose

uptake in H9C2 cells by facilitating phosphorylation of the insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) in an

AMPK-dependent manner (Fig. 2) [82]. Following activation via tyrosine phosphorylation from the

insulin receptor, IRS-1 in turn activates several intracellular pathways, including PI3K/Akt, Grb-2/Sos

and Erk/MAP kinase pathways, to propagate the insulin-induced signal [83, 84]

These studies indicate that apelin increases neovascularization, glucose uptake and insulin sensitivity in cardiac myocytes, suggesting a therapeutic potential of apelin in cardiac dysfunction associated with diabetes.

Figure 2. Summary of apelin-mediated signaling pathways in different diabetic complications

Apelin reduces inflammation via both inhibiting histone acetylation and direct reversing diabetes-induced activation of NF-ÎºB in diabetic nephropathy; apelin stimulates stalk cell proliferation through PI3K-Akt signaling, and inhibits pericyte recruitment by regulating Smad3/MCP-1 level in diabetic retinopathy; apelin alleviates diabetic cardiomyopathy via increasing myocardial angiogenesis involving upregulation of Sirt3 signaling pathway.

4. Compounds that target the APJ receptor

4.1. Peptidic agonists and antagonists of APJ receptor

There are two natural endogenous ligands of APJ receptor named apelin and elabela [85, 86]. The predominant endogenous apelin include apelin-13, -17 and -36 as well as [PyrÂ¹] apelin-13. Recently, elabela, as a new endogenous ligand for APJ, is found in human embryonic stem cells, which encoding a conserved hormone of 32 amino acids [87, 88]. Besides that, other biosynthetic compounds targeted to APJ receptor are developed. All of these compounds are classified into two categories: peptidic compounds and non-peptidic compounds.

The first peptidic antagonist for APJ receptor is ALX 40-4C (AcNH-(d-Arg)9-COOH), a polypeptide composed of nine arginine residues [89]. ALX 40-4C, which bound to APJ with a lower affinity, partially inhibits APJ-dependent cell membrane fusion and prevents ligand-induced intracellular calcium mobilization and receptor internalization [90]. By bivalent ligand approach, Macaluso et al. design a cyclic analogue (cyclo(1â6)CRPRLC-KHcyclo(9â14)CRPRLC) that incorporates two RPRL monomer units of apelin linked through a spacer [91]. This peptide which contains critical apelin residues for binding to APJ displays antagonist activity in vivo and in vitro.

Moreover, this cyclic peptide is more protected from proteolytic degradation and possesses a longer half-life. Using molecular dynamics simulations, MM07 (cyclo[1â6]CRPRLCHKGPMPF), which has greater effects on vasodilator and cardiac output compared with apelin-13, is identified as a novel selective agonist of APJ [92].

Lee et al. detected a highly selective peptidic antagonist F13A by a mutation from the C-terminal phenylalanine of apelin-13 to alanine [93]. F13A exhibits similar binding affinity but has a function opposite that of natural apelin-13. Indeed, the effects of apelin-13-induced decrease in blood pressure

and splanchnic neovascularization were efficiently reversed after treatment with F13A [93, 94].

F13A treatment promotes hepatocyte proliferation and liver regeneration after hepatectomy by promoting the activation of Kupffer cells and increasing serum levels of TNF-Î± and IL-6 [95]. In addition, blocking apelin/APJ system with F13A inhibits tumor growth and the dilation of arteries in hepatocellular carcinoma model [96]. The same antagonism activity has been observed in diabetes-associated studies that F13A markedly reduces retinal gliosis caused by diabetes via binding to APJ receptor [62]. Moreover, F13A also suppresses diabetic retinopathy through inhibition of VEGF and GFAP with an APJ-dependent manner in diabetic rats [61, 62].

### 4.2. Non-peptidic agonists and antagonists of APJ receptor

In addition to peptidic agonists and antagonists of APJ receptor, several non-peptidic small molecule compounds also target the APJ receptor. Using high throughput screening, ML221, a kojic acid-based small molecule, is identified as the first non-peptidic antagonist for APJ [97]. ML221 blocks apelin-13-mediated cAMP production and Î²-arrestin recruitment to APJ by inhibiting the APJ receptor [97]. E339-3D6, a non-peptidic agonist for APJ, is discovered by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based assay in 2010 [98]. E339-3D6 induces intracellular cAMP production and APJ internalization compared with apelin-13. Moreover, E339-3D6 causes vasorelaxation of rat aorta ex vivo and inhibits systemic vasopressin release in vivo. Another small molecule APJ agonist ML233 provides a useful tool to promote Î²-arrestin recruitment to APJ and induce APJ receptor internalization [99]. As discussed above, numerous compounds are made up of APJ antagonists and agonists. These peptidic and non-peptidic compounds of APJ receptor have been completely described in Table 1. Further studies will be needed to determine whether these compounds targeted to APJ receptor are effective in the treatment of diabetes and diabetic complications.

optimization of structure, novel synthetic ligands for APJ receptor could develop into promising therapeutic anti-diabetes drugs.

5. Conclusion

This review summarizes the important role of apelin/APJ system in the pathogenesis of diabetes and diabetic complications. Apelin improves insulin sensitivity, stimulates glucose utilization and enhances brown adipogenesis in different tissues associated with diabetes. Additionally, apelin ameliorates diabetes-induced kidney hypertrophy, normalizes obesity-associated cardiac hypertrophy, and negatively promotes retinal angiogenesis in diabetic retinopathy.

The pathology of diabetes and its complications is rather intricate. In most cases, apelin/APJ system contributes to improve diabetes and its complication. However, apelin aggravates diabetic retinopathy by promoting retinal angiogenesis. Thus, the mechanism by which apelin/APJ system promotes or restricts the occurrence of diabetes and its complications is worthy of deeply investigation.

Furthermore, the effects of compounds targeted to APJ receptor are not complete and systematic, and need to be further explored. Much of existing research about these compounds targeted to APJ receptor is mainly based on cell experiments in vitro. Further studies in animals or even humans are needed. Thus, the apelin/APJ system should be considered as a potential target in the treatment of diabetes and its complications.
