## Abstract

Nectins are Ca${}^{2+}$-independent immunoglobulin (Ig)-like cell-cell adhesion molecules, which comprise a family consisting of four members. Nectins have five activities: (1) they show Ca${}^{2+}$-independent cell-cell adhesion activity by homo- and hetero-trans-interactions through their extracellular regions; (2) they bind afadin, an actin filament (F-actin)-binding protein, through their cytoplasmic tails and are connected to the actin cytoskeleton; (3) they induce activation of Cdc42 and Rac small G proteins through their cytoplasmic tails; (4) they bind Par-3, a cell polarity protein, through their cytoplasmic tails; and (5) they heterophilically trans-interact with Necls, nectin-like molecules, through their extracellular regions. Through these activities, nectins regulate a variety of cellular functions, including adhesion, migration, and polarization. Here we describe these activities and functions of nectins.

Keywords: cadherins; cell adhesion; cell migration; cell polarization; nectins; Necls.

## Introduction

Cells in multicellular organisms recognize their neighboring cells, adhere to them, and form cell-cell junctions/contacts that play essential roles in various cellular processes, including morphogenesis, differentiation, proliferation, and migration. There are two types of cell-cell junctions/contacts: homotypic ones found at adherens junctions between two neighboring epithelial cells; and heterotypic ones typically formed between differentiating germ cells and their supporter Sertoli cells in seminiferous epithelia in the testis. The term ‘cell-cell junction’ is defined here as an adhesion site heavily undercoated with the cytoskeleton, while ‘cell-cell contact’ is defined as that not heavily associated with the cytoskeleton. Cell-cell junctions/contacts are mediated by homo- and/or hetero-trans-interactions of cell adhesion molecules (CAMs). The cadherin superfamily consists of over 80 members and serves as key Ca${}^{2+}$-dependent CAMs (Takeichi, 1991; Yagi and Takeichi, 2000). Members of the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily also play important roles as Ca${}^{2+}$-independent CAMs (Brummen-dorf and Lemmon, 2001). The members of this family possess one or more copies of the Ig domains that are characteristic of antibody molecules. Recently, nectins have emerged as novel Ig-like CAMs, which play roles in cooperation with, or independently of, cadherins in a variety of cell-cell junctions/contacts (Takai and Nakanishi, 2003; Takai et al., 2003a). Nectins form a family of four members, nectin-1, -2, -3, and -4, and they share the common structure consisting of an extracellular region containing three Ig-like loops, a single transmembrane region, and a cytoplasmic tail. We describe here the activities and functions of nectins.

### Cell-cell adhesion activity

Nectins show Ca${}^{2+}$-independent cell-cell adhesion activity through their extracellular regions (Takai and Nakanishi, 2003; Takai et al., 2003a). Each nectin forms homo-cis-dimers (homo-cis-dimerizations), but not hetero-cis-dimers (hetero-cis-dimerizations) (Figure 1A). Homo-cis-dimers of each nectin then form homo-trans-dimers (homo-trans-interactions). Furthermore, hetero-trans-dimers are formed (hetero-trans-interactions) between nectin-3 and -1, nectin-3 and -2, and nectin-4 and -1, but not between nectin-2 and -1 (Figure 1C). These hetero-trans-interactions show much higher affinity than the homo-trans-interactions. The $K_{d}$ values of nectin-3 for nectin-1 and -2 are 2.3 nM and 360 nM, respectively, as estimated by surface plasmon resonance analysis (Ikeda et al., 2003). Binding activities of the homo-trans-interactions of nectins cannot be detected by this type of analysis. Separation force measurement analysis on paired cells using a dual pipette assay has revealed that the force of the hetero-trans-interactions between nectin-1 and -3 is about 3-fold stronger than that of the homo-trans-interactions of nectin-1 or -3, although it is much weaker than that of the homo-trans-interactions of E-cadherin (C. Martinez-Rico et al., unpublished data). On the other hand, single molecule intermolecular force microscopy has allowed us to measure the force required to disrupt a single trans-interaction of recombinant CAMs between two microbeads by separating the two microbeads under a range of loading rates (separation force per unit time). In this analysis, the force of the homo- and hetero-trans-interactions of nectins is higher than that of the homo-trans-interactions of E-cadherin when the loading rate is low, although the force of E-cadherin markedly increases, compared with that of nectins, in the case of high loading rate (Y. Tsukasaki et al., unpublished data). The second Ig-like loop

P-cadherin colocalize at AJs and are cooperatively involved in the formation of AJs. Mutations in the nectin-1 gene are responsible for cleft lip/palate-ectodermal dysplasia, Margarita island ectodermal dysplasia and Zlotogora-Oğur syndrome, which is characterized by cleft lip/palate, syndactyly, mental retardation, and ectodermal dysplasia (Suzuki et al., 2000; Sozen et al., 2001). Nectin-1-, -2-, or -3-deficient mice apparently do not show impaired organization of AJs and TJs in most tissues where various types of nectins are expressed (Takai and Nakanishi, 2003; M. Inagaki et al., unpublished data; N. Okabe et al., unpublished data; T. Honda et al., unpublished data; T. Yamada et al., unpublished data). This might be due to functional redundancy of each nectin in these tissues.

At the synapses between the mossy fiber terminals and the pyramidal cell dendrites in the CA3 area of the hippocampus of the brain, both synaptic junctions and puncta adherentia junctions are highly developed and actively remodeled in a neural activity-dependent manner (Amaral and Dent, 1981). Nectin-1 and -3 are localized asymmetrically at the presynaptic and postsynaptic sides, respectively, of the plasma membranes of the puncta adherentia junctions (Mizoguchi et al., 2002; Takai and Nakanishi, 2003; Takai et al., 2003b). N-Cadherin symmetrically localizes there and both nectins and N-cadherin are involved in the formation of the puncta adherens junctions. At the junctions between the apical membranes of pigmented and non-pigmental epithelia in the ciliary body of the eye, nectin-1 and -3 are present at both sides, whereas P-cadherin symmetrically localizes at both sides (M. Inagaki et al., unpublished data). Nectins and P-cadherin mediate the apex-apex adhesion between the pigmented and non-pigmental epithelia of the ciliary body. At the Sertoli cell-spermatid junctions, nectin-2 and -3 are specifically expressed in Sertoli cells and spermatids, respectively, and serve as essential CAMs (Ozaki-Kuroda et al., 2002; Takai and Nakanishi, 2003). At these junctions, cadherins do not function as major CAMs. Consistently, nectin-2-deficient mice exhibit severely impaired organization of the Sertoli cell-spermatid junctions, resulting in male-specific infertility and defects in sperm morphogenesis (Bouchard et al., 2000; Ozaki-Kuroda et al., 2002). At the contacts formed between commissural axons and the processes of floor plate cells in the neural tube, nectin-1 and -3 asymmetrically localize as key CAMs at the commissural axon side and the floor plate cell side, respectively, of the plasma membranes at their contact sites, and play an important role in the trajectory of the commissural axons (Okabe et al., 2004). At these contacts, cadherins do not serve as CAMs.

### Afadin-binding activity

Nectins, with the exception of nectin-4, have a conserved motif of four amino acid residues (Glu/Ala-X-Tyr-Val) at their carboxy-termini, and this region binds the PDZ domain of afadin, an actin filament (F-actin)-binding protein (Takai and Nakanishi, 2003; Takai et al., 2003a) (Figure 2). Although nectin-4 lacks the conserved motif,

Figure 2 Involvement of nectins in the formation of AJs and TJs in epithelial cells.

At AJs, E-cadherin serves as an essential CAM. The cytoplasmic tail binds β-catenin, which in turn binds α-catenin. α-Catenin is associated with circumferential F-actin bundles directly and indirectly through vinculin and α-actinin. Nectins also function as CAMs at AJs, but are more highly concentrated at AJs than E-cadherin. The cytoplasmic tails bind afadin that is directly associated with the F-actin bundles. Afadin and α-catenin are associated with each other through the three connector units, ponsin-vinculin, ADIP-α-actinin, and LMO7-α-actinin. At TJs, claudins and JAMs function as CAMs. Their cytoplasmic tails bind ZO-1, -2, and -3. ZO-1 and -2 are directly associated with F-actin bundles and form dimers with ZO-3. The cytoplasmic tails of JAMs furthermore bind Par-3 that forms a ternary complex with Par-6 and aPKC. Nectins also bind Par-3. Necl-2 localizes at the basolateral plasma membrane, excluding AJs and TJs. The trans-interactions of nectins induce activation of Cdc42 through c-Src and FRG. c-Src and Cdc42 furthermore induce activation of Rac through an unidentified GEF. The trans-interactions of E-cadherin induce activation of Rac, but not Cdc42. Cdc42 and Rac activated by nectins and E-cadherin organize the actin cytoskeleton through their effectors, NWASP, WASP, IQGAP, and IRSp53/WAVE. In addition, Cdc42 activated by the trans-interactions of nectins binds to Par-6.

It binds the PDZ domain of afadin at its carboxyl terminus. This binding links nectins to the actin cytoskeleton. The binding of nectins to afadin is necessary for nectins to cluster at cell-cell contact sites, but not for their cis-dimerizations or trans-interactions. There are two splicing variants, l- and s-afadin (Takai and Nakanishi, 2003; Takai et al., 2003a). l-Afadin, the larger variant, binds F-actin through its F-actin-binding domain. l-Afadin has two Ras-associated (RA) domains, a forkhead-associated (FHA) domain, a dilute (DIL) domain, and three proline-rich (PR) domains. Although l-afadin binds F-actin, it does not show an activity to cross-link F-actin. s-Afadin, the smaller variant, has the two RA domains, FHA domain, DIL domain, PDZ domain, and two PR domains, but lacks the F-actin-binding domain and the third PR domain.

Nectins are physically associated with cadherins, and both afadin and α-catenin are essential for this association (Takai and Nakanishi, 2003; Takai et al., 2003a) (Figure 2). Afadin directly binds α-catenin *in vitro*, but this interaction is not strong. The direct binding of these proteins may occur *in vivo*, but post-translational modification(s) of either or both proteins and/or an unidentified molecule(s) are likely to be required for the binding of α-catenin to afadin. Consistently, three putative connector units for nectins and cadherins have been identified. The first one is a ponsin-vinculin unit (Mandai et al., 1999). Ponsin is an afadin- and vinculin-binding protein and vinculin is an F-actin- and α-catenin-binding protein. However, ponsin does not form a ternary complex with afadin and vinculin. Ponsin may regulate the interaction between afadin and vinculin in cooperation with another unidentified factor. The second one is an afadin DIL domain-interacting protein (ADIP)-α-actinin unit (Asada et al., 2003). ADIP is an afadin- and α-actinin-binding protein and α-actinin is an α-catenin-binding protein. It is still unknown whether ADIP forms a ternary complex with afadin and α-actinin, as well as whether ADIP associates with the cadherin-catenin system through α-actinin. The third one is an LIM domain only 7 (LMO7)-α-actinin unit (Ooshio et al., 2004). LMO7 is also an afadin- and α-actinin-binding protein.

Thus, nectins and cadherins are associated through afadin, α-catenin, and their binding proteins and are cooperatively involved in the formation of AJs and the subsequent formation of TJs. This is also supported by

Figure 3 Mode of action of nectins in the formation of AJs and TJs in epithelial cells.

(A) Formation of AJs. a1, b1, and c1: side view. a2, b2, and c2: top view. Panels a1 and a2: nectins and E-cadherin are diffusely distributed on the free surface of the plasma membrane of migrating cells. When two migrating cells contact through their protrusions, nectins first form trans-dimers that generate micro-clusters at the cell-cell contact regions. The trans-interactions of nectins induce activation of Cdc42, resulting in an increase in the number of filopodia and cell-cell contact sites like 'Fork initiation'. Panels b1 and b2: the trans-interactions of nectins furthermore induce activation of Rac, resulting in expansion of lamellipodia between the filopodia. Panels c1 and c2: E-cadherin forms trans-dimers that generate micro-clusters at cell-cell contacts through the lamellipodia. The lamellipodia efficiently expand the cell-cell adhesion between the filopodia, and efficiently zip the cell-cell contact sites, so-called 'zipper'. Nectin- and E-cadherin-based AJs are finally formed.

(B) Formation of TJs. Panels a and b: during and/or after the formation of AJs, JAMs are first assembled at the apical side of AJs. Panel c: this is followed by the recruitment of claudins, which eventually leads to the establishment of the claudin-based TJs. Actin bundles and peripheral membrane proteins are omitted.

studies on afadin-deficient mice. Deficiency of afadin causes embryonic lethality (Ikeda et al., 1999; Takai and Nakanishi, 2003; Takai et al., 2003a). Afadin-deficient mice show developmental defects at stages around gastrulation, including disorganization of the ectoderm, impaired migration of the mesoderm, and loss of somites and other structures that are derived from both the ectoderm and the mesoderm. Furthermore, cystic embryoid bodies derived from afadin-deficient embryonic stem cells show disorganization of the ectoderm (Ikeda et al., 1999; Takai and Nakanishi, 2003; Takai et al., 2003a). In the ectoderm of afadin-deficient mice and embryoid bodies, organization of AJs and TJs is highly impaired.

## Small G protein-activating activity

The trans-interactions of nectins induce activation of Cdc42 and Rac small G proteins (Takai et al., 2003a; Shimizu and Takai, 2003) (Figure 2). It is unclear whether the trans-interactions of nectins induce activation of the small G protein Rho. On the other hand, the trans-interactions of E-cadherin induce activation of Rac, but not that of Cdc42 (Yap and Kovacs, 2003). Cyclical activation and inactivation of these small G proteins are regulated by three types of regulators: Rho GDP/GTP exchange factors (GEFs), Rho GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), and Rho GDP dissociation inhibitors (Takai et al., 2001). Nectins may induce either activation of GEFs, inactivation of GAPs, or both. A Cdc42 GEF, FRG, has recently been identified to be involved in the nectin-induced activation of Cdc42 (Fukuhara et al., 2004; Figure 2). The activation of FRG is mediated by c-Src. c-Src is recruited to the nectin-based cell-cell adhesion sites and locally activated there. c-Src then recruits and phosphorylates FRG. In addition, c-Src induces activation of Rap1 through the Crk-C3G complex (T. Fukuyama et al., unpublished data). Subsequently, Rap1 induces the activation of FRG, eventually resulting in the activation of Cdc42. The activation of c-Src and Cdc42 causes the activation of Rac, but the Rac GEF has not been identified (Figure 2). The binding of nectins to afadin is not essential for the activation of Cdc42 or Rac.

Cdc42 and Rac activated in these ways regulate the formation of AJs through reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton as described below (Takai et al., 2003a; Shimizu and Takai, 2003). In addition, Cdc42 and Rac induce activation of mitogen-activated kinase (MAP) cascades. Note that Cdc42 and Rac activated by the trans-interactions of nectins selectively induce activation of

c-Jun N-terminal kinase, but not p38 MAP kinase or extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) (Honda et al., 2003; Takai et al., 2003a). The reason for this selective activation is not known, but a possible explanation is intracellular compartmentalization of the MAP kinase pathways. Furthermore, Cdc42 and Rac regulate the formation of TJs and cell polarity through cell polarity proteins as described below (Takai et al., 2003a; Shimizu and Takai, 2003).

The mode of action in the formation of AJs in epithelial cells

The molecular mechanisms of the formation of cell-cell junctions have been most extensively investigated in epithelial cells. Available evidence suggests the following mechanism for the formation of AJs (Figure 3A): all CAMs are diffusely distributed along the plasma membrane of protrusions, such as filopodia and lamellipodia, of migrating cells. When two cells collide through these protrusions, nectins first form cell-cell adhesion where E-cadherin is recruited through many peripheral membrane proteins. On the other hand, nectins induce the activation of Cdc42 and Rac (Takai et al., 2003a; Shimizu and Takai, 2003; Fukuhara et al., 2003). Cdc42 activated in this way increases the number of filopodia and cell-cell contact sites (Vasioukhin et al., 2000; Takai et al., 2003a; Shimizu and Takai, 2003; Fukuhara et al., 2003). Rac activated by nectins induces the formation of lamellipodia. These lamellipodia efficiently gather up the cell-cell adhesion between the filopodia, acting like a ‘zipper’ (Yonemura et al., 1995; Adams et al., 1998; Vasioukhin et al., 2000; Ehrlich et al., 2002; Takai et al., 2003a; Shimizu and Takai, 2003). At the cell-cell contact sites mediated by the trans-interactions of E-cadherin, non-trans-interacting nectins inhibit the E-cadherin-induced activation of Rac and the subsequent formation of AJs, until eventually the non-trans-interacting nectins trans-interact with other nectin molecules and induce activation of Cdc42 (Hoshino et al., 2004). Many downstream effectors have been identified for Rac and Cdc42 (Takai et al., 2001; Takenawa and Miki, 2001). Some of these effectors are F-actin-binding proteins: IQGAP1 and IRSp53/WAVE for Rac; and IQGAP1, NWASP, and WASP for Cdc42 (Figure 2). Therefore, nectins regulate organization of the peripheral actin cytoskeleton in two different ways: one is organized by F-actin-binding proteins associated with nectins and E-cadherin, such as afadin, α-catenin, α-actinin, and vinculin; the other is organized by Cdc42 and Rac through their downstream effectors, the F-actin-binding proteins. The actin cytoskeleton reorganized in these ways facilitates the formation of AJs and strengthens the cell-cell adhesion. Consistently, the actin cytoskeleton is required for the association of nectins and E-cadherin through their peripheral membrane proteins in epithelial cells (Yamada et al., 2004). In contrast, the actin cytoskeleton is not essential for the association of nectins and cadherins in fibroblasts (Honda et al., 2003). The reason for this difference is not known, but it may be due to the difference in AJ structures between epithelial cells and fibroblasts: in epithelial cells, AJs are undercoated with F-actin bundles, forming belt-like structures, whereas in fibroblasts the belt-like structures are not developed.

Par-3-binding activity and the mode of action in the formation of TJs

Recent genetic studies have revealed that a set of polarity proteins, including Par-3, Par-6, and atypical protein kinase C (aPKC), is required for asymmetric cell division during development and apico-basal polarization of epithelial cells (Ohno et al., 2001). These three proteins directly interact with each other to form a ternary complex in epithelial cells (Figure 2). Moreover, the dynamic formation of this complex is essential for the formation of TJs. Par-3 binds to nectin-1 and -3, but not to nectin-2 (Takai et al., 2003a; Takekuni et al., 2003). The first PDZ domain of Par-3 binds to the carboxy-terminal four amino acids of nectin-1 and -3. Thus, nectin-1 and -3 bind both afadin and Par-3. In addition, Par-3 binds, through the first PDZ domain, to junctional adhesion molecules (JAMs) that are Ca²⁺-independent Ig-like CAMs at TJs (Ohno, 2001; Tsukita et al., 2001; Figure 2). Through this direct binding of Par-3 to JAMs, the Par-3/Par-6/aPKC complex localizes at TJs.

Nectins are involved not only in the formation of AJs but also in the formation of TJs and cell polarization (Takai and Nakanishi, 2003; Takai et al., 2003a). A proposed model for the mode of action of nectins in the formation of TJs and cell polarization is as follows (Figure 3B): during and/or after the trans-interactions of nectins recruit E-cadherin to form AJs, they recruit first JAMs and then claudins to the apical side of AJs in cooperation with cadherins, resulting in the formation of TJs. It currently remains unknown how the trans-interactions of nectins recruit the TJ components, but afadin and ZO-1 may play roles in recruiting the CAMs at TJs. The actin cytoskeleton is also required for the association of nectins with claudins and JAMs (Yamada et al., 2004). On the other hand, the trans-interactions of nectins induce activation of Cdc42, which binds to Par-6 (Figure 2). The GTP-Cdc42/Par-6 complex activates aPKC, and the GTP-Cdc42/Par-6/aPKC complex then forms a complex with Par-3, resulting in the activation of the polarity protein complex. The precise role of the binding of Par-3 to nectins remains unknown, but Par-3 may first bind to nectins before the recruitment of JAMs. After the trans-interactions of nectins recruit JAMs to the apical side of AJs and induce activation of Cdc42, which triggers the formation of the GTP-Cdc42/Par-3/Par-6/aPKC complex, the polarity complex may translocate from nectins to JAMs.

Necl-interacting activity

Five molecules possessing one extracellular region with three Ig-like loops, one transmembrane region, and one cytoplasmic tail have thus far been identified as a new family of CAMs (Takai et al., 2003a). They are called nec-tin-like molecules (Necls) on the basis of their domain

structure being similar to that of nectins. These include Necl-1/TSLL1/SynCAM3, Necl-2/IGSF4/RA175/ SgIGSF/ TSLC1/SynCAM1, Necl-3/ similar to Necl-3/SynCAM2, Necl-4/TSLL2/SynCAM4, and Necl-5/Tage4/poliovirus receptor/CD155. Of these Necls, Necl-1, -2, and -5 have been shown to heterophilically trans-interact with nectins (Figure 1, B and C). The properties of Necl-3 or -4 have not been studied so far.

Necl-1 shows Ca²⁺-independent homophilic cell-cell adhesion activity and Ca²⁺-independent heterophilic cell-cell adhesion activity with nectin-1 and -3, but not with nectin-2 (S. Kakunaga et al., unpublished data; Figure 1C). Necl-1 is specifically expressed in the neural tissue, where it localizes at the contact sites among axonal shafts, axon terminals, and glial cell processes that cooperatively form synapses, axon bundles, and myelinated axons (S. Kakunaga et al., unpublished data). Necl-1 is likely to serve as CAM at the non-junctional cell-cell contact sites of the brain. As described above, nectin-1 and -3 are involved in the formation of puncta adherens junctions between the mossy fiber terminal and pyramidal cell dendrites in the CA3 area of the hippocampus. Therefore, the ability of nectin-1 and -3 to trans-interact with Necl-1 suggests that Necl-1 may be recruited to the nectin-1 and -3-based cell-cell adhesion sites in the process of the formation of synapses. After Necl-1 is assembled to the primordial synapses, it may be translocated to the axonal shafts where Necl-1 may function to maintain axon bundle formation.

Necl-2 shows Ca²⁺-independent homophilic cell-cell adhesion activity and heterophilic cell-cell adhesion activity with nectin-3 (Biederer et al., 2002; Masuda et al., 2002; Shingai et al., 2003; Figure 1C). Necl-2 is widely expressed in various tissues and localizes at the basolateral plasma membrane, excluding the specialized cell-cell junctions, such as AJs, TJs, and desmosomes, of epithelial cells (Fukami et al., 2002; Shingai et al., 2003; Takai et al., 2003a). This unique localization pattern is quite different from those of any other known CAMs. Necl-2 has been shown to serve as a tumor suppressor in human non-small cell lung cancer (Kuramochi et al., 2001). Necl-2 binds tumor suppressor DAL-1, one of the band 4.1 family members, which connects Necl-2 to the actin cytoskeleton (Yageta et al., 2002). In addition, Necl-2 binds Pals2, a MAGUK family member known to bind Lin-7, implicated in the proper localization of the Let-23 protein in *Caenorhabditis elegans*, the homolog of mammalian epidermal growth factor receptor (Shingai et al., 2003). Furthermore, Necl-2 binds Dlg3/MPP3, another MAGUK family member (Masuda et al., 2002). Therefore, Necl-2 may be involved in localization of a transmembrane protein(s) through the MAGUK family members. However, little is known about the mechanism of the unique localization of Necl-2 at the basolateral plasma membrane, excluding the specialized cell-cell junctions. The ability of nectin-3 to trans-interact with Necl-2 suggests that Necl-2 may be recruited to the nectin-3-based cell-cell adhesion in the process of forming AJs (Takai et al., 2003a). Consistently, wound healing assays using MTD-1A cells have revealed that Necl-2 is assembled to the cell-cell adhesion sites at the very early stage together with nectins and E-cadherin (Shingai et al., 2003).

Necl-2 seems to be first assembled to the primordial cell-cell adhesion sites, and then translocated to the extrajunctional region of the basolateral plasma membrane. Nectins are confined to AJs undercoated with F-actin bundles and are absent from the areas where Necl-2 localizes (Figure 2). Therefore, Necl-2 is likely to homophilically trans-interact at these areas lacking nectins. The mechanism of segregation of Necl-2 from nectin-3 at the plasma membrane is currently unknown.

Human Necl-5 was originally isolated as the poliovirus receptor (Mendelsohn et al., 1989; Koike et al., 1990). Rodent Necl-5 was identified as the product of a gene overexpressed in rat and mouse colon carcinoma (Chadeneau et al., 1994, 1996). Although Necl-5 is expressed at a low level in many cells, its expression level is upregulated in many carcinomas (Chadeneau et al., 1994, 1996; Masson et al., 2001). A physiological role of Necl-5 remained unknown for a long time, but it has recently been shown that Necl-5 functions as a CAM (Mueller and Wimmer, 2003; Ikeda et al., 2003). Necl-5 has no homophilic cell-cell adhesion activity but Ca²⁺-independent heterophilic cell-cell adhesion activity selectively with nectin-3 (Figure 1C). Necl-5 co-localizes with integrin αvβ3 at the leading edges of migrating cells and enhances platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-induced cell motility in an integrin-dependent manner (Mueller and Wimmer, 2003; Ikeda et al., 2004). Necl-5 enhances the growth factor-induced, integrin-dependent activation of Cdc42 and Rac. In addition, Necl-5 enhances the PDGF-induced cell proliferation by shortening the period of the G₀/G₁ phase of the cell cycle (Kakunaga et al., 2004). Necl-5 enhances the PDGF-induced activation of the Ras-Raf-MAP kinase/ERK-activating kinase-ERK pathway, and consequently up-regulates cyclins D2 and E and down-regulates p27<sup>Kip1</sup>. Because Necl-5 localizes with integrins at leading edges of migrating cells, Necl-5 may first recognize nectin-3, which may be diffusely distributed along the free surface of the plasma membrane, and heterophilically trans-interact with nectin-3, causing formation of the Necl-5- and nectin-3-based micro-clusters (Takai et al., 2003a; Ikeda et al., 2004; Sato et al., 2004). These micro-clusters are formed more rapidly than the formation of the micro-clusters of nectins by themselves, but may be transient because the affinity of nectin-3 for Necl-5 is far less than that for nectin-1, and the Necl-5 molecule trans-interacting with nectin-3 may be replaced by nectin-1, resulting in the hetero-trans-interactions of nectin-3 with nectin-1. The nectin-3 molecule recruited by its hetero-trans-interactions with Necl-5 or the nectin-1 molecule recruited by its hetero-trans-interactions with nectin-3 recruits E-cadherin to the cell-cell adhesion sites of both sides of protrusions of migrating cells, resulting in the formation of AJs.

### Conclusions and perspectives

We have described here the activities and functions of nectins. Nectins are involved in many types of cell-cell junctions/contacts in cooperation with, or independently of, cadherins. In addition, nectins transduce signals through Cdc42 and Rac, which reorganize the actin

cytoskeleton, regulate the formation of AJs and TJs, and strengthen cell-cell adhesion. Nectins furthermore play a role in cell polarization by activation of Cdc42 and direct binding to Par-3. On the other hand, nectins heterophilically trans-interact with Necls and assist or modify their functions. Thus, nectins play important roles in cell adhesion, migration, and polarization. The ability of nectins to trans-interact with Necls suggests that nectins may be furthermore involved in other important physiological functions. For instance, a cross talk between cell-cell junctions and cell-matrix junctions has been known for a long time, but the mechanism remains unknown. Nectin-3 may be involved in this cross talk in cooperation with Nec1-5. Contact inhibition of cell movement and proliferation has also been known for a long time, but the mechanism remained unknown too. The hetero-trans-interactions of nectin-3 with Nec1-5 may be involved in this contact inhibition. Further studies are necessary to deepen our understanding of the roles that nectins play in a variety of physiological processes.
