# Endocrine regulation of ageing

**Steven J. Russell and C. Ronald Kahn**

**Abstract** | Over the past 15 years it has become clear that mutations in genes that regulate endocrine signalling pathways can prolong lifespan. Lifespan can be increased by altered endocrine signalling in a group of cells or a single tissue, which indicates that crosstalk between tissues functions to coordinate ageing of the organism. These endocrine pathways might serve as targets for the manipulation of the ageing process and prevention of age-related diseases.

**World Death Rate Holding Steady at 100 Percent**  
— The Onion, Headline, January 22, 1997

Although death remains inevitable, improvements in food production, sanitation and medicine have produced large gains in average human lifespan since the mid-1800s¹. Before the 1950s, these gains were largely due to reduced mortality at young ages, but gains in average lifespan since that time have been achieved primarily through the reduction of mortality at older ages². Unfortunately, some of the additional years of life are lived in poor health. Ideally, interventions that target the ageing process itself could be found, thereby increasing healthy lifespan.

An intervention that can delay ageing in many animal models is calorie or food restriction. Food restriction without malnutrition prolongs the lifespan of animal species from single-cell organisms to mammals³. In addition to promoting longevity, food restriction delays or prevents age-related diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer and renal failure, increases the stress resistance of organs such as the heart and brain, and prolongs the period of healthy functioning⁴⁻⁸. Short-term food restriction in humans leads to alterations in biomarkers that are associated with longevity in animals⁹. A consistent phenotype of food-restricted animals is decreased insulin levels with normal blood glucose levels³.

Findings in several model organisms suggest that the relationship between decreased insulin levels and longevity might not be an epiphenomenon, but rather a clue to an important role for hormones in the regulation of ageing. Endocrine signalling in lower species was first linked to lifespan when it was shown that mutations in *daf-2*, a homologue of the mammalian insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF1) receptors¹⁰, dramatically lengthen the lifespan of *Caenorhabditis elegans*¹¹. An extensive body of work has shown that mutations in many genes in the insulin/IGF1 signalling pathway can prolong the lifespan of *C. elegans* and *Drosophila melanogaster*¹². In mammals, the relationship between insulin/IGF1 signalling and longevity is more complex owing to the functional differentiation of IGF1 and insulin, and because of the crucial role for insulin in the regulation of glucose homeostasis. Nonetheless, decreases in both IGF1 and insulin signalling prolong lifespan in mice, which demonstrates that these pathways of lifespan regulation have been conserved through evolution¹³.

One intriguing aspect of some longevity pathways is that they function cell non-autonomously; that is, mutations in one cell type can alter the phenotype of the whole organism. Adipose tissue (the function of which is carried out by the intestine in worms) and neuronal cells appear to have a special role in cell non-autonomous lifespan regulation by the insulin/IGF1 pathway in both flies and worms¹⁴⁻¹⁷. Lifespan can also be regulated cell non-autonomously in mammals because impaired insulin signalling in the adipose tissue of mice increases lifespan¹⁸. These observations imply the existence of endocrine signals that function to coordinate ageing between cells and tissues.

In addition to insulin and IGF1, one potential mediator of crosstalk between tissues in mammals is KLOTHO, a transmembrane protein with homology to β-glycosidases. Although KLOTHO lacks a clear antecedent in lower metazoans¹⁹, recent work has shown that Klotho overexpression in a subset of tissues is sufficient to prolong lifespan²⁰. A fragment of the KLOTHO protein circulates in the blood, which suggests that it might act as a hormone.

Work in *C. elegans* and *D. melanogaster* has shown that alterations in lipophilic hormone pathways, which are important in sexual reproduction and/or development, also regulate ageing²¹⁻²⁴. Decreased signalling through these pathways is associated with increased lifespan in most cases. Although the relevant hormones in

**The insulin/IGF1 pathway**

Decreased signalling through the insulin/IGF1 pathway can increase the lifespan of worms by up to 250%²⁶ and that of flies by up to 85%²². The insulin/IGF1 signalling pathway is highly conserved between worms, flies and mammals. One of the intermediates in the insulin/IGF1 signalling cascade is the activation of the serine/threonine kinase AKT/protein kinase B (PKB) and the serum/glucocorticoid-regulated kinase (SGK)²⁷(BOX 1).

From the standpoint of ageing, the most important AKT/PKB and SGK substrates appear to be the class O of forkhead box transcription factors (FoxOs)²⁸,²⁹. AKT/PKB- and SGK-mediated phosphorylation of FoxOs (DAF-16 in worms and FOXO in flies) results in FoxO sequestration in the cytoplasm. Mutations that decrease signalling though the insulin/IGF1 signalling pathway reduce the phosphorylation of FoxOs, resulting in their nuclear translocation³⁰,³¹. In the nucleus, FoxOs modulate the expression of genes that increase lifespan³²⁻³⁴. Lifespan extension by signalling through the insulin/IGF1 pathway requires *daf-16* in worms¹¹. Likewise, overexpression of FOXO is sufficient to increase lifespan in flies¹⁴. Although moderately decreased signalling through the insulin/IGF1 pathway prolongs lifespan in worms, severe reductions in insulin/IGF1 signalling during development can result in the formation of distinctive dauer larvae and failure to complete normal development (BOX 2).

**Box 1 | Insulin/IGF1 signalling pathways in the regulation of ageing**

Parallel pathways in *Caenorhabditis elegans*, *Drosophila melanogaster* and *Mus musculus* regulate the activity of the class O forkhead box transcription factors (DAF-16, FOXO and FOXO1, respectively) through a conserved signalling pathway. Worms and flies both have a single orthologue of the mammalian insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF1) receptor tyrosine kinases called DAF-2 and insulin receptor (InR), respectively¹⁰,²². On binding of one of a family of insulin-like ligands¹²⁴, the tyrosine kinase activities of DAF-2 and InR are activated and phosphorylate phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). In flies, an InR substrate (CHICO), which is analogous to the mammalian insulin receptor (IR) substrate (IRS) proteins, facilitates the InR–PI3K interaction²²,¹²⁵,¹²⁶. The phosphorylated PI3K synthesizes phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P₃) and PtdIns(3,4)P₂ (REF. 127), which in turn activate 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1). PDK1 then phosphorylates and activates AKT/protein kinase B (PKB) and the serum/glucocorticoid-regulated kinase (SGK)²⁷. These kinases target FoxOs and block their transcriptional activity. Inhibition of the insulin/IGF1 pathways allows FoxOs to positively regulate the expression of anti-ageing genes and negatively regulate the expression of pro-ageing genes³²⁻³⁴. DAF-16 positively regulates the following, and other, putative longevity genes: antioxidants (superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione S-transferase and metallothionein), chaperones (heat-shock protein-16 (HSP16) and HSP20), metabolic genes (apolipoproteins, glyoxylate cycle and cytochrome P450s), 17β-oestradiol dehydrogenases, alcohol and short-chain dehydrogenases, UDP-glucuronosyltransferases, pantothenate kinase, acyl-CoA synthetase and amino-acid metabolism genes. DAF-16 negatively regulates the following, and other, putative pro-ageing genes: vitellogenin (yolk protein) and guanylate cyclases.

**Cell non-autonomous regulation of lifespan.** Cell non-autonomous regulation of ageing in the *daf-2* pathway was first demonstrated using mosaic analysis. Worms that carry a *daf-2* mutation in a subset of cells (always including at least a few neurons) have a prolonged lifespan³⁵. Restoration of wild-type *daf-2* to specific subsets of neurons in long-lived *daf-2* mutants reverses the longevity, which demonstrates that insulin signalling in neurons is crucial for the regulation of lifespan¹⁵ (FIG. 1). By contrast, expression of *daf-16* in the intestine (the main site of fat storage) of short-lived *daf-2*; *daf-16* double-null mutants substantially increases lifespan¹⁶. These findings imply the existence of endocrine longevity signals from the neurons and the intestine to other tissues of the worm. The identities of these signals remain unknown, but because the experiments were carried out in *daf-2* mutants, they must be independent of the insulin receptor.

In worms that possess the wild-type insulin receptor, *daf-16* overexpression in intestinal cells upregulates the expression of *daf-16*-dependent genes in other tissues. The expression of several insulin-like peptides is regulated by *daf-2* and *daf-16* (REF. 34), so a feed-forward loop might exist in which DAF-16 decreases the expression of *daf-2*, thereby derepressing the transcriptional activity of DAF-16 in other tissues (FIG. 1).

In flies, transgenic overexpression of FOXO in the fat body is sufficient to prolong lifespan¹⁴,¹⁷,³⁶ (FIG. 2). Tissue-specific FOXO overexpression in the cerebral fat body also increases the levels of FOXO in the nuclei of peripheral fat-body cells¹⁴. This suggests that endocrine signals that are regulated by FOXO in the

Box 2 | Dauer formation mutants in the study of ageing

The *daf* (dauer formation) genes of *Caenorhabditis elegans* were initially identified as mediators of a developmental switch between the continued development of larvae to adults under favourable conditions and an alternative larval form called dauer ('enduring') under conditions of food deprivation or crowding<sup>128</sup>. The dauer form is highly stress resistant and very long-lived. Worms can remain in the dauer form for months, and time spent as a dauer does not reduce the post-dauer lifespan<sup>129</sup>. In contrast to higher animals that are exposed to starvation or dietary restriction, worms in dauer accumulate fat in intestinal cells. Strong mutations in *daf* genes lead to dauer formation even under favourable conditions, whereas some weak mutations in *daf-2* prolong lifespan without significantly altering development<sup>11</sup>. Using temperature-sensitive alleles, it has been shown that decreasing *daf-2* function in adulthood, after the dauer decision has been made, is also sufficient to increase lifespan<sup>130</sup>. Therefore, it appears that inhibition of the insulin/insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF1) signalling pathway may promote longevity by activating some of the same mechanisms that are responsible for the longevity of dauer larvae.

altered<sup>17,36</sup>. Despite the inconsistencies, the findings of both groups imply the existence of hormonal signals from the fat body to other tissues that regulate lifespan<sup>14,17</sup>. Interestingly, expression of FOXO in neurons does not prolong lifespan<sup>14</sup>.

A role for IGF1 in the control of mammalian ageing. In mammals, distinct insulin and IGF1 receptors are homologous to the single insulin/IGF1 receptor that is present in worms and flies. The phenotypes of mice with genetic lesions in the growth hormone (GH)–IGF1 axis are consistent with a role for IGF1 in the control of mammalian ageing<sup>13</sup> (FIG. 3). The first observation of longevity in animals with altered IGF1 signalling was reported in the Ames dwarf mouse, which carries a mutation in PROP1, a transcription factor that is required for normal pituitary development. Ames dwarf mice lack GH, have low levels of circulating IGF1 and have longer mean lifespans than wild-type controls<sup>37</sup>. However, these animals also lack prolactin and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)<sup>37</sup>. Snell dwarf mice, which carry a mutation in PIT1, another transcription factor required for pituitary development, have a similar phenotype to the Ames dwarf mice and are long-lived even when their hypothyroidism is treated with thyroid hormone<sup>38,39</sup>. Mice that have had the GH-receptor/binding protein (GHR/BP) or the GH-releasing hormone receptor deleted also have low GH and IGF1 levels and are long-lived<sup>40-43</sup>.

The evidence that most specifically implicates IGF1 signalling in lifespan regulation comes from IGF1-receptor (*Igf1r*)-mutant mice. Although homozygous *Igf1r*<sup>-/-</sup> mice die shortly after birth, female *Igf1r*<sup>+/-</sup> mice are long-lived<sup>44</sup>. The less dramatic and sex-specific longevity phenotype of *Igf1r*<sup>+/-</sup> as compared with more significantly dwarfed strains could be due to a more modest reduction in IGF1 signalling<sup>41,42,45,46</sup>. In addition, stocks derived from wild mice have lower IGF1 levels than mixed-background laboratory stocks, grow more slowly and live longer<sup>47</sup>, which suggests that IGF1 levels might function to regulate lifespan even in normal animals. Taken together, these findings suggest that IGF1 is an important regulator of longevity; however, it is unclear whether the IGF1 receptor can regulate lifespan cell non-autonomously in mammals.

Control of lifespan by insulin in mammals

The relationship between insulin signalling and ageing is more complicated in mammals than in lower metazoans. Owing to the key role of insulin in the regulation of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism in mammals, dramatic reductions in insulin signalling lead to metabolic disarray and shortened lifespan. Insulin-receptor knockout mice die in early neonatal life of diabetic ketoacidosis<sup>48</sup>, and insulin deficiency in human type-1 diabetes is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. In contrast to findings in *C. elegans* and *D. melanogaster*, insulin resistance is a predictor of age-related diseases in otherwise healthy, non-obese humans<sup>49</sup>. Caloric restriction in mammals is associated with decreased insulin levels and normal or low glucose levels, which suggests a positive correlation between insulin sensitivity and longevity<sup>3</sup>.

Figure 1 | Cell non-autonomous regulation of lifespan by insulin/insulin-like growth factor-1 signalling in worms. Insulin released from neurons activates DAF-2 (abnormal dauer formation-2), which leads to the inhibition of DAF-16 activity. Reducing the activity of DAF-2 relieves the repression of DAF-16, thereby promoting an anti-ageing pattern of gene expression. DAF-16 in the intestine can feed back to reduce insulin release by neurons, presumably through a humoral factor, thereby leading indirectly to the activation of DAF-16 in other tissues. Restoration of DAF-2 to neurons of a *daf-2*-knockout animal shortens the lifespan, which suggests that a humoral-factor-independent DAF-2 in cells other than neurons can promote longevity. The *daf-16* locus was intact in these experiments, so the signal pathway could include DAF-16 either in the neuron, in the target cell or both. Expression of the gene or activation of DAF-16 in the intestine can prolong lifespan even in *daf-2*; *daf-16*-knockout animals, which indicates the existence of another humoral factor that is independent of both *daf-2* and *daf-16* in target cells. The identity of the humoral factor (or factors) is not known. It is possible that a single factor might have more than one of these activities. SIR-2.1, sirtuin-2.1.

Figure 2 | Cell non-autonomous regulation of lifespan by insulin/IGF1 signalling in flies. Overexpression or activation of the class O forkhead box transcription factor FOXO localized to the fat body results in longevity. Diminished insulin signalling, overexpression of FOXO or expression of a constitutively active FOXO mutant all result in nuclear localization of FOXO in fat-body cells. Once in the nucleus and transcriptionally active, FOXO might stimulate the production of humoral factors in the fat body that promote an anti-ageing pattern of gene expression in other tissues. Alternatively, FOXO might inhibit the production of humoral factors that repress an anti-ageing pattern of gene expression in target tissues. InR, insulin receptor.

Diabetic ketoacidosis  
Metabolic derangement in the absence of adequate insulin signalling, characterized by marked hyperglycaemia and the excess production of organic acids that are derived from lipolysis.

Insulin resistance  
A state characterized by a requirement for elevated levels of insulin to maintain normoglycaemia. Insulin resistance is the earliest defect in the progressive pathogenesis of type-2 diabetes mellitus and is present in individuals who are obese or who have the metabolic syndrome.

Leptin  
A peptide hormone produced by adipocytes that negatively regulates food intake and positively regulates metabolic rate. Both leptin deficiency and leptin resistance are associated with obesity. Leptin levels are low in mammals on caloric restriction.

Adiponectin  
A peptide hormone that is produced by adipocytes in an amount that is inversely proportional to fat mass. Increased adiponectin levels are associated with increased insulin sensitivity.

In addition to demonstrating that insulin signalling can regulate ageing in mammals, the FIRKO mouse is unique in demonstrating cell non-autonomous control of ageing in mammals at the level of a hormone receptor. This finding suggests that humoral signals are produced in fat tissue and regulate ageing in other tissues (FIG. 3). Although the levels of insulin are lower, the IGF1 levels are not different between FIRKO and control animals, which raises the question of what might mediate this phenotype. The ageing phenotype could be related to the adipokine leptin<sup>52</sup>. Leptin levels are generally proportional to fat mass, but leptin levels in FIRKO mice are similar to controls despite their lower adipose mass. In F2 hybrids between long-lived wild-derived and shorter-lived mixed-background laboratory mice, lifespan correlates positively with leptin levels but negatively with body weight<sup>47</sup>. The levels of another adipokine, adiponectin, increase in calorie-restricted rodents and humans<sup>53,54</sup>. Adiponectin levels are also increased in FIRKO mice, which is expected given the smaller fat mass in these animals<sup>51</sup>. Genes that are involved in the synthesis or metabolism of steroid hormones are expressed in mammalian fat<sup>55</sup>, and steroid hormones have been shown to modulate lifespan in worms (see below)<sup>34,56</sup>, which raises the interesting possibility that insulin signalling might affect lifespan by altering steroid-hormone metabolism in fat.

Since the FIRKO mouse was initially characterized, it has become clear that the fatty-acid-binding protein (aP2) gene promoter that was used to drive expression of Cre recombinase in fat is not completely adipocyte-specific; aP2-driven Cre expression has been reported in parts of the vertebrae, cartilage<sup>57</sup> and activated macrophages<sup>58</sup>. Macrophages express the insulin receptor, and insulin signalling affects macrophage function<sup>59,60</sup>. Macrophages accumulate in adipose tissue in obesity and are an important source of inflammatory mediators that are implicated in insulin resistance<sup>61</sup>. Thus, it is possible that deletion of the insulin-receptor gene from one of these cell types or tissues might alter insulin sensitivity and contribute to the phenotype of the FIRKO mouse<sup>44,44,62–64</sup>.

FOXO proteins and insulin/IGF1 signalling. In parallel with the increased complexity of the insulin/IGF1 pathway in mammals, there are four FoxO proteins (FOXO1, FOXO3, FOXO4 and FOXO6) that are orthologous to DAF-16 and FOXO. They are all regulated by AKT/PKB phosphorylation and therefore by insulin signalling. FOXO1 is most closely related to DAF-16 and FOXO, and is the most extensively studied<sup>65</sup>. The metabolic effects of FOXO1 vary with the tissue, but they generally antagonize the actions of insulin<sup>66–71</sup> (TABLE 1). FOXO1 activity itself is negatively regulated by insulin through AKT/PKB phosphorylation, which causes it to translocate to the cytoplasm from the nucleus. Whether altered FOXO1 levels or activity can affect lifespan in mammals has not been reported.

The FIRKO mouse. Fat-specific insulin-receptor knockout (FIRKO) mice have a dramatically different phenotype from other tissue-specific insulin-receptor deletion strains. Although adipocytes from FIRKO animals are resistant to the effects of insulin, the animals are lean and are protected from systemic insulin resistance and diabetes, both on high-fat diets and during normal ageing<sup>51</sup> (FIG. 3). FIRKO mice are protected from age-associated obesity despite a food intake that is equivalent on a per-mouse basis and is higher on a weight-adjusted basis. In addition to these beneficial metabolic changes, FIRKO mice have an increase in median (18%) and maximum (14%) lifespan compared with littermate controls<sup>18</sup>. Therefore, in this model of tissue-specific insulin resistance, reduction in fat mass and insulin levels are associated with increased lifespan without caloric restriction.

Sirtuins and insulin/IGF1 signalling. In addition to regulation by the insulin/IGF1 signalling pathway through AKT/PKB-mediated phosphorylation, the activities of DAF-16, FOXO and FOXO1 are modulated by acetylation.

Figure 3 | Regulation of lifespan by insulin/IGF1 signalling in mice. Inhibition of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF1) signalling (by IGF1 receptor (IGF1R) haploinsufficiency or a reduction in IGF1 levels) or deletion of the insulin receptor (IR) in fat tissue prolongs lifespan. It is speculated that these effects might occur by disinhibition of the class O forkhead box transcription factor FOXO1, in analogy to the system in worms and flies. In the case of IR deletion in fat tissue (fat-specific insulin-receptor knockout (FIRKO)), there must be humoral factors that modulate the rate of ageing in other tissues. FOXO1 might activate the production of humoral factors in fat that promote an anti-ageing pattern of gene expression in other tissues. Alternatively, FOXO1 might inhibit the production of humoral factors that repress an anti-ageing pattern of gene expression in other tissues. The sirtuin SIRT1 might also have a role in the activation of FOXO1, and SIRT2 acts to block the inhibitory effects of insulin signalling on FOXO1 in adipocytes. Overexpression of Klotho inhibits both insulin and IGF1 signalling and prolongs lifespan. Whether KLOTHO inhibits ageing directly in all target tissues or acts indirectly through a cell non-autonomous mechanism (for example, by inhibiting insulin signalling in fat tissue) is not known.

Sirtuins are protein deacetylases that were first identified in yeast, in which the overexpression of the founding member of the class, Sir2, prolongs lifespan. Overexpression of the Sir2 homologues — SIR-2.1 in worms and SIR2 in flies — also prolongs the lifespan of these organisms [72,73]. The effect of SIR-2.1 overexpression in worms requires DAF-16, but SIR-2.1 is not required for lifespan extension by the insulin/IGF1 signalling pathway [74]. Therefore, it appears that signals from the insulin/IGF1 signalling pathway and from SIR-2.1 are integrated at the level of DAF-16 in worms.

In mammals, there are seven sirtuins (SIRT1–7), with SIRT1 being the closest homologue of Sir2. SIRT1 has a complex relationship with insulin signalling and FOXO1 in different tissues. Whole-body deletion of *Sirt1* in mice leads to perinatal lethality, but surviving animals overexpress IGF-binding protein-1 (*Igfbp1*), which results in lower levels of free IGF1 and a dwarf phenotype [75,76]. The metabolic effects of SIRT1 vary with the tissue but, like those of FOXO1, appear to oppose the actions of insulin in liver and adipose tissue [77,78] (TABLE 1). SIRT2 has been shown to deacetylate FOXO1 and inhibit insulin-stimulated FOXO1 phosphorylation in adipocytes [79] (FIG. 3). In pancreatic β-cells, SIRT1 enhances glucose-stimulated insulin secretion [80,81]. SIRT1 activity is modulated by the NAD⁺/NADH ratio and/or nicotinamide concentration, and these might change in different ways in different tissues [72,73]. Therefore, tissue-specific alterations in SIRT1 activity might occur in response to changing metabolic conditions.

The effects of *Sirt1* overexpression on lifespan have not been reported. However, activators of *Sirt1*, such as resveratrol, increase lifespan in yeast, worms and flies [82,83]. Treatment of mice on a high-fat diet with resveratrol has been shown to limit the accumulation of fat without reducing food intake [84]. Resveratrol-treated wild-type mice also have increased exercise tolerance and an increase in resting-energy expenditure. This is associated with an increase in oxidative phosphorylation and the expression of genes of the electron-transport chain in the muscle, decreased acetylation of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor coactivator-1α (PGC1α), and increased expression of *Pgc1α*. Insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance at the whole-body level are also significantly increased [84]. Treatment with resveratrol for 6 months prevented the development of fatty liver and reduced the death rate of high-fat-diet mice to the level of chow-fed controls [85], but it is not clear whether all of the effects of resveratrol feeding are mediated through SIRT1. Further study is needed to define the relationships between these phenotypes and insulin/IGF1 signalling.

**KLOTHO, an anti-ageing hormone?**

The *Klotho* gene was identified serendipitously through a hypomorphic allele that results in severe early degenerative changes and short lifespan [19]. The homozygous mutant animals develop normally until 3 weeks of age, then exhibit severe growth retardation, osteoporosis, ectopic calcification, arteriosclerosis, emphysema and atrophy of the skin, thymus, testes and ovaries, and die at an average age of 61 days.

*Klotho* encodes a protein with a single transmembrane domain and an extracellular domain that contains two repeats (KL1 and KL2), both of which have up to 40% homology to β-glycosidase family-1. *Klotho* is expressed predominantly in the choroid plexus of the brain and the distal convoluted tubule of the kidney [19,86].

An alternatively spliced transcript that lacks the transmembrane domain also exists<sup>87</sup>. The extracellular domain of KLOTHO is detectable in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid of mice and humans, which suggests that KLOTHO could function as a hormone<sup>20,88</sup>. Transgenic overexpression of *Klotho* in the brain and testes is sufficient for rescue of the growth defect and accelerated ageing phenotypes of *Klotho*-deficient mice, further supporting the hypothesis that KLOTHO can function as a humoral factor<sup>19,20</sup>. The possibility that KLOTHO acts enzymatically on another circulating factor cannot be eliminated.

Mice that overexpress *Klotho* live longer than congenic controls (31% longer in males and 19% longer in females), which demonstrates that KLOTHO has an anti-ageing effect<sup>20</sup>. In contrast to findings in food-restricted animals and the FIRKO mouse, *Klotho*-transgenic mice are insulin resistant, with elevated insulin levels in the setting of normal blood glucose. Conversely, male *Klotho*-deficient mice are hypoglycaemic, hypoinsulinaemic and more sensitive to the hypoglycaemic effects of insulin and IGF1 than wild-type controls. Female *Klotho*-deficient mice are IGF1-deficient<sup>89,90</sup>. At a physiological and molecular level, acute intraperitoneal administration of the extracellular domain of KLOTHO causes insulin resistance in both male and female mice (FIG. 3). This effect is not due to competition with insulin for binding to its receptor. However, acute administration of KLOTHO does inhibit autophosphorylation of the insulin and IGF1 receptors as well as downstream signalling events such as phosphorylation of insulin-receptor substrate-1 (IRS1) and IRS2 (REF. 20). Treatment with KLOTHO protein also blocks autophosphorylation of IGF1 receptors in response to IGF1 stimulation and promotes dephosphorylation of previously activated insulin and IGF1 receptors. Consistent with the hypothesis that KLOTHO prolongs lifespan at least in part by inhibiting insulin/IGF1 signalling, heterozygous deletion of IRS1 partially rescued the reduced lifespan of male *Klotho*-deficient animals and prevented the morphological changes that were reminiscent of ageing<sup>20</sup>.

The effects of KLOTHO on FGF23 signalling. Levels of calcium and phosphate are elevated in *Klotho*-deficient mice, demonstrating that this protein has a role in calcium and phosphate homeostasis<sup>19,91</sup>. The altered calcium and phosphate levels are due to elevated 1,25-(OH)<sub>2</sub>-vitamin-D levels, which result from increased expression of the 1α-hydroxylase gene<sup>91</sup>. Normalization of 1,25-(OH)<sub>2</sub>-vitamin-D with a vitamin-D-deficient diet partially rescued some of the *Klotho*-deficient phenotypes, including slow growth, ectopic calcification and early death<sup>92</sup>. This suggests that the putatively pro-ageing effects of *Klotho* deficiency are not associated with ageing, but rather that the pathology is related to altered vitamin D metabolism.

Insights into the role of KLOTHO in calcium metabolism came from the observation that fibroblast growth factor-23 (*Fgf23*)-knockout mice share many features with the *Klotho*-deficient mouse, including hypercalcaemia, hyperphosphataemia, ectopic calcification, hypoglycaemia, infertility and very short lifespan<sup>93</sup>. FGF23 is a circulating factor that is produced in the bone and inhibits phosphate transport in renal proximal tubular cells. FGF23 deficiency results in phosphate retention and hyperphosphataemia<sup>93</sup>, constitutively elevated expression of 1α-hydroxylase, elevated 1,25-(OH)<sub>2</sub>-vitamin-D levels and hypercalcaemia<sup>93</sup>. Multiple FGF23 receptor isoforms can be immunoprecipitated with KLOTHO from tissue-culture cells, and KLOTHO potentiates the interaction between FGF23 and FGF receptors, enhancing the ability of FGF23 to activate downstream signalling pathways<sup>94</sup>.

Defective FGF23 signalling could explain many phenotypes of the *Klotho*-deficient mouse. However, how this signalling pathway contributes to the increased lifespan of mice that overexpress *Klotho* is still unclear. *Fgf23*-knockout mice are hypoglycaemic relative to littermates, so it is possible that FGF23 signalling antagonizes the action of insulin and/or IGF1. FGF23 has been shown to activate the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) ERK and p38 in kidney cells<sup>95</sup>. ERK can phosphorylate IRS1 on serine residues, thereby negatively regulating IRS1 signalling<sup>96</sup>. Many tissues express the FGF-receptor

subtypes that interact with the KLOTHO–FGF23 complex⁹⁷. Therefore, it is possible that KLOTHO, acting together with FGF23, might prolong lifespan by activating ERK and inhibiting insulin/IGF1 signalling at the level of the IRS proteins. This would be consistent with the finding that IRS1 deletion can partially suppress the short lifespan phenotype of Klotho-deficient mice²⁰.

**Enzymatic activity of KLOTHO.** In addition to its effects on insulin, IGF1 and FGF23 signalling, KLOTHO may also have enzymatic activity. KLOTHO has two repeats of a domain with homology to glycosidase family-1 enzymes, and a fusion protein that contains the KLOTHO extracellular domain has β-glucuronidase activity on a model fluorescent substrate⁸⁶. KLOTHO can hydrolyse steroid glucuronides (steroid-GlcUs), including oestradiol-3GlcU, oestrone-3GlcU and oestriol-3GlcU. Thus, some of the effects of KLOTHO could occur through processing of inactive steroid glucuronides to active steroid hormones. Steroid hormones could have a role in the regulation of ageing in mammals (see below), so the glucuronidase activity might be relevant to the longevity phenotype of Klotho-transgenic mice. KLOTHO can increase the membrane concentration of the renal epithelial cell calcium channel TRPV5 by deglycosylation of the TRPV5 protein on the cell, resulting in calcium influx⁹⁸. Deglycosylation activity might also affect receptors that are relevant to ageing, such as the IGF1 receptor and insulin receptor.

A human homologue with 86% identity to KLOTHO has been identified¹⁹, and polymorphisms that result in amino-acid substitutions in human KLOTHO are associated with longevity in diverse human populations⁹⁹. This appears to be due, at least in part, to alterations in cardiovascular risk factors¹⁰⁰.

**Lipophilic signalling and lifespan**

In addition to identifying peptide-hormone-receptor signalling as a determinant of lifespan, studies in *C. elegans* and *D. melanogaster* have also identified a role for lipophilic hormones in regulating ageing. In some cases, these lipophilic signals are downstream of insulin/IGF1 signalling, but in others they are regulated by the reproductive pathway.

$daf$-2 mutants, which suggests that the reproductive pathway functions in parallel to the insulin/IGF1 signalling pathway for lifespan regulation²⁶.

Two distinct classes of steroid modulators of lifespan in the reproductive pathway have been identified — bile-acid-like cholestenoic acids and pregnenolone²⁵,¹⁰⁶,¹⁰⁷. The bile-acid-like steroids (also known as dafachronic acids or DCAs) 3-keto-4-cholestenoic acid and 3-keto-(5α)-cholestenoic acid were identified as high-affinity ligands for DAF-12 (REF. 107). Both compounds are present in normal worms but absent in $daf$-9 worms. DCAs increase the lifespan of germline-ablated $daf$-9 and $daf$-36 mutants, but have no effect on wild-type or $daf$-12 mutants. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that DCAs function through DAF-12 to mediate the lifespan effect of the reproductive pathways¹⁰⁸ (FIG. 4).

Pregnenolone and several other steroids that are present in mammals have also been identified as modulators of lifespan²⁵. Pregnenolone increases the longevity of germline-deficient $daf$-9 worms, but does not rescue $daf$-12 germline-ablated mutants. Furthermore, pregnenolone increases the lifespan of a $daf$-9 strain with intact germlines and increases the lifespans of wild-type worms by 15–20%²⁵. Thus, it appears that both DCAs and pregnenolone (or its metabolites) are DAF-12 ligands, but that they either bind to separate sites or they recruit different co-activators or co-repressors. This is consistent with the finding that $daf$-12 mutants can have either shorter or longer lifespans depending on the specific mutations¹⁰⁹,¹¹⁰.

**Steroid hormones regulate lifespan in D. melanogaster.** Similar to worms, lipophilic signals, including steroid hormones, also regulate lifespan in flies (FIG. 4b). Flies with mutations in the insulin receptor are long-lived and have a defect in the production of the sesquiterpenoid JH²²,¹¹¹,¹¹². JH is produced in the corpora allata and is downregulated during reproductive diapause. Treatment of the long-lived mutant-insulin-receptor flies with JH reduces their lifespan²², which suggests that decreased insulin-like signalling increases lifespan by reducing JH production. Likewise, synthesis of the steroid hormone ecdysone in the fly ovary is impaired in insulin-receptor mutants²²,¹¹³, and flies with heterozygous mutations in the ecdysone receptor have longer lifespans²¹. The ecdysone receptor is a nuclear hormone receptor that heterodimerizes with ultraspiracle, another nuclear hormone receptor and a candidate for the JH receptor¹¹⁴,¹¹⁵. Similar decreases in JH and ecdysone have been reported for long-lived flies with mutations in CHICO, a homologue of mammalian IRS proteins¹¹¹ (BOX 1), but this conclusion is controversial¹¹⁶. Therefore, ecdysone and JH appear to function downstream of insulin/IGF1 signalling to regulate lifespan in the fly, possibly by modulating the transcriptional activity of nuclear hormone receptors.

**Regulation of longevity by steroid hormones in mammals.** The finding that pregnenolone is sufficient to increase lifespan in worms is intriguing, but whether pregnenolone has any relevance for mammalian ageing is unknown (FIG. 5). Pregnenolone has generally been

**Corpora allata**

**Diapause**
A state of decreased metabolic activity during which reproduction is suspended to await improved conditions.

**Germline ablation increases lifespan in C. elegans.** In worms, ablation of the germline, either by laser microsurgery or with a mutation that blocks germline development, prolongs lifespan²⁴. It has been proposed that the proliferating germline cells are the source of the pro-ageing effect¹⁰¹. The increase in lifespan associated with germline ablation is dependent on DAF-9 (a homologue of cytochrome P450 (REFS102–104)), DAF-36 (a Rieske-like oxygenase¹⁰⁵), DAF-12 (an orphan nuclear hormone receptor²³) and DAF-16. These data suggested a pathway in which a steroid hormone, which is synthesized from cholesterol in a process that requires DAF-9 and DAF-36, binds to DAF-12 and activates DAF-16 to prolong lifespan (FIG. 4a). The production of this putative steroid is predicted to be suppressed by proliferating germ cells. Germline ablation lengthens the already long lives of

Figure 4 | Regulation of lifespan by lipophilic signals in worms and flies.  
a | Regulation of lifespan by steroid hormones in the reproductive pathway of Caenorhabditis elegans. Dafachronic acids (DCAs) and pregnenolone are produced from cholesterol by the action of DAF-9 (abnormal dauer formation-9), DAF-36 and other enzymes. The synthetic steps appear to be distributed among several tissues because the enzymes that are required are not all present in the same cell types. A humoral factor that is produced by the proliferating germ cells of the gonad is thought to inhibit the production of these hormones. Increased levels of DCA and pregnenolone (or a metabolite) circulate in the body fluids and activate DAF-12 (a nuclear hormone receptor), which leads to the activation of DAF-16 and an anti-ageing pattern of gene expression in target cells. The steroid hormones might work indirectly through the action of DAF-12 and DAF-16 in the intestine or directly on each target tissue to slow ageing.  
b | Regulation of lifespan by lipophilic signals downstream of the insulin/IGF1-like pathway in Drosophila melanogaster. Insulin action in the corpora allata (a neuroendocrine organ attached to the brain) stimulates production of the lipophilic hormone juvenile hormone (JH). Insulin action in the corpora allata or the ovary stimulates production of the steroid hormone ecdysone. Both JH and ecdysone act as pro-ageing hormones. Therefore, reducing insulin levels or inhibiting insulin signalling by mutation of CHICO reduces levels of JH and ecdysone and promotes longevity. InR, insulin receptor.

viewed as an intermediate in steroid-hormone biosynthesis that does not have any direct biological activity. A mammalian receptor that is activated by pregnenolone and called pregnane X receptor (PXR) has been identified, but the pregnenolone concentrations found in human and rodent serum (1–50 nM) are far below the EC₅₀ (half maximal effective concentration) for activation of PXR (~5 μM). Therefore, it has been speculated that the natural ligand of PXR is a different pregnane¹¹⁷, possibly a metabolite of pregnenolone.

FOXO1 can physically interact with PXR and function as a PXR co-activator, and AKT/PKB-mediated FOXO1 phosphorylation inhibits the co-activator function of FOXO1 (REF. 118). Conversely, PXR can function as a co-repressor for FOXO1-mediated transactivation of insulin-responsive gluconeogenic genes in the presence of a high-affinity pregnenolone analogue. These findings provide a possible link between steroid hormones that are implicated in ageing and the insulin and IGF1 pathways in mammalian cells. Last, pregnenolone and its sulphate ester are neurosteroids that promote neuronal survival and reverse age-associated memory deficits in rodents, possibly by modulating several neurotransmitter systems and promoting microtubule assembly¹¹⁹,¹²⁰. These findings indicate that, apart from its role as an intermediary in steroid-hormone synthesis, pregnenolone can also directly affect physiological processes.

density) and negative (for example, increased risk of breast cancer and cardiovascular events) effects, and thus it is difficult to interpret the effects of these hormones on lifespan<sup>123</sup>.

### Conclusions

Genetic alterations, in some cases in only a subset of cells or tissues, can modulate lifespan through endocrine signals. The insulin/IGF1 signalling pathways of worms and flies are the best-studied models of endocrine regulation of lifespan, identifying insulin-like peptides as mediators of longevity in these organisms. The insect hormones JH and ecdysone are regulated by the insulin/IGF1 signalling pathways and function as mediators of longevity in flies. The steroid hormone pregnenolone or its metabolites and the bile-acid-like DCAs have now been added to the list of hormones that are known to regulate lifespan in worms. In mammals, IGF1 is well established as an endocrine regulator of ageing, and insulin appears to have a role in specific tissues to regulate lifespan. KLOTHO might be an anti-ageing hormone that functions by modulating insulin/IGF1 signalling and the activity of FGF23 on its receptors. In addition to these hormonal modulators, cell non-autonomous aspects of several ageing pathways suggest that other endocrine regulators of ageing remain to be identified.

Although the molecular era of ageing research began less than 15 years ago, progress has been good, especially in worms and flies. The time required to perform ageing experiments in mice remains a challenge, but the identification of endocrine regulators of ageing provides many new opportunities to investigate the mechanisms of ageing and age-related diseases. The next few years promise to be exciting as the role of newly discovered pathways is clarified, the interactions between pathways are defined and new endocrine regulators suggested by cell non-autonomous aspects of known pathways are identified.

#### Note added in proof

As this article went to press, a new model of lifespan regulation in mammals by insulin/IGF1 signalling was reported<sup>131</sup>. Brain-specific heterozygous and homozygous knockout of *Irs2* increases lifespan by up to 18% in mice, similar to the increase in lifespan found in FIRKO mice. Systemic heterozygous deletion of *Irs2* results in a similar lifespan extension. Thus, FIRKO and brain-specific *Irs2*-knockout mice are both models of cell non-autonomous regulation of lifespan by the insulin and IGF1 signalling pathways.
