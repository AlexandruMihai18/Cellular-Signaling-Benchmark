### SUMMARY

Fibroblast growth factor homologous factors (FHF) are not growth factors, but instead bind to voltage-gated Na⁺ channels (Naᵥ) and regulate their function. Mutations in *FGF14*, an FHF that is the locus for spinocerebellar ataxia 27 (SCA27), are believed to be pathogenic because of a dominant-negative reduction of Naᵥ currents in cerebellar granule cells. Here, we demonstrate that *FGF14* also regulates members of the presynaptic Caᵥ2 Ca²⁺ channel family. Knockdown of *FGF14* in granule cells reduced Ca²⁺ currents and diminished vesicular recycling, a marker for presynaptic Ca²⁺ influx. As a consequence, excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) at the granule cell to Purkinje cell synapse were markedly diminished. Expression of the SCA27-causing *FGF14* mutant in granule cells exerted a dominant-negative reduction in Ca²⁺ currents, vesicular recycling, and the resultant EPSCs in Purkinje cells. Thus, FHFs are multimodal, regulating several discrete neuronal signaling events. SCA27 most likely results at least in part from dysregulation of Ca²⁺ channel function.

### INTRODUCTION

The four members of the family of fibroblast growth factor homologous factors (FHFs; FGF11–FGF14), a subset of the fibroblast growth factors (FGFs), have received increasing attention for their unanticipated modulation of voltage-gated Na⁺ (Naᵥ) channels and regulation of neuronal excitability. Although FHFs acquired their name because of their homology to FGFs (*Smallwood et al.*, 1996), several defining features set FHFs apart from other FGFs. Most notably, lacking a signal sequence, FHFs are not secreted (*Smallwood et al.*, 1996) and do not appear to be capable of functioning as growth factors (*Olsen et al.*, 2003). The physiologic roles of FHFs remained ill defined until a confluence of experiments identified FHFs as modulators of Naᵥ channels and regulators of neuronal signaling, and genetic data pinpointed *FGF14* as the locus for spinocerebellar ataxia 27 (SCA27).

Focus on FHF regulation of neuronal excitability began when *Fgf14⁻/⁻* mice showed ataxia (*Wang et al.*, 2002), providing a basis for exploring the implications of a linkage analysis that identified a F150S missense mutation in a “b” splice variant of *FGF14* (*FGF14b*¹⁵⁰S; termed *FGF14*¹⁴⁵S in some studies that used numbering based on the alternatively spliced *FGF14a* variant) as the etiology of the autosomal-dominant SCA27 in an extended Dutch family (*van Swieten et al.*, 2003). The specific mechanism(s) by which the human *FGF14* mutant or knockout of *Fgf14* in mouse affected neuronal signaling and led to ataxia was subsequently explained by the discovery, via a yeast two-hybrid strategy, that *FGF12* serves as a binding partner for the C terminus of Naᵥ1.9 (*Liu et al.*, 2001). Several studies then showed that FHFs, through their interaction with Naᵥ C-termini, can modulate Na⁺ channel currents (*Liu et al.*, 2003; *Lou et al.*, 2005). Moreover, when expressed in cultured hippocampal neurons, the SCA27 missense mutant *FGF14b*¹⁵⁰S decreased Naᵥ channel currents and depressed neuronal excitability in a dominant-negative manner (*Laezza et al.*, 2007). Ataxia phenotypes have also been associated with a frame-shift mutation that caused early termination of *FGF14*, and a chromosomal translocation that disrupted *FGF14* (*Dalski et al.*, 2005; *Misceo et al.*, 2009). In addition, some experiments have hinted that *FGF14* can regulate other neuronal processes, such as synaptic transmission in hippocampal neurons (*Xiao et al.*, 2007). How *FGF14* contributes to these other signaling pathways is not known, and whether mechanisms other than Na⁺ channel dysfunction contribute to the ataxia phenotype has not been examined.

Here, we focused on the role of *FGF14* at the cerebellar granule cell to Purkinje cell synapse. We discovered that *FGF14* in granule cells is a potent regulator of P/Q-type Caᵥ2.1 Ca²⁺ channels (the dominant presynaptic Ca²⁺ channels in granule cells) and synaptic transmission. Further, the SCA27-causing mutant *FGF14* impaired Caᵥ channels in cerebellar neurons and affected synaptic transmission at the granule cell to Purkinje cell synapse. Thus, *FGF14* is a regulator of multiple ionic currents, and the pathogenic effects of mutant *FGF14* are likely mediated by dysregulation of both Ca²⁺ channels and Na⁺ channels.

RESULTS

**FGF14 Affects Cav2 Channels in Cerebellar Neurons**

Although FGF14 regulates Nav channel currents in granule cells ([Goldfarb et al., 2007](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2007.01.029)), we suspected that additional mechanisms might contribute to the SCA27 phenotype based on our observation that most SCA-associated channelopathies or the related episodic ataxias result from perturbed Ca²⁺ channel function ([Shakkottai and Paulson, 2009](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2009.04.017)), and the observation that loss-of-function mutations in Cav2.1 underlie the ataxia phenotype in *tottering* mice ([Fletcher et al., 1996](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0896-6273(00)80120-8)). We therefore first asked whether FGF14 affected voltage-gated Ca²⁺ channels in granule cells within mixed primary rat cerebellar cultures containing both Purkinje cells and granule cells, which could be readily distinguished by their characteristic morphology and membrane capacitance (granule cell: 8.8 ± 0.2 pF, n = 105; Purkinje cell: 15.4 ± 0.6 pF, n = 50). To assess the effects of FGF14 on voltage-gated Ca²⁺ channels in granule cells, we recorded Ca²⁺ currents after FGF14 knockdown by small hairpin RNA (shRNA).

A ramp protocol with 10 mM Ba²⁺ as the charge carrier, as shown in Figure 1A, revealed that FGF14 knockdown significantly reduced Ca²⁺ channel currents (summary data normalized to cell capacitance are shown in Figure 1B for FGF14 shRNA, scrambled shRNA, and a GFP transfection control). Peak inward Ba²⁺ currents were also elicited with a step protocol in which currents were evoked by a 500 ms voltage step from –80 mV to –10 mV, revealing that FGF14 knockdown significantly reduced Ca²⁺ channel current density (Figures 1C and 1D). We next assessed whether FGF14 affected influx through Ca²⁺ channels in response to an action potential waveform (APW), by isolating the Cd²⁺-sensitive integrated current. We found that knockdown of endogenous FGF14 by shRNA significantly decreased the integrated current compared with transfection with GFP or scrambled shRNA (Figures 1E and 1F).

We validated the efficacy of the FGF14 shRNA construct in hippocampal neurons, which (because they also express the related FGF13) allowed us to test specificity. Figure S1A shows effective knockdown of the axon initial segment (AIS)-enriched FGF14 by shRNA, but not by a scrambled control. FGF13, however, was unaffected (Figure S1B). The FGF14 shRNA, but not the scrambled control, also reduced FGF14 protein expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells (Figure S1C). After confirming the efficacy and specificity of the FGF14 shRNA, we transfected it (or a scrambled control shRNA or GFP) into granule cells and recorded the Ca²⁺ currents.

Since 95% of the somatodendritic Ca²⁺ current in granule cells is carried by Cav2.1 P/Q-type channels ([Jun et al., 1999](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0896-6273(00)80120-8)), as well as a similar fraction of presynaptic Ca²⁺ influx at the granule cell to Purkinje cell synapse ([Mintz et al., 1995](https://doi.org/10.1016/0896-6273(95)90029-0)), we tested whether FGF14 specifically affected Cav2.1 P/Q Ca²⁺ channel currents in a heterologous expression system. The Cav2.1 pore-forming α₁A subunit and the accessory β₂b and α₂δ subunits were expressed in HEK 293T cells, and currents were evoked by step depolarizations with 10 mM Ba²⁺ as the charge carrier (Figure 2A). The current-voltage (I-V) relationship shows that coexpression of FGF14b increased current density over a broad range of voltages (Figure 2B) without affecting the kinetics of

activation or steady-state inactivation (Figures S2A and S2B; Table 1). The integrated inward current through Cav2.1 in response to an APW also increased with FGF14 coexpression (Figures 2C and 2D). Coexpression of FGF14b also increased the current density of the other major presynaptic Ca²⁺ channel, the Cav2.2 N-type channel (Figure 2E). In contrast, FGF14b did not affect the Cav1.2 L-type or Cav2.3 R-type channels, which are predominantly somatodendritic in location (Figures 2F and 2G). Together, these results showed that endogenous FGF14 affected granule cell Ca²⁺ channels and that FGF14 was capable of regulating the presynaptic Cav2.1 and Cav2.2 Ca²⁺ channels.

Because FGF14 did not affect the Cav2.1 kinetics of activation or steady-state inactivation, we suspected that FGF14 might increase the current density by increasing the number of channels at the plasma membrane. In HEK 293T cells expressing Cav2.1 channels, we therefore measured the gating charge, with and without FGF14 coexpression, as a means of assessing the number of channels at the cell surface. We isolated the gating charge by depolarizing the cell from a holding potential of –80 mV to the reversal potential (determined individually for each cell, average +43.2 mV ± 0.9 mV, n = 27) and eliminated any remaining ionic current by blocking the channels with Cd²⁺ (300 μM). Figures 3A and 3B show that coexpression of FGF14b increased the gating charge by ~35% compared with the GFP-only control, suggesting that FGF14b does increase the number of channels at the plasma membrane. This increase in gating charge could be attributed solely to the transfected Cav2.1 channels, and not to FGF14b effects upon endogenous ionic currents in HEK 293T cells, because transfection of FGF14b in the absence of Cav2.1 did not increase the gating charge compared with cells transfected with GFP only (2.2 ± 0.2 fC/pF, n = 12, and 2.0 ± 0.3 fC/pF, n = 10, respectively; p > 0.05).

**Presynaptic FGF14 Regulates Baseline Transmission at the Granule Cell to Purkinje Cell Synapse**

Having established that FGF14 affects Cav2.1 channels, the predominant presynaptic Ca²⁺ channels at the granule cell to Purkinje cell synapse, and given that FGF14 is abundant in granule cell axons (Wang et al., 2002), we explored whether FGF14 affected synaptic transmission at the granule cell to Purkinje cell synapse. We used paired recordings to identify a granule cell to Purkinje cell synapse in which only the presynaptic granule cell was transfected with FGF14 shRNA, a scrambled control shRNA, or GFP (Figure 4A). We then evoked unitary excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) in the presence of 20 μM (–) bicuculline. Knockdown of FGF14 in granule cells reduced the EPSC amplitude in Purkinje cells by >80% compared with EPSCs recorded from pairs in which the granule cell was transfected with GFP only or with the control scrambled shRNA (Figures 4B and 4C). Because FGF14 is also present in Purkinje cell somata (Shakkottai et al., 2009), we also checked whether FGF14 exerted postsynaptic effects in Purkinje cells by examining glutamate- and GABA-evoked responses after knocking down endogenous FGF14 by shRNA. We obtained

Activation kinetics were obtained from fits with a Boltzmann equation of the form: $G = G_{\text{max}}/[1 + \exp(V - V_{1/2})/k]$, where $G_{\text{max}}$ is the extrapolated maximum Ca<sup>2+</sup> conductance, $V$ is the test voltage, $V_{1/2}$ is the half-activation voltage, and $k$ is the slope factor. Steady-state inactivation were obtained from fits with a Boltzmann relationship, $I/I_{\text{max}} = (1 + \exp((V - V_{1/2})/k))^{-1}$.

glutamate- and GABA-evoked currents by directly applying the drugs to Purkinje cells. We found that neither glutamate- nor GABA-evoked inward currents were altered compared with currents from Purkinje cells transfected with a scrambled control shRNA or GFP only (Figures S3A and S3B), suggesting FGF14 had no effect on postsynaptic responses.

### FGF14 Regulates Vesicular Turnover and Short-Term Synaptic Plasticity

We hypothesized that FGF14 knockdown in granule cells reduced EPSCs at the granule cell to Purkinje cell synapse because of a diminished presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> current through Cav2.1 channels, consistent with the reduced Cav2.1 Ca<sup>2+</sup> current seen in Figure 2. We therefore tested whether FGF14 might affect presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in granule cells. We assessed this indirectly by two different means. First, we measured synaptic vesicular turnover after a 90 s depolarization with 90 mM KCl. We measured vesicular turnover with FM4-64. Styryl FM dyes become trapped in vesicles that have undergone endocytosis following synaptic activity (Ryan et al., 1993), providing a measure of vesicular turnover that is closely correlated with the amount of presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx (Evans and Cousin, 2007; Yamashita, 2012). We transfected the mixed cultures with shRNA to knock down FGF14 or a scrambled control shRNA, and quantified FM4-64 uptake in granule cells after a 90 s depolarization by 90 mM KCl. The styryl dye was included only during the 90 s depolarization, after which the neurons were immediately washed then fixed. In these sparsely transfected cultures, we followed a GFP-positive granule cell axon until it synapsed with an untransfected Purkinje cell, and then counted the number of punctae that were positive for FM4-64 and GFP fluorescence (Figure 5A). In all cases, quantification was performed with the experimenter blinded to the identity of the transfection. Knockdown of FGF14 reduced the number of recycled punctae by 54% compared with scrambled control shRNA (Figures 5B and 5C). Second, we assessed

short-term plasticity. Presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx plays an essential role in neurotransmitter release in CNS synapses and also contributes to short-term synaptic plasticity. A reduction in presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx is predicted to increase the paired pulse ratio (PPR) in response to two closely spaced stimuli (Zucker and Regehr, 2002). In the presence of 20 μM (-) bicuculline, we measured the PPR in response to two stimuli at 10 Hz (Figures 5D and 5E) and found that when the granule cell expressed GFP only or the scrambled control shRNA, the PPR was near unity ($1.03 \pm 0.04$, $n = 16$, and $1.05 \pm 0.06$, $n = 10$, respectively). Knockdown of FGF14, however, significantly increased the PPR ($1.45 \pm 0.11$, $n = 27$), consistent with an effect on presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry. Together with the reduction in vesicular turnover after FGF14 knockdown, these data provided corroborating evidence that presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx was reduced by FGF14 knockdown.

### The SCA27-Causing FGF14 Mutant Affects Synaptic Transmission in a Dominant-Negative Manner

We next addressed the effects of the FGF14b<sup>F150S</sup> mutant associated with SCA27. We chose the “b” splice variant for study because it is the most abundantly expressed in brain (Wang et al., 2000). First, we examined whether FGF14b<sup>F150S</sup> affected voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel currents (with 10 mM Ba<sup>2+</sup> as a charge carrier) by step or ramp depolarization in granule cells. As shown in Figures 6A–6D, transfection of FGF14b<sup>F150S</sup> significantly reduced the Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel current density. This decrease in Ca<sup>2+</sup> current was also observed in response to an APW (Figures 6E and 6F). In contrast, overexpression of FGF14b<sup>WT</sup> markedly increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents in response to a step depolarization, ramp protocol, or an APW. Since FGF14 increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents above control, these data suggest that the effects of endogenous FGF14 are not saturated (Figures 6A–6F).

See also Figures S1 and S3.

We next examined whether the FGF14b<sup>F150S</sup> mutant affected presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in granule cells by using FM4-64-labeled vesicular recycling as an indicator. Compared with control, the SCA27 mutant reduced vesicular recycling (Figures 7A–7C). In contrast, overexpression of FGF14b<sup>WT</sup> increased vesicular recycling (Figures 7A–7C), consistent with the observed effects on total Ca<sup>2+</sup> current. Finally, we used paired recordings to measure EPSCs in Purkinje cells after stimulation of a granule cell transfected with FGF14b<sup>F150S</sup>, which allowed us to measure directly the effect of FGF14b<sup>F150S</sup> on synaptic transmission. As shown in Figures 7D and 7E, expression of FGF14b<sup>F150S</sup> in a granule cell exerted a dominant-negative effect and markedly reduced the EPSCs’ amplitude in Purkinje cells by 63%. Overexpression of FGF14b<sup>WT</sup>, in contrast, markedly increased the EPSCs by 317%, which also suggests that the effects of endogenous FGF14 were not saturating.

## DISCUSSION

Since the initial discovery of FHFs (Smallwood et al., 1996), understanding of their physiological roles has evolved greatly. The recognition of FHFs as Na<sub>v</sub> channel binding partners and modulators, demonstration that *Fgf14*<sup>−/−</sup> mice displayed ataxia, identification of *FGF14* as the locus for SCA27, and demonstration that FHFs cannot activate FGF receptors redirected most attention to the influence of FHFs intracellularly and specifically focused attention on their roles in neuronal excitability (Liu et al., 2001, 2003; Olsen et al., 2003; van Swieten et al., 2003; Wang et al., 2002). Further focus on modulation of Na<sub>v</sub> channels followed the demonstration that the SCA27 mutant version of FGF14 acted as a dominant negative to suppress Na<sub>v</sub> currents and excitability in hippocampal neurons (Laezza et al., 2007), and that granule cells from *Fgf14*<sup>−/−</sup>;*Fgf12*<sup>−/−</sup> mice displayed a deficit in intrinsic excitability and altered Na<sub>v</sub> channel inactivation properties (Goldfarb et al., 2007). The ataxia phenotype common to *Fgf14*<sup>−/−</sup> mice and patients with the dominant-negative FGF14b<sup>F150S</sup> mutation has thus been suspected to result from Na<sub>v</sub> channel dysfunction in granule cells or Purkinje cells (Goldfarb et al., 2007; Shakkottai et al., 2009).

Nevertheless, several observations suggest that FHFs might possess capabilities beyond Na<sub>v</sub> channel regulation. For example, CA1 synapses in *Fgf14*<sup>−/−</sup> mice have fewer total and docked vesicles (Xiao et al., 2007), and *Fgf13* knockdown in Xenopus oocytes influences neuronal development by affecting bone morphogenetic protein receptor activation of the MEK5-ERK5 pathway (Nishimoto and Nishida, 2007). Moreover, certain FHFs localize to the nucleus (Munoz-Sanjuan et al., 2000), a subcellular location in which FHFs are unlikely to influence Na<sub>v</sub> channels, and FHFs appear to have binding partners other than Na<sub>v</sub> channels, such as kinase scaffolds (Schoorlemmer and Goldfarb, 2001). In this context, our demonstration that FGF14 regulates Ca<sub>v</sub>2.1 channel currents and synaptic transmission at the granule cell to Purkinje cell synapse adds an additional dimension to FHF function. How FGF14 affects these processes is unclear, but we suspect that the mechanism differs from how FHFs affect Na<sub>v</sub> channels, which involves direct binding with the Na<sub>v</sub> C terminus (Wang et al., 2012). In contrast, we were unable to detect direct interactions between FGF14 and Ca<sub>v</sub>2 channels by either coimmunoprecipitation or recombinant protein-binding studies targeting intracellular domains of Ca<sub>v</sub>2 channels or their auxiliary subunits. Consistent with our observations, FGF14 was not annotated as a component of the Ca<sub>v</sub>2-anchored proteome in a recent analysis (Müller et al., 2010). Thus, we hypothesize that the FGF14 acts indirectly, or possibly transiently, to increase the number of Ca<sub>v</sub>2 channels at the plasma membrane.

Importantly, our data provide a mechanism by which FGF14 could affect synaptic transmission at a granule cell to Purkinje cell synapse, thereby offering insight into the etiology of the disease phenotypes in humans with SCA27 and the ataxia

phenotype in *Fgf14*<sup>−/−</sup> mice. We have shown that the mutant FGF14b<sup>F150S</sup> acts as a dominant negative, reducing Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel currents in granule cells in a manner similar to the effect of shRNA knockdown of endogenous FGF14. The dominant-negative effect of FGF14b<sup>F150S</sup> on Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents in granule cells and the consequent reduction in EPSCs in Purkinje cells are both consistent with the observation that the mutant also acts as a dominant negative to reduce Na<sup>+</sup> channel currents in hippocampal neurons (Laezza et al., 2007). Our data measuring gating charge point to a potential role for FGF14 in trafficking Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels to, or regulating removal from, the plasma membrane. As such, FHFs may have a broader role in trafficking ion channels, since we recently demonstrated that endogenous FGF13 increases the number of cell-surface Nav1.5 Na<sup>+</sup> channels in cardiomyocytes (Wang et al., 2011). On the other hand, our data also underline the concept that individual FHFs confer channel-specific regulatory effects. For example, although FGF14 regulated Cav2.1 and Cav2.2, the major presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, FGF14 did not affect currents through Cav1.2 or Cav2.3, which are mainly restricted to the somatodendritic compartments. Such data argue against the possibility that FGF14 mediates its effects via interaction with a Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel auxiliary protein, which would be common to all Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, but could suggest that FGF14 controls a regulator, such as a kinase, that has effects specific to individual types of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels.

The FGF14b<sup>F150S</sup>-induced reduction in Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel currents fits well with the observation that most SCA-associated channelopathies or the related episodic ataxias result from perturbed Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel function (Shakkottai and Paulson, 2009), and the observation that loss-of-function mutations in Cav2.1 underlie the ataxia phenotype in tottering mice (Fletcher et al., 1996). Thus, the previously identified actions of FGF14 on granule cell Nav currents (Goldfarb et al., 2007), together with its effects on granule cell Cav currents and the consequences for Purkinje cell EPSCs described herein, suggest that altered Purkinje cell output from the cerebellum in *FGF14* loss-of-function or dominant-negative mutations derives from multiple mechanisms. Along with the previously demonstrated FGF14b<sup>F150S</sup>-dependent reduction in Nav currents and channel availability (Laezza et al., 2007), these data suggest that FGF14 is truly multimodal and the ataxia phenotype caused by mutant FGF14 results from several independent mechanisms.

Neurons were transfected with the different constructs followed by immunocytochemical staining to determine the efficacy and specificity of knockdown. The most effective shRNA has the sequence 5′- CGCGTGGAGGCAAACCAGTCAACAAGTG CATTCAGAGATGCACCTGTTGACTGGTTTGCCTTTTTTAT-3′ and was used for the experiments described in this work. A scrambled shRNA that exhibits no significant homology to genes in rodent genomes was used as a control. This scrambled shRNA was previously described (Wang et al., 2011).

### Primary Cerebellar Culture and Transfection

Primary dissociated cerebellar cultures were prepared using minor modifications of a previously described procedure for preparation of hippocampal cultures (Wang et al., 2007). Briefly, the cerebellum cortex was dissected on ice from P0–P1 male or female Wistar rat pups, digested with 0.25% trypsin for 10 min at 37°C with Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM; Sigma), and dissociated into single cells by gentle trituration. The cells were seeded onto coverslips coated with 50 μg/ml poly-D-lysine (Sigma) and 25 μg/ml laminin (Sigma) at a density of 2.5–3.0 × 10⁵ cells/coverslip (12 × 12 mm coverslip) in DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS). The cells were maintained in a humidified incubator in 5% CO₂ at 37°C. After 15–16 h, the medium was replaced with basal medium Eagle (BME; Sigma) supplemented with 2% B27 (Invitrogen), 1% or 5% FBS, 25 μM uridine, 70 μM 5-fluorodeoxyuridine, and 20 mM KCl. After 5–7 days in vitro (DIV) culture, the neurons were transiently transfected with 1 μg plasmid DNA per coverslip with calcium phosphate, as described previously (Wang et al., 2007). Experiments were carried out 7–12 days after transfection.

### HEK 293T Cell Culture and Transfection

HEK 293T cells were maintained in DMEM containing 10% FBS at 37°C in a 5% CO₂ incubator. The cells were plated in 60-mm tissue culture dishes, grown to 65%–75% confluency, and transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) in serum-reduced medium (Opti-MEM; Invitrogen) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The total amount of cDNA used per dish was 8 μg, which included 3 μg of Caᵥ2.1, Caᵥ2.2, Caᵥ2.3, or Caᵥ1.2 subunits (α₁A, α₁B, α₁E, or α₁C, respectively); 2.2 μg of β₂b; 1.8 μg of α₂δ; and 2 μg of the empty plRES2-acGFP1 vector or FGF14b in 5 ml transfection medium. After 24 h of transfection, the cells were replated on coverslips coated with 50 μg/ml poly-D-lysine (Sigma) at a low density for recording.

### Electrophysiological Recordings

Whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings were obtained from cultured cerebellar granule cells and Purkinje cells 7–12 days after transfection. The granule cells and Purkinje cells were identified based on their size and morphology. For paired recording experiments, whole-cell recordings used an Axopatch 200A and 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments), the signal was filtered at 2–5 kHz bandwidth. The data acquisition was performed using a DigiData 1322A (Axon Instruments) digitizer and stored on a personal computer running pClamp software, version 10. For EPSCs recording, patch pipettes with 5–6 MΩ resistances were filled with internal solution containing (in mM) 120 K-gluconate, 10 KCl, 5 MgCl₂, 0.6 EGTA, 5 HEPES, 10 phosphocreatine, 50 U/ml creatine-phosphokinase, 2 Mg-ATP, and 0.2 GTP, pH 7.3 with KOH (290–300 mOsm). The external solution contained (in mM) 135 NaCl, 2 CaCl₂, 1 MgCl₂, 5 KCl, 10 glucose, and 5 HEPES, pH 7.3, with NaOH (300–310 mOsm). To block GABAₐ receptor activity, 20 μM (−) bicuculline was added to the external solution. A brief 5 mV hyperpolarizing step was performed at the end of each sweep to monitor series resistance, capacitance, and input (leak) resistance throughout the

experiment. Cells were rejected from analysis if the series resistance changed by >15%–20%.

Neuronal Ca²⁺ currents were recorded using an EPC 10 USB patch amplifier (HEKA Elektronik). The signal was filtered at 2.9 Hz and digitized at 20 Hz. To record currents through voltage-gated Ca²⁺ channels, we used a bath solution containing (in mM) 124 NaCl, 20 TEA-Cl, 1 MgCl₂, 10 BaCl₂, 5 HEPES, and 10 glucose, pH 7.3, with NaOH (300–310 mOsm). The internal solution contained (in mM) 115 CsCl, 20 TEA-Cl, 1 CaCl₂, 2 MgCl₂, 10 HEPES, and 2 Mg-ATP, pH 7.3, with CsOH (290–300 mOsm). To block Na⁺ currents, 1 μM tetrodotoxin (TTX) was supplemented in the external solution.

Whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings were obtained from HEK 293T cells at room temperature 2–3 days after transfection using external and internal solutions as described above. The liquid junction potential and series resistance for these recordings were not corrected, and cells were discarded if series resistance was >10 MΩ.

**Protocols and Data Analysis**

Data analysis was performed using PatchMaster, FitMaster, and Clampfit 10.2 software. All averaged data presented the mean ± SEM. Statistical significance was determined using Student’s t test or one-way ANOVA. In whole-cell voltage-clamp mode, unitary EPSCs were obtained by stimulating a transfected presynaptic granule cell and recording from a neighboring untransfected postsynaptic Purkinje cell 7–12 days after transfection (Figure 4A). To elicit unitary EPSCs, the two cells were both held at –70 mV membrane potential and a 20 ms depolarization pulse was delivered to the granule cell. The EPSC amplitude was determined by an average of five to ten EPSCs from each cell. The neuronal Ca²⁺ current was obtained by 500 ms step depolarization from a holding potential of –80 mV to –10 mV or by ramp from a holding potential of –80 mV to +50 mV in 1 s. The current amplitude was normalized to each cell’s capacitance.

Recombinant HEK 293T cells were voltage clamped at a holding potential (Vh) of –80 mV, and Cav2.1, Cav2.2, Cav2.3, or Cav1.2 current Ica was elicited by depolarizing pulses of 300 ms from –80 mV to +60 mV (in 10 mV increments). Peak Ica amplitude during the test pulse was divided by the corresponding cell capacitance to obtain a measure of current density (pA/pF). Current density-to-voltage (I-V) relationships were plotted. Cav2.1 currents were also evoked by an APW command. The APW was modified from a previous study (Borst et al., 1995). In brief, the APW began at –80 mV and peaked at +33 mV with a 2 ms half-amplitude duration. The maximal rising and falling slopes were +127 V/s and –52 V/s, respectively. Ca²⁺ channel currents were defined as the CdCl₂ (300 μM) sensitive fraction. The gating charge was obtained by depolarization from the holding potential (–80 mV) to the reversal potential (40–50 mV, determined individually for each cell) for 20 ms.

FM dye staining was performed on cultured cerebellar neurons. On day 6 (DIV), the neurons were transfected with pIRES2-AcGFP1 (control), scrambled control shRNA, FGF14 shRNA, FGF14bWT, or FGF14bF150S. FM4-64 (Molecular Probes) dye loading was performed 9 days after transfection (15 DIV). The neurons were first washed in Hank’s balanced salt solution (HBSS [in mM]: 139 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 10 HEPES, 10 glucose, 2 CaCl₂, and 1.3 MgCl₂, pH 7.3, 300 mOsm), and then depolarized for 90 s at room temperature with 90 mM KCl solution (in mM: 48.5 NaCl, 90 KCl, 10 glucose, 10 HEPES, 2 CaCl₂, 1.3 MgCl₂, 0.05 APV, and 0.02 DNQX) containing 15 μM FM4-64. The neurons were immediately washed for 2 min with a calcium-free HBSS containing 0.1 mM Advasep-7 (Sigma) and then rinsed three times with HBSS to remove all nonspecific membrane bound FM4-64. Finally, the cells were fixed for 10 min with 4% paraformaldehyde/4% sucrose.

(E) Averaged amplitude of Purkinje cell EPSCs (mean ± SEM) when the presynaptic granule cell expressed GFP control (n = 14), FGF14WT (n = 19), or FGF14bF150S (n = 10). **\*\*p < 0.01** versus control.

Imaging was performed with a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope using an oil immersion 40X objective. GFP and FM4-64 dye were excited at 488 and 543 nm, respectively. All images were collected at 1024 × 1024 pixel resolution. The nerve terminals of transfected neurons were identified by tracing the GFP-positive axons. Synaptic punctae incorporation along a traced axonal process was identified at a region away from the cell body. For quantification, the experimenter was blinded to the identity of the transfected plasmid. A 45 μm × 45 μm square region of interest was selected and the numbers of punctae were calculated using NIH ImageJ software. Particles <0.3 μm in diameter were excluded from analyses.
