The role of CD22 and other inhibitory co-receptors in  
B-cell activation  

Lars Nitschke  

Inhibitory co-receptors downmodulate B-cell receptor (BCR)  
signalling by setting a signalling threshold that prevents  
overstimulation of B cells. Activation of these inhibitory  
co-receptors occurs by phosphorylation on their cytoplasmic  
inhibitory immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motifs  
(ITIMs), followed by recruitment of the tyrosine phosphatase  
SHP-1 or the lipid phosphatase SHIP, and depends on their  
association with the BCR. Recent evidence shows that B-cell  
signal inhibition is regulated by ligand binding of inhibitory  
receptors.

Introduction  
When B cells interact with antigens, transmembrane  
signal transduction takes place through the B cell antigen  
receptor (BCR), leading to modulation of gene expression,  
resulting in activation, anergy or apoptosis of B cells.  
Accessory co-receptors expressed on the B-cell surface  
modulate BCR signalling either positively or negatively.  
These co-receptors include the low-affinity receptor for  
IgG (FcγRII), CD22 and CD72, which negatively regulate  
BCR signalling and are thus called inhibitory BCR  
co-receptors. Inhibitory co-receptors set the BCR signalling  
threshold and thereby prevent overstimulation of the  
B cells. These inhibitory co-receptors contain immunoreceptor  
tyrosine-based inhibition motifs (ITIMs) in the  
cytoplasmic tails. When phosphorylated, ITIMs recruit  
inhibitory intracellular signalling proteins, including protein  
tyrosine phosphatases (SH2-domain-containing protein  
tyrosine phosphatase-1 [SHP-1] and SHP-2) and the  
lipid phosphatase SH2-domain-containing inositol phosphatase  
(SHIP). These phosphatases counteract the  
BCR-induced activation signalling cascades that are  
mediated by phosphorylation of various signalling molecules. Phosphorylation of the ITIMs in these co-receptors  
occurs only when the co-receptors associate with the  
BCR.

New evidence suggests that BCR association of inhibitory  
receptors is a process that is regulated by ligand binding.  
The mechanisms of inhibition by various mouse inhibitory  
receptors are discussed in this review, with some  
emphasis on CD22.

Inhibition of B cell signalling by CD22  
CD22 is a 140 kDa type I membrane protein and is a  
member of the Siglec (sialic-acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin) family, a family of inhibitory adhesion  
receptors expressed on leukocytes. CD22 is expressed in  
a B-cell lineage specific fashion, starting at the pre-B cell  
stage. CD22 has seven immunoglobulin (Ig)-like extracellular domains and a cytoplasmic tail containing six  
tyrosines, three of which belong to the ITIM sequences.

SHP recruitment to CD22  
After the crosslinking of membrane-associated IgM  
(mIgM), CD22 is quickly tyrosine phosphorylated on  
its cytoplasmic tail due to its association with mIgM.  
The phosphorylated ITIMs of CD22 recruit the tyrosine  
phosphatase SHP-1 [1], which plays a crucial role in signal  
inhibition by CD22. Indeed, CD22-deficient B cells show  
strongly increased Ca²⁺ mobilisation after BCR crosslinking [2–5], and increased tyrosine phosphorylation of  
Vav-1 [6], CD19 [7] and SLP65/BLNK [8], all of which  
are positively involved in Ca²⁺ signalling (Figure 1). The  
increased tyrosine phosphorylation of these potential  
SHP-1 substrates, however, cannot fully explain the  
increased Ca²⁺ signalling in CD22-deficient mice. Recently, interesting experiments demonstrated that CD22  
stimulates Ca²⁺ efflux from B cells and thereby negatively  
regulates Ca²⁺ signalling. CD22 interacts with and activates the Ca²⁺ pump plasma membrane Ca²⁺ ATPase 4  
(PMCA4), and this activation is dependent on CD22  
tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of SHP-1 [9**]  
(Figure 1).

Role of other CD22-binding signalling proteins  
In addition to SHP-1, other signalling proteins are  
recruited via their SH2 domains to the tyrosine-phosphorylated tail of CD22; these include Syk, phospholipase Cγ2 (PLCγ2), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K),  
Grb2, and Shc [10–12] (Figure 1). The lipid phosphatase  
SHIP is recruited to the CD22 cytoplasmic tail in a  
complex with Grb2 and Shc [12]. Grb2 negatively regulates Ca²⁺ signalling in the chicken DT40 B-cell line

Regulation of B-cell receptor signalling by CD22. Upon ligation of mlgM tyrosines of the CD22 cytoplasmic tail are phosphorylated by the BCR-associated kinase Lyn. The tyrosines of CD22 that have been mapped as interaction sites are indicated with intracellular binding proteins. A clear function has only been shown for binding of tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1. SHP-1 dephosphorylates intracellular signalling molecules (indicated by –). BCR signalling triggers depletion of intracellular Ca²⁺ stores of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This activates opening of Ca²⁺-release-activated channels (CRACs) and triggers Ca²⁺ influx. CD22 (via SHP-1) activates (indicated by +) the Ca²⁺ pump PMCA4 and thereby controls Ca²⁺ efflux. Abbreviations: IP3, inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate; IP3R, IP3 receptor.

[13]. Whether or not Grb2 and SHIP contribute to the negative regulation of Ca²⁺ mobilisation by CD22 is still unclear. So far the only clear downstream mediator of Ca²⁺ mobilisation is SHP-1. Although CD22-deficient mice show that the overall function of CD22 is inhibitory [2–5], these mice also have impaired responses to thymus-independent type II (TI-II) antigens and have impaired B-cell proliferation after anti-IgM stimulation, which could result from the loss of positive regulatory functions of CD22. Yet, the reduced response of CD22⁻/⁻ mice to TI-II antigens can be explained by the finding that their marginal zone (MZ) B-cell population is reduced [14]; a population that is crucial for TI-II responses. The impaired anti-IgM-induced proliferation suggests that CD22, perhaps via Grb2 activation, directly stimulates mitogenic signalling. CD22-deficient B cells, however, have no strong impairment of the extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, and impairment of Jun amino-terminal kinase phosphorylation is controversial [12,15]. So, no clear positive signalling function for CD22 has been demonstrated so far. MHC class II molecules can use the signalling components Igα and Igβ of the BCR for signal transduction. However, CD22 is excluded from MHC II aggregates on the surface and therefore likely does not inhibit this signalling [16].

In B-cell lines it was shown that CD22 is not phosphorylated upon ligation of membrane-associated IgG (mIgG) by antigens, and does not inhibit signalling through mIgG, whereas CD22 negatively regulates signalling through both mIgM and mIgD [17]. Chimeric constructs demonstrated that the cytoplasmic tail of mIgG is responsible for this effect. These studies suggest an immunoglobulin isotype-specific regulation by CD22, but still need to be tested in mouse models for memory B cells *in vivo*.

The function of the ligand-binding domain of CD22

The Siglec CD22 binds specifically with its amino-terminal V-set immunoglobulin domain to Neu5Aca2-6Galβ1–4Glc(NAc) or to α2,6-linked sialic acid (2,6Sia), which is a common structure found on N-linked glycans and expressed on the surface of many cell types. The affinity of CD22 for 2,6Sia is very low (10⁻⁴ M) and does not differ greatly for several sialylated proteins or even for a 2,6Sia-carrying polyacrylamide [18]. This suggests that it is only the presence and density of the carbohydrate, but not the protein backbone, that determines binding. It is now evident that CD22 is bound to ligands *in cis* (i.e. to ligands expressed on the same cellular surface) on the majority of B cells [19–21]. Experiments in human and mouse B-cell lines show that this *in cis* ligand binding regulates CD22 signalling. Two different approaches were used to block CD22 ligand binding [22,23], and in both cases CD22 had less tyrosine phosphorylation, recruited less SHP-1 protein, and Ca²⁺ mobilisation was increased after BCR stimulation. CD22 knock-in mice, which were recently generated, with either mutated or lacking 2,6Sia-binding domains confirmed the importance of CD22 ligand binding for the function of this co-receptor. The phenotype of these mice (upregulated MHC class II expression, enhanced B-cell turnover, reduced numbers of recirculating B cells in the bone marrow, reduced numbers of MZ B cells and reduced anti-IgM-induced proliferation) is identical to the phenotype of CD22-deficient mice that lack the whole protein [24**]. Surprisingly, however, and in contrast to the cell-line studies mentioned above, tyrosine phosphorylation of CD22 and Ca²⁺ mobilisation after anti-IgM stimulation was normal in the CD22 knock-in mice with a mutated CD22 ligand-binding domain. From these studies one could conclude that the 2,6Sia-binding activity of CD22, and not the inhibition of Ca²⁺ signalling, is the crucial function of CD22, causing the largely identical phenotype of the two mouse lines. An alternative explanation, which might be more likely, is that low-level enhanced Ca²⁺ signalling by CD22 knock-in B cells was not detected following stimulation with high concentrations of anti-IgM antibodies, but might still occur *in vivo* due to low-affinity interactions with the micro-environment. This could cause basal overstimulation of B cells in CD22 knock-in mice and therefore an identical phenotype to CD22-deficient animals.

Various membrane glycoproteins, including mIgM and CD45, carry 2,6Sia. Indeed, both IgM and CD45 were recently shown to be prominent CD22 binding partners *in cis* [25] (*Figure 2*). Mutating the ligand-binding domain of CD22, however, did not affect its association to CD45 or IgM. Therefore, the crucial 2,6Sia-carrying *cis* ligands for CD22 are still unknown. Ligand interactions of CD22 *in trans* can also control BCR signalling by regulating CD22 activation. One study showed that B-cell activation by antigen displayed on the surface of a target cell was depressed if the target cell co-expressed 2,6Sia [26]. An interpretation of this is that interactions with the cells that co-express antigens and 2,6Sia induce co-ligation of BCR with CD22, leading to enhanced phosphorylation of CD22 and augmented recruitment of SHP-1 to the BCR (*Figure 2*). Similarly, it was shown by immunofluorescence that CD22 redistributes on the B-cell surface to sites of cell contact with T cells or other B cells [27].

Inhibition of B cell signalling by CD72

CD72 is a type II transmembrane protein of the C-type lectin family. CD72 is expressed primarily on B cells, but also on dendritic cells (DCs), macrophages and subpopulations of T cells. CD72 contains an ITIM and an ITIM-like sequence in the cytoplasmic part. It has been shown that crosslinking of the BCR induces phosphorylation of tyrosines on CD72, resulting in its association with SHP-1 [28–30]. However, direct association of CD72 with the BCR has not been demonstrated so far. Tyrosine phosphorylation of both CD72 and CD22 is stronger when antigens are used for stimulation, rather than anti-immunoglobulin antibodies [31*]. The creation of CD72-deficient mice established that CD72 has an inhibitory role in B cell signalling; B cells of these mice have a mildly increased Ca²⁺ response and hyperproliferation after anti-IgM stimulation [32]. Anti-CD72 antibody treatment can activate signalling pathways, such as tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ2 and CD19, and activation of Lyn, Blk and Bruton’s tyrosine kinases (BTKs) [33]. Furthermore, CD72-deficient B-cell lines have impaired activation of these molecules [34]. CD72 stimulation also modulates anti-IgM-induced apoptotic signalling [35]. Whether these findings demonstrate a positive signalling function of CD72, or whether these effects can be explained by removal of CD72 by anti-CD72 crosslinking from the BCR and therefore a release of inhibition [31*] is still a matter of discussion.

CD100, a member of the semamorphin family, was recently identified as a CD72 ligand [36]. The semamorphin family is primarily expressed in the nervous system, although some members are also expressed in immune cells. CD100 is expressed abundantly on the membrane of T cells and weakly on B cells and DCs, but it is upregulated after cellular activation. Soluble CD100 can be released from the cell surface by proteolysis [37]. Interaction of CD72 with CD100 reduces tyrosine

Model for the regulation of CD22 inhibition by ligand binding. CD22 can perform cis and trans interactions to its ligand α2,6 linked sialic acid (shown as blue circles). Most CD22 is bound ('masked') by endogenous ligands in cis. Ligand binding in cis increases tyrosine phosphorylation and SHP-1 recruitment to CD22. Possible ligands in cis are sialylated membrane-bound IgM (a), and CD45 (b). CD45 is known to activate Lyn, the tyrosine kinase responsible for phosphorylation of CD22. Trans interactions may be important, if the BCR binds to self antigens on other cells. In this case additional CD22 could be recruited into cellular contact zone (c), resulting in a stronger inhibition of the BCR signal.

phosphorylation of CD72 and, therefore, recruitment of SHP-1 [36]. In B cells from CD100-deficient mice, CD72 is constitutively phosphorylated [38]. These results suggest that CD100 positively regulates B-cell activation by preventing signal inhibition by CD72. Mechanistically, CD100 might disturb CD72–BCR association (Figure 3).

Function of the inhibitory protein PIR-B on B cells

Mice express the paired immunoglobulin-like receptors (PIRs) PIR-A and PIR-B, which are proposed to be orthologues of the human leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptors (LILRs or LIRs; also called immunoglobulin-like transcript [ILT] or myeloid immunoglobulin-like receptors [MIRs]) on the basis of structural similarity, similar expression profiles and genomic location. PIR-A and PIR-B are expressed on myeloid cells and B cells. Whereas PIR-A is a protein family encoded by multiple genes, PIR-B is encoded by a single gene [39]. PIR-A delivers activation signals by binding to the Fc receptor common γ chain, which is also required for its expression. PIR-B, by contrast, contains three ITIM motifs on its cytoplasmic tail and is an inhibitory receptor [40]. PIR-B

Mechanisms of inhibition by PIR-B, CD72 and FcγRIIB. PIR-B is constitutively tyrosine phosphorylated and binds SHP-1. It can inhibit BCR signalling after crosslinking to the BCR. PIR-B binds to various MHC class I molecules. After BCR crosslinking, CD72 is tyrosine phosphorylated and recruits SHP-1. CD100 binding to CD72 reduces tyrosine phosphorylation and inhibition of CD72, maybe by interfering with its interaction to the BCR. The FcγRIIB receptor is recruited via IgG immune complexes to IgM. In this case, SHIP binds to the FcγRIIB tail and inhibits sustained Ca²⁺ signalling by catalysing dephosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5) triphosphate (PIP3) into phosphatidylinositol (3,4) bisphosphate (PIP2). Abbreviations: IP3, inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate; IP3R, IP3 receptor.

is constitutively phosphorylated in B cells and, similar to CD22 and CD72, recruits SHP-1 [41]. When PIR-B is crosslinked to the BCR it can inhibit BCR-triggered Ca²⁺ responses [39]. Although direct association to the BCR has not been demonstrated, PIR-B ligation can inhibit BCR-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Igα, Igβ, Syk, Btk and PLCγ2 [42]. PIR-B-deficient mice show increased B-cell proliferation upon anti-IgM stimulation, and augmented Th2 immune responses after immunisation with thymus-dependent antigens [43]. Both PIR-A and PIR-B, which have very similar extracellular domains, recognize various MHC class I molecules [44,45]. After the transfer of allogeneic splenocytes into PIR-B-deficient mice, the mice show exacerbated graft-versus-host disease due to augmented activation of recipient DCs [44**]. This is the first demonstration of a functional role for the interaction of PIR-B with MHC class I molecules (Figure 3).

Inhibition of B cell signalling by FcγRIIB

IgG immune complexes were recognized as potent inhibitory ligands for B cells a long time ago. The low-affinity IgG receptor FcγRIIB, the only IgG Fc receptor expressed on B cells, carries a cytoplasmic ITIM motif and is inhibitory. IgG immune complexes can co-ligate the FcγRIIB to the BCR. This co-ligation leads to inhibition of BCR-induced Ca²⁺ signals and cellular proliferation [46]. Phosphorylation of the FcγRIIB ITIM motif is required for the inhibition, and inhibition depends on binding of the inositol phosphatase SHIP [47].

Current Opinion in Immunology 2005, 17:290–297 www.sciencedirect.com
Recently, it was shown that a second tyrosine-containing motif in the cytoplasmic domain of FcγRIIB, which is bound by the adaptors Grb2 and Grap, is also required for efficient SHIP recruitment [48]. From several studies using genetically modified mice and cell lines it is evident that FcγRIIB does not constitutively inhibit mIg signaling by activation of SHIP, but rather requires co-ligation by immune complexes [49,50]. The inhibition of Ca²⁺ signals by SHIP is caused by lipid phosphatase activity hydrolysing phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5) triphosphate (PIP3), resulting in dissociation of essential pleckstrin-homology domain-containing proteins, such as Btk, PLCγ2 and Vav from the membrane (Figure 3). Inhibition of cellular proliferation by FcγRIIB involves binding of the adaptor protein Dok-1 to SHIP and subsequent inactivation of the Ras pathways [51]. FcγRIIB signalling also activates the ERK MAPK Pac-1 and the 3′-inositol phosphatase PTEN, which might also contribute to inhibition of proliferation [52]. The *in vivo* relevance of inhibition signalling by FcγRIIB was demonstrated in FcγRIIB-deficient mice. FcγRIIB⁻/⁻ mice have enhanced antibody responses, are hypersensitive to collagen-induced arthritis, have spontaneous anti-DNA antibodies and rheumatoid factors, and develop systemic lupus erythematosus in the C57BL/6 background [53–56].

When ligated separately from the BCR, FcγRIIB can induce an apoptotic response. This signal is not only independent of SHIP but also increases when SHIP, or the binding site for SHIP, is deleted [57]. Apoptosis is also induced by crosslinking FcγRIIB in pre-B cells, which do not have a BCR [58]. Thus, FcγRIIB seems to have a dual role depending on whether or not it is co-ligated to the BCR. These two types of signals might be crucial in germinal centre B-cell selection when follicular DCs display immune complexes to either cognate or non-cognate B cells.

### Conclusions

In summary, B cells constitutively express a set of inhibitory co-receptors, which are regulated by surprisingly different mechanisms. Generally, inhibition relies on the presence of ITIM motifs and on recruitment of either SHP-1 or SHIP to this motif. The phosphorylation of ITIMs on inhibitory co-receptors depends on their association with the BCR, either constitutively or induced, as has been shown for CD22 and FcγRIIB. This direct association still needs to be demonstrated for CD72 and PIR-B. An important regulation of the inhibitory receptors seems to be achieved by ligand binding, which can switch on inhibition (FcγRII), enhance inhibition (CD22) or even turn off inhibition (CD72). These different strategies enable the B cell to tightly control the strength of the BCR signal in response to the microenvironment.

In the future it will be important to elucidate the exact mechanisms of ligand binding of inhibitory co-receptors,

because details of these mechanisms are still not clear. Also, additional inhibitory receptors expressed on the B cell surface may be added to the list, such as new members of the Siglec family or Fc receptor relatives (see also Update).

#### Update

Interesting recent work showed that restoration of FcγRIIB levels in lupus-prone mouse strains, which have naturally diminished levels, is sufficient to prevent autoimmunity [59]. Also, a new family of Fc receptor relatives, which is expressed on B cells, has been characterized in human and mouse [60].

The authors show that antigenic B-cell stimulation results in efficient phosphorylation of inhibitory receptors CD72 and CD22, which is not the case when B cells are stimulated with anti-Ig antibodies. Both types of stimulation protocols lead to different B-cell fates, which is a new finding.
