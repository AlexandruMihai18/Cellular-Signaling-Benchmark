**Abstract** The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is one of the best-studied enzyme-neuropeptide systems in the brain and can serve as a model for the action of peptides on neuronal function in general. It is now well established that the brain has its own intrinsic RAS with all its components present in the central nervous system. The RAS generates a family of bioactive angiotensin peptides with variable biological and neurobiological activities. These include angiotensin-(1–8) [Ang II], angiotensin-(3–8) [Ang IV], and angiotensin-(1–7) [Ang-(1–7)]. These neuroactive forms of angiotensin act through specific receptors. Only Ang II acts through two different high-specific receptors, termed AT1 and AT2. Neuronal AT1 receptors mediate the stimulatory actions of Ang II on blood pressure, water and salt intake, and the secretion of vasopressin. In contrast, neuronal AT2 receptors have been implicated in the stimulation of apoptosis and as being antagonistic to AT1 receptors. Among the many potential effects mediated by stimulation of AT2 are neuronal regeneration after injury and the inhibition of pathological growth. Ang-(1–7) mediates its antihypertensive effects by stimulating the synthesis and release of vasodilator prostaglandins and nitric oxide and by potentiating the hypotensive effects of bradykinin. New data concerning the roles of Ang IV and Ang-(1–7) in cognition also support the existence of complex site-specific interactions between multiple angiotensins and multiple receptors in the mediation of important central functions of the RAS. Thus, the RAS of the brain is involved not only in the regulation of blood pressure, but also in the modulation of multiple additional functions in the brain, including processes of sensory information, learning, and memory, and the regulation of emotional responses.

**Introduction**

Neuropeptides belong to the class of neuromodulators. Compared with neurotransmitter synthesis, the synthesis of neuropeptides requires complex metabolic pathways including proteolytic processing from pre-neuropeptides to smaller pro-neuropeptides and to the final mature neuropeptides. In several instances, the common precursor can give rise to different biologically active neuropeptides. Proopiomelanocortin, for example, is a precursor for many different neuropeptides, including adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), melanocyte-stimulating hormone, and beta-endorphin. Another example of the generation of a variety of biologically active neuropeptides from one common precursor is the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) of the brain.

One of the first substances shown to exert physiological effects was renin. More than a century ago, Tigerstedt and Bergman (1898) discovered that injection of renal extracts exerted profound effects on blood pressure. Accordingly, this extract was called renin. Later, the active substrate, renin, was found to be a specific protease representing the key enzyme for angiotensin production. The physiologically active octapeptide angiotensin II (Ang II), a product of the catalytic action of renin, was isolated by two groups more than 60 years ago (Braun-Menendez et al. 1940; Page and Helmer 1940). About 20 years later, intraventricular injection of Ang II was found to induce a centrally mediated pressor response (Bickerton and Buckley 1961), indicating that Ang II was a neuroactive peptide acting in

the brain. Since Ang II does not readily cross the blood-brain barrier, brain Ang II is unlikely to originate from the peripheral renin-angiotensin-system (RAS; Harding et al. 1988; van Houten et al. 1983). Indeed, a complete brain RAS exists that is distinctly separate from the peripheral system and comprises all necessary precursors and enzymes required for the formation and metabolism of the biologically active forms of angiotensin (Wright and Harding 1994).

Nevertheless, the brain RAS is not completely independent from the peripheral system, since angiotensin generated at the periphery can interact with the brain RAS at specific brain sites: the circumventricular organs (CVOs, specific sites in the central nervous system but lacking the normal blood-brain barrier). These CVOs are critically involved in the regulation of many homeostatic processes, including the control of cardiovascular functions, hydromineral balance, body temperature, and hormone secretion (Pan 2004). The actions of peripherally generated angiotensins at these sites are thought to influence classical behavioral (drinking), endocrine (vasopressin, oxytocin, and ACTH secretion), and autonomic functions (Ferguson et al. 1999, 2001).

Central actions of angiotensins are not exclusively associated with their traditional roles. Indeed, several studies have shown that central angiotensins are also involved in sexual behavior, stress, learning, and memory.

### Biosynthesis of neuroactive angiotensins

Ang II is generated from the precursor angiotensinogen, which is cleaved by renin to form the decapeptide angiotensin I. By the activity of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), angiotensin I is hydrolyzed at its carboxyterminus. This leads to the generation of the octapeptide Ang II. Ang II seemed to represent the first neuroactive form of the angiotensins (Johnston 1990) and is not only generated in the brain via this classical pathway, involving

The above precursors and enzymes required for the formation of the biologically active forms of angiotensins have been localized in brain tissues. The distribution pattern of cells expressing the various components of the brain RAS has been reviewed in detail elsewhere (McKinley et al. 2003; von Bohlen und Halbach 2005; Wright and Harding 1995). Since angiotensinogen and angiotensins I and II do not readily cross the blood-brain barrier (Harding et al. 1988; Printz 1988; van Houten et al. 1983), these substances are unlikely to originate from the peripheral RAS suggesting the existence of an independent RAS within the brain. However, not a single brain cell hasbeen detected so far that expresses all components of the RAS. Even at the regional level, there is a mismatch in the distribution of the members of the brain RAS. Some of them are widespread in the brain, whereas others have a more restricted distribution (Davisson 2003). Together, these findings suggest that the formation of bioactive forms of angiotensin might require multiple cell interactions. A further hypothesis is that the brain possesses alternative enzymatic mechanisms for the formation of the neuroactive forms of angiotensin that are distinct from those involved in the classical renin-angiotensin pathway (Saavedra 2005). If the latter is true, renin might not only be required for the generation of neuroactive compounds of the brain RAS, raising the question of a further role of renin in the brain.

Indeed, recent data indicate that renin and its precursor prorenin also possess biological activity and that binding of prorenin/renin is able to generate receptor-mediated intracellular signaling cascades. In 2002, a receptor was cloned that showed renin- and prorenin-specific binding (Nguyen et al. 2002). This receptor is composed of 350 amino acids, forms a single transmembrane domain, and displays no apparent homology with any known membrane protein. The binding of renin to this receptor induces a four-fold increase of the catalytic efficiency of angiotensinogen conversion to angiotensin I (Nguyen et al. 2002). Furthermore, activation of this receptor mediates intracellular signaling by activating mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases: extracellular signal regulated kinases ERK1 and ERK2 (Nguyen et al. 2003). In addition to the high levels of prorenin/renin receptor mRNA in heart and placenta, substantial levels have also been detected within the brain (Nguyen et al. 2002) suggesting a physiological role of the prorenin/renin receptor in the central nervous system (CNS).

A unique silent mutation in the renin receptor gene (ATP6AP2) present in patients with X-linked mental retardation and epilepsy is reported to result in inefficient inclusion of exon IV in 50% of renin receptor mRNA (Ramser et al. 2005). Analysis of the membrane-associated-receptor molecular forms has revealed the presence of full-length and truncated proteins in these patients. Functional analysis has demonstrated that the mutated receptor can bind renin and increase renin catalytic activity, similar to the wild-type receptor, but results in a modest and reproducible impairment of ERK1/2 activation (Ramser et al. 2005). These findings show that even renin, acting through a specific receptor, is involved in cognitive functions and that disturbances in the prorenin/renin receptor might also play a crucial role in epilepsy.

### Distribution of angiotensin receptors in the brain

At the end of the 1980s, AT1 and AT2 angiotensin receptors that bound Ang II with equal potency were identified, and their specific antagonists were developed. AT1 receptors are, for example, expressed in brain areas regulating autonomic and hormonal responses. AT1 receptors are heterogeneously regulated in a number of experimental conditions. In specific areas, AT1 receptors are not normally expressed, since they are induced under the influence of reproductive hormones in dopaminergic neurons (Saavedra 1999). In contrast to the AT1 receptor, AT2 receptors are expressed at low density in adult brain but are up-regulated under pathological conditions. AT4 receptors have more recently been identified as being identical with insulin-regulated aminopeptidase (Albiston et al. 2001). Therefore, the angiotensin AT4 ligand (Ang IV) is also a potent competitive inhibitor of the insulin-regulated aminopeptidase (Lew et al. 2003).

CVOs have a reduced blood-brain-barrier because of the presence of fenestrated capillaries and are thought to represent the interface between the RASs of the periphery of the body and the CNS. Indeed, the CVOs, including the anterior pituitary gland, area postrema, median eminence, organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis, and the subfornical organ possess Ang-II-binding sites (Landas et al. 1980; Phillips 1987). However, binding sites were not restricted to these organs, since the AT1, AT2, and AT4 receptors have also been identified in a variety of other brain structures in various species, including guinea pig, mouse, rat, dog, monkey, and humans (Table 1; reviewed in detail in Gard 2002; von Bohlen und Halbach 2005; Wright and Harding 1995, 1997). Apparently, the distribution of AT1 receptors (Table 1) is highly conserved across mammalian species, and in many brain areas, there is a considerable overlap of the distribution of AT1 and AT2 receptor. In certain areas, such as the cortex, AT2 receptors are almost absent (Table 1). However, high densities of Ang-IV-binding sites can be found both in the cortex and in other brain areas associated with memory function (e.g., hippocampus and amygdala; Table 1).

### Angiotensin II

#### Angiotensin II and synaptic transmission

The physiological actions of Ang II in the brain, mediated by AT1 or AT2 receptors, involve modulations in neuronal activity that are initiated by changes in the activity of membrane ionic currents and channels. These changes have been reviewed in detail by Pan (2004) in relation to structures relevant to blood pressure regulation, e.g., the nucleus of the solitary tract, the locus coeruleus, and the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus. In addition, we and others have shown that Ang II mainly increases firing rates in the visual and somatosensory thalamus (Albrecht et al. 1997b,c) and the superior colliculus (Mooney et al. 1994), suggesting that Ang II has a role in information processing. Furthermore, the Ang-II-induced neuronal excitation in the inferior olivary nucleus, which is blocked specifically by AT2 receptor antagonists, indicates an involvement in motor control (Ambuhl et al. 1992). The activity-enhancing effect of Ang II in the hippocampus (Albrecht et al. 1997a; Haas et al. 1980) and the amygdala (Figs. 2a, 3a) (Albrecht et al. 2000) is paralleled by Ang-II-induced behavioral

Angiotensin II and behavior

Behavioral data obtained from rats have been difficult to interpret because of the diverse methodological approaches. Major differences can be attributed to the variety of application routes, i.e., intracerebroventricular vs. directly into brain parenchyma. For example, when Ang II is injected directly into the dorsal neostriatum (Morgan and Routtenberg 1977), retention of a step-down shock avoidance response is impaired, whereas retrieval in a similar passive avoidance conditioning task improves

AT1 receptors

AT1 receptors have been cloned and their amino acid sequence determined from the respective cDNAs (Murphy et al. 1991; Sasaki et al. 1991). The human AT1 gene is located on chromosome 3q and codes for a protein of 40–42 kDa (359 amino acids). Most species express a single autosomal AT1 gene, but two related AT1A and AT1B receptor genes are expressed in rodents. These two receptors are 95% identical in their amino acid sequences. They also seem to be similar in terms of ligand binding and activation but differ in their tissue distribution, chromosomal localization, and transcriptional regulation (de Gasparo et al. 2000; Inagami et al. 1994; Iwai and Inagami 1992). In contrast to AT2 receptors (Csikos et al. 1998; Dudley et al. 1991), agonist-occupied AT1 receptors undergo desensitization and internalization in the same manner as many other G-protein-coupled receptors (de Gasparo et al. 2000). The serine/threonine-rich region, including Leu37 in the cytoplasmic tail of the AT1 receptor, seems to be necessary for endocytosis of the agonist-receptor complex (Hunyady et al. 1994). Both AT1A and AT1B receptors are internalized after agonist stimulation by a protein kinase C (PKC)-independent mechanism (Sasamura et al. 1997).

Signal transduction and functional consequences

Neuronal AT1 receptors mediate the stimulatory actions of Ang II on blood pressure, water and salt intake, and secretion of vasopressin. Administration of Ang II into the rodent brain has been shown to induce drinking behavior (Epstein et al. 1969, 1970; Jones 1986; Jones and Mogenson 1982; Sumners et al. 1981), an effect predominantly mediated by AT1 receptors. At the behavioral level, Ang II induction of water and salt intake has been well studied (for reviews, see Daniels and Fluharty 2004; Fitzsimons 1998). The increases in water and sodium intake resulting from Ang II are initiated largely through stimulation of the AT1 receptor in forebrain CVOs, including the organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis and the subfornical organ.

Blockade of the brain AT1 receptors not only contributes to a significant blood pressure decrease in hypertension; the simultaneous antagonism of peripheral and brain AT1 receptors also reduces the sympathoadrenal and hormonal responses to stress and prevents stress-induced gastric injury (Armando et al. 2003). A further prominent property of Ang II is its AT1-mediated effect on cerebral blood vessels. Application of Ang II results in vasoconstriction of cerebral arterioles (Naveri 1995).

AT1 receptors form heterodimers with the AT2 and bradykinin B2 receptors, and cross talk between AT1 and epidermal growth factor receptors has been described (Campbell 2003).

Studies on AT1-receptor-mediated signal transduction pathways have shown that Ang-II-induced signals vary from seconds to minutes and even to hours. This can easily be explained by the activation of distinctly complex signaling pathways, e.g., the phospholipase C (PLC) pathway (seconds), MAP kinase activation (minutes), and, for example, activation of Janus kinase and of signal transducers and activators of transcription pathways (hours; Guo et al. 2001; Richards et al. 1999; Sumners et al. 2002). In light of increasing evidence that AT1 receptors employ multiple signaling pathways, the divergent signaling pathways used by the AT1 receptor may have different roles in the array of behaviors induced by Ang II. Recent data suggest that the PLC/PKC/inositol triphosphate pathway is required for water intake but not for NaCl consumption stimulated by Ang II (Daniels et al. 2005). Thus, divergent intracellular signals from a single receptor type can give rise to separable behavioral phenomena.

Norepinephrine-mediated neuromodulation involves AT1-receptor-mediated losartan-dependent rapid norepinephrine release, inhibition of K+ channels, and stimulation of Ca2+ channels. AT1-receptor-mediated enhancement of
norepinephrine neuromodulation involves the Ras-Raf-MAP kinase cascade and ultimately leads to an increase in norepinephrine transporter expression and tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine beta-hydroxylase mRNA transcription (Gelband et al. 1998). Ang II not only modulates norepinephrine release, but also regulates the synthesis and release of serotonin in the brain (Nahmod et al. 1978). In addition, angiotensin has been shown to be involved in the regulation of adrenocortical hormones, e.g., by modulating the release of ACTH (Ferguson et al. 1999) and the levels of glucocorticoids and corticotropin-releasing hormone mRNA (Sumitomo et al. 1991). In primary cultures from hypothalamus and brain stem areas, Ang II increases the neuronal firing rate, an effect mediated by the AT1 receptor subtype and involving inhibition of the delayed rectifier potassium current. This increase in neuronal activity is associated with increases in NADPH oxidase activity and reactive oxygen species levels within neurons (Sun et al. 2005). AT1 receptors located pre- and postsynaptically have been shown to influence norepinephrinergic, GABAergic, and/or glutamatergic transmission (Barnes et al. 2003; Dendorfer et al. 1998; Oz et al. 2005; Ozaki et al. 2004). For example, Ang II excites spinally projecting neurons in the paraventricular nucleus by attenuation of GABAergic synaptic inputs through activation of presynaptic AT1 receptors (Li et al. 2003).

**AT1-deficient mice**

Mice lacking functional Ang II receptor subtypes ($\text{Agtr}1_{A}^{(-/-)}$) were generated about 10 years ago (Sugaya et al. 1995). $\text{Agtr}1_{A}^{(-/-)}$ mice grow and develop normally but show severely blunted vascular responses to Ang II. Blood pressure is reduced by more than 20 mm Hg, confirming the important role for this gene locus in mediating vascular responses to Ang II and in maintaining blood pressure (Coffman 1997). Of note, the magnitude and time-dependent pattern of $[\text{Ca}^{2+}]_{i}$ changes produced by Ang II are similar in cells that lack AT1$_{A}$ receptors but possess AT1$_{B}$ receptors (Zhu et al. 1998). Although dehydration produces increased plasma vasopressin and an increase in AT1 receptors in the paraventricular nucleus and anterior pituitary in wildtype mice, no effect of dehydration is obvious in AT1$_{A}$-deficient mice (Morris et al. 1999). Studies in knockout mice have also indicated that the central effect of Ang II on alcohol consumption is mediated by AT1 receptors, whereas AT2 receptors and the bradykinin B2 receptors are not involved (Maul et al. 2005). These data support earlier reports that losartan can effectively block some of the intoxicating effects of low doses of ethanol (Wayner et al. 1994). The interaction of Ang II with the dopaminergic system also seems to be mediated mainly by AT1 receptors (Tchekalarova and Georgiev 1998).

Recently, the role of central Ang II in alcohol intake has been characterized by using transgenic rats that express an antisense RNA against angiotensinogen and, consequently, have reduced Ang II levels exclusively in the CNS [TGR (ASrAOGEN) 680]. These rats consume markedly less alcohol in comparison with their wild-type controls. Further studies in these mice have indicated that the central effect of Ang II on alcohol consumption is mediated by the angiotensin receptor AT1. Moreover, the dopamine concentration in the ventral tegmental area is markedly reduced, strengthening the hypothesis of a role for dopaminergic transmission in Ang-II-controlled alcohol preference (Maul et al. 2005).

AT1 receptors and long-term potentiation

Long-term potentiation (LTP), a specific form of synaptic plasticity, is thought to represent a correlate of processes attributable to learning and memory and has been extensively studied in terms of both its underlying mechanisms and its behavioral significance. Injection of Ang II just above the CA1 field in intact urethane-anesthetized rats has been shown to block the induction of LTP in perforant path-stimulated dentate granule cells (Denny et al. 1991). Further experiments have demonstrated that this inhibition can be blocked by the administration of AT1-receptor antagonists (Wayner et al. 1993a,b). These results have been confirmed in a study with an in-vitro hippocampal slice preparation (Armstrong et al. 1996). Similarly, using brain slices, we have shown that Ang II induces an AT1-mediated inhibition of high-frequency stimulation (HFS)-induced LTP in the lateral nucleus of the amygdala (von Bohlen und Halbach and Albrecht 1998). Theta-burst stimulation (TBS)-induced LTP in the same nucleus is also suppressed by Ang II (Albrecht et al. 2003). The suppressive effect of Ang II, however, has not been shown in AT1$_{A}$-deficient mice (unpublished observation). As shown in Fig. 3b, we have demonstrated an inhibitory action of Ang II on N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-induced excitation of neurons in the lateral nucleus of the amygdala (Albrecht et al. 2003). Since TBS-induced and HFS-induced LTP in the lateral nucleus of the amygdala is NMDA-dependent (Bauer et al. 2002; Drephal et al. 2006; Huang and Kandel 1998), the suppressive effect of Ang II on LTP might be mediated either by the presynaptic action of Ang II on glutamatergic terminals or by an interaction with postsynaptic NMDA receptors. Our preliminary results indicate that this interaction of Ang II with glutamatergic transmission is not mediated presynaptically, since paired pulse facilitation of NMDA-EPSCs in neurons of the lateral amygdala is not influenced by Ang II (Fig. 2b).

Furthermore, Wayner et al. (1993a) have discovered that ethanol-induced inhibition of hippocampal LTP is mediated by the AT1 receptor, perhaps via hypothalamicprojections to the hippocampus (Wayner et al. 1997). These results are also consistent with an interaction of NMDA receptors and Ang II.

### AT2 receptors

AT2 receptors have been cloned by two groups (Kambayashi et al. 1993; Mukoyama et al. 1993). The AT2 site shares a homology of 32%–34% with the AT1 receptor and represents a protein of 363 amino acids with seven hydrophobic transmembrane domains (Kambayashi et al. 1993; Nakajima et al. 1993). The human AT2 gene is located on the X chromosome (Gard 2002). The open reading frame of the AT2 cDNA encodes 363 amino acids in humans, mice, and rats. A 99% sequence identity exists between rat and mouse and a 72% identity between rat and human (de Gasparo et al. 2000). In contrast to the AT1 receptors, agonist binding to AT2 receptors does not induce receptor internalization. The AT2 receptor shares several common features of the seven-transmembrane family of receptors; even so, it represents a distant member of this group (Wright and Harding 2004).

of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors in the mediation of Ang-II-induced effects on neuronal activity has also been shown in these experiments. In accordance with our data, behavioral experiments have demonstrated that the GABAergic system exerts an inhibitory control on pathways mediating the stimulatory effects of Ang II (Georgiev et al. 1991; Yonkov et al. 1987). Recently, Braszko (2002) has reported that inhibition of the AT2 receptor with PD123319 abolishes the Ang-II-induced acquisition of conditioned avoidance responses (Braszko 2002).

The AT2-receptor-mediated increase in neuronal firing rate seems to involve the generation of lipoxygenase metabolites of arachidonic acid and the activation of serine/threonine phosphatase type 2A (Zhu et al. 2001). With regard to AT2 receptor expression, exposure of Ang II has been shown to up-regulate AT2 receptor mRNA levels in rat cortical cells (Shibata et al. 1997). This study has also suggested that induction of AT2 receptor mRNA expression by Ang II in cortical neurons is regulated by the activity of serine/threonine phosphatases. Together, these investigations support the hypothesis that, in addition to a role during development, the AT2 receptor may also be involved in cognitive processes in the adult.

### Signal transduction and functional consequences

The function of AT2 receptors remains elusive and controversial. AT2 receptors are known not only to regulate several functions of neurons, e.g., ionic fluxes, cell differentiation, and axonal regeneration, but also to modulate programmed cell death (reviewed in detail in de Gasparo and Siragy 1999; Gallinat et al. 2000; Gendron et al. 2003; Stoll and Unger 2001). One effect of the AT2 receptor is to promote axonal regeneration after nerve crush (Lucius et al. 1998). Activation of AT2 receptor results in growth inhibition and promotion of apoptosis associated with the inhibition of MAP kinases, such as extracellular-regulated kinases, probably by the activation of phosphotyrosine phosphatases (Schmitz and Berk 1997).

Most neuronal AT2 receptors signal via G<sub>i</sub> proteins (Gelband et al. 1998; Kang et al. 1995). However, evidence also exists showing that AT2 receptors can couple via a G-protein-independent mechanism (Gallinat et al. 2000). In neurons co-cultured from neonate rat hypothalamus and brain stem, the stimulation of both transient K<sup>+</sup> current (I<sub>A</sub>) and delayed-rectifier K<sup>+</sup> current (I<sub>K</sub>) via Ang II is mediated by AT2 receptors (Kang et al. 1993). Although AT2 receptor activation does not affect voltage-dependent calcium currents in cultured neurons (Kang et al. 1993), it does result in the inhibition of T-type calcium currents in NG108-15 cells (Buisson et al. 1995). Physiologically, AT2-induced activation of potassium currents is associated with a reduction in the length of action potentials and with a shortening of the refractory period, both of which lead to an increase in membrane excitability (Gendron et al. 2003). We have found AT2-mediated increases in the firing rate in the sensory thalamus (Albrecht et al. 1997b,c) and in the amygdala (Albrecht et al. 2000). However, an involvement

### AT2-deficient mice

Although AT2-deficient mice (Agtr2<sup>(−/y)</sup>) develop normally, we have shown that cell densities in the cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, and thalamus are higher in adult AT2-deficient in comparison with wildtype mice (von Bohlen und Halbach et al. 2001). Based on the established and postulated roles of AT2 receptors, the increase in cell density may therefore result from impaired growth arrest, diminished apoptosis, and/or impaired cell migration (Gendron et al. 2003). In addition, AT2-deficient mice have an impaired drinking response to water deprivation and suffer from perturbations in exploratory behavior and locomotor activity (Hein et al. 1995; Ichiki et al. 1995). AT2-deficient mice have increased sensitivity to pain and decreased levels of brain beta-endorphin (Sakagawa et al. 2000). AT2 receptor disruption also induces alterations of other regulatory systems, including altered arachidonic acid metabolism (Gross et al. 2000). Moreover, AT2-deficient mice show lowered body temperature (Watanabe et al. 1999). Their baseline blood pressure is normal, but the vasopressor response to Ang II is augmented. The hypersensitivity to pressor and antinatriuretic effects of Ang II in vivo (Brede and Hein 2001) in AT2-deficient mice supports the results of several investigations indicating that the AT2 receptor subtype counteracts some of the biological effects of AT1 receptor signaling. Studies in AT2-deficient mice have also demonstrated that AT2 functions include the tonic decrease of ACE activity (Hunley et al. 2000). However, the increased vascular reactivity in these knockout mice is at least partly attributable to the increased expression of vascular AT1 receptors (Tanaka et al. 1999). Okuyama et al. (1999) have shown that AT2-knockout mice display anxiety-like be-
behavior, and that the numbers of \[^{3}H\]prazosin-binding but not \[^{125}I\]CRF-binding sites in the amygdala are significantly reduced in AT2-deficient mice. This indicates that the norepinephrergic system is involved in mediating the anxiety-like behavior in AT2-deficient mice, and that the amygdala is involved in the mediation of these effects.

### Angiotensin IV

Ang IV is known to induce physiological effects, but these effects are distinct from those elicited by Ang II. Since the AT1 and AT2 receptors bind Ang IV with low affinity only, a specific binding site for Ang IV might exist. Indeed, a binding site that preferentially binds Ang IV has been identified in bovine adrenal membranes (Jarvis et al. 1992; Swanson et al. 1992) and on vascular smooth muscle (Hall et al. 1993). This binding site is distinct from the AT1 and AT2 receptors based on the inability of Ang II or specific AT1 and AT2 receptor antagonists to bind to the site with high affinity (Harding et al. 1992; Swanson et al. 1992). Moreover, radioactively labeled Ang IV has been shown to bind to the site reversibly, with high affinity, and with a \(K_{D}\) of about 1 nM (Swanson et al. 1992). The Ang-IV-binding site is termed AT4 (de Gasparo et al. 2000).

---

### AT4 receptors

AT4 receptors are known to be identical to insulin-regulated aminopeptidase (Albiston et al. 2001). Therefore, the angiotensin AT4 ligand (Ang IV) is also a potent competitive inhibitor of insulin-regulated aminopeptidase by binding to its catalytic site (Lew et al. 2003). In contrast to the known Ang II receptors AT1 and AT2, the AT4 receptor is apparently not linked to G-proteins (Hall et al. 1993; Hanesworth et al. 1993; Miller Wing et al. 1993). In addition to Ang IV, hemorphins, a class of endogenous peptides obtained by the hydrolysis of the beta-chain of hemoglobin, can also interact with the AT4 receptor (Lee et al. 2003; Moeller et al. 1997, 1998, 1999). Thus, hemorphins might act as endogenous competitors of Ang IV (Garreau et al. 1998).

Signal transduction and functional consequences

Given the short half-life of native Ang IV, several laboratories have tested the high-affinity and metabolically more stable Ang IV analog Norleucine\(^1\)-Ang IV (Sardinia et al. 1994). This analog enhances synaptic transmission in the hippocampal CA1 region of brain slices (Kramar et al. 2001). Moreover, iontophoretically ejected native Ang IV enhances the firing rates of most neurons in the hippocampal area CA3 and the gyrus dentate in urethane-anesthetized rats (Albrecht et al. 1997a). Similar data have been obtained in the visual thalamus (Albrecht et al. 1997b) and in various nuclei of the amygdala, as shown in Fig. 4 (Albrecht and Nitschke 1998).

A significant body of literature suggests that AT4 ligands activate a number of intracellular second messenger systems. In porcine proximal tubular epithelial cells, Ang IV dose-dependently mediates tyrosine phosphorylation of both focal adhesion protein (p125-FAK) and paxillin (Chen et al. 2001). In HK-2 cells, Ang IV increases levels of phosphorylated MAP kinase and enhanced p38 kinase activity (Handa 2001). In the periphery, \(\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\) mobilization is not linked to Ang IV signaling, since Ang IV fails to influence phosphoinositol metabolism, although an increase in \([\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_{i}\) concentration has been identified through activation of voltage-sensitive \(\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\) channels (Dulin et al. 1995). Downstream targets seem to include immediate early genes, since intracerebroventricular infusion of Ang IV in brain areas associated with cognition induces c-fos expression (Hanesworth et al. 1993; Miller Wing et al. 1993; Roberts et al. 1995). AT4 activation also stimulates the expression and release of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), an effect that can be blocked by AT4 antagonists (Kerins et al. 1995; Mehta et al. 2002). In addition, Ang IV increases endothelial cell constitutive nitric oxide synthase activity and cellular cGMP content (Patel et al. 1998). For example, the Ang-IV-induced increment in cerebral blood flow is dependent upon the synthesis and release of nitric oxide from vascular endothelial cells (Kramar et al. 1998).

Angiotensin IV and LTP

Ang IV induces facilitation of LTP in hippocampal CA1 in vitro (Kramar et al. 2001), whereas perfusion with an AT4 antagonist disrupts LTP stabilization in area CA1 (Davis et al. 2006). In rat dentate gyrus, both Ang IV and Norleucine¹-Ang IV have been shown to cause an enhancement of LTP in vivo (Wayner et al. 2001). Moreover, ethanol-induced suppression of CA1 LTP can be attenuated with Norleucine¹-Ang IV (Wright et al. 2003). These data strongly support an inhibitory influence of Ang II and a facilitative role of Ang IV on LTP (Wright et al. 2002).

### Angiotensin IV and behavior

Braszko et al. (1988) have reported that intracerebroventricularly administered Ang IV stimulates exploratory locomotor behavior and improves recall in a passive avoidance situation. The improvement in the recall of passive avoidance responses is dose-dependent (Wright et al. 1993, 1995). Moreover, chronic intracerebroventricular infusion of Norleucine¹-Ang IV via osmotic pumps facilitates the rate of acquisition for solving a water maze task (Wright et al. 1999) suggesting that Ang IV plays a role in the hippocampus-dependent formation of spatial learning and memory. In addition, stimulation of AT4 receptors has been shown to attenuate learning deficits observed for scopolamine-treated animals in the passive avoidance task and in spatial learning (Albiston et al. 2004b; Pederson et al. 2001). Intracerebroventricular administration of the nAChR antagonist mecamylamine also interferes with spatial memory performance in rats similarly to the mAChR antagonist scopolamine. Interestingly, Norleucine-Ang IV attenuates mecamylamine-induced deficits in spatial memory (Olson et al. 2004). Therefore, cognitive facilitation by Ang IV could be attributable to the potentiation of cholinergic neurotransmission. This hypothesis is supported by the finding that Ang IV causes an increase in potassium-evoked [³H] acetylcholine release from hippocampal slices preincubated with [³H]choline (Lee et al. 2001). In addition to the cholinergic system, D1 dopamine receptors seem to be necessary for Ang-IV-mediated cognitive effects (Braszko 2004). Importantly, the effects of AT4 ligands might result, in part, from the inhibition of insulin-related aminopeptidase cleavage of various neuropeptides, such as vasopressin, oxytocin, and met-enkephalin (Lew et al. 2003), which are also involved in memory processing. Moreover, Ang IV and LVVH-7 are able to inhibit ACE activity. Thus, both peptides significantly decrease the conversion of Ang I to Ang II in vitro (Fruitier-Arnaudin et al. 2002).

### Angiotensin-(1–7)

Binding sites for angiotensin-(1–7)

Binding sites for this neuroactive angiotensin fragment in the brain have been proposed because Ang-(1–7) binds to a site distinct from AT1 and AT2 receptors (Rowe et al. 1995). However, since data concerning signaling and functions are rare, a name for the binding site has not been included in the current nomenclature of angiotensin receptors (de Gasparo et al. 2000).

Ang-(1–7) immunoreactivity has been discerned in paraventricular, supraoptic, and suprachiasmatic nuclei, the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, substantia innominata, median eminence, and neurohypophysis (Block et al. 1988). In extracts from rat hypothalamus, approximately equimolar amounts of Ang-(1–7), Ang-II, and angiotensin I have been detected (1.10, 1.18, and 1.45 pmol/g tissue, respectively). A similar profile has been observed in the medulla oblongata and amygdala, although the content of these three peptides is 40%–70% less than that seen in the hypothalamus (Chappell et al. 1989).

### The mas receptor

Several studies (Ferrario et al. 1991; Kohara et al. 1991; Santos and Campagnole-Santos 1994) have shaped the hypothesis that Ang-(1–7) acts through a specific receptor. Recently, a G-protein-coupled receptor, Mas, encoded by the Mas protooncogene, has been identified that might act as an endogenous Ang-(1–7) receptor (Santos et al. 2003). Santos et al. (2003) have reported that genetic deletion of the Mas protooncogene abolishes binding of Ang-(1–7) in mouse kidneys. They have further demonstrated that Mas-deficient mice completely lack the antidiuretic action of Ang-(1–7), and that the aortas of these animals have lost their normal Ang-(1–7)-induced relaxation response. Furthermore, Ang-(1–7) produces an NO-dependent vasodilator effect in the mouse aorta that is mediated by the G-protein-coupled receptor Mas (Lemos et al. 2005). The Mas protooncogene has been isolated, cloned, and characterized (Young et al. 1986). This gene codes for a G-protein-coupled receptor with seven transmembrane domains (Brown 1989). The Mas-gene product is expressed in cerebral endothelial cells (Kumar et al. 1996), in neuronal cells (Kumar et al. 1996), and in various peripheral tissues (Metzger et al. 1995). In the brain, its mRNA has been located in the hippocampus, dentate gyrus, piriform cortex, and amygdala (Bunnemann et al. 1990; Martin et al. 1992; Metzger et al. 1995). Targeted disruption of the Mas protooncogene leads to an increased durability of LTP in the dentate gyrus, without affecting hippocampal morphology, basal synaptic transmission, or presynaptic function. The permissive influence of Mas deletion on hippocampal synaptic plasticity is paralleled by behavioral changes, such as anxiety (Walther et al. 1998, 2000). In addition, we have shown that cell numbers are not changed in the hippocampus of Mas-knockout mice
compared with their wild-type littermates, contrary to what we have found in AT1A-deficient and AT2-deficient mice (von Bohlen und Halbach et al. 2001). Therefore, the more robust LTP in the dentate gyrus (Walther et al. 1998) and in the CA1 region of the hippocampus in Mas-knockouts is unlikely to be attributable to morphological alterations.

### Signal transduction and functional consequences

Earlier studies had suggested tissue-specific processing of angiotensins, with Ang-(1–7) being a predominant angiotensin peptide in the CNS (Chappell et al. 1989). Although Ang-(1–7) is as potent as Ang II in stimulating the release of vasopressin from superfused hypothalamo-neurohypophysial explants, the heptapeptide has no dipsogenic or vasoconstrictor activity (Ferrario et al. 1990). Ang-(1–7) infusion significantly increases blood flow to the brain (Sampaio et al. 2003). Thus, Ang-(1–7), as a natural vasodilator hormone, may counterbalance the hemodynamic actions of Ang II (Feterik et al. 2000). Recent data suggest that the potentiation of the bradykinin-induced vasodilation by Ang-(1–7) is attributable to the release of nitric oxide and prostaglandins through an Ang-(1–7)-receptor-mediated mechanism (Almeida et al. 2000). Ang-(1–7) may also contribute to blood pressure regulation by blocking Ang II actions on norepinephrine release at the central level. This inhibitory effect is a nitric-oxide-mediated mechanism involving AT2 receptors and/or Ang-(1–7)-specific receptors and the local generation of bradykinin (Gironacci et al. 2004). In addition, Ang-(1–7) down-regulates the AT1 receptor, at least in vascular smooth muscle cells (Clark et al. 2001).

When considering the Mas receptor as one of the receptors for Ang-(1–7), it is important to note that Mas can hetero-oligomerize with the AT1 receptor and, by doing so, inhibit the actions of Ang II (Kostenis et al. 2005). This is a novel demonstration that a G-protein-coupled receptor acts as a physiological antagonist of a previously characterized receptor. These data also support our results obtained in the basolateral amygdala. We have analyzed whether field potentials are altered by Ang II in brain slices. Opposite actions of Ang II have been obtained in mice lacking the Mas protooncogene, in comparison with wildtype mice. The use of different angiotensin receptor antagonists have provided in-vitro evidence for a functional interaction between the Mas protooncogene and the AT1 receptor (von Bohlen und Halbach et al. 2000). Consequently, the AT1-Mas complex might be of great importance as a target for pharmacological intervention in cardiovascular diseases. Furthermore, in contrast to Ang II, Ang-(1–7) does not stimulate the release of inositol phosphates or prostacyclin in astrocytes (Tallant and Higson 1997), indicating that these different angiotensins may act through different signaling pathways. However, Ang-(1–7) competes 150-fold less effectively than native Ang II at AT1 predominant brain nuclei (Ki=2.4 μM; Rowe et al. 1995).

A few studies have shown that Ang-(1–7) increases the excitability of neurons, similar to the facilitatory action of Ang II on neuronal activity. For instance, Ang-(1–7) mimics the effects of Ang II in augmenting the intrinsic discharge rate of neurons within the vagal-solitary complex (Ferrario et al. 1990). Ang-(1–7)-induced excitation of paraventricular neurons (Felix et al. 1991) seems to be mediated by a distinct Ang-(1–7) receptor, because A779 is a selective antagonist of this receptor (Ambuhl et al. 1994). We have shown that Ang-(1–7) increases the excitability of neurons in the CA1 region of the hippocampus (Hellner et al. 2005). Moreover, we have demonstrated that Ang-(1–7) enhances hippocampal CA1 LTP induced by HFS and TBS in brain slices. This effect underscores the possibility that the G-protein-coupled receptor Mas, encoded by the Mas protooncogene, represents the physiological Ang-(1–7) receptor, since Mas-deficient mice do not show an Ang-(1–7)-induced enhancement of hippocampal LTP (Hellner et al. 2005).

The effects of Ang-(1–7) on behavior have not been examined in detail. Given that Mas encodes an Ang-(1–7) receptor, Ang-(1–7) may play a role in emotional behavior, since Mas-deficient mice display higher levels of anxiety (Walther et al. 1998).

### Angiotensins and neurological disorders

Orally administered AT1 receptor antagonists may hold promise as novel therapeutic compounds for the treatment of diseases of the CNS involving stress, inflammation, and ischemia (Saavedra 2005).

Despite biological support for a role of ACE in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), studies assessing the ACE insertion (I)/deletion (D) polymorphism in AD are conflicting (Savaskan 2005). A DNA polymorphism at the ACE gene seems to be associated with an increased risk of AD (Alvarez et al. 1999; Amouyel et al. 2000; Kolsch et al. 2005; Lehmann et al. 2005), although a lack of association between ACE polymorphism and sporadic AD has also been described (Monastero et al. 2002). Moreover, the ACE I/D polymorphism does not influence the extent of amyloid or tau pathologies in patients with sporadic AD (Lendon et al. 2002). However, ACE significantly degrades amyloid beta-peptide (Aβ) to inhibit the aggregation and cytotoxicity of Aβ (Hu et al. 2001; Oba et al. 2005). Therefore, ACE has been suggested to affect susceptibility to AD.

An association of an ACE gene polymorphism with mood disorders has also been postulated (Arinami et al. 1996). However, more recent studies have failed to support this hypothesis (Hong et al. 2002; Pauls et al. 2000; Segman et al. 2002). DeNoble et al. (1991) have reported that intracerebroventricular infusion of renin disrupts performance in a passive avoidance task and that co-administration of the ACE inhibitor captopril or of AT1 receptor antagonists (but not of AT2 receptor antagonists) attenuates this renin-induced deficit. Several ACE inhibitors are known to cross the blood-brain barrier. ACE inhibitors are described as facilitating mental functioning and well-being in human patients (Croog et al. 1986). Case
reports also suggest a captopril-induced mood-elevating effect in depressed patients (Deicken 1986; Zubenko and Nixon 1984). In healthy male subjects, single doses of captopril do not impair performance in a variety of tests but have been found to improve short-term memory (Currie et al. 1990). These studies support the notion that high arterial blood pressure is significantly associated with an impairment of cognition and the occurrence of depression with anxiety in humans. In a study with ACE antagonists, enalapril and, to a lesser extent, captopril have been found to reverse these deficits (Braszko et al. 2003a). Therefore, the use of antihypertensive drugs, particularly ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers, may be associated with a lower rate of cognitive decline in older adults, including those with AD (Gard and Rusted 2004; Hajjar et al. 2005). As reviewed in detail by Gard (2004), perturbation of the RAS improves basal cognition and reverses age-, scopolamine-, ethanol-, and diabetes-induced deficits. Moreover, recent data suggest that, in extremely elderly hypertensive patients, chronic AT1 receptor blockade by losartan can improve cognitive function, in particular immediate and delayed memory (Fogari et al. 2003).

Enhanced cognitive performance mediated by ACE inhibitors has been demonstrated in a number of animal models of memory function (Costall et al. 1989; Domeney 1994; Nikolova et al. 2000). For example, in active avoidance tasks, captopril improved learning in the second trial of the acquisition test and enhanced retention of memory when administered prior to training in mice (Raghavendra et al. 2001). In addition, ACE inhibition can improve both basal and impaired performance in animal models of learning (Barnes et al. 1992). These experiments have led to the hypothesis that the ability of ACE inhibitors to facilitate cognitive processes is related to reduced availability of Ang II (Domeney 1994), although a higher availability of Ang-(1–7) as shown by Tom et al. (2003) in ACE-inhibitor-treated patients might also underlie the improvement of cognition.

Central administration of Ang IV or LVV-hemorphin 7 not only markedly enhances learning and memory in normal rodents, but also reverses memory deficits observed in animal models of amnesia (Albiston et al. 2004a).

Treatment with ACE inhibitors, such as captopril, appears to improve cerebral blood flow and protects against damage induced by cerebral ischemia in normal (Werner et al. 1991) and hypertensive (Capdeville et al. 1990; Sadoshima et al. 1993) rats. Ang II regulates cerebral blood flow by stimulating cerebral vasoconstriction via AT1 receptors. Blockade of brain AT1 receptors has been shown to have neuroprotective effects in ischemic neuronal tissue and improves the neurological outcome of focal brain ischemia (Saavedra 2005; Thone-Reineke et al. 2004).

Concerning Parkinson’s disease and a possible linkage with polymorphisms in genes of the RAS, the results are as controversial as in the case of AD. Thus, an association between genetic polymorphism of the ACE gene and Parkinson’s disease has been found in Taiwan (Lin et al. 2002) but not in Australia (Mellick et al. 1999). However, decreased angiotensin-binding sites in the substantia nigra of postmortem brains from patients with Parkinson’s disease have been found (Allen et al. 1992). AT1 receptor levels are decreased by approximately 90% in the substantia nigra in patients with Parkinson’s disease relative to matched controls (Ge and Barnes 1996). Changes in AT1 receptor levels have not only been observed in cases of Parkinson’s disease, but also in Huntington’s disease in which AT1 receptor levels are decreased by approximately 30% in the putamen (Ge and Barnes 1996).

Recently, Vervoort et al. (2002) have published results showing that mutations in the *Agtr2* gene correlate with the development of human X-linked mental retardation.

### Perspectives

The identification of an independent RAS in the CNS demonstrates that angiotensins are involved in a variety of physiological processes. Aside from the classical functions of the angiotensin system in salt and water homeostasis and the regulation of blood pressure, this system in the CNS is also involved in the regulation of multiple brain functions, including processes of sensory information, learning, and memory plus the regulation of emotional responses. Moreover, evidence is increasing showing that the angiotensin system is also involved in several neurodegenerative diseases. However, further studies are required that determine the role of the various angiotensins and angiotensin receptors in many neuropathological states. Based on the enhanced cognitive performance mediated by ACE inhibitors capable of crossing the blood-brain barrier, manipulation of the CNS angiotensin system might be considered as a novel therapeutic target in the treatment of cognitive dysfunctions. For this purpose, a better understanding of the complex interactions between the various angiotensins and synaptic transmission is necessary and may lead to new therapeutic treatments with highly specific receptor agonists and/or antagonists.
