Core binding factors are heterodimeric transcription factors containing a DNA binding Runx1, Runx2, or Runx3 subunit, along with a non-DNA binding CBFβ subunit. All four subunits are required at one or more stages of hematopoiesis. This review describes the role of Runx1 and CBFβ in the initiation of hematopoiesis in the embryo, and in the emergence of hematopoietic stem cells. We also discuss the later stages of hematopoiesis for which members of the core binding factor family are required, as well as the recently described roles for these proteins in autoimmunity.

discuss their functions in initiating hematopoiesis in the embryo, maintaining hematopoiesis in the adult, and their association with autoimmunity and inflammation.

### Core-binding factors in the establishment of definitive hematopoiesis in the embryo

A number of studies have demonstrated the crucial roles of Runx1 and CBFβ in the generation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) during embryogenesis, while no data have implicated either Runx2 or Runx3 in this process (Okuda *et al.*, 1996; Sasaki *et al.*, 1996; Wang *et al.*, 1996a, b; Komori *et al.*, 1997; Otto *et al.*, 1997; Levanon *et al.*, 2002; Li *et al.*, 2002). Runx1- or Cbfβ-deficient embryos died between embryonic days (E) 12.5 and 13.5 with no (*Runx1⁻/⁻*) or very few (*Cbfβ⁻/⁻*) definitive hematopoietic progenitors in their fetal livers or yolk sacs, and no cells capable of engrafting adult mice upon transplantation (Okuda *et al.*, 1996; Sasaki *et al.*, 1996; Wang *et al.*, 1996a, b; Cai *et al.*, 2000). All of these data suggested a defect in the generation, migration (homing) or further differentiation of HSCs. It was thereafter shown that the defect resided in the emergence of definitive hematopoietic progenitors and stem cells (North *et al.*, 1999; Mukouyama *et al.*, 2000; Yokomizo *et al.*, 2001), which come from several distinct embryonic sites including the yolk sac, the para-aortic splanchnopleura (PAS) and its later developmental counterpart, the aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM) region, and the vitelline and umbilical arteries (Dzierzak *et al.*, 1998; Godin and Cumano, 2002 and references therein). Runx1 is expressed in all of these sites, and where examined (mouse, frog, fish) expression is conserved (Tracey *et al.*, 1998; North *et al.*, 1999; Ciau-Uitz *et al.*, 2000; Kataoka *et al.*, 2000; Burns *et al.*, 2002; Kalev-Zhylinska *et al.*, 2002). Cbfβ expression was found in the AGM region, but data were not reported for the other sites of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell emergence (Kundu *et al.*, 2002). Runx3 expression was clearly absent from the AGM region (Levanon *et al.*, 2001a), and no data have been reported for Runx2.

Runx1 is first expressed in the endoderm and mesoderm of the future yolk sac blood islands at the mid-late primitive streak stage (E7.25) of gestation (North *et al.*, 1999; Lacaud *et al.*, 2002). The location and timing of expression are similar to that of SCL (Silver and Palis, 1997; Elefanty *et al.*, 1999), and

suggestive of 'hemangioblasts'. This was supported by the demonstration that Runx1 is uniformly expressed in blast-like colony-forming cells (BL-CFCs) (Lacaud *et al.*, 2002), which are SCL⁺FLK1⁺ cells with hemangioblast-like properties that can be differentiated *in vitro* from embryonic stem (ES) cells (Choi *et al.*, 1998; Chung *et al.*, 2002). The frequency of BL-CFCs is decreased 10–20-fold in Runx1-deficient ES cells, but primitive hematopoiesis from these *in vitro*-generated BL-CFCs and from the embryonic yolk sac is not impaired (Okuda *et al.*, 1996; Wang *et al.*, 1996a; Lacaud *et al.*, 2002), suggesting that the BL-CFC defect is confined to a hemangioblast population committed to definitive rather than primitive hematopoiesis (Lacaud *et al.*, 2002).

Runx1 is expressed in primitive erythroid precursors in the yolk sac, although its expression extinguishes very quickly as primitive erythrocytes differentiate, and is almost absent in that lineage by E8.5 (North *et al.*, 1999; Lacaud *et al.*, 2002). At E8.5–9.0, there are new sites of Runx1 expression: in endothelial cells and mesenchymal cells in the ventral portion of the paired dorsal aortae in the PAS, in mesenchymal cells at the site of chorioallantoic fusion, in endothelial cells lining the vitelline artery, and in a small percentage of endothelial cells of the yolk sac (North *et al.*, 1999). The first HSCs that can engraft adult mice appear at E10.5 in the dorsal aorta and vitelline and umbilical arteries (Medvinsky *et al.*, 1996; de Bruijn *et al.*, 2000), and all were found to express Runx1 (North *et al.*, 2002). It was further shown that Runx1 is required for the formation of CD45⁺ or c-kit⁺ 'hematopoietic clusters' of cells closely associated with endothelial cells in the lumens of the yolk sac, the vitelline and umbilical arteries, and the ventral aspect of the dorsal aorta (North *et al.*, 1999; Yokomizo *et al.*, 2001). These clusters are thought to differentiate from the endothelium, as demonstrated by vital dye and retroviral labeling of aorta endothelial cells in chick embryos (Jaffredo *et al.*, 1998; Jaffredo *et al.*, 2000), and by *in vitro* generation of both endothelial and hematopoietic cells from isolated vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin)-positive or CD34⁺45⁻ cells (Nishikawa *et al.*, 1998a,b; Fujimoto *et al.*, 2001; Yokomizo *et al.*, 2001; Oberlin *et al.*, 2002; Fraser *et al.*, 2003). Restoration of CBFβ function in endothelium and endothelial progenitors in CBFβ-deficient mice by way of expression from the Tek (Tie-2) regulatory sequences rescued the appearance of definitive hematopoietic progenitors, data that also support a role for Runx1 and CBFβ in the transition of endothelial cells or endothelial progenitors to hematopoietic cells (Miller *et al.*, 2002).

In summary, Runx1 is an early marker of endothelial and mesenchymal cells in the sites of HSC emergence. Its expression in the endothelium is more restricted to sites of HSC emergence than SCL, another early marker of hematopoietic commitment that is expressed in the majority of endothelial cells in the embryo (Elefanty *et al.*, 1999; Sanchez *et al.*, 1999; Sinclair *et al.*, 1999; Gottgens *et al.*, 2004). The first role for core-binding factors is to generate definitive

hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells either from endothelium or endothelial cell precursors (definitive hemangioblasts), and both Runx1 and CBFβ (but not Runx2 or Runx3) are required for this process to occur.

### Core-binding factor expression and function in adult hematopoiesis

The roles of core-binding factors in adult hematopoiesis are gradually being revealed through a combination of approaches including conditional knockouts, conditional rescues, the introduction of markers into the genes and the study of animals with reduced core-binding factor dosage (haploinsufficiency and dominant negative (DN) alleles). We begin this discussion with a review of expression studies, which have been most comprehensively carried out for *Runx1* and *Cbfβ* through the introduction of markers into these genes followed by analyses at the single-cell level by flow cytometry. We then address what is known about the function of all members of the core-binding factor family during hematopoiesis in the adult.

#### Expression analyses

All three *Runx* genes and *Cbfβ* are expressed in adult bone marrow (BM), thymus and peripheral lymphoid organs, in overlapping but different patterns (Miyoshi *et al.*, 1995; Satake *et al.*, 1995; Levanon *et al.*, 1996; Meyers *et al.*, 1996; Le *et al.*, 1999; Vaillant *et al.*, 1999; Chimienti *et al.*, 2000; Hayashi *et al.*, 2000, 2001; Telfer and Rothenberg, 2001; Basecke *et al.*, 2002; Kundu *et al.*, 2002; Taniuchi *et al.*, 2002; Zhao *et al.*, 2002; Bjerregaard *et al.*, 2003; Ehlers *et al.*, 2003; Elagib *et al.*, 2003; Puig-Kroger *et al.*, 2003; Woolf *et al.*, 2003; Fainaru *et al.*, 2004; Lorsbach *et al.*, 2004; North *et al.*, 2004). As mentioned above, the most comprehensive analyses of expression have been made for *Runx1* and *Cbfβ* using knocked-in markers, either *lacZ* or *gfp*. Two different strategies were used to introduce these markers into the *Runx1* locus, and are worth commenting on because they have the potential to yield dissimilar results. North *et al.* (1999) introduced *lacZ* coding sequences into the *Runx1* locus by substituting them for the coding sequences for amino acids 243–451 (exons 5.3 and 6) of what is commonly referred to as the AML1b isoform of Runx1 (containing the VWRPY sequence) (Bae *et al.*, 1993; Levanon *et al.*, 2001b). This approach has several consequences: (1) One *Runx1* allele produces a nonfunctional fusion protein that theoretically has the capacity to act as a dominant inhibitor. Therefore, hematopoiesis in these animals is not entirely normal. (2) The *Runx1* primary transcript is alternatively spliced, but only the isoforms that use the exon 5.3 splice acceptor site can be followed. Lorsbach *et al.* (2004) introduced *gfp* coding sequences into the *Runx1* locus, with translation accessed by an internal ribosome entry site (IRES). Simultaneously, they altered the *Runx1* gene in such a way that all the DNA-binding

proteins produced from that allele contain only the C-
terminal end found in the AML1b and AML1c isoforms
(coded for by exons 3, 4, 5, 5.3 and 6) (Bae *et al.*, 1993;
Levanon *et al.*, 2001b). The advantage of this latter
approach is that a functional *Runx1* allele is maintained,
although the effects of producing only a subset of the
possible *Runx1* isoforms in mice homozygous for the
*Runx1*-IRES-*gfp* allele has not yet been fully assessed. In
fact, a homozygous knock-in of an identical alteration
of *Runx1* coding sequences (minus the *gfp*) resulted in a
decrease in adult spleen CD4 SP cells (Nishimura *et al.*,
2004). Another consequence of the IRES-*gfp* approach
is that post-transcriptional control of *gfp* expression will
be independent of the intricate regulation of *Runx1*
mRNA translation and protein levels (Pozner *et al.*,
2000; Huang *et al.*, 2001). In both the *lacZ* and IRES-
*gfp* knock-in models, the mRNAs transcribed from the
mutant alleles lack the endogenous *Runx1* 3′ UTR. If
these UTR sequences normally affect *Runx1* mRNA
stability (Levanon *et al.*, 1996), removing them could
influence the results. Finally, the two methods probably
differ in their sensitivity, with β-galactosidase activity
being a more sensitive marker. However, despite the
differences and caveats, the general expression patterns
reported from both lines of marked mice are remarkably
similar, and consistent with the results from other
expression studies.

Runx1 is expressed in all BM subsets enriched for
hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (Basecke *et al.*,
2002; Lorsbach *et al.*, 2004; North *et al.*, 2004). In
accordance with this, all long-term repopulating HSCs
and colony forming units-spleen (CFU-S) were exclu-
sively found among Runx1+ BM cells (North *et al.*,
2004), and most CFU-Cs were also Runx1+ (Lorsbach
*et al.*, 2004; North *et al.*, 2004). Runx1 expression
continues upon terminal differentiation of granulocytes
and monocytes, with maturing granulocytes expressing,
on average, lower levels of Runx1 than either their direct
progenitors or monocytes (Basecke *et al.*, 2002; Bjerre-
gaard *et al.*, 2003; Lorsbach *et al.*, 2004; North *et al.*,
2004). Mature macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs)
also expressed Runx1 (North *et al.*, 2004). In BM
erythroid cells, Runx1 is expressed at early stages of
differentiation, from the BFU-E through at least the pro-
erythroblast stage, with expression rapidly declining upon
terminal differentiation (Basecke *et al.*, 2002; Elagib *et al.*,
2003; Lorsbach *et al.*, 2004; North *et al.*, 2004). Runx1 is
also expressed in differentiating megakaryocytes and in
platelets (Elagib *et al.*, 2003; North *et al.*, 2004).

In T-cell development, Runx1 expression has been
detected in all major CD4/CD8 thymocyte populations,
and in peripheral blood and spleen T cells (Levanon
*et al.*, 1996; Hayashi *et al.*, 2000, 2001; Taniuchi *et al.*,
2002; Lorsbach *et al.*, 2004; North *et al.*, 2004). By *in*
*situ* hybridization, Runx1 expression was most intense in
the thymic cortex (Satake *et al.*, 1995; Levanon *et al.*,
1996), where the CD4/CD8 DN immature thymocytes
are located (Gill *et al.*, 2003). The large majority of cells
in the first three DN stages (CD44+CD25−, CD44+CD25+,
CD44−CD25+) expressed Runx1 protein (Lorsbach *et al.*,
2004; North *et al.*, 2004). In the *gfp*

knock-in mice, but not in the *lacZ* mouse model, these
DN1–DN3 populations differed in their Runx1 expres-
sion levels, with the highest expression found at the
DN3 stage (Lorsbach *et al.*, 2004; North *et al.*, 2004).
This is in accordance with strong Runx1 staining, as
detected by immunohistochemistry, in the subcapsular
zone/outer cortex of the thymus, where the DN3 cells
have been shown to reside (Lind *et al.*, 2001; Woolf *et al.*,
2003). In the fourth DN stage (CD44−CD25−), Runx1
expression decreased dramatically (North *et al.*, 2004).
Runx1 mRNA and protein were expressed in CD4/CD8
double positive (DP) and in SP cells, and more so in CD4
than in CD8 SP cells (Taniuchi *et al.*, 2002; Lorsbach *et al.*,
2004; North *et al.*, 2004). In the B-cell lineage, Runx1 was
found in B220+ BM cells, in virtually all peripheral blood B
cells and in the majority of spleen B cells (Chimienti *et al.*,
2000; Basecke *et al.*, 2002; Lorsbach *et al.*, 2004; North
*et al.*, 2004). The percentage of B220+ BM cells expressing
Runx1 varied depending on their differentiation stage, with
the highest percentage of Runx1+ cells in the pre-pro-B-cell popula-
tion, and the lowest percentage in the small pre-B-cell
population (North *et al.*, 2004).

Less information is available concerning Runx2 and
Runx3 expression during adult hematopoiesis, and
reporter models, although available (Otto *et al.*, 1997;
Levanon *et al.*, 2002; Li *et al.*, 2002) have not been used
for this purpose. Runx2 mRNA expression was detected
in peripheral blood B cells (Chimienti *et al.*, 2000), in the
DN and DP cells in the adult thymus, and in both CD4
SP and CD8 SP cells in the thymus and spleen (Satake
*et al.*, 1995; Taniuchi *et al.*, 2002; Zhao *et al.*, 2002),
while in thymocytes Runx2 protein was only detected in
the DN and CD8 SP populations (Vaillant *et al.*, 1999).
Runx3 was highly expressed in BM, spleen, thymus and
peripheral blood, in the myeloid, B and T-cell lineages,
and in mature DCs (Levanon *et al.*, 1996; Meyers *et al.*,
1996; Le *et al.*, 1999; Chimienti *et al.*, 2000; Taniuchi
*et al.*, 2002; Ehlers *et al.*, 2003; Puig-Kroger *et al.*, 2003;
Woolf *et al.*, 2003; Fainaru *et al.*, 2004). Runx3 mRNA
expression was reported in the DN, DP, CD4 and CD8
SP subsets of thymic T cells (Taniuchi *et al.*, 2002;
Ehlers *et al.*, 2003), but Runx3 protein was only detected
in the DN and CD8 SP thymocytes, and by immuno-
histology was most predominant in the medulla in adult
mice where the maturation of CD4 and CD8 SP cells
occurs (Ehlers *et al.*, 2003; Gill *et al.*, 2003; Woolf *et al.*,
2003).

CBFβ expression was studied at the single-cell level
through a knock-in approach that fused *gfp* coding
sequences to those of CBFβ (Kundu *et al.*, 2002). This
strategy produced a hypomorphic *Cbfβ* allele, but since
a twofold reduction in CBFβ levels has never been
shown to have a discernable effect (Sasaki *et al.*, 1996;
Wang *et al.*, 1996a; Niki *et al.*, 1997), we can assume
that hematopoiesis in animals heterozygous for this
allele is normal. CBFβ was expressed in the Lin−c-kit+
BM subset, which is enriched for hematopoietic stem
and progenitor cells, in the majority of BM CFU-Cs,
and in monocytes, granulocytes and megakaryocytes
(Kundu *et al.*, 2002). CBFβ expression, like that of

Runx1, was rapidly extinguished in the definitive erythroid cell lineage, and was no longer detected in the c-kit−Ter119+ population of BM erythroblasts. In BM B-cell progenitors, the highest level of CBFβ expression was found in pro- and pre-B cells, and the lowest in small pre-B cells. Mature BM B cells uniformly expressed only low levels of CBFβ (Kundu et al., 2002). All thymocyte populations expressed CBFβ mRNA and protein (Kundu et al., 2002; Taniuchi et al., 2002).

### Function of core-binding factors in adult hematopoiesis

The widespread hematopoietic expression, the crucial role of Runx1 during embryogenesis, and the association of RUNX1 and CBFB mutations with leukemia contributed to the expectation that Runx1-CBFβ is a crucial transcription factor for maintaining normal adult hematopoiesis. Recently, however, a conditional deletion of Runx1 in all hematopoietic cells of adult mice revealed a surprisingly mild phenotype, as the mice survived and were apparently healthy (Ichikawa et al., 2004). This is reminiscent of the results obtained with SCL conditional knockout animals (Hall et al., 2003; Mikkola et al., 2003; Curtis et al., 2004), and suggests that the molecular mechanisms involved in the initial generation of the hematopoietic system differ from those required for its maintenance.

### Runx1 function in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells

Deletion of Runx1 in adult mice with Mx1-Cre did not abolish HSC function, as normal levels of neutrophils and hemoglobin were maintained in peripheral blood over a 4-month period, and BM cells from the deleted mice could reconstitute hematopoiesis (granulocytes and monocytes) when transplanted into irradiated recipient mice (Ichikawa et al., 2004). The numbers of cells expressing markers of HSCs and immature progenitors (Lin−/lo c-KithiSca-1hi) were elevated in the BM of Mx1-Cre-deleted mice, as were the numbers and serial replating capacity of CFU-Cs. The effects on hematopoietic progenitors and HSCs were very reminiscent of what was seen in mice expressing the AML1/ETO protein, either from a knocked-in Runx1 locus or from retrovirally transduced BM cells (de Guzman et al., 2002; Higuchi et al., 2002). Spontaneous leukemia was not observed either upon Runx1 deletion or AML1/ETO expression (Yuan et al., 2001; de Guzman et al., 2002; Higuchi et al., 2002; Ichikawa et al., 2004), consistent with a model in which the increase in HSC and progenitor populations represents a preleukemic state, and additional mutations are required for progression to AML.

### Runx1 function in megakaryocytes and platelets

In accordance with a previously reported role for Runx1 in megakaryocyte differentiation (Elagib et al., 2003),

deletion of Runx1 with Mx1-Cre in adult mice resulted in a severe impairment of platelet formation and megakaryocyte differentiation, evidenced by the replacement of normal megakaryocytes with ‘micromegakaryocytes’ in BM, that was accompanied by an increase in the number of in vitro megakaryocyte clonogenic progenitors (CFU-Meg) (Ichikawa et al., 2004). This was a particularly satisfying result, as haploinsufficiency of RUNX1 causes a familial platelet disorder in humans characterized by reduced platelet numbers, prolonged bleeding times and abnormal responses to agonists of platelet aggregation (FPD/AML) (Luddy et al., 1978; Dowton et al., 1985; Gerrard et al., 1991; Song et al., 1999).

#### Core-binding factor function in the erythroid lineage

Aside from anecdotal reports that a knocked-in CBFB-MYH11 allele partially delays primitive erythroid cell differentiation in the embryo (Castilla et al., 1996), and that both the numbers of primitive erythroid cells and levels of Ter119 expression on these cells were reduced in Runx1-deficient embryos (Yokomizo et al., 2000), there are few other data to indicate that any of the core-binding factors are required either for primitive erythropoiesis in the embryo (Okuda et al., 1996; Sasaki et al., 1996; Wang et al., 1996a,b) or definitive erythropoiesis in the fetus or adult mouse (Miller et al., 2002; Ichikawa et al., 2004).

#### Core-binding factor function in monocytes and granulocytes

Runx1 does not seem to be crucial for terminal monocyte and granulocyte maturation despite its robust expression in these lineages. Adult mice lacking Runx1 had morphologically normal monocytes and granulocytes, and peripheral blood neutrophil counts were indistinguishable from those of controls (Ichikawa et al., 2004). On the other hand, CBFβ deficiencies have been associated with monocyte and neutrophil defects. A mouse model, in which CBFβ was restored in endothelial cells and fetal hematopoietic progenitors but not in myeloid cells via a Tek-CBFβ transgene, revealed significant decreases in E17.5 fetal liver monocyte and neutrophil counts (Miller et al., 2002). In addition, CBFB/MYH11 knock-in mouse ES cells did not contribute to myeloid lineage cells in chimeric mice (Castilla et al., 1999). These studies suggested that Runx proteins do play a role in monocyte and neutrophil maturation. At present, it is not clear which of the Runx proteins would be important in this, as Runx2 and/or Runx3 could be covering for the Runx1 deletion in the conditional knockout mouse, and/or have their own specific role(s). Defects in granulocyte and monocyte differentiation have also been reported in cell line and mouse models for AML1/ETO leukemia that relied on ectopic and overexpression strategies (Kohzaki et al., 1999; Burel et al., 2001; Sykes and Kamps, 2001; de Guzman et al., 2002; Hug et al., 2002). Based on the

conditional Runx1 knockout and CBFβ data, it can be hypothesized that the differentiation defects associated with AML1/ETO overexpression are probably caused by the inhibition of other Runx family members. Notably, defects in the monocyte and granulocyte lineages were not observed in a mouse knock-in of the t(8;21), which should more accurately model both the absolute and relative levels of AML1/ETO and Runx1 found in leukemic cells (Higuchi *et al.*, 2002). In accordance with this, some terminal myeloid cell differentiation is generally seen in leukemic clones from patients with t(8;21) leukemia (Berger *et al.*, 1982; Swirsky *et al.*, 1984). These data illustrate the importance of considering the dosage of dominant inhibitors of Runx1 and CBFβ when designing leukemia models and interpreting the results from them.

### Core-binding factors in B-cell development

Runx1 deletion in adult BM by Mx1-Cre did not seem to affect the presence of the common lymphocyte progenitor (CLP) population (Ichikawa *et al.*, 2004). However, B220⁺ cells in which Runx1 was deleted by Mx1-Cre were under-represented in the spleen, and Runx1-deleted BM cells did not give rise to B220⁺ lymphocytes upon transplantation into mice. These data suggested that a block occurred in a cell later than the CLP (Ichikawa *et al.*, 2004). CBFβ was also shown to be required for B-cell development. Restoration of CBFβ in Tek⁺ endothelium and fetal hematopoietic progenitor cells could not prevent a significant decrease in B220⁺ cells later in development (Tek is expressed in ≤2% of B220⁺ cells) (Yano *et al.*, 1997; Miller *et al.*, 2002). ES cells carrying a knock-in of CBFB/MYH11 did not contribute to the B-lymphoid lineage in chimeric mice, further supporting a requirement for CBFβ in B-cell development (Castilla *et al.*, 1999).

*In vitro* and cell line studies suggested that Runx3 cooperates with Smads to mediate transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) activation of the germline Ig α promoter, an event that precedes IgA class switching (Shi and Stavnezer, 1998). This finding was borne out in mouse studies that showed that TGF-β-dependent IgA class switching was abrogated in splenocytes from Runx3-deficient mice (Fainaru *et al.*, 2004). Thus Runx3 function appears to be required for normal B-cell development, but at a later stage than Runx1 function.

### Core-binding factors in T-cell development

The core-binding factors appear to play important roles at multiple steps of T-cell development and lineage specification. A decreased contribution to peripheral T cells was observed in mice in which Runx1 was deleted with either Mx1- or lck-Cre (Taniuchi *et al.*, 2002; Ichikawa *et al.*, 2004). In addition, Runx1 Mx1-Cre-deleted BM was unable to contribute to the T-cell lineage upon competitive transplantation into irradiated

adult recipient mice (Ichikawa *et al.*, 2004). Analysis of the recipients' thymuses revealed a profound block in the maturation of donor cells at the DN2 stage (Ichikawa *et al.*, 2004). No data are available regarding the molecular mechanism underlying this block, and no putative Runx target genes have been identified that are essential for the DN2 to DN3 transition. Deletion of Runx1 using lck-Cre, on the other hand, increased the proportion of DN3 fetal thymocytes at the expense of DN4 cells (Taniuchi *et al.*, 2002). This later differentiation block could be explained by the delayed onset of lck-Cre expression during thymopoiesis compared with Mx1-Cre. The bulk of TCRβ rearrangements take place at the DN3 stage, and successfully rearranged TCRβ chains are presented on the cell membrane in the pre-TCR complex, which is required for efficient β-selection (Gill *et al.*, 2003). The observed cellular increase at the DN3 stage, which is the same stage at which the Rag1 and Rag2 recombinases are required (Mombaerts *et al.*, 1992; Shinkai *et al.*, 1992), suggests that Runx1 is involved in β-chain rearrangements and/or β-selection (Taniuchi *et al.*, 2002). This is consistent with data suggesting that CD3ε and all of the TCR genes are Runx1 targets (Hallberg *et al.*, 1992; Prosser *et al.*, 1992; Hsiang *et al.*, 1993; Giese *et al.*, 1995; Lauzurica *et al.*, 1997). Rearrangement of the TCRδ gene (at the VD to J step in a TCRδ minilocus) was significantly inhibited upon mutation of a Runx-binding site within its enhancer (Lauzurica *et al.*, 1997), and Runx-binding sites in an intergenic silencer are important for the proper expression of Rag1 and Rag2 (primarily at the DP stage) (Yannoutsos *et al.*, 2004). Thus, the potential inability to rearrange and express a functional pre-TCR on the T-cell surface in lck-Cre-deleted mice provides a reasonable mechanistic explanation for the block observed at the DN3 to DN4 transition.

Cells that pass β-selection go on to develop into DP thymocytes, with a concomitant increase in proliferation (Gill *et al.*, 2003). Thymus cellularity was decreased upon deletion of Runx1 with lck-Cre, indicating a role for Runx1 in the control of thymocyte numbers, possibly through an effect on proliferation during the transition from DN to DP cells (Taniuchi *et al.*, 2002; Sato *et al.*, 2003). Reduced thymocyte counts were also seen upon deletion of the C-terminal VWRPY sequence in Runx1, suggesting that the interaction of Runx1 with the mammalian Groucho homolog, transducin-like enhancer of split (TLE) (Imai *et al.*, 1998; Levanon *et al.*, 1998), is required for normal thymocyte numbers (Nishimura *et al.*, 2004).

Both Runx1 and Runx3 appear to be required for the repression of CD4, which is essential for proper development of DN thymocytes and CD8 SP cells (Taniuchi *et al.*, 2002; Woolf *et al.*, 2003). Repression of the CD4 gene requires two core sites within an intronic CD4 silencer (Taniuchi *et al.*, 2002). Runx1 is crucial for CD4 repression in the DN cell population (Taniuchi *et al.*, 2002), and the VWRPY motif may be required for Runx1 to repress CD4 in the fetal thymus, but not in the adult (Nishimura *et al.*, 2004). The nuclear matrix association region and the region between aa 212 and

262 (with an unknown function) of Runx1 were implicated in CD4 repression (Telfer *et al.*, 2004). Runx3 was shown to be the main effector of CD4 repression in CD8 SP cells (Taniuchi *et al.*, 2002; Ehlers *et al.*, 2003; Woolf *et al.*, 2003). Deletion of Runx3 caused a large number of peripheral CD8⁺ T cells to retain CD4 expression, and negatively affected both their proliferation and function (Taniuchi *et al.*, 2002; Woolf *et al.*, 2003). Reduced Runx1 dosage in combination with Runx3 deficiency completely derepressed CD4 expression in all peripheral T cells, resulting in a total absence of CD8 SP cells (Woolf *et al.*, 2003). Runx2 has not been implicated in CD4 silencing. Runx2-deficient fetuses had significantly decreased thymocyte numbers (Komori *et al.*, 1997), but transplantation of Runx2-deficient BM revealed normal CD4 and CD8 expression and normal thymocyte numbers (Taniuchi *et al.*, 2002).

Diminished Runx1 dosage, either through haploinsufficiency or hemizygosity for a weak DN allele (*Runxl*), or overexpression of a DN Runx1 protein, was also found to affect T-cell differentiation (Hayashi *et al.*, 2000; Komine *et al.*, 2003; Woolf *et al.*, 2003; Lorsbach *et al.*, 2004; North *et al.*, 2004). In most mouse models, mice with reduced Runx1 dosage had decreased thymocyte counts, and all showed lower numbers of CD4 and CD8 SP thymocytes and peripheral T cells, but no accumulation of cells at any of the DN stages or obvious CD4 derepression was observed (Hayashi *et al.*, 2000; Lorsbach *et al.*, 2004; North *et al.*, 2004). Overexpression of a Runx1 Runt domain in T cells from the CD2 promoter (which would presumably inhibit all Runx proteins) impaired the differentiation of DP to CD4 SP and CD8 SP cells, and diminished the differentiation of CD4 SP cells into the Th2 lineage (Hayashi *et al.*, 2000; Komine *et al.*, 2003). We can conclude that a ≥50% reduction in Runx1 dosage is sufficient to perturb maturation of SP thymocytes and peripheral T-cell counts.

Increased Runx1 levels in transgenic mice, through overexpression from the CD2 promoter, resulted in an increase in postselection CD8 SP thymocytes, skewing even MHC class II restricted cells into the CD8 lineage, and these cells were unable to mature (Hayashi *et al.*, 2001). Overexpression of Runx2 from the CD2 promoter led to an accumulation of cells at the CD8 immature SP (ISP) stage that were delayed in differentiation to DP cells (Vaillant *et al.*, 1999).

Restoration of CBFβ in Tek⁺ endothelium and fetal hematopoietic progenitor cells resulted in reduced fetal thymus cellularity and an increase in the ratio of CD4/8 SP cells (Miller *et al.*, 2002). However, the T-cell differentiation block was not as severe as that seen upon Runx1 deletion by *Mx1-Cre*, suggesting that the Tek regulatory sequences were still active at a developmental stage critical for the DN2 to DN3 transition. Alternatively, Runx1 function may not require the CBFβ subunit to the same extent in fetal T-cell development as in adult T-cell development or as during the establishment of definitive hematopoiesis in the embryo (Sasaki *et al.*, 1996; Wang *et al.*, 1996b; Niki *et al.*, 1997; Ichikawa *et al.*, 2004).


Core-binding factors

MFTR de Bruijn and NA Speck

In summary, the Runx proteins play nonredundant roles at different stages of T-cell differentiation, including early DN development, regulation of cell numbers, and maturation and function of CD8 and CD4 SP lymphocytes. This is reflected in their overlapping but unique expression patterns. CBFβ is uniformly expressed in all T cells, but its role at each stage in T-cell development has not been extensively studied.

### Core-binding factors, autoimmunity and inflammation

A remarkable recent discovery was that core-binding factors are linked to three autoimmune diseases that commonly afflict humans: systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and psoriasis (Prokunina *et al.*, 2002; Helms *et al.*, 2003; Tokuhira *et al.*, 2003). SLE is a multi-organ disease characterized by immune dysregulation resulting in the production of antinuclear antibodies, circulating immune complexes and activation of the complement system. One of the susceptibility loci for SLE (*SLEB2*) found in Nordic multi-case families is a gene called programmed cell death 1 (*PDCD1*) (Prokunina *et al.*, 2002), which encodes PD-1, a member of the immunoglobulin family expressed on lymphocytes and monocytes, which regulates peripheral self-tolerance in T and B cells (Agata *et al.*, 1996; Nishimura *et al.*, 1999). PD-1 deactivates signaling and inhibits cytokine production upon phosphorylation of the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif in its cytoplasmic tail by the Src homology 2 protein tyrosine phosphatase 2 (SHP-2) (Okazaki *et al.*, 2001). A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) was identified in the fourth intron of *PDCD1*, within an enhancer-like structure that contains binding sites for several transcription factors known to be active in T cells (E-box-binding proteins, NF-κB and the Runx proteins), that disrupts one of the Runx-binding (core) sites (TGCGGT→TGCAGT) (Prokunina *et al.*, 2002). The deregulation of *PDCD1* expression that would presumably result from this mutation might contribute to the disregulated self-tolerance and chronic lymphocyte hyperactivation that is characteristic of SLE.

Psoriasis is an immune-mediated chronic skin disease characterized by raised red skin covered by flaky white, silvery plaques. An SNP associated with psoriasis that eliminated a core site was found between two genes, *SLC9A3R1* and *NAT9* (TGTGGT→TGTAGT) (Helms *et al.*, 2003). *SLC9A3R1* encodes a PDZ domain-containing protein implicated in epithelial membrane biology and immune synapse formation in T cells (Reczek *et al.*, 1997; Itoh *et al.*, 2002), while *NAT9* encodes an N-acetyltransferase. It is not yet clear which of the two genes (or both) is affected by the SNP (Helms *et al.*, 2003).

RA is characterized by a chronic inflammation of joints that ultimately leads to the destruction of bone and cartilage. An SNP in intron 1 of the *SLC22A4* gene encoding solute carrier family 22, member 4 was found to be associated with an increased risk of RA (Tokuhira

et al., 2003). Solute carrier family 22, member 4 is a transporter of organic molecules that is expressed in immunological and hematopoietic organs and cells, and its expression is induced by proinflammatory stimuli (Tokuhira et al., 2003). The SNP is in a core site located in the first intron of SCL22A4 (TGTGGT→TGTGGC) and moderately affects Runx1 DNA-binding affinity (Tokuhira et al., 2003) (a comparison of the Runt domain affinity for these two sites revealed an approximate twofold difference; Lewis et al., 1999). An SNP in

intron 6 (intron 5.2 according to Levanon et al., 2001b) of the RUNX1 gene itself was also strongly associated with RA (Tokuhira et al., 2003), providing evidence that the Runx1 protein may contribute to the regulation of SCL22A4.

Core-binding factors have also been implicated in inflammatory processes. Functional assays in mouse showed that Runx3 deficiency causes a transient airway inflammation that is thought to involve an acceleration of DC maturation accompanied by an increased ability

to present antigen and activate T cells (Fainaru *et al.*, 2004). This uncontrolled maturation of DCs contributes to a transient accumulation of eosinophils in the lung alveoli of young mice that is reminiscent of allergic asthma and eosinophilic bronchitis in humans.

### Concluding remarks

Since the discovery of the core-binding factor genes 10 years ago, the exploration of their functions in normal hematopoiesis, leukemia and autoimmunity has become an exciting field of inquiry. We have summarized the expression and function of core-binding factors throughout hematopoietic development in Figure 1, and are struck by the observation that almost all hematopoietic lineages save erythrocytes (both primitive and definitive) seem to be affected at one or more points in their differentiation by mutations in core-binding factor genes. These functions and expression patterns shed light on one of the original observations about core-binding factors and their role in murine retroviral pathogenesis. One of several lines of investigation that led to the discovery of the core-binding factors was that they bound to the 'core' sites in the enhancers of retroviruses that caused T-cell leukemias, and a core-binding activity was found to be particularly abundant in T cells (Speck and Baltimore, 1987; Thornell *et al.*, 1988; Boral *et al.*, 1989). A mutation in the core site of the Moloney murine leukemia virus changed its disease specificity from T-cell leukemia to erythroleukemia, and led to the hypothesis that the mutation disrupted the binding of a protein that is highly expressed in T cells, and caused transcription and replication of the virus to be selectively dampened in T cells relative to erythroid progenitors (Speck *et al.*, 1990). To see that original observation come full circle with the abundant evidence

for core-binding factor functions in T cell, but not in erythrocyte differentiation, is satisfying and yet another excellent example of how the study of retroviruses has provided an inroad into an important problem in developmental biology and cancer.

One theme of this review is that both the spatiotemporal expression of Runx proteins and their levels (particularly Runx1 levels) are critical for normal hematopoiesis. The fact that different Runx family members bind the same consensus DNA sequence seems to build some redundancy into the system, although in general their roles are segregated by their different expression patterns. A good example of this is the requirement for Runx1 in the repression of CD4 in DN thymocytes, and Runx3 in the repression of CD4 in CD8 SP cells, which matches their expression patterns in the thymus. The strongest Runx1 expression was found in the cortex where the DN reside, while the Runx3 staining was strongest in the medulla where the CD8 SP reside. Another pattern that has emerged is that in lineages (for example, T and B cells) where both Runx1 and Runx3 function, the requirement for Runx1 precedes that for Runx3. Finally, we have noted numerous examples of Runx1 dosage effects, both in hematopoietic development in mice and in human disease. With the advent of conditional knock-in and knockout models, hypomorphic alleles and gene expression arrays, we expect that the near future will bring better insight into the roles of these factors in hematopoiesis, and that this in turn will shed light on the pathogenic processes of the leukemias and autoimmune diseases in which these proteins participate.

### Figure 1 Schematic representation of core-binding factor expression and function during late fetal (E17.5) and adult hematopoiesis. (a) Expression of Runx1-β-galactosidase (orange bars), CBFβ-GFP (green bars) and Runx3 (detected by immunohistochemistry; yellow bar), in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and during myeloid differentiation (Kundu *et al.*, 2002; Fainaru *et al.*, 2004; North *et al.*, 2004). Percentages of positive cells are indicated where known (for simplicity sake the numbers for Runx1 are derived from one source (North *et al.*, 2004)). Relative changes in expression levels are indicated by the intensity of the colored bar. Open bars with ‘ND’ denote cells in which expression was ‘not determined’ but are presumed to express the relevant protein. The percentage of Runx1-expressing HSCs and progenitors (CFU-S, CFU-GEMM, BFU-E, CFU-GM) is based on functional data (Lorsbach *et al.*, 2004; North *et al.*, 2004). CBFβ is expressed in the majority of cells with HSC and progenitor cell markers, but functional data are available only for CFU-GEMM, BFU-E and CFU-GM (Kundu *et al.*, 2002). A solid line indicates that the lineage is absent or severely affected, and arrows indicate decreased or increased cell or progenitor numbers associated with Runx3 deficiency (Fainaru *et al.*, 2004), conditional Runx1 deletion (Ichikawa *et al.*, 2004) or conditional CBFβ rescue (Miller *et al.*, 2002). Conditional Runx1 deficiency enhances CFU-C numbers, impairs megakaryocyte maturation and severely blocks platelet formation (Ichikawa *et al.*, 2004). Although an increase in Lin⁻c-kit⁺Sca1⁺ cells was observed in Runx1-deleted BM (Ichikawa *et al.*, 2004), an increase in HSC numbers has not yet been confirmed by functional analyses. Runx3 deficiency accelerates DC maturation (Fainaru *et al.*, 2004). The precise stage at which CBFβ is required in the monocyte and granulocyte lineages is not known. (b) Expression of Runx1-β-galactosidase (orange bar), CBFβ-GFP (green bar) and Runx3 (detected by immunohistochemistry; yellow bar) in the B-lymphoid lineage. The precise stage(s) at which Runx1 and CBFβ affect B lymphopoiesis have not been studied, although a decrease in peripheral B cells was reported (Castilla *et al.*, 1999; Miller *et al.*, 2002; Ichikawa *et al.*, 2004). Runx3 deficiency was recently shown to block IgA class switching (Fainaru *et al.*, 2004). (c) Schematic representation of T-cell differentiation in the thymus (adapted from Starr *et al.*, 2003), with expression of Runx1-β-galactosidase (orange bars), Runx2 (salmon bars), Runx3 (yellow bars) and CBFβ-GFP (green bars). Runx2 and Runx3 proteins were detected by immunocytochemistry. The percentages of positive cells are given where known. Protein expression data for Runx2, Runx3 and CBFβ were reported using unseparated DN populations (containing DN1–4). Therefore, it remains to be established in which DN subsets these proteins are expressed. Runx2 and Runx3 mRNA were detected in a broader range of thymocytes than indicated in the figure (see the accompanying text for description). Effects of Runx3 deficiency (Taniuchi *et al.*, 2002; Woolf *et al.*, 2003), conditional Runx1 deletion (Taniuchi *et al.*, 2002; Ichikawa *et al.*, 2004) or conditional CBFβ rescue (Miller *et al.*, 2002) are indicated at relevant stages, following the scheme described in (a). Not illustrated is decreased thymocyte numbers caused by Runx1, Runx2 or CBFβ deficiency (Komori *et al.*, 1997; Miller *et al.*, 2002; Taniuchi *et al.*, 2002)
