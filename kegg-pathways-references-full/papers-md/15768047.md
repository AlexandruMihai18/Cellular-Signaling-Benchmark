CALORIE RESTRICTION, SIRT1 AND METABOLISM: UNDERSTANDING LONGEVITY

**Laura Bordone and Leonard Guarente**

Abstract | Calorie restriction (CR) is the only experimental manipulation that is known to extend the lifespan of a number of organisms including yeast, worms, flies, rodents and perhaps non-human primates. In addition, CR has been shown to reduce the incidence of age-related disorders (for example, diabetes, cancer and cardiovascular disorders) in mammals. The mechanisms through which this occurs have been unclear. CR induces metabolic changes, improves insulin sensitivity and alters neuroendocrine function in animals. In this review, we summarize recent findings that are beginning to clarify the mechanisms by which CR results in longevity and robust health, which might open new avenues of therapy for diseases of ageing.

Numerous studies have shown that a moderate reduction in calorie intake of 20–40% might slow ageing, reduce age-related chronic diseases and extend lifespan. Evidence for this surprising phenomenon first emerged in the 1930s when McCay and colleagues¹ learned that rodents that were fed measured amounts of food lived much longer than their *ad libitum* (freely fed) counterparts. It turned out that a reduction in calories was responsible for this beneficial effect. Similar effects have been observed in various species from worms and yeast to rats and fish²⁻⁴, and although it is uncertain whether long-term calorie restriction (CR) has the same effect in primates, preliminary evidence suggests that it might⁵⁻⁷. Indeed, studies in humans indicate that some markers of ageing, such as the levels of blood glucose, blood pressure and cholesterol, improve on CR diets⁸⁻¹¹.

Here, we summarize some of the classic literature on CR, and focus on metabolic changes that occur on a low-calorie diet and how they might influence longevity. We also discuss recent molecular findings on ageing and its regulation by *SIR2*-related genes. We attempt to explain some of the physiological changes that are elicited by CR in terms of the known and postulated functions of the mammalian Sir2 orthologue, *SIRT1*.

**Calorie restriction and lifespan**

The average and maximum lifespans of a range of organisms — from yeast and nematodes to rodents and monkeys — can be increased by up to 50% simply by reducing their calorie intake compared with what they would eat *ad libitum*. As shown by microarray analysis, CR actually forestalls many progressive changes that occur during ageing¹²⁻¹⁴. CR also reduces the incidence of age-related cancer, cardiovascular disease and immune deficiencies in rodents and in non-human primates⁴,¹⁵⁻¹⁹. So, we infer that physiological changes that are elicited by CR contribute towards a condition of robust health, and that these same changes trigger greater longevity. In humans, it is clear that chronic high calorie intake over time is a risk factor in cardiovascular disease, many types of cancers, type-2 diabetes and stroke. However, there are no studies as yet to indicate that CR reduces disease or mortality risk compared with *ad libitum* individuals who are not overweight.

In a variation on the theme of CR, the time between meals might be as important as the total food intake. After maintenance on an every-other-day feeding schedule with no reduction in overall calories (with maintained vitamin and mineral intake), intermittently

REACTIVE OXYGEN SPECIES (ROS). A reactive intermediate oxygen species that usually contains an unpaired electron in its outermost shell of electrons. Examples include: superoxide anion ($\mathrm{O}_2^{\bullet-}$), hydroxyl radical ($\mathrm{OH}^\bullet$), hydroxyl ion ($\mathrm{OH}^-$), hydrogen peroxide ($\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}_2$) and hypochlorite ion ($\mathrm{OCl}^-$).

ELECTRON-TRANSPORT CHAIN The electron-transport chain comprises complexes I–IV and an ATPase, which couples the transfer of an electron from NADH or FADH to molecular oxygen ($\mathrm{O}_2$). This process pumps protons ($\mathrm{H}^+$) across the mitochondrial membrane, which generates a proton gradient, the energy of which drives ATP synthesis by the ATPase.

Box 1 | Metabolic changes during starvation

Important metabolic changes (glycogen mobilization, fat mobilization, gluconeogenesis, ketogenesis and, possibly, thermogenesis) and changes in hormone levels (insulin, glucagon, adipokines, glucocorticoids) and in the levels of regulatory proteins (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)$\gamma$, PPAR$\gamma$ coactivator-1$\alpha$ (PGC1$\alpha$), forkhead protein FOXO, SIRT1 and, possibly, uncoupling proteins (UCPs)) take place during overnight starvation. Physiological adaptations to starvation preserve glucose for the brain. During starvation, the low level of glucose in the blood leads to a decreased secretion of insulin and an increased secretion of glucagon. This induces gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis in the liver and the mobilization of triglycerides from the white adipose tissue. Prolonged starvation leads to the production of ketone bodies by the liver, which are released in the blood and used as an energy source for the brain. Glucocorticoids from the adrenal glands help induce gluconeogenesis, reduce glucose utilization by the muscles, and increase lypolysis and protein breakdown. We speculate that calorie restriction might also induce thermogenesis by upregulating UCPs. Some of these changes are due to the induction of regulatory transcription factors, such as FOXO. For a discussion of SIRT1, see main text.

fed mice showed similar metabolic changes to mice that were kept on a calorie-restricted diet, including a decrease in body temperature, decreased heart rate and blood pressure, and decreased glucose and **insulin** levels${}^{20,21}$. It is possible that the long periods of fasting in this regimen bring about the physiological changes that extend lifespan.

Calorie restriction, SIR2 and metabolism

To survive over evolutionary time, organisms had to adapt to changes in food availability. One such adaptation is the ability to store energy in the form of glycogen and lipids for use when food supply is scarce and organisms are faced with an acute energy deficit (BOX 1). This circumstance induces changes in gene expression that result in adaptive changes in cellular metabolism and the mobilization of energy stores for short-term use.

An appealing early hypothesis held that cutting calories increased longevity by simply slowing metabolism, and reducing oxygen radicals and accompanying cellular damage throughout the body${}^{22-24}$. Oxygen radicals are highly reactive chemical species that carry an unpaired electron, which can damage surrounding macromolecules, lipids, proteins and DNA${}^{25-28}$. Energy metabolism in aerobic organisms is coupled to the generation of REACTIVE OXYGEN SPECIES (ROS). In eukaryotes, mitochondria are the prime site of ROS generation, because complex I and complex III of the ELECTRON-TRANSPORT CHAIN occasionally generate these toxic by-products during normal respiration${}^{29}$. Oxidative damage (BOX 2) is strongly implicated in the development of disease pathogenesis, including atherosclerosis, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, skin and neurodegenerative disorders, and cancer${}^{30}$. Furthermore, oxidative damage increases with age and undoubtedly contributes to the ageing phenotype.

However, early claims that CR worked by simply reducing the metabolic rate have not held up. Masoro and co-workers showed that metabolic rate normalized to body weight did not decline in CR mice, and the lifetime metabolic output of these animals was therefore larger than their *ad libitum* cohorts${}^{31}$. Respiration actually increases during CR in yeast${}^{32}$, and a small increase has been reported in the nematode worm *Caenorhabditis elegans*${}^{33}$.

Alternatively, more recent studies indicate that CR is a highly regulated process that requires regulatory proteins that can sense scarcity and mount an appropriate physiological response. An early indication that this might be the case came from studies in the budding yeast *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*. The silencing of genes in the ribosomal DNA is a longevity determinant in this

Box 2 | ROS production

Glucose metabolism generates acetyl-CoA, which drives the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle in the mitochondria to produce NADH (see figure, part a). The electrons of NADH are channelled into complex I of the electron-transport chain and down the other three complexes, as shown. Complexes I–IV pump protons ($\mathrm{H}^+$) from the mitochondrial matrix to the cytoplasm, thereby generating a proton gradient. Occasionally, electrons can leak out of complex I and II of the electron-transport chain and generate reactive oxygen species (ROS). The pathway by which electrons from the electron-transport chain generate ROS is shown in part b of the figure. The main reactive ROS are superoxide anion ($\mathrm{O}_2^{\bullet-}$), hydrogen peroxide ($\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}_2$) and the hydroxyl radical ($\mathrm{OH}^\bullet$).

Figure 1 | Models of calorie restriction in yeast. Sir2 might connect cellular energetics to lifespan. The figure shows two possible models for how glucose might regulate Sir2 activity in yeast under (a) ad libitum (or freely fed) or (b) calorie restriction (CR) conditions. Under ad libitum conditions, glucose is metabolized by glycolysis, whereas under CR conditions, there is a shift towards respiration. According to one model, the NAD/NADH ratio is increased in CR due to higher levels of respiration, and thereby triggers an increase in Sir2 activity. A different model proposes that pyrazinamide/nicotinamidase-1 (PNC1) is induced during CR, thereby lowering the levels of the Sir2 inhibitor nicotinamide (NA) and increasing Sir2 activity.

such as p53 and FORKHEAD<sup>44–48</sup>. Furthermore, SIRT1 is expressed throughout all mammalian somatic and germ tissues, which makes it a good candidate to regulate the known effects of CR on the soma and the germline<sup>49</sup>. Below we discuss aspects of CR in mammals and suggest possible links with SIRT1.

### Calorie restriction and fat

Ageing is accompanied by changes in the levels and distribution of fat, and there is a gradual increase in fat of ~1 lb per year in humans. Much recent research has shown that the fat-storage depot, WHITE ADIPOSE TISSUE (WAT), has another function besides fat storage. WAT is an endocrine organ, which produces hormones that are active throughout the body<sup>50</sup>. These hormones include tumour necrosis factor-α (TNFα), resistin, adiponectin and leptin.

#### TNFα and resistin

TNFα and resistin have been shown to trigger insulin resistance in animals<sup>51–53</sup>. In vitro cell-culture studies have indicated that TNFα can render cells insulin resistant through downregulation of the synthesis of the glucose transporter as well as through interference with insulin signalling<sup>54</sup>. In vivo, the absence of the TNFα receptor significantly improves insulin sensitivity; that is, the ability of insulin to facilitate glucose uptake in metabolic tissues in rodent models of obesity<sup>55,56</sup>. Interestingly, it has been shown that CR attenuates the age-related upregulation of nuclear factor (NF)-κB<sup>57</sup>, which is a transcription factor that induces the expression of TNFα<sup>58</sup> in WAT and the production of inflammatory cytokines in immune cells. In this regard, SIRT1 was recently shown to deacetylate and downregulate NF-κB<sup>59</sup>. It is intriguing to speculate that the upregulation of SIRT1 by CR contributes to the observed increase in insulin sensitivity and reduction in inflammation.

Resistin increased the levels of blood glucose and insulin in mice<sup>60</sup>. In addition, anti-resistin antibodies decreased blood glucose and improved insulin sensitivity in obese mice<sup>53</sup>. Resistin also suppressed insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in cultured 3T3-L1 cells (a cell model for adipocytes), and this effect was prevented by anti-resistin antibodies<sup>60</sup>. Changes in resistin that are correlated with CR have yet to be reported, but a recent study showed that healthy, normal-weight humans showed no changes in circulating resistin levels when they were subjected to weight loss<sup>61</sup>.

#### Leptin and adiponectin

Leptin and adiponectin are two hormones that are produced by WAT<sup>62</sup>. In addition to its role in satiety, leptin reduces the level of stress hormones<sup>50</sup> and increases thyroid activity and thyroid hormone levels (which increases energy expenditure)<sup>63</sup>. CR upregulates stress hormones and downregulates thyroid hormones, possibly by reducing leptin levels<sup>50</sup>. However, it is unlikely that leptin is the ultimate mediator of CR because mice that lack leptin (which mimics the effect of CR in the extreme) actually have short lifespans and are obese, yet CR can still extend the lifespan in such mice<sup>64</sup>.

HISTONE DEACETYLASE  
An enzyme and chromatin-remodelling factor that deacetylates histone proteins. Because deacetylation is energetically favoured, the class-I and -II deacetylases do not require any cofactors, such as ATP or NAD. However, the Sir2 class-III histone deacetylase uses NAD as a co-substrate.

NICOTINAMIDE  
One of the cleavage products of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) that is produced in each deacetylation cycle (along with acetyl-ADP-ribose). It is also a non-competitive inhibitor of Sir2 deacetylases.

SIRTUIN  
A protein that has sequence homology to the conserved enzymatic domain of yeast Sir2. In mammals, there are seven sirtuins, SIRT1–7.

FORKHEAD TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR  
A member of a conserved family of transcription factors. Forkhead transcription factors belong to the winged-helix class of DNA-binding proteins. They function as key regulators of stress resistance and metabolism in mammals and of lifespan in C. elegans.

WHITE ADIPOSE TISSUE (WAT). A depot of specialized cells that function as the main storage site for fat in the form of triglycerides. WAT has different functions, such as a heat insulator, a mechanical cushion and, most importantly, a source of energy. Also, WAT has been found to produce hormones, the levels of which are regulated by the amount of stored fat.

HYPERINSULINAEMIA A state of abnormally high levels of insulin in the blood. One cause of hyper-insulinaemia is high insulin production by pancreatic β-cells to compensate for insulin resistance in peripheral tissues.

HYPERGLYCAEMIA A state of high levels of glucose in the blood. Hyperglycaemia is usually an early sign of insulin resistance, which can lead to diabetes mellitus.

Adiponectin has been shown to trigger insulin sensitivity ${ }^{62,65}$. It does this, in part, by upregulating AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in target tissues ${ }^{66}$. This kinase regulates glucose and fat metabolism in muscle in response to energy limitation ${ }^{67}$. Importantly, adiponectin levels rise during CR ${ }^{68}$, which suggests that this hormone might also have an important role in the physiological shift to insulin sensitivity in these animals.

WAT, calorie restriction and longevity. Does WAT have a decisive role in mediating the longevity that is engendered by CR? Although early studies suggested that fat was not important in determining the lifespan of rodents ${ }^{69,70}$, more recent findings show that mice that have been genetically engineered to be lean live longer. Indeed, tissue-specific knockout of the insulin receptor in WAT prevents the tissue from storing fat, which gives rise to lean animals that live significantly longer than wild-type mice ${ }^{71}$. Also, replacing the regulatory gene for fat metabolism, $C / E B P \alpha$ (CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein $\alpha$), with a second copy of its paralogue, $C / E B P \beta$, ${ }^{72}$ increases fat burning in WAT, thereby also generating lean animals that live longer.

An appealing model is that an alteration in fat storage in WAT changes the levels of hormones secreted, which programmes the organism for a different lifespan. It seems likely that a qualitative change in fat cells — for example, the reduction in size of white fat cells during CR — is required for this resetting of the levels of secreted hormones. Simply removing some of the fat, for example, by liposuction, should not deliver the same benefit, and might even make matters worse by causing an enlargement of the remaining fat cells ${ }^{73}$. Also, which WAT depot in the body is most affected might be a significant determinant of age-related decline in insulin function. Data suggest that the WAT depot in the viscera might be especially important in driving insulin resistance and pathogenesis ${ }^{74,75}$.

SIRT1 and fat Because of the possible connection between fat and CR, it was investigated whether SIRT1 had any role in the function of WAT. A critical regulator of WAT is the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)$\gamma$, which activates WAT-specific genes ${ }^{76}$. One PPAR$\gamma$ target, for example, is the $aP2$ gene, which encodes a protein that assists fat storage. Amazingly, SIRT1 was shown to be a repressor of PPAR$\gamma$, by docking to the negative cofactors of the nuclear receptor, and thereby downregulating genes such as the mouse $aP2$ gene (REF. 77). So, when mice were starved, SIRT1 was induced to bind the $aP2$ promoter in WAT, repress gene expression, and promote mobilization of fat into the blood. In a cell model for WAT, SIRT1 also repressed PPAR$\gamma$ and downregulated adipogenesis. So, we propose a pathway for CR that begins with the activation of SIRT1 in WAT by food scarcity, thereby reducing fat stores in this tissue and probably resetting hormonal levels to change the pace of ageing (FIG. 2). Two other recent reports show increases in SIRT1 protein levels in response to food deprivation ${ }^{78,79}$. It makes intuitive sense that mammals would use WAT as a way to sense whether food is abundant or scarce, and set the appropriate pace for ageing. This strategy also makes evolutionary sense when it is considered that reproduction is also regulated by body fat and is shut off during CR, only to resume when food becomes more plentiful. It will be interesting to see whether the extended reproductive period that is induced by CR ${ }^{4}$ is mediated by SIRT1 expression in germ cells and/or in cells that secrete hormones for reproduction.

Calorie restriction, insulin and disease Recent research indicates that changes in insulin and glucose metabolism are key indicators of ageing. The levels of many hormones decline as we get older (for example, growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF1)) but, by contrast, circulating insulin levels might actually increase in many individuals as they age ${ }^{80-83}$. This occurs because the tissues that respond to insulin to lower the blood sugar levels (mainly muscle and liver) become resistant to its action, leading to an increase in blood glucose and chronic stimulation of pancreatic $\beta$-cells, which produce more insulin in an attempt to maintain blood sugar at a normal level ${ }^{84}$. This HYPERINSULINAEMIA and HYPERGLYCAEMIA presage early type-2 diabetes. Chronic stimulation of pancreatic $\beta$-cells in these individuals will ultimately lead to these cells failing and, therefore, to diabetes.

In nematodes, an insulin-like signalling pathway figures prominently in lifespan regulation, and down-regulating this pathway leads to profound increases in longevity ${ }^{85,86}$. Several studies highlight the effects of CR on glucose metabolism. For example, calorie-restricted mice had glucose levels that were 20% lower and insulin levels that were 80% lower after a meal ${ }^{87}$. When the ratio of glucose to insulin was calculated, it was revealed that calorie-restricted mice have 3.3× greater insulin sensitivity than ad libitum mice ${ }^{87}$. The link between the accretion of fat in WAT and insulin resistance has also been

β-cells (the tissue that produces insulin). It will be important to determine how changes in these latter tissues are mediated by ageing and CR, and whether SIRT1 has any role in this process (FIG. 3).

### Calorie restriction and neurons

In addition to its effects on metabolism, CR can have profound effects on brain function. For example, CR can protect neurons against degeneration in animal models of Huntington’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease and stroke²¹. CR has also been reported to stimulate neurogenesis and enhance synaptic plasticity, which might increase the ability of the brain to resist cognitive decline²¹. Some of these changes in the brain that are triggered by ageing might be due to age-related oxidative damage to proteins and DNA. Indeed, ageing is accompanied by changes in gene expression, which define pathways that are involved in the oxidative-stress response and energy metabolism. Importantly, these changes were somehow mitigated by CR or intermittent fasting⁹⁰,⁹¹.

It is intriguing that a recent report has linked the activity of SIRT1 to the preservation of neuronal integrity. The WALLERIAN STRAIN OF MICE carries a spontaneous dominant mutation that stabilizes the axons of peripheral neurons from degeneration after neuronal damage⁹². This mutation increases the levels of an enzyme that is involved in NAD synthesis⁹³. Moreover, the neuroprotective effect in this strain seems to require SIRT1, which is upregulated by the change in NAD synthesis. It remains to be seen how the action of SIRT1 in the cell body protects axons, but it could be suggested that this sirtuin activates genes that encode protective proteins that move down axons (FIG. 4). It seems possible that CR also could exert beneficial changes in peripheral neurons through SIRT1 to preserve motor function with age.

**Figure 3 | Calorie restriction and metabolic changes.**

A physiological cycle that might be important during calorie restriction (CR) is initiated by a reduction in blood glucose due to lower calorie intake. This leads to a decrease in insulin production in the pancreatic β-cells and, consequently, a decrease in fat storage in white adipose tissue (WAT). The fat-depleted WAT then releases more adiponectin and less tumour necrosis factor (TNF)α. This endocrine change elicits greater insulin sensitivity in the metabolic tissues, such as muscle and liver, thereby further decreasing the levels of blood glucose.

shown. In one study, calorie-restricted rats, which are also very lean, had a significantly increased sensitivity to the action of insulin in their livers, compared with *ad libitum* controls⁸⁸.

However, the aetiology of insulin resistance is a subject that is under intense investigation and a complete understanding awaits further study⁸⁹. Other tissues besides WAT that are probably of central importance are the metabolic tissues, such as muscle and pancreatic

WALLERIAN STRAIN OF MICE  
A strain of mice that carries a spontaneous dominant mutation in the *Wld* locus that stabilizes the axons of peripheral neurons from degeneration after neuronal damage. The *Wld* locus is at a translocation that fuses the gene encoding ubiquitin fusion degradation protein 2a (UFD2a), a ubiquitin-chain-assembly factor, to the complete sequence of the nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase-1 (*Nmnat1*) gene. The resulting increase in NMNAT1 expression causes the phenotype.

**Figure 4 | SIRT1 and neuroprotection.** The figure shows a peripheral neuron and its associated axons. **a** | After neuronal damage, such as rupture between the main cell body and the axons, axons die rapidly, which leads to neurodegeneration. **b** | The Wallerian strain of mice carries a spontaneous genetic mutation that leads to the slowing down of neurodegeneration of peripheral neurons in response to damage. This mutation upregulates a gene that is involved in NAD synthesis, thereby increasing SIRT1 activity, which results in protection against neurodegeneration after damage. It is speculated that SIRT1 activates genes in the nucleus that encode proteins that travel down the axon and confer neuroprotection.

UNCOUPLING PROTEINS (UCPs). A family of mitochondrial-inner-membrane proteins. They allow the leakage of protons down the electrochemical gradient that is generated by respiration, thereby uncoupling oxygen consumption and ATP synthesis from the production of chemical energy.

BROWN ADIPOSE TISSUE  
A depot of fat cells that is used for thermogenesis in rodents; brown adipose tissue derives its colour from rich vascularization and densely packed mitochondria; these properties reflect its high metabolism of fat in response to cold exposure.

Calorie restriction and UCPs

So, CR exerts many physiological changes, some of which might be attributed to the action of SIRT1. For example, the maintenance of glucose homeostasis under low-calorie conditions might be a prerequisite for good health and longevity. But an understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which ageing can be slowed is incomplete. We now suggest a possible effect of UNCOUPLING PROTEINS (UCPs), which belong to a family of mitochondrial-inner-membrane proteins, on the generation of oxidative damage and ageing.

Respiration and the accompanying transport of electrons pump protons from the mitochondria to the cytoplasm, which generates a proton gradient with the energy of an electrical capacitor. The normal function of UCPs is to allow the leakage of protons down this electrochemical gradient without generating ATP, thereby uncoupling oxygen consumption from the production of chemical energy^{94–97}. Several mammalian UCP homologues have been identified and characterized^{96}. **UCP1** is found in BROWN ADIPOSE TISSUE and functions in thermogenesis to provide heat instead of ATP^{94}. **UCP2** is ubiquitous and has been proposed to have a role in lipid metabolism, insulin resistance, glucose utilization, regulation of ROS, and macrophage-mediated immunity^{96,98,99}. **UCP3** is another related protein and is expressed primarily in muscle^{100}. **UCP4** is a brain-specific protein, which might potentially influence nervous-system signalling or ROS generation^{101}. **UCP5** (or brain mitochondrial carrier protein-1 (BMCP1)) is abundant in the brain and might have a role in energy metabolism^{102–104}.

How might changes in UCPs affect cells? Mitochondria from UCP3-knockout mice show increased superoxide generation^{105,106}, which is an undesirable phenotype. Therefore, some degree of uncoupling might actually be beneficial to the animal. More specifically, UCPs might prevent hyper-polarization of the mitochondrial membrane (that is, the state with the steepest proton gradient between the cytoplasm and mitochondria). The difficulty of pumping protons against an already hyper-polarized membrane might cause the stalling of electrons in the electron-transport chain, which could generate ROS. By this view, any upregulation of UCPs might ameliorate the generation of oxidative damage by reducing ROS and thereby slowing ageing (FIG. 5). At first glance, one might expect UCP protein levels to decrease during CR to yield a more efficient production of chemical energy. However, it might be advantageous for calorie-restricted animals to actually use a greater portion of their energy to produce heat, because of their smaller size. Any upregulation of UCPs for this purpose might have the added benefit of reducing ROS and slowing ageing. One test of this idea would be to see whether the longevity that is induced by CR would be curtailed by keeping animals under thermoneutral conditions.

A recent study showed a positive correlation between lifespan and the degree of such uncoupling in mice^{107}. So do levels of UCPs actually change during CR? In fact, there are several reports that UCPs might increase during CR, but the data are conflicting. CR and short-term fasting have been shown to upregulate lung UCP2^{108,109}, whereas re-feeding caused a rapid decline in UCP2 expression, which suggests that the factors that regulate UCP2 expression respond to changes in food intake. It is also reported that free fatty acids can upregulate UCP2 expression^{110–113}. Since CR causes an increase in aerobic

metabolism and the utilization of free fatty acids, increases in UCP2 during CR might not be surprising<sup>109,114</sup>. In starved rats, there was a fivefold increase in UCP3 mRNA expression in the soleus muscle, however after one week of CR the levels of UCP3 again declined<sup>100</sup>. Furthermore, UCP2 and UCP3 protein levels were reported to increase in the mitochondria of skeletal muscle after food deprivation<sup>115,116</sup>. Clearly, more research is needed to determine the importance of what could be a fascinating link between UCPs and the benefits of CR.

**Concluding remarks**

The basis of understanding CR and how it regulates ageing might well come from combining our understanding of mammalian metabolic pathways with recent genetic findings in lower organisms. In this regard, we can begin to integrate the known effects of CR on mammalian physiology with our burgeoning understanding of how the key regulator SIRT1 functions in various tissues. Fat-storage tissues, metabolic tissues and insulin-producing cells provide an early test of the importance of SIRT1 in mediating CR. Recent findings of an important role for SIRT1 in fat metabolism are encouraging, but it will be crucial to ascertain a comprehensive picture in all of the relevant tissues. In this regard, it will be important to test models in mutant mice in which SIRT1 function has been altered. It seems likely that a molecular understanding of CR will have direct implications for new approaches to treat metabolic diseases, such as diabetes and obesity.
