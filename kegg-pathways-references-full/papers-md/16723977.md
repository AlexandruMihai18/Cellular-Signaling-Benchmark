# Early nonsense: mRNA decay solves a translational problem

**Nadia Amrani**, **Matthew S. Sachs** and **Allan Jacobson**

**Abstract** | Gene expression is highly accurate and rarely generates defective proteins. Several mechanisms ensure this fidelity, including specialized surveillance pathways that rid the cell of mRNAs that are incompletely processed or that lack complete open reading frames. One such mechanism, nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, is triggered when ribosomes encounter a premature translation-termination — or nonsense — codon. New evidence indicates that the specialized factors that are recruited for this process not only promote rapid mRNA degradation, but are also required to resolve a poorly dissociable termination complex.

### Nonsense codon
An alternative name for the codons that do not designate the insertion of a specific amino acid during protein synthesis in the standard genetic code. Since UAA, UAG and UGA also promote the termination of protein synthesis, these three codons have also been termed ‘stop’ codons.

Given the overall congruity of gene expression mechanisms from yeast to humans, and the obvious need for quality control, it comes as no surprise that the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway is active in all eukaryotes that have been examined, and that the three core factors of this pathway are highly conserved. However, these similarities notwithstanding, NMD in higher eukaryotes seems to require several factors that are not present in yeast and has been thought to incorporate splicing-dependent mechanisms that are probably not operative in organisms with few intron-containing genes. Therefore, existing models for the respective mechanisms of NMD in yeast and mammalian cells are not easily reconciled. To address this problem, we propose a model for NMD in yeast in which the underlying mechanism that causes an mRNA to become an NMD substrate is compatible with mRNA processing, translation and degradative activities in all eukaryotes. Key elements of this model address why some termination events, but not others, can trigger NMD and consider functions for the NMD factors in both translation termination and mRNA decay, as well as the role of sequences that are located 3′ to the nonsense codon in promoting NMD.

### An mRNA ‘life cycle’ and its untimely endings
Eukaryotic translation-competent mRNAs are typically generated by a multi-step combination of transcription, processing, nuclear export and messenger ribonucleoprotein particle (mRNP) maturation. Once in the cytoplasm, translation of the mRNP ensues as it forms a closed-loop structure that links the 5′ and 3′ ends of the mRNA, associates with the requisite translation-initiation factors, and binds to a 40S ribosomal subunit that is itself replete with the initiator methionyl transfer RNA and additional factors¹⁻⁶ (FIG. 1). The recognition of the initiator codon (generally, the AUG codon) and the subsequent joining of a 60S ribosomal subunit complete the initiation phase of protein synthesis and create an 80S composite ribosome that decodes each nucleotide triplet and elongates a fledgling polypeptide chain until a UAA, UAG or UGA nonsense (or stop) codon is encountered. For conventional mRNAs (that is, those with complete open reading frames (ORFs)), nonsense-codon recognition promotes polypeptide hydrolysis, ribosome release and, possibly, the recycling of the ribosome to the 5′ end of the same mRNA⁷⁻¹¹. These termination events are catalysed by two release factors, eRF1 and eRF3, and are enhanced by the interaction of eRF3 with poly(A)-binding protein (PABP), a highly conserved polypeptide that associates with the 3′ poly(A) tail that is present on almost all eukaryotic mRNAs¹²⁻¹⁸.

Termination can also occur prematurely; for example, in transcripts that are derived from genes that harbour nonsense mutations or in which errors in transcription or processing have created a nonsense codon. In such transcripts, the recognition of an ‘early’ nonsense codon not only aborts protein synthesis, but also triggers the rapid degradation of the mRNA by the NMD pathway¹⁹⁻²¹. This quality-control system ensures that potentially toxic polypeptide fragments do not accumulate²² while simultaneously coping with possible translational logjams that might arise from the inherent inefficiency of premature translation termination²³.

Not all NMD substrates are defective transcripts that are generated as a consequence of mutations or synthesis errors. The NMD pathway also affects a large number of endogenous substrates, including: inefficiently spliced pre-mRNAs that enter the cytoplasm with their introns intact, mRNAs in which the ribosome has bypassed the initiator AUG and commenced

Figure 1 | The mRNA ‘life cycle’ in the cytoplasm. The cytoplasmic utilization and elimination of a newly synthesized mRNA involves five different stages. **1** | Poly(A)-binding protein (Pab1 in yeast) and cap-binding protein (eIF4E) associate with the mRNA. **2** | The interaction of Pab1 with translation initiation factor eIF4G promotes the formation of the ‘closed loop’, initiates translation and antagonizes decapping. In this step, eIF4G interacts with other initiation factors, eIF4E, eIF3 and eIF4A, to facilitate the binding of the 40S ribosomal subunit to the mRNA, 5′-to-3′ scanning and AUG recognition. Joining of the 60S subunit and subsequent translational elongation require additional factors (not shown). **3** | Translation termination by an 80S ribosome is promoted by the recognition of the UAG codon in the ribosomal aminoacyl (A) site by the release factor eRF1 and stimulated by interactions between eRF1 and a second release factor, eRF3, and between eRF3 and Pab1. **4** | The poly(A) tail of the mRNA is shortened by the 3′-to-5′ exonucleolytic activities of the deadenylase complex CCR4-NOT, a process that continues through multiple rounds of translation of the mRNA. Poly(A) shortening, in turn, minimizes the number of Pab1 molecules that are associated with the 3′-untranslated region of the mRNA, ultimately disrupting the closed loop and initiating the conversion of the mRNP to a state in which it will become accessible to the Dcp1-Dcp2 decapping enzyme complex. **5** | Loss of the poly(A) tail and Pab1 facilitate an mRNP rearrangement in which the dissociation of eIF4E from the 5′ cap and the binding of the Lsm1–7–Pat1–Dhh1 complex stimulates Dcp1-Dcp2-mediated decapping. After decapping, the mRNA is degraded by the 5′-to-3′ exonuclease Xrn1. Alternatively, the deadenylated transcript can become a substrate for the 3′-to-5′ exonucleolytic activities of the exosome. It is not known whether a decapped transcript can also become an exosome substrate. The events of step 5 might take place at specific subcellular sites known as P bodies (not shown).

translation further downstream, some mRNAs that contain upstream open reading frames (uORFs), mRNAs that are subject to frameshifting or that are generated by alternative splicing, bicistronic mRNAs, mRNAs with abnormal extensions of their 3′-untranslated regions (3′-UTRs), and transcripts of pseudogenes, transposable elements, and genes that are subject to programmed rearrangements^{24-29}. In all cases, however, the status of these endogenous transcripts as NMD substrates can be accounted for by the occurrence of premature translation termination or a termination event that is functionally equivalent to premature termination^{24,25}.

Box 1 | Translation termination in eukaryotes

The termination of protein synthesis occurs when an elongating ribosome encounters an in-frame UAA, UAG or UGA nonsense (or stop) codon located at the end of a coding region in the mRNA that is being translated. This complex event involves two classes of release factors (RFs). Class I RFs recognize stop codons within the ribosomal aminoacyl (A) site and trigger the hydrolysis of the ester bond that connects the polypeptide chain and the transfer RNA in the peptidyl (P) site. In prokaryotes, RF1 decodes UAA and UAG stop codons, whereas RF2 is specific for UAA and UGA. The genetic code of mitochondria and mycoplasmas is different and does not contain the UGA stop codon. Consequently, they possess only one RF that corresponds to bacterial RF1 (REF. 128). In eukaryotes, a single factor, designated eRF1 (Sup45 in yeast), decodes all three stop codons and acts as a class I RF<sup>12</sup>. Class II RFs are GTPases that stimulate class I RF activity and confer GTP dependency upon the termination process. In eukaryotes, eRF3 acts as the class II RF (Sup35 in yeast). GTP hydrolysis is required to couple eRF1 recognition of the termination signal in mRNA to efficient polypeptide-chain release, therefore indicating that discrimination of sense from nonsense codons by eRF1 mimics the recognition of a cognate codon by a tRNA. In addition to its interaction with eRF1, eRF3 interacts with the poly(A)-binding protein (PABP, or Pab1 in yeast; see FIG. 1, step 3). Interactions between cytoplasmic PABP and eRF3 have been observed in yeast, frog and mammalian cells<sup>15–17,105</sup> and influence translation termination and mRNA decay.

Conventional mRNA degradation. Conventional transcripts initiate their demise concurrently with the onset of their translation. Like a commuter ticket that is intended for a fixed number of train rides, the poly(A) tail of the mRNA is continually shortened during the translation process until a critical minimum length has been reached<sup>3,5,30</sup>. In lower eukaryotes this length seems to be 10–12 adeny late residues, whereas in metazoans it can be twice that size<sup>31–34</sup>. This shortening minimizes the available binding sites for PABP, thereby altering the closed-loop structure of the translated mRNP. In turn, the mRNP begins a transition to a new state in which the binding of additional proteins prompts the loss of the cap-binding initiation-factor complex, promotes distinct mRNA decay pathways, and determines the subcellular sites of their occurrence<sup>3,35–38</sup>.

Two functionally redundant mechanisms degrade all conventional mRNAs: the decapping-dependent 5′-to-3′ pathway and the exosome-mediated 3′-to-5′ pathway<sup>3,32,35,39,40</sup> (FIG. 1). In the 5′-to-3′ decay pathway, the mRNP rearrangement that is brought on by poly(A) shortening facilitates the binding of factors — for example, the components of the Lsm1–7-Pat1-Dhh1 complex — that seems to promote the interaction of the mRNP with the Dcp1–Dcp2 decapping enzyme complex<sup>36,41</sup>. Once decapped, the transcript is degraded exonucleolytically by the Xrn1 5′-to-3′ exonuclease. Alternatively, in the 3′-to-5′ decay pathway, transcripts are further deadenylated and then degraded by a ten-subunit 3′-to-5′ exonuclease complex, known as the exosome, and their capped ends are eliminated by the scavenger decapping enzyme Dcps<sup>35,42–44</sup>.

NMD regulators control termination and decay The first significant clues to the mechanism of NMD were obtained from the characterization of specialized factors that are essential for NMD activity. Factors that regulate NMD were originally identified in yeast and include the interacting proteins that are encoded by the highly conserved but non-essential UPF1, NMD2 (also known as UPF2) and UPF3 genes<sup>57–62</sup> (BOX 2). Even though each protein is required for the destabilization of nonsense-containing mRNAs, their functions are not limited to mRNA decay. Mutations in these three genes cause 5–20-fold decreases in the decay rates of yeast nonsense-containing mRNAs and, simultaneously, cause nonsense suppression (that is, they cause the read-through of premature termination codons)<sup>59,63–67</sup>. Nonsense suppression is highest in cells that lack UPF1 activity, and

Upstream open reading frame (uORF). Most mRNAs contain a single open reading frame (ORF); that is, an AUG start codon, followed by a sizeable number of in-frame codons that designate specific amino acids, followed by a termination codon. In some mRNAs, the ORF is preceded by one or more small ORFs, designated uORFs.

Bicistronic mRNA Also known as dicistronic mRNA. An mRNA that contains two independently translated open reading frames (two cistrons) that are typically non-overlapping.

Untranslated regions (UTRs). The segments of mRNA that do not usually code for proteins, namely the 5′ segment that precedes the start codon, which is used for translational initiation (5′-UTR), and the 3′ segment that follows the nonsense codon, which signals normal translation termination (3′-UTR). Internal segments of mRNAs can become *de facto* 3′-UTRs if preceded by a premature termination codon.

Pseudogene A segment of DNA in the genome that resembles a functional gene but is not functional because of the absence of appropriate regulatory sequences or a complete open reading frame.

Decapping The process of removing the 5′ cap structure from an mRNA, usually as a step prior to further 5′-to-3′ exonucleolytic digestion of the remainder of the mRNA. In yeast, decapping is catalysed by the Dcp1–Dcp2 complex, of which Dcp2 is thought to be the catalytic component.

Exosome A complex of exonucleases that functions in the nucleus and cytoplasm to degrade several classes of RNA (including pre-mRNA, pre-ribosomal RNA and mRNA) from the 3′ end.

Box 2 | Regulators of NMD

Factors that regulate nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) were originally identified in screens for translational suppressors or two-hybrid interactors with known factors and are principally those encoded by the UPF1, NMD2 (also known as UPF2) and UPF3 genes. These genes have been characterized extensively and are conserved in all eukaryotic species that have been examined. In yeast, UPF1 encodes a 109-kD protein with seven conserved motifs that are common to members of the helicase superfamily I (REF. 106). Purified Upf1 has RNA-binding as well as RNA-dependent ATPase and RNA-helicase activities. An N-terminal zinc-finger-like domain of Upf1 interacts with a C-terminal domain of Nmd2, an acidic 127-kD protein with multiple domains that are homologous to segments of the initiation factor eIF4G. In turn, a so-called MIF4G domain in the C-terminal half of Nmd2 interacts with Upf3, a basic 45-kD protein. Upf1 also interacts with the polypeptide release factors Sup35 (yeast eRF3) and Sup45 (yeast eRF1), whereas Nmd2 and Upf3 interact only with Sup35 (REFS 57,69,129).

Mutations in other genes in yeast that encode translation factors, RNA-binding proteins and RNA-processing components (such as PRT1, HRP1, MOF2, MOF5, MOF8 and DBP2) also result in the selective stabilization of nonsense-containing mRNAs. In worms and other multicellular organisms, regulators of NMD include SMG1–7, of which SMG2, SMG3 and SMG4 are orthologues of UPF1, NMD2 and UPF3, respectively<sup>52</sup>. The other SMG proteins seem to be regulators of the phosphorylation status of SMG3 (REFS 130,131). Mammalian NMD is also regulated by numerous protein components of the exon junction complex (EJC), but an understanding of the potential role of these factors is complicated by the observation that their homologues in *Drosophila melanogaster* are not essential for NMD.

experiments that indicate that NMD can be antagonized by drugs or mutations that interfere with protein synthesis<sup>76,77</sup> and by tRNAs or altered release factors that suppress termination<sup>66,78,79</sup>. Collectively, these observations go beyond merely indicating a connection between the processes of NMD and translation. They demonstrate that the presence of a premature termination codon within a transcript is not sufficient to promote its rapid degradation. The transcript must also be translated and the nonsense codon must be recognized by the translational apparatus.

A recent study of NMD-promoted destabilization of the yeast **CPA1** mRNA has led to a further elaboration of these rules<sup>80</sup>. CPA1 encodes the small subunit of Arg-specific carbamoyl phosphate synthetase, and expression of its mRNA is subject to negative translational regulation by the Arg attenuator peptide (AAP). The AAP is encoded by a uORF of the CPA1 mRNA and regulation occurs when the nascent AAP responds to Arg by stalling ribosomes at the uORF termination codon, thereby reducing downstream translation initiation (FIG. 2). AAP-mediated stalling also promotes NMD of the CPA1 mRNA, accelerating its decay rate by more than two-fold.

Using CPA1–LUC reporter transcripts that harbour wild-type uORFs or uORFs that encompass mutations that inactivate AAP stalling, Gaba *et al.* determined how uORFs govern NMD. They demonstrated that wild-type uORFs stall ribosomes efficiently and are efficient triggers of NMD, whereas a mutated uORF (D13N), which stalls ribosomes poorly or not at all, is an inefficient trigger. Changing the AUG-flanking sequences to improve the initiation context of the uORF led to efficient NMD triggering by both the wild-type and the D13N uORFs, and these effects were not attributable to ribosome stalling in the latter case. Instead, the NMD-inducing effects of the context-improved D13N uORF were due to the increased ribosomal occupancy of the uORF termination codon. In a related finding, binding of the *Caenorhabditis elegans* GLD-1 protein (an RNA-binding protein) to a uORF-containing target mRNA was shown to decrease uORF translation, and therefore decrease NMD<sup>81</sup>.

Both studies therefore show that the levels of ribosomes that are present at an early stop codon can control NMD (FIG. 2) and a corollary of this conclusion, as discussed below, is that events and factors that alter mRNA ‘translatability’ should also affect NMD. The data of Gaba *et al.* also indicate that early termination of translation on the CPA1 mRNA and/or the subsequent triggering of NMD must be inefficient, a conclusion that is consistent with recent studies<sup>23</sup> which show that premature termination is considerably less efficient than normal termination (see below).

the overexpression of UPF1 can compensate for the loss of NMD2 or UPF3, but not vice versa<sup>63</sup>. So, Upf1 seems to have a crucial role in promoting the fidelity of premature termination that is regulated by Nmd2 and Upf3. Consistent with these relationships, Upf1, Nmd2 and Upf3 are present at ~1,600, 160 and 80 molecules per yeast cell, respectively, levels that underscore the importance of Upf1 yet minimize the probability that these proteins can be associated with all ribosomes or function as a stoichiometric complex<sup>63</sup>.

The low cellular levels of Upf1, Nmd2 and Upf3, as well as the maintenance of normal growth rates in *upf1Δ*, *nmd2Δ* and *upf3Δ* mutant cells<sup>58,59,61,62</sup>, also imply that these factors probably do not have significant roles in normal termination. Nevertheless, *in vitro* binding experiments demonstrate that the release factor **Sup35** (yeast eRF3) bridges these factors to the termination complex. Upf1, Nmd2 and Upf3 all interact with Sup35, and Upf1 can also interact with a second release factor, **Sup45** (yeast eRF1)<sup>68–70</sup>. Sup35 has a unique Upf1-binding domain, but Nmd2, Upf3 and Sup45 all compete for binding to Sup35 and might therefore share a common interaction domain<sup>70</sup>. These interactions notwithstanding, the role of the Upf and Nmd proteins in premature termination must be distinct from the roles of the release factors, because nonsense suppression by *sup35* and *sup45* mutations is additive to that caused by *upf* and *nmd* mutations in yeast<sup>66</sup>.

Deadenylation

The process of shortening of the 3′ poly(A) tail that is present on most eukaryotic mRNAs. Although many deadenylases have been described, the principal cytoplasmic activity in yeast seems to be from the CCR4–NOT complex.

Nonsense suppression

A term that is used to describe the failure of the ribosome to terminate at a nonsense codon and instead to read through it as if the insertion of an amino acid had been specified. Often, the amino acid that is inserted arises from a ‘near cognate transfer RNA’, that is, one in which two of three codon–anti-codon base pairs are still in place.

Polysome

Also known as polyribosome. It is a complex with two or more ribosomes that are associated with an mRNA.

NMD severity and ribosomal occupancy

The detection of interactions between NMD factors and release factors, as well as a role for NMD factors in the fidelity of premature termination, implies that NMD and translation are interconnected. This supposition was previously bolstered by the localization of NMD factors and decay intermediates to polysomes<sup>27,71–76</sup>, and by

Premature translation termination is aberrant

Premature and normal termination are often lumped together when considering termination as a biochemical event, but the action of NMD indicates that this should not be so. The possibility that premature termination differs from normal termination was recently addressed

in a series of experiments that used *in vitro* translation in yeast cell-free extracts combined with analyses of ribosome positioning by toeprinting (a technique that involves primer extension inhibition; BOX 3)²³. In these experiments, ribosomes that encountered a premature termination codon failed to be released and yielded toeprint signals that corresponded to their stalling when the ribosomal aminoacyl (A) site was positioned on a nonsense codon. Normal termination codons did not yield any toeprint signals unless Sup45 was defective, which implies that normal terminators have a higher level of termination efficiency than premature terminators²³. The addition of the elongation inhibitor cycloheximide to translation reactions also failed to elicit toeprints from normal terminators, but did generate additional toeprints in close proximity to premature nonsense codons. These toeprints, derived from 80S ribosomes with AUG codons in their peptidyl (P) sites, arose when ribosomes that encountered premature termination codons (but not normal termination codons) failed to be released and instead reinitiated translation predominantly, but not exclusively, 5′ to the premature terminator. Regardless of the site of post-termination reinitiation, premature stop codons had to be recognized by Sup45 and peptide hydrolysis had to be triggered prior to any reinitiation event could occur²³.

Collectively, these experiments show that premature termination and normal termination are distinct biochemical processes. At a minimum, ribosome release that results from premature termination is dramatically less efficient, thereby allowing both backwards ('retro') and conventional reinitiation of translation. Moreover, since the aberrant toeprints that are characteristic of retro-reinitiation were largely lacking in extracts from *upf1Δ* or *nmd2Δ* mutant cells, these experiments showed that the inactivation or absence of NMD factors might preclude or perturb events that regulate ribosome stability and movements at a premature termination codon²³.

### The 3′-UTR affects termination-codon function

In light of the closed-loop structure of cytoplasmic mRNPs, it is not surprising that 3′-UTRs serve as binding sites for numerous factors that regulate mRNA translation or stability⁸²⁻⁸⁶. If subsets of such factors have a role in normal termination, for example, by influencing the activity of the release factors, there is the possibility that the mRNA sequence that is distal to a premature terminator, which forms an unconventional 3′-UTR, will not be the functional equivalent of a normal 3′-UTR. This principal tenet of the 'faux (false) UTR' model¹⁹,²³,⁸⁷ explains the inadequacy of the sequence context of premature terminators by indicating that proximity to the poly(A) tail (and its bound Pab1, yeast PABP) has a qualitative and/or quantitative influence on the nature of the regulatory proteins that associate with the 3′-UTR (see below).

Alternatively, an initial round of translation that reaches the normal end of a coding region could remodel an mRNP productively; that is, promote the exchange of one set of mRNA-associated proteins for

Box 3 | Toeprinting analysis

Precise mapping of the positions of ribosomes and associated factors on mRNAs is important for understanding the fundamental processes that occur during translation, from initiation to termination. The toeprinting technique directly identifies the position of the 40S ribosomal subunit or the 80S ribosome on the mRNA<sup>132–135</sup>. The technique is based on the inhibition of primer extension by reverse transcriptase (RT). Using a labelled oligonucleotide that hybridizes 3′ to the region of interest of an mRNA, reverse transcriptase extends the primer and synthesizes complementary DNA from the site of primer binding toward the 5′ end of the mRNA. When the reverse transcriptase meets the ribosome (or associated factor) bound to the mRNA, polymerization is halted and a cDNA toeprint fragment is generated. Its size is then determined on high-resolution polyacrylamide gels. When used for the analysis of protein-synthesis initiation, the arrest of reverse transcriptase always occurs at the same positions, approximately 16 nt 3′ of the A in the AUG initiation codon (see figure; top). However, this toeprint is only observed when the aminoacylated transfer RNA forms a codon–anti-codon interaction with the mRNA in the peptidyl (P) site of the 40S ribosomal subunit or 80S ribosome. At termination codons, the cessation of reverse transcription can be detected approximately 13 nt downstream of the U of the termination codon (see figure; bottom). This spacing is consistent with ribosomes that have paused with the terminator codon in the ribosomal aminoacyl (A) site.

A probable role for 3′-UTR-associated factors in the antagonism of NMD is also indicated by two additional sets of experiments. Weil and Beemon<sup>91</sup> have recently shown that the stability of unspliced Rous sarcoma virus RNA is dependent on a specific sequence element that is located just downstream of the termination codon for the gag ORF (which encodes the protein of the nucleocapsid shell around the retroviral RNA) and that insertion of the same sequence element 3′ to a premature termination codon in the gag gene was sufficient to inhibit NMD of the transcript<sup>91</sup>. Similarly, the four uORFs of the yeast GCN4 mRNA (encoding a transcriptional activator) are followed by a stabilizer element that antagonizes NMD, possibly as a direct consequence of its association with the RNA-binding protein Pab1 (REFS 77,92).

### The downstream sequence dilemma

The deletion and tethering experiments discussed above imply that sequences downstream of premature terminators are inadequate binding sites for the key factors bound to 3′-UTRs that allow normal translation termination. However, an alternative, popular and reasonable interpretation postulates that the dependence of NMD on sequences 3′ to premature terminators does not come from the absence of an adjacent proper 3′-UTR, but instead comes from the localization of NMD-promoting factors to improper 3′-UTRs. This implies that coding regions of mRNAs ought to share a common sequence element or structure. Indeed, early experiments in yeast indicated that, in addition to needing a premature nonsense codon, destabilization by NMD required specific downstream elements (DSEs)<sup>89,93</sup>. This conclusion was initially based on the stabilization of nonsense-containing PGK1 mRNAs (which encode phosphoglycerate kinase) by the deletion of most of the protein-coding region downstream of the early nonsense codon and by the reactivation of NMD in such altered mRNAs by the reinsertion of small coding-region segments of *PGK1* (REF. 89). Further analyses of DSEs in other yeast mRNAs indicated that they could activate the NMD pathway when located within ~150 nt of the stop codon, but were not functional unless they were preceded by a termination codon or traversed by translating ribosomes<sup>77,92</sup>. What complicated matters, however, was the observation that DSE sequences from diverse yeast mRNAs had only a weak sequence consensus<sup>89,93–95</sup>. Studies of mammalian NMD substrates also revealed a similar lack of a consensus DSE sequences, but showed that destabilization required an exon–exon junction at least 50 nt downstream of the premature terminator<sup>96</sup>.

Two models made sense of this requirement for apparently featureless sequences that promote NMD. The ‘surveillance complex’ model<sup>69,97</sup> for yeast NMD indicated that the DSE was the site of deposition of specific proteins (for example, the shuttling RNA-binding protein Hrp1) during early processing events, and that the presence of these proteins facilitated the recruitment of Upf1, Upf3 and Nmd2, and the activation of NMD on mRNAs that contained premature terminators. mRNAs with intact ORFs were therefore thought to avoid NMD because the relevant factors would be swept off by the first traversing ribosome to deprive an mRNA of its translational virginity.

could regain their status as NMD substrates once the
NMD apparatus was functional<sup>87</sup>. In the second experiment, analyses of the competition between NMD and
nonsense-codon read-through was carried out using
all three nonsense codons (BOX 1) in several different
contexts, which resulted in a nearly 300-fold variation
in the efficiency of termination. This indicated that
the maximal level of NMD occurred when nonsense-
codon read-through was at or below a threshold of 0.5%
(REF. 66). Clearly, a reduction in the rate of NMD that is
caused by read-through by as few as one ribosome in
100 implies there are multiple translation events on the
mRNA that is subject to NMD. In the third approach,
the supplementation of culture media with Arg was
shown to lead to the immediate induction of NMD of
CPA1 mRNAs that had been synthesized and translated
well in advance of NMD induction<sup>80</sup>. Collectively, these
three sets of results are consistent with the idea that yeast
nonsense-containing transcripts are never immune to
NMD and raise questions about models that suggest that
NMD in yeast depends on early rounds of translation.
These experiments do not, however, exclude the possibility that mammalian transcripts follow different rules
and are subject to NMD only during an initial round of
translation<sup>103</sup>.

**The faux UTR model for NMD**

All the aforementioned idiosyncrasies of NMD in yeast
can be addressed by the *faux* UTR model<sup>19,23,87</sup>. In this
model, premature termination and normal termination
are considered to be biochemically different events, with
premature termination creating two substantial problems
for the well-being of the cell: the synthesis and eventual
accumulation of potentially toxic polypeptide fragments,
and the involvement of a portion of the cell’s ribosomes
and translation factors in an aberrant and inefficient
termination event. Aberrant termination at a premature
nonsense codon is thought to allow the binding of the
NMD factors to the ribosome and therefore to trigger
mRNA decay. By contrast, the proper termination of
translation and normal rates of mRNA decay are postulated to result from interactions between a terminating
ribosome and a specific mRNP structure or set of factors localized 3′ to the stop codon that is dependent on
proximal Pab1 for its presence or activity<sup>19,23,54,88,104</sup>. The
*faux* UTR model for NMD derives its name from the
concept that the downstream sequences that were originally proposed to promote NMD by specific recruitment
of factors actually do so because they do not promote the
functions of authentic 3′-UTRs. That is, in the *faux* UTR
model, premature termination is thought to be aberrant
because it occurs in the absence of a regulatory factor
(or factors) that are normally present on a legitimate
3′-UTR.

The hypothetical events that accompany either normal or premature termination in yeast are summarized
in FIG. 4. Normal termination (FIG. 4a) is thought to be
dependent on Sup35 and Sup45, as well as on proximal
Pab1 that is typically associated with a proper 3′-UTR. As suggested by several groups, an interaction between
Sup35 and Pab1 might enhance termination efficiency

Figure 4 | Proposed mechanistic differences between normal and premature translation termination in yeast. In normal termination (a), the ribosome harbouring a nascent polypeptide approaches the UAG termination codon (top), engages the UAG codon in the ribosomal aminoacyl (A) site, binds the release factors Sup45 and Sup35, and releases the completed polypeptide (middle). The ribosome subunits are released from the mRNA and made available for another round of translation on either the same mRNA or another mRNA (bottom). Normal termination is thought to be highly efficient, in part because interactions between Pab1 (the yeast poly(A)-binding protein) and ribosome-associated Sup35 enhance the ability of Sup35 to stimulate the activity of Sup45. The spatial relationships of Pab1 and the termination site are exaggerated, but are meant to indicate that the effect of Pab1 depends on its proximity to the termination event. In premature termination (b), a ribosome harbouring a nascent polypeptide approaches a premature UAG termination codon (top); it engages the UAG codon in its A site, binds Sup45 and Sup35, and fails to release the incomplete polypeptide (middle). Subsequently, the NMD factors Upf1, Nmd2 and Upf3 bind to the release factors, stimulating peptide hydrolysis and 60S ribosomal subunit dissociation (bottom). The association of the NMD factors with the ribosome is postulated to facilitate the recruitment of the Dcp1–Dcp2 decapping enzyme complex to the mRNA, by virtue of the interaction of Dcp2 with Upf1, and to promote mRNA decapping. Premature termination is thought to be inefficient because the termination site lacks proximal Pab1 and/or other factors that are associated with a natural 3′-UTR.

by the presence of proximal Pab1, possibly because the affinity of Pab1 for Sup35 might exceed that of the Upf and Nmd factors, or because Pab1 is also mediating other interactions that facilitate the termination process. The latter possibility also allows for Pab1 to be involved from greater distances in some UTRs.

By contrast, premature termination (FIG. 4b) is postulated to be characterized by the absence of proximal Pab1 (or another factor that is dependent on Pab1 for binding), which, in turn, is then thought to reduce the efficiency of termination and to allow the low-abundance Upf and Nmd factors to associate with this relatively rare form of the termination complex. Although not depicted in FIG. 4, Nmd2 and Upf3 might be the first NMD factors to bind to Sup35, and therefore facilitate Upf1 binding to Sup35 and Sup45 (REF. 70). Moreover, although aberrant termination seems to slow ribosome release and facilitate the reinitiation of translation, reinitiation is considered only a symptom of aberrant termination²³, not a cause of NMD. But reinitiation does indicate a possible novel role for the RNA-helicase activity of Upf1 (see below).

Three distinct functions are predicted for the association of the yeast Upf and Nmd factors with the prematurely terminating ribosome. First, the efficiency of peptide hydrolysis is thought to be enhanced, a conclusion that follows from observations that the absence of these factors promotes nonsense suppression⁶³,⁶⁵. Second, the RNA-helicase activity of Upf1 (REFS 106,107) (a rather neglected attribute in most models) is thought to promote the dissociation of the 60S ribosomal subunit, leaving its 40S partner with the opportunity to reinitiate translation and possibly be ultimately liberated by a downstream normal termination event. Third, the N-terminal zinc-finger domain of Upf1, which is known to interact with Dcp2 (REFS 62,108), is postulated to recruit the decapping enzyme complex (Dcp1–Dcp2) and promote decapping, thereby rendering the transcript susceptible to 5′-to-3′ decay (decapping by Dcp1–Dcp2 and subsequent exonucleolytic digestion are not shown in FIG. 4). These functions for Upf1 are consistent with the existence of mutations and high-copy suppressors that appear to separate the translation and mRNA decay activities of Upf1(REFS 63–65).

The model does not exclude the possibility that weaker interactions between Upf1, Nmd2 or Upf3 and other mRNA decay factors, such as the deadenylase and the exosome, can stimulate additional modes of decay. Moreover, although the decapping and exonucleolytic events of NMD might occur in discrete subcellular sites, designated P bodies³⁷,¹⁰⁹, such localization is not specified in the model, largely because the precise site of these events does not affect the overall outline of the key steps in NMD.

Possible similarity of yeast and mammalian NMD

The pathways of gene expression in higher and lower eukaryotes are strikingly similar mechanistically, and the respective factors that have key roles in transcription, RNA processing and export, translation and mRNA decay are highly conserved. How then could it be that

and ensure efficient ribosome release and recycling (possibly to the 5′ end of the same mRNA)¹⁵,¹⁷,¹⁸,¹⁰⁵. Even though the Upf and Nmd factors can interact with Sup35 (REF. 70), we suggest that this interaction can be precluded

P body (Processing body). A site within the cytoplasm that localizes the processes of RNA metabolism and inactivation, including RNA degradation and silencing. mRNA that is sequestered in P bodies is not available for translation.

the pioneer round model, the prevalent explanation for metazoan NMD, could differ so significantly from the faux UTR model that applies to yeast? In the pioneer round model, the EJC serves as a protein complex that not only signals the position of a nearby splicing event, but, if necessary, also provides factors that are essential for the promotion of NMD²⁰. Consistent with these notions, NMD in mammalian cells requires an intron downstream of a premature terminator, and the depletion of EJC components or reductions in splicing efficiencies antagonize NMD²⁰,¹⁰¹,¹¹⁰–¹¹⁴. However, recent studies indicate that EJC factors also have important roles in establishing the translatability of the mature mRNP¹¹³,¹¹⁵–¹¹⁷. For example, Nott *et al.* showed that mRNAs that are derived from intronless β-globin primary transcripts associate with smaller polysomes than those derived from intron-containing pre-mRNAs, and that tethered EJC factors can restore the translational efficiency of transcripts otherwise devoid of EJCs¹¹⁵. Related studies from Gudikote *et al.* showed that the translational yield of efficiently spliced T-cell receptor-β (TCRβ) mRNAs was considerably greater than that derived from transcripts in which splicing was impaired¹¹³. These results demonstrate that mRNAs derived from mRNP maturation pathways from which EJC components are lacking are markedly deficient in translational activity. Given that NMD in mammalian cells, like that in yeast, is translation dependent¹¹⁸, the apparent NMD requirement for the EJC might principally be a function of its translational-stimulatory activity; that is, events and factors that alter mRNA translatability should also affect NMD¹¹³.

So, rather than being crucial mRNA decay factors, the components of the EJC, similar to other determinants of translational efficiency, can also be thought of as modulators of the severity of NMD. This hypothesis is consistent with results from recent studies, which indicate that EJC factors are dispensable for NMD in *D. melanogaster*¹¹⁹–¹²¹. If the EJC need not be thought of as a direct activator of NMD, the opportunity arises for the consideration of metazoan NMD in the same terms as yeast NMD; it is a solution to a translational problem that is generated by inefficient termination. It fixes the problem and simultaneously reduces the cellular abundance of the offending transcripts. It remains to be seen whether adherence to such a programme in metazoans follows the pathway outlined by the faux UTR model, but several recent experiments support this possibility; in *D. melanogaster*, proximal tethered PABP can neutralize the mRNA-destabilizing effect of a premature termination codon (E. Izaurralde, personal communication), whereas in mammalian histone mRNAs, UPF1 has a role in the normal degradation of these PABP-less transcripts¹²², possibly explaining the immunity of these mRNAs to further acceleration of their decay rates by the presence of premature terminators¹²³. Most interestingly, NMD of a mini-immunoglobulin-μ mRNA has now been shown to be capable of occurring in an EJC-independent manner, as well as to be dependent on sufficient distance between the premature terminator and the poly(A) tail of the mRNA¹²⁴.

### Concluding remarks

An important corollary of the preceding discussion is that current concepts of the mechanism of translation termination are vastly oversimplified. Prevalent models ascribe most of the crucial functions in termination to two release factors, even though the comparably complicated process of initiation is already known to involve as many as 100 factors. Analyses of NMD discussed here, as well as other studies of the modulation of eRF activity⁷,¹²⁵–¹²⁷, indicate considerable regulation of the termination process and the probable involvement of numerous additional factors. The complexities of termination remain to be unravelled, but our understanding of NMD has already taught us that there can be at least two modes of termination, that the activity of the release factors alone cannot account for all termination functions, and that the proteins that interact with the release factors and the proteins that bind to them can have important roles in post-transcriptional regulation. In addition, the 3′-UTR along with Pab1 might orchestrate the termination of translation in much the same way that the 5′-UTR and the translation initiation protein eIF4G function in initiation.

References 97 and 98 provide experimental evidence for the degradation of yeast and mammalian mRNAs in an initial round of translation. Gonzalez *et al.* demonstrate that the key feature enabling NMD in a newly synthesized yeast transcript is the Hrp1 protein. Ishigaki *et al.* show that transcripts associated with the nuclear cap-binding proteins comprise mammalian NMD substrates and use this observation for the first elaboration of the pioneer round model.

Exon junction complex-independent degradation of nonsense immunoglobulin μ mRNA suggests an evolutionary conserved mechanism for nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. *Nature Struct. Mol. Biol.* **13**, 462–464 (2006). Immunoglobulin-μ nonsense-containing transcripts undergo NMD without a requirement for pre-mRNA splicing or components of the exon junction complex, but this NMD does depend on the proximity of the premature terminator to the poly(A) tail of the mRNA. The data indicate that the faux UTR model for yeast mRNAs might also have relevance for mammalian transcripts.
