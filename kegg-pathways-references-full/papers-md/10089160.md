Two-component regulatory proteins, histidine kinases and response regulators, function in bacteria as sensing and adaptive factors in response to a wide range of environmental stimuli. Conserved histidine and glycine regions of histidine kinase sensor proteins were used to design degenerate oligonucleotide primers for amplification of DNA fragments from *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*. Two adjacent genes, *trcR* and *trcS*, which encode a response regulator and a histidine kinase, respectively, have been identified. Full-length and truncated TrcR and TrcS proteins have been expressed in *Escherichia coli*. Difficulties in expressing recombinant full-length TrcS and a truncated N-terminal form of TrcS reveal that the transmembrane domains are toxic to *E. coli*. Overexpressed truncated C-terminal transmitter domains of TrcS have been autophosphorylated in vitro and have transphosphorylated both the full-length recombinant TrcR protein and the N-terminal receiver/regulator domain of TrcR. In vitro autophosphorylation of TrcS requires the presence of Mn${}^{2+}$ or Ca${}^{2+}$ as a divalent cation cofactor and subsequent transphosphorylation of TrcR is evident in the presence of TrcS-phosphate and Ca${}^{2+}$. Transphosphorylation between these two proteins provides evidence that these *M. tuberculosis* genes encode functional two-component system regulatory proteins that are members of a signal transduction circuit.

Key words: *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*, two-component system, histidine kinase, sensor, response regulator, phosphorylation.

Introduction

*Mycobacterium tuberculosis* is an obligate aerobe that is able to survive and multiply in macrophages. Despite its being a strict pathogen, this bacterium has the ability to survive and proliferate in the presence of host antimicrobials and immune reactions, to remain viable in a dormant state within granulomas of contained infections, to cause disease, and to be transmitted from host to host [1]. Although bacterial mechanisms required by pathogenic mycobacteria to infect macrophages and establish disease or to remain latent within the host are not well understood, it seems likely that regulatory mechanisms allowing the organism to adapt to

changes in its environment are critical in pathogenesis [2]. For this reason, our laboratory has sought to identify two-component regulatory systems present within *M. tuberculosis*.

Two-component regulatory proteins represent a system used by most bacteria to adapt to different environments. They allow bacteria to respond rapidly to changes in their surroundings such as pH, temperature, osmolarity and various nutrient concentrations by the use of two proteins, a histidine kinase sensor and a response regulator, which regulate expression of responsive proteins (for reviews, see references [3–5]). The two proteins make up a communication module whereby the membrane-bound histidine kinase autophosphorylates in the presence of a periplasmic stimulus [3, 6, 7]. The phosphoryl group is then transferred to the response regulator resulting in its activation. Once this exchange occurs, the phosphorylated response regulator is able to regulate the expression of genes or activity of proteins involved in a particular adaptive response. Known two-component regulatory systems control a variety of bacterial processes such as sporulation, transformation competence, membrane transport, inorganic nutrient uptake, chemotaxis and virulence [4].

In a search for unidentified two-component regulatory system genes, we have employed PCR and the use of degenerate oligonucleotide primers to amplify *M. tuberculosis* histidine kinase and response regulator gene fragments. Amplification of sensor fragments from *Staphylococcus aureus* [8], *Coxiella burnetii* [9], *Thermotoga maritima* [10], and the eukaryote, *Dictyostelium discoideum* [11], has been successful. However, the primers developed and used in this study were generated based on different regions of conservation than those used in the aforementioned studies. Two PCR fragments representing a sensor gene and a response regulator gene have been identified. The full-length sensor/histidine kinase gene, *trcS* (tuberculosis regulatory component sensor) and response regulator gene, *trcR* (tuberculosis regulatory component response regulator), have been cloned and sequenced. Although these gene fragments were identified independently via PCR, the genes are adjacent on the *M. tuberculosis* chromosome. The adjacent location of these two genes suggests that *trcR* is the cognate response regulator gene of the sensor/histidine protein kinase gene, *trcS*, and that this pair represents

a two-component regulatory circuit in *M. tuberculosis*. In order to demonstrate function of these genes as cognate two-component regulatory proteins, recombinant proteins have been expressed and *in vitro* autophosphorylation of TrcS and transphosphorylation reactions with TrcR have been performed. Optimal *in vitro* phosphorylation of these proteins requires the presence of Ca²⁺ or Mn²⁺ as the stimulatory divalent cation cofactor.

### Results

#### Identification of a sensor gene fragment

PCR amplification products of approximately 530 bp (data not shown) from genomic DNA of two virulent *M. tuberculosis* strains (H37Rv and TB299) were cloned and sequenced. Of the cloned fragments analyzed, two different sensor gene fragments were identified. One was the previously identified sensor gene, *mtrB* [12], while the other was a previously unidentified sensor gene homolog which has been named *trcS*. Deduced amino acid (aa) sequence analysis of the *trcS* fragment revealed the presence of the highly conserved residues characteristic of sensor proteins. A blast search of GenBank using the deduced sequence of the *trcS* fragment also yielded 140 sensor/histidine kinases out of the 140 best matches.

#### Sequence and analysis of the full-length sensor, *trcS*, and response regulator, *trcR*, genes

When a *trcS* PCR product DNA probe was used to screen a pZErO *M. tuberculosis* plasmid library, two clones, designated pYH4 and pYH6, strongly hybridized (data not shown). Clones pYH4 and pYH6 carry 3.5 kb and 4.0 kb fragments, respectively, of *M. tuberculosis* DNA. A combination of restriction mapping, Southern hybridization, and sequencing revealed that the two clones did not overlap and that *trcS* was localized to a 1.4 kb XhoI fragment of pYH4 and to a 0.6 kb XbaI-PstI fragment of pYH6 (Fig. 1). Primer walking was used to determine the partial DNA sequence of pYH4 and pYH6. Sequence analysis of the insert DNA ends of both clones revealed that the native *trcS* gene was restricted with XbaI during the plasmid

library construction and was cloned on two plasmids. Sequencing of pYH4 identified a partial open reading frame (ORF) of 1,039 bp, starting with an ATG codon, while sequence of pYH6 revealed another partial ORF of 491 bp, ending with a TGA codon. Together, these clones represent the full-length sequence of trcS (Fig. 1) with an ORF of 1,530 bp encoding a protein of 509 aa.

We have also identified novel response regulator gene fragments using a similar PCR and degenerate primer methodology [13]. One of these fragments, now named trcR, had previously been localized to pYH4 (unpublished data) (Fig. 1). The nucleotide sequence upstream of the apparent translation initiation codon of trcS is separated from the stop codon of an upstream ORF by only 7 bp. This ORF sequence of pYH4 upstream of trcS revealed the M. tuberculosis response regulator gene, trcR. By continued primer walking, we were able to determine the full trcR sequence which represents an ORF of 774 bp encoding a protein of 257 aa. Based on the presence of a putative ribosome binding site (RBS) (GAGAGGA) located 9 bp upstream of the second ATG codon within the trcR ORF, this codon likely represents the translational start site for the response regulator (Fig. 1). Also, a putative weak RBS (GGAATGAG) is located 6 bp upstream of the trcS ATG codon within the 3' coding region of trcR (Fig. 1).

The predicted protein sequences of both TrcR and TrcS were compared with the GenBank protein database. TrcR shares significant identity with PhoP (42%) of Bacillus subtilis, CopR (42%) of Pseudomonas syringae, AfsQ1 (39%) of Streptomyces coelicolor, and PhoB (36%) of Klebsiella pneumoniae. Within the N-terminal regulatory domain of response regulators are four highly conserved residues, three aspartates and a lysine, which are essential in the phosphorylation and signaling activities of members of this receiver superfamily [4]. These residues, other less conserved residues, and conserved hydrophobic stretches are all present within the TrcR sequence. The aspartate residue located at position 82 is presumed to be the site of phosphorylation.

Response regulators can also be grouped into classes based on the carboxy terminus sequence [4, 6, 14]. Class 2 response regulators contain helix-turn-helix motifs responsible for DNA binding and include OmpR, PhoB, PhoP and VirG as members of this family [14]. Response regulators classified as class 2 proteins act in conjunction with the *E. coli* vegetative sigma factor, σ70 (or its equivalent in other bacteria) and have five fully conserved residues within this domain. Based on sequence homology, the presence of the five fully conserved residues, and other highly conserved regions TrcR appears to belong to the class 2 protein group.

TrcS shares identity with histidine protein kinases AfsQ2 (29%) of *S. coelicolor*, PhoR (28%) of *E. coli*, *Shigella dysenteriae* and *K. pneumoniae*, ArcB (24%) of *H. influenzae*, CopS (23%) of *P. syringae*, and PhoQ (22%) of *S. typhimurium*. Sequence identity among members of this family of proteins is approximately 25% with the most conserved region lying within about 250 aa of the carboxy terminal kinase domain [5]. The kinase/transmitter region of sensor proteins contains highly conserved residues that have been termed H, N, D/F and G boxes [5]. All of these regions of conservation are represented within the aa sequence of TrcS. The H box represents a region containing the invariant histidine residue located at position 287, the presumed site of phosphorylation. The N box includes two highly conserved asparagine residues spaced three aa apart, the D/F box represents a conserved DXG motif and a conserved phenylalanine residue, and the G box is a glycine-rich region located near the C terminus.

In addition to these regions of conservation, the deduced TrcS protein exhibits conserved regions of hydrophobicity. The topology of histidine kinases predicts two potential hydrophobic membrane-spanning regions. Hydropathy plots using the Kyte and Doolittle analysis reveal the existence of two characteristic N-terminal transmembrane (TM) segments in TrcS (shown schematically in Fig. 2). TM segment 1 is proposed to be between residues 24 and 49, while TM segment 2 lies between residues 188 and 210. Between these TM domains exists the environmental sensing portion of the protein encompassing 138 aa. Residues 211 through 509 do not exhibit any long stretches of hydrophobicity and are assumed to comprise the cytoplasmic linker

and transmitting regions of the protein which also harbor the site of histidine phosphorylation.

Overproduction of full-length and truncated TrcS and TrcR proteins

TrcS is a two-component histidine kinase homolog that contains two regions of hydrophobicity within the N-terminus that presumably anchor the protein to the cytoplasmic membrane. The C-terminal portion of TrcS contains no extended hydrophobic regions and is predicted to be intracellular. Attempts to overexpress recombinant TrcS have been unsuccessful since the protein is apparently toxic to *E. coli*. After induction of TrcS, the cells began to die, thus reducing the amount of recombinant TrcS produced. Since our immediate goal was to demonstrate its biochemical function as a two-component phosphorylated protein, truncated forms of TrcS were overexpressed and purified. It has previously been shown that truncated sensor proteins expressing only the cytoplasmic domain are capable of autophosphorylation and subsequent transfer of the phosphoryl group to its cognate response regulator [10, 15–22]. Shown schematically in Fig. 2, two truncated forms of

Mycobacterium tuberculosis TrcR-TrcS two-component system

TrcS, representative of the C-terminus, cytoplasmic portion, have been overexpressed successfully in *E. coli*. Jin *et al.* have shown that truncated histidine kinases excluding the linker region are autophosphorylated more efficiently than those expressing both the linker and the transmitter regions [18]. Trc$^{C-term1}$ recombinant protein deletes the N-terminal 218 residues and initiates within the cytoplasmic linker region at Thr-219 located 8 residues downstream of the second TM domain and 68 residues upstream of the presumed site of phosphorylation, His-287. Recombinant Trc$^{C-term2}$ deletes the N-terminal 274 aa, expresses only the histidine transmitter domain, and begins at Asp-275 located 12 residues upstream of the invariant histidine.

In addition, we have attempted to overexpress the TrcS N-terminus, Trc$^{N-term}$, (Fig. 2) corresponding to the short, cytoplasmic N-terminal region, the first TM-spanning region, the periplasmic sensing domain, and the second TM-spanning region in order to determine if the TM sequences cause TrcS lethality in *E. coli*. Similar to full-length TrcS expression, attempts to induce expression of the Trc$^{N-term}$ clone, pCG1, resulted in cell lysis (Fig. 3) and no overproduction of the recombinant protein.

Expression cultures of pCG3, pCG5, and pSH4 corresponding to Trc$^{C-term1}$, Trc$^{C-term2}$ and TrcR, respectively, were grown in *E. coli*, and the recombinant proteins were purified under native conditions. Figure 4 shows the apparent expression of Trc$^{C-term1}$ at 35 kDa [panel (a), lane 3] and Trc$^{C-term2}$ at 31 kDa [panel (a), lane 6]. Elution of the TrcR supernatant yielded two polypeptides from the purification column [Fig. 4, panel (b), lane 3] which exhibit apparent molecular masses of approximately 35 kDa and 32 kDa. It should be noted that attached histidine tags can cause slower migration rates and thus make recombinant proteins appear slightly larger than expected. Theoretical molecular weights of the Trc$^{C-term1}$, Trc$^{C-term2}$, and TrcR recombinant proteins are 33 kDa, 27 kDa, and 32 kDa, respectively. Because both TrcR proteins were retained on the column by the six consecutive histidine residues (6 × His) tag at the N-terminus, the smaller TrcR polypeptide is presumably a degradation product of the full-length TrcR. Induced expression of another TrcR clone exhibited similar results (data not shown). Attempts to prevent or limit degradation were unsuccessful, but the presence of smaller forms did not inhibit, but rather, were also involved in the in vitro activity of TrcR (see below).

Autophosphorylation of Trc$^{C-term1}$ and Trc$^{C-term2}$

To investigate the in vitro autophosphorylation capacity of the truncated Trc$^{C-term1}$ and Trc$^{C-term2}$ proteins, both were incubated in the presence of [$\gamma^{-33}$P]ATP. Histidine protein kinases require certain divalent cations for their activities. To determine the effect of different divalent cations on TrcS autokinase activity, MgCl$_2$, MnCl$_2$, or CaCl$_2$ at a concentration of 5 mM were added to the autophosphorylation reaction buffer. Figure 5 shows the phosphorylation abilities of the Trc$^{C-term1}$ and Trc$^{C-term2}$ proteins with various divalent cations present. At cation concentrations of 5 mM, Trc$^{C-term1}$ was stimulated similarly, but slightly more, in the presence of Ca$^{2+}$ (lane 5) compared to Mn$^{2+}$ (lane 3) and was undetected with Mg$^{2+}$ (lane 1). Trc$^{C-term2}$ autophosphorylation was stimulated most in the presence of Mn$^{2+}$ (lane 3), slightly less with Ca$^{2+}$ (lane 5) (as compared to Mn$^{2+}$), and only

minimally with Mg<sup>2+</sup> (lane 1). Levels of autophosphorylation were not increased when TrcS<sup>C-term1</sup> or TrcS<sup>C-term2</sup> were incubated with [γ-<sup>33</sup>P]ATP in the presence of both Mn<sup>2+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> at 5 mM each (data not shown). All phosphorylation reactions hereafter were performed in the presence of CaCl<sub>2</sub>, since its stimulation of both TrcS<sup>C-term1</sup> and TrcS<sup>C-term2</sup> resulted in similar amounts of phosphorylation (lane 5). Both TrcS<sup>C-term1</sup> and TrcS<sup>C-term2</sup> were incubated in the presence of [α-<sup>33</sup>P]ATP and 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, MnCl<sub>2</sub>, or CaCl<sub>2</sub> (lanes 2, 4 and 6, respectively) to show that the γ-phosphate of ATP is used as a substrate for autophosphorylation. Autophosphorylation of TrcS<sup>C-term1</sup> or TrcS<sup>C-term2</sup> was not evident under any conditions with [α-<sup>33</sup>P]ATP demonstrating that phosphorylation is not merely due to ATP binding.

Autophosphorylation mixtures were performed in the presence of the following divalent cations at a concentration of 5 mM: MgCl<sub>2</sub> (lanes 1–2), MnCl<sub>2</sub> (lanes 3–4), and CaCl<sub>2</sub> (lanes 5–6). Reactions were separated by SDS-PAGE, and dried gels were exposed to X-ray film for 24 h at –80°C.

Transphosphorylation of TrcR by TrcS<sup>C-term1</sup>-phosphate and TrcS<sup>C-term2</sup>-phosphate

To assay the biochemical transfer of the phosphoryl group from TrcS, the TrcR proteins were subsequently added to the phosphorylation reaction mix. The TrcS<sup>C-term1</sup> and the TrcS<sup>C-term2</sup> proteins were individually incubated with [γ-<sup>33</sup>P]ATP (Fig. 6, lanes 1–4) in the presence of CaCl<sub>2</sub> for 10 min, and then TrcR was added to the reaction mixture (Fig. 6, lanes 2 and 4). The transphosphorylation reaction with TrcR and either TrcS<sup>C-term1</sup>-phosphate or TrcS<sup>C-term2</sup>-phosphate was incubated at room temperature for 10 min. Figure 6 panel (b) shows the results of autophosphorylation of TrcS<sup>C-term1</sup> (lanes 1) or TrcS<sup>C-term2</sup> (lane 3) and subsequent transfer of the phosphate group to TrcR (lanes 2 and 4) by TrcS<sup>C-term1</sup>-phosphate and TrcS<sup>C-term2</sup>-phosphate, respectively. Similar levels of TrcR transphosphorylation were obtained with both TrcS<sup>C-term1</sup>-phosphate and TrcS<sup>C-term2</sup>-phosphate in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Both TrcR protein products are transphosphorylated, giving strength to the idea that both products contain the N-terminal regulatory portion of the protein. Incubation of TrcR with [γ-<sup>33</sup>P]ATP, without the presence of phosphorylated TrcS<sup>C-term1</sup> or TrcS<sup>C-term2</sup>, did not result in detectable phosphorylation of TrcR (Fig. 6, lane 5). This indicates that TrcR is not phosphorylated by ATP alone and that transphosphorylation of TrcR requires the presence

Autophosphorylation and transphosphorylation were performed as described in Materials and Methods. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (a) and radioactivity was detected by autoradiography (b). Phosphorylation reactions were performed in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and [γ-<sup>33</sup>P]ATP (lanes 1–5) or [α-<sup>33</sup>P]ATP (lane 6). Lane 1 shows autophosphorylation of TrcS<sup>C-term1</sup>, and lane 2 shows subsequent transphosphorylation of TrcR<sup>N-term</sup>.

of TrcS-phosphate. In addition, incubation of TrcS<sup>C-term2</sup> and subsequently TrcR with [α-<sup>33</sup>P]ATP resulted in neither autophosphorylation nor transphosphorylation (Fig. 6, lane 6). Hence, TrcS in its phosphorylated state serves as the substrate required for transphosphorylation of TrcR, and the presence of ATP alone is not sufficient for transphosphorylation.

protein. Since autophosphorylation activity of TrcS is retained upon removal of the sensing, TM domain of the protein, we expected that removal of the TrcR DNA-binding, C-terminal domain would not affect its ability to be transphosphorylated. In addition, Delgado et al. [23] have shown transphosphorylation of the OmpR N-terminal domain by the EnvZ C-terminal domain. Also, since TrcS<sup>C-term1</sup>, TrcS<sup>C-term2</sup> and TrcR all migrate between 27 kDa and 35 kDa on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, production of a truncated form of TrcR, TrcR<sup>N-term</sup>, would also allow distinct autoradiography separation of the phosphorylation activities of TrcS and TrcR. The TrcR<sup>N-term</sup> recombinant protein, expressed from pSH57, retains the N-terminal 153 residues, contains the presumed site of phosphorylation, Asp-82, and deletes the C-terminal 104 residues of the DNA-binding domain (Fig. 2). Overexpression and purification of the approximately 22 kDa TrcR<sup>N-term</sup> protein [Fig. 4, panel (b), lanes 4–6] were performed as described above.

To determine if TrcR<sup>N-term</sup> can be phosphorylated by TrcS<sup>C-term1</sup>-phosphate or TrcS<sup>C-term2</sup>-phosphate, the transphosphorylation reactions as described above with full-length TrcR were repeated with TrcR<sup>N-term</sup>. Figure 7 shows that, similar to full-length TrcR, TrcR<sup>N-term</sup> is able to accept the phosphoryl group from TrcS<sup>C-term1</sup>-phosphate (lane 2) or TrcS<sup>C-term2</sup>-phosphate (lane 4), yet not from ATP alone (lane 6). Also, neither autophosphorylation of TrcS<sup>C-term2</sup> or transphosphorylation of TrcR<sup>N-term</sup> was evident in the presence of [α-<sup>33</sup>P]ATP (lane 5). Efficient transphosphorylation of TrcR<sup>N-term</sup> indicates that the N-terminal catalytic domain of this response regulator is able to fold properly and become activated by γ-phosphate independent of its C-terminal output domain. These results reiterate that TrcS and TrcR are two-component system proteins capable of transducing phosphorylation signals.

### Production and transphosphorylation of the N-terminal domain of TrcR

Similar to other two-component response regulators, the TrcR protein consists of two distinct domains. The N-terminal portion is the receiver domain which contains the invariant aspartate that is presumed to be transphosphorylated by TrcS. The C-terminal domain is predicted to be the DNA-binding or effector portion of the

### Discussion

The *trcS*, histidine kinase, and *trcR*, response regulator, genes have been identified independently of one another through the use of degenerate oligonucleotide PCR. Localization of the full-length sequence on the *M. tuberculosis* chromosome has revealed that the genes are adjacent to one another and appear to be transcribed in the same direction. Two-component

TrcS sensor disrupting the cell membrane. To demonstrate that cell membrane disruption was the reason for cellular death, we attempted to overexpress only the N-terminal, TM domain of the sensor. As shown in Fig. 3, upon induction of the full-length TrcS and the N-terminal Trc-S<sup>N-term</sup> proteins, the cells began to lyse. The similar growth curves indicate that it is likely the TM domain that is toxic to *E. coli*. Since the TrcS<sup>N-term</sup> protein does not contain the transmitter domain, it would not be possible for the sensor to communicate with any native *E. coli* response regulators via crosstalk.

Since it was not possible to overexpress the full-length TrcS sensor, shorter, truncated versions of the protein representing the cytoplasmic C-terminus were generated. The TrcS<sup>C-term1</sup> truncated protein comprises the linker region proximal to the second TM-spanning region and the transmitter kinase domain. TrcS<sup>C-term2</sup> represents only the transmitter kinase region. Both proteins contain the histidine residue, found within the kinase domain, that is required for autophosphorylation. Both TrcS<sup>C-term1</sup> and TrcS<sup>C-term2</sup> are able to autophosphorylate in the presence of [γ-<sup>33</sup>P]ATP and specific divalent cations. The TrcS cognate response regulator was also overexpressed in two forms: full-length TrcR and TrcR<sup>N-term</sup>, a truncated portion containing only the N-terminal receiver domain. Both TrcR and TrcR<sup>N-term</sup> are able to be transphosphorylated by TrcS<sup>C-term1</sup>-phosphate and TrcS<sup>C-term2</sup>-phosphate. In contrast, neither of the TrcR proteins were phosphorylated when incubated with [γ-<sup>33</sup>P]ATP alone or [α-<sup>33</sup>P]ATP.

Histidine kinases and response regulators require the presence of a divalent cation, usually Mg<sup>2+</sup>, for autophosphorylation and subsequent transphosphorylation. The divalent cation is utilized within the active site of the proteins and catalyzes the phosphorylation of the histidine or aspartate residue [5]. Of the histidine kinases that have been subjected to in vitro autophosphorylation, the vast majority require Mg<sup>2+</sup>, while only EnvZ [16] from *E. coli* is stimulated with Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and FrzE [24] and AsgA [25] of *M. xanthus* and FixL [26] of *R. meliloti* are optimally stimulated in the presence of Mn<sup>2+</sup>. In vitro autophosphorylation of KinA from *Bacillus subtilis* occurs in the presence of both Mg<sup>2+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> [27]. Optimum autophosphorylation of TrcS<sup>C-term1</sup> and TrcS<sup>C-term2</sup> occurs in the presence of either Mn<sup>2+</sup> or Ca<sup>2+</sup>, whereas, Mg<sup>2+</sup> only minimally stimulates activity. Additionally, both TrcS<sup>C-term1</sup> and TrcS<sup>C-term2</sup> can efficiently and similarly

system genes that are juxtaposed on the chromosome are usually cognate in that the encoded proteins communicate with one another via phosphorylation. Based on predicted aa sequence homology, these genes were presumed to encode two-component system proteins. However, in order to accurately classify them as a signal transduction system, their biochemical function as phosphorylation-communicating proteins needed to be ascertained.

Overexpression of the full-length TrcS protein in *E. coli* resulted in cell lysis. Initially, we speculated that the TrcS sensor could be active within *E. coli* and was possibly crosstalking with a native *E. coli* response regulator to alter the cell's regulatory processes in a way that was detrimental to its survival. However, it was most likely that lysis of *E. coli* resulted from the

autophosphorylate and subsequently trans-
phosphorylate TrcR and TrcR<sup>N-term</sup> in the pres-
ence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Although the concentration of
either Mn<sup>2+</sup> or Ca<sup>2+</sup> required for *in vitro* auto-
phosphorylation are presumably much higher
than physiological intracellular levels, these cat-
ions are likely substituting for the *in vivo* re-
quirement for activation. Since the TrcS histidine
kinase is the first mycobacterial sensor to be
subjected to biochemical studies, it is not yet
evident which divalent cation *M. tuberculosis*
prefers as a phosphorylation cofactor.

In addition to the TrcR/TrcS system, two other
*M. tuberculosis* two-component systems, MtrA/
MtrB [12] and SenX3/RegX3 [28], have been
reported. To date, neither the environmental
signals that activate the systems nor their regu-
lated genes have been determined for any of the
three systems. Sequence analysis reveals that
there are no ORFs located within 175 bp 5′ from
the start of the *trcR* gene. On the opposite DNA
strand, there is a predicted *kdpC* gene encoding a
putative potassium-transporting ATPase c chain
[29]. The *kdpC* gene appears to be transcribed
in the opposite direction of *trcR* and *trcS* and
terminates one bp from the stop codon of the
*trcS* gene. The *kdpC* gene is the fifth gene of
the potassium transporter system gene cluster
which includes its own two-component regu-
latory proteins [29] and thus is most likely not
regulated by its neighboring *trcR* and *trcS* gene
products. Therefore, the *trcR/trcS* gene products
do not appear to regulate any genes directly
adjacent to them on the chromosome.

These studies demonstrate that TrcS acts as
an autokinase that is able to transphosphorylate
TrcR. Phosphorylation communication between
the TrcS sensor and the TrcR response regulator
suggests that the two proteins are cognate regu-
latory components and would act together to
regulate an unknown process in *M. tuberculosis*. Although it has been reported that MtrA, an-
other *M. tuberculosis* response regulator, can be
transphosphorylated by the heterologous CheA
histidine kinase [12], the TrcR/TrcS system is
the first to be biochemically studied at both
the histidine kinase autophosphorylation and
subsequent response regulator transphos-
phorylation steps. Hence, this two-component
system appears to function as a cognate signal
transduction circuit. Since TrcR appears to be
a member of the class 2 family of response
regulators, it likely functions *in vivo* as a DNA-
binding transcriptional regulator. However, the
role that TrcR and TrcS plays in the *in vivo*

growth and/or virulence of *M. tuberculosis* re-
mains unknown, and the genes regulated by this
two-component system have yet to be identified.
Further studies are being performed to deter-
mine the environmental signals that activate
the system and to identify the TrcR/TrcS two-
component regulated genes in *M. tuberculosis*.

# Materials and methods

## Bacterial strains and media

Escherichia coli DH5α and JM109 were used for
routine amplifications of plasmid DNA. For re-
combinant expression of all proteins (TrcS,
TrcS<sup>N-term</sup>, TrcS<sup>C-term1</sup>, TrcS<sup>C-term2</sup>, TrcR and
TrcR<sup>N-term</sup>), E. coli M15 with the pREP4 repressor
plasmid (QIAexpress system; Qiagen Inc., Va-
lencia, CA, U.S.A.) was used. Cells were grown
in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth with the addition
of ampicillin (Ap) (100 μg/ml) or kanamycin
(Kn) (25 μg/ml) as appropriate. Mycobacterium
tuberculosis strain TB299 is a virulent, clinical
isolate from Alabama. Mycobacterium tuberculosis
H37Rv (ATCC 27294) and TB299 were grown
and DNA was isolated as previously described
[30].

## Degenerate oligonucleotide primer PCR
amplification

Degenerate oligonucleotide primers for histidine
kinase gene amplification were designed based
on the conserved H box and the glycine-rich G
box regions that are generally separated by a
range of 400 to 600 bp [4, 5]. Primers were de-
rived from the conserved regions (signature aa
residues in bold) of PhoQ of S. typhimurium and
E. coli (LTDLTHS and GQGVGLA), PhoR of E.
coli (FANVSHE and GSGLGLA), MtrB of M.
tuberculosis (TSDVSHE and GTGLGLA) and
PhoR of M. leprae (VANVSHE and GSGLGLA).
The H box region (forward) primer SH9 (5′-
ACGTTCTAGARYVSSSRAYGTSAGSCACGA-
3′) and the G box region (reverse) primers SH6
and SH10 (5′-ACGTAAGCTTCGSRASCCSRA-
NCCNTGNCCNN-3′ and 5′-ACGTAAGCTTS-
GCSARVCCCARVCCCSGTVCC-3′) were syn-
thesized by Oligos, Etc., Inc. (Wilsonville, OR,
U.S.A.). To assist in cloning, *PstI*, *XbaI*, or *HindIII*
restriction enzyme recognition sites (underlined)
were added to the 5′-ends of the primers. Primers

previously described by Wren et al. [13] were used for response regulator gene amplification. PCR reactions were performed using a low annealing temperature of 40°C to allow hybridization between sequences with some mismatches.

### Plasmid construction and DNA sequence analysis

PCR products of approximately 530bp for sensors and 320bp for response regulators were purified and cloned into the *E. coli* vector pMOB [31] or pUC19. *Escherichia coli* DH5α cells were transformed by electroporation, and transformants were selected on LB/Ap plates. A chromosomal clone bank of *M. tuberculosis* TB299 DNA was created by isolating genomic DNA using a mini-bead beater, blunting the ends with T4 polymerase, linking the DNA with *XbaI* oligos, and digesting with *XbaI*. DNA fragments were cloned into an *XbaI*-restriction modified pZErO vector (Invitrogen Corp., San Diego, CA, U.S.A.) that had been altered by replacing the zeomycin resistance marker with a Kn resistance marker and were transformed into *E. coli*. DNA sequencing was performed by automated fluorescent sequencing (UAB Dept. of Microbiology, Core Sequencing Facility, Birmingham, AL, U.S.A.). The sequence accession number for *trcR* and *trcS* is U88959.

### Construction and purification of full-length and truncated TrcS and TrcR proteins

Full-length or truncated *trcS* and *trcR* genes were amplified from *M. tuberculosis* TB299 chromosomal DNA by using PCR primers that contained restriction enzyme site linkers (underlined) at the 5′ ends. PCR primer pairs SH26 (forward) (5′CGGGATCCATCCCGGACCGAAACACTCGG-3′) and SH28 (reverse) (5′-CGGGGTACCAGCGTCTGATCGAGGACAC-3′), SH26 and SH33 (reverse) (5′-CGGGTACCATCTGGTGTCGTACGG-3′), SH34 (forward) (5′-CGGGATCCACCGGCCGTGACGTGCCAC-3′) and SH28, and SH37 (5′-CGCGGATCCATTGGCGGATGCGGCAGTT-3′) and SH28 were used to amplify *trcS*, *trcS*<sup>N-term</sup>, *trcS*<sup>C-term1</sup>, and *trcS*<sup>C-term2</sup> gene products, respectively. PCR primer pairs SH29 (forward) (5′-CGGGATCCACGATGTCTGGGGTACA-CG-3′) and SH30 (reverse) (5′-CGGGGTA-CCTTTTCTGGACCGAGTGT TTC-3′) and SH29 and SH40 (reverse) (5′-AAAAC TG CAGC-AGATGGC TGGAGCGGGC-3′) were used to amplify *trcR* and *trcR*<sup>N-term</sup> gene products, respectively. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by Oligos, Etc., Inc. (Wilsonville, OR, U.S.A.). After digestion with the appropriate restriction enzymes, the PCR products were ligated into the pQE40 expression vector (modified by removal of DHFR) (Qiagen, Inc., Valencia, CA, U.S.A.). Ligation reactions were electro-transformed into the *E. coli* expression strain M15 [pREP4]. pQE40<sup>ADHFR</sup> expression constructs pSH22, pCG1, pCG3, pCG5, pSH33 and pSH57 encoding TrcS, TrcS<sup>N-term</sup>, TrcS<sup>C-term1</sup>, TrcS<sup>C-term2</sup>, TrcR and TrcR<sup>N-term</sup>, respectively, contain six consecutive histidine residues at the N-terminus which serve as an affinity tag in purification procedures. The cloning junction and entire insert of each plasmid was sequenced to verify in-frame translation of the 6 × His tag and the respective coding fragment and fidelity of PCR amplification. Cultures were induced with 1 mM isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) and were incubated for an additional 4 h at 37°C. During incubation, the optical density at 600 nanometers (nm) was recorded at 20 min intervals. Induced and uninduced cells were then harvested by centrifugation.

The recombinant 6 × His fusion proteins were purified over nickel-nitrotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) agarose columns as described by the manufacturer (Qiagen, Inc., Valencia, CA, U.S.A.). Briefly, whole cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer, sonicated, and centrifuged. Sonicate supernatants were collected and loaded onto Ni-NTA agarose columns. Tagged fusion proteins were eluted with 250 mM imidazole and collected in 0.5 ml aliquots. Cellular supernatants and protein eluates were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) on 12% polyacrylamide gels that were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue.

### In vitro phosphorylation and transphosphorylation analysis

Protein phosphorylation reactions were carried out for 10 min at room temperature in autophosphorylation buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl,

pH 8.0, 50 mM KCl) supplemented with MgCl₂, MnCl₂, or CaCl₂ at a concentration of 5 mM. Reactions were initiated by the addition of [γ-³³P]ATP (10 mCi/ml, 2,000 to 4,000 Ci/mmol; NEN, Boston, MA, U.S.A.), terminated by the addition of 5 × SDS sample buffer, heated at 90°C, and subjected to SDS-PAGE on 12% polyacrylamide gels. For transphosphorylation reactions, TrcR or TrcR<sup>N-term</sup> was added to the autophosphorylation reaction mix and incubation was continued for an additional 10 min. After electrophoresis, the gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, dried, and exposed to BioMAX MR film for 24 h.
