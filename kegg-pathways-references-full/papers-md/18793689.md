## ABSTRACT

Kisspeptins, the products of KiSS-1 gene acting via G protein-coupled receptor 54 (GPR54), have recently emerged as fundamental gatekeepers of gonadal function by virtue of their ability to stimulate gonadotropin secretion. Indeed, since the original disclosure of the reproductive facet of the KiSS-1/GPR54 system, an ever-growing number of studies have substantiated the extraordinary potency of kisspeptins to elicit gonadotropin secretion in different mammalian species, under different physiologic and experimental conditions, and through different routes of administration. In this context, studies conducted in laboratory rodents have been enormously instrumental to characterize: (i) the primary mechanisms of action of kisspeptins in the control of gonadotropin secretion; (ii) the pharmacological consequences of acute vs. continuous activation of GPR54; (iii) the roles of specific populations of kisspeptin-producing neurons at the hypothalamus in mediating the feedback effects of sex steroids; (v) the function of kisspeptins in the generation of the pre-ovulatory surge of gonadotropins; and (iv) the influence of sex steroids on GnRH/gonadotropin responsiveness to kisspeptins. While some of those aspects of kisspeptin function will be covered elsewhere in this Special Issue, we summarize herein the most salient data, obtained in laboratory rodents, that have helped to define the physiologic roles and putative pharmacological implications of kisspeptins in the control of male and female gonadotropic axis.

described in the rat and later in the sheep [1,31]. More recently, kisspeptin-54 has been proven to elicit LH and, to a lesser extent, FSH secretion in humans, thus proving the conserved role of kisspeptins as potent stimulators of gonadotropin release in mammals [8,9]. Overall, the striking similarities of the effects of kisspeptins on gonadotropin secretion among different mammalian species reinforced the usefulness of rodent studies for covering the physiologic and pharmacological goals defined above.

In this scenario, genetic and pharmacological studies in rodents, conducted over the last 4 years, have paved the way for the characterization of the effects and mechanisms of action of kisspeptins in the control of gonadotropin secretion. In fact, the demonstration of the state of hypogonadotropism in mice engineered to lack a functional GPR54 gene initially evidenced the involvement of the system in the control of gonadotropin secretion [12,46]; a phenomenon that has been more recently confirmed in KiSS-1 null mice [7]. Moreover, the fact that the potent stimulatory effects of kisspeptin-10 were completely blocked in GPR54 knockout mice, despite preserved pituitary responsiveness to GnRH, demonstrated that the gonadotropic effects of kisspeptin are solely mediated via GPR54 [28].

Pharmacological tests conducted in rats and mice were the first to document the extraordinarily potent LH releasing effects of kisspeptin-10 and kisspeptin-54 (metastin). Thus, threshold doses for LH stimulation were defined (depending on the study considered) between 100 fmol and 1 pmol, for protocols of intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) or intrahypothalamic administration [13,32,34]. Moreover, such stimulatory effects were also detected after systemic injection, over a variety of routes (intravenous, subcutaneous and intraperitoneal) and a range of doses [32,59]. Based on detailed dose-response studies conducted in vivo, the median effective dose (ED50) for LH was calculated at 2–4 pmol, for i.c.v. administration [4,32]. Concerning systemic delivery, doses as low as 0.1 μg/rat (~0.3 nmol/kg BW) i.v. were sufficient to induce robust LH peaks in freely moving rats [59]. Overall, comparative analysis of the published data on the LH releasing activity of kisspeptins and other neuropeptides and neurotransmitters, such as glutamate and galanin-like peptide (GALP), demonstrate that kisspeptins are likely the most potent elicitors of the GnRH/LH axis known so far [53]. For instance, the direct comparison of the LH releasing effects of GALP and kisspeptin-10 in male rats demonstrated that, despite similarly maximal responses are achieved after stimulation with high doses of both peptides, i.e., in the nmol range, the ED50 for kisspeptin-10 was approximately 150-fold lower than for GALP [4].

As was the case for LH, rodent studies have also documented the ability of kisspeptins to stimulate FSH secretion [31]. The data available, however, evidences that the threshold doses for FSH stimulation are clearly higher than for LH, with a predicted ED50 of 400 pmol, for i.c.v. administration (i.e., ~200-fold less sensitive) [31]. The mechanisms behind such divergence are likely diverse and will be discussed in following sections. In addition, the time-course for the stimulatory effects of kisspeptin on FSH release in male rats appears to be somewhat slower than for LH secretion [31].

Notwithstanding, the stimulatory effects of high doses (1 nmol/i.c.v.) of kisspeptin-10 on LH and FSH secretion were fully preserved after antagonization of ionotropic glutamate (NMDA and KA/AMPA) receptors, as well as after blockade of the endogenous nitric oxide (NO) tone [31,32]; well-known physiologic modulators of gonadotropin secretion. The functional implications of these observations are discussed below. Interestingly enough, rodent studies have also documented that the robust LH and FSH releasing effects of kisspeptins are equally detected in both male and female animals, at different stages of postnatal maturation [2]. For instance, in rats, the ability of kisspeptin to potently elicit LH secretion has been demonstrated in males and females at the neonatal, infantile, juvenile and pubertal stages of sexual maturation [2], as well as in adulthood [32,42]. On the latter, kisspeptin-10 was able to evoke significant LH responses not only in adult males, but also in cyclic female rats at different stages of the estrous cycle, as well as during pregnancy and, even, lactation [42]. Of note, however, the sensitivity to kisspeptin in terms of LH secretion appears to be significantly depressed in lactating dams; a phenomenon that might contribute to the state of hypogonadotropism linked to this condition [42]. In addition, the stimulatory effects of kisspeptins on FSH secretion have been documented in peripubertal and adult male and female rats [31,42]. Overall, such a consistency for the stimulatory effects of kisspeptins on gonadotropin secretion across sexual development and sexes further documents not only the physiologic role but also the potential pharmacological interest of the KiSS-1/GPR54 system in the control of the gonadotropic axis in mammals.

### Mechanisms of action of kisspeptins in the control of gonadotropin secretion

The initial disclosure of the extraordinarily potent releasing effects of kisspeptins on gonadotropin secretion boosted an enormous interest for the identification of the potential mechanisms involved. Several lines of evidence, accumulated over the last years, have substantiated that the primary site of action of kisspeptins in the control of the gonadotropic axis is located at hypothalamic GnRH neurons. Such experimental evidence can be summarized into the following points: (i) the potent LH and FSH releasing effects of kisspeptin-10 are completely abrogated after pre-treatment with GnRH antagonists in male and female rodents [13,27,31,32]; (ii) GnRH neurons in the rat forebrain do express GPR54 gene [21]; (iii) kisspeptin activates GnRH neurons in rodents, as evidenced by induction of c-fos expression [21], as well as potent and long-lasting depolarization responses [15]; (iv) kisspeptin induces, in a dose-dependent manner, the secretion of GnRH by hypothalamic explants ex vivo [3,56]; and (v) murine cell lines parentally related to GnRH neurons, such as GT1-7 cells, express GPR54 mRNA and are able, under some conditions, to respond to kisspeptin stimulation [22,37]. In the same line, we have observed that GnRH-deficient *hpg* mice are unable to respond to kisspeptin stimulation in terms of LH secretion (see Fig. 1). Altogether, the above data demonstrate that hypothalamic GnRH is an obligate mediator for the gonadotropin-releasing effects of kisspeptins.
pharmacological blockade of key intracellular signals/factors following in vitro stimulation with kisspeptin [2]. Using this approach, it has been suggested that the stimulatory effects of kisspeptin on GnRH secretion require the activation of phospholipase-C (PLC), mobilization of intracellular Ca²⁺ stores and recruitment of ERK1/2 and p38 kinases [2]. In contrast, kisspeptin-induced GnRH release was preserved in spite of the blockade of adenylate cyclase (i.e., it was not dependent on cAMP signaling) and did not apparently require the influx of extracellular Ca²⁺, at least in this ex vivo setting (see Fig. 2). These features are remarkably similar to those reported for GPR54 signaling using heterologous cell systems, as described in detail elsewhere in this Special Issue. In the last few months, two different papers have refined the above observations by using electrophysiological recordings and calcium imaging in GnRH neurons. These reports have documented that kisspeptin excitation of GnRH neurons is conveyed through a PLC/calcium-dependent pathway regulating multiple ion channels, including potassium and transient receptor potential (TRP) channels [25,61].

As indicated in Section 2, the profiles of LH and FSH secretion after kisspeptin stimulation appear partially different, with faster and more sensitive LH responses in male rats. One possible explanation for such a phenomenon is that stimulation of GnRH neurons with kisspeptin, at the low dose range, elicits a pattern of GnRH release that favors preferential secretion of LH. In this sense, profiles of high frequency pulses are prone to elicit LH secretion were as low frequencies favor FSH synthesis [26]. Of note, however, acute injection of kisspeptin is apparently unable to significantly alter the frequency of pulsatile release of GnRH, as indirectly evidenced by recording of hypothalamic multiunit electrical activity volleys, at least in gonadectomized female rats [24]. On the other hand, the fact that blockade of major regulatory pathways of GnRH secretion, such as glutamate and NO, did not prevent the releasing effects of kisspeptin strongly suggest that the KiSS-1/GPR54 system is independent, or eventually distal, to those central regulators in the control of GnRH neurons [31,32]. Admittedly, however, the evidence published to date on the above interactions is restricted to the testing of high doses of kisspeptin-10, which hampers the assessment of potential, subtle changes in its effects at the low dose range. Moreover, it has been recently described in mice that blockade of glutamate receptors reduced the stimulatory effects of kisspeptin on GnRH neuronal activity, which suggests that at least part of the releasing effects of kisspeptin might be mediated by activation of glutamate pathways [35]; a possibility that warrants further investigation. In addition, due to the lack of effective antagonists of GPR54, evaluation of the consequences of blockade of kisspeptin signaling on GnRH/gonadotropin responses to a diversity of central excitatory signals (including glutamate) has not been yet conducted.

Finally, while it is well defined that the primary site of action of the KiSS-1/GPR54 system in the control of the reproductive axis is located at the hypothalamus, some controversy persists on the possibility of additional effects of kisspeptins directly at the pituitary level. In this sense, original reports documented either no effects or modest stimulatory actions of kisspeptin on LH secretion by rat

Fig. 1 – Lack of LH responses in hpg mice i.p. injected with an effective dose of mouse kisspeptin-10 (10 μg). The hpg mouse harbors an inactivating mutation in the GnRH gene that alters its processing and renders the animal hypogonadotropic. As shown in the figure, while wild-type mice respond to systemic administration of kisspeptin-10 with a robust LH secretory peak at 15-min after injection, hpg mice failed to respond to a similar stimulus. This observation further confirms that GnRH is an indispensable mediator for the stimulatory effects of kisspeptin on gonadotropin secretion. Groups with different superscript letters are statistically (P < 0.05) different.

The physiologic relevance of such a kisspeptin-GnRH pathway for the generation of gonadotropin responses to kisspeptins is further documented by the demonstration of a close association between GnRH responses detected ex vivo and LH responses observed in vivo, at different developmental stages, in male and female rats [2]. Moreover, it has been recently demonstrated that populations of KiSS-1 neurons (such as those at the AVPV-nucleus) physically interact with GnRH neurons in the mouse forebrain [5]. In sum, the above data point out that kisspeptin input (steaming from specific KiSS-1 neurons located at discrete hypothalamic areas) drives the activation of GnRH neurons, which do express the canonical KiSS-1 receptor. Interestingly, the stimulation of GnRH neurons by kisspeptin at critical developmental stages, such as puberty, appears to be under the precise regulation of a combination of factors, including not only the enhancement of kisspeptin tone, but also plastic changes involving an elevation of the number of projections to GnRH neurons, as well as an increase in the sensitivity to kisspeptin and GPR54 signaling efficiency [39]. Of note, based on data from expression analyses in vivo, the effects of kisspeptin on GnRH neurons do not apparently involve, at least in the short-term, the transcriptional activation of GnRH gene but rather stimulation of secretion of the releasable pool of GnRH [32]. This feature, together with their capacity to act directly at nerve terminal to evoke GnRH release [6], explain the ability of kisspeptins to elicit the acute increases in circulating levels of LH described in previous sections.

Until recently, the signaling pathways responsible for the stimulatory effects of kisspeptins on GnRH neurons had only been evaluated using hypothalamic explants and protocols of

Fig. 2 – Tentative model for the signaling pathways recruited following GPR54 activation by kisspeptin at the hypothalamus. Using protocols of pharmacological blockade and kisspeptin stimulation of hypothalamic explants ex vivo, it was demonstrated that the GnRH releasing effect of kisspeptin is blunted by: (i) inactivation of PLC (by means of U-73122); (ii) depletion of intracellular Ca²⁺ stores (by thapsigargin); and (iii) blockade of ERK1/2 and p38 kinase (by PD-98059 and SB-203580, respectively). In contrast, GnRH responses were preserved after antagonization of adenylate cyclase (by MDL-12,330A; not shown), inhibition of extracellular Ca²⁺ influx (by cadmium), or blockade of Jun N-terminal kinase (by SP-600125). Likewise, GnRH responses to kisspeptin were also detected after inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis by indomethacin (not shown). Composed from data of Ref. [2].

pituitaries in vitro [39]. More recently, the ability of kisspeptin to elicit LH release acting directly at the pituitary has been further documented in response to direct kisspeptin stimulation in rat gonadotropes), bovine and ovine species, even at the nM range [14,51,52]. Moreover, rat studies have suggested the expression and hormonal regulation of KiSS-1 gene at the pituitary [38], while in the sheep, kisspeptin has been detected in hypophysial portal blood [51]. On the latter, however, the lack of significant fluctuations in kisspeptin concentrations at key physiological states, such as the pre-ovulatory surge, has been interpreted as evidence for the lack of physiologic relevance of such direct pituitary effects [51]. Overall, while the dominant hypothalamic actions of kisspeptins on GnRH neurons is undisputed, the possibility of direct pituitary effects remains as a contentious issue that warrants further investigation.

studies have included: (i) the characterization of the effects of changes in the sex steroid milieu on the expression patterns of KiSS-1 (and GPR54) gene at the hypothalamus; and (ii) the identification of canonical sex steroid receptors in putative KiSS-1 neurons [39]. In addition, (iii) the activation of KiSS-1 neurons by sex steroids has also been evaluated in rodents [39].

The first evidence for the potential regulation of KiSS-1 gene expression at the hypothalamus by androgen and estrogen was obtained in rat studies using male and female models of gonadectomy (GNX), with or without sex steroid replacement. Thus, GNX induced a significant rise in KiSS-1 mRNA levels at the hypothalamus that coincided with the expected rise in circulating levels of gonadotropin. In addition, sex steroid replacement of GNX rats was sufficient to prevent both hormonal (LH) and gene expression (KiSS-1) responses [30]. By the use of in situ hybridization analyses in rats and mice, the above changes (detected by semi-Q RT-PCR in whole hypothalamic fragments) were located to the arcuate nucleus (ARC) [21,49,50], a key hypothalamic center for the integration of a wide array of peripheral regulators of the gonadotropic axis. Interestingly enough, later studies in sheep and primates (including humans) have confirmed the putative role of KiSS-1 neurons at the hypothalamic infundibular/arcuate nucleus in conveying the negative feedback effects of sex steroids also in other mammalian species [44,48].

### 4. KiSS-1/kisspeptins and the feedback control of gonadotropin secretion in rodents

Further proof for the physiologic relevance of kisspeptin signaling in the control of gonadotropin secretion came from rodent studies addressing the potential involvement of this system in mediating the feedback effects of sex steroids. These

Notwithstanding, *in situ* hybridization analyses in rodents disclosed also that a discrete neuronal population expressing KiSS-1 that is located at the AVPV responds to sex steroids in a diametrically opposite manner: KiSS-1 mRNA expression at this site decreases after GNX and increases following estradiol supplementation [49,50]. These observations immediately raised the possibility that KiSS-1 neurons at the AVPV might be mechanistically involved in the generation of the pre-ovulatory surge, induced by the preceding rise of circulating estradiol. Indeed, during the last 2 years, compelling evidence has been gathered, in different physiologic rodent models, supporting that contention; findings that are exhaustively revised by Tsukamura and Maeda in this Special Issue. Overall, the data available evidence that estrogen is capable to activate the transcription of KiSS-1 gene, thereby inducing an increase in KiSS-1/kisspeptin expression that enhances the secretory activity of GnRH neurons, and thus triggers the pre-ovulatory surge of gonadotropins [39]. As revised by Kaufmann elsewhere in this Special Issue, development of KiSS-1 neurons at the AVPV is exceedingly higher in adult female rodents, thus providing the potential basis for the sexual dimorphism in the ability of estrogen to induce positive feed-back, which is selectively detected in the female [23]. The molecular mechanisms whereby the same regulator (estrogen) is able to increase KiSS-1 mRNA in AVPV neurons while it decreases its expression at the ARC remain unsolved, although it is apparent that this is not related with a differential pattern of expression of α and β forms of estrogen receptors (ER) between these two hypothalamic sites. Moreover, pharmacological and functional genomic studies in rats and mice have demonstrated that the regulatory actions of estrogen on the hypothalamic expression of KiSS-1 gene are mediated via ERα [30,41,60].

proestrus [40,41]. These observations are in good agreement with recent data in GNX mice, where estrogen has been shown to enhance kisspeptin-stimulated GnRH neuronal activity [35]. Overall, these observations evidence that, in addition to transcriptional effects on KiSS-1 gene, estrogen is able to increase the responsiveness of GnRH neurons to kisspeptin stimulation; a phenomenon that is likely to contribute to the full expression of the pre-ovulatory surge of gonadotropins. Indeed, it has been recently demonstrated that neuronal ERα signaling is indispensable for the induction of LH surges by estrogen [60]. In this context, it is tempting to hypothesize that part of this stimulatory action is mediated via its ability to enhance GnRH responsiveness to kisspeptin.

Interestingly, in contrast to ERα, antagonization of ERβ in cyclic female rats failed to alter the endogenous pre-ovulatory surge of LH and to block ovulation, but significantly enhanced the magnitude of acute LH responses to kisspeptin [41]. Moreover, modest, but detectable, inhibitory effects on LH responses to kisspeptin were observed in GNX female rats supplemented with a selective ERβ agonist. In striking contrast, selective blockade of ERβ attenuated FSH responses to kisspeptin in cyclic female rats at proestrus [40]. Altogether, the above data illustrates the complexity of ER signaling in setting GnRH/ gonadotropin responsiveness to kisspeptin, with a dominant positive role of ERα, but a dual mode of action of ERβ: subtle inhibitory effect on LH secretion [41]; moderate stimulatory effect on FSH secretion [40]. The former may operate as negative modifier of GnRH/LH responses to kisspeptin; a phenomenon that could contribute to partially restrain LH secretion at certain physiological states. In addition, the differential roles of ERβ signaling on LH and FSH secretion might be mechanistically relevant for the dissociation of gonadotropin secretion at the preovulatory phase of the cycle, at least in rodents [40].

Finally, as mentioned above, administration of progesterone together with estrogen (or selective ERα ligands) to GNX female rats induced a state of maximal responsiveness to kisspeptin in terms of LH secretion [41,42]. The mechanisms for such a stimulatory action of progesterone are unclear, but might reflect its pituitary effects, rather than primary changes in GnRH responsiveness to kisspeptin, as suggested by comparative analyses on the effects of kisspeptin and GnRH itself following antagonization of progesterone receptors (PR) [41]. In this sense, it is well known that PRs at the gonadotrope are essential for the generation of GnRH self-priming and the pre-ovulatory surge. Worthy to note, despite the documented roles of progesterone in the negative and positive feedback regulation of gonadotropin secretion in the female, the effects of this sex steroid on the expression of KiSS-1 gene, at different hypothalamic nuclei, have not been reported to date in rodents. Yet, expression analyses in the sheep have documented the ability of progesterone to partially suppress KiSS-1 mRNA levels in the ARC [48].

5. Modulation of GnRH/gonadotropin responses to kisspeptins by sex steroids

In addition to the transcriptional effects described above, evidence is also mounting that sex steroids are able to modulate net GnRH/gonadotropin responsiveness to kisspeptin in the female rat; a phenomenon that might contribute also to the generation of the pre-ovulatory surge of gonadotropins [41]. In this sense, recent pharmacologic and electrophysiological studies in rats and mice have jointly pointed out that relative GnRH/LH responses to kisspeptin are decreased in GNX animals, while estrogen replacement is able to rescue the state of maximal responsiveness [35,41]. Indeed, using GNX rats, we have demonstrated that the combined administration of estradiol (or a selective agonist of ERα) and progesterone induces supra-maximal LH responses to kisspeptin [41,42]; a phenomenon that is in line with previous findings of our group in cyclic female rats that showed cycle-dependent fluctuations in the pattern of gonadotropin responses to kisspeptin, with maximal LH responsiveness during the proestrus-to-estrus transition, i.e., at the time of the pre-ovulatory surge [42]. Moreover, using a selective antagonist of ERα, we have recently shown that acute blockade of ERα signaling does not only impede the generation of the pre-ovulatory surge and subsequent ovulation, but induces also a marked decrease in net LH and FSH responses to kisspeptin in cyclic female rats at

6. Kisspeptins: putative targets for pharmacological manipulation of gonadotropic axis?

The physiologic and pharmacological features of the KiSS-1/GPR54 system, as major stimulator of gonadotropin secretion

acting primarily on GnRH neurons, have led to the proposal that kisspeptins may constitute a suitable target for therapeutic intervention of the gonadotropic axis [39]. Indeed, manipulation of the KiSS-1 system (with either activation or antagonization) might be theoretically beneficial in a diversity of pathological conditions, including puberty disorders, endocrine-related tumors, endometriosis and ovarian insufficiency. Admittedly, some of those conditions are currently treated by using GnRH analogs. Yet, it must be recognized also that activation of GPR54 signaling by kisspeptins, as a mean to stimulate gonadotropin secretion, might hold optimal physiologic characteristics vs. stimulation of the gonadotropic axis by pharmacological boluses of GnRH, as the former is likely to induce the secretion of the endogenous releasable pool of GnRH.

In the above context, different experimental studies in rodents, published to date, clearly illustrate on the potential usefulness of kisspeptin analogs in the manipulation of the gonadotropic axis. Thus, in addition to the potent gonadotropin-releasing effects of a single bolus described in previous sections, protocols of repeated administration of kisspeptin-10 in rats (four boluses of 30 nmol/kg BW every 75 min) were able to induce a pattern of repeated LH pulses, without decrement in terms of amplitude, duration or secretory mass, thus providing the basis for the design of procedures for robust, short-term activation of the gonadotropic axis [59]. Interestingly, these observations are in line with reports in juvenile monkeys and female sheep, where intermittent injections of short-term infusions of kisspeptins have been shown to elicit sustained LH secretory responses [1,36]. The therapeutic interest of the above findings is reinforced by the fact that such responses were obtained after systemic administration of kisspeptins, which further stresses the feasibility of the design of amenable protocols of pharmacological intervention based on the use of GPR54 agonists.

At the other extreme of the spectrum of gonadotropin responses to kisspeptins, protocols of chronic subcutaneous administration of kisspeptin to male rats have been reported to down-regulate the gonadotropic axis, with extinguished LH responses within 48 h and testicular atrophy in the long-term (13-days of infusion) [55]. Likewise, protocols of continuous infusion of kisspeptin in monkeys have evidenced that LH secretory responses to kisspeptin may desensitize also in primates [45]; a finding of potential therapeutic interest given the lack of antagonists of GPR54. The mechanisms of such desensitization remain to be fully solved, although the possibility of down-regulation of GPR54 has been suggested. Anyhow, we have recently obtained evidence that gonadotropin responses to continuous administration of kisspeptin do vary depending on the hormone (LH vs. FSH), the stage of sexual maturation (puberty vs. adulthood) and the functional state of the gonadotropic axis (fed ad libitum vs. undernutrition) [43]. Thus, in our experiments, the loss of LH stimulation after continuous kisspeptin exposure was accompanied by persistent elevation of FSH levels all through the infusion period in adult female rats. These observations strongly suggest that potential desensitization of gonadotropin responses to kisspeptin does not solely involve downregulation at the receptor level, but may include also changes

on the patterns of GnRH secretion; a possibility of pharmacological interest that merits further investigation.

Additional efforts in this pharmacological front include the identification/development and biological testing of analogs of endogenous kisspeptins, with either agonistic or antagonistic activity. Given the original recognition of their anti-metastatic properties, peptidergic analogs of kisspeptins, of low-molecular weight, have been designed [33,57,58]. Yet, biological testing of those compounds has been restricted to heterologous cell reporter systems and, to our knowledge, analyses of promising candidates (such as compounds FM059a and C-34) in terms of induction of gonadotropin secretion in rodent models have not been reported to date, and are currently in progress in our laboratory. Similarly, natural products with ability to activate or inactivate GPR54 in vitro might be optimal candidates for in vivo testing. Finally, generation of full antagonists of GPR54 is eagerly awaited, as these may provide: (i) an optimal tool for physiologic studies on the roles of kisspeptins in the control of the gonadotropic axis, as well as on related and non-related systems; and (ii) a therapeutic option for a diversity of pathological conditions where GnRH analogs are currently in use.

### 7. Conclusions

In this review, we have summarized the state-of-the-art of a particular aspect of KiSS-1 physiology that has drawn considerable attention in the last years; namely, the roles of kisspeptins as essential regulators of gonadotropin secretion and, hence, putative pharmacological targets for therapeutic intervention of the reproductive axis. In this context, molecular and pharmacological studies in rodents, as revised herein, have paved the way for the characterization of the indispensable function of kisspeptins, and their receptor GPR54, in the regulation of gonadotropin secretion in mammals, in both sexes, at different stages of sexual development and under different functional states. Indeed, some of the observations originally made in laboratory rodents have been replicated and confirmed in other mammalian species, including humans. For instance, as it was originally described in mice and rats, KiSS-1 neurons at the infundibular/arcuate nucleus seems to be involved in the negative feedback regulation of gonadotropin secretion in human and non-human primates [44]. Likewise, as it is the case in cyclic female rats, maximal gonadotropin responses to kisspeptin have been detected at the pre-ovulatory phase of the menstrual cycle in women [9]. Overall, such commonalities in the physiology of kisspeptins across mammals reinforce the potential for clinical translation of data arising from experimental rodent studies, which are likely to continue and expand in the years to come.
