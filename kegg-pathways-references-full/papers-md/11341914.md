## Abstract

Fungal homoserine dehydrogenase (HSD) is required for the biosynthesis of threonine, isoleucine and methionine from aspartic acid, and is a target for antifungal agents. HSD from the yeast *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* was overproduced in *Escherichia coli* and 25 mg of soluble dimeric enzyme was purified per liter of cell culture in two steps. HSD efficiently reduces aspartate semialdehyde to homoserine (Hse) using either NADH or NADPH with $k_{\text{cat}}/K_{\text{m}}$ in the order of $10^{6-7} \, \text{M}^{-1} \, \text{s}^{-1}$ at pH 7.5. The rate constant of the reverse direction (Hse oxidation) was also significant at pH 9.0 ($k_{\text{cat}}/K_{\text{m}} \approx 10^{4-5} \, \text{M}^{-1} \, \text{s}^{-1}$) but was minimal at pH 7.5. Chemical modification of HSD with diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC) resulted in a loss of activity that could be obviated by the presence of substrates. UV difference spectra revealed an increase in absorbance at 240 nm for DEPC-modified HSD consistent with the modification of two histidines (His) per subunit. Amino acid sequence alignment of HSD illustrated the conservation of two His residues among HSDs. These residues, His79 and His309, were substituted to alanine (Ala) using site-directed mutagenesis. HSD H79A had similar steady-state kinetics to wild type, while $k_{\text{cat}}/K_{\text{m}}$ for HSD H309A decreased by almost two orders of magnitude. The recent determination of the X-ray structure of HSD revealed that His309 is located at the dimer interface [B. DeLaBarre, P.R. Thompson, G.D. Wright, A.M. Berghuis, Nat. Struct. Biol. 7 (2000) 238–244]. The His309Ala mutant enzyme was found in very high molecular weight complexes rather than the expected dimer by analytical gel filtration chromatography analysis. Thus the invariant His309 plays a structural rather than catalytic role in these enzymes.

# 1. Introduction

Clinical fungal infections have escalated dramatically in recent years [1]. The rise in immunocompromised individuals (e.g., organ and marrow transplant recipients, AIDS patients) has resulted in a significant surge in life-threatening fungal infections [2]. Treatment of these diseases is limited at present to very few agents: the polyenes (e.g., amphotericin), nucleotide analogues (e.g., 5-fluorouracil), and lanosterol 14α-demethylase inhibitors (e.g., fluconazole) [3]. As with all antimicrobial compounds, this limited number of agents is now being threatened by the emergence of drug-resistant organisms [4]. Plant pathogens resistant to antifungal agents are also a growing concern in agriculture [5]. Crop damage due to pre- and post-harvest fungal infections results in major losses throughout the world each year. There is therefore heightened interest in the identification and exploitation of new antifungal targets and drugs.

While sterol metabolism and the cell membrane continue to be useful targets, the identification of other important pathways is paramount for the development of new antifungal drugs. The biosynthesis of amino acids is one such target. For example, the pyridinamine fungicides are thought to inhibit cystathionine-β-lyase, an enzyme required for the biosynthesis of methionine (Met) [6]. It has also been demonstrated that the biosynthetic enzyme homoserine dehydrogenase (HSD) (EC 1.1.1.3) is the target for the antifungal natural product (S)-2-amino-4-oxo-5-hydroxypentanoic acid [7,8]. HSD catalyzes a critical common step in the synthesis of the amino acids threonine (Thr), isoleucine (Ile), and Met (Scheme 1), amino acids that are not synthesized by humans. Thus, the Met biosynthetic pathway is a proven target for the development of antifungal agents.

HSD was first characterized in yeast cell-free extracts over 40 years ago [9] and a five-step purification yielding 12 mg of enzyme from 0.5 kg of yeast cell paste was more recently described [10]. The gene encoding HSD in *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*, *hom6*, reveals a predicted 359 amino acid protein with a molecular weight of 38,505 Da [11], in good agreement with the size of 40,000 Da estimated from SDS-PAGE on the purified yeast enzyme [10]. The enzymatic characterization of *S. cerevisiae* HSD has been relatively cursory, limited only to \(K_m\) determinations in the homoserine (Hse) oxidizing mode.

On the other hand, the *Escherichia coli* bifunctional enzyme aspartokinase-homoserine dehydrogenase I (AKHSD I) has been studied in much more detail. Both kinase and dehydrogenase activities of this enzyme have been thoroughly characterized, and their kinetic mechanisms determined [12–14]. Chemical modification and pH studies suggest that histidine (His) and tyrosine (Tyr) residues are involved in the kinase active site [15]. The functional amino acid residues involved in the dehydrogenase activity of AKHSD I, however, have not yet been identified, thus the structural basis for substrate recognition and catalysis is unknown.

We have recently reported the 3D structure of yeast HSD determined by X-ray crystallographic methods [16]. This structure has greatly assisted in our understanding of the biochemistry of HSD; however, further exploration of this enzyme as a target for antifungal drugs requires a much more thorough delineation of enzyme action. We report here the overexpression of *S. cerevisiae* enzyme in *E. coli*, which has permitted large-scale purification for the analysis of the steady-state kinetic properties of the enzyme and the identification of His309 as an important amino acid residue in maintaining appropriate protein integrity.

### 2.2. Preparation of aspartate semialdehyde (ASA)

L-ASA was prepared by modification of the method of Tudor et al. [17]. Briefly, L-allylglycine was converted first to the N-tert-butoxycarbonyl derivative and then to the p-methoxybenzyl ester by standard techniques. The resulting diprotected allylglycine derivative was then converted to L-ASA in two steps.

#### 2.2.1. L-N-tert-Butoxycarbonylaspartic acid β-semialdehyde p-methoxybenzyl ester

L-N-tert-Butoxycarbonylallylglycine p-methoxybenzyl ester (2.18 g; 6.48 mmol) in CH₂Cl₂ (65 ml) was ozonized (1.5 h) at −78°C and excess ozone was removed with argon. The protected amino acid ozonide was decomposed (−78°C) by the addition of anhydrous triethylamine (2 equivalents) followed by stirring at 23°C for 5 h. Methylene chloride was removed in vacuo and the crude material was directly purified by flash silica gel chromatography using ethyl acetate as eluent to give the protected L-ASA as a clear oil, 941 mg (43% yield), Rf 0.65 (1:1 ethyl acetate:hexane) or Rf 0.42 (9:1 CHCl₃:EtOAc). ¹H Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) (200 MHz, CDCl₃): 1.41 (9H, s), 3.04 (2H, t), 3.79 (3H, s), 4.60 (1H, m), 5.12 (2H, s), 5.40 (1H, br, d), 6.88, 7.25 (4H, m), 9.71 (1H, s). IR (CHCl₃): 3437, 3028, 2982, 1714, 1614, 1516 cm⁻¹. MS (ESMS): m/z (%) = 338.18 (MH⁺, 100%), 282.05 (23%), 120.98 (52%); C₁₇H₂₃NO₆ requires 337.15.

#### 2.2.2. L-Aspartic acid β-semialdehyde hydrate trifluoroacetate (L-ASA)

A solution of protected semialdehyde (941 mg; 2.79 mmol) in CH₂Cl₂ (20 ml) was cooled to 0°C.
Trifluoroacetic acid (19 ml) was added under argon as the solution warmed to room temperature, and stirring was continued for an additional 2 h. The solvent was removed in vacuo to give a yellow oily residue. This was partitioned between water (75 ml) and ethyl acetate (75 ml). The aqueous layer was separated and washed with ethyl acetate (2 × 75 ml). Removal of the water in vacuo gave the hydrated semialdehyde as an orange solid, 542 mg (78% yield). ${}^{1}$H NMR (500 MHz, D$_{2}$O): δ = 2.10 (2H, m), 3.96 (1H, dd), 5.18 (1H, t). IR (KBr): 3429, 3120, 1688, 1645, 1400 cm$^{-1}$; MS (ESMS): $m/z$ (%) = 136.06 (M$^{+}$; 50%), 118.07 (M-H$_{2}$O; 100%); C$_{4}$H$_{10}$NO$_{4}$ requires 136.06.

### 2.3. Preparation of HSD (hom6) overexpression construct

S. cerevisiae DL1 served as the source for chromosomal DNA for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of the hom6 gene. The yeast was grown overnight at 30°C in 50 ml YPD, harvested by centrifugation and washed twice with cold sterile water. Cells were flash frozen, then ground with a mortar and pestle in liquid N$_{2}$ and resuspended in 5 ml lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.6, 5 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, 5% SDS). Phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:25:1) (10 ml) was added to the lysed cells, mixed gently for 20 min at 30°C and centrifuged at 5000 × g for 10 min. The organic layer was re-extracted with 4 ml lysis buffer, the aqueous phases were pooled and extracted another three times with phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol. Nucleic acids were subsequently precipitated by adding 0.1 volumes of 2 M potassium acetate and 2.5 volumes of absolute ethanol and storing overnight at −20°C. After centrifuging (4000 × g for 20 min) the pellet was washed with 70% ethanol and dried in vacuo. The pellet was then dissolved in 7 ml cold 3 M LiCl and stored for 2 days at 4°C to precipitate RNA which was then removed by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 30 min. DNA was precipitated from the supernatant by adding 25 ml absolute ethanol and stored overnight at −20°C. After centrifugation at 4000 × g for 20 min the pelleted chromosomal DNA was washed with 70% ethanol, dried and resuspended in 0.75 ml 10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA pH 8.0.

The HSD overexpression plasmid, pCP13, was prepared by PCR amplification of the hom6 gene, encoding S. cerevisiae HSD [11]. PCR primers were designed to complement the 5′-(5′-GCTCT-AGACATATGAGCACTAAAGTTGTTAATG-3′) and 3′-(5′-CGGGATCCTCAC-TAAAGTCTTTGA-GCAATCTTG-3′) ends of the hom6 open reading frame and to incorporate XbaI, NdeI (underlined and bold, respectively, in the 5′ primer) and BamHI (underlined in the 3′ primer) restriction sites for subcloning. The hom6 gene was amplified from genomic DNA of S. cerevisiae DL1, using Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs). The resulting 1.1 kb fragment was digested with NdeI and BamHI and ligated into the expression vector pET-22b(+) (Novagen, Madison, WI, USA) linearized with the same restriction endonucleases. This expression vector places the hom6 gene under the control of the bacteriophage T7 promoter and the lac operator. The gene was completely sequenced to confirm the absence of mutations and the resulting recombinant plasmid, pCP13, was used to transform E. coli BL21 (DE3).

### 2.4. Site directed mutagenesis

The recombinant plasmids, pHSD79 and pHSD309, encoding HSDH79A and HSDH309A mutants, respectively, were prepared by the Quick Change protocol (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA). pHSD79 and pHSD309 were generated by native Pfu DNA polymerase using pCP13 as template and primers encoding the mutations (pHSD79: 5′-GGATGATTTAATTGCTGCTTTGAAGACTTCACC-3′ and 5′-GGTGAA-GTCTTCAAAGCAGCAAT-TAAATCATCC-3′; pHSD309: 5′-GTACGATTA-CTCA-GCCCCATTCCGCATCATTG-3′ and 5′-CAATGATGCGAATGGGGGCTGAGTAATCG-TAC-3′; mutated bases are underlined). Following the reaction, the template (pCP13) was removed by digestion with DpnI and the mixture was used to transform E. coli XL1-Blue. Hom6 was sequenced in both constructs to determine the presence of the His→alanine (Ala) mutation and to confirm the absence of other mutations. For overexpression, pHSD79 and pHSD309 were used to transform E. coli BL21 (DE3).

2.5. **Purification of HSD**

All purification steps were carried out at 4°C. Buffers were brought to the correct pH with HCl at room temperature.

An overnight culture of *E. coli* BL21 (DE3)/pCP13 (20 ml) served as inoculum for 2 l of Luria broth containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. The culture was grown at 37°C at 250 rpm to an absorbance of 0.4 at 600 nm. The cell culture was then cooled to 30°C in an ice bath and sterile isopropyl β-D-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mM. The cells were grown for an additional 4 h at 30°C at 250 rpm and then harvested by centrifugation at 5000×g for 15 min. The cell pellet was washed with 25 ml of ice-cold 0.85% NaCl and then resuspended in 10 ml lysis buffer (10 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mM β-mercaptoethanol) and lysed by three passages through a French pressure cell. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 10000×g for 20 min. The supernatant was applied to a Q-Sepharose Fast Flow (Pharmacia) column (2.5×11 cm), equilibrated with 10 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA (buffer A). HSD did not bind and was washed from the column with 150 ml buffer A. Fractions containing HSD, as determined by enzyme assay, were pooled and concentrated to 2 ml using an Amicon PM30 Diaflo ultrafiltration membrane, followed by an Amicon Centriprep 10 concentrator. The concentrated protein was then applied to a Sephacryl S-200 (Pharmacia) column (2.5×110 cm) equilibrated with 10 mM TAPS pH 8.5. HSD-containing fractions were identified by activity assay, pooled and concentrated as described above. Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford [18]. The purified enzyme was stored at 0°C or frozen in 5% glycerol at −20°C where it was stable for several months.

HSD mutants H79A and H309A were purified as described above from 1 l cultures of *E. coli* BL21 (DE3)/pHSD79 and *E. coli* BL21 (DE3)/pHSD309, respectively. To increase soluble expression of protein, the cultures were heat shocked at 45°C by the addition of 200 ml boiling Luria broth and then expression was induced with 0.5 mM isopropyl β-D-thiogalactopyranoside.

2.6. **Molecular weight determination of purified HSD**

Samples of purified wild type HSD were applied to a Superdex 200 column (HR 10/30) (Pharmacia) run at 0.4 ml/min in 50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA. Carbonic anhydrase, bovine serum albumin, β-amylase and blue dextran were used to construct the standard curve from which the native molecular weight of HSD was estimated.

The accurate molecular mass was determined by electrospray mass spectrometry on a Fisons VG Quattro II instrument using CH₃CN/H₂O (1:1) with 0.001% trifluoroacetic acid as solvent by L. Taylor at the University of Waterloo Mass Spectrometry facility.

---

2.7. **Enzyme assay**

During HSD purification, activity was measured in the reverse direction (D,L-Hse + NAD⁺ → ASA + NADH) by continuously monitoring the increase in absorbance at 340 nm at room temperature (25°C) using a Cary 3E UV-VIS spectrophotometer. The assay mixture contained 25 mM D,L-Hse, 0.2 mM NAD⁺ and 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 9.0 in a total volume of 995 μl. The reaction was initiated with 5 μl of partially purified enzyme.

For initial rate studies, both forward (ASA + NAD(P)H → Hse + NAD(P)⁺) and reverse reactions were monitored for the disappearance or the appearance of NAD(P)H at 340 nm. In the forward direction, the assay mixture contained 100 mM HEPES buffer, pH 7.5 and varying amounts of ASA and NAD(P)H in a total volume of 980 μl. ASA was held constant at 0.8 mM as a fixed second substrate, while NAD(P)H was held at 0.2 mM as a second substrate. In the reverse direction, the assay mixture contained 100 mM CHES, pH 9.5 and varying amounts of L-Hse and NAD(P)⁺ in a total volume of 980 μl. L-Hse was held constant at 20 mM as a fixed second substrate, while NADP⁺ and NAD⁺ were held at 8.0 and 0.3 mM, respectively, as saturating substrates. When HSD mutants were assayed, NAD⁺ concentration was held at 0.4 mM as a fixed second substrate. The reaction was initiated by adding 20 μl purified enzyme (wild type HSD: 0.1 μg for the forward reaction, 1 μg for the reverse reaction.

HSD H79A: 0.33 μg for the forward reaction, 1.5 μg for the reverse reaction; HSD H309A: 8 μg for the forward reaction, 33 μg for the reverse reaction).

When measuring the effect of KCl on kinetic parameters, assays were prepared as above with varying concentrations of ASA, 0.2 mM NADH and 0, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 750 or 1000 mM KCl. All assays were done in duplicate.

### 2.8. Data analysis

Initial rates were obtained directly from the progress curves using the Cary 3.00 software and duplicate rates were analyzed by nonlinear least squares regression to Eq. 1 or 2 using Grafit 3.0 [19]. Parameters obtained from the best fit were reported with standard errors.

\[
\nu = V_{\text{max}} S / (K_m + S)
\]
(1)

\[
\nu = V_{\text{max}} S / (K_m + S + S^2 / K_I)
\]
(2)

where \(\nu\) is the measured velocity, \(V_{\text{max}}\) is the maximal velocity, \(S\) is the varied substrate concentration, \(K_m\) is the Michaelis-Menten constant, and \(K_I\) is the substrate inhibition constant.

### 2.9. Chemical modification studies of wild type HSD

Chemical modification of wild type HSD was performed with several reagents to explore the participation of reactive amino acid side chains in catalysis. Purified HSD (0.7 μg) was incubated with 1.25 or 2.5 mM PLP in 100 mM NaHCO₃, pH 8.0, 2.5 mM EDC in 100 mM MES, pH 6.0 in a total volume of 100 μl for 1 h at 25°C. Phenylglyoxal (10 mM) was added to 0.7 μg purified HSD in 100 mM NaHCO₃, pH 8.0 in 100 μl and allowed to react for 30 min at 25°C. HSD activity was measured as previously by adding 20 μl modified HSD to an assay containing 0.8 mM ASA, 0.2 mM NADH and 100 mM HEPES, pH 7.5 and compared to control incubations containing no modifier. Substrate protection was determined by the addition of substrates to the HSD solution prior to the addition of PLP or phenylglyoxal.

DEPC and TNM stock solutions were made in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and ethanol, respectively. Purified HSD (0.7 μg) was treated with 2.5 or 10 mM DEPC in 100 mM phosphate buffer, pH 6.0 or with 2.5 or 10 mM TNM in 100 mM NaHCO₃, pH 8.0 for 30 min at 25°C. Ten μl DEPC/DMSO or TNM/ethanol were added to incubations having a total volume of 100 μl. Controls were prepared containing HSD in the appropriate buffer and 10 μl DMSO or ethanol. These solvents had little effect on enzyme activity at this concentration. HSD activity was measured as described above and compared to controls. Substrate protection was determined by the addition of substrates to the HSD solution prior to the addition of DEPC or TNM.

Difference wavelength scans were performed with DEPC-treated HSD at 25°C. Wavelength scans were taken at between 220 and 350 nm of purified HSD (1.7 mg) in 100 mM phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, 10% DMSO and subtracted from the same solution containing 2.5 mM DEPC. Scans were taken at 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0 and 8.0 min after the addition of DEPC and DMSO.

### 2.10. Amino acid sequence alignment of HSD

Amino acid sequences of HSD/AKHSD from various sources were obtained by searching the NCBI GenBank database. Sequence alignment was performed by ClustalW (http://www2.ebi.ac.uk/clustalw/) [20]. The resulting phylogenetic tree and sequence alignment were viewed using TreeView version 1.5.2 (http://taxonomy.zoology.gla.ac.uk/rod/

## 3. Results

### 3.1. Overproduction, purification and characterization of S. cerevisiae HSD

In order to obtain an adequate supply of HSD for mechanistic and structural studies, we sought to prepare an overexpressing construct in *E. coli*. We therefore amplified the *hom6* gene from *S. cerevisiae* genomic DNA by PCR and inserted it into an appropriate vector, pET-22b, which places the gene downstream from an inducible bacteriophage T7 promoter and the optimal bacteriophage T7 gene 10 ribosome binding site. The resulting construct, pCP13, gave excellent overproduction of the yeast enzyme in *E. coli*. A rapid two-step purification method (anion exchange and size exclusion chromatography) gave over 25 mg of pure HSD per litre of cell culture (Table 1 and Fig. 1).

The enzyme mass, as determined by electrospray mass spectrometry, was found to be 38,374.32 ± 3.39 Da in excellent agreement with the predicted mass of the enzyme lacking the N-terminal Met (38,374.70). The enzyme purified from natural abundance in *S. cerevisiae* was reported to be a dimer [10] and our recombinant enzyme also behaved as a dimer by size exclusion chromatography, consistent with the X-ray structure [16].

The SDS-polyacrylamide gel (11%) was stained with Coomassie blue R-250. Lanes: 1, molecular weight standards (kDa); 2, whole cell lysate; 3, Q Sepharose; 4, Sephacryl S-200.

**Fig. 2. Effect of KCl on kinetic parameters of yeast HSD.** ASA concentrations were varied at several fixed KCl concentrations in the presence of 0.2 mM NADH, 100 mM HEPES pH 7.5 and 0.1 μg HSD. \( k_{\text{cat}} \) (A), \( K_m \) (B) and \( K_i \) (C) for ASA were obtained from best fits to Eq. 2. Error bars represent the standard error for the best fit parameters. Lines represent the results of linear regression analyses of the parameters with respect to KCl concentrations.

### 3.2. Steady state kinetics of wild type HSD

The purified enzyme could be assayed in either the forward, ASA reducing, or reverse, Hse oxidizing, directions with ease. The pH optimum determined under saturating substrate concentrations was pH 7.5 in the forward direction while it was >pH 9.5.

in the reverse reaction. Measured at the optimal pH, the forward reaction was favored, having \( k_{\text{cat}}/K_m \) equal to \( 10^6 - 10^7 \, \text{M}^{-1} \, \text{s}^{-1} \), whereas the reverse reaction had \( k_{\text{cat}}/K_m \) equal to \( 10^4 - 10^5 \, \text{M}^{-1} \, \text{s}^{-1} \) (Table 2). In both cases, the non-phosphorylated nicotinamide was the preferred substrate having a four-fold lower \( K_m \) and a three-fold greater \( k_{\text{cat}}/K_m \) in the forward direction and a 14-fold lower \( K_m \) and a 15-fold greater \( k_{\text{cat}}/K_m \) in the reverse direction. The nicotinamide substrate also demonstrated an effect on the Michaelis-Menten constant for L-Hse, \( K_m \) for L-Hse was almost two times larger with NADP⁺ than NAD⁺.

HSD was substrate inhibited in the forward reaction by ASA (\( K_i = 3.79 \, \text{mM} \)) with NADH as the cofactor. The addition of monovalent cations (K⁺, Na⁺) increased both \( K_m \) and \( K_i \) for substrates in the forward reaction, but had no effect on \( k_{\text{cat}} \) (Fig. 2). Extensive dialysis against EDTA or in the presence of Chelex 20 resin (BioRad) had no effect on enzyme activity and there was no evidence of additional tightly bound metals such as those found in other dehydrogenases, e.g. Zn²⁺, by inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometry analysis.

### 3.3. Chemical modification studies

Chemical modification of amino acid residues in yeast HSD was performed to identify functional amino acid residues (Table 3). PLP, which reacts with lysine (Lys) residues to form Schiff bases, decreased HSD activity only to 75% after 1 hour and the presence of the cofactor NAD⁺ offered very little protection. Similarly, EDC, which reacts with carboxylate residues (aspartic acid (Asp) and glutamic acid (Glu)), also had very little effect on HSD activity. Modification of arginine (Arg) residues with phenylglyoxal decreased HSD activity to 63%, however, amino acid or nicotinamide substrates did not protect against inactivation.

DEPC and TNM, which generally target His and Tyr residues, respectively, demonstrated a more dramatic effect on HSD activity. Only 31 and 42% HSD activity remained after 30 minutes incubation with 2.5 mM DEPC or TNM and activity decreased further to 3 and 19% with 10 mM DEPC or TNM. Neither 5 mM NAD⁺ nor 5 mM D,L-Hse protected HSD from inactivation by TNM as activities remained reduced.

* **a** Reactions in the forward, NAD(P)H oxidizing direction were conducted at pH 7.5 while the reverse, NAD(P)H reducing reactions were performed at pH 9.5. Kinetic parameters were obtained by fitting data to Eq. 1, except in the case of variable ASA with saturating NADH which exhibited substrate inhibition and thus was fit to Eq. 2.
* **b** The unexpected difference in \( k_{\text{cat}} \) may reflect ASA substrate inhibition.

maintained the same. On the other hand, 5 mM NAD⁺ contributed some protection of HSD from DEPC inactivation (23% HSD activity) and 5 mM D,L-Hse offered almost complete protection (81% HSD activity). Thus, of the five chemical modifying agents investigated, DEPC was the only reagent found to affect HSD activity in a manner which was partially reversed by the presence of substrates. Therefore, these experiments suggested the importance of DEPC-modifiable residues (e.g., His, Tyr) for optimal enzyme activity, although one must also consider possible reaction with other enzyme nucleophiles.

Interpretation of enzyme modification data by such reactive molecules as DEPC requires further validation to establish what residues are modified and whether this modification actually directly interferes with catalytically important groups. Therefore, in order to establish whether DEPC inactivation of HSD was a result of His residue modification, inactivation of the enzyme was monitored as a function of wavelength, which can be used to differentiate His versus Tyr modification [21] (Fig. 3). Difference spectra illustrated an increase in absorbance at 240 nm consistent with the formation of N-carbethoxyhistidine and no significant change was visible at 278 nm corresponding to Tyr modification. Modification of His residues by DEPC should be reversible with the addition of neutral hydroxylamine, however, in control studies hydroxylamine alone affected HSD activity and reactivation of HSD could not be tested as hydroxylamine alone resulted in HSD degradation (not shown). The absorbance difference at 240 nm

**Fig. 3.** Difference spectra for the modification of *S. cerevisiae* HSD by DEPC. The increasing absorbance at 240 nm is representative of N-carbethoxyhistidine formation. The curves were obtained at 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0, and 8.0 min, respectively, by incubating 1.7 mg HSD with 2.5 mM DEPC in 100 mM phosphate buffer, pH 6.0 and 10% DMSO at 25°C and subtracting the absorbance from the same solution containing no DEPC. Scans were taken at 0.5 (——), 1.0 (---), 2.0 (- - -), 4.0 (— — —) and 8.0 (— — — —) min.

predicted the modification of two His per HSD subunit, using an extinction coefficient of 3200 M⁻¹ cm⁻¹ [21]. While these data are consistent with His modification, we cannot rule out modification of other reactive nucleophiles. The chemical modification approach in toto did suggest the possible importance of His and therefore we explored this possibility further by additional experiments.

### 3.4. Amino acid sequence alignment and phylogenetic tree of HSD

The amino acid sequence of *S. cerevisiae* HSD was compared to sequences of HSD/AKHSD from various sources as a means to identify conserved amino acid residues. The phylogenetic tree (Fig. 4) illustrates that yeast HSD is most closely related to the bifunctional AKHSD family. This family includes AKHSD from *E. coli*, *Haemophilus influenzae*, *Serra-*

### 3.5. Steady state kinetics of HSD H79A and HSD H309A mutants

In order to determine the role of the conserved His residues, His → Ala mutations were introduced into yeast HSD. Both HSD H79A and HSD H309A mutants were purified and assayed in the forward and reverse directions. The replacement of His 79 with Ala appeared to have little effect on HSD activity.

as steady state kinetics for HSD H79A were similar to wild type HSD (Table 2). Although \(k_{\text{cat}}\) for either direction was two-fold lower for HSD H79A than wild type, rate constants \((k_{\text{cat}}/K_{\text{m}})\) for HSD H79A were equal to \(10^6-10^7 \, \text{M}^{-1} \, \text{s}^{-1}\) in the forward direction and \(10^4-10^5 \, \text{M}^{-1} \, \text{s}^{-1}\) in the reverse direction as seen with the wild type enzyme. On the other hand, the catalytic efficiency for the HSD H309A mutant was reduced by almost two orders of magnitude. \(k_{\text{cat}}/K_{\text{m}}\) values for HSD H309A were in the range \(10^4-10^6 \, \text{M}^{-1} \, \text{s}^{-1}\) for the forward reaction and \(10^3-10^4 \, \text{M}^{-1} \, \text{s}^{-1}\) for the reverse reaction. Since both HSD mutants have Michaelis constants comparable to wild type, with the exception of lower values in the reverse direction, the reduced rate constants for HSD H309A are largely a consequence of severely lowered \(k_{\text{cat}}\) values. Turnover numbers for the forward reac-

tion were reduced by approximately 40 times, whereas these numbers decreased by 20-fold for the reverse reaction. Lastly, substrate inhibition by ASA in the presence of NADH was not affected by mutation of His79, however, inhibition was eliminated by mutation of His309. These results suggest that His309, and not His79, is a residue important for HSD activity. In an effort to determine the oligomeric state of the His309 enzyme, analytical gel filtration chromatography was performed using Superdex 200. The mutant enzyme was found exclusively in the void volume indicating a molecular mass ≥ 600,000, suggesting that the active site monomer ratio was still 1:1 for this impaired enzyme.

# 4. Discussion

Prompted by the report that HSD was a potential target for antifungal compounds [7,8], we have initiated a study of the mechanism and structure of this enzyme from the yeast *S. cerevisiae*. Central to these studies was a requirement for an adequate supply of the enzyme in pure form. Our attempts at purification of enzyme from natural abundance in yeast proved unreliable and we therefore turned to overexpression in *E. coli*. The expression construct, pCP13, gave sufficient quantities (>25 mg/l of cell culture) of pure, active dimeric HSD for mechanistic and crystallization [16,22] studies.

The enzyme activity was readily measured in both the forward and reverse directions though the rates at neutral pH in the forward, physiologically relevant direction were significantly higher than in the reverse direction. Both the phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated nicotinamide cofactors were good substrates, but NAD(H) was slightly preferred. The substrates in the forward reaction have low $K_m$ values, which reflects very high affinities for the enzyme. Unlike previous results [8], ASA was a substrate inhibitor of HSD only with NADH as the cofactor. If nicotinamide release is largely rate-limiting, as is the case for many dehydrogenases, substrate inhibition is likely a result of ASA binding to the E·NAD⁺ complex, thereby forming an abortive ternary complex. Substrate inhibition may be more predominant with NADH as a result of a higher affinity of HSD for the resulting NAD⁺ than NADP⁺, which is implied by the 14-fold lower $K_m$ over NADP⁺. However, this inhibition likely has little physiological relevance as it occurs at concentrations greater than 4$K_m$.

Like *E. coli* AKHSD-1, yeast HSD is sensitive to K⁺ and Na⁺ ion concentrations. In the case of AKHSD-1, K⁺ is actually an activator and required

for activity [23], while Na⁺ is an inhibitor of this activation [14]. In contrast, K⁺ and Na⁺ ions have a similar effect on the *S. cerevisiae* HSD. Increased K⁺ or Na⁺ concentrations result in increased *K*ₘ for both ASA and NADH and increased substrate inhibition constant (*K*ᵢ) for ASA, but it has no effect on *k*ₐₜ. The structural basis for these effects is not known, but it does not appear to be due to dramatic changes in quaternary structure. One possibility is occupancy of the putative monovalent cation binding site in the loop region between helix α2H and strand βf of HSD [16].

The results of the chemical modification studies revealed that one or more His residues in HSD are essential for enzyme activity. Of several reagents tested, only DEPC, a reagent with selectivity towards His and Tyr [21], and TNM, a chemical that nitrates Tyr [24], produced considerable inactivation of HSD. These results are surprising as it is now known that the enzyme active site contains three carboxyl-containing residues, Glu208, Asp214, and Asp219 and one Lys (Lys223) which are important for catalysis [16], and underlines the caution that must be used when interpreting the results of non-specific chemical modifying agents. Nonetheless, since DEPC was the only modifying agent whose inactivating properties were attenuated by the presence of substrate, we further examined the DEPC-dependent inactivation. UV difference spectra comparing native and DEPC-treated HSD illustrated an increase in absorbance at 240 nm, characteristic for the formation of *N*-carbethoxyhistidine, and no significant decrease in absorbance at 278 nm corresponding to modification of Tyr residues was measured [21]. These results were consistent, but not unequivocal, with modification of His and prompted further examination of these residues in yeast HSD.

The phylogenetic tree of HSD/AKHSD proteins from various species determined that *S. cerevisiae* HSD was more closely related to bifunctional AKHSD enzymes. Sequence alignments of the HSD portion of these enzymes revealed that two out of three His residues in HSD are conserved (His79 and His309). As a result, HSD His → Ala mutants were prepared by site-directed mutagenesis and steady-state kinetics examined. Mutation of His79 had little effect on HSD kinetic parameters. Rate constants (*k*ₐₜ/*K*ₘ) in both forward and reverse directions were in the same order of magnitude as wild type HSD and *k*ₐₜ values were only two-fold lower. In contrast, replacement of His309 with Ala resulted in a dramatic decrease in catalytic efficiency and elimination of substrate inhibition. *k*ₐₜ/*K*ₘ values for HSD His309Ala in both directions were almost two orders of magnitude lower as a result of severe decreases in *k*ₐₜ. Turnover numbers for HSD H309A were about 40-fold lower than wild type in the forward direction and 20-fold lower in the reverse direction, suggesting that the mutation had a larger effect on the reduction of ASA. It is therefore evident that His309 plays an important role of yeast HSD activity.

The sensitivity of HSD to His modification suggested the possibility that His was playing a catalytic role, possibly as an active site acid/base as is common with many dehydrogenases [25,26]. However, the magnitude of *k*ₐₜ reduction (~40-fold) was not consistent with a direct role in catalysis where similar mutations result in a decrease in the order of 10⁴-fold in other dehydrogenases (e.g. [25,26]). In fact the X-ray structure of HSD has revealed that His79 and His309 are quite remote from the active site (Fig. 6). His79 is solvent exposed and thus it is not surprising that mutation had little effect on catalysis. On the other hand, His309, which is conserved in HSD enzymes, is found at the dimer interface. The His309Ala mutant in fact is no longer competent to form dimers, and complexes of ≥600,000 Da are observed. Thus the importance of this residue lies not in a role as an active site acid/base, but as a residue critical to enzyme integrity.

### 4.1. Significance

HSD has been highly expressed and efficiently purified such that milligram quantities are now available for mechanistic and structural studies. Steady state parameters in the forward and backward directions have been accurately determined for the first time and His309 was identified as an important residue for maintaining a catalytically optimal dimeric structure. These results complement the recent determination of the 3D structure of this enzyme, and provide the appropriate foundation for future examination of HSD as a possible target for new antifungal agents.
