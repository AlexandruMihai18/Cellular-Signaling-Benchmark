Millikan and Ruby, 2002; Yip et al., 2006; Morris and Visick, 2013). Because this stage of colonization is a critical step in establishing the symbiosis, much research has focused on the mechanisms by which V. fischeri cells form these squid-specific aggregates. Of note is the discovery of the 18 gene *syp* (
the ability to form the Syp biofilm is required for aggregate formation, it is not required for outcompeting colonization-incompetent species of bacteria that can also aggregate outside the light organ (Nyholm et al., 2000; Nyholm and McFall-Ngai, 2003; Altura et al., 2013). Hence, what Syp-independent mechanisms establish earlythat code for either regulatory or structural proteins (Figure 3). The sole Class I gene encodes FlrA, a transcriptional activator that controls expression of Class II genes in a manner that depends upon the alternative sigma factor, σ54. Two Class II regulatory proteins, FlrC and the alternative sigma factor σ28 (FliA), control expression of Class III and Class IV genes, respectively. Classes II,

Bowman et al., 2011). NO has been studied in mammals, where it controls cellular signaling and, importantly, participates in secondary reactions that produce antimicrobial RNS (Crane et al., 2010; Bowman et al., 2011; Figure 5). Presumably, all domains of life produce NO as phylogenetically-distinct organisms contain at least one gene thatwith NO reduced the severity of the growth arrest upon a second  
NO challenge. This result indicates that NO exposure can prime  
*V. fischeri* for subsequent NO challenges, and suggests that perhaps  
NO sensed by *V. fischeri* cells at the beginning of colonization may  
serve as a signal to prepare them for subsequent exposure to NO  
within the light organ (Wang et al., 2010

FIGURE 6 | Lux pathway controlling bioluminescence in *V. fischeri*. At low cell density, the sensor kinases AinR and LuxP/Q are predicted to exhibit net kinase activity leading to the
E. scolopes better than wild-type in competition experiments after 48 h (Fidopiastis et al., 2002; Miyashiro et al., 2010). However, in a different study, the same *litR* mutant exhibited a colonization disadvantage at an earlier, 12 h time point (Lupp and Ruby, 2005). Additionally
environmental signal within the light organ promotes bioluminescence? All of these subjects are active areas of research, and they will surely uncover new mechanisms that will expand the knowledge of how bacteria and a host establish a life-long, beneficial relationship.
