Glutathione protects cells and organisms from oxygen species and peroxides and is indispensable for aerobically living organisms. Moreover, it acts against xenobiotics and drugs by the formation and excretion of glutathione *S* conjugates. In this study, we show that the *yliA*, -*B*, -*C*, and -*D* genes of *Escherichia coli* K-12 encode a glutathione transporter with the ATP-binding cassette. The transporter imports extracellular glutathione into the cytoplasm in an ATP-dependent manner. This transporter, along with γ-glutamyltranspeptidase, has an important role in *E. coli* growth with glutathione as a sole sulfur source.

Glutathione (γ-glutamylcysteinylglycine; GSH) plays a leading role in the protection of cells and organisms by reducing oxygen species and peroxides and acts against xenobiotics and drugs by the formation and excretion of glutathione *S* conjugates (16). Because of its protective effect on organs, glutathione has been dispensed to patients with hepatic diseases in Japan. Glutathione and its derivatives are moved in and out of cells by transporters of several types. The glutathione importers Na⁺-dependent transporter (10) and H⁺ symporter (9) are known, and the only glutathione transporters with the ATP-binding cassette identified so far are glutathione *S* conjugate exporters (4). As for microbial glutathione transporter, *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* YCF1 of the vacuolar membrane is known as a glutathione *S*-conjugate transporter (14), which also transports reduced glutathione into vacuoles (20), and yeast HGT1 of the plasma membrane is known as a membrane-potential-dependent glutathione importer across the plasma membrane (3). However, there has been no report on the identification of bacterial glutathione transporter.

It has been shown that *Escherichia coli* cells grown in aerobic conditions contain a large amount of glutathione (7). *E. coli* synthesizes glutathione by the sequential actions of γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase (the product of *gshA*) and glutathione synthetase (the product of *gshB*) as in other organisms (1). It excretes glutathione into the culture medium during the exponential phase and the concentration of glutathione in the culture medium reaches maximum in the early stationary phase (18, 26), but thereafter, it is hydrolyzed by γ-glutamyltranspeptidase (GGT) in the periplasm to liberate glutamic acid and cysteinylglycine (22, 26). Cysteinylglycine is taken up into the cytoplasm and then cleaved into cysteine and glycine by aminopeptidases A, B, and N and dipeptidase D to be utilized as a source of cysteine and glycine (25). We have suggested that this is the salvage pathway of cysteine for *E. coli* (23). It was also shown by other researchers in a mammalian cell line (8) and in yeast (15) that GGT catalyzes the initial step of the cleavage of extracellular glutathione for use as a source of cysteine and nitrogen. However, even in the case of a GGT-deficient strain of *E. coli*, the concentration of glutathione in the culture medium decreased gradually after prolonged incubation. This finding prompted us to search for a glutathione transporter which had never been reported in bacteria.

The *ybiK* gene was reported as a member of the *cysB* regulon and it was suggested to encode a protein involved in glutathione transport or metabolism (19), but its mechanism is still unclear. GenBank suggests that four genes, *yliA*, -*B*, -*C*, and -*D*, located downstream of *ybiK*, are transcribed with *ybiK* (Fig. 1). EcoCyc (11) suggests that YliA, -*B*, -*C*, and -*D* are uncharacterized members of the ATP-binding cassette superfamily transporters. It suggests that *yliA* and -*B* encode the ATP-binding component and periplasmic binding protein, respectively, and that *yliC* and -*D* encode the plasma membrane components. From the above information, we speculated that YliA, -*B*, -*C*, and -*D* might encode the glutathione transporter. In this report, we present evidence indicating that *yliA*, -*B*, -*C*, and -*D* indeed encode a novel type of glutathione transporter.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Bacterial strains, phage, plasmids, and oligonucleotides. The bacterial strains, phage, plasmids, and oligonucleotides used in this study are listed in Table 1. Luria-Bertani (LB) broth (Miller) (17) purchased from Becton Dickinson was used regularly. M9 glucose medium (17) was used as a minimal medium. MgCl₂ was used instead of MgSO₄ when the effect of Δ*yliAB* mutation on the cell growth was measured. Ampicillin, tetracycline, and kanamycin were added at 100, 10, and 30 μg/ml, respectively, when appropriate. The bacteria were grown at 37°C with reciprocal shaking at 100 rpm.

Strain and plasmid construction. P1 transduction, DNA manipulation, and transformation were performed by the standard methods (17, 21). Gene disruption was performed according to the method of Datsenko and Wanner (5). Briefly, a Δ*yliAB* strain was constructed as follows. The DNA fragment of Kohara clone (12) #208 containing the *yliA* gene region was cloned onto pUC18 to obtain pSH1517. The FRT-Kan'-FRT fragment was amplified by PCR using oligonucleotides pKD13-1 and pKD13-4 as primers and pKD13 as a template with ExTaq DNA polymerase (Takara, Kyoto, Japan). The fragment was blunt ended with a blunting kit (Takara, Kyoto, Japan) and ligated with the 3.1-kb NruI and SacII (blunt-ended) fragment of pSH1517, which deleted most of the *yliA*

Transport assay. Transport assay was performed as described previously (13) using \[^{35}S\]glutathione (final concentration, 2 nM; 35.4 Tbq/mmol; PerkinElmer) except M9 glucose medium was used instead of M63 medium. When the effects of verapamil (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto Japan) and carbonyl cyanide- *m*-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto Japan) were determined, cells were preincubated in the presence of these chemicals for 30 min at 37°C prior to the addition of labeled glutathione.

The region of DNA deleted in our Δ*yliAB* mutation is shown by the bar above the genes. Gene names in parentheses are the new names proposed, after glutathione importer.

**RESULTS**

Effect of Δ*ggt* and Δ*yliAB* on the concentration of extracellular glutathione. Since the wild-type *E. coli* accumulates only several μM glutathione at a maximum in the medium and it is difficult to measure such a low concentration of glutathione, the strains were transformed with a plasmid, pSH1391, which contains the *gshA* and *gshB* genes on pBR322, to overproduce glutathione-synthesizing enzymes. There was little difference in the growth among the strains used. The effects of Δ*ggt* and Δ*yliAB* on the concentration of extracellular glutathione were compared (Fig. 2). The concentration decreased after reaching the maximum during the early stationary phase when either *ggt* or *yliAB* was normal. That Δ*ggt yliA*^+^ *yliB*^+^ strain accumulates much more glutathione in the medium than the *ggt*^+^ Δ*yliAB* strain indicates that GGT is more effective in reducing the concentration of extracellular glutathione than the YliABCD transporter. On the other hand, the extracellular glutathione of the Δ*ggt* Δ*yliAB* strain gradually increased even during the stationary phase. When the Δ*ggt* Δ*yliAB* strain was complemented with pACYC177 containing the *ybiK*^+^- *yliA*^+^ *yliB*^+^ *yliC*^+^ *yliD*^+^ operon, the extracellular GSH was dramatically decreased.

Transport assay of the YliABCD transporter. Transport assay was performed using \[^{35}S\]glutathione and GGT-deficient derivatives (Fig. 3). The Δ*yliAB* strain transported practically no glutathione, while its *yliA*^+^ *yliB*^+^ derivative obviously transported glutathione. Moreover, Δ*yliAB* strain transformed with pACYC177 containing *ybiK*^+^- *yliA*^+^ *yliB*^+^ *yliC*^+^ *yliD*^+^ complemented the GSH transport phenotype. However, the same strain transformed with pACYC177 containing *ybiK*^+^- *yliA*^+^ *yliB*^+^ *yliC*^+^ did not complement the phenotype (Fig. 3A).

The plasmids containing *ybiK*^+^- *yliA*^+^ *yliB*^+^ *yliC*^+^ *yliD*^+^ but with *yliA*, - *B*, or - *C* deleted were also constructed. The Δ*yliAB* strain was transformed with these plasmids, and a transport assay was performed. Transport of glutathione was not observed when the operon deleted either *yliA*, - *B*, or - *C* (Fig. 3B).

Effect of Δ*yliAB* mutation on the intracellular concentration of glutathione. Glutathione-synthesis-deficient (Δ*gshA*) derivatives of the above strains were grown overnight in the minimal medium supplemented with or without 1 mM reduced glutathione. The cells were then opened by ultrasonication, and the amount of glutathione accumulated inside the cells was measured by HPLC (Fig. 4). All the glutathione found was in reduced form, and no oxidized form was observed. The amount of total glutathione measured with glutathione reductase agreed well with that of reduced glutathione found by HPLC (data not shown). When these four strains were grown in the minimal medium without glutathione, no detectable glutathione was found inside these strains. Although Δ*yliAB* mutation decreased the accumulation of glutathione inside the cells, nonnegligible accumulation of glutathione was observed even in the strain with Δ*yliAB* Δ*ggt* Δ*gshA* (strain SI100).

$\Delta yliAB$ mutation was complemented with pACYC177 containing $ybiK^{+}$-$yliA^{+}yliB^{+}yliC^{+}yliD^{+}$ (strain SI154), but not with pACYC177 containing $ybiK^{+}$-$yliA^{+}yliB^{+}yliC^{+}$ (strain SI153).

Transport of glutathione by the YliABCD transporter depends on ATPase activity. Effect of the ATPase inhibitor verapamil on glutathione transport by the YliABCD transporter was determined. Transport of glutathione by the YliABCD transporter was strongly inhibited in the presence of 10 mM verapamil (Fig. 5). Membrane potential inhibitor, CCCP, had no effect at 100 $\mu$M (data not shown).

Effect of the $\Delta yliAB$ mutation on cell growth. The ability of the YliABCD transporter to utilize glutathione as a sole sulfur source was also investigated. The cysA gene encodes sulfate permease, and a cysA mutant cannot grow with SO$_{4}^{2-}$ in the medium and it is a cysteine auxotroph. The cysA $\Delta ggt$ (sulfate transport and GGT-deficient) strain grew weakly on minimal medium with 0.3 mM glutathione as a sole sulfur source (Fig. 6b, row 4), while almost no growth was observed for its $\Delta yliAB$ derivative on the same plate (Fig. 6b, row 3). The doubling times of the cysA, cysA $\Delta yliAB$, cysA $\Delta ggt$, and cysA $\Delta yliAB \Delta ggt$

strains in minimal medium supplemented with 0.3 mM glutathione at 37°C were 1.7, 2.1, 3.2, and 12 h, respectively.

## DISCUSSION

Our previous study of glutathione metabolism in *E. coli* indicated that catabolism of extracellular glutathione is initiated by the cleavage of its γ-glutamyl linkage by GGT (22, 26). However, the concentration of extracellular glutathione decreased gradually after prolonged incubation even when the *ggt* gene was deleted (Fig. 2, SI49) and the existence of a glutathione importer was suspected. As described in the introduction, we predicted that YliABCD is a glutathione importer. When both ∆ggt and ∆yliAB were deleted, the concentration of the extracellular glutathione did not decrease up to 55 h (Fig. 2, SI37). These results indicate that GGT and the YliABCD transporter are the two determinants that decrease the extracellular glutathione. Since *yliA* and -B are located upstream of *yliC* and -D and the promoter of the operon before *ybiK* (Fig. 1), the complementation test was performed using the plasmid containing whole operon.

A transport assay was performed using \[^{35}S\]glutathione and

Strains SI100 (pACYC177/∆gshA ∆ggt ∆yliAB), SI109 (pACYC177/∆gshA ∆ggt), SI153 (pACYC177::ybiK⁺-yliA⁺ yliB⁺ yliC⁺/∆gshA ∆ggt ∆yliAB), and SI154 (pACYC177::ybiK⁺-yliA⁺ yliB⁺ yliC⁺ yliD⁺/∆gshA ∆ggt ∆yliAB) were grown in minimal medium supplemented with 1 mM reduced glutathione for 12 h. The amount of glutathione found in the cells was expressed as relative to that for strain SI154. Seventy-four nanomoles of glutathione per mg of cells was found in strain SI154.

GGT-deficient derivatives (Fig. 3). This is because GGT cleaves glutathione in the periplasm and cysteinylglycine uptake into the cytoplasm occurs. In fact, a *ggt*⁺ ∆yliAB strain took up a nonnegligible amount of \[^{35}\]S in a transport assay (data not shown). To avoid an overestimation of glutathione uptake by the transporter, GGT-deficient strains were used in this experiment. It was shown that uptake of \[^{35}\]S into the cells depends on the YliABCD transporter in GGT-deficient strains (Fig. 3A). The plasmid with *yliA*⁺ *yliB*⁺ *yliC*⁺ *yliD*⁺ could complement the ∆yliAB mutation, but the plasmid with *yliA*⁺ *yliB*⁺ *yliC*⁺ could not (Fig. 3A). This result strongly suggests that this ∆yliAB mutation has a polar effect on the downstream genes. Therefore, as shown in Fig. 3B, only one of the *yliA*, *yliB*, and *yliC* genes was carefully deleted with the intent of not causing a polar effect on the downstream genes. None of the deletions caused a polar effect, confirmed by the expression of the *lacZ* gene inserted just after the *yliD* gene. Our findings indicate that YliA, -B, -C, and -D are the components of the transporter because the transport activity was abolished if any one of them was deleted (Fig. 3A and B). The *ybiK* gene exists in front of *yliABCD*, and the possibility that they constitute an operon has been suggested (Fig. 1). Since the function of YbiK is not clear and its involvement in glutathione transport or metabolism has been suggested (19), there is a possibility that YbiK processes glutathione and then only a part of its mole-

FIG. 6. Growth of *E. coli* strains on a minimal medium plate supplemented with glutathione as the sole sulfur source. Strains were grown overnight in 5 ml LB medium, washed twice, and suspended with 5 ml of 1× M9 buffer. One μl of cell suspension was plotted on plates and grown overnight at 37°C. Strains 1 (SH1535; *cysA* ∆yliAB::Kanʳ), 2 (SH1527; *cysA*), 3 (SH1525; *cysA* ∆ggt ∆yliAB::Kanʳ), and 4 (SH1504; *cysA* ∆ggt) were grown on minimal medium supplemented with 0.05 mM thiamine without any sulfur source (column a) or with 0.3 mM glutathione (column b) or 0.3 mM cysteine (column c) as a sole sulfur source.

molecule containing \({ }^{35} \mathrm{~S}\) is taken up into the cell. To deny this possibility and to show that the whole glutathione molecule is taken up by the YliABCD transporter, the concentration of glutathione accumulated inside glutathione-synthesis-deficient mutants grown in medium supplemented with glutathione was measured (Fig. 4). These results clearly show that the whole glutathione molecule was transported into the cell by the YliABCD transporter. Parry and Clark suggested the involvement of YbiK in glutathione transport or metabolism (19). Since they used strains with the \(y b i K::\) Kan\(^r\) mutation, which has polar effect on \(y l i A\), \(-B\), \(-C\), and \(-D\), their suggestion of the involvement of YbiK in glutathione transport might have been derived from this polar effect. A study on the role of YbiK is under way, and the results will be reported elsewhere.

Transport of glutathione was inhibited by verapamil, but not by CCCP. This indicates that this transport system depends on ATPase activity and not on membrane potential (Fig. 5).

To determine whether the transport of glutathione by the YliABCD transporter has physiological meaning, the effect of its absence on the growth of *E. coli* by using glutathione as a sole sulfur source was observed. The *cysA* mutant grew on a minimal medium plate supplemented with glutathione as a sole sulfur source (Fig. 6b, row 2). The growth of the *cysA ΔyliAB* strain (Fig. 6b, row 1) was obviously weaker than that of the *cysA* strain. The growth of the *cysA Δggt* strain was severely retarded (Fig. 6b, row 4), and almost no growth was observed for the *cysA Δggt ΔyliAB* strain on the same plate (Fig. 6b, row 3). The growth of cells in column c (minimum medium supplemented with cysteine as a sulfur source (Fig. 6c) was less than that of the *cysA* mutant on minimum medium supplemented with glutathione (Fig. 6b, row 2). We should mention that the addition of this much cysteine inhibits cell growth. The doubling time of these strains in the liquid minimal medium was compared, and the results indicated that both GGT and the YliABCD transporter are important in the growth of *E. coli* with glutathione as a sole sulfur source.

Although no detectable glutathione uptake was observed in the Δggt ΔyliAB strain by transport assay, there was some accumulation of glutathione inside the Δggt ΔyliAB ΔgshA strain grown in minimal medium supplemented with glutathione (Fig. 4, strain SI100). In fact, the *cysA Δggt ΔyliAB* strain could grow in minimal medium supplemented with glutathione as a sole sulfur source (Fig. 6b, row 3); however, its doubling time was extremely long. It is possible that a nonspecific glutathione uptake system besides YliABCD and GGT exists in *E. coli*.

Boos and Lucht (2) reviewed the periplasmic binding-protein-dependent ABC transporters of *E. coli*, and they proposed a consensus sequence of the ATP-binding cassette subunits. The amino acid sequence of YliA conserved many of the consensus residues. YliA has repeats of Walker motif A-linker peptides-Walker motif B (Walker motif A, residues 55 through 63 and 363 through 371; linker peptides, residues 175 through 183 and 470 through 478; Walker motif B, residues 195 through 201 and 490 through 496). According to the MOTIF program (GenomeNet, Japan), YliB has a bacterial extracellular solute-binding protein family 5 signature (residues 76 through 98) and YliC and -D have binding-protein-dependent transport system inner membrane component signatures (residues 197 through 225 and 188 through 216, respectively).

Also, the SignalP program (Technical University of Denmark) predicts that the first 26 amino acids of YliB constitute a signal peptide. The SOSUI program (Department of Biotechnology, Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology) predicted that YliC and -D have six and seven transmembrane helices, respectively. All of these indicate that YliABCD composes an ATP-binding cassette superfamily transporter, YliA and -B being an ATP-binding component and a periplasmic binding protein, respectively, and YliC and -D being plasma membrane components. We propose the name *gsi* for these genes, after glutathione importer. *yliA*, \(-B\), \(-C\), and \(-D\) would be renamed *gsiA*, \(-B\), \(-C\), and \(-D\), respectively.

This is the first report not only of bacterial glutathione transporter but also of a glutathione importer with an ATP-binding cassette among all organisms. The homology search suggests that *Escherichia coli* O157:H7, *Shigella flexneri*, *Salmonella enterica* serovar Typhi, and *Salmonella enterica* serovar Typhimurium have homologues. Our finding of a new glutathione importer with an ATP-binding cassette indicates that there is more diversity in the mechanism of glutathione transport across cell membranes than previously considered.
