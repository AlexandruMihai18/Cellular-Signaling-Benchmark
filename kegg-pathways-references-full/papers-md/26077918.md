# The role of hedgehog signalling in skeletal health and disease

**Benjamin A. Alman**

---

### Abstract
Hedgehog ligands bind to protein patched homologue 1 (PTC), a conserved receptor that activates the GLI family of transcription factors, which are involved in development, disease and skeletal repair processes. During embryonic development, hedgehog signalling helps to pattern the limbs and plays a critical part in regulating chondrocyte differentiation and osteogenesis during the longitudinal growth of long bones. This signalling pathway also regulates mesenchymal cell differentiation during skeletal repair and regeneration. In pathologic and degenerative processes, such as osteoarthritis or cartilaginous tumour formation, hedgehog signalling is dysregulated. Several pharmacologic strategies can modulate hedgehog signalling, and targeting this pathway could lead to the development of novel therapeutic approaches. For example, by precisely regulating the level of activity of the hedgehog signalling pathway, the pace of degeneration in osteoarthritis could be slowed, bone repair could be enhanced, and cartilaginous tumour cell viability could be inhibited. As such, regulation of hedgehog signalling could be manipulated to safeguard skeletal health.

### Introduction
Many cell signalling processes regulate bone development, and advances in understanding these processes have uncovered their roles in the maintenance of normal function, as well as in the development of various pathologies. One such pathway is hedgehog signalling, which regulates cell functions that are critical for normal skeletal development and repair.¹ This signalling cascade is dysregulated in a variety of pathologic processes, and its function during embryonic development is frequently recapitulated in both disease and repair processes occurring later in life. Consequently, mutations that dysregulate hedgehog signalling cause a variety of skeletal as well as nonskeletal syndromes, including the midbrain patterning disorder holoprosencephaly² and neoplastic conditions such as Gorlin syndrome (also called nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome), which is characterized by the presence of multiple basal cell carcinomas.³

Understanding the role of hedgehog signalling in pathology and repair of the skeletal system requires an appreciation of its role in development, during which cells must differentiate, proliferate, move, and die according to precisely controlled temporal and spatial patterns to form a viable organism. In the earliest phases of embryonic development, cells in the inner cell mass become the ectoderm, endoderm, and mesoderm.⁴ Somite formation (which is regulated by a somite clock, such that pulses of gene expression specify the start and end of each segment) patterns the longitudinal body.⁵ Upper and lower limb buds form for the legs and arms, and ectoderm and mesoderm undergo differentiation to form the bones, joints, muscles, and other tissues of the limbs.⁶ Interplay between the ectoderm and mesoderm further regulates limb patterning, and gene expression within the mesoderm controls details of the shape of the skeleton.⁷

The cells that ultimately become osteoblasts, chondrocytes and fibroblasts derive from undifferentiated cells.⁸ Initially, pluripotent embryonic stem cells differentiate into multipotent mesodermal cells.⁹ Differentiated mesenchymal cells can derive from a variety of sources, such as MSCs (defined as either mesenchymal stromal cells or mesenchymal stem cells).¹⁰ Controversy remains about whether or not MSCs truly are stem cells.¹¹ These cells can be found in variety of locations throughout the body, and can differentiate into osteochondral progenitors, which can then become chondrocytes or osteoblasts. However, differentiated cells of this lineage retain a remarkable degree of plasticity, which can even enable them to revert to a precursor state.¹² The induced pluripotent stem cell is an extreme example of such reversion, but lineage-tracing studies showing that a variety of cell types are able to participate in musculoskeletal repair demonstrate that such apparent de-differentiation is not unusual among the bone-repairing cell types.¹³ Indeed, for a critical structure such as the skeleton, it makes sense for the body to have a broad variety of cell types that could be activated to participate in repair.

Longitudinal growth of long bones occurs by endochondral ossification. In this process, new cartilage is formed at one side of the growth plate, and at the other it is progressively replaced by bone (Figure 1). Chondrocytes adjacent to the growth plate are initially in a resting state, but differentiate through proliferative,

Key points
- Hedgehog signalling regulates several cellular processes that are critical in bone development
- Osteoarthritis and cartilaginous neoplasia are associated with activation of the hedgehog signalling pathway
- Several agents that inhibit hedgehog signalling could be used therapeutically to target this pathway
- Inhibition of hedgehog signalling or modulation of the expression of downstream target genes are potential modalities for the treatment of osteoarthritis and cartilaginous tumours
- These two modalities could also be used to increase the effectiveness of strategies to improve bone and joint regeneration

prehypertrophic and hypertrophic stages as the growth plate moves past, after which they undergo apoptosis.⁶,¹⁴ The interzone between long bones eventually becomes the joint. Programmed mesenchymal cell death also specifies the joint location, and cells surrounding this region (which express the bone morphogenetic protein [BMP] family member, GDF-5) become articular chondrocytes and supporting ligaments.⁷ Following degeneration of chondrocytes (or perhaps their transdifferentiation into other cell types),¹⁵ capillaries invade the cartilage matrix, presumably along with osteoblasts that produce endochondral bone.¹⁶

This Review provides an update on the role of hedgehog signalling in development and disease, and outlines progress toward the identification of potential new therapeutic approaches targeting this pathway for skeletal disorders.

### The hedgehog signalling cascade

#### Hedgehog ligands
The three hedgehog ligands are sonic hedgehog (SHH), Indian hedgehog (IHH), and desert hedgehog (DHH).²,³ Hedgehog ligands can function as morphogens, since the level of hedgehog signalling activity can change the way that cells differentiate.² Each of the three ligands activates the hedgehog signalling cascade in a similar manner, but their expression is differentially regulated, both spatially and temporally.³

Post-transcriptional processing of hedgehog ligands involves both proteolytic cleavage and covalent bonding of cholesterol to the carboxyl end of the mature protein.¹ The cholesterol moiety is required for diffusion of the ligand through the extracellular environment, but is not necessary for subsequent signal transduction.¹⁷ Interestingly, treatment with agents that inhibit cholesterol biosynthesis leads to defective responses to hedgehog ligands, independent of altered post-transcriptional processing of the ligand itself, showing that cholesterol also has an important role in intracellular hedgehog signalling.¹⁸ Furthermore, cholesterol deficiency has teratogenic effects that mimic the phenotypes associated with loss-of-function mutations in hedgehog ligand genes or genetic conditions caused by disruption of hedgehog signalling.¹ Extracellular matrix proteins, such as proteoglycans, also alter the ability of hedgehog ligands to diffuse through the extracellular environment.¹⁹ Matrix proteins that influence ligand diffusion outside the cell

can be considered another level of control over the hedgehog signalling pathway, away from the site of the cell secreting the ligand.²⁰

The hedgehog signalling cascade was initially elucidated in *Drosophila melanogaster*.²¹⁻²³ Understanding the similarities and differences in hedgehog signalling pathways between *Drosophila* and mammalian species, therefore, provides useful context.

#### Hedgehog signalling in *Drosophila melanogaster*
In *Drosophila*, hedgehog signalling increases the activity of Cubitus interruptus (Ci).²¹ In the absence of hedgehog ligand binding, Ci is bound to microtubules and undergoes proteolytic cleavage. Cleaved Ci is released from microtubules and enters the nucleus, where it acts as a transcriptional repressor.²² By contrast, full-length Ci is released from microtubules as a result of hedgehog ligand binding to Patched (Ptc) in the context of Smoothened (Smo) activation.²³ Trafficking of full-length Ci into the nucleus requires an intracellular signalling complex consisting of Fused (Fu), Suppressor of fused (Sufu) and the kinesin-like protein, Costal2 (Cos-2).²² Once in the nucleus, full-length Ci is processed to a transcriptional activator form (Figure 2a,b).²³

#### Hedgehog signalling in mammals
The three mammalian hedgehog-regulated GLI transcription factors (GLI1–GLI3)²⁴ are homologues of *Drosophila* Ci (Figure 3). Binding of Hedgehog proteins to the transmembrane receptor patched homologue 1 (PTC) releases the inhibition of smoothened homologue (SMO) and leads to activation of GLI transcription factors, which translocate to the nucleus (Figure 2c,d). However, proteolytic processing similar to that of *Drosophila* Ci has only been demonstrated for GLI3.²⁵ Although GLI2 does contain an enzyme processing site, its other structural features render this protein relatively resistant to proteolytic cleavage.²⁶ GLI2 and GLI3 contain both activator and repressor domains, and can be proteolytically processed to either an activator or repressor form during development of many organ systems.² GLI2 contains two activator domains, however, explaining why it generally acts as an activator rather than a repressor of GLI-mediated transcription (Figure 3).³

In many cell types, GLI3 seems to have a predominant role in hedgehog-ligand-mediated regulation of transcriptional activation. By contrast, data from knockout mice suggest that GLI1 is functionally redundant.²⁷ Nonetheless, a careful analysis of ossification in *Gli1⁻/⁻* mice shows that GLI1 has a role in hedgehog-ligand-mediated specification of the osteoblast lineage. As such, GLI1 probably functions collectively with GLI2 and GLI3.²⁷,²⁸ Downstream targets of hedgehog signalling include several genes that encode hedgehog pathway members, such as *GLI1*, *PTCH1* and *HHIP* (encoding hedgehog-interacting protein), potentially forming a feedback loop.²⁸,²⁹ For example, in mice, HHIP inhibits the ability of hedgehog ligands to activate hedgehog signalling.³⁰,³¹

Although the hedgehog signalling pathway members (as a group) function similarly between *Drosophila* and

Figure 1 | The role of growth plate chondrocytes in long bone development. Primary and secondary ossification centres form in the bone diaphysis and epiphyses, respectively. Longitudinal growth then occurs by endochondral ossification. In this process, new cartilage is formed at one side of the epiphyseal growth plate and is gradually replaced by bone. Growth plate chondrocytes, which are located between the epiphysis and metaphysis of long bones, are initially in a resting state, but differentiate through proliferative, prehypertrophic and hypertrophic stages as the growth plate moves past. This programmed differentiation pathway ends in cell death and the replacement of cartilage by bone. Following chondrocyte death, capillaries invade the cartilage matrix, presumably along with osteoblasts.

mammals to mediate hedgehog signalling and induce transcriptional activation or repression (Figure 2), the function of each protein differs between species. For example, in *Drosophila*, Fused is an essential component of the hedgehog signalling pathway, whereas mammals lacking the homologue of *Drosophila* Fused (which in humans is known as serine/threonine-protein kinase 36) exhibit normal hedgehog signalling.³ Data from *Sufu⁻/⁻* mice show that SUFU is a negative regulator of hedgehog signalling, and is likely to be involved in post-transcriptional modification of GLI proteins as well as nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling.³² Kinesin-like protein KIF7 (the mammalian homologue of Cos-2³³) controls GLI activity either in concert with SUFU, or through regulation of GLI protein degradation.³⁴,³⁵ The balance of expression of genes controlled by GLI1, GLI2 and GLI3 in a given cell can be regulated independently of hedgehog ligand activity, and the role of mediators such as KIF7 changes accordingly depending on the presence of other components in the regulatory complex.³⁴,²⁵ The functions of hedgehog signalling cascade members also differ depending on cell type and the context or niche in which the cell is present.² Thus, information about the function of hedgehog signalling cascade members obtained in one cell type might not necessarily be transferable to other cell types. However, the principal hedgehog signalling components (PTC, SMO and GLI proteins) act in the same way to transduce hedgehog signalling in different mammalian cells.³

Primary cilia are present in almost all cell types, including chondrocytes, and have a critical role in hedgehog signalling (Figure 4).³⁶ Since cilia act as a site for integrating the various proteins that mediate processing of GLI transcription factors, they can aid in either activation or inactivation of GLI transcriptional activity, depending on the status of hedgehog signalling in the specific cell context.³⁷ However, in the skeleton, inhibition of ciliary functions often results in phenotypes similar to those associated with the absence of hedgehog signalling.³⁸–⁴¹ Primary cilia might also act as mechanotransducers, and could be a link between mechanical stimuli and hedgehog signalling activity.⁴²

Hedgehog signalling in chondrocytes

During endochondral bone development, growth plate chondrocyte differentiation is governed by tightly controlled spatial and temporal regulation of hedgehog signalling pathway activation.⁴³ IHH is the main hedgehog ligand in the growth plate,⁴⁴ and is expressed at high levels by prehypertrophic chondrocytes (Figure 5). IHH inhibits chondrocyte differentiation to a hypertrophic state and induces ossification of the surrounding perichondrium.⁴⁵ However, IHH is only required for endochondral (not intramembranous) bone formation.⁴³ IHH can also promote chondrocyte differentiation to a hypertrophic state, through upregulating the expression of *PTHLH*, which encodes parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP).⁴⁶ Expression of PTHrP maintains growth plate chondrocytes in a proliferative state, which inhibits their hypertrophic differentiation.⁴⁷ Maintenance of proliferation also delays the production of IHH, since IHH is produced by prehypertrophic chondrocytes.⁴³,⁴⁶ The mechanism by which growth plate chondrocytes escape this proliferative state have not been completely elucidated, although a PTHrP concentration gradient probably has a critical role (Figure 5).⁴⁸ IHH and PTHrP form a negative feedback loop that both synchronizes and controls the pace of chondrocyte differentiation

Phosphorylation of $C_{i}^{FL}$ by PKA, GSK-3 and CK1 recruits Slimb, resulting in cleavage of $C_{i}^{FL}$ and release of $C_{i}^{Rep}$. $C_{i}^{Rep}$ enters the nucleus and prevents transcription of hedgehog target genes. (Panel b) Binding of hedgehog ligands to Ihog presents these ligands to Ptc, releasing Smo inhibition. Smo translocates to the plasma membrane and is phosphorylated by PKA, GSK-3 and CKI, causing a conformational change that enhances Smo’s interaction with Cos-2. Phosphorylation of Sufu and Cos-2 by Fu releases dephosphorylated $C_{i}^{FL}$, which translocates to the nucleus, is processed to $C_{i}^{Act}$, and activates transcription of Ci target genes.

(Panel d) In the presence of hedgehog ligand binding to PTC, SMO is activated and induces intracellular proteins (including SUFU and KIF7) to process GLI proteins to the transcriptional activator form. SMO, SUFU and KIF7 also facilitate nuclear translocation of GLI proteins. GLI target genes include the hedgehog pathway members GLI1 and PTCH1.

Figure 3 | The three mammalian GLI transcription factors (GLI1–GLI3) are homologues of *Drosophila* Cubitus interruptus (Ci). Although GLI2 contains an enzyme processing site, it is relatively resistant to proteolytic cleavage. Both GLI2 and GLI3 contain activator and repressor domains, but GLI2 has two activator domains, which explains why it typically acts as an activator of GLI-mediated transcription.

deletion of GLI3 rescues the phenotype associated with deletion of IHH, indicating that GLI3 is a negative regulator of IHH-mediated signalling in growth plate chondrocytes. Furthermore, PTHrP also regulates differentiation of growth plate chondrocytes (partly via the activity of GLI3), in a hedgehog-ligand-independent and protein kinase A-dependent manner. However, a detailed phenotypic analysis of complex mutant mouse strains found no role for the hedgehog ligand receptor function of GLI proteins in either chondrocyte or osteoblast differentiation, suggesting that regulation of GLI protein transcriptional activation is most critical in endochondral ossification.

### Hedgehog signalling in skeletal disease

#### Limb patterning abnormalities
In skeletal development, the posterior portion of the limb-bud mesoderm, the zone of polarizing activity, produces factors that specify digit number and identity. Hedgehog ligands are expressed by cells in this mesodermal region and diffuse across the developing limb bud, producing a concentration gradient that acts as a morphogen to specify digit development. Mutations that activate hedgehog signalling cause postaxial polydactyly (the presence of extra digits on the ulnar side). For example, polydactyly can be caused by mutations that inactivate GLI3, which can act as a negative regulator of hedgehog signalling. By contrast, brachydactyly (short fingers or toes) can be caused by missense mutations in *IHH* itself.

#### Cartilaginous tumours
Cartilaginous tumours are the most common types of bone neoplasms. The common benign lesions osteochondromas and enchondromas occur adjacent to the growth plate, where they can cause pain, fractures and skeletal deformity. In addition, these lesions harbour the potential for malignant change to chondrosarcoma.

Osteochondromas are caused by mutations in the *EXT* genes (*EXT1* and *EXT2*) which encode glycosyltransferases that catalyse the formation of heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycan chains, a key step in heparan sulfate proteoglycan biosynthesis. Heparan sulfate proteoglycan consists of a protein core attached to heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycan chains. Heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycan also binds to and affects the diffusion of hedgehog ligands in the extracellular space. Consequently, *EXT* mutations result in an abnormal extracellular distribution of hedgehog ligands. Since the distribution pattern of these ligands controls the orientation of terminally differentiated growth plate chondrocytes, the phenotypic consequence of *EXT* mutations is that bone and cartilage growth occurs at an angle oblique to the normal growth plate direction.

Enchondromas can be caused by mutations that disrupt the differentiation of growth plate chondrocytes. For instance, a mutation in *PTH1R*, which encodes the PTHrP receptor, is present in some patients with multiple enchondromatosis. The mutant receptor constitutively activates hedgehog signalling. Transgenic mice that either express this mutant receptor or overexpress GLI2 in the growth plate develop enchondroma-like lesions.

#### Osteoarthritis
Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative condition of articular cartilage. As the cartilage degrades, the articular chondrocytes undergo changes resulting in a phenotype similar to that of hypertrophic chondrocytes in the growth plate. Proteins expressed during growth plate chondrocyte differentiation are also upregulated in OA. These include IHH, PTHrP and type X collagen (which is expressed almost exclusively by hypertrophic chondrocytes in the growth plate). Terminal differentiation of articular chondrocytes in OA leads to apoptosis, which is also the fate of hypertrophic chondrocytes in the growth plate. Bone changes also occur: osteophytes develop, and the density of subchondral bone (which lies directly beneath articular cartilage) increases. These changes are reminiscent of endochondral bone formation by growth plate chondrocytes, in which cartilage is replaced with bone, suggesting that hedgehog signalling has similar roles in both OA and in the growth plate.

In human OA, expression of hedgehog target genes in cartilage is increased versus that in healthy individuals, and the level of expression correlates positively with the severity of OA. In mice with knee OA induced by destabilization of the medial meniscus, the expression of hedgehog target genes was increased (versus that in controls) in microdissected articular cartilage. In transgenic mice that overexpress *Gli2* or have constitutively active expression of *Smo* in chondrocytes, the resulting aberrant activation of hedgehog signalling in articular chondrocytes induces phenotypic changes that resemble growth plate chondrocyte differentiation.

Figure 4 | In vertebrates, primary cilia can act as an organizing centre for processing GLI proteins. **a** | In the absence of Hedgehog ligand binding, PTC is localized to the cilium and inhibits SMO, which prevents accumulation of SMO in the cilium through an undetermined mechanism. SUFU directly interacts with GLI2 and GLI3, enabling their phosphorylation by PKA, CKI and GSK-3, which promotes their proteolytic processing to GLI2<sub>Rep</sub> and GLI3<sub>Rep</sub>. **b** | Binding of hedgehog ligands to PTC promotes removal of PTC from the cilium. Enzymes (including CKI) phosphorylate SMO, which is activated thereby and accumulates in the primary cilium, resulting in translocation of SUFU–GLI protein complexes to ciliary tips. KIF7 acts through both SUFU-dependent and SUFU-independent mechanisms to control the ciliary localization and dissociation of SUFU–GLI protein complexes, which results in translocation of GLI2<sub>Act</sub> and GLI3<sub>Act</sub> into the nucleus, promoting GLI target gene transcription.

changes, including chondrocyte hypertrophy, are similar to those observed in human OA.<sup>74,75</sup> Furthermore, modulation of hedgehog signalling can attenuate the severity of trauma-induced OA in mice.<sup>74–76</sup> Blocking hedgehog signalling (by either deleting *Smo* in chondrocytes or by treatment with a synthetic hedgehog-blocking agent) results in a substantial improvement in OA disease severity scores in mice.<sup>74</sup> Furthermore, blockade of the hedgehog pathway inhibits osteophyte formation in mice with arthritis induced by serum transfer,<sup>75</sup> and deleting *IHH* in chondrocytes attenuates the severity of surgically induced OA.<sup>76</sup> In addition, depletion of primary cilia in articular chondrocytes results in a shift in the predominant GLI3 activity from repressor to activator, accompanied by symptoms of early OA, in mice.<sup>77</sup> Taken together, the evidence from mouse and human studies indicates increased activation of hedgehog signalling in OA, and that the use of hedgehog signalling inhibitors could attenuate the severity of OA or even prevent its development.

**Heterotopic ossification**

Hedgehog signalling is critical for bone formation in heterotopic ossification, in which bone is inappropriately formed in soft tissues.<sup>77</sup> Progressive osseous heteroplasia is caused by loss of function mutations in *GNAS*, which

encodes the short isoform of G<sub>sα</sub>.<sup>78,79</sup> In animal models of this condition, hedgehog signalling is upregulated in ectopic osteoblasts, and genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of hedgehog signalling reduces the severity of heterotopic ossification.<sup>78,79</sup>

A general role for hedgehog signalling in osteoblasts is suggested by conditions caused by mutations in genes whose protein products are required for ciliary function. Patients with Jeune asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy, which is caused by a mutation in *IFT80* (encoding intraflagellar transport protein 80 homologue, a protein that inhibits cilia function)<sup>80</sup> have decreased hedgehog signalling in bone as well as decreased bone density.<sup>80</sup> *IFT80* deficiency inhibits osteoblast formation<sup>81</sup> and *in vitro* studies show that overexpression of GLI2 can rescue this defect in osteoblast differentiation.<sup>81</sup> Excessive activation of hedgehog signalling in mature osteoblasts can also cause severe reduction of bone mass.<sup>82</sup> Taken together, these observations identify regulation of hedgehog signalling as important in the maintenance of osteoblast differentiation and normal bone density.

Multiple cell types and pathways, including activation of hedgehog signalling, are involved in the various phases

PTHrP maintains growth plate chondrocytes in a proliferative state, which inhibits their hypertrophic differentiation and also delays production of IHH (since IHH is produced by prehypertrophic but not proliferative chondrocytes). PTHrP regulates both hedgehog ligand activity and the processing of GLI3 in a hedgehog-ligand-independent, PKA-dependent, manner. Thus, the PTHrP concentration gradient might control the progression of growth plate chondrocytes from a proliferative to a hypertrophic state by regulating the activity of GLI transcription factors.

### Pharmacologic agents

Several therapeutic agents that target the hedgehog signalling pathway are in clinical development, and one such drug has been successfully used to treat cancers associated with activation of the hedgehog signalling pathway.<sup>87,88</sup>

Ingestion of cyclopamine (an agent derived from the California corn lily, *Veratrum californicum*) during pregnancy results in fetal holoprosencephaly,<sup>87</sup> and subsequent studies revealed that this birth defect was caused by inhibition of hedgehog signalling.<sup>89</sup> Despite the teratogenic effects of this agent, it does have the potential to be used therapeutically to inhibit hedgehog signalling in non-pregnant individuals.<sup>88</sup> Other small molecules have been developed specifically as hedgehog inhibitory agents. One of these, vismodegib, has already been approved for the treatment of basal cell carcinoma.<sup>88</sup> However, the potential adverse effects of this agent limit its use to neoplastic conditions.<sup>90</sup> Indeed, one potential adverse effect of vismodegib in skeletally immature individuals is growth plate arrest.<sup>90</sup>

An alternative approach is to use a repurposed agent to inhibit hedgehog signalling. The antifungal agent trazone inhibits hedgehog signalling pathway activity and cancer growth.<sup>91</sup> Purmorphamine is a purine derivative initially identified as an agent that enhances osteoblast differentiation.<sup>92</sup> This drug was later found to act on SMO to activate hedgehog signalling,<sup>93</sup> and might be useful in procedures for enhancing bone regeneration. Thus, several pharmacologic approaches to modulate hedgehog signalling are already available for use in patients or are on the horizon. Such agents could be used for the treatment of various skeletal conditions in which modulation of the hedgehog signalling pathway might improve outcome.

### Conclusions

Much has been learned about the role of hedgehog signalling in the skeletal system in the past few decades, and we now appreciate that its role in development is recapitulated in various repair and regenerative processes. Several pharmacologic agents that modulate hedgehog signalling activity are already available or in development. Inhibition of this pathway might improve the outcomes of patients affected by OA, heterotopic ossification, or cartilaginous tumours. In tissue repair and regeneration, inhibition of hedgehog signalling could promote the formation of articular chondrocytes from undifferentiated cells, whereas activation of hedgehog signalling might enhance osteogenesis from undifferentiated cells. In this way, maintenance of appropriate levels of hedgehog signalling can be considered a key mechanism for safeguarding skeletal health.
