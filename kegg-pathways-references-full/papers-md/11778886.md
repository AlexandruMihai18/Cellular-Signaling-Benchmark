**Abstract** Spores of *Penicillium digitatum* ATCC 201167 transform geraniol, nerol, citral, and geranic acid into methylheptenone. Spore extracts of *P. digitatum* convert geraniol and nerol NAD‚Å∫-dependently into citral. Spore extract also converts citral NAD‚Å∫-dependently into geranic acid. Furthermore, a novel enzymatic activity, citral lyase, which cofactor-independently converts citral into methylheptenone and acetaldehyde, was detected. These results show that spores of *P. digitatum* convert geraniol via a novel biotransformation pathway. This is the first time a biotransformation pathway in fungal spores has been substantiated by biochemical studies. Geraniol and nerol are converted into citral by citrol dehydrogenase activity. The citral formed is subsequently deacylated by citral lyase activity, forming methylheptenone. Moreover, citral is converted reversibly into geranic acid by citral dehydrogenase activity.

**Introduction**

Spores, although often considered to be metabolically inert, catalyze a large variety of biotransformation reactions. Gehrig and Knight (1958) were the first to report on fungal spores transforming organic compounds. They described the conversion of octanoic acid to 2-heptanone by conidia of *Penicillium roquefortii*, which led to a commercial process for blue-cheese flavor production (Watts and Nelson 1963). Since the discovery of spore biotransformations, the conversion of many more organic compounds has been reported (e.g., steroids, triglycerides, fatty acids, antibiotics, flavonoids, and carbohydrates) (Larroche and Gros 1997). The use of spores instead of mycelium for bioconversion reactions has several advantages. When using spores instead of mycelium, the medium is less viscous, resulting in easier aeration and product recovery (Moskowitz 1979). Moreover, spores are generally easier to store, and the lack of pellet formation results in greater homogeneity of the biocatalyst (Larroche and Gros 1997). In some cases, biotransformation reactions are carried out exclusively by spores; in others, vegetative cells perform the biotransformation less efficiently and for a considerably shorter period of time (Knight 1966). Although spore biotransformations have been reported for some time, to the best of our knowledge no pathway in fungal spores has been substantiated by biochemical studies to date.

The linear monoterpene geraniol occurs in many terpene-containing essential oils. Palmarosa oil contains 70‚Äì85% geraniol, and geranium and rose oils also contain large quantities of geraniol (Bauer and Garbe 1985). Geraniol is a colorless liquid, with a flowery, rose-like odor that is a frequently used terpenoid fragrance material (Bauer and Garbe 1985). The bioconversion and biodegradation of geraniol has been well studied (Seubert and Fass 1964; Rama Devi and Bhattacharyya 1977, 1978; Cantwell et al. 1978; Bock et al. 1988; Brunerie et al. 1988; Demyttenaere and De Pooter 1995, 1996; Hylemon and Harder 1998; King and Dickinson 2000). In many instances, methylheptenone was a major biotransformation product (Rama Devi and Bhattacharyya 1977, 1978; Bock et al. 1988; Brunerie et al. 1988; Demyttenaere and De Pooter 1995, 1996). Methylheptenone has a strong, fatty, green citrus-like odor and a bittersweet taste reminiscent of pear (Burdock 1995). Geraniol is converted to methylheptenone by strains of the fungus *Botrytis cinerea* (Fig. 1A) through the oxidation of the terminal alcohol followed by a carboxylation. *B. cinerea* strain 5882/1 formed up to 83% methylheptenone from geraniol (Bock et al. 1988). Geraniol is also converted to methylheptenone by *Pseudomonas incognita* (Fig. 1B) in a reaction initiated by an epoxidation.

the culture twice with 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), containing 0.1% Tween 80. The spore suspension obtained was concentrated by centrifugation (25,000g; 15 min), dissolved in the same buffer (10 ml), and stored at ‚Äì20¬∞C until used.

Spore bioconversions

Experiments were carried out in 15-ml vials fitted with Teflon Mininert valves (Supelco, Zwijndrecht, The Netherlands). Substrate (1 mM final concentration) was added to a spore suspension in a total volume of 1 ml of 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). After the addition of substrate, the vials were shaken vigorously for 30 s to obtain a homogenous mixture, and then placed in a shaking water bath (250 rpm; 25¬∞C). For every time point, a vial was taken from the water bath and the contents extracted with 1 ml of ethyl acetate. The vials were shaken vigorously to quantitatively extract the terpenes. The ethyl acetate phase was separated from the aqueous phase by centrifuging the mixture in a 2 ml microcentrifuge tube (1 min, 13,000 g). Subsequently, 5 Œºl of the ethyl acetate phase was analyzed by gas chromatography (GC).

Enzyme assays

Spore extract was prepared by thawing aliquots (10 ml) of a frozen spore suspension and adding an equal volume of glass beads (diameter=0.5‚Äì0.75 mm). Subsequently, the spores were broken with a Retsch (Haan, Germany) model MM 2000 bead mill (15 min; 1,580 rpm; 4¬∞C). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation (13,000 g; 10 min; 4¬∞C). The supernatant was used as the spore extract. Dialyzed spore extracts were obtained by dialyzing the spore extract overnight against 100 parts buffer (40¬∞C; molecular cutoff, 5 kDa).

Citrol (geraniol, nerol, or a mixture of both) dehydrogenase activity was determined in a reaction mixture containing spore extract, 10 mM NAD+, 100 mM Na‚ÇÇCO‚ÇÉ/NaHCO‚ÇÉ buffer (pH 10.5), and 1 mM of substrate (nerol or geraniol). The reaction mixture was placed in a shaking water bath (250 rpm; 25¬∞C). At several time points, 0.5-ml samples were taken from the incubation and extracted with 0.5 ml ethyl acetate. Subsequently, 5 Œºl of the ethyl acetate phase was analyzed by GC. Alternatively, citrol dehydrogenase activity was determined spectrophotometrically by monitoring the formation of NADH (Œµ‚ÇÉ‚ÇÑ‚ÇÄ=6.22 mM‚Åª¬π cm‚Åª¬π). Activity was measured at 25¬∞C in an incubation (1 ml) containing 100 Œºl spore extract, 1 mM NAD+, and 100 mM Na‚ÇÇCO‚ÇÉ/NaHCO‚ÇÉ buffer (pH 10.5). The reaction was started by the addition of 1 mM substrate. Specific activities were calculated from the linear part of the reaction and were corrected for endogenous activity.

Citral dehydrogenase activity was determined in a reaction mixture containing spore extract, 100 mM glycine/NaOH buffer (pH 8.5), 2.8 mM citral, and various concentrations of NAD+. The reaction mixture was placed in a shaking water bath (250 rpm; 25¬∞C) and samples (0.5 ml) were taken over time. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 0.5 ml ethyl acetate, and 50 Œºl of H‚ÇÇSO‚ÇÑ was subsequently added to facilitate the extraction of geranic acid. Five microliters of the ethyl acetate phase was analyzed by GC.

Citral lyase was determined using spore extract obtained from spores that were incubated for 3 h with 0.56 mM citral to induce citral lyase activity. Citral (1 mM) was added to 1 ml of spore extract [containing 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.0)] in a 15-ml vial. The vials were placed in a shaking water bath (250 rpm; 25¬∞C). During the biotransformation, headspace samples were taken and analyzed by GC for citral consumption, and methylheptenone and acetaldehyde formation.

Partial purification of citral lyase

Spore extract (30 ml; 30 mg of protein) was applied to a DEAE-Sephacel CL-6B (Pharmacia) column (2.5√ó25 cm) equilibrated

with 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) at 4¬∞C. The column was washed with 63 ml of the same buffer (0.7 ml min‚Åª¬π; collected fraction volume, 7 ml) and the proteins were subsequently eluted with a NaCl gradient in the same buffer (total volume, 602 ml).

### Analytical methods

All terpenes were analyzed by GC using a fused silica cyclodextrin capillary column (type Œ±-DEX 120; length, 30 m; inside diameter, 0.25 mm; film thickness, 0.25 Œºm; Supelco, Zwijndrecht, The Netherlands). GC was performed with a Hewlett Packard 6890 GC, equipped with a flame ionization detector with N‚ÇÇ as the carrier gas. The detector and injector temperatures were 250¬∞C and 200¬∞C, respectively, and the split ratio was 1:50. The samples were analyzed isocratically at an oven temperature of 140¬∞C. Acetaldehyde was determined in the headspace of the samples using the same GC and column. Samples of 100 Œºl were injected and the split ratio was 1:10. The oven temperature was held at 80¬∞C for 2 min and subsequently raised to 140¬∞C (120¬∞C min‚Åª¬π) where it was held for 9 min.

GC-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analyses were carried out on a Hewlett Packard (Wilmington, Del.) 5970 MSD GC equipped with a fused silica capillary column (type HP-5MS; length, 30 m; inside diameter, 0.25 mm; film thickness, 0.25 Œºm). The flow rate of the carrier gas (He) was 1.0 ml min‚Åª¬π. The injector temperature was 220¬∞C, and the oven temperature was increased from 70¬∞C to 175¬∞C at 7¬∞C min‚Åª¬π. The injection volume was 1 Œºl, and the split ratio was 1:50. Electron impact MS data were obtained at 70 eV.

Geraniol, nerol, geranial, neral, geranic acid and methylheptenone were identified by comparing GC retention times and MS spectra with those of authentic samples. All the MS spectra were identical to those in the NIST spectral database (NIST Mass Spectrometry Data Center, S. E. Stein, director). Acetaldehyde was identified by comparing the GC retention time with that of authentic acetaldehyde, and also enzymatically using an acetaldehyde test kit (Boehringer, Mannheim, Germany).

The protein content was determined using a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce, Rockford, Ill.), using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Before analysis, samples and standards were boiled for 15 min with 1 ml of 1 M NaOH per milliliter of sample.

### Chemicals

Geraniol (2-trans-3,7-dimethyl-2,6-octadien-1-ol), nerol (2-cis-3,7-dimethyl-2,6-octadien-1-ol), citral (mixture of cis- and trans-3,7-dimethyl-2,6-octadien-1-al), geranic acid (2-trans-3,7-dimethyl-2,6-octadienoic acid), and methylheptenone (6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one) were purchased from Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland). All other chemicals used were of analytical grade (purity ‚â•99%).

### Results

#### Conversion of geraniol, nerol, citral and geranic acid by spores of *P. digitatum*

The bioconversion of geraniol into methylheptenone by spores of *P. digitatum* is shown in Fig. 2A. After 5 h, geraniol was completely converted and an equimolar amount of methylheptenone was formed. Small amounts of geranic acid accumulated transiently during the conversion of geraniol. Nerol, the cis-trans isomer of geraniol, was transformed into methylheptenone at a similar rate (Fig. 2B). Only after 3 h were maximal geraniol and nerol conversion rates observed.

Commercial citral, a mixture of 60% geranial and 40% neral, was also converted to methylheptenone by

Initially, methylheptenone is formed at half the rate of citral conversion, but when all citral is converted, methylheptenone formation stops for approximately 2 h. After 5 h, the geraniol, nerol, and geranic

iol contains more geranial than neral and, at the end of the conversion, geranial accounts for 60% and neral for 40% of the formed citral (Fig. 3A), which is in accordance with the chemical equilibrium (Wolken et al. 2000). The citral produced from nerol, however, contains more neral than geranial during the first half hour of the conversion. Towards the end of the conversion, the percentage of geranial increases but never reaches the 60% value of the chemical equilibrium (Fig. 3B). This suggests that geraniol is transformed into geranial, while nerol is transformed into neral. After formation of either isomer, isomerization occurs resulting in a mixture of both isomers. This cis-trans isomerization of neral into geranial, and vice versa, is probably catalyzed by proteins and amino acids present in the reaction mixture (Wolken et al. 2000).

Citral dehydrogenase

The transformation of citral into geranic acid by spore extracts of *P. digitatum* is dependent on NAD‚Å∫; using NADP‚Å∫ as the cofactor, no transformation of citral into geranic acid was observed. The citral dehydrogenase activity was highest at an NAD‚Å∫ concentration of 1 mM. The specific activity is much lower than that of citral lyase and citrol dehydrogenase (Table 1). No accumulation of neric acid was observed during the transformation of citral.

Citrol dehydrogenase

NAD‚Å∫-dependent citrol dehydrogenase activity was present in spore extracts of *P. digitatum*, with both geraniol and nerol as the substrates (Fig. 3). There was no activity when using NADP‚Å∫ as a cofactor. Citrol dehydrogenase activity was relatively unstable; storage of spore extracts for 1 h on ice resulted in a 20% loss of enzymatic activity.

Geraniol and nerol were converted into citral (Fig. 3). Geraniol was converted faster than nerol, as was confirmed by the spectrophotometric citrol-dehydrogenase assay (see also Table 1). The citral produced from geran-

Citral lyase

Spore extracts of *P. digitatum* converted citral into methylheptenone even in the absence of added NAD(P)‚Å∫. Equimolar amounts of methylheptenone and acetaldehyde were formed as the products (Fig. 4). Dialyzing the spore extract did not affect the methylheptenone formation rate (data not shown). Boiling the spore extract for 5 min resulted in total loss of activity.

To determine if one or more enzymes are responsible for the conversion of citral into methylheptenone, citral

lyase activity was partially purified using anion-exchange chromatography (Fig. 5). Most of the activity was found in one peak, suggesting that one enzyme is responsible for the citral lyase activity. During the conversion of citral by the partially purified enzyme, geranial was transformed three times faster than neral (not shown). A similar phenomenon was observed during the transformation of citral with spores (Fig. 2C) and spore extract of *P. digitatum* (Fig. 4).

### Discussion

This paper describes the biotransformation pathway of geraniol into methylheptenone in spores of *P. digitatum* (Fig. 6). This is the first time that a geraniol biotransformation pathway has been substantiated by biochemical studies; the pathway is based on enzymatic (Table 1) and substrate degradation and product formation-studies (Fig. 2).

Geraniol is converted into geranial by NAD‚Å∫-dependent citrol dehydrogenase activity. The geranial formed is the subject of abiotic cis-trans isomerization, under the influence of proteins and amino acids (Wolken et al. 2000), resulting in a mixture of 60% geranial and 40% neral. Likewise, nerol is transformed NAD‚Å∫-dependently into neral, which is also isomerized abiotically into a citral mixture. The citral formed is subsequently deacylated by citral lyase activity, forming methylheptenone and acetaldehyde. The geranial formed from geraniol is also partially transformed into geranic acid by NAD‚Å∫-dependent citral dehydrogenase activity. Whole spores also catalyzed the reverse reaction, i.e., the conversion of geranic acid into citral. All substrates tested (geraniol, nerol, geranial, neral, citral, geranic acid, methylheptenone, and acetaldehyde) were degraded by spores of *P. digitatum*. The degradation products were not identified.

nerol, citral and geranic acid) were, in time, transformed into methylheptenone by spores of *P. digitatum*. The biotransformation pathway presented here differs greatly from the previously postulated geraniol to methylheptenone biotransformation pathways (Rama Devi and Bhattacharyya 1977, 1978; Bock et al. 1988; Brunerie et al. 1988; Demyttenaere and De Pooter 1995, 1996). These pathways are either initiated by an epoxidation, or by the oxidation of the alcohol followed by a carboxylation (Fig. 1). All pathways proposed in the literature involve at least four enzymatic steps, whereas the geraniol biotransformation pathway of *P. digitatum* presented here involves only two enzymatic activities. However, the previously described results do not rule out the possibility that these other microorganisms also use the pathway as present in *P. digitatum*. The pathways proposed in the literature are based on bioconversion products found during the conversion of geraniol. These products might very well be the result of side reactions or abiotic conversion of these relatively unstable terpenes.

During the biotransformation of the terpene alcohols geraniol and nerol, we observed a lag phase of several hours (Fig. 2A, B). This lag is most likely caused by lack of NAD+, which is required for the transformation of citrol into citral in the spores. Before the start of the biotransformation of either geraniol or nerol, cofactor regeneration has to be achieved. We do not think that the lag is caused by a lack of citrol dehydrogenase activity, since the enzyme responsible for the reverse reaction, converting citral into citrol, which is probably the same enzyme, is already active in spores at the start of the conversion (Fig. 2C). Furthermore, spore extracts exhibit citrol dehydrogenase activity (Table 1).

The enzymes of *P. digitatum* have a preference for the trans isomer of the terpenes tested; geranial is transformed faster than neral to the corresponding alcohol by whole spores (Fig. 2C), and geranial is also transformed faster than neral into methylheptenone by spore extracts (Fig. 4). Furthermore, spore extracts convert geraniol three times faster than nerol into citral (Fig. 3) and, remarkably, geranic acid is formed by spores (Fig. 2A, C) as well as by spore extracts (Table 1), whereas neric acid is not.

Partial purification of the citral lyase activity suggested that one enzyme converts citral into methylheptenone and acetaldehyde. Citral lyase activity, combining hydratase and aldolase activity, has not been described before. However, several other hydratase-aldolases that catalyze comparable reactions have recently been described, e.g. trans-o-hydroxybenzylidenepyruvate hydratase-aldolase (Eaton 2000), trans-2'-carboxybenzalpyruvate hydratase-aldolase (Iwabuchi and Harayama 1998), and enoyl-CoA hydratase-aldolase (Overhage et al. 1999). The reaction catalyzed by citral lyase most resembles that of 6-hydroxy-2-keto-5-methyl-3,5-heptadienoic acid hydratase-aldolase (Laurie and Lloyd Jones 1999). These enzymes both catalyze cleavage at a double bond resulting in the formation of a ketone and an aldehyde. The likelihood that only one enzyme is responsible for the conversion of citral into methylheptenone and acetaldehyde is supported by the relative ease with which citral is chemically deacetylated (Wolken et al. 2000).

In conclusion, spores of *P. digitatum* ATCC 201167 convert geraniol into methylheptenone via a novel pathway that involves two enzymatic activities: citrol dehydrogenase and citral lyase. This latter enzyme catalyzes a novel enzymatic activity: the deacetylation of an Œ±,Œ≤-unsaturated aldehyde.
