### ABSTRACT

Mitochondria are essential sites for steroid hormone biosynthesis. Mitochondria in the steroidogenic cells of the adrenal, gonad, placenta and brain contain the cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme, P450scc, and its two electron-transfer partners, ferredoxin reductase and ferredoxin. This enzyme system converts cholesterol to pregnenolone and determines net steroidogenic capacity, so that it serves as the chronic regulator of steroidogenesis. Several other steroidogenic enzymes, including 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, 11β-hydroxylase and aldosterone synthase also reside in mitochondria. Similarly, the mitochondria of renal tubular cells contain two key enzymes participating in the activation and degradation of vitamin D. The access of cholesterol to the mitochondria is regulated by the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein, StAR, serving as the acute regulator of steroidogenesis. StAR action requires a complex multi-component molecular machine on the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM). Components of this machine include the 18 kDa translocator protein (TSPO), the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC-1), TSPO-associated protein 7 (PAP7, ACBD3), and protein kinase A regulatory subunit 1α (PKAR1A). The precise fashion in which these proteins interact and move cholesterol from the OMM to P450scc, and the means by which cholesterol is loaded into the OMM, remain unclear. Human deficiency diseases have been described for StAR and for all the mitochondrial steroidogenic enzymes, but not for the electron transfer proteins or for the components of the cholesterol import machine.

### 1. Introduction

Six classes of steroid hormones, all of which are indispensable for mammalian life, are made from cholesterol via complex biosynthetic pathways that are initiated by specialized, tissue-specific enzymes found in mitochondria. These hormones include glucocorticoids (cortisol, corticosterone) and mineralocorticoids (aldosterone) produced in the adrenal cortex; estrogens (estradiol), progestins (progesterone) and androgens (testosterone, dihydrotestosterone) produced in the gonads; and calciferols (1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D [1,25OH₂D]) produced in the kidney. The biosynthesis of the steroid hormones (Miller and Auchus, 2011) and of 1,25OH₂D (a sterol) (Feldman et al., 2013) from cholesterol have been reviewed recently. There are two specialized aspects to the mitochondria of these steroidogenic tissues—the specialized mechanisms by which cholesterol is delivered to the mitochondria and the specialized intra-mitochondrial enzymes that participate in the synthesis of hormonal steroids.

### 2. Delivery of cholesterol to mitochondria

#### 2.1. Sources of cholesterol

The intracellular transport and distribution of cholesterol prior to its delivery to the mitochondria has been reviewed recently (Miller and Bose, 2011). Cholesterol may be produced *de novo* from acetate via a complex pathway primarily found in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Porter and Herman, 2011), but most steroidogenic

cholesterol is derived from circulating lipoproteins. High density
lipoproteins (HDLs) may be taken up via scavenger receptor B1
(SR-B1) and low-density lipoproteins (LDLs) are taken up by
receptor-mediated endocytosis via LDL receptors. LDL can suppress
the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol synthesis, 3-hydroxy-
3-methylglutaryl co-enzyme A (HMGCoA) reductase. Rodents
preferentialy use the HDL/SR-B1 pathway to obtain steroidogenic
cholesterol, but the principal human source is receptor-mediated
endocytosis of LDL. Nevertheless, patients with congenital abeta-
lipoproteinemia have low LDL cholesterol but have normal basal
cortisol concentrations, and only mildly impaired cortisol re-
sponses to adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) (Illingworth
et al., 1982), and those treated with high doses of statins have no
impairment of cortisol secretion (Dobs et al., 2000). Thus endoge-
nously produced cholesterol is sufficient in most situations, and
the HDL/SR-B1 system plays a relatively minor role in human ste-
roidogenesis. The regulation of cholesterol uptake, intracellular
transport, and utilization is coordinated by a family of basic
helix-loop-helix transcription factors called the sterol regulatory
element binding proteins (SREBPs). The cell biology of intracellular
cholesterol trafficking is summarized in Fig. 1.

(SOAT1). Similarly, HDL cholesteryl esters that enter the cell via
SR-B1 are acted on by hormone-sensitive neutral lipase (HSL), fol-
lowing which the free cholesterol may also be used or re-esterified
for storage. ACTH and luteinizing hormone (LH) respectively in-
crease intracellular levels of cAMP in the adrenal and gonad, stim-
ulating HSL and inhibiting ACAT, thus increasing the availability of
free cholesterol for steroid hormone synthesis. ACTH, LH and other
factors that increase cAMP stimulate the activity of HMGCoA
reductase and the uptake of LDL cholesterol. When intracellular
cholesterol concentrations are high, the genes for the LDL receptor,
HMGCoA reductase and LAL are repressed while ACAT is induced,
thereby decreasing cholesterol uptake, synthesis and de-esterifica-
tion. Conversely, when intracellular cholesterol concentrations are
low, this process is reversed.

Mutations in the LIPA gene encoding LAL cause Wolman disease,
characterized by visceral accumulation of cholesteryl esters and
triglycerides, with secondary adrenal insufficiency; cholesterol
ester storage disease is a milder, adult variant (Lohse et al.,
1999). Affected infants quickly develop hepatosplenomegaly, mal-
absorptive malnutrition and developmental delay; the diagnosis
may be suggested by calcification that outlines the adrenal glands,
and is established by finding deficient lysosomal acid lipase activ-
ity in leukocytes, fibroblasts or prenatal amniocytes. Bone marrow
transplantation may ameliorate the disease, but the mechanism is
unclear. In contrast to LAL, no known human disease is associated
with HSL deficiency.

2.2. Lipases and the processing of cholesterol esters

After circulating LDL is internalized by receptor-mediated endo-
cytosis, the resulting endocytic vesicles fuse with lysosomes,
where the LDL proteins are degraded by proteolysis, liberating
the cholesteryl esters, which are then hydrolyzed to ‘free’ choles-
terol by lysosomal acid lipase (LAL). However, cholesterol is never
truly free, as its solubility is only about 20 μmol per liter, so that
the term ‘free cholesterol’ refers to cholesterol that is bound to
proteins or membranes, but lacks a covalently linked group. Free
cholesterol may be used by the cell or stored in lipid droplets
following re-esterification by acyl-coenzyme-A-cholesterol-acyl-
transferase (ACAT) also known as sterol-O-acetyltransferase

2.3. Endosomal processing of cholesterol

The entry and exit of cholesterol from lipid droplets involves
the NPC proteins, so named because their mutation causes
Niemann Pick type C (NPC) disease, which is characterized by
endosomal accumulation of LDL-cholesterol and glyco-
sphingolipids. Patients are normal in infancy but develop ataxia,
dementia, loss of speech and spasticity at 2–4 years, and usually

Fig. 1. Intracellular cholesterol trafficking. Human steroidogenic cells take up circulating low-density lipoproteins (LDLs) by receptor-mediated endocytosis, directing the
cholesterol to endosomes; rodent cells utilize cholesterol from high-density lipoproteins (HDLs) via scavenger receptor B1 (SRB1). Cholesterol may also be synthesized from
acetate in the ER. Cholesteryl esters are cleaved by lysosomal acid lipase (LAL); free cholesterol is then bound by NPC1, transferred to NPC2, and exported. The MLN64/
MENTHO system resides in the same endosomes as the NPC system, but its role in cholesterol trafficking remains uncertain. Cholesterol may be re-esterified by acyl-CoA:
cholesterol transferase (ACAT) and stored in lipid droplets as cholesteryl esters. Free cholesterol may be produced by hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL). Cholesterol can reach
the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) by non-vesicular means by utilizing START-domain proteins or other cholesterol transport proteins. Movement of cholesterol
from the OMM to the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) requires a multi-protein complex on the OMM. In the adrenals and gonads, the steroidogenic acute regulatory
protein, StAR, is responsible for the rapid movement of cholesterol from the OMM to the IMM, where it can be converted to pregnenolone by P450scc. (© WL Miller).

die during their second decade (Vanier and Millat, 2003). Cholesterol and other lipids accumulate in Purkinje cells and other neurons, and there is robust glial infiltration. The diagnosis is typically made by finding characteristic foamy Niemann-Pick cells and ‘sea-blue’ histiocytes in the bone marrow. The NPC1 or NPC2 proteins participate in endosomal/lysosomal cholesterol transport. NPC1 is a 1278 AA glycoprotein containing 13 transmembrane domains that span the endo-lysosomal membrane (Kwon et al., 2009), and NPC2 is a soluble 151 AA glycoprotein found in the lysosomal lumen (Xu et al., 2007). NPC2 binds cholesteryl esters with the cholesterol side-chain buried is in a hydrophobic pocket and the polar 3βOH group exposed, allowing LAL to cleave cholesteryl esters while they are bound to NPC2. The free cholesterol is then transferred to the N-terminal domain of NPC1 in the lysosomal lumen, which binds cholesterol the 3βOH group buried in the protein and the side chain partially exposed. Thus, the NPC2 and NPC1 proteins act together to insert cholesterol into the lysosomal membrane with the hydrophobic side-chain going in first.

Two proteins named MLN64 (metastatic lymph node clone 64) and MENTHO (MLN64N-terminal domain homologue) may also participate in endosomal cholesterol trafficking. MLN64 is a cholesterol-binding protein that co-localizes with NPC1 in late endosomes (Zhang et al., 2002; Alpy and Tomasetto, 2006). The N-terminal ‘MENTAL’ domain (for MLN64N-TerminAL) is structurally related to the late-endosomal protein, MENTHO (Alpy et al., 2002), contains 4 transmembrane domains, and targets MLN64 to late endosomal membranes. The C-terminal domain of MLN64 is called the START (StAR-related lipid transfer) domain because it is similar to the lipid-biding domain of the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) (Alpy et al., 2001; Clark, 2012) (see Section 3). The MENTAL domains of MENTHO and MLN64 can interact to form homo- and heterodimers and to bind cholesterol, suggesting a role in endosomal cholesterol transport. MLN64 lacking the MENTAL domain (N-234 MLN64) has 50–60% of StAR-like activity to stimulate mitochondrial uptake of cholesterol (Bose et al., 2000). The START domain of MLN64 may interact with cytoplasmic HSP60 to stimulate steroidogenesis in placental mitochondria (Olvera-Sanchez et al., 2011). The function of MLN64 remains unclear: knockout of the START domain of MLN64 yielded viable, neurologically intact, fertile mice with normal plasma and hepatic lipids (Kishida et al., 2004), and no human disorders of MLN64 or MENTHO have been described. Accumulation of cholesterol in NPC1-deficient cells increased MLN64-mediated cholesterol transport to mitochondria and accumulation of cholesterol in the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM), suggesting that cholesterol transport from endosomes to mitochondria may involve MLN64 (Charman et al., 2010).

### 2.4. Non-vesicular intracytoplasmic cholesterol transport

Intracellular cholesterol transport may be ‘vesicular’ (mediated by membrane fusion) or ‘non-vesicular’ (bound to proteins). Because membranes participating in vesicular transport are fluid, the lipid compositions of the mitochondrial membranes may vary. Protein-protein interactions between lipid droplets, mitochondria, and other organelles may facilitate vesicular cholesterol transport. Both vesicular and non-vesicular cholesterol transport occur in steroidogenic cells, but non-vesicular transport involving high-affinity cholesterol-binding START-domain proteins appears to be the principal means of cholesterol transport from lipid droplets to mitochondria (Miller and Bose, 2011). START-domain proteins are found in fungi, plants and animals; the mammalian START-domain proteins are termed StarD1-15 (Clark, 2012). The START proteins most closely related to StAR (StarD4, D5 and D6), bind cholesterol and are induced by SREBP. StarD4, D5, and D6 lack N-terminal signal sequences, suggesting they are cytosolic

proteins. StarD1 (StAR), StarD3 (MLN64), StarD4 and StarD5 bind cholesterol with high affinity and specificity, facilitate cholesterol transport through an aqueous environment, and appear to play important roles in cellular cholesterol homeostasis (Rodriguez-Agudo et al., 2008). StAR and StarD6 stimulate the movement of cholesterol from the OMM to the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM), but StarD4 and StarD5 do not (Bose et al., 2008a). StarD4 and/or StarD5 may bring cholesterol to the OMM; however, StarD4 knockout mice have no changes in steroidogenesis and minimal changes in weight and serum lipids, hence an essential function of StarD4 is not established (Riegelhaupt et al., 2010). While all the mechanisms that move cholesterol to the mitochondria have not been determined, the current view is that the principal mechanism is by non-vesicular transport via StarD proteins, but that StAR itself plays a minor role in this step. The OMM of adrenal mitochondria contains abundant cholesterol, while the IMM contains little cholesterol. Whether or not all OMM cholesterol is potentially available for steroidogenesis has been unclear. Early studies identified a distinct pool of “steroidogenic” OMM cholesterol that was distinct from the structural membrane cholesterol and could be mobilized by cAMP (Stevens et al., 1992). Movement of cholesterol from the OMM to the IMM is central to the initiation of steroidogenesis, because the cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme (P450scc) system is localized to the IMM. Whether or nor there are two kinetically distinct pools of cholesterol in the OMM, and how cholesterol is transferred to the IMM remain under investigation.

### 3. Entry of cholesterol into steroidogenic mitochondria: action of the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein, StAR

#### 3.1. Acute and chronic regulation of steroidogenesis

Unlike cells that produce polypeptide hormones, which store large amounts of mature hormone available for rapid release, cells that produce steroid hormones store very little steroid, so that steroid secretion requires induction of steroid synthesis. There are several distinct mechanisms regulating steroidogenesis. In the adrenal, ACTH promotes steroidogenesis at three levels. First, over the course of months ACTH promotes adrenal growth via fibroblast growth factor, epidermal growth factor, insulin-like growth factor 2, and possibly other factors. Second, over the course of days, ACTH, acting via cAMP in the adrenal zona fasciculata and angiotensin II acting via calcium/calmodulin in the zona reticularis promote transcription of genes for steroidogenic enzymes, especially the gene encoding P450scc(CYP11A1) thus increasing the amounts of steroidogenic enzymes. Third, acting on a 15–60 min time scale, ACTH rapidly stimulates both the activation of pre-existing StAR and the synthesis of new StAR. ACTH/cAMP stimulates phosphorylation of StAR at Ser195 almost immediately, doubling its activity (Arakane et al., 1997), and induces StAR transcription within minutes (Jo et al., 2005; Manna et al., 2009). StAR then interacts with a complex macromolecular machine on the OMM to increase the flow of cholesterol from the OMM to the IMM where it becomes the substrate for P450scc. The first two modes of steroid regulation comprise the chronic steroidogenic response and the action of StAR comprises the acute steroidogenic response.

#### 3.2. The steroidogenic acute regulatory protein, StAR

StAR was discovered in the search for the factor that triggers the acute steroidogenic response. Autoradiographic spots were noted on 2-dimentional gels that appeared within 30 min of stimulating steroidogenic tissues (Pon and Orme-Johnson, 1986; Pon et al., 1986; Epstein and Orme-Johnson, 1991; Stocco and Sodeman

1991); the cDNA was then cloned (Clark et al., 1994; Sugawara et al., 1995), and the factor was named the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein, StAR (reviewed in Stocco and Clark, 1996). StAR is a 37-kDa protein with an N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence that is cleaved off during mitochondrial import to yield 30-kDa intramitochondrial StAR. Co-expression of StAR and P450scc in nonsteroidogenic cells rapidly increases conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone, suggesting that StAR triggers the acute steroidogenic response (Stocco and Clark, 1996). The indispensable role of StAR was demonstrated by finding that StAR mutations cause congenital lipoid adrenal hyperplasia, in which very little steroid is made (Lin et al., 1995; Bose et al., 1996). However, some steroidogenesis can take place in the absence of StAR. In vivo, the human placenta synthesizes steroids via mitochondrial P450scc but does not express StAR (Bose et al., 2000). In vitro, cells expressing the P450scc enzyme system but not StAR can convert cholesterol to pregnenolone (Harikrishna et al., 1993; Black et al., 1994) at ~14% of the maximal StAR-induced rate (Lin et al., 1995; Bose et al., 1996). StAR-independent steroidogenesis might occur without a triggering protein, possibly using intracellular hydroxysterols that bypass StAR action; alternatively, another protein, such as the 30 kDa proteolytic cleavage product of MLN64, may exert StAR-like activity to promote mitochondrial cholesterol import, but the precise mechanism(s) are unclear.

### 3.3. StAR acts on the outer mitochondrial membrane

The presence of a typical mitochondrial ‘leader’ sequence initially suggested that 37 kDa cytoplasmic StAR is a ‘precursor,’ and that the 30 kDa intramitochondrial protein is the ‘mature form,’ but these terms do not describe the biology of StAR (Miller, 2007). The crystallographic structure of the START domain of MLN64 (N-216 MLN64), which shares 37% amino acid sequence identity with StAR, suggested that 30-kDa StAR acts in the intramembranous space (IMS) to shuttle cholesterol from the OMM to the IMM (Tsuji-shita and Hurley, 2000). This structure shows a globular protein with an α/β helix-grip fold and an elongated hydrophobic pocket approximately 26 Å deep and 10 Å across at its widest diameter. The structure of StAR was then modeled based on MLN64 (Mathieu et al., 2002; Yaworsky et al., 2005) and these models have been confirmed by crystallography at 3.4 Å resolution (Thorsell et al., 2011). The sterol-binding pocket of StAR accommodates a single molecule of cholesterol with its 3β-OH group coordinated by the two polar residues. These structures and the structure of StarD4 (Romanowski et al., 2002) are characterized by long N- and C-terminal α-helices, two short α-helices, and 9 antiparallel β sheets that form a helix-grip fold. However, deletion of StAR’s mitochondrial leader has no effect on its activity (Arakane et al., 1996), and both the 37 kDa and 30 kDa forms of StAR are equally active in vivo and in vitro (Bose et al., 2002). When StAR was fused to the cytoplasmic C-terminus of the OMM protein Tom-20, thus immobilizing StAR an OMM, it was constitutively active, but when StAR was immobilized in the IMS or on the matrix side of the IMM, it was wholly inactive. Furthermore, manipulating the speed of StAR’s mitochondrial entry by manipulating the leader sequence showed that faster import decreased activity whereas slower import increased activity (Bose et al., 2002). Thus, StAR acts exclusively on the OMM and its activity is proportional to how long it remains on the OMM. Thus it is the OMM localization of StAR, and not its cleavage from the 37 kDa form to the 30 kDa form, that determines its activity.

#### 3.4. StAR’s action requires conformational changes and serine phosphorylation

The mechanism by which StAR triggers cholesterol flux from the OMM to the IMM involves a multi-protein complex on the

OMM (see below) and requires pH-induced conformational changes in StAR that are needed for StAR to accept and discharge cholesterol (Bose et al., 1999; Baker et al., 2005). StAR can transfer cholesterol between synthetic, protein-free membranes in vitro, but with non-physiologic stoichiometry (Tuckey et al., 2002), and a biologically inactive StAR mutant (R182L) can also transfer cholesterol to membranes in vitro (Baker et al., 2007). Thus cholesterol-binding is necessary but not sufficient for StAR activity. Proteolysis of StAR bound to synthetic membranes that model OMM lipid composition showed that only the exterior surface of the C-terminal α-helix and small segments of the adjacent Ω-loops were protected, suggesting that only these domains interact with the OMM (Yaworsky et al., 2005). Molecular dynamics studies show that cholesterol is blocked from reaching the cholesterol-binding pocket of StAR by a set of hydrogen bonds that are disrupted when the surface residues of StAR are protonated (as happens when StAR interacts with charged phospholipids on the OMM), thus eliciting a conformational change that permits cholesterol access (Bose et al., 1999; Baker et al., 2005). When the movement of the C-helix is prohibited by mutagenesis that creates disulfide bonds, activity is lost, but reducing these bonds restores activity, showing that the immobilized C-helix, and not the mutagenesis, is responsible for the lost activity (Baker et al., 2005). Thus the activity of StAR on the OMM requires an acid-induced disruption of hydrogen bonds and a consequent conformational change in StAR to permit it to bind and release cholesterol.

The phosphorylation of StAR on Ser 195 approximately doubles StAR’s activity (Arakane et al., 1997). It appears that the protein kinase A (PKA) anchor protein AKAP121 recruits the type II PKA regulatory subunit α (PKAR2A) to the OMM, which phosphorylates StAR, whereas the type I kinase drives StAR transcription (Dyson et al., 2009). A physical interaction between the 37 kDa cytoplasmic form of StAR and HSL has also been reported (Shen et al., 2003). StAR is recycled, with each molecule moving hundreds of molecules of cholesterol into the mitochondria before StAR is imported into the mitochondria and is inactivated (Artemenko et al., 2001).

### 4. StAR interacts with an OMM protein complex

#### 4.1. The peripheral benzodiazepine receptor or mitochondrial transporter protein

StAR acts on the OMM via a complex that consists of several proteins, most of which are now identified, even though it remains unclear what role each plays in the mitochondrial import of cholesterol (Bose et al., 2008b; Rone et al., 2012; Papadopoulos and Miller, 2012). The first of these proteins to be identified is the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) (Lacapere and Papadopoulos, 2003), now also called the mitochondrial transporter protein (TSPO) (Papadopoulos et al., 2006). It was initially proposed that PBR/TSPO was the ‘acute trigger’ of steroidogenesis, but it is now clear that StAR plays that role, and that PBR/TSPO is part of the molecular machine on the OMM through which StAR acts (Papadopoulos and Miller, 2012). PBR/TSPO is a ubiquitously expressed 18 kDa protein that comprises up to 2% of OMM protein. PBR/TSPO ligands can stimulate cholesterol movement from the OMM to the IMM and stimulate steroidogenesis (Lacapere and Papadopoulos, 2003). Knockdown of the gene encoding PBR/TSPO in Leydig cells disrupts cholesterol transport and steroidogenesis, and transfection of the PBR/TSPO-disrupted cells with the wild-type cDNA rescues steroidogenesis (Papadopoulos et al., 1997). However, knocking out the PBR/TSPO gene in mice caused early embryonic lethality, indicating its indispensable role during development (Lacapere and Papadopoulos, 2003).

As is typical of proteins associated with the OMM, PBR/TSPO lacks a canonical mitochondrial targeting sequence; instead, the C-terminal half targets PBR/TSPO to the OMM (Rone et al., 2009). PBR/TSPO appears to have five transmembrane α-helices spanning the OMM (Joseph-Liauzun et al., 1998; Korkhov et al., 2010), suggesting that TSPO functions as a cholesterol channel, consistent with data indicating that PBR/TSPO acts downstream from StAR (Hauet et al., 2005; Liu et al., 2006). PBR/TSPO and has a cytoplasmic domain containing a “cholesterol recognition amino acid consensus” (CRAC) domain (Li et al., 2001). PBR/TSPO binds cholesterol at the CRAC domain, suggesting that this domain participates in transferring cholesterol from the OMM to the IMM (Jamin et al., 2005). Mutagenesis of the CRAC domain interferes with cholesterol binding and transfer of cholesterol to the IMM, and blocking the binding of cholesterol to the CRAC domain prevents steroidogenesis (Midzak et al., 2011). Targeted deletion of the TSPO gene in an immortalized Leydig cell line blocked cholesterol transport into the mitochondria and reduced steroid production; reintroduction of TSPO into the deficient cell line restored steroidogenic capacity (Li et al., 2001).

### 4.2. Other components of the OMM protein complex

PBR/TSPO is a component of a 140–200 kDa multi-protein complex consisting of PBR/TSPO, the 34-kDa voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC1), the 30-kDa adenine nucleotide transporter (ANT), the 10-kDa diazepam-binding inhibitor (acyl-CoA-binding domain 1, ACBD1), the TSPO-associated protein-1 (PRAX-1), and the PKA regulatory subunit RIα-associated protein 7 (PAP7) (Rone et al., 2012). PAP7, also known as acyl-CoA binding domain-containing protein 3 (ACBD3), binds both TSPO and the regulatory subunit RIα of PKA (Fan et al., 2010). PBR/TSPO interacts with VDAC on the OMM, helping to anchor the multi-protein complex to the OMM and assisting with the binding and import of StAR (Liu et al., 2006); VDAC1 also interacts with ANT on the IMM (McEinery et al., 1992). While a functional interaction between StAR and PBR/TSPO is clear (Hauet et al., 2005), a physical interaction has not been demonstrated; protein cross-linking experiments indicate that StAR directly interacts with VDAC1 and with phosphate carrier protein (PCP), but not with PBR/TSPO (Bose et al., 2008b). VDAC1 also appears to interact with PBR/TSPO (Liu et al., 2006; Rone et al., 2009). It is not clear how VDAC-1 participates in cholesterol import, as VDAC-1 has a ring-like structure with a hydrophilic interior that is well-suited to anion transport, but is unlikely to form a channel for hydrophobic cholesterol (Bayrhuber et al., 2008; Hiller et al., 2008). VDAC is found at contact sites between the OMM and the IMM (Mannella et al., 1992) where it may complex with hexokinase, ANT, creatine kinase and proteins of the Bcl-2 family (Brdiczka et al., 2006).

### 5. Mutations in StAR – congenital lipoid adrenal hyperplasia (Lipoid CAH)

Lipoid CAH is characterized by absent or very low serum concentrations of all steroids, high basal ACTH and plasma renin activity, and grossly enlarged adrenals filled with cholesterol and cholesteryl esters (Miller, 1997). Lipoid CAH was initially thought to be an enzymatic disorder and was mis-termed ‘20,22-desmolase deficiency’, but the CYP11A1 gene for P450scc is not mutated in these patients (Lin et al., 1991), and the placenta (a fetal tissue) continues to produce progesterone in lipoid CAH (Saenger et al., 1995), indicating a lesion upstream from P450scc, such as in a factor involved in mitochondrial cholesterol transport (Lin et al., 1991). Mutations in the gene for PBR/TSPO were sought and excluded (Lin et al., 1993), but mutations were found in StAR (Lin et al., 1995; Bose et al., 1996), so that lipoid CAH represents the StAR knockout experiment of nature (Miller, 1997).

The pathophysiology of lipoid CAH is explained by the two-hit model (Bose et al., 1996). The first hit is lost StAR activity, causing diminished steroidogenesis and a compensatory rise in ACTH and gonadotropins. These increased tropic hormones stimulate intracellular cAMP production, increasing LDL receptors, LDL cholesterol uptake, and de novo synthesis of cholesterol. Intracellular cholesterol then accumulates, causing the second hit: the loss of remaining steroidogenic capacity due to mitochondrial damage from the accumulated cholesterol, cholesteryl esters, and their auto-oxidation products (Bose et al., 1996) (Fig. 2). The absence of StAR activity affects fetal testicular Leydig cells early in gestation, preventing synthesis of the testosterone needed for the development of male external genitalia, hence affected 46,XY fetuses are born with female external genitalia. However, the testicular Sertoli cells function normally and produce anti-Müllerian hormone, so the phenotypically female 46,XY fetus lacks female internal reproductive organs. The fetal adrenal typically produces very little aldosterone, so that the zona glomerulosa is not tropically stimulated and hence usually remains undamaged until after birth. Hence, newborns with lipoid CAH may not have a salt-wasting crisis until several months of life, when chronic stimulation then leads to cellular damage.

The two-hit model has been confirmed in clinical studies, explaining why affected 46,XX patients feminize at the age of puberty (Bose et al., 1997; Fujieda et al., 1997), and also in knockout mice (Hasegawa et al., 2000). The fetal ovary makes essentially no steroids and remains unstimulated and hence undamaged until adolescence, when it is stimulated by pubertal gonadotropins, yielding small amounts of estrogen produced by StAR-independent steroidogenesis. However, this low level of steroidogenesis is insufficient to generate progesterone in response to the mid-cycle LH surge; continued stimulation results in cholesterol accumulation and cellular damage, impairing the later biosynthesis of progesterone, resulting in anovulatory cycles. Gonadotropin stimulation does not promote global ovarian steroidogenesis, but only recruits individual follicles, hence most follicles remain undamaged and available for future cycles. A new follicle is recruited with each successive cycle, producing estradiol by StAR-independent steroidogenesis, resulting in breast development, so that the patient experiences general feminization, monthly estrogen withdrawal and cyclic vaginal bleeding.

Lipoid CAH is relatively common in Japan and Korea, where the carrier frequency is approximately one in 300, and most affected individuals carry the mutation Q258X (Bose et al., 1996; Nakae et al., 1997; Kim et al., 2011). Mutations retaining about 10–25% of normal StAR activity, especially R188C, cause a milder disease called “non-classic lipoid CAH”, characterized by adrenal insufficiency several years after infancy, nearly normal masculinization of 46,XY individuals, and minimally affected mineralocorticoid secretion (Baker et al., 2006).

### 6. The cholesterol side chain cleavage enzyme – the prototypical mitochondrial P450

#### 6.1. Cytochrome P450 enzymes

Once cholesterol reaches the IMM, it may be converted to pregnenolone to initiate steroidogenesis. Most steroidogenic enzymes are cytochrome P450 enzymes, all of which have approximately 500 residues, contain a single heme group and absorb light at 450 nm when reduced with carbon monoxide. The human genome contains 57 CYP genes encoding cytochrome P450 enzymes; the corresponding proteins may be given the same name without

**Fig. 2.** Two-hit model of lipoid CAH. (A) In normal adrenal cells, cholesterol is primarily derived from low-density lipoproteins, and the rate-limiting step in steroidogenesis is movement of cholesterol from the OMM to the IMM. (B) Early in lipoid CAH, StAR-independent steroidogenesis moves small amounts of cholesterol into mitochondria, yielding sub-normal steroidogenesis; ACTH secretion increases, stimulating further accumulation of cholesteryl esters in lipid droplets. (C) As lipids accumulate, they damage the cell through physical engorgement and by the action of cholesterol auto-oxidation products; steroidogenic capacity is destroyed, but tropic stimulation continues. Ovarian follicular cells remain unstimulated and undamaged until puberty, when small amounts of estradiol are produced, as in B, causing phenotypic feminization, with infertility and hypergonadotropic hypogonadism.

the use of italics (thus CYP11A1 encodes the cholesterol side chain cleavage enzyme, P450scc; which may also be termed CYP11A1, without italics). Seven human cytochrome P450 enzymes are targeted to the mitochondria, the other 50 are targeted to the ER; the roles of the human P450 enzymes have been reviewed recently (Nebert et al., 2013). P450 enzymes activate molecular oxygen via their heme iron using electrons donated by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH). Mitochondrial (type 1) P450 enzymes receive electrons from NADPH via an electron transfer chain consisting of a flavoprotein termed ferredoxin reductase and a small iron-sulfur protein termed ferredoxin (Miller, 2005) (Fig. 3). The type 2 P450 enzymes in the ER receive electrons via a single 2-flavin protein termed P450 oxidoreductase (Miller, 2005). All P450 enzymes can catalyze multiple chemical reactions, often with very different substrates.

**6.2. Steps in steroidogenesis**

Six P450 enzymes participate in steroidogenesis, and at least three more participate in the processing of vitamin D; five of these are found in mitochondria. Steroidogenesis is initiated by mitochondrial P450scc. P450scc cleaves the 20,22 bond of insoluble cholesterol to produce soluble pregnenolone, and is the hormonally regulated, rate-limiting step in steroidogenesis. It is the expression of the CYP11A1 gene that renders a cell ‘steroidogenic’. Pregnenolone may then be converted to progesterone by 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3βHSD), which may be found both in the mitochondria and in the ER (see Section 9). Alternatively,

**Fig. 3.** Organization of mitochondrial P450 enzyme systems. NADPH first donates electrons to the FAD moiety of ferredoxin reductase (FeRed); ferredoxin reductase then interacts with ferredoxin (Fedx) by charge-charge attraction, permitting electron transfer of the Fedx to the Fe₂S₂ center (ball and stick diagram). Ferredoxin then dissociates from ferredoxin reductase and diffuses through the mitochondrial matrix. The same surface of ferredoxin that received the electrons from ferredoxin reductase then interacts with the redox-partner binding-site of a mitochondrial P450, such as P450scc, and the electrons then travel to the heme ring of the P450. ©WL Miller.

pregnenolone may exit the mitochondrion and become the substrate for P450c17 in the ER, which catalyzes both 17α-hydroxylase and 17,20 lyase activities. Pregnenolone appears to exit the mitochondrion unaided; no transport protein has been found, and physiologic evidence does not suggest the presence of such a transporter. Following the activities of 3βHSD and P450c17,

**P450c21 catalyzes the 21-hydroxylation of both glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids. The final steps in the synthesis of both glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids again takes place in the mitochondria, where two proteins that share 93% sequence identity, 11β-hydroxylase (P450c11β, CYP11B1), and aldosterone synthase (P450c11AS, CYP11B2) reside. P450c11β catalyzes the 11β-hydroxylation of 11-deoxycortisol to cortisol, and P450c11AS catalyzes the 11β-hydroxylation, 18-hydroxylation, and 18-methyl oxidation to convert deoxycorticosterone to aldosterone. Histologic and electron microscopic examination of steroidogenic cells suggests that domains of the ER containing the steroidogenic P450 enzymes come close to the OMM during hormonally-induced steroidogenesis, forming a steroidogenic complex, so that the movement of steroidal intermediates from the mitochondrion to the ER involves very small distances.**

**6.3. Chemistry and transcription of P450scc**

P450scc catalyzes three reactions: 22-hydroxylation of cholesterol, 20-hydroxylation of 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol, and oxidative scission of the C20-22 bond of 20(R), 22(R)-dihydroxycholesterol, yielding pregnenolone and isocaproaldehyde. The binding of cholesterol and 22-hydroxylation are rate-limiting, as the efficiencies ($k_{cat}/Km$) are much higher for the subsequent reactions, and the high $K_D$ of ~3000 nM drives the dissociation of pregnenolone from P450scc (Miller and Auchus, 2011). Alternatively, soluble hydroxysterols such as 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol can enter the mitochondrion readily, without the action of StAR and its associated machinery. Catalysis by P450scc is slow, with a net turnover of approximately 6–20 molecules of cholesterol per molecule of P450scc per second. The crystal structures of bovine (Mast et al., 2011) and human (Strushkevich et al., 2011) P450scc, the latter in complex with ferredoxin, show that the single active site of P450scc is in contact with the IMM.

Transcription of the CYP11A1 gene determines cellular steroidogenic capacity. This transcription is regulated by hormonally-responsive factors that differ in different types of steroidogenic cells; both the PKA and PKC second messenger systems can induce CYP11A1 transcription via different promoter elements. Adrenal and gonadal transcription of P450scc and other steroidogenic enzymes requires the action of steroidogenic factor 1 (SF1) (Schimmer and White, 2010). By contrast, placental expression of P450scc is constitutive, independent of SF1 and requires members of the CP2 (graineyhead) family of transcription factors (also known as LBP proteins) (Huang and Miller, 2000; Henderson et al., 2007) and TreP-132 (Gizard et al., 2002). Thus, long-term cellular stimulation over the course of days will increase the content of P450scc, and the level of basal steroid produced, as well as the capacity of the cell to mount a steroidogenic response.

**7. Electron transfer to P450scc: ferredoxin reductase and ferredoxin**

**7.1. Ferredoxin reductase**

Catalysis by P450scc and other mitochondrial P450 enzymes requires two electron-transfer intermediates, ferredoxin reductase and ferredoxin (Miller, 2005). Ferredoxin reductase receives electrons from NADPH then forms a 1:1 complex with ferredoxin, which then dissociates and forms an analogous 1:1 complex with a mitochondrial P450 such as P450scc, thus functioning as an indiscriminate, diffusible electron shuttle for all mitochondrial forms of P450 (Fig. 3). The relative abundances of ferredoxin reductase and ferredoxin, as well as the inherent properties of the mitochondrial P450, determine catalytic activity (Harikrishna et al.,

---

**1993). Genetic disorders of human ferredoxin reductase and ferredoxin have not been described, and mouse knockouts have not been reported. Mutation of the Drosophila ferredoxin reductase homologue dare causes developmental arrest and degeneration of the adult nervous system secondary to disrupted ecdysone production (Freeman et al., 1999).**

The human FDXR gene produces two alternatively spliced ferredoxin reductase mRNAs differing by 18 bp (Solish et al., 1988), but only the protein encoded by the more abundant, shorter mRNA is active (Brandt and Vickery, 1992). Ferredoxin reductase mRNA is widely expressed, but is far more abundant in steroidogenic tissues (Brentano et al., 1992). Ferredoxin reductase is a 54.5 kDa flavoprotein affixed to the IMM that consists of two domains, each comprising a β-sheet core surrounded by α-helices (Ziegler et al., 1999). The NADP(H)-binding domain is compact, whereas the domain that binds flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) is more open; this domain binds the dinucleotide portion of FAD across a Rossman fold with the redox-active flavin isoalloxazine ring abutting the NADP(H) domain. Electron transfer occurs in the cleft formed by these two domains. This cleft is characterized by basic residues that interact with acidic residues on ferredoxin.

---

**7.2. Ferredoxin**

The human FDX1 gene encodes ferredoxin (Fdx1), a 14 kDa, soluble, iron/sulfur (Fe₂S₂) protein that resides either free in the mitochondrial matrix or is loosely bound to the inner mitochondrial membrane (Miller, 2005). There are two human ferredoxins, Fdx1 and Fdx2, but only Fdx1 supports steroidogenic mitochondrial P450 enzymes; Fdx2 participates in the synthesis of heme and Fe/S cluster proteins (Sheftel et al., 2010). Ferredoxin has a core region containing four cysteine residues that tether the Fe₂S₂ cluster, and an interaction domain containing a helix with several charged residues, producing a negatively charged surface above the Fe₂S₂ cluster that interacts with the mitochondrial P450 (Muller et al., 1998).

---

**7.3. Mitochondrial P450 fusion proteins**

The same surface of ferredoxin interacts with both ferredoxin reductase and the P450; nevertheless, creation of three-component fusion proteins of the general scheme H₂N-P450-FerredoxinReductase-Ferredoxin-COOH (termed F2) increases Vmax. This design was first tested with P450scc (Harikrishna et al., 1993) and has been confirmed with P450c27 (Dilworth et al., 1996) and P450c11β (Cao et al., 2000). In such fusions, the ferredoxin moiety is at the C-terminus, tethered by a hydrophilic linker that permits rotational freedom, so that the same surface of the ferredoxin can access both the P450 and the ferredoxin reductase. The requirement for ferredoxin reductase and ferredoxin is not absolute, at least in vitro. When P450scc is fused to an alternative electron donor, microsomal P450 oxidoreductase and targeted of to the mitochondria, it remains active; by contrast when P450scc, its fusion protein, or other P450scc constructs are targeted to the ER, they are inactive even when supplied with the 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol substrate that bypasses the StAR system (Black et al., 1994). Thus the mitochondrial localization is essential for the enzymatic activity of P450scc.

**8. P450scc deficiency syndromes**

Three models of defective P450scc function, a spontaneously occurring CYP11A1 deletion in the rabbit (Yang et al., 1993), knockout of the gene in the mouse (Hu et al., 2002), and rare patients with P450scc mutations confirm that P450scc is the only enzyme

that converts cholesterol to pregnenolone. Because progesterone is  
needed to suppress uterine contractility and thus prevent spontaneous abortion, it would appear that P450scc mutations would be  
incompatible with term gestation; the mouse and rabbit models  
are explained by the persistence of the maternal corpus luteum  
in these species, providing an alternative source of progesterone.  
Nevertheless, beginning in 2001 (Tajima et al., 2001) 19 patients  
have been described with mutations in CYP11A1 that affect  
P450scc activity (Tee et al., 2013). Most of these patients have  
mutations that ablate all P450scc activity; they probably reached  
term gestation because of the maternal corpus luteum remained  
functional beyond the second trimester, when it normally involutes. These patients may be clinically indistinguishable from those  
with lipoid CAH. The 46,XY genetic males fail to produce testosterone during fetal life, and are born with female external genitalia,  
although their internal reproductive structures are male, as their  
testes produced anti-Müllerian hormone. Following birth, these  
patients require steroid hormone replacement therapy and may  
have long-term survival. As with non-classical lipoid CAH, a milder  
“non-classical” form of P450scc deficiency has been described  
caused by missense mutations that retain 10–20% of normal  
activity (Rubtsov et al., 2009; Sahakitrungruang et al., 2011). No  
hormonal test distinguishes lipoid CAH from P450scc deficiency,  
but the adrenals are typically grossly enlarged in lipoid CAH but  
normal-sized in P450scc deficiency, sometimes permitting radiologic distinction, but the only definitive test to distinguish these  
disorders is DNA sequencing (Gucev et al., 2013).

### 9. 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase

The 42 kDa 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3βHSD) is a  
member of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) family  
of enzymes, which are β-α-β proteins having up to seven parallel β-strands that fan across the center of the molecule, forming  
the so-called “Rossman fold”, which is characteristic of oxidation/reduction enzymes that use nicotinamide cofactors (Agarwal  
and Auchus, 2005; Penning, 1997). 3βHSD converts Δ5 steroids  
(pregnenolone, 17OH-pregneneolone, DHEA), having a double bond in the B ring to Δ4 steroids, having a double bond in the A  
ring (Miller and Auchus, 2011). Members of this family of enzymes lack mitochondrial leader peptides and are generally found in the cytosol. However, 3βHSD was first isolated from mitochondria  
(Thomas et al., 1989). This unexpected cellular localization was  
confirmed by immunogold electron microscopy showing that  
3βHSD immunoreactivity is found in mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum as well as in the cytoplasm of bovine adrenal zona glomerulosa cells (Cherradi et al., 1997; Pelletier et al., 2001). It  
is not clear if this is also true for human 3βHSD, or if this subcellular distribution differs in various types of steroidogenic cells, but  
this property could be a novel mechanism for regulating the direction of steroidogenesis. 3βHSD appears to be associated with  
P450scc on the IMM, and possibly at OMM-IMM contact sites  
(Cherradi et al., 1995). 3βHSD and 17α-hydroxylase (P450c17) compete for the pregnenolone produced by P450scc. The Michaelis constant (Km) for P450c17 in the ER is about 0.8 μM (Auchus et al.,  
1998), whereas the Km of 3βHSD is about 5.2–5.5 μM (Lee et al.,  
1999), so that an intramitochondrial location of 3βHSD will facilitate the formation of progesterone rather than 17OH-pregnenolone. During its mitochondrial entry, 3βHSD associates with several mitochondrial translocase proteins to reach the IMM (Pawlak et al., 2011) and undergoes a pH-dependent conformational change in the intramembranous space that facilitates its two enzymatic activities (Prasad et al., 2012).  
There are two 3βHSD genes and several pseudogenes in a gene cluster on chromosome 1p13.1. The two encoded 3βHSD enzymes  

are 93.5% identical with nearly indistinguishable enzymology, but  
with distinct distributions of expression. The type 1 enzyme catalyzes 3βHSD activity in placenta, breast, liver, brain and some other tissues, whereas the type 2 enzyme is expressed in the adrenals and gonads. Deficiency of 3βHSD 2 causes a rare form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (3βHSD deficiency); mutations have not been found in 3βHSD 1, possibly reflecting the impact of such a mutation on placental progesterone synthesis.

#### 10. Other steroidogenic mitochondrial P450 enzymes

Adrenocortical mitochondria contain two additional P450 enzymes: P450c11β (11β-hydroxylase) is found in zona fasciculata cells where it catalyzes the conversion of 11-deoxycortisol to cortisol; P450c11AS (aldosterone synthase) is found in zona glomerulosa cells where it catalyzes the three distinct reactions needed to convert deoxycorticosterone to aldosterone (White et al., 1994; Fardella and Miller, 1996; Miller and Auchus, 2011). These two proteins share 93% amino acid sequence identity and are encoded by duplicated genes termed CYP11B1 (producing P450c11β) and CYP11B2 (producing P450c11AS). Like P450scc, both proteins have typical mitochondrial targeting sequence and are associated with the IMM. These enzymes must compete with P450scc for reducing equivalents provided via ferredoxin reductase and ferredoxin. Mutations in CYP11B1 cause 11β-hydroxylase deficiency, a rare form of virilizing congenital adrenal hyperplasia in which the overproduction of deoxycorticosterone may lead to mineralocorticoid hypertension. Mutations in CYP11B2 cause aldosterone synthase deficiency. An unusual recombination between the CYP11B1 and CYP11B2 genes can place the CYP11B1 promoter upstream from the CYP11B2 gene, thus producing aldosterone synthase in response to ACTH, causing glucocorticoid suppressible hyperaldosteronism.

#### 11. Mitochondrial P450 enzymes in vitamin D synthesis

Vitamin D and its metabolites are not steroids in the strict chemical sense, as the B ring of cholesterol is opened (Fig. 4). Nevertheless, these sterols are derived from cholesterol, assume shapes that are very similar to steroids, and bind to a similar, zinc-finger receptor that regulates gene transcription (Feldman et al., 2013). The final step in the biosynthesis of cholesterol is conversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol to cholesterol. In human skin, ultraviolet radiation at 270–290 nm directly cleaves the 9–10 carbon bond of the cholesterol B ring, converting 7-dehydrocholesterol to cholecalciferol (vitamin D₃) (Norman, 1998). Plants produce ergocalciferol (vitamin D₂), which has essentially the same properties as cholecalciferol. Both calciferols are biologically inactive pro-hormones that are then activated, and subsequently inactivated, by mitochondrial P450 enzymes.  
The initial step in the activation of vitamin D is its hepatic 25-hydroxylation to 25(OH)D, which may be catalyzed by several enzymes. The principal 25-hydroxylase is CYP2R1 (Cheng et al., 2003), and deficiency of this enzyme causes the very rare 25-hydroxylase deficiency syndrome (Cheng et al., 2004; Dong and Miller, 2004). A hepatic mitochondrial P450 (variously termed P450c25 and P450c27) encoded by the CYP27A1 gene also has vitamin D 25-hydroxylase activity, but its mutation causes cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis without a disorder in calcium metabolism (Cali et al., 1991; Leitersdorf et al., 1993), hence this mitochondrial enzyme is of marginal importance to vitamin D metabolism.  
The active, hormonal form of vitamin D, 1,25(OH)₂D, is produced by the 1α-hydroxylation of 25(OH)D by the mitochondrial 1α-hydroxylase, P450c1α, encoded by the CYP27B1 gene (Fu et al., 1997a,b). 1,25(OH)₂D in the circulation derives primarily

Fig. 4. Biosynthesis of vitamin D₃. Ultraviolet light at 290–320 nm acts on the skin to cleave the B ring of 7-dehydrocholesterol to yield cholecalciferol (vitamin D₃). Vitamin D is converted to 25OHD by several enzymes in the liver, principally CYP2R1. 25OHD is activated by 1α-hydroxylation in the kidney, yielding the active hormone 1,25(OH)₂D, which acts by binding to the vitamin D receptor (VDR). Both 25OHD and 1,25(OH)₂D may be inactivated by P450c24 to yield 24,25(OH)₂D or 1,24,25(OH)₃D, respectively.

from the kidney, but 1α-hydroxylase activity is also found in keratinocytes, macrophages, osteoblasts and placenta. 1α-hydroxylation is the rate-limiting step in the activation of vitamin D, and renal enzyme activity is tightly regulated by parathyroid hormone (PTH), calcium, phosphorus, and 1,25(OH)₂D itself. The first human clone was obtained from human keratinocytes, but multiple studies, including finding mutations in a patient affected with renal 1α-hydroxylase deficiency, proved that the same gene was expressed in kidney (Fu et al., 1997a). Mutations in this gene cause the disorder variously termed ‘vitamin D-dependent rickets, Type 1’, ‘pseudo vitamin D-deficient rickets’ and ‘vitamin D 1α-hydroxylase deficiency’ (Wang et al., 1998; Kim et al., 2007). The single CYP27B1 gene for 1α-hydroxylase is only 5 kb long and has an intron/exon organization that is very similar to that of other mitochondrial P450 enzymes, especially the mitochondrial cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme, P450scc (Fu et al., 1997b). Thus, even though the mitochondrial P450 enzymes retain only 30–40% amino acid sequence identity with each other, they all belong to a single evolutionary lineage. More than 100 patients with CYP27B1 mutations have been described (Edouard et al., 2011).

1,25(OH)₂D may be inactivated by the principal hepatic drug-metabolizing enzyme, microsomal CYP3A4, or by its 24-hydroxylation by vitamin D 24-hydroxylase (P450c24), encoded by the CYP24A1 gene (Feldman et al., 2013). This mitochondrial enzyme can catalyze the 24-hydroxylation of 25(OH)D to 24,25(OH)₂D and of 1,25(OH)₂D to 1,24,25(OH)₃D, primarily in the kidney and intestine, thus inactivating vitamin D (Ohyama et al., 1991; Chen et al., 1993). The expression of P450c24 is induced by 1,25(OH)₂D, providing a direct feedback mechanism to autoregulate circulating levels of 1,25(OH)₂D (Xie et al., 2002). The crystal structure of rat P450c24 has been determined, showing a classic cytochrome P450 fold with an open conformation which would suggest that this enzyme might bind multiple different substrates, nevertheless, like all other mitochondrial P450’s, P450c24 exhibits a narrow substrate specificity (Annalora et al., 2010). Rare mutations in P450c24 result in elevated circulating concentrations of 1,25(OH)₂D, causing severe neonatal hypercalcaemia (Schlingmann et al., 2011; Dauber et al., 2012).
