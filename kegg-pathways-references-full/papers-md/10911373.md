Contraction and relaxation of smooth muscle is a tightly regulated process involving numerous endogenous substances and their intracellular second messengers. We examine the key role of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) in mediating smooth muscle relaxation. We briefly review the current art regarding cGMP generation and degradation, while focusing on the recent identification of the molecular mechanisms underlying cGMP-mediated smooth muscle relaxation. cGMP-induced SM relaxation is mediated mainly by cGMP-dependent protein kinase activation. It involves several molecular events culminating in a reduction in intracellular Ca²⁺ concentration and a decrease in the sensitivity of the contractile system to Ca²⁺. We propose that the cGMP-induced decrease in Ca²⁺ sensitivity is a strategic way to achieve “active relaxation” of the smooth muscle. In summary, we present compelling evidence supporting a key role for cGMP as a mediator of smooth muscle relaxation in physiological and pharmacological settings. J. Cell.

Smooth muscle (SM) is an integral part of most mammalian organ systems. Its contractility is fundamental to many physiological processes such as the maintenance of vascular tone and pressure, uterine contractions resulting in parturition, intestinal motility related to the digestive process, and many others. As such, a variety of clinical disorders reflect abnormalities of SM activity including hypertension, bronchial asthma, and preterm birth. In those conditions, contractility is distorted by an altered balance between contractile and relaxing agents. However, intrinsic disorders of the SM itself cannot be discarded as part of the disease. Drugs that modify SM contraction/relaxation, such as vasodilators, bronchodilators, and uterine contraction inhibitors have been studied extensively and proven useful in some clinical settings.

SM contraction is initiated by an increase in the cytoplasmic Ca²⁺ concentration, permitting the interaction between the contractile proteins, actin and myosin. SM relaxation has classically been described as a default process resulting from the reduction of intracellular free calcium concentration ([Ca²⁺]i) following a decrease or loss in the contractile stimulus. However, SM relaxation can also be achieved by the active extrusion of Ca²⁺ and by a reduction in the sensitivity of the contractile system to Ca²⁺. We define *active relaxation* as a state of smooth muscle relaxation and relative refractoriness to the contractile agonist, as happens, for example, with uterine quiescence during pregnancy.

Smooth muscle relaxation is elicited by a multiplicity of endogenous and exogenous compounds. These agents reduce SM tone in a number of ways, including inhibition of the synthesis of a contractile agonist, blockade of receptors mediating SM contraction, and closure of Ca²⁺ channels located in the plasma membrane. These compounds can also interact with specific receptors located on either the SM cellular membrane or its cytoplasm, to generate intracellular second messengers that, in turn, initiate a cascade of molecular events leading to relaxation.

The intracellular second messengers involved in SM relaxation are the cyclic nucleotides, cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), generated by the activity of adenylate and guanylate cyclases, respectively. They exert their intracellular effects by activating a specific protein kinase: cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) or cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG), correspondingly. Cyclic AMP is the dominant mediator of SM relaxation stimulated by β-adrenergic drugs, whereas

(Moncada et al., 1991) or carbon monoxide (CO) (Morita et al., 1995). The second pathway consists of a family of particulate guanylate cyclases (p-GC) that act as membrane receptor for the natriuretic peptide family (Maack, 1992) (Fig. 1).

Soluble guanylate cyclase: nitric oxide-carbon monoxide. s-GC is expressed in most cells of the cardiovascular system and in many other cell types (Vaan- drager and de Jonge, 1996). Gene regulation of s-GC expression is not completely elucidated. However, s-GC mRNA and protein levels change in response to different physiological conditions and development states (Papapetopoulos et al., 1995; Bloch et al., 1997). sGC is composed of two subunits (α and β) and functions as a heterodimer. It contains a prosthetic heme group that functions as the receptor domain for NO (Vaandrager and de Jonge, 1996; Bloch et al., 1997) and CO (Morita et al., 1995). Three different cDNA sequences have been demonstrated for both the α (α₁– α₃) and the β (β₁– β₃) subunits. The α₃ and β₃ isoforms are primarily expressed in human vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) (Papapetopoulos et al., 1996).

NO is a paracrine modulator of many physiological processes within the cardiovascular, nervous, and immune systems. It is synthesized by one of three nitric oxide synthases (NOS) via the conversion of L-arginine and oxygen to L-citruline and NO. Several isoforms of NOS have been isolated and characterized, and functionally they are grouped as: (1) constitutive calcium-dependent NOS, including neural (nNOS) and endothelial NOS (eNOS), and (2) inducible calcium-independent NOS (iNOS), extensively reviewed by Moncada et al. (1991).

NO acts in a paracrine/autocrine manner after synthesis, diffusing from its production site to the target cell where it interacts with specific molecules containing iron in either a heme or iron-sulfur complex (Sato and Murota, 1995). The most important target for NO is s-GC, where binding to the heme moiety activates the enzyme, increasing the intracellular concentration of cGMP. cGMP is considered the main mediator of the cellular effects produced by NO (Bina et al., 1995; Kannan and Johnson, 1995; Moro et al., 1996; Peng et al., 1996; Quignard et al., 1997).

The NO-cGMP pathway is responsible, at least in part, for the vascular smooth muscle relaxation produced by many agents, including nitrovasodilators (Kelly and Smith, 1996; Van Riper et al., 1997), histamine (Pussard et al., 1995), acetylcholine (Pussard et al., 1995; Iranami et al., 1996), estrogens (White et al., 1995; Rosenfeld et al., 1996), insulin (Trovati et al., 1995; Trovati et al., 1996), and corticotrophin-releasing hormone (Clifton et al., 1995). These agents stimulate the endothelial cell to produce and release NO, which in turn acts on the SMC to increase cGMP production. The ability of NO to relax SM has been described in multiple models and muscle types, including tracheal smooth muscle (Jia et al., 1995; Kannan and Johnson, 1995; Ward et al., 1995; Sadeghi-Hashjin et al., 1996; Yamakage et al., 1996), vascular smooth muscle (Landgraf et al., 1986; White et al., 1995; Moro et al., 1996; Olson et al., 1997), and myometrium (Buhimschi et al., 1995; Kuenzli et al., 1996; Nakanishi et al., 1996; Norman et al., 1997; Hennan and Diamond, 1998).

It was initially thought that the relaxation stimu

Fig. 1. Cyclic guanosine 3′,5′ monophosphate (cGMP) generation, degradation, and action. In the smooth muscle cell, cGMP is generated from GTP by the activity of either soluble (s-GC) or particulate (p-GC) guanylate cyclase after activation by a paracrine mediator released from a neighbor cell. s-GC is cytosolic protein activated upon binding nitric oxide (NO) or carbon monoxide (CO). p-GC is a membrane receptor for a family of natriuretic peptides (ANP, BNP, CNP, guanylin, and urodilatin). cGMP is degraded by the action of one of several phosphodiesterases (PDE) and is not stored. Once generated, cGMP exerts its intracellular action on SM by binding one of three kinds of intracellular receptor proteins.

cGMP-mediated relaxation is triggered by nitric oxide (NO) and natriuretic peptides (NPs). Classically, cAMP was seen as the principal second messenger involved in SM relaxation; hence several β-adrenergic drugs were developed and used to alter SM tone for the management of a number of pathologic conditions in humans. However, as is described in this review, recent evidence indicates a primary role for cGMP and PKG that supersedes that of cAMP and PKA in the relaxation of SM by endogenous or exogenous compounds.

In this study, we review the molecular mechanisms involved in SM relaxation induced by cGMP and describe how active relaxation may be achieved. We briefly review the generation and degradation of cGMP, while focusing on how this molecule acts to mediate SM relaxation. Finally, we explore the cross talk between the pathways of cAMP and cGMP, and present compelling evidence of a principal role for the cGMP-PKG cascade in SM relaxation during physiological and pharmacological situations.

### CYCLIC GMP: GENERATION AND DEGRADATION

Although discovered in 1963, cGMP's importance in many cellular and physiological processes was first described in the late 1970s (Lincoln and Cornwell, 1993; Baumner and Nawrath, 1995; Moro et al., 1996; Vaandrager and de Jonge, 1996). cGMP is generated by guanylate cyclase (GC) and degraded by specific cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDE). It exerts its intracellular effects by interacting with a group of intracellular proteins known as intracellular cGMP receptor proteins (Lincoln and Cornwell, 1993) (Fig. 1).

#### Guanylate cyclases

cGMP is generated by one of two enzyme pathways. The first is soluble guanylate cyclase (s-GC), which converts GTP to cGMP after activation by either NO
lated by NO was mediated only by cGMP. This led to the assumption that NO and cGMP actions were synonymous in smooth muscle. However, it is now known from work with several models, including the canine middle cerebral artery (Onoue and Katusic, 1998); rat aorta (Kanagy et al., 1996) and mesenteric artery (Plane et al., 1996); guinea pig bronchial smooth muscle (Wong et al., 1995); and porcine tracheal smooth muscle (Stuart-Smith et al., 1998), that at least part of NO-induced SM relaxation is cGMP independent.

CO also generates cGMP by activating s-GC. Recent evidence links CO production with the control of SM activity in the maintenance of uterine quiescence during pregnancy (Acevedo and Ahmed, 1998) and in the control of vascular tone (Christodoulides et al., 1995; Morita and Kourembanas, 1995; Morita et al., 1995, 1997). However, similar to NO, other, non-cGMP mechanisms of CO-induced relaxation were demonstrated (Wang et al., 1997a,b).

Particulate guanylate cyclase: natriuretic peptides. Particulate guanylate cyclases are complex transmembrane molecules with an extracellular domain that serve as the receptor site for the family of natriuretic peptides (NPs), and two intracellular domains: a guanylate cyclase (similar to that of s-GC) and a tyrosine kinase (homologous to the PDGF receptor). The latter probably acts as a repressor of the guanylate cyclase activity (Maack, 1992, 1996; Vaandrager and de Jonge, 1996).

Six isoforms of the NP cellular receptors with guanylate cyclase activity have been identified to date. An additional “clearance receptor” that lacks the guanylate cyclase intracellular domain has also been identified (Vaandrager and de Jonge, 1996; Foster et al., 1999). There is some terminology confusion in the literature because, when the first two guanylate cyclases and the clearance receptor were described, they were identified as GC-A, -B, and -C, respectively. However, a guanylate cyclase type C receptor was subsequently described as the specific receptor for the heat-stable toxin of *E. coli* and given the name of GC-C (Foster et al., 1999). Thus we identify the guanylate cyclase receptors as A to F (GC-A to GC-F) and the “clearance receptor” with its name.

The most extensively studied GC receptors are types A and B. When natriuretic peptides bind and activate these receptors, they trigger an increase in intracellular cGMP. The clearance receptor has a very short cytoplasmic domain in common with all clearance receptors (Maack, 1996). Its principal function appears to be the modulation of NP action (Matsukawa et al., 1999). When NPs bind to the clearance receptor, they are internalized, the complex dissociated, the peptide degraded, and the receptor recycled to the membrane surface (Brenner et al., 1990; Rosenzweig and Seidman, 1991; Maack, 1992).

There is also evidence that clearance receptors have a signaling function (Cao et al., 1995; Savoie et al., 1995; Trachte et al., 1995; Murthy and Makhlouf, 1999). The clearance receptor mediates NP-induced neuromodulation (Drewett et al., 1990; Johnson et al., 1991; Drewett et al., 1992; Trachte, 1993). Its activation by NPs determines adenylate cyclase inhibition (Drewett et al., 1992; Anand-Srivastava et al., 1996) and phospholipase C activation (Anand-Srivastava and

Trachte, 1993) through a G protein–coupled mechanism (Murthy and Makhlouf, 1999).

Natriuretic peptides are a family of proteins with multiple biological actions. Those identified to date include atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP), urodilatin, and guanylin (Rosenzweig and Seidman, 1991). ANP and BNP are produced principally in myocardial cells, released by atrial distention, and involved in the control of body fluid, electrolyte balance, and systemic arterial pressure (Brenner et al., 1990; Rosenzweig and Seidman, 1991; Maack, 1992; Sala et al., 1995; Maack, 1996; Grantham et al., 1997).

CNP was initially discovered in the pig brain (Sudoh et al., 1990), but was subsequently isolated from the chicken, rat, and human brain, suggesting that its biological actions were limited to the central nervous system (Tao et al., 1995). However, CNP was later found in many other tissues and its production demonstrated in cultured human endothelial cells (Komatsu et al., 1996a), expanding our understanding of its biological action (Rosenzweig and Seidman, 1991). The discovery of the CNP gene expression in endothelial cells and the presence of its receptor in SMCs led to the proposal of the existence of a vascular natriuretic peptide system (Komatsu et al., 1996b). It was also suggested that the production and secretion of CNP from endothelial cells regulates both the contractile state and the proliferative activity of underlying SMCs in a paracrine fashion, as is well described for the endothelium-derived relaxing factor, whose principal component is NO (Igaki et al., 1996; Komatsu et al., 1996b).

Both ANP and BNP bind to the GC-A receptor with similar affinities, which is greater than the affinity of CNP for GC-A. The GC-B receptor is specific for CNP. The affinity of all three peptides for the clearance receptor is similar (Koller et al., 1991; Suga et al., 1992). The distribution of the NP receptors varies among tissues (De Leon et al., 1995; Dos Reis et al., 1995). It appears to be transcriptionally regulated at different developmental stages (Brown and Chen, 1995) and in different physiological or pathological states (Yoshimoto et al., 1996), thus dictating the effects of the different NPs on a specific tissue.

Similar to NO, it was originally thought that all the cellular events stimulated by NPs were mediated exclusively by cGMP, including such properties as SM relaxation, inhibition of platelet aggregation, and growth inhibition (Brenner et al., 1990). However, there is now strong evidence that at least part of the NPs’ actions is mediated by the clearance receptor through a mechanism not linked to cGMP production (Anand-Srivastava and Trachte, 1993). The signaling function of the clearance receptor has been studied in several tissues, including vascular SMCs, but its role in SM relaxation induced by NPs has yet to be investigated.

### Phosphodiesterases

Another aspect involved in the regulation of cGMP is its rate of catabolism, which depends strictly on the activity of the cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (PDE). PDE transforms cyclic nucleotides into inactive 5′-nucleotide monophosphates. Thus, pharmacologic regulation of PDE activity (Table 1) is important for

¹ Cyclic nucleotides phosphodiesterases (PDE) transform cyclic nucleotides (cAMP and cGMP) into inactive monophosphate nucleotides (AMP or GMP) and thus are involved in the modulation of cGMP cellular action. There are a large number of PDE proteins grouped in seven gene families, which differ in characteristics and substrate affinity. Several pharmacological inhibitors of PDE activity have been developed and tested. Some (*) are selective. Data are based on studies by Beavo (1995), Conti and Jin (1999), Coste and Grondin (1995), Haynes et al. (1996), Miyahara et al. (1995), Saeki et al. (1995), Satake et al. (1995), Silver et al. (1998), Thusu et al. (1995), Truss et al. (1995), Yu et al. (1995), and Ziegler et al. (1995).

the control of intracellular cGMP and therefore its actions (Miyahara et al., 1995; Saeki et al., 1995; Thusu et al., 1995; Yu et al., 1995; Ziegler et al., 1995; Dent and Giembycz, 1996; Haynes et al., 1996).

The family of PDEs is large, consisting of complex proteins that differ in substrate affinity, kinetic properties, subcellular localization, and Ca²⁺ sensitivity (Leroy et al., 1985). In mammalian cells, at least 20 genes and 50 different PDE proteins are described. They are grouped into seven gene families named PDE I to PDE VII (Conti and Jin, 1999) (Table 1). Each family has several distinct genes, alternative splice variants, and characteristic tissue expression (Beavo, 1995; Miyahara et al., 1995; Reinhardt et al., 1995). In humans, more than 25 PDEs belonging to the seven families are identified (Beavo, 1995). PDE action can be modified by changes in protein concentration or by the modification of enzymatic activity typically via phosphorylation/dephosphorylation mechanisms. These observations suggest that PDE regulation may be involved in physiological control of cyclic nucleotide bioaction including SM tone (Kofinas et al., 1987; Wyatt et al., 1998; Leroy et al., 1999).

CYCLIC GMP: INTRACELLULAR RECEPTOR PROTEINS

Regardless of whether cGMP is generated via s-GC or p-GC, it exerts its effect by coupling to one of three possible groups of receptor proteins: cGMP-regulated ion channels, cGMP-binding phosphodiesterases, and cGMP-dependent protein kinases (Fig. 2). The resulting action of cGMP depends mostly on the cell-specific expression of these various proteins (Lincoln and Cornwell, 1993; Vaandrager and de Jonge, 1996).

cGMP-regulated ion channels

Ion channels directly regulated by cGMP are described in retinal cells (rods), olfactory cells, and renal epithelium (Lincoln and Cornwell, 1993). The photoreceptor cGMP-gated channel found in the retinal cell rod is a Na⁺ and Ca²⁺ channel. This protein channel contains 609 amino acids, has a six-membrane-spanning region in its NH₂-terminal and a cGMP-binding domain in its COOH-terminal region. In visual transduction, the increase in intracellular cGMP results in a rapid and transient depolarization of the membrane. The olfactory channel is activated by cGMP or cAMP, whereas the renal epithelium channel, an amiloride-

Inside the cell, cGMP can bind and modify the activity of three types of intracellular receptor proteins. cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) is considered the principal mediator of cGMP-induced SM relaxation by phosphorylating a number of target proteins. The role of cGMP-gated ion channels and cGMP-sensitive phosphodiesterases (PDE) in cGMP-induced SM relaxation has not been evaluated.

sensitive channel, is inhibited by cGMP (Lincoln and Cornwell, 1993). Because cGMP directly regulated ion channels have not yet been reported in SM, they are not discussed here as a possible target for cGMP-mediated smooth muscle relaxation.

### cGMP-binding phosphodiesterases

There are three types of PDEs regulated allosterically by cGMP: type II (cGMP-stimulated PDE), type III (cGMP-inhibited PDE), and type V (cGMP-specific PDE) (Lincoln and Cornwell, 1993). Hence, the actions of cGMP may also depend on the specific PDE type expressed in the cell (Vaandrager and de Jonge, 1996).

Type II PDE is a dimer, whose catalytic domain is found in the COOH-terminal; its cGMP allosteric binding site is localized to the NH₂-terminal. The binding of cGMP to the allosteric site increases hydrolyzing activity. In contrast to type II PDE, the binding of cGMP to the allosteric site of type V PDE does not alter hydrolyzing properties. Type III PDE has two forms: one that is inhibited by cGMP binding and one that is cGMP insensitive (Lincoln and Cornwell, 1993). The cGMP-sensitive isoform is important because, based on its affinity for cAMP, the PDE type III is considered to be a “cAMP-prefering” enzyme (Ruiz-Velasco et al., 1998). The importance of this mechanism as a mediator of cGMP cellular actions has not been adequately studied. It is possible that changes in PDE activity induced

by cGMP would be reflected in altered cAMP and cGMP levels, increasing or decreasing their activity, depending on the main PDE expressed in the cellular type. It has not yet been established whether there is a role for this mechanism in cGMP-induced SM relaxation.

### cGMP-dependent protein kinase

It is believed that the binding and activation of cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) is responsible for most of the intracellular actions of cGMP. Although expressed in many cell types, these serine/threonine protein kinases are found at high levels only in the lung, cerebellum, platelets, and SMCs (Francis and Corbin, 1994). The canonical phosphorylation site Arg-Arg-X-Ser is the same described for PKA (Vaandrager and de Jonge, 1996). Two classes of PKG with similar substrate specificity are described (Vaandrager and de Jonge, 1996): type I has two isoforms (type I-α and type I-β); type II is less common and expressed only in intestinal epithelial cells (Lincoln and Cornwell, 1993), kidney, and brain (Vaandrager and de Jonge, 1996).

Type I PKG is a homodimer. Each subunit contains a dimerization domain; two cGMP-binding domains; and an autophosphorylation-autoinhibitory domain, the relevance of which is poorly understood. It is thought that the autophosphorylation of PKG after activation by cGMP prolongs the duration of the activated state (Francis and Corbin, 1994; Vaandrager and de Jonge, 1996). Further, autophosphorylation activates PKG by a molecular mechanism similar to cGMP binding (Chu et al., 1998). Type I PKG is derived from a single gene located on chromosome 10 in humans; splice variants result in the production of the distinct protein isoforms (Lincoln and Cornwell, 1993; Francis and Corbin, 1994; Tamura et al., 1996). Expression of type I PKG is downregulated by PDGF, TGF-β, and TNF-α in human cultured SMCs (Tamura et al., 1996).

Type II PKG is a monomeric kinase with a catalytic domain at its COOH-terminal and two cGMP-binding domains at its NH₂-terminal. In general, type II PKG is membrane bound, whereas type I PKG is located in the soluble fraction of the cell. Chemotactic stimulation elicits translocation of PKG, suggesting that PKG anchoring proteins control the targeting of PKG to specific compartments (Francis and Corbin, 1994; Tamura et al., 1996; Van Riper et al., 1997), where it exerts cellular functions (Cornwell et al., 1991).

PKG is selectively activated by cGMP binding. Once activated, it phosphorylates several intracellular target proteins. Phosphorylation modulates the activity of these proteins and accounts for many of the cellular events induced by cGMP, including smooth muscle relaxation (Lincoln and Cornwell, 1993; Andriantsitohaina et al., 1995; Baumnner and Nawrath, 1995; Draijer et al., 1995; Murphy-Ullrich et al., 1996; Vaandrager and de Jonge, 1996; Murad, 1997; Yu et al., 1997).

#### MECHANISM OF cGMP-MEDIATED SMOOTH MUSCLE RELAXATION

It is generally accepted that cGMP triggers relaxation of SM by activating an intracellular molecular cascade, which revolves around the activity of PKG. This cascade results in a reduction of cytosolic Ca²⁺ through a series of complex and poorly understood mechanisms (Lincoln et al., 1994). The roles of the other cGMP intracellular receptor proteins are unknown. Further, conflicting evidence has emerged regarding the ability of cGMP to relax smooth muscle. Based on a decreased response to cGMP analogs, it was suggested that certain types of smooth muscles are “sensitive,” whereas others are “nonsensitive” to cGMP-induced relaxation (Hennan and Diamond, 1998; Syal et al., 1998; Word and Cornwell, 1998).

Based on our current understanding of smooth muscle contraction, we propose the existence of two mechanisms for smooth muscle relaxation: the first is the reduction of intracellular Ca²⁺, and the second is the reduction of the sensitivity of the contractile system to the Ca²⁺. The evidence supporting the conclusion that cGMP induces SM relaxation using both mechanisms is described below.

##### Reduction of intracellular Ca²⁺ concentration

cGMP triggers a reduction in [Ca²⁺]i through the activation of PKG. Activated PKG phosphorylates several key target proteins, including ion channels, ion pumps, receptors, and enzymes, all involved in the control of intracellular Ca²⁺ concentration. Phosphorylation of these target proteins reduces [Ca²⁺]i and results in relaxation of SM.

##### Activation of Ca²⁺-activated K⁺ channels

Ca²⁺-activated K⁺ channels (KCa) are a family of channel proteins expressed in multiple cell types, including SMCs. The efflux of K⁺ through these channels is directly related to the concentration of Ca²⁺. Once activated, the channel acts as a negative feedback regulator, hyperpolarizing the cell membrane and inhibiting the entrance of Ca²⁺ through nearby voltage-gated Ca²⁺ channels. Reduction of the Ca²⁺ influx through the voltage-gated Ca²⁺ channels leads to SM relaxation (Kannan and Johnson, 1995; Trongvanichnam et al., 1996; Yamakage et al., 1996; Zhou et al., 1996).

Several investigators have shown in rat mesenteric artery, guinea pig and human trachea, isolated porcine tracheal SMCs, and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells that cGMP-PKG pathway activation increases the activity of KCa channels by phosphorylation of either the channel protein or a related regulatory protein (Yamakage et al., 1996; Zhou et al., 1996; Mikawa et al., 1998; Tanaka et al., 1998). Similar observations were made in porcine coronary arteries, demonstrating that the NO-cGMP-PKG pathway induces SM relaxation by a KCa channel-dependent mechanism (White et al., 1995).

After comparing the differential effect of PKG action on freshly isolated myometrial cells and CHO cells transfected with human Ca²⁺-activated K⁺ channel, it was proposed that the action of PKG on KCa channels depends on the presence of unidentified intracellular cofactors (Zhou et al., 1998). The mechanism of the PKG-related increase in KCa channel activity requires protein phosphatase type 2A (PP2A), a serine/threonine protein phosphatase. It is hypothesized that PKG phosphorylates and activates PP2A, which in turn leads to the activation of the KCa channel through dephosphorylation, rather than phosphorylation (Zhou et al., 1996). Recent reports dispute this suggestion. The cGMP-PKG pathway activation increases KCa channel activity, in human pulmonary vascular SMCs,
by a mechanism not inhibited by okadaic acid, a non-specific protein phosphatase inhibitor (Peng et al., 1996). Thus, although PKG activity increases K⁺ flux through the Kca channel, its mechanism of action remains unknown.

**Direct inhibition of membrane Ca²⁺ channel activity.** Membrane voltage-dependent Ca²⁺ channels, which normally open in response to membrane depolarization, can also be regulated by various protein kinases (Horowitz et al., 1996). This suggests the possibility of a direct PKG effect on the Ca²⁺ channel. Phosphorylation of membrane Ca²⁺ channels decreases [Ca²⁺]i, leading to relaxation of SM (Tewari and Simard, 1997).

NO donors decrease, in a dose-dependent fashion, Ca²⁺ channel availability in cell-attached patches of isolated guinea pig arterial SMCs via a cGMP-PKG-mediated mechanism. These observations suggest that PKG phosphorylates either the Ca²⁺ channel or a closely associated regulatory protein, reducing the probability that the channel remains in its open state (Tewari and Simard, 1997). Similar findings are reported for the Ca²⁺ channel in human coronary myocytes (Quignard et al., 1997). Finally, studies of rabbit pulmonary arterial cells, using patch-clamp techniques, also suggest that the inhibitory effect of NO donors is mediated by a direct inhibition of a voltage-gated dihydropyridine-sensitive Ca²⁺ channel (Clapp and Gurney, 1991).

**Activation of Ca²⁺/ATPase pump in the plasma membrane.** Ca²⁺ extrusion across the plasma membrane is thought to be a main mechanism mediating smooth muscle relaxation via [Ca²⁺]i reduction. It can occur by either Na⁺-dependent or Na⁺-independent mechanisms. In rat aortic SMCs, cGMP increases the Na⁺-independent Ca²⁺ efflux via activation of the Ca²⁺/ATPase pump. Na⁺-dependent Ca²⁺ efflux through the Na⁺/Ca²⁺ exchanger is not similarly affected (Furukawa et al., 1988).

An indirect mechanism for the activation of the Ca²⁺/ATPase pump has also been proposed. PKG may increase the intracellular generation of phosphatidylinositol-4 phosphate (PI-4P) by the phosphorylation and activation of phosphatidylinositol kinase (PI-kinase). PI-4P binds and activates the Ca²⁺/ATPase pump, increasing the Ca²⁺ current (Vrolix et al., 1988). Alternatively, it has been postulated that PKG phosphorylates an intermediate 240-kDa protein that is responsible for the activation of the Ca²⁺/ATPase membrane pump (Yoshida et al., 1991). Whatever the mechanism of activation, studies using membrane preparations of SMCs demonstrate that PKG is a better activator of Ca²⁺/ATPase activity than either PKA or protein kinase C (PKC) (Rashatwar et al., 1987).

**Activation of Ca²⁺/ATPase pump in the sarcoplasmic reticulum.** Ca²⁺/ATPase pump activation is responsible for the uptake of Ca²⁺ into the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), actively decreasing [Ca²⁺]i and thereby relaxing the SMC. The reduction in [Ca²⁺]i induced by cGMP is, at least in part, mediated by the activation of this Ca²⁺/ATPase pump (Clapp and Gurney, 1991).

The activity of the Ca²⁺/ATPase pump in the SR is regulated by the protein phospholamban (Horowitz et al., 1996). In rat aortic SMCs, cGMP-activated PKG phosphorylates the protein phospholamban. This phosphorylation increases Ca²⁺/ATPase pump activity and sequestration of Ca²⁺ into the SR, thereby inducing SM relaxation (Cornwell et al., 1991). Further, NO-induced relaxation of pig coronary artery correlates with the degree of phospholamban phosphorylation (Karczewski et al., 1998). Interestingly, phospholamban and PKG colocalized in the same cell region of SMC with the use of confocal laser scanning microscopy. This suggests that PKG plays an important role in the phospholamban regulation of the Ca²⁺/ATPase pump (Cornwell et al., 1991). In fact, the phosphorylation of phospholamban in cardiac and SMCs is coincident with an increase in the affinity of the Ca²⁺/ATPase pump for Ca²⁺ and thereby an increase in Ca²⁺ uptake by the SR (Raeymaekers et al., 1988).

**Inhibition of the inositol triphosphate receptor.** After its generation by phospholipase C (PLC) activity, inositol triphosphate (IP₃) acts as a second intracellular messenger for SM contraction by binding to a specific receptor. The IP₃ receptor is a channel protein located in the sarcoplasmic reticulum, which opens when bound to IP₃. The open IP₃ receptor channel permits Ca²⁺ efflux into the cytoplasm, resulting in contraction of the SM (Komalavilas and Lincoln, 1994). The IP₃ receptor is one of the best-known substrates of PKG. In cultured rat aortic SMCs (Komalavilas and Lincoln, 1994) and in isolated rat arteries (Komalavilas and Lincoln, 1996), PKG phosphorylates serine at position 1755 of the IP₃ receptor (Komalavilas and Lincoln, 1994). Phosphorylation of the IP₃ receptor reduces the channel activity in response to IP₃, leading to a decrease in [Ca²⁺]i and SM relaxation (Komalavilas and Lincoln, 1994, 1996).

**Inhibition of inositol triphosphate generation.** Because IP₃ is the principal compound responsible for releasing of Ca²⁺ from intracellular stores, the inhibition of IP₃ formation by PLC is an attractive potential mechanism of action for cGMP's capacity to induce SM relaxation. Indeed, cGMP inhibits the activity of PLC, either directly or by the inhibition of the G protein-coupled receptor that stimulates PLC activity (Lincoln and Cornwell, 1993). Based on experiments using vascular SMCs from spontaneously hypertensive rats and from controls, it appears that cGMP reduces the intracellular increase in IP₃ induced by angiotensin II (Baines et al., 1996).

In CHO cells transfected with PKG type I-α, the activated PKG phosphorylates and inactivates the α subunit of the G protein coupled to the insulin-like growth factor receptor. Receptor inactivation blocks the activation of PLC and inhibits the increase in [Ca²⁺]i normally elicited by insulin (Pfeifer et al., 1995). A similar mechanism for the inhibition of IP₃ formation in bovine aortic SMCs has been proposed. It is not known in this model whether inhibition occurs at the level of the G protein or at its interaction with PLC (Hirata et al., 1990). Further, the IP₃ formation induced by both NP and NO that occurs in rat aorta is most likely mediated by PKG (Rapoport, 1986). In summary, an increase in PKG activity likely inhibits IP₃ formation. It is unclear whether this results from direct inhibition of PLC or is secondary to G-protein inhibition. In either case, the decrease of Ca²⁺ released from intracellular stores results in SM relaxation.
cGMP-MEDIATED SMOOTH MUSCLE RELAXATION

Reduction of contractile system Ca²⁺ sensitivity

Under normal conditions, there is a threshold for SMC [Ca²⁺]i above which a contraction is triggered. cGMP reduces the sensitivity of the contractile system to Ca²⁺, such that a contraction is not triggered even by suprathreshold levels of [Ca²⁺]i. In swine carotid SMCs, cGMP relaxes KCl-induced contractions without changing [Ca²⁺]i. This suggests that the sensitivity of the contractile system to Ca²⁺ is affected (Chen and Rembold, 1992). The mechanism of the cGMP-induced Ca²⁺ desensitization is unknown, although several theories have been proposed. The diverse molecular events related with this cGMP effect are described below.

Stimulation of myosin light chain phosphatase activity. The contractile state of SM is primarily dependent on the level of myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation, which is regulated by the balance between myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) and myosin light chain phosphatase (MLCP) activity. Inhibition of MLCP could produce contraction in the absence of increased [Ca²⁺]i (i.e., increased sensitivity to Ca²⁺). Alternatively, an increase in MLCP activity could produce relaxation by decreasing MLC phosphorylation without changing [Ca²⁺]i (i.e., reduced Ca²⁺ sensitivity) (Wu et al., 1996; Lee et al., 1997).

Studies using isolated ilial (Wu et al., 1996) and arterial (Lee et al., 1997) SMCs from the rabbit demonstrate that the cGMP-PKG pathway induces an increase in MLCP activity without affecting MLCK activity. This shift in the MLCK/MLCP equilibrium results in a net decrease in MLC phosphorylation and, thus, a reduction in the sensitivity of the contractile system to Ca²⁺, which relaxes SM (Wu et al., 1996; Lee et al., 1997). PGK may increase MLCP activity either by phosphorylation of the M110 regulatory subunit of the MLCP, causing activation, or by phosphorylation and inactivation of a MLCP inhibitory protein (Wu et al., 1996).

PKG reportedly phosphorylates an MLCP inhibitor (PPI) in the same manner as PKA, at the threonine 35 position at a consensus PKG phosphorylation site. But instead of reducing Ca²⁺ sensitivity, PKG phosphorylation increases PPI activity, thus reducing MLCP activity and increasing contractile system Ca²⁺ sensitivity (Tokui et al., 1996).

The mechanism for a PKG-induced reduction in the contractile system's sensitivity to Ca²⁺ by altering the balance of MLC phosphorylation must be further clarified. cGMP did not affect MLCK activity in studies of swine carotid arteries. The main challenge is to elucidate the mechanism by which cGMP alters MLCP and how this mechanism modulates SM activity in vivo (Van Riper et al., 1997).

Inhibition of protein kinase C activity. Protein kinase C (PKC) belongs to a multigene family containing at least 12 isoenzymes with multiple intracellular, target proteins (Kumar et al., 1997). PKC is usually activated by diacylglycerol (DAG), although some isoforms are DAG independent. The activation of PKC results in a wide variety of cellular effects, depending on the isoform expressed (Kumar et al., 1997). This likely explains why there is no consensus on the role of PKC in smooth muscle contraction (Horowitz et al., 1996).

It has been shown that PKC activation can increase Ca²⁺ sensitivity, although the molecular events involved are not yet fully established (Ruegg, 1999). PKC may directly or indirectly phosphorylate caldesmon (Vorotnikov et al., 1994; Walsh et al., 1994), a regulatory protein that in its nonphosphorylated state inhibits the actin-myosin interaction. PKC may also affect the Ca²⁺ sensitivity via a MLCP inhibition (Kitazawa et al., 1999). It is logical to postulate that PKC inhibition will decrease Ca²⁺ sensitivity in those SM in which activation of PKC leads to enhancement of smooth muscle contraction.

In cultured rat aortic smooth muscle cells, ANP inhibits PKC activation induced by angiotensin II and endothelin 1 via a cGMP-PKG-dependent mechanism. This supports a role for PKC inhibition as part of the decrease in Ca²⁺ sensitivity induced by cGMP (Kumar et al., 1997), especially in those muscles in which PKC plays a role in SM contraction. In fact, in vitro studies of human myometrial strips suggest that PKC activation is required for oxytocin-induced myometrial contractions (Morrison et al., 1996).

Phosphorylation of a small heat shock-related protein. The heat shock proteins (HSPs) are a large family, whose expression is usually induced by cellular stress. However, some HSPs are constitutively expressed, suggesting a role in normal cellular behavior. The αβ-crystalline, HSP27 and HSP20 are the “small HSPs” and share sequence homology (Beall et al., 1997). HSP20 is expressed in many cell types, but is found at high levels only in skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscles. Interestingly, the expression of HSP20 does not increase after heat shock in rat skeletal muscle (Beall et al., 1997).

The precise function of the small HSPs is unknown. It has been proposed that they are important regulatory components of the actin-based cytoskeleton and may participate in assembly, disassembly, stabilization, and internal transport of intracellular proteins. In bovine carotid artery, SM HSP20 is an actin-associated protein. HSP20 may have a role in SM relaxation through its interaction with the contractile filaments (Brophy et al., 1999). Here, flow-induced endothelium-dependent relaxation (probably by NO release) is associated with an increase in the phosphorylation state of HSP20 (Jerius et al., 1999). It has also been shown that HSP27 is related with the contractile process and may be the mediator of PKC-induced Ca²⁺ sensitization (Ibitayo et al., 1999).

PKG activated by cGMP induces SM relaxation in bovine carotid SMCs. There is a correlation between cGMP-induced relaxation and an increase in the phosphorylation of two 20-kDa proteins named pp3 and pp8. These proteins are structurally related and identical to HSP20, suggesting they are different, phosphorylated forms of the same protein (Beall et al., 1997, 1999; Woodrum et al., 1999). The amino acid sequence of the proteins has a consensus site for PKG or PKA phosphorylation coincident with the demonstrated capability of PKG to phosphorylate HSP20 in vitro (Beall et al., 1997).

The possible role of HSP20 phosphorylation in mediating cGMP-induced smooth muscle relaxation is further supported by the observation that cGMP does not increase the phosphorylated level of HSP20 in human

PKG pathway is involved in the control of intracellular Ca²⁺ concentration induced by isoproterenol or forskolin in bovine tracheal SM (Felbel et al., 1988).

Isoproterenol increases the cAMP concentration in vascular SM of pig coronary arteries, causing relaxation by the activation of PKG, but not the activation of PKA (Jiang et al., 1992). In pig coronary arteries, the relaxing capacities of various cyclic nucleotide analogues strongly correlate with their EC₅₀ values for PKG, but not PKA (Francis et al., 1988). Similar results were reported for rat aortic SMCs, in which the ability of isoproterenol or forskolin to reduce [Ca²⁺]i and to inhibit the vasopressin-stimulated [Ca²⁺]i increase was mediated by the cAMP-PKG pathway, and not by the cAMP-PKA pathway (Lincoln et al., 1990).

cAMP binds with high affinity to one of the two PKG binding sites. Autophosphorylation of PKG, an event that occurs following cGMP or cAMP binding, increases the affinity of PKG for cAMP. These data support the hypothesis that cAMP is involved in SM relaxation through its interaction with PKG (Landgraf et al., 1986).

Based on the above-noted observations, we believe it likely that intracellular second-messenger cross talk plays an important role in SM relaxation. It is also possible that in some physiological events, cAMP exerts its relaxing effects through the activation of both kinases, although the evidence shows that cAMP interacts with PKG more than was previously suspected (Fig. 3). However, the evidence for this hypothesis is not unanimous. In genetically engineered mice in which the PKG I gene has been inactivated, there is complete abolition of the cGMP-relaxing effect coexisting with conserved response to cAMP (Pfeifer et al., 1998). Although this observation indicates that PKA can mediate cAMP-induced SM relaxation, it is inadequate to reject the evidence supporting an important role for PKG activation in cAMP cellular actions.

## SECOND-MESSENGER CROSS TALK

It was thought that cAMP and cGMP activate PKA and PKG, respectively, with a high degree of specificity, suggesting the nucleotides have different and sometimes opposite paths of cellular action; however, recent information contradicts this assumption (Ruiz-Velasco et al., 1998). The cyclic nucleotide pathways can interact at several levels: (1) influencing synthesis or degradation of its counterpart; (2) cross-activating protein kinases; and (3) phosphorylating common-target proteins through kinase activation. Although these three potential levels of interaction have been subject to some study, it is unclear whether they have a physiological role (Ruiz-Velasco et al., 1998; Wyatt et al., 1998). We earlier reviewed the interaction at the level of cyclic nucleotide generation. Here we consider cross-talk at the level of kinase activation, since it has been the most extensively studied in SM (Fig. 3).

In colonic cells, cGMP activates PKA to mediate Cl⁻ secretion when stimulated by a heat-stable enterotoxin (Forte et al., 1992). Although there is currently insufficient evidence to apply this model to SMCs (Van Riper et al., 1997), cross-activation of PKA is suggested in a model of rabbit portal vein myocytes (Ruiz-Velasco et al., 1998).

A body of evidence supports a role for cAMP activation of PKG that is believed to account, at least partially, for the relaxing effects of cAMP on SM (Torphy, 1994; Van Riper et al., 1997). In canine and guinea pig airway SM, cAMP can cross-activate PKG, with an effective concentration 50 (EC₅₀), only slightly higher than the EC₅₀ for the activation of PKA, thus confirming a role of the cAMP-PKG pathway in SM relaxation (Torphy et al., 1982; Francis et al., 1988). The cAMP-
presence of a contractile agonist. As a result, cGMP may determine active relaxation of smooth muscle by one or several described mechanisms of Ca²⁺ desensitization. Active relaxation, or the ability to prevent contraction despite the presence of contractile agonists, is a necessary process in several physiological situations such as uterine quiescence essential for a successful pregnancy.

The increase in cGMP content, induced by mediators like NO or NPs, is related to SM relaxation in physiological processes, such as vascular endothelial-dependent vasodilatation and uterine quiescence during the pregnancy. There is less evidence to sustain a role for cAMP-mediated SM relaxation in physiological processes. Yet, most of our current tools for the pharmacological management of disease related to pathological SM contraction rely on drugs that activate the adenylate cyclase-cAMP pathway. For example, bronchodilation and the treatment of preterm labor are based on β-adrenergic drugs. The relaxation produced by these drugs, which act to increase the intracellular cAMP content, may indeed be mediated by cross-activation of PKG, instead of the primary activation of PKA. If true, this would necessitate a degree of pharmacological inefficiency. We suggest that focusing on guanylate cyclase activators to induce SM relaxation via the cGMP-PKG pathway activation may enhance efficacy.

Since most of the research in this field has been done in vascular SM, some extrapolations and generalizations are necessary to extend the concepts to other types of SM. We cannot be certain that all of the described mechanisms are functional in every muscle. The mechanisms primarily used in each muscle type to control SM tone must be clarified. Additionally, further investigation is necessary to elucidate the exact role of cGMP and PKG in the control of SM contractile activity in humans. Improving our understanding of the role that cGMP plays in the regulation of SM contraction/relaxation should be a priority in medical research. The results of such investigations could lead to improved clinical management of many diseases, whose etiologies are related to aberrant control of SM contractile activity.
