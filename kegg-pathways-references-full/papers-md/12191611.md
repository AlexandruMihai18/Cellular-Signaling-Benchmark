## Abstract

Regulation of cellular functions and responses utilizes a number of the signal transduction pathways. Each pathway should transduce signals with high efficiency and fidelity to avoid unnecessary crosstalks. The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades regulate a wide variety of cellular functions, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and stress responses. MAPK is activated by MAPK kinase; phosphorylates various targets, including transcription factors and MAPK-activated protein kinases; and is inactivated by several phosphatases. Recent studies have provided a cue to understand the molecular mechanism underlying the signal transduction through the MAPK cascades. In the MAPK cascades, docking interactions, which are achieved through a site outside the catalytic domain of MAPKs, regulate the efficiency and specificity of the enzymatic reactions. The docking interaction is different from a transient enzyme-substrate interaction through the active center. It has been shown that activators, substrates, and inactivators of MAPKs utilize a common site on MAPKs in the docking interaction. Then, the docking interaction may regulate not only the efficiency and specificity of the cascades, but also the ordered and integrated signaling. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

to play important roles in a variety of cellular responses, such as cell proliferation, cell differentiation, apoptosis, etc. To regulate the cellular responses, the timing of the activation and inactivation of MAPKs should be strictly controlled. There are three major subgroups in the MAPK family: extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), p38 MAPK, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)/stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK). ERK is activated mainly by mitogenic stimuli, whereas p38 MAPK and JNK/SAPK are activated mainly by stress stimuli or inflammatory cytokines. MAPKs are phosphorylated and activated by specific activator MAPK kinases (MAPKKs); phosphorylate various targets, such as MAPK-activated protein kinases (MAPKAPKs) and transcription factors; and are inactivated by specific phosphatases (Sturgill & Wu, 1991; Ahn et al., 1992; Nishida & Gotoh, 1993; Marshall, 1995; Kyriakis & Avruch, 1996; Treisman, 1996; Robinson & Cobb, 1997; Ip & Davis, 1998; Schaeffer & Weber, 1999). Each MAPK has specific activators (MAPKKs), substrates (MAPKAPKs and transcription factors), and inactivators (phosphatases) (Fig. 1). The signal is transduced in the form of a phosphorylation event from an upstream kinase to a downstream molecule. The kinase and phosphatase reactions must be efficient and specific to avoid unnecessary crosstalks among the MAPK cascades or with other signaling pathways. The molecular basis for regulating the efficiency and the fidelity

of these reactions, however, has been poorly understood. It recently has been reported that MAPKs are able to bind to cognate MAPKKs, MAPKAPKs, and specific phosphatases, and that there is a good correlation between the binding specificity and the enzymatic specificity. Such binding is not achieved by a transient enzyme-substrate interaction through the active center. This binding is called the docking interaction. The docking interaction has been shown to regulate the efficiency of the enzymatic reaction, the enzymatic specificity, and subcellular localization of both the enzyme and substrate.

2. Docking sites on mitogen-activated protein kinase-interacting molecules

A large number of molecules have been shown to constitute the MAPK cascades. There are four subgroups in the MAPK family. Seven members of MAPKK, 10 members of MAPKAPK, and 10 members of MAPK phosphatase (MKP) have been reported. Each MAPK has specific MAPKKs, MAPKAPKs, and MKPs. It has become apparent that MAPKs form complexes with their MAPKKs, MAPKAPKs, transcription factors, and phosphatases, and that these interactions are important for regulating the specificity of these enzymatic reactions (Bardwell & Thorner, 1996; Kallunki

with JNK1 (Xia & Karin, 1998). A C-terminal portion of 90-kDa ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK)1 and -2, members of MAPKAPKs, is identified as an ERK2 docking site (Gavin & Nebreda, 1999; Smith et al., 1999). An N-terminal portion of PTP-SL (a tyrosine phosphatase specific for ERK and p38) was shown to be a MAPK docking site (Pulido et al., 1998; Zuniga et al., 1999). By examining the primary sequence, we have found that all the known members of the MAPKK and the MAPKAPK families have a putative or identified MAPK docking site, which is characterized by a cluster of positively charged amino acids surrounded by hydrophobic amino acids outside the catalytic domain (Tanoue et al., 2000; see Figs. 2 and 3). We have also found such a positively charged amino acid cluster in common in sequences of dual specificity MKPs in the regulatory domain outside the catalytic phosphatase domain, which might serve as a docking site for MAPKs. The mutations introduced in the docking site sequences disrupted the binding between the MAPK-interacting molecules and MAPKs. For example, replacement of the two lysine residues in the docking site of MEK1 by methionines completely disrupted the binding between MEK1 and ERK2. When the cluster of arginine residues in the N-terminal portion of MKP-5, a member of dual specificity MKPs acting on p38 and JNK (Tanoue et al., 1999), was replaced by methionines, the binding between MKP-5 and p38 was completely lost. Furthermore, disruption of the docking interaction greatly decreased the efficiency of the action of the MAPK-interacting molecules on MAPKs, and vice versa. For example, a docking-deficient form of MKP-3, a member of dual specificity MKP acting on ERK (Muda et al., 1996), inactivated ERK2 much less efficiently than did wild-type MKP-3. A docking-deficient form of MAPK-interacting kinase (MNK)1, a member of MAPKAPK specific for ERK and p38 (Fukunaga & Hunter, 1997; Waskiewicz et al., 1997), was phosphorylated by ERK2 and p38 much less efficiently than was wild-type MNK1. The docking site of MAPK-interacting molecules is featured by a cluster of positively charged

amino acids and surrounding hydrophobic amino acids (Tanoue et al., 2000). Both the charged amino acids and the hydrophobic amino acids have been shown to be important for the docking interaction (Xu et al., 2001; Zhou et al., 2001).

(2001) reported that replacement of the ERK docking site of p90RSK by the p38 docking site of MAPKAPK-2 converts p90RSK into p38-activated kinase. This may be an example in which the docking site alone determines both the binding specificity and the enzymatic specificity. For MAPKKs and MKPs, no such studies were reported. Based on the examination of the docking specificity of MKPs and the sequence characteristics of their docking sites, we propose that MKPs can be categorized into three groups (Tanoue et al., 2001b). The first group includes CL100/MKP-1, MKP-2, and phosphatase of activated cell (PAC)-1; the second group includes MKP-3, MKP-4, Pyst-2, and B23; and the third group includes MKP-5, MKP-7, and hVH5 (Fig. 4). The consensus sequence of the MAPK docking site of each group is XXRRRAK/R for the first group, XXXRRYR/K(Q)R/K(G) for the second group, and XK/RRRLQQYK for the third group (where X is a hydrophobic residue and Y is any residue except K or R). MKPs acting on p38 MAPK (the first and third groups) have three consecutive positively charged amino acids in the MAPK docking site, while in the second group, MKPs acting mainly on ERK have two. It previously has been shown that MAPKAPKs being activated by p38 also have more consecutive positively charged amino acids in the MAPK docking site than those activated by ERK (Gavin & Nebreda, 1999; Smith et al., 1999; Tanoue et al., 2000). Thus, the number of charged amino acids in the MAPK docking site of MKPs might be important for docking specificity and, therefore, the efficiency of the catalytic activity of MKPs. Not only the MAPK docking sites, but also other regions, show a high degree of sequence similarity within each group of MKPs. Thus, each group has its own substrate specificity. However, the published results are not necessarily in complete agreement with this tentative classification of the substrate specificity of MKPs. Chu et al. (1996) reported that while PAC-1 could inactivate JNK/SAPK in COS7 cells, it could not act efficiently on JNK/SAPK in NIH3T3 or HeLa cells. Such a difference might be caused by the difference in the expression level of MKPs in each experiment. CL100/MKP-1 had been thought to be specific for ERK, but recent studies suggest that it is specific for p38 and JNK/SAPK, rather than ERK (Camps et al., 2000). Our results also showed that CL100/MKP-1 binds strongly to p38 and JNK/

and the inactivator MKP-3 bind to the same site on ERK2, we call this site a common docking (CD) domain (Tanoue et al., 2000).

5. The common docking domain is indispensable for efficient enzymatic reactions

We examined the effect of disruption of the CD domain on these enzymatic reactions (Tanoue et al., 2000). A docking-deficient mutant of ERK2 (D316,319N) was less efficiently phosphorylated and activated by wild-type MEK1 in vitro and in cells. The ability of both the ERK2 D319N (corresponding to the sevenmaker mutant) and the ERK2 D316,319N to phosphorylate MNK1 was markedly decreased, as compared with wild-type ERK2. Furthermore, ERK2 (D319N) was much less sensitive than wild-type ERK2 to inactivation by wild-type MKP-3. Taken together, these results show clearly that the docking interactions increase the efficiency of these enzymatic reactions.

6. The common docking domain is conserved among the mitogen-activated protein kinase family

An alignment of the sequences corresponding to the CD domain of ERK2 reveals a conserved aspartic acid (corresponding to Asp321 for Xenopus ERK2 and Asp316 for rat ERK2) just after the kinase domain in the C-terminal region of all the members of the MAPK family (Fig. 6). The sequences around this aspartic acid show similarity to one another: for example, the existence of acidic amino acids in the C-terminal side. Some of the acidic amino acids, including the conserved aspartic acid, appear to be exposed to the surface of the molecule and close to one another in the steric structure, as deduced from the crystal structure of p38α and JNK3 (Wilson et al., 1996; Wang et al., 1997; Xie et al., 1998). For example, in the case of p38α, three acidic amino acid residues (Asp313, Asp315, and Asp316) are close to one another on the surface of the molecule. Thus, it is possible that this region may serve as a docking site on p38 and JNK, like the CD domain on ERK2. We then tested this possibility. While wild-type p38 bound to MKK6, a direct activator for p38 (Moriguchi et al., 1996), wild-type MKP-5, a member of dual specificity MKPs acting on p38 and JNK (Tanoue et al., 1999), and wild-type MNK1, a member of MAPKAPKs (Fukunaga & Hunter, 1997; Was-kiewicz et al., 1997), a mutant p38 in which the above three aspartic acids were replaced by asparagines, did not bind to any of them. The mutation at two aspartic acids, instead of the three in p38, induced a less severe, but significant, defect in the binding ability, indicating the importance of the three acidic amino acids in the docking. As for JNK, while wild-type JNK2 bound to wild-type SEK1/MKK4, a direct activator for JNK, and wild-type MKP-5, a mutant JNK2 in which Asp326 was replaced by Asn, did not. The mutant MKP-5 showed a decreased ability to bind to wild-type

JNK2. These results suggest that p38 and JNK also have a CD domain.

Disruption of the docking interaction greatly decreased the efficiency of the action of MKP-5 on p38. The docking-deficient MKP-5 inactivated p38 much less efficiently than did wild-type MKP-5, and the docking-deficient p38 was much less efficiently inactivated by wild-type MKP-5 than was wild-type p38. The docking-deficient MNK1 was activated to a much lesser extent than wild-type MNK1 in response to osmotic stress. Therefore, the docking interactions increase the efficiency of these enzymatic reactions.

7. Molecular determinants on mitogen-activated protein kinases for docking specificity

The docking interactions increase the efficiency of all the enzymatic reactions, and may help to regulate the specificity of molecular recognition. However, the following results suggest that the docking specificity may not be determined solely by the CD domain (Tanoue et al., 2000). First, a mutation of Ser323 (Ser318 for rat ERK2, see Fig. 6) to Asp (DPSD—DPDD) in the CD domain of ERK2, which gave a sequence of the CD domain of p38, did not alter the docking specificity of ERK2. This mutant ERK2 bound to MEK1, but not to MKK6. Second, the docking interactions of p38 with MKK6, MKP-5, and MNK1 were also inhibited by the wild-type MEK1 peptide (residues 1–15), although the inhibition efficiency was low, as compared with the case of ERK2. We have identified a novel site on MAPKs, near the CD domain in the steric structure, that determines the docking specificity towards MAPKAPKs (Tanoue et al., 2001a). Remarkably, an exchange of only two amino acids in this site of p38 and ERK (Glu160 and Asp161 in p38 and Thr157 and Thr158 in ERK2) converts the docking specificity. We named this site the ED site. The ED site is also located on the opposite side from the active center, and is utilized differently for docking interactions with each interacting molecule. The ED site is needed for the docking interactions of p38 with several MAPKAPKs. When two amino acid residues of ERK2, Thr157 and Thr158, were replaced by Glu and Asp, respectively, ERK2 bound to 3pk and mitogen-and stress-activated kinase (MSK)2, indicating that the exchange of the amino acids in the ED site converts the docking specificity of ERK2 to that of the p38 type. However, the reverse exchange in p38 did not convert the docking specificity of p38 toward RSK2 from the p38 type to the ERK2 type. This implies that the other amino acid residues also participate in the docking interaction. The amino acids comprising the CD domain and the ED site form a groove-like structure in the steric structure of p38 and ERK2 (Fig. 5B). Thus, we propose a concept of a docking groove. The structural difference in the docking groove between p38 and ERK2 might affect both the docking affinity and the docking specificity. Each amino acid residue in the docking groove appears to contribute
differently to each docking interaction. In agreement with this idea, although the CD domain is important for all the docking interactions between MAPKs and MAPKAPKs examined in this study, the ED site is differentially involved in each interaction. For example, while the mutation at the ED site of p38 (Glu160 and Asp161 were replaced by threonines) weakened its docking interaction with p38-regulated/activated protein kinase (PRAK), the same mutation strengthened the docking interaction with MSK1. Not only the ED site, but also the CD domain, is important for regulating the docking specificity of p38 and ERK2. For example, ERK2 SD, in which the CD domain of ERK2 was converted to that of p38, was able to bind to 3pk, like p38, while wild-type ERK2 was unable to bind to 3pk. Also, the conversion of both the CD domain and the ED (TT) site of ERK2 to those of p38 converted the docking specificity of ERK2 towards MSK2 to that of p38. Moreover, it is likely that other amino acids near the CD domain and the ED site within the docking groove are also involved in the docking interactions. The difference in the amino acid composition and sequence of the MAPK docking sites of the MAPK-interacting molecules (MAPKKs, MKPs, and MAPKAPKs) might affect the specificity and the affinity of their docking interactions with the docking groove of MAPKs. It should be noted that MAPKAPKs and MKPs acting on p38 have more consecutive positively charged amino acids in the MAPK docking site than those acting on ERK. Correspondingly, there are more negatively charged amino acids in the docking groove of p38α than in that of ERK2.

### 8. The sevenmaker mutant

Asp319 (in rat ERK2) in the CD domain is mutated to Asn in the sevenmaker mutant of *Drosophila* ERK/Rolled (Brunner et al., 1994) (see Fig. 5B). The sevenmaker mutant shows a gain of function phenotype in *Drosophila*. The phenotype may depend on the balance of the intracellular amounts of activators, inactivators, and substrates of ERK2, and the properties of the enzymatic reactions. While there exist only two activators of ERK2, MEK1 and MEK2, there are many inactivators of ERK2 (tyrosine phosphatases and dual specificity phosphatases) (Camps et al., 2000; Keyse, 2000). Furthermore, there exists a number of phosphatases whose catalytic activity is enhanced (up to 35-fold for MKP-3) by binding to ERK2 (Camps et al., 1998). Thus, the inactivation of ERK2 might be more severely impaired than the activation of ERK2 in the partial disruption of the CD domain. It should be noted that the docking interactions are not completely disrupted in the sevenmaker mutant of ERK/Rolled because only one of the two aspartic acids of the CD domain is replaced by Asn. However, our result also shows the decreased ability of the sevenmaker ERK2 to phosphorylate MNK1 in vitro. This result is apparently contradictory to the gain of function phenotype of the sevenmaker mutant. It should be taken into consideration

that there are many parameters affecting ERK2 activity in vivo. The overall balance of the activity of the interacting molecules may define the final efficiency of the signal transduction. Thus, a complete understanding of the sevenmaker phenotype requires much more thorough quantitative analyses. It recently has been reported that a mutation of Asp160 (in rat ERK2) to Asn leads to a phenotype similar to that of the sevenmaker mutant (Lim et al., 1999), suggesting involvement of Asp160 in the docking interaction. Asp160 is located adjacent to Thr158 of the ED (TT) site in the steric structure of ERK2 (Fig. 5B). The corresponding amino acid in p38 is Glu163. It is clear that both Asp160 of ERK2 and Glu163 of p38 are located within the docking groove, and are expected to be exposed to the surface of the molecules. Therefore, this recent observation is consistent with our idea of the docking groove.

### 9. Conclusions

The recent advance in the understanding of determinants for the efficiency and fidelity of signal transduction is the finding of the domains for protein-protein interactions, such as Src homology (SH)2, SH3, PDZ, etc. (Pawson, 1995; Hunter, 2000; Pawson & Nash, 2000). Each protein recognizes and interacts with specific partners through these domains with various efficiencies. These domains often form modular structures, and the amino acid composition and sequence of the domains determine the specificity of the interactions.

MAPK forms a globular structure without distinct domain structures beside a kinase domain. However, recent biochemical studies showed that MAPK has a surface (docking groove) for docking with MAPK-interacting molecules, which regulates the docking specificity and enzymatic specificity.

The docking groove is located on the opposite side of the active center in the steric structure. Thus, the docking interaction is different from the transient enzyme-substrate interaction that is achieved through the active center. It has been shown that several enzymes need a co-factor(s) or a specific interaction sequence of their own for the efficient and specific enzymatic reaction. For example, PP2A requires specific co-factors or subunits to recognize each substrate (Millward et al., 1999), and PDK1 has a hydrophobic docking pocket for the interaction with its substrates protein kinase A, protein kinase Cζ, and protein kinase C-related kinase 2 (Ricardo et al., 2000; Balendran et al., 2000; Biondi et al., 2001). However, it is not known whether such interactions besides the transient enzyme-substrate interaction through the active center are always necessary for kinase-substrate recognitions. Interestingly, other substrates of MAPKs, such as transcription factors, phosphodiesterase, and son of sevenless, also are shown to have the docking site for MAPKs (Kallunki et al., 1996; Yang et al., 1998, 1999; Jacobs et al., 1999; unpublished
docking site of several MAPKAPKs overlaps with their NLS sequence. We have shown that the docking interaction with p38 regulates the subcellular localization of 3pk, a member of MAPKAPKs (Tanoue et al., 2001a).
