The bis(glutathionyl)spermidine trypanothione exclusively occurs in parasitic protozoa of the order Kinetoplastida, such as trypanosomes and leishmania, some of which are the causative agents of several tropical diseases. The dithiol is kept reduced by the flavoenzyme trypanothione reductase and the trypanothione system replaces in these parasites the nearly ubiquitous glutathione/glutathione reductase couple. Trypanothione is a reductant of thioredoxin and tryparedoxin, small dithiol proteins, which in turn deliver reducing equivalents for the synthesis of deoxyribonucleotides as well as for the detoxification of hydroperoxides by different peroxidases. Depending on the individual organism and the developmental state, the parasites also contain significant amounts of glutathione, mono-glutathionylspermidine and ovothiol, whereby all four low molecular mass thiols are directly (trypanothione and mono-glutathionylspermidine) or indirectly (glutathione and ovothiol) maintained in the reduced state by trypanothione reductase. Thus the trypanothione system is central for any thiol regeneration and trypanothione reductase has been shown to be an essential enzyme in these parasites. The absence of this pathway from the mammalian host and the sensitivity of trypanosomatids toward oxidative stress render the enzymes of the trypanothione metabolism attractive target molecules for the rational development of new drugs against African sleeping sickness, Chagas’ disease and the different forms of leishmaniasis.

Key words: Ascorbate/Ovothiol/Peroxiredoxin/Thiol metabolism/Trypanosoma/Trypanothione.

## Introduction

Trypanosomes and leishmania are parasitic protozoa, to which belong the causative agents of African sleeping sickness (*Trypanosoma brucei gambiense* and *T. b. rhodesiense*), Nagana cattle disease (*T. congolense*, *T. b.*

brucei), South-American Chagas’ disease (*T. cruzi*), and the different forms of leishmaniasis. Trypanosomatids differ from all other known eukaryotes and prokaryotes in their specific redox system, which is based on the thiol-polyamine conjugate trypanothione [N¹,N⁸-bis(glutathionyl)spermidine] (Fairlamb et al., 1985; Figure 1) and the NADPH-dependent flavoenzyme trypanothione reductase (TR). The trypanothione system replaces in these parasites the nearly ubiquitous glutathione/glutathione reductase (GR) system. So far, TR has been characterised in the insect parasite *Crithidia fasciculata* (Shames et al., 1986), in *T. cruzi* (Krauth-Siegel et al., 1987; Sullivan and Walsh, 1991), *T. congolense* (Sullivan et al., 1989), *T. brucei* (Aboagye-Kwarteng et al., 1992), *Leishmania donovani* (Cunningham and Fairlamb, 1995) and *L. major* (GenBank accession no. AL354513). Montrichard et al. (1999) described the occurrence of both, GR and TR, in *Euglena gracilis*, a phytoflagellated protozoan belonging to the euglenoid subphylum of Euglenozoa. It was the first report on trypanothione reductase in a non-trypanosomatid organism. In addition, *E. gracilis* is the only known species that contains both disulfide reductases. The localisation of the enzymes has not yet been determined. Since *Euglena* possesses a chloroplast, one may speculate that the two reductases reside in different cellular compartments. Recently, a partial gene sequence from *Entamoeba histolytica* has been deposited (GenBank acc. no. AF503571) which shows 68% identity with *T. cruzi* TR.

# Biosynthesis of Trypanothione

The biosynthesis of trypanothione can be subdivided into three parts (Figure 2). Firstly, glutathione and spermidine are generated as in other organisms and are then combined to form trypanothione. The synthesis of glutathione (GSH) starts with the formation of γ-glutamylcysteine from L-glutamate and L-cysteine. The ATP-dependent reaction is catalysed by γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase (GCS) which is the rate limiting enzyme in the synthesis of GSH in mammalian cells and of trypanothione in *L. tarantolae* (Grondin et al., 1997). *T. brucei* GCS is encoded by a single copy gene (Lueder and Phillips, 1996). The enzyme is feedback-inhibited by GSH and is inactivated by cysteamine and buthionine sulfoximine (BSO). The kinetic properties of recombinant *T. brucei* GCS suggest that the substrate binding pocket and the mechanism of enzyme regulation differ from the mammalian enzyme, providing evidence that *T. brucei* GCS could be a selective target for antitrypanosomal drug development (Lueder and Phillips, 1996). γ-Glutamylcysteine reacts with L-glycine to yield GSH. Glutathione synthetase (GS), the enzyme catalysing this reaction, has not yet been characterised in any trypanosomatid organism, but a possible glutathione synthetase gene is located on chromosome 14 of *L. major*. Recent gene expression studies in leishmania showed that the GS gene is one of several genes which are upregulated in drug-resistant mutants (Guimond et al., 2002, Abstract 225 B; XIIIth Molecular Parasitology Meeting, Woods Hole, USA).

There is no uniform mechanism for the production of spermidine in the different trypanosomatids. *T. cruzi* epimastigotes are unable to synthesise relevant amounts of putrescine and cadaverine de novo but take up polyamines from the medium (Hunter et al., 1994; Ariyanayagam and Fairlamb, 1997). After conversion into spermidine and aminopropylcadaverine, these exogenous polyamines are used to generate trypanothione and N¹,N⁹-bis(glutathionyl)aminopropylcadaverine (homotrypanothione) (Hunter et al., 1994). In contrast, African trypanosomes and leishmania synthesize their own spermidine. The first step is the decarboxylation of ornithine by ornithine decarboxylase (ODC). Putrescine formed in this reaction is then the substrate of spermidine synthase. The reaction requires decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine, which is provided by S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase.

Originally, a single polypeptide has been described in *C. fasciculata* that converts GSH and spermidine into trypanothione (Henderson et al., 1990). Later two distinct ATP-dependent enzymes were identified, namely glutathionylspermidine synthetase (GspS) that conjugates GSH and spermidine to N¹- or N⁸-glutathionylspermidine and trypanothione synthetase (TS) that catalyses the addition of a second GSH molecule to generate trypanothione (Smith et al., 1992; Koenig et al., 1997). The recent functional analysis of recombinant GspS has clarified some of the conflicting results obtained earlier with the proteins isolated from *C. fasciculata* (Oza et al., 2002a). Interestingly, in *T. cruzi* trypanothione is synthesised by a single polypeptide that catalyses both consecutive steps (Oza et al., 2002b). *C. fasciculata* GspS and *T. cruzi* TS have slow amidase activities, hydrolysing glutathionylspermidine and trypanothione to spermidine and glutathione. The physiological relevance of this reaction is not known but one function may be the regulation of the spermidine level in the parasites.

A linkage between glutathione (GSH) and spermidine metabolism was first observed in *E. coli* (Tabor and Tabor, 1975). Glutathionylspermidine is formed in all growth stages of *E. coli*, but a rapid turnover leads to a low steady-state level in logarithmically growing cells. In contrast, during stationary phase, all of the intracellular spermidine and a large part of glutathione occur as glutathionylspermidine conjugate. *E. coli* from any stage contain a glutathionylspermidine synthetase but the bacterium does not form trypanothione. *E. coli* glutathionylspermidine synthetase is a bifunctional syn-

thetase/amidase also catalysing the hydrolysis of the glutathionylspermidine amide bond (Bollinger et al., 1995). Both activities reside in separate domains of the protein (Kwon et al., 1997; Lin et al., 1997).

### Comparison of Trypanothione and Glutathione

Trypanothione is much more reactive than glutathione. As outlined below, trypanothione can undergo spontaneous reactions which do not at all occur with glutathione, such as the direct reduction of ribonucleotide reductase (Dormeyer et al., 2001), or which are orders of magnitude slower with glutathione like the reduction of dehydroascorbate (Krauth-Siegel and Lüdemann, 1996; Figure 3). Depending on the developmental stage and the individual trypanosomatid, the parasites also contain glutathione and ovothiol A (N¹-methyl-4-mercaptohistidine) which are both kept reduced by the spontaneous reaction with trypanothione (Figure 3; Steenkamp, 2002a; Ariyanayagam and Fairlamb, 2001). The thiol-disulfide exchange between glutathione disulfide and trypanothione can be catalysed by P52, a *T. cruzi* enzyme that also has low glutathione-dependent thiol transferase and dehydroascorbate reductase activity (see below) (Moutiez et al., 1997).

The distinct reactivities of trypanothione and glutathione are not due to their redox potentials, which are quite similar (Table 1). One crucial difference is that trypanothione as a dithiol is kinetically favoured as a reductant of disulfides (Gilbert, 1990). A second striking difference are the cysteine pK values. Trypanothione has a pK value of 7.4 (Moutiez et al., 1994), probably due to the presence of the positively charged nitrogen in the spermidine bridge, whereas the pK value of glutathione is more than one pH unit higher. The pK value of trypanothione coincides with the intracellular pH value of the parasite (Fraser-L’Hostis et al., 1997) which certainly contributes to its reactivity. The second order rate constants for thiol-disulfide exchange reactions exhibit an optimum when the thiol pK value is equal to the pH value of the solution (Gilbert, 1990). Thus, both the dithiol character and the thiol pK value are probably responsible for the unique properties of trypanothione.

### Reduction of Dehydroascorbate by Trypanothione

Ascorbic acid is a powerful antioxidant and radical scavenger (Halliwell, 2001). Dehydroascorbate formed in these reactions must be converted back to ascorbic acid, which in nearly all organisms is achieved by glutathione either directly or catalysed by thioltransferases (glutaredoxin) (Washburn and Wells, 1999). The presence of ascorbate in trypanosomes has clearly been demonstrated and a glutathione-dependent dehydroascorbate reductase activity has been reported in *T. cruzi* epimastigotes and trypomastigotes (Clark et al., 1994). P52, a trypanothione:glutathione disulfide thiolttransferase in *T. cruzi*, shows also low glutathione-dehydroascorbate reductase activity, the catalytic efficiency being on the same order of magnitude as that of porcine glutaredoxin (Moutiez et al., 1997). On the other hand, trypanothione is a highly efficient direct reductant of dehydroascorbate.

### Fig. 3 Trypanothione-Dependent Parasite Pathways.

Different disulfides (RSSR) such as glutathione disulfide and the disulfide form of ovothiol A (N¹-methyl-4-mercaptohistidine) are directly reduced by trypanothione to the respective thiols (RSH). Trypanothione [T(SH)₂] is involved in the detoxification of hydroperoxides, metals and drugs as well as the synthesis of DNA precursors. At millimolar concentrations, the dithiol also spontaneously reduces hydroperoxides as well as ribonucleotide reductase at appreciable rates (see Figure 4). Abbreviations: NDP, nucleoside diphosphate; dNDP, deoxynucleoside diphosphate; Tpx, tryparedoxin; TS₂, trypanothione disulfide.

T(SH)₂ + dehydroascorbate → TS₂ + ascorbate

TS₂ + NADPH + H⁺ → T(SH)₂ + NADP⁺

The dithiol is two to three orders of magnitude more reactive than GSH (Krauth-Siegel and Lüdemann, 1996) and the spontaneous reduction by trypanothione seems to be sufficient for practically all metabolic needs. It is not yet clear to which extent the enzymatic reactions described above contribute to the homeostasis of ascorbate in the parasites (Figure 3). *T. cruzi* possesses in the endoplasmic reticulum a plant-like ascorbate-dependent heme peroxidase which catalyses the reduction of hydrogen peroxide (Wilkinson et al., 2002a). The subsequent regeneration of ascorbate occurs spontaneously at the expense of trypanothione.

## Trypanothione in Metal and Drug Extrusion

Extrusion or sequestration of drug-thiol conjugates is an important mechanism in drug resistance. In leishmania selected for resistance to trivalent arsenite or antimonite, the PGPA (P-glycoprotein-like protein A) gene is frequently amplified (Ouellette et al., 1991; Légaré et al., 1997). PGPA is an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter which has been shown to transport arsenite-glutathione conjugates. It is located in intracellular membranes between the kinetoplast and the flagellar pocket and may sequester conjugated metals in vesicles which could then be exocytosed (Légaré et al., 2001). Since trypanothione forms adducts with arsenite and antimonite in *L. tarentolae* (Mukhopadhyay et al., 1996) it is likely that it is the physiological thiol in conjugates transported by PGPA. Amplification of the PGPA gene in resistant leishmania cell lines is accompanied by an elevated level of trypanothione (Mukhopadhyay et al., 1996; Légaré et al., 1997; Haimeur et al., 2000). The increased level of trypanothione is necessary but not sufficient for metal resistance in leishmania. Obviously a third factor is involved in the process. In mammalian cells selected for arsenite resistance, an increased level of GSH S-transferase is observed (Lo et al., 1992). Although arsenite-thiol conjugates form spontaneously, a homologous trypanothione S-transferase with increased activity has been suggested as the missing step (Légaré et al., 2001). In bloodstream *T. brucei*, overexpression of MRPA (multidrug resistance-associated protein A), which is structurally most closely related to the *L. tarentolae* PGPA, resulted in a 10-fold increase in the IC₅₀ value for the arsenical drug melarsoprol (Shahi et al., 2002). Overexpression of γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase and ornithine decarboxylase, the key enzymes of trypanothione synthesis, only slightly further increased resistance. This may be due to the 20-fold higher basal trypanothione levels in *T. brucei* compared to *L. tarentolae*.

### The Trypanothione/Tryparedoxin Couple

Trypanothione is the direct reductant of tryparedoxin, a thioredoxin-related dithiol protein first described in the insect parasite *C. fasciculata* as trypanothione:peroxiredoxin oxidoreductase (Nogoecke et al., 1997) (Figure 4). Tryparedoxin has a molecular mass of about 16 000 Da and a CPPC redox active motif which clearly distinguishes it from classical thioredoxins (CGPC) and glutaredoxins (CPYC). Tryparedoxins have been detected in all Kinetoplastida studied so far, namely *C. fasciculata* (Nogoecke et al., 1997), *T. brucei* (Lüdemann et al., 1998), *T. cruzi* (Lopez et al., 2000; Wilkinson et al., 2002b) and *L. major* (GenBank acc. no. AL161246). *C. fasciculata* tryparedoxin I and II, *T. brucei* tryparedoxin and *T. cruzi* tryparedoxin I have been functionally characterised. A second putative tryparedoxin gene has been identified in *T. cruzi* (Wilkinson et al., 2002b) which contains large insertions and the function of which is not yet known. As is the case with other members of the thioredoxin family, different isoforms of tryparedoxin occur in the parasites. The two *C. fasciculata* tryparedoxins share 59% identity of all residues (Montemartini et al., 1999). In addition, the tryparedoxin genes can occur in several copies. Whereas in *T. cruzi* tryparedoxin I is encoded by a single copy gene (Wilkinson et al., 2002b), in *T. brucei* at least two tryparedoxin genes exist in close proximity (Reckenfelderbäumer, 2002). In *C. fasciculata*, a minimum of six copies of the tryparedoxin I gene are arranged as tandem repeats (Tetaud and Fairlamb, 1998). The *T. brucei* tryparedoxin gene is transcribed in all developmental stages and

Fig. 4 Flux of Reducing Equivalents from NADPH onto Ribonucleotide Reductase and Peroxidases in Trypanosomatids. A cascade composed of trypanothione reductase, trypanothione [T(SH)₂] and tryparedoxin (Tpx) transfers electrons from NADPH onto ribonucleotide reductase and different peroxidases which then catalyse the reduction of nucleoside diphosphates (NDP) to deoxynucleoside diphosphates (dNDP) and the detoxification of hydroperoxides (ROOH), respectively. At high trypanothione concentrations, both reactions become independent of tryparedoxin. Under these conditions, ribonucleotide reductase as well as hydroperoxides are directly reduced by trypanothione (dashed lines). TS₂, trypanothione disulfide.
also the protein is present in procyclic cells as well as in long slender and short stumpy bloodstream parasites (Reckenfelderbäumer, 2002). Tryparedoxin is a very abundant protein. In *C. fasciculata* grown to late log phase, tryparedoxin I represents at least 5% of the total soluble protein (Nogoceke et al., 1997). In *T. brucei*, the concentration of tryparedoxin was estimated to be ≥100 μM (Reckenfelderbäumer and Krauth-Siegel, 2002).

The trypanothione/tryparedoxin couple is a central component of parasite-specific cascades catalysing the reduction of hydroperoxides as well as the reduction of ribonucleotides (Figures 3 and 4; see below). The $K_{\mathrm{m}}$ values of *C. fasciculata* tryparedoxin I and II for trypanothione are 130 μM (Gomel et al., 1997) and 33 μM (Montemartini et al., 1998), respectively, that of *T. brucei* tryparedoxin is 150 μM (Lüdemann et al., 1998). The reaction mechanism of tryparedoxin is similar to that proposed for thioredoxins. The N-terminal cysteine of the active site dithiol is deprotonated and the nucleophilic thiolate reacts with the respective disulfide substrate to form a mixed disulfide which is subsequently attacked by the C-terminal cysteine releasing the reduced protein product. The reactivity of thioredoxin-type dithiol proteins is determined by the pK value of the nucleophilic cysteine as well as their redox potential (Holmgren, 1985; Ritz and Beckwith, 2001). The pK value of Cys40 of *T. brucei* tryparedoxin is 7.2 (Reckenfelderbäumer and Krauth-Siegel, 2002) which is very similar to that of trypanothione (7.4) and coincides with the cellular pH value of the parasites (Fraser-L'Hostis et al., 1997). This may contribute to the high reactivity of both dithiols in thiol-disulfide exchange reactions. The redox potential of *T. brucei* tryparedoxin is -249 mV, intermediate between those of *E. coli* thioredoxin and glutaredoxin (Table 1).

The crystal structures of *C. fasciculata* tryparedoxin I (Alpey et al., 1999) and II (Hofmann et al., 2001) have been solved. The overall folding is similar to that of thioredoxins but because of the higher molecular mass additional structure elements are found. In accordance with the proposed reaction mechanism, the N-terminal cysteine of the CPCC motif (Cys40 in *C. fasciculata* tryparedoxin I) is exposed to the solvent whereas Cys43 is buried in the protein.

### Trypanothione as Reductant of Thioredoxin

Although thioredoxin reductases have not been identified in any kinetoplastid organism, *T. brucei* possesses a classical thioredoxin (Reckenfelderbäumer et al., 2000). The parasite protein is reduced by human thioredoxin reductase and catalyses typical thioredoxin-mediated reactions such as the reduction of ribonucleotide reductase (Reckenfelderbäumer et al., 2000). There is evidence that regeneration of reduced thioredoxin can occur by the spontaneous reaction with trypanothione. Reduction of insulin disulfide by trypanothione is strongly enhanced

in the presence of *T. brucei* thioredoxin (Schmidt and Krauth-Siegel, unpublished). The cellular concentration of *T. brucei* thioredoxin seems to be very low and its function in the parasites is not clear. Neither gene disruption in bloodstream *T. brucei* nor silencing by RNA interference in procyclic *T. brucei* resulted in phenotypic changes, suggesting that thioredoxin is not essential at least under culture conditions (Schmidt et al., 2002).

#### Trypanothione-Dependent Synthesis of Deoxyribonucleotides

The trypanothione/tryparedoxin couple delivers the reducing equivalents for the parasite synthesis of deoxyribonucleotides (Figure 4). *T. brucei* possesses a typical eukaryotic class I ribonucleotide reductase (Hofer et al., 1997; Dormeyer et al., 1997) with a $K_{\mathrm{m}}$ value for tryparedoxin of 3.7 μM (Dormeyer et al., 2001). At high trypanothione concentrations, the parasite ribonucleotide reductase is directly reduced by the dithiol with a $K_{\mathrm{m}}$ value of 2.1 mM (Dormeyer et al., 2001). Trypanothione is the first example of a physiological non-protein thiol which spontaneously reduces ribonucleotide reductase.

The tryparedoxin-mediated ribonucleotide reductase activity is lowered by more than 60% when 0.1 mM TS₂ is added to an assay containing 1 mM T(SH)₂ (Dormeyer et al., 2001; Figure 5). The regulation of tryparedoxin by the thiol/disulfide ratio of trypanothione may be a control mechanism that links DNA synthesis with the redox state of the cell. The effect is comparable with that observed for the glutathione/glutaredoxin system of *E. coli* (Holmgren, 1979).

![Bar chart](https://example.com/bar-chart.png)

**Fig. 5** Tryparedoxin Is Inhibited by Trypanothione Disulfide. GDP reduction by *T. brucei* ribonucleotide reductase was followed in the presence of 1 mM trypanothione (black columns) as well as 1 mM trypanothione and 10 μM tryparedoxin (grey columns). If any trypanothione disulfide (TS₂) is removed from the reaction by adding 100 μM NADPH and 100 mU trypanothione reductase (TR), the activity of ribonucleotide reductase is highest (columns NADPH/TR), especially in the tryparedoxin-mediated reaction. Addition of increasing TS₂ concentrations to the assay without NADPH and TR leads to a progressive inhibition of the tryparedoxin-dependent activity of ribonucleotide reductase (after Dormeyer et al., 2001).
Trypanothione-Dependent Hydroperoxide Reduction

Trypanosomes tolerate only low levels of hydroperoxides (Boveris et al., 1980) most probably as a consequence of their lack of catalase and selenocysteine-containing glutathione peroxidase. The ability to detoxify low hydrogen peroxide concentrations was first attributed to the spontaneous reduction by trypanothione (Penketh et al., 1987; Carnieri et al., 1993; Figure 4). Later three different classes of peroxidases were characterised in trypanosomatids, whereby in every case trypanothione acts as the electron donor. This is in accordance with the finding that bloodstream *T. brucei* become highly sensitive toward hydrogen peroxide when their trypanothione reductase activity is lowered to 10% of wild-type activity and no exogenous reducing agents are available (Krieger et al., 2000).

The first trypanosomatid peroxidase was purified from *C. fasciculata* and shown to be active in a cascade composed of NADPH, trypanothione reductase, trypanothione, and tryparedoxin (Figure 4; Nogoceke et al., 1997). This tryparedoxin peroxidase is a peroxiredoxin-type enzyme characterised by two active site VCP motifs. Homologous enzymes have been characterised in *L. major* (Levick et al., 1998), *T. cruzi* (Lopez et al., 2000), *T. brucei* (Tetaud et al., 2001), *L. infantum* (Castro et al., 2002) and *L. donovani* (Flohé et al., 2002a). In comparison to classical glutathione peroxidases, the activities of tryparedoxin peroxidases are 2-3 orders of magnitude lower. On the other hand, the cellular concentration of the enzymes is extremely high, being 6% of the total soluble protein in *C. fasciculata* (Nogoceke et al., 1997). The peroxiredoxin-type parasite tryparedoxin peroxidases have a broad substrate specificity and metabolise hydrogen peroxide, *t*-butyl hydroperoxide, linoleic acid hydroperoxide and phosphatidylcholine hydroperoxide (Flohé et al., 2002b).

A second class of peroxidases was first studied in *T. cruzi*. The enzymes are structurally related to glutathione peroxidases but contain cysteine instead of selenocysteine (Wilkinson et al., 2000). Two different isoforms have been characterised, glutathione peroxidase (GPx) I in the cytoplasm and the glycosomes, and GPx II restricted to the endoplasmic reticulum (Wilkinson et al., 2002b,c). Both enzymes show very low activity with glutathione, reducing linoleic acid hydroperoxides and phosphatidylcholine hydroperoxide but not hydrogen peroxide. *T. cruzi* GPx I is also able to detoxify *t*-butyl hydroperoxide and cumene hydroperoxide (Wilkinson et al., 2000). GSSG formed in the reactions is then spontaneously reduced by trypanothione. Recently GPx I was shown to be reduced by a *T. cruzi* tryparedoxin resulting in an 8- to 15-fold increased activity when compared with that in the presence of glutathione (Wilkinson et al., 2002b). In contrast, *T. cruzi* GPx II seems to be glutathione-specific (Wilkinson et al., 2002c).

*T. brucei* has a genomic locus that encodes three homologues of *T. cruzi* GPx I (Hillebrand et al., 2003). The deduced protein sequences are almost identical and differ only in the N- and C-terminal regions. Peroxidase (Px) III possesses a mitochondrial and a glycosomal targeting signal whereas Px I and Px II do not have any known targeting sequences. The activity of *T. brucei* Px III was studied with hydrogen peroxide, cumene hydroperoxide and *t*-butyl hydroperoxide which are – in contrast to *T. cruzi* GPx I and II – all substrates of the enzyme. Regeneration of the reduced Px III by glutathione, *T. brucei* thioredoxin and the trypanothione/*T. brucei* tryparedoxin couple occurs at a rate of 2.2 M⁻¹s⁻¹, 4.7×10³ M⁻¹s⁻¹ and 2.4×10⁵ M⁻¹s⁻¹, respectively (Hillebrand et al., 2003). This clearly shows that the glutathione peroxidase-type *T. brucei* enzyme has a high preference for the trypanothione/tryparedoxin system and that the parasites have two types of tryparedoxin dependent peroxidases.

Recently, a plant-like ascorbate-dependent heme peroxidase has been described in *T. cruzi*. The enzyme, which specifically reduces hydrogen peroxide, represents the third class of peroxidases in trypanosomatids (Wilkinson et al., 2002a). Dehydroascorbate generated in the reaction is subsequently reduced by the spontaneous reaction with trypanothione.

Taken together, the parasites possess a variety of trypanothione-dependent peroxidases but none of the enzymes has a catalytic efficiency comparable with that of classical glutathione peroxidases. Since trypanosomes are well known for their sensitivity towards oxidative stress the physiological role of these enzymes is not yet clear. Even for the classical selenocysteine-containing glutathione peroxidases (GPX) only the cytosolic GPX I functions against oxidative stress, whereas the other three enzymes have been suggested to fulfil other needs (Brigelius-Flohé et al., 2002). For instance, mammalian phospholipid glutathione peroxidase acts also as an enzymatically inactive structural protein (Ursini et al., 1999). Future genetic approaches will clarify the role each individual peroxidase plays in the redox metabolism of the parasites.

## Trypanothione Reductase Is an Essential Enzyme

Trypanothione is kept in the dithiol state by trypanothione reductase (TR). In addition, trypanosomatids possess glutathione, mono-glutathionylspermidine and ovothiol (Vogt et al., 2001; Ariyanayagam and Fairlamb, 2001; Steenkamp, 2002b). All four low-molecular mass thiols are – either directly, in the case of trypanothione and mono-glutathionylspermidine disulfide, or indirectly by the spontaneous reaction with trypanothione, in the case of glutathione disulfide and ovothiol – kept reduced by TR. Several genetic approaches have undoubtedly shown that this key enzyme of the trypanothione metabolism is essential. In *L. donovani*, deletion of one allele was easily achieved but disruption of the second one was not possible or accompanied by a rearrangement of
the genomic locus resulting in a third unaffected gene copy (Dumas et al., 1997). Downregulation of TR to about 15% of wild-type cells in *L. donovani* by overexpression of a *trans*-dominant mutant homologue resulted in parasites that survived in resting but not in cytokine-activated macrophages (Tovar et al., 1998). In *T. brucei*, an inducible expression system was used to study the role of TR. Bloodstream cells were generated with only one TR gene under control of a tetracycline-inducible promoter which allowed regulation of TR activity between 1 and 400% of the wild-type level (Krieger et al., 2000). Trypanosomes with less than 10% of wild-type activity were unable to grow although the levels of reduced trypanothione and total thiols were unchanged. In media lacking reducing agents, the mutant parasites became hypersensitive towards hydrogen peroxide. The inducible knockout cell line was unable to infect mice in the absence of tetracycline. Obviously, the *de novo* synthesis of trypanothione and the residual TR activity are sufficient to maintain resting thiol levels but insufficient to cope with oxidative stress.

### Enzymes of the Trypanothione Metabolism as Drug Target Molecules

World-wide, 12 million people are infected by leishmania species (http://www.who.int/tdr/diseases/leish/files/leish-poster.pdf), 18 million people by *T. cruzi* (http://www.who.int/tdr/diseases/chagas/files/chagas-poster.pdf) and annually 300 000–500 000 people by African trypanosomes (http://www.who.int/tdr/diseases/tryp/files/tryp-poster.pdf). New drugs are therefore urgently needed.

The sensitivity of trypanosomatids toward oxidative stress and the absence of the pathway from the mammalian host render the enzymes of the trypanothione metabolism attractive target molecules. Interestingly, difluoromethylornithine (DFMO, Eflornithine), the first and only modern drug against African sleeping sickness, is a suicide inhibitor of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC). The enzyme catalyses the rate limiting step in the synthesis of spermidine which serves as precursor molecule of trypanothione (Figures 1 and 2). Treatment of *T. brucei* with DFMO causes multiple biochemical events such as a cell cycle arrest (Li et al., 1996), tremendously increased levels of decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine (Byers et al., 1991) and a decrease of the trypanothione level (Fairlamb et al., 1987). In *L. donovani* promastigotes, all three enzymes involved in spermidine synthesis, ODC, S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase and spermidine synthase are essential (Jiang et al., 1999; Roberts et al., 2001, 2002). Deletion of any of these genes lowers the levels of trypanothione, which demonstrates the role of spermidine as component of trypanothione. The suitability of the spermidine synthetic enzymes as potential drug target molecules remains to be proven since *L. donovani* can uptake exogenous polyamines (Basselin et al., 2000). In contrast to African trypanosomes, *T. cruzi* does not

synthesise spermidine but is entirely dependent on polyamine uptake (Hunter et al., 1994; Ariyanayagam and Fairlamb, 1997).

The first indication that interference with the thiol metabolism of trypanosomes may be exploited for drug development was the observation that mice infected with *T. brucei* could be cured by buthionine sulfoximine (BSO). The compound is an enzyme-activated inhibitor of γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase catalysing the first step in glutathione synthesis (Arrick et al., 1981). As described above, the synthesis of trypanothione can be achieved by different molecular arrangements. In the insect parasite *C. fasciculata*, two distinct enzymes catalyse formation of glutathionylspermidine and subsequently of trypanothione (Figure 2) (Oza et al., 2002a) whereas in *T. cruzi* a single polypeptide is responsible for both consecutive steps (Oza et al., 2002b). So far the glutathionylspermidine synthetase/amidase (GspS) from *E. coli* and *C. fasciculata* serve as model enzymes for inhibitor design approaches. These studies revealed a phosphinate substrate analogue as an efficient slow binding inhibitor of the *E. coli* enzyme with a \(K_i\) value of 3.2 μM and a \(K_i^*\) value of 7.8 nM (Chen et al., 1997). Recently a series of γ-Glu-Leu-X derivatives, where X is a nucleophilic group, was shown to be mixed-type inhibitors of GspS from *C. fasciculata*, the most efficient compounds having \(K_i\) and \(K_i'\) values in the low micromolar range (Amssoms et al., 2002). The trypanothione synthetic enzymes are clearly attractive targets since they do not have a counterpart in the mammalian host. However, the fact that the synthesis of trypanothione is not identical in pathogenic and non-pathogenic parasites needs validation to show that the enzymes from the insect parasite are appropriate models for drug design studies.

As described above, trypanothione reductase is essential for all trypanosomatids studied so far and thus an attractive drug target whereby the genetic approaches also indicate that for effective chemotherapy a drug dose that inhibits TR by 95% would be required (Krieger et al., 2000). During the last 15 years, a large number of studies have been aimed at inhibitors of TR that are suited as lead compounds for the development of new antiparasitic drugs (for recent reviews see Austin et al., 1999; Augustyns et al., 2001; D’Silva and Daunes, 2002; Schmidt and Krauth-Siegel, 2002). Most of the studies focused on compounds which inhibit the parasite enzyme but not human glutathione reductase (GR), the closest related host enzyme. The two reductases share many physical and chemical properties but show an exclusive specificity for their respective disulfide substrates. This is mainly due to the exchange of five residues rendering the disulfide substrate binding site positively charged in GR but more hydrophobic and negatively charged in TR. The charge distribution is complementary to that of the respective substrate, glutathione disulfide having an overall charge of -2 whereas that of trypanothione disulfide is +1.

As a prerequisite for a structure-based drug development, the three-dimensional structure of trypanothione

reductase has been solved in free form (Kuriyan *et al.*, 1991; Hunter *et al.*, 1992; Lantwin *et al.*, 1994), in complex with its substrates NADPH (Lantwin *et al.*, 1994), glutathionylspermidine (Bailey *et al.*, 1993) and trypanothione (Bond *et al.*, 1999) as well as the competitive inhibitor mepacrine (Jacoby *et al.*, 1996). These studies revealed that, in addition to the charge differences, the dimension of the disulfide substrate binding site of TR with about 22×20×28 Å³ is much wider than that of GR.

Most of the known inhibitors of TR are competitive inhibitors, covalent inhibitors or subversive substrates. If, as discussed above, the activity of TR has to be lowered by more than 95%, competitive ligands are only potential drugs if they have \( K_i \) values in the low nanomolar range or show slow binding behaviour. Probably more promising candidates are covalent inhibitors since in this case substrate accumulation cannot overcome inhibition. Another attractive type of compounds are subversive substrates, known examples being nitrofurans and naphthoquinones. Subversive substrates exert several simultaneous effects on the redox balance of the cell. They inhibit the regeneration of trypanothione, waste NADPH and are reduced to radical intermediates which then react with molecular oxygen to produce superoxide anions (Schirmer *et al.*, 1995). Although from theoretical considerations TR is one of the most promising drug target molecules, so far none of its inhibitors was suited to enter the clinical phase. Future work should include the determination of the cellular half-life of the enzyme. Only if the enzyme is sufficiently stable *in vivo*, irreversible inhibitors may be regarded as potential candidates. A structure-based rational drug design on TR is very difficult because of the extremely wide disulfide substrate binding site. In addition, since the large mammalian thioredoxin reductases (TrxR) (Williams *et al.*, 2000) are also structurally related to TR, human TrxR should be included in selectivity studies.
