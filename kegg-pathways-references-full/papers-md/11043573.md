We have investigated the cellular mechanisms by which changes in intracellular calcium (Ca²⁺) can differentially regulate gene expression. Two Ca²⁺ paradigms, involving prolonged and transient Ca²⁺ increases, were used. As a starting point, we studied the slow, prolonged elevation of Ca²⁺ caused by activation of 5-HT₁ receptors. We had previously shown that 5-HT₁ agonists inhibit calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) transcription and secretion. The Ca²⁺ ionophore, ionomycin, was used to produce a prolonged elevation of the Ca²⁺ signal similar to that generated by 5-HT₁ receptor agonists. Ionomycin treatment of the neuronal-like CA77 cell line specifically inhibited mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase stimulation of the CGRP enhancer and two synthetic MAP kinase-responsive reporter genes (4- to 10-fold). We then showed that ionomycin repression of promoter activity involved selective induction of MAP kinase phosphatase-1 (MKP-1), but not MKP-2, and that overexpression of MKP-1 was sufficient to repress CGRP enhancer activity. These effects were then compared with a Ca²⁺ paradigm involving a transient elevation in Ca²⁺ as seen after depolarization. At 4 h after the transient increase in Ca²⁺, the CGRP enhancer and synthetic MAP kinase-responsive reporter genes were stimulated. In contrast, exposure to depolarizing stimuli overnight caused only a less than 2-fold inhibition of promoter activity. We propose that the duration of the Ca²⁺ signal can determine the magnitude of a negative feedback loop that leads to differential regulation of MAP kinase-responsive genes.

## INTRODUCTION

Changes in intracellular Ca²⁺ levels regulate many important cellular processes, including motility, neurotransmitter release, proliferation, and gene expression (1, 2). Ca²⁺ has been shown to regulate gene expression via multiple signaling pathways by activating Ca²⁺-sensitive kinases such as calmodulin (CaM) kinases (3, 4) and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases (5). The MAP kinases, extracellular-regulated kinase-1 (ERK1), ERK2, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) have been reported to be activated by increases in intracellular Ca²⁺ that activate upstream kinases (6, 7). Activity of the MAP kinases is repressed by dual-specific protein phosphatases (8). MAP kinase phosphatase-1 (MKP-1) is a Ca²⁺-induced protein phosphatase (9) that can dephosphorylate multiple MAP kinases (8). Hence, regulation of MAP kinase pathways by Ca²⁺ involves a balance between stimulatory kinases and inhibitory phosphatases.

The calcitonin/calcitonin gene-related peptide (CT/ CGRP) gene has been shown to be MAP kinase responsive (10, 11). Alternative splicing of the CT/CGRP gene generates CGRP in a subset of peripheral and central neurons (12). CGRP is the most potent peptide vasodilator known and plays an important role in regulating peripheral and cerebral blood flow (13, 14). CGRP is also involved in mediating neurogenic inflammation (15) and functions to convey nociceptive information from the periphery to the central nervous system (16). Elevated serum levels of CGRP are associated with several pathological conditions, including migraines (17, 18). MAP kinase stimulation of CT/CGRP gene expression is mediated through two regulatory sites, a distal cell-specific enhancer (11) and a proximal Ras-responsive region (10). The cell-specific HLH-OB2 (HO) enhancer is synergistically activated by a helix-loop-helix (HLH) protein, USF, and an unidentified octamer-binding protein, OB2 (19, 20). Recently, HO enhancer activity was shown to be repressed by serotonergic antimigraine drugs (21).

We reported that activation of the serotonin class 1 (5-HT₁) receptors by currently used antimigraine drugs

Intracellular Ca²⁺ concentrations ([Ca²⁺]i) were measured using fura-2 and a microscopic digital imaging system. A, Basal Ca²⁺ levels in cells 1 min before addition of 1 μM ionomycin at time zero.

caused a prolonged increase in intracellular Ca²⁺ (21). The type 1 class of 5-HT receptors includes the 5-HT₁A, 5-HT₁B, 5-HT₁D, and 5-HT₁F receptors (22). The antimigraine drug sumatriptan has been reported to preferentially interact with the human and rat 5-HT₁B, 5-HT₁D, and 5-HT₁F receptors (22). Expression of each of these G protein-coupled receptors in nonneuronal cell lines has been shown to mediate a decrease in intracellular cAMP levels and cause a transient increase in calcium (23, 24). In contrast, we found that activation of 5-HT₁ receptors by serotonergic antimigraine drugs did not couple to decreases in cAMP but, rather, resulted in a prolonged elevation in intracellular Ca²⁺ in both cultured trigeminal ganglia neurons and the neuronal-like CA77 cell line (21, 25). These increases in Ca²⁺ correlated with inhibition of CGRP release, decreased CGRP messenger RNA levels, and repression of basal and MAP kinase-activated HO enhancer activity (11, 21). Based on these data, we hypothesized that the sustained increase in Ca²⁺ may be responsible for mediating the inhibitory effects of serotonergic antimigraine drugs on CGRP gene expression. However, the role of Ca²⁺ in regulating CGRP gene expression is not well understood.

In this study we investigated the mechanism by which Ca²⁺ can differentially regulate expression of MAP kinase-responsive genes. Initially, we show that a sustained increase in intracellular Ca²⁺ is sufficient to repress the activity of the CT/CGRP enhancer and two synthetic MAP kinase-responsive reporter genes. We then provide evidence that this repression is at least partially due to induction of MKP-1. In contrast, the activity of these genes was stimulated by transient elevations in Ca²⁺ after depolarization of CA77 cells. Based on our results, we propose that the duration of the Ca²⁺ signal can selectively regulate expression of MAP kinase-responsive genes.

**RESULTS**

Ionomycin Treatment Mimics the Effect of Antimigraine Drugs on Intracellular Ca²⁺ Levels

To directly test the role of Ca²⁺ in regulating CGRP promoter activity, we used the Ca²⁺ ionophore ionomycin and the neuronal-like cell line CA77 (26). Ionomycin preferentially binds Ca²⁺ ions in a 1:1 stoichi-

Fig. 2. CGS Causes a Sustained Increase in Intracellular Ca²⁺ Levels in CA77 Cells

Intracellular Ca²⁺ concentrations were measured as described in Fig. 1. A, Basal Ca²⁺ levels in cells 1 min before the addition of 10 μM CGS at time zero. B, Levels were relatively unchanged 1 min after the addition of CGS. C, Levels were elevated 20 min after the addition of CGS.

ometric ratio and then acts as a carrier to transport Ca²⁺ ions across the plasma membrane to increase the intracellular concentration of Ca²⁺. Treatment of CA77 cells with 1 μM ionomycin resulted in a sustained elevation in Ca²⁺ that was maintained for at least 20 min (Fig. 1). Ionomycin initially caused a rapid increase in Ca²⁺ levels that reached a peak of 200 nM about 1 min after addition. Ca²⁺ levels decreased slightly over the next couple of minutes, then reached an equilibrium of about 180 nM for the duration of the experiment. For comparison, we determined the effect of the selective 5-HT₁ receptor agonist, CGS 12066A (CGS), on intracellular Ca²⁺ levels. The selectivity of CGS for 5-HT₁ receptors has previously been demonstrated using the 5-HT₁ antagonist, methiothepin, which blocked the CGS effect on calcium amplitude in CA77 cells (11). Furthermore, we have shown that other selective 5-HT₁ receptor agonists, such as sumatriptan, TFMPP, and L-694,247, mediate physiological effects very similar to that of CGS (11). As shown in this study, addition of 10 μM CGS caused a relatively slow, steady increase in intracellular Ca²⁺ (Fig. 2). Ca²⁺ levels increased from a basal level of 75 nM to a peak of 180 nM that remained relatively unchanged for at least 22 min after CGS treatment. Hence, ionomycin treatment generated a Ca²⁺ signal that was similar in long-term

amplitude and duration to that observed after activation of 5-HT₁ receptors.

### Inhibition of CGRP Promoter Activity by Ionomycin

We then asked whether the sustained increase in Ca²⁺ mediated by ionomycin could inhibit CT/CGRP promoter activity. A firefly luciferase reporter gene containing a 1250-bp fragment of the 5′-flanking sequences of the rat CT/CGRP promoter was transiently transfected into CA77 cells. This promoter fragment contains regulatory sequences responsible for the cell-specific and cAMP-responsive activities of the CT/CGRP gene. Promoter activity was decreased in a dose-dependent manner by overnight treatment of CA77 cells with ionomycin (Fig. 3A). At the highest concentration of ionomycin tested (1 μM), CT/CGRP promoter activity was decreased to approximately 15% of control levels. In contrast, ionomycin treatment had only a minor inhibitory effect on the activity of a cotransfected cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter-β-galactosidase reporter gene (Fig. 3A) and a cotransfected CMV-Renilla luciferase reporter gene (Fig. 3B). To further demonstrate the specificity of the ionomycin effect on CT/CGRP promoter activity, a CT/CGRP

The –1250 bp CT/CGRP promoter fragment contains a proximal cAMP response region (gray box), and a distal enhancer that contains both cell-specific (black box) and noncell-specific (striped box) elements. A, CA77 cells were cotransfected with the CT/CGRP-luciferase and CMV-β-galactosidase reporter genes. The cells were pooled and divided into parallel dishes that were treated overnight with the indicated doses of ionomycin or the maximum volume of vehicle. The mean reporter activity and SE are shown from four independent experiments. The activities were normalized to the vehicle activities, which were 51,000 ± 4,000 light units/20 μg protein (CT/CGRP) and 178,000 ± 16,000 light units/20 μg protein (CMV-β-gal). B, Cells were cotransfected with the CT/CGRP-luciferase and CMV-Renilla luciferase (CMV-R-luc) reporter genes and treated as described.

Fig. 4. Ionomycin Repression of CGRP Enhancer Activity

CA77 cells were transfected with a series of reporter genes containing the cell-specific CT/CGRP HO enhancer. Ionomycin responsiveness was also tested using reporter genes that contain site-directed mutations in the cell-specific enhancer by insertion of a BamHI linker or a single adenosine residue (HO+A). Cells were treated with 1 μM ionomycin for either 20 h or 4 h as indicated, and then assayed for luciferase activity. The mean reporter activity per 20 μg protein with the SE is shown from at least four independent experiments.

activity by 1 μM ionomycin were not due to toxic effects, as cell viability was similar for the ionomycin- and vehicle-treated cells (>98% under all conditions; n = 3). This level of repression and specificity seen with ionomycin treatment is very similar in magnitude to that caused by the 5-HT₁ receptor agonist CGS (21).

We had previously reported that CGS repressed the CT/CGRP cell-specific HO enhancer that contains regulatory sites for HLH and octamer-binding transcription factors. To test whether ionomycin treatment would also repress HO enhancer activity, we compared the wild-type 1250-bp promoter activity with the same fragment in which the HLH site was mutated by insertion of a BamHI linker (20). In contrast to the wild-type CT/CGRP promoter, ionomycin treatment did not appreciably repress activity of the mutant enhancer (Fig. 4). Likewise, ionomycin greatly repressed activity of reporter genes containing the cell-specific HO enhancer linked to a minimal thymidine-kinase (TK) promoter 5- to 10-fold (Fig. 4). The –920 to –1250 bp region contains the 18-bp cell-specific enhancer as well as flanking noncell-specific regulatory sequences (19). The octamer-binding site within the HO enhancer is also involved in mediating the inhibitory effect of ionomycin, as mutation of this site by

addition of a single adenosine residue effectively abolished the ionomycin effect (Fig. 4). As luciferase activities for the CT/CGRP control constructs were more than 10-fold higher than values determined from cells transfected with promoterless vectors, reporter activities would be high enough to detect repression with ionomycin. In contrast to the 20-h treatment times, treatment with ionomycin for a shorter 4-h period did not appreciably affect luciferase activity (Fig. 4). As a control, we showed that ionomycin treatment had relatively no effect on thymidine kinase promoter activity (Fig. 4). These studies demonstrate that the ionomycin repression of CT/CGRP promoter activity is time dependent and requires both the HLH and octamer-binding sites within the enhancer.

Ionomycin Represses MEK1 Activation of the HO Enhancer

Having demonstrated that ionomycin could inhibit basal CT/CGRP HO enhancer activity, we then wanted to determine whether ionomycin could repress MAP kinase-stimulated enhancer activity. We had previously shown that overexpression of the MAP kinase MEK1 in CA77 cells increased HO enhancer

activity approximately 10-fold (11). In this study co-
transfection of the HO enhancer reporter plasmid and
an expression vector encoding MEK1 resulted in
about a 4-fold increase in enhancer activity (Fig. 5).
The difference in fold stimulation with MEK1 in this
study is probably attributable to the use of FBS in the
culture medium, which is known to contain factors that
can stimulate MAP kinases. Ionomycin repressed
MEK1-activated enhancer activity to 10% of the con-
trol value. This level of repression was similar to that
which we reported for CGS repression (21). These
results demonstrate that the sustained increase in in-
tracellular Ca²⁺ is sufficient to cause repression of
MAP kinase activation of the HO enhancer.

### Ionomycin Repression of Other MAP Kinase-
Responsive Genes

To determine whether ionomycin treatment could lead
to repression of other MAP kinase-responsive genes,
we used reporter genes known to be directly regulated
by MAP kinases. In this study we focused on the
ubiquitous transcription factor, Elk-1, that is a sub-
strate for all three MAP kinase pathways and plays an
important role in regulating immediate-early gene tran-
scription. CA77 cells were cotransfected with three
plasmids containing 1) a trans-activator gene that en-
codes the trans-activation domains of either Elk-1 or
c-Jun fused to the yeast Gal4 DNA-binding domain, 2)
a luciferase reporter gene containing Gal4 DNA-bind-
ing sites, and 3) an upstream MAP kinase activator
gene encoding constitutively activated forms of either
MEK1 or MEK kinase (MEKK). Although MEK1 selec-

**Fig. 6. Ionomycin Repression of Elk-1 and c-Jun Activation of Reporter Genes**

CA77 cells were transfected with a Gal4-luciferase reporter
plasmid and plasmids encoding fusion proteins of the Gal4
DNA-binding domain and trans-activation domains of either
Elk-1 or c-Jun. Constitutively activated MEK1 and MEKK
expression vectors were cotransfected with the ELK-1/Gal4
and c-Jun/Gal4 reporter plasmids, respectively, and the cells
were incubated in the absence or presence of increasing

tively activates ERK, MEKK has been shown to acti-
vate kinases that lead to phosphorylation of ERK (via
MEK1 activation) and JNK (via MEK4/7 activation) (27).
Overnight ionomycin treatment repressed both the
Elk-1- and c-Jun-dependent reporter genes in a dose-
dependent manner even in the presence of constitu-
tively activated MEK1 (Fig. 6A) or MEKK (Fig. 6B). This
dose curve was very similar to the ionomycin inhibition
of CT/CGRP promoter activity (Fig. 3A). In contrast to
the long-term treatment, activity of the Elk-1 reporter
gene was relatively unaffected by short-term (4-h)
ionomycin treatment (<1.5-fold; n = 3). Because of
the specificity of MEK1, we can conclude that iono-
mycin treatment is repressing ERK activity. Similarly,
as the c-Jun-dependent reporter is preferentially acti-
vated by JNK and not ERK (28), it is likely that iono-
mycin treatment can also repress JNK. Our data pro-
vide evidence that sustained increases in intracellular

Ca²⁺ are responsible for repressing the action of the MAP kinases, ERK and JNK.

Ionomycin-Mediated Decrease in the Level of Phosphorylated ERK

As ionomycin treatment repressed MEK1 activation of the CGRP enhancer and Elk-1-responsive reporter genes, we predicted that ionomycin may be inhibiting ERK activity. Phosphorylation of specific threonine and tyrosine residues by MEK1 leads to activation of ERK. We used Western blot analysis and phospho-specific ERK antibodies to determine whether ionomycin was inhibiting ERK phosphorylation. In untreated control cells, the phosphorylated forms of ERK1 (44 kDa) and ERK2 (42 kDa) were easily detected (Fig. 7A). Ionomycin treatment caused a marked decrease in the levels of phosphorylated ERK1 and ERK2. This result is in agreement with the ionomycin-mediated repression of basal CGRP enhancer activity (Fig. 3A). As a control, the phospho-specific antibodies were removed, and Western blot analysis was performed using antibodies that recognize both the phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms of ERK1 and ERK2. There was no appreciable change in the total levels of ERK1 and ERK2 after ionomycin treatments (Fig. 7B). These data suggest that ionomycin repression of MEK-1-stimulated CGRP enhancer and Elk-1-responsive reporter genes is mediated by inhibition of active ERK levels.

MKP-1 Is Sufficient to Inhibit CGRP Enhancer Activity

The phosphatase MKP-1 has been reported to dephosphorylate several MAP kinases, including ERK (8). To determine whether the ionomycin-mediated decrease in active ERK levels might involve up-regulation of MKP-1 expression, cell lysates from CA77 cells were analyzed by Western blot analysis using antibodies directed against MKP-1. Initially, we showed that the level of MKP-1 was elevated upon activation of 5-HT₁ receptors by CGS in CA77 cells (Fig. 8A), in agreement with our previously published finding (21). However, the connection between the Ca²⁺ increase and MKP-1 in these cells was not established. We demonstrated that ionomycin treatment markedly induced the expression of MKP-1 in CA77 cells (Fig. 8A). To test whether MKP-1 expression correlated with repression of stimulated CGRP enhancer activity, MKP-1 levels were determined in the presence of constitutively active MEK1. Consistent with the functional data, MKP-1 was also increased in ionomycin-treated cells transfected with the MEK1 expression vector (Fig. 8A). In contrast to MKP-1, treatment of CA77 cells with CGS or ionomycin decreased the level of another MAP kinase phosphatase, MKP-2 (Fig. 8B). To directly demonstrate that the increase in MKP-1 levels was involved in repressing CT/CGRP promoter activity, CA77 cells were cotransfected with reporter plasmids and an MKP-1 expression plasmid. Overexpression of MKP-1 greatly reduced the basal activity of both the –1250 bp fragment of the CT/CGRP promoter and the cell-specific HO enhancer (Fig. 8C). As a control, MKP-1 had no effect on TK-luciferase activity (Fig. 8C). These data provide direct evidence for a role for MKP-1 in regulating the MAP kinase-responsive CGRP enhancer.

Depolarization Leads to a Transient Increase in Ca²⁺ and Stimulation of Reporter Genes

It has been reported that depolarization of neuronal cells leads to an increase in intracellular Ca²⁺ and activation of MAP kinase pathways (29). However, we have shown that several MAP kinase-responsive reporter genes are repressed by an elevation in Ca²⁺ levels after 5-HT₁ receptor activation (11) or ionomycin treatment. In an attempt to understand this apparent paradox, intracellular Ca²⁺ levels were measured in CA77 cells after depolarization with potassium chloride (KCl). Ca²⁺ levels rapidly increased from a basal level of about 75 nM to a peak of about 210 nM after depolarization (Fig. 9). After the initial spike in Ca²⁺ levels, the Ca²⁺ concentration within the cell slowly returned to near-basal levels by 20 min. This transient increase in Ca²⁺ is in stark contrast to the prolonged increase observed with CGS or ionomycin treatment (Figs. 1 and 2). Interestingly, the fold change in Ca²⁺ levels (~3-fold) was similar for all three stimuli used in this study.

CA77 cells were untreated (con) or transfected with MEK-1 expression plasmid (MEK1) and then treated with 10 μM CGS or 1 μM ionomycin (iono) for 20 h. The expression of MKP-1 (A) or MKP-2 (B) was determined by Western blot analysis using 10 μg cell lysates and specific anti-MKP-1 or -MKP-2 antibodies, respectively. The 38-kDa MKP-1 and 42-kDa MKP-immunoreactive bands are indicated. A 50-kDa nonspecific band was also detected with the MKP-2 antibody. C, CA77 cells were transfected with CT/CGRP- or TK-luciferase reporter plasmids and a control expression plasmid CMV-5 (-) or cotransfected with a CMV-MKP-1 expression vector (+) in DMEM/F-12/ITS medium. After 20 h, luciferase activity was measured and expressed as the mean light units per 20 μg protein ± SE from at least three independent experiments.

To determine the effect of the transient increase in Ca²⁺ after depolarization on the CGRP enhancer and Elk-1 reporter genes, CA77 cells were treated with 60 mM KCl for 4 or 20 h before measuring luciferase activity. Chemical depolarization with KCl for 4 h caused an almost 3-fold increase in CGRP enhancer activity (Fig. 10A) and about a 6-fold increase in Elk-1 reporter gene activity. These findings are in agreement with studies in other systems that have reported depolarization-activated MAP kinases that can phosphorylate Elk-1 (30, 31). In contrast, overnight treatment with KCl mildly repressed activation of both the CGRP enhancer and Elk-1 reporter gene less than 2-fold. The activity of the control reporter plasmid containing only the TK promoter was relatively unchanged by the 4-h or overnight KCl treatment. Thus, depolarizing stimuli can only transiently stimulate MAP kinase-responsive gene expression.

The stimulation of CGRP enhancer and Elk-1-responsive reporter genes suggested that depolarization was increasing the level of active ERK. To test this prediction, we measured the level of phosphorylated ERK by Western blot analysis using phospho-specific ERK antibodies. In untreated control cells, the phosphorylated forms of ERK1 (44 kDa) and ERK2 (42 kDa) were detected (Fig. 11A). Depolarization of CA77 cells

caused a time-dependent increase in the levels of phosphorylated ERK1 and ERK2 (Fig. 11A). The active level of ERK2 increased more rapidly than that of ERK1, but the levels of both proteins were greatest at the 60 min treatment time. Interestingly, phosphorylated ERK1 and ERK2 levels returned to near-basal levels by 240 min. As a control, the phospho-specific antibodies were removed, and Western blot analysis was performed using antibodies that recognize both the phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms of ERK1 and ERK2. The total levels of ERK1 and ERK2 were relatively unaffected by KCl treatment, suggesting that the effect of KCl was not due to changes in the amount of total ERK proteins (Fig. 11B). Based on these data, it is likely that the KCl-mediated increases in CGRP and Elk-1 reporter gene activities are mediated at least in part by activation of ERK.

DISCUSSION

Ca²⁺ is known to act within the contexts of space, time, and amplitude to regulate gene expression. For example, the amplitude and duration of the Ca²⁺ increase (32), the subcellular location of Ca²⁺ (33, 34),

and the frequency of Ca²⁺ oscillations (35) have been shown to differentially activate different transcriptional regulatory proteins. In this study we focused our studies on understanding the role of duration in regulating MAP kinase-responsive genes in a neuronal-like cell line.

We found that the duration of a Ca²⁺ signal can differentially regulate the expression of both complex and synthetic MAP kinase-responsive enhancers. The foundation of the differential regulation is the dynamic balance between kinase and phosphatase activities that control MAP kinase pathways (Fig. 12). A transient increase in intracellular Ca²⁺, such as that caused by depolarizing stimuli, stimulates MAP kinase activity, leading to activation of the CT/CGRP HO enhancer and Elk-1 reporter genes. In the CA77 cells, this increase was maximal after shorter treatment times, and in fact a slight repression was seen after longer treatments. This is in agreement with studies in other systems demonstrating that neuronal depolarization activates MAP kinases and gene expression (6, 30, 31), and that MAP kinase activation can also induce MKPs to create a negative feedback loop (36, 37). A key point of our model is that a prolonged Ca²⁺ signal results in a much greater magnitude of MKP induction than that

The HO enhancer, TK promoter, and Elk-1/Gal4 reporter genes were transfected into CA77 cells incubated in the absence (-) or presence (+) of 60 mM KCl for 20 or 4 h before measuring luciferase activity. The effects of KCl on the HO-TK promoter and control TK promoter luciferase activities (A) and the Elk-1 reporter gene (B) are shown. The data in each experiment were normalized to the luciferase reporter activity in the absence of KCl, which was set at 1.

seen after the transient signal (Fig. 12). Hence, after activation of 5-HT₁ receptors and ionomycin treatment, the prolonged Ca²⁺ signal leads to repression of MAP kinase-responsive genes due to induction of MKP-1. The induction of MKP-1 under these conditions is consistent with previous studies by ourselves (11) and by Meloche and colleagues (9). The requirement for synthesis of MKP-1 would account for the lack of stimulation at the early time points and the lag before repression.

Our study has shown activation and repression of a single transcription factor (Elk-1) by different Ca²⁺ signals. This result extends the important findings of Dolmetsch et al. (32), who showed that the type of Ca²⁺ signal leads to differential activation of different transcriptional regulators (nuclear factor-κB, JNK, and nuclear factor-AT). Similar to our findings, data from recent studies have shown that Ca²⁺-dependent control of Elk-1 involves a dynamic balance between kinase and phosphatase activities (38, 39). We have been able to key on the duration of the Ca²⁺ signal because the transient and prolonged Ca²⁺ signals had very similar amplitudes, with little or no oscillation. The rate of Ca²⁺ increase also did not appear to play a key role in mediating the inhibition of MAP kinase-respon-

Fig. 11. Stimulation of ERK Phosphorylation by KCl Treatment

CA77 cells were untreated (con) or treated with 60 mM KCl for the indicated times (minutes) before harvesting. A, Cell lysates were analyzed by Western blot analysis using antiactive ERK antibodies that recognize only the phosphorylated ERK proteins. The immunoreactive bands for ERK1 (44 kDa) and ERK2 (42 kDa) are indicated. B, The same blot as that shown in A was stripped and reprobed with antibodies that recognize both the unphosphorylated and phosphorylated forms of ERK. The active ERK1 or ERK2 levels were normalized to the density of the corresponding total ERK band and are reported as the fold change relative to control ERK levels, which were made equal to 1.

sive genes, as ionomycin caused a very rapid increase compared with the slow gradual increase seen after CGS treatment. This contrasts with other systems in which gene activation was dependent on the rate of Ca²⁺ increase (40). Also, we did not see any difference in the localization of the Ca²⁺ signal after KCl, CGS, or ionomycin treatments, although we cannot completely rule out this possibility due to the resolution of the assay. Taken together, our results demonstrate the importance of the duration of the Ca²⁺ signal in regulating MAP kinase-responsive gene expression.

An intriguing finding was that prolonged Ca²⁺ signals lowered the levels of a different MAP kinase phosphatase, MKP-2. Evidence for differential induction of MKP-1 and MKP-2 in response to growth factors, stress-inducing agents, and other agents has been reported, suggesting that these phosphatases may perform distinct physiological functions (36, 41). MKP-2 is coexpressed with MKP-1 in a variety of tissues, but the relative levels of messenger RNA can vary (41). Thus, it is interesting to speculate that 5-HT₁ receptors might either stimulate or inhibit MAP kinase pathways depending on the relative complement of

signals may have general applications for regulating MAP kinase pathways and MAP-kinase responsive genes.

### MATERIALS AND METHODS

#### Cell Culture

CA77 cells were maintained in Ham's F-12/DMEM (low glucose; 1:1) and 10% FBS at 37°C in 7% CO₂. Penicillin and streptomycin were added to all media. CA77 cells were subcultured in serum-free medium supplemented with insulin, transferrin, and selenium (ITS; Collaborative Biomedical Products, Bedford, MA) 24 h before treatment, as previously described (21). Serum-free medium was used for all experiments except those involving ionomycin. We found that the effects of 5-HT₁ receptor activation and KCl stimulation on promoter activities were maximal when CA77 cells were incubated in serum-free medium. The reason for this is not known, but it may be due to factors in the serum that modulate signaling pathways that confound the effects of 5-HT₁ agonists and depolarization. Cells used in the ionomycin experiments were maintained in serum-containing medium, because cell viability was greatly reduced after long-term ionomycin treatment in serum-free medium. Cell viability after CGS or ionomycin treatments was determined by trypan blue exclusion (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). The pyrroloquinoline CGS 12066A monomaleate was obtained from Research Biochemicals International (Antic, MA) and was prepared and used as previously described (21). The Ca²⁺ ionophore ionomycin was purchased from Calbiochem-Novabiochem (La Jolla, CA) and was prepared in 100% dimethylsulfoxide. In all studies the cells were treated with equivalent amounts of vehicle.

#### Ca²⁺ Measurements

Intracellular Ca²⁺ levels in CA77 cells were measured using a video microscope digital image analysis system (Photon Technology International, Inc., South Brunswick, NJ) as described previously (21). Briefly, CA77 cells grown on laminin-coated 25-mm glass coverslips were maintained at 37°C in phenol- and serum-free medium supplemented with ITS 24 h before the start of the Ca²⁺ imaging procedure. Cells were incubated in DMEM (high glucose) containing 0.2% BSA and 1 μM fura-2/AM (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) for 30 min at 37°C in 7% CO₂. After washing the cells twice with DMEM/BSA, the cells were incubated in DMEM/F-12/ITS medium for at least 30 min to allow complete hydrolysis of fura-2/AM before measurement using a Nikon Diaphot microscope. Basal Ca²⁺ levels were measured for a minimum of 120 s in cells incubated in DMEM/F-12/FBS medium for the ionomycin treatments or DMEM/F-12/ITS medium for the CGS-treated cells. An equal volume of medium containing CGS, ionomycin, or vehicle (at 2 times the final concentration) was added directly to the cells, and measurements were recorded every 10 sec for more than 20 min on a heated stage at 37°C. Ca²⁺ levels within the entire cell were averaged from masked images to obtain the whole cell Ca²⁺ concentration. The concentration of Ca²⁺ in intact cells was determined for each buffer system based on the original equation described by Grykyewicz et al. (47) and assuming a K_d of Ca²⁺-fura-2 interaction to be 225 nM. Each experimental condition was repeated a minimum of three times.

#### Plasmids and Transfection Assays

The rat CT/CGRP and TK promoter luciferase reporter plasmids, CT/CGRP-β-galactosidase reporter plasmid, and the

Calcium Regulation of Gene Expression

CMV β-galactosidase plasmid have been described previously (19–21). The Renilla luciferase control vector (pRL-CMV) was purchased from Promega Corp. The Myc-tagged MKP-1 expression vector, controlled by the CMV promoter and containing sequence for the first 314 amino acids, was provided by Dr. Jeffrey Pessin (48). The plasmids containing CMV-MEK1 (S218/222E, Δ<sub>32–51</sub>), CMV-MEKK<sub>380–672</sub>, Elk-1<sub>307–428</sub>, and c-Jun<sub>1–223</sub> activation domains fused to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain (1–147), and Gal4 promoter-luciferase have been described previously (11).

CA77 cells were transiently transfected by electroporation essentially as described previously (21). Approximately 1–2 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells were transfected with 5–10 μg luciferase reporter plasmid DNA, 50 μg MKP-1 plasmid, and/or 2–5 μg MEK1 or MEKK expression plasmid DNA using a Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., gene pulsar apparatus (Richmond, CA). The amount of DNA transfected into the cells was kept constant by addition of the empty expression vector CMV-5 (11). Transfected cells were equally divided among 60-mm dishes for controls or treatment with regulatory agents. This experimental protocol insured that the control and treated cells had equal transfection efficiencies. After transfection, cells were incubated in DMEM/F-12/FBS medium with either ionomycin or vehicle control (dimethylsulfoxide) for 20 or 4 h before measuring luciferase activity. Transfected cells used in the depolarization studies were incubated in DMEM/F-12/ITS medium only (control) or with 60 mM KCl as described for the ionomycin treatment. To control for changes in osmolarity, 60 mM NaCl was substituted for KCl in the control medium. In all experiments, NaCl treatment had no effect on promoter activity. For the time-course study, transfected cells were incubated in 1 μM ionomycin for 20 or 4 h before harvesting the cells. Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were measured using reagents from Promega Corp., and β-galactosidase activity was determined using Galacto-Light reagents (Tropix, Bedford, MA). Each experimental condition was repeated in at least three independent experiments in duplicate. In some experiments, transfection efficiencies were normalized to β-galactosidase activity. The β-galactosidase normalization did not significantly alter the relative activities.

### Western Blot Analysis

Cells were treated as detailed for the reporter assays, and Western blot analysis was performed as previously described (11). After the various treatments, CA77 cells were rinsed once with ice-cold PBS, removed from the plate by scraping, transferred to microcentrifuge tubes, and spun for 1 min at 4 C to pellet the cells. After removal of the supernatant, the cells were resuspended in lysis buffer [20 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mM β-glycerophosphate, 1 mM sodium vanadate, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin] and allowed to incubate for 5 min on ice. The cells were lysed by sonication, microcentrifuged for 10 min at 4 C, transferred to a new tube, and stored at –80 C. Protein was determined by the Bradford method.

Equal amounts of cell lysate (10 μg) were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes as recommended by the manufacturer (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Membranes were blocked in 20 mM Tris/140 mM sodium chloride containing 0.1% Tween-20 (TBST) plus 5% nonfat dry milk for 1 h before incubation with primary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. The antiaactive MAPK polyclonal antibodies (Promega Corp.) directed against phosphorylated ERK1 and ERK2 were diluted 1:5,000 in TBST. The MKP-1- or MKP-2-specific antibodies (V-15 or S-18, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) were used at 1 μg/ml in TBST containing 3% BSA. After extensive washing with TBST, the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey antirabbit IgG (Promega Corp.) diluted 1:10,000 in TBST plus 3% BSA. After thorough washing with TBST, the immunoreactive bands were visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Arlington Heights, IL). Antibodies bound to active ERK were removed by incubation in 62.5 mM Tris (pH 6.8) containing 100 mM β-mercaptoethanol and 2% SDS for 30 min at 50 C. The membranes were then probed using antibodies that recognize both the phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms of ERK1 and ERK2 (ERK1, K-23; 1 μg/ml; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). The signals were quantitated using NIH Image software. Each condition was repeated in at least two independent experiments.
