Summary: The bacterial superantigens are protein toxins that bind to major histocompatibility complex class II and T-cell receptor to stimulate large numbers of T cells. The majority are produced by the Gram-positive organisms Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes and are the causative agents in toxic shock syndrome, an acute disease caused by the sudden and massive release of T-cell cytokines into the blood stream. The structure and function of the superantigens has revealed a common architecture that is also shared by another group of staphylococcal virulence factors called the superantigen-like proteins (SSL). Together, this family of structurally related molecules highlights how a common pathogenic organism has employed a simple but adaptable protein to generate an armamentarium of potent defense molecules designed to target of the innate and adaptive immune response.

Introduction

Bacterial superantigens (Sags) are a well described family of 40 secreted protein toxins produced by Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes with orthologues existing in group C Streptococcus equi and group G Streptococcus dysgalactiae. Two quite unrelated Sags are also produced by Mycoplasma arthritidis mitogen (MAM) and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis mitogen (YPM). Systemic intoxication by a Sag can lead to the life-threatening condition toxic shock syndrome (TSS), caused by a sudden cytokine storm when large numbers of T cells are stimulated by the Sag cross-linking major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II antigens and T-cell receptors (TCR). Sags are thus virulence factors that target the adaptive response through the immunological synapse. They are perhaps most noted for their extreme potency with some members stimulating human T cells in vitro at 1 femtogram/ml (10⁻¹⁵ g/ml), a feature that if nothing else highlights the exquisite sensitivity of T-cell recognition of MHC-bound antigen.

The presence of even a small amount of a Sag in the bloodstream rapidly elevates many cytokines to toxic levels, but interleukin-2 (IL-2), interferon-γ (IFN-γ), and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) are generally believed to be the main culprits in toxicity (1). The suddenness and magnitude of the cytokine release dictates the severity and outcome for the

patient, and thus, the most important survival factor is the level of pre-existing neutralizing antibodies that block the initial binding of the Sag to MHC class II.

TSS represents the extreme outcome of Sag function, and it is difficult to comprehend how this condition ever benefits the bacterium. Rather, the advantage is almost certainly gained at vastly lower concentrations during the early stages of infection when the Sag induces a localized anesthesia of the innate responses that are essential for rapid clearance of *S.* aureus or *S.* pyogenes. What is abundantly clear is that Sags are an asset to these Gram-positive bacteria. Only continued positive selective pressure can explain their remarkable molecular diversity, genetic mobility, and widespread prevalence in clinical isolates.

### A brief history

The term superantigen was coined by John Kappler in 1989 (2) to denote their ability to stimulate large numbers of T cells, although this was an immunologist's redefinition of a group of toxins that had been studied for many years prior as staphylococcal enterotoxins (SE) that caused food poisoning (3) and toxic shock (4) and the streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxins (SPEs), agents causing scarlet fever (5), pyrogenicity (6), and streptococcal TSS (STSS) (7, 8).

Potent in vitro lymphocyte proliferation was a common feature of all the purified SEs, SPEs, and TSST-1 (9). In a series of independent studies, the SE and SPEs were found to share two common functions: the ability to bind as whole molecules directly to MHC class II (10–12) and also to the TCR β-chain (2, 13) outside the normal antigen-binding interface that governed peptide MHC recognition (14). At the time, their activity seemed remarkably similar to the enigmatic minor lymphocyte stimulating (mls) antigens that caused strong alloreactive responses between MHC matched strains of mice (15). Charles Janeway (16, 17) first suggested that the SEs and the mls antigens might act by cross-linking the MHC class II and TCR Vβ domain. The mls antigens were ultimately shown to be products of the endogenous mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) (18–20) incorporated into the mouse genome to delete T cells as they mature in the thymus to prevent later acquisition by gut B cells infected with wildtype MMTV (21). Surprisingly, the mls antigens, which are coded for by a gene located in the 3′ LTR of the MMTV virus, are type II membrane proteins, and bear no relationship with bacterial Sags whatsoever. Unfortunately, the mls proteins have defied all attempts to produce them in sufficient quantity to study their molecular interactions with MHC class II and TCR.

The Sag era spans 18 years of intensive research into every aspect of their biology. Our current picture is of an extraordinarily potent set of toxins that usurp the central event in adaptive immunity: the immunological synapse between antigen-presenting cell (APC) and T cell. Perhaps the most significant discovery in recent years has been the finding that Sags belong to a much larger family that includes the staphylococcal superantigen-like proteins (SSLs). These are built from the same two polypeptide domains but display a different set of anti-immune functions targeting the innate response. Together the Sags and the SSLs reveal how a simple protein has been repeatedly modified to produce an armamentarium of immune defense molecules.

#### The staphylococcal enterotoxins

Staphylococcal enterotoxin A (SEA) was first identified by Merlin Bergdoll and colleagues (22) at the Food Research Institute in Wisconsin from the culture of an isolate from a food poisoning outbreak. Ingestion of microgram amounts of the purified SEA elicited classic staphylococcal food poisoning, characterized by vomiting and diarrhea within 1–2 h of ingestion and lasting 6–12 h (3). At present, 20 serologically distinct staphylococcal Sags have been described, comprising TSS toxin-1 (TSST-1), the SEs A-E, G-J, and the staphylococcal enterotoxin-like (enterotoxicity unproven) toxins (SEL) K-R and U, and the recently identified SEL-U2 and SEL-V (23, 24). Not all Sags are enterotoxic and a new nomenclature was introduced in 2004 to distinguish those with proven emetic activity (SEs) with those that remain unconfirmed (SEls) (25). There is remarkable sequence variation between members of the staphylococcal Sag family. The most distant members, SEB and SEK, have 15% amino acid identity. Excluding allelic variants, the most similar are SEA and SEE with 90% amino acid identity yet still display different TCR Vβ profiles (26).

All the staphylococcal Sags are potent T cells mitogens but exhibit different preferences for MHC class II alleles and also produce distinct TCR Vβ profiles. This suggests that their diversity has been driven by a need to stimulate as many different T cells as possible while retaining MHC and TCR as target molecules (Table 1). Most staphylococcal Sags are encoded by accessory genetic elements such as prophages, transposons, plasmids, and pathogenicity islands (PIs). These mobile elements are not uniformly distributed among clinical isolates, and there are significant variations in these regions between different strains most likely due to horizontal transfer. For example, the PI vSaβ of staphylococcal strain N315 harbors the genes for SEG, SEL, SEM, SEN, and SEO, while the same island in strain MW2 does not carry any sag genes. The φSa3 prophage of strain MW2 harbors genes for SEA, SEG2, and SEK2, while φSa3 of strain Mu50 carries just the gene for SEA (27). The best-characterized staphylococcal PI is

P₅₀(h) = concentration needed for half maximum proliferation of human T cells.
The gene for SPE-A was cloned by Ferretti and coworkers in 1986 (34) and shown to be encoded by a gene located on the bacteriophage T12. Pyrogenicity (the rapid increase in body temperature) was believed to be the principal consequence of the streptococcal toxins, but this effect is now known to be a secondary result of the T-cell release of IL-1 and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α). Mutations that reduce T-cell mitogenicity also eliminate the pyrogenic effect of the SPEs. The discovery of novel streptococcal exotoxins has accelerated with the completion of several genome sequencing projects and the total number now stands at 11: SPEA, SPEC, SPEG, SPEH, SPEI, SPEJ, SPEK, SPEL, SPEM, SSA, and the highly polymorphic SMEZ. The rapid identification of new sequences has resulted in some confusion where new Sags have been given two different names. For example, SPEK from a serotype M3 strain from USA (35) is identical to SPEL from an M3 strain from Japan (36) and an M89 strain from New Zealand (37). To avoid confusion, we refer to this Sag as SPEK/L. SPEL from an M18 strain from USA (38) is the same as SPEM found in New Zealand (37) we refer to as SPEL/M (Fig. 1).

Some streptococcal Sags are more closely related to staphylococcal Sags than to other streptococcal Sags, e.g., SPEA, SPEH, and SSA belong to the same subgroup as the staphylococcal enterotoxins SEB, SEC, and SEG (Fig. 1). The other streptococcal Sags form another larger group that includes SPEC, SPEG, SPEJ, SPEK/L, SPEL/M, and SPEM. The most likely cause for these inter-species similarities is horizontal gene transfer. A study of 103 clinical *S.* pyogenes isolates from New Zealand showed that all possessed some form of *speG* and *smeZ*, while the *speH* gene was only present in 24% of the isolates (39). This is consistent with *speH* being encoded on a mobile DNA element. The *smeZ* gene displays extensive allelic variation and appears to be in linkage disequilibrium with the M/emm serotype. The allelic variation does not affect protein function but does result in significant antigenic differences that are recognized by naturally occurring neutralizing antibodies (39). This surface variation in SMEZ has been driven by the need to escape antibody neutralization while retaining human TCR Vβ4 and Vβ8 specificity.

Compared with the staphylococcal Sags, the streptococcal Sags show a wider variation in potencies to stimulate human T cells with P₅₀ values ranging from 0.02 pg/ml (SMEZ-2) to 50 pg/ml (SPEH) (40) (Table 1). SMEZ-2 is the most potent Sag described in the literature thus far and has recently been shown to be the major immunoreactive agent of *S.* pyogenes (41). High levels of circulating bioactive SMEZ were found in serum samples of two patients with STSS, confirming that SMEZ was the culprit in these two cases and further suggesting that it plays a role in STSS in general (42).

Those molecules known to (or are predicted to based on conserved residues) bind MHC class II via the C-terminal Zn site are shown in red. Note how TSST-1 clusters with the SSLs.

Orthologues of GAS Sags have been found in group C and group G streptococci. The *S.* equi superantigens SePH and SePI are highly homologous to their GAS counterparts SPEH and SPEI (43). Another two GCS superantigen genes, *speLse* and *speMse* were identified by data mining of the *S.* equi strain 4047 genome based on their homology to *speL* and *speM* (37).

Other Sags include the *Streptococcus dysgalactiae*-derived mitogen (SDM) (44) and SPEG<sup>dys</sup> (45). Both Sags were identified from *S.* dysgalactiae subsp. *equisimilis*.

### The SSL toxins

The *ssl* genes were identified by screening staphylococcal genomes using the two conserved amino acid motifs located in the N-terminal and C-terminal domains of Sags (46). These motifs Y-G(2)-(LIV)-(I)-(N)-x(2)-N (Prosite-PS00277)

and K - x(2) - (LIVF) - x(4) - (LIVF) - D - x(3) - R - x(2) - L - x(5)
- (LIV) - Y (Prosite - PS00278), define the interface between the
N-terminal oligosaccharide-binding (OB) domain and C-terminal
β-grasp domain (Fig. 2A). Ten of the 14 sl genes exist as a
contiguous region located in staphylococcal PI SaPIn2 (strain
N315), while the ssl11 gene is located adjacent to the main cluster
and ssl12, 13 and 14 form a discrete cluster some 0.7 MB down-
stream from the main sl gene cluster in the MW2 strain. The tst-1
gene resides in another PI called SaPIn1 (strain N315), while a
third PI, SaPIn3 (strain N315), contains an enterotoxin (sag) gene
cluster (47). Sequence comparison of the SSLs and Sags reveals an
intriguing feature. TSST-1, which is functionally a Sag, is more
similar in sequence to the SSLs (Fig. 1). TSST-1 was always an
orphan sequence in any global amino acid alignment of Sags,
suggesting that it was either a sole survivor of an early divergence
or that it evolved from another similar gene family, which now
appears to be the SSLs (Fig. 1). The SSLs are not mitogenic to T cells
and do not bind MHC class II (48). Rather, they display a wide
array of activities targeting key elements in the innate immunity.

The function of several SSLs has been determined. The OB-
fold domain of SSL7 binds to monomeric and secretory forms
of immunoglobulin A (IgA) from multiple species (the notable
exceptions being rabbit and mouse) by targeting the FcαRI-
binding site located in the Cα2–Cα3 region in the Fc portion of
the IgA (48–50). SSL7 blocks the ability of IgA to bind to
FcαRI, and thus, one of its possible roles is to assist in bacterial
survival at the mucosal surface. The β-grasp C-terminal domain
binds tightly to complement factor C5 and is a potent inhibitor
of complement mediated hemolytic activity (48) (Fig. 2).

SSL5 (51) and SSL11 (52) target neutrophils. Each molecule
possesses a glycan-binding site in the C-terminal domain specific
for the trisaccharide sialyllactosamine (sLacNac). sLacNac is
commonly expressed on cell surface glycoproteins, for example
P-selectin glycoprotein (PSGL-1), the ligand for P-selectin that
regulates neutrophil adherence to endothelial cells. Recombinant
SSL5 and SSL11 are potent inhibitors of neutrophil adherence
(53) and are also rapidly internalized into neutrophils (52). The
sLacNac carbohydrate-binding site is present on a subset of the
SSLs including SSL2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 11 (51).

Superantigens from other bacteria
Mycoplasmas are the smallest self-replicating microorganisms.
Mycoplasma arthritis causes acute inflammatory infections and
chronic joint disease in rodents. Thus far, only one Sag from
this organism has been identified and named Mycoplasma
arthritis mitogen (MAM) (54). MAM is unrelated by amino-
acid sequence homology to members of the staphylococcal/
streptococcal Sag family and lacks the characteristic Prosite

Fig. 2. The two domain structure of Sags and SSLs. The staphylococcal
and streptococcal Sags and staphylococcal SSLs consist of two protein domains.
(A). The β-grasp domain (blue) is a twisted β-sheet of four to five antiparallel
strands that pack against a highly conserved α-helix (the α4 helix). Residues
colored in red are conserved in all Sags and SSLs. The OB domain is shown in
orange and consists of a five-stranded β-sheets that coils to form a β-barrel
and is capped by a small α-helix. The N-terminus extends and forms an
α-helix (α1) that packs against the top of the α4 helix in the β-grasp domain
to stabilize the molecule. Residues that are fully conserved in the OB-fold of
Sags and SSLs (colored in red) are located on the long descending loop that
follows the last β-strand and are presumably essential for close packing against
the C-terminal domain. (B). The structures of two Sags and two SSLs are
displayed to highlight the similarities in structure and the remarkably variation
in functional sites. SMEZ-2 is the most potent of all Sags and binds to MHC
class II β-chain via a Zn atom located in the β-sheet of the C-terminal domain.
Residues involved in TCR binding are primarily located along the top of the
OB-fold. In TSST-1, the MHC class II α-chain binding site is in the OB-fold,
and the TCR binding residues are located on the top of the C-terminal domain.
In SSL11, a carbohydrate-binding site is located on the face of the C-terminal
domain, allowing it to bind to glycoproteins that express the trisaccharide
sialyllactosamine. SSL7 has two functional sites. The OB-fold binds to the Fc
region of IgA to block FcαRI while the C-terminal domain binds tightly to the
complement C5 and is a potent inhibitor of end-stage complement.

signature motifs described above. MAM binds preferentially to
murine H-2E, or the human equivalent human leukocyte
antigen-DR (HLA-DR) with preference for DR4, DR7, and
DR12 (55). Polymorphisms at HLA-DQ, the human homologue of H-2A, also influence responsiveness to MAM. Cells expressing DQw6 (HLA-DQA1*0103 and DQB1*0601 chains) were shown to give much higher MAM responses than did cells expressing DQw8 (DQA1*0301 and DQB1*0302 chains). In fact, responses of lymphocytes expressing DQB1*0601 chains were as high as those observed for cells expressing a functional H-2E molecule (56).

MAM causes elevated pro-inflammatory cytokine response in inbred C3H/HeJ mice, which carry a defect in the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4) and are highly susceptible to toxic shock (57). Variations in cytokine MAM responses between different mouse strains results from differential engagement of TLR-2 and TLR-4 (58) and subsequently differential regulation of B7-1 (57). Recently, MAM has been shown to have DNase activity (59). MAM has been crystallized in a trimeric complex with MHC class II and TCR and shows a very different structure and interactions compared with the prototype Sags (60, 61) (Fig. 4).

Yersinia pseudotuberculosis is a Gram-negative human pathogen that causes enteritis and mesenteric lymphadenitis. It carries three allelic variants of a Sag called Yersinia pseudotuberculosis Mitogen—YPM-A, YPM-B, and YPM-C. Like MAM, YPMs are not related to members of the staphylococcal/streptococcal Sag superfamily and lack the characteristic Prosite motifs (62, 63). The structure of YPM has been determined and reveals a jelly-roll like structure (64).

The genetic location of staphylococcal Sags and SSL genes PIs are mobile genetic segments that harbor many virulence genes. The first SaPIs were discovered because they carried the genes for TSST-1 and other superantigens (28, 65). Their mobility is based on their relationship with phage, and during growth of the temperate phage 80α, the SaPI containing the tst-1 gene is excised from its chromosomal attC site and replicates autonomously. It is efficiently encapsidated into special small phage heads that infect a recipient organism to integrate at the attC site by means of a self-coded integrase (28). The sequencing of several complete genomes has revealed several PIs, ranging in size from 14 to 17 kbp (27, 47). Sags that have been found encoded within PIs include SEB, SEC, SEL, SEK, SEQ, and TSST-1, with TSST-1 the most frequent. Most strains linked to menstrual TSS belong to a highly uniform agr group III clone of electrophoretic type (ET) 41, and a recent study has shown that the PI harboring tst1 is carried by most ET 41 strains, but has also disseminated to other strains that have been implicated in TSS (66). Comparison of chromosomal regions from different strains has revealed that the ssl genes are positionally conserved with ssl genes at equivalent positions in different strains representing allelic versions of each other (67).

The streptococcal superantigen genes

The majority of streptococcal sag genes are also located on mobile genetic elements, mostly on prophages. The only exceptions are smeZ, speG, and speJ (68), although spej might be located on an unstable chromosomal location because it is not found in all strains. The first evidence for a mobile sag gene was provided by Zabriskie (69), who showed the conversion of the non-lysogenic speA− strain T25₃ to a speA⁺ strain by the φT12 phage from the GAS strain T12g1. Comparative genomics confirmed that streptococcal sag genes are positioned on a variety of temperate phages and that related phages sometimes harbor different sag genes supporting the idea of recombinational evolution of GAS prophages (68, 70).

It has been shown recently that phage phi 149 from a STSS-producing strain encoding the sag gene ssa could induce lysogenic conversion for several clinical GAS isolates of various M serotypes, including M1, M3, M5, M12, M19, M28, and M94, via transfer of a recombinant phage phi 149. This finding indicated that horizontal phage transfer can occur across the M-type barrier. In addition, lysogenic conversion was also obtained for group C Streptococcus equisimilis isolates. This indicated that lysogeny between species is a mechanism for toxigenic conversion (71).

### Gene regulation

Regulation of streptococcal Sag gene expression

Most streptococcal Sags are negligibly expressed when grown in culture. However, there is increasing evidence of a significant upregulation after infection with host factors appearing to play a role in this process. Kazmi et al. (72) used micropore teflon diffusion chambers implanted subcutaneously in BALB/c mice and inoculated with a GAS strain that produced only small quantities of SPEA when grown in vitro. They observed a significant increase in SPEA production in the infected mice 7 days post-infection, and SPEA expression was still high after 21 in vitro passages of the isolate suggesting a stable switch of the speA gene. In another study, a lysogenic phage together with the phage-associated SPEC could be induced by co-culturing GAS with human pharyngeal cells (73). Musser and colleagues (74) have developed a genome-wide DNA microarray analysis to examine the expression of genes during infection. They showed that in a GAS serotype M1 strain grown in human blood, the transcription of speG, speJ, and smeZ was upregulated after 30 min (62-, 264-, and 52-fold, respectively) but down-regulated after 60 min. In contrast, speA was upregulated continuously reaching a 483-fold increase after 30 min and a

© 2008 The Authors • Journal compilation © 2008 Blackwell Munksgaard • Immunological Reviews 225/2008   2312139-fold increase after 90 min. Using the same methodology, this group also examined sag regulation during an 86-day infection protocol using cynomolgus macaques and correlated Sag expression with distinct GAS colonization/disease phases (75). speJ and smeZ transcription occurred during the colonization phase. However, speJ expression started at early infection stage and correlated with low GAS cell densities, whereas speA and smeZ transcripts increased at a later stage at higher cell densities. smeZ expression correlated with peak levels of C-reactive protein, an important inflammation marker. Furthermore, smeZ was the most dominant acute-phase-correlated pro-inflammatory gene, but it could not be correlated to animals with pharyngitis or tonsillitis, suggesting that SMEZ might play an important role in invasive GAS disease.

SPEB, a multifunctional cysteine protease may also play a role in the regulation of Sags at the protein level. Recent in vitro experiments have shown that SMEZ protein is degraded by recombinant SPEB, while SPEG and SPEA were more resistant and SPEJ was completely resistant (33). Further evidence for a key role of SPEB as regulator of Sags and other virulence factors was provided by Walker et al. (76), who demonstrated that in GAS the transition from local to systemic infection is linked to mutations in the two-component CovRS regulator. In these hypervirulent strains, SPEB expression is significantly decreased leading to the potential role of SPEB as a global regulator of Sag function through proteolysis (76).

Regulation of staphylococcal Sags and SSLs

Little is known about the regulation of staphylococcal Sags. Some Sags such as SEB are expressed at very high levels from some strains, but most of the staphylococcal Sags are expressed at very low levels under normal culture conditions. The best-known regulon in S. aureus is the agr (accessory gene regulator) system, a quorum-sensing system activated at high cell densities. Activation of agr results in the upregulation of most Sags but not SEA, which is constitutively expressed in strains carrying the sea gene. In addition, seb and tst-1 genes might be activated by the transcription factor SarA, but this point still remains controversial (77).

The regulation of the SSLs also appears to be tightly controlled with very little produced under normal in vitro culture conditions. However, there is a dramatic upregulation and secretion of SSLs under some forms of stress. Torres et al. (78) have shown high level expression of several SSLs in a hemin fed strain of S. aureus that is defective in the hrtAB (heme-regulated transporter) gene required for efflux of intracellular iron. This observation suggests that ssl genes are regulated by stress conditions caused by excess cytoplasmic iron. It was not

shown whether there was similar upregulation of Sag genes from other PIs.

An interesting finding has been made by Vojtov et al. (79), who suggest that some Sags, such as TSST-1 and SEB, have an autorepressor function. Expression of TSST-1 by S. aureus strongly suppressed the production of essentially all other secreted proteins acting at the level of transcription and also controlled its own synthesis by acting as an autorepressor. Similar global suppression effects were also been observed with secreted SEB (79).

### Structure

The structure of Sags

The three dimensional structures of 10 staphylococcal and seven streptococcal Sags have been solved by crystallography: staphylococcal toxins SEA (80), SEB (81), SEC2 (82), SEC3 (83), SED (84), SEG (85), SEH (86), SEI (87), SEK (88), and TSST-1 (89), and the streptococcal toxins SPEA (90), SPEC (91), SPEH (92), SPEI (93), SPEJ (94), SMEZ-2 (92), and SDM from S. dysgalactiae (95). In addition, the structures of MAM (61) and YPM (64) have also been determined.

All the structures (except MAM and YPM) reveal compact two domain globular proteins that range in size from 20 to 28 kDa. The N-terminal domain is a mixed β-barrel with Greek-key topology called an oligonucleotide OB-fold (96, 97). The OB domain is a common protein domain found in many other bacterial toxins such as the AB₅ toxin family, which includes cholera toxin and pertussis toxin, and in nucleases (92).

The larger C-terminal domain is a β-grasp fold consisting of a twisted β-sheet capped by the central α-helix. The C- and N-terminal domains are stabilized by close packing and are further stabilized by a section of the N-terminus that extends over the top of the C-terminal domain. The N-terminal extension contributes substantially to the TCR-binding site that is formed as a shallow depression between the two protein domains (Fig. 2). The Sags are noted for their impressive stability to denaturing conditions such as heat and acid and as a consequence are not completely destroyed by mild cooking of food, hence their potency in food poisoning. The β-grasp domain is formed by the central buried α4-helix that packs against a four strand antiparallel twisted sheet. The other side of the α4-helix packs against the inner side of the N-terminal OB-fold domain. The interface between the domains is the only highly conserved sequence among all members of both the Sags and the SSL families.

The Y. pseudotuberculosis superantigens YPM-A, YPM-B, and YPM-C are unrelated to the family of staphylococcal and streptococcal Sags by structure. The YPM-A polypeptide is a

Fig. 3. Multiple orientations of Sags on MHC. The staphylococcal and streptococcal Sags bind in two main orientations, either via their OB-domain to the MHC class II α-chain (blue), such as SEB (104) and TSST (105), or via the C-terminal zinc site to the MHC class II β-chain, such as SPEC (161). MAM binds in a very different mode. MAM consists of two α-helical bundles, one of which binds orthogonally to the top of MHC class II α1-helix, peptide, and β1-helix (61).

single domain with a jelly-roll fold comprising two β-sheets each containing four antiparallel strands (64). Interestingly, the closest structural relatives of YPM-A are viral capsid proteins and members of the TNF superfamily. Yet another different superantigen structure was discovered by crystal structure analysis of MAM. The MAM polypeptide comprises 10 α-helices forming an L-shaped protein fold (61) (Fig. 3). The structure of SDM from *S. dysgalactiae* is similar to the staphylococcal and streptococcal Sags, but a difference is the lack of the α5 helix between the β10 and β11 strands (95).

The structure of the SSLs
The structures of SSL7 (98), SSL5 (99), and SSL11 (52) have been determined, and all display a strongly conserved structural framework with the TSST-1 Sag structure (89). There are notable differences, however, in the overall structure between

SSLs and Sags (Fig. 2). Regions that support MHC class II binding and TCR binding in the Sags are completely changed in the SSLs. In addition, the SSLs commonly display an elongated β6-β7 loop creating a larger face on the C-terminal domain of the SSLs. Each of the SSLs has so far crystallized as a homodimer through this extended β6-β7 loop, but it is not known whether this ability to dimerize has any functional significance.

Sag binding to MHC class II and TCR
The notion that Sags simultaneously bind MHC class II and TCR is unrealistic. The superantigen must first bind to MHC class II to concentrate onto the surface of the APC, making use of the adhesion and accessory molecules that form the immunological synapse. Studies have shown that Sag binding to APCs is extremely stable, particularly those that utilize zinc in their class II β-chain binding sites, with the Sag remaining on the APC surface for up to 40 h without any evidence of depletion (100). At some early point after APC binding, the surface concentration is sufficient to successively engage and cross-link multiple TCR molecules, resulting in strong TCR signaling, activation, and rapid cytokine production. The affinity of Sags towards MHC class II molecules is thus typically 10 to 100-fold higher than its affinities towards TCR. Those Sag/TCR solution interactions that have been quantified typically exhibit the same affinity and binding rates as those measured for TCR/peptide MHC interactions (101).

MHC class II binding
One of the most interesting revelations is that Sags as a family have developed many ways of attaching themselves to MHC class II (Fig. 3). The variation in modes of binding is likely driven by a need to optimize the efficiency of individual Sags. The extraordinary amplification in T-cell signaling that is achieved by very stable binding to MHC class II means that far less Sag is required to achieve the desired effect. Good evidence supporting this idea comes from the simple observation that about four to five orders of magnitude less Sag is required to stimulate human peripheral blood lymphocytes than mouse peripheral blood lymphocytes, simply due to a slightly higher affinity toward human MHC class II. This observation has been proven in vivo with several studies showing mice that are transgenic for human MHC class II are significantly more sensitive in their T-cell proliferation responses, cytokine release, and toxicity to injected Sags compared with the non-transgenic littermates (102, 103).

Based on crystallographic data of Sags complexed with MHC class II, the interaction of Sags with MHC class II can be

classified into 4 groups (Fig. 3): (i) binding to MHC class II α-chain entirely peripheral to the bound antigen peptide (peptide-independent binding), e.g. HLA-DR/SEB (104); (ii) binding to MHC class II α-chain and extension over the bound peptide (peptide-dependent binding), e.g. HLA-DR/TSST-1 (105); (iii) zinc-mediated binding to MHC class II β-chain and extension over the bound peptide (peptide-dependent binding), e.g. HLA-DR2/SPEC (106), HLA-DR1/SEH (107), HLA-DR1/SEI (87); and (iv) Sags that combine both (i) and (ii) binding modes such as SEA to cross-link MHC class II (108, 109).

Sag binding to the α-chain of MHC class II is dictated by a short hydrophobic ridge in the N-terminal OB-domain that fits into the hydrophobic pocket formed along the distal α1-helix domain of MHC class II. The Sag binds to the top of the MHC class II molecule and out to the side in a wedge-like fashion between MHC class II and the TCR β-chain (104, 110). In this orientation, the TCR contacts both Sag and MHC so that the trimer is a combination of both TCR-Sag and TCR-MHC interactions (Fig. 3). The contacts made between TCR and MHC are not the same as those made during normal TCR engagement of peptide MHC (110). TSST-1 has a slight variation on this binding. Although it binds to the same site on the α-chain of MHC class II, it binds over the top of the molecule excluding any possible contact between MHC class II and TCR (105). The bound peptide has a significant role to play in both SEB and TSST-1 binding, explaining why there is no apparent competition between TSST-1 and SEB for APCs even though they both bind to the same location on MHC class II. Clearly those peptides which engage TSST-1 binding are not the same as those that engage SEB, so there is no competition between the two Sags for a shared binding site. No clear analysis has been done on exactly which peptides generate the highest binding affinity for TSST-1 versus SEB, but it is likely to significantly influence the link between MHC class II haplotype and an individual’s sensitivity to the toxic effects of TSST-1 or SEB (111).

Sags that bind the MHC class II β-domain (the SPEC model in Fig. 3) do so through a site in the C-terminal β-grasp domain and contain a zinc atom that forms a tetravalent metal complex between three residues in Sag with the conserved histidine 81 in the β-chain α-helix of MHC class II. The water molecule that normally forms the fourth ligand in the unbound Sag is displaced by the imidazole nitrogen of His81 to form a stable tetravalent coordination complex (106). Significantly, while the zinc complex is central to the binding interface, 25% of the contacts are made to the antigenic peptide within the class II molecule but predominantly with the peptide backbone atoms

rather than peptide side-chain atoms. These Sags achieve promiscuous binding to MHC class II by targeting conservatively substituted residues of the polymorphic β-chain. In addition, they circumvent peptide specificity by engaging MHC-bound peptides at their conformationally conserved N-terminal regions, while minimizing sequence-specific interactions with peptide residues to enhance cross-reactivity (87). Sags which have been shown or are believed on the basis of conservation of critical zinc binding residues to possess a β-chain binding zinc site are SEA, SED, SEE, SEH, SEI, SPE-C, SPE-G, SPE-H, SPE-I, SPE-J, SPE-K/L, SPE-L/M, SPE-M, and SMEZ. These are shown in red in Fig. 1.

TCR binding

Sags interact with TCR molecules by binding primarily to the variable region of the β-chain (Vβ-domain), resulting in oligoclonal stimulation of a defined T-cell repertoire, potentially activating >20% of all T cells. Crystal structures of Sags in complex with Vβ domains have revealed structurally diverse interactions, although binding to the TCR Vβ CDR2 loop seems to be a requirement for all bacterial Sags, whereas binding to other Vβ domain regions appears to result in Vβ domain specificity and crossreactivity of Sags (101). SEB, SEC, and SPEA engage the TCR Vβ chain through conformation-dependent mechanisms that are mainly independent of specific Vβ amino-acid site chains and are restricted to CDR2 and HV4 regions in the TCR (112). This results in a relatively low Vβ specificity, e.g. SEC-1 targets TCRs carrying human Vβ3.2, 6.4, 6.9, 12, and 15.1 domains. In contrast, SPEC mainly targets human Vβ2 and to a lesser extent Vβ12.5 and Vβ15.1. The increased specificity is achieved by engaging all Vβ hypervariable loops, including CDR1, CDR2, CDR3, and HV4 (113). In addition, residues on the CDR1 and CDR2 loops are involved in extensive intermolecular contacts. An even greater specificity is seen in TSST-1, which is highly specific for human Vβ2 T cells. This is caused by a unique interaction of TSST-1 with the TCR FR3 loop at the expense of binding to each of the hypervariable structures. Furthermore, TSST-1 targets a specific residue (Lys62) on the FR3 loop, and this interaction is required for T-cell stimulation (114). The crystal structure of SEK in complex with human Vβ5.1 revealed similar characteristics (88). SEK has an extended loop region (α3-β8 loop) with a specific residue that forms side chain-to-side chain hydrogen bonds with two relatively uncommon residues (Ser 63 and Asn 75) on the TCR Vβ 5.1 FR3 and FR4 regions. The α3-β8 loop region is also found in SEI (85), but its exact role in TCR-binding remains elusive. Another variation in the TCR-binding mechanism has been identified with SEH. In contrast to all other known staphylococcal Sag, SEH.

that SEs are able to penetrate the gut lining and activate a local and systemic immune response. It has been postulated that the release of inflammatory mediators, such as histamine and leukotriene, and neuroenteric peptide substance P upon SE stimulation might be responsible for the gastrointestinal tract damage, as the emetic response could be eliminated by H2-blockers and calcium channel blockers, which both also block the release of histamine (23).

It was also suggested that the production of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) by intestinal myofibroblasts (IMFs) might play a role in SEA food poisoning (120, 121). Cultured human IMFs were able to bind SEA in an MHC class II-dependent fashion, resulting in increased release of MCP-1 and the consequential production of IL-6 and IL-8. However, this mechanism fails to explain the emetic activity of other SEs, as it depended on the cross-linking of MHC class II molecules on IMFs by SEA, whereas incubation with SEB did not trigger a response. Hu et al. (122) postulated SEA-induced emesis through rapid serotonin release and showed in an animal model that SEA induces 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) in the intestine, rather than in the brain. Receptors on vagal afferent neurons are essential for SEA-triggered emesis.

### Diseases caused by Sags

#### TSS

TSS is an acute disorder arising from staphylococcal infection. The condition was first identified by Todd et al. (123) during a major outbreak in the US during the late 1970s, although it almost certainly existed well before its official classification. TSS is characterized by a very brief prodromal illness consisting of high fever, vomiting, diarrhea, conjunctivitis, headache, irritability, sore throat, myalgias, abdominal tenderness, and erythematous rash. The disorder can rapidly progress to hypotension, shock, respiratory distress syndrome, intravenous coagulation, severe thrombocytopenia, and renal failure. During convalescence, pronounced desquamation of the hands and feet occurs. Notably in TSS, staphylococcal cultures are rarely isolated from blood but are found at mucosal sites (vaginal or nasopharyngeal) or from a localized abscess. Almost all cases during the major US outbreak of the late 1970s were menstruating females who had urogenital tract infections by a phage group 1 strain of *S. aureus* (123). The outbreak was quickly linked to the use of the high absorbency Rely tampon from Procter & Gamble (124). Bergdoll et al. (4) showed that 94% of confirmed menstrual TSS isolates produced high levels of TSST-1 compared with 4% for non-TSS strains. A marked reduction in the incidence of menstrual TSS resulted once the Rely tampon was removed from the market (125). Sporadic

recognizes the variable region of the TCR α-chain (Vα 27), which was shown by BIAcore® real time binding studies (115). A direct contact with the TCR α-chain has also been observed in the crystal structure of MAM in complex with HLA-DR1 bound to a hemagglutinin peptide (HA) and the murine single-chain TCR T7 derived from mouse CD8⁺ clone 2C (60). The structure, which is the first crystal structure of a ternary complex with MHC class II, Sag, and TCR, showed that MAM acts as a bridge between MHC class II and the TCR. Consequently, the TCR interacting with MAM does not make any contacts with the MHC class II and the associated peptide.

The basis for enterotoxic activity

The staphylococcal enterotoxins are potent gastrointestinal toxins responsible for staphylococcal food poisoning. Ingestion of < 1 μg of SE is sufficient to trigger nausea, emesis, abdominal pain or cramping, and diarrhea after a short incubation period of approximately 4 h (116). Attempts to separate the enterotoxin activity from the Sag activity have yielded inconclusive results (117). A highly flexible disulfide loop within the N-terminal domain has been implicated with the emetic activity but does not appear to be an absolute requirement (118).

Patients with acute SE intoxications show gastrointestinal damage and an influx of polymorphonuclear blood cells into the lamina propria and epithelium. Shupp et al. (119) have shown
cases of non-menstrual TSS continue to occur worldwide but are less likely to be exclusive to TSST-1-producing strains. Toxins involved in non-menstrual TSS include other SEs, in particular SEA, SEB, and SEC, whereas Sag encoded on the enterotoxin gene cluster (egc), SEG, SEI, SEM, SEN, and SEO, appear to be associated with suppurative infections (126, 127).

The majority (88%) of cases of menstrual TSS have been attributed to a single clone of S. aureus isolated across five countries and two continents. This clone can also be isolated from the urogenital tract of asymptomatic women, suggesting that it is particularly well adapted to survival in this location (128). The tst-1 gene resides in a separate PI (SaPIn1) from the other sag genes, and it is most likely that its expression is under different regulation that allows it to be produced in very large amounts under conditions unique to the urogenital tract. In addition, it has been proposed that TSST-1, unlike other Sags, has the capacity to directly bind vaginal epithelial cells and activates several innate chemokines that may assist in its penetration into the blood stream (129).

STSS

A more acute condition is caused by Streptococcus pyogenes, called STSS. The symptoms are almost identical to TSS with one significant difference: the fatality rate is typically much higher for STSS (~30%) than TSS (~5%) (8, 130). Typically an outwardly healthy young patient presents on admission with severe headache, fever, myalgias, and arthralgia and is found to be hypotensive. Progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome is often rapid. Similar to TSS, blood cultures are often negative, and it is usually found that S. pyogenes has entered through a small cut and developed as internal foci.

While the rates in the Western world of TSS have remained relatively static since the tampon-related outbreak in the late 1970s, the incidence of invasive streptococcal infection and STSS has seen a marked rise (8). The cause of this has not been determined, and several studies have attempted to identify a limited clonotypic profile for this disease but without success. In a recent study from Denmark (131) covering 496 cases of STSS spanning 1999–2002, 47 different emm types were identified but with emm1 predominating. A high proportion of isolates carried speA, although the frequency decreased from 94% to 71% over the 3 years. In contrast, the emm1-specific prevalence of speC increased from 25% to 53%. Recently, several unrelated cases of STSS have been shown to be caused by SMEZ (42, 132).

Atopic dermatitis

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a genetically determined, chronic, relapsing, and highly pruritic inflammatory disease that affects more than 10% of children. A typical characteristic of AD is the infiltration of T cells, monocytes/macrophages, and eosinophils into the skin lesions (133). The first evidence that S. aureus might play a role in AD was provided by Leyden et al. (134), who showed that the skin of most patients with AD was colonized, whereas only about 5% of healthy subjects carry S. aureus on their skin. Furthermore, the patients responded rapidly to antibiotic treatment. S. aureus counts between lesional skin and non-lesional skin in AD patients differ by more than 1000-fold. Later it was shown that the majority of S. aureus isolates from AD skin produced Sag (135–137), suggesting a direct involvement of Sag in the disease mechanism. Sags have the capacity to activate and expand T cells expressing specific TCR BV gene segments and also to increase their skin-homing capacity via upregulation of the skin-homing receptor, cutaneous lymphocyte-associated antigen (CLA). In another study, Sag-secreting S. aureus strains were identified in six of 12 AD patients, and all of these subjects manifested significant Sag-appropriate Vβ skewing within the CLA⁺ subsets of both their CD4⁺ and their CD8⁺ T cells. TCR Vβ skewing was not detectable among the overall CD4⁺ or CD8⁺ T-cell subsets of these subjects and was not present within the CLA⁺ T-cell subsets of patients with plaque psoriasis and normal controls (138). This finding suggests that Sags are able to increase the frequency of memory T cells able to migrate and be activated within AD lesions and thereby contribute to the pathogenesis of AD. In a murine model of AD, where mice were topically exposed to SEB, Savinko et al. (139) demonstrated that the Sag provoked epidermal accumulation of CD8⁺ T cells, a mixed T-helper 1 (Th1)/Th2-type dermatitis and vigorous production of specific IgE and IgG2a antibodies, which was related to the chronic phase of AD.

Allergic rhinitis

The development of allergic rhinitis is influenced by a number of different factors, including smoking, air pollution, hormones, stress, and alcohol. As with AD, a role for staphylococal Sags has recently been suggested. It has been reported that the nasal carriage of S. aureus was higher in patients with perennial allergic rhinitis (44%) than in control subjects (20%). There was an even more significant association with Sag-producing S. aureus (22% versus 6.7% in control subjects) (140). Rossi and Monasterolo (141) analyzed the prevalence of serum-specific IgE towards SEA, SEB, SEC, SED, and TSST-1 in dust mite-allergic patients with allergic rhinitis and found an increase in serum eosinophil cationic protein (ECP, a reliable marker of clinical severity of allergic disease) in patients with anti-Sag IgE compared with IgE-negative patients. This
observation pointed to an involvement of Sags in local IgE
production and a Th2-type biased eosinophil inflammation.
Further evidence was obtained from animal experiments with
BALB/c mice that were intranasally sensitized with Schistosoma
mansoni egg antigen (SmEA) in the presence or absence of SEB.
Nasal exposure to SEB resulted in enhanced development of
allergic rhinitis in SmEA-sensitized mice, shown by SmEA-specific
IgE production, nasal eosinophilia, and IL-4 and IL-5 production
by nasal mononuclear cells after antigen challenge (142). IgEs
specific to SEA, SEB, SEC, SED, and TSST-1 have also been reported
in the serum of patients with allergic rhinitis and asthma, and IgE
levels were correlated with disease severity (141, 143). Involvement of staphylococcal Sags in other airway diseases, such as nasal
polyps, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and early
childhood wheezing, has also been examined (144).

Susceptibility factors
S. aureus is a common Gram-positive organism that colonizes the
skin and nares of approximately 30% of the general population.
S. pyogenes is commonly found in the throat. Under normal
circumstances, the numbers of bacteria are too low to produce
toxic levels of Sags. However, enough is produced to generate
toxin-specific antibodies that are ultimately protective for most
people throughout life. Testing of normal adolescent sera
reveals widespread seroconversion to many of the common
staphylococcal and streptococcal Sags, indicating that exposure
to a range of strains begins very early in life. Those who do not
develop anti-toxin antibodies are at increased risk of their toxic
effects. Absence of serum neutralization was first shown to be a
strong susceptibility factor in TSS, with a high proportion of
menstrual related TSS patients having no serum neutralizing
antibodies to TSST-1 (145). Moreover, anti-TSST-1 antibodies
developed during the convalescent phase of the illness, suggesting that these patients had simply not been previously
exposed to TSST-1 rather than having an inability to make anti-
TSST-1-specific antibodies. A recent study has revealed that
serum from healthy subjects contained TSST-1-binding antibodies of the IgG and IgM class; however, only IgG1 and IgG4
antibodies had neutralizing capacity. Healthy individuals infected vaginally with S. aureus lacked TSST-1-binding IgG1
antibodies and neutralizing anti-TSST-1 antibodies in all of the
acute phases and in most of the convalescent sera, suggesting a
lack of ability to generate a neutralizing response to TSST-1
(146). The importance of anti-toxin antibodies as a major
susceptibility factor has also been shown for STSS. The potent
streptococcal Sag SMEZ appears to be the principal cause in
many cases of acute STSS. Acutely ill patients with suspected
STSS have shown no serum neutralizing activity towards SMEZ

but developed a neutralizing response specifically to SMEZ
during the convalescent phase (42, 132).

MHC class II as a susceptibility factor
Another susceptibility factor for Sag-mediated disease is the
genetic background of the host, in particular HLA polymorphism.
For example, SPEA triggers significantly higher proliferative
responses when presented by HLA-DQ compared with HLA-
DR1, -DR4, or -DR5 alleles. In contrast, SPEC was preferentially
presented by HLA-DR4 (147). Moreover, significantly reduced
responses to streptococcal Sags were observed in patients with
the DRB1*1501/DQB1*0602 haplotype, and these patients
were less likely to develop severe systemic disease compared
with individuals with risk or neutral haplotypes (111). Llewelyn et al. (148) showed that polymorphism in the DQ α-chain
affected binding of SPEA to HLA-DQ, resulting in quantitative
and qualitative differences in the cytokine responses. The
importance of HLA polymorphism in Sag binding has also been
demonstrated in transgenic mouse models. HLA-DQ8 but not
HLA-DR transgenic mice were highly sensitive to SPEA in vitro
and in vivo and exhibited increased mortality after administration
of SPEA or infection with GAS (103). Furthermore, spleen cells
isolated from HLA-DQ transgenic mice expressing HLA-DQ-
B1*0302 responded better to SMEZ-13 compared with spleen
cells from HLA-DR1 transgenic mice (41). Similar experiments
by Nooh et al. (102) demonstrated that when splenocytes from
transgenic mice expressing the protective HLA-DQB1*06
(DQ6) allele were stimulated with a mixture of streptococcal
Sags, secreted by the prevalent GAS M1T1 strain, both proliferative and cytokine responses were significantly lower than
those of splenocytes from mice expressing the neutral
DRB1*0402/DQB1*0302 (DR4/DQ8) alleles.

Therapeutic interventions
Intravenous Ig therapy
Several studies have shown that lack of protective antibodies
against staphylococcal and streptococcal Sag is a risk factor for
TSS and STSS (149–151). Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG)
consists of antibodies pooled from several thousand donors
and exhibits high polyspecificity. IVIG has neutralized Sag
activity in cell culture supernatant from clinical GAS and
S. aureus isolates (152) as well as recombinant streptococcal Sag
(153, 154). A comparative study using cell culture supernatants showed that IVIG was more potent in inhibiting
streptococcal Sags than staphylococcal Sags (152). Documentation of the clinical efficacy of IVIG in STSS includes several case
reports, two observational cohort studies, one case-control
study, and one multicenter placebo-controlled trial (149).
IVIG is usually given in high doses (1–2 g/kg body weight), and it is believed that the majority of Sags are completely inhibited by a wide range of different IVIG preparations. However, little is known about the regulation of sag expression, and several studies have reported a significant upregulation of sag genes in infection models (see paragraph on regulation). In particular, the increased expression of SMEZ during a cynomolgus macaques infection model (75) is notable, as some of the SMEZ variants, e.g. SMEZ-2, exhibit very low LD₅₀ values. It has also been shown that the efficacy of IVIG to neutralize streptococcal Sags varies between different preparations (154).

The use of IVIG as adjunctive therapy in TSS might also be hindered by the fact that Sags appear to have a very rapid turnover rate in the patient’s blood. To date, bioactive Sags were found in serum samples of only two patients with STSS. One patient died on the day of hospital admission, while the Sag activity was cleared from the blood of the second patient within one day of admission (42). Thus, IVIG therapy might only be beneficial if applied very early after the onset of toxic shock symptoms.

### Peptide antagonists

To exhibit mitogenic activity, the Sag must bind to both its receptors, MHC class II and TCR. Any disruption of either binding mechanism would result in loss of superantigenicity. In an attempt to generate antagonists to SEB, Kaempfer and colleagues (155) synthesized short peptides derived from various SEB domains. They found a dodecapeptide that weakly antagonized SEB activity. A modified version of this peptide was a more powerful antagonist that inhibited the activity of SEB and TSST-1 in a murine infection model (155). The exact mechanism of how this peptide interferes with SEB function is not known. The SEB domain from where the peptide is derived is not involved in either MHC class II or TCR binding but is highly conserved in staphylococcal and streptococcal Sags. More recently, the validity of Sag peptide antagonists has been questioned (156, 157). Sag peptide antagonists failed to block T-cell activation and cytokine production as well as toxic shock induced by staphylococcal SEB in HLA class II transgenic mice. The authors argue that the use of wildtype mice would give unreliable results, as they are resistant to Sag-induced toxic shock even at very high doses, and pretreatment with sensitizing agents, such as D-galactosamine or bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), is mandatory. They also failed to inhibit the binding of SEB to HLA class II molecules as well as activation of human T lymphocytes in vitro.

Designed receptor mimics

In a more direct approach, Lehnert et al. (158) designed a bispecific receptor mimic that targeted both the MHC class II binding and the TCR-binding site of Sags. Their construct consisted of a HLA-DR1 α1 subunit connected via a peptide linker to the variable β-chain of the TCR. Several chimeric receptor mimics with different TCRVβ regions were designed to target a number of different Sags. For example, human Vβ3 was used for SEB-specific chimera, human Vβ2 was used for TSST-1-specific chimera, and an analogue of murine Vβ8.2 was used for SEC3-specific chimera (159). In a cell proliferation assay, 20 times excess of chimera over SEB showed 30% inhibition, whereas 40% inhibition was achieved with chimeras against SEC3 and TSST-1.

In an attempt to improve the efficacy of TCR antagonists, Buonpane et al. (160) have used yeast display libraries of random and site-directed human Vβ8 mutants to improve domain stability for higher affinity binding to SEB. Affinity maturations were generated in CDR2 and FR3 residues, yielding improvements in affinity of greater than 10 000-fold (Kd = 180 pmol). In a rabbit model, the high affinity anti-SEB Vβ receptor antagonist was able to prevent SEB toxicity, even well after SEB had been injected (160).

What are superantigens doing for the bug?

After 18 years of intensive research, the question of why bacteria produce Sags remains unanswered. However, it is almost certainly not to induce systemic toxic shock in the host. The most likely role of Sags is during the early stages of infection when the very low levels of Sag activate only local T cells. At this stage, the host response to *S. aureus* or *S. pyogenes* infection is entirely dependent on myeloid cells such as neutrophils and macrophages that are rapidly drawn to and engulf the invading bacteria, triggered by inflammatory mediators and Fc receptor and complement-mediated mechanisms. One possible advantage of T-cell activation at the infection site might be to produce cytokines such as IL-2, IFN-γ, and TNF-α that suppress local inflammation. While there is no direct evidence that Sags directly enhance colonization, an experiment from Vojtov et al. (79) revealed a remarkable difference in local inflammation in hairless mice subcutaneously injected with a TSST-1 producing strain of *S. aureus* compared with an isogenic knockout strain. After 4 days, mice injected with the tst⁺ strain produced no significant inflammatory lesion, while the tst⁻ knockout strain produced a purulent open abscess characteristic of a subcutaneous *S. aureus* infection. The authors suggested that this outcome was due to the global regulatory effect of TSST on the expression of other staphylococcal

exoproteins, but alternatively the lack of an inflammatory response may have been caused by T-cell activation and suppression of innate mechanisms.

**Closing remarks**

There is much that we have learned over the years about the mechanism of Sags and their role in disease. We now understand a great deal about their structure and how they operate at the molecular level, but the most important question of why they are produced by the bacteria remains to be answered. *S*. aureus and *S*. pyogenes are two organisms that continue to plague mankind, causing severe morbidity and mortality worldwide. The study of Sags has extended our knowledge about the virulence and pathogenicity of these two organisms and how these organisms defend against host immunity.
