## I. GalAG Biopolymers  

### A. Introduction  

The glycosaminoglycan (GAG) family of structurally complex linear polysaccharides is composed of four chemically distinct subsets: the heparin and heparan sulfate (HS) GAGs, the chondroitin and dermatan sulfate (CS and DS, respectively) GAGs, keratan sulfate (KS), and hyaluronic acid (*Ernst et al.*, 1995). The following material focuses on GAGs of the CS and DS type, also known as galactosaminoglycans (GalAGs). Covered herein are the most prominent details concerning GalAG structure, their roles in biology and medicine, GalAG biosynthesis, their *in vivo* cellular degradation, and analytical biotechnologies pertinent to the study of GalAGs (*Fig.* 1).

The study of biological phenomena, from the molecular to the tissue level, has evolved substantially as scientists have focused on the emerging

paradigm of extracellular regulation of cell function. GAG polysaccharides are attached to a protein core and are impelled to the cell surface and into the extracellular space. The cell surface machinery at the cell–extracellular matrix (ECM) interface acts as a complex battery of regulators that dynamically modulates outside cues from diverse signaling molecules. Specifically, GAGs govern signaling molecules by controlling their effective concentration and state at the cell surface.

# B. Composition and Chemical Complexity

GalAGs are composed of a disaccharide repeat unit of uronic acid [$\alpha$-L-iduronic acid (IdoA) or $\beta$-D-glucuronic acid (GlcA)] (1$\rightarrow$3) linked to N-acetyl-D-galactosamine (GalNAc). These basic disaccharide units are linearly associated via $\beta$(1$\rightarrow$4) linkages to form GalAG polymers (Fig. 2). In CS, all of the uronic acid moieties are GlcA. In DS, epimerization at the C-5 position of the uronic acid moiety during biosynthesis results in a mixture of IdoA and GlcA epimers. Biosynthesis of CS and DS also involves chemical modification of the sugar backbone at various positions, generating diversity in oligosaccharide sequences. CS is commonly O-sulfated at the C-4 of the galactosamine (chondroitin-4-sulfate, C4S, also known as CS-A) or the C6 of the galactosamine (chondroitin-6-sulfate, C6S, also known as CS-C). Less common modifications in CS, such as 2-O- or 3-O-sulfation of the GlcA moiety, have also been reported (Nadanaka and Sugahara, 1997; Sugahara et al., 1996). DS (also known as CS-B) is commonly O-sulfated at C-4 of GalNAc; O-sulfation at C-6 of GalNAc and C-2 of IdoA also occasionally occur.

The various backbone modifications in GAG biopolymers confer infinitely more chemical complexity when compared to DNA and proteins. Theoretically, the five different modifications possible for each disaccharide unit give rise to $2^5 = 32$ chemical combinations. In comparison, DNA is composed of only four basic building blocks, and proteins are made up of 20 amino acids. This vast complexity makes these biopolymers among the most information-rich in nature.

# C. Structural Features

GAGs are distinguished from other polysaccharides as a distinct class by their related backbone moieties. Modification of these backbone elements confers great diversity among GAGs. The heterogeneity of GAG sequences is notable, especially when compared to other biopolymers like DNA and proteins. The template-based biosynthesis of these molecules has greatly facilitated their study; in contrast, the nontemplate-driven biosynthesis of complex polysaccharides has largely suppressed attempts at their analysis. DS is predominantly 4-O-sulfated. Iduronic acid content of DS is variable and has been reported as low as 7% and as high as 93%, depending on tissue origin and the method of compositional analysis (Linhardt et al., 1991; Maimone and Tollefsen, 1990; Poole, 1986). In CS, copolymers with both 4-O- and 6-O-sulfation in the same chain occur often (Ernst et al., 1995). Individual CS residues sometimes are sulfated at both the 4-O- and 6-O-positions (Linhardt et al., 1991). Two levels of organization have been described for GalAGs. Macroscopically, clustering of residues in DS results in regions with IdoA and a high degree of sulfation interspersed with regions

FIGURE 2 Galactosaminoglycan chemical structure. Biopolymers of the chondroitin sulfate and dermatan sulfate type are composed of a basic building block, a disaccharide consisting of an uronic acid β(1→3) linked to GalNAc. These disaccharide units are linearly associated via β(1→4) linkages. In the case of CS, all of the uronic acid moieties correspond to the glucuronic acid epimerization state. For DS, modification of the uronic acid C5 position during biosynthesis leads to a mixture of epimers within the chain. Common sulfation patterns within the oligosaccharide backbones are indicated for each GalAG form. Additionally, CS-A and CS-C are sometimes sulfated at the 2-O- or 3-O-positions of GlcA. The CS-B form is also known as DS. DS occasionally incorporates O-sulfation at GalNAc C6.
with GlcA and a lower degree of sulfation (Fransson *et al.*, 1990). Sulfation at the 6-O-position of CS often seems to be clustered near the chain termini (Cheng *et al.*, 1992). Microscopically, specific sequences of GAGs are functionally relevant. Rare residues can, in fact, have critical physiological functions. A specific DS hexasaccharide, for instance, has a specific affinity for heparin cofactor II (Maimone and Tollefsen, 1990). These two levels of organization, therefore, are important in modulating the physical form of GAGs and in regulating the specific interaction between a GAG and another biomolecule. Form is also a function of the ionic environment, which can shield repulsive ionic forces between charged chains.

In solution, CS seems to exist in defined spatial orientations; DS has a flexible conformation (Casu *et al.*, 1988; Venkataraman *et al.*, 1994). A central issue, a controversial one, regarding the structural diversity of GAGs is the conformational flexibility of the iduronate residue (Ferro *et al.*, 1990; Mitra *et al.*, 1983; Venkataraman *et al.*, 1994; Winter *et al.*, 1986). The four main conformers of IdoA are ${}^{1}\mathrm{C}_{4}$, ${}^{4}\mathrm{C}_{1}$, ${}^{2}\mathrm{T}_{0}$, and ${}^{0}\mathrm{T}_{2}$. These conformers for IdoA are stereochemically satisfactory and are consistent with the available physico-chemical data. Interconversion between IdoA puckers may generate chain conformational flexibility, facilitating interaction with proteins (Casu *et al.*, 1986).

Rotary shadowing/electron microscopy studies have revealed that C6S is capable of forming aggregates of two or more chains (Scott *et al.*, 1992). The charge distribution of the twofold helix of C6S is near the periphery, creating regions of hydrophobicity. Such hydrophobic zones from separate chains can interact with each other. Chondroitin-4-sulfate is incapable of such network formation, as sulfate groups are clustered close to the helical axis, minimizing aggregation behavior. Although C4S cannot self-aggregate, it is capable of association with DS. Alternating IdoA and GlcA in DS can self-associate in the absence of divalent cations under physiological conditions (Fransson and Coster, 1979). Chemical modification of the sugar backbone, hydrogen bonding, and cation chelation are critical determinants of self-aggregation potential and solid-state structural conformation, necessary for conferring the biological information inherent in GAG biomolecules.

## D. GalAG Proteoglycans

GalAGs’ chains, as with all other members of the GAG family with the exception of hyaluronic acid, occur as constituents of proteoglycans (PGs) (Table I) (Iozzo, 1998). As such, they are attached, via a glycosidic linkage, to a serine residue in a core protein through a tetrasaccharide composed of glucuronic acid-galactose-galactose-xylose. Core proteins can range in size from 10 to 500 kDa. CS is usually found in large aggregating PGs with 20–100 sidechains; DS occurs primarily in smaller PGs with 2–8 sidechains (Poole, 1986). Overall PG size ranges from 80 to 3500 kDa

E. GalAGs in Biology

Long thought of as inert structural components, GAGs have in recent years come to the forefront in the thinking of bioscientists as important modulators of biological phenomena. Polysaccharide structure governs

myriad interactions between powerful biological players, imparting effects on cell function in both normal and aberrant pathophysiological states. Interactions between proteins and heparin/HS GAGs, and more recently GalAG polymers, have shed considerable light on basic biological functions. Further, the implications of these biomolecular interactions reverberate in importance through the entire cascade of biomedical events, from fundamental biological phenomena to clinical biomedicine.

## II. GalAGs in the Extracellular Matrix

The ECM is a highly heterogeneous mixture of proteins, saccharides, and other biomolecules that surrounds cells. The ECM is instrumental in providing the physical support necessary for macromolecular organization into tissues and organs. Traditionally, the ECM was considered to be solely an inert scaffold providing structure. This conventional view has been overturned, and it has become apparent that the ECM is in fact a fundamental player in orchestrating cellular responses, both in normal and disease states.

GAGs are among the most important constituents of the ECM, as they interact with transient ECM molecules, such as growth factors, often resulting in a cascade of bioregulatory events including signal transduction and nuclear transcriptional phenomena (Kovanen and Pentikainen, 1999; Olsson *et al.*, 1999). These interactions impart profound implications on the type and strength of signaling in gene expression. The specialized functions elicited by GAG activity *in vivo* emphasize the importance of structural (and sequence) diversity among GAGs. In addition to binding heparin cofactor II (Tovar *et al.*, 2005), GalAGs also appear to be involved in a variety of processes, including the covalent crosslinking of the blood protein pre-α-inhibitor (Enghild *et al.*, 1991), infectivity mechanisms (Achur *et al.*, 2000; Alkhalil *et al.*, 2000; Schmidtchen *et al.*, 2001), and tenascin-X binding (Elefteriou *et al.*, 2001). GAGs are found in the ECM bound to structural proteins (including collagen, laminin, and fibronectin), aggregated with other PGs, or as constituents of integral membrane PGs (Hardingham and Fosang, 1992).

## III. GalAG–Protein Interactions

GAGs bind a wide variety of ECM, intracellular, and plasma proteins (Table II) (Cardin and Weintraub, 1989; Frevert *et al.*, 2003; Garcia-Olivas *et al.*, 2003; Jackson *et al.*, 1991; Marino *et al.*, 2003; Murai *et al.*, 2004; Priglinger *et al.*, 1994; Proudfoot *et al.*, 2001; Schmidtchen *et al.*, 2001). Requirements for GAG–protein binding include sequence specificity within the oligosaccharide chain and, in many cases, a region of enriched basic amino acids for the protein (Cardin and Weintraub, 1989; Prabhakar *et al.*,

Since the protein is more rigid than the saccharide, it is likely that a given GAG molecule imparts some level of conformational flexibility that facilitates the interaction (Grootenhuis *et al.*, 1994; Ornitz *et al.*, 1995; Thompson *et al.*, 1994; Venkataraman *et al.*, 1994).

## IV. GalAGs in Biomedicine

### A. Cell Signaling and Cancer

Although there has long been a dedicated exploration of HS involvement in signaling, only recently have GalAGs emerged as central players. The GalAG constituents of PGs are critical regulators of growth factor and cytokine signaling (Table II) (Brooks *et al.*, 2000; Hildebrand *et al.*, 1994; Stacey *et al.*, 2003; Wisniewski *et al.*, 2005). Further, GalAG chains are central to a variety of interactions modulating ECM-mediated cell-to-cell signaling. For example, chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) on neutrophils specifically bind to platelet factor 4 and are responsible for cellular activation (Petersen *et al.*, 1998, 1999). Interactions of DS chains with fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) and keratinocyte growth factor have been characterized with respect to cellular proliferation and wound repair (Trowbridge and Gallo, 2002; Trowbridge *et al.*, 2002). DS is additionally capable of activating the hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor signaling pathway through the c-met receptor (Catlow *et al.*, 2003; Lyon *et al.*, 1998, 2002). The same signaling cascade can promote cell proliferation through endocan, a PG composed of both CS and DS sidechains (Bechard *et al.*, 2001). CS and DS chains found in the PG versican bind L-selectin, P-selectin, and chemokines, significant in leukocyte trafficking and inflammatory disease (Kawashima *et al.*, 2002; Kinsella *et al.*, 2004; Lesley *et al.*, 1997; Sheng *et al.*, 2005; Sugahara *et al.*, 2003).

Dermatan sulfate proteoglycans (DSPGs) play an active role both in modulating ECM integrity and cellular signaling processes, and it therefore follows that DS has also been implicated in oncogenesis and angiogenesis (Nelimarkka *et al.*, 2001). GAG-degrading enzymes led to a decrease in cell proliferation and invasion of melanoma or endothelial cells (Denholm *et al.*, 2001) and to a reduction in FGF-2 responsiveness (a known regulator of tumor cell proliferation) in human dermal fibroblasts (Denholm *et al.*, 2000; Liu *et al.*, 2002). GAG modulation of tumor growth and dissemination has revealed a regulatory layer of tumorigenesis governed by GAG crosstalk with various oncogenic agents (Sanderson *et al.*, 2004; Yang *et al.*, 2005).

B. Coagulation

DS selectively activates heparin cofactor II, an important member of the serpin family of proteins, resulting in the inactivation of thrombin without an accompanying interaction with antithrombin III (Liaw *et al.*, 1999, 2001; Maimone and Tollefsen, 1990, 1991; Mascellani *et al.*, 1993; Nenci, 2002; Tollefsen *et al.*, 1989). An oversulfated DS hexasaccharide, (IdoA2S-GalNAc4S)₃, binds heparin cofactor II with high affinity, producing as much as a 100-fold increase in heparin cofactor II-mediated inhibition of thrombin (Casu *et al.*, 2004; Maimone and Tollefsen, 1991; Mascellani *et al.*, 1993). Sequence specificity of the DS oligosaccharide is critical, as a DS hexasaccharide with two repeats of the disaccharide sequence, IdoA-GalNAc4S, 6S, can also mediate heparin cofactor II activation but a hexasaccharide with the sequence IdoA2S-GalNAc6S cannot (Denti *et al.*, 1995; Ernst *et al.*, 1995; Trowbridge and Gallo, 2002). Thus, it is plausible that heparin cofactor II activation through a GalAG polymer requires a specific epimerization state (IdoA) and a precise sulfation pattern (GalNAc4S).

Heparin also activates heparin cofactor II through a chain length-dependent mechanism (Liaw *et al.*, 1999), resulting in a far higher increase (1000-fold) in antithrombin activity when compared to DS-mediated phenomena. The action of DS regarding coagulation is distinct from heparin, as DS behaves as a selective thrombin inhibitor. Heparin acts on the coagulation system through a template-based mechanism, involving complex formation with the simultaneous binding of heparin to thrombin and the GAG-binding domain of heparin cofactor II. Interaction of DS with heparin cofactor II is capable of inactivating thrombin bound to fibrin on the surface of an injured vessel (Bendayan *et al.*, 1994). This outcome cannot be achieved through heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycans (HSGAGs).

A variety of DS-based anticoagulant therapies have been developed. These include GAG mixtures, including mesoglycan, danaparoid, and sulodexide, which contain both DS and HSGAGs, and intimitan, a semisynthetic oversulfated DS. Intimitan contains an increased content of the IdoA-GalNAc4S,6S disaccharide and more effectively inhibits clot-bound thrombin than standard heparin or DS therapies (Buchanan and Brister, 2000; Buchanan *et al.*, 2001; Coccheri *et al.*, 2002a,b; Harenberg, 1998; Nenci, 2002; Nenci *et al.*, 2001; Ofosu, 1998). DS-based therapeutics are being developed for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, a disorder resulting from an autoimmune response to a complex of heparin and platelet factor 4 in which heparin treatment must be discontinued (Imberti *et al.*, 2003; Taliani *et al.*, 1999). Novel anticoagulants composed of complexes of GAGs, and heparin cofactor II are also under investigation (Fernandez *et al.*, 1999; Monagle *et al.*, 1998).

C. Cartilage Function and Osteoarthritis

Degenerative joint disease or osteoarthritis is characterized by the breakdown of cartilage. Cartilage, composed of up to 90% ECM, serves to essentially cushion the ends of bones. The disease affects more than 20 million Americans and becomes more prevalent on aging. CS is the predominant GAG present in cartilage ECM (Hardingham and Fosang, 1992; Iozzo, 1997; Tumova et al., 2000). The high overall charge of the chemical groups present on CS chains in cartilage PGs are believed to provide the necessary electrostatic forces to promote high-water content, enabling joints to withstand dynamic mechanical compression (Ragan et al., 2000). PG core proteins also interact with the collagen fibrils present in cartilage, thus imparting additional mechanical integrity. These and other biological roles are achieved through a variety of CS-containing PGs, including aggrecan (Plaas et al., 2001; Watanabe et al., 1998), decorin, biglycan, and perlecans (Table I) (Kinsella et al., 2004; Knudson and Knudson, 2001; Reed et al., 2005; Wadhwa et al., 2004). Cartilage degradation in osteoarthritis proceeds both through mechanical forces at play in the joint and with the enzymatic degradation of critical cartilage ECM components. Chondrocytes are largely responsible for regulating ECM molecules, and the aberrant behavior of these cells results in pathogenesis (Ragan et al., 2000). Arthritic tissues have been observed to carry GAG pattern profiles, most notably a decrease in the abundance of 6-O-sulfated disaccharides accompanying an increase in 4-O-sulfated CS disaccharides (Plaas et al., 1998). The development of nutraceuticals (including chondroitin, glucosamine, and mannosamine) to treat osteoarthritis has been controversial.

D. Neurobiology

The neurons and glia of the central nervous system express a wide variety of PGs that impinge upon diverse processes, including the migration of neural precursor cells, control of neuronal tracking, the regulation of neuronal cell adhesion molecules, and the formation of synapses (Edgell et al., 2004; Hartmann and Maurer, 2001; Iwata and Carlson, 1991; Monnier et al., 2003; Oohira et al., 2000, 2004). Through these processes, PGs of nervous system origin play an essential role during neural development (Deepa et al., 2004; Lander et al., 1997; Lee et al., 2004; Saunders et al., 1997; Umehara et al., 2004; Williams et al., 1994). CSPGs are particularly abundant in brain tissue. The signal transducing receptor-type protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTPξ) and phosphacan are CSPGs involved in neuron–glial cell interaction, gliogenesis, neuronal migration, and neurite outgrowth (Table II) (Holland et al., 1998; Margolis and Margolis, 1993). Maintenance of long-term potentiation is repressed in mice deficient in the CSPGs neurocan and brevican (Beggah et al., 2005; Blakemore et al., 2002; Hayashi et al., 2005; Johnson

et al., 2005; Mishima and Hoffman, 2003; Popp et al., 2003; Schumacher et al., 1997; Zhang et al., 2003). The absence of CSPGs is in some notable cases (as with PTPζ, neurocan, and brevican) compensated for by other lecticans (Brakebusch et al., 2002; Harroch et al., 2000; Rauch et al., 2005; Zhou et al., 2001). The PTPζ signaling pathway has been examined, and several characterizations have been postulated (Garwood et al., 2001; Margolis and Margolis, 1993; Sugahara et al., 2003; Tanaka et al., 2003). Pleiotrophin and midkine are growth factors that can bind PTPζ on cell surfaces through CS chains. Receptor dimerization and subsequent phosphatase inactivity could manifest, altering G protein-coupled receptor kinase interactor 1 (GIT1) tyrosine phosphorylation levels resulting in cytoskeleton modulation. Binding by pleiotrophin and midkine can be thoroughly ablated by free CS-D and CS-E saccharides and partially inhibited via DS and C6S chains (but not through C4S) (Kawachi et al., 2001; Sugahara et al., 2003). Phosphacan is a secreted variant of PTPζ present in the ECM. Phosphacan CS chains can interact with pleiotrophin and midkine as well, and it has been proposed that this interaction results in the presentation of these two ligands to PTPζ on the cell surface (Sugahara et al., 2003).

Perhaps the most provocative evidence for the role of GalAGs in neural development is the findings that these sugars are critical in cytokinesis and morphogenesis during the early embryonic stages of the nematode, *Caenorhabditis elegans* (Hwang et al., 2003; Mizuguchi et al., 2003). Investigations of GalAG biosynthesis have led to a unique human chondroitin synthase gene family.

Although GAG chains are essential for the proper development and functioning of the central nervous system, CS chains in particular have also been implicated as a major deterrent to the regeneration of axons following traumatic injury to brain and spinal cord (Fawcett and Asher, 1999; Moon et al., 2001; Morgenstern et al., 2002; Properzi et al., 2003; Zuo et al., 1998, 2002). Such injuries result in paralysis, and the prognosis for recovery is bleak. One strategy in development for neural regeneration makes use of enzymes that prune away inhibitory CS chains present in the glial scar, allowing regrowth of axons and some functional locomotor recovery in animal models (Bradbury et al., 2002).

### E. Pathogen Receptors

Various pathogens, including viruses and bacteria, use CS and DS on cell surfaces as the point of attachment to host tissues (Menozzi et al., 2002; Sugahara et al., 2003; Trowbridge and Gallo, 2002). The role of glycoprotein C for the binding of herpes simplex virus type 1 to cell surface CS has been established (Mardberg et al., 2002). By interfering with glycoprotein C-GAG interaction, a CS chain with the sequence GlcAβ1–3GalNAc4S6S can inhibit herpes simplex virus’ infectivity (Nyberg

et al., 2004; Sugahara et al., 2003). Undersulfated C4S dodecasaccharides (minimum length) are required for the adhesion of malaria-infected erythrocytes to placenta (Achur et al., 2003; Gamain et al., 2002; Valiyaveettil et al., 2004); 6-O-sulfation inhibits this process (Chai et al., 2002). The causative agent of Lyme disease, *Borrelia burgdorferi*, has strain-specific interactions with GAG chains, as some strains bind both HS and DS, and some recognize only DS (Parveen et al., 2003). *Streptococcus pyogenes* expresses a variety of surface adhesins including M protein, an important virulence factor that binds heparin, HS, and DS (Frick et al., 2003).

# V. The Biosynthesis of GalAGs

GalAGs play such a central role in biology that it is worthwhile to consider just how the structural diversity that governs their function actually comes about. The chemical complexity that allows these biopolymers to control so many essential life functions is the result of a system of intricate molecular machines each of which puts in place a particular structural element of the polymer chain. Unlike DNA or proteins, the biosynthesis of polysaccharides does not proceed through a template-based mechanism.

## A. Overview

The extensive variation in GalAG composition based on core protein or tissue localization is so pronounced that one must closely examine GalAG production processes in order to further develop a context for their bioregulatory roles. It has become clear that cells apply exquisite control over GalAG composition and sequence. This supervision is governed by tissue-specific expression of only certain isoforms of GalAG biosynthetic enzymes (Table III). Since the polymer modification reactions colocalize to a specific area within the Golgi apparatus, it has been postulated that these enzymes form a larger supramolecular complex that coordinates polymer modification (Sasisekharan and Venkataraman, 2000). Such a situation may provide for enzyme “crosstalk” to supplement further control over the GalAG’s structural milieu.

Figures 3 and 4 summarize the biosynthetic steps in the formation of CS and DS. Following synthesis of the core protein, xylosylation of specific serine residues sets in motion GAG formation (Esko, 1999). Addition of two galactose residues and a GlcA residue completes the linker tetrasaccharide common to both HSGAGs and GalAGs. Subsequent addition of GalNAc to the linker commits the chain to GalAG lineage. Then, the alternate addition of GlcA and GalNAc residues results in chain elongation. There is also variable modification of the chain through epimerization and sulfation reactions. Following synthesis of the GalAG chain within the PG context,

FIGURE 3 GalAG biosynthesis: precursor configuration and linkage region synthesis. (A) The formation of the sugars necessary for the biosynthesis of CS and DS. Glucose is the main source of all GalAG precursors. Galactose, derived predominantly from lactose, can be processed to UDP-Gal, UDP-GlcA, and UDP-Xyl. (B) The synthesis of the linkage region. GalAG chains are linked to specific serine residues in core proteins by the same tetrasaccharide sequence as HSGAGs (GlcA-Gal-Gal-Xyl). The first step that commits the nascent chain to GalAG formation rather than HSGAG formation is catalyzed by GalNAc transferase I. The pertinent chemistry outlined in each step in the GalAG biosynthesis pathway is highlighted in red. The nomenclature for the monosaccharides is as follows: glucose (blue circles), galactose (yellow circles), xylose (orange stars), glucuronic acid (diamond in blue), N-acetyl-D-galactosamine (yellow square), core protein with linkage serine (green), and iduronic acid (diamond in brown). Enzymes are indicated in purple.

The pertinent chemistry of each step in the GalAG biosynthesis pathway is indicated in red. The nomenclature is as described in Fig. 3.

the PG is transported, using specific recognition, sorting, and delivery mechanisms, from the Golgi apparatus to the ECM, the cell surface, or intracellular organelles (Prydz and Dalen, 2000).

B. Core Protein Synthesis and Precursor Formation

It is unclear how a protein is committed to a particular PG lineage. No single consensus sequence has been determined for chain initiation, although generally a substituted serine and glycine pair (following several acidic amino acids) is required. Biosynthesis of the core protein is initiated with translation in the cytosol. Translocation of the nascent polypeptide into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum through the translocon follows via a signal sequence-mediated process. Then, N-linked oligosaccharides are added to asparagine residues from dolichol phosphate intermediates. Prior to exit from the endoplasmic reticulum, the core protein undergoes chaperone-mediated folding and the formation of disulfide bonds (Silbert and Sugumaran, 2002).

Cells active in GAG synthesis contain all of the necessary enzymes for precursor formation (Fig. 3A). This is critical as sugar nucleotides do not normally enter cells (Silbert and Sugumaran, 2002). Glucose is the chief source of sugar nucleotides for GalAG biosynthesis. To a lesser extent, galactose (from lactose or other sources) and glucosamine are also capable of contributing to precursor formation. ATP sulfurylase and APS kinase catalyze the formation of 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate (PAPS), important for backbone sulfation (Lyle et al., 1994). After cytosol-based activation of the sugars and sulfation, an antiport mechanism transports the nucleotides and PAPS into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum or Golgi apparatus (Abeijon et al., 1997).

C. The Linker Tetrasaccharide

Both GalAG and heparin/heparan chains are linked to core protein serine residues by the same tetrasaccharide sequence: GlcA-Gal-Gal-Xyl (Fig. 3B) (Silbert and Sugumaran, 2002; Sugahara and Kitagawa, 2002). Many of the enzymes that catalyze the addition of the linkage sugars in GalAG biosynthesis are the same for heparin/HS formation, including Xyl transferase and Gal transferase I (Esko and Zhang, 1996; Getting et al., 2000; Prydz and Dalen, 2000; Silbert and Sugumaran, 2002; Sugahara and Kitagawa, 2002). Xylosylation is initiated in the endoplasmic reticulum and continues in the early Golgi apparatus (Kearns et al., 1993; Vertel et al., 1993). The interaction of the Xyl transferase first with the core protein and subsequently with Gal transferase I likely serves a docking purpose, delivering the xylosylated core protein to the Gal I transferase in the early Golgi apparatus (Ju et al., 2002; Okajima et al., 1999; Silbert and Sugumaran, 2002; Uyama et al., 2003). Gal transferase II mediates the transfer of another galactose residue (Bai et al., 2001; Kolbinger et al., 1998). The addition of GlcA to Gal in the linkage region proceeds in the medial/trans Golgi, distal to the position of Gal addition (Kitagawa et al., 1998;

Wei *et al.*, 1999). The next step in the pathway is a point of divergence, where addition of GalNAc to the linker tetrasaccharide commits to GalAG (rather than HSGAG) formation. This step is catalyzed by GalNAc transferase I (Kitagawa *et al.*, 2001; Uyama *et al.*, 2003). A cloned and expressed enzyme, human chondroitin N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase, was shown to both add the initial GalNAc residue and synthesize the polymer chain. This suggests that there may exist several GalNAc I transferases, each differing in their polymerization capacity (Silbert and Sugumaran, 2002; Uyama *et al.*, 2003).

### D. Polymer Biosynthesis

The GalAG chain undergoes polymerization in the Golgi (Gotoh *et al.*, 2002; Guo *et al.*, 2001; Kitagawa *et al.*, 2001; Silbert and DeLuca, 1969; Silbert and Freilich, 1980; Yada *et al.*, 2003a,b) with the alternate transfer of GlcA and GalNAc residues from activated precursors (Fig. 4A). The GalNAc and GlcA transferases add individual sugars to the nonreducing end of the PG acceptor (Prydz and Dalen, 2000).

The addition of each unit (GlcA and GalNAc) is independent (Silbert and Reppucci, 1976). That is, the addition of the next sugar does not proceed until the concentration of the chain with the first sugar in place is substantial. This suggests that the chemical machinery facilitating GlcA and GalNAc addition occurs on discrete proteins or at least through separate sets of catalytic machinery at distinct sites on the same protein. Several human and bacterial chondroitin synthases (DeAngelis and Padgett-McCue, 2000; Kitagawa *et al.*, 2001; Ninomiya *et al.*, 2002) have been identified that have both GlcA and GalNAc transferase activities (the ability to influence linkage region chemistry varies).

### E. Chemical Modification

The linkage region of the GalAG chain can itself be chemically modified. The C-2 of xylose can be phosphorylated in a variety of PGs (Oegema *et al.*, 1984; Sugahara *et al.*, 1992a,b,c). Often, xylose is phosphorylated subsequent to the addition of the two Gal linker residues and dephosphorylated on addition of the linker GlcA (Moses *et al.*, 1997, 1999). Linkage region sulfation occurs in GalAGs but not in HSGAGs. CS and DS can be 4-O-sulfated at the second linker Gal and 4-O-sulfated or 6-O-sulfated in the first GalNAc distal to the linkage region (Sugahara *et al.*, 1988, 1991). Epimerization of the final moiety of the linker tetrasaccharide also occurs.

Studies with GAG-degrading enzymes (Ernst *et al.*, 1995; Saito *et al.*, 1968) have revealed that GalAG sulfation patterns are highly heterogeneous *in vivo* (Kusche-Gullberg and Kjellen, 2003). CS polymers can comprise
only GalNAc4S; only GalNAc6S; both GalNAc4S and GalNAc6S in the same chain; GalNAc4S,6S; 2- or 3-sulfated GlcA; or unsulfated GalNAc. DS most commonly contains GalNAc4S, 2-sulfated IdoA, unsulfated GalNAc, and unsulfated IdoA. GalNAc6S also has been reported (Evers et al., 2001; Hiraoka et al., 2000; Kang et al., 2002). GalAG 6-O-sulfation occurs in the medial/trans Golgi apparatus, and 4-O-sulfation takes place later in the trans Golgi (Silbert and Sugumaran, 2002). Polymer sulfation seems to occur as the chain grows (Sugumaran and Silbert, 1990) and not after chain termination. A number of chondroitin 6-O-sulfotransferases have been characterized (Table III) (Fukuta et al., 1998; Kitagawa et al., 2000; Uchimura et al., 2002). These generally catalyze the sulfation of KS Gal residues and chondroitin GalNAc (Fukuta et al., 1995; Habuchi et al., 1993, 2000; Sugumaran et al., 1995). Another 6-O-sulfotransferase, purified from squid cartilage and related to the human B-cell recombination activating gene-associated gene, transfers sulfate to the nonreducing terminal GalNAc4S residue of CS (Ohtake et al., 2001). An additional 6-O-sulfotransferase (Nadanaka et al., 1999) acts only on GalNAc residues adjacent to dermatan IdoA. Sulfation at the 4-O-position of GalNAc proceeds via specific 4-O-sulfotransferases that modify either chondroitin (Yamauchi et al., 2000) or dermatan (Evers et al., 2001), exclusively. Sulfation at the 2-O-position, prevalent in DS but relatively rare in CS, is mediated by a 2-O-sulfotransferase (Kobayashi et al., 1999) that sulfates IdoA adjacent to GalNAc4S. Although 3-O-sulfated GlcA chondroitin has been observed from nonmammalian sources (Kitagawa et al., 1997), no 3-O-sulfotransferase has been characterized to date.

Chemical modification at C5 of the uronic acid moiety of a GalAG disaccharide offers two possible epimerization states, resulting in CS (GlcA) or DS (IdoA). This process of transforming GlcA to IdoA likely takes place in the early Golgi apparatus, during or shortly after chondroitin formation and concomitant with sulfation at the 4-O-position (Silbert and Sugumaran, 2002). The C5-epimerase responsible has not been cloned.

## F. Chain Termination

CS chains terminate in unsulfated GlcA or GalNAc with any of the usual sulfation states (Silbert, 1978). Although the addition of GlcA to terminal GalNAc6S is facile, the further addition of GlcA is blocked with GalNAc4S at the nonreducing end (Silbert and Freilich, 1980). Further, GalNAc addition is inhibited with a GalNAc4S residue preterminal to GlcA at the nonreducing end (Cogburn and Silbert, 1986; Silbert and Sugumaran, 2002). A process has been postulated whereby action with a 6-O-sulfotransferase specific for terminal GalNAc4S and desulfation at the 4-O-position results in terminal GalNAc6S (Nakanishi et al., 1981; Otsu et al., 1984), allowing further chain elongation.
VI. The Catabolism of GalAGs

Just as polysaccharides are synthesized by intricate biological and chemical processes, they must also be degraded as a part of the normal turnover of biomolecules. The cellular degradation of polysaccharides represents a cluster of critical biological pathways, essential for the continued proper functioning of the organism as a whole.

### A. Cellular Degradation of GalAGs

GalAG polymers are degraded in lysosomes to liberated monosaccharide moieties, many of which are shuffled back into biosynthetic pathways. Aberrant degradation of GalAG polymers results in one of a group of lysosomal storage diseases. These genetic disorders are rare, yet their study has led to the elucidation of catabolic pathways for complex polysaccharides.

GalAG degradation *in vivo* is a highly ordered process dependent upon the action of specific hydrolases. These hydrolases are substrate specific according to: (1) sugar stereoconfiguration, (2) glycosidic linkage, (3) substitution pattern of backbone hydroxyl groups, (4) pH of the subcellular compartment, and (5) the sugar residues adjacent to the site of cleavage.

The first class of glycoprotein hydrolases is the exoglycosidases (Table IV), which catalyze the release of specific monosaccharides that terminate the nonreducing end of the oligosaccharide chain. Because they generally recognize only one nonreducing end monosaccharide, they are

often broadly specific, barely receptive to other sugar moieties in the chain. The endoglycosidases hydrolyze specific sugar sequences within the biopolymer (Jourdan, 1996). One should note that there are no highly conserved glycosidase domains. Oligosaccharide chains are therefore partially cleaved by enzymes at a few specific internal sites, generating fragments on the order of 10 kDa. This endoglycosidase action results in multiple terminal residues, which can be catalytically released through the action of various sulfatases (Table IV) and exoglycosidases, obviating the time-consuming and tedious scenario of exoglycosidase-only digestion. Since exoglycosidases do not degrade substituted sugars, such chemical groups must first be removed.

## B. Pathological Catabolism

The loss of GAG-catabolizing lysosomal enzymes leads to the accumulation of undegraded oligosaccharide in cells and tissue, and the subsequent secretion of this material. Most diseases of GAG catabolic pathways share a variety of common symptoms (Table V). Specific diagnosis usually requires an experienced and expert clinician to pinpoint specific symptomatic features of the given disorder. Defects in glycan degradation generally manifest with a range of severities. The mucopolysaccharidoses are lysosomal disorders that share many clinical features. These involve multisystem involvement, organomegaly, dysostosis multiplex, and abnormal facies. Respiration, vision, and cardiovascular function may be impaired. Joint mobility and skeletal abnormalities are common (Neufeld and Muenzer, 2001). Onset in youth is usually the most severe; onset during adulthood is often more mild (Freeze, 1999; Jourdan, 1996; Michalski, 1996).

## C. Catabolism of DS and CS

Figure 5 summarizes the important events in the cellular degradation of GalAG polymers. Following hyaluronidase-mediated slicing of an oligosaccharide chain, DS is degraded initially with iduronate-2-sulfatase (EC 3.1.6.13), a hydrolase of lysosomal origin (Bielicki et al., 1993; Wilson et al., 1993). The 24 kb gene for iduronate-2-sulfatase has been localized to Xq27/28. The protein is synthesized as two precursor forms of 76 and 90 kDa. Subsequent modification of N-linked sugar residues follows. Posttranslational processing to incorporate phosphorylated mannose-6-phosphate allows targeting of the protein to the lysosome. In humans, an inherited deficiency of this enzyme results in a congenital storage disorder known as mucopolysaccharidosis type II (Hunter syndrome). Afflicted individuals accumulate undegraded DS (and HS) in the lysosome. Accumulation of these GAG chains leads to a spectrum of clinical phenotypes, including progressive neurological dysfunction and mental retardation. Preliminary

FIGURE 5 Cellular degradation of galactosaminoglycans. The degradation *in vivo* of GalAG polymers proceeds sequentially via the action of a combination of endoglycosidases, sulfatases, and exoglycosidases. Degradation is initiated by the endolytic cleavage of the long oligosaccharide chain into smaller fragments. Then, removal of sulfatases and exoglycosidase action mediates further degradation. The pertinent target for degradation at each step is indicated in red. The nomenclature is as described in Fig. 3.

sulfatase cleavage occurs. β-N-acetylhexosaminidase A is one of the very few exoglycosidases that can cleave sulfated amino sugars at low pH (Keyhani and Roseman, 1996; Litjens et al., 1996; Pennybacker et al., 1996).

Absence of GalNAc-4-sulfatase affects DS catabolism and manifests in mucopolysaccharidosis type VI (Maroteaux-Lamy syndrome). Clinically, growth retardation starts at the age of two or three, with coarsening of facial features, corneal clouding, joint stiffness, and abnormalities in the

hands and spine. Tay-Sachs disease is a disorder in glycolipid degradation resulting from deficiency in $\beta$-N-acetylhexosaminidase A. In its most severe form, neurodegeneration leads to death within 4 years. At its mildest, there is a somewhat slower onset of neurological symptoms. $\beta$-N-acetylhexosaminidase A and B deficiencies lead to Sandhoff disease with excreted glucosaminyl oligosaccharides. Clinical symptoms of Sandhoff disease closely resemble Tay-Sachs disease.

$\beta$-Glucuronidase cleaves the $\beta$-GlcA residue ([Oshima *et al.*, 1987](https://doi.org/10.1016/0022-2836(87)90545-6); [Shipley *et al.*, 1993](https://doi.org/10.1016/0022-2836(93)90342-8)). This process is continuously cycled until the oligosaccharides are reduced to free monosaccharide derivatives and sulfate ions. Deficiency in $\beta$-glucuronidase activity results in mucopolysaccharidosis type VII, affecting the catabolism of DS, HS, and CS. Clinical features of this syndrome vary from patient to patient, but all patients have growth retardation with resultant short stature, some bone abnormalities, and mental retardation. Osteoarthritis is also prevalent. Survival into adulthood is common with milder forms of the pathology.

Hyaluronidase sets the stage for CS degradation at the cellular level. Lysosomal CS catabolism proceeds in analogous fashion to DS, with GalNAc-4-sulfatase and GalNAc-6-sulfatase ([Masuno *et al.*, 1993](https://doi.org/10.1016/0022-2836(93)90342-8); [Morris *et al.*, 1994](https://doi.org/10.1016/0022-2836(93)90342-8); [Sukegawa *et al.*, 2000](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0022-2836(00)90342-8)) leading the way for $\beta$-N-acetylhexosaminidase A or B and $\beta$-glucuronidase.

No mammalian endoglycosidases specific for GalAGs have been reported, although a variety of bacterial chondroitinases has been isolated and characterized. Hyaluronidase deficiency (MPS Type IX) has been reported in only one case in which it clinically manifested in periarticular soft tissue masses, episodic painful swelling, and short stature ([Natowicz *et al.*, 1996](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0022-2836(93)90342-8)).

## VII. The Enzymatic Degradation of GalAGs

### A. Mechanisms of GAG Depolymerization

We have seen that *in vivo*, GAGs are degraded by a variety of enzymes of predominantly lysosomal origin—the hydrolases and various exoglycosidases. Another class of GAG-degrading enzymes includes the bacterial lyases (Table VI). These come in three categories, classified according to substrate: hyaluronidases, heparinases, and chondroitinases. Many lyases have been purified and employed in a variety of analytical and industrial applications. The following describes the depolymerizing action of lyases that act on GalAGs, the chondroitinases, and the hyaluronidases.

There are two chemical mechanisms whereby GAGs undergo cleavage. With eliminative cleavage, the proton off of C5 of the uronic acid moiety is first abstracted. This results in an unsaturated bond between C4 and C5 of

the uronic acid. Protonation of the anomic oxygen completes the reaction with the breaking of the glycosidic bond. At its simplest, it can be visualized as a proton acceptance and donation mechanism (Jedrzejas, 2000). Hydrolytic cleavage proceeds slightly differently, first with proton donation to the glycosidic bond. This breaks away the glycosidic oxygen, creating an O5 oxonium ion. Water addition neutralizes the oxonium ion and saturates all carbons (Linhardt et al., 1986). One should note that although lyases can only cleave linkages on the nonreducing side of uronic acid, the hydrolases have no such limitation and can cleave either bond.

## B. GalAG Lyase-Mediated Degradation of GAGs

Chondroitinases (Table VI) are produced in soil and intestinal bacteria. Polysaccharides trafficked to the intestinal lumen with epithelial cells provide these bacteria with their nutrient source. Chondroitin lyases have been isolated and characterized from a variety genera, most notably Pedobacter (Fethiere et al., 1999; Huang et al., 1999; Michelacci et al., 1987; Pojasek et al., 2001, 2002; Yamagata et al., 1968) and Proteus (Hamai et al., 1997; Huang et al., 2003; Michel et al., 2004; Ryan et al., 1994; Sato et al., 1994; Yamagata et al., 1968). Chondroitinases have also been isolated from Arthrobacter (Lunin et al., 2004), Aeromonas (Kitamikado and Lee,

1975), Bacillus (Ernst *et al.*, 1995), and Bacteroides (Guthrie *et al.*, 1985; Hwa and Salyers, 1992a,b; Linn *et al.*, 1983).

### C. Chondroitinases from *Pedobacter heparinus*

Chondroitinase ABC from *P. heparinus* is a broad substrate specificity lyase that acts on a variety of GAGs, including C4S, C6S, DS, chondroitin, chondroitin D and E. The enzyme is unable to catalyze the depolymerization of hyaluronate, heparin and HS, or KS. It has a molecular weight in excess of 70 kDa and an optimal activity temperature of $30^\circ$C. The enzyme is fully active against DS, which is unusual for cABC lyases generally. Other cABC lyases have DS activities under 40% of their C4S activity (Ernst *et al.*, 1995). Chondroitinase ABC causes the weight average molecular weight of a GalAG substrate to decrease slowly. The enzyme acts exclusively on the reducing end of the oligosaccharide chain, suggesting a wholly exolytic activity (Michelacci *et al.*, 1987). The enzyme does not seem amenable to modeling by Michaelis-Menten kinetics, and thus some other mechanism may be in force. The reaction is inhibited by its product (UA-GalNAc4S), by excess substrate (Michelacci *et al.*, 1987), $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, $\mathrm{PO}_{4}^{3-}$, $\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}$, and $\mathrm{Mn}^{2+}$.

Chondroitinase AC (EC 4.2.2.5) from *P. heparinus* is a 75-kDa enzyme that acts on C4S, C6S, chondroitin, and hyaluronate (Fig. 6) (Huang *et al.*, 2001). It is completely incapable of DS cleavage. At the onset of reaction, the substrate's molecular weight drops dramatically, producing intermediate hexasaccharide and tetrasaccharide, with further degradation over time (Rye and Withers, 2002b). This suggests a predominantly endolytic mode of action. Heparin and DS are notable inhibitors of enzyme activity (Pojasek *et al.*, 2001; Rye and Withers, 2002a,b,c).

Chondroitinase B from *P. heparinus* has been characterized extensively (Fig. 7) (Huang *et al.*, 1999; Michel *et al.*, 2004; Pojasek *et al.*, 2001, 2002). It is the only known lyase that cleaves DS as its sole substrate. Chondroitinase B can cleave DS $\beta(1,4)$ bonds that contain the commonly occurring 4-O-sulfate but also linkages with sulfation at the 2-O-position, 6-O-position, or both. X-ray crystallography (Huang *et al.*, 1999), site-directed mutagenesis (Michel *et al.*, 2004; Pojasek *et al.*, 2002), and modeling studies (Pojasek *et al.*, 2002) have identified critical amino acids involved in substrate binding and catalytic activity. Chondroitinase B’s activity is nonrandom, nonprocessive, and endolytic, preferring longer substrate to shorter ones. It works primarily by cutting internal bonds proximal to the reducing end, although other cleavage sites are also susceptible. An Arg364Ala mutant has been shown to have an altered mode of action yielding an altered product profile. This phenomenon is most likely explained through the differentiated binding between this mutant and DS. Additionally, a complex between $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, chondroitinase B, and DS is required for substrate cleavage. It has been proposed that the $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ ion neutralizes the IdoA carboxylate in

(B) Structure of chondroitinase ABC I from *Proteus vulgaris* based on the crystal structure by Huang *et al.* (2003). The similarities in the domains of both enzymes are evident. On a closer inspection, the middle domain of cABC I has very little sequence identity with the catalytic domain of cAC (and bacterial hyaluronidases). However, the residues that are implicated to play important roles in catalysis are conserved in both enzymes (Prabhakar *et al.*, 2005). These catalytic residues are shown in full (purple). The more open cleft of cABC I is possibly suggestive of this enzyme's ability to accommodate a variety of oligosaccharide geometries and thus its wider substrate specificity.

the result of the general heterogeneity of GAG polymers in which oligosaccharides that may contain predominantly C6S actually exist as copolymers with C4S.

## D. Chondroitinases from *Proteus vulgaris*

The conventional broad substrate specificity enzyme from *P. vulgaris* (Ernst *et al.*, 1995; Sato *et al.*, 1994; Yamagata *et al.*, 1968) has actually been found to comprise two distinct lyases, chondroitinases ABC I and II. Both enzymes cleave a wide variety of GalAGs and hyaluronan. Chondroitinase ABC I has been recombinantly expressed and characterized (Hamai *et al.*, 1997; Michel *et al.*, 2004), and its structure has been elucidated (Fig. 7) (Huang *et al.*, 2003). It has a molecular weight of 105 kDa and optimally processes CS and DS substrates at 37°C. CS substrates are processed at greater rates than DS: 40% greater activity with C6S and more than a twofold increase with C4S. Activity is maximal for CS substrates at a pH of 7.9; for hyaluronan, the optimal pH is 6.1. Chondroitinase ABC I activity is inhibited by Zn²⁺ and heparin. The products of an exhaustive digestion
of CS or DS comprise a mixture of unsaturated tetrasaccharides and disaccharides (Prabhakar *et al.*, 2005). Putative catalytic residues of cABC I include His501, Tyr508, Arg560, and Glu653 (Prabhakar *et al.*, 2005). Arginine-500 may also be involved in substrate catalysis (Huang *et al.*, 2003). The lyase acts using the proton acceptance and donation mechanism described earlier. Chondroitinase ABC I is commercially available.

The cABC II lyase from *P. vulgaris* has been scrutinized far less thoroughly (Hamai *et al.*, 1997; Ryan *et al.*, 1994). Chondroitinase ABC II is 100 kDa in size and optimally processes GalAG substrates at pH 7.9 at $40^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. Although cABC II is just as broad as cABC I in terms of substrate profile, it is a far less efficient enzyme regarding catalytic activity. In fact, cABC II processes C4S 16-fold less effectively than cABC I and DS 8-fold less (Hamai *et al.*, 1997; Ryan *et al.*, 1994). The product profile for cABC II is similar to that of cABC I.

### E. Chondroitinase AC from Arthrobacter aurescens

Chondroitinase AC from *A. aurescens* (Hiyama and Okada, 1976, 1977) is a 76-kDa enzyme that processes C4S, C6S, chondroitin, and hyaluronan. It is inhibited by DS. The enzyme processes these substrates exolytically, producing almost exclusively disaccharide products (Jandik *et al.*, 1994). Chondroitinase AC will cleave CS/DS copolymers but only at linkages containing glucuronic acid (Gu *et al.*, 1993; Linhardt *et al.*, 1991).

### F. Bacterial Hyaluronidases

Hyaluronidases have been purified from the bacterial genera *Propionibacterium*, *Peptostreptococcus*, *Staphylococcus*, *Streptococcus*, and *Streptomyces* (Linhardt *et al.*, 1986). Specific activities of hyaluronidases vary widely. The lyase from *Peptostreptococcus* has a remarkably high turnover number, with an activity of 600,000 IU/mg (Tam and Chan, 1985). Hyaluronidase from *Staphylococcus* has a specific activity of 15 IU/mg (Rautela and Abramson, 1973; Vesterberg, 1968). Though hyaluronate is the major substrate, C4S and C6S can also be cleaved by many hyaluronidases, albeit at lower rates. Because of the great variation in catalytic rates among hyaluronidases and the relative inconsequentiality of pH for activity, it has been suggested that these enzymes may employ a mechanism fundamentally distinct from other GAG lyases.

### VIII. Perspectives

The limited availability and vast heterogeneity of tissue-derived GalAGs (and other GAGs) has hampered efforts to characterize their sequence-specific influences on proteins and other signaling molecules. Their complex
nontemplate-driven biosynthesis precludes the possibility of amplification, unlike DNA and proteins, further complicating glycobiological study. Novel synthetic strategies for the fabrication of complex polysaccharides are still in their infancy. These limitations have forced investigators to cultivate sensitive analytical systems to examine GAG properties.

FIGURE 8 Techniques for GalAG sequencing analysis. Three major developments have propelled techniques to characterize the fine structural elements of complex polysaccharides: (1) the development of enzymatic tools to specifically degrade functional groups on an oligosaccharide chain, (2) analytical chemical approaches, including mass spectrometry, capillary electrophoresis, and nuclear magnetic resonance to establish complementary, orthogonal sets of structural data, and (3) a bioinformatics platform to integrate disparate data elements into a numerical strategy for sequencing. These techniques allow for the rapid and bias-free sequencing of complex polysaccharides by considering all possible compositions and converging at a single solution.

The cloning and characterization of heparinase I allowed the first determination of a heparin-binding site (*Sasisekharan et al.*, 1993). Since then, there has been a surge of activity regarding the development of biopolymer-degrading enzymes, including various chondroitinases and exoenzymes. Structural investigations of these enzymes, including crystallographic, spatial modeling, and nuclear magnetic resonance studies, have shed considerable light on enzyme interaction with substrate. Further, the study of GAG biosynthetic and catabolic enzymes *in vivo* has revealed a wealth of insight regarding structural and chemical properties of GAG populations. GAG detection on a variety of platforms has been sensitized by introducing UV chromophores and covalent derivitization with fluorescence or radioactive tags. Mass spectrometric methods have enabled detection of pico- to femtogram quantities of material. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization MS of sulfated oligosaccharides is now accurate to within 1 Da. Capillary electrophoresis and liquid chromatography are now being used in tandem with MS to directly identify disaccharides based on mass. These approaches have been coupled with bioinformatics methodologies, including property-encoded nomenclature, to form

sequencing strategies (Fig. 8) to elucidate the fine structural elements of complex polysaccharides (Sasisekharan and Venkataraman, 2000; Turnbull et al., 1999; Venkataraman et al., 1999). These tactics rely on the integration of disparate experimentally derived data sets, each of which reinforce each other to provide a solution set of possible polysaccharide sequences. Numerical constraints, including established rules for linkage susceptibility to cleavage, further allow convergence to a single sequence. These attempts at sequence elucidation will be crucial in extending our understanding of the emerging paradigm of sequence-specific binding and modulation of proteins by polysaccharides.

The sweeping involvement of complex polysaccharides like GalAGs within critical biochemical pathways and disease processes heralds a coming age in which glycan biotechnologies will be central elements in diagnostic strategies and therapeutic interventions (Table VII). Such biomedical technologies will include glycan-based approaches for multicellular diseases (Shriver et al., 2004), glycan-based drug improvement strategies, enzyme replacement therapies, and glycome profiling both to screen disease severity in patients and to develop novel medical interventions.
