Aldosterone biosynthesis in the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal cortex is regulated by transcription of CYP11B2 (encoding aldosterone synthase). The effects of nerve growth factor-induced clone B (NGFIB) (NR4A1), Nur-related factor 1 (NURR1) (NR4A2), and steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1) (NR5A1) on transcription of human CYP11B2 (hCYP11B2) and hCYP11B1 (11β-hydroxylase) were compared in human H295R adrenocortical cells. hCYP11B2 expression was increased by NGFIB and NURR1. Although hCYP11B1 was activated by SF-1, cotransfection with SF-1 inhibited activation of hCYP11B2 by NGFIB and NURR1. NGFIB and NURR1 transcript and protein levels were strongly induced by angiotensin (Ang) II, the major regulator of hCYP11B2 expression in vivo. Sequential deletion and mutagenesis of the hCYP11B2 promoter identified two functional NGFIB response elements (NBREs), one located at –766/–759 (NBRE-1) and the previously studied Ad5 element at –129/–114. EMSAs suggested that both elements bound NGFIB and NURR1. In human adrenals, NURR1 immunoreactivity was preferentially localized in the zona glomerulosa and to a lesser degree in the zona fasciculata, whereas NGFIB was detected in both zones. The calmodulin kinase inhibitor KN93 partially blocked K⁺-stimulated transcription of NGFIB and NURR1. KN93 partially inhibited the effect of Ang II on NURR1 mRNA levels but did not modify the effect on expression of NGFIB. Mutation of the NBRE-1, Ad5, and Ad1/cAMP response element (CRE) cis-elements reduced both basal and Ang II-induced levels of hCYP11B2, demonstrating that all three elements are important for maximal transcriptional activity. Our results suggest that NGFIB and NURR1 are key regulators of hCYP11B2 expression and may partially mediate the regulation of hCYP11B2 by Ang II. (Molecular Endocrinology 18: 279–290, 2004)

THE ADRENAL CORTEX is the primary site of mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid biosynthesis. In humans, the synthesis of aldosterone, the major mineralocorticoid, relies on CYP11B2 (aldosterone synthase), a steroid-metabolizing cytochrome P450 (CYP). This enzyme converts deoxycorticosterone to aldosterone (1, 2). It is expressed only within the adrenal zona glomerulosa and is under the control of circulating levels of angiotensin (Ang) II and potassium (3–5). In contrast, CYP11B1 (11β-hydroxylase), which converts deoxycortisol to cortisol (1, 2), is regulated by ACTH and is expressed predominantly in the adrenal zona fasciculata (3, 6). Deoxycorticosterone is also synthesized in the fasciculata at levels that would lead to mineralocorticoid excess if it were converted to aldosterone. Thus, the ability of the adrenal cortex to control aldosterone production is the result of limiting the expression of human CYP11B2 (hCYP11B2) to the zona glomerulosa. The zonal distribution of hCYP11B2 is presumably due to the zone-specific expression of enhancer and/or repressor proteins that interact with specific elements in the promoter of this gene.

The trans-acting factors that regulate hCYP11B2 expression remain poorly defined. The orphan nuclear receptor, steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1), is a major regulator of other steroid hydroxylase genes including hCYP11B1 (7, 8), but it fails to stimulate and indeed represses expression of hCYP11B2 (9). Other transcription factors that are expressed in the adrenal cortex include the NGFIB family of orphan nuclear receptors (termed the NR4A subgroup for nuclear receptor subgroup 4) (10). This family includes NGFIB (nerve growth factor-induced clone B, also termed NR4A1), NURR1 (Nur-related factor 1, NR4A2), and neuron-derived orphan receptor 1 (NR4A3) (11). All three nuclear receptors are rapidly induced early response genes that enhance transcription by binding to a consensus sequence (AAAGGTCA) called a NGFIB response element (NBRE) (12, 13). Among steroidogenic genes, the human and mouse CYP21 gene promoters contain

canonical NBREs and a role for NGFIB in CYP21 transcription has been proposed (14, 15).

In the current study, we examined the role of two NGFIB family members, NGFIB and NURR1, in the regulation of hCYP11B2. Our results show that NGFIB and NURR1 activate the hCYP11B2 promoter. Both transcription factors are up-regulated by Ang II, the primary regulator of hCYP11B2 expression *in vivo*. Both are expressed in the zona glomerulosa, the site of hCYP11B2 expression. Finally, whereas NGFIB and NURR1 are potent activators of hCYP11B2 expression, they do not stimulate transcription of hCYP11B1. Thus, NGFIB and/or NURR1 may contribute to the localized expression of hCYP11B2 within the zona glomerulosa as well as agonist-regulated expression.

**RESULTS**

**NGFIB and NURR1 Activate the Transcription of hCYP11B2**

To determine whether NGFIB or NURR1 might contribute to the regulated expression of the hCYP11B2 gene, we cotransfected H295R cells with a reporter construct containing 5′-flanking DNA from hCYP11B2 and with increasing concentrations of expression vectors encoding NGFIB, NURR1, or SF-1 (Fig. 1A). The hCYP11B2 promoter was activated by NGFIB and NURR1 in a concentration-dependent manner with activity increasing to 3.2- and 3.9-fold above basal levels, respectively, when cells were cotransfected with 1 μg/ml of expression plasmid. As expected from our prior study (9), SF-1 failed to activate the hCYP11B2 promoter at any of the concentrations tested. In fact, 1 μg/ml of SF-1 reduced hCYP11B2 reporter expression to 72% of basal levels. In contrast to the results obtained with hCYP11B2, the hCYP11B1 reporter construct was not activated by NGFIB or NURR1 but was strongly stimulated by SF-1 (Fig. 1B).

**SF-1 Inhibits NGFIB- and NURR1-Stimulated Activation of hCYP11B2**

Because SF-1 is a known repressor of hCYP11B2, we next demonstrated that SF-1 inhibited NGFIB and NURR1 activation of the hCYP11B2 promoter in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2A). When cotransfected in equal amounts (1 μg/ml), SF-1 reduced the activity achieved by NGFIB or NURR1 alone to that observed with the basal hCYP11B2 reporter construct. As expected, cotransfection of H295R cells with SF-1 reduced both basal and Ang II-stimulated hCYP11B2 reporter activity (Fig. 2B).

**NGFIB and NURR1 Transcripts and Protein Are Induced by Ang II in H295R Adrenal Cells**

Ang II and potassium are the primary regulators of hCYP11B2 expression *in vivo* and in the H295R adrenal cell model (4, 5). To examine the effects of Ang II treatment on NGFIB and NURR1 expression, H295R cells were incubated in the presence or absence of Ang II (10 nM) for 6 and 24 h followed by analysis of NGFIB and NURR1 transcript levels on Northern blots (Fig. 3A). Low levels of NGFIB transcripts were present in untreated samples at 6 and 24 h, but NURR1 transcripts were not detectable in untreated samples.

**Fig. 1.** Comparison of the Effects of NGFIB, Nurr1, or SF-1 on the Transcriptional Activity of hCYP11B2 (A) or hCYP11B1 (B) Reporter Gene Activity

H295R adrenocortical cells were transfected with luciferase reporter constructs containing hCYP11B1 (pB1-1102) or hCYP11B2 (pB2-1521) reporter constructs (1 μg/ml). Cells were cotransfected with either empty pRc/RSV expression vector or the indicated amounts of NGFIB, NURR1, or SF-1 expression plasmid along with a β-galactosidase expression vector (0.05 μg/ml). After recovery for 24 h, cells were lysed and assayed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activity. Data were normalized to β-galactosidase and expressed as a percentage of the basal reporter activity of pB1-1102 or pB2-1521. The results in each panel represent the mean ± SEM of data from three independent experiments, each one done in triplicate (***, P < 0.0001; *, P = 0.0260 compared with basal level).

Fig. 2. SF-1 Blocks Ang II, NURR1, and NGFIB Stimulation of hCYP11B2 Transcription

A, Inhibition of NGFIB- and NURR1-stimulated hCYP11B2 reporter activity by SF-1. H295R adrenocortical cells were cotransfected with pB2-1521 5′-flanking DNA (1 μg/ml), NGFIB, or NURR1 (1 μg/ml) and increasing amounts of SF-1 (0.1, 0.3, 1.0 μg/ml) along with a β-galactosidase expression vector (0.05 μg/ml). After recovery for 24 h, cells were lysed and assayed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activity. B, Effect of SF-1 on Ang II-stimulated hCYP11B2 reporter gene activity. H295R cells were cotransfected with pB2-1521 and SF-1 (1 μg each/ml) along with a β-galactosidase expression vector (0.05 μg/ml). After recovery, cells were treated (+) or untreated (−) with Ang II (10 nM) for 6 h, then assayed as above. Data were normalized to β-galactosidase and expressed as a percentage of the basal reporter activity of the pB2-1521 construct. The results in both panels represent the mean ± SEM of data from three independent experiments each performed in triplicate.

Both NGFIB and NURR1 expression levels were high after 6 h of incubation with Ang II, but they returned to control levels by 24 h of treatment. Western analysis using cell lysates from similarly treated H295R cells confirmed that immunoreactive NGFIB and NURR1 proteins increased in parallel with transcript levels (Fig. 3B). These data demonstrate that NGFIB and NURR1 are Ang II target genes.

### Identification of NBREs by Deletion and Mutation Analyses

To identify potential NBREs within the hCYP11B2 gene promoter, a series of deletion constructs were used containing progressively shorter fragments of hCYP11B2 5′-flanking DNA (pB2-1521, pB2-864, pB2-747, pB2-135 pB2-106, and pB2-65). Deoxyribonuclease I footprint analysis of the bovine CYP11B promoter had previously identified six cis-elements, termed Ad1 through Ad6 (Adrenal 1–6), which bound nuclear proteins (16–18); similar sequences have been identified in the hCYP11B2 gene (19). These deletion constructs were transiently transfected into H295R cells along with empty pRc/RSV expression plasmid (basal) or pRc/RSV expression plasmid containing the coding sequence of NGFIB or NURR1 (Fig. 4). Both NGFIB and NURR1 stimulated the reporter activity of pB2-1521 and pB2-864 approximately 4-fold over basal levels. Further deletion to −747 bp decreased

NGFIB and NURR1 stimulation to twice basal levels suggesting that DNA between −864 and −747 contained an NBRE. Further deletion to −135 bp, which eliminated an SF-1 binding site (Ad4), did not significantly affect NGFIB or NURR1 stimulation of hCYP11B2 promoter activity. However, deletion to −106 bp abolished NGFIB and NURR1 stimulation of hCYP11B2 reporter activity indicating that nucleotides between −135 and −106 contained an additional NBRE.

Examination of the sequence of the hCYP11B2 5′ flanking region indeed revealed two potential NBREs, one at −766/−759 (NBRE-1) and the other, the previously identified Ad5 site (19), at −129/−114 on the noncoding strand (Fig. 5A). To determine the relative importance of the NBRE-1 (−766/−759) and Ad5 (−129/−114) cis-elements, both were mutated in the context of the full-length (pB2-1521) hCYP11B2 gene promoter. As shown in Fig. 5B, mutation of the NBRE-1 cis-element reduced both NGFIB- and NURR1-stimulated hCYP11B2 activity by 52% and 55%, respectively, compared with basal level. Mutation of the Ad5 site further reduced both NGFIB- and NURR1-stimulated hCYP11B2 reporter activities. Simultaneous mutations of both cis-elements reduced NGFIB- and NURR1-stimulated reporter activity to that observed with the pGL3Basic empty vector.

Ad5 probe, (panel 2), complex C3 did not comigrate with any of the *in vitro*-translated proteins whereas C4 migrated with the complex formed by SF-1. No binding of the Ad5 probe to proteins in the H295R nuclear extract corresponding to NGFIB or NURR1 was observed. Formation of C1–C4 was specifically inhibited by a 100-fold excess of unlabeled homologous oligonucleotide, indicating that all four complexes represented specific binding.

EMSA was also performed with mutated NBRE-1 and Ad5 oligonucleotides. The NBRE-1 and Ad5 mutant probes did not bind *in vitro*-prepared SF-1, NGFIB, or NURR1 (data not shown). Additionally, at least 10-fold more mutant NBRE-1 and Ad5 oligonucleotides were needed to displace H295R nuclear extract binding to their respective wild-type sequences.

### Localization of NGFIB and NURR1 in Human Adrenal Gland

A previous study localized NURR1 to the mouse zona glomerulosa (20). To determine whether NGFIB or NURR1 might contribute to the zone-specific expression of hCYP11B2, we examined the expression of these transcription factors in human adrenal sections using immunohistochemistry (Fig. 7). NGFIB immunoreactivity was detected in nuclei of both glomerulosa and fasciculata cells. NURR1 immunoreactivity was highest in nuclei of glomerulosa cells with modest expression observed in the fasciculata. Neither NGFIB nor NURR1 immunoreactivity was detected in cells of the adrenal capsule or in inner medullary cells. No staining was observed in the absence of NGFIB or NURR1 antibody. These data support a potential role for NURR1 and/or NGFIB in glomerulosa-specific expression of hCYP11B2.

### Effects of the Calmodulin (CaM) Kinase Inhibitor KN93 on Agonist-Stimulated Transcription of hCYP11B2, NGFIB, or NURR1

Ang II and K⁺ use intracellular calcium signaling which often occurs through the action of the calcium binding protein, CaM. Of the various CaM-regulated kinases described to date, it is likely that CaM kinase I and/or IV are involved in Ang II and K⁺ induction of aldosterone production (21). To determine whether calcium signaling plays a role in the transcriptional activation of NGFIB and/or NURR1, we examined the effects of the CaM kinase inhibitor, KN93, on agonist-stimulated transcription of hCYP11B2, NGFIB, and NURR1. KN93 completely blocked K⁺ induction of hCYP11B2 (Fig. 8A) and partially inhibited NGFIB and NURR1 expression (Fig. 8, B and C). KN93 also partially inhibited the effect of Ang II on hCYP11B2 and NURR1 mRNA levels but had no effect on transcription of NGFIB. These data support the hypothesis that NURR1 may play a more important role than NGFIB in Ang II-regulated hCYP11B2 expression.

### Specific Binding of NGFIB and NURR1 to the NBRE-1 (−766/−759) and Ad5 (−129/−114) cis-Elements

To determine whether NGFIB and/or NURR1 interact directly with the NBRE-1 (−766/−759) and/or Ad5 (−129/−114) cis-elements, ³²P-labeled oligonucleotides containing these elements were prepared and used in EMSAs. Both elements bound *in vitro* synthesized NGFIB, NURR1, and SF-1 protein (Fig. 6). When H295R nuclear extract was incubated with the NBRE-1 probe (panel 1), protein/DNA complex C1 comigrated with the complex formed by *in vitro*-translated NGFIB or NURR1, whereas C2 migrated with the complex formed by SF-1.

H295R cells were transiently transfected with luciferase reporter constructs containing serial deletions of hCYP11B2 5′-flanking DNA. Transfection of reporter constructs was done with empty pRc/RSV expression vector (1 μg/ml) or expression vector containing the coding sequence for NGFIB or NURR1 (1 μg/ml) along with a β-galactosidase expression vector (0.05 μg/ml). After recovery for 24 h, cells were lysed and assayed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activity. Data were normalized to β-galactosidase and expressed as a percentage of the basal reporter activity of each hCYP11B2 reporter construct. Results represent the mean ± SEM of data from a minimum of three independent experiments each performed in triplicate (***, P < 0.0001; **, P = 0.0372; *, P = 0.0390 compared with basal level).

EMSA was performed using $^{32}$P-labeled oligonucleotide probes containing either the NBRE-1 or Ad5 NBRE consensus sequence of hCYP11B2 (Table 1). Radiolabeled probe alone (FP; free probe) is shown in lane 1 of each panel. Lanes 2–4 of each panel correspond to labeled probe incubated with in vitro-translated NGFIB, Nurr1 or SF-1 as indicated. Probe incubated with H295R nuclear extract (NE; 1 μg) is shown in lane 5 of each panel. Nonradiolabeled self-competitor DNA was added to the nuclear extract reaction mixture in a 100-fold molar excess (NE + 100x) to identify nonspecific protein/DNA interactions (lane 6 of each panel). Protein/DNA complexes (C1–C4) were separated from free probe by gel electrophoresis. In panel 1, the protein/DNA complex designated C1 migrated with the complex formed by in vitro-translated NGFIB or Nurr1, whereas C2 migrated with the complex formed by SF-1. In panel 2, the C3 complex did not migrate with any of the in vitro proteins, whereas C4 migrated with the complex formed by SF-1. The unlabeled arrow in panel 2 denotes a protein that was present in the rabbit reticulocyte lysate extract used for in vitro protein preparation.

**Effects of Ang II Treatment upon Mutated NBRE-1, Ad5, and/or Ad1 hCYP11B2 cis-Elements**

A cAMP response element (CRE, sequence TGACGTGA), also called Ad1, is crucial for transcriptional regulation of the CYP11B genes of several species (22). To determine the relative role of the NBRE-1, Ad5, and Ad1/CRE cis-elements in agonist stimulation of hCYP11B2, we mutated all three elements alone or in combination in the context of the pB2-1521 luciferase construct. Wild-type and mutated constructs were transfected into H295R cells. After recovery, cells were treated or untreated with Ang II for 6 h, then lysed and assayed for luciferase activity. Mutation of the NBRE-1, Ad5, and Ad1/CRE cis-elements reduced both basal and Ang II-induced levels of hCYP11B2, demonstrating that all three elements are required for maximal transcriptional activity (Fig. 9). The fold induction by Ang II was similar in the wild-type hCYP11B2 (4.4-fold) and the mutated NBRE-1 (5.3-fold) and Ad5 (4-fold) constructs, whereas the Ad1/CRE mutant was induced by Ang II only 2.2-fold over basal. Ang II stimulated the hCYP11B2 triple mutant construct only 1.8-fold over basal, which was similar to that observed with the pGL3Basic empty vector (2-fold).

**DISCUSSION**

Temporally, the regulation of aldosterone biosynthesis can be divided into two phases. Acutely (minutes to hours after a stimulus), aldosterone production is controlled by the movement of cholesterol into the mitochondria, which is mediated by increased expression of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (23). Chronically (hours to days), aldosterone production is regulated at the level of expression of aldosterone synthase (CYP11B2). The studies reported here, together with previous work, provide a detailed picture (Fig. 10) of the mechanisms that control hCYP11B2 expression and thus, aldosterone biosynthesis.

Signaling Pathways that Regulate
CYP11B2 Expression

The primary regulators of CYP11B2 expression and aldosterone production are Ang II and potassium (K⁺) that act, in part, by increasing intracellular calcium ([Ca²⁺]i) (24). Ang II acts via the type 1 Ang II (AT1) receptor, which is coupled to Gq. Triggering the receptor activates phospholipase C-β, resulting in increased levels of diacylglycerol and inositol triphosphate (IP3); the latter mobilizes intracellular calcium stores (25). Potassium, on the other hand, increases [Ca²⁺]i through activation of voltage-sensitive L- and T-type Ca²⁺ channels, resulting in the influx of calcium from extracellular sources.

Whereas protein kinase C-dependent pathways activated by diacylglycerol apparently do not play a major role in the regulation of hCYP11B2 (26), increases in intracellular calcium activate CaM, which in turn activates several CaM-dependent protein kinases

(CaMKs). Calcium appears to act through CaMKI and possibly CaMKIV to regulate hCYP11B2 transcription (21). CaM and CaMKs also appear to regulate the acute steps of aldosterone production (27).

### Important cis-Elements in hCYP11B2

The cis-elements and trans-acting factors that regulate the differential expression of hCYP11B2 in the adrenal zona glomerulosa have been an area of ongoing study in this laboratory. We have identified three important cis-elements in the hCYP11B2 promoter: a CRE at −71/−64, a cis-element termed Ad5 at −129/−114 (19), and, herein, a third cis-element termed NBRE-1 (−766/−759). The CRE is common to both hCYP11B1 and hCYP11B2 and is regulated by both protein kinase A- and CaMK-dependent mechanisms.

Neither the NBRE-1 nor Ad5 cis-elements found in the 5′-flanking region of hCYP11B2 are present in hCYP11B1, making these elements likely candidates in the specific regulation of hCYP11B2. Herein, we found that mutation of either the NBRE-1 or Ad5 element dramatically decreased the basal levels of reporter construct expression and blunted maximal agonist stimulation. The NBRE-1 site is a nuclear receptor half-site that we demonstrate has the ability to bind NGFIB family members. The Ad5 cis-element represents a direct repeat of two nuclear receptor half-sites in tandem (DR-0), which we show can bind members of the NGFIB family as well as SF-1 and COUP-TF (chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter-transcription factor) (19).

The Ad1/CRE is highly conserved between species and is important for bovine, rodent (mouse, rat, ham-

ster) and human CYP11B2 gene activity (16, 17, 28–30, 19). Whereas sequence analysis of 2 kb of the mouse and hamster promoters failed to locate the −766/−759 NBRE-1 cis-element seen in hCYP11B2, variant and consensus NBREs were found more distal, at about −1500 bp, in the mouse and hamster promoters, respectively. However, the most intriguing of the cis-elements, the Ad5 site, does not appear to be conserved among CYP11B2 of different species (22). Thus, these data support the hypothesis that there are species variations in the key cis-elements regulating CYP11B2 gene transcription.

### Trans-Acting Factors Regulating CYP11B2

Previous work has shown that the hCYP11B2 CRE binds activating transcription factors, ATF-1 and ATF-2, and CRE binding protein (CREB) (31). Phosphorylation of ATF-1 and/or CREB by CaMKI and CaMKIV increases the ability of these factors to enhance gene transcription (32, 33). In a recent report, it was shown that mutation of the CRE was able to block CaMKI induction of hCYP11B2 reporter activity (21). Thus, it is likely that activated CaMKI phosphorylates ATF-1 and/or CREB leading to enhanced transcription of hCYP11B2.

We showed in the present study that treatment of H295R adrenal cells with Ang II and K⁺ rapidly and dramatically increased the levels of NGFIB and NURR1 mRNA and protein. Inhibition of the CaMKs with KN93 reduced agonist-stimulated NGFIB (only K⁺ stimulation), NURR1 and hCYP11B2 transcription. Activity of CaMKs are known to increase NGFIB expression in other cell model systems (34). We therefore propose that the effects of K⁺ and Ang II on

Fig. 10. Schematic Model Showing Ang II and K⁺ Regulation of hCYP11B2 Expression

The CRE (Ad1), Ad5 and NBRE-1 *cis*-elements are indicated. Ang II, acting through the type 1 Ang II receptor (AT1), and K⁺ increase intracellular calcium which, in turn, activates CaMKI and CaMKIV. CaMKI and/or CaMKIV phosphorylates ATF-1 and CREB, which increases binding to the hCYP11B2 CRE. Expression of NGFIB and NURR1 mRNA and protein are induced by Ang II, in part through the action of CaMKI and/or CaMKIV. NGFIB and/or NURR1 bind to the Ad5 and NBRE-1 *cis*-elements. Bound ATF-1/CREB and NGFIB/NURR1 activate hCYP11B2 gene expression. This increase in hCYP11B2 transcription directly determines the capacity of the adrenal glomerulosa to produce aldosterone.

hCYP11B2 transcription occurs through two pathways: increased expression of NURR1/NGFIB and phosphorylation of ATF-1/CREB (Fig. 10).

NGFIB is abundantly expressed in brain, thymus, muscle, and some peripheral tissues (35, 36), whereas NURR1 is expressed predominantly in the central nervous system, where it is responsible for the differentiation and maintenance of dopaminergic neurons (37, 38). NGFIB and NURR1 have been detected in human adrenal, and NURR1 has been localized to the murine adrenal zona glomerulosa by *in situ* hybridization (20). Herein, we found that NURR1 was expressed in the human adrenal glomerulosa and to a lesser degree in the fasciculata, whereas NGFIB was expressed in both fasciculata and glomerulosa zones.

Both NGFIB and NURR1 markedly increased transcription of hCYP11B2, but neither factor had any effect on transcription of hCYP11B1. This presumably reflects transcriptional regulation through the NBRE-1 and Ad5 sites, which are unique to hCYP11B2. The ability of NGFIB and NURR1 to regulate transcription of hCYP11B2 extends the role of these nuclear receptors in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Both NGFIB and NURR1 are known mediators of CRH function in the hypothalamus (39). In the adrenal, a role for NGFIB in the regulation of 21-hydroxylase (CYP21) transcription has been proposed (14, 15). The site of expression of each factor within the adrenal may influence the relative role of NGFIB or NURR1 on target gene selection. The overlap in expression and similarity in effects on gene transcription may explain why previous studies using targeted disruption of single NGFIB family members have not demonstrated an adrenal phenotype (37, 40). Nevertheless, these transcription factors are not functionally equivalent. Subtle changes in the consensus NBRE can differentially affect the trans-activation ability of each family member (41). Moreover, their activities, and consequently their functional roles *in vivo*, can be modulated by post-translational modifications and differing heterodimerization abilities (35, 42–45). Our data suggest that NURR1 may play the more specific role in hCYP11B2 regulation.

In summary, Ang II and K⁺ regulation of adrenal aldosterone production appears to converge on calcium signaling pathways (Fig. 10). Both agonists increase \([Ca^{2+}]_{i}\), the activation of CaM, CaM kinases, and the expression of NGFIB family members. NURR1 and/or NGFIB along with CRE-binding transcription factors subsequently increase the transcription of hCYP11B2 thus controlling the long-term capacity of the adrenal gland to produce aldosterone.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Preparation of Reporter Constructs and Expression Vectors

The hCYP11B1 (pB1-1102) and hCYP11B2 (pB2-1521) promoter constructs were previously described (9). The hCYP11B2 5′-deletion constructs were prepared using available restriction endonuclease sites or by PCR as described (19). For the NBRE-1 mutant construct, the sequence 5′-AAAGGCTA-3′ (−766/−759) was changed to 5′-gAAAttCTA-3′; for the Ad5 mutant construct, the sequence 5′-GACCTT-3′ (−119/−114) was changed to 5′-GAtaTc-3′; for the Ad1/CRE mutant construct, the sequence 5′-TGACGTGA-3′ was changed to 5′-gGtaccGA-3′ (Table 1). All bases were numbered relative to the hCYP11B2 transcriptional start site. Plasmids encoding rat NGFIB and mouse NURR1 were kindly provided by Colin Clyne (Prince Henry’s Institute of Medical Research, Victoria, Australia). A human SF-1 plasmid was provided by Meera Ramayya (University of Washington, Seattle, WA). All three coding sequences were subcloned into the pRc/RSV expression plasmid (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) or into pcDNA3.1 Zeo+ (Invitrogen).

Cell Culture and Transfection Assay

Cell culture and transfection assays were carried out as previously described except that Transfast (Promega, Madison, WI) was used as the transfection reagent according to the manufacturer’s protocol (9).

RNA Extraction and Northern Blot Analysis

Total RNA was extracted from cells using the Ultraspec RNA isolation system (Biotecx Laboratories Inc., Houston, TX) and aliquots (10 μg) were resolved by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose/formaldehyde gel. RNA was transferred to a nylon membrane (Hybond-N+, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Inc., Piscataway, NJ) by blotting overnight at 10 V and cross-linked under UV light. Prehybridization was carried out overnight at 42 C in formamide prehybridization/hybridization solution supplemented with 50 mM NaH₂PO₄, 0.5 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA and 5% dextran sulfate. The membrane was hybridized with a NGFIB or NURR1 cDNA probe (Rediprime II; Amersham) in formamide prehybridization/hybridization solution supplemented with 20 mM NaH₂PO₄, 0.25 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA and 10% dextran sulfate at 42 C overnight. The membrane was washed in 0.1× SSC (sodium chloride/sodium citrate)/0.1% SDS (sodium dodecyl sulfate) twice each at room temperature and at 42 C and then exposed to x-ray film. The membrane was subsequently rehybridized with ³²P-radiolabeled 18S probe to confirm equal loading of RNA samples.

Western Blot Analysis

Nuclear extracts were prepared from H295R cells untreated or treated with Ang II as described (8). PAGE was carried out using precast 4–12% bis-Tris NuPage gels (Novex, San Diego, CA). After electrophoresis, proteins were electrophoretically transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes for 1 h at 25 V. After transfer, the membranes were incubated with NGFIB (1:500) or NURR1 (1:1000) antibodies overnight at 4 C. The NGFIB antibody (catalog no. 1600045) was obtained from Geneka Biotechnology (Montreal, Quebec, Canada) and the NURR1 antibody (sc-991) was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). In addition to the manufacturer’s characterization, we tested both antibodies for specificity using in vitro-translated NGFIB or NURR1. Membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Immunoreactive bands were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting detection reagents from Amersham Biosciences (Piscataway, NJ).

EMSA

H295R nuclear extracts were prepared and EMSA was carried out, as described, with certain modifications (8). For NBRE-1, 0.1 mg/ml poly(dG-dC) (deoxyguanosine-deoxycytidine) was added to the binding buffer as nonspecific competitor. For the Ad5 probe, binding was carried out in 25 mM Tris, 100 mM KCl, 0.125% Nonidet P-40, 15% glycerol, 2.5 mM dithiothreitol, and 0.05 mg/ml poly(dI-dC) deoxynosine-deoxycytidine). After binding, the resulting DNA/protein complexes were separated from free probe by electrophoresis through a 4% native polyacrylamide gel in either 1× Tris-glycine (NBRE-1) or 0.50× Tris-borate-EDTA (Ad5) running buffer. The gel was dried and visualized after autoradiography at −70 C for 24 h. Rat NGFIB, mouse NURR1, and human SF-1 were prepared using an in vitro transcription/translation system (Promega). The hCYP11B2-specific NBRE-1 (−766/−759) and Ad5 (−129/−114) wild-type oligonucleotide sequences used for EMSA are listed in Table 1.

Immunolocalization of NGFIB and NURR1 in Human Adrenal Cortex

Nonpathologic human adrenals were retrieved from autopsy files of Tohoku University Hospital (Sendai, Japan). Tissues were fixed in 10% formalin and embedded in paraffin. Histological examinations revealed no significant pathologic abnormalities including nodules or neoplasms. Review of the charts revealed that these patients had not received any forms of adrenocortical steroids before their demise. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies for NURR1 (sc-991, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and NGFIB (NAK1/Nur77;1600045, Geneka Biotechnology) were used for immunohistochemical analysis employing the streptavidin-biotin amplification method and a Histofine Kit (Nichirei, Tokyo, Japan). Briefly, deparaffinized sections were pretreated by heating the slides in an autoclave at 120 C for 5 min in citric acid buffer [3 mM citric acid and 9 mM trisodium citrate dehydrate (pH 6.0)]. The slides were then treated with 1% normal goat serum for 20 min at room temperature and incubated with anti-NURR1 (dilution; 1/250) or anti-NGFIB (dilution: 1/200) for 18 h at 4 C. The slides were subsequently reacted with Envision (DAKO,

### RNA Extraction and Real-Time RT-PCR

Total RNA was extracted from tissue, using the method of Chirgwin (46), followed by deoxyribonuclease I treatment. Two micrograms of total RNA were reverse transcribed using the High Capacity cDNA Archive Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Primers and probes for real-time RT-PCR were designed using the Primer Express computer program (Applied Biosystems) (Table 2). For NGFIB or NURR1 quantitation, a double-stranded DNA dye, SYBR Green I (Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR) was used along with 15 μl 2× SYBR Green Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) and 0.1 μM of each primer. hCYP11B2 and 18S quantitation were performed using a TaqMan Ribosomal RNA Reagent kit (Applied Biosystems) and 10 μl of primer/probe mix. For CYP11B2, the final concentrations of primer and probe used were 0.1 μM each. For 18S, the final concentrations of primer and probe were 0.05 μM and 0.1 μM, respectively. All real-time RT-PCRs were carried out, in two steps, using the ABI Prism 7000 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems) and the dissociation protocol. Step 1: 50°C for 2 min followed by 95°C for 10 min, one cycle. Step 2: 95°C for 15 sec, followed by 60°C for 60 sec, 40 cycles. Standard curve cDNA plasmids for NGFIB, NURR1, and CYP11B2 were used to quantitate transcript levels. As an internal standard, each individual sample was normalized to its 18S ribosomal RNA content. mRNA levels were expressed as attomoles per microgram 18S rRNA.
