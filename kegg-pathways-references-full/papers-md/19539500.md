ABSTRACT

Viral and microbial pathogens contain specific motifs or pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) that are recognized by cell surface- and endosome-associated Toll-like receptors (TLRs). RNA virus infection is also detected through TLR-independent mechanisms. Early viral replicative intermediates are detected by two recently characterized cytosolic viral RNA receptors—RIG-I and MDA-5. Both are DExDH/box RNA helicases, and RIG-I specifically recognizes 5′-triphosphate containing viral RNA and transmits signals that induce type I interferon-mediated host immunity against virus infection. In this review, we will focus on RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) signal transduction and the regulatory mechanisms – ubiquitination, deubiquitination, ISGylation – underlying this important host response.

1. Introduction

The past decade has witnessed tremendous progress in our understanding of the innate host response to infection and the pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that sense and respond to infectious pathogens. Three major classes of PRRs are involved in the detection of invading pathogens: nucleotide-oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors, Toll-like receptors (TLRs), and retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs) [1–3]. These sensors are part of a first line of immune defense that sense exogenous pathogens via pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), leading to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and type I interferons (IFNs). Type I IFN production provokes swift eradication of invading pathogens by stimulating both antiviral immunity and triggering adaptive immunity.

TLRs are transmembrane proteins implicated in the detection of a vast range of microbial pathogens including viruses, bacteria, protozoa, and fungi. TLR signaling is achieved by the recognition of specific PAMPs via extracellular leucine-rich repeat (LRR) motifs that transmit signals through the cytoplasmic Toll-interleukin (IL)-1 receptor (TIR) domain [4,5]. Among the TLR family, a subgroup of endosome localized TLRs (TLR3, 7, 8, 9) detect nucleic acids particularly viral DNA/RNA and can be distinguished from surface expressed TLRs (TLR1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 10) that recognize bacterial and fungal cell wall components, as well as some viral proteins [6]. TLR3 is known to detect double-stranded (ds) RNA, while TLR7 and TLR8 recognize single-stranded (ss) RNA and TLR9 recognizes unmethylated DNA with CpG motifs [7–10]. Endosomal TLRs, upon binding to their respective ligands, recruit downstream adaptor molecules such as MyD88 and TIR domain-containing adaptor inducing IFN-β (TRIF) leading to NF-κB and IFN activation [11]. Among the cytoplasmic PRRs, NLRs are known to detect cytosolic microbial components and “danger” signals (such as ATP and toxins) through their characteristic C-terminal LRR and internal nucleotide-binding domain (NBD), leading to the activation of the inflammasome, a large multiprotein complex whose assembly activates caspase-1, promoting the maturation of pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and IL-18 [1,12].

Recently, several groups have identified another cytoplasmic sensor, the PYHIN (pyrin and HIN domain-containing protein) family member absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2) as the key sensor for cytoplasmic dsDNA [13–16]. Cytoplasmic DNA triggers formation of the AIM2 inflammasome by inducing AIM2 oligomerization, leading to activation of the (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD) ASC pyroptosome and caspase-1 [14].

Distinct from the TLR pathways, RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) – the retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation-associated gene-5 (MDA-5) – are novel cytoplasmic RNA helicases that recognize viral RNA present within the cytoplasm. Although both TLR7 and TLR9 are critical for recognition of viral nucleic acids in the endosomes of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), most other cell types recognize viral RNA

intermediates through the RLR arm of the innate immune response [17-19]. This review will focus on how RLRs detect viral RNA, discriminate between exogenous viral and endogenous self-RNA, and how the host regulates the antiviral response by modulation of RLR-mediated signaling.

2. Recognition of RNA viruses by RLRs

RIG-I and MDA-5 are closely related proteins that belong to the DExD/H box RNA helicase family and contain two amino (N)-terminal caspase recruitment domains (CARDs), a central ATPase and helicase domain and a carboxy C-terminal regulatory domain [17] (Fig. 1). The importance of the RIG-I pathway in antiviral immunity was confirmed with the generation of RIG-I-deficient mice [20], revealing that RIG-I and not the TLR system played an essential role in the IFN antiviral response in most cell types—fibroblasts, epithelial and conventional dendritic cells. In contrast, pDCs, known as robust producers of IFN-α, utilize TLR-mediated signaling in preference to RIG-I [20]. Initially, both RIG-I and MDA-5 were thought to detect poly-cytidylic acid (poly I:C); however, the generation of RIG-I and MDA-5-deficient mice revealed that these two cystolic RNA sensors are not functionally redundant [21]. Specifically, RIG-I is a sensor for hepatitis C virus (HCV), Sendai virus (SeV), influenza virus, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), Newcastle disease virus (NDV), rabies virus, and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), while MDA-5 appears to detect picornaviruses and is responsible for the IFN response generated by poly I:C stimulation [21,22].

Several viruses are differentially recognized based upon the length of viral dsRNA produced following infection. For example, Reovirus genomic RNA contains distinct lengths of dsRNA fragments, with long dsRNA (>1 kb) fragments inducing IFN production in an MDA-5-dependent manner, and short dsRNAs (<1 kb) in a RIG-I dependent manner [23,24]. RIG-I recognizes form A of dsRNA irrespective of the nucleotide sequence or the end structure (blunt, 5′-overhang or 3′-overhang). In addition, viruses such as Dengue and West Nile Virus belonging to the Flaviviridae family induce type I IFN production in both RIG-I and MDA-5 knockout murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), suggesting that a combination of both receptors may recognize some viruses [23,25].

RIG-I distinguishes viral RNA from cellular RNAs by recognizing a 5′-triphosphate modification that arises during viral RNA synthesis, a modification that is not found on normal capped or processed cellular RNA [26–28]. Furthermore, abundant cellular RNAs such as tRNAs and rRNAs are extensively modified with unusual bases such as pseudouridine that prevent activation of RIG-I and MDA-5 [26]. In addition, *in vitro* biochemical assays have revealed that short dsRNA of approximately 25 bp with a minimum of a single phosphate at either 5′- or 3′-ends can trigger RIG-I signaling [29]. Moreover, dsRNA must have a blunt end or a 5′-overhang to overcome the unwinding activity of RIG-I and stably exist as a complex [29]. Collectively, these results suggest that RIG-I signaling distinguishes foreign from host RNA by recognizing 5′-triphosphate RNA, as well as short dsRNA. Interestingly, viruses such as Hantaa virus, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus and Borna disease virus fail to trigger RIG-I signaling and were shown to modify the 5′-triphosphate group by a post-transcriptional mechanism, thus effectively evading the initiation of the innate immune response [30].

Interestingly, RIG-I-deficient mice generated by Kato et al. were embryonic lethal due to liver degeneration [20]; however, a RIG-I knockout strain made by Wang et al. using a different gene targeting strategy was viable and resulted in mice that develop a colitis-like phenotype associated with the downregulation of the G protein subunit Gi2α and subsequent abnormal T cell activation [31]. Interestingly, the intracellular pathogen sensor NOD2 has been implicated in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD); several mutations

in the gene that encodes for the NOD2 protein have been identified in a subgroup of patients with Crohn’s disease [32]. RIG-I may regulate Gai2 expression, and RIG-I deficiency may also contribute to the pathogenesis of IBD [33]. Furthermore, RIG-I is involved in negative regulation of granulocytic proliferation [34], and the initiation of progressive myeloproliferative disorder is due to an intrinsic defect in RIG-I knockout myeloid cells characterized by reduced expression of IFN consensus sequence binding protein, a major regulator of myeloid differentiation [34]. Altogether, these studies highlight that RIG-I is not only involved in sensing virus RNA, but may be essential for development.

3. Molecular structure of RIG-I

RIG-I protein is present in the cytoplasm in an inactive form and is activated by viral infection or transfection of dsRNA. A mutant of RIG-I containing only the N-terminal CARD domain functions as a constitutive activator that induces IFN production in the absence of viral infection, whereas a CARD-deficient mutant of RIG-I functions as a dominant negative inhibitor [17,35]. Mutagenesis of the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding residue of the helicase domain from lysine to alanine (K270A) completely blocks signaling to downstream components, suggesting that ATP hydrolysis is necessary for the unmasking of the RIG-I CARD domains [17]. The C-terminal portion of RIG-I encodes for a repressor domain (RD) (aa 735–925) that is also found LGP2, another RLR family member related to RIG-I and MDA-5 (Fig. 1). LGP2 differs from RIG-I and MDA-5 by the lack of the two N-terminal CARDs but shares the DExH box ATPase domain and a C-terminal RD and functions as a negative regulator of host defense [18,36,37]. All three enzymes share seven conserved sequence motifs referred to as “helicase motifs” that mediate ATP and nucleic acid binding. In resting cells, RIG-I is maintained as a monomer in an autoinhibited state; upon viral RNA binding, RIG-I undergoes a conformational change that leads to dimerization and interaction with the downstream adaptor molecule MAVS/IPS-1/VISA/CARDIF via CARD–CARD interactions [38–41]. RIG-I self-governs its own multimerization by an internal repressor domain that functions as an autoinhibitor in the absence of viral infection [36]. RIG-I exhibits helicase activity toward dsRNA and RNA/DNA duplexes with a 3′ RNA overhang in an ATP-dependent manner, whereas RNAs with a blunt end or 5′ overhang are resistant to unwinding by RIG-I but efficiently induce IFN production [29]. These observations suggest that a stable complex formation between RIG-I and substrate RNA is necessary for RIG-I activation and IFN signaling. A C-terminal regulatory domain (CTD) (aa 792–925) overlapping the RD of RIG-I binds viral RNA in a 5′-triphosphate-dependent manner and activates RIG-I ATPase inducing RNA-dependent dimerization [29,42]. NMR structural analysis of the CTD revealed a zinc-binding domain that is structurally related to the GDP/GTP exchange factors of Rab-like GTPases and is essential for RIG-I signaling *in vivo* [29,42]. Furthermore, structure-guided mutagenesis of the CTD identified a conserved lysine at the bottom of a positively charged groove as the likely recognition motif for RNA 5′-triphosphates. Interestingly, this lysine and other features of the recognition groove are different in LGP2 and MDA-5, suggesting that the CTD of the three receptors may be a specificity determinant for different viral ligands [42]. Reconstitution of RIG-I knockout MEFs with point mutants of this basic surface (KK858/861AA and KK888/907AA) impairs dsRNA and 5′ppp ssRNA binding and inhibits RIG-I signaling [29].

helicase domain of RIG-I (Fig. 1). In contrast, the C-terminal end of MDA-5 does not contain a RD and shows no autoinhibitory function [18,36]. As mentioned previously, generation of RIG-I and MDA-5 knockout mice demonstrated that these sensors detect different viruses [20,21]. In addition, a genome-wide association study of nonsynonymous SNPs identified MDA-5 as a gene locus associated with type I diabetes, thus linking another immune sensing receptor with autoimmune disorders. Ectopic expression also revealed that MDA-5 may be involved in growth inhibition and apoptosis in several tumor cell lines, suggesting the both RIG-I and MDA-5 possess functions beyond the scope of viral RNA sensing [43]. Furthermore, Poliovirus infection triggers MDA-5 cleavage in a proteasome- and caspase-dependent manner; degradation of MDA-5 during poliovirus infection correlates with cleavage of poly(ADP) ribose polymerase (PARP), a hallmark of apoptosis and thus may represent a mechanism to antagonize production of type I interferon in response to Poliovirus infection [44].

Distinct from the roles of RIG-I and MDA-5 as positive regulators of the innate immune response, the CARD-deficient third member of the RLR family, LGP2, has been suggested to be a negative regulator of dsRNA signaling that inhibits virus-induced activation of IFN genes [18,36,45,46]. LGP2 shows a 31% and 41% aa homology to the helicase domain of MDA-5 and RIG-I, respectively (Fig. 1). The negative regulatory function of LGP2 can be attributed to the inhibition of RIG-I through RD interactions that block RIG-I self-association, possibly by disrupting homotypic CARD/helicase domain and/or C terminus interactions [36]. Moreover, LGP2 regulates the RIG-I signaling pathways at multiple steps, indirectly through sequestration of RNA substrates [18,46] or through disruption the MAVS signaling complex [45]. LGP2 negatively regulates SeV and NDV-mediated IFN-β gene activation and RNAi-mediated knockdown of LGP2 enhances antiviral gene expression. Recent crystallography and in vitro and in vivo biochemical analysis have shown that the LGP2 CTD modulates RIG-I-dependent signaling via competition for dsRNA independent of 5′-triphosphates, while a fully functional LGP2 is required to augment MDA-5-dependent signaling [47]. In contrast, another study demonstrates that helicase enzymatic activity and RNA binding were dispensable for LGP2 mediated signaling inhibition, thus supporting an RNA independent interference mechanism [48].

The generation of LGP2 knockout mice resulted in a complex phenotype [49]. As expected, LGP2 knockout mice exhibited resistance to VSV infection, since replicative RNA intermediates of VSV are recognized by RIG-I rather than by MDA-5. However, in contrast to the role of LGP2 as a negative regulator, LGP2-deficient mice exhibited a defect in type I IFN production in response to infection by equine cytomegalovirus (ECMV), suggesting a positive role for LGP2 in antiviral signaling in response to picornavirus [49]. Further mechanistic studies are required to clarify the physiological role of LGP2 in the innate immune system.

### 5. RIG-I signal transduction through the mitochondrial MAVS adaptor

The adaptor molecule that provides a link between RIG-I sensing of incoming viral RNA and downstream activation events was independently elucidated as mitochondrial antiviral signaling adaptor (MAVS), also known as (IPS-1/VISA/Cardif) [38–41]. MAVS consists of an amino-terminal CARD domain, a proline-rich region (PRR) in the middle of the protein, and a C-terminal transmembrane domain (TM) that localized MAVS to the mitochondrial membrane, suggesting a critical function for the mitochondria as a signaling platform (Fig. 1). MAVS expression activated the IFN-α, IFN-β, and NF-κB promoters in a TBK1-dependent manner [39]. MAVS interacts with RIG-I via its CARD domain and recruits IKKε through its C-terminal region; knockdown by siRNA inhibited RIG-I dependent antiviral responses [41,50]. Importantly, MAVS – termed Cardif by Meylan et al. – was cleaved at its C-terminal end, adjacent to the mitochondrial targeting domain – by the NS3-4A protease of hepatitis C virus [41], arguing that disruption of the mitochondrial association of MAVS was part of the innate immune evasion strategy used by HCV [50–52].

The generation of MAVS-deficient mice demonstrated that loss of MAVS abolished viral induction of IFN and prevented activation of NF-κB and IRF-3 in multiple cell types, except pDCs [53,54]. MAVS is critically required for the host response to RNA viruses but is not required for IFN production by cystolic DNA [55] or by *Listeria monocytogenes*. Mice lacking MAVS are viable and fertile, but are severely compromised in immune defense against viral infection. These results provide in vivo evidence

that viral signaling through mitochondrial bound MAVS is specifically required for innate immune responses against viral infection [53, 54].

6. Adaptors involved in RIG-I signaling

6.1. TRAF3

The activation of RIG-I/MDA-5 ultimately leads to the TM-dependent dimerization of the MAVS N-terminal CARD domains, thereby providing an interface for direct binding to and activation of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor (TRAF) family members that are involved in both the IFN and NF-κB arms of the innate immune response [56, 57]. MAVS regulation of type I IFN induction is achieved by direct and specific interaction between the TRAF domain of TRAF3 and a TRAF-interaction motif (TIM) within MAVS; point-mutation of two critical amino acids (Y440A/Q442A) in the TRAF domain of TRAF3 prevented association with MAVS and completely abolished TRAF3-dependent IFN production following viral infection [58]. In addition, TRAF3 knockout cells showed substantial impairment of virus-induced IFN-α production indicating its indispensable role in RLR signaling [58, 59]. Following recruitment of TRAF3 to the signaling complex, the RING-domain of TRAF3 – which is responsible for its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity – preferentially assembles Lysine-63 polyubiquitin chains, thus forming a scaffold for the assembly of a signaling complex composed of IKKε and TBK1 [60], leading to the activation of transcription factors IRF-3/IRF-7 [61, 62] (Fig. 2).

6.2. TRAF2 and TRAF6

Similar to TRAF3, TRAF2 and TRAF6 interact with MAVS [40]. Although binding of TRAF6 with MAVS has been demonstrated, the role of the TRAF6 pathway in IFN-α/β production has not been fully understood; a recent report demonstrated that activation of NF-κB, JNK, and p38 were impaired in TRAF6-deficient MEFs in response to VSV and poly I:C [63]. Furthermore, this study suggested that MAVS requires TRAF6 and the MAP3K, MEKK1 to activate NF-κB and mitogen-activated protein kinases for optimal induction of type I IFNs [63]. In keeping with the role of TRAF6 in RIG-I signaling, myeloid DCs and fibroblasts following SeV infection mediate activation of P38 MAPK through a TRAF2 and TAK1-dependent pathway. The activation of P38 MAPK in turn promote IL-12 production and enhances type I IFN induction [64].

6.3. TANK and NAP-1

Both TRAF-family member associated NF-κB activator (TANK), also named I-TRAF and NAK-associated protein 1 (NAP-1) are adaptor proteins involved in IRF activation in response to virus infection [65, 66]. TANK acts as a multi-domain scaffolding protein that brings together elements of the IRF and NF-κB pathway, promoting activation of both the IKK complex and IKK-related kinases. NAP-1 is a ubiquitously expressed cytoplasmic protein that interacts with both IKKε and TBK-1 and facilitates IRF-3 activation and IFN-β induction following VSV infection [66].

6.4. SIKE

Using a yeast-two hybrid screen with full-length IKKε as bait, suppressor of IKKε (SIKE) was identified as an inhibitor of the IFN pathway [67]. The coiled-coil (CC) domains of SIKE mediated homologous interactions with the C-termini of TBK-1 and IKKε, which contain two potential CC domains. Forced expression of SIKE

inhibited the IFN response following TLR-3 or RIG-I engagement without an effect on NF-κB activity. In non-stimulated cells, SIKE was constitutively associated with TBK-1, but poly I:C or VSV treatment led to dissociation of this complex and induction of the IFN response.

6.5. NEMO/IKKγ

NEMO/IKKγ, a regulatory subunit for the canonical IKK complex, serves as a bridge to the NF-κB and IRF signaling pathways and promotes cross-talk between the two pathways during virus-and RIG-I-mediated signaling to IFN activation [68]. NEMO acts downstream of MAVS and RIG-I, and physically interacts with the TANK adaptor to mediate recruitment of TBK1 and IKKε to the RIG-I–MAVS complex (Fig. 2). Virus-mediated production of endogenous IFN and IFN-inducible gene expression is severely impaired in *Ikbkg−/−* MEFs and expression of MAVS or constitutively active RIG-I (*ΔRIG-I*) in *Ikbkg−/−* MEFs fails to stimulate IFN signaling. Furthermore, NEMO mutants lacking the TANK-binding domain fail to interact with IKKε and TBK1 or transduce virus- and MAVS-mediated signals [68].

6.6. FADD, RIP1, TRADD, and Caspase 8/10

Interestingly, Fas-associated death domain (FADD) and receptor interacting protein 1 (RIP1), known mediators of death-receptor signaling, are also implicated in the antiviral pathway [38, 69] These death domain-containing molecules interact with the C-terminal portion of MAVS and induce NF-κB via interaction and activation of caspase-8 and caspase-10 [38, 70]. Both caspases are cleaved during dsRNA stimulation, and overexpression of a cleaved form of these caspases is sufficient to activate NF-κB; additionally, cells derived from caspase-8-deficient mice showed reduced expression of inflammatory cytokines as well as NF-κB activation, illustrating the importance of both caspases as essential components of the NF-κB arm of RIG-I signaling [70]. Moreover, TRADD, a crucial adaptor of tumor necrosis factor receptor-1 (TNFR-I), was shown to be recruited to MAVS following virus infection, coordinating the assembly of a signaling complex composed of TRAF3 and TANK and with FADD and RIP1, leading to the activation of IRF3 and NF-κB [71] (Fig. 2).

6.7. STING/MITA/MPYS

The recent discovery of a novel protein called stimulator of interferon genes (STING) [72], also known as (MITA/MPYS) [73, 74], added a new component to the antiviral pathway. STING/MITA, composed of four transmembrane domains (Fig. 1), was shown to be expressed on the outer mitochondrial membrane whereby nucleic acid binding to RIG-I triggered complex formation between MAVS and MITA, leading to the recruitment of TBK1 and subsequent phosphorylation of IRF-3 [73]. However, the Barber group reported that STING was localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) via its transmembrane domains [72]. Although STING interacted directly with RIG-I, it was unable to co-immunoprecipitate with MDA-5 or respond to poly I:C-mediated IFN activation [72]. Furthermore, STING-deficient MEFs were unable to induce IFN-β production in response to transfected B-form DNA (poly dA-dT), while no significant defect in IFN-β production was observed in response to poly I:C or lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Other reported differences were that STING co-immunoprecipitates with the components of the TRAP complex (TRAPβ) and the translocon adaptor SEC61β whose cellular function involves protein translocation across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane following translation [75]. This observation led the authors to suggest that STING may link the RIG-I molecule to the translocon so it may

Fig. 2. RIG-I-like receptor (RLR)-mediated signaling and regulation. Short viral dsRNA or 5′-triphosphate RNA is selectively recognized by the basic cleft-like structure of C-terminal domain (CTD) of RIG-I inducing ATP-dependent conformational changes that allow dimerization and association with the downstream adaptor molecule MAVS via CARD-CARD interactions. Following MAVS engagement by RLRs, MAVS recruits downstream signaling complexes composed of TRAF3/TANK/NEMO/NAP1/TBK1/IKKε and TRADD/TRAF6/TRAF2/RIP1/FADD/Caspase 8-10/NEMO/TANK/IKKα/IKKβ that lead to the activation of the IFN-regulatory factors (IRFs) and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), respectively. In addition, RIG-I signaling recruits the adaptor molecule STING/MITA/MPYS which is associated with a translocon exocyst complex at the ER or the mitochondria leading to TBK1 recruitment and subsequent type I IFN induction. RIG-I signaling is negatively or positively regulated by numerous E3 ubiquitin ligases (TRIM25α, Riplet, RNF125) and de-ubiquitinase enzymes (DUBA, A20, CYLD).

detect translating viral RNAs to induce antiviral immunity via the exocyst-recruited TBK1 [72]. Jin et al. independently located the identical molecule termed MPYS, to both the mitochondria and the plasma membrane and found an alternate function whereby MPYS associates with major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC II) and mediates transduction of apoptotic signals via ERK activation [74]. A full understanding of the role of STING/MITA/MPYS in innate immune signaling awaits further investigation.

### 7. Regulation of RLR signaling by ubiquitination

Activation of RLRs results in the dissemination of an antiviral cascade necessary to combat invading pathogens [76]. Thus, limiting the intensity and duration RLR signaling is essential to prevent this protective response from causing injury to the host. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of ubiquitination in modulating the innate immune response in response to invading pathogens in both the TLR and RLR signaling pathways. TRIM25α,
a member of the tripartite motif (TRIM) protein family involved in various cellular processes including cell proliferation and antiviral activity, is crucial for RIG-I-mediated signaling events through its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity [77]. TRIM25α contains a RING-finger domain, a B box/coiled-coil domain and SPRY domain and induces robust ubiquitination of the CARD domains of RIG-I. The carboxy-terminal SPRY domain of TRIM25α interacts with the N-terminal CARDs of RIG-I; this interaction delivers the Lys 63-linked ubiquitin moiety to the N-terminal CARDs of RIG-I, resulting in marked increase of RIG-I downstream signaling activity. The Lys 172 residue of RIG-I is critical for efficient TRIM25α-mediated ubiquitination and for MAVS binding, as well as the ability of RIG-I to induce antiviral signal transduction. Gene targeting demonstrated that TRIM25α is essential, not only for RIG-I ubiquitination, but also for RIG-I-mediated IFN activation and antiviral activity in response to RNA virus infection. Moreover, TRIM25α-mediated ubiquitination of RIG-I appears to facilitate interaction with MAVS, which ultimately leads to downstream signal transduction. TRIM25α does not induce ubiquitination of MDA-5 and thus far it is not known whether ubiquitination is a requirement for interaction between MDA-5 and MAVS.

Recently, another E3 ubiquitin ligase Riplet/RNF135, was shown to promote lysine 63-linked polyubiquitination of the C-terminal region of RIG-I, enhancing IFNβ production in the early phase of viral infection [78]. Interestingly, Riplet/RNF135 shows sequence similarity to TRIM25α and contains C-terminal SPRY and PRY motifs. In contrast, Riplet/RNF135 promotes lysine 63-linked polyubiquitination of the C-terminal region of RIG-I, whereas TRIM25α mediates ubiquitination of the N-terminal CARD domains of RIG-I [78]. RIG-I also undergoes lysine 48-linked polyubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation by the E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF125 [79]. Moreover, RNF125 conjugates ubiquitin to MDA-5 and MAVS, thus inhibiting the assembly of the downstream antiviral signaling complex [79].

In addition to ubiquitination, ISGylation is also an important factor in dampening RIG-I signaling [80,81]. The conjugation of ubiquitin-like ISG15 to RIG-I reduced levels of both basal and virus-induced IFN-β promoter activity [81]. In Ube1L-deficient MEFs, which lack the ability to conjugate ISG15, basal levels of both RIG-I protein and transcripts increased compared to those in wild-type cells, resulting in enhanced production of ISGs and enhanced IFN-β promoter activity. The ubiquitin E2 conjugating enzyme, Ubch8 was found to be the link between both ubiquitin and ISG15 conjugation to RIG-I [82]. Ubch8 suppresses RIG-I ubiquitination by RNF125, and this suppression is relieved by ectopic expression of ISG15 thus regulating RNF125 E3 ligase activity [82].

These observations have focused on molecules that either inhibit or promote RIG-I signaling via ubiquitination events, but MDA-5 is also subject to specific regulation by the MDA-5 specific negative regulator dihydroxyacetone kinase (DAK) [83]. DAK specifically interacts with MDA-5, not RIG-I, consistent with the observation that ectopic expression of DAK inhibited MDA-5 – but not RIG-I – or TLR3-mediated IFNβ induction. The detailed mechanism on how MDA-5 is inhibited by DAK needs further clarification [83]. Altogether, regulation of the RLR signaling via post-translational modifications represents a pivotal point in modulating the antiviral cascade.

In contrast to ubiquitination, deubiquitinating enzymes that remove Lysine-63 linked ubiquitin are emerging as negative regulators of the IFN and NF-κB pathways. The deubiquitinating enzyme A (DUBA), a novel OTU-domain DUB has been shown to negatively regulate IFN signaling following RIG-I, MDA-5 or TLR3 stimulation [60]. DUBA specifically removes Lysine-63 linked ubiquitin chains from TRAF3, resulting in the disruption of interaction between TRAF3 and the downstream kinases IKKε and TBK1 and subsequent blockade of IRF-3 and IRF-7 phosphorylation [60]. Surprisingly, DUBA had no effect on processing of the NF-κB precursor NF-κB2/p100 into the active subunit p52, although TRAF3 is intimately involved in the non-canonical NF-κB pathway. Other deubiquitinating enzymes include the NF-κB-inducible ubiquitin-editing protein A20, a dual-purpose molecule possessing both deubiquitinase and ubiquitin E3 ligase activity. Three different groups have demonstrated that A20 is a negative regulator of IRF-3/-7 activation via the TLR3 and RIG-I pathways [35,84,85]. A20 is a potent inhibitor of RIG-I activation of the IFN pathway, with A20 completely inhibiting IRF-3 phosphorylation and DNA binding induced by an active form of RIG-I. A20 appears to act upstream of the kinases TBK-1/IKKε and the C-terminal region of A20 was essential for the inhibition of RIG-I signaling [35]. Recently, the deubiquitinating enzyme CYLD has been shown to negatively regulate ubiquitination of the RIG-I RNA sensor and thus inhibit the IFN response [86,87]. CYLD associates with both RIG-I and MAVS, inhibiting RIG-I signaling by disassociation of Lysine-63 ubiquitin moieties of RIG-I, thus serving as a counterbalance to the positive function of TRIM25α [86,87]. Interestingly, the autophagy regulator (Atg5–Atg12 conjugate), has also been shown to negatively regulate the type I IFN production pathway by direct association with RIG-I and MAVS through CARD–CARD interactions [88]. Thus, in contrast to the bactericidal properties of autophagic processes, the autophagy regulator appears to promote RNA virus replication by inhibiting innate antiviral immune responses.

The localization of MAVS to the mitochondria has generated significant interest in whether this organelle acts as a platform for protein assembly during the innate response or whether it also participates in virus-induced apoptotic decisions [51]. Two independent studies identified a member of the NLR family, NLRX1 as an important modulator of the innate immune response [89,90]. Both reports localize NLRX1 to the outer mitochondrial membrane but differ in the proposed function. The Ting group identifies NLRX1 as an inhibitor of mitochondrial antiviral signaling via interaction with its highly conserved nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) and the CARD domain of MAVS, resulting in the disruption virus-induced RLR-MAVS interactions [89]. In contrast, NLRX1 has also been reported to be a positive regulator of the innate immune system. The Girardin group found that NLRX1 resulted in amplified activity of NF-κB, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK); furthermore, NLRX1 increased ROS production induced by poly I:C, TNF, and Shigella infection [90]. These diverging functions will have to await the generation of NLRX1-deficient mice to determine the physiological function of NLRX1 in antiviral signaling. Overall, RLR signaling is composed of numerous “checks and balances” to ensure a well-tuned innate immune response and to prevent the occurrence of a state of hyper-inflammation to cause injury to the host.

8. Conclusions and perspectives

Studies in this rapidly moving field over the past 5 years have defined a dynamic cystolic recognition pathway that triggers a robust innate immune response against RNA virus infection. Also emerging as rapidly are details of the strategies used by different viruses to thwart these defense mechanisms. Many questions still remain unanswered: what are the molecular structures of RNAs recognized by MDA-5; how does RLR signaling access viral ribonucleoprotein complexes following infection; what is the precise mechanism by which the various viral proteins of RNA viruses regulate RLR signaling. Future research in this domain will contribute to an understanding of the molecular aspects of viral pathogenesis and promote strategic development of vaccines and antiviral agents.
