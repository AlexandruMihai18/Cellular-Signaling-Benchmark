### Perspectives

fashion, >95% of all adults are infected benignly for life<sup>8</sup>. Persistent infection is characterized by stable numbers of latently infected B cells in the blood (0.5–50 per million, depending on the individual<sup>9</sup>) and the steady shedding of infectious virus into saliva. The virus is continuously monitored by the immune system, as stable levels of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and serum antibodies to lytic and latent-stage proteins accompany persistent infection<sup>8,10,11</sup>. However, there is a dark side to this seemingly inoffensive virus. A simple mutation in a small and apparently insignificant signalling molecule, the SLAM-associated protein (*SH2D1A*/SAP)<sup>12,13</sup>, diverts EBV infection from benign persistence to the acutely aggressive disease, X-linked lymphoproliferative disease (*XLP*), which rapidly kills the infected individual<sup>14,15</sup> (BOX 1). Indeed, EBV is associated with a number of neoplastic diseases, including lymphomas and carcinomas (BOX 2). This pathogenic behaviour is not unexpected, as EBV is best known for its ability to infect resting B lymphocytes *in vitro*, where it uses the growth programme to efficiently drive the cells out of their resting state<sup>16</sup> to become activated proliferating lymphoblasts<sup>17,18</sup>. In doing this, the virus has no preference for the type of B cell it infects. This raises the question: how does EBV, *in vivo*, manage to establish and maintain persistent infection in resting B cells, without activating them, and show such specificity for the memory B-cell pool?

A solution to this apparently paradoxical behaviour comes from the idea that EBV uses the growth programme to activate B cells so that they can differentiate into resting memory cells. We have proposed that the virus achieves this through the expression of the default programme<sup>19–22</sup>, which could provide the necessary surrogate signals to rescue the activated B cell into memory and thereby exploit the normal pathway by which antigen-activated naive B cells enter the memory compartment<sup>21,23</sup>.

### LMP1 and LMP2 rescue signals

Three viral proteins are expressed in the default programme<sup>20,24</sup> (TABLE 1). Of these, EBV nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) ensures replication of the viral genome during cell division<sup>25</sup>. The key proteins are latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) and LMP2A (FIG. 1 and FIG. 2). Both are multiple membrane-spanning molecules that lack significant extracellular domains, and both act as constitutively active ligand-independent receptors<sup>26,27</sup>. The key point is that between them they possess the signalling capability necessary to rescue an activated B blast into the memory B-cell pool.

### Epstein-Barr virus: exploiting the immune system

**David A. Thorley-Lawson**

*In vitro*, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) will infect any resting B cell, driving it out of the resting state to become an activated proliferating lymphoblast. Paradoxically, EBV persists *in vivo* in a quiescent state in resting memory B cells that circulate in the peripheral blood. How does the virus get there, and with such specificity for the memory compartment? An explanation comes from the idea that two genes encoded by the virus — *LMP1* and *LMP2A* — allow EBV to exploit the normal pathways of B-cell differentiation so that the EBV-infected B blast can become a resting memory cell.

The human herpesvirus Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) preferentially infects B cells, but occasionally infects other cell types, especially epithelial cells. EBV-infected B cells *in vivo* can express four different programmes of gene usage depending on the location and differentiation state of the infected B cell. One of these programmes is used to produce infectious virus. The other three are all associated with latent infection, in which no infectious virus is produced, and are known as: the growth programme, in which all nine known latent proteins are expressed; the default programme, in which a restricted set of three latent proteins are expressed; and the latency programme, in which few if any latent genes are expressed (TABLE 1).

The virus uses the latency programme to persist *in vivo* in a transcriptionally quiescent state<sup>1–4</sup> within resting memory B cells<sup>5–7</sup> that circulate in the peripheral blood. In this

Normally, a proportion of B cells that encounter antigen becomes activated and migrates into the follicle of a lymph node where the cells form GERMINAL CENTRES. There, they undergo rounds of proliferation and somatic hypermutation, followed by selection for cells that have mutated their immunoglobulin genes to produce higher-affinity antibodies (FIG. 3). All other cells perish by apoptosis. Signals through the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) and from T-helper (T_H) cells are essential for survival in this competitive environment^{28–30}. We propose that the virus neatly exploits this process through the expression of LMP1 and LMP2A.

As illustrated in FIG. 1, LMP1 interacts with a set of molecules called the tumour-necrosis-factor-receptor-associated factors (TRAFs)^{31}. These molecules act as intermediaries in signalling by members of the tumour-necrosis-factor receptor (TNFR) family of cell-surface receptors^{32}. These include receptors that can deliver both survival and death signals^{33}. For our discussion, **CD40** is the most important member of this family because it is a key receptor on germinal centre B cells, which, when engaged by **CD154** on T_H cells, can deliver a survival signal^{34}. LMP1 is a functional homologue of CD40 (REFS. 35,36). This was shown experimentally by demonstrating that the signalling domains are interchangeable^{27}. The net result of signalling from both CD40 and LMP1 is to rescue B cells from apoptosis and drive their proliferation. Interestingly, LMP1 and CD40 do not interact with exactly the same sets of molecules, indicating that the signalling pathways might differ in some aspects (FIG. 1).

The signalling relationship between LMP2A and the BCR is shown in FIG. 2. Both receptors contain IMMUNORECEPTOR TYROSINE-BASED ACTIVATION MOTIFS (ITAMs)^{37} and associate with Lyn^{38,39}, a member of the Src family of tyrosine kinases. The BCR can transduce different ‘levels’ of signalling^{39,40}. Engagement by specific antigen leads to the activation of potent growth-promoting signalling cascades, including the ras pathway, in addition to those shown in FIG. 2. In the absence of antigen, the BCR delivers a non-proliferative or tonic signal that has been shown to be essential for the survival of all B cells^{41}. This is the signal that LMP2A mimics, because LMP2A does not cause B cells to grow^{38}; however, in mice, an LMP2A transgene will rescue B cells that lack surface immunoglobulin from death. This shows that LMP2A can replace the survival signal that is usually provided by an intact BCR^{26}.

Figure 1 | Signalling relationship between LMP1 and CD40. Latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) consists of cytoplasmic amino-terminal and carboxy-terminal domains linked by six transmembrane sequences with no significant extracellular domain. The carboxy-terminal domain has extensive functional homology, but no significant sequence homology, with CD40. Both LMP1 and CD40 contain consensus tumour-necrosis-factor-receptor-associated factor (TRAF)-binding domains and interact with multiple members of that family. The downstream signalling from LMP1 and CD40 causes activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB)^{64,81}. LMP1 and CD40 have also been shown to interact with Janus-activated kinase 3 (JAK3) and signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs), and to activate the activator protein 1 (AP-1) transcription complex through the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signalling pathway^{82–84}. The net result is that both LMP1 and CD40 signalling rescues B cells from apoptosis and drives their proliferation. Interestingly, LMP1 and CD40 do not interact with exactly the same sets of molecules, indicating that the signalling pathways might differ in some aspects. For example, CD40 binds TRAF6 but LMP1 does not^{85,86}. Conversely, LMP1 binds TNFR-associated death domain protein (TRADD)^{87}, which is usually associated with death signals, but not in the case of LMP1 (REF. 88). Additionally, CD40 activates NF-κB primarily through the binding of TRAF2 to its consensus TRAF-binding sequence (Pro-Xaa-Gln-Xaa-Thr; PXQXT), whereas the PXQXT domain seems to be relatively unimportant for NF-κB activation by LMP1 (REF. 86). Instead, it is the recruitment of TRAF2 by the TRADD-binding domain that is crucial for NF-κB activation^{87,88}.

How does it work?

Initial infection of B cells. EBV has diametrically opposite behaviours. On the one hand, whenever it infects a resting B lymphocyte it drives the activation and proliferation of that cell. On the other hand, the virus can reside quiescently in resting memory B cells. These two behaviours correlate with the location of the infected cells. The NASOPHARYNGEAL LYMPHOID SYSTEM, which includes the tonsils, is the place where the virus is active (FIG. 4); the peripheral circulation is where the virus is dormant.

Infectious virus can arrive at the tonsils through two routes. During acute infection, virus, from saliva exchange with another infected individual^{42}, enters the TONSILLAR CRYPTS and crosses, by an unknown mechanism, the thin layer of epithelium overlying the bed of

lymphocytes below (FIG. 4). During persistent infection, virus is continuously produced from cells that undergo lytic replication within the tonsil<sup>43</sup>. Infectious virus is produced in a specific anatomical area immediately below the epithelium, where a large concentration of naive B cells resides — the FOLLICULAR MANTLE. We know this because in the tonsils of healthy carriers only naive B cells express the growth programme that is characteristically expressed by directly infected cells<sup>21,44</sup>.

B-cell activation usually requires signals from T<sub>H</sub> cells, antigen-presenting cells and regulatory cytokines. EBV mimics this process through the coordinated expression of nine (so far known) latent proteins, which are under the direction of a master transcription factor, EBNA2 (REF. 45). This is known, because infection of highly purified resting B cells in culture invariably results in proliferating-activated lymphoblasts. Much remains to be learned about how EBV does this. A summary of the key functions so far identified and the latent proteins responsible are detailed in BOX 3.

In summary, proliferating naive B-cell blasts that are latently infected with EBV and resemble antigen-activated blasts are continuously being produced in the tonsils. We have proposed that these cells are not ordinarily a pathogenic threat because they do not continue to proliferate; instead, they differentiate out of cell cycle into a resting state by following the path of B-cell differentiation into memory.

**Rescue of activated B cells.** Activation of naive B cells by antigen or infection with EBV results in the full activated lymphoblastoid phenotype. Antigen-activated B cells migrate into the follicles<sup>46</sup>, where they proliferate,

Figure 2 | **Signalling relationship between LMP2A and the BCR.** Latent membrane protein 2A (LMP2A) consists of cytoplasmic amino-terminal and carboxy-terminal domains linked by 12 transmembrane sequences with no significant extracellular domain. The amino-terminal domain of LMP2A contains the same immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs)<sup>37</sup> found in the α- and β-chains of the B-cell receptor (BCR). Both LMP2A and the BCR associate with Lyn<sup>38,39</sup>, a member of the Src family of tyrosine kinases. Phosphorylation of tyrosine residues within the ITAM by Lyn leads to recruitment of the Syk tyrosine kinase and the canonical downstream BCR signalling events shown here, including entry into LIPID RAFTS<sup>39,89</sup> (shown in red). LMP2A signalling does not cause B cells to grow<sup>38</sup>, but delivers the tonic signal that is essential for the survival of all B cells<sup>26,41</sup>.

forming germinal centres that generate antibody-producing plasma cells and memory cells<sup>28–30</sup>. Similarly, the EBV-infected B-cell blasts might enter follicles, where they undergo germinal-centre differentiation and become memory cells.

Sometime during this process, the viral transcription programme changes. We know this because analysis of viral-gene transcription in cells with a germinal-centre phenotype

Box 1 | **X-linked lymphoproliferative disease**

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection is ultimately benign in virtually all infected individuals. However, 75% of males carrying mutations in the X-linked lymphoproliferative disease (XLP) gene will die within 1 month of primary EBV infection. Prior to EBV infection, these individuals are not obviously immunocompromised. They are able to handle a wide range of infections, including other herpesviruses, but succumb to primary EBV infection due to massive invasion of liver and bone marrow by CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, macrophages and EBV-infected B cells expressing the growth programme<sup>67</sup>, resulting in hepatitis and hypoplasia. Surviving boys typically have severely disrupted immune systems, resulting in varying degrees of hypogammaglobulinaemia.

Occasionally, XLP has appeared in boys without detectable EBV infection, implying that EBV precipitates an incipient predisposition. What this predisposition might be and how it might be caused by mutations in the XLP gene are not known. The XLP gene encodes a small signalling protein, SAP (signalling lymphocyte activation molecule-associated protein), which contains a single Src homology 2 (SH2) domain and is involved in negative regulation of T- and B-cell signalling<sup>12,13</sup>. The mechanism of its association with EBV infection is obscure, but a mutation in the wild-type XLP gene allows primary EBV infection to become a rapidly fatal disease<sup>15,67</sup>. It has been suggested that the mutations lead to a failure or impairment of immunological surveillance by T cells<sup>12,13</sup>. We suggest that the failure might actually be in the ability to efficiently signal EBV-infected lymphoblasts to enter into the memory compartment.

shows that only the default programme is expressed<sup>21</sup>. How this change occurs is not known, but it probably involves signals originating in the follicles. The transition requires that EBNA2 is turned off because EBNA2 expression blocks differentiation<sup>47</sup>. It is likely that this block is achieved through the NOTCH signalling pathway (BOX 3)<sup>43,48</sup>.

We suggest that turning off EBNA2 allows a blast to adopt a germinal centre B-cell phenotype<sup>47</sup> and to switch to the default programme. So, the virus provides the B lymphocyte with the necessary signals that allow the latently infected cells to survive activation and emerge into the memory compartment.

This model does not require that every EBV-infected naive B cell gives rise to a full germinal centre. It is possible that the EBV blasts occupy a small part of an antigen-driven germinal centre or undergo very limited expansion as germinal centre cells, or even undergo extrafollicular expansion and differentiation. The later possibility is indicated by recent studies with LMP1 transgenic mice<sup>49</sup> and by immunohistochemical studies that fail to find significant numbers of EBV-infected cells in germinal centres. Negative results with histochemical approaches should be interpreted with caution, however, as the lower level of sensitivity of the tests is never defined<sup>50</sup>.

PERSPECTIVES

Persistence in the memory pool. The expected conclusion of this process is that the latently infected cells will turn off all latent gene expression<sup>4</sup> and exit the tonsil into the peripheral circulation as resting memory cells, where the virus can persist for the life of the host. Because the growth-promoting latent genes are not expressed<sup>1–3</sup> the cells are non-pathogenic and in this way the virus can persist in the benign state. As the main CTL targets are also not expressed<sup>1–3</sup>, the virus is also hidden from the immune response and cannot be eliminated.

Long-term B-cell memory requires survival signals provided through the expression of a functional BCR, although specific antigen itself is not required<sup>40</sup>. As already discussed, LMP2A is capable of providing this tonic signal. Memory B cells latently infected with EBV in the tonsil, unlike the periphery, express the default programme<sup>22</sup>. We speculate that the resting recirculating memory B cells pass back through the tonsils where local signals, as yet unknown, allow re-expression of LMP1 and LMP2A. LMP2A could, therefore, deliver the necessary BCR signal to ensure survival of the cells in the memory compartment. Expression of LMP1 might imply that some form of T-cell help is also required to maintain long-lived memory (see below).

The latently infected memory cell is not a dead end for the virus, because it can replicate in these cells (L. Laichalk and D.A.T.-L., unpublished observations) and release infectious virus into saliva for new infection of naive B cells. Viral replication might be associated with terminal differentiation of the memory cells into plasma cells<sup>6,51</sup>. The signals and timing involved in inducing reactivation are unknown.

In summary, we propose that EBV persistence can be thought of as a dynamic equilibrium between the immune response and the various states of infection. The essence of this equilibrium is summarized in FIG. 5. The numbers of virus-infected cells are increased by new infection and by expansion of cells expressing the growth and default programmes. This is counterbalanced by viral neutralizing antibodies and by cell death caused by the production of infectious virus or by CTLs directed against cells expressing latent or lytic proteins. The key to the stability of the network is the pool of latently infected cells in the periphery, which act as a stable buffer because they are neither under immunosurveillance nor do they proliferate.

### So what goes wrong?

Consideration of the model by which EBV gains access to and then persists in the memory compartment, as detailed above, indicates that the virus has developed a potentially pathogenic mechanism — activation and growth of naive B cells — to gain access to this compartment. The model indicates, however,

**Box 2 | EBV-associated diseases**

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) drives the proliferation of infected B cells by expressing a small number of growth-promoting latency genes (see BOX 3). This is the risk factor which, in combination with environmental and genetic cofactors, links EBV infection to several important neoplastic diseases. Combinations of environmental and genetic factors contribute to EBV-associated diseases, which include:

- **Infectious mononucleosis**
  A self-limiting lymphoproliferative disease that might arise if infection occurs in adolescence or later. At the height of the disease up to 50% of the T cells can be specific for the virus<sup>68</sup> and up to 25% of the memory B cells are latently infected (D. Hochberg *et al.*, unpublished observations).

- **Burkitt’s lymphoma (BL)**
  The tumour in which the virus was first discovered<sup>69</sup>. The defining feature of BL is translocation of the *c-myc* proto-oncogene into one of the immunoglobulin loci leading to deregulated myc expression<sup>70,71</sup>. EBV is present in most, but not all, BL, where it only expresses EBV nuclear antigen 1 (REF. 72), but the role of the virus in pathogenesis is unclear.

- **Nasopharyngeal carcinoma**
  Extremely common tumour in certain high-risk groups such as the Southern Chinese and Eskimos<sup>73</sup>. The undifferentiated form of nasopharyngeal carcinoma is always EBV-positive<sup>74</sup>. Other cofactors must be involved, and both environmental (for example, salted, pickled fish<sup>75</sup>) and genetic susceptibilities have been implicated<sup>76</sup>.

- **Hodgkin’s Disease (HD)**
  Infectious mononucleosis (IM) is a predisposing factor for the development of HD and the only time when the peculiar cells of HD (the Reed–Sternberg cells) are consistently observed outside of HD is during IM<sup>51</sup>. However, EBV is only present in 40–60% of cases<sup>77</sup>, and IM is predisposing for both EBV-positive and EBV-negative HD. This indicates that the disruption of IM, rather than EBV *per se*, might be the predisposing factor.

- **Immunoblastic lymphomas**
  A heterogeneous group of B-cell tumours, expressing the growth programme, that arise in individuals who are immunocompromised and unable to mount an effective cytotoxic T-lymphocyte response to these cells. Immunosuppression can arise iatrogenically (organ transplants), environmentally (human immunodeficiency virus infection) or genetically (X-linked lymphoproliferative disease)<sup>55,56</sup>.

Figure 3 | The parallels between an antigen-driven B-cell response and EBV infection. When a resting naive B cell in the follicle of a lymph node interacts with cognate antigen, it becomes activated and begins to proliferate as a B-cell blast. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection of B cells causes them to become proliferating B blasts due to expression of the viral growth transcription programme. The antigen-activated B blast then enters the follicles, where it expands to form a germinal centre (GC). Within the germinal centre, the survival of the cell depends on its ability to receive signals from antigen, carried on FOLLICULAR DENDRITIC CELLS, and antigen-specific T-helper (*T<sub>H</sub>*) cells. We suggest that these signals are mimicked through expression of the viral default transcription programme which can replace the *T<sub>H</sub>* and antigen signals. Finally, the cells leave the follicle as resting memory B cells that enter the peripheral circulation. We propose that the EBV-infected cells enter the memory pool by shutting down expression of all of the viral latent proteins — the latency transcription programme.

that the pathogenic potential is normally ameliorated for the very reason it is used, because the infected cells can differentiate out of the proliferative state and into memory. It follows, therefore, that the virus should only constitute a pathogenic threat when something goes wrong.

In the tonsils of patients with infectious mononucleosis (IM), the virus wreaks havoc by infecting different cell types directly. This includes memory cells expressing the growth programme<sup>52</sup>, an event never observed in healthy carriers<sup>44</sup>. These cells undergo clonal expansion, and we have suggested that this occurs because, unlike directly infected naive B cells, the memory cells are unable to differentiate out of the cell cycle. Presumably, these memory cells continue to expand until CTLs arise to destroy them. Nevertheless, the basic regulatory process seems to hold, as only resting latently infected memory cells make it into the peripheral circulation. The level of these cells can reach a staggering 25% of the B-cell memory compartment (D. Hochberg *et al.*, unpublished observations), indicating that EBV could indeed take over the entire memory pool if left unchecked by the immune response (FIG. 5). The nature of the immunological state that leads to IM is unclear, although it is known that the risk for developing severe disease during acute EBV infection increases with age. The reason for this is unclear, but an explanation might be found in the concept of heterologous immunity<sup>53</sup>; that is, infection when young elicits powerful naive CTL responses that rapidly contain and control the infection. However, with age, the T-cell memory compartment becomes filled due to exposure to many pathogens, so that infection at a later age with EBV, for example, is more likely to elicit a weak crossreactive ‘heterologous’ CTL response that clears the virus inefficiently. To eliminate infection, these crossreactive T cells must be activated more extensively, resulting in a massive inflammatory response that generates the disease symptoms of IM.

The failure of infected cells to differentiate into the memory compartment will result in stable expression of growth-promoting genes and a concomitant risk of tumour development. This can take two forms. First, inappropriate infection. If a B cell becomes infected with EBV at the wrong stage of development or at the wrong location, it will express the growth programme and proliferate, but will not be able to differentiate out of the cell cycle. Normally, this cell would be destroyed by the cellular immune system<sup>54</sup>. In immunosuppressed individuals, or during acute infection, however, such cells would be free to

EBV-infected memory cells express the default programme which might provide the necessary signals for long-term survival of the cells as memory cells. They then turn off the default programme, and leave by the efferent lymphatics. **h** | Occasionally, a fraction of latently infected memory cells initiates replication of the virus to be shed into saliva. Failure to activate the default programme before LMP1 and LMP2A protein are lost might be the trigger.

grow out of control — hence EBV-associated tumours in the immunosuppressed usually express the growth programme<sup>55,56</sup>, and will often regress if immunosuppression is relieved or if the patients are infused with autologous EBV-specific CTLs<sup>57</sup>.

Alternatively, constitutive expression of LMP1, which is known to be oncogenic in experimental systems<sup>58</sup>, could occur in cells expressing the default programme. We have coined the term ‘default programme’ to describe the limited expression of EBNA1, LMP1 and LMP2A, because this seems to be the ‘automatic’ default transcription programme that the virus uses when inside a proliferating cell. EBV probably evolved this programme because the virus resides in B cells, which are notoriously prone to apoptosis when they become activated. So, as soon as the B cell starts to proliferate, the virus can turn on a transcription programme that guarantees persistence of the virus through EBNA1, and the survival of the B cell through LMP1 and LMP2A. A cell could be caused to express the default programme constitutively, either through cellular mutation in B cells or by infecting the wrong tissue. An example of the former might be Hodgkin’s disease, in which mutations lead to activation of the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) system and differentiation arrest of the B cells at the germinal centre stage<sup>59</sup>. If this occurred in an EBV-infected cell it would cause the default programme, including LMP1, to be constitutively expressed<sup>60–63</sup>. LMP1 is itself known to activate NF-κB<sup>64</sup>. An example of inappropriate infection might be nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), in which the virus has entered

Figure 5 | The positive and negative systems that maintain EBV in a stable persistent state. Recirculating memory cells, expressing the latency programme, enter the tonsil where they undergo one of two fates. They either re-express the default programme to ensure long-term survival and then leave again to re-enter the pool of recirculating memory cells, or they initiate lytic replication (D. A. T.-L et al., unpublished observations) and produce infectious virus. This virus infects new naive B cells, which expand under the growth programme, and then differentiate using the default programme into resting memory cells that enter the pool of recirculating cells. This circuitry alone seems to contain steps that would all lead to an increase in the number of infected memory cells; however, each step is counterbalanced by a negative regulator. Infectious virus is destroyed by neutralizing antibody and all infected states — both lytic and latent — are the targets of cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL)<sup>54</sup>, with the exception of the pool of recirculating memory cells. The negative regulation on recirculating memory cells is that these cells sporadically enter the lytic cycle to produce infectious virus and die.

and signalling of B lymphocytes was used to study how EBV persists. However, some observations made along the way provide food for thought for immunologists.

**A marker for tonsillar memory B cells.** It is not known at present to what extent tonsillar memory B cells recirculate. However, EBV establishes persistent infection in tonsillar memory B cells, and their presence in the peripheral blood indicates that they might recirculate. We have even found EBV-infected cells in spleen and peripheral lymph nodes, although at a level 10–20-fold lower than the tonsil (L. Laichalk, R. Freiman and D. A. T.-L., unpublished observations) — indicating that tonsillar memory cells might ‘visit’ non-mucosal sites, albeit at a much lower rate than the tonsils. This would make sense because it would allow the immune system to survey other locations, although still focusing its main effort on the original site where the memory cells arose (the tonsil in this case).

a proliferating non-B cell (undifferentiated epithelium) and turned on the default programme<sup>20,24</sup>. LMP1 expression cannot then be turned off because epithelial cells cannot differentiate into resting memory cells. Expression of the default programme is characteristic of tumours that arise in the immunocompetent individual.

### Glossary

- **FOLLICULAR DENDRITIC CELL**  
  Specialized non-haematopoietic stromal cells that reside in the follicles and germinal centres. These cells possess long dendrites, but are not related to dendritic cells, and carry intact antigen on their surface.

- **FOLLICULAR MANTLE**  
  A structure formed when the naive B cells that occupy the follicle are pushed aside by an expanding germinal centre. The displaced naive B cells therefore form a ‘mantle’ around the germinal centre.

- **GERMINAL CENTRES**  
  The structure that is formed by the expansion of antigen-activated B-cell blasts that have migrated into the follicles of lymph nodes. The B cells in these structures proliferate and the immunoglobulin genes undergo somatic hypermutation, before the cells leave as plasma cells or memory cells.

- **IMMUNORECEPTOR TYROSINE-BASED ACTIVATION MOTIF (ITAM)**  
  A structural motif containing tyrosine residues, found in the cytoplasmic tails of several signalling molecules. The motif has the form Tyr-Xaa-Xaa-Leu/Ile, and the tyrosine is a target for phosphorylation by Src tyrosine kinases and subsequent binding of proteins containing SH2 domains.

- **LIPID RAFTS**  
  Cholesterol-rich regions that provide ordered structure to the lipid bilayer and have the ability to include or exclude specific signalling molecules and complexes.

- **NASOPHARYNGEAL LYMPHOID SYSTEM**  
  This is an expanded region of lymphoid tissue that surrounds the nasopharynx and includes the tonsil and adenoids. It serves to monitor antigens arriving through the mouth and nose and is known collectively as Waldeyer’s ring.

- **NOTCH**  
  A signalling system comprising highly conserved transmembrane receptors that regulate cell fate choice in the development of many cell lineages, and so are vital in the regulation of embryonic differentiation and development.

- **SOMATIC HYPERMUTATION**  
  The process by which antigen-activated B cells in germinal centres mutate their rearranged immunoglobulin genes. The B cells are subsequently selected for those expressing the ‘best’ mutations on the basis of the ability of the surface immunoglobulin to bind antigen.

- **TONSILLAR CRYPTS**  
  Invaginations of the epithelium that surround the tonsils. Unlike the skin, which acts as a barrier, the tonsillar epithelium is sponge-like to provide the maximum surface area for sampling antigen.

Different types of memory B cells. Memory cells in the blood are defined by the presence of mutations in the hypervariable regions of the immunoglobulin genes and the expression of CD27 (REF.65). They can express any of the immunoglobulin isotypes (IgD, IgM, IgG, IgA or IgE). EBV-infected cells are evenly distributed among all of the memory types, with the exception of those bearing IgD<sup>5</sup>. This indicates a unique biology for the IgD-bearing memory cell, as it is incapable of either establishing or maintaining persistent EBV infection.

**T-cell help for long-term memory.** There is now convincing experimental data that memory B cells can persist in the absence of antigen and, by default, antigen-specific T<sub>H</sub> cells, at least in the mouse spleen<sup>40</sup>. All that is needed is an intact BCR. EBV-infected memory cells in the tonsil express LMP1 and LMP2A<sup>22</sup>. As discussed above, LMP2A can replace the intact BCR signal, but why is LMP1 needed if T-cell help is not? Perhaps the EBV system is providing a clue that CD40/TNFR signals are required for long-term memory after all? This could mean that antigen-specific T<sub>H</sub> cells are required if long-lived B-cell memory in humans is to persist for decades (unlike mice, which only live for 1–2 years). Instead, this might be an indication that T<sub>H</sub> signals are required for mucosal memory (as opposed to splenic memory). Alternatively, it might be that CD40/TNFR signals are required, but they do not have to arise from antigen-specific T<sub>H</sub> cells.

Box 3 | Latent proteins and their functions

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) encodes nine latency-associated proteins. Six of these are localized in the nucleus (EBV nuclear antigens; EBNA) and three in the membrane (latent membrane proteins; LMPs). The proteins for which well-defined functions are known are:

- EBNA1, which links the viral genome, a covalently closed episome, to the cellular chromosome so that the virus is replicated in dividing cells as though it were part of the cellular genome<sup>25</sup>.
- EBNA2, which is the mastermind behind EBV-driven growth, takes control of the transcriptional machinery required to block B-cell differentiation at the proliferative stage<sup>45</sup>. It is thought to achieve this by binding to RBPJκ/CBP, thereby acting as a surrogate for the Notch intracellular domain (IC) in the Notch signalling system<sup>48</sup>. It turns on all the other viral latent genes in the growth programme and a range of cellular-activation-associated genes including *c-myc*<sup>79</sup>, the mitogenic proto-oncogene.
- EBNA3C, which allows the activated cells to progress through the G1/S boundary of the cell cycle, acts similarly to papillomavirus E7 in inactivating the function of the retinoblastoma tumour suppressor (Rb); however, the mechanism is not well understood<sup>80</sup>.
- LMP1, which is a ligand-independent cell-surface signalling molecule, provides a surrogate T-helper cell signal. It interacts with the signalling system of the tumour-necrosis-factor receptor (TNFR) family, including TNFR-associated factors (TRAFs), TNFR-associated death domain protein (TRADD) and Janus-activated kinase 3 (JAK3), to activate the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) pathways in order to provide both survival and growth signals (see FIG. 1).
- LMP2A, which is also a ligand-independent cell-surface signalling molecule, interacts with members of the Src family of tyrosine kinases through possession of the same immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) found in the α- and β-chains of the B-cell receptor (BCR). The signal produced does not lead to activation and growth of the B cell, but closely resembles the more ‘moderate’ signal provided by the intact BCR that is required for positive selection of B cells in the bone marrow and for survival of mature B cells in the periphery, in the absence of cognate antigen (see FIG. 2).

Notch and B-cell differentiation. There is no clear evidence that the Notch signalling pathway is involved in regulating B-cell activation and differentiation. In muscle development, it is known that the interaction of the Notch intracellular domain (IC) with the DNA-binding protein RBPJκ/CBP1 leads to a block in differentiation<sup>66</sup>. The consequence is that differentiation is blocked and the cells continue to proliferate. EBNA2 also binds to RBPJκ/CBP1 (REF. 45) and exerts a similar effect; that is, EBNA2 promotes growth at the expense of differentiation. Indeed, Notch1 IC can partially replace EBNA2 function in the virus<sup>43</sup>. It is tempting to speculate, therefore, that EBNA2 has co-opted a normal B-cell signalling pathway, involving Notch, that regulates the transition from B-cell blast to germinal centre cell.

### Conclusions

The combination of *in vitro* investigation of the molecular mechanism of latent gene function and *in vivo* studies of the relationship between latent gene expression patterns and B-cell differentiation stage has led to an exciting synthesis. We are beginning to understand in ways never before imagined how this human pathogen works. In the future, we will be looking to understand the

signalling processes that regulate the transitions between the different states of infection, the biological consequences of signalling by the latent proteins to the normal B cells and the mistakes that occur leading to oncogenesis. The central question that remains to be answered is: does specific antigen have any role in the process or do the viral latent proteins (LMP1 and LMP2A) do the whole job from start to finish? In other words, are the EBV-infected cells bona fide antigen-specific or ‘fake’ memory cells?
