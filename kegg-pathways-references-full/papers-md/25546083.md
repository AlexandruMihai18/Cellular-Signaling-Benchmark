### SUMMARY

Recent years have led to a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying cisplatin response and resistance in germ cell tumours (GCT), and several promising targets have been identified. Two main mechanisms of the responsiveness to DNA damaging agents have been postulated. Firstly, GCT readily activate a DNA damage response, but show deficits in several damage repair pathways. In particular, they have been found to have defects in interstrand crosslink repair and in homologous recombination (HR). Secondly, GCT, especially embryonal carcinoma (EC) cells, show a hypersensitive apoptotic response to DNA damage, which activates p53, and leads to up-regulation of the pro-apoptotic factors Noxa, Puma and Fas in non-resistant EC. These cells fail to activate p21 which induces a G1/S arrest, but accumulate in G2/M phase. In the absence of functional p53, family members like p73 and GAp63 might be important in initiating this response. Mechanisms involved in cisplatin resistance are as follows: down-regulation of Oct4 (e.g. as a result of hypoxia, treatment with retinoic acid or exposure to cisplatin) and failure to induce Puma and Noxa; changes in the expression levels of micro-RNAs such as miR-17/-106b, miR-302a, or miR-371 to -373; elevated levels of MDM2 and cytoplasmic translocation of p21 by phosphorylation; and activation of the PDGFRβ/PI3K/pAKT pathway. Several approaches to overcome resistance have been successfully examined in vitro and in vivo, including PARP inhibitors, especially in cells showing deficient HR-repair; stabilization of p53 using nutlin-3; inhibition of several components of the PI3K/pAKT pathway using small molecules; and DNA demethylation by 5-azacytidine or 5-aza-deoxy-cytidine, among others. Many of these substances deserve further exploration, alone or in combination with DNA damaging agents, and the most promising approaches should be taken forward to clinical testing. Targeted therapy based on mechanistic insights holds the promise to turn cisplatin-resistant GCT into a curable disease.

### CISPLATIN RESISTANCE: THE CLINICAL DIMENSION

As the most common tumour in adolescents and young men, germ cell tumours (GCT) show a rising incidence in many countries of the Western world. A prognostic classification for patients with metastatic GCT at first diagnosis was introduced in 1997 and is still used today to classify patients according to clinical parameters into three groups – good, intermediate and poor prognosis (Mead & Stenning, 1997). First-line treatment is risk-adapted and well standardized according to international guidelines and clinical recommendations (Krege et al., 2008; Beyer et al., 2013). Despite unparalleled success in terms of cure rates achieved by the use of combination chemotherapy including cisplatin, an overall small, but clinically meaningful number of patients will relapse following adequate treatment. Based on the results of a retrospective chart review of initial salvage treatment in 1,594 patients, the International Prognostic Factors Study Group introduced a prognostic model for patients with relapsed GCT a few years ago (Lorch et al., 2010). Based on seven clinical parameters, five prognostic subgroups with significantly different progression-free and overall survival were identified. A smaller German series of patients with relapsed GCT recently confirmed the prognostic value of these factors in an independent cohort (Berger et al., 2014).

Treatment of patients with cisplatin-resistant or -refractory disease has been reviewed previously (Kollmannsberger et al., 2008; Koychev et al., 2011). In summary, treatment is less well defined in the salvage situation than in the first-line setting, and both conventional- and high-dose chemotherapy regimens have been assessed. Several conventional-dose chemotherapy regimens have been developed that combine cisplatin with ifosfamide and either etoposide, vinblastine, paclitaxel or more recently gemcitabine (Loehrer et al., 1986, 1998; Motzer et al.,

2000; Fizazi *et al.*, 2014). As no randomized controlled trials allowing a comparison of efficacy and toxicity of these regimens are available, no ‘gold standard’ of conventional-dose chemotherapy as first salvage therapy has been defined. Overall, long-term remissions are seen in 40–50% of patients, which is substantially inferior to remission rates achievable in the first-line situation. Whether the majority of these cases are as a result of intrinsic or acquired drug resistance remains elusive at this point.

In attempts to improve outcome, a number of trials using high-dose chemotherapy has been performed in the last decades (for review, see Koychev *et al.*, 2011). Data from the database of the International Prognostic Factors Study Group suggest that there could be a 20% difference in the 2 years progression-free survival rate, translating into a significantly improved overall survival after 3 years (55% vs. 46%; *p* < 0.001; Lorch *et al.*, 2011). Biologically, this could indicate that in some tumours, only partial resistance against platinum compounds exists, which can be overcome by higher doses of the drugs. However, because of their retrospective nature, the data should be interpreted with some caution. In clinical trials, it could be established that sequential high-dose chemotherapy with two to three cycles using carboplatin and etoposide followed by stem cell rescue should be preferred over protocols using several cycles of conventional-dose therapy, followed by a three drug combination within a single cycle of dose-escalated therapy because of reduced toxicity, especially less early toxic deaths, and at least equal efficacy of these two approaches (Lorch *et al.*, 2007). Retrospective data from the above mentioned database from the International Prognostic Factors Study Group indicate in addition that there might be a small, but potentially meaningful benefit of sequential high-dose therapy regarding both progression-free and overall survival (Lorch *et al.*, 2011). The only randomized trial comparing conventional-dose and high-dose chemotherapy in the salvage setting could not demonstrate increased survival rates following high-dose chemotherapy (Pico *et al.*, 2005). The caveats that have to be considered when interpreting this trial are discussed elsewhere (Koychev *et al.*, 2011).

After 4 years of intense efforts to secure support for the trial, an international, randomized controlled phase III trial comparing conventional and high-dose chemotherapy at first relapse after cisplatin-based chemotherapy for advanced disease is finally under way to assess the role of what are currently believed to be the most effective relapse regimens of both high-dose and conventional-dose chemotherapy in a prospective way.

The majority of relapses are observed during or within two years after completion of first systemic treatment. Relapses occurring after that time period occur in 1–3% of all patients treated for advanced disease (Kuczyk *et al.*, 2004; Lipphardt & Albers, 2004; Geldart *et al.*, 2006). These so-called ‘late relapses’ show a particularly high rate of chemotherapy resistance, possibly because of distinct biological features (Mayer *et al.*, 2011) and should be treated with complete surgical resection whenever possible (Krege *et al.*, 2008; Beyer *et al.*, 2013).

‘OLD’ AND ‘NEW’ DRUGS IN CISPLATIN-RESISTANT DISEASE: CLINICAL TRIALS AND CASE REPORTS

After failure of two or more lines of adequately dosed combination chemotherapy, long-term survival can be achieved in only a fraction of patients. Over the past four decades, a number

of single agents have been evaluated in this situation, often without a rationale based upon data from preclinical testing. For the purpose of this review, substances tested in relapsed or refractory GCT shall be divided into ‘old’ drugs, meaning classical cytotoxic agents, and ‘new’ drugs, which comprise small molecules that either target specific pathways (targeted therapy) or otherwise induce molecular alterations, such as differentiation, and/or epigenetic alterations. Curiously, ‘new’ substances like 5-azacytidine have been tested in GCT almost 40 years ago (Quagliana *et al.*, 1977), whereas even nowadays, the time of testing ‘old’ cytotoxic substances like cabazitaxel in this disease are not over yet (Jan Oldenburg, personal communication). This highlights the fact that such a division is somewhat arbitrary and does not truly reflect chronology of drug development.

Many ‘old’ agents have been tested in clinical trials; however, only four substances have proven to have noteworthy clinical activity in relapsed or refractory disease. These are low-dose oral etoposide as a continuous treatment, paclitaxel, gemcitabine and most recently oxaliplatin, all yielding response rates of about 20% (for review, see Kollmannsberger *et al.*, 2008). At present, the last three drugs are often used in various two- to three-drug combinations (Hinton *et al.*, 2002; Kollmannsberger *et al.*, 2004; Pectasides *et al.*, 2004; Einhorn *et al.*, 2007; Boke-meyer *et al.*, 2008). The response rate ranges from 23 to 46% with two-drug regimens, and can reach 51% with a three-drug combination. However, responses are often short-lived, and long-term survival is as poor as 5–10% combining two, and 15% combining three drugs (Oechsle *et al.*, 2011a).

Unlike in many other solid tumours including breast, colorectal or lung cancer, no clinically relevant predictive or prognostic markers or ‘drugable’ targets like overexpression of growth factors or gene mutations/amplifications have so far been identified. This has hampered the development of targeted therapies as treatment options for patients with multiply relapsed and refractory GCT. However, over the years, a number of trials using ‘new’ agents have been performed, none with great success so far. Almost 40 years ago, 2 out of 4 patients with refractory testicular cancer enrolled in a phase II trial of 5-azacytidine achieved a partial remission (Quagliana *et al.*, 1977). This stirred interest in the substance in GCT and led to a small phase II trial of 5-azacytidine in patients with cisplatin-resistant disease. However, no further activity signal was observed in this series of heavily pretreated patients (Roth *et al.*, 1993). Likewise, 5-aza-deoxycytidine, another demethylating agent, did not yield a single response in 14 GCT patients treated in another phase II trial (Clavel *et al.*, 1992). However, better understanding of the action of these substances on a molecular level in GCT cells has renewed interest in those drugs that are clinically well established (Beyrouthy *et al.*, 2009; Wermann *et al.*, 2010; Biswal *et al.*, 2012). Retinoic acids like all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) increase resistance to cisplatin, suppress growth by induction of differentiation and lead to activation of a distinct protein profile in GCT cells in vitro (Timmer-Bosscha *et al.*, 1998; Gutekunst *et al.*, 2011; Honecker *et al.*, 2014). These findings help to explain results of an early trial of ATRA, which could not demonstrate any activity in a phase II trial enrolling 16 patients with relapsed GCT (Moasser *et al.*, 1995). Another substance that induces differentiation, which is successfully used in certain myeloid leukaemias, is arsenic trioxide (Douer & Tallman, 2005). A clinical phase II trial failed to demonstrate activity in patients

with GCT (Beer *et al.*, 2006). Intriguingly, a short-lived response in a heavily pretreated patient with a relapsed extragonadal GCT was documented in a Swedish case report (Kälkner *et al.*, 2007). The molecular effects underlying both this response and more frequently the observed resistance against this substance in GCT remain elusive so far. Thalidomide is a substance inducing various effects, including immunomodulatory and antiangiogenic effects via blockade of VEGF. After second-line treatment, thalidomide induced a serological response in 5 of 15 patients with relapsed GCT and induced a short lasting stabilization in one patient (Rick *et al.*, 2006). Again, the mode of action of the drug in GCT and potential means to enhance effectiveness are ill-defined at the moment. Multiple tyrosine kinases were found to be overexpressed in GCT (Müller-Tidow *et al.*, 2004), and experiments targeting the VEGF receptors both in vitro an in vivo showed promising effects of tyrosine kinase inhibitors both in cisplatin-sensitive and -resistant GCT (Castillo-Avila *et al.*, 2009; Nitzsche *et al.*, 2012). Clinically, sunitinib was the first targeted substance ever to be tested in cisplatin-resistant GCT in three independent phase II trials in Europe and the US simultaneously. However, results were rather disappointing, with only three partial remissions occurring in over 50 patients, and a few more reaching short lasting disease stabilization as the best result (Feldman *et al.*, 2010; Oechsle *et al.*, 2011b; Reckova *et al.*, 2012). Interestingly, of 4 patients showing a response, two had a relapsed seminoma (Oechsle *et al.*, 2011b). Whether these seminomas were biologically characterized by distinct molecular features such as a c-KIT mutation, has not been assessed, making patient selection to maximize benefit difficult. In this context, it is interesting that a case report documented a complete remission of a relapsed seminoma upon treatment with imatinib, a substance inhibiting, among others, c-KIT; however, another small series of six patients with relapsed GCT did not demonstrate any activity of the substance (Einhorn *et al.*, 2006; Pederini *et al.*, 2007). With the surge of new targeted agents, a large number of trials have been initiated in refractory and relapsed GCT, including bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy, the mTOR inhibitor everolimus, brentuximab vedotin (a drug–antibody conjugate targeting CD30, which is expressed on embryonal carcinoma (EC) cells), the tyrosine kinase inhibitor pazopanib, the cell cycle inhibitor flavopiridol (in combination with chemotherapy) and erlotinib in combination with the mTOR inhibitor sirolimus, among others. Some of these studies, like the German trial evaluating everolimus, have already completed accrual, and results are awaited in the near future. For more details regarding these trials, see www.clinicaltrials.gov.

In conclusion, targeted therapy has up to now not proven to significantly improve the outcome of patients with relapsed or cisplatin -refractory GCT, partly because of the lack of a good model of the mechanisms underlying both responsiveness and resistance to cisplatin.

efforts (see http://provocativequestions.nci.nih.gov). The current model mentions two critical elements underlying responsiveness: ‘A hypersensitive apoptotic response, as well as a reduction in the proficiency to repair cisplatin-induced DNA damage might account for this behaviour’ has been stated by Cavallo *et al.* (2013) in a very recent review article.

HYPERSENSITIVE APOPTOTIC RESPONSE

Unlike other solid tumours in adults originating from more differentiated tissues, GCT show a low level of constitutively activated DNA damage response (DDR). It has been postulated that this might lead to a low selective pressure on mutation rates in the DDR machinery (i.e. low rates of mutations in p53, pRb or other checkpoint inhibitors like Chk2 or ATM), securing a system that can readily be activated upon DNA damage (Bartkova *et al.*, 2007). The molecular response of GCT to DNA damage induced by cisplatin or irradiation in GCT could be a preserved pattern pertinent to embryonic cells, as both EC and human embryonic stem cells fail to activate p21, have no active G1/S checkpoint, but accumulate in the G2/M phases of the cell cycle, activate survivin and readily induce an apoptotic response via caspases (Filion *et al.*, 2009). The result is a hypersensitive apoptotic response of GCT cells, especially in EC, which are characterized by functional p53, low levels of the p53 antagonist MDM2 and high levels of the pluripotency factor Oct4 as prerequisites for activation of the pro-apoptotic proteins Noxa and Puma, which both belong to the Bcl-2 family of proteins (Gutekunst *et al.*, 2011, 2013; for review, see Koster *et al.*, 2013).

It has been shown that at least in EC, the hypersensitive response is dependent on high levels of Oct4, as well as Noxa and Puma, which are both up-regulated upon cisplatin exposure. Both Noxa and Puma play a role in the induction of apoptosis, as could be demonstrated by a significant reduction in the number of apoptotic cells upon knock-down of these factors (Gutekunst *et al.*, 2013). Another recent finding describes a role of the micro-RNA miR-302a (Liu *et al.*, 2013). This miRNA is co-transcribed with Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog in a polycistronic manner. It is not only overexpressed in in GCT, but its expression increases upon treatment of GCT cells with cisplatin (Palmer *et al.*, 2010; Liu *et al.*, 2013). As a consequence of a constitutively low p21 expression and miR-302a induction by cisplatin, cells go into a G2/M phase arrest of the cell cycle and die by apoptosis, likely as a consequence of their inability to repair the inflicted damage. Interestingly, this effect was also observed in the cell line NCCIT, which is known to have a mutant p53 (Burger *et al.*, 1997), indicating that regulation of miR-302a can occur independently of p53. Indeed, recent research suggests that two family members of p53, namely p63 and p73, might play a role in GCT cells. Beyer *et al.* have identified a p63 isoform which is uniquely expressed in the testis of humans and great apes, and which they termed germ cell-encoded transcriptionally active p63, or short GTAp63 (Beyer *et al.*, 2011). Interestingly, this isoform was found to be uniformly expressed in CIS cells, but loss of expression was observed in 70–100% of all invasive tumour cells, which lead to the speculation that this protein might act as a tumour suppressor in germ cells. Loss of expression was not the result of loss of genetic material, but was because of epigenetic regulation, as treatment of cells with histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors was sufficient to restore GTAp63 expression. GTAp63 induced

RESPONSIVENESS TO CISPLATIN

The molecular mechanisms underlying the exceptional responsiveness of GCT to platinum compounds have remained unresolved despite many years of translational and basic research, but are slowly beginning to emerge. In fact, the NCI has listed the question ‘What molecular properties make some cancers curable with conventional chemotherapy?’ among their provocative questions which are intended to stimulate research

both Puma and Noxa, but did not activate p21 upon DNA damage by cisplatin (Beyer et al., 2011). More recently, involvement of p73, another member of the p53 family, has been reported in GCT (Grande et al., 2012). As for p63, this transcription factor has been found to exert its function by different splice variants. Overexpression of the pro-apoptotic full length isoform TAp73 induced Noxa expression, whereas the dominant negative and anti-apoptotic splice variant ΔNp73 reduced Noxa expression upon treatment with cisplatin. Knock-down of p53 in GCT cells by small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) led to a relative decrease in the number of apoptotic cells upon cisplatin, but was insufficient to completely abrogate apoptosis. Furthermore, induction of Noxa expression remained unchanged in p53-deficient cells, suggesting a 'back-up' function of TAp73 in case of loss of p53 function in GCT (Grande et al., 2012). Finally, a correlation between Noxa expression and prognosis was found in the subgroup of tumours with EC histology, but not in all GCT.

The current model of cisplatin-sensitive GCT is graphically illustrated in a simplified form in Fig. 1. The context-specific pro-apoptotic response can be completely abrogated by epigenetic alterations occurring during differentiation, as is evidenced by the insensitivity of teratomatous elements of GCT which do not respond to chemotherapy, despite the fact that they are cytogenetically identical to other GCT histologies (Van Echten et al., 1997a,b).

### GCT AND DNA REPAIR

Another area of research efforts in GCT has concentrated on the mechanisms underlying the apparent insufficiency in DNA repair that is observed after DNA damage. GCT show a reduced capacity to remove cisplatin adducts from DNA (Köberle et al., 1996, 1997, 1999). Like the intact DDR, this has been attributed to an assumed 'all or nothing' rule in germ cells that has evolved to prevent accumulation of DNA errors in the germ line. GCT have been coined 'triple mutants' in DNA repair, as they have been shown to have low levels of XPA, ERCC1, XPF and alternatively spliced ligase III and polymerase η (Cleaver et al., 2001). Especially the first three proteins, belonging to the nucleotide excision repair (NER) mechanism, have been the subject of many examinations in the last two decades in GCT. Although proteins like XPA have been shown to be low in GCT cells (Köberle et al., 1999), there was no correlation between XPA levels and cisplatin resistance, and overexpression of XPA did not lead to increase in cisplatin resistance in GCT (Honecker et al., 2003; Köberle et al., 2008). A recent paper has suggested that high ERCC1 expression in tumour tissue is associated with lower cisplatin sensitivity, and could be a potential indicator of response to cisplatin and prognosis (Mendoza et al., 2013). However, the difference in survival between tumours negative or positive for ERCC1 expression, as assessed by immunohistochemistry, was not significantly different, making it very unlikely that this marker will clinically be useful. More detailed analysis of the NER mechanism revealed that while GCT cells are proficient in intrastrand crosslink repair, which are the majority of lesions induced by cisplatin (>90%), they are deficient in interstrand crosslink repair (Usanova et al., 2010). An interesting finding with potentially important clinical implications is the observation that while GCT cells are proficient in NER, they show deficient double strand break repair, which occurs during repair of interstrand crosslinks, and requires an intact homologous repair (HR) (Cavallo et al., 2012). Indeed, GCT cells were deficient in HR, which rendered them particularly sensitive to PARP inhibitors. Interestingly, combining PARP inhibitors with cisplatin enhanced the apoptotic response in relatively resistant cells, which might be exploited in cisplatin resistance in GCT in the future. PARP inhibitors are currently in clinical development, alone or in combination with platinum compounds, especially in tumours that are deficient in HR, like BRCA-mutated ovarian or breast cancers (for review of combination therapy, see Horton & Wilson, 2013). Figure 2 depicts graphically how in HR-deficient GCT, PARP inhibitors cause deficiency in base excision repair (BER), another DNA repair pathway, and induce apoptosis, either alone, or in combination with a DNA targeting agent such as a platinum compound.

### RESISTANCE TO CISPLATIN

Having outlined the normal response of GCT cells to DNA damage, e.g. upon exposure to cisplatin, it is worthwhile to analyse factors that negatively interfere with this inherent response pattern, causing cisplatin resistance. Notably, cisplatin resistance in GCT is believed to be multifactorial (Mayer et al., 2003), which makes it unlikely that one single therapeutic approach will be sufficient to overcome resistance in all cases. In fact,

Figure 1 Mechanisms of cisplatin sensitivity. Cisplatin-sensitive germ cell tumour cells activate the DNA damage response system upon DNA damage, e.g. by cisplatin. This activates a p53 mediated response via induction of Puma and Noxa, finally leading to apoptosis. Presence of the pluripotency and transcription factor Oct4 enhances this pro-apoptotic response. In parallel, high levels of Oct4 and the micro-RNA miR-302a are linked to low expression of p21 and failure to activate a G1 arrest. The p53 family members p63 and p73 represent alternative pathways for induction of apoptosis via Puma and Noxa. DDR, DNA damage response.

Pharmacologic inhibition of PARP (e.g., by PARP inhibitors) leads to double strand breaks during replication. Cells defective in HR, crucial for double strand break repair, are unable to maintain DNA integrity, which ultimately leads to cell death in a process called synthetic lethality. Germ cell tumour cells have been found to be impaired in HR. BER, base excision repair; HR, homologous repair; PARP, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase.

Figure 3 Mechanisms of cisplatin resistance. A defective MMR can lead to the loss of a pro-apoptotic signal, or bypassing of DNA cisplatin adducts via increased translesional synthesis, enabling cells to evade apoptosis. Alternatively, in cisplatin-resistant cells, an altered p53 response leads to activation of p21 via phosphorylation and cytoplasmic translocation, while failing to activate a pro-apoptotic response via the Bcl2-family members Puma and Noxa. Activation of p21 can also be enhanced by increased signalling via the PI3K/p-AKT pathway, see also Fig. 5. Using these mechanisms, resistant cells ultimately activate a G1/S cell cycle arrest and avoid going into apoptosis. MMR, mismatch repair.

![Diagram 2](#)

several mechanisms that are involved in cisplatin resistance of GCT have been identified so far. The most prominent are the following (see also Fig. 3): A deficient mismatch repair system (MMR) leading to microsatellite instability (MSI); induction of differentiation, characterized or even mediated by down-regulation of Oct4; loss of function of p53; epigenetic alterations; and overexpression or activation of the PI3K/pAKT pathway. All of these mechanisms will be described in more detail in the following passages.

RESISTANCE AND THE MISMATCH REPAIR SYSTEM

A number of analyses have described a correlation between a defective mismatch repair system, microsatellite instability and BRAF mutation V600E with relapse and treatment failure in GCT patients (Mayer et al., 2002; Velasco et al., 2004, 2008; Honecker et al., 2009). The underlying molecular mechanisms in GCT are unclear, and the lack of an MSI or BRAF mutant GCT cell line has hampered further functional analyses. However, it is known that the MMR system can detect (but not repair) cisplatin-induced DNA lesions, leading to a pro-apoptotic signal (Vaisman et al., 1998). Furthermore, lack of functional hMLH1 or MSH6 may lead to increased translesional synthesis and bypassing of DNA cisplatin adducts, thereby avoiding apoptosis (Bassett et al., 2002). Future studies will have to reveal the exact role of MMR in cisplatin resistance in GCT.

RESISTANCE AND CELLULAR DIFFERENTIATION

It has been known for years that epigenetic alterations that occur upon differentiation increase levels of cisplatin resistance

in GCT cells (Timmer-Bosscha et al., 1998). More recently, the molecular changes that occur in GCT cell treated with the differentiation inducing agent retinoic acid (RA) have been characterized (Skotheim et al., 2005; Honecker et al., 2014). Gutekunst et al. (2011) looked specifically for changes in genes associated with cisplatin responsiveness after RA treatment, and found that IER3, Noxa and Puma were among the most significantly down-regulated genes. Other groups have reported that loss of Oct4 expression leads to resistance in EC cells (Mueller et al., 2006, 2010; Koster et al., 2010). Events that in addition to differentiation induced by RA can lead to down-regulation of Oct4 are hypoxia (Wu et al., 2012) and cisplatin treatment (Abada & Howell, 2014). All of these are known to have a negative impact on cisplatin sensitivity (Koch et al., 2003; Abada & Howell, 2014), which is most likely mediated not only by down-regulation of Noxa and Puma but also down-regulation of miR-17/-106b family members, in turn leading to activation of p21 (Koster et al., 2010). Figure 4 graphically illustrates the interplay between events that down-regulate Oct4 expression in GCT cells, and the molecular events that follow en route to decreased cisplatin sensitivity. Obviously, this leads to the question if Oct4 expression is a critical determinant in cisplatin sensitivity? A number of clinical and pre-clinical observations argue against Oct4 as the sole determinant of cisplatin responsiveness. Clinically, it is well known that both yolk sac tumours as well as choriocarcinomas, which both lack Oct4 expression, are not less responsive to cisplatin-based chemotherapy than EC. Accordingly, already in the

Figure 4 Oct4 expression and cellular response to differentiation or stress. The pluripotency and transcription factor Oct4 has been found to be an important player in maintaining a pro-apoptotic response (see also Fig. 1) upon DNA damage. Down-regulation of Oct4, which is observed upon differentiation (i.e. induced by retinoic acid, hypoxic conditions or even cisplatin treatment itself) leads to a down-regulation of Noxa, Puma and microRNAs miR17/106b, and to an up-regulation of p21. RA, retinoic acid.

first large analysis in GCT, no correlation between Oct4 expression and treatment response was observed (Looijenga et al., 2003). Gutekunst et al. reported in 2013, that despite a decrease in cisplatin sensitivity, depletion of Oct4 did not compromise the p53 response to cisplatin. It was therefore argued that Oct4 provided a low apoptotic threshold by keeping Noxa levels high. Interestingly, treatment of Oct4-depleted cells with a proteasome inhibitor was sufficient to overcome the anti-apoptotic effect via inducing accumulation of p53 and Noxa (Gutekunst et al., 2013). In conclusion, it seems more likely that cisplatin responsiveness is determined by constitutively high levels of Noxa, rather than high expression of Oct4 in GCT, although this needs further evaluation.

Clinically, further evidence for a link between differentiation and cisplatin resistance comes from an analysis which identified the gene expression profiles of tumours that showed either good or poor response to chemotherapy (Korkola et al., 2009). Signatures that represented immune function and repression of differentiation were associated with good outcome, whereas loss of the pluripotent genotype was associated with poor outcome. However, the proposed 10-gene model has so far not been independently validated and is not used clinically.

### RESISTANCE AND P53

Another controversy in cisplatin resistance of GCT concerns the role of p53 in these tumours (Kersemaekers et al., 2002). In contrast to many other solid tumours, the mutation rate of p53 is very low (see above), which has been put forward as one of the reasons for the extreme cisplatin sensitivity of these tumours. However, a later finding reported that GCT express high levels of miR-372 and -373, which are known to numb the p53 pathway through direct inhibition of the tumour suppressors LATS2 and NEO I (Voorhoeve et al., 2006; Duale et al., 2007). Interestingly, elevated levels of miR-371 to -373 were found by a miRNA screening in 2 out of 3 cisplatin-resistant GCT sublines, possibly indicating a mechanism of p53 inhibition without altering expression or mutation status of p53 (Port et al., 2011). Another regulator of p53 is MDM2, and several reports have recently described the potent activity of disruptors of the MDM2-p53 interaction, such as nutlin-3, both alone and in combination

Figure 5 PI3K/p-AKT axis and cisplatin resistance. Several tyrosine kinase receptors can activate this signalling cascade, either as a result of ligand binding, or as a result of pathologic mutations, e.g. in the case of c-KIT. As a result of activation of PI3K, phosphorylation of AKT can occur. PTEN, which can inhibit this pathway, has been found to be lost in 50% of GCT. Phosphorylation of AKT ultimately leads, among others, to phosphorylation and activation of MDM2, and phosphorylation of p21, which thereby gets cytoplasmically translocated. The end result is induction of a cell cycle arrest and evasion of apoptosis.

with cisplatin (Bauer et al., 2010; Gutekunst et al., 2011; Koster et al., 2011). As described above, it is conceivable that p53 family members like p63 or p73 could play a role in GCT which have lost functional p53, i.e. by regulation of Puma and Noxa (Beyer et al., 2011; Grande et al., 2012). In summary, it therefore seems plausible that comparable to Oct4, p53 is not the sole determinant of cisplatin responsiveness; yet, co-targeting of p53, e.g. by nutlin-3, might well increase effectiveness of the drug in some resistant cases.

CISPLATIN RESISTANCE IN GERM CELL TUMOURS

RESISTANCE AND DNA METHYLATION
Even though clinical trials failed to demonstrate activity of both 5-azacytidine and 5-aza-deoxycytidine in GCT several decades ago (see above), recent results from preclinical analyses have rekindled interest in the role of demethylating agents in GCT. A few clinical findings point to the fact that DNA methylation might well play a critical role in drug resistance in GCT. First, it has been known for a long time that seminomas, which less frequently show cisplatin resistance than non-seminomas, are hypomethylated, whereas non-seminomas are hypermethylated (Looijenga et al., 1997; Zhang et al., 2005; Wermann et al., 2010). Interestingly, one seminoma case has been reported where hypermethylated DNA was found in a tumour showing relapse after cisplatin-based chemotherapy (Wermann et al., 2010). Koul et al. (2004) found in 2004 that sensitive and resistant non-seminomas were characterized by different promoter methylation profiles: sensitive tumours showed hypermethylation of MGMT (which is involved in DNA adduct removal) and RARB (involved in RA signalling), whereas resistant tumours had hypermethylated RASSF1A and HIC1 promoters. More recently, the effects and the mode of action of demethylating agents has been analysed in both seminoma and non-seminoma cell lines (Beyrouthy et al., 2009; Wermann et al., 2010; Biswal et al., 2012). GCT cells were highly sensitive to both 5-azacytidine and 5-aza-deoxycytidine; furthermore, cisplatin resistance could be at least partially reverted by combining a demethylating agent and cisplatin. The effect of 5-aza-deoxycytidine was dependent on intrinsically high levels of DNMT3B in GCT, and was mediated via activation of p53 targets, repression of pluripotency and activation of genes down-regulated by methylation (Beyrouthy et al., 2009; Biswal et al., 2012). The exact mechanism of action of the substance in GCT is unclear, but it is believed that it acts downstream of induction of DNA damage as a kind of trigger, steering cells away from cell cycle arrest towards a pro-apoptotic response. Given the low clinical activity of either 5-azacytidine or 5-aza-deoxycytidine alone in patients with relapsed GCT, future trials should test the combination of a demethylating agent with a platinum compound.

attempts using the tyrosine kinase inhibitor sunitinib in cisplatin-resistant GCT have failed to demonstrate major activity (see above), pre-clinical results indicate that other compounds targeting either tyrosine kinase receptors or downstream signaling components of this pathway may well be active in GCT, especially when combined with either cisplatin, or other pathway inhibitors (Castillo-Avila et al., 2009; Nitzsche et al., 2012; Juliachs et al., 2013, 2014).

TACKLING CISPLATIN RESISTANCE IN THE CLINICS – WHERE SHOULD WE GO FROM HERE?
For years, identification of active compounds in cisplatin-resistant GCT has been purely empirical by trial and error. More recently, however, a better understanding of mechanisms of resistant disease has emerged, and will allow more tailored approaches. Until the identification of highly active compounds that will eventually make platinum compounds, the most active substances in GCT treatment so far, dispensable, it seems advisable to combine new agents with platinum salts in an attempt to restore platinum sensitivity, as has been shown in numerous preclinical experiments. Even though attempts to combine targeted therapy using small molecules together with classical cytotoxic agents ('chemotherapy') have so far been mostly unsuccessful in solid tumours, pre-clinical evidence seems to suggest that this approach might indeed be useful in GCT. Galluzzi et al. have distinguished four different levels of cisplatin resistance: pre-target, on-target, post-target and off-target (Galluzzi et al., 2012, 2014). In GCT, pre-target resistance seems to be of little importance; however, on-target resistance could be overcome by specifically targeting DNA repair mechanisms (e.g. by BRCA) using PARP inhibitors to induce synthetic lethality. A plethora of possibilities exist to increase post- and off-target activities. These include inhibition of MDM2 by nutlin-3, combinations of various pathway inhibitors, especially targeting the PDGFRβ/PI3K/p-AKT pathway by small molecules or antibodies, proteasome inhibitors and finally drugs inducing epigenetic alterations, such as demethylating agents and HDAC inhibitors. If responsiveness to apoptotic stimuli really is the default pathway in GCT, resistance to agents like cisplatin must be the result of active changes to one or several pathways. Identification, and eventually pharmacological reversal of these mechanisms are key in the aspiration to turn cisplatin-resistant GCT into a curable disease. The chances to achieve this seem better today than ever before.

MEETING COMMENTS

Luiz Franca (Belo Horizonte, Brazil)
Our studies on spermatogonial stem cells in vertebrates indicate that there are different populations with different stemness capacity. Some have a capacity for self renewal, some produce proliferating spermatogonia, and some are low cycling quiescent cells. Possibly not all of these types of cells are attacked by drugs. If there is a similar diversity of cell types in testicular cancer this could account for a population of cisplatin-resistant cells. Has this aspect of malignant germ cells been studied?

Friedemann Honecker (St Gallen, Switzerland)

I am not aware of any such studies. A cell which is under stress might result in p21 activation which can cause senescence. However, germ cells, embryonic stem cells and embryonal carcinoma (EC) cells are not prone to this mechanism: they have an all-or-nothing response whereby damaged cells do not become senescent but undergo apoptosis. It is known that more differentiated teratomas cells are likely to show low proliferation and are more resistant to cisplatin. In these cells, the balance is towards blocking the cell cycle at the G1/S checkpoint producing quiescent cells rather than apoptosis.

J. Wolter Oosterhuis (Rotterdam, Netherlands)

I am intrigued by the disappearance of EC cells following cisplatin therapy whereas somatic cells survive. In normal circumstances, yolk sac tumour (YST) cells and trophoblastic/choriocarcinoma (CC) cells are also sensitive to cisplatin therapy and other DNA-damaging agents because they are poorly equipped for DNA repair. It might be that EC cells, YST cells and CC cells are short-lived “throw-away” cells which only exist during pregnancy and do not require sophisticated mechanisms for DNA repair. Imperfect repair of DNA in a damaged cell readily leads to cell death by apoptosis.

Friedemann Honecker

I agree that EC, YST and CC cells could be considered as being short-lived one-time-only cells. There is no difference in their genetic background, therefore all the differences are epigenetic. Possibly other mechanisms are activated such as in the presence of proteasome inhibitors which can switch on p53 and NOXA in the absence of OCT 3/4. I believe that NOXA activation is the key to apoptosis and cisplatin sensitivity. NOXA is switched on not only by OCT 3/4 but also by other factors such as p53 and possibly also p63 and p73, irrespective of the presence of OCT 3/4. Loss of OCT 3/4 results in cisplatin resistance, but this is not the only factor determining sensitivity or resistance. NOXA is activated in EC cells and also in more differentiated cells including YST and CC cells. An alternative pathway to OCT 3/4 for NOXA activation must be in place, otherwise all YST and CC tumours would all become resistant to cisplatin.

Jourik Gietema (Groningen, Netherlands)

This is an excellent overview. In the last 2 years, small low-power phase II studies have tested small molecules in patients. How do you translate your new insights into small and smart clinical studies so that they can be used clinically? You have described several interesting molecules and we must consider how to get these molecules to cisplatin-resistant patients.

Friedemann Honecker

The only way to test these therapeutic agents is by international collaboration. In the last 3 years, three different groups in Germany, US and Slovakia have all tested the same drug, sunitinib. Rather than all testing the same molecule, it would have been more productive if different centres had tested different molecules. The same is happening for everolimus which has been tested in Germany and Slovakia, and also it almost happened with cabazitaxel which is not a new molecule, but is a new taxane. When a new compound becomes available,

everyone tries to test it, but we should get together as oncologists in order to have rational international co-operation, whereby different centres assess different molecules so that patients will benefit from progress more rapidly.
