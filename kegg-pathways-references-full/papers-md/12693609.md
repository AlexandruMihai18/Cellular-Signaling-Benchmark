# Signaling through NO and cGMP-dependent protein kinases

**Jens Schlossmann, Robert Feil and Franz Hofmann**

The gaseous molecule nitric oxide (NO) modulates a large variety of physiological functions including vascular tone, intestinal motility, platelet aggregation, proliferation, apoptosis, and neurotransmission. NO initiates diverse cellular signaling cascades which comprise nitrosylation of proteins, adenosine 5′-diphosphate (ADP)-ribosylation, or stimulation of soluble guanylyl cyclases which catalyze intracellular guanosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate (cGMP) synthesis. cGMP activates cGMP-dependent protein kinases (cGK) which mediate localized and global signaling. Furthermore, cGMP regulates the activity of phosphodies- terases (PDE) which modulate the duration and amplitude of cyclic nucleotide signaling. Two different types of cGK are expressed in mammals, cGKI and cGKII. Activation of the NO/cGMP/cGKI pathway induces relaxation of smooth muscle by lowering the cytosolic calcium level and/or by calcium desensitization of the contractile elements.

## Introduction

For more than a hundred years, organic nitrates have been used in medicine for treating cardiovascular diseases including angina pectoris. However, it was not until 1977 that nitric oxide (NO) was identified as the therapeutically effective compound released from these pro-drugs (1). Three years later, Furchgott & Zawadzki (2) recognized that stimulation of vascular endothelial cells by acetylcholine leads to the synthesis of a smooth muscle relaxing factor, named endothelial derived relaxation factor (EDRF). The physiological importance of NO was established some years later, when it was shown that EDRF is identical with NO (3, 4). NO is synthesized from L-arginine by three different NO-synthases—the endothelial eNOS, the inducible iNOS and the neuronal nNOS. NO is involved in the regulation of vascular tone and platelet aggregation, has inotropic effects on the heart, is secreted by immune cells mediating cytotoxicity, and modulates neurotrans- mission. NO signals by different mechanisms including nitrosylation of ion channels, ADP-ribosylation of proteins, and stimulation of cGMP synthesis by soluble guanylyl cyclases. NO-independent cGMP synthesis is stimulated by membrane-integrated gua- nylyl cyclases which are activated by extracellular binding of specific peptides, e.g. natriuretic peptides. The atrial- and the brain-type natriuretic peptides (ANP, BNP) are secreted by the heart and regulate natriuresis and blood pressure.

As NO, cGMP has also different effectors: cGMP-activated and -inhibited cAMP-degrading phospho- diesterases (PDE 2 and PDE 3) and cGMP-binding cGMP-degrading PDE 5 (5), cyclic nucleotide-gated cation channels (CNG) which are involved in sensory processes (6), and cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinases (cGK). In mammals, two different cGK genes are known to modulate different physiological func- tions. cGKI regulates vascular and intestinal tone and platelet aggregation (7, 8), whereas cGKII modulates intestinal ion secretion and bone growth (9). The cGKI gene encodes two isoforms, cGKIα and cGKIβ, which vary only in their amino termini (~100 amino acids). The amino terminal region mediates dimeriza- tion of two identical kinase subunits, inhibition of kinase activity in the absence of cGMP, and interac- tion with other proteins. The importance of cGKI for vascular tone is underscored by the observation that cGKI-deficient mice have a high blood pressure (10).

This review summarizes the recent findings on molecular signaling via NO/cGMP/cGKI in smooth muscle. First, we will describe the mechanisms leading to smooth muscle contraction and then we will discuss different sites at which NO/cGMP/cGKI might act to induce smooth muscle relaxation.

Regulation of smooth muscle contractility

Smooth muscle contraction can be increased by calcium-dependent and calcium-independent pathways (Fig. 1). Agonists (e.g., phenylephrine) that activate Gq/11-coupled receptors increase the cytosolic calcium concentration by stimulation of phospholipase Cβ and consecutive synthesis of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP₃). Then, InsP₃-activated calcium channels in the endoplasmic reticulum, the InsP₃R, are stimulated leading to an emptying of the calcium stores and a rise of the cytosolic calcium concentration. In addition, activation of phospholipase C might lead to the opening of store-operated channels (SOC) resulting in extracellular calcium entry and depolarization of the smooth muscle membrane to values that open voltage-dependent L-type calcium channels (Fig. 1) (11). To date, the best candidates for SOCs are the transient receptor potential (Trp) channels. TrpC1, TrpC3, and TrpC6 are expressed in vascular smooth muscle and TrpC4 is expressed in endothelial cells. Interestingly, TrpC3 directly interacts with the

Key messages
- Nitric oxide (NO) is synthesized by NO-synthases from L-arginine. NO leads to several physiological reactions including nitrosylation of proteins (e.g., ion channels), ADP-ribosylation and stimulation of cGMP synthesis via activation of soluble guanylyl cyclases.
- Cellular targets of cGMP are e.g., phosphodiesterases and cGMP-dependent protein kinases (cGK). In many cell types (e.g., smooth muscle cells, platelets) cGKI signaling lowers the hormone-stimulated intracellular calcium concentration and decreases the calcium sensitivity of the contractile apparatus.
- cGKI activates diverse signal transduction pathways underscoring its pleiotropic function.

Figure 2: NO/cGMP/cGKI-mediated mechanisms for smooth muscle relaxation. cGKI affects diverse signaling pathways leading to smooth muscle relaxation. cGKI leads to reduction of agonist-induced intracellular calcium rise either by inhibition of the calcium release from the ER or by decreased calcium influx through membrane hyperpolarization. Furthermore, cGKI leads to calcium desensitization of contractile elements via activation of MP or to prolongation of the cGMP signal via inhibition of the cGMP degrading enzyme PDE5.

InsP$_{3}$R (reviewed in (12)). TrpC6 has been implicated in the regulation of smooth muscle tone (13). Besides SOCs, calcium-activated chloride channels might also be involved in agonist-mediated membrane depolarization (14). Finally, the rise of cytosolic calcium mediated by release from intracellular stores and/or influx of extracellular calcium activates the calcium/calmodulin-dependent myosin light chain kinase (MLCK). MLCK phosphorylates the myosin light chain II (MLC) at Ser19, a prerequisite for smooth muscle contraction (15) (Fig. 1).

Some agonists (e.g. angiotensin II, vasopressin) activate not only G$_{q/11}$ but also G$_{12/13}$ leading to calcium sensitization of the contractile elements (Fig. 1). The G$_{12/13}$ pathway links the hormone response to Rho/Rho kinase signaling. In its GTP bound form, the small GTPase Rho translocates from the cytosol to the membrane and enhances Rho kinase activity. Rho kinase phosphorylates in vitro the 130 kDa myosin-binding subunit of myosin phosphatase (MP) at aa Thr695/697 (chicken/rat) and thereby reduces MP activity (Fig. 1). Furthermore, it has been

reported that Rho kinase can directly phosphorylate MLC, but this mechanism is probably not occurring in vivo (16).

Recently, an endogenous smooth muscle MP kinase (zipper-interacting protein (ZIP)-like kinase) was identified which is associated with MP and phosphorylates the myosin-binding subunit at the same site (Thr695/697) as Rho kinase. However, the ZIP-like kinase is insensitive to the Rho kinase inhibitor Y27362 that inhibits contraction in vivo (17). In conclusion, ZIP-like kinase could act either downstream of Rho kinase mediating a link between the membrane-bound activated Rho kinase and the mainly myofibrillar-associated MP, or it could function independently of Rho/Rho kinase signaling.

Phosphorylation of the smooth muscle protein kinase C-potentiated inhibitor protein of 17 kDa (CPI-17) at Thr38 (CPI-17-P) by either Rho kinase or an atypical Ca²⁺-independent protein kinase C (PKC) represents a further possibility to inhibit the MP enzyme (Fig. 1). CPI-17-P inhibits MP activity independent on the phosphorylation of the myosin binding subunit (18).

Inhibition of MP by either Rho kinase, ZIP-like kinase or CPI-17-P shifts the equilibrium of phosphorylated MLC/dephosphorylated MLC towards phosphorylated MLC (Fig. 1). This mechanism favors smooth muscle contraction at relatively low calcium levels, and is therefore termed calcium sensitization. The importance of Rho/Rho kinase signal transduction for the contractility of smooth muscle is underscored by the observation that Y27632 lowers the blood pressure of hypertensive rats (19).

### Signaling through NO/cGMP/cGKI

In general, NO could induce relaxation of smooth muscle by reduction of the hormone-stimulated intracellular calcium release and/or by lowering the calcium sensitivity of the contractile apparatus. Although NO can act via diverse signaling pathways, it is generally accepted that stimulation of soluble guanylyl cyclase, cGMP synthesis, and activation of cGKI are critically involved in NO-mediated smooth muscle relaxation (Fig. 2).

The agonist-stimulated calcium rise can be inhibited by NO at different sites affecting the synthesis of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP₃), the release of calcium from intracellular stores, the re-uptake of calcium into intracellular stores, and the influx of extracellular calcium.

It was shown that the G protein-coupled thromboxane receptor can be phosphorylated by cGKI, which could reduce InsP₃-synthesis after receptor activation (20). Furthermore, cGKI might directly inhibit InsP₃-synthesis by phospholipase C (21, 22).

However, the molecular cGKI target for the observed inhibition of InsP₃-synthesis has not been identified so far and is most likely not phospholipase C itself.

The calcium release from intracellular stores can also be modulated by cGKI (23) (Fig. 2). The calcium release channel InsP₃ receptor (InsP₃R) type I is phosphorylated by cGKI, but the in vitro and in vivo phosphorylation sites are not identical and the functional importance of the phosphorylation is not clear (24, 25). In smooth muscle microsomes, a cGKIβ-associated and -phosphorylated protein termed IRAG was identified that assembles in a ternary complex together with cGKIβ and InsP₃R type I (26). Phosphorylation of IRAG at Ser696 by cGKIβ inhibits the InsP₃-induced calcium release (27) (Fig. 2). Both cGKI isoforms, cGKIα and cGKIβ, are expressed in smooth muscle, but little information exists about their specific functions. Using a gene deletion/rescue approach it was shown that cGKIα but not cGKIβ inhibits noradrenaline-induced calcium transients in aortic smooth muscle cells, probably by inhibition of calcium release from intracellular stores (28) (Fig. 2). These results indicate that cGKIα is the determining isozyme for the calcium-dependent regulation of vascular tone.

The calcium-uptake mediated by the calcium adenosine 5′-trisphosphatase (ATPase) of the endoplasmic reticulum is inhibited by phospholamban. Smooth muscle-specific overexpression of phospholamban leads to an increased calcium concentration and force in response to the muscarinic agonist carbachol (29). Phospholamban-deficient smooth muscle cells show a faster rise and a more rapid decrease of phenylephrine-stimulated calcium transients compared to wild type cells. cGMP- or adenosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent phosphorylation of phospholamban abolishes its inhibitory effect on calcium re-uptake and thereby results in enhanced calcium re-uptake and a decreased cytosolic calcium concentration (30). Interestingly, only a small fraction of phospholamban coprecipitates with cGKI, IRAG and InsP₃R (Koller A, Schlossmann J, Ashman K, Uttweiler-Joseph S, Ruth P, Hofmann F, unpublished data, Institut für Pharmakologie und Toxikologie, TU München, 2002). It was therefore not surprising that cGMP/cGKI-dependent relaxation of aortic smooth muscle was only marginally altered in phospholamban knockout mice (31).

An additional mechanism that regulates the cytosolic calcium concentration is the activation of potassium efflux via big calcium-dependent voltage-gated potassium channels (maxiK). Activation of these channels hyperpolarizes the membrane potential. Closure of the L-type calcium channel abolishes calcium influx and relaxes smooth muscle cells. Previous studies showed that the maxiK channel can be directly phosphorylated by cGKI at Ser1072 which

results in enhanced channel activity (32) (Fig. 2). The analysis of various maxiK channel splice variants showed that PKC phosphorylation of the maxiK channel is a prerequisite for the cGKI-dependent activation of the channel (33). In addition, direct nitrosylation of maxiK channels associated with an increased open probability was reported (34). The maxiK-specific blocker iberiotoxin partially inhibits cGMP-induced smooth muscle relaxation, suggesting that activation of maxiK channels is indeed involved in NO/cGMP-mediated vasorelaxation (7).

In summary, a number of cGKI-dependent mechanisms have been identified that regulate the cytosolic calcium concentration (Fig. 2). The physiological significance of these different pathways for the regulation of smooth muscle contractility is not clear up to now. Probably, the inhibition of the intracellular calcium release and the decrease in calcium influx are more important for regulation of contractility than the activation of calcium re-uptake by phosphorylation of phospholamban.

cGKI apparently also regulates the calcium sensitivity of the contractile apparatus. cGKI phosphorylates RhoA at Ser188 inducing RhoA translocation from the membrane to the cytosol whereby RhoA is inactivated (Fig. 2). This reaction would decrease the activation of Rho kinase and increase the activity of MP, thereby leading to calcium desensitization and relaxation (35). MP is also inhibited by CPI-17-P which itself is phosphorylated by Rho kinase or a Ca²⁺-independent PKC (see above). cGMP leads to dephosphorylation of CPI-17-P, but the involved CPI-17-P phosphatase has not been identified to date (36). Thus, cGKI-mediated activation of MP and calcium desensitization might involve inhibition of Rho/Rho kinase-dependent and -independent pathways.

It was reported that cGKIα directly binds and phosphorylates the 130 kDa myosin-binding subunit of MP which might activate MP and lead to decreased level of phosphorylated MLC (37) (Fig. 2). The myosin-binding subunit of MP from mammalian smooth muscle and chicken gizzard contains a carboxy terminal leucine zipper motif which interacts with cGKI and is essential for cGKI-mediated relaxation (38). Nevertheless, so far no change in MP activity has been found with the cGKI-mediated phosphorylation of myosin-binding subunit.

In conclusion, several possible mechanisms and substrate proteins have recently been discussed regulating calcium desensitization via MP including RhoA, CPI-17-P and the myosin binding subunit of MP. However, the physiological role and importance of these substrates has to be established in the future. Furthermore, additional substrates might be identified in smooth muscle e.g. the CPI-17-P phosphatase or further MP activating substrate proteins.

Protein phosphorylation by cGKI could also modify the cytoskeletal architecture of smooth muscle cells. One of the best characterized cGKI substrates is the focal adhesion protein VASP (vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein). Interestingly, disruption of the VASP gene in mice does not alter the calcium-dependent adhesion or aggregation of platelets, and smooth muscle function (39, 40). Although the focal adhesion protein Ena (41) might compensate the function of VASP in VASP knockout mice, these results challenge the physiological importance of cGKI signaling via VASP.

cGKI might also directly influence the actin/myosin interaction as phosphorylation of troponin T by cGKI in cardiomyocytes was reported (42). Interestingly, a 20 kD heat shock protein (Hsp20) which contains a sequence homologous to the actin-binding region of troponin T was found to be involved in cGKI-induced smooth muscle relaxation (39). Therefore, the actin-binding sequence of Hsp20 could play a role in the cGMP-mediated calcium desensitization of the contractile filaments (43).

Modulation of the cytoskeletal arrangement including actin/myosin and focal adhesion is an important process for relaxation. Therefore, besides the proposed mechanisms several possible further cytoskeletal regulators could be identified in the future. For example, a cGKI-substrate protein CRP2 (cystein rich protein 2) has recently been identified which might be involved in the assembly of focal adhesions (44).

A further mechanism involved in the regulation of the smooth muscle tone is the modulation of the amplitude and duration of the cGMP signal. Degradation of cGMP by phosphodiesterases in smooth muscle is mainly mediated by cGMP hydrolysis through PDE5. cGKI-dependent phosphorylation of this enzyme at Ser92 leads to enhanced hydrolysis of cGMP (45, 46). In conclusion, cGKI-mediated phosphorylation of PDE5 could modulate the strength and duration of the cGMP-mediated smooth muscle relaxation.

### Conclusions

As described above, a number of mechanisms have been identified by which the NO/cGMP/cGKI pathway could modulate smooth muscle tone. It is anticipated that some of these mechanisms are activated in the same cell at different times and stimulation protocols. Other mechanisms may only be operative in a subset of smooth muscles, i.e. in intestinal or arterial smooth muscle. However, we want to remind the reader that the importance of these mechanisms for the regulation of the contractility in vivo is not known to date. Analysis of the physiological significance of these pathways will be a

major task in the future. Furthermore, some identified NO/cGMP/cGKI-regulated mechanisms possibly do not play a major role for the contractile response but might be important for other aspects of smooth muscle function such as growth and differentiation.
