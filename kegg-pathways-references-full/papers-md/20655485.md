### GABA<sub>B</sub> Receptors: Physiological Functions and Mechanisms of Diversity

---

#### Abstract

GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors are the G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) for γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors are implicated in the etiology of a variety of psychiatric disorders and are considered attractive drug targets. With the cloning of GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor subunits 13 years ago, substantial progress was made in the understanding of the molecular structure, physiology, and pharmacology of these receptors. However, it remained puzzling that native studies demonstrated a heterogeneity of GABA<sub>B</sub> responses

that contrasted with a very limited diversity of cloned GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor subunits. Until recently, the only firmly established molecular diversity consisted of two GABA<sub>B1</sub> subunit isoforms, GABA<sub>B1a</sub> and GABA<sub>B1b</sub>, which assemble with GABA<sub>B2</sub> subunits to generate heterodimeric GABA<sub>B(1a,2)</sub> and GABA<sub>B(1b,2)</sub> receptors. Using genetic, ultrastructural, biochemical, and electrophysiological approaches, it has been possible to identify functional properties that segregate with these two receptors. Moreover, receptor modifications and factors that can alter the receptor response have been identified. Most importantly, recent data reveal the existence of a family of auxiliary GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor subunits that assemble as tetramers with the C-terminal domain of GABA<sub>B2</sub> subunits and drastically alter pharmacology and kinetics of the receptor response. The data are most consistent with native GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors minimally forming dimeric assemblies of units composed of GABA<sub>B1</sub>, GABA<sub>B2</sub>, and a tetramer of auxiliary subunits. This represents a substantial departure from current structural concepts for GPCRs.

### I. Introduction

GABA is the main inhibitory transmitter in the vertebrate central nervous system. GABAergic neurotransmission relies on two classes of receptors. Ionotropic GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors mediate fast GABA responses by triggering chloride channel openings. Metabotropic GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors are members of the family 3 (or family C) G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and mediate slower GABA responses by activating G-proteins and influencing second messenger systems (Bettler & Tiao, 2006; Bowery, 2006; Couve et al., 2000; Kornau, 2006; Ulrich & Bettler, 2007). These two classes of receptors were originally discriminated based on pharmacological differences (Bowery et al., 1980; Hill & Bowery, 1981). It was observed that the evoked release of adrenaline, dopamine, and serotonin was decreased by GABA acting on a receptor different from the known GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors. This decrease of evoked neurotransmitter release was surprisingly independent of the GABA<sub>A</sub> antagonist bicuculline but sensitive to baclofen. The terms GABA<sub>A</sub> and GABA<sub>B</sub> were introduced to distinguish bicuculline- from baclofen-sensitive receptors (Hill & Bowery, 1981). Since then, kinetic and pharmacological differences between native GABA<sub>B</sub> responses further suggested the existence of molecularly distinct GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor subtypes. However, cloning of GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors revealed an unexpectedly low structural diversity, unlike what is observed with the sequence-related metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs). Only two heteromeric GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors consisting of GABA<sub>B1a</sub> or GABA<sub>B1b</sub> subunits in combination with GABA<sub>B2</sub> subunits were identified. It was therefore important to address how such a limited structural diversity leads to a variety of pharmacologically and kinetically distinct native GABA<sub>B</sub> responses. Here,we review evidence for heterogeneous native GABA<sub>B</sub> responses and discuss mechanisms that generate functional and pharmacological diversity in the GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor system.

# II. Physiological Functions of GABA<sub>B</sub> Receptors

GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors influence their effectors via the Gα and Gβγ subunits of the activated G protein. The first GABA<sub>B</sub> effector characterized was adenylate cyclase whose activity was shown to be inhibited via the Gα<sub>i</sub>/Gα<sub>o</sub> subunits (Xu & Wojcik, 1986). Unfortunately, the physiological consequences of this modulation are poorly understood but include effects on transcription factors, kinases and intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling (Couve et al., 2002; New et al., 2006; Ren & Mody, 2003; Steiger et al., 2004). In comparison to Gα-mediated signaling, Gβγ-mediated signaling is much better understood. The main Gβγ-dependent effectors of presynaptic GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors are P/Q- and N-type voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (Barral et al., 2000; Bussieres & El Manira, 1999; Chen & van den Pol, 1998). GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors inhibit these Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels at excitatory and inhibitory terminals, thereby restricting neurotransmitter release. By definition, GABA<sub>B</sub> autoreceptors inhibit GABA release while GABA<sub>B</sub> heteroreceptors decrease the release of other neurotransmitters, including, for example, glutamate, dopamine, adrenaline, or serotonin. Depending on whether the terminal releases an inhibitory or excitatory neurotransmitter, presynaptic GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors increase or decrease the excitability of the postsynaptic neuron. Presynaptic GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors restrict neurotransmitter release not only by inhibiting Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels but also by retarding the recruitment of synaptic vesicles (Sakaba & Neher, 2003). Recent evidence also suggests that presynaptic GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors couple to inwardly rectifying Kir3-type K<sup>+</sup> channels (also designated GIRK channels) to inhibit glutamate release (Fernandez-Alacid et al., 2009; Ladera et al., 2008). However, Kir3 channels are generally considered the main effectors of postsynaptic GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors (Luscher et al., 1997; Wagner & Dekin, 1993). GABA<sub>B</sub>-mediated activation of Kir3 channels produces slow inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) by inducing K<sup>+</sup> efflux, which hyperpolarizes the membrane and shunts excitatory currents. Postsynaptic GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors also down-regulate Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, which inhibits dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup>-spike propagation (Perez-Garci et al., 2006).

Interestingly, GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor activation not only modulates neuronal firing but also triggers long-term changes in synaptic strength (Davies et al., 1991; Huang et al., 2005; Patenaude et al., 2003). Postsynaptic GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors limit the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) by promoting blockade of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors by Mg<sup>2+</sup> (Otmakhova & Lisman, 2004). In contrast, autoreceptors facilitate LTPby restricting postsynaptic inhibition (Davies & Collingridge, 1996; Davies et al., 1991). GABA<sub>B</sub> heteroreceptors mediate heterosynaptic depression of glutamate release at hippocampal synapses (Guetg et al., 2009; Vogt & Nicoll, 1999). This was shown to modulate the expression of LTP at synapses in the hippocampus and the lateral amygdala (LA) (Shaban et al., 2006; Vigot et al., 2006). GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors were also identified on glial cells, including astrocytes in the hippocampus, where they contribute to heterosynaptic depression (Oka et al., 2006; Serrano et al., 2006) and to activity-dependent modulation of synaptic transmission (Kang et al., 1998).

Electrophysiological detection of GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor activity often necessitates strong stimulation intensities (Scanziani, 2000). This suggests that GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors are located at a certain distance from release sites, thus necessitating pooling of synaptically released GABA for receptor activation. Accordingly, ultrastructural studies detect presynaptic GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors mostly at extrasynaptic sites. GABA<sub>B</sub> heteroreceptors are enriched on the rim of glutamate release sites (Guetg et al., 2009; Kulik et al., 2003, 2006; Lacey et al., 2005) where they are activated under conditions of high GABA release (Chandler et al., 2003; Guetg et al., 2009; Vogt & Nicoll, 1999). Postsynaptic GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors are present on dendritic shafts and on the extrasynaptic membrane of spines (Guetg et al., 2009; Kulik et al., 2003). Presumably, GABA<sub>B</sub>-mediated activation of Kir3 channels in the spines balances excitatory inputs by hyperpolarizing the membrane and inducing shunting inhibition (Isaacson, Solis, & Nicoll, 1993). Dendritic GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors also play a role in delaying and inhibiting back-propagating action potentials and Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes (Perez-Garci et al., 2006; Zilberter et al., 1999).

### III. Heterogeneity of Native GABA<sub>B</sub> Responses

As highlighted in the previous section, GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors are involved in a variety of neuronal functions. During the past 20 years, heterogeneous native GABA<sub>B</sub> responses suggested the existence of multiple receptor subtypes (Bonanno & Raiteri, 1993b; Raiteri, 2006, 2008). Below, we review some of the pharmacological and functional evidence for differences between (A) pre- and postsynaptic GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors, (B) presynaptic GABA<sub>B</sub> auto- and heteroreceptors, and (C) postsynaptic GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors on different cell types.

#### A. Heterogeneity between Pre- and Postsynaptic GABA<sub>B</sub> Responses

Differences in native GABA<sub>B</sub> responses were first observed between pre- and postsynaptic receptors (Bowery, 1993; Nicoll, 2004). Electrophysiological studies in the neocortex and hippocampus showed different
sensitivities of pre- and postsynaptic GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors to the antagonist phaclofen and to pertussis toxin, which suggested the existence of distinct receptors (Colmers & Williams, 1988; Deisz et al., 1993; Dutar & Nicoll, 1988; Harrison, 1990). However, studies in other brain regions or hippocampal cultures using more potent GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor antagonists did not detect any pharmacological difference between pre- and postsynaptic receptors (Seabrook et al., 1990; Thompson & Gahwiler, 1992; Yoon & Rothman, 1991). Still, several studies showed divergence in the potency of GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor agonists and antagonists in a variety of preparations (Chan et al., 1998; Colmers & Williams, 1988; Cruz et al., 2004; Deisz et al., 1993; Pozza et al., 1999; Yamada et al., 1999). For instance, an electrophysiological study determined the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) of various GABA<sub>B</sub> antagonists needed to inhibit the GABA<sub>B</sub>-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP<sub>B</sub>) and the paired-pulse widening of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazol-4-propionate-mediated (AMPA) excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) in the CA1 region of hippocampus (Pozza et al., 1999). The authors showed that 5-to 10-fold higher concentrations of antagonists were required to block presynaptic versus postsynaptic GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors (Table I). In addition, other studies showed that the selective GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor agonist baclofen inhibits inhibitory and excitatory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs and EPSCs, respectively) with a lower half-maximal effective concentration (EC<sub>50</sub>) than the one required to activate postsynaptic K<sup>+</sup> currents in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and in the CA3 region of the hippocampus (Cruz et al., 2004; R. Seddik unpublished observation). This indicates that baclofen more efficiently activates presynaptic GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors (Table 1). Importantly, differences in agonist potency can be due to differences in the expression level of receptor or effector protein, the coupling efficiency as well as the threshold for effector activation. Differences in agonist potency therefore do not necessarily reflect molecularly distinct receptor subtypes. Only differences in the rank order of drug potencies would clearly argue for receptor subtypes but no such differences were reported.

## B. Heterogeneity between Presynaptic GABA<sub>B</sub> Responses

Considerable evidence has accumulated over the years to support differences between GABA<sub>B</sub> auto- and heteroreceptors (Bowery et al., 2002; Raiteri, 2006, 2008). This is predominantly supported by studies investigating the effects of various GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor antagonists on neurotransmitter release in different preparations (Bonanno et al., 1996, 1997, 1999; Fassio et al., 1994). As shown in Table II, different antagonist potencies were reported for auto- and heteroreceptors but also for heteroreceptors from rat and human neocortex. Additional studies showed pharmacological differences between autoreceptors in cerebral cortex and spinal cord suggesting extensive heterogeneity in

presynaptic GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors (Bonanno & Raiteri, 1993a; Bonanno et al., 1998). However, the notion of distinct presynaptic GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors has been open to dispute since other release studies detected no pharmacological difference between GABA<sub>B</sub> auto- and heteroreceptors (Waldmeier et al., 1994). Waldmeier and colleagues showed that the antagonists CGP35348 and CGP52432, which previously were reported to have distinct potencies at auto- and heteroreceptors, regulate GABA and glutamate release with similar potencies. Still, pharmacologically distinct presynaptic GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors were also suggested by electrophysiological experiments. In the dorsolateral septal nucleus, the agonist CGP44533 inhibited glutamate-mediated postsynaptic currents with higher efficacy and potency than GABA<sub>A</sub>-mediated currents. This suggests a pharmacological difference between GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors at glutamatergic and GABAergic terminals (Yu et al., 1999). Thus, despite some conflicting data, it appears that presynaptic GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors exhibit pharmacological differences. Based on such differences, some investigators proposed the existence of molecularly distinct GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor subtypes (Bonanno & Raiteri, 1993b; Raiteri, 2008).

In addition to differences in drug potencies, presynaptic GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors also differ in their distribution and desensitization properties. A striking example of a differential distribution of the GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors is observed in the glutamatergic afferents projecting to principal neurons and to interneurons in the LA (Pan et al., 2009). Preembedding immunogold labeling and electron microscopy showed that GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors in terminals contacting interneurons are located further away from active zones than those in terminals contacting principal neurons. Consequently, baclofen more efficiently inhibits glutamate release at terminals projecting to principal neurons than at terminals projecting to interneurons, suggesting that GABA<sub>B</sub>-mediated control of release in the LA is differentially regulated. Distinct kinetic properties between presynaptic GABA<sub>B</sub> responses were also reported, in line with GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor heterogeneity. In CA3 neurons, GABA<sub>B</sub>-mediated inhibition of GABA but not glutamate release desensitizes during continuous agonist application (Tosetti et al., 2004). It was suggested that the specific loss of GABA<sub>B</sub>-mediated inhibition of GABA release, induced by receptor desensitization, triggers persistent epileptiform discharges in the neonatal hippocampus (Tosetti et al., 2004). Although far from being conclusive, a significant body of data suggests the existence of pharmacologically and functionally distinct GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors at glutamatergic and GABAergic terminals.

## C. Heterogeneity of Postsynaptic GABA<sub>B</sub> Responses

A remarkable example of heterogeneous postsynaptic GABA<sub>B</sub> responses is found in the VTA, a brain structure involved in the rewarding effects of drugs of abuse (Luscher, 2009). The VTA contains GABAergic interneurons
as well as dopaminergic (DA) neurons implicated in the reward circuitry. Using patch-clamp electrophysiology, Cruz and colleagues found that GABAergic and DA neurons produce $GABAB$-mediated Kir3 currents with distinct pharmacological and kinetic properties (Cruz et al., 2004). At GABAergic neurons, baclofen induced a high-potency nondesensitizing current while it evoked a low-potency desensitizing current in DA neurons. Accordingly, $GABAB$ agonists have bidirectional effects on the excitability of DA neurons. Low agonist concentrations selectively inhibit GABAergic neurons and thereby increase the firing frequency of DA neurons. High agonist concentrations directly inhibit DA neurons and hence reduce their firing frequency. Low-affinity $GABAB$ agonists like the recreational drug γ-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) therefore carry an abuse liability while high-affinity agonists, such as baclofen, are of potential therapeutic benefit in the treatment of addiction. $GABAB$ responses with distinct susceptibilities to antagonists were also observed by studying the inhibition of cAMP production in cerebral cortical slices (Cunningham & Enna, 1996). It was therefore proposed that distinct $GABAB$ receptor subtypes regulate adenylyl cyclase activity.

## IV. Functions of the Cloned $GABAB$ Receptor Subtypes

Given the heterogeneity observed with native $GABAB$ responses, many researchers in the field expected the existence of multiple $GABAB$ receptor subtypes. However, cloning efforts only produced two molecular subtypes of $GABAB$ receptors (Marshall et al., 1999). Molecular diversity in the $GABAB$ system is based on the subunit isoforms $GABAB_{1a}$ and $GABAB_{1b}$, both of which combine with $GABAB_{2}$ to form heteromeric $GABAB_{(1a,2)}$ and $GABAB_{(1b,2)}$ receptors. Recombinant experiments showed that heteromerization is mandatory for cell surface expression and G-protein coupling of the receptor. Specifically, it was shown that $GABAB_{2}$ is critical for the transport of $GABAB_{1}$ to the cell surface and activation of the G-protein while $GABAB_{1}$ contains the agonist binding site (Fig. 1; Calver et al., 2001; Couve et al., 1998; Duthey et al., 2002; Galvez et al., 2001; Havlickova et al., 2002; Margeta-Mitrovic et al., 2001; Pagano et al., 2001; Robbins et al., 2001). Structurally, $GABAB_{1a}$ and $GABAB_{1b}$ differ in their N-terminal ectodomain by a pair of sushi domains (SDs) that are unique to $GABAB_{1a}$ (Fig. 1; Blein et al., 2004). SDs, also known as short consensus repeats, were originally observed in proteins of the complement cascade and mediate protein interactions in a wide variety of adhesion proteins (Lehtinen et al., 2004).

Since only two structurally distinct $GABAB$ receptors with essentially identical functional and pharmacological properties in recombinant
FIGURE I Schematic representation of the GABA<sub>B(1a,2)</sub> heterodimer and its downstream effects. Native GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors are formed by the heteromerization of GABA<sub>B1</sub> and GABA<sub>B2</sub> subunits, which interact via C-terminal coiled-coil domains. Two GABA<sub>B1</sub> subunit isoforms, GABA<sub>B1a</sub> and the GABA<sub>B1b</sub>, are generated by differential promoter usage from the GABA<sub>B1</sub> gene. GABA<sub>B1a</sub> (represented in the figure) and GABA<sub>B1b</sub> differ in their N-terminal ectodomain by a pair of SDs (SD1 and SD2) that are unique to GABA<sub>B1a</sub>. Auxiliary subunits (Aux) associate as tetramers with the C-terminus of GABA<sub>B2</sub> subunit and determine the pharmacology and kinetics of the receptor response. GABA<sub>B1a</sub>-containing heteroreceptors are retained in proximity of the presynaptic release machinery via interaction of their SDs with a protein that may additionally be involved in the selective delivery of GABA<sub>B1a</sub>-containing receptor to glutamatergic terminals. The GABA<sub>B1</sub> subunit is essential for GABA binding whereas the GABA<sub>B2</sub> subunit is critical for G-protein coupling and receptor surface trafficking. The Gβγ subunits of the activated G-protein trigger inwardly rectifying Kir3 channels and inhibit voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels. The Gα subunit inhibits adenylyl cyclase (AC).
expression systems were described, it became important to clarify whether the cloned subunits account for all classical GABA<sub>B</sub> functions.

# A. GABA<sub>B1</sub> and GABA<sub>B2</sub> Subunits Are Essential for Classical GABA<sub>B</sub> Responses

Although largely overlapping, some differences in the distribution of GABA<sub>B1</sub> and GABA<sub>B2</sub> subunits were reported in various brain regions. Specifically, GABA<sub>B2</sub> mRNA was shown to be barely detectable in the caudate putamen, the medial basal hypothalamus, septum, and brainstem while GABA<sub>B1</sub> mRNA was abundant there (Clark et al., 2000). Additionally, immunohistochemical studies demonstrated that the expression of GABA<sub>B1</sub> and GABA<sub>B2</sub> protein differs in the rat striatum and in large interneurons of the human hippocampus (Billinton et al., 2000; Ng & Yung, 2001; Regard, Sato, & Coughlin, 2008). It is thus conceivable that in a neuronal context, GABA<sub>B1</sub> and GABA<sub>B2</sub> participate in distinct receptors, either alone or in association with additional proteins. Accordingly, the functions of GABA<sub>B</sub> subunits were studied in the absence of their partner subunit in GABA<sub>B1</sub>- and GABA<sub>B2</sub>-deficient mice (GABA<sup>−/−</sup><sub>B1</sub> and GABA<sup>−/−</sup><sub>B2</sub> mice). The analysis of these mice showed a significant down-regulation of GABA<sub>B2</sub> and GABA<sub>B1</sub> protein in GABA<sup>−/−</sup><sub>B1</sub> and GABA<sup>−/−</sup><sub>B2</sub> mice, respectively (Gassmann et al., 2004; Schuler et al., 2001). This suggests that GABA<sub>B1</sub> and GABA<sub>B2</sub> subunits cross-stabilize each other. In agreement with biochemical studies (Benke et al., 1999), this corroborates the predominantly heteromeric nature of native GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors. In addition, electrophysiological experiments showed that GABA<sub>B</sub>-mediated inhibition of glutamate and GABA release is lost in GABA<sup>−/−</sup><sub>B1</sub> and GABA<sup>−/−</sup><sub>B2</sub> mice (Gassmann et al., 2004; Schuler et al., 2001). Postsynaptic GABA<sub>B</sub>-mediated Kir3 currents were absent in GABA<sup>−/−</sup><sub>B1</sub> mice but atypical GABA<sub>B1</sub>-mediated responses persisted in GABA<sup>−/−</sup><sub>B2</sub> mice. In GABA<sup>−/−</sup><sub>B2</sub> mice, GABA<sub>B1</sub> mediates a G-protein-dependent inhibition of constitutively active K<sup>+</sup> channels as opposed to the normal activation of Kir3 channels (Gassmann et al., 2004). In the absence of GABA<sub>B2</sub>, GABA<sub>B1</sub> may therefore couple to different G-proteins than heteromeric GABA<sub>B(1,2)</sub> receptors. However, the existence of homomeric GABA<sub>B1</sub> receptors remains controversial since numerous *in vitro* experiments showed that GABA<sub>B2</sub> is necessary for activating the G-protein and for receptor trafficking to the cell surface (Bettler & Tiao, 2006; Couve et al., 1998; Duthey et al., 2002; Galvez et al., 2001; Havlickova et al., 2002; Margeta-Mitrovic et al., 2000, 2001; Pagano et al., 2001; Robbins et al., 2001). Therefore, it remains unclear whether atypical GABA<sub>B1</sub> responses in GABA<sup>−/−</sup><sub>B2</sub> mice are of physiological relevance or a consequence of the knockout situation. Overall, the studies with GABA<sup>−/−</sup><sub>B1</sub> and GABA<sup>−/−</sup><sub>B2</sub> mice clearly demonstrate that classical GABA<sub>B</sub> responses in the brain depend on the presence of both GABA<sub>B1</sub> and GABA<sub>B2</sub> subunits.
B. Localization and Functions of GABA<sub>B1a</sub> and GABA<sub>B1b</sub> Subunits

As outlined above, the only established molecular diversity in the GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor system is based on the GABA<sub>B1a</sub> and GABA<sub>B1b</sub> subunit isoforms that differ by a pair of SDs (Blein et al., 2004; Kaupmann et al., 1997). The two isoforms do not produce pharmacological or physiological differences in heterologous expression systems (Brauner-Osborne & Krogsgaard-Larsen, 1999; Ulrich & Bettler, 2007). The absence of isoform-specific GABA<sub>B1</sub> antibodies has prevented studying the synaptic localizations of GABA<sub>B1a</sub> and GABA<sub>B1b</sub>. Moreover, most neurons express both GABA<sub>B1</sub> isoforms, which further complicates the identification of potential physiological or pharmacological specificities. The demonstration that GABA<sub>B1a</sub> and GABA<sub>B1b</sub> contribute to distinct native GABA<sub>B</sub> functions was made possible by the generation of mice deficient in GABA<sub>B1a</sub> (GABA<sup>−/−</sup><sub>B1a</sub>) or GABA<sub>B1b</sub> (GABA<sup>−/−</sup><sub>B1b</sub>) subunits (Vigot et al., 2006). GABA<sub>B1a</sub> and GABA<sub>B1b</sub> transcripts are generated from a single GABA<sub>B1</sub> gene by differential promoter usage (Bischoff et al., 1999; Steiger et al., 2004). By individually converting the GABA<sub>B1a</sub> or GABA<sub>B1b</sub> initiation codons into stop codons using a knock-in approach, one GABA<sub>B1</sub> isoform at the time was inactivated. The resulting GABA<sup>−/−</sup><sub>B1a</sub> and GABA<sup>−/−</sup><sub>B1b</sub> mice were analyzed using pharmacological or physiological activation of GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors. Either approach led to similar conclusions regarding the localization and functions of GABA<sub>B1</sub> subunit isoforms.

I. GABA<sub>B1</sub> Isoform-Specific Functions in Response to Pharmacological Activation

Using GABA<sup>−/−</sup><sub>B1a</sub> and GABA<sup>−/−</sup><sub>B1b</sub> mice, Vigot and colleagues showed that GABA<sub>B1a</sub> and GABA<sub>B1b</sub> mediate distinct functions as a result of their distinct localization within neurons (Vigot et al., 2006). At the Schaffer collateral to CA1 pyramidal neuron synapse, GABA<sub>B1a</sub> was predominantly localized at glutamatergic terminals. In contrast, GABA<sub>B1b</sub> was mostly localized in dendritic spines juxtaposed to glutamate release sites. The axonal versus dendritic distribution of GABA<sub>B1a</sub> and GABA<sub>B1b</sub> subunits was also studied in transfected organotypic hippocampal slice cultures and cultured hippocampal neurons (Guetg et al., 2009; Vigot et al., 2006). This confirmed the predominant localization of GABA<sub>B1a</sub> at glutamatergic terminals. In addition, these experiments revealed that both GABA<sub>B1a</sub> and GABA<sub>B1b</sub> are expressed in the dendrites but that only GABA<sub>B1b</sub> efficiently enters spine heads. These observations were further supported by whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from CA1 pyramidal neurons. Stimulation of the Schaffer collateral-commissural fibers generates EPSCs in the pyramidal cells. The amplitude of these EPSCs is reduced after activation of GABA<sub>B</sub> heteroreceptors due to the ensuing inhibition of glutamate release (Schuler et al.,

2001). Vigot and colleagues (2006) showed that this EPSC amplitude reduction is impaired in $GABA_{B1a}^{-/-}$ mice, implicating $GABA_{B1a}$-containing receptors in heteroreceptor function. Vigot and colleagues also recorded IPSCs in pyramidal cells to address which isoform(s) serve(s) as autoreceptors. Baclofen reduced IPSC amplitude to a similar extent in $GABA_{B1a}^{-/-}$ and $GABA_{B1b}^{-/-}$ mice, which supports that $GABA_{B1a}$ as well as $GABA_{B1b}$ subunits assemble into autoreceptors. Finally, the contribution of $GABA_{B1}$ subunit isoforms to postsynaptic inhibition was addressed by recording Kir3 currents. The amplitudes of $K^+$ currents in response to baclofen application were normal in wild-type and $GABA_{B1a}^{-/-}$ mice. However, baclofen-induced currents were reduced in $GABA_{B1b}^{-/-}$ mice suggesting that the principal isoform mediating postsynaptic inhibition in CA1 neurons is $GABA_{B1b}$.

Postsynaptic $GABA_B$ receptors and $GABA_B$ autoreceptors were shown to restrict and promote LTP, respectively (Davies & Collingridge, 1996; Davies et al., 1991). Vigot and colleagues (2006) studied LTP at the CA3–CA1 synapse of $GABA_{B1a}^{-/-}$ and $GABA_{B1b}^{-/-}$ mice. While LTP was normal in $GABA_{B1b}^{-/-}$ mice, LTP was clearly impaired in $GABA_{B1a}^{-/-}$ mice. This LTP deficit was also reflected in hippocampus-dependent memory tasks where $GABA_{B1a}^{-/-}$ mice exhibited a decreased performance in the recognition of known versus novel objects. Of note, $GABA_{B1}^{-/-}$ mice with no $GABA_B$ subunits at all did not exhibit any LTP either. However, acute blockade of $GABA_B$ receptors with an antagonist was not sufficient to prevent the induction of LTP, suggesting that the constitutive absence of $GABA_{B1a}$ receptors in $GABA_{B1a}^{-/-}$ mice triggers adaptive changes that prevent LTP. To clarify this issue, the paired-pulse ratio of evoked EPSCs and the miniature excitatory postsynaptic current (mEPSC) amplitude and frequency were monitored in $GABA_{B1a}^{-/-}$ mice. While no differences were observed in the paired-pulse ratio and mEPSC amplitude, there was a significant increase in the mEPSC frequency. The increase in mEPSC frequency was likely caused by an increase in the number of functional synapses. In support of this, $GABA_{B1a}^{-/-}$ mice exhibited an increased coefficient of variation of the AMPA receptor component of EPSCs ($CV_{AMPA}$) while the $CV_{NMDA}$ remained normal, suggesting an unmasking of silent synapses by insertion of AMPA receptors (Kullmann, 1994). This not only reveals a compensatory mechanism by which the absence of the $GABA_{B1a}$ isoform leads to altered synaptic functions but also demonstrates a role for $GABA_B$ heteroreceptors in synaptic plasticity processes. In conclusion, it appears that heteroreceptor activation by spillover of GABA is important to prevent loss of silent synapses and saturation of LTP (Vigot et al., 2006). As discussed below, the lack of $GABA_{B1a}$ at glutamatergic terminals also strongly influences LTP processes in the amygdala (Shaban et al., 2006).

In addition to data from CA3 to CA1 pyramidal neuron synapses, a prevalence of the $GABA_{B1a}$ isoform at glutamatergic terminals was also observed at other synapses. Ulrich and colleagues showed that at the

corticothalamic fibers to thalamocortical relay synapse, glutamate release is exclusively controlled by GABA${}_{\mathrm{B}1 \mathrm{a}}$-containing receptors (Ulrich et al., 2007). They also showed that both GABA${}_{\mathrm{B}1 \mathrm{a}}$ and GABA${}_{\mathrm{B}1 \mathrm{b}}$ are expressed at postsynaptic sites and at GABAergic terminals. Likewise, baclofen reduced glutamate release in GABA${}_{\mathrm{B}1 \mathrm{b}}^{-/-}$ but not in GABA${}_{\mathrm{B}1 \mathrm{a}}^{-/-}$ mice at mossy fiber (MF)–CA3 pyramidal neuron synapses and at cortical afferents projecting to the amygdala (Guetg et al., 2009; Shaban et al., 2006). This supports that the selective association of GABA${}_{\mathrm{B}1 \mathrm{a}}$ with glutamatergic terminals is a feature that is conserved at most synapses.

## GABA${}_{\mathrm{B}1}$ Isoform-Specific Functions in Response to Physiological Activation

The aforementioned studies on GABA${}_{\mathrm{B}1}$ isoform-specific functions all used pharmacological activation of GABA${}_{\mathrm{B}}$ receptors. Isoform-specific functions were also observed under conditions of physiological receptor activation. Pérez-Garci and colleagues (2006) studied GABA${}_{\mathrm{B}}$ receptors at synaptic inputs on layer 5 neocortical pyramidal cells using a physiological paradigm. L5 pyramidal cells extend their dendritic tufts to layer L1 where they receive excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs from converging L1 fibers and from several classes of interneurons (Hestrin & Armstrong, 1996; Perez-Garci et al., 2006). Excitatory synaptic inputs often occur hundreds of microns away from the site of action potential (AP) generation in the axon initial segment (Radnikow et al., 2002; Somogyi et al., 1998). Therefore, the excitatory signals transmitted by these remote inputs contribute little to the generation of APs (Stuart et al., 1997). It was suggested that these inputs instead modulate the generation of Na${}^{+}$/Ca${}^{2+}$ APs or Ca${}^{2+}$ spikes in the dendritic tree (Larkum et al., 1999). Inhibitory inputs to the apical tufts produce a long-lasting inhibition of dendritic Ca${}^{2+}$ spikes (Larkum et al., 1999). Perez-Garci et al. (2006) studied the contribution of GABA${}_{\mathrm{B}1}$ subunit isoforms to the inhibition of Ca${}^{2+}$ spikes induced by extracellular stimulation in L1. Using the mice developed by Vigot et al. (2006), they showed that selectively GABA${}_{\mathrm{B}1 \mathrm{b}}$ is involved in Ca${}^{2+}$-spike inhibition. Moreover, they showed that this inhibition was caused by a GABA${}_{\mathrm{B}}$-mediated down-regulation of dendritic Ca${}^{2+}$ channel activity and not by hyperpolarization through Kir3 channels. Interestingly, Pérez-Garci et al. (2006) also showed that physiological activation of GABA${}_{\mathrm{B}1 \mathrm{a}}$ autoreceptors inhibits GABA release. This clearly demonstrates that synaptically released GABA controls a number of physiological functions by activating GABA${}_{\mathrm{B}}$ receptors assembled from specific GABA${}_{\mathrm{B}1}$ isoforms.

Physiological activation of GABA${}_{\mathrm{B}}$ heteroreceptors at glutamatergic terminals was studied at hippocampal MF–CA3 pyramidal neuron synapses. Heterosynaptic depression at this synapse relies on the activation
of heteroreceptors by synaptically released GABA (Chandler et al., 2003; Isaacson et al., 1993; Vogt & Nicoll, 1999). Using $G A B A_{B 1 a}^{-/-}$ and $G A B A_{B 1 b}^{-/-}$ mice, Guetg and colleagues (2009) showed that $G A B A_{B 1 a}$ is more abundant than $G A B A_{B 1 b}$ at MF terminals, consistent with findings at other glutamater- gic terminals (Ulrich & Bettler, 2007). Heterosynaptic depression in response to endogenously released GABA was absent in $G A B A_{B 1 a}^{-/-}$ mice, demonstrating that under physiological conditions only $G A B A_{B 1 a}$-containing receptors assume heteroreceptor function.

Yet, another study reinforces the notion that selectively the $G A B A_{B 1 a}$ isoform is involved in the physiological control of glutamate release. Projection neurons of the LA, which are important for classical fear conditioning, receive convergent inputs from thalamic and cortical sensory afferents (LeDoux, 2000; Rumpel et al., 2005). Coincident stimulation of both thalamic and cortical afferents induces LTP at cortical afferents through a presynaptic NMDA receptor-dependent mechanism (Humeau et al., 2003). Conversely, a tetanic stimulation of the cortical afferents alone only induces LTP at cortical afferents when $G A B A_{B}$ receptors are antagonized (Shaban et al., 2006). This form of LTP is expressed presynaptically and is associated with a decrease in the paired-pulse ratio (Shaban et al., 2006). Considering the strong modulation of LA synaptic activity by local GABAergic inhibition (Bissiere et al., 2003; Li et al., 1996; Sugita et al., 1993), this suggests an involvement of presynaptic $G A B A_{B}$ heteroreceptors. Activation of $G A B A_{B}$ heteroreceptors on cortical afferents may explain the failure to induce LTP by the unique stimulation of cortical afferents. Indeed, induction of LTP was possible in $G A B A_{B 1 a}^{-/-}$ mice lacking heteroreceptors (Shaban et al., 2006). In contrast, the $G A B A_{B 1 b}$ subunit was responsible for postsynaptic inhibition. At thalamic afferents to projection neurons LTP is induced and expressed postsynaptically and therefore facilitated in $G A B A_{B 1 b}^{-/-}$ mice. This study reinforces that $G A B A_{B 1 a}$ and $G A B A_{B 1 b}$ regulate pre- and postsynaptic inhi- bition, respectively. In further support of this, ultrastructural studies show that $G A B A_{B 1 a}$ is predominantly localized at glutamatergic terminals while $G A B A_{B 1 b}$ is most abundant in the dendritic spines of projection neurons. The behavioral consequence of a selective loss of $G A B A_{B 1 a}$ heteroreceptors in the LA is a generalization of conditioned fear to unconditioned stimuli. Presumably, the lack of $G A B A_{B}$ heteroreceptors in $G A B A_{B 1 a}^{-/-}$ mice allows LTP induction at the cortical afferent in the absence of coincident thalamic afferent activity, thus inappropriately potentiating synaptic inputs and lead- ing to a generalization of fear (Shaban et al., 2006).

The studies mentioned above shed light on specific functions of $G A B A_{B 1}$ isoforms. They also reveal that these specific functions are a consequence of a differential distribution of $G A B A_{B 1}$ isoforms to axonal and dendritic sites. Most interestingly, the available data also highlight similarities in the distri- bution of $G A B A_{B 1}$ isoforms at different synapses. In Fig. 2, we summarize the distribution of $G A B A_{B}$ isoforms at glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses.

FIGURE 2 Distribution of GABA<sub>B₁</sub> subunit isoforms to neuronal compartments. Schematic of a glutamatergic terminal contacting a dendritic spine and a GABAergic terminal contacting the dendritic shaft. GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors are localized presynaptically on glutamate and GABA terminals and postsynaptically on dendritic shafts and spines. Presynaptic GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors prevent neurotransmitter release by inhibiting voltage-sensitive Ca²⁺ channels. Specifically, GABA<sub>B</sub> autoreceptors inhibit the release of GABA whereas GABA<sub>B</sub> heteroreceptors inhibit the release of other neurotransmitters such as glutamate. Postsynaptic GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors mediate slow IPSPs by activating Kir3 channels and inhibit voltage-sensitive Ca²⁺ channels. GABA<sub>B₁a</sub> assumes heteroreceptor function at glutamatergic terminals. These heteroreceptors are activated by GABA spillover from neighboring inhibitory terminals. Both GABA<sub>B₁a</sub> and GABA<sub>B₁b</sub> assume autoreceptor function at inhibitory terminals impinging on CA1 pyramidal and amygdala neurons. However, only GABA<sub>B₁a</sub> assumes autoreceptor function at inhibitory terminals contacting the apical tufts of L5 cortical neurons. Dendritic GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors coupled to Kir3 channels of CA1 neurons mostly contain GABA<sub>B₁b</sub>. Dendritic GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors that inhibit dendritic Ca²⁺ channels at the apical tufts of L5 cortical neurons exclusively contain GABA<sub>B₁b</sub>. GABA<sub>B₁a</sub> and GABA<sub>B₁b</sub> are present in the spine neck and in dendritic shafts but only GABA<sub>B₁b</sub> enters spine heads.

## Mechanisms Involved in the Selective Axonal Targeting of GABA<sub>B₁a</sub>

The prevalence of GABA<sub>B₁a</sub> at glutamatergic terminals is interesting from a trafficking point of view. GABA<sub>B₁a</sub> and GABA<sub>B₁b</sub> differ by a pair of SDs that is selectively present in GABA<sub>B₁a</sub> (Blein et al., 2004). It is

therefore reasonable to speculate that these SDs are involved in protein interactions that are required for trafficking and/or retention of GABA<sub>B1a</sub> at glutamatergic terminals. The role of the SDs in axonal targeting was studied using cultured hippocampal neurons as an experimental system (Biermann et al., 2010). Mutation of cysteines into serines in the SDs precludes axonal localization of GABA<sub>B1a</sub>, presumably by impairing binding of the SDs to an axonally destined protein. Fusion of SDs to uniformly (CD8) or somatodendritically (mGluR1a) localized proteins redirects these proteins to the axon. Interestingly, surface expression of GABA<sub>B1a</sub> is not mandatory for axonal delivery. This suggests that GABA<sub>B1a</sub> reaches the terminal via intracellular vesicles rather than via lateral diffusion at the cell surface. A model explaining axonal targeting of GABA<sub>B1a</sub> was proposed. In this model both the GABA<sub>B1a</sub> and GABA<sub>B1b</sub> isoforms are targeted to the dendrites via C-terminal targeting signal(s) present in GABA<sub>B1</sub> and/or GABA<sub>B2</sub>. A subpopulation of GABA<sub>B1a</sub> is then redistributed to the axonal compartment via the association of the SDs with axonally destined proteins. In support of this, the SDs of GABA<sub>B1a</sub> recognize binding sites in neuronal membrane preparations with low nanomolar affinity (Tiao et al., 2008). However, the specific binding partners remain to be identified. The expression level of these SD-binding partners potentially modulates axonal expression of GABA<sub>B1a</sub> and thus presynaptic GABA<sub>B</sub>-mediated inhibition. Interestingly, the GABA<sub>B1a</sub> and GABA<sub>B1b</sub> subunits are themselves independently regulated at the transcriptional level (Steiger et al., 2004). This allows for an isoform-specific adjustment of GABA<sub>B1</sub> levels in axons and dendrites. The differential distribution of GABA<sub>B1</sub> isoforms to axonal and dendritic compartments exposes them to effector systems with distinct thresholds of activation, which may underlie some of the differences in agonist potencies that were observed with native GABA<sub>B</sub> responses.

## V. Additional Mechanisms of Diversity

Pharmacological and kinetic differences between native GABA<sub>B</sub> responses may additionally arise from proteins influencing receptor properties, the G-protein cycle, or the effector system. GPCRs are commonly modulated via phosphorylation of their intracellular domains resulting in a decrease in receptor to effector coupling and/or a reduction of surface expression (Tobin et al., 2008; Tsao & von Zastrow, 2000). Desensitization of GPCRs is primarily mediated by G-protein kinases (GRKs) and arrestins. According to the prevailing model for desensitization, GRK phosphorylation of the agonist-bound receptor recruits arrestins, which precludes coupling to the G-protein and leads to receptor internalization (Ferguson et al., 1996). Little is known about modulation of GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors by phosphorylation. However, the available data tend to disagree with the generally accepted
model predicting that phosphorylation increases receptor desensitization. While it was proposed that GRK4 promotes agonist-dependent desensitization of GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors the mechanism surprisingly does not involve phosphorylation (Perroy et al., 2003). Other kinases were also proposed to modulate GABA<sub>B</sub> responses. Couve and collaborators showed that protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent phosphorylation of serine 862 in the cytoplasmic tail of GABA<sub>B2</sub> alleviates GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor desensitization, in clear contrast to the generally accepted view that phosphorylation leads to internalization of GPCRs (Couve et al., 2002). The mechanisms responsible for reducing GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor desensitization upon serine 862 phosphorylation involve increased receptor stability at the cell surface (Couve et al., 2002; Fairfax et al., 2004). Similarly, it was shown that AMP kinase directly binds to GABA<sub>B1</sub> and phosphorylates serine 783 in the cytoplasmic tail of GABA<sub>B2</sub> to enhance Kir3 channel coupling (Kuramoto et al., 2007). GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor phosphorylation therefore appears to influence desensitization and effector coupling, which additionally may explain some of the kinetic and pharmacological differences observed with native GABA<sub>B</sub> responses.

Regulators of G-protein signaling (RGS) are members of a multifunctional family of GTPase-accelerating proteins (GAPs) promoting GTP hydrolysis and hence accelerating termination of Gβγ signaling at effectors. This influences the EC<sub>50</sub> of agonist-mediated responses (Shea & Linderman, 1997). RGS proteins comprise a large family of proteins, including RGS2, a modulator of Kir3 channel coupling (Doupnik et al., 2004). Accordingly, RGS proteins were shown to increase GABA<sub>B</sub>-mediated desensitization of the Kir3.2 channel response in transfected HEK293 cells (Mutneja et al., 2005). GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors on DA and GABAergic neurons in the VTA couple to Kir3 channels with low and high efficacy, respectively (Cruz et al., 2004). According to Labouebe and colleagues, a selective expression of RGS2 in DA neurons is partly responsible for the low coupling efficiency (Labouebe et al., 2007). They showed that RGS2 inactivation increases GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor to Kir3 channel coupling in DA neurons, monitored as a decrease in the EC<sub>50</sub> for baclofen activation. Hence, the presence of RGS2 in DA neurons restrains G-protein activation of the Kir3 channels. Interestingly, they further showed that the drug of abuse GHB increases the coupling efficiency in DA neurons by inhibiting RGS2 transcription (Labouebe et al., 2007). Yet, the low coupling efficiency observed in DA neurons was also explained by the subunit composition of Kir3 channels. Four different Kir3 (Kir3.1–3.4) subunits assemble to form functional homo- or heteromeric channels. Using single-cell RT PCR, it was shown that DA neurons exclusively express heteromeric Kir3.2/3.3 channels while GABAergic neurons also express Kir3.1, thus enabling the formation of Kir3.1/3.2 and Kir3.1/3.3 channels. Apparently, Kir3.1/3.2 and Kir3.1/3.3 channels are responsible for the higher coupling efficiency of GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors in GABAergic neurons (Cruz et al., 2004). Noteworthy, modulation of the coupling efficiency by
RGS2 is unique to Kir3.2/3.3 channels (Labouebe et al., 2007) further explaining the lower coupling efficiency in the DA neurons. Contribution of RGS proteins to GABA<sub>B</sub> signaling was also investigated using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), which revealed interactions between RGS4 and GABA<sub>B1</sub> or GABA<sub>B2</sub> (Fowler et al., 2007). In addition to GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors coupling to distinct channel subtypes, the extent of receptor–effector colocalization may also influence agonist potency (Koyrakh et al., 2005; Ulrich & Bettler, 2007). Pharmacological and functional diversity of native GABA<sub>B</sub> responses may therefore arise from direct receptor modifications, differences in effector coupling, as well as effector diversity.

A proteomic analysis was performed to test the hypothesis that functional diversity of native GABA<sub>B</sub> responses results from yet unknown subunits (Schwenk et al., 2010). Antibodies against GABA<sub>B1</sub> and GABA<sub>B2</sub> were used to affinity-purify receptor complexes from native tissue. The constituents of these complexes were then identified by high-resolution nanoflow liquid-chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. This revealed the existence of four sequence-related cytosolic proteins that bind as tetramers to the C-terminal domain of the GABA<sub>B2</sub> subunit (Fig. 1). These proteins exhibit distinct but overlapping distribution patterns in the brain. Expression of these proteins in heterologous cells or hippocampal neurons revealed that they determine both the pharmacology and the kinetics of the receptor response. Specifically, these proteins alter agonist potency, onset, and desensitization of the GABA<sub>B</sub> response. Most if not all GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors in the brain are associated with these proteins. Since these proteins tightly bind to the receptor and alter its kinetic and pharmacological properties, they qualify as auxiliary subunits of GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors. The data are most consistent with native GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors minimally forming dimeric assemblies of units composed of GABA<sub>B1</sub>, GABA<sub>B2</sub>, and a tetramer of auxiliary subunits. This represents a substantial departure from current structural concepts for GPCRs. Much of the heterogeneity observed with native GABA<sub>B</sub> responses may relate to these auxiliary subunits. Importantly, the association of the core GABA<sub>B(1,2)</sub> subunits with distinct auxiliary subunit combinations is expected to further expand the functional and pharmacological repertoire of GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors.

## VI. Conclusions

Cloning of GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors in 1997/98 identified two GABA<sub>B(1a,2)</sub> and GABA<sub>B(1b,2)</sub> receptors with essentially indistinguishable properties in recombinant expression systems. However, a significant body of literature supports that native GABA<sub>B</sub> responses differ in their pharmacological and kinetic properties. It is emerging that some of these differences relate to a differential distribution of GABA<sub>B(1a,2)</sub> and GABA<sub>B(1b,2)</sub> receptors to

axonal and dendritic compartments, which will expose them to effectors with distinct coupling efficiencies. This coupling may further be influenced by receptor phosphorylation, proteins that influence the G-protein cycle and effector diversity. An exciting new development in the field is the discovery of a family of auxiliary subunits that tightly associate with the core GABA<sub>B(1a,2)</sub> and GABA<sub>B(1b,2)</sub> receptors and markedly alter their G-protein signaling. It is expected that these auxiliary subunits are responsible for much of the observed heterogeneity of native GABA<sub>B</sub> responses. The existence of auxiliary GABA<sub>B</sub> subunits imparting distinct pharmacological and kinetic properties to the receptor will hopefully spark drug discovery efforts aiming at a more selective therapeutic interference with the GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor system.
