CO-INHIBITORY MOLECULES  
OF THE B7–CD28 FAMILY IN THE  
CONTROL OF T-CELL IMMUNITY  

Lieping Chen  

Co-signalling molecules are cell-surface glycoproteins that can direct, modulate  
and fine-tune T-cell receptor (TCR) signals. On the basis of their functional outcome,  
co-signalling molecules can be divided into co-stimulators and co-inhibitors, which  
promote or suppress T-cell activation, respectively. By expression at the appropriate  
time and location, co-signalling molecules positively and negatively control the priming,  
growth, differentiation and functional maturation of a T-cell response. We are now beginning  
to understand the power of co-inhibitors in the context of lymphocyte homeostasis and  
the pathogenesis of human diseases. In this article, I focus on several newly described  
co-inhibitory pathways in the B7–CD28 family.

IMMUNOLOGICAL SYNAPSE  
A structure that is formed at  
the cell surface between a T cell  
and an antigen-presenting cell;  
also known as the supra-  
molecular activation cluster  
(SMAC). Important molecules  
involved in T-cell activation —  
including the T-cell receptor,  
numerous signal transduction  
molecules and molecular  
adaptors — accumulate at  
this site. Mobilization of the  
actin cytoskeleton of the cell  
is required for immunological-  
synapse formation.

Co-signalling molecules are essential for the commu-  
nication of a T cell with virtually all other host cells.  
During cell–cell contact, specific recognition occurs  
between co-signalling molecules and triggers bio-  
chemical signalling, which leads to cascades of tran-  
scription and expression of downstream genes.  
Therefore, co-signalling molecules are among the ear-  
liest responding elements of the immune system to  
antigens. A hallmark of co-signalling molecules is that  
their functions are entirely dependent on T-cell recep-  
tor (TCR) signals¹, and the role of co-signalling mole-  
cules is to control the TCR signal. In the absence of  
sufficient TCR signalling, co-signalling molecules lose  
their function or function aberrantly².  

Most co-signalling molecules are members of the  
immunoglobulin and tumour-necrosis factor (TNF)  
superfamilies, and many of them are identified as crucial  
components of the IMMUNOLOGICAL SYNAPSE. On the basis of  
their functional outcome, co-signalling molecules can  
be further categorized as CO-STIMULATORS or positive co-  
stimulatory molecules that enhance TCR-mediated  
responses, and CO-INHIBITORS or negative co-stimulatory  
molecules that inhibit TCR-mediated responses (TABLE 1).  
Traditionally, co-signalling molecules are also termed as  

receptors or ligands to distinguish the direction of signal  
transmission. However, this nomenclature is entirely  
operational and does not reflect the intrinsic nature of  
these molecules. For example, a ligand could be a co-  
stimulator and a co-inhibitor, depending on the specific  
receptors it meets. After binding to CD28, CD80/CD86  
are co-stimulatory for T-cell responses, but they can act as  
co-inhibitors by interacting with cytotoxic T lymphocyte  
antigen 4 (CTLA4). Moreover, a ligand could become a  
receptor if it receives a co-inhibitory or co-stimulatory  
signal. This REVERSE SIGNALLING event has been described  
for B7-H1 and CD80/CD86 (see later), and might be  
important as a feedback mechanism for the regulation  
of T cell–antigen-presenting cell (APC) interactions as  
part of the co-signalling network.  

Although co-stimulators have been well studied¹,³,⁴,  
we are only just beginning to understand the roles of  
co-inhibitors, particularly in the past five years. In  
this article, I focus on the B7 family co-inhibitory  
pathways as examples of this negative regulatory  
mechanism. These pathways include CD80/CD86–  
CTLA4, as well as B7-H1/B7-DC–PD1 (programmed cell  
death 1), and B7-H4 and BTLA (B and T lymphocyte  
attenuator) (FIG. 1).

The co-signalling network model

A popular model to explain the requirement of co-signals in T-cell activation is the two-signal hypothesis<sup>5</sup>. In this model, signal one is derived from the TCR after triggering by antigenic peptide presented by MHC molecules and signal two is delivered through co-stimulation (FIG. 2a). Integration of the two signals induces optimal activation of T cells. Lack of a co-stimulatory signal leads to decreased responses and, in some cases, even induces tolerance or anergy (an unresponsive status of T cells to antigens). This two-signal model or ‘missing signal model’, however, has been recently challenged by the discovery of new co-inhibitory pathways and their crucial roles in the control of T-cell activation. The co-inhibitors described so far function in at least three distinct co-signalling pathways: the CD80/CD86– CTLA4 axis, the B7-H1/B7-DC–PD1 axis, and B7-H4 and BTLA. The molecules in these pathways, their expression pattern and the phenotypes of mice with individual gene deficiencies are summarized in TABLE 2. Current experimental results support the idea that the TCR signal is required for the induction of activation and tolerance/anergy<sup>1,6</sup>. Co-stimulators and co-inhibitors have an essential role in these responses (FIG. 2b). Here, I propose a co-signalling network model to integrate these new findings. The central theme of this model is that the TCR signal does not decide or govern the direction of a T-cell response and that the outcome of an antigen-specific T-cell response is guided by co-stimulators and/or co-inhibitors, which are often simultaneously provided to T cells by APCs and other host cells. Although in vitro studies indicate that these co-inhibitors seem to have overlapping functions, each pathway has preferential control of one or more stages of T-cell activation, including priming, differentiation and maturation of effector cells and potentially memory responses (FIG. 3).

CO-STIMULATORS

Molecules that stimulate naive or activated T cells in the presence of a T-cell receptor signal by binding to a co-stimulatory receptor, leading to the induction of T-cell growth, differentiation and functional maturation.

CO-INHIBITORS

Molecules that inhibit T-cell responses by binding co-inhibitory receptors only in the presence of a T-cell receptor signal. This can inhibit T-cell growth and functional maturation, and induce tolerance/anergy of T cells.

REVERSE SIGNALLING

In some cases, a ligand can receive a signal from its counter-receptor, so that the ligand could function as a typical receptor.

The CD80/CD86–CTLA4 axis

CTLA4 as a co-inhibitor. CD80 and CD86, and their receptors CD28 and CTLA4, constitute the most extensively studied co-signalling pathway. Although

CD28 provides a strong co-stimulatory signal for naive T cells after ligation with CD80/CD86, ample evidence supports an inhibitory function for CTLA4 in both spontaneous autoimmunity and ongoing T-cell responses. Ctl4-deficient mice spontaneously develop lymphoproliferative disorders accompanied by lethal infiltration of many organs with polyclonal T cells<sup>7,8</sup>. Autoimmune responses in Ctl4-knockout mice depend on CD28, because further introduction of CD28 deficiency eliminates lethal lymphoproliferative diseases<sup>9</sup>. These results indicate that CD28 co-stimulation is actively suppressed by CTLA4 signalling. Additional evidence for the inhibitory function of CTLA4 includes the enhancement of T-cell responses against foreign and self-antigens by monoclonal antibodies that block the interaction between CTLA4 and CD80/CD86 (REF. 10). Despite the fact that the affinity of the interaction of CD80/CD86 with CTLA4 is at least one log higher than their interaction with CD28, the co-stimulatory function of CD80/CD86 often dominates in vitro and in vivo<sup>4,10</sup>. In addition, blockade of CD80 and/or CD86 by monoclonal antibodies or elimination of these ligands by targeted disruption often leads to inhibited and not enhanced immune responses<sup>4,10</sup>. These observations could be interpreted in terms of differential expression of CD28 and CTLA4, because CD28 is constitutively expressed by T cells, whereas CTLA4 is only found at a low level on naive T cells, but is rapidly induced after activation<sup>4,10</sup>. Therefore, in contrast to the main role of PD1 as a co-inhibitor in the effector phase of T cells (see later), the inhibitory functions of CTLA4 seem to occur mainly during the late stages of T-cell priming (FIG. 3). Under certain circumstances, the inhibitory functions of CD80/CD86 can become dominant even in the presence of CD28. For example, iris pigment-epithelial cells express CD86 and inhibit T-cell activation after binding to CTLA4 (REF. 11). Dendritic cells (DCs) that lack CD80/CD86 expression have increased stimulatory capacity for interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) production<sup>12</sup>. A recent study indicates that

transfer of CD80/CD86-deficient T cells enhances GRAFT-VERSUS-HOST DISEASE (GVHD), whereas transfer of CD86-transgenic T cells inhibits GVHD, presumably by enhanced interaction with CTLA4 (REF. 13). Collectively, the expression of CD80/CD86 by various types of cell could potentially interact with CTLA4 to suppress T-cell responses.

**Mechanistic aspects of CTLA4-mediated co-inhibition.** The mechanisms of CTLA4-mediated inhibition of T-cell responses are not yet elucidated. Ligation of CTLA4 is found to induce peripheral T-cell tolerance/anergy ${ }^{14,15}$,

and blockade of CTLA4 by monoclonal antibodies prevents T-cell anergy in some systems ${ }^{16}$, but not in others ${ }^{17}$. Other mechanisms include the inhibition of cell-cycle progression ${ }^{4}$ and the induction of immunosuppressive transforming growth factor-$\beta^{18,19}$. CTLA4 is found in lipid rafts and could be recruited into the immunological synapse ${ }^{20-22}$, where it might compete for ligand binding with CD28. A direct interaction of CTLA4 with TCR-$\zeta$ chain has been reported ${ }^{23,24}$. Therefore, CTLA4 might directly control TCR accumulation and retention in the immunological synapse. The role of CTLA4 in the activation of regulatory T ($T_{\text {Reg }}$) cells might also contribute to tolerance induction. $C D 4^{+} C D 25^{+} T_{\text {Reg }}$ cells express high levels of CTLA4 (REFS 25–27) and antagonist CTLA4-specific antibody abrogates $T_{\text {Reg }}$-cell functions ${ }^{26,27}$.

**Reverse signalling of CD80/CD86 in CTLA4-mediated co-inhibition.** Decoy CTLA4 receptor (CTLA4-immunoglobulin fusion protein) has been extensively tested in experimental models and in clinical trials for its immunosuppressive functions ${ }^{4,28-30}$. It was believed that the effect is due to blockade of the interaction between CD80/CD86 and CD28. Two recent studies provide a new explanation and highlight the importance of CD80/CD86 reverse signalling ${ }^{31,32}$. In these experiments, the CTLA4–immunoglobulin interaction with DC-associated CD80/CD86 induces tryptophan catabolism by upregulating the expression of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) by DCs, which subsequently inhibits T-cell responses ${ }^{31}$. The observed effect could be due to depletion of the essential amino acid tryptophan, leading to inhibition of T-cell growth ${ }^{33}$, and/or apoptosis of T cells induced by tryptophan catabolites ${ }^{34}$. In this regard, CTLA4 on $T_{\text {Reg }}$ cells has also been shown to initiate tryptophan catabolism and inhibit DC function ${ }^{32}$. These data support a role for reverse signalling of DC-associated CD80 and/or CD86 by CTLA4 in the inhibition of T-cell immune responses. Therefore, in addition to blocking CD28 signalling, CTLA4–immunoglobulin might be actively involved in the downregulation of DC activity (FIG. 4).

Taken together, these results indicate that CTLA4 controls T-cell responses at two levels. First, CTLA4 is essential for suppressing spontaneous autoimmunity against self-antigens, which usually engage low affinity/avidity TCRs. Second, CTLA4 also inhibits primed/activated T cells specific for foreign antigens. Although the mechanisms of such inhibition are not yet fully understood, CTLA4 is a promising target for manipulation of autoimmune responses and potentially for cancer immunotherapy.

**The B7-H1/B7-DC-PD1 axis**

**PD1 as a co-inhibitor.** PD1 was originally identified from a T-cell hybridoma undergoing programmed cell death ${ }^{35}$ and was detected on activated, but not resting, T and B cells ${ }^{36}$. Accumulating experimental evidence indicates that PD1 is a co-inhibitor in the regulation of T- and B-cell responses. Pd1-deficient mice on the

Figure 1 | **The B7–CD28-family molecules with co-inhibitory functions.**  
a | Five B7-family molecules have been identified so far to have co-inhibitory function: CD80, CD86, B7-H1, B7-DC and B7-H4. All molecules have an immunoglobulin variable (IgV)-like domain and an immunoglobulin constant (IgG)-like domain in the extracellular portion, a transmembrane region and a cytoplasmic region. There are no obvious functional regions/motifs identified so far in their cytoplasmic regions. B7-H3 is another potential co-inhibitor in this family, which exists in two forms — 2lgB7-H3 and 4lgB7-H3.  
b | All three CD28-like molecules with co-inhibitory function — cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA4), programmed cell death 1 (PD1) and B and T lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA) — have a single IgV-like extracellular region, a transmembrane region and a cytoplasmic region. In CTLA4, a Tyr-Xaa-Xaa-Met motif (Gly-Val-Tyr-Val-Lys-Met) in the cytoplasmic region with inhibitory function has been identified ${ }^{97}$. In the cytoplasmic region of PD1, an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM) and an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based switch motif (ITSM) have been identified with potential capacity to interact with SRC homology 2 (SH2)-domain-containing phosphatases such as SHIPs ${ }^{45-47}$. BTLA has two ITIMs ${ }^{80}$.
C57BL/6 background slowly, but spontaneously, develop a lupus-like proliferative arthritis and glomerulonephritis with IgG<sub>3</sub> deposition<sup>37</sup>. In addition, Pd1-deficient mice on the BALB/c background develop autoimmune dilated cardiomyopathy with severely impaired heart contraction and sudden death by congestive heart failure<sup>38</sup>. Affected hearts have deposits of IgG on the surface of cardiomyocytes, and the affected Pd1-deficient mice have a high serum titre of an IgG autoantibody specific for cardiac troponin I protein<sup>38,39</sup>. Therefore, Pd1-deficient mice seem to have a similar

phenotype to Ctl4-knockout mice, although disease severity and the tissues involved in autoimmunity are different. In addition to autoimmune responses, PD1 is also shown to be co-inhibitory for foreign-antigen-induced T-cell responses. Antagonist PD1-specific antibodies were found to accelerate experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), autoimmune diabetes, GVHD and hapten-induced contact hypersensitivity in mouse models<sup>40–43</sup>. Furthermore, Pd1-deficient mice mount more vigorous T-cell responses to adenovirus-mediated liver infection than normal mice<sup>44</sup>. The intracellular domain of PD1 contains an IMMUNORECEPTOR TYROSINE-BASED INHIBITORY MOTIF (ITIM) and an IMMUNORECEPTOR TYROSINE-BASED SWITCH MOTIF (ITSM)<sup>45,46</sup> and it has been suggested that PD1 could inhibit T- and B-cell functions by recruiting the intracellular phosphatase SHP2 (SRC homology 2 (SH2)-domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase 2), which dephosphorylates and deactivates downstream signal transducers<sup>47,48</sup>. The role of PD1 in thymocyte development is much less studied, but several reports indicate that PD1 might be involved in the regulation of thymocyte NEGATIVE SELECTION<sup>49</sup>. Therefore, overwhelming data support the idea that PD1 delivers a negative signal to T and B cells and might be involved in the maintenance of self-tolerance in the periphery.

**Dichotomy of B7-H1 and B7-DC functions.** B7-H1 and B7-DC are two independent ligands that bind PD1 (REFS 48,50). B7-H1 was originally identified by a combination of molecular cloning and human EXPRESSED-SEQUENCE TAG DATABASE searching based on homology to CD80/CD86 (REF.51). In contrast to the limited expression of CD80/CD86 by haematopoietic cells, B7-H1 messenger RNA could be found in various human tissues. However, abundant B7-H1 mRNA distribution does not correlate with its protein expression. In fact, cell-surface B7-H1 expression is not detectable in most normal tissues, except for a fraction of human tissue macrophages<sup>51,52</sup>. Importantly, B7-H1 protein expression could be induced in cells from various tissue origins *in vitro* by inflammatory cytokines such as IFN-γ<sup>52–62</sup>. These findings indicate that expression of B7-H1 protein is controlled by post-transcriptional mechanisms. B7-DC — a homologue of B7-H1 — was identified through screening of subtractive complementary DNA libraries between mouse DCs and macrophages in an effort to identify genes involved in DC function<sup>63</sup>, and its human version was subsequently identified by a homology search<sup>48</sup>. Analysis with specific monoclonal antibodies showed that cell-surface expression of B7-DC is limited to DCs and macrophages<sup>54,61,63,64</sup> — an expression pattern that is similar to CD80/CD86. Interestingly, the expression of B7-H1 and B7-DC by macrophages could be differentially upregulated by T helper 1 (T<sub>H</sub>1)- and T<sub>H</sub>2-cell-derived cytokines, respectively<sup>65</sup>. Distinct expression patterns of B7-H1 and B7-DC therefore suggest broad roles of B7-H1 in peripheral organs and selective roles of B7-DC in lymphoid organs.

**Figure 2 | Models of co-signalling in T-cell activation.**

a | Two-signal model of T-cell activation. In this model, signal one is derived from the T-cell receptor (TCR) after being triggered by antigenic peptide presented by MHC molecules on the surface of antigen-presenting cells (APCs), whereas signal two is mediated by interaction between co-stimulatory receptors (CoRs) and ligands (CoLs). Integration of the two signals induces optimal activation of T cells. Lack of co-stimulatory signals does not induce a response and, in some cases, even induces tolerance or anergy and immunological ignorance. Signal two is dependent on signal one, because in the absence of signal one, ligation of co-stimulatory receptors does not induce a T-cell response.

b | The role of co-stimulators and co-inhibitors in the regulation of TCR signals. The TCR signal, although essential for a T-cell response, does not determine activation or inhibition and depends on signals from co-stimulators and/or co-inhibitors. The outcome of an antigen-specific T-cell response is guided by the balance between co-stimulatory and co-inhibitory signals, which are often simultaneously provided to T cells by their surrounding cells, including APCs.

**IMMUNORECEPTOR TYROSINE-BASED INHIBITORY MOTIF (ITIM).** A structural motif containing tyrosine residues that is found in the cytoplasmic tails of several inhibitory receptors. The prototype six-amino-acid ITIM sequence is (Ile/Val/Leu/Ser)-Xaa-Tyr-Xaa-Xaa-(Leu/Val). Ligand-induced clustering of these inhibitory receptors results in tyrosine phosphorylation, often by SRC-family tyrosine kinases, which provides a docking site for the recruitment of cytoplasmic phosphatases that have an SH2 domain.

**IMMUNORECEPTOR TYROSINE-BASED SWITCH MOTIF (ITSM).** A structural motif containing tyrosine residues that is found in the cytoplasmic tails of several CD2-family molecules, such as CD84, CD229, CD244, NTB-A and CS1. The prototype six-amino-acid ITSM sequence is Thr-Xaa-Tyr-Xaa-Xaa-(Val/Ile). The receptors with ITSMs are bound and regulated by small SH2-domain-containing adaptor proteins such as SH2D1A and EAT2, leading to association with other SH2-domain-containing molecules, which functions as a signalling ‘switch’.

**NEGATIVE SELECTION**  
The deletion of self-reactive thymocytes in the thymus. Thymocytes expressing T-cell receptors that strongly recognize self-peptide bound to self-MHC undergo apoptosis in response to the signalling generated by high-affinity binding.

**EXPRESSED-SEQUENCE TAG DATABASE**  
By searching the expressed-sequence tag database, several overlapping sequence fragments can be assembled into a full-length gene.

In contrast to consistent findings that support a role for PD1 as a co-inhibitor, the roles of B7-H1 and B7-DC are far less clear (TABLE 3). In fact, experimental evidence indicates that B7-H1 and B7-DC could be either co-stimulators or co-inhibitors. In the presence of agonist CD3-specific monoclonal antibodies as a mimic antigen signal, immobilized B7-H1-immunoglobulin or B7-DC–immunoglobulin was found to be either stimulatory<sup>51,53,63,64</sup> or inhibitory<sup>48,50</sup> for T-cell growth and cytokine secretion *in vitro*. B7-H1 co-stimulation is found to be CD28 independent<sup>53</sup> and B7-DC further promotes CD80/CD86 co-stimulation<sup>64</sup>. Moreover, a series of *in vivo* studies using either neutralizing monoclonal antibodies, transfected cells or gene knockout mice indicate that endogenous B7-H1 could act either as a co-inhibitor or co-stimulator, whereas B7-DC is largely a co-stimulator. Administration of B7-H1-specific monoclonal antibody prevents the deletion of activated T cells from 2C-TCR-TRANSGENIC MICE by B7-H1<sup>+</sup> tumour cells<sup>52</sup>. Blockade of endogenous B7-H1 by antagonist monoclonal antibodies increases the incidence of autoimmune diabetes in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice<sup>40</sup> and hapten-induced contact hypersensitivity<sup>42</sup>. These results are consistent with the finding that blockade of PD1 by monoclonal antibodies enhanced T-cell responses in all of these systems<sup>40–42</sup>. However, it is worth noting that treatment with B7-H1/B7-DC-specific antagonist antibodies is not always consistent with the effects of PD1 blockade. For example, B7-H1 blockade fails to accelerate EAE in a mouse model<sup>41</sup>. B7-DC blockade also had no effect on autoimmune diabetes and contact hypersensitivity, with only a moderate effect on the severity of EAE without affecting disease onset<sup>40–42</sup>. Therefore, the effect of B7-H1/B7-DC-specific monoclonal antibodies could not be simply interpreted as the result of blocking the interaction of B7-H1/B7-DC with PD1. One could argue that both B7-H1 and B7-DC need to be blocked simultaneously to prevent functional compensation. Although this argument remains to be tested, several results have recently been published indicating that B7-H1/B7-DC are co-stimulatory *in vivo*. B7-H1-specific antagonist monoclonal antibodies inhibited T-cell responses in a mouse model of inflammatory bowel disease<sup>66</sup>, indicating a stimulatory role of B7-H1 for T-cell responses in the pathogenesis of this disease. Moreover, transgenic expression of B7-H1 by islet β-cells increased the incidence of insulitis/diabetes and accelerated the rejection of transplanted islet cells in MHC-mismatched mice<sup>67</sup>. Consistent with these findings, purified DCs from B7-DC-deficient mice have decreased ability to stimulate T-cell responses to nominal and allogenic antigens<sup>64</sup>, and expression of transfected B7-DC by tumour cells resulted in increased immunogenicity for the stimulation and clonal expansion of antigen-specific cytolytic T cells in syngeneic animals<sup>68</sup>. In summary, although PD1 seems to be an exclusive co-inhibitor, B7-H1 and B7-DC have dual functions as co-stimulators and co-inhibitors.

New co-stimulatory receptor(s) for B7-H1 and B7-DC?

Because PD1 is a co-inhibitor, when B7-H1 and B7-DC were found to bind PD1, it was proposed that the dominant effect of B7-H1 and B7-DC is to downregulate T-cell responses. As a result of this speculation, B7-H1 was renamed as PDL1, and B7-DC was termed PDL2 to reflect this association<sup>48,50</sup>. However, we also need to take into account the experimental data described earlier indicating that B7-H1 and B7-DC can act as co-stimulators. Several recent studies indicate that the co-stimulatory functions of B7-H1 and B7-DC are related to a different receptor from PD1. Both B7-H1 and B7-DC mutants with abolished PD1 binding could still co-stimulate proliferation and cytokine production by T cells<sup>69</sup>. Furthermore, the co-stimulatory functions of B7-H1 and B7-DC are not affected for PD1-deficient T cells<sup>64,68,69</sup>. Importantly, B7-DC can bind to PD1-deficient T cells and enhance T-cell killing

by a PD1-independent mechanism<sup>68</sup>. Therefore, it seems that B7-H1 and B7-DC bind at least one additional receptor other than PD1 to mediate their co-stimulatory functions. Whether B7-H1 and B7-DC bind to the same co-stimulatory receptor remains to be clarified<sup>68</sup>. An emerging hypothesis is that B7-H1 and B7-DC expression in lymphoid tissues can co-stimulate recently primed T cells, whereas B7-H1 expression in peripheral tissues downregulates immune responses by inhibiting activated or memory T cells (FIG. 3). Therefore, a balance of T-cell responses in different states of activation and the degree of their exposure to B7-H1/B7-DC signals would determine the outcome of B7-H1 and B7-DC blockade. In addition, a reverse signal phenomenon by B7-H1/B7-DC might also need to be taken into account.

**Reverse signalling by B7-H1 and B7-DC.** Recent studies indicate that B7-H1 and B7-DC are capable of reverse signalling. B7-H1 is expressed at high levels by activated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Ligation of B7-H1 on T cells by either specific monoclonal antibodies or immobilized PD1 co-stimulates T-cell growth and cytokine secretion. However, stimulation of T cells seems to turn on the

programmed cell death pathway rapidly, accompanied by the upregulation of TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), caspase-3 and caspase-10 (REF. 70). Therefore, B7-H1 reverse signalling might accelerate the turnover and homeostasis of peripheral T cells, which might be involved in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. Interestingly, a similar reverse-signal mechanism is also found for B7-DC expressed by DCs. Crosslinking of B7-DC on DCs by pentameric IgM antibodies leads to the activation of DCs, which subsequently enhances their ability to stimulate T cells<sup>71,72</sup>. It is particularly interesting that B7-DC has only one intracellular amino acid. Therefore, it is possible that signal transduction by B7-DC is mediated through a putative adaptor. B7-H1 and B7-DC reverse signalling in the regulation of T-cell immunity and their roles in the pathogenesis of human diseases, however, remain to be determined.

**The role of B7-H1 in T-cell apoptosis.** Several recent studies support a role for B7-H1 in the induction of programmed cell death, especially in effector T cells. Tumour lines that spontaneously express B7-H1 or express transfected B7-H1 increase the apoptosis of

Figure 3 | **The co-signal network model.** Co-stimulators (yellow) and co-inhibitors (brown) have overlapping but preferential functions in controlling one or more stages of T-cell activation, including priming, differentiation, maturation and potentially memory responses. Naive T cells in lymphoid organs constitutively express CD28. After ligation by its ligands, CD80 or CD86, initial priming occurs. A series of co-stimulator and co-inhibitor interactions take place after the initial events, which allow further differentiation and maturation of primed T cells to effector T cells. It seems that a large number of co-signalling molecules operate during this stage. Interactions between co-stimulatory molecules, such as CD137–CD137 ligand (CD137L), OX40–OX40 ligand (OX40L), and B7-H1/B7-DC and their putative co-stimulatory receptor(s), promote T-cell differentiation and maturation, whereas interactions between co-inhibitors, including CD80/CD86–CTLA4 (cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4) and B7-H4 with its putative receptor, can suppress the transition to the effector T-cell phenotype. After migration into peripheral tissues, effector T cells are again subjected to regulation by co-signals provided by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and host cells for their effector functions. At this stage, co-inhibitors are dominant to prevent potential damage of tissues. Co-inhibitory pathways include B7-H1–PD1 (programmed cell death 1), B7-H4–B7-H4 receptor and B7-DC–PD1, as well as reverse signalling through T-cell-associated B7-H1. Co-signalling molecules also control the apoptotic process of effector T cells. There is less evidence showing dependence on co-signals for the generation of memory T cells.

antigen-specific CD4⁺ and CD8⁺ T-cell clones *in vitro*⁵². In a mouse model, adoptive transfer of activated 2C-TCR-transgenic T cells led to increased deletion of these T cells by B7-H1 expressed by tumour cells *in vivo*⁵². These results indicate that B7-H1 can contribute to the deletion of effector cells in peripheral tissues. In normal circumstances, antigen-activated CD8⁺ T cells accumulate in the liver and undergo apoptosis through an unknown mechanism⁷³,⁷⁴. In B7-H1-knockout mice, the deletion of effector CD8⁺ T cells is impaired, leading to accumulation of effector T cells and increased susceptibility of hepatocytes to the induction of experimental hepatitis⁷⁵. In addition to impaired apoptosis of effector T cells, B7-H1-knockout mice have spontaneous accumulation of CD8⁺ T cells in the liver in the absence of exposure to exogenous antigen⁷⁵. Constitutive expression of B7-H1 has been found in human⁵² and mouse⁴⁴ Kupffer cells, which are potent APCs in the liver. These observations indicate a role for B7-H1 in the deletion of autoreactive T cells in the liver. Collectively, these studies show that the induction of programmed T-cell death by B7-H1 might be an important mechanism of B7-H1 in the negative regulation of effector T-cell responses.

In summary, we are just beginning to understand the complexity of this new regulatory pathway involving B7-H1, B7-DC, PD1 and possibly one more member. At present, experimental data support the idea that B7-H1 and B7-DC could downregulate T-cell responses through PD1. B7-H1 expression is widely inducible in peripheral tissue, which might allow the negative regulation of effector T cells in inflammatory tissues. The restricted expression of B7-DC by DCs and macrophages indicates that it might have a selective role in lymphoid organs for co-stimulation and co-inhibition of T-cell responses. Through a reverse signalling mechanism, B7-H1/B7-DC might also be involved in the regulation of T cells and DCs *in vivo* (FIG. 4).

### Emerging co-inhibitors: B7-H4 and BTLA

B7-H4 (B7S1, B7X) is a recently identified B7-family member with co-inhibitory function⁷⁶⁻⁷⁸. B7-H4 has about 25% homology in the extracellular portion with other B7-family members. Despite mRNA expression in various human tissues, immunohistochemistry analysis does not reveal positive staining for protein in any tissues or organs from healthy human individuals⁷⁹, indicating a tight control of B7-H4 protein expression, possibly at the posttranslational level. Cell-surface B7-H4 expression can be induced on human T cells, B cells, monocytes and DCs after *in vitro* stimulation. In mice, B7-H4 was found to be expressed constitutively by B220⁺ B cells in the spleen and to be downregulated after activation. Immobilized B7-H4-immunoglobulin inhibited T-cell proliferation, prevented them from entering the cell cycle and reduced the secretion of IL-2, IL-4, IL-10 and IFN-γ in response to CD3/CD80 stimulation. In a parent-to-F1
transplantation model, treatment of recipients with GVHD by B7-H4–immunoglobulin significantly reduced cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) activity against allogeneic antigen<sup>76</sup>. Furthermore, the administration of blocking monoclonal antibody specific for B7-H4 resulted in exacerbation of EAE<sup>77</sup>. Together, these studies reveal an important role for B7-H4 as a co-inhibitor of T-cell immunity.

BTLA was recently identified as an immunoglobulin-superfamily member with limited homology to CTLA4 (REF. 80). BTLA is found on activated but not naive T cells. Interestingly, BTLA seems to have sustained expression by T<sub>H</sub>1 cells. Two ITIMs were identified in the cytoplasmic domain of BTLA, and crosslinking of BTLA induces the phosphorylation and association of SHP1 and SHP2. Importantly, Btla-deficient mice were much more susceptible to the induction of EAE and had increased antibody responses. In addition, Btla-deficient T cells have increased responses to antigen stimulation *in vitro*<sup>80</sup>. These data clearly indicate a role for BTLA as a co-inhibitor.

It has been reported that BTLA is the receptor for B7-H4 (REFS 78, 80). In support of this, the B7-H4–immunoglobulin fusion protein has been shown to bind to wild-type but not Btla-deficient T cells<sup>80</sup>. This result, however, needs to be interpreted with caution, because it is still possible that the receptor for B7-H4 is downregulated in the absence of BTLA (FIG. 4). Therefore, it remains to be clarified whether BTLA is the receptor for B7-H4 or an upstream molecule that regulates expression of the B7-H4 receptor.

### B7-H3: another co-inhibitor?

B7-H3 was initially identified to function as a T-cell co-stimulator through a receptor distinct from CD28, CTLA4, inducible co-stimulatory molecule (ICOS) and PD1 (REF. 81). mRNA encoding B7-H3 is widely detected in lymphoid and non-lymphoid tissues in humans and

mice<sup>82,83</sup>, whereas B7-H3 protein is not constitutively expressed, but can be induced on monocytes by granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and on DCs by IFN-γ<sup>81</sup>. A B7-H3–immunoglobulin fusion protein binds activated but not resting T cells, indicating the expression of a receptor on the surface of activated T cells<sup>81</sup>. In the presence of CD3-specific monoclonal antibody, B7-H3–immunoglobulin enhances human T-cell proliferation and selectively induces IFN-γ production<sup>81</sup>. In addition, the expression of B7-H3 by human melanoma-cell lines results in increased cytolytic activity of CTLs against the allogeneic tumour targets<sup>81</sup>. Blockade of B7-H3 expression on DCs by anti-sense oligonucleotides inhibits IFN-γ production by DC-stimulated allogeneic T cells<sup>81</sup>. Consistent with these findings, the injection of a mouse B7-H3 expression plasmid directly into an established mouse lymphoma induces partial regression of the tumour, which is largely dependent on CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and natural killer (NK) cells<sup>82</sup>. Collectively, these results support a role for B7-H3 as a co-stimulator of T-cell responses.

Several recent studies, however, indicate that B7-H3 might also have inhibitory functions in certain circumstances. By adenovirus-mediated expression of GM-CSF and IL-12 in airways to pre-sensitize T<sub>H</sub>1 cells, lung infiltration of lymphocytes and macrophages is increased to a greater degree in B7-H3-knockout mice than in control mice after exposure to a model antigen<sup>84</sup>. By contrast, pre-sensitization with GM-CSF alone, which might lead to a T<sub>H</sub>2-cell-inducing microenvironment in the airways, does not alter lung inflammation in B7-H3-knockout mice. These results indicate an inhibitory function for B7-H3 in T<sub>H</sub>1- but not T<sub>H</sub>2-cell-mediated airway inflammation. A small acceleration of the onset of EAE was also observed in B7-H3-knockout mice<sup>84</sup>. Interestingly, serum concentrations of autoantibodies specific for single-stranded DNA also increase in a fraction of aged (17 months) B7-H3-knockout mice<sup>84</sup>.

B7-H3 deficiency, however, does not affect CD8+ T-cell responses to lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus<sup>84</sup>. Therefore, the functions of endogenous B7-H3, which can be deduced from the studies of B7-H3-knockout mice, seem to be different from those of B7-H3 overexpression, as indicated previously. At present, the receptor for B7-H3 has not been identified, which hampers further study. Current data do not exclude the possibility that B7-H3 could engage two distinct functional receptors to have opposite functions (FIG. 4).

In addition to the originally identified two-domain structure containing an immunoglobulin variable (IgV) domain and an immunoglobulin constant (IgC) domain (2IgB7-H3) for both mouse and human B7-H3, a four-domain structure containing IgV-IgC-IgV-IgC (4IgB7-H3) has also been documented in human and monkey, but not in mouse and hamster, B7-H3-encoding genomic DNA<sup>82,83,85</sup>. A recent study showed that the main form of B7-H3 expressed by DCs is 4IgB7-H3 (REF. 86). The function of 4IgB7-H3, however, is unclear. Ling *et al.*<sup>85</sup> showed that 4IgB7-H3 fusion proteins inhibit T-cell responses in a co-stimulation assay *in vitro*, whereas Steinberger *et al.*<sup>86</sup> showed that expression of 4IgB7-H3 by a monocytic cell line does not affect the activation of allogeneic T cells. Therefore, although B7-H3 is a potential co-inhibitor, as indicated by studies in knockout mice, further studies are needed to clarify its functions.

Therapeutic applications of co-inhibitors

In principle, the blockade of co-inhibitory pathways by antagonists, such as blocking monoclonal antibodies or decoy receptors, should lead to the enhancement of T-cell responses. Such strategies could be applied to promote T-cell immunity against tumour antigens or viral infection. Conversely, enhancing the co-inhibitory pathway by agonists might suppress T-cell-mediated immune responses and could potentially be applied to treat autoimmune diseases, transplantation rejection and inflammatory responses. Manipulation of co-inhibitors therefore provides possibilities for the development of new therapeutics. Ongoing clinical trials and potential approaches using co-inhibitors are summarized in TABLE 4.

CTLA4–immunoglobulin fusion protein has been tested for its inhibitory function in a wide variety of disease models<sup>4</sup>. In clinical trials, the administration of CTLA4–immunoglobulin has been shown to inhibit severe psoriasis<sup>28,29</sup> and rheumatoid arthritis<sup>30</sup>, providing marked clinical benefit without severe side effects. Therefore, CTLA4–immunoglobulin is a promising therapeutic agent for other T-cell-mediated autoimmune diseases and possibly transplant rejection. In preclinical models, the administration of CTLA4–immunoglobulin could induce either transient or permanent T-cell unresponsiveness<sup>4</sup>, indicating a role for CTLA4–immunoglobulin in the induction of tolerance. Blockade of CTLA4 by neutralizing monoclonal antibody has also been applied clinically for enhancing tumour immunity. In a clinical trial with a single dose of humanized monoclonal antibody specific for CTLA4, inflammatory responses to melanoma antigens were induced when given to patients who had previously received a GM-CSF-modified cancer-cell vaccine<sup>87</sup>. More frequent injections of the same CTLA4 monoclonal antibody, however, induced organ-non-specific autoimmune diseases with a moderate antitumour effect<sup>88</sup>. These studies imply that CTLA4-specific monoclonal antibody has a narrow window for therapeutic application for cancer treatment.

B7-H1 is constitutively expressed by human cancer tissues<sup>52,89–91</sup>, indicating that a mechanism of gene regulation at the posttranslational level is impaired. Several

lines of evidence indicate that B7-H1 is involved in immune evasion⁹². Similarly, B7-H1-specific antagonist monoclonal antibody enhanced the immunotherapeutic efficacy of adoptive transfer of polyclonal T cells against squamous-cell carcinoma⁸⁹. B7-H1-specific antagonist monoclonal antibody also induced the regression of a strongly immunogenic P815 tumour in a mouse model⁹¹. In addition to tumour cells, B7-H1 expression is upregulated by human DCs that infiltrate ovarian cancers in response to tumour and host macrophage-derived factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor and IL-10. B7-H1-specific antagonist monoclonal antibody enhanced T-cell responses *in vitro* and inhibited ovarian tumour growth in a xenografted mouse model⁹³. B7-H1 antagonists, alone or in combination with other therapeutic modalities, such as cancer vaccines, represent a promising approach for cancer therapy. Alternatively, blockade of PD1 by monoclonal antibody is also potentially useful in inhibiting negative signals to enhance immunity against cancer and viral antigens. In this regard, B7-H4 is also expressed by 85% of ovarian cancer and 31% of lung cancer samples⁷⁹ and might have a role in evasion of tumour immunity by some human cancers. Blockade of B7-H4, alone or in conjunction with other therapeutic modalities, is a potentially exciting approach to enhance tumour immunity.

Autoantibodies specific for B7-H1 have been detected in a marked fraction (>30%) of the sera from patients with rheumatoid arthritis. In a study by Dong *et al*.⁷⁰, the patients with clinically active rheumatoid disease were most likely to have these autoantibodies, indicating that B7-H1-specific autoantibodies are involved in disease progression. Because B7-H1-specific autoantibodies co-stimulate CD4⁺ T-cell proliferation leading to subsequent programmed cell death, it was postulated that reverse signalling, through B7-H1 on T cells, has a role in aberrant activation and apoptosis of T cells in patients with rheumatoid arthritis⁷⁰. Therefore, decoy B7-H1 could potentially inhibit the effect of B7-H1-specific autoantibodies and suppress disease progression. Crosslinking of B7-DC on DCs enhanced the activation of DCs by reverse signalling and increased the ability of these DCs to stimulate T-cell responses⁷¹,⁷². Therefore, crosslinking of B7-DC by monoclonal antibodies could be useful for the enhancement of tumour immunity.

During experimental cardiac allograft rejection, PD1, B7-H1 and B7-DC expression is upregulated by mononuclear cells in the graft, indicating a role for these molecules in the inhibition of transplant rejection. In combination with a sub-therapeutic dose of cyclosporin A (CsA), B7-H1–immunoglobulin fusion protein markedly increased allograft survival compared with treatment with CsA or B7-H1–immunoglobulin alone. B7-H1–immunoglobulin also prevented the development of TRANSPLANT ATHEROSCLEROSIS in combination with **CD154**-specific therapy⁹⁴. Treatment with a combination of B7-H1–immunoglobulin and CD154-specific monoclonal antibody also induces long-term survival of islet grafts in allogeneic mouse models⁹⁵. The mechanisms of this synergistic effect are not yet elucidated. B7-H1 expression is found to be upregulated by human muscle cells in idiopathic inflammatory myopathies and has a role in the inhibition of inflammation⁹⁶. These studies support a potential application of B7-H1 agonists in the modulation of transplantation rejection and inflammation.

### Concluding remarks

Co-signalling molecules are controllers of T-cell responses to antigens. By selectively turning on and/or off co-stimulatory and co-inhibitory pathways, the TCR signal could be transiently regulated in positive and negative directions. Therefore, a precise balance between these pathways often determines the outcome of a T-cell response. Present experimental results support a more integrative model of co-signalling networks, rather than the traditional two-signal hypothesis for lymphocyte activation. Co-inhibitory pathways could be viewed as a host mechanism for homeostasis of the immune system. It is probable that more co-inhibitory pathways will be discovered in the near future. Although our understanding of these pathways is still rudimentary, several common themes are emerging, including multiple receptor-ligand interactions, the coexistence of co-inhibitors and co-stimulators in the same pathway, as well as reverse signalling. Diseases such as cancer and rheumatoid arthritis are found to exploit co-inhibitory mechanisms, leading to immune evasion or aberrant autoreactivity. Precise understanding of the molecular and biochemical processes of co-inhibition therefore opens up an exciting area for the development of new therapeutics for human diseases.
