Antigen-presenting molecules, including MHC I, II and CD1, have central roles in the induction of T cell-mediated immunity against pathogens and tumors and also in the maintenance of tolerance towards self-antigens. The presentation of exogenously derived peptide and lipid antigens to specific T cells by professional antigen-presenting cells (pAPCs) is an essential part of both processes. Exogenous antigen loading takes place mostly within specialized endocytic and phagocytic compartments of pAPCs and targeting of antigen-presenting molecules to these intracellular compartments is mediated by highly conserved cytoplasmic sorting motifs. Recent data have revealed that the cytoplasmic tails of antigen-presenting molecules, by controlling the access of these molecules to exogenously derived antigens, have a crucially important and largely underappreciated role in the generation of tolerance and T-cell mediated immunity.

However, it is their relatively short, highly conserved cytoplasmic domains that, by controlling the access to specialized antigen-loading compartments of professional antigen-presenting cells (pAPCs), ultimately determine the fate and function of these molecules and the T cells that recognize them.

Two immunological sub-themes have gradually emerged from the past two decades of studies on antigen presentation. The first involves the generation of T-cell epitopes through the processing and loading of exogenously derived antigens onto antigen-presenting molecules within endocytic compartments of pAPCs. As we will discuss, the significance of this process has long been recognized for MHC II-restricted antigen presentation to CD4⁺ T cells but only more recently has its importance been recognized for MHC I- and CD1-restricted antigen presentation to CD8⁺ and natural killer (NK) T cells, respectively. Long considered to be an alternative pathway of antigen presentation, so-called ‘cross-presentation’ of exogenous antigens by classical MHC I molecules has now been shown to be crucial for CD8⁺ T cell-mediated immunity against tumor, bacterial and viral antigens, in addition to tolerance towards self-antigens.

The second immunological sub-theme has emerged through the identification of highly conserved endocytic-sorting motifs (Box 1) within the cytoplasmic domains of antigen-presenting molecules. As outlined later, such motifs are essential for the trafficking of these molecules through endocytic and phagocytic compartments of dendritic cells (DCs), in which processed, exogenously derived antigens can be loaded for subsequent presentation to T cells. The high degree of conservation demonstrated by these trafficking motifs probably underscores their importance in the generation and maintenance of T cell-mediated immunity.

These two sub-themes are intimately related and together comprise a general immunological concept in which cytoplasmic endocytic-sorting motifs of antigen-presenting molecules control the acquisition and presentation of exogenously derived antigens. By controlling access to endocytic antigen-loading compartments, these sorting motifs have a major role in enhancing the diversity of antigenic epitopes ultimately presented to T lymphocytes, and thus serve to significantly expand the breadth

Box 1. Endocytic-sorting motifs

The cytoplasmic domains of integral membrane proteins often contain linear amino acid sequences or motifs that directly control their trafficking and intracellular localization (reviewed in Refs [4,65]). Specific motifs are recognized by trafficking components and act as intracellular 'addressins', directing localization of membrane proteins to specific compartments within the cell. Of particular importance for antigen-presenting molecules are the so-called endocytic-sorting motifs that direct membrane proteins into endosomal compartments. Proteins that traffic through endosomes and lysosomes often possess one of two major known endocytic-sorting motifs: dileucine-based or tyrosine-based.

Dileucine-based motifs were initially identified in the cytoplasmic tail of the CD3-γ chain and are responsible for its rapid internalization and transport to lysosomes [81]. Such motifs often consist of two adjacent cytoplasmic leucine or isoleucine residues that are recognized by specific adaptin proteins (APs). Two distinct classes of dileucine motifs, based on differential binding to distinct APs, have been proposed that are often (but not always) characterized by the presence of an acidic residue three or four amino acids to the N-terminal side of the first leucine [65]. Through recognition of these motifs, several transmembrane proteins [including invariant chain (Ii), CD3 and glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4)] gain access to intracellular vesicular trafficking pathways that ultimately deliver them to endosomal and lysosomal compartments.

Tyrosine-based endocytic motifs were first identified when a tyrosine residue in the cytosolic domain of the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor was shown to be required for its rapid internalization from the cell surface [82]. Since this discovery nearly 20 years ago, dozens of other transmembrane proteins, including CD1, lysosome-associated membrane protein-1 (LAMP-1) and the transferrin receptor, have been shown to contain tyrosine-based endocytic motifs that fall into two classes: motifs containing the sequence NPXY or those containing the sequence YXXØ, where X represents any amino acid and Ø represents an amino acid with a bulky, hydrophobic side chain. These sequences interact directly with APs involved in the initial formation of clathrin-coated transport vesicles [83].

and efficiency of T cell-mediated immune responses in vivo.

MHC II molecules

Although MHC II molecules are now recognized to be capable of presenting selected endogenously synthesized antigens, they have long been characterized as molecules that acquire and present antigens derived primarily from exogenous sources [1]. MHC II molecules in pAPCs acquire these antigens within specialized endolysosomal compartments, referred to as MHC II compartments (MIICs) [1–3]. Several studies have shown that endocytic trafficking motifs have crucial roles in bringing the major players within the MHC II antigen-presentation pathway together within these specialized organelles [4].

MIICs are specialized intracellular structures that are thought to intersect with the endocytic pathway in pAPCs and contain internalized antigens derived from the extracellular milieu [5–7]. MHC II molecules gain access to these antigen-loading compartments largely through their association with the invariant chain (Ii) [8,9]. Trimerized Ii molecules bind to three newly synthesized MHC II molecules (each consisting of an αβ heterodimer) in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen to form nonamer complexes. The cytoplasmic tail of the MHC II β chain masks an ER retention sequence located in the cytoplasmic tail of Ii and is crucial for the initial egress of nascent MHC II complexes from the ER [10]. Ii serves to prevent the binding of peptides derived from the secretory pathway and also mediates sorting from the trans-Golgi into MIICs of the endocytic pathway [11,12] (Figure 1a). This intracellular trafficking step is mediated by a pair of leucine-based signals within the cytoplasmic domain of Ii (Table 1), which are recognized by the adaptor proteins, AP1 and AP2 [13,14]. Deletion of these Ii sorting motifs abrogates transport of MHC II molecules to MIICs, thereby abolishing presentation of numerous MHC II-restricted antigens [15,16].

Once in the acidic, protease-rich MIICs, the Ii chain is progressively degraded by proteolytic enzymes of the cathepsin family [17]. Binding of antigenic peptides to MHC II molecules requires removal of the class II-associated Ii peptide (CLIP) fragment by the MHC-encoded HLA-DM [18]. This non-classical MHC II molecule facilitates classical MHC II antigenic peptide binding and, in its absence, diversity of MHC II-restricted peptide presentation is reduced and increased levels of MHC II-CLIP complexes are observed [19,20]. The cytoplasmic domain of the HLA-DMβ chain contains a highly conserved tyrosine-based motif (YTPL) that is responsible for its localization largely within endolysosomal compartments [21], although HLA-DM can also associate with Ii and be directed to similar compartments by Ii dileucine-based targeting. Mutation of the tyrosine-based motif of HLA-DM in the absence of Ii expression results in a further reduction in MHC II restricted peptide presentation, providing additional evidence for a crucial role of endocytic signals in classical MHC II-restricted antigen presentation [22].

Of note, HLA-DO, a non-classical MHC II molecule expressed mainly by B cells, appears to modulate the function of HLA-DM by reducing its CLIP proteolytic activity and limiting the pH range at which effective peptide exchange can occur [20]. Because HLA-DO is downregulated in germinal center B cells, it has been postulated that optimal affinity maturation and production of the highest avidity B cells requires the elevated HLA-DM activity found in the absence of HLA-DO. Outside of this environment, HLA-DO might act to broadly suppress B-cell antigen-presentation function [23]. Like the other components of the MHC II processing pathway, the cytoplasmic tail of HLA-DO contains a dileucine motif (Table 1) that is functional and can mediate its localization to endolysosomal compartments, although the tyrosine motif of associated HLA-DM can also suffice for this purpose [24].

On proteolytic removal of CLIP and antigenic peptide binding within MIICs, classical MHC II-peptide complexes are transported to the cell surface for presentation to CD4⁺ T cells (Figure 1a). Once at the cell surface, MHC II heterodimers can recycle through endocytic compartments that are distinct from the more highly proteolytic, late endosomal MIICs, through which nascent MHC II molecules initially traffic [6,25]. Nonetheless, the pH in

Figure 1. Cytoplasmic-sorting motifs of antigen-presenting molecules control the intracellular trafficking and acquisition of exogenous antigens in pAPCs. (a) MHC II molecules. Nascent MHC II heterotrimers (α-β-li) exit the ER by the secretory pathway. Two dileucine-based motifs (blue) in the cytoplasmic domain of li direct sorting of these complexes from the trans-Golgi network (G) into MIICs of the endocytic pathway. li is progressively degraded, leaving the li-derived CLIP peptide bound in the peptide-binding groove of the MHC II αβ heterodimers. HLA-DM, which localizes to MIICs by way of a cytoplasmic tyrosine-based sorting motif (red), catalyzes the removal of CLIP and enables the binding of exogenously derived peptide antigens (orange) to MHC II αβ heterodimers. HLA-DO, which modulates the function of HLA-DM, uses a dileucine-based endocytic motif for its localization within MIICs. Following antigenic peptide binding, MHC II-peptide complexes are transported to the cell surface for presentation to CD4+ T cells. Dileucine-based and other sorting signals within the cytoplasmic domains of the MHC II α and β chains can subsequently direct recycling of such complexes through early endosomes (EEs), in which sampling of a subset of exogenous peptides that are distinct from those found within MIICs occurs. (b) CD1 molecules. Nascent CD1 α chains associate with β2m and self-derived lipids (green) in the ER before trafficking to the plasma membrane by the secretory pathway. CD1a molecules are then sorted into recycling EEs by an unknown mechanism, where they bind to exogenously derived lipids (orange) before trafficking back to the cell surface in an ARF6-dependent manner. CD1b, CD1c and CD1d contain diverse tyrosine-based endocytic motifs that are responsible for their differential sorting and trafficking through distinct compartments of the endocytic system, including recycling EEs, late endosomal (LE) and lysosomal (Ly) compartments. The distinct intracellular trafficking patterns demonstrated by different CD1 molecules probably enables a broader degree of antigen sampling and increased diversity of lipid-antigen presentation. (c) MHC I molecules. Nascent MHC I α chains in the ER bind to β2m and acquire endogenously synthesized peptides (green) delivered from the cytosol before following the secretory route to the plasma membrane. Acquisition of exogenous peptide antigens (orange) for cross-presentation takes place mainly in post-Golgi, LE or phagolysosomal compartments (PL) compartments. HLA-A and -B molecules probably access these endocytic compartments through a cytoplasmic tyrosine motif-dependent recycling mechanism, whereas HLA-C probably depends on a dileucine motif. MHC I molecules might also be sorted into exogenous antigen-loading compartments from the trans-Golgi, or directly from the ER by the recently-described mechanism of ER-mediated phagocytosis [60].

these early endocytic recycling compartments is low enough to facilitate peptide exchange and it has been proposed that such recycling might serve to provide MHC II molecules with the opportunity to acquire and present a subset of antigens to CD4+ T cells that is distinct from those found in MIICs [26,27]. Recycling is mediated by sorting signals present in the cytoplasmic tails of both the HLA-DRα and β chains and is essential for the acquisition

^b Classical MHC molecules are distinguished by their high degree of polymorphism, ability to present peptide antigens directly to T cells and their central role in the generation of most CD4⁺ and CD8⁺ T-cell responses. Non-classical MHC II molecules are not expressed at the cell surface but have a role in quality control in the classical MHC II antigen-presentation pathway. Non-classical MHC I molecules are expressed at the cell surface but show a more restricted cell-type expression pattern compared with classical MHC I molecules. They bind to β₂m and to a limited repertoire of self-derived peptides, serving as recognition elements for subsets of NK and T cells. For excellent reviews on non-classical MHC molecules, see Refs.

tyrosine-based sorting motif, is still able to recycle through, and acquire antigens within, EEs through a mechanism that remains largely undefined. At the present time, little is known about the intracellular trafficking and antigen-presentation characteristics of CD1e, which completely lacks a cytoplasmic tail (Table 1).

### MHC I molecules

The classical immunological paradigm of antigen presentation has MHC II molecules presenting extracellular antigens whereas MHC I molecules present antigens that are synthesized intracellularly [38,39]. Recent evidence has shown that this apparent dichotomy, although accurate for describing most somatic cells, does not hold true for pAPCs [40–44].

Nascent MHC I molecules generally bind to cytosol-derived peptide antigens that have been imported into the ER by the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) following cytoplasmic processing by the proteasome. Under the classical paradigm (so-called ‘direct presentation’), these MHC I-peptide complexes are transported to the cell surface for presentation to CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells, where they remain for several hours before being transported to lysosomes for degradation (Figure 1c). However, pAPCs can present exogenously derived antigens in the context of MHC I molecules in a process known as cross-presentation. DC cross-presentation of exogenous antigens to CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells leads to cross-priming, a process now recognized to be essential for establishing tolerance to self-antigens, as well as for generating optimal cell-mediated immune responses against numerous viral, bacterial and tumor antigens *in vivo* [45–49].

Although cross-priming was first recognized nearly 30 years ago [50], the mechanisms leading to cross-presentation have only recently begun to be elucidated. Some controversy has surrounded the subject because of seemingly conflicting reports showing that cross-presentation of some exogenous antigens is TAP-independent, whereas others strictly require TAP [43]. The lack of TAP dependence led to the conclusion that some MHC I peptide ligands are generated and loaded directly within LE compartments [51,52]. This so-called vacuolar pathway probably involves antigens that are endocytosed or pinocytosed by pAPCs and which are subjected to degradation by lysosomal enzymes. Cathepsin S, in particular, is crucial for generating MHC I peptide ligands for cross-presentation through the TAP-independent pathway [53]. However, several studies have shown that cross-presentation of some antigens requires proteasomal processing and have demonstrated that internalized antigen can be transported into the cytosol following uptake by pAPCs [54–56].

Recently, breakthroughs in resolving these apparent conflicts were made independently by several laboratories, confirming that loading of exogenous antigens onto MHC I molecules does occur within specialized endocytic [lysosomal-associated membrane protein-1 (LAMP-1)-positive] compartments, rather than in the conventional ER [49,57–59]. At least some of these compartments are formed by the fusion of the ER with phagocytic vesicles, in a process termed ER-mediated phagocytosis [60]. Such

ER-phagosome fusion compartments contain all of the components necessary for cross-presentation of exogenous antigens, including MHC I, β<sub>2</sub>m, TAP and tapasin, in addition to proteasome complexes, which are associated with the cytoplasmic face of the phagocytic antigen-loading compartments [57–59].

A new model that has emerged from these studies has phagocytosed exogenous proteins, following limited proteolysis within phagosome-ER fusion compartments, being exported to the cytosol using a mechanism similar to ER-associated degradation (ERAD), potentially involving the transporter Sec61 [61]. In the cytosol, they are processed into peptides by the associated proteasome complexes and then re-imported into the same phagolyosomal (PL) compartments for binding to MHC I molecules, which are subsequently transported to the cell surface (Figure 2). Transport of processed peptides back into PL compartments is likely to occur through conventional ER-derived TAP complexes. It should be noted that TAP-independent exogenous peptide loading might also potentially occur for some antigens in PL compartments but is more likely to be the rule within LE compartments that do not contain TAP complexes (Figure 2). The recent characterization of ABCB9, a TAP1-like molecule that localizes to LAMP-1-positive compartments [62], has raised the intriguing possibility that this molecule might also contribute to cross-presentation in pAPCs.

Recent work has demonstrated that a highly conserved tyrosine residue found within the cytoplasmic domain of MHC I molecules is required for presentation of exogenously acquired, but not endogenously synthesized, antigens in murine DCs [49]. Mutation of this tyrosine residue abrogates transport of MHC I molecules to endolysosomal (LAMP-1-positive) compartments, in which loading of the immunodominant peptide from exogenously pulsed ovalbumin protein occurs. The conserved YXXA sequence contained within MHC I cytoplasmic domains is highly reminiscent of tyrosine-based YXXØ endocytic motifs found in other transmembrane proteins. Thus, YXXA might constitute an endocytic-sorting motif directly responsible for the trafficking of MHC I molecules through endocytic exogenous antigen-loading compartments and for the ability of MHC I molecules to cross-present antigens.

MHC I molecules have also been observed within endocytic compartments of human DCs, where they acquire exogenous antigens for cross-presentation [59,63]. HLA-A and HLA-B molecules both contain homologous YXXA motifs (Table 1), suggesting that endocytic trafficking is controlled by similar mechanisms to those used by murine MHC I molecules. HLA-C lacks the conserved tyrosine residue found in most class I cytoplasmic domains but is instead likely to be dependent on a unique downstream dileucine motif (Table 1) for its endocytic trafficking [64]. It will be interesting to determine whether this difference causes HLA-C molecules to sample distinct subsets of antigens from those sampled by HLA-A and -B [65].

One unresolved question concerns the ultimate source of MHC I molecules within endocytic antigen-loading compartments. It is possible that a subset of nascent MHC I molecules is sorted directly to these compartments

Figure 2. Multiple routes of peptide antigen loading for MHC I molecules in pAPCs. Representation of antigen transport and processing (thin arrows) and MHC I intracellular trafficking (thick arrows), depicting three proposed models for antigen loading and presentation in pAPCs. (a) Direct presentation. Endogenously synthesized proteins (green) are degraded by cytosolic proteasome complexes into antigenic peptides, which are transported by TAP into the ER for binding to nascent MHC I α chain–β₂m heterodimers. MHC I complexes loaded with endogenously derived peptides (green) are then transported from the ER through the Golgi (G) and to the plasma membrane (PM) by the secretory pathway. (b) Cross-presentation model 1: TAP-independent endolysosomal loading of exogenously derived peptide antigens. Extracellular protein antigens (orange) are taken up by pAPCs by endocytosis, then transported through EEs to LE compartments, where they are degraded into antigenic peptides (orange) by resident proteases and cathepsin S. MHC I molecules gain access to LEs by recycling from the cell surface or possibly by direct transport from the trans-Golgi network. Low pH within LE compartments facilitates peptide exchange, enabling MHC I molecules to bind exogenously derived peptide antigens before being transported to the cell surface for cross-presentation to T cells. (c) Cross-presentation model 2: TAP-dependent exogenous antigen loading facilitated by ER-mediated phagocytosis. Extracellular antigens are phagocytosed in a process involving fusion of the ER with the PM. Such ER-phagosome mix ('phagolysosome', PL) compartments contain ER components, such as TAP, tapasin and Sec 61, which enable their ability to act as self-sufficient organelles for cross-presentation. Phagocytosed exogenous protein antigens are partially degraded, then transported into the cytosol by the Sec61 transporter, where they are further degraded by proteosome complexes associated with the cytosolic face of the PL compartment. Exogenously derived peptides produced in this manner are transported back into the same PL compartments by TAP, where they replace peptides bound to MHC I molecules derived from the ER or PM.

from the trans-Golgi network, although there exists only limited evidence to support this pathway [49]. Cytoplasmic tail-dependent internalization and recycling of MHC I molecules in lymphoid cell lines and macrophages suggests that endocytic MHC I molecules might be derived from the cell surface [66,67]. The low pH of endolysosomal compartments provides an environment that favors dissociation of antigenic peptides from the class I heavy chain, raising the possibility of a peptide exchange mechanism in which class I molecules internalized from the cell surface exchange weakly bound endogenous peptides for exogenous antigens [68].

Nascent MHC I molecules derived from the ER could also possibly contribute to the endocytic class I pool through ER-mediated endocytosis [60]. ER-mediated endocytosis probably results in endoglycosidase (Endo) H-sensitive class I molecules at the cell surface because these molecules would presumably bypass the cis-Golgi en route to the plasma membrane, thus avoiding glycosylation modifications leading to Endo H resistance. However, recent reports showing that Endo H-sensitive molecules represent only a very small minority of the DC surface class I pool argue in favor of the trans-Golgi sorting or recycling models [59,69].

Measuring the relative contributions of direct presentation versus cross-presentation in the natural generation of T cell-mediated antiviral responses has proven a challenge for immunologists. Studies performed with TAP1-knockout mice have shown that TAP1 involvement in cross-priming is often crucial [70–72] but loss of TAP1 affects both direct presentation and cross-presentation pathways by substantially reducing egress of MHC I molecules from the ER and thus drastically decreasing the overall pool of post-Golgi MHC I molecules likely to participate in cross-priming [73]. Using a transgenic mouse model expressing cytoplasmic tyrosine-mutated MHC I molecules, however, it was possible to assess the contribution of cross-priming in the generation of antiviral cell-mediated immune responses in a system that left the direct presentation pathway intact. DCs derived from these mice are defective in cross-presenting the immunodominant ovalbumin peptide and the mice also demonstrate remarkably impaired immunodominant cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) responses towards infection with both Sendai and vesicular stomatitis viruses [49]. These studies support the findings of others in demonstrating the importance of cross-priming in the generation of

antiviral responses [46, 67, 74]. It will be interesting to examine CTL responses against tumors using this transgenic system because the widely accepted notion of DC-dependent T-cell priming predicts that naturally occurring CD8⁺ priming against tumor antigens is likely to be wholly dependent on cross-presentation by DCs [43, 48].

Non-classical MHC I (also called MHC Ib) molecules also contain potential endocytic motifs within their cytoplasmic domains. HLA-E and -F both contain homologous tyrosine-based YXXA motifs (Table 1), suggesting possible implications for their antigen-presentation function. HLA-G, by contrast, contains a truncated cytoplasmic tail that might be an important attribute for its function in maintaining placental tolerance [75]. HLA-H (also known as the hereditary hemochromatosis protein) is not an antigen-presenting molecule but instead binds to, and modulates, the iron-binding affinity of the transferrin receptor (TfR) [76]. Its cytoplasmic YXXA motif (Table 1) might permit trafficking through the endocytic pathway, thereby enabling optimal colocalization with its TfR ligand, whose trafficking is controlled by a similar tyrosine-based sorting signal [77].

### Concluding remarks

This Review presents evidence of an underlying immunological theme in which antigen-presenting molecules expressed by pAPCs use cytoplasmic, endocytic-sorting motifs to gain access to specialized intracellular compartments, where exogenously derived antigens are loaded for presentation to T cells. The importance of priming against exogenous antigens mediated by MHC II molecules has long been known for CD4⁺ T-cell responses and the contribution of crucial endocytic motifs within the Ii chain and class II α and β chains was recognized several years ago. The significance of exogenous antigen presentation mediated by CD1 and MHC I molecules was acknowledged only much more recently, however, the same general principles of endocytic trafficking and antigen acquisition through cytoplasmic endocytic-sorting motifs can be applied. In this context, it should be noted that there are remarkable parallels between the MHC I and CD1 antigen-presentation pathways, particularly with regard to dependence on tyrosine-based cytoplasmic-sorting motifs for intracellular trafficking and exogenous antigen presentation in pAPCs (Figure 1). Although outside the scope of this Review, it should be mentioned that several other molecules involved in exogenous antigen uptake also use endocytic-sorting signals to deliver these antigens to endolysosomal compartments. Pertinent examples include the B-cell receptor Igα chain, Fc receptors and the mannose-6-phosphate receptor [4, 78–80].

The most obvious challenge ahead will be to better characterize the intracellular trafficking pathways and endocytic antigen-loading compartments used by antigen-presenting molecules. Outstanding questions include: are there antigen-loading compartments unique to DCs that might explain the specialized function of these cells in initiating primary immune responses? How much overlap is there between the antigen-loading compartments used by MHC I, II and CD1? All three molecules are known to colocalize with LAMP-1 but are there other molecules that might constitute better markers for distinguishing various endocytic antigen-loading compartments? How do the amino acid sequences of similar endocytic motifs direct trafficking through apparently distinct subcellular compartments, as in the case of the CD1 isoforms? More importantly, how can we use this information to better target antigens to appropriate intracellular compartments in therapeutic settings, such as cancer immunotherapy?

The emergence of endocytic compartments as primary sites of loading for exogenously derived peptide and lipid antigens in pAPCs has certainly provided a major impetus to better define their nature. The morphological and molecular changes that occur during DC maturation suggest that it will be a major challenge to identify and characterize distinct intracellular compartments within what is probably an extremely dynamic endocytic system. However, the accumulating evidence showing that antigen processing within these compartments is key to the generation of T cell-mediated immunity argues that the effort will be well worth it, promising to generate new tales of wonder.
