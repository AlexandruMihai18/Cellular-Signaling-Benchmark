Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a significant global pathogen, infecting more than 240 million people worldwide. While treatment for HBV has improved, HBV patients often require lifelong therapies and cure is still a challenging goal. Recent advances in technologies and pharmaceutical sciences have heralded a new horizon of innovative therapeutic approaches that are bringing us closer to the possibility of a functional cure of chronic HBV infection. In this article, we review the current state of science in HBV therapy and highlight new and exciting therapeutic strategies spurred by recent scientific advances. Some of these therapies have already entered into clinical phase, and we will likely see more of them moving along the development pipeline. **Conclusion:** With growing interest in developing and efforts to develop more effective therapies for HBV, the challenging goal of a cure may be well within reach in the near future. (HEPATOLOGY 2015;62:1893-1908)

Despite the availability of effective vaccines for three decades and improvement of treatment, the prevalence of chronic hepatitis B viral (HBV) infection worldwide has declined minimally from 4.2% in 1990 to 3.7% in 2005.¹ Moreover, the actual number of persons who are chronically infected is estimated to have increased slightly from 223 million to 240 million during this same period. Treatment for this infection, while advancing to the stage that viral replication can be effectively suppressed and disease successfully controlled, is still handicapped by various limitations and cannot be considered as curative. Recognizing that HBV therapeutics is at the cusp of innovations and breakthroughs, this review summarizes new targets among the HBV viral and host immune systems for which drugs are now in late preclinical development and clinical testing. In addition, novel and potentially promising therapeutic strategies that would likely result in more durable and complete responses are highlighted. To put these advances in the context of the current state of the science, we summarize the current HBV therapies and their limitations and spotlight the continued impact of fundamental scientific discoveries in advancing the research and development of new HBV therapies.

## Natural History of Chronic Hepatitis B

The course of chronic HBV infection has been grouped into four phases: the immune tolerant phase, the immune active/hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive chronic hepatitis phase, the HBeAg-negative inactive phase, and the immune active/HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis phase. However, these terms may not accurately reflect the immunological status of patients in each phase but are useful for prognosis and determining need for therapy.²,³ The duration of each phase varies

from months to decades. Transition can occur from an earlier to a later phase, but regression back to an earlier phase can also occur.⁴ It should be noted that not all patients go through all four phases. Furthermore, while the cutoff levels of alanine aminotransferase used to define different phases were traditionally based on upper limits of normal determined by clinical diagnostic laboratories, recent studies suggest that the true normal values are lower.⁵

# HBV Replication: From Basic Science to Drug Development

Advances in understanding the molecular biology and replication cycle of HBV have provided unprecedented insight into the mechanisms of action and treatment response of currently available drugs against HBV as well as potential future targets for therapeutic development (Fig. 1). HBV gains entry into hepatocytes initially through a low-affinity interaction between heparan sulfate proteoglycans on the hepatocytes involving the antigenic loop ("a" determinant or antibody neutralization domain) of the HBV envelope proteins⁶,⁷ and then a high-affinity interaction of the myristoylated pre-S1 domain with the liver-specific receptor sodium/taurocholate cotransporter (NTCP).⁸ NTCP is exclusively expressed on the basolateral/sinusoidal membrane of hepatocytes. Its natural function is to transport conjugated bile salts (e.g., taurocholate) into hepatocytes as part of the enterohepatic pathway.⁹ Accordingly, NTCP plays a key role in the liver tropism of HBV.¹⁰,¹¹ NTCP is also crucial for the host specificity of HBV. Two short sequence motifs within NTCP are sufficient to render the respective proteins from cynomolgus monkey and mouse functioning as an HBV receptor.¹²,¹³ Additional host factors are probably required for efficient HBV entry. Fusion of HBV particles and release of nucleocapsids into the cells involves receptor-mediated endocytosis.¹⁴,¹⁵ The HBV genome-containing nucleocapsid is transported into the nucleus through a yet-undefined path-

way, probably involving microtubule and nuclear importin machinery.¹⁶ In the nucleus, the relaxed circular, partially double-stranded genome is then repaired to a full-length, circular DNA by covalently attached viral polymerase (P) and other incompletely understood mechanisms probably involving tyrosyl DNA phosphodiesterase of the topoisomerase and DNA repair pathway.¹⁷ The circularized protein-free genome then complexes with host histone and nonhistone proteins including various histone-modifying enzymes into a minichromosome that functions as the template for transcription.¹⁸ Its transcriptional activity is regulated by epigenetic modifications and specific host transcriptional factors, such as hepatocyte nuclear factor 4.¹⁹ HBV core and X proteins are also present on the minichromosome and probably play an important role in HBV transcription.¹⁸,²⁰,²¹ The covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) is transcribed to three classes of HBV RNAs: genome-length RNAs (pregenomic and precore RNAs coding for core gene products and P protein), S RNAs (S proteins), and X RNA (HBx protein). The pregenomic RNA transcript is reverse-transcribed by the P protein to relaxed circular DNA in the core-containing nucleocapsid. The nucleocapsid can either assemble into an infectious virion with the envelope proteins through the multivesicular body pathway²² or recycle back to the nucleus for cccDNA amplification in a process probably controlled by the pre-S1 envelope protein and other host factors.²³ The steady-state population of cccDNA is about one to 10 molecules per infected hepatocyte.²⁴

## Current Therapies of Hepatitis B and Mechanisms of Action

There are currently two classes of drugs approved for the treatment of hepatitis B: nucleos(t)ide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and interferon-α (IFN-α). The first-line antiviral HBV medications include a nucleoside analogue, entecavir; a nucleotide analogue, tenofovir; and pegylated IFN-α (PEG-IFN-α), used as

monotherapy.²⁵⁻²⁷ PEG-IFN is administered for 48-52 weeks. While it has a weaker antiviral activity than NRTIs, it is associated with a higher rate of HBeAg and hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) loss, possibly through a combination of direct antiviral and immunomodulatory effects. By contrast, NRTIs target only the reverse-transcription of pregenomic RNA to HBV DNA and have no direct effect on cccDNA. Long-term treatment with more potent NRTIs can lead to progressive loss of HBeAg and HBsAg with time.

IFN-α, as a front-line host defense against viral infections, is known to induce IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), which have promiscuous antiviral functions against a variety of viruses. Depending on the viruses, these ISGs play a diverse and pleiotropic role in targeting various viral functions at different steps of the viral replication cycle and potently suppress viral infection and spread. IFN-α has a direct anti-HBV effect and acts on multiple steps of the HBV replication cycle (Fig. 1).²⁸,²⁹ In addition, it has an immunomodulatory effect that can indirectly inhibit HBV replication by affecting cell-mediated immunity *in vivo*.³⁰ Studies of the HBV kinetics in IFN-α-treated patients suggest a more relevant role of the latter mechanism in mediating IFN-α's anti-HBV effects.³¹

Despite targeting multiple steps of HBV replication, the molecular mechanisms underlying IFN-α's action remain to be fully defined. IFN-α is thought to induce specific ISGs that inhibit HBV transcription or prevent the formation of nucleocapsid or target it for degradation.²⁸,²⁹,³² The responsible ISGs have not been clearly defined. IFN-α's effect on HBV transcription is partly mediated by epigenetic modifications of the cccDNA minichromosome.³³ Recent development of infectious HBV cell culture systems provided the much needed tools and models to study the effects of antivirals, including IFN, on HBV replication.³³,³⁴ A recent study demonstrated that IFN-α and another putative antiviral cytokine, lymphotoxin-β, induce the degradation of cccDNA in infectious cell culture systems.³⁵ This effect
is mediated by induction of the APOBEC3 family of proteins, specifically APOBEC3A by IFN-α and APO-BEC3B by lymphotoxin-β; APOBEC3 functions to restrict foreign DNAs, such as those from invading microbial genomes, which activate the IFN response including induction of APOBEC3s as ISGs.³⁶ The APOBEC3s are DNA editing enzymes and deaminate foreign double-stranded DNA cytidines to uridines.³⁶ This conversion can lead to either C to T mutations or degradation of foreign DNA. In contrast, cellular genomic DNA is unaffected. APOBEC3s are known to target human immunodeficiency virus, adeno-associated virus, and possibly other DNA viral genomes for degradation.³⁶ For HBV, the role of APOBEC3 has been controversial. APOBEC3G was shown to inhibit HBV replication in cell culture, but the mechanism had been attributed to either direct inhibition of HBV replication or hypermutations from DNA editing.³⁷⁻⁴⁰ All of the earlier studies were performed in HBV DNA transfection systems that could not be used to investigate cccDNA. In an HBV infectious culture system, the induced APOBEC3 interacted with the core protein and translocated to the nucleus to target cccDNA.³⁵

The development of nucleoside analogues owes much of its success to the comprehensive understanding of how HBV replicates. Based on the model of HBV replication, the P protein has been the primary therapeutic target in HBV drug development (Fig. 1). While this advance represents a pivotal step in the chronicle of HBV treatment, knowledge of the mechanism of action of this class of anti-HBV drugs also exposes its limitation, as discussed above.

While the second-generation NRTIs, such as entecavir and tenofovir, can potently suppress the DNA synthesis step of HBV replication, they have little effect on the level and activity of cccDNA, which has a long half-life and can persist for decades in the infected liver despite successful antiviral treatment.²⁴ This limitation explains the necessity for a prolonged, possibly indefinite, treatment with this class of anti-HBV drugs. The turnover of cccDNA has been the subject of intense research because of its fundamental importance in HBV replication and therapy. Several mechanisms appear to explain the turnover of cccDNA *in vivo*. First, the direct cytopathic effect of activated HBV-specific T lymphocytes can cause death of infected cells. Second, gradual loss of the cccDNA pool by cell proliferation in injured liver can account partly for gradual loss of cccDNA. Finally, a noncytopathic mechanism of eliminating cccDNA from infected cells contributes to the turnover of cccDNA.⁴¹ IFNs and other cytokines have been

implicated in this “cell cure” mechanism, but the precise mechanism is unknown.⁴¹

Entecavir and tenofovir can decrease the level of HBV DNA by 6 logs within 1 year of treatment and have low rates of antiviral drug resistance (0%-1% after 5 years of continued treatment).⁴²⁻⁴⁴ However, rates of HBeAg seroconversion (~20% after 1 year and 40%-50% after 5 years) and HBsAg loss (5%-10% after 5 years) are low. Therefore, most patients require many years and often lifelong treatment with associated costs and risks of adverse reactions, drug resistance, and nonadherence.⁴⁵ Despite these limitations, antiviral treatment can reverse liver fibrosis and even cirrhosis, prevent cirrhosis complications, and reduce, though not eliminate, the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma.⁴⁴,⁴⁶ Derivatives of tenofovir as prodrugs with improved pharmacological properties are being developed and may be of benefit in certain situations.⁴⁷

For patients who do not have cirrhosis or do not require immunosuppressive therapy, professional society guidelines recommend treating those in the immune active phase,²⁵⁻²⁷ although treatment at an earlier stage has been proposed to minimize unrecognized yet significant liver damage.⁴⁸ However, treatment during the immune tolerant phase is associated with a low rate of HBeAg seroconversion and failure to completely suppress HBV DNA to nondetectable levels.⁴⁹

The ultimate goal of antiviral therapy would be to eliminate all forms of potentially replicating HBV, but this may not be feasible because even in persons who recover from acute HBV infection with HBsAg to antibody to HBsAg (anti-HBs) seroconversion, HBV persists in the liver in the form of cccDNA and can be reactivated during immunosuppressive therapy. A more realistic goal is a “functional cure” in which HBV DNA is not detectable after the completion of a finite course of treatment with loss of HBsAg and minimization of hepatocellular carcinoma risk over time. To accomplish this goal, a combination of antiviral drugs that target different steps in the HBV life cycle or immunomodulatory therapies to restore host immune response to HBV will be needed.

## Combination Studies of Current Therapies

Given that only two classes of anti-HBV agents are currently available, combination therapy consists of two NRTIs or an NRTI plus PEG-IFN. In the latter case, an NRTI and PEG-IFN may be combined simultaneously, sequentially, starting with either drug first, or as an add-on strategy with either drug first.Initially, the clinical need to increase the potency of first-generation antivirals and to prevent emergence of antiviral resistance was the primary reason to test combination therapy with NRTIs. Unfortunately, this approach suffered from the fact that all NRTIs have the same virological target, the HBV polymerase. Thus, the treatment response observed in patients was similar to that of the most potent agent in the combination. The issue of antiviral resistance is now greatly diminished with the development of second-generation NRTIs, such as entecavir and tenofovir. The efficacy and safety of entecavir and tenofovir combination therapy were compared to entecavir monotherapy in previously untreated HBV patients.⁵⁰ A greater proportion of subjects receiving combination therapy achieved viral suppression compared to entecavir alone, but the difference was not statistically significant.⁵⁰ However, HBeAg-positive subjects with baseline HBV DNA ≥10⁸ IU/mL receiving combination therapy had a significantly higher rate of virological response compared to those receiving monotherapy.⁵⁰

Conceptually, combination of PEG-IFN with an NRTI would be more likely to result in synergy because the drugs have different mechanisms of action, the concept being that inhibition of viral replication with an NRTI may augment the immune effects of PEG-IFN. Unfortunately, while studies of PEG-IFN in combination with first-generation NRTIs did show synergy in achieving viral suppression and reducing the incidence of antiviral resistance, off-treatment responses were similar to that of PEG-IFN alone.⁵¹,⁵² The availability of more potent, second-line NRTIs together with a renewed interest in achieving HBsAg clearance has stimulated interest in combining these agents together or in combination with PEG-IFN.

Simultaneous PEG-IFN and tenofovir was evaluated in treatment-naive patients with HBeAg-positive and HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B.⁴³ Patients receiving PEG-IFN and tenofovir had a higher rate of HBsAg loss than those receiving either drug along.⁴³ Although these results are encouraging, they represent a small increase (6%) in HBsAg loss over PEG-IFN monotherapy, and a benefit was mainly observed in those with genotype A infection.

Sequential therapy beginning either with an NRTI followed by PEG-IFN or vice versa for variable durations has been conducted in both HBeAg-positive and HBeAg-negative subjects. In general, these studies have not demonstrated a substantial benefit in terms of either on-treatment or sustained off-treatment HBV DNA suppression or HBeAg and HBsAg loss compared to PEG-IFN as a historical control.⁵³⁻⁵⁵

Starting with NRTI first and adding PEG-IFN later would seem to be the most logical approach to combination therapy. The idea is that the NRTI would rapidly lower viral load and restore T-cell responsiveness, then adding PEG-IFN might hasten the decline of circulating and intrahepatic viral antigens leading to an improvement in the innate immune response.⁵⁶ Several recent studies seem to support such an approach.⁵⁷⁻⁵⁹ Among HBeAg-positive subjects, higher rates of HBeAg seroconversion were achieved with add-on combination therapy of PEG-IFN and NRTI (27%) compared to NRTI only (0%).⁵⁸ Among HBeAg-negative subjects, HBsAg loss was reported in 6.6% of subjects at the end of therapy in the combination arm versus 1% in the NRTI-only arm.⁵⁹ None of these studies included an arm using PEG-IFN monotherapy, and when compared to historical studies of PEG-IFN monotherapy, the results obtained with combination therapy are comparable.

A recent study compared PEG-IFN alone to PEG-IFN followed by add-on entecavir or entecavir followed by add-on PEG-IFN.⁶⁰ Rates of HBeAg seroconversion posttreatment were similar across treatment groups.⁶⁰ With an add-on strategy, a longer duration of NRTI before add-on PEG-IFN and a longer duration of PEG-IFN therapy was associated with higher rates of HBeAg and HBsAg loss.

In summary, there are insufficient data at present to recommend the use of combination therapy except in very special circumstances, such as in subjects with very high baseline viral levels (>10⁸ IU/mL) or for management of subjects who have failed a first-line agent due to a suboptimal response or the development of multidrug resistance. Further studies are needed to address the benefit of various formats of combination therapy with PEG-IFN and more potent NRTIs.

### HBV Entry Inhibitors

Entry inhibitors have been used successfully in treating viral infections. In particular, small molecules and antibody-based treatments are quite effective in treating acute viral infections.⁶¹ For chronic viral infection like human immunodeficiency virus, entry inhibitors have also been successfully developed.⁶² For HBV, entry inhibitors can be applied in two ways. The first is in a preventive setting: entry inhibition, such as using anti-HBs antibodies, blocks *de novo* HBV infection. This application has been successfully demonstrated in animal models⁶³ and is clinically a standard of care using HBsAg-specific immunoglobulins to prevent reinfection after liver transplantation, to avoid vertical transmission
of HBV from infected mothers to children, and for postexposure prophylaxis.⁶⁴ Regarding chronic hepatitis B patients, whether entry inhibition would be a viable therapeutic option is debatable. It is conceivable that potent blockade of HBV reinfection in chronically infected patients can reduce viral load due to the turnover of HBV-infected hepatocytes.⁶⁵ Previous studies suggested that hepatocyte turnover is indeed much faster in HBV-infected liver than in healthy hepatocytes because of immune-mediated cytotoxicity.⁶⁶ A sustained inhibition of *de novo* formation of cccDNA in hepatocytes may contribute to the eventual clearance of the virus with prolonged therapy, especially if it is used in combination with other potent anti-HBV drugs. Because hepatitis D virus shares the same entry pathway, another potential application of entry inhibitors is in HBV/hepatitis D virus coinfection.

HBV entry depends in part on the pre-S1 sequence, more specifically the myristoylated N terminus of the large envelope protein. Both the myristoylation and the N-terminal 75 amino acids are required for infectivity of HBV.⁶⁷,⁶⁸ It was shown that synthetic lipopeptides representing this subdomain potently inhibit HBV infection. The mode of action of such peptidic inhibitors (Myrcludex B, for example) can be attributed to specific receptor binding.¹¹ Myrcludex B successfully passed phase 1 clinical trials.⁶⁹ Moreover, because the natural role of NTCP as a bile salt transporter has been studied in some detail, molecules already known to bind or inhibit the function of NTCP have been tested. Cyclosporin A and its derivatives (e.g., alisporivir) or approved drugs like ezetimibe are among those that have been demonstrated to inhibit HBV entry.⁷⁰⁻⁷²

Myrcludex B, cyclosporin A, and other substrate analogues inhibit bile salt transport by NTCP. Accordingly, these molecules may elevate bile salts and other transported substrates in the serum of patients. This concern may be a clinically manageable problem. First, people with polymorphisms in NTCP resulting in a functional knockdown show very moderate clinical symptoms and do not develop any specific pathology.⁷³ Second, NTCP knockout mice are viable and show elevated conjugated bile salt levels without symptoms but have a slight retardation in growth during development.⁷⁴ Most importantly, the antiviral effect of Myrcludex B and cyclosporin A is already apparent at a much lower concentration than that required for inhibiting bile acid transport (>100-fold difference).¹²,⁷¹ Thus, entry inhibition should be clinically achievable without significant interference with the transporter function of the receptor.

Myrcludex B is currently being tested in two ongoing clinical trials.⁷⁵ Preliminary results suggested that Myr-

cludex B is safe and well tolerated in HBsAg-positive patients with or without HDV coinfection. A decline in the HBV DNA level (>1 log₁₀) was reported in 87% of patients at 12 weeks of treatment (10 mg/day), and the decline continued with extended treatment beyond 12 weeks. Myrcludex B treatment at high doses was associated with some bile acid elevation.

### HBV Capsid Inhibitors

Several classes of inhibitors of pregenomic RNA packaging and HBV capsid assembly have been identified. They function to dysregulate or selectively inhibit either pregenomic RNA encapsidation or nucleocapsid assembly or both. The first of these were the phenylpropenamide derivatives AT-61 and AT-130.⁷⁶ These compounds selectively inhibit viral pregenomic RNA packaging⁷⁷ and are active against both wild-type and lamivudine-resistant HBV.⁷⁸,⁷⁹ As a class and at the molecular level, these agents have been shown to induce tertiary and quaternary structural changes in HBV capsids. AT-130 binds to a promiscuous pocket at the core dimer-dimer interface.⁸⁰ This binding decreases viral production by initiating virion assembly prematurely in the replication cycle, resulting in morphologically normal capsids that are empty and noninfectious.⁷⁷

The second group of inhibitors is the heteroaryldihydropyrimidines, which inhibit HBV virion production *in vitro* and *in vivo* by preventing capsid formation.⁸¹ The best studied of the heteroaryldihydropyrimidines, Bay 41-4109, has a dual mechanism of action by inhibiting encapsidation directly and causing a concomitant reduction in the half-life of the core protein. Structural studies of this class of inhibitors revealed that they induce inappropriate capsid assembly at low concentrations and, when in excess, promote a misdirected assembly reaction and decreased capsid stability.⁸²,⁸³ Like the phenylpropenamides, the heteroaryldihydropyrimidines are active against NRTI-resistant strains of HBV.⁷⁹

Other inhibitors targeting the nucleocapsid are being developed by several biotech companies (Tables 1).⁸⁴ *In vitro* studies have demonstrated strong synergy when these inhibitors are used in combination with currently approved NRTIs.⁷⁸,⁷⁹

### Inhibition of HBV Gene Expression

Persistence of HBV results from an ineffective antiviral immune response against the virus, and one of the ways HBV orchestrates this is through excess production of subviral particles containing HBsAg. These noninfectious subviral particles may act as a decoy for the

immune system, especially for mopping up potentially neutralizing anti-HBs. High levels of HBsAg, in the range of 400 μg/mL (0.4% of total serum protein), are commonly found in the blood of patients with chronic hepatitis B and may interfere with HBV-specific immune responses. A molecular approach to inhibit HBV gene expression has been successfully achieved in vitro using molecule-based therapies targeting the viral messenger RNA. Viral messenger RNA can be directly targeted using antisense oligonucleotides, ribozymes, or RNA interference (RNAi). Of these, RNAi appears most
promising because efficient *in vivo* delivery systems have been developed by a number of biotech companies (Table 1).

RNAi is a process by which small interfering RNA molecules of 21-25 nucleotides induce gene silencing at the posttranscriptional level to effectively knock down the expression of the gene(s) of interest. Such short interfering RNA can lead to transcriptional silencing or translational repression.⁹⁰ These processes are critical in cell growth regulation and tissue differentiation and involve the Drosha and Dicer enzyme complexes, the RNA-induced silencing complex, and the nuclease Argo.⁹⁰ The extensive use of overlapping RNAs and open reading frames within the HBV genome makes for an attractive target for inhibition by RNAi.⁹¹ Both cell culture and mouse model studies have shown that RNAi, delivered as an expression plasmid, is able to inhibit all steps of HBV replication.⁹² In transgenic mice, RNAi expression has been shown to significantly reduce the secretion of HBsAg in serum, reduce both HBV messenger RNAs and genomic DNA in the liver, and eliminate hepatocytes stained positive for core antigen.⁹³ These mouse studies have been extended to a chronically infected chimpanzee.⁹⁴ Currently, a phase 2 placebo-controlled dose-escalation study with the DPC-NAG-ARC-520 formulation has been initiated in HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B whose viremia was controlled by entecavir and showed a 50% drop in HBsAg levels in treated compared to placebo patients.⁹⁵ Another RNAi platform has demonstrated similar success in its preclinical evaluation with a 2.3-log₁₀ reduction in HBsAg in chronically HBV-infected chimpanzees (Alnylam’s company press release).⁹⁶ Other RNAi-based regimens are currently being developed and tested (Table 1).

clevudine (an NRTI) therapy revealed that after more than 6 weeks of therapy, all WHV DNA replicative intermediates were markedly reduced, with the exception of cccDNA, which remained as the predominant viral DNA species in the liver.⁹⁸

Concerning the failure of prolonged NRTI therapy to eradicate cccDNA, one possibility is that the currently available NRTIs do not completely inhibit viral DNA synthesis in every infected hepatocyte *in vivo*, allowing for continuous replenishment of the cccDNA pool through the intracellular amplification pathway. NRTIs are prodrugs requiring activation by host cellular nucleoside kinases, the expression and function of which may be heterogeneous in the liver. Therefore, hepatocytes may have varying abilities to activate the NRTIs, resulting in incomplete inhibition of HBV DNA replication. Emergence of drug-resistance mutations during apparently effective NRTI therapy suggests that residual HBV replication and *de novo* cccDNA synthesis still occur at a low level.⁹⁹

Alternatively, failure to eradicate cccDNA by prolonged NRTI therapy may also be due to the extraordinary stability of cccDNA.¹⁰⁰ cccDNA may persist in a “latent” state amid the host chromosomes and remain as a reservoir for later HBV replication. Healthy hepatocytes in the absence of immune response or inflammatory reaction have a half-life of over 6 months.¹⁰¹,¹⁰²

What we have learned from NRTI therapy is that eradication of cccDNA is essential for the cure of chronic hepatitis B. Combination therapies with NRTIs and one or multiple novel antiviral drugs targeting different steps of HBV replication may completely inhibit HBV DNA replication and thus accelerate the reduction of cccDNA. The other approach would be to directly purge the preexisting cccDNA or permanently silence cccDNA transcription.

A recent strategy to cleave cccDNA molecules or inhibit their transcription by generating cccDNA sequence-specific endonucleases with zinc-finger nucleases, transcription activator-like effector nuclease, or CRISPR/cas9 technology has been tested in cell cultures and a mouse model; but efficient and targeted delivery of these antiviral genes to all HBV-infected cells *in vivo* is a major challenge for clinical application. Another approach is to target the other enzymatic function of HBV polymerase, RNaseH, which is required for HBV replication and cccDNA formation. Recent studies have identified potential inhibitors of HBV RNaseH.¹⁰⁵

Further understanding the molecular mechanism of cccDNA metabolism and functional regulation is essential for identifying and validating molecular targets for

# Inhibitors of HBV cccDNA Formation and Stability

Because the cytoplasmic nucleocapsid DNA is the precursor for cccDNA biosynthesis, complete inhibition of viral DNA replication in the nucleocapsids with polymerase inhibitors should preclude *de novo* cccDNA formation. However, clinical studies demonstrated that although NRTI monotherapy for 48-52 weeks reduced circulating viremia by ~5 log₁₀ and cytoplasmic HBV DNA levels in hepatocytes by approximately 2 log₁₀, reduction of cccDNA was much less pronounced, only by 0.11 to 1.0 log₁₀.²⁴,⁹⁷ Moreover, sequential analyses of viral DNA replicative intermediates and core antigen-positive hepatocytes in the livers of woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV)-infected woodchucks before and during
rational development of antiviral drugs to eradicate or transcriptionally silence cccDNA. As discussed above, recent studies on the molecular mechanism of immune control of HBV infection by IFN-α demonstrated that cccDNA can be specifically targeted for degradation by a cytidine-deamination mechanism^{35} and its transcription can be silenced by epigenetic modification.^{33,106} These findings raise a potentially exciting possibility of targeting cccDNA through pharmacological activation or augmentation of the host intrinsic antiviral pathways. Moreover, investigation into the role and mechanism of HBx and core protein in cccDNA metabolism and function may reveal virus-host interactions for selective elimination or silencing of cccDNA.^{20}

Additional efforts have been made to discover cccDNA-targeting compounds through high-throughput cell-based phenotypic screening. This unbiased approach, while attractive, is currently hampered by a lack of efficient HBV infection cell culture systems and convenient assays for high-throughput quantification of HBV replication and cccDNA quantification. Disubstituted sulfonamides were identified as cccDNA formation inhibitors in a screen of 85,000 small molecular compounds.^{107} The recent rapid progress in the establishment of an efficient HBV infection cell culture system may ultimately allow the development of cell-based assays for high-throughput screening of cccDNA-targeting antivirals.

### Immune Mechanisms of HBV Control and Implications for Therapy

The pathogenesis of chronic HBV infection involves not only viral mechanisms by which HBV establishes a persistent infection but also the host responses to infection. The latter includes the response of hepatocytes to HBV infection as well as the interplay of the virus and infected cells with the other parenchymal and nonparenchymal cells in the liver, i.e., Kupffer cells, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and nonresident immune cells that are recruited to the site of infection. HBV has evolved mechanisms to counteract and escape these different host responses to establish a chronic infection. Recent studies point out a critical role of the liver microenvironment in the elimination or control of HBV (Fig. 2).^{108,109} While much has been learned about the HBV-specific adaptive immunity, the early and innate immune response during acute HBV infection remains largely unknown. In addition, few studies have examined intrahepatic immune responses in patients with chronic HBV infection. Available data suggest impaired responses, but the mechanism of this impairment is unclear.^{109}

In chronic hepatitis B, the antiviral B- and T-cell responses are quantitatively and/or qualitatively defective. For example, anti-HBs is generally undetectable in the setting of excess circulating HBsAg. Furthermore, antiviral T cells show impaired antiviral effector function *in vitro*. However, this host immune response, despite being dysfunctional, exerts at least partial viral control *in vivo* because immune suppression with immunosuppressive therapies results in increased viremia.^{58,110} HBV persistence with antiviral immune dysfunction is also associated with the induction of immune inhibitory pathways including PD-1, CTLA-4, Bim, arginase, and FoxP3⁺ regulatory T cells.^{111-116} These pathways, likely induced in response to continued inflammation, viral replication, and antigen expression, can dampen both cytopathic inflammatory responses as well as noncytopathic antiviral effector functions. Thus, the antiviral effector T-cell function may be enhanced by blocking one or more of these inhibitory pathways,^{112,117} raising the possibility for potential therapeutic application in chronic viral infections such as chronic hepatitis B.

Based on our knowledge of the immune mechanisms of chronic HBV infection, several approaches to restore innate or adaptive immunity or both to control HBV infection in combination with other direct antiviral strategies have been applied.^{108,109} These approaches can be broadly divided into virus-nonspecific and virus-specific modalities. The first involves general immunomodulatory agents, and the latter aims to activate the HBV-specific immune response by applying the technologies of therapeutic vaccination. As discussed above, the efficacy of IFN-α therapy can be partly attributed to its immunostimulatory effect. A promising approach emerges from the field of toll-like receptors (TLRs). Various TLR agonists with potent immunostimulatory effects have been developed.^{118} Their administration to HBV patients leads to both intrahepatic and extrapatic induction of type 1 interferons and other cytokines that may contribute directly to antiviral activity or indirectly result in activation of innate and adaptive immune responses. The second approach involves the blockade of negative immunoregulatory pathways (i.e., coinhibitory signals, inhibitory cytokines, regulatory T cells), which may induce a partial restoration of HBV-specific T cells. Third, engineering of redirected T cells may result in a *de novo* reconstitution of functionally active HBV-specific T cells and activation of heterologous T cells. Whether inhibition of a suppressive effect(s) of HBV can lead to restoration of HBV-specific innate and adaptive immune responses remains a challenging question. Several lines of evidence suggest that HBV

Fig. 2. Innate and adaptive HBV-specific immune responses and immune-based therapeutic development. Immune cells involved in innate and adaptive immune responses activated by HBV infection and their mechanisms of antiviral actions are shown. They are virus-specific CD8⁺ T cells that inhibit viral replication by both direct killing of infected hepatocytes and cytokine-mediated antiviral mechanisms; virus-specific CD4⁺ T cells, which provide essential help for CD8⁺ T-cell priming and effector functions as well as antiviral cytokines; regulatory T cells, which suppress virus-specific T-cell functions; B cells, which mature to plasma cells, producing neutralizing antibodies and potentially participating in antigen presentation; natural killer cells, which display antiviral but also regulatory activity by eliminating activated virus-specific CD8⁺ T cells; natural killer T cells that sense virus-infected hepatocytes, produce antiviral cytokines, and activate adaptive immune responses; other immune cells in the liver that play important roles in the activation and coordination of the innate and adaptive immunities such as Kupffer, myeloid, and plasmacytoid dendritic cells. Therapeutic approaches designed to activate various pathways of the innate and adaptive immunities are illustrated in red. See text for details of these approaches. Abbreviations: CTL, cytotoxic T lymphocyte; DC, dendritic cell; IFNAR, IFN-α receptor; IFNGR, IFN-γ receptor; IFNLR, IFN-λ receptor; JAK/STAT, Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription; Mφ, macrophage; NK, natural killer; NKT, NK T cell; TNF-L, tumor necrosis factor-like molecule (e.g., lymphotoxin-β); TNF-LR, TNF-L receptor; Treg, regulatory T cell.

interferes negatively with these host immune responses. A more detailed understanding of the specific mechanisms is mandatory before new ways of restoring immune responses by targeting virus-specific factors can be explored. HBV-specific strategies may prove more effective and safer than virus-nonspecific approaches.

A concern of the various immunotherapies is the potential risk of autoimmunity and/or exacerbation of liver damage by immune-mediated death of hepatocytes in vivo. Careful consideration of benefit versus risk and close clinical monitoring would be needed in these approaches.

## HBV-Nonspecific Immunomodulatory Agents

### TLR Agonists
The antiviral effect of TLR agonists, particularly TLR-7, through activation of innate immunity has been evaluated in HBV chronically infected chimpanzees and woodchucks. Upon stimulation of TLR-7, plasmacytoid dendritic cells produce IFN-α and
other cytokines/chemokines and induce the activation of natural killer cells and activation of cytotoxic lymphocytes, thereby orchestrating both innate and adaptive immune responses.¹⁹ The altered responsiveness of plasmacytoid dendritic cells may contribute to the reduced innate and adaptive immune responses during chronic viral infections. Agonist-induced activation of TLR-7 therefore represents a novel approach for the treatment of chronic viral infections.¹²⁰ GS-9620, an orally administered agonist of TLR-7, was tested in HBV-infected chimpanzees.¹²¹ Short-term administration of the TLR-7 agonist provided long-term suppression of serum and liver HBV DNA. Serum levels of HBsAg and HBeAg and numbers of HBV antigen-positive hepatocytes were reduced. In parallel, GS-9620 administration induced the production of IFN-α and other cytokines and chemokines, up-regulated ISG expression, and activated natural killer cells and lymphocyte subsets, confirming the activation of TLR-7 signaling. Similar effects were also observed in chronically infected woodchucks. Phase 1 clinical evaluation has been performed, and patients are now being enrolled in a phase 2 trial combining tenofovir and GS-9620 in comparison to tenofovir monotherapy.¹²²

**PD1 and Other Coinhibitory Blockers.** In chronic HBV infection, loss of viral control has been explained by exhausted T cells. One approach would be to recover existing T cells by correcting the balance between coinhibitory (PD1, CTLA-4, Tim-3, Lag-3) and costimulating (41BB, interleukin-12 [IL-12]) signals.¹²³ Recent studies in the field of cancer therapy have highlighted the clinical relevance of PD1 blockade to restore antitumor immunity to improve survival.¹²⁴ As chronic HBV infection and tumor immunology share similar characteristics in terms of immune subversion and the role of PD1, PD1 blockade may be an attractive concept for HBV therapy. A recent study in chronically infected woodchucks tested the combination therapy of entecavir and an anti-PD1 ligand monoclonal antibody together with a WHV DNA vaccine. PD1 blockade was shown to synergize with entecavir and therapeutic vaccination to control viral replication and restore WHV-specific T-cell responses.¹²⁵

### HBV-Specific Modified T Cells

As discussed above, HBV-specific T cells are either exhausted or nonresponsive in chronic HBV infection. This therapeutic approach is designed to provide genetically engineered T cells to target and eliminate HBV-infected hepatocytes. The strategy to genetically modify patient's T cells to express HBV-specific T-cell receptors

and then infuse them into the same patients with HBV-associated hepatocellular carcinoma showed some promise.¹²⁶,¹²⁷ But the variable and major histocompatibility complex-restricted nature of the interaction between T-cell receptor and its ligand and the skepticism that whether one or two such modified T cells would be sufficient to mount an effective T cell-based immune response may limit the clinical application of this approach. The recent emerging technology of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) in the field of cancer therapeutics has been extended to treatment of persistent viral infections.¹²⁸ The CAR approach is to generate a chimeric receptor expressing an extracellular target-binding domain, a hinge and membrane-anchoring region, and one (or more) intracellular signaling domain.¹²⁸ The target-binding domain is derived from the light and heavy chain sequences of a single-chain variable fragment of the immunoglobulin. In the case of HBV, the target could be the cell-surface form of HBsAg and the single-chain variable fragment derived from a construct with high-affinity anti-HBs activity.¹²⁹ The binding of the CAR-modified T cells to HBV-infected hepatocytes can trigger proliferating or activating signals to initiate an effective anti-HBV T-cell response. This strategy has been applied to HBV animal models with some promise.¹³⁰ It remains to be seen whether CAR-modified T cells can achieve a broadly acting and potent anti-HBV response that is sufficient for viral clearance in chronic HBV-infected patients.

### Therapeutic Vaccines

The goal for therapeutic vaccination in chronic hepatitis B is to induce sufficient anti-HBV immune responses to eliminate and/or cure infected hepatocytes without undue host cell damage, prevent viral spread to new hepatocytes, and promote long-term viral control. These approaches leverage our accumulating knowledge of the adaptive immune responses of HBV infection and focus on restoring or activating endogenous HBV-specific immune responses that initially targeted HBsAg and later expanded to other HBV antigens using recombinant proteins, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte epitope vaccine, viral vectors, and DNA vaccination. These vaccines are being combined with antiviral drugs and immune modulators to maximize their effects. An intriguing strategy to personalize antigen presentation to induce anti-HBV immune response involving monocytes has been recently proposed.¹³¹

#### HBsAg-Based Vaccine. Because HBsAg-based prophylactic vaccine can induce protective virus-neutralizing antibodies, the initial studies involved the
use of HBsAg in small trials, with virological and serological responses in some patients.¹³²,¹³³ Combination of an HBsAg vaccine with lamivudine showed promise initially in smaller studies.¹³⁴ However, no difference in clinical efficacy was shown between vaccinated and control groups despite the induction of vigorous HBsAg-specific cellular and humoral immune responses in a large open-labeled randomized controlled trial of HBV patients receiving 12 doses of recombinant HBsAg and ASO2 adjuvant with 52 weeks of lamivudine.¹³⁵ Similarly, the use of yeast-derived recombinant HBsAg and hepatitis B immune globulin immune complex showed promise in a phase 1/2 study,¹³⁶ but this was not reproduced in a larger phase 3 study.¹³⁷

**Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte Epitope Vaccine.** Immunization with recombinant proteins (e.g., HBsAg) can promote antibody and CD4 helper T-cell responses, but generally not those of CD8 T cells, which require endogenously processed viral peptides. Given the relevance of antiviral CD8 T cells in HBV clearance, direct augmentation of HBV-specific CD8 T cells was attempted in a pilot study using a lipopeptide encoding a single immunogenic human leukocyte antigen A2-restricted HBV core 18-27 CTL epitope.¹³⁸ Despite their immunogenicity in healthy adults, this epitope vaccine was not immunogenic in patients with chronic hepatitis B and did not significantly change the HBV DNA titers or HBeAg status. Inclusion of other epitopes in this approach may be necessary.

**DNA Vaccination With or Without Immunomodulators.** DNA vaccination can promote antiviral CD8 T-cell as well as CD4 T-cell and antibody responses.¹³⁹ In this regard, intramuscular injection of DNA encoding only pre-S2/S was safe, well-tolerated, and at least transiently immunogenic but only marginally effective in reducing HBV DNA levels in a phase 1 study of chronic hepatitis B patients who did not respond to IFN-α and/or lamivudine.¹⁴⁰,¹⁴¹ It also did not prevent viremic relapse in the phase 1/2 ANRS HB02 VAC-AND trial.¹⁴¹ Another phase 1 study using plasmid DNA encoding all HBV open reading frames and human IL-12 in addition to daily lamivudine showed a 50% HBV DNA suppression at 1 year post-treatment cessation.¹⁴² However, in a subsequent larger study, a related HBV plasmid DNA (all HBV open reading frames except HBx) and human IL-12 with daily adefovir showed only a tendency for greater HBeAg loss and HBV DNA suppression compared to adefovir alone.¹⁴³

**Other Therapeutic Vaccine Trials.** Currently, open-label therapeutic HBV vaccine trials on clinicaltrials.gov (as of May 2015) include (1) GS4774, a heat-killed recombinant yeast expressing HBV S, core, and HBx fusion protein;¹⁴⁴ (2) ABX203 with recombinant HBsAg and hepatitis B core antigen in the setting of PEG IFN-α and oral antivirals; (3) INO-1800, a multi-antigen DNA vaccine encoding HBsAg and hepatitis B core antigen electroporated alone or combined with INO-9112 encoding IL-12 in patients on either entecavir or tenofovir; (4) TG1050, a nonreplicative E1/E3-deleted human adenovirus encoding a fusion protein combining modified HBV core, polymerase and envelope; (5) HBV vaccine with hepatitis B immune globulin and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor; (6) HBV vaccine with IFN-α2b and IL-2; (7) HBV vaccine activated dendritic cells combined with PEG IFN-α or nucleos(t)ide analogues; (8) intensified Euvax (HBV S) vaccination with PEG-IFN-α.

### Therapeutic Pipeline and Conclusion

Based on the literature, expert input, publicly disclosed information of various pharmaceutical companies, the clinicaltrial.gov website, we generated a table summarizing the current status of various anti-HBV drugs or biologics in the development pipeline (Table 1). While many of them are still in preclinical development, several have advanced to clinical trials. As discussed above, some of them showed early promise and will likely advance to the late clinical trial phase for more definitive proof of the preliminary success. In this review, we have summarized the major therapeutic approaches and novel molecular targets for anti-HBV drug development and provided a knowledge-based rationale behind these various strategies. It is possible that new and additional technologies may emerge as the field advances. To achieve a more sustained and effective control of HBV infection, a combination of the existing HBV therapies and one or more of the above modalities, either small-molecule drugs or biologics, will be necessary. With the concerted efforts of private and public sectors, the next milestone in the therapy of HBV infection, a functional “cure” that has remained elusive, is likely within our grasp within the next decade.
