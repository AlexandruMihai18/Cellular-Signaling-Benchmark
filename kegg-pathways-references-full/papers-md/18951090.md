## SUMMARY

Forkhead box O (FOXO) transcription factors, the key regulators of cell survival, are negatively controlled through the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. Phosphorylation of FOXO by Akt leads to cytoplasmic localization and subsequent degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Here we show a paradigm of FOXO1 regulation by the protein arginine methyltransferase PRMT1. PRMT1 methylated FOXO1 at conserved Arg248 and Arg250 within a consensus motif for Akt phosphorylation; this methylation directly blocked Akt-mediated phosphorylation of FOXO1 at Ser253 in vitro and in vivo. Silencing of PRMT1 by small interfering RNA enhanced nuclear exclusion, polyubiquitination, and proteasomal degradation of FOXO1. PRMT1 knockdown led to a decrease in oxidative-stress-induced apoptosis depending on the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. Furthermore, stable expression of enzymatic inactive PRMT1 mutant increased resistance to apoptosis, whereas this effect was reversed by expression of phosphorylation-deficient FOXO1. Our findings predict a role for arginine methylation as an inhibitory modification against Akt-mediated phosphorylation.

## INTRODUCTION

The mammalian forkhead transcription factors of class O (FoxO) subfamily consist of FOXO1, FOXO3, FOXO4, and FOXO6 and are involved with a wide range of biological processes, such as apoptosis, cell-cycle control, glucose metabolism, oxidative stress resistance, and longevity (Greer and Brunet, 2005). FOXO proteins are tightly regulated by multiple posttranslational modifications including phosphorylation, acetylation, and ubiquitination (Vogt et al., 2005). A central regulatory mechanism of FOXO proteins is phosphorylation by the serine-threonine kinase

Akt/protein kinase B (Akt/PKB), downstream of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), in response to insulin or several growth factors. Phosphorylation at three conserved residues results in the export of FOXO proteins from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, thereby decreasing expression of FOXO target genes (Brunet et al., 1999; Kops et al., 1999). In addition, Akt-mediated phosphorylation of FOXO leads to their proteasomal degradation through polyubiquitination by the E3 ubiquitin ligase Skp2 (Huang et al., 2005; Matsuzaki et al., 2003).

The status of FOXO modifications is altered under a variety of environmental conditions: nutrient deprivation, oxidative stress, and DNA damage (van der Horst and Burgering, 2007). Among these stress stimuli, oxidative stress has been shown to increase apoptosis, which is coupled with phosphorylation, acetylation, and monoubiquitination of FOXO proteins (Daitoku and Fukamizu, 2007). For example, the oxidative-stress-regulated protein kinase MST1 directly binds to and phosphorylates FOXO proteins and thereby promotes FOXO nuclear translocation, which in turn induces cell death in mammalian neurons (Lehtinen et al., 2006). Meanwhile, upon exposure to oxidative stress, FOXO proteins are also regulated simultaneously by reversible acetylation and monoubiquitination, the modifications of which are implicated in apoptosis, cell-cycle arrest, and resistance to oxidative stress (Brunet et al., 2004; Daitoku et al., 2004; Motta et al., 2004; van der Horst et al., 2004, 2006).

Arginine is a positively charged amino acid known to mediate hydrogen bonding and amino-aromatic interactions. Protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs) are enzymes that catalyze the transfer of a methyl group from S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) to a guanidino nitrogen of arginine (Bedford and Richard, 2005; Boisvert et al., 2005). In humans, the PRMT family has been shown to contain at least 11 methyltransferases, designated as PRMT1-11 based on differences in primary sequence and substrate specificity. PRMT1 is a predominant methyltransferase with a wide substrate spectrum including histone H4, hnRNPs, RNA helicase A, and EWS (Bedford and Richard, 2005; Boisvert et al., 2005; Krause et al., 2007). Recent accumulating evidence has revealed an important role of arginine methylation in manifold cellular processes, including RNA processing, transcriptional regulation, signal transduction, DNA repair, and

protein-protein interactions (Bedford and Richard, 2005; Boisvert et al., 2005). However, the functional consequences of arginine methylation and its mode of regulation remain to be elucidated.

Here we identify the FOXO transcriptional factors as key targets of PRMT1. We demonstrate that PRMT1 methylates FOXO1 primarily at Arg248 and Arg250 that are conserved within the consensus Akt phosphorylation motif. This arginine methylation directly abrogates Akt-induced phosphorylation of FOXO1 at Ser253, which in turn results in increased nuclear localization, and inhibition of subsequent degradation. We also find that oxidative stress augments the extent of FOXO1 methylation, thereby repressing its phosphorylation at Ser253. PRMT1 knockdown reduces oxidative-stress-induced apoptosis depending on the Akt-FOXO1 signaling pathway. Supporting these results, stable expression of enzymatic inactive PRMT1 mutant protects against oxidative-stress-induced apoptosis, while overexpression of phosphorylation-defective FOXO1 mutant counteracts the antiapoptotic effect. Taken together, we provide evidence that arginine methylation serves as an inhibitory modification against Akt-mediated phosphorylation of FOXO1 that regulates responses to oxidative stress in mammalian cells.

## RESULTS

### PRMT1 Interacts with and Methylates FOXO Transcription Factors

Since PRMTs have been shown to methylate and modulate CBP/p300 (Chevillard-Briet et al., 2002; Xu et al., 2001), PGC-1α (Teyssier et al., 2005), and HNF4 (Barrero and Malik, 2006), all of which act as key mediators for FOXO transcription factors (Daitoku et al., 2004; Fukuoka et al., 2003; Hirota et al., 2003; Puigserver et al., 2003), we hypothesized that FOXO proteins might also be regulated by arginine methylation. To ascertain whether members of the PRMT family could regulate FOXO1, we first tested the association between PRMT1 to PRMT6 proteins and FOXO1 in vitro. GST pull-down assays showed that

FOXO1 specifically bound to PRMT1 and PRMT6, both of which are classified as type I enzymes catalyzing the formation of asymmetric dimethylarginine (Figure 1A). We next performed in vitro methylation assays using a series of GST-fused PRMT proteins and immunoprecipitated FLAG-FOXO1. As shown in Figure 1B, PRMT1, but not the other PRMTs including PRMT6, methylated FOXO1 in vitro. To further confirm an in vivo interaction between FOXO1 and PRMT1, coimmunoprecipitation assays were conducted with HEK293T cells. We found that endogenous FOXO1 formed a physical complex with endogenous PRMT1 in cells (Figure 1C). To test whether PRMT1 methylates FOXO1 in vivo, HEK293T cells ectopically expressing FLAG-FOXO1 were transfected with GFP control or PRMT1-specific small interfering RNA (siRNA), and then FLAG immunoprecipitates were analyzed for the extent of de novo methylation. Silencing endogenous PRMT1 markedly decreased FOXO1 methylation, suggesting that FOXO1 can be a substrate for PRMT1 in cells (Figure 1D). Moreover, we examined whether other FOXO transcription factors, FOXO3, FOXO4, and FOXO6, can be also targeted by PRMT1 for methylation. PRMT1 wild-type (WT), but not an enzymatic inactive mutant (mut) that is defective in SAM binding, interacted with and methylated all FOXO family proteins in vitro (Figure 1E and see Figure S1 available online). Taken together, these results suggest that PRMT1 is involved in regulation of FOXO transcription factors through methylation.

### PRMT1 Methylates FOXO1 at Conserved Sites In Vitro and In Vivo

To determine the methylated region in FOXO1, we employed in vitro methylation assays using three fragments of FOXO1: the N terminus (1–207 aa), the middle part (208–409 aa), and the C terminus (410–652 aa) (Figure 2A). Unlike p53 protein, both N-terminal and middle regions of FOXO1 were methylated equivalently by GST-PRMT1 (WT) (Figure 2B). We further attempted to identify the methylated arginine residue(s) in FOXO1. PRMT1 is known to often recognize and methylate arginine residues within glycine-arginine-rich (GAR) motifs, which

are present in many RNA- and DNA-binding proteins (Boisvert et al., 2005), but there is no GAR motif in the entire FOXO1 sequence. We therefore searched for other putative PRMT1-methylation motifs and found that FOXO1 contains four Arg-X-Arg (RXR) sequences (Figure S2A), which exist in several PRMT1 substrates (Smith et al., 1999; Wada et al., 2002). To determine whether the RXR motif is targeted by PRMT1, we initially focused on the C-terminal end of forkhead domain (208–254 aa), including one RXR motif (248-RRR-250; RXR2), and replaced the arginines at Arg248, Arg249, and Arg250 with lysines, either individually or in combination. As expected, the R248K and R250K but not R249K single-site mutations decreased the extent of methylation, and R248K/R250K double mutation exhibited prominent reductions in overall methylation (Figure 2C). Similarly, in the rest of the middle region (251–409 aa, see Figure 2A), two arginines in an RXR motif (311-RPR-313; RXR4) were required for PRMT1-mediated FOXO1 methylation (Figure 2D). Furthermore, 4RK (R248K/R250K/R311K/R313K) substitution in the middle region of FOXO1 (208–409 aa) completely abolished the extent of methylation (Figure S2B), suggesting that the four arginines of RXR2 and RXR4, but not RXR3 (264-RGR-266), are targeted for PRMT1-dependent methylation. In contrast, double RK substitutions at RXR1 (19-RQR-21) did not reduce FOXO1 methylation in the N terminus of FOXO1 (Figure S2C). Instead, we identified Arg29, Arg147, and Arg154 as additional methylation sites for PRMT1, even though these arginines are not included in the RXR motif (Figure 2E).

To elucidate which arginines serve as a primary methylation site(s), further analysis was conducted using the context of full-length FOXO1. As shown in Figure 2F, the R248K/R250K mutant significantly decreased the extent of methylation; mutation of all of the other methylation sites (R29K/R147K/R154K/R311K/R313K; 5RK) did not decrease the methylation compared with the R248K/R250K mutant, suggesting that Arg248 and Arg250 are the major methylation sites of FOXO1 in vitro. Next, to explore whether FOXO1 is methylated at Arg248 and Arg250 in vivo, we generated an anti-methyl-FOXO1 (anti-MeFOXO1) antibody and tested for specificity by dot blot and in vitro methylation assays (Figure S3A and Figure 2G). The anti-MeFOXO1 antibody specifically detected WT, but not the R248K/R250K
mutant of FOXO1 overexpressed in HEK293T cells (Figure S3B). Moreover, the treatment with the methyltransferase inhibitors 5′-deoxy-5′-(methylthio)adenosine (MTA) and adenosine dialdehyde (Adox) robustly reduced signal intensity of methylated FOXO1 (Figure 2H). To address whether endogenous FOXO1 is methylated by PRMT1, HEK293T cells were transfected with GFP control or PRMT1-specific siRNA and then whole-cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-MeFOXO1 antibody. As shown in Figure 2I, knockdown of PRMT1 reduced the extent of FOXO1 methylation in a dose-dependent manner. A decrease in FOXO1 methylation was also observed in stable cells overexpressing PRMT1 (mut) (Figure S4A), which is able to interact with FOXO1 (Figure S4B). In contrast, PRMT6 reduction by siRNA did not decrease but rather increased the extent of FOXO1 methylation (Figure S5). Taken together, these data indicate that endogenous FOXO1 methylation was specifically induced by PRMT1 in vivo.

**Methylation of FOXO1 Blocks Its Phosphorylation by Akt**

The Arg248 and Arg250 residues of mouse FOXO1 are highly conserved among FOXO family members and across species, including mammals, *Drosophila*, and *C. elegans* (Figure 3A). Interestingly, we noticed that these methylation sites overlapped the consensus Akt phosphorylation motif (RXRXXS/T) in FOXO proteins (Figure 3A). We therefore examined the possible interplay between arginine methylation and Akt-dependent phosphorylation by using two FOXO1 peptides spanning residues 241–260: one is unmodified, and the second bears asymmetric dimethylated Arg248 and Arg250 (R248me/R250me). Recombinant Akt readily phosphorylated the unmodified peptide at Ser253, whereas it showed virtually no activity toward the R248me/R250me peptide (Figure 3B), indicating that Akt cannot recognize its consensus motif when the two arginines are methylated. To further test whether methylation of FOXO1 prevents phosphorylation by Akt in vitro, we conducted sequential methylation and phosphorylation assays using GST-FOXO1 (208–409 aa) as substrates. Akt-mediated phosphorylation of FOXO1 at Ser253 was abolished by prior methylation by PRMT1 (Figure 3C, lane 3 versus lane 4). PRMT1-mediated methylation also inhibits phosphorylation with all the FOXO proteins by Akt, suggesting that this may be a general regulatory mechanism for the FOXO transcription factors (Figure 3D). In contrast, prior phosphorylation of FOXO1 had no effect on methylation (Figure 3E, lane 3 versus lane 4). Moreover, most importantly, methylation of two arginine residues in a peptide of cognate Akt consensus sequence (RPRAATF) prevented subsequent phosphorylation by Akt (Figure S6A). Supporting this finding, we demonstrated that the C terminus of PGC-1α, which contains the major and multiple potential phosphorylation sites for Akt (Li et al., 2007), was methylated by PRMT1, and this arginine methylation completely blocked Akt-mediated phosphorylation (Figure S6B, lane 5 versus lane 6). We next examined whether the mutual antagonism between methylation and phosphorylation exists in vivo. Silencing of endogenous PRMT1 led to an increase in human FOXO1 phosphorylation at Ser256, which corresponds to Ser253 in mouse, whereas the increased phosphorylation of FOXO1 declined to a basal level by the overexpression of siRNA-resistant PRMT1 (PRMT1R) (Figure 3F). On the basis of these in vitro and in vivo results, we conclude that FOXO1 phosphorylation at Ser253 through PI3K-Akt signaling is inhibited by PRMT1-mediated methylation at Arg248 and Arg250. On the other hand, methylation of the N-terminal region at Arg29, Arg147, and Arg154 appears not to influence Akt-mediated phosphorylation and transcriptional activity of FOXO1 (Figures S7A and S7B).

**PRMT1 Prevents the Nuclear Export, Polyubiquitination, and Proteasomal Degradation of FOXO1**

Because Akt-mediated phosphorylation, especially at Ser253, leads to the export of FOXO1 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (Zhang et al., 2002), we investigated whether PRMT1 is involved in regulating the intracellular localization of FOXO1. In the presence of fetal bovine serum (FBS), cotransfection of DsRed-fused PRMT1 (WT) resulted in nuclear accumulation of GFP-FOXO1 compared to DsRed control, while cotransfection of DsRed-PRMT1 (mut) caused nuclear exclusion of GFP-FOXO1 in HeLa cells (Figure 4A). Meanwhile, when PI3K-Akt signaling pathway was inhibited by LY294002 treatment, PRMT1 (mut) did not affect the nuclear localization of FOXO1 (Figure 4B). We also observed no change in the distribution of the phosphorylation-resistant mutant FOXO1 (S253A), even when PRMT1 (mut) was coexpressed (Figure S8A), suggesting that PRMT1 (mut)-induced trafficking of FOXO1 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm is entirely dependent on Akt-dependent phosphorylation of FOXO1. Furthermore, immunofluorescence experiments showed that endogenous FOXO1 diffused throughout HepG2 cells in the presence of FBS, whereas reduction of endogenous PRMT1 by siRNA resulted in increased cytoplasmic localization of FOXO1 (Figure 4C). Given that the methyltransferase activity of PRMT1 contributes to the nuclear localization of FOXO1, we predicted that methylated FOXO1 would be localized to the nucleus. As expected, immunostaining with anti-MeFOXO1 antibody showed exclusive nuclear localization of methylated FOXO1; these signals disappeared when the antibody was preblocked with methylated R248/R250, but not nonmethylated peptides (Figure 4D). Moreover, inhibition of methyltransferase activity by MTA/Adox treatment or PRMT1 knockdown caused a marked decrease in nuclear methyl-FOXO1 signals (Figure S8B).

We and others previously reported that Akt-mediated phosphorylation of FOXO1 leads to polyubiquitination and degradation of FOXO1 (Huang et al., 2005; Matsuzaki et al., 2003). To examine the correlation between PRMT1-induced methylation and polyubiquitination of FOXO1, HEK293T cells were transfected with FLAG-FOXO1 and HA-ubiquitin, and cellular methyltransferase activity was inhibited by MTA/Adox treatment. As shown in Figure 4E, polyubiquitinated FOXO1 was detected in the presence of MTA/Adox. In addition, polyubiquitination of endogenous FOXO1 was consistently promoted by PRMT1 knockdown (Figure 4F). We further demonstrated that reduction of endogenous PRMT1 led to a decrease in FOXO1 protein levels, and this effect was completely abrogated by treatment with the proteasome inhibitors MG132, lactacystin, or epoxomicin (Figure 4G). It should be noted that PRMT1 knockdown did not affect the mRNA levels of FOXO1 (Figure S9). Taken together, these

FOXO-responsive elements (HEK293/3xIRS-MLP-luc) (Daitoku et al., 2004). Cotransfection of PRMT1 (WT) and FOXO1 enhanced reporter gene activity compared with FOXO1 alone, whereas cotransfection of PRMT1 (mut) diminished the transcriptional activity of FOXO1 (Figure 5A). To ascertain whether PRMT1 affects FOXO1 function by inhibiting its Akt-induced phosphorylation, HEK293/3xIRS-MLP-luc cells were cotransfected with PRMT1 and a series of phosphorylation-deficient FOXO1 mutants, which are still able to interact with and to be methylated by PRMT1 (Figures S10A and 10B). As shown in Figure 5B, overexpression of PRMT1, both WT and enzymatic inactive mutant, led to only a slight effect on the transcriptional activities of S253A, S253A/S316A, and T24A/S253A/S316A (3A) mutants of FOXO1. These data imply that methyltransferase activity of PRMT1 contributes to the transcriptional activation of FOXO1 by controlling Akt-mediated phosphorylation.

FOXO transcription factors have been shown to induce both stress resistance and cell death upon exposure to oxidative stress in mammalian cells (Brunet et al., 2004; Kops et al., 2002). To explore the role of PRMT1 in adaptive cellular responses to oxidative stress, HEK293 cells transfected with siRNA against GFP, FOXO1, or PRMT1 were treated with hydrogen peroxide, and then cell viabilities were measured. Under conditions of oxidative stress, knockdown of FOXO1 or PRMT1 increased cell viability compared with control siRNA, but double knockdown did not have a synergistic effect on cell viability, indicating that PRMT1 is involved in oxidative-stress-dependent cell death, largely dependent on the function of FOXO1 (Figure 5C). Further, since FOXO factors are known to induce apoptosis by upregulating the Bcl-2-interacting mediator (Bim) (Dijkers et al., 2000; Nakamura and Sakamoto, 2008), we determined Bim gene expression when FOXO1 or PRMT1 was reduced. Quantitative RT-PCR showed that mRNA levels of Bim were decreased by approximately 50% in both FOXO1 and PRMT1 knockdown cells (Figure 5D). Additionally, silencing of PRMT1 reduced simultaneously with the amounts of FOXO1 and BIM proteins (Figure 5E). These data suggest that PRMT1 enhances the BIM gene expression by stabilizing FOXO1 protein.

**Oxidative Stress Induces Methylation of FOXO1**

Based on our findings that PRMT1 is involved in cellular responses to oxidative stress, we determined whether oxidative stress alters the PRMT1-mediated FOXO1 methylation. Methylation of FOXO1 was induced by hydrogen peroxide in HEK293T cells (Figure 6A). Hydrogen peroxide also facilitated the interaction of endogenous PRMT1 and FOXO1 (Figure 6B), supporting the possibility that FOXO1 may be an important substrate of PRMT1 in response to oxidative stress. Conversely, phosphorylation of endogenous FOXO1 at an Akt-targeted Ser256 (Ser253 in mouse) gradually diminished during the conditions of oxidative stress (Figure 6C). The immunostaining experiments revealed that knockdown of PRMT1 prevented the oxidative-stress-induced translocation of FOXO1 from the cytoplasm to the

nucleus (Figure 6D). Overall, these data support the conclusion that oxidative stress augments PRMT1-induced FOXO1 methylation, thereby inhibiting its phosphorylation by Akt.

### PRMT1 Mediates Oxidative-Stress-Induced Apoptosis via FOXO1

Next, we investigated whether PRMT1 modulates the cellular response to oxidative stress through the inhibition of Akt-induced FOXO1 phosphorylation. Consistent with result in Figure 5C, PRMT1 knockdown repressed oxidative-stress-induced apoptosis (Figure 7A, column 1 versus column 3), whereas blockade of PI3K-Akt signaling by LY294002 treatment abolished the antiapoptotic effect by PRMT1 reduction (Figure 7A, column 3 versus column 4). In addition, the effect of LY294002 treatment was completely suppressed by silencing both PRMT1 and FOXO1 (Figure 7A, column 4 versus column 6). These results suggest that the proapoptotic effect of PRMT1 under oxidative stress is largely due to the inhibition of FOXO1 phosphorylation via PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. To further clarify the correlation between methylation and phosphorylation of FOXO1 in the apoptotic response to oxidative stress, PRMT1 knockdown or HEK293/PRMT1 (mut) stable cells were transfected with WT or phosphorylation-deficient (3A) mutants of FOXO1 following treatment with hydrogen peroxide. The PRMT1 (mut) stable cells exhibited prominent resistance to oxidative-stress-induced apoptosis comparable to that of PRMT1 knockdown; furthermore,

unlike FOXO1 (WT), overexpression of FOXO1 (3A) mutant restored oxidative-stress-induced apoptosis in both PRMT1 (mut) stable and PRMT1 knockdown cells (Figures 7B and 7C). Thus, we conclude that PRMT1 promotes cell death under conditions of oxidative stress depending on FOXO1 methylation, which inhibits its phosphorylation via PI3K-Akt signaling pathway.

### DISCUSSION

In this study, we demonstrate the direct and functional crosstalk between arginine methylation and phosphorylation of FOXO1 (see model, Figure 7D). We show that PRMT1 directly binds to and methylates FOXO1 primarily at the conserved arginine residues overlapping within the Akt phosphorylation consensus motif in vitro and in vivo. The arginine methylation of FOXO1 precludes its phosphorylation by Akt, thereby leading to the nuclear accumulation of FOXO1, which in turn increases oxidative-stress-induced apoptosis by activating expression of Bim gene. Remarkably, the crosstalk of arginine methylation and Akt-mediated phosphorylation of FOXO1 was also observed in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) (Figures S11A–S11D). Furthermore, we present evidence that knockdown of PRMT1, as well as of FOXO family members, induces expression of eNOS protein in HUVECs (Figure S12). Given that FOXO1 and FOXO3 repress the eNOS expression by

PRMT1 Regulates FOXO by Arginine Methylation

Figure 7. PRMT1 Is Involved in Oxidative-Stress-Induced Apoptosis Depending on FOXO1 Activity

(A) HEK293 cells transfected with siRNAs against GFP, PRMT1, or both PRMT1 and FOXO1 were treated with H₂O₂ (200 μM) in the presence or absence of LY294002 (20 μM) for 12 hr. Apoptotic cells were detected by APOPercentage Dye labeling. Data are presented as percentage normalized to the total cell count in each lane, set at 100%. Error bars indicate ±SD of six repeats from three independent experiments; *p < 0.001 between control (lane 3) and LY (lane 4).

(B) HEK293 cells were transfected with siRNAs against GFP or PRMT1 together with empty, FOXO1 (WT), or FOXO1 (3A) expression vectors and then treated with H₂O₂ (200 μM) for 12 hr. Apoptotic cells were analyzed as in (A). Error bars indicate ±SD of triplicate repeats from three independent experiments; *p < 0.001 between FOXO1 (3A) (lane 6) and empty or FOXO1 (WT) (lane 4 or 5).

(C) HEK293 cells or stable cell lines expressing PRMT1 (mut) were transfected with an empty, FOXO1 (WT), or FOXO1 (3A) expression vectors and then treated with H₂O₂ (200 μM) for 12 hr. Apoptotic cells were analyzed as in (A). Error bars indicate ±SD of triplicate repeats from three independent experiments; *p < 0.001 between FOXO1 (3A) (lane 6) and empty or FOXO1 (WT) (lane 4 or 5).

(D) Model for PRMT1-regulated FOXO1 function.

RXR1 (19-RQR-21), which comprises an Akt phosphorylation consensus sequence, is not methylated by PRMT1. These results indicate that, although PRMT1 indeed defines RXR motif as a preferred methylation consensus sequence, it also requires a higher degree of specificity for substrate recognition. Thus, more substrates containing a RXR motif(s) need to be identified to define an accurate methylation consensus sequence.

Recent evidence showed two functional modes of PRMT1 in HNF4-dependent transcriptional activation, namely by directly modulating its binding to DNA and by affecting histone H4 methylation on the promoters of target genes (Barrero and Malik, 2006). In our ChIP experiments, PRMT1, as well as methylated FOXO1, was recruited to an artificial promoter containing FOXO-binding sites (Figure S13), implying that PRMT1 may serve as a transcriptional cofactor of FOXO1, probably by methylating histones and acting synergistically with other FOXO1 cofactors, such as CBP/p300 and PGC-1α. However, since PRMT1 was unable to enhance the transcriptional activities of phosphorylation-deficient FOXO1 (Figure 5B), we consider that PRMT1-mediated transactivation is mainly due to inhibition of FOXO1 phosphorylation by Akt.

Oxidative stress has been shown to induce nuclear localization of FOXO proteins even in the presence of growth factors. In mammalian neurons, oxidative stress activates the protein kinase MST1, which in turn phosphorylates FOXO3 at a conserved site within the forkhead domain and promotes the nuclear translocation of FOXO3 by disrupting FOXO's interaction with 14-3-3 proteins, thereby inducing neuronal cell death (Lehtinen et al., 2006). Alternatively, in response to oxidative stress,

monoubiquitination of FOXO4 occurs rapidly and transiently by unknown E3 ligase and the deubiquitinating enzyme USP7/HAUSP, resulting in its nuclear localization and transcriptional activation (van der Horst et al., 2006). However, the functional consequences of Akt-mediated phosphorylation under increased cellular oxidative stress are largely unknown. Notably, a recent study showed that the serine/threonine phosphatase PP2A associates with and dephosphorylates FOXO1 in cells and controls its proapoptotic activity by regulating the expression of BIM protein (Yan et al., 2008). Considering these findings together with our present study, we propose a model of FOXO regulation via multiple posttranslational modifications. Upon oxidative stress, monoubiquitination and/or MST1-induced phosphorylation initially promote FOXO nuclear translocation by opposing the PI3K-Akt signaling regulation. In the nucleus, USP7 deubiquitates FOXO proteins, and moreover, PP2A could dephosphorylate FOXO, presumably not only at the Akt phosphorylation sites but also at the MST1-mediated site. Although dephosphorylated FOXO proteins are available for another round of nuclear exclusion by Akt-mediated phosphorylation, preexisting arginine methylation by PRMT1 prevents the subsequent phosphorylation and thereby results in its long-lasting retention in the nucleus, leading to oxidative-stress-induced cell death.

Mutual effects of different posttranslational modifications in histones have been established as “histone code” (Strahl and Allis, 2000). For example, phosphorylation of histone H3 on Ser10 prevents methylation of H3-Lys9 by the lysine methyltransferase Suv39h1 (Rea et al., 2000). Our findings now show an opposite interplay in a nonhistone protein, in which Akt-dependent phosphorylation of FOXO1 is blocked by arginine methylation within a putative Akt consensus sequence. Importantly, we demonstrated that the functional crosstalk between arginine methylation and phosphorylation could be extended to another Akt substrate PGC-1α. Given that Akt has a wide range of downstream targets, which regulate cell-cycle progression, cell survival, glucose metabolism, and stress resistance (Lawlor and Alessi, 2001), PRMT1-mediated arginine methylation may add an additional dimension to the signal transduction cascades that regulate tumorigenesis, diabetes, and longevity.


### Cell Viability and Apoptosis Assays

Relative cell viability was measured by 2-(2-methoxy-4-nitrophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenyl)-5-(2,4-disulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, monosodium salt (WST-8) assay using Cell Counting Kit-8 (Dojindo). After transfection with siRNAs, HEK293 cells were incubated for 72 hr, and 1/10 volume (100 μl) of the cell suspension was incubated with 10 μl of WST-8 solution in a 96-well plate for 2 hr at 37°C. Absorbance of the samples at 450 nm wavelength was measured by an Ultramark microplate reader (Bio-Rad). Detection of apoptotic cells was performed with the APOPPercentage apoptosis assay kit (Biocolor) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The levels of apoptosis were quantified by counting digital images of APOPPercentage Dye-labeled cells. An average of three independent counts for each sample point was performed. A minimum of 200 cells per condition was counted.

### EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES

#### siRNA Transfection

siRNAs for human FOXO1 (5′-AGUUCAUUCGUGUGUCAGAA-3′), human FOXO family members (FOXOs) (5′-GCGUGCCCUCACUUCAGGA-3′), human PRMT1 (5′-GGACAUGACAUCCAAAGAU-3′), and human PRMT6 (5′-GAGCAAGACACGGACGUUU-3′) were synthesized by Nippon EGT. siRNA for GFP (5′-CUACAACAGCCACAACGUC-3′) was purchased from B-Bridge. For siRNA transfection, cells were transfected by using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. siRNA-resistant PRMT1 was generated by creating six silent base pair mutations into the WT cDNA of PRMT1.
