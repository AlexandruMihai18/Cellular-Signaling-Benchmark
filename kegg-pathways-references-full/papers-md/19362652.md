Abstract

Butirosin and neomycin belong to a family of clinically valuable 2-deoxystreptamine (2DOS)-containing aminoglycoside antibiotics. The biosynthetic gene clusters for butirosin and neomycin were identified in 2000 and in 2005, respectively. In recent years, most of the enzymes encoded in the gene clusters have been characterized, and thus almost all the biosynthetic steps leading to the final antibiotics have been understood. This knowledge could shed light on the complex biosynthetic pathways for other related structurally diverse aminoglycoside antibiotics. In this chapter, the enzymatic reactions in the biosynthesis of butirosin and neomycin are reviewed step by step.

1. INTRODUCTION

The aminoglycosides are a well-known important class of clinically valuable antibiotics that interact with bacterial ribosomal RNA and inhibit protein synthesis. The majority of the aminoglycosides contain a unique aminocyclitol 2-deoxystreptamine (2DOS) moiety as the core, which is decorated with various aminosugars, leading to diverse structural molecules, including kanamycin, tobramycin, gentamicin, ribostamycin, butirosin, neomycin, paromomycin, lividomycin, apramycin, and hygromycin B. Other groups of aminoglycosides contain cyclitols either derived from myo-inositol-1-phosphate or from sedo-heptulose-7-phosphate as reviewed in Chapter 19 of this volume. A number of biosynthetic studies on bioactive secondary metabolites, including the aminoglycosides, have been carried out not only to improve the productivity of the antibiotics and to modify the structures to combat newly emerging resistant pathogenic strains, but also to understand the molecular details of the enzymology that builds the complex structures. Initial incorporation studies and mutational analyses of
the producer microorganisms suggested plausible biosynthetic pathways. Also, enzymatic analyses with cell-free systems from the producer strains revealed each enzymatic reaction in the biosynthetic pathways. However, because the purification of secondary metabolic enzymes is generally too hard, due to the low amount of proteins in the cells, only a few enzymatic reactions have been confirmed from the native producer microorganisms. The development of molecular genetic techniques in *Escherichia coli* around 1980 allowed the cloning of biosynthetic genes and their subsequent heterologous expression to obtain the corresponding recombinant proteins. This strategy was applied to the 2DOS biosynthetic studies. In 1999, a key biosynthetic enzyme, 2-deoxy-scyllo-inosose (2DOI) synthase, which catalyzes the first step of 2DOS biosynthesis, was purified from the butirosin producer, *Bacillus circulans* (*Kudo et al.*, 1999a), and its corresponding gene was subsequently cloned in *E. coli* (*Kudo et al.*, 1999b). This discovery boosted the rapid identification of many 2DOS-containing aminoglycoside biosynthetic gene clusters, including those for butirosin, neomycin, kanamycin, tobramycin, gentamicin, ribostamycin, paromomycin, lividomycin, apramycin, istamycin, and hygromycin B, because microbial secondary metabolic biosynthetic genes are usually clustered in the genomes of the producing microorganisms. Consequently, during the last decade, most of the enzymes encoded by the butirosin and neomycin biosynthetic gene clusters have been enzymatically characterized, revealing almost all the biosynthetic steps in the pathways. The identification of the aminoglycoside biosynthetic gene clusters and bioinformatic analysis have been summarized in recent excellent reviews (*Flatt and Mahmud*, 2007; *Piepersberg et al.*, 2007). Biosynthetic studies on 2DOS-containing aminoglycoside antibiotics were also recently reviewed (*Llewellyn and Spencer*, 2006). Thus, in this chapter, we focus step by step on the enzymatic reactions in the biosynthesis of butirosin and neomycin.

Before we go through each enzyme in the biosynthesis of butirosin and neomycin, all biosynthetic enzymes encoded in the gene clusters are summarized in Table 20.1. Comparative analysis of the putative biosynthetic enzymes and chemical structures of 4,5-disubstituted 2DOS aminoglycosides (butirosin and neomycin) and 4,6-disubstituted 2DOS aminoglycosides (kanamycin, tobramycin, and gentamicin), clearly suggested a set of seven conserved enzymes (Table 20.1, enzymes 1~7) for the biosynthesis of the common neamine structure. Also, four proteins (Table 20.1, enzymes 8, 9, 21, and 22) were specifically encoded in the butirosin and neomycin biosynthetic gene clusters, indicating their involvement in the ribosylation of neamine to give ribostamycin. By comparing the other 4,5-disubstituted 2DOS aminoglycoside (paromomycin and lividomycin) biosynthetic gene clusters, two unique enzymes for neomycin-related structures (Table 20.1, enzymes 10 and 11) and nine unique enzymes for butirosin (Table 20.1, enzymes 12~20) were classified with a reasonable degree of certainty.

Considering the putative functions from homology analysis with known functional enzymes, the enzymatic functions in each biosynthetic step were plausibly presumed and the expected enzymatic reactions were investigated with the recombinant proteins expressed in *E. coli*. Consequently, the overall biosynthetic pathways for butirosin and neomycin have been almost completely understood, as shown in Fig. 20.1, except for the epimerizations at the last steps and an oxidation reaction of 6″′-deamino-6″′-hydroxy-neomycin C indicated as broken arrows.

Although probable ABC transporters and regulatory proteins are not characterized, it is noteworthy that most of the proteins encoded in the gene clusters were found to be required for the construction of the relevant molecules. We also note that relatively large numbers of enzymes are repetitively used in the biosynthesis of the aminoglycosides. This fact may

mean that the producer microorganisms somehow minimize the set of enzymes to save energy or for the purposes of regulation.

We now show each biosynthetic enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of butirosin and neomycin. Here, the biosynthetic steps are divided into those for neamine formation, ribostamycin formation, neomycin formation, and AHBA biosynthesis in the butirosin pathway. Due to space limitations, we omit mechanistic insights into the enzyme reactions and will discuss these issues elsewhere.

2. **GENERAL METHOD TO INVESTIGATE FUNCTIONS OF THE BIOSYNTHETIC ENZYMES FOR AMINOGLYCOSIDES**

Chromosomal DNAs are first prepared from the cells of the producer microorganisms according to standard protocols such as those in *Practical Streptomyces Genetics* (Kieser et al., 2000). The aminoglycoside-producing microorganisms are often purchased from a stock center such as NBRC, JCM, or ATCC. Information on many aminoglycoside antibiotic biosynthetic genes is now widely available from public databases. Target genes are next amplified by standard PCR with designed primers having appropriate restriction sites and chromosomal DNA as a template. Usually, high-fidelity DNA polymerases such as PrimeSTAR HS DNA polymerase (TAKARA) and KOD plus DNA polymerase (TOYOBO) are used to obtain target DNA fragments. The amplified target DNAs are subcloned once into a commonly used standard plasmid vector such as pUC18, pT7Blue or pLITMUS28 according to a standard protocol (Sambrook et al., 2001). After confirmation of the sequences of the cloned DNAs, the target genes are inserted into the appropriate site of a suitable expression plasmid such as pET30, pET28 or pColdI. The expression plasmids with target genes are then introduced into an appropriate *E. coli* host such as BL21(DE3) for overexpression of the genes. The culture conditions (temperature, concentration of inducer compound such as isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside (IPTG), and media) depend on the target proteins. The *E. coli* cells expressing the target proteins are homogenized by use of a French Pressure Cell Press or sonic homogenizer to obtain the cell-free extract containing the recombinant proteins. His-tagged recombinant proteins are purified with Ni or Co affinity (such as Ni-NTA and TALON) chromatography. Also, conventional purification methods are applicable. Preparation of appropriate substrates is usually a difficult problem. Degradation of the parent antibiotics and chemical synthesis have been generally used up to now. However, once the sequenced biosynthetic enzymes have been functionally characterized, enzymatic synthesis could be used for the purpose.The enzyme reaction products could be detected by LC-ESI-MS directly or HPLC after derivatization, for example, with dansyl chloride or dinitrofluorobenzene, which attach UV-absorbing functional groups to the amino groups. The enzyme reaction products can also be purified by cation exchange chromatography. After the salt forms of the aminoglycosides have been exchanged for hydrochloride or sulfate, NMR analysis should be performed. See original papers for the details of the experiments in this section.

### 3. NEAMINE BIOSYNTHETIC ENZYMES (ENZYMES 1~7, AND 20)

#### 3.1. 2-Deoxy-scyllo-inosose (2DOI) synthase

2-Deoxy-scyllo-inosose (2DOI) synthase catalyzes the first step in the biosynthesis of 2-deoxystreptamine (2DOS). The conversion of D-glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) to 2DOI was first observed in a cell-free extract of neomycin-producing *S. fradiae* (Yamauchi and Kakinuma, 1992). The enzymatic conversion was then found to be an NAD⁺-dependent reaction. The corresponding enzyme, 2DOI synthase, was purified from the butirosin-producing *B. circulans* SANK72073 (Kudo et al., 1999a). The native 2DOI synthase derived from *B. circulans* was isolated as a heterodimer, composed of a 40-kDa subunit and a 20-kDa subunit. The corresponding genes, *btrC* and *btrC2*, were separately cloned by reverse genetic methodology on the basis of the N-terminal amino acid sequences of the native enzyme (Kudo et al., 1999b; Tamegai et al., 2002a) Eq. (20.1).

The encoded protein sequences for the large subunit (BtrC) showed significant similarity to dehydroquinate (DHQ) synthase, which catalyzes carbocyclic formation from 3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate-7-phosphate in the shikimate pathway. The recombinant BtrC is composed of 368 amino acids, 40,746 Da and has 2DOI synthase activity with NAD⁺ and Co²⁺. The optimum pH is 7.5 to 8.0. Under the optimum reaction conditions (pH 7.7 and 46 °C), the kinetic constants, \( k_{\text{cat}} \) 1.0 s⁻¹, \( K_{\text{m}} \) (G6P) 2.1 × 10⁻⁴ M, \( K_{\text{m}} \) (NAD⁺) 2.3 × 10⁻⁵ M, were determined. Except for the kinetic constants and stability, the biochemical properties are the same as those of the native heterodimeric enzyme (\( k_{\text{cat}} \) 7.3 × 10⁻² s⁻¹, \( K_{\text{m}} \) (G6P) 9.0 × 10⁻⁴ M, \( K_{\text{m}} \) (NAD⁺) 1.7 × 10⁻⁴ M, at pH 7.7, 46 °C). In additionto G6P, 2-deoxy-G6P, 3-deoxy-G6P, 2-fluoro-G6P ($K_{\mathrm{m}}$ $2.1 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{M}$) and 3-amino-G6P ($K_{\mathrm{m}}$ $1.4 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{M}$) are accepted as substrates, although 4-deoxy-G6P, 2-amino-G6P and 3-fluoro-G6P were not accepted (Eguchi *et al.*, 2002; Iwase *et al.*, 1998). The crystal structure of BtrC was solved and showed significant similarity to DHQ synthase (Nango *et al.*, 2008). Extensive mechanistic studies on 2DOI synthase have also been carried out and its similarity and dissimilarity to DHQ synthase were clearly elucidated (Hirayama *et al.*, 2007; Huang *et al.*, 2005b).

The 2DOI synthases derived from the neomycin producer S. fradiae NBRC12773 (Kudo *et al.*, 2005), the tobramycin/apramycin producer Streptoalloteichus hindustanus JCM3268 (Hirayama *et al.*, 2006), the ribostamycin producer S. ribosidificus ATCC21294 (active enzyme was only expressed in S. lividans) (Subba *et al.*, 2005), the kanamycin producer S. kanamyceticus ATCC12853 (Kharel *et al.*, 2004b), and the tobramycin producer S. tenebrarius ATCC17920 (Kharel *et al.*, 2004a) were shown to have activity. The kinetic constants for 2DOI synthase from S. hindustanus JCM3268 were found to be $k_{\mathrm{cat}}$ $0.075 \mathrm{s}^{-1}, K_{\mathrm{m}}$ (G6P) $6.9 \times 10^{-4} M$ (Hirayama *et al.*, 2006). Among the 2DOI synthases, BtrC seems to be the most active enzyme thus far characterized. The 2DOI synthase homologous gene is a useful biomarker for the identification of the biosynthetic gene clusters for 2DOS-containing aminoglycoside antibiotics. 2DOI itself is thought to be a valuable material for the production of fine chemicals such as carbaglucose and aromatic compounds (Kakinuma *et al.*, 2000). Thus, the 2DOI production system using the 2DOI synthase in E. coli has been greatly improved (Kogure *et al.*, 2007).

The small subunit of 2DOI synthase from B. circulans (BtrC2) was found to be an L-glutamine amidotransferase homologue involved in the newly identified pyridoxal-5′-phosphate (PLP) pathway in Bacillus (Burns *et al.*, 2005). This small subunit suppresses the 2DOI synthase activity but significantly stabilizes the protein complex. Thus, it was speculated that this small subunit controls the 2DOI synthase activity in the cells of microorganisms to keep a certain concentration of the aminoglycoside and PLP, which is required for many transamination reactions in aminoglycoside biosynthesis.

## 3.2. L-Glutamine:DOI Aminotransferase—a Dual-Function Aminotransferase in 2DOS Biosynthesis

The two transaminations with L-glutamine as an amino donor in 2DOS biosynthesis Eqs. (20.2) and (20.3) were extensively studied by the Walker group with the native enzymes derived from the producer strains. They found that the transamination activity could not be separated, indicating that these two transaminations were catalyzed by the same enzyme in the strains (Lucher *et al.*, 1989).
Among the biosynthetic genes for butirosin, one open reading frame (ORF), BtrS (also called BtrR), showed significant homology to L-glutamine:scyllo-inosose aminotransferase in the biosynthesis of streptomycin (Ahlert *et al.*, 1997), indicating that it could catalyze the amination of 2DOI to give 2-deoxy-scyllo-inosamine (2DOIA). In 2002, BtrS was found to be L-glutamine:2DOI aminotransferase and also the reverse reaction from 2DOS with pyruvate as an amino acceptor was detected, indicating that BtrS catalyzes two transaminations in DOS biosynthesis (Huang *et al.*, 2002; Tamegai *et al.*, 2002b). The structure of the reverse reaction product from 2DOS was confirmed as chiral 3-amino-2,3-dideoxy-scyllo-inosose (amino-DOI), indicating stereospecific recognition of two enantiotopic amino groups in 2DOS (Yokoyama *et al.*, 2005). Substrate recognition studies showed that the α-positions of the ketones of the substrates are not so important, but functional groups at the β-position are critical for recognition by this dual-function enzyme. The forward reaction of the second transamination was also confirmed with the neomycin biosynthetic enzyme (Kudo *et al.*, 2005). The crystal structure of this aminotransferase derived from *B. circulans* was solved and showed the tertiary structure of the enzyme, including its active site with PLP or PMP cofactors (Popovic *et al.*, 2006). The substrate-docking model displayed some possible recognition amino acid residues, but the precise recognition mechanism of the distinguishable enantiotopic amino groups of 2DOS on the amino acid level is still unclear. Thus, detailed studies, including mutational studies, are needed to understand the recognition mechanism. In streptomycin biosynthesis, two different aminotransferases are known to be involved in the construction of the streptidine moiety (Ahlert *et al.*, 1997; Walker and Walker, 1969). Thus, the recognition mechanism of this family of aminotransferase is quite interesting. The homologous aminotransferase derived from the neomycin producer *S. fradiae* NBRC12773 (Huang *et al.*, 2005a; Kudo *et al.*, 2005), and the tobramycin producer *S. tenebrarius* ATCC17920 (only the first transamination) (Kharel *et al.*, 2005), have been shown to have the activity.

3.2.1. NAD-dependent 2-deoxy-scyllo-inosamine dehydrogenase

This enzymatic reaction Eq. (20.4) was initially observed with a cell-free system from the neomycin producer *S. fradiae* and found to be an NAD⁺-dependent reaction (Suzukake *et al.*, 1985). Thus, an NAD⁺-dependent dehydrogenase encoded in the biosynthetic gene cluster was postulated in this oxidation reaction. Only one NAD⁺-dependent dehydrogenase homologous protein is conserved in the biosynthetic gene clusters for similarly structured aminoglycoside antibiotics. The corresponding ORF from the neomycin producer *S. fradiae* NBRC12773 was then expressed in *E. coli* and the expected NAD⁺-dependent oxidation of 2DOIA was observed in the presence of zinc ion (Kudo *et al.*, 2005). The product, amino-DOI, was indeed converted to 2DOS by the dual-function aminotransferase as mentioned above. However, this recombinant enzyme has not been purified yet to investigate the specific recognition mechanism. Although no other enzyme has been characterized so far, the other actinomycete enzymes seem to catalyze this oxidation reaction. Heterologous expression of several genes for kanamycin and gentamicin biosynthesis in *Streptomyces* clearly revealed that this type of NAD⁺-dependent dehydrogenase is involved in the biosynthesis (Kurumbang *et al.*, 2008; Park *et al.*, 2008).

![Chemical Reaction](https://i.imgur.com/1234567.png)

On the other hand, the corresponding enzyme derived from *B. circulans* did not show the activity at all, since the enzyme lacks the catalytically important zinc-binding motif, which is required for the activity of this class of dehydrogenase. So, the true function of the protein in *B. circulans* is unclear at the moment. It may be just a relic during evolution or may function at another biosynthetic step, such as the epimerization at C-3" of butirosin.

3.2.2. Radical SAM 2-deoxy-scyllo-inosamine dehydrogenase

A radical SAM dehydrogenase was found to catalyze the oxidation of 2DOIA to give amino-DOI in the biosynthesis of butirosin in *B. circulans* Eq. (20.5) (Yokoyama *et al.*, 2007). It was really unprecedented that this type of enzyme should be involved in 2DOS biosynthesis. The enzyme BtrN encoded in the butirosin biosynthetic gene cluster possesses a CXXXCXXC motif conserved within the radical S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) superfamily, which is an emerging group of enzymes that catalyze a wide range of radical reactions (Wang and Frey, 2007). The common mechanism found in all radical SAM enzymes is a reductive

cleavage of SAM to generate the 5′-deoxyadenosyl radical, which is subsequently used for radical reactions such as activation of other enzymes through generating a protein radical, sulfur insertion, C–C bond rearrangement, and amino group rearrangement. Disruption of *btrN* in the butirosin producer *B. circulans* blocked the biosynthetic pathway between 2DOIA and 2DOS. Further, *in vitro* assay of the overexpressed enzyme revealed that BtrN catalyzed the oxidation of 2DOIA under strictly anaerobic conditions along with consumption of an equimolar amount of SAM to produce 5′-deoxyadenosine, methionine, and amino-DOI. The BtrN reaction with [3-²H]2DOIA generated deuterated 5′-deoxyadenosine, while no deuterium was incorporated by incubation of unlabeled DOIA in the deuterium oxide buffer. These results indicated that the hydrogen atom at C-3 of 2DOIA was directly transferred to 5′-deoxyadenosine to give the radical intermediate of 2DOIA. The 2DOIA radical intermediate was also detected by EPR spectroscopy, clearly revealing the radical reaction mechanism (Yokoyama *et al.*, 2008a).

### 3.3. 2′-*N*-Acetylparomamine synthase (UDP-GlcNAc:2DOS *N*-acetylglucosaminyltransferase)

This glycosyltransfer reaction was presumed to be catalyzed by a retention-type of glycosyltransferase with nucleotidylyl sugars Eq. (20.6). Initially, NDP-glucosamine was thought to be a sugar donor in paromamine synthesis. However, the existence of the following pathway-specific deacetylase (Truman *et al.*, 2007) indicated that UDP-*N*-acetyl-β-glucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) is a most likely sugar donor. In the butirosin and neomycin biosynthetic gene clusters, only one obvious glycosyltransferase is encoded, suggesting that this type of enzyme catalyzes the glycosyl transfer reaction at this step. Although *B. circulans*-derived recombinant enzyme was not obtained as a soluble protein (unpublished), *S. fradiae*-derived recombinant enzyme was obtained in soluble form by coexpression with GroEL and GroES. The expected enzymatic reaction with 2DOS and UDP-GlcNAc in the presence of Mg²⁺ showed the production of 2″-*N*-acetylparomamine, which was clearly confirmed by NMR (Yokoyama *et al.*, 2008b). This enzyme has unfortunately not yet been purified to investigate the precise substrate specificity. Thus far, the impure enzymatic solution showed high specificity to UDP-GlcNAc over UDP-glucose, suggesting a specific GlcNAc transfer enzyme.

dehydrogenase was expressed in *E. coli* and the presence of the FAD cofactor in the protein was confirmed (Huang et al., 2007). The expected oxidation reaction of paromamine was successfully detected under aerobic conditions. On the other hand, removal of oxygen by flushing with argon gas caused a significant reduction in enzymatic activity, indicating reoxidation of the reduced FAD cofactor with molecular oxygen for the next catalytic cycle. The aldehyde product was converted to neamine by the following amino-transferase, suggesting that this FAD-dependent enzyme is involved in the oxidation step in neamine formation. This enzyme did not exhibit oxidation activity toward the possible biosynthetic intermediates UDP-GlcNAc, 2′-N-acetylparomamine, and paromomycin indicating the specific recognition of the paromamine molecule. However, this enzyme is presumed to catalyze the oxidation at C-6‴ of 6‴-deamino-6‴-hydroxyneomycin C. In fact, our preliminary study of the corresponding enzymatic reaction showed the expected activity. This family of enzyme is encoded in the paromomycin biosynthetic gene cluster, although the paromamine moiety remains in the final product. Thus, the recognition mechanism of this possibly dual functional FAD-dependent dehydrogenase is interesting.

![Chemical Reaction](https://i.imgur.com/1234567.png)

Inactivation of the corresponding gene in tobramycin biosynthesis caused the production of 6′-deamino-6′-hydroxy-kanamycin C, supporting the idea that this enzyme is involved in the oxidation reaction in the neamine moiety of in the biosynthesis of kanamycin/tobramycin (Yu et al., 2008).

## 3.6. 6′-Dehydro-6′-oxoparomamine aminotransferase

As mentioned above, this enzymatic activity was observed by coupled transformation from paromamine with the FAD-dependent enzyme and the PLP-dependent aminotransferase Eq. (20.9) (Huang et al., 2007). This aminotransferase exhibited the characteristic absorptions for enzyme-bound pyridoxal-5′-phosphate (PLP) and pyridoxamine-5′-phosphate (PMP). This aminotransferase preferred to use L-glutamine and L-glutamate as an amino donor in this reaction; L-leucine, L-lysine, L-arginine, L-aspartate, and S-adenosylmethionine were also accepted with reduced efficiency (Huang et al., 2007). The *B. circulans*-derived aminotransferase preferred to use L-glutamine rather than L-glutamate (unpublished).

In the gentamicin biosynthetic gene cluster, a total of four homologous aminotransferases are encoded and might be responsible for the aminotransfer reactions at specific carbons. So, precise characterization of substrate specificity of this type of aminotransferase should be important.

### 4. RIBOSTAMYCIN BIOSYNTHETIC ENZYMES (ENZYMES 8 AND 9)

#### 4.1. Phosphoribostamycin synthase (PRPP: neamine phosphoribosyltransferase)

Four conserved ORFs among the butirosin, neomycin, ribostamycin, paromomycin, and lividomycin biosynthetic gene clusters were presumed to be involved in the transformation of neamine to ribostamycin Eq. (20.10). All of the enzymes were expressed in *E. coli*, and all combinations of the enzymes were examined to detect the expected ribosylation reaction with 5-phosphoribosyl-1-diphosphate as a possible ribosyl donor. As a result, one of the proteins was characterized as 5-phosphoribosyl-1-diphosphate:neamine 5-phosphoribosyltransferase, and another was found to be 5′-phosphoribostamycin phosphatase to give ribostamycin (*Kudo et al.*, 2007). The other two proteins remain to be characterized, although they may be involved in the ribostamycin-related chemistry in the biosynthesis.

Only the *B. circulans*-derived enzyme has been functionally characterized so far. Due to the instability of the protein, the substrate specificity was investigated with cell-free extracts of *E. coli* expressing this enzyme. As a result, paromamine was accepted as a substrate, but not kanamycin A. Thus, this enzyme seems to recognize the pseudodisaccharide structure of

2DOS-containing aminoglycosides. The enzyme was also found to have optimum catalytic activity at pH 7.5, at a temperature between 27 and 32 °C, and required an essential divalent metal ion: optimally Mg²⁺, Ni²⁺, or Co²⁺. However, further research is needed to solve the precise chemistry of this unique 5-phosphoribosyltransferase.

### 4.2. Phosphoribostamycin phosphatase

As mentioned above, this enzymatic reaction was detected with a coupled reaction with PRPP:neamine 5-phosphoribosyltransferase (Kudo *et al.*, 2007) Eq. (20.11). Only the *B. circulans*-derived enzyme has been characterized so far. The recombinant enzyme was purified and no metal requirement for the phosphatase activity was observed. The substrate specificity of the enzyme was also investigated with PRPP, ribose 5-phosphate, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, fructose 6-phosphate, AMP, GMP, CMP, UMP, and TMP in addition to *p*-nitrophenyl phosphate, since authentic 5′-phosphoribostamycin was not available. *p*-Nitrophenyl phosphate was well hydrolyzed by this enzyme, and fructose 1,6-bisphosphate was also hydrolyzed, although the regiospecificity was not elucidated. The other possible substrates including PRPP were not hydrolyzed by this phosphatase at all. More studies are needed to solve the recognition mechanism of 5′-phosphoribostamycin phosphatase.

### 5. NEOMYCIN BIOSYNTHETIC ENZYMES (ENZYMES 5~7, 10, AND 11) (ADDITION OF NEOSAMINE B TO RIBOSTAMYCIN)

#### 5.1. UDP-GlcNAc:ribostamycin N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase

As shown in Table 20.1, two unique ORFs were identified in the neomycin, paromomycin, and lividomycin biosynthetic gene clusters. Among them, one ORF was found to encode a radical SAM enzyme, which was presumed not to be involved in the glycosylation event. Another ORF was found to show low similarity to some glycosyltransferases, especially at the C-terminal end. Thus, the enzyme derived from the neomycin producer *S. fradiae* was expressed in

E. coli and the glycosylation of ribostamycin with UDP-GlcNAc Eq. (20.12) was examined (Yokoyama et al., 2008b). The product, 2″-N-acetyl-6″-deamino-6″-hydroxyneomycin C, was clearly confirmed by NMR. This enzyme specifically recognized ribostamycin as glycosyl acceptor rather than 2DOS, paromamine, 2′-N-acetylparomamine, and neamine, and UDP-G-lcNAc as glycosyl donor rather than UDP-Glc. This enzyme requires an essential divalent metal ion: optimally Mg²⁺, Mn²⁺, or Co²⁺.

![Equation 20.12](https://i.imgur.com/1234567.png)

**5.2. 2″-N-Acetyl-6″-deamino-6″-hydroxyneomycin C deacetylase (repetitive function of 2′-N-acetylparomamine deacetylase)**

In the neomycin-related antibiotic biosynthetic gene clusters, only one obvious deacetylase functioning as 2′-N-acetylparomamine deacetylase is encoded, suggesting the repetitive use of the deacetylase Eq. (20.13). As expected, the enzyme also catalyzed the deacetylation of 2″-N-acetyl-6″-deamino-6″-hydroxyneomycin C to give 6″-deamino-6″-hydroxyneo-mycin C, which was confirmed by NMR (Yokoyama et al., 2008b). Thus, the enzyme seems to recognize only the N-acetylglucosamine moiety in aminoglycosides.

![Equation 20.13](https://i.imgur.com/ABCDEFG.png)

**5.3. 6″-Deamino-6″-hydroxyneomycin C dehydrogenase (probable repetitive function of paromamine 6′-dehydrogenase, uncharacterized)**

This oxidation reaction Eq. (20.14) was presumed to be catalyzed by paromamine 6′-dehydrogenase, since the reaction scheme appears to be similar to the oxidation of C-6 of the glucosamine moiety, and also other candidates are not found in the gene clusters. In fact, our preliminary study showed the oxidation activity of the enzyme (unpublished).

### 5.4. 6"′-Deamino-6"′-dehydro-6"′-oxoneomycin C aminotransferase

This reverse reaction Eq. (20.15) was confirmed to be catalyzed by 6'-oxoparomamine aminotransferases derived from *S. fradiae* and *B. circulans* (*Huang et al.*, 2007). Our preliminary result showed a sequential oxidation and transamination of 6"′-deamino-6"′-hydroxyneomycin C to neomycin C (unpublished). We are now in the process of confirming the structure of the product as neomycin C, not neomycin B, since an epimerization reaction was suspected during the sequential enzymatic reaction.

The last step of neomycin B biosynthesis appears to be the epimerization reaction at C-5"′ of neomycin C to neomycin B, although the timing of the epimerization is not clear at present. A putative radical SAM enzyme, which is also encoded in the paromomycin and lividomycin biosynthetic gene clusters, remains to be solved. This protein may catalyze the epimerization at C-5"′ of neomycin C with a radical mechanism. Functional analysis of this enzyme derived from *S. fradiae* is in progress.

### 6. (S)-4-AMINO-2-HYDROXYBUTYRATE BIOSYNTHETIC ENZYMES (ENZYMES 12~19) (ADDITION OF AHBA TO RIBOSTAMYCIN)

The (S)-4-amino-2-hydroxybutyryl (AHBA) moiety at 1-N of the 2DOS of butirosin is a structurally unique feature. It is well known that AHBA attachment on kanamycin A and dibekacin lead to the clinically valuable amikacin and arbekacin (*Kondo and Hotta*, 1999). Labeling studies

to seek the attachment of AHBA with several amino acids such as L-glutamate, γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and AHBA were performed, showing that L-glutamate and GABA are direct precursors to the AHBA moiety of butirosin but not AHBA itself (Yukita *et al.*, 2003). Thus, a certain activation reaction of the carboxyl group was presumed before the loading of the amino acid substituent.

The butirosin biosynthetic gene cluster contains seven unique contiguous genes compared with the neomycin biosynthetic gene cluster (Table 20.1, 12~15, 17~19). The Spencer group expressed six of the seven enzymes and one probable NADH:FAD oxidoreductase encoded in the butirosin biosynthetic gene cluster and elegantly figured out the unique AHBA biosynthetic pathway and transfer reaction onto ribostamycin to give butirosin, as described in this section (Li *et al.*, 2005; Llewellyn *et al.*, 2007).

### 6.1. γ-L-glutamyl-ACP ligase and the pathway-specific acyl carrier protein

First of all, the pathway-specific acyl carrier protein (ACP) was characterized, since acyl-activated enzymology was presumed, as in the polyketide synthase and non-ribosomal peptide synthetase reactions. Initially, certain acyl ACP intermediates derived from L-glutamate or GABA were presumed from the previous incorporation study. The ACP was expressed in *E. coli* and the majority of the recombinant protein was obtained as the apo form of ACP. Therefore, the gene was then coexpressed with the wide-spectrum 4′-phosphopantetheine transferase (PPTase, Sfp) derived from *B. subtilis* to obtain the holo form of the ACP, which was confirmed by LC-ESI-MS.

\begin{equation}
\text{ACP-SH} \xrightarrow[\text{L-glutamate, Mg}^{2+}, \text{Mn}^{2+}]{\gamma\text{-L-glutamyl-ACP ligase*}} \text{O}_2\text{C}\overset{\text{NH}_3^+}{\text{CH}_2}\text{CH}_2\text{CO}\text{S}_{\text{ACP}} + \text{ADP and Pi}
\tag{20.16}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\text{NH}_3^+\text{CH}_2\text{CH}_2\text{CO}\text{S}_{\text{ACP}} \xrightarrow[\text{L-glutamine, Mg}^{2+}, \text{Mn}^{2+}]{\gamma\text{-L-glutamyl-γ-aminobutyryl-ACP ligase*}} \text{O}_2\text{C}\overset{\text{NH}_3^+}{\text{CH}_2}\text{CO}\text{N}\text{H}\text{CH}_2\text{CH}_2\text{CO}\text{S}_{\text{ACP}} + \text{ADP and Pi}
\tag{20.17}
\end{equation}

*same enzyme as the ligase at the first step*

The second enzyme was γ-L-glutamyl-ACP ligase, which shows weak local similarity to biotin carboxylase and carbamoyl phosphate synthase. These enzymes belong to the growing ATP grasp superfamily, which includes D-alanine:D-alanine ligase, glutathione synthetase, glyciamide ribonucleotide transformylase, and succinyl-CoA synthetase. These enzymes
exhibit a characteristic ATP-binding motif and possess ATP-dependent carboxyl-amine or carboxyl-thiol ligase activity. The reaction mechanism of the enzymes was proposed to involve the generation of acyl phosphate intermediate *via* hydrolysis of ATP to ADP. The enzyme was expressed in *E. coli* and the recombinant protein was found to require DTT in the buffer solution to prevent aggregation. The recombinant enzyme reacted with ATP and various amino acids including L-glutamate, D-glutamate, GABA, and AHBA in the presence of MgCl₂, MnCl₂, and KCl. Then, a possible ATPase activity was demonstrated by detecting ADP, which was coupled to the reaction of pyruvate kinase and NADH-dependent lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). As a result, only in the presence of L-glutamate, a decrease of NADH was observed, suggesting L-glutamate-dependent ATPase activity of the enzyme. Also, this observation implied the involvement of a possible L-glutamylphosphate intermediate, which can be transferred onto the holo-ACP. In fact, addition of the holo-ACP to the enzyme reaction gave L-glutamyl-S-ACP as product, which was detected by LC-ESI-MS Eq. (20.16). Since L-glutamate should be converted to AHBA through decarboxylation of the α-carboxy group, the γ-carboxy group was presumed to be attached to the ACP. Obviously L-glutamate was found to be the best substrate for the reaction rather than GABA and AHBA, and consistent with the incorporation experiments. The incorporation of GABA into butirosin could be due to a weak activity of the enzyme.

### 6.2. γ-L-glutamyl ACP Decarboxylase

The enzyme shows significant similarity to a PLP-dependent ornithine/arginine/diaminopimelate decarboxylase family and was thus thought to be involved in the decarboxylation of the α-carboxyl moiety of the L-glutamate portion Eq. (20.18). To investigate the expected decarboxylation activity, the expressed purified enzyme was added to the above-mentioned γ-L-Glu–ACP ligase reaction mixture to detect the probable GABA-ACP intermediate. However, surprisingly, γ-L-glutamyl-γ-aminobutyl-ACP was clearly observed by LC-ESI-MS. No γ-L-Glu-γ-L-Glu–ACP or GABA–ACP was observed in the reaction mixture, suggesting that after the decarboxylation of γ-L-Glu–ACP to GABA–ACP by the decarboxylase, the resulting GABA–ACP was further glutamylated by γ-Glu–ACP ligase to afford γ-L-Glu-GABA–ACP. In fact, when the γ-Glu–ACP ligase reaction was quenched by the addition of EDTA after γ-L-Glu–ACP formation, and then the decarboxylase was added to the solution, the expected GABA-ACP was observed by LC-ESI-MS. This decarboxylase weakly accepted free amino acids, suggesting specific recognition of the acyl ACP. Thus, a series of transformations from the holo-ACP to γ-L-Glu-GABA–ACP Eq. (20.16), (20.18), then (20.17) have been clearly demonstrated.

### 6.3. $\gamma$-L-glutamyl-4-aminobutyryl ACP mono-oxygenase and NAD(P)H:FMN oxidoreductase

The third and fourth enzymes are involved in a two-component mono-oxygenase reaction, which is the stereospecific hydroxylation at C-2 of $\gamma$-L-Glu-GABA-ACP to give $\gamma$-L-Glu-AHBA-ACP Eq. (20.19). One enzyme is $\gamma$-L-Glu-GABA-ACP mono-oxygenase encoded in the butirosin-specific gene cassette. This enzyme shows sequence similarity to alkanesulfonate mono-oxygenase, which is involved in sulfur metabolism. This enzymatic reaction system utilizes two proteins to hydroxylate the substrate; one is an oxidoreductase that catalyzes the reduction of FMN with NAD(P)H as an electron donor, and the other is a mono-oxygenase that catalyzes the hydroxylation of the substrate in the presence of FMNH₂ and molecular oxygen. In this two-component system, the oxidoreductase provides FMNH₂ to the mono-oxygenase to reduce molecular oxygen to water and to attach a hydroxy group to the substrate. This sort of enzyme is encoded 20 kb upstream of the mono-oxygenase gene in the butirosin biosynthetic gene cluster. Thus, the enzyme was proposed to be the oxidoreductase to supply FADH₂ to the mono-oxygenase.

(20.19)

The purified recombinant oxidoreductase expressed in *E. coli* was found to contain FMN as the cofactor rather than FAD. Kinetic studies on this oxidoreductase were also conducted to characterize it as an NAD(P)H:FMN oxidoreductase, which reduces FMN to FMNH₂ with NAD(P)H, presumably for the FMN-dependent mono-oxygenase.

The mono-oxygenase was also expressed in *E. coli* and purified in colorless form, suggesting no bound flavin cofactor in the protein. Thus, free FMNH₂ from the above-mentioned NADH:FMN oxidoreductase seemed to be used for the mono-oxygenase reaction. In fact, in the presence of the NADH:FMN oxidoreductase system, the recombinant mono-oxygenase catalyzed the hydroxylation of $\gamma$-L-Glu-GABA-ACP to afford $\gamma$-L-Glu-AHBA-ACP, which was detected by LC-ESI-MS. Indeed, FMN and molecular oxygen were required for the hydroxylation.

6.4. $ \gamma $-L-glutamyl-4-amino-2-hydroxybutyryl ACP: ribostamycin $ \gamma $-L-glutamyl-4-amino-2-hydroxybutyryltransferase

Two unpredictable functional enzymes encoded in the butirosin-specific biosynthetic gene cassette were then proposed to be involved in the AHBA acyl-transfer reaction to complete butirosin B biosynthesis Eqs. (20.20) and (20.21). Both enzymes were expressed in *E. coli* and purified to investigate the expected reaction with the above-mentioned $ \gamma $-L-Glu-AHBA–ACP, which was prepared by Sfp with synthetic $ \gamma $-L-Glu-AHBA-CoA, and ribostamycin as the acceptor substrate. The LC-ESI-MS analysis of the reaction clearly confirmed the production of butirosin B. When either of two enzymes was used for the reaction, only one of the reactions gave a new product, which corresponded to $ \gamma $-L-Glu-butirosin B. Thus, the enzyme was characterized as $ \gamma $-L-Glu-AHBA–ACP:ribostamycin $ \gamma $-L-Glu-AHBA transferase. Subsequently, another enzyme was found to be involved in the cleavage of the glutamyl moiety to give butirosin B.

In this two-enzyme reaction, 2DOS and paromamine were not converted to the corresponding AHBA derivatives. Neamine was less effectively converted to AHBA neamine than ribostamycin. Thus, as illustrated, ribostamycin is the only true substrate in butirosin biosynthesis. On the other hand, the related 4,5-disubstituted aminoglycosides, paromomycin and neomycin, were converted to the corresponding AHBA derivatives but not the 4,6-disubstituted aminoglycoside gentamicin C and kanamycin. However, interestingly, when a high concentration of the $ \gamma $-L-Glu-AHBA–ACP analog, $ \gamma $-L-Glu-AHBA–S-N-acetylcysteamine thioester (5 mM) was used for the $ \gamma $-L-Glu-AHBA transferase reaction, various aminoglycosides, including neomycin, paromomycin, 2DOS, paromamine, neamine, apramycin, kanamycin, and gentamicin C, were all acylated. Since the $ \gamma $-L-Glu-AHBA–SNAC thioester was also hydrolyzed by the following $ \gamma $-L-glutamyl cyclotransferase, stepwise addition of the two enzymes was required to complete the synthesis of the AHBA derivative (Llewellyn and Spencer, 2008). This chemoenzymatic method could be a promising approach to create a range of AHBA-containing aminoglycosides.

6.5. $ \gamma $-L-glutamyl-butirosin B $ \gamma $-L-glutamyl cyclotransferase

As the above-mentioned results show, the enzyme responsible for the final step of AHBA attachment has been clarified as $ \gamma $-L-Glu cyclotransferase. Another product of the reaction, in addition to butirosin B, was found to be

pyroglutamate. Thus, this enzyme was characterized as a novel $\gamma$-L-Glu-butirosin $\gamma$-L-Glu cyclotransferase. The reaction mechanism was proposed as the direct nucleophilic transamidation of the $\alpha$-amino group of the $\gamma$-L-glutamyl moiety to give butirosin B and pyroglutamate Eq. (20.21). An alternative mechanism involving initial formation of a $\gamma$-L-Glu-enzyme intermediate followed by pyroglutamate formation cannot be excluded. Further detailed biochemical studies are necessary to elucidate the reaction mechanism.

(20.21)

The only remaining butirosin-specific enzyme encoded in the cluster is a putative NADP⁺-dependent dehydrogenase, which might be involved in the epimerization at C-3′′ of butirosin B and ribostamycin to butirosin A and xylostacin, respectively. Or the above-mentioned inactive enzyme as a NAD-dependent 2DOIA dehydrogenase might be involved in this reaction. At the present time, even the timing of the epimerization of the ribose moiety is not clear. Further investigation is therefore required to fully understand the epimerization reaction in the butirosin biosynthetic pathway.

### 7. OTHER RELATED ENZYMES IN THE BIOSYNTHESIS OF 2DOS-CONTAINING AMINOGLYCOSIDE ANTIBIOTICS

Thus far, not so many enzymatic studies on kanamycin, tobramycin and gentamicin have been reported. Only several of the same enzymes in the biosynthesis of 2DOS, paromamine, and neamine have been characterized by enzymatic analyses and gene inactivation studies. Some of the enzymes from the kanamycin biosynthetic pathway are covered in Chapter 19 in this volume. Thus far, the basic enzymatic reactions from G6P to 2DOS, paromamine, and neamine are believed to be the same as characterized in butirosin and neomycin biosynthesis. Although several branching enzymatic reactions such as deamination, deoxygenations, methylations, and glycosylations should be involved, no specific enzyme for such reactions has been enzymatically characterized yet. One important study by heterologous expression of several enzymes encoded in the gentamicin biosynthetic gene cluster in *Streptomyces venezuelae* showed the involvement of a novel type of glycosyltransferase, which catalyzes xylose transfer onto paromamine in the biosynthesis of gentamicin ([Park et al., 2008](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M705958200)). Although detailed studies are required, this is definitely a branching enzyme among structurally diverse 2DOS-containing aminoglycoside antibiotics. Another recent important finding by gene

inactivation is that a radical SAM enzyme is involved after gentamicin A2 formation (Kim *et al.*, 2008). Further enzymatic analysis will show more detailed enzymatic reaction mechanisms in this class of antibiotics.

# 8. CONCLUDING REMARKS AND FUTURE PERSPECTIVES

The sequential biosynthetic pathways leading to butirosin and neomycin have been mostly enzymatically characterized. This knowledge shed light on the other related aminoglycoside biosynthetic enzymology. These researches also provided fundamental insights into unexpected enzymatic functions, such as the AHBA biosynthetic enzymes and radical SAM dehydrogenase. Thus, characterizations of secondary metabolite biosynthetic enzymes expand general knowledge of enzymatic catalysis, in addition to understanding complex secondary metabolism. The epimerization steps in both butirosin and neomycin biosynthetic pathways are still unclear. These enzymatic reactions should be quite unique to each biosynthetic pathway and thus expand the molecular diversity of aminoglycoside antibiotics. Although structurally related kanamycin-, tobramycin- and gentamicin-specific biosynthetic enzymes are not enzymatically characterized, the branching enzymes will be functionally characterized based on the knowledge of the butirosin and neomycin biosynthetic enzymes. Then, in future, combinatorial enzymatic synthesis of aminoglycoside antibiotics, which might produce significant biological activities, should be possible. For the purpose, in addition to characterization of enzymes, further detailed biochemical studies on the biosynthetic enzymes will be needed.
