New Insights into the Mycolate-Containing Compound Biosynthesis and Transport in Mycobacteria

Annaik Quémard${}^{1,*}$

Mycolic acids are extremely-long-chain fatty acids that compose a large family of mycolate-containing compounds, major envelope lipid components and critical pathogenicity factors of *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*. In recent years there have been major advances in understanding their metabolic pathway. Unknown enzymes of the fatty acid synthase type II elongation system and the condensation system that builds the mycolic acid scaffold were identified. Missing links with the mycolate-containing compound biosynthesis—such as the mechanisms of transfer onto trehalose and of translocation through the inner membrane—were deciphered, while recycling processes have emerged. Beyond the more accurate picture of the biosynthesis and translocation pathways dedicated to these unique molecules, major issues that should be addressed in the future are also discussed.

A High Diversity of Mycolate-Containing Compounds Dedicated to an Array of Biological Functions

The story of the mycolic acids (MAs) started 80 years ago when they were isolated as the major lipid components of the tubercle bacillus envelope. These α-alkylated β-hydroxylated molecules—which typify the Corynebacteriales order, including the causative agents of many diseases such as tuberculosis (*TB*; *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* or *Mtb*), leprosy (*Mycobacterium leprae*) and diphtheria (*Corynebacterium diphtheriae*)—are the longest fatty acids ever found in nature. Mycobacteria produce specimens among the longest ones (C${}_{60}$–C${}_{90}$) ([Figure 1](#)), but even longer molecules, called ‘ultra/extra long-chain mycolic acids’ (XL-MAs), were recently discovered in the *Segniliparus* genus and certain mycobacterial species [1–4]. Various types of chemical function (cyclopropane ring, double bond, methyl branch and oxygenated functions) on the main ‘meromycolic’ chain define different MA subclasses ([Figure 1](#)). The anchoring of the MAs in the outer membrane or mycomembrane, where they are believed to adopt singular foldings such as the ‘W-shape’ conformation ([Figure 1](#) [5–8]), gives them a strategic position within the envelope, at the interface between the cell wall and the protective outer layer [9]. The MAs compose a broad array of mycolate-containing compounds, where they are linked either to the arabino-galactan forming the cell wall mycolyl-arabinogalactan-peptidoglycan (mAGP) complex or to diverse polyol molecules such as trehalose ([Figure 1](#)). Large amounts of free MAs are also present in the extracellular matrix of mycobacteria grown as biofilms, and are required for this type of growth [10,11]. MAs are essential to the survival of mycobacteria and crucial for their physiology and fitness [12–22]. Furthermore, they play a role in the virulence and the persistence of *Mtb* within infected organisms, strongly potentiating the immune response to infection [4,13,18,20–23]. The functionality of the free MAs and mycolate-containing lipids is critically

Trends

HadAB and HadBC enzymes of the mycobacterial FAS-II system are a novel type of bacterial monofunctional 3-hydroxyacyl-ACP dehydratases.

The mycolic condensation system is at least composed of FadD32, Pks13, CmrA, and AccA3-AccD4, all with unique properties dedicated to the very long chain molecules that form the mycolic scaffold.

The transfer of unreduced mycoloyl chains onto trehalose, a pivotal step of the mycolate-containing compound biosynthesis, is catalyzed by the Pks13 thioesterase-like domain following a new lipid transfer mechanism.

The RND superfamily transporter MmpL3 exports the mycoloyl chains carried by trehalose to the envelope for the mycomembrane biogenesis, and the extracellular matrix formation during biofilm growth. Other (mero) mycolic acid derivatives are likely exported by MmpL11.

Extracellular free mycolic acids and trehalose enzymatically released from mycolate-containing compounds are likely recycled via ABC transporters.

influenced by the length of the mycoloyl chains, the nature and stereochemistry of the two functional groups in the meromycolic chain, and the nature of the hydrophilic head [13,24].

MAs are the products of a mixed fatty acid synthase (FAS)/polyketide synthase (PKS) biosynthesis pathway (Figure 2). They result from the condensation between a very long meromycolic chain and a shorter carboxylated fatty acyl chain that generates the α-chain; this step is catalyzed by the so-called 'mycolic condensation system'. Mycobacteria have the unique property of possessing two FAS systems [25]. The eukaryote-type FAS-I, made of a large multidomain polypeptide, displays a bimodal product profile corresponding to the precursors of the meromycolic chains, that is, C₁₆–C₁₈ acyl-CoAs, and to the α-chain, that is, C₂₂–C₂₆ acyl-CoAs (Figure 2). The FAS type II (FAS-II) system takes over to synthesize the meromycolic chains via iterative elongation cycles. Thereafter, I will focus on the recent advances made in the field of the mycolate-containing compound biosynthesis and transport in mycobacteria.

## A New Type of Dehydratases in the Mycobacterial FAS-II System

The FAS-II systems are made of discrete monofunctional proteins [25]. In contrast to the standard FAS-II systems that perform de novo biosynthesis, the mycobacterial FAS-II has the unique property of elongating standard-sized fatty-acid precursors (C₁₆–C₁₈) into unusually long-chain fatty acids (C₃₆–C₇₂), the meroMAs (Figure 2). The iterative elongation cycles include four main catalytic steps dependent on a mycobacterial acyl carrier protein (ACP), AcpM. Three of these steps are catalyzed by enzymes homologous to bacterial FAS-II components: the β-ketoacyl-ACP synthetases KasA and KasB, the β-ketoacyl-ACP reductase MabA, and the trans-2-enoyl-ACP reductase InhA [21]. In contrast, no (3R)-hydroxyacyl-ACP dehydratase (HAD) could be identified in the mycobacterial genomes by simple sequence homology with the FabZ (dehydratase) or FabA (dehydratase-isomerase) enzymes that classically bear this function in bacterial FAS-II systems [26].

Figure 2. The Mycolic Acid Biosynthesis Pathway. The mycolic acids (MAs) are biosynthesized by three main systems (dark blue). The pathway starts with the de novo bimodal production of long-chain acyl-CoAs by the FAS-I system. The C16–C18 chains are further elongated into an array of meromycolic acids via iterative cycles operated by the FAS-II system. KasA and HadAB enzymes are involved in the early elongation cycles, whereas KasB and HadBC enzymes take over during the late elongation cycles. The meromycolic acids are differentiated by introduction of different types of function at steps that remain to be defined (broken arrow). Then, both meromycolic acids and FAS-I acyl-CoA products (C22–C26), providing the α-branch, are activated by the mycolic condensation system prior to being condensed, and transferred onto the carrier trehalose to generate, after reduction, trehalose monomycolates (see Figure 1 for detailed structure, and Figure 3 for detailed reaction steps). The genes corresponding to most partner enzymes (light blue) are mentioned in italics. The enzymes shown to be regulated by Ser/Thr protein kinase-mediated post-translational phosphorylation are indicated by an asterisk. The hydrocarbon chain lengths depend on the MA subclass and the mycobacterial species. Abbreviation: AcpM, mycobacterial FAS-II acyl carrier protein. Adapted from [21].

Mtb genome led to the identification of eleven putative (R)-specific enoyl hydratases/3-hydroxyacyl dehydratases related to the hydratase 2 protein family, where the underlying 3D structure of FabA/Z-type enzymes is maintained in the so-called hot dog fold but the catalytic motif is distinct [26,27]. Among them, a cluster of three proteins, HadA, HadB, and HadC, satisfied all the *in silico* selection criteria for FAS-II dehydratase candidates and their operon Rv0635-Rv0636-Rv0637 proved to be essential for Mtb survival [14]. These subunits were shown to assemble in two distinct heterodimers, HadAB and HadBC, exhibiting the expected enzymatic properties for the long-sought HADs of the mycobacterial FAS-II [13]. The essentiality of the *hadB* orthologue in *Mycobacterium smegmatis*, a nontuberculous mycobacterium, both for growth and MA synthesis, is consistent with these data [28]. HadAB and HadBC represent a new type of monofunctional HADs in bacteria [14]. Interestingly, the FAS-II dehydratase step was shown to be the primary target of both former antituberculous thiourea prodrugs thiacetazone and isoxyl [29,30], whose active forms chemically modify the HadA subunit, thereby inhibiting HadAB activity [31]. Structural predictions suggested that the heterodimers would organize as asymmetrical ‘double hot dog’ folds reminiscent of the *R*-hydratase domain of eukaryotic MFE-2 enzymes, where the HadB subunit would contain the catalytic apparatus while the HadA or HadC subunit would stabilize the long acyl chain of the substrate [14]. Crystal structures of the HadAB enzyme have validated this hypothesis [32,33]. Based on their distinct substrate chain length specificities and their distribution among the Corynebacteriales producing MAs of different chain lengths, it has been proposed that HadAB would be involved in the early elongation cycles catalyzed by FAS-II similarly to KasA, while HadBC would catalyze, similarly to KasB, the late elongation steps occurring in mycobacteria and related genera containing full-sized MAs [14]. In a very recent study, the *hadC* gene of *Mtb* was shown to be nonessential but important for bacterial virulence, cording (aggregation in cord-like structures), biofilm growth, and level of sensitivity to the TB drug rifampicin [4]. Its point mutation (in the model avirulent strain *Mtb* H37Ra), and its deletion, both resulted in a similar phenotype, that is, a strong reduction in the global content of the oxygenated MAs (methoxy- and keto-MAs, Figure 1) [4], which was reminiscent of the *Mtb ΔkasB* phenotype [15]. Additionally, *hadC* inactivation blocked the formation of extra-long MAs bearing a fourth cyclopropanated meromycolic segment [4]. This work, which validates the previous biosynthesis model, has refined the knowledge about the respective roles of HadAB and HadBC, showing that the latter is required for an efficient biosynthesis of the oxygenated MAs and the XL-MAs. The deletion of the *hadC* gene of *M.* *smegmatis* had a dramatic effect on its physiology and fitness, exacerbated in the double *hadA hadC* mutant, and triggered an alteration of the MA profile [12]. The unexpected nonessentiality of both genes *in vitro* suggests that a protein homologous to HadA or HadC might exist in *M.* *smegmatis* or that a surrogate HadB homodimer might allow the maintenance of a sufficient MA production in laboratory cultures when HadA and HadC subunits are missing [12].

Putative additional mycobacterial FAS-II dehydratases have been searched for within the pool of hydratase 2 proteins [26,27]. Based on the heterologous complementation of a HAD mutant of the yeast mitochondrial FAS-II system, three *Mtb* proteins, Rv0241c, Rv3389c, and Rv0130, were proposed to have the same function as HadAB and HadBC [34,35]. However, the purified proteins displayed enzymatic properties incompatible with mycobacterial FAS-II enzymes [26,34,36], and *Mtb* Rv3389c and Rv0241c mutants had no change in their MA profiles [26,36]. Therefore, these three proteins are not components of FAS-II. The relevance of the simple use of a heterologous complementation strategy to identify proteins of this system is questioned. Intriguingly, the nonessential MSMEG_6754 gene encoding a putative dehydratase in *M.* *smegmatis*, with no orthologue in the *Mtb* complex, was able to complement *M.* *smegmatis* and *Mtb* *hadB* mutants for survival only when highly expressed [37]. The MSMEG_6754 crystal structure suggests that this double hot dog folded protein could welcome long-chain substrates. Overexpression of the MSMEG_6754 gene in wild-type *Mtb* altered MA distribution, but the lipid profile remained unchanged in the *M.* *smegmatis* MSMEG_6754
deletion mutant. Therefore, the question of the true role of this protein in the nontuberculous mycobacteria was raised by the authors [37]. Interestingly, MSMEG_6754 is important for the innate resistance of *M. smegmatis* to thiacetazone [37].

In conclusion, the mycobacterial FAS-II system holds a novel type of bacterial monofunctional hydroxyacyl-ACP dehydratases, HadAB and HadBC. The poor substrate specificity of certain enzymes within the large pool of mycobacterial hydratases/dehydratases may lead to misinterpretation of their function.

## Enzymatic Differentiation of the Meromycolic Chains

While many enzymes catalyzing steps of the multienzyme FAS-II machinery are well characterized, the proteins responsible for the introduction, at the proximal and distal positions of the meromycolic chains, of double bonds believed to be further modified into oxygenated functions or cyclopropane rings (Figures 1 and 2) remain unknown. Furthermore, it is not clear yet at which precise step of the MA biosynthesis pathway these modifications are introduced, although an array of data suggest that at least some of them are formed during the FAS-II elongation cycles [38–43]. The modifications are mostly synthesized by a family of paralogous S-adenosylmethionine-dependent MA methyltransferases (MA-MTs) [44–49], whose structures and functions have been thoroughly reviewed [21]. Yet, some issues remain unanswered about the differentiation steps, and here we focus on the latest surveys that bring elements of a response. It has been recently established that the putative orthologue of *Mtb* UmaA MA-MT in *M. smegmatis*, MSMEG_0913, catalyzes the formation of a *trans* cyclopropyl group or double bond with an adjacent methyl branch, at the proximal position of both α- and epoxy-MAs [47]. Yet, the function of *Mtb* UmaA enzyme still remains obscure. Indeed, complementation of *M. smegmatis* MSMEG_0913 with the *Mtb umaA* gene was unsuccessful, and no change in MA fine structure was detected in an *Mtb umaA* mutant, showing that both proteins are not functionally orthologous. Another MA-MT, the Hma (MmaA4) enzyme, is required for the biosynthesis of the keto- and methoxy-MAs produced by the *Mtb* complex, whose likely precursors are the hydroxyMAs [44–46,48,50,51]. A recent study proposed the *Mtb* Rv0132c protein as the missing hydroxyMA dehydrogenase (HMAD) that would convert the hydroxyMAs into ketoMAs using F420 deazaflavin coenzyme [52]. The formation of keto-MAs was observed after the coexpression of *Mtb hma* and *Rv0132c* genes in *M. smegmatis* that has distinct oxygenated MAs. Yet, previous work reported the presence of ketomycolic acids in *M. smegmatis* transformed by *hma* alone [44,49]. Furthermore, the heterologous expression of MA biosynthesis genes may lead to function misinterpretation [53]. Thus, validation of Rv0132c function awaits the phenotypic analysis of an *Mtb* Rv0132c mutant.

## Ultimate Biosynthesis Steps and Transfer onto Trehalose by the Mycolic Condensation System

The pivotal stage of MA biosynthesis is catalyzed by the mycolic condensation system that condenses a meromycolic chain and a carboxylated acyl chain resulting, after a reduction step, in the formation of the mycolic motif (Figure 2). An *in silico* analysis of mycobacterial genomes and phenotypic studies of corynebacterial and mycobacterial mutants led to the identification of the *fadD32-pks13-accD4* gene cluster involved in the mycolic condensation [16,17]. The different reaction steps catalyzed by the PKS Pks13 and the partner protein FadD32 have been thoroughly deciphered [54,55]. The FadD32-Pks13 pair appears as an atypical PKS performing a single Claisen-type condensation cycle between exceptionally long starter (meromycolic chain) and extender (carboxylated C₂₂–C₂₆ acyl chain) units (Figure 3) [54,56], whereas other PKSs universally use short building blocks such as malonyl-CoA and methyl-malonyl-CoA. Pks13 loads the extender unit onto its C-terminal ACP domain via its acyltransferase (AT) domain. The latter plays the gatekeeper role, selecting the appropriate long-chain 2-carboxyacyl-CoA substrates that are housed in the long hydrophobic channel of

Figure 3. Reaction Steps Catalyzed by the Mycolic Condensation System. A meromycolic acid (R₁ = C₃₅–C₇₁) produced by the FAS-II system is activated into meromycoloyl-AMP by the FadD32 adenylation enzyme (A) (step 1), which then loads the meromycoloyl chain onto the N-terminal ACP domain of Pks13 (step 2). This chain is transferred onto the ketosynthase (KS) domain (step 3). A fatty acyl-CoA (R₂ = C₂₀–C₂₄), synthesized by FAS-I system, is activated by a long-chain acyl-CoA carboxylase, most likely including AccA3 and AccD4 subunits (steps 1′ and 2′); the acyltransferase domain (AT) of Pks13 loads the resulting carboxyacyl chain (steps 3′) and transfers it onto the C-terminal ACP domain (step 4′). Then, the KS domain catalyzes a Claisen-type condensation between both fatty acyl chains (step 4), leading to the synthesis of an α-alkyl β-ketoacyl product bound to the C-terminal ACP domain. The thioesterase-like (TE) domain of Pks13 loads the condensation product onto its active site (step 5) and transfers it onto the acceptor trehalose via a transacylation mechanism (step 6). The CmrA enzyme reduces the β-keto function of the resulting intermediate to form the trehalose monomycolate (step 7).

the AT domain [56]. An array of genetic and biochemical data supports the involvement of AccA3 and AccD4 α- and β-subunits in the long-chain acyl-CoA carboxylase (ACCase) necessary for MA synthesis in mycobacteria (Figure 3) [16,57,58]. Interestingly, a lack of another β-subunit, AccD5, and of an Actinobacteria-typical ε-subunit, AccE5, both components of the ACCase5 complex involved in malonyl/methylmalonyl-CoA biosynthesis [58–60], resulted in a reduced MA production [60]. This suggested that AccD5 and/or AccE5 might have an additional role in the long-chain acyl-CoA carboxylation or be indirectly involved in MA biosynthesis through malonyl-CoA production.

730 Trends in Microbiology, September 2016, Vol. 24, No. 9
FadD32 (or FAAL32) belongs to the pool of mycobacterial fatty acyl-AMP ligases [55,61] and activates the meroMAs produced by FAS-II into meromycoloyl-AMPs (Figure 3), whose fatty acyl chain is buried in a hydrophobic tunnel recently observed in the crystal structures of FadD32 monomers in complex with alkyl-AMP inhibitors [62]. FadD32 is unique as it subsequently loads the meromycoloyl chain onto the N-terminal ACP domain of Pks13 (N-ACP<sub>Pks13</sub>), revealing an additional acyl-ACP ligase function [54,55]. Consistent with this, a putative phosphopantetheine binding site was recently identified in FadD32 [63]. This is reminiscent of the double function of adenylation and transfer described for some adenylation domains of nonribosomal peptide synthase (NRPS) and NRPS-PKS enzymes [64]. After transfer of the meromycoloyl chain onto its ketosynthase domain, Pks13 condenses both fatty acyl chains to produce an α-alkyl β-ketoacyl chain (Figure 3) [54]. Linear PKS products are generally released by the action of a C-terminus thioesterase (TE) domain via a hydrolysis mechanism. Given the high hydrophobicity of Pks13 products, it was hypothesized that they would not be released as free acids but directly transferred onto a hydrophilic acceptor unit by discrete unknown mycoloyltransferases [65]. A different reaction scheme was discovered, where the TE-like domain of Pks13 itself catalyzes the cleavage of the thioester bond with the condensation products and, in an original manner for a PKS TE domain, the intermolecular transfer of these chains preferentially onto trehalose, leading to the formation of α-alkyl β-ketoacyl trehalose (Figure 3) [66]. In agreement, the presence of a trehalose-binding pocket was predicted in the TE-like domain [66]. This work allowed elucidation of a long-sought step of the mycolate-containing compound biosynthesis pathway, that is, the covalent binding to trehalose. The mature MA chains are formed after the reduction of Pks13 products by the CmrA protein [67]. This nonessential enzyme was discovered through the deletion of candidate genes in *Corynebacterium* and *M.* *smegmatis*. The resulting mutants produced abnormal unreduced derivatives, including α-alkyl β-ketoacyl trehalose [67,68], suggesting that the reduction step occurs on this trehalose derivative leading to the synthesis of trehalose monomycolate (TMM) (Figure 3). So far, the archetypal building pattern of the complex lipids of the mycobacterial envelopes corresponded to the biosynthesis of the fatty acyl chains by a specific PKS, followed by their transfer onto the appropriate polyol moiety catalyzed by a dedicated discrete polyketide-associated protein (Pap)-type acyltransferase, whose gene is adjacent to the *pks* gene [69]. In the specific case of the mycolate-containing compounds, there is no Pap-coding gene in the neighborhood of *pks13*. Instead, Pks13 is equipped with a TE-like domain structurally distinct from the Pap enzymes and catalyzing a novel mechanism of lipid transfer in mycobacteria (Figure 3) [66].

In conclusion, the mycolic condensation system displays unique properties dedicated to the metabolism of the very-long-chain molecules that form the mycolic scaffold. It also catalyzes the pivotal link with the mycolate-containing compound biosynthesis, that is, the transfer of the unreduced mycoloyl chains onto trehalose.

## Export, Transfer, and Recycling

As major mycobacterial antigens, the three mycoloyltransferases of the antigen 85 complex, Ag85ABC (FbpABC), involved in the ultimate biosynthesis steps of the mycolate-containing compounds, were discovered in the late 1990s (for review, see [70]). These enzymes use TMM as a mycoloyl chain donor for the biosynthesis of the mAGP complex and the mycolate-containing lipids (Figure 1) located in the mycomembrane, including the trehalose dimycolate (TDM). However, the respective functions of the three Ag85ABC enzymes remain unclear [70]. The secreted mycoloyltransferases are present in both the culture filtrate and the outermost capsular layer of the *Mtb* envelope [71], but the physical separation of the corynebacterial outer membrane from the inner membrane led to the conclusion that part of the mycoloyltransferases presumably remains associated with the mycomembrane in this organism [72], suggesting a similar location of Ag85ABC in mycobacteria. Until recently, the routing process of the newly synthesized mycoloyl chains to the Ag85 complex in the envelope was completely unknown.

Figure 4. The fatty acid synthase type I (FAS-I) system synthesizes C₁₆–C₁₈ acyl-CoAs that are elongated by the FAS-II system into C₃₆–C₇₂ meromycolic chains differentiated by a family of methyltransferases (MA-MTs). The mycolic condensation system condenses the meromycolic chains to a C₂₂–C₂₆ acyl-CoA produced by the FAS-I system to form α-alkyl β-ketoacyl intermediates that are transferred onto the carrier trehalose and reduced to form TMM. The latter is exported to the periplasmic space by the RND superfamily transporter MmpL3. Then, TMM is probably routed to the Ag85ABC complex

(Figure legend continued on the bottom of the next page.)

732 Trends in Microbiology, September 2016, Vol. 24, No. 9
Molecules with potent bactericidal activities against *Mtb*, that is, an adamantyl urea and the antituberculous drug candidate SQ109, were shown to abolish the translocation of MAs to the envelope, resulting in the accumulation of TMM and a decrease in TDM and cell-wall-bound MAs, a phenotype also observed in conditional mycobacterial *mmpL3* mutants [73–75]. These molecules inhibit the resistance-nodulation-division (RND) superfamily transporter MmpL3, which is essential for viability and is responsible for the export of TMM (*Figure 4*, Key Figure), most likely by dissipating the transmembrane electrochemical proton gradient of the inner membrane where MmpL3 is located [86]. Unexpectedly, inactivation of the nonessential *M. smegmatis mmpL11* gene, located in the vicinity of *mmpL3*, hindered the export of distinct (mero)mycolate-containing compounds, the monomeromycoloyl diacylglycerol (MMDAG) and a newly identified mycolate ester wax (MEW), supporting a role of MmpL11 in the translocation of these molecules (*Figure 4*) [77]. In contrast to the *mmpL3* conditional mutant phenotype [73], there was an accumulation of mycolyl-mannosylphosphoheptaprenol (Myc-PL), suggesting that this phospholipid derivative might be a biosynthetic intermediate of MEW [77]. The link with MMDAG, carrying a simple meromycoloyl chain, is more difficult to establish. It is noteworthy that *mmpL11* inactivation had no impact on the TDM (*Figure 1*) and cell-wall-linked MA contents [77], showing that MmpL3 and MmpL11 are involved in two independent transport apparatuses. The direct biosynthetic link previously proposed between Myc-PL and the Ag85ABC products (TDM, mAGP) [78] seems inconsistent with these data. After binding TMM, the Ag85 complex transfers the mycoloyl chains onto selected acceptors, such as another TMM molecule, to form TDM, or the arabinogalactan, to form the mAGP complex (*Figure 1*), simultaneously releasing a trehalose molecule (*Figure 4*). The LpqY-SugABC ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter from *Mtb* mediates the retrograde transport of the extracellular released trehalose [79]. This recycling step is critical for *Mtb* virulence and might allow the trehalose to serve again as a carrier of MAs for the construction of the MA coat [89]. Moreover, a serine esterase (MSMEG_1529, TDM hydrolase) from *M. smegmatis* specifically cleaves the newly synthesized TDM to release free MAs in the extracellular matrix of mycobacteria grown as biofilms (*Figure 4*) [80]. No homologous enzyme has been described in *Mtb* yet. Interestingly, the mutation of the *mce1* operon in *Mtb* produces an accumulation of MAs in the culture supernatant, leading to a model where, similarly to trehalose recycling, free MAs would be recycled by the cell wall ABC transporter Mce1 to be used as substrates of lipid biosynthesis and/or as carbon sources under starvation conditions, according to the concept that pathogenic mycobacteria switch their metabolism from carbohydrate to lipid pathways during their intracellular life [81].

In conclusion, the RND superfamily transporter MmpL3 exports the mycoloyl chains carried by trehalose to the envelope for the biogenesis of the mycomembrane, and the formation of the extracellular matrix during biofilm growth. It has been proposed that the recycling of the free

mycoloyltransferases, presumably associated with the outer membrane (mycomembrane), by an unknown transport system potentially made of homologues of membrane fusion-like proteins (MFP) and a channel-forming outer-membrane factor (OMF), which are known to constitute tripartite transport systems with RND-type transporters. The Ag85ABC complex metabolizes TMM into biologically active mycolate-containing compounds, that is, the mAGP complex and TDM, which constitute major components of the mycomembrane, and more scarcely the GMM and GroMM. The released free trehalose may be recycled by the LpqY-SugA-SugB-SugC ABC transporter to potentially serve again as a carrier of MAs for mycomembrane biogenesis. The TDM hydrolase releases free MAs in the extracellular matrix of mycobacteria grown as biofilms. Free MAs might also be recycled by the ABC transporter Mce1 to be used as substrates of lipid biosynthesis and/or as carbon sources under starvation conditions. Other mycolate-related derivatives, that is, the MEW (potentially formed from Myc-PL intermediate) and MMDAG (not drawn), are likely exported by the RND superfamily transporter Mmpl11.

# Concluding Remarks and Future Perspectives

Recent work has allowed elucidation of important missing steps, drawing a more comprehensive scheme of both biosynthesis and export pathways of the mycolate-containing compounds (Figure 4). Yet, critical questions remain (see Outstanding Questions). Some particular steps of the biosynthesis are still obscure, notably the mechanism of introduction of double bonds in the meromycolic chain and the precise subunit composition of the long-chain acyl-CoA carboxylase (see above). Furthermore, the question of the places of the (mero)mycolic derivatives Myc-PL, MMDAG, and MEW within the mycolic metabolism is raised, in particular their formation mechanism and the relationship with the known biosynthesis enzymes. Gaps also remain in the knowledge of the MA export apparatus. The mechanisms by which the MA derivatives are routed from the periplasmic side of the inner membrane transporters MmpL3 and MmpL11 to envelope outer layers (like the mycomembrane) or the bacterial surface have not been investigated yet. The very important issue remains to be explored of whether mycobacteria possess periplasmic membrane fusion-like proteins (MFPs) and channel-forming outer-membrane factors that, together with RND-type transporters, constitute tripartite transport systems that allow extrusion of substrates through the inner and outer membranes (Figure 4) similar to Gram-negative bacteria [82]. The properties of some mycobacterial MmpS transmembrane proteins suggest that they may be functional homologues of MFPs [83,84]. Moreover, the region between the *mmpL3* and *mmpL11* genes encodes two putative transmembrane proteins, Rv0204c and Rv0205, which might be partners of the MA transport systems [75]. The 3D structures of the MA biosynthesis and export machineries should also represent a future field of investigation that might lead to the development of alternative therapeutic strategies based on the inhibition of the assembly of protein complexes. The atomic structures of many individual proteins of MA biosynthesis and transfer have been solved [32,33,45,46,62,63,85–96]. Protein pair interactions within the FAS-II system have been deciphered in a yeast heterologous environment leading to a global interactome model that proposes the existence of interconnected specialized complexes [42,43,97]. Furthermore, a 3D reconstruction of the mycobacterial FAS-I multifunctional enzyme was performed by cryoelectron microscopy [98,99]. Yet, the 3D structures of the other native multienzyme complexes involved in MA metabolism remain unknown. The important advances in the technique of single-particle electron microscopy combined with image processing should greatly promote this type of investigation. The precise location of the MA biosynthesis machinery within the subcellular compartments, and the likely functional coupling of the diverse involved systems with each other and the export apparatuses, are also poorly understood. Both FAS-II enzymes and MA biosynthesis activity have been detected in mycobacterial membrane-containing cell-wall fractions [100–102]. Furthermore, recent data strongly suggest that the synthesis of the MA unreduced forms occurs in the same compartment as the transfer onto trehalose since they are both catalyzed by Pks13 (see above) [66]. The involvement of MmpL3 and LpqY-SugABC inner membrane transporters in the export of TMM and recycling of trehalose, respectively [73–75,79], implies that the TMM is formed on the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane. Altogether, these data suggest that the MA biosynthesis machinery would be associated with the plasma membrane (Figure 4). More generally, there is a growing line of evidence suggesting that MmpL proteins may be involved in the formation of membrane-associated scaffolds that facilitate the coupling of lipid biosynthesis with transport [103]. Consistent with this, Ag85ABC, MmpL3, and FAS-II system components were all shown to localize at the septa and/or the poles of mycobacteria [104,105]. Yet, demonstration of the existence of a functional mycolate-containing compound biosynthesis/transport megacomplex still requires a thorough study of the interactions between the different biosynthesis and transport molecular actors and their impact on the metabolic turnover.

**Outstanding Questions**

What are the missing steps of the MA biosynthesis pathway? In particular, what is the mechanism of double bond introduction into the meromycolic chain, and at which steps are they modified into functions? What is the exact composition of the long-chain acyl-CoA carboxylase complex involved in the mycolic condensation system?

What is the precise subcellular localization of the (mero)mycolic derivatives Myc-PL, MMDAG, and MEW, and what are their places within the mycolate-containing compound metabolism? Especially, what are the mechanisms of formation of these molecules, their metabolic link, and the relationship with the known biosynthesis enzymes?

How are MA derivatives routed from the periplasmic side of the inner membrane transporters MmpL3 and MmpL11 to the envelope outer layers (like the mycomembrane) or the bacterial surface? Are these transporters involved in tripartite transport systems?

What are the 3D structures of the MA biosynthesis and export machineries? This field of investigation may open new avenues for the development of TB drug candidates blocking the assembly of protein complexes required for these pathways.

What is the precise location of the MA biosynthesis machinery within the subcellular compartments? Does it form a functional megacomplex with the MA export apparatuses? The subcellular organization of these pathways and their functional interplay are fundamental issues for effective drug design.

What are the regulation processes of the MA metabolism involved in adapting the production level and the fine structure of these envelope components, in response to environmental conditions, notably during infection? This issue is of paramount importance for understanding the intricate network of events governing the host-pathogen dialogue and involving the MAs.

Another avenue for future research relates to the mechanisms of regulation of the MA metabolism involved in adapting the production level and the fine structure of these envelope components in response to environmental conditions. Only fragmented information is currently available. A very recent survey has revealed that, when bacteria encounter starvation conditions during infection, this leads to a global downregulation, partially mediated by the stringent response, of genes required for MA biosynthesis and transport, likely to slow down this highly energy-consuming process during nutrient scarcity [106]. Until now, two types of regulation mechanism have been described. Post-translational modifications using a Ser/Thr protein kinase (STPK)-mediated phosphorylation conduct a tight regulation of FAS-II enzymes (Figure 2) [18,19,23,107–109]. Additionally, a few transcriptional regulators of MA metabolism have been identified, such as FasR that controls *fas* (*FAS-I* gene) expression, and FadR and MabR that are repressors of the *fasII* operon [110–112].

In the context of multidrug resistance, that severely compromises conventional TB chemotherapy [113], the development of a new generation of efficient drugs is a major concern. The research on MA metabolism might have important applications since it represents a valuable source of pharmacological targets. Novel, promising drug candidates targeting MA metabolism are already in the pipeline, especially with the current use of whole-cell screening in addition to the more conventional target-based high-throughput screening strategy [114].
