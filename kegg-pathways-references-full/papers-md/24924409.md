Abstract

Protease activated receptors (PARs) are a small family of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) mediating the cellular effects of some proteases of the coagulation system, such as thrombin, or other proteases, such as trypsin or metalloproteinase 1. As the prototype of PARs, PAR1 is a seven transmembrane GPCR that, upon cleavage by thrombin, unmasks a new amino-terminus able to bind intramolecularly to PAR1 itself thus inducing signaling. In the vascular system, thrombin and other proteases of the coagulation-fibrinolysis system, such as plasmin, factor VIIa and factor Xa, activated protein C, are considered physiologically relevant agonists, and PARs appear to largely account for the cellular effects of these enzymes. In the vasculature, PARs are expressed on platelets, endothelial cells (ECs) and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). In the vessel wall, under physiological conditions, PARs are mainly expressed in ECs and participate in the regulation of vascular tone, by inducing endothelium-dependent relaxation. PAR activation on ECs promotes conversion of these cells into a proinflammatory phenotype, causes increase of vascular permeability, and the exposure/secretion of proteins and cytokines mediating the local accumulation of platelets and leukocytes. These effects contribute to the vascular consequences of sepsis and of diseases such as acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome. In normal arteries PARs are to a much lesser amount expressed on VSMCs. However, in conditions associated with endothelial dysfunction, PARs mediate contraction, proliferation, migration, hypertrophy of VSMCs and their production of extracellular matrix, thereby contributing to the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis and hypertension. Inhibition of proteases-PARs interaction might thus become a potential therapeutic target in various vascular diseases.

# 1. Introduction

The serine protease thrombin plays a central role in the coagulation cascade and thrombosis. Thrombin is one of the most powerful physiological agonist in the cardiovascular system, and its actions are crucial for both atherosclerosis and its thrombotic consequences. Thrombin converts fibrinogen to fibrin, which is essential for providing the meshwork for clot formation.

In addition, thrombin also stimulates a wide range of cell types in blood and in the vasculature, including platelets, endothelial cells (ECs) and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Therefore, thrombin acts both as an enzyme and as a receptor agonist. However, thrombin does not behave as a traditional agonist, as the catalytic activity of the enzyme is necessary to elicit the effects on cells. In fact, most of the cellular effects of thrombin are initiated via activation of a family of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) termed protease-activated receptors (PARs). These receptors are characterized by a unique mechanism of activation, whereby the receptor undergoes proteolytic cleavage unmasking a new tethered aminoterminal (N-terminus) which auto-activates the receptor itself [1].

In this issue of *Vascular Pharmacology*, Gonzales et al. show that thrombin-induced increased endothelial permeability can be attenuated by heparin and a desulfated heparin molecule with low anticoagulant activity (ODSH) in a PAR-dependent manner [2]. The increased endothelial permeability by thrombin is relevant in severe human diseases such as acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Therefore, understanding the role of thrombin and PARs in the vasculature under physiological conditions and in diseases can be important for the clinical development of new therapeutic strategies.

The purpose of this review is therefore to briefly describe how PARs signal to vascular cells upon protease activation and their role in regulating vascular function under physiological and pathological conditions. Much knowledge has been acquired so far on thrombin and its major receptor PAR1 in normal and pathologic vessels. However, the other PARs and the proteases signaling through these

receptors, other than thrombin, will also be described. The potential role of PARs as pharmacological targets in human vascular diseases will be discussed as well.

2. Protease Activated Receptors

2.1 Mechanism of PAR1 activation

In addition to cleaving fibrinogen and other soluble protein substrates, the protease thrombin triggers several responses in cells such as platelets, endothelial cells and other cells, thus behaving like a traditional hormone. How thrombin elicits cellular responses and regulates cellular behavior, by exerting its enzymatic activity, was a vexed question until the discovery of PARs. In 1991 Coughlin and coworkers used an expression cloning screen in Xenopus oocytes to identify the first thrombin receptor, a seven-member transmembrane GPCR characterized by a novel signaling mechanism, unique among GPCRs [3]. Initially, mRNA from cells highly responsive to thrombin was injected into Xenopus oocytes and the response to thrombin assayed. Fractionation of the mRNA encoding the receptor led to the construction of a size-specific cDNA library. By injecting *in vitro* transcribed cRNA into Xenopus oocytes and functionally assaying the responses to thrombin, eventually a single cDNA species was isolated which, when assayed in oocytes, displayed a strong and specific response to thrombin rather than trypsin [3]. This cloned thrombin receptor was henceforth identified as PAR1.

PAR1, the prototype of a small family of PARs, is activated when thrombin cleaves its N-terminal exodomain at a specific cleavage site, between residues Arg 41 and Ser 42. Cleavage by thrombin unmasks a new N-terminus, which acts as a tethered ligand, binding intramolecularly to the body of the receptor to effect transmembrane signaling (Fig. 1). A synthetic peptide mimicking the first six amino acids of the new N-terminus generated by the thrombin cleavage, SFLLRN—also known as thrombin-activated peptide (TRAP)—can activate PAR1 independent of protease activity and receptor cleavage. The novelty of the mechanism of PAR1 activation, in comparison with that of all other known receptors, is that in this case

the receptor itself carries its own ligand, which is unmasked only upon enzymatic cleavage by thrombin at a specific site.

The 51-63PAR1 region is rich in anionic residues and has a sequence resembling the C-terminal tail of the leech anticoagulant hirudin. This sequence is the primary binding site between PAR1 and the anion binding exosite I of thrombin (Fig. 2), and substantially increases the cleavage of PAR1 at low concentrations of thrombin. In fact, the kcat/Km value for the PAR1 hydrolysis is increased 100-fold in the presence of the hirudin-like domain [4].

Once ligated by the new N-terminus, PAR1 can activate heterotrimeric G proteins of the G12/13, Gq and Gi/z families to involve a substantial network of signaling pathways [5]. The α-subunits of G12 and 13 mediate cytoskeletal responses that likely induce the shape change in platelets [6] and increased permeability and migration in ECs [7] through small G-proteins such as Rho. Gaq activates phospholipase Cβ, triggering phosphoinositide hydrolysis, calcium mobilization and activation of protein kinase C [8]. This pathway mediates responses ranging from granule secretion to integrin activation and aggregation in platelets, and transcriptional responses in endothelial and mesenchymal cells through Ca-regulated kinases and phosphatases, as well as MAP kinase cassettes. Gai signaling in platelets mediates adenylate cyclase inhibition, which can also be mediated by PAR1-mediated ADP secretion and P2Y12 activation. Gβγ subunits can activate phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3-kinase) and other lipid modifying enzymes, protein kinases and channels [9]. PI3-kinase modifies the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane to provide the attachment and recruitment of several signaling proteins [10]. Therefore, PAR1 coupling to Gq, G13 and Gz may account for most of pleiotropic effects of thrombin on cells.

### 2.2 A family of PARs

After the discovery of the first thrombin receptor, now named PAR1, it was surprising to find out that platelets from PAR1 deficient mice responded strongly to thrombin [11] and the search for a second receptor for thrombin, at least in mice, began. On the contrary, human PAR1 was able to elicit most of thrombin responses
in platelets. A second proteolytically activated seven transmembrane GPCR, whose  
DNA was isolated from a mouse genomic library and expressed in Xenopus  
oocytes, was identified and named PAR2 [12]. PAR2 could not be activated by  
thrombin, but it was activated by low dose of trypsin. A polymerase chain reaction  
(PCR)-based strategy yielded a new human complementary DNA encoding a  
putative GPCR with 27% amino-acid sequence similarity to the PAR1 and 28%  
similarity to PAR2, identifying what is now called PAR3 [13]. This new GPCR was  
cleavable by thrombin, triggered signaling in cells transfected with PAR3 cDNA, and  
was expressed in human bone marrow and in mouse megakaryocytes. However,  
thrombin responses in platelets from PAR3-deficient mice were markedly  
diminished, but not abolished [14]. Therefore, a new thrombin-activated receptor  
was sought and identified. A GenBank Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST,  
finding regions of local similarity between sequences) search for PAR-related  
sequences revealed a cDNA containing a sequence encoding for a region highly  
conserved among PARs. The full length complementary DNA encoded a 397-  
amino-acid protein, now designated PAR4, with 30% amino-acid sequence identity  
to PAR3. Expression of PAR4 in Xenopus oocytes and functional studies revealed  
that PAR4 mediated thrombin responses, and that it functioned as a second  
thrombin receptor both in mouse and in human platelets [14].  

In summary, four PARs have been identified in mammalian genome so  
far. PAR1, PAR2, PAR3, PAR4 differ for their agonist specificity and signaling.  
PARs can be, in fact, activated by enzymes of the coagulation-fibrinolysis system or  
protease released by inflammatory and immune cells, such as mast cell tryptase,  
neutrophil cathepsin G, or T-lymphocyte derived granzyme A (Table 1).  
Human PAR1 [3], PAR3 [13] and PAR4 [14] can be activated by thrombin.  
On ECs, PAR1 can be cleaved by activated protein C (APC) in the presence of the  
endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR) [15]. PAR1 is also cleaved by plasmin [16],  
cathepsin G [17], matrix metalloproteinase 1 [18], trypsin, tryptase [19], and the  
ternary complex TF/FVIIa/FXa [20]. PAR2 is the only PAR not cleaved by  
thrombin, but it is effectively cleaved by trypsin [12] and tryptase [21], as well as by  
coagulation factors VIIa and Xa in binary complex or in a ternary complex with TF  [22], the membrane-bound serine proteases MTSPi [23] and TMPRSS2 [24]. PAR 3 is cleaved by thrombin [13]. PAR 4 is cleaved by thrombin [14], plasmin [25], trypsin [14], and cathepsin G [26].

The N-terminal exodomains of PAR1 and PAR3 have the hirudin-like thrombin binding domain C-terminal to the thrombin cleavage site (Fig. 1). This domain is important as it mediates high affinity binding to the exosite I of thrombin (Fig. 2), thus allowing receptor cleavage at low concentrations of thrombin. The presence of the hirudin-like domain in PAR1 and PAR3 suggests that these receptors evolved to mediate responses to thrombin vs other proteases. A hirudin-like sequence is not present in PAR2 or PAR4. In fact, PAR2 is not cleaved by thrombin and PAR4 requires higher concentrations for activation than PAR1.

Activation of PARs results in a multitude of cellular signaling events. Of the four major $G_{\alpha}$ protein subclasses, PAR1 and PAR2 have been shown to signal through $G_{q}$, $G_{i}$ and $G_{12/13}$, PAR3 through $G_{q}$ and PAR4 through $G_{q}$ and $G_{12/13}$ [27] although the coupling of PAR1 and PAR4 to $G_{i}$ remains controversial [28, 29].

For each PAR, synthetic peptides, mimicking the new N-terminus acting as tethered ligands, can be used to activate the PAR itself. Such peptide agonists have provided ready-to-use tools for probing the effects of PAR activation *in vitro* and *in vivo*. The most potent and specific peptide agonists are SFFLRN-NH₂ (TRAP), SLIGKV-NH₂, AYPGKF-NH₂ for human PAR1, PAR2 and PAR4, respectively. In contrast to other PARs, synthetic peptides mimicking the new N-terminus of mouse and human PAR3 are not useful experimentally. Activation of mouse PAR3 fails to elicit a signal regardless of the mode of activation [13] and the tethered ligand sequence for PAR3, TFRGAP-NH₂, has been shown to activate PAR1 [30, 31].

3. PARs in vascular physiology

3.1 Vascular PARs

6
ECs express PAR1, PAR2 and PAR4 [32]. VSMCs express PAR1 and PAR2, although their expression in normal arteries is low [33] [34]. Human platelets express PAR1 and PAR4 [1]. When considering the effects of thrombin in the vasculature, mostly the expression of PAR1 and PAR4 on these cells has to be taken into account to evaluate the role of each cell in the events elicited by thrombin in vivo. PAR1 is the main receptor for thrombin on vessels and on platelets, and therefore its function will be mainly addressed here. PAR2 is not cleaved by thrombin, however its role in vascular biology and in inflammation is pivotal, and this will also be discussed.

### 3.2 Platelet PARs

Thrombin is the most effective activator of platelets and causes platelet shape change and secretion, synthesis and release of thromboxane A₂, mobilization of P-selectin, activation of αⅡbβ₃ and, ultimately, platelet aggregation. PAR1 is the main platelet receptor for thrombin, and activates platelets at subnanomolar concentrations, whereas PAR4-mediated platelet activation requires higher thrombin concentrations [1, 5]. Antagonists of PAR—termed paxars—have been developed and tested as antiplatelet drugs in cardiovascular diseases in phase III clinical trials [35, 36] (see Section 6 below).

The role of PARs in platelet function and their involvement in hemostasis and arterial thrombosis is not the main interest of this review, and a series of comprehensive review articles are recommended for more information on such topics [1, 5, 37].

### 3.3 Effects of thrombin on vascular PARs

When thrombin is used in cultured ECs, PAR1 activation stimulates the production of prostacyclin and nitric oxide (NO) [38], causes cell retraction and change in monolayer permeability [39], and mobilization of von Willebrand factor (vWF) and P-selectin from Weibel-Palade bodies [5].
In cultured VSMCs thrombin, via PAR1 activation, stimulates proliferation [33], contraction [40], hypertrophy [41], extracellular matrix production [42] and the release of cytokines and mitogenic growth factors [43].

When assessed in situ using intact artery preparations, the global effects of thrombin on the vessels are: i) changes of the vessel tone; ii) release of endothelium-derived relaxing factors and proteins from Weibel-Palade bodies; iii) increased vascular permeability and iv) production of cytokines by fibroblasts and VSMCs.

### 3.3.1 Effects of thrombin on the vessel tone

Thrombin has been known to cause endothelium-dependent arterial vasodilation since the early 1980s [44]. Since PAR1 was cloned, many studies established that thrombin activation of PAR1 causes arterial vasodilation. Most of such studies were performed in vitro, using isolated coronary rings, or in vivo using animal models of dogs or rodents [45]. The role of PAR1 in the human vasculature was shown for the first time by demonstrating that infusion of a PAR1 activating peptide in normal human brachial arteries produced arterial vasodilation, venoconstriction, activation of platelets and the release of tissue-type plasminogen activator (r-PA) [46]. In a subsequent study, the same authors demonstrated that in vivo denudation of human venous endothelium did not change PAR1 mediated venoconstriction, suggesting a direct effect of PAR1 on the VSMCs. On the contrary, a PAR1 activating peptide caused in vivo potent arterial vasodilation by promoting the release of endothelium-derived relaxing factors (EDRF), thus decreasing the tone of VSMCs. Among EDRFs, NO and endothelial-derived hyperpolarizing factors resulted mostly responsible for the endothelial dependent arterial vasodilation, whereas prostacyclin seemed not to be involved [47]. Therefore, in humans venoconstriction is caused by a PAR1 direct effect on VSMCs, whereas arterial vasodilation is caused by thrombin action on PAR1 ECs, promoting the release of vasodilating mediators. Further demonstration that PAR1 activation in the vasculature normally causes endothelium-dependent, nitric-oxide-mediated vasodilation comes from the evidence that PAR1 activators cause acutehypotension when administered intravenously to mice [48]. ECs are considered the primary cells mediating the vascular effects of PARs in normal arteries. On the contrary, the effects of PAR1 on VSMCs may play a minor functional role in normal arteries.

### 3.3.2 Effects of thrombin on the release of proteins

In addition to vasomotion, PAR1 activation *in vivo* causes the release of endothelium-derived coagulant and fibrinolytic factors. PAR1 agonists cause endothelial tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) release, which is increased in the presence of inhibition of endogenous NO production [47]; vWF, which is stored within the Weibel-Palade bodies, is also secreted upon PAR1. The relevance of this PAR1 effect on vWF *in vivo* is debated. In fact, in some *in vitro* studies a robust release of vWF has been reported in human vascular endothelial cells (HUVEC) [49], whereas in other studies the *in vivo* activation of PAR1 in the human forearm model did not demonstrate any release of vWF [47]. Activation of PAR1 also triggers the exposure of P-selectin to promote rolling and adhesion of platelets and leukocytes on the endothelial surface [50].

### 3.3.3 Effects of thrombin on vascular permeability

Acute PAR1 activation has been shown to cause increase in vascular permeability and edema formation in animal models [39], presumably due to direct endothelial contraction responses (Fig. 1). This PAR1 mediated endothelial response contributes to inflammation in endotoxemia and sepsis (see Section 5 below), and therefore participates in pro-inflammatory, proapoptotic and barrier-disruptive effects of thrombin on ECs. At the same time, ECs express on their surface the effectors of a pathway exerting anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective properties. The EPCR, acting as a coreceptor for APC, elicits its anti-inflammatory, cytoprotective and barrier-stabilizing signaling through PAR1 [51] (Fig. 3). This will be further discussed in Section 5 below.
3.3.4 Effects of thrombin on the production of cytokines by VSMCs and fibroblasts

In VSMCs and fibroblasts, PAR activation triggers growth factor [43] and extracellular matrix production [42], responses that, together with migration and proliferation [33], most probably have a role in tissue remodeling. However, the expression and possible physiological role of PARs on VSMCs in normal vessels are limited. VSMCs PARs are conversely upregulated in vascular lesions, and appear to have a greater role in the pathogenesis of vascular lesions. This will be discussed in Section 4 below.

3.3.5 Role of endothelial PAR1 in vasculogenesis

Constitutive endothelial PAR1 activation seems to play a key role in vasculogenesis, at least in mice. In fact, approximately half of PAR1-deficient mouse embryos die at midgestation for severe defects in blood vessel formation [11]. This phenotype can be rescued by replacing PAR1 expression in ECs alone [52]. Therefore, PAR1 signaling in ECs is necessary for proper vessel development. Whether this is mediated by thrombin activation of PAR1 is unknown. The relevance of PAR1 in vasculogenesis in humans is also unknown.

4. PARs in vascular pathophysiology

Under pathological conditions, such as thrombosis, hemorrhage, inflammation, or tissue damage, proteases of the coagulation-fibrinolytic system and proteases derived from immune and inflammatory cells are activated. Therefore, the vascular effects of proteases and, as a consequence, of PARs are prominent in those conditions. Activation of vascular PARs in these conditions can induce acute responses (such as increase of endothelial permeability or release of cytokines) or regulation of the expression of a wide range of genes both in ECs and in VSMCs. In general, in injured vessels, the role of VSMC PARs becomes more relevant than in normal vessels.

4.1 Endothelial PARs in vascular pathophysiology
In cultured ECs thrombin upregulates or downregulates the expression of multiple genes. These changes of gene expressions correspond to a switch of ECs to a proinflammatory phenotype. In fact, the expression of genes related to angiogenesis and cell growth (vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, angiopoietin, platelet-derived growth factors), hemostasis (tissue factor [TF], PAI-1), cytokines and chemokines (interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1) and cell-adhesion (vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1, E-selectin) have been shown to be upregulated by thrombin [53].

Acute PAR1 activation causes an increase in vascular permeability, presumably due to direct endothelial contractile responses. Additional pro-inflammatory effects of endothelial PAR1 activation include the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and increased surface expression of adhesion molecules, in turn promoting platelet and leukocyte margination [54]. In this regard, the study of PAR-deficient mice provided a useful tool to test the role of these receptors in inflammatory responses. PAR1-deficiency and blockade protect against leukocyte infiltration and renal damage in a model of antibody-mediated glomerulonephritis [55], and PAR1 deficiency reduced restenosis in artery injury models [48]. PAR1 deficiency and blockade reduced inflammation in mouse models of colitis [56]. Altogether these findings point to a role for PAR1 in mediating acute vascular inflammation. The role of PARs in sepsis will be discussed in Section 5 below.

### 4.2 VSMC PARs in vascular pathophysiology

It is well established that, contrary to ECs, the expression of PAR1 and PAR2 is quite limited in normal VSMCs, whereas they both are upregulated in VSMCs of vascular lesions [31, 53]. This suggests that PARs on VSMCs play a more important role under pathological than normal conditions, especially in vascular lesions associated with thrombus formation. In strips isolated from normal human coronary arteries, the stimulation of PAR1 induces endothelium-dependent relaxation. In the presence of atherosclerotic lesions, such endothelium-induced relaxation is attenuated. In advanced atherosclerotic lesions associated with wall thickening, the vasorelaxing response eventually disappears and vessel wall
contraction becomes predominant [57]. Matching this observation, it was shown that the expression of PAR1 was limited to ECs in normal arteries, whereas it was found on VSMCs and macrophages of the vessel wall, in addition to ECs, in atherosclerotic lesions [58]. As a consequence, PAR1-mediated effects on VSMCs, such as contraction, migration, proliferation, hypertrophy, release of cytokines and production of extracellular matrix become predominant in vascular lesions.

Therefore, the upregulation of PAR1 (and also PAR2) in VSMCs is considered a key mechanism for the development of vascular lesions and for the increased vascular tone occurring through these receptors.

In addition to atherosclerosis, hypertension has been associated with the upregulation of PAR1 in VSMCs. In aortic VSMCs from rats with angiotensin II-induced hypertension PAR1 was found increased 10 fold relative to controls [59]. Increased PAR1 expression was shown in denuded rat aortic ring preparations in vitro and suggested that changes in VSMCs PAR1 expression are responsible, at least in part, for mediating the hypertensive effects of angiotensin II [59].

Another condition associated with a rapid and marked increase of PAR1 expression in medial VSMCs is balloon-catheter induced injury in rats and baboon arteries, suggesting that the receptor may be involved in lesion formation and progression in response to injury [60]. Vasodilatory prostaglandins can downregulate the expression of PAR1 on human VSMCs in culture, therefore showing a further level of control of mitogenic effects of thrombin via PAR1 [61].

Altogether, these findings suggest that PAR1 activation in normal arteries causes endothelium-dependent, NO-mediated vasodilation. In pathologic conditions, such as atherosclerosis, hypertension, or balloon-catheter injury or other pro-inflammatory conditions, PAR1 is upregulated on VSMCs, and this causes PAR1-mediated contraction and may also contribute to restenosis. The understanding of the molecular mechanisms responsible for changes in expression of PARs in vascular lesions is still however not completely elucidated. Identification of underlying mechanisms might contribute to the development of new pharmacological strategies for the treatment of vascular diseases.

4.3 Role of other PARs

PAR2 is distinct from other PAR receptors as it is the only member of the PAR family not cleaved by thrombin and cleaved by other proteases (see Section 2.2 above). PAR2 is expressed on cultured human VSMCs and ECs. Activation of PAR2 has similar effects as the activation of PAR1. Similarly to activators of PAR1, activators of PAR2 also induce endothelium-dependent vascular relaxation in several animal species, such as rat [62], mouse [63] and pig [64]. In vivo, PAR2 activation induces hypotensive responses in rats [65] and mice [66]. In contrast to these animal models, PAR2 activation causes endothelium-dependent NO-mediated relaxation of human artery preparations only after inflammatory injury [67]. The acute activation of PAR2 in HUVECs causes the release of vWF and induces the expression of TF. The activation of PAR2 induces proliferation of cultured human VSMCs and HUVECs.

Changes in PAR2 expression have been reported in conditions associated with inflammatory stimuli. In fact, PAR2 is upregulated in cultured HUVECs by inflammatory mediators such as IL1α and TNFα. Vascular PAR2 expression is upregulated in rats treated with lipopolysaccharide. In agreement with these findings, an increased vasodilatory response is present upon PAR2 agonist administration in vivo [68]. Interestingly, it has been recently reported that chronic in-vivo activation of PAR2 lowers systolic blood pressure in unrestrained mice; however, this effect was shown to be counteracted by receptor desensitization and the concomitant development of endothelial and vascular dysfunction [69]. PAR2 expression is upregulated in the rat aorta also in response to oxidative stress [70]. PAR2-deficient mice show protection against inflammation in models of arthritis [71] and dermatitis [72]. Altogether, these findings suggest that vascular PAR2 plays a role in responses induced by coagulation proteases during inflammation and, possibly, angiogenesis.

In comparison with PAR1 and PAR2, little is known of the function of PAR3 and PAR4 in the vasculature. PAR4 is expressed on mouse ECs and contributes to responses to thrombin in such cells. PAR4 activation causes endothelium-

dependent relaxation of the rat aorta in a manner similar to that observed with PAR1 and PAR2 activation. However, as with PAR2, such responses are only present in human artery preparations treated with inflammatory mediators. Interestingly, the exposure of human VSMCs in culture to high glucose concentrations increases the expression and function of PAR4 on these cells, suggesting a potential role for PAR4 in diabetic vasculopathy [73].

5. PARs in sepsis, acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome

Sepsis is a systemic response to infections, and its signs and symptoms are produced by the activation of host defense mechanisms rather than by the invading pathogens themselves. In sepsis, systemic inflammation leads to activation of the coagulation system and to fibrin deposition, as an attempt to contain the invading microorganism and the subsequent inflammatory response. This latter induces the release of a large number of host-derived mediators, including cytokines, chemokines and products of the complement system that activate ECs. As a consequence, one of the hallmarks of sepsis is microvascular dysfunction, in which endothelial activation and dysfunction appear to play a pivotal role [74]. The endothelium responds to inflammatory mediators with structural changes, such as cytoplasmic swelling and detachment, or with functional changes, such as the expression of adhesion molecules, resulting in increased platelet adhesion and trafficking.

An important feature of endothelial dysfunction in sepsis is increased vascular permeability (Fig. 3), resulting in a redistribution of body fluid, and edema. Fluid leakage from the intravascular space contributes to hypovolemia and hypotension, which are important signs of sepsis. In addition, in sepsis the endothelium features a prothrombotic phenotype, which is critically involved in the detrimental cascade leading to multiple organ failure (Fig. 3).

Endothelial PARs play important roles in the crosstalk between coagulation and inflammation in sepsis. As coagulation is activated by the induction of TF on monocytes, thrombin is ultimately produced, and exerts proinflammatory actions by
activating PAR1 on ECs. In addition, the ternary complex TF/FVIIa/FXa activates both PAR1 and PAR2 on ECs [20, 75, 76] (Fig. 3). As reported in Section 4 above, several evidences for a role of PARs in promoting inflammation have accumulated in the last years. However, in the setting of sepsis, some conflicting results have been reported *in vivo*. In fact, in mouse models of endotoxemia, PAR1- and PAR2-deficient mice were not protected against death [77]. However, in the presence of the specific inhibitor hirudin, both PAR1 and PAR2 deficient mice showed decreased cytokine production compared to their wild-type littermates [77]. Therefore, it is possible that activation of multiple PARs and fibrin formation together contribute to enhance inflammation during sepsis.

In primary ECs, APC bound to EPCR switches the specificity of PAR1-thrombin signaling to mediate protective anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective properties [78-80] (Fig. 3). APC also promotes the enhancement of endothelial barrier *in vitro* in an EPCR- and PAR-1-dependent manner, a property that may be of special interest given the central role of the loss of such barrier function in sepsis. Recombinant human (rh) APC (drotrecogin alpha-activated) was developed for clinical use in patients with severe sepsis. It was proved to be the first drug to reduce 28-day mortality of patients with severe sepsis/septic shock [81]. However, the increased risk of bleeding and the negative results of additional clinical trials have eventually casted doubts on the net clinical benefit of rh-APC, and the drug was withdrawn from development [82]. Whether the anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and barrier-stabilizing properties of APC are mediated also by PAR-1 is still a matter of debate [83]. However, APC loses its beneficial effects on survival and on vascular permeability in PAR1 deficient mice exposed to LPS [84].

Endothelial barrier dysfunction is an important contributor to the pathogenesis of acute lung injury (ALI) and the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), two conditions associated with respiratory failure and 30-50% mortality. In the acute phase there is here evidence of interstitial and alveolar edema, endothelial and epithelial injury, increased endothelial permeability, intra-alveolar and intravascular fibrin deposition. Activation of coagulation is both a consequence and a contributor to ALI/ARDS, since a pro-coagulant state results in intra-alveolar

15
fibrin deposition, which enhances inflammation. Furthermore, thrombin is massively generated during ALI and has direct effects on vascular permeability by disrupting the integrity of EC junctions.

As already detailed, PAR1 is the main receptor involved in thrombin-induced endothelial barrier permeability. Therefore, it is conceivable that the thrombin-induced activation of PAR1 of pulmonary artery ECs and/or lung microvascular ECs may become an attractive target for the therapy of ALI/ARDS.

6. Vascular PARs as therapeutic targets for vascular diseases

Inhibition of the vascular effects of PARs may provide new therapeutic strategies for the prevention and treatment of vascular diseases. These may be potentially useful in acute processes, such as in ALI/ARDS, in which thrombin forming at sites of vascular injury causes edema via endothelial cell retraction and promotes inflammatory cell adhesion and infiltration. It might also be potentially useful in inhibiting the mitogenic and contractile effects of thrombin on VSMCs via PAR1, which contribute to atherosclerosis, hypertension and restenosis after balloon-catheter injury. In this regard, inhibition of PAR1 reduces neointimal formation after balloon-catheter injury of porcine coronary arteries [85]. Also, vascular injury-induced neointimal formation is markedly reduced in PAR1 knockout mice [48]. As a result, inhibiting the acute vascular effects of PARs and/or preventing the upregulation of PARs in vascular lesions may provide new therapeutic strategies for prevention and treatment of vascular diseases.

Several anti-PAR1 antagonists with different chemical structures have been developed and used as antithrombotic drugs for the treatment and/or prevention of arterial thrombosis in phase III clinical trials. Vorapaxar (SCH 530348), and atopaxar (E5555) are two anti-PAR1 drugs that have shown effective anti-platelet activity, counteracted however by an increased risk of bleeding [35, 36, 86, 87]. Whether the inhibition of some PAR1-induced beneficial effects on arteries, such as arterial vasodilation and t-PA secretion, can have adverse consequences in comparison with the potential beneficial antiplatelet effects is still unknown. For these reasons,
the use of PAR1 antagonists as anti-inflammatory drugs or in vascular diseases is still speculative.

The study by Gonzales in this issue of Vascular Pharmacology [2] deals with the important topic of identifying effective anti-thrombin drugs with minimal anticoagulant activity to be used in the context of ARDS/ALI [2]. The authors show that 2-O,3-O desulfated heparin (ODSH), a heparin-derived molecule with previously reported low anticoagulant activity, could attenuate thrombin-induced endothelial permeability in macro- and microvascular ECs, i.e. cultured human pulmonary artery ECs (HPAEC) and human lung microvascular ECs (HLMVEC). The effects of heparins and modified thrombins on endothelial permeability had been already reported. However, the effort of identifying a heparin molecule maintaining the desirable anti-inflammatory properties without anticoagulant risk is important. In this regard, the effects of ODSH are interesting and deserve attention in the future. However, the mechanisms by which heparin/ODSH exert their effects via PAR1 is not completely clear. The authors propose that a binding site for heparin/ODSH would be located at the ${}^{25}$RARR${}^{28}$ sequence of the N-terminal portion of PAR1 (Fig.1). Upon binding of heparin/ODSH to this sequence, these molecules would act as partial agonists of PAR1 and, due to proximity of this binding site to the cleavage site ${}^{41}$R/SFLLNR${}^{47}$, they would protect PAR1 itself from thrombin-mediated cleavage. However, direct heparin binding to PAR1 has never been reported before. We have previously reported that the hydrolysis by thrombin of a PAR1${}_{38-60}$ peptide, containing both the cleavage site and the hirudin-like domain of the receptor, was not inhibited by heparin in solution [88]. In fact, it is well established that the recognition domain anion binding exosite I of thrombin interacts with the hirudin-like domain of PAR1 to provide maximal cleavage efficiency. On the other hand, the other recognition domain anion binding exosite II of thrombin binds to heparin, with no effects on the cleavage of PAR1 in solution.

The PAR1${}_{38-60}$ peptide did not contain the ${}^{25}$RARR${}^{28}$ sequence. Therefore, the hypothesis that heparin/ODSH could inhibit thrombin cleavage of PAR1 by creating a steric hindrance close to its cleavage site will require confirmation. In

17
addition, in vivo experiments are needed to show whether ODSH administration has beneficial effect on thrombin-induced permeability in appropriate animal models.

Conclusive remarks

Since the initial discovery of PARs in 1991, great advances have been made on the function of these unique GPCRs in physiological and pathological conditions. The importance of PARs in the vasculature has been addressed in in vitro and in vivo studies. Effects on the endothelium-dependent regulation of vascular tone may be a major function of PARs under physiological conditions. Under pathological conditions, such as thrombus formation, hemorrhage and inflammation, activated proteases contribute, through PARs, to the conversion of ECs to a pro-inflammatory phenotype, which may contribute to the early phases of vascular lesion development. In addition, preclinical studies suggest that PAR1 regulates the differentiation, migration and proliferation of VSMCs, conditions favoring neointimal hyperplasia and vessel restenosis, atherosclerosis and hypertension. In addition to arterial thrombosis, PARs are an attractive target for chronic cardiovascular diseases and for acute endothelial dysfunction under inflammatory conditions. Given the beneficial role of PARs in the regulation of vascular tone, the impact of long-term effects of PAR1 antagonism in humans may be significant, but has to be better evaluated.

FIGURE LEGENDS

Figure 1: Mechanism of thrombin-induced cleavage of PAR1.
Thrombin cleaves PAR1 between residues Arg 41 and Ser 42 residues. The specificity of thrombin interaction with PAR1 is guaranteed by binding of its recognition domain anion exosite I to the hirudin-like domain of PAR1. After PAR1 cleavage, a new aminoterminal binds intramolecularly to the body of PAR1 itself to signal to G-proteins. The activation of PAR1 can be also induced by using the peptide mimetic SFLLRN-NH₂.

Figure 2: Structure of thrombin.
Crystal structure of human α-thrombin (1ppb of Protein Data Bank, 1.9 Angstrom resolution) [89]. A ribbon/stick diagram of thrombin is shown. Red sticks represent the residues of the anion binding exosite I, and blue sticks those of the anion binding exosite II. The active site cleft is between the two exosites with the PPACK molecule (yellow) inside. The anion binding exosite I and II are positive charged surface patches of the thrombin molecule that selectively bind several protein and non-protein ligands. The ligands for the exosites I and II are listed.

Figure 3: Effects of thrombin-mediated PAR1 activation in normal vessels.
Thrombin forming in the vasculature has pleiotropic effects on plasma proteins of the coagulation cascade, on platelets and on ECs. Effects on endothelial cells in normal vessels are mainly mediated by PAR1 (modified from Ref. 41).

Figure 4: Role of the endothelium in normal conditions and in sepsis:
A. In normal vessels the endothelium provides an anticoagulant and anti-inflammatory surface. A major mechanism is here the expression of thrombomodulin (TM) and endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR), which support thrombin in generating activated PC (APC). Thrombin bound to TM is the only

known physiological activator of Protein C. APC uses EPCR as a co-receptor for cleavage of PAR1 to exert its anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective effects on ECs.

B. When pathogens invade the bloodstream, systemic activation of inflammation leads to cytokine (IL-6, TNF-α) release and to endothelial activation and dysfunction. Coagulation is activated by the induction of TF on monocytes and on endothelial cells. Thrombin induces the release of von Willebrand factor, which recruits platelets for adhesion to the subendothelial surface and induces their aggregation. Thrombin activates PAR1, inducing pro-inflammatory responses and increases endothelial permeability. The ternary complex TF/FVIIa/FXa activates both PAR1 and PAR2, inducing pro-inflammatory responses. APC cleaves PAR1 in an EPCR-dependent manner and therefore modulates inflammation and apoptosis.
