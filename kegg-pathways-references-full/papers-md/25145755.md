Abstract | Following the discovery of Thelper 17 (T$_{\mathrm{H}}$17) cells, the past decade has witnessed a major revision of the T$_{\mathrm{H}}$ subset paradigm and substantial progress has been made in deciphering the molecular mechanisms of T cell lineage commitment and function. In this Review, we focus on the recent advances that have been made regarding the transcriptional control of T$_{\mathrm{H}}$17 cell plasticity and stability, as well as the effector functions of T$_{\mathrm{H}}$17 cells, and we highlight the mechanisms of IL-17 signalling in mesenchymal and barrier epithelial tissues. We also discuss the emerging clinical data showing that IL-17-specific and IL-23-specific antibody treatments are remarkably effective for treating many immune-mediated inflammatory diseases.

Crohn’s disease  
A type of inflammatory bowel disease that affects any part of the gastrointestinal tract from the mouth to the anus. Symptoms include abdominal pain, bloody diarrhoea, fever and weight loss. Other complications may occur outside the gastrointestinal tract and include anaemia, skin rashes, arthritis, inflammation of the eye and an increased risk of bowel cancer.

The discovery of interleukin-23 (IL-23) and the elucidation of the biology governed by this cytokine has led to important new insights within immunology$^{1-3}$. IL-23 has crucial roles in the pathogenesis of autoimmunity as it induces a cell population with a unique inflammatory gene signature that includes *Il17a* (which encodes IL-17A), *Il17f*, *Il6*, *Csf2* (which encodes colony-stimulating factor 2; also known as GM-CSF), *Tnf* (which encodes tumour necrosis factor (TNF)), *Ccl20* (which encodes CC-chemokine ligand 20 (CCL20)), *Ccl22*, *Il1rl1* (which encodes IL-1 receptor type 1 (IL-1R1)), and *Il23r* (which encodes IL-23 receptor (IL-23R))$^{4,5}$. On the basis of this distinct gene expression profile and unique Janus kinase (JAK)–signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway, a novel subset of T helper (T$_{\mathrm{H}}$) cells was discovered and designated ‘Th$_{\mathrm{IL}-17}$’ or ‘T$_{\mathrm{H}}$17’ (REFS 4,6,7). The discovery of the IL-23–T$_{\mathrm{H}}$17 pathway has led to fundamental changes in our understanding of cellular immunity (FIG. 1 (TIMELINE)). In 1989, Mossman and Coffman proposed to divide CD4$^{+}$ T$_{\mathrm{H}}$ cells into interferon-$\gamma$ (IFN$\gamma$)-producing T$_{\mathrm{H}}$1 cells (which are dependent on STAT1) and IL-4-producing T$_{\mathrm{H}}$2 cells (which are dependent on STAT6) to explain the tendency of T cells to diverge into mediators of either a cellular or humoral immune response, respectively$^{8,9}$. At that time, it was predicted that additional CD4$^{+}$ T cell subsets may exist that drive the full spectrum of immune responses. Indeed, the T$_{\mathrm{H}}$1–T$_{\mathrm{H}}$2 hypothesis does not adequately explain the regulation of STAT3-dependent CD4$^{+}$ T cells during autoimmunity and infection$^{3}$. In 2003, the recognition that IL-23 is indispensable for promoting autoimmunity led to a re-evaluation of the established paradigm$^{1,3,4,10,11}$.

In addition to T$_{\mathrm{H}}$17 cells, many innate immune cells respond to IL-23 and are also important in both resistance to infection and in mediating autoimmune pathology. These cells are characterized by expression of the transcription factor retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor-$\gamma$t (ROR$\gamma$t; which is encoded by *Rorc*)$^{12}$ and include subsets of $\gamma\delta$ T cells, natural killer T (NKT) cells, ‘natural’ T$_{\mathrm{H}}$17 cells and innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) — collectively, these subsets are termed ‘type 17’ cells$^{13-17}$ (BOX 1). These innate immune cells are located in non-lymphoid tissues where they are poised to respond immediately to tissue injury or pathogenic insults. Stimulation of T$_{\mathrm{H}}$17 cells and type 17 cells with IL-1$\beta$ and IL-23 induces local tissue inflammation, which is mainly mediated by type 17 signature cytokines such as IL-17, IL-22 and GM-CSF$^{4,18-20}$.

The exploration of type 17 immunity has led to the identification of previously unrecognized immune cell subsets and to the development of new paradigms stating that disease localization is dependent on the distribution of cell populations that express IL-23R and ROR$\gamma$t. These concepts are at the core of novel therapeutic strategies that aim to neutralize IL-17 or IL-23, which have shown encouraging results for the treatment of psoriasis, multiple sclerosis, Crohn’s disease and ankylosing spondylitis. In this Review, we highlight the roles of cytokines that promote the development and stabilization of T$_{\mathrm{H}}$17 cells via complex transcriptional networks. We discuss how the IL-17 signalling pathway is unique compared with that of other cytokine receptor families and we highlight recent studies that reveal the mechanisms by which IL-17 signalling is

### Cytokines that promote T<sub>H</sub>17 cell development

RORγt<sup>+</sup> T<sub>H</sub>17 cells can be broadly divided into two groups: first, host protective cells that express both IL-17 and IL-10 (REFS 21–23) and, second, a highly inflammatory population that expresses IL-17, IL-22, IFNγ and GM-CSF<sup>4,18</sup>. The ultimate outcome of T<sub>H</sub>17 cell activity is determined by the balance of these effector functions. T<sub>H</sub>17 cells activated by transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) and IL-6 promote mucosal defence and barrier tissue integrity, and curtail immunopathogenic responses<sup>21–23</sup>, whereas IL-23-activated T<sub>H</sub>17 cells promote chronic tissue inflammation during infection, granuloma formation and autoimmunity<sup>24–26</sup>.

### Initiating cytokines

Studies in 2003 and 2005 showed that IL-23 promotes the development and expansion of a pathogenic T cell population that has a unique inflammatory gene signature<sup>1,4,6,7</sup>. However, IL-23 alone cannot drive the differentiation of T<sub>H</sub>17 cells from naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell precursors<sup>4,27</sup>, indicating that additional factors are required for their lineage fate determination. Shortly thereafter, the laboratories of Stockinger, Weaver and Kuchroo simultaneously showed that the addition of TGFβ and IL-6 during initial T cell recognition of cognate antigen promotes T<sub>H</sub>17 cell differentiation<sup>27–29</sup>. IL-6 has an essential role in this process by activating STAT3 (REF. 30), which directly drives the transcription of T<sub>H</sub>17 lineage-specific genes, including *Rorc*, *Il17* and *Il23r*<sup>31</sup>. STAT3 also suppresses TGFβ-induced forkhead box P3 (FOX3) expression, and thereby inhibits the generation of regulatory T (*T<sub>Reg</sub>*) cells<sup>27</sup>. Consequently, *Il6<sup>-/-</sup>* mice are unable to generate T<sub>H</sub>17 cells and they are protected from developing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE)<sup>32</sup> and collagen-induced arthritis (CIA)<sup>33</sup>. Although IL-6 was identified as a therapeutic target long before the discovery of T<sub>H</sub>17 cells, recent advances have validated IL-6 as a target for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory conditions. Whereas IL-6 and TGFβ regulate the initial lineage specification of T<sub>H</sub>17 cells, IL-21 is an important autocrine growth factor. IL-21 is produced by a number of NK cell and T cell subsets, and is a homologue of IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9 and IL-15 that signals via a receptor complex composed of a unique IL-21R chain and the shared common γ-chain (also known as γc and IL-2Rγ). It is interesting that this JAK–STAT activating cytokine can replace IL-2 as an autocrine growth factor for the expansion of T<sub>H</sub>17 cells<sup>34–36</sup>.

IL-1β signalling also has a crucial role during the initial stages of T<sub>H</sub>17 cell differentiation. *Il1r1<sup>-/-</sup>* mice fail to develop antigen-specific T<sub>H</sub>17 cells and are resistant to EAE<sup>37</sup>. The expression of IL-1R1 by T<sub>H</sub>17 cells is induced by IL-6, and signalling through the IL-1R promotes the transcription factor interferon-regulatory factor 4 (IRF4), which reinforces the expression of RORγt<sup>38</sup>. Mechanistically, IL-1β induces phosphorylation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and thereby enhances the metabolic fitness of rapidly dividing T<sub>H</sub>17 cells during inflammation. Indeed, rapamycin treatment or mTOR deficiency completely abolishes IL-1β-induced T<sub>H</sub>17 cell proliferation<sup>39</sup>. These results suggest that IL-6 directs the differentiation of T<sub>H</sub>17 cells, whereas IL-1β enhances the expansion of these cells when they are in competition with other T cell subsets in the context of a resource-limited tissue environment.

In contrast to IL-1β and IL-6, the role of TGFβ in T<sub>H</sub>17 cell differentiation is more complex. Genetic approaches such as the expression of a dominant-negative TGFβ receptor II (which inhibits the formation of a functional TGFβ signalling complex) and a T cell-specific deletion of the gene encoding TGFβ have confirmed that endogenous TGFβ induces T<sub>H</sub>17 cell development *in vivo*<sup>40–42</sup>. However, deletion of the gene encoding TGFβ also led to the excessive production of

Box 1 | Type 17 immune cells

Type 17 cells ubiquitously express retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor-γt (RORγt) and interleukin-23 receptor (IL-23R), and they develop in the thymus, with the exception of group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), which develop in the bone marrow. Adaptive CD4+ IL-17-producing cells require IL-6 signalling during initial activation of the T cell receptor (TCR), whereas all other subsets respond to IL-1β and IL-23 signalling upon emigration from the thymus and do not require IL-6. These ‘innate’ immune cells are poised to produce IL-17 upon sensing inflammatory cytokines, as well as in response to stress and injury signals. Whereas the adaptive T<sub>H</sub>17 cells primarily reside in secondary lymphoid organs, the innate type 17 cells are situated in a broad range of peripheral tissues where they directly survey the interface between the host and the environment.

IFNγ and IL-4, which inhibited T<sub>H</sub>17 cell development and population expansion<sup>40,41</sup>. Thus, TGFβ can either function as a direct T<sub>H</sub>17 cell-inducing factor or could indirectly suppress alternative cell fates. Notably, in the absence of TGFβ, IL-6 alone can promote the development of T<sub>H</sub>17 cells from T cells that lack the transcription factors T-bet (which is encoded by *Tbx21*) and STAT6 (REF. 43), which suggests that TGFβ suppresses T<sub>H</sub>17 cell differentiation indirectly by repressing T-bet and GATA-binding protein 3 (GATA3). This complexity is further highlighted by human studies, as three separate research groups have shown that TGFβ is required for *in vitro* T<sub>H</sub>17 cell development, whereas two other groups found that a cocktail of IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-23 is sufficient to drive T<sub>H</sub>17 cell differentiation<sup>44–48</sup>. These discrepancies could be owing to the different sources of the human T cells that were used in these studies (for example, peripheral blood versus umbilical cord blood), which may influence their developmental status and, hence, the requirement for TGFβ. However, under *in vivo* inflammatory conditions, the presence of TGFβ is probably necessary for optimal T<sub>H</sub>17 cell differentiation.

Although the combination of TGFβ and IL-6 efficiently generates T<sub>H</sub>17 cells *in vitro*, the cells generated by this cocktail are only weakly pathogenic and subsequent exposure to IL-23 is essential to drive pathogenicity<sup>21,49–53</sup>. A recent study has further supported the notion that TGFβ is not always required for *in vitro* T<sub>H</sub>17 cell differentiation, as T<sub>H</sub>17 cells could be generated in response to IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-23 in a TGFβ-independent manner<sup>53</sup>. Interestingly, these TGFβ-independent IL-23<sup>+</sup>RORγt<sup>+</sup> T<sub>H</sub>17 cells are also T-bet<sup>+</sup>, and they co-express IFNγ and GM-CSF<sup>4,19,20,53</sup>. Such ‘hybrid’ T cells with diverse functional plasticity (see below) are frequently detected in lesions from patients with multiple sclerosis and mice with EAE<sup>54,55</sup>.

The studies mentioned above specifically examined TGFβ1. In a recent report, it was proposed that TGFβ3 promotes the development of pathogenic T<sub>H</sub>17 cells by upregulating IL-23R expression<sup>56</sup>. Interestingly, TGFβ3 was induced by IL-23 and acted in a feedforward loop to enhance IL-23R expression, thereby amplifying IL-23 signalling<sup>56</sup>. Taken together, these studies indicate that isoforms of TGFβ, together with IL-6, can drive the development of IL-17- and IL-10-producing cells that are important for mucosal defence; however, subsequent exposure to IL-23 is required for the development of pathogenic T<sub>H</sub>17 cells.

Differentiating and stabilizing cytokines. TGFβ- and IL-6-driven T<sub>H</sub>17 cells have limited inherent pathogenicity, and exposure to IL-23 is essential for the maturation of inflammatory T<sub>H</sub>17 cells<sup>1,4</sup>. This is supported by genetic studies that link *IL23R* polymorphisms with susceptibility to autoimmune diseases such as psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, multiple

sclerosis and Crohn’s disease^{57–61}. Accumulating data clearly indicate that IL-23 promotes the pathogenicity of mature T~H~17 cells by several mechanisms, including through the maintenance of T~H~17 signature gene expression (Rorc and Il17); the induction of effector genes (Il22, Csf2 and Ifng); the downregulation of repressive factors (Il2, Il27 and Il12); and the amplification of its own signalling by upregulating Il23r expression.

By using an approach that restricts IL-23R deficiency to T cells, we have shown that in the absence of IL-23 signalling, T~H~17 cells are arrested at an early activation stage and are unable to mediate encephalitogenicity in EAE^51^. Subsequent studies have revealed that IL-23R is needed for co-expression of GM-CSF, as GM-CSF-deficient mice are resistant to EAE and GM-CSF-deficient T~H~17 cells cannot transfer EAE to naive recipients^19,20^. IL-23 also induces IFNγ expression in T~H~17 cells, and the pathogenicity of IFNγ^+^IL-17^+^ cells was demonstrated by the transfer of an IL-23R^+^ memory-activated T cell population (co-expressing T-bet, IFNγ, RORγt and IL-17) that promoted severe EAE^52,55,62^. To gain inflammatory function, T~H~17 cells must overcome the effects of inhibitory cytokines such as IL-27 and IL-2 (REFS 63,64). Indeed, committed IL-23R^+^ T~H~17 cells are highly resistant to IL-27- and IL-2-mediated suppression^65^. This phenomenon could be owing to the downregulation of IL-27R in mature T~H~17 cells^63,65^. Pathogenic T~H~17 cells induced by IL-23 in the absence of TGFβ also express reduced levels of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), C-MAF (also known as MAF) and IL-10 compared with TGFβ-driven T~H~17 cells^56,62^. AHR and C-MAF are induced under TGFβ- and IL-6-driven T~H~17 differentiation conditions, and they transactivate Il10 expression^66–68^. However, it is unclear whether IL-23 directly suppresses these factors to drive pathogenicity. The upregulation of IL-23R expression is important for IL-23 to drive the differentiation and stabilization of pathogenic T~H~17 cells, which depends on STAT3 (REFS 10,62). Taken together, these studies establish that TGFβ, IL-6 and IL-1β are essential elements that initiate T~H~17 cell development, whereas IL-23 serves as a pivotal factor that drives both the differentiation and inflammatory functions of pathogenic T~H~17 cells.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP–seq). A technique used to analyse the interactions between transcription factors and their target DNA. ChIP–seq combines chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) with massively parallel DNA sequencing to identify the specific sequences bound by regulatory proteins.

Hyper-IgE syndrome An inherited immune deficiency that is usually caused by mutations in signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and is associated with reduced T helper 17 (T~H~17) cell frequency. The disease is characterized by elevated levels of serum IgE, eosinophilia, ‘cold’ staphylococcal abscesses, eczema, pulmonary infections and chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis.

STAT3 directly regulates the T~H~17-type cytokine and cytokine receptor genes (such as Il17, Il17f and Il23r), and that it also controls expression of the T~H~17 cell-specific transcription factors Rorc, Batf and Irf4 (REF. 31). In addition, STAT3 binds both the promoter regions of Il17a and Il17f, and their intergenic regions, which contain enhancer elements that undergo histone modifications during differentiation^31^. These findings are also relevant to humans, as patients with STAT3 mutations suffer from autosomal dominant hyper-IgE syndrome (AD-HIES; also known as Job’s syndrome) and are susceptible to recurrent pulmonary infections and chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis (CMC) owing to a reduced frequency of IL-17-producing T cells^69,70^ (see below).

BATF is a member of the activator protein 1 (AP-1) family of transcription factors, which is upregulated in T~H~ cells following T cell receptor (TCR) activation^71,72^. In 2009, a study showed that BATF is essential for T~H~17 cell differentiation and that mice lacking BATF are resistant to EAE^72^. Batf^−/−^ mice have normal TGFβ and IL-6 signalling, and can upregulate RORγt early on during T cell development, but they fail to maintain RORγt expression^72^. However, the overexpression of RORγt could only partially rescue the T~H~17 cell defects observed in Batf^−/−^ cells, and the expression of both BATF and RORγt is required to drive IL-17 expression, which suggests that BATF and RORγt cooperatively control T~H~17 cell differentiation. Furthermore, BATF forms a dimer with JUNB that directly binds to the promoters of Il17, Il21 and Il22 in T~H~17 cells^72^. IRF4 was originally reported to be essential for T~H~2 cell differentiation^73^ and has now also been implicated in T~H~17 cell differentiation^74^. IRF4-deficient mice are protected from EAE and exhibit a defect in T~H~17 cell differentiation that stems from impaired RORγt expression^74^. However, similarly to BATF, the overexpression of RORγt in Irf4^−/−^ T cells could only partially restore IL-17 production, which indicates that both RORγt and IRF4 are required to establish the T~H~17 lineage.

Two recent studies show that BATF and IRF4 are ‘pioneer factors’ that cooperatively bind and govern the accessibility of chromatin, which enables RORγt recruitment and binding to T~H~17 signature genes^75,76^. A comprehensive ChIP–seq analysis revealed a striking overlap between BATF and IRF4 promoter occupancy in T~H~17 cells^76^. Furthermore, these transcription factors form a complex and regulate the DNA-binding activities of each other. As the binding of BATF and IRF4 promotes strong association and co-occupancy by T~H~17 cell-defining transcription factors (STAT3 and RORγt), BATF and IRF4 seem to serve as the initiating factors that regulate chromatin accessibility in T~H~17 cells. Surprisingly, co-occupancy by these transcription factors was also observed in TCR-activated but non-polarized T~H~0 cells. Thus, BATF and IRF4 are bona fide pioneer factors that remodel chromatin to enable access of lineage-specifying transcription factors induced by certain environmental signals.

The transcription of a gene is regulated by sequence-specific binding of proteins to the promoter region and to distant regulatory enhancer sites. Enhancer activity is modified by histone-modifying enzymes — such as the

Transcriptional control of T~H~17 cells The knowledge of transcriptional control of T~H~17 differentiation is mainly based on studies of non-pathogenic T~H~17 cells. CD4^+^ T~H~ cell populations are considered as unique lineages on the basis of their characteristic expression of transcriptional regulators and signature cytokines. RORγt serves as the master regulator for T~H~17 cells, and Rorc^−/−^ mice lack T~H~17 cells and exhibit reduced autoimmune disease severity^12^. By contrast, enhanced expression of RORγt in naive CD4^+^ T cells induces key genes that are essential for T~H~17 cell differentiation^12^. RORγt cooperates with a network of transcription factors — most notably, STAT3, IRF4 and basic leucine zipper transcription factor ATF-like (BATF) — to initiate the complete differentiation programme. The activation of STAT3 by IL-6 and IL-23 is a key event in T~H~17 lineage specification. Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP–seq) analysis has demonstrated that

alternate lineage fates, by exploiting the altered enhancer landscape that is initially created by BATF and IRF4 (induced by TCR signalling), and STAT3 (induced by cytokines)⁷⁶ (FIG. 2). These new insights argue against the notion that a single factor governs lineage specificity, and instead indicate that a transcription factor complex regulates fate commitment⁷⁷. Furthermore, these results are consistent with studies that have identified other transcriptional regulators — such as T-bet (for T<sub>H</sub>1 cells) and FOXP3 (for T<sub>Reg</sub> cells) — as factors that take advantage of an enhancer landscape that is already established by STAT proteins⁷⁸,⁷⁹.

Another key transcription factor in T<sub>H</sub>17 cell fate determination is hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1α), which is a key sensor of hypoxia (FIG. 2). HIF1α is induced upon TCR activation, and its expression is further enhanced by the hypoxic conditions associated with tissue inflammation, as well as by IL-6- and STAT3-dependent differentiation signals⁸⁰. Mechanistically, HIF1α directly binds and drives transcription of *Rorc*, and forms a complex with RORγt and p300 to drive *Il17* expression⁸⁰. HIF1α can also form a complex with FOXP3 and targets it for proteasomal degradation⁸⁰. In this way, pro-inflammatory environmental cues, such as hypoxia, stabilize the T<sub>H</sub>17 lineage. Two recent studies further demonstrate that a pro-inflammatory environment can also simultaneously destabilize the T<sub>Reg</sub> cell lineage through the regulation of FOXP3 at the post-translational level by enhanced recruitment of an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase STUB1 (also known as CHIP) that mediates FOXP3 ubiquitylation or by decreased expression of deubiquitylase ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase 7 (USP7)⁸¹,⁸².

Despite advances in deciphering the T<sub>H</sub>17 transcriptional network, we still lack a clear understanding of IL-23-dependent mechanisms that coordinate the differentiation of pathogenic T<sub>H</sub>17 cells. STAT3 activation alone cannot explain the unique requirement for IL-23 in pathogenic T<sub>H</sub>17 cell commitment, as IL-6 is an even more potent activator of STAT3. Additional IL-23-induced transcriptional regulators or signalling pathways must operate to promote inflammatory T<sub>H</sub>17 cell effector function. Furthermore, it will be important to assess the T<sub>H</sub>17 cell enhancer landscape that is created by IL-6 compared with IL-23 to determine whether divergence at an epigenetic level influences functional outcomes.

T<sub>H</sub>17 cell plasticity versus stability

T<sub>H</sub>17 cell plasticity refers to the ability of T<sub>H</sub>17 cells to acquire divergent functional capabilities while maintaining the fundamental T<sub>H</sub>17 programme that is defined by the expression of RORγt and IL-17. Recently published data indicate that T<sub>H</sub>17 cells retain a high degree of plasticity that enables them to co-express alternative lineage-specifying transcription factors and effector cytokines²³,⁵³,⁵⁵,⁵⁶,⁸³. Such functional heterogeneity endows T<sub>H</sub>17 cells with an enhanced ability to traffic to a broad range of anatomical sites and to efficiently promote diverse functions, including host defence, barrier tissue integrity and wound-healing responses.

REVIEWS

Defining the factors that regulate T<sub>H</sub>17 cell plasticity is an area of intensive investigation. Although RORγt is essential for the development of T<sub>H</sub>17 cells, it is not sufficient to promote all functional capabilities. As mentioned above, IL-23 might be a pivotal factor dictating the functional diversity of T<sub>H</sub>17 cells through the induction of alternate lineage-specific transcription factors (such as *Tbx21*) and effector genes (such as *Il22*, *Csf2* and *Ifng*), while still maintaining the core T<sub>H</sub>17 programme (which entails expression of *Rorc* and *Il17*)<sup>4,25</sup>. We have recently shown that the transcription factor B lymphocyte-induced maturation protein 1 (BLIMP1; which is encoded by *Prdm1*) is induced by IL-23 and acts both as a gene activator and repressor to induce T<sub>H</sub>17 cell maturation (R.J. and D.J.C., unpublished observations). BLIMP1 coordinates with RORγt to enhance the expression of *Il23r* and *Csf2*, while simultaneously repressing *Il2* and alternate fate-determining factors (such as *Bcl2*, *Foxp3* and *Gata3*). Interestingly, BLIMP1 directly engages with the *Il23r*, *Il17f* and *Csf2* loci in close proximity to RORγt, p300 and STAT3, which suggests that BLIMP1 is part of a complex that regulates the pathogenic function of T<sub>H</sub>17 cells (R.J. and D.J.C., unpublished observations).

T<sub>H</sub>17 cell plasticity could be explained by epigenetic modifications. Recent advances in the genome-wide analysis of histone modifications enables examination of the permissive and repressive histone marks, H3K4 tri-methylation (H3K4me3) and H3K27me3, respectively, on lineage-specifying genes. Interestingly, T<sub>H</sub>17 cells display both active and repressive histone marks on *Tbx21* and *Gata3*, whereas T<sub>H</sub>1 and T<sub>H</sub>2 cells show only repressive marks on the *Rorc* and *Il17* loci<sup>84</sup>. In other words, T<sub>H</sub>17 cells seem to be highly poised to acquire other T<sub>H</sub> cell functions under appropriate environmental stimuli<sup>84</sup>. Interestingly, T<sub>Reg</sub> cells are the only other cell type with such dual modifications at the gene loci encoding T<sub>H</sub> cell master transcription factors, which gives them the advantage of functional diversity and plasticity.

The extent to which the T<sub>H</sub>17 cell phenotype shows stability is more than a question of functional malleability. Stability is defined by whether RORγt-expressing T<sub>H</sub>17 cells can lose their core transcriptional and functional characteristics and become RORγt<sup>-</sup> “ex-T<sub>H</sub>17” cells<sup>55</sup>. The concept of T<sub>H</sub>17 stability has been explored in studies using both *in vitro* and *in vivo* approaches. The *in vitro* polarization approach, in which the inducing signals are constantly present, has been unable to demonstrate that T<sub>H</sub>17 cells are unstable<sup>85</sup>. However, *in vivo* systems such as mouse strains expressing Cre recombinase under the control of the *Il17a* promoter have greatly enhanced our understanding of this important issue<sup>22,55,85</sup>. Crossing the *Il17a<sup>Cre</sup>* mice with Rosa26-enhanced yellow fluorescence protein (YFP)-reporter mice generated a fate-mapping system in which *Il17a*-expressing cells are permanently marked with YFP. This cell-tagging system has demonstrated that bona fide T<sub>H</sub>17 cells can be destabilized and converted into T<sub>H</sub>1 cells when exposed to appropriate environmental stimuli<sup>55</sup>. Histone modification analysis of IL-17<sup>+</sup> cells isolated using cytokine capture beads from the inflamed intestine has confirmed these results<sup>86</sup>. However, epigenomic analysis of ex-T<sub>H</sub>17 cells at a single-cell level is required to gain a deeper molecular understanding of T<sub>H</sub>17 cell stability and to avoid any variations caused by heterogeneity within the cell population. For example, it would be revealing to analyse epigenetic changes in T<sub>H</sub>17 cells that acquire T<sub>H</sub>1-type functions. Do they undergo complete epigenetic remodelling of T<sub>H</sub>17 cell-associated genes or do they retain epigenetic evidence of their T<sub>H</sub>17 cell origins? Are former T<sub>H</sub>17 cells capable of reacquiring the original T<sub>H</sub>17 cell programme upon TCR stimulation because they retain a core epigenetic status? Understanding the plasticity of T<sub>H</sub>17 cells at the epigenetic level may have important advantages. First, it could enable us to predict the developmental stages at which T<sub>H</sub>17 cells would be susceptible to reprogramming towards the T<sub>Reg</sub> cell phenotype. This cellular reprogramming could have added anti-inflammatory benefits, in addition to depleting T<sub>H</sub>17 cells. Second, it is vital to understand the durability of the T<sub>H</sub>17 effector cell suppression and/or reprogramming. It is crucial to determine whether ex-T<sub>H</sub>17 cells can revert back to their original pathogenic phenotype after reprogramming in patients.

### IL-17 signal transduction

As outlined above, much effort has been devoted to defining the cellular sources of IL-17 and understanding the subsequent regulation of its expression. This section describes the current understanding of the IL-17-induced signalling pathways that link receptor ligation to the downstream biological effects of this cytokine. Cells that respond to IL-17 are mainly, though not exclusively, non-haematopoietic, and the effects of IL-17 are most similar to other innate inflammatory effectors, especially those that belong to the IL-1 family of cytokines and Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands<sup>87</sup>. In particular, IL-17 is a potent regulator of neutrophils and this effect is mediated by IL-17-induced genes such as those that encode granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF; also known as CSF3) and the CXC chemokines<sup>88</sup>. The IL-17R has many unique and unexpected properties in terms of its structure and signalling, and a detailed understanding of these events may reveal novel drug targets or potential avenues for therapeutic intervention.

#### Activation of IL-17R signalling

When IL-17R (now known as IL-17RA) was cloned in 1995, it was noteworthy for its striking lack of similarity to known receptor families<sup>89</sup>. Subsequently, it became clear that IL-17RA was the founding member of a new subclass of cytokine receptors, which comprises five receptor subunits — IL-17RA–IL-17RE — that have homology to one another but not to other receptor families<sup>87</sup> (FIG. 3). All subunits of the IL-17R family have a broad expression pattern, with IL-17RA being most highly expressed in haematopoietic cell types and IL-17RC in non-haematopoietic cells<sup>90</sup>. Most of the homology within the IL-17R family is found in the conserved cytoplasmic SEF/IL-17R (SEFIR) motif, which

These alternative pathways are regulated by ACT1 phosphorylation, which is mediated by inducible IkB kinase (IKKi; also known as IkBKε) and serine/threonine-protein kinase TBK1 (REFS 101,102) (FIG. 4). ACT1 function and stability is in turn regulated by the chaperone heat shock protein 90 (HSP90). The inhibition of HSP90 results in proteasomal degradation of ACT1, which suppresses IL-17 signalling<sup>103</sup>. ACT1 seems to be required for most, if not all, IL-17-dependent signalling events<sup>104</sup> and the majority of phenotypes seen in *Actl*<sup>-/-</sup> mice are similar to *Il17ra*<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Notably, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in *ACT1* has been associated with psoriasis<sup>105</sup>. Thus, for the IL-17 family, all known signalling pathways emanate from ACT1, which leads to an activation of pro-inflammatory signalling cascades.

IL-17 mainly induces signalling in cells of non-haematopoietic origin, including epithelial and mesenchymal cell types. The genes that are induced by IL-17 largely explain its pro-inflammatory activities — for example, IL-17 induces the expression of chemokines such as CXC-chemokine ligand 1 (CXCL1), CXCL2 and CXCL5, which promote neutrophil chemotaxis<sup>106</sup>. IL-17 also induces the expression of CCL20, which promotes the trafficking of mucosa-associated cells that express CC-chemokine receptor 6 (CCR6) — notably, CCR6 is a characteristic receptor on IL-17-expressing cells such as T<sub>H</sub>17 cells and ILC3s<sup>107</sup>. Other cytokines induced by IL-17, such as IL-6 and G-CSF, regulate myeloid cell lineages and especially neutrophils. Additionally, IL-17 is a strong inducer of antimicrobial peptides, particularly β-defensins, which can prevent infection at mucosal surfaces and in the skin, and that may also exert chemotactic activity<sup>108</sup>. Lipocalin 2 (LCN2; also known as 24p3) is another IL-17-induced antimicrobial protein that controls bacterial growth by restricting access to dietary iron<sup>109</sup>.

The CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) family of transcription factors is also activated by IL-17 signal transduction, and is often just as important as NF-κB in the regulation of target genes. For example, the *Il6* and *Lcn2* promoters require both NF-κB and C/EBP elements, as deletion of either element renders their promoters insensitive to IL-17-mediated signals<sup>110,111</sup>. IL-17 induces the expression of C/EBPδ at the mRNA and protein level and, to a lesser extent, that of C/EBPβ<sup>110,112</sup>. The latter is regulated extensively by post-transcriptional and post-translational modifications, including alternative translation and phosphorylation<sup>113</sup>. The phosphorylation of C/EBPβ depends on a glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β)- and ERK-dependent pathway, which dampens IL-17-dependent signalling (see below)<sup>114</sup>.

On their own, IL-17A (and IL-17F) are modest activators of signalling, but they function cooperatively with other pro-inflammatory molecules, particularly TNF, but also IFNγ, IL-22, lymphotoxin, IL-1β and lipopolysaccharide<sup>88</sup>. The molecular basis for this synergy is not completely understood and probably involves multiple mechanisms. In synovial tissue, IL-17 upregulates TNFR2 expression, and thereby enhances responsiveness to TNF<sup>115</sup>. For some genes, cooperativity between IL-17 and TNF occurs at the level of the

Figure 3 | **IL-17 ligand and receptor family members.** Interleukin-17 receptor A (IL-17RA) has been shown to serve as a common receptor chain for all IL-17 ligand members except for IL-17B. Whereas IL-17A and IL-17F are T helper 17 (T<sub>H</sub>17) cell signature genes, IL-17E (also known as IL-25) is a T<sub>H</sub>2-type cytokine that is involved in anti-helminth immunity and allergic responses. IL-17C is an autocrine factor that is primarily produced by and activates signalling in skin and gut epithelial cells. Currently, there is limited knowledge of IL-17B and IL-17D biology.

suggests a common mode of signalling that is probably distinct from other cytokine receptors. A landmark bioinformatic study demonstrated that this domain is related to the Toll/IL-1R (TIR) domain<sup>91</sup>. Recent studies have revealed that the IL-17RA subunit is shared by the receptors for several members of the IL-17 cytokine family (FIG. 3). IL-17RA is essential for IL-17E (also known as IL-25) signalling when partnered with IL-17RB, and for IL-17C signalling when partnered with IL-17RE<sup>92,93</sup>. The only other identified protein that has been shown to have a SEFIR domain is the adaptor protein ACT1 (also known as CIKS)<sup>91</sup>; indeed, ACT1 is essential for signal transduction by all of the known IL-17R family members<sup>87,94,95</sup>.

Despite the similarity between the SEFIR domain of the IL-17R and the TIR domains of TLRs and IL-1R, studies of IL-17 have shown that these receptors operate differently. For example, ACT1 only positively regulates signalling by the IL-17R family and it is not involved in any other cytokine signalling pathways<sup>96</sup>. ACT1 serves both as a signalling adaptor — to recruit TNFR-associated factor (TRAF) proteins and direct the activation of several downstream signalling cascades<sup>94</sup> — and as an E3 ligase to mediate the ubiquitylation of TRAF6 (REF. 97). The recruitment and ubiquitylation of TRAF6 leads to activation of the canonical nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathway and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, which include extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), p38 and JUN N-terminal kinase (JNK). Consequently, the activation of these pathways by IL-17 is impaired in the absence of either ACT1 or TRAF6 (REFS 94,95,98). Alternatively, ACT1 can recruit TRAF2 and TRAF5, which promote the activation of an mRNA stability pathway by sequestering ASF/SF2 (also known as SRSF1) and recruiting the stabilizing factor HuR (also known as ELAVL1)<sup>99,100</sup>.

Figure 4 | IL-17 receptor signal transduction. Interleukin-17 (IL-17)  
signalling is activated upon binding of IL-17 to a dimeric receptor  
complex that is composed of IL-17 receptor A (IL-17RA) and IL-17RC.  
Positive regulators of signalling are shown in blue and green. Tumour  
necrosis factor receptor-associated factors (TRAFs) are shown in  
orange, and they have both positive and negative regulatory effects.  
Structure–function analyses of both IL-17RA and IL-17RC has  
demonstrated that the conserved SEF/IL-17R (SEFIR) domain, as well  
as non-conserved downstream residues (known as the ‘SEFIR extension’  
(SEFEX) domain), are essential for the activation of signalling. Both  
IL-17R subunits recruit the adaptor protein ACT1, which serves as an  
adaptor and an E3 ubiquitin ligase. ACT1 mediates the K63-linked  
ubiquitylation of TRAF6, which results in the downstream activation of  
TAK1, the inhibitor of nuclear factor (NF)-κB (IKK) complex and  
canonical NF-κB. IL-17 also activates components of mitogen-activated  
protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, including JUN N-terminal kinase (JNK),  
p38 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). In addition, IL-17  
signalling induces the phosphorylation of the CCAAT/enhancer-binding  
protein-β (C/EBPβ) transcription factor by ERK- and glycogen synthase  
kinase 3β (GSK3β)-mediated pathways. In an alternative signalling  
pathway, ACT1 is phosphorylated by inducible IκB kinase (IKKi; also  
known as IκBKε) and serine/threonine-protein kinase TBK1.  
Phosphorylated ACT1, together with TRAF2 and TRAF5, sequesters the  
RNA-binding protein ASF/SF2 and recruits HuR to stabilize target  
mRNA transcripts. The chaperone heat shock protein 90 (HSP90)  
controls stability of ACT1, promoting signal transduction. Negative  
regulators of signalling are shown in red. The deubiquitylating enzyme  
A20 is induced by IL-17 and mediates negative feedback by targeting  
TRAF6 to negatively regulate NF-κB and MAPK signalling. Similarly,  
ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase 25 (USP25) targets both TRAF5 and  
TRAF6 to inhibit IL-17-mediated signalling. The microRNA miR-23b also  
acts as an inhibitor of IL-17 signalling by targeting TGFβ-activated  
kinase 2 (TAB2), TAB3 and IKKa. The E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complex  
βTrCP facilitates proteasomal degradation of ACT1 via K48-linked  
ubiquitylation. TRAF3 and TRAF4 inhibit IL-17 by competing with ACT1  
for binding to IL-17RA and TRAF6, respectively. The distal C/EBPβ  
activation domain (CBAD) of IL-17RA coordinates the inhibition of IL-17  
signalling by several mechanisms. GSK3β-mediated inhibitory  
phosphorylation of C/EBPβ is dependent on the CBAD. The inhibitors  
A20, TRAF3 and anaphase-promoting complex subunit 5 (ANAPC5) also  
associate with IL-17RA through the CBAD. AP-1, activator protein 1;

promoter (for example, *Il6* and *Lcn2*) and/or mRNA stability (for example, mRNA encoding chemokines such as CXCL1)¹¹⁶. IL-17 also upregulates the expression of NF-κB inhibitor-ζ (IκBζ) — which, despite its name, has both positive and negative regulatory effects on the NF-κB family — that in turn promotes the expression of at least some target genes¹¹⁷. The ability of IL-17 to signal cooperatively with other cytokines is probably an important aspect of its biology, as inflammatory environments contain multiple cytokines that can act in concert.

**Negative regulation of IL-17 signalling.** Dysregulated IL-17 production and signalling is associated with the development of several autoimmune diseases and, thus, it is not surprising that IL-17-mediated inflammatory signalling is regulated at multiple levels. As outlined below, a variety of inhibitory mechanisms that restrict signal transduction have been identified (FIG. 4).

Deubiquitylating enzymes (DUBs) can reduce IL-17-mediated signal transduction by targeting TRAFs — for example, ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase 25 (USP25) removes K63-linked ubiquitin chains on both TRAF5 and TRAF6, which inhibits the transcription of IL-17 target genes, as well as IL-17-induced mRNA stability⁹⁹. USP25 deficiency is associated with enhanced IL-17-dependent pulmonary inflammation and an increased susceptibility to EAE¹¹⁸.

We recently identified A20 (which is encoded by *TNFAIP3*) as a vital feedback inhibitor of IL-17 signalling¹¹⁹. SNPs in *TNFAIP3* are associated with numerous autoimmune and lymphoproliferative diseases, including psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis and certain B cell malignancies¹²⁰. IL-17 induces the expression of *Tnfaip3* mRNA and increases A20 protein levels, which triggers the deubiquitylation of TRAF6 and downregulates the activation of NF-κB and MAPK (particularly JNK)¹¹⁹. Notably, A20 directly associates with IL-17RA through the C-terminal C/EBPβ activation domain (CBAD) of the receptor¹¹⁹. The CBAD is also an interaction site for TRAF3, which is another negative regulator of IL-17 signalling¹²¹, and several years ago, a structure–function analysis of IL-17RA showed that deletion of the CBAD enhances IL-17 signalling¹²². Intriguingly, A20 seems to inhibit IL-17 in a non-canonical manner. In other systems, A20 needs to interact with accessory factors — such as TAX1-binding protein 1 (TAX1BP1) and E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase ITCH — in order to hydrolyse K63-linked substrates efficiently¹²³, and deletion of the gene encoding TAX1BP1 or ITCH results in a phenotype that is similar to (albeit less severe than) that caused by the lack of A20 (REFS 124,125). However, knockdown of either TAX1BP1 or ITCH does not inhibit IL-17 signalling, which suggests that A20 might use alternative adaptors¹²⁷. Indeed, we found that A20 associates with anaphase-promoting complex subunit 5 (ANAPC5)¹²⁶,¹²⁸, which is best known as a subunit of a multiprotein E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that regulates cell cycle progression. Together, these data show that the reversal of K63 ubiquitylation on TRAF6 via A20 is an important downregulatory strategy for restricting IL-17-mediated inflammation.

microRNAs  
Single-stranded RNA molecules of approximately 21–23 nucleotides in length that regulate gene expression.

K48-linked ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation of adaptor proteins is another means of regulating inflammatory signalling. IL-17R signalling is inhibited by the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complex βTrCP, which induces the K48 ubiquitylation of phosphorylated forms of ACT1 that in turn leads to its proteasomal degradation¹²⁸. TRAF proteins also have negative roles in regulating IL-17-induced inflammatory signalling pathways¹²⁹. For example, TRAF3 associates with IL-17RA through a consensus TRAF binding site in the CBAD of the receptor, thereby competing with ACT1 for binding to IL-17RA and dampening IL-17-dependent signalling¹²¹. Similarly, TRAF4 directly binds ACT1 upon IL-17 stimulation and competes for its association with TRAF6. Consistent with this, TRAF3 and TRAF4 limit IL-17-mediated development of EAE¹²¹,¹³⁰.

Some data implicate microRNAs (miRNAs) in regulating both T<sub>H</sub>17 cell development and IL-17 signalling. The miRNA miR-155 is expressed in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and positively regulates T<sub>H</sub>17 cell differentiation¹³¹, which may be due to blockade of suppressor of cytokine signalling 1 (SOCS1), a negative regulator of JAK–STAT signalling¹³². Consequently, miR-155-deficient mice or mice in which this miRNA is silenced are resistant to EAE¹³¹,¹³³. In terms of signalling, miR-23b keeps IL-17-induced NF-κB activation in check by targeting TGFβ-activated kinase 2 (TAB2), TAB3 and IKKα for degradation¹³⁴. Consistent with a role for enhanced IL-17 signalling in disease, patients with rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus show reduced expression of miR-23b¹³⁴.

As noted above, C/EBPs regulate IL-17-induced gene expression. Interestingly, C/EBPβ is both a positive and negative regulator of the IL-17 pathway. Although C/EBPβ can positively transactivate IL-17 target genes¹¹⁰, phosphorylation of C/EBPβ by the kinases ERK and GSK3β correlates with a decrease in IL-17-induced gene expression¹¹⁴. Notably, phosphorylation of C/EBPβ by GSK3β is dependent on the CBAD, representing another negative regulatory event mediated by the IL-17RA distal domain¹¹⁴.

**Effector cytokines of T<sub>H</sub>17 cells**

*T<sub>H</sub>17 cells in the steady state.* T<sub>H</sub>17 cells did not evolve to cause autoimmunity but to provide effective host defence against pathogens. Experiments have shown that IL-17- and IL-17R-knockout mice have an increased susceptibility to infection by a wide variety of microorganisms, including bacteria, parasites, fungi and viruses¹³⁵. However, examination of families or individuals with specific mutations in the T<sub>H</sub>17 pathway has indicated a surprisingly limited role for T<sub>H</sub>17 cells and IL-17 in immunity to infection, with susceptibility to commensal fungi (mainly *Candida albicans*) being by far the most dominant cause of disease seen in these settings (TABLE 1). Although the reasons for the dichotomy between mice and humans are still unclear, this is similar to findings in myeloid differentiation primary response protein 88 (MYD88)-deficient humans, who show a relative restricted susceptibility to pyogenic bacteria, in contrast to the broadly susceptible MYD88-knockout mice¹³⁶.

Autoimmune polyendocrinopathy syndrome 1 (APS1; also known as autoimmune polyendocrinopathy candidiasis ectodermal dystrophy (APECED)). An inherited autoimmune disorder that affects multiple endocrine tissues and is caused by mutations in the autoimmune regulator (*AIRE*) gene. The disease is associated with a high incidence of mucocutaneous candidiasis, which is thought to be owing to neutralizing autoantibodies against interleukin-17A (IL-17A), IL-17F and/or IL-22.

As noted above, patients with AD-HIES have dominant-negative mutations in STAT3 that are associated with a reduced frequency of T<sub>H</sub>17 cells and susceptibility to CMC, *Staphylococcus aureus* and pulmonary infections<sup>69,137</sup>. The reduced frequency of T<sub>H</sub>17 cells in CMC is associated with mutations that impair fungal sensing, inhibit IL-23 signalling or enhance negative regulation of T<sub>H</sub>17 differentiation<sup>138–140</sup> (TABLE 1). Similarly, patients with autoimmune polyendocrinopathy syndrome 1 (APS1; also known as autoimmune polyendocrinopathy candidiasis ectodermal dystrophy (APECED) syndrome) suffer from CMC (but no other infections), which is apparently owing to naturally occurring neutralizing antibodies against T<sub>H</sub>17-type cytokines<sup>141,142</sup>. Null mutations in *IL17RA* or *ACT1* and dominant-negative mutations in *IL17F* also promote CMC and some staphylococcal infections<sup>143,144</sup>. Thus, deficiencies in T<sub>H</sub>17 cells and/or IL-17 are strongly linked to defects in fungal immunity and these association studies support data from mouse studies<sup>145</sup>.

T<sub>H</sub>17 cells in disease states. Although T<sub>H</sub>17 cells did not evolve to cause disease, they are programmed to provide formidable host protective responses, which are often associated with the rapid recruitment and activation of granulocytes and macrophages that are capable of producing tissue-damaging reactive oxygen species<sup>146</sup>. During prolonged and dysregulated exposure to IL-1 and IL-23, T<sub>H</sub>17 cells recruit inflammatory myeloid cells that cause severe local tissue injury<sup>38,147</sup>. Experiments using IL-17-, IL-22-, IL23A- or IL-23RA-deficient mice, as well as antibody-mediated inhibition, have demonstrated a requirement for these cytokines in EAE, collagen antibody-induced arthritis, and CIA, and models of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), ankylosing spondylitis and psoriasis<sup>4,5,25,147,148</sup>. On the basis of these preclinical models, as well as human genome-wide association studies (GWASs) and pharmacogenomic disease association analyses, psoriasis, IBD and ankylosing spondylitis have emerged as the leading disease indications for IL-17-specific and IL-23-specific antibody treatments<sup>57–61,149</sup>.

Psoriasis is an immune-mediated inflammatory disorder that is characterized by the activation of both adaptive and innate type 17 responses<sup>150</sup>. The pathogenic involvement of IL-23 in psoriasis is supported by the increased expression of IL-23 in psoriatic lesional skin and its ability to induce psoriasiform characteristics in a preclinical model of intradermal IL-23 administration<sup>148</sup>. The injection of IL-23 promoted dermal acanthosis, neutrophil recruitment, and the infiltration of IL-17- and IL-22-producing T cells. In addition, inhibition of

IL-23 led to a significant reduction of IL-17 and IL-22 levels in psoriatic lesional skin, which supports the role of these cytokines as key regulatory factors in this disease. IL-17-producing CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, γδ T cells and ILCs can all be found in psoriatic skin<sup>151</sup>. Additional skin-resident cells — such as keratinocytes, fibroblasts and endothelial cells — respond to IL-17 and produce autocrine factors that promote rapid cell division and neo-angiogenesis, which strongly contribute to the disease process. The inappropriate secretion of antimicrobial peptides (such as β-defensins, lipocalins, LL-37 (also known as cathelicidin) and S100A7) and chemokines (CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL3, CXCL5, IL-18 and CCL20) by keratinocytes further recruits and activates mast cells, neutrophils and inflammatory macrophages<sup>152</sup>. This interaction between type 17 lymphoid cells and tissue-resident keratinocytes and fibroblasts creates amplification loops that drive epidermal hyperplasia and pro-inflammatory conditions, which are hallmarks of psoriasis.

The seronegative spondyloarthropathies are a heterogeneous group of immunological diseases that follow specific types of viral and bacterial infections and include ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis and reactive arthritis<sup>153</sup>. In contrast to rheumatoid arthritis, in which inflammation is accompanied by bone erosion and destruction, spondyloarthropy is characterized by new bone formation at sites where ligaments attach onto bone, which are known as the entheseal organ. Using a mouse model of spondyloarthritis, we have recently demonstrated the presence of RORγt<sup>+</sup>IL-23R<sup>+</sup>CD3<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>-</sup>CD8<sup>-</sup>SCA1<sup>+</sup> entheseal-resident cells and shown that their production of IL-17 and IL-22 is the major cause of STAT3-dependent osteoblast-mediated bone remodelling<sup>147</sup>. The new bone appears as inappropriate bony outgrowths from spinal vertebrae, which can fuse and immobilize the spine, causing the ultimate morbidity for this disease<sup>154</sup>. This condition is commonly associated with uveitis, aortic valve inflammation, psoriasis and IBD. Indeed, uveitis is a significant comorbidity in ankylosing spondylitis, affecting 40% of patients<sup>155</sup>. In addition, up to 70% of patients with ankylosing spondylitis have microscopically evident bowel inflammation<sup>155</sup>. These observations suggest that there is a fundamental underlying pathology linking these immune disorders. Recently, GWASs have identified multiple SNPs in *IL23R* that are associated with either susceptibility to or protection from ankylosing spondylitis, psoriasis and IBD, or increased susceptibility to these autoimmune conditions<sup>57–61</sup>.

The same *IL23R* SNPs that are found in individuals with ankylosing spondylitis and psoriasis were present in patients with Crohn’s disease, along with SNPs in *NOD2* (nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 2; also known as CARD15), which encodes a sensor of bacterial cell wall components<sup>57,156,157</sup>. This is consistent with the immune system having an elevated T<sub>H</sub>17 cell response in the intestinal mucosa, which is possibly directed against commensal bacterial antigens. Preclinical animal studies have also

identified IL-23 as a key inflammatory mediator that promotes chronic tissue injury responses. In Crohn’s disease, increased expression of IL-17A (at both the mRNA and protein level) has been reported in the intestinal mucosa<sup>158</sup>. Elevated faecal IL-17A levels were also described in active Crohn’s disease<sup>159</sup>. Taken together, these observations implicate the IL-23–IL-17 immune axis in the pathogenesis for Crohn’s disease and related immune disorders — such as psoriasis and spondyloarthropathies — and provide a rationale for developing therapies that target these cytokines.

### Targeting the T<sub>H</sub>17 pathway in disease

IL-17 and IL-23 are emerging as essential factors in the pathogenesis of many autoimmune diseases. Currently, a number of pharmaceutical companies are testing antibodies that target IL-17A, IL-17RA, IL-17A/IL-17F (that is, an antibody recognizing common motifs of the two related cytokines), IL-17A/TNF (a bi-specific antibody with one complementarity-determining region that recognizes IL-17A and the other that recognizes TNF), the p40 subunit of IL-23 and IL-12 (IL-12p40; also known as IL-12β), as well as the p19 subunit of IL-23 (IL-23p19; also known as IL-23A). These antibodies are being trialled in patients with psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, autoimmune uveitis, asthma and multiple sclerosis (TABLE 2). To date, the antibodies that specifically neutralize IL-23 or IL-17A have shown remarkable effectiveness for the treatment of psoriasis. These agents are also showing promising initial results in ankylosing spondylitis and multiple sclerosis.

Currently, four companies are in the final stages of clinical testing of IL-23-specific and IL-17-specific antibodies for psoriasis (TABLE 2) (also see Supplementary information S1 (table)). The Phase II proof-of-concept studies for ixekizumab (an IL-17A-specific antibody), secukinumab (an IL-17A-specific antibody), brodalumab (an IL-17RA-specific antibody), and tildrakizumab (an IL-23p19-specific antibody)<sup>160–163</sup> showed that the inhibition of IL-17, IL-17RA or IL-23p19 had similar safety profiles and therapeutic efficacy (see Supplementary information S1 (table)), which were comparable or better than current standard-of-care drugs, such as ustekinumab (an IL-12p40-specific antibody) and etanercept (a TNF-specific antibody)<sup>164</sup>. All agents showed impressive efficacy, with 70–80% of the patients achieving Psoriasis Activity and Severity Index 75 (PASI-75) — which is defined as having >75% disease clearance — and nearly half reaching PASI-100, a remarkable 100% disease clearance (see Supplementary Information S1 (table)). Currently, all four compounds have advanced to Phase III trials. These clinical data support the concept that IL-17 and IL-23 are key ‘checkpoints’ for the psoriatic inflammatory skin conditions.

Conventional treatment for Crohn’s disease includes immunosuppression with corticosteroids, methotrexate and TNF-specific antibodies. Many patients cannot be treated with these therapies in the long term owing to

On the basis of preclinical studies of IL-17 blockade in models of IBD and the encouraging ustekinumab study, two groups have evaluated IL-17-specific antibodies in patients with IBD. Unexpectedly, trials of brodalumab and secukinumab for Crohn’s disease were terminated owing to a lack of efficacy and/or disease exacerbation ${ }^{166,167}$. None of the treatment groups receiving IL-17RA-specific antibody showed improvement in Crohn’s Disease Activity Index scores compared with patients receiving placebo. Moreover, these trials showed a disproportionate worsening of disease in patients who were treated with IL-17RA-specific antibodies. A higher frequency of fungal infections was observed in patients on secukinumab (9%) compared with placebo (0%), consistent with the possibility that inhibition of IL-17 may increase susceptibility to CMC (see above). However, it is unclear why this condition occurred during secukinumab treatment in patients with Crohn’s disease but not in those with psoriasis. To compound the situation, post hoc analysis revealed that the subgroup of patients who were treated with IL-17RA-specific antibodies and showed disease exacerbation had elevated inflammatory markers, including serum CRP and faecal calprotectin (also known as S100A8–S100A9) ${ }^{166}$, which are known targets of IL-23 and IL-22. It is intriguing that the blockade of IL-17 results in mucosal tissue damage that is associated with upregulation of IL-23 and ROR$\gamma$-dependent inflammatory signals. One plausible explanation is that the basal levels of IL-17 may be gut-protective. Indeed, $I l 17^{-/-}$ mice have increased gut mucosal permeability, predisposing them to higher incidence and severity of IBD ${ }^{168}$, which is perhaps owing to impaired tight junction integrity (C. M. Tato and D.J.C., unpublished observations). These findings may explain the differences between targeting IL-12p40 and IL-23p19 — which leave tonic levels of IL-17 intact — compared with complete ablation of IL-17.

Crohn’s disease, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis ${ }^{165,169}$. However, this treatment strategy is complex. It was initially assumed that IL-23 controls the production of pathogenic IL-17 and that these cytokines are ‘duplicate’ targets. Recent clinical results suggest that is not the case at all. We are now beginning to appreciate that IL-23p19-specific versus IL-17-specific antibody treatments each have their own beneficial effects, as well as each presenting unique challenges in different disease settings. For example, IL-17-specific antibodies showed good therapeutic efficacy for the treatment of psoriasis — even surpassing TNF-specific antibody therapy ${ }^{164,170}$ — but have failed to treat Crohn’s disease. The search for better clinical efficacy biomarkers is crucially needed to improve patient stratification and the selection of particular disease indications. In addition, a better understanding of $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{H}} 17$ cell biology and cellular mechanisms would allow the discovery of additional targets for inflammatory diseases.

Research in deciphering IL-17R-mediated signal transduction cascades has advanced considerably in recent years. Data indicate that although these signaling pathways overlap with IL-1R- and TLR-mediated pathways in many respects, there are also distinct processes that seem to be IL-17 specific. Understanding these events, particularly those that are unique to the IL-17 pathway, may reveal novel treatment strategies. Similarly, new insights into the epigenetic and transcriptional control of $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{H}} 17$ cells have revealed new treatment paradigms. A novel approach could be to destabilize the $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{H}} 17$ cell lineage by inducing reprogramming or functional suppression, which could have immense therapeutic potential. Indeed, the suppression of JAK- and tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2)-dependent STAT3 activation ${ }^{171,172}$, as well as the direct inhibition of ROR$\gamma$ — using small-molecule pharmacologic agents — have demonstrated impressive efficacy in preclinical disease models ${ }^{173-176}$. It is only a matter of time before these new therapeutic approaches will begin to make a difference in the clinic. Thus, the discovery of the IL-23–IL-17 immune axis has brought about fundamental changes in our understanding of cellular immunology and, more importantly, improved the quality of life for many patients.

### Conclusions and perspectives

Since the discovery of the IL-23–$\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{H}} 17$ immune pathway a decade ago, immunologists and clinicians have diligently worked to bring novel therapeutic strategies targeting the IL-23–IL-17 axis to the clinic. Such therapies are now showing encouraging results for psoriasis,
