## Abstract

Antifolates are the first class of antimetabolites introduced to clinic about 6 decades ago. Now, after several years of administration of antifolates against malignancies and particularly leukemia, we are still trying to achieve a full understanding of the mechanisms of action and resistance to these agents. The present article covers different factors able to influence efficacy of antifolates on leukemic cells, the known mechanisms of resistance to methotrexate (MTX) and strategies to overcome these mechanisms. The dominant factors that are contributed to tolerance to cytotoxic effects of MTX including pharmacokinetic factors, impaired transmembrane uptake as the most frequent route of provoking resistance to MTX, augmented drug efflux, impaired intracellular polyglutamation as a determining process of drug efficacy, alterations in expression or activity of target enzymes and increased intracellular folate pools; and finally role of 7-hydroxymethotrexate on response or resistance to MTX will be discussed in more detail. Finally, strategies to overcome resistance to antifolates are discussed.

## Introduction

In the early 1940s the observation of serum folate deficiency in patients with acute leukemia gave rise to the hypothesis that a deficiency in this B-vitamin might actually be the cause of acute leukemia. This hypothesis was supported further by the finding that megaloblasts resembling leukemic blasts predominate in the bone marrow of folate-deficient patients. The isolation of pteroylglutamic acid (folic acid) from spinach in 1941 [1] and subsequent development of procedures for organic synthesis of this compound in 1945 [2], allowed investigators to test this idea by administrating folate to patients with leukemia.

It was soon recognized that not only was such administration ineffective but also it appeared to even accelerate the course of disease in patients with chronic myelocytic leukemia and acute leukemia [3]. Consequently, efforts turned to treating these leuke-

mias by creating folate deficiency. The report that temporary remission could be obtained in 25% of patients with ALL with aminopterin (4-amino-PGA; AMT) [4] provided the first evidence that an antimetabolite could be an effective antineoplastic agent and represented a landmark in cancer chemotherapy.

In mice carrying the L1210 leukemia, methotrexate (MTX) (4-amino-N¹⁰-methylpteroylglutamic acid) (Figure 1) has a more favourable therapeutic index than AMT. As a result, MTX has replaced AMT for clinical approach in recent years.

Although introduction of MTX to ALL therapy has improved the outcome of patients dramatically, the cancer cells of at least 20% of these patients are not susceptible of the cytotoxic effects of this antifolate. Observations concerning both inherent and acquired resistance to MTX have motivated a search for a new generation of antifolates which either themselves inhibit the metabolism of folate or

folate-mediated reactions, or overcome cellular resistance to MTX.

### Clinical administration of MTX

The highly versatile MTX has been one of the most widely administered anticancer drugs during the past half-century. Not only is MTX used to treat malignancies such as choriocarcinoma – lung, mammary gland and ovarian cancer, seminoma, osteogenic sarcoma and ALL – but also for treatment of various autoimmune diseases, such as psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus erythematosus and inflammatory bowel disease, primary biliary cirrhosis and intrinsic asthma, as well as for prevention of graft-versus-host disease. The first cure of a solid tumour, in this case choriocarcinoma, by MTX was reported in 1961 [5], and represented yet another landmark in cancer chemotherapy, that prompted a number of investigators to focus more of their efforts on chemotherapeutic treatment of cancer. Further clinical studies revealed that MTX does not cause long-term toxic effects [6], a highly advantageous characteristic for use in adjuvant therapies. To induce remission in patients with ALL, a high dose of MTX (1–30 g/m² of body surface) is administered by infusion, with subsequent administration of leucovorin as an antidote; whereas for maintenance therapy and prevention of relapse, a low dose of this drug (15–50 mg/m² of body surface/week) is administered orally or by intramuscular injection 1–3 times per week for a period of 2.5–3 years).

### The clinical pharmacology and pharmacokinetics of MTX

Following oral administrations, doses of MTX up to 25 mg/m² are readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Larger doses are not absorbed completely via this route and are therefore administered intravenously. High-dose infusion results in peak plasma concentrations of 0.1–1 mM or higher. The drug disappears from the plasma in a triphasic fashion [7]: first, via rapid distribution; second, by renal clearance (with a t₁/₂ of approximately 2–3 h); and finally, in an elimination phase with a half-life of 8–10 h. The half-life of this third phase is prolonged in patients who suffer from renal failure, which can result in toxic effects on the bone marrow and gastrointestinal tract. Thus, the dose administered to such patients should be adjusted in an appropriate manner.

At pharmacological concentrations, ~50% of serum MTX is bound to plasma proteins. A number of other drugs, including sulfonamides, salicylates,

tetracycline, chloramphenicol and phenytoin, can
displace MTX from albumin and, accordingly,
treatment in combination with non-steroidal anti-
inflammatory drugs has been associated with severe
toxicity caused by MTX. Biliary excretion accounts
for approximately 10% of the overall clearance of this
drug.

In humans, following low-dose administration,
metabolism of MTX is minimal, so that of the
amount taken up, ~90% is excreted unchanged in
the urine within 2 days. In connection with high
doses, however, metabolites, including 7-OHMTX
and diamino-2,4-N-¹⁰-methylpterolic acid (DAM-
PA), accumulate. In such cases 20–46% of the
MTX absorbed is excreted in the urine as 7-
OHMTX, the major metabolite, within 12–24 h
after the start of infusion. 7-OHMTX the main
metabolite is formed through the action of
hepatic aldehyde oxidase [8] and can precipitate in
the kidneys and is considered to be potentially
nephrotoxic.

Although the cytotoxicity of 7-OHMTX has been
estimated to be at least 100-fold less than that of
MTX, its polyglutamated metabolites inhibit the
folate-dependent enzymes thymidylate synthase (TS)
and aminoimidazole carboxamide transformylase
(AICART) with a potency similar to that of MTX
polyglutamates. The concentration of 7-OHMTX in
plasma a few hours after initiation of high-dose
therapy with MTX rises to 1–100 μM, which may be
high enough for this metabolite and/or its polygluta-
mated forms to exert cytotoxic effects. However, the
potential cytotoxicity of 7-OHMTX and underlying
mechanisms have not yet been examined in detail.
The inactive metabolite DAMPA is produced in
smaller amounts via degradation of MTX by
bacterial carboxypeptidase in the lumen of the gut
[9].

### High-dose administration

A dose of MTX that is greater than 0.5 g/m² body
surface area is considered to be high. Such high doses
are applied for treatment of ALL, as well as of
lymphomas and osteogenic sarcoma. High-dose
administration of MTX is followed by vigorous
hydration, alkalization of the urine and administra-
tion of an adequate dose of leucovorin as the rescue
agent, to prevent potentially lethal side effects.

In connection with high-dose therapy, the plasma
pharmacokinetics of MTX can be used to predict
both efficacy and toxicity and, consequently, close
monitoring of plasma levels of MTX is essential in
this connection [10–12]. Furthermore, the choice of
the rescue dose of leucovorin is based on the plasma

concentration of MTX. Unfortunately, the rapid
automated procedures presently used routinely,
suffer from cross-reactivity with metabolites of
MTX [13, 14]. The resulting over-estimation of
concentrations of MTX may lead to the patient
being hospitalized for an unnecessarily long period of
time, as well as receiving an overdose of leucovorin
that increases the risk for relapse [14, 15].

#### Toxic side-effects

The most common and serious toxic side-effect
associated with administration of MTX is myelosup-
pression. Furthermore, intratubular precipitation of
MTX and its metabolites, 7-OHMTX and DAMPA,
in acidic urine causes nephrotoxicity, which can be
prevented by vigorous hydration and alkalization of
the urine. The elevations in the levels of hepatic
enzymes frequently seen in the serum of patients
receiving high doses of MTX are usually reversible
[16–19]. Gastrointestinal mucositis is also a side
effect of treatment with MTX.

#### Mechanisms of action

Following its entry into the cell, primarily via the
reduced folate carrier (RFC) [20], MTX is poly-
glutamated in an adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-
dependent reaction catalyzed by folylpolyglutamate
synthetase (FPGS) [21] (Figure 2). Both MTX and
its polyglutamate metabolites inhibit dihydrofolate
reductase (DHFR). As a consequence of this
inhibition, regeneration of tetrahydrofolate (THF)
from dihydrofolate is impaired, leading to a defi-
ciency in THF and formation of various one-carbon
adducts in replicating cells. This, in turn, results in
inhibition of the synthesis of both purines and
thymidine, inhibition of DNA replication and,
finally, cell death. Moreover, the polyglutamates
(MTX-PGs) can inhibit TS, as well as certain other
enzymes involved in the de novo biosynthesis of
purines (PDNS), e.g., glyciamide ribonucleotide
formyltransferase (GARFT) and AICART [22].
Because the polyglutamated metabolites of MTX
remain in the cell much longer than the parent drug
itself, polyglutamylation determines the efficacy of
MTX as a cytotoxic agent.

#### Transport of MTX

##### Influx mechanisms

Folate carriers. Uptake of MTX into human cells is
mediated primarily by the human reduced folate
carrier (hRFC), which has long been known to play a

major role in the uptake of both reduced folate cofactors and this drug [23]. RFC (SLC19A1) is a member of the superfamily of major facilitators, a large group of carriers that transport various organic and inorganic compounds across the membranes of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells [24]. The RFC gene is located on human chromosome 21 (21q22.2–q22.3). It is an integral polytopic plasma membrane protein containing 591 amino acids, with 12 transmembrane domains (TMDs), a short N-terminus and a long C-terminus, both of which reside in the cytoplasm [25].

The human RFC contains a single N-linked glycosylation site at the first extracellular loop (L1), and it undergoes heavy glycosylation thereby rendering it a broadly migrating protein with a molecular mass [26]. RFC (SLC19A1) is a member of the major facilitator superfamily, a large group of carriers that transport diverse organic and inorganic compounds in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes [24]. Within the major facilitator superfamily is a small family of facilitative solute carriers consisting of RFC/SLC19A1, SLC19A2 [27] and SLC19A3 [28].

The hRFC shares 39% ± 40% identity and 55% ± 58% similarity with SLC19A2 and SLC19A3 of amino acids [28]. It has been recently shown that both SLC19A2 [27] and SLC19A3 [28] function as thiamine transporters and have therefore been termed ThTr1 [27] and ThTr2 [29]. Despite the high degree of structural similarity of SLC19A1 with the other SLC19As, there is no functional overlap. The SLC19A1 is an anion transporter and does not transport the cation thiamine and the thiamine carriers do not transport reduced folates [29]. RFC is a classic facilitative transporter that functions as a bidirectional anion exchanger [30, 31] taking up folate cofactors and extruding various organic anions, including thiamine pyrophosphate [32].

RFC actually transports MTX more efficiently than folic acid in its oxidised form. At least one additional transport system for folic acid capable of also transporting MTX exists, but this system does not appear to play a role in resistance to MTX [33]. Both of these systems are energy-dependent, i.e., perform active uptake. Moreover, at high concentrations MTX can diffuse across the cell membrane [34].

Several years after the introduction of antifolates as anti-cancer agents, impaired cellular uptake was recognized as one mechanism of resistance to these agents [35, 36]. Today, a defect in RFC-mediated transport has been established as the primary and most frequent mechanism of resistance to MTX, not only in human tumour cell lines [37] but also in the clinic [38, 39]. Molecular basis for such defective transport has been examined by several different groups.

For instance, in the case of the MTX-resistant L1210 cell line MTX uptake was restored completely by an A130P mutation in the third TMD of RFC [40]. In a CCRF-CEM cell line Jansen et al. [37] found that a Glu45Lys mutation in the first TMD of this transporter enhanced uptake of folic acid, resulting in several-fold elevation in the size of the

intracellular pools of folate and, consequently, an
abolition of polyglutamylation that conferred resistance to antifolates whose action are dependent on
such polyglutamylation, e.g., ZD1694, DDATHF
(5, 10-dideazatetrahydrofollic acid) and AG2034, and
even to lipophilic antifolates trimetrexate and pyrimethamine. Roy et al. [41] discovered that the
intrinsic resistance of sarcoma 180 cells to MTX, in
comparison with L1210 leukemia cells, is due to a
single difference in the amino acid sequence of RFC
(Ser in L1210 and Asn in the sarcoma 180 cells). A
novel mechanism of antifolate resistance, described
by Rothem et al. [42] involves altered expression and
function of transcription factors that results in
transcriptional silencing of the RFC gene. Later on
the same group demonstrated that antifolate-resistance can be acquired due to loss of function of
CREB-1 as a result of lack of CREB-1 phosphorylation [43]. This resulted in a markedly impairment of
antifolate transport due to downregulation of RFC
gene expression, the latter of which is highly
dependent on CREB-1 function. Antifolate-resistant
cells frequently display loss of CRE-binding due to
impaired signalling via the cAMP-Protein Kinase A
(PKA) pathway [42, 43].

We have recently shown in our laboratory that
defected RFC-mediated transport in MTX resistant
CCRF-CEM cells was associated with transcriptional
silencing of the RFC gene, due to attenuated or even
abolished binding of various transcription factors to
their cis-acting elements, including the CRE, E-box,
AP1, Mzf-1 and GC-box [44].

Defective transport also plays a role in resistance to
other hydrophilic antifolates. Thus, resistance to
PT523 and ZD9331 acquired in vitro has been
shown to be due to a defect in RFC-mediated
transport. Moreover, the efficiency of transport by
RFC correlates well with the pharmacological profiles of antifolate drugs [34, 45, 46].

We have further shown, that MTX resistant
leukemic cells with defected RFC-mediated transport as their main mechanism of resistance, strongly
expressed cross-resistance to other hydrophilic antifolates ZD1694, ZD9331 and AG2037, whereas they
retain sensitivity to the lipophilic antifolate trimetrexate [44] (Figure 3).

Another mechanism of influx for antifolates is via
folate receptors (FRs). However, the affinity of RFC
to antifolates is much higher, and FRs usually do not
play an important role in transport of MTX, when
RFC presents at sufficient levels [33].

Other transporters. Several organic anion carriers that
are expressed at the highest levels in the liver and
kidneys can also transport MTX, some with affinities
comparable with that of RFC. However, the con-
approximately five-fold more resistant to short-term exposure to MTX than untransfected cells [54].

To date, at least four members of MRP family (MRP1-4) have been found to mediate the efflux of MTX but not of the polyglutamated forms of MTX out of cells [55, 56]. Interestingly, transfection of cells with these MRPs confers resistance to MTX primarily in connection with brief exposure (4 h) [53, 54, 57]. Active efflux by MRPs reduces intracellular levels of free MTX, and consequently, the rate of formation of polyglutamated forms of this drug, which cannot be transported out. Later, during the withdrawal period, MTX-monoglutamate will be pumped out rapidly by MRPs, thus preventing cytotoxicity. Inhibition of MRP-mediated efflux by probenecid reversed the antifolate-resistance in MRP-transfected cells [53]. However, the significance of MRPs in connection with resistance to MTX has not yet been established in clinical situations.

Permeability glycoprotein. The capability of the permeability (p-) glycoprotein (Pgp) an ATP-dependent integral membrane transporter encoded by the human multidrug resistance 1 (MDR1) gene, to export many hydrophobic xenobiotics out of cells provides protection from toxic substances and metabolites. The existence of an active exporter in cell membrane was first reported by Dano in 1973 [58]. Later, in 1976, Juliano and Ling [59] found that the alterations in cell membrane permeability exhibited by a multi-drug-resistant Chinese hamster ovary cell were due to a glycoprotein with a molecular weight of 170 kDa, which they called the Pgp. Pgp is an ATP-dependent integral membrane transporter encoded by the human MDR1 gene, which carries out efflux of lipophilic compounds and as a physiological role, protects cells from toxic substances or metabolites. Pgp cannot efflux hydrophilic drugs such as MTX. Accordingly, cell lines selected for resistance to the lipophilic antifolate trimetrexate overexpress Pgp, but demonstrate no cross-resistance to MTX [60]. Apparently, resistance to MTX associated with elevated expression of Pgp occurs solely under circumstances where RFC-mediated transport of this drug is defective [61, 62].

Breast cancer resistant protein. In the early 1990s observation of transport-mediated resistance to mitoxantrone in a few cell lines without altered expression of MDR1 and MRP1 [63–65] encouraged a search for new transporters. In 1992, Nawagata et al. [64] examined a mitoxantrone-resistant human MCF-7 breast cancer cell line that exhibited cross-resistance to doxorubicin and etoposide, but not to vinblastine, which is well known to be

transported by Pgp. The reduced intracellular accumulation of mitoxantrone in these cells is associated with enhanced drug efflux and is reversed by both an inhibitor (sodium azide) and uncoupler (2,4-dinitrophenol) of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, indicating that the efflux is energy dependent.

A similar pattern of MDR was observed in another breast cancer cell line, MCF-7, that was made resistant to adriamycin in the presence of the verapamil [66], which do not overexpress either Pgp or MRP1. Later on, in 1997, Lee et al. [67] reported enhanced ATP-dependent efflux and reduced accumulation of daunomycin and rhodamine in this resistant cell line. This provided further evidence for the existence of a novel ATP-dependent xenobiotic transporter.

In 1998, Doyle et al. [68] finally identified this transporter and named it the breast cancer resistant protein (BCRP). It is now known that BCRP is a member of the ATP-binding cassette superfamily of transporters that confer cellular resistance to a wide range of antineoplastic agents, including mitoxantrone, doxorubicin, daunorubicin and topotecan. The specificity of this protein is strongly influenced by the nature of the amino acid 482.

Ignorance of this fact initially caused doubt about the ability of BCRP to export MTX. Thus, Volk et al. [69] observed cross-resistance to MTX in a mitoxantrone-resistant breast cancer cell line and tried unsuccessfully to confirm the involvement of BCRP by transfection of these cells with BCRP cDNA that carried a mutation in codon 482. At first, it was postulated the existence of a novel MTX-specific efflux pump, but these investigators subsequently found that MTX resistance is correlated with overexpression of the wild-type, but not of the R482T or R482G mutant forms of BCRP [70]. With the exception of a five-fold enhancement in resistance to AG337, the mitoxantrone-resistant cells that overexpressed BCRP showed no cross-resistance to other antifolates (e.g. ZD1694 and DDATHF), suggesting that these are poor ligands for BCRP-mediated efflux [69].

Interestingly, in contrast to the ability of MRP1-4 to export only monoglumate forms of folates and MTX, BCRP has recently been reported to transport mono-, di- and triglutamate conjugates of folic acid and MTX out of cells in vitro [71, 72] (Figure 2). This unique ability may explain the long-term resistance of cells transfected with BCRP cDNA to MTX [70]. However, the effect of BCRP on the accumulation of the polyglutamated forms of MTX (MTXGLs) in intact cells remains unclear [73]. Successful strategies designed to reduce the expression and/or activity of BCRP have been developed
and may prove useful in overcoming drug resistance
in the clinic [74].

Impact of covalent conjugation with
polyglutamate residues on the effect of
antifolates

Polyglutamylation by FPGS

Following influx across the cell membrane MTX
undergoes polyglutamylation, in the same manner as
physiological folate coenzymes. This process involves
sequential γ-linkage of as many as 6 glutamyl
residues to the terminal glutamyl moiety of the
molecule, and is catalyzed by the cytoplasmic enzyme
FPGS [75]. The MTXGLs, like those of the natural
folate coenzymes, are metabolized further only
slowly.
MTXGLs exhibit much longer intracellular half-
lives than the original monoglutamated MTX
(MTX-GL1) and can thus be accumulated for longer
periods of time. This is due to the fact that these
congeners are transported by almost none of the
folate transport systems [76], with the exception of
BCRP/ABCG2, which has recently been shown to
export both mono- and polyglutamates of folates and
MTX [72]. MTXGLs retain ability to inhibit DHFR
[77] and, in addition, inhibit several other enzymes
involved in the de novo biosynthesis of deoxythymi-
dylate and purines, such as TS, GARFT and
AICART.
Thus, the extent and rate of polyglutamylation is as
a determining factor for MTX cytotoxicity [78].
However, in the case of other antifolates, the impact
of polyglutamylation differs, although in all cases
polyglutamylation enhances accumulation and usual-
ly increases the degree of binding to enzymes which
require THF as a cofactor. For instance, polygluta-
mylation significantly increases the affinity of TS for
ZD1694 and pemetrexed for TS [79] and of GARFT
for pemetrexed and DDATHF [79, 80].
Impaired polyglutamylation contributes to MTX
resistance most significantly when exposure is limited
to a few hours, because MTX-monoglutamate is
itself a potent inhibitor of DHFR. However, in
connection with such brief exposure, which resem-
bles clinical pulse therapy, only MTX that is retained
intracellularly, i.e., polyglutamated forms, contribute
to the toxic effects of this drug. A number of studies
have revealed that attenuated polyglutamylation is
one mechanism underlying acquired resistance to
MTX [81, 82].
In this connection, the intrinsic resistance of
acute non-lymphocytic cells to MTX in comparison
with ALL cells, particularly during short-term
exposure as well as the more pronounced tolerance

to MTX and poorer prognosis associated with T-
than B-lymphoblastic leukemia has been explained
on the basis of lower capacities to produce long-chain
polyglutamated forms of MTX [83–85] Interestingly, blasts from acute monocytic leukemia [M5
subtype of acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML)]
patients which can accumulate high amounts of
MTXPGs are relatively sensitive to MTX [86]. In
another study on blasts of two children with acute
megakaryoblastic leukemia (M7 subtype of AML), the
MTXGLs’ accumulation following exposure to radi-
olabeled MTX were detected to be at similar levels as
in ALL blasts [87]. This means that the probability of
efficacy of MTX for treatment of acute monocytic
and megakaryocytic leukemias is sensible to be
investigated.

In attempts to explain the molecular basis for the
difference accumulation in long-chain MTXGLs in
ALL and AML cells, Longo et al. [88] observed two-
fold higher K_m values of FPGS for MTX in the AML
cells. This finding may be explained by the presence
of alternative splice variants of the FPGS gene.
Moreover, the isoforms of FPGS are probably
expressed [89–91], or/and subject to post-
translational modifications [92] in a tissue-specific
manner.

Hydrolysis by folypolyglutamate hydrolase

As in the case for folate-polyglutamates, MTXGLs
are hydrolysed in lysosomes, following uptake by a
facilitated transport system [93]. The enzyme in-
volved is active only at very low pH and has been
given several different names, e.g., folypolyglutamate
hydrolase (FPGH), γ-glutamyl hydrolase and γ-Glu-
X carboxypeptidase. Because FPGH counteracts the
reactions catalyzed by FPGS, enhanced activity of
this hydrolase can be expected to lower intracellular
accumulation of polyglutamated MTX and thereby
confer different degrees of tolerance. Indeed since
1993, several reports have emphasized the contribu-
tion of high FPGH activity to cellular resistance to
MTX [94, 95], as well as to other non-classic
antifolates DDATHF whose cytotoxicity requires
polyglutamylation [95, 96].
However, transfection of HT-1080 (a human
fibroblastoma) or MCF-7 (a breast cancer) cell lines
with FPGH cDNA does not confer resistance to
short-term exposure to MTX [97]. Because in both
of these cell lines, the alterations in the accumulation
of MTX resulting from overexpression of FPGH
were accompanied by changes in accumulation of
folate, these investigators proposed that the ratio of
MTX/folate may be a better predictor of MTX
cytotoxicity than the level of either these substances
alone. Clinical studies on patients with leukemia have

revealed that the ratio of FPGS/FPGH activity at the time of diagnosis is a useful predictor of response to MTX and therapeutic outcome [98, 99].

### Influence of the size of THF-cofactor pools on the response to antifolates

Modulation of the activity of antifolates as a consequence of alterations in the size of THF-cofactor pools are well known to occur [100–102]. This pool exerts a regulatory effect on the synthesis of MTX polyglutamates [103] and thereby the toxicity of antifolates [104]. Large pools are associated with resistance in particular to antifolates that require polyglutamylation for their effect [105], whereas cells grown in the presence of low levels of folic acid are more sensitive to MTX and many other antifolates [37]. In one such study, where L1210 cells were cultured in the presence of different concentrations of 5-methylenetetrahydrofolate (5-CHO-THF), the intracellular concentrations of DDATHF and pemetrexed attained were negatively correlated to intracellular levels of folate, with enlargement of the folate pool resulting in much higher IC₅₀ values for these agents [102]. In contrast, the size of the folate pool had no influence on the cytotoxicity of the polyglutamate-independent antifolate ZD9331 and the effect on MTX toxicity was slight.

In fact, the influence of intracellular THF cofactor pools on the cytotoxicity of polyglutamylation-dependent drugs is more pronounced when the period of exposure is too short to allow significant accumulation of the polyglutamated forms of these drugs [102]. Interestingly, various groups have reported that cells which are resistant to MTX, as a consequence of a defect in RFC-mediated transport exhibit enhanced sensitivity to lipophilic antifolates whose uptake is not impaired by this defect. For instance, transport-defective cells resistant to MTX are more sensitive to DDATHF [106], as well as to two other lipophilic antifolates, AG377 and trimetrexate [107]. Under such circumstances, the defect in RFC leads to depletion of the intracellular folate pool and, in this way to lesser competition for interaction with DHFR.

In the clinic, the levels of folate in the plasma or erythrocytes prior to treatment have not been useful in predicting which patients will develop toxicity following administration of antifolates. However, supplementation with folic acid can protect patients receiving low doses of MTX from toxicity without lessening the efficacy of the drug [108, 109]. In a similar manner, oral co-administration of folic acid diminishes the clinical toxicity of DDATHF [110] and pemetrexed [111].

### DHFR

DHFR catalyses the NADPH-dependent reduction of dihydrofolate to THF, an essential step in de novo synthesis of glycine and of purines and deoxythymidine phosphate, which are precursors for DNA synthesis. MTX is believed to exert its cytotoxicity primarily through inhibition of DHFR [112]. Such inhibition should decrease intracellular levels of reduced folates, augment accumulation of dihydrofolate, attenuate de novo synthesis of precursors required for DNA synthesis and lead finally to cell death.

At the same time, sustained exposure to MTX can evoke an increase in the activity of DHFR [113] as a result of gene amplification, thereby altering the response to MTX [114–116]. This phenomenon has been observed in ALL patients [117, 118] and in tissue specimens of the patients with ovarian cancer [119] and probably contributes to clinical resistance to this drug. An alternative mechanism for such resistance are mutations which decrease the affinity of DHFR for MTX [120] without decreasing the catalytic activity of this enzyme to the same extent [121–124]. However, such mutations have not to date been shown to be clinically relevant.

TS catalyses the conversion of 5,10-methylene THF to dihydrofolate, as well as of deoxyuridine monophosphate to deoxythymidine monophosphate. Because the latter reaction is the sole source of deoxythymidylylate for DNA biosynthesis, TS has become an important target for cancer chemotherapy. Inhibition of this enzyme leads to depletion of deoxythymidine triphosphate enhanced misincorporation of uracil into nucleic acids subsequent chromosomal damage and apoptotic cell death [125, 126]. MTXGLs can inhibit TS, by binding directly to this enzyme, whereas the MTX inhibits TS indirectly by diminishing the level of 5,10-methylene THF.

Augmentation of TS activity, which is usually due to gene amplification, is a common mechanism underlying resistance to MTX [127], and the major mechanism of resistance to other agents that target TS, i.e. fluorouracil, pemetrexed, AG337, ZD1694 and ZD9331 [128–130]. Alterations in the stability of the TS polypeptide accompany, indeed, even contribute to resistance to inhibitors of this enzyme acquired by colon tumour cells [130]. Such resistance can result from mutations in the TS gene that alter drug binding [131] or produce an unstable enzyme molecule that is rapidly degraded, lowering TS levels [130].

In a clinical study, Krajnovic et al. [132] demonstrated an association between a tandem-repeat polymorphism in the promoter of the TS gene with a homozygous triple repeat leading to enhanced expression of this enzyme and poorer outcome for children with ALL treated with MTX. These investigators concluded that genotyping might help to provide appropriate individualized treatment for patients with ALL. In agreement with their findings, a higher frequency of the homozygous triple repeat is present in patients with rheumatoid arthritis who require higher doses of MTX for successful treatment [133]. Because MTX is a less critical element in the patients with low glutathione transferase activity, a polymorphism in TS was less important as a predictive factor of response to therapy in the low activity genotype of glutathione transferase [134].

Recent studies have revealed that certain mutations in TS lead to highly selective differences in the binding of various inhibitors. Thus, an HT1080 cell line resistant to AG337 and carrying Lys47Glu and Asp49Gly mutations was cross-resistant to fluorouracil, but not to ZD1694 or GW1843U89 [129]. Such selective effects have been confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis of highly conserved residues. With this approach, Ile108Ala mutation was found to confer high level of resistance to ZD1694 and AG337, but not to GW1843U89; whereas a Phe225Trp mutation resulted in a 17-fold elevation in resistance to GW1843U89, but less enhancement of resistance to fluorouracil [135].

### Pharmacogenetic determinants of the response to MTX

The predictive value of several genetic variants and gene-gene interactions with respect to response to MTX therapy has been examined. The genes studied most extensively in this context are those encoding 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) and TS. MTHFR converts 5,10-methylene-THF into 5-methyl-THF, the major circulating form of folate and the source of the methyl group for homocysteine methylation (Figure 4). MTHFR plays a vital role in channelling single-carbon units to methylation reactions [136], and alterations in the activity of this enzyme can lead to an imbalance in the folate pools [137], which, as explained above, might result in altered sensitivity to MTX. Two common polymorphisms in the MTHFR gene, i.e. a C677T [138] and an A1298C [139, 140] transition, have been described. Homozygous TT677 or CC1298 cells exhibit reduced enzyme activity, whereas in heterozygous individuals this activity is also decreased, but to a lesser extent [138–140]. The influence of these polymorphisms and, in particular that of the C677T substitution on the pharmacodynamics of antifolates, both in vitro and in connection with clinical response to and outcome of MTX treatment, have been characterized by a number of investigators [141, 142]. Possibly, other polymorphisms in the MTHFR or other genes (e.g. those encoding cystathionine-β-synthase and methionine synthase) might alter the reduced folate pathway and thereby the cytotoxicity of MTX [141]. Recently, we have investigated the changes in mRNA gene expressions of a MOLT4 cell line selected for resistance to MTX due to defective RFC-mediated uptake of MTX employing Affymetrix microarray chips. In addition to two-fold reduction of expression of RFC-mRNA in concordances to the major mechanism of resistance, a number of mRNA expression alterations detected among the genes involved in folate metabolism (Figure 4). For instance, a two-fold reduction in expression of cystathionine-β-synthase and four-fold augmentation in expression of MTHFR, which aimed at preserving intracellular reduced folate pools was detected (unpublished data).

Furthermore, in CCRF-CEM cells a change of G to T at position 1037 in FPGScDNA resulting in the substitution of Phe for the native Cys at residue 346 (Cys346Phe), can give rise to resistance to polyglutamylation-dependent antifolates (Cys346Phe) [143]. The potential influence of this mutation on clinical response to MTX therapy and the risk for relapse is not yet known.

Because the primary mechanism underlying the cytotoxicity of MTX involves tight binding to and inhibition of the enzyme DHFR, an elevation in the intracellular level of DHFR would be expected to cause resistance to MTX. Indeed, the copy number of the DHFR gene may be a determinant for the response to and toxicity associated with MTX treatment [144]. On the other hand, a minor study has indicated that mutations in DHFR are unlikely to be a major mechanism for acquired resistance in patients exposed to MTX [145].

No polymorphism in GARFT or AICART, the two enzymes essential for PDNS, has yet been described.

In addition to alterations in genes whose products are involved in the metabolism of folate and MTX, changes in certain other genes, e.g., those whose products regulate the cell cycle or participate in the apoptotic cascade have been reported to contribute to resistance to MTX. Thus, in 1995 Li et al. [146] observed several-fold higher IC₅₀ values for MTX and 5-fluorodeoxyuridine in two different cell lines expressing no or non-functional retinoblastoma protein, which is involved in regulating the S-phase of the cell cycle. The same cell lines that lacked

retinoblastoma protein, expressed high levels of free E2F, which binds to the DHFR and TS promoters and activates transcription of these genes. Moreover, elevated expression of Bcl-XL and Bcl-2, which regulate apoptosis [147], as well as mutations in the p53 gene can provide various degrees of tolerance to the toxic effects of MTX [148]. The 870A > G polymorphism in the cyclin D1 (CCND1) gene modulates mRNA splicing, leading to altered protein that may affect the regulation of the G1/S cell-cycle checkpoint. This polymorphism has been reported to influence susceptibility to and progression of several malignancies. Furthermore, the change of retinoblastoma protein regulation mediated by CCND1 may play a role in the development of MTX resistance via an associated higher activity of enzymes that are inhibited by MTX. This study shows that children with ALL who are homozygous for the CCND1A variant have a lower probability of event-free survival compared to carriers of the G variant [149]. In an investigation of the relationship between the risk of relapse in ALL patients and functional polymorphisms in genes encoding carcinogen-metabolizing enzymes, carriers of CYP1A1*2A and NQO1*2 variants had worse disease prognosis, and hMLH1 Ile 219 contributed to the increased risk of relapse when combined with the CYP1A1*2A variant [150]. There has been an ongoing controversy about the effect by glutathione S-transferase genotype on the outcome of childhood ALL. A large

study on 710 children with ALL revealed that in
contrast to some previous studies, glutathione S-
transferase genotype does not affect etiology or
outcome of childhood ALL [151]. Recently, Rocha
et al. [134] have observed a greater risk of haema-
tologic relapse in high-risk ALL patients with the
(GSTM1) non-null genotype of this gene.

Interactions between MTX and its metabolites

In light of the fact that, like MTX and reduced folate
cofactors, 7-OHMTX is taken up by cells via the
RFC [21], this metabolite can compete for such
uptake, as well as for intracellular pathways of
metabolism. Concentrations of 7-OHMTX that are
approximately three-fold higher than those of MTX
have been detected in the bone marrows of children
24h after receiving an oral dose of MTX [7]. This
metabolite is a good substrate for FPGS, being
polyglutamylated at least at the same rate and at least
to the same extent as MTX [20, 21], and is therefore
speculated to compete with MTX and natural folates
for polyglutamylation. Furthermore, the half-life of
7-OHMTX in the body is about three times longer
than that of MTX [152], which allows this metabolite
to interfere with the effects of MTX for the entire
period that this drug remains in the body.

7-OHMTX may be a cytotoxic metabolite

Because of the low affinity of its binding to DHFR, 7-
OHMTX has been considered to be an inactive
metabolite of MTX [153, 154]. Indeed, 7-OHMTX
is more than 100-fold less cytotoxic towards cells
than MTX. However, as mentioned above, the half-
life of 7-OHMTX is much longer [152] and
following HDMTX therapy, the plasma concentra-
tion of 7-OHMTX can be several-fold higher
(>1 μM for as long as a few days) than that of
MTX [155], i.e. sufficient to exert toxic effects.
Furthermore, polyglutamylated form of 7-OHMTX
are much better inhibitors of DHFR than the
monoglutarated form [156]. Thus, the ki values
for inhibition of TS and AICART by 7-
OHMTXGLs are <1 μM, so that these enzymes of
PDNS can also be inhibited. Despite all these
indications that 7-OHMTX may act as a cytotoxic
agent following HDMTX therapy, the possible
mechanisms of action and ability of this metabolite
to induce resistance in leukemic cells have simply
been neglected.
Regarding these facts, we had hypothesised and
then showed in two human leukemia cell lines, that
7-OHMTX, the major metabolite of MTX is able to
independently act as a cytotoxic drug and evoke
resistance [44]. Actually, 7-OHMTX can induce
resistance by a mechanism different from that by
which MTX induces resistance. The underlying
mechanism of resistance to 7-OHMTX in both
resistant cell lines was a >95% fall in FPGS activity,
whereas the way that MTX-resistant cells acquired
tolerance was via a defect in RFC-mediated transport
of MTX. The ability of 7-OHMTX to provoke
resistance by a distinct route than of parental
drug, maybe the case in clinic, as well; a hypothesis
that demands further clinical investigations for
evaluation.

Strategies to improve MTX therapy

Individualization of therapy

Because there is a relation between systemic ex-
posure to chemotherapy and anticancer effects [157],
and on the other hand pharmacokinetic parameters
of MTX show big discrepancies among patients, the
best dosage of MTX for each patient may differ, and
a dosage based on area of body surface or weight may
not be the proper one for all patients. Patients with
high clearance rates of MTX may be under the
higher risk of relapse and patients with very low
clearance can experience drug toxicity.
Decision of MTX dosage based on rate of
elimination for each individual patient has benefit
to the conventional calculation of dosage based on
body surface and improves the outcome of children
with ALL [158].

Developing novel antifolates

Improved understanding of the normal folate phy-
siology, the intracellular metabolism of MTX, the
mode of MTX cytotoxicity, and mechanisms of
resistance to MTX at the molecular level provides a
basis for rational design of novel folate antagonists.
Newer antifolates are designed to possess one or
more of the following properties: (1) more effective
transport into the cell due either to increased affinity
for the RFC or enhanced lipophilicity, which lessens
dependency on RFC-mediated transport (e.g. trime-
trexate and AG337); (2) cytotoxicity that is indepen-
dent of polyglutamylation (e.g., trimetrexate,
ZD9331 and AG337); and/or (3) more extensive
polyglutamylation due to higher affinity for FPGS
and, consequently, more potent inhibition of DHFR
and/or TS, and/or enhanced ability to inhibit a
number of other targets (such as enzymes responsible
for purine and pyrimidine synthesis) (e.g. edatrexate,
pemetrexed, lometrexol and LY309887). All novel
antifolates in various stages of development exhibit
their own unique clinical pharmacology. In 2004, the
FDA approved the use of pemetrexed for treatment

of malignant pleural mesothelioma in patients who
are not candidates for resection or curative surgery.
Although the major target in connection with the
development of novel antifolates has been DHFR
and TS, other critical folate-dependent enzymes,
such as methionine synthetase, MTHFR and FPGS,
should also be considered in this context.

However, despite the fact that some promising
results with novel antifolates have been achieved
during the past two decades, the most significant
improvements in cancer chemotherapy have been
based on optimization of available protocols rather
than administration of new drugs.

Employing high-performance liquid chromatography for
analysis of MTX in connection with HDMTX therapy

To identify patients with ALL who have a high risk of
developing toxic effects despite adequate rescue, the
plasma level of MTX must be monitored frequently,
both during and after administration of HDMTX.
Because the automated procedures available for the
determination of MTX concentrations in plasma
suffer from interference by 7-OHMTX and DAMPA,
the MTX concentration is overestimated when high
concentrations of these metabolites are also present
[13, 14]. Following HDMTX therapy, the choice of
the dose of leucovorin to be administered is based on
the plasma concentration of MTX and, therefore,
such overestimation can result in overdosage with
leucovorin, which has recently been shown to increase
the risk of relapse in children treated for ALL [15].
Thus, doubling the dose of leucovorin increased this
risk by 22%. Accurate measurement of plasma
concentrations of MTX can be achieved using
HPLC, the golden standard for separating and
quantitating MTX and its metabolites at nanomolar
concentrations and without mutual interference.

Conclusions

The bases for intrinsic and acquired mechanisms of
resistance to MTX can be explained within the
context of the mechanisms of drug influx, activation
and efflux and cytotoxic determinants of MTX. In
general, impaired drug uptake, augmented drug
export, impaired polyglutamation by FPGS, in-
creased hydrolysis via FPGH, alterations in target
enzymes and high amounts of intracellular THF
pools and finally interaction with metabolites can be
considered as the mechanisms behind of a poor
response to MTX and other antifolates. Employing
strategies to individualize the dosage of MTX based
on host pharmacokinetics, developing novel antifo-
lates that can overcome the mechanisms of resistance
to MTX, and finally discovery of novel targets for

Antifolate resistance and methotrexate efficacy 421
MTX using gene-array technologies may further
improve HDMTX therapy and the outcome of ALL
patients.
