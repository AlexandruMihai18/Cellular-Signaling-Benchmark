2. Targeting nascent cathepsins to lysosomes

Cathepsins L, B, D and H are the major lysosomal proteases and they primarily determine the proteolytic capacity of lysosomes. Cathepsins are synthesized as pre-pro-enzymes (Hasilik, 1992) (Fig. 1). The pre-peptide drives the cathepsin precursor in
distribution between the myofibrillar core and surface in fast-twitch fibers (Ralston et al., 1999). Using fluid-phase markers in isolated myofibers, Kaitso, Rahkila, Marjomaki, Parton, and Metsikko (1999) showed that late endosomes and lysosomes localize predominantly around myonuclei beneath the sarcolemma,
exhibit a more limited distribution and tissue-specific function (Driessen et al., 1999; Gelb, Shi, Chapman, & Desnick, 1996).

As endopeptidase activities proceed, new C- and N-terminal residues are generated and they become substrates for exopeptidases. The major lysosomal carboxypeptidases are cathepsin
tissues (Deval, Bechet, Obled, & Ferrara, 1990; Dufour et al., 1987). Muscle cathepsins were identified in various species, including human, rat, mouse, bovine, pig, chicken or fish. Similar enzymatic properties were observed for different muscles, independently of their metabolic and contractile type. Slow-twitch oxidative muscles
cells do express lysosomal cathepsins and that the specific activities of cathepsins increase during the fusion of fetal myoblasts (Bechet et al., 1991) and of adult satellite cells (Kirschke et al., 1983). The implication of proteolytic enzymes in myoblast-myotube differentiation has been suspected for a long time, and metallo
expressed in several muscles of septic rats ([Deval et al., 2001](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0304-4165(00)00187-9)). Compared to other muscle lysosomal and non-lysosomal endopeptidases, cathepsin L is induced early in catabolic states
patients with DMRV, with increased cathepsins B and H located in vacuoles in subsarcolemmal perinuclear and intermyofibrillar regions (Li et al., 1986). Therefore, activation of the lysosomal system with increased expression of cathepsins appears as an early response to myofibrillar damage in various types of myopathies.

5.2. Chaperone-mediated autophagy

A selective degradation of cytoplasmic proteins by lysosomes can be achieved in mammalian cells through chaperone-mediated autophagy. The substrates for this selective pathway of lysosomal proteolysis are cytoplasmic proteins bearing sequences related to the pentapeptide Lys-Phe-Glu-Arg-Gln (KFERQ). Among recognized substr
important for the recruitment of lipid-conjugated LC3 to isolation membranes (Mizushima et al., 2001); (iv) Atg12-Atg5 conjugate detaches from the isolation membrane before autophagosome formation is completed; (v) Atg1 complex likely functions at a late step of autophagosome formation (Mizushima et al., 200
the co-localization of LC3 with autophagosomes in
chloroquine myopathy and in another myopathy with
rimmed vacuole (DMRV), suggesting increased mus-
cle macroautophagy in these diseases.

### 5.4.2. Pompe disease

Lysosomal storage diseases are inborn metabolic
disorders characterized by the accumulation of
non-metabolized material inside lys
myofibers. The etiology of many of these myopathies remains unknown. However, chloroquine intoxication, Pompe and Danon diseases indicate that myopathies can result from mis-regulation of lysosomal acidity, deficiencies of lysosomal membrane protective protein or of lysosomal hydrolase. Strikingly, these deficiencies will target lysosomes in every tissue, but nevertheless they preferentially generate myopath
olytic pathway in aging. *Journal of Clinical Investigation*, 96, 2113–2119.
