Human gliomas are the most common primary central nervous system neoplasm, and they are a complex, heterogeneous, and difficult disease to treat. In the past two decades, advances in molecular biology have revolutionized our understanding of the mechanism by which these neoplasms are initiated and progress. While surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy have roles to play in the treatment of patients with gliomas; these therapies are self-limited because of the intrinsic resistance of glioma cells to therapy, and the diffusely infiltrating nature of the lesions. It is now known that malignant gliomas arise from a number of well-characterized genetic alterations and activations of oncogenes and inactivation of tumor suppressor genes. These genetic alterations disrupt critical cell cycle, growth factor activation, apoptotic, cell motility, and invasion pathways that lead to phenotypic changes and neoplastic transformation. Research in each of these fields has uncovered potential therapeutic targets that look promising for disease control. Gliomas can now be modeled with fidelity and reproducibility using several transgenic and knockout strategies. Transgenic mouse models are facilitating the testing of various therapeutic strategies *in vivo*. Finally, the recognition of the putative brain tumor stem cell, the tumor initiating cell in brain cancer, provides an enticing target through which we could eliminate the source of the brain tumor with increased efficacy and less toxicity to normal tissues. In this review, we provide an up-to-date discussion of the many of key technologies and tools that are being used in molecular biology to advance our understanding of the biological behavior of human malignant gliomas.

Key words: Oncogene; Tumor suppressor gene; Growth factor; Cell cycle; Apoptosis; Angiogenesis; Invasion; Stem cell.

### Introduction

Human malignant gliomas are among the most malignant and difficult tumors to treat in medicine. The most malignant glioma is the Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM), which despite conventional therapies such as surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy, has a median survival rate of 12 months (1). Uncontrolled cellular proliferation, deregulation of apoptosis, tumor cell-invasion, and angiogenesis are among the biologic processes that render these tumors both aggressive and resistant to treatment. Since the advent of new techniques in molecular biology, many of these cellular processes in the context of malignant gliomas are becoming better understood.

If one considers that Watson and Crick first described the structure of DNA in 1953, the advances that have taken place in molecular biology and medical genetics have been nothing short of meteoric. Some of these advances include: The discovery of techniques facilitating gene transfer in 1973; the application of restriction endonucleases to the cutting of large DNA fragments in 1978; the introduction of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in 1983 facilitating the am-

plification of minute quantities of nucleic acids; the discovery of tumor suppressor genes in 1986 as a family of genes that protects the host from neoplastic transformation of its normal cellular constituents; the development of transgenic and knock-out mouse models for the study of human disease including cancer in the 1990's; and most recently, the application of cDNA microarrays and associated techniques in oncogenomics which serve as gene discovery strategies for diseases such as malignant gliomas.

One of the best examples of the utility of molecular biology techniques in human brain tumors is in anaplastic oligodendroglial tumors, where tumors with losses of chromosomes 1p and 19q are more likely to respond to chemotherapy than those that do not (2). In many centers, loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analysis is becoming part of the standard pathology report for oligodendrogliomas. The subsequent decade will certainly see the integration of several molecular techniques into the standard care of patients with central nervous system (CNS) tumors. In the near future, it is conceivable that each histopathologic category of glioma will be further subdivided into subcategories according to shared genetic markers, gene expression profiles, and similarity of biologic responses to radiation therapy or chemotherapy (3).

In this review, we will provide a state-of-the-art summary of the following topics: Molecular genetics, animal models of human glioma, cell cycle regulation, cell signaling pathways, cell motility and invasion, angiogenesis, and stem cells. We can now argue cogently that if we had a clear understanding of these areas of tumor biology, we could possibly devise novel strategies with which these tumors could be more effectively treated than is presently feasible.

### Molecular Genetic Alterations in Human Gliomas

Cytogenetic and molecular genetic studies on human gliomas published in the last two decades have focused on the diffuse infiltrating gliomas, in particular the GBM. These studies have characterized the various chromosomes and genes that are frequently altered in glial tumors. Tables I and II (4-17) presents a summary of glioma associated proto-oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes while Table III (18-25) shows the genetic changes in familial syndromes, respectively.

### Animal Models of Glioma

The implantation of small tumor spheroids or neurospheres prepared from cell lines or tumor biopsy fragments into the brains of immuno-deficient animals has been one of the earliest models used to study human gliomas (26). In the last two decades, our increasing knowledge of the molecular pathogenesis of gliomas has led to the identification of oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes that can be used to genetically engineer animal models of gliomas (27). These models enable us to study the functional role(s) and interactions of these identified molecular aberrations, including those with the tumor microenvironment to regulate growth-promoting processes, such as angiogenesis and invasion. Moreover, these models serve as pre-clinical vehicles to test new treatments that look promising for human gliomas before they are used in clinical trials (28, 29).

Anomalous stimulation of the Ras proto-oncogene has been previously used in both somatic and germline transgenesis to yield astrocytoma mouse models. Loss of both copies of the NF-1 gene, a negative controller of Ras (Ras-GAP), using glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-regulated Cre-recombinase excision specifically in astrocytes, lead to development of optic gliomas (30). Other molecular alterations found in human gliomas that have been modeled in animals include the mutant epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFRs), platelet-derived growth factors receptors (PDGFRs), and cell cycle regulators (31). A recent example was the functional role of IL-6 in gliomagenesis investigated by breeding IL-6 deficient mice to GFAP-src mice. Ablation of IL-6 prevented astrocytoma formation, but did not affect pre-neoplastic astrogliosis (32). These results, plus activation of STAT-3 (the major signal transducer in IL-6 signaling) in a grade-dependent mode in the GFAP-src astrocytomas, suggest a functional role for IL-6 in the development and malignant progression of astrocytomas. Longitudinal and sequential imaging of these *in vivo* models using MRI, and bioluminescence allows for visualization of tumor growth and response to therapy without having to sacrifice the animal (33-36).

#### Cell Cycle Dysregulation in Human Gliomas

Genetic analyses of primary human brain tumors have revealed common mutations in genes encoding proteins critical for cell cycle regulation. Such observations indicate the importance of tight control of the cell cycle in maintaining normal cellular cycling and appropriate quiescence.

Mutations in the retinoblastoma protein (*Rb*) have been identified in 20% of high grade astrocytic tumors (grade III by WHO classification) (37). While this number may appear low, tumors lacking mutations in *Rb* itself contain mutations in other molecules directly involved in Rb signaling such as the cell cycle inhibitor p16INK4A or CDK4. Interestingly, mice engineered to be deficient for *Rb* alone do not develop brain tumors. Rather, multiple genetic hits including *Rb* are needed to cause a glioma. The loss of RB represents one of several hits that are required in this process. Nonetheless, therapeutic strategies have been designed that target the Rb pathway. Oncolytic adenoviruses that specifically attack cancer cells deficient for Rb have been used to target astro-

cytoma cells (38-40). While mutations in the transcription factor E2F1 have not been detected in human tumors, it has been shown in the laboratory that E2F1 overexpression can induce glioma cell death (41, 42). In addition, adenoviral delivery of E2F1 to glioma cells in vitro enhanced their sensitivity to chemotherapy (43, 44).

Studies have shown that 60-80% of high-grade astrocytic tumors contain homozygous deletion, mutation, or promoter hypermethylation of the INK4A/ARF locus (Figure 1). In addition, 25% of anaplastic oligodendrogliomas have hypermethylation of the INK4A/ARF locus (45). Elimination of this important G1/S brake is believed to directly contribute to progression from grade II to grade III astrocytoma. Many mouse models support this theory: whereas INK4A/ARF-null mice do not develop brain tumors, INK4A/ARF-null background mice engineered to express an oncogenic variant of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) or K-Ras, a mitogenic factor, are predisposed to gliomagenesis (46, 47). Despite conformational and functional similarities to p16INK4A, mutations in p15INK4B have not been detected in primary brain tumors. However, in vitro data suggests that enhanced expression of p15INK4B effectively inhibits glioma cell growth (48).

![Figure 1](https://i.imgur.com/1234567.png)

**Figure 1:** The RB tumor suppressor protein serves as a brake on cell cycle progression. Homozygous deletion, mutation, or promoter hypermethylation of the INK4A/ARF locus results in the inability of this cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor to inactivate CDK4/6. The release of CDK4/6 leads to the phosphorylation of RB by the CDK4/6-cyclinD1 complex. This then results in the release of the E2F transcription factors that can promote cell cycle progression and cell proliferation by transactivating downstream target genes. Interference with this pathway has been considered one approach to bring control to dysregulated cell cycle pathways in human gliomas.

## Glioma Cell Signaling Pathways

Many mitogens and their specific membrane receptors are present in overactive forms in gliomas. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) and receptor (EGFR), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-A and -B and their respective receptors (PDGFR-Î±, -Î²), transforming growth factor (TGF)-Î± acting through the EGFR, and insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I and its receptor (IGFR) are often involved in autocrine or paracrine stimulation of tumor cells (49-54). In gliomas, many of the above ligands are over-expressed due to gene amplification, and receptors can exist in constitutively active mutant forms (55-58). The cognate receptors contain tyrosine kinase activity regulating several intracellular signaling cascades: PI3K/AKT-PKB (phosphoinositide 3-kinase/AKT-protein kinase B) pathway, RAS/MAPK (mitogen activated protein kinase) pathway, and the PLC-Î³/PKC (phospholipase C-Î³/protein kinase C) pathway as examples (Figure 2).

These signaling pathways induce biological responses such as cell proliferation and differentiation, anti-apoptosis, migration and metabolism (59). Factors that regulate intracellular signaling, such as the lipid phosphatase/tensin homolog (PTEN) protein, can also be involved in tumorigenesis. PTEN normally acts as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting the PI3K/AKT-activated signaling cascade (60,61,62,63), so loss of PTEN leads to overactive, unregulated AKT/PKB signaling that promotes cell proliferation and inhibits apoptosis(61,64). AKT also interacts with cyclin D1 and MDM2 (murine double minute 2), and affects regulation of cell cycle control (65,66)(Figure 2).

![Figure 2](https://i.imgur.com/7654321.png)

**Figure 2:** Glioma signaling pathway. Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are activated in gliomas by epidermal growth factor (EGF), transforming growth factor (TGF)-Î±, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-A and -B, and insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1. These RTKs can then signal through Ras-/MAPK (Ras/mitogen activated protein kinase), PLCÎ³-PKC (phospholipase C-Î³/protein kinase C), and PI3K-AKT/PKB (phosphoinositide 3-kinase/AKT-protein kinase B) pathways. The tyrosine phosphatase/tensin homolog (PTEN) protein acts as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting the PI3K/AKT-activated signaling cascade. Ras and PI3K engage the cell cycle machinery through interaction with different regulators that include cyclin D1, MDM2, and p27, which promote cell proliferation, differentiation, anti-apoptosis, migration, and metabolism.

## Molecular Biology of Glioma Invasion

Infiltrative features have long been recognized as a histopathological characteristic of gliomas within the CNS. For glioma cells to invade regions of normal brain, they must be able to migrate and then degrade the surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM).

Glioma cell migration is a complex, composite molecular process, comprised of the alteration of tumor cell adhesion

**Technology in Cancer Research & Treatment, Volume 5, Number 3, June 2006**

to a modified extra-cellular matrix, the secretion of proteases by the cells, and then modifications to the actin cytoskeleton (67). The intracellular mechanisms of astrocytoma migration require a balance of environmental signals and receptive intracellular processes that lead to dynamic regulation of the interactions between actin microfilaments, microtubules, and intermediate filaments (68, 69). The driving force for cell movement, however, is normally provided by dynamic reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, directing protrusion at the front of the cell and retraction at the rear (69-71).

The biological characteristics of cell migration and invasion include adhesion to extra-cellular matrix (ECM), mechanisms to initiate locomotion, and the ability to create a space to move into. Therefore, invasion of the glioma cell into the adjacent normal brain tissue is dependent on the interaction of glioma cells with the extra-cellular matrix and the consequent digestion of matrix barriers. For dissemination into the healthy brain tissue various enzymes are essential, which degrade proteins of the ECM (72).

The ECM plays an important role in cancer progression. Various native ECM proteins like fibronectin; laminin, collagen, vitronectin, and tenascin are found in the peri-vascular spaces of the brain, which are used by glioma cells for invasion. Various studies report the impact of ECM on glioma cell migration. Fibronectin, collagen, vitronectin, and tenascin appear to stimulate glioma cell migration in vitro (73).

Recently it has been shown that normal brain cells can produce laminin, when confronted by invading glioma cells. Laminin stimulates cell migration of several human glioma cell lines in vitro. Adding blocking monoclonal antibodies against the most expressed integrin can inhibit this laminin-stimulated cell migration (74).

Tenascin, an ECM component protein, is found in higher concentration around hyperplastic vessels in gliomas (75, 76), and has been found over-expressed in invasive gliomas in vivo (77). Secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC), a candidate gene recently identified for invasion in gliomas (78). Although the precise mechanism is unclear, transfection of glioma cell lines with SPARC leads to increased invasiveness in vitro assays (79).

Integrins are an important group of adhesion molecules. They are trans-membrane glycoproteins, and 20 various integrins have been identified to date (80). Integrins can interact with a variety of ECM proteins and cell surface molecules, and can trigger signal transduction (80). Integrin binding to the different ECM proteins is directly related to the malignant behavior of gliomas. In fact, neutralizing antibodies to these integrins has been shown to slow glioma migration in vitro (81, 82).

Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a subgroup of proteolytic enzymes that degrade ECM proteins generating space for glioma cell invasion. Various studies have shown that MMPs are over-expressed in glioma cells in comparison to normal brain. Several MMP inhibitors have down regulated glioma invasion, in vitro (80, 83).

Focal adhesion kinase (FAK), a proline-rich non-receptor tyrosine kinase, promotes cell migration in vitro and in vivo (84). It has been found that migration arrested glioma cells have lower levels of phosphorylated FAK, and that FAK expression correlates with invasiveness in various tumor types (85, 86). Recently, it was shown that FAK-inhibition in human glioma cells leads to reduced invasion in vitro. FAK expression also correlates with tumor recurrence (87) and over-expression has been demonstrated in invasive glioma cells (88).

### Angiogenesis

It has long been accepted that tumors are dependant on angiogenesis, the directional sprouting of new blood vessels from existing vessels within the tumor (89). During embryogenesis, the normal physiologic creation of new vasculature is termed vasculogenesis, whereas the budding of capillaries from existing blood vessels is called angiogenesis (90). Tumors must secrete diffusible chemicals that stimulate endothelial cells via a paracrine effect and leads

![Diagram](https://example.com/image.png)

**Figure 3:** Angiogenesis: Tumor cells secrete diffusible angiogenic factors that stimulate differentiation and proliferation of endothelial cells from their progenitors to form a primitive vascular plexus. These factors include fibroblast growth factor (FGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), platelet derived growth factor (PDGF), transforming growth factor (TGF), angiopoietin, proliferin, angiogenin, metalloproteinase (MMP) inhibitors, interleukin (IL)-8, and tumor necrosis factor (TGF)-Î±. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), inducible nitric oxide synthetase (iNOS), and VEGF promoters have also been recognized to regulate angiogenesis in gliomas. Various angiogenic inhibitors including Interferon (INF)-Î±, thalidomide, thrombospondin, interleukin (IL)-12, angiostatin, and endostatin have been identified that hold promise for glioma therapy.

to sprouting of capillaries. The endothelial cells are the principal cell type contributes to angiogenesis. A number of angiogenic factors are now recognized (90, 91). Some of them include: fibroblast growth factor (FGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), platelet derived growth factor (PDGF), transforming growth factor (TGF), Proliferin, Angiogenin, Metalloproteinase inhibitors, interleukin 8, and tumor necrosis factor-Î± (91) (Figure 3).

Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and inducible nitric oxide synthetase (iNOS) has been shown to modify VEGF production and hence regulate angiogenesis (92). An increase in COX-2, iNOS, and VEGF expression has been described in the transition from low-grade to high-grade gliomas.

In addition, the EGFR, Ras, and PI-3 kinase signaling pathways have all been recognized as inducers of the VEGF promoter. It has also been documented that angiopoietin expression and activation increases with glioma grade (93). In these and other studies, the process of angiogenesis has been quantified by measuring microvessel density in tumor specimen (94). In gliomas, microvessel count was found as an independent predictor of prognosis. Microvessel density has also been correlated with the concentration of FGF in brain tumors (95, 96).

Various angiogenic inhibitors have been identified that hold promise for glioma therapy. Some of these include: Interferon Î±, thalidomide, thrombospondin, interleukin 12, glioma derived angiogenesis inhibitory factor, angiostatin, and endostatin. Several angiogenic inhibitors, including thalidomide, CC-5103 and PTK 787/ZK 222584, are currently being investigated in clinical trials (97).

### Glioma Stem Cells

It is now known that there are both neural stem cells and glial progenitor cells in multiple regions of the adult brain. Neural stem cells have been isolated from the subventricular zone (SVZ) (98), the lining of the lateral ventricles, the dentate gyrus (99), within the hippocampus, and the sub-cortical white matter (100, 101). The SVZ contains a population of astrocytes that can function as neural stem cells (98). These, neural stem cells are governed by the same cellular pathways that are active in most of the brain tumors (101). Therefore, they are capable of displaying behavior that is typical of gliomas, including high motility, angiogenesis, invasion of white matter tracts, and activation of signaling pathways (102-104). Accordingly, the SVZ has been proposed as a site-specific origin of human gliomas (105, 106). In support of this, many gliomas are either periventricular or contiguous with the SVZ, and frequently express the progenitor-cell marker nestin (107-111). In animal models, the SVZ, which has a high degree

of cellular proliferation, is more sensitive to chemical or viral oncogenesis than are areas with a low proportion of proliferating cells (112-114).

Recently, a population of brain tumor stem cells has been isolated from human GBMs. After stereotactic injection into the brains of mice, these cells form tumors that bear a striking morphological resemblance to the original human tumor (115). NSC migration can be stimulated by various growth factors, similar to glioma cell migration *in vitro* (116). For example, stimulation of EGFR promotes the growth of both astrocyte precursors (117, 118) and neural stem cells (119, 120). The identification of a brain tumor stem cell provides a rational new target for treating gliomas. In this paradigm, it is of extreme importance to specifically treat the glioma stem cell because this cell has the propensity to self-initiate and self-propagate. Failure to do so will lead to recurrence of the tumor. Although the more differentiated cells within the tumor can be treated with conventional chemotherapeutics or radiation therapy, because these tumor stem cells appear to be the tumor-initiating component of GBM, therapies need to be targeted at this population as well in order to eradicate the tumor (Figure 4).

![Diagram](https://example.com/image.png)

**Figure 4:** Targeting the brain tumor stem cell (BTSC) has important implications for future therapy. Drugs that target the main tumor mass but neglect to kill the brain tumor stem cell will fail because the surviving stem cells will have an opportunity to regrow and expand clonally. However, if drugs selectively target the specific properties of stem cells, then conventional chemotherapy can be used to eradicate the residual tumor mass.

## Novel Molecular Targets for Glioma Therapy

From the above information, it is apparent that new therapeutic strategies for gliomas need to take into consideration the unique molecular abnormalities on which growth of gliomas depend. Accordingly, receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and other signaling pathways represent attractive targets for glioma therapy.

# Molecular Biology of Glioma

As one example, molecular inhibitors of the cell cycle regulator, MDM2, have been newly developed for clinical use. These compounds, called ânutlins,â act by interfering with the interaction between MDM2 and p53, releasing p53 from negative regulation and allowing transcription of cell cycle inhibitory molecules (121). Because *MDM2* is the second most commonly amplified gene in GBM, use of nutlins in this disease may be a rational therapeutic strategy.

Other molecules that hold promise if targeted appropriately and in the right context include: EGFR, especially its ligand-independent variant EGFRvIII; PDGFR on the cell surface; downstream members including RAS/MAPK and PI3K/Akt; TP53; VEGF; and MMPs. In a recent report patients treated with EGFR inhibitors (Erlotinib or Gefitinib) have shown some clinical responsiveness (122).

Recently, it was shown that silencing of the MGMT (O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase) gene by promoter methylation predicted for which patients would respond to the alkylating chemotherapeutic agent, temozolomide, when used in conjunction with radiation therapy after surgery (122-124).

Reduced tumor cell invasion, tumor growth and angiogenesis was seen after inhibition of cathepsin B and MMP-9 gene expression in glioblastoma cell line via RNA interference (125). Combination of âdirectâ angiogenesis inhibitor (endostatin) with an âindirectâ antiangiogenic compound [SU5416, a vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2), receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitor] also resulted in enhanced antiangiogenic and antitumor effects (126).

## Conclusion

In the last decade, there have been numerous advances in the field of molecular diagnosis for patients with malignant gliomas. In the not too distant future, we predict that every patient with GBM will be evaluated for the molecular genetic signature that encodes the signaling pathways and receptors that have gone awry in their individual tumors. We also predict that novel pharmacotherapeutics will be offered and specified according to the genetic lesions that their tumors contain. From this, it may be ascertained that not all patients with GBM will receive the same therapeutic agents. It stands to reason, therefore, that GBM will likely be classified into several different tumor subtypes based on molecular diagnostics. These subtypes of GBM will then be responsive to a special class of inhibitor or antagonist. We have reviewed many of the exciting new areas in which there is hope for drug-design therapy. It will be very interesting to re-write this chapter a decade hence.
