### Abstract

The properties of the N-glycan processing glycosidases located in the endoplasmic reticulum of *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* are described. α-Glucosidase I encoded by *CWH41* cleaves the terminal α1,2-linked glucose and α-glucosidase II encoded by *ROT2* removes the two α1,3-linked glucose residues from the Glc₃Man₉GlcNAc₂ oligosaccharide precursor while the α1,2-mannosidase encoded by *MNS1* removes one specific mannose to form a single isomer of Man₈GlcNAc₂. Although trimming by these glycosidases is not essential for the formation of N-glycan outer chains, recent studies on mutants lacking these enzymes indicate that α-glucosidases I and II play an indirect role in cell wall β1,6-glucan formation and that the α1,2-mannosidase is involved in endoplasmic reticulum quality control. Detailed structure-function studies of recombinant yeast α1,2-mannosidase are described that serve as a model for other members of this enzyme family that has been conserved through eukaryotic evolution. © 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

# 1. Introduction

This review is focused on the structure and function of the glycosidases that are involved in N-linked oligosaccharide processing in *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*. The initial stages of N-glycan processing in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum are remarkably similar in most eukaryotes. For this reason, the yeast processing glycosidases will be compared with those of other eukaryotes, particularly those of mammalian species.

Processing of the N-linked oligosaccharides begins immediately following the transfer of the Glc₃Man₉GlcNAc₂ oligosaccharide precursor from its dolichol-bound form to nascent proteins. As seen in Fig. 1, the terminal α1,2-linked glucose is first removed by α-glucosidase I and then the two α1,3-linked glucose residues are cleaved by α-glucosidase II while α-mannosidase(s) remove some of the mannose residues. Trimming of the glucose residues is identical in *S. cerevisiae* and in mammalian cells, but a different number of mannose residues may be cleaved depending on the organism. In *S. cerevisiae* only one specific α1,2-linked mannose is removed in the ER with the formation of a single Man₈GlcNAc₂ isomer (isomer B), as shown in Fig. 1. In mammalian cells, however, different Man₈GlcNAc₂ isomers can also be formed and additional α1,2-mannose residues may be removed in the ER and in the Golgi. Following the removal of glucose and mannose residues, Golgi glycosyltransferases add different sugars in a species- and cell-specific manner. In *S. cerevisiae* additional mannose residues are added by Golgi α1,6-, α1,2- and α1,3-mannosyltransferases to form mature high mannose oligosaccharide cores of up to 13 mannose, and large mannans containing outer chains attached to the core structure (for reviews see [1–3]). In mammalian cells a variety of glycosyltransferases add different sugars, other than mannose, to form complex and hybrid N-glycans. Comprehensive reviews of the N-glycan processing pathway in eukaryotes have been published [2–7].

# 2. Processing α-glucosidases

The existence of specific processing α-glucosidases in *S. cerevisiae* first became apparent with the observation that a crude commercial yeast α-glucosidase released glucose from Glc₃Man₉GlcNAc₂ [8], but this enzyme activity was absent in more highly purified commercial preparations enriched in activity toward p-nitrophenyl-α-d-mannopyranoside or maltose, indicating that the oligosaccharide was cleaved by more specific enzymes. α-Glucosidase I [9] and α-glucosidase II [10] were then partially purified from yeast extracts and shown to be specific for the removal of the terminal α1,2-linked glucose and of the two α1,3-linked glucose residues, respectively.

During these studies on yeast processing α-glucosidases it was discovered that the glucose analog 1-deoxynojirimycin is a potent inhibitor of yeast and mammalian processing α-glucosidases and that this type of compound can be used to block N-glycan maturation in vivo [10]. This original observation on the yeast processing enzymes led to the use of 1-deoxynojirimycin and related compounds in a wide variety of biological systems and contributed to the demonstration of the importance of N-glycan trimming in glycoprotein folding and function (for reviews see [11–13]). Furthermore, 1-deoxynojirimycin and its derivatives were shown to act as antiviral and antimetastatic agents [14–18].

## 2.1. α-Glucosidase I

α-Glucosidase I was obtained in two forms from a membrane preparation of *S. cerevisiae*. One form was membrane-associated and its activity was stimulated by Triton X-100, whereas the other form was

soluble without detergent [9]. The solubilized enzyme was subsequently purified to homogeneity by sequential ion exchange chromatography and affinity chromatography on concanavalin A and N-5-carboxypentyl-l-deoxynojirimycin [19]. The purified enzyme was shown to be a glycoprotein of 95 kDa on SDS-PAGE. The yeast α-glucosidase I has a pH optimum of 6.8 and no divalent cation requirement. It does not utilize p-nitrophenyl-α-D-glucopyranoside or Glc₁₋₂Man₉GlcNAc₂ as substrates. However, it can be assayed spectrophotometrically using the synthetic trisaccharide, Glc₃-O(CH₂)₈-COOCH₃ [20]. It is inhibited by l-deoxynojirimycin and its derivatives, by kojibiose and by Tris [9, 10, 19]. The yeast α-glucosidase I is less sensitive (Kᵢ = 20 μM) than the calf liver enzyme (Kᵢ = 1 μM) to l-deoxynojirimycin [9, 10, 19]. l-Deoxynojirimycin and castanospermine, another glucosidase inhibitor, have recently been shown to block glucose trimming in vivo, but this inhibition was incomplete even at the relatively high concentration of 5 mM castanospermine [21]. Unlike its mammalian counterpart [22], α-glucosidase I from *S. cerevisiae* is not inhibited by removal of mannose residues from the α1,6-branch of Glc₃Man₉GlcNAc₂ [10].

A mutant of *S. cerevisiae* named *gls1* was isolated during studies of mannoproteins in yeast secretory mutants. This mutant was shown to lack α-glucosidase I, but not α-glucosidase II, activity [23]. The *gls1* mutant exhibits normal growth, sporulation, and mating, but invertase and CPY isolated from the *gls1sec18* double mutant was shown to be larger on SDS-PAGE than invertase and CPY obtained from the *sec18* single mutant. This size difference was eliminated by treatment with endo-H, indicating that the core of these glycoproteins is slightly larger than normal in *gls1* cells, but this modification had little effect on the formation of invertase outer chains. High resolution proton NMR of the N-glycans isolated from *mnn2sec18gls1* cells confirmed that the core oligosaccharides had retained the three glucose residues and that the presence of glucose did not prevent outer chain formation or the addition of α1,3-Man to the core oligosaccharides [24]. It was reported recently [21] that inhibition of glucosidase I by castanospermine in *kar2* strains caused a severe growth defect that was also observed in a *gls1kar2* double mutant. Furthermore, it was found that the

cell wall β1,6-glucan content was reduced in *gls1* cells, and that this reduction was much more pronounced in the *gls1kar2* double mutant.

The *cwh41* mutant was isolated as part of a screen for calcofluor white hypersensitivity [25]. This mutant is partially resistant to K1 killer toxin and has a reduced glucose content in its cell wall. The *CWH41* gene¹ (chromosome VII) was cloned by functional complementation and shown to encode a type II transmembrane protein of 107 kDa by SDS-PAGE [26]. Disruption of the *CWH41* gene causes hypersensitivity to calcofluor white, increased resistance to K1 killer toxin and a 50% reduction in cell wall β1,6-glucan content, but no change in cell wall β1,3-glucan. Cwh41p is a resident integral membrane protein of the endoplasmic reticulum containing a single *N*-glycan core of about 2 kDa. It was observed that the amino acid sequence of Cwh41p has significant similarity to human α-glucosidase I [27] and both in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that *CWH41* encodes the yeast α-glucosidase I [21, 28]. The size of the cloned Cwh41p indicates that the yeast α-glucosidase I preparations studied previously [9, 19] were proteolytically generated soluble forms of the enzyme. Cwh41p is a member of family 63 of the SwissProt classification of glycosyl hydrolases, a classification that reflects common structural features based on amino acid sequence similarities [29].

### 2.2. α-Glucosidase II

α-Glucosidase II was more easily solubilized from yeast membrane preparations than α-glucosidase I in the absence of detergent. It was separated from α-glucosidase I and from non-specific α-glucosidase acting on p-nitrophenyl-α-D-mannopyranoside by ion-exchange chromatography and shown to remove the glucose residues from Glc₁Man₉GlcNAc₂ and Glc₂Man₉GlcNAc₂ but not from Glc₃Man₉GlcNAc₂ [10]. The partially purified enzyme has a broad pH optimum of 5.8–6.8, does not require divalent cation for activity, but it is inhibited by Tris, high phosphatase, and EDTA.

¹ *CWH41* and *ROT2* are the names of the genes encoding α-glucosidase I, α-glucosidase II, respectively, but they have also been called *GLSI* and *GLS2* in the literature. However, according to the Yeast Protein Data Base, the *GLSI* and *GLS2* genes both encode components of β1,3-glucan synthase.

phosphate concentrations and the disaccharides, nigerose and maltose. Yeast α-glucosidase II is more sensitive to inhibition by 1-deoxynojirimycin (IC₅₀ = 2 μM) than yeast α-glucosidase I (IC₅₀ = 20 μM). α-Glucosidase II from *S. cerevisiae*, like its mammalian counterpart [22], is greatly inhibited by removal of mannose residues from the α1,6-branch of Glc₁₋₂-Man₉GlcNAc₂ [10].

Although purified α-glucosidase II has been obtained from other sources, the endogenous yeast enzyme has not been purified to homogeneity. However, the yeast gene *ROT2* (see [1]) (chromosome II) encoding α-glucosidase II has recently been identified in the database by homology with its mammalian counterpart [30]. The yeast gene encodes a hydrophilic protein of 104 kDa with a putative signal sequence, no apparent transmembrane domain or known ER retention/retrieval signal. The amino acid sequence has regions of similarity with family 31 of the SwissProt classification of glycosyl hydrolases. Its disruption eliminates α-glucosidase II activity, but has no effect on growth [30]. However, disruption of the α-glucosidase II gene has an effect on cell wall properties and causes a decrease in cell wall β1,6-glucans similar to that observed for the α-glucosidase I disrupted strains [21,31].

### 3. Role of trimming by glucosidases in β1,6-glucan synthesis

The properties of the cell wall in the glucosidase mutants are altered with a decreased β1,6-glucan content, indicating that α-glucosidase I and II activities are somehow important for normal β1,6-glucan biosynthesis and/or for β1,6-glucan insertion into the cell wall [21,26,31,32]. This function of the α-glucosidases in maintaining normal levels of cell wall β1,6-glucans is not presently understood and several hypotheses have been proposed [21,28,31,32].

One possibility is that specific glycoprotein(s) essential for β1,6-glucan synthesis are not functional due to lack of glucose trimming. It is known that in mammalian cells the folding, stability and transport of some, but not necessarily all, glycoproteins can be greatly affected by retention of the glucose residues on their oligosaccharides. In yeast the maturation of N-linked oligosaccharides on the majority

of glycoproteins is not affected in the glucosidase mutants [21,23], in marked contrast to the inhibition of complex *N*-glycan biosynthesis observed in the absence of α-glucosidase activity in mammalian cells [10,11]. However, the possibility still remains that the function of some specific yeast glycoprotein(s) essential to cell wall β1,6-glucan formation are affected by lack of glucose trimming. In fact, evidence supporting this hypothesis has recently been obtained [32]. It was shown that the level of Kre6p, a protein essential for β1,6-glucan synthesis, is greatly reduced in the *cwh41* strain lacking glucosidase I and that the resulting calcofluor white phenotype could be alleviated by overexpression of Kre6p [32]. It will be of interest to determine whether the lack of glucose trimming also affects function of other proteins essential for β1,6-glucan synthesis.

Another hypothesis that has been proposed is based on a structural model in which β1,6-glucans are directly linked to mannose residues on the α1,3-branch of the *N*-linked glycans [31]. It was suggested that inhibition of glucose trimming from this branch would prevent this putative β1,6-glucan attachment by steric hindrance. Direct demonstration of this mode of linkage between β1,6-glucans and mannose residues of the *N*-glycan core will be required to support this hypothesis.

A third hypothesis, that has been ruled out, suggested a possible direct involvement of the glucosidases in β1,6-glucan synthesis. However, it has been clearly shown that the function of the glucosidases is restricted to trimming of glucosylated oligosaccharides since the decrease in β1,6-glucan observed in the glucosidase mutants can be completely eliminated in mutant strains that do not glucosylate the *N*-linked oligosaccharide precursor [31,32]. The observations that mutations in the glucosidases combined with mutations in either Bip/Kar2p or Cnep have synergistic effects on β1,6-glucan synthesis [21,31] suggest that the glucosidases may be implicated in proper folding of specific glycoproteins required for normal β1,6-glucan synthesis.

### 4. Processing α1,2-mannosidase

The existence of a highly specific processing α-mannosidase in *S. cerevisiae* was first described by

pulse-labeling experiments in vivo showing that isomer B of Man₈GlcNAc₂ (Fig. 1) is the smallest high mannose oligosaccharide formed [33]. It was suggested that removal of the specific mannose residue induces a conformational change in the oligosaccharide that is required for outer chain synthesis [33]. However, it was later demonstrated that the kinetic properties of the α1,6-mannosyltransferase that initiates outer chain synthesis are identical with Man₉GlcNAc and Man₈GlcNAc as substrates [34] and that the removal of mannose is not required for outer chain synthesis in vivo [35]. In fact, structural analysis of N-glycans in *S. cerevisiae* suggested the presence of a minor pathway in which there is no mannose trimming [36].

The highly specific yeast processing α-mannosidase was purified to homogeneity, first as a 60 kDa soluble proteolytically released form [37] and then as the 67 kDa membrane form solubilized by the zwitterionic detergent CHAPS [38]. The enzyme was shown to form the Man₈GlcNAc₂ isomer B by high resolution proton NMR of the product oligosaccharide [39]. It is a glycoprotein and treatment with endo-H causes a decrease in size of about 4 kDa. Both soluble and membrane forms of the enzyme yield two bands of about 44 and 22 kDa on SDS-PAGE observed only under reducing conditions due to a proteolytic clip occurring during isolation and storage.

The purified enzyme does not require the addition of divalent cation for activity, but it is inhibited by Tris, EDTA, Mn²⁺, Co²⁺, Zn²⁺, and Mg²⁺. The inhibition caused by EDTA can be completely reversed by Ca²⁺ and partially by Mg²⁺. The yeast processing α-mannosidase does not utilize aryl α-D-mannopyranoside or Manα1,2-Manα1-OCH₃ as substrates, but it can utilize synthetic Man₃-O(CH₂)₈-COOCH₃ and Man₅-O(CH₂)₈-COOCH₃ with a much lower affinity than for its natural oligosaccharide substrate [40]. The yeast processing α-mannosidase is inhibited by 1-deoxymannojirimycin (IC₅₀ = 50 μM) [39] and even more so by kifunensine (IC₅₀ = 0.1 μM). The yeast enzyme is less sensitive to inhibition by 1-deoxymannojirimycin than the mammalian Golgi α-mannosidases (IC₅₀ = 1–10 μM) [6].

The MNS1 gene (chromosome X) encoding the specific processing α-mannosidase was cloned using amino acid sequence information obtained from the

purified enzyme to design degenerate oligosaccharides for PCR on yeast genomic DNA [41]. The MNS1 gene encodes a type II transmembrane protein of 63 kDa with no significant cytoplasmic tail. Its membrane topology was established by protease protection experiments following in vitro translation of the transcribed gene in a reticulocyte lysate supplemented with dog pancreas microsomes [42]. Its catalytic domain facing the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum contains three N-glycosylation sites which are normally glycosylated, but this glycosylation is not essential for enzymatic activity (F. Lipari, A. Herscovics, unpublished data).

The role of the α-mannosidase was studied by examining the effects of disruption of the MNS1 gene on the glycosylation of total proteins, and of immunoprecipitated invertase and CPY [35]. Fractionation of endo-H-sensitive oligosaccharides by gel filtration and HPLC following labeling with [2-³H]mannose showed that outer chain synthesis occurs in Δmns1 cells even though Man₈GlcNAc₂ is not formed. These results demonstrate that Mns1p is the only functional processing α-mannosidase in *S. cerevisiae* in vivo, and that mannose removal is not essential for maturation of N-linked oligosaccharides.

An effect of disruption of the MNS1 gene on the degradation of misfolded glycoproteins has been reported, suggesting that mannose trimming may be involved in ER quality control [43,44]. It was found that a mutant of CPY was very rapidly degraded in control cells but stabilized in Δmns1 cells. The mechanisms responsible for this difference in stability are not understood, but studies of various alg mutants blocked at different stages of N-glycan synthesis indicate that the carbohydrate moiety of glycoproteins, particularly Man₈GlcNAc₂, plays an important role in ER quality control in *S. cerevisiae* [44].

The sequence of the catalytic domain of the yeast α-mannosidase was found to have significant similarity (about 35% identity) to processing α-mannosidases encoded by mammalian cDNAs [41,45,46] demonstrating the existence of an α1,2-mannosidase gene family that has been conserved through eukaryotic evolution. These enzymes (belonging to family 47 of the Swiss-Prot classification of glycosyl hydrolases) were designated class 1 α-mannosidases [6]. The phylogenetic relationship of some of the members of this enzyme family is shown in Fig. 2. Besides

Only sequences that have been shown to encode functional α1,2-mannosidases are shown with their respective accession numbers. There are additional related sequences in GenBank, but they have not yet been shown to encode functional α-mannosidases. Of all the α1,2-mannosidases studied so far, Mns1p from *S. cerevisiae* is the only enzyme that is specific for removal of a single mannose residue. The terminology Man₉ mannosidase has been used to designate X74837 and Y12503, but their sequence indicates that they belong to the mammalian α-mannosidase IA family.**

gi α1,2-mannosidases that are about 65% identical to each other in amino acid sequence have been cloned and called α-mannosidases IA and IB. These mammalian enzymes remove four mannose residues from Man₉GlcNAc to form Man₅GlcNAc [45–51]. However, several studies indicate that there is a mammalian enzyme with the same specificity as the yeast processing α-mannosidase that forms Man₈GlcNAc₂ isomer B in mammalian cells [51–54]. Although an ER α-mannosidase which was initially believed to correspond to the yeast processing α-mannosidase has been described [55], the latter enzyme has sequence similarity to class 2 α-mannosidases and does not have the restricted specificity of the yeast enzyme [56]. Therefore, the mammalian equivalent of the yeast α-mannosidase remains to be cloned.

### 5. Structure-function studies of the yeast processing α-mannosidase

High level expression of the soluble catalytic domain of the yeast processing α-mannosidase has been achieved. The recombinant α-mannosidase has the same properties as the endogenous enzyme [57]. Initially the recombinant enzyme was expressed in *S. cerevisiae* by inserting the catalytic domain downstream of the α-factor promoter and signal peptide in a high-copy vector [57], but much higher yields were obtained using the methylotrophic yeast, *Pichia pastoris* for expression [58]. In this case the catalytic domain was inserted into the pHIL-S1 vector (Invitrogen) downstream of the alcohol oxidase (*AOXI*) promoter and *PHO1* signal sequence. With this expression system about 20–30 mg/l of enzyme is secreted into the medium following induction with methanol. The enzyme is then easily purified by sequential ion-exchange chromatography. The availability of large amounts of recombinant enzyme has made it possible to obtain preliminary X-ray diffraction data [59] and to undertake studies of the structure and enzymatic mechanism of the yeast α-mannosidase.

It was shown by high resolution proton NMR that the yeast α-mannosidase is an inverting glycosidase, i.e. it catalyzes hydrolysis of the glycosidic bond with inversion of the anomeric configuration [60]. A similar mechanism was recently shown for another mem-

ber of the family [51]. This observation indicates that class 1 and class 2 α-mannosidases have different catalytic mechanisms since the latter were found to be retaining glycosidases [61].

### 5.1. Role of cysteine residues

The yeast α-mannosidase contains five cysteine residues in its catalytic domain, three of which are conserved in all known family members. The role of these residues in the structure and function of the enzyme was examined [58]. Using DTNB as sulfhydryl-specific reagent, and NTSB for disulfide quantitation, the yeast α-mannosidase was found to contain one free sulfhydryl and two disulfide bonds. The enzyme is inactivated by incubation with dithiothreitol with first-order kinetics, suggesting that at least one disulfide bond is essential for enzyme activity. Cys<sup>485</sup> was shown to contain the free thiol group by sequencing labeled peptides following alkylation with <sup>3</sup>H]ICH<sub>2</sub>COOH and by HPLC/MS tryptic peptide mapping. The presence of disulfide bonds between Cys<sup>340</sup>-Cys<sup>385</sup> and between Cys<sup>468</sup>-Cys<sup>471</sup> was demonstrated by sequencing purified peptides isolated from cyanogen bromide and protease digests, and by mapping tryptic peptides by HPLC/MS. Mutagenesis of each cysteine residue to serine showed that the disulfide bond between Cys<sup>340</sup>-Cys<sup>385</sup> is essential for production of active recombinant enzyme, whereas none of the other cysteine residues are required for activity. Since the essential disulfide bond is formed between cysteine residues that have been conserved in all known class 1 α-mannosidases, it is likely to be important for the structural integrity of other members of this enzyme family.

### 5.2. Role of putative EF hand motif

The yeast α-mannosidase requires tightly bound Ca<sup>2+</sup> for activity, as do other members of the class 1 α-mannosidases. These enzymes contain a putative Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding site composed of a helix-loop-helix arrangement known as an EF hand [62]. The loop consists of a 12-residue consensus sequence to which Ca<sup>2+</sup> is usually ligated, coordinated to side-chain oxygen-bearing groups at positions X, Y, Z, –X, –Y, –Z. Of the six positions essential for metal ion chelation, X and –Z are usually invariant and are conserved in class 1 α-mannosidases. The importance of these sites in Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding and enzyme activity was investigated by site-directed mutagenesis of the two key positions, X and –Z, and the catalytic domains of the mutated yeast α-mannosidases were expressed in *P. pastoris* and purified. Surprisingly, it was found that the mutants still bound one Ca<sup>2+</sup> per protein molecule as does the wild-type enzyme [63]. It seems therefore that the EF hand is not functional in the yeast α-mannosidase and that Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding occurs elsewhere in the protein.

### 5.3. Role of conserved acidic residues

There are nine conserved acidic residues in the class 1 α-mannosidases, and the importance of these residues was demonstrated by mutagenesis of each of these residues. It was shown by complementation of a mannosidase-deficient *S. cerevisiae* strain that five of the mutants (E214Q, D275N, E279Q, E435Q, E503Q) had no detectable α1,2-mannosidase activity whereas the others (D86N, E132Q, E438Q, E526Q) had very low activity compared to wild-type enzyme [63]. When the mutants were expressed as secreted proteins in *P. pastoris*, two of the mutants, E214Q and E435Q, were poorly secreted. It was demonstrated on non-denaturing SDS-PAGE that D275N, E279Q, and E438Q mutants had no detectable or little <sup>45</sup>Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding, whereas D86N, E132Q, E503Q, and E526Q mutants exhibited similar binding of <sup>45</sup>Ca<sup>2+</sup> as the wild-type enzyme. From kinetic analyses of the other mutants, it was shown that Asp<sup>86</sup>, Glu<sup>132</sup>, and Glu<sup>503</sup> are important for catalysis [63].

### 6. ER localization of yeast processing glycosidases

The yeast processing glycosidases are resident proteins of the endoplasmic reticulum, but they do not have any of the known ER targeting sequences such as HDEL or KK(RR)XX involved in retrieval of soluble and membrane proteins, respectively, from the Golgi to the ER (for review see [64]). How these enzymes are retained in the ER presents a challenging problem in cell biology. It has been suggested that the transmembrane domain of α-glucosidase I determines its ER localization.

tion since replacing the transmembrane domain of  
the plasma membrane enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase  
IV with that of the mammalian α-glucosidase I re-  
sulted in ER retention of the chimeric molecules,  
possibly through oligomer formation [65]. We have  
recently obtained similar evidence implicating the  
transmembrane domain of the yeast α-mannosidase  
as a determinant of its ER localization. It was ob-  
served that replacing the N-terminal region of the  
mammalian processing α-mannosidase IB by the  
yeast transmembrane domain results in ER localiza-  
tion of the chimera following transfection of COS  
cells whereas the intact mammalian enzyme localizes  
to the Golgi [45]. However, in these types of studies  
it is difficult to rule out ER retention caused by mis-  
folding of the chimeric proteins. On the other hand,  
a novel retrieval mechanism involving the transmem-  
brane domain has been implicated in the ER retenti-  
on of Sec12p, another yeast type II ER transmem-  
brane protein [66]. Mutants were selected for ER  
retention defects and their characterization led to  
the identification of the RER1 gene that encodes a  
Golgi membrane protein required for retrieval of  
Sec12p from an early Golgi compartment [67]. This  
Rer1p-mediated retrieval seems to depend upon the  
Sec12p transmembrane domain [68]. Recent observations indicate that a similar transmembrane-dependent  
retrieval may be operating for ER localization of  
the yeast α-mannosidase since we have observed that  
its retention is greatly impaired in rer1 mutant cells  
[69] and that it is found in the vacuoles of rer1pep4  
cells [70]. Furthermore, it was shown with antibodies  
to α1,6-mannose residues that some of the α-mannosidase normally acquires Golgi-specific carbohydrate modifications, indicating that Rer1p-dependent recycling from the Golgi is involved in its ER localization [70].

In the case of α-glucosidase II that also lacks the  
known ER retention/retrieval sequences and has no  
transmembrane domain, it was recently suggested  
that ER localization is mediated by its association  
with another protein [30]. It was found that purified  
rat liver α-glucosidase II consists of two subunits  
that are both essential for enzyme activity [30,71]  
although this concept remains controversial [72]. The 104 kDa α-subunit that is homologous to the  
yeast α-glucosidase II contains the catalytic activity  
whereas the β-subunit was suggested to be important  

for ER localization of α-glucosidase II because it  
contains HDEL at its C-terminus. A yeast sequence  
related to the β-subunit was not found in the database by Trombetta et al. [30]. However, there is a  
sequence with regions of amino acid similarity to  
the β-subunit in the yeast genome database (YDR221W), but it lacks HDEL at its C-terminus. Additional work is required to unravel the molecular mechanisms that determine the ER localization of α-glucosidase II and of the other processing glycosidases.

### 7. Conclusions

It is evident from the work described in this review  
that studies on the processing glycosidases in *S. cerevisiae* contribute to knowledge of *N*-glycan biosynthesis not only in yeast but also in other eukaryotes. In addition, work on the yeast glycosidases is helping to unravel the complex processes required for cell wall formation and in ER quality control implicated in glycoprotein folding. Studies of the recombinant yeast processing α-mannosidase which can be produced in large amounts provide a model for the elucidation of the structure and the enzymatic mechanisms of class I α-mannosidases. Furthermore, the use of yeast mutants to identify genes that are required for ER targeting of the glycosidases will indicate experimental approaches that can be useful to study the molecular interactions involved in ER localization.
