## Summary

Lipoic acid is an essential cofactor of α-keto acid dehydrogenase complexes (KADHCs). This study shows that *Plasmodium falciparum* possesses two distinct lipoylation pathways that are found in separate subcellular localizations. Lipoic acid synthesis comprising lipoic acid synthase and lipoyl-ACP:protein N-lipoyl transferase is present in the parasite’s apicoplast, whereas the second pathway consisting of lipoic acid protein ligase is located in the parasite’s mitochondrion. The two localizations were established by overexpressing green fluorescent protein fusions of the N-terminal sequences of lipoic acid synthase and lipoic acid protein ligase in intraerythrocytic stages of *P. falciparum*. Northern and Western blot analyses revealed that the genes/proteins encoding lipoic acid synthase, lipoyl-ACP:protein N-lipoyl transferase and lipoic acid protein ligase are expressed maximally in the early and late stages of *P. falciparum* erythrocytic development. The functionality of the three proteins was proven by complementation of bacteria deficient in *lipA* and *lipB*. Our results show that *P. falciparum* possesses two independent pathways, with different locations, responsible for the post-translational modification of KADHCs. Both pathways fundamentally differ from those in the human host. As KADHCs provide metabolites that are required for essential biosynthetic processes such as fatty acid biosynthesis and haem biosynthesis, the two lipoylation pathways of *P. falciparum* might be attractive therapeutic targets against malaria.

## Introduction

Lipoic acid (6,8-thioctic acid or 1,2-dithiolane-3-pentanoic acid) is an essential cofactor of the α-keto acid dehydrogenase complexes (KADHCs), pyruvate dehydrogenase, 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase and branched chain α-keto acid dehydrogenase, as well as the glycine decarboxylase complex (Reed and Hackert, 1990; Perham, 2000; Douce et al., 2001). Lipoic acid is ligated to the ε-amino group of a specific lysine residue of the dihydrolipoamide transacylase of the KADHCs and the H protein of the glycine decarboxylase complex (Reche and Perham, 1999; Douce et al., 2001). It is generally believed that mammalian cells rely entirely upon salvage of lipoic acid, which is taken up via vitamin transporters (Prasad et al., 1998; Wang et al., 1999). Lipoic acid thus acquired from the environment is ligated to the transacylase components of KADHCs by two consecutive enzymatic reactions catalysed by the lipoate-activating enzyme and the lipoyl-AMP:Nε-lysine lipoyltransferase (Fujiwara et al., 1999; 2001) (Fig. 1). Bacteria also possess a salvage pathway that uses exogenous lipoate. However, in bacteria, the ligation to the dihydrolipoamide transacylase is catalysed by a single, ATP-dependent enzyme, lipoic acid protein ligase (LplA), which is distinct from the mammalian enzymes (Morris et al., 1995) (Fig. 1). In addition, bacteria and plants synthesize lipoic acid from octanoyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) provided by the fatty acid synthesis pathway (Miller et al., 2000). The two reactions of lipoic acid synthesis are catalysed by lipoate synthase (LipA), an S-adenosyl methionine (AdoMet)-dependent, [Fe-S] cluster-containing enzyme with a high degree of mechanistic similarity to biotin synthase (Miller et al., 2000; Yasuno and Wada, 2002), and LipB, a lipoyl-ACP:protein N-lipoyl transferase that covalently attaches lipoyl-ACP to the transacylase subunit of the dehydrogenase complexes (Jordan and Cronan, 2003) (Fig. 1).

*Plasmodium falciparum* is one of the four *Plasmodium* species that causes human malaria, one of the most devastating tropical diseases that is responsible for 2 million human deaths annually. This problem has been increased by the development of resistance in the parasites against existing antimalarials, and so new, affordable and effective drugs are urgently required to counter the disease. *P. falciparum* possesses an organelle related to a plant chloroplast, the so-called apicoplast (McFadden et al., 1996; Fichera and Roos, 1997). Key metabolic pathways that are located in the apicoplast are type II fatty acid synthesis and non-mevalonate isoprenoid synthesis, both related to the pathways found in plants and bacteria and distinct from

Fig. 1. Enzymes involved in lipoic acid synthesis and salvage pathways. Lipoic acid is synthesized from octanoyl-acyl carrier protein (octanoyl-ACP), a product of fatty acid biosynthesis. The [Fe-S] cluster-containing, S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet)-dependent lipoic acid synthase (LipA) introduces two sulphurs into octanoyl-ACP resulting in the formation of lipoyl-ACP. Lipoyl-ACP is the substrate for lipoyl-ACP:protein N-lipoyl transferase (LipB), which attaches lipoic acid to a specific lysine residue of the dihydrolipoamide transacetylase subunit of KADHCs. This pathway is of significance in plants, fungi and prokaryotes, whereas mammals appear to be entirely dependent on the salvage pathway for their supply of lipoic acid. In mammals, two separate enzymes are responsible for the ligation of exogenously scavenged lipoic acid to the KADHCs (lipoic acid activating enzyme and lipoyl-transferase; shown with broken arrows), whereas in bacteria this reaction is catalysed by a single, ATP-dependent lipoic acid protein ligase (LplA).

those in mammals (Waller et al., 1998; Jomaa et al., 1999). Inhibitors of enzymes involved in these pathways proved to have plasmodicidal activity *in vitro* and *in vivo* (Jomaa et al., 1999; Surolia and Surolia, 2001). These findings emphasize the fact that the metabolic processes present in the apicoplast are essential for parasite survival and therefore offer excellent targets for the development of new parasite-specific therapies against malaria. Fatty acid biosynthesis requires acetyl-CoA as substrate and NADH as reducing cofactor. These metabolites are provided by an apicoplast-localized pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (Gardner et al., 2002; B. J. Foth, L. M. Stimmler and G. I. McFadden, personal communication). In addition, the parasites possess the genes encoding for 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase and branched chain α-keto acid dehydrogenase complexes that are potentially mitochondrial (Gardner et al., 2002; P. J. McMillan and S. Müller, unpublished results). In order to be functional, these KADHCs need to be post-translationally modified by lipoylation (Reche and Perham, 1999). Recently, it was shown that the related apicomplexan parasite *Toxoplasma gondii* possesses an apicoplast-localized LipA, and it was predicted that the gene encoding LipA is also present in *P. falciparum* (Thomsen-Zieger et al., 2003). Further, bioinformatic analyses of the *Plasmodium* genome suggested the presence of two other genes involved in lipoic acid metabolism – *lipB* and *lplA* (Thomsen-Zieger et al., 2003). The studies we report here establish that, in *P. falciparum*, lipoic acid synthesis is located in the parasite’s apicoplast and that the enzyme responsible for lipoic acid salvage is present in the parasite’s mitochondrion. Thus, *P. falciparum* contains two independent pathways that guarantee the lipoylation of their organelle-specific KADHCs.

Results

Cloning and alignments

Genes potentially encoding for the enzymes responsible for lipoate synthesis (lipoic acid synthase, *lipA*) and lipoate ligation (lipoyl-ACP:protein N-lipoyl transferase, *lipB*; and lipoic acid protein ligase, *lplA*) in *P. falciparum* were identified by a TBLASTN search of the *Plasmodium* genome database using PlasmoDB on chromosomes 13 and 8 respectively (The *Plasmodium* Genome Database Collaborative, 2001). The *lipA* gene encodes a polypeptide of 415 amino acids and a theoretical molecular size of 47.6 kDa. The deduced amino acid sequence shows 48.8%, 43.0% and 30.0% identity with the proteins from *T. gondii*, *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* and *Escherichia coli* respectively. Lipoic acid synthase (LipA) belongs to the family of radical SAM proteins (Sofia et al., 2001) including biotin synthase, lysine-2,3-amino mutase and anaerobic ribonucleotide reductase. They all cleave either C–H or C–C bonds via a radical mechanism involving an [Fe-S] cluster and the reductive cleavage of AdoMet (Johnson, 1998; Cosper et al., 2000; Miller et al., 2000; Ollagnier-de Choudens et al., 2000). The proteins share a consensus CysXXXCysXXCys motif that is thought to be the [Fe-S] cluster-binding motif (Külzer et al., 1998; Cheek and Broderick, 2001; Marquet, 2001). Lipoic acid synthase introduces two sulphur atoms into octanoyl-ACP to form lipoyl-ACP (see Fig. 1). This activated form of lipoic acid is subsequently transferred to the ε-amino group of a specific lysine residue of the dihydrolipoamide transacetylase subunit of KADHCs by lipoyl-ACP:protein N-lipoyl transferase or LipB (Fig. 1). An important feature of the *P. falciparum* LipA deduced amino acid sequence is a

72-residue N-terminal extension that is not present in the *E. coli* enzyme. Bioinformatic analyses using SIGNALP and PLASMOAP predicted that the N-terminal portion of the extension is a potential signal peptide. The cleavage site for the signal peptide was predicted to be between amino acids 26 and 27. Using PLASMOAP, the following stretch of hydrophilic amino acids was predicted with high confidence to be an apicoplast transit peptide (Nielsen *et al.*, 1997; Foth *et al.*, 2003). In addition, the protein possesses several potential DnaK binding sites (centred on residues 6–8 and 100–110), which have been suggested to be important for apicoplast targeting (Foth *et al.*, 2003). Thus, *P. falciparum* LipA possesses a typical bipartite apicoplast targeting sequence (Waller *et al.*, 2000).

The *P. falciparum* *lipB* gene encodes a polypeptide of 434 amino acids, with a theoretical molecular mass of 51.6 kDa and 13.6%, 13.1% and 10.0% identity to the proteins of *S. cerevisiae*, *Schizosaccharomyces pombe* and *E. coli* respectively. This low degree of identity is partly due to a long N-terminal extension and the occurrence of several large insertions in the *Plasmodium* protein. Nevertheless, there are boxes of high homology between *Plasmodium* LipB and the amino acid sequences of LipB from bacteria and fungi. These areas might have structural roles or be involved in catalytic activity of the protein. Similar to LipA, the LipB deduced amino acid sequence possesses an N-terminal extension of 84 amino acids when compared with the bacterial LipB amino acid sequence. SIGNALP analysis of the N-terminal part of the protein predicted a signal peptide of 25 amino acids. Similar to LipA, the potential signal peptide is followed by a stretch of hydrophilic amino acids that was predicted to be an apicoplast transit peptide (Nielsen *et al.*, 1997; Foth *et al.*, 2003). As for the LipA deduced amino acid sequence, LipB possesses potential DnaK binding sites around positions 10–16, 26–30 and 40–43. These results suggest that both LipA and LipB are located in the parasite’s apicoplast.

The third gene, *lplA*, was identified on chromosome 13 and encodes for a polypeptide of 408 amino acids with a theoretical molecular mass of 47.9 kDa. The deduced amino acid sequence has a moderate degree of identity to bacterial and fungal lipoic acid protein ligase (27.0% and 22.0% identities with *E. coli* LplA and *S. pombe* LplA respectively), the enzymes that catalyse the ATP-dependent ligation of exogenously scavenged lipoic acid to the dihydrolipoamide transacylase subunit of KADHCs (see Fig. 1). The N-terminal extension of *P. falciparum* LplA is much shorter than those found in LipA and LipB. Bioinformatic analyses using MITOPROT, PLASMiT and TARGETP predicted a potential mitochondrial targeting sequence of 19 amino acids, suggesting that LplA is active in the parasite’s mitochondrion rather than in its apicoplast (Claros and Vincens, 1996; Emanuelsson

Lipoic acid in Plasmodium falciparum 105

et al., 2000; Bender et al., 2003). Thus, it appears that *P. falciparum* possesses genes that encode for proteins that carry out lipoylation in both the mitochondrion and the apicoplast.

*LipA*, *LipB* and *LplA* are expressed in *P. falciparum* erythrocytic stages

To determine whether *lipA*, *lipB* and *lplA* are transcribed during the erythrocytic stages of *P. falciparum*, total RNA from sorbitol synchronized parasites was isolated and analysed by Northern blotting (Fig. 2A). The *lipA* and *lipB* genes were transcribed at highest levels in the ring and schizont stages of the parasites. The *lipA* transcription profile is consistent with that found in the microarray studies performed by Le Roch *et al.* (2003) and Bozdech *et al.* (2003). The microarray data for *lipB* and *lplA* transcription suggest that the genes are expressed at low levels hardly

Fig. 2. Expression of *lipA*, *lipB* and *lplA* during the erythrocytic development of *P. falciparum*.

A. Stage-specific Northern blot analyses were performed of *lipA*, *lipB* and *lplA* according to Experimental procedures. The blot was probed consecutively using *lipA*, *lipB* and *lplA* specific probes followed by the loading control (18S rRNA). R, ring stage; T, trophozoite stage; S, schizont stage. Sizes of RNA standards (Promega) are shown on the right.

detectable in their studies. The low expression was confirmed by our finding that large amounts of RNA and prolonged exposure times were required to obtain appreciable signals of *lipB* and *lplA* mRNA on the Northern blot. Under these conditions, we found that the *lplA* gene was transcribed throughout the erythrocytic stages of the parasites, albeit the signals appear to be stronger in the ring and schizont stages than in the trophozoite stage of the parasites (Fig. 2A).

The transcription patterns that we found for *lipA* and *lplA* are consistent with the expression of both proteins in the erythrocytic stages of the parasites. The proteins were detected at the highest levels during the early and late stages of parasite development (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, LipA existed as a single band of 39 kDa, which corresponds to the predicted size of the mature protein after cleavage of the potential bipartite apicoplast targeting protein (the size of the unprocessed protein is about 48 kDa). In previous studies of other apicoplast targeted proteins, it was found that both the unprocessed and the mature forms of a protein were detectable in Western blot analyses (Waller et al., 2000; van Dooren et al., 2002). As *P. falciparum* LipA is probably not an abundant protein, these differences might simply reflect differences in expression levels. Indeed, in order to obtain detectable signals of LipA protein on the blots, high amounts of protein (20–30 μg) and prolonged exposures (up to 1 h) of the blots were required, whereas for the glutathione reductase loading control, a 30 s exposure of the same blot was sufficient to obtain a signal. The expression pattern of the LplA protein was similar to that of LipA, suggesting that the two proteins, representing different lipoylation pathways, are present in the cell at the same time. As with LipA, only the mature 46 kDa LplA protein was detectable in the

Western blot, possibly reflecting low abundance of the protein. Alternatively, the processing of the mitochondrial targeting sequence might be an instantaneous process so that only the mature form of the protein was detectable on the blot.

### Functionality of LipA, LipB and LplA

In order to test the functionality of the three recombinant proteins, complementation assays using the *E. coli* strains KER 176 (deficient in *lipA*) and KER 184 (deficient in *lipB*) were performed, both on minimal medium agar plates and in minimal liquid medium (Fig. 3). In order functionally to express the three genes in *E. coli*, constructs lacking the potential apicoplast and mitochondrial targeting sequences were generated. As the precise cleavage sites for apicoplast transit peptides are unknown, the start sites of the potentially mature LipA and LipB proteins were determined according to the alignments of the predicted amino acid sequences with those of other organisms. Expression of the truncated constructs of the *P. falciparum* *lipA* gene supported growth of the *lipA*-deficient bacterial strain after induction with anhydrotetracycline, but not if the expression was not induced (Fig. 3B). Similarly, expression of *P. falciparum* *lipB* in the *lipB*-deficient *E. coli* supported growth of the *lipB*-deficient bacteria. LplA functionality was also tested in the *lipB*-deficient bacterial line. When maintained in minimal medium, these bacteria can only grow when either LipB or another lipoic acid protein ligase transfers lipoyl-ACP provided by lipoic acid synthase to the dihydrolipoamide transacylase subunits of KADHCs. LipB of *E. coli* has been shown to be quite specific for ACP-coupled fatty acids, whereas *E. coli* LplA is more promiscuous and also uses lipoyl-ACP (although

**Fig. 3.** Complementation of *lipA-* and *lipB*-deficient *E. coli*.  
A. *E. coli* KER 176 (*lipA* deficient) was transformed with pASK-LipA or pASK-IBA3 (1 and 4), and the bacteria were plated onto M9 minimal agar (see Experimental procedures). *E. coli* KER 184 (*lipB* deficient) were transformed with pASK-LipB, pASK-LplA or pASK-IBA3 (2, 3 and 5 respectively) and also plated onto M9 minimal agar as described in Experimental procedures. Growth was observed after 4 days at 37°C.  
B. Using one colony of the same transformants, liquid M9 media was inoculated, and recombinant expression of LipA, LipB and LplA was either induced with anhydrotetracycline (LipA+, LipB+, LplA+) or bacteria were grown without induction of recombinant protein expression (LipA−, LipB−, LplA−). As negative controls, bacterial strains *E. coli* Ker176 (*lipA* deficient) (176) and Ker184 (*lipB* deficient) (184) were transformed with pASK-IBA3 without an insert. Bacterial growth was monitored for 5 days, and the optical density of the cultures was determined at 600 nm. The figure shows the results from three independent experiments ± standard deviation.
to a lesser extent) when no free lipoic acid is available (Morris *et al.*, 1995; Miller *et al.*, 2000). This appears also to be the case for *P. falciparum* LplA, which complemented growth of the *lipB*-deficient bacteria, suggesting that the parasite’s LplA uses free lipoic acid as well as lipoyl-ACP (Fig. 3).

### Localization LplA and LipA

The localization of *P. falciparum* LipA was investigated by expressing a fusion of the 119 N-terminal amino acids of LipA and green fluorescent protein (GFP) in *P. falciparum* erythrocytic stages. This protein localized to a single organelle within the parasites that was clearly distinct from the mitochondrion (Fig. 4A). In contrast, expression of the N-terminal 113 amino acids of *P. falciparum* LplA fused to GFP resulted in a clear staining of the parasite’s mitochondrion, as shown by co-localization with MitoTracker (Fig. 4B). Thus, the lipoic acid synthesis pathway and the lipoic acid salvage pathway are located in distinct organelles in *P. falciparum*, suggesting that they act independently on their organelle-specific substrates.

### Discussion

We have identified three genes in the *P. falciparum* genome that encode for the enzymes responsible for lipoic acid synthesis and the subsequent ligation to the transacylase subunits of KADHCs, namely lipoic acid synthase (LipA), lipoyl-ACP:protein *N*-lipoyltransferase (LipB) and lipoate protein ligase (LplA). All three proteins are nuclear encoded but possess N-terminal targeting sequences that apparently confer transport into the parasite’s apicoplast (LipA and LipB) and mitochondrion (LplA). The expression of LipA–GFP and LplA–GFP fusion proteins in the erythrocytic stages of *Plasmodium* clearly showed that the N-terminal sequence of LplA leads to transport of GFP into the mitochondrion, whereas the N-terminal sequence of LipA resulted in transit of GFP into an organelle distinct from the mitochondrion and likely to be the apicoplast. These results suggest that *Plasmodium* possess two separate organelle-specific pathways by which they post-translationally lipoylate KADHCs. This correlates well with the distribution of these enzyme complexes in *P. falciparum*. The parasite contains KADHCs in both its mitochondrion and its apicoplast (Gardner *et al.*, 2002; B. J. Foth, L. M. Stimmler and G. I. McFadden, personal communication; P. J. McMillan and S. Müller, unpublished). The pyruvate dehydrogenase complex appears to be present only in the apicoplast, whereas the 2-oxoglutarate and branched chain α-keto acid dehydrogenase complexes are located in the mitochondrion. This situation is reminiscent of that in higher plants where mitochondria and chloroplasts both contain functional pyruvate dehy-

drogenase complexes (Mooney *et al.*, 2002). Moreover, both organelles also possess lipoic acid-synthesizing pathways to guarantee lipoylation of the dihydrolipoamide transacylase subunits of their respective KADHCs (Gueguen *et al.*, 2000; Wada *et al.*, 2001; Yasuno and Wada, 2002). In mammals and fungi, the proteins requiring lipoylation are located solely in the mitochondrion and, accordingly, lipoic acid synthesis and lipoylation occur only in this organelle (Sulo and Martin, 1993; Brody *et al.*, 1997; Fujiwara *et al.*, 1999; 2001). *Plasmodium*, however, needs functional KADHCs in both its mitochondrion and its apicoplast; fatty acid biosynthesis in the apicoplast and haem biosynthesis in the mitochondrion are metabolic pathways that require metabolites provided by pyruvate dehydrogenase complex and 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex respectively. Thus, it is imperative that both organelles also possess components that guarantee the efficient post-translational lipoylation of their organelle-specific KADHCs. These results with *P. falciparum* are supported by the finding that LipA in the related apicomplexan parasite *T. gondii* also appears to be located in the apicoplast and that the genes required for lipoic acid ligation are also present in the parasite’s genome and are predicted to localize to apicoplast and mitochondrion (Thomsen-Zieger *et al.*, 2003).

The functionality of the *P. falciparum* proteins was demonstrated by complementing the growth defect of *lipA-* and *lipB*-deficient *E. coli* strains with expression constructs of *P. falciparum* LipA, LipB and LplA. Interestingly, expression of *P. falciparum* LplA also complemented the growth defect of the *lipB*-deficient *E. coli* strain, suggesting that the protein not only uses free lipoic acid but can also use lipoyl-ACP as a substrate similar to the *E. coli* protein (Morris *et al.*, 1995).

In order to analyse the expression pattern of *lipA*, *lipB* and *lplA* during the erythrocytic development of *Plasmodium*, stage-specific Northern and Western blot analyses were performed. *LipA* mRNA and protein levels were apparently highest in the early and late stages of the intraerythrocytic parasites, which is fully consistent with the microarray analyses performed by Le Roch *et al.* (2003) and Bozdech *et al.* (2003). Interestingly, the microarray data suggest that the mRNA levels of *lipB* and *lplA* are low during the erythrocytic cycle of the parasites, which is consistent with our findings. This is not altogether surprising as lipoic acid is considered as a vitamin, and vitamins are generally only required at trace amounts in order to ensure metabolic functions. Indeed, lipoic acid in *P. falciparum* is probably only necessary for the post-translational modification of the dihydrolipoamide transacylases of the three KADHCs and the H protein of the glycine decarboxylase complex. The microarray data available (Le Roch *et al.*, 2003) suggest, for instance, that the transcriptional levels of the components of the pyru-

Fig. 4. Localization of LipA–GFP fusion and LplA–GFP fusion constructs overexpressed in *P. falciparum*.

A. The first N-terminal 339 nucleotides of the *lipA* gene were cloned in frame with green fluorescent protein (GFP) in order to analyse the functionality of the predicted bipartite targeting peptide. The peptide confers transit of GFP into an organelle distinct from the mitochondrion as shown by co-staining the parasites with MitoTracker CMX Ros. The parasites were analysed by fluorescent light microscopy as described in Experimental procedures. The figure shows four different developmental stages of intraerythrocytic *P. falciparum*, which demonstrate the morphological changes of the apicoplast throughout the erythrocytic cycle of the parasites as has been shown previously by Waller *et al.* (2000). Phase: *P. falciparum* phase-contrast image of a trophozoite. LipA–GFP: image taken of LipA–GFP fusion protein using the GFP channel.

B. The first N-terminal 357 nucleotides of the *lplA* gene were cloned in frame with GFP in order to analyse whether the predicted mitochondrial targeting sequence confers transit of GFP into the parasite’s mitochondrion. The LplA–GFP-transfected parasites were treated with MitoTracker CMX Ros as described in Experimental procedures and were subsequently analysed by fluorescent light microscopy. The co-localization of GFP and MitoTracker fluorescence suggests that the LplA N-terminal extension represents mitochondrial targeting sequence.

vate dehydrogenase complex are low throughout the erythrocytic cycle of the parasites, which is in agreement with a low requirement of lipoyl-ACP provided by the lipoic acid synthetic pathway. In addition, there is no information available about the stability of the dihydrolipoamide transacetylase in *Plasmodium*. It might be possible that the protein, once translated and modified, is relatively stable and that further lipoylation is not required unless new transacetylase protein is synthesized. Moreover, it is feasible to suggest that the synthesis of fatty acids required for membrane biogenesis is higher during the early and late stages of intraerythrocytic parasite development and that there is an upregulation of pyruvate dehydrogenase and lipoic acid synthesis at these times

to guarantee a sufficient supply of acetyl-CoA (Roberts *et al.*, 2003).

According to our data, the lipoylation pathways in the apicoplast and mitochondrion appear to be active in the parasites at the same time. This is clearly different from the situation in *E. coli* where lipoic acid synthesis is suppressed as long as exogenous lipoic acid is provided and LplA is active (Morris *et al.*, 1995). As both pathways exist in the same compartment in *E. coli*, it is reasonable that their lipoylation pathways are regulated in this way. However, the compartmentalization of the *Plasmodium* lipoylation pathways suggests that lipoic acid synthesis and lipoic acid salvage most probably function independently. Possibly, the apicoplast is entirely dependent on the endogenous lipoic acid synthesis and is unable to take up and use exogenous lipoic acid from the host. In agreement with this, the only source for lipoyl-ACP in *P. falciparum* is fatty acid biosynthesis, which occurs exclusively in the apicoplast of the parasite. This suggestion is also supported by the substrate specificity of LipB, which solely catalyses the ligation of ACP-coupled fatty acids, provided by LipA, to the transacylases of KADHCs (Jordan and Cronan, 2003). In contrast, it appears that the mitochondrion must have a transport system that facilitates uptake of lipoic acid because the organelle does not contain the lipoic acid synthetic machinery as it is found in plants and fungi (Sulo and Martin, 1993). The uptake of lipoic acid from the environment into *Plasmodium*-infected erythrocytes has not been shown yet, but the presence of a pantothenate transporter that might also be responsible for lipoic acid uptake has been reported (Saliba and Kirk, 2001). Another possibility is that lipoyl-ACP synthesized in the parasite’s apicoplast is translocated into the mitochondrion either directly as the two organelles appear to be closely associated (Bannister *et al.*, 2000) or indirectly via the cytosol. This would render the parasites entirely independent from the host organism for the supply of this important cofactor. Indeed, the fact that *P. falciparum* LplA when expressed in *E. coli* also uses lipoyl-ACP as a substrate might support this suggestion.

Our results provide evidence that *Plasmodium* possesses two separate pathways that confer lipoylation of KADHCs in distinct cellular compartments. Lipoic acid is a crucial cofactor for the apicoplast pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, the enzyme that provides essential metabolites for fatty acid biosynthesis that was shown to be vital for parasite survival (Surolia and Surolia, 2001). Therefore, it is probable that apicoplast lipoic acid synthesis is an indispensable pathway for parasite survival and thus itself a potential target for drug design against malaria. The mitochondrial lipoylation pathway, which might use lipoic acid acquired from the host or provided by the synthetic pathway located in the apicoplast, differs fundamentally from the pathway of mammals, and so it is feasible

that specific inhibition of the parasite pathway, which is also likely to be essential, may be achievable.

### Experimental procedures

#### Materials

pASK-IBA3 was from IBA. The *lipA* (KER 176) and *lipB* (KER 184)-deficient bacterial strains were a kind gift from Dr John Cronan, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, USA (Reed and Cronan, 1993; Morris *et al.*, 1995). Professor Alan F. Cowman and Dr Tim W. Gilberger (The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute for Medical Research, Melbourne, Australia) kindly provided the transfection plasmids pHH2 (Waller *et al.*, 2000) and pARL<sup>+</sup>. [α-<sup>32</sup>P]-ATP (6000 Ci mmol<sup>−1</sup>) and the ECL<sup>+</sup> Western blot detection system were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Albumax II and RPMI 1640 were from Invitrogen. WR 99210 was a kind gift from Dr Jacobus, Jacobus Pharmaceuticals, USA. Antibodies against recombinant proteins were raised in a rabbit (LipA) and a rat (LplA) by Eurogentec.

#### Parasites and culture conditions

*Plasmodium falciparum* 3D7 (The Netherlands) were cultivated according to the method of Trager and Jensen (1976) with modifications in human A<sup>+</sup> erythrocytes, RPMI 1640 containing 10 mM glucose, with the addition of 0.1% Albumax II. Parasites were synchronized using 5% sorbitol according to the method of Lambros and Vanderberg (1979) and harvested 14 ± 6 h (rings), 28 ± 6 h (trophozoites) and 38 ± 6 h (schizonts) after infection. In order to isolate total RNA or protein, infected erythrocytes were saponin lysed (Umlas and Fallon, 1971), and the resulting pellets were resuspended in Trizol (Life Technology) or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche) respectively.

#### Database searches and sequence analyses

Three genes apparently encoding for *lipA*, *lipB* and *lplA* were identified in the *Plasmodium* genome database PlasmoDB (http://PlasmoDB.org) (The *Plasmodium* Genome Database Collaborative, 2001) by performing TBLASTN searches using the protein sequences from *E. coli* (accession numbers: LipA, NP_308693; LipB, BAA35273; and LplA, AAC77339). Predicted translations of the sequences identified were queried back against the SWISSPROT protein database at NCBI using BLASTP (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast). Prediction of N-terminal targeting sequences was performed using SIGNALP (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/) (Nielsen *et al.*, 1997), TARGETP (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TargetP) (Emanuelsson *et al.*, 2000), MITOPROT (http://mips.biochem.mpg.de/cgi-bin/proj/medgen/mitofilter) (Claros and Vincens, 1996), PLASMIT (http://gecco.org.chemie.uni-frankfurt.de/plasmit/index.html) (Bender *et al.*, 2003) and PLASMOAP (http://www.PlasmoDB.org/restricted/PlasmoAPcgi.shtml) (Foth *et al.*, 2003). Nucleotide and protein sequence analyses were performed using VECTOR NTI (Informax) and GENERUNNER.

# Cloning of lipA, lipB and lplA

The full-length *lipA*, *lipB* and *lplA* genes of *P. falciparum* were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the sequence-specific sense and antisense oligonucleotides LipA-1 (5′-gcgccatatgaaaaatttgaaaaaaacaagaaacgaacctg-3′), LipA-2 (5′-gcgcctcgagttaattttttatctttgtttcgtttgg-3′), LipB-1 (5′-gcgccatatgaaaattaaaaagagaaaaattctgg-3′), LipB-2 (5′-gcgcctcgagttaataaaacatttctcgatatc-3′), LplA-1 (5′-gcgccatat gaaacgaatattcagg-3′) and LplA-2 (5′-gcgcctcgagctaaagttctg taatatcc-3′) and *P. falciparum* 3D7 genomic or cDNA as templates. The sense oligonucleotides contain *Ndel* sites, and the antisense oligonucleotides contain *Xhol* sites to facilitate directional cloning of the constructs into the expression plasmid pJC40 (Clos and Brandau, 1994), which adds an N-terminal (His)$_{10}$-tag to the recombinant protein allowing purification by Ni$^{2+}$-chelating chromatography. The PCR fragments were cloned into either TOPO Blunt (Invitrogen) or pJC40 previously cut with *Ndel* and *Xhol*, and their nucleotide sequences were determined by automated sequencing on an ABI 377 (Bio-Rad). From full-length constructs, the potential mature coding regions of all three genes were amplified using the sense primers LipA-3 (5′-gcgcgcggttctcgaatgaataaaa ataaaaaggag-3′), LipB-3 (5′-gcgcgcggttctcgaatgaacctaaca catgaaatttg-3′) and LplA-3 (5′-gcgcgcggttctcgaatggaaaaag gacaaatggacctttgg-3′) and the antisense oligonucleotides LipA-4 (5′-gcgcgcggttctcagcgctattttttatctttgtttcgtttgg-3′), LipB-4 (5′-gcgcgcggttctcagcgctataaaacatttctcgatatc-3′) and LplA-4 (5′-gcgcgcggttctcagcgctaagttcttgtaatatccatgaacg-3′). The oligonucleotides contain *Eco31I* restriction sites that permit cloning into the expression plasmid pASK-IBA3, which confers fusion of a C-terminal Strep-tag to the recombinant proteins. Before digesting the amplified fragments with *Eco31I*, the template plasmids were destroyed by a *DpnI* digest. Purified PCR fragments (Qiagen PCR purification kit) were ligated into pASK-IBA3 previously cut with *Eco31I* to yield pASK-LipA, pASK-LipB and pASK-LplA. The nucleotide sequences of all constructs were confirmed by automated sequencing.

## Complementation assays

To confirm that the recombinant proteins were functional and enzymatically active, pASK-LipA was transformed into *E. coli* KER 176, and pASK-LipB and pASK-LplA were transformed into *E. coli* KER 184. The bacteria were plated on M9 minimal agar (Sambrook *et al.*, 1989) containing 0.2% glucose, 1% thiamine, 1 mM MgSO$_4$, 50 μg ml$^{-1}$ kanamycin and ampicillin, respectively, and 200 ng ml$^{-1}$ anhydrotetracycline to induce expression of the recombinant *Plasmodium* proteins. As controls, *E. coli* KER 176 and *E. coli* KER 184 transformed with pASK-IBA3 without an insert were also plated on to the agar. The plates were incubated at 37°C until bacterial growth was observed. In addition, growth complementation experiments in liquid M9 minimal medium containing the same additional nutrients, salts and antibiotics as stated above for the M9 minimal agar (Sambrook *et al.*, 1989) were performed using *E. coli* KER176 and *E. coli* KER 184 transformed with the respective expression plasmids. Bacteria were grown in either the presence or the absence of 200 ng ml$^{-1}$ anhydrotetracycline. In control experiments, bacteria transformed with pASK-IBA3 not containing an insert were monitored.

## Expression of LipA, LipB and LplA in P. falciparum erythrocytic stages

Polyclonal antibodies raised against *P. falciparum* LipA (rabbit) and LplA (rat) were used to detect both proteins in a soluble extract of stage-specific parasites in the ring, trophozoite and schizont stages. Soluble proteins (20–30 μg per lane) were separated on a 12% SDS-PAGE (Novagen) and subsequently blotted on to nitrocellulose (Schleicher and Schüll). The blot was probed with primary rabbit anti-LipA antibodies at 1:60 and primary rat anti-LplA antibodies at 1:150 using standard protocols (Sambrook *et al.*, 1989). The secondary anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated (Scottish Antibody Production Unit) or anti-rat HRP-conjugated (DaKo) antibodies were used at 1:10000 and 1:5000 respectively. After extensive washing, the blots were developed using the ECL$^+$ system (Amersham). In order to obtain visible signals, the blots had to be exposed for at least 30 min. The blots were reprobed with a polyclonal anti-glutathione reductase rabbit antibody in order to control for equal loading. In this case, blots never had to be exposed for longer than 1 min to detect the signal. In order to analyse the levels of transcription of all three genes during the parasites’ erythrocytic life stages, total RNA from synchronized *P. falciparum* was isolated by the Trizol method according to the manufacturer’s recommendation (Life Technology). Northern blot analysis was performed as described by Kyes *et al.* (2000). Total RNA (30 μg) for each parasite stage was separated on a 1.5% agarose gel containing 5 mM guanidine thiocyanate. Subsequently, the RNA was blotted on to positively charged nylon membranes overnight before hybridizing the blots with radiolabelled probes of *lipA*, *lipB* and *lplA* coding regions using standard procedures (Sambrook *et al.*, 1989). After washing the blots twice in 1× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 15 min, they were exposed to Hyperfilm (Amersham) for at least 1–2 weeks to obtain detectable signals. The blots were reprobed with a probe specific for the 18S rRNA as a loading control, and the films were exposed for not longer than 1 h to prevent overexposure.

## Localization of LplA and LipA

Analyses of *lplA*, *lipA* and *lipB* deduced amino acid sequences revealed a potential mitochondrial targeting sequence and bipartite apicoplast targeting sequences, respectively, at their N-termini. For localization studies, the first 339 nucleotides of the *lplA* coding region and the first 357 nucleotides of the *lipA* coding region were amplified using oligonucleotides LplA-5 (5′-gcgcgaattcagatctaa aatggcgatgaaaacgaatattcaggtttgg3′) and LplA-6 (5′-gcgccctag gtaagtcgatgataaacggcacctc-3′) and LipA-5 (5′-gcgcgaattcag actaaaaatggcgatgattttggtatcccactccc-3′) and LipA-6 (5′-gcgc- cctaggaggcattttatttccaactttttggtg-3′) from genomic *P. falciparum* DNA. The sense oligonucleotides contain a *BgII* restriction site, and the antisense oligonucleotides have an *AvrII* restriction site to allow subcloning into the *P. falciparum*

transfection plasmid pHH2 (Waller *et al.*, 2000). For cloning into pARL⁺ (A. F. Cowman and T. W. Gilberger, personal communication), oligonucleotides LipA-7 (5′-gcgccctcgagatg cattttggtatcccattcc-3′) and LipA-8 (5′-gcgcggtaaccttaaggacgtc agacctg-3′) or LplA-7 (5′-gcgccctcgagatg aaacgaatattcagg tgg-3′) and LplA-8 (5′-gcgcggtaaccttaag gacgtccagacctg-3′), respectively, were used to amplify the GFP fusion constructs from the respective LipA or LplA-pHH2 constructs. The PCR fragments were cloned into the Xhol- and Kpnl-restricted pARL⁺. The nucleotide sequences were confirmed by automated sequencing before the plasmids were used to transfect *P. falciparum* erythrocytic stages according to the method of Deitsch *et al.* (2001). Briefly, erythrocytes were resuspended to 50% haematocrit, washed with incomplete cytomix (Wu *et al.*, 1995), and 450 μl was combined with 80–100 μg of circular plasmid DNA to make up 500 μl total volume. The cells were electroporated using a Bio-Rad gene pulser II at 0.31 kV and 960 μF. They were subsequently washed with culture media, diluted to 5% haematocrit and inoculated with parasites to a final parasitaemia of 1%. Parasites were grown for 48 h without drug selection before the medium was supplemented with 5 nM WR99210 to select for transfectants. First parasites were observed after 90 days of selection when using pHH2 and after 15 days of selection when using pARL⁺ as transfection plasmids.

**Microscopy**

Live parasites were observed by fluorescent microscopy using an Axiovert 200M microscope (Zeiss) equipped with an Axiocam HRC digital camera (Zeiss). In order to visualize the mitochondrion, parasites were incubated with MitoTracker Red CMX Ros according to the manufacturer’s recommendation (Molecular Probes). Briefly, parasitized erythrocytes were incubated with 25 nM MitoTracker for 3–5 min at 37°C before a 10-fold excess of prewarmed culture medium was added, and the cells were pelleted at 1500 r.p.m. for 5 min at room temperature. The supernatant was removed, and the parasitized cells were resuspended in prewarmed medium and immediately analysed by fluorescent microscopy.
