**Abstract:** The emergence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) and problems with the BCG tuberculosis vaccine to protect humans against TB have prompted investigations into alternative approaches to combat this disease by exploring novel bacterial drug targets and vaccines. Phosphatidylinositol mannosides (PIMs) are biologically important glycoconjugates and represent common essential precursors of more complex mycobacterial cell wall glycolipids including lipomannan (LM), lipoarabinomannan (LAM), and mannan capped lipoarabinomannan (ManLAM). Synthetic PIMs constitute important biochemical tools to elucidate the biosynthesis of this class of molecules, to reveal PIM interactions with host cells, and to investigate the function of PIMs as potential antigens and/or adjuvants for vaccine development. Here, we report the efficient synthesis of all PIMs including phosphatidylinositol (PI) and phosphatidylinositol mono- to hexa-mannoside (PIM₁ to PIM₆). Robust synthetic protocols were developed for utilizing bicyclic and tricyclic orthoesters as well as mannosyl phosphates as glycosylating agents. Each synthetic PIM was equipped with a thiol-linker for immobilization on surfaces and carrier proteins for biological and immunological studies. The synthetic PIMs were immobilized on microarray slides to elucidate differences in binding to the dendritic cell specific intercellular adhesion molecule-grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN) receptor. Synthetic PIMs served as immune stimulators during immunization experiments in C57BL/6 mice when coupled to the model antigen keyhole-limpet hemocyanin (KLH).

## Introduction

Tuberculosis (TB) is a complex disease and a major cause of mortality worldwide.$^{1-3}$ Despite the development of new treatments, TB remains a global health concern.$^{4,5}$ Annually, there are more than seven million new cases and two million deaths caused by TB.$^{6}$ Coinfection with HIV leads to an exacerbation of the disease$^{4}$ and contributes to higher mortality in HIV patients.$^{6,7}$ Programs to combat TB in many countries have failed to eradicate TB,$^{8}$ partly due to the spread of multidrug-resistant TB$^{9}$ and the low efficacy of the BCG vaccine. Therefore, the exploration of novel drug targets and vaccines against *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* (*Mtb*), the main causative pathogen of TB, is essential.

Among pathogenic bacteria, *Mtb* causes more deaths in humans than any other pathogen.$^{6,10,11}$ Approximately one-third of the world population has already been infected by *Mtb.*$^{4}$ *Mtb* is an intracellular pathogen that has evolved to persist efficiently in infected macrophages.$^{4,8,12}$ The composition of the *Mtb* cell wall is important for the interaction with host cells during the initial steps of the infection. Later, cell wall components play a crucial role in modulating the pro-inflammatory response by macrophages and also serve as a protective barrier to prevent antituberculosis agents from permeating inside. Consequently, the antibiotics used for the treatment of tuberculosis require long-term administration.$^{5}$ Mortality in people living in developing countries is high since their access to these antibiotics is often limited and compliance with treatment courses is low.

The major components of the mycobacterial cell wall are the mycolyl arabinogalactan-peptidoglycan (mAGP) complex and interspersed glycolipids including ManLAM, LAM, LM, and

of PIMs was emphasized by the finding that PIMs bind to receptors on both phagocytic ${ }^{17,24,25}$ and nonphagocytic ${ }^{12}$ mammalian cells. Recently, it has been shown that PIMs, but neither LAM nor ManLAM interact with the VLA-5 on CD4 ${ }^{+}$ T lymphocytes and induce the activation of this integrin. ${ }^{22}$ These findings suggest that PIMs are not only secreted to the extracellular environment, but also exposed on the surface of $M t b$ to interact with host cells.

Although different functions have been ascribed to the PIMs, it remains to be determined whether and to which extent the different PIM substructures display biological activity. A better understanding of the mycobacterial cell wall biosynthesis is required to be able to counteract with the problems of drug resistance and bacterial persistence. Synthetic PIMs represent important biochemical tools to elucidate biosynthetic pathways and to reveal interactions with receptors on host cells. PIMs are potential vaccine antigens and/or adjuvants.

Several synthetic PIMs containing fewer mannoside units have been synthesized employing various chemical methodologies. ${ }^{26-33}$ In contrast to PIM $_{3}$ and PIM $_{4}$ that contain only $\alpha-1,6$ mannosidic linkages, PIM $_{5}$ and PIM $_{6}$ also incorporate $\alpha-1,2$ mannosides that might contribute to different biological activities of these PIMs. None of the studies to date utilized synthetic PIMs that contain linkers for immobilization. Coupling of synthetic PIMs to carrier proteins, beads, quantum dots, microarray or surface plasmon resonance (SPR) surfaces opens a host of options for biochemical studies. Here, we report the efficient synthesis of the carbohydrate portion of all PIMs including phosphatidylinositol (PI) and PIM $_{1}$ to PIM $_{6}$ (Figure 2). The native diacylglycerol phosphate at the C-1 position of $m y o$-inositol is replaced by a 6-thiohexyl phosphate residue for immobilization of the synthetic PIMs on surfaces.

## Results and Discussion

### Retrosynthetic Analysis

The overall structure of the synthetic PIM targets (Figure 2) can be attained by the convergent union of oligomannosides with D-$m y o$-inositol containing pseudosaccharides and a thiol-terminated phosphate linker (Scheme 1). Late-stage couplings between protected oligosaccharide fragments (1–4) and 8 allow for parallel syntheses of the intermediates for all target molecules. The key glycosylations in these syntheses are the couplings between mannose phosphate 1, oligomannosyl trichloroacetimidates (2–4) and the common

Syntheses of Monosaccharide Building Blocks. Mannosyl building blocks 1, 5, and 10 were synthesized from mannose bicyclic and tricyclic orthoesters (6, 12, Scheme 2).${}^{34,35}$ Starting from D-mannose, mannosyl phosphate 1 was accessed in six steps by dibutyl phosphoric acid opening of the bicyclic orthoester 7. Mannosyl tricyclic orthoester 6 is readily available from D-mannose over six high yielding steps. ${}^{35}$ This process required only one purification at the last step and gave 6 in 70% overall yield. The versatile intermediate 6 was opened by allyl alcohol upon activation with BF$_3$·Et$_2$O to afford 5 in excellent yield. Treatment of orthoester 6 with dibutyl phosphate selectively opened the tricyclic orthoester to furnish glycosyl phosphate 13, leaving the C-6 hydroxyl group unprotected. The installation of a triisopropylsilyl (TIPS) group was straightforward and furnished building block 10.

The previously reported synthetic route to the differentially protected $\mathbf{myo}$-inositol by Fraser-Reid et al. ${}^{36}$ was modified (Scheme 3). Methyl glucopyranose was quantitatively converted to 15 in three consecutive steps. A Parikh-Doering reaction oxidized the primary hydroxyl group in 15 to an aldehyde in quantitative yield. Using this oxidation, we avoided complications arising from the urea byproduct created when dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) was used as activator. The sulfate byproduct was readily removed by water extraction. The partially protected $\mathbf{myo}$-inositol 16 was prepared from 15 in 40% yield over four consecutive steps. The allyl and NAP protecting groups were introduced at C1 and C2 of the D-$\mathbf{myo}$-inositol respectively as previously described ${}^{37}$ to furnish 11, ready for further decoration at the C6 hydroxyl group.

Assembly of $\mathbf{myo}$-Inositol Containing Pseudosaccharides. The $\mathbf{myo}$-inositol containing pseudotrisaccharide 8 was assembled in a stepwise manner. Glycosylation of inositol 11 with mannosyl phosphate 10 that contained a C6-TIPS ether as a temporary protecting group was found to be optimal at $-40$ °C, in toluene, and promoted by a stoichiometric amount of TMSOTf (Scheme 4). Under these conditions the reaction gave a good yield with complete $\alpha$-selectivity. To sustain further glycosylations, the temporary TIPS protecting group was replaced by the levulinyl (Lev) group. The presence of TIPS rather than Lev on the C6 hydroxyl group of 10 was found necessary to balance its reactivity with inositol 10 to obtain high yield and selectivity, as observed in a previous study. ${}^{37}$ Treatment of 19 with DDQ unmasked the C2 hydroxyl group on inositol to give 20 that served in turn as nucleophile during the next mannosylation.

The second mannosylation on the C2 hydroxyl group of pseudodisaccharide 20 was found to be nontrivial (Table 1). Activation by TMSOTf afforded the desired pseudodisaccharide 21 in just 15% yield (Table 1, Entry 1). Decomposition of 1 to form the anomeric alcohol was observed instead. Switching the promoter from TMSOTf to the milder activator TBDMSOTf dramatically improved the yield of the desired product (Table 1, Entry 2). This observation suggested a possible reactivity mismatch between highly activated 1 and less activated 20. The glycosylation was thus improved by reducing the reactivity of 1 with TBDMSOTf. The activity of the less reactive 20 was increased by higher reaction temperatures. Product 21 was

Chemical Synthesis of All PIM Glycans

obtained in excellent yield (95%) and selectivity by performing the glycosylation at 0 °C (Table 1, Entry 5). The α linkages in 21 were confirmed by 2D NMR. \({ }^{1} \mathrm{H}-{ }^{13} \mathrm{C}\) coupled HSQC NMR indicated \({ }^{1} \mathrm{H}{ }_{\mathrm{C}}-{ }^{13} \mathrm{C}_{1}\) coupling constants \(\left(J_{\mathrm{C}_{1}, \mathrm{H}_{1}}\right)\) of 178 Hz at the anomic position of the mannose connected to the C2 of inositol and 182 Hz at the anomic position of the mannose on C6 of inositol. \(J_{\mathrm{C}_{1}, \mathrm{H}_{1}}\) of β mannosidic linkages are typically lower at around 159 Hz. \({ }^{38}\)

Removal of the Lev group in 21 was achieved by treatment with hydrazine acetate in methanol and required careful monitoring. Longer reaction times resulted predominantly in the reduction of the allyl moiety to a propyl group. Partially protected inositol 16 was subjected to protecting group manipulations to furnish the inositol intermediates for PI and PIM₁ (Scheme 5). Based on reactivity differences, the equatorial C6 hydroxyl group of the diol 22 was selectively acetylated to afford 23 as the intermediate en route to PIM₁. The PI intermediate 24 was obtained in parallel by benzylation of the common intermediate 22.

Assembly of Oligomannoside Fragments. The oligomannoside trichloroacetimidates 2, 3, and 4 were assembled in linear fashion (Scheme 6). All glycosylations employed mannosyl phosphate 1 and TMSOTf as activator. The α-1,6 glycosidic bond was readily formed at 0 °C in quantitative yield. A lower temperature (-40 °C) was required to efficiently install 1,2 glycosylic linkages with complete α-selectivity. Deallylation of 25–27 was performed by allylic substitutions mediated by a palladium complex to yield the corresponding anomic alcohols 28–30. Finally, conversion to the glycosyl trichloroacetimidates 2–4 was carried out using sodium hydride as base.

Assembly of Protected PIM Backbones. Prior to phosphorylation, all protected PIM oligosaccharide backbones were obtained by late-state glycosylations (Table 2). Following these glycosylations all ester protecting groups were removed with sodium methoxide in methanol at elevated temperature before masking the free hydroxyl groups as benzyl ethers. These protecting group manipulations were performed to avoid the persistence of \(O\)-benzoate protecting groups under Birch conditions in the final deprotection. \({ }^{39}\)

Coupling between mannosyl phosphate 1 and inositol 23 gave pseudodisaccharide 31, the backbone of PIM₁. To access the PIM₂ backbone, pseudotrisaccharide fragment 8 was directly used as the starting material to be transformed into backbone 32. The glycosylation products from couplings (Table 2, entry 3–5) between the oligomannosyl trichloroacetimidates (1–3) and the common pseudotrisaccharide 8 were cleanly achieved

at -10 °C. After quenching with triethylamine, the concentrated crude products were directly converted to obtain the benzylated products. When the larger structure 4 was used for glycosylation, the coupling became more sluggish and resulted in the hydrolysis of 4. A higher temperature (0 °C) was needed to obtain the 4 + 3 glycosylation product 46 (see Experimental Section). Pseudoheptasaccharide 46 was the largest oligosaccharide assembled in this series and consisted of fragments of all smaller oligosaccharides. Thus, 46 was analyzed extensively by C-H coupled HSQC to confirm its structural identity. 2D-NMR data elucidated six anomic proton signals with typical \({ }^{38} \alpha\)-manno \(J_{\mathrm{C}_{1}, \mathrm{H}_{1}}\) couplings.

Removal of \(O\)-Allyl Protecting Group on Inositol. Protocols to cleave the C-1 \(O\)-allyl group on inositol attached to oligosaccharides, performed by using \(\mathrm{PdCl}_{2}\), have been reported to give moderate yields. \({ }^{32,40-43}\) This literature precedence was reflected in our study as well. Different methods to remove the \(O\)-allyl group were explored on substrate 31 (Scheme 7 and Table 3). The hydrogen activated iridium complex Ir{(COD)[PH₃(C₆H₅)₂]₂}PF₆ was found to be the most efficient reagent to isomerize the allyl group to the corresponding enol ether. In the same pot, a catalytic amount of \(p\)-toluenesulfonic acid (\(p\)-TsOH) was added to cleave the enol ether and liberate the Cl hydroxyl of pseudodisaccharide 38 in quantitative yield. This two-step procedure was applied to the larger oligosaccharides 32 to 36 as well. However, while the isomerizations mediated by the iridium complex worked smoothly, an excess of \(p\)-TsOH (10 equiv) was required to cleave the enol ether and furnish 39–43 (Scheme 7, entry 3).

Phosphorylation and Global Deprotection. The phosphate moiety accompanied by a terminal thiol linker was installed on the inositol C1 hydroxyl group of the oligosaccharide backbone 37–43 using a H-phosphonate (Scheme 8). Substrates 37–43 were treated with pivaloyl chloride in the presence of linker 44 and pyridine. Subsequently, in the same pot, the H-phosphonate diesters were oxidized with iodine and water to provide the fully benzylated phosphodiesters 45 as triethylamine salts in excellent yield. Global removal of benzyl protecting groups of analogs 45a–g was achieved under Birch reduction conditions. The fully protected compounds were treated with sodium dissolved in ammonia to furnish the final products PI and PIM₁–PIM₆ (Figure 2). Small amounts of incompletely reduced products were observed containing some remaining benzyl groups. These side products were separated by extraction with chloroform and converted to the final products by resubmission to Birch reduction. The final products were formed as a mixture of monomers and disulfide dimers. Treatment with one equivalent of tris(carboxyethyl) phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP) immediately prior to conjugation of the final compounds ensured that PI and PIM₁–PIM₆ were present as monomers.

PIM Microarrays to Determine Binding to DC-SIGN. To study the interactions of synthetic PI and PIMs with the protein DC-SIGN on a microarray, PI and PIMs were immobilized on a maleimide activated glass slide via their thiol handle following established protocols (Figure 3). \({ }^{44}\) DC-SIGN is an important receptor on dendritic cells and contributes to the initiation of a pro-inflammatory response by host cells. \({ }^{45-47}\) One of the functions of DC-SIGN is the recognition of evolutionary

Glass slides printed with the immobilized PI and PIM₁–PIM₆ were incubated with a DC-SIGN solution in buffer at room temperature to allow DC-SIGN to bind to the immobilized PIMs. Excess DC-SIGN was washed off and bound DC-SIGN was detected by incubation with a fluorescein-conjugated anti-DC-SIGN antibody. The difference in DC-SIGN binding affinity to the synthetic PIM compounds was assessed semiquantitatively by monitoring the fluorescence intensity via a fluorescence scanner (for fluorescence intensity data, see Supporting Information). Synthetic PIMs bind to DC-SIGN in a specific manner (Figure 3). Although both synthetic analogs of the most abundant PIM₂ and PIM₆ are recognized by DC-SIGN, the larger synthetic oligosaccharides PIM₅ and PIM₆ bound to DC-SIGN to a greater extent. This observation underlines the significance of the α-1,2-mannose motif present in both PIMs and ManLAM structures. ${}^{53}$

by which PIM structures on Mtb can influence bacterial trafficking in host cells. The synthetic compounds can also be attached to affinity columns in search for proteins or enzymes in cell lysates that interact with PIMs. Moreover, the synthetic PIMs can be used as substrates to explore biosynthetic pathways of the PIMs.

We are investigating the possibility of applying synthetic PIMs as antigens to elicit an immune response against Mtb as well as their adjuvant properties *in vivo*. For these purposes, the synthetic compounds can be conjugated to different model antigens.

**Conclusion**

In this study, the efficient synthesis of all PIMs including phosphatidylinositol (PI) and PIM₁ to PIM₆ was reported. A robust and practical synthesis to the PIM molecules was developed utilizing mannosyl bicyclic and tricyclic orthoesters and mannosyl phosphates. The key intermediate orthoesters allowed for rapid and scalable syntheses of mannoside building blocks and the glycosylations of the mannosyl phosphates resulted in excellent yields and stereoselectivity. All synthetic PIMs are equipped with a thiol linker to be readily immobilized on microarray surfaces. Thus, the synthetic PIMs represent tools for various biological studies. An application of the synthetic PI and PIMs for interaction with the protein DC-SIGN was

demonstrated. The difference in DC-SIGN binding affinity among synthetic PI and PIM compounds was observed in a specific manner. Immunization experiments in mice revealed the potential of synthetic PIMs to serve as immune stimulators.

**Experimental Section**

**Immunization of Mice and Detection of anti-KLH Antibody Levels in Sera.** Preparation of keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) in complete/incomplete Freund’s adjuvant was performed by mixing KLH with Freund’s adjuvant in a 1:1 volume ratio. For coupling of PIM₆ to KLH, PIM₆ was incubated with Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine HCl (TCEP) in equal molar ratio for one hour at rt. A molar excess of PIM₆ was then coupled to KLH using the Inject Maleimide Activated mcKLH Kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL) according to manufacturer’s instructions. PIM₆–KLH conjugate was purified by gel filtration chromatography and the

A PI and PIM immobilized glass slide was incubated with a solution of DC-SIGN ($1 \mu\text{g}/100 \mu\text{L}$) in HEPES buffer containing 1% BSA, 20 mM CaCl₂, and 0.5% Tween-20 at room temperature for 1 h. The slide was washed thoroughly and incubated with a solution of fluorescein conjugated antihuman DC-SIGN antibody ($0.5 \mu\text{g}/100 \mu\text{L}$) in HEPES buffer containing 1% BSA and 0.5% Tween-20 at room temperature for 1 h. The slide was washed thoroughly and scanned by a fluorescent microarray scanner. (PBS = Phosphate-buffered saline, Gal = Galactose)

Figure 4. Immunization studies in mice with the model antigen KLH coupled to PIM₆. On day 0, four C57BL/6 mice per group (6–8 weeks) were s.c. immunized with KLH alone, KLH in complete Freund’s adjuvant, KLH with alum, KLH with CpG or KLH covalently linked to PIM₆. On day 10, mice received a boost immunization with KLH alone, KLH in incomplete Freund’s adjuvant, KLH with alum, KLH with CpG, or KLH-PIM₆. (A) On day 17 post immunization blood was taken from the saphenous vein of the immunized mice and levels of anti-KLH antibodies (sum of IgA, IgG and IgM) were measured by ELISA in serial dilutions of the sera (1:1000, 1:2000, 1:10000, 1:50000, duplicates for each mouse). Data are presented as mean ± SEM for each group of mice. Statistical analysis was performed with Student’s *t* test (*p* < 0.05). (B) On day 20 post immunization, 2 × 10⁵ splenocytes were restimulated with KLH (10 μg/ml) for 24 h and cell proliferation was measured. The results are expressed as a stimulation index (SI) which is the net proliferation of spleen cell cultures stimulated with 10 μg/ml KLH divided by the net proliferation of spleen cell cultures in medium. Data are presented as mean ± SEM for each group of mice. Statistical analysis was performed with Student’s *t* test (*p* < 0.05). The dashed line represents proliferation of spleen cells from unimmunized mice. (C) On day 20, 2 × 10⁵ splenocytes were stimulated with KLH (10 μg/ml) or Concanavalin A (ConA, 10 μg/ml) in a 96-Well plate coated with antimouse-IFN-γ and the frequency of IFN-γ producing cells was determined by ELISpot analysis. The results are expressed as spot forming units (sfu) which is the number of cells producing IFN-γ in each well. Data are presented as mean ± SEM for each group of mice. Statistical analysis was performed with Student’s *t* test (*p* < 0.05). The dashed line represents IFN-γ production of cells cultivated in medium (unspecific background).

17, blood was taken from the saphenous vein and serum was separated from the clotted blood by centrifugation. All animal experiments were in accordance with local Animal Ethics Committee regulations.

Levels of anti-KLH antibodies in sera of immunized mice were measured by ELISA. Briefly, Microlon microplates (Greiner, Frickenhausen, Germany) were coated with 10 μg/mL KLH in 0.05 M Na₂CO₃ buffer (pH 9.6) at 4 °C overnight. After blocking with 1% BSA/PBS for two hours at rt and washing with 0.05% Tween-20/PBS plates were incubated with serial dilutions of sera (diluted in 0.1% BSA/PBS) for two hours. Plates were then washed three times with 0.05% Tween-20/PBS and incubated with HRP-conjugated goat-antimouse IgG+A+M antibody in a dilution of 1:1000 (Invitrogen, Basel, Switzerland). Detection was performed by using the 3,3′,5,5′-Tetramethylbenzidine Liquid Substrate System (Sigma-Aldrich, Buchs, Switzerland) according to manufacturer’s instructions.

T Cell Proliferation and ELISpot Analysis. On day 20 after the first immunization, mice were sacrificed and spleens were removed. RBCs were lysed by adding hypotonic ammonium chloride solution. Single cell suspensions were cultivated at 2 × 10⁵ cells per well in 96-well plates for 24 h in the presence of medium or KLH (10 μg/mL) for restimulation of T cells ex vivo. Proliferation of spleen cells was measured using the CellTiter 96 AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

ELISpot analysis was performed on day 20 after the first immunization using a mouse IFN-γ ELISpot Kit (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Briefly, 2 × 10⁵ spleen cells per well were stimulated for 24 h in the presence of medium, KLH (10 μg/mL) or the T cell mitogen concanavalin A (ConA, 10 μg/mL). Spot development was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions and the number of spots was determined using an ELISpot reader (AID, Straussberg, Germany).

Statistical Analysis. Statistical analyses were performed applying unpaired Student’s *t* test. All statistical analyses were performed with the Prism software (Graph Pad Software, San Diego, CA).
