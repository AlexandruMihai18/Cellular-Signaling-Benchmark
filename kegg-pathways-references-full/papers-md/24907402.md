**ABSTRACT**

Kisspeptin neurons are critical components of the neuronal network controlling the activity of the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons. A variety of genetically-manipulated mouse models have recently facilitated the study of the electrical activity of the two principal kisspeptin neuron populations located in the rostral periventricular area of the third ventricle (RP3V) and arcuate nucleus (ARN) in acute brain slices. We discuss here the mechanisms and pathways through which kisspeptin neurons regulate GnRH neuron activity. We then examine the different kisspeptin-green fluorescent protein mouse models being used for kisspeptin electrophysiology and the data obtained to date for RP3V and ARN kisspeptin neurons. In light of these new observations on the spontaneous firing rates, intrinsic membrane properties, and neurotransmitter regulation of kisspeptin neurons, we speculate on the physiological roles of the different kisspeptin populations.

**1. Introduction**

It is now over 10 years since the seminal discovery of the importance of kisspeptin signaling to human fertility (de Roux et al., 2003; Seminara et al., 2003). Over this time a substantial international effort has elucidated many aspects of the neurobiology of kisspeptin and its receptor Gpr54 (also known as Kiss1r). All mammalian species have two main populations of neurons that express kisspeptin; one located in the preoptic area and another in the arcuate nucleus (ARN; also called the infundibular nucleus in primates) (Oakley et al., 2009). Both of these kisspeptin populations play critical roles in the regulation of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons, in addition to other functions within the brain. As Gpr54 in GnRH neurons is the key site through which kisspeptin modulates fertility (Kirilov et al., 2013), it is especially important to understand the neurobiology of the kisspeptin neurons projecting to GnRH neurons. While molecular, neuroanatomical and whole animal studies have provided the foundations for our current understanding of the kisspeptin neurons, it is only recently that we have been able to interrogate the electrophysiological features and properties of kisspeptin neurons. The first studies of this type required laborious post-recording identification of kisspeptin neurons (Ducret et al., 2010; Qiu et al., 2011) but progress in this area has now accelerated considerably with the development of genetically-manipulated mouse lines in which kisspeptin neurons can be pre-identified for in vitro electrophysiology (Cravo et al., 2011; Gottsch et al., 2011; Mayer et al., 2010). The purpose of this review is to provide the reader with an up-to-date, in-depth account of the electrophysiological properties of both populations of kisspeptin neurons and illuminate how these new data aid our understanding of the physiological roles of kisspeptin neurons in regulating GnRH neurons. Before this, we start with a brief overview of how kisspeptin is thought to modulate the activity of GnRH neurons and the suspected roles of ARN and preoptic area kisspeptin neurons.

**2. Mechanisms of kisspeptin regulation of GnRH neurons**

Kisspeptin is the most potent activator of GnRH neuron firing discovered to date (Han et al., 2005). Patch-clamp electrophysiological studies undertaken in acute brain slices prepared from GnRH-GFP transgenic mice revealed that brief exposure (1–2 min) to nanomolar concentrations of kisspeptin evoked long-lasting (>10 min) electrical activation of GnRH neurons. This response is direct at the GnRH neuron and observed in response to both exogenous (Dumalska et al., 2008; Han et al., 2005; Liu et al., 2008; Pielecka-Fortuna et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2008) and endogenous (Liu et al., 2011) kisspeptin. This pattern of activation of GnRH neurons by kisspeptin was also demonstrated recently in vivo (Constantin et al., 2013). Experiments involving the electrical stimulation of preoptic kisspeptin neurons located in

anteroventral periventricular area (AVPV), have shown that these neurons need to fire action potentials at frequencies greater than 5 Hz to evoke kisspeptin release and activate GnRH neurons ([Liu et al., 2011](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yfrne.2011.01.001)). The direct stimulatory actions of kisspeptin on GnRH neurons do not exhibit sex differences or appear to be dependent upon gonadal steroid status ([Bosch et al., 2013](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yfrne.2013.01.001); [Dumalska et al., 2008](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yfrne.2008.01.001); [Han et al., 2005](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yfrne.2005.01.001); [Liu et al., 2008](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yfrne.2008.01.001); [Pielecka-Fortuna et al., 2008](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yfrne.2008.01.001)).

While these recent studies have highlighted the potent actions of kisspeptin on the GnRH neuron cell body and proximal dendrites, it seems likely that kisspeptin also acts at other sites on the GnRH neuron. Several studies have shown that kisspeptin can act within isolated mediobasal hypothalamic (MBH) explants to stimulate GnRH secretion ([d'Anglemont de Tassigny et al., 2008](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yfrne.2008.01.001); [Smith et al., 2011](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yfrne.2011.01.001); [Uenoyama et al., 2011](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yfrne.2011.01.001)) and this may represent actions of kisspeptin on the GnRH neuron “dendron” ([Herde et al., 2013](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yfrne.2013.01.001)). There is also evidence that kisspeptin acts at the level of the GnRH neuron dendrites within the organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis (OVLT) to activate GnRH neuron firing ([Herde et al., 2011](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yfrne.2011.01.001)). These sites of kisspeptin activation of GnRH neurons within the MBH and OVLT are outside the blood-brain-barrier and may underlie the ability of peripheral administration of kisspeptin to activate luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion in mammals ([Carty et al., 2007](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yfrne.2007.01.001); [Dhillon et al., 2005](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yfrne.2005.01.001); [Messenger et al., 2005](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yfrne.2005.01.001); [Shahab et al., 2005](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yfrne.2005.01.001); [Thompson et al., 2004](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yfrne.2004.01.001); [Tovar et al., 2006](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yfrne.2006.01.001)).

### 2.1. Pathways for direct kisspeptin neuron regulation of GnRH neurons

The anatomical pathways through which ARN and preoptic area kisspeptin cells innervate GnRH neurons are presently under investigation ([Fig. 1](#fig1)). Although ARN kisspeptin neurons send projections to the preoptic area in mice ([Yeo and Herbison, 2011](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yfrne.2011.01.001)), there is presently little evidence for direct innervation of GnRH neuron cell bodies and dendrites by ARN kisspeptin neurons in rodents ([Kallo et al., 2012](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yfrne.2012.01.001); [True et al., 2011](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yfrne.2011.01.001)). This may, however, represent a species difference as anatomical evidence shows that ARN kisspeptin neurons provide direct innervation to GnRH neuron somata and dendrites in sheep ([Lehman et al., 2010](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yfrne.2010.01.001)). Nevertheless, it seems unlikely that significant numbers of

![Fig. 1. Schematic diagram showing the direct and indirect pathways through which kisspeptin (blue) modulates the activity of GnRH neurons (black) in rodents. The RP3V kisspeptin neurons are known to make direct synaptic connections with GnRH neuron cell bodies and proximal dendrites. The anatomical pathways through which the heterogeneous ARN kisspeptin neurons influence GnRH neurons are not yet known. Indirect pathways (grey) involving GABA, glutamate and nitric oxide have been proposed and, although not critical for kisspeptin control of GnRH neurons, may have modulatory roles. The GnRH neuron receives inputs all along its spiny neurosecretory projection to the median eminence (dendron).](image.png)

kisspeptin fibers directly innervate GnRH nerve terminals in the external zone of the median eminence since: (i) very few kisspeptin fibers are found in external zone in rodents or primates ([Clarkson et al., 2009b](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yfrne.2009.01.001); [Ramaswamy et al., 2008](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yfrne.2008.01.001)), (ii) no ultrastructural evidence has been found for direct kisspeptin synaptic inputs on GnRH nerve terminals in the median eminence – although non-synaptic axo-axonic appositions have been described in rats and goats ([Matsuyama et al., 2011](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yfrne.2011.01.001); [Uenoyama et al., 2011](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yfrne.2011.01.001)), and (iii) kisspeptin neurons do not take up Fluorogold injected peripherally in rats or mice ([Uenoyama et al., 2011](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yfrne.2011.01.001); [Yeo and Herbison, 2011](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yfrne.2011.01.001)). Finally, whether Gpr54 is expressed in GnRH nerve terminals within the median eminence is currently not known. The recent demonstration that GnRH neurons project “dendrons” to the median eminence, that receive synaptic inputs along their entire projection, has raised the possibility that ARN kisspeptin neurons may innervate the dendron as it enters the median eminence ([Herde et al., 2013](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yfrne.2013.01.001)) ([Fig. 1](#fig1)).

In contrast to the ARN kisspeptin neurons, there is substantial evidence indicating that the preoptic kisspeptin neurons innervate directly the GnRH neuron cell body and proximal dendrites in rodents ([Fig. 1](#fig1)); (i) a strong correlation exists between the numbers of kisspeptin-immunoreactive cell bodies detected in the preoptic area and the density of kisspeptin fibers located in the vicinity of GnRH neuron cell bodies in the mouse ([Clarkson and Herbison, 2006](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yfrne.2006.01.001)), (ii) kisspeptin/tyrosine hydroxylase co-labeled fibers, that can only come from the preoptic area, are apposed to GnRH neurons ([Clarkson and Herbison, 2011](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yfrne.2011.01.001)) and (iii) the electrical activation of the AVPV results in the release of endogenous kisspeptin on GnRH neurons in mouse brain slices ([Liu et al., 2011](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yfrne.2011.01.001)).

### 2.2. Ion channels underlying the direct activation of GnRH neurons by kisspeptin

Brain slice studies undertaken to date indicate that kisspeptin exerts its potent stimulatory actions upon GnRH neurons by modulating the activity of potassium channels and non-selective cationic channels (NSCC) ([Dumalska et al., 2008](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yfrne.2008.01.001); [Liu et al., 2008](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yfrne.2008.01.001); [Pielecka-Fortuna et al., 2008](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yfrne.2008.01.001); [Zhang et al., 2008](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yfrne.2008.01.001)). There is wide consensus that kisspeptin closes barium-sensitive inward rectifier potassium channels (K$_{\text{ir}}$) to depolarize GnRH neurons ([Dumalska et al., 2008](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yfrne.2008.01.001); [Liu et al., 2008](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yfrne.2008.01.001); [Zhang et al., 2008](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yfrne.2008.01.001); [Zhang and Spergel, 2012](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yfrne.2012.01.001)) ([Fig. 2](#fig2)). Precisely how kisspeptin closes K$_{\text{ir}}$ channels in GnRH neurons is unclear although it is presumed to occur through the Gpr54 Gαq-PLC signaling pathway and may involve phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) ([Zhang et al., 2008](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yfrne.2008.01.001); [2013a](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yfrne.2013.01.001)). Evidence has also been presented suggesting a minor role for A-type potassium channels in the kisspeptin activation of GnRH neurons ([Pielecka-Fortuna et al., 2011](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yfrne.2011.01.001)) ([Fig. 2](#fig2)). The molecularly uncharacterized potassium channels underlying the slow afterhyperpolarization currents in GnRH neurons ([Lee et al., 2010](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yfrne.2010.01.001)) have also been suggested recently to be modulated by Gpr54 activation to allow GnRH neurons to exhibit their typical prolonged and sustained firing patterns following kisspeptin depolarization ([Zhang et al., 2013b](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yfrne.2013.01.001)) ([Fig. 2](#fig2)).

Alongside K$_{\text{ir}}$, the other channel strongly implicated in the kisspeptin activation of GnRH neurons is a 2-APB and flufenamic acid-sensitive NSCC likely to be the transient receptor potential cationic channel (TRPC) isoform 4, that is opened by kisspeptin to allow the influx of cations ([Liu et al., 2008](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yfrne.2008.01.001); [Zhang et al., 2008, 2013a](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yfrne.2008.01.001; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yfrne.2013.01.001)). The intracellular pathway for TRPC4 activation has been proposed to involve the Gαq activation of (i) phospholipase C (PLC) that then hydrolyses and dissociates PIP2 from the TRPC4 channel to potentiate its activity, and also (ii) tyrosine kinase cSrc to phosphorylate and activate TRPC4 ([Zhang et al., 2013a](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yfrne.2013.01.001)) ([Fig. 2](#fig2)).

The role of calcium in Gpr54 activation of GnRH neurons is unclear at present. While complex changes in intracellular calcium

levels have been observed in GnRH neurons after kisspeptin stimulation (Liu et al., 2008) the roles of intracellular calcium stores and calcium influx through the membrane remain unresolved (Liu et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2013a; Zhang and Spergel, 2012). It appears that kisspeptin-induced depolarization results in calcium influx through voltage-gated calcium channels while activation of the Gpr54-PLC signaling pathway results in calcium entry through TRPC channels in addition to calcium release from both IP3R-operated and ryanodine-operated calcium stores (Liu et al., 2008; Zhang and Spergel, 2012) (Fig. 2). The elevated cytosolic calcium in turn inactivates and/or internalizes high voltage-activated calcium channels through a calcium-calmodulin dependent pathway (Liu et al., 2008; Zhang and Spergel, 2012) (Fig. 2).

### 2.3. Indirect pathways for kisspeptin modulation of GnRH neurons

Although it is now established that direct kisspeptin-Gpr54 signaling at the GnRH neuron is critical for kisspeptin's ability to regulate fertility (Kirilov et al., 2013), there is also evidence that kisspeptin can modulate the activity of GnRH neurons in an indirect manner. For example, fast GABAergic and/or glutamatergic synaptic transmission is enhanced by kisspeptin in GnRH neurons from estradiol-treated, ovariectomized mice (Pielecka-Fortuna et al., 2008) (Fig. 1). Equally, kisspeptin regulates the release of nitric oxide in the vicinity of the GnRH neuron cell bodies and this is implicated in the estrogen positive feedback mechanism to generate the LH surge (Hanchate et al., 2012) (Fig. 1). These observations indicate that kisspeptin can regulate GnRH neuron activity through indirect pathways that, while not essential (Kirilov et al., 2013), may nevertheless play important modulatory roles.

### 3. Proposed roles for arcuate nucleus kisspeptin neurons in regulating fertility

The ARN kisspeptin neurons have been suggested to have roles in the gonadal steroid negative feedback mechanism, puberty onset, and GnRH pulse generation. An important feature of ARN kisspeptin neurons is that gonadectomy enhances, and estradiol or testosterone suppresses, their Kiss1 mRNA and protein levels (Adachi et al., 2007; Smith et al., 2005a,b). This has led to the hypothesis that gonadal steroids reduce a stimulatory kisspeptin input to GnRH neurons to suppress GnRH secretion, and thereby bring about negative feedback (Oakley et al., 2009; Popa et al., 2008). This proposed role of ARN kisspeptin neurons has gained support from studies showing that the post-ovariectomy increase in LH secretion was blunted in female Gpr54 knockout mice (Dungan et al., 2007) as well as in rats with arcuate nucleus-specific, saporin-deleted, kisspeptin neurons (Mittelman-Smith et al., 2012). It is difficult, however, in these types of studies to differentiate between effects on the negative feedback mechanism from those on pulse generation.

Kisspeptin neurons in the ARN may also have a role in puberty onset. Investigators have observed transient or sustained increases in arcuate kisspeptin levels across postnatal development (Cao and Patisaul, 2013; Desrozières et al., 2012; Takumi et al., 2012). Furthermore, genetic deletion of estrogen receptor alpha (ER$\alpha$) from all kisspeptin neurons results in the early onset of puberty in female mice and this has been attributed to the ARN kisspeptin population (Mayer et al., 2010).

Studies with Gpr54 antagonists have demonstrated that kisspeptin-Gpr54 signaling is required for normal pulsatile GnRH and LH secretion in a range of experimental animals (Li et al., 2009; Roseweir et al., 2009). This role may involve ARN kisspeptin neurons as mice with diphtheria toxin-deleted ARN kisspeptin neurons fail to exhibit regular estrous cycles (Mayer and Boehm, 2011). Furthermore, knockdown of kisspeptin expression in the ARN was recently shown to have a small inhibitory effect on pulsatile LH release (Beale et al., 2014), and infusion of a Gpr54 antagonist directly into the ARN suppresses pulsatile LH secretion (Li et al., 2009) indicating a role for kisspeptin-Gpr54 signaling within this area for pulse generation. Most importantly, however, the release of kisspeptin has been found to occur in an episodic manner within the MBH of the monkey and this can coincide with

pulsatile GnRH release (Keen et al., 2008). Another property of ARN kisspeptin neurons is that they co-express neurokinin B (NKB) and dynorphin (Dyn), among other neurotransmitters, in a number of species (Goodman et al., 2007; Navarro et al., 2009; Wakabayashi et al., 2010). To reflect this co-expression pattern, these neurons are referred to as Kisspeptin-NKB-Dyn (KNDy) neurons (Lehman et al., 2010). In addition, on the basis of anatomical studies, KNDy neurons have been suggested to form a reciprocally-connected neural network that drives GnRH neuron pulsatility (Lehman et al., 2010; Navarro, 2012).

### 4. Proposed roles for preoptic kisspeptin neurons in regulating fertility

The preoptic kisspeptin neurons of the rodent are located in the rostral periventricular zone extending from the AVPV into the peri-ventricular nucleus (Clarkson and Herbison, 2006; Clarkson et al., 2009b; Gottsch et al., 2004). This distribution lies neatly within the previously defined rostral periventricular area of the third ventricle (RP3V) (Herbison, 2008). The RP3V kisspeptin neurons are thought to have a primary role in estrogen positive feedback to activate GnRH neurons to generate the preovulatory GnRH/LH surge in female rodents (Adachi et al., 2007; Clarkson et al., 2008; Smith et al., 2006; Tsukamura et al., 2010). The RP3V kisspeptin neurons are highly sexually dimorphic, with 10- to 20-fold more kisspeptin neurons in females compared with males (Clarkson and Herbison, 2006; Kauffman et al., 2007) and express ERα (Smith et al., 2005a), the key receptor isoform involved in the surge mechanism (Wintermantel et al., 2006). There is also evidence that RP3V kisspeptin neurons are activated coincidently with GnRH neurons at the time of the GnRH/LH surge (Clarkson et al., 2008; Smith et al., 2006) and are essential for its generation in mice and rats (Adachi et al., 2007; Clarkson et al., 2008; Mayer et al., 2010; Smith et al., 2006). Further, circadian inputs may impact upon RP3V kisspeptin neurons to time the onset of the GnRH surge in rodents (Robertson et al., 2009; Smarr et al., 2012; Williams et al., 2011).

Studies also indicate that the RP3V kisspeptin neurons are involved in puberty onset in female rodents. Intriguingly, RP3V kisspeptin-immunoreactive cell bodies and kisspeptin fibers around GnRH neurons appear at the time of puberty onset in male and female rodents (Clarkson and Herbison, 2006; Desrozières et al., 2012). As this increase in kisspeptin biosynthesis is dependent upon estrogen, it is thought that RP3V kisspeptin neurons represent a population of neurons brought into play in late puberty to enable the final development of the positive feedback mechanism in female rodents (Clarkson et al., 2009a).

### 5. Kisspeptin-GFP mouse models for electrophysiology

There are currently four different genetically-manipulated mouse lines being used for electrophysiological studies of kisspeptin neurons. Three of these are related to kisspeptin and one is related to NKB (Fig. 3).

#### 5.1. Elias Kiss-Cre transgenic line (Cravo et al., 2013; Frazão et al., 2013, 2014)

The Elias Kiss-Cre mouse is a promoter transgenic line in which a construct containing ~180 kb of sequence flanking the kisspeptin gene, that now encodes Cre recombinase, was integrated in a random manner into the genome (Fig. 3A). Typical of the “positional effects” observed with promoter transgenics, only one (J2-4) of the 14 independent Kiss-Cre founder lines generated by these investigators had the desired expression pattern of Cre in the

#### 5.2. Steiner Kiss1-CreGFP knockin line (Gottsch et al., 2011; Navarro et al., 2011)

This is not a transgenic but a knockin mouse line where a Cre-GFP fusion cassette was inserted into the endogenous kisspeptin locus just ahead of the native Kiss1 start site (Gottsch et al., 2011) (Fig. 3B). This resulted in a mouse line in which both Cre and GFP are expressed in the RP3V, ARN and a range of other cell types within the brain. Analysis by RT-PCR showed that 100% of GFP-positive cells expressed Kiss1 transcripts. The relationship of GFP to kisspeptin peptide expressing cells is not known. As the expression of GFP in these mice is driven by the transcription rate of the kisspeptin gene, its expression varies according to the hormonal state of the mouse. This means that only cells currently expressing kisspeptin should express GFP and so avoids the potential problems of Cre-driven GFP expression noted above. The major caveat of this mouse line, however, is that electrophysiological recordings can only be made from ARN neurons in OVX mice, or RP3V neurons in intact or estradiol-treated mice. Outside these conditions, the GFP fluorescence is too weak to enable reliable identification of the GFP-positive cells (Gottsch et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2013c).

#### 5.3. Boehm Kisspeptin-IRES-Cre knockin line (de Croft et al., 2012, 2013b; Piet et al., 2013)

This mouse line is similar to the Steiner mouse in that it is also a knockin model, although in this case, an IRES-Cre was inserted immediately downstream of the kisspeptin coding sequences resulting in bicistronic mRNA that independently codes for kisspeptin and Cre (Mayer et al., 2010) (Fig. 3C). By crossing this kisspeptin-IRES-Cre line with GFP reporter mice it has been possible to visualize kisspeptin neurons in the RP3V and ARN as well as GFP-expressing cells in many other areas of the brain (de Croft et al., 2012). In these mice, >90% of RP3V and ARN kisspeptin peptide expressing cells are positive for GFP and, critically for the electrophysiological studies, >80% of GFP cells have been shown to express kisspeptin peptide in the ARN of both sexes and RP3V of females (de Croft et al., 2012; Mayer et al., 2010). It is presently unknown why the relationship of GFP to kisspeptin-immunoreactive neurons in the RP3V of the male is poor.

#### 5.4. NKB-GFP transgenic line (Ruka et al., 2013)

This is another promoter transgenic mouse line in which GFP replaces coding sequences for NKB (Tac2) within a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) (of unknown size) that has then randomly integrated into the genome (Gong et al., 2003) (Fig. 3D). GFP cells in the NKB-GFP transgenic mouse can be used to target ARN kisspeptin neurons (Ruka et al., 2013) as most NKB neurons in the ARN express kisspeptin in the female mouse, although it is worth noting

(B) Steiner Kiss1-CreGFP knockin mouse ([Gottsch et al., 2011](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2011.01.017)) where both Cre (red) and GFP (green) have been inserted into the endogenous *Kiss1* coding sequence ahead of the normal *Kiss1* start site. This line results in the expression of Cre and GFP but essentially deletes *Kiss1* expression. (C) Boehm kisspeptin-IRES-Cre knockin line ([Mayer et al., 2010](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2010.01.017)) where an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) Cre (red) has been placed after the stop codon for *Kiss1* in exon 2.

that this is less so in the male ([Navarro et al., 2011](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2011.01.017)). Many other cells throughout the brain also express GFP in this mouse line. Analysis by single cell RT-PCR shows that 70–100% of GFP cells in the ARN of male NKB-GFP mice express *Kiss1* or *Tac2* transcripts with higher levels found in gonadectomized mice. The relationship of GFP fluorescence to kisspeptin peptide-expressing neurons is unknown.

### 6. Electrophysiology of kisspeptin neurons

#### 6.1. Spontaneous firing of ARN and RP3V kisspeptin neurons in vitro

Studies of the electrical activity of kisspeptin neurons reveal that their spontaneous firing rates are markedly different between the two main kisspeptin neuron populations. Whereas most ARN kisspeptin neurons are silent or fire at low frequencies ([de Croft et al., 2012](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2012.01.017); [Frazao et al., 2013](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2013.01.017); [Ruka et al., 2013](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2013.01.017)), the majority of RP3V kisspeptin neurons are spontaneously active in wild-type ([Ducret et al., 2010](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2010.01.017)), Boehm Kisspeptin-IRES-Cre ([de Croft et al., 2012](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2012.01.017)) and Steiner Kiss1-CreGFP ([Zhang et al., 2013c](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2013.01.017)) mice, and fire at much higher frequencies (Fig. 4A). Interestingly, only a small proportion of RP3V kisspeptin neurons in male and female Elias kisspeptin-Cre mice were found to exhibit spontaneous firing (type I, Fig. 4B), whereas most were silent (type II) ([Frazao et al., 2013](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2013.01.017)). Whether these differences result from the targeting of different RP3V kisspeptin neuron sub-populations, the recording of ‘ectopic’ GFP neurons, or from technical differences between studies remains unclear. Nevertheless, whereas spontaneously active kisspeptin neurons fire in an irregular pattern in the ARN, those in the RP3V display a variety of firing patterns. In females, most RP3V kisspeptin neurons fire action potentials in an irregular or tonic manner whereas approximately a quarter of these neurons exhibit bursty firing patterns (Fig. 4A). Whether the various firing patterns of kisspeptin neurons and the ARN-RP3V differences result from heterogeneity of these neurons in their ion channel complement or their synaptic input has not been explored. It has been suggested that the expression of ATP-sensitive potassium channels (*K*<sub>ATP</sub>) may account for silent, type II kisspeptin neurons in the RP3V ([Frazao et al., 2013](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2013.01.017)). Importantly, it remains to be determined whether the spontaneous firing patterns of kisspeptin neurons in slices are a good representation of their electrical activity in vivo ([Constantin et al., 2013](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2013.01.017)).

The initial analysis of kisspeptin neuron spontaneous firing rates has unveiled unexpected sex differences. A larger proportion of ARN kisspeptin neurons are spontaneously active in males compared with female mice ([de Croft et al., 2012](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2012.01.017); [Frazao et al., 2013](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2013.01.017)) and a similar trend has been observed in the RP3V, where kisspeptin neurons fire at significantly higher rates in males ([Frazao et al., 2013](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2013.01.017)) (Fig. 4B). These sex differences were surprising as, at least with respect to the ARN, kisspeptin neurons were thought to have similar roles in regulating fertility in the two sexes ([Smith et al., 2005a, 2005b](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2005.01.017)). However, it is important to note that kisspeptin neurons in the ARN are very likely to be involved in regulating the activity of many different neuronal networks and not just controlling GnRH neurons ([Yeo and Herbison, 2011](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2011.01.017)). A very significant challenge for the field will be that of identifying the sub-populations of kisspeptin neurons within the ARN and RP3V involved in the GnRH neuronal network.

### 6.3. Ionic currents in RP3V kisspeptin neurons

Studies to date have identified a number of specific ionic conductances in RP3V kisspeptin neurons. The hyperpolarization-activated current \( I_h \), an ionic current with unique properties and complex roles (Biel et al., 2009), has been detected in female RP3V kisspeptin neurons (Piet et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2013c). The channels underlying \( I_h \) in kisspeptin neurons may be heteromeric as RP3V kisspeptin neurons express mRNAs for subunits 1–3 of the hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channels (HCN) (Zhang et al., 2013c), with HCN1 being the most abundant (Fig. 5A). Functionally, \( I_h \) mediates a depolarizing sag and a rebound depolarization, and tunes the timing of rebound action potentials (Piet et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2013c). \( I_h \) acts in combination with calcium currents, particularly low-threshold T-type currents (\( I_T \)), to generate rebound firing (Piet et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2013c) and substantial evidence exists for the presence of low-threshold calcium currents as well as mRNAs coding for Caᵥ3.1–3.3 subunits in kisspeptin neurons of the RP3V, with Caᵥ3.1 being the most abundant (Zhang et al., 2013c) (Fig. 5A). These currents have been suggested to underlie burst firing in RP3V kisspeptin neurons (Zhang et al., 2013c), which may be of importance for the frequency-dependent release of kisspeptin onto GnRH neurons (Liu et al., 2011). In support of this hypothesis, \( I_T \) controls the number of rebound action potentials fired, producing high-frequency bursts following hyperpolarization (Zhang et al., 2013c), whereas \( I_h \) participates in tuning the dynamics of rebound firing (Piet et al., 2013). Blockade of \( I_h \) in RP3V kisspeptin neurons, however, does not have any impact on their spontaneous firing, even in neurons displaying spontaneous ‘burst firing’ (Piet et al., 2013), suggesting that \( I_h \) does not act as a pacemaker current. The impact of \( I_T \) on kisspeptin neuron spontaneous firing and its role in spontaneous bursting, on the other hand, have not been determined.

Silent, type II, kisspeptin neurons in the RP3V express a tonic potassium conductance reminiscent of \( K_{ATP} \) channels, which results in lower \( R_{\text{in}} \) and RMP in these neurons compared with their active, type I, counterparts (Frazao et al., 2013) (Fig. 5A). \( K_{ATP} \) channels are thought to regulate neural excitability (Tanner et al., 2011) and in particular burst firing in substantia nigra dopamine neurons (Schiemann et al., 2012). Whether these channels play a similar role in kisspeptin neurons has not been investigated, although contrary to this idea, it was only silent kisspeptin neurons that expressed \( K_{ATP} \) channels (Frazao et al., 2013). \( K_{ATP} \) channels are also thought to be involved in glucose sensing in hypothalamic neurons (Gonzalez et al., 2009) and have been proposed to play such a role in GnRH neurons (Zhang et al., 2007) – although subsequent investigations do not fully support this hypothesis (Huang et al., 2008a,b; Roland and Moenter, 2011). It is possible that \( K_{ATP} \) channels might play a similar role in RP3V kisspeptin neurons and further experiments will be needed to determine the precise role of these channels in the metabolic regulation of kisspeptin neurons and the GnRH neural network (Roa et al., 2008).

It has also been reported recently that female RP3V kisspeptin neurons express persistent sodium currents and, in a proportion of these cells, A-type potassium currents (Zhang et al., 2013) (Fig. 5A). Unpublished work in our laboratory, in addition, indicates that all female RP3V kisspeptin neurons express both transient and sustained potassium currents, although they are only activated at quite depolarized potentials (Piet and Herbison, unpublished observation). In neurons, A-type potassium channels play a role in the repolarization phase of the AP (Bean, 2007) and are also involved in synaptic integration in dendrites (Johnston et al., 2000). Although the functional impact of A-type currents in kisspeptin neurons has not yet been fully characterized, their activation at depolarized potentials suggests their primary role may be

### 6.2. Basic membrane properties of ARN and RP3V kisspeptin neurons in vitro

Whole-cell patch clamp studies indicate that RP3V and ARN kisspeptin neurons not only differ in their spontaneous firing rates and patterns, but also by their resting membrane potential (RMP). Whereas male and female RP3V kisspeptin neurons rest on average at around −55 to −60 mV (Frazao et al., 2013; Piet et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2013c), a wider range of RMPs (−50 to −75 mV) has been reported for male and female ARN kisspeptin neurons (Alreja, 2013; de Croft et al., 2013b; Frazao et al., 2013; Gottsch et al., 2011; Qiu et al., 2011; True et al., 2013).

Kisspeptin neurons in male and female RP3V and ARN exhibit gigohm input resistance (\( R_{\text{in}} \)) (Alreja, 2013; Frazao et al., 2013; Piet et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2013), indicating that these neurons display little background leak conductance at rest. Consistent with this, kisspeptin neurons have a low rheobase (the minimum amount of current injection required to evoke the firing of action potentials) (Alreja, 2013; Piet et al., 2013), highlighting that they are responsive to inputs of only moderate amplitude. Female RP3V kisspeptin neurons fire action potentials at frequencies up to 10 Hz with little adaptation in response to depolarizing current injection, suggesting that these neurons can sustain long periods of activation (Piet et al., 2013). In contrast, male ARN kisspeptin neurons exhibit high adaptation to depolarizing current injections (de Croft and Herbison, unpublished observation).

in shaping AP waveforms. Similarly, the role of the persistent sodium current in RP3V kisspeptin neurons is unknown.

6.4. Ionic currents in ARN kisspeptin neurons

At present, less is known about the ion channels expressed by ARN kisspeptin neurons compared with their RP3V counterparts. I<sub>h</sub> and I<sub>T</sub> have been reported in female guinea pigs (Qiu et al., 2011) and mice (Gottsch et al., 2011). I<sub>h</sub> may be mediated by heteromeric channels, as mRNAs for all the HCN subunits are found in ARN kisspeptin neurons, with individual cells expressing various combinations. Quantitatively, HCN2 and 3 appear to be the most abundantly expressed subunits compared with HCN1 (Fig. 5B). The Ca<sub>v</sub>3.1 subunit of T-type channels was found most highly expressed in a proportion of ARN kisspeptin neurons, although Ca<sub>v</sub>3.2 was also detected (Gottsch et al., 2011) (Fig. 5B). The functional impact of these currents remains to be fully assessed in ARN kisspeptin neurons. Gottsch and collaborators (Gottsch et al., 2011) suggested that they are involved in mediating NMDA-induced burst firing, although this possibility was not formally tested.

ARN kisspeptin neurons also express NSCCs that are activated following exposure to leptin in the female guinea pig (Qiu et al., 2011). Single-cell RT-PCR reveals that most ARN kisspeptin neurons express TRPC mRNAs and pharmacological experiments indicate that TRPC channels mediate the effect of leptin on these neurons (Fig. 5B). The role of leptin receptors and leptin-induced excitation of ARN kisspeptin neurons in the context of the regulation of GnRH secretion, however, is unclear as leptin signaling in kisspeptin neurons is not required for fertility (Cravo et al., 2013; Donato et al., 2011).

note, likely methodological differences have resulted in the rates of sIPSCs observed in female RP3V kisspeptin neurons being very different between studies (Frazao et al., 2013; Piet et al., 2013). Nevertheless, both kisspeptin populations in females have been found to exhibit higher IPSC frequencies before puberty compared with after, suggesting possible plasticity at GABAergic synapses on kisspeptin neurons during the pubertal transition (Frazao et al., 2013). Also, in adults, sEPSC rates were higher in RP3V kisspeptin neurons from males compared with females (Frazao et al., 2013), suggesting that a sex difference exists in glutamatergic inputs to this population. Additional experiments will be required to determine the precise mechanisms underlying these differences and their functional importance.

6.6. Neuropeptide modulation of kisspeptin neuron electrical activity

In relation to peptidergic inputs to kisspeptin neurons, morphological data indicate that sub-populations of kisspeptin neurons in the female RP3V and ARN may receive innervation from GnRH neurons (Kallo et al., 2013), RFRP-3 neurons (Poling et al., 2013; Rizwan et al., 2012), as well as from ARN POMC neurons (True et al., 2013). Moreover, RP3V kisspeptin neurons may be innervated by suprachiasmatic nucleus vasopressin neurons (Vida et al., 2010; Williams et al., 2011). Functionally, virtually nothing is known of the effects of these inputs on the electrical activity of kisspeptin neurons, although it was recently reported that the cocaine and amphetamine related transcript (CART) peptide induces AP firing in ARN kisspeptin neurons (True et al., 2013) (Fig. 5B). Additionally, it is worth mentioning that agonists to the κ- and μ-opioid receptors (OR) cause an outward current (hyperpolarizing) in RP3V kisspeptin neurons, presumably via activation of G-protein coupled inward rectifying potassium channels (GIRK) (Zhang et al., 2013c) (Fig. 5A).

In contrast to the RP3V, a wealth of data is available regarding neuropeptide modulation of ARN kisspeptin neuron electrical activity. Several studies have examined the effects of the neuropeptides coexpressed in ARN kisspeptin neurons and have revealed that ARN kisspeptin neurons (i) are not excited by kisspeptin (de Croft et al., 2013b), (ii) are depolarized and fire action potentials upon activation of NK3R, the ‘preferred’ receptor for NKB (de Croft et al., 2013b; Gottsch et al., 2011; Ruka et al., 2013), and (iii) are inhibited by κ-OR agonists (de Croft et al., 2013b; Ruka et al., 2013). These studies have also expanded on the mechanisms of NKB actions on kisspeptin neurons. Whereas it was assumed

6.5. GABAergic and glutamatergic inputs to kisspeptin neurons

Cell-attached and whole-cell electrophysiological studies are provide definitive information on the functional neurotransmitter receptors expressed by kisspeptin neurons that regulate their electrical excitability. Essentially all kisspeptin neurons in both the ARN and RP3V have been shown to express ionotropic GABA<sub>A</sub> and glutamate receptors (Frazao et al., 2013; Gottsch et al., 2011; Piet et al., 2013; Qiu et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2013c) (Fig. 5). Analysis of synaptic transmission in these neurons indicated the presence of spontaneous excitatory post-synaptic currents (sEPSCs) mediated by AMPA receptors as well as spontaneous inhibitory post-synaptic currents (sIPSCs) mediated by GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors. Of

from anatomical data (Burke et al., 2006; Navarro et al., 2009, 2011) that the excitatory effect of NKB would be mediated by activation of NK3Rs, in vitro experiments revealed that the effect of NKB on ARN kisspeptin neuron firing requires the activation of all three tachykinin receptor subtypes, which may all be expressed in these neurons (de Croft et al., 2013b) (Fig. 5B). These surprising findings that NKB signals via multiple receptors in concert in ARN kisspeptin neurons may provide a cellular substrate for the functional reversal seen in humans with TACR3/TAC3 mutations (Gianetti et al., 2010; Plant and Kalil, 2013), although other compensatory mechanisms could also be at play. In addition, this suggests that activation of NK3Rs with its agonist Senktide, which has been used in many studies to probe the effects of NKB on LH release in rodents (Garcia-Galiano et al., 2012; Grachev et al., 2012a,b; Kinsey-Jones et al., 2012; Navarro et al., 2009, 2011, 2012), may only reflect part of the mechanisms by which NKB may alter GnRH and LH release in these species. Accordingly, pulsatile LH release is sensitive to blockade of all three tachykinin receptors but resistant to blockade of NK3R alone (Noritake et al., 2011). Of note, however, the mechanisms of ARN NKB signaling may vary across species as pulsatile LH release is sensitive to NK3R blockade in sheep (Goodman et al., 2013b).

### 7. Functional roles of kisspeptin neurons in light of electrophysiological evidence

#### 7.1. Gonadal steroid negative feedback

As outlined in Section 3, the seminal reports by the Steiner laboratory on the regulation of Kiss1 gene expression (Smith et al., 2005a,b) led to speculation that gonadal steroid negative feedback resulted from the suppression of a stimulatory ARN kisspeptin influence on GnRH neurons (Popa et al., 2008). This hypothesis predicted that ARN kisspeptin neurons would be more active in gonadectomized states than in animals with normal levels of gonadal steroids. However, none of the electrophysiological studies undertaken to date on ARN kisspeptin neurons have found evidence to support this supposition. The spontaneous firing rate of ARN kisspeptin neurons is not increased by gonadectomy in males (Alreja, 2013; Ruka et al., 2013) or females (de Croft et al., 2012) or decreased by estradiol treatment of ovariectomized females (Frazao et al., 2013) (Table 1).

While these findings provide little support for the hypothesis, it is important to recognize that electrophysiological studies have been undertaken in the acute brain slice where most of the afferent inputs to ARN kisspeptin neurons will have been severed. This implies that negative feedback involves a distributed gonadal steroid-sensitive neural network including the ARN kisspeptin neurons (Alreja, 2013; de Croft et al., 2012), which is disrupted by the slicing procedure or simply inactive in the slice. It is also possible that negative feedback-associated changes in electrical activity are only reflected in the firing of ensembles of ARN kisspeptin neurons rather than at the single cell level, as is the case of circadian variations of suprachiasmatic neuron firing (Meijer et al., 2012). Additionally, negative feedback may manifest as plasticity in specific electrophysiological properties rather than in global changes in their firing. For example, in vivo estradiol treatment of OVX females causes a decrease in cell capacitance (an electrophysiological correlate of membrane surface area) in ARN kisspeptin neurons, consistent with the hypertrophy of kisspeptin neurons observed in women and primates under low circulating gonadal steroid conditions (Romoto et al., 2007). In vivo estradiol treatment is also associated with a decrease in IPSC amplitude in ARN kisspeptin neurons, an effect dependent on their expression of ERα (Table 1). However, the ultimate consequences of these changes on ARN kisspeptin neuron output remain unclear, and in some

instances may be at odds with expected negative feedback-like effects. For example, GDX decreases \(R_{\text{in}}\) and increases the rheobase of male ARN kisspeptin neurons, suggesting decreased excitability of these neurons under conditions of high GnRH secretion (Table 1).

While attention has focused almost entirely upon the ARN kisspeptin neurons in relation to gonadal steroid negative feedback, it is worth mentioning that the spontaneous firing and some of the intrinsic properties of RP3V kisspeptin neurons change in relation to negative feedback in vivo. Some of these effects are in a similar direction to that reported for Kiss1 mRNA (Smith et al., 2005a) such that, for example, circulating gonadal steroids increase RP3V kisspeptin neuron spontaneous firing rates (Table 2). Notably, although circulating gonadal steroids do alter RP3V kisspeptin neuron electrophysiological properties, these changes are difficult to reconcile with negative feedback since they might increase GnRH secretion.

In summary, electrophysiological data to date have indicated that circulating gonadal steroids have little impact on ARN kisspeptin neuron electrical activity. While there is evidence that gonadal steroids may exert some effects on ARN kisspeptin neuron electrophysiological properties, these actions are subtle and, together, are currently insufficient to account for significant changes in the output of these neurons. Overall, these findings do not support the view that ARN kisspeptin neurons are the sole mediators of gonadal steroid negative feedback, and suggest that either afferent inputs to these neurons are important or at least permissive for any role they may play in mediating the gonadal steroid negative feedback, or that ARN kisspeptin neurons are simply not involved in this mechanism. Alternatively, the effects of circulating estrogen on Kiss1 gene and peptide expression (Adachi et al., 2007; Smith et al., 2005a,b) alone may account for the mechanisms for estrogen negative feedback. Regardless, a clear dissociation exists between the effects of gonadal steroids on Kiss1 mRNA expression and kisspeptin neuron firing in vitro. It is suspected that a major confound in undertaking these types of studies is that ARN kisspeptin neurons have multiple physiological roles and the pre-identification of the sub-population of ARN kisspeptin neurons involved in the GnRH neuronal network is presently impossible. It is also likely that clarity on kisspeptin firing rates and patterns will only come from electrophysiological recordings of ARN kisspeptin neurons in vivo.

#### 7.2. Gonadal steroid positive feedback

As highlighted in Section 4, a large body of evidence implicates RP3V kisspeptin neurons in the generation of the preovulatory GnRH surge. Studies using cFos had indicated that RP3V kisspeptin neurons were electrically activated coincidently with the GnRH neurons at the time of the preovulatory GnRH/LH surge (Adachi et al., 2007; Clarkson et al., 2008; Smith et al., 2006). As such it was hypothesized that, in association with circadian inputs, positive feedback levels of estrogen would impact upon RP3V kisspeptin neurons to enhance their excitability.

A trend toward increased firing rates at the time of the surge was reported in small numbers of RP3V kisspeptin neurons in an initial study (Ducret et al., 2010). However, a subsequent investigation using the Boehm Kisspeptin-IRES-Cre mice showed no significant change in RP3V kisspeptin neuron spontaneous firing rates or patterns around the time of the proestrous GnRH/LH surge (de Croft et al., 2012) (Table 2). As for the ARN kisspeptin neurons and estrogen negative feedback, this suggests the possible involvement of estrogen-sensitive ‘interneurons’ upstream of RP3V kisspeptin neurons (Fig. 6). Alternatively, the lack of any robust change in firing may result from the loss of circadian inputs to kisspeptin neurons in the slice that are thought to be important at this time (Williams and Kriegsfeld, 2012).

While elevated proestrous levels of estrogen do not cause global alterations in the spontaneous firing rates of RP3V kisspeptin neurons, significant changes were found in their intrinsic properties. Of particular interest, $I_{\text{h}}$ is upregulated on the day of proestrus—an effect mediated by high circulating estradiol (Piet et al., 2013) (Table 2 and Fig. 6). This was also observed in another positive feedback experimental model (Zhang et al., 2013c), although owing to the technical difficulties associated with the Steiner Kiss1-CreGFP mouse model (see Section 5.2), the comparison with low estradiol could only be undertaken in tyrosine hydroxylase-GFP mice, in which GFP was used to target kisspeptin neurons.

Functionally, the upregulation of $I_{\text{h}}$ results in an increase in the depolarizing sag and rebound associated with this current, and may also contribute to the decrease in $R_{\text{in}}$ observed on proestrus (Table 2). Upregulation of $I_{\text{h}}$ also causes estrous cycle-dependent alterations in the membrane properties of kisspeptin neurons, significantly increasing its contribution to the regulation of the membrane time constant and to the dynamics of rebound AP firing (Piet et al., 2013). Consequently, the proestrous upregulation of $I_{\text{h}}$ may significantly dampen the effects of inhibitory neurotransmitters (depolarizing sag) and also convert inhibition into excitation by promoting rebound firing. Strikingly, $I_{\text{T}}$, which plays a significant role in generating rebound firing, undergoes a similar upregulation under conditions of high circulating estradiol in a positive feedback paradigm (Zhang et al., 2013c) (Table 2 and Fig. 6). A role for these ionic currents in ‘converting’ inhibition to spiking is supported by findings in other systems (Chen et al., 2001; Israel et al., 2008). The precise physiological role of rebound firing in RP3V kisspeptin neurons remains to be assessed in the context of the preovulatory GnRH/LH surge, although it is suggested to play a role in high-frequency release of kisspeptin onto GnRH neurons (Zhang et al., 2013c).

$I_{\text{h}}$ is also known to stabilize the RMP (Biel et al., 2009; Robinson and Siegelbaum, 2003). It is therefore tempting to speculate that the increased magnitude of $I_{\text{h}}$ in pre-surge RP3V kisspeptin neurons may act to ‘isolate’ these neurons from background synaptic activity, making relevant signals, such as those conveying circadian time (Williams and Kriegsfeld, 2012), more salient (Fig. 6). In addition, dendritic HCN channels contribute to synaptic integration by decreasing EPSP summation (George et al., 2009; Kim et al., 2012; Nolan et al., 2004). Although it is currently not known whether HCN channels are segregated in the soma or dendrites of RP3V kisspeptin neurons, the $I_{\text{h}}$ upregulation seen during proestrus could potentially have significant effects on excitatory synaptic transmission in these neurons. Surprisingly, however, $I_{\text{h}}$ activation curves and pharmacological experiments indicate that HCN channels in RP3V kisspeptin neurons show little activity at rest (Piet et al., 2013), moderating the range of possible effects that this current might have on neuronal excitability.

ARN KNDy neurons excites and inhibits, respectively, the KNDy neuron population in a coordinated fashion to generate periodic electrical activity. This is then transmitted to the GnRH neurons using kisspeptin as a neurotransmitter (Goodman et al., 2013a; Lehman et al., 2010; Navarro et al., 2009; Navarro, 2012).

In vitro electrophysiology provides the opportunity to test some of the predictions at the single cell level. Indeed, as noted in Section 6.6, there is a consistent set of electrophysiological data from kisspeptin-GFP and NKB-GFP mouse models showing that almost all ARN KNDy neurons in male mice express functional NK3Rs (de Croft et al., 2013b; Navarro et al., 2011; Ruka et al., 2013), confirming anatomical data (Burke et al., 2006; Navarro et al., 2009, 2011). Moreover, electrophysiological experiments extended our understanding of NKB signaling as it revealed its action at all tachykinin receptors (de Croft et al., 2013b). On the other hand, while anatomical studies have provided weak evidence for κ-OR expression on ARN KNDy neurons (Navarro et al., 2009, 2011), electrophysiological studies have shown that Dyn potently inhibits their electrical activity, although where Dyn acts has not been fully established (de Croft et al., 2013b; Ruka et al., 2013).

Other more complex aspects of the pulse generator model are currently under investigation using electrophysiological approaches. For example, the model predicts that Dyn is released from kisspeptin neurons as a result of “feedforward” excitation by NKB, thereby inhibiting kisspeptin neurons and terminating a period of activity. However, in vitro electrophysiological data indicate that while Dyn inhibits kisspeptin neurons, it does not reduce NK3R-dependent excitation unless the Dyn-mediated inhibition precedes the NKB-induced excitation (Ruka et al., 2013). Furthermore, Dyn does not seem to be released in response to activation of NK3R (Ruka et al., 2013). While these types of pharmacological studies are very difficult to interpret at a cellular level, they do provide some initial concern about the proposed model. It is worth noting, however, that while endogenous Dyn regulates pulsatile GnRH/LH release in sheep and goats (Goodman et al., 2013b; Wakabayashi et al., 2010), it may not play a significant role in rodents (Grachev et al., 2012a), in good agreement with the failure to detect endogenous Dyn release from mouse KNDy neurons in slices. Further investigations are needed to gain a better understanding of the roles and interactions of KNDy neuron-derived neuropeptides with respect to the regulation of GnRH/LH release.

Experimentally, it will be important to establish brain slice experimental paradigms in which interconnected KNDy neurons can be interrogated. Our studies to date using paired recordings from kisspeptin neurons in the ARN have failed to provide any evidence of neurochemical connections between these cells (de Croft et al., 2013a). As neuropeptide release from ARN kisspeptin neurons is very likely to be frequency coded (Liu et al., 2011), it will be critical to establish which firing rates are required to release which neuropeptide. It is also pertinent to note that KNDy neurons may also utilize glutamate and galanin (Ciofi et al., 2006; Kallo et al., 2012) and these transmitters would also be expected to be released from KNDy neuron terminals in the ARN.

The pulse generator model requires KNDy neuron neuropeptides to influence the electrical activity of the KNDy network and that of GnRH neurons in a coordinated fashion. This could hypothetically be achieved through (i) spatial segregation of neuropeptides to different axon collaterals of the same cell, resulting in their differential release on differing target cells, (ii) different kinetics in the actions of neuropeptides on the target cells, or (iii) release of all neuropeptides and transmitters from KNDy neuron axons, with the pattern of post-synaptic receptor expression dictating the functional role of individual connections. The first possibility seems unlikely as there is presently little evidence for this in the mammalian nervous system (Sulzer et al., 1998). In favor of the latter suggestion, ARN kisspeptin neurons respond to NKB and Dyn but

Fig. 6. Schematic representation of the role of RP3V kisspeptin neurons (blue) in estrogen positive feedback to the GnRH neuron (black). In addition to increasing Kiss1 gene expression, elevated circulating estradiol (E₂) up-regulates ionic currents such as $I_h$ and $I_T$. These intrinsic changes may prepare RP3V kisspeptin neurons to respond to synaptic input from the central clock suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) to appropriately time the GnRH surge. Estrogen positive feedback may also involve estrogen-sensitive interneurons afferent to RP3V kisspeptin neurons.

rent may have on kisspeptin neurons. It is important to keep in mind, however, that $I_h$ is also gated by cyclic nucleotides and other second messengers, which shift its activation toward more depolarized potentials (Biel et al., 2009; Robinson and Siegelbaum, 2003). Neurotransmitters mobilizing these intracellular signaling pathways, combined with the upregulation of $I_h$ seen on proestrus, may therefore greatly influence the impact of this current in RP3V kisspeptin neurons at rest. Interestingly, daily increases in cyclic adenosine 3',5' monophosphate (cAMP) have been documented in the AVPV and may play a role in the generation of the LH surge (Chappell et al., 2000). It remains to be investigated whether or not this occurs in kisspeptin neurons.

In summary, electrophysiological studies have provided partial support for the “RP3V kisspeptin positive feedback theory”. While changes in firing have been observed following OVX, it has not been possible to observe acute changes in firing at the time of the GnRH/LH surge in the brain slice preparation (de Croft et al., 2012). In our experience, this parallels the situation for GnRH neurons where, using the same brain slice model, we have been unable to detect acute changes in GnRH neuron firing rates at the expected time of the GnRH/LH surge in brain slices (Liu & Herbison, unpublished). Nevertheless, the functioning of HCN and other channels in RP3V kisspeptin neurons is clearly modulated by circulating estradiol levels and are predicted to make these cells more excitable at the time of the surge. Given the proposed role of RP3V kisspeptin neurons as coincidence detectors of circadian and rising follicular phase estrogen cues, we suggest that one mechanism of estrogen positive feedback consists in the alteration of the ionic channel complement of RP3V kisspeptin neurons in order to ‘prepare’ these neurons to appropriately time the preovulatory surge (Fig. 6). As for the ARN kisspeptin neurons, it will be of great interest to monitor the electrical activity of RP3V kisspeptin neurons *in vivo*.

7.3. The GnRH pulse generator

As described in Section 3, ARN KNDy neurons appear to form a reciprocally interconnected network suspected to be part of the GnRH pulse generator. In this model, NKB and Dyn released from

not to kisspeptin (de Croft et al., 2013b) suggesting that these cells may not express functional Gpr54 receptors. In contrast GnRH neurons in slices are activated by kisspeptin but not by NKB (Navarro et al., 2011). Finally, as noted in Section 2.1, the actual pathway and mechanisms through which KNDy neurons regulate GnRH neurons remain unclear (Fig. 1), and this represents a key deficit in our understanding of the kisspeptin circuitry.

### 8. Conclusions and future directions

The recent development of kisspeptin-GFP mouse models has made it possible to efficiently interrogate the electrophysiological properties of kisspeptin neurons. With respect to their potential roles in the central control of fertility, these in vitro studies have thus far questioned the role of ARN kisspeptin neurons in the negative feedback pathway but provided some support for a role of RP3V kisspeptin neurons in the positive feedback mechanism. Brain slice electrophysiology has also confirmed some hypotheses regarding the roles of the neuropeptides co-expressed in ARN kisspeptin neurons. Future work will undoubtedly contribute to defining the role of ARN kisspeptin neurons in GnRH pulse generation. At the current stage, however, we know too little of the intrinsic properties of kisspeptin neurons and additional work will also be needed to paint a clearer picture of the roles of these neurons in various aspects of the control of fertility including their involvement in regulating GnRH pulsatile release, in mediating gonadal steroid feedback, and their potential sex differences. A major problem in achieving this goal is the high likelihood that the ARN and RP3V contain functionally heterogeneous sub-populations of kisspeptin neurons and targeting these different cell groups would appear to be a daunting challenge at this stage. In addition, virtually nothing is known of the neural networks connecting with kisspeptin neurons, although morphological studies point to several cell populations that may project to these neurons. Given that estrogen feedback may involve neural populations ‘upstream’ of kisspeptin neurons, a major future challenge will be to precisely identify, and functionally characterize, the specific synaptic inputs to the two kisspeptin neuron populations.
