The Ras branch of small GTPases: Ras family members don't fall far from the tree

Gary W Reuther* and Channing J Der†

The Ras branch of the Ras superfamily consists of small GTPases most closely related to Ras and include the R-Ras, Rap, Ral, Rheb, Rin and Rit proteins. Although our understanding of Ras signaling and biology is now considerable, recent observations suggest that Ras function is more complex than previously believed. First, the three Ras proteins may not be functionally identical. Second, Ras function involves functional cross-talk with their close relatives.

Ras proteins differ in their trafficking to, and
association with, the plasma membrane. Ras
proteins are synthesized initially as cytosolic
proteins. The carboxy-terminal CAAX (where
C is cysteine, A an aliphatic amino acid and X
is serine or methionine) tetrapeptide
sequence found on all Ras proteins is
recognized by the cytosolic
farnesyltransferase (FTase) enzyme, which
catalyzes the covalent addition of the C15
farnesyl isoprenoid lipid (F) to the

Overall sequence similarity between members of the Ras subfamily. The Ras subfamily dendrogram was generated by alignment of primary sequences using ClustalW, a dynamic sequence alignment program. From the resulting multiple sequence alignment, a distance matrix was prepared and used to construct the Ras dendrogram. The branch lengths are proportional to the estimated divergence along each branch. All sequences, except M-Ras, are of the human proteins. The Ras subfamily

Ras and R-Ras proteins may be coordinately activated by common extracellular signals. Three distinct Ras GEFs have been identified: SOS1/2, RasGRF1/2 and RasGRP. Growth factor (e.g. epidermal growth factor) stimulation of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) activation leads to the recruitment of the Grb2 adaptor, complexed to SOS, to the plasma membrane facilitating SOS activation of plasma membrane associated Ras.G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that signal through heterotrimeric G proteins consisting of αi and βγ subunits can activate Ras
Cross-talk between Ras subfamily members.
The interrelationship between Ras, Rap and Ral can be seen at multiple levels. First, the same G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) - and receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)-mediated activation signals can lead to their coordinate activation. For example, Ras and Rap1 may be activated by production of diacylglycerol (DAG), which in turn leads to activation of related GEFs that are specific for Ras (RasGRP) or Rap1 (CalDAG-GEF). Ras activation leads to signaling through the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway
Finally, whether Rheb can interact with other Ras effectors, and whether Rheb possesses its own effector targets, has not been determined.

While our knowledge on Rheb function in mammalian cells is limited, Rheb homologs have been identified in *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* (ScRheb) and *Schizosaccharomyces pombe* (SpRheb), where they appear to play a role in the regulation of arginine uptake [80]. A Rheb homolog has also been identified in *Drosophila* [80]. Invertebrate Rhebs also contain
to localize protein to the endomembrane system, and the second signal in
the Ras hypervariable region is required for transit to the plasma membrane.
It was also shown that H-Ras and K-Ras4B take slightly different routes to
the plasma membrane.
