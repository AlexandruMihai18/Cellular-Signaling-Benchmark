Blood glucose levels are maintained by the balance between glucose uptake by peripheral tissues and glucose secretion by the liver. Gluconeogenesis is strongly stimulated during fasting and is aberrantly activated in diabetes mellitus. Here we show that the transcriptional coactivator PGC-1 is strongly induced in liver in fasting mice and in three mouse models of insulin action deficiency: streptozotocin-induced diabetes, ob/ob genotype and liver insulin-receptor knockout. PGC-1 is induced synergistically in primary liver cultures by cyclic AMP and glucocorticoids. Adenoviral-mediated expression of PGC-1 in hepatocytes in culture or *in vivo* strongly activates an entire programme of key gluconeogenic enzymes, including phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and glucose-6-phosphatase, leading to increased glucose output. Full transcriptional activation of the PEPCK promoter requires coactivation of the glucocorticoid receptor and the liver-enriched transcription factor HNF-4α (hepatic nuclear factor-4α) by PGC-1. These results implicate PGC-1 as a key modulator of hepatic gluconeogenesis and as a central target of the insulin–cAMP axis in liver.

Mammalian cells use glucose as a major energy source; certain cell types such as neurons and red blood cells are especially dependent on glucose. Homeostatic mechanisms are in place to maintain blood glucose levels within a very narrow range, protecting the body against hypoglycaemia during periods of fasting and against excessively high levels following the ingestion of a high-carbohydrate meal. These goals are met chiefly through the hormonal modulation of the production of glucose by the liver and the peripheral uptake of glucose by skeletal muscle, heart muscle and fat.

The liver can produce glucose by breaking down glycogen (glycogenolysis) and by *de novo* synthesis of glucose from non-carbohydrate precursors such as lactate, pyruvate, glycerol and alanine (gluconeogenesis). Glycogenolysis occurs more rapidly, beginning within 2–3 h after a meal in humans, but gluconeogenesis assumes a much greater importance with prolonged fasting¹². The rate of gluconeogenesis is controlled principally by the activities of certain unidirectional enzymes, such as PEPCK, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase and glucose-6-phosphatase. The genes encoding these proteins are powerfully controlled at the transcriptional level by key hormones, particularly insulin, glucagon and glucocorticoids. In the fasted state and in untreated type 1 diabetes, insulin levels drop while glucagon secretion goes up and catecholamines and glucocorticoids remain stable, resulting in increased glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. In the fed state, insulin increases, suppressing glycogenolysis and hepatic glucose production³. In both type 1 and type 2 diabetes, excessive hepatic glucose production is a major contributor to both the fasting hyperglycaemia and the exaggerated postprandial hyperglycaemia.

We have previously described a coactivator of nuclear receptors and other transcription factors, PGC-1, which has a major role in cellular respiration and adaptive thermogenesis in tissues such as skeletal muscle and brown fat⁴⁵. PGC-1 is induced in muscle and brown fat by exposure of animals to cold; the induction of PGC-1 in brown fat in response to cold is a consequence of cAMP elevation

and is dependent on the β₃-adrenergic receptor⁴⁻⁷. These findings provided one of the first reported examples of a transcriptional coactivator linking external stimuli to a specific biological programme of gene regulation. This also raises questions about the role of PGC-1 in tissues where it is expressed but that are not thought to be active in thermogenesis.

Here, we show that PGC-1 is induced by cAMP and glucocorticoids in isolated hepatocytes and is strongly induced in the liver by fasting and other states of relative insulin deficiency. Furthermore, we show that PGC-1 can powerfully stimulate expression of key genes of the gluconeogenic pathway when expressed in isolated hepatocytes or in the liver of normal rats. These data strongly suggest that regulation of the transcriptional coactivator PGC-1 is of central importance in the control of gluconeogenesis by insulin and other hormones.

**Hormonal modulation of PGC-1 mRNA expression**

To study the potential role of PGC-1 in the regulation of liver gene expression by nutritional status, we examined mice subjected to fasting and refeeding. As expected, an overnight fast induced the expression of messenger RNA for the gluconeogenic proteins PEPCK and glucose-6-phosphatase (Fig. 1). HNF-4α, which is known to be involved in regulation of PEPCK⁸, was also induced. Fasting also induced a parallel 3.7-fold increase in PGC-1 mRNA. All of these inductions were reversed by refeeding (Fig. 1a).

We explored the temporal relationship between the induction of mRNAs for PGC-1 and gluconeogenesis, by performing a time course of fasting (Fig. 1b). An increase in PGC-1 mRNA was first observed after 2 h and peaked 5 h after food deprivation. Induction of PEPCK mRNA was also first detected at 2 h, increasing at 5 and 16 h. Thus, the induction of PGC-1 mRNA is a relatively early event, consistent with a possible role in control of gluconeogenic genes.

Given the known inducibility of PGC-1 in brown fat by β-adrenergic agonists acting through the cAMP system⁴⁻⁷ and that cAMP is known to rise in the liver during a fast, we investigated

PGC-1 mRNA is elevated in the livers of ob/ob mice compared with lean controls (Fig. 3b).

The liver-specific insulin-receptor knockout (LIRKO) mouse is a unique model of hepato-specific insulin resistance in the liver, and is associated with impaired glucose tolerance and the failure of insulin to suppress hepatic glucose production. As shown previously, LIRKO mice display increased levels of gluconeogenic gene transcripts in the liver, particularly for PEPCK and glucose-6-phosphatase. A striking elevation of PGC-1 in the livers of the null animals was consistently detected relative to the lox/lox controls, correlating well with the expression of gluconeogenic genes in these animals (Fig. 3c). The differences between the knockout and control mice was most apparent in the fed and refed states, although it was still apparent in the fasted state. These data suggest that PGC-1 expression, like gluconeogenesis itself, is suppressed by the action of the insulin receptor.

**Figure 1** PGC-1 gene expression is regulated by nutritional status. **a**, Male mice were divided into three experimental groups. The first two groups were either allowed to feed *ad libitum* (lane 1) or subjected to a 24-h fast (lane 2). The third group was subjected to a 24-h fast followed by 24 h of feeding (lane 3), and killed. Ten micrograms of total RNA extracted from pooled liver tissue (*n* = 3 per group) was analysed by northern blotting.

whether PGC-1 is induced by a cAMP analogue in primary hepatocytes. Cells were treated with 8-bromo-cAMP, dexamethasone or a combination. Whereas dexamethasone produced little increase in the PGC-1 mRNA, treatment with 8-bromo-cAMP caused a large increase in the PGC-1 transcript. Interestingly, the combination of 8-bromo-cAMP and dexamethasone had a synergistic effect (Fig. 2). This is of particular interest as glucocorticoids also rise during the fasted state.

**PGC-1 mRNA is high in insulin-deficient mice**

Although gluconeogenic genes are induced in liver by cAMP and glucocorticoids, the dominant regulator of gluconeogenesis *in vivo* is insulin. We first examined the levels of PGC-1 mRNA in the livers of mice treated with streptozotocin, which is the most commonly used experimental model of insulin-deficient type 1 diabetes. PGC-1 mRNA is consistently elevated in the liver of these mice (Fig. 3a).

Mice homozygous for the obesity (*ob*) gene are obese, severely insulin resistant and widely used as a model of type 2 diabetes.

**Figure 2** PGC-1 gene expression is induced in cultured hepatocytes by treatment with gluconeogenic hormones. Primary hepatocytes were cultured in serum-free DMEM and incubated with vehicle (lane 2), 1 μM dexamethasone (dex, lane 1), 1 mM 8-bromo-cAMP (lane 4), or dexamethasone and 8-bromo-cAMP (lane 3). Total RNA was isolated from cells 6–8 h after the initiation of treatment and was subjected to northern analysis (10 μg per lane).

**Figure 3** PGC-1 gene expression is increased in the livers of insulin-deficient animals. Northern analysis was performed on the total RNA (10 μg per lane) isolated from the liver tissues removed from the animals. **a**, Regulation of PGC-1 in streptozotocin (STZ)-diabetic mice. Male mice of 6–8 weeks old received intraperitoneal injections daily with sodium citrate solution (control group) or streptozotocin (100 μg per g body mass) for 3 d. After 10 d, the animals (*n* = 3 per group) were killed. Total RNA was isolated from the liver and analysed. **b**, Regulation of PGC-1 in liver of *ob/ob* mice. Three-month-old male *ob/ob* or lean littermates fed *ad libitum* were killed and RNA was extracted from the liver. **c**, Regulation of PGC-1 in LIRKO mice. Two-month-old female control (lox/lox) or LIRKO mice were subjected to *ad libitum* feeding, a 24-h fast, or a 24-h fast and 24 h of refeeding. They were then killed and liver tissue was extracted.

Expression of PGC-1 increases glucose output

To address the possibility that PGC-1 may regulate aspects of hepatic glucose metabolism, PGC-1 was expressed in primary rat hepatocytes with an adenovirus-based vector. PGC-1 expression at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 60 markedly increased the mRNAs that encode several key gluconeogenic enzymes (Fig. 4a). These included PEPCK and glucose-6-phosphatase, which catalyse the first committed and the terminal steps of the gluconeogenic pathway, respectively. Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase mRNA was also elevated several-fold. Glucocorticoids caused an additional induction of gluconeogenic genes in cells receiving PGC-1.

This regulation of gluconeogenic genes is dose-dependent with respect to PGC-1. A significant increase in target gene expression was detected when the hepatocytes were infected at an MOI of 5 (Fig. 4b), and expression of these genes reached a plateau at an MOI of 60. These adenovirus titres resulted in physiological levels of PGC-1 protein: as shown in Fig. 4c, an MOI of 60 resulted in a level of PGC-1 that approaches but does not exceed the level present in fasted liver. Thus, elevation of PGC-1 stimulated the expression of gluconeogenic genes in the physiological range of this coactivator.

We next examined whether the expression of PGC-1 enhances the net glucose production by primary hepatocytes. Measurements of the glucose released into the culture medium, which initially contained gluconeogenic precursors but no glucose, indicate that the expression of PGC-1 (MOI of 60) by itself is sufficient to increase the glucose production threefold in the absence of any exogenous hormonal stimulation (Fig. 5). The addition of 8-bromo-cAMP did not further enhance this response, which is consistent with the notion that the induction of PGC-1 is the major function of cAMP in this process. Taken together, these data demonstrate that PGC-1, at physiological concentrations, promotes hepatic output of glucose through the transcriptional regulation of the gluconeogenic enzymes.

Primary hepatocytes were maintained in DMEM with 10% FBS and at 48 h after plating were infected with control adenovirus expressing GFP or an adenoviral vector expressing both GFP and PGC-1 at an MOI of 60. This titre was sufficient to achieve an infection rate of >90%, as determined by GFP fluorescence.

gluconeogenic enzyme PEPCK have been extensively studied²¹¹. The activity of this enzyme, which catalyses the first committed step of gluconeogenesis, is regulated primarily at the transcriptional level by a number of hormones, particularly glucagon (via cAMP), glucocorticoids and insulin. Regulatory units, each composed of several DNA-binding elements, have been identified for each of the hormones⁸,¹¹⁻¹⁶. For example, the glucocorticoid response element is composed of transcription factor binding sites (gAF1, gAF2, gAF3) and each of these is necessary for a full hormone-mediated transcriptional response (Fig. 6a; ref. 17). Two relatively weak binding sites exist for the glucocorticoid receptor. However, assigning cAMP and insulin responsiveness of this promoter to the function of a particular transcriptional component has been particularly difficult.

We examined the ability of PGC-1 to activate the gene promoter for PEPCK in hepatoma cells. The Fao cell line is a well differentiated rat hepatoma cell line that possesses an active gluconeogenic pathway. In the absence of exogenous hormones, PGC-1 robustly activates the wild-type PEPCK gene promoter, increasing transcription by about tenfold (Fig. 6a). To identify the regulatory elements mediating this effect of PGC-1, mutant constructs were used in which various regulatory elements within the PEPCK gene promoter were converted to a yeast Gal4 DNA-binding element¹⁸. As reported previously, mutations in the gAF elements do not affect the basal reporter activity. However, a mutation of gAF1 and/or gAF3 sites reduced the PGC-1-mediated activation by about 60%. In contrast, a mutation in the gAF2 or the CRE site did not appreciably affect the magnitude of the activation. These results imply that the interactions between PGC-1 and the factors at the gAF1 and gAF3 sites are quantitatively important in the regulation of PEPCK, although other important interactions must also exist.

The gAF1 and gAF3 sites are both DR-1 type sequences that can bind several nuclear receptors. Using hepatocyte extracts, the gAF1 element has previously been shown to bind the proteins HNF-4α and COUP-TF, both orphan nuclear receptors⁸,¹⁷. The gAF3 element has also been associated with COUP-TF binding¹⁵. When a Gal4-HNF-4α construct encoding the Gal4 DNA-binding domain (DBD) fused to the ligand binding or transactivation domain of

the HNF-4α gene was cotransfected with the gAF1 or gAF3 mutant or the gAF1/gAF3 double-mutant PEPCK constructs, full PGC-1 activity was restored (Fig. 6b). In contrast, cotransfection of a Gal4-COUP-TF construct produced only a very small effect. Cotransfection of the Gal4 DBD alone had virtually no effect on the PGC-1-mediated activation. Very similar results were obtained at the gAF3 site (data not shown). These data suggest that the coactivation of HNF-4α by PGC-1 through the gAF1 element (and probably the gAF3 element) constitute a major mechanism of control at this promoter.

To examine these functional interactions at the gAF1 site with intact transcription factors, we performed reporter gene assays using PGC-1, wild-type HNF-4α and COUP-TF proteins, and a multimerized gAF1 response element. To avoid interference with endogenous liver factors, these experiments were done in 3T3 cells. Neither HNF-4α, COUP-TF nor PGC-1 activates these target sequences alone (Fig. 6c). Although PGC-1 has no ability to coactivate COUP-TF, it dramatically coactivates HNF-4α without addition of any hormone or HNF-4α ligand.

Finally, we examined the role of the glucocorticoid response elements in the PEPCK gene promoter. PGC-1 has previously been shown to bind to and coactivate the glucocorticoid receptor in a ligand-dependent manner¹⁹. PGC-1 coactivates the PEPCK promoter through the glucocorticoid receptor also in a ligand-dependent manner (Fig. 6d). This effect is substantially reduced by mutation at the glucocorticoid receptor-1 (GR-1) site, but not the GR-2 site, consistent with previous data indicating a more important regulatory role for the GR-1 site¹⁵.

**Interaction with HNF-4α requires an LXXLL motif**

Co-immunoprecipitation experiments were carried out with whole-cell extracts. A Flag-tagged PGC-1 expression construct was transfected into BOSC23 cells with or without HNF-4α. Immunoprecipitation with anti-Flag antibodies coupled to agarose beads contained significant amounts of the HNF-4α protein as assessed by western blot analysis, but only when both PGC-1 and HNF-4α were transfected (Fig. 7a). This indicates that PGC-1 can indeed form a complex with HNF-4α in cells.

We also performed a series of *in vitro* interaction studies to localize the key domains required for the interaction between PGC-1 and HNF-4α. Using [³⁵S]-labelled *in vitro* translations of HNF-4α and glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins of PGC-1, we found that the amino-terminal 190 amino acids of PGC-1 are sufficient to mediate a strong interaction with HNF-4α, with a recovery of greater than 50% of the input (Fig. 7b). This region of PGC-1 has previously been shown to mediate ligand-dependent interactions with the activation function-2 (AF-2) domains of several nuclear receptors, including oestrogen receptor-α (ERα), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPARα) and glucocorticoid receptor¹⁹⁻²¹. In contrast, PGC-1 interacts with PPARγ in a ligand-independent fashion *in vitro* via PGC-1 amino acids 338–403 (ref. 4).

Because the LXXLL sequence present at amino acids 142–146 of PGC-1 is required for the binding of PGC-1 to other receptors such as ERα and PPARα, we also tested a mutant construct of PGC-1 (1–190 deletion) in which the LXXLL sequence was mutated. This mutation largely eliminated the binding of PGC-1 to HNF-4α, identifying this motif as a critical mediator of the physical interaction between PGC-1 and HNF-4α. To determine whether the loss of ability of the LXXLL mutant to bind HNF-4α was a specific effect or due to a general loss of proper protein folding, we investigated whether this mutant could still interact with the coactivator SRC-1. The ability to interact with SRC-1 (ref. 22) is unaltered in this mutant (Fig. 7b), suggesting that the PGC-1–HNF-4α association is indeed mediated specifically by the LXXLL motif.

LXXLL motifs in coactivators of nuclear receptors have been shown to interact with the carboxy-terminal AF-2 domains on the

Primary hepatocytes were infected with GFP- or PGC-1-expressing adenovirus and were subsequently cultured in serum-free DMEM with or without 1 mM cAMP treatment.

Results shown are normalized to the total cell protein content determined from cell lysates.
receptors. A C-terminal-deleted HNF-4α gene lacking the AF-2 domain expressed HNF-4α with no ability to bind to PGC-1 (Fig. 7c). Thus, these data strongly suggest that the interaction between PGC-1 and HNF-4α is mediated by the LXXLL-AF-2 interaction, an interaction that does not require the addition of an exogenous HNF-4α ligand.

### PGC-1 alters gluconeogenesis in vivo

The studies described above were performed with cultured cells; a crucial question is whether elevation of PGC-1 levels could activate gluconeogenesis in vivo. We used adenoviral vectors to examine this. Systemic infusion of recombinant adenoviruses into rats through the tail vein has been shown to result primarily in expression of transgenes in the liver, with no detectable expression in peripheral tissues such as muscle, fat, kidney or brain^{23,24}. Viruses containing the cDNA encoding PGC-1 (CMV-PGC-1 adenovirus) or green fluorescent protein (CMV-GFP adenovirus) were infused into normal Wistar rats. Five days after virus administration, rats fed ad libitum were killed during the day for collection of liver and blood samples. Assays of blood aspartate aminotransferase activity ensured that there was no hepatotoxicity evident in these experiments. Immunoblot analysis revealed that animals who received the CMV-PGC-1 adenovirus had an average increase in PGC-1 protein of 260% relative to animals infused with CMV-GFP. The PGC-1 level in these fed rats was about equal to the levels observed in fasted animals (representative blot shown in Fig. 8a).

CMV-GFP-infused control rats had blood glucose levels of 0.79 ± 0.06 mg ml⁻¹ (mean ± s.d.) and insulin levels of 0.27 ± 0.03 ng ml⁻¹. In contrast, rats receiving the CMV-PGC-1 adenovirus had glucose levels of 1.10 ± 0.03 mg ml⁻¹, a 39% increase (*P* = 0.00028), and 0.43 ± 0.05 ng ml⁻¹ of insulin, a 66% increase (*P* = 0.0139) (Fig. 8b). Elevated glucose and a compensatory increase of insulin are hallmarks of increased hepatic glucose output in non-diabetic animals; these data closely match what has been observed on overexpression of PEPCK²⁵ or the catalytic subunit of glucose-6-phosphatase²⁶ in liver of normal rodents by transgenic and adenoviral methods.

To investigate correlative changes in gene expression in the liver, mRNA levels were examined by northern blotting. The ectopic PGC-1 expression resulted in a dramatic and uniform elevation in mRNA for glucose-6-phosphate, reaching levels equivalent to those observed in fasted animals (Fig. 8a). There was also an increased expression of PEPCK mRNA, although one control rat also had elevated PEPCK mRNA. These data together show that modulation of PGC-1 levels in the physiological range promotes expression of the gluconeogenesis genes and changes in glucose homeostasis.

#### Discussion

Precise regulation of gluconeogenesis is required for the physiological adaptation to fasting and starvation. Carried out mainly in

the liver, gluconeogenesis enables the organism to maintain relatively steady circulating glucose levels, providing glucose for tissues dependent on this fuel, particularly the brain. Gluconeogenesis is also a particularly important pathological component of type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The critical role of insulin in suppressing gluconeogenesis and hepatic glucose output is reflected by the fact that excessive hepatic glucose output is a feature of poorly treated diabetes. Increased hepatic glucose output is primarily responsible for fasting hyperglycaemia in diabetes and is a major component of post-prandial hyperglycaemia. Insulin controls hepatic glucose output in significant measure by counteracting the actions of glucagon and catecholamines in the liver. Although these hormones function in gluconeogenesis largely at the transcriptional level, the specific transcription factors targeted by these hormones have been elusive despite considerable experimentation. We show here that a major target of these hormones is the transcriptional coactivator PGC-1.

PGC-1 is induced strongly in primary liver cells by a cAMP analogue and to a lesser extent by a glucocorticoid. However, dexamethasone dramatically increases the cAMP-induced induction of PGC-1. PGC-1 is induced *in vivo* in several states that have been tightly associated with gluconeogenesis—fasting, streptozotocin-induced type 1 diabetes and obesity-linked type 2 diabetes. These all involve a relative insulin deficiency along with an increase in the counter-regulatory hormones glucagon and catecholamines. The dominant effect of insulin in suppressing hepatic gluconeogenesis has been shown definitively by the very marked elevation of PGC-1 that occurs in the LIRKO mouse<sup>10</sup>. PGC-1 is powerfully induced in the livers of these animals. Although this suggests that the PGC-1 induction occurs through the loss of insulin action in the liver *per se*, these animals also show systemic dysfunction<sup>10</sup>. Therefore, indirect actions of insulin cannot be excluded. Recent data have shown important roles for Akt<sup>27</sup> and forkhead transcription factor<sup>28</sup> in insulin suppression of hepatic gluconeogenesis; whether these components are involved in the regulation of PGC-1 gene expression remains to be determined.

That this rise in PGC-1 is causally linked to the induction of gluconeogenesis is illustrated by experiments in which PGC-1 is expressed in primary hepatocytes and rat liver. In hormone-free conditions that minimize endogenous PGC-1 expression in primary hepatocytes, exogenous PGC-1 induced the entire programme of gluconeogenic genes. mRNA for PEPCK, the initial committed

After 5 d, animals fed *ad libitum* were killed. Livers were collected and analysed for PGC-1 protein and mRNA for PEPCK and glucose-6-phosphatase.

step of this pathway, as well as mRNAs for glucose-6-phosphatase
and fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, were powerfully induced from
essentially undetectable levels, in a PGC-1-dose-dependent fashion.
The induction of gluconeogenic genes in the primary hepatic
cultures resulted in increased glucose secretion. The secretion rate
induced by PGC-1 was fully equal to that obtained by cAMP
stimulation of cells; cAMP also had no further effect on the glucose
secretion rates of cells that contained ectopically expressed PGC-1.
Adenoviral-mediated expression of PGC-1 in the liver of rats
induced a mild hyperglycaemia and elevation of insulin. This is
almost exactly what has been previously observed when hepatic
glucose output was activated through adenoviral expression of the
gluconeogenic enzymes in rodents^{29,30}. Importantly, the changes in
expression of gluconeogenic genes were not a consequence of gross
overexpression of PGC-1, because the level of ectopic PGC-1
protein obtained in both *in vitro* and *in vivo* studies was equal to
that observed in the fasted liver. Taken together, these data indicate
that PGC-1 is a major target of the insulin–cAMP axis in inducing
hepatic gluconeogenesis.

Because PGC-1 is a transcriptional coactivator, the transcription
factor targets of PGC-1 involved in gluconeogenic genes are of
considerable importance. PGC-1 powerfully coactivates the PEPCK
gene promoter in cotransfection assays and functions prominently
through the gAF1 and gAF3 sites, apparently through an interaction
with HNF-4α. Reassembly of HNF-4α, but not of COUP-TF, onto
the PEPCK gene promoter completely restores PGC-1 coactivation.
PGC-1 could also coactivate HNF-4α through multimers of its
cognate DBDs via direct protein–protein interactions. These data
point to a very critical role for HNF-4α in PGC-1 action at gAF1,
which also binds COUP-TF and PPARγ. The gAF3 site has been
shown to bind COUP-TF, PPARα and HNF-4α. PPARα is enriched
in the liver, is induced in fasting and has been shown previously to
be powerfully coactivated by PGC-1. Hence, both PPARα and HNF-
4α are likely to be targets for PGC-1 at AF-3. It is also clear from
these mutation data, particularly the fact that a double gAF1/gAF3
mutant can still show partial coactivation by PGC-1, that other
factors must be important even under these hormone-free condi-
tions. A role for PGC-1 in coactivating the glucocorticoid receptor
at glucocorticoid response elements also seems clear.

A function for HNF-4α in linking PGC-1 to gluconeogenesis is
particularly interesting. Gluconeogenesis is a process that takes
place primarily in the liver, so the prominent coactivation of the
highly liver-enriched HNF-4α by PGC-1 may serve to tie glucose
production to this tissue. From the transcriptional perspective, it is
interesting that HNF-4α has been found previously to be quite
active even in the absence of added ligand. Indeed, the nature of the
endogenous ligand for this receptor is unclear. However, PGC-1 can
powerfully coactivate HNF-4α in the absence of added ligand. PGC-1
docks on HNF-4α using the LXXLL motif in the N terminus of
PGC-1 and the AF-2 domains of the HNF-4α gene. Both of these
motifs are typically associated with ligand-induced docking on
coactivators on nuclear receptors^{31}, strongly suggesting that HNF-
4α is either constitutively in a configuration that is similar to what
for most receptors is a ligand-induced state, or that an HNF-4α
ligand is nearly ubiquitous in biological fluids. The former seems
more likely.

The suppression of gluconeogenesis and hepatic glucose output
remains a very attractive therapeutic target in diabetes. The anti-
diabetic drug metformin is thought to work through the suppres-
sion of hepatic glucose output^{32}, but very little is known about its
mechanism. Suppressing PGC-1 function in the liver without
compromising its effects in other non-gluconeogenic tissues such
as brown fat and muscle could yield medically significant anti-
diabetic effects. Whereas the development of liver-selective inhibi-
tors of PGC-1 *per se* might be possible, the development of an
inhibitor of the PGC-1–HNF-4α interaction may be more imme-
diately feasible.

### Methods

#### Cell culture
Primary rat hepatocytes were purchased from In Vitro Technologies and cultured in
DMEM with 10% FBS at 5% CO₂. Cells were incubated in serum-free DMEM overnight
before addition of hormones. FaO rat hepatoma cells were maintained in RPMI 1640
medium with 10% FBS at 5% CO₂.

#### Animal experiments
Male mice were either allowed free access to food or subjected to a 24-h fast before
being killed. A third group was fasted for 24 h and then allowed to feed *ad libitum* for
another 24 h before being killed. For the fasting time-course experiment, mice were fed
*ad libitum* or fasted during the dark period for 2, 5 and 16 h. For the streptozotocin-
diabetic mouse experiments, 6–8-week-old male mice (*n* = 3 per group) were injected
intraperitoneally for 3 d consecutively with either sodium citrate solution or streptozo-
tocin (100 μg per g body mass). Animals were killed after 10 d, at which point the mean
blood glucose in the streptozotocin-treated group rose to >4 mg ml⁻¹. Littermate ob/ob
and control male mice (Jackson) were killed at 3 months old. For the LIRKO mouse
experiments, 2-month-old female control (*lox/lox*) or LIRKO mice were divided into three
groups (*n* = 2 each) and subjected to the feeding–fasting protocol described above.

#### Adenovirus infection
Primary hepatocytes were infected 48 h after plating with adenoviruses expressing either
GFP or PGC-1 (ref. 33). Cells were collected for RNA or protein isolation 48–72 h after
infection. Glucose production assays were performed 48 h after infection.

#### Glucose production assay
Primary hepatocytes were cultured in six-well plates (1.4 × 10⁶ cells per well) in DMEM
with 10% FBS or, in case of hormonal treatments, in serum-free DMEM. The medium was
then replaced with 1 ml of glucose production buffer consisting of glucose-free DMEM
(pH 7.4), without phenol red, supplemented with 20 mM sodium lactate and 2 mM
sodium pyruvate. After a 3-h incubation, 0.5 ml of medium was collected and the
glucose concentration measured with a colorimetric glucose assay kit (Sigma). The
readings were then normalized to the total protein content determined from the
whole-cell lysates.

#### Western blot analysis
Whole-cell extracts were prepared by lysing the cells in a buffer containing 100 mM Tris
buffer (pH 8.5), 250 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 1 mM EDTA, protease inhibitors (Boehringer
Mannheim), and 0.1% phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride, and were centrifuged at 14,000g
for 10 min to remove cellular debris. Tissue extracts were prepared by homogenization in
the lysis buffer with a Polytron homogenizer, followed by centrifugation to remove
particulate matter. Proteins were separated by SDS–PAGE, transferred to Immobilon P
membranes (Millipore), and probed with an affinity-purified antibody directed against
murine PGC-1.

#### Transcriptional activation assays
NIH 3T3 fibroblasts or FAO hepatoma cells were transiently transfected in six-well dishes
at 80–90% by FuGene (Roche). The ratio of DNA : FuGene was 1 : 2. Culture medium was
changed after 24 h. Cells were collected 48 h after transfection and β-galactosidase and
luciferase assays were performed. Transfections were performed in duplicate and repeated
at least twice.

#### Co-immunoprecipitation experiments
Flag-tagged PGC-1 and/or HNF-4α was transfected into BOSC23 cells using FuGene
(Roche). Whole-cell lysates, prepared 48 h after transfection, were subjected to an
overnight incubation with a monoclonal antibody to Flag (Sigma) linked to agarose
beads^{22}. The immunoprecipitates were washed extensively with lysis buffer, separated by
SDS–PAGE, and immunoblotted using antibodies directed against PGC-1 and HNF-4α
(Santa Cruz).

#### Protein interaction assays
GST fusion proteins produced in Escherichia coli were purified on beads containing
glutathione. [³⁵S]-labelled HNF-4α was produced with a TNT reticulocyte lysate *in vitro*
transcription and translation kit (Promega). About 1 μg of fusion protein was mixed with
5 μl of the *in vitro* translate in a binding buffer containing 20 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.7),
75 mM KCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 2.5 mM MgCl₂, 0.05% NP40, 2 mM dithiothreitol and 10%
glycerol. Binding was performed for 1 h at room temperature and the beads were then
washed four times with the binding buffer and resuspended in SDS–PAGE sample buffer.
After electrophoresis, the [³⁵S]-labelled proteins were detected by autoradiography.

#### Adenovirus infusions and metabolic measurements
Male Wistar rats (Charles River) were fed with standard laboratory food and weighed
300–350 g at the time of the studies. Animals were anaesthetized by injection of 0.1 ml per
100 g body mass of a solution containing 25 mg ml⁻¹ of ketamine (Fort Dodge Animal
Health), 2.5 mg ml⁻¹ of xylazine (Phoenix Scientific) and 0.5 mg ml⁻¹ of acepromazine
(Fermenta Animal Health). CMV-GFP and CMV-PGC-1 adenoviruses were purified
by CsCl gradient centrifugation as described^{30}. Pure recombinant virus (1 × 10¹²)

plaque-forming units), suspended in 0.5 ml of PBS, was injected into anaesthetized rats through the tail vein. Animals were allowed to recover and were fed standard food *ad libitum*. Five days after adenovirus infusion, tail vein blood was collected at 14:00 for measurement of glucose concentration, using a β-glucose analyser (HemoCue AB). After the measurement, animals were killed. Blood samples were collected from the heart, centrifuged at 1,300g for 15 min at 4°C in 15-ml centrifuge tubes containing 50 μl of 0.4 M EDTA, and stored at –20°C before measurement of insulin concentrations with a rat-insulin-specific radioimmunoassay kit (Linco Research). Liver samples were collected, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80°C. Aliquots of frozen liver samples were processed for northern blot or immunoblot analysis.
