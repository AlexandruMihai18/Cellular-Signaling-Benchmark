METHOTREXATE, a folic acid antagonist, is used extensively not only for the treatment of cancer but also for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, and autoimmune disease and for the prevention of graft-versus-host disease after transplantation. The drug is also used as an abortifacient. Other folate antagonists are used to treat bacterial infections (trimethoprim), malaria (pyrimethamine), and *Pneumocystis carinii* infection (trimetrexate with leucovorin). As with other drugs used to treat infectious diseases or cancers, the development of resistance limits the effectiveness of these folate antagonists. An understanding of the mechanisms of resistance to this class of drugs is important for their optimal use, as well as for the development of new drugs.

The recent application of new and sensitive molecular biologic techniques has made it possible to study the genetic alterations underlying the phenotypic changes associated with acquired resistance to methotrexate in tumor tissue. Methotrexate is an important component of the treatment of acute lymphocytic leukemia, which can be cured in about 70 percent of children. The mechanisms of acquired resistance to the drug have been studied in patients with relapses of acute lymphocytic leukemia. In contrast, methotrexate is ineffective in the treatment of acute myelocytic leukemia, and mechanisms of intrinsic resistance to the drug have been examined in patients with this type of leukemia. Here, we review the current understanding of resistance to methotrexate in patients with leukemia. The drug’s mechanisms of action and its therapeutic use are reviewed in detail elsewhere.

### MECHANISMS OF ACTION

The enzyme dihydrofolate reductase is the target for the action of methotrexate (Fig. 1). Methotrexate and its polyglutamate forms are potent competitive inhibitors of this enzyme; in addition, methotrexate polyglutamates inhibit two enzymes in the purine synthetic pathway that require folate coenzymes. As a consequence of the inhibition of dihydrofolate reductase, the regeneration of tetrahydrofolate from dihydrofolate is impaired, leading to a deficiency of tetrahydrofolate and its one-carbon–adduct derivatives in replicating cells. Lack of tetrahydrofolate leads to an impairment of both purine and thymidine synthesis, an inhibition of DNA replication, and cell death. Cells in which enzymes are inhibited by toxic concentrations of methotrexate are characteristically megaloblastic, as a consequence of the impairment of DNA synthesis, whereas RNA and protein synthesis are less affected. Cell death caused by methotrexate is dependent on the duration of inhibition of the enzyme, the level of reduction in folates in the cell, and the presence of other factors that inhibit apoptosis—for example, mutant p53 gene products, an absence of retinoblastoma gene products, or an increase in the expression of the *bcl-2* gene.

Other determinants of the action of methotrexate are its concentration and persistence, its rate of influx into cells, the extent of polyglutamylation (Fig. 1A), and the rate of hydrolysis of polyglutamates to methotrexate and, thus, its rate of efflux (Fig. 1B). The influx of methotrexate is mediated by the folate carrier protein, which transports reduced folates and methotrexate into cells more efficiently than folic acid. Most cells have a second, low-capacity transport system for folates and methotrexate. This system, which involves a membrane-bound folate receptor, does not appear to play a part in resistance to methotrexate.

Like folate coenzymes, methotrexate is extensively polyglutamylated by some tumor cells—that is, additional glutamates (up to five) are added sequentially by the enzyme folylpolyglutamate synthase (tetrahydrofolylpolyglutamate synthase). Methotrexate polyglutamates are retained longer in cells than is methotrexate; thus, the amount accumulated and the length of the chain of methotrexate polyglutamates are important determinants of cytotoxicity.

**Figure 1. Metabolism and Action of Methotrexate (MTX) in Mammalian Cells.**

Panel A shows the uptake of methotrexate, which is mediated by the reduced folate carrier (green) (reaction 1) and by an endocytic pathway activated by a folate receptor (blue) (reaction 2). Once inside the cell, methotrexate is polyglutamylated by the enzyme folylpolyglutamate synthase (reaction 3). Both methotrexate and its polyglutamates (Glu) are potent inhibitors of dihydrofolate reductase, an enzyme that converts dihydrofolate (FH₂) to tetrahydrofolate (FH₄) (reaction 4). With the depletion of tetrahydrofolate, thymidylate (TMP) synthesis (reaction 5) and subsequently DNA synthesis are inhibited. Methotrexate polyglutamates inhibit purine biosynthesis both directly and by inhibiting tetrahydrofolate formation (reaction 6).

Panel B shows the intracellular hydrolysis of methotrexate polyglutamates. Methotrexate polyglutamates are transported into lysosomes and hydrolyzed to monoglutamates by folylpolyglutamate (FPG) hydrolase (reaction 7). TTP denotes thymidine triphosphate, dUMP deoxyuridine monophosphate, and CH₂FH₄ methylenetetrahydrofolate.

Once formed within the cell, methotrexate polyglutamates, like the polyglutamate forms of the folate coenzymes, are slowly metabolized. This process is achieved by the active transport of methotrexate polyglutamates into lysosomes,¹⁶ hydrolysis by folylpolyglutamate hydrolase (γ-glutamyl hydrolase, or γ-Glu-X carboxypeptidase), and efflux of the monoglutamate form of methotrexate from the lysosomes and the cells (Fig. 1B).

### MECHANISMS OF RESISTANCE TO METHOTREXATE

Resistance to methotrexate may occur as a result of changes in the transport of methotrexate, its polyglutamylation, its interaction with dihydrofolate reductase, or the breakdown of methotrexate polyglutamates (Fig. 1 and Table 1).

In both in vitro and in vivo studies, exposure to increasing doses of methotrexate kills the majority of tumor cells and therefore selects for the survival of resistant cells. The mechanisms by which some cells survive include an increase in dihydrofolate reductase activity and a reduction in the influx of methotrexate. Increased enzyme activity is almost always a result of amplification of the gene for dihydrofolate reductase.¹⁷,¹⁸ Reduced influx results from decreases in the amount or function of the reduced folate carrier.¹⁹⁻²¹ Acquired resistance to methotrexate may also result from a decrease in the intracellular concentrations of polyglutamylated forms of methotrexate.

ate or from mutations in dihydrofolate reductase that cause a decreased affinity for the drug.²²-²⁴

Methotrexate-resistant cell lines with a decreased ability to form polyglutamates have also been described.²⁵ This type of resistance is dependent on timing — that is, cells with this phenotype are resistant to methotrexate during short-term exposure (24 hours or less) but not during prolonged exposure.²⁵ A decreased accumulation of methotrexate polyglutamate in cells can also be due to an increased breakdown associated with an increase in the activity of the lysosomal enzyme folylpolyglutamyl hydrolase.²⁶,²⁷

Mutations in dihydrofolate reductase leading to a decreased binding of methotrexate or methotrexate polyglutamate to the enzyme have also been noted in tumors.²²,²³ These mutations, with one exception,²⁴ have involved hydrophobic amino acids in the folate-binding region of the enzyme. Whereas mutated dihydrofolate reductase is a relatively uncommon cause of tumor-cell resistance, resistance to the folate antagonist pyrimethamine in the treatment of malarial parasites is often associated with mutations in the dihydrofolate reductase gene.²⁸ These mutations have made methotrexate ineffective as prophylaxis against malaria in many regions.

ACQUIRED RESISTANCE  
TO METHOTREXATE

An assay using a fluorescent lysine analogue of methotrexate, *N*-(4-amino-4-deoxy-*N*¹⁰-methylpteroyl)-*N*⁶-(4′fluorescein thiocarbamyl)-L-lysine (PT-430), has proved to be a sensitive method for detecting a decrease in the cellular uptake of methotrexate.²⁹ Among 35 patients with untreated acute lymphocytic leukemia, the percentage of displacement of PT-430 with methotrexate or trimetrexate was substantial (Fig. 2). In contrast, among 27 patients with relapses of acute lymphocytic leukemia considered to be resistant to methotrexate, 52 percent had less than 30 percent displacement, indicating that decreased transport is a common mechanism of acquired resistance to methotrexate. In cells from patients with newly diagnosed acute myelocytic leukemia, displacement of PT-430 with methotrexate and trimetrexate was variable. In cells from some of the patients, displacement with trimetrexate was minimal, suggesting that the cells would be resistant to treatment with this drug. These cells may express increased levels of P-glycoprotein, a cell membrane protein that mediates the efflux of drugs involved in multidrug resistance and that has been found in leukemic cells from both patients with newly diagnosed acute myelocytic leukemia and those with relapses.³⁰

With the availability of complementary DNA (cDNA) for the reduced folate carrier, the molecular basis for the decreased uptake of methotrexate in blast cells from patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia can now be determined.¹⁹-²¹ Preliminary data show a correlation between low levels of expression of the reduced folate carrier and decreased uptake of methotrexate, as measured by the PT-430 assay.³¹

Resistance to methotrexate in mouse, hamster, and human cell lines exposed to increasing methotrexate concentrations is associated with increased synthesis of dihydrofolate reductase and a proportional increase in the numbers of dihydrofolate reductase gene copies.¹⁷,¹⁸ On the basis of several case reports of gene amplification in methotrexate-resistant tumors from patients,²² we used a sensitive DNA dot blot assay to analyze leukemic blasts from 29 patients with relapses of acute lymphocytic leukemia

The New England Journal of Medicine

approximately 20 to 30 percent of patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia in relapse.³²

Matherly et al. analyzed the amount and heterogeneity of dihydrofolate reductase expression in blast cells from patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia at the time of diagnosis and at the time of relapse.³³ At the time of diagnosis, 7 of 19 patients (37 percent) had dual populations of blast cells, with one population having high levels of dihydrofolate reductase, as measured by PT-430 fluorescence. The duration of remission was shorter in patients with dual populations of blast cells than in those with a single population (P = 0.04).

To determine whether mutations in dihydrofolate reductase occur in patients with leukemia, we tested blast cells from 22 patients for alterations in the binding of methotrexate to dihydrofolate reductase. We also sequenced the cDNA for dihydrofolate reductase in blast cells from eight patients: six with acute lymphocytic leukemia (four with relapses and two with untreated disease) and two with untreated acute myelocytic leukemia (unpublished observations). We did not detect decreased methotrexate binding at the protein level or alterations in the coding region of dihydrofolate reductase in any of these samples. It thus seems unlikely that mutations in dihydrofolate reductase are a common mechanism of acquired resistance in patients with acute leukemia.

## INTRINSIC RESISTANCE TO METHOTREXATE

Comparisons of leukemic blast cells from patients with untreated acute myelocytic leukemia considered to be intrinsically resistant to methotrexate treatment and from patients with the common type of acute lymphocytic leukemia in children (pre-B cell, as determined by surface markers) provide a means to investigate mechanisms of intrinsic resistance to this drug. In one study, methotrexate uptake, as measured by the displacement of PT-430, was impaired in leukemic cells from 5 of 22 patients with untreated acute myelocytic leukemia (Fig. 2). Furthermore, there was no evidence of increases in methotrexate binding to dihydrofolate reductase or alterations in dihydrofolate reductase messenger RNA (mRNA). Blast cells from patients with acute myelocytic leukemia, however, are less able to form long-chain polyglutamates than blast cells from patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia.³⁴ Therefore, the basis for the intrinsic resistance to methotrexate in the majority of patients with acute myelocytic leukemia appears to be impaired retention of methotrexate in the cells as a result of impaired polyglutamylation. In a previous study of the effect of short-term and long-term exposure of acute myelocytic and acute lymphocytic leukemia cells to methotrexate, there was no difference in the inhibition of DNA biosynthesis after short-term exposure. However, if the

who had been treated with methotrexate. A low level of dihydrofolate reductase gene amplification was detected in cells from nine of the patients. In contrast, gene amplification was detected in leukemic blast cells from only 4 of 38 patients with newly diagnosed acute lymphocytic leukemia and in only 1 of 53 with newly diagnosed acute myelocytic leukemia.³² These results were confirmed by Southern and Northern blot analyses, as well as by the measurement of dihydrofolate reductase activity. Thus, amplification of the dihydrofolate reductase gene appears to be the second most common mechanism of acquired resistance to methotrexate, occurring in ap-

Figure 3. Proposed Mechanism of Increased Dihydrofolate Reductase Activity in Cells Lacking the Retinoblastoma (Rb) Protein.

In resting cells, the heterodimeric complex of E2F-1 and DP-1 is bound to the hypophosphorylated retinoblastoma protein. At the transition from the G₁ phase to the S phase, the retinoblastoma protein is hyperphosphorylated by cyclin D and E kinases, and the bound E2F-1–DP-1 complex is released. (Five members of the E2F family of transcription factors have been identified, of which E2F-1, E2F-2, and E2F-3 bind to the retinoblastoma protein, and three members of the DP family have been identified that bind to E2F proteins.) Unbound or free E2F-1–DP-1 increases the transcription of several genes involved in DNA replication, including the gene for dihydrofolate reductase.

accumulated low concentrations of methotrexate, methotrexate polyglutamates, or both (P = 0.01). Hyperdiploid B-lineage blast cells from patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia who had a good prognosis were found to accumulate higher concentrations of long-chain polyglutamates.⁴⁰ However, polyglutamylation of methotrexate has not been evaluated as an independent prognostic variable.

After in vitro exposure to [³H]methotrexate, blast cells from children with acute monocytic leukemia (the M5 subtype, according to the French-American-British classification) were found to accumulate methotrexate polyglutamates at almost the same levels as blast cells from children with acute lymphocytic leukemia.⁴¹ This finding has led to the suggestion that methotrexate may be an effective drug in the treatment of the former disease.⁴¹

TUMOR-SUPPRESSOR GENES AND METHOTREXATE RESISTANCE

Loss of functional retinoblastoma protein may also contribute to antimetabolite resistance, because cells lacking this protein may have increased levels of enzymes associated with proliferation (e.g., dihydrofolate reductase and thymidylate synthase) as a consequence of increased levels of free E2F-1, a transcription factor that, in a heterodimeric complex with another protein, DP-1, is normally inactive, because it is bound to hypophosphorylated retinoblastoma protein (Fig. 3). When cells progress from the G₁ to the S phase, retinoblastoma protein becomes hyperphosphorylated and releases the bound E2F-1–DP-1 heterodimer, which then activates the transcription of genes involved in DNA synthesis.⁴² A human osteosarcoma cell line that lacks retinoblastoma protein, SaOs2, was found to be intrinsically resistant to methotrexate, unlike cells with retinoblastoma protein. When a cDNA encoding retinoblastoma protein was introduced into SaOs2 cells, their sensitivity to methotrexate was restored, in association with decreased levels of dihydrofolate reductase mRNA and protein.¹⁰ Low levels of retinoblastoma protein were found in 18 percent of patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia and in 19 percent of those with acute myelocytic leukemia.⁴³,⁴⁴ However, the effect of the lack of retinoblastoma protein on the sensitivity of cells to methotrexate and other drugs has not been determined.

Since levels of free E2F-1 increase when retinoblastoma protein is hyperphosphorylated, changes in regulators of retinoblastoma-protein phosphorylation, such as members of the cyclin-dependent kinase system (cyclin D1 and cyclin-dependent kinase 4), may also cause an increase in dihydrofolate reductase transcription and, hence, methotrexate resistance. Certain tumors express high levels of cyclin D1, and methotrexate sensitivity may be decreased in these tumors.⁴⁵,⁴⁶ It is becoming increasingly clear

that the deregulation of cell-cycle genes may have a profound effect on antimetabolite resistance.

Mutations of the p53 tumor-suppressor gene predispose cells to a resistance to antimetabolites through amplification of the target gene of the antimetabolite.⁴⁷,⁴⁸ Mutations of the p53 gene were found in seven of nine patients with amplified dihydrofolate reductase in blast cells.³² Three of 38 patients studied at the time of diagnosis had p53 mutations, and all 3 had relapses and died within a year after diagnosis; the development of clinical resistance to methotrexate was associated with amplification of the dihydrofolate reductase gene in these 3 patients. A second group of eight patients with p53 mutations at the time of relapse also subsequently died (median survival, 17 months after the diagnosis, vs. 60 months among patients with relapses but without p53 mutations). These results suggest that in patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia, p53 mutations detected either at presentation or during a relapse are associated with a poor prognosis.

STRATEGIES TO OVERCOME OR EXPLOIT METHOTREXATE RESISTANCE

An understanding of the determinants of methotrexate cytotoxicity and mechanisms of resistance is guiding the design of new folate antagonists, as well as new strategies to target resistant cells selectively (Table 2).⁷,⁴⁹ Edatrexate, a dihydrofolate reductase inhibitor,⁵⁰ and tomudex, a thymidylate synthase inhibitor,⁵¹ were designed to be transported more efficiently by the reduced folate carrier and to be polyglutamylated more effectively and retained in cells (Fig. 4). Both compounds are active against solid tumors.⁴⁹ On the basis of its use in colon cancer,⁵² tomudex is now being compared with the combination of fluorouracil and leucovorin in a phase 3 trial.

Unlike the findings with methotrexate, in vitro studies of acute myelocytic leukemia blast cells show efficient uptake and retention of edatrexate and tomudex as long-chain polyglutamates,⁵³ suggesting that they may be effective in the treatment of acute myelocytic leukemia.

Although cells that are resistant to methotrexate because of defects in the reduced folate carrier would be expected to be cross-resistant to the compounds mentioned above, a second class of folate antagonists, which are taken up by cells through a process not mediated by a carrier, are being investigated in clinical trials. Drugs of this type lack the terminal glutamate of the folate molecule that is required for transport by the reduced folate carrier or folate receptor. Trimetrexate, one of these compounds, accumulates in cells and would be effective in cells with impaired methotrexate uptake.⁵⁴,⁵⁵ Clinically, trimetrexate has moderate activity against breast, lung, head and neck, and bladder cancer,⁵⁶ and limited and transient responses have been reported in patients with acute leukemia. In these trials, the chief dose-limiting toxic effect was severe mucositis.⁵⁷,⁵⁸

The combination of trimetrexate and leucovorin is active against *P. carinii* infections.⁴ Trimetrexate is taken up by this parasite, but leucovorin is not, because the organism lacks the reduced folate carrier. We have used this combination of drugs to target leukemia cells that are resistant to methotrexate because of impaired uptake. In vitro studies showed that leucovorin did not protect CCRF-CEM cells with impaired methotrexate uptake against the cytotoxic effects of trimetrexate. In mice with severe combined immunodeficiency and methotrexate-resistant CCRF-CEM acute lymphocytic leukemia cells, trimetrexate combined with leucovorin resulted in marked tumor regression.⁵⁹ On the basis of these findings, we

now being used to guide the development of new drugs and generate new methods of treatment.

## CONCLUSIONS

The availability of sensitive molecular and biochemical assays has made it possible to understand why tumor cells are intrinsically either resistant or sensitive to methotrexate, as well as the mechanisms of acquired resistance to the drug. With this knowledge, in turn, it is possible to predict the response to and outcome of treatment with methotrexate. Information about drug resistance and sensitivity is
