**REGULATION OF B-CELL SIGNAL TRANSDUCTION BY ADAPTOR PROTEINS**

Tomohiro Kurosaki

An important role has emerged for adaptor molecules in linking cell-surface receptors, such as the B-cell antigen receptor, with effector enzymes. Adaptor proteins direct the appropriate subcellular localization of effectors and regulate their activity by inducing conformational changes, both of which, in turn, contribute to the spatio-temporal precision of B-cell signal-transduction events. In addition, adaptor molecules participate in establishing negative- or positive-feedback regulatory loops in signalling networks, thereby fine-tuning the B-cell response.

The tremendous diversity and plasticity of immune responses are well exemplified by the B-cell branch of the immune system. Indeed, B cells undergo negative selection in the bone marrow, generate humoral responses in the periphery, and establish tolerance and memory. To accomplish this, B-cell signalling through the B-cell receptor (BCR) leads to a wide range of biological outputs, which depend on the developmental stage of the B cell and properties of the antigen. A simple 'on-off' mode of signal transduction would not allow for such a diversity of responses. Rather, BCR signals must be precisely regulated in terms of their magnitude and duration. Accordingly, in addition to the BCR, other cell-surface receptors contribute to B-cell responses: first, by functioning as co-receptors; second, by supporting proliferation (for example, tumour-necrosis factor (TNF) receptor family members and other cytokine receptors); or third, by interacting with other types of immune cells, including T cells and stromal cells (for example, adhesion receptors and chemokine receptors). Co-receptors, such as CD19–CD21 (positive) or FcγRIIB (negative), are particularly important in that they contribute to the recognition of whether an antigen is bound to antibody or complement (BOX 1).

In addition to cell-surface receptors, it is now clear that adaptor molecules are involved in modulating signal transduction by mediating protein–protein or protein–lipid interactions. Adaptor molecules are commonly defined as proteins that possess protein–protein or protein–lipid interaction domains—for example, SRC-homology 2 (SH2), SH3 or pleckstrin homology (PH) domains—but do not have enzymatic activity. However, many enzymes can be considered to function as adaptor proteins, because they additionally contain protein- or lipid-binding modules. For example, the SRC-family protein-tyrosine kinase (PTK) LYN has one SH2 domain and one SH3 domain, as well as an enzymatic domain (FIG. 1). In addition, certain co-receptors, such as paired immunoglobulin-like receptor B (PIRB) and CD19, contain cytoplasmic protein–protein interaction modules and can, therefore, be considered to be adaptors also. The interaction modules in adaptors and enzymes act to localize proteins to specific subcellular sites, control enzyme activities and direct the formation of multiprotein complexes—all of which, in turn, contribute to the qualitative and quantitative control of B-cell signalling.

Many excellent reviews have been published recently that describe the role of each adaptor molecule in B-cell signalling¹⁻³ and its influence on biological outcomes⁴⁻⁶. Hence, this review emphasizes the common ways in which a few of the crucial adaptor proteins exert their functions, thereby tuning B-cell responses—with a particular focus on PTK activation events and lipid signalling.

### CD19–CD21

CD19 is a B-cell-specific transmembrane glycoprotein that is expressed from the pro-B-cell to the plasma-cell stage. On mature B cells, CD19 associates with three different molecules to form a tetrameric complex comprising CD21 (complement receptor type 2), **CD81** (transporter for antigen processing 1) and **LEU13** (interferon-induced transmembrane protein 1). On B-cell receptor (BCR) activation, the cytoplasmic tail of CD19 is phosphorylated by LYN, and provides binding sites for the SRC-homology 2 (SH2) domains of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and VAV.

### FcγRIIB

FcγRIIB, an inhibitory receptor for the Fc of immunoglobulin G, contains one immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM) in its cytoplasmic domain. When FcγRIIB is co-ligated with BCR, SH2-domain-containing inositol 5-phosphatase (SHIP) is recruited, leading to the abrogation of BCR signalling by the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate (PtdIns₃).

### CD22

**CD22** is an ITIM-containing surface molecule that interacts with sialic-acid-bearing ligands. It is a member of the sialoadhesin class of immunoglobulin-superfamily receptors. The ubiquitous distribution of sialic-acid-bearing ligands might account for the generalized inhibitory property of CD22 on B cells in regulating activation through the BCR. The ITIMs in CD22 interact with SH2-domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase 1 (SHP1), thereby opposing the activation that is mediated by the BCR.

### PIRA/PIRB

Paired immunoglobulin-like receptor A (PIRA) and PIRB have similar extracellular domains, which indicates that they have the same ligand specificity, although their ligand is still unknown. PIRB has two ITIMs in its cytoplasmic domain, phosphorylation of which recruits SHP1. This attenuates BCR-triggered activation responses through the dephosphorylation of several intracellular substrates, including SYK and Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK). In contrast to PIRB, PIRA functions as a stimulatory receptor through its association with the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)-bearing FcR γ-chain.

Figure 1 | Signalling molecules that are found in B cells illustrated to highlight their modular structures and protein–protein interaction domains. Adaptor proteins are defined commonly as proteins that possess protein–protein or protein–lipid interaction domains but do not have enzymatic activity. In this regard, BLNK, BCAP, GAB, PAG and LAT are prototypical adaptor proteins. However, the enzymes that are shown here contain protein- or lipid-binding domains, such as SH2 and SH3 domains, in addition to enzymatic activity. So, in this review, these enzymes are considered to have adaptor functions in addition to enzymatic activities. The SH2 domain recognizes phosphotyrosine. The SH3 domain contributes to protein–protein interactions by binding to proline-rich peptide sequences.

IMMUNORECEPTOR TYROSINE-BASED ACTIVATION MOTIF (ITAM). A structural motif containing tyrosine residues that is found in the cytoplasmic tails of several activating receptors, such as the BCR. The motif has the form Tyr-Xaa-Xaa-Leu/Ile, and the tyrosine is a target for phosphorylation by SRC tyrosine kinases and subsequent binding of proteins containing SH2 domains.

Although the molecular bases for these developmentally regulated and antigen-induced differences in BCR partitioning remain elusive, some clues have emerged. Co-receptors could affect the equilibrium of distribution of BCR between rafts and non-rafts. CD19, complexed with the complement receptor CD21, is excluded from rafts in resting B cells, whereas co-ligation of the BCR and CD19–CD21 by complement-tagged antigens results in the translocation of both receptors to and their prolonged residency in rafts, which leads to the augmentation of BCR signalling¹⁹. By contrast, once latent membrane protein 2A (LMP2A) — a multimembrane-spanning protein that is encoded by Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) — is ectopically expressed, this molecule resides constitutively in rafts and blocks BCR entry into rafts²⁰. So, these results indicate that the expression of other membrane proteins, particularly proteins with affinity for rafts, as well as the association of the BCR with these proteins, affects the extent and duration of BCR inclusion within rafts, thereby influencing its signalling.

It is now well established that, in the case of BCR signalling, PTKs, adaptors and effector enzymes are recruited to the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane as a result of ligand-mediated activation. As discussed above, in view of the importance of rafts to BCR signalling, the signalling complex is probably formed in rafts, where this complex will be protected from non-raft enzymes, including receptor phosphatases (such as CD45), that otherwise could affect the signalling process (FIG.2). So, key issues to be resolved include: how each component is assembled in the rafts to form a complex; how this complex is maintained; what consequences this complex has; and how the complexes are disassembled.

**Regulation of PTKs by adaptor molecules**

The sequential activation of three different PTKs — LYN, SYK and Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) — is required to regulate downstream effectors in BCR signalling. Indeed, deficiencies of these PTKs result in defective or aberrant B-cell function and development²¹. Data that are emerging from several laboratories indicate that adaptor molecules fine-tune the activities of these PTKs in various ways.

**Control of LYN activation by PAG.** The activities of SRC-family PTKs are regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation; autophosphorylation of Tyr416 in the SRC catalytic domain is stimulatory, whereas carboxy-terminal phosphorylation of Tyr527 is inhibitory (see FIG.1 for a description of the molecules discussed in this review). Phosphorylation of Tyr527 mediates an intramolecular association with the SH2 domain of the same kinase, which leads to repressed kinase activity²². Phosphorylation of the carboxy-terminal tyrosine of LYN is regulated by c-SRC tyrosine kinase (CSK) and CD45, thereby regulating the efficiency of BCR signalling. Indeed, the carboxy-terminal tyrosine of LYN is hyperphosphorylated in CD45-deficient B cells and hypophosphorylated in CSK-deficient B cells, which illustrates the negative role of CSK and the positive role of CD45 in regulating the activation of LYN²³,²⁴.

Another way in which SRC-family PTKs can be regulated was implied by the finding that when a mutation that is analogous to the Src Tyr527Phe (constitutively activating) mutation is introduced into the Lyn locus in mice, the expression level of the resulting constitutively active Lyn in B cells is clearly decreased²⁸. Moreover, the active form of Lyn, like activated Src, is subject to ubiquitin-dependent degradation²⁹,³⁰. So, Lyn, after being activated by BCR crosslinking, could initiate a negative-feedback regulatory loop in two ways: by recruiting Csk to the rafts through the phosphorylation of Pag; and by accelerating the ubiquitin-mediated degradation of Lyn. In addition, as will be discussed below, inhibitory co-receptors, such as PIRB, after being phosphorylated by LYN, could recruit SH2-domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase 1 (SHP1), possibly into the rafts; this would lead to the dephosphorylation of Tyr416 of LYN and the subsequent downregulation of LYN kinase activity. The existence of these multiple attenuation modes, however, raises the question of the extent to which each mode operates in vivo, thereby contributing to B-cell responses.

Control of BTK activation. BTK has a pivotal role in the regulation of pre-BCR and mature BCR signalling, and it is a component of the BCR SIGNALOSOME³¹. Mutation of BTK in humans and Btk in mice results in X-linked agammaglobulinaemia (XLA) and X-linked immunodeficiency (XID), respectively. These diseases are associated with the impaired maturation of B cells, diminished immunoglobulin production, compromised T-cell-independent immune responses and marked attenuation of the sustained calcium signal on BCR stimulation³²,³³. Although the activation mechanisms of BTK have been relatively well characterized, knowledge of the negative regulatory mechanisms of BTK has remained limited until recently. However, recent results from several laboratories indicate the existence of a negative-feedback regulatory loop for BTK activation during signalling processes. A first clue to this negative loop came from the observation that BCR-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of Btk is increased and prolonged in protein kinase Cβ (Pkcβ)⁻/⁻ mice, which indicates that Pkcβ functions as a potent inhibitor of Btk. Given that Btk has a positive role in the phospholipase Cγ2 (PLCγ2)-CALCIUM-PKCβ PATHWAY, a promising model has emerged that proposes that Pkcβ, after being activated by a Btk-dependent mechanism, phosphorylates Btk, which, in turn, inactivates Btk kinase activity³⁴ (FIG. 3). Indeed, a Ser180 residue in the Tec-homology (TH) domain of Btk has been identified as a Pkcβ phosphorylation site, and the Ser180Ala Btk mutant is hyperactive, presumably owing to enhanced membrane localization³⁴. So, this negative-feedback mechanism could contribute to controlling the duration of Btk residency within the BCR signalling complexes that are formed in rafts (FIG. 3).

The recently identified adaptors inhibitor of BTK (IBTK) and SAB (SH3-domain-binding protein 5, BTK associated) could also contribute to the negative regulation of BTK. IbtK³⁵ and Sab³⁶ bind constitutively to the pleckstrin-homology (PH)-TH and SH3 domains of

Figure 2 | Raft translocation of the BCR by ligand binding. In resting B cells, the B-cell receptor (BCR) is excluded from lipid rafts, as are most plasma-membrane proteins, including CD45. The rafts concentrate glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-linked proteins and myristylated proteins, such as LYN and phosphoprotein associated with glycosphingolipid-enriched microdomains (PAG). After antigen engagement, the BCR relocates within rafts. IgH, immunoglobulin heavy chain; IgL, immunoglobulin light chain.

Until recently, however, little was known about how CSK and CD45 themselves are regulated. It is now known that the subcellular localization of CSK and CD45 is important for their function. Although the intermolecular interactions that are responsible for regulating CD45 localization are not clear, recent data indicate that the subcellular localization of CSK might be dependent on a newly identified adaptor that has affinity for rafts, known as phosphoprotein associated with GEMs (PAG; also known as CBP) (FIG. 3), which is expressed in T cells and B cells.

PAG contains several phosphorylatable tyrosines and two potential binding sites for SH3-domain-containing proteins in its cytoplasmic domain, in addition to two cysteines that form a putative palmitoylation site, which is presumed to be responsible for the constitutive targeting of PAG to rafts²⁵,²⁶. In unstimulated cells, PAG is tyrosine phosphorylated and associates with the SH2 domain of CSK. In the case of TCR engagement, PAG becomes dephosphorylated by an as yet unidentified phosphatase, and releases CSK²⁶. So, a model has emerged that proposes that in resting lymphocytes, the PAG-CSK interaction functions to keep raft-associated SRC-family PTKs in an inactive state; this is released, on receptor crosslinking, by sequestering CSK away from the rafts. As an important extension of this model, assuming that PAG is phosphorylated again in due course of signalling, this interaction might contribute to the termination of SRC-family PTK activity. The PTK that is responsible for PAG phosphorylation might be LYN, although this has not been tested directly. If so, then the LYN that is activated on BCR ligation could inhibit its own kinase activity by recruiting CSK to the rafts (FIG. 3). Hence, the phosphorylation status of PAG could have an important role in regulating the subcellular localization of CSK and also, its enzymatic activity, because the enzymatic activity of CSK is reported to be increased by its association with PAG²⁷. Both mechanisms could contribute to the fine-tuning of the activity of SRC-family PTKs.

SIGNALOSOME  
A putative, stable signalling complex, which consists of BTK, BLNK, BCAP, VAV1/2, PLCγ2 and PI3K, that is proposed to regulate intracellular calcium and subsequent downstream events.

PLCγ2-CALCIUM-PKCβ PATHWAY  
Activated phospholipase Cγ2 (PLCγ2), presumably tyrosine phosphorylated by Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK), converts phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns₃₂) into two second messengers, diacylglycerol (DAG) and InsP₃. DAG activates protein kinase Cβ (PKCβ), and InsP₃ causes the release of calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum through its binding to InsP₃ receptors.

Btk, respectively, and this binding inhibits Btk enzymatic activity. In contrast to the rapid negative regulation of Btk by Pkcβ-mediated phosphorylation, the expression level of Ibk and Sab seems to be crucial for their negative effect on Btk. However, Tyr223 and Ser180 in Btk, which are located near to the PH–TH and SH3 domains (FIG. 1), are phosphorylated on BCR ligation, which raises the possibility that these phosphorylation events somehow change the association state between Ibk/Sab and Btk, thereby modulating Btk kinase activity.

**Regulation of lipid-metabolizing enzymes**

BCR ligation leads to the rapid stimulation of phosphoinositide metabolism and the generation of multiple second messengers, which influence B-cell development and function. In fact, deletion of an enzyme that is responsible for this metabolism, such as phosphoinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) or Plcγ2, results in aberrant B-cell development and immune responses^{37–44}. The balance of phosphoinositide metabolism is mediated by at least five enzymes: PI5K, PI3K, PLCγ2, SH2-domain-containing inositol 5-phosphatase (SHIP) and phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) (FIG. 4). Hence, the generation of lipid second messengers is dependent on the balance between these enzymes, the activities of which are regulated by several mechanisms, including tyrosine phosphorylation and subcellular localization. In particular, given the evidence that phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P₂)^{43} and, possibly, PtdIns(3,4,5)P₃ are concentrated in lipid rafts, the constitutive or inducible localization of PLCγ2, PI3K, SHIP and PTEN in rafts could be an important regulatory point for exerting their functions.

**PtdInsP₂ hydrolysis: PLCγ2 recruitment and BLNK**

The importance of translocation of PLCγ2 to lipid rafts on BCR engagement was indicated by the finding that chemical disruption of rafts in B cells results in a failure of BCR-mediated phosphorylation of PLCγ2 and its subsequent activation^{44} (although one study seems to contradict this^{92}). So, the question arises as to the molecular mechanism by which PLCγ2 is targeted to rafts. Given the evidence that the PLCγ2 SH2 domains are essential for its activation on BCR engagement, it was thought initially that the recruitment of PLCγ2 SH2 domains to tyrosine-phosphorylated Igα/Igβ (CD79A/CD79B) or SYK could be a potential mechanism for the translocation of PLCγ2. However, this hypothesis seems improbable; reconstitution studies of BCR signalling components in a non-lymphoid cell line show that Igα/Igβ, SYK and PLCγ2 are not sufficient to activate a BCR-dependent calcium signal^{45}. Instead, an adaptor molecule, B-cell linker (BLNK; also known as SLP65, BASH and BCA)^{46–49} — which was isolated as one of the proteins that are tyrosine phosphorylated after BCR ligation — has been shown to be a key docking partner for PLCγ2 SH2 domains (FIG. 5). Of the two PLCγ2 SH2 domains, the amino-terminal domain is more crucial for binding to phosphorylated BLNK^{50}. The functional importance of the interaction between BLNK and PLCγ2 has been shown by experiments that used *Blnk*⁻/⁻ and *Plcg2*⁻/⁻ DT40 B cells. *Blnk*⁻/⁻ B cells failed to induce the translocation of Plcγ2 to rafts and its subsequent activation^{51}. Moreover, a Plcγ2 amino-terminal SH2 mutant was shown to be incapable of binding to phosphorylated Blnk or of being targeted to lipid rafts^{50}. Hence, BLNK acts to bring PLCγ2 to rafts, wherein PLCγ2 becomes tyrosine phosphorylated and activated. Indeed, BLNK is targeted to rafts on BCR engagement. So, the next issue that must be addressed is the mechanism of targeting BLNK to rafts. In the case of T cells, stimulation of the T-cell receptor (TCR) drives SLP76 (SH2-domain-containing leukocyte protein of 76 kDa) — a homologue of BLNK — to the rafts via an adaptor molecule that is known as linker for activation of T cells (LAT)^{52,53}, which is located in rafts before TCR stimulation. By analogy with the T-cell system, the existence of a LAT-like adaptor molecule in B cells could be a potential mechanism^{54,55}. Another possibility is that BLNK does not require an adaptor molecule to be targeted to the rafts. For example, the direct association of BLNK with SYK or Igα/Igβ could be sufficient for its targeting. In this regard, it has been proposed that binding of the BLNK SH2 domain to phosphorylated Igα could recruit BLNK to the BCR signalling complex^{56,99}. Indeed, Igα undergoes phosphorylation of three tyrosine residues on BCR ligation, two of which are crucial for binding to SYK SH2 domains and the remaining one for binding to the BLNK SH2 domain^{56,99}. So, this model is appealing in that it might explain why BLNK becomes a good substrate for SYK in the context of BCR signalling.

**Figure 3 | Models of negative-feedback regulatory loops for LYN and BTK.** A | This model assumes that phosphoprotein associated with glycosphingolipid-enriched microdomains (PAG) is tyrosine phosphorylated by LYN (**a**). Then, the phosphorylated PAG recruits c-SRC tyrosine kinase (CSK) to the rafts (**b**), thereby allowing it to phosphorylate Tyr527 on LYN (**c**), which, in turn, decreases the enzymatic activity of LYN. B | On B-cell receptor (BCR) ligation, Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) phosphorylates several tyrosine residues on phospholipase Cγ2 (PLCγ2) (**a**), which is important for PLCγ2 activation (**b**) and subsequent recruitment of protein kinase Cβ (PKCβ) (**c**). Then, the activated PKCβ phosphorylates Ser180 (**d**) in the TEC-homology domain of BTK (see FIG. 1), which, in turn, inactivates the BTK activity.

pathway, as BCR-mediated calcium mobilization is decreased, but still occurs, in $Blnk^{-/-}$ B cells ${ }^{61,62}$. A straightforward explanation is that other adaptor molecule(s) assist the activation of PLC$\gamma$2. Among various candidate molecules, the co-receptor CD19 seems probable, because BCR-mediated calcium mobilization, as well as Btk activation, is decreased in $Cd19^{-/-}$ mouse splenic B cells ${ }^{63-65}$. Moreover, ligating CD19 alone could induce calcium mobilization, although to a lesser extent than BCR engagement.

PtdIns${}_2$ hydrolysis: PIRB and SHP1. Because tyrosine phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic tails of co-receptors is well known to regulate the strength of BCR signalling by recruiting effector enzymes, co-receptors can be viewed as adaptor molecules also. A typical example is attenuation of the BCR-initiated PLC$\gamma$2 pathway by the inhibitory receptor PIRB ${ }^{66,67}$. Although the ligand for PIRB is still unknown, two modes of PIRB operation can be envisaged. First, when a target cell expresses both a BCR-binding antigen and a putative PIRB ligand, PIRB might be brought into close proximity to antigen-bound BCR. Mimicking this situation, the coligation of PIRB and BCR results in the recruitment of SHP1, a tyrosine phosphatase, to the phosphorylated IMMUNORECEPTOR TYROSINE-BASED INHIBITORY MOTIFS (ITIMs) in the cytoplasmic domain of PIRB ${ }^{68,69}$. The associated SHP1 then induces the dephosphorylation of SYK, BTK, LYN and BLNK, which, in turn, downregulates PLC$\gamma$2 activation ${ }^{70}$ (FIG. 6). Second, assuming that a target cell expresses only the putative PIRB ligand, its interaction with PIRB might sequester PIRB away from the vicinity of the BCR. According to this model — together with evidence that PIRB is, to some extent, phosphorylated and associated with SHP1 in resting B cells ${ }^{71}$ — PIRB could function as a positive regulator of BCR signalling by excluding SHP1 that could, otherwise, inhibit BCR signalling. Indeed, the importance of SHP1 in inhibiting the PLC$\gamma$2 pathway was shown by the finding that BCR-mediated calcium mobilization seems to be augmented in $Shp1^{-/-}$ mice ${ }^{72,73}$. Hence, regardless of the mode of operation of PIRB, the tyrosine phosphorylation status of PIRB and its localization relative to the BCR seem to be crucial for the spatiotemporal regulation of SHP1, thereby fine-tuning the BCR signal.

In addition to its role in PLC$\gamma$2 translocation, BLNK could also explain the requirement for both SYK and BTK in the BCR-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC$\gamma$2. After BLNK is tyrosine phosphorylated by SYK, the phosphorylated BLNK provides binding sites for the BTK SH2 domain, as well as the PLC$\gamma$2 SH2 domains. This brings BTK into close proximity of PLC$\gamma$2 (REFS 57,58) (FIG. 5). The association of BTK with BLNK could also enhance the enzymatic activity of BTK by two mechanisms ${ }^{59}$: by inducing a conformational change in BTK that leads to its increased activity; or by making BTK more susceptible to SYK-mediated transphosphorylation of its Tyr551, which is known to result in a fivefold increase in BTK enzymatic activity. Subsequently, the activated BTK phosphorylates tyrosine residues on PLC$\gamma$2 that are crucial to its activation (FIG. 5).

The possibility that another mechanism, in addition to the tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC$\gamma$2, is required for full PLC$\gamma$2 activation was suggested by mutational analysis of **PLC$\gamma$1** in T-cell signalling. This indicated that a constitutive interaction between the PLC$\gamma$1 SH3 domain and the proline-rich region of SLP76 is vital for sufficient PLC$\gamma$1 activation in T cells ${ }^{60}$. It is, therefore, probable that two types of association — phosphotyrosine-SH2-dependent and proline-rich-SH3-dependent — between BLNK and PLC$\gamma$2 are required for full PLC$\gamma$2 activation in B cells. The former interaction is responsible for targeting PLC$\gamma$2 to rafts and the latter interaction seems to be responsible for altering the conformation of PLC$\gamma$2, which leads to a pre-activated state and/or one that is more susceptible to phosphorylation.

Although the importance of BLNK in BCR-mediated activation of PLC$\gamma$2 is clear, analysis of **$Blnk^{-/-}$** mice indicates the existence of an alternative PLC$\gamma$2 activation

PtdIns${}_3$ generation: PI3K recruitment and CD19. On BCR ligation, the cytoplasmic tail of CD19 is phosphorylated by LYN, and provides binding sites for the SH2 domains of the p85 subunit of PI3K, VAV (a guanine nucleotide exchange factor; GEF) and LYN ${ }^{74}$. As the intramolecular interaction between the LYN SH2 domain and its carboxy-terminal phosphotyrosine keeps LYN kinase in the inactive state, the SH2-dependent association of LYN with CD19 could release the autoinhibition of LYN, thereby stimulating its enzymatic activity and promoting processive phosphorylation ${ }^{75}$. Hence, the CD19 cytoplasmic domain functions to amplify LYN activity in the BCR signalling context, as well as to recruit effector molecules to the plasma membrane.

Although the involvement of CD19 in the BCR-induced activation of PI3K is clear, this mechanism does not seem to fully account for the activation of PI3K. BCR-mediated activation of Akt, a readout of Pi3k activation, is inhibited, but still occurs in B cells from $CD19^{-/-}$ mice ${ }^{76}$. Furthermore, B-cell developmental and functional defects in $p85\alpha Pi3k^{-/-}$ mice are more severe than those in $CD19^{-/-}$ mice ${ }^{39,40,77,78}$, which suggests the existence of additional adaptor molecule(s) that act between the BCR-associated PTKs and the PI3K p85 subunit. The recently isolated cytoplasmic adaptor molecule B-cell adaptor for PI3K (BCAP) seems to be required for targeting PI3K to rafts and its subsequent activation in DT40 B cells ${ }^{79}$. In contrast to these data from cell lines, however, $Bcap^{-/-}$ mice have seemingly normal activation of Akt, although the importance of Bcap in B1 B-CELL development and thymus-independent type II (TI-II) antibody responses is clear ${ }^{100}$. One explanation for these differences is that mouse primary B cells might use more adaptor molecules than the B-cell lines for targeting PI3K to rafts, and there might be functional redundancy among the adaptor molecules. Indeed, given the association of GRB2-associated binding protein 1 (GAB1) with PI3K on BCR ligation, as well as the importance of GAB2 in Fc$\epsilon$RI-mediated PI3K activation, GAB-family proteins could be promising candidates for additional adaptors ${ }^{80,81}$.

PtdIns${}_{3}$ generation: PI3K activation and VAV. As in the case of PLC$\gamma$2 activation, through binding of the SH2 domains of PI3K p85 subunit to the phosphoryl-rosines of CD19, PI3K could be translocated to lipid rafts. Thereby, the PI3K is allowed access to its substrate, PtdIns(3,4,5)P${}_{3}$, which is known to be enriched in rafts ${ }^{82}$. Recent results indicate that this targeting mechanism is necessary, but not sufficient, for PI3K activation on BCR engagement (FIG. 5). An initial clue to a second mechanism of activation came from the observation that Fc$\epsilon$RI-mediated Akt activation is clearly inhibited in mast cells from $Vav1^{-/-}$ mice ${ }^{83}$. A role for Vav is further supported by the fact that Akt activation on TCR or BCR engagement is also attenuated in $Vav1^{-/-}$ thymocytes or $Vav3^{-/-}$ DT40 B cells, respectively ${ }^{84,101}$. Considering that the three Vav isoforms (Vav1, Vav2 and Vav3), despite each possessing a unique function, also have overlapping functions, these data indicate that Vav might have an overlapping role in PI3K activation. More importantly, the targeting of PI3K to rafts is not affected in $Vav3^{-/-}$ B cells. Instead, the enzymatic activity of PI3K seems to be enhanced by VAV, in that an active form of RAC1 (a RHO-family, small GTP-binding protein), a downstream target of the VAV family, is able to increase the enzymatic activity of PI3K in vitro ${ }^{84}$. So, a model is proposed in which PI3K, after being recruited to rafts (for example, by CD19) undergoes a conformational change that is mediated by active RAC1 ${ }^{85,86}$, both of which are required for PI3K activation (FIG. 5). This model, however, opposes the previous view that PI3K functions as an upstream regulator for VAV-family members, on the basis of in vitro evidence that PtdIns(3,4,5)P${}_{3}$, a product of PI3K, binds to the VAV PH domain, thereby enhancing its GEF activity ${ }^{87}$ (FIG. 1). One interpretation that reconciles these two models is that in addition to the regulation of PI3K by VAV, the PtdIns(3,4,5)P${}_{3}$ that is produced by PI3K could reciprocally influence VAV function, thereby creating a positive-feedback regulatory loop that amplifies the generation of PtdIns(3,4,5)P${}_{3}$.

Various PH-domain-containing molecules, including VAV, BTK and PLC$\gamma$2, selectively bind PtdIns(3,4,5)P${}_{3}$, a product of PI3K activity. This indicates two mechanisms by which the PI3K and PLC$\gamma$2 pathways are connected. First, PtdIns(3,4,5)P${}_{3}$ is involved indirectly in PLC$\gamma$2 activation through its binding to the BTK PH domain and subsequent BTK activation.

The first step of activation of A | phospholipase C$\gamma$2 (PLC$\gamma$2) and B | phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) requires their recruitment to the rafts (a), presumably because their substrate, phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PtdInsP${}_{2}$) is enriched in the rafts. Tyrosine phosphorylation of (A) B-cell linker (BLNK) and (B) CD19 participates in this process. Then, in the case of PLC$\gamma$2 activation, this enzyme undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation by Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) (A, b), which is important for PLC$\gamma$2 activation (A, c). In the case of PI3K, the recruited PI3K is then activated by activated RAC (B, b).

phosphorylation, it provides binding sites for the phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domains of docking-family proteins (DOK1 and DOK2) and SH2-domain-containing transforming protein (SHC)<sup>93</sup>. DOK1 and DOK2 are implicated in the downregulation of RAS activation through recruiting a RAS-GTPase-activating protein (RAS-GAP) to rafts. Indeed, BCR-mediated activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk; also known as Mapk1) is enhanced in B cells from *Dok1*<sup>−/−</sup> mice<sup>94</sup>. Collectively, these data indicate that altering the subcellular localization of SHIP and of its binding partner DOK contributes to the termination of PI3K and ERK pathways.

**PtdInsP<sub>3</sub> dephosphorylation: PTEN.** PTEN acts as a tumour suppressor, and its encoding gene is mutated/deleted in various tumours. The observation that T cells that lack PTEN have constitutive activation of PI3K signalling pathways, which results in the hyperactivation of TEC-family PTKs, AKT and RAC/RHO GTPases<sup>95</sup>, indicates that PTEN is also likely to function as an ‘off’ switch for PI3K signalling in B cells. In support of this, Akt hyperactivation was observed in B cells from mice with a B-cell-specific null mutation of *Pten* (A. Suzuki and T. Nakano, unpublished observations). Although the functional importance of PTEN is clear, there is little information regarding the regulation of PTEN expression, localization or activity. PTEN is phosphorylated near its carboxy terminus on serine and threonine residues, perhaps by casein kinase 2 (CK2), which might decrease its stability<sup>96</sup>. The carboxy terminus of PTEN contains a PDZ-binding domain, which could regulate its localization to rafts, where its substrate, PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>, resides. Indeed, the sophistication of signalling networks that are maintained by PDZ interactions is well exemplified by inaD, a polypeptide with five PDZ domains that regulates phototransduction in *Drosophila melanogaster*. inaD associates through distinct PDZ domains with a calcium channel (*trp*); PLCβ, the target of rhodopsin-activated heterotrimeric G proteins (Gαq); and PKC<sup>97</sup>. So, inaD organizes these proteins into a signalling complex that allows efficient activation of the trp channel by PLCβ in response to stimulation of rhodopsin, and deactivation through phosphorylation of trp by PKC<sup>98</sup>. Similarly, a target molecule with multiple PDZ domains for PTEN, although not yet identified, could act as a scaffolding protein to organize the multiple components that are involved in efficient phosphoinositide metabolism.

### Conclusions

In contrast to the preformed signalling complexes that function downstream of receptors such as G-protein-coupled receptors, the BCR uses receptor-inducible assembly mechanisms, which require the inclusion or exclusion of signalling molecules in particular sites within cells. To accomplish this, one of the important functions of adaptor molecules is, by association with multiple effector enzymes, to facilitate the selective partitioning of these effectors into discrete subcellular locations. The activation of effectors is thought to require at

TI-II RESPONSE  
Thymus-independent type II  
(TI-II) antigens, which are derived typically from polysaccharides, consist of complex repeating units that drive B-cell responses by extensive crosslinking. Both B1 and marginal-zone B cells are thought to be responsible for TI-II antibody responses.

least two signals. The simple partitioning of effectors is necessary (one signal), but not sufficient. In addition, the association between an adaptor and multiple effectors can bring two distinct effectors into close proximity of each other, whereby conformational changes of the effectors and/or their phosphorylation/dephosphorylation take place (signal 2). Consequently, the effector enzymes can be activated. These mechanisms are thought to contribute to complex and diverse B-cell signalling networks, including multiple positive- and negative-feedback mechanisms.

Despite the progress described here, understanding the physiological functions and regulation of such signalling networks remains a challenge. For these studies, techniques such as fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) analysis, in addition to the current genetic and biochemical approaches, need to be developed to measure the kinetics of signalling complexes with high spatiotemporal resolution in the context of living cells. Furthermore, detailed analysis of gene-expression patterns by microarray technology will reveal new links between cytoplasmic and nuclear events.
