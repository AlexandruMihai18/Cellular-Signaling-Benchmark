### Summary

Bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) are unique and complex glycolipids that provide characteristic components of the outer membranes of Gram-negative bacteria. In LPS of the Enterobacteriaceae, the core oligosaccharide links a highly conserved lipid A to the antigenic O-polysaccharide. Structural diversity in the core oligosaccharide is limited by the constraints imposed by its essential role in outer membrane stability and provides a contrast to the hypervariable O-antigen. The genetics of core oligosaccharide biosynthesis in *Salmonella* and *Escherichia coli* K-12 have served as prototypes for studies on the LPS and lipo-oligosaccharides from a growing range of bacteria. However, despite the wealth of knowledge, there remains a number of unanswered questions, and direct experimental data are not yet available to define the precise mechanism of action of many gene products. Here we present a comparative analysis of the recently completed sequences of the major core oligosaccharide biosynthesis gene clusters from the five known core types in *E. coli* and the Ra core type of *Salmonella enterica* serovar Typhimurium and discuss advances in the understanding of the related biosynthetic pathways. Differences in these clusters reflect important structural variations in the outer core oligosaccharides and provide a basis for ascribing functions to the genes in these model clusters, whereas highly conserved regions within these clusters suggest a critical and unalterable function for the inner region of the core.

### Introduction

The general features of bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) are now well established. Lipid A, the hydrophobic moiety of LPS, forms the outer leaflet of the outer membrane and is responsible for many of the biological properties attributed to endotoxic LPS (Raetz, 1996; Wyckoff *et al.*, 1998). Attached to lipid A is a short core oligosaccharide (core OS) that is divided into two structurally distinct regions: the inner (lipid A proximal) and outer core OS. The core OS is the terminal part of the LPS molecule in rough LPS (R-LPS). However, in families such as the Enterobacteriaceae and the Pseudomonadaceae an antigenic, repeat-structure O-polysaccharide (O-PS) is attached to the distal core OS to form smooth LPS (S-LPS). Alternatively, in genera such as *Haemophilus* and *Neisseria*, the core OS may be modified by serospecific domains comprising several glycosyl residues to generate lipo-oligosaccharides (LOS). General features of lipid A and the inner region of the core OS are highly conserved (particularly within families), perhaps reflecting constraints imposed by their essential roles in outer membrane integrity. The outer parts of LPS are more likely to interact with the environment and, in some bacteria, with the host immune system. Although some variations can occur in the outer core OS structure, O-PS provide the most striking example of structural diversity, with ≈170 distinct antigens reported for *Escherichia coli* alone. From the viewpoint of the molecular evolution of surface antigen diversity, the structural limitations imposed on the core OS make it a very interesting counterpoint to the almost limitless variation in O-PS.

The core OS is assembled on preformed lipid A by sequential glycosyl transfer from nucleotide sugar precursors, and it is assumed that the process involves a co-ordinated complex of membrane-associated glycosyltransferases acting at the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane. Certainly, available sequence data predict that the majority of these enzymes are peripheral membrane proteins. Transfer of the completed lipid A-core molecule across the plasma membrane to the site of O-PS ligation (Whitfield *et al.*, 1997) may involve the ATP-binding cassette (ABC)-transporter MsbA (Polissi and Georgopoulos,

1996). Current understanding of core OS assembly owes much to early studies on Salmonella enterica serovars (unless otherwise indicated, Salmonella is used in the following text to indicate S. enterica serovar Typhimurium). This work has been described in excellent past reviews (Mäkelä and Stocker, 1984; Schnaitman and Klena, 1993; Raetz, 1996).

The chromosomal waa region (formerly rfa; Table 1) contains the major core OS assembly operons, and E. coli K-12 represents the first waa region to be sequenced in its entirety. Although some functions have been biochemically characterized in E. coli K-12, characterization of others relies heavily on LPS structure and LPS-specific phage receptor data for Salmonella mutants and on heterologous complementation of those mutations. Comparative sequence analysis of the waa regions from type strains representing the known core OS types of E. coli and Salmonella reveals some expected similarities but also some intriguing differences in the spectrum of waa genes and the structures of predicted gene products. Homologues of core OS biosynthetic genes are now being identified in a variety of nonenteric bacteria and advances in whole-genome sequencing will result in a rapid expansion of

data in this area. As many gene assignments currently rely heavily on E. coli and Salmonella prototypes, a consideration of the limitations of the functional assignments in these prototypes is critical.

### Structure and function of core OS

The core OS in E. coli and Salmonella share a common organization (Fig. 1), and the structures of many of the known core OS have been reviewed elsewhere (Holst and Brade, 1992). The core OS is not generally considered a virulence factor per se, although recent reports have implicated it in the adhesion of some bacteria to host cells (Jacques, 1996). The core OS does, however, have some indirect roles in virulence. For example, it provides the attachment site for O-PS (an accepted virulence factor in most of the Enterobacteriaceae). Also, the inner core OS plays a crucial role in establishing the essential barrier function of the outer membrane, which may explain the high degree of structural conservation in E. coli and Salmonella (Fig. 2). Limited structural variation in the core OS, in comparison to the O-antigens, has stimulated interest in the possibility of targeting the core OS for the generation

Fig. 1. Generalized structure of the carbohydrate backbone of the LPS core OS (Holst and Brade, 1992). The inner core is highly conserved; it comprises three 3-deoxy-D-manno-oct-2-ulosonic acid (Kdo) and L-glycero-D-manno-heptose (Hep) residues and is often phosphorylated (Fig. 2). The outer core comprises a tri-hexose backbone modified with varying side-branch substitutions of hexose and acetamidohexose residues. Dashed line indicates non-stoichiometric substitution.

of immunotherapeutic antibodies (Di Padova et al., 1993; Stanislavsky et al., 1997 and references therein).

Until recently, only one wild-type core OS structure had been described in Salmonella spp. (chemotype Ra in serovar Typhimurium). However, a recent report has described a second structure in serovar Arizonae IIIa O62 (Olsthorn et al., 1998) that differs from the Ra core OS in a single terminal side-branch in the outer core (Fig. 3). In *E. coli* there are five distinct core structures, termed K-12 and R1–R4, and these vary principally in the outer core OS regions (Fig. 3). Of these, the *E. coli* R1 core OS is the most prevalent in clinical isolates of *E. coli* (Gibb et al., 1992; Appelmelk et al., 1994). Structures identical to the *E. coli* R1, R3 and R4 types have been described in *Shigella* species (Holst and Brade, 1992 and references therein). Ironically, the K-12 core (formed by the actions of the best characterized *waa* gene products) is not detected at any appreciable frequency in clinical isolates (Gibb et al., 1992; Appelmelk et al., 1994; K. Amor, D. E. Heinrichs and C. Whitfield, unpublished).

In the laboratory, the minimal LPS structure required for *E. coli* and *Salmonella* viability consists of lipid A glycosylated with two Kdo residues, often referred to as Re LPS. This minimal structure may reflect a limitation for the successful translocation of LPS to form a viable outer membrane. In these bacteria, lipid A is not fully acylated in the absence of Kdo, and only conditional mutants of lipid A or

increased susceptibility to attack by lysosomal fractions of polymorphonuclear leucocytes and to phagocytosis by macrophages (Hammond *et al.*, 1984) suggest that the heptose region of the LPS molecule may provide novel therapeutic targets in many bacteria. Interestingly, phosphorylation is not the only way to achieve a robust outer membrane because there is no phosphorylation of the core OS in *Klebsiella pneumoniae* – the negative charges instead being provided by galacturonic acid and Kdo residues (Severn *et al.*, 1996; Süsskind *et al.*, 1998). This feature may impact significantly on the outer membrane stability of *Klebsiella* and the biosynthetic processes leading to the modification of its inner core region provide a number of interesting avenues for further investigation.

### Genetic organization and regulation of the major LPS core OS biosynthesis operons

In *E. coli* and *Salmonella*, the core OS biosynthesis gene cluster consists of three operons (Fig. 3), located in the waa region of the chromosome, and mapping between *cysE* and *pyrE* at 81–82 min on the *E. coli* K-12 and *Salmonella* linkage maps. The *gmhD*, *waaQ* and *waaA* operons are defined by the first gene of each transcriptional unit.

In *E. coli* K-12, the *gmhD* gene is the first of a block of four genes (*gmhD-waaFCL*) that form an operon required for inner core OS biosynthesis (Schnaitman and Klena, 1993; Raetz, 1996). The *gmhD*, *waaF* and *waaC* genes encode proteins involved in the biosynthesis and transfer of heptose (Table 1, Fig. 2), whereas the *waaL* gene encodes a ligase enzyme that is required for attachment of various cell-surface polysaccharides (including O-PS) to lipid A core (Whitfield *et al.*, 1997). One intriguing aspect of the regulation of the core OS biosynthesis region is that transcription of the *gmhD* operon in *E. coli* K-12 is regulated by a heat shock promoter, which may indicate that the heptose domain of LPS, at least in *E. coli* K-12, may be required for growth at elevated temperatures (Schnaitman and Klena, 1993; Raetz, 1996). The long central *waaQ* operon contains genes necessary for the biosynthesis of the outer core OS and for modification and/or decoration of core OS

(Table 1; Figs 2 and 3). The *waaA* transcript contains the structural gene (*waaA*) for the bifunctional Kdo transferase (Raetz, 1996) and a gene (designated 18k) encoding a polypeptide of unknown function. The *waaQ* and *waaA* operons are divergently transcribed and are separated by 400–500 bp of intervening DNA. A 5′ mRNA start site has been mapped for each operon, although consensus promoter sequences are not evident. A 39 bp sequence, which is designated JUMPStart (Just Upstream of Many Polysaccharide-associated gene Starts), is found in the untranslated region upstream of *waaQ* in the *Salmonella* and all of the *E. coli* core OS biosynthesis gene clusters. Part, or all, of this sequence also occurs in regulatory regions for several operons associated with cell-surface or exported structures, suggesting a common and potentially co-ordinate regulation. These include the *hly* (haemolysin synthesis and export), *kps* (*E. coli* group II capsule synthesis and export), *tra* (F-pilus synthesis and export) and most intriguingly the *rfb* (LPS O-antigen biosynthesis) operons. JUMPStart includes the conserved 8 bp region known as *ops* (operon polarity suppressor) that, together with RfaH (a NusG homologue), is required for operon polarity suppression. RfaH may interact with Rho and RNA polymerase at the transcribed *ops* element to form a more processive transcription complex that is capable of extending through certain termination elements. For a more detailed discussion of the features of RfaH/*ops*-regulated LPS biosynthesis operons, we refer the reader to Marolda and Valvano (1998) and references therein. In the case of LPS core OS biosynthesis, *Salmonella* and *E. coli* K-12 mutants deficient in RfaH produce truncated LPS molecules (reviewed in Schnaitman and Klena, 1993). Most, if not all, of the genes of the *waaQ* operon are regulated by RfaH, but the effects of an *rfaH* mutation are particularly evident in promoter-distal genes. Polar mutations argue against secondary promoters within the *waaQ* operon, and the presence of multiple termination sequences throughout this operon (Schnaitman and Klena, 1993) explains the requirement for RfaH/*ops* or an alternative antitermination system in core OS biosynthesis.

Although the general organizational features are

**Fig. 3. Structures of the outer core OS from the LPS of *E. coli* and *Salmonella* and their genetic determinants. Details of the structures are described elsewhere (Holst and Brade, 1992; Brade *et al.*, 1996; Olsthoorn *et al.*, 1998). All glycoses are in the α-anomeric configuration unless otherwise indicated. The genes whose products catalyse formation of each linkage are indicated and the basis for the assignments is discussed in the text. An asterisk denotes the residue of the core OS to which attachment of O-PS occurs. The genetic organization of the known core OS biosynthesis regions are shown. Sequence data for the core OS biosynthesis region of *S. enterica* serovar Arizonae Ila are not available. The sequence of the *E. coli* K-12 core OS biosynthesis region has been reported previously (GenBank accession numbers X62530, M80599, M86935, AE000440, U00096, M86305, U00039 and M95398) as has the majority of the equivalent *S. enterica* serovar Typhimurium region (S56361, X53847, M73826, U06472, and AF026386). The regions shown for *E. coli* reference strains with the R1 (AF019746), R2 (AF019375), R3 (AF019745) and R4 (AF019747) core OS types were each amplified by polymerase chain reaction. The primers were based on the sequences of *waaA* and *waaC* that were known to be conserved by Southern hybridization analyses (Heinrichs *et al.*, 1998). No sequence data are currently available for the regions upstream of *waaC* and downstream of *waaA* in the R-core strains and we have therefore omitted what are predicted to be conserved open reading frames (compared with *E. coli* K-12) from their chromosomal maps. The functions and predicted functions of gene products are summarized in Table 1. Further, the partial structure Glc I-1 → 3-HepII has not yet been published for the R4 core but is shown based on analogy to other known structures. This structure has been identified in the R1 core (D. E. Heinrichs *et al.*, submitted).**

conserved in *E. coli* K-12 and *Salmonella*, there are differences in the gene content of operons from different *E. coli* core types (Fig. 3). However, one striking difference is that the clinically predominant R1 and R4 types have their *waaL* gene as the last gene of the *waaQ* operon, rather than in their ‘usual’ position in the *gmhD* operon. It is currently unclear whether this has any significance in the biology of these bacteria. Other differences in individual open reading frames will be discussed below.

Conservation in enzymes for inner core OS assembly

As might be predicted by the common structure of the inner core OS in the Enterobacteriaceae (Fig. 2), enzymes responsible for its formation are highly conserved. In *E. coli*, the Kdo transferase (*WaaA*, formerly *KdtA*) is bifunctional, adding two Kdo residues (Belunis and Raetz, 1992). The enzyme responsible for the non-stoichiometric addition of the third Kdo residue is currently unidentified. *WaaA* enzymes are highly conserved, and the amino acid sequences of the six homologues from *E. coli* and *Salmonella* share more than 96% identity.

Functional analysis of the biosynthesis of the heptose region of the core OS has been limited by the lack of purified precursor (ADP-*L*-glycero-*D*-manno-heptose). Recent progress has been made by using the alternative substrate ADP-mannose, and this approach has identified *WaaC* as heptosyltransferase I (Kadrmas and Raetz, 1998). The *WaaC* enzymes from *E. coli* K-12 and *Salmonella* are functionally interchangeable (Klena et al., 1992; Schnaitman and Klena, 1993), as might be expected because the *WaaC* proteins from *Salmonella* and the five *E. coli* core types show greater than 84% total similarity. The amino acid sequence similarity of the predicted *WaaC* proteins only begins to break down in the extreme C-terminal segment of the protein. Significantly, the 3′ end of the *waaC* gene lies adjacent to the more variable *waaL* gene (see below).

Although the *waaF* gene is implicated in the transfer of the HepII residue onto the LPS core OS molecule (Schnaitman and Klena, 1993), direct demonstration of this enzymatic activity is lacking. The *Salmonella* and *E. coli* K-12 *waaF* genes have both been cloned and sequenced, and the deduced polypeptide products share 95% similarity (Sirisena et al., 1994).

The core OS structures of *E. coli* K-12 and *Salmonella* contain a stoichiometric HepIII residue (Holst and Brade, 1992), and its addition requires the product of *waaQ* (Yethon et al., 1998). A non-polar *waaQ::aacC1* insertion in an *E. coli* R1 core-type strain yields LPS totally devoid of HepIII. Sequence data are consistent with the assignment of *waaQ* as heptosyltransferase III. In *E. coli* K-12, *WaaF* shares ≈49% similarity with *WaaC* and 32% similarity with *WaaQ*, which reflects their similar enzymatic function and interaction with ADP-heptose. Most conserved residues

occur in the C-terminal half of the *WaaF* and *WaaQ* proteins from *E. coli* K-12. The predicted *WaaQ* proteins from *Salmonella* LT2 and *E. coli* R1, R2, R3 and R4 share 75.6–99.6% total similarity.

It is generally accepted that *WaaP* is involved in decoration of the inner core OS with phosphoryl substituents, although other functions have been ascribed to *WaaP* in the literature. Deduced *WaaP* proteins of *E. coli* and *Salmonella* are highly conserved, with values for total similarity varying from 89.8% to 99.6%, and the *WaaP* proteins from *Salmonella* and *E. coli* R1 are functionally interchangeable (J. A. Yethon et al., unpublished), as are those from *E. coli* K-12 and *Salmonella* (Parker et al., 1992). Although basic BLASTP searches of the databases fail to identify significant similarities between *WaaP* and other proteins, PSI (Position-Specific Iterated) BLAST searches reveal that *WaaP* shares similarity with a vast number of kinases. The PSI-BLAST program aids in the identification of proteins with weak, but biologically relevant, sequence similarities in key positions throughout the proteins. Much of the chemical characterization of the *waaP* phenotype has been carried out using mutants of *S.* enterica serovars Typhimurium and Minnesota, and evaluation of the data is perhaps complicated by the fact that the prototype mutants are derived by chemical mutagenesis. As such, they potentially carry additional and unrecognized defects. Defined non-polar *waaP::aacC1* mutations in the *E. coli* R1 (Yethon et al., 1998) and *Salmonella* (J. A. Yethon and C. Whitfield, unpublished) core OS prototypes show a ‘deep-rough’ phenotype with respect to sensitivity to hydrophobic agents, despite the fact that the core OS is ‘capped’ with O-PS (J. A. Yethon et al., unpublished). However, the efficiency of ‘capping’ is reduced in the *Salmonella* and *E. coli* R1 *waaP::aacC1* mutants compared with wild type. This finding is in agreement with some, but not all, previously reported *Salmonella waaP* mutants. Given the similarities in protein sequences and inner core OS structures, radical differences between the biosynthesis of the heptose region in *Salmonella* and *E. coli* would be surprising. The inner core OS heptose region the *E. coli* R1 *waaP::aacC1* mutant is completely devoid of phosphate and 2-aminoethyl diphosphate (Yethon et al., 1998) as is the equivalent mutant in *Salmonella* (J. A. Yethon et al., unpublished).

Each of the *waaQ* operons from *E. coli* and *Salmonella* encode a well-conserved *WaaY* homologue (67.4–99.5% total similarity). The relative position of *waaY* is conserved in all but *E. coli* R3 (Fig. 3). Database searches reveal that *WaaY* shares no similarity with known glycosyltransferases and consistent with this, the carbohydrate structure of an *E. coli* R1 *waaY::aacC1* mutant is indistinguishable from the wild-type structure. PSI-BLAST searches of the databases reveal that *WaaY*, like *WaaP*, possesses characteristic features of kinase proteins. Moreover, *WaaY* proteins

share limited similarity with WaaP proteins. Analysis of the phosphorylation of the R1 waaY::aacC1 mutant revealed that while HepI remained phosphorylated with both phosphate and pyrophosphorylethanolamine, phosphoryl substituents on HepII were absent (Yethon et al., 1998). This would suggest that WaaY is the enzyme responsible for HepII phosphorylation and that the activity of the WaaP enzyme is a prerequisite to WaaY function.

Several important questions still remain about the phosphorylation of the heptose region. (i) What is the substrate donor of phosphoryl substituents? Soluble enzyme fractions from strains of S. enterica serovars Typhimurium and Minnesota both catalyse the transfer of [γ-32P]-ATP into S. enterica serovar Minnesota acceptor LPS (Schnaitman and Klena, 1993). There is also preliminary evidence (Hasin and Kennedy, 1982) that supports phosphatidylethanolamine as the direct donor of 2-aminoethyl phosphate (PEtN) residues into the inner core OS, but this would require prior addition of a phosphate to give PPEtN (Fig. 2). Does the diversity of substituents (P and PPEtN; Fig. 2) then arise by incomplete substitution or by a processing reaction as suggested by others (Schnaitman and Klena, 1993)? (ii) Is it possible that the same enzyme system that modifies Hep residues modifies KdolI as well? Modification of KdolI with PEtN has not been investigated in defined waaP or waaY mutants. (iii) There is no direct evidence that identifies WaaP or WaaY as a phosphorylating enzyme *per se*. Could it be that WaaP and WaaY are enzymes in a pathway including other, as yet unidentified, players?

Assembly of the outer core OS – HexI, HexII and HexIII glycosyltransferases

Detailed analysis of many of the outer core OS glycosyltransferases is limited by the lack of biochemical data derived from purified enzymes and structurally defined acceptors and/or reaction products. In fact, demonstration of enzyme activity is limited to WaaG in E. coli K-12 and WaaB and Waal in Salmonella (reviewed in Schnaitman and Klena, 1993). In general, gene assignments result from chemical characterization of mutant LPS and heterologous complementation studies with cloned genes. This is not always possible or interpretable because of variations in outer core OS structure. The E. coli R1 prototype is the only system for which precise non-polar insertions have been made in each of the outer core glycosyltransferase genes and for which the resulting core OS structures have been determined (Heinrichs et al., 1998a). Using the expanded list of known enzymes and sequence features discussed below, assignment of HexII and HexIII transferases becomes possible. However, the existing nomenclature for the HexII and HexIII transferases is illogical. For example, the gene designations are the same in E.

coli K-12 and Salmonella, despite the fact that the enzymes have different specificities. For this reason, we have proposed that the genes for novel specificities be given unique designations (Table 1). A new name has also been given to the E. coli K-12 gene that is responsible for the unique HexIII side-branch substitution for the same reason. Salmonella nomenclature is accorded priority because it was in this organism that the mutations were first characterized.

In all of the E. coli and Salmonella core OS, HexI is a Glc residue. Biochemical data, LPS structure and homologous gene complementation experiments identify WaaG as the UDP-glucose:(heptosyl) lipopolysaccharide α1,3-glucosyltransferase in E. coli K-12 and Salmonella (reviewed in Schnaitman and Klena, 1993). As expected, the six known homologues of the HexI glycosyltransferase, WaaG, are highly conserved (>85% identity).

There is biochemical evidence supporting the assignment of waal as the structural gene for the HexII transferase (UDP-galactose:(glucosyl) lipopolysaccharide α1,3-galactosyltransferase) in Salmonella (Schnaitman, and Klena, 1993). Although WaaJ is accepted as the HexIII transferase, the existing data are equivocal. Genes in similar positions to waal and waaJ in other clusters encode related proteins (Fig. 3). Non-polar insertion mutations in the genes for the HexII and HexIII transferases of E. coli R1 (waaO and waaT respectively) give the predicted truncated core OS structures and confirm these assignments (Heinrichs et al., 1998a; Fig. 3).

Relationships between the predicted HexII and HexIII transferases of E. coli K-12 and Salmonella were initially obscured by problems with the published DNA sequence, but resequencing of the waalJ region in Salmonella identified genes with similar sizes to the equivalent genes in E. coli K-12 (Heinrichs et al., 1998b). It is now apparent that all of the putative HexII and HexIII transferases share significant similarities (collectively 15.4% identity, 41.3% total similarity), as might be expected because all bind a nucleotide diphosphohexose precursor and transfer to a hexose residue in the acceptor. When grouped separately, the HexII transferases are closer to themselves (35.2% identity; 68.3% similarity) than they are to the HexIII transferases (27.2%; 50.8%). Predictably, when transferases with identical acceptor and donor specificities are considered, these values range from as low as 42.6% identity (57.5% similarity) up to as high as 99.7% identity. Most of the HexII and HexIII transferases are similar in length (≈330–340 residues). The exception is the HexIII transferase of E. coli R3 (see below). All of the HexII and HexIII transferases contain characteristic motifs (Fig. 4) that are absent in WaaG proteins. Some of the core OS α-glycosyltransferases [including WaaG, WaaB and WaaK (Heinrichs et al., 1998b), as well as WaaA, WaaZ and WaaD, see below] contain the motif E-(X<sub>7</sub>)-E. This motif was originally thought to be characteristic of

Fig. 4. Consensus features of the WaaIJ family of α-glycosyltransferases involved in outer core OS biosynthesis. These motifs were identified by multiple sequence alignments (Heinrichs et al., 1998).

α-glycosyltransferases (Geremia et al., 1996), but this conclusion is complicated by the discovery of the motif in virtually all of the core OS biosynthesis enzymes, including WaaP and WaaY proteins, which are clearly not glycosyltransferases, and WaaX and WaaV, which are β-glycosyltransferases (see below). Putative heptosyltransferases (WaaC, WaaF and WaaU) also have copies of the motif and its role remains an interesting but unanswered question. Clearly, care should be taken in the interpretation of this motif.

Assembly of the outer core OS – Hexl substitution
Hexl substitution in the core OS of E. coli K-12, R2 and Salmonella occurs in the form of α1,6-linked galactose. Biochemical data identify WaaB as the UDP-galactose: (glucosyl)lipopolysaccharide α1,6-galactosyltransferase. The waaB mutation in Salmonella can be complemented with waaB genes from Salmonella and E. coli K-12 (Schnaitman and Klena, 1993). The three known WaaB proteins are highly conserved (75.5–95.3% total similarity) and share a similar location in their respective gene clusters (Fig. 3).

Assembly of the outer core OS – Hexlll substitution
The Hexlll (Glc) residues of the Salmonella and E. coli R2 core OS are substituted with an α1,2-linked GlcNAc residue (Fig. 3). This substitution is non-stoichiometric in the E. coli R2 core OS (Heinrichs et al., 1998b). As might be expected, the WaaK enzymes from Salmonella and E. coli R2 are closely related (73.7% identity, 83.2% total similarity) and are capable of cross-complementation. The GlcNAc transferase activity has been confirmed directly for the E. coli R2 homologue (Heinrichs et al., 1998b). It is this gene that is presumably replaced to yield the novel core OS structure in S. enterica serovar Arizonae Illa O62 (Fig. 3).
The corresponding Hexlll residue in E. coli K-12 is partially substituted at the C-6 position with the terminal disaccharide β-D-GlcNAc-(1→7)-L-α-D-Hep (Fig. 3) (Brade et al., 1996). One would not expect the glycosyltransferase catalysing the Hexlll substitution to be conserved between Salmonella (or E. coli R2; WaaK) and E. coli K-12 (WaaU) and this is indeed the case. BLASTP searches of the databases identify regions of local similarity shared by WaaU and a variety of heptosyltransferases (Heinrichs et al., 1998b), suggesting that WaaU is probably involved in the addition of the HepIV substitution in E. coli K-12. However, the possibility that the WaaU protein is involved in the substitution of the HepIV residue with a β-linked GlcNAc residue should not be ruled out, and we have illustrated this in Fig. 3. Clearly, more work is required to resolve which genes are involved in the attachment of the terminal sugars of the K-12 core OS. The Hexlll position in E. coli R1 and R4 (Gal) is substituted by α1,2-Gal, and the glycosyltransferase involved has recently been determined to be WaaW by structural analysis of a waaW::aacC1 mutant of R1. The WaaW proteins of R1 and R4 are 93% identical.

A single glycosyltransferase change defines core structure specificity in *E. coli* R1 and R4

The R1 and R4 core OS are identical with respect to backbone structure and the α1,2-Gal substituent on HexIII and, as would be expected, the relevant gene products all show >95% identity. These two structures differ in the β-linked substituent at HexII (Fig. 3). The predicted products of *waaV* in *E. coli* R1 and *waaX* in *E. coli* R4 show only low levels of similarity (20.2% identity; 36.0% total similarity). However, they do show characteristic consensus sequence features and are members of two distinct families of β-glycosyltransferases (Heinrichs *et al.*, 1998a). The core OS structure in an *E. coli* R1 *waaV::aacC1* mutant and those in the mutant expressing either *waaV* or *waaX* have been determined. These analyses definitively identified *waaV* and *waaX* as the structural genes for the β-glycosyltransferases that define the R1 and R4 outer core OS structure (Heinrichs *et al.*, 1998a). The relatively low levels of similarity in the HexII-substituting β-glycosyltransferases is a marked contrast to the high levels of conservation in the rest of the R1 and R4 core OS biosynthesis genes. These data suggest that the structural diversity between R1 and R4 probably results from acquisition and replacement of one open reading frame, rather than by sequence drift. Interestingly, the addition of the β-linked substituent at HexII occurs as the last step in core OS assembly and is eliminated in a mutant lacking the HexIII substitution (Heinrichs *et al.*, 1998a).

existence of an additional gene located outside the *waa* cluster. Alternatively, one of the already identified enzymes may play a more complicated role. Interestingly, sequence data from the *E. coli* R3 prototype strain (F653) and from clinical R3 isolates revealed that the predicted *waaJ* gene product is truncated by ≈150 amino acid residues at the N-terminus compared with other HexII and HexIII transferases (D. E. Heinrichs and C. Whitfield, unpublished). This may result from a rearrangement leading to a reversal in the relative orders of *waaJ* and *waaY* (Fig. 3). The truncated R3 WaaJ protein lacks the first motif identified in the WaalJ family of proteins (see Fig. 4), and it is conceivable that this change leads to a processive glycosyltransferase enzyme which adds two α1,2-linked Glc residues, instead of the typical single residue.

What is the mechanism involved in ligation of O-PS to lipid A-core acceptor?

Current data predict that the ligation reaction, which joins newly synthesized O-PS to lipid A core, occurs at the periplasmic face of the plasma membrane (reviewed in Whitfield *et al.*, 1997). The mechanism involved has not been resolved and the *waaL* gene product is the only enzyme known to be required for ligation. The ligation-deficient phenotype of a *waaL* mutant was first established in *Salmonella*, then later in *E. coli* K-12, and has been confirmed for chromosomal *waaL::aacC1* insertion mutants in both *E. coli* R2 (Heinrichs *et al.*, 1998b) and *E. coli* R1 (Heinrichs *et al.*, 1998a). The ligase enzyme, or enzyme complex, is essentially a glycosyltransferase with a complex substrate requirement. However, the WaaL homologues contain none of the currently known glycosyltransferase features. This is not unexpected because their substrates are not nucleotide diphosphosugars. The WaaL primary sequences offer no obvious clues about function. In multiple alignments, the six known WaaL proteins collectively share only low levels of similarity in their primary sequences, but their higher order structures have common features. All of the WaaL proteins are predicted to be integral membrane proteins with eight or more membrane-spanning domains and their hydropathy profiles are virtually identical; they share hydrophobic domains of similar length and distribution. In contrast, outer core OS glycosyltransferases are all predicted to be peripheral membrane proteins. These features may reflect differences in their substrate specificities (i.e. nucleotide diphosphosugars for glycosyltransferases or undecaprenol-linked oligosaccharides for ligases).

The WaaL protein probably functions as part of a complex that involves highly specific interactions with O-PS biosynthetic intermediates on undecaprenol-P-P and lipid A-core acceptor. As part of this complex, WaaL proteins would be involved in specific protein–carbohydrate

A ‘missing’ transferase for assembly of the *E. coli* R3 core OS

The *E. coli* R3 core OS is of some interest because it is found in *E. coli* J5, which provides the LPS antigen for many significant (and sometimes controversial) immunological studies involving poly-and monoclonal antibodies. Sequence similarities in the predicted proteins readily facilitate identification of the HexII and HexIII transferases in *E. coli* R3. However, despite the fact that the *E. coli* R3 outer core OS has two side-group substitutions, only one additional transferase gene is found in the cluster (Fig. 3). The *waaD* gene occupies a position normally expected for an outer core OS function, and its product shares ≈70% total similarity (57% identity) with the GlcNAc transferase (Waak) common to *Salmonella* and *E. coli* R2, strongly suggesting that WaaD forms the HexII substitution in *E. coli* R3. However, this interpretation is complicated by the presence of an additional partial GlcNAc modification of HepIII, which, to date, is unique to *E. coli* R3 among the *E. coli* core OS. The gene required for the additional outer core OS substituent in *E. coli* R3 (an α1,2-Glc substitution of HexIII) remains unidentified. There are two potential interpretations of these observations. One is clearly the

interactions, and this may explain the diversity in WaaL primary sequences. Ligase enzymes show no obvious specificity for the structure of the ligated polysaccharide, possibly because these may be presented for ligation in a common undecaprenol-P-P-linked form. This has led to the widespread success in cloning O-PS biosynthesis gene clusters from heterologous species and expressing the O-PS on the surface of *E. coli* K-12. The known core types of *E. coli* and *Salmonella* are all capable of being efficiently ‘capped’ by the same prototype O-PS (*D*-galactan I of *Klebsiella pneumoniae* O1) (D. E. Heinrichs and C. Whitfield, unpublished). Furthermore, *E. coli* WaaL is required for the attachment of type I capsular polysaccharide and one form of enterobacterial common antigen (ECA) to the same core OS (for further discussion see Whitfield *et al.*, 1997).

The nature of the acceptor molecule is certainly important for ligation. Indeed, ligation activity is eliminated in an *E. coli* R2 *waaK::aacC1* mutant, in a *Salmonella waaK* mutant, and in an *E. coli* K-12 derivative lacking the equivalent HexIII substitution (MacLachlan *et al.*, 1991; Klена *et al.*, 1992; Heinrichs *et al.*, 1998b). The HexIII side-branch residue is present in R2 core OS carrying ligated O-PS (Gamian *et al.*, 1992), although the possibility that the HexIII side-branch residue may be trimmed away during the ligation step in some other core OS-type acceptor molecules has been suggested for *S.* enterica serovar Arizonae IIIa (discussed in Olsthoorn *et al.*, 1998). The finding that partial ligation activity results from complementation of the *E. coli* K-12 *waaL* mutant with the R2 *waaL* gene indicates that the structural requirement for a terminal side-group can be fulfilled by different residues and argues against a role for the precise core OS backbone structure in determining acceptor specificity (Heinrichs *et al.*, 1998b).

Attempts to establish relationships in WaaL sequences based on potential acceptor structures do not give a consistent pattern. The *E. coli* R2 and *Salmonella* WaaL homologues link an O-PS to the same substituted Glc (HexIII) residue (Fig. 3) and the proteins are closely related (65.8% identity, 81.1% total similarity) and functionally interchangeable (Heinrichs *et al.*, 1998b). If the attachment site on core OS is conserved, the R3 and K-12 WaaL enzymes should attach O-PS to the same HexIII residue. However, the R3 homologue resembles those from R2 and *Salmonella* (50–66% identity) and shares minimal identity with the K-12 enzyme. In terms of function, the *waaL* gene of *E. coli* K-12 shows no complementation of the *Salmonella waaL* defect (Klena *et al.*, 1992), suggesting that the *Salmonella* core OS is not a suitable acceptor for the K-12 ligase. In the converse experiments, *E. coli* K-12 and *Salmonella* core OS serve as acceptors with varying efficiencies for the *E. coli* R2 ligase (Heinrichs *et al.*, 1998b). These data reflect the complex acceptor

requirements for ligase activity. Recent studies in our laboratory have identified the HexII side-branch substituent (β1,3-linked Glc) as the attachment site for O-PS to an R1-type core OS. *E. coli* R1 *waaV::aacC1* mutants (lacking only the β1,3-linked Glc residue in the core OS) fail to ligate O-PS to lipid A core (Heinrichs *et al.*, 1998a). This represents a fundamental difference from the O-PS attachment site of the core OS of *Salmonella* and *E. coli* R2. Although the *E. coli* R1 and R4 WaaL homologues are related (33.1% identity; 54% total similarity), the values are low given that (i) most of the Waa proteins in the *E. coli* R1 and R4 systems are virtually identical; and (ii) the *E. coli* R1 and R4 systems share the distinction of having the *waaL* gene as the last gene of the *waaQ* operon, rather than the terminus of the *gmhD* operon (Fig. 3). Differences between these proteins are expected, given that the R4 core OS does not contain a β1,3-linked Glc residue in its core OS. It is interesting to speculate that the linkage of O-PS to an R4-type core OS is the β1,4-linked Gal residue. The location of this residue as well as its anomeric configuration are features in common with the attachment site in R1 core OS molecules. Similarities within the R1 and R4 WaaL proteins may be attributable to these conserved features. Efforts to understand the broader structural requirements and mechanism of ligation are underway in this laboratory.

In *Salmonella* and *E. coli* K-12, putative functions have been assigned to many of the core biosynthesis genes based on their ability to complement known core defects, or by similarity to other genes of known function. Such analyses have not been informative for *waaS* and *waaZ* of *E. coli* K-12. Although similar in size and located at an identical position, the *waaS* and *wabA* genes from *E. coli* K-12 and R2, respectively, predict proteins with negligible similarity. The R2 WabA protein contains most of the features characteristic of the HexII, HexIII and related transferases (Fig. 4) and is therefore predicted to use a UDP-hexose precursor. The K-12 WaaS protein does not contain any identifiable glycosyltransferase motifs and the sequence variation in the predicted WaaS and WabA proteins could reflect different transferase specificities. Significantly, the *E. coli* K-12 and R2 core OS are distinguished by the presence of non-stoichiometric α1,5-Rha and α1,7-Gal substituents on KdolI respectively (Fig. 2). We believe that the WabA and WaaS proteins are involved in these modifications and structural studies are underway with LPS from an *E. coli* R2 *wabA::aacC1* mutant to test this hypothesis.

The predicted WaaZ proteins, identified in *Salmonella*, and *E. coli* K-12 and R2 share 81.1–91.4% total similarity. The phenotype of a precise *waaZ* mutation has not yet been clearly established but the conservation in WaaZ, together with its presence in *Salmonella* argue against it being involved in variable substitutions of the core OS

structure. WaaZ has no sequence features that provide any additional clues to its function. The only unassigned function in core OS assembly is the addition of KdolI and it will be interesting to see if WaaZ plays any role in this.

Is there a separable ‘LOS pathway’ in the Enterobacteriaceae?

It has been suggested that WaaS and WaaZ together with WaaQ (heptosyltransferase III) play an integral role in the production of two forms of LPS in *E. coli* K-12: the classical LPS form that contains O-PS and an ‘LOS form’ distinct from R-LPS and that is destined to terminate without O-PS addition (Schnaitman and Klena, 1993). To date, this interesting proposal is based primarily on the banding patterns of *E. coli* K-12 R-LPS derivatives in SDS–PAGE analysis, and no firm conclusions can be made because of the lack of chemical and enzymatic data.

One might expect that an alternative system for the production of an ‘LOS form’ of LPS would not be confined to *E. coli* K-12. *E. coli* R2 and *Salmonella* are the only other core types that possess a *waaZ* homologue, and only *E. coli* R2 has an additional gene (*wabA*) in an equivalent position to *waaS* (Fig. 3). However, strains with the most clinically prevalent core types (*E. coli* R1 and R3) are missing the *waaS*, *wabA* and/or *waaZ*. They therefore lack these components of the putative ‘LOS pathway’. This raises important questions concerning the biological role of the alternative pathway. It is possible that an ‘LOS’ system is confined to *E. coli* K-12 and R2, although the existence of homologues of these genes outside the core OS biosynthesis gene cluster cannot be ruled out. Nevertheless, the possibility of an ‘LOS pathway’ remains an intriguing hypothesis and warrants further investigation.

### Concluding remarks

It should be apparent from the above discussion that knowledge of the enzymes involved in core OS assembly has progressed substantially in recent years. Although we can now assign roles to many of the gene products, their precise mechanisms of action remain elusive in the absence of biochemical data. These limitations should certainly be considered when the Enterobacteriaceae systems are used as a basis for interpretation of data from other bacterial species. Among the unanswered questions are the following. (i) Is there a mechanism that diverts specific lipid A-core acceptors out of an O-PS substitution pathway? If so, how is this regulated and what is its impact on pathogenicity? (ii) How does WaaL operate, and are there other unidentified components in the ligation reaction? (iii) How are the critical phosphoryl derivatives put in place in the core OS? (iv) How are the individual enzymes for core assembly organized into a functional complex? (v) How important are specific protein–protein interactions, and to what extent would the system tolerate heterologous enzymes? The reagents, techniques, and sequences of many *waa* homologues are now available to address these important and unresolved issues in the assembly of the bacterial cell envelope. Despite the open questions that remain, *E. coli* and *Salmonella* continue to provide a solid foundation for further work in other bacteria.
