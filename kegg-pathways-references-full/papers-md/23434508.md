### SUMMARY

To elucidate the structural basis of the mechanism of microtubule depolymerization by kinesin-13s, we analyzed complexes of tubulin and the *Drosophila melanogaster* kinesin-13 KLP10A by electron microscopy (EM) and fluorescence polarization microscopy. We report a nanometer-resolution (1.1 nm) cryo-EM three-dimensional structure of the KLP10A head domain (KLP10AHD) bound to curved tubulin. We found that binding of KLP10AHD induces a distinct tubulin configuration with displacement (shear) between tubulin subunits in addition to curvature. In this configuration, the kinesin-binding site differs from that in straight tubulin, providing an explanation for the distinct interaction modes of kinesin-13s with the microtubule lattice or its ends. The KLP10AHD-tubulin interface comprises three areas of interaction, suggesting a crossbow-type tubulin-bending mechanism. These areas include the kinesin-13 family conserved KVD residues, and as predicted from the crossbow model, mutating these residues changes the orientation and mobility of KLP10AHDs interacting with the microtubule.

### INTRODUCTION

Kinesins are a superfamily of microtubule (MT)-associated ATPases characterized by the presence of a highly conserved catalytic or “motor” head domain (HD, ~340 residues long) containing MT- and ATP-binding sites (*Goldstein and Philp*, 1999). Although most kinesins work as motile molecular motors generating force and movement along MTs, some kinesins act as MT depolymerases. The latter group includes the kinesin-13 family members, which were the first to be clearly recognized as non-motile kinesins with MT depolymerase activity (*Desai et al.*, 1999).

Kinesin-13s have been reported to play important roles in various cellular processes, including mitosis (*Manning et al.*, 2007; *Rogers et al.*, 2004), cytokinesis (*Rankin and Wordeman*, 2010), axonal branching (*Homma et al.*, 2003), and ciliogenesis (*Kobayashi et al.*, 2011). Kinesin13s have also attracted considerable attention as potential targets for anticancer therapy due to their effects on MT dynamics and their involvement in mitosis (*Sanhaji et al.*, 2011).

Although much work has been devoted to elucidating the mechanism of action of kinesin motors, it is still not fully clear why some are motile and others are MT depolymerases. The molecular mechanism of kinesin-13 MT depolymerization likely involves the stabilization of a curved tubulin structure, which is incompatible with the formation of lateral interprotofilament contacts in the MT lattice (*Desai et al.*, 1999). However, how kinesin-13s induce tubulin curvature is not well understood. Catalytic activity is coupled to ATP hydrolysis (*Hunter et al.*, 2003) as in other kinesins, but the interaction of kinesin-13s with MTs is very different from that of motile kinesins. Motile kinesins alternate between strong and weak interactions with tubulin as they translocate along the MT lattice. On the other hand, kinesin-13s bind to the MT lattice weakly and undergo unbiased one-dimensional (1D) diffusion until they reach the end of the MT, where they induce depolymerization (*Helenius et al.*, 2006). How kinesin-13 distinguishes tubulin in the MT lattice or at the MT ends is unknown.

As with motile kinesins, many key kinesin-13 functions, such as ATP hydrolysis and tubulin binding, are located in the kinesin-13 HD, but additional areas outside the HD are also functionally important (*Hertzer et al.*, 2006; *Maney et al.*, 2001). A positively charged, ~60-residue-long sequence N-terminal to the HD, known as the neck, promotes MT binding (*Cooper et al.*, 2010) and is critical for normal in vivo MT depolymerization (*Ovechkina et al.*, 2002). The neck may also increase MT depolymerization efficiency by inducing the two HDs of a full-length kinesin-13 dimer to bind adjacent protofilaments (*Mulder et al.*, 2009). However, the kinesin-13 HD alone has the ability to induce tubulin curvature and depolymerize MTs (*Moores et al.*, 2002; *Tan et al.*, 2008). Thus, elucidating how the kinesin-13 HD in particular binds to and bends tubulin is crucial for understanding the mechanism of kinesin-13-mediated MT depolymerization.

Previous lower-resolution electron microscopy (EM) studies have indicated that the kinesin-13 HD binds to curved tubulin in a configuration that is similar to other kinesin HDs bound to straight tubulin in the MT lattice (*Tan et al.*, 2008). This similarity makes it difficult to explain how the kinesin-13 HD binds to and bends tubulin. To address this problem, we analyzed the structure of several complexes of tubulin and the *Drosophila*

melanogaster kinesin-13 KLP10AHD using EM and fluorescence polarization microscopy (FPM). Our data identify the kinesin-13 HD binding site on the tubulin intradimer interface, reveal a novel tubulin conformation, and provide an intriguing explanation for the distinct modes of interaction of kinesin-13s with straight or curved tubulin. We propose that the kinesin-13 HD induces a curved-sheared (CS) tubulin configuration by a crossbow-type bending mechanism. In this mechanism, the kinesin-13 HD bends the tubulin dimer by pulling the two tubulin subunits relative to the intradimer interface.

RESULTS

KLP10AHD Binds to the Intradimer Interface

A critical missing piece of information regarding the molecular mechanism of kinesin-13-induced MT depolymerization is the location of the kinesin-13 HD binding site on tubulin. Due to the similarity between α- and β-tubulin, it has not been possible to distinguish whether the kinesin-13 HD binds the tubulin inter-

and tubulin subunits. Overall, these results indicate that the ATP state stabilizes the tightest interaction of KLP10AHD with curved tubulin, followed by the transition ADP-Pi state. Nucleotide-dependent conformational changes result in a weakening of the interaction until the complex is dissociated, likely after ATP hydrolysis product release (in the ADP or NN condition, or during ADP/ATP exchange).

### Nanometer-Resolution Structure of a Kinesin-13-Tubulin Depolymerization Intermediate

To gain molecular-level insight into the mechanism by which kinesin-13 induces tubulin curvature, we used cryo-EM and image analysis to obtain a three-dimensional (3D) structure of KLP10AHD in complex with curved tubulin. We took advantage of the discovery that when MTs are incubated in the presence of kinesin-13 constructs and nonhydrolyzable ATP analogs, spirals consisting of a curved tubulin protofilament and bound kinesin-13s can wrap around MTs (Moores et al., 2006; Tan et al., 2006). These spirals can form very uniform helical arrays suitable for 3D reconstruction. By increasing the number of images and applying single-particle analysis procedures, we increased the resolution to ~11 Å (Figure S3) from a previous 28 Å resolution map (Tan et al., 2008). At this improved resolution, some exposed secondary structure elements can be resolved and a more precise fitting of the different protein subunits constituting the complex can be achieved (Figure 3; Movie S1).

The KLP10AHD in the spirals has two areas of interaction with tubulin positioned at opposite sides of the HD (Figure 3C). We refer to these areas as Kin-Tub-1 and Kin-Tub-2 (Tan et al., 2008). We will focus our description here on the Kin-Tub-1 interface because this is the one that is present in the isolated ring and spiral complexes (Figures 1 and 2) and is involved in stabilizing tubulin curvature. The Kin-Tub-1 interface can be separated into three distinct areas going from the tubulin plus end to the minus end: area 1, containing kinesin loop 8 (L8); area 2, containing kinesin α-helix 4 (α4); and area 3, containing kinesin loop 2 (L2). Close-ups of these three areas, indicating likely

Labels are also color-coded according to location (blue, KLP10AHD; red, α-tubulin; green, β-tubulin). See also Figures S3, S5, and Movies S1 and S6.

interacting secondary structure elements in KLP10AHD and tubulin, are shown in Figures 3D–3F. Area 2, in addition to α4, also includes kinesin loop 11 (L11), which is disordered and not resolved in most kinesin crystal structures. This region is one of two regions commonly found in kinesins, myosins, and G-proteins that change conformation depending on the nucleotide species that is present on the active site ([Kull and Endow, 2002](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0968-0004(02)00570-2)). L2, in the third area, is a loop that is elongated in the kinesin-13 family and contains the class-conserved KVD sequence at the tip. Mutating these three residues severely disrupts depolymerization activity ([Ogawa et al., 2004](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2004.03.020); [Shipley et al., 2004](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2004.03.021)). We found that KLP10AHD constructs with the KVD residues mutated to AAA were unable to form tubulin ring complexes, highlighting the critical role that this area plays in kinesin-13’s ability to bend tubulin and induce MT depolymerization. The elongated L2 characteristically sticks out from the core of the kinesin-13 HD and is very well resolved in the cryo-EM density map (Figure 3F). Thus, its location when bound to curved tubulin is very well determined in the fitted model of the KLP10AHD-tubulin ring complex. The tip of L2 is at the interdimer interface and is likely to form binding interactions to residues in the α-tubulin subunit of the dimer, to which the rest of the HD is bound, and to the β-tubulin subunit of the next heterodimer toward the minus end of the protofilament (Figures 3C and 3F).

The structure of straight tubulin does not fit well into the density of the outside curved protofilament (Figure 4A), as would be expected. A good fit is only achieved when α- and β-tubulin monomers are allowed to fit independently. In this fitted tubulin structure, there is a bend between monomers relative to the configuration of straight tubulin (Figure 4; Movie S2). The fitting also reveals an unexpected displacement (shear) between the tubulin subunits (Figure 4, right; Movie S3). This curved and sheared heterodimer is a tubulin structure that is considerably different from previously described straight or curved tubulin structures (Figure S4). We will refer to this structure as CS tubulin.

A detailed comparison of the 3D map with the fitted atomic structures also reveals small areas with a less than perfect fit. In these areas, there is density in the 3D EM map with no corresponding atomic structures from the fitted atomic structures or atoms with no corresponding density (Figure 3; Movie S1). At the present resolution, it cannot be fully established whether such differences correspond to local conformational changes or areas that are disordered in the crystal structures becoming ordered in the complex. In the tubulin atomic structures, there are 12–16 residues missing (disordered) at the C-terminal end and most residues in kinesin L11 and L12 are also missing. Despite the small fitting mismatches, the overall positions and orientation of all the fitted protein subunits can be determined with high accuracy.

In order to estimate the accuracy with which our cryo-EM 3D map and molecular fitting procedure support the CS-tubulin structure, we made 18 independent fits to maps calculated from separate data sets or different asymmetric units in a non-helically averaged map. The relative positions of all the individual subunits in the resulting 18 models were very similar, and all tubulins in the outside ring showed curvature and shear (Figure S5). We estimated an accuracy in determining the relative position between protein subunits of better than 2.3 Å, which is much smaller than the distance between corresponding tubulin monomers (16 Å) when we compare CS-tubulin with straight or curved tubulin. Thus, the 3D map and fitting procedure provide strong evidence for the CS-tubulin conformation.

A consequence of the curve and shear between tubulin monomers in CS-tubulin is that the Kin-Tub-1 interface is very different from the analogous interface between other kinesin HDs and straight tubulin (Figures 4B and 4C; Movie S4). KLP10A and kinesin-1 interact with some of the same residues of α- and β-tubulin, with the notable exception of the residues toward the α-tubulin minus end that interact with the kinesin-13-specific elongated L2. Despite including similar residues, the kinesin-binding sites are different due to the different displacement between the α- and β-tubulin subunits in straight and CS-tubulin. We propose that this structural difference forms the basis of the distinct interactions of kinesins with straight tubulin at the MT lattice or curved tubulin at MT ends. Motile kinesins are adapted to interact with straight tubulin, whereas kinesin-13s are adapted to interact with curved tubulin. This adaption in the case of kinesin-13s includes the elongated L2, which binds to α-tubulin and orients the motor domain in such a way that the other interacting areas (α-4, L11, L12, and L8) match the corresponding binding areas in CS-tubulin but not in straight tubulin.

The three interacting areas of the Kin-Tub-1-binding site suggest a crossbow-type mechanism for inducing tubulin curvature (see Figure 6A) where the regions at the extreme of the interface (kinesin L8 and L2) pull the plus and minus ends of the tubulin heterodimer relative to the center region (kinesin α4-L11). One can visualize this kinesin-13-induced tubulin curvature process by comparing images of KLP10AHD-protofilament complexes with distinct curvature, or by comparing the atomic models of the KLP10AHD-CS-tubulin and kinesin-1-tubulin complexes (Movies S5 and S6).

## Interactions Involving Kinesin-13 L2 and α4 Mediate Weak Interactions with the MT Lattice

To investigate how kinesin-13 interacts with straight tubulin, we used FPM of fluorescently labeled KLP10AHD constructs bound to MTs. FPM allows one to obtain structural information (e.g., orientation and mobility) about proteins bound to the MT even with low occupancy or in disordered states, as may be expected from the relatively weaker interaction of kinesin-13 with the MT lattice (Wang et al., 2012).

We made several cys-light bis-(N-iodoacetyl)piperazinyl sulfonerodamine (BSR)-labeled KLP10A constructs (KLP10A-BSR). Figure 5A shows the location and orientation of the fluorescence transition dipole on KLP10AHD. This location is equivalent to the one used in previous work on the kinesin-1 HD (Asenjo et al., 2003; Sosa et al., 2001), which allows us to make comparisons between these different kinesins. We measured the linear dichroism (LD⁰) of ensembles of KLP10A-BSR molecules on MTs. The LD⁰ reports on the orientation and disorder (static or dynamic) of the probes relative to the MT axis (Sosa et al., 2010). We determined the LD⁰ of KLP10A-BSR constructs with or without mutations in the previously identified putative binding areas of KLP10AHD with CS tubulin. The cys-light construct with no additional mutations is named WT. The L2 mutant in which the kinesin-13-specific KVD residues were mutated to AAA is named the KVD mutant, and the L8 mutant is named D444A,K446A according to the residue substitutions made. We also investigated a kinesin α4 mutant

We measured the LD⁰ values of all the constructs in the presence of ADP or absence of nucleotides (NN) (Figure 5C). In these conditions, very few or no curved tubulin ring complexes should form, and thus the reported values should correspond mainly to KLP10A-BSR molecules interacting with the MT lattice.

The LD⁰ in most conditions is positive, indicating that the dipole probe is oriented on average nearly perpendicular to the MT axis (Figure 5C). This is similar to kinesin-1 labeled with the BSR probe in an equivalent location. However, the values are significantly lower for the NN state and higher for ADP. For conventional kinesin, ADP produces a weak, highly mobile state with an LD⁰ value near zero, whereas nucleotide depletion produces a strong rigor binding state with relatively low mobility (LD⁰ = 0.5 ± 0.06; Asenjo et al., 2003). The relative similarity in the LD⁰ values between different nucleotide conditions for KLP10A-BSR (0.2 and 0.3 versus 0 and 0.5 for conventional kinesin) indicates that the interaction of KLP10A-BSR with the MT lattice is less dependent on the nucleotide state than in the case of conventional kinesin. The lower LD⁰ value of KLP10A-BSR relative to conventional kinesin in the NN state indicates a slightly different orientation (probe closer to 54.7° from the MT axis) and/or a more disordered binding configuration for KLP10A-BSR (multiple conformations and/or mobility). We favor the second interpretation because it is consistent with the diffusive nature of kinesin-13's interaction with the MT lattice. The simplest interpretation of the data is that KLP10A-BSR cannot bind to the MT lattice in a well-defined orientation as does conventional kinesin. Instead, it binds weakly, with higher mobility and less dependence on the nucleotide state.

A weakly diffusive state could be the result of kinesin-13 switching between alternative binding sites as the molecule diffuses along the MT lattice. The effect of mutations on the putative CS-tubulin-binding site on the LD⁰ values provides further insights into how these regions participate in the interaction with straight tubulin. As explained above, the kinesin α4 KEC mutant did not bind well to MTs, indicating that α4 interactions are critical for KLP10A-BSR MT lattice binding. Mutating residues D444 and K446 to alanines in KLP10A L8 produced small changes in the binding configuration of KLP10A-BSR to the MT, as indicated by the lower LD⁰ values of this mutant relative to the control WT (Figure 5C). Mutations on equivalent residues on conventional kinesin reduce its affinity for MTs (Woehlke et al., 1997). Mutating the kinesin-13 class-conserved residues KVD to alanines in L2 does not abolish binding to the MT (Figure 5B, bottom panels), but produces a large effect on the configuration of the KLP10A-BSR MT complex. The LD⁰ in all nucleotide conditions falls to near zero for this mutant, consistent with a major increase in mobility or change in the average orientation of KLP10A-BSR relative to the MT. Therefore, kinesin-13 L2, in addition to being critical for stabilizing the CS-tubulin configuration (see previous section), also determines the binding orientation of the HD when bound to straight tubulin.

The FPM results are consistent with a model in which the KLP10A binds to straight tubulin in the MT lattice using the same structural elements (kinesin L2, α4, and L8) as when it is bound to CS tubulin (Figures 3C–3F), but with more mobility, perhaps alternating between the three binding areas. The contacts that dominate the interaction (in time and/or strength)

(B) FPM images of MTs decorated with BSR-labeled KLP10AHD. The two side-by-side images correspond to the same field but with different polarization directions of the excitation light (green arrows). The MTs are decorated with a control (WT) KLP10A-BSR construct in the top two images and with the KLP10A L2 KVD mutant in the bottom two. Note the higher fluorescence anisotropy in the top images relative to the bottom ones. In the top images, the fluorescence intensity is strongly dependent on the relative orientations of the MT axis and the excitation polarization direction (green arrow), i.e., more intense when it is perpendicular and less intense when it is parallel. This indicates that the fluorescence transition dipole is nearly perpendicular to the MT axis in the example shown in the top images, and is more disordered in the bottom ones (random orientations).

(C) Fluorescence polarization LD⁰ values (calculated from the ratio between fluorescence intensities with different excitation polarization directions) of KLP10A-BSR constructs in the presence of ADP or absence of nucleotides (NN). The value of the LD⁰ parameter depends on the average orientation of the BSR probe relative to the MT, with positive values indicating an average perpendicular orientation (90°–54.7°) from the MT axis. Increased orientational disorder from the average orientation has the effect of reducing |LD⁰| values (Sosa et al., 2010). Error bars represent the SD of the estimated LD⁰ values. Number of MTs analyzed: 492, 608, 294, 192, 616, and 520 for WT-ADP, WT-NN, D44A,K446A-ADP, D44A,K446A-NN, KVD-ADP, and KVD-NN, respectively.

in which the residues KEC were mutated to alanines. This KLP10A-BSR mutant did not decorate MTs well enough even for FPM analysis. This is consistent with a previous study (Shipley et al., 2004) indicating that this mutation severely disrupts MT depolymerization activity and MT binding.

Figure 5B shows typical FPM images with KLP10A-BSR-decorated MTs. Anisotropy can be clearly seen in the top images (corresponding to WT KLP10A-BSR), whereas the bottom ones (corresponding to the KVD mutant) show much less anisotropy.

Figure 6. Structural Model for Kinesin-13-Induced MT Depolymerization

(A) The interface between KLP10AHD and CS tubulin has three major areas of interaction along the tubulin heterodimer that suggest a crossbow-type mechanism for inducing tubulin curvature. In this model, middle interactions push the tubulin intradimer relative to the two extremes, producing tubulin curvature. Bending and shearing forces are represented as red and blue arrows, respectively.

(B) Mechanochemical model for the kinesin-13-tubulin complex. The nucleotide states of kinesin-13 in solution and while interacting with the MT lattice are according to previous work (Friel and Howard, 2011). The kinesin-motor domain binds weakly to the tubulin lattice through interactions involving kinesin L2, α4, and regions outside the motor domain such as the neck (not depicted here). The kinesin-13 HD cannot bind strongly to the MT lattice due to lack of complementarity with the binding site in straight tubulin. On the MT ends, kinesin-13 finds isolated protofilaments where it can induce/stabilize the CS-tubulin structure in the ATP state. Curved protofilaments stabilized by kinesin-13 binding cannot form lateral contacts with other protofilaments and eventually break from the MT ends. Release of ATP hydrolysis products results in dissociation of the kinesin-13 HD complex. Interactions of the kinesin-13 L2 with β-tubulin in the interdimer interface drive binding to a MT end protofilament over free tubulin in solution.

would be the ones in areas 2 and 3 (Figures 3D–3F), because mutations in these areas (kinesin α4 and L2) have the strongest effect on binding of KLP10A-BSR to the MT lattice. The tubulin-bending crossbow model (Figure 6A) would also predict a change in the average orientation/mobility of the motor domain relative to tubulin, consistent with the observed changes in LD⁰ when key residues in L2 or L8 are mutated (Figure 5C). Disrupting one of the two interaction points at the extremes of the binding interface (diagonal red arrows in Figure 6A) would alter the balance of forces and produce a change in the orientation of the HD relative to tubulin.

### DISCUSSION

We have produced a structural model for the kinesin-13 MT depolymerization mechanism based on EM and FPM data. In this model, binding interactions in three main areas of the kinesin-13 HD tubulin interface generate relative forces akin to a crossbow to stabilize or induce curvature between the α- and β-subunits of the tubulin heterodimer (Figure 6A). A nanometer-resolution structure of the kinesin-13 HD tubulin complex also revealed that in addition to curvature, there is considerable relative displacement (shear) between the tubulin subunits. We call this tubulin configuration CS-tubulin.

The CS-tubulin structure suggests a novel mechanism by which the kinesin-13 HD discriminates between straight and curved tubulin conformations. A previous model proposed that a more convex shape for the kinesin-13 HD was better suited to interact with the concave binding site of a curved tubulin (Ogawa et al., 2004). However, we find this concave-convex complementary model unsatisfactory because the curvature between tubulin subunits is relatively modest and the tubulin-binding site of kinesin 13s is no more convex than that of other kinesins (Figure S6). In our model, the key to the curved versus straight tubulin distinction lies in the presence of kinesin-binding sites at both sides of the tubulin intradimer interface. With this split binding surface, displacement between α- and β-tubulin results in a different binding site (Figures 4B and 4C). The elongated kinesin-13-specific L2 plays a critical role here because it creates a new contact point at the interdimer interface and orients the HD for proper matching of the other interacting areas with CS tubulin.

The formation of long, multimeric tubulin protofilaments with the KLP10AHD, as observed here (Figures 1, 2, and 3), indicates that the KLP10AHD stabilizes tubulin interdimer contacts in addition to inducing intradimer curvature. This effect may also be mediated by kinesin L2, because its tip is at the interdimer interface (Figures 3C and 3F). This interaction may give kinesin-13s a higher affinity for isolated protofilaments at the end of the MT compared with free tubulin, where interdimer interactions would be missing. This would provide a structural explanation for why kinesin-13s are efficient MT catastrophe promoters rather than polymerization inhibitors (Gardner et al., 2011).

A simple explanation for how kinesin-13s specifically recognize and depolymerize MT ends is that they recognize tubulin protofilaments with missing lateral contacts. In the absence of capping proteins, the MT ends will always have at least one tubulin subunit missing lateral contacts due to their helical arrangement. Also, in many conditions the MT ends are thought to have one or more protofilaments missing lateral contacts with their neighbors due to the formation of open sheets, protofilament curling, or different lengths of the protofilaments (Nogales and Wang, 2006). In the absence of lateral contacts, tubulin may be free to adopt the CS conformation and form a strong interaction with the HD of kinesin-13s. An alternative hypothesis is that kinesin-13 recognizes some structural

feature of GTP-tubulin, which is thought to cap the end of MTs (Zanic et al., 2009). However, the fact that we observed similar KLP10AHD tubulin rings in the presence of GDP, GTP, or nonhydrolizable GTP analogs argues against this possibility.

The process of kinesin-13-induced protofilament bending at the end of the MTs could occur by an induced fit or a conformational selection-type mechanism (Changeux and Edelstein, 2011). In the first case, interactions of the kinesin-13 HD in the ATP state with straight tubulin would promote a transition from straight to CS-tubulin concomitantly with the formation of a strong binding complex. This transition would only occur on isolated protofilaments where kinesin-13 could overcome the straightening force created by lateral tubulin interactions. In the second view, the kinesin-13 HD would stabilize a pre-existing CS-tubulin configuration. The probability of finding this pre-existing configuration would be higher in isolated protofilaments where the lack of stabilizing lateral protofilament contacts would allow tubulin to fluctuate between different conformations. In favor of a conformational selection-type mechanism is the fact that tubulin with curvature exists in the absence of kinesin-13s (Nogales and Wang, 2006). However, proving this mechanism will require determining whether the CS-tubulin structure in particular can exist outside a kinesin-13-tubulin complex. Currently, we favor a model that incorporates elements of both mechanisms (induced fit and conformational selection). A plausible sequence of events is that the kinesin-13 HD initially forms a complex with slightly curved protofilaments at the MT ends, and this interaction triggers further tubulin bending and shearing. The fact that KLP10AHD binds to tubulin protofilaments with a range of curvatures (Table 1; Movie S4) supports this view.

Our structural data can be combined with previously reported kinetic data (Friel and Howard, 2011; Wang et al., 2012) to obtain a mechanochemical cycle model for kinesin-13 (Figure 6B). In this model, the distinct effects of the MT ends or lattice on kinesin-13 activity are explained by the ability/inability to form all the three kinesin-13-tubulin interactions, as seen in the Kin-Tub1 interface of the KLP10AHD CS-tubulin complex (Figures 3C–3F). As indicated by our FPM data, the kinesin-13 HD binds to the MT lattice in a relatively mobile state mediated, at least in part, by interactions with the kinesin-13 L2 and α4. In this weakly bound state, kinesin-13 could undergo 1D diffusion toward either MT end (Helenius et al., 2006). At the MT ends, a kinesin-13 could arrive in either the ATP state (from solution) or the ADP state (by 1D diffusion along the MT lattice). Lack of lateral protofilament contacts at the MT ends would allow tubulin curvature and the kinesin-13 to form complementary binding at the three regions of the Kin-Tub-1 interface. ADP/ATP exchange of kinesins arriving in the ADP state from the MT lattice (Friel and Howard, 2011) may also be triggered during this process. The resulting stable kinesin-13-CS-tubulin complex would not be able to straighten spontaneously and reform lateral interprotofilament contacts, leading to MT end depolymerization. Following ATP hydrolysis and product release, the complex would dissociate, as suggested by the very small number or lack of KLP10AHD-curved tubulin complexes observed in the ADP and NN conditions (Table 1). Separation of individual tubulin dimers from the MT end protofilament could occur at this step by a yet to be defined additional conformational change. Alternatively, it could

occur as the curved protofilaments grow longer and become prone to breakage.

## EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES

### Protein Constructs

*D. melanogaster* KLP10A protein constructs were expressed and purified as previously described (Tan et al., 2006, 2008). The KLP10AHD construct includes KLP10A residues I279–I615. For FPM, we made several new constructs that include the KLP10A head and neck domains (residues T198–I615). Inclusion of the neck residues improved MT decoration. For site-specific labeling, all of the surface-exposed cysteines were replaced with alanines or other residues based on naturally occurring substitutions within the kinesin-13 family. Accordingly, we made the following substitutions: C282A, C339A, C389S, C548S, and C594V. Two residues were mutated to cysteines (T455C and D460C) for labeling with the bifunctional thiol-reactive fluorescence probe BSR (Molecular Probes). We call this basic construct WT. We verified that this WT construct retained kinesin-13’s ability to induce tubulin curvature. We prepared three mutant versions of this construct by replacing the following class-conserved residues: K317A, V318A, and D319A triple mutant (residues located in L2); D444A and K446A double mutant (residues located in L8); and K546A, E547A, C548A triple mutant (residues located in kinesin α4). All of the mutations were introduced into the plasmid vector using the Quik-Change Lightning Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent Technologies/Stratagene). The attachment location of the probe (crosslinking residues 455–460) was verified by trypsin digestion followed by mass spectrometry. Pig brain tubulin was purchased (Cytoskeleton) or purified in the laboratory according to standard protocols (Miller and Wilson, 2010).

### Single-Particle Negative-Staining EM

Tubulin (0.15 μM) was first mixed with the nucleotide species to be tested and then with an excess amount of KLP10AHD in cold BRB80 buffer (1 mM MgCl₂; 1 mM EGTA; 80 mM PIPES, pH = 6.8). The final concentrations of nucleotide depending on the experimental condition to be tested were as follows: AMP-PNP, 1 mM AMP-PNP (Sigma Aldrich); ADP, 1 mM ADP (Sigma Aldrich); NN, 5 U ml⁻¹ apyrase (Sigma Aldrich) and no added nucleotides; and ADP-AlF₄⁻, 4 mM ADP, 2 mM AlCl₃, and 10 mM KF. The mixture was incubated on ice for 1 min and then loaded onto carbon-coated copper grids. We also tested the effect of including different GTP analogs (GTP: 1 mM GTP [Sigma Aldrich]; GDP, 1 mM GDP [Sigma Aldrich]; GMPCPP: 1 mM GMPCPP [Jena Bioscience]; and GTP-γ-S, 1 mM GTP-γ-S [Cytoskeleton]). The grids with the KLP10AHD and tubulin mixtures were negatively stained with 1% uranyl acetate (Electron Microscopy Sciences). Electron micrographs were recorded on a TVIPS F224HD digital camera in an FEI Tecnai-20 microscope operated at 120 kV with a nominal magnification of 50KX (pixel size: 0.27 × 0.27 nm²).

### Cryo-EM

A suspension of the KLP10AHD-MT complex was applied onto freshly glow-discharged EM grids and flash frozen as previously described (Tan et al., 2008). Electron micrographs were recorded on film under low-dose conditions at a nominal magnification of 50,000 or 45,000 with a nominal defocus range of 1–2.5 μm on a Tecnai-F20 FEG cryo-electron microscope operated at 200 kV or on a JEOL 3200FSC operated at 300 kV. Electron micrographs were recorded on film under low-dose conditions and digitized for further analysis.

### Image Analysis and 3D Reconstruction

Negatively stained particle images of KLP10AHD tubulin complexes were digitized and subjected to multivariate statistical analysis, classification, and averaging (see Extended Experimental Procedures).

We carried out 3D reconstruction of helical 15-pf MTs with wrapped-around KLP10AHD tubulin protofilament spirals using a single-particle approach (see Extended Experimental Procedures).

### Molecular Fitting

We created atomic models by fitting the atomic structures of tubulin (Protein Data Bank ID code [PDB]: 1JFF; Löwe et al., 2001) and KLP10AHD into the
asymmetric unit of the 3D map using the fitmap function of UCSF-Chimera (Pettersen et al., 2004). The atomic coordinates of each protein subunit were fitted independently as rigid bodies (for further details see Figure S5 and corresponding legend). An atomic model of KLP10AHD was generated with MMM (Rai and Fiser, 2006) using the sequence of KLP10A and the crystal structure of the kinesin-13 KIF2C (PDB: 1V8K (Ogawa et al., 2004)).

**FPM**

Taxol-stabilized MTs were attached to glass coverslip flow chambers, and solutions with KLP10A fluorescent constructs were then flowed through the chamber to decorate the MTs as previously described (Asenjo and Sosa, 2009). Nucleotides were added in accordance with the experimental condition to be interrogated: ADP (2 mM) and NN (5 U ml⁻¹ apyrase with no nucleotide added) in BRB12 buffer (12 mM PIPES, 2 mM MgCl₂, 1 mM EGTA, and 20 μM Taxol, pH 6.8). Flow chambers were placed in a custom-modified microscope for fluorescence polarization observation and data recording. Ensemble fluorescence polarization data were recorded and analyzed as previously described (Sosa et al., 2010).
