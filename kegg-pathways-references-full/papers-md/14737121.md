HEDGEHOG SIGNALLING IN
CANCER FORMATION AND
MAINTENANCE

Marina Pasca di Magliano and Matthias Hebrok

The Hedgehog signalling pathway is essential for numerous processes during embryonic development. Members of this family of secreted proteins control cell proliferation, differentiation and tissue patterning in a dose-dependent manner. Although the overall activity of the pathway is diminished after embryogenesis, recent reports show that the pathway remains active in some adult tissues, including adult stem cells in the brain and skin. There is also evidence that uncontrolled activation of the pathway results in specific types of cancer.

Recent reports that uncontrolled activation of the Hedgehog (HH) signalling pathway results in distinct cancers of the brain, muscle and skin have received significant attention. The interest is partly because of the fact that deregulated HH signalling only seems to cause tumours in a subset of adult cell types — potentially a population of adult stem cells that might require HH signalling for their proliferation and maintenance. Furthermore, specific inhibition of this pathway blocks tumour growth, indicating that active HH signalling is essential for tumour survival. Therefore, increased levels of HH signalling seem to be both sufficient to initiate cancer formation and required for tumour survival. Recent studies have also shown that activation of HH signalling is required for survival of other tumours, including pancreatic adenocarcinomas and small-cell lung carcinomas (SCLCs). Screens for HH signalling inhibitors have led to the identification of reagents that block signal transduction at different levels within the pathway (TABLE 1), and several diverse antagonists of HH signalling are available that could lead to new treatment approaches for tumours that are difficult to treat by conventional means. Increasing our understanding of the cell-specific mechanisms that control HH signalling could provide clues to unravel the relationship between regulated proliferation and uncontrolled neoplasia in adult stem cells.

HH signalling pathway components

The Hh signalling pathway was first identified in a large *Drosophila* screen for genes that were required for patterning of the early embryo¹. Analysis of the *hedgehog* mutant, named after its prominent phenotype — epidermal spikes in larval segments that normally are devoid of these extensions — led to the cloning of the *hh* gene. Subsequent studies showed that three members of this family are present in mammals. These include Sonic (*Shh*), Desert (*Dhh*) and Indian (*Ihh*), all of which encode secreted proteins². Hh ligands undergo post-translational modifications, including autocatalytic cleavage and coupling of cholesterol to the amino-terminal peptide, which is the fragment that possesses all of the signalling activity (detailed information about Hh processing is described in REF.2).

Interestingly, Hh signalling is mediated via a series of inhibitory steps (FIG. 1). After secretion, the diffusion of all three Hh ligands is limited by binding to the Hip1, Patched1 (*Ptch1*) and Patched2 (*Ptch2*) transmembrane receptors, all of which are expressed on Hh responsive cells³⁻⁸. Although the exact details of ligand-receptor signalling are still under debate, the current model proposes that in the absence of ligands, Ptch receptors block the function of another transmembrane protein, Smoothened (*Smo*), and that this inhibition is relieved following ligand binding⁹. As a consequence, Smo becomes active and initiates a signalling cascade that

Summary

- Hedgehog (HH) signalling is required for cell differentiation and organ formation during embryogenesis. In the adult, HH signalling remains active in some organs where it has been implicated in the regulation of stem-cell maintenance and proliferation.
- HH signalling targets include genes that are important for cell proliferation — proto-oncogenes — as well as growth factors.
- Misregulation of HH signalling has been shown to cause formation of basal-cell carcinoma and medulloblastoma, and mutations of HH pathway components have been found both in familial and sporadic cases. More recently, small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) and pancreatic adenocarcinoma have been linked to HH signalling, providing a molecular mechanism for these aggressive diseases.
- Importantly, HH signalling seems to be required not only for cancer initiation but also for tumour growth and survival of medulloblastomas, SCLC and pancreatic adenocarcinoma.
- HH inhibitors could provide novel therapeutic approaches for treatment of otherwise hard to cure cancer types. Synthetic compounds have been identified that act as HH inhibitors in a very specific manner.

Therefore, ligand-induced activation creates a negative feedback loop that restricts the extent of Hh signalling. As a consequence, Hh signalling is regulated at different levels by components of the pathway — a peculiar phenomenon that indicates that tight control of its activity is crucial for proper function.

Natural Hh functions

Why is tight control of Hh signalling so important? One reason is that Hh signalling regulates cell differentiation and organ formation in a concentration-dependent manner — properties that have been well studied during embryonic development<sup>12</sup>. For example, during neural-tube formation, Shh is expressed in the ventral floorplate and directs the development of specific types of neurons in a dose-dependent fashion<sup>13–16</sup>. Ectopically increasing the activity of this pathway results in the development of ventral, rather than dorsal, types of neurons. This indicates that precise control of Hh activity is essential in regulating the appropriate localization and number of distinct populations of neurons.

Within the developing intestinal tract, sharp borders of Hh activity control patterning of organs in the fore-midgut region<sup>17</sup>. Shh is expressed throughout the epithelial layer of the developing digestive tract, but expression is excluded from the area that gives rise to the pancreas<sup>18,19</sup>. Ectopic activation of Hh signalling within the pancreatic epithelium blocks normal pancreas development and results in transdifferentiation of the pancreatic mesenchyme into the duodenal mesoderm<sup>18,19</sup>. Interestingly, low-level Hh signalling seems to be required for pancreas organogenesis and function, as Ihh, Dhh, Smo, Ptch1 and Hip1 are expressed within pancreatic epithelium, where they regulate insulin transcription and secretion in cultured insulinoma cells<sup>20–23</sup>. So, distinct tissues require specific levels of Hh signalling for proper function, and an increase or decrease of pathway activity results in severe defects.

results in the activation of Gli transcription factors — the vertebrate homologous of the *Drosophila* Cubitus interruptus, or Ci (reviewed in REF. 10).

Three vertebrate *Gli* genes — *Gli1*, *Gli2* and *Gli3* — have been identified. They possess context-dependent, distinct repressor and activator functions. Gli proteins are post-translationally modified, and cleavage of the whole proteins results in N-terminal-truncated activator and C-terminal-truncated repressor fragments. The details of Gli activation remain obscure. However, evidence indicates that in the absence of ligands, Gli proteins are linked to the cytoskeleton by interaction with a multiprotein complex that includes Fused (Fu) and Suppressor of fused (SuFu)<sup>11</sup>. Following ligand binding, Gli proteins translocate into the nucleus where they control transcription of target genes. It is important to note that several inhibitors of the pathway, including Ptc and Hip1, are transcriptional target genes.

Figure 1 | Hedgehog signalling pathway. In the absence of ligand, the Hh signalling pathway is inactive (left). In this case, the transmembrane protein receptor Patched (Ptc) inhibits the activity of Smoothened (Smo), a seven transmembrane protein. The transcription factor Gli, a downstream component of Hh signalling, is prevented from entering the nucleus through interactions with cytoplasmic proteins, including Fused and Suppressor of fused (Sufu). As a consequence, transcriptional activation of Hh target genes is repressed. Activation of the pathway (right) is initiated through binding of any of the three mammalian ligands — Sonic hedgehog, Desert hedgehog or Indian hedgehog (all are represented as Hh in the figure) — to Ptc. Ligand binding results in de-repression of Smo, thereby activating a cascade that leads to the translocation of the active form of the transcription factor Gli to the nucleus. Nuclear Gli activates target gene expression, including *Ptc* and *Gli* itself, as well as *Hip*, a Hh binding protein that attenuates ligand diffusion. Other target genes that are important for the oncogenic function of the Hh pathway are genes that are involved in controlling cell proliferation (cyclin D, cyclin E, *Myc* and components of the epidermal-growth-factor pathway) and in angiogenesis (components of the platelet-derived growth-factor and vascular-epithelial-growth-factor pathway).

nuclear localization of cyclin B by disruption of the physical interaction between Ptc and cyclin B. Finally, Shh blocks cell-cycle arrest that is mediated by p21 — an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases²⁷. These studies provide compelling evidence that increased cell proliferation, a hallmark of tumour formation, is mediated via direct interaction of the Hh pathway with components of the cell-cycle machinery.

Hh and cancer

**Pathway components that cause cancer.** If constitutive activation of Hh signalling induces tumorigenesis, it can be predicted that a subset of Hh-responsive cancers should possess activating mutations in components of the pathway (FIG. 2). In support of this hypothesis, mutations in *Shh* have been identified in a small percentage of basal-cell carcinoma (BCC), medulloblastoma and also in one case of breast carcinoma cells²⁸. The role of *Shh* as a dominant oncogene has further been shown in studies of mice and humans, in which ectopic expression of *Shh* results in BCC²⁸,²⁹. Similarly, constitutively active mutations of *SMO* have been found in 10–20% of BCCs, and the transcription factor *GLI1* was originally identified as a gene that was amplified in human glioma³⁰ — a central nervous system (CNS) tumour that is thought to be derived from glial cells (reviewed in REF. 31). Ectopic expression of *Gli1* or *Gli2* in the skin of *Xenopus* tadpoles or mice results in tumour formation, demonstrating that the most downstream components of the pathway are sufficient to initiate tumour growth³²⁻³⁴.

In addition, loss-of-function mutations in negative regulators of the pathway, including *PTCH1* and *SUFU*, have been associated with tumorigenesis, indicating that inhibitors of Hh signalling act as tumour suppressors. Mutations in *SUFU* have been associated with an increased risk of medulloblastoma in humans³⁵, whereas mutations in *PTCH1* are found in patients with basal-cell nevus syndrome³⁶,³⁷ (*BCNS*, also known as Gorlin’s syndrome). This syndrome is characterized by a high incidence of BCCs and medulloblastomas. It is important to note that *Ptch1*⁻/⁻ mice phenocopy many of the features that are associated with BCNS, including the high frequency of tumour development³⁸. So, a distinct subset of tumours in mice and human is characterized by mutations in Hh signalling components. More importantly, the observation that misregulation of Hh signalling occurs in familial cancer indicates that deregulation is sufficient to cause tumour formation. Moreover, sporadic BCCs and medulloblastomas are often characterized by inactivation of *PTCH1* or constitutive activation of *SMO*³⁹⁻⁴². Nonetheless, mutations of Hh signalling components have only been identified in a subset of sporadic BCCs and medulloblastomas. Future studies will address whether mutations in other Hh-pathway genes and/or mutations in signalling pathways that are unrelated to Hh cause formation of tumours that are marked by activated Hh signalling.

Cell-cycle regulation by Hh signalling

Whereas the requirements of Hh signalling during embryogenesis have been studied in great detail², less attention has been paid to the role of the pathway in adult tissues. Accumulating evidence indicates that Hh activity remains in a subset of cells in mature organs, and deregulated activity within these cells has been implicated in tumour formation (reviewed in REF. 10). One explanation for the role of Hh in tumorigenesis comes from recent studies in which it was shown that, in addition to controlling cell differentiation and tissue patterning, Hh signalling also regulates the proliferation of distinct cell types via direct activation of genes that are involved in the progression of the cell cycle. In particular, cyclin D and cyclin E — proteins that are involved in the G1–S transition — are known transcriptional targets of Ci in *Drosophila* cells²⁴, and Hh-dependent regulation of cyclin D1 and cyclin D2 has been confirmed in mammalian cells²⁵.

Further evidence for direct activation of the cell cycle by Hh signalling comes from studies in which it was shown that Ptc regulates the activity of cyclin B — a part of the mitosis-promoting-factor (MPF) complex²⁶. MPF activation is required for G2–M transition in all cell types. However, interaction with Ptc in the cytoplasm blocks cell proliferation by preventing nuclear localization of the activated complex. Ligand-induced activation of the pathway leads to

active during lung organogenesis, Hh signalling is normally downregulated in the mature organ, and only few Hh-responsive cells remain. However, adult tissue retains the capacity to respond to Hh signals, as Shh and Ptc expression are upregulated in regenerating tissue following chemically induced lung injury. Interestingly, HH expression is also increased in a subset of SCLC. Cancer cell lines that are derived from human tumours express SHH, as well as GLI1, indicating that an autocrine mechanism is maintaining active HH signalling within these cells. More importantly, inhibition of HH signalling via treatment with cyclopamine—a naturally occurring cholesterol analogue that inhibits SMO and functions through interaction with the HEPTAHELICAL BUNDLE—arrests the cell cycle at G0-G1 and induces apoptosis in SCLC.

In a manner that is similar to that seen in the lung, Hh signalling is active during pancreas organogenesis and low-level expression of Hip1, Ptc1, Smo, Ihh and Dhh has been detected within mature islets and cultured β-cell lines. Studies in transgenic mice that carry the bacterial lacZ gene under control of the Ptc1 promoter show that low-level β-galactosidase activity is also found in pancreatic-duct cells, the cell type that is believed to be responsible for adenocarcinoma growth. Whereas the expression level of PTC1 is below the threshold that can be detected by immunohistochemistry in human pancreatic samples, Hh signalling also seems to be involved in pancreatic cancer progression, as expression of signalling components is progressively increased in pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) and pancreatic adenocarcinomas. Moreover, ectopic expression of Shh under control of the pancreatic and duodenal homeobox gene 1 (Pdx1) promoter in transgenic mice results in formation of PanIN-1 and PanIN-2 lesions. PanIN-1 lesions are characterized by loss of cuboidal morphology of pancreatic-duct cells, mucin accumulation and papillary growth; nuclear abnormalities, including enlargement and some loss of polarity occur in PanIN-2 lesions.

Notably, the histological progression of pancreatic neoplasia in these Pdx1-Shh transgenic mice is accompanied by the induction of Erbb2 (also known as Her2/neu) expression, and mutations of the proto-oncogene KRas that have previously been associated with pancreatic adenocarcinomas. However, Pdx1-Shh transgenic mice die at around three weeks of age, and therefore cannot be used to test whether prolonged Hh upregulation results in metastatic cancer. Further experiments involving the transient activation of Hh signalling in adult pancreas are required to clearly establish that increased levels of this protein are sufficient to cause pancreatic adenocarcinoma formation.

Recent evidence also indicates that deregulated Hh signalling not only causes tumour formation, but is also required for tumour maintenance, as transformed cells continue to depend on Hh activity for survival and growth. Analysis of 26 human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines showed that all lines express HH target genes, and that treatment with cyclopamine induced

Ptc mutations that are associated with basal-cell carcinoma (BCC), as well as with medulloblastoma and rhabdomyosarcoma. Cancer-associated mutations are usually loss-of-function alleles, so Ptc can be considered to be a tumour suppressor. Similarly, loss-of-function mutations in Suppressor of fused (Sufu) have also been identified in some medulloblastoma cells. Constitutively active forms of Smo are oncogenic and can function independently of ligand binding to Ptc, leading to BCC. An oncogenic form of Shh has been associated with BCC, whereas ectopic expression of Gli has been shown to cause glioma. Gli is inhibited by protein kinase A (Pka). Misregulation of Hh signalling has also been associated with pancreatic adenocarcinoma, oesophageal and stomach cancer, and small-cell lung cancer. Little is known about the molecular mechanisms by which Hh signalling is upregulated in these tumours.

Specificity of Hh-induced tumour types. Until recently, increased Hh signalling had been linked to only a small subset of tumours in the brain, skin and muscle (FIG. 2; TABLE 2). Several recent studies indicate that elevation of the pathway causes cancers in other organs, including the lungs, gastrointestinal tract and pancreas. These findings are particularly important, as both SCLC and pancreatic adenocarcinoma are highly aggressive tumours with poor prognosis. Although

Box 1 | Hedgehog inhibitors

The Hedgehog (Hh) pathway can be blocked at different levels, and Hh inhibitors could serve as attractive anticancer agents because of their specific effects on a small number of cells in adult tissues. Several Hh-specific antagonists have therefore been identified and tested. Inhibition of ligand activity has been reported with antibodies (Ab) directed against Sonic Hedgehog (Shh)<sup>15</sup> (see a), and similar strategies might be considered for treating tumours that are shown to require continuous ligand activity for survival<sup>43</sup>. Several specific Smoothened (Smo) inhibitors have been identified (see b). Cyclopamine, a natural alkaloid derivative that is isolated from a plant of the lily family *Veratum californicum*, represents the first member of a class of small chemical compounds that specifically inhibit the Hh pathway<sup>70–72</sup>. It is a potent teratogen that specifically inhibits Smo activity by binding to its heptahelical bundle<sup>47</sup>. Treatment of mice that carry Hh-dependent tumours with cyclopamine results in growth inhibition and regression of cancerous tissue, but does not affect the health of treated animals. So, Hh inhibition causes little, if any, toxic effects on cells that do not depend on Hh signalling<sup>44,54</sup>.

Cyclopamine, however, is difficult to synthesize in large quantities and therefore is not applicable as a therapeutic agent — a factor that might also apply to a modified and more effective version of this compound, KAAD-cyclopamine<sup>73</sup>. Two large-scale screens for small-molecule inhibitors have identified several compounds that bind to Smo, including several that potently block a constitutively activated form of Smo that is known to cause BCs (SANT1-4, Cur61414)<sup>74,75</sup>. In addition, two additional compounds were isolated that seem to inhibit the pathway downstream of Smo. Although these reagents have not been characterized in detail, these results are encouraging, as they indicate that Hh signalling can be blocked with small compounds at different levels within the pathway. This is particularly important as mutations in proteins that lie downstream of Smo can be tumorigenic<sup>35</sup>.

Other compounds that block Gli activity could be used to treat a wide variety of Hh-dependent tumours. Protein kinase A (Pka) maintains the Gli transcription factors in an inactive state, so activation of Pka with agonists such as forskolin would prevent Gli-mediated activation of target-gene transcription. Gli can also be inhibited at the RNA level by targeting its transcripts with antisense oligonucleotides — an approach that has been used successfully in *Xenopus*. These and other related compounds might provide a novel way of treating Hh-responsive tumours.

apoptosis and loss of proliferation in 50% of the lines tested<sup>44</sup>. The observation that only half of the cell lines responded to cyclopamine treatment could indicate that the non-responsive lines have developed activating mutations in components downstream of SMO — a hypothesis that is supported by previous studies in which only a subset of glioma cell lines were noted to be responsive to cyclopamine-mediated inhibition of HH signalling<sup>50</sup>. Interestingly, most pancreatic cancer cell lines that were tested were positive for SHH expression by reverse transcription-PCR, indicating that tumour formation and growth might be elicited by an autocrine mechanism<sup>51</sup>. Similarly, other tumours that are derived from the digestive tract (oesophagus, stomach, biliary tract, but not colon) are also marked by increased levels of HH pathway activity and increased levels of SHH ligand and expression. As expected, cell lines that are derived from these gastrointestinal tumours are also susceptible to cyclopamine-mediated growth inhibition<sup>51</sup>.

It is interesting to note that Hh signalling remains active in some pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines that were originally isolated from liver metastases of primary pancreatic tumours, and that were subsequently re-derived during several rounds of injection into nude mice. More importantly, metastatic cells remain susceptible to cyclopamine treatment, both in cell culture and after xenotransplantation into nude mice<sup>44</sup>. Although it is unknown at present if increased Hh signalling facilitates tumour metastasis, these findings are exciting, as inhibition of the pathway could present novel avenues for therapy of primary and metastatic tumours (BOX 1). This is particularly important as the high frequency of metastasis in pancreatic adenocarcinomas during early stages of the disease, often before diagnosis, is one of the complications that contribute to low survival rates<sup>46</sup>.

Only a few familial cases of pancreatic adenocarcinomas have been described so far, and the involvement of HH signalling in these cases not been addressed. One family (family X) has been identified in which pancreatic adenocarcinomas occur with a very high frequency. The genomic location of the syndrome has recently been mapped to the chromosomal region 4q32-34 (REF. 52). Interestingly, *HIP1*, which encodes an
inhibitor of HH signalling, is located immediately adjacent to this region, raising the possibility that a hypomorphic mutation in *HIP1* could activate Hh signalling in pancreatic tissue. Although further studies are required to address this hypothesis, it is important to note that *HIP1* expression is lost in most human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines⁴⁴. In addition, *Hip1⁻/⁻* mice have increased levels of Hh signalling during pancreas development²³. Most *Hip1⁻/⁻* mice, however, die shortly after birth⁵³, and no pancreatic lesions have been found in *Hip1⁻/⁻* mice that survive to adulthood. Sequence analysis of the *HIP1* gene in DNA samples from members of family X might therefore be required to determine whether mutations in HH inhibitors are associated with familial forms of pancreatic adenocarcinomas.

### Target genes and interactions

Recent studies mark Hh signalling as a key contributor to cancer formation and maintenance in a distinct but restricted set of cell types⁴³,⁴⁴,⁵⁴. Improving our understanding of the mechanism that regulates Hh signalling and that of its target genes could lead to new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. As mentioned above, Hh signalling controls cell-cycle progression by regulating cyclin expression and activity. Moreover, Hh signalling regulates the expression of the oncogene n-Myc in the nervous system⁵⁵ and could regulate Myc expression in other tissues. Myc transcription factors are important inducers of cell proliferation, and cycloamine treatment of a medulloblastoma cell line decreases expression of c-Myc, l-Myc, and n-Myc genes⁵⁴. Therefore, constitutive activation of Hh signalling could maintain the proliferative state of cells through deregulated control of the cell cycle.

Other transcriptional targets of Hh signalling are of particular interest, as they are also genes that have been found to be upregulated during tumorigenesis. In *Drosophila*, Hh signalling promotes epidermal growth factor (Egf) signalling by inducing its expression, along with expression of Egf receptors⁵⁶. Interestingly, the activation of the Egf-receptor pathway is considered to be an early event in pancreas tumorigenesis. Autocrine signalling of the Egf pathway becomes activated during early stages of adenocarcinoma formation, and sustained expression of the Egf ligand Tgf-α in *Trp53*-mutant mice results in adenocarcinoma formation⁴⁹,⁵⁷,⁵⁸.

The Ras–Erk (extracellular-signal-regulated kinase) pathway, which is associated with cell proliferation, is activated by platelet-derived growth factor (Pdgf) signalling⁵⁹,⁶⁰. The Pdgf receptor-α (*Pdgfr-α*) is expressed at high levels in human and murine BCC⁶¹. The interaction between Hh and Pdgf signalling has been shown in cultured murine fibroblasts, BCC cells and CNS tumours⁵⁰. In these cells, ectopic expression of *Gli1* increases *Pdgfr-α* expression, whereas inhibition of the Hh pathway reduces *Pdgfr-α* levels⁶¹. Therefore, Hh signalling controls many important pathways that have been associated with tumorigenesis.

Although we have learned much about the downstream target genes of Hh signalling, few studies have addressed the upstream regulation of Hh signalling during cancer formation. A recent study presents intriguing evidence that Notch signalling — another pathway that is known to regulate cell differentiation and proliferation — regulates *Gli2* expression in mouse skin⁶². Inactivation of the *Notch1* gene in epidermis induces sustained expression of *Gli2* and causes formation of BCC-like tumours. By contrast, recent evidence indicates that Notch pathway activation is involved in pancreatic cancer formation⁶³, although an interaction between Notch and Hh signalling has not been described in this tissue. In the skin, Notch-dependent transformation is associated with the activation of β-catenin and Lef1 — two markers of active Wnt signalling. Upregulation of *WNT* expression has previously been observed in human BCCs⁶⁴, indicating that tumour progression is mediated via interaction of distinct signalling pathways that regulate organ development during embryogenesis. Further studies will be required to determine if these interactions might open new avenues for treatment of Hh-responsive tumours⁶⁴.

### Future directions

#### Adult stem cells, Hh signalling and cancer

One of the most important unresolved questions in cancer biology concerns the identity of cells that become tumorigenic. Striking similarities between cancer and stem cells have been previously reported, as both cell types have the potential for unlimited self-renewal. Hh signalling is active in and required to maintain stem-cell or precursor populations in several organs, and deregulation is known to result in tumorigenesis (BOX 2). Increasing evidence also indicates that, at least in some organs, uncontrolled Hh signalling results in unregulated self-renewal of progenitor cells. In skin, Hh signalling is required for hair morphogenesis during embryonic development. In the mature tissue, the multipotent skin and hair stem cells transiently express *Ptch* during the proliferation phase⁶⁵. Multipotent cells then give rise to two progenitor populations — epithelial progenitors (which do not express *Ptch* and give rise to the stratified epithelium) and hair progenitors (which continue to express *Ptch* while they proliferate and then differentiate into the different cell populations of the hair follicle). The level of Hh signalling, which is mainly mediated by Gli2 (REF. 25), seems to be crucial — loss of Hh signalling prevents proliferation, whereas increased Hh signalling results in formation of BCCs (BOX 2).

Within the adult lung, *Hh* expression is limited to small patches of epithelial cells⁴³. Expression becomes transiently activated during acute airway epithelial regeneration after tissue injury, indicating that the pathway might mark neuroendocrine progenitor cells within the lung epithelium. SCLCs possess many primitive neuroendocrine features, and some SCLCs require Hh signalling for tumour maintenance. The similarities between Hh signalling during neuroendocrine-cell regeneration and
Box 2 | Hh signalling, stem cells and cancer

Hedgehog (Hh) signalling is important for the maintenance of the hair follicle. The hair-follicle stem cells or multipotent progenitors (MPs, light yellow) give rise to both epithelium progenitors (EPs, orange) and to hair-follicle progenitors (HPs, red). The EPs proliferate and subsequently differentiate into stratified epithelium, whereas the HPs give rise to the hair follicle (dark yellow). The MPs express *Ptch* (which indicates that they are responding to Hh signalling) transiently when they proliferate at the beginning of each hair-follicle cycle. The HPs express *Ptch* when they proliferate, but *Ptch* becomes downregulated once they undergo differentiation. The expression pattern of *Ptch* is consistent with a role of Hh signalling in maintaining the stem-cell/progenitor-cell compartment. Basal-cell carcinomas of the skin are thought to derive from the hair follicle — in particular from the HP cells. Failure to downregulate Hh activity at the appropriate time could start the series of events that will lead to cancer. The cells that express *Ptch* are outlined in blue. A dashed blue outline indicates transient expression of *Ptch*.

In the pancreas, *Ptch* expression is found in duct and islet cells (red). Although still controversial, evidence indicates that ducts harbour progenitor cells (yellow — pancreatic stem cells that can give rise to the other pancreatic cell types, such as exocrine and endocrine cells). So far, it is not known whether all duct cells have the potential to differentiate into other lineages (islets and EXOCRINE ACINI), or whether a distinct set of a few multipotent progenitor cells are located within ducts. Pancreatic adenocarcinomas (purple) are believed to derive from duct cells and activation of Hh signalling is observed in human adenocarcinomas<sup>44</sup>. Transgenic mice that overexpress *Shh* in the pancreas show precancerous lesions, and continued activity of the Hh pathway is required for proliferation and survival of the cancer cells once the tumour has formed.

SC LC formation indicate that deregulation of the pathway in epithelial precursors is involved in tumour formation. Similarly, the duct structures that are believed to harbour adult pancreatic progenitor cells express *Ptch1* (REF. 20). Although conclusive evidence is lacking, cells within or attached to pancreatic ducts are thought to give rise to endocrine and exocrine cells during regeneration<sup>66</sup>, and endocrine cells that are located in epithelial structures known as islets of Langerhans continue to express *Ptch1*. Although the issue is still controversial, pancreatic adenocarcinomas are thought to arise from duct cells<sup>67,68</sup>, indicating that *Hh* expression could mark pancreatic progenitor cells and control their proliferative potential.

EXOCRINE ACIN

Alveolar structures that are formed by the cells that produce and release pancreatic digestive enzymes in the lumen of collecting pancreatic ducts.

Identification of these cells would be important for both generating more differentiated β-cells to treat diabetes, as well as to better understand the molecular and cellular principles that result in adenocarcinoma formation.

HH signalling is essential for numerous processes during organ development and maintenance of organ function. However, its ability to regulate cell differentiation and renewal in a dose-dependent manner also means that deregulation of this pathway can result in uncontrolled cell proliferation. Fortunately, specific inhibitors of the pathway are available for basic research, and those with therapeutic potential are being developed. However, it should be noted that

detailed molecular analysis of tumour types is required
to determine which patients will respond to anti-HH
therapy. Although all tested pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines seem to express HH signalling components, only five out of ten SCLC tumours express both SHH and GLI1 (REF. 43). So, analysis of tumour gene-expression profiles<sup>69</sup> might be useful in determining which tumour types have activated HH signalling and therefore be useful in predicting the outcome of potential treatments with HH inhibitors.

Discovering the dual role of this pathway — on one hand its requirement for normal organ development

and function, and on the other hand its association with tumorigenesis — has proven that the study of signalling pathways in the developing embryo can lead to important insights into disease progression and treatment. In the case of Hh signalling, this knowledge could lead to new therapeutic approaches to treat tumours that have poor prognoses. Finally, Hh signalling interacts with other embryonic signalling pathways that are known to be involved in cancer formation. Analysis of these connections should provide important insights into the molecular causes of cancer formation and growth.
