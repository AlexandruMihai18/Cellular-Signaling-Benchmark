Butirosin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic consisting two epimers at C-3′ of ribostamycin/xylostasin with a unique 4-amino-2-hydroxybutyrate moiety at C-1 of the aminocyclitol 2-deoxy-streptamine (2DOS). To date, most of the enzymes encoded in the biosynthetic gene cluster for butirosin, from the producing strain *Bacillus circulans*, have been characterized. A few unknown functional proteins, including nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide cofactor-dependent dehydrogenase/reductase (BtrE and BtrF), are supposed to be involved in the epimerization at C-3′ of butirosin B/ribostamycin but remain to be characterized. Herein, the conversion of ribostamycin to xylostasin by BtrE and BtrF in the presence of NAD⁺ and NADPH was demonstrated. BtrE oxidized the C-3′ of ribostamycin with NAD⁺ to yield 3′-oxoribostamycin. BtrF then reduced the generated 3′-oxoribostamycin with NADPH to produce xylostasin. This reaction step was the last piece of butirosin biosynthesis to be described.

## Introduction

Butirosin belongs to a family of 2-deoxystreptamine (2DOS)-containing aminoglycoside antibiotics with a characteristic (S)-4-amino-2-hydroxybutyrate at the C-1 of 2DOS (Scheme 1).[1]

**Scheme 1. Chemical structure of butirosin and related compounds.**

Until now, the biosynthetic pathway for butirosin B (3) has been established mostly in vitro (Scheme 2).[2] First, glucose 6-phosphate (G6P) is converted to 2-deoxy-scyllo-inosose (2DOI) by a 2DOI synthase, BtrC.[3] Then, 2DOI is transaminated to 2-deoxy-scyllo-inosamine (2DOIA) by a PLP-dependent aminotransferase, BtrS.[4] The C-1 hydroxy group of 2DOIA is oxidized by a radical SAM dehydrogenase, BtrN, to yield 3-amino-2,3-dideoxy-scyllo-inosose (amino-2DOI),[5] which is then transaminated to 2DOS, again by BtrS.[4c] It should be noted that only the butirosin biosynthetic pathway uses this type of radical SAM dehydrogenase to oxidize 2DOIA. 2DOS is next glycosylated with UDP-GlcNAc by a glycosyltransferase, BtrM, to produce *N*-acetylparomamine, which is deacetylated by a deacetylase, BtrD, to afford paromamine.[6] Although the activity of BtrM has yet to be confirmed in vitro, its homologue NeoM in neomycin biosynthesis has been functionally characterized.[7] The C-6′ position of paromamine is oxidized by an FAD-dependent dehydrogenase, BtrQ, followed by transamination with a PLP-dependent aminotransferase, BtrB, to give neamine.[8] Neamine is next ribosylated with 5-phosphoribose 1-diphosphate (PRPP) by a phosphoribosyltransferase, BtrL, and then a phosphatase, BtrP, leading to ribostamycin (1),[9] which is further decorated with (S)-4-amino-2-hydroxybutyrate (AHBA) by the pathway-specific enzymes.[10] AHBA is supplied through the activation of the γ-carboxylate of L-glutamate by an ATP-grasp enzyme, BtrJ, and transferred to an acyl carrier protein, Btrl, to yield γ-L-glutamyl-ACP, which is then decarboxylated to 4-aminobutyryl-ACP by a PLP-dependent decarboxylase, BtrK.[10a] The resulting generated 4-aminobutyryl-ACP is then further aminoacylated with L-glutamate by BtrJ to prevent intramolecular five-membered lactam formation. The α-position of dipeptide-ACP thioester is selectively oxidized by an FMN-dependent monooxygenase, BtrO, coupled with an NADH-FMN oxidoreductase, BtrU, to produce γ-L-glutamyl-AHBA-ACP. The γ-L-glutamyl-AHBA moiety is then transferred onto the C-1 hydroxy group of 1 by a characteristic dipeptidyl transferase, BtrH.[10b] Finally, the terminal γ-L-glutamyl moiety is removed by a γ-L-glutamyl cyclotransferase, BtrG, to afford butirosin B (3).

Butirosin is known to be a mixture of 3 and butirosin A (4), the latter being a C-3′ epimer of 3. In addition to 3, 4, and 1, xylostasin (2) has also been isolated from the butirosin producer.

er *Bacillus circulans*. [11] Conversion of 2 to 4 with a blocked mutant has also been reported. [12] Thus, it was speculated that the epimerization reaction at C-3" of 1 and 3 is involved in completing the biosynthesis. One candidate enzyme for this epimerization is a putative short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR), BtrF, which is not involved in the aforementioned butirosin B biosynthesis even though it is uniquely encoded in the butirosin biosynthetic gene cluster. Additionally, another uncharacterized medium-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (MDR), BtrE, appears to be involved in this epimerization reaction, while its homologous dehydrogenase, such as NeoE in neomycin biosynthesis, is involved in the oxidation reaction of 2-deoxy-scyllo-inosamine (2DOIA) in 2DOS biosynthesis. [13] Because BtrE lacks a characteristic zinc-binding motif, but possesses a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) cofactor binding motif, the another redox activity other than 2DOIA oxidation has been speculated. A combination of these redox enzymes can be used for epimerization with regio- and stereoselective reduction of presumed ketone intermediates generated by oxidation of the C-2" or C-3" position of 1 and 3 (Scheme 3). In the case of oxidation at C-2", the keto-enol tautomerization was supposed to be involved in the epimerization.

Herein, we report the roles of BtrE and BtrF in the biosynthesis of 2. BtrE is demonstrated to catalyze the C-3" oxidation of 1, and BtrF then catalyzes the reduction of C-3" of 3"-oxoribostamycin to yield 2. Although 3 could not be assayed in this study owing to a lack of availability, this work strongly suggests that BtrE and BtrF are also responsible for the conversion of 3 to 4.

oxidant, decrease in the amount of 2 and production of neamine were also observed (Figure S4). These results suggested that the epimerization of 1 to 2 was reversible using these two oxido-reductases. The preferences of the enzymes for cofactors were confirmed by analyzing their binding affinity to reduced NADs (Figure S5). BtrE and BtrF were mixed with NADH or NADPH and the free cofactors were removed by gel-filtration. The UV spectra of solutions of the enzyme–cofactor complex showed that the BtrE-NADH and BtrF-NADPH complexes were formed. Therefore, it was determined that BtrE used NAD⁺/NADH as a redox cofactor and that BtrF used NADP⁺/NADPH.

**Results**

**Epimerization of ribostamycin (1) by BtrE and BtrF**

The *btrE* and *btrF* genes were amplified by PCR with chromosomal DNA of *B. circulans* ATCC 21558 and expressed in *Escherichia coli* BL21(DE3) with the expression vector pColdI. Expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). Cells containing recombinant BtrE and BtrF were homogenized by sonication and purified by Ni-affinity chromatography (Figure S1 in the Supporting Information). Purified BtrE and BtrF were mixed with 1, NAD⁺/NADH, and NADP⁺/NADPH as the oxidant/reductants. The reaction products were treated with 2,4-dinitro-1-fluorobenzene (DNFB) to obtain 2,4-dinitrophenyl (DNP) derivatives of the aminoglycosides, which were analyzed by liquid chromatography coupled with a UV detector (350 nm) and ESI-MS (negative-mode). In the presence of NAD⁺, NADPH, BtrE, BtrF, and 1, the formation of 2 could be clearly detected by using HPLC (Figure 1A). Without either BtrE or BtrF, no formation of 2 was observed. Thus, it appeared that both BtrE and BtrF were required for the epimerization of 1 to yield 2. Optimal conditions for this epimerization were found to be under basic conditions at pH 9.5, rather than pH 8.6 (Figure S2). Adding EDTA to the reaction did not affect the epimerization reaction; this suggests that there is no requirement for divalent metal cations (Figure S3). Additionally, NAD⁺ and NADPH were found to be appropriate redox reagents for this epimerization, because 2 was not formed in the absence of these cofactors (Figure 1 D, E). When 1 was reacted with only BtrE in the presence of NAD⁺, a decrease in the amount of 1 and production of neamine were observed (Figure 1C); BtrF alone did not react with 1. These results indicated that BtrE oxidized 1 to yield 3′-oxoribostamycin, which then decomposed to neamine by β-elimination. Attempts to isolate the presumed oxoribostamycin failed. When 2 was reacted with BtrE and BtrF in the presence of NADH and NADP⁺, formation of 1 was detected (Figure S4). When BtrF was treated with 2 in the presence of NADP⁺ as an oxidant, decrease in the amount of 2 and production of neamine were also observed (Figure S4). These results suggested that the epimerization of 1 to 2 was reversible using these two oxido-reductases. The preferences of the enzymes for cofactors were confirmed by analyzing their binding affinity to reduced NADs (Figure S5). BtrE and BtrF were mixed with NADH or NADPH and the free cofactors were removed by gel-filtration. The UV spectra of solutions of the enzyme–cofactor complex showed that the BtrE-NADH and BtrF-NADPH complexes were formed. Therefore, it was determined that BtrE used NAD⁺/NADH as a redox cofactor and that BtrF used NADP⁺/NADPH.

Isolation of 2, formed from 1 by the action of BtrE and BtrF in the presence of NAD⁺ and NADPH, required the addition of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and pyruvate to allow for NAD⁺ regeneration [14] (consumed by BtrE oxidation) and addition of glucose dehydrogenase (GDH) and glucose to regenerate NADPH [14] (consumed by BtrF reduction). Consequently, most

The reaction mixtures contained 1 mm each 1, NAD⁺, and NADPH and 10 μM each BtrE and BtrF in buffer B (50 mM CHES-NaOH (pH 9.5), 10% glycerol, and 200 mM KCl). All reactions were conducted at 37°C for 6.3 h.

of 1 was consumed and transformed to 2, indicating that the epimerization equilibrium was in the forward reaction, producing 2 under these conditions (Figure S6). A series of NMR analyses clearly showed that the structure of product from the reaction of 1 with BtrE and BtrF was 2, which was established by comparison with reported NMR data of 2 (Figures S7–S12, Tables S1, S2).[15] This result also indicated that NADH inhibited the oxidation of 1 by BtrE and NADP⁺ inhibited the reduction of oxoribostamycin by BtrF. Because epimerization was largely affected by the concentrations of NAD⁺/NADH and NADP⁺/NADPH, this transformation might be coupled with other redox enzymatic reactions under physiological conditions.

### Stereochemistry of the epimerization by BtrE and BtrF

The regiospecificities of these reactions were determined using [1-²H]glucose as a hydrogen source for NADPH in the reduction of the presumed oxoribostamycin by BtrF coupled with the GDH glucose oxidation. Because two types of stereospecific NAD⁺/NADP⁺-dependent GDHs are known,[16] both types were used to determine the stereospecificity of pro-chirality of the two hydrogen atoms on NADPH. When GDH derived from *Thermoplasma acidophilum* (TA-GDH) was used (which produced (4R)-[²H]NADPH), the reaction of 1 with BtrE/BtrF produced unlabeled 2, as detected by LC-ESI-MS analysis (Figure 2B). Conversely, when GDH from *Bacillus* sp. (BS-GDH) was used (which produced (4S)-[²H]NADPH), a clear incorporation of deuterium into 2 was detected (Figure 2A). ¹H NMR of the obtained deuterium-labeled 2 showed significant reduction of ¹H atoms at the C-3″ position by comparison with other protons (Figure S13). ²H NMR and ¹³C NMR data also supported that deuterium was incorporated at the C-3″ position (Figures S13 and S14). These data clearly indicated that BtrF reduced 3″-oxoribostamycin with the pro-S hydrogen atom of NADPH to produce 2.

The regioselectivity of the oxidation catalyzed by BtrE with NAD⁺ was also determined by detecting the reverse reaction from 2. 2 was treated with chirally deuterium-labeled NADH as well as NADP⁺, BtrE, and BtrF to produce 1. When chirally deuterium-labeled NADH that was prepared from NAD⁺ with [1-²H]glucose by TA-GDH was used, deuterium incorporation was observed but not so when prepared using BS-GDH (Figure 2C, D). These data indicated that BtrE reduced 3″-oxoribostamycin with the pro-R hydrogen atom of NADH to give 1. When the BtrE/BtrF reaction with 1 was conducted in buffer prepared with deuterium oxide, no significant deuterium incorporation was observed in 2 by LC-ESI-MS (Figure 2E, F). This clearly indicated that the keto-enol tautomerization of 2″-oxoribostamycin could be ruled out during epimerization by BtrE and BtrF. Thus, it was clear that BtrE oxidized the C-3″ of 1 to afford 3″-oxoribostamycin, which was subsequently reduced by BtrF to yield 2.

### Substrate specificity of BtrE and BtrF

The substrate specificity of the BtrE/BtrF reaction was also investigated using some pentose-containing compounds and

2DOIA. Consequently, 4 was epimerized by BtrE and BtrF to afford 3 (Figures S16 and S17), but other substrates tested, including 2DOIA and neomycin, were not recognized (Table S3). The specific activity of BtrF toward 4 was 6.0 ± 0.0 units (one unit = 1 mmol of NADH formation per 1 mmol enzyme per minute), which was a comparable value to that for 2, at 6.6 ± 0.1 units (Table S4). Thus, it was found that BtrF recognized the 2 moiety for the reduction.

BtrE recognized only 1 among the tested substrates (Table S3). The specific activity of BtrE with 1 and NAD⁺ was 3.7 ± 0.2 units, which was a comparable value to that for BtrF with 2. Kinetic analysis of BtrE with 1 and NAD⁺ revealed that the $K_{\text{M}}$ value for 1 is 0.96 ± 0.12 mM, $K_{\text{M}}$ value for NAD⁺ is 0.99 ± 0.10 mM, and $k_{\text{cat}}$ values for these substrates are 0.40 ± 0.01 and 0.46 ± 0.03 s⁻¹, respectively, at 37°C.

### Discussion

In the present study, an NAD⁺-dependent dehydrogenase, BtrE, that oxidizes 1 was shown to produce 3″-oxoribostamycin, which was then reduced to 2 by an NADPH-dependent reductase, BtrF (Scheme 3, bottom and Figure 2). Further, 3 and 4 were found to be substrates in the BtrE/BtrF reaction. Thus, BtrE and BtrF appeared to recognize characteristic pseudo-trisaccharide structures of 1 and 2 in 3 and 4. Also, a BtrE homologue, NeoE (originally deposited as NeoA) involved in neomycin biosynthesis, was confirmed not to oxidize 1 (data not shown). Thus, the observed oxidation activity toward 1 appeared to be a characteristic feature for BtrE in butirosin biosynthesis. The different substrate specificities between BtrE and NeoE might have been caused by a zinc-binding motif for the NeoE-type of 2DOIA dehydrogenases, which was not conserved in BtrE. However, it was difficult to predict the substrate recognition mechanism and regio- and stereoselectivity of these oxidations from only sequence comparisons of these two enzymes.

Multiple-sequence alignment of BtrE homologues showed that BtrE possessed a conserved Asp/Glu residue among NAD⁺-dependent proteins at the C-terminal side of the second β-strand in the NAD(H) binding domain after the GxGxxG motif (Figure S18 A). This acidic residue is known to be involved in hydrogen-bond formation with two hydroxy groups at C-2 and C-3 of the adenosine ribose in NAD(H), which indicates that BtrE is an NAD(H)-specific enzyme rather than NADP(H)-specific.[17] Multiple-sequence alignment of BtrF homologues showed that they have a conserved GxNRGxG motif, in which a unique Arg residue is involved in the recognition of the 2′-phosphate group of NADPH (Figure S18 B).[18] Additionally, BtrF homologues do not possess a critical Asp residue for NAD(H)-dependent enzymes that interacts with the ribose moiety of NAD(H) (residues 30–40, Figure S18 C).[19] These sequence alignments agreed with the preference of NAD binding by BtrE and BtrF observed in our binding study (Figure S5).

The face selectivity of NAD(P)⁺ cofactors by BtrE and BtrF was the opposite of each other; BtrE was observed to be a pro-R (A) specific dehydrogenase and BtrF a pro-S (B) specific reductase. As the sequence analyses indicated that both BtrE

The reaction mixtures of E) and F) contained 1 mM 1, 1 mM NAD⁺, 1 mM NADPH, 1 mM d-glucose, 10 μM BtrE, 10 μM BtrF, 0.75 U per 100 μL LDH, and 0.05 U per 100 μL GDH. All reactions were conducted at 37°C for 3 h.
and BtrF had the Rossmann-fold motif for recognizing NAD(P)⁺, the binding mode of the cofactor was presumed to be similar to each other. Thus, this opposite-face cofactor selectivity could have been caused by differences in the binding location of the substrate 3′-oxoribostamycin. Structural analyses of BtrE and BtrF in substrate complexes would help to elucidate their recognition mechanisms of aminoglycosides and also their stereoselective redox reactions.

It was unclear why the present epimerization is involved in the late stage of aminoglycoside antibiotic biosynthesis, because the antibacterial activities of 1 and 2 and of 3 and 4 are known to be similar.[11,20] Because no obvious resistance gene is encoded within the butirosin biosynthetic gene cluster,[21] this epimerization might be required to modulate the biological activity of the antibiotics under physiological conditions. To maintain a BtrE enzyme that lacks 2DOIA-oxidation activity but possesses oxidation activity for 1, a unique radical SAM dehydrogenase, BtrN, appears to have been acquired to biosynthesize the aminoglycoside core structure in butirosin biosynthesis.

Sugar epimerases are recognized as important modification enzymes of carbohydrates in nature.[22] A keto–enol tautomerization mechanism is often utilized in epimerization at the α-position of carbonyl groups in sugars because the α-proton is acidic, and thus easily deprotonated, and re-protonation occurs from the opposite face of enol/enolate intermediates. Conversely, UDP-galactose-4-epimerase (UGE) utilizes oxidation–reduction chemistry to epimerize UDP-glucose (UDP-Glc) to UDP-galactose (UDP-Gal) with NAD⁺ as cofactor.[22] UGE catalyzes the oxidation at C-4 of UDP-Glc to generate transient UDP-4-keto-glucose, which is then reduced by the formed NADH to yield UDP-Gal. It should be noted that UGE catalyzes this epimerization as a single enzyme. Decaprenylphosphoryl-β-d-arabinofuranose (DPA) is formed through a two-step epimerization of decaprenylphosphoryl-β-d-ribose (DPR) in mycobacteria.[23] Because DPA is an important precursor at the branching point of the biosynthesis of arabinogalactan and lipoarabinomannan, major components of the cells walls of mycobacteria, these epimerization enzymes are recognized as antimicrobial targets.[24] An FAD-dependent oxidase, DprE1, is believed to catalyze the oxidation at C-2′ of DPR to give decaprenylphosphoryl-β-2′-keto-erythro-pentafuranose (DPX), which is then reduced by an NADH-dependent reductase, DprE2, to yield DPA.[23b] This two-step epimerization mechanism is similar to the epimerization of 1 catalyzed by BtrE and BtrF, except for their preference of redox cofactors. It is also noteworthy that DPR is formed from decaprenylphosphate and PRPP in a two-step reaction mechanism through the decaprenylphosphate-ribose-5-phosphate by the action of two enzymes.[25] This reaction sequence consisting of double two-step transformations, ribosylation and epimerization, is the same as the biosynthesis of 2 and 4. It is interesting to note that different enzymes are used to catalyze the same reaction in the biosynthesis of different natural products in different microorganisms. A radical SAM epimerase, NeoN, in neomycin biosynthesis has been recently reported to catalyze the epimerization at C-5″ of neomycin C to produce neomycin B, using

a radical reaction mechanism as a single enzyme.[26] The NeoN reaction seems quite specific to the biosynthesis of only this family of aminoglycoside antibiotics. However, BtrE-types of MDRs and BtrF-types of SDRs are found in the genome of various organisms. Thus, the present identification of a two-step epimerization of a sugar moiety by two NAD(P)⁺-dependent dehydrogenase/reductases may be widely distributed in various carbohydrate modification reactions. These present findings should thus aid in illuminating the functions of this family of oxidoreductases, which might be involved in such epimerization reactions.

### Conclusion

The full biosynthesis of 4 has finally been elucidated. It is remarkable that almost all of the enzymes (except for two ABC transporters BtrW/BtrX and two transcriptional regulators BtrR1/R2) encoded in the butirosin biosynthetic gene cluster were found to be used for the biosynthesis of 4. However, the functions of BtrA and BtrV, which are conserved among the biosynthetic gene clusters for ribostamycin-containing aminoglycosides, remain unknown. Thus, we speculate that BtrA and BtrV might be indirectly involved in the ribosylation event that is catalyzed by BtrL and BtrP; for instance, they might function as phosphate acceptors from phosphoribstamycin or 5′-phosphoribose-1-diphosphate (PRPP) formation. Overall, the epimerization of 1/2 and 3/4 characterized here is the last enzymatic reaction to be described in the complete biosynthesis of these unique antibiotics.

### Experimental Section

#### General: Restriction enzymes and ligase were purchased from Takara Bio, Inc. (Tokyo, Japan). Synthesis of oligonucleotides and DNA sequence analysis were performed by Fasmac Co., Ltd. (Atsugi, Japan). Extractions of DNA fragments were performed with Gene Clean II Kit (MP Biomedicals, LLC; Solon, OH, USA). Micro Refrigerated Centrifuge Model 3700 (Kubota Corporation; Tokyo, Japan) and HIMAC Centrifuge SCR20B (Hitachi Co., Ltd.; Tokyo, Japan) were used for centrifugation.

(Table S5), according to the QuickChange method (Stratagene). Amplified plasmid was extracted to confirm the DNA sequence, the resulting plasmid was digested with Ndel and HindIII, and the DNA fragment was ligated into a linearized pColdI vector. The recombinant BtrE and BtrF were expressed in BL21(DE3) cells. The cells were grown in lysogeny broth (LB) supplemented with ampicillin ($100 \mu\mathrm{g} \cdot \mathrm{mL}^{-1}$) at $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ under agitation (200 rpm). Expression was induced at mid-log phase ($A_{600}=0.6-1.0$) with IPTG (0.3 mM). The cells were then incubated overnight at $15^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ with agitation and collected by centrifugation ($6750 \times g$ at $4^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for 20 min.).

The cell paste was resuspended in a ten times its mass of buffer A ($50 \mathrm{~mm}$ Tris, pH 7.5, $10 \%$ glycerol (v/v), $200 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{KCl}$), and the cells were disrupted by sonication on ice. The resulting suspension was centrifuged ($9840 \times g$ at $4^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for 10 min) and the supernatant was loaded on a Ni-affinity column (COSMOGEL His-accept SF beads; Nakalai Tesque, Inc.; Kyoto, Japan). After washing with $30 \mathrm{~mL}$ of buffer A, the resin was washed with buffer A that contained imidazole ($20 \mathrm{~mm}$). The proteins were eluted with buffer A containing $500$ and $200 \mathrm{~mm}$ imidazole for BtrE and BtrF, respectively. The collected fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE ($12.5 \%$) and the desired fractions were desalted with PD-10 gel-filtration columns (GE Healthcare). The resulting collection of enzymes were concentrated by ultracentrifugation by using Amicon Ultra-4 10 K centrifugal filter devices (capacity $4 \mathrm{~mL}$; Millipore) and stored at $-80^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ until use. The concentration of the proteins were measured by using a NanoDrop Lite spectrophotometer in BSA mode (Thermo Fischer).

Analysis of the enzymatic reaction: The buffer for BtrE and BtrF was exchanged with buffer B ($50 \mathrm{~mm}$ CHES-NaOH, pH 9.5, $10 \%$ glycerol (v/v), and $200 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{KCl}$) by way of ultracentrifugation by using Amicon Ultra-4 10 K centrifugal filter devices (Millipore Corp.). 1 (final conc. = $1 \mathrm{~mm}$), NADPH ($1 \mathrm{~mm}$), BtrE ($10 \mu \mathrm{M}$), and BtrF ($10 \mu \mathrm{M}$) in buffer B (total volume = $100 \mu \mathrm{L}$). The solution was incubated at $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for $6.3 \mathrm{~h}$. The reaction was quenched with ethanol ($100 \mu \mathrm{L}$). An aliquot ($40 \mu \mathrm{L}$) of the resulting supernatant of the quenched mixture was mixed with DNFB ($40 \mu \mathrm{L}, 5 \%$ in methanol), DMSO ($20 \mu \mathrm{L}$), and $\mathrm{NaOH}(4 \mu \mathrm{L}, 2 \mathrm{M})$ and incubated at $60^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for $1 \mathrm{~h}$. $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(50 \mu \mathrm{L})$ and ethyl acetate ($500 \mu \mathrm{L}$) were added to the reaction mixture, and the resulting DNP derivatives were extracted. The supernatant ($450 \mu \mathrm{L}$) was evaporated and resuspended in methanol ($50 \mu \mathrm{L}$). An aliquot ($4 \mu \mathrm{L}$) of the solution was analyzed on an HPLC equipped with an L-4000 UV Detector and L-6250 Intelligent Pump (Hitachi) and using a Pegasil ODS SP100 column ($4.6 \times 250 \mathrm{~mm}$; Senshu Scientific Co., Ltd.; Tokyo, Japan). Elution was performed using a gradient of solvents A ($\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$) and B (methanol) for $0-20 \mathrm{~min}, 75-80 \% \mathrm{~B}$ linear gradient; for $20-21 \mathrm{~min}, 80-100 \% \mathrm{~B}$ linear gradient; for $21-30 \mathrm{~min} 100 \% \mathrm{~B}$; with a flow rate of $0.8 \mathrm{~mL} \cdot \mathrm{min}^{-1}$. The eluent was monitored at $\lambda=350 \mathrm{~nm}$ and LC-ESI-MS spectrometry (negative mode) was performed (LC-MS 2020, Shimadzu Corp.) using a TSK-gel ODS 100Z column ($3 \mu \mathrm{m}$ particle size, $2.0 \times 150 \mathrm{~mm}$; Tosoh; Tokyo, Japan) with a linear gradient of solvents A and B, as above, for $0-40 \mathrm{~min}, 75-80 \% \mathrm{~B}$ linear gradient; for $40-41 \mathrm{~min}, 80-100 \% \mathrm{~B}$ linear gradient; for $41-50 \mathrm{~min} 100 \% \mathrm{~B}$; with a flow rate of $0.1 \mathrm{~mL} \cdot \mathrm{min}^{-1}$.

Binding experiments with NADH and NADPH: BtrE ($0.90 \mathrm{~mm}$) or BtrF ($1.2 \mathrm{~mm}$) were incubated with either NADH ($2 \mathrm{~mm}$) or NADPH ($2 \mathrm{~mm}$) for $3 \mathrm{~h}$ at $4^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. The incubated solutions were then desalted with PD-10, and the UV/Vis spectra of the resulting protein solutions were measured. Solutions that were not incubated were prepared as controls. The concentrations of the desalted enzymes were: BtrE-NADH = $145 \mu \mathrm{M}$, BtrE-NADPH = $104 \mu \mathrm{M}$, BtrF-NADH = $139 \mu \mathrm{M}$, BtrF-NADPH = $86.6 \mu \mathrm{M}$.

Preference of pH: The influence of pH was assessed by preparing ten different reaction buffers [CHES ($50 \mathrm{~mm}$), glycerol ($10 \%, v / v$), $\mathrm{KCl}(200 \mathrm{~mm})]$ from pH 8.59 to 9.96 by adding $\mathrm{NaOH}(2 \mathrm{M})$. Compound 1 (final $1 \mathrm{~mm}$) was incubated with $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}(1 \mathrm{~mm}), \mathrm{NADPH}(1 \mathrm{~mm})$, BtrE ($50 \mu \mathrm{M}$), and BtrF ($50 \mu \mathrm{M}$, total vol. = $50 \mu \mathrm{L}$). All reactions were conducted at $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for $4 \mathrm{~h}$. After quenching with ethanol ($50 \mu \mathrm{L}$), DNP derivatization and HPLC analysis were conducted.

Isolating BtrE/BtrF reaction products from ribostamycin (1): 1 ($23.9 \mathrm{mg}$, final $1.8 \mathrm{~mm}$), $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}(28.4 \mathrm{mg}$, final $2 \mathrm{~mm}), \mathrm{NADPH}$ [prepared enzymatically with BS-GDH ($0.8 \mathrm{U} \cdot \mathrm{mL}^{-1}$), d-glucose ($4 \mathrm{~mm}$), and $\mathrm{NADP}^{+}(4 \mathrm{~mm}$, final conc. = $1.2 \mathrm{~mm}$], sodium pyruvate ($4.4 \mathrm{mg}$, final conc. = $2 \mathrm{~mm}$; Tokyo Chemical Industry Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan), and d-glucose ($7.2 \mathrm{mg}$, final conc. = $4 \mathrm{~mm}$; Kanto Chemical Co., Inc., Tokyo, Japan) were mixed with BtrE ($50 \mu \mathrm{M}$), BtrF ($50 \mu \mathrm{M}$), LDH ($45.9 \mathrm{U} \cdot \mathrm{mL}^{-1}$; Sigma-Aldrich), and GDH from *Bacillus* sp. (BS-GDH, $0.8 \mathrm{U} \cdot \mathrm{mL}^{-1}$, Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd., Osaka, Japan) in buffer B (total vol. = $20 \mathrm{~mL}$). The solution was divided into 20 tubes of $1 \mathrm{~mL}$ each, and the tubes were incubated at $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for $3 \mathrm{~h}$. The solutions were then combined and quenched with $20 \mathrm{~mL}$ of ethanol. After removal of the precipitate by centrifugation, the supernatant was loaded onto a Dowex AG1-X8 column ($\mathrm{OH}^{-}$ form, column diameter = $3 \mathrm{~cm}, 20 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$; Sigma-Aldrich). The filtrate was then loaded onto an Amberite CG50 column ($\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$ form, column diameter = $3 \mathrm{~cm}, 15 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$; Dow Chemical Co., Midland, MI, USA). After washing with water, aminoglycosides were eluted with aq $\mathrm{NH}_{3}(1 \mathrm{M})$. The resulting aminoglycoside-containing solution was loaded onto a Dowex AG1-X8 column ($\mathrm{SO}_{4}^{2-}$ form, column diameter = $1 \mathrm{~cm}, 10 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$) and the filtrate collected. After solvent removal, $8.8 \mathrm{mg}$ of the sulfate form of aminoglycoside was obtained and analyzed by NMR (DRX-500; Bruker Biospec, Erlangen, Germany).

Stereochemistry of the reduction catalyzed by BtrF: $(4S)-[2 \mathrm{H}] \mathrm{NADPH}$ was prepared by incubating BS-GDH ($0.8 \mathrm{U} \cdot \mathrm{mL}^{-1}$) with d-[1-$^{2} \mathrm{H}]$ glucose ($4 \mathrm{~mm}$; Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc., Tewksbury, MA, USA) and $\mathrm{NADP}^{+}(4 \mathrm{~mm})$ in buffer A ($400 \mu \mathrm{L}$) at $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for $2 \mathrm{~h}$. To prepare $(4R)-[2 \mathrm{H}] \mathrm{NADPH}$, TA-GDH ${ }^{[27]}(20 \mu \mathrm{M}$; prepared by using artificial genes, Eurofins Genomics, Ebersberg, Germany; see the Supporting Information) was incubated with d-[1-$^{2} \mathrm{H}]$ glucose ($4 \mathrm{~mm}$) and $\mathrm{NADP}^{+}(4 \mathrm{~mm})$ in buffer A (total $400 \mu \mathrm{L}$) at $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for $2 \mathrm{~h}$. The solutions containing deuterium-labeled NADPH were subject to ultracentrifugation in Amicon-Ultra-4 10 K centrifugal devices (Millipore) to remove GDHs and the pH was adjusted to 9.5 with $\mathrm{NaOH}(2 \mathrm{M})$. The concentrations of the deuterium-labeled NADPH that were generated were estimated to be $1.05 \mathrm{~mm}$ for $(4S)-[2 \mathrm{H}] \mathrm{NADPH}$ and $1.09 \mathrm{~mm}$ for $(4R)-[2 \mathrm{H}] \mathrm{NADPH}$, based on $A_{340}$ values for NADH ($\varepsilon_{\max }=6300 \mathrm{~m}^{-1} \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$).

Ribostamycin 1 ($1 \mathrm{~mm}), \mathrm{NAD}^{+}(1 \mathrm{~mm}), \mathrm{BtrE}(10 \mu \mathrm{M})$, and BtrF ($10 \mu \mathrm{M}$) were mixed with $(4S)-[2 \mathrm{H}] \mathrm{NADPH}$ or $(4R)-[2 \mathrm{H}] \mathrm{NADPH}(45 \mu \mathrm{L}$, final conc. $\approx 1 \mathrm{~mm}$), and the solution was adjusted to $50 \mu \mathrm{L}$ with buffer B. The solutions were incubated at $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for $3 \mathrm{~h}$, then the reaction was quenched with an equal volume of ethanol and treated with DNFB. Aliquots ($4 \mu \mathrm{L}$) of the resulting DNP-derivative solutions were analyzed by using LC-ESI-MS.

Isolating BtrE/BtrF reaction products from ribostamycin (1) with $^{2} \mathrm{H}$-labeled NADPH: A large amount of $(4S)-[2 \mathrm{H}] \mathrm{NADPH}$ was prepared by incubating BS-GDH ($0.8 \mathrm{U} \cdot \mathrm{mL}^{-1}$) with d-[1-$^{2} \mathrm{H}]$ glucose ($4 \mathrm{~mm}$) and $\mathrm{NADP}^{+}(4 \mathrm{~mm})$ in buffer A (pH 10, total vol. = $10 \mathrm{~mL}$) at $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for $2 \mathrm{~h}$. The concentration of the generated $(4S)-[2 \mathrm{H}] \mathrm{NADPH}$ was estimated to be $2.6 \mathrm{~mm}$.

Ribostamycin 1 ($25.9 \mathrm{mg}$, final conc. = $2 \mathrm{~mm}), \mathrm{NAD}^{+}(28.4 \mathrm{mg}$, final conc. = $2 \mathrm{~mm}$), sodium pyruvate ($8.8 \mathrm{mg}$, final conc. = $4 \mathrm{~mm}$), and
D-[1-²H]glucose (7.2 mg, final conc. = 4 mM) were mixed with BtrE (10 μM), BtrF (10 μM), LDH (0.75 U mL⁻¹), and BS-GDH (0.8 U mL⁻¹). Then, the solution of (4S)-[²H]NADPH was increased to 20 mL (final (4S)-[²H]NADPH conc. ≈ 1.3 mM). Reaction conditions and purification methods were the same as above. The mass of the deuterium-labeled 2 was determined to be 24.7 mg.

### Stereochemistry of the redox reaction catalyzed by BtrE: (4S)-[²H]NADH was prepared by incubating BS-GDH (0.8 U mL⁻¹) with D-[1-²H]glucose (4 mM) and NAD⁺ (4 mM) in buffer A (total vol. = 400 μL) at 37 °C for 2 h. (4R)-[²H]NADH was prepared by incubating TA-GDH (20 μM) with D-[1-²H]glucose (4 mM) and of NAD⁺ (4 mM) in buffer A (total vol. = 400 μL) at 37 °C for 2 h. The solutions containing deuterium-labeled NADH were subjected to ultracentrifugation to remove the GDHs and the pH was adjusted to by using NaOH (2 M). The concentrations of the deuterium-labeled NADH were estimated to be 1.5 mM (4S)-[²H]NADH and 1.8 mM (4R)-[²H]NADH, based on the \(A_{340}\) values for NADH.

Xylostasin 2 (1 mM, Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.), NADP⁺ (1 mM), BtrE (10 μM), and BtrF (10 μM) were mixed with 33 μL of (4S)-[²H]NADH or 28 μL of (4R)-[²H]NADH (final conc. = 1 mM), and the solution was adjusted to 50 μL with buffer B. The solutions were then incubated at 37 °C for 3 h and the reactions quenched with an equal volume of ethanol. Analysis was conducted by LC-ESI-MS, as above.

#### Reaction in the D₂O-containing buffer: A CHES buffer (0.7 mmol, final conc. = 50 mM, D₂O-buffer B) was prepared with glycerol (1.4 mL, 10%, v/v), KCl (2.8 mmol, 200 mM), NaOH (420 μL, 2 M), HCl (2 M, for adjustment to pH 9.5), and D₂O (98%, ACROS, Thermo Fischer Scientific Inc.) up to 14 mL. The D₂O ratio was estimated at ~94%. All reagents were dissolved in D₂O/buffer B. The solutions containing enzymes were then exchanged with D₂O/buffer B by ultracentrifugation. 1 (1 mM), NAD⁺ (1 mM), NADPH (1 mM), BtrE (10 μM), BtrF (10 μM), sodium pyruvate (1 mM), d-glucose (1 mM), LDH (0.75 U per 100 μL), and BS-GDH (0.05 U per 100 μL) were mixed (total vol. = 100 μL) and incubated at 37 °C for 3 h.

#### Substrate specificity of BtrE and BtrF: The substrate specificity was investigated by conducting enzymatic reactions with 1, 2, ATP, ADP, adenosine, guanosine, thymidine, ribose, and xylose. Substrates (final conc. = 1.0 mM) and NAD(P)⁺ (final conc. = 1.0 mM) were mixed in advance. Reactions were started by the addition of enzyme (BtrE or BtrF, final conc. = 5.0 μM). NAD(P)H formation was followed by measurement of \(A_{340}\) for 100 s, with the initial velocity of NAD(P)H formation estimated over 25–100 s. To estimate specific activities of BtrE (5.0 μM) and BtrF (5.0 μM), the enzymatic reaction was conducted with 1, 2, 4, and NAD(P)⁺ (0.50 mM each).

#### Kinetics: The \(K_\text{M}\) value for 1 in the BtrE reaction was evaluated using various concentrations of 1 (50–2000 μM), reacted with NAD⁺ (3 mM) and BtrE (1 μM) at 37 °C. The \(K_\text{M}\) value for NAD⁺ in the BtrE reaction was evaluated using various concentrations of NAD⁺ (50–2000 μM) reacted with 1 (3 mM) and BtrE (1 μM) at 37 °C. NADH formation (\(A_{340}\), ε = 6300 M⁻¹ cm⁻¹) was followed by UV/Vis spectroscopy to estimate the initial velocity under each substrate concentration. All data were fitted to the Michaelis–Menten equation by the least squares method to obtain \(K_\text{M}\) and \(k_\text{cat}\) values.

Epimerization at C-3′ in Butirosin  
Biosynthesis by an NAD⁺-Dependent  
Dehydrogenase BtrE and an NADPH-  
Dependent Reductase BtrF

E and F, you complete me: Two  
NAD(P)-dependent oxidoreductases,  
BtrE/BtrF, were found to catalyze the C-  
3′ epimerization of ribostamycin and  
xylostasin through a 3′-oxoribostamycin  
intermediate. BtrE/BtrF strictly recognize  
pseudo-trisaccharide structures and the  
stereochemistry of the pentose moieties. This two-step epimerization mechanism may be present in many other natural product biosynthetic pathways.
