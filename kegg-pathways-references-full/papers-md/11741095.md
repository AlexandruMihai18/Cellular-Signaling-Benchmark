# VEGF Receptor Signal Transduction

Taro Matsumoto and Lena Claesson-Welsh

(Published 11 December 2001)

The family of vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs) currently includes VEGF-A, -B, -C, -D, -E, and placenta growth factor (PIGF). Several of these factors, notably VEGF-A, exist as different isoforms, which appear to have unique biological functions. The VEGF family proteins bind in a distinct pattern to three structurally related receptor tyrosine kinases, denoted VEGF receptor-1, -2, and -3. Neuropilins, heparan-sulfated proteoglycans, cadherins, and integrin αvβ3 serve as coreceptors for certain but not all VEGF proteins. Moreover, the angiogenic response to VEGF varies between different organs and is dependent on the genetic background of the animal. Inactivation of the genes for VEGF-A and VEGF receptor-2 leads to embryonal death due to the lack of endothelial cells. Inactivation of the gene encoding VEGF receptor-1 leads to an increased number of endothelial cells, which obstruct the vessel lumen. Inactivation of VEGF receptor-3 leads to abnormally organized vessels and cardiac failure. Although VEGF receptor-3 normally is expressed only on lymphatic endothelial cells, it is up-regulated on vascular as well as nonvascular tumors and appears to be involved in the regulation of angiogenesis. A large body of data, such as those on gene inactivation, indicate that VEGF receptor-1 exerts a negative regulatory effect on VEGF receptor-2, at least during embryogenesis. Recent data imply a positive regulatory role for VEGF receptor-1 in pathological angiogenesis. The VEGF proteins are in general poor mitogens, but binding of VEGF-A to VEGF receptor-2 leads to survival, migration, and differentiation of endothelial cells and mediation of vascular permeability. This review outlines the current knowledge about the signal transduction properties of VEGF receptors, with focus on VEGF receptor-2.

## Introduction to Physiological and Pathological Vessel Formation

This review outlines the current knowledge about the function of an expanding family of growth factors, the vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs), and their receptors. The critical role of these proteins in regulating vessel formation during normal physiological processes and in different diseases has promoted intense research on their mode of action. Vessel formation occurs through a number of distinct mechanisms. During embryogenesis, vessels develop de novo in a process called vasculogenesis (1). Mesoderm-derived stem cells, called hemangioblasts, form aggregates, termed blood islands, that develop further into primitive hematopoietic and endothelial cells (angioblasts). One of the key markers defining the angioblast is the expression of one of the VEGF receptors, VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) (2). The blood islands constitute the basis for the primary vascular plexus, which matures through a number of processes (3), such as intussusception (the splitting of a vessel into two daughter vessels) and sprouting angiogenesis (the formation of new capillaries from preexisting vessels).

Vasculogenesis has been considered to be a process largely regulated by the functional demand of the tissue that is supplied; however, studies in zebrafish and *Xenopus laevis* suggest that the vascular development may be genetically regulated to a large extent (4). Gene regulation during vasculogenesis has not been systematically analyzed but can be deduced from results of gene inactivation of many different classes of proteins, which affect vascular development in different ways. These include growth factors and their receptors, such as the VEGF and VEGFR family; growth modulatory factors, such as the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) family of ligands and receptors (5); and different second messenger proteins (6). Nuclear factors such as the Id1-Id3 complex, which exert their effects by regulating the binding of helix-loop-helix factors to DNA, are essential for vascular development in the neuroectoderm as well as for tumor angiogenesis (7).

The principal mechanism of formation of new vessels in the adult appears to be angiogenesis; appropriately stimulated postcapillary beds are sites of vessel formation (8). Angiogenesis is initiated by the production of proteases, in stimulated endothelial cells, that degrade the surrounding basement membrane (9). As a consequence, endothelial cells migrate into the tissue, where they proliferate and differentiate to form a new vessel. The endothelial cells produce specific growth factors, such as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and TGF-β, to attract supporting cells, called pericytes (10). A new, highly specific basement membrane is subsequently produced, containing collagen IV, laminin 8/10, perlecan, nidogen, and fibronectin (11). Vessels surrounded by basement membrane and pericytes are regarded as mature. The concept of circulating endothelial stem cells has become widely accepted (12), and their contribution to neovascularization is increased by the presence of specific cytokines and ischemia (13).

A number of physiological processes, such as embryonic development, ovulation, and menstruation, require angiogenesis. A wide range of diseases, including tumor diseases, chronic inflammatory diseases, and diabetic retinopathy, are characterized by excessive angiogenesis, which results in hyperpermeable vessels with disorganized architecture and blind endings (14). Such pathological vessels are unstable and immature and lack a complete basement membrane and pericytes. Tumors are also reported to establish microcirculation independent of angiogenesis by formation of extracellular matrix channels that are supported by tumor cells in an as yet poorly understood process re-

ferred to as microvessel mimicry (15).

Many tumors secrete VEGF in high concentrations, and suppression of the VEGF-VEGFR signaling pathway is an intensively explored avenue for suppression of tumor growth (16). Conditions characterized by decreased vascular function, such as ischemic diseases of different kinds, may, on the other, hand be usefully treated by administration of VEGF (17). Whether all vessels are stimulated through VEGF-VEGFR action is not yet clear. It is widely accepted that most if not all embryonic vessels and proliferating endothelial cells in vessels undergoing active angiogenesis express receptors for VEGF. All vessels might not have an identical pattern of gene expression, however. St Croix *et al.* (18) identified 79 gene products that were differently expressed in endothelial cells from colon cancer, as compared with endothelial cells from normal colon vasculature. Surprisingly, and in contrast to the data by Brown *et al.* (19) on overexpression of VEGFRs in human colon cancer, St Croix *et al.* did not find differential expression of VEGFRs in tumor endothelial cells, as compared to endothelial cells from normal tissue or even nonendothelial tissue. Moreover, abundant data indicate that angiogenesis involves a plethora of growth and other modulating factors, including fibroblast growth factor (FGF) (14), PDGF (10), TGF-β, angiopoietins (20), and the ephrin family (21). Analysis of gene regulation in endothelial cells undergoing morphogenesis to form tubular structures in three-dimensional gels has allowed for the identification of a large number of gene products expressed at elevated levels during the morphogenic process, as compared to proliferating two-dimensional cultures. These include various proteases, as well as a large number of new gene products (22, 23). Clearly, the function of VEGF and its receptors must be viewed as one event in a web of many stimuli for endothelial cells and their supporting smooth muscle cells and pericytes.

### Structure of VEGF Proteins

The original VEGF (now denoted VEGF-A) was first described as a vascular permeability factor (VPF) (8). Subsequently, it was described as an endothelial cell mitogen (24, 25). Intense research has established the role of VEGF-A in vascular development and as an inducer of endothelial cell migration and survival. The denomination “VEGF” now signifies a family of structurally related dimeric glycoproteins belonging to the PDGF superfamily of growth factors. The family members VEGF-A, -B, -C, and -D and placenta growth factor (PlGF) bind with different affinities to three related receptor tyrosine kinases: VEGF receptor-1 (VEGFR-1), VEGFR-2, and VEGFR-3 (Fig. 1). The chromosomal localizations of the VEGF receptors are known (Table 1). The open reading frame (ORF) of the parapox virus family encodes a VEGF-related factor, referred to as VEGF-E, which binds only to VEGFR-2 (26, 27). In addition, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) Tat protein can interact with VEGFR-2 (28). VEGF-A is expressed as a number of splice variants, including 121-, 145-, 165-, 189-, and 206-amino acid residues in humans (29), with the 121 and 165 isoforms as the most frequently expressed variants. Exon 7 in the VEGF-A gene encodes a structural motif mediating binding to heparin (30). The 121 isoform, in which exon 7 as well as exons 6 are excluded, is freely diffusible. In contrast, the 189- and 206-amino acid isoforms contain additional stretches of basic residues that mediate their retention in the extracellular matrix (31). Analysis of the crystal structure of VEGF-A (32) has reinforced the relatedness of VEGF-A with PDGF: Both form an antiparallel homodimer covalently linked by two intermolecular disulfide bridges and contain a cysteine knot motif of eight characteristically spaced cysteine residues. Amino acid residues Arg<sup>82</sup>, Lys<sup>84</sup>, and His<sup>85</sup> in VEGF-A are critical for binding to VEGFR-2, whereas Asp<sup>63</sup>, Glu<sup>64</sup>, and Glu<sup>67</sup> are specifically required for binding of VEGFR-1, allowing the generation of VEGF-A mutants selective in their binding to either VEGFR-1 or -2 (33).

#### Expression of VEGF Family Members

During early embryogenesis, VEGF-A is expressed in the giant cells of the trophoblast (34). At later stages during embryogenesis, VEGF-A expression is detected in most organs in the mouse and human (35). This pattern is compatible with a paracrine mechanism of action by which VEGF-A from periendothelial cells modulates the adjacent vascular endothelium. VEGF-A expression is increased in areas of hypoxia that are characterized by active angiogenesis, but VEGF-A is also expressed around quiescent microvessels, implicating VEGF-A as a survival factor for differentiated endothelium (35–37).

The amount of VEGF-A mRNA increases during hypoxic conditions (38) because of the presence of hypoxia-regulated elements (HREs) in both the 5′ and 3′ ends of the VEGF-A gene (39, 40). Cells of many different types, to some extent also endothelial cells, appear to respond to hypoxia with induction of VEGF-A mRNA (41, 42). In contrast, other VEGF family members are not up-regulated during hypoxia (43); expression of PlGF has been shown to decrease under hypoxic conditions (44). VEGF-A expression is also regulated by changes in mRNA stability, and sequences that mediate this regulation have been identified in the VEGF-A mRNA 3′ untranslated region (45, 46). A wide range of cytokines (29) is known to stimulate expression of VEGF-A, in some cases through increased VEGF-A mRNA stability (47).

VEGF-B is strongly expressed in the developing heart at embryonic day (E) 11.5–12.5 (48). At later stages during embryogenesis, VEGF-B is expressed in most tissues, although the most prominent expression is found in the heart, brown fat, and the spinal cord (49).

VEGF-C mRNA is detected in many embryonic and adult tissues. At E12.5, this expression is particularly pronounced in regions where the lymphatic vessels are generated from embryonal veins (43), such as the perimetanephric, axillary, and jugular regions. The pattern of expression of VEGF-D is similar, but not identical, because this factor is prominent in lung and skin (43).

PlGF is expressed predominantly in the placenta during all stages of gestation (50). Certain types of tumors, such as hypervascular renal cell carcinomas, express elevated amounts of PlGF (51).

#### Structure of VEGF Receptors

Three structurally related receptor tyrosine kinases for the VEGF family members have been identified to date (52–56); they are denoted VEGFR-1 (Flt-1; binds VEGF-A, PlGF, and VEGF-B); VEGFR-2 (KDR in humans or Flk-1 in the mouse; binds VEGF-A, VEGF-C, VEGF-D, and VEGF-E); and VEGFR-3 (Flt-4; binds VEGF-C and VEGF-D) (Fig. 1). Generally, VEGFR-1 and -2 are expressed on vascular endothelial cells, whereas VEGFR-3 is expressed on lymphatic endothelial

Fig. 1. The interactions of VEGF family members with their receptors. The VEGF family members VEGF-A, -B, -C, -D, -E, and PIGF, and the human immunodeficiency (HIV) Tat protein bind in specific patterns to three related receptor protein tyrosine kinases, VEGFR-1, -2, and -3, and induce the formation of homo- and heteromeric receptor complexes. The extracellular domain of VEGFR-1 is also expressed as a soluble protein. PIGF and VEGF-B are selective ligands for VEGFR-1, whereas all VEGF-A isoforms bind to both VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2. VEGF-C and VEGF-D interact with both VEGFR-3 and VEGFR-2. On the other hand, VEGF-E and HIV/Tat protein bind only VEGFR-2. The non-tyrosine kinase transmembrane protein neuropilin-1 acts as a co-receptor for certain isoforms of VEGF-A and PIGF-2. Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG) may serve as an additional binding site for heparin-binding isoforms of VEGF-A that are able to modulate binding of VEGF-A to its receptors. Although both VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 are expressed in vascular endothelium, biological angiogenic activities are transduced mainly through VEGFR-2. VEGFR-1 is also expressed on monocytes, and its activation leads to chemotaxis and tissue factor (TF) production in monocytes. Although VEGFR-1-VEGFR-2 heterodimers can be induced by VEGF-A, the signaling properties of the heterodimers are largely unknown. VEGFR-3 is expressed mainly in lymphatic endothelium and is involved in lymphangiogenesis. uPA, urokinase type plasminogen activator; PAI-1, plasminogen activator inhibitor 1; EC, endothelial cell.

cells. However, cell types other than endothelial cells express VEGFR-1 and -2. Furthermore, embryonic endothelial cells express VEGFR-3, and vascular tumors and vessels in nonendothelial tumors may also express this receptor (57). All three receptors are vital for the development of the vasculature during embryogenesis.

The structural hallmarks of VEGF receptors include seven immunoglobulin (Ig)-like folds in the extracellular part of the receptors and a split tyrosine kinase domain, containing an intervening, noncatalytic, 70-amino-acid residue sequence. The extracellular domain of VEGFR-3 is composed of two peptides,

bound by a disulfide bridge (58). The third Ig-like loops in VEGFR-1 and -2 are responsible for binding VEGF-A (59-61). The tyrosine kinase domains of the three receptors are highly related (80% similar) (62).

All three receptors are modified posttranslationally by N-linked glycosylation. Upon SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, VEGFR-1, -2, and -3 migrate with apparent molecular masses of 180 kD, 230 kD, and 195 kD, respectively. The receptors are also modified by phosphorylation on serine, threonine, and tyrosine.

VEGF family members also bind with relatively high affinity.
ty to neuropilins (63), which are cell surface-expressed molecules implicated in axonal guidance and devoid of intrinsic catalytic activity. The role of neuropilins in VEGF-induced signal transduction and, consequently, their identity as true VEGF receptors is not yet clear (see below).

### Expression of VEGF Receptors

VEGFR-1 and -2 are expressed in endothelial cells in most, if not all, tissues in mouse and human embryos (64–67). During early embryonic development, the VEGFR-2 gene is first expressed in mesodermal blood island progenitors at 7.0 days post coitum and then in angioblasts surrounding the blood islands (68). VEGFR-1 is expressed later, in angioblasts at 8.5 days (66, 69). Both VEGFR-1 and -2 are expressed in relatively high amounts in vascular endothelial cells at this stage of embryonic development, followed by a significant decrease in expression of VEGFR-1 at 14.5 to 16.5 days (66, 67). The expression of VEGFR-1 is increased in newborn mice, and this receptor continues to be expressed at a relatively high level during the adult stages (66, 70). The level of expression of VEGFR-2 declines toward the end of gestation (71).

Not all vascular endothelial cells in adults express VEGFR-1 and -2. For example, vascular endothelial cells in the brain lack both VEGFR-1 and -2 expression (71). In pathologies such as tumors, the levels of VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 mRNA are significantly increased, as compared to the amounts observed in vessels of normal tissues surrounding the tumors (72–77). There appears to be a similar pattern in nontumorigenic diseases; Sato et al. (78) for example, reported increased VEGFR-1 and -2 mRNA in hyperthyroidism, a disease characterized by increased angiogenesis and overexpression of VEGF.

VEGFR-1 gene expression is regulated by hypoxia, and a binding site for hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α has been identified in the VEGFR-1 promoter (79). Hypoxia-regulated expression of VEGFR-1 has been identified in human umbilical vein endothelial (HUVE) cells (79), pericytes (80), and hypoxic microvessels in skin explant cultures (41). Under the latter conditions, the expression of VEGFR-2 mRNA was not induced, in keeping with the lack of an HIF-1α binding site in the VEGFR-2 promoter. Expression of VEGFR-2 was reported to be increased under hypoxic conditions in endothelial cells from the postnatal brain (81), but this could be an indirect effect, due to hypoxia-dependent increases in VEGF-A, rather than to the hypoxic atmosphere per se.

Expression of VEGFR-1 and -2 has been demonstrated in a range of nonendothelial cells. Monocytes, for instance, express VEGFR-1 and migrate toward VEGF-A (82, 83). VEGFR-1 is also expressed in human trophoblast and choriocarcinoma cells (84), in renal mesangial cells (85), and in vascular smooth muscle cells (86). VEGFR-2 is found in pancreatic duct cells (87), retinal progenitor cells (88), and megakaryocytes and hematopoietic cells (89). VEGFR-1 and -2 are co-expressed on Leydig cells in the mouse testis (90), on normal human testicular tissue (91), and in the myometrium (92).

Expression of VEGFR-3 is detected at E8 in developing blood vessels; expression is restricted to the venous endothelium and is absent from the dorsal aorta, the endocardium, and the yolk sac endothelial cells (93, 94). In the adult, VEGFR-3 is found largely restricted to the lymphatic vessels. However, there is also marked expression of VEG-

FR-3 in benign and malignant vascular tumors and in vessels of nonendothelial tumors, such as sarcomas, melanomas, and carcinomas (57).

### VEGF and VEGFR Function During Vasculogenesis: Gene Inactivation

Targeted inactivation of either VEGF-A or VEGFR-2 interferes with angioblast differentiation and consequently with vasculogenesis (68, 95, 96). Angioblasts can still be detected in the VEGF-A−/− animals, whereas they are completely lacking in the VEGFR-2−/− embryos. In both cases, embryos die at 8.5 to 9.5 days post coitum (68). The critical need for correct expression of VEGF-A was demonstrated by the finding that absence of only one of the two alleles led to abnormal vasculature and embryonal lethality (95, 96).

The different VEGF isoforms show differential expression patterns during mouse development and in the adult (37). The possibility that the isoforms may have distinct biological functions was examined in situ by eliminating exons 6 and 7 from the VEGF-A gene, resulting in mice expressing only VEGF-A121 (97). These mice showed impaired myocardial angiogenesis and ischemic cardiomyopathy, indicating that VEGF-A121 cannot replace the heparin-binding VEGF-A isoforms. Moreover, lack of expression of the heparin-binding VEGF isoforms results in abnormal pulmonary vascular development (37). Targeted inactivation of VEGF-B also affected cardiac function, resulting in smaller hearts and impaired recovery from cardiac ischemia (98). Mice lacking expression of PlGF show impaired pathological angiogenesis in ischemia, inflammation, wound healing, and cancer, possibly due to a critical role for PlGF in mediating recruitment of bone marrow-derived cells (99).

In VEGFR-1-deficient mice, endothelial cells and vessel-like structures are formed, but the vessels are nonpatent and filled with endothelial cells (69). The primary defect resulting in this phenotype appears to be an alteration in cell fate determination among mesenchymal cells, leading to an increased number of hemangioblasts in the VEGFR-1−/− embryos (69). Deletion of the intracellular domain of VEGFR-1, allowing synthesis and membrane expression of its extracellular domain, is compatible with normal vascular development (100), but pathological angiogenesis, such as tumor angiogenesis, is impaired

Table 1. Chromosomal localizations of the human VEGF/VEGF receptor family members.(101), in agreement with the effect of PlGF gene inactivation (99). Monocyte function is also impaired in these mice, in keeping with a role for VEGFR-1 in monocyte migration (82). The mechanism responsible for the decreased size of the endothelial cell population size mediated by VEGFR-1 may be passive. Thus, VEGFR-1 would act as a decoy by binding and neutralizing VEGF-A in the absence of catalytic activation.

Targeted inactivation of VEGFR-3 is embryonally lethal at E9.5, because of defective blood vessel development (102). Vasculogenesis and angiogenesis occur in these embryos, but large vessels are abnormally organized, with defective lumen formation, leading to fluid accumulation in the pericardial cavity and consequent cardiovascular failure. Hematopoiesis is affected in the VEGFR-3⁻/⁻ animals, most likely secondary to the endothelial cell defect (103).

### Modulation of VEGFR Signal Transduction

#### Co-receptors. The first group of co-receptors we discuss are the cadherins. Rahimi and Kazlauskas (104) observed that tyrosine phosphorylation of VEGFR-2 is influenced by the density of the endothelial cells and the presence of divalent cations in the medium. Treatment of densely seeded cells with a neutralizing vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin antibody increased the extent of VEGFR-2 tyrosine phosphorylation, suggesting that cell-cell contacts regulate VEGFR-2 activation. Caveda *et al.* also implicated VE-cadherin in cell contact-dependent inhibition of endothelial cell growth through reduced sensitivity to VEGF-A stimulation (105). On the other hand, targeted inactivation of VE-cadherin in mice leads to collapse of vascular development and embryonal death (106), indicating the need for fine-tuned balance in vasculogenesis.

Integrin αᵥβ₃ also functions as a co-receptor in VEGFR signal transduction. VEGFR-2 has been demonstrated to form complexes with the integrin αᵥβ₃, which is specifically expressed on angiogenic endothelium. This interaction is dependent on the extracellular domains of the αᵥ and β₃ integrin chains, but is independent of activation of VEGFR-2 (107). Other integrins, such as the β₁ integrin, do not form complexes with VEGFR-2. Activation of αᵥβ₃ by plating cells on vitronectin results in increased VEGFR-2 kinase activity and augmented VEGF-A-mediated mitogenicity (108). These data are interesting in view of the finding of Friedlander *et al.* (109) that proliferating vessels express increased levels of αᵥβ₃ and that angiogenesis can be decreased by blocking αᵥβ₃ function. The αᵥβ₃ integrin also interacts with other growth factor receptors, such as PDGF receptor-β and the insulin receptor (107).

Neuropilin-1 and -2 are widely expressed, structurally related, cell surface molecules with short cytoplasmic tails that appear to lack endogenous catalytic function. The neuropilins interact with class 3 semaphorin/collapsin proteins (such as Sema/3A), which are secreted molecules involved in axonal guidance. In past years, it has been shown that neuropilins also bind VEGF, in an isoform-specific manner. Soker *et al.* (63) reported that VEGF-A165 binds to neuropilin-1; subsequently, VEGF-A145 (110), PlGF-2 (111), VEGF-B (112), and VEGF-E (113) have all been shown to bind to neuropilin-1 or -2. Exon 7 in VEGF-A is involved in neuropilin binding, thereby excluding VEGF121 from this interaction (63). In agreement with the fact that exon 7 conveys binding to heparin, the interaction between VEGF-A165 and neuropilin is heparin-dependent and results in increased affinity for VEGFR-2 (114). The exact composition

of the complex of VEGF-A, neuropilin, VEGFR-2, and heparan sulfate has not been resolved (115).

Targeted inactivation of the neuropilin-1 gene leads to defects in both neuronal and vascular development (116–118). Moreover, overexpression of neuropilin-1 leads to deregulated angiogenesis (119) and increased tumor growth (120). Naturally occurring soluble neuropilin-1 acts as a tumor antagonist, probably through withdrawal of VEGF from the cell surface (121). The role of neuropilin is not yet clear; it appears to efficiently present VEGF family members to their receptors, but neuropilins may also engage in signal transduction: The cytoplasmic domain of neuropilin-1 interacts with PDZ domain-containing molecules (122). Moreover, Sema3A binds with high affinity to complexes of neuropilin-1 and plexin-1, the latter being a mediator of Sema3A-neuropilin-1 signaling (123), leading to morphological changes of cells. Whether plexins also are involved in the transduction of neuropilin/VEGF effects on endothelial cells remains to be shown.

Additionally, the polysaccharides heparin and heparan sulfate act as co-receptors for VEGFR signaling. Exon seven of the VEGF-A gene confers heparin-binding ability on VEGF-A isoforms of 165, 189, and 206 amino acid residues (124). A heparin-binding site also has been identified in the extracellular domain of VEGFR-2 (125). Treatment of VEGFR-2-expressing cells with a synthetic peptide encompassing this heparin-binding site prevents binding of VEGF-A165. The full-length and soluble forms of VEGFR-1 also show affinity for heparin (126). Thus, soluble VEGFR-1 and full-length VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 appear to associate with heparan sulfates or heparin-like molecules on the cell surface. Furthermore, the soluble form of VEGFR-1 may be retained by the extracellular matrix. Data indicating that the binding of VEGF-A to VEGFR-1 and -2 is differentially regulated by heparin have been presented; binding of VEGF-A to VEGFR-1 is inhibited by heparin, whereas its binding to VEGFR-2 is stimulated by heparin (127). However, even if VEGF-A-binding to VEGFR-1 decreases in the presence of heparin, the VEGFR-1 kinase activity is increased by heparin treatment (128). Thus, the role of heparin and heparan sulfates in VEGF-VEGFR function is likely to be complex and depends on the interacting molecules and the endothelial cell type involved.

#### Phosphatases. Phosphatases have been implicated in the regulation of growth factor receptor activity. The Src homology 2 (SH2) domain-containing tyrosine phosphatases SHP-1 and SHP-2 have been shown to associate with VEGFR-2 in vitro (129). The biological consequences of these interactions have not been addressed. Treatment of endothelial cells with tumor necrosis factor leads to the formation of complexes between SHP-1 and VEGFR-2 and to subsequent dephosphorylation of VEGFR-2 (130). Thus, VEGFR-2 may be a substrate for SHP-1. A human low-molecular-weight phosphotyrosine phosphatase, denoted HCPTPA, was identified by yeast two-hybrid screening as a VEGFR-2-associated protein (131). Overexpression of HCPTPA in HUVE cells leads to suppression of VEGF-A-induced cellular responses, in agreement with the notion that VEGFR-2 is a substrate for this phosphatase also. It is conceivable that these and other phosphatases expressed in endothelial cells negatively regulate activation and signal transduction by VEGFR-1 and -2. The possibility that the VEGF receptors directly stimulate activation of tyrosine phosphatases in endothelial cells has not been extensively examined. Wong *et al.* (132) reported that VEGF-A stimulation of HUVE cells resulted in
dephosphorylation of serine and threonine residues in a cad-
herin-associated molecule denoted p120, implying that VEGF
receptors activate a serine-threonine phosphatase.

**Rho Kinase Regulation.** Modulating the function of the small
guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) RhoA affects VEGFR-2 acti-
vation. Treatment of bovine aortic endothelial cells with cytotoxic
necrotizing factor type 1 (CNF1), a RhoA-activating toxin, or with
a dominant-active RhoA led to increased levels of tyrosine-phos-
phorylated VEGFR-2, whereas inhibition of Rho function had the
opposite effect (133). The pathway for the RhoA-dependent acti-
vation of VEGFR-2 has not been identified.

**Genetic and Organ-Specific Variation in the Angiogenic Re-
sponse to VEGF.** Recent evidence suggests that the genetic
background influences the extent of the angiogenic response.
Rohan and co-workers (134) examined FGF-2-induced corneal
angiogenesis in a wide range of inbred mouse strains. Forma-
tion of a 1.5-mm² area of new vessels required a dose of 5 ng of
FGF-2 for the “high responder” strain 129/SvImJ and of 50 ng
of FGF-2 for the “low responder” strain C57VL/6J. In most
strains, the response was dose-dependent, but certain strains
such as SJL/J responded weakly at all doses tested. The SJL/J
strain also failed to respond to systemic treatment with angio-
genesis inhibitors. Hence, physiological as well as pathological
angiogenesis in humans might also vary among individuals. An-
giogenesis also varies in an organ-specific manner. Pettersson *et*
*al.* (135) examined adenovirus-directed overexpression of
VEGF-A and showed that the initial angiogenic response was
similar in a various tissues, including skeletal muscle, my-
ocardium, ear and flank skin, perimuscular fat, and peritoneal
lining tissues. However, the duration of the angiogenic response
differed considerably in different organs; it was transient in the
heart and skeletal muscle but persisted for months or indefinite-
ly in the skin and fat.

**Signal Transduction**

The microvasculature is specialized to meet the needs of the or-
gans it serves (136). Endothelial cells derived from different
types of vessels are also likely to have different properties, as
evidenced by the fact that endothelial cells from large vessels
form tubular structures in vitro only after prolonged incubation,
as compared to endothelial cells derived from capillaries (137).
Moreover, primary endothelial cells in tissue culture probably
respond differently to growth factor stimulation, as compared to
transformed endothelial cells or receptor-transfected nonen-
dothelial cells (138). The current knowledge of VEGF receptor
signal transduction is outlined below. Both primary endothelial
cells and stable endothelial cell lines, derived from different
vessels, organs, and species, have been used, and it is possible,
indeed likely, that the cell model affects the experimental out-
come.

VEGF receptor signal transduction appears to follow the
consensus scheme for activation of receptor tyrosine kinases.
Binding of the growth factor induces receptor dimerization,
which, for VEGFR-2, is dependent on Ig-like domain 3 of the
extracellular domain (59–61). Dimerization, in turn, triggers ki-
nase activation. Substrates for the kinase include the receptor it-
self and several cytoplasmic signal transduction molecules.
These proteins are often equipped with one or several motifs
that mediate protein-protein interactions, such as the SH2 do-
main, whose binding specificity to phosphotyrosine residues is
conferred by amino acid residues located immediately COOH-
terminal to the phosphotyrosine (139). The signaling molecules
are often enzymes or are associated with enzymes, and phos-
phorylation of these molecules affects their enzymatic activity.

**VEGFR-1.** VEGFR-1 binds VEGF-A with an affinity of
*K*~d~ ~10 pM [see Shibuya *et al.* (62) for references]. However,
VEGFR-1-expressing cells in culture show a poor mitogenic re-
sponse to VEGF stimulation. Increased kinase activity can be
observed in cells engineered to overexpress VEGFR-1, and the
expression of the isolated intracellular domain of VEGFR-1 in
baculovirus allows for aggregation-induced kinase activation
(140). Through such experiments, a number of phosphorylation
sites in the VEGFR-1 have been determined (140–142) (Fig. 2),
and these phosphorylation sites may serve as binding sites for
SH2 domain-binding proteins. Thus, increased tyrosine phos-
phorylation of phospholipase C-γ (PLC-γ), Crk, and SHP-2 has
been observed in VEGF-A-stimulated porcine aortic endothelial
(PAE) cells overexpressing VEGFR-1. It has not been possible
to determine the role of these interactions, because exchange of
individual tyrosine residues for phenylalanine residues leads to
deregulated kinase activity (143, 144).

In vivo, VEGFR-1 is critical for negative regulation of the
hemangioblast pool during development (69, 145). This nega-
tive regulation appears to be independent of kinase activity
(100) and may be mediated through the binding and sequester-
ing of VEGF-A. This concept is compatible with the fact that
the exact dosage of VEGF-A is important during vascular de-
velopment (95, 96). Although recent data implicate VEGFR-1
in pathological angiogenesis (99, 101), the molecular mecha-
nisms are unclear. A number of in vitro studies suggest that en-
dothelial cells respond to VEGF-A mainly through VEGFR-2
signaling and that VEGFR-1 is not critical for migration, prolif-
eration, or differentiation of endothelial cells (143, 146). Gille
*et al.* employed VEGF-A’s mutated to selectively bind to either
VEGFR-1 or -2 to reach this conclusion (147); similar results
have been obtained using PlGF to specifically activate VEGFR-
1 and VEGF-E to specifically active VEGFR-2 (27, 148). On
the other hand, Kanno *et al.* used receptor-neutralizing antibod-
ies to show that VEGFR-1 function is required for migration of
HUVE cells toward VEGF-A (149). Moreover, VEGF-A stimu-
lates the migration of monocytes, which express VEGFR-1
(82). In agreement with this, targeted inactivation of the intra-
cellular domain of VEGFR-1 in mice led to a defect in
hematopoiesis (100). The reasons for these discrepancies con-
cerning VEGFR-1 function are not clear at present, but a num-
ber of factors that may complicate the analysis of VEGFR-1
function may be considered, as outlined below.

The kinase activity of VEGFR-1 may be low because of a
lack of positively regulated kinase activity, or may appear low
on account of few and tightly regulated phosphorylation sites.
Moreover, negative regulatory sequences that suppress kinase
activity may exist. Gille *et al.* identified a “repressor” sequence
in the VEGFR-1 juxtamembrane domain (150). Exchange of
this repressor sequence with the corresponding domain from
VEGFR-2 allowed the resulting chimeric VEGFR-1 to respond
to VEGF-A by activation of PI3K and induction of endothelial
cell migration but not proliferation. Thus, these data indicate
that the VEGFR-1 kinase function is not defective per se but
that the receptor is unable to couple to one (for example, PI3K)
or several signal transduction molecules. Additionally, naturally
occurring soluble forms of VEGFR-1 and -2 have been identi-
fied that exert a negative regulatory influence on endothelial

cell proliferation (151-153).

Other regulators that influence the kinase activity of VEGFR include the neuropilins. The neuropilin-1 extracellular domain binds with high affinity to Ig-like loops 3 and 4 in the extracellular domain of VEGFR-1; this prevents binding of neuropilin-1 to VEGF-A165 (114) and leads to reduced biological effects of VEGF-A.

Expression and activation of phosphatases in endothelial cells might influence the level of kinase activation of VEGFR-1. Such phosphatases, which would have to be specific for VEGFR-1, remain to be identified.

It is also possible that the number of VEGFR-1 molecules expressed on primary endothelial cells is relatively low, which might affect the detection of VEGFR-1 activity. Additionally, the lack of good antibodies to VEGFR-1 has complicated analyses of VEGFR-1 function.

Overexpression of soluble VEGFR-1 leads to decreased binding of VEGF-A to VEGFR-2 and to reduced VEGFR-2 signaling (151-153), either by sequestration of VEGF-A or by the creation of dominant-negative VEGFR-1-VEGFR-2 heterodimers. Heterodimers of VEGFR-1 and -2 may also be formed in VEGF-A-treated cells expressing intact receptors, because VEGF-A binds with high affinity to both receptor types. Receptor heterodimers may also be induced by growth factor heterodimers (for example, PlGF-VEGF-A heterodimers) (154, 155). Huang *et al.* showed that VEGFR-1 and -2 heterodimers are induced by VEGF-A in PAE cells and that the heterodimers signal with an efficiency equal to or greater than that of the VEGFR-2 homodimers (156).

VEGFR-1 may also influence VEGFR-2 signaling through mechanisms involving active rather than passive (that is, sequestration of VEGF-A, thereby preventing binding to VEGFR-2) signal transduction. Rahimi *et al.* analyzed the properties of chimeric receptors composed of the extracellular domain of the colony stimulating factor-1 receptor fused to the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of VEGFR-1 or -2 (143). In this study, the VEGFR-1 intracellular domain exerted a negative effect on VEGFR-2-mediated cell proliferation, independent of

binding and neutralization of VEGF-A. Zeng *et al.* (157) fused the extracellular domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor to the transmembrane and intracellular domains of VEGFR-1 and -2. In this model, activation of the VEGFR-1 kinase led to suppression of VEGFR-2-mediated endothelial cell proliferation, but not migration, in a PI3K-dependent manner. The inhibitory signaling from VEGFR-1 was dependent on the juxtamembrane tyrosine residue Tyr<sup>794</sup>, which has been shown by Cunningham *et al.* (158) to bind the regulatory PI3K subunit in a constitutive manner.

VEGFR-2. The binding affinity of VEGF-A for VEGFR-2 is lower (*K*<sub>d</sub> ~ 75 to 125 pM) than for VEGFR-1 (*K*<sub>d</sub> ~ 10 pM) (159), but the biological activities of VEGF-A are thought to be transduced mainly by VEGFR-2. Binding of VEGF-A to VEGFR-2 causes receptor dimerization, kinase activation, and autophosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues within the dimeric complex. So far, Tyr<sup>951</sup>, Tyr<sup>996</sup>, Tyr<sup>1054</sup>, Tyr<sup>1059</sup>, Tyr<sup>1175</sup>, and Tyr<sup>1214</sup> in VEGFR-2 have been shown to serve as autophosphorylation sites (160, 161) (Fig. 2). Tyr<sup>1054</sup> and Tyr<sup>1059</sup> are located in the activation loop of the tyrosine kinase domain and are required for maximal activation of the VEGFR-2 kinase (162). Mutation of Tyr<sup>1059</sup> leads to loss of VEGFR-2-mediated intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization and ERK phosphorylation. Tyr<sup>1059</sup> thus appears to be crucially involved in mediating signals for proliferation, but not migration of HUVE cells (163). Tyr<sup>951</sup> and Tyr<sup>996</sup> are located in the kinase insert, and Tyr<sup>951</sup> is essential for VEGF-A-induced HUVE cell migration (163). The amino acid sequences of the kinase insert domains of VEGFR-1 and -2 show relatively low similarity (51% identity), as compared with other regions in the intracellular domains (78% identity) (62), which has been interpreted to mean that the kinase insert domain is vital for signal transduction of VEGFR-2-specific biological responses. Tyr<sup>1175</sup> and Tyr<sup>1214</sup> are located in the COOH-terminal tail. It has been shown that phosphorylated Tyr<sup>1175</sup> presents a binding site for PLC-γ in intact cells, which is involved in VEGFR-2-mediated cell proliferation (161).

Several studies mainly based on the yeast two-hybrid system reveal that SH2 domain-containing proteins directly associate with specific tyrosine-phosphorylated residues of VEGFR-2 (summarized in Fig. 2); however, the biological significance of these interactions remains poorly understood. A number of signal transduction molecules are activated or modified in response to VEGF-A stimulation of primary endothelial cells. These include PI3K (164-168); PLC-γ (161, 165, 166, 169); the Src family of tyrosine kinases (174, 176); Ras GTPase-activating protein (Ras GAP) (165); Nck (165); focal adhesion kinase (FAK) (169, 172, 177); Akt/protein kinase B (PKB) (164, 172, 178); protein kinase C (PKC) (166, 170-173); Raf-1 (170, 179); MEK (170); extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) (168, 170, 172, 180, 181); and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) (177, 182). Moreover, in VEGFR-2 transfected cells, Grb2 (129), Shc (129), STAT (184), and the tyrosine phosphatases SHP-1 and -2 (129) are tyrosine-phosphorylated after VEGF-A stimulation. The protein tyrosine phosphatase HCPTPA directly associates with VEGFR-2, thereby regulating VEGF-A-induced autophosphorylation of VEGFR-2 and ERK activation (131). The SH2 domain-containing proteins and their downstream effectors known to be activated by VEGF-A, and the signaling pathways they mediate, are discussed below and summarized in Fig. 3.

Gene targeting of different signaling molecules has helped to identify critical signal transduction pathways downstream of VEGFR-2, preferentially in vasculogenesis. Raf-1 null mice die during embryogenesis and display vascular defects in the yolk sac and placenta (184). Interestingly, the vascular defects in Raf-1 null mice can be rescued by knock-in of a mutated Raf-1 gene, which lacks the ability to activate MEK, suggesting that MEK kinase activity downstream of Raf-1 is not essential for vasculogenesis. Disruption of the p38α gene also results in embryonic lethality due to vascular defects in the placenta (185, 186). A similar phenotype was noted in mice lacking expression of MEKK3, a p38 MAPK kinase kinase (187). It has not been directly demonstrated that VEGF acts as an upstream activator of Raf, p38, and MEKK3 during embryonic development. For certain other signaling molecules, the involvement of VEGF is more apparent. For example, target inactivation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) inhibits VEGF-A-induced angiogenesis and the increase of vascular permeability (188). Mice lacking expression of individual Src family kinases do not show vascular defects, but inactivation of Src or Yes together results in impaired VEGF-A-induced vascular permeability and decreased infarct volumes after stroke (176, 189). Removal of the cytoplasmic domain of VE-cadherin in vivo results in endothelial apoptosis via interruption of VEGF-A-induced complex formation of VE-cadherin, VEGFR-2, β-catenin, and PI3K, leading to decreased activation of Akt/PKB and a consequent lack of up-regulation of the Bcl-2 gene (106). Formation of these multiprotein complexes appears to be critical for VEGFR-2-dependent endothelial survival.

The classical PI3K is a heterodimer consisting of a p85 regulatory subunit (existing as α and β forms) and a p110 catalytic subunit (existing as α, β, and δ forms) that has been implicated as a critical factor in the control of a variety of cellular functions, including cell migration, proliferation, and survival. VEGF-A stimulates p85 subunit tyrosine phosphorylation and increased PI3K enzymatic activity in a variety of endothelial cells (164-168)--with the exception of sinusoidal endothelial cells (170)--through VEGFR-2 (150, 168, 190). It is unclear how the p85 subunit of PI3K associates with VEGFR-2. The intracellular domain of VEGFR-2 lacks the specific sequence motif pTyr-X-X-Met for binding to the p85 SH2 domain; therefore, it is conceivable that binding and activation of PI3K are mediated by an adaptor molecule. Carmeliet *et al.* (106) implicated VE-cadherin and β-catenin in PI3K activation in response to VEGF-A. It has also been proposed that Src kinases act as upstream regulators of VEGF-A-induced PI3K activity (191). A more recent study using PAE cells expressing VEGFR-2 showed that VEGF-A stimulation leads to formation of a complex between FAK and PI3K and that FAK is required for PI3K activation (190).

Activation of PI3K results in accumulation of phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP<sub>3</sub>), which in turn mediates membrane targeting and phosphorylation of Akt/PKB by binding to its pleckstrin homology (PH) domain. Gerber *et al.* demonstrated that VEGF-A-induced cell survival in HUVE cells is dependent on the activities of PI3K and Akt/PKB (164). Known downstream targets for Akt/PKB include the proapoptotic proteins BAD, FKHR1, and caspase-9, whose phosphorylation by Akt/PKB inhibits apoptosis (192, 193). Moreover, VEGF-A induces expression of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 (194) and the inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) family members XIAP and survivin (195) in HUVE cells, suggesting that these pro-

Fig. 3. Schematic illustration of VEGFR-2 signaling. After receptor dimerization and autophosphorylation, several SH2 domain-containing signal transduction molecules (blue) are activated either directly by receptor binding, such as PLC-γ, VRAP, and Sck, or by indirect mechanisms, such as Src and PI3K. A number of downstream signal transduction molecules (green) are thereby activated and mediate different pathways leading to cellular functions such as cell proliferation, migration, and survival. Activation of PKC plays a crucial role in VEGF-A mitogenic signaling via the Raf-MEK-ERK pathway. Cell survival signal is mainly mediated through PI3K-mediated activation of Akt/PKB. Activation of PI3K, FAK, and p38 MAPK is also implicated in cell migration signaling. Bold arrows, positive stimulation; bold lines, inhibition; fine arrows, interactions not well established.

teins also play an important role in endothelial cell survival.
PI3K activation is required for cell migration induced by many growth factors, such as PDGF, epidermal growth factor, and insulin-like growth factor-1 (196). VEGF-A-induced endothelial cell migration is also PI3K-dependent, based on the use of the PI3K inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002 (147, 150, 190). Downstream effectors of PI3K activity in VEGF-A-induced cell migration have not yet been identified, but members of the Rho family of small GTPases are likely candidates. Recently, Dimmeler et al. demonstrated that Akt/PKB-dependent phosphorylation of eNOS at Ser<sup>1177</sup> is required for VEGF-A-dependent cell motility (179).

PLC-γ is a 145-kD protein composed of two SH2 domains and one SH3 domain. Several studies have shown that PLC-γ is tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to VEGF-A in primary endothelial cells (165, 166, 169–175), as well as in VEGFR-2-transfected cells (138, 197). Although PLC-γ can bind directly to both VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2, in the yeast two-hybrid analysis and in conventional biochemical analyses (198), recent findings using receptor-specific ligands indicate that VEGFR-2 but not VEGFR-1 mediates PLC-γ phosphorylation (147, 172). PLC-γ may also be activated downstream of the VEGF receptors by Src, as described by He et al. (174). Phosphorylated PLC-γ catalyzes the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP<sub>2</sub>), creating inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP<sub>3</sub>) and diacylglycerol (DAG), which are known to stimulate the release of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from internal stores and activate PKC, respectively (Fig. 3). Indeed, increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> release in response to VEGF-A has been demonstrated in VEGFR-1-expressing *X. laevis* oocytes (199) and HUVE cells (200). VEGF-A-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization may be involved in short-term production of nitric oxide production and prostacyclin (PGI<sub>2</sub>) (174). Moreover, VEGF-A-induced activation of PKC is essential for endothelial cell survival.

Fig. 4. The VEGF-targeted strategies for tumor angiogenesis. It is well established that tumor progression is angiogenesis-dependent. Many tumor cell lines secrete VEGF-A in vitro, and amounts of VEGF-A mRNA are increased in most human tumors. Tumor hypoxia induces binding of HIF-1α to the HRE in the VEGF-A gene promoter region, which in turn increases VEGF-A expression in the tumor cells. Overproduction of VEGF-A is a major factor underlying tumor angiogenesis. Thus, several strategies have been developed for targeting the VEGF pathway as part of antiangiogenic treatment. Potential approaches for blocking VEGF action include inhibiting synthesis and secretion of VEGF through the use of antisense oligonucleotides, neutralizing VEGF-A by VEGF-A antibodies or soluble VEGFR, and preventing VEGF-A binding to VEGFR-2 and subsequent signal transduction by VEGFR-2 antibodies, peptide antagonists of VEGF-A, or VEGFR-2-selective tyrosine kinase inhibitors. A number of these strategies are currently being tested in phase I, II, and III clinical trials.

The PKC family consists of serine-threonine kinases that are important in intracellular signaling. VEGF-A-stimulated PKC activation in a variety of endothelial cells is important for regulating mitogenic responses (166, 170-172). VEGF-A activates the Raf-MEK-ERK pathway, which plays a central role in the stimulation of endothelial cell proliferation. In contrast to the effect of other growth factors, VEGF-A-stimulated ERK activation and subsequent DNA synthesis are abrogated by treatment with PKC inhibitors (166, 170-172, 181). This finding suggests that the mitogenic effect of VEGF-A is transduced mainly through a PKC-dependent pathway.

The different PKC isoforms have different regulatory and biochemical properties. It is likely that endothelial cells exhibit vessel-, organ-, and species-specific expression of the various PKC isoforms. For instance, the PKC isoforms α, βI, βII, δ, ε, and ζ are expressed in bovine aortic endothelial cells. In this cell type, VEGF-A stimulates PKC-α and PKC-βII activities, as evidenced by translocation of PKC from the cytosol to the particulate fraction. VEGF-A-stimulated mitogenicity is inhibited by the PKC-β-selective inhibitor LY333531 and is augmented by antisense PKC-α oligonucleotide treatment (166). On the other hand, the PKC isoforms α, δ, ε, and ζ have been identified in HUVE cells, where VEGF-A stimulates PKC-α and PKC-ζ translocation. VEGF-A-induced HUVE cell proliferation is inhibited by both antisense PKC-α and PKC-β oligonucleotides (173). Because the atypical PKC-ζ is known not to be activated by DAG or Ca²⁺, activation of this isoform may be mediated by a PLC-γ-independent pathway. Recent studies have demonstrated that PKC activation also mediates VEGF-A-induced prostacyclin production in HUVE cells (171) and eNOS expression in bovine capillary endothelial cells (201).

Ras activation, leading to activation of the Raf-1-MEK-ERK cascade, is of critical importance for growth stimulation downstream of most protein tyrosine kinase receptors. A major route from the receptors to Ras activation involves direct association of the adaptor protein Grb2 to the receptor and subsequent stimulation of the guanine-nucleotide exchange protein Sos. Grb2 may bind to pTyr¹²¹⁴ in the COOH-terminal tail of VEGFR-2, which contains a putatively pTyr-Asp-Asn-Thr sequence matching the Grb2 SH2-binding motif (202). Another potential route is mediated by the adaptor protein Shc. VEGF-A stimulates Shc phosphorylation and promotes formation of Shc-Grb2 complexes in PAE cells expressing VEGFR-2 (129). Doanes *et al.* have

shown that VEGF-A stimulates binding of labeled GTP to Ras in HUVE cells (181); however, the involvement of Ras in VEGFR signaling is not yet well established. There is no evidence that VEGF-stimulated Shc-Grb2 actually leads to activation of Ras or the ERK pathway. Moreover, several groups have shown that VEGF-A induces PKC-dependent and Ras-independent induction of the Raf-MEK-ERK pathway in sinusoidal endothelial cells (170) and in HUVE cells (181).

Eliceiri *et al.* reported that Src family kinases are activated by VEGF-A in avian endothelial cells (176). The results of this study also implicated Src family kinases in VEGF-A-induced but not FGF-2-induced angiogenesis and VEGF-A-induced vascular permeability. Further, it has been suggested that Src may play a role in endothelial cell survival through the regulation of PI3K activity (191). Among Src family kinases, Src, Yes, and Fyn are all expressed in endothelial cells (203, 204). Mice lacking expression of individual Src family kinases, Src⁻/⁻ or Yes⁻/⁻ but not Fyn⁻/⁻, showed impaired VEGF-induced vascular permeability; in contrast, inactivation of individual Src family kinases did not affect VEGF-A-induced angiogenesis (176). He *et al.* showed that Src exists in complex with VEGFR-2 in VEGF-A-treated bovine aortic endothelial cells (174). However, there is no obvious binding motif for the Src SH2 domain in the VEGFR-2 intracellular domain.

The cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase FAK and its putative substrate paxillin are activated by VEGF-A in HUVE cells (169, 172, 177) through VEGFR-2 (149, 177). Activation of FAK and paxillin leads to recruitment of actin-anchoring proteins such as talin and vinculin to the focal adhesion plaque. These events are thought to be essential for VEGF-A-induced endothelial cell migration and actin reorganization. Although signal mediators linking VEGFR-2 and FAK have not been fully identified, PKC, but not ERK1/2 (149), appears to be involved. In addition, Rousseau *et al.* demonstrated that HSP90 is an essential signal transduction regulator connecting VEGF-A signaling to FAK (177). VEGF-A also stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of the FAK-related cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase Pyk2 [also termed “related adhesion focal tyrosine kinase” (RAFTK)] in a bone marrow endothelial cell line (205).

VEGF-A stimulation of endothelial cells results in rapid generation of NO and in increased transcription of eNOS. NO and eNOS have been implicated in a variety of VEGF-A-induced cellular responses, including endothelial cell proliferation, migration, tube formation, increased vascular permeability, and angiogenesis (206–211). VEGFR-2 mediates VEGF-A-driven production of NO and eNOS in HUVE cells (212, 213) and bovine capillary endothelial cells (201). Akt/PKB directly activates eNOS (214, 215) in a manner dependent on HSP90 to allow prolonged NO release (216, 217). Furthermore, PKC activation (201) and Ca²⁺ mobilization (174) are required for eNOS expression, suggesting multiple routes for regulation of VEGF-A-induced NO production.

The p38 MAPK family, classically included in the family of stress-activated kinases, is activated by VEGF-A in HUVE cells (149, 150, 182). The observed effects of a specific inhibitor of p38 MAPK, SB203580, show that activation of p38 is required for VEGF-induced cell motility responses such as cell migration and actin reorganization (182). The question of which of the VEGF receptors mediates activation of p38 is controversial (149, 177), but the use of receptor-specific VEGF-A mutant proteins implicates VEGFR-2 in activation of p38 (150). The F-actin polymerizing factor HSP27 is thought to be a downstream effector of p38 MAPK (182).

**VEGFR-3.** VEGFR-3 is clearly involved in the regulation of lymphangiogenesis. Primary human lymphedema has been mapped to missense mutations in VEGFR-3 that result in inactivation of the tyrosine kinase (218). Moreover, overexpression of VEGF-C in transgenic mice leads to lymphatic endothelial cell proliferation and vessel enlargement (219), thereby promoting metastasis in mouse pancreatic and breast tumor models (220, 221). Similar results were seen for tumors overexpressing VEGF-D (222). Moreover, lymphangiogenesis can be inhibited by treatment with soluble VEGFR-3 (223, 224). On the other hand, tumor vessels express VEGFR-3 (57), the expression levels of VEGFR-3 and VEGF-C are increased in breast tumor vessels (225), and VEGF-C promotes angiogenesis in the chick embryo and the mouse cornea (226).

There are two forms of VEGFR-3 in humans, because of integration of an endogenous retrovirus. The long form has an additional COOH-terminal stretch of 65 amino acid residues containing three tyrosine residues (227). The adaptor molecule Shc binds to the Tyr¹³³⁷ residue in the activated long VEGFR-3 and promotes VEGFR-3-dependent cell proliferation by activation of the Ras pathway.

Pyk2 is a substrate for VEGFR-3. Signaling downstream of Pyk2 involves activation of the serine kinases ERK and Jun NH₂-terminal kinase (Jnk) and tyrosine phosphorylation of the focal adhesion protein paxillin (228). Lymphatic endothelial cells have only recently become available for tissue culture studies (229). The signal capacity of VEGFR-3 may be differently displayed in such a cell model.

# Conclusions and Perspectives

The VEGF family of ligands and receptors has received intense attention in the past decade. One major interest has been to develop VEGF-based therapy to treat diseases involving excess or deficient angiogenesis. For inhibiting angiogenesis, strategies include the use of neutralizing antibodies against VEGF-A or VEGFR-2, antisense oligonucleotides, negative regulatory peptides, soluble receptors, and ATP analogs to inhibit the kinase activity of VEGFR (Fig. 4). Some of these therapies are now in clinical trials (see http://cancertrials.nci.nih.gov/news/angio/). Treatment aimed at increasing neovascularization includes administration of different VEGF ligands, such as VEGF-A165 or VEGF-C (230), or using adenovirus-mediated gene transfer or other methods for gene therapy. The main disease categories for treatment to increase angiogenesis are currently cardiac and peripheral limb ischemia.

The development of treatments intended for regulation of angiogenesis has been impressively rapid, and these are expected to have a profound effect on therapeutic strategies for diseases such as cancer in the coming years. However, the current approaches may be blunted by the complexity of the angiogenic process. Once perceived as restricted in their action to endothelial cells, VEGFs are now known to act on other cell types. Moreover, although VEGF-A stimulates migration and survival of endothelial cells and is unique among growth factors in its ability to induce vascular permeability, it appears not to be a very powerful mitogen for endothelial cells. Stimulation of angiogenesis involves a wide spectrum of agents with potential roles in special aspects of vessel formation, such as branching and fusion. Generation, recruitment, and differentiation of circulatory cells are also important.
culating angioblasts may require a distinct set of stimulating factors. Potent inhibition of angiogenesis may therefore require treatments that act more broadly than on VEGF receptors alone. With increased skills in isolation of individual endothelial cells from different tissues and with the availability of sophisticated techniques for analysis of gene regulation, our awareness of the complexity of endothelial cell regulation is likely to increase. There is reason to suspect that gene expression varies considerably from one type of endothelial cell to another, depending on the particular organ and the particular type of vessel and on whether the vessel is engaged in active angiogenesis.

An interesting perspective on angiogenesis is offered by the many similarities between vessel and nerve organization and regulation. Vessels and nerves follow the same patterning during embryogenesis and often run in parallel in the tissues. There are several examples of protein families that play roles in both vessel and nerve functions. One such example is the neuropilins, which act as co-receptors for certain VEGF ligands and as receptors for the semaphorins in axonal guidance. Another example is the family of Eph receptors and ephrin ligands, which serve important functions during embryogenesis by providing spatial cues for the development of nerves and vessels (231). Indeed, VEGFR-1 and -2 are expressed on neuronal tissue during early retinal development and have been proposed to be critical for neural retinal development independently of vascular development (232). The functions of VEGF and its receptors in neural development are possibly very similar to those in vascular development, with a critical function in one particular highly related aspect of the two processes: growth of long extensions (sprouts or axons). Comparative studies in vascular and neuronal biology will most likely make important contributions to our understanding of angiogenesis in general and of VEGF function in particular.
