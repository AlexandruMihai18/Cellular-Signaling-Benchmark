ABSTRACT

The secretion of growth hormone (GH) from somatotrophs located within the anterior pituitary gland is stimulated by endogenous hypothalamic growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) and the GH secretagogue (GHS) ghrelin, and inhibited by somatotropin-releasing inhibitory factor (SRIF, also known as somatostatin). These factors bind to specific G-protein-coupled receptors on the cell membrane, and directly or indirectly modify the properties of ion channels and second messenger systems. Ultimately this results in a change in intracellular free Ca²⁺ concentration ([Ca²⁺]i) and the secretion of GH. Somatotrophs possess a variety of ion channels on their membranes, and modification of these ion channels, especially Ca²⁺, K⁺, and Na⁺ channels, is tightly linked to intracellular Ca²⁺ levels and therefore hormone secretion. Various issues regarding receptor distribution, role of ion channels, alteration of membrane potential, and involvement of intracellular signaling system in the control of GH secretion are discussed in this review. In particular, this work will focus on ion channels and [Ca²⁺]i in somatotrophs.

1. Introduction

Growth hormone (GH), a single peptide of 191 amino acids, is an anabolic hormone that is essential for normal linear growth and the maintenance of metabolic function. Evans and Long first demonstrated the presence of GH in extracts of bovine anterior pituitary tissue [1], and showed that when administered to normal or hypophysectomized rats these extracts promote or restored growth, respectively [2,3]. GH is synthesized and stored in pituitary somatotrophs [4]. The secretion of GH occurs in a pulsatile manner, which is believed to be important for the appropriate physiological actions of GH. To date, this pattern of secretion has been confirmed in a number of mammals, including humans, pigs, sheep, rats and, recently, mice [5]. Representative examples of pulsatile GH secretion in mice are illustrated in Fig. 1.

Normal pulsatile secretion of GH depends on the appropriate structure and function of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis [6]. Two key central regulatory factors are known to modulate the pulsatile secretion of GH, stimulatory GH-releasing hormone (GHRH), and inhibitory somatostatin (SRIF), while ghrelin is thought to contribute to pulsatile GH secretion [5]. GHRH and SRIF interact with each other within the hypothalamus and reach the somatotrophs through the hypothalamic-pituitary portal system. Circulating ghrelin is predominantly secreted by the stomach and acts both directly and indirectly upon somatotrophs. In addition, a number of metabolic substrates (glucose, free fatty acids), cholinergic, adrenergic, and histaminergic neurotransmitters, neuropeptides (opioids, galanin, melatonin, neuropeptide Y, leptin) and other hormones (including glucocorticoids and thyroid hormone) may influence the secretion of GH. These effects usually occur indirectly through modulating the release of GHRH and/or SRIF [7].

2. Hypothalamic regulators of GH secretion

GHRH is produced and released into portal vasculature by GHRH neurons. These neurons are located within the arcuate (ARC) nucleus of the hypothalamus. Following binding to the GHRH-receptor (GHRH-R), a Gs-coupled receptor [5], GHRH stimulates adenyl cyclase to generate cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) leading to increased activity of protein kinase A (PKA) [8]. The rise in PKA activity leads to phosphorylation of cAMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB), which acts with pituitary specific growth hormone factor-1 to turn on transcription

intracellular pathways. Activation of SSTR leads to the inhibition of adenyl cyclase to suppress cAMP generation and \([Ca^{2+}]_{i}\) [16]. Alternatively, as SSTRs are coupled to \(Ca^{2+}\) channels, binding of the SSTR results in the direct inhibition of \(Ca^{2+}\) channels. Consequently, this decreases \(Ca^{2+}\) entry into the cell resulting in a reduction in \([Ca^{2+}]_{i}\), and thus a further cessation of GH release [17]. It should be noted, however, that a number of SSTR subtypes exist, and that activation of these receptors may elicit differential effects. All five known SSTRs (SSTR1–SSTR5) are expressed in the CNS, hypothalamus, and the pituitary gland. Of particular importance regarding GH secretion is the abundant expression of SSTR2 and SSTR5, and low expression of SSTR4 in the anterior pituitary gland [18]. Binding of SSTR2 and SSTR5 modulates GHRH-stimulated GH release from rat pituitary cells by potently inhibiting GHRH-stimulated GH release [19]. SSTR2 and SSTR4 are the main receptors responsible for the stimulation of the voltage-gated \(K^{+}\)current, and SSTR2 is the main receptor for the inhibition of voltage-gated \(Ca^{2+}\) current [21,22]. Interestingly, low levels of SRIF stimulate GH secretion, an effect that occurs independent of a rise in \([Ca^{2+}]_{i}\) [23]. Consequently, the role of SRIF in modulating GH secretion may depend on physiological context. Irrespective of this, current consensus is that SRIF predominantly inhibits GH secretion, and that this occurs directly through joint effects on both ion channels and second messenger system. \(Na^{+}\)and \(K^{+}\)channels may also be involved in the control of GH secretion by SRIF. As these channels modify the function of VGCCs by modulating membrane potential and action potential, \(Na^{+}\)and \(K^{+}\)channels may indirectly impact GH release by altering \([Ca^{2+}]_{i}\) [17]. Specifically, it was found that SRIF may increase the \(K^{+}\)current causing hyperpolarization of the membrane. This results in a reduction of \([Ca^{2+}]_{i}\) [22]. Given that the rise in \([Ca^{2+}]_{i}\) is essential to trigger the release of GH, SRIF-induced suppression of \([Ca^{2+}]_{i}\) finally leads to the inhibition of GH secretion [24].

## 3. Peripheral regulators of GH secretion

### 3.1. Insulin-like growth factor-1

GH exerts its physiological effects both directly or indirectly through stimulation of synthesis and secretion of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), as IGF-1 mediates protein synthesis, skeletal muscle growth, and linear growth [25]. This insulin-like protein is primarily produced within the liver in response to GH stimulation, where it is released into circulation. GH and IGF-1 inhibit GH release in a typical feedback relationship at several levels, either directly or indirectly at the level of the pituitary gland to inhibit GHRH-induced GH secretion or by stimulating hypothalamic SRIF and/or inhibiting GHRH release [26–28]. Specifics regarding the mechanisms by which IGF-1 inhibits somatotroph activity remain poorly defined. Within the pituitary gland, IGF-1 inhibits GH gene transcription [29] and GH secretion [28,30], and thus it is likely that IGF-1 may directly modulate GH secretion and production via \(Ca^{2+}\)-dependent mechanisms. Given the extraordinary complexity of IGF-1 signaling pathways, and current lack of electrophysiological evidence defining the role of IGF-1 in regulating GH secretion from the somatotroph, future observations are needed before this can be confirmed.

### 3.2. GH secretagogues and ghrelin

In addition to GHRH and SRIF, the secretion of GH is modulated via a number of GH secretagogues (GHSs) [31,32]. These secretagogues are synthetic compounds that are potent stimulators of GH release, and act via a specific G-protein-coupled receptor, the GHS-receptor (GHS-R) [33,34]. Given that GHSs are a group of artificial compounds, it was initially postulated that an endogenous ligand(s)

might exist to account for the potent stimulatory effects of these secretagogues [35]. It was not until 1999 that the endogenous GHS ghrelin was identified. While investigators at the time focused primarily on the hypothalamus and brain as a potential site for release of this endogenous compound, Kojima et al. were surprised to find that the predominant site for ghrelin release was the stomach [36]. As with other synthetic GHS, stomach-derived ghrelin stimulates GHS-R to increase \([Ca^{2+}]_{i}\) and GH secretion [36].

Since its initial discovery, additional sites of ghrelin production have been confirmed. These include peripheral organs such as the bowel, pancreas, kidney, and placenta as well as central structures including the hypothalamus and pituitary gland [36–40]. Of particular relevance to the secretion of GH was the detection of ghrelin immunoreactive fibers and ghrelin mRNA within the ARC [41]. The existence of ghrelin within the ARC suggests a potential paracrine role for ghrelin in modulating hypothalamic control of GH secretion. However, discordant studies exist to reject the existence of hypothalamic ghrelin in quantities sufficient to modulate hypothalamic control of food intake or GH secretion. Consequently, paracrine interactions of ghrelin in regulating GH secretion are still under investigation. As these structures produce a fraction of the amount of ghrelin found in circulation, the stomach remains the predominant site of ghrelin production, and consequently, removal of the stomach reduces circulating ghrelin by approximately 80% [38]. Current research efforts are underway to determine whether stomach- or hypothalamic-derived ghrelin is a key determinant in the physiological regulation of endogenous GH secretion. Regardless, the effects of exogenously administered ghrelin on GH secretion are well defined.

Ghrelin stimulates GH secretion by acting directly on somatotrophs [36]. This stimulatory effect is modulated through two main signaling pathways involving inositol phosphate and cAMP [36]. Furthermore, recent observations showed that nitric oxide (NO) inhibition blocks ghrelin-induced GH release, suggesting that activation of the NO synthase/NO route may be essential in modulating ghrelin-induced GH secretion [42]. Ghrelin appears to be a more potent stimulator of GH secretion when compared to the effects of GHRH [43], while co-administration of ghrelin and GHRH has synergistic effects on GH secretion [44]. These observations suggest that ghrelin stimulates GH secretion through distinct signaling mechanisms when compared to GHRH, and that ghrelin may modulate GHRH-induced GH secretion. Interestingly, in vivo observations show a reduction in ghrelin secretion from the stomach following treatment with GH and SRIF [45]. By contrast, treatment with GHRH does not appear to impact ghrelin production [45]. While the physiological implication of this remains unclear, these observations are suggestive of a potential feedback loop between ghrelin and GH.

The ghrelin receptor, or GHS-R, is a typical seven transmembrane G-protein-coupled receptor. Expression of the GHS-R is regulated by GH; its expression is increased in GH-deficient dw/dw dwarf rats, and treatment of these rats with GH decreases ghrelin receptor expression [46]. While observations from GHS-R-deficient transgenic mice clearly illustrate that ghrelin stimulates the release of GH specifically via the GHS-R [47], it came as a surprise that maximal in vitro ghrelin-induced GH release requires the existence of GHRH [48]. Furthermore, it has been suggested that ghrelin may regulate GH secretion by modulating pituitary response to GHRH [49]. Here, ghrelin is thought to increase hypothalamic GHRH secretion [50] and GHRH expression [51]. Given this, it has been proposed that ghrelin works in synergy with GHRH to modulate the secretion of GH. To date, the specific nature of this interaction has been difficult to define. As suggested, ghrelin may act synergistically with GHRH neurons to promote the secretion of GH. Alternatively, ghrelin may inhibit the negative effects of somatostatin on the secretion of GH. Peripherally, the actions

of ghrelin may be mediated via direct or indirect interactions with somatotrophs. By contrast, ghrelin may indirectly modulate GH secretion via centrally produced ghrelin or through signaling pathways that link the brain and gut. The afferent fibers of the vagus nerve represent a major neuroanatomical link joining the hypothalamus and gut [52–54]. Ligation of the vagus nerve (vagotomy) results in a loss of ghrelin-stimulated food intake [55,56] and a reduction in ghrelin-stimulated GH secretion [57]. This suggests that the vagus nerve is a key pathway through which ghrelin mediates hypothalamic regulation of GH secretion. These interactions are currently under intense investigation, as ghrelin may link the production of GH secretion relative to metabolic and dietary demand. The interaction between in vivo regulators of GH secretion is summarized in Fig. 2.

### 4. Ion channels and their involvement in somatotrophs

Calcium influx through VGCC is an event essential to the release of GH from the somatotroph. As voltage-gated channels, the opening probabilities of VGCCs are determined by membrane potential, and hence depend on the activity of other ion channels. These include \(K^+\) and \(Na^+\) channels. Many studies have demonstrated that a number of neuropeptides, especially those from the hypothalamus, exert their regulatory roles on GH secretion through the

![Figure 2](#fig-2)

**Fig. 2.** Regulation of GH secretion by inhibitory SRIF and IGF-1 and stimulatory GHRH and ghrelin. GH is secreted by somatotrophs located in the anterior pituitary gland. The release and synthesis of GH from somatotrophs require coordination between peripheral and central networks. Two hypothalamic hormones, GHRH and SRIF, stimulate and inhibit GH secretion, respectively. In turn, GH stimulates the production of IGF-1 from the liver, which feeds back to the hypothalamus to indirectly inhibit the release of GH. Ghrelin is a 28-amino-acid hormone secreted by oxyntic cells of the stomach and gastrointestinal tract but also the hypothalamus. Ghrelin may regulate the release of GH at various levels. Peripherally, the actions of ghrelin may be mediated via direct interactions with somatotrophs (1). Centrally, ghrelin may act synergistically with GHRH neurons to promote the secretion of GH (2). Alternatively, ghrelin may inhibit the negative effects of somatostatin on the secretion of GH (3). Central effects of ghrelin may occur in response to hypothalamic-produced ghrelin, or may be modulated via circulating ghrelin or via the vagus nerve.

modification of transmembrane ion channels [17,10,58]. The exact roles of the various ion channels in hormone secretion are not fully understood; however, some progress has been made at the single-cell level. These observations mostly depend on electro-physiological methods in conjunction with, for example, molecular biological approaches.

Three main cation channels, conducting Na⁺, Ca²⁺, or K⁺, have been identified in the membranes of somatotrophs. Collectively, these channels determine the somatotroph electrical activity. Studies using patch-clamp and Ca²⁺ imaging techniques have demonstrated that GHRH, SRIF and ghrelin regulate [Ca²⁺]i via modification of Na⁺, Ca²⁺, and K⁺ channel activity. Despite these observations, further investigation is needed before the formulation of a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms by which ion channels are involved in the regulation of GH secretion.

### 4.1. Calcium (Ca²⁺) channels

Calcium channels play a key role in mammalian somatotrophs in all species characterized to date. The most important and extensively studied Ca²⁺ channels are VGCCs. These are highly specific Ca²⁺ conducting channels and are mainly activated by changes in membrane potential toward positive values (depolarization) [59]. Physiologically, opening of VGCCs in response to an appropriate transmembrane voltage change, which may be modulated by hormones, neurotransmitters and drugs, allows Ca²⁺ ions to move down their electrochemical gradient into the cytoplasm and thereby alter the functional state of the cell. The ensuing rise in [Ca²⁺]i transfers a depolarizing charge to excitable cells, and may activate a second messenger signal transduction cascade. This signal leads to exocytosis of vesicles of hormones or neurotransmitters, which are responsible for the operation of multiple physiological functions [60,61].

It has been shown that GHRH-induced GH secretion is a Ca²⁺-regulated process involving VGCC opening and subsequent increases in [Ca²⁺]i. In most somatotrophs, when intracellular Ca²⁺ stores are activated by GHRH, biphasic Ca²⁺ oscillation can be recorded, with an initial sharp increase in [Ca²⁺]i resulting from Ca²⁺ release from reservoirs within the cell. This is followed by a moderate and long-lasting [Ca²⁺]i rise due to the influx of Ca²⁺ through VGCCs [62,63]. Five types of Ca²⁺ channels (long-lasting, L; transient, T; neuronal, N; Purkinje, P/Q; and residual, R) have been identified [64–67]. Characterization of these channels is based on their electrophysiological and pharmacological properties [68–71].

#### 4.1.1. L-type Ca²⁺ channels

The ‘L-type’ VGCC was coined based on its ‘long-lasting’, ‘sustained’, or ‘persistent’ characteristics, and are blocked by 1,4-dihydropyridine (DHP) [72]. L-type VGCC channels are involved in the contraction of heart and most smooth muscle cells, and in the control of transmitter release from endocrine cells and sensory neurons [72]. General characteristics of the L-type current include: (1) rapid activation that requires strong depolarization to around –45 mV for threshold; (2) very quick deactivation following sudden repolarization; and (3) high availability even with relatively depolarized holding potentials [72]. In rat somatotrophs, the L-type current contributes by far to the largest portion of total Ca²⁺ current (60–70%), as was revealed using the specific L-type channel blocker, nifedipine [14]. Current observations from GH₃ somatotrophs confirm that the L-type Ca²⁺ channel is stimulated by GHRH [14] and inhibited by SRIF [21]. Ghrelin-stimulated GH release from isolated rat anterior pituitary cells is achieved through both intracellular Ca²⁺ release and extracellular Ca²⁺ influx, and the L-type voltage-gated Ca²⁺ channel is the major channel responsible for Ca²⁺ influx induced by ghrelin [73]. In contrast, using patch-clamp technique voltage-gated Ca²⁺ current in GH₃ cells was decreased by acute administration of ghrelin [74]. This difference may occur due to differences between species or in response to technical differences. Data to explain these differences are lacking, and thus the action of ghrelin on voltage-gated Ca²⁺ currents still remains unclear.

#### 4.1.2. T-type Ca²⁺ channels

T-type VGCCs, also known as low-voltage activated (LVA) Ca²⁺ channels, open following a small depolarization from relatively negative holding potentials. T-type current characteristics include: (1) activation at relatively weak depolarization; (2) only moderately rapid deactivation following sudden repolarization; and (3) low availability from relatively depolarized holding potentials. Given this, T-type Ca²⁺ currents are ‘transient’ or ‘fast’ currents [72]. In most cells T-type VGCC supports pacemaker activity or Ca²⁺ entry at negative membrane potentials [75,76]. The contribution of T-type current to total Ca²⁺ current in somatotrophs varies across species. In rat somatotrophs, this percentage is much smaller (approximately 20% of total Ca²⁺ current) than that contributed by L-type Ca²⁺ channels [77]. Currently, there is no known pharmacological agent that specifically targets T-type Ca²⁺ channels. Mibefradil and amiloride are T-type channel antagonists with other significant targets [78]. Ni⁺ is somewhat more specific for T-type current, although it may block other types of VGCC at higher concentrations [79]. It was shown that T-type Ca²⁺ current was reduced by ghrelin [74], but increased by GHRH [14] in GH₃ somatotrophs. Interestingly, SRIF reduced T-type current in rat somatotrophs but had no effect on GH₃ cells [21,80].

#### 4.1.3. N-type Ca²⁺ channels

N-type VGCCs are high-voltage activated (HVA) channels and normally open at positive potentials. Compared to L-type VGCCs, N-type VGCCs are insensitive to DHPs and are substantially (although not completely) inactivated at a positive holding potential [81,82]. N-type channels were initially thought to be neuron specific; however, N-type current has been recorded in endocrine cells, including pituitary somatotrophs [21,81]. The inactivation rate in N-type current is more negative and faster than that in L-type current, but more positive and slower than that in the T-type current [72]. A reliable and sensitive blocker, ω-conotoxin, has been employed to define the presence of N-type current, and more specific members of the ω-conotoxin family, such as ω-conotoxin GVIA, have been used to test the presence of N-type current [21,83]. It was shown that N-type current was reduced by SRIF and ghrelin in GH₃ somatotrophs [21,74].

#### 4.1.4. P/Q-type Ca²⁺ channels

P/Q-type VGCCs are activated by relatively high voltages, and are insensitive to either DHP or ω-conotoxin; however, these channels can be inhibited by the spider toxin ω-agatoxin-IVA [84,85]. Pharmacological experiments have shown that P/Q-type channels are crucially involved in rapid neurotransmitter release at many excitatory and inhibitory synapses [86]. P- and Q-type currents share similar features. For example, both types of current can be largely reversed by application of very strong depolarization (after ω-agatoxin-IVA block), and both types can be completely blocked by ω-conotoxin MVIIC (0.5 μM) [85]. The main distinction between P- and Q-type channels lies in their rate of voltage-dependent inactivation. This is very slow for P-type channels, but moderate for Q-type channels. Furthermore, their sensitivity to ω-agatoxin-IVA differs significantly (P-type, IC₅₀ of ~1 nM; Q-type IC₅₀ of ~100 nM) [85]. Pharmacological methods suggest that the contribution of P- and Q-type currents to the total Ca²⁺ current in GH₃ somatotrophs is 22% and 18%, respectively [87]. This has been disputed, as more recent observations were unable to confirm the involvement of P/Q-type current in GH₃ cells altogether [21]. Clearly, further investigation is needed to clarify the actions and

characteristic of P/Q-type Ca²⁺ channels, not only in neurons but also in endocrine cells.

### 4.1.5. R-type Ca²⁺ channels

Residual, R-type VGCCs are insensitive to toxins from the ω-conotoxin or ω-agatoxin families. A recently developed R-type peptide inhibitor, SNX-482, blocks the R-type current [88]; however, this peptide does not block toxin-resistant currents in some neurons, including those from cerebellar granule cells, retinal ganglion cells, or hippocampus pyramidal cells [89]. This suggests that multiple Ca²⁺ current subtypes may comprise the R-type current. Furthermore, the presence of three distinct components of the R-type current, with different sensitivities to SNX-482, has been reported in rat cerebellar granule cells [85]. To date, R-type currents have not been observed in somatotrophs [21].

### 4.1.6. The transient receptor protein (TRP) channels

TRP channels represent a large family of Ca²⁺-conducting cation channels. These were first identified in the retina of Drosophila and it was observed that activation of these channels involve phospholipase C-dependent Ca²⁺ influx [90,91]. TRP channels are widely expressed in the nervous system and in non-excitable cells. Here, TRP-related channels may regulate the primary mode of Ca²⁺ entry [92]. TRP-related channels may play two major roles: (1) allowing Ca²⁺ influx due to activation of these channels by certain G-protein subunits or by depletion of cytosolic Ca²⁺ stores; or (2) acting as a sensor to be activated by a variety of physical stimuli such as stretch, temperature or pH [93]. The involvement and possible function of TRP channels in somatotrophs are still unknown.

Briefly, the importance of VGCCs has been well recognized in GH secretion in somatotrophs. Ca²⁺ channels have been shown to be involved in the depolarizing phase of the action potential, and their opening allows Ca²⁺ ions to flow into the cell, leading to an increase in [Ca²⁺]i, which is directly related to GH secretion [77,89].

### 4.2. Potassium (K⁺) channels

K⁺ is the most abundant intracellular ion, while K⁺ channels are the largest subgroup among ion channels. This subgroup consists of at least 78 pore-forming α-subunits [94], and includes voltage-gated K⁺ channels, Ca²⁺-activated K⁺ channels, inwardly rectifying K⁺ channels, and two pore K⁺ channels (leak K⁺ current) [93]. At least three subtypes of voltage-gated K⁺ current have been characterized within somatotrophs: transient outward (IA), delayed rectifying (IK) and inward rectifying (Kir) K⁺ channels. These subtypes are classified based on their pharmacological, voltage and Ca²⁺ dependency, and kinetic properties [80,95]. The IA K⁺ channel is evoked at membrane potential below –70 mV, with rapid inactivation threshold occurring at around –40 mV. The IA current in

rat somatotrophs is kinetically similar to that observed in bovine somatotrophs, rat lactotrophs, and GH cell lines, including the GH₃ cell [96,97]. Functional studies using 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) to stimulate GH secretion in ovine somatotrophs suggest that IA K⁺ channels may be essential for maintaining the resting membrane potential of a cell, and hence determining [Ca²⁺]i [17]. The IK K⁺ channel has a threshold of around –20 mV, and a slow inactivation rate. Kir channels play an important role in maintaining a negative potential of a cell. Since Kir channels can be activated at close to resting potential, these channels may significantly influence the excitability of the cell.

In addition to voltage-gated K⁺ channels, Ca²⁺-activated K⁺ channels are expressed in rat somatotrophs [98]. Ca²⁺ is an absolute requirement for activation of these channels as they are gated by the change in [Ca²⁺]i and increases K⁺ permeability by increasing the frequency of channel opening [99]. Based on single-channel conductance, three main types of Ca²⁺-activated K⁺ channels exist; BK, SK, and IK channels. BK ('big' conductance) channels are large-conductance (200–400 pA), voltage-sensitive channels that are selectively blocked by iberiotoxin (IbTx) [100] and less selectively by charybdotoxin (ChTx) [101]. Blockade of BK channels within rat somatotrophs increase membrane excitability. This may enhance Ca²⁺ signals and thus may increase the amplitude and prolong the duration of an action potential [102]. SK ('small' conductance) channels have a smaller single-channel conductance (5–15 pA), are voltage insensitive and are potently blocked by the bee toxin apamin [103] and UCL 1848 [104]. IK ('intermediate' conductance) channels have an intermediate conductance (20–80 pA), and are weakly inward rectifying, with gating properties (including calmodulin dependence) resembling SK channels. These channels can be blocked by clotrimazole analogues (e.g. TRAM-34) and ChTx [105]. IK and SK are critically important in vascular endothelial cell function as these channels are abundantly expressed and their activation results in hyperpolarization of the cells [106]. While expressed in neurons [107], expression within the somatotroph varies significantly between different experimental conditions [20], and thus additional work is needed to clarify the involvement of these channels in the regulation of GH release.

Activation of voltage-gated K⁺ conductance and reactivation of the inward rectifier Kir contributes to the recovery of the hyperpolarized membrane potential to the resting potential [108]. Within most cells, a key function of Kir is to bring the membrane potential toward the K⁺ equilibrium potential. Inhibition of Kir currents results in an increased rate of action potential firing and enhances GH secretion [109]. In primary culture rat somatotrophs, SRIF significantly increases Kir current and inhibits spontaneous Ca²⁺ oscillations, suggesting that this K⁺ current contributes to the inhibitory effect of SRIF in these cells [110].

Two-pore K⁺ channels, also known as leak K⁺ channels as they can constitutively open, are distributed throughout the body [111]. The activity of these channels is influenced by an excess of chemical and physical stimuli, and may open following a change in pH, lipid content, mechanical stretch, neurotransmitters content, and activation of G-protein-coupled receptors [112]. Given this, these channels may be involved in many physiological functions including the maintenance of the resting potential, pH regulation, and K⁺ homeostasis [93]. Currently, no direct evidence exists to confirm the expression of two-pore channels in somatotrophs and thus their role in regulating GH secretion remains undefined.

### 4.3. Sodium (Na⁺) channels

In excitable cells, Na⁺ influx is responsible for the initial slow subthreshold depolarization of the plasma membrane. This gives rise to a subsequent and rapid action potential and a transient increase in Na⁺ conductance. Therefore, the Na⁺ homeostasis of a cell is of great importance regarding normal function. Two main families of Na⁺ channels exist: the voltage-gated Na⁺ channels (Nav1.1–1.9) and the epithelial Na⁺ channels (ENaCα, β, γ, and δ). Functionally, these two families are distinct. While voltage-gated Na⁺ channels are found almost exclusively in excitable cells where they are responsible for cell depolarization, epithelial Na⁺ channels are involved in Na⁺ homeostasis within epithelial cells [93].

Voltage-gated Na⁺ channels are dynamic transmembrane protein channels that are responsible for the upstroke of the action potential and action potential propagation in many excitable cells, including neurons, skeletal muscle, and endocrine cells [113]. Nine subtypes of voltage-gated Na⁺ channels (Nav1.1–1.9) have been identified and classified as a single family. These channel subtypes were classed based on their evolutionary relationship [114] and their homologous amino acid sequences [59]. Among the nine mammalian voltage-gated Na⁺ channel isoforms, Nav1.7, Nav1.8, and Nav1.9 are predominantly expressed in the peripheral nervous systems and critically contribute to nociception. Nav1.4 is predominantly expressed in adult skeletal muscle, Nav1.5 in cardiac myocytes, and Nav1.3 in embryonic central neurons. Nav1.1, Nav1.2, and Nav1.6 are predominantly expressed in central neurons [59,115]. Nav1.5, Nav1.8, and Nav1.9 have been identified within the mouse somatotroph [115]. Based on their sensitivity to tetrodotoxin (TTX), voltage-gated Na⁺ channels can be further classified into two main categories: tetrodotoxin-sensitive (TTX-S) channels and TTX-resistant (TTX-R) channels. TTX-S channels are selectively blocked by low, nanomolar concentrations of TTX, while the blockade of TTX-R channels require micromolar concentrations of TTX [116]. Based on this categorization, Nav1.1–1.4 and Nav1.6–1.7 are TTX-S channels, while Nav1.5, Nav1.8, and Nav1.9 may be classified as TTX-R channels [117]. All three types of TTX-R Na⁺ channels are located within the mouse pituitary gland (Fig. 3A) [118]. Furthermore, both TTX-S and TTX-R Na⁺ currents have been observed in mouse somatotrophs. Interestingly Yang et al. found that the TTX-S Na⁺ current is mainly involved in basal GH secretion, and not essential to GHRH-induced GH secretion. By comparison, the TTX-R Na⁺ current is not involved in basal GH secretion, but at least partially involved in the GHRH-stimulated GH secretion (Fig. 3B and C) [118].

Na⁺ channels are responsible for the rising phase of the action potential in rat somatotrophs and the Na⁺ current involved is enhanced by GHRH [119]. An increased in voltage-gated Na⁺ current by GHRH has also been demonstrated in primary cultured human GH-secreting adenoma cells [120]. In rat somatotrophs, the GHRH-induced augmentation of the action current was significantly suppressed by replacing extracellular Na⁺ with mannitol or tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (Tris+) [115]. Since GHRH increases cAMP-induced GH secretion, the depolarization induced

(A) Ethidium bromide-stained 1.4% agarose gel showing cDNA amplified with Nav1.5 (760 bp), Nav1.8 (1181 bp), and Nav1.9 (137 bp) primers from reverse transcribed RNA of GH-green fluorescent protein transgenic mouse pituitary, heart, and DRG. (B) Both TTX and Na⁺-free solution significantly reduced basal GH secretion. GHRH (100 nM) increased GH secretion significantly. This was markedly reduced by TTX (1 μM, TTX + GHRH) and was prevented by excluding Na⁺ from the bathing solution (Na⁺ + GHRH). (C) GH secretion (expressed as % of the appropriate control) in response to GHRH (100 nM) at basal levels, and following cotreatment with TTX and depletion of Na⁺. GHRH significantly increased GH secretion in control solution or in the presence of TTX, but not in Na⁺-free solution (data presented as mean ± SEM, p < 0.05).

by GHRH is likely dependent on both extracellular Ca²⁺ and Na⁺ ions [121]; thus, GHRH may increase Na⁺ conductance via cAMP, which in turn causes the depolarization of somatotrophs and activates voltage-gated Ca²⁺ channels. Ultimately this will promote Ca²⁺ influx and GH secretion. Characteristics of ion channels expressed on somatotrophs are shown in Table 1.

### 4.4. Other ion channels – Cl⁻

Chloride (Cl⁻) is the most abundant physiological permeable anion. Like other ions, Cl⁻ transport is regulated across the

plasma membrane as well as across membranes of intracellular organelles. Cl⁻ channels may modify cell function through a number of cellular and intracellular processes [122, 123]. A number of Cl⁻ ion channel families have been identified. These include voltage-gated Cl⁻ channels, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator channels, extracellular ligand-gated ion channels (i.e., γ-GABA receptor), Ca²⁺-activated Cl⁻ channels, and swelling-activated/volume-regulated anion channels [93]. This classification may be an oversimplification, as many Cl⁻ channels are regulated by more than one mechanism. Therefore, following future studies, the classification of Cl⁻ channels may change to reflect additional physiological properties. Analysis of the nerve terminals of the posterior pituitary revealed that GABA activated an inward current. This varied linearly with the voltage change [124], and additional measures revealed that this current was mediated specifically by the GABAA receptor. Here, opening of Cl⁻ channels by GABA weakly depolarized the nerve terminal membrane and blocked the action potential [124, 125]. The involvement of Cl⁻ channels in modulating the release of GH from the somatotroph is currently undefined.

### 5. Conclusion

The regulation of GH secretion from somatotrophs has been well documented. Numerous in vivo and in vitro studies have focused on the regulation of GH secretion by endogenous and synthetic GH stimulants and inhibitors. These include GHRH, ghrelin, and SRIF. At a single-cell level, \[Ca^{2+}\]i levels have been widely reported to directly trigger GH secretion in somatotrophs. To this extent, an alteration in current flux (via the opening or closing of specific ion channels) may impact the level of \[Ca^{2+}\]i, and consequently impact the secretion of GH. Collectively, these signaling pathways may further ensure the tightly controlled release of GH secretion. Given the importance of Na⁺, Ca²⁺, and K⁺ channels in the control of a cell's excitability, major regulators of GH secretion may act via these channels through different signaling systems, as reviewed in this article. Interactions between receptors for GHRH, ghrelin, and SRIF and the different ion channels located on somatotrophs are illustrated in Fig. 4. Fundamental links between certain types of ion

channels and defined somatotroph function, such as GH synthesis and secretion, are still unclear. Confirmation of potential interactions will require rigorous study using techniques of much higher space- and time-resolution directed toward hormone packaging and exocytosis and activation of intracellular signal molecules. More importantly, while cell lines (including the GH3 cell line) may have served as a valuable model for the somatotroph, it is important to note that observations from these lines are limited. For example, many cell lines do not express GHRH-receptors, the full array of SSTRs or the GHS-receptor. Consequently, it is difficult to define the synergistic role of GH agonists and antagonists within the same system. The routine adoption of targeted approaches using labeled somatotrophs (including the GH-green fluorescent protein mouse) and in vivo measures may finally address this.
