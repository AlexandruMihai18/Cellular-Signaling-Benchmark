We have demonstrated previously that growth hormone (GH) activates focal adhesion kinase (FAK), and this activation results in the tyrosine phosphorylation of two FAK substrates, namely paxillin and tensin. We now show here in Chinese hamster ovary cells stably transfected with rat GH receptor cDNA that human (h) GH induces the formation of a large multiprotein signaling complex centered around another FAK-associated protein, p130<sup>Cas</sup> and the adaptor protein CrkII. hGH stimulates the tyrosine phosphorylation of both p130<sup>Cas</sup> and CrkII, their association, and the association of multiple other tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins to the complex. Both the c-Src and c-Fyn tyrosine kinases are tyrosine phosphorylated and activated by cellular hGH stimulation and form part of the multiprotein signaling complex as does tensin, paxillin, IRS-1, the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, C3G, SHC, Grb-2, and Sos-1. c-Cbl and Nck are also tyrosine-phosphorylated by cellular stimulation with hGH and associate with the p130<sup>Cas</sup>-CrkII complex. c-Jun N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase (JNK/SAPK) is activated in response to hGH in accordance with the formation of the abovementioned signaling complex, and hGH stimulated JNK/SAPK activity is increased in CrkII overexpressing NIH3T3 cells compared with vector transfected NIH3T3 cells. The formation of such a large multiprotein signaling complex by GH, with the resultant activation of multiple downstream effector molecules, may be central to many of the pleiotropic effects of GH.

thought to initiate its biological actions, including induction of a number of RNA species in mammalian tissues by interaction with a specific membrane-bound receptor (2). The GH receptor is phosphorylated upon ligand stimulation presumably by the physical association of the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase JAK2 (3). The JAK kinases are linked to transcriptional regulation and JAK activation results in the phosphorylation, dimerization, and nuclear translocation of latent cytoplasmic STAT transcription factors (4). The activated STAT factors bind to their appropriate DNA-responsive elements to activate gene transcription (4). Other diverse actions of GH include the stimulation of chemotaxis and migration of monocyctic cells (5). Concordantly, we have demonstrated that GH stimulates the re-organization of the actin cytoskeleton in cells with fibroblastic morphology (6) and reported that this re-organization of the actin cytoskeleton requires the activity of PI 3-kinase.

Focal adhesion kinase (p125<sup>FAK</sup>) has been postulated to play a central role in the response of the cell to the extracellular matrix (for review, see Ref. 7) and in cell morphology and motility (for review, see Ref. 8). For example, overexpression of FAK stimulates cell migration (9) and both FAK-deficient endodermal and mesodermal cells migrate slower than their FAK replete counterparts (10, 11). The effect of FAK on the cytoskeleton is presumably mediated by the formation of a p130<sup>Cas</sup> (Crk-associated substrate)-CrkII complex (12) in association with c-Src (for review, see Ref. 13). We have reported recently that GH stimulates the tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK and two of its substrates, paxillin and tensin, and that FAK associates with JAK2 and requires the JAK2 binding site on the GH receptor for its phosphorylation (14). We demonstrate here that hGH also stimulates the tyrosine phosphorylation of both p130<sup>Cas</sup> and CrkII, their association, and the association of multiple other tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins to the complex including the c-Src and c-Fyn protein-tyrosine kinases, Nck, c-Cbl, tensin, paxillin, IRS-1, the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase, SHC, Grb-2, Sos-1, and C3G. Finally we demonstrate that JNK/SAPK is activated in response to hGH in accordance with the formation of the p130<sup>Cas</sup>-CrkII complex (15). The formation of such a large multiprotein signaling complex, with the potential downstream activation of multiple signaling pathways, may be central to many of the pleiotropic effects of GH, including cytoskeletal re-organization, cell migration, chemotaxis, mitogenesis, and/or prevention of apoptosis and gene transcription.

c-Fyn monoclonal antibody, tensin monoclonal antibody, Grb-2 monoclonal antibody, p85 monoclonal antibody, Nck monoclonal antibody, and IRS-1 monoclonal antibody were purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). p130<sup>Cas</sup> polyclonal antiserum, c-Cbl polyclonal antiserum, Nck polyclonal antiserum, c-Src polyclonal antiserum, c-Src monoclonal antibody, c-Fyn polyclonal antibody, C3G polyclonal antiserum, FAK polyclonal antiserum, Sos-1 polyclonal antiserum, and protein A/G plus agarose were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-mouse IgG was obtained from Dako (Århus, Denmark). The enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) kit was purchased from Amersham (Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom). The Src and Fyn kinase assay kits were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). The JNK/SAPK assay kit was purchased from New England Biolabs. Protein G and all other reagents were purchased from Sigma.

**CHO Cell Lines Stably Transfected with GH Receptor cDNAs—** Rat GH receptor cDNAs were cloned into an expression plasmid containing an SV40 enhancer and a human metallothionein IIa promoter. The cDNAs were transfected into CHO-K1 cells using Lipofectin together with the pIPB-1 plasmid, which contains a neomycin resistance gene fused to the thymidine kinase promoter (16). Stable integrants were selected using 1000 μg/ml G418. The complete rat GH receptor cDNA (17) coding for amino acids 1–638 was expressed in CHO4–638 or CHO-A-638 cells (16) and will be referred to as CHO-GHR<sub>1–638</sub>. Both cell clones transfected with the full-length receptor cDNA behaved identically for the experiments described here. NIH3T3 cells stably transfected with CrkII cDNA, and the control vector transfected NIH3T3 cells have been described previously (18).

**Cell Culture—** Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells stably transfected with rat growth hormone receptor were maintained in Ham’s F-12 medium (F-12) plus 10% v/v fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO<sub>2</sub> and 95% air at 37 °C as described previously (16). NIH3T3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium and supplemented as above.

**Cell Stimulation and Immunoprecipitation—** CHO cells were grown to confluence, incubated 16 h in serum-free medium, washed twice in serum-free medium, and stimulated with the indicated dose of hGH for the indicated time periods. Cells were lysed at 4 °C in 1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Triton-100, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM EDTA, 0.2 mM sodium orthovanadate, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 30 min with regular vortexes. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 15 min and the resulting supernatants collected and protein concentration determined. 800 μg of protein was used for each immunoprecipitation. Immunoprecipitations were routinely performed by incubating lysates with 2–4 μg/ml amounts of the respective antibody for 2 h at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes were collected either by incubating with 50 μl of protein G-agarose for 1 h (polyclonal antisera) or by incubating with 5 μg/lysate anti-mouse IgG for 1 h followed by 1-h incubation with protein G-agarose (monoclonal antibodies). Immunoprecipitations were washed three times with ice-cold lysis buffer. The pellet was resuspended in 2 × SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 50 mM Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 2% β-mercaptoethanol, and bromphenol blue, boiled for 10 min, and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was collected and subjected to 8% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes using standard electrophoretic procedures.

**Western Blot Analysis and Densitometry—** Nitrocellulose membranes were blocked with either 3% insulin-free bovine serum albumin (for phosphotyrosine immunoblotting) or 5% non-fat dry milk (for other immunoblotting) in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h at 22 °C. Blots were then immunolabeled overnight at 4 °C with PY20 (1:1000), FAK monoclonal antibody (1:1000), paxillin monoclonal antibody (1:1000), tensin monoclonal antibody (1:250), Nck monoclonal antibody (1:1000), p130<sup>Cas</sup> monoclonal antibody (1:1000), CrkII monoclonal antibody (1:2500), c-Fyn monoclonal antibody (1:250), Grb-2 monoclonal antibody (1:5000), p85 monoclonal antibody (1:1000), IRS-1 monoclonal antibody (1:250), p130<sup>Cas</sup> polyclonal antiserum (1:250), c-Cbl polyclonal antiserum (1:250), Nck polyclonal antiserum (1:250), c-Src polyclonal antiserum (1:250), c-Src monoclonal antibody (1:250), c-Fyn polyclonal antibody (1:250), C3G polyclonal antiserum (1:250), FAK polyclonal antiserum (1:250), and Sos-1 polyclonal antiserum (1:250). Immunolabeling was detected by ECL (Amersham Life Science, Inc.) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The blots were stripped and re-probed with the same antibodies used for their immunoprecipitation to ensure equal loading of the immunoprecipitated protein. Blots were stripped by incubation for 30 min at 50 °C in a solution containing 62.5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, 2% SDS, and 0.7% β-mercaptoethanol. Blots were then washed for 30 min with several changes of phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20 at room temperature. Efficacy of stripping was determined by re-exposure of the membranes to ECL. Thereafter, blots were reblocked and immunolabeled as described above. Densitometry was performed by using the GS-700 imaging densitometer from Bio-Rad according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

**Kinase Assays—** Src and Fyn kinase assays were performed as described according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.). In brief, supernatant containing 150 μg of protein per sample derived from cells stimulated with hGH was incubated with 1 μg of Src polyclonal antibody or 1 μg of Fyn polyclonal antibody at 4 °C overnight in a final volume of 500 μl. Immunocomplexes were collected by incubation with 20 μl of protein A/G plus-agarose for 1 h. Immuno-precipitates were washed three times with ice-cold lysis buffer. 10 μl (150 μM final concentration) of the substrate peptide, 10 μl of Src reaction buffer, and 10 μl of [γ-<sup>32</sup>P]ATP stock were added to a microcentrifuge tube and incubated for 10 min at 30 °C with agitation. 20 μl of 40% trichloroacetic acid was then added to precipitate peptides, and a 25-μl aliquot was transferred onto the center of a numbered P81 paper square. The assay squares were washed three times for 5 min each with 0.75% phosphoric acid and once with acetone. The assay squares were transferred to a scintillation vial, 5 ml of scintillation mixture added, and the level of radioactivity determined in a scintillation counter. JNK/SAPK assays were performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. In brief, CHO-GHR<sub>1–638</sub> cells were serum-deprived for 16 h, treated with 50 nM hGH, and the cells lysed at 4 °C in 1 ml of lysis buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mM glycerol phosphate, 1 mM Na<sub>3</sub>VO<sub>4</sub>, 0.1% phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mg/ml leupeptin) per sample. The lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant containing 200 μg of protein per sample was incubated overnight at 4 °C with 2 μg of N-terminal c-Jun (1–89) fusion protein bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads in a final volume of 500 μl in 1 × lysis buffer. The beads were washed twice with 500 μl of lysis buffer containing 0.1% phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and twice with 500 μl of kinase buffer (25 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mM glycerol phosphate, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1 mM Na<sub>3</sub>VO<sub>4</sub>, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>). The kinase reactions were carried out in the presence of 100 μM ATP at 30 °C for 30 min. c-Jun phosphorylation was selectively detected by Western immunoblotting using a chemiluminescent detection system and specific c-Jun antibodies (1:1000 dilution) recognizing phosphorylation of c-Jun at serine 63.

**Statistics and Presentation of Data—** All experiments were repeated at least three times, usually five to seven times. Figures presented for Western blot analyses are representative of multiple experiments. The text under “Results” summarizes the results from multiple Western blot analyses. Consequently, the text in the results section (e.g. description of the time course of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation) may not exactly correspond to the actual figure presented. All numerical data are expressed as mean ± S.D. Data were analyzed using the two-tailed *t* test or analysis of variance.

**RESULTS**

**hGH Stimulates the Tyrosine Phosphorylation of p130<sup>Cas</sup>—** We have reported previously that hGH stimulation of CHO-GHR<sub>1–638</sub> cells results in the tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK and two of its substrates, namely paxillin and tensin (14). Another protein associated with FAK is p130<sup>Cas</sup>, although it is apparent that p130<sup>Cas</sup> is tyrosine-phosphorylated by Src protein tyrosine kinase family members associated with FAK (19, 20). To determine whether hGH could also stimulate the tyrosine phosphorylation of p130<sup>Cas</sup>, we first treated CHO-GHR<sub>1–638</sub> cells for 0–60 min with 50 nM hGH, prepared cell extracts, and immunoprecipitated tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins with PY20. SDS-PAGE and subsequent Western blotting for p130<sup>Cas</sup> revealed a hGH- and time-dependent increase in the level of p130<sup>Cas</sup> protein in the phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1A). p130<sup>Cas</sup> protein was identified as a single band of 130 kDa. Some basal level of p130<sup>Cas</sup> tyrosine phosphorylation was observed in serum-deprived cells. hGH-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of p130<sup>Cas</sup> was first observed 2 min after stimulation. The maximal hGH-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of p130<sup>Cas</sup> was observed between 5 and 30 min after stimulation, with the relative level of p130<sup>Cas</sup> tyrosine

FIG. 1. hGH stimulation of tyrosine phosphorylation of p130Cas, CrkII, c-Src, c-Fyn, c-Cbl, and Nck in CHO cells stably transfected with GH receptor cDNA (CHO-GHR<sub>1-638</sub>). CHO-GHR<sub>1-638</sub> cells were stimulated with 50 nM hGH for the indicated time periods, cell extracts prepared, and tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins precipitated with PY20 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis for either p130Cas (A), CrkII (B), c-Src (C), c-Fyn (D), c-Cbl (E), or Nck (F). The position of the molecular mass standards is indicated on the right-hand side. The data presented are representative of at least three separate experiments.

phosphorylation decreasing at 60 min. We next immunoprecipitated p130Cas from cell extracts of CHO-GHR<sub>1-638</sub> cells and examined the level of tyrosine phosphorylation by Western blot analysis with PY20. We observed the consistent presence of a time- and hGH-dependent tyrosine-phosphorylated band of 130 kDa, which co-migrated with p130Cas protein (Fig. 2A). Increased hGH-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of p130 was observed first at 2 min, persisted to 30 min, and then declined at 60 min. p130Cas has been reported to associate with FAK in a Src-dependent manner (for review, see Ref. 13). Other hGH-dependent tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were also observed in the p130Cas immunoprecipitates and will be discussed below. However, one of these hGH-dependent tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins possessed a molecular mass of 125 kDa. We therefore proceeded to determine the effect of cellular stimulation with hGH on the association state between p130Cas and p125FAK. Immunoprecipitation of p130Cas from cell extracts and Western blot analysis for FAK revealed a time- and

hGH-dependent association of FAK with p130Cas (Fig. 2C). Constitutive association between FAK and p130Cas was observed, and hGH stimulation of cells resulted in increased p130Cas-FAK association observed first at 2 min, maximal between 5–30 min, and then followed by a decline to 60 min. Thus hGH stimulated the formation of a FAK-p130Cas complex. p130Cas has also been reported to associate with the adaptor protein CrkII (19). Immunoprecipitation of CrkII from cell extracts and subsequent Western blot analysis for p130Cas revealed a time- and hGH-dependent association of p130Cas with CrkII (Fig. 2E). hGH stimulation of cells resulted in increased p130Cas-CrkII association between 2 and 30 min and followed by a decline at 60 min.

The loading control for p130Cas is shown in D. The arrowhead marks the position of p125FAK detected at 125 kDa.

The loading control for CrkII is shown in F. The arrowhead marks the position of p130Cas detected at 130 kDa. The position of the molecular mass standards is indicated on the right-hand side. The data presented are representative of at least three separate experiments.

GH Signaling Complex

CrkII, we examined the level of CrkII protein in the phosphotyrosine (PY20) immunoprecipitates from extracts of cells treated with hGH (Fig. 1B). CrkII protein was identified as a doublet band of 40 and 42 kDa concordant with previous reports demonstrating the existence of 40- and 42-kDa CrkII (22); the 42-kDa CrkII being a phosphorylated form of CrkII with subsequent slower electrophoretic migration (23). Some basal level of CrkII tyrosine phosphorylation was observed in serum deprived cells. hGH-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of CrkII was first observed 2 min after stimulation. The 42-kDa CrkII was the major tyrosine-phosphorylated CrkII species following hGH stimulation. The maximal hGH-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of CrkII was observed between 2 and 30 min after stimulation, with the relative level of CrkII tyrosine phosphorylation decreasing at 60 min. From the above results it is apparent that CrkII is a component of a larger signaling complex. We therefore immunoprecipitated CrkII from cell extracts of CHO-GHR<sub>1–638</sub> cells stimulated for 0–60 min with 50 nM hGH and examined the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of CrkII and CrkII-associated proteins by Western blot analysis with PY20 (Fig. 3A). We observed the consistent presence of major time- and hGH-dependent tyrosine-phosphorylated bands of 130, 125, 120, 85 (not obvious on blot presented), 68, 62, 60, 47, and 42 kDa. The tyrosine-phosphorylated band at 42 kDa co-migrated with the 42-kDa CrkII protein. The other hGH-dependent tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins associated with CrkII have been identified below. Other tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were obscured by the presence of the IgG heavy chains. Also, when conditions of separation and transfer were optimized, larger molecular mass proteins at 180 and 215 kDa associated with CrkII were also observed to be tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to cellular stimulation with hGH (identified below as IRS-1 and tensin, respectively). Increased hGH-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of CrkII and CrkII-associated proteins was generally observed first at 2 min, persisted to 30 min, and then declined at 60 min. We also proceeded to determine the effect of cellular stimulation with hGH on the association state between CrkII and FAK. Immunoprecipitation of CrkII from cell extracts and Western blot analysis for FAK revealed a time- and hGH-dependent association of FAK with CrkII (Fig. 3C). hGH stimulation of cells resulted in increased FAK-CrkII association observed first at 2 min, maximal between 2 and 30 min, and then followed by a decline at 60 min. We also performed the reciprocal experiment with immunoprecipitation of FAK protein and immunoblotting for the presence of CrkII protein. This experiment depicted in Fig. 3E also similarly demonstrated the hGH dependence of the FAK-CrkII association. Thus hGH stimulated the formation of a FAK-p130<sup>Cas</sup>-CrkII complex of signal-transducing proteins.

**hGH Stimulates c-Src Kinase Activity—c-Src has been reported to associate with FAK and is responsible for full tyrosine phosphorylation of the FAK molecule as well as serving as an adaptor molecule for the association of FAK and p130Cas (for review, see Ref. 13). We also observed above the presence of a hGH-dependent tyrosine-phosphorylated protein of 60 kDa associated with the CrkII-p130<sup>Cas</sup> complex. To determine whether hGH could also stimulate the tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Src, we immunoprecipitated tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins from cell extracts with PY20 and observed by Western blot analysis for c-Src, a hGH-and time-dependent increase in the level of c-Src protein in the phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1C). c-Src protein was identified as a single band of 60 kDa. c-Src was basally tyrosine-phosphorylated in serum-deprived cells. hGH-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Src was first observed 2 min after stimulation. The maximal hGH-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Src was ob-**

Paxillin, Tensin, IRS-1, and PI 3-Kinase Are Present in the GH-stimulated p130<sup>Cas</sup>-CrkII Complex—We have reported previously that hGH stimulates the tyrosine phosphorylation and association of tensin with FAK (14). We therefore proceeded to determine whether tensin was present in the CrkII-p130<sup>Cas</sup> complex formed by cellular stimulation with hGH. Immunoprecipitation of CrkII from cell extracts and subsequent Western blot analysis for tensin revealed a time- and hGH-dependent association of tensin with the CrkII-p130<sup>Cas</sup> complex (Fig. 6A). Tensin was minimally associated with the CrkII-p130<sup>Cas</sup> complex in the unstimulated state, and maximal hGH-dependent association of tensin with the CrkII-p130<sup>Cas</sup> complex was observed at 5–30 min followed by a decline at 60 min. We have also reported previously that hGH stimulates the tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin constitutively associated with FAK (14). Since FAK is a component of the CrkII-p130<sup>Cas</sup> complex, we therefore proceeded to determine whether paxillin was present in the CrkII-p130<sup>Cas</sup> complex formed by cellular stimulation with hGH. CrkII immunoprecipitates subjected to Western blot analysis for paxillin revealed a time- and hGH-

dependent association of paxillin with the CrkII-p130<sup>Cas</sup> complex. Paxillin was minimally associated with the CrkII-p130<sup>Cas</sup> complex in the unstimulated state (visible upon longer exposure of the membrane) and maximal hGH-dependent association of paxillin with the CrkII-p130<sup>Cas</sup> complex was observed at 5–30 min (Fig. 6C) followed by a decline at 60 min. CrkII has also been reported to associate with other molecules, including IRS-1 (23), and IRS-1 has been reported previously to be phosphorylated in response to cellular stimulation with GH (27–29). We therefore examined the association state between IRS-1 and CrkII (Fig. 6E) and demonstrated a time- and hGH-dependent association of IRS-1 with CrkII. IRS-1 was not associated with CrkII in the unstimulated state (or minimal association upon longer exposure of the membrane) and maximal hGH-dependent association of IRS-1 with CrkII was observed at 15 min followed by a decline at 30 and 60 min (Fig. 6F). The p85 regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase has been reported to associate directly with many of the components of the hGH-stimulated CrkII-p130<sup>Cas</sup> complex described herein. These include FAK (30), tensin (20), c-Cbl (31) (see below), and IRS-1 (19). We thus reasoned that p85 should be contained in the CrkII-p130<sup>Cas</sup> complex formed by cellular stimulation with hGH. We observed a time- and hGH-dependent association of p85 with the CrkII-p130<sup>Cas</sup> complex (Fig. 6G). Thus p85 was minimally associated with the CrkII-p130<sup>Cas</sup> complex in the unstimulated state, and maximal hGH-dependent association of p85 with the CrkII-p130<sup>Cas</sup> complex was observed at 2–5 min followed by a decline to 60 min.

c-Cbl Is Tyrosine-phosphorylated in Response to hGH and Complexes with p130<sup>Cas</sup>-CrkII—c-Cbl has been reported to associate with some of the above mentioned proteins (e.g. c-Src, c-Fyn) (32, 33), and we have observed the presence of a hGH-dependent tyrosine-phosphorylated protein of 120 kDa associated with CrkII. Stimulation of CHO-GHR<sub>1–638</sub> cells with hGH resulted in a time-dependent increase in the level of c-Cbl protein in the phosphotyrosine (PY20) immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1E). c-Cbl protein was identified as a single band of 120 kDa, and some basal level of c-Cbl tyrosine phosphorylation was observed in serum-deprived cells. The maximal hGH-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl was observed between 5 and 15 min after stimulation, with the relative level of c-Cbl tyrosine phosphorylation decreasing at 60 min. We also performed the reciprocal immunoprecipitation for c-Cbl protein and examined the level of tyrosine phosphorylation by Western blot analysis with PY20. We observed a time- and hGH-dependent tyrosine-phosphorylated band of 120 kDa, which co-migrated with c-Cbl protein (Fig. 7A). Similarly, increased hGH-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of p120 was observed first at 2 min, was maximal 5–15 min after stimulation, and then declined at 60 min. We also proceeded to determine the association state between c-Cbl and CrkII by immunoprecipitation of CrkII from extracts of cells treated with hGH and subsequent Western blot analysis for c-Cbl (Fig. 7C). c-Cbl was not associated with CrkII in the unstimulated state (or minimally associated upon longer exposure of membrane) and maximal hGH-dependent association of c-Cbl with CrkII was observed at 2–15 min. c-Cbl has been reported to associate with and be phosphorylated by the c-Src and c-Fyn kinases (32, 33). Immunoprecipitation of c-Cbl from cell extracts and Western blot analysis for c-Src revealed a time-and hGH-dependent association of c-Src with c-Cbl (Fig. 7E). Some basal level of c-Src was associated with c-Cbl in the unstimulated state, and maximal hGH-dependent association of c-Src with c-Cbl was observed between 2 and 15 min with a decline at 30 and 60 min. Similarly, upon stripping and reprobing of the same membrane, we observed a time- and hGH-dependent association of c-Fyn with

Nck Is Tyrosine-phosphorylated in Response to hGH and Complexes with p130<sup>Cas</sup>-CrkII—Nck has been reported previously to associate with p130<sup>Cas</sup> (20) and mediate the downstream activation of JNK/SAPK (34, 35). To determine whether hGH could stimulate the tyrosine phosphorylation of Nck, we examined the level of Nck protein in phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates from hGH-treated cells (Fig. 1F). Nck protein was identified as a single band of 47 kDa. Some basal level of Nck tyrosine phosphorylation was observed in serum-deprived cells. The maximal hGH-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of Nck was observed between 2 and 15 min after stimulation, with the relative level of Nck tyrosine phosphorylation decreasing at 60 min. Immunoprecipitation of Nck protein from cell extracts and Western blot analysis with PY20 revealed the consistent presence of a major time- and hGH-dependent tyrosine-phosphorylated band of 47 kDa, which co-migrated with Nck protein (Fig. 8A). Similarly, increased hGH-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of p47 was observed first at 2 min, was maximal 5–15 after stimulation, and then declined at 60 min. We next proceeded to determine the association state between Nck and p130<sup>Cas</sup>-CrkII complex. Immunoprecipitation of CrkII protein from cell extracts treated with hGH and Western blotting analysis for Nck revealed a time- and hGH-dependent association of Nck with CrkII (Fig. 8C). Some basal level of Nck was associated with CrkII in the unstimulated state, and maximal hGH-dependent association of Nck with CrkII was observed between 2 and 30 min (Fig. 5C).

CrkII complex. SHC proteins of molecular masses 52 and 66 kDa were associated in a hGH-dependent manner with the p130<sup>Cas</sup>-CrkII complex (Fig. 9E). SHC proteins were associated with CrkII in the unstimulated state, and maximal hGH-dependent association of SHC proteins with CrkII was observed at 2–15 min followed by a decline to 60 min. The formation of a FAK-c-Src complex permits c-Src to phosphorylate FAK at tyrosine 925, thereby promoting Grb-2 binding (37). Grb-2 has also been demonstrated to be utilized by GH to mediate downstream signaling to MAP kinase via its association with SHC (38, 39). We therefore examined the effect of hGH on the association between Grb-2 and the p130<sup>Cas</sup>-CrkII complex. Immunoprecipitation of CrkII from the cell extracts and Western blot analysis for Grb-2 revealed a time- and hGH-dependent association of Grb-2 with CrkII (Fig. 9G). Grb-2 was associated with CrkII in the unstimulated state, and maximal hGH-dependent association of Grb-2 with CrkII was observed at 5–15 min followed by a decline to 60 min. We also examined the effect of hGH on the association between Sos-1 and the p130<sup>Cas</sup>-CrkII complex. CrkII was immunoprecipitated from cell extracts, and Western blot analysis of these precipitates for Sos-1 revealed a time-and hGH-dependent association of Sos-1 with CrkII (Fig. 9I). Thus, Sos-1 was associated with CrkII in the unstimulated state, and maximal hGH-dependent association of Sos-1 with CrkII was observed at 5 min followed by dissociation at 15–60 min to below the unstimulated state.

**hGH Stimulates JNK/SAPK Activity—** Since the hGH-induced CrkII-p130<sup>Cas</sup> complex contained two proteins (Nck and C3G) upstream of JNK/SAPK (15, 35), we reasoned that hGH should also be able to enhance JNK/SAPK activity. We therefore examined the JNK/SAPK activity in the cell after hGH stimulation using a specific assay. Cells were therefore cultured to confluence, stimulated with hGH, and JNK/SAPK kinase activity measured. hGH stimulation of CHO-GHR<sub>1–638</sub> cells resulted in increased JNK/SAPK kinase activity, maximal at 15 min and followed by a decline to 60 min (Fig. 10). Therefore one possible downstream target of the CrkII-p130<sup>Cas</sup> complex formed by cellular stimulation with hGH is JNK/SAPK.

**hGH Stimulation of JNK/SAPK Activity Is CrkII-dependent—** To determine whether CrkII actually participated in the hGH activation of JNK/SAPK, we utilized NIH3T3 cells stably transfected with either the vector or CrkII cDNA (40). The NIH3T3 cells stably transfected with CrkII cDNA overexpressed CrkII compared with the vector-transfected control cells (40). Both cell lines possessed similar levels of <sup>125</sup>I-hGH binding at the cell surface (data not shown) and were therefore suitable to study the role of CrkII in the hGH stimulation of JNK/SAPK activity. The vector-transfected NIH3T3 cells displayed minimal activation of JNK/SAPK activity in response to 50 nM hGH. In contrast, the NIH3T3 cells overexpressing CrkII exhibited marked increases in JNK/SAPK activity in response to 50 nM hGH (Fig. 11). Thus CrkII is a positive intermediary in the GH signal transduction pathway leading to JNK/SAPK activation.

DISCUSSION

In the present study we have demonstrated that hGH induces the formation of a large multiprotein signaling complex involving proteins that have been previously identified to be activated by GH (FAK, paxillin, tensin (14), IRS-1 (27–29), SHC (38), Grb-2, Sos-1 (39), and p85 (41)) as well as the proteins newly identified to be involved in GH signal transduction (p130<sup>Cas</sup>, Crk-II, c-Src, c-Fyn, c-Cbl, Nck, C3G). Such a large multiprotein signaling complex may also be utilized by other members of the cytokine receptor superfamily to mediate their pleiotropic effects within the cell. Other members of the cytokine receptor superfamily include the receptors for prolactin

The related hormone, PRL, for example, has been reported previously to activate FAK (42), c-Src (43), c-Fyn (44), c-Cbl (45), and p85 (46), and it is likely that the PRL activation of these molecules also includes the formation of the large multiprotein signaling complex centered around p130<sup>Cas</sup>-Crk-II. The utilization of similar signaling molecules by members of the cytokine receptor superfamily would explain the enormous redundancy in biological function observed between these molecules (47). Interestingly, though, the hGH-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of Crk-II and its association with IRS-1 identifies a potential divergence point for signal transduction by hGH and its somatic mediator, IGF-1. According to the somatomedin hypothesis, GH mediates many of its somatic effects by the production of circulating IGF-1, which acts locally in target tissues (3). IGF-1 has been reported to stimulate the tyrosine phosphorylation of Crk-II and subsequent dissociation from IRS-1 (40). We demonstrate here that hGH stimulates the tyrosine phosphorylation and association of Crk-II with IRS-1. How this difference in signal transduction by GH and IGF-1 affects the final response of the cell to stimulation is under investigation.<sup>2</sup>

we have described in the GH-stimulated signaling complex have been reported to be substrates for c-Src. These include FAK, p130Cas (13), and c-Cbl (32). The formation of a FAK-c-Src complex permits c-Src to phosphorylate FAK within the catalytic domain (47) and at tyrosine 925 (48) thus enhancing FAK kinase activity and promoting Grb-2 binding, respectively. The binding of Src family protein tyrosine kinases to the motif surrounding the FAK autophosphorylation site (tyrosine 397) is required for Src-mediated phosphorylation of FAK tyrosine 925 in vivo (48). Overexpression of the c-Src binding site mutant of FAK (Phe-397) inhibits fibronectin-stimulated signaling to MAPK, implying that Src family protein tyrosine kinase binding may be essential for FAK-mediated signaling events (20). Thus one potential pathway for the activation of MAPK by GH is through a FAK-c-Src-Grb-2 complex. FAK can also bind and directly phosphorylate SHC at tyrosine 317 to promote Grb-2 binding and activation of MAPK (49). It has also been demonstrated previously that in addition to the classical MAPK pathway (39), GH utilizes the Grb-2 binding site on the epidermal growth factor receptor in a JAK2 (but not Src)-dependent manner to mediate the downstream activation of MAPK (25). Thus multiple pathways may be utilized by GH to mediate MAPK activation in a manner analogous to integrin signal transduction (49).

In FAK-deficient fibroblasts, p130Cas is tyrosine-phosphorylated (50) and localized to cell substratum contact sites (51). In Src-deficient fibroblasts p130Cas is neither tyrosine-phosphorylated (20, 50) nor localized to focal adhesions (51) after integrin stimulation. Thus it appears that c-Src tyrosine-phosphorylates p130Cas and localizes p130Cas to focal adhesions after integrin stimulation. Also it has been demonstrated that both the SH2 and SH3 domains of c-Src bind to specific motifs in p130Cas (52). Furthermore, it has been postulated that c-Src bound through its SH2 domain to phosphorylated FAK facilitates c-Src SH3 domain interactions with p130Cas thereby promoting the formation of a ternary complex of FAK, c-Src, and p130Cas (13). It remains to be determined which kinase (FAK, c-Src, JAK2, or other), or which combination of kinases, are utilized by GH to mediate the tyrosine phosphorylation of p130Cas.

The molecules involved in the p130Cas-Crk-II complex are likely to be pivotal for many of the pleiotropic effects of GH on cellular function. We have shown here that hGH can stimulate an increase in JNK/SAPK activity concordant with our demonstration that hGH stimulation of the cell results in the tyrosine phosphorylation of Nck and inclusion of both C3G and Nck in the p130Cas-CrkII complex. Integrin stimulation has also been demonstrated previously to promote the binding of Nck to p130Cas (20). Both C3G and Nck have been reported to be upstream of JNK/SAPK (15, 35). A CrkII-C3G complex has been demonstrated to activate JNK/SAPK through a pathway involving the mixed lineage kinase family of proteins (53). Nck connects to the JNK/SAPK pathway by association with SH3 domain-associated protein serine/threonine kinases such as PAK or NIK (34, 35). Evidence presented here also indicates that this is the case for hGH, as CrkII overexpression (upstream of C3G (15)) in NIH3T3 cells results in the enhanced hGH-dependent activation of JNK/SAPK activity. The activa-

tion of JNK/SAPK by hGH also provides another pathway by which GH may affect cellular function. JNK/SAPK is involved in many cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation and apoptosis (54), and it is likely that hGH utilizes JNK/SAPK for some of these purposes. We have also reported previously that hGH induces the re-organization of the cellular actin cytoskeleton, including the transient disassembly and reassembly of actin stress fibers and the formation of focal filamentous actin-containing complexes (membrane ruffles) (6)). In this regard, it is interesting that hGH stimulates the formation of the p130<sup>Cas</sup>-CrkII complex as the formation of this complex has been demonstrated to be sufficient for cell migration (12). The hGH-dependent reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton is PI 3-kinase-dependent (6), and we have demonstrated that the regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase is found in the p130<sup>Cas</sup>-Crk-II complex after hGH stimulation. CrkII overexpression in fibroblasts has also been demonstrated to enhance p130<sup>Cas</sup> phosphorylation and Rac-dependent cell migration (12). Preliminary data also indicate that Crk-II overexpression in NIH3T3 cells enhances the hGH-dependent translocation of PI 3-kinase to membrane ruffles and the subsequent formation of membrane ruffles in these cells.<sup>2</sup> Furthermore the *Drosophila* Nck homolog, DOCK, is involved in cell migration events (55). Whether the formation of the p130<sup>Cas</sup>-CrkII complex is involved in other GH-stimulated events within the cell, such as STAT-mediated transcriptional activation and mitogenesis, remain to be determined. Evidence from other systems however suggest that this may be the case. c-Cbl has been postulated to regulate the activity of c-Fyn in response to insulin (56), and PRL has been reported to stimulate the formation of a c-Cbl-PI 3-kinase complex with a resultant increase in the c-Cbl-associated PI 3-kinase activity (45). Interestingly, antisense repression of c-Cbl expression enhances the autophosphorylation of the EGF receptor and EGF activation of the JAK-STAT but not the Ras pathway (57), whereas c-Cbl has been reported to be a negative regulator of other kinases such as Syk (58) and ZAP-70 (59). Also the novel c-Cbl-associated protein (CAP) has been demonstrated to be involved in the formation of stress fibers and focal adhesion complexes (60). The role of c-Cbl in GH signal transduction is currently under investigation.

It is likely that other proteins, apart from those we have described here, are also involved in the p130<sup>Cas</sup>-Crk-II complex stimulated by hGH presumably in a cell type-specific manner. Many of the proteins we have described here in the GH-stimulated p130<sup>Cas</sup>-Crk complex themselves interact directly with other proteins or are found in a complex with other proteins. One such example is c-Cbl. Other proteins that have been reported to be associated in a complex with c-Cbl include Bruton's tyrosine kinase (61), c-Cbl-associated protein (60), Vav (62), SHIP (63), SHP-2 (64), JAK2,<sup>3</sup> Syk protein tyrosine kinase (58), ZAP-70 tyrosine kinase (59), Crk-L (65), Sam68, JAK3, and phospholipase C γ1 (66), Tyk-2 (67), 14-3-3 protein isoforms, cytokeratin 18, human unconventional myosin IC, and SH3 P17 (68). Whether GH utilizes all of these signaling molecules as well, in what cell type, and in what combination remains to be determined. GH has been reported to stimulate the tyrosine phosphorylation of SHP-2 (69, 70), JAK2, and JAK3 (71), and therefore it is likely that these proteins are also included in the p130<sup>Cas</sup>-Crk-II complex. We have for example demonstrated that Sam68 is also detectable in the GH-stimulated p130<sup>Cas</sup>-Crk-II complex.<sup>4</sup> Another possibility is that hGH may stimulate the formation of several distinct Crk-II signal-

ing complexes containing different components dependent on cell type and differentiation status.

In conclusion we have demonstrated that hGH stimulates the formation of a multiprotein signaling complex centered around p130<sup>Cas</sup> and CrkII with the resultant activation of JNK/SAPK activity. The formation of such a large multiprotein signaling complex by GH, with the resultant activation of multiple downstream effector molecules, may be central to many of the pleiotropic effects of GH.
