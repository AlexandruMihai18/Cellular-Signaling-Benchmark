ABSTRACT

TNF is a multifunctional cytokine that plays a key role in innate immunity by inducing the expression of a variety of genes that are involved in an inflammatory response. TNF-induced NF-κB activation is one of the best studied signaling pathways in mammalian cells and has recently led to a revival of research in the biology of ubiquitin. Many NF-κB signaling proteins are modified by specific ubiquitin ligases with different types of ubiquitin chains that are recognized by other proteins and which determine the outcome of ubiquitination. In addition, specific de-ubiquitinases make the whole process reversible. This review summarizes recent findings that have shaped our current understanding on the role of cytoplasmic ubiquitination events in the regulation of TNF-induced NF-κB signaling.

1. Introduction: TNF, a multifunctional cytokine

36 years ago, TNF was discovered as an endotoxin-induced serum factor that caused lysis of tumor cells, and was therefore named “tumor necrosis factor” [1]. In the following years, TNF was mainly studied for its anti-cancer properties [2,3]. These studies revealed that, in addition to its tumor regression capacities, TNF also has toxic side effects [4]. Therefore, TNF as anti-cancer therapy was largely abandoned except for isolated limb perfusion, where tumor regression in the affected limb can be achieved by injecting high amounts of TNF mainly in combination with IFNγ, hyperthermia and chemotherapeutics, without systemic side effects [5]. A decade after its discovery, Cerami and co-workers isolated TNF as a cachexia inducing molecule that is secreted from endotoxin-treated macrophages and which was therefore originally called cachectin [6,7]. With this finding, TNF was disclosed as a crucial mediator of sepsis and anti-TNF monoclonal antibodies were found to prevent septic shock during lethal bacteremia in mice [8]. In parallel, TNF was identified as a key cytokine in the pathophysiology of rheumatoid arthritis and anti-TNF monoclonal antibodies were found to protect in a murine model of rheumatoid arthritis [9] and most importantly in human patients [10]. The monoclonal anti-TNF antibodies infliximab and adalimumab and the soluble TNF receptor etanercept are the first marketed drugs that have now been successfully used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. In addition, the currently marketed TNF blockers are highly effective in ankylosing spondylitis, psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, and inflammatory bowel disease [11], illustrating the important role of TNF in chronic inflammation.

Different immune cells, mainly macrophages and lymphocytes, produce TNF, which is expressed as a type II transmembrane precursor protein that is cleaved by the metalloproteinase TNF alpha converting enzyme (TACE) to its mature secreted form [12,13]. Both soluble and membrane-bound TNF have biological activity. The large scope of TNF activities can be explained by the presence of TNF receptors (TNF-R) on nearly every cell type, except for unstimulated lymphocytes and erythrocytes. TNF can be recognized by two distinct receptor types, TNF-RI (also referred to as TNF-R1, TNFRSF1A, p55, p60 or CD120a) and TNF-RII (TNF-R2, TNFRSF1B, p75, p80 or CD120b) [14,15]. In vivo, TNF-RI mediates most TNF activities, although TNF-RII has been suggested to preferentially mediate the effect of membrane-bound TNF [16]. In addition, cross-talk between both TNF-Rs has been described [17].

Although extracellularly alike, the cytoplasmic tails of both TNF receptors are quite different; TNF-RI contains a death domain, whereas TNF-RII contains a TNF-associated factor (TRAF)-binding domain, which mediates the binding of different signaling proteins [14,15]. Nevertheless, both receptors activate similar IkB kinase (IKK) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways that mediate the activation of several transcription factors such as nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and AP-1, which regulate the production of effector molecules including cytokines, chemokines and inflammatory enzymes. In addition to gene activation, TNF-RI can trigger cell death. Recruitment and activation of caspases play a crucial role in the initiation and

execution of TNF-induced apoptosis. TNF-RI can also trigger an alternative cell death pathway, namely necrosis, also called necroptosis. The latter depends on the kinase activity of the serine-threonine kinases RIP1 (receptor interacting protein 1) and RIP3. TNF-induced cell death signaling is counteracted by TNF-induced NF-κB activation, which results in the production of several anti-apoptotic proteins. In addition, there is significant cross-talk between the different TNF-induced signaling pathways at different levels. For a detailed overview of TNF-induced cell death signaling we refer to a recently published review [18]. Here we will focus on TNF-RI-induced NF-κB signaling, which is believed to mediate many of the pro-inflammatory functions of TNF. Posttranslational modifications play a key regulatory role and it is now evident that nearly every step of TNF-RI signaling is regulated by ubiquitination. First the ubiquitination process and ubiquitination machinery will be discussed, and then the role of ubiquitination in the regulation of TNF-RI-induced NF-κB signaling will be addressed. Although ubiquitination regulates NF-κB activity both in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus, we will here focus on cytoplasmic ubiquitination. For more information on the nuclear regulation of NF-κB we refer to another review [19].

2. Protein ubiquitination

Ubiquitin is a 76-amino acid long protein that can be coupled to another protein by an isopeptide bond between its C-terminal Gly76 residue and the ε-amino group of a Lys residue of its substrate in a process called ubiquitination (also referred to as ubiquitylation). As a result, the ubiquitinated protein gains or looses its function as it becomes programmed to interact, to become active and/or to be degraded. First, the outcome of ubiquitination is dictated by the type of ubiquitination, such as mono-, multi-mono- (monoubiquitination of multiple Lys residues in one protein) or polyubiquitination (each ubiquitin contains seven Lys residues that can themselves be ubiquitinated, forming a polyubiquitin chain) [20]. Secondly, also the type of di-ubiquitin linkage in between consecutive ubiquitin moieties of the ubiquitin chain is important for the reprogramming of the target protein. For this, ubiquitin molecules are linked to each other by an isopeptide bond between Gly76 of the first ubiquitin moiety and the ε-amino group of one of the 7 Lys residues within the second moiety (Lys6, Lys11, Lys27, Lys29, Lys33, Lys48 or Lys63) (Fig. 1). More recently, also di-ubiquitin linkage between the carboxyl group of Gly76 and the α-amino group of Met1 of another ubiquitin molecule was described, resulting in Met1 polyubiquitin chains (mostly referred to as linear polyubiquitin) [21]. To increase complexity even further, polyubiquitin chains can consist of more than one type of linkage (mixed or forked), although the functional relevance of the latter is not yet understood [22]. Each one of the eight different di-ubiquitin linkages creates unique structural motifs that are not shared with any other di-ubiquitin linkage [23]. For instance, Lys63-linked and linear polyubiquitin chains display a more extended conformation, while Lys48-linked chains show a more compact structure. Also the continuous surface between the two linked ubiquitin moieties and the relative position of the two neighboring ubiquitin moieties to one another determine specificity. These structural differences can be read and decoded by different ubiquitin binding proteins (also referred to as ubiquitin

Fig. 1. Overview of different types of ubiquitination and their functional outcome. Substrates can be modified with one (mono) or multiple (multi-mono) single ubiquitin peptides, or by polyubiquitin chains consisting of multiple ubiquitin molecules that are coupled to each other by an isopeptide bond between any of the seven different Lys residues of ubiquitin itself and the C-terminal Gly of another ubiquitin. Polyubiquitin chains can also be made by peptide bonds between the C-terminal end of one ubiquitin and the N-terminal end of another ubiquitin (linear). The type of ubiquitination determines the functional outcome for the modified protein (only the best described functions are given as an example). Unanchored polyubiquitin chains can also play a role in signaling.

receptors) that contain specific ubiquitin binding domains (UBDs) and which determine the outcome of ubiquitination [24]. Over 20 different types of UBDs have been identified, and many of these can be found in NF-κB regulatory proteins: for example the UBAN domain present in NEMO, ABINs and optineurin, the Npl4 zinc finger (NZF) in TAB2, TAB3, HOIP and HOIL-1, the zinc finger ubiquitin binding domain (ZnF UBP) in TAX1BP1, and the Ubc-like domains in Ubc and Uev E2 enzymes [24].

### 2.1. Enzymes involved in protein ubiquitination

Ubiquitination is accomplished by the concerted action of three types of enzymes: ubiquitin activating enzymes (E1), ubiquitin conjugating enzymes (E2), and ubiquitin ligases (E3) [25]. In humans at least two E1s are known, 50 E2s and over 600 E3s. E1 activates the ubiquitin molecule by forming an E1-ubiquitin thioester in an ATP-dependent manner. The activated ubiquitin is then transferred to most E2s to form an E2-ubiquitin thioester. E2s can then, with the help of an E3 that they select, attach the ubiquitin peptide to the substrate (Fig. 2) [25,26]. Whereas E3 determines the substrate specificity, E2s have a dominant role in determining which of the seven Lys residues of ubiquitin is used for polyubiquitination and deciding between mono and polyubiquitination, although also here E3 may have a controlling function [27,28]. In addition, some E2s function at their best to initiate ubiquitination, whereas others mainly function to elongate ubiquitin chains [29,30]. The E3s can be subdivided into different categories: the RING (really interesting new gene) ligases, HECT (homologous to E6-accessory protein carboxy terminus) ligases, U-box ligases, and A20-type C₂/C₂ zinc finger ligases [31]. HECT ligases form a thiol ester with activated ubiquitin and transfer it to the substrate, while RING ligases rather function as scaffold proteins facilitating the transfer of ubiquitin from the E2 directly to the substrate. Some RING enzymes can interact themselves with the ubiquitin substrate, while others function in a multi-protein E3 complex, with other subunits providing the substrate binding. U-box E3 enzymes are similar to RING ligases, but do not have the zinc-coordinating Cys and His residues. They can only form polyubiquitin chains in an E1/E2 dependent manner. The most recently identified E3s are the A20-type E3s with A20 as the best characterized one in the context of TNF signaling [32].

### 2.2. Reversal of ubiquitination by DUBs

Ubiquitination of a substrate can be reversed by isopeptidases or de-ubiquitinases (DUBs). The human genome encodes for 95 putative DUBs that belong to five subclasses: UCH (Ubiquitin Carboxyterminal Hydrolases), USPs (Ubiquitin-Specific Proteases), MJD (Machado-Joseph Disease protein domain) proteases, OTU (Ovarian Tumor) proteases, and JAMM (JAB1/MPN/Mov34 motif) proteases [33]. These Cys- or metalloproteases hydrolyze the amide bond between ubiquitin and the target protein or between 2 consecutive ubiquitin moieties. They can remove one ubiquitin (exopeptidases) or a whole ubiquitin chain (endopeptidases). In the case of a polyubiquitinated protein, DUBs are believed to first cleave off the (poly)ubiquitin chain from the substrate protein prior to chopping the polyubiquitin chain into single ubiquitin moieties that can be recycled [34]. Indeed, some DUBs do not (only) target anchored polyubiquitin chains, but (also) free polyubiquitin chains [35]. Substrate or ubiquitin chain linkage specificity of DUBs is at least partially generated by the presence of specific UBDs [33]. This however does not mean that belonging to a certain DUB family restricts the preference towards just one type of polyubiquitin chain for all family members [36].

### 3. Polyubiquitination drives TNF-RI-mediated NF-κB signaling

NF-κB is a pivotal transcription factor in a diversity of processes, ranging from inflammation and immunity to cell survival and proliferation [37,38]. The NF-κB family consists of five members: RelA (p65), c-Rel, RelB, NF-κB1 (p50 and its precursor p105) and NF-κB2 (p52 and its precursor p100) [39]. All NF-κB members form dimers, of which the heterodimers RelA/p50, c-Rel/p50 and RelB/p52 are responsible for NF-κB mediated gene activation. In contrast, homodimers of p50 and p52 act as transcriptional repressors. In resting cells, NF-κB is kept silent in the cytoplasm by its interaction with members of the inhibitor of κB (IκB) family. These proteins prevent the nuclear translocation and DNA binding of NF-κB by masking the nuclear localization signal of at least one member of the NF-κB dimer.

NF-κB activation comes in two flavors. The classical or canonical NF-κB pathway is initiated upon triggering of TNF-RI and several other receptors involved in innate immunity and leads to the activation of RelA/p50 [40]. The latter is normally kept inactive in the cytoplasm by its binding to IκB family proteins. Classical NF-κB activation requires the activation of the IKK complex, which consists of the catalytic subunits IKKα and IKKβ and the regulatory subunit NEMO (also known as IKKγ). IKKβ-mediated phosphorylation of IκBα, which is believed to be the major IκB protein that regulates the classical NF-κB pathway, triggers its proteasomal degradation and the nuclear translocation of NF-κB. A number of other receptors such as CD40 and lymphotoxin β receptor trigger a non-canonical or alternative NF-κB pathway [41]. This pathway is characterized by the activation of the kinases NIK and IKKα. These phosphorylate the IκB family member p100 and trigger its proteasome-mediated processing to p52, which dimerizes with RelB to activate specific NF-κB responsive genes. Interestingly, NIK mutations have been identified in multiple myeloma, suggesting that NIK may be an important therapeutic target [42]. In the rest of this review we will focus on the activation of the classical NF-κB pathway by TNF-RI.

#### 3.1. IKK activation by Lys63-linked polyubiquitination

Upon TNF ligation, TNF-RI trimerizes and transiently translocates to lipid rafts [43], which enables interaction with the adaptor protein TRADD (TNF-RI-associated death domain) through a homotypic interaction of their respective death domains [44].

**Fig. 2. Overview of the different steps involved in protein ubiquitination.** The ubiquitination process is a 3-step process that makes use of an ubiquitin activating enzyme (E1), an ubiquitin conjugating enzyme (E2) and an ubiquitin ligase (E3). E1 activates the ubiquitin molecule in an ATP-dependent way, which is required for its transfer to E2. With the help of E3, which binds and chooses the substrate, the E2 can then conjugate ubiquitin to a substrate or another ubiquitin molecule.

Ub Ub Ub Ub Ub Ub Ub Ub Ub Ub Ub Ub Ub Ub Ub Ub Ub Ub Ub Ub Ub Ub Ub Ub Ub Ub Ub Ub Ub Ub Ub Ub Ub Ub Ub Ub Ub Ub Ub Ububiquitin chain on RIP1 engages and activates 2 kinase complexes: the TAK1 (transforming growth factor-β activated kinase 1) complex consisting of the Ser/Thr kinase TAK1 and the adaptor proteins TAB1/TAB2/TAB3 (TAK1 binding protein 1/2/3), and the IKK complex. Recruitment and binding of these kinase complexes to Lys63-polyubiquitinated RIP1 is mediated by specific UBDs in the kinase adaptor proteins (ZnF UBP and CUE domains in TAB2/3, and UBAN and ZnF type domains in NEMO) [53,54]. In addition, TNF also induces Lys63-polyubiquitination of TAK1 within its kinase domain, which is essential for its own kinase activation and the TAK1-mediated recruitment and activation of the IKK complex [55]. The piling up of all these ubiquitination events most likely serves to stabilize the formation of a large supramolecular signaling complex in which TAK1 phosphorylates two Ser residues in the activation loop of the kinase domains of IKKα (Ser176 and Ser180) and IKKβ (Ser177 and Ser181) resulting in their activation [56].

Although several models implicate an important role for Lys63-polyubiquitination of RIP1 in TNF-induced NF-κB signaling, a number of recent reports indicated that these models may be incorrect. Most importantly, replacement of endogenous ubiquitin with a mutant version that no longer allows Lys63 linkage formation impairs IKK activation in response to IL-1 but not TNF, which is indicative of a distinct ubiquitination mechanism [57]. Consistent with these findings is the observation that TNF-induced RIP1 ubiquitination and downstream IKK activation is normal in cells that lack Ubc13, the only E2 that is known to specifically synthesize Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains [58]. Although Lys63-polyubiquitination does not appear to be required for IKK activation in the TNF pathway, ubiquitination is required, as RNA interference of E1, ubiquitin, or the E2 Ubc5 prevents TNF-induced activation of IKK [57]. These studies also showed that Ubc5 and cIAP1 can support TNF-induced ubiquitination of RIP1 by non-Lys63-polyubiquitin chains. A modified tandem affinity purification approach revealed that RIP1 can undergo four different types of polyubiquitination in response to TNF: linear, Lys11-, Lys48-, and Lys63-polyubiquitination [59]. As cIAPs can perform different types of polyubiquitination, they are acceptable candidates to mediate at least Lys11-, Lys48- and Lys63-polyubiquitination of RIP1 [60]. It should be mentioned that the essential role of RIP1 in TNF-induced NF-κB activation has recently been questioned based on the finding that multiple cell types from E18 RIP1 knockout embryos can still activate NF-κB in response to TNF [61], which contradicts previous findings [47] and is still a matter of intense debate.

### 3.2. IKK activation by linear polyubiquitination

Recent studies suggest that linear ubiquitination of NEMO, and possibly also RIP1, by the tripartite linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC) play an important role in TNF-induced NF-κB activation [62]. Linear polyubiquitin chains are not formed by Lys linkages, but by linkages between the C- and N-termini of ubiquitin. The LUBAC complex is composed of two RING domain containing E3 ligases, HOIL-1 (heme-oxidized IRP2 ubiquitin ligase-1) and HOIP (HOIL-1 interacting protein), and SHARPIN (SHANK-associated RH domain-interacting protein) as a third component [21,63–66]. However, also HOIL-1/HOIP and SHARPIN/HOIP complexes do exist. Interactions within the LUBAC complex rely on the UBL (ubiquitin-like) domains of HOIL-1 and SHARPIN and the UBA-type UBD of HOIP. All LUBAC components also contain a NZF-type UBD that can bind Lys48-, Lys63- or linear linked polyubiquitin chains but with different affinities: while HOIP shows strong affinity for Lys63-linked ubiquitin chains and intermediate binding capacity to Lys48- and linear chains, HOIL-1 almost exclusively binds linear ubiquitin chains. Although HOIP

as well as HOIL-1 are E3 ligases, only the E3 activity of HOIP is indispensable for TNF-induced NF-κB activation [59,63–66]. TNF induces the recruitment of LUBAC to the TNF-RI signaling complex, which is dependent on TRADD, TRAF2 and the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of cIAPs [63,64]. LUBAC recruitment to TNF-RI therefore most likely involves different types of cIAP-mediated ubiquitination on multiple signaling proteins. Elimination of one of the LUBAC components reduces TNF-induced NF-κB activation, which mainly reflects a destabilization of the TNF-RI signaling complex. Once LUBAC is recruited to the TNF-RI signaling complex, it targets NEMO for linear ubiquitination at Lys285 and Lys309, which is then sensed by the UBAN-type UBD of NEMO itself [63,64]. It should be mentioned that although NEMO can also be modified by Lys63-polyubiquitin chains, the linear ubiquitin linkage is currently the only linkage type that has been unequivocally shown to be present on NEMO when it forms part of the native TNF-RI signaling complex [59]. Even though the UBAN domain of NEMO can also bind to Lys63-linked and, as recently shown, Lys11-linked linear polyubiquitin [60], the interaction with Met1-linked linear di-ubiquitin is of about 100-fold higher affinity than with Lys63-linked di-ubiquitin [67,68]. This results in the multimerization of IKK complexes, which is believed to facilitate transphosphorylation and subsequent activation of IKK. To a lesser extent, LUBAC uploads also RIP1 with linear polyubiquitin, but the function of the latter is not clear yet [59]. Apart from LUBAC, also cIAPs were recently shown to modify RIP1 with linear ubiquitin chains, at least in vitro [69]. In conclusion, all these findings support a model in which the potential of LUBAC to form linear ubiquitin chains stabilizes the TNF-RI signaling complex, enabling efficient TNF-induced NF-κB activation. The emerging picture is that different types of ubiquitin linkages present in the TNF-RI signaling complex each serve discrete and specific functions. How they cooperate to achieve a TNF signaling output at the exact physiologically required level remains to be discovered.

#### 3.3. IkBα degradation by Lys48-linked polyubiquitination

Once activated, the IKK complex can phosphorylate the NF-κB inhibitory protein IkBα, which is the main IkB protein regulating TNF-induced NF-κB activity, on Ser32 and Ser36. These phosphorylation sites create a binding platform for an SCF-type E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. The SCF complex that ubiquitates IkBα is composed of the adapter protein Skp1, the scaffold protein cullin-1, the RING domain protein Rbx1 (Roc or Hrt1), and the substrate recognizing F-box adaptor protein β-TrCP [70]. Modification of cullin-1 with the ubiquitin-like protein NEDD8 enhances recruitment of the E2 enzyme Ubc4 to the SCF E3 complex, thus accelerating the formation of an E2/E3 complex. Binding of β-TrCP with IkBα enables its Lys48-polyubiquitination at Lys21 and Lys22, which catalyzes the rapid degradation of IkBα by the 26S proteasome. Once liberated from their inhibitor, NF-κB dimers enter the nucleus where they bind specific κB sites present in the promoter of various target genes.

### 4. Negative regulators of TNF-RI-mediated NF-κB signaling affecting ubiquitination

The TNF-RI-induced signaling pathway to NF-κB is packed with ubiquitination events. It is thus more than evident that cells encode several proteins, partly as a consequence of TNF-induced gene induction, that negatively regulate NF-κB signaling by targeting ubiquitination (Table 1). These include E3 ligases that modify specific signaling components with Lys48-linked poly-ubiquitin chains, targeting them for proteasomal degradation. In addition, specific DUBs are capable of cleaving specific ubiquitin linkages, resulting in the disassembly of the initially formed

### 4.1. The A20 ubiquitin editing complex

One of the proteins with a key role in the fine-tuning of TNF-induced NF-κB activation is the ubiquitin-editing protein A20 (also known as TNFAIP3) [71], which was initially shown to interact with TRAF2 and to inhibit TNF-induced NF-κB activation upon overexpression [72]. Expression of A20 is itself under the control of NF-κB and thus provides negative feedback regulation of NF-κB signaling [73]. The physiological importance of A20 has been nicely demonstrated by the observation that A20 deficient mice show premature death because of TNF-induced chronic inflammation in several tissues [74]. More recently, we and others described several cell type-specific knockout mice, showing that A20 expression is a key regulator of NF-κB signaling in macrophages, dendritic cells, B cells, keratinocytes and intestinal epithelial cells and that its absence in different cell types results in different inflammatory phenotypes [75–80]. For example, mice lacking A20 expression in myeloid cells spontaneously develop rheumatoid arthritis-like symptoms [78], whereas mice lacking A20 in intestinal epithelial cells are hypersensitive to experimentally induced colitis [79]. In line with the above observations, genome wide association studies have pinpointed human A20 as a susceptibility locus in multiple inflammatory and autoimmune diseases such as Crohn’s disease, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, psoriasis and type 1 diabetes [81].

A20 interferes with TNF-induced NF-κB activation by affecting the ubiquitination status of specific signaling proteins. A20 contains both an OTU DUB domain and a Cys2/Cys2 ZnF E3 ligase domain, and attenuates TNF-induced NF-κB signaling in a two-step process [32,82]. In a first step, the A20 DUB domain removes Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains from RIP1, a key mediator in TNF-induced NF-κB signaling. This first step is required for the second step, which is the Lys48-linked polyubiquitination of RIP1 by the A20 E3 ligase domain, leading to the proteasomal degradation of RIP1. The C-terminal region of A20 contains seven ZnFs, with the fourth ZnF playing a key role in the E3 ligase activity. More specifically this ZnF was shown to bind mono-ubiquitin and Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains [83], explaining the interdependent activities of the A20 ZnF and OTU domains that are inherent to the ubiquitin editing process. In the TNF-induced NF-κB pathway, A20 has also been shown to remove Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains from NEMO [84], and it can be expected that it also targets other substrates in this pathway. Remarkably, the recombinant A20DUB domain preferentially cleaves Lys48 and not Lys63 linkages *in vitro* [85,86], supporting the idea that the specificity of A20 (and most likely also other DUBs) can change when bound to other proteins or when recruited to a particular signaling complex. A20 can also inhibit TNF-induced NF-κB activation by disrupting the interaction between the E2 enzyme Ubc5 and the E3 ligases cIAP1 and TRAF2 upon TNF stimulation. Moreover, at later time points A20 also interacts with Ubc5 and triggers its Lys48-polyubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation [87].

A20 is recruited to the TNF-RI signaling complex as part of a larger A20 ubiquitin-editing complex consisting of the adaptor protein TAX1BP1 (Tax1 binding protein 1), and the E3 ligases Itch and RNF11 (Ring finger protein 11). TAX1BP1 has been shown to facilitate the recruitment of A20 to Lys63-polyubiquitinated RIP1 via its ZF UBD and to increase A20-mediated de-ubiquitination of RIP1 [88–90]. In addition, TAX1BP1 also collaborates with A20 to disrupt Ubc5 E2 binding to the E3 ligases TRAF2 and cIAP1 [87]. The E3 ubiquitin ligases Itch and RNF11 help to steer A20-mediated RIP1 Lys48-polyubiquitination but the underlying molecular mechanism is still unclear [91,92]. In addition, several other A20-binding proteins have been proposed to control its NF-κB inhibitory function. ABIN (A20-binding inhibitor of NF-κB)-1, ABIN-2 and ABIN-3 are A20-binding proteins that were shown to inhibit TNF-induced NF-κB activation upon overexpression [93–96]. We previously demonstrated that ABINs share with the IKK adaptor protein NEMO a UBAN UBD that is essential for their NF-κB inhibitory function [97]. Recent work indicated that the UBAN domain can bind both Lys63-linked and linear polyubiquitin chains, with a preference for linear chains [23,68,98]. Based on this, one can speculate that ABINs may recruit A20 to linear or Lys63-polyubiquitinated substrates. This is further supported by the finding that ABIN-1 increases the de-ubiquitination of NEMO by A20 [84]. On the other hand, functional analysis of different ABIN-1 mutants has shown that ABIN-1 binding to A20 is not essential for its NF-κB inhibitory function [99]. This has led to a model in which

ABIN-1 may disrupt NF-κB signaling complexes by competing with NEMO or other UBD-containing proteins for the binding of linear or Lys63-linked polyubiquitinated signaling proteins such as RIP1 or NEMO. The NF-κB inhibitory function of ABINs is still controversial since studies with cells from ABIN-1 or ABIN-2 deficient mice did not show an effect of ABIN deficiency on TNF-induced NF-κB activation [100–102]. It should also be mentioned that in one study ABIN-1 deficiency was embryonic lethal [100], whereas in another study it was not and in this case ABIN-1 deficiency resulted in a progressive lupus-like inflammatory disease that was proposed to involve a selective deregulation of the transcription factor C/EBPβ [102]. However, knockin mice expressing a ubiquitin-binding deficient ABIN1[D485N] mutant, which also progressively develop autoimmunity, do show an NF-κB inhibitory function of ABIN-1, although this was restricted to Toll-like receptor-induced NF-κB activation [103]. These data indicate that cell type-specific or stimulus-specific redundancy may exist between ABIN-1, -2, -3, and possibly other ubiquitin-binding proteins for controlling NF-κB activation. In this context, Ymer and ZNF216 are two other A20-binding proteins that were shown to bind Lys63-polyubiquitinated RIP1 and which may collaborate with A20 to inhibit NF-κB signaling [104,105].

### 4.2. A20-like proteins, USPs and E3 ligases

A number of A20-like proteins have been identified. Cezanne (cellular zinc finger anti-NF-κB) has an OTU domain and a Cys₂/ZnF domain. Similar to A20, Cezanne is recruited to the TNF-RI complex upon TNF stimulation and promotes RIP1 de-ubiquitination, thereby decreasing NF-κB signaling [106]. Interestingly, Cezanne was identified as the first DUB that cleaves Lys11-linked polyubiquitin chains *in vitro* [107], suggesting a potential role in the removal of Lys11-linked polyubiquitin chains in the TNF-RI signaling complex.

Besides A20 and the A20-like protein Cezanne, several other DUBs have been reported to negatively regulate TNF-induced NF-κB activation and their number is still growing. Many of these belong to the USP (ubiquitin-specific protease) family (CYLD, USP4, USP11, USP15, USP21 and USP31), which is the largest DUB family (Table 1). CYLD has been shown to disassemble Lys63-linked ubiquitin chains from NEMO, RIP1 and TRAF2, thereby attenuating downstream NF-κB signaling [108–110]. Interestingly, CYLD is the only DUB known to be associated with the TNF-RI signaling complex that was shown to be capable of cleaving linear ubiquitin chains in addition to Lys63-linked chains, at least *in vitro* [23], suggesting a possible role of CYLD in the negative regulation of linear ubiquitination by LUBAC. In this context, it is interesting to note that optineurin (OPTN), another UBAN-domain-containing protein besides ABINs and NEMO that can bind linear and Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains [111], has been shown to be required for CYLD’s capability to inhibit TNF-induced NF-κB activation [112]. Recently, also USP4 was shown to downregulate TNF-induced NF-κB activation in two independent studies. Fan and colleagues showed that TNF induced the association of USP4 with TAK1 to de-ubiquitinate TAK1 [113]. Consequently, knockdown of USP4 enhanced TNF-induced NF-κB activation. In another study, USP4 was shown to negatively regulate TNF-induced NF-κB activation by de-ubiquitinating TRAF2 [114]. Another DUB, USP21, is constitutively associated with RIP1 and de-ubiquitates RIP1 [115]. Knockdown of USP21 enhances TNF-induced RIP1 polyubiquitination and NF-κB dependent gene expression. Recently USP21 was shown to be active on Lys11, Lys48, Lys63 and linear tetraubiquitin chains *in vitro* [116], suggesting that it may target different types of ubiquitin linkage on RIP1. USP31 is a DUB that shows higher activity towards Lys63-linked chains compared to Lys48-linked chains and which has also been implicated in the

negative regulation of NF-κB signaling [117]. The underlying mechanism is still unclear but USP31 has been shown to interact with TRAF2 and RelA. Finally, USP11 and USP15 are two DUBs that associate with and de-ubiquitinate IkBα, resulting in its stabilization. Knockdown of these DUBs enhances TNF-induced IkBα ubiquitination and NF-κB activation [118,119]. It is clear from the above that the list of DUBs that negatively regulate NF-κB activation is steadily growing. Many of these enzymes target identical NF-κB signaling proteins, making it hard to understand why a cell needs more than one enzyme to perform the same task. It should be mentioned that evidence for the role of the above reported DUBs in the regulation of TNF-induced NF-κB signaling is in many cases (with the exception of A20 and CYLD) still based on studies with cultured cells in which expression was modulated by overexpression or siRNA-mediated knockdown. It will therefore be important to confirm these findings in more physiological conditions using gene targeting studies in mice.

Although cIAP1 and cIAP2 are implicated in the Lys63-polyubiquitination of RIP1 and possibly other proteins in the TNF-RI signaling complex, these E3 ubiquitin ligases have also been shown to modify TRAF2 with Lys48-linked chains, leading to its proteasomal degradation and inhibition of NF-κB signaling [120,121]. Similarly, whereas HOIL-1 positively regulates TNF-induced NF-κB activation by participating in the linear ubiquitination of NEMO and RIP1, it has also been reported that HOIL-1 can downregulate the TNF-induced NF-κB pathway by targeting TAB2/3 for proteasomal degradation [122]. The mechanisms that determine whether cIAPs or HOIL-1 promote or inhibit NF-κB activation are still unknown. Finally, a role for Siah proteins in NF-κB regulation has also been suggested. Siah proteins have structural and functional similarities to TRAF proteins: both have RING E3 domains and Siah proteins have zinc fingers with sequence similarity to TRAF zinc fingers [123]. Siah2 has been shown to function as a TRAF2 ubiquitin ligase and promote TRAF2 turnover [124].

## 5. Concluding remarks

Step by step, the TNF-induced NF-κB pathway is slowly revealing itself, astonishing researchers with its complexity and versatility. In many aspects, the study of the TNF-RI signaling complex and its regulation has helped our current understanding of how receptor complexes are built and can perform their duty. Initially, one had the naïve idea that it was just a matter of connecting all the partners together in their proper configuration with some phosphorylation events as topping. The finding that ubiquitin is at the heart of TNF signaling opened our eyes about how versatile a small molecule can be. Recruitment, ubiquitination and activation of signaling proteins are so intimately linked, that tinkering at one component can disequilibrate the complete system and lead to inflammatory and auto-immune disorders.

Despite major progress in our understanding of TNF-RI-induced NF-κB signaling, many questions still remain to be solved which will require a keen eye for small details. More and more, the idea of an ‘ubiquitin code’ in NF-κB signaling is gaining ground, but the big challenge will be to decipher it correctly. Until now, studies were mainly limited to the modification of proteins by Lys48, Lys63 and linear polyubiquitin chains, but there is no reason to believe that other chain types would not be involved. So far this has just been a matter of available tools. It will therefore also be important to rigorously test the specificity of E3 ligases and DUBs for their ability to build or remove, respectively, the different types of ubiquitin chains. We have also no idea on the length of different polyubiquitin chains and the impact this may have on signaling. Unravelling the role of each type of ubiquitination in the formation and dismantling of particular NF-κB signaling complexes will

require a combination of advanced genomics and proteomics approaches that allow to study these processes at high resolution and with high sensitivity. Moreover, it will be important to follow this in time and to do this in different cell types, as it can be expected that highly dynamic ubiquitin-editing complexes exist in different cells. Eventually, it will be highly interesting to find out if perturbation of specific ubiquitination or de-ubiquitination activities in the TNF-induced NF-kB signaling pathway play a role in TNF-dependent autoimmunity and inflammation, and if we can manipulate this in a way that could enable us to devise novel therapies.

Kelly Verhelst graduated as a master in biotechnology in 2005 and some months ago she obtained her PhD in sciences - biotechnology at the Ghent University and VIB in the lab of Rudi Beyaert on the structure-function analysis of the ubiquitin-editing NF-κB inhibitor protein A20. She is currently continuing this research as a postdoc in Rudi Beyaert’s lab.


Isabelle Carpentier obtained her PhD in sciences - biotechnology at Ghent University in 2003 on the functional characterization of TRAF proteins under the mentorship of Rudi Beyaert. She is currently working as a postdoc in his lab and was appointed as joint lecturer in 2009. Her main interest is to elucidate the molecular mechanism of action of the NF-κB inhibitory proteins A20 and ABINs in inflammatory signaling.


Rudi Beyaert obtained his PhD in sciences - biotechnology at the Ghent University in 1992 under the mentorship of Walter Fiers where he continued his research on the biology of TNF as a postdoc. In 1996 he started the Laboratory of Molecular Signal Transduction in Inflammation at the Flanders Institute for Biotechnology (VIB) and Ghent University. In 2003 he was appointed as Full Professor in Molecular Biology at the Ghent University and in 2006 he became the Associate Director of the Department for Molecular Biomedical Research of the VIB. Rudi Beyaert is now heading a research group of 20 researchers who mainly focus on the molecular mechanisms that control NF-κB signaling in innate immunity and inflammation.
