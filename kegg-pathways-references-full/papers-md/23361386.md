Axonal transport deficits and neurodegenerative diseases

**Stéphanie Millecamps**¹ **and Jean-Pierre Julien**²

Abstract | The intracellular transport of organelles along an axon is crucial for the maintenance and function of a neuron. Anterograde axonal transport has a role in supplying proteins and lipids to the distal synapse and mitochondria for local energy requirements, whereas retrograde transport is involved in the clearance of misfolded and aggregated proteins from the axon and the intracellular transport of distal trophic signals to the soma. Axonal transport can be affected by alterations to various components of the transport machinery. Here, we review the current state of knowledge about axonal transport defects that might contribute to the pathogenesis of particular neurodegenerative diseases.

Neurofilaments  
Neurofilaments are components of the neuronal cytoskeleton. They are intermediate filaments with a diameter of 10 nm and are composed of three subunits: the neurofilament light, medium and heavy chains.

Axonal transport is an essential process in neurons because of the extreme polarity and size of these cells. Indeed, despite having axons of more than 1 metre in length, human spinal motor neurons, like other types of neurons, require efficient communication between their cell body and axon tip. Axonal transport keeps axons and nerve terminals supplied with proteins, lipids and mitochondria, and clears recycled or misfolded proteins to avoid the build-up of toxic aggregates¹. Apart from its role in neuronal metabolism, axonal transport is crucial for intracellular neural transmission and allows the neuron to respond effectively to trophic signals or stress insults¹.

Impairment of axonal transport has recently emerged as a common factor in several neurodegenerative disorders¹. Here, we review the current state of knowledge about axonal transport defects that are associated with such disorders, with a specific focus on the mechanisms that can affect microtubule-based axonal transport. Before doing so, we outline the various components and mechanisms that control such transport.

### Microtubule-based axonal transport

Microtubules are the main component of the cytoskeleton. They have a tubular structure (25 nm in diameter) and are composed of many α- and β-tubulin heterodimers, which undergo continuous polymerization and depolymerization at the centrosome¹. Microtubules are polarized in axons (but not in dendrites): their slower growing minus end (at which α-tubulin is exposed) faces the cell body, whereas their faster growing plus end (at which β-tubulin is exposed) points towards the axon tips. They are stabilized by microtubule-associated proteins such as tau. Microtubules in the axon essentially form tracks along which various cargoes can be transported by various motor proteins.

The various cargoes that are transported along microtubules in axons (TABLE 1) move in a saltatory fashion, exhibiting periods of rapid movements, pauses and directional switches. Filamentous cargoes, such as neurofilaments, exhibit long periods of rest (spending on average 73% of the time pausing) and movements mainly in an anterograde direction (that is, towards the cell body) at 0.23 μm per second²³. By contrast, vesicular cargoes, such as lysosomes, show frequent pausing and directional switches, and other vesicular structures such as autophagosomes exhibit persistent movements (they only pause 12% of the time) in a mainly retrograde direction (that is, away from the cell body) at 0.46 μm per second⁴. Thus, the average transport velocity of a particular cargo depends on the time that the cargo spends pausing. As neurofilament proteins move at a faster transport rate when axons are devoid of pre-existing neurofilament structures *in vivo*, one of the key determinants that curbs the axonal transport of cytoskeleton components is the density of the stationary cytoskeletal network in the axons⁵. The transport of mitochondria and lysosomes is also dependent on cytoskeletal organization⁶.

For convenience, axonal transport can be divided into two categories: fast axonal transport, which is responsible for moving membrane-bound organelles (vesicles and mitochondria), and slow axonal transport, which drives the movement of cytoplasmic proteins (including various enzymes) and cytoskeletal

The superfamily of human kinesins comprises about 40 proteins<sup>10</sup>. Kinesin-1 is a heterotetramer that is composed of two kinesin heavy chains (KHCs) and two kinesin light chains (KLCs). Each KHC contains a globular motor domain that binds to microtubules and ATP, a neck linker, an α-helical stalk that is involved in dimerization and a tail that associates with a KLC to bind cargoes<sup>10</sup>. In mammals, there are three genes that code for different KHC subunits (KIF5A, KIF5B and KIF5C)<sup>11</sup>. KIF5B is expressed in all cell types, whereas KIF5A and KIF5C are only expressed in neurons<sup>11</sup>. After the attachment of the motor domain to microtubules and the tail regions to the cargoes, kinesin-1 ‘walks’ along the microtubule, enabling the transport of the cargoes<sup>10</sup>. The kinesin front head, which remains bound to microtubules, hydrolyses ATP and that moves the detached rear head towards the microtubule plus end. The binding of kinesin-1 to microtubules is promoted by tubulin acetylation<sup>12</sup>, whereas the attachment of cargoes to kinesin-1 can be promoted by adaptor proteins in the soma<sup>10</sup>. Among these adaptor proteins, those that specifically bind to KLCs, such as c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)-interacting protein 1 (JIP1), direct cargo to axons<sup>13</sup>, whereas those that specifically bind KHCs, such as glutamate receptor-interacting protein 1 (GRIP1), send the cargo to dendrites<sup>14</sup>.

Cytoplasmic dynein 1 is a multisubunit complex containing two catalytic heavy chains, two intermediate chains, four light intermediate chains and several light chains<sup>15</sup>. The dynein heavy chains (cytoplasmic dynein 1 heavy chain 1 (DYNC1H1)) have globular motor domains that can exhibit ATPase activity; these domains bind to microtubules through their coiled-coil stalks and to the intermediate and light chains through their extended tail<sup>15</sup>. During cargo transport, one stalk remains bound to the microtubules while the other one detaches and reattaches to the microtubule, which allows the dynein complex, like kinesins, to walk for long distances. The binding of the cargo to the intermediate and light dynein chains is modulated by dynactin, which is a multiprotein complex that contains a rod domain for cargo binding and a projecting arm with two globular microtubule-binding sites. In total, the dynactin complex comprises 20 polypeptides (ten different ones), including α-centractin (also known as ARP1) in the rod domain, and dynactin subunit 1 (DCTN1; also known as p150<sup>glued</sup>) and DCTN2 (also known as p50 dynamitin) in the projecting arm<sup>16</sup>.

Myosin Va is involved in the transport of cargoes along the actin filaments that are enriched in nerve terminals<sup>17</sup>. Myosin Va has two head motor domains, containing actin- and ATP-binding sites, two α-helical segments that bind to calmodulin and two glomerular tail domains that bind cargoes<sup>17</sup>. Evidence from several studies indicates that myosin Va can also participate in microtubule-mediated axonal transport. This motor protein can interact with KHCs directly<sup>18</sup>, with microtubules through its tail domain<sup>19</sup> and with the neurofilament light chain (NFL) through its head motor domain<sup>20,21</sup>. Neurons from myosin Va-null mice showed slower retrograde axonal transport, establishing

proteins (microtubules and neurofilaments)<sup>7</sup>. The various cargoes are all powered along the microtubule network by molecular motors, which require ATP to provide energy.

Kinesins are understood to be the main molecular motors that drive cargoes along the microtubule ‘rails’ in the anterograde direction, whereas cytoplasmic dynein complexes are understood to drive retrograde microtubule-based transport (FIG. 1). Of note, the specific molecular motors that are involved in the slow axonal transport of microtubules and neurofilaments have not yet been fully identified, although studies involving neurons from kinesin-1 (also known as conventional kinesin)-knockout mice indicate that this kinesin is the principal but not exclusive anterograde motor for neurofilaments<sup>8,9</sup>. The transport of membrane-bound organelles (such as mitochondria, endosomes and lysosomes) is better characterized and largely carried out by kinesin and dynein motor proteins.

kinase (AKT1; also known as protein kinase B)²⁶ and some isoforms of protein kinase C (PKC)²⁷. Conversely, pathways for the activation of GSK3β require phosphatases to remove phosphate from GSK3β serine residues²⁸. As observed with GSK3β activation, inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) specifically decreases anterograde but not retrograde axonal transport²⁹. Inhibition of CDK5 has been proposed to activate protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) and, as a result, GSK3β, which leads to the release of kinesin from cargoes³⁰. Phosphorylation of cargoes also regulates axonal transport³¹,³² by promoting their release from molecular motors³³.

It has also been suggested that dynein- and kinesin-mediated transport is modulated by local gradients of microtubule-associated proteins in axons, such as tau, or by microtubule post-translational modification. In humans, there are six known tau isoforms that differ by the presence of three or four microtubule-binding domain repeats and by the presence or absence of one or two acidic inserts in their N-terminal projection domain. *In vitro* approaches suggest that a low concentration of tau in the proximal segment of the axon facilitates kinesin-mediated transport, whereas a high concentration of tau in the axon terminal is favourable for dynein-mediated transport³⁴. Tau promotes the detachment of kinesin from microtubules and restricts the distance travelled by kinesin along microtubules rich in GTP-tubulin³⁴,³⁵, whereas it can enhance kinesin velocity along microtubules composed of GDP-tubulin³⁶. These transport effects have not been confirmed *in vivo*, where neither overexpression of tau nor tau deletion alters fast or slow axonal transport³⁷. With regard to post-translation modifications, tubulin acetylation at Lys40 has been shown to enhance the recruitment of kinesin-1 to microtubules and promote anterograde transport of JIP1 in neuronal cells¹².

A recent report studying the axonal transport of vesicles containing the cellular prion protein (PrP<sup>C</sup>) showed that the composition of anterograde and retrograde motor subunits is the same in anterograde-directed, retrograde-directed and stationary PrP<sup>C</sup>-containing vesicles. Interestingly, this study showed that activation of retrograde motility requires vesicles to be associated with a kinesin-1 comprising KIF5C and KLC1 subunits, as removal of one of these subunits downregulated retrograde transport without any dissociation of DYNC1H1 from vesicles. Thus, PrP<sup>C</sup> vesicle transport is coordinated by a subset of opposing motor proteins that are all necessary for transport in any direction independently of cargo-association mechanisms³⁸.

**Neurodegenerative diseases**

Evidence of axonal transport defects in neurodegenerative diseases (TABLE 2) emerged from microscopy studies showing that, in these disorders, some cargoes that are usually conveyed along the axons, such as cytoskeletal components and mitochondria, can accumulate in the perikaryon, the proximal segment of the axon or the distal part of the axon. Several methods have been used in such studies to measure microtubule-based axonal transport *in vitro* and *in vivo* (BOX 1).

Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias. Alzheimer’s disease is the most common form of dementia and is characterized by the presence of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in brain tissue. Amyloid plaques are composed of deposits of the amyloid-β peptide, which is produced by cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by β-secretase (identified to be β-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1)) and γ-secretase, a multi-subunit protein complex in which presenilin 1 (PS1) or PS2 is the catalytic subunit. By contrast, neurofibrillary tangles are formed by aggregated, hyperphosphorylated tau. Genetics studies support causal roles for APP, PS1 and tau in dementia. Duplication of and mutations in APP and mutations in the presenilin genes are responsible for early-onset, familial forms of Alzheimer’s disease, whereas mutations in the gene encoding tau can cause tauopathies, including familial frontotemporal dementia with Parkinsonism<sup>39</sup>.

Several studies indicate that the pathological forms of APP, tau, PS1 and amyloid-β that can be found in Alzheimer’s disease affect fast axonal transport by various mechanisms (TABLE 1). Indeed, transgenic mice overexpressing wild-type or mutant APP<sup>40,41</sup>, mutant PS1 (REFS 42,43), or wild-type or mutant tau<sup>44,45</sup> display axonal transport deficits and axonal swelling that precede the deposition of amyloid-β or filamentous tau aggregates, suggesting that such deficits might be early events in Alzheimer’s disease. Here, we discuss the various mechanisms that may underlie these transport effects.

APP undergoes anterograde axonal transport and may act to link PS1 and BACE1 to kinesin motors through a direct interaction with KLCs<sup>46</sup>, although this view has been refuted by some researchers<sup>47</sup>. Radiolabelled injection of nerve growth factor (NGF) in the hippocampus showed that NGF retrograde transport was disrupted in transgenic mice overexpressing wild-type APP or swAPP (a mutant variant of APP linked to Swedish familial Alzheimer’s disease)<sup>41</sup>. This disruption was not due to a loss of NGF binding or internalization but might have resulted from an enlargement of early endosomes, which may be ineffectively transported<sup>41</sup>.

APP processing, from which the toxic amyloid-β peptide is generated, might occur during its axonal transit and is stimulated by axonal blockade<sup>46</sup>. In cortical neurons prepared from transgenic swAPP mice, an impairment of anterograde axonal transport by the depletion of KLC1 provoked an increase in APP retrograde transport and enhanced production of amyloid-β in axonal swelling<sup>40</sup>. Fluorescent imaging of cultured neurons revealed that APP and BACE1 move in distinct vesicles at different rates, challenging the hypothesis that APP cleavage occurs in moving vesicles<sup>48</sup>. Moreover, an increase in tau levels, which inhibits APP transport, did not increase amyloid-β production. Thus, the exact link between APP axonal transport defects and amyloid plaque formation remains to be clarified. Mutant PS1 can activate GSK3β, which in turn phosphorylates KLCs and promotes the release of kinesin-1 from its cargoes<sup>42</sup>.

It has been suggested that amyloid-β itself might cause fast axonal transport defects. In cultured hippocampal neurons, amyloid-β impairs the axonal transport of vesicles via the promotion of actin polymerization and aggregation; these effects are progressive and irreversible<sup>49</sup>. In the same cellular model, amyloid-β inhibits mitochondrial transport. This effect is mediated through an NMDA-type glutamate receptor-dependent mechanism and involves GSK3β activation, and it can be alleviated by treatment with an NMDA receptor antagonist or stimulation of the protein kinase A–cyclic AMP signalling pathway<sup>50,51</sup>. Perfusion of soluble oligomeric amyloid-β into isolated squid giant axoplasm inhibits bidirectional transport of vesicles by the activation of endogenous casein kinase 2 and further phosphorylation of KLCs<sup>52</sup>.

The effect of tau on motors is a subject of debate. Some studies have shown that monomeric tau can inhibit the anterograde transport of various cargoes — including APP<sup>53</sup> — by blocking the initial attachment of kinesin motor proteins to microtubules<sup>54,55</sup> and inhibiting kinesin motility along the microtubules<sup>34–36</sup>. Others studies have challenged this notion and have shown that the binding of tau to microtubules does not directly affect kinesin- or cytoplasmic dynein-based motility<sup>56</sup>.

REVIEWS

Box 1 | Methods for measuring axonal transport

Radioactive pulse-chase labelling with \[^{35}\]methionine has been the classic method to analyse the in vivo transport of cytoskeletal proteins along the sciatic nerve or the optic nerve of mice\(^{164}\). After injection of radioactive amino acids into the cell bodies of spinal motor neurons or retinal ganglion cells, the isotope emission allows newly synthesized proteins to be monitored as they travel within axons. From western blot analysis of the distance covered by radiolabelled proteins at different time intervals, the rate (but not the individual velocity) of their transport can be measured. This approach has been especially suitable for investigating the in vivo requirement of various intermediate filament proteins for intermediate filament assembly and transport into axons.

Video-enhanced contrast-differential interference contrast light microscopy has been used to study axonal transport in intact giant axons of the squid\(^{172}\). Successive photographs taken from video records allow the monitoring of various cargoes, including individual microtubules, small vesicles (30 nm in diameter) and mitochondria (5,000 nm in length). The extruded axoplasm of squid, a pure axonal compartment that is devoid of any perikaryon, is particularly valuable for the identification of the kinase- and phosphatase-mediated mechanisms that regulate axonal transport\(^{173}\).

The monitoring of fluorescent-labelled cargoes with time-lapse microscopy can be applied to embryonic cultured neurons that are derived from rodent models to study the direction, speed and frequency of pauses of individual cargoes (for example, neurofilaments, microtubules and mitochondria). Using this approach, axonal transport can be compared in neurons harbouring different gene mutations. Mitochondrial transport can be monitored in vivo by crossing a mouse model of interest with a transgenic mice expressing a mitochondria-targeted fluorescent protein\(^{174}\) or the photoconvertible fluorescent protein Kaede\(^{145}\). The photoconversion of a spatially restricted population of mitochondria allows tracking of the anterograde or retrograde movement of these individual photoconverted red organelles between their non-photoconverted green counterparts\(^{145}\).

A microfluidic culture platform allows the polarized growth of CNS axons in a fluidically isolated environment without neurotrophins. The embedded microgrooves define transport direction, which can be studied by live cell imaging. This method is suitable for analysing the trajectories and velocity of individual fluorescent elements. It also allows the investigation of axonal mRNA without detectable somal or dendritic contamination\(^{175}\). As cumulative evidence suggests that axonal protein synthesis is important in the development, maintenance and regeneration of axons\(^{175}\), this method could be valuable in studying the role of mRNA axonal transport and local protein synthesis in neurodegenerative diseases.

One in vitro retrograde transport assay is based on the C-terminal fragment of the tetanus neurotoxin (TeNT Hc). After being incubated in cultured neurons, this fragment is internalized at the axon tip and transported in a retrograde direction\(^{22}\). Transport of fluorescently labelled TeNT Hc is monitored by video tracking. This method can also be applied in living animals. The transport of fluorescent TeNT Hc can be monitored in vivo in the exposed sciatic nerve 6 hours after being injected in hindlimb muscles (namely, the gastrocnemius and tibialis anterior muscles) in mice\(^{117}\).

Manganese-enhanced MRI uses manganese chloride (\(\mathrm{MnCl}_2\)) as a contrast agent to follow axonal transport. The \(\mathrm{Mn}^{2+}\) ion is a calcium analogue that is taken up into neurons by voltage-gated calcium channels, packed into vesicles and transported down the axon by microtubule-based transport. This trans-synaptic tracer undergoes anterograde axonal transport in interconnected neurons and becomes distributed throughout the brain. \(\mathrm{Mn}^{2+}\) can be easily injected in olfactory epithelium to stain axonal transport of olfactory neurons. Fast multisliced T1 mapping allows successive MRI recordings (at multiple time points) over a short acquisition time. The method can be used to assess the overall integrity of axonal transport in living animals, and it has been used to show that axonal transport impairment occurs in mouse models of Alzheimer’s disease\(^{176}\).

Filamentous wild-type tau can inhibit transport. It does not act at the microtubule surface but activates PP1, which dephosphorylates and hence activates GSK3β, leading to the phosphorylation of KLCs and the release of kinesin from its cargoes\(^{57}\) (FIG. 2). The N-terminal phosphatase-activating domain of tau is responsible for triggering this pathway\(^{58}\). However, other studies have shown that there is no neuropathology and transport deficit in mice overexpressing some isoforms of wild-type tau\(^{37,59}\), suggesting that tau may only interfere with axonal transport when it is overexpressed at high levels or when its isoform composition or phosphorylation state is altered significantly\(^{37}\). Tau is also involved in microtubule stabilization. This function is strongly regulated by tau phosphorylation. Hyperphosphorylation of tau by GSK3β or CDK5–p25 kinase reduces its affinity for microtubules and its ability to promote microtubule filament assembly and modulates its ability to stabilize microtubules into organized arrays in vitro\(^{60,61}\) (FIG. 2). Strong reductions in tubulin acetylation and microtubule stabilization have been observed in neurons with neurofibrillary tangles in patients with Alzheimer’s disease\(^{62}\). Thus, in this disorder, hyperphosphorylated tau might destabilize axonal microtubules and in turn cause irreversible damage to the cytoskeleton\(^{60,61}\), ultimately resulting in neuronal degeneration. However, given the extreme dependence of all neuronal types on microtubules, it is unclear how this mechanism would explain the unique cellular pathology or the late age-of-onset nature of this disease.

Polyglutamine diseases. Polyglutamine (polyQ) diseases are inherited adult-onset neurodegenerative disorders. They are caused by the expansion of a CAG tract in particular genes, leading to the loss of selected neuronal populations through a dying-back neuropathy and the formation of aggregates that recruit and sequester essential cellular proteins. Of note, the length of the polyQ tract correlates with the age of symptom onset. Both Huntington’s disease and spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA; also known as Kennedy disease) — two well-known polyQ diseases — are associated with axonal transport defects.

Huntington’s disease is characterized by muscle incoordination, cognitive decline and dementia. It occurs when the number of CAG repeats in the coding region of the gene huntingtin (\(HTT\)) is above 36 (encoding so-called polyQ HTT)\(^{63}\). The characteristic degeneration of striatal and cortical neurons in mice expressing polyQ HTT is preceded by axonal pathology\(^{64}\), and axonal aggregates of polyQ HTT physically disrupt axonal transport in cultured neurons\(^{64}\) and in *Drosophila melanogaster*\(^{65}\). In addition, axonal transport impairment leading to vesicle accumulation has been documented in many experimental systems expressing polyQ HTT, including the squid giant axoplasm\(^{66}\), *D. melanogaster*\(^{67,68}\) and transgenic mice\(^{69}\). PolyQ HTT might impair axonal transport through inhibition of microtubule acetylation, activation of motor protein phosphorylation or loss of some normal HTT function (FIG. 2; TABLE 1).

One binding partner of HTT is HTT-associated protein 1 (HAP1), which interacts with KLC\(^{70}\) and DCTN1 (REF. 71). HTT can also directly bind to dynein intermediate chains and facilitates bidirectional vesicle motility\(^{72}\). HTT, HAP1 and dynactin take part in dynein-mediated intracellular trafficking of endosomes and lysosomes\(^{73}\) and in the retrograde transport of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)\(^{74}\). Thus, the loss of neurotrophic support, a defect in the clearance of lysosomal products

Figure 2 | Axonal transport damage in Alzheimer’s and Huntington’s diseases. **a,b** | In Alzheimer’s disease, axonal transport defects are due to defects in the proper organization of microtubules or in the binding of motor proteins to cargoes. Hyperphosphorylation (which is denoted by yellow circles) of tau by CDK5–p25 kinase or glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) leads to a decrease in the microtubule binding affinity of tau and destabilization of microtubules (**a**). GSK3β activation by tau, mutant presenilin 1 (PS1) or amyloid-β (Aβ) impairs cargo attachment to kinesin (**b**). Aβ also damages bidirectional axonal transport of vesicles through the activation of casein kinase 2 (CK2), which prevents cargoes from binding to the motor proteins (**b**). One of the cargoes that may be incorrectly transported in Alzheimer’s disease is the amyloid precursor protein. **c,d** | In Huntington’s disease, axonal transport defects are caused by disruption to the binding of the motor protein with microtubules or cargoes. Polyglutamine (polyQ) huntingtin promotes tubulin deacetylation, resulting in binding failure of the motor proteins to the microtubules. Histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) inhibitors can rescue tubulin acetylation and such binding (**c**). Microtubule binding of kinesin is also prevented by phosphorylation (which is denoted by yellow circles) of the kinesin motor domain by polyQ huntingtin-activated c-Jun N-terminal kinase 3 (JNK3). Huntingtin-associated protein 1 (HAP1) is an adaptor protein that interacts with kinesin light chains and dynactin subunit 1 (DCTN1). PolyQ huntingtin disrupts HAP1-mediated axonal transport, including that of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) (**d**). The loss of neurotrophic support may contribute to neurotoxicity in Huntington’s disease.

and/or impaired synaptic inhibition in the brain may contribute to neurotoxicity in Huntington’s disease. HTT, HAP1 and kinesin mediate transport of type A GABA receptors to synapses, and such transport is defective when HTT is mutated<sup>75</sup>. Together, these data suggest that a complex comprising HTT, HAP1, dynein–dynactin and kinesin is assembled on vesicles and may promote bidirectional transport in the cell<sup>72</sup>. Phosphorylation of HTT has been shown to promote anterograde vesicle motility, leading to the hypothesis that HTT may act as a switch to control the direction of vesicular movement along microtubules<sup>76</sup>.

Tubulin acetylation is a reversible post-translational modification that occurs at Lys40 at the N-terminal of α-tubulin. This modification facilitates kinesin docking onto microtubules, as mentioned above, and it is

prevented by histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) activity<sup>77</sup>. Tubulin acetylation is reduced in brain tissue from patients with Huntington’s disease compared with that from healthy controls<sup>78</sup>. Pharmacological treatment with HDAC6 inhibitors increases the acetylation of α-tubulin, the recruitment of dynein and kinesin-1 to microtubules and the transport of vesicles containing BDNF *in vitro*<sup>78</sup>. However, HDAC6 deletion increases tubulin acetylation but affects neither the transport efficiency of BDNF from the cortex to the striatum nor disease progression in a mouse model of Huntington’s disease<sup>79</sup>. As it has also been shown that HDAC6 and microtubules are essential for efficient autophagic degradation of misfolded HTT<sup>80</sup>, HDAC6 inhibition may not be a suitable therapeutic strategy for Huntington’s disease.

PolyQ HTT might also mediate its effects, in part, via JNK3. Activation of JNK3, which is expressed only in neurons, and not that of the ubiquitously expressed JNK1, has been observed to be an early event preceding disease onset in a mouse model of Huntington’s disease. JNK3 phosphorylates a conserved serine residue in the kinesin-1 motor domain and, as a consequence, reduces the binding affinity of kinesin-1 for microtubules<sup>81</sup> (FIG. 2).

SBMA, a neurodegenerative disease that is characterized by lower motor neuron degeneration, is caused by a polyQ expansion (above 40 glutamine residues) in the androgen receptor (AR) protein. Male patients with this disorder present with progressive proximal muscle atrophy that is sometimes associated with bulbar defects (dysarthria and dysphagia). AR is a transcription factor that translocates to the nucleus following the binding of androgens. The expression of polyQ AR caused abnormal mitochondrial and kinesin distribution in transfected cells<sup>82</sup> and inhibited fast axonal transport in squid axoplasm in a transcription-independent manner<sup>66</sup> through a pathway involving JNK3–stress-activated protein kinase 1b (SAPK1B; also known as MAPK10) activation, phosphorylation of KHCs by JNK, and inhibition of kinesin-1 binding to microtubules<sup>83</sup> (TABLE 1). Mice expressing human AR with an expanded polyQ tract showed reduced levels of unphosphorylated neurofilament heavy chain (NFH) in motor neurons<sup>84</sup> and an increased level of neurofilaments at the distal motor neuron ends<sup>85</sup>, suggesting a role for these intermediate filaments in SBMA-linked neuronal dysfunction. Studies involving tetanus toxin tracking revealed that these mice did not show retrograde transport abnormalities *in vitro* and *in vivo*<sup>86</sup>, although they did exhibit progressive motor neuron decline and intranuclear inclusions in neurons<sup>84</sup>.

**Hereditary spastic paraplegia.** Hereditary spastic paraplegias (HSPs) are clinically heterogeneous inherited upper motor neuron diseases that are characterized by progressive spasticity and pyramidal weakness, with predominant presentation in the legs. These symptoms occur in the absence (pure HSP) or the presence (complicated HSP) of other neurological signs. Neuropathological studies have shown that, in HSPs, dying-back axonal degeneration occurs in the corticospinal tracts and the dorsal columns.

Numerous HSP-associated genes encode proteins that are involved in axonal transport and intracellular trafficking, which underlines the vulnerability of long motor neuron axons to alterations in these processes<sup>87,88</sup> (TABLE 2). Indeed, these observations unequivocally demonstrate that defective intracellular transport can directly trigger motor neuron degeneration.

Mutations in SPAST (also known as SPG4), the gene encoding spastin, are responsible for 40% of autosomal dominant forms of HSP<sup>89</sup>. Point mutations and large deletions of SPAST have been associated with HSP, indicating that mutant spastin has a dominant negative effect or exhibits a loss of function. *Spast*-knockout mice show progressive axonal swelling and accumulation of organelles and neurofilaments, suggesting that these animals have an impairment in axonal transport<sup>90</sup>. Spastin contains a microtubule-interacting and endosomal-trafficking (MIT) domain, other microtubule-interacting regions and an ATPase with various cellular activities (AAA) domain, and it acts to regulate microtubule dynamics. Wild-type spastin severs microtubules by destabilizing tubulin–tubulin interactions<sup>91</sup> and bundles microtubules *in vitro*<sup>92</sup>. Severing is essential for axonal transport of microtubules, and fine regulation of severing and bundling is essential for microtubule homeostasis. Mutant spastin has a reduced microtubule-severing activity and is mislocalized on axonal microtubules, causing a subsequent mislocalization of mitochondria. These findings suggest that mutant spastin interferes with kinesin-mediated transport along microtubules<sup>93</sup> (FIG. 3a). However, the contribution of spastin-based severing *in vivo* remains unknown, and it has been suggested that HSP-related forms of spastin inhibit axonal transport through a novel gain-of-function, microtubule-independent mechanism that involves activation of the kinases and phosphatases that regulate molecular motor proteins<sup>94</sup>.

Several HSP-linked proteins are involved in endosome trafficking. Spastin interacts with charged multivesicular body protein 1b (CHMP1B), which is a protein associated with the endosomal sorting complex that is required for the transport III complex<sup>95</sup>. Mutant spastin might impair proper CHMP1B function. HSP mutations have also been found in ATL1 and zinc finger FYVE domain-containing 27 (ZFYVE27); these genes encode atlastin 1 and protrudin, respectively, which are two other partners of spastin. Mutant atlastin 1 and protrudin might cause HSP by affecting normal spastin biology and/or impeding endosomal function. Other HSP-linked proteins that also take part in endosome trafficking include: spastizin (which is encoded by ZFYVE26), spartin (which is encoded by KIAA0610; also known as spastic paraplegia 20 (SPG20)), maspardin (which is encoded by ACP33; also known as SPG21), magnesium transporter NIPA1 (non-imprinted in Prader–Willi/Angelman syndrome region protein 1) and receptor expression-enhancing protein 1 (which is encoded by REEP1). The fact that these HSP-linked proteins are all involved in endosome trafficking suggests that this process is crucial for upper motor neuron survival<sup>87</sup>.

Further evidence for a role for axonal transport defects in HSP came from the discovery of a clinically complicated form of HSP that is associated with spasticity, cognitive impairment, lower motor neuron degeneration and severe neuropathy. This form of HSP is caused by mutations in SPG11 (REF. 96), and ultrastructural analysis of sural nerve biopsy samples from patients with SPG11-linked disease detected an accumulation of pleomorphic membranous material, suggesting that the long-projecting neurons had defective axonal transport⁹⁷.

Mutations in KIF5A have been identified in dominant forms of HSP. Most of these are missense mutations that affect the motor domain of the protein. The mutant variants of KIF5A either have a reduction in microtubule affinity or exhibit a reduction in transport velocity *in vitro*⁹⁸ (FIG. 3), and postnatal disruption of *Kif5a* in conditional knockout mice leads to a reduction in neurofilament axonal transport, animal paralysis and neurodegeneration⁸. Interestingly, a mutation in *KIF5A* has also been found in a patient with Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease type 2 (CMT2). Thus, these findings suggest that *KIF5A*-related forms of HSP and CMT2 may be extreme phenotypes that result from mutations in the same gene⁹⁹ and represent the limits of a sort of continuum between these diseases that affect neurons with long axons.

Three HSP-linked genes — REEP1, HSP60 and SPG7 — encode proteins with mitochondrial functions. Mice deficient in paraplegin, which is encoded by SPG7, accumulate hypertrophic mitochondria in distal axons before developing axonal spheroids that contain neurofilaments and organelles, suggesting that these animals have impairment of both slow and fast anterograde axonal transport¹⁰⁰. A neurotracer study in the peripheral nerve of these mice also showed a retrograde transport delay in neurons with the longest axons¹⁰⁰. Defective ATP synthesis and reduction of mitochondrial complex I activity are also seen in later stages of the disease in these mice¹⁰⁰. Thus, a deficiency in the mitochondrial ATPase paraplegin affects all types of axonal transport.

**Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease.** CMT is the most common hereditary neuropathy and is characterized by weakness and atrophy of distal muscle and mild sensory loss. The disease is classified into two clinical subtypes that are based on differences in motor nerve conduction velocity. In CMT1, motor nerve conduction velocity is markedly reduced owing to myelin degeneration (myelinopathy), whereas in CMT2, it is only slightly subnormal and is caused by axonal degeneration (axonopathy)¹⁰¹.

Numerous mutations in the gene encoding mitochondrial fusion protein mitofusin 2 (MFN2) have been reported to be associated with CMT2A (one of several subtypes of CMT2)¹⁰². MFN2 is a mitochondrial outer membrane GTPase that regulates the fusion of mitochondria and the mitochondrial network architecture. The aforementioned CMT2A-linked mutations comprise substitutions within or adjacent to the region encoding the MFN2 GTPase motif. Motor neurons of transgenic mice expressing mutant MFN2 have highly aggregated mitochondria that cluster along the axon and are

Figure 3 | Axonal transport damage in motor neuron diseases and peripheral axonopathies.  
a | In hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP), disease mutations can affect the function of the kinesin motor protein KIF5A or spastin protein. Microtubule severing by spastin facilitates the axonal transport of microtubules, whereas microtubule bundling impairs such transport.  
b | In Charcot–Marie–Tooth (CMT) disease, a mutation in the gene encoding heat shock factor protein β1 (HSBP1) induces microtubule deacetylation, which is rescued by inhibitors of histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6). Assembly and transport of neurofilaments are disrupted by mutant HSBP1 and mutant neurofilament light chain (NFL). A CMT-associated mitofusin 2 (MFN2) mutant variant disrupts the binding of kinesin adaptor protein with mitochondria.  
c | In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), mutations affecting dynein complex proteins (such as dynactin subunit 1 (DCTN1)) impair microtubule-based axonal transport. Activation of multiple kinases seems to be involved in ALS axonal transport impairment. Glutamate activates c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), which phosphorylates the kinesin motor domain and inhibits kinesin from binding to microtubules (phosphorylation is represented by the yellow circles). Glutamate and ALS-linked mutant superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) activate p38 and the resulting phosphorylation of kinesin light chain inhibits cargo from binding to the motor protein. Glutamate and mutant SOD1 activate p38 and CDK5–p25 kinase, which phosphorylate neurofilaments and prevent neurofilament from binding to the motor protein.

increased in the distal part of the nerve ${ }^{103,104}$. Moreover, in cultured neurons, the expression of CMT2A-associated MFN2 mutants disrupts both anterograde and retrograde mitochondrial transport, although it does not alter the transport of other organelles ${ }^{105,106}$. Embryonic fibroblasts derived from $M f n 2$-knockout mice have a defect in mitochondria movement ${ }^{107}$, and oxidative phosphorylation is impaired in brain mitochondria of transgenic mice expressing a mutant form of human MFN2 (REF. 108). MFN2 interacts with adaptor molecules that link mitochondria to kinesins and the mutant forms of MFN2 disrupt the proper function of these complexes ${ }^{106}$ (FIG. 3; TABLE 2), indicating a mechanism by which MFN2 causes mitochondrial defects.

Mutations affecting $T B C 1 D 15$ (TBC1 domain family member 15), which encodes GTPase-activating protein RAB7, have been identified in cases of CMT2B ${ }^{101}$. RAB7 regulates endosomal and lysosomal retrograde transport, and mediates the retrograde transport of neurotrophins and their receptors ${ }^{109}$.

Mutations in $N E F L$, which encodes NFL, have been identified in patients with autosomal dominant CMT2E ${ }^{101}$. Mutant NFL can disrupt neurofilament assembly and transport (FIG. 3; TABLE 2), and neurofilament accumulations in the initial axonal segment can sequester mitochondria and impair anterograde and retrograde transport of other cargoes ${ }^{110,111}$.

Dominant mutations in the gene encoding heat shock protein $\beta 1$ (HSPB1) cause CMT2F ${ }^{101}$. HSPB1, like other small heat shock proteins, binds to misfolded proteins to prevent their aggregation. Mutant HSPB1 disrupts the cellular distribution and promotes the aggregation of NFL, neurofilament medium chain (NFM) and dynactin ${ }^{112,113}$. Expression of mutant HSPB1 in mice leads to a CMT-like phenotype and severe axonal transport defects owing to a reduction in acetylated tubulin levels ${ }^{114}$. Pharmacological inhibition of HDAC6 activity in these mice rescued the axonal transport defects and the CMT phenotype of these animals ${ }^{114}$. These results show that impairment of tubulin acetylation can induce axonal transport defects and highlight the potential therapeutic use of HDAC6 inhibitors in certain neurodegenerative conditions (FIG. 3).

Recently, a mutation in $D Y N C 1 H 1$ affecting a highly conserved residue within the homodimerization domain was identified in a large dominant pedigree with CMT2O ${ }^{115}$. Studies have shown that three mouse models — Legs at odd angles, Cramping 1 and Sprawling mice — with different point mutations in the region coding for this domain in $D y n c l h 1$, arising from N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea or radiation-induced mutagenesis, exhibit age-related progressive loss of locomotor ability and sensory neuropathy without a major reduction in lifespan ${ }^{116-118}$. These animals all show impaired retrograde transport and striatal atrophy, which seem to underlie the motor decline ${ }^{116,117}$.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) — the most common adult-onset motor neuron disease — is characterized by the degeneration of cortical, bulbar and spinal motor neurons.

This degeneration induces progressive muscle wasting, paralysis and spasticity that ultimately lead to respiratory failure. Electron microscopy studies have revealed that swellings occur in the initial segment of motor axons in patients with ALS and that these swellings contain vesicles, lysosomes, mitochondria and intermediate filaments ${ }^{119,120}$. These changes are highly suggestive of axonal transport defects. Excitotoxicity, a phenomenon associated with ALS ${ }^{121}$, may contribute to transport defects in this disorder. Glutamate can activate JNK, p38 (also known as adaptor molecule crk) and CDK5–p25 kinase ${ }^{65,122,123}$ and slow down axonal transport of fluorescently tagged neurofilaments in primary neurons through increased phosphorylation of neurofilament side-arm domains ${ }^{122}$ (FIG. 3; TABLE 3). Moreover, phosphorylation of KHC (by JNK activation) and KLC (by p38) inhibits the binding of kinesin to microtubules and cargoes, respectively ${ }^{83,124}$ (FIG. 3).

Neurofilament side-arm phosphorylation results in increased neurofilament pausing ${ }^{31,122}$ (FIG. 3). There is evidence to show that abnormal phosphorylation of neurofilament proteins may be a susceptibility factor for ALS. Codon deletions and insertions in the phosphorylation repeat domain of $N E F H$ (which encodes NFH) have been identified in some cases of sporadic ALS ${ }^{125-127}$. A peripherin gene frameshift mutation that disrupts neurofilament assembly has also been reported in sporadic ALS ${ }^{128}$.

Alterations in the stoichiometry of neurofilament subunits and microtubule disorganization can cause defective axonal transport. Overexpression of wild-type NFL, NFH, peripherin or mutant NFL in mice causes motor neuron dysfunction, axonal atrophy and perikaryal accumulations of neurofilaments ${ }^{129-131}$. Recently, transgenic mice expressing ALS-linked mutations in the gene encoding TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP43) were found to exhibit an upregulation of peripherin expression together with an NFL deficiency ${ }^{132}$. These changes in intermediate filament organization had been previously reported to cause a net retrograde transport of mitochondria ${ }^{6}$. TDP43 binds to the 3′ UTR region of $N E F L$ mRNA, colocalizes with stress granules and processing bodies containing $N E F L$ mRNA ${ }^{133}$ and regulates splicing variant levels of peripherin ${ }^{132}$, suggesting that it has a role in mRNA processing of intermediate filament proteins.

Mutations in superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) can cause familial and sporadic ALS. Transgenic mice overexpressing a mutant form of SOD1 (variants with a G93A, G37R or G85R mutation) develop an ALS-like disease ${ }^{134-136}$, and slow axonal transport is impaired in these animals before the onset of clinical symptoms ${ }^{137,138}$. Various types of kinases are activated in SOD1 ${ }^{\mathrm{G} 37 \mathrm{R}}$ and SOD1 ${ }^{\mathrm{G} 93 \mathrm{~A}}$ mutant mice (including p38 (REFS 65, 139) and CDK5–p25 kinase ${ }^{140}$) that could be involved in the slowing of neurofilament axonal transport (FIG. 3; TABLE 2). Vesicle motility assays in isolated squid axoplasm have revealed that mutant SOD1 ${ }^{\mathrm{H} 46 \mathrm{R}}$ mice can inhibit kinesin-based axonal transport via p38 activation ${ }^{141}$ and that antibodies against misfolded SOD1 were able to restore normal axonal transport in

this *in vitro* system. In the future, it would be of interest to determine whether such anti-SOD1 antibodies are able to rescue axonal transport defects in ALS mice expressing mutant SOD1.

Time-lapse microscopy on cultured motor neurons from SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice showed that mitochondrial transport is reduced in the anterograde direction but is enhanced in the retrograde direction, resulting in a 50% depletion in the number of mitochondria in axons<sup>142</sup>. In axons of SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice expressing fluorescently tagged mitochondria, these organelles spend more time pausing during anterograde and retrograde transport<sup>117</sup>, and the distribution of mitochondria is disrupted in SOD1<sup>G85R</sup> and SOD1<sup>G37R</sup> mice<sup>143</sup>. This phenomenon could be due to the hyperactivation of p38, which phosphorylates KLCs<sup>124</sup> (FIG. 3), or to the binding of misfolded SOD1 onto the cytoplasmic face of the mitochondria<sup>143</sup>. However, the depletion of axon-targeted syntaphilin — a docking receptor that specifically immobilizes axonal mitochondria to rescue the mobile state and the density of axonal mitochondria in SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice — did not affect motor neuron function or lifespan, suggesting that impairment of mitochondrial transport may be not the direct cause of motor neuron degeneration<sup>144</sup>. Another study arguing against the role of defective mitochondria transport in causing ALS showed that deficits in such transport are neither necessary nor sufficient to cause motor neuron degeneration in mice overexpressing wild-type SOD1 (SOD1<sup>WT</sup> model) or in the SOD1<sup>G85R</sup> mouse model and that alterations in axonal transport of mitochondria were dissociated from axonal degeneration<sup>145</sup>. Indeed, no transport deficits were found in the SOD1<sup>G85R</sup> model despite the presence of ongoing axon degeneration. Moreover, transport deficits have been shown to occur in the absence of neurodegeneration in the SOD1<sup>WT</sup> mouse model<sup>145</sup>. This finding underlines the remarkable capability of motor neurons to survive for long periods of time despite limited axonal transport. This study further showed that severe transport deficits occurred a long time before any axon degeneration or drop in axonal mitochondria density in the SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> and SOD1<sup>G37R</sup> models, suggesting the existence of some sort of compensatory mechanism<sup>145</sup>. From this study, it remains possible that disturbed transport of another cargo would better correlate with ALS-related motor neuron degeneration.

Defects in retrograde axonal transport occur before other pathology can be observed in mouse models of ALS. The direct visualization of retrograde axonal transport of fluorescent tetanus toxin in SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice showed that this process was slowed down *in vitro*<sup>146</sup> and *in vivo*<sup>117</sup> compared with this process in wild-type mice. Disruption of the dynein–dynactin complex affects motor neuron function. Postnatal transgenic overexpression of DCTN2 in mouse motor neurons causes neurodegeneration that is due to the selective impairment of retrograde transport<sup>147</sup>. In humans, mutations in *DCTN1* result in a particular form of inherited, slowly progressive motor neuron disease with onset of vocal cord paralysis<sup>148</sup>. In mice, expression of mutant DCTN1 provokes the loss of motor neurons and the accumulation of neurofilaments, vesicles (including autophagosomes) and ubiquitin<sup>149–151</sup> (FIG. 3; TABLE 2). However, defects in axonal transport are not evident in this mouse model, and pathogenesis could result from other noxious effects of mutant DCTN1, such as induction of proliferation of degradative organelles and destabilization of neuromuscular junctions<sup>151</sup>.

Neuron-specific overexpression of the N terminus of the motor adaptor protein bicaudal D in mice has been studied to determine the consequences of disrupting dynein–dynactin complex function. Although this truncated protein strongly binds to this complex, these mice showed no motor neuron degeneration despite impairment of axonal transport, giant neurofilament swelling and Golgi fragmentation<sup>152</sup>. Thus, partial inhibition of dynein–dynactin complex functions does not necessarily lead to motor neuron degeneration. Together, these studies show that, similar to partial impairment of anterograde transport, mild disruption of retrograde axonal transport may not be lethal.

REVIEW S

Vesicle trafficking impairment could also have a role in ALS motor neuron degeneration. Mutations in ALS2 (which encodes alsin) and VAPB (vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP)-associated protein B/C) have been identified in rare forms of ALS. Alsin is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for RAB5. This small GTPase is involved in retrograde transport of endosomes<sup>153</sup>, a process that is disrupted in Als2-knockout mice<sup>154,155</sup>. VAPB is an integral endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein that recruits lipid-binding proteins such as membrane-associated phosphatidylinositol transfer proteins (also known as N-terminal domain-interacting receptor protein (NIR)) to anchor them onto the endoplasmic reticulum<sup>156,157</sup> (TABLE 2).

**Parkinson’s disease.** Parkinson’s disease is characterized by the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, which causes rigidity, shaking and gait disturbance. The typical hallmark lesions of the disease are the Lewy body inclusions, which are composed of hyperphosphorylated α-synuclein. Mutations in the gene encoding α-synuclein (SNCA) cause familial autosomal dominant Parkinson’s disease, and the disruption of α-synuclein transport may contribute to the accumulation of this protein in familial and sporadic forms of the disease. Indeed, axonal transport analysis in cultured neurons reveals that missense mutations associated with familial forms of the disease or point mutations mimicking permanent phosphorylation of α-synuclein similarly slow down the axonal movement of this protein<sup>158</sup>.

Three other genes associated with familial forms of Parkinson’s disease encode proteins that are involved in maintenance of mitochondria function, which provides energy for axonal transport: PARK2 (Parkinson’s disease protein 2), which encodes the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase parkin, PINK1 (PTEN-induced putative kinase 1), which encodes the serine/threonine-protein kinase PINK1, and PARK7, which encodes the protein DJ-1 (REF. 159) (TABLE 2). Mitochondrial impairment at complex I caused by neurotoxins, such as 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), its metabolite 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) or the pesticide rotenone, can induce Parkinsonism (TABLE 3). Axonal transport was studied in these models of neurotoxin-induced Parkinsonism. MPP+ increases dynein-mediated retrograde and decreases kinesin-dependent anterograde transport of vesicles in isolated squid axoplasm through the activation of caspase 3 and PKCδ<sup>160</sup>. As these transport impairments are accompanied by a loss of synaptic membranous organelles in presynaptic terminals, they have been proposed to be responsible for the altered synaptic function and the primary cause of the dying-back pathology that occurs during Parkinson’s disease<sup>160</sup>. In the rotenone chronic exposure model of Parkinson’s disease, the retrograde transport rate of mitochondria was increased (TABLE 3). However, the increased rate of transport is due to a higher proportion of mobile mitochondria showing few pauses rather than to an increase in the velocity of transport<sup>161</sup>.

Mutations in *DCTN1* were identified in eight unrelated families with Perry syndrome, a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by early-onset Parkinsonism, depression, severe weight loss and hypoventilation that ultimately leads to respiratory insufficiency<sup>162</sup>. The mutations lie within or adjacent to the region encoding the GKNDG binding motif of N-terminal cytoskeleton-associated protein-glycine-rich (CAP-Gly) domain and cause decreased microtubule binding and, ultimately, intracytoplasmic inclusion accumulation. This suggests that these mutations might destabilize the dynactin complex, leading to impaired misfolded protein clearance and/or aggregation<sup>162</sup>.

Analysis of post-mortem patient brains showed that kinesin and cytoplasmic dynein subunit levels are decreased in sporadic Parkinson’s disease, with kinesin levels being affected early on in the disorder, before dopaminergic loss<sup>163</sup>. These features were recapitulated in rats with viral overexpression of human mutant α-synuclein<sup>163</sup>. This study strongly supports the notion that neurodegeneration involves axonal transport disruption in Parkinson’s disease.

**Conclusions and perspectives**

Many neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by adult-onset, progressive accumulations of specific proteins in different types of neurons. Whether such protein accumulations are the cause or the consequence of axonal transport defects is a subject of debate. It is commonly assumed that disturbances in axonal transport are key pathological events that contribute to neurodegeneration. However, the causal relationship between axonal transport disturbances and degeneration remains unclear.

The identification of mutations in genes encoding proteins that are known to be involved in axonal transport strongly support the view that defective intracellular transport can directly trigger neurodegeneration. The observation that chronic exposure to some chemicals can provoke axonal transport disturbances and subsequent neurodegeneration further supports the notion that axonal transport defects contribute to disease. For example, several industrial compounds can impair the axonal transport of neurofilament proteins through a direct interaction with neurofilaments and protein crosslinking, improper phosphorylation of these proteins or altering the electrical charge of the neurofilament cargoes. Some of these compounds, such as ββ′-iminodipropionitrile (IDPN) and aluminium salts, cause proximal axonal enlargements and delayed axonal transport, whereas others, such as 2,5-hexanedione and carbon disulphide industrial solvents, produce distal neurofilament accumulations, with accelerated transport of the neurofilament proteins<sup>164</sup> (TABLE 3). However, a recent report showed that the mechanisms that impair organelle transport are distinct from those that initiate axon degeneration in ALS mouse models and therefore suggested that organelle transport deficits might accelerate rather than cause axon degeneration in this disease<sup>145</sup>. Of course, in certain cases, defects in axonal transport might be a consequence of the accumulation of aggregated proteins and/or have a minimal role in neurodegeneration.
There is evidence to suggest that some disorders are associated with a number of axonal transport impairments. But how could different axonal transport defects selectively affect the same neuronal type in a given disease? It is possible that various axonal transport insults could lead to a convergent neurodegenerative pathway that affects the most vulnerable neurons. An example of this is provided by an Alzheimer’s disease mouse model that couples the conditional knockout of PS1 with the transgenic expression of wild-type tau<sup>165</sup>. These mice have accelerated axonal transport impairments and neurodegeneration compared with single transgenic mice, suggesting an additive effect of the dysfunction of these two proteins. Of course, it is also conceivable that the multiple axonal transport defects that are observed for a given disease are associated with an unobserved common axonal transport impairment that is specific to the type of affected neurons.

In some cases, different mutations in the same gene (for example, those in *DCTN1*) can affect different neuronal types (that is, motor neurons or dopaminergic neurons for *DCTN1* mutations)<sup>148,162</sup>. Indeed, even though different *DCTN1* mutations are located in the CAP-Gly domain of DCTN1 and cause comparable decreases in microtubule binding, they give rise to clinically and pathologically distinct neurodegenerative disorders (lower motor neuron disease or Perry syndrome)<sup>162</sup>. The subtle differences of these mutations on axonal transport function are now important to resolve, as they may underlie the selective vulnerability of distinct neuronal populations in these different neurodegenerative diseases.

The studies discussed here indicate that axonal transport deficits might arise through various mechanisms that may act synergistically. Loss-of-function mutations in motor proteins may result in the degeneration of specific neuronal populations and lead to motor neuron diseases or Perry syndrome. However, such mutations are rare and have not been linked with other neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and polyQ-expansion diseases. Alternatively, accumulated evidence suggests that altered kinase activities may compromise and dysregulate axonal transport in ALS<sup>65,122–124,139,140</sup>, Huntington’s<sup>66</sup>, SBMA<sup>66,83</sup> and Alzheimer’s disease<sup>25,42</sup>.

Direct interactions of mutant or misfolded proteins with components of the axonal transport machinery might interfere with motor–cargo binding, initiating a dying-back neuropathy, as basic neuronal functions and trophic factor dependent survival all rely on appropriate axonal transport efficiency. Furthermore, the stalling of vesicles could trigger the formation of aggregates within axons that may initiate a cascade of events resulting in neuronal dysfunction and death. Other targets of toxic proteins are mitochondria, which are sources of cellular energy. Mitochondrial dysfunction that leads to energetic breakdown can severely affect the axonal transport of other cargoes. This scheme seems to be particularly relevant for Parkinson’s disease, although it may apply to all neurodegenerative disorders; in an ALS mouse model, impairment of mitochondria transport did not directly trigger neurodegeneration<sup>144,145</sup>. However, other aspects of mitochondrial damage (such as membrane conductance and calcium homeostasis dysfunction) have been suggested to contribute to motor neuron loss in ALS<sup>144</sup>.

Autophagy, which involves degradation and recycling of cellular components, could also take part in axonal transport deficiency. Impairment of lysosomal proteolysis through either inhibition of cathepsin activity or suppression of lysosomal acidification was shown to slow down the axonal transport of endosomes, lysosomes and autolysosomes, which accumulate in dystrophic neuritic swellings<sup>166</sup>. Thus, it has been proposed that neuronal lysosomal proteolysis is the basis for axonal transport deficits in Alzheimer’s disease<sup>166</sup> and might be important for other neurodegenerative diseases.

The interaction between axonal transport and metabolism of RNA merits further attention. Dysfunction of these processes has recently become an appealing hypothesis for the mechanism underlying ALS. A repeat expansion in the non-coding region of *C9ORF72* has recently been discovered as being a major genetic cause of ALS and frontotemporal dementia<sup>167</sup>. In addition, mutations in genes encoding the RNA-binding proteins TDP43 and FUS are responsible for subsets of ALS cases<sup>88</sup>. Transgenic mice overexpressing *TARDBP* genomic fragments exhibited an age-related reduction in NFL levels and ALS-like peripherin accumulations, both of which could be alleviated by inhibition of nuclear factor κB (NFκB) activation<sup>132,168</sup>. TDP43 and FUS aggregate and associate with stress granules, which are a type of RNA granule generated under stress conditions to modulate RNA translation. RNA granules colocalize with neuropathology in human brains affected by Alzheimer’s disease<sup>169</sup>, suggesting that RNA granule formation might participate in neurodegeneration in other neurodegenerative diseases. Interestingly, tau can directly interact with RNA<sup>170</sup> and HTT has been proven to play a part in RNA granule transport<sup>171</sup>. Whether mRNA axonal transport to the synapse is impaired in neurodegenerative diseases remains to be studied.

Are axonal transport defects suitable therapeutic targets in neurodegenerative diseases? Attempts to increase mitochondrial transport failed to confer therapeutic effects in SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice<sup>144</sup>, which is in line with the absence of a correlation between mitochondria transport and neurodegeneration in this ALS mouse model<sup>145</sup>. However, in diseases linked to axonal transport deficits, such as CMT, a pharmacological approach to increase tubulin acetylation by HDAC6 inhibitors has succeeded in correcting the axonal transport defects and rescuing disease-related phenotypes in models of the disorder<sup>114</sup>. Other pharmacological approaches, such as drugs that target the activities of protein kinases, might have applications in correcting axonal transport defects and attenuating neurodegeneration. Future studies should determine whether such therapeutic strategies might be applicable to neurodegenerative diseases.
