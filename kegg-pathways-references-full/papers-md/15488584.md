## Abstract

The metabolism of biphenyl, naphthalene, anthracene, phenanthrene, pyrene and benzo[a]pyrene by *Cyclothyrium* sp. CBS 109850, a coelomycete isolated for the first time in Brazil from industrially polluted estuarine sediment, was studied. The metabolites were extracted and separated by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and characterized by UV spectral analyses and mass, and proton nuclear magnetic resonance ($^1$H NMR) spectrometry. *Cyclothyrium* sp. transformed biphenyl to 4-hydroxybiphenyl and anthracene to anthracene trans-1,2-dihydrodiol. This isolate metabolized 90% of [9-$^{14}$C]phenanthrene, producing phenanthrene trans-9,10-dihydrodiol as a major metabolite, phenanthrene trans-3,4-dihydrodiol, 1-hydroxyphenanthrene, 3-hydroxyphenanthrene, 4-hydroxyphenanthrene, and a novel metabolite, 2-hydroxy-7-methoxyphenanthrene. Circular dichroism spectra analyses indicated that the major enantiomers of phenanthrene trans-9, 10-dihydrodiol, phenanthrene trans-3,4-dihydrodiol and pyrene trans-4,5-dihydrodiol, a pyrene metabolite produced previously by *Cyclothyrium* sp. CBS 109850, were predominantly in the $(R,R)$ configuration, revealing a high stereoselectivity for initial monooxygenation and enzymatic hydration of phenanthrene and pyrene by *Cyclothyrium* sp. CBS 109850. The results also show a high regioselectivity since the K-regions of phenanthrene and pyrene were the major sites of metabolism.

## 1. Introduction

Fungi play an important role in the metabolism of many chemicals, including aromatic hydrocarbons, in aquatic and terrestrial environments ([Müncnerová and Augustin, 1994](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2004.07.051); [Cerniglia and Sutherland, 2001](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2004.07.051)).

Fungal oxidation of aromatic hydrocarbons results in the production of metabolites with higher aqueous solubility and generally less biological reactivity than the

parent compounds (Cerniglia and Sutherland, 2001). Further degradation of these metabolites is achieved abiotically or by other microorganisms (Launen et al., 1999). Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) oxidation by non-ligninolytic and some ligninolytic fungi to form trans-dihydrodiols occurs by cytochrome P-450 monooxygenase and epoxide hydrolase-catalyzed reactions (Sutherland et al., 1995; Bezalel et al., 1996b). These P-450 and epoxide hydrolase reactions are highly stereoselective resulting in enantiomers with different biological properties. The metabolites could be innocuous or responsible for adverse genotoxic effects (Armstrong et al., 1993; Shou et al., 1994). Nevertheless, most fungal metabolites produced from aromatic hydrocarbons are less toxic than the parent compounds (Cerniglia and Sutherland, 2001).

The reintroduction of indigenous microorganisms isolated from contaminated sites after culturing has been shown to be a highly effective bioremediation strategy (Korda et al., 1997). Different groups of filamentous fungi were isolated from PAH contaminated estuarine sediments collected from a very polluted Brazilian location (da Silva et al., 2003a). After studying pyrene degradation of these fungi, some of them were selected as pyrene degraders. The most efficient, *Cyclothyrium* sp. CBS 109850, transformed 48% of pyrene, producing several metabolites (da Silva et al., 2003b). *Cyclothyrium* sp. is an anamorphic ascomycete, belonging to the coelomycetes (Sutton, 1980). There is no previous report on the isolation of this fungus in Brazil, nor are there studies on pollutant degradation by *Cyclothyrium* sp. (da Silva et al., 2003b).

This paper describes the ability of *Cyclothyrium* sp. CBS 109850 to oxidize aromatic hydrocarbon compounds with different molecular weights and the identification of the resultant metabolites. Furthermore, absolute stereochemistry of phenanthrene and pyrene trans-dihydrodiols produced by *Cyclothyrium* sp. were determined.

## 2. Materials and methods

### 2.1. Chemicals

Unlabeled biphenyl was purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO), naphthalene from Fisher Scientific Co. (Pittsburgh, PA), and anthracene, phenanthrene, pyrene and benzo[a]pyrene from Aldrich Chemical Co. (Milwaukee, WI). All were more than 97% pure. [9-¹⁴C]Phenanthrene (8.3 mCi mmol⁻¹; radiochemical purity, ≥99%) was obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. Dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) was purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. 4,4′-Dihydroxybiphenyl, 4-hydroxybiphenyl, 3-hydroxybiphenyl and 2-hydroxybiphenyl were purchased from Aldrich Chemical Co. All solvents were of HPLC grade.

### 2.2. Microorganism

*Cyclothyrium* sp. CBS 109850 was isolated from estuarine sediment contaminated by a variety of industrial pollutants and by PAHs (da Silva et al., 2003a). This isolate was selected based on its ability to metabolize pyrene (da Silva et al., 2003b). The fungus was maintained on potato dextrose agar plates and on 2% malt agar slants and stored at 4°C. The isolate is deposited in Centraalbureau voor Schimmelcultures (CBS, Utrecht, The Netherlands).

### 2.3. Culture conditions and extraction of metabolites

Spores and mycelia were aseptically inoculated into 125 ml Erlenmeyer flasks containing 30 ml of Sabouraud dextrose broth (SDB). The flasks were incubated for 48 h at 30°C on a rotary shaker at 150 rpm. After 48 h of incubation, 2 mg of biphenyl, naphthalene, anthracene, phenanthrene, pyrene or 1 mg of benzo[a]pyrene was dissolved in 0.5 ml of dimethylsulfoxide and added to separate flasks. Control experiments were performed by incubating each of the aromatic hydrocarbons in autoclaved cultures (121°C for 40 min) and by incubating SDB medium with a test aromatic hydrocarbon without inoculum. All assays were conducted in duplicate. Before incubation, a flask of each treatment was selected for immediate extraction. All remaining flasks were incubated for 96 h, except for the cultures with anthracene and benzo[a]-pyrene, which were incubated for 192 h. The culture broth was blended with ethyl acetate for 10 s to extract the aromatic hydrocarbons and metabolites from the mycelia. The ethyl acetate extraction procedure was as described by Pothuluri et al. (1990).

### 2.4. Detection of aromatic hydrocarbons and metabolites

Metabolites and parent compounds were separated by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), performed on a Hewlett-Packard 1050 series system equipped with a Hewlett-Packard 1050 series diode array detector (Hewlett-Packard, Palo Alto, CA) operating at 254 nm and fitted with a 4.6 × 250 mm 5 μm C₁₈ Spherisorb ODS-2 column (MetaChem Technologies, Torrance, CA). A 40 min linear gradient of methanol–water (30:70 to 95:5 [vol/vol]) at a flow rate of 1.0 ml min⁻¹ eluted the compounds. UV absorbance spectra were obtained using the diode array detector.

### 2.5. Radioisotope experiments

Incubations were performed as described above using [9-¹⁴C]phenanthrene (1.0 μCi) and 2 mg of unlabeled phenanthrene. After incubation, the entire content of each flask was extracted and analyzed for metabolites. The radioactivity of metabolites and the parent com-
compound was determined by an inline Radiomatic Flow-
One series A-500 radio-chromatography liquid scintilla-
tion detector (Packard Instruments, Downers Grove,
IL) interfaced with a UV detector.

### 2.6. Metabolite identification

Metabolites produced from phenanthrene were isolated by repeated injections of culture extracts in a semi-preparative scale HPLC system consisting of a Beckman model 100A pump (Beckman Instruments, Fullerton, CA), a Waters 486 tunable UV absorbance detector (Waters Corp., Milford, MA), and a Shimadzu model CR601 Chromatopac integrator (Shimadzu Scientific Instruments, Kyoto, Japan). Compounds were separated by the same methanol–water gradient described above using a \(10 \times 250 \mathrm{~mm} 5 \mu \mathrm{m} \mathrm{C}_{18}\) Inertsil ODS-3 column (MetaChem Technologies, Torrance, CA) at a flow rate of \(5.0 \mathrm{mlmin}^{-1}\). The compounds were analyzed by mass and proton nuclear magnetic resonance (\(^{1} \mathrm{H}\) NMR) spectrometry. Mass spectral analyses were performed on a TSQ 700 triple quadruple mass spectrometer (ThermoFinnigan Corp., San Jose, CA). Samples were dissolved in methanol and analyzed by direct exposure probe/electron ionization-mass spectrometry (DEP/EI-MS). NMR spectra were recorded at \(500.13 \mathrm{MHz}\) on a model AM500 spectrometer (Bruker Instruments, Billerica, MA). The samples were dissolved in \(0.5 \mathrm{ml}\) deuterated acetone (99.96 atom \% \({ }^{2} \mathrm{H}\) ). Chemical shifts were reported on the \(\delta\) scale (ppm) by assigning the residual solvent peak to \(2.04 \mathrm{ppm}\) and coupling constants in hertz. Typical spectral acquisition conditions were stated elsewhere ([Moody et al., 2001](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0045-6535(01)00001-X)). Biphenyl metabolites were isolated as described above for phenanthrene metabolites and further analyzed by LCMS using a Hewlett-Packard 1100 HPLC (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA), consisting of a degassing module, autosampler, quaternary solvent pump and diode array detector (DAD), with a \(2.0 \mathrm{~mm} \times 250 \mathrm{~mm} \times 5 \mu \mathrm{m}\) Prodigy ODS-3 column (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA), and a TSQ 7000 (ThermoFinnigan Corp.) mass spectrometer in the negative ion electrospray ionization (ESI) mode. The compounds were eluted

using a 30min linear gradient of 3.0mM ammonium formate in acetonitrile:water mobile phase (30:70 to 100:0 [vol/vol]) at a flow rate of 0.20ml min⁻¹. The metabolites were compared to authentic standards when available.

### 2.7. Circular dichroism spectroscopy

Circular dichroism (CD) spectra of phenanthrene and pyrene trans-dihydrodiols produced by *Cyclothyrium* sp. were obtained in methanol with a Jasco model 500A spectropolarimeter (Japan Spectroscopic, Tokyo, Japan) and were calibrated with ammonium (1R)-(−)-10-camphor sulfonate. The spectra obtained were compared with CD spectra published previously (Sutherland et al., 1990, 1993; Bezalel et al., 1996a,b).

### 3. Results and discussion

*Cyclothyrium* sp. CBS 109850 was cultivated in the presence of individual aromatic hydrocarbons. The fungus metabolized biphenyl, anthracene and phenanthrene, although it could not oxidize naphthalene nor benzo[a]pyrene. The ethyl acetate extracts from biphenyl, naphthalene, anthracene, phenanthrene, pyrene and benzo[a]pyrene biotransformation experiments were analyzed by HPLC and the resultant chromatograms are shown in Fig. 1. In these chromatograms besides the parent compounds and their metabolites, there are also some unlabeled peaks. Since these compounds were also present in the control samples (data not shown), they are possibly natural products produced by the fungus.

Biphenyl is ubiquitous in the environment due to its extensive use as a fungistat for citrus fruits and in food preservatives, heat transfer fluids, and dye carriers, and as the parent compound for polychlorinated biphenyls (Sietmann et al., 2000). *Cyclothyrium* sp. grown in the presence of this compound produced 4-hydroxybiphenyl, which had a HPLC retention time of 29.9min (Fig. 1A). Its UV–visible absorption spectrum (Fig. 2A) and mass spectrum, which had a deprotonated molecular ion [M–H]⁻ at m/z 169, were identical to those of authentic 4-hydroxybiphenyl (Moody et al., 2002). Biphenyl was previously metabolized by *Cunninghamella elegans* to several phenolic products, including 4-hydroxybiphenyl (Dodge et al., 1979; Cerniglia et al., 1982), and similarly by the yeast *Trichosporon mucoides* (Sietmann et al., 2000), the cyanobacterium *Oscillatoria* sp. (Cerniglia et al., 1980) and *Mycobacterium* sp. (Moody et al., 2002).

Naphthalene, a low molecular weight PAH with two benzene rings, is easily metabolized by a wide variety of fungi, including *C. elegans* (Cerniglia and Gibson, 1977; Cerniglia et al., 1978, 1982) and representatives of other fungal groups (Cerniglia et al., 1978). Since *Cyclothyrium* sp. showed the ability to degrade pyrene, phenanthrene and anthracene, it was surprising that it could not metabolize naphthalene. On the other hand naphthalene has high water solubility and thus a higher potential to damage the cell membrane (van Winkle et al., 1999).

Anthracene was oxidized after 192h of incubation to a metabolite produced in a very low concentration

phenanthrene trans-3,4-dihydrodiol, 3-phenanthrol, 1-phenanthrol and 4-phenanthrol have been found from phenanthrene metabolism by *A. niger*, *C. elegans*, *S. racemosum* and *P. chrysosporium* (Sutherland et al., 1991, 1993; Casillas et al., 1996; Sack et al., 1997a). However, to our knowledge, 2-hydroxy-7-methoxyphenanthrene has not yet been detected as product of other fungi, therefore this is a novel fungal metabolite. Sack et al. (1997a) have detected the production of 1-methoxyphenanthrene via 1-phenanthrol by *A. niger*, suggesting that 1-phenanthrol, also produced by this fungus, may be a precursor of the methoxylated phenanthrene derivative. *P. glabrum* oxidized pyrene to several metabolites, including 1-hydroxy-6-methoxypyrene (Wunder et al., 1997).

Fig. 3. Proposed pathways for the metabolism of biphenyl, anthracene, phenanthrene and pyrene by *Cyclothyrium sp.*

Cyclothyrirum sp., in a previous work (da Silva et al., 2003b), produced four metabolites from pyrene after 96h incubation (Fig. 1E); these were trans-4,5-dihydroxy-4,5-dihydropyrene (pyrene trans-4,5-dihydrodiol), pyrene-1,6-quinone, pyrene-1,8-quinone and 1-hydroxypyrene. Pyrene-1,6-quinone, pyrene-1,8-quinone and 1-pyrenol produced by Cyclothyrirum sp. (da Silva et al., 2003b) have already been reported as products of other non-basidiomycete fungi; however, there is no report that zygomycetes and anamorphic fungi oxidize pyrene to pyrene trans-4,5-dihydrodiol. Cyclothyrirum sp. was the first non-basidiomycete to produce a pyrene dihydrodiol (da Silva et al., 2003b). The proposed pathways for the metabolism of biphenyl, anthracene, phenanthrene and pyrene are shown in Fig. 3.

Cyclothyrirum sp. was able to degrade 70%, 74%, 59% and 38% of phenanthrene, pyrene, anthracene and benzo[a]pyrene, respectively, in a mixture after 192h of incubation (da Silva et al., 2003b). In the present study, however, this fungus was not efficient in metabolizing anthracene and benzo[a]pyrene as individual substrates. Filamentous fungi capable of degrading PAHs containing five or more benzene rings, such as benzo[a]pyrene, have been difficult to obtain (Juhasz and Naidu, 2000). The improved degradation of phenanthrene, pyrene, anthracene and benzo[a]pyrene within a synthetic mixture may result from co-oxidation in the presence of a more easily degradable low molecular weight PAH, such as phenanthrene (da Silva et al., 2003b).

The two phenanthrene trans-dihydrodiols produced were analyzed by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. The CD spectrum of the trans-9,10-dihydrodiol shows a positive Cotton effect at 228 nm and negative Cotton effects at 212 and 265 nm (Fig. 4A). Comparison with a previously published CD spectrum of this metabolite, produced by *P. ostreatus* (Bezalel et al., 1996a), indicated that the trans-9,10-dihydrodiol produced by Cyclothyrirum sp. is predominantly the (9R,10R)-enantiomer, which is different from that produced by *P. chrysosporium* (Sutherland et al., 1993) and *Streptomyces flavovirens* (Sutherland et al., 1990). The CD spectrum of phenanthrene trans-3,4-dihydrodiol is illustrated in Fig. 4B. It shows negative Cotton effects at 258 and 300 nm and a positive Cotton effect at 214 nm, indicating that the absolute configuration of the predominant enantiomer produced by Cyclothyrirum sp. is (3R,4R), which is identical to that formed by *P. chrysosporium* (Sutherland et al., 1993).

Pyrene trans-4,5-dihydrodiol was also analyzed by circular dichroism spectroscopy (Fig. 4C). The CD spectrum of this compound shows a negative Cotton effect at 255 nm and a positive Cotton effect at 220 nm, indicating that the absolute configuration is predominantly the (4R,5R)-enantiomer. The same configuration has been reported for the pyrene trans-4,5-dihydrodiol produced by *P. ostreatus* (Bezalel et al., 1996b).

and phenanthrene trans-3,4-dihydrodiol are predominantly in the $(R,R)$ configuration, indicates a high stereoselectivity during pyrene and phenanthrene metabolism by *Cyclothyrium* sp. In Table 2 these results are compared to the data obtained with other filamentous fungi and with mammals. *C. elegans*, *P. ostreatus* and *S. racemosum* exhibit a stereoselectivity similar to that of *Cyclothyrium* sp. (Sutherland et al., 1993; Bezalel et al., 1996a,b). Phenanthrene trans-9,10-dihydrodiols produced by *P. chrysosporium* and rat liver microsomes had $(S,S)$-enantiomers, although they also produced phenanthrene trans-3,4-dihydrodiols with $R,R$ configurations (Sutherland et al., 1993; Shou et al., 1994). Rat liver microsomes, the basidiomycete *P. ostreatus* and *Cyclothyrium* sp., produced pyrene trans-4,5-dihydrodiol with $R,R$ configuration (Shou et al., 1994).

The presence of trans-dihydrodiol PAH metabolites in fungal extract supports the hypothesis that fungal PAH oxidation is mediated by cytochrome P-450 monooxygenase and epoxide hydrolase, similar to mammals (Cerniglia and Gibson, 1979; Launen et al., 1995; Bezalel et al., 1996a,b). The 4,5-positions of pyrene, known as the K-region, are the major sites of mammalian metabolism (Jacob et al., 1982). Since *Cyclothyrium* sp. attacks the K-region of pyrene to form dihydrodiol, it may have enzymes similar to those of mammals (da Silva et al., 2003b). This is corroborated by the fact that the major site of enzymatic attack of *Cyclothyrium* sp. on phenanthrene occurs also in the K-region at the 9,10-positions; 86.5% was metabolized to phenanthrene trans-9,10-dihydrodiol. Microsomal and cytosolic cell fractions of *P. ostreatus* show a cytochrome P-450 activity to transform phenanthrene to the trans-9,10-dihydrodiol in in vitro experiments (Bezalel et al., 1997).

The K-regions of phenanthrene and pyrene are the preferred positions of attack by *Cyclothyrium* sp., showing a high regio- and stereoselectivity during the metabolism of these PAHs. *Cyclothyrium* sp. oxidizes pyrene in a similar way as mammals and basidiomycetes, but differently from other non-basidiomycete fungi. The other PAHs are metabolized likewise other fungi do. *Cyclothyrium* sp. was very efficient in metabolizing various PAHs, especially in a mixture. This suggests that this fungus may be useful for the bioremediation of PAH contaminated sites.
