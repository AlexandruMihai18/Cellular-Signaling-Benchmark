**ABSTRACT**

This review focuses on the biochemical work of UCP1 starting from the early observation by Ricquier and Kader in 1976. We entered this field in 1980 with the isolation of native UCP1 and then reported the amino acid sequence structure discovering a strong homology to the ADP/ATP carrier. With the isolated native UCP1 we studied structural and functional features, in particular the complex characteristics of nucleotide binding. A strong pH dependence of binding and herein the differences between diphospho- and triphospho-nucleotides were observed, resulting in the identification of residues which control binding site access by their H⁺ dissociation. Newly synthesized fluorescent nucleotide derivatives provided tools to determine a two state nucleotide binding in line with loose and tight UCP1 conformations and H⁺ transport inhibition. The slow transition between these states were a notable feature. The reconstitution of isolated UCP1 in vesicles demonstrated that UCP1 protein is in fact the uncoupling factor and not only a nucleotide controlled regulator. The H⁺ transport was shown to be electrophoretic with a linear relation to the membrane potential. The dependence of H⁺ transport on fatty acids (FA) was characterized and is elaborated here with a view of the experimental conditions of other research groups which had different views of the role of FA in H⁺ transport. Furthermore, to explain the contrast of the FA - nucleotide competition between mitochondria and reconstituted system, indirect paths for FA to relieve the inhibition in mitochondria are here proposed, such as a FA induced upward pH shift and a FA induced increase of cardiolipin level around UCP1 since cardiolipin has been found by us to relieve nucleotide binding on isolated UCP1. Recently reported patch clamp results on mitoplasts led to a reformulation of the H⁺ transport mechanism of FA in UCP1 in which bound FA shuttles with the carboxyl group between the two membrane sides along the translocation channel outward as FA⁻ and inward as FA⁻H⁺. We propose here a modified version, where FA forms an immobile prosthetic group surrounded by the inner and outer gate of the H⁺ translocation channel. By alternating opening of the gates FA takes up H⁺ from the cytosol side and releases H⁺ to the matrix.

### 1. Introduction

This review focuses on the biochemistry and regulation of UCP1, comprising the state of the field as reported in previous reviews from our group [1–3] and on the further developments, with special attention to the area around our work. There is general agreement that UCP1 is the principle catalyst for the thermogenesis of brown adipose tissue (BAT) but there exist less agreement how this is implemented. Two aspects are essential, the mechanism of uncoupling and the regulation, i.e. activation and inhibition of UCP1 activity. Here we will concentrate on the short term regulation which is of utmost importance to keep such normally destructive activity under strict control. A crucial feature of UCP1 is the regulatory interaction with purine nucleotides. This will be the dominant topic of our review. Historically the inhibition of the uncoupling by ATP and more effectively by GTP indicated [4] that there was a specific nucleotide binding protein involved [5] and that the uncoupling is not merely a fatty acid effect on the membrane structure. With radiolabeled ADP and GDP Rafael and Heldt [6] and Nichols [7] titrated the binding sites in brown adipose tissue (BAT) mitochondria and showed that they are located at the outer side of the inner membrane. Ricquier and Kader [8] brown adipose tissue (BAT) paved the path for identifying UCP1 when they noted in SDS gels of BAT mitochondria a striking increase of a MW 32 kD protein on cold adaptation of rats. In the following Heaton et al. [9] identified the 32kD protein as a target for nucleotide binding by photo-labelling with azido P³²-ATP in the presence of atractyloside to exclude the binding to AAC. Ricquier et al. [10] then partially purified this protein by affinity chromatography.

### 2. UCP1 — the isolated protein

Since the molecular weight, as judged by SDS gels, and the ability to bind purine nucleotide of the potential uncoupling protein of BAT mitochondria were strikingly similar to the ADP/ATP carrier (AAC), we developed the working hypothesis that this protein might have a similar structure as the AAC. Before we had isolated [11] the native AAC from bovine heart mitochondria as a first membrane transporter protein, based on new principles of detergent usage. Essentially the same isolation methods with some important modifications were successfully applied to mitochondria from hamster BAT for isolating the nucleotide binding protein [12,13]. The separation of the two integral membrane proteins, i.e. the putative uncoupling protein (UCP) from the similar sized AAC was resolved by differential extraction with detergents since UCP was easier solubilized than AAC. Subsequently together with Ricquier [14] we extended the isolation to other rodents such as rats and rabbit. The binding of ³H GDP measured by equilibrium dialysis guided the detection of native protein in the extraction and chromatography steps [12,13]. The nucleotide binding showed not only that solubilized UCP1 was in a native state but also differentiated it from AAC because AAC binds GDP only weakly. With the isolated protein the complete amino acid sequence was determined [15] showing great homology to the previously obtained AAC sequence [16]. Herewith and with the additional sequence of the phosphate carrier [17] the existence of a mitochondrial carrier family was established [18,19]. Bouillaud et al. lead the way for the molecular biology of UCP1 by identifying the complete cDNA [20,21].

### 3. Reconstitution into vesicles

With the isolated protein it became possible by reconstitution to show whether the nucleotide binding UCP1 is the actual uncoupling factor or only a regulating cofactor. In the first communication we termed the isolated protein “uncoupling protein (UCP)” [12], but were then forced by the reviewer of the subsequent paper with a more extensive characterization of the isolated protein [13] to call it “nucleotide binding protein” because it was not yet shown to catalyse uncoupling. Only after we demonstrated in reconstituted vesicles [22–24] that H⁺ transport and nucleotide binding use the same protein the term UCP became vindicated.

The purified UCP1 formed a platform for studying the parameters governing the activation and the inhibition of the uncoupling, independently of the complex environmental factors in mitochondria. The reconstitution of isolated UCP1 required rigorous measures for tighter vesicles against H⁺ leakage than the previous reconstitution of the AAC [25]. For example, although UCP1 in Triton X100 is more stable it had to be replaced by C₁₀E₅ for the removal of endogenous fatty acids (FA) from the vesicles [22–24]. In the proteoliposomes H⁺ transport was measured directly using pH indicators. Before H⁺ transport had been inferred from swelling or respiration measurements with BAT mitochondria. In the reconstituted system we determined a linear relation between the diffusion (membrane) potential and H⁺ transport, characterising it as an electrophoretic transport [22]. The catalytic role of FA and the regulation by nucleotides were then a major topic of the reconstituted system [26].

### 4. Nucleotide binding

In our studies of the nucleotide interaction with UCP1, the comparison with AAC revealed intriguing common and different nucleotide effects on these proteins [27]. Both inner mitochondrial membrane proteins shared the binding capacity for purine nucleotides. In both cases the binding did not involve Mg²⁺. Differences existed in the specificity: AAC interacted with ADP and ATP more than 10 times more efficient than with GDP and GTP whereas with UCP1 the binding affinities are about equal. In UCP1 the nucleotide binds only from the intermembrane aspect, in AAC the binding site opens alternatively to both sides of the inner membrane. In UCP1 the nucleotide acts as an inhibitor, whereas in AAC it is an autocatalytic activator of transport. The nucleotides have a high binding affinity in UCP1 and a low affinity in the AAC, both in accordance with the induced transition fit of transport catalysis [28].

### 5. pH dependency of binding

Striking features of the nucleotide binding to UCP1, are a strong pH dependence [7,29] and a slow binding rate [29] associated with a two stage loose and tight binding. Two different methods, a millipore membrane diffusion equilibrium and a rapid ion exchange were applied for the binding measurements over a wide range of pH from 5.5 to 8.0, covering large changes of binding affinity. For ADP and GDP with increasing pH a marked decrease of the affinity starting at around pH 6.2 was determined. In the pK_D/pH plot the linear slope changed from –0.2 to –1 above pH 6.2. With ATP and GTP the slope of the pK_D/pH curve are more complex and displayed two change steps, at pH 6.2 and additionally at pH 7.2, resulting in a slope of nearly –2. For example at a pH increase of 0.5 from 7.2 to 7.7 the K_D increases 30 fold for the triphosphate (NTP) but only 3 fold for the diphospho-nucleotide (NDP). The steep pH induced loss of binding has great significance for the regulation of UCP1 activity since ATP as the abundant nucleotide in the cytosol should be the major physiological inhibitor of UCP1.

What is the mechanism of this pH driven regulation [29]? The combination of H⁺ dissociating groups of the nucleotides and of specific residues in the UCP1 produces the observed pH dependence. We were able to quantitatively describe the complex pK_D/pH
curve as an interplay between the dissociation equilibrium of the nucleotide pairs NTP$^{4-}$/NTPH$^{3-}$ and NDP$^{3-}$/NDPH$^{2-}$ on one side and the ionization equilibrium of H$^+$ dissociating residues in UCP1 on the other side, such as Glu$^-$/GluH with a pK$_\mathrm{D} = 4$ and HisH$^+$/His with pK$_\mathrm{D} = 7.2$, implying that these permit binding only in the protonated state. On the basis of these residues we achieved a complete simulation of the complex affinity/pH curves of ATP and GTP as well as of ADP and GDP in which the fully ionized NTP$^{4-}$ and NDP$^{3-}$ are the preferred binding species with intrinsic high affinities of pK$_\mathrm{D}^\mathrm{N} = 9.0$ for NTP$^4$, 7.3 for NTPH$^3-$ and 6.6 for ADPH$^{2-}$. The much lower measured affinities are the result of the low pK$_\mathrm{D}$ of the undissociated $-\mathrm{COOH}$ groups controlling the binding in the pH range 6–8. A molecular binding mechanism for the pH control was proposed [2,30] (Fig. 1), in which the entry to the binding pocket for the phosphate moieties of the nucleotides is controlled by the H$^+$ dissociation of an acidic group with pK 4, e.g. Glu$^-$ forming a salt bridge with a cationic residue thus blocking the entry. On protonation of Glu the ion pair is split and the gate opened. An additional H$^+$ group, controlling the binding of the triphosphate moiety of NTP is visualized to control the depth of the binding niche. With pK$_\mathrm{A} = 7.2$ the group can be His which we proposed to protrude at the bottom of the binding cavity thus blocking the triphosphate moiety of NTP, but does not hinder the shorter diphosphate moiety of NDP. On protonation His$^+$ is retracted by background negative residues now enlarging the pocket at the bottom and admitting the triphosphate group. A schematic summary of the binding at the suggested pocket of UCP1 with the pH dependent control is given in Fig. 1.

### 6. Mapping binding sites for nucleotides

The existence and the nature of these regulatory residues was substantiated by specific chemical probes and directed mutagenesis. Heterologous expression and the identification of function by site directed mutagenesis was facilitated by the fortunate high level expression of rodent UCP1 in native state in the mitochondria of S. cerevisiae [31–33] which featured a similar pH dependency of the nucleotide binding as UCP1 isolated from BAT. The expression of

other UCPs in yeast encountered problems. For example, UCP3 expressed in high levels in cerevisiae was not located in mitochondria but in inclusion bodies in an inactive state [34].

The identification of the pH regulating residues confirmed the described scenario. We found that the covalent carboxyl reagent Woodward reagent K (WRK) inhibited noncompetitively binding of GTP and GDP both in mitochondria and the isolated UCP1 [33,35]. Conversely, nucleotide binding protected against WRK, indicating that WRK binds at the nucleotide bind site. WRK turned out to be the most effective inhibitor since at a molar ratio as low as 2 WRK/UCP1, the nucleotide binding was completely inhibited showing that WRK reacts nearly exclusive at the binding site, despite the presence of 19 other carboxyl groups in UCP1. With $^3$H–BH$_4$ the adduct of WRK and UCP1 was radioactively labelled and the target identified as E190 in the UCP1 sequence using the same fragmentation steps which we had developed for obtaining the total amino acid sequence of UCP1.

To further support the role of E190 in the pH control, the carboxyl group was “neutralized” in the E190Q mutant UCP1 expressed in S. cerevisiae [33]. This mutant displayed a much reduced pH dependency of nucleotide binding. H214 was identified as a candidate for the pH regulation of only NTP binding, since H214N showed a decreased pH dependency approaching that of NDP binding [36]. Further the histidine reagent diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC) prevented GTP but not GDP from inhibiting H$^+$ transport. The steric hindrance and retracting mechanism for the pH control of NTP binding is further supported by the H214W mutant where obviously the bulkier substituent tryptophane decreased the binding affinity [36,37] (see Fig. 1 of pH regulating mechanism). For the retracting mechanism of H214 regulation (His$^+$) two adjacent acidic residues D209 and D210 are strong candidates since in D209N and D210N the pH dependency is decreased [37].

The binding area for the adenine moiety in UCP1 was explored with $^{14}$C- or $^{32}$P- labelled 2-azido-ATP and 8-azido-ATP [38,39]. Both derivatives bound reversibly with high affinity and could be covalently incorporated as chemical probes into UCP1 by photo-affinity labelling. By specific fragmentation and peptide

**Fig. 1.** Interpretation of the pH dependent molecular interactions of diphospho- and triphospho-nucleotides in UCP1. Schematic changes of the binding pocket adapting for the binding either of diphospho - or triphospho – moieties under the regulation of H$^+$ dissociating groups. Different sizes of the binding pocket for di – and triphosphate moieties are regulated by protonisation of H214 which blocks the niche for the $\gamma$-phosphate (upper row). At higher pH nucleotide triphosphates can bind because H214 is retracted as HisH$^+$ by background negative charges of D209 and D210. The gatekeeper E190 controls by its protonisation the gate of the pocket for both di- and triphosphate binding. It opens the gate with increasing pH. (Numbering of original amino acid sequence according to [1]).
sequencing 8-azido-ATP was found to incorporate to T265 and 2- azido-ATP to T260. The putative position of the ATP molecule in a model of the UCP1 structure, based on the mapping results is shown in Fig. 2. Whereas the distances to E191 and H215 are small in line with their roles, the distances between the adenine and T261 and T265 located at the m-side are too large for covalent binding in this configuration. In the former fitting model based on the folding model constructed still independent of the AAC structure, the region with the matrix short helix and the adjacent coil were positioned more inside the membrane plugging the channel (Fig. 8 in Ref. [1]). The photoaffinity results would favor a structure more in line with the latter model or reflect a greater flexibility of ATP binding, at least concerning the adenine moiety.

Using the heterologous expression of UCP1 in yeast the functional role of further residues was probed. We payed particular attention to charged residues which are located within the putative transmembrane helices. Thus four arginines, three of them strikingly similarly located [1] (see Fig. 2) forming a triad near the center of the three even numbered helices (R83I, R182Q, R276Q, R91T) and the uniquely in the second helix located R91 were “neutralized” by mutagenesis [40]. In all these mutant UCP1 the binding of nucleotides was lost but the H⁺ transport unaffected. This agrees partially with results reported by another group [41], but is at variance with the claim that in R276Q the nucleotide binding is unaffected but still the inhibition of H⁺ transport is abolished. The three inter-repeat homologue Arg are part of the mitochondrial

carrier family motif and thus not specific for UCP. In the homologue AAC structure their role is assumed to be involved in transport [42] and in agreement then shown in the atomic structure to act as constituents of the binding center [43,44]. The mutagenesis date of UCP1 showed [40] that these intra-helical Arg are involved in nucleotide binding but not in H⁺ transport. The intra-helical acidic residue E27 is unique for UCP1 and other UCPs but does not have a homologue in other mitochondrial carriers. Interestingly bovine AAC1 contains at the same position a unique K27. Their specific involvement in transport is shown by the inhibition of transport of H⁺ in D27N–UCP1 [37] and of ADP in K27N-AAC [42] respectively. D27 qualifies as the most convincing constituent H⁺ transferring carboxyl group postulated in our model [2,26] as discussed below.

### 7. Two stage binding

Another notable feature is the two stage binding of the nucleotides to UCP1 with at least two levels of binding strength as observed using fluorophore substituted nucleotides. We originally used fluorescent DAN substituted nucleotides to study binding and conformation changes of the AAC [45,46] before applying these and the newly synthesized fluorescent DANSYL-nucleotides to UCP1 [30]. All four DANSYL-derivatives of AMP, ADP, ATP, GTP bound to UCP1 showed an about 5–10 fold fluorescence increase. They bound with a wide range of affinities. DANSYL–GTP had the highest binding affinity whereas DAN-nucleotides were generally weaker ligands. Comparing the binding of ¹⁴C or ³H labelled DANSYL nucleotides measured by ion exchange assay and by fluorescence titration, a discrepancy between these methods uncovered the existence of a variable share of more loose binding in the total binding. The loose binding share was lowest with DANSYL-GTP and highest with DAN-ATP.

The nucleotide binding causes tightening of the UCP1 conformation as determined by the limited proteolysis by trypsin and chymotrypsin. A precise criterion yielded the specific cleavage of a C-terminal 12 residue peptide by trypsin [47,48]. The shortened 292 residue long UCP1 was still able to bind DANSYL-GTP, whereas smaller the proteolytic product of 22 kD by chymotryptic digestion had lost the binding [48]. Since the cleavage at residue 292 works in mitochondria but not in submitochondrial particles, we concluded that the C-terminal protrudes to the c-side. The protection against trypsin digestion by nucleotide binding indicated a change of UCP1 to a more tight conformation. However, the fluorescent DAN-ATP did not confer a protection against trypsin proteolysis, indicating that its loose binding induces no structure tightening. This also shows that the protection against trypsin is not caused by an occupation of the proteolytic site but indirectly by a conformation change. By extending these experiments to the DANSYL- and DAN-nucleotide derivatives [49], a spectrum of complete, intermediary and no inhibition of tryptic digestion was obtained, which correlated with the varying share of tight to loose binding.

Most notable was the finding that only the tight binding caused inhibition of H⁺ transport. A linear correlation was found between the degree of inhibition and the share of tight binding over the whole range of loose/tight states covered by the nucleotide derivatives [49]. These findings supported the model that nucleotides do not inhibit by a steric blockage of the transport path, but that a conformation change induced by the tight binding causes the inhibition. The change of C-terminal conformation from high to low mobility was also evident in S–S crosslinking experiments between two near C-terminal cysteines in the UCP1 dimer. The easily induced crosslinking was suppressed by nucleotides indicating the immobilization of the SH group on transition into the tight state [50].

The fluorescence derivatives enabled convenient measurements
of the kinetics of binding and dissociation [30,51], since the fluorescence yield is similar for the loose and tight binding states. The rapid binding rates were in a similar range for all the derivatives. In contrast the generally slower dissociation rates measured on addition of excess ATP showed large differences, in line with the different affinities determined by the titrations. Using the competition with the fluorescent DANSYL-ATP, the binding affinities covering a wide range of nucleotide derivatives and analogues were determined. With the exception of GTP and GDP the relative specificity is similar to the specificity of nucleotide interactions with the AAC.

Using the heterologous expression of UCP1 in yeast the functional role of further residues was probed. We paid particular attention to charged residues which are located within the putative transmembrane helices. Thus four arginines, three of them regularly located near the end of the three even numbered helices (R83I, R182Q, R276Q) and the uniquely located R91 to R91T were “neutralized” [40]. In all these mutant UCP1 the binding of nucleotides was lost but the H⁺ transport unaffected. This agrees partially with results reported by another group [41], but is at variance with the claim that in R276Q the nucleotide binding is unaffected but still the inhibition of H⁺ transport is abolished. Since the triad Arg are part of the carrier family motif and thus not specific for UCP1, we concluded that they are indirectly involved in nucleotide binding for example stabilizing the structure. The intra-helical acid residue E27 is unique for UCP1 and not found in other mitochondrial carrier. Interestingly bovine AAC1 contains at the same position a unique K27. Their specific involvement in transport is shown by the inhibition of transport of H⁺ in D28N–UCP1 [37] and of ADP in K27N-AAC [42] respectively. D28 qualifies as a H⁺ transferring carboxyl group postulated in our model [2,26] as discussed below.

### 8. Regulation of UCP1 by FA

The reconstitution of isolated UCP1 formed the basis for rigorous studies of the transport and its regulation of UCP1, independently from the complexity of mitochondria. The chapter “Intracellular regulation of UCP1” in our last review [3], summarizing and interpreting the data situation of the short term regulation of UCP1 provides the basis for an updated interpretation incorporating the data reported in the meantime. In brief, the principle arguments were and are as follows: (a) the data obtained with the isolated — reconstituted UCP1 are of significance also for the mitochondria and the cellular situation; (b) fatty acids and nucleotides, i.e. the intracellular abundant ATP and ADP, are short term activators and inhibitors; (c) the inhibition by nucleotides is strongly influenced by pH; (d) fatty acids are directly involved in H⁺ transport by UCP1.

How can we reconcile these characteristics of the isolated and reconstituted UCP1 with apparently contrary findings of the UCP1 regulation in BAT mitochondria? The greatest problem has been to understand the involvement of FA in the UCP1 dependent uncoupling. Without reviewing these developments in detail, the following picture emerges. One line of thought is that FA do not directly operate in the UCP1 mediated uncoupling, but activate by some peripheral mechanism and that as a basic function UCP1 alone is able to transport H⁺ [52–54]. In the swelling (H⁺ conductance) experiments with non-respiring BAT mitochondria the membrane potential was comparatively low also without FA and the H⁺ conductance was highly sensitive to nucleotides. In respiring BAT mitochondria nucleotides raise the “breakpoint” of the nonlinear current/voltage relation to 180 mV in conjunction with the coupling effect. FA addition stimulates uncoupling (H⁺ conductance) and lowers the break point, thus overriding the nucleotide inhibition. In the reconstituted system the high K⁺ diffusion Δψ initiated for driving H⁺ conduction can only be sustained transiently [23,26] and FA are not able to overcome the inhibition by nucleotide because of the higher binding affinity. Further, in the reconstituted system the H⁺ transport activity increases linearly with Δψ without a break point over a large range between 10 and 180 mV [22,23].

Another group [55,56] comparing the respiration of wild type with UCP1 (-,-) mitochondria concluded that the uncoupling activation by FA, with and without nucleotides, does not involve UCP1 since the same activation by FA occurs in UCP1(-, -) mitochondria [55]. In further work, however, separating the FA activation from FA oxidation effects, the same group elaborated that UCP1 is inherently active and does not need FA as cofactor [56]. Instead FA were visualized to act as competitive antagonists of nucleotide binding and thus relief the inhibition. They maintain that FA and nucleotides probably do not compete from a common binding site in line with the evidence from mutant UCP1 reviewed above [37,57]. To account for the FA requirement of H⁺ conduction in the reconstituted system even in the absence of nucleotides, it was suggested [56] that FA were required to convert the isolated reconstituted protein into the active mitochondrial form by substituting for another lipid-like cofactor in the native membrane that is removed on isolation of UCP1. As will be reviewed below, cardiolipin is a candidate for the intermediary factor in the regulation of nucleotide inhibition and FA activation.

Since in the reconstituted system the inhibition by nucleotides is uncompetitive with FA [26,58], in mitochondria the observed competition between FA and nucleotides might be indirect, i.e. not at a common binding site. We suggested [3] that under physiological stimulation of uncoupling, in the mitochondria being flooded with FA, the local intermembrane pH may increase and the level of ATP decrease as a result of FA activation into acyl CoA which should release ATP from UCP1. Indeed, a cytoplasmic pH increase had been observed on stimulation of thermogenesis in BAT [59].

Evidence that ATP dissociates from UCP1 in BAT upon activation of thermogenesis is actually documented in experiments that resolved the once unexplained masking – unmasking phenomenon of nucleotide binding to UCP1 in BAT mitochondria [60]. When BAT mitochondria were isolated from warm-adapted rats, UCP1 was found to be largely occupied by endogenous ATP whereas on short term cold exposure of rats the free binding sites of UCP1 titrated with exogenous ATP strongly increased.

Another factor considering the uncompetitive inhibition to account for is the much tighter inhibition by GDP in the reconstituted system with Ki = 1 μM as compared to about 100 μM in mitochondria [26]. This difference is partially caused by the lower external pH of 6.7 generally used in the proteoliposomes for driving H⁺ inside. Because of this optimization of Δμ(H+) the UCP1 turnover rates are much higher (20–30 times) in the proteoliposomes than in the mitochondria. The tight nucleotide binding may render the FA versus nucleotide effect de facto uncompetitive. Using fluorescent DANSYL-GTP (see above) a competitive partial removal of the nucleotide from mitochondria by high concentrations of long chain FA was found [61]. Further, based on the limited proteolysis by trypsin and chymotrypsin, FA was shown [48] to loosen the structure of the nucleotide UCP1 complex. More recently these competition results were confirmed [62] using fluorescent MANTH-GDP on BAT mitochondria.

### 9. Mechanism of H⁺ transport by UCP1

The discussion on the mechanism of transport by UCP1 focuses mainly on the role of FA. Except for the extreme position discussed above that the role of FA is confined to abolishing the inhibition by
nucleotides, there are several variant mechanisms of how FA are involved in the H⁺ transport by UCP1 as first schematized in Ref. [26], under the provision that the differences between the models may be fluent. (a) The allosteric model: FA induce a H⁺ transport activating conformation change of UCP1 without interfering directly with the H⁺ translocation, for example by binding to the protein from the lipid annulus. This early model was originally suggested based on work with BAT mitochondria [52]. (b) The prosthetic group (buffering) model: FA are directly involved in H⁺ translocation by providing a H⁺ donor/acceptor group for catalyzing the H⁺ transfer within the central carrier path. FA act as prosthetic group and as H⁺ buffer, either alone or in series with constituent carboxyl groups, filling a gap in the H⁺ conduction path [26]. This model was conceived in conjunction with the exploration of the FA effects on transport in reconstituted vesicles. (c) The FA anion cycling model: UCP1 provides a translocation path for FA anions bound to the protein, which after leaving the protein into the bilayer pick up H⁺ on the cytosolic side and diffuse as neutral FA acid back through the lipid layer releasing H⁺ into the matrix. The rate limiting step would be the anion transfer by UCP1. Extensive experiments on the translocation of alkyl-sulfonates as model FA anions in reconstituted vesicles form the basis for this model [58,63]. However the transport rates of these anions are low as compared to FA catalyzed H⁺ transport.

(d) The FA shuttling model [64]: FA bound to UCP1 shuttles or swings in the UCP1 channel with the carboxyl group alternating in the anion or acid form, picking up H⁺ on the cytosolic and releasing H⁺ on the matrix side. This model is based on measuring patch clamp currents of UCP1 activity in mitoplasts [64]. Measurements of ion currents under varying configurations of solutes on both sides of the patch clamp provide great accuracy of the current responses and considerable freedom in selecting the experimental parameters. First the measurements show, that by eliminating traces of endogenously generated FA, UCP1 linked H⁺ transport is absolutely dependent on FA and that there is no constitutive basic FA-independent H⁺ transport. Thus the results exclude model (a). FA derivatives with a high pK and long chain alkyl-anions, such as alkyl-sulfonates used to prove the anion FA cycle [58,63], are not transported but can enter UCP1 only from the c-side, which is incompatible with the FA cycle model (c). Short chain alkyl-sulfonates are transported at low rates reflecting the anion transport capability of UCP1. It was also confirmed by this method that FA and nucleotides are competitive antagonists. The total results are interpreted to show that long chain FA remain stuck in UCP1 with the carboxyl protruding into the aqueous translocation channel shuttling between both sides and picking up H⁺ at the cytosolic (c)-side and delivering H⁺ at the matrix (m)-side. FA acts like a mobile prosthetic group catalyzing H⁺ transport.

The shuttling model (d) is similar to model (b) based on reconstituted UCP1. Formerly a more specific model had been proposed by us [2] to account for the influence of the FA chain length and of the external pH on the H⁺ uptake rate in the primarily right side out UCP1 proteoliposomes. H⁺ transport increased strongly with FA chain length reaching a maximum with C12 to C16 (Fig. 3, see also [64]). Also the pH dependent maximum increased strongly with the chain length to higher pH and correlates to the known increase of the pKₐ of long chain FA when bound to membranes. This shows that a balance between dissociated and undissociated FA is crucial for transport. Further the external pH was found to control dominantly the rates showing that FA docked from the c-side section of UCP1 are of importance for the transport.

A model with a cavity to the c - side based on a folding model of the UCP1 structure (before the crystal structure of AAC in 2003) was adapted [2] to account for FA mobility and H⁺ transfer in the c-side channel (Fig. 4). FA anchored in UCP1 swing with their long chain

Fatty acid as H⁺ conducting cofactor in UCP

Fig. 4. A proposed mechanism of the role of FA in H⁺ transport by UCP1. From Ref. [2]. The block structure is derived from folding models of UCP1 [1]. FA are bound in a partially mobile state with their acyl chain bound to the protein or lipid interface. The FA-carboxyl group swings back and forth in the anionic or protonated state, thus transporting H⁺ toward the matrix side. At a constriction at the m-gate His potentially takes over H⁺ for release into the matrix.

from the c-side down the path to the m-gate. Different from the shuttle, FA do not reach the m-side, the final H⁺ transfer step at the m-side employs H⁺ transferring residues such as H145 and H147 [65]. This model must be reinterpreted to mean that it only represents the c-state of UCP1 when the m-gate is closed. The transport of short chain FA or derivatives requires that the translocation path has at least a small opening to the m-side. Indeed, the shuttling model although implying that UCP1 is a transporter and not a channel does not take into account the gating of the gated pore mechanism [66–68] with the conformation changes essential for a transporter. A gating pore mechanism of UCP1, modelled according to the original gated pore conceived for the ADP/ATP carrier, is illustrated in Fig. 5 with a clockwise translocation cycle. As previously suggested, anchored FA acts as a prosthetic group with the carboxyl as a H⁺ donor/acceptor. In the catalytic cycle the electrophoretic step is the m-to c-side transition with FA as an anion. As shown by the membrane potential profile along the translocation path, the potential remains near the m-level into the FA anion binding center. On switching the gate openings the potential at the center strongly increases nearly to the c-level. The membrane potential change at the bound FA anion drives the transition and produces a current flowing to the c-side. This mechanism would agree with the observed patch clamp currents. As previously proposed [2], in addition to FA constituent carboxyl groups may contribute to the H⁺ transport. As reported above, a probable candidate is D28 which is uniquely positioned and is characteristic for the UCP subfamily. D28 was found by mutagenesis [40] to be essential for transport of H⁺ but not for the accessory transport of Cl⁻ by UCP1, underlining the specificity of D28 function.

Both the shuttling and the prosthetic group models engage a binding site for the FA anion. In the shuttling model it is mobile, oscillating between positions at the cytosolic and the matrix cavities whereas in the prosthetic group model the binding site is more stationary at the center of the translocation path. As elegantly

shown in the patch clamp experiments, long chain FA become stuck in the UCP1 whereas short chain FA are translocated and freely released [64]. The patch clamp currents are compatible with both the shuttling model and the prosthetic model comprising the gated pore mechanism of carrier catalysis. However, only the stationary (prosthetic group) model is compatible with the UCP1 structure considering that in the gated pore mechanism the carrier (UCP1) provides an alternating central site, flanked by the two gated translocation channels. The occurrence of a constituent carboxyl group is also more compatible with the stationary version. The central binding site mechanism was confirmed for the AAC by the atomic structure [69] and is implied in the simulated structures of the mitochondrial carrier family including UCP1 [70]. Recent meta-dynamics simulations of the AAC covering the whole translocation from the c-to the m –state further substantiated this mechanism [71].

### 10. Cardiolipin and UCP1

Similarly as for the AAC, relatively high amounts of nonionic detergent were required for solubilisation and isolation of UCP1 from BAT [13] but different from AAC a much lower ionic strength was needed. This can be related to a lower excess of positively charged residues in UCP1 than in AAC, some of which are probably involved in linking the protein to phospholipid headgroups, in particular of cardiolipin (CL) [43]. Indeed, we had found by ³¹P-NMR [72] that isolated AAC contains three tightly bound molecules of CL, which could be only released on unfolding the protein. In addition about 10 CL bound more loosely per AAC micelle as was deduced from spinlabel ESR spectroscopy [73]. In contrast isolated UCP1 was found to have very low content of tightly bound CL [74], in accordance with a less tight anchoring in the membrane. At variance recently binding of 3 molecules CL to isolated UCP1 were reported [75], using a different isolation procedure.

Fig. 5. The catalytic cycle of H⁺ transport by UCP1. Similarly as other solute carriers, UCP1 operates as a gated pore implicating that in the c- and m-state conformation either one gate is closed and open. FA binding at the center has a prosthetic group like function. Binding and dissociation of H⁺ at the FA carboxyl are essential for translocation. The putative membrane potential profile along the translocation path, is shown for the c- and m-states. It drives with the anionic FA the m-to c-state transition of UCP1. On switching the gating during the H⁺ translocation the asymmetric nonlinear membrane potential profile changes such that the anionic charge of FA experiences a Δψ increase, which corresponds to an energy drop in the m-to c-transition. As indicated, constituent carboxyl groups, represented by D28 participate in H⁺ transfer.

Fig. 6. The transition of UCP1 between the various states of nucleotide (N) and FA binding under the influence of cardiolipin (CL). CL is visualized to decrease nucleotide binding in mitochondria or the reconstituted system and thus activates H+ transport. Illustration that FA have a double function: a catalytic one by acting directly in H+ translocation and a regulatory one influencing UCP1 activity indirectly by inducing CL mobilization. On triggering thermogenesis in mitochondria the unevenly distributed CL is mobilized by the strong increase of the FA level so that it can access UCP and thus release nucleotide. Adapted from Ref. [76].

Whereas the reconstitution of the ADP/ATP transport by AAC required the addition of CL [74], the reconstitution of H+ transport by UCP1 did not [23]. More than 10% CL added to the phospholipids partially decreased the H+ transport rate. But interestingly, CL interfered with the inhibition of H+ transport by nucleotides in a quasi-competitive manner [74]. As a result CL could relief the inhibition by nucleotides, or in other terms, activate the nucleotide attenuated transport. These results are complemented by binding studies of GDP to isolated UCP1, showing a competitive inhibition of GDP binding by CL, for example such that 8% CL increased the KD for GDP 8 fold.

Some issues of the regulation of UCP1 may be resolved by these findings. As discussed above, the intracellular level of ATP and ADP should not permit UCP1 to exist in a free and active state in BAT unless the pH is markedly increased. In view of these results, it is surprising that in mitochondria containing about 15% CL, the affinity for nucleotides is nearly as high as in reconstituted vesicles without CL (see Table in Refs. [29,60]). This may indicate that in mitochondria UCP1 has little contact with CL, at least in the inhibited state. CL is probably not evenly distributed in the inner membrane. A considerable part is associated with membrane proteins and a larger part may be concentrated in CL rich lipid domains, and as a result the amount of CL available to UCP1 may be low. We suggested [76] that the level of “free” CL and conversely of domain bound CL varies under different metabolic conditions of the BAT. When on cold exposure thermogenesis is triggered and BAT mitochondria are flooded with FA, these may intercalate with the CL rich domains and thus release CL into the bulk area of the membrane from where it can access UCP1 and cause ATP to dissociate from UCP1. The levels of FA accumulated in the inner membrane are probably high (>5 mol %). With their negative charges FA should perturb the CL rich domains by repelling and releasing “free” CL. According to our, when CL reaches a level of at least 3–4% around UCP1, the binding of ATP is relaxed and the inhibition of the FA-dependent H+ transport abolished. This would be an indirect competitive effect of FA on nucleotide binding. The scheme in Fig. 6 depicts the proposed relationships between nucleotide and FA binding under the influence of CL, in reconstituted vesicles and mitochondria.
