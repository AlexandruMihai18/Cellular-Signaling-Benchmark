The role of malaria merozoite proteases in red blood cell invasion

Rebecca A O'Donnell and Michael J Blackman

Invasion of red blood cells by the malaria merozoite is an essential step in the life cycle of this obligate intracellular pathogen. The molecular details of invasion are only recently becoming understood, largely through studies in related apicomplexan parasites such as *Toxoplasma*. Protease activity is required for successful invasion to disengage interactions between parasite adhesins and host cell receptors. Shedding of at least two essential surface proteins from the merozoite is thought to occur continuously during invasion as the parasite moves into the nascent parasitophorous vacuole. This shedding is performed by way of juxtamembrane cleavage and is mediated by a sheddase, which probably belongs to the subtilisin-like superfamily. Recent revelations have shown that transmembrane adhesins that are secreted onto the *Toxoplasma* tachyzoite surface and capped to its posterior pole are shed by way of cleavage within their transmembrane domains. A family of intramembrane serine proteases called rhomboids have now been identified within Apicomplexa, and one *Toxoplasma* rhomboid has been localized to the posterior end of the parasite. This supports their role in capping proteolysis. Proteases involved in invasion constitute potential targets for the development of new protease inhibitor-based drugs.

Introduction  
It has been said that the only good reason to study a pathogen is to learn how to kill it. Understanding how best to kill the malaria parasite motivates many that work on the organism and recent estimates indicating that there are 300–660 million clinical cases of malaria per annum should only strengthen this incentive [1]. The causative agent of malaria belongs to a ubiquitous and highly successful phylum called Apicomplexa, and all members of this phylum are obligate intracellular protozoal parasites. Their predominantly intracellular lifestyle provides them with significant evolutionary advantages, including evasion of host immune responses and, in the case of the blood-stage malaria parasite, ready access to an abundant source of nutrients in the form of haemoglobin, which makes up around 90% of the total red blood cell proteins. Clinical malaria directly results from replication of the asexual blood-stage forms of the parasite, and red blood cell invasion has long been considered the weakest link in the chain of the erythrocytic life cycle. Invasion is therefore a target for vaccines or drugs designed to interfere with receptor-ligand interactions and important enzymatic processes at the parasite-host cell surface interface. Proteases involved in invasion fall into the latter category.

This short review describes advances in our knowledge of these enzymes and their role, with a focus on progress over the past two years.

The mechanics of invasion  
An ultrastructural description of red blood cell invasion was first provided through what are now classical early videomicroscopy and electron microscopic studies [2–4]. These showed that invasion is rapid and is completed within ~30 s, and that it involves at least four separate steps: an initial low-affinity interaction between any part of the merozoite and the host cell surface; reorientation of the merozoite to allow its apical prominence to contact the host cell; irreversible attachment, concomitant with formation of an electron-dense junction between apical prominence and the host cell; and invasion proper, in which the junction is translocated back over the parasite circumference as is it propelled forward into an invagination in the host cell membrane called the parasitophorous vacuole, which eventually seals behind the parasite.

Although these studies are highly informative, in isolation they cannot provide a complete picture of invasion. The small dimensions of the malaria merozoite (~1–2 μm in diameter, depending on the *Plasmodium* species) and its exceedingly short invasive half-life once outside the cell have hindered mechanistic studies of red blood cell invasion. Thus, much of our knowledge of invasion biochemistry derives from work in other life cycle stages, such as mosquito salivary gland sporozoites, or in other apicomplexan genera, especially *Toxoplasma*.

A current model of invasion proposes that whereas the initial low affinity interactions occur between the host and the resident parasite surface molecules, reorientation and junction formation are mediated by higher affinity

transmembrane adhesins released from a set of secretory organelles called micronemes at the apical end of the parasite. These adhesins bind host cell surface receptors through their ectodomains and engage with a cortical actinomyosin motor through their cytoplasmic domains. Rearward myosin-driven capping of the adhesins then draws the junction around the parasite and provides the traction to drive invasion. Successful completion of invasion requires the eventual disengagement of all these adhesin–receptor interactions, which is accomplished by proteolytic shedding of the adhesins. This can be performed either continuously at the interface between moving junction and parasite surface, as in the case of the surface-resident adhesins (known as ‘shaving’ proteolysis; Figure 1), or at the extreme posterior of the parasite in the final seconds of invasion, as in the case of the micronemal adhesins that are subject to capping (‘capping’ proteolysis; Figure 2). Both during and after invasion, microneme exocytosis is followed sequentially by the secretion of two other sets of organelles — rhoptries and dense granules.

This overview of invasion, which has recently been reviewed extensively [5*,6,7*,8,9], is probably greatly oversimplified; for example it provides no explanation of the signalling pathways that trigger organelle exocy-

tosis, nor of the processes that govern the formation and the sealing of the parasitophorous vacuole. Nonetheless, it provides a conceptual scaffold on which new (and old) observations can be hung and is amenable to testing with new experimental approaches. Of relevance here, it describes a plausible role for parasite proteases in invasion.

### Sheddases and proteolytic processing of merozoite resident surface proteins

As with many protozoa, proteins trafficked directly to the plasma membrane of the malaria merozoite are membrane-bound either directly through a glycosyl phosphatidylinositol anchor or indirectly by being peripherally associated with a glycosyl phosphatidylinositol-anchored protein. To date, a total of ten surface proteins (MSP1– MSP10) have been assigned to the merozoite surface, with varying degrees of confidence. Most interest has been focused on MSP1 for several reasons, including the facts that its gene was the first to be cloned, that it induces invasion-inhibitory or protective antibody responses (giving it potential as a vaccine), and that it is probably one of the most abundant constituents of the merozoite surface. MSP1 is synthesized as a ~200 kDa precursor protein that is subject to proteolytic processing soon after transport to the plasma membrane of the intracellular developing

Shaving proteolysis. Schematic depicting a model for MESH-mediated shedding of the MSP1 complex during red blood cell invasion by the malaria merozoite. Initial binding of the malaria merozoite (brown) (a) is followed by reorientation and junction formation (b), which is mediated by apically-restricted adhesins that are released from micronemes (not shown for clarity). MESH (green) is then also released from micronemes onto the merozoite surface (c) and remains fixed at the moving junction, which is translocated over the parasite surface as it enters the parasitophorous vacuole (d,e). In the process, MSP1 (blue) is cleaved at a juxtamembrane site releasing the bulk of the complex extracellularly. AMA1 is similarly processed by MESH in *P. falciparum*. This process might not occur in *Toxoplasma*, and in *Plasmodium* it might be accompanied by the process depicted in Figure 2.

Capping proteolysis. Schematic depicting a model for rhomboid-mediated shedding of TRAP-like proteins during red blood cell invasion by the malaria merozoite. The model is based on work in *Toxoplasma* described in the text. Initial binding (a) is mediated by surface-resident adhesins such as MSP1 (not shown for clarity). Reorientation and junction formation (b) is performed through limited release of higher affinity adhesins (blue) from micronemes. Rapid upregulation of microneme secretion then occurs; the adhesins interact with a sub-plasmalemmal actinomyosin system (c) and are translocated towards the posterior pole of the parasite (d) in the process driving forward motion of the parasite. The adhesins finally come into contact with a rhomboid-like protease (green) located at the posterior pole, at which point they are cleaved within their TMDs and are released (e).

parasite. On the surface of the released merozoite it exists as a noncovalently associated complex of proteolytic fragments, and it is this complex that might mediate the primary low affinity interactions between merozoite and red blood cell [10,11].

At invasion, the membrane-bound fragment of the complex is further cleaved at a single juxtamembrane site. The C-terminal product, a tandem epidermal growth factor-like domain called MSP1<sub>19</sub>, remains bound to the invading parasite surface while the rest of the MSP1 complex (which includes fragments of MSP6 and MSP7) is shed. The accumulated evidence, reviewed recently [5**,12], indicates that the parasite protease responsible for shedding is a membrane-bound calcium-dependent serine protease that is probably released onto the merozoite surface at the point of invasion and is positioned at the moving junction as it tracks back over the parasite surface (Figure 1). The molecular identity of this protease, termed merozoite surface sheddase (MESH), has proved highly elusive, although the best candidate is a large essential integral membrane subtilisin-like protease called SUB2 [13,14]. MSP1 is essential for blood-stage growth [15,16] and is expressed and processed as described above in all *Plasmodium* species examined. Shedding of MSP1 is a prerequisite for invasion [17] so selective low molecular weight inhibitors of MESH might have the potential to be developed as antimalarial drugs. The function of the other MSPs referred to above and their fate at invasion are unknown. However, for reasons explained below it is possible that MESH might also mediate shedding of other MSPs during invasion.

Proteolytic processing of *Plasmodium* apical membrane antigen-1

Just before invasion, an integral membrane protein called apical membrane antigen-1 (AMA1) is secreted from micronemes onto the merozoite surface. AMA1 has received great attention for several reasons. First, as with MSP1, antibodies to AMA1 can prevent invasion and can protect against blood-stage parasitaemia *in vivo*. Second, AMA1 appears to be essential for blood-stage growth [18] and is also expressed in sporozoites, in which it plays a similarly important role in invasion [19]. Third, the recently described X-ray crystal structure of AMA1 shows that its ectodomain consists of three distinct domains, two of which belong to the PAN module family, a group of proteins often implicated in protein–protein or protein–carbohydrate interactions [20**]. Fourth, electron microscopic analysis of merozoites that have been prevented from undergoing invasion by the presence of anti-AMA1 antibodies has indicated that AMA1 plays a role in reorientation of the parasite or in junction formation [21**]. Other studies that use heterologous expression systems

have suggested that AMA1 (or sub-domains of it) has red blood cell-binding activity [22,23]. Finally, AMA1 has clear homologues in other apicomplexan genera (unlike MSP1, which is restricted to *Plasmodium*), in which it has also been the subject of considerable interest.

AMA1 is substantially post-translationally proteolytically modified in at least two steps. The first of these occurs at, or just before, secretion from micronemes and involves loss of a short N-terminal region, which is referred to as the prosequence [24]. This seems to be an important process [25], but neither the function of prosequence removal nor the protease that is responsible are known. Second, the resulting truncated molecule, which in the case of *Plasmodium falciparum* is a 66 kDa protein called PfAMA1₆₆, moves onto the parasite surface where it presumably mediates its function during invasion and from where it is eventually shed as a result of a further juxtamembrane cleavage. Although the cleavage site shares no obvious similarity with that in MSP1, this shedding is also mediated by MESH in *P. falciparum* [26**]. Similar to the case of MSP1, shedding of AMA1 might be required for productive invasion as antibodies that interfere with shedding also inhibit invasion [27,28**].

### Proteolytic processing of other microneme proteins and rhomboids

Whether or not AMA1 plays a predominantly adhesive role in invasion is still unclear, but one group of micronemal proteins that definitely does have such a role is a set of transmembrane adhesins that includes the so-called TRAP family (named after its prototypic sporozoite member—thrombospondin-related anonymous protein). These proteins have been extensively studied in several apicomplexan genera. In what has turned out to be a ground-breaking observation, Soldati and co-workers [29] noticed that proteolytic shedding of TgMIC6, a transmembrane adhesion of the *Toxoplasma gondii* tachyzoite, takes place by cleavage not adjacent to but within its predicted transmembrane domain (TMD). Moreover, the site of cleavage is flanked by several residues that showed an intriguing degree of homology across the TRAP family and many other microneme integral membrane proteins. Previous work by Carruthers *et al.* [30] had indicated that the protease (called microneme protein protease 1 or MPP1) involved in shedding of the *Toxoplasma* TRAP homologue, TgMIC2, had characteristics of a serine protease. These two sets of observations were eventually resolved by the work of Urban and Freeman [31**], who showed that the TMD of both TgMIC2 and TgMIC6, as well as that of another adhesin TgMIC12, are substrates for a family of novel intramembrane proteases called rhomboids, which were originally discovered in *Drosophila*.

A flurry of activity in this area has followed this discovery. Mutational analyses have shown that shedding of TgMIC2 is necessary for productive invasion [32**];

mass-spectrometric mapping of the TgMIC2 cleavage site confirmed it to lie within the luminal half of the TMD, which is typical of a rhomboid cleavage [33*]; and bioinformatic analyses demonstrated the presence of a family of putative rhomboid genes in Apicomplexa [34*,35**]. Of the six rhomboids encoded by the *T. gondii* genome, four (TgROM1, TgROM2, TgROM4 and TgROM5) are expressed in tachyzoites [35**,36**]; TgROM1 localises to the micronemes, both TgROM4 and TgROM5 are expressed at the parasite surface, and TgROM5 appears to be spatially restricted to the posterior end of the parasite—a localisation predicted of MPP1 (Figure 2). Both TgROM4 and TgROM5 possess unusually large ‘loops’ that connect the transmembrane sequences typical of all rhomboids; in *P. falciparum*, they are represented by a single homologue, PfROM4 [34*,35**].

The most recent developments in this field have shown that the *T. gondii* homologue of AMA1 is shed by intramembrane cleavage mediated by a protease with an inhibitor profile typical of rhomboids. In addition, a rhomboid-like activity has been demonstrated at the plasma membrane of the *P. falciparum* merozoite, strongly suggesting that rhomboids also play a role in invasion by the malaria parasite [37*]. To date, a total of four rhomboid cleavage sites have been precisely mapped; all are from Apicomplexa and all lie on the C-terminal side of an Ala residue [29,33*,37*].

### Conclusions

Although elucidation of the role of rhomboids in *Toxoplasma* has progressed rapidly, the substrates cleaved by this class of proteases during red cell invasion by the malaria merozoite remain unidentified. Sequence alignments show that members of the Duffy-binding ligand-erythrocyte binding proteins (DBL-EBP) family, a set of *Plasmodium* microneme adhesins that are known to play a key role in invasion, possess highly conserved TMDs, which include the GA or GG motif implicated in rhomboid recognition [5*]. These proteins have long been known to be shed in a fully soluble form at invasion, but the mechanism and physiological significance of this shedding have not been investigated. A TRAP family member has also recently been identified in merozoites—PTRAMP [38]. This relocalises from merozoites onto the parasite surface before invasion, but its subsequent fate and function is unknown. This area is likely to be one of significant activity in the near future. On a similar note, it remains unclear whether *Toxoplasma* or other apicomplexan parasites use a sheddase at invasion that is functionally equivalent to MESH, although subtilisin-like proteases that could mediate such a role have been identified in *T. gondii* and in *Neospora* [39].

Proteases are amongst the best-characterised of all enzymes. The past two years have seen a substantial

resurgence of interest in the role of these enzymes in invasion by apicomplexan pathogens, and there is undoubtedly potential for the development of inhibitors of MESH and of rhomboids to be developed as antimalarial drugs.
