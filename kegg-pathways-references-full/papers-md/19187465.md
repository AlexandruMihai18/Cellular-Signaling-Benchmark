It is increasingly evident that 17β-oestradiol (E₂), via a distinct membrane oestrogen receptor (Gq-mER), can rapidly activate kinase pathways to have multiple downstream actions in central nervous system (CNS) neurones. We have found that E₂ can rapidly reduce the potency of the GABAₐ receptor agonist baclofen and mu-opioid receptor agonist DAMGO to activate G-protein-coupled, inwardly rectifying K⁺ (GIRK) channels in hypothalamic neurones, thereby increasing the excitability (firing activity) of pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) and dopamine neurones. These effects are mimicked by the membrane impermeant E₂-BSA and a new ligand (STX) that is selective for the Gq-mER that does not bind to ERα or ERβ. Both E₂ and STX are fully efficacious in attenuating the GABAₐ response in ERα, ERβ and GPR 30 knockout mice in an ICI 182 780 reversible manner. These findings are further proof that E₂ signals through a unique plasma membrane ER. We have characterised the coupling of this Gq-mER to a Gq-mediated activation of phospholipase C leading to the up-regulation of protein kinase Cδ and protein kinase A activity in these neurones, which ultimately alters gene transcription. Finally, as proof of principle, we have found that STX, similar to E₂, reduces food intake and body weight gain in ovariectomised females. STX, presumably via the Gq-mER, also regulates gene expression of a number of relevant targets including cation channels and signalling molecules that are critical for regulating (as a prime example) POMC neuronal excitability. Therefore, E₂ can activate multiple receptor-mediated pathways to modulate excitability and gene transcription in CNS neurones that are critical for controlling homeostasis and motivated behaviors.

Oestrogen receptors (ER) regulate cellular function through at least two signalling pathways previously broadly classified as 'genomic' versus 'nongenomic' (1, 2). Recently, a more appropriate terminology was suggested. Hammes and Levin (3) suggested 'nuclear-initiated steroid signalling' for genomic signalling pathways, and 'membrane-initiated steroid signalling' for rapid, nongenomic pathways. Under nuclear-initiated signalling, E₂, via ERα and ERβ, exerts diverse effects on a variety of tissues that involves gene stimulation as well as gene repression (4–9). In general, this 'classical' signalling pathway of E₂ involves steroid-dependent formation of nuclear ER homo- or heterodimers and the subsequent binding of this complex with a unique DNA sequence known as an oestrogen response element (ERE), in E₂-responsive gene promoters (10–12). There is also compelling evidence that ERα and ERβ can regulate transcription of some of these 'oestrogen-responsive' genes by interacting with other DNA-bound transcription factors, such as specificity protein-1 and activator protein 1, rather than binding directly to DNA (12–14).

However, over 30 years ago, the rapid electrophysiological effects of E₂ were documented (15) and, at the same time, E₂ membrane binding sites on endometrial cells were identified (16, 17). Subsequently, high affinity binding of [³H]-17β-oestradiol was demonstrated in synaptosomal membranes prepared from the adult rat brain (18). It is now generally accepted that membrane-initiated signalling of E₂ in the brain does not require nuclear targeting of ERs (3, 19, 20). This type of E₂ signalling occurs at the plasma
membrane to trigger intracellular signalling events that result in gene transcription and alterations in neuronal activity. New gene transcription results from E₂ activation of multiple intracellular kinase cascades, including mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), cAMP-protein kinase (PKA) and protein kinase C (PKC) pathways (21–25). For example, E₂ rapidly up-regulates cAMP in hypothalamic neurones by increasing adenyl cyclase activity (26), which in turn activates PKA. PKA phosphorylates cAMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB) and elicits new gene transcription (27–30). Genes with CRE binding sites are activated rapidly in neurones independent of ER interacting with EREs including genes encoding neurotransmitters such as dopamine, enkephalin, dynorphin and neurotensin (28, 29). In this review, we describe a novel, putative membrane ER that is a Gq-coupled G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) functionally characterised in arcuate pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurones and how the classical ER and this novel Gq-linked membrane ER (Gq-mER) interact through nuclear-initiated and membrane-initiated signalling pathways. Recent data suggest that oestrogenic gene regulation and channel modulation is a multiple-receptor mediated mechanism, which synergistically controls hypothalamic functions during the ovulatory cycle.

### Membrane-initiating signalling of E₂ on hypothalamic arcuate neurones

Previous reviews have described the acute, membrane-initiated signalling actions of E₂ in the brain through multiple signalling pathways (20, 31, 32) including G-protein-activated pathways (33). At least some of these rapid actions of E₂ cannot be attributed to classical nuclear-initiated steroid signalling of ERα or ERβ. There are several potential candidates for novel membrane ERs including ER-X and two GPCRs, GPR30 and Gq-mER (34–39); therefore, it is evident that E₂ can rapidly alter cell function through ERα, ERβ and/or novel ERs.

Compelling evidence has been generated in the support of a Gq-mER. Intracellular and whole cell recording from guinea pig and mouse hypothalamic slices have been used to characterise the Gq-mER (26, 35, 37). In these studies, E₂ acts stereospecifically to significantly attenuate the potency of μ-opioid and GABA<sub>B</sub> agonists in activating an inwardly rectifying K⁺ conductance within physiologically-relevant concentrations (EC<sub>50</sub> = 8 nM) in arcuate POMC neurones (26, 35). Oestrogenic modulation of μ-opioid and GABA<sub>B</sub> agonists potency is mimicked either by stimulation of adenyl cyclase with forskolin or by direct PKA activation with Sp-cAMP (26, 35). Furthermore, selective antagonists of PKA block the effects of E₂. The activation of PKA is downstream in a signalling cascade that is initiated by the Gq-mER that is linked to activation of phospholipase C (PLC) and PKC (35, 37). Importantly, the anti-oestrogens ICI 164,384 and ICI 182,780 block the actions of E₂ with subnanomolar affinity that is similar to the affinity of ICI (K<sub>i</sub>) for ERα (26, 40). The selective ER modulators (SERMs), 4-OH tamoxifen and raloxifene all behave like E₂ in mediating this response.

We have formulated the signal transduction pathway for the rapid response to E₂ in arcuate neurones. The sequence of events in this model (Fig. 1) comprises: (i) E₂ binds to a novel transmembrane ER and activates Gαq; (ii) activated Gαq in turn activates PLC which hydrolyses phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP₂) and liberates diacylglycerol (DAG); (iii) free DAG stimulates PKCδ, and PKCδ activates adenylyl cyclase (VII); (iv) cAMP levels are elevated and stimulate PKA, which through phosphorylation uncouples the inhibitory GABA<sub>B</sub> and μ-opioid receptors from activation of G-protein-coupled, inwardly rectifying K⁺ (GIRK) channels (35). Furthermore, activated PKA will phosphorylate CREB to initiate gene expression via CRE (5) and inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP₃) may release calcium through the IP₃ receptor on the endoplasmic reticulum (6). Oestradiol will also bind to nuclear receptors and activate ERE-dependent transcription (7). Other transcriptional pathways that the Gq-mER may activate include the MAPK and calcium-sensitive pathways through PKC and IP₃. Recently, we have characterised the signalling of a nonsteroidal compound, STX, that specifically targets the G-protein-coupled signalling pathway in both male and female arcuate neurones. STX has a greater affinity (approximately 20-fold) for the Gq-mER than E₂ (37).

Because many of the rapid effects of E₂ can be induced by selective ERα or ERβ ligands, antagonised by the ER antagonist, ICI 182 780, or are lost in animals bearing mutations in ERα and/or ERβ genes (5, 41–45), it has been suggested that the membrane-associated ERs might be derived from the same genes as ERα and ERβ (45–48). However, the Gq-mER is not ERα or ERβ because it is activated by STX, which does not bind to ERα or ERβ (35, 37) and has no proliferative effects on reproductive organs (37). STX (and E₂) also activates the Gαq signalling pathway in mice lacking either ERα, ERβ or both of these nuclear receptors (37). Our findings indicate that the Gq-mER in hypothalamic arcuate (POMC) neurones is distinct from ERα or ERβ. Definitive characterisation of this Gq-mER awaits cloning of the gene.

Toran-Allerand et al. (49) identified a high-affinity, saturable ER, ER-X, that is associated with caveolar-like microdomains in developing neocortical neurones. In organotypic explants of the developing cerebral cortex, E₂ induces tyrosine phosphorylation of both ERK1 (extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 1) and ERK2, an action very similar to a number of growth factors including nerve growth factor (34). Interestingly, ER-X also has a distinct pharmacology in that 17α-oestradiol is equipotent as E₂ in activating the MAPK/ERK pathway (43, 49). However, 17α-oestradiol has no effect on the GABA<sub>B</sub> response (35), nor on the μ-opioid response, which are both coupled to the same family of GIRK channels in hypothalamic neurones (50). Similarly, Gu and Moss (51) found that 17α-oestradiol did not mimic the actions of E₂ in the hippocampus to potentiate the glutamate (kainate)-mediated currents in CA1 pyramidal neurones. Therefore, it appears that the Gq-mER that modulates channel activity in neurones via the PKC-PKA pathway is pharmacologically distinct from the receptor (ER-X) that is coupled to activation of ERK1 and ERK2 to promote growth and survival.

The orphan GPCR, GPR30, is a new ER involved in the rapid actions elicited by E₂ in peripheral reproductive tissue (36, 52). In transfected breast cancer cells, E₂ activates ERK1 and ERK2

Fig. 1. Activation of an oestrogen-responsive G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) and the associated signalling pathways in arcuate neurones. (1) The putative Gq-membrane oestrogen receptor (mER) is a G-protein coupled receptor linked to $G\alpha_{q/11}$ protein. Oestrogen binding activates the $G\alpha_{q/11}$ (2) which in turn activates (+) phospholipase C (PLC) and initiates the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate ($PIP_2$). PLC hydrolyzes $PIP_2$ into diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate ($IP_3$). (3) DAG activates protein kinase Cδ (PKCδ) which activates adenylate cyclase VII (AC VII). (4) AC VII increases cAMP production subsequently stimulating protein kinase A (PKA), which through phosphorylation uncouples the inhibitory $GABA_B$ and $\mu$-opioid receptors from activation of G-protein-coupled, inwardly rectifying $K^+$ (GIRK) channels. (5) Activation of PKA will also phosphorylate cAMP-responsive element binding protein (pCREB) and control gene expression through the CREB response element (CRE). (6) $IP_3$ produced from the hydrolysis of $PIP_2$ activates $Ca^{2+}$ release from the endoplasmic reticulum that can activate calcium-dependent signalling.

independently of ERα or ERβ (38, 53). In these cells, $E_2$ activates $G\beta\gamma$-subunits that promote the release and activation of an epidermal growth factor precursor (proHB-EGF). The active HB-EGF binds to the EGF receptor (ErbB) to facilitate receptor dimerisation and downstream activation of ERK (53–55). GPR30 is localised to endoplasmic reticulum and binds $E_2$ with nanomolar affinity (36). Previously, the expression of GPR30 in the brain including the hypothalamus has been reported (39, 56, 56–59). In recent studies, GPR30 mRNA was detected in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and supraoptic nucleus (59) and in magnocellular optic tract neurones (60). However, the pharmacology of GPR30 in these neurones has not been characterised. Previously, we have established that $E_2$ is fully efficacious in attenuating the $GABA_B$ response in arcuate (POMC) neurones from GPR30 knockout mice, suggesting that GPR30 is not the Gq-mER signalling in hypothalamic POMC neurones (61).

**Activation of the Gq-mER in the arcuate nucleus affects energy homeostasis and gene expression**

Oestradiol is involved in the regulation of appetite, energy expenditure, body weight, adipose tissue deposition and distribution in females (62–64). Ovariectomy induces an increase in food intake which is reversed with $E_2$ replacement (65–68). In fact, hypo-

Oestradiol may also control energy homeostasis by regulating gene expression of neuropeptides, cation channels and/or channel modulators (signalling molecules) via both nuclear-initiated ($\mathrm{ER} \alpha / \beta$) and membrane-initiated signalling (Gq-mER). The potential cross-talk between rapid, membrane-initiated effects of $E_{2}$ on signalling pathways (and channels) and oestrogenic gene regulation of neuropeptides, channels and signalling mechanisms ultimately determines neuronal function and activity. One probable mechanism for the control of gene expression by STX through the Gq-mER is the activation of CREB by PKA (Fig. 1). Genes containing a CREB response element in their promoter regions are potential targets for STX-induced gene expression. However, recent data also suggest that cAMP can activate $\mathrm{ER} \alpha$ and initiate ERE-mediated transcription via $\mathrm{ER} \alpha$ associations with CREB and CREB binding protein (81, 82). Other potential transcriptional mechanisms include MAPK activation via PKC, calmodulin (CaM)-CaMKII activation via IP3-induced calcium release (Fig. 1) and PI3K-Akt activation (83). To measure gene regulation via the Gq-mER using STX, we employed custom gene microarray analysis of arcuate tissue from STX-treated female guinea pigs coupled to a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. The analysis of gene expression with STX was used to evaluate the membrane-initiated versus nuclear-initiated signalling of $E_{2}$. Because the Gq-mER activates signalling molecules that may impinge on channel function (PLC, PI3K, PKC and PKA) (35, 83), this study was focused on the gene regulation of cation channels, signalling molecules and associated genes. As predicted, several relevant genes were regulated in the arcuate nucleus by long-term STX treatment.

Of particular interest in the context of energy homeostasis is the regulation of neuropeptide Y (NPY) from these orexigenic neurones. We have recently demonstrated that STX significantly reduces NPY mRNA expression in the arcuate nucleus (79), suggesting that STX exerts some of its anorectic effects by suppressing NPY. Although the cellular mechanism is currently unknown, the anorectic effects of STX may be mediated, in part, by channel modulation in POMC neurones and the control of gene expression in NPY neurones. However, in immortalised NPY neurones, $E_{2}$ can suppress NPY gene expression via membrane-mediated PI3K-Akt signalling and via CREB-interactions with $\mathrm{ER} \alpha$ at the CRE promoter half-site (84). STX is potentially activating this CREB-CRE mediated suppression of NPY gene expression through the activation of PKA. Another possible indirect effect on NPY activity and gene expression is the increase in $\mathrm{GABA}_{\mathrm{A}}$ receptor function, which is inhibitory. $\mathrm{GABA}$ neurotransmission relies on appropriate clustering of $\mathrm{GABA}_{\mathrm{A}}$ receptors to the post-synaptic neuronal membrane. In particular, $\mathrm{GABA}_{\mathrm{A}}$ receptor targeting to the membrane is facilitated by the GEC-1 protein, which connects the receptors to the cytoskeleton and facilitates translocation to the membrane (85). Indeed, long-term $E_{2}$ and STX treatment both increased the expression of gec1, in the arcuate nucleus (79), confirming previous findings that $E_{2}$ increases gec1 mRNA expression (86). An increase in gec1 gene expression could potentiate the $\mathrm{GABA}_{\mathrm{A}}$-mediated activity in NPY neurones. The indirect modulation of $\mathrm{GABA}$ neurotransmission by $E_{2}$ (and STX) may be an inhibitory oestrogenic mechanism in hypothalamic neurones.

The second indirect mechanism to control neuronal function is the $E_{2}$-induced gene regulation of cation channels that control neuronal excitability and neurotransmitter release. We have previously shown that $E_{2}$ induces gene expression of a $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channel ($\mathrm{Ca}_{v} 3.1$) subunit in the arcuate nucleus after $24 \mathrm{~h}$ of treatment (87) and after long-term $E_{2}$ treatment (30 days) (79). The $E_{2}$-induced increase in $\mathrm{Ca}_{v} 3.1$ subunit expression has previously been demonstrated to increase the peak T-type $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ current by two-fold in arcuate neurones, including POMC neurones (87) and increased the magnitude of voltage-dependent calcium currents unidentified neurones in the ventromedial hypothalamus (88). Furthermore, the increase in $\mathrm{Ca}_{v} 3.1$ expression in the arcuate nucleus from $E_{2}$ treatment does not occur in $\mathrm{ER} \alpha$ knockout mice (89) indicating that the expression is under the control of the nuclear receptor. However, STX also significantly up-regulates the $\mathrm{Ca}_{v} 3.1$ subunit in the arcuate nucleus after long-term treatment (79), suggesting that these two receptor-mediated transcriptional effects converge at the $\mathrm{Ca}_{v} 3.1$ gene. Because the Gq-mER signalling pathway is found in POMC neurones, one can postulate that the up-regulation after STX-treatment is occurring in these neurones.

Furthermore, the increase in the T-type $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ current facilitates the burst firing of neurones and causes an increase in neurotransmitter and secretory protein ($\alpha$-melanocyte-stimulating hormone) release (90). However, in order to deactivate the T-type current, the neurones must be hyperpolarised below their resting membrane potential. An obvious mechanism to generate a hyperpolarised state is to up-regulate the expression of inhibitory ionotropic receptors and/or $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ channels. One such ionotropic receptor that STX up-regulates is the glycine receptor (91). STX increased the expression of the glycine receptor $\beta$ subunit, which is the structural subunit for this ligand-gated $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ channel. Glycine is a major inhibitory neurotransmitter and initiates a post-synaptic increase in chloride conductance through this receptor (92). $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ channels also function to hyperpolarise neurones. We have previously reported that $E_{2}$ treatment will increase the gene expression of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ channel subunits that control neuronal excitability in the guinea pig arcuate nucleus (91). $E_{2}$ treatment increases the mRNA expression of the KCNQ5 channel subunit that underlies the M-current and the inwardly-rectifying $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ (Kir) channel Kir2.4 subunit. The M-current controls neuronal excitability by constitutively hyperpolarising the cell membrane (93) whereas the Kir2 family is the prime determinant of the resting membrane potential (94, 95). Both of these currents are modulated by GPCRs that activate the PIP2-PLC-PKC and PKA signalling pathways (93–98). The modulation of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ channels by PKA is controlled by docking with the scaffold protein, A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAP) (50). In the arcuate nucleus, $E_{2}$ down-regulated AKAP11 after $24 \mathrm{~h}$ and long-term treatment (79, 91); however, long-term STX treatment increases the expression of the AKAP11 (79). The regulation of this gene by $E_{2}$ or STX may affect PKA regulation of numerous $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ channels, including those discussed in this review.

As stated, STX via the Gq-mER potentially activates a host of signalling pathways. Many of these signalling proteins, which are involved in the modulation of channel activity and gene expression, are also transcriptional targets for both the nuclear ER and Gq-mER receptors. For example, genes involved in calcium signalling
pathways are regulated by E₂ and STX treatment. Oestradiol treatment, both 24 h and long-term, increases the expression of CaM-1 in the arcuate nucleus (79, 91). STX does not regulate calmodulin but does regulate the CaM-dependent kinase, CaMKII. CaMKII is a modulator of ion channels (Ca²⁺, K⁺, Na⁺) (99) and is required for the Ca²⁺-sensitive production of long-term potentiation in neurones from the hypothalamus (100). The regulation of these calcium signalling molecules may have multiple effects on gene expression, neuronal excitability and synaptic neurotransmitter release.

The PI3K pathway and its associated proteins are also a target for gene regulation by both E₂ and STX. Peripheral signals such as leptin and insulin activate PI3K via insulin receptor substrate in POMC neurones (101). Furthermore, the rapid attenuation of GIRK channel activity in POMC neurones by E₂ involves the activation of PI3K (83). Oestradiol has recently been shown to up-regulate PI3K p85α in the dorsomedial portion of the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (adjacent to the arcuate nucleus) after 24 h of treatment but not in the arcuate nucleus. However, E₂ up-regulated p55γ expression in the arcuate nucleus (83). Conversely, STX up-regulates the p85α subunit of PI3K and phosphatidylinositol transfer protein β (PITPβ) in the arcuate nucleus. PITPβ transports lipids (phosphatidylinositols) from their site of synthesis (endoplasmic reticulum) to the cellular membrane where they are the preferred substrates for the lipid kinases (PI3K, PI4K, etc.) (102). Not only is PITPβ activity required for PI3K, but this protein is also necessary for PLC-mediated signalling (103). Because PI3K- and PLC-mediated signalling are implicated in the membrane-mediated effects of E₂ and other factors that control energy homeostasis in POMC neurones (leptin, insulin, etc.), any changes in activity or expression of the transfer proteins may be another indirect mechanism for E₂ to potentiate the effects of these peripheral signals on energy homeostasis.

### Conclusions

The gonadal steroid E₂ participates in numerous functions including reproduction, feeding, neuroprotection and cognition. The classical actions of E₂ are to regulate gene transcription through binding to and activating nuclear receptors that stimulate or inhibit gene transcription at specific DNA binding sites. However, recently, it has become clear that E₂ can exert its action through multiple signalling mechanisms, including membrane-initiated steroid signalling. In this review, we have summarised the evidence for E₂ activating a novel hypothalamic signal transduction pathway for the control of neuronal excitability and gene transcription that is initiated by a Gq-mER. This novel pathway is in addition to the classical ERE-mediated and non-ERE-mediated transcriptional pathways that have been extensively investigated in central and peripheral tissues. The activation of the Gq-mER provides an additional mechanism for E₂ to control gene expression not involving the classical ERs. Activations of the putative hypothalamic Gq-mER via STX is associated not only with new gene transcription, but also with attenuation in post-ovariectomy body weight gain in a dose-dependent manner. STX is currently being examined in other homeostatic functions and may be an excellent tool to delineate the effects of the Gq-mER on these hypothalamic functions. The Gq-mER clearly is a coupling mechanism between the control of gene transcription and rapid signalling events that, together, will ultimately determine the effects of E₂ on hypothalamic functions. Furthermore, we are beginning to understand the cross-talk between rapid signalling events and changes in gene expression. However, many challenges lie ahead before we can fully identify the nature of membrane steroid receptors, functional properties and integration with nuclear steroid receptors.
