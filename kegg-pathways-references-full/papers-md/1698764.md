Bluensomycin (glebomycin) is an aminocyclitol antibiotic that differs structurally from dihydrostreptomycin in having bluensidine (1D-1-O-carbamoyl-3-guanidinodeoxy-scyllo-inositol) rather than streptidine (1,3-diguanidino-1,3-dideoxy-scyllo-inositol) as its aminocyclitol moiety. Extracts of the bluensomycin producer *Streptomyces hygroscopicus* form glebosus ATCC 14607 (*S.* glebosus) were found to have aminodeoxy-scyllo-inositol kinase activity but to lack 1D-1-guanidino-3-amino-1,3-dideoxy-scyllo-inositol kinase activity, showing for the first time that these two reactions in streptomycin producers must be catalyzed by different enzymes. *S.* glebosus extracts therefore possess the same five enzymes required for synthesis of guanidinodexoy-scyllo-inositol from myo-inositol that are found in streptomycin producers but lack the next three of the four enzymes found in streptomycin producers that are required to synthesize the second guanidino group of streptidine-P. In place of a second guanidino group, *S.* glebosus extracts were found to catalyze a Mg²⁺-dependent carbamoylation of guanidinodexoy-scyllo-inositol to form bluensidine, followed by a phosphorylation to form bluensidine-P. The novel carbamoyl-P:guanidinodexoy-scyllo-inositol O-carbamoyltransferase and ATP:bluensidine phosphotransferase activities were not detected in streptomycin producers or in *S.* glebosus during its early rapid growth phase. Free bluensidine appears to be a normal intermediate in bluensomycin biosynthesis, in contrast to the case of streptomycin biosynthesis; in the latter, although exogenous streptidine can enter the pathway via streptidine-P, free streptidine is not an intermediate in the endogenous biosynthetic pathway. Comparison of the streptomycin and bluensomycin biosynthetic pathways provides a unique opportunity to evaluate those proposed mechanisms for the evolutionary acquisition of new biosynthetic capabilities that involve gene duplication and subsequent mutational changes in one member of the pair. In this model, there are at least five pairs of enzymes catalyzing analogous reactions that can be analyzed for homology at both the protein and DNA levels, including two putative pairs of inositol kinases detected in this study.

Actinomycete soil bacteria have a large excess of DNA in their genomes over that required for growth and morphological differentiation. Much of this excess DNA codes for enzymes responsible for the unique biosynthetic abilities of actinomycetes, which as a group produce 70% of the known antibiotics plus numerous other idiolites (secondary metabolites). The mechanisms and selection procedures by which the diverse pathways for idiolite biosynthesis have evolved and are maintained are problems of both theoretical and practical interest. Model systems for addressing these problems must be amenable to both enzymatic and genetic analysis. The streptomycin biosynthetic pathway fulfills these two requirements for a model system (32).

Enzymatic studies on biosynthesis of the streptidine moiety of dihydrostreptomycin (Fig. 1, I) have provided evidence that an unusual sequence of five reactions converts an inositol hydroxyl group to the first guanidino group; the second guanidino group is then formed by a second mechanistically similar sequence of five reactions (21, 28, 29, 31, 33–35). Studies of mutants blocked in streptidine biosynthesis have subsequently provided independent support for the proposed enzymatic pathway (6, 12, 15). In related genetic studies (5, 7, 10, 16, 19), a streptomycin biosynthetic gene cluster has been found which contains genes coding for (i) streptomycin 6-kinase, originally detected as streptidine kinase activity with a biosynthetic function under certain conditions (30); (ii) amidinotransferase, the first pathway enzyme discovered (26); and (iii) several other putative biosynthetic and regulatory activities.

The remarkable symmetry of the streptidine biosynthetic pathway led to my early speculation that gene duplication and subsequent divergence might have provided the additional enzymes required to synthesize the second guanidino group (20). It was soon recognized that such evolutionary speculation would be greatly strengthened if (i) evidence could be obtained for the existence of the postulated progenitor single guanidino pathway; (ii) corresponding reactions of the two analogous biosynthetic sequences responsible for streptidine synthesis could be shown to be catalyzed by different enzymes, with in some cases overlapping substrate specificities; and (iii) the predicted DNA and amino acid sequence homologies could be detected in both the progenitor and streptomycin producers. Our laboratory has been concerned with the enzymatic aspects of this problem (items i and ii), since DNA sequences must ultimately be correlated with activities of their gene products.

Bluensomycin (glebomycin) (Fig 1, II) differs structurally from dihydrostreptomycin in having an O-carbamoyl group at position 1 rather than a second guanidino group (1, 2, 13, 17), and hence it is a logical candidate for the postulated progenitor compound. Previous studies revealed that extracts of the bluensomycin producer *Streptomyces hygroscopicus* form glebosus ATCC 14607 (*S.* glebosus) catalyzed reactions C, D, F, G, and K of Fig. 2, whereas reactions E, H, I, and J were not detected (22). Incubation of nondialyzed extracts of *S.* glebosus with [guanidino-¹⁴C]arginine and carbamoyl-P gave labeled compounds identified as [guanidino-¹⁴C]guanidinodexoy-scyllo-inositol-P (IG-P) and [gua-

However, no carbamoylation reaction was detected. It was suggested that perhaps carbamoylation might occur at an early step, a hypothesis strengthened by the occurrence of the dicarbamoylated inositol antibiotics myomycin (8) and boholmycin (18), and that enzymes C, D, and/or F might permit such a substitution.

Since enzyme E was not detected, it was considered possible that enzyme E might require a carbamoylated substrate. In this scenario, enzyme G would serve an editing function to remove noncarbamoylated intermediates, and IG-P would be a nonenzymatic degradation product of IGC-P formed during isolation (22).

The purpose of this investigation was to develop simple and reproducible enzymatic assays that would help determine how IGC-P is synthesized by *S. glebosus*. In particular, it was important to determine which reactions were identical for both the IGC-P and streptidine-P pathways and which reactions were unique to their respective pathways. The surprising findings are summarized in Fig. 2.

### MATERIALS AND METHODS

#### Materials
The bluensomycin producer *S. glebosus* and the streptomycin producers *Streptomyces griseus* ATCC 12475 and *Streptomyces bikiniensis* ATCC 11062 came from the American Type Culture Collection. Microbiological media came from Difco Laboratories. ScintiLene LSC for radioactive counting came from Fisher Scientific Co. Dowex 50(H⁺) × 8, 200/400 mesh, cation-exchange resin, and Bio-Gel P-6DG desalting gel came from Bio-Rad Laboratories. *Escherichia coli* alkaline phosphatase type III, MgATP, and lithium and sodium salts of carbamoyl-P came from Sigma Chemical Co. \[^{14}C\]carbamoyl-P (13.8 mCi/mmol) came from Dupont, NEN Research Products. L-[guanidino-\[^{14}C\]]arginine (54 mCi/mmol) came from Amersham Corp. Aminodeoxy-scyllo-[1-\[^{14}C\]]inositol (IN; 3.5 mCi/mmol) came from California Binuclear Corp. and from Mallinckrodt, Inc. [guanidino-\[^{14}C\]]guanidinodeoxy-scyllo-inositol (IG) was prepared by two methods: (i) IG-P was isolated by Dowex 50 column chromatography (34) from *S. griseus* or *S. bikiniensis* sonicate supernatants after incubation with [guanidino-\[^{14}C\]]arginine plus dilithium carbamoyl-P and deproteinization with trichloroacetic acid and then was incubated with *E. coli* alkaline phosphatase to give labeled IG, which was separated on a Dowex 50 column; and (ii) a mixture of IG-P and IGC-P was isolated by Dowex 50 column chromatography from *S. glebosus* sonicate supernatants after incubation with [guanidino-\[^{14}C\]]arginine plus dilithium carbamoyl-P and deproteinization with trichloroacetic acid, hydrolyzed with 6 N HCl for 24 h at 100°C, and evaporated to dryness, and the labeled IG product was separated by Dowex 50 column chromatography and HCl elution as before. A mixture of [guanidino-\[^{14}C\]]bluensidine (IGC) and IG was prepared from a mixture of their respective phosphate esters obtained as in method ii by treatment with *E. coli* alkaline phosphatase followed by separation on Dowex 50 columns as before. [guanidino-\[^{14}C\]]1D-1-guanidino-3-amino-1,3-dideoxy-scyllo-inositol (IGN) was prepared by incubation under aerobic conditions of an *S. bikiniensis* or *S. griseus* sonicate supernatant with IG and L-alanine (reactions H plus I), deproteinizing, and separating the product on Dowex 50 columns (28, 34). Bluensomycin was provided by Brian Bannister of The Upjohn Co. Nonlabeled IG was prepared by acid hydrolysis of bluensomycin (1, 13), followed by separation on Dowex 50 as before.

#### Growth of cultures
Stock cultures were grown and maintained at room temperature on slants of yeast malt extract agar (Difco 0770-01; ISP medium 2). *S. glebosus* cultures were grown on slants for 10 to 13 days and then transferred to 2-liter Erlenmeyer flasks containing 500 ml of 0.05% glucose–0.5% myo-inositol–1% tryptone–1% soytone–0.2% yeast extract–1 mM K₂HPO₄. Cultures were incubated at 27°C on a PsychroTherm rotary shaker at 250 rpm for 40 to 48 h and then harvested by suction filtration through a Whatman no. 1 filter on a Büchner funnel. The pads were rinsed and pressed dry before sonication or storage at –20°C. The faster-growing streptomycin producers were harvested at 21 to 24 h, or after 40 to 48 h when 1% maltose was added to the above-described growth medium.

#### Preparation of extracts
Fresh or frozen mycelial pads totaling about 10 g were sonicated in twice their weight of cold deionized water containing 1 mg of EDTA per ml at pH 7.4 in a 50-ml beaker in an ice bath. Sonication was performed at a power setting of 50 to 60 with the 0.5-inch (ca 1.3-cm) probe of an Ultrasonic processor (W-385; Heat Systems-Ultrasonics) for a total duration of 4.5 min, divided into three 1.5-min intervals to allow cooling. The sonic extracts were centrifuged at 27,000 × *g* for 20 min, and the supernatants were stored frozen in capped tubes at –20°C. For some experiments, low-molecular-weight metabolites and ions were removed from 3-ml samples of the supernatants by rapid desalting with a 20-ml column of Bio-Gel P-6DG at room temperature. The packing and elution medium was usually 50 mM Tris, pH 7.6.

#### Enzyme assays
Unless otherwise noted, most assays reported consisted of 5 μl of radioactive substrate (15,000 to 40,000 cpm/5 μl); 5 μl of 0.5 M Tris buffer, either pH 7.4 and containing magnesium acetate (10 mg/ml) and L-ornithine hydrochloride (20 mg/ml) for reactions E and J or pH 8.5 and containing MgCl₂ (10 mg/ml) plus dilithium carbamoyl-P (10 mg/ml) for reactions U and V; 5 μl of neutralized MgATP (30 mg/ml) for reactions E and V; and 10 μl of sonic extract supernatant. Incubation in stoppered test tubes (13 by 100 mm) was performed at 34°C, and 5-μl or (usually) 10-μl samples were spotted on Whatman no. 1 filter paper chromatograms in 5-μl increments, with drying. Ascending paper chromatography was employed, using as developing solvent 80 phenol-20 water (vol/vol) and an NH₃ atmosphere provided by adding 1 ml of concentrated NH₄OH to the inside of the jar. After 16 to 24 h, the papergrams were dried in the hood, and strips were cut at 1-cm intervals, placed in 5 ml of ScintiLene in scintillation vials, and counted.

For batch preparation of labeled pathway intermediates and substrates, the assay mixtures were scaled up approximately 100-fold. Deproteinization with trichloroacetic acid was then followed by separation of labeled compounds on 6-ml Dowex-50(H⁺) columns, with stepwise elution at increasing concentrations of HCl (29, 34).

### RESULTS

The experiments performed to determine how IGC-P is synthesized by the bluensomycin producer *S. glebosus* can best be followed by referring to the reactions and compounds depicted in Fig. 2.

#### Detection of reaction E in *S. glebosus* extracts
Since neither reaction E nor J had previously been detected in *S. glebosus* (22), it was important to determine whether enzyme E in *S. glebosus* required that its substrate be carbamoylated. Aminodeoxy-scyllo-inositol 4-kinase activity was detected in extracts of mature mycelia of *S. glebosus* (Fig. 3), just as in the case of streptomycin producers (29). Reaction E activity was not stimulated by carbamoyl-P. Presumably, changes in extract preparation and use of vanadate-free MgATP helped in the detection of reaction E in this study.

#### Evidence that reactions E and J are catalyzed by different inositol kinases
Although extracts of the streptomycin producer *S. bikiniensis* were found to catalyze both reactions E

and J, extracts of the bluensomycin producer *S. glebosus* under the same conditions catalyzed only reaction E, not reaction J (Table 1). This was the first evidence that reactions E and J might be catalyzed by different kinases.

Evidence for formation of IGC-P from IG. The occurrence of reaction E suggested that carbamoylation might occur later in the IGC-P pathway than previously suspected. Indeed, when labeled IG was incubated with MgATP plus carbamoyl-P in *S. glebosus* extracts, a compound that could not be distinguished from IGC-P was formed (Fig. 4). When carbamoyl-P was omitted, no IGC-P was formed. Moreover, when nonlabeled IG was incubated with MgATP, labeled carbamoyl-P, and a gel-desalted sonic extract of *S. glebosus*, the same labeled IGC-P compound was apparently formed along with another labeled compound with the mobility of IGC (Fig. 5). The experiments summarized in Table 2 provided additional controls with labeled IG prepared from an entirely different source. Extracts of *S. glebosus* pads harvested during the early rapid growth phase could not convert IG to IGC-P, and activity appeared only as the stationary growth phase was approached (Table 2). These are the characteristics of enzymes involved in antibiotic biosynthesis (26), not of enzymes involved in growth processes.

Detection of IGC kinase activity in *S. glebosus*. Two reactions were obviously required to convert IG to IGC-P. It was apparent that IG plus MgATP did not form IG-P (dashed curve in Fig. 4), which would have an \( R_f \) value only slightly below that of IGC-P. When a labeled IGC preparation also

### Text Description

- Containing labeled IG was incubated with *S. glebosus* extracts and MgATP; IGC-P was formed (dashed curve in Fig. 6B); addition of carbamoyl-P increased the yield of IGC-P, as the IG present was also converted to IGC-P (Fig. 6B). When freshly gel-desalted extracts of *S. glebosus* were assayed, similar results were obtained (Fig. 6C). When extracts of the streptomycin producer *S. griseus* (Fig. 6A) or *S. bikiniensis* (Fig. 6D) were the source of enzymes, no IGC-P was formed, indicating that reactions U and V were specific to bluensomycin biosynthesis. In support of this view, IGC kinase (reaction V) activity could not be detected during the early rapid growth phase of *S. glebosus* (Table 2), but only after growth had slowed and the other enzymatic activities responsible for formation of IGC-P had appeared, as evidenced by the large amount of labeled IGC-P formed from labeled arginine in the same extracts (Table 2). IGC kinase activity could be distinguished from the other inositol kinase activities (reactions E, J, and W), since extracts of streptomycin producers that possessed these latter three activities lacked reaction V activity (Fig. 6A and 6D). In addition, reaction V was not inhibited by either streptamine or dihydrostreptomycin, which inhibit reaction E or W, respectively.

- Detection of IGC synthesis from IG. Several strategies were used to detect reaction U activity, but separation of substrate from its somewhat labile product proved quite difficult. The most reproducible separation system again involved paper chromatography (Fig. 7). Conversion of guanidino-labeled IG to IGC by *S. glebosus* extracts in the presence of carbamoyl-P and MgATP occurred under conditions in which reaction V was inactive, either because of its inhibition by high P<sub>i</sub> levels (Fig. 7A) or because of its inactivation by prolonged storage at −20°C after gel desalting (Fig. 7B). Reaction U was much more stable than reaction V in the frozen state after gel desalting; conditions that might stabilize reaction V have not yet been explored. Labeled IG plus carbamoyl-P alone was not sufficient to ...

form IGC (Fig. 7C); Mg²⁺ ions were also required (Fig. 7D), and Mn²⁺ ions could substitute for Mg²⁺ ions. Evidently ATP was not required for carbamoylation in reaction U; in contrast, ATP was required for carbamoyl ester formation in cephamycin C biosynthesis by *Streptomyces clavigularis* (3). However, the Mg²⁺ ions required for reaction U could be supplied by MgATP (Fig. 7A and 7B). Other experiments (not shown) demonstrated that ring-labeled IG also was converted to IGC in the presence of carbamoyl-P and Mg²⁺ ions. Formation of labeled IGC from nonlabeled IG and labeled carbamoyl-P also was observed (Fig. 5). Citrulline did not substitute for carbamoyl-P as a carbamoyl donor. Labeled IN apparently was not carbamoylated by carbamoyl-P, as judged by no change in \( R_f \) values during incubation with *S. glebosus* extracts.

Formation of labeled IGC-P and IG-P from guanidino-labeled arginine in *S. glebosus* extracts. These conversions were greatly stimulated by carbamoyl-P (22). The role of carbamoyl-P now appears to be to convert inhibitory ornithine in these extracts to citrulline by action of ornithine carbamoyltransferase, since stimulation by carbamoyl-P also occurred in streptomycin producers and did not require Mg²⁺ ions; in addition, stimulation of transamidinations by carbamoyl-P did not occur in gel-desalted extracts of *S. glebosus*. Incorporation of label from arginine into IG-P can occur by reaction F, and incorporation into IGC-P can occur by the reaction K activity present in *S. glebosus* (22). The latter label incorporation would be analogous to a similar incorporation of label from [guanidino-¹⁴C]arginine into nonlabeled streptidine-P by reaction K (30, 33). The relative positions of the functional groups in IGC-P (Fig. 2) were assigned from the known structure of bluensomycin (Fig. 1) and the known substrate specificity of reaction K in streptomycin producers (35).

### DISCUSSION

Our current concept of the relationships between the pathways involved in biosynthesis of the streptidine moiety of streptomycin and the bluensidine moiety of bluensomycin is depicted in Fig. 2. The principal findings of this study were that (i) reaction E occurred in bluensomycin producers without the need for a carbamoylated substrate (Fig. 3); (ii) reaction J was absent from bluensomycin producers, and hence reactions E and J must be catalyzed by different inositol kinases in streptomycin producers (Table 1); (iii) the IGC-P previously observed in extracts of bluensomycin producers (22) was synthesized from IG in two steps (Fig. 4), the first an O-carbamoylation reaction (U) (Fig. 5) that required carbamoyl-P and Mg²⁺ ions (Fig. 7), followed by a new inositol kinase reaction (V) that converted IGC plus MgATP to IGC-P (Fig. 6); and (iv) reactions U and V could not be detected in extracts of streptomycin producers (Fig. 6) or in extracts from early-log-phase mycelia of bluensomycin producers (Table 2), indicating that these reactions were specific for bluensomycin biosynthesis. In Fig. 2 it is suggested that free bluensidine is a normal pathway intermediate in bluensomycin biosynthesis, whereas free streptidine is not on the endogenous pathway for streptomycin biosynthesis, although exogenous streptidine can enter the pathway by reaction W (30).

It would therefore appear that the pathways for biosynthesis of streptomycin and bluensomycin are identical from myo-inositol to IG as the last common intermediate. Streptomycin producers lack enzymes U and V, whereas bluensomycin producers lack enzymes H, I, and now J. Both producers catalyze reaction K (22, 23). It would be interesting to determine whether insertion of genes coding for enzymes U and V into the A-5 streptidineless idiotype of Nagaoka and Demain (12), which we found to lack enzyme H (23), would produce 3′-dehydrobluensomycin or its phosphate.

Possible evolutionary relationships between bluensomycin and streptomycin pathways. My findings that the pathways for biosynthesis of both IGC-P and streptidine-P are apparently identical from myo-inositol to IG (Fig. 2) supports the occurrence in bluensomycin producers of the postulated progenitor single guanidino pathway mentioned in the introduction, which by gene duplication and divergence (or by other means) might have given rise to genes coding for synthesis of a second guanidino group. On the other hand, if the carbamoylation step had been found to occur at an earlier step in IGC-P synthesis, as was previously thought, the pathway segments would not have been identical for the two antibiotics, and bluensomycin producers would be less likely to represent the putative ancestral progenitor of the streptomycin pathway. In any event, a rational basis has now been established for the future comparisons of DNA and amino acid sequence homologies of corresponding reactions in the bluensomycin and streptomycin biosynthetic pathways, which include reactions C through G, reactions L through N, and reactions V and W.

Candidate reaction pairs for DNA sequence homology comparisons in the streptidine-P pathway. In the biosynthesis of streptidine-P, direct or indirect evidence has indicated that the following analogous reactions are catalyzed by different enzymes, some with overlapping substrate specificities (cf. Fig. 2): (i) the two dehydrogenations, C and H (22); (ii) the two transaminations, D and I (31); (iii) the two kinases, E and J (Table 2); and (iv) two phosphatases, G and N (35), although it is equally likely that reaction G should be paired with myo-inositol-P phosphatase instead of reaction N (24). Since bluensomycin producers have both transamidination activities, F and K (22), and apparently can also engage in exchange transamidinations with IGC-P, it is not yet clear whether one or two amidinotransferase enzymes are involved. If enzyme F is also intrinsically capable of catalyzing reaction K, duplication of gene F might have occurred (10) but be superfluous for streptidine-P synthesis. Similar considerations might apply to the case of the participation of one or two enzymes D in the biosynthesis of 2-deoxystreptamine (9). With DNA sequences of genes coding for enzymes C through G, plus V, from a bluensomycin producer as reference standards, it should be possible to identify and distinguish homologous pairs of genes in the genomes of streptomycin producers which code for each of the analogous reaction pairs noted above, plus enzyme W for comparison with enzyme V.

Possible selection pressures for evolutionary acquisition and maintenance of these biosynthetic pathways. Selection pressures must exist for early as well as late steps during the evolution of long and complex idiolytic biosynthetic pathways (36). One possible scenario is that the guanidinated inositol derivatives of Fig. 2 can serve as nutrient storage reserves, which can be readily utilized only by the producing organisms during starvation and differentiation. Such intermediates would be sources of energy, nitrogen, phosphate, and carbon. *S. glebosus* can grow on myo-inositol as the primary carbon and energy source (14), and our work has indicated that keto-scyllo-inositol is on the catabolic pathway (22, 32). A precedent for such proprietary nutritional roles for an

aminocyclitol has been provided by the recent discovery that an O-methylated derivative of IN is synthesized and preferentially catabolized by a strain of *Rhizobium meliloti* during its association with alfalfa (11). The requisite genes are located on a plasmid in *R. meliloti*, and it was suggested that this opine was used as a nutritional reserve for the specific use of the producing strain (11).

Even more nitrogen can be stored in streptidine-P than in IGC-P or IN, and at high concentrations streptidine has growth-inhibiting properties. Further additions of unusual sugar groups during evolution would convert IGC-P and streptidine-P into more potent modulators and inhibitors of protein biosynthesis, with kinases (25, 27) protecting the producing organisms (4, 25). In this evolutionary scenario, streptomycin would be selected over bluensomycin not only because its precursors store more nitrogen but also because it is a more potent inhibitor of competing organisms than bluensomycin (17), and its second guanidino group is more chemically stable than the O-carbamoyl ester of bluensomycin.
