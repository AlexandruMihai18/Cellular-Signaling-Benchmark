Yang, Shao-Nian, and Per-Olof Berggren. β-Cell Caᵥ channel regulation in physiology and pathophysiology. *Am J Physiol Endocrinol Metab* 288: E16–E28, 2005; doi:10.1152/ajpendo.00042.2004.—The β-cell is equipped with at least six voltage-gated Ca²⁺ (Caᵥ) channel α₁-subunits designated Caᵥ1.2, Caᵥ1.3, Caᵥ2.1, Caᵥ2.2, Caᵥ2.3, and Caᵥ3.1. These principal subunits, together with certain auxiliary subunits, assemble into different types of Caᵥ channels conducting L-, P/Q-, N-, R-, and T-type Ca²⁺ currents, respectively. The β-cell shares customary mechanisms of Caᵥ channel regulation with other excitable cells, such as protein phosphorylation, Ca²⁺-dependent inactivation, and G protein modulation. However, the β-cell displays some characteristic features to bring these mechanisms into play. In islet β-cells, Caᵥ channels can be highly phosphorylated under basal conditions and thus marginally respond to further phosphorylation. In β-cell lines, Caᵥ channels can be surrounded by tonically activated protein phosphatases dominating over protein kinases; thus their activity is dramatically enhanced by inhibition of protein phosphatases. During the last 10 years, we have revealed some novel mechanisms of β-cell Caᵥ channel regulation under physiological and pathophysiological conditions, including the involvement of exocytotic proteins, inositol hexakisphosphate, and type 1 diabetic serum. This minireview highlights characteristic features of customary mechanisms of Caᵥ channel regulation in β-cells and also reviews our studies on newly identified mechanisms of β-cell Caᵥ channel regulation.

THE PATCH CLAMP TECHNIQUE endows electrophysiologists with great possibilities to investigate voltage-gated Ca²⁺ (Caᵥ) channels and their regulation at the molecular level, especially in small cells like the pancreatic β-cell (32). Single Caᵥ channels were discovered in *Helix pomatia* neurons shortly after the development of this powerful technique (61). Subsequently, different groups made successful recordings of both single and whole cell Caᵥ channel currents in the pancreatic β-cells (5). The biophysical properties, subcellular distributions, and functions of Caᵥ channels have been extensively examined by combining the techniques of electrophysiology, molecular biology, and microscopy. Functional Caᵥ channels are Ca²⁺-conducting pores primarily localized in the plasma membrane (15). In response to membrane depolarization, the conformation of Caᵥ channels switches from a closed state to an open state. Ca²⁺ influx through Caᵥ channels serves as the second messenger to couple electrical signaling to chemical signaling (15). It controls a diverse range of intracellular events, including exocytosis, endocytosis, muscle contraction, synaptic transmission, and metabolism (15). It triggers life at fertilization and controls proliferation, differentiation, and development through the regulation of protein phosphorylation, gene expression, and cell cycle (10). It causes cell death through initiation of apoptosis and necrosis (10, 11).

A mission of paramount importance for β-cell Caᵥ channels is to trigger insulin exocytosis. When plasma glucose levels rise, resultant increases in glucose uptake into and metabolism by the pancreatic β-cell lead to an increase in the ATP-to-ADP ratio, inhibiting β-cell ATP-sensitive K⁺ channels and consequently depolarization of the plasma membrane. The membrane depolarization opens β-cell Caᵥ channels to mediate Ca²⁺ influx, thereby stimulating insulin secretion (9). β-Cell Caᵥ channel activity and/or density is regulated by a variety of mechanisms, such as cytoplasmic free Ca²⁺ concentration ([Ca²⁺]i), protein phosphorylation, translocation, interaction with other proteins, and so on. Up- and downregulation of Caᵥ channel activity and/or density result in more or less insulin exocytosis, respectively (1, 4, 41, 47, 51, 75, 79, 113, 116). Another important task of β-cell Caᵥ channels is to regulate β-cell fate by controlling [Ca²⁺]i dynamics (48, 49). Hyperactivation of β-cell Caᵥ channels leads to β-cell death (48, 49). Recently, novel mechanisms of β-cell Caᵥ channel regulation have been revealed under physiological and pathological conditions. In this review, we will briefly summarize current views on the biophysical feature, structure, and function of β-cell

Cav channels. We will then highlight and discuss recent findings concerning molecular mechanisms of β-cell Cav channel regulation.

Electrophysiological recording, pharmacological manipulation, biochemical purification, and molecular cloning have identified diverse Cav currents, Cav channel proteins, and genes. The researchers in these different fields used to employ different terminologies to describe these entities (25). Physiologists depicted Cav currents phenomenologically (such as long lasting and large conductance for L-type Cav currents). Biochemists named Cav channel proteins with Greek letters (α₁-, β-, γ-, and α₂δ-subunits). Molecular biologists described Cav channel mRNAs using the terminology class A, class B, etc. This made the nomenclature of Cav channels confusing. Therefore, a comprehensive nomenclature of Cav channels was proposed in 2000 on the basis of sequence analysis (25). It classifies Cav channels into three families Cav1, Cav2, and Cav3, consisting of closely related members. This nomenclature, known as the structural nomenclature, has been widely accepted to describe Cav channel proteins and mRNAs. However, it is hardly applied to the description of Cav currents recorded from native cells expressing complex mixtures of Cav channel subunits. In this review, the phenomenological nomenclature is used to describe Cav currents, and the structural nomenclature is used to describe Cav channel proteins and mRNAs. To comprehend the literature cited, some old terms are mentioned and followed by the structural nomenclature in brackets.

### PHYSIOLOGICAL TYPES OF CAᵥ CHANNELS

Our understanding of the diversity of Cav channels began with electrophysiological recordings. In 1975, Hagiwara et al. (30) recorded two types of Cav currents with distinct activation and inactivation from fertilized starfish eggs. They made the earliest classification of Cav channels, channel I (low-voltage activated, LVA) and channel II (high-voltage activated, HVA), on the basis of biophysical properties. Six years later, the LVA and HVA Ca²⁺ currents were also found in central neurons (60). Application of the patch clamp technique in combination with selective Cav channel blockers has been crucial in the further classification of Cav channels. The Tsien group has made a number of landmark studies on Cav channel classification using patch clamp analysis in combination with pharmacological manipulation. This group and others (59, 81, 104) identified five or six types of Cav currents, L-, P/Q-, N-, R-, and T-types, and proposed the presence of the corresponding types of Cav channels. The biophysical and pharmacological properties as well as localizations and functions of Cav channels are summarized in Table 1.

T-type Cav channels need a small depolarization to become activated, thus designated LVA Ca²⁺ channels. The name T-type Cav channels was derived from their biophysical properties, i.e., a tiny single-channel conductance and a transient kinetics of inactivation. T-type Cav channels have been identified in neurons, muscles, endocrine cells, and even nonexcitable cells. They are mainly involved in repetitive firing in excitable cells (15, 104).

The L-, P/Q-, N-, and R-type Cav channels are opened by large depolarizations and belong to the HVA Ca²⁺ channel family. Its members can be discriminated according to their biophysical and pharmacological properties. L-type Cav channels are sensitive to dihydropyridines (DHPs), are characterized by a large unitary conductance, and conduct a long-lasting current. Therefore, these channels are named L-type Cav channels. This type of Cav channel is widely distributed in all excitable and some nonexcitable cells. They play important roles in excitation-contraction coupling, hormone secretion, [Ca²⁺]ᵢ homeostasis, and gene regulation (15, 104).

N-type Cav channels display some biophysical properties, such as single-channel conductance and inactivation rate, intermediate between those of the T- and L-type Cav channels. These channels are neither T nor L and are blocked by ω-conotoxin GVIA. Originally they were found only in neurons and play a key role in neurotransmitter release. Accordingly, they are termed N-type Cav channels (15, 104).

P-type Cav channels were first identified in cerebellar Purkinje cells (59). Subsequently, Q-type Cav channels were discovered in cerebellar granule cells (81). Initially, the P- and Q-types were regarded as two distinct types on the basis of differences in their inactivation rate and sensitivity to ω-agatoxin IVA. These two types are now combined as P/Q-type Cav channels because both of them use the same principal subunit, Cav2.1, to conduct currents. The biophysical properties and functions of P/Q-type Cav channels highly overlap with those of N-type Cav channels (15, 104).

E18 β-CELL CAᵥ CHANNEL REGULATION

R-type Caᵥ channels were found in the same experiment where Q-type Caᵥ channels were characterized (81). In cerebellar granule cells, a residual Caᵥ current was shown to be resistant to DHPs and N- and P/Q-type Caᵥ channel toxins. A novel toxin, SNX-482, with high affinity for R-type Caᵥ channels has been purified (71). Fast inactivation is a major biophysical difference between R-type and other HVA Ca²⁺ channels. The R-type Caᵥ channel is a key player in generation of Ca²⁺-dependent action potentials and plays a role in neurotransmitter release (15, 104).

MOLECULAR STRUCTURE OF CAᵥ CHANNEL SUBUNITS

Advanced molecular biology, protein chemistry, and X-ray crystallography enabled us to learn a great deal about Caᵥ channels. The Catterall group (18) made the first solubilization and purification of Caᵥ channel proteins from the transverse tubule membranes of skeletal muscle. Initially, they found that the skeletal muscle Caᵥ channel consists of α₁-, β-, and γ-subunits and later revealed an additional α₂δ-subunit (15). The Numa group (103) subsequently cloned the skeletal muscle α₁S-subunit (Caᵥ1.1) cDNA, which is the first cloned cDNA of Caᵥ channels. Two years later, this group isolated the complete cDNA clone of the α₁C-subunit (Caᵥ1.2) from rabbit cardiac muscle and succeeded in functional expression of Caᵥ1.2 channels in Xenopus oocytes (66). Shortly thereafter, the cDNA of the α₁D-subunit (Caᵥ1.3) was isolated from human pancreatic islets (95). Recently, the cDNA and amino acid sequences of α₁G (Caᵥ3.1) from the insulin-secreting cell line INS-1 have been determined (119). Until now, the primary structures of ten distinct α₁ and numerous auxiliary subunits have been identified by cDNA cloning and sequencing (Fig. 1) (3, 15, 25).

A model of the molecular organization of the Caᵥ channel composed of five subunits has been derived on the basis of analysis of the biochemical properties, glycosylation, and hydrophobicity of these subunits. Basically, this model depicts that a principal transmembrane α₁-subunit associates with a disulfide-linked α₂δ-dimer, an intracellular phosphorylated β-subunit, and a transmembrane γ-subunit (15). Structure-function analysis demonstrates that the α₁-subunit is the principal subunit in the channel protein complex. This subunit is equipped with a transmembrane topology of four homologous

repeats (I to IV), each containing six transmembrane segments (S1 to S6) and a membrane-associated loop between transmembrane segments S5 and S6. This structure endows the $\alpha_{1}$-subunit with a Ca$^{2+}$-conducting pore. The S4 segments serve as the voltage sensors for channel activation. The S5 and S6 segments as well as the membrane-associated loop between them form the pore lining of Cav channels (Fig. 1) (15). Electron microscopy-based image analysis has revealed the three-dimensional structures of Cav1.1 and Cav1.2 channels and proposed the subunit organization of these Cav channels (110, 111). In this year (2004), exciting progress has been made in understanding the Cav channel structure at the atomic level (17, 73, 107). High-resolution crystal structures reveal the following important aspects: 1) the $\beta$-subunit core contains two interacting domains, a Src homology 3 (SH3) domain and a guanylate kinase (GK) domain; 2) the $\alpha$-interaction domain (AID) of $\alpha_{1}$-subunits binds to a hydrophobic cleft ($\alpha$-binding pocket, ABP) but not to the previously proposed $\beta$-interaction domain (BID) of $\beta$-subunits; 3) the $\beta$-subunit may directly modulate the movement of S6 in the $\alpha_{1}$-subunit domain I to influence channel pore gating; 4) the BID preserves the structural integrity of the SH3 and GK domains and links these two domains together; and 5) the multifunctional module-containing $\beta$-subunit can perform a diverse range of tasks (17, 73, 107).

$\beta$-Subunits and other subunits are not directly involved in the formation of the Ca$^{2+}$-conducting pore and thus are called auxiliary subunits. However, they do play important roles in the regulation of surface expression, gating properties, and voltage dependence of Cav channels (3, 15). Four distinct $\beta$-subunits have been identified. The $\beta$-subunit is entirely cytosolic and associates with the $\alpha_{1}$-subunit. Importantly, this subunit is a substrate of protein kinase A. Modulation of Cav channel activity can result from $\beta$-subunit phosphorylation. The $\beta$-subunit has two major functions, i.e., enhancement of plasma membrane trafficking of the $\alpha_{1}$-subunit and regulation of biophysical properties of Cav channels. However, distinct $\beta$-subunits can exhibit opposite effects, especially on inactivation kinetics. For example, coexpression of the $\beta_{2}$-subunit makes inactivation slower. On the contrary, coexpression of the $\beta_{3}$-subunit significantly accelerates inactivation (3, 42). Molecular cloning has revealed four distinct $\alpha_{2}\delta$-subunits

$(\alpha_{2}\delta_{1}-\alpha_{2}\delta_{4})$ (3). The $\alpha_{2}\delta$-subunit comes from the same gene and is a two-peptide dimer linked by disulfide bonds (3). Although $\alpha_{2}$ is entirely extracellular and $\delta$ possesses a single transmembrane region, $\alpha_{2}$ interacts with the $\alpha_{1}$-subunit (3). Distinct $\alpha_{2}\delta$-subunits have slightly different contributions to channel function (3). Basically, coexpression of the $\alpha_{2}\delta$-subunits promotes $\alpha_{1}$-subunit trafficking to the plasma membrane and increases current amplitude. In addition, channel activation and inactivation are also affected by the co-expression of some $\alpha_{2}\delta$-subunits (3). Some of these effects occur in the presence of the $\beta$-subunit, whereas others do not require the co-expression of the $\beta$-subunit (3). The $\gamma$-subunit was originally identified only in skeletal muscle. Recently, several $\gamma$-subunits ($\gamma_{1}-\gamma_{8}$) have been found within a wide variety of tissues (3). All the identified $\gamma$-subunits have no effect on channel trafficking (3); however, they inhibit channel activity and modulate activation and inactivation kinetics (Fig. 1) (3).

$\beta$-Cell Cav channels are heterogeneous. Multiple $\alpha_{1}$-subunit mRNAs and proteins have been revealed in insulin-secreting cells or islets (Table 2). All studies indicate that the Cav1.2, and in particular Cav1.3, subunit mRNAs and proteins are predominant in all tested insulin-secreting cells and islets (36, 46, 86, 93, 95, 116). The $\beta$-cell from any tested species carries Cav1.2 and Cav1.3 subunit mRNAs (Table 2). The Cav1.2 subunit protein has been identified in mouse islet $\beta$-cells as well as in HIT-15T, RINm5F, MIN6, and $\beta$TC-3 cells (Table 2). The Cav1.3 subunit protein has been detected in mouse islet $\beta$-cells and in INS-1 and RINm5F cells (Table 2). More interestingly, expansion of the ATG trinucleotide repeat in the human Cav1.3 gene (CACNL1A2) from seven to eight was found only in type 2 diabetics. Although the frequency of this mutation is low and not associated with the development of common type 2 diabetes, it may be involved in the pathogenesis of a subgroup of this polygenic disease (114, 115). A Japanese family with spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 caused by mutations of the Cav2.1 gene (CACNL1A4) is highly associated with type 2 diabetes (100). For the rest of the $\alpha_{1}$-subunits, there are obvious interspecies differences (Table 2). $\alpha_{1}$-Subunit mRNAs and proteins in islet $\beta$-cells and insulin-secreting cell lines from different species are listed in Table 2. The $\alpha_{2}\delta_{2}$-subunit mRNA has been revealed in the human pancreas (26). The $\beta_{2}$- and $\beta_{3}$-subunit mRNAs have been found in rat

E20 β-CELL CAᵥ CHANNEL REGULATION

pancreatic islets. Competitive RT-PCR shows that the β₂-subunit mRNA level is much higher than the β₃-subunit mRNA level, suggesting that the β₂-subunit is predominant in rat pancreatic islets (45). We have revealed both β₂- and β₃-subunits at the mRNA and protein levels in mouse islets (Berggren P-O, unpublished observations). It is unknown whether the γ-subunit is expressed in the β-cell. Although some β-cell CAᵥ channel mRNA and protein isoforms were identified using fluorescence-activated cell sorting and immunocytochemical approaches, others were manifested in islet tissues. Therefore, caution is needed in interpretation of the results from the islet tissue, as it contains four types of endocrine cells as well as nerve endings and capillaries. Application of optical tweezers, fluorescence-activated cell sorting, and single-cell PCR will provide more detailed information on β-cell CAᵥ channel mRNA and protein isoforms.

β-CELL CAᵥ CHANNELS AND INSULIN SECRETION

Pancreatic β-cells as paraneurons are equipped with neuronal protein assemblies such as a similar set of exocytotic proteins and a rich assortment of CAᵥ channels, including L-, P/Q-, N-, R-, and T-types (Table 2). Patch clamp studies have been extensively performed for the characterization of β-cell CAᵥ channels. Whole cell CAᵥ currents were first reported in the cultured neonatal rat pancreatic β-cell (90). Soon they were identified in a variety of β-cells, including insulin-secreting cell lines and islet β-cells from different species (Table 2) (5). All types of β-cell CAᵥ channels are involved in stimulus-secretion coupling.

Physiological and pharmacological studies have revealed that the L-type CAᵥ channel is expressed in all the islet β-cells and insulin-secreting cell lines from any species tested (Table 2). The β-cell L-type CAᵥ channel has the same biophysical features as the neuronal L-type CAᵥ channel: normally large single-channel conductance, long-lasting kinetics, and high sensitivity to DHPs. There is now consensus that the L-type CAᵥ channel is the major CAᵥ channel type playing a predominant role over other types of CAᵥ channels in Ca²⁺-triggered insulin exocytosis (5, 89, 96). However, the proportion of L-type CAᵥ currents to total CAᵥ currents in the β-cell varies among species. The majority of CAᵥ currents in the mouse islet β-cell flow through the L-type CAᵥ channel. Therefore, the mouse pancreatic β-cell was thought to be equipped with only L-type CAᵥ channels (5). However, later studies revealed the presence of other types of CAᵥ channels as well in the mouse pancreatic β-cell (94). Also in the rat islet β-cell, the L-type CAᵥ channel dominates, although this cell carries more types of CAᵥ channels than the mouse β-cell (Table 2). A smaller number of CAᵥ channel studies have been performed in human β-cells. However, data available clearly demonstrate that L-type CAᵥ channels underlie the principal HVA Ca²⁺ currents of human β-cells (96). Pharmacological experiments demonstrate that 60–80% of glucose-induced insulin secretion from mouse, rat, and human β-cells, equipped with various types of CAᵥ channels, is attributed to Ca²⁺ influx through the L-type CAᵥ channel (19, 72, 94). Hence, although insulin-secreting cell lines use various types of CAᵥ channels to trigger insulin exocytosis, L-type CAᵥ channels still play a major role (89, 91, 96, 105).

There are two subtypes of β-cell L-type CAᵥ channels: CAᵥ1.2 and CAᵥ1.3 channels (69, 94, 113, 116). The distinct contribution of CAᵥ1.2 and CAᵥ1.3 subtypes to insulin exocytosis has not been thoroughly studied in different species and remains controversial. L-type CAᵥ channel subtype-specific regulation of insulin secretion has not been examined in human islet β-cells. In rat β-cells, the level of α₁D-subunit mRNA is 2.5 times higher than that of α₁C-subunit mRNA (46). Recently, β-cell CAᵥ1.2-specific knockout mice have been created. Mouse β-cells lacking CAᵥ1.2 subunit exhibit a decrease in CAᵥ currents by ~45%, an inhibition of first-phase insulin secretion by ~80%, and glucose intolerance (94). L-type CAᵥ channel blockers had no effect on CAᵥ channel currents and insulin release from β-cells lacking CAᵥ1.2 subunits. Furthermore, previous studies showed negative CAᵥ1.3 subunit-like immunoreactivity in mouse pancreatic β-cells (7, 94). Those results led to the conclusion that only CAᵥ1.2 subunits conduct L-type CAᵥ currents in mouse pancreatic β-cells and play a crucial role in stimulus-secretion coupling. However, the presence of CAᵥ1.3 subunit mRNAs and proteins in mouse pancreatic β-cells has been clearly demonstrated by other groups (69, 116). Additionally, CAᵥ1.3 subunit knockout mice displayed the compensatory overexpression of CAᵥ1.2 subunit proteins in β-cells (69). Electrophysiological analysis showed that there was no difference in either total voltage-gated Ba²⁺ current density or L-type current density between mutant and control cells. However, biophysical properties of L-type CAᵥ currents in CAᵥ1.3 subunit-deficient β-cells were significantly altered. The current-voltage relationship of the mutant β-cells was shifted by ~10 mV toward more positive potentials at the lower voltage range. Furthermore, mutant islets secreted less insulin than control islets in the presence of 3 mM glucose. However, insulin secretion from mutant islets was similar to that from control islets when subjected to 6 mM or higher concentrations of glucose. This indicates that overexpression of CAᵥ1.2 subunits indeed compensates for the loss of CAᵥ currents conducted by CAᵥ1.3 subunits and thereby maintains insulin secretion capacity. Hence, β-cell CAᵥ1.3 subunits in wild-type mouse β-cells are likely to play an important role in basal insulin secretion and also stimulus-secretion coupling at the lower range of glucose concentrations (69). The compensatory responses in β-cells may differ between CAᵥ1.2 and CAᵥ1.3 subunit-deficient mice. Apparently, the distinct contribution of CAᵥ1.2 and CAᵥ1.3 subtypes to insulin exocytosis remains to be elucidated.

The selective N-type CAᵥ channel blocker ω-conotoxin GVIA has been used to identify N-type CAᵥ channels in β-cells (Table 2). The mouse islet β-cell does not appear to possess N-type CAᵥ channels, as application of ω-conotoxin GVIA did not affect the mouse β-cell CAᵥ currents (96). Evidence for the presence of N-type CAᵥ channels in the rat islet β-cell was obtained by measuring [Ca²⁺]i (80). This study revealed that arachidonic acid induced Ca²⁺ influx into purified rat pancreatic β-cells (80). The L-type CAᵥ channel blocker nifedipine only partially blocked the effect. Interestingly, ω-conotoxin GVIA, an N-type CAᵥ channel blocker, decreased arachidonic acid-induced Ca²⁺ influx by a magnitude similar to that of nifedipine. This indicates that rat β-cell N-type CAᵥ channels mediate Ca²⁺ influx induced by arachidonic acid (80). Electrophysiological and pharmacological evidence does not support N-type CAᵥ channels being situated in human β-cells (19).

Some groups have detected N-type Cav currents in HIT-15T, RINm5F, and INS-1 cells (89, 91, 96). Contradictory to this, other groups reported that whole cell Cav currents in HIT-15T, RINm5F, and INS-1 cells were insensitive to ω-conotoxin GVIA (64, 89, 96). The role of N-type Cav channels in insulin exocytosis is controversial. The N-type Cav channel blocker ω-conotoxin GVIA indeed gave a measurable inhibition of the second phase of glucose-induced insulin secretion from rat islets but had no effects on the first phase. The effect on the second phase of glucose-induced insulin secretion was attributed to toxic effects of the high concentration of ω-conotoxin GVIA used (53).

β-Cell P/Q-type Cav currents have been recorded in various types of β-cells, including mouse, rat, and human islet β-cells as well as INS-1 and RINm5F cell lines (Table 2). Recently, the presence of P/Q-type Cav channels has been verified in the mouse islet β-cell. A mixture of the L-type Cav blocker isradipine and R-type Cav blocker SNX-482 reduced Cav currents recorded from the mouse islet β-cell by ~80%. A cocktail of isradipine, SNX-482, and ω-agatoxin IVA almost fully blocked mouse β-cell Cav currents (94). The role of P/Q-type Cav channels in stimulus-secretion coupling of mouse β-cells remains to be examined. The involvement of P/Q-type Cav channels in insulin secretion from rat β-cells has been demonstrated by electrophysiological and pharmacological means (58). The P/Q-type Cav channel blocker ω-agatoxin IVA partially blocks HVA Ca²⁺ currents in the rat β-cell and inhibits the DHP-resistant component of glucose-induced insulin secretion by ~30% (58). Previous work showed that a portion of Cav currents and Ca²⁺-dependent insulin secretion in human islet cells remained in the presence of both the L-type Cav channel blocker nifedipine and the N-type Cav channel blocker ω-conotoxin GVIA (19). Recently, ~25% of human β-cell Cav currents have been verified as P/Q-type Cav currents by application of ω-agatoxin IVA. The effect of ω-agatoxin IVA on insulin release from human β-cell is significant, but less than that of the L-type Cav channel blocker (96).

It was difficult to evaluate whether the R-type Cav channel was present in β-cells and involved in Ca²⁺-dependent insulin secretion. These problems were solved by the application of mice lacking the Cav2.3 (α₁E) subunit and selective peptide antagonist of the R-type Cav channel (71, 76). Pharmacological manipulation has dissected R-type Cav currents from whole cell Cav currents in mouse islet β-cells and INS-1 cells (Table 2). The Cav2.3 subunit-selective peptide antagonist SNX-482 inhibits ~60% of isradipine-resistant Cav currents in mouse islet β-cells (94). Evidence indicates that Ca²⁺ influx through R-type Cav channels is coupled to insulin exocytosis (28, 76, 105, 106). Cav2.3-deficient mice exhibited disturbances in glucose tolerance and insulin secretion as well as hyperglycemia (76). An appreciable proportion of the increase in mouse β-cell capacitance, reflecting insulin exocytosis in response to depolarizations, can be blocked by SNX-482. Glucose- and KCl-induced insulin secretion from INS-1 cells was inhibited by SNX-482 in a dose-dependent manner (105).

Although the mouse β-cell does not carry T-type Cav channels, they have been identified in human and rat islet β-cells as well as in RINm5F and INS-1 cells (Table 2). Interestingly, the occurrence of T-type Cav channels has been observed in nonobese diabetic (NOD) mouse β-cells (108). The β-cell T-type Cav channel is likely to be a player in

stimulus-secretion coupling (13, 52, 68). The T-type Cav channel blocker NiCl₂ has been shown to inhibit insulin secretion from INS-1 cells in a dose-dependent manner (13). However, it is not known about the role of the T-type Cav channel in insulin secretion from rat and human islet β-cells. It would be attractive to evaluate the possible contribution of the T-type Cav channel to stimulus-secretion coupling in these islet β-cells.

### β-CELL CAV CHANNELS AND β-CELL DEATH

The β-cell Cav channel also plays an important role in the maintenance of β-cell viability. It coordinates with non-voltage-gated Ca²⁺ channels, Ca²⁺ buffering systems, and Ca²⁺ pumps to effectively control dynamics and homeostasis of [Ca²⁺]i, a life-and-death signal (10, 11, 48, 74). The sophisticated interplay between Cav channels and non-voltage-gated Ca²⁺ channels and Ca²⁺ buffering systems as well as Ca²⁺ pumps in the cell can form an infinity of functional combinations spatially and/or temporally. Some of them play an important role in cell growth, proliferation, and differentiation. Others trigger necrosis and apoptosis. Therefore, it is easy to understand why [Ca²⁺]i can be either a life or a death signal (11). Generally speaking, Ca²⁺ influx through the properly opened Cav channels provides cells with a life signal. On the contrary, hyperactivation of Cav channels may result in too high a [Ca²⁺]i, this divalent cation then serving as a death signal (74). For example, the enhancement of β-cell L-type Cav activity by type 1 diabetic serum causes typical apoptosis (48). Moreover, the long-term L-type Cav channel opening induced by glucose and tolbutamide results in pancreatic β-cell apoptosis (24). Cytokines trigger pancreatic β-cell death through activation of T-type Cav channels (109). The loss of β-cells occurs in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Type 1 diabetes is characterized by the absolute loss of pancreatic β-cells; type 2 diabetes is defined by not only the progressive loss of β-cell function but also increased β-cell apoptosis (62). It is likely that hyperactivation of β-cell Cav channels is involved in the loss of β-cells in both type 1 and 2 diabetes (49).

### CUSTOMARY MECHANISMS OF β-CELL CAV CHANNEL REGULATION

Unlike receptors, there are no endogenous selective activators or inhibitors to control individual types of Cav channels. Physiologically, only the degree of membrane depolarization determines the opening of LVA or HVA Ca²⁺ channels. There must be some other distinct mechanisms to fine tune individual Cav channel functions. The striking structural differences among Ca²⁺-conducting pore subunits lay a foundation for distinct regulations of Cav channels (15).

Phosphorylation, the most prevalent reversible, covalent modification, is a highly effective means of regulating the activities of target proteins. Regulation of L-type Cav channels by protein phosphorylation is an important example. A variety of protein kinases and phosphatases are present in the pancreatic β-cell (Fig. 2) (22, 70, 97). Activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) markedly increases Ca²⁺-dependent insulin secretion from permeabilized rat pancreatic islets (102). However, activation of PKA leads to only a marginal increase in L-type Cav currents in mouse pancreatic β-cells, which

accounts for a minor proportion of the total increase in insulin exocytosis by PKA (1, 2). A positive impact on insulin exocytosis by protein kinase C (PKC) activation has been found in rat pancreatic β-cells (102). Interestingly, regulation of L-type Cav channels by PKC-mediated phosphorylation is quite different. Acute application of a PKC activator does not affect β-cell Cav channel activity (4). However, β-cell Ca²⁺ influx through β-cell Cav channels dramatically decreases after deprivation of PKC (4). This means that PKC plays a tonic role in maintaining a proper function of β-cell Cav channels and stimulus-secretion coupling (4). cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) is present in the pancreatic β-cell (118). The effects of PKG activators 8-bromo-cGMP and dibutyryl-cGMP on β-cell Cav channels have been evaluated by measuring [Ca²⁺]i or patch clamp techniques; however, the results are not consistent. Although [Ca²⁺]i measurements in combination with application of L-type Cav channel blockers indicate that cGMP increased Ca²⁺ influx through L-type Cav channels in rat pancreatic β-cells, direct recordings of Cav channel currents show that cGMP does not alter Cav channel activity in mouse β-cells (43, 118). It should be noted that cGMP analogs can produce a direct effect on Cav channels bypassing PKG (20). Ca²⁺/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaM kinase II) is expressed in pancreatic β-cells and is involved in the regulation of insulin secretion (22). It is well known that binding of Ca²⁺/calmodulin to the L-type Cav channel is responsible for Ca²⁺-dependent inactivation of this channel (98). However, it is unknown whether CaM kinase II per se modulates β-cell Cav channel activity. Tyrosine kinase signaling plays an important role in regulation of β-cell proliferation, survival, and differentiation (112). It is still unclear whether tyrosine kinases affect β-cell Cav channels by phosphorylating them, although Ca²⁺ influx through β-cell Cav channels has been shown to partially contribute to the increase in [Ca²⁺]i produced by stimulation of insulin receptors (84). The marginal or no changes in Cav channel activity following activation of the aforementioned protein kinases in primary β-cells

indicate that there is a striking difference in Cav channel regulation by protein phosphorylation between primary β-cells and other excitable cells, such as neurons and muscles. It is likely that Cav channels in primary β-cells are highly phosphorylated under basal conditions. Therefore, it is difficult to further phosphorylate these channels following stimulation (1, 2, 4).

Several types of protein phosphatases are present in β-cells (2, 29). Inhibition of protein phosphatases has no significant effect on Cav channel activity in mouse pancreatic β-cells but dramatically increases Cav currents in the rat insulin-producing cell line RINm5F, which results in enhancement of insulin secretion from this cell line (2, 29). This indicates that, in some β-cell lines, Cav channels can be surrounded by tonically activated protein phosphatases dominating over protein kinases and thus being sensitive to inhibition of protein phosphatases.

Ca²⁺ not only flows through Cav channels to produce currents but also functions as the feedback regulator of these channels. The Ca²⁺-dependent inactivation of L-type Cav channels is thought to offer an important physiological feedback mechanism protecting against Ca²⁺ overload resulting from activation of these channels during action potentials (98). The Ca²⁺-dependent inactivation of β-cell L-type Cav channels was first described in the mouse pancreatic β-cell, where the majority of voltage-activated Ca²⁺ currents are mediated by L-type Cav channels (79). Later on, this phenomenon was also found in β-cells from other species (52). Ca²⁺-dependent inactivation of β-cell L-type Cav channels results in a Ca²⁺ current decay during depolarization. The most marked decay of β-cell Cav currents occurs at the potential evoking the largest current. The β-cell Cav current decay disappears when the charge carrier Ca²⁺ is replaced with Ba²⁺. Originally, the binding of Ca²⁺ or some mediators activated by Ca²⁺ to the Cav channel was proposed to be responsible for the Ca²⁺-dependent inactivation (52, 79). Now the COOH-terminal IQ domain of the Cav1.2 subunit has been demonstrated to bind Ca²⁺-activated calmodulin. This binding initiates Cav con-

formational changes, which cause Ca²⁺-dependent inactivation (98).

Inhibitory coupling between G proteins and Cav channels is one of the classical pathways of Cav channel regulation. This regulation is voltage dependent and membrane delimited. N-type and P/Q-type Cav channels in particular are modulated by direct interaction with G proteins. Cav channel regulation by the direct membrane-delimited interaction with G protein is characterized by a positive shift in the voltage dependence and a slowing of channel activation (21). The Ga-subunit was thought to be responsible for this action on the channel (21, 35). However, later the Gβγ-subunits were demonstrated to play the key role in regulation of Cav channels (21). It is clear that Gβγ-subunits bind to the I-II linker of N-type and P/Q-type Cav channels. The binding site in the I-II linker has been mapped. The QQIER sequence is essential for Gβγ binding (21). Additionally, NH₂ and COOH termini of the Cav α₁-subunit are also involved in Gβγ-binding (21). It has been suggested that activation of G protein-coupled receptors significantly inhibits insulin secretion via inhibition of β-cell Cav channel activity (27, 39, 40, 50). Indeed, P/Q-type Cav channels are present in pancreatic β-cells (19, 36, 58, 63, 99). However, the L-type Cav channel in insulin-secreting cell lines is the major mediator of the inhibition of insulin secretion by the activation of G protein-coupled receptors, including α₂-adrenergic, galanin, and somatostatin receptors (27, 39, 40, 50). Conversely, the stimulation of these G protein-coupled receptors in mouse islet β-cells does not influence voltage-activated Ca²⁺ influx (82). Moreover, the low conductance G protein-dependent K⁺ channel is drastically activated by the stimulation of the mouse β-cell α₂-adrenergic receptors (85). Indeed, emerging evidence indicates that Cav1.2 channels are negatively regulated by a direct membrane-delimited interaction with G proteins. A recent study shows that the Gβγ-subunits directly bind to cytosolic NH₂ and COOH termini of the Cav1.2 subunit and significantly inhibit L-type Cav channel activity. It should be noted that in vitro binding assays and coexpression in Xenopus oocytes were employed in this study (44). Interestingly, it has been demonstrated that the activation of μ-opioid receptors dramatically increases Cav1.3 channel activity (93). Collectively, the molecular mechanisms whereby the activation of G protein-coupled receptors regulate L-type Cav channel activity and insulin secretion remain to be established.

whereby the β-cell Cav channel can be regulated. Experimental evidence has demonstrated that the L-type Cav channel has a similar association with the exocytotic machinery as the neuronal N- and P/Q-type Cav channel (47, 51, 113, 116).

Deconvolution analysis of fluorescence images revealed that the expressed Cav1.3 subunit-enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) and enhanced blue fluorescent protein-syntaxin 1 colocalized in the β-cell plasma membrane (116). Furthermore, subcellular fractionation showed that the endogenous Cav1.3 subunit and syntaxin 1A also colocalized in the β-cell plasma membrane. This led to the hypothesis that syntaxin 1A might interact with the Cav1.3 subunit in the pancreatic β-cell, and this was subsequently found to be the case (116). Interestingly, the polyclonal antibody against the intracellular domain of syntaxin 1A efficiently coimmunoprecipitated the Cav1.3 subunit from the β-cell plasma membrane fractions. These results strongly suggest that syntaxin 1A forms a complex with the Cav1.3 subunit of the L-type Cav channel. The physical association of the Cav1.3 subunit with syntaxin 1A exhibits clear functional consequences. On the one hand, β-cell L-type Cav channel activity drastically runs down following anti-syntaxin 1A antibody interference with the formation of a syntaxin 1A-Cav1.3 subunit complex. On the other hand, the dissociation of syntaxin 1A from the Cav1.3 subunit dramatically perturbs insulin exocytosis independently of the rundown of L-type Cav channel activity. This indicates that the syntaxin 1A-Cav1.3 subunit complex plays an important role in maintaining both L-type Cav channel activity and syntaxin 1A function (116).

The β-cell Cav1.2 channel is also modulated by exocytotic proteins (113). Pull-down experiments with His₆-fused Cav1.2 subunit peptides show that syntaxin 1A, synaptosome-associated protein of 25 kDa (SNAP-25), and synaptotagmin physically associate with the Cav1.2 channel at the II-III loop of the Cav1.2 subunit (L<sub>C753–893</sub>) (113). The coexpressed syntaxin 1A slightly alters the inactivation and activation rate and significantly decreases the amplitude of Cav1.2 currents recorded in Xenopus oocytes injected with Cav1.2/β<sub>2A</sub>/α₂δ. The inhibitory effects are partially reversed by the coexpression of synaptotagmin. The interruption of the physical association of the Cav1.2 channel with exocytotic proteins by the intracellular application of Cav1.2<sub>753–893</sub> peptide almost completely blocks depolarization-evoked exocytosis without significant influence on Ca²⁺ influx (113). Similar effects were observed in insulin-secreting cell lines overexpressing syntaxin 1A and 3. Overexpression of syntaxin 1A and 3 dramatically inhibits L-type Cav channel activity and Ca²⁺-dependent insulin secretion in insulin-secreting cell lines (51).

Modulation of L-type Cav channel activity by distinct domains within SNAP-25 has been characterized in β-cells (47). L-type Cav currents in mouse β-cells are significantly decreased by intracellular application of SNAP-25<sub>(1–206)</sub>. The coapplication of Cav1.2<sub>753–893</sub> peptide occludes the reduction in L-type Cav currents. HIT cells overexpressing or injected with wild-type SNAP-25 show smaller L-type Cav currents than control cells. This inhibition is also prevented by the Cav1.2<sub>753–893</sub> peptide. Interestingly, expression of SNAP-25<sub>(1–197)</sub> increases L-type Cav currents, and these effects are blocked by the Cav1.2<sub>753–893</sub> peptide. In contrast, intracellular application of SNAP-25<sub>(198–206)</sub> into untransfected cells significantly reduces L-type Cav currents, these inhibitory effects

REGULATION OF β-CELL L-TYPE CAᵥ CHANNELS BY EXOCYTOTIC PROTEINS

In the early 1990s, antibodies against syntaxin or synaptotagmin were reported to coimmunoprecipitate ω-conotoxin-binding proteins (8, 57). This was indicative of possible regulation of Cav channels by exocytotic proteins. Considerable efforts have been made to investigate the physical association and functional interaction of Cav channels with exocytotic proteins. The molecular mechanisms of the regulation of N- and P/Q-type Cav channels by exocytotic proteins have been manifested by combining the techniques of electrophysiology, protein chemistry, and molecular biology (12, 15). Although these mechanisms are not involved in the regulation of neural L-type Cav channels, they do exert direct control of β-cell L-type Cav channels and represent an additional mechanism

dominating over the stimulatory effects of SNAP-25(1–197) overexpression. The results clearly reveal that the soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) protein SNAP-25 possesses distinct inhibitory and stimulatory domains that act on the L-type Caᵥ channel (47). Collectively, the β-cell L-type Caᵥ channel physically associates with the exocytotic machinery. This physical association may not only serve as a fine-tuning mechanism of β-cell L-type Caᵥ channel function but also as an anchoring machinery to optimally organize this channel at the site of insulin exocytosis (Fig. 3).

REGULATION OF β-CELL L-TYPE CAᵥ CHANNELS BY INOSITOL HEXAKISPHOSPHATE

The possibility that inositol hexakisphosphate (InsP₆) acts as a general intracellular signaling molecule in native excitable cells is suggested from a number of findings (23, 55, 87, 88). InsP₆ levels transiently change in several cell types in response to stimulation (55, 88, 117). Microinjection of InsP₆ into neurons of *Aplysia* induces an initial inward current carried mainly by Na⁺ and Ca²⁺ followed by an outward K⁺ current (92). InsP₆ has been shown to enhance insulin exocytosis from permeabilized HIT-T15 cells and mouse islet β-cells through activation of PKC-ε (23, 37). Interestingly, InsP₆ also potentiates dynamin I-mediated β-cell endocytosis by means of calcineurin-induced dephosphorylation (38).

The aforementioned results attracted us to examine the possible role of InsP₆ in the regulation of β-cell Caᵥ channels. As we have learned more recently, InsP₆ significantly inhibits the activity of purified catalytic subunits of serine/threonine protein phosphatase types 1, 2A, and 3 as well as corresponding holoenzymes in insulin-secreting cell extracts (55). In addition to the plasma membrane receptor-mediated pathway, glucose stimulation also results in a rapid InsP₆ rise in insulin-secreting cells (55). Furthermore, intracellular application of InsP₆ dramatically potentiates L-type Caᵥ channel activity in insulin-secreting cell lines (55). These results lead to the conclusion that, under physiological conditions, β-cell L-type Caᵥ channels are activated not only by glucose metabolism-mediated depolarization but also by glucose-induced elevation of intracellular InsP₆, which inhibits protein phosphatases and as well activates other mechanisms (see below) leading to an increase in β-cell L-type Caᵥ channel activity (Fig. 3) (55).

The above-mentioned study raises two questions. 1) Does InsP₆ selectively modulate L-type Caᵥ channels? 2) Are there other mechanisms involved in the modulation of L-type Caᵥ channels by InsP₆? To tackle these questions, we chose hippocampal neurons because they are equipped with all known physiological types of Caᵥ channels, including L-, P/Q-, N-, R-, and T-types, and should also contain other possible InsP₆-mediated signaling pathways (14, 33, 34, 101). We observed that intracellular application of InsP₆ selectively enhances L-type Caᵥ currents, although multiple types of Caᵥ channels exist in the hippocampal neuron. Interestingly, we found that InsP₆ significantly increases adenylyl cyclase (AC) activity in hippocampal membrane preparations without influencing cAMP phosphodiesterase (PDE). Physiological consequences of the InsP₆ effect on AC were examined in both biochemical and electrophysiological experiments. In the presence of InsP₆, more cAMP is produced by AC in the hippocampal membrane preparation, resulting in a more effective activation of PKA in the hippocampal cytosol, compared with in the absence of InsP₆. Furthermore, the effect of 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-cAMP, a membrane-permeable cAMP analog, on L-type Caᵥ channel activity is counteracted by pretreatment with InsP₆ (117).

The combination of our findings in β-cells and in hippocampal neurons leads to the novel view that InsP₆ acts as a general intracellular signaling molecule to fine tune L-type Caᵥ channel activity via both inhibition of protein phosphatases and stimulation of the AC-PKA cascade in native excitable cells (Fig. 3).

REGULATION OF β-CELL L-TYPE CAᵥ CHANNELS BY TYPE 1 DIABETIC SERUM

Under certain pathophysiological conditions, an increased Ca²⁺ influx through the hyperactivated Caᵥ channels can overload cells with Ca²⁺. The Ca²⁺ overload results in both the disintegration of cells (necrosis), through the activity of Ca²⁺-sensitive proteases, and the activation of the apoptotic cell death program (10, 11, 74). It is clear that a lethal Ca²⁺ influx occurs in pancreatic β-cells when L-type Caᵥ channels are hyperactivated by exposure to type 1 diabetic serum (Fig. 3) (48). Our initial study revealed that β-cells exposed to type 1 diabetic serum show an increase in L-type Ca²⁺ currents at both the whole cell and single channel levels. Indeed, an abnormal Ca²⁺ entry via L-type Caᵥ channels causes a Ca²⁺ overload in β-cells exposed to type 1 diabetic serum, as manifested by measurements of [Ca²⁺]i. The Ca²⁺ overload, in turn, leads to β-cell apoptosis. The apoptotic effect of type 1 diabetic serum is blocked by L-type Caᵥ channel blockers (48).

Although we are still far from understanding the mechanisms whereby type 1 diabetic serum enhances β-cell Caᵥ channel activity and causes β-cell apoptosis, evidence indicates that multiple factors are involved. Fas-specific antibodies in type 1 diabetic serum elevate [Ca²⁺]i in neuroblastoma cells and cause their apoptosis (78). The rat dorsal root ganglion neurons incubated with the serum from the Bio Bred/Worcester diabetic rat (type 1 diabetic model) display enhancement of both HVA and LVA Ca²⁺ channel activity, associated with

impaired regulation of the inhibitory G protein-Cav channel complex (31, 83). Recently, our group (16) found that incubation with type 1 diabetic serum promotes T-type Cav channel expression in a particular type of neurons with triangular soma in cerebellar granule cell cultures. More recently, we (49) demonstrated that type 1 diabetic serum contains significantly elevated concentrations of apolipoprotein C-III. This serum factor increases L-type Cav channel activity, thereby overloading β-cells with Ca²⁺, resulting in Ca²⁺-dependent β-cell apoptosis. Anti-apolipoprotein C-III antibody effectively abolishes both type 1 diabetic serum- and apolipoprotein C-III-induced increases in [Ca²⁺]i and apoptosis. It is thus possible to postulate that the elevated concentration of apolipoprotein C-III in the blood of type 1 diabetic patients likely aggravates the disease development on top of the autoimmune attack. The mechanisms of β-cell destruction in type 1 diabetes are not fully understood, although T-lymphocyte-mediated β-cell death has been considered as a major one (65). Apparently, the effect of type 1 diabetic serum on β-cells involves both multiple factors in the serum and numerous targets on the β-cells. At the moment, we are searching for additional factors in type 1 diabetic serum, which hyperactivate β-cell Cav channels, and additional targets on β-cells, which mediate β-cell apoptosis.

### CONCLUSIONS

Heterogeneous Cav channels have been identified in the insulin-secreting β-cell (Table 2). The L-type Cav channel plays a predominant role over other types of Cav channels in [Ca²⁺]-triggered insulin exocytosis (5, 89, 96). Besides membrane potential, a variety of signaling pathways, such as protein phosphorylation, Ca²⁺-dependent inactivation, and G protein interaction modulate β-cell Cav channel activity (1, 2, 4, 27, 29, 39, 40, 50, 52, 55, 79, 93). It must be kept in mind, however, that there are some characteristic features of β-cell Cav channel regulation. For example, activation of PKA induces a marked increase in Cav channel activity in hippocampal neurons, but just a marginal change in that of primary β-cells (1, 2, 117). This suggests that the phosphorylation state of Cav channels in primary β-cells may reach extremely high levels under basal conditions. It will be of interest to explore molecular bases for the characteristic features of β-cell Cav channel regulation. In addition to the aforementioned customary mechanisms, we have also characterized some novel mechanisms of β-cell Cav channel regulation. We have revealed that exocytotic proteins and InsP₆ are important players in β-cell Cav channel modulation under physiological conditions and that type 1 diabetic serum hyperactivates β-cell Cav channels and in turn initiates β-cell apoptosis under pathophysiological conditions (16, 47, 48, 55, 116, 117). These findings are summarized in Fig. 3.

Our future goals include defining distinct roles of different types of β-cell Cav channels, identifying β-cell L-type Cav channel-exocytotic protein interaction sites, and exploiting other molecular mechanisms involved in InsP₆ regulation of β-cell Cav channels. Our future goals also comprise determining possible roles of human β-cell Cav channel gene mutations in the development of diabetes and probing the exact factors in type 1 diabetic serum responsible for hyperactivation of β-cell

Cav channels as well as defining underlying molecular mechanisms.
