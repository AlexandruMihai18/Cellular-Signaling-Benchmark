Macrophages in atherosclerosis:  
a dynamic balance  

**Kathryn J. Moore, Frederick J. Sheedy and Edward A. Fisher**

Abstract | Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease that arises from an imbalance in lipid metabolism and a maladaptive immune response driven by the accumulation of cholesterol-laden macrophages in the artery wall. Through the analysis of the progression and regression of atherosclerosis in animal models, there is a growing understanding that the balance of macrophages in the plaque is dynamic and that both macrophage numbers and the inflammatory phenotype influence plaque fate. In this Review, we summarize recently identified pro- and anti-inflammatory pathways that link lipid and inflammation biology with the retention of macrophages in plaques, as well as factors that have the potential to promote their egress from these sites.

Foam cells  
Macrophages in the arterial wall that ingest oxidized low-density lipoprotein and assume a foamy appearance. These cells secrete various substances that are involved in plaque growth.

Myocardial infarction  
An episode of acute cardiac ischaemia that leads to death of heart muscle cells. It is usually caused by a thrombotic atherosclerotic plaque.

Atherosclerosis results from a maladaptive inflammatory response that is initiated by the intramural retention of cholesterol-rich, apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins in susceptible areas of the arterial vasculature¹. Lipoproteins that are sequestered in the arterial wall are susceptible to various modifications (such as oxidation, enzymatic and non-enzymatic cleavage, and aggregation), which render these particles pro-inflammatory and which induce the activation of the overlying endothelium. The ensuing immune response is mediated by the recruitment of monocyte-derived cells into the subendothelial space, where these cells differentiate into mononuclear phagocytes that ingest the accumulated normal and modified lipoproteins, which transforms them into the cholesterol-laden foam cells. Foam cells, typically classified as a type of macrophage, persist in plaques, which promotes disease progression. Although macrophage clearance of lipoproteins is likely to be beneficial at the outset of this immune response, there is little negative feedback following uptake and thus these cells become grossly engorged with lipids. The resulting dysregulation of lipid metabolism alters the macrophage phenotype and compromises crucial immune functions.

Notably, macrophages that accumulate in atherosclerotic plaques seem to have a diminished capacity to migrate, which contributes to their failure to resolve inflammation and to the progression of these lesions to more advanced, complex plaques in which other immune cell subsets and vascular smooth muscle cells participate in the inflammatory process². In these advanced plaques, macrophages continue to be major contributors to the inflammatory response through their secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators (including chemokines, cytokines and reactive oxygen and nitrogen species) and matrix-degrading proteases, and through their eventual death by necrosis or apoptosis. Dying macrophages release their lipid contents and tissue factors, which leads to the formation of a pro-thrombotic necrotic core. This necrotic core is a key component of unstable plaques and contributes to their rupture and the ensuing intravascular blood clot that underlies myocardial infarction and stroke.

Although many cell types, including endothelial cells, monocytes, dendritic cells (DCs), lymphocytes, eosinophils, mast cells and smooth muscle cells, contribute to the formation of atherosclerotic plaques, foam cells are so central to the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis that emphasis has long been placed on understanding the mechanisms of monocyte recruitment into plaques and on identifying strategies to reduce monocyte influx to retard plaque progression. However, it has become apparent that the recruitment of monocytes and other leukocytes into the artery may also be crucial to promote atherosclerosis regression³ and inflammation resolution³. In addition, studies in some models of atherosclerosis regression have shown that macrophage retention can be reversed⁴⁻⁶, which led to the identification of pathways that promote macrophage accumulation in, or egress from, the inflamed plaque. These advances have shown that both the quantity and the phenotype of macrophages influence the inflammatory state of the plaque, and have potentially identified new targets for plaque intervention. In this Review, we discuss the key roles of

**Circulating monocytes and their recruitment**

*Hypercholesterolaemia and monocytosis.* Hypercholesterolaemia is associated with increased numbers of circulating monocytes in mice, pigs and rabbits<sup>7,8</sup>. In apolipoprotein E-deficient (*Apoε<sup>-/-</sup>*) mice, the numbers of circulating monocytes are ~50% higher than in wild-type mice<sup>9,10</sup>. How does hypercholesterolaemia cause monocytosis? Studies using mice have shown that cholesterol enrichment of haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs; precursors of monocytes and neutrophils) increases their expression of the common β-subunit of the interleukin-3 (IL-3) and the granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) receptor and thus, HSPC proliferation<sup>11</sup>. Notably, the expression of factors that promote cholesterol efflux (high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and APOE) in hypercholesterolemic mouse models corrected HSPC proliferation.

Circulating monocytes in mice consist of two major subsets, LY6C<sup>hi</sup> and LY6C<sup>low</sup> monocytes (BOX 1). Interestingly, the monocytosis in hypercholesterolemic mice primarily derives from an increase in the more inflammatory LY6C<sup>hi</sup> subset, which constitutes the majority of cells recruited to progressing atherosclerotic plaques and which is thought to be the source of the M1 macrophages (also known as classically activated macrophages) that are found in the plaques<sup>9–11</sup>. The basis for this cell bias has been postulated to be due to a hypercholesterolaemia-induced impairment of a process in which LY6C<sup>hi</sup> cells are converted to LY6C<sup>low</sup> cells<sup>9</sup>; however, this remains an area of active investigation.

**Recruitment of monocytes into athero-prone arterial sites.** The early steps of atherogenesis have been the subject of numerous reviews (for example, REFS 12–14) and will only be briefly covered here. Atherosclerotic plaques are not randomly distributed, but tend to form at the inner curvatures and branch points of arteries, where laminar flow is either disturbed or insufficient to maintain the normal, quiescent state of the endothelium.

Figure 1 | Mechanisms regulating monocyte recruitment and accumulation in plaques. Hyperlipidaemia increases the number of GR1+LY6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes, which constitute 80% of the monocytes recruited to mouse atherosclerotic plaques, with the remainder being the GR1−LY6C<sup>low</sup> patrolling monocytes. These monocyte subsets use different chemokine–chemokine receptor pairs to infiltrate the intima, which is facilitated by endothelial adhesion molecules, including selectins, intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1) and vascular adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM1). The recruited monocytes differentiate into macrophages or dendritic cells (DCs) in the intima, where they interact with atherogenic lipoproteins. Macrophages avidly take up native and modified (for example, oxidized) low-density lipoprotein (LDL) via macropinocytosis or scavenger receptor-mediated pathways (including via scavenger receptor A1 (SR-A1) and CD36), which results in the formation of the foam cells that are a hallmark of the atherosclerotic plaque. These foam cells secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines (including interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-6, and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)) and chemokines (such as CC-chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2), CCL5 and CXC-chemokine ligand 1 (CXCL1)), as well as macrophage retention factors (such as netrin 1 and semaphorin 3E) that amplify the inflammatory response.

Leukocyte adhesion cascade  
The key steps that are involved in leukocyte adhesion to the endothelium. These include rolling (which is mediated by selectins), activation (which is mediated by chemokines) and arrest (which is mediated by integrins). Recent additional steps have been defined that include capture (also known as tethering), slow rolling, adhesion strengthening and spreading, intravascular crawling, and paracellular and transcellular transmigration.

Firm adhesion  
The interactions of rolling leukocytes with chemokines or lipid mediators, such as leukotriene B4, at the endothelial surface leads to the activation of leukocyte integrins — another family of adhesion molecules. After they are activated, integrins mediate the high-affinity adhesive interactions between leukocytes and endothelial cells, which results in the arrest and firm adhesion of rolling leukocytes.

This activation of the endothelium leads to increased permeability to lipoproteins and an accumulation of extracellular matrix proteins that cause a poorly understood diffuse intimal thickening and the retention of the atherogenic APOB lipoproteins. The arterial intima at these athero-prone sites contains an increased number of myeloid cells that have features of DCs<sup>15</sup>.

The activation of the endothelium also promotes the recruitment of circulating monocytes (FIG. 1). In addition to the bone marrow origin of these monocytes, it has recently been recognized that splenic HSPCs can be an extramedullary myelo-poietic source of monocytes, which are mobilized to inflammatory sites, including to atherosclerotic plaques<sup>16</sup>. The steps that regulate monocyte entry into the arterial intima are apparently independent of the source of the cells and depend on the upregulation on activated endothelial cells of molecules that mediate the arrest of circulating monocytes by the leukocyte adhesion cascade<sup>17</sup>. The capture and rolling phases of this cascade depend on the immobilization of chemokines, particularly CC-chemokine ligand 5 (CCL5) and CXC-chemokine ligand 1 (CXCL1), on endothelial cell glycosaminoglycans, and on P-selectin, which is expressed on the luminal side of endothelial cells. Very recent results have shown that the arrest of LY6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes through CCL5 depends not only on its interaction with CC-chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) but also on its interaction with CCR1 (REF. 18). Vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM1) and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1), which bind to the integrins very late antigen 4 (VLA4; also known as α4β1 integrin) and lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 (LFA1; also known as αLβ2 integrin), respectively, are important for the firm adhesion of monocytes to the luminal surface of the endothelium. Comparatively more LFA1 is expressed by LY6C<sup>low</sup> cells than by LY6C<sup>hi</sup> cells, which may underlie the greater tendency of LY6C<sup>low</sup> cells to adhere to, but not to enter, the vasculature<sup>19</sup>.

REVIEWs

The transmigration of monocytes across the endothelium into plaques is mediated by chemokines that are secreted by endothelial cells, intimal macrophages and smooth muscle cells. Although several chemokines have been implicated in atherosclerosis²⁰, the three major chemokine receptor–chemokine pairs that are thought to be involved in monocyte transmigration are CCR2–CCL2, CX₃C-chemokine receptor 1 (CX₃CR1)–CX₃C-chemokine ligand 1 (CX₃CL1) and CCR5–CCL5 (REF. 10). Indeed, the elimination of these three chemokine axes led to a ~90% reduction in atherosclerosis in Apoe⁻/⁻ mice²¹. In addition to these chemokines, CD31 (also known as PECAM1; an endothelial cell surface immunoglobulin-like adhesion molecule) and VCAM1 may also have a role in monocyte transmigration into atherosclerotic plaques. It should also be noted that CCR2 and CX₃CR1, in addition to their effects on transmigration, indirectly influence the number of monocytes that enter the plaques: in particular, CCR2 is required for the extravasation of LY6Chi cells from the bone marrow and CX₃CR1 promotes their survival by inhibiting apoptosis²²,²³.

In addition to the factors described above, emerging evidence suggests that neuronal guidance cues are involved in monocyte recruitment in atherosclerosis. We recently reported that members of the netrin, semaphorin and ephrin families are expressed by arterial endothelial cells and that they are differentially regulated under conditions that promote or protect from atherosclerosis²⁴; for example, the expression of ephrin B2 is upregulated under pro-atherosclerotic conditions and is a chemoattractant, which increases leukocyte recruitment to athero-prone arterial sites in the absence of additional chemokines²⁴. By contrast, the expression of netrin 1 and semaphorin 3A, which inhibit the chemokine-directed migration of human and murine monocytes *in vitro*, are decreased in athero-prone regions, and the inhibition of these molecules by blocking peptides in wild-type mice increased leukocyte adhesion to the endothelium²⁴. Although further studies in hyperlipidemic mouse models are needed, the data suggest that the coordinated regulation of positive and negative guidance cues facilitates leukocyte infiltration of the endothelium. Notably, these neuronal guidance cues have additional roles in atherosclerosis as they regulate the chemostasis of plaque macrophages²⁵,²⁶ (see below).

Therefore, overall, the recruitment of circulating monocytes into plaques requires the integration of at least three discrete processes, namely, their capture, rolling and transmigration, and each step is regulated by multiple, and sometimes overlapping, molecular factors. The fates of these recruited monocytes in the plaques are addressed in the sections below.

**Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs)**. Host receptors (such as Toll-like receptors) that can sense pathogen-associated or damage-associated molecular patterns and that can initiate signalling cascades (which involve activation of nuclear factor-κB) that lead to an innate immune response.

### Foam cell formation in atherosclerosis

#### Lipoprotein uptake. Lipoprotein uptake by monocyte-derived macrophages is thought to be one of the earliest pathogenic events in the nascent plaque and results in the development of foam cells (FIG. 2). The mechanisms of foam cell formation have been intensely studied (reviewed in REF. 27). Although macrophages can clear APOB-containing lipoproteins through the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor, the expression of this receptor is downregulated early during foam cell formation by the increased cellular cholesterol levels. These observations led to the early hypothesis that lipoproteins must become modified in the artery wall and that they must be taken up by other mechanisms. Multiple means of LDL modification have now been identified that facilitate cholesterol loading of macrophages *in vitro* (FIG. 2); however, the physiologically relevant pathways of foam cell formation *in vivo* remain an area of debate.

A prevailing paradigm has been that increased oxidative stress in the artery wall promotes modifications of LDL, which generates ‘damage’ signals that are recognized by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) on cells of the innate immune system. This hypothesis is supported by the presence of oxidized LDL in both human and mouse atheromas, and of natural antibodies (predominantly IgM) that recognize oxidation-specific epitopes of LDL²⁸. A variety of mechanisms mediated by enzymes (such as 12/15-lipoxygenase and myeloperoxidase) and by free radicals (such as superoxide, hydrogen peroxide and nitric oxide) have been identified that could promote LDL oxidation in the artery wall²⁸, and *in vitro* preparations of such modified LDLs are avidly endocytosed by macrophages²⁹,³⁰.

Scavenger receptors, which are a type of PRR expressed by macrophages, have an important role in atherosclerosis and were originally characterized by their ability to recognize and process modified LDL²⁷. Numerous scavenger receptor family members — including scavenger receptor A1 (SR-A1; encoded by MSR1), macrophage receptor with collagenous structure (MARCO; also known as SR-A2), CD36 (also known as platelet glycoprotein 4), scavenger receptor B1 (SR-B1), lectin-like oxidized LDL receptor 1 (LOX1), scavenger receptor expressed by endothelial cells 1 (SREC1) and scavenger receptor for phosphatidylserine and oxidized LDL (SR-PSOX; also known as CXCL16) — can bind to oxidized LDL and can promote foam cell formation³¹. SR-A1 and CD36 mediate 75–90% of the degradation of LDL that has been modified by acetylation or oxidation by macrophages *in vitro*²⁹. These receptors internalize the lipoproteins and, in the late endolysosomal compartment, the cholesteryl esters of the lipoproteins are hydrolysed to free cholesterol and fatty acids. Free cholesterol in the endolysosomal compartment is then trafficked to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where it undergoes re-esterification by acetyl-coenzyme A:cholesterol acetyltransferase 1 (ACAT1) to cholesterol fatty acid esters that provide the ‘foam’ of the foam cells³².

Combined deficiency of SR-A1 and CD36 reduced foam cell formation in Apoe⁻/⁻ mice; however, this effect was incomplete, which suggests that there are additional mechanisms of macrophage cholesterol uptake *in vivo*³³,³⁴. Despite this redundancy in cholesterol uptake mechanisms, plaques in mice that are deficient in both CD36 and APOE (*Cd36⁻/⁻Apoe⁻/⁻* mice) and in mice that are deficient in SR-A1, CD36 and APOE

Figure 2 | Mechanisms controlling macrophage lipoprotein uptake and efflux. Macrophages internalize native low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) as well as oxidized lipoproteins in the plaque via macropinocytosis, phagocytosis of aggregated LDL and scavenger receptor-mediated uptake (including by scavenger receptor A1 (SR-A1), lectin-like oxidized LDL receptor 1 (LOX1), SR-B1 and CD36). The internalized lipoproteins and their associated lipids are digested in the lysosome, which results in the release of free cholesterol that can travel to the plasma membrane and be effluxed from the cell or to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. In the ER, it can then be esterified by acetyl-coenzyme A:cholesterol acyltransferase 1 (ACAT1) and is ultimately stored in this form in cytosolic lipid droplets. These stored lipids can be mobilized for efflux either via lipolysis by neutral cholesterol ester hydrolase 1 (NCEH1) or via lipophagy, which is a form of autophagy, resulting in the delivery of lipid droplets to lysosomes. The accumulation of cellular cholesterol activates the liver X receptor (LXR)–retinoid X receptor (RXR) heterodimeric transcription factor that upregulates expression of the ATP-binding cassette subfamily A member 1 (ABCA1) and ABCG1. This mediates the transfer of free cholesterol to lipid-poor apolipoprotein A1 (APOA1) to form nascent high-density lipoprotein (HDL) or more lipitated HDL particles in which free cholesterol has been esterified and stored in the core of the particle (known as mature HDL). Excessive free cholesterol accumulation can induce cholesterol crystal formation in the lysosome to activate the NLRP3 (NOD-, LRR- and pyrin domain-containing 3) inflammasome, and may also interfere with the function of the ER (inducing ER stress), which, if prolonged, results in cell death by apoptosis. In addition, lipid rafts are enriched in sphingomyelin, which forms a complex with the free cholesterol. As the cholesterol content of lipid rafts increases, pro-inflammatory Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signalling is promoted, which can also be induced by oxidized LDL, through a heterotrimeric complex composed of CD36–TLR4–TLR6. This signalling results in the activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines.

(Msr⁻/⁻Cd36⁻/⁻Apoε⁻/⁻ mice) have reduced signs of inflammation, macrophage apoptosis and secondary necrosis, which suggests that these scavenger receptors have roles beyond lipid uptake³³,³⁴. Nevertheless, the in vivo relevance of oxidative processes in atherosclerosis remains speculative. Several well-powered human clinical trials of antioxidant vitamins, such as vitamin E and vitamin C, have failed to show a reduction of cardiovascular events³⁵, which encourages the field to consider alternative mechanisms for foam cell formation.

Modification by various proteases and lipases that are present in the intima can also mediate LDL modifications, particularly the aggregation of LDL. The extracellular matrix glycoproteins contribute to this process by retaining the lipoproteins and by modulating the activity of various enzymes, including group IIA secretory phospholipase A2 (PLA2G2A), PLA2G5 and PLA2G10, as well as secretory sphingomyelin²⁷. These lipolytic enzymes produce modified forms of LDL that are taken up via pathways that are independent of

scavenger receptors<sup>36</sup>. Evidence from mouse models supports a role for PLA2 family members in atherosclerosis progression<sup>37</sup>, and circulating PLA2 levels in humans correlate with coronary artery disease risk<sup>38,39</sup>, which identifies it as a promising therapeutic target, although further validation is required.

Finally, although a role for native LDL in foam cell formation was initially discounted, recent studies have shown that, in the arterial intima, LDL undergoes pinocytosis by macrophages when it is at concentrations similar to those that occur in hyperlipidemic conditions, which results in foam cell formation<sup>40</sup>. This receptor-independent endocytic pathway also delivers cholesterol to the endolysosomal compartment and stimulates cholesterol esterification. Thus, rather than the originally envisioned single modification model — in which LDL and other APOB-containing lipoproteins would be rendered atherogenic — it is probable that multiple, simultaneous pathways contribute to foam cell formation *in vivo*.

**Pinocytosis**

Also known as fluid-phase endocytosis. A process of engulfment of extracellular fluid and its solutes. It can be mediated by an actin-dependent mechanism that results in the engulfment of large volumes (macropinocytosis) or by other mechanisms that result in the engulfment of smaller volumes (micropinocytosis).

**Efferocytosis**

The process of macrophage clearance of apoptotic cells.

**ATP-binding cassette subfamily A member 1 (ABCA1)**

A member of a superfamily of proteins that transport various molecules across extracellular and intracellular membranes using the energy of ATP hydrolysis. Eukaryotic ABC genes are classified in seven families, from ABCA to ABCG, on the basis of gene organization and primary sequence homology. Functional characterization can be partly made by differential sensitivity to inhibitory drugs.

**Autophagy**

An evolutionarily conserved process in which acidic double-membrane vacuoles sequester intracellular contents (such as damaged organelles and macromolecules) and target them for degradation, through fusion to secondary lysosomes.

**NLRP3 inflammasome**

A molecular complex containing NLRP3 (NOD-, LRR- and pyrin domain-containing 3) and the adaptor molecule ASC that controls the activity of caspase 1. Formation of this complex results in the cleavage of the highly pro-inflammatory cytokines pro-interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and pro-IL-18, thereby producing active IL-1β and IL-18.

---

plasma membrane also occurs<sup>47</sup>. ABCA1 promotes cholesterol efflux to lipid-poor APOA1, which is the building block of HDL, whereas ABCG1 promotes efflux to mature HDL particles. The genes encoding ABCA1 and ABCG1 are transcriptionally upregulated in response to elevated cellular cholesterol levels by liver X receptors (LXRs), which are ligand-activated nuclear receptors that function as sterol sensors; for example, LXR activation by cholesterol derivatives (such as oxysterols) or by desmosterol (which is a molecule similar to cholesterol)<sup>48</sup>, promotes macrophage cholesterol efflux via ABCA1 and ABCG1 and also has anti-inflammatory effects<sup>49</sup>. Thus, synthetic LXR agonists have been actively investigated for the treatment of atherosclerosis.

In addition, autophagy has a crucial role in macrophage cholesterol efflux: lipid droplets in macrophages and other cell types are targeted to and hydrolysed by the autophagy machinery in a process known as lipophagy<sup>50</sup>. Fusion of the autophagosome with the lysosome degrades cholesteryl esters and makes free and modified cholesterol available for efflux through an ABCA1-dependent pathway<sup>51</sup> (FIG. 2). The protective role of autophagy has been shown in studies in *Apoe*<sup>−/−</sup> mice in which the deletion of components of the autophagy machinery enhanced atherosclerosis<sup>52,53</sup>. Furthermore, autophagy regulates innate and adaptive immune responses (discussed below), including inflammasome activation, antigen presentation and T cell activation<sup>53–55</sup>. Thus, pathways that stimulate the efflux of cholesterol from the macrophage have two atheroprotective functions: they promote lipid homeostasis and they protect against inflammation.

---

**Defective cholesterol trafficking.** Macrophage cholesterol metabolism can become overwhelmed during excessive cholesterol uptake, which results in pathological processes. When stored in the cell as cholesteryl ester, cholesterol is fairly inert; however, free cholesterol can be toxic to cells. Enrichment of ER membranes with free cholesterol can result in defective cholesterol esterification by ACAT1 in macrophages, which promotes the further accumulation of free cholesterol. In addition, free cholesterol enrichment of cell membranes can enhance inflammatory signalling from lipid rafts, particularly Toll-like receptor (TLR) signalling and activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB)<sup>41–43</sup>. Furthermore, trafficking of free cholesterol out of lysosomes may also become defective in these macrophages, which constitutes a barrier to cholesterol efflux and further amplifies inflammation<sup>44</sup>. Such dysregulation in lipid metabolism contributes to ER stress in macrophages, which, if prolonged and combined with other insults, can ultimately result in apoptotic cell death<sup>45</sup>. Efficient clearance of apoptotic cells by surrounding macrophages (the process of efferocytosis) requires intact lipid metabolism pathways (such as cholesterol esterification and efflux) in the engulfing cell to deal with the ingested lipids from the apoptotic bodies. Thus, as macrophage lipid metabolism becomes dysregulated, the increase in macrophage apoptosis combined with defective efferocytosis results in secondary necrosis and in the release of cellular components and lipids that form the necrotic core<sup>46</sup>. This feature of advanced atherosclerotic plaques, along with the thinning of the fibrous cap, may increase the vulnerability of plaques to rupture.

---

**Innate immune activation**

Evidence supports the idea that innate immune activation is a central process in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. As reviewed above, dysregulated lipid metabolism contributes to the development of foam cells. Such aberrations and the resulting endogenous danger ligands that accumulate in atherosclerotic plaques trigger PRRs that are expressed by macrophages, including NOD-like receptors (NLRs), scavenger receptors and TLRs, thereby activating the inflammatory response.

---

**NLRs and inflammasome activation.** Cholesterol crystals are present in atherosclerotic plaques and are found in both extracellular spaces and within plaque macrophages. Although previously thought to be a feature of advanced plaques, a recent study using combined confocal-reflection microscopy showed the presence of cholesterol crystals in early lesions in *Apoe*<sup>−/−</sup> mice<sup>56,57</sup> and showed that macrophage engulfment of cholesterol crystals induces the NLRP3 inflammasome (FIG. 2). Uptake of pre-formed crystals by human and mouse macrophages induces lysosomal destabilization as well as the release of proteases and/or reactive oxygen species into the cytosol that activate NLRP3 (NOD-, LRR- and pyrin domain-containing 3), which leads to the processing and secretion of the cytokine IL-1β<sup>56,58–61</sup>. The potential importance of this pathway in atherogenesis was shown using LDL receptor (*Ldlr*)<sup>−/−</sup> mice, in which

---

**Lipid efflux.** Cells respond to excessive lipid accumulation by increasing the expression of pathways that promote the removal of cholesterol and other lipids from the cell. In foam cells several macrophage transporters facilitate the efflux of lipids — including ATP-binding cassette subfamily A member 1 (ABCA1), ABCG1 and SR-B1 (FIG. 2) — although passive diffusion from the
transplantation with bone marrow cells deficient in IL-1β or in components of the NLRP3 inflammasome complex led to reduced plaque formation<sup>56</sup>. A subsequent study using *Apoε*<sup>−/−</sup> mice with somatic deficiency of *Nlrp3* failed to show protection from atherosclerosis<sup>62</sup>. Although the reasons for this discrepancy will need to be investigated, a potential confounding factor may have been the different cholesterol contents of the Western diet used in the two studies (0.3% versus 1.25%).

In addition to pre-formed cholesterol crystals, recent work indicates that loading of macrophages with cholesterol can lead to the *de novo* formation of intracellular cholesterol crystals that trigger NLRP3 (REF. 63). CD36 has a crucial role in the accrual and the nucleation of cholesterol crystals within macrophages that have been treated with oxidized LDL, as well as in the ensuing lysosomal disruption and NLRP3 inflammasome activation<sup>63</sup>. Consequently, macrophages lacking CD36 failed to induce IL-1β production in response to oxidized LDL, and targeting CD36 in atherosclerotic mice decreased serum IL-1β levels and plaque cholesterol crystal accumulation. Notably, the CD36-mediated uptake of amyloid-forming peptides that are implicated in Alzheimer’s disease and type 2 diabetes also activates NLRP3. This suggests that there is a common pathway of lysosomal-mediated NLRP3 activation that occurs in the cell after the new aggregation and transformation of these soluble ligands into their pathogenic forms<sup>63</sup>. Although not yet investigated, other crystalline or amyloid substances in atherosclerotic plaques, such as calcium phosphate crystals or serum amyloid A<sup>64</sup>, may also represent damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) that could trigger the inflammasome and IL-1β secretion.

**TLR signalling.** The participation of TLR signalling pathways in the promotion of atherosclerosis is supported by mouse studies in which the whole body deletion of *Tlr2* or *Tlr4* (REFS 65–68) or of the adaptor proteins used by these TLRs, including IL-1 receptor-associated kinase 4 (IRAK4)<sup>69,70</sup>, TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6)<sup>71</sup>, TIR-domain-containing adaptor protein inducing IFNβ (TRIF; also known as TICAM1)<sup>72</sup> and myeloid differentiation primary-response protein 88 (MYD88)<sup>65,73</sup>, confers protection from atherosclerosis. This finding has initiated investigations of the endogenous ligands that accumulate during hypercholesterolaemia and in plaques that may trigger these microbial-sensing pathways in macrophages. Among the candidates proposed, oxidized LDL species have been extensively studied as ligands for both the scavenger receptors and the TLRs, and the extent of oxidation influences their recognition by these receptors (FIG. 2); for example, minimally oxidized LDL is recognized by CD14–TLR4–MD2 and initiates cytoskeletal rearrangements, as well as tumour necrosis factor (TNF), IL-6 and IL-10 production<sup>74</sup>. Moderately oxidized LDL that is recognized by CD36 signals via a heterodimer of TLR4 and TLR6, which results in NF-κB activation and in the expression of chemokines that promote monocyte recruitment to atherosclerotic

lesions<sup>67</sup>. Finally, oxidized phospholipids and saturated fatty acids induce cooperative signalling of CD36 and TLR2 that promotes apoptosis in macrophages undergoing prolonged ER stress<sup>75</sup>. However, in addition to these ligand-initiated signalling pathways, the enrichment of macrophage plasma membranes with free cholesterol can also lead to the sustained activation of various TLRs, including TLR3 and TLR4 (REFS 43,76). Thus, numerous pathways may contribute to the initiation and the maintenance of TLR-induced macrophage inflammation in atherosclerotic plaques.

**Macrophage polarization and plasticity**

One consequence of the TLR-dependent activation of monocyte-derived cells entering the plaque might be their polarization to M1 macrophages. These inflammatory macrophages secrete pro-atherosclerotic cytokines (such as IL-6 and IL-12), as well as reactive oxygen and nitrogen species that would exacerbate oxidative stress in the plaque<sup>77</sup> (BOX 1). Histological analysis of human plaques showed M1 macrophages to be enriched in lipids and localized to areas that are distinct from those in which the less inflammatory M2 macrophages (also known as alternatively activated macrophages) are localized<sup>78</sup>. Studies of M1 and M2 macrophages that have been polarized *in vitro* and in mouse models of atherosclerosis have led to a simplified view that M1 macrophages promote plaque inflammation and M2 macrophages resolve plaque inflammation. However, the phenotypic range of macrophages *in vivo* is likely to be complex, as macrophages encounter a microenvironment of diverse, and even opposing, signals; for example, in addition to inducing TLR signalling that can lead to M1 polarization, oxidized LDL has also been reported to induce the expression of the M2 macrophage phenotypic marker arginase 1 via the activation of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-γ (PPARγ)<sup>79</sup>. In addition, oxidized phospholipids present in oxidized LDL induce a macrophage phenotype that is distinct from M1 or M2 macrophage phenotypes and that has been termed Mox; these macrophages are characterized by the increased expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2; also known as NFE2L2)-dependent genes and reactive oxygen species<sup>80</sup>. It is probable that T helper 1 (*T*<sub>H</sub>1) and *T*<sub>H</sub>2 cells in plaques secrete macrophage-polarizing factors<sup>81</sup> that also contribute to the balance of M1 and M2 macrophages. Nonetheless, the factors in the plaque microenvironment that promote the polarization of these cells *in vivo* remain incompletely defined.

The recent identification of transcriptional programmes that regulate macrophage polarization has provided some insights into the effects of M1 and M2 macrophages on atherogenesis. Whole body or bone marrow-specific deletion of the transcription factor NR4A1 (also known as NUR77), which has been suggested to control the LY6C<sup>low</sup> patrolling monocyte phenotype and to favour M2 macrophage differentiation<sup>82</sup>, resulted in increased polarization of macrophages to an M1 macrophage phenotype and an acceleration of atherosclerosis in *Apoε*<sup>−/−</sup> and *Ldlr*<sup>−/−</sup> mice<sup>83,84</sup>, although

this result has been inconsistent ${ }^{85}$. Similarly, the targeted deletion of the transcription factor Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4), which promotes M2 macrophage polarization and inhibits M1 macrophage polarization ${ }^{86}$, enhanced both pro-inflammatory M1 macrophage activation and foam cell formation, and accelerated atherosclerosis in $Apoe^{-/-}$ mice ${ }^{87}$. Notably, the expression of KLF4 in macrophages is reduced by pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxidized phospholipids found in plaques ${ }^{87}$, which suggests that the KLF4-driven M2 macrophage phenotype may be repressed during atherogenesis and that this contributes to disease progression when such signals predominate. Indeed, the administration of the M2-polarizing cytokine IL-13 to $Ldlr^{-/-}$ mice was shown to drive plaque macrophages to M2-like cells and to inhibit atherosclerosis progression ${ }^{88}$. Moreover, an enrichment of M2 macrophages has been shown to occur in plaques in which the regression of atherosclerosis in mice (TABLE 1) is induced by aggressive lowering of lipids or raising of HDL levels ${ }^{4,5,89}$ (discussed further below). Collectively, these studies suggest that pathways that promote the M2 polarization of macrophages protect against atherosclerosis.

The origin of M1 and M2 macrophages in plaques remains an area of debate. Although it has been suggested that LY6C ${ }^{\mathrm{hi}}$ monocytes are the precursors of M1 macrophages, studies using $Apoe^{-/-}$ mice have shown that M2 macrophages populate early lesions (also known as fatty streaks), which are present at the stage in which LY6C ${ }^{\mathrm{hi}}$ monocytes are thought to be the predominant monocyte subset recruited into plaques. However, as plaques progress to more complex inflammatory lesions, the M1 macrophage phenotype becomes more frequent ${ }^{90}$. Further studies are needed to address the origins of M1 and M2 macrophages in atherosclerosis, particularly whether the recruitment of LY6C ${ }^{\text {low }}$ monocytes — thought to preferentially become M2 macrophages — predominate in the earliest lesions, whether there is interconversion between M1 and M2 macrophage phenotypes *in vivo*, or whether M2 macrophages are derived from the proliferation of a small population of tissue-resident M2 macrophages, as has recently described in other disease models ${ }^{91,92}$. A better understanding of the regulation of macrophage polarization is likely to offer insights into pathways that could be used for the potential manipulation of macrophage behaviour towards an atheroprotective state.

### Plaque macrophage retention and emigration

The number of macrophages in a plaque is kinetically determined by monocyte recruitment and local proliferation, and is counterbalanced by the emigration and death of macrophages. The factors that determine macrophage recruitment to plaques were discussed above. With regard to the local proliferation of monocyte-derived macrophages, this probably occurs in the plaque, as has been suggested by the assessment of proliferation markers in lesional macrophages and DCs ${ }^{93}$. Nevertheless, the quantitative importance of macrophage proliferation in atherosclerosis progression remains to be determined. Of note, on the basis of a recent report showing a lower percentage of proliferating macrophages in early plaques compared with advanced plaques, it is likely to be variable in different stages of the disease ${ }^{117}$.

Macrophage emigration has been shown to occur in early atherosclerotic plaques, but the rate of macrophage egress has been reported to decrease with atherosclerosis progression ${ }^{94}$ (FIG. 3). It is probable that plaque macrophages are subject to both retention and emigration signals, and that the balance of these forces contributes to the net accumulation of plaque macrophages. These signals are only beginning to be defined. Cholesterol loading of macrophages has been shown to increase the expression of the neuro-immune guidance cues netrin 1 and semaphorin 3E, which both function to induce macrophage chemostasis *in vitro* ${ }^{25,26}$. Macrophage expression of these migration-inhibitory molecules is also induced

Figure 3 | Pathways regulating macrophage retention and emigration in plaques. Imbalances in macrophage lipid metabolism in the progressing plaque lead to the retention of macrophages and to chronic inflammation. The accumulating lipid-laden macrophages express retention molecules (such as netrin 1 and its receptor UNC5B, semaphorin 3E and cadherins) that promote macrophage chemostasis. In this inflammatory milieu, these accumulating macrophages experience endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, which, if prolonged, results in apoptosis. This cell death, coupled with defective efferocytosis, results in the formation of the necrotic core that is characteristic of advanced plaques. The mechanisms that promote lipid unloading of the foam cell, including the factors that upregulate ATP-binding cassette subfamily A member 1 (ABCA1) expression on plaque macrophages and cholesterol efflux, reverse the accumulation of these foam cells. This plaque regression is characterized by an upregulation of CC-chemokine receptor 7 (CCR7) on myeloid-derived cells and a decrease in the expression of retention factors. The accumulating evidence summarized in this Review supports the idea that the regulation of these macrophage migration factors contributes to macrophage emigration from the plaque through reverse transmigration to the lumen or through trafficking to the adventitial lymphatics.

during hypoxia, which is intimately linked to atherosclerosis²⁶,⁹⁵; this occurs in mice⁹⁶ and has become recognized as a primary trigger of plaque inflammation. Studies using *Ldlr*⁻/⁻ mice with a bone marrow deficiency of netrin 1 showed that they had reduced atherosclerosis progression and increased macrophage emigration from lesions, which suggests that netrin 1 may function to retain macrophages in plaques²⁵. Similar experiments using mice that lack semaphorin 3E in macrophages will be needed to extend these findings and are in progress. Other factors that inhibit cell movement (such as adhesion molecules⁹⁷) or the resolution of inflammation are also likely to contribute to the retention of macrophages in the plaque, and studies comparing mouse models of atherosclerosis progression and regression are beginning to uncover these signals (see below).

The signals that guide macrophages to exit plaques, either by reverse transmigration through the endothelium to the lumen or by migrating through the media to the adventitial lymphatics, remain poorly defined. In studies in which macrophage emigration from plaques was induced by normalizing the hyperlipidemic plasma profile of mice in an aortic transplant model, the cells that emigrated expressed several markers that are characteristic of both macrophages and DCs⁹⁸; for example, the expression of CCR7, which is the receptor for the chemokines CCL19 and CCL21 that regulate DC homing to the lymph nodes, was upregulated in the emigrating CD68 (also known as macrosialin)-expressing cells. Furthermore, blocking this pathway led to substantial retention of these cells in the plaque⁹⁸. Further studies are needed to define other factors in this and other models of atherosclerosis regression.

REVIEWS

In addition, the continued presence of macrophage foam cells in the inflammatory lipid-rich environment of the plaque can eventually lead to cytotoxicity from ER and oxidative stress¹. Activation of ER stress responses occurs as a result of free cholesterol accumulation in macrophages and by saturated fatty acid signalling via SR-A1, TLR2 and TLR4 (REF. 75). Prolonged ER stress leads to macrophage apoptosis, which is observed in 2 to 4% of cells in mouse plaques, with the highest levels in advanced plaques. In these late-stage plaques, the ability of macrophages to clear their dying counterparts through such receptors as tyrosine protein kinase MER (MERTK) and LDLR-related protein 1 (LRP1) becomes compromised, and this has been partly attributed to cholesterol accumulation in the engulfing cells⁹⁹. This defective efferocytosis contributes to secondary necrosis and to the formation and expansion of the lipid cores, which, in turn, contribute to plaque vulnerability and to rupture⁴⁶. Therefore, it is possible that apoptosis, especially in the context of efficient efferocytosis, also contributes to net changes in macrophage or foam cell content, as has been suggested in a recent study of atherosclerosis regression¹⁰⁰; however, a mathematical analysis of those data suggest that a rate tenfold higher than usual would be required for the changes observed (S. Russell and E.A.F., unpublished observations). In summary, monocyte recruitment and cell retention, emigration and death are all potential kinetic contributors to the net plaque contents of macrophages and foam cells. The quantitative effect of each of these processes will probably vary during the different stages of the disease and in different models of progression and regression, as well as in co-morbid states, such as insulin resistance or diabetes, and chronic kidney disease.

Transcriptomic profiling of macrophages that have been isolated by laser capture microdissection⁹⁸ of progressing and regressing plaques in an aortic transplantation mouse model showed there to be >700 differentially regulated genes⁹⁷, including the recently described macrophage retention factors semaphorin 3E and netrin 1. Other genes that are downregulated in macrophages in regressing plaques include adhesion molecules, such as members of the cadherin family⁹⁷. By contrast, cellular motility factors were upregulated. In addition, CCR7 was expressed at low levels in plaque macrophages and was probably suppressed by hypercholesterolaemia as a result of a serum-response element in its promoter¹⁰⁵. Notably, the transcription of *Ccr7* was upregulated in macrophages when plaques were placed in a regression environment, thereby increasing the migratory capacity of the cells. Taken together, the transcriptomic data from the aortic transplantation model indicate that the emigration of macrophages from plaques is a highly regulated process, and reflect coordinated changes in macrophage retention and movement. Transcriptome analyses from other models of atherosclerosis regression will be needed to determine how conserved these changes are.

### Therapeutic targeting of plaque macrophages

Therapies that alter macrophage content by reducing macrophage recruitment to atherosclerotic plaques or by promoting macrophage apoptosis, efferocytosis or emigration have been proposed to have beneficial effects on disease. However, the quantitative effect of each of these processes on disease progression probably depends on the stage of disease; for example, macrophage recruitment dominates compared with emigration in disease progression, whereas macrophage emigration is increased in several models of atherosclerosis regression. Furthermore, the low level of macrophage apoptosis that is seen in early atherosclerosis (typically ~2–4% of cells) increases as plaques become more complex, with secondary necrosis also becoming prominent as the efferocytosis of apoptotic cells falters¹. In addition, as seen in models of progression and regression⁵,⁹⁰,⁹⁷, the inflammatory phenotype of the macrophages (using the simplified scheme of M1 versus M2 macrophages) is not constant, which probably reflects the well-known plasticity of monocyte-derived cells in response to microenvironmental changes. Therapies that alter macrophage inflammation by increasing polarization to an M2 macrophage phenotype, by increasing efferocytosis or by increasing macrophage emigration would be predicted to be beneficial on the basis of preclinical models.

The fact that new clinical targets are needed is obvious from the failure of conventional risk factor management to effectively eliminate the risk of cardiovascular disease, with more than half of patients in controlled clinical trials having heart attacks or strokes despite aggressive treatments. A recent example of the discovery of a potential target from mouse studies is our finding that neuronal guidance molecules function as macrophage retention factors in plaque progression and that their expression in macrophages decreases in regressing plaques²⁵,²⁶,⁹⁷. Thus, it may be desirable to selectively deliver small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), or other therapeutics directed against

Lessons from models of plaque regression

The historical focus on atherosclerosis in both human and animal studies has been on its progression, with the prevailing view that, except for early lesions which are dominated by foam cells, atherosclerosis was essentially irreversible, although the mechanisms by which even an immature plaque regressed remained undefined. More recent discoveries, including finding that macrophages can emigrate from plaques in some animal models and that tissue-remodelling M2 macrophages are present in human and animal plaques, suggest that there is cause for optimism that clinical atherosclerosis regression could be achieved. Nevertheless, understanding the biology of atherosclerosis regression, and the discovery of therapeutic targets to achieve it, requires robust preclinical models. Therefore, several mouse models of atherosclerosis, such as *Apoe⁻/⁻* mice and *Ldlr⁻/⁻* mice, have been adapted for studies of atherosclerosis regression (TABLE 1). Common to all models has been the finding that in the regressing plaque there is a decline in the number of macrophages and, in some, a change in their phenotypic characteristics, with an enrichment of M2 macrophage characteristics⁴⁻⁶,⁸⁹,¹⁰¹⁻¹⁰⁴, which suggests that this is a common signature of regressing plaques.

these and other factors that facilitate the emigration of macrophages. There is considerable optimism that it is possible to specifically target agents to modify the factors in plaques that are discussed above, on the basis of recent studies using nanoparticles, including reconstituted lipoproteins, to deliver siRNAs, imaging agents and small molecules to plaques ${ }^{106-108}$.

One obvious impediment to targeting macrophages in plaques is that targeting a specific process, such as monocyte recruitment, may be advantageous locally, but not desirable systemically. In addition, even if monocyte recruitment to plaques could be specifically blocked, the timing of the inhibition may be crucial. An example of this is that blocking monocyte recruitment via CCR2 may be an effective strategy in atherosclerosis progression, but recent investigations suggest that the shift in the phenotypic balance to the M2 macrophage phenotype during atherosclerosis regression in the aortic transplant model requires the recruitment of LY6C ${ }^{\mathrm{hi}}$ monocytes via CCR2 (Y. Vengrenyuk and E.A.F., unpublished observations), which is similar to what has been observed in autoimmune encephalomyelitis and allergic skin reactions ${ }^{109,110}$. Thus, the inhibition of CCR2 may impair atherosclerosis regression. Similarly, timing may also be an issue for targeting other chemokine receptors, such as CX3CR1 and CCR5, which, together with CCR2, control over 90% of monocyte entry into progressing plaques ${ }^{21}$.

The timing of strategies that therapeutically target macrophage death is also an important issue — it is expected that in early plaque development, when efferocytosis is efficient, increasing apoptosis would be beneficial. By contrast, efferocytosis is impaired in more complex plaques, and it is this that is relevant to clinical events. In complex plaques increasing apoptosis would lead to augmented release of macrophage lipid content and tissue factors that would expand the necrotic core and enhance its thrombogenicity. Current efforts are focused on maintaining levels of efferocytosis throughout plaque progression through the use of agents such as IL-10 or LXR agonists, which also have additional plaque benefits, such as reducing inflammation (in the case of IL-10 and LXR agonists) or promoting cholesterol efflux (in the case of LXR agonists). Increased lipid efflux would be expected to favourably affect the inflammatory state of macrophages ${ }^{43,76}$ and their ability to emigrate ${ }^{5}$ in addition to reducing plaque lipid content. In addition to LXR agonists, increasing autophagy ${ }^{51-53,111}$ or ABCA1 and ABCG1 expression levels by inhibiting the microRNA miR-33 (REF. 89) may help to target macrophage cholesterol efflux.

Another therapeutic strategy would be to reduce the inflammatory state of plaque macrophages. One approach to achieve this would be to polarize macrophages to the M2 phenotype, as these cells might be particularly important in the regressing atherosclerotic plaque as they have several crucial properties: they secrete anti-inflammatory factors and promote tissue remodelling and repair through the induction of collagen formation and the clearance of dying cells and debris; they secrete potent anti-inflammatory factors such as IL-10 and reduce the production of damaging reactive nitrogen species; and they express high levels of MERTK and thereby increase the efferocytosis of dying macrophages ${ }^{112,113}$. Thus, promoting the M2 macrophage phenotype in plaques would be expected to be beneficial in both atherosclerosis progression and regression, which is consistent with recent studies showing that $L d l r^{-/-}$ mice treated with IL-13 were protected from atherosclerosis ${ }^{88}$ and that M2 macrophages are required for disease regression in the aortic transplant model (Y. Vengrenyuk and E.A.F., unpublished observations). The manipulation of other factors that inhibit M1 macrophage polarization may be similarly successful in the context of atherosclerosis progression or regression.

### Conclusions and future perspective

Macrophages are the central cells in atherosclerosis, and the quantity and the phenotype of these cells in plaques influence both disease progression and regression. Both aspects of the disease are dynamic processes that represent a confluence of diverse metabolic and inflammatory pathways, and involve the entry of monocytes into plaques and the retention, emigration and death of lesional macrophages.

Important areas of future investigation include the regulation and the quantitative effect of each of these kinetic factors, the effects of other immune cells in the atheroma on the properties of macrophages, and the therapeutic manipulation of existing and newly discovered factors that affect the lipid content of macrophages, their number and their inflammatory phenotype. Despite the necessity of performing mechanistic studies in preclinical models, it will be important to relate these findings to human pathophysiology. This is starting to become a possibility, partly as a result of mining human genetic studies (such as genome-wide association studies) and various ‘omic’ characterizations of human tissues. A remaining challenge will be to use the present and ongoing research to design clinical interventions that reduce the unacceptably high risk of cardiovascular disease.
