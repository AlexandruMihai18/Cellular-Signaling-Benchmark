Trypanosomes and leishmania possess a thiol metabolism which completely differs from that of other eukaryotes and prokaryotes [1,2]. The glutathionylspermidine conjugates trypanothione (bis(glutathionyl)spermidine, T(SH)₂) and monoglutathionylspermidine (Gsp) are the main thiols of the parasites which are kept in the reduced state by the flavoenzyme trypanothione reductase [3,4]:

NADPH + TS₂ + H⁺ → NADP⁺ + T(SH)₂

Trypanosomatids lack the glutathione/glutathione reductase system as well as catalase and glutathione peroxidase. This fact may be responsible for their well known sensitivity towards oxidative stress [5]. On the other hand, low concentrations of hydrogen peroxide are tolerated by *Trypanosoma cruzi* which is attributed completely to the non-enzymatic reduction by trypanothione [6]. These observations raise the question: Does the parasite-specific trypanothione exert further antioxidant functions that are not equally well fulfilled by glutathione?

Recently Clark et al. [7] reported the presence of ascorbate (AA) and dehydroascorbate (DHA) reductase (glutathione:dehydroascorbate oxidoreductase; EC 1.8.5.1) in *T. cruzi* and suggested an enzyme-based vitamin C redox cycle in the parasites.

Since glutathionylspermidine conjugates [4,8–11] are major thiols in trypanosomatids we studied the reduction of dehydroascorbate by trypanothione and monoglutationyl spermidine in comparison to that by glutathione and lipoic acid. Here we will show that the non-enzymatic reduction of dehydroascorbate by trypanothione:

DHA + T(SH)₂ → AA + TS₂

Thiol concentration [mM]

Fig. 1. Spontaneous reduction of dehydroascorbate by different thiols. Trypanothione disulfide and glutathionylspermidine disulfide were purchased from Bachem, Switzerland. T(SH)₂ and Gsp were prepared by reduction of the disulfides with DTE (dithiothreitol) and separation of the reaction products using HPLC with a gradient of CH₃CN in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Stock solutions of 7.75 mM T(SH)₂ and 60 mM Gsp, respectively in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 100 mM Lip(SH)₂ (lipoic acid) in ethanol containing 10% 10 mM HCl and 220 mM GSH in 10 mM HCl were stored at –20°C. The thiol concentration of the solutions was determined using Ellman’s reagent prior to use. The 10 mM dehydroascorbate (DHA) solution in H₂O was freshly prepared. Each reaction mixture (A–D) contained the respective thiol in 100 mM potassium phosphate, 1 mM EDTA, pH 6.5. The reaction was started by addition of 200 μM dehydroascorbate and the formation of ascorbate was followed at 25°C by the absorption increase at 265 nm (Δε = 14.000 M⁻¹ cm⁻¹). Initial rates were obtained during the first 3 min following addition of DHA. At least during this period, the rates were linear. No correction had to be made for hydrolysis of DHA to diketogulonic acid, a reaction which becomes prominent at 37°C, higher pH-values, and longer reaction times [12,13]. Points are the average of two measurements which differed by less than 5%. Each set of experiments was carried out at least in duplicate.

is two to three orders of magnitude faster than by  
glutathione:

DHA + 2GSH → AA + GSSG

Evidence is provided that in trypanothione-dependent organisms the regeneration of ascorbate is solely due to the spontaneous reduction of DHA by trypanothione which in turn is regenerated by trypanothione reductase.

The nonenzymatic reduction of DHA by the different thiols was followed at pH 6.5. The second order rate constant for the reduction of DHA by trypanothione at pH 6.5 is 1300 M⁻¹ min⁻¹. As shown in Fig. 1, the reduction of 220 μM DHA by 10 μM T(SH)₂ (A) is 10 times faster than by 1 mM GSH (D). The monothiol glutathionylspermidine (B) is also more effective than GSH but, as expected, much less reactive than trypanothione. Even in comparison to dithiol lipoic acid (C), which reduces DHA faster than GSH [13] and which has a much lower redox potential (−284 mV) than the other thiols discussed in this paper (−230 to −250 mV) [14], trypanothione is 10 times more reactive. Because of its low intracellular concentration, free lipoic acid is not likely to play a role in the reduction of dehydroascorbate in vivo. The mitochondrial 2-oxoacid dehydrogenases have recently been shown to reduce DHA in a lipoic acid-dependent reaction [15].

The reactivity of all four thiols towards DHA was strongly pH dependent in accordance with the thiolate being the reactive species. Between pH 6.5 and 7.5, the reaction rates increased by about one order of magnitude. Comparing the pH dependence of DHA reduction by T(SH)₂ and GSH indicated that the pK value of T(SH)₂ is lower than that of GSH in accordance with pub-

published data [16]. The outstanding reducing capacity towards DHA of trypanothione in comparison to the other thiols may be due to two effects, namely the lowering of the pK-value of the SH-groups by the adjacent ammonium group of the spermidine bridge [16] and the formation of an intramolecular disulfide upon T(SH)₂ oxidation.

In order to study the possibility that reduction of DHA in the parasite is an enzyme-catalyzed process, protein extracts were prepared as follows: 5.5 g frozen epimastigote *T. cruzi* (Brazil strain) was thawed in the presence of 15 ml 100 mM potassium phosphate, 1 mM EDTA, pH 6.5 containing 0.6 mg digitonin, 100 μM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 150 nM pepstatin. After gently shaking at 25°C for 15 min the suspension was centrifuged for 30 min at 20,000 × g and 4°C. The supernatant was kept on ice. To the cell pellet, 5 ml of the buffer described above was added and the suspension was frozen and thawed two times. After centrifugation the resulting supernatant was combined with the first one yielding the ‘crude extract’ (25 ml; 9 mg ml⁻¹ protein); 2 ml crude extract was heated to 65°C for 5 min and then rapidly cooled down in an ice bath. Centrifugation resulted in a ‘heat-treated extract’ (6 mg ml⁻¹ protein). Another 2 ml crude extract was extensively dialyzed against 100 mM potassium phosphate, 1 mM EDTA, pH 6.5 yielding the dialyzed extract (8.5 mg ml⁻¹ protein). In all steps protein concentration was determined using the method of Warburg and Christian [17]. The extracts were portioned and frozen at –20°C.

When studying the influence of *T. cruzi* proteins on the reduction of dehydroascorbate by glutathione, the reaction mixture contained 5 mM GSH and 220 μM DHA in 100 mM potassium phosphate, 1 mM EDTA, pH 6.5. The presence of 0.2, 0.13, and 0.19 mg ml⁻¹ total protein in crude, heat treated and dialyzed extracts, respectively, did not cause any increase in the rate of ascorbate formation. Triplicate experiments gave values that differed from each other by less than 5%. pH 6.5 was chosen since at this pH the spontaneous reaction between glutathione and DHA is relatively slow [16,18,19] which allows the detection of a slight enzymic acceleration [20]. In addition, also in the system described by Stahl et al. [21] with 2 mM GSH, 1 mM DHA in 50 mM potassium phosphate, 0.27 mM EDTA, pH 6.8 at 37°C, the presence of *T. cruzi* extract (0.3 mg ml⁻¹ protein) had no influence on ascorbate formation. The same results were obtained with the coupled assay system [18]:

DHA + 2GSH → AA + GSSG  
GSSG + NADPH + H⁺ → 2GSH + NADP⁺  

where nascent GSSG is reduced in the glutathione reductase (GR) catalyzed reaction and NADPH consumption is followed at 340 nm and 25°C. The reaction mixtures (1 ml) contained 100 μM NADPH, 5 mM GSH and 100 mM potassium phosphate, 1 mM EDTA, pH 6.5. Addition of 0.4 U human GR [22] caused a sharp drop in absorption at 340 nm due to consumption of GSSG present in the GSH sample. After 2 min, a stable baseline was obtained and the direct reaction was started by adding 200 μM DHA (ΔA₃₄₀ₙₘ = 0.0075 min⁻¹). Addition of 20 μl *T. cruzi* crude extract led to an increase in the absorption change by 0.0048 min⁻¹ which might represent a protein-mediated ‘DHA-reductase’ activity. However, adding the protein extract first, resulted in an absorption decrease of 0.0067 min⁻¹ which probably is GR activity due to oxidation of GSH by components of the extract. Subsequent addition of DHA increased the absorption change by 0.0066 min⁻¹. This reaction rate — which corresponds to the sum of the direct and a putative ‘enzymic’ reduction — was not faster than the spontaneous reaction. The values given are from a representative experiment. In total, the experiments were repeated four times. In all of these studies the values representing the direct plus enzymic reaction were slightly lower than that for the direct reaction alone. In conclusion, we found no indication for an effective enzyme catalysis for the GSH dependent reduction of DHA in our *T. cruzi* epimastigote extract.

The GSH-DHA reductase activity of 4–24 mU mg⁻¹ found in *T. cruzi* epimastigotes [7] which was measured at pH 7.0 is only one-tenth of the direct reaction between GSH and DHA at this pH-value. Since the non-enzymatic reduction by trypanothione is at least two orders of magnitude

faster than that by glutathione, the ‘GSH-DHA reductase’ activity seems not be of physiological significance for the parasite to keep ascorbate in the reduced state.

The reduction of DHA by trypanothione was also not accelerated by addition of *T. cruzi* protein extracts. In the coupled trypanothione assay:

DHA + T(SH)₂ → AA + TS₂  
TS₂ + NADPH + H⁺ → T(SH)₂ + NADP⁺

the trypanothione disulfide formed is reduced by trypanothione reductase. The reaction mixture (87 μl total volume) contained 100 μM NADPH, 11 μM T(SH)₂, 16 mU TR, 230 μM DHA and 0.21 mg ml⁻¹ protein of the crude extract. By varying the order of additives as described for the GR system we could not detect any enzymatic acceleration of the T(SH)₂ dependent reduction of DHA.

In the direct trypanothione system containing 11.4 μM T(SH)₂ and 235 μM DHA in 85 μl 100 mM potassium phosphate, 1 mM EDTA, pH 6.5, addition of 0.2–0.4 mg ml⁻¹ protein of the extracts caused a decline of the initial reaction rate which may be due to consumption of the low amounts of T(SH)₂ in thiol disulfide exchanges with components of the extract [23]. Higher concentrations of the extracts could not be tested because of the strong absorption increase.

In order to show that a DHA reductase activity is detectable under the conditions used, we studied the influence of *E. coli* glutaredoxin (purchased from IMCO Corporation, Stockholm, Sweden) on DHA reduction. The reaction mixtures (total volume 90 μl) contained the thiols (5 mM GSH, 50 μM Lip(SH)₂, or 10 μM T(SH)₂, respectively) in 100 mM potassium phosphate, 1 mM EDTA, pH 6.5. The concentration of glutaredoxin was varied between 0 and 167 μg ml⁻¹. After addition of 220 μM DHA, the formation of ascorbate was followed by the absorption increase at 265 nm. *E. coli* glutaredoxin catalyzed the glutathione-dependent reduction of dehydroascorbate with a specific activity of about 2 U mg⁻¹. The effect of glutaredoxin on the trypanothione- and lipoic acid-dependent reactions, respectively was much lower. The dithiols were used

in micromolar concentrations because of their much higher reactivity towards dehydroascorbate. Therefore the reaction rates could not be directly compared with that of GSH.

It is not our intention to contribute to the arguments of enzymatic versus nonenzymatic reduction of dehydroascorbate by glutathione in higher eucaryotes (for reviews, see [13] and [24]). Detailed studies revealed that several proteins, for instance glutaredoxin, possess DHA reductase activity [15,25]. Since the magnitude of these activities relative to the uncatalyzed rate is usually not more than two- to fivefold higher [26], the spontaneous reduction represents a major physiological reaction.

In trypanosomes and leishmania, trypanothione is a main low molecular weight thiol. In many trypanosomatids the intracellular concentration of T(SH)₂ is about 1 mM which is not significantly lower than the GSH concentration in most eucaryotic cells. As shown here, the dithiol is two to three orders of magnitude more reactive than GSH towards DHA. The DHA concentration in *T. cruzi* epimastigotes and trypomastigotes ranges between 20 and 100 μM [7]. With these data and the second order rate constant of 1300 M⁻¹ min⁻¹ which was measured at pH 6.5, it can be calculated that DHA is completely turned over in less than 1 min. It should be mentioned here that *T. cruzi* epimastigotes are an exception in having trypanothione concentrations of about 80 μM [10,11] which means that at pH 6.5 and 25°C turnover of 30 μM DHA would take more than 10 min. However, under physiological conditions at 37°C and pH 7.4 the reaction rate is computed to be about 100-fold faster. In *T. cruzi* epimastigotes grown in the absence of any polyamine, T(SH)₂ concentrations of less than 14 μM in the presence of 500 μM glutathione have been found [11]. Also under acute oxidative stress conditions extremely low T(SH)₂ levels are conceivable which might render important the trypanothione-glutathione thioltransferase activity of the parasite [23]. On the other hand, the initial rate of DHA reduction with only 5 μM T(SH)₂ is as high as that with 3 mM GSH (Fig. 1A,D). From a physiological perspective, the inability of the parasite to synthesize polyamines from amino acid precu-

sors does not seem to play a limiting role in the availability of T(SH)₂ since epimastigote *T. cruzi* in the gut of the insect vector as well as the amastigotes living in the cytosol of their host cells can rely on the surrounding polyamine pools [11]. Consequently, the spontaneous reaction between T(SH)₂ and DHA can be regarded as sufficient for practically all metabolic situations. The results presented in this report support the occurrence of a vitamin C redox cycle in *T. cruzi* [5,27] but we found no indication for the existence of a specific dehydroascorbate reductase as described in [7].
