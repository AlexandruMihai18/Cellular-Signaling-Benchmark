## ABSTRACT  

Although the ability of growth hormone (GH) to stimulate body growth and regulate metabolism has been recognized for many years, only recently has insight been gained into the molecular mechanisms by which binding of GH to its receptor (GHR) elicits its diverse effects. This review provides an overview of what is currently known about the molecular mechanisms of GH action. The model presented is one in which GH binding to two GHRs causes dimerization of GHR, activation of the GHR-associated JAK2 tyrosine kinase, and tyrosyl phosphorylation of both JAK2 and GHR. These events recruit and/or activate a variety of signaling molecules, including MAP kinases, insulin receptor substrates, phosphatidylinositol 3′ phosphate kinase, diacylglycerol, protein kinase C, intracellular calcium, and Stat transcription factors. These signaling molecules contribute to the GH-induced changes in enzymatic activity, transport function, and gene expression that ultimately culminate in changes in growth and metabolism.  

## INTRODUCTION  

For understanding regulation of normal growth and metabolism, it is essential to understand the molecular basis of growth hormone (GH) action. Until recently, insight into the molecular mechanisms by which binding of GH to its receptor (GHR) elicits changes in cellular activities has been limited. Our understanding of GH signaling has been greatly aided by cloning of the cDNA encoding GHR (72); by classification of GHR as a member of the cytokine/hematopoietin receptor superfamily (9); by recognition that one GH molecule binds to two GHRs (26, 32); and by the recent identification of JAK2 as a GHR-associated tyrosine kinase activated in response to GH (4). As a result of these important findings, a number of signaling molecules with

known function have now been identified that interact with GHR, JAK2, and/or an associated protein. Signaling pathways utilizing these and other signaling molecules, as well as their cellular endpoints, have also begun to be identified. While the details of all of these GH/GHR signaling pathways are not yet known and other pathways remain to be determined, the studies summarized in this review have advanced our knowledge of the signaling cascades initiated by GH binding to its receptor, thereby providing important insight into how GH elicits its diverse effects on growth and metabolism.

GH SIGNALING MECHANISMS 189

# STRUCTURE OF THE GH RECEPTOR

GHR was first cloned from rabbit and human liver cDNA libraries (72) and has now been cloned from liver cDNA libraries of rat, mouse, cow, pig, sheep, and chicken (reviewed in 68). The cDNAs encode a ~70-kDa protein containing a single membrane-spanning domain (Figure 1), which migrates as a ~120–130-kDa protein in SDS-polyacrylamide gels when expressed in mammalian cells (4, 72, 115, 131). Glycosylation and possibly ubiquitination contribute to the larger size of the expressed protein (57, 72). Deletions and point mutations in the GHR gene in individuals with Laron dwarfism (1, 2, 47) provide evidence that the cloned GHR is important for human growth. The cloned GHR has also been shown to increase insulin biosynthesis when expressed in RIN5-AH cells (15) and cellular proliferation in Ba/F3 and FDC-P1 cells (23, 132). In CHO cells, expressed GHR stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins, microtubule-associated protein (MAP) kinase activity, intracellular Ca²⁺ concentrations, Stat protein activation, c-fos expression, protein synthesis, and glucose transport (14, 38, 49, 80; LS Smit, DJ Meyer, N Billestrup, G Norstedt, J Schwartz & C Carter-Su, submitted).

Based upon sequence analysis, GHR is classified as a member of the cytokine/hematopoietin receptor superfamily (9). This superfamily also includes receptor subunits for prolactin (PRL) and a variety of cytokines and growth factors, including erythropoietin (EPO), interleukins (ILs) 2–7, 9, 11, and 12, thrombopoietin, leukemia-inhibitory factor (LIF) (60, 86, 129). Receptors for IFN α/β, IFNγ, and IL-10 are more distantly related and are considered class II receptors in this family (9, 61). Members of this family have a single membrane-spanning domain and limited homology in the extracellular domain, including a stretch of about 210 amino acids conserved at a relatively low level (15–35%), four cysteines, a tryptophan, and a membrane-proximal WSXWS motif (69). The WXSWX motif in GHR contains conservative substitutions and has been postulated to play a critical role in ligand binding (32).

In its cytoplasmic domain, GHR shares two motifs with other members of the cytokine receptor superfamily. One is a membrane-proximal, proline-rich motif referred to as Box 1. It is present in all members and consists of eight amino acids (ψ-X-X-X-Al-P-X-P, where ψ represents hydrophobic residues and Al represents aliphatic residues) (8, 24, 82, 84). This motif in mammalian GHR contains ILPPVPVP. The second cytoplasmic motif (Box 2), present in many cytokine receptors, begins with a cluster of hydrophobic amino acids and ends with one or two positively charged amino acids (82). In GHR, Box 2 is located approximately 30 amino acids carboxy terminal to Box 1 and spans about 15 amino acids (28). Mutation or deletion of Box 1 and/or Box 2 in

GHR and other cytokine receptor family members results in defective ligand-mediated cellular growth in IL-3-dependent cell lines expressing the appropriate receptor, suggesting that these regions play critical roles in receptor-mediated signal transduction (7, 28, 45, 48, 59, 82, 132).

# GHR SIGNAL TRANSDUCTION

## GH Binding and Receptor Dimerization

Based on crystallography, size exclusion chromatography, calorimetry, and fluorescence quenching experiments using solubilized extracellular domain of the GHR (denoted GHBP), one GH is hypothesized to complex with two GHRs (26, 32). The binding of GH to GHBP appears to be sequential, leading to the hypothesis that GH binding causes GHR dimerization (Figure 2). Studies in which ${}^{125}$I-hGH is covalently cross-linked to full-length or truncated GHR indicate that like GHBP, GHR also forms dimers (L Rui, LS Argetsinger, D Virgo & C Carter-Su, unpublished data), although whether dimer formation is GH dependent is not yet known. The finding that a mutated GH (G120R) that fails to induce GHBP dimerization is biologically inactive when added to cells expressing GHR (44, 102, 138) suggests that GH-induced dimerization of GHR is required for GH action. Additional changes in GHR conformation resulting from the binding of GH to two GHRs are also likely to be important for GH signaling.

## Activation of JAK2 Tyrosine Kinase by GH

Among the most rapid cellular responses to GH are the binding of the tyrosine kinase JAK2 to GHR and the activation of JAK2 (4, 128). JAK2 is a member of the Janus family of cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases that currently include JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and tyk2 (40, 58, 105, 133, 136). Although initially GH was not observed to activate JAK1 in 3T3-F442A fibroblasts or IM-9 cells (4, 102), additional studies using a higher affinity JAK1 antibody demonstrated that GH induces low-level tyrosyl phosphorylation of JAK1 in 3T3-F442A fibroblasts and COS cells transfected with cDNAs for both murine GHR and JAK1 (LS Smit, DJ Meyer, N Billestrup, G Norstedt, J Schwartz & C Carter-Su, submitted; W-H Huo & C Carter-Su, unpublished data). GH also stimulates the tyrosyl phosphorylation of JAK3 in a transformed T-cell line, although to a significantly lesser extent than the potent activator of JAK3, IL-2 (67). Thus, whereas JAK2 appears to be the primary JAK family member activated by GH, JAK1 and JAK3 may also be activated by GH and thereby mediate at least some effects of GH. Whether GH activates Tyk2 is unclear. Although GH-dependent phosphorylation of Tyk2 was not detected in IM-9 cells (4),

Figure 2 GHR Signaling pathways. Possible signaling pathways initiated by binding of GH to its receptor are shown. The dotted lines indicate molecules or pathways that have not yet been shown to be involved in GH-dependent signal transduction but are likely to be employed by GH because they are utilized by other growth factors that activate the indicated downstream signaling molecules.

experimental conditions were such that a low level of activation might have been missed.

Activation of JAK kinases is a characteristic shared among members of the cytokine receptor family, with different ligands showing preferences for different JAK family members (4, 40, 67, 113, 135, 136). The origin of specificity in response to GH rather than to other ligands that activate JAK kinases is an issue of obvious importance. The source is likely found in cell-specific receptor expression, activation of different combinations of JAK family members, different magnitudes and time course of activation for each JAK, interaction of JAK signaling pathways with other signaling pathways, as well the binding of different downstream signaling molecules to phosphorylated tyrosine-containing motifs specific to each receptor. It is interesting to note that in 3T3-F442A fibroblasts, GH stimulates tyrosyl phosphorylation of JAK2 more than 15 times more effectively than IFNγ or LIF. In contrast, the three ligands stimulate tyrosyl phosphorylation of JAK1 to similar extents (5; LS Smit, DJ Meyer, N Billestrup, G Norstedt, J Schwartz & C Carter-Su, submitted).

Studies using truncated and mutated GHR have implicated the Box 1 motif as a necessary component for GH-dependent JAK2 association with GHR and for tyrosyl phosphorylation and activation of JAK2 (42, 109, 128, 132). Specific deletion of Box 1 destroys GHR-JAK2 association and GH-dependent JAK2 phosphorylation. Interestingly, mutation to alanine of a single proline in this region of human GHR also abolishes GH-induced JAK2 tyrosyl phosphorylation (132). Although the Box 1 motif appears to play a primary role in GHR-JAK2 association, more distal regions appear to augment the interaction (42, 109, 119). Similarly, membrane-proximal regions containing Box 1 and/or 2 of the cytoplasmic domains of EPO-R, PRL-R, and gp130 have been implicated in JAK2-receptor association and/or JAK2 activation (28, 119, 135). The mechanism by which GH or other cytokines activate JAK kinases is not known. However, one hypothesis consistent with what is known about GHR structure and tyrosine kinase activation in general is that binding of GH to two GHR molecules increases the affinity of JAK2 for each GHR and allows two JAK2 molecules to come into sufficiently close proximity to transphosphorylate one or more tyrosines in the kinase domain of the paired JAK2, thereby activating JAK2.

Consistent with the activation of JAK2 as an initial signaling event for GHR, GHR mutants that lack the JAK2 binding site fail to elicit GH-dependent increased tyrosyl phosphorylation of SHC proteins, IRS 1 and 2, and extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) 1 and 2 in CHO cells, increased insulin synthesis, induction of the *spi* 2.1 gene, and GH-dependent mitogenesis in FDC-P1 cells and Ba/F3 cells (13, 23, 51, 79, 132). Thus it is possible that a primary role of GH binding to GHR is to facilitate recruitment and activation of JAK2. Subsequent signaling events may require JAK2 and not necessarily GHR itself. Consistent with this hypothesis, a rat GHR/JAK2 chimera directly linking the C-terminal one-third of JAK2 to the external and transmembrane domains of GHR conveys GH-dependent transcriptional activation via the *c-fos* promoter (43).

## GH-Dependent Tyrosyl Phosphorylation of GHR and JAK2

Tyrosine kinase signaling is often mediated by the binding of Src-homology 2 (SH2) domain-containing signaling proteins to phosphorylated tyrosines in the kinase itself or in other kinase substrates (87). In response to GH, both JAK2 and GHR become phosphorylated on tyrosines (4, 41, 101), presumably as a result of JAK2 activation. The presence of 48 tyrosines in murine JAK2 suggests that multiple signaling molecules may interact with JAK2 (105). Which tyrosines are phosphorylated in response to GH or other activating ligands is not presently known. The cytoplasmic domain of rat GHR contains a more limited number (10) of potential tyrosyl phosphorylation sites. Of these,

six (Y333, Y487, Y534, Y566, Y595, and Y626) are conserved in all cloned species of GHR. Experiments using truncated and mutated rat GHR indicate that GHR is phosphorylated on tyrosines in both the C- and N-terminal halves of the cytoplasmic domain (127a). Y534 is reported to be the strongest phosphorylation site in the cytoplasmic domain of pig GHR (X Wang, CJ Darus, N Billestrup & JJ Kopchick, submitted). In the N-terminal half of rat GHR, Y333 and/or Y338 appear to be the predominant phosphorylation sites (127a). Consistent with the importance of phosphorylated tyrosines for GH signaling, mutational analysis indicates that Y534 and Y566 in pig GHR are required for GH-dependent activation of *spi* 2.1/CAT constructs and that Y487 and Y534 are required for GH-promoted tyrosyl phosphorylation of pp95 (X Wang, CJ Darus, N Billestrup & JJ Kopchick, submitted). Y333 and/or Y338 have been reported to be required for GH-stimulated lipid and protein synthesis (74).

### Activation of MAP Kinases by GH

In addition to GHR and JAK2, a large number of other proteins become tyrosyl phosphorylated in response to GH (16, 54, 103). This suggests that JAK2 phosphorylates proteins in addition to JAK2 and GHR and/or that proteins that bind to activated JAK2 and/or GHR initiate signaling pathways involving other tyrosine kinases or phosphatases. The first two GH-dependent tyrosyl phosphorylated proteins identified were the MAP kinases designated ERKs 1 and 2 (3, 18, 134). MAP kinases, activated by a number of receptor and nonreceptor tyrosine kinases, including GH (3, 18, 134), are believed to play a critical role in the regulation of growth and differentiation (22).

One pathway leading from membrane receptor tyrosine kinases to MAP kinases involves SHC, Grb2, son-of-sevenless (Sos), ras, raf, and MAP/ERK kinase (MEK) (25). GH has been demonstrated to promote rapid tyrosyl phosphorylation of the 66-, 52-, and 46-kDa SHC proteins in 3T3-F442A fibroblasts (127). GH also induces the binding of a GHR-JAK2 complex to the SH2 domain of the SHC proteins fused to glutathione S-transferase (GST) and the association of Grb2 with SHC. These results suggest that GH stimulates the association of SHC proteins with JAK2-GHR complexes via the SH2 domain of SHC proteins. SHC is then tyrosyl phosphorylated by JAK2, which permits the binding of Grb2 to SHC. Although GH has not been shown to activate the remaining molecules in this signaling cascade (Sos, ras, raf, and MEK), it seems likely that the recruitment of SHC and Grb2 are early events in GH activation of ERKs 1 and 2 via this pathway. GH activation of MAP kinases requires the proline-rich Box 1 of GHR, the same region implicated in JAK activation, providing further evidence for a role of JAK2 in the activation of MAP kinases (128). MAP kinase substrates include other protein kinases (e.g., c-Raf-1, the S6 kinases designated p70<sup>rsk</sup> and p90<sup>rsk</sup>), phospholi-

194 CARTER-SU, SCHWARTZ & SMIT

pase A₂, cytoskeletal proteins, and transcription factors (e.g., c-Jun and ternary complex factors (TCFs), including p62<sup>TCF</sup>/Elk-1) (reviewed in 31). Of these, GH has been shown to activate the S6 kinase, p90<sup>rsk</sup>, in 3T3-F442A fibroblasts (3). Presumably some of the other substrates are phosphorylated by MAP kinases in response to GH and are responsible for other actions of GH.

# Utilization of IRS-1, IRS-2, and PI 3′ Kinase by GH

Under certain circumstances, GH is known to have rapid, insulin-like effects, including increased glucose transport as a consequence of the recruitment of Glut1 and Glut 4 transporters to the plasma membrane (30, 50, 120; H Feng & C Carter-Su, unpublished data; T-W Gong & J Schwartz, unpublished data), which suggests that GH and insulin may share some signaling molecules. A principal substrate of the insulin receptor, IRS-1, has been shown to be tyrosyl phosphorylated in response to GH in primary cultures of rat adipocytes, 3T3-F442A fibroblasts, and CHO cells expressing recombinant GHR (5, 90, 110). Recent studies indicate that GH also stimulates tyrosyl phosphorylation of IRS-2 (LS Argetsinger, MG Myers Jr, N Billestrup, G Norstedt, MF White & C Carter-Su, submitted), an IRS-1 related protein (117a).

In studies using truncated and mutated GHRs expressed in CHO cells, the region of GHR required for GH-induced tyrosyl phosphorylation of IRS-1 and IRS-2 corresponded to that required for JAK2 association and activation. Specific tyrosines in GHR were not required for IRS phosphorylation (5; LS Argetsinger, MG Myers Jr, N Billestrup, G Norstedt, MF White & C Carter-Su, submitted), consistent with the absence of a putative IRS-1 binding site in GHR (85). These findings suggest that the role of GHR in GH-dependent tyrosyl phosphorylation of IRS-1 and -2 is to activate JAK2. Upon autophosphorylation, JAK2 then binds to and phosphorylates IRS-1 and -2 directly or via an intermediary protein.

Tyrosines in IRS-1 and -2 that are phosphorylated in response to insulin or IGF-1 provide binding sites for multiple SH2 domain-containing proteins, including the 85-kDa regulatory subunit of PI 3′ kinase (116, 117). GH also stimulates binding of IRS-1 and -2 to the 85-kDa regulatory subunit of PI 3′ kinase (5, 90; LS Argetsinger, MG Myers, Jr, N Billestrup, G Norstedt, MF White & C Carter-Su, submitted). PI 3′ kinase has been implicated in the stimulatory actions of insulin on glucose transport, DNA synthesis, and activity of p70<sup>rsk</sup>, an enzyme implicated in cell cycle regulation (20). Consistent with a role for PI 3′ kinase in the insulin-like metabolic effects of GH, the PI 3′ kinase inhibitor wortmannin blocks the ability of GH to stimulate lipid synthesis (and presumably its rate-limiting step, glucose transport) and to inhibit noradrenaline-induced lipolysis in rat adipocytes (91). Like GH stimulation of phosphorylation of IRS-1 and IRS-2, stimulation by GH of lipid synthesis and

glucose transport requires the N-terminal, but not the C-terminal, half of GHR (49, 80).

# The Role of Protein Kinase C in Signaling by GH

Several lines of evidence suggest that protein kinase C (PKC) plays a role in GH-initiated signal transduction. Rapid, transient induction by GH of relatively small increases in DAG, a known activator of PKC, have been reported (36, 66, 93, 125). In Ob1771 preadipocytes, the change in DAG is accompanied by increased levels of phosphocholine and is blocked by pertussis toxin (19), suggesting that GH mediates DAG production by means of phosphatidylcholine breakdown involving a phospholipase C coupled to the GHR via a pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein. In contrast, in kidney proximal tubule membranes, the change in DAG is accompanied by rapid, transient increases in levels of inositol triphosphate (IP₃) (93). Whether GH-dependent PKC activation lies downstream of JAK2 or is a JAK-independent pathway remains to be determined. PtdIns-3,4-P2 and PtdIns-3,4,5-P3, byproducts of PI 3′ kinase, have recently been shown to activate the Ca²⁺-independent PKC isoforms, γ, ε, and η (123). This raises the possibility that GH may also activate PKC via a pathway involving IRS proteins and PI 3′ kinase.

Chronic treatment of cells with phorbol ester 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) to deplete PKC, and/or addition of inhibitors of PKC, markedly reduce the ability of GH to stimulate lipogenesis (108), induce c-fos expression (56, 107, 125), stimulate binding of nuclear protein to C/EBP oligonucleotide (21), and increase [Ca²⁺]i (S Gaur, H Yamaguchi & HM Goodman, submitted), suggesting that these actions of GH may require activation of PKC or be modulated by PKC. Although some studies (3) also suggest a role for PKC in the GH-dependent activation of MAP kinases and p90<sup>rsk</sup>, others argue against such a role (18, 134).

# Regulation of Intracellular Calcium by GH

GH has been reported to cause an increase in intracellular free calcium concentrations in freshly isolated rat adipocytes (96, 98), IM-9 lymphocytes (62), and in CHO cells expressing rat GHR (14). This increase is dependent upon the presence of extracellular Ca²⁺ and is blocked by verapamil and nimodipine (14; S Gaur, H Yamaguchi & HM Goodman, submitted), which suggests that GH activates voltage-sensitive L-type calcium channels. The GH-induced increase in [Ca²⁺]i in rat adipocytes is mimicked by DAG and blocked by the PKC inhibitor calphostin C and a specific inhibitor of phospholipase C (S Gaur, H Yamaguchi & HM Goodman, submitted), which leads to the hypothesis that GH activates L-type calcium channels by a mechanism that involves phospholipid hydrolysis and activation of PKC. GH-induced expression of a

196 CARTER-SU, SCHWARTZ & SMIT

spi 2.1 promoter/CAT construct and the refractory effects of GH on metabolism in adipocytes (50) are blocked by verapamil (14, 96), indicating that the actions of GH may be dependent upon the GH-induced increase in \([Ca^{2+}]_i\). Further evidence that refractoriness to the insulin-like effect of GH requires increased \([Ca^{2+}]_i\) and calmodulin is provided by the findings that (a) inhibition of calmodulin with calmidazolium or trifluoroprazine, or depletion of cellular calcium by incubation in calcium-free medium, reverses refractoriness to the insulin-like effects of GH in rat adipocytes; (b) incubation of GH-responsive cells with the calcium ionophore A23187 in the presence of normal extracellular calcium concentrations causes the cells to become refractory; and (c) \([Ca^{2+}]_i\) is twice as high in refractory cells as in sensitive cells (97). Mutagenesis studies in CHO cells suggest that GH-dependent increases in \([Ca^{2+}]_i\) require the C-terminal half of GHR but may not require the prolines in Box 1 (14), thus raising the possibility that calcium signaling may be independent of JAK2 activation.

# GH-REGULATED EVENTS IN THE NUCLEUS

Many of the signaling events and phosphorylation cascades described above culminate in GH-regulated changes in the expression of genes in target cells. Recent evidence indicates that GH regulates activity of transcription factors as well as tissue-specific genes likely to mediate its long-term physiological actions.

## Activation of Stat Family Proteins by GH

A recently described family of transcription factors that serve as signal transducers and activators of transcription (Stat) participates in GH signaling between the receptor and the nucleus. Originally identified in IFN-signaling pathways (27), Stat proteins are latent cytoplasmic factors containing SH2 and SH3 domains. Upon tyrosyl phosphorylation, often via a JAK kinase-initiated cascade, cytoplasmic Stat proteins complex with other Stat and/or non-Stat proteins, translocate to the nucleus, bind to DNA, and activate transcription of target genes. GH has been shown to induce tyrosyl phosphorylation of several Stat (or Stat-related) proteins. Stat1/p91 originally identified in IFN signaling; Stat3/APRF (acute-phase response factor) involved in IL-6 and LIF signaling; and/or Stat5/MGF (mammary gland factor) involved in Prl signaling are tyrosyl phosphorylated in GH-treated 3T3-F442A fibroblasts, in liver hypophysectomized rats treated with GH and in GH-treated CHO cells expressing recombinant GHR (17, 54, 55, 77; Y Han, DW Leaman, F Gouilleux, B Bronner IM Kerr, WI Wood, GR Stark, submitted; LS Smit, DJ Meyer, N Billestrup, G Norstedt, J Schwartz, C Carter-Su, submitted; GS Campbell &

C Carter-Su, unpublished observations). Consistent with their role as transcription factors, Stat proteins are present in GH-induced DNA-binding complexes for several genes. In the *c-fos* promoter, GH induces the binding of three complexes to the Sis-inducible element (SIE) (17, 55, 77). Because Stat1 can form homodimers through SH2-phosphotyrosine interactions (100), the three GH-induced SIE-binding complexes are thought to contain Stat1 and Stat3 homodimers and Stat1 and Stat3 heterodimers, respectively. In Ba/F3 cells transfected with GHR, GH induces binding of Stat1-containing complexes to the SIE and the IFNγ-response region (GRR) (132). GH also stimulates the binding of Stat5 to the IFNγ-activated sequence (GAS)-like response element (GLE-1) in the *spi 2.1* gene (137) and of binding an unknown Stat-related protein to GRR in IM-9 cells (39). Stat4 may be a minor component in SIE-binding complexes in liver (55). Activation of Stats by GH appears to be cell-type dependent because GH was not observed to activate Stat1 in IM-9 cells (39, 102). GH-stimulated Stat3 activation occurs in the absence of Stat1 activation, indicating that Stats can be activated by GH independently of each other (LS Smit, DJ Meyer, N Billestrup, G Norstedt, J Schwartz & C Carter-Su, submitted; Y Han, DW Leaman, F Gouilleux, B Groner, IM Kerr, WI Wood & GR Stark, submitted). DNA binding of Stat-containing complexes may represent an important contribution to induction of gene expression by GH and suggests a direct pathway (GHR → JAK → Stats → target gene) by which GH can elicit nuclear events. Activation of Stat proteins is also observed upon ligand binding to many members of the cytokine receptor superfamily (27), suggesting that activation of Stat proteins is a common mechanism by which cytokines and growth factors regulate transcription.

Analysis of GH signaling in a JAK2-deficient cell line and truncated and mutated GHRs indicates that Stat activation requires JAK2 activation (132; LS Smit, DJ Meyer, N Billestrup, G Norstedt, J Schwartz & C Carter-Su, submitted; Y Han, DW Leaman, F Gouilleux, B Groner, IM Kerr, WI Wood & GR Stark, submitted). However, no specific phosphorylated tyrosines in GHR appear to be required for activation of Stats 1 or 3 by GH (131a; LS Smit, DJ Meyer, N Billestrup, G Norstedt, J Schwartz & C Carter-Su, submitted), and GHR does not contain the Stat3- (YXXQ) or Stat1-association motifs found in gp130 and IFNγ-containing receptors, respectively (53, 114). In contrast, JAK2 contains motifs identical or similar to these Stat-association motifs. These findings suggest that in the case of GH, where JAK2 phosphorylation is substantial and no regions of GHR are directly implicated in Stat activation, Stats 1 and 3 may bind primarily to JAK2 or to proteins that bind JAK2. For other cytokines that activate JAK kinases to a lesser extent than GH but activate Stat proteins to a similar or greater extent, Stat1 and/or Stat3 activation may be augmented by high-affinity Stat-binding sites in the receptors themselves. Alternatively, a region of GHR not involving a phosphorylated tyrosine may

be involved in Stat activation, or GH may utilize an intermediary protein in  
this activation. Other cytokines may employ the same accessory protein, a  
different protein, or no additional proteins to activate Stat proteins.  

**Induction of Early-Response Genes by GH**  

GH rapidly induces the expression of early-response genes, including *c-fos*  
and *c-jun* (36, 56, 107), that encode transcription factors implicated in cell  
growth and differentiation and that may regulate genes involved in long-term  
responses to GH. For example, in 3T3-F442A adipocytes, binding of Fos-containing DNA-binding complexes is required for expression of the adipocyte-specific gene aP2 (111), which suggests that Fos contributes to GH-dependent cell differentiation by regulating the expression of tissue-specific genes. The binding of CAAT/enhancer binding proteins (C/EBP) β and γ, transcription factors implicated in adipocyte differentiation, is also stimulated by GH in 3T3-F442A cells, each isoform apparently stimulated by a different mechanism (21). GH also rapidly induces the expression of *c-myc* (83), which encodes a transcription factor involved in cell proliferation.  

Analysis of the regulation by GH of early-response genes has provided insight into signaling between GHR and the nucleus. In the *c-fos* gene, upstream regulatory sequences include the serum response element (SRE), which binds serum response factor (SRF) and TCFs (126). The SRE has been found to mediate induction of *c-fos* by GH (78). A rapid and transient induction by GH of binding of SRF-containing complexes to the SRE (73) may be related to such mediation. MAP kinases, activated by GH and a number of other growth factors (3, 18, 81, 134), are reported to phosphorylate SRF via p90<sup>rsk</sup> (92) and TCFs, in the latter case stimulating transcriptional activity (46, 65, 75). These observations suggest a pathway involving GHR → MAP kinase → SRE-associated proteins → Fos by which GH stimulation is likely to result in nuclear events contributing to the ability of GH to promote cell growth and differentiation. The relationship(s), if any, between the pathways from the GHR to the SRE and the Stat-mediated pathway to the SIE remain to be determined.  

**Genes Related to Long-Term Actions of GH**  

Many physiological actions of GH require long-term exposure to the hormone  
(hours to days), presumably reflecting effects of GH on expression of genes  
that are mediated by the rapid signaling events and regulation of transcription  
factors discussed above. Among its targets, GH regulates adipocyte differentiation and an array of metabolic responses in adipocytes (30, 52). Adipocyte  
differentiation appears to reflect regulation by GH of several genes known to  
be expressed as adipocytes differentiate (10, 112), including those encoding  

glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase (GPD), a lipogenic enzyme; aP2/422, a lipid-binding protein; and lipoprotein lipase (LPL) (35, 89). Fos is reported to participate in regulation of aP2 and LPL (6, 33), which suggests the sequence GH → Fos → adipocyte-specific genes → adipocyte differentiation. Some long-term metabolic events regulated by GH also reflect regulation of expression of genes. For example, chronic inhibition by GH of glucose transport in adipocytes (95) is due, at least in part, to decreased expression of the Glut 1 glucose transporter (118).

GH-regulated genes in the liver include the gene encoding insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), a serum mediator of some actions of GH (29, 63). IGF-1 gene expression is stimulated by GH in liver by predominantly transcriptional mechanisms (11, 76), although the mechanisms have proven difficult to delineate. The kinetics of induction by GH of a DNase hypersensitive site in the second intron of the IGF-1 gene parallels the pattern of stimulation of IGF-1 transcription by GH (11), suggesting that the hypersensitive site is involved in induction of IGF-1 by GH. Protein-binding sites have been identified in the IGF-1 promoter, but none appear to be affected by GH treatment (121, 122). More recent work indicates that other tissues including adipocytes and chondrocytes increase IGF-1 mRNA expression in response to GH (34, 64, 88, 130), suggesting that local IGF-1 contributes to some GH responses. IGF-1 has a high affinity for a family of IGF-binding proteins (IGF-BPs) (94), which can modulate its biological actions. Regulation by GH of genes encoding IGF-BPs (37, 99) adds another level of complexity to the relationship between GH and IGF-1.

Several other GH-regulated genes in the liver have provided important insights into GH signaling. The *spi* 2.1 gene, encoding a liver-specific serine protease inhibitor, is stimulated by GH in vivo and in vitro (70, 139). The stimulation by GH is mediated via a 45-bp GH-response sequence (139) containing GAS-like elements, which binds proteins induced by GH (106, 122). The complex has recently been found to contain the transcription factor Stat5 (137). Similar sequences are also present in the GH-regulated somatostatin gene (12). The proline-rich region of GHR was shown to be important for GH-dependent activation of *spi* 2.1 (51), implying that JAK2 is required for GH-induced *spi* 2.1 expression. Interestingly, tyrosines 534 and 566 in the C-terminal half of the cytoplasmic domain of GHR are required for stimulation via the *spi* 2.1 promoter (X Wang, CJ Darus, N Billestrup & JJ Kopchick, submitted), whereas stimulation of *c-fos* requires only the N-terminal half of GHR (49). These observations suggest that there are multiple mechanisms for regulation of gene expression via GHR.

Hepatic expression of genes encoding cytochrome P450 enzymes involved in steroid metabolism, which are either male or female specific, is strongly influenced by sex differences in the pattern of GH secretion (71). Regulation

in vitro of expression of several P450 2C genes by a complex interplay of GH, IGF-1, and thyroid hormones and involving a permissive effect of protein kinase C led to the suggestion that more than one signal transduction mechanism mediates regulation of hepatic genes by GH (124, 125). Taken together, it is clear that regulation of a variety of genes by multiple mechanisms underlies multiple responses to GH in various target tissues.

# CONCLUDING REMARKS

Work carried out largely since 1991 has given us significant insight into the molecular mechanisms by which binding of GH to its receptor elicits the diverse effects of GH. GH has been shown to bind sequentially to two GHBP, leading to the hypothesis that GH binding causes both dimerization of GHR and conformational changes important for GH function. These changes result in increased binding to GHR of JAK2, a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase, and promote activation of JAK2. Other JAK kinases may also be activated, although probably to a lesser extent. In turn, both GHR and JAK2 are phosphorylated on tyrosines, presumably by the activated JAK2. These phosphorylated tyrosines serve as docking sites for SH2 domain-containing signaling molecules. Subsequent signaling events include activation of MAP kinases, presumably via a SHC → Grb2 → Sos → ras → raf → MEK pathway; tyrosyl phosphorylation of IRS-1 and IRS-2; association of IRS-1 with PI 3′ kinase; activation of PI 3′ kinase; activation of a phospholipase with subsequent formation of DAG and activation of PKC; increases in intracellular calcium concentration, most likely as a result of increased L-type Ca channels; and activation of the latent transcription factors Stats 1, 3, and 5. The activation of MAP kinases, which are known to phosphorylate transcription factors, and Stats is likely to play a role in the GH-dependent induction of transcription of c-fos, an event thought to be important for GH-induced cellular differentiation. GH stimulates transcription of a number of other genes, including *spi* 2.1 and somatostatin. Analysis of the regions of GHR required for activation of these signaling molecules indicates that JAK2 is required for activation of SHC, Grb2, MAP kinases, IRS-1 and -2, and PI-3 kinase, and Stats 1 and 3. Direct interactions of SHC, IRS-1 and -2, and Stats 1 and 3 with GHR have not been demonstrated, which suggests that these signaling molecules might bind to phosphorylated tyrosyl residues in JAK2 itself or to as yet unidentified accessory molecules. In contrast, regions of GHR other than those required for GH-dependent activation of JAK2 are required for GH-induced increases in intracellular calcium concentrations and GH-stimulated expression of the *spi* 2.1 and somatostatin genes. Thus the findings described here suggest that signaling mechanisms initiated by binding of GH to GHR are complex. Identification of which pathways elicit which responses, how the different signaling

cascades intersect, further characterization of the role of GHR in initiating these pathways, and the identification of new pathways promise to be fascinating challenges that should provide a greater understanding of how GH elicits its diverse effects on body growth and metabolism.
