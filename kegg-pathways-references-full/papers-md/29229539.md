## ABSTRACT

Bisphenol A (BPA; 4,4′-isopropylidenediphenol) is an endocrine disruptor that is used as a material for the production of phenol resins, polyacrylates, polyesters, epoxy resins, and polycarbonate plastics. Endocrine-disruptive or toxic effects of BPA on living organisms through a number of cell signaling pathways have been reported. BPA induces carcinogenesis, reproductive toxicity, abnormal inflammatory or immune response, and developmental disorders of brain or nervous system through various cell signaling pathways. This review considers the literature concerning BPA and its association with cancer-related cell signaling pathways, reproductive toxicity-related cell signaling pathways, inflammatory or immune response-related cell signaling pathways, and brain and nervous system-related cell signaling pathways.

### 1. Introduction

Bisphenol A (BPA; 4,4′-isopropylidenediphenol; CAS registry no. 80-05-7) is an organic compound composed of two phenol rings connected by a methyl bridge, with two methyl functional groups attached to the bridge (Fig. 1a). BPA is used as a material for the production of phenol resins, polyacrylates and polyesters, and principally for the production of epoxy resins and polycarbonate plastics ([Kang et al., 2006b](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2006.01.019); [Staples et al., 1998](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0045-6535(98)00003-5)).

BPA is an endocrine disruptor. In some cases, its derivatives show higher toxicity or estrogenic potency than BPA itself. The estrogenic activity of a chlorinated derivative, 3,3′-dichlorobisphenol A (3,3′-diClBPA) (Fig. 1a), is higher than that of BPA ([Tabata et al., 2004](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yrtph.2004.04.003); [Takemura et al., 2005](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2005.01.004)). Tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) (Fig. 1b) and 3,3′,5,5′-tetrachlorobisphenol A (3,3′,5,5′-tetraClBPA) (Fig. 1a) are more toxic than BPA ([Kang et al., 2007](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2006.11.026); [McCormick et al., 2010](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2010.01.045); [Nakagawa et al., 2007](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2006.11.027)).

BPA is detected in the water, air, and soil. For example, BPA is discharged into aquatic environments from the migration of BPA-based products into rivers and marine waters, and in the effluent from wastewater treatment plants and landfill sites ([Kang et al., 2007](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2006.11.026)). The environment can be one source of human BPA exposure, but the primary route of human exposure is foods ([Kang et al., 2006b](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2006.01.019)). Among foods, relatively high levels of BPA are detected in canned foods and its maximum concentration is 842 ng/g ([Cao et al., 2010](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2009.12.036); [Chen et al., 2016](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2015.10.018); [Kang et al., 2006b](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2006.01.019); [Noonan et al., 2011](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2010.10.018); [Sajiki et al., 2007](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2006.11.028); [Vandenberg et al., 2007a](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2006.11.029)). After ingestion, BPA is rapidly metabolized to several inactive metabolites, such as BPA-glucuronide and BPA-sulfate. Free BPA is excreted mainly in feces (56–82%) and its metabolites are in urine (13–28%) ([Kang et al., 2006a,b](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2006.01.019); [Vandenberg et al., 2007a](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2006.11.029)). In spite of rapid metabolism, free BPA is observed in the urine of adults and children (non-creatinine-adjusted concentration; < 0.1–822 ng/ml) ([Calafat et al., 2008](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2007.09.008); [Covaci et al., 2015](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2015.01.018); [Zhang et al., 2011](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2010.11.008)), as well as in the serum of pregnant women (< 0.1–154 ng/ml) ([Schönfelder et al., 2002](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0026-0495(02)00065-8); [Teeguarden et al., 2016](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2015.11.018); [Unal et al., 2012](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2012.01.018)), umbilical cord serum (< 0.05–52 ng/ml) ([Gerona et al., 2013](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2012.11.018); [Schönfelder et al., 2002](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0026-0495(02)00065-8); [Unal et al., 2012](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2012.01.018)), and breast milk (< 0.04–11 ng/ml) ([Cao et al., 2015](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2015.01.018); [Hines et al., 2015](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2015.01.018); [Zimmers et al., 2014](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2014.01.018)). In particular, the existence of free BPA in maternal and fetal serum and breast milk may result in long-term exposure to BPA during the fetal and neonatal period, and long-term harmful effects on the fetus and neonate.

The estimated daily intake of BPA by humans ranges from < 1 to 5 μg/kg body weight (BW)/day ([Chen et al., 2016](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2015.10.018); [Kang et al., 2006b](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2006.01.019); [Thomson et al., 2003](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0026-0495(02)00065-8); [Vandenberg et al., 2007a](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2006.11.029)). It is very difficult to precisely estimate whether these levels of BPA can cause endocrine-disruptive or toxic effects in humans. However, several studies have reported adverse endocrine disruptive or toxic effects of BPA in animal models in the range of < 1 μg/kg BW/day (for review see refs. [Vandenberg et al., 2012, 2013](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2012.01.018)). For example, BPA exposure at doses as low as 0.025–0.25 μg/kg BW/day caused adverse effects, such as decreased daily sperm production and fertility in males exposed to 0.2 μg/kg BW/day ([vom Saal et al., 1998](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0026-0495(98)00003-5); [Chitra et al., 2003](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0026-0495(02)00065-8)), altered development of mammary glands in female offspring ([Muñoz-de-Toro et al., 2005](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2005.01.004)) and fetuses ([Vandenberg et al., 2007b](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2006.11.029)) prenatally exposed to

Several cell signaling pathways are involved in endocrine-disruptive or toxic effects of BPA. BPA affects carcinogenesis, reproductive toxicity, inflammatory or immune response, and the brain and nervous system through various cell signaling pathways.

This review considers the literature concerning BPA and cancer-related cell signaling pathways, BPA and reproductive toxicity-relative cell signaling pathways, BPA and inflammatory or immune response-related cell signaling pathways, and BPA and brain and nervous system-related cell signaling pathways.

## 2. BPA and cancer-related cell signaling pathways

BPA is involved in the regulation of cancer cell growth, survival, proliferation, migration, invasion, and apoptosis, and anticancer drug resistance through several signaling pathways (Fig. 2). These regulations are activated by the binding of BPA to nuclear and membrane receptors, or by BPA-mediated stimulation of these receptors. These receptors include estrogen receptor α/β (ERα/β) (Dong et al., 2011; Hwang et al., 2013b; Kang et al., 2013; Park et al., 2009), androgen receptor (AR) (Wetherill et al., 2005), G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER; also known as G protein-coupled receptor 30, GPR30) (Dong et al., 2011; Pupo et al., 2012), insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) (Hwang et al., 2013b; Kang et al., 2013), and estrogen-related receptor gamma (ERRγ) (Zhang et al., 2014a).

AR mutations in prostate cancer are associated with increased cancer progression and hormone therapy failure (Brooke and Bevan, 2009; Tan et al., 2015). BPA can activate functional mutant AR alleles, such as T877A, T877S, V715M, L701H, and K580R (Wetherill et al., 2005). BPA induces inappropriate AR-T877A activation and mitogenesis in prostate cancer cells (Lee et al., 2003; Wetherill et al., 2002). Activation of AR-T877A by BPA exposure (1 nM) can androgen-independently stimulate the proliferation of the androgen-dependent prostate cancer cell line LNCaP in the absence of androgen [5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT)] (Hess-Wilson et al., 2007; Lee et al., 2003; Wetherill et al., 2002, 2005, 2006), but synergistically increases cell proliferation in the presence of DHT (1 nM) (Wetherill et al., 2005). However, high concentrations of BPA (10 μM) inhibited the proliferation of AR-positive/androgen-dependent prostate cancer cells, LNCaP (AR-T877A) and LAPC-4 (wild-type AR), but failed in AR-positive/androgen-independent 22Rv-1 cells (AR-H874Y) (Wetherill et al., 2005). On the other hand, BPA treatment (1 μM) enhances DHT-mediated AR-H874Y transactivation in 22Rv-1 cells (Wetherill et al., 2005).

Furthermore, BPA acts as an agonist for ERβ and has dual actions as an agonist and antagonist for ERα (Hiroi et al., 1999; Kurosawa et al., 2002). In cancer, BPA-mediated ERα activation is involved in cancer cell growth, survival, proliferation, migration, invasion, and apoptosis, and anticancer drug resistance. However, ERβ inhibits the function of ERα (Hayashi et al., 2003; Paruthiyil et al., 2004; Shaaban et al., 2003). For example, introducing ERβ to ERα positive breast cancer cells reduces cancer cell proliferation and cancer formation in a mouse xenograft model by inducing a G₂ cell cycle arrest (Paruthiyil et al., 2004). Furthermore, ERβ expression and the ERβ/ERα ratio decrease in the following order: normal breast lobules > usual ductal hyperplasia > ductal carcinoma *in situ* > invasive cancer (Shaaban et al., 2003). BPA exposure induces ERα expression in cancer cells, whereas ERβ expression is attenuated by BPA (Bolli et al., 2010; Dairkee et al., 2013; Hess-Wilson et al., 2007).

### 2.1. BPA and cancer cell growth and proliferation

BPA can stimulate growth and proliferation of cancer cells. Addition of BPA to ER-positive ovarian and breast cancer cells induces the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (MARK/ERK1/2) (Dong et al., 2011; Park et al., 2009; Ptak and Gregoraszczuk, 2012; Song et al., 2015) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt (also known as protein kinase B)/mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K/Akt/mTOR) signaling pathways (Dairkee et al., 2013; Goodson et al., 2011; Hwang et al., 2013b; Kang et al., 2013; Ptak and Gregoraszczuk, 2012), which have key roles in cell growth and proliferation. Among the MAPK proteins, BPA-mediated activation of p38 MAPK in cancer cells has been reported in some studies (Park et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2015). However, other studies suggested no or reduced BPA-mediated activation of p38 MAPK and/or Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) (Bulzomi et al., 2012; Song et al., 2015). Furthermore, in spite of the use of the same BPA dose (10 nM) and ER-negative SkBr3 cell line, two research groups have reported different results on BPA-mediated activation of p38 MAPK. One group found increased p38 MAPK phosphorylation (Zhang et al., 2015), whereas the other reported no effect on p38 MAPK phosphorylation (Song et al., 2015).

Stimulation of cell cycle proteins including p53, cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) by BPA exposure is associated with enhanced growth and proliferation of cancer cells through ER signaling (Dairkee et al., 2013; Hwang et al., 2013b; Kang et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2012a; Mlynarcikova et al., 2013; Song et al., 2015). For example, BPA notably increases proliferation-associated cell cycle proteins, such as cyclin A, cyclin D3, CDK2, CDK6, and PCNA, but decreases negative regulators, such as p53 and p21 (also designated WAF1/Cip1), in non-cancerous human high-risk donor breast epithelial cells (HRBECs) and T47D ER-positive breast cancer cells (Dairkee et al., 2013).

Furthermore, BPA treatment promotes the expression of ERα and

Fig. 2. BPA and cancer-related cell signaling pathways. BPA increases cancer cell growth and proliferation mainly through the ERK1/2 and/or Akt signaling pathway, and cell migration and invasion through GPER-mediated signaling pathways. BPA decreases apoptosis by up-regulating pro-survival signals (e.g., PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathways) and anti-apoptotic signals (e.g., Bcl-2), and down-regulating pro-apoptotic signals (e.g., Bax and BAD).

IGF-1R, and the phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), cyclin D1, and Akt in BG-1 ovarian cancer cells and BG-1-bearing mice. IRS-1 is the main substrate of IGF-1R and can activate cyclin D1 and Akt. These results indicate that BPA-induced growth of BG-1 cells mediates the crosstalk between ER and IGF-1R ([Hwang et al., 2013b](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2013.04.018); [Kang et al., 2013](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2013.04.018)).

BPA-mediated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) activation contributes to the proliferation of ER-positive MCF-7 breast ([Zhang et al., 2012b](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tox.2012.05.009)) and OVCAR-3 ovarian cancer cells ([Ptak and Gregoraszczuk, 2012](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tox.2012.05.009)). Moreover, ER-positive BG-1 ovarian cancer cells treated with BPA show increased expression of SnoN, a transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) pathway inhibitor, and c-Fos, a TGF-β target transcription factor. Inhibition of TGF-β activation by BPA treatment reduces the phosphorylation of Smad3, a downstream target of TGF-β. In BG-1 cancer-bearing mice, BPA treatment decreases the phosphorylation of Smad3 and increases the expression of SnoN ([Park and Choi, 2014](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tox.2014.01.001)).

In ER-negative breast cancer cells (e.g., MDA-MB-231 and SkBr3), GPER plays a key role in the BPA-mediated ERK1/2 activation ([Dong et al., 2011](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tox.2011.01.001); [Pupo et al., 2012](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tox.2012.01.001)). BPA also induces the expression of G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) target genes, such as c-Fos, EGR-1, and CTGF, and their protein levels through the GPER/epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)/ERK1/2 signaling pathway ([Pupo et al., 2012](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tox.2012.01.001)). The activation of GPER/EGFR/ERK1/2 signaling by BPA exposure promotes the proliferation of ERα/β-negative breast cancer cells ([Dong et al., 2011](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tox.2011.01.001); [Pupo et al., 2012](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tox.2012.01.001)).

In addition to ER and GPER, BPA can bind at high affinity to ERRγ, a member of the orphan nuclear receptor family ([Okada et al., 2008](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tox.2008.01.001)). A recent study suggested that the up-regulation of ERRγ, but not GPER and ERα/β, is important in BPA-mediated proliferation of breast cancer cells. ERK1/2 participates in the BPA-induced up-regulation of ERRγ, as evident by the significantly reduced up-regulation of ERRγ and proliferation of breast cancer cells in the presence of ERK1/2 inhibitor ([Song et al., 2015](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tox.2015.01.001)).

While ERK1/2 and/or Akt signaling pathways may play a central role in BPA-mediated growth and proliferation of cancer cells, there are exceptions. For example, BPA-induced cell proliferation of JKT-1

seminoma cells requires cyclic adenosine monophosphate-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and cyclic guanosine monophosphate-dependent protein kinase (PKG), but does not require ERK1/2 ([Bouskine et al., 2009](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tox.2009.01.001)).

### 2.2. BPA and cancer cell migration and invasion

BPA-induced migration and invasion of cancer cells have been identified from several types of cancer cells including ovarian cancer cells (BG-1 and OVCAR-3) ([Kim et al., 2015](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tox.2015.01.001); [Ptak et al., 2014](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tox.2014.01.001)), SW480 colorectal cancer cells ([Chen et al., 2015](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tox.2015.01.001)), A549 lung cancer cells ([Zhang et al., 2014a](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tox.2014.01.001)), cervical cancer cells (HeLa, SiHa and C-33A) ([Ma et al., 2015](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tox.2015.01.001)), ER-negative SkBr3 ([Zhang et al., 2015](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tox.2015.01.001)) and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells ([Castillo Sanchez et al., 2016](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tox.2016.01.001)), and RL95-2 endometrial cancer cells ([Wang et al., 2015b](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tox.2015.01.001)).

Migration and invasion of cancer cells after BPA treatment are stimulated by enhanced activation of proteases like metalloproteinases (MMPs) ([Kim et al., 2015](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tox.2015.01.001); [Ma et al., 2015](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tox.2015.01.001); [Ptak et al., 2014](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tox.2014.01.001); [Zhang et al., 2014a](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tox.2014.01.001)), the loss of epithelial cell junctional proteins including E-cadherin ([Chen et al., 2015](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tox.2015.01.001); [Kim et al., 2015](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tox.2015.01.001); [Zhang et al., 2015](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tox.2015.01.001)), and an increase in mesenchymal markers, such as N-cadherin ([Chen et al., 2015](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tox.2015.01.001); [Ptak et al., 2014](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tox.2014.01.001)), fibronectin ([Chen et al., 2015](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tox.2015.01.001); [Ma et al., 2015](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tox.2015.01.001)), and vimentin ([Chen et al., 2015](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tox.2015.01.001); [Kim et al., 2015](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tox.2015.01.001)).

The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a physiological process that is critical in promoting metastasis of cancer cells through the loss of cell-cell adhesion and cell-matrix adhesion. EMT mechanisms are closely related to the down-regulation or loss of E-cadherin, a key mediator of the EMT process ([Jiang et al., 2015](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tox.2015.01.001); [Kalluri and Weinberg, 2009](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tox.2009.01.001)). With increased expression of N-cadherin, the induction of EMT following BPA treatment enhances the metastasis of SW480 colorectal cancer cells. Akt/glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β)-mediated stabilization of the transcription factor Snail is associated with BPA-induced EMT of SW480 cells ([Chen et al., 2015](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tox.2015.01.001)). BPA-mediated down-regulation of a forkhead family transcription factor, forkhead box A1 (FOXA1, also known as hepatocyte nuclear factor 3α), also promotes the EMT of ER-negative SkBr3 breast cancer cells. The PI3K/Akt signaling pathway is involved in the BPA-mediated down-regulation of

FOXA1, as evidenced by the significantly reduced BPA-induced FOXA1 down-regulation in the presence of the inhibitor LY294002 (Zhang et al., 2015).

As mentioned earlier, the inhibition of TGF-β signaling pathway by BPA treatment stimulates the growth of cancer cells (Park and Choi, 2014). In addition to cell growth, BPA-mediated inhibition of TGF-β signaling pathway through decreased phosphorylation of Smad3 and enhanced expression of SnoN is also involved in the induction of EMT and migration of BG-1 ovarian cancer cells (Kim et al., 2015). Furthermore, up-regulation of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) by BPA treatment induces EMT, resulting in increased migration and invasion of RL95-2 endometrial cancer cells (Wang et al., 2015b).

Accumulating data suggest that the GPER-mediated signaling pathway is closely related to migration and invasion of cancer cells following BPA treatment. BPA up-regulates MMP-2 and -9 through GPER, not ER, and also induces the activation of ERK1/2 through GPER/EGFR in A549 lung cancer cells. These results indicate that BPA triggers the migration and invasion of A549 cells by activating MMPs and the GPER/EGFR/ERK1/2 signaling pathways (Zhang et al., 2014a). Moreover, BPA-induced migration of ER-negative MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells through the GPER signaling pathway depends on the activation of FAK, Src, and ERK2, and a subsequent increase in activator protein-1 (AP-1)/nuclear factor κ-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB)-DNA binding activity (Castillo Sanchez et al., 2016).

BPA-induced cell migration is significantly reduced in OVCAR-3 ovarian cancer cells treated with inhibitors of MAPK and PI3K pathways. This indicates that the activation of the MAPK and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways may be important in the migration of OVCAR-3 cells (Ptak et al., 2014). In addition, enhanced expression of MMP-9 and fibronectin has been demonstrated in HeLa and SiHa cervical cancer cells exposed to BPA, while the expression of MMP-2, N-cadherin, and vimentin are not changed. However, inhibitors of ERK1/2, EGFR, and PI3K/Akt have no effect on the expression of MMP-9 and fibronectin. With activation of MMP-9 and fibronectin, therefore, the activation of IkB kinase-β/NF-κB signals may be essential for the BPA-mediated migration of cervical cancer cells (Ma et al., 2015).

### 2.3. BPA and cancer cell apoptosis and drug resistance

Apoptosis is a physiological process for programmed cell death occurring as a homeostatic mechanism to maintain cell populations in tissues and as a defense mechanism triggered cell damages or immune reactions (Elmore, 2007). Defective or inefficient apoptosis is associated with the development and progression of cancer and drug resistance (Indran et al., 2011; Johnstone et al., 2002).

BPA treatment notably up-regulates anti-apoptotic proteins including B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) and Bcl-xL (Delgado and Ribeiro-Varandas, 2015; LaPensee et al., 2009, 2010; Ptak et al., 2011; Song et al., 2015), and down-regulates pro-apoptotic proteins like p53, Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax), and Bim (Dairkee et al., 2013; Mlynarcikova et al., 2013; Ptak et al., 2011). For example, BPA exposure decreases the expression of pro-apoptotic p53 and simultaneously reduces its downstream pro-apoptotic Bax in both HRBECs and T47D ER-positive breast cancer cells, which inhibits apoptotic cell death (Dairkee et al., 2013). BPA also reduces the activity of caspase-3, -7, and -9, which are important inducers of apoptosis (Ptak et al., 2011).

In addition to the anti-apoptotic effects of BPA, the activation of pro-survival signaling pathways, such as PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathways, is associated with BPA-mediated resistance to anti-cancer drugs (Dairkee et al., 2013; Goodson III et al., 2011). Cancer cells exposed to BPA exhibit resistance to anti-cancer drugs like doxorubicin (Delgado and Ribeiro-Varandas, 2015; LaPensee et al., 2009) and cisplatin (LaPensee et al., 2010). The resistance to anti-cancer drugs triggered by BPA may appear to be independent of ERα/β because it protects ERα/β-negative breast cancer cells against the drugs (LaPensee et al., 2010).

Furthermore, toxic and apoptotic effects of BPA have been reported in NB4 and HL60 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells (Bontempo et al., 2009; Terasaka et al., 2005). Several signals include BPA-mediated toxicity and apoptosis of AML cells, such as enhanced activation of caspases, pro-apoptotic proteins (e.g., Bcl-2-associated death promoter, which is a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family), and death pathways modulating both Fas and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand, and decreased activation of ERK1/2 and Akt (Bontempo et al., 2009; Terasaka et al., 2005).

The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family plays a central role in multidrug resistance (MDR) through an ATP-dependent drug efflux pump. Among the ABC transporter proteins, P-glycoprotein encoded by *MDR1* (as known as *ABCB1*), multidrug resistance-associated proteins (MRP), and breast cancer resistance proteins (BCRP) are involved in MDR of cancer cells. ABC transporter protein-mediated MDR is one of the most serious problems facing cancer treatment (Callaghan et al., 2014; Fletcher et al., 2010; Kang, 2014). ABC transporter proteins are important in the metabolism and excretion of BPA (Mazur et al., 2012; Moscovitz et al., 2016). BPA exposure increases the BCRP and MRP ABC transporter proteins in hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells and human fetal liver tissues (Hanet et al., 2008; Moscovitz et al., 2016). However, despite several reports on the BPA-induced resistance to anti-cancer drugs (Delgado and Ribeiro-Varandas, 2015; LaPensee et al., 2009, 2010), there are no data concerning the correlation between BPA and ABC transporter protein-mediated MDR in cancer cells.

Taken together, the data indicate that BPA promotes anti-apoptotic activation as well as drug resistance in many cancer cells, except AML cells, by enhancing anti-apoptotic proteins and decreasing pro-apoptotic proteins. Furthermore, BPA-induced resistance to anti-cancer drugs is caused largely by decreased apoptosis and increased activity of cell survival signaling pathways.

### 2.4. BPA and carcinogenesis

Mammary glands obtained from 8-week-old female rats gavaged daily with 5 mg/kg BPA for 8 weeks reportedly displayed increases in the number and size of the acini and ducts, as well as the collagen fiber content in the connective stroma. Despite the increased activity of caspase-3 in epithelial cells, the administration of BPA was shown to increase the proliferation of epithelial cells, as confirmed by staining with the proliferation marker Ki-67 (Ibrahim et al., 2016). Hyperplasia of epithelial cells in the mammary gland is linked to a higher risk of breast cancer (Dairkee et al., 2013; Guray and Sahin, 2006; Murray et al., 2007; Shaaban et al., 2002). As an example, fetal exposure to BPA (female Wistar-Furth rats; 250–1000 μg/kg BW/day) from embryonic day (E) 9 until postnatal day (PND) 1 promoted the number of Ki-67-positive epithelial cells in ductal hyperplasia and the development of intraductal carcinoma *in situ* at PND 50 and 95 (Murray et al., 2007).

The susceptibility of mammary glands for chemically-induced carcinogenesis is influenced by the age of rats at the time of carcinogen administration. In female rats, highly proliferative terminal end buds in the mammary glands increase in early puberty between PND 40–60. These terminal end buds show high sensitivity to carcinogenic agents because their proliferative activities are associated with increased levels of DNA adduct formation and reduced capacity to repair DNA damage (Hilakivi-Clarke, 2007; Russo and Russo, 1996; Stanko et al., 2016). Therefore, the glands in female rats before and after PND 50 are routinely used for chemically induced mammary carcinogenesis, with no effect on apoptosis in the terminal end buds (Kubatka et al., 2002; Russo and Russo, 1996; Welsch, 1985).

Prepubertal BPA treatment increases cell proliferation of terminal end buds in adult rat mammary glands at PND 50. Decreased pro-apoptotic and anti-proliferative signals, such as caspase-3, poly ADP ribose polymerase, p21, and phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), and increased proliferative signals like Akt have been described in mammary glands of PND 50 rats (Wang et al., 2014a). Furthermore, neonatal and prepubertal exposure to BPA for PND 2–20 via lactation

from nursing dams treated orally with BPA increases the activation of progesterone receptor A (PR-A), steroid receptor coactivator (SRC) 1–3, receptor tyrosine-protein kinase erbB3 (also known as HER3), and Akt after the administration of the carcinogen dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA) at 30 mg/kg BW at PND 50 (Jenkins et al., 2009).

Prenatal exposure to BPA can increase the susceptibility to chemically-induced mammary carcinogenesis. For instance, female offspring of rats exposed to BPA from days 10 to 21 after conception reportedly exhibit increased activation of Akt, c-Raf (also known as Raf-1), and ERK1/2 in mammary glands at PND 50. These cellular signals may be closely related to increased risk of cancer in mammary glands (Betancourt et al., 2010b). Moreover, the administration of DMBA (30 mg/kg BW) to female offspring of pregnant Sprague Dawley rats treated with BPA (250 μg/kg BW) from gestation day (GD) 10 to 21, significantly increased the risk of chemically-induced mammary carcinogenesis. However, the signaling pathways differ between PND 50 and 100. At PND 50, the down-regulation of ERα, PR-A, and Bcl-2, and the up-regulation of SRCs 1–3 have been reported in the mammary glands of rats prenatally exposed to BPA. On the other hand, ERα, Bcl-2, and SRCs 1–3 are up-regulated at PND 100. These data suggest that prenatal exposure to BPA shifts the time of susceptibility from PND 50 to PND 100 for DMBA-induced mammary carcinogenesis (Betancourt et al., 2010a).

The Akt and ERK signaling pathways are simulated in prostate stem-progenitor cells within the prostaspheres following BPA exposure. This indicates that prostate stem-progenitor cells can be a target of BPA. In the renal mouse model of chimeric human-rat prostate tissues grafted with human prostate stem-progenitor cells combined with rat mesenchyme, BPA treatment significantly induces the incidence of high-grade prostate intraepithelial neoplasia and adenocarcinoma (Prins et al., 2014).

The GPER/EGFR/ERK signaling pathways may be involved in the BPA-mediated initiation and progression of male germ cell carcinogenesis. For example, in the case of spermatogonial GC-1 cells that correspond to a stage between type B spermatogonia and primary spermatocytes (Hofmann et al., 1992), BPA exposure activates the PKG, ERα, and EGFR/ERK/c-Fos pathways through increased expression of GPER, resulting in enhanced GC-1 cell proliferation (Sheng and Zhu, 2011; Sheng et al., 2013).

The alteration of ERα:ERβ ratio may pose a high risk of cancer progression. In fact, the levels of ERβ expression are increased in the following order: normal breast lobules > usual ductal hyperplasia > ductal carcinoma in situ > invasive cancer. However, the levels of ERα are opposite (Shaaban et al., 2003). BPA exposure increases ERα expression, but decreases ERβ expression in both HRBEC lines and T47D breast cancer cells (Dairkee et al., 2013).

The mutations of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 cancer suppressor genes are related to an increased risk for cancers that include such as breast and ovarian cancer (Antoniou et al., 2003; King et al., 2003). Human breast epithelial cells exposed to BPA display an increased expression of genes involved in DNA repair (e.g., BRCA1, BRCA2, BARD1, CtIP, RAD51, and BRCC3) and genes related to cell growth (e.g., EGFR, PTG2, and IGFBP2), and a reduction of genes involved in apoptosis (e.g., PDCD5 and BCL2L11) (Fernandez et al., 2012; Qin et al., 2012). These results may mean that BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations in breast tissues can increase the susceptibility for BPA. In fact, BPA can induce cell proliferation and ERα signaling in MCF-7 breast cells treated with small interfering RNA (siRNA) against BRCA1. Furthermore, BPA administration promotes mammary gland epithelial cell proliferation in BRCA1 knockout mice (Jones et al., 2010).

The accumulating data suggest that the activation of pro-proliferative (e.g., Akt, c-Raf, and ERK1/2) and anti-apoptotic genes and proteins (e.g., Bcl-2) is essential for BPA-mediated carcinogenesis.

3. BPA and reproductive toxicity-related cell signaling pathways

BPA can regulate the formation of mammary gland (Vandenberg et al., 2007b; Wadia et al., 2013), oocyte maturation (Chao et al., 2012), and follicle development in females (Ganesan and Keating, 2016; Zhao et al., 2014). BPA can transfer across the placenta and BPA exposure through placenta can affect fetal health. One adverse fetal health consequence is decreased birth weight centile (Troisi et al., 2014). BPA accumulation in the placenta also positive correlates with preeclampsia (Leclerc et al., 2014). BPA has harmful effects on spermatogenesis and sperm quality in males (Fang et al., 2015b; Li et al., 2016a; Liu et al., 2013a; Qiu et al., 2013).

3.1. BPA and female reproductive toxicity-related cell signaling pathways

3.1.1. BPA and mammary gland

BPA exposure can increase the abnormal formation of the mammary gland in the fetus. Delayed lumen formation of the mammary gland is associated with the decreased expression of pro-apoptotic proteins like Bax and increased activity of anti-apoptotic genes like *Birc2* and *Abl1* in the epithelium of BPA-exposed female fetuses of CD-1 mice. A significant decrease in Bax-positive cells is observed in the inner cord cells rather than the outer cord cells of the epithelium. This may mean that lumen formation depends on cell death in the inner cord cells (Vandenberg et al., 2007b; Wadia et al., 2013).

Furthermore, BPA (1 nM) increases ductal growth in the CD-1 mouse mammary gland dissected at E14 through nuclear ERs, while 1 μM BPA decreases ductal growth (Speroni et al., 2017). In one study, female Wistar rats (F0) were exposed to BPA (50 μg/kg BW/day) from GD 9 to lactation day (LD) 21 supplied in the drinking water. F1 females (PND 90) born to BPA-treated female rats were bred to unexposed males. The F1 females displayed decreased milk yield at LD 13 and reduced mammary gland differentiation on GD 21. Expression of α-lactalbumin and β-casein mRNA was reduced in BPA-treated F1 females on GD 18 and was positively correlated with a reduction of prolactin receptor and its downstream transcription factor STAT5a/b expression (Kass et al., 2012).

3.1.2. BPA and folliculogenesis and oogenesis

BPA can disrupt female reproductive processes by inhibiting DNA methylation. As an example, neonatal exposure of CD-1 mice to BPA (40 μg/kg) from PND 7–14 inhibits DNA methylation of the imprinted genes, *Igf2r* and *Peg3*, and reduces the DNA methylation transferases (DNMTs), *Dnmt1, 3a, 3b,* and *3l*, during oogenesis through enhanced ER signaling pathways. BPA exposure also can inhibit oocyte maturation through an increase in the abnormal ratio of spindle assembly in meiosis I (Chao et al., 2012). Furthermore, BPA inhibits DNA demethylation of CpG sites of the *Lhx8* gene in oocytes, a process normally associated with folliculogenesis, resulting in a reduction of *Lhx8* expression (Zhang et al., 2014c).

The development of ovarian follicles can be initiated from primordial follicles. The activated primordial follicles develop into primary, secondary, antral, and preovulatory follicles (Kim, 2012; McGee and Hsueh, 2000). Most antral follicles undergo atresia and a few grow to form preovulatory follicles. In ovaries (PND 4) obtained from female C57BL/6 mice, BPA treatment for 10 days can reduce the primordial follicle number, but increases the primary follicle number during the early time points (≤ 5 days) through the PI3K/Akt pathway, which is a critical regulator of early follicle growth (Zhao et al., 2014). However, addition of BPA (440 μM) to F344 rat ovaries (PND 4) for 2–8 days will decrease primary and secondary follicle numbers after 2 days and primordial follicle numbers after 4 days. The levels of phosphorylated H2AX (γH2AX) and ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM), which are markers of DNA double-strand breaks, are promoted prior to observed follicle loss. Furthermore, DNA repair genes (e.g., *Atm, Prkdc, Xrcc6, Brca1, Mre11a, Rad50,* and *Smc1a*) and proteins (e.g., MEH, Akt, JNK,

and p53) are reportedly increased in ovaries after 1 day of BPA exposure, while glutathione S-transferase pi isoform and nuclear factor erythroid-related factor 2 (Nrf2) are decreased ([Ganesan and Keating, 2016](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2016.01.027)). BPA treatment also reportedly increases the mRNA level of the pro-apoptotic gene *Bax* in oocytes by decreasing the expression of oocyte-specific genes, such as *Lhx8*, *Figla*, *Sohlh2*, and *Nobox* ([Zhang et al., 2014c](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2014.09.012)). Decreased mRNA expression of specific meiotic genes including *Stra8*, *Dmc1*, *Rec8*, and *Scp3* after BPA treatment is associated with a delay in the meiotic progression of oocytes to prophase I ([Zhang et al., 2012a](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2012.01.012)).

Follicle growth was inhibited in antral follicles isolated from female FVN mice (PND 32–35) after treatment with 100 μg/ml BPA but not 1 and 10 μg/ml for 72 h. Moreover, follicular atresia is reported to be induced after 48–120 h exposure to 100 μg/ml BPA. However, BPA can up-regulate both cell cycle regulators (*Cdk4* and *Ccne1*) and inhibitor (*Trp53*), but down-regulates *Ccn2*. Additionally, BPA also promotes the expression of both *Bax*, a pro-atretic factor, and *Bcl-2*, an anti-atretic factor ([Peretz et al., 2012](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.reprotox.2012.03.001)). These results may mean that high-dose BPA exposure (100 μg/ml in case of antral follicles) stimulates anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic signaling pathways more efficiently than low-dose pro-proliferative and anti-apoptotic pathways. Further studies are required to better understand the mechanism of BPA-induced growth inhibition and atresia of antral follicles.

Human corpus luteum contains cells of small luteal cells (theca-lutein cells) and large luteal cells (granulosa-lutein cells). Large luteal cells secrete large amounts of progesterone ([Christenson and Devoto, 2003](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0303-7207(03)00066-8); [Murphy, 2000](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0303-7207(00)00186-8)). Addition of BPA (1 μg/ml) to large luteal cells collected from women increases MMP-9 production and BPA-mediated cytotoxicity toward cells ([Domínguez et al., 2008](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tox.2008.04.003)).

Furthermore, caspase-3 is reportedly activated in the granulosa cells of the atretic follicles as well as in the luteal cells of the corpus luteum of female Sprague-Dawley rats exposed to BPA (1 and 100 μg/kg BW/day by oral gavage) for 90 days. In addition to caspase-3-mediated apoptosis, the down-regulation of cytochrome P450 (CYP450) aromatase (CYP450arom or P450arom), and steroidogenic acute regulatory (StAR) in granulosa and theca-interstitial cells, leads to

decreased serum levels of 17β-estradiol and testosterone, and increased luteinizing hormone (LH) levels after BPA treatment, respectively ([Lee et al., 2013](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.reprotox.2013.03.001)).

### 3.1.3. BPA and the placenta

The placenta can be an important target of BPA. Trophoblastic cells (e.g., BeWo and JEG-3) that develop mainly into the placenta are commonly used in the study of placental function. In cell experiments using JEG-3 trophoblastic cells short-term exposure to BPA increases CYP450arom activity, but long-term exposure is inhibitory ([Nativelle-Serpentini et al., 2003](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0303-7207(03)00066-8)). BPA treatment (1 and 10 μM) increases the cell proliferation of BeWo trophoblastic cells. However, proliferation is decreased at 1000 μM BPA. Treatment with 100 μM BPA is associated with the down-regulation of E-cadherin and the up-regulation of DNMT1, where their expression levels are opposite at 0.1–10 μM BPA. Conversely, the expressions of MMP-2 and -9 are decreased and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1 and -2 are increased with increasing BPA concentration (0.1–100 μM). These alterations of the expression level of E-cadherin, DNMT1, TIMP-1 and -2, and MMP-2, and -9 are associated with reduced invasion ability of BeWo cells ([Wang et al., 2015c](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tox.2015.04.003)). In a study using JEG-3 trophoblastic cells, BPA (10 and 100 nM) exhibited anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects on cells by decreasing mRNA expression of c-myc and increasing pro-apoptotic p53 mRNA expression ([Morice et al., 2011](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tox.2011.02.001)). In addition, a recent study suggested that BPA can reduce the activation of the antioxidant response element (ARE) in BeWo cells by decreasing the expression and nuclear translocation of Nrf2, an important ARE activator, and can increase the levels of anti-apoptotic proteins, such as Bcl-2 and heat shock protein 70, in conditions of stress. These findings mean that BPA can inhibit trophoblast cell death under conditions of cellular stress ([Ponniah et al., 2015](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tox.2015.04.003)).

Pregnant CD-1 mice treated with BPA (50 mg/kg BW) from GD 1 to 11 by oral administration are reported to display induced degeneration, necrosis of giant cells, and vacuolization in the junctional zone. However, glycogen does not accumulate and the spongiotrophoblast layer is reduced. On the other hand, mice exposed to BPA (5 mg/kg BW)

display increased glycogen depletion and nuclear accumulation of β-catenin in trophoblasts of labyrinthine and spongiotrophoblast layers through the Wnt/β-catenin pathway (Tait et al., 2015). In addition, among 11 protein kinase C (PKC) isozymes (Kang et al., 2012), PKCδ, ζ, and λ (PKCλ is the mouse homolog of human PKCι) are activated in the placentas of BPA-treated female ICR mice. The function of these proteins in the placenta is unclear (Tan et al., 2013).

### 3.2. BPA and male reproductive toxicity-related cell signaling pathways

#### 3.2.1. BAP and spermatogenesis and sperm quality

BPA affects spermatogenesis and sperm quality through several signaling pathways (Fig. 3). BPA is related to decreased proliferation and increased damage and apoptosis of spermatogenic cells. BPA exposure notably increases the injury of mouse spermatocyte-derived GC-2 cells by increasing the release of mitochondrial cytochrome and activating caspase-3. The Ca²⁺/calmodulin (CaM)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) signaling pathway may partially participate in GC-2 cell injuries (Qian et al., 2015). Similarly, BPA-treated male rats display elevated levels of cytochrome C and apoptosis-related factors (caspase-3 and -9, and Bax) and higher apoptosis indices of spermatogenic cells (Wang et al., 2014b). Furthermore, damage and apoptosis of spermatogenic cells can be stimulated by the accumulation of BPA-mediated reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS accelerate the damage of the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria, and the activation of endoplasmic reticulum stress-related proteins in spermatocyte GC-2 cells and mice through the PERK/EIF2α/chop endoplasmic reticulum stress pathway (Yin et al., 2017). BPA-induced oxidative stress also leads to increased apoptosis in rat testes and epididymal sperm by decreasing the expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 (Othman et al., 2016). Decreased testes weight, testis coefficient, sperm density, sperm activity, and sperm survival rate, and increased sperm abnormality rate, are observed in Wistar male rats exposed to BPA. The levels of ERK1/2 and cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element (CRE) binding protein (CREB) expression are positively correlated with sperm density, sperm activity, and sperm survival rate. However, the protein levels are negatively correlated with sperm abnormality (Li et al., 2016a). In another study using BPA-treated Wistar male rats, the activation of ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated and checkpoint kinase 2 signal pathway, as well as the ER pathway-induced meiotic cycle delay and germ cell apoptosis through caspase-3, resulted in BPA-induced sperm count reduction (Liu et al., 2013a). As another signaling pathway of germ cell apoptosis, an increase of ADAM metallopeptidase domain 17 translocation to the cell surface and p38 MAPK activation is involved in germ cell apoptosis induced by a single-dose injection of BPA (50 mg/kg) (Urriola-Muñoz et al., 2014). In addition, male Wistar rats treated with BPA (20 μg/kg BW/day; oral gavage) for 60 days show a clear increase in the markers of DNA double-strand breaks, γH2AX and ATM. Increased occurrence of these markers are related to spermiation delay and meiotic abnormalities, resulting in impaired spermatogenesis (Liu et al., 2014a).

Sertoli cells (sustentacular cells) are the somatic cells of the testis. These cells are critical in testis formation and spermatogenesis (Griswold, 1998; Rato et al., 2012). Sertoli TM4 cells exposed to BPA exhibit typical characteristics of apoptosis, including the loss of mitochondrial mass, increased release of cytochrome C, down-regulation of the Bcl-2 family, and up-regulation of caspase-3. The CaM/CaMKII/ERK1/2 pathway may partially participate in BPA-induce cell damage in TM4 cells (Qian et al., 2014). However, further studies are required to confirm whether the CaM/CaMKII pathway can directly trigger caspases in BPA-mediated injuries of Sertoli TM4 and spermatocyte-derived GC-2 cells. Another study using Sertoli TM4 cells suggests that the GPER/EGFR/ERK pathway is the downstream transduction pathway in BPA (1 or 10 nM)-induced cell proliferation (Ge et al., 2014a). Moreover, exposure to micromolar BPA (10 μM) inhibits TM4 cell proliferation through the reduction of pro-proliferative cyclin D1,

PCNA, and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2, while exposure to nanomolar BPA (10 nM) increases cell proliferation through enhanced PCNA and Bcl-2 expression (Ge et al., 2014b). Additionally, Sertoli cells exposed to BPA display increased levels of PTEN protein and reduced Akt activation. Despite the decreased procaspase-3 levels, these changes of PTEN/Akt pathway may be closely related to apoptosis Sertoli cells after BPA treatment (Wang et al., 2015a). Another study performed by the same laboratory reported that BPA treatment induces the activation of JNK and p38 MAPK, and the activation and nuclear translocation of NF-κB. These signaling pathways are involved in BPA-induced apoptosis of Sertoli cells, as well as increased activation of Fas/Fas ligand (FasL) and caspase-3 (Qi et al., 2014). When pregnant rats were treated daily by gavage with BPA (1–200 mg/kg/day) from GD 14 to birth, male offspring at PND 3 showed increased c-Raf and ERK1/2 expression in Sertoli cells, but MAPK kinase 1 (MEK1) expression was not changed. At PND 60, ERK1/2 expression remained robust in Sertoli cells, but c-Raf was predominant in Leydig cells and pachytene spermatocytes and MEK1 were demonstrated in spermatogonia and pachytene spermatocytes (Thuillier et al., 2009).

Enhanced expression of Fas, FasL, and caspase-3 reduces spermatogenesis and sperm quality. Expression of Fas, FasL, and caspase-3 is reportedly increased in germ cells of male Sprague-Dawley rats treated with BPA (2 μg/kg/day) for 14 days (Jin et al., 2013), in Sertoli and Leydig cells, primary spermatocytes, and/or spermatids of male Kunming mice exposed to BPA (480 and 960 mg/kg/day) from PND 31 to 44 (Li et al., 2009), and in primary Sertoli cells obtained from Sprague-Dawley rats (PND 18-22) after BPA treatment (50 and 70 μM) (Qi et al., 2014). Activities of caspase-3, -8 and -9, and Bax can be increased in testes of male CD-1 mice after BPA treatment (480 mg/kg/day; oral gavage) from PND 35 to 49, through both the Fas/FasL signaling pathway and the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway (Wang et al., 2010). In addition, BPA treatment enhances the expression of β-catenin and dickkopf WNT signaling pathway inhibitor 1. Both proteins are important in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, predominantly in the spermatogenic and Leydig cells of ICR mice (Fang et al., 2015b).

#### 3.2.2. BPA and spermatogenesis-related hormone balance

Although BPA can bind AR, it acts as an AR antagonist and reduces AR nuclear translocation (Teng et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2017). The AR antagonism of BPA may be caused by inhibiting the binding of androgen to the amino- and carboxyl-terminal domains of AR and enhancing AR transcriptional corepressors, such as the nuclear receptor corepressor and silencing mediator of retinoic acid and thyroid hormone receptor (Wang et al., 2017). The interaction between androgens (e.g., testosterone) and AR plays a key role in male reproduction. Testosterone is synthesized from cholesterol mainly in Leydig cells (interstitial cells) stimulated by luteinizing hormone (LH), and Sertoli cells stimulated by follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) display increased production of estradiol. The balance of testosterone, LH, and FSH is critical in spermatogenesis and sperm maturation. Testosterone is synthesized as follows. First, cholesterol is transported into mitochondria through StAR. The cholesterol is converted to pregnenolone in the mitochondria through CYP450 side-chain cleavage (CYP450scc or P450scc). This is followed by the conversion of pregnenolone to androstenedione in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum through CYP450₁₇α (P450₁₇α or CYP17A1) and 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3β-HSD). Finally, androstenedione is converted to testosterone by 17β-HSD (Miller and Auchus, 2011). In mammalian testis, CYP450arom is mainly localized in Leydig cells and is involved in the irreversible transformation of androgens into estrogens (Carreau et al., 2003; Miller and Auchus, 2011).

BPA exposure can disrupt the hormone balance of testosterone, LH, and FSH. These effects may be influenced by the exposure period, exposure concentration, and animal models used. Concerning the latter, decreased serum levels of testosterone and LH, but no change of FSH, was noted in 4-week-old Wistar/ST rats treated by daily subcutaneous

injections of BPA (200 mg/kg BW) for 6 weeks (Nakamura et al., 2010). Decreased serum levels of testosterone, LH, and FSH were evident in Wistar rats treated with BPA (5 or 20 mg/kg/day) administered by oral gavage for PND 50–90 (Wisniewski et al., 2015). Female Wistar rats treated with BPA (2.5 mg/kg/day in their drinking water) and BPA (3 μg/kg/day in their drinking water) from GD 0 to PND 21 displayed decreased serum levels of testosterone and FSH, but no change of LH levels (Cardoso et al., 2011), while male rats (F1) displayed increased LH and FSH levels, but no change of testosterone levels (Gámez et al., 2014). Finally, 12-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats treated with BPA (2 μg/kg/day by oral gavage) for 14 days displayed decreased serum levels of testosterone and FSH, but increased LH levels (Jin et al., 2013). Several studies have reported that the reduction of testosterone is closely associated with reduced sperm quality in male animals treated with BPA (Cardoso et al., 2011; Jin et al., 2013; Nakamura et al., 2010; Wisniewski et al., 2015).

Similar to BPA-mediated disruption of hormone balances, BPA-mediated disruption of hormone synthesis-related factors can also be affected by the experimental conditions. CYP450arom expression is increased by BPA with time and concentration in rat testicular Leydig R2C cells. The increases have been correlated with COX-2 up-regulation, but BPA exposure reduces testosterone synthesis. The increased CYP450arom and COX-2 activities are triggered by CRE, PKA, Akt, and MAPK signaling pathways (Kim et al., 2010). Exposure of human and rat testis microsomes to BPA inhibits the activities of 3β-HSD, CYP450<sub>17α</sub>, and 17β-HSD3. The sensitivity of 3β-HSD and CYP450<sub>17α</sub> to BPA is higher in humans than rats (Ye et al., 2011). Furthermore, expression of CYP450arom, 3β-HSD, and 17β-HSD are reportedly decreased in the testes of male Sprague-Dawley rats treated with 5 mg/kg BW/day of BPA by oral gavage for 8 weeks. In these rats, StAR and CYP450scc are increased. The spermatogenesis-related proteins ODF1 and TNP1 are also reported to be reduced after BPA treatment (Qiu et al., 2013). Decreased expression of StAR, CYP450scc, CYP450<sub>17α</sub>, and 17β-HSD, but no change of CYP450arom and 3β-HSD has been reported in 4-week-old Wistar/ST rats exposed to BPA (200 mg/kg/day; subcutaneous injection) for 6 weeks (Nakamura et al., 2010).

Glucose is an essential factor for testosterone production in the testis. BPA treatment can increase the plasma levels of glucose and insulin, but decreases the testicular glucose and insulin levels in male Wistar rats treated with BPA (0.005–500 μg/kg BW/day; oral gavage) for 45 days (D'Cruz et al., 2012b). Furthermore, the insulin signaling enzymes IR, IRS-1, and PI3K are significantly decreased in the testis. Glucose transporters in testis tissue, such as glucose transporter (GLUT)-2 and -8, and hormone synthesis-related factors, such as 3β-HSD, 17β-HSD, and StAR, are also reduced after BPA treatment, which results in decreased levels of testosterone (D'Cruz et al., 2012a).

In addition, BPA exposure (10 nM) for 3 days shows no effect on the *Insl3* mRNA level, which is expressed in testis Leydig cells in rat and mouse fetal testes, but reduces *Insl3* mRNA levels in human testes by more than 20%. However, higher concentration of BPA (10 μM) decreases the *Insl3* mRNA level in mouse fetal testes (N'Tumba-Byn et al., 2012). These results may mean that human testes are more sensitive to BPA exposure than rodent testes.

Taken together, BPA exposure is related to male reproductive toxicity by 1) decreasing the proliferation of spermatogenic cells through the reduction of pro-proliferative factors (e.g., cyclin D1 and Akt), 2) increasing the damage and apoptosis of spermatogenic cells through the activation of apoptotic signaling pathways (e.g., caspases, Bax, and MAPK) and the depression of anti-apoptotic factors (e.g., Bcl-2), and 3) disrupting hormone balance through decreased enzyme activity involved in hormone production, such as StAR, CYP450scc, CYP450<sub>17α</sub>, 3β-HSD, and 17β-HSD.

4. BPA and inflammatory or immune response-related cell signaling pathways

BPA affects inflammation and immune responses through several signaling pathways and the alteration of various immune cells, such as CD4<sup>+</sup> T helper (Th) lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, macrophages, mast cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and dendritic cells (DCs).

### 4.1. BPA and immune cells

#### 4.1.1. BPA and mast cells

BPA exposure (50 μM) increases the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α and interleukin (IL)-6, in HMC-1 human mast cells by activating inflammatory response-related signals, such as PKC, p38 MAPK, and NF-κB (Lee and Lim, 2010a). In another study that also used HMC-1 cells and BPA dose, BPA exposure increased the activation of COX-2, AP-1, ERK, and JNK, in association with increased levels of interferon-gamma (INF-γ) and IL-4 (Shim and Lim, 2009). On the other hand, BPA treatment of RBL-2H3 rat leukemia mast cells induced the activation of ERK1/2, p38 MAPK, COX-2, and AP-1, and the production of nitric oxide (NO). Increased serum levels of immunoglobulin E (IgE), β-hexosaminidase, and histamine have been described in BPA-treated BALB/c mice (Lee et al., 2012b). The release of histamine and expression of IL-4 and IFN-γ are all increased in BPA-treated RBL-2H3 cells through Ca<sup>2+</sup>/PKCα and NF-κB pathways (Park and Lim, 2010). On the other hand, estrogenic compounds, including diethylstilbestrol, 17β-estradiol, and BPA, can bind to the C2 domain (Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding motif) of PKCα, and can also inhibit the phosphorylation of PKCα at high doses of BPA, such as 10 μM (Alzamora et al., 2007; Kang et al., 2009).

The addition of BPA (10–1000 nM) to primary bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs) prepared from female C57BL/6 mice promotes histamine and cysteinyl leukotriene (CysLT) release through the ERK1/2 pathway (O'Brien et al., 2014b). After the addition of anti-dinitrophenyl (DNP) IgE antibody and DNP-bovine serum albumin, the levels of lipid mediators (e.g., CysLT and prostaglandin D2), TNF-α, and IL-13, but not IL-4, -5, and -6, are increased in BMMCs obtained from the offspring of C57BL/6 and C3H/HeJ mice treated with BPA (50 μg and 50 mg/kg/day) throughout gestation and lactation until weaning on PND 21 (O'Brien et al., 2014c).

#### 4.1.2. BPA and macrophages

Macrophages comprise the M1- and M2-type. M1-type macrophages are characterized by the secretion of inflammatory cytokines including TNF-α and IL-6. M2 macrophages secrete anti-inflammatory cytokines like IL-10. BV2 microglial cells treated with BPA (10–1000 nM) display activation of ERβ, ERK, JNK, and NF-κB, and increased TNF-α and IL-6 inflammatory cytokines (Zhu et al., 2015). BPA treatment (10–100 nM) of THP-1 human macrophages and primary human macrophages increases TNF-α and IL-6 production, but decreases the production of IL-10 and TGF-β. Modulation of cytokine expression in THP-1 cells is reportedly mediated by the ERK1/2 and NF-κB pathways, but not by the Janus kinase 1, Akt, p38 MAPK, and STAT1 pathways, and by ERα/β but not by GPER (Liu et al., 2014b).

Secretion of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-8 can be increased in THP-1 cells exposed to BPA (0.1–10 μM) plus 10 ng/ml lipopolysaccharide (LPS) through the ERα and ERK1/2 pathways (Couleau et al., 2015). In contrast, suppressive effects of BPA on NO production and NF-κB activation have been observed in LPS-stimulated Raw264.7 macrophages through the ER pathway (Yoshitake et al., 2008). NO production and TNF-α secretion are reduced in peritoneal macrophages acquired from mice orally treated with BPA for 4 weeks are stimulated with BPA and LPS (Byun et al., 2005). Similarly, in peritoneal macrophages from dams and 7-week-old offspring of dams exposed to BPA (75 mg/l and 300 mg/l) from GD 7 to PND 21, BPA addition to macrophages reportedly decreased NO production and TNF-α secretion in the presence of LPS or LPS plus IFN-γ (Pyo et al., 2007). Additionally, BPA-treated

Raw 264.7 cells displayed suppression of Akt, ERK, JNK, and p38 MAPK induced by RANKL, down-regulation of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2, and up-regulation of pro-apoptotic Bax and caspases 3, 8, and 9. BPA treatment can also decrease alkaline phosphatase activity, bone nodule formation, and Bcl-2 expression, but can increase the expression of caspases 3, 8, and 9 in osteoblast-like MC3T3-E1 cells. These results may indicate that BPA can directly suppress both osteoclastic and osteoblastic activities (Hwang et al., 2013a).

### 4.1.3. BPA and T lymphocytes

CD4⁺ Th cell lineages include Th1, Th2, Th17, and regulatory T (Treg). Th1 cells that produce IFN-γ, IL-2, and TNF-α, which can stimulate inflammatory responses, and Th2 cells that produce IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-9, IL-10, and IL-13, which can increase anti-inflammatory and antibody responses (e.g., IgE) and eosinophil accumulation. Th17 cells produce IL-17, IL-21, IL-22, and IL-23, and Treg cells secrete IL-2 and TGF-β (Kidd, 2003; Romagnani, 2000; Zhu et al., 2010).

BPA can promote Th1- and Th2-mediated immune responses, although the Th1 responses may be greater than the Th2 responses in DBA/J fetal mice exposed to BPA (Yoshino et al., 2004). In splenocytes of ICR mice exposed to BPA (0.015, 1.5 or 30 mg/ml) for 4 weeks, Th1 type cytokine (IFN-γ) production is increased, but the Th2 type cytokine (IL-4) is suppressed. Consistently, the transcription factor IRF-1 that is related to INF-γ production is increased, but GATA-binding protein-3 (GATA-3) that regulates IL-4 transcription is decreased after BPA-treated splenocytes (Youn et al., 2002). Similarly, the splenic T cells of BPA-treated DO11.10 mice reportedly display increased IFN-γ production and Th1-type responses (Goto et al., 2007). In one study, Wister female rats were treated orally with BPA (5 μg/kg/day) from GD 15 to PND 21 and their offspring were immunized with OVA at PND 52. Enhanced production of IFN-γ and activation of CD44<sup>high</sup>CD62L<sup>low</sup> memory phenotype CD4⁺ cells, but not CD4⁺CD25⁺FoxP3⁺ Treg cells, were observed in the spleen. Additionally, when BPA-treated OVA-tolerized rats were orally challenged with OVA, colonic inflammation occurred, with neutrophil infiltration, increased IFNγ, and decreased TGF-β (Ménard et al., 2014b). On the other hand, primary cultured mouse lymphocytes stimulated with BPA (50 μM) display Th2 polarization, with increasing Th2 cell-related cytokines (IL-4 and IL-10), as well as p38 MAPK, GATA-3, and t-box expressed in T-cells (Lee and Lim, 2010b). BPA exposure (12.5–200 μM) also can suppress Th1-type immune response in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) (Gostner et al., 2015). Attractively, exposure to BPA in adulthood following infection of *Leishmania major* reportedly increases the production of IL-4, IL-10, and IL-13, but not INF-γ. However, mice prenatally exposed to BPA and then infected with *L. major* display increased production of both IL-4 and INF-γ. The percentages of CD4⁺CD25⁺ Treg cells among CD4⁺ T cells are decreased in mice exposed to BPA prenatally and as adults, but will increase after infection with *L. major* (Yan et al., 2008). These observations highlight the need for further studies to fully understand the BPA-induced polarization of CD4⁺ lymphocytes, especially whether BPA stimulates Th1 or Th2 polarization.

At PND 21 and 42, offspring mice from pregnant dams exposed to BPA (100 or 1000 nM) from GD 0 to PND 21 display an induced increase in the number of Th17 cells in association with an increase of mRNA expression of RORγt (a transcription factor of Th17 cells), Th17 cell-derived serum cytokines (IL-17 and IL-21), and Th17 cell differentiation-related cytokines (IL-6 and IL-23). However, TGF-β is not increased. These changes are more pronounced in female than male offspring (Luo et al., 2016).

### 4.1.4. BPA and B lymphocytes

A major function of B cells is antibody production, such as IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM (Hoffman et al., 2016). *In vivo*, BPA treatment increases several antibodies (e.g., IgA, IgE, IgG, and IgM) through B cells (Goto et al., 2007; He et al., 2016; Lee et al., 2012b; Midoro-Horiuti

et al., 2010; Petzold et al., 2014; Yurino et al., 2004);). BPA (1–10 μM) also suppresses lymphocyte mitogenesis through ERα in B and T cells (Sakazaki et al., 2002).

#### 4.1.5. BPA and dendritic cells

BPA exposure induces the differentiation of PBMCs to DCs at a concentration of 1 nM (Camarca et al., 2016) and the differentiation of murine bone marrow DCs, depending on BPA doses (0.1–10 μM) (Pisapia et al., 2012), but has no effect on the differentiation of human monocyte-derived DCs at a concentration of 50 μM (Švajger et al., 2016). However, BPA shows no effect on DC maturation (Camarca et al., 2016; Guo et al., 2010; Švajger et al., 2016). DCs treated with BPA in combination with TNF-α dose-dependently enhanced the levels of CC chemokine ligand 1 (CCL1) and IL-10/IL-12p70, which indicates DC-mediated Th2 polarization (Guo et al., 2010). Furthermore, perinatal exposure to BPA can decrease DC populations, as well as Treg cells and Th lymphocytes, in the spleen. In one study, these changes of immune cells allowed the increase in viable *Nippostrongylus brasiliensis* larvae in the intestine of BPA-exposed rats (Ménard et al., 2014a).

The collective observations indicate that BPA-mediated inflammatory responses are induced mainly by the MAPK family as a key mediator of a signaling pathway related to inflammatory responses and transcriptional factors, such as AP-1, NF-κB, and STAT family. Furthermore, BPA-mediated immune responses are stimulated by the alteration of various immune cells through several receptors, such as ERα/β (Couleau et al., 2015; Guo et al., 2010; Liu et al., 2014b; Sakazaki et al., 2002; Yurino et al., 2004; Zhu et al., 2015), GPER (or GPR 30) (Guo et al., 2010), and GR (Petzold et al., 2014). A previous review has reported that aryl hydrocarbon receptors and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) family (e.g., PPARγ) may be involved in BPA-mediated immune responses (Rogers et al., 2013). However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no data on BPA-triggered immune responses through these receptors.

### 4.2. BPA and airway diseases

BPA exposure may be related to an increased risk of bronchial hyper-responsiveness, wheezing, and asthma (Robinson and Miller, 2015; Spanier et al., 2012; Xie et al., 2016). In one study, male CD-1 mice (5 weeks) treated with BPA (5 mg/ml) plus ovalbumin (OVA; 1 μg) four times at one-week intervals displayed increased levels of CXCL1, IL-1β, IL-6, CCL2, eosinophil-produced IL-5, and Th2 relevant cytokine IL-13 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Similar results were obtained from Raw264.7 macrophage cells exposed to BPA (5 μg/ml) plus OVA (0.5 μg/ml). Furthermore, OVA-specific IgE and IgG1 production was also increased in BALF (He et al., 2016). When offspring mice of BALB/c mice exposed to BPA (10 μg/ml) throughout pregnancy and lactation were immunized with OVA at PND 4, 13, 14 and 15, enhanced eosinophil numbers in BALFs and serum levels of anti-OVA IgE were identified (Midoro-Horiuti et al., 2010). However, the authors reported that when adult offspring mice of C37BL/6 treated with BPA (50 or 500 μg/kg/day) from GD 6 to PND 21 were sensitized with OVA plus LPS, they showed no difference in the number of CD4⁺, CD8⁺, or CD4⁺CD25⁺FoxP3⁺ in the lung, and in the levels of IL-5, IL-17, and serum OVA-specific IgE, compared with adult offspring of corresponding vehicle-treated dams (Bauer et al., 2012). On the other hand, when OVA was intraperitoneally injected into the 12-week-old offspring of BALB/c mice treated with BPA (50 μg and 50 mg/kg/day) throughout gestation and lactation until weaning on PND 21, the production of IL-13 and INF-γ in splenocytes and the serum IgE levels were increased, but OVA-induced pulmonary inflammation was not found (O'Brien et al., 2014a). Furthermore, BPA exposure during gestation and lactation (PND 21) following OVA immunization (PND 42–65) had no significant effect on lung inflammatory responses in the adult offspring. However, adult mice exposed to BPA from birth until the last OVA challenge (PND 65) clearly increased eosinophilic inflammation in

the lung, airway hyperreactivity, and serum levels of OVA-specific IgE, compared to mice without BPA exposure (Petzold et al., 2014). These results indicate that the effects of BPA on lung inflammation may be affected by time period and by duration of exposure.

### 4.3. BPA and obesity, insulin-resistance, and metabolic syndrome

Several studies have suggested that high serum or urinary BPA levels are positively correlated with obesity, insulin-resistance, and metabolic syndrome. These metabolic diseases are also related to inflammatory responses (Braun, 2017; Chevalier and Fénichel, 2015; Stojanoska et al., 2017).

BPA exposure can accelerate the development of type 1 diabetes type 1 and inflammation of pancreatic islet cells (insulitis), and increase serum glucose levels (Bodin et al., 2013, 2014). Dysfunction of insulin secretion and apoptosis was reported in BPA-treated rat insulinoma INS-1 cells. The apoptosis of INS-1 cells was induced by increased expression of pro-apoptotic factors Bax, apoptotic protease activating factor 1, and caspase-9, and decreased expression of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 in mitochondria (Lin et al., 2013). Furthermore, mice exposed to 1 nM BPA can display decreased K<sub>ATP</sub> channel activity and increased glucose-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals and insulin release in β-cells through ERβ (Soriano et al., 2012). In a mouse model of diabetes involving streptozotocin-induced insulin-deficiency, BPA exposure can increase serum insulin levels, and expression of pancreatic ERα/β, pro-apoptotic Bcl-2, and inflammatory-related cytokines including TNF-α and IL-1 (Kang et al., 2014). Additionally, long-term oral exposure to BPA (50 μg/kg/day) along with a high-fat diet for 12 weeks can increase glucose intolerance and serum IL-6 and TNF-α levels, but will decrease Akt and GSK3β phosphorylation in skeletal muscle and serum adiponectin levels (Moon et al., 2015). Furthermore, BPA exposure during pregnancy reportedly impairs insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation in skeletal muscle and liver of pregnant mice, increases serum insulin, leptin, triglyceride (TG), and glycerol levels, and increases insulin resistance. In a study that examined male offspring of BPA-treated pregnant mice, insulin sensitivity was decreased, but serum insulin and glycerol levels, glucose-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals, and bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation into β cells were increased (Alonso-Magdalena et al., 2010). After BPA exposure during pregnancy, the reduction of insulin secretion is associated with decreased pancreatic β-cell mass and expression of cell cycle activators, cyclin D2 and CDK4, and increased β-cells apoptosis and cell cycle inhibitors, p16 and p53 (Alonso-Magdalena et al., 2015). Short-term (8 days) treatment with BPA (100 μg/kg) can decrease insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of the IR β-subunit in BPA-treated mice, in association with a reduction of Akt phosphorylation. Moreover, up-regulation of IRS-1 in skeletal muscle and liver and down-regulation of insulin-stimulated ERK1/2 signaling in skeletal muscle have been described following BPA treatment (Batista et al., 2012). In addition, perinatal BPA exposure can increase the risk of glucose tolerance in offspring. When female Sprague Dawley rats (9-weeks old) were exposed to BPA supplied in the drinking water from 2 weeks prior to mating and through pregnancy and lactation, male offspring showed lower GLUT-2 and higher IRS-1 and IR-β levels in the liver at 3 weeks of age and higher plasma insulin levels at 24 weeks of age compared with controls. In the skeletal muscle at 10 months of age, the IR-β levels were higher in male offspring and the GLUT-4 levels were lower in both male and female offspring (Galyon et al., 2017).

BPA treatment (1 μM for 24 h) increases the activation of glucocorticoid receptor (GR), which plays a critical role in adipocyte differentiation, and adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 cells that can differentiate to adipocyte-like cells (Sargis et al., 2010). In 3T3-L1 cells treated with low-dose BPA (1 nM) for 2 weeks, the expression of adipogenic markers was increased, such as the expression of leptin, PPARγ, fatty acid binding protein 4/adipocyte protein 2 (AP2), and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBPα), as well as inflammatory markers, such as IL-
6 and INF-γ. In the presence of BPA, mature adipocytes exhibit significant reduction of insulin-stimulated glucose utilization and ERK1/2 and Akt phosphorylation (Ariemma et al., 2016). In another study, BPA (1 nM)-treated 3T3-L1 cells displayed reduced insulin-stimulated glucose utilization and insulin-activated receptor phosphorylation and signaling, and increased release of IL-6 and IFN-γ via activation of the JNK, STAT3, and NF-κB pathways. However, adipocyte differentiation and the adipogenic markers, PPARγ and GLUT-4, were unchanged (Valentino et al., 2013). MicroRNA-21a-5p regulates adipogenic differentiation. This can reduce lipid droplets, TG level, and expressions of PPARγ, C/EBPα and adiponectin in BPA-treated 3T3-L1 cells by inhibiting adipogenic differentiation through the MKK3/p38 MAPK pathway (Xie et al., 2016b). Additionally, BPA exposure promotes adipogenesis and adipogenesis-associated genes, such as DLK, IGF1, C/EBPa, PPARγ, and LPL, in human adipose-derived stromal/stem cells (Ohlstein et al., 2014). Gene expression microarray analysis has demonstrated that the addition of BPA (50 μM) to preadipocytes increases adipogenesis- and lipid accumulation-related genes, such as SREBF1, as well as thyroid receptor/retinoic X receptor and mTOR signaling pathways (Boucher et al., 2014). The expression of the master genes of adipogenesis, such as C/EBPa, PPARγ, and AP2, as well as inflammatory genes, such as IL-6, TNF-α, IL-1β, IFN-γ, and inducible nitric oxide synthase2 (iNOS2), are also increased in the inguinal white adipose tissues of BPA-treated C57BL/6J mice fed a low-calorie diet, but not a high-fat diet. BPA exposure can induce adipocyte differentiation through GR signaling (Yang et al., 2016). Furthermore, the activity of 11β-HSD1 through GR activation is increased in the adipose tissues of children and the visceral adipocytes treated with BPA at 10 nM and 80 μM, but not at 1 μM, compared with controls (Wang et al., 2013).

Taken together, BPA exposure stimulates immune cell-mediated inflammatory responses and increases the production of pro-inflammatory mediators, such as TNF-α and IL-6, mainly by the activation of MAPK signaling pathways. BPA-induced inflammatory responses are related to an increased risk of inflammatory diseases, such as airway diseases and metabolic diseases, including obesity, insulin-resistance, and metabolic syndrome.

## 5. BPA and brain and nervous system-related cell signaling pathways

BPA can induce developmental disorders of the brain and nervous system. Reduced visual and spatial memory (Bowman et al., 2015; Eilam-Stock et al., 2012; Kumar and Thakur, 2014; Wang et al., 2016), migraine-like behaviors (Vermeer et al., 2014), enhanced fear memory (Zhang et al., 2014b), and dendritic morphogenesis of hippocampal neurons (Xu et al., 2014) have been reported following BPA treatment. Several receptors are involved in BPA-mediated disorders of the brain and nervous system. These include IR (Fang et al., 2016; Li et al., 2016b), ERα/β (Chen et al., 2014; Vermeer et al., 2014; Xu et al., 2014, 2015), GR (Chen et al., 2014), gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)<sub>A</sub> receptor (Xu et al., 2015), N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor (Xu et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2014b), and GPER (or GPR30) (Vermeer et al., 2014). The binding of insulin to the IR stimulates IRS proteins and their downstream signals, such as Akt and GSK3β, that play a critical role in the development of neuronal systems (Plum et al., 2005). GLUTs that are primarily present at the blood-brain barrier transfer glucose from the blood to the brain (Qutub and Hunt, 2005).

The hippocampus is a region of the mammalian brain that forms a part of the limbic system and participates in learning and memory, anxiety, and stress regulation (Leuner and Gould, 2010). The cerebral cortex is the outer surface of the brain. It is functionally divided into sensory, motor, and association areas (Kaas, 2008). BPA can affect structure and function of hippocampus and cerebral cortex. Perinatal BPA exposure decreases insulin signaling in the brain including insulin, IR, Akt, GSK3β, and ERK1/2, as well as GLUT-1, -3, and -4. In contrast, tau and β-amyloid precursor protein (β-APP) are markedly up-regulated

in BPA-treated groups (Fang et al., 2016). In one study, adult male mice exposed to BPA (100 μg/kg/day) for 15 days exhibited decreased insulin signaling pathways, such as IR/IRS/Akt/GSK3β and IR/IRS/ERK1/2 signaling. GLUT-1 and -3 in the hippocampus and GLUT-1 and -4 in the cortex of brain were also decreased after BPA treatment (Fang et al., 2015a). In another study performed by the same laboratory, however, adult male mice treated with BPA (100 μg/kg/day) for 30 days showed the hyperactivation of IR/IRS/Akt/GSK3β axis in the hippocampus and cortex of brain, whereas insulin sensitivity and protein levels of GLUT-1 and -3 were decreased, but GLUT-4 was increased. On the other hand, phosphorylated tau and β-APP were increased in BPA-treated adult mice (Li et al., 2016b).

Exposure to BPA inhibits proliferation and differentiation of neural stem cells through the suppression of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway (Tiwari et al., 2015b), and impairs survival and differentiation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells and myelination potential in the hippocampus (Tiwari et al., 2015a). These events result in the reduction of neurogenesis. Furthermore, BPA treatment increases the levels of autophagy proteins, LC3-II, beclin-1, and HMGB1 in the hippocampus, in association with activation of AMP-activated protein kinase and down-regulation of mTOR signaling. These events result in hippocampal neurodegeneration (Agarwal et al., 2015). Migraine-like behaviors have been demonstrated in BPA-treated multi-behavior models of rat migraine. BPA-exposed rats were reported to show increased levels of ERα and GPER, activation of ERK1/2, as well as activation of the Naᵥ1.8 sodium channel and fatty acid amide hydrolase (Vermeer et al., 2014). The levels of CREB and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), as well as Akt and ERK1/2, are reportedly decreased in the male offspring hippocampus after maternal BPA exposure (0.5–50 mg/kg BW/day) for GD 9–20. Decreased Akt activation and inhibited ERK1/2/CREB/BDNF pathway in the hippocampus are related to the impairment of object recognition memory (Wang et al., 2016). Long-term (90 days) exposure to BPA is reported to promote fear memory associated with an increased level of NMDA receptor and/or histone acetylation in the hippocampus through the activation of ERK1/2 signaling pathway (Zhang et al., 2014b). Additionally, male offspring of pregnant mice treated with BPA (50 μg/kg/day) from GD 7 to PND 21 can display impaired spatial memory through the up-regulation of the neurexin1 and neuroligin3 synaptic proteins, and increased dendritic spine density in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus (Kumar and Thakur, 2014). BPA exposure increases dendritic morphogenesis of hippocampal neurons. These changes are associated with increased ER and NMDA receptor and ERK1/2 activation. Furthermore, BPA increases Rac1/Cdc42 expression, but decreases RhoA expression in the cultured hippocampal neuron (Xu et al., 2014).

In one study, cerebral cell apoptosis was increased in rats treated with BPA (50 mg/kg) 3 days a week for 6 weeks, through enhanced oxidative stress, up-regulated p53 and CD95 (or Fas), and activated caspase-3 and -8 (El-Missiry et al., 2014). Enhanced BPA-mediated apoptosis in hippocampal HT-22 cells was caused by increased calcium and ROS, and activated ERK, JNK, and caspase-3. However, NF-κB functioned as a survival signal in BPA-treated HT-22 cells (Lee et al., 2008). BPA exposure (100 μM) inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis in rat embryonic midbrain cells through reduced phosphorylation of JNK and CREB, and increased level of Bax and p53 (Liu et al., 2013b).

Several studies have reported sex differences in BPA-mediated disorders of brain and nervous system. BPA exposure decreased the ERβ levels in the hippocampus of adult male mice, but not female mice, and inhibited the protein level of GABA<sub>A</sub>α2 receptor in hippocampus of males, while increased the level in females (Xu et al., 2015). Female offspring of BPA-treated pregnant rats can display a visible anti-anxiety-like behavior, but male offspring demonstrate increased depression-like behavior. The levels of hippocampal mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), neuronal NOS (nNOS), and phosphorylated CREB were reportedly increased in female offspring, but were decreased in male offspring (Chen

et al., 2014). Exposure to BPA (400 μg/kg/day) during development resulted in more neurons and glia in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of male offspring rats, but not female rats (Sadowski et al., 2014). Furthermore, after subcutaneous BPA injections for one week, female Sprague Dawley rats showed greater spine density in the mPFC and hippocampal CA1 region compared to males (Bowman et al., 2014).

## 6. Summary and overall conclusions

Accumulating evidence indicates that BPA is closely related to growth and proliferation of cancer cells, and carcinogenesis through the activation of pro-proliferative (e.g., Akt, c-Raf, and ERK1/2) and anti-apoptotic genes and proteins (e.g., Bcl-2), in association with a reduction of pro-apoptotic signals (e.g., Bax and caspases). These changes also increase drug resistance in many cancer cells, except AML cells.

In contrast to cancer cells and carcinogenesis, increased apoptotic signaling pathways are critical in the BPA-mediated reproductive toxicity. Although proliferative genes and proteins are important in male and female reproductive processes, their abnormal overexpression may be related to carcinogenesis.

BPA-mediated inflammatory responses are caused mainly by the MAPK family and transcriptional factors, such as AP-1, NF-κB, and STAT family. Furthermore, BPA affects immune responses through the alteration of various immune cells, such as CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, B cells, macrophages, mast cells, and DCs. However, it is not clear whether BPA stimulates Th1 or Th2 polarization. In addition, there are very few data on BPA-mediated effects on Th17 cells and, to my knowledge, no data on BPA-mediated effects on NK cells.

Several studies have reported BPA-mediated stimulation of many signaling pathways in cells, but further studies need to confirm whether similar results can be obtained *in vivo*. Furthermore, we strongly suggest that the following factors should be carefully considered to better understand the changes of cell signaling pathways in cells or animal models after BPA treatment:

(i) BPA concentration: The daily human intake of BPA ranges from < 1 to 5 μg/kg BW/day (Chen et al., 2016; Kang et al., 2006b; Thomson et al., 2003; Vandenberg et al., 2007a). In general, BPA-mediated changes of cell signaling pathways are examined using cell and animal models exposed to BPA. However, it is necessary to pay attention to BPA concentrations, because several studies have reported different results of cell signaling pathways following nanomolar and/or micromolar BPA treatment (Table 1). For example, exposure to micromolar BPA (10 μM) can inhibit the proliferation of Sertoli TM4 cells, but cell proliferation can be induced after nanomolar BPA (10 nM) exposure (Ge et al., 2014a). On the other hand, migration and invasion of SW480 colon cancer cells is reportedly increased after micromolar BPA (10 μM) treatment, but decreased after nanomolar (10 nM) BPA treatment (Chen et al., 2015). Furthermore, down-regulation at 10 nM BPA and up-regulation at 100 nM BPA of cyclin E protein expression are observed in human breast epithelial cells (Qin et al., 2012).

(ii) Administration or experiment timing: Administration timing of BPA and experiment timing after BPA exposure also have an effect on the BPA-mediated signaling changes. Generally, rats before and after PND 50 are routinely used for chemically-induced mammary carcinogenesis (Kubatka et al., 2002; Russo and Russo, 1996; Welsch, 1985). However, prenatal exposure to BPA can shift the time of susceptibility from PND 50 to PND 100 for DMBA-induced mammary carcinogenesis (Betancourt et al., 2010a). Furthermore, when pregnant rats were treated with BPA from GD 14 to birth, the expressions of c-Raf, MEK1, and ERK1/2 in testicular cells of male offspring at PND 3 were significantly different from those at PND 60 (Thuillier et al., 2009).

(iii) Cell types: The effects of BPA can differ by cell type. For example, BPA treatment (1 and 10 μM) increases the proliferation of cells of the trophoblastic cell line BeWo (Wang et al., 2015c). However, anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects are evident in the JEG-3

trophoblastic cell line treated with BPA (10 and 100 nM). On the other hand, under the same experimental conditions, BeWo cells do not show any regulation by BPA (Morice et al., 2011). Furthermore, BPA has dual actions as an agonist and antagonist in some types of cells through ERα (Kurosawa et al., 2002).

(iv) In vivo models: Among rodents, rats and mice are used most often for studies of BPA. Different results may be obtained after BPA exposure. In mouse ovaries (PND 4), BPA treatment for 10 days can reduce the primordial follicle number, but increase the primary follicle number during the early time points (≤ 5 days) (Zhao et al., 2014). In contrast to mouse ovaries, the addition of BPA (440 μM) to rat ovaries (PND 4) for 2–8 days can decrease the numbers of primary and secondary follicles after 2 days and primordial follicle numbers after 4 days (Ganesan and Keating, 2016). BPA action is stronger in human islets than in mouse islets in the presence of the same BPA concentration (Soriano et al., 2012). Furthermore, BPA exposure (10 nM) shows no effect on the Insl3 mRNA level in rat and mouse fetal testes, but reduces its levels in human testes (by more than 20%). However, higher concentration of BPA (10 μM) decreases the Insl3 mRNA level in mouse fetal testes (N'Tumba-Byn et al., 2012). These studies suggest that the sensitivity to BPA exposure can differ between rat and mouse or between human and rodent.

(v) Gender: Several studies have reported that BPA-mediated disruption of signaling pathways can differ in males and females, especially in the brain and nervous system. BPA exposure down-regulates the ERβ levels in the hippocampus of adult males, but not females, and inhibits the protein level of GABA<sub>A</sub>α2 receptor in the hippocampus of males, but promotes that of females (Xu et al., 2015). Furthermore, exposure to BPA throughout pregnancy can produce anti-anxiety-like behavior in female offspring, but a depression-like behavior in male offspring. The levels of hippocampal MR, nNOS, and phosphorylated CREB are reportedly increased in female offspring, but are decreased in male offspring (Chen et al., 2014).
