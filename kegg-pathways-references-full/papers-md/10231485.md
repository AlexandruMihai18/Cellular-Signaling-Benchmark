## Summary

A range of bacteria are able to use tetrathionate as a terminal respiratory electron acceptor. Here we report the identification and characterization of the *ttrRSBCA* locus required for tetrathionate respiration in *Salmonella typhimurium* LT2a. The *ttr* genes are located within *Salmonella* pathogenicity island 2 at centisome 30.5. *ttrA*, *ttrB* and *ttrC* are the tetrathionate reductase structural genes. Sequence analysis suggests that TtrA contains a molybdopterin guanine dinucleotide cofactor and a [4Fe–4S] cluster, that TtrB binds four [4Fe–4S] clusters, and that TtrC is an integral membrane protein containing a quinol oxidation site. TtrA and TtrB are predicted to be anchored by TtrC to the periplasmic face of the cytoplasmic membrane implying a periplasmic site for tetrathionate reduction. It is inferred that the tetrathionate reductase, together with thiosulphate and polysulphide reductases, make up a previously unrecognized class of molybdopterin-dependent enzymes that carry out the reductive cleavage of sulphur–sulphur bonds. Cys-256 in TtrA is proposed to be the amino acid ligand to the molybdopterin cofactor. TtrS and TtrR are the sensor and response regulator components of a two-component regulatory system that is absolutely required for transcription of the *ttrBCA* operon. Expression of an active tetrathionate reduction system also requires the anoxia-responsive global transcriptional regulator Fnr. The *ttrRSBCA* gene cluster confers on *Escherichia coli* the ability to respire with tetrathionate as electron acceptor.

## Introduction

The ability to respire tetrathionate is characteristic of certain genera of Enterobacteriaceae including *Salmonella*, *Citrobacter* and *Proteus* (Richard, 1977; Barrett and Clark, 1987). The differential ability of Enterobacteriaceae to respire tetrathionate is exploited in the clinical diagnostic laboratory where tetrathionate broth is used as a standard enrichment medium for *Salmonella* species. Similarly, Richard (1977) has pioneered the use of the tetrathionate respiration phenotype in the classification of Enterobacteriaceae. The occurrence of tetrathionate respiration has not been so extensively studied in other bacterial families, but it is clear that the metabolism is phylogenetically widespread (Barrett and Clark, 1987), allowing bacteria to take advantage of the availability of tetrathionate in many environments (Barrett and Clark, 1987; Barbosa-Jefferson *et al.*, 1998).

In *Salmonella enterica* serovar Typhimurium (hereafter *S.* typhimurium) the tetrathionate reductase (Ttr) is a membrane-bound enzyme containing molybdopterin guanine dinucleotide cofactor (MGD) as a prosthetic group (Casse *et al.*, 1972; Hinojosa-Leon *et al.*, 1986). Ttr catalyses the two-electron reduction of tetrathionate to two molecules of thiosulphate (Table 1, reaction 1). When tetrathionate in the growth medium has been fully reduced the bacterium can utilize the thiosulphate produced as an additional electron acceptor. Thiosulphate is reductively cleaved to sulphite plus sulphide by the enzyme thiosulphate reductase (Phs; production of hydrogen sulphide), a membrane-bound, MGD-binding enzyme that utilizes menaquinol as electron donor (Table 1, reaction 2). Sulphite is further reduced by the cytoplasmic enzyme sulphite reductase (Asr; anaerobic sulphite reductase) (Table 1, reaction 3).

In *Proteus mirabilis* a single enzyme is reported to catalyse both tetrathionate and thiosulphate reduction (Oltmann *et al.*, 1974). Like the Ttr and Phs enzymes of *S.* typhimurium, the bifunctional reductase from *P.* mirabilis is a membrane-bound molybdenum protein (Oltmann *et al.*, 1979).

The presence of a molybdopterin cofactor in tetrathionate and thiosulphate reductases deserves comment. The molybdopterin cofactor is normally regarded as carrying out reactions in which either (i) an oxygen atom is transferred between substrate and water via the molybdenum co-ordination sphere, or (ii) the molybdenum atom abstracts a hydrogen atom from the substrate or (iii) these reactions are combined to effect a hydroxylation of

the substrate (Hille, 1996; Khangulov et al., 1998). Clearly the reactions catalysed by Ttr, Phs or the MGD-dependent polysulphide reductase (Psr) of *Wolinella succinogenes* (Table 1, reaction 4) do not fall into one of these categories. The Phs and Psr reactions can be described as sulphur atom transfers. Alternatively, the reactions catalysed by these enzymes as well as that performed by Ttr can be viewed as the reductive cleavage of a sulphur–sulphur bond. In either case, the reaction would represent a previously unrecognized function of the molybdopterin cofactor in biology.

Although tetrathionate reduction is an important bacterial anaerobic respiratory process with intriguing catalytic chemistry our knowledge of this metabolism at the molecular level is rudimentary. Taking advantage of the sophisticated systems of genetic analysis available for *S.* typhimurium, we have initiated a molecular study of tetrathionate reduction in this organism. We report here the identification and characterization of the genetic locus required for tetrathionate respiration.

### Results and discussion

#### Isolation of mutants with defects in tetrathionate respiration

A mutagenesis approach was used to identify the genetic loci in *S.* typhimurium specifically required for tetrathionate respiration. A pool of random miniTn10 transposon insertions was screened for the ability to reduce tetrathionate (Ttr phenotype) using the EMB-tetrathionate indicator agar of Le Minor et al. (1970). When cultured on this medium cells respiring tetrathionate develop a metallic sheen. In addition, the large quantities of acid produced during tetrathionate respiration turns the agar around the colonies from red to deep purple. Cells that are unable to reduce tetrathionate fail to develop the metallic sheen and the surrounding agar remains red. From a screen of 15 000 bacteria harbouring mini-Tn10 insertions we isolated nine Ttr$^{-}$ strains.

The Ttr$^{-}$ strains were subject to secondary screens to identify those mutants in which the lesion specifically affects tetrathionate respiration. Mutants that had a Ttr$^{-}$ phenotype as a consequence of a pleiotropic molybdopterin cofactor deficiency were identified by their resistance to chlorate, which, in cofactor-producing cells, would be metabolized to toxic chlorite by the molybdopterin-containing enzyme nitrate reductase (Stewart and MacGregor, 1982). Mutant strains were also screened for a functional thiosulphate reduction pathway (Phs$^{+}$) using peptone iron agar plates. This test was used to assess whether the Ttr$^{-}$ phenotypes represented generalized, possibly regulatory, defects in which subsequent steps in the thionate reduction pathway are also affected. Seven of the Ttr$^{-}$ strains were chlorate resistant and Phs$^{-}$ (thiosulphate reductase is a molybdoenzyme) and were assumed to have defects in molybdopterin cofactor biosynthesis. The two remaining strains, BCB4 and BCB6, were chlorate sensitive and Phs$^{+}$ and were analysed in more detail.

Mutant strains BCB4 and BCB6 are incapable of reducing tetrathionate when cultured anaerobically on a complex, fermentable carbon source (Table 2). In contrast, the parental strain LT2a shows stoichiometric conversion of tetrathionate to thiosulphate while tetrathionate is in excess (Table 2). The parental strain LT2a, but neither BCB4 nor BCB6, can grow anaerobically on minimal medium containing glycerol as the non-fermentable carbon source and tetrathionate as the sole respiratory electron acceptor. These results confirm that BCB4 and BCB6 are completely defective in physiological tetrathionate reduction.

To ascertain whether strains BCB4 and BCB6 lack the enzyme tetrathionate reductase, we directly assayed the activity of the reductase using dithionite-reduced methyl viologen radical as a non-physiological electron donor (see Experimental procedures). The rationale for this assay is that viologen radicals are capable of donating electrons directly to the catalytic site of molybdopterin-dependent enzymes (e.g. McEwan et al., 1991; Guigliarelli et al., 1996). We found that strains BCB4 and BCB6 retain only about 10% of the viologen-linked tetrathionate reductase activity of the parental strain (Table 2). Subsequent genetic analysis of the Ttr system (below) confirms that this residual activity is not associated with the tetrathionate respiratory pathway. It has been reported that the thiosulphate reductase of *P.* mirabilis exhibits viologen-linked tetrathionate reductase activity (Oltmann et al., 1974). To test whether the residual viologen-linked tetrathionate reductase activity in mutant strains BCB4 and BCB6 was due to thiosulphate reductase, a *phs* mutation was moved into BCB4 and BCB6. No change in viologen-linked tetrathionate reductase activity was observed in the resultant double mutants (Table 2). Thus, under the growth conditions used, thiosulphate reductase does not contribute significantly to the total methyl viologen-linked tetrathionate reductase activity.

tetrathionate reduction found in the BCB4 and BCB6 strains indicate that these strains cannot form a functional tetra-  
thionate reductase enzyme.

Mapping of transposon insertions in mutants defective in tetrathionate respiration

The approximate chromosomal locations of the transposon insertions in mutants BCB4 and BCB6 were established using the Benson and Goldman Mud-P22 prophage mapping set (Benson and Goldman, 1992). The insertions in both mutants were complemented by phages from strain TT15244 in which DNA is packaged clockwise from *aroD*. *aroD* is located at centisome 30.5 on the current *S.* typhi-  
murium genetic map (Sanderson *et al.*, 1996). The transpo-  
sons in BCB4 and BCB6 co-transduced with the TT15244 *aroD* marker at frequencies of 21% (BCB6) and 0.5% (BCB4). From these frequencies it can be inferred (Sander-  
son and Roth, 1988) that the transposon insertions are  
≈12 kb (BCB6) and 24 kb (BCB4) clockwise from *aroD*.  
*Salmonella typhimurium* possesses a 40 kb insertion between centisomes 30 and 31 relative to the equivalent chromosomal region in *Escherichia coli* K-12 (Shea *et al.*, 1996; Hensel *et al.*, 1997a). A large portion of this insertion codes for virulence functions and this locus is designated *Salmonella* pathogenicity island 2 (SPI2) (Hensel *et al.*, 1997b). A 13 kb region at the centisome 30 boundary of SPI2 has not been characterized in detail. This region can be inferred to start around 20 kb clockwise from *aroD* (Blattner *et al.*, 1997; Hensel *et al.*, 1997a). Given that the *ttr* mutations and the 30 cs boundary of SPI2 are closely linked to *aroD*, and that *E. coli* lacks both SPI2 and the ability to respire tetrathionate, it was likely that *ttr* is located in

the SPI2 boundary region. The sequencing and characterization of the 30 cs region of SPI2 was therefore undertaken. Here the identification and characterization of open reading frames required for tetrathionate respiration is reported. Characterization of the remainder of the region sequenced together with evolutionary and pathogenicity aspects is detailed elsewhere (Hensel *et al.*, 1999). The sequence can be accessed at the EMBL database using accession number AJ224978.

Identification of genes required for tetrathionate respiration

On the basis of their derived amino acid sequences five possible open reading frames in the region sequenced were tentatively assigned a function in tetrathionate respira- tion (Fig. 1). Three of the open reading frames (ORFs) code for the α-, β- and γ-subunits of a membrane-bound MGD- containing enzyme, putatively tetrathionate reductase, and were designated *ttrA*, *ttrB* and *ttrC* respectively. In enzymes of this type the α-subunit is an extrinsic mem- brane protein containing the MGD active site, the β-subunit is an extrinsic membrane protein binding iron-sulphur clusters, whereas the γ-subunit is an integral membrane protein that acts to anchor the other subunits to the mem- brane and carries the site of interaction with the membrane quinone pool. The order of the Ttr structural genes, *ttrBCA*, is unusual: there is only one other case in which the gene for the β-subunit does not directly follow that coding for the α-subunit (open reading frames af0157–0159 in Klenk *et al.*, 1997). There is no intergenic gap between *ttrB* and *ttrC*, whereas *ttrA* and *ttrC* overlap by 8 bp. This suggests that *ttrBCA* are translationally coupled and form an operon.

Two open reading frames upstream, and divergently transcribed from, $t t r B C A$ code for the sensor and response regulator of a two-component transcriptional regulatory system (Hoch and Silhavy, 1995). This genetic organization is typical of regulators controlling a structural gene operon, and so a function of these open reading frames in regulation of tetrahydrogenate reductase expression was anticipated. The genes for the sensor and response regulator, designated $t t r S$ and $t t r R$, respectively, overlap by 26 bp, suggesting that the two genes form an operon.

We identified the sites of the transposon insertions in the Ttr$^{-}$ mutant strains BCB4 and BCB6. The transposon in the BCB4 strain is inserted at nucleotide 777 of $t t r S$ and that in BCB6 at nucleotide 3002 of $t t r A$ (Fig. 1). These observations provide experimental evidence that the $t t r$ genes identified by sequence inspection are involved in tetrahydrogenate respiration. They also show that a Ttr$^{-}$ phenotype can arise from insertions in either the $t t r B C A$ or $t t r S R$ units. We constructed a second $t t r S$ mutant (strain MvP256) in which transcriptional readthrough from the antibiotic resistance gene of an inserted marker cassette would allow $t t r R$ expression. This mutant has the same Ttr$^{-}$ phenotype as strain BCB4 ($t t r S::T n 10$) (Table 2), demonstrating that the Ttr$^{-}$ phenotype of the transposon mutant is not solely a consequence of a failure to transcribe $t t r R$. Similar 'non-polar' insertional mutagenesis of $t t r B$ (strain MvP257) also produced a Ttr$^{-}$ phenotype (Table 2), indicating that

TtrB, a protein with an apparent electron transfer rather than catalytic function, is required for a functional tetrahydrogenate reductase.

A plasmid (pAH26) bearing only $t t r R S B C A$ confers on $E$. coli the ability to synthesize tetrahydrogenate reductase and to respire tetrahydrogenate (Table 2). This plasmid also confers on $E$. coli the ability to grow anaerobically on tetrahydrogenate-containing minimal media with glycerol as the sole carbon source. These observations indicate that additional genes at the centisome 30.5 locus are not required for tetrahydrogenate respiration. In agreement with this observation mutants with insertions in orf242 (MvP256) or the ssa, ssc, sse or ssr clusters of SPI2 virulence genes (Hensel et al., 1997b; Hensel et al., 1999) remain Ttr$^{+}$ (not shown). A plasmid (p1-7) bearing only $t t r B C A$ is able to complement $S$. typhimurium $t t r A$ and $t t r B$ mutants but does not produce a Ttr$^{+}$ phenotype in $E$. coli (Table 2). This confirms that expression of functional tetrahydrogenate reductase requires the TtrSR two-component regulatory system. We conclude that $t t r R S B C A$ constitute the $t t r$ locus of $S$. typhimurium.

The accuracy of the $t t r$ ORF assignments was assessed by independently expressing $t t r B C A o r f 408$ and $t t r S R$ from a T7 promoter element (Fig. 2 and Table 3). Polypeptides of masses appropriate for TtrA, TtrB, TtrR and Orf408 could be identified. A protein corresponding to the highly hydrophobic TtrC protein could not be clearly identified

those enzymes with similar substrates ('Segment III' of Berks *et al.*, 1995). This sequence region can therefore be used as a fingerprint for the catalytic specificity of the enzyme. Examination of the crystal structures of MGD-binding proteins (Schindelin *et al.*, 1996; Boyington *et al.*, 1997) suggests a structural basis for this sequence specificity correlation. The polypeptide region contributes a relatively large number of residues to the enzyme active site pocket and substrate access channel including an amino acid ligand (serine, selenocysteine or cysteine) to the molybdenum atom of the cofactor. Currently, three functional groupings are recognized for this specificity region. These are the S- and N-oxide reductases, the formate dehydrogenases and soluble nitrate reductases, and the membrane-bound nitrate reductases (Berks *et al.*, 1995). On the basis of the alignments in Fig. 4, it is proposed that a fourth specificity grouping can be defined that contains *S.* typhimurium thiosulphate reductase and the polysulphide reductase of *W.* succinogenes. Close inspection indicates that TtrA also belongs to this grouping. This suggests that the catalytic mechanism of tetrathionate reductase may be related to that of thiosulphate and polysulphide reductases. On the basis of this inferred mechanistic similarity, we propose that the function of the molybdopterin cofactor in the three enzymes is to cleave reductively a sulphur-sulphur bond. As noted in the introduction, such a catalytic reaction would represent a previously unrecognized activity of the molybdopterin cofactor in biology.

Sequence similarity in the specificity-defining region can be further used to propose possible candidates for the amino acid ligand to the molybdenum atom of the MGD cofactor. We suggest that for the sulphur-sulphur reductases a conserved cysteine residue, Cys-256 in TtrA, is the molybdenum ligand (Fig. 4)

TtrA shows significantly higher sequence identity (32.8%) to the product of open reading frame AF0159 of the archaeal hyperthermophilic sulphate-reducer *Archaeoglobus fulgidus* (Klenk *et al.*, 1997) than it does to other MGD-binding proteins. Like *ttrA*, AF0159 is transcribed

Sequence analysis of the MGD-binding protein TtrA

The N-terminal region of the TtrA precursor protein contains a sequence (T-R-R-x-x-L-K) with high similarity to the consensus motif (S/T-R-R-x-F-L-K) of twin-arginine transfer peptides (Fig. 3A; Berks, 1996). Such transfer peptides function to direct Sec-independent export of periplasmically located proteins binding cofactors including the molybdopterin cofactor (Berks, 1996; Santini *et al.*, 1998; Weiner *et al.*, 1998; Sargent *et al.*, 1998). A twin-arginine transfer sequence suggests that TtrA, and hence the site of tetra-thionate reduction, is located at the periplasmic side of the membrane.

Immediately after the putative transfer sequence of TtrA, there is a cluster of four cysteine residues. These cysteine residues are conserved in many other MGD-binding proteins and in two cases have been shown to bind a [4Fe-4S] cluster (Breton *et al.*, 1994; Boyington *et al.*, 1997). It is therefore probable that TtrA binds a [4Fe-4S] cluster. The most likely function of this cluster is to mediate electron transfer from the iron-sulphur clusters in TtrB to the MGD cofactor at the active site.

Analysis of MGD-binding polypeptides has identified a region that exhibits sequence similarity only between

Comparative alignment of the predicted twin-arginine transfer peptide of (A) TtrA with those found on a selection of other MGD-binding proteins (B) TtrB with other '16Fe ferredoxins', which have, or are proposed to have, twin-arginine transfer peptides. The twin-arginine consensus motif is (S/T)-R-R-x-F-L-K, where the arginine residues are invariant (Berks, 1996). Amino acids corresponding to the consensus motif are indicated in bold. Sites of leader peptidase processing are experimentally determined (EX) or predicted (SP) by the program SIGNALP (Nielsen et al., 1997). SWISSPROT database accession numbers for the proteins shown are SP TREMBL O30078 (A. fulgidus AF0159), P18775 (E. coli DmsA; N-terminus reassigned according to Berks, 1996), SP TREMBL P77374 (E. coli O808a), SP TREMBL P77783 (E. coli O808b), P37600 (S. typhimurium PhsA), P31075 (W. succinogenes PsrA), SP TREMBL O30286 (A. fulgidus AF2384), P33225 (E. coli TorA), P46923 (E. coli BisZ), P24183 (E. coli FdnG), P32176 (E. coli FdoG), P33937 (E. coli NapA), SP TREMBL O29751 (A. fulgidus AF0499), P32708 (E. coli NrfC), P45015 (H. influenzae NrfC), SP TREMBL P77375 (E. coli F239), P33389 (D. vulgaris HmcB) and P37179 (E. coli HybA).

after the genes coding for the ferredoxin and integral membrane protein subunits of the enzyme. Further, the AF0159 gene product resembles TtrA in possessing an N-terminal twin-arginine transfer sequence (Fig. 3A) and the two proteins have sequence similarity in the specificity-determining region (Fig. 4). It is therefore possible that the AF0159 gene product is the catalytic subunit of an archaeal tetra-thionate reductase.

**TtrB analysis**

TtrB is a member of a large family of proteins binding four [4Fe–4S] clusters ('16Fe ferredoxins'; Berks et al., 1995). All the cysteines that act as the iron-sulphur cluster ligands are conserved in TtrB. The TtrB iron-sulphur clusters probably function to transfer electrons from TtrC to TtrA. The N-terminus of TtrB has sequence similarity to the known (Keon and Voordouw, 1996) or predicted twin-arginine transfer peptides of other 16Fe-ferredoxins (Fig. 3B). The putative TtrB transfer peptide departs from the twin-arginine consensus motif by substituting a lysine residue for the first of the two totally conserved arginines of the motif. The limited experimental evidence available suggests that such a substitution would drastically impair the ability of the transfer peptide to direct export by the Sec-independent pathway (Nivière et al., 1992; Chaddock et al., 1995). To exclude the possibility that this substitution is a cloning artefact, the ttrB region was amplified from the S. typhimurium chromosome and the sequence confirmed. Several possibilities exist to explain the lysine for arginine substitution in what appears to be a twin-arginine transfer peptide. It is conceivable, but unlikely, that the sequence similarity between the N-terminus of TtrB and the twin-arginine transfer peptides of 16Fe-ferredoxins (Fig. 3B) is coincidental. It is possible that the requirement for the first arginine in the consensus sequence is relaxed in the context of the TtrB signal sequence. Finally, as it is proposed that export of the 16Fe-ferredoxin subunits of MGD-dependent enzymes is normally mediated by the transfer peptide on the MGD-binding subunit (Berks, 1996), the N-terminus of TtrB may represent a degenerating evolutionary relic, the function of which has been superseded by the TtrA transfer peptide.

**TtrC analysis**

TtrC is predicted to be an integral membrane protein containing nine transmembrane helices (amino acids 22–40,

Fig. 4. The polypeptide region of MGD-dependent enzymes providing a ligand to the molybdenum atom ('Segment III' of Berks *et al.*, 1995). These fingerprint regions of representative MGD enzymes are displayed in substrate specificity groups. The secondary structure assignments for the S- and N-oxide reductases and for the formate dehydrogenase/soluble nitrate reductase groupings are taken from the crystal structures of *R. sphaeroides* DmsA (Schindelin *et al.*, 1996) and *E. coli* FdhF (Boyington *et al.*, 1997) respectively. For the reductases cleaving sulphur–sulphur bonds the secondary structure predictions are those of the program PHD (Rost and Sander, 1994) at the nominal 72% confidence level. The molybdenum ligand, or proposed molybdenum ligand, is shown in bold. Residues in *R. sphaeroides* DmsA involved in forming the active site or substrate channel are indicated by +. PhsA is the catalytic subunit of *S. typhimurium* thiosulphate reductase. PsrA is the catalytic subunit of *Wolinella succinogenes* polysulphide reductase. SWISSPROT database accession numbers for the proteins shown are as in Fig. 3 with the addition of P20099 (*E. coli* BisC), Q57366 (*R. sphaeroides* DmsA) and P07658 (*E. coli* FdhF). The membrane-bound nitrate reductase specificity grouping is not shown as it is not crystallographically defined and does not exhibit sequence similarity to the sulphur–sulphur bond reductases in this region.

58–77, 94–112, 132–156, 161–182, 200–215, 230–253, 267–287 and 309–327) with a topological organization that places the N-terminus of the protein in the periplasm. TtrC exhibits statistically significant sequence similarity to the AF2386 gene product of *A. fulgidus* (Klenk *et al.*, 1997), which in turn shows statistically significant sequence similarity to the PsrC protein of *W. succinogenes* polysulphide reductase (Krafft *et al.*, 1992) and the NrfD proteins of the periplasmic nitrite reductase systems of *E. coli* and *Haemophilus influenzae* (Hussain *et al.*, 1994; Fleischmann *et al.*, 1995). A small C-terminal extension in TtrC relative to the other proteins of the PsrC/NrfD/AF2386 family is predicted to contain an extra transmembrane helix. PsrC and NrfD most likely function to oxidize menaquinol with the electrons passing to periplasmically located 16Fe-ferredoxins (Krafft *et al.*, 1992; Hussain *et al.*, 1994; Berks *et al.*, 1995; Tyson *et al.*, 1997; Hedderich *et al.*, 1999). By analogy we propose that TtrC transfers electrons from membrane quinol to TtrB bound at its periplasmic face. In this context it is notable that the regions of highest sequence similarity between Ttr and the PsrC/NrfD family proteins

are all found at the periplasmic ends of the predicted trans-membrane helices. An arginine residue (Arg-280 in TtrC) towards the periplasmic end of proposed helix eight is the only invariant charged residue predicted to be buried in the membrane bilayer and could be involved in the quinol oxidation reaction. There are no conserved histidines among the TtrC/PsrC/NrfD family proteins that could provide haem iron axial ligands. We therefore predict that TtrC does not bind haem, a proposal that is consistent with a report that haem-deficient *S. typhimurium* mutants are still able to respire tetrathionate (Barrett and Clark, 1987).

Regulation of Ttr synthesis

TtrS and TtrR have the standard domain organization of two-component transcriptional regulators. The response regulator TtrR and the C-terminal signal kinase domain of the TtrS sensor protein have highest sequence similarity to the FixJL subfamily of two-component regulators. However, the N-terminal stimulus-receiving domain of TtrS shows no sequence similarity to other proteins. Although

this sensing domain probably ends in a transmembrane helix, an unambiguous topological model for the remainder of the domain could not be derived from the sequence.

The complementation experiments described above and in Table 2 show that TtrSR are required for formation of functional tetrathionate reductase and sequence analysis of TtrSR indicates that these proteins are most likely to be involved in control of *ttrBCA* transcription. To test this idea *ttrB* transcript levels were measured in cells grown anaerobically in the presence of tetrathionate (Fig. 5A). A single transcript starting 81 basepairs before the *ttrB* start codon was detected in the parental S. typhimurium strain (Fig. 5A, lane 1) and in E. coli carrying a plasmid bearing the full *ttrRSBCA* locus (Fig. 5A, lane 5). However, no transcript was detectable in an S. typhimurium *ttrS* mutant (Fig. 5A, lane 2) or in E. coli containing a plasmid bearing the *ttrBCA* and not the *ttrRS* genes (Fig. 5A, lane 4). These experiments demonstrate that the TtrSR system is absolutely required for *ttrB* transcription. Two-component transcriptional regulators interact with σ⁷⁰-containing RNA polymerase. Reasonable –10 and –35 sequences for a σ⁷⁰-dependent promoter are present upstream of the *ttrB* transcriptional start site (Fig. 5B), suggesting that direct regulation of the *ttrB* promoter by TtrSR is plausible.

Tetrathionate reductase expression is induced by its substrate (Pollock and Knox, 1943) and the TtrSR system is an obvious candidate for the tetrathionate-sensing pathway. Additional environmental factors may also contribute to the control of Ttr expression, most notably a requirement for anaerobiosis (Barrett and Clark, 1987). Oxygen sensing in enteric bacteria is usually mediated by the Fnr global transcriptional regulator. An S. typhimurium strain carrying an *fnr* (formerly *oxrA*) mutation was unable to respire tetrathionate or produce viologen-linked tetrathionate reductase activity (Table 2), indicating that Fnr is required for Ttr expression. Tetrathionate respiratory activity was not restored by growing the strain in the presence of formate (Table 2), demonstrating that Fnr is not regulating Ttr expression indirectly by affecting formate production. A sequence with high (9 out of 10 bases) similarity to the consensus Fnr binding site TTGATxxxxATCAA is centred at –71.5 relative to the *ttrB* transcriptional start site (Fig. 5B). Fnr binding sites are normally centred at –41.5 relative to the transcriptional start site forming class II promoters at which both subunits of the Fnr homodimer interact with RNA polymerase. However, experiments with synthetic promoters have established that Fnr is also able to function at sites further upstream of the transcriptional start, including at –71 (Wing et al., 1995). In these cases class I promoters are formed in which only the downstream subunit of Fnr binds to the RNA polymerase. Naturally occurring class I Fnr-activated promoters have recently been identified for the E. coli *napF* (Darwin et al.,

Alternatively, the Fnr binding site in the *ttrS/ttrB* intergenic region could be involved in regulating *ttrS* expression. Note, however, that if the Fnr binding site is positioned at –41.5 relative to the *ttrS* transcript start the *ttrS* promoter lacks recognizable RNA polymerase –10 and –35 binding sites.

**Occurrence of ttr genes**

We tested representative strains of all *S. enterica/S. bongori* subspecies in the SARC reference collection (Boyd et al., 1996) and found them to be both Ttr+ (data not shown) and to exhibit hybridization between their chromosomal DNA and *ttrA*, *ttrC* and *ttrS* probes (Hensel et al., 1999). The ability to respire tetrathionate is therefore likely to be significant within the life cycle of *Salmonella* spp. Initial studies indicate that an inability to respire tetrathionate does not significantly affect the virulence of *S. typhimurium* in mice (Hensel et al., 1999). Tetrathionate respiration may therefore be most important when the bacterium is in the free living state in tetrathionate-containing environments such as soil or decomposing carcasses.

In conclusion, we have reported the first genetic identification of a tetrathionate-reducing system together with a two-component regulatory system required for its synthesis. The genetic characterization described will provide a basis for future biochemical, bioenergetic and regulatory studies of this important respiratory pathway.

P22-mediated transductions were performed as detailed in Maloy et al. (1996) using P22 HT int. Marked Ttr-defective

mutants were selected using the transposase-defective tetra-
cycle-resistant mini-transposon Tn10Δ16Δ17 (Way *et al.*, 1984). A pool of random mutations was constructed in strain TT10427 (which contains a plasmid overexpressing Tn10 transposase) by transducing to tetracycline resistance with a P22 lysate grown on the mini-Tn10-containing strain TT10423. A fresh P22 lysate prepared on the pool of cells with mini-Tn10 insertions was then used to transduce strain LT2a, and transductants were screened directly for the Ttr phenotype on tetracycline-containing EMB-tetrathionate plates. Linkage of insertion and the Ttr⁻ phenotype was confirmed by transduction into a fresh LT2a background. Rapid mapping of the *ttr*::Tn10 insertions was carried out using the Benson and Goldman excision-defective Mud-P22 prophage set (Benson and Goldman, 1992) using EMB-tetrathionate agar to ascertain the Ttr phenotype.

### DNA techniques

Standard recombinant DNA techniques were as described by Sambrook *et al.* (1989). The *ttr* locus was sequenced using subclones from phage λ1 (Shea *et al.*, 1996) predominantly by a primer-walking strategy. The sequencing reactions were run on an ABI 377 sequencer and assembled using the programs ASSEMBLYLIGN and MACVECTOR (Oxford). All regions were sequenced at least twice on each strand.

Sequence analysis used the University of Wisconsin Genetics Computing Group package (Version 8.1) with the GCGEMBL extension (Version 8.1.0) (Devereux *et al.*, 1984) and the BLAST server at the NCBI (Altschul *et al.*, 1990). Sequence similarities were regarded as indicating definite structural similarity, and designated ‘statistically significant’ in the main text, if pairwise alignment of the sequences provides a binary comparison score at least nine standard deviations greater than that of randomized sequences of the same amino acid composition (Marger and Saier, 1993). The presence of leader peptidase sites was assessed using the program SIGNALP version 1.1 (Nielsen *et al.*, 1997). The presence, location and topological organization of potential transmembrane helical regions was assessed for single sequences by the program DAS (Cserzo *et al.*, 1997) in combination with the positive-inside rule (von Heijne, 1992), and for multiple alignments of homologous proteins by the programs TMAP (Persson and Argos, 1994) and PHD (Rost *et al.*, 1996). When predictions from multiple methods were available, the predictions were in complete agreement.

The location of the mini-transposon insertions was determined by directly sequencing the specific product of PCR reactions using a Tn10-specific primer (5′-AAGGATCCTTGGTCACCAACGCTTTTCCC-3′ or 5′-GGAATTGATTGCTGT TGACAAAGGGAATC-3′) and one of a panel of *ttr*-specific primers.

Directed *ttr* mutations were constructed by inserting a kanamycin resistance gene lacking a transcriptional terminator (the *aphT* cassette of Galan *et al.*, 1992) in the same orientation as the *Salmonella* gene. These constructs allow expression of genes downstream of the insertion site. For the *ttrB* mutation the *aphT* cassette was inserted in the EcoRV site of *ttrB* and for the *orf242* mutation in the HindII site of *orf242*. For the *ttrS* mutation, a HindII fragment of 117 bp was deleted within *ttrS* and replaced by the *aphT* cassette.

The disrupted genes were cloned into the λ*pir*-dependent suicide vector pKAS32 (Skorupski and Taylor, 1996) and resulting constructs were electroporated into *E. coli* S17-1 λ*pir* (de Lorenzo and Timmis, 1994). Plasmids were then conjugationally transferred from *E. coli* S17-1 λ*pir* to *S. typhimurium* MvP100 (*Strep*⁺) by filter matings. Recipients that had integrated the suicide vector were selected by resistance to kanamycin and chloramphenicol. Subsequently, clones that had undergone replacement of wild-type alleles by alleles disrupted by the *aphT* cassette were enriched by culturing in LB containing 250 μg ml⁻¹ streptomycin as previously described (Skorupski and Taylor, 1996). The positions of the *aphT* cassettes were confirmed by Southern hybridization analysis of total DNA of exconjugants, and the insertions were transferred to LT2a-derived backgrounds by P22-mediated transduction.

Plasmid pAH26 was constructed by blunt-ending the BbsI fragment bearing *ttrSRBCA'* and cloning this into HincII-cut pSU41 then replacing the fragment of the resultant plasmid extending from the *PstI* site in *ttrS* through *ttrBCA'* to the *EcoRI* site of the multiple cloning site by the *ttrS'BCA PstI/EcoRI* fragment from p1-7. Plasmid p1-7-T7 for T7-dependent expression was constructed by subcloning the 7.5 kb *SalI/NotI* fragment of p1-7 in pET21(+). For the construction of plasmid *pttrSR-T7*, PCR was performed using primers *ttrS*-For (5′-TCCATATTGACTCCCGTCC-3′) and *ttrR*-Rev (5′-ACTTTT-TACTCGCCAG-3′). The resulting product of 2.5 kb was cloned in pT7-Blue using the PerfectlyBlunt cloning system (Novagen), and the insert was subsequently transferred to pET21(+). Plasmids in which *ttrSR* were transcribed from the T7 promoter were identified by restriction analysis and transferred to BL21(DE3).

Total RNA was isolated from cultures grown to mid-exponential phase, and primer extension analysis was carried out as described by Sawers and Böck (1989). Analysis of the *ttrB* transcription start site was performed with oligonucleotide Ttrb-1 (5′-CCAAGCTGCTGGAGAAATTGCC-3′) and the DNA sequence ladder was generated using pAH26 as template (Sanger *et al.*, 1977).

### Analytical methods

Tetrathionate reduction was assessed in cells cultured according to a standard protocol. LB was inoculated with 1% concentration of an overnight culture of aerobically grown cells. The cells were then cultured anoxically until mid-logarithmic phase (*A*₆₀₀ = 0.3), 30 mM potassium tetrathionate was added to the culture, and growth continued for another 2.5 h. After 2.5 h cells were pelleted by centrifugation. The tetrathionate and thiosulphate concentrations in the supernatant were determined, while the pelleted cells were washed three times in ice-cold 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.4 and then assayed for methyl viologen-linked tetrathionate reductase activity. Culture on a fermentable carbon source allowed analysis of strains with defects in tetrathionate respiration. However, on such media induction of tetrathionate reductase varied somewhat with the growth phase, hence the adoption of a standardized induction protocol.

Tetrathionate and thiosulphate concentrations were determined by cyanolysis according to the protocols of Kelly and Wood (1994). Methyl viologen-linked tetrathionate reduction

was measured by a modification of the nitrate reductase assay of Bell *et al.* (1990). Assays were carried out in glass cuvettes, sealed with a butyl rubber stopper and rendered anoxic by bubbling with oxygen-free nitrogen. The assay solution contained 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.4, 2 mM Na₂EDTA and 1 mM methyl viologen. The methyl viologen was reduced by titration with a freshly prepared solution of sodium dithionite (≈50 mM) in 100 mM sodium pyrophosphate pH 9.0 until A₆₀₀ = 1.5. The reaction was started by the addition of 500 μM potassium tetrathionate and oxidation of methyl viologen radical was monitored at 600 nm (Δε₆₀₀nm [MV⁺⁺-MV²⁺] = 13 mM⁻¹ cm⁻¹). All assays had to be corrected for the rate of chemical reduction of tetrathionate by the methyl viologen radical.

Protein concentrations were determined using the bicinchoninic acid method of Smith *et al.* (1985) with bovine serum albumin (Cohn Fraction V) as the standard. We found that tetrathionate and thiosulphate interfere with this method of protein determination at nanomolar concentrations. Protein concentrations for cells grown in the presence of these compounds were therefore inferred from A₆₀₀ measurements of cell density using a calibration curve of protein concentration versus A₆₀₀ determined for cells grown in the absence of thionates.

Analysis and ³⁵S-labelling of proteins expressed under the control of the T7 promoter was performed essentially as described before (Tabor and Richardson, 1985). Cells were grown to mid-log phase, expression was induced by addition of 1 mM IPTG for 30 min, and proteins were radiolabelled for 5 min by the addition of 20 μCi [³⁵S]-methionine/[³⁵S]-cysteine (Promix). Bacteria from 1 ml of culture were pelleted, resuspended in 100 μl of electrophoresis sample buffer (12.5% glycerol, 4% SDS, 2% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.01% bromophenol blue, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8) and boiled for 5 min. Samples (20 μl) were subjected to SDS–PAGE on 12% polyacrylamide gels with a Tris-tricine buffer system (Schägger and von Jagow, 1987).
