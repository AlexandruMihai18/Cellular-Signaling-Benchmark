Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a form of dementia in which patients develop neurodegeneration and complete loss of cognitive abilities and die prematurely. No treatment is known for this condition. Evidence points toward β-amyloid as one of the main causes for cytotoxic processes. The cascade of biochemical events that lead to neuronal death appears to be interference with intracellular calcium homeostasis via activation of calcium channels, intracellular calcium stores, and subsequent production of free radicals by calcium-sensitive enzymes. The glutamatergic system seems to be implicated in mediating the toxic processes. Several strategies promise amelioration of neurodegenerative developments as judging from *in vitro* experiments. Glutamate receptor-selective drugs, antioxidants, inhibitors of nitric oxide synthase, calcium channel antagonists, receptor or enzyme inhibitors, and growth factors promise help. Especially combinations of drugs that act at different levels might prolong patients’ health.

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a form of dementia that invariably leads to complete loss of all cognitive abilities and premature death. No treatment is known for this condition. In the United States, a community-based study has suggested that approximately 4 million people have AD (Evans *et al.*, 1989). The prevalence of AD is 3% for persons 65–74 years old, 18.7% for those 75–84 years old, and 47.2% for those over 85 years old (Katzman, 1976). With the aging of society it has been estimated that approximately 9 million individuals in the United States could develop AD by the year 2040, unless preventive strategies are found (National Institute on Aging, 1995).

The main symptoms for AD are the presence of senile plaques, silver positive neurofibrillary tangles (NFT), and prominent cortical neuron loss. The causes for these developments are still not entirely understood even though a considerable amount of detailed knowledge has accumulated over the past 30 years.

Currently, drugs used to treat AD strategies act mainly on the acetylcholine neurotransmitter system, such as the acetylcholine esterase inhibitors Tacrine, Velnacrine, or Aricept, since it was believed until recently that the main cause for AD is a degeneration of basal brain nuclei that use acetylcholine as a neurotransmitter (Gooch and Stennett, 1996; Shintani and Uchida, 1997). These drugs only show limited effect (Weiner, 1997) and it is possible that upregulation of a degenerating system might speed up neurotoxic processes. Activation of acetylcholinergic neurons increases the release of amyloid precursor molecules (Nitsch *et al.*, 1992) and could increase production of β-amyloid. However, focus of research has shifted over the years toward glutamatergic neurodegeneration which appears to explain the physiological and anatomical hallmarks of AD better (Masliah *et al.*, 1996; Braak and Braak, 1997; Arendt *et al.*, 1998).

I. THE PHYSIOLOGICAL ROLE  
OF AMYLOID PROTEINS  

**Genesis of β-Amyloid**

The source of β-amyloid is a family of amyloid precursor proteins (APP) that arise by alternative splicing of a primary APP gene transcript. APPs are membrane-spanning glycoproteins and appear to serve primarily as cell adhesion molecules. However, phosphorylation sites and binding sites to G proteins on the intracellular side have been described which suggests that APPs can act as receptors (Nitsch and Growdon, 1994). The 770- and 751-amino-acid spliced versions of APP contain a Kunitz-type serine protease inhibitor, which probably regulates the degradation of APP (Edelberg and Wei, 1996). APP degradation occurs through two main pathways—the α/γ and the β/γ pathways. Cleavage of APP at amino acids 16 and 17 by α-secretase lies within the β-amyloid domain and therefore prevents β-amyloid production. A soluble APP fragment (sAPP) is produced which is further degraded by a γ-secretase. The second pathway involves a β-secretase which cleaves APP at an extracellular cleavage site and by a γ-secretase in the intramembrane domain which liberates the β-amyloid peptide (Greenberg et al., 1996) (see also Fig. 1).

The hatched bar represents the β-amyloid section of APP. The two pathways are shown with α-secretase cleaving the APP molecule within the β-amyloid domain, thus rendering β-amyloid formation impossible, and β-secretase cleaving APP at the extracellular end. The molecule is then cleaved further by γ-secretase. In the α-secretase pathway, cleavage by γ-secretase produces a small peptide of unknown function named p3. In the β-secretase pathway, cleavage by γ-secretase produces β-amyloid.

**Functional Roles of Amyloid Precursor Proteins**

The functions of APP molecules are not entirely clear. *In vitro* studies have shown that APP stimulates neurite outgrowth (Clarris et al., 1994; Small et al., 1996). Yet, mice strains with gene deletion that do not express APP develop remarkably few impairments or abnormalities (Zheng et al., 1996). However, several related molecules exist that have been termed APP-like proteins. Simultaneous deletion of genes for these proteins together with deletion of the APP gene produces profound effects such as gross developmental abnormalities (Tremml et al., 1997; von Koch et al., 1997). These results suggest that APP and APP-like proteins are of importance for development and that there is large redundancy in the functionality of these proteins (Sandbrink et al., 1996). APP also plays a role in regeneration and cell repair. APP has neuroprotective properties against acute and chronic cytotoxic influences (Mucke et al., 1996; Masliah et al., 1997). One can imagine that the protective and regenerative effect of APP is due to its enhancing effects on development and outgrowth.

APP is a membrane spanning glycoprotein and is ubiquitously expressed. It probably acts as cell adhesion or cell recognition molecules (Gillian et al., 1997) and membrane receptors (Nitsch and Growdon, 1994), soluble secreted fragments of APP having modulator- or transmitter-like properties. Soluble APP fragments can regulate cell proliferation (Mattson, 1995), promote neuronal survival (Barger et al., 1995; Masliah et al., 1997), and reduce intracellular Ca²⁺ influx (Mattson et al., 1993) and are released from presynaptic terminals in a neurotransmitter-like fashion (Buxbaum et al., 1992; Nitsch and Growdon, 1994). Membrane-bound APP or sAPP also appear to play a role in synaptic plasticity and learning (Doyle et al., 1990) as will be discussed later.

**Interaction Between β-Amyloid and Glutamate Receptor Activity**

The glutamatergic neurotransmitter system is intrinsically linked to processes of synaptic plasticity (Bliss and Collingridge, 1993) and learning (Maurice et al., 1996) and to neurotoxic events (Connop et al., 1995). Also, cellular damage in brains of patients with AD is found predominantly in areas that display synaptic plasticity in the mature brain (Arendt et al., 1998). It is therefore of interest to note that APP is expressed and localized on glutamatergic neurons (Ouimet et al., 1994) and that sAPP release is mediated by glutamatergic transmitter activity, since loss of glutamatergic

Review on Alzheimer's Disease

neurons and amnesia are among the hallmarks of AD (Braak and Braak, 1991; Incalzi *et al.*, 1995). A number of studies showed a functional interaction between glutamate receptor activation, release of sAPP, and β-amyloid-induced processes. Studies showed that NMDA receptor agonists increase the release of sAPP in cell cultures (Valerio *et al.*, 1995). sAPP in turn inhibited NMDA receptors and the NMDA receptor-dependent Ca²⁺ influx (Barger *et al.*, 1995), which explains in part the neuroprotective properties of sAPP and is most probably part of a negative-feedback mechanism. Metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) agonists increased secretion of sAPP in cell cultures. The increase in sAPP secretion was mimicked by direct activation of protein kinase C with phorbol ester or by the metabotropic glutamate receptor agonists L-(+)-2-amino-3-phosphonopropionic acid (L-AP3) and trans-(1S,3R)-1-amino-1,3-cyclopentane dicarboxylic acid (1S,3R-ACPD) (Lee and Wurtman, 1997; Ulus and Wurtman, 1997). Activating mGluRs with the agonist (2S,3S,4S)-alpha-(carboxycyclopropyl)-glycine (L-CCG-I) increased sAPP release (Kirazov *et al.*, 1997). Also, in cells transfected with mGluR mRNA, release of sAPP was stimulated by activation of mGluRs (Nitsch *et al.*, 1997).

The results suggest that during neuronal activation, sAPP is released from the presynaptic site to act as a modulator on the postsynaptic site.

While sAPP appears to have stabilizing and regenerating properties, β-amyloid has been found to induce cytotoxic effects.

of chromosome 21, the chromosome that contains the APP gene. Overexpression of APP mRNA in the brain has been confirmed in Down’s syndrome (Greenberg *et al.*, 1996). In other types of familial AD a majority of cases are linked to one or more genes on chromosome 21. It is striking that these contain APP mutations that are all missense changes flanking the β-amyloid processing domain, implying a role in altering the proteolytic chain of events that lead to the production of β-amyloid. A double mutation identified in two Swedish families changes the two amino acids immediately NH₂ terminal to this domain (Mullan *et al.*, 1993). Cells transfected with APP cDNAs harboring this mutation have been shown to secrete five- to eightfold higher levels of total β-amyloid peptide (Cai *et al.*, 1993).

The genetic linkage of late-onset AD with chromosome 19 has been mapped to a region containing a gene cluster for apolipoprotein E (APO E; Strittmatter *et al.*, 1993). Several allelic variations of APO E are known, named ε2, 3, and 4. APO E is associated with cholesterol transport and has affinity to lipid transporters. The APO ε4 variation has increased adhesion to β-amyloid. APO E is found in plaques as well and might cause precipitation (Gooch and Stennett, 1996). APO ε4 is linked to an increased risk of late-onset AD (Nicoll *et al.*, 1995; Blacker *et al.*, 1997) and has been shown to induce β-amyloid fibril formation *in vitro* (Wisniewski *et al.*, 1994). In contrast, APO ε2 antagonizes fibril formation (Ma *et al.*, 1994) and has been shown to be a protective factor against the development of AD (Corder *et al.*, 1994).

Also, mutations on gene S182 (presenilin 1) on chromosome 14 are linked to AD; 33 different cases with mutations on presenilin 1 have been identified. Another gene, E5–1 (presenilin 2) on chromosome 1, contains a missense mutation that leads to early onset of AD (Gooch and Stennett, 1996). The function of presenilin is not entirely clear but the gene has homologies to chromogranin A, a protein involved in protein secretion (Greenberg *et al.*, 1996; Xia *et al.*, 1997), and to Ca²⁺ channels (Guo *et al.*, 1996). It was reported that primary fibroblasts obtained from individuals harboring the chromosome 14 mutation also secrete elevated levels of β-amyloid (Suzuki *et al.*, 1994).

II. THE GENESIS OF ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE: THE β-AMYLOID HYPOTHESIS

Even though it is usually not advisable to propose a monocausal origin for complex syndromes such as AD, there is ample evidence that the formation of β-amyloid and precipitation into plaques are linked to the primary cause of AD.

Familial Inherited Types of AD

In familial inherited types of AD where the cause for the development of AD can be pinpointed to a defined gene locus, all known mutations affect directly or indirectly the processing and accumulation of β-amyloid. Individuals with Down’s syndrome invariably develop the biochemical and neuropathological hallmarks of AD by their fourth decade of life. Down’s syndrome results from partial or complete triplication

Transgenic Mouse Models

Several transgenic mouse models for AD have been developed in which APP is overexpressed or the processing of amyloid is altered. With this technique it has been made possible to test the theory of whether β-amyloid fragments can produce symptoms of AD
and are responsible at least in part for the neurodegeneration found in AD. In one study, transgenic mice that expressed the mutated human APP V717F developed symptoms of AD, such as plaques, synaptic loss, and astrocytosis. APP was overexpressed more than 10-fold. No obvious change in behavior or general appearance was seen at 4–6 months of age, but at 6–9 months amyloid deposits developed in the hippocampus, corpus callosum, and cerebral cortex. After 8 months, larger plaques were seen (30–200 μm in size), and the density of plaques increased after 9 months (Games *et al.*, 1995). In another study, transgenic mice that overexpressed mouse APP developed neurotoxic symptoms and 50% of these transgenic mice were dead after 12 months compared to 24 months in controls. Neurons that died displayed symptoms of apoptosis, and apoptotic cells were found especially in the hippocampus (LaFerla *et al.*, 1995). In another study, age-related CNS disorder and early death were observed in transgenic FVB/N mice that overexpressed human APP. The animals also displayed cognitive defects such as impairments in spatial learning (Hsiao *et al.*, 1995). It was further found that the level of β-amyloid in the CSF and the number of plaques in mice expressing human APP containing a Lys 670Asn, Met 671Leu mutation correlated with learning impairments at increasing age (Hsiao *et al.*, 1996). It is interesting to note that not all transgenic mouse strains display neurodegeneration even with high levels of β-amyloid found in the CSF. This could be due to the fact that mice rarely exceed 24 months of age, while neurodegenerative processes in brains of patients with AD develop over decades.

### Toxicity of β-Amyloid in Vitro and in Vivo

Further evidence for the theory that β-amyloid is the main cause for AD has been gathered from studies in which the effect of infused β-amyloid on neurons was tested.

In *in vitro* studies, infusion of β-amyloid produced neurotoxic effects in most but not all studies (Stein-Behrens *et al.*, 1992; Wujek *et al.*, 1996). The reason why some studies showed negative results was explained by the fact that the toxicity of β-amyloid is different from lot to lot. In one study, cell cultures of hippocampal cells were exposed to two different lots of (1-40) amyloid from the same supplier but produced contradicting effects. One lot proved to be toxic while the other did not (May *et al.*, 1992). In a similar cell culture study it was shown that the β-amyloid fragment (1-40) is toxic in human cortical cultures. Two different lots of β-amyloid (1-40) produced different results; one was toxic and formed amyloid aggregates, and the other did not aggregate and was nontoxic (Busciglio *et al.*, 1992). It had been observed before that aggregation of β-amyloid increases the toxic effect. β-Amyloid 1-28 is nontoxic and does not aggregate, while fragment 1-42 is more toxic in aggregated than unaggregated form (Pike *et al.*, 1991). The hypothesis that aggregation of amyloid fragments is required in order to obtain full neurotoxic effects has been followed up and confirmed by many researchers (Lorenzo and Yankner, 1996; Brinning *et al.*, 1997; Delobette *et al.*, 1997; Klein *et al.*, 1997).

Further *in vitro* studies showed that amyloid fragments are not necessarily toxic. Full toxicity was seen when neurons were already stressed and their self-regenerating powers were compromised. In one *in vitro* study the full toxic effect took 2–4 days to develop (Mattson and Rydel, 1992). Other studies do not allow that much time which might explain the lack of effects observed. Several studies investigated the neurotoxic effects of β-amyloid fragments that were of different lengths. β-Amyloid (1-40) was toxic in hippocampal slice cultures; preferably area CA3 neurons were shown to be vulnerable. Also, amyloid fibrils were formed in the cultured neurons (Harrigan *et al.*, 1995). β-Amyloid (1-40) or (25-35) also produced neurotoxic effects in other cell culture studies (Gray and Patel, 1995; Rush *et al.*, 1992).

In *vivo* studies also showed that infusion of β-amyloid is not always toxic. A study using Alzet osmotic minipumps infusing β-amyloid fragment (1-40), (1-38), or (25-35) into older rats (300–400 g) showed no damage at all (Games *et al.*, 1992). It has been shown that injection of soluble β-amyloid 1-40 but not β-amyloid 1-42 fragment produces aggregates *in vivo* (Shin *et al.*, 1997). The degree of actual aggregation could be a decisive factor for the neurotoxic effect of the amyloid fragments and also the ability of the living tissue to break down amyloid fragments or plaques. Since AD is developed fully in humans aged 40 years or older, it is easy to see that injections of amyloid fragments into a 6-month-old animal will not always produce similar results. However, neurotoxic effects were observed in most *in vivo* studies in which β-amyloid fragments were injected into the brain. In one study using rats or primates, intracortical injections of β-amyloid fragment (1-40) or (25-35) produced lesions (Kowall *et al.*, 1992). Additionally, it was found that β-amyloid aggregates injected into the brain *in vivo* produce similar neurodegeneration and neurite dystrophy in hippocampal cultured neurons to those seen in brains taken from AD patients (Pike *et al.*, 1991, 1992). In another study,
Review on Alzheimer's Disease

injection of aggregated β-amyloid 1-42 produced larger neurotoxic effects (Frautschy *et al.*, 1991), a result similar to the *in vitro* study by Pike *et al.* (1991, 1992). In another study, injection of β-amyloid fragment (1-40) or (25-35) also caused lesions, and plaques were seen 1 week after injection. Interestingly, the plaques did not remain permanently in the brain and were observed only up to 21 days (fragment 25-35) or 2 months (fragment 1-40) after injection (Giovanelli *et al.*, 1995).

The aggregation of β-amyloid in cell cultures was shown to be time dependent, with neural degeneration and presence of the protein following a similar time course. The extent of deposition of insoluble amyloid in AD correlates with the degree of neuronal damage, cognitive impairment, and memory loss (Mountjoy *et al.*, 1984).

Taken together, the evidence points toward β-amyloid fragments being primarily responsible for neurodegenerations seen in AD. The question remains how amyloid can induce such destructive effects. A number of factors have been identified that are linked to neurodegenerative processes.

### The Calcium Hypothesis

Ca²⁺ is an important second messenger that is involved in regulation of structural plasticity in neurons by influencing the cytoskeleton and associated proteins. It activates a number of Ca²⁺-sensitive proteins such as PKC, CaM kinase II, and nitric oxide synthase. β-Amyloid has profound effects on cellular Ca²⁺ homeostasis. While sAPP reduces intracellular Ca²⁺ levels and acts neuroprotective (Barger *et al.*, 1995; Mattson, 1994), β-amyloid fragments increase intracellular Ca²⁺ levels via several mechanisms. In neuronal cell cultures, β-amyloid fragments (1-40, 1-38, and 25-35) caused an increase of intracellular Ca²⁺ 6 h to several days after perfusion. Infusion of fibroblast growth factor reduced loss of this Ca²⁺ homeostasis. Aggregation of amyloid had a larger toxic effect on cells in this study too (Mattson *et al.*, 1993). One mechanism for increasing Ca²⁺ levels is the activation of intracellular Ca²⁺ stores by the inositol phosphates IP₃ and IP₄. β-Amyloid fragments (1-40 and 25-35) bind to IP₃ and IP₄. The affinity of amyloid fragment (25-35) to IP₄ is very high (Cowburn *et al.*, 1995) and amyloids could affect intracellular Ca²⁺ levels this way. β-Amyloid (25-35) stimulates phospholipases A, C, and D in cell cultures, enzymes which are Ca²⁺ dependent (Singh *et al.*, 1995).

Aggregated β-amyloid appears to act as Ca²⁺ channels in cell membranes. β-Amyloid (25-35) produced leaks in membranes, and cells became permeable for K⁺, Ca²⁺, Na⁺, and organic molecules (Oyama *et al.*, 1995). β-Amyloid (1-40) exhibited ionophore-like properties in human erythrocytes and Ca²⁺ channels were formed in synthetic bilayers (Arispe *et al.*, 1995; Engström *et al.*, 1995; Pollard *et al.*, 1995). The increase of intracellular Ca²⁺ after amyloid infusion was found to be slow and required aggregation of amyloid; therefore, it seems unlikely that a direct activation of receptors or channels is involved (Mattson *et al.*, 1993).

The neuroprotective mechanism for sAPP has not been identified in detail. A β-amyloid-sensitive cell surface receptor linked to a GTP cyclase is supposed to exist. Activation of this receptor leads to an increase of cGMP and a reduction of intracellular Ca²⁺. sAPP has neuroprotective and also growth-promoting functions. However, the neuroprotective effect is not due to the growth-promoting part of the molecule, as synthetic molecules show. The Ca²⁺ stabilizing and neuroprotective action of sAPP is mediated by a glycosylated region. A specific high-affinity binding site of sAPP to fibroblasts has been reported. sAPP modulation of Ca²⁺ levels is probably mediated by cGMP since they can be mimicked by cGMP analogues such as nitroprusside (Mattson *et al.*, 1993). It is interesting to note that β-amyloid fragment 1-28 is not toxic and does not aggregate *in vitro* and furthermore does not increase intracellular Ca²⁺ influx (Hu and El-Fakahany, 1993). This indicates that aggregation, intracellular Ca²⁺ influx, and neurotoxicity are directly related.

sAPP can activate K⁺ channels and suppress neuronal activity (Furukawa *et al.*, 1996) and acts in a neuroprotective way by hyperpolarizing neurons (Mattson, 1997). β-Amyloid fragments, however, inhibit K⁺ channels and impair K⁺-dependent Ca²⁺ flux (Mattson, 1994; Good and Murphy, 1996). β-Amyloid fragments also block Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase activity which indirectly impairs ion-exchange pumps that remove excess intracellular Ca²⁺ (Mark *et al.*, 1997). When blocking K⁺ channels in fibroblasts taken from AD patients, the Ca²⁺ response seen in control cells was absent (Mattson, 1994).

The role of the voltage-dependent Ca²⁺ channel (VDCC) in β-amyloid (25–35) neurotoxicity was examined using rat cultured cortical and hippocampal neurons. When L-type VDCCs were blocked by application of nimodipine, β-amyloid (25-35)-induced neurotoxicity was attenuated, whereas application of ω-conotoxin GVIA or ω-agatoxin IVA, the blocker for N- or P/Q-type VDCCs, had no effects. Whole-cell patch-clamp studies indicated that the Ca²⁺ current density of β-amyloid (25-35)-treated neurons is about

twofold higher than that of control neurons. Also, β-amyloid (25-35) increased Ca²⁺ uptake, which was sensitive to nimodipine (Ueda *et al.*, 1997). Interestingly enough, nimodipine improved learning in aged rats and in demented humans (Disterhoft *et al.*, 1994).

Apoptosis is programmed cell death which is dependent on intracellular Ca²⁺ changes. In brains of patients with AD, the apoptosis-inducing proteins p53 (Kitamura *et al.*, 1997) and bar (MacGibbon *et al.*, 1997) were increased. β-Amyloid (25-35) caused apoptosis in a Ca²⁺-dependent way in several *in vitro* studies (Copani *et al.*, 1995; Zhao *et al.*, 1997). β-Amyloid fragment (1-40) also induced apoptosis in a different study of cultured cells. This effect was dependent on the NMDA-glutamate receptor (Le *et al.*, 1995). One could imagine that part of the β-amyloid-induced Ca²⁺-dependent neurotoxicity is due to triggering the apoptosis program in neurons.

### The Free Radical Hypothesis

Free radicals are molecules with unpaired electrons that are highly reactive and can be toxic. Increased calcium influx is known to be cytotoxic, and among other effects Ca²⁺ increases the production of free radicals by activating enzymes that produce free radicals, such as PLA₂ which liberates arachidonic acid, which subsequently becomes metabolized by cyclooxygenases and lipoxygenases, a process that produces free radicals (Farooqui and Horrocks, 1994; Tocco *et al.*, 1997). Therefore, it has been suggested that the production of free radicals is a main factor in the cytotoxic processes that underlie AD. β-Amyloid fragments can induce production of free radicals in cell cultures (Lezoualc'h *et al.*, 1998). In one *in vitro* study, β-amyloid fragment (25-35) induced production of reactive oxygen species that induced neurotoxicity. Vitamin E, a radical scavenger, reduced the level of free radicals, neurotoxicity, and Ca²⁺ uptake in cultured neurons (Ueda *et al.*, 1997). β-Amyloid fragments also have been shown to activate superoxide radical production in endothelial cells (Thomas *et al.*, 1996). Taken together, these results suggest that β-amyloid (25-35) generates free radicals which in turn increase Ca²⁺ influx via Ca²⁺ channels, thereby inducing neurotoxicity (Ueda *et al.*, 1997). However, since scavengers of free radicals do not always rescue neurons, it is to be assumed that other factors play vital roles in the development of neuronal death (Lockhart *et al.*, 1994).

Increased oxidative stress has been measured *in vivo* in transgenic mice that overexpress wild-type APP (Pappolla *et al.*, 1998), and increased levels of free radicals were found in blood samples of patients with AD (Ihara *et al.*, 1997). This suggests that oxidative stress contributes to neurodegeneration in AD.

In Down's syndrome, cyclooxygenases are induced and produce increased free radicals (Oka and Takashima, 1997). The induction of cyclooxygenases in neurons, the production of free radicals, and subsequent neuronal death have been shown *in vivo* after challenge with excitotoxins (Tocco *et al.*, 1997). In rheumatoid arthritis patients that use nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) which also inhibit cyclooxygenases, an inverse relationship was found between use of NSAID and the frequency of AD (Eikelenboom *et al.*, 1994). NSAID appear to slow down AD development (Schnabel, 1993), and recent studies show that the NSAID ibuprofen inhibits the induction of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) (Stratman *et al.*, 1997) which could be the basis for some of the effects of NSAID.

In addition, nitric oxide synthase becomes activated by Ca²⁺ and produces nitric oxide (Schmidt *et al.*, 1992) which is toxic in high concentrations (Maiese *et al.*, 1994). Other free radicals produced by β-amyloid are superoxide species (Klegeris and McGeer, 1997; Suo *et al.*, 1997). In brain tissue taken from patients with Alzheimer's disease, increased levels of iron, aluminum, and mercury were found. These metals can produce free radicals. Also, increased lipid peroxidation and decreased polyunsaturated fatty acids were measured. Increased 4-hydroxynonenal, an aldehyde product of lipid peroxidation, was found in icv fluid. Furthermore, increased protein and DNA oxidation, diminished energy metabolism, and decreased cytochrome c oxidase were measured. Additionally, heme oxygenase-1 and superoxide dismutase-1 were observed in neurofibrillary tangles and in plaques, and increased catalase, glutathione reductase, and peroxidase levels were measured in brain tissue. These enzymes are responsible for reducing levels of free radicals in cells (Gooch and Stennett, 1996; Lyras *et al.*, 1997; Mark *et al.*, 1997; Markesbery, 1997).

A recent study suggests a link between heritable mutations in mitochondrial DNA encoding cytochrome c oxidases I and II and a late onset type of AD. In patients with this type of mutation, increased levels of hydrogen peroxide were measured. Hydrogen peroxide is made mainly by conversion of the superoxide anion O₂⁻, a highly reactive molecule responsible for membrane lipid peroxidation. The exposure to higher levels of free radicals might increase the probability of onset of AD by inducing continuous cellular damage

over time. However, the mutation alone does not appear to induce early onset of AD (Mattson, 1997).

### Nitric Oxide

Among the free radicals linked to cytotoxic events, nitric oxide deserves a special mention. The neuronal messenger nitric oxide is produced in the brain by a specific enzyme, NOS, of which a Ca²⁺-sensitive isoform is expressed in neurons (Snyder and Bredt, 1992; Hölscher, 1997). It is known that overproduction of nitric oxide can be neurotoxic. The neurotoxic effects of NMDA were found to be mediated in part by nitric oxide (Connop et al., 1995). Activating the NMDA receptor opens a Ca²⁺ channel which in turn activates NOS. Furthermore, β-amyloid activated NOS in cell culture studies of human neurotypic SH-SY5Y cells (Li et al., 1996) and induced the expression of NOS in cultured rat astrocytes (Akama et al., 1998). The neurotoxic effects of β-amyloid in cell cultures were found to be dependent on nitric oxide synthase activity as studied *in vitro* (Le et al., 1995) or in biochemical studies of tissue taken from patients with AD (Good et al., 1996). Expression of inducible NOS has been observed in AD (Vodovotz et al., 1996), and NOS-expressing neurons in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex were found to be susceptible to neuronal death in the development of AD (Thorns et al., 1998). Mice which lack neuronal NOS do not show typical neurotoxic degeneration found after ischemia (Huang et al., 1994). Inhibiting NOS with a selective inhibitor (that does not affect blood pressure) is neuroprotective (Schulz et al., 1995). It has been shown that the neurotoxic effects of nitric oxide in ischemia are mediated by Ca²⁺ (Maiese et al., 1994). Ca²⁺ influx caused by β-amyloid or upregulation of the NMDA receptor by β-amyloid could therefore activate NOS in neurons which then contributes to neurotoxic processes.

#### Electrophysiological Studies of the Effect of β-Amyloid on Synaptic Transmission

Even though β-amyloid clearly displays cytotoxic properties and should have profound effects on neuronal activity, very few studies actually investigated the effect of β-amyloid on neuronal transmission. Perfusion of hippocampal slices with β-amyloid modulated NMDA-glutamate receptor activity. After bath application of the (1-40) fragment, the NMDA receptor-dependent response was increased irreversibly. In contrast, α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepionic acid (AMPA) receptor-mediated transmission

was not affected (Wu et al., 1995). An *in vivo* electrophysiological study analyzing hippocampal glutamatergic transmission showed a delayed reduction of baseline synaptic responses after a single icv injection of β-amyloid fragment (1-40). This decay of neuronal transmission was prevented by a NMDA receptor antagonist (Cullen et al., 1996). β-Amyloid fragment (25–35) induced a similar reduction of neuronal transmission which was reversed by inhibitors of neuronal NOS (Hölscher, submitted).

### III. STRATEGIES TO PREVENT NEURODEGENERATION IN AD

Since the exact causes of AD are not known, it is not possible to directly tackle the source of the neurodegenerative biochemical processes. However, as outlined above, a number of factors that are crucial for degenerative development have been identified and a list of possible strategies to interfere with these factors can be drawn up. A number of strategies to prevent or ameliorate neurodegeneration in AD are promising. What follows is a selection of compounds that have been shown to affect neurotoxic processes in previous studies and that might be of interest for therapeutic use (see also Fig. 2).

**Antioxidants.** Recent studies have shown that antioxidant LY231617 protects against ischemia-induced neuronal damage in rat models of global cerebral ischemia (O'Neill et al., 1997). Also, the neurotoxic action of β-amyloid in cell culture was blocked by U-83836E and vitamin E (Zhou et al., 1996). Higher doses of antioxidants might be suitable as a prophylactic measurement with minimal risks of severe side effects that might develop with other drugs when applied over a long time. In risk groups, this treatment could start from childhood onward.

**Neuronal NOS inhibitors.** The moderately selective neuronal NOS inhibitor 3-bromo-7-nitroindazole protected against ischemia-induced neuronal damage (O'Neill et al., 1997). The lipophilic compound 7-nitroindazole might be of advantage since it can be given as a depot injection to ensure drug effects over longer time periods (Hölscher et al., 1996). A more selective neuronal NOS inhibitor [1-(2-trifluoromethylphenyl) imidazole (TRIM) (Handy et al., 1996)] might also be a superior compound to prevent β-amyloid-induced toxicity. Selectivity for neuronal NOS is of importance because inhibition of endothelial NOS results in an increase of blood pressure and can compromise cerebral blood flow (Iadecola, 1997). NOS inhibitors are

FIG. 2. Sketch depicting the postulated cytotoxic chain of events initiated by β-amyloid which ultimately results in production of free radicals and neuronal death. β-Amyloid activates phospholipase C that produces IP₃ that in turn activates intracellular Ca²⁺ stores and can produce ion channels when aggregated. β-Amyloid also affects NMDA receptors, voltage-dependent Ca²⁺ channel receptors, and indirectly K⁺-dependent Ca²⁺ pumps by affecting K⁺ channels and the Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase ion exchanger. Increased intracellular Ca²⁺ in turn activates a number of Ca²⁺-sensitive enzymes that produce free radicals which are toxic at high concentrations. Abbreviations used: COX, cyclooxygenases; IP₃, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; LOX, lipoxygenases; PLA₂, phospholipase A₂; PLC, phospholipase C; NMDA rec., N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor; VDCC, voltage-dependent Ca²⁺ channel.

under investigation for suitability as agents to treat Alzheimer's disease (Molina et al., 1998).

Ca²⁺ channel blockers. The late phase of neuronal death induced by β-amyloid was prevented by Ca²⁺ channel blockers such as Co²⁺, nicardipine, and acid diltiazem (Abe and Kimura, 1996). Nimodipine, an L-type Ca²⁺ channel blocker, improved learning in aged rats and in demented humans (Disterhoff et al., 1994).

NSAID, cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors. NSAID which are also inhibitors of cyclooxygenases have a small effect on improving the symptoms of AD (Schnabel, 1993; Eikelenboom et al., 1994; McGeer and McGeer, 1996). Since cyclooxygenases are induced in neurons and play a role in neurotoxic processes (Hölscher, 1995;

Tocco et al., 1997), an inhibitor for the inducible isoform [(cyclooxygenase-2), SC58125 (1,2-diarylcyclopentene)] promises protective effects.

Metabotropic glutamate receptor antagonists that act long-term without interfering with neuronal transmission in a detrimental way. Additionally, presynaptic agonists such as L-AP4, L-AP3, or 1S,3S-ACPD would be neuroprotective to a certain degree by reducing transmitter release (Hölscher et al., 1996, 1997) and releasing soluble amyloid precursor protein (Lee et al., 1996; Lee and Wurtman, 1997; Ulus and Wurtman, 1997).

Cellular damage can be ameliorated or prevented by growth factors. Several types of growth factors promise positive results for treating AD:

Review on Alzheimer's Disease

- Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) has been shown to protect hippocampal neuronal cultures from degeneration induced by β-amyloid peptide (Ren and Flanders, 1996).
- Insulin-like growth factor I can protect hippocampal neurons against β-amyloid toxicity (Doré et al., 1997).
- A membrane-permeating activator of NFκB transcription factor protects cells against β-amyloid toxicity by reducing cell sensitivity to oxidative stress (Goodman and Mattson, 1996; Lezoualc'h et al., 1998).
- Nerve growth factor (NGF) was shown to protect human cortical neurons against hypoglycemic damage by stabilizing calcium homeostasis (Cheng and Mattson, 1994).
- Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) exhibits trophic activity for neurons in the brain and can protect those neurons against excitotoxic, metabolic, and oxidative insults. bFGF can protect cultured hippocampal neurons against β-amyloid (25–35) toxicity by a mechanism that involves suppression of free radical accumulation and maintenance of Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase activity (Mark et al., 1997).

Multiple preventive strategies could be more effective since it is conceivable that toxic processes that underlie Alzheimer’s disease act at several levels and that monocausal preventive strategies might have limited effects.

## Parallel Treatments—A Promising Approach

It might be a more successful approach to use several types of drugs which act at several levels of symptom development simultaneously, similar to treatment of symptoms of AIDS. Treatment of HIV-1 infections with protein synthesis inhibitors, reverse transcriptase inhibitors, and other drugs did not produce the desired effects when given alone, but given together the effect of each drug was multiplied in a synergistic fashion and helped to reduce symptoms considerably (Perelson et al., 1997). In AD, similar effects are to be expected. For example, the graft of NGF-releasing cells into brains of primates did not rescue neurons from β-amyloid-induced neurotoxicity. Growth factors only extend the survival rate of cells exposed to stressful environments but do not prevent the causes of neurodegeneration such as the accumulation of β-amyloid (Kordower et al., 1997). Giving for example doses of vitamin E over long periods of time together with injections of growth factors and Ca²⁺-stabilizing agents could prove to be more protective than a single target drug treatment strategy. Ultimately, drugs that interfere with APP proteolysis and β-amyloid formation might be the best strategy in preventing the β-amyloid-induced toxic processes, should the theory of β-amyloid-induced neurodegeneration prove to be correct.
