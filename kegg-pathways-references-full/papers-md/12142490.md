■ Abstract Entamoeba histolytica, as its name suggests, is an enteric parasite with a remarkable ability to lyse host tissues. However, the interaction of the parasite with the host is more complex than solely destruction and invasion. It is at the host-parasite interface that cell-signaling events commit the parasite to $(a)$ commensal, noninvasive infection, $(b)$ developmental change from trophozoite to cyst, or $(c)$ invasion and potential death of the human host. The molecule central to these processes is an amebic cell surface protein that recognizes the sugars galactose (Gal) and N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) on the surface of host cells. Engagement of the Gal/GalNAc lectin to the host results in cytoskeletal reorganization in the parasite. The parasite cytoskeleton regulates the extracellular adhesive activity of the lectin and recruits to the host-parasite interface factors required for parasite survival within its host. If the parasite lectin attaches to the host mucin glycoproteins lining the intestine, the result is commensal infection. In contrast, attachment of the lectin to a host cell surface glycoprotein leads to lectin-induced host cell calcium transients, caspase activation, and destruction via apoptosis. Finally, trophozoite quorum sensing via the lectin initiates the developmental pathway resulting in encystment. The structure and function of the lectin that controls these divergent cell biologic processes are the subject of this review.

INTRODUCTION

Amebiasis is caused by *Entamoeba histolytica*, an enteric protozoan parasite exclusively of humans with a remarkable ability to kill cells in a contact-dependent manner. The two major clinical syndromes of amebiasis are amebic colitis and amebic liver abscess. Together they are thought to result in 50 million cases of colitis and liver abscess and 100,000 deaths worldwide each year (47, 81). There is no zoonotic reservoir, and no insect vectors required for transmission. The life cycle is therefore simple, with an infectious cyst and invasive trophozoite. Infection occurs when the cyst is ingested via contaminated water and food. This has been seen most recently in epidemic form with an outbreak in Tbilissi, Republic of Georgia, due to a fecally contaminated municipal water supply (5), but occurs endemically every day among the poor of developing countries (30).

In developing countries, colonization with *E. histolytica* has been observed in 5% or more of poor children. Less than 10% of colonized individuals develop colitis, with the rest clearing the infection within months (24, 30). Patients with amebic colitis typically present with a several-week history of gradual onset of abdominal pain and tenderness, diarrhea, and bloody stools (dysentery). The pathological lesions in the colon include ulceration of the intestinal epithelium and invasion into the lamina propria by trophozoites (52, 80). Inflammation, with infiltrating neutrophils and mononuclear lymphocytes, is pronounced, but inflammatory cells near the amebae appear lysed with pyknotic nuclei. Liver abscess may present acutely with fever, right-upper abdominal tenderness and pain, or subacutely with prominent weight loss and abdominal pain. Most frequently patients with liver abscess will not have concurrent colitis, although a history of dysentery in the preceding year can sometimes be obtained (47).
The mysteries of the disease include:

1. the parasite, host, and environmental factors that determine if an amebic infection will be noninvasive or result in amebic colitis or amebic liver abscess;
2. the mechanism of parasite persistence in the host that leads to the sometime months-long latent period between infection and disease;
3. the adult male predominance of amebic liver abscess in the face of a lack of any sex or age predisposition to colonization and colitis; and
4. the biological fitness for the parasite that is derived from invasion and potential killing of the host by the noninfectious stage of the parasite.

## THE COLONIC ENVIRONMENT AND DETERMINANTS OF INVASION

In the intestine, the ingested cyst excysts into eight trophozoites. It is in the intestine that the determinants of invasive versus commensal infection must come into play (Figure 1). Different strains of the parasite may intrinsically differ in their invasiveness. This is most remarkably the case with “nonpathogenic zymodemes,” which never cause disease and are now genetically reclassified as a separate species *E. dispar* (70, 77). However, most *E. histolytica* (sensu stricto) infections also do

**Figure 1** Environmental factors recognized by the Gal/GalNAc lectin that may signal encystment or invasion. Colonic mucin glycoproteins and/or bacteria may initiate a Gal/GalNAc lectin–induced encystment pathway. During encystment the Gal/GalNAc lectin may also be involved in cyst wall formation. Depletion of mucins allows parasite contact with the epithelial cell surface and ingestion of exudated erythrocytes, initiating an invasion pathway. Upon invasion of the host, lectin-mediated killing of immune effector cells and evasion of complement C5b-9 lysis may allow survival of the parasite.not lead to invasion (30). It is likely that *E. histolytica* strains vary in invasiveness and that host innate and immune responses contribute to whether an infection leads to disease. Subtle interactions between the amebae, the human intestinal mucin glycoproteins, and the resident bacterial flora of the colon are also likely to be important.

One of the factors influencing invasiveness may be the bacterial flora of the intestine. Bacteria appear to be more than just a major food source for the amebae. Amebic trophozoites in the large intestine reside among bacteria in the mucin blanket that coats the intestinal epithelium. Bacteria influence the balance between production of trophozoites and cyst, with only certain mixtures of bacteria capable of supporting encystation in vitro (22). Because of the inability of the cyst to invade, conditions that promote encystment should inhibit invasiveness. Certain strains of bacteria in vitro have also been shown to alter the adherence and cytotoxicity of the trophozoite (7) and to downregulate the levels of the adherence lectin light subunit (see below).

Invasiveness is also controlled by the mucin glycoprotein layer on the intestinal epithelium. The predominant secretory mucin of the intestine is encoded by the gene *MUC2*. The MUC2 protein is extensively modified in the Golgi by the addition of O-linked GalNAc residues (78). The extremely high content of O-linked carbohydrate (80% by mass) of MUC2 makes it a high-affinity ligand for the *E. histolytica* Gal/GalNAc lectin (*K*~D~ = 8.2 × 10^−11^ M) (12, 61). The *MUC2* gene is highly polymorphic, with at least 12 alleles identified in Caucasian populations (78). It is interesting to consider whether polymorphisms in *MUC2* could explain differing sensitivities of individuals to *E. histolytica* infection and disease. As amebae enter the mucin coat, their ability to invade may be prevented by mucins binding to and inhibiting the activity of the lectin and by the physical barrier between parasite and host epithelium, which the mucin coat produces. For example cell lines that produce mucins are more resistant to in vitro killing by *E. histolytica*; this resistance is blocked by O-glycosylation inhibitors, which prevent normal glycosylation of the mucin glycoproteins. The interaction is also modified by the amebae: Amebae degrade mucins at sites of invasion in humans (51, 52), and amebae have a heat-stable mucus secretagogue activity, which results in goblet cell mucus secretion from both glandular and interglandular regions. The nonpathogenic ameba *E. moshkovskii* does not have this secretagogue activity (14). One of the most important roles of mucin glycoproteins may be in the regulation of encystation: In the related parasite *E. invadens* mucins induce trophozoites to transform into cysts (21, 22).

Finally the interaction of ameba with red blood cells likely has a role in invasion. Amebae containing ingested red blood cells are commonly seen in the stool and colonic ulcers of patients with amebic colitis (47). The red cells are endocytosed via the parasite lectin. The noninvasive parasite *E. dispar* is much less likely to ingest red blood cells. It is interesting to speculate that ingestion of erythrocytes induces a virulence program in the amebae leading to colitis or liver abscess, whereas interaction with mucin glycoproteins has the opposite effect by inducing
encystation. Virtually nothing is known about the effects of red cell ingestion on in vitro or in vivo pathogenicity of *E. histolytica*.

# PARASITE AND HOST GENETIC DETERMINANTS OF INVASIVENESS

Little is understood about genetic differences in *E. histolytica* or humans that control the outcome of infection, with two exceptions: (a) Amebic liver abscess is predominantly a disease of adult males, and (b) *E. histolytica* has been reclassified into noninvasive (*E. dispar*) and potentially invasive (*E. histolytica*) species. The varied organ tropisms and clinical presentations of infection by *E. histolytica* sensu stricto have stimulated interest in the role of *E. histolytica* genetic diversity in virulence. Polymorphisms in genes encoding repetitive sequences have allowed typing of *E. histolytica* (18). Using these techniques genetic differences between *E. histolytica* from different parts of the world, and even within a single refugee camp, have been demonstrated. For example, 25 distinct polymorphisms were observed among 42 stool isolates, and an additional 9 distinct patterns among the 12 liver abscess isolates in Dhaka, Bangladesh (4). The great number of different strains typed by DNA polymorphisms has to date, however, prevented correlation of a particular strain with invasiveness. From the standpoint of the host, the understanding of genetic determinants of invasiveness has received a major boost from the study of infection in preschool children in Dhaka. In a prospective study 7% of all new *E. histolytica* infections in the population were attributable to a trait associated with susceptibility to infection (R. Haque & W.A. Petri, unpublished data). Delineation of the human genes influencing susceptibility to amebiasis promises to be generally enlightening for understanding parasite interaction with the innate and acquired immune systems.

# PARASITE LECTIN-MEDIATED ADHERENCE TO THE HOST

Carbohydrate-protein interactions are responsible for the contact-dependent cytotoxicity for which *E. histolytica* was named. A cell surface lectin of *E. histolytica* trophozoites binds to host galactose (Gal) and N-acetyl-D-galactosamine (GalNAc) (48, 60). Trophozoite adherence to human colonic mucin glycoproteins is inhibited by 90% by Gal or GalNAc (14), as is adherence to human neutrophils and erythrocytes (28), certain bacteria (7), as well as a variety of cell culture lines (36, 37). Studies of human neutrophils have confirmed that the parasite Gal/GalNAc lectin (and not fibronectin, vitronectin, CD11/CD18 integrins, complement or mannose-binding protein) is the only defined adhesin participating in the adherence event (10).

Perhaps the most significant observation is that blockade of lectin activity with Gal or GalNAc prevents the contact-dependent cytotoxicity for which the organism

is named (60). Additionally, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell glycosylation-deficient mutants lacking terminal Gal/GalNAc residues on N- and O-linked sugars are nearly totally resistant to amebic adherence and cytolytic activity (36, 37, 64). The first receptor encountered by the lectin may be the human colonic mucin layer of the large intestine (13). Chadee et al. demonstrated that binding of the lectin to colonic mucins is Gal/GalNAc-inhibitable and of high affinity (dissociation constant of $8.2 \times 10^{-11} \mathrm{M}^{-1}$) (14). Interaction of trophozoites with colonic mucins appears to be a dynamic process, with trophozoites both inducing the secretion of and degrading colonic mucins (12). The mucin layer may protect the host from contact-dependent cytotoxicity by the parasite by binding to and neutralizing the lectin while serving as a site of attachment for the parasite to colonize the large bowel.

### Identification of the Gal/GalNAc Lectin

The lectin was originally purified by carbohydrate affinity chromatography and with adherence-inhibitory monoclonal antibodies (mAb) (46, 48), an approach later repeated by Tannich and colleagues (76). The Gal/GalNAc lectin is composed of a 260-kDa heterodimer of disulfide-linked heavy (170 kDa) and light (35/31 kDa) subunits, which is noncovalently associated with an intermediate subunit of 150 kDa (Figure 2). The purified 260-kDa heterodimer retains GalNAc-binding activity to cells (49) and neoglycoproteins (1).

The heavy (170 kDa) subunit gene ($hgl$) sequence contains an amino-terminal 15-amino acid hydrophobic signal sequence, an extracellular cysteine-rich domain

![Diagram](attachment:diagram.png)

**Figure 2** Gal/GalNAc adherence lectin of *Entamoeba histolytica*. The Gal/GalNAc lectin mediates parasite adherence to, and killing of, host cells. It is present on the plasma membrane of the ameba and is composed of three subunits. The integral membrane heavy subunit (Hgl) has a short cytoplasmic tail implicated in intracellular signaling. The carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) is located within hgl. Hgl is disulfide bonded to a lipid-anchored light subunit (Lgl). Finally, the lipid-anchored intermediate subunit (Igl) is noncovalently associated with the hgl-lgl heterodimer. The functions of Lgl and Igl in adherence and killing are unknown.
of 1209 amino acids containing sites for N-linked glycosylation, and transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of 26 and 41 amino acids, respectively (39, 76). Disulfide bonds apparently fold the lectin into a protease-resistant structure, as the lectin is only sensitive to proteolytic attack upon reduction and alkylation of cysteine residues (39). Approximately 6% of the mass of the heavy subunit is carbohydrate; tunicamycin treatment of amebae prevents N-linked glycosylation of the lectin and results in amebae with dramatically reduced ability to adhere. The heavy subunit gene family consists of five unlinked genes in *E. histolytica* (57). The *hgl* gene products are 89%–95% identical at the amino acid level, with the most variable region being the cysteine-free domain comprising amino acids 188 to 378. The *hglI* gene product has been sequenced from four different *E. histolytica* isolates and was shown to be remarkably conserved (M. Tanyuksel & W.A. Petri, unpublished data).

The light subunit is encoded by multiple genes encoding isoforms with different posttranslational modifications. The major 35- and 31-kDa isoforms have nearly identical amino acid compositions and CNBr-fragmented peptide patterns (41, 42). The 35-kDa isoform is more highly glycosylated and lacks the acyl-glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor present on the 31-kDa isoform. The light subunit gene family has 6–7 members; the light subunit genes that have been sequenced encode proteins with an amino-terminal signal sequence of 13 amino acids and an unusually short 7-amino acid carboxy-terminal GPI-anchor addition motif. There are greater sequence differences between *lgI* genes than between *hgl* genes, with the *lgI* genes sequenced only sharing 79%–85% identity. Four light subunit-specific mAb have been produced, which recognize distinct epitopes on five different light subunit isoforms. Immunoblots with these mAb demonstrate co-migration of light and heavy subunits when nonreduced trophozoite proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, indicating that the subunits do not exist free of the heterodimer in significant quantities. Whereas anti-heavy subunits inhibit adherence, light subunit-specific antibodies do not, consistent with the heavy subunit containing the carbohydrate recognition domain (43).

There is some indirect evidence for a role of Lgl in virulence despite the fact that it apparently does not directly mediate adherence. Co-cultivation of *E. histolytica* with *Escherichia coli* serotype 055 has long been known to lead to a reduction in cytolytic activity of the amebae. Recently it has been recognized that this is associated with a reduction in expression of the lower-molecular-weight isoforms of Lgl (45). Similarly, expression of Lgl mRNA and the Lgl lower-molecular-weight isoforms are decreased in the Rahman strain of *E. histolytica*, which is defective in cytolysis and is avirulent in animal models. Overexpression of Lgl in Rhaman, however, did not restore cytolysis, indicating that the cytolysis defect is not solely due to decreased Lgl expression (45). In strain HM1:IMSS, antisense RNA was used to decrease Lgl protein expression. This had no effect on Hgl protein but surprisingly resulted in a substantial decrease in the native lectin heterodimer (2). It is unclear from this work where the Hgl protein uncomplexed with the heterodimeric lectin is located in the cell. However, the decrease in lectinheterodimer was associated with a 50% decrease in monolayer destruction and cell killing and with an inability to form liver abscess in hamsters. There was no difference in adherence or in erythrocyte endocytosis, both processes mediated by the lectin. This suggests that the levels of lectin on the cell surface of the antisense-expressing cells were high enough to mediate some, but not all, functions of the lectin. Together these experiments are consistent with a role for Lgl in lectin-mediated cytolytic and virulence.

The Hgl-Lgl heterodimer has a unique mechanism of membrane association: Hgl is transmembrane but Lgl is GPI-anchored. The role of the GPI modification in membrane anchoring, assembly, and function of the lectin heterodimer has been tested. Epitope-tagged Lgl with or without the GPI-anchor addition signal was expressed in *E. histolytica* trophozoites. Full-length FLAG-tagged Lgl protein, detected with FLAG-specific mAb, was precipitated in association with Hgl. In contrast the FLAG-tagged Lgl protein lacking the GPI-anchor addition signal did not assemble with Hgl into a lectin heterodimer (56).

The lack of heterodimerization of the GPI-deficient Lgl construct with Hgl enabled determination of the ability of Lgl to bind carbohydrate in the absence of Hgl. The only identified CRD on the lectin is in Hgl. Previously it had not been possible to test the light subunit independently for Gal/GalNAc-binding activity because reduction of the disulfide bonds needed to separate it from Hgl-destroyed lectin carbohydrate-binding activity. Lysates of cells expressing mutant Lgl were incubated with Gal-agarose beads or with control beads [GalNAc-agarose conjugated via the 3-OH position to destroy recognition by the amebic lectin (82)]. The full-length Lgl protein was detected in the eluate from the Gal beads by virtue of its association with Hgl. However, the GPI-deficient Lgl protein, which was not heterodimerized with Hgl, was not bound to the Gal beads. It was concluded that Lgl protein, when not part of the heterodimeric lectin, lacks detectable carbohydrate-binding activity.

Interference with the overall production of Lgl via antisense production results in a reduction in heterodimeric lectin and a decrease in cytotoxicity (2). Inducible or constitutive expression of the Lgl construct lacking the GPI signal sequence had no detectable effect on adherence or cytotoxicity (data not shown) likely because the mutant Lgl could not heterodimerize with Hgl. Additionally, expression of the GPI-Lgl protein did not interfere with assembly of the native endogenous Lgl into functional lectin. A picture is beginning to emerge on the roles of Hgl and Lgl in the amebic lectin: Carbohydrate-binding and cell-signaling activities appear to be limited to Hgl, whereas the GPI-anchor addition sequence of Lgl enables heterodimer formation and may endow the lectin with yet-to-be discovered biologic properties.

The intermediate subunit (Igl), also known as the “150-kDa lectin” originally described by Tachibana and colleagues, is noncovalently associated with the 260-kDa lectin heterodimer (16). Initially identified as a target of mAbs that block trophozoite adherence, this lectin has been shown to be intimately associated with the Gal/GalNAc lectin in several different ways. Igl is present in small amounts in
preparations of the Gal/GalNAc lectin that have been purified by either Gal-
affinity chromatography or anti-Hgl mAb-affinity chromatography. Similarly, Hgl
is present in small quantities in the Igl purified with mAb directed against Igl.
In native gel electrophoresis, Igl and the Hgl-Lgl heterodimer co-migrate at an
estimated molecular mass of 380 kDa.

Two different gene copies of Igl have been cloned from *E. histolytica* (15).
They encode proteins with 84% amino acid identity. The *igl* genes encode novel
proteins of 1101 amino acids with hydrophobic amino- and carboxy-terminal signal
sequences consistent with a GPI-anchored plasma membrane protein. Igl1 and
Igl2 have calculated molecular masses of 119,987 and 119,513 and predicted
isoelectric points (pI) of 5.03 and 5.61, respectively. In contrast, the estimated
molecular mass and pI of the native Igl is 150 kDa and 6.9, respectively, which
suggests the existence of posttranslational modifications in the native protein.
The most abundant amino acid residues are cysteines (12.3%), lysines (9.5%),
and threonines and serines (both 8.9%). The amino acid sequences predict 12
potential N-glycosylation sites and 3 O-glycosylation sites. The Igl proteins lack a
carbohydrate-recognition motif but have limited sequence identity with the variant
surface glycoproteins (VSPs) of *Giardia lamblia* (for example, BLAST e value
of \(2e^{-42}\); 22% identity of amino acids 32-1036 with amino acids 51-1126 of pir
T42017). The sequence identity includes some of the “CXXC” motifs of the VSPs
implicated in protein-protein interactions.

# Carbohydrate Recognition by the Gal/GalNAc Lectin

The interaction of the lectin with host glycoconjugates is multivalent and of high
specificity. This was demonstrated experimentally by the 100,000-fold-greater
affinity of Gal/GalNAc-containing polyvalent neoglycoproteins than the monosac-
charides Gal or GalNAc. The stereospecificity of the multivalent binding of Gal/
GalNAc by amebic and hepatic (also known as the asialoglycoprotein recep-
tor) Gal/GalNAc lectins differs. Small synthetic oligosaccharides (such as NAc-
YD(G-GalNAcAH)2), which bind with high affinity to the hepatic Gal/GalNAc
lectin, do not bind with high affinity to the *E. histolytica* lectin. The optimal spacing
of polyvalent GalNAc residues has not been defined, but work with neoglycoprotins
differing in the concentration of GalNAc has indicated that wider GalNAc spacing
is tolerated for the parasite lectin than for the hepatic lectin. The amebic lectin
may recognize maxiclusters, which are multivalent structures spaced at relatively
greater distances on a polypeptide backbone, more than the “miniclusters” formed
by branching tri- or tetraantennary termini of N-linked glycoproteins recognized
by the hepatic lectin (1). This may reflect the amebic lectin’s engagement of mucin
glycoproteins, which have terminal Gal/GalNAc O-linked oligosaccharides widely
spaced on elongated mucinpolypeptide backbones.

GalNAc is the preferred carbohydrate determinant over Gal, with approximately
sevenfold-higher affinity for the monosaccharide and 1000-fold-higher affinity for
GalNAc- than Gal-containing oligosaccharides. Lactose (Gal β1-4 glucose) and

N-acetyl-lactosamine (GalNAc β1-4 glucose) are not of higher affinity than GalNAc, indicating that the lectin binds a single saccharide residue. In low-ionic-strength buffers, lectin binding to GalNAc requires calcium, and the presence of a hydrophobic aglycon on p-nitrophenyl β-N-acetylgalactosaminide increased affinity eightfold, which suggests that the carbohydrate-binding domain has a high-affinity site for calcium ions and an aromatic side chain. The substructural specificity of monosaccharide recognition is also different for the parasite lectins than for the hepatic lectins. Both hepatic and amebic lectins require 3-OH and 4-OH groups of GalNAc, whereas only the amebic lectin requires the 6-OH group (82). In contrast, the amebic lectin had greater tolerance for changes at the N-acyl position. For example, replacement of the N-acetyl group with the bulkier N-benzoyl group increased amebic lectin affinity twofold and decreased hepatic lectin affinity eightfold. This suggests that the N-acyl-binding area of the amebic lectin is more spacious than that of the hepatic lectin. Consistent with this, the free amino sugar galactosamine was only eightfold less potent for the amebic lectin but 1000-fold less potent for the hepatic lectin. Overall a picture emerges of a unique multivalent lectin-glycoconjugate interaction that should be amenable to specific (and potentially therapeutic) inhibition with GalNAc-containing oligosaccharides (1).

## The Carbohydrate Recognition Domain

The carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) of the lectin is a potential target for colonization-blocking vaccines or drugs. Adherence-inhibitory mAb epitopes are contained within the extracellular cysteine-rich domain of the heavy subunit, making this a likely location for the CRD (38). Direct assignment of carbohydrate-binding activity to either the 170-kDa or 35-kDa subunits of the native lectin was not possible, as the reduction in disulfide bonds required to separate the subunits resulted in loss of carbohydrate-binding activity (W.A. Petri, unpublished results). Both lectin subunits lack sequence identity to well-characterized lectin carbohydrate-binding domains [including the mammalian C type lectins (mannose-binding protein and E-selectin), mammalian galectins, the legume lectins, wheat germ agglutinin, ricin, *E. coli* heat-labile enterotoxin, cholera toxin, or the influenza virus hemagglutinin] (68). Other investigators have remarked on an area of the heavy subunit with limited sequence identity to wheat germ agglutinin (76); however, none of the wheat germ agglutinin active-site residues and few of the critical cysteines required for intrasubunit disulfide bond formation are present in the corresponding lectin sequence.

It is not surprising that sequence analysis has failed to identify the carbohydrate-binding domain, as even carbohydrate-binding domains that interact with the same monosaccharide can have diverse structures. For example, only the plane formed by the C3-C6 carbons of the Gal residues and the aromatic side chain (tryptophan, tyrosine, or phenylalanine) in the binding site is well conserved for several Gal-binding lectins, while the rest of the binding site residues differ (68). A second difficulty with interpretation of linear sequence data is that the

carbohydrate-binding domains are formed not by linear stretches of amino acids but by amino acid residues that are scattered over the primary sequence of one or more subunits and brought together by the tertiary folding of the lectins. Nonetheless, sequence analysis has not aided the identification of the carbohydrate-binding domain.

The first hint that the heavy subunit contained the CRD was the observation that mAb directed against it affected Gal/GalNAc-binding activity. In contrast, mAb and polyclonal antibodies directed against the light subunit isoforms have no significant effect on adherence or cytotoxicity (40). Neutralizing mAb epitopes on the Hgl protein all mapped to the cysteine-rich domain (amino acids 482-1138). Antibodies that blocked or augmented Gal/GalNAc-binding activity were mapped between lectin residues 482-818, suggesting that the carbohydrate-binding domain is located in this part of the cysteine-rich domain (38).

A likely site for the CRD was amino acids 895-998 of the cysteine-rich region where the adherence-inhibitory mAb 8C12 mapped. The sequence of the 104-amino acid fragment is completely conserved among other members of the *E. histolytica* lectin gene family and 89% conserved in the homologous protein expressed by the closely related noninvasive parasite *E. dispar*. The CRD and the unrelated amino-terminal cystein (C) and tryptophan (W)-rich domain of the lectin were expressed in *E. coli* as recombinant polyhistidine fusion proteins. As expected, mAb 8C12 recognized the purified CRD fusion protein. Two adherence-enhancing mAbs (3F4 and 8A3) that mapped to the CRD by deletion analysis did not recognize the polyhistidine CRD fusion protein on a Western blot. This suggests that these mAbs recognized conformational epitopes or epitopes located elsewhere on the protein, which depended on the presence of the CRD for their structures. Two other adherence-inhibitory mAbs recognized epitopes on either side of the 104-amino acid fragment, each about 100 amino acids away. Therefore epitope mapping pointed to, but did not unambiguously identify, the region from amino acids 895-998 as the CRD of the *E. histolytica* lectin. A GalNAc-containing neoglycoprotein (a synthetic glycoprotein) was used to test the hypothesis that the 104-amino acid CRD fragment contained a carbohydrate recognition domain. *E. histolytica* membranes bind to the polyvalent neoglycoprotein, GalNAc₂₀BSA, with 500,000-fold-higher affinity than to GalNAc monosaccharide. The purified CRD polyhistidine fusion protein bound ¹²⁵I-labeled GalNAc₂₀BSA, whereas the CW protein did not. Binding of GalNAc₂₀BSA by the CRD fusion protein was calcium-dependent and specifically inhibited by the Gal/GalNAc-terminal glycoprotein asialofetuin. Immunization with CRD resulted in an antisera that completely blocked adherence and passively transferred partial immunity to challenge with *E. histolytica* in the liver of gerbils (20).

Kain and colleagues in vitro transcribed and translated intact and fragmented Hgl2 protein to map regions with carbohydrate-binding activity. The full-length and cysteine-rich fragment (amino acids 356-1143) of Hgl, but not the amino-terminal fragment (amino acids 1-480), exhibited binding to CHO cells that were 60% inhibited with Gal. The fragment from amino acids 480-900 bound to

GalNAc-BSA-coated microtiter wells but not to BSA-coated wells, consistent with this region containing a Gal-binding domain. Kain and colleagues concluded that the CRD is located within the cysteine-rich region, with residues 356-480 and/or 900-1143 required for high-affinity binding (50). One conclusion from the studies of these two groups is that carbohydrate-binding activity is contained within the cysteine-rich domain of Hgl. Somewhat unresolved is whether there is more than one CRD in this domain, as the two groups demonstrated carbohydrate recognition activity in fragments with only minimal overlap [amino acids 895-998 by (20) and amino acids 480-900 by (50)].

# Conformational Control of Carbohydrate Binding

A surprise from mAb mapping of the lectin heavy subunit was the discovery that mAb against epitopes 1 and 2, but not epitopes 3–6, dramatically enhanced trophozoite adherence to CHO cells and human colonic mucins (49). Antibody-mediated enhancement of adherence occurred at 4°C and was Gal/GalNAc-specific. Antibody-mediated clustering of the lectin was not the explanation for increased binding, as Fab fragments of epitope 1 mAb also increased binding. Increased Gal/GalNAc-binding activity of the lectin induced by epitope 1 mAb was directly demonstrated by showing enhanced binding of purified lectin to CHO cells. Together the data were consistent with mAb binding inducing a change to a more active conformation of the Gal/GalNAc lectin. The significance of this observation is that the lectin's carbohydrate-binding activity appears to be conformationally controlled, similar to other eukaryotic adhesins including CR3 of human neutrophils and LFA-1 of T lymphocytes. The ability to control lectin activity may provide trophozoites with a mechanism to detach from mucins and epithelial cells as they invade the host.

We hypothesized that this regulation could occur via inside-out signaling mediated by the lectin cytoplasmic domain. This is a particularly attractive hypothesis partly because the lectin cytoplasmic tail contains regions of identity with the cytoplasmic tail of β2 integrin-like domains. These domains are important in integrin inside-out signaling. Inducible expression of a fusion protein containing the lectin transmembrane and cytoplasmic tail (using the tetO-inducible expression system), but not a fusion protein containing the transmembrane but not the cytoplasmic tail, resulted in a 50% decrease in adherence. The induced fusion protein containing the cytoplasmic tail was intracellular, did not covalently associate with the light subunit to form heterodimers, and did not affect the level of cell surface wild-type lectin. We therefore concluded that the decreased adherence was a dominant-negative effect of the fusion protein on regulation of lectin activity. Mutation (to alanines) of the T<sub>1253</sub>I<sub>1254</sub>T<sub>1255</sub>…Y<sub>1261</sub> β-integrin motif in the lectin cytoplasmic tail motif resulted in an abrogation of the dominant-negative phenotype. These observations raise the possibility of similar mechanisms of inside-out signaling in integrins and lectin (79).

Interference with inside-out signaling caused an 84% decrease in the size of amebic liver abscesses in an animal model, supporting the importance of the lectin.
and of adhesive regulation, in virulence. Erythrophagocytosis, serum resistance, and cytolysis of adherent amebae were not affected by the dominant-negative effect on inside-out signaling, indicating that the mechanism by which the lectin mediates these phenotypes is not dependent on inside-out signaling.

# Sequence Similarity of CRD to Hepatocyte Growth Factor

Sequence analysis of the CRD revealed that it had limited sequence identity to the receptor-binding domain of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). Specifically, the region from amino acids 913-939 of CRD had 52% sequence identity with amino acids 59-85 of HGF, which forms part of the receptor-binding domain sufficient for high-affinity HGF binding. HGF is produced by mesenchymal cells and acts as a growth stimulator of epithelial cells. It also stimulates the motility and invasiveness of epithelial and endothelial cells and is also known as a “scatter factor” for that property. It paradoxically has cytotoxic and growth inhibitory properties in some situations. Its high-affinity receptor is the c-met proto-oncogene product. HGF binding to c-met results in autophosphorylation of c-met intracellular tyrosine kinase domain (Y1235), which is associated with activation of its catalytic activity. The increased cell motility and decreased cell-cell adhesions induced by HGF may be mediated in part by tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin and focal adhesion kinase, and activation of the small GTP-binding protein rho. It also stimulates the activation or induction of proteases that degrade the extracellular matrix. Therefore, a potential interaction of the lectin (via its CRD domain) with the c-met receptor was interesting for the potential promotion of amebic invasiveness via disruption of epithelial barriers and/or dissolution of the extracellular matrix. We tested the ability of the CRD to compete with HGF for binding to its receptor c-met using a microtiter plate assay. HGF binding to c-met was competed with excess CRD or native lectin but not with the unrelated CW fusion protein. The competition of HGF binding to c-Met was not due to the carbohydrate-binding activity of CRD: Inhibition of HGF binding to c-met by 2 μM his-CRD was 54 ± 5.1% with, and 56 ± 2.6% without, 50 mM GalNAc (20). The ability of the lectin to compete with HGF for binding to c-met is consistent with recognition of c-met by the amebae. The contribution of such an interaction to the liver tropism of *E. histolytica* remains to be delineated.

# Gal/GalNAc Lectin-Associated Proteins

Evidence is accumulating of proteins that are noncovalently associated with the lectin, either with its extracellular, membrane, or cytoplasmic domains. Hughes and Mann (unpublished data) have used the yeast two-hybrid genetic screen to identify proteins interacting with the cytoplasmic tail of the lectin. The 29-kDa alkylhy-droperoxide reductase (peroxidase) was identified with the yeast two-hybrid using the cytoplasmic tail as bait. Interaction with the amebic cytoplasmic tail was confirmed in vivo by confocal microscopy and immunoprecipitation. The peroxidase activity of the protein is potentially important in the detoxification of reactive
oxygen and sulfur species that the amebae are exposed to during interaction with the host polymorphonuclear lymphocytes. The biologic importance of the membrane localization of the peroxidase achieved via interaction with the lectin cytoplasmic tail is yet to be determined. Analysis of two-dimensional gels of affinity-purified Gal/GalNAc lectin show a complex pattern of proteins, which suggests that the lectin serves as a nucleation site for a number of different proteins potentially involved and required for interaction with the host.

# KILLING OF HOST CELLS

*Entamoeba histolytica* was named by Schaudinn in 1903 for its ability to lyse tissues. Destruction of host cells is contact-dependent (via the Gal/GalNAc lectin) and extracellular. *E. histolytica* trophozoites in vitro kill a wide variety of tissue culture cell lines as well as human neutrophils, T lymphocytes, and macrophages. Contact-dependent killing of CHO cells and other target cells is nearly completely inhibited by Gal and GalNAc, and CHO cell glycosylation-deficient mutants lacking terminal Gal residues on N- and O-linked sugars are nearly totally resistant to amebic adherence and cytolytic activity (Figure 3).

The mechanism of contact-dependent killing by *E. histolytica* has been the subject of intensive investigation. Killing requires an intact parasite: Amebic filtrates or sonicates are not cytotoxic. The important role of the parasite cytoskeleton in killing has been demonstrated by C3 intoxication of amebic Rho (27), by cytochalasin disruption of the cytoskeleton (60), and by expression of dominant-negative myosin II (3). Intracellular calcium in target cells rises approximately 20-fold within seconds of direct contact by an amebic trophozoite and is associated with membrane blebbing (62). Cell death occurs 5–15 min after the lethal hit is delivered. Extracellular EDTA and treatment of the target cells with the slow sodium-calcium channel blockers verapamil and bepridil (63) significantly reduce amebic killing of target cells in suspension.

Isolation of amebic pore-forming proteins similar in function to pore-forming proteins of the immune system has been reported by a number of investigators. A purified 5-kDa amebapore and a synthetic peptide based on the sequence of its third amphipathic α-helix has cytolytic activity for nucleated cells at high concentrations (10–100 μM) (33, 34). Amebapore has a pH optimum of 5.3 and is inactive at pH 7, which may be of some significance in light of the inhibition of cytotoxicity with weak base treatment of amebae. Interestingly, no DNA degradation was observed in cells lysed in vitro by the purified amebapore, suggesting a different mechanism of cell killing by the purified amebapore than by the intact parasite (6). Constitutive expression of antisense RNA against the amebapore caused an approximately 50% drop in its expression, yet almost completely blocked cytolysis as assessed by trypan blue release (8), and dramatically decreased liver abscess formation. The potential problem with these experiments is that the high levels of drug selection required to achieve partial antisense inactivation of the amebapore mRNA may have artifactually inhibited amebic cytotoxicity. This could be

Figure 3 Contact-dependent killing of host cells by *Entamoeba histolytica* trophozoites. Amebae adhere to the target cell via a parasite lectin specific for Gal and GalNAc residues on the host cell. Only after adherence via the lectin does contact-dependent killing of the host occur [reprinted with permission from (40)].

resolved if the experiments were repeated using inducible expression of antisense RNA. This is possible with inducible promoter systems developed for *E. histolytica* based on the tetracycline operator-repressor system (29, 58, 79).

Cells killed by the parasite undergo nuclear chromatin condensation, membrane blebbing, and internucleosomal DNA fragmentation (31, 55). Nuclei of hepatocytes in a mouse model of amebic liver abscess were labeled by terminal deoxynucleotidyl-transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL), consistent with an apoptotic death. Several lines of evidence infer a nonclassical mechanism of apoptotic killing by *E. histolytica*. Overexpression of the Bcl-2 protein that inhibits apoptosis due to a variety of cellular stresses (e.g., serum starvation and UV radiation) did not prevent murine cell DNA fragmentation following exposure to *E. histolytica* (55). Furthermore, *E. histolytica* caused hepatocyte apoptosis in mice deficient in the Fas/Fas ligand and TNF-RI signaling pathways (73). Taken together, these data suggest that *E. histolytica*

initiates host cell apoptosis by directly activating the host cell’s distal apoptotic machinery.

Huston et al. have demonstrated that killing of the Jurkat human T lymphocyte cell line occurred via apoptosis, as judged by DNA fragmentation and caspase 3 activation. This killing was inhibited by Gal. Classical upstream caspases seemed not to be involved, as caspase 8–deficient cells, resistant to killing by fasL, were readily killed by Eh. Caspase 8–deficient cells treated with a caspase 9 inhibitor (Ac-LEHD-fmk) (at a level sufficient to inhibit apoptosis via etoposide) were readily killed as well. In contrast, the caspase 3 inhibitor Ac-DEVD-CHO at 100 μM (sufficient to block killing via actinomycin D) blocked *E. histolytica* killing, as measured both by DNA fragmentation and C<sup>51</sup> release, indicating that it was necessary for both apoptotic death phenotype and necrosis to occur (31). Blockade of caspases blocks amebic liver abscess formation in mice (32). The upstream trigger that activates caspase 3 remains unknown (31).

The importance of apoptosis in disease was indicated by the extensive apoptotic death of host cells at the site of invasion of amebic trophozoites during intestinal infection, the most prevalent form of amebiasis. The parasite’s ability to form liver abscesses is impaired in amebae rendered defective in cytotoxicity either by inducible expression of a dominant-negative mutant of the Gal/GalNAc lectin or by expression of antisense amebapore RNA (2, 79). *E. histolytica* cytotoxicity therefore appears crucial to the ability of the parasite to cause disease.

# The Role of Lectin in Cytotoxicity

Apposition of amebic and target cell plasma membranes, as can be achieved by centrifugation of target cells and amebae into a pellet, will not lead to cytolysis if the amebic lectin is inhibited with Gal/GalNAc (59) or if the target cell lacks Gal and GalNAc on its surface (37, 64). This is consistent with the lectin mediating not only adherence but also participating in the cytolytic event. The identification of anti-lectin mAb directed against epitope 1 of the heavy subunit, which blocked cytotoxicity but not adherence, directly implicated the lectin in the cytotoxic event (69). The same anti-lectin mAb that blocked cytotoxicity also caused a conformational change in the lectin that increased carbohydrate-binding capacity. One could speculate that the mAb blocks cytotoxicity by preventing a second conformational change in the lectin required for cell killing.

Killing occurs after the lectin engages GalNAc on O-linked target cell surface oligosaccharides: The Lec1 CHO mutant, which lacks lactosamine-containing N-linked carbohydrates but contains normal O-linked carbohydrates, was killed nearly as efficiently as wild-type cells. In contrast, the ldlD/Lec1 CHO cell mutant that lacks both N- and O-linked structures was almost completely resistant to amebic cytotoxicity (36, 37, 64). Lectin-mediated capping of the O-linked structures in Lec1 [which are unaltered compared to wild-type CHO cells and should be Sialic acid-Gal-(Sialic acid)GalNAc] could be deduced to mediate killing.

# Transfer of the Lectin to Host Cells

Interaction of the ameba with the host cell results in transfer of the lectin to the host; this is an active process that requires an intact viable parasite (35). Localization of the lectin to the lateral surface of epithelial cells is seen within five minutes of interaction with *E. histolytica* trophozoites, before any destruction of the cells. Transfer of the lectin to epithelial cells is not observed when amebic sonicates or filtrates are applied to the monolayers. Transfer of the lectin is decreased by 86% upon addition of Gal, GalNAc, or lactose, which indicates a requirement for parasite adherence to epithelium for transfer to occur. Transfer of 29-kDa and 96-kDa surface antigens is not observed, indicating some specificity to the transfer event. Transfer of the lectin precedes death of the host cells, raising the question if the transfer is involved in the process of cell death. Transfer is specific to epithelial-derived cell lines and is not seen in fibroblast lines. Because amebae kill both epithelial and fibroblast cell lines, if the lectin transfer event is involved in epithelial cell death, then a different mechanism of killing must be involved in fibroblast death. The significance and mechanism of transfer of the lectin therefore remains intriguing and mysterious.

# LECTIN-MEDIATED RESISTANCE TO COMPLEMENT LYSIS

The complement system is one of the first barriers to infection in nonimmune individuals; circumvention of this defense is central to the pathogenesis of amebiasis. Invasion of the colon and hematogenous spread to the liver result in the continuous exposure of the extracellular trophozoite to the human complement system. Trophozoites activate the classical and alternative complement pathways in the absence of anti-amebic antibodies. Incubation of trophozoites in normal human sera results in depletion of human complement as measured by CH50 and C5b-9 hemolytic assays and C3 and C4 depletion (65). The amebic 56-kDa cysteine protease cleaves C3 at a site one amino acid distal to that of the human C3 convertase and may be the route by which complement is activated (67). Depletion of complement in hamsters by cobra venom factor treatment increases both the frequency and severity of amebic liver abscess, providing evidence of the protective role of the complement system in amebiasis (11).

*E. histolytica* freshly isolated from patients with invasive amebiasis, and laboratory strains passed through animals, activates the alternative complement pathway but is resistant to C5b-9 complexes deposited on the membrane surface (65–67). On the other hand, amebae cultured from the stool of asymptomatically infected individuals or virulent amebae attenuated by axenic (in the absence of associated bacteria) culture activate the alternative complement pathway and are killed by C5b-9 (65, 66).

Killing of amebae is mediated by the terminal complement components, and the direct lysis of sensitive but not resistant *E. histolytica* has been demonstrated with

purified complement components C5b-9 (66). Resistance to terminal complement attack in *E. histolytica* could be due to an amebic cell surface protein with C5b-9-inhibitory activity or by endocytosis or shedding of the C5b-9 complex. Rapid membrane repair via shedding or endocytosis of the membrane-inserted C5b-9 complex has been postulated to confer C5b-9 resistance to several different cells, including nucleated mammalian cells and the metacyclic (infective promastigote) stage of *Leishmania major*. However, shedding or release of C9 from the membrane is not the explanation for C5b-9 resistance in *E. histolytica*, as C9 binding is higher in resistant than in sensitive amebae.

Braga et al. produced mAb against serum-resistant amebae and identified an antibody that increased *E. histolytica* lysis by human sera and by purified human complement components C5b-9. It was a surprise that the antigen recognized by the antibody was the 170-kDa lectin subunit (9). Inhibition of complement resistance by anti-170-kDa mAb was shown to be specific to mAb-recognizing epitopes 6 and 7. Examination of the sequence of the 170-kDa subunit showed limited identity with CD59, a human inhibitor of C5b-9 assembly, and the purified lectin was recognized by anti-CD59 antibodies. The lectin bound to purified human C8 and C9 and blocked assembly in the amebic membrane of the complement membrane attack complex at the steps of C8 and C9 insertion.

The lectin gene family therefore appears to participate not only in adherence and host cell killing but also in evasion of the complement system of defense via a remarkable mimicry of human CD59. Gal/GalNAc inhibition of lectin activity had only a minor effect on C5b-9 resistance of trophozoites, which suggests that the lectin and complement regulatory domains of the lectin are distinct.

## REGULATION OF LECTIN GENE EXPRESSION

The control of transcription of the *hgl5* lectin heavy-subunit gene is beginning to be understood now that gene transfection is possible in *E. histolytica* (44, 53). Primer extension and nuclear run-on analyses are consistent with monocistronic transcription of the gene with a lack of 5′ processing of *hgl5* mRNA (75). Several unique features are present in the core promoters of protein-encoding genes including *hgl5* in *E. histolytica* (54, 75) (Figure 4). An initiator element (Inr) [AAAAATTC] surrounds the site of transcription initiation and is conserved in 37 *E. histolytica* protein-encoding genes. The sequence is divergent from that of other eukaryotic initiators. Inr controls the site of transcription initiation in *hgl5* if both GAAC and TATA elements are mutated (75). The GAAC element [GAAC] is present between TATA and Inr in 31/37 promoters examined. Mutation of GAAC decreases the rate of transcription and results in new transcription start sites. Positional analysis demonstrates that GAAC directs a new transcription start site 2–7 base pairs downstream of itself (75). An *E. histolytica* nuclear protein of an estimated 36-kDa mass exhibits sequence-specific binding to GAAC (74). Finally a TATA element [GTATTAAA(G/C)] is present at –30 bases upstream of transcriptional start site.

URE1 URE2 URE3 URE4 URE5

TATA GAAC INR

Figure 4 Cartoon depiction of the promoter for the *hgl5* virulence gene of *E. histolytica*. Transcription factors bound to upstream regulatory elements (URE) interact with general transcription factors bound to the core promoter elements (TATA, GAAC, and INR) to promote or inhibit transcription by RNA polymerase II.

Positional analysis demonstrates that TATA directs a new transcription site 30–31 base pairs downstream of itself (75).

The requirement for three core promoter elements is fascinating: Why would transcription of protein-encoding genes in *E. histolytica* be dependent on a third core regulatory region? Perhaps the *E. histolytica* TFIID complex has multiple DNA-binding regions composed of TBP-, GBP-, and Inr-binding proteins. A variety of preassembled TFIID complexes could exist, containing some or all of the core promoter-binding proteins. These different TFIID complexes could differentially regulate a variety of core promoters containing all three or only one or two of these regulatory regions. A second model is based on the fact that TBP in vitro binds to multiple AT-rich sequences. The specificity of TBP binding to the TATA region is conferred in large part by its proximity to other regulatory regions. In an AT-rich organism such as *E. histolytica* a mechanism may have developed in which a factor such as GBP localizes TBP to the promoter. Thus a model can be hypothesized in which transcription in *E. histolytica hgl5* genes may be dependent on protein-protein interactions where GBP functions to tether or localize TBP/TFIID to the core promoter.

The upstream elements of the promoter for *hgl5* were mapped by deletions and scanning mutagenesis to the 272 bases upstream of the start of transcription (54). Five UREs were identified by mutational analysis. The two elements having the most pronounced effect on gene expression have been further studied. URE3 (TATTCTATT at –80 base pairs) differs from the other UREs in that it is a negative regulatory element in *hgl5*. The URE3 sequence is also present in the 5′ upstream regions of at least seven other *E. histolytica* genes (25, 26). URE3 is a positive regulatory element in the ferredoxin (*fdx*) gene. Its activity is induced in stationary phase growth (74). Yeast one-hybrid traps were used to identify an amebic protein (URE3-BP) with sequence-specific binding to URE3. Analysis of the protein sequence did not reveal a canonical DNA-binding motif but

did demonstrate two calcium-binding EF hand motifs. The recombinant URE3-BP demonstrated calcium-dependent and sequence-specific recognition of the URE3 double-stranded DNA sequence. With only one other calcium-regulated transcription factor identified in a eukaryote, it will be of wide interest to determine the role of calcium signaling in control of amebic virulence gene expression.

Mutation of URE4 (a direct 9–base pair repeat of the sequence AAAAATGAA at –170 base pairs) results in the greatest drop in reporter gene expression controlled by the *hgl5* promoter (54, 72). The URE4 sequence is also present in the *hgl3* 5′ flanking region. Promoter activity controlled by the URE4 element is induced upon serum starvation of trophozoite cultures (74). DNA sequence-specific affinity chromatography identified two URE4 enhancer-binding proteins, EhEBP1 and 2 (71). Recombinant EhEBP1 and 2 bound double-stranded DNA containing the URE4 sequence in a sequence-specific manner, and overexpression of EhEBP1 in trophozoites led to a sevenfold drop in reporter gene activity controlled by URE4, confirming its ability to bind to the URE4 motif in vivo. Interestingly both EhEBP1 and 2 contained the RNA-binding motif RRM (71). Two previously described DNA-binding proteins that contain RRM motifs share with EhEBP1 and 2 recognition of AT-rich DNA sequences. In the context of the AT-rich *E. histolytica* genome, it will be important to determine if transcription factors containing RRM motifs are a common feature.

With the *E. histolytica* genome project nearing completion, and DNA microarrays for gene expression analysis coming online, an exciting and rapidly moving period of discovery of gene expression profiles is in store. The detailed analysis of the *hgl5* promoter should provide a framework for future understanding of virulence gene regulation.

## ROLE OF THE LECTIN IN ENCYSTATION

The transformation of trophozoite to cyst in the large intestine completes the life cycle of *E. histolytica*. Without formation of the cyst, the parasite would be unable to infect another individual. The pioneering work of Eichinger and colleagues has shed the first light on the biological mechanisms of encystation (17, 19, 21, 22). Using the reptilian parasite *E. invadens*, which encysts readily in vitro, as a model system, sequential steps in the process have been delineated. Following initiation of encystation by nutrient deprivation and hypo-osmotic stress, individual trophozoites aggregate into large multicellular groups. The aggregation stage is catalyzed by the presence of precise amounts of polyvalent Gal-terminated molecules (serum or mucin glycoproteins or *Crithidia fasciculata*). Encystment medium lacking serum glycoproteins is less efficient at induction of encystation (from 90% in the presence of glycoproteins to 25% encystment in their absence).

Mucin may be one physiologic ligand that induces the aggregation stage of encystment as the mucin blanket is where the amebic trophozoites reside in the large intestine. Mucin has a narrow range of in vitro activity to induce aggregation and subsequent encystment, suggesting that the control over cyst production by
the parasite is equally precise. The importance of terminal Gal residues on the mucins was demonstrated by increased potency of the mucins when treated with neuraminidase, and abrogation of activity if the mucins were first treated with $\beta$-galactosidase. The lectin may also have a role in cyst wall formation at a later step of the process. A chitin-binding lectin potentially involved in cell wall synthesis may be anchored to the surface of encysting trophozoites by the Gal lectin (23).

The addition of free monomeric Gal blocks the encystment process at the step of aggregation and blocks encystment-specific transcripts (“gene 122,” chitinase, and ubiquitin) (19). An attractive hypothesis from this work is that engagement of Gal-rich mucin glycoproteins by the amebic lectin stimulates trophozoite aggregation and/or cell-to-cell signaling to initiate the process of encystation.

## ACQUIRED IMMUNE RESPONSE TO THE LECTIN IN CHILDREN

The importance of the Gal/GalNAc lectin for parasite adherence, invasion, and encystation suggested that an immune response against it could mediate protection from amebiasis. Haque and colleagues (30) investigated this issue in an observational study of *E. histolytica* infection in children in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Specifically they asked whether protection from intestinal infection correlated with mucosal or systemic antibody responses to the *E. histolytica* Gal/GalNAc adherence lectin. The presence of stool anti-lectin IgA was associated with the absence of *E. histolytica* colonization: 0% (0/64) of IgA (+) and 13.4% (33/246) of IgA (−) children were infected as determined by antigen detection (*p* = 0.001). This finding was followed up with a one-year prospective study of 289 children ages 2–5 in Dhaka. During the 12 months, 39% (105/269) of the children had at least one new *E. histolytica* infection. Children with stool IgA lectin–specific antibodies at the beginning of the study had 64% fewer new *E. histolytica* infections by 5 months [3/42 IgA (+) versus 47/227 IgA (−); *p* = 0.03]. The conclusion from these studies was that a mucosal IgA anti-lectin antibody response is associated with immune protection against *E. histolytica* colonization. Recent studies demonstrating that immunization with the lectin provides protection from amebic colitis in a mouse model (E. Houp & W.A. Petri, unpublished data) lends credence to the conclusion that the human immune response against the lectin leads to acquired immunity.

## SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

It is at the plasma membrane of the parasite that interactions with the host and environment lead to crucial decisions to invade or to encyst. It is increasingly clear from the past two decades of research that a single molecule, the Gal/GalNAc lectin, has the decisive role in these processes. Interaction of the lectin with precise quantities of mucin glycoproteins leads to formation of the cyst, whereas adherence of the trophozoite to the intestinal epithelium via the lectin leads to contact-dependent
cytolysis and death of the host. Our knowledge of the contribution of the lectin to host invasion and to formation of the infectious cyst is not an end but a beginning. What lies ahead is to understand how the cellular processes initiated by the lectin result in infection and disease. The challenge is to comprehend the complex single cell and multicellular behavior of a parasite that remains one of mankind’s scourges.
