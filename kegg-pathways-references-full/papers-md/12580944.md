### Summary

Macrophages (MØ) are used as the intracellular niche by several bacterial and protozoan microorganisms. Such microbial pathogens adopt diverse strategies to avoid MØ microbicidal effects. Recent insights into the *Toxoplasma gondii*-MØ interaction reveal novel ways that intracellular parasites subvert MØ function. In contrast to some microbial pathogens, *Toxoplasma* infection is not silent but induces rapid activation of transcription factors such as STAT-1 and NFκB. However, the parasite blocks nuclear translocation of both factors, and MØ cannot produce IL-12 or TNF-α when subsequently triggered with lipopolysaccharide. The nuclear import blockade is lifted 24 h after infection, but cells remain actively suppressed in TNF-α production. Nevertheless, IL-12 synthesis is initiated at this later time point. *Toxoplasma gondii*-induced production of this cytokine occurs through both MyD88- and CCR5-dependent pathways. The balance of cytokine subversion and stimulation during infection probably results from the parasite’s need to simultaneously avoid immune elimination and trigger immunity to prevent host death.

### Macrophage function during microbial infection

Macrophages (MØ) are evolutionarily ancient cells that play a key role in defence against infection. As a component of the innate immune system, these cells are poised to respond to microbial antigens and possibly host ‘danger’ signals that alert presence of infection (Matzinger,

the requisite three signals necessary to drive Th1-type  
acquired immunity (Kalinski *et al.*, 1999). Thus, whereas  
dendritic cells are currently more commonly ascribed the  
role of immune-initiator, MØ may also be important in  
triggering the Th1 response that is crucial to control microbial  
infection.

Despite the fact that MØ are potent effectors of innate  
immunity, the cells serve as hosts for several protozoan  
pathogens. Such microorganisms have adopted diverse  
strategies for intracellular survival. Some create or retreat  
into safe intracellular compartments. This is the case for  
*T. gondii*, which, after host cell penetration, inhibits acidification  
of the parasitophorous vacuole (Joiner *et al.*,  
1990; Mordue *et al.*, 1999). *Leishmania* spp. block fusion  
between parasitophorous vacuoles and lysosomes, and  
also inhibit phagolysosomal proteases (Desjardins and  
Descoteaux, 1997; Bogdan and Rollinghoff, 1998). *Trypanosoma cruzi* escapes into the cytoplasm after being  
internalized by a process of induced phagocytosis  
(Burleigh and Andrews, 1995). Parasites inside MØ may  
avoid induction of proinflammatory mediators by stimulating  
production of counter-regulatory cytokines such as IL-  
10 and TGF-β, as has been reported for *T. gondii*, *T. cruzi*,  
and *Leishmania* spp. (Bogdan and Rollinghoff, 1999). There are several examples of protozoan interference with  
antigen presentation and T-cell stimulation in infected MØ.  
This is achieved through several mechanisms, including  
reduced expression of major histocompatibility and co-  
stimulatory molecules, as well as inhibition of antigen  
loading onto class II molecules (Kaye, 1995; Bogdan and  
Rollinghoff, 1998; McMahon-Pratt *et al.*, 1998). Finally, the  
protozoans *Leishmania major* and, more recently, *T. gondii* can also actively suppress proinflammatory cytokines  
by disabling intracellular signalling pathways required for  
their synthesis (Carrera *et al.*, 1996; Butcher *et al.*, 2001). How such intracellular pathogens survive and replicate  
within MØ, and how they subvert the antimicrobial action  
of these cells, are rapidly expanding areas of ongoing  
investigation.

### Immune response to *T. gondii* – a primer

Toxoplasmosis, initiated by oral ingestion of the parasite,  
is divided into acute and chronic stages. During acute  
infection, the rapidly replicating tachyzoite form of the  
parasite becomes widely disseminated throughout host  
tissues. This is followed by the chronic stage, in which  
tachyzoites differentiate into bradyzoites, forming long-  
lived cysts in tissues of the central nervous system and  
skeletal muscle. *Toxoplasma* is a prototypic Th1-inducing  
microbial pathogen (Denkers and Gazzinelli, 1998; Yap  
and Sher, 1999a). Infection with *T. gondii* induces high  
levels of proinflammatory cytokines, which are typically  
associated with MØ function. Such cytokines are required  

for protection against the parasite. For example, gene-  
targeted mice that are unable to produce IFN-γ, IL-12,  
TNF-α, or iNOS cannot survive infection (Scharaton-  
Kersten *et al.*, 1996; 1997). Lack of IFN-γ or IL-12 results  
in uncontrolled tachyzoite proliferation and mortality during  
acute infection (0–14 days post inoculation). For the  
case of TNF-α or iNOS deficiency, death occurs later as  
a result of toxoplasmic encephalitis. Both CD4⁺ and CD8⁺  
T lymphocytes, through IFN-γ production, are necessary  
to survive long-term infection (Gazzinelli *et al.*, 1993;  
Hunter and Remington, 1994). Nevertheless, T-cell-deficient hosts survive early stages of toxoplasmosis. This is  
because innate IFN-γ sources – namely, natural killer cells  
– are available to provide a degree of protective immunity.  
IFN-γ is required to survive infection, but less clear is  
how the cytokine exerts its protective function. Although  
nitric oxide is a potent effector molecule against *in vitro*  
tachyzoite growth, the resistance of iNOS knockout mice  
to acute infection clearly implicates other IFN-γ-dependent  
effector mechanisms (Scharaton-Kersten *et al.*, 1997). Both haematopoietic and non-haematopoietic cells  
respond to IFN-γ and mediate protection against *T. gondii*  
(Yap and Sher, 1999b). The recent identification of a family  
of IFN-γ-inducible, GTP-binding molecules involved in  
resistance to *T. gondii* provides the first example of molecules downstream of IFN-γ that are required for survival  
of acute infection (Taylor *et al.*, 2000; Collazo *et al.*, 2001).  
Whereas these proteins localize to the endoplasmic reticulum, their anti-*Toxoplasma* function is obscure.

In certain situations, proinflammatory cytokines mediate host pathology (Gazzinelli *et al.*, 1996; Liesenfeld *et al.*, 1999). Genetically engineered mice defective in IL-  
10 expression succumb during acute *T. gondii* infection,  
not from uncontrolled parasite replication, but as a consequence of immunopathology mediated by overproduction  
of proinflammatory cytokines (Gazzinelli *et al.*, 1996;  
Neyer *et al.*, 1997). Oral infection of certain inbred mice,  
typified by the C57BL/6 strain, leads to lethal necrosis in  
the gut caused by IFN-γ, TNF-α, and nitric oxide (Liesenfeld *et al.*, 1996; 1999; Suzuki *et al.*, 2000). This  
response may involve synergistic interactions between  
lamina propria CD4⁺ T lymphocytes and intestinal epithelial cells (Mennechet *et al.*, 2002). The same mediators  
that are essential to control an otherwise lethal *Toxoplasma* infection are themselves deadly when overproduced. Clearly, a stable host–parasite interaction requires tightly regulated production of proinflammatory cytokines. Both host and parasite engage in this process.

### Subversion of proinflammatory signalling by *T. gondii*

When MØ are infected with *T. gondii*, the cells fail to  
produce TNF-α, and IL-12 production occurs only after a  
delay of approximately 24 h (Butcher *et al.*, 2001; Butcher

© 2003 Blackwell Publishing Ltd, *Cellular Microbiology*, **5**, 75–83
and Denkers 2002). In so far as infected cells are unable to respond to LPS and other stimuli during this time period, it is evident that lack of cytokine production results from an active blockade enforced by the parasite. MØ primed with IFN-γ are also unable to respond to LPS when infected with *Toxoplasma*. Inhibition only occurs in actively infected cells, because MØ internalizing inactive tachyzoites by receptor-mediated phagocytosis maintain LPS responsiveness (Butcher and Denkers 2002).

Importantly, the block in cytokine production is apparent only in infected cells – there is no bystander effect on surrounding non-infected MØ. This argues against parasite-induced release of anti-inflammatory mediators as the basis for the inhibition in proinflammatory cytokine production (Butcher et al., 2001). Instead, the observations suggest that *Toxoplasma*-induced inhibition is an event involving interference within the infected cell of intracellular cascades leading to proinflammatory cytokine production.

### Inhibition of NFκB cascade

Central to control of macrophage genes encoding proinflammatory mediators such as IL-12(p40) and TNF-α is the transcription factor, nuclear factor (NF)κB. This transcription factor, originally identified as a molecule that binds to an enhancer element of the Ig κ light chain gene in B lymphocytes (Sen and Baltimore, 1986), is widely expressed by cells of the immune system. NFκB (also termed Rel) proteins are composed of a family of related molecules named NFκB1 (p105/p50), NFκB2 (p100/p52), RelA (p65), RelB, and c-Rel (Karin and Ben-Neriah, 2000; Caamano and Hunter, 2002). NFκB molecules form homo- and heterodimers, but only p65 and c-Rel contain transcriptional activation domains. In contrast, some NFκB homodimers, in particular p50, mediate transcriptional repression. Homodimers of p50 are thought to contribute to the phenomenon of endotoxin tolerance (Ziegler-Heitbrock et al., 1997; Bohuslav et al., 1998).

NFκB is constitutively expressed in the cytoplasm of macrophages in association with the inhibitory IκB molecule, the latter of which masks a nuclear translocation sequence (NLS). IκB refers to a family of molecules which are structurally related to the carboxy-terminal regions of NFκB molecules p100 and p105. The best understood IκB member is IκBα. Phosphorylation of IκBα at Ser 32 and 36 serves as a signal for polyubiquitination by a multiprotein complex designated E3-SCF<sup>β-TrCP</sup> (Maniatis, 1999; Spencer et al., 1999; Winston et al., 1999). This enables rapid degradation of IκBα by the 26S proteasome, revealing an NFκB NLS. The p65:p50 heterodimer subsequently translocates to the nucleus where it binds to κB sites in several target promoters and activates gene transcription (Roff et al., 1996).

Many different stimuli lead to IκBα phosphorylation in macrophages, including bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), TNF-α, IL-1 and double-stranded RNA. The Toll-like receptors (TLR) are a large family of evolutionarily conserved receptors through which occurs recognition of many microbial antigens (Janeway and Medzhitov 2002). MyD88 is an adapter molecule that transduces such proinflammatory signals from surface to interior of the cell leading to NFκB activation (Bowie et al., 2000). All NFκB activation pathways most likely converge at the enzyme complex which phosphorylates IκBα, namely IκB kinase (IKK) (Karin and Ben-Neriah, 2000). The IKK is composed of IKKα, IKKβ, and IKKγ subunits. The α and β subunit possess catalytic activity and the γ subunit is believed to play a regulatory role. Activation of IKK can be accomplished by multiple means, such as phosphorylation by MAPK/ERK kinase kinase (MEKK)-1, a kinase of the JNK/SAPK mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family (Lee et al., 1997), and also by the activity of other signaling mediators such as NFκB-inducing kinase (NIK) and MEKK3 (Blank et al., 1996; Lee et al., 1997; Malanin et al., 1997).

Several viral and bacterial pathogens target discrete points in the NFκB pathway for inactivation (Fig. 1; Tato and Hunter, 2002). For example, A52R is a vaccinia virus homologue of MyD88 that acts as a dominant-negative form of this protein. The YopJ protein of *Yersinia pseudotuberculosis* inhibits activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinases and IKK that are required for IκBα phosphorylation (Orth et al., 1999). *Yersinia enterocolitica* YopP inhibits the function of IKKβ, a catalytically active subunit of the IKK complex (Ruckdeschel et al., 2001.). The AvrA molecule, which belongs to the same protein family as YopJ and is expressed by most *Salmonella*, prevents NFκB activation downstream of YopJ by interfering with polyubiquitination of phosphorylated IκBα (Collier-Hyams et al., 2002). Measles virus prevents phosphorylation of IκBα through as yet unknown mechanisms (Dhib-Jalbut et al., 1999). Finally, African swine fever virus encodes a protein containing ankyrin repeats similar to cellular IκB. This viral IκB homologue binds to NFκB thereby preventing its translocation following host cell IκB degradation (Revilla et al., 1998). *Toxoplasma* infection of MØ also results in a block in NFκB (p65) nuclear translocation when cells are subsequently stimulated with LPS (Butcher et al., 2001; Shapira et al., 2002). Nevertheless, infection results in rapid IκB phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and degradation. This clearly implicates interference with a step downstream in the sequence of events leading to NFκB nuclear localization.

IκBα resynthesis occurs in *T. gondii*-infected cells, despite lack of NFκB translocation (Butcher et al., 2001). This is paradoxical, because the IκB gene promoter is under strict control of NFκB – activation of the IκB gene

translocation occurs in cell populations present in the peritoneal cavity (Shapira *et al.*, 2002). The latter observation is consistent with the non-permanent effect of parasite blocking of NFκB translocation, although in this case the infection status and type of cells undergoing p50 : p65 nuclear localization remains to be determined.

Intriguingly similar data on the ability of Toxoplasma to block transcription factor nuclear import in MØ have been published by others. The parasite is known to downregulate IFN-γ-driven MHC class II expression in MØ resulting in reduced antigen presentation to T lymphocytes (Luder *et al.*, 1998). In a striking parallel to the NFκB data, IFN-γ-triggered signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)-1 phosphorylation occurs in infected cells, but the activated transcription factor fails to translocate into the nucleus as would normally occur (Luder *et al.*, 2001). The finding that both NFκB and STAT-1 remain cytoplasmic despite their activation makes it tempting to hypothesize a common mechanism used by the parasite to prevent nuclear localization of these proinflammatory transcription factors.

### Nuclear import pathway

Several stages of nuclear import have been identified (reviewed in Gorlich and Mattaj, 1996 and Nakielny and Dreyfuss, 1999). Molecules with an accessible NLS are bound by cytoplasmic importin-α protein. The latter associates as a heterodimer with the importin-β molecule. Phosphorylation of p65 by cAMP-independent protein kinase A may facilitate interaction with importin-α/importin-β heterodimers, as occurs for the closely related proteins Dorsal and c-Rel (Mosialos *et al.*, 1991; Briggs *et al.*, 1998). The importin-β molecule (a nuclear import receptor) docks the NLS-containing protein at the nucleopor complex, which is composed of several discrete proteins (Gorlich *et al.*, 1995). Translocation is an energy-dependent process driven by the small GTPase, Ran (Melchior *et al.*, 1993). Inside the nucleus, the import substrate dissociates from importin-α and importin-β, and the importins are recycled to the cytoplasm.

Because RelA and STAT-1 remain localized in the cytoplasm of Toxoplasma-infected cells, it is possible that one of the steps involved in nuclear import is blocked (Fig. 2A). The other hypothesis, that nuclear export of NFκB is accelerated in infected host cells, is possible but less likely. This is because NFκB relies on newly synthesized IκB for export out of the nucleus. The latter inhibitory molecule, which expresses a nuclear export sequence, binds to nuclear NFκB and mediates translocation to the cytoplasm. Although we find induction of IκB during infection (Butcher *et al.*, 2001), this does not occur until approximately 60 min following invasion. On the other hand, IκB degradation and accompanying failure of NFκB

Fig. 2. Subversion of proinflammatory signalling cascades by *T. gondii*. Under normal circumstances, LPS triggers NFκB activation in a MyD88-dependent pathway leading to induction of TNF-α and IL-12. Production of the latter cytokine depends upon c-Rel activity.

A. Early after MØ infection (approximately 2 h), the parasite disables NFκB and STAT-1 (not shown) nuclear translocation, resulting in a block in production of both TNF-α and IL-12 when infected cells are stimulated with LPS.

B. Later during infection (approximately 24 h), LPS triggered NFκB nuclear translocation is no longer blocked by *Toxoplasma*, resulting in c-Rel-dependent IL-12 production. Nevertheless, the parasite continues to interfere with TNF-α synthesis.

to accumulate in the nucleus normally occurs within 20 min of infection (Butcher et al., 2001). Although there is no precedent for protozoan interference with the nuclear import pathway, some viruses display this capacity. For example, poliovirus prevents docking of nuclear import receptor-cargo complexes at the cytoplasmic face of the nuclear pore complex (NPC), and also induces proteolysis of components of the NPC (Gustin and Sarnow, 2001).

How might *T. gondii* block translocation? There are many possibilities but one recent suggestion is that heat shock proteins (HSP) are involved, either derived from the parasite itself (Dobbin et al., 2002), or perhaps as a host response to intracellular infection. Heat shock has been known for some time to prevent inflammatory cytokine responses in MØ and other cell types by preventing NFκB activation (Snyder et al., 1992; Feinstein et al., 1996; 1997; Vayssier et al., 1998). Two mechanisms have been implicated in this effect. HSP, in particular HSP70, may interact with IκB preventing its phosphorylation and dissociation from NFκB (Wong et al., 1997a,b; Stanley et al., 2000). For *Toxoplasma*, this appears unlikely to account for lack of translocation, because the parasite itself stimulates IκB phosphorylation and subsequent degradation (Butcher et al., 2001).

A second possibility is that HSP70 may impede NFκB nuclear translocation by competing for access to nucleopor complexes (Feinstein et al., 1997; Dobbin et al., 2002). HSP70 possesses an NLS and is known to display nuclear translocation (Welch and Feramisco, 1984; Dang and Lee, 1989). Thus, the mass balance between HSP70

and NFκB would determine the extent to which the latter could gain nuclear access (Feinstein et al., 1997). A prediction of this model is that the nuclear import blockade would be non-specific, precisely as suggested by the concordance of the STAT-1 and NFκB data. In addition, HSP-mediated inhibition of NFκB activation does not persist beyond 4 h after heat shock (Feinstein et al., 1996). The *Toxoplasma*-induced NFκB blockade is also non-permanent, because LPS stimulation of MØ 24 h after infection elicits strong translocation of this transcription factor (Butcher and Denkers, 2002).

Long-term TNF-α suppression

Consistent with the lifting of the blockade in NFκB nuclear import, MØ begin to release IL-12 approximately 24 h after *Toxoplasma* infection. Nevertheless, TNF-α is not produced, and the cells remain actively suppressed in their ability to produce this cytokine (Butcher and Denkers, 2002). From this observation, it can be inferred that *T. gondii* interferes with at least one other molecular event required for TNF-α production, in addition to early effects on NFκB and STAT-1 nuclear import. The target of the second block could be a signalling intermediate as suggested in Fig. 2B, or more distal effects could be involved, such as decreases in mRNA stability. Little is currently known regarding the long-term TNF-α suppression, other than that the effect disappears when intracellular tachyzoites are destroyed by antiparasite drug treatment (Butcher and Denkers, 2002).

# Production of IL-12

The other aspect to the MØ–tachyzoite interaction requiring consideration is the signalling circuits triggered by the parasite that lead to IL-12 production. Details of the pathways are beginning to emerge. The TLR are candidate molecules in *T. gondii* recognition. LPS triggers MØ through TLR4 and MyD88 (Fig. 2), and TLR2 is involved in cytokine responses to *Trypanosoma cruzi* glycosylphosphatidylinositol (Campos et al., 2001). Neither TLR2 nor TLR4 alone are essential for resistance to *T. gondii* (Scanga et al., 2002). Nevertheless, MyD88 knockout mice are susceptible to *T. gondii* and display defects in parasite-induced IL-12 production by MØ, dendritic cells and neutrophils (Scanga et al., 2002). It is likely that a yet-to-be identified TLR, or combination of TLR, mediate responses to *Toxoplasma* (Fig. 3A)

The NFκB family member c-Rel is required for LPS-induced IL-12, but not TNF-α, production (Sanjabi et al., 2000). Therefore, it is particularly interesting that *Toxoplasma*-induced macrophage, dendritic cell and neutrophil IL-12 responses are non-defective in c-Rel null mice (Mason et al., 2002). This may implicate an NFκB-independent pathway of IL-12 production that is triggered by the parasite. IL-12 production without NFκB activation during *Toxoplasma* infection is further supported by studies in gene knockout mice. Thus, in addition to c-Rel, NFκB1, NFκB2, and RelB negative mice can produce IL-12 during *T. gondii* infection (Caamano et al., 1999; 2000). Lack of NFκB p65 translocation in infected MØ despite IL-12 production would tend to support the hypothesis that

production of this cytokine may occur independently of NFκB translocation, although a role for RelA cannot presently be excluded (Butcher et al., 2001; Butcher and Denkers, 2002; Shapira et al., 2002).

A role for IL-12 production independent of NFκB activated through Toll receptor-MyD88 pathways has also been suggested in studies of mice deficient for the chemokine receptor CCR5, a seven-transmembrane receptor that transmits signals through pertusssis toxin-sensitive Gi-like proteins (Aliberti et al., 2000). *Toxoplasma gondii* infection of CCR5 null mice results in decreased IL-12 production and increased susceptibility. Dendritic cells from wild-type animals can be directly triggered to produce IL-12 by CCR5 ligands (MIP-1α, MIP-1β, RANTES). The *in vitro* CCR5⁻/⁻ DC IL-12 response to *Toxoplasma* soluble lysate is reduced but not absent. This is consistent with CCR5-independent, MyD88-dependent signalling, in addition to a CCR5-dependent cascade leading to IL-12 production (Fig. 3B) (Aliberti et al., 2000; Scanga et al., 2002). Consistent with a model in which *T. gondii* may exploit CCR5 to initiate signalling cascades leading to IL-12 synthesis, pertussis toxin inhibits DC IL-12 release (Aliberti et al., 2000). The concept that the parasite may trigger G protein-coupled signalling leading to IL-12 production is interesting, because these molecules are also implicated in downregulating IL-12 responses (Braun and Kelsall, 2001).

## Conclusions

### Immunity and the host–parasite relationship

The emerging realization that *Toxoplasma* infection blocks MØ inflammatory cytokine production raises the question of why this might be important in the host–parasite interaction. The parasite is well-known as a strong activator of both innate and acquired immunity. Infection is associated with high levels of IL-12, TNF- α and IFN-γ, all of which are important in protective immunity to the parasite (Scharton-Kersten et al., 1996; Yap et al., 1998). Indeed, infection induces strong protective immunity to reinfection, and cyst formation itself can be regarded as a parasite strategy to avoid effectors of the immune system. Viewed from this perspective, it may benefit the parasite to temporarily delay or dampen the proinflammatory cytokine response, allowing initial rounds of tachyzoite division to amplify cell numbers. Early expansion of the tachyzoite population may ensure that enough parasites survive attack by the immune system so that cyst formation and parasite persistence occurs within the host.

An alternative possibility is that *Toxoplasma*-induced, non-responsiveness represents a mechanism to avoid immunopathology during infection. It is well established that the parasite can induce overproduction of proinflam-

matory cytokines in certain situations. The importance of IL-10 in avoiding this response is illustrated by the example of IL-10 knockout mice that develop a lethal proinflammatory cytokine shock response during infection with Toxoplasma and other microbial pathogens (Gazzinelli et al., 1996; Neyer et al., 1997). Similarly, *T. gondii* may trigger lethal intestinal pathology that has as its basis inflammatory cytokine overproduction (Liesenfeld et al., 1999). Actively inhibiting induction of proinflammatory mediators in infected macrophages may represent one way of avoiding such pathology during infection.

Stability of the host–parasite relationship during *Toxoplasma* infection demands that the parasite avoids elimination by effectors of host immunity. It also demands that *T. gondii* triggers the immune system to the extent that host death from uncontrolled parasite replication is prevented. The fact that one-third or more of the human population worldwide is asymptomatically infected with *Toxoplasma* is a dramatic indication of how well the parasite and its host have co-adapted to achieve a stable balance. Determining the events enabling stability at the molecular interface of host and parasite promises to reveal fascinating insight into the biology of *Toxoplasma* and other microbial pathogens.
