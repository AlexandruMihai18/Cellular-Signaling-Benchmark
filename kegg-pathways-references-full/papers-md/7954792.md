## Summary

When yeast cells reach a critical size, they initiate bud formation, spindle pole body duplication, and DNA replication almost simultaneously. All three events depend on activation of Cdc28 protein kinase by the G1 cyclins Cln1, -2, and -3. We show that DNA replication also requires activation of Cdc28 by B-type (Clb) cyclins. A sextuple *clb1-6* mutant arrests as multibudded G1 cells that resemble cells lacking the Cdc34 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme. *cdc34* mutants cannot enter S phase because they fail to destroy p40<sup>SIC1</sup>, which is a potent inhibitor of Clb but not Cln forms of the Cdc28 kinase. In wild-type cells, p40<sup>SIC1</sup> protein appears at the end of mitosis and disappears shortly before S phase. Proteolysis of a cyclin-specific inhibitor of Cdc28 is therefore an essential aspect of the G1 to S phase transition.

## Introduction

Sustained cell proliferation requires duplication of all cell constituents, followed by their segregation to daughter cells. Most constituents are synthesized continuously throughout the interdivision period, but chromosomes are duplicated during a discrete interval known as S phase. Cells ensure that chromosomes are duplicated with the same frequency as cells double their mass by controls that prevent S phase entry until cells have grown to a critical size (Killander and Zetterberg, 1965). Experiments involving the fusion of cells at different stages of the cell cycle suggested that S phase is triggered by an inducer that is produced in late G1 as cells reach the critical size and declines later in G2 (Rao and Johnson, 1970).

Candidates for such an inducer were first identified by genetic studies (Hartwell, 1974). DNA replication in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae depends on activation of the Cdc28 protein kinase through its association with G1-specific cyclins called Cln1, -2, and -3 (Richardson et al., 1989). Cdc28 kinase activity associated with Cln1 or Cln2 rises in late G1 owing to the transcriptional activation of the *CLN1* and -2 genes (Koch and Nasmyth, 1994). This process depends on Cln3 (L. Dirick, personal communication).

Clb5-Cdc28 Kinase Activity Peaks around S Phase

To investigate whether Clb5 binds to a protein kinase in vivo, we replaced the endogenous CLB5 gene with an epitope-tagged version (HACLB5), the product of which can be detected on Western blots or immunoprecipitated using the 12CA5 monoclonal antibody (MAb). Clb5-associated histone H1 kinase activity is detected in immunoprecipitates of wild-type cells but is absent in the cdc28-4 mutant (Figure 1A). However, very little HAClb5 protein accumulates in this mutant, presumably because CLB5 transcription depends on CDC28. Cells expressing HAClb5 from the ADH promoter accumulate much higher levels of Clb5 protein in wild-type and mutant cells. This generates more histone H1 kinase activity in wild-type cells but still none in cdc28-4 mutants, suggesting that this activity is due to Cdc28.

The levels of HAClb5 protein and its associated kinase activity were measured during the synchronous outgrowth of a culture of G1 daughter cells isolated by centrifugal elutriation (Figure 1B). Clb5 appeared as cells began to bud at 90 min, preceding the appearance of the G2-specific Clb2 cyclin. Clb5-associated kinase activity appeared as cells entered S phase. The absence of Clb5 in the starting population of G1 cells suggests that most if not all Clb5 protein made during late G1 and S phases is destroyed by the end of cell division. It is less clear from these data exactly when Clb5 protein is degraded. It seems to linger during G2, suggesting that it may be degraded at the end of the cell cycle. The distribution of Clb5–Cdc28 kinase activity during the cell cycle is consistent with this kinase having a role in the initiation of S phase.

B-Type Cyclins Are Required for DNA Replication

Any hypothesis assuming a role for Clb5 and -6 in the initiation of S phase must explain why S phase is merely delayed in clb5 clb6 double mutants. To test whether DNA replication in the absence of Clb5 and -6 is dependent on Clb1-4, we constructed a strain in which CLB1, -3, -4, and -6 are deleted and which carries a temperature-sensitive allele of CLB2 (Amon et al., 1993) and a version of CLB5 that is under control of the GAL1 promoter. This strain can only grow in medium containing galactose at 25°C. Unbudded G1 cells were isolated by centrifugal elutriation and were incubated at 37°C in medium lacking galactose. Few if any cells underwent DNA replication, even after 330 min (Figure 2A). At 150 min, when 35% of the cells had formed buds, an aliquot of the culture was incubated with galactose for 15 min and was then returned to medium lacking galactose. This short burst of CLB5 expression caused all cells to replicate but did not allow them to undergo nuclear division or cytokinesis (Figure 2A). We conclude that DNA replication is totally dependent on CLB gene activity. Cln cyclins are therefore insufficient. Clb5 and Clb6 are most likely to perform this S phase-promoting function (owing to their early expression), but in their absence, one or more of the mitotic Clbs can substitute. Inactivation of Clb1-4 does not affect progression through

at the equivalent stage of the cell cycle in cdc34 mutants, and this is responsible for their failure to enter S phase. Premature expression of CLB5 advances the initiation of S in mutants that lack p40. Thus, activation of Clb–Cdc28 kinases through proteolysis of p40<sup>SIC</sup> could be a crucial step in the initiation of DNA replication in yeast.

S phase, suggesting that these mitotic cyclins are not normally needed for DNA replication (Amon et al., 1993). Finally, Clb5 alone can trigger what seems to be a complete S phase in the absence of Clb1, -2, -3, -4, and -6. It has been suggested that in some strains, Clb1-4 are needed to complete S phase (Richardson et al., 1992).

Despite being unable to replicate DNA, the sextuple clb mutant cells formed buds with normal kinetics (Figure 2A). However, bud growth was hyperpolarized, and most cells budded several times. The terminal phenotype of the sextuple clb mutant resembles that of cdc4, cdc34, and cdc53 mutants, which also arrest in G1 with multiple buds (Figure 2B). Induction of Clb5 with galactose caused the buds to adopt a more normal shape and prevented rebudding. In agreement with the results of Lew and Reed (1993), we conclude that Clbs are needed to specify the pattern of bud growth and to prevent rebudding.

Posttranslational Control of Clb5 Kinase in Early G1  

CLB5 transcripts are very rare in early G1 cells and only accumulate to high levels shortly before S phase. Premature expression of CLB5 from the GAL1 promoter does not advance the onset of DNA replication, suggesting either that Clb5 kinase is in fact insufficient to trigger S phase or that it is also regulated posttranscriptionally (Schwob and Nasmyth, 1993). For example, destruction box-mediated proteolysis of Clb2, which is initiated during mitosis, remains active during the subsequent G1 period until Cln cyclins are activated in late G1 (Amon et al., 1994). A similar phenomenon could affect accumulation of Clb5

protein in early G1 cells because it also contains destruction box-like sequences that contribute to its proteolysis in cdc28 mutants arrested in G1 (S. Irniger, personal communication).

To address whether cell cycle-regulated transcription and proteolysis are alone responsible for preventing premature activation of the Clb5 kinase, we constructed a version of Clb5 that is driven by the GAL1 promoter and lacks a putative destruction box (Clb5Δdb). Induction of Clb5Δdb in elutriated early G1 cells had no effect on the timing of DNA replication (see Figure 7B) even though much Clb5Δdb protein accumulated by 50 min, i.e., long before cells entered S phase (Figure 3). Interestingly, histone H1 kinase activity associated with Clb5Δdb did not appear until 70 min, at which time DNA replication commenced. Thus, Clb5 can accumulate in early G1 cells, at least when its destruction box is removed, but it cannot generate an active Cdc28 kinase. We conclude that Clb5–Cdc28 kinase is negatively regulated in early G1 by a post-translational mechanism, which would explain why premature Clb5 expression fails to advance S phase.

Clb–Cdc28 Kinases Are Inactive in cdc4, cdc34, and cdc53 Mutants

Because the phenotype of cdc4, -34, and -53 mutants resembles that of cells lacking B-type cyclins (see Figure 2B), we investigated whether they might be defective in the activation of Clb kinases. When expressed from the ADH promoter, high levels of Clb5 protein accumulated in wild-type and mutant strains grown at 25°C or 37°C (Figure 4). Wild-type cells contained similar levels of Clb5-associated H1 kinase activity at both temperatures. Kinase activity was present at 25°C but absent at 37°C in cdc34 and cdc53 mutants and was strongly reduced in cdc4 mutants. The lack of kinase activity in cdc34 mutants

is not due to a failure of Clb5 to interact with Cdc28 since the amount of Cdc28 protein coprecipitated with Clb5 was equal at both temperatures and similar to the amount found in wild type (Figure 4A). Similar results were obtained when Clb2-associated kinase activity was measured in wild-type and cdc34 mutants expressing CLB2 from the Schizosaccharomyces pombe adh promoter (Figure 4B). Despite the accumulation of Clb2 protein in the mutant cells at 37°C, the amount of kinase activity associated with this protein was much reduced compared with 25°C or with wild type at either temperature. The absence of Clb2–Cdc28 or Clb5–Cdc28 kinase activity in cdc34 mutants contrasts with the high levels of kinase associated with Cln cyclins in these mutants (Tyers et al., 1992).

G1 Cells Contain an Inhibitor of the Clb5 Kinase

Because CDC34 encodes a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme thought to promote proteolysis (Goebl et al., 1988), we reasoned that the inactivity of Clb kinases in cdc34 mutants might stem from their failure to destroy a Clb kinase-specific inhibitor protein. Such a protein might normally

be present in early G1 cells and prevent the premature activation of Clb5 kinase. To test this idea, we mixed crude extracts containing high levels of a hemagglutinin-tagged (HA-tagged) Clb5 protein from cycling cells with extracts from cells (lacking any HA tag) at various stages of the cell cycle. The tagged Clb5 protein was then immunoprecipitated, and histone H1 kinase activity was measured (Figures 5A and 5B). A 2-fold excess of extract from cycling cells added to the HAClb5 extract had no effect on the activity of Clb5. Extracts from cells arrested in S phase by cdc7 or cdc8, in G2 by cdc13, in metaphase by cdc16 or cdc23, or in anaphase/telophase by cdc15 mutations also failed to inhibit the kinase. In contrast, extracts from G1 cells, obtained either by centrifugal elutriation or by incubating cdc28, cdc4, cdc34, and cdc53 mutants at the restrictive temperature, caused a 5-fold reduction in the Clb5 kinase activity. We found a similar but less drastic inhibition of a tagged Clb2 kinase (data not shown). These data suggest that G1 cells, but not those from other cell cycle stages, contain an inhibitor of Clb–Cdc28 kinases, which could be responsible for the lack of Clb5 kinase in the cdc34 class of mutants and in early G1 cells expressing Clb5 protein. They also affect the interpretation of kinase measurements performed on imperfectly synchronous cultures since mixing G1 cells with S phase cells could mask the Clb5 kinase activity of the latter.

(B) The inhibitory activity depends on SIC1. Increasing amounts (20, 40, or 80 μg) of extracts from the following strains were added to 20 μg of K3819 (ADH–HA6CLB5) extracts (and kinase activity was measured): K699 (cycling wild-type [WT cycl]), K4083 (cdc34-2 37°C, arrested for 2.5 hr at 37°C) or (cdc34-2, elutriated G1 cells), K4163 (cdc34-2 sic1::HIS3), K3916 (GAL–CLB5ΔDBHA3, grown on raffinose), and K4137 (sic1::HIS3 GAL–CLB5ΔDBHA3, grown on raffinose) cells.

(C) Purified Sic1 inhibits the Clb5- and Clb2-associated kinases but not the Cln2 kinase in vitro. (Left) Sic1 purified from E. coli (bSic1, 1 μl of 125 μg/ml) was added (plus sign) or not added (minus sign) to 12CA5 immunoprecipitates from strain MDMy649 (sic1::HIS3 GAL–CLB5HA3) grown in the presence (gal) or absence (gluc) of galactose.

After 30 min incubation at 4°C, Clb2 or Cln2, Sic1, and their associated proteins were immunoprecipitated with the 12CA5 antibody, and H1 kinase activity was measured. In control lanes (pET), E. coli extracts from cells containing the empty vector were added.

Sic1-associated proteins were isolated on Ni<sup>2+</sup>/NTA beads and were analyzed by Western blotting using 12CA5 (for Sic1 and Clb5, top) or anti-Cdc28 (middle) antibodies; as a negative control, an extract was prepared from E. coli containing the empty vector (pET). The same HisHASic1 (3 μl of 10-, 100-, and 1000-fold dilution) was tested for inhibition of the Clb5–Cdc28 kinase (50 μg of ADH–HACLb5 extract) after immunoprecipitation with the 12CA5 MAb (bottom). The three leftmost lanes are control Western blots and immunoprecipitations.

The following cdc strains were used: K1990 (cdc28-4), K2018 (cdc4-1), K4083 (cdc34-2), K1838 (cdc53-2), K2032 (cdc7-1), K2537 (cdc8-1), K2035 (cdc13-1), K2530 (cdc16-1), K2532 (cdc23-1), and K1994 (cdc15-2).

is mutated (D. Knapp, personal communication), do not transcribe FAR1 (Chang and Herskowitz, 1990). Another candidate is p40, which was first described as a tightly bound substrate of Cdc28 (Reed et al., 1985) and was later found to be a potent inhibitor of the kinase (Mendenhall, 1993). p40 is encoded by the SIC1 gene (Nugroho and Mendenhall, 1994) and is present in G1 cells that contain the Clb5 kinase inhibitor. Deletion of SIC1 is not lethal, which enabled us to test whether the inhibitory activity of wild-type G1 or cdc34 cells depends on p40. Figure 5B shows that the inhibition exerted by both types of extract is abolished in sic1 mutants. Thus, p40<sup>Sic1</sup> alone could be responsible for the Clb5 kinase inhibitory activity present in G1 and cdc34 extracts.

To test whether p40<sup>Sic1</sup> directly inhibits the Clb5 kinase, we added p40 purified from Escherichia coli to 12CA5 immunoprecipitates from cells expressing an HA-tagged Clb5. Figure 5C shows that p40 is a potent inhibitor of the Clb5-associated kinase. To address the specificity of inhibition by p40<sup>Sic1</sup>, we purified from E. coli (on Ni<sup>2+</sup>/NTA beads, which bind histidine residues) a version of p40 containing six histidines and a single HA tag at its N-terminus (HisHASic1), and we added varying amounts to crude yeast extracts containing HA-tagged Clb2 or Cln2 cyclins. The Cdk complexes were immunoprecipitated with the 12CA5 MAb, and H1 kinase activity was measured. Clb2-associated kinase was inhibited by HisHASic1 but Cln2 kinase was not. Moreover, p40 was a good substrate for the Cln2 kinase (Figure 5C). This experiment suffers from the criticism that the inhibitor and cyclin were coprecipitated, which could either enhance or diminish the ability of HisHASic1 to act as an inhibitor. The data nevertheless suggest that p40 may be a specific inhibitor of Clb but not of Cln-associated Cdc28 kinases. This is consistent with the behavior of cdc34 mutants, which both bud and express genes regulated by the SBF and MBF transcription factors at the restrictive temperature (Amon et al., 1993). Both events depend on Cln cyclins, which must therefore be active in mutant cells in vivo despite the presence of the p40 inhibitor.

To determine whether p40<sup>Sc1</sup> forms complexes with Clb5, Cdc28, or both, we incubated the HisHAsic1 protein (pETSIC1) with yeast extracts containing an HA-tagged Clb5 and pulled down p40 using Ni<sup>2+</sup>/NTA beads. Western analysis performed on the beads revealed the presence of p40<sup>Sc1</sup>, Clb5, and Cdc28 proteins (Figure 5D). None of these proteins were found when the same experiment was repeated using extracts from E. coli cells that do not express p40 (pET). In the same extracts, Clb5-associated H1 kinase activity measured on 12CA5 immunoprecipitates was inhibited by HisHAsic1 in a dose-dependent fashion and not by control E. coli extracts. These data, along with those from Figure 4A showing that Clb5–Cdc28 complexes are inactive in cdc34 mutants, suggest that p40 inhibits the Clb5–Cdc28 kinase by forming ternary complexes with Clb5 and Cdc28.

### Disappearance of p40 at the G1 to S Boundary Depends on CDC34

SIC1-dependent inhibitory activity is high in G1 cells but undetectable in S, G2, and M phase cells. To determine how this pattern is generated, we analyzed the level of SIC1 transcripts and protein during the cell cycle. Yeast cells were arrested in late G1 by Cln cyclin deficiency and were induced to reenter the cell cycle synchronously by expressing CLN3 from the GAL1-10 promoter (Figure 6A). SIC1 transcripts were present at all stages of the cell cycle, but their abundance increased 3- to 4-fold as cells underwent division, shortly after the peak of SWI5 transcription in G2.

To detect p40<sup>Sc1</sup>, we replaced the endogenous SIC1 gene by a copy fused at its extreme C-terminus to sequences encoding a single HA epitope. This gene fusion was fully functional in vivo. Figure 6B shows the level of p40 during the synchronous outgrowth of G1 daughter cells isolated by centrifugal elutriation. p40 levels were high during early G1 but started to drop 30 min before initiation of S phase, were absent during S and G2 phases, and reappeared as cells underwent division. When the experiment was repeated using an otherwise congenic cdc34 mutant strain, cells budded at a larger cell size and ultimately formed multiple elongated buds but failed to enter S phase. p40 levels were initially similar to those seen in wild-type but remained high as the mutant cells budded and for 2 hr thereafter. Thus, the drop in p40<sup>Sc1</sup> levels in late G1 in wild type depends on CDC34.

We also analyzed the accumulation of p40 after shifting asynchronous cultures of wild-type and various cdc mutant cells from 25°C to 37°C (Figure 6C). Very little protein is found in wild-type cultures, presumably because they contain few early G1 cells. Furthermore, little or no p40 accumulates in cdc8, cdc13, cdc23, and cdc15 mutants during their S, G2, or M phase arrests. In contrast, p40<sup>Sc1</sup> accumulates to high levels in cdc28 and cdc34 mutants at 37°C. The protein migrated more rapidly in cdc28 in cdc34 mutants. The greater abundance of p40 in cdc34 cells (at 37°C) is not due to a corresponding increase in the level of SIC1 transcripts (data not shown).

---

### Effects of Deleting SIC1 on S Phase Entry

We next addressed whether accumulation of p40 in cdc34 mutants is alone responsible for their failure to enter S phase. We tested whether deleting SIC1 would allow cdc34 cells to undergo DNA replication. We isolated G1 cdc34 cells and congenic cdc34 sic1 cells by elutriation, and we incubated both at 37°C. The cdc34 single mutant cells failed to replicate even after 6 hr, whereas cdc34 sic1 double mutant cells replicated by 2 hr (Figure 7A) at the same size (44 fl) as congenic cdc34 cells grown at permissive temperature. These cells underwent what appears to be a complete round of DNA replication but largely failed to undergo nuclear division and accumulated as large budded cells with a single nucleus (data not shown). Thus, deletion of SIC1 allowed cdc34 mutants not only to enter S phase but also to depolarize their bud growth, and it prevented them from rebudding. It did not suppress the lethality of the cdc34-2 mutation, suggesting that CDC34 may have an essential function in addition to promoting p40 degradation. Deletion of SIC1 altered the phenotype of cdc4 and cdc53 mutants in a similar fashion, causing them to arrest with 2N DNA content and a single round bud (data not shown).

We also investigated whether p40 is responsible for preventing premature Clb5 kinase activation and DNA replication in early G1 cells when CLB5 is expressed from the GAL1 promoter. Addition of galactose to elutriated GAL-CLB5ΔDBHA cells did not advance S phase (Figure 7B). In contrast, galactose advanced entry into S phase by 25 min when the experiment was repeated with a congenic sic1 deletion strain (Figure 7C). SIC1 cells entered S with a volume of 26 fl with or without galactose. In contrast, galactose lowered the size at which sic1 cells entered S phase to 22 fl. Thus, inactivation of the SIC1 gene enabled early G1 cells that express Clb5Δdb ectopically to enter S phase at a smaller size than normal, i.e., to undergo premature DNA replication. When we repeated the same experiment in minimal medium to obtain more G1 cells, we found that deletion of SIC1 allowed Clb5 kinase to become active in early G1 cells with the same kinetics as Clb5 protein accumulation (Figure 7D; compare with Figure 3). DNA replication was triggered in most cells by 50 min in this experiment (data not shown), by which time only modest amounts of Clb5 protein had accumulated (i.e., to a level comparable to that found in wild type during late G1).

In the absence of ectopic CLB5 expression, sic1 cells entered S before they budded. The two events are simultaneous in wild-type cells (Figures 7B and 7C). However, since the cell size at which DNA replication began is similar in mutant and wild type, we cannot say whether S phase is advanced or whether budding is delayed in the mutant. SIC1 might be only one of several factors that prevents premature DNA replication in wild-type cells. We also noticed that sic1 cells take longer than wild type to complete S phase. In wild type, the distribution of DNA contents becomes bimodal very soon after S phase entry, whereas in the mutant, it drifts more slowly to the 2N position as a single peak.

Discussion

### Clb Kinases Are Necessary for Initiation of DNA Replication

Activation of the Cdc28 protein kinase by the G1-specific Cln1, -2, and -3 cyclins is required for budding, DNA replication, and spindle pole body duplication. Three additional genes, CDC4, CDC34, and CDC53, are more specifically required for S phase entry. CDC34 encodes a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (Goebl et al., 1988), suggesting that degradation of certain proteins might be important for initiating DNA replication.

The Cdc28 kinase is needed for both DNA replication and mitosis, and it was thought that these events were triggered by the successive activation of Cdc28 by G1-specific (Cln1, -2, -3) and G2-specific cyclins (Clb1, -2, -3, -4) (Nasmyth, 1993). This tidy picture was, however, jolted by the discovery of two novel B-type cyclins, Clb5 and Clb6, which are synthesized in late G1 along with Cln1 and -2 and which are needed for punctual DNA replication (Epstein and Cross, 1992; Schwob and Nasmyth, 1993). It was therefore suggested that the immediate trigger for S phase might not be activation of Clns but rather the activation of Clb5 and -6. There existed two problems with this hypothesis: S phase is merely delayed in a clb5 clb6 double mutant, and it fails to be advanced upon ectopic expression of CLB5. We have solved both problems by showing that Clb1-4 can substitute for Clb5 and Clb6 and that posttranslational regulation of the Clb5–Cdc28 kinase prevents premature DNA replication in G1.

Mutants lacking all six Clb activities form buds but fail altogether to enter S phase, despite having active Clns. Whereas Clns cannot trigger S phase in the absence of Clbs, ectopic expression of either Clb5 (Schwob and Nasmyth, 1993) or Clb2Δdb (Amon et al., 1994) can trigger S phase in the absence of Clns. Thus, Clb–Cdc28 kinases and not Cln–Cdc28 kinases may be the true S phase inducers. We presume that Clb5 and Clb6 fulfill this function

tionary phase on plates and were elutriated. Early G1 cells were then incubated in YEPD medium at 37°C, and DNA content was measured at the indicated times (in hours) after the temperature shift.

(B) Ectopic expression of Clb5Δdb does not cause premature DNA replication. Early G1 cells from strain K3916 (GAL–CLB5ΔDBHA3) were incubated in YEPR medium lacking galactose (raffinose, Raff, is present) or containing 2% galactose (Gal). Time was measured in minutes.

(C) Premature DNA replication in sic1 cells expressing Clb5Δdb. Early G1 cells from strain K4137 (sic1::HIS3 GAL–CLB5ΔDBHA3) congenic to K3916 were incubated in YEPR or YEPRG medium at 30°C at t = 0 min. DNA content (FACScan, top) and modal cell volume (bottom) were measured; peak cell volume at which about 30% of the cells in both cultures have replicated is indicated by an arrow. Raff., raffinose; fl, femtoliters; and Gal., galactose.

(D) Clb5 kinase activation parallels Clb5 protein accumulation in sic1 mutants. A culture from strain K4137 growing in minimal medium plus 2% raffinose was elutriated and early G1 cells put back in minimal medium containing raffinose and galactose at 30°C. (Top) Clb5 Western blot (20 μg); (bottom) Clb5-associated H1 kinase activity. The three leftmost lanes contain 20, 40 and 80 μg of protein from an asynchronously growing CLB5HA3 (K3889) culture.

in wild-type cells and that, in their absence, S phase is merely delayed until Clb1-4 accumulate to sufficient levels.

### Destruction of p40<sup>Sc1</sup> Is Needed for Clb Kinase Activation and S Phase Entry

Three different mechanisms prevent Clb kinases from becoming active in early G1. First, CLB genes are not transcribed until late G1 (CLB5 and CLB6), S (CLB3 and CLB4), or G2 (CLB1 and CLB2) phases (Koch and Nasmyth, 1994). Second, Clb cyclins are degraded as cells exit mitosis and, at least in the case of Clb2, remain unstable during the following pre-START G1 period (Amon et al., 1994). We have now discovered a third mechanism: Clb-Cdc28 kinases are kept inactive by an inhibitory protein, p40<sup>Sc1</sup> (Mendenhall, 1993), that accumulates as cells exit from mitosis and only disappears shortly before S phase by a process that depends on the Cdc34 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme. We have shown that both Clb2 and Clb5 proteins associate with Cdc28 in cdc34 mutants, but they fail to activate the kinase probably owing to the formation of ternary complexes with p40<sup>Sc1</sup> (Figure 4). The same may happen to Clb1, -3, -4, and -6, which would explain why cdc34 cells cannot enter S phase.

The phenotypes of cdc4, cdc34, and cdc53 mutants suggest that the inactivation of p40 in late G1 is an essential step for the initiation of DNA replication in yeast. cdc34 daughter cells are born with amounts of p40 (Figure 6) and SIC1-dependent inhibitory activity (Figure 5) that are comparable to the amounts in newly born wild-type cells, but neither p40 nor its inhibitory activity disappears in cdc34 cells when they would be expected to enter S phase. Crucially, the persistence of p40<sup>Sc1</sup> is largely if not solely responsible for the lack of DNA replication in cdc34 cells because deletion of the SIC1 gene allows them to enter S phase. Sufficient p40 exists in wild-type early G1 cells to prevent premature activation of Clb5 kinase and advancement of S phase (Figure 7) when CLB5 is expressed ectopically. Destruction of this protein is therefore likely to be essential for the G1 to S transition in wild-type yeast cells. Our data suggest that CDC4 and CDC53 also participate in the destruction of p40.

The abundance of SIC1 transcripts is not much altered in cdc34 mutants, implying that the persistence of p40 is due either to increased translation or to a lack of proteolysis. The latter seems more likely given that Cdc34 is a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme. cdc34 mutants may also be defective in the degradation of the G1 cyclin proteins Cln2 and Cln3 (Tyers et al., 1993; D. Finley and R. Deshaies, personal communication). The lack of Cln cyclin degradation in cdc34 mutants might not be relevant to their G1 arrest because deletion of SIC1 alone allows cdc34 cells to undergo DNA replication and because hyperactivation of Clns advances rather than delays S phase.

### Regulation of p40<sup>Sc1</sup> Levels

A key question is this: what triggers disappearance of the p40<sup>Sc1</sup> inhibitor during late G1? We found that prompt activation of the Clb5 kinase is critically dependent upon Clns. In cells lacking Clns and expressing Clb5Δdb from the GAL promoter, Clb5 kinase becomes active 105 min later than in cells expressing Cln2 from the MET3 promoter (data not shown). We do not yet know whether this delay depends on SIC1. Thus, Cln cyclins may play an important part in the activation of Clb5 kinase during late G1 in wild-type cells not only by promoting Clb5 synthesis but also by relieving inhibition of Clb5-Cdc28 complexes by p40<sup>Sc1</sup>. p40 is a substrate for the Cln2 kinase in vitro (Figure 5C). Furthermore, the p40 protein that accumulates in cdc28 mutants migrates more rapidly than the protein isolated from cdc34 mutants (Figure 6C), which possess active Cln kinases. If this difference were due to phosphorylation, it would indicate that p40 might be an in vivo substrate of Cln kinases. Deletion of CLN1 and CLN2 delays S phase but not the transcription of CLB5 (L. Dirick, personal communication), suggesting that the Cln1 and -2 kinases may be needed to trigger p40 degradation.

SIC1 is transcribed throughout the cell cycle with a peak around cell division (Figure 6A), but p40 disappears at the G1 to S transition and does not reappear until cell division (Figure 6B). It is not known what turns p40 degradation off and thereby triggers accumulation of p40 at the end of mitosis. It occurs around the same time as the onset of Clb2 proteolysis and may contribute to the inactivation of Clb kinases, which is thought to be necessary for exit from mitosis. The reappearance of p40 could explain why cells can exit from mitosis in the presence of moderate amounts of a nondestructible Clb2 protein (Amon et al., 1994). In this regard, it is interesting that the SIC1 gene has also been isolated as a multicopy suppressor of dbf2 mutants, which arrest in late anaphase (Donovan et al., 1994).

### Functions of p40<sup>Sc1</sup>

Cells lacking p40 are viable but have an increased frequency of broken and lost chromosomes. Daughter cells seem particularly afflicted and tend to arrest at a point late in the cell cycle (Nugroho and Mendenhall, 1994). It is currently unclear which aspect of p40<sup>Sc1</sup> function makes it important for nuclear division. p40 helps to prevent premature entry into S, and it may thereby prevent errors in DNA replication. p40 also seems important for the rapid completion of S phase. The slow DNA replication of sic1 mutants is similar to that of clb5 mutants. p40 might help to direct Clb kinases to appropriate sites within the nucleus or to ensure that they are activated synchronously or only when Clbs have accumulated to high levels. Thus, p40 may actually help Clb kinases to function even though it inhibits them.

If p40 proteolysis were normally dependent on the prior activation of Clns, then p40<sup>Sc1</sup> could also have an important role in ensuring that Clb kinases do not become active before Cln kinases. The latter are particularly important for bud formation, and premature activation of certain Clbs would interfere with this process (Amon et al., 1994). This might explain why budding is delayed relative to DNA replication in sic1 mutants. Another event that could be jeopardized by premature activation of Clb kinases is spindle pole body duplication. This early step of spindle formation may depend on Cln kinases since it

phase, which awaits activation of Clb–Cdc28 kinases upon p40 degradation. Phosphorylation of p40 by Cln1–Cdc28 and Cln2–Cdc28 kinases might trigger its degradation via the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Cdc34. It is currently unclear whether synthesis, protein stabilization, or p40 destruction limits the rate of Clb kinase activation in normal cells. These three processes could occur concurrently, and it is striking that all may depend on Cln–Cdc28 kinases. According to this model, Cln kinases control the kinetics of S phase entry, even though they are not the direct trigger for DNA replication.

Our results indicate that proteolysis is a key mechanism for regulating the G1 to S transition in yeast. It is likely that degradation of mitotic cyclins is required for exit from mitosis (Murray et al., 1989; Surana et al., 1993), and it is possible that degradation of other proteins might be required for sister chromatid segregation (Holloway et al., 1993). Why might cell cycle-regulated proteolysis be such a common theme? Because of its irreversibility, proteolysis may be an ideal mechanism for ensuring the procession of cell cycle events.

The discovery that B-type cyclins are inducers of S and M phases poses a question as to how cells determine the correct order of these two events. Any one of the six Clbs may be able to promote S phase. Clb5 seems most effective, but the occurrence of S phase, albeit slowly, in clb3 clb4 clb5 clb6 quadruple mutants suggests that Clb1 and Clb2 can perform the same function, which is consistent with the induction of DNA replication by Clb2Δdb in triple cln mutants (Amon et al., 1994). It is therefore conceivable, although heretical, that the simultaneous activation of one or more B-type cyclins (possibly Clb2 alone if it is sufficiently expressed) would be able to promote an orderly succession of chromosome duplication and segregation in yeast. Successive waves of different types of cyclin-dependent kinases might not after all be needed for ordering these two key cell cycle events. This could be relevant to the mechanism by which rereplication during G2 is avoided. Why would a kinase that is able to promote both S and M not promote a second S phase in G2 cells, and what then determines the timing of mitosis?

### Experimental Procedures

#### Strains, Media, and Reagents
All yeast strains were derivatives of or were at least backcrossed three times to W303 (HMLa, HMRa, ho ade2-1 trp1-1 can1-100 leu2-3,112 his3-11,15 ura3 ssd1). Cells were grown in YEP medium (1% yeast extract, 2% bactopeptone, 50 mg/l adenine) supplemented as indicated with 2% glucose (YEPD), raffinose (YEPR), or galactose (YEPG), unless otherwise stated. Minimal medium is yeast nitrogen base (0.8%) supplemented with amino acids, adenine, uracil, and sugar. Secondary antibodies were purchased from Amersham, and proteins were detected by an enhanced chemiluminescence system according to the manufacturer.

#### Plasmid Constructions and Genetic Manipulations
For tagging Clb5 at the N- or C-terminus, a NotI cassette containing three tandem repeats of the HA epitope (HA3; Tyers et al., 1992) was inserted after the initiation codon or before the termination codon of CLB5. The resulting plasmids, C2598 (HA6CLB5) and C2667 (CLB5HA3), were transplanted to the CLB5 locus of K3095 (clb5::URA3) by transformation and 5-FOA selection. A CLB5HA3 version lacking the nine amino acids (56–64) of the destruction box (Glotzer et al.,

1991) was generated by PCR (C2668), cloned under control of the GAL1 promoter to generate GAL-CLB5ΔDBHA3 (C2670), and then integrated at the URA3 locus of K699 to generate K3916.

For making the sextuple clb mutant, CLB6 was first disrupted by LEU2 (Schwob and Nasmyth, 1993) in the clb1-4 strain (K3080; Amon et al., 1993) to generate K3671. A truncated CLB5 gene driven by the GAL1 promoter in a URA3-based integrative vector was constructed by deleting a 1.0 kb ClaI fragment that removes the last 64 residues of Clb5 (C2711). After linearization (with BspEI), this plasmid was integrated at the CLB5 locus of K3671. Ura⁺ transformants were selected on raffinose plus 0.3% galactose plates lacking uracil at 25°C and were then scored for glucose lethality at 25°C. SIC1 disruptions are described in Nugroho and Mendenhall (1994). Sic1 was tagged at its N-terminus by inserting a triple HA cassette in a unique NotI site generated after the initiation codon (HA3SIC1, C2762). To tag Sic1 at the C-terminus, a fragment carrying a single HA epitope was inserted before the stop codon of SIC1 to generate C2801. This plasmid was then cut with EcoRI and XbaI and was transplaced at the SIC1 locus.

### Cell Synchronization

Centrifugal elutriations were performed as described previously (Schwob and Nasmyth, 1993). For the experiment in Figure 7A, elutriation was preceded by stationary phase presynchronization on YEPD plates (4 days at 25°C).

### Western Blot Analysis and Histone H1 Kinase Assay

Western blot analysis was performed as described in Surana et al. (1993). After transferring the proteins to Immobilion P membranes (Millipore), proteins were detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (ECL, Amersham). Dilutions of the antibodies were 1:100 for the 12CA5 MAb, 1:2000 for Clb2 antiserum, 1:2000 for Cdc28, and 1:40,000 to 1:200,000 for Swi6. For detection of Sic1HA1, the signal was amplified using a rabbit anti-mouse antibody (1:2500 or 1:5000, Jackson Immunoresearch). In experiments in which both Western blotting and H1 kinase assay were performed, the extracts prepared for the kinase assay were also used for Western blotting. Histone H1 kinase assays were performed as described previously (Surana et al., 1993).

### Purification of Sic1 from E. coli

Purification of native Sic1 from E. coli (bSic1) will be described elsewhere. To produce the double-tagged HisHASic1 protein, a HA1SIC1 fragment from C2762 was cloned into the pETKH1 vector (pET11d derivative; Studier et al., 1990). Induction results in the production of a fusion protein carrying six histidine residues and a single HA epitope at the N-terminus of Sic1 (pETSIC1, C2841). The pETSIC1 plasmid or the parental vector (pET) were transformed into BL21::DE3, and the fusion proteins were purified on Ni²⁺/NTA beads as described (Qia expressionist Handbook, Qiagen). The beads were washed three times with NP-40 lysis buffer (Amon et al., 1993) and twice with the same buffer containing 10 mM imidazole; bound proteins were eluted with 250 mM imidazole. The eluted solutions (referred to as pET and pETSIC1) were adjusted to 1 mg/ml (in 35% glycerol) and were stored at –80°C.

### Mixing and Kinase Inhibition Assay

Crude cell extracts from a strain overexpressing HA6Clb5 (K3819) were mixed with extracts from untagged wild-type cells, various cdc mutants, elutriated G1 cells, or E. coli purified p40SIC1. After 30 min incubation at 4°C, Clb5 was immunoprecipitated with the 12CA5 MAb (1:10 dilution), and histone H1 kinase activity was determined. Inhibition by p40SIC1 was performed in NP-40 lysis buffer with 2 mM MgCl₂ and without DTT (Amon et al., 1993). To show complex formation between p40SIC1, Clb5, and Cdc28, cell extracts containing HA6Clb5 (from K3819) were mixed with pET or pETSIC1 extracts and were incubated for 30 min at 4°C. Ni²⁺/NTA beads were then added, and the suspension was incubated for 1 hr at 4°C. Beads were collected by centrifugation and washed twice with NP-40 buffer and twice with NP-40 buffer containing 10 mM imidazole. Beads were boiled in SDS loading buffer, and the supernatant was used for Western blot analysis.

### Other Techniques

Flow cytometric DNA quantitation was determined according to Ep-

stein and Cross (1992) on a Becton-Dickinson FACScan. Cell size analysis was performed on a CASY1 Cell Counter Plus Analyzer (Model TTC; Schärfe System). Cells were fixed for 2 hr in 3.8% formaldehyde and 0.1 M potassium phosphate (pH 6.4). About 20,000 cells were counted, and peak cell volume (in femtoliters) was measured in duplicate.
