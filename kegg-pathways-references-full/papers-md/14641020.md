## Abstract

The central role of VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor A) in angiogenesis is dependent upon its ability to co-ordinately regulate multiple endothelial functions. The multifunctionality of VEGF at the cellular level results from its ability to initiate a diverse, complex and integrated network of signalling pathways via its major receptor, kinase-insert-domain-containing receptor (KDR). Activation of phospholipase C-γ, protein kinase C, Ca<sup>2+</sup>, ERK (extracellular-signal-regulated protein kinase), Akt, Src, focal adhesion kinase and calcineurin pathways has been implicated in mediating multiple VEGF functions, including survival, proliferation, migration, vascular permeability, tubulogenesis, NO and prostanoid synthesis, and gene expression. NO and prostanoids in turn play paracrine and autocrine roles in linking post-receptor signalling to biological functions. Integration between biologically important signalling cascades occurs at several points. Akt and ERK, for example, are key junction points linking together signal transduction involved in survival and NO generation, and proliferation and prostanoid biosynthesis. Together, the multiplicity, functional versatility and integration of VEGF signalling provide a useful framework for understanding the mechanisms underlying the endothelial biological response to this key factor.

## Introduction

The formation of a mature vasculature requires co-ordinated signalling between extracellular angiogenic factors and their surface receptors in endothelial cells. VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor A), and its major signalling receptor KDR (kinase-insert-domain-containing receptor), are essential for vasculogenesis, the differentiation of endothelial cell progenitors and their assembly into a primary capillary plexus, and for angiogenesis, or the sprouting of new capillaries from pre-existing vessels [1]. VEGF is also the most important mediator of neovascularization associated with diverse human diseases [2].

Consonant with its pivotal role in vascular development, VEGF is a multi-tasking cytokine, which stimulates differentiation, survival, migration, proliferation, tubulogenesis and vascular permeability in endothelial cells and exerts pleiotropic effects on diverse cell types and tissues [1–3]. Signal transduction mechanisms provide not only the intracellular triggers that initiate the multiple biological effects of this cytokine, but also the molecular circuitry that integrates

Figure 1 | VEGF family ligands and receptors

The RTKs that specifically recognize VEGF-A, Flt1 (VEGFR1) and KDR (VEGFR2), possess an extracellular domain containing seven Ig-like loops (red ovals), a single hydrophobic membrane-spanning domain, and a cytoplasmic domain comprising a single kinase domain (yellow ovals) that is interrupted by a non-catalytic region, called the kinase insert. The extracellular domain of Flt1 is also independently expressed as a soluble protein. VEGFs C, D and E also bind to KDR, while PlGF and VEGF-B bind to Flt1 only. Flt4 (VEGFR3) is a related receptor for VEGFs C and D that undergoes proteolytic processing to yield 120 and 75 kDa polypeptides with a disulphide bridge in the fifth Ig domain. NP-1 is a non-RTK receptor for VEGF<sub>165</sub>, the PlGF-2 isoform, VEGF-B and VEGF-E. NP-1 comprises an extracellular region with MAM (meprin, AS, μ tyrosine phosphatase) (or C), a and b domains, a transmembrane region and a short cytoplasmic domain.

and co-ordinates these functions in order to produce blood vessels. This article reviews progress towards the identification of VEGFR (VEGF receptor) signalling pathways, and will try to emphasize how signalling both explains biological function and serves to integrate diverse aspects of endothelial biology.

## VEGF ligands and receptors

VEGF is the prototypical member of a family of related growth factors, which includes VEGFs B, C and D, PlGF (placenta growth factor) and the orf virus-encoded factor, VEGF-E. Alternative splicing of human VEGF mRNA from a single gene containing eight exons produces at least five different isoforms of 121, 145, 165, 189 and 206 amino acid residues, of which VEGF<sub>165</sub> is the most abundant and biologically active form [3]. Striking confirmation of the crucial importance of VEGF for angiogenesis came from the discovery that loss of a single VEGF allele in mice causes a lethal impairment of vascular development [4,5].

Two RTKs (receptor tyrosine kinases) have been identified for VEGF, Flt1 or VEGFR1 (K<sub>d</sub>, 16–114 pM) and KDR or VEGFR2 (mouse equivalent, Flk-1; K<sub>d</sub>, 0.4–1 nM), which share 44% amino acid identity [6]. Both receptors consist of a cytoplasmic region containing a bipartite tyrosine kinase domain divided into two parts by an insert sequence, a single hydrophobic transmembrane domain, and an extracellular region comprising seven Ig-like domains (Figure 1). VEGF-C and -D also recognize KDR with lower affinity and bind to a third receptor, Flt4 (VEGFR3). PlGF and VEGF-B bind with high affinity only to Flt1, and VEGF-E only to KDR.

### VEGFR signalling

Most biologically relevant VEGF signalling in endothelial cells is mediated via KDR [7–11]. KDR is activated through ligand-stimulated receptor dimerization and trans(auto)phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic domain. Six autophosphorylation sites have been identified in KDR: Tyr-951 and Tyr-996 in the kinase insert, Tyr-1054 and Tyr-1059 in the kinase domain and Tyr-1175 and Tyr-1214 in the C-terminal tail [12–14]. The function of most of these sites has not been defined, but Tyr-951 associates with the SH2 (Src homology 2) domain protein,

VEGFR-associated protein, and Tyr-1175 is a binding site for PLC-$\gamma$ (phospholipase C-$\gamma$) [13, 14]. KDR has been shown to associate with other SH2 domain proteins, including Grb2, Nck and Shc and the protein tyrosine phosphatases SHP-1, SHP-2 and HCPTPA (human cellular protein tyrosine phosphatase A) [10, 15, 16]. Tyrosine phosphatase-mediated inactivation of KDR may provide a mechanism for regulation of KDR function. In support of this concept, tumour necrosis factor-$\alpha$-induced heterologous down-regulation of VEGF biological activities in HUVECs (human umbilical vein endothelial cells) was linked with increased association between SHP-1 and KDR [17].

### Survival signalling

A major pathway through which VEGF promotes endothelial cell survival is PI 3-kinase (phosphoinositide 3'-kinase)-dependent activation of the anti-apoptotic kinase, Akt/protein kinase B ([18, 19]; Figure 2). Akt in turn phosphorylates and inhibits the pro-apoptotic proteins Bad and caspase-9. Long-term survival effects of VEGF may be mediated through up-regulation of anti-apoptotic proteins, including Bcl-2 and A1 [20], and the IAP (inhibitors of apoptosis) proteins, survivin and XIAP (X-chromosome-linked IAP) [21], which act by inhibiting upstream caspases, and terminal effector caspases, respectively.

Akt appears to be a key point of integration between VEGFR signalling and other endothelial functions. Akt mediates VEGF-induced NO production via eNOS (endothelial constitutive nitric oxide synthase) phosphorylation at Ser-1179 [22, 23] and Akt survival signalling is also critically dependent on VE (vascular endothelial)-cadherin, the major component of endothelial adherens junctions [24]. Either deficiency or cytosolic truncation of VE-cadherin lethally impairs remodelling and maturation of embryonic blood vessels, effects associated with increased endothelial cell death, loss of KDR associations with VE-cadherin, $\beta$-catenin and PI 3-kinase, reduced Akt signalling and decreased Bcl-2 expression [24]. These findings suggest that KDR survival signalling is tightly coupled with the functional integrity of cell–cell endothelial adherens junction components once the early stages of blood vessel assembly are complete.

VEGF-dependent survival signalling is also directly linked to integrins (Figure 2). Integrin $\alpha_{v}\beta_{3}$ is an important survival system for nascent blood vessels during angiogenesis [25]. KDR has been reported to associate selectively with $\alpha_{v}\beta_{3}$ and VEGF mitogenicity and receptor activity were enhanced by endothelial adhesion to the $\alpha_{v}\beta_{3}$ ligand, vitronectin [26]. Although $\beta_{3}$-null mice exhibited no defects in retinal neovascularization [27], it is possible that other integrins compensate for loss of interactions between KDR and $\alpha_{v}\beta_{3}$. This may not be surprising given that $\alpha_{1}\beta_{1}$ and $\alpha_{2}\beta_{1}$ have also been implicated in mediating VEGF-dependent angiogenesis [28]. Since VEGF increases tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK (focal adhesion kinase) [29], and FAK is a major component of $\beta_{3}$ and $\beta_{1}$ integrin signalling pathways, activation of FAK might also contribute to VEGF survival signalling (Figure 2).

### Mitogenic signalling

VEGF is a strong activator of ERKs (extracellular-signal-regulated protein kinases) 1 and 2 via KDR and the presumption that this pathway plays a central role in angiogenesis is supported by the finding that specific inhibitors of MEK1/2 (mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase 1/2), the kinase responsible for ERK activation, reduce endothelial tubulogenesis *in vitro* ([30], and H. Jia and I. Zachary, unpublished work). The major pathway through which RTKs activate ERKs involves Grb2 tyrosine phosphorylation, subsequent stimulation of the guanine nucleotide exchange protein SOS and Ras activation, leading to activation of the Raf-1/MEK/ERK cascade. There is strong evidence, however, that KDR activates ERK via a Ras-independent pathway involving PLC-$\gamma$ ([14, 31, 32]; see Figure 2). VEGF induces strong PLC-$\gamma$ tyrosine phosphorylation and activation, leading to generation of diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and subsequent activation of PKC (protein kinase C) and Ca$^{2+}$ mobilization. Activation of c-Src was reported to mediate VEGF signalling through PLC-$\gamma$ [33], although it is unclear how c-Src couples with and activates PLC-$\gamma$. VEGF induces Ras-independent induction of the ERK pathway whereas PKC inhibitors block VEGF-induced activation of ERK1/2 and MEK [31, 32]. Furthermore, residue Tyr-1175 is essential for KDR association with PLC-$\gamma$, and VEGF-induced PLC-$\gamma$ tyrosine phosphorylation, ERK activation and mitogenesis [14]. Several studies also show that PKC inhibition using either pharmacological inhibitors or antisense oligonucleotides to PKC-$\alpha$ and PKC-$\zeta$ isoforms blocks VEGF mitogenic signalling [34–36], and diverse PKC inhibitors block VEGF-induced angiogenesis *in vitro* [37].

There is some evidence for cross-talk between the ERK and JNK (c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase) pathways in VEGF mitogenic signalling. VEGF activates JNK and expression of a dominant-negative JNK-1 mutant inhibited VEGF-induced thymidine incorporation, while the dominant-negative Y185F ERK2 mutant blocked JNK activation [38].

As Figure 2 shows, the bifurcating PLC-$\gamma$ pathway also plays a crucial role in endothelial production of NO and prostacyclin (PGI$_{2}$). ERK mediates VEGF-induced activation of cPLA$_{2}$ (cytosolic phospholipase A$_{2}$) [11], a key rate-limiting step in release of arachidonic acid and its subsequent conversion to prostanoids via COX (cyclooxygenase), and PKC inhibitors block VEGF-induced and ERK-mediated cPLA$_{2}$ activation and PGI$_{2}$ production [32]. Ca$^{2+}$ mobilization is essential for VEGF-induced PGI$_{2}$ production probably because of its role in exocytotic release of cellular PGI$_{2}$ [32]. Ca$^{2+}$ signalling also mediates short-term NO production through activation of the constitutive eNOS isoform. Ca$^{2+}$-independent NO production is mediated via Akt, and may also involve VEGF-induced up-regulation of eNOS mRNA [39], while long-term prostanoid production is mediated through VEGF-induced expression of the inducible COX-2 isoform via Ca$^{2+}$/calcineurin-dependent activation of the transcriptional regulator, NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T-cells) [40]. NO and PGI$_{2}$ have been implicated in several biological effects of VEGF, including

Figure 2 | VEGF signalling pathways

Most, if not all, biologically relevant VEGF signalling is mediated via KDR. Activation of KDR occurs through ligand-induced dimerization and receptor autophosphorylation at multiple tyrosine residues in the intracellular domain. VEGFR-associated protein (VRAP) and PLC-γ associate with Tyr-951 and Tyr-1175, respectively, but the role of other sites is yet to be defined, although KDR associates with several other SH2 domain proteins (yellow ovals). VEGF-dependent endothelial cell survival is mediated in part via PI 3-kinase (PI3K)-mediated activation of the anti-apoptotic kinase Akt, though the mechanism of PI 3-kinase activation is unclear. Akt phosphorylates and inhibits the pro-apoptotic protein Bad, leading to inhibition of caspase activity. Akt also causes Ca²⁺-independent eNOS activation through phosphorylation, and this pathway may also be essential for migration. Increased tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK, mediated in part through Src, is a point of convergence for VEGF and integrin-mediated survival and migration signalling. Direct interactions between integrin αᵥβ₃ and KDR may also play a role in survival functions of VEGF. A major mitogenic signalling mechanism for VEGF is the PLC-γ pathway resulting in hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, generation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP₃) and diacylglycerol, and subsequent mobilization of intracellular Ca²⁺ and PKC activation. PKC mediates activation of ERKs 1/2 via Raf-1 and MEK, and this pathway is a major mediator of both mitogenesis and cPLA₂ activation leading to generation of COX-derived prostaglandins (PGs), including PGI₂ and PGE₂. Ca²⁺ signalling is also important for eNOS activation and NO generation, and activates the serine/threonine phosphatase, calcineurin (protein serine/threonine phosphatase 2B), leading to activation of the transcription factor NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T-cells) and induction of COX-2, which mediates long-term prostaglandin production. Functional signalling converges and branches at several points, emphasizing how linear signalling pathways are integrated to form signal transduction networks.

angiogenesis, increased vasopermeability, hypotension and local arterioprotection [3].

### Chemotactic signalling

FAK is a key transducer of signals converging from integrins and RTKs important for both survival and migration ([3]; see Figure 2). VEGF induces tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK and the focal adhesion-associated protein paxillin to promote recruitment of FAK to new focal adhesions in HUVECs [29,41]. VEGF increases FAK phosphorylation at Tyr-397 and Tyr-861, but selectively stimulates Tyr-861 phosphorylation via a Src-dependent pathway, and

Src inhibition impairs VEGF-induced cell migration and survival [41]. A dominant-negative Src construct selectively inhibited VEGF-induced angiogenesis and reduced VEGF-dependent survival in the chick CAM (chick chorioallantoic membrane) model, without affecting the angiogenic response to fibroblast growth factor-2 [42]. Src is also required for VEGF-stimulated formation of a complex between FAK and integrin αvβ5 [43]. Though angiogenesis is normal in mice lacking individual Src family kinases, these findings indicate important roles for Src-dependent FAK signalling in VEGF-induced angiogenesis and endothelial cell migration and survival. The roles of redundancy and compensatory mechanisms between Src family kinases may help to account for the absence of vascular defects in individual Src kinase-knockout mice.

A role for VEGF-induced p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase activation in endothelial cell migration is suggested by the finding that the p38 kinase inhibitor SB203580 inhibited actin reorganization and cell migration, whereas the MEK inhibitor PD90059 had no influence on these biological effects [44]. NO may also play a role in VEGF-induced endothelial cell migration (Figure 2). NO regulates non-chemotactic movement (podokinesis) of endothelial cells and VEGF-induced endothelial cell migration [45], and has been shown to regulate focal adhesion integrity and FAK tyrosine phosphorylation in endothelial cells [46]. Akt-dependent phosphorylation of eNOS at Ser-1177 was also shown to be required for VEGF-induced cell migration [47].

Small GTPases of the Rho family play important roles in cell migration and other cellular functions. KDR has been shown to mediate activation of RhoA and Rac1, and dominant negative RhoA and Rac1 mutants inhibit the migration of HUVECs in response to VEGF. The mechanism involved in KDR-mediated Rho/Rac activation is unclear, but appears to be independent of Ca²⁺ and PI 3-kinase signalling pathways, and may occur via the heterotrimeric G-protein Gq/11 [48].

## Permeability signalling

A role for Src in regulating vascular permeability is indicated by the finding that mice deficient in either pp60c-src or the β5 integrin subunit, but not β3-deficient mice, display a reduced vascular permeability response to VEGF [42]. Roles for NO and PGI₂ in regulating vascular permeability are supported by the observations that COX and eNOS inhibitors reduced permeability changes induced by VEGF *in vivo* [3].

Mechanisms that have been proposed to mediate VEGF-induced permeability include increased formation of caveolae, small vesicles called vesicular–vacuolar organelles, and fenestrae, specialized regions of the plasma membrane highly permeable to small solutes and present in the endothelia of kidney glomeruli and a few other specialized vascular beds [3]. The signalling pathways mediating these processes are poorly understood, however. VEGF-induced phosphorylation of components of adherens and the tight junctions may be a mechanism through which endothelial cell–cell adhesions are disrupted, leading to increased vasopermeability [3,49].

## Flt1 signalling

It remains enigmatic whether Flt1 is able to transduce a biologically meaningful signal. Flt1 is a weaker kinase than KDR, and though specific phosphorylation sites have been identified, their function is unclear [2,3]. In Flt1-expressing endothelial cells, Flt1 can mediate tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-γ and activation of ERK, but several studies have yielded varying results [3]. Overall, it can be concluded somewhat tentatively that Flt1 is able to mediate limited signalling initiated by VEGF, but does so much more weakly than KDR. The specific Flt1 ligand, PlGF, also seems to be noticeably weaker than VEGF in stimulating signalling pathways [50], and biological roles for either PlGF or Flt1 signalling have not been unambiguously established. Whereas KDR-deficient mice produce neither differentiated endothelial cells nor haematopoietic precursors [51], the primary defect in Flt1-null mice is an over-production of endothelial progenitors [52], suggesting that Flt1 may function as a ‘decoy’ receptor to negatively regulate KDR-mediated actions of VEGF [2]. Several other lines of evidence support this view. Mice expressing only the extracellular region of Flt1 and lacking its kinase domain develop normally [53], suggesting that Flt1 intracellular signalling is dispensable for embryonic angiogenesis. Flt1-mediated signalling and biological function is constitutively suppressed by a motif within the juxtamembrane domain [2], and Flt1 may also directly modulate KDR-mediated biological responses [54]. The extracellular domain of Flt1 is also expressed naturally in soluble form and inhibits angiogenesis by forming an inactive complex with VEGF [2]. Recent evidence supports a positive biological role for the PlGF/Flt1 axis in pathophysiological angiogenesis [55], but the nature of the signal transduction pathways remains to be determined.

## NP (neuropilin)

NP-1 is a non-tyrosine-kinase receptor for the VEGF₁₆₅ isoform (*K*~d~, 0.3 nM), but not VEGF₁₂₁ [56], and also binds the heparin-binding PlGF-2 isoform, VEGF-B and VEGF-E (Figure 1). NP-1 is expressed in endothelial cells, several tumour cell types and certain neurons, and was originally identified as a receptor for semaphorin 3A, a member of a family of polypeptides involved in axonal guidance and patterning. NP-1 consists of a short cytoplasmic domain, a single transmembrane domain and a large extracellular region comprising a C domain which shares identity with MAM (meprin, AS, μ tyrosine phosphatase) domains found in diverse proteins thought to mediate homophilic protein–protein interactions, b1 and b2 domains related to the C1 and C2 domains of coagulation factors VIII and V, and a1 and a2 domains related to the non-catalytic regions of complement components C1r and C1s (Figure 1).

Overexpression of NP-1 in mice results in increased capillary formation, vasodilation and malformation of the heart, whereas mice deficient in NP-1 exhibit defects in embryonic axonal patterning and vascular abnormalities including defective development of large vessels and impaired neural and

yolk sac vascularization [57]. Inactivation of both NP-1 and NP-2 causes a more severe failure of embryonic vascularization resulting in death at embryonic day 8.5. Co-expression of NP-1 with KDR in endothelial cells increased binding of VEGF<sub>165</sub> 4-fold and enhanced chemotaxis and mitogenicity of VEGF<sub>165</sub> [56]. However, despite the strong evidence that NP-1 is essential for normal vascular development, the underlying mechanisms remain obscure, and the role of NP-1 in the endothelial functions of VEGF are not fully understood.

The small size of the NP-1 cytoplasmic domain and the lack of any associated signalling function suggests that NP-1 by itself is not a functional receptor but acts as a co-receptor. However, in a yeast two-hybrid screen a conserved C-terminal PDZ-binding motif in the NP-1 cytosolic domain was found to associate with NIP-1 (NP-1-interacting protein-1), a PDZ domain protein identical with GIPC [RGS (regulator of G-protein signalling)-GAIP (Gα-interacting protein)-interacting protein], synectin and the semaphorin F-binding protein Semcap1 [58]. Whether interactions between synectin or other PDZ domain proteins and NP-1 transduce biological signalling is as yet unclear.

be determined by differences in the amplitude and duration of particular signalling events, synergistic or regulatory interactions between them, and by spatio-temporal regulation of expression of angiogenic factors and their receptors.

Much also remains to be learnt about how early signalling events in angiogenesis are hard-wired to cellular functions and long-term biological responses. Gene (and protein) expression will play a key role in this respect, and elucidation of the gene expression profiles of VEGF and other angiogenic molecules is already in progress [60,61]. The step-change in knowledge generated by current genomic and future proteomic analysis will transform our understanding of angiogenic signalling by providing crucial insights into the mechanisms underlying both the distinct biological roles of key factors and how these mechanisms are linked and co-ordinated to form the system of integrated signalling networks necessary for blood vessel formation.

# Conclusions and perspectives

The complex interaction between multiple cellular processes during vascular development requires that VEGF initiates a complex array of signalling events, and that the information relayed from VEGFRs is highly integrated and coordinated. The preceding discussion has tried to highlight the multifunctionality and integration of VEGF signal transduction mechanisms. It is apparent that cascades of kinases, biosynthetic enzymes and adapter proteins converge and branch at many points in functional VEGF signalling, emphasizing how linear pathways can integrate to form signal transduction networks (Figure 2).

If multi-tasking and integrated signalling go some way towards an understanding of the functional versatility of VEGF, it remains to be resolved how intracellular signalling determines the distinct biological responses evoked by different angiogenic factors such as VEGF and Ang1 (angiopoietin 1). Part of the answer is that while individual signalling responses are common to different ligand receptor systems, the total complement of signalling cascades triggered by different factors is unique. A striking difference between VEGF and Ang1, for example, is the inability of Ang1 and its receptor Tie2 to activate the ERK pathway and its corresponding inability to promote cell proliferation [59]. Ang1 is able to promote Akt-mediated endothelial cell survival, but VEGF stimulates other signal transduction pathways, including PLC-γ activation, that so far have not been identified downstream of Tie2. These differences help to explain the role of Ang1/Tie2 as a vascular stability factor, whereas VEGF alone produces unstable and leaky vessels. While distinct signalling repertoires are likely to play a major role in producing specific biological effects, further fine-tuning may
