**ABSTRACT**

It is well established that cancer is a multi-step process which involves initiation, promotion and progression. Chemical carcinogens can alter any of these processes to induce their carcinogenic effects. The presence of multiple mutations in critical genes is a distinctive feature of cancer cells and supports the contention that cancer arises through the accumulation of irreversible DNA damage. In the majority of instances, chemical carcinogens, directly or after xenobiotic metabolism, induce DNA damage and act in a ‘genotoxic’ manner. There is, however, a group of carcinogens that induce cancer via non-genotoxic mechanisms. Non-genotoxic carcinogens have been shown to act as tumor promoters (1,4-dichlorobenzene), endocrine-modifiers (17β-estradiol), receptor-mediators (2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin), immunosuppressants (cyclosporine) or inducers of tissue-specific toxicity and inflammatory responses (metals such as arsenic and beryllium). The diversity of modes of action of non-genotoxic carcinogens, the tissue and species specificity, and the absence of genotoxicity makes predicting their carcinogenic potential extremely challenging. In order to better understand the mechanisms of known human non-genotoxic carcinogens and to illustrate the importance of a weight of evidence approach when evaluating their carcinogenic potential, we will (1) evaluate the proportion of non-genotoxic carcinogens among known, probable and possible human carcinogens classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), (2) estimate the risk of exposure of human non-genotoxic carcinogens through margin of exposure (MOE) evaluation, and (3) discuss potential alternative methods for their detection. Our analysis demonstrated that human non-genotoxic carcinogens were present in 12% (45/371) of IARC’s Groups 1, 2A and 2B carcinogens and that a potential hazard was associated with 27% (12/45) of them. Consequently, it is suggested that for all genotoxic chemicals, the mode of action is investigated for hazard and risk evaluation. Further, if negative genotoxic compounds have putative non-genotoxic modes of action, appropriate risk measures should be implemented.

### 1. Introduction

Cancer is presumed to arise from the accumulation of multiple mutations, now believed to be in growth-regulatory genes [1] such as the tumor suppressor p53 [2] or the proto-oncogene ras [3]. In this multi-step and multi-hit theory, initiated cells accumulate and those with a growth advantage, in comparison to non-initiated cells, expand and can become malignant resulting in tumors [1]. The mutator phenotype hypothesis postulates that cancer cells have an increased error rate during DNA synthesis possibly from mutations in genes governing genetic stability such as those involved in DNA repair, DNA replication, chromosomal segregation or cell cycle checkpoints [4–6]. Evidence for this is the high cancer rates detected in individuals with human genetic disorders in genes responsible for maintaining genetic stability. For instance, high colon cancer rates are detected in individuals with hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer (HNPCCP), a heritable mutation in the HNPCC gene and in mismatch repair genes MutL Homologue 1 (MLH1) and MutS Homologue 2 (MSH2) and MSH6 [7,8]. High colon cancer rates are also detected in individuals with familial adenomatous polyposis, a heritable mutation in the tumor suppressor adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) or a mutation in the DNA repair enzyme MUTYH [1,9]. High skin cancer rates are detected in individuals with mutations in the nucleotide excision repair gene Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) [10], while many breast carcinomas are caused by deficiencies in homologous recombination and double strand break repair genes such as BRCA1 and BRCA2 [11].

Most chemical carcinogens are capable of inducing DNA damage and are 'genotoxic' in their carcinogenic mode of action. There is, however, a group of carcinogens that induce cancer in a non-genotoxic manner. Little is known about this group of carcinogens but evidence from known non-genotoxic carcinogens suggests that in a high proportion of them, multiple pathways need to be altered for cancer induction. Among the processes that non-genotoxic carcinogens have been shown to alter/induce include, but are not limited to, tumor promotion, endocrine modification, immune suppression, and tissue-specific toxicity and inflammatory responses [12,13]. Unlike genotoxic carcinogens which share a unifying characteristic that is genotoxicity, non-genotoxic carcinogens can have diverse modes of action which are, for the most part, tissue and species specific. Traditionally, non-genotoxic carcinogens have been detected in rodent 2-year cancer bioassays but in the midst of a new European policy that deals with Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH), the number of cancer bioassays will be significantly reduced. In addition, the test strategy for carcinogenicity of REACH is based on genotoxic endpoints including the Ames mutagenicity test in bacteria, genotoxicity in mammalian cells under in vitro and in vivo conditions, and germ cell mutagenicity tests. Non-genotoxic carcinogens are negative [14] in these tests and thus go undetected. In view of these new regulatory changes, a better understanding of the mechanisms leading to cancer induction by non-genotoxic carcinogens is needed to assess the carcinogenic potential of new and existing substances.

In order to better understand the mechanisms of known human non-genotoxic carcinogens and to illustrate the importance of a weight of evidence approach when evaluating their carcinogenic potential, we will (1) evaluate the proportion of non-genotoxic carcinogens among known, probable and possible human carcinogens classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), (2) estimate the risk of exposure of known non-genotoxic carcinogens through margin of exposure (MOE) evaluation, and (3) discuss plausible alternative methods for their detection.

### 2. What is the proportion of non-genotoxic carcinogens among human carcinogens classified by IARC?

The proportion of human carcinogens classified by IARC that may act in a non-genotoxic manner was evaluated. In IARC, chemicals are categorized in:

- **Group 1: Carcinogenic to humans (105 agents)**
  - 61 chemicals, 9 viruses or pathogens (i.e. HIV), 16 mixtures (i.e. coal-tars) and 19 exposure circumstances (i.e. chimney sweeping).
- **Group 2A: Probably carcinogenic to humans (66 agents)**
  - 50 chemicals, 2 viruses or pathogens, 7 mixtures and 7 exposure circumstances.
- **Group 2B: Possibly carcinogenic to humans (248 agents)**
  - 224 chemicals, 4 viruses or pathogens, 13 mixtures and 7 exposure circumstances.
- **Group 3: Not classifiable as to its carcinogenicity to humans (515 agents)**
  - 496 chemicals, 11 mixtures and 8 exposure circumstances.

Among these, 878 chemicals and mixtures of IARC Groups 1 (77 agents), 2A (57), 2B (237) and 3 (507) were evaluated for their genotoxicity. Carcinogens that were negative for only Ames in the National Toxicology Program ([http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/](http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/)) or in the Carcinogenicity Potency Database ([http://potency.berkeley.edu/](http://potency.berkeley.edu/)) were selected. Negative results for the Ames test in the NTP or CPD were found in 21 out of 77 (27.3%) Group 1 carcinogens, 4 out of 57 (7%) Group 2A carcinogens, 52 out of 237 (21.9%) Group 2B carcinogens and 64 out of 507 (12.6%) Group 3 carcinogens (Supplemental Table 1). Therefore, 16.1% (141/878) of IARC Group 1, 2A, 2B and 3 had negative results for mutagenicity in the NTP or CPD.

From this, an additional list was generated to include compounds that were negative for Ames (Table 1) and for the mouse lymphoma assay (MLA), in vitro chromosomal aberrations test, in vitro micronucleus test (MN), in vivo MN test or in vivo

chromosomal aberrations test in rodent bone marrow in the NTP (Table 2). Results from in vivo rodent transgenic mutation assays [15] were also incorporated (Table 2). When there was no information available in addition to negative Ames, a negative genotoxicity result was assumed.

A non-genotoxic carcinogen was defined as a substance that was negative for genotoxicity in the NTP and CPD. After this analysis, 13 out of 77 (16.9%) IARC Group 1, 2 out of 57 (3.5%) IARC Group 2A, 30 out of 237 (12.7%) IARC Group 2B, and 36 out of 507 (7.1%) IARC Group 3 carcinogens had negative results for all genotoxicity tests (Table 3). A total of 81 out of 878 (9.2%) compounds were negative for genotoxicity (Table 3). Given that IARC Groups 1, 2A and 2B represent known, probable and possible human carcinogens, respectively, focus will remain in exploring the mechanisms of action of these carcinogens that have overall negative genotoxic results (Table 4).

## 3. Modes of action of human non-genotoxic carcinogens

Non-genotoxic carcinogens are substances that induce cancer through indirect stimulation of hyperplastic responses, without altering DNA, chromosome number or structure. Non-genotoxic carcinogens have a wide variety of mechanisms of cancer induction including receptor-mediated endocrine modulation, non-receptor mediated endocrine modulation, tumor promoting, inducers of tissue-specific toxicity and inflammatory responses, immunosuppressants, or gap junction intercellular communication inhibitors. The diversity of modes of action for each non-genotoxic carcinogen, the tissue specificity, and the absence of genotoxicity makes their identification and characterization very challenging. Further, the kinetics of human risk assessment is not like genotoxic carcinogens where low-dose linearity with a linearized multistage mode is used, but rather a non-linear approach (threshold) is applied. In view of the various mechanisms of action of non-genotoxic carcinogens, human cancer risk assessment is done on a case-by-case basis using a weight of evidence approach using data from 90-day toxicity studies, toxicokinetic and disposition studies, and when available 2-year chronic bioassays in rodents and human epidemiological data.

### 3.1. Endocrine modifiers

#### 3.1.1. MOA for receptor-mediated endocrine modifiers

Many human non-genotoxic carcinogens are endocrine modifiers by binding to receptors such the estrogen receptor (estrogenic hormones such as estradiol), progesterone receptor (progestins, medroxyprogesterone acetate), the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (i.e. 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), 1,4-dichlorobenzene) or the thyroid hormone receptor (“non-dioxin-like” polychlorinated biphenyls).

Estrogenic hormones such as 17β-estradiol (E2), along with its hydroxylated metabolites 2-hydroxyestradiol (2-OHE2) and 4-hydroxyestradiol (4-OHE2) bind to the estrogen receptor (ER) and induce strong mitogenic effects by altering ER-mediated genomic or/non-genomic pathways. In the genomic pathway, estrogen exerts its function by forming homo-or heterodimers complexes with ERα and ERβ, and the subsequent binding of these complexes to estrogen response element (ERE) sequences in the promoter region of estrogen-responsive genes. In addition, ERα and ERβ can also regulate the transcription of some genes independent of ERE by interacting with other DNA-bound transcription factors [16]. In the non-genomic pathway, estrogen can bind to ER located in the plasma membrane, or other non-ER plasma membrane-associated estrogen-binding proteins resulting in the induction of cellular responses such as increased levels of calcium or nitric oxide and the activation of multiple intracellular kinase cascades including

In some instances, multiple receptors can be modulated by non-genotoxic carcinogens such as in the case of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT). DDT is a pesticide that disrupts the endocrine system, promotes hormone-dependent pathology [19], and induces CYP2BandCYP3A in a sex-related manner suggestive of a possible role of cytochrome P450s in endocrine disruption [20]. DDT is a xenoestrogen that binds to the ER to elicit estrogenic actions [21] and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl) ethylene (p,p'-DDE), the major metabolite of DDT, is associated with breast tumor aggressiveness [22]. In addition to binding to the ER, DDT isomers are also capable of inhibiting androgen receptor function resulting in potent androgenic antagonistic actions [23]. The ability of compounds to bind to multiple receptors needs to be kept in mind when evaluating the mode of action of chemical carcinogens. DDT also reduces gap-junctional intercellular communications (GJICs) in rat and mouse hepatocytes [24]. In humans, there are elevated incidences of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and lung cancer in workers exposed to DDT [24].

The carcinogenic effect(s) of progesterone and therapeutic progestins (medroxyprogesterone acetate) in breast cancer development are also considered.

opment and progression is not fully understood. Progesterone and therapeutic progestins interact with other steroidal receptors such as the androgen receptor, the mineralocorticoid receptor and the ER [25]. Furthermore, the progesterone receptor (PR) is induced by estradiol in many target tissues [25] and they are useful prognostic indicators of breast cancers likely to respond to anti-estrogen receptor therapies [26]. Recent studies indicate that protein kinases are key mediators of PR action and the interactions between PR and membrane-initiated signaling events regulate mitogenic stimuli in hormonally responsive normal tissues. Deregulation of any of these interactions may contribute to breast cancer biology in humans [26].

TCDD is a human carcinogen which binds and activates the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), a ligand-dependent transcription factor, by forming a heterodimer with the Ah receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT). The Ah-TCDD-ARNT complex binds to regulatory sequences and alters their expression [27]. Treatment with TCDD has been associated with increased expression of ras, erbA, c-fos, c-jun and other cyclin-dependent kinases [28]. Further, TCDD has been shown to induce CYP1A1, glutathione-S-transferase Ya subunit, aldehyde dehydrogenase and quinine reductase [27]. In terms of carcinogenicity, TCDD induces tumors in the liver, thyroid, oral cavity and lungs in rats, and in the liver, thymus and skin in mice [28]. Human epidemiological studies indicate an increased risk in lung cancer, soft tissue sarcoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma and several other malignant neoplasms in herbicide producers exposed to TCDD [29]. The observed effects caused by ‘coplanar’ ‘dioxin-like’ polychlorinated biphenyls are similar to effects caused by TCDD and related halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons [30,31].

‘Non-dioxin-like’ PCBs act as “phenobarbital-inducers” independent of the AhR. These PCBs are potent CYP inducers, in particular human CYP1A2 [32] and CYP2B1, 2B2 or 3A resulting in toxic effects [30]. “Non-dioxin like” PCBs and polybrominated biphenyls (PBBs) modulate the endocrine system by binding directly to thyroid hormone receptors (TRs), inhibiting deiodinase, or displacing T4 from the serum-binding protein transthyretin [33]. No hepatic DNA adducts have been detected in mice [34] but the formation of reactive oxygen species and induction of lipid peroxidation in rat hepatocytes has been demonstrated [35]. In addition, “non-dioxin-like” PCBs inhibit GJICs in WB-F344 rat epithelial cells [30,36]. Similar thyroid effects are detected with hexachlorobenzene [31].

It is evident that an imbalance in estrogen, progesterone or thyroid hormone homeostasis coupled with cytotoxicity, regenerative hyperplasia and inhibition of GJICs may be key events that result in the induction of promoting effects that may ultimately lead to cancer.

### 3.1.2. Non-receptor mediated endocrine modifiers

Several anti-thyroid drugs such as 6-propyl-2-thiouracil, 6-methyl-2-thiouracil, and thiourea increase the incidence of thyroid tumors in rodents by disrupting the biosynthesis or secretion of thyroid hormones. Goitrogenic agents/drugs such as central nervous system-acting drugs (phenobarbital), calcium channel modulators (γ-1,2,3,4,5-hexachlorocyclohexane), chlorinated hydrocarbons (chlordane), polyhalogenated biphenyls (polybrominated biphenyls), and enzyme inducers increase the peripheral metabolism of thyroid hormones. Levels of thyroid hormone can also be disrupted by xenobiotics that inhibit the 5′-monodeiodinase, an enzyme responsible for converting T4 in peripheral sites such as the liver and kidney, to biologically active T3. Inhibition of 5′-monodeiodinase results in reduced levels of circulating T3 levels with a concurrent compensatory increase in the secretion of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). High levels of TSH may be responsible for inducing follicular cell hypertrophy and hyperplasia, and follicular cell tumors in 2-year cancer bioassays in rats [37], and may be important in the generation of thyroid tumors.

#### 3.2. Tumor promotion

Numerous non-genotoxic carcinogens have tumor promoting activity but other mechanisms such as cytotoxicity, regenerative hyperplasia or induction of oxidative damage are essential for cancer to occur. In the case of PCBs, tumor promotion, cytotoxicity and regenerative hyperplasia, and inhibition of GJICs have been demonstrated to be key events in PCB-induced cancer [38]. Similar non-genotoxic mechanisms are seen with dimethylarsinic acid and monosodium methane arsenate where tumor promoting activity [39], cytotoxic and regenerative hyperplasia [40,41], alterations in DNA methylation (hyper- or hypomethylation), inhibition of DNA repair [42] and inhibition of GJICs [43] drive the carcinogenic process. The stimulation of cell cycle progression, especially the G₁/S transition, together with the downregulation of p53 suggests that cells exposed to arsenic may enter cell cycle with unrepaired DNA lesions [42]. The inhibition of DNA repair and the accelerated G₁/S transition, make arsenic compounds strong tumor promoters. It is important to note that arsenic itself induces deletions, chromosomal aberrations, aneuploidy, and sister-chromatid exchanges, whereas some arsenic compounds such as dimethylarsinic acid and monosodium methane arsenate are presumed to act in a non-genotoxic mechanism as previously outlined, although dimethylarsinic acid has shown weak genotoxic effects at very high doses, particularly in the presence of oxygen [44]. This dual mechanism of tumor promotion and cytotoxicity is also detected with 1,4-dioxane [45], hexachloroethane [46], polychlorinated biphenyls [38] and the chlorinated hydrocarbon insecticide and flame retardant mirex [47].

Tumor promotion and oxidative stress are believed to be key events of non-genotoxic carcinogens. Pentachlorophenol is a wood preservative, an herbicide and an insecticide which generates reactive oxygen species during metabolism, mainly through the generation of the hydroxyl radical-derived 8-oxodeoxyguanosine in mouse and rat liver [48,49]. Evidence has accrued indicating that pentachlorophenol has tumor promoting, but not initiating activity [50]. Furthermore, it has been suggested that the induction of oxidative stress drives tumor promotion by inducing a compensatory hepatocellular proliferation [50]. Mitogenic induction by lead acetate coupled with renal cytotoxicity (possibly induced by the generation of reactive oxygen species) and regenerative hyperplasia may be responsible for carcinogenesis [51]. The involvement of oxidative stress in lead neurotoxicity has been demonstrated by the amplification of glutamate-induced oxidative stress, possibly through the activation of protein kinase C [52] and activation of the MAPK cascade [53]. Cytotoxicity coupled with induction of oxidative damage is also detected with nitrobenzene [54], 1,4-dichlorobenzene [55] and catechol [56].

Overall, it is evident that tumor promotion alone may not be sufficient for carcinogenesis but the presence of cytotoxicity and regenerative hyperplasia, or oxidative stress may be key events that drive the carcinogenesis process by non-genotoxic carcinogens.

#### 3.3. Tissue-specific toxicity and inflammation

The induction of tissue-specific toxicity resulting in inflammation and regenerative hyperplasia may be important modes of action of some non-genotoxic carcinogens. For instance, renal cytotoxicity induced by the chelating agents such as nitrilotriacetic acid and nitrilotriacetic acid trisodium monohydrate are caused by changes in the Zn²⁺ and Ca²⁺ ions in renal cells resulting in regenerative hyperplasia and renal cancer [57,58]. Beryllium-
induced cancer may be related to chronic beryllium disease, a granulomatous lung disorder characterized by the accumulation of beryllium-specific CD4⁺ T cells in the bronchoalveolar lavage [59]. The induction of an immune response and regenerative hyperplasia, the upregulation of cancer-related genes and the downregulation of genes involved in DNA synthesis, repair and recombination may all be critical for the induction of beryllium-induced cancer [60]. Other examples include gallium arsenide where cytotoxicity, immune response modulation and inflammation are presumed to be important for carcinogenesis [61], and vanadium pentoxide where the presence of chronic inflammation and interstitial fibrosis is suggestive of a pertinent role of these mechanisms in the induction of lung cancer [62,63].

As seen previously with tumor promotion where additional mechanisms are needed for carcinogenesis, the same is observed with cytotoxicity where the presence of inflammation, regenerative hyperplasia, and/or immune response modulation is necessary to drive the carcinogenesis process by non-genotoxic carcinogens.

### 3.4. Cytotoxicity and immune suppression

The induction of cytotoxicity and immune suppression may be crucial events in the induction of cancer by non-genotoxic carcinogens. Cyclosporine is a lipophilic cyclic polypeptide and an immunosuppressant drug which produces calcium-dependent inhibition of transcription of interleukin-2 and several other cytokines such as T-helper lymphocytes. Post-transplant malignancy is presumed to involve impaired immune surveillance of neoplastic cells and depressed antiviral immune activity [64]. Treatment of adenocarcinoma cells with cyclosporine A results in the induction of phenotypic changes such as the invasion of non-transformed cells while treatment with monoclonal antibodies against transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) inhibits these phenotypic changes and reduces the number of metastases. These results suggest that immunosuppressant drugs like cyclosporine A can elicit direct cellular effects that can lead to the promotion of cancer, independent of immune reactivity. Further, the cyclosporine-induced generation of TGF-β is presumed to be an important event in the cancer progression [65].

Phenytoin is an antiepileptic drug that has been shown to induce tumors in mice [66]. Studies using human peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from healthy volunteers and exposed *in vitro* to phenytoin resulted in a significant suppression of natural killer cell activity, depression of interferon augmentation of natural killer cell cytotoxicity and of antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. These results are suggestive of pronounced immunosuppression of natural killer cell and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity activity in patients receiving antiepileptic therapy such as phenytoin. Neoplasm development may result by a direct interaction with cellular DNA and/or an indirect mechanism by immunosuppression [67].

### 3.5. Inhibition of gap-junction intercellular communications (GJICs)

Gap junctions are comprised of proteinaceous, plasma membrane channels that link the interiors of adjacent cells and allow the direct exchange of small molecules (<1000 Da) and ions between them. This communication between cells is important in the maintenance of homeostasis by controlling cell differentiation and proliferation [68]. Many non-genotoxic carcinogens exhibit an inhibition or reduction in GJICs. For instance, chlordane, a hydrocarbon insecticide and a strong inhibitor of GJICs, is often used as a positive control for the measure of GJIC inhibition [69]. TCDD has been shown to inhibit GJICs in MCF-7 breast cancer cells by increasing the phosphorylation of connexin 43 (Cx43) via the protein kinase C alpha signaling pathway [70]. A different mode of action is observed in human mammary epithelial cells whereby TCDD altered the localization of Cx43 from the cytosol towards the perinuclear membrane [70]. Among the non-genotoxic carcinogens that exhibit inhibition of GJICs are DDT [24], pentachlorophenol [71], phenobarbital [24], polybrominated biphenyls, butylated hydroxyanisole [43], peroxisome proliferators (Wy-14643 and DEHP) [72], acetamide [73], phenytoin, mirex [47], nickel and arsenic compounds [43].

### 3.6. Other mechanisms

There are several substances that have unique or not fully established modes of action. For instance, the model non-genotoxic carcinogen carbon tetrachloride (CCl₄) is a hepatotoxicant that induces fatty degeneration, fibrosis, hepatocellular death, and carcinogenicity. CCl₄ is activated by CYP2E1, CYP2B1 or CYP2B2, and possibly CYP3A, to form the trichloromethyl radical, CCl₃*. This radical can bind nucleic acids, proteins and lipids and disrupt crucial cellular processes. DNA-CCl₃* adducts are presumed to be important in hepatic cancer initiation. Oxygen radicals, such as the trichloromethylperoxy radical CCl₃OO*, are highly reactive and may initiate lipid peroxidation reactions and destroy polyunsaturated fatty acids. CCl₄ is consistently positive in inducing recombination and aneuploidy in fungi and inducing liver DNA adducts presumably as a result of oxidative and lipid peroxidation [74]. CCl₄ also induces hypomethylation, inhibits protein synthesis, and activates tumor necrosis factor-α, nitric oxide, and transforming growth factors α and β in the cell [75].

Despite the fact that some nickel compounds have weak genotoxic activity, most nickel (II) compounds are presumed to induce cancer via non-genotoxic mechanisms. Epigenetic events elicited by nickel compounds such as nickel sulfate hexahydrate, nickel (II) oxide or nickelocene include induction of DNA hypermethylation, the Hypoxia Induced Factor-1α transcription factor, hypoxic stress, inhibition of histone acetylation, alteration of iron homeostasis, depletion of ascorbate [42], and inhibition of GJICs [43]. Gene silencing of tumor suppressor genes (*i.e.* p53, Fhit and p16) via hypermethylation of their promoters may be important in the induction of nickel-induced cancer [42]. Nickel compounds can also act as tumor promoters by enhancing the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of DNA-damaging agents through the inhibition of DNA repair, in particular nucleotide and base excision repair pathways [42].

Perchloroethylene (PCE) is a commonly used solvent in the dry cleaning industry and in industrial degreasing operations. The evidence for increases of cancer incidence of any type in human epidemiological studies is unclear. Several epidemiological studies have demonstrated elevated risks for esophageal cancer, non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and cervical cancer. Important species difference exists, indicating that humans may be relatively less sensitive to the cancer-causing effects of PCE than rodents. The carcinogenic effect of PCE is probably due to the generation of the metabolite trichloroacetic acid (TCA). In mice and rats, TCA induces hepatocellular peroxisomes, while humans are relatively insensitive to this compound and other peroxisome proliferators. Peroxisome proliferation is believed to induce cancer, nevertheless the exact mechanism of this induction is not yet known [76]. Although PCE is known to induce peroxisome proliferation in mouse liver, a poor quantitative correlation was seen between peroxisome proliferation and tumor formation in the liver after administration of PCE by inhalation. The induction of leukemia in rats is indicative of an alternative mode of carcinogenic action [77].

Butylated hydroxyanisole is a food antioxidant metabolized to tert-butylhydroquinone (TBHQ) and tert-butylquinone (TBQ) in the liver. The carcinogenic mechanism remains unknown but possiblecontributors include oxidative damage induced by TBQ [78] and gap-junction effects [43].

Although CCl₄ and some nickel compounds alter gene expression by inducing hypo/hypermethylation and also disrupt the maintenance of genomic integrity, more research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms of CCl₄-, nickel, PCE-, and butylated hydroxyanisole-induced cancer.

### 4. Importance of mode of action and weight of evidence approach

Previously we have described the presumed modes of action associated with the induction of cancer by human non-genotoxic carcinogens. In each case, the most pertinent key events have been illustrated in order to better understand the mechanisms leading to cancer induction. Given their many modes of action, it was evident that a weight of evidence approach is essential for proper human hazard identification and characterization.

The importance of weight of evidence approach could not be more clearly demonstrated than in the instances were substances were reported to be negative for genotoxicity in the NTP and CPD databases and where the mode of action is presumed to be genotoxic. For instance, ethanol was negative for mutagenicity in the NTP and CPD (only Ames results were available), but the carcinogenicity of ethanol is associated with the generation of acetaldehyde, a genotoxic substance in mammalian cells, and an inducer of chromosomal aberrations and sister-chromatid exchanges in human cells [79]. Another example is chromium carbonyl [Cr(CO)₆], a carcinogen and tumor promoter [80] that is genotoxic and generates DNA adducts, DNA-protein and DNA inter-strand cross-links, and single-strand DNA breaks [42]. Microsatellite instability and the loss of expression of MLH1, an essential protein involved in mismatch repair (MMR), are unique features of Cr(VI)-associated cancers [42]. These findings are suggestive that chromium carbonyl may act in a genotoxic manner. Other examples were the weight of evidence is suggestive of a genotoxic mode of action include chloroprene [81], Ponceau 3R [82], sodium ortho-phenylphenate [83], griseofulvin [84–86], ochratoxin A [87,88], vinyl acetate [89], and nitromethane [90]. It is possible that some of these chemicals are genotoxic by mechanisms that are not fully understood such as the case of chemicals that induce carcinogenicity via non-covalent DNA binding or interfere with DNA metabolism as in the case of topoisomerase inhibitors, DNA polymerase inhibitors and ribonucleotide reductase inhibitors.

The weight of evidence approach is also important when evaluating the human relevance of non-genotoxic carcinogens given that there are rodent non-genotoxic carcinogens present in IARC group 3 that are not carcinogenic to humans. In this regard, the weight of evidence approach is used to establish mechanistic differences between rodents and humans. Dose- and species-related carcinogenic effects are seen with sodium saccharin, a low calorie artificial sweetener. In very high doses (30 000 mg/kg body weight (bw)–75 000 mg/kg bw), induces bladder tumors in male rats but not in female rats or mice. The species- and sex-difference is possibly due to the formation of sodium saccharin-induced crystals in male rats when saccharin is given at high doses. Saccharin binds to silicates and proteins causing cell damage in the urinary bladder, which induces cellular proliferation and tumor formation. Humans, on the other hand, consume very low levels of saccharin (5 mg/kg bw/day) and for this reason no cancer risk would be predicted [91,92].

Another example where the weight of evidence approach is important is when evaluating the human relevance in the context of species differences between rodents and humans. For instance, the food additive d-limonene which induces α₂μ-globulin accumulation and renal carcinogenesis in F344 male rats but not in female rats or mice is not a human carcinogen. The binding of d-limonene and the metabolite d-limonene-1,2-oxide to α₂μ-globulin induces hyaline droplet formation in renal proximal tubules. Tumor formation in F344 male rats is associated with hyaline droplet-induced nephropathy that leads to atypical hyperplasia and atypical tubules. Similarly, 1,2-dichlorobenzene induces renal carcinogenesis only in male rats. Male F344 rats are very proteinuric in comparison to humans, female rats and other species such as mice [93]. Further, no human urinary protein similar to α2μ-globulin has been identified. Taken together, the mechanism of d-limonene- and 1,2-dichlorobenzene-induced renal tumors is unique to male rats and no human cancer risk would be expected with either compound [12,93,94].

Other examples of species differences and where the weight of evidence approach is used to establish human relevance include peroxisome proliferators di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP) and Wyeth-14643 which induce liver tumors in rats and mice [12]. Peroxisomes are subcellular organelles containing oxidative enzymes that generate hydrogen peroxide and catalase. It has been suggested that peroxisome proliferation alone does not account for the high incidence of liver tumors given that rats treated with DEHP and Wyeth-14643 produce similar levels of peroxisome proliferation, have different carcinogenic responses. Tumors induced by Wyeth-14643 have a shorter latency period and higher tumor multiplicity [12]. Studies have shown that the murine peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR)α increases the mRNA expression of PCNA, cMYC, cJUN, CDK4 and other cyclins. Consequently, murine hepatocarcinogenesis has been postulated to involve the downregulation of the microRNA let-7c gene, resulting in elevated levels of c-myc [95]. In humans, peroxisome proliferators such as clofibrate, ciprofibrate and gemfibrozil are used to treat cardiovascular disease [96]. The World Health Organization cooperative trial using clofibrate demonstrated an excess of deaths from non-malignant diseases of the liver, gall bladder and intestine in the clofibrate group in comparison to controls [97]. Therefore, peroxisome proliferators are generally not associated with human hepatocarcinogenesis. PPARα-humanized mice treated with Wy-14643 showed no downregulation of let-7c as observed with murine PPARα, and showed resistance to peroxisome proliferator-induced cell proliferation and cancer [95]. Species differences in response to peroxisome proliferators between mice and human PPARα appear to be associated with their ability to downregulate let-7c.

Overall, not all rodent carcinogens are carcinogenic to humans and it is evident that human risk assessment should be made on a case-by case basis taking into account the mechanism of action of each non-genotoxic carcinogen with a weight of evidence approach.

### 5. Human cancer risk assessment

Human cancer risk assessment is generally based on low-dose extrapolation of the risk of chemical carcinogens based on the mode of action:

#### A. Genotoxic carcinogens
I. DNA reactive (direct) → Clearly DNA reactive and initiating → No threshold → Linear approach for risk assessment  
II. Non-DNA reactive carcinogens (indirect) (*i.e.* aneugens, spindle and topoisomerase poisons) → True threshold likely  

#### B. Non-genotoxic carcinogens → True threshold likely [98,99].

Cancer risk assessment is performed by comparing a measured or estimated human exposure to a dose associated with a carcinogenicity endpoint, such as the no observed adverse effectlevel (NOAEL) or a benchmark dose (BMD), after adjustment for safety factors such as extrapolation from animals to humans and/or inter-individual variation in sensitivity [98]. An important aspect of cancer risk assessment involves the evaluation of available data to obtain information on the mode of action leading to carcinogenicity. This analysis is important for the assessment of human relevance, existence of thresholds and comparability with other structurally related carcinogens [100]. For indirect (non-DNA reactive) and non-genotoxic carcinogens, with sufficient mechanistic information a NOAEL and safety factor of 100 is justified [99,100]. The European Chemical Agency uses the derived no-effect level (DNEL) or the derived minimal effect level (DMEL) as their risk assessment parameters. The DNEL is the level of exposure to a substance below which no adverse effects are expected to occur. The DNEL is considered a derived exposure because it is calculated from the NOAEL or BMD. The DMEL is applied for non-threshold effects with the underlying assumption that a no-effect-level cannot be established and it represents an exposure level corresponding to a low, possibly theoretical, risk which is considered a tolerable risk. In general, dose–response assessment of non-genotoxic carcinogens involves an evaluation within the range of tumor observations to identify the toxicological effects responsible for carcinogenesis by analyzing and evaluating the risk estimates across all tumor types, reviewing any available information on the mode of action, and evaluating the anticipated human relevance associated with each tumor type. Once the most sensitive tumor endpoint is selected, it is used for a dose–response assessment which is the extrapolation to lower dose levels that mimic human exposures [100].

### 5.1. Margin of exposure (MOE)

In order to address the potential hazard associated with human non-genotoxic carcinogens, the margin of exposure (MOE) was estimated. The MOE is defined as the ratio of a risk assessment parameter obtained from animal studies to the anticipated human exposure level [101]. The risk assessment parameter selected for our analysis was the TD<sub>10</sub>, a dose associated with an extra lifetime tumor risk of 10%. The TD<sub>10</sub> has been selected as the benchmark dose by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) because it is the lowest estimate of statistically significant increases in tumor incidence [102,103]. Thus, the MOE may be obtained from the ratio between the Lower-bound Toxic Dose (LTD<sub>10</sub>) (a lower 95% confidence limit on the Toxic Dose (TD<sub>10</sub>)) and the anticipated human exposure level. The harmonic mean of the LTD<sub>10</sub> was obtained from the Carcinogen Potency Database (CPD) ([http://potency.berkeley.edu/](http://potency.berkeley.edu/)). In the instances where human exposure levels were not available, reference dose values (RfD, a reference dose with uncertainty factors of a daily exposure to the human population including sensitive sub-groups that is likely to be without appreciable risk of deleterious effects during a lifetime) were utilized for MOE calculations. Similarly, in the instance where LTD<sub>10</sub> values were not available, the NOAEL was used for MOE evaluation.

In Europe, a possible human hazard is associated with non-genotoxic carcinogens that have an MOE lower than 100 (10× for inter- and 10× for intraspecies variation). A cut-off value of 100 is justified because non-genotoxic carcinogens are presumed to have a threshold dose–response [99,100]. In this regard, our analysis (Supplemental Table 2) demonstrated a possible human hazard with exposure of dimethylarsenic acid, ethyl estradiol, ethanol, lead acetate, acetamide, carbon tetrachloride, catechol, 1,4-dichlorobenzene, griseofulvin, phenytoin, 6-propyl-2-thiouracil and vinyl acetate. This represented 27% (12/45) of carcinogens that were negative for genotoxicity in IARC Groups 1, 2A and 2B, and ~3.2% (12/371) of all the carcinogens in IARC Groups 1, 2A and 2B.

In the US, the EPA considers an MOE greater than 100 000 to be low risk for carcinogenicity, an MOE of 10 000 to 100 000 to be moderate risk, and an MOE less than 10 000 to be high risk; with a remedial action taken if the theoretical human risk exceeds an acceptable lifetime cancer risk of one in one ten thousand cases (1:10<sup>4</sup>) ([http://www.epa.gov/OSA/spc/pdfs/rchandbk.pdf](http://www.epa.gov/OSA/spc/pdfs/rchandbk.pdf)). MOE analysis using this framework resulted in 2% (1/45) of non-genotoxic carcinogens in the low risk category, 4% (2/45) of carcinogens in the moderate risk category and 49% (22/45) of carcinogens in the high risk category. Thus, non-genotoxic carcinogens with a potential human hazard (*i.e.* medium and high categories) were found in 6.5% (24/371) of all the carcinogens in IARC Groups 1, 2A and 2B, in comparison to 3.2% (12/371) when using the European MOE framework. Clearly, a worldwide consensus regarding the MOE cut-off values for non-genotoxic carcinogens has not been reached and this discussion is beyond the scope of this review. Overall, a potential hazard was associated with 27% (12/45) of non-genotoxic carcinogens using the European MOE framework, and with 49% (22/45) of non-genotoxic carcinogens using the American framework. It is noteworthy that the use of the BMD approach [104] to model dose–response data from carcinogenicity studies of non-genotoxic carcinogens is an alternative method for the derivation of risk parameter estimates and may provide some insight on the kinetics of non-genotoxic carcinogens. Nevertheless, the CPD provides an accepted standardized method of carcinogenic potency and the derived TD<sub>50</sub> and LTD<sub>10</sub> values are believed to be good risk assessment parameters for MOE derivation [103,105–109]. Finally, our results were limited to available human exposure and RfD values given that 20/45 (44%) lacked such data and thus, we cannot rule out the possibility that a possible human hazard may be associated with more compounds.

Traditionally, because of the various mode of action of non-genotoxic carcinogens, human cancer risk assessment has been done on a case-by-case basis using a weight of evidence approach from 90-day toxicity studies, toxicokinetic and disposition studies, and 2-year chronic bioassays in rodents. There is, however, a global sense to minimize the use of animal testing, especially for carcinogenicity studies which are very costly and require hundreds of animals for long periods of time (over 2 years). For instance, in Europe, the implementation REACH has reduced the number of cancer bioassays significantly [14] and the carcinogenic potential for new and existing chemicals is based on their genotoxic properties (for compounds with a lower production volume). Also, in Europe no animal testing is permitted in the cosmetic industry. Given that our analysis demonstrates that non-genotoxic carcinogens may have a potential human hazard, that data from a 2-year carcinogenicity assay are often lacking and that non-genotoxic compounds score negative in genotoxicity tests, alternative methods need to be explored for the identification of potential non-genotoxic carcinogens among new and existing chemicals for proper hazard characterization and risk analysis.

### 6. Alternative methods for detecting non-genotoxic carcinogens

Justification for the development of alternative methods for the detection of non-genotoxic carcinogens include their overall presence (12%, 45/371, Table 3) in Groups 1, 2A and 2B of IARC, the high proportion present (16.9%, Table 3) in the known human carcinogens (IARC Group 1) and the potential risk associated with them (MOE < 100 in 27%, 12/45, of carcinogens that were negative for genotoxicity in the NTP and CPD, and in 3.2 %, 12/371, of all carcinogens in IARC groups 1, 2A and 2B). If genotoxicity is the sole base for determining the carcinogenic potential of substances, as it is in the case of the new European policy REACH, then methods for the detection non-genotoxic
carcinogens need to be explored and considered for proper human cancer risk and hazard assessment [14].

When searching for alternative methods for the detection non-genotoxic carcinogens, consideration needs to be made to their wide spectrum of modes of action (Table 5) including mitogenic induction, inhibition of gap-junctional intercellular communications, endocrine modifiers, oxidative stress, immunosuppressants, regenerative proliferation and/or DNA methylation. Several alternative methods have been suggested for the detection of non-genotoxic carcinogens. Among these (quantitative) structure–activity relationships [(Q)SARs], measurements of replicative DNA synthesis as an indicator of cell proliferation, the in vitro cell transformation assays, measurements of inhibition of GJICs and the use of gene expression profiles with mechanistic networks for the identification of potential markers of non-genotoxic carcinogens.

### 6.1. Structure–activity relationship (SAR)

Structure–activity relationship (SAR) models for detection of non-genotoxic carcinogens use several markers of in vitro cell toxicity including inhibition of gap-junctional intercellular communications, modulation of apoptosis, and induction of cellular proliferation [110]. In this study, the structural features of the non-genotoxic carcinogen associated with toxicity or ligand binding, as in the case of estrogen, peroxisome proliferators and tubulin protein receptors, have been analyzed [110]. This information is used for quantitative structure–activity relationship ([Q]SAR) where chemical structure is quantitatively correlated with a defined process, such as biological activity or chemical reactivity. A major assumption in this model is that similar molecules have similar activities. For regulatory analysis, (Q)SAR models must satisfy the principles outlined by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) [111,112]. Briefly, (Q)SAR models must have a defined endpoint, an unambiguous algorithm, and measures of goodness-of-fit, robustness, predictivity, and applicability domain should be known to the regulator.

A SAR analysis has been done for a variety of natural, synthetic and environmental estrogens. Structural comparisons of endogenous 17β-estradiol with xenoestrogens showed that a rigid ring structure and the 3-position H-bonding ability of phenols is a significant requirement for estrogen receptor binding [113]. This study provided distinguishing criteria that can be used for the identification of potential estrogens. A SAR analysis of 10,000 chemicals representative of the “universe of chemicals” investigated mechanistic similarities between toxicological phenomena such as inhibition of GJICs, binding to aryl hydrocarbon receptor, α2μ-globulin-mediated nephropathy, inhibition of CYP2D6, skin permeability, Salmonella mutagenicity, SOS DNA repair, rodent carcinogenicity, developmental toxicity in humans, developmental toxicity in hamsters, allergic contact dermatitis, eye irritation, sensory irritation, respiratory hypersensitivity, rat LD₅₀, cell toxicity in HeLa cells and cell toxicity in BALB/c-3T3 cells. Results indicated that inhibition of GJICs may arise from inflammation, cell toxicity and/or cell proliferation and regenerative hyperplasia [114]. This study suggests that inhibition of GJICs may be used a putative marker for the identification of non-genotoxic carcinogens.

Given that non-genotoxic carcinogens have a wide range of modes of action, development of (Q)SAR models identifying various models from various laboratories are needed [110]. Although (Q)SAR models offer an in silico approach for detecting non-genotoxic carcinogens, the wide spectrum of mechanism of actions suggests that a large number of (Q)SAR models need to be developed for proper (Q)SAR analysis.

### 6.2. Replicative DNA synthesis (RDS)

Numerous non-genotoxic carcinogens are mitogenic inducers resulting in an increase in cellular proliferation. In vivo studies using rat hepatocytes indicate that many non-genotoxic hepatocarcinogens have tumor promoting activity resulting in accelerated hepatocyte division [115–118]. A comprehensive screening analysis measuring replicative DNA synthesis (RDS) of 41 putative non-genotoxic hepatocarcinogens (based on negative Ames data only) in rodents demonstrated a positive RDS result in 32 (78%) of the non-genotoxic hepatocarcinogens including chlordane, para-dichlorobenzene, DDT, mirex, pentachlorophenol, hexachloroethane and hexachlorobenzene in mice. Studies in rats have shown positive RDS results with DDT, estradiol, α-hexachlorocyclohexane, 1,4-dioxane, and polybrominated biphenyls [118]. The major advantages of the RDS test are the in vivo response to the agent in question and the short-term nature of the assay. The major disadvantages include the high doses required to attain responses, the false-positives obtained because of regenerative cell proliferation due to acute toxicity, and the false-negative results obtained if the liver is not the primary target for the agent in question [118]. Given the high degree of false positives and negatives, the RDS test should be performed in conjunction with other short-term tests for validation of results. The correlation between significant increases in RDS and carcinogenesis may be enhanced by additional measurements of apoptotic cell rate [119].

### 6.3. In vitro cell transformation assay

The in vitro cell transformation assays in BALB/c 3T3, C3H10T1/2, or Syrian Hamster Embryo (SHE) cells, detect the carcinogenic potential of a chemical by their ability to cause morphologic transformation [120]. Correlation between in vivo carcinogenicity and the in vitro transformation of BALB/c 3T3, C3H10T1/2 and SHE cells have been done. Validation studies indicate that SHE > C3H10T1/2 > BALB/c 3T3 cells in relation to sensitivity, specificity, predictivity and validity for the detection of non-genotoxic carcinogens [121]. Overall, the SHE transformation assay offers many advantages over other test systems including the normality of the cells, low spontaneous transformation, capacity for metabolic activation, rapidity of phenotypic changes, and reproducibility of results with the same chemical [120]. The major disadvantage is that the events that lead to the induction of cell transformation are not fully understood and thus that results from in vitro cell transformation assays need to be evaluated with caution. Further disadvantages include the inter- and intralaboratory variation due to subjectivity in the scoring of transformed cells, the periodic preparation of primary cultures because cells from various preparations differ in transformation capacity, variation in cloning efficiency and transformation frequency due to composition of fetal calf serum, and the use of an initiation-promotion protocol in order to enhance the transformation frequency [120].

Given that most non-genotoxic carcinogens are mitogenic inducers, treatment with an initiating agent is sometimes necessary to detect the promoting effects of a chemical. The use of initiated cells (v-Ha-ras-transfected BALB/c 3T3 cell line, Bhas 42 cells) shortens the experimental period [122]. In an interlaboratory study of non-genotoxic carcinogens using the Bhas 42 cell transformation assay, there was an overall high interlaboratory variability in focus formation in the negative control and inconsistent results between laboratories [123]. Additionally, these transformation assays have a high rate of false positives and negatives, and do not provide any information on the mode of action of the agent in question, thus, other tests are needed to validate results.

Overall, analysis of the *in vitro* cell transformation assay indicates that SHE > C3H10T1/2 > BALB/c 3T3 cells in relation to sensitivity, specificity, predictivity and validity for the detection of non-genotoxic carcinogens. The SHE transformation assay had the best results but there was a high degree of variation; a problem also found in Bhas 42 cells.

### 6.4. Inhibition of GJICs

The inhibition of GJICs can be measured by using a dye injection and dye transfer method where the number of dye-transferring cells per injection of the dye is considered as an index for intercellular communication [124]. This method may be a better alternative to RDS and *in vitro* cell transformation assays because numerous non-genotoxic carcinogens exhibit the inhibition or reduction of GJICs including chlordane [69], TCDD [70], DDT [24], pentachlorophenol [71], phenobarbital [24], polybrominated biphenyls, sodium saccharin, butylated hydroxyanisol [43], peroxisome proliferators (Wy-14643 and DEHP) [72], acetamide [73], phenytoin, mirex [47], nickel and arsenic compounds [43]. More validation studies in the use of the inhibition of GJICs are needed to address their use for the detection of non-genotoxic carcinogens. Promising results have been obtained [68] but it is evident that other mechanistic tests are needed for mode of action evaluation.

### 6.5. Toxicogenomics

The comparison of gene expression profiles via microarray analysis may provide insights on the mechanisms and pathways altered shortly after exposure to non-genotoxic carcinogens. In a gene expression profiling study by Ellinger-Ziegelbauer [125], rats were dosed with the non-genotoxic hepatocarcinogens methapyrilene (MP), Wy-14643 (Wy), piperonylbutoxide (PB) and diethylstilbestrol (DES). Time-course study showed that the most characteristic responses for each non-genotoxic carcinogen was obtained after 7 days of treatment, while mitogenic responses were detected after days 1 and 3 [125]. The consistent upregulation of apurinic/apurimidic endonuclease APEX1 by all non-genotoxic carcinogens and the compound-specific oxidative stress (upregulation of proteasome and mitochondrial heat shock proteins (HSPs) by PB and Wy, of cytosolic HSPs by all non-genotoxic carcinogens, of antioxidant response element target genes by PB, MP and DES) may lead to indirect base modifications important for cancer initiation. In terms of cancer promotion, non-genotoxic carcinogens had a distinct effect on DNA replication and cell cycle progression. Non-genotoxic carcinogens upregulated genes involved in DNA replication (MCM6, PCNA, TOP2A), in cell cycle progression and entry to mitosis (cyclin B1, CDC2), and spindle formation (tubulins, TUBA1, TUBB5). The different pathways altered by non-genotoxic carcinogens were not surprising given their wide range of modes of action. For this reason, combinations of pathway-associated gene expression profiling may be necessary to identify and characterize putative non-genotoxic carcinogens [125].

Predictive toxicogenomic studies of non-genotoxic carcinogens in rat liver have identified six genes that were differentially expressed in 24 non-genotoxic carcinogens in comparison to 28 non-carcinogens [126]. Three genes were upregulated by non-genotoxic carcinogens: the nuclear transport factor 2, progesterone receptor membrane component 1, and phenobarbital-inducible uridine diphosphate glucuronltransferase. The nuclear transport factor 2 is necessary for the shuttling of molecules from the cytosol into the nucleus; progesterone receptor membrane component 1 is thought to mediate interactions between endogenous steroids, such as progesterone and estrogen, and aryl hydrocarbon receptor agonist; and phenobarbital-inducible uridine diphosphate glucuronltransferase modulates the clearance of thyroxine by glucoronidation and when induced, it decreases thyroid hormone levels in the plasma, and stimulates thyroid stimulating hormone synthesis. Three genes were downregulated by non-genotoxic carcinogens: metallothionein 1A, suppressor of lin-12 homolog, and methionine adenosyltransferase. Metallothionein 1A is an important metalloprotein that protects the cell against heavy metal toxicity; suppressor of lin-12 homolog is involved in cell fate determination; and methionine adenosyltransferase and its gene product S-adenosyl-L-methionine are involved in DNA methylation and silencing of hepatic genes. The six genes were used to screen 123 compounds in a database. These genes were capable of identifying non-genotoxic carcinogens with 88.5% prediction accuracy estimated by cross-validation and 84% accuracy when samples were hybridized to CodeLink oligo-based arrays, including a number of extrahepatic tumor-inducing compounds [126]. Further evaluation of the signature to predict carcinogenicity in extra-hepatic tissues is needed because extra-hepatic tumor-inducing compounds were also detected by Fielden et al. [127].

In a study of rat hepatic gene expression data, a transcriptional signature (a unique gene expression profile) was generated to predict the likelihood of non-genotoxic carcinogens to induce liver cancer. Independent validation of this signature demonstrated 86% sensitivity and 81% specificity [128]. A mechanism-based approach was utilized to obtain this signature and included known hepatocarcinogens that induced cancer via regenerative proliferation, receptor activation, peroxisome proliferation and endocrine disruption [128]. Overall, the test chemicals clustered most closely to the reference chemical with similar known mechanism of action. Inter-laboratory comparison of signatures obtained by Nie et al. [126] and Fielden et al. [128] showed similar accuracy in classification of test chemicals with decreased test sensitivity and specificity [127]. Further inter-laboratory studies are needed to address differences in animal treatment protocols, microarray platforms and stochastic errors [127]. In this regard, recent studies utilizing quantitative PCR (qPCR) have succeeded in validating the signature obtained by Nie et al. [126] after day 1 and day 5 [129] where all non-genotoxic carcinogens were correctly identified. In contrast, the validation of the signature obtained by Fielden et al. [128] only identified 2/3 non-genotoxic carcinogens after day 5, while none were identified after day 1 [129]. It is evident that microarray technologies need harmonization, only provide a snapshot of molecular processes, and need sophisticated statistical methods to refine and discriminate between the multiple pathways involved in carcinogenesis [130,131]. Dose-response and time-course studies in large sets of agents encompassing multiple toxicological endpoints are needed to fill the existing data gaps.

Finally, it is worthwhile mentioning that *in vitro* studies have shown differences in gene expression profiles between DNA reactive and non-DNA reactive mechanisms in L5178Y TK+/− mouse lymphoma cells [131,132] and in the human lymphoblastoid cell line TK6 [133]. Of particular interest is the use of a gene set consisting of genes involved in apoptosis, cell cycle regulation, DNA repair, inflammatory responses, p53 regulation, oxidative DNA damage response, mitochondrial function and stress response to conduct time-course and dose–response studies in human TK6 cells while at the same time assessing inter-laboratory variability [133]. This set of genes was able to reproducibly discriminate between a direct genotoxin (Cisplatin), an aneugen (taxol), a topoisomerase inhibitor (etoposide) and a cytotoxic clastogen (sodium chloride), with optimal gene expression profiles obtained at early time points (after 4 h) [133]. It has been suggested that better methods of phenotypic anchoring of gene expression profiles need to be developed for optimal results [133]. The use

various supervised clustering methods of gene expression profiles from *in vitro* human HepG2 cells are capable of discriminating genotoxic from non-genotoxic carcinogens but it remains uncertain whether non-carcinogens can be correctly predicted [134, 135]. The biological mechanisms of the 27 main classifier genes selected included apoptosis, cell cycle control, transcription regulation activity, nucleic acid binding, porter activity and electrochemical potential-driven transporter activity [135]. The use of *in vitro* approaches for the identification of non-genotoxic carcinogens using microarray technology and/or qPCR needs to be explored.

### 7. Challenges

It is very difficult at this point to propose a scheme that would aid scientists and regulators with hazard identification of non-genotoxic carcinogens given that test strategies that provide MOA information are currently unavailable. In the case of genotoxic carcinogens, a consensus in regards to which genotoxic tests are more predictive of carcinogens is ongoing and recent efforts have been made by the International Programme on Chemical Safety (IPCS) and the World Health Organization (WHO) to provide a harmonized scheme of test strategies for the identification of mutagens and genotoxic carcinogens [136] and similar genotoxic batteries and test strategy is used in Europe by REACH [137]. Although the performance of individual and/or combination of *in vitro* test (Ames, MN, CA and MLA) is not optimal because of the high rate of misleading ‘false’ positives (*i.e.* a positive result obtained from a non-carcinogen) [138, 139], these genotoxic tests at least provide some information about the MOA of the toxicant in question. For instance, the Ames test is a bacterial test for gene mutation, the MN and CA provide information in regards to chromosomal aberrations and the MLA is a mammalian cell mutation assay [136]. Given the strong association between the accumulation of genetic damage and cancer, these tests are in theory, a good surrogate for predicting the carcinogenic potential of toxicants with genotoxicity as a primary MOA. Unfortunately, the same does not apply to non-genotoxic carcinogens because the diversity of MOA, the tissue and species specificity, and the absence of genotoxicity make predicting their carcinogenic potential in short-term tests very challenging.

Ideally, the use of Integrated Testing Strategies (ITS) are needed to conduct hazard and risk assessment on a large number of chemicals where the major tools include grouping chemicals into categories and perform read-across, applying a battery of (Q)SARs, utilizing a weight of evidence approach for risk characterization with available data, and applying any information regarding human exposure levels to make risk assessment judgments [140]. Thus far, the applicability of (Q)SARs by regulatory agencies and pharmaceutical companies to predict the mutagenic potential of new chemicals using computational databases such as DEREK, TOPKAT and MCASE show poor sensitivity for predicting Ames positivity and poorer sensitivity in predicting other genotoxicity endpoints [86]. The primary limitations are presumed to be due to a lack of understanding of the genotoxic mechanisms of non-structurally alerting drugs [86]. From these studies, it can only be predicted that unless we fully understand the MOA of all non-genotoxic carcinogens, the applicability of (Q)SARs for hazard identification is very limited. It is conceivable that (Q)SARs may be utilized when structural alerts for specific groups of chemicals are detected, as in the case of the 3-position H-bonding ability of phenols in 17β-estradiol and xenoestrogens to bind to the estrogen receptor [113]. Other tests such as the RDS, *in vitro* cell transformation assays, and inhibition of GJICs do not provide any information on the MOA, and cannot be used to predict the carcinogenic potential of

toxicants on their own unless additional MOA studies are performed. For tests such as the SHE cell transformation assay which predict both non-genotoxic and genotoxic carcinogens as well as discriminate non-carcinogens from carcinogens with a high degree [120], a lack of selectivity to distinguish between rodent and human carcinogens is observed [141]. In addition, the mechanisms and molecular pathways responsible for the observed transformation in SHE cells remain unknown.

For the time being, the IPCS has developed a conceptual and transparent framework for evaluating MOA for chemical carcinogens which assesses the overall weight of evidence for the postulated MOA [142–144]. This framework is an analytical approach that investigates how a toxicant produces a toxic effect (*i.e.* carcinogenicity) and whether the MOA is relevant to humans. The MOA/human relevance (MOA/HR) framework establishes whether the weight of evidence is sufficient to establish the MOA in animals, describes ‘key events’ in the animal (*i.e.* specific metabolic transformation, inhibition of apoptosis, receptor-ligand modulation, increased cell proliferation, increased organ weight, hormonal perturbations, etc.), and analyzes dose-response relationships and temporal associations of key events and compares them to tumor endpoints [142–144]. Human relevance can be reasonably excluded on the basis of qualitative and/or quantitative physiological differences between animals and humans. The potential of toxicogenomics to identify key events representing various carcinogenic modes of action of non-genotoxic carcinogens such as nuclear receptor-mediated cell signaling, non-nuclear receptor-mediated cell signaling, immune response modulation, inflammation, cytotoxicity and compensatory cell proliferation, mitogenicity, and interference with intercellular communications needs further investigation. Thus, an understanding of the carcinogenic modes of action of as many human non-genotoxic carcinogens is needed in addition to the traditional non-genotoxic carcinogens (TCDD, carbon tetrachloride, cyclosporine) that are routinely studied.

In terms of the MOE approach which is limited to substances that have both animal carcinogenicity data as well as human exposure data, efforts have been made to analyze dose–response microarray data using BMD and gene ontology (GO) classification [145]. This method was applied to gene expression data in the rat epithelium after formaldehyde exposure. First, differentially expressed genes that showed a dose–response were identified, the resulting set of genes were matched to an associated gene ontology category, the average BMD and BMDL was calculated for each category resulting in the identification of doses at which individual cellular processes are altered [145]. Results indicated that the BMD estimates were similar to those obtained from other methods such as cell labeling indices, DNA–protein cross-links, and rat nasal tumors [145]. Promising results are observed with other similar methods such as the ToxResponse Modeler [146] and BMDEpress [147] which estimate BMD values from gene expression data and use GO classification to characterize dose-dependent responses of specific cellular processes. Although future studies are needed to validate the use of BMD values derived from dose–response microarray data, it is conceivable that the lowest BMDL from various cellular processes may be used as a risk assessment parameter in the MOE calculation instead of the LTD₁₀ derived from animal carcinogenicity studies. Importantly, the relationship between the BMDL from dose–response microarray data and the LTD₁₀ derived from dose–response carcinogenicity studies first needs to be explored before its use in a regulatory context.

### 8. Conclusions

Although the expected number of non-genotoxic carcinogens among newly registered compounds is unknown, there is a growing concern that when numbers of 2-year cancer bioassays
are significantly reduced as in the case of REACH, non-genotoxic carcinogens may go undetected. Given the potential hazard associated with them, there is a need for the development of alternative methods for their detection. Structure–activity relationships (SARs) and (Q)SARs, replicative DNA synthesis assay, the *in vitro* cell transformation assay and/or inhibition of GJICs are possible alternative methods for detecting non-genotoxic carcinogens but none provide any information on the mode of action and future studies are needed to address this issue. Finally, of most potential, is the use of toxicogenomics to analyze multiple pathway-specific gene expression profiling of known human non-genotoxic carcinogens for the identification of putative alerts/markers. Validation studies testing sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictivity and validity are also needed to assess their use in identification and characterization of human non-genotoxic carcinogens. Of particular importance is the understanding of the carcinogenic modes of action of as many non-genotoxic carcinogens as possible and steer away from using only the traditional non-genotoxic carcinogens (TCDD, carbon tetrachloride, cyclosporine).

The use of toxicogenomics also offers the most promising results in terms of reliability and reducing the number of animals, time and cost. Additional validation studies of the signatures obtained by Ellinger-Ziegelbauer et al. [125], Nie et al. [126] and Fielden et al. [127] where non-genotoxic carcinogens were identified with high prediction accuracy are needed. Of particular interest, is the detection of extra-hepatic non-genotoxic carcinogens by gene expression profiling and using liver as a surrogate tissue for their identification. The use of toxicogenomics to identify differences in gene expression profiles that can uniquely distinguish and identify non-genotoxic carcinogens is an area that needs validation. In terms of REACH, test strategies need to be developed for the detection non-genotoxic carcinogens among new substances.

## 9. Recommendations

This review has outlined the importance of using a weight of evidence approach when evaluating the carcinogenic potential and mode of action of human non-genotoxic carcinogens. Detection of non-genotoxic carcinogens is difficult because of the diversity of modes of action, the tissue- and species-specificity, and the absence of genotoxicity. More research is needed to improve our understanding on the modes of action of human non-genotoxic carcinogens. Also, alternative methods for the detection of non-genotoxic carcinogens need to be explored especially with the significant reduction in the number of 2-year carcinogenicity bioassays under REACH where the carcinogenic potential of new and existing substances is determined by genotoxic endpoints.

Although our analysis of MOE was not a robust one because of the lack data, it was clear that even from this weak (non-robust) analysis, a possible human hazard is associated with exposure to some non-genotoxic carcinogens. Consequently, (i) for every hazard or risk evaluation of chemicals, the mode of action should always be investigated and (ii) for every compound negative for genotoxicity with (a) putative non-genotoxic mode(s) of action, appropriate risk reduction measures should be mandatory.
