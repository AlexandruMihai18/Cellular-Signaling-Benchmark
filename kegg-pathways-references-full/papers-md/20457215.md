## ABSTRACT

Familial pituitary adenomas occur in the classical syndromes of MEN1 and Carney Complex as well as in Familial Isolated Pituitary Adenomas (FIPA), an autosomal dominant disease with incomplete penetrance. In some families and also rarely in sporadic tumours germline mutations of a gene located on chromosome 11q13 known as the aryl hydrocarbon receptor interacting protein have been found. This article discusses the AIP mutations in these groups and the different molecular interactions of AIP that may play a role in pituitary tumour formation.

## 1. Introduction

Pituitary adenomas occurring within two or more members of the same family, where there is no clinical or genetic evidence suggesting Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia type 1 (MEN 1) or Carney Complex (CNC), can be defined as having Familial Isolated Pituitary Adenoma (FIPA) (Daly et al., 2006). Some of these families have been found to have mutations in the aryl hydrocarbon receptor interacting protein (AIP) gene. The AIP gene is located on the 11q13 and consists of 6 exons and codes for a 330 amino acid protein. The protein is a co-chaperone and thought to be important in keeping proteins and protein complexes in functional formation. The C-terminal end of the protein forms three tetratricopeptide (TPR) repeats which are important for protein–protein interactions (Ma and Whitlock, 1997) (Fig. 1). Heterozygote mutations in this gene predispose to pituitary tumorigenesis but the exact molecular pathways are not clear as AIP is involved with various molecular pathways such as interactions with the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), phosphodiesterases, survivin, G proteins and RET.

## 2. AIP mutations

Approximately 20–40% of FIPA families have been shown to harbour an AIP gene mutation (Cazabat et al., 2007; Chahal et al., 2010; Daly et al., 2007; Georgitsi et al., 2008, 2007). Patients with AIP mutations typically have early-onset disease often in childhood and most of the adenomas associated with AIP mutations release GH and/or prolactin into the circulation or at least stain for these hormones on immunostaining (Cazabat et al., 2009; Igreja et al., 2010). Within these families there is variable penetrance of the disease with around 20–30% in the largest families studied in detail (Igreja et al., 2010; Naves et al., 2007).

The process which led to the identification of the AIP gene has started with the description of families with pituitary adenomas but no other typical clinical features of MEN1. The clinical features of these familial acromegaly families were clearly distinguishable from the MEN1 syndrome: patients had primarily somatotroph adenomas, which only occurs in 25% of MEN1-related pituitary adenomas, no parathyroid or pancreas disease were identified and the penetrance was considerably lower than in MEN1 (Benlian et al., 1995; McCarthy et al., 1990). After the identification of the MEN1 gene the notion of a separate syndrome was supported by the lack of mutations in the *MEN1* gene. Loss of heterozygosity was described at 11q13 locus overlapping the MEN1 gene locus 2 families with familial acromegaly (Benlian et al., 1995; Yamada et al., 1997). Two further families were soon described also showing LOH at this site (Gadelha et al., 1999, 2000). Nine further families have been described with LOH at 11q13 before the gene located at this locus has been identified (Luccio-Camelo et al., 2004; Soares et al., 2005). Using genealogy data reaching back to the 18th century in 2 seemingly unrelated families with 13 affected and 7 obligate carrier subjects were identified and analysed. Combining the data with a population based study with 45 acromegaly patients in Northern Finland identified a common locus at 11q13 consisting of 295 genes. Using gene expression studies in leukocytes AIP was selected as a top candidate. Sequence analysis of the coding region of the AIP gene revealed the Q14X mutation in the large families and some of the seemingly sporadic patients. Interestingly 2 female patients

Fig. 1. Structure of the AIP gene and protein.

Cytosines in CpG dinucleotides can be methylated by DNA methyltransferases by attaching a methyl group to carbon 5 of cytosine, altering its structure without altering its base-pairing properties to form 5-methylcytosine (Fig. 3). While spontaneous deamination of cytosine forms uracil, which is recognized and removed by DNA repair enzyme uracil DNA glycosylase, deamination of 5-methylcytosine forms thymine, and this cannot easily turn back to 5-methylcytosine (Fig. 3). This conversion of a DNA base from cytosine (C) to thymine (T) can result in a transition mutation. It has also been suggested that flanking nucleotides of CpG islands could influence the mutational rate with purine bases (G or A) downstream of the CpG site causing higher mutational rate (Krawczak et al., 1998).

According to the data available today, there are 3 sites of the AIP gene where mutations have been identified in several independent families. The R304, c.910C > T and c.911G > A (mutations identified in Italy, UK, Ireland, France, Romania, Poland) the R271, c.811C > T (Polynesia, 2 families from Europe, Somalia (Korbonits unpublished observation)) and the R81, c.241C > T (USA, Brazil) sites. All these 3 sites are CpG sites. In all three of these hotspots the CpG island is followed by a purine base (for R81 and R304 CGA and for 271 CGG). At the R304 locus both members of the CpG site has been shown to be mutated. The c.910C > T, p.R304X change affects the C nucleotide in the CpG island while the c.911G > A, p.R304Q change affects the G. Typically changes in C of the CpG island are more often recognized as CG < TG transitions being more likely to disrupt protein function than are CG < CA transitions (CGA < TGA transitions create termination codons, whereas no CG < CA transition yields a nonsense mutation).

The penetrance of the disease is low or variable. Data from our largest families suggest that it is between 15% and 30%. Smaller families reveal higher penetrance data but this maybe skewed by the lack of complete genealogical data. The existence of modifier loci for acromegalic phenotypes has also been suggested in a study with a genome wide scan using 400 microsatellites, which helps to provide further insight into the clinical variability seen in familial acromegaly patients (Khoo et al., 2009).

who were part of the family with microprolactinomas did not share the disease-associated haplotype around the 11q13 locus and did not harbour the Q14X mutation, drawing attention to the possibility of phenocopy in this familial disease. Similar phenocopies have been described for MEN1 (Turner et al., 2010). Subsequently, further seemingly sporadic Finnish patients were identified with this mutation but this change was not identified in any other country suggesting that the increased prevalence of this mutation is possibly result of the founder effect and not due to a 'hotspot' mutation.

Forty-nine sequence variants have been identified in the AIP gene by the international cohorts of Finnish, Belgian and British groups in addition to individual family reports from elsewhere (Table 1 and Fig. 2). Many of these results in complete disruption of the C-terminal end of the molecule due to nonsense mutations or splice-site and frameshift changes resulting in stop codons. Pathogenic missense mutations tend to affect the two final TPRs and the C-terminal α-helix, which are responsible for the mediation of protein-protein interactions (Kazlauskas et al., 2002). In addition, more recent studies using the multiplex ligation dependant probe amplification (MLPA) technique have been able to demonstrate large genomic deletions of the AIP gene in patients who have previously screened negative for germline AIP mutations (Georgitsi et al., 2008; Igreja et al., 2010). Altogether 70% of the mutations disrupt the C-terminal end of the AIP molecule. Caution should be taken with missense sequence variants identified in sporadic patients or in families if it does not segregate with the disease as rare polymorphisms could be mislabelled as disease-causing mutation, such as the R16H variant and this could cause unnecessary anxiety and investigations for the patient and the family.

Mutational hotspots are areas of DNA where mutations occur at a higher frequency than the normal mutation rate. Hotspot mutations have usually been identified in independent families or samples. The most commonly mutated locations are methylated CpG sites. CpG sites are regions of DNA where a cytosine nucleotide occurs next to a guanine nucleotide in the linear sequence of bases along the same allele. “CpG” stands for cytosine and guanine separated by a phosphate (—C—phosphate—G—), which links the two nucleosides together on the same strand of the DNA molecule.

3. AIP interactions

It is not clear, however, how lack of AIP leads to tumorigenesis. Here we discuss some of the interactions of AIP which might play a role in this process.

3.1. Effect of dioxin on endocrine function

One of the first known partner of the AIP protein is the orphan nuclear receptor AhR. AhR is known to bind the environmental toxin dioxin (2,3,7,8 tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, TCDD, Fig. 4) but it is not clear whether this link has a role in the pituitary tumorigenesis or not. Following an industrial accident in 1995 in Seveso, Italy, a small population was exposed to TCDD, the incidence of pituitary tumours in those with high, intermediate, low and no exposure was investigated. Although no statistically significant increase in pituitary tumour incidence was found in the affected territory, further follow up in these areas is needed (Pesatori et al., 2008). Dioxin has a toxic effect on several organs including the skin and the liver, and it has also been shown to interact with the endocrine system at several levels.

3.1.1. Reproduction

Dioxin has been shown to accelerate reproductive senescence in female rats following chronic dioxin exposure. Research has shown that human males exposed to TCDD in the work place may have decreased fertility (Egeland et al., 1994; Schrag and Dixon, 1985;

Fig. 3. Mutational hotspots at methylated cytosine (C) residues. If unmethylated C suffers spontaneous deamination it turns to uracil. This alteration can be repaired by the DNA repair enzyme uracil DNA glucosylase. If methylated C (usually part of a CpG site) suffers spontaneous deamination it turns to a thymine, a change which often cannot be repaired.

Sikka and Wang, 2008). A birth cohort study from the industrialized city of Duisburg in Germany found that mothers with higher levels of TCDD in their blood during pregnancy and in maternal milk produced offspring with lower levels of testosterone and oestrogen in cord blood (Cao et al., 2008). In view of these profound effects of dioxin on the reproductive axis it is important to mention the case of a 2y girl who is a carrier of a pathogenic AIP mutation and found to have precocious puberty (Naves et al., 2007).

### 3.1.2. Thyroid function

TCDD is able to block triiodothyronine binding to thyroid hormone receptor in a dose dependant manner (Jung et al., 2007). Dioxin is also able to cause a foamy change in the colloid of some thyroid follicles indicating an acceleration of the biosynthesis of T4 in the thyroid (Nishimura et al., 2002). This is followed by an elevation in TSH levels and may represent the early stages in the progression of thyroid carcinogenesis (Sewall et al., 1995). Studies of the population in Seveso following an industrial accident in 1976 found that babies born between 1994 and 2005 to exposed mothers have increased levels of neonatal blood TSH indicating a long-lasting capability of dioxin to modify neonatal thyroid function (Baccarelli et al., 2008).

### 3.1.3. Adrenal function

Experimentation in rat models has shown that TCDD exposure reduces the bioactivity of ACTH. This effect may be mediated by AhR (Bestervelt et al., 1993, 1998).

### 3.2. AIP interaction with the aryl hydrocarbon receptor

The AhR is a ligand inducible transcription factor (member of the basic-helix-loop-helix (bHLH) PAS (Per-ARNT-Sim) gene superfamily) which regulates dioxin and other environmental toxin metabolizing enzymes (Kazlauskas et al., 2002). When no ligand is bound AhR is associated with the molecular chaperone Hsp90 (heat shock protein 90) (Perdew, 1988), co-chaperone p23 (Kazlauskas et al., 1999) and AIP (Carver and Bradfield, 1997; Ma and Whitlock, 1997) (Fig. 5). Once ligand is bound, AhR accumulates in the cell nucleus where it heterodimerizes with ARNT (AhR nuclear translocator protein) causing transcription of specific genes via binding to dioxin/xenobiotic-inducible response element.

Fig. 5. The AhR-AIP complex exists in the cytoplasm when no ligand is bound. Once the ligand (dioxin) binds to the C-terminal end of AhR the complex migrates into the nucleus. Once in the nucleus AhR-dioxin complex heterodimerizes with ARNT inducing transcription of specific genes.

Fig. 6. It is not clear how AhR activation exerts tumorigenic effects. Although it is known that activation of AhR leads to transcriptional induction of several xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes, such as CYP1A1 (A), no mechanistic link can be established between CYP1A1 induction and tumour production. Activation of JunD (Weiss et al., 2008) (B), inhibition of the proapoptotic effect of E2F1 (Marlowe et al., 2008) (C) and stimulation of p53 degradation (Paajarvi et al., 2005) (D), transportation of PAH into the nucleus causing direct DNA damage (Park et al., 2009) (E) and telomere-independent senescence (Ray and Swanson, 2009) (F) have all been suggested as possible mechanisms in various experimental conditions. In normal cells AhR upregulates AhRR expression and the competing effects of AhR and AhRR on XREs result in a balanced effect on gene expression (G). In cancer cells AhRR promoter XRE is methylated and/or lost resulting in unopposed AhR effect on genes stimulating cell proliferation (H) (Zudaire et al., 2008).

(Kolluri et al., 2001, 1999; Ramadoss and Perdew, 2005). Geldanamycin, a drug which specifically inhibits Hsp90 by binding to its ATP binding pocket, showed inhibition of complex formation between AIP and AhR (Roe et al., 1999).

There is considerable controversy regarding the effect of AIP on AhR (stimulates or inhibits its function, expression (Carver et al., 1998; Kazlauskas et al., 2000, 2002; Petrulis et al., 2003)) and regarding the effect of AhR on cell proliferation (stimulation or inhibition). Variability is due to several factors including: species differences (Hahn, 2002; Ramadoss and Perdew, 2005), tissue-specific effects, presence or absence of ligand (Barhoover et al., 2010) or DNA damage (Marlowe and Puga, 2005). Figs. 6 and 7 summarises the suggested mechanisms.

A unifying explanation to these controversial effects was suggested by Peng et al. In the absence of ligand AHR promotes cell cycle progression and its activation by high-affinity ligands results in interactions with the retinoblastoma protein that lead to perturbation of the cell cycle, G0/G1 arrest, diminished capacity for DNA replication and inhibition of cell proliferation. It is hypothesised that the AhR may function as a tumour suppressor gene that becomes silenced in the process of tumour formation. To investigate this theory, samples of liver tumours from mice with liver-specific RB ablation were compared with WT mice for levels of various tumour suppressor genes, TGFβ genes and the AhR gene. AhR was found to be significantly repressed in tumours from both sets of mice, supporting the concept that AhR silencing may be associated with cancer progression (Peng et al., 2008).

Further evidence from experimentation in human breast cancer cells found that interactions between AhR, CDK4 and cyclinD1 were disrupted with TCDD treatment. The disruption temporally correlated with G1 cell cycle arrest and decreased phosphorylation of RB. The results suggest that the AhR interacts in a complex with CDK4 and cyclinD1 in the absence of exogenous ligands to facilitate cell cycle progression. This interaction is disrupted by exogenous ligands, such as TCDD, to induce G1 cell cycle arrest (Barhoover et al., 2010).

How are the members of this AhR–AIP pathway expressed in human pituitary adenomas? Despite AIP to be restricted to GH and prolactin cells in normal pituitary, in adenomas it is present in all cell types, with somatotrophinomas and NFPA showing highest expression (Jaffrain-Rea et al., 2009; Leontiou et al., 2008). The expression of AhR is proportional to AIP and AIP mutant cases show low level of AhR expression (Jaffrain-Rea et al., 2009). The level of AIP and AhR expression has been suggested to be proportional to the invasiveness of the adenomas. AhR and ARNT are less expressed in AIP mutant adenoma samples (Heliovaara et al., 2009; Jaffrain-Rea et al., 2009). Recently preliminary data suggested that AhRR is overexpressed at the mRNA level in human somatotroph adenomas (Trivellin et al., 2010).

AhR tumour suppressor mechanisms

Fig. 7. AhR inhibits cell proliferation. Two models exist for the effect of AhR-pRB on the cell cycle. Firstly the co-repression model suggests that activation of AhR causes the translocation of Rb to the nucleus where it promotes repression of E2F-dependent transcription and induces cell cycle arrest (Huang and Elferink, 2005; Marlowe et al., 2004; Puga et al., 2000). The other theory of co-activation involves the AhR-pRB interaction participating in transcriptional activation of genes encoding G1 phase regulatory protein p27 (Huang and Elferink, 2005; Kolluri et al., 1999). AhR can directly bind to the XRE element of p21 and p27 and can upregulate these gene expressions in human umbilical vascular endothelial cells and this effect is inhibited by resveratrol (Pang et al., 2008).

3.3. AIP interaction with phosphodiesterases, cAMP and G protein α13

Cyclic adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate (cAMP) functions as an intracellular second messenger in several signalling pathways including GHRH receptor pathway in somatotroph cells. CNC and McCune-Albright Syndrome (MAS) have both been linked to abnormally high cAMP levels that may lead to pituitary adenomas (Horvath and Stratakis, 2008a). Phosphodiesterases (PDE) are enzymes that degrade the phosphodiester bond and inactivate cyclic nucleotides such as cAMP and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). Phosphodiesterases can be classified into 11 families which are coded for by 21 genes. All PDEs contain three functional domains: a conserved catalytic core, a regulatory N-terminus and the C-terminus, with the N-terminus showing great diversity between families. The various PDE families and the isoforms within the respective family have varying substrate preferences for cAMP and cGMP (Halpin, 2008).

The interaction between the AhR pathway and cAMP specific phosphodiesterase isoform PDE4A5 was first noted using a yeast two hybrid assay. It was found that AIP reversibly inhibited the activity of PDE4A5 and increased its sensitivity to rolipram, a PDE4 inhibitor (Bolger et al., 2003). As increased cAMP levels are associated with tumorigenic effect it is currently unclear how AIP could exert a tumour suppressor role via PDE4A5 (de Oliveira and Smolenski, 2009).

Another PDE isoform PDE2A can also bind AIP. Binding of PDE2A to AIP inhibited TCDD- and cAMP-induced nuclear translocation of AhR in Hepa1c1c7 hepatocytes. PDE2A also attenuated TCDD-induced transcription in reporter gene assays. This indicates that AIP targets PDE2A to the AhR complex causing a restriction in AhR mobility via a local reduction in cAMP levels (de Oliveira et al., 2007). PDE2A might also have a chaperone-like effect and participate indirectly, through its interaction with AIP, in the stabilization of AHR in the cytosol, although again the mechanism for this is unclear. However, there is evidence to suggest that TCDD treatment of cells, prevent adipocytes differentiation via TCDD-mediated transcriptional activation of C/EBPbeta. Activation

of the C/EBPbeta promoter is mediated through incomplete cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) sites (Vogel et al., 2004). The protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor H89 completely blocks the TCDD-dependent effect on C/EBPbeta promoter activity, indicating that TCDD activates CREB binding via a cAMP/PKA pathway, which is supported by the increased cAMP level and PKA activity observed after TCDD treatment (Oesch-Bartlomowicz et al., 2005; Vogel et al., 2004). Interestingly two other PDEs, PDE11A4 and PDE8B, has been associated with endocrine neoplasia, specifically adrenocortical hyperplasia but no link to pituitary tumorigenesis has been shown yet (Boikos et al., 2008; Horvath et al., 2006, 2008a,b; Horvath and Stratakis, 2008b; Libe et al., 2008).

The Gα13 is one of the G protein subtypes. It has been shown to destabilise AhR by interacting with AIP, thereby inhibiting the interaction between AhR and AIP. Reporter gene assay and quantitative RT-PCR analysis shows a potent inhibitory effect of Gα13 on the ligand-induced transcriptional activation of AhR (Nakata et al., 2009).

3.4. AIP interaction with survivin and RET

Survivin is a multifunctional member of the IAP (inhibitor of apoptosis) family, but its molecular interactions in mitotic regulation and apoptosis inhibition are not completely understood. In a proteomics screening AIP was found to directly associate with survivin and co-immunoprecipitation experiments supported this finding. The interaction is mediated by the carboxyl-terminal end of AIP, and the carboxyl terminus coiled coil in survivin. It has been found that survivin mutants lacking Asp142 fail to bind AIP and exhibit accelerated degradation in vivo. Knock-down of AIP by siRNA or competition of the survivin-AIP complex by pep-tidyl mimicry destabilizes survivin levels in cells, which enhances apoptosis. This suggests that AIP regulates survivin stability and preserves a cellular anti-apoptotic threshold (Kang and Altieri, 2006). This argue against the tumour suppressor role of AIP but cell type specific effects could explain the discrepancies, as AIP siRNA knockdown increases cell proliferation in GH3 cell line.

### RET is a proto-oncogene encoding a receptor tyrosine kinase for GDNF (glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor) and members of the GDNF family of extracellular signaling molecules. Loss of function mutations in RET are associated with Hirschsprung disease while gain of function mutations lead to MEN2 or medullary thyroid carcinoma syndrome. RET has a long (RET51) and a short (RET9) isoform with 51 or 9 amino acids in their C-terminal tail. RET has a dual role according to the presence or absence of GDNF. In the presence of GDNF, RET promotes cell survival, while in the absence of GDNF RET is able to induce programmed cell death by its C-terminal intracellular proapoptotic fragment which is cleaved by caspase 3. It has been shown that RET is able to stimulate Pit1 and p53 expression and induce apoptosis in somatotroph cells and suggested to restrain somatotroph proliferation ([Canibano et al., 2007](https://doi.org/10.1038/sj.emboj.7601746)). AIP was found to be a novel interactor with RET (both RET9 and RET51) by using a split ubiquitin yeast two-hybrid system ([Vargiolu et al., 2009](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2009.02.086)). The proapoptotic domain of RET was found to facilitate the interaction with AIP, and this interaction prevents the formation of the AIP–survivin complex. It is suggested that AIP directly binds survivin, preventing its degradation thus protecting cells from apoptosis. In the presence of RET, however, AIP is unable to interact with survivin, likely leading to survivin degradation and consequent cell death. So is the interaction with RET important in the tumour suppressor function of AIP? In in vitro studies the tested pathogenic AIP mutations (K241E, R271W and R304Q), do not disrupt the interaction between AIP and RET. Similarly, RET mutations mapping in the region of RET that interact with AIP (E768D, V778I, L790F, V804M, Y806C, S891A, M918T, and S922F) do not disrupt the RET–AIP interaction. Therefore, the relevance of this interaction in pituitary tumorigenesis is uncertain.

#### 3.5. AIP interaction with nuclear receptors

In addition to AhR AIP has been shown to interact of other nuclear receptors such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPAR-α), β-thyroid hormone receptor 1 (TRβ1) and the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). PPAR is a ligand-inducible transcription factor, which mediates the carcinogenic effects of peroxisome proliferators in rodents, whilst in humans PPAR-α plays a fundamental role in regulating energy homeostasis via control of lipid metabolism. PPAR-α has been shown to interact with AIP and Hsp90. Transient expression of AIP co-expressed with PPARalpha resulted in down-regulation of a peroxisome proliferator response element-driven reporter gene activity. This indicated that AIP functions as a PPAR-alpha repressor ([Sumanasekera et al., 2003](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M304883200)).

By using a yeast two-hybrid screening of a mouse hypothalamic complementary DNA library, AIP was found to interact with β-thyroid hormone receptor. Immunohistochemistry showed that AIP and TRβ1 are expressed in the same neurones of the paraventricular nucleus. AIP was found to exert a functional role in modulating the in vivo transcription of TRH, as AIP knockdown by siRNA in mice abolished the TRβ1-mediated activation of TRH transcription. However, it is unclear how this may affect pituitary tumour formation ([Froidevaux et al., 2006](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yexcr.2006.01.013)).

AIP can also bind to the Hsp90-GR complex in mammalian, but not in yeast, cells ([Laenger et al., 2009](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2009.02.086)). The bindings inhibit the nuclear entry of GR resulting in reduced transcriptional activity.

#### 3.6. AIP interaction with viral proteins

AIP was shown to bind to two viral proteins: hepatitis B virus (HBV) X antigen ([Meyer et al., 1998](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.273.29.18283)) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-encoded nuclear antigen-3 (EBNA-3) ([Kashuba et al., 2006](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2006.02.025)). Activation of these peptides can induce transformation of cells suggesting that AIP might play a role in virus induced tumorigenesis.

#### 3.7. AIP interaction with translocase of the outer membrane of mitochondria 20 (TOMM20)

Mitochondrial preproteins are maintained in a loosely folded import-competent conformation by cytosolic chaperones, and are imported into mitochondria by translocator complexes containing a preprotein receptor, termed translocase of the outer membrane of mitochondria (TOMM20). Using two-hybrid screening, AIP was found to interact with TOMM20. In vitro import assays showed that AIP maintains import competency ([Yano et al., 2003](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M304883200)).

### 4. Conclusions

AIP mutations have been reported in several FIPA families demonstrating the role of AIP as a novel gene involved in the development of FIPA. AIP interacts with several protein partners, and currently it is uncertain which of them plays a key role in pituitary tumorigenesis. The AhR–cAMP–PDE pathway seems to be the most likely candidate but further studies are needed to clarify this further.
