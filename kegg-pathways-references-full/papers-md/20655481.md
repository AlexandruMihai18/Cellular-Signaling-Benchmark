# GABA<sub>B</sub> Receptor Coupling to G-proteins and Ion Channels

---

## Abstract

GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors have been found to play a key role in regulating membrane excitability and synaptic transmission in the brain. The GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor is a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) that associates with a subset of G-proteins (pertussis toxin sensitive Gi/o family), that in turn regulate specific ion channels and trigger cAMP cascades. In this review, we describe the relationships between the GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor, its effectors and associated proteins that mediate GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor function within the brain. We discuss a unique feature of the GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor, the requirement for heterodimerization to produce functional receptors, as well as an increasing body of evidence that suggests GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors comprise a macromolecular signaling

heterocomplex, critical for efficient targeting and function of the receptors. Within this complex, GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors associate specifically with Gi/o G-proteins that regulate voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> (Cav) channels, G-protein activated inwardly rectifying K<sup>+</sup> (GIRK) channels, and adenylyl cyclase. Numerous studies have revealed that lipid rafts, scaffold proteins, targeting motifs in the receptor, and regulators of G-protein signaling (RGS) proteins also contribute to the function of GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors and affect cellular processes such as receptor trafficking and activity-dependent desensitization. This complex regulation of GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors in the brain may provide opportunities for new ways to regulate GABA-dependent inhibition in normal and diseased states of the nervous system.

### I. Introduction

GABA is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain that activates two types of receptors; ligand-gated chloride-selective receptors (e.g., GABA<sub>A</sub> and GABA<sub>p</sub>) and metabotropic G-protein coupled GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors. Activation of both receptors triggers inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) that are fast (GABA<sub>A</sub>-mediated) and slow (GABA<sub>B</sub>-mediated), resulting in reduced neuronal excitability. Over the past 30 years, the role of the GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor has been explored in detail and this chapter focuses on the relationship of the GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor with G-proteins, ion channels, and enzymes — the functional effectors that mediate the GABA<sub>B</sub> response within the cell. This review also describes the significance of these relationships in the context of putative GABA<sub>B</sub>-containing signaling complexes and functional regulation within the brain.

First identified by Bowery & Hudson (1979) as an anomalous, bicuculline-insensitive GABAergic current, the GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor is now better understood due to the development of a pharmacologically distinct set of agonists (e.g., baclofen) (Bowery et al., 1979) and antagonists (Bowery, 1993). The GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor is a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) that associates with a subset of pertussis toxin sensitive G-proteins (Gi/o family). Activation of the receptor triggers GTP-dependent release of G-protein heterotrimers (Gα-GTP and Gβγ) which, in turn, regulate specific ion channels and trigger other secondary messenger cascades that affect neuronal excitability (Bormann, 1988). The GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor was first identified in the periphery (Bowery & Hudson, 1979) but has since been shown to also function throughout the CNS. GABA<sub>B</sub> currents have been identified in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) (Diverse-Pierluissi et al., 1999; Dunlap & Fischbach, 1981), hippocampus (Andrade et al., 1986; Charles et al., 2001; Chen & Lambert, 2000; Davies et al., 1991; Fairfax et al., 2004; Gassmann et al., 2004; Kulik et al., 2003; Leaney, 2003; Otis et al., 1993; Otmakhova & Lisman, 2004; Premkumar & Gage, 1994; Ramirez et al.,
2009; Schuler et al., 2001; Sohn et al., 2007; Tiao et al., 2008; Toselli & Taglietti, 1993; Tosetti et al., 2003, 2004; Vidal et al., 2007; Vigot et al., 2006), midbrain (Cardozo & Bean, 1995; Federici et al., 2009; O’Callaghan et al., 1996; Rohrbacher et al., 1997), cerebellum (Becher et al., 2001; Billinton et al., 1999; Fernandez-Alacid et al., 2009; Huston et al., 1995; Slesinger et al., 1997; Turgeon & Albin, 1993), suprachiasmatic nucleus (SON) (Li & Stern, 2004), laterodorsal tegmental area (Chieng & Christie, 1995), ventral tegmental area (VTA) (Cruz et al., 2004), suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) (Chen & van den Pol, 1998), and thalamocortical cells (Crunelli & Leresche, 1991), suggesting that their activation and regulation may underlie a range of actions in normal and diseased states of the nervous system.

## II. GABA<sub>B</sub> Receptor Structure

In the mid-1990s, cloning of the GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor led to the identification of two GABA<sub>B</sub> gene products, GABA<sub>B1</sub> and GABA<sub>B2</sub>, also referred to as GABA R1 (Kaupmann et al., 1997) and R2 (Jones et al., 1998; Kaupmann et al., 1998; Kuner et al., 1999; White et al., 1998), that together form a functional GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor. Interestingly, there was much speculation prior to the cloning on the number of GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor subunits due to the pharmacological and functional profile of the receptors (see below). At first, the two subunits seemed inadequate to address the diverse roles of the receptor. However, two splice variants of the GABA<sub>B1</sub> subunit (1a and 1b) were identified that differ in the N-terminal domain (Kaupmann et al., 1997), the GABA<sub>B1a</sub> subunit containing two protein interacting “sushi” domains (Fig. 1). It has since become apparent that GABA<sub>B</sub> functional diversity arises from a complex control of expression and function (see heterodimerization below) and not from a plethora of subunit isoforms.

The GABA<sub>B1</sub> and GABA<sub>B2</sub> subunits share 35% sequence homology and both resemble a classical GPCR subunit containing an extracellular N-terminal domain, seven-transmembrane domains, and a C-terminal intracellular domain. Functional characterization revealed a remarkable property of GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors—the GABA<sub>B1</sub>/GABA<sub>B2</sub> subunits must be coexpressed to form a functional GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor; when expressed individually, the subunits failed to form physiologically normal receptors (Couve et al., 1998; Jones et al., 1998; Kaupmann et al., 1998; Kuner et al., 1999). It has since been discovered that the GABA<sub>B1</sub> subunit contains an ER retention signal, (RXR(R)), which prevents forward trafficking of the receptor (Margeta-Mitrovic et al., 2000). Dimerization with the GABA<sub>B2</sub> subunit shields the ER retention signal and permits surface expression of both GABA<sub>B1</sub> and GABA<sub>B2</sub> (Calver et al., 2001; Margeta-Mitrovic et al., 2000). Yeast two-hybrid analysis also revealed that the C-terminus of both the GABA<sub>B1</sub> and GABA<sub>B2</sub> subunits were critical for heterodimerization

FIGURE 1 GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor structure. The functional GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor is a heterodimer formed by a GABA B1 and B2 subunit. Each of the subunits possesses extracellular N-termini, seven-transmembrane domains, and intracellular C-termini. The functional receptors heterodimerize via a C-terminal coiled-coil domain that shields an ER retention motif on B1, promoting cell surface expression. Two splice variants of the B1 subunit (1A and 1B) exist, differing by the presence of two “sushi” axonal targeting domains in the 1a subunit. Activation of the receptor occurs when ligand (GABA or baclofen) binds to the N-termini of the B1 subunit in a venus flytrap mode of ligand binding (zoom panel). Essential ligand-binding amino acids have been highlighted. The B2 subunit then confers functional activity coupling to Gi/o G-proteins via its intracellular loops.

(White et al., 1998) and CD spectroscopic analysis of a 30 amino acid sequence in these C-termini revealed a coiled-coil domain between the GABA<sub>B1</sub> and GABA<sub>B2</sub> subunits required for the subunit-specific formation of the receptor (Kammerer et al., 1999) (Fig. 1). Interestingly, the GABA<sub>B2</sub> subunit C-terminus also regulates lateral diffusion in hippocampal neurons suggesting that it helps control receptor expression levels at the plasma membrane (Pooler & McIlhinney, 2007).

The extracellular N-terminal domain of the GABA<sub>B1</sub> subunit is important for ligand binding. Creating a series of GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor chimeras and truncations revealed that the GABA<sub>B1</sub> N-terminus was sufficient to confer wildtype-like ligand binding pharmacology (Malitschek et al., 1999). Later, attempts to determine the minimal functional ligand binding region found that, in fact, most of the N-terminal domain contributes to ligand binding (Deriu et al., 2005). Based on sequence homology and site-directed mutagenesis, it has been proposed that GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors contain a “venus

flytrap" model for ligand binding (Galvez et al., 1999). In the venus flytrap model, the initial step in receptor activation by agonist induces the closure of two ligand binding lobes (lobes I and II; Fig. 1). In the GABA<sub>B1</sub> subunit, hydrogen bonds and salt bridges form between lobe I and GABA and a critical tyrosine in lobe II (Galvez et al., 2000). The tyrosine residue is so critical that baclofen can be converted from an agonist to an antagonist by mutation of the tyrosine to an alanine (Galvez et al., 2000); this finding also supports the conclusion that both agonists and antagonists bind to this region of the receptor.

Though the GABA<sub>B1</sub> subunit binds agonist, both GABA<sub>B1</sub> and GABA<sub>B2</sub> N-terminal domains are required for effective receptor function. As expected, heterodimeric receptors that are mutated to contain two GABA<sub>B2</sub> N-termini are unable to bind GABA (Margeta-Mitrovic et al., 2001b). However, heterodimeric receptors containing two GABA<sub>B1</sub> N-termini do not display wild-type signaling; agonists inhibit instead of activating downstream effectors (Margeta-Mitrovic et al., 2001b). Interestingly, swapping the N-termini (GABA<sub>B1</sub> N-termini attached to GABA<sub>B2</sub> transmembrane/C-termini and vice versa) resulted in receptors indistinguishable from wildtype. The presence of the GABA<sub>B2</sub> N-terminus has also been shown to increase ligand affinity of the GABA<sub>B1</sub> subunit (Galvez et al., 2001). Thus, it is becoming evident that both GABA<sub>B1</sub> and GABA<sub>B2</sub> N-termini are critical for effective ligand activation of GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors.

Ligand binding to the extracellular N-terminal domain leads to activation of G-proteins on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. Previous studies with other GPCRs had implicated the intracellular loops in coupling to G-proteins (Arora et al., 1995; Cypess et al., 1999; Moro et al., 1993). The molecular determinants required for G-protein signaling in the GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor were first identified by a series of chimeric studies. The heptahelical domain (seven-transmembrane domains, intracellular loops, and C-terminus) of the GABA<sub>B2</sub> subunit conferred the receptors G-protein sensitivity (Galvez et al., 2001). More refined replacements indicated that exchange of any of the three intracellular loops of GABA<sub>B2</sub> with their GABA<sub>B1</sub> counterparts resulted in nonfunctional receptors narrowing the G-protein associations to the intracellular loops of GABA<sub>B2</sub> (Margeta-Mitrovic et al., 2001a). Further, point mutations within the second and third intracellular loops of GABA<sub>B2</sub> decreased or completely disrupted G-protein activation (Duthey et al., 2002; Havlickova et al., 2002). Thus, a working model for GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor activation is that the GABA<sub>B1</sub> subunit responds to ligands while the GABA<sub>B2</sub> subunit couples to G-proteins via the intracellular loops (Fig. 1).

The development of subunit-specific GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor knockout mice has revealed a complex role for GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor subunits in the brain. GABA<sub>B1</sub> knockout mice do not exhibit detectable GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor agonist biochemistry or electrophysiology (Prosser et al., 2001; Schuler et al., 2001;

Quéva et al., 2003), consistent with the loss of GABA<sub>B1</sub> ligand binding site. Interestingly, atypical GABA<sub>B</sub> electrophysiological responses can be detected in the hippocampus of GABA<sub>B2</sub> knockout mouse (Gassmann et al., 2004). This study suggests the GABA<sub>B1</sub> subunit either functions independently in these neurons (unlikely due to the ER retention sequence) or is capable of forming functional relationships with other GABA<sub>B2</sub>-like subunits. This is supported by data measuring GABA<sub>B1</sub> RNA and protein in peripheral tissue in the absence of the GABA<sub>B2</sub> subunit despite measurable GABA<sub>B</sub> function within these tissues (Calver et al., 2000). Similarly, it has been shown that the GABA<sub>B2</sub> subunits are capable of forming functional relationships with other GPCR subunits such as the M<sub>2</sub> muscarinic receptor (Boyer et al., 2009), suggesting that alternate GABA<sub>B</sub>–GPCR heterodimer relationships are possible. Moreover, both GABA<sub>B1</sub> and GABA<sub>B2</sub> were shown to independently interact with other receptors such as the extracellular calcium sensing receptor (ECaR), leading to increased surface expression of the receptor (Chang et al., 2007). Future research may prove that GABA<sub>B1</sub> and GABA<sub>B2</sub> promiscuity increases signaling opportunities and potential pathway crosstalk.

### III. GABA<sub>B</sub> Receptor Protein Expression

GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors have been identified within both the peripheral (Lehmann, 2009; Meza, 1998; Ong et al., 1990) and central nervous systems. Some of the highest regions of GABA<sub>B1</sub> and GABA<sub>B2</sub> expression within the CNS include the neocortex, hippocampus, thalamus, and cerebellum. Notably, the GABA<sub>B2</sub> subunit is found in brain regions lacking the GABA<sub>B1</sub> subunit (Charles et al., 2001). These findings suggest that functional GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors are found in many regions of the brain.

At the light microscopy level, GABA<sub>B1</sub> and GABA<sub>B2</sub> subunits were found to overlap in the dendrites of the hippocampus (Kulik et al., 2003) and high-resolution immunocytochemistry revealed a predominance of GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors within spines and shafts of dendrites in hippocampal pyramidal neurons, shown to correspond to the location of excitatory (glutamatergic) synapses (Kulik et al., 2006) and inhibitory (GABAergic) terminals (Kulik et al., 2003). Similarly, electron microscopic studies have localized GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors with their effectors to glutamatergic synapses in Purkinje cells of the cerebellum (Fernandez-Alacid et al., 2009). Recent studies have combined live fluorescence microscopy, biochemistry, and quantitative colocalization to show that GABA<sub>B1</sub> and GABA<sub>B2</sub> subunits have very different mobility properties within hippocampal neurons; GABA<sub>B1</sub> and GABA<sub>B2</sub> subunits heterodimerize primarily at the plasma membrane rather than pre-assembling in the Golgi for vesicular transport (Ramirez et al., 2009). Excitingly, this finding raises the possibility that assembly of functional
GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors at the plasma membrane is a highly dynamic process that may be regulated by intracellular and extracellular cues. However, the GABA<sub>B1</sub> subunit has been shown to redistribute from the distal axons to the soma of hippocampal neurons in the GABA<sub>B2</sub> knockout mouse suggesting an earlier relationship between GABA<sub>B2</sub> and GABA<sub>B1</sub> that targets/maintains GABA<sub>B1</sub> subunit presence in the distal terminals (Gassmann et al., 2004). Further research is needed to fully understand the requirements of heterodimerization and subcellular targeting.

Electron microscopy studies have found the GABA<sub>B1</sub> and GABA<sub>B2</sub> subunits expressed pre- and postsynaptically (Kulik et al., 2003), and electrophysiological studies have corroborated their functional presence at presynaptic (Chen & van den Pol, 1998; Iyadomi et al., 2000; Li et al., 2002; Santos et al., 1995; Takahashi et al., 1998; Wu & Saggau, 1995) and postsynaptic sites (Deisz et al., 1997; Harayama et al., 1998; Li & Stern, 2004). Interestingly, the two isoforms of the GABA<sub>B1</sub> subunit (1a and 1b) have unique expression patterns; *in situ* hybridization studies revealed GABA<sub>B1a</sub> mRNA expression predominantly in the granule cell parallel fiber terminals of the cerebellum (considered presynaptic) while GABA<sub>B1b</sub> was found predominantly in Purkinje cells (considered postsynaptic) (Billinton et al., 1999). Using a combined genetic, physiological, and morphological approach, the GABA<sub>B1a</sub> subunits have since been shown to assemble with GABA<sub>B2</sub> presynaptically to inhibit glutamate release in the hippocampus. Conversely, the GABA<sub>B1b/B2</sub> subunits predominantly mediate postsynaptic inhibition (Perez-Garcia et al., 2006; Vigot et al., 2006). Further, transfected GABA<sub>B1a</sub> subunits localize to the distal axons of the CA3 neurons suggesting that the protein interacting “sushi” motifs that are unique to the N-terminus of the GABA<sub>B1a</sub> subunit promote subcellular localization of the receptor, perhaps by association with unknown partner proteins (see heterocomplex formation section).

## IV. GABA<sub>B</sub> Receptor Effectors

### A. G-proteins

Ligand binding to the GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor triggers GDP/GTP exchange at the Gα subunit of the heterotrimeric (α, β, and γ) G-proteins, resulting in dissociation of the Gα-GTP from the Gβγ dimer. In turn, these G-proteins trigger activation of downstream effectors, including ion channels and enzymes (see below; Fig. 2). The downstream activity is terminated by the intrinsic GTPase activity of the Gα subunit, which hydrolyzes GTP to GDP, and promotes reassociation of the G-protein with the GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor. This GTPase activity has been quantified in postmortem brain tissue, where pharmacological activation of GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors is accompanied by GTPase

FIGURE 2 The primary GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor effectors. Activation of the G-protein coupled GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor stimulates GTP-dependent G-protein (Gi/o) dissociation of the Gα and Gβγ dimer. The Gαi/o subunit has been shown to inhibit adenyl cyclase while the Gβγ dimer is capable of modulating voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> (Ca<sub>V</sub>) or G protein-gated inwardly rectifying K<sup>+</sup> (GIRK) channels, resulting in potent neuronal inhibition. Effector specificity may be regulated by heterocomplex formation, guided by targeting protein partners and subcellular localization.

activity (Odagaki et al., 1998), and in studies that use hydrolysis-resistant analogs of GDP and GTP, GDPβS and GTPγS, respectively, to irreversibly promote GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor effects (Dolphin & Scott, 1987). Using G-protein anti-sera and toxins, it has been shown that the GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor selectively activates a subset of heterotrimeric G-proteins that are pertussis toxin (PTX) sensitive, the Gαi and Gαo family (Menon-Johansson et al., 1993). Interestingly Gαo and Gαi1, but not Gαi2, increased GABA binding to NEM-treated brain membranes suggesting these G-proteins’ specific involvement in GABA<sub>B</sub> function (Morishita et al., 1990). However, functional coupling of GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors with K<sup>+</sup> channels appears to involve a different subset of G-proteins, Gαo and Gαi2 (Leaney & Tinker, 2000). Interestingly, only the Gi subtype has been isolated from the bovine cerebral cortex and couples the GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor to adenyl cyclase (Nishikawa et al., 1997). Increasingly, evidence suggests that the specificity of the G-protein subtype is region- and/or function-specific.

### B. Voltage-Gated Calcium Channels

One of the first confirmed ion channel effectors of the GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor was the voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> (Ca<sub>V</sub>) channel in the early 1980s; calcium-dependent action potentials of the DRG were impaired by GABA treatment (Dunlap & Fischbach, 1981). This was later confirmed by voltage clamp analysis that revealed two calcium currents: transient and sustained (Robertson & Taylor, 1986). Baclofen reduced the peak amplitude of the sustained current. These findings suggested the GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor might mediate inhibitory effects within neurons via the Ca<sub>V</sub> channel. Six types of Ca<sub>V</sub> channel,

made up of multiple and various subunits, have been classified by pharmacology and electrophysiology (Catterall, 2000). The Caᵥ channels are termed L-, T-, N-, P-, Q-, and R-type. The T-type Caᵥ channels are low-voltage-activated, predominantly performing a pacemaker role; the other subtypes are high-voltage-activated. The GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor has been shown to couple specifically to the high-voltage-activated P-, Q-, and N- but not L- or R-type Caᵥ channels (Guyon & Leresche, 1995; Harayama et al., 1998; Huston et al., 1995; Li & Stern, 2004; Mintz & Bean, 1993; Vigot et al., 2006).

The electrophysiological relationship of GABA<sub>B</sub>-Caᵥ has been extensively studied throughout the brain including the hippocampus (Doze et al., 1995; Wu & Saggau, 1995), SON (Li & Stern, 2004), DRG (Menon-Johansson et al., 1993), and midbrain (Cardozo & Bean, 1995). Agonist activation of GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors stimulates Gi/o proteins (Menon-Johansson et al., 1993; Obrietan & van den Pol, 1999) releasing Gβγ to bind to, and inhibit, the high voltage-activated Caᵥ channel (Dolphin, 2003) by 10–50 % (Guyon & Leresche, 1995; Huston et al., 1990; Menon-Johansson et al., 1993). This current inhibition is voltage-independent (Deisz & Lux, 1985) and is driven by a slowing of the Caᵥ channel activation kinetics; as a result calcium influx is reduced, thereby decreasing various calcium-dependent, excitatory neuronal activities. For example, presynaptically, GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor-dependent inhibition of Caᵥ currents leads to reduced neurotransmitter release. In cerebellar granule neurons, application of baclofen inhibits the amplitude of Caᵥ currents by 30–50%, inhibiting glutamate release by 25–30% (Huston et al., 1990). Presynaptic GABA<sub>B</sub>-inhibited Caᵥ currents have also been found at GABA synapses (Chen & van den Pol, 1998; Doze et al., 1995) where the receptor acts as an autoreceptor. In the SCN, for example, evoked IPSCs can be completely ablated by baclofen administration, resulting from presynaptic inhibition of GABA release through inhibition of Caᵥ (Chen & van den Pol, 1998). Similarly depolarization-induced GABA release in CA1 of the hippocampus is reduced by presynaptic GABA<sub>B</sub> autoreceptors that inhibit Caᵥ currents (Doze et al., 1995). High-frequency stimulation promotes long-term potentiation (LTP) in CA1 by depressing GABA release (Davies et al., 1991) and therefore implicates the GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor in synaptic plasticity.

Postsynaptically, the GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor modulation of Caᵥ currents can also regulate neuronal excitability. In the SON, GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor-dependent inhibition of Caᵥ currents (10–25%) (Harayama et al., 1998) reduced firing capabilities due to diminished depolarizations (Li & Stern, 2004). Interestingly, this neuronal regulation was more predominant in vasopressin neurons (as opposed to the oxytocin neurons) suggesting cell-type-specific regulation.

Taken together these studies demonstrate the integral and diverse role GABA<sub>B</sub> modulation of Caᵥ currents plays both pre- and postsynaptically to affect neuronal excitability and synaptic plasticity.

C. Potassium Channels

GABA<sub>B</sub>-induced K<sup>+</sup> currents were identified in 1985 in hippocampal slices (Gähwiler & Brown, 1985; Inoue et al., 1985a, 1985b). The currents responded to changes in extracellular K<sup>+</sup> and were blocked by either barium or caesium, suggesting inwardly rectifying K<sup>+</sup>-selective channels. Unlike other regions of the brain in which Ca<sup>2+</sup> was shown to be the primary ionic conductance controlled by baclofen, the GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor was shown to also be K<sup>+</sup>-linked in the hippocampus. It has since been shown that the GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor couples to a specific type of K<sup>+</sup> channel—the G-protein-gated inwardly rectifying K<sup>+</sup> (GIRK or Kir3) channel (Misgeld et al., 1995). GIRK channels assemble in a cell-specific, homo- or heterotetrameric manner (made up of four different subunits, GIRK1-4) and despite some controversy over the Gα or Gβγ subunits in the 1980s, it is now accepted that the Gβγ dimer binds directly to and opens GIRK channels (Reuveny et al., 1994; Wickman et al., 1994). GIRK channel activation by a Gi/o-coupled GPCR results in hyperpolarization of the neuron, inhibiting neuronal activity (Dascal, 1997). In this way, similar to the GABA<sub>B</sub>-Ca<sub>V</sub> currents, the GABA<sub>B</sub>-GIRK currents are considered inhibitory.

Similar to GABA<sub>B</sub> expression patterns, the GABA<sub>B</sub>-GIRK currents have now been identified in many brain regions, including the hippocampus (Gähwiler & Brown, 1985; Premkumar & Gage, 1994; Kulik et al., 2006), locus coeruleus (Osmanovic & Shefner, 1988), substantia nigra (Lacey et al., 1988; Watts et al., 1996), VTA (Cruz et al., 2004; Labouèbe et al., 2007), cerebellum (Slesinger et al., 1997), thalamus (Wallenstein, 1994), and paraventricular nucleus and SON (Slugg et al., 2003). Activation of the GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor increases membrane conductance and reduces neuronal excitability by direct activation of the GIRK channel (Misgeld et al., 1995; Watts et al., 1996). Critically, loss of GIRK channels leads to uncontrollable neuronal activity; GIRK2 knockout mice display increased susceptibility to seizures and are hyperactive (Signorini et al., 1997; Blednov et al., 2001). The significance of the inhibitory role of the GABA<sub>B</sub>-GIRKs is further highlighted by recent research within the VTA. Blocking the GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor or the GIRK channel within the VTA prevents GABA<sub>A</sub>-mediated IPSC auto-inhibition of DA neurons (Michaeli & Yaka, 2010). These results suggest that presynaptically localized GABA<sub>B</sub>-GIRK currents modulate DAergic output from the VTA. The sensitivity of postsynaptic GABA<sub>B</sub>-GIRK currents within the VTA has been described further (Cruz et al., 2004; Labouèbe et al., 2007); in the VTA, the GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor coupling efficiency (EC<sub>50</sub>) with GIRK channels is an order of magnitude higher in DA neurons, compared to GABA neurons (Cruz et al., 2004). Due to the arrangement of GABA neurons impinging on DA neurons in the VTA, and the difference in coupling efficiency, low concentrations of baclofen (or endogenous GABA) will inhibit GABA neurons via GABA<sub>B</sub>-GIRK, thereby increasing VTA

activity, while higher concentrations will directly activate GABA<sub>B</sub>-GIRKs on the DA neurons to inhibit VTA output (Cruz et al., 2004). Differing expression patterns of GIRK channel subunits in each of the cell types account for this difference in coupling efficiency, enabling bi-directional effects of baclofen/GABA underlying the critical relationship between GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor and effector (Cruz et al., 2004). Recently, the expression of a regulator of G-protein signaling (RGS) 2 protein was shown to further influence the efficacy of GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor signaling in DA neurons (Labouèbe et al., 2007) (see heterocomplex formation and functional regulation sections below). These studies begin to suggest that the role of the GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor is far more complex and subtle than just inhibiting action potential propagation.

## D. Enzymes

GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor activation of enzymes offers another pathway for modulation of neuronal excitability. GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors regulate adenylyl cyclase, an enzyme that converts ATP to the second messenger cAMP, through activated Gαi G-proteins (Nishikawa et al., 1997). The Gαi coupled to the GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor inhibits adenylyl cyclase (Federman et al., 1992), reducing cAMP levels and kinase activity within the cell. Paradoxically, however, evidence suggests that under some circumstances GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors are also capable of assisting in the activation of adenylyl cyclase via the Gβγ dimer (Robichon et al., 2004). Adenylyl cyclase is stimulated by Gαs proteins to increase cAMP levels and promote downstream kinase activity. Research suggests that Gβγ from the GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor is capable of increasing adenylyl cyclase affinity for Gαs from the β-adrenergic receptor (while the Gαi from GABA<sub>B</sub> is sequestered by RGS proteins) resulting in a synergistic acceleration of adenylyl cyclase activity (Robichon et al., 2004). Propagation of adenylyl cyclase activity by the GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor results in cAMP surges that activate protein kinase A (PKA). PKA is capable of altering cellular processes through phosphorylation and has been shown to modify both ion channel function directly and further downstream enzymes and proteins. cAMP surges also regulate cAMP response element binding (CREB) protein, a transcription factor known to regulate CRE-element-containing genes such as tyrosine hydroxylase and neuropeptides (Mayr & Montminy, 2001)—key elements in synaptic signaling. Moreover, in cerebellar neurons, GABA<sub>B</sub> activation promotes Ras activity to induce ERK(1/2) phosphorylation, activation of which triggers a kinase cascade leading to CREB activation (Tu et al., 2007).

Taken together, it appears that GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor is capable of mediating long-term effects within the central nervous system beyond “slow” adaptations to neuronal excitability via the slow IPSC. GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors can modify protein expression and function by phosphorylation and even alter transcription patterns via CREB. Increasingly, there is also evidence that the

GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor is capable of promoting both inhibitory and, in partnership with Gs-coupled GPCRs, stimulatory intracellular pathways. This is an interesting aspect to GABA<sub>B</sub> function within the brain that will need to be explored in more detail over the coming years.

### E. G-Protein Independent Activation

The β-arrestins are small proteins that sterically disrupt GPCR coupling to G-proteins but more recently have also been shown to regulate phosphorylated GPCR expression (Shenoy & Lefkowitz, 2005). They are critical to cellular function contributing to responses such as chemotaxis and cell survival. In sensory chick neurons, β-arrestin has been shown to associate with Ca<sub>V</sub> channels and, upon agonist activation, the GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor is recruited to the β-arrestin-channel and internalized as a complex (Puckerin et al., 2006). In this way fast, β-arrestin-mediated internalization of GABA<sub>B</sub> may contribute to neuronal excitability in a G-protein-independent manner. However, others have found that GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors are stable at the neuronal cell surface, showing little endocytic internalization correlating with a lack of agonist-induced receptor phosphorylation and arrestin recruitment in heterologous expression systems (Fairfax et al., 2004). Interestingly, it appears that cAMP-dependent kinases may phosphorylate the GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor to promote cell surface stability. The apparent paradoxical stabilizing/destabilizing effects of GABA<sub>B</sub> phosphorylation may prove yet another complexity of GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor regulation and signaling.

Recent evidence also suggests that GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors may be capable of G-protein-independent activation by receptor crosstalk. In cerebellar Purkinje cells, for example, the GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor acts as a Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor and modulates metabotropic glutamatergic activity by proposed association and co-factor-like activation of mGluR1 (Tabata et al., 2004). However, whether this is truly attributed to G-protein-independent signaling or GABA<sub>B1</sub> subunit heterodimerization with mGluR1 remains to be determined (see heterodimerization above).

### V. Formation of a Macromolecular Signaling Heterocomplex

Recent studies suggest that small heterocomplexes can be generated to control the trafficking of the receptor to subcellular targets. For example, a pair of “sushi” repeats that distinguish the N-terminus of the GABA<sub>B1a</sub> and the GABA<sub>B1b</sub> subunit appear to promote subcellular localization (Vigot et al., 2006). The GABA<sub>B1a</sub> subunits form heterodimers with GABA<sub>B2</sub> to inhibit glutamate release in the hippocampus while the GABA<sub>B1b</sub> subunits form heteroreceptors postsynaptically to mediate inhibition. In fact, the sushi motifs

are capable of redirecting the GABA<sub>B1a</sub>-containing receptors away from the default dendrite targeting to the axons (Biermann et al., 2010; Vigot et al., 2006). Similarly, when the sushi domains are fused to membrane-associated protein CD8α, its normally uniform expression is redirected almost exclusively to the axons suggesting the motifs function by interacting with axonally bound proteins along intracellular sorting pathways (Biermann et al., 2010; Tiao et al., 2008). The identity of these axonal proteins have yet to be determined but their recruitment to a putative receptor complex may aid targeting.

An interaction with specific cytoskeletal proteins or lipid domains could explain the crossover or separation of signaling pathways. Recent studies have identified some of these scaffold proteins that associate with GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors. Both Marlin 1 (a microtubule binding G-protein) and kinesin-I (a molecular motor) interact with the GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor and are proposed to link the receptor with the tubulin cytoskeleton of neurons, presumably to promote localization and cellular movement (Couve et al., 2004; Vidal et al., 2007). The GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor has also been reported to associate with 14-3-3 proteins (specifically eta and zeta) (Couve et al., 2001). The 14-3-3 proteins often mediate signal transduction suggesting their association with the GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor may contribute to signaling by association with additional binding partners. Similarly the GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor can localize within the plasma membrane by associating with lipid rafts (Becher et al., 2001). Enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids, the lipid rafts contain specific populations of membrane proteins and are capable of changing their size and composition in response to cellular cues (Lingwood et al., 2009). Association of the GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor with the lipid raft microdomain could be one mechanism assisting the formation of a heterocomplex on the plasma membrane.

Recent studies suggest the GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors may form higher order oligomers (Maurel et al., 2008); using spectroscopic techniques, multiple GABA<sub>B1</sub> subunits have been shown to be proximal to one another in both heterologous COS-7 cells and the brain suggesting the formation of GABA<sub>B</sub> oligomers. Further, these oligomers have been shown to exhibit decreased G-protein coupling efficiency (Maurel et al., 2008). Taken together the GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor complexes appear capable of functionally regulating receptor efficacy making their formation potentially critical to cellular function. Further investigation is warranted to fully understand the role of these higher order oligomers *in vivo*.

There is also an increasing body of evidence that suggests the heteromeric GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors form a larger macromolecular signaling complex with G-proteins, scaffold proteins, and effectors to facilitate region- and subcellular-specific regulation of GABA<sub>B</sub> activity (Fig. 2). The time-course/ kinetics of GIRK channel activation would suggest the receptor, G-proteins, and channels reside within the immediate vicinity of each other (Hille, 2001). In support of this, microscopic and spectroscopic techniques have indicated that some effectors are in close proximity to the GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor.

For example, high-resolution immuno-electronmicroscopy shows GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors and GIRK channels colocalize on the same dendritic spines of pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus (Kulik et al., 2006). Interestingly, the GIRK channels and GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors are largely segregated in the dendritic shafts, suggesting at least two types of targeting in these neurons. The effectors may also be involved in recruiting stabilizing protein elements into a complex. For example, various PDZ proteins, known to promote subcellular localization, have been shown to interact with GIRK channels (e.g., SNX27 (Lunn et al., 2007) and PSD-95 (Inanobe et al., 1999)), and association of signaling components (e.g., Src kinase, Ras pathway members) has been reported for the Ca<sub>V</sub> channel (Richman et al., 2004). Finally, RGS proteins have been shown to functionally regulate GABA<sub>B</sub>-effector efficacy in a cue-dependent manner suggesting their local, cell-specific recruitment (Brown & Sihra, 2008; Fowler et al., 2007; Labouèbe et al., 2007; Lomazzi et al., 2008; Mutneja et al., 2005).

Direct evidence for the formation of a quaternary complex made up from GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor, G-protein, effector and RGS proteins has come from fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) techniques. FRET occurs when two proteins are in close proximity and has been measured between the GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor and RGS4, G-proteins or GIRK channels, but not between GIRK and Gαo (Fowler et al., 2007), directly between Gβγ-proteins and GIRK channels (Raveh et al., 2008) and between GIRK3 and RGS2 (Labouèbe et al., 2007). Further, the formation of a stable physical interaction between G-protein and RGS (independent of G-protein functional state) that is capable of directly contributing to signaling kinetics has also been described (Benians et al., 2005). Taken together, these data suggest that the formation of the quaternary heterocomplex may be a central feature of GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor signaling providing increased potential therapeutic targets for manipulating GABA<sub>B</sub> signaling to treat disease.

VI. GABA<sub>B</sub> Receptor-Dependent Desensitization

Persistent stimulation of GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors that couple to GIRK channels can generate two different kinds of GIRK current responses. In some cases, stimulation of the receptor leads to a GIRK current that faithfully reports the time course of receptor activation (i.e., no decrement with time). Alternatively, persistent stimulation of the receptor can elicit a current that decreases with time, which is referred to as desensitization. In fact, longer stimulation of the receptor can lead to a persistent reduction in GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor-activated current. The extent of GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor-dependent desensitization can be variable, depending on the type of neuron. For example, in peri-aqueductal gray neurons, stimulation of GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors produces little desensitization of GIRK currents while stimulation of those in
laterodorsal tegmental area results in >25% desensitization (Chieng & Christie, 1995). Likewise in the VTA, baclofen stimulation produces a desensitizing GIRK current in DA neurons but not in GABAergic neurons (Cruz et al., 2004). In hippocampus, $GABA_{B}$ receptor-mediated control of GABA release exhibits acute desensitization while both $GABA_{B}$ receptor-mediated inhibition of glutamate release and postsynaptic $GABA_{B}$ receptor-mediated inhibition show little desensitization (Tosetti et al., 2004). In general, the desensitizing response is an important adaptive response of the cell to prevent excessive signaling for particular signaling pathways.

There are several possible ways to generate a desensitizing current. Changes in the signaling of the GPCR, the G-proteins, and/or effector could all lead to smaller responses with time. A well-known mechanism of receptor-dependent desensitization involves phosphorylation of the receptor (Kovoor et al., 1995; Shui et al., 2001). For example, stimulation of β2-adrenergic receptors leads to phosphorylation of the GPCR by receptor kinases (GRKs), and subsequent uncoupling of the G-protein with the receptor (Kovoor et al., 1995; Shui et al., 2001). Prolonged stimulation (tens of minutes) then triggers receptor internalization, which by rapid recycling has been implicated in resensitization of the GPCR (Ferguson, 2001). Other pathways for producing a receptor-dependent desensitizing current have been described that involve changes in G-protein turnover (Chuang et al., 1998; Jeong & Ikeda, 2001; Mutneja et al., 2005; Saitoh et al., 2001), in the membrane phospholipid PIP₂ (Kobrinsky et al., 2000), and/or inhibitory G-proteins (Blanchet & Luscher, 2002).

To study the mechanism of $GABA_{B}$ receptor-dependent desensitization, several labs have heterologously expressed $GABA_{B}$ receptors and GIRK channels in mammalian cells (e.g., HEK293, COS, CHO) or Xenopus oocytes. Similar to hippocampal pyramidal neurons, brief (2 s) but repetitive stimulation of $GABA_{B1/B2}$ receptors decreases the amplitude of GIRK current by ~60% over a period of 10–15 min in HEK293 cells (Couve et al., 2002). PKA phosphorylation of the C-terminal tail attenuated this decrease, suggesting that the stability of $GABA_{B}$ receptors in the membrane is enhanced with PKA-dependent phosphorylation (Couve et al., 2002). Prolonged stimulation (1 h) of $GABA_{B}$ receptors produces desensitization when G-protein receptor kinase 4 (GRK4) is coexpressed with the receptor in HEK-293 cells (Perroy et al., 2003). Surprisingly, the kinase domain of GRK4 was not required for internalization, suggesting that phosphorylation is not involved (Perroy et al., 2003). In CHO cells, long-term (>2 h) stimulation of $GABA_{B}$ receptors also induces internalization (Gonzalez-Maeso et al., 2003), suggesting these cells express an endogenous GRK. In HEK293 cells, on the other hand, a 60 s application of $GABA_{B}$ agonist induced 60% GIRK current desensitization but did not appear to induce $GABA_{B}$ receptor internalization (Mutneja et al., 2005). Instead, the turnover of G-proteins appear to be involved in generating a desensitizing GIRK
current (Mutneja et al., 2005). Heterologous desensitization was observed with mu-opioid receptor and GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors, suggesting that both GPCRs share a common pool of G-proteins and channels (Mutneja et al., 2005). Desensitization was attenuated with coexpression of Gα<sub>q</sub>-Q209L-ΔN, a putative RGS binding protein, as well as a RGS-insensitive Gαo (Mutneja et al., 2005). How do RGS proteins induce receptor-dependent desensitization? One function of RGS proteins is to accelerate the intrinsic GTPase activity of Gα subunits, which promotes the formation of the inactive Gαβγ heterotrimer (Fig. 3). Modeling this effect of RGS on the G-protein turnover cycle shows that acute desensitization of receptor-induced GIRK currents is more extensive if a GTPase-activating protein, such as RGS4, accelerates the GTPase activity of Gα subunits (Chuang et al., 1998).

An increasing number of studies have established a link between RGS protein activity and GIRK current desensitization. Ectopic expression of RGS-insensitive Gαo G-proteins in sympathetic neurons dramatically reduced α2 adrenergic receptor-dependent desensitization of GIRK currents (Jeong & Ikeda, 2001). Similarly, coexpression of RGS proteins in oocytes enhances GIRK current desensitization following stimulation of opioid (Chuang et al., 1998) and muscarinic receptors (Saitoh et al., 2001). In a separate study, expression of two Gα subunits with different activation kinetics modulates the extent of GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor-dependent desensitization (Tosetti et al., 2004). In addition to GIRK channels, RGS proteins appear to modulate desensitization of GPCR-mediated inhibition of Ca<sub>V</sub> channels (Chen & Lambert, 2000; Diverse-Pierluissi et al., 1999; Tosetti et al., 2003).

FIGURE 3 G-protein turnover affects GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor function. Agonist activation of GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor (*GABA<sub>B1/B2</sub>) leads to GTP exchange for GDP on Gαi/o. The activated heterotrimeric complex (Gαi/o<sub>GTP</sub>βγ) then signals to different effectors (e.g., adenylyl cyclase, GIRK, and Ca<sub>V</sub>). The intrinsic GTPase activity of Gαi/o hydrolyzes GTP to GDP, allowing the inactive heterotrimer (Gαi/o<sub>GDP</sub>βγ) to reform. The presence of RGS accelerates the GTPase activity of Gαi/o, leading to less Gαi/o<sub>GTP</sub> and βγ, leading to desensitization of GIRK and Ca<sub>V</sub> currents, and shift in the GABA<sub>B</sub> coupling efficiency to higher concentrations.

VII. Conclusion

The inhibitory GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor system is found throughout the brain and is increasingly implicated in many critical neuronal pathways and diseases including hormone secretion (Li & Stern, 2004), body temperature regulation (Quéva et al., 2003), learning and memory (Scanziani, 2000; Schuler et al., 2001), addiction (Cruz et al., 2004; Jayaram & Steketee, 2004, 2005), absence seizures (Hosford et al., 1992; Liu et al., 1992), epilepsy (Straessle et al., 2003), hyperalgesia (Schuler et al., 2001), gastroesophageal reflux disease (Lehmann, 2009), and anxiety (Knapp et al., 2007). Understanding the basic molecular mechanisms of GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor activity will be crucial in directing targeted pharmaceutical development.
