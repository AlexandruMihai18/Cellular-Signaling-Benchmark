## SUMMARY

Glycosylation is an essential post-translational modification that underlies many biological processes and diseases. α-dystroglycan (α-DG) is a receptor for matrix and synaptic proteins that causes muscular dystrophy and lissencephaly upon its abnormal glycosylation (α-dystroglycanopathies). Here we identify the glycan unit ribitol 5-phosphate (Rbo5P), a phosphoric ester of pentose alcohol, in α-DG. Rbo5P forms a tandem repeat and functions as a scaffold for the formation of the ligand-binding moiety. We show that enzyme activities of three major α-dystroglycanopathy-causing proteins are involved in the synthesis of tandem Rbo5P. Isoprenoid synthase domain-containing (ISPD) is cytidine diphosphate ribitol (CDP-Rbo) synthase. Fukutin and fukutin-related protein are sequentially acting Rbo5P transferases that use CDP-Rbo. Consequently, Rbo5P glycosylation is defective in α-dystroglycanopathy models. Supplementation of CDP-Rbo to ISPD-deficient cells restored α-DG glycosylation. These findings establish the molecular basis of mammalian Rbo5P glycosylation and provide insight into pathogenesis and therapeutic strategies in α-DG-associated diseases.

## INTRODUCTION

α-dystroglycan (α-DG) was originally identified as a laminin receptor in the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex that is defective

Cell Reports 14, 2209–2223, March 8, 2016 ©2016 The Authors 2209
SGK196 (POMK) encodes a kinase that phosphorylates the C6 position of O-Man in CoreM3 ([Yoshida-Moriguchi et al., 2013](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2013.05.047)). The glycan structure directly involved in ligand binding is \([-3\text{Xyl}\alpha1,3\text{GlcA}\beta1-]_n\) (hereafter referred to as the Xyl/GlcA repeat), which is synthesized by the glycosyltransferase LARGE ([Inamori et al., 2012](https://doi.org/10.1038/nature11181)). It has been hypothesized that the Xyl/GlcA repeat branches from the phosphorylated O-Man in CoreM3 via a putative phosphodiester-linked moiety ([Yoshida-Moriguchi et al., 2010](https://doi.org/10.1038/nature09161)). This is called a “post-phosphoryl moiety”; however, its structure is still unknown. In addition, the presence of α-dystroglycanopathy genes with unknown functions (*fukutin*, *FKRP*, *ISPD*, and *TMEM5*) suggests that an additional moiety and a synthetic pathway for α-DG maturation likely exist. To answer these questions and to better understand the pathogenesis of the α-dystroglycanopathies, we attempted to delineate the full functional glycan structure of α-DG.

### RESULTS

#### Identification of Ribitol 5-Phosphate in the Sugar Chain of α-DG
For mass spectrometry (MS)-based structural analysis, we designed a small recombinant α-DG/Fc fusion protein, DGFc<sup>WT</sup>, which contains the wild-type (WT) N-terminal domain and the first 20 amino acids of the mucin-like domain (from Ala314 to Pro333) ([Figure 1A](#fig1)). Mature α-DG-Fc peptides begin with Gln311 because the N-terminal domain is processed during maturation ([Kanagawa et al., 2004](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M402608200)) and LARGE-dependent glycosylation takes place on the first two Thr residues in the mucin-like domain (Thr315 and Thr317) ([Hara et al., 2011b](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M111.257946)). The results of western blotting using the IIH6 antibody, which recognizes the Xyl/GlcA repeat, and a laminin overlay assay suggested that DGFc<sup>WT</sup> is modified with the Xyl/GlcA repeat and possesses laminin-binding activity in NIH 3T3 cells without LARGE overexpression ([Figure 1B](#fig1)). To obtain glycopeptides that contain a functional moiety, we subjected the samples to an anion exchange column after removing the Fc tag, terminal sialic acids, and O-GalNAc-type glycans ([Figure 1A](#fig1)). A stepwise elution with ammonium acetate (NH<sub>4</sub>Ac) enabled us to fractionate the DGFc<sup>WT</sup>-derived glycopeptides (DG<sup>WT</sup>-GPs) according to the length of the negatively charged Xyl/GlcA repeat. MS of the fractions eluted with 0.5 M and 0.75 M NH<sub>4</sub>Ac showed ladder peaks that differed from each other by 308.2 Da, which corresponded to the mass of a Xyl/GlcA unit (132.1 Da for Xyl and 176.1 Da for GlcA) ([Figures 1C and 1D](#fig1)). The mass spectrum suggested the presence of at least 13 Xyl/GlcA repeats, which were sufficient for α-DG to bind laminin ([Goddeeris et al., 2013](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2013.01.010)). To expose the structure connecting the Xyl/GlcA repeat to O-Man glycan, we removed the Xyl/GlcA repeats by introducing a T190M missense mutation in the N-terminal domain; this mutation, identified in a patient with α-dystroglycanopathy, prevents LARGE-dependent glycosylation ([Hara et al., 2011a](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M111.257946)) ([Figure 1A](#fig1)). DGFc<sup>T190M</sup> did not react with laminin or the IIH6 antibody ([Figure 1B](#fig1)). In contrast to DG<sup>WT</sup>-GPs, DG<sup>T190M</sup>-GPs from the 0.5 M NH<sub>4</sub>Ac eluate suggested that the Xyl/GlcA repeat stemmed from GP6138 (6,139.1 plus a Xyl/GlcA unit corresponded to the first ladder signal at 6,447.4) ([Figures 1C and 1E](#fig1)). Indeed, LARGE added the Xyl/GlcA repeat to GP6138 from DG<sup>T190M</sup>-GPs in vitro ([Figure S1](#figS1)), indicating that GP6138 contains the core acceptor structure for LARGE-dependent modifications.

It has been conceived that the Xyl/GlcA modification requires a phosphodiester-linked structure ([Yoshida-Moriguchi et al., 2013](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2013.05.047)). To identify the phosphodiester-linked structure, DG<sup>WT</sup>-GPs from the 0.75 M NH<sub>4</sub>Ac eluate were treated with hydrofluoric acid (HF), which cleaves the phosphodiester linkage of α-DG ([Yoshida-Moriguchi et al., 2010](https://doi.org/10.1038/nature09161)) and DGFc proteins, resulting in a loss of IIH6 reactivity ([Figure 1F](#fig1)). After treatment, the peaks in the high mass region converged into two major ions at *m/z* 5,402.7 and *m/z* 5,322.7 ([Figure 1G](#fig1)), of which the mass of the former ion corresponded well to the GP containing one phosphorylated CoreM3 glycan ([Yoshida-Moriguchi et al., 2010](https://doi.org/10.1038/nature09161)), two CoreM1 glycans ([Chiba et al., 1997](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.272.30.18799)), and one hexose moiety ([Figure 2A](#fig2), green background). The ion at *m/z* 5,322.7 corresponds to the same GP that lacks a phosphate. These results suggest that GP6138 contains a phosphodiester-linked structure of 736.5 Da (6,139.1 minus 5,402.7; hereafter, we describe this moiety as “Structure736”) ([Figure 2A](#fig2), blue background). To identify the components of Structure736, we treated the GP6138-rich fractions from the DG<sup>T190M</sup>-GPs with HF and then subjected the ions in the low mass region to MS/MS. The MS/MS spectrum suggests that Structure736 contains a terminal Xyl/GlcA unit and an alternating repeat of 80 Da and 134 Da ([Figures S2A–S2D](#figS2)). The high resolving power MS elucidated the precise mass of the 134 Da component to be 134.05787 or 134.05791, specifying the elemental composition as C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>10</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (134.05791 Da for theoretical mass) ([Figure 2B](#fig2)). Similarly, the 80 Da moiety was identified as PO<sub>3</sub>H (79.96633) rather than SO<sub>3</sub> (79.95682) ([Figure 2B](#fig2)).

To more easily enable tandem MS for the GPs, we constructed a mutant, DGFc<sup>T320K</sup>, which results in a small peptide following lysylendopeptidase (LEP) digestion ([Figure 1A](#fig1)). This DGFc mutant was properly modified with the laminin-binding glycan ([Figure 1B](#fig1)). We prepared DG<sup>T320K</sup>-GP of 2,986 Da (GP2986), which corresponds to a glycopeptide (QIHATPTPVK) with one phosphorylated CoreM3, one CoreM1, and Structure736, and then subjected it to MS/MS. The results confirmed that GP2986 contains the 80 Da and 134 Da repeat, which is linked to the terminal Xyl/GlcA unit and the core HexNAc-HexNAc at each end ([Figure S2E](#figS2)). More intriguingly, the presence of the product ion at *m/z* 1,452.2 from the precursor indicates that Structure736 is not attached to the phosphate of the innermost O-Man residue.

There were three candidate residues with the chemical formula C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>5</sub> (hydrated C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>10</sub>O<sub>4</sub>): xylitol, D/L-arabitol, and ribitol (Rbo). However, mammalian cells are not known to utilize these compounds for post-translational modifications. Interestingly, microorganisms, such as Gram-positive bacteria, use a repeating unit of ribitol 5-phosphate (Rbo5P), which forms a phosphodiester-linked polyol structure, teichoic acid, as a major cell wall component ([Brown et al., 2013](https://doi.org/10.1038/nrmicro3078)). We hence performed composition analysis of DGFc<sup>T190M</sup> using gas chromatography (GC)-MS and detected three peaks (Gp1, Gp2, and Gp3) with

similar retention times as the standard Rbo5P (Rp1, Rp2, and Rp3) (Figure 3A). The mass spectra of these peaks are highly matched to those of species with the structural formulas of anhy-

drous acetylated Rbo and acetylated Rbo (Figure 3B). We also confirmed that this GC analysis is able to distinguish Rbo from xylitol and arabitol (data not shown). These data indicate that

The product ion mass spectrum from the precursors at m/z 367 for double charge or m/z 735 for single charge suggests that Structure 736 contains a Xyl/GlcA unit (orange arrows) and moieties consisting of 80 Da and 134 Da (blue arrows). The fragments of the 134 Da and 80 Da moieties (indicated by a, b, and c) were cross-referenced to the exact mass database, and the results are shown in the table.

DGFc<sup>T190M</sup> contains Rbo residues and that the moiety consisting of 80 Da and 134 Da structures is Rbo phosphate (RboP).

### ISPD Is a CDP-Ribitol Synthase

In Gram-positive bacteria, the Rbo5P polymer is synthesized by the TarK and TarL enzymes (Tar; Teichoic acid ribitol), which use CDP-Rbo as a donor substrate, and CDP-Rbo is synthesized by the Tarl enzyme from cytidine triphosphate (CTP) and Rbo5P (Brown et al., 2013). We found that bacterial Tarl shared homology with mammalian ISPD, which is one of the causative gene products for α-dystroglycanopathy (Figure S3A) (Willer et al., 2012; Roscioli et al., 2012). To determine whether ISPD possesses CDP-Rbo synthase activity, we prepared His-tagged human ISPD, incubated it with CTP and Rbo5P, and then analyzed the products by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). After the reaction of ISPD with both Rbo5P and CTP, a novel peak was detected (Figure 4A, indicated by “P”), and the same peak was observed in the Tarl enzyme products (Figure S3B). MS results of both products showed the same mass of 537 Da, which was compatible with CDP-Rbo (Figures 4B and S3C). Thus, the enzymatic properties of human ISPD were identical to those of bacterial Tarl. Pathogenic mutations of the ISPD gene impaired CDP-Rbo synthesizing activity (Figures 4C and S3A). These data indicate that ISPD is a mammalian CDP-Rbo synthase.

### Fukutin and FKRP Are Ribitol 5-Phosphate Transferases

The fukutin family is predicted to encode a phosphoryl-ligand transferase (Aravind and Koonin, 1999; Kuchta et al., 2009).

Importantly, a through-bond ${}^{1}\mathrm{H}-{ }^{31} \mathrm{P}$ correlation was observed in the s-fukutin product between the phosphorus and GalNAc H3 (Figure 6A). Thus, Rbo5P is linked to the C3 position of GalNAc via a phosphodiester linkage (Rbo5P-3GalNAc). Therefore, fukutin is an enzyme that transfers Rbo5P from CDP-Rbo to the C3 position of GalNAc in the CoreM3 glycan (CDP-Rbo: GalNAc-3 Rbo5P transferase).

To determine the precise structure of the FKRP-dependent moiety, we performed large-scale preparation of sFKRP products from Rbo5P-3GalNAcβ1,3GlcNAcβ-pNp (Figures S4E and S4F), and analyzed them by ${}^{1} \mathrm{H}-{ }^{-}{ }^{13} \mathrm{C}$ HSQC and $2 \mathrm{D}{ }^{1} \mathrm{H}-{ }^{31} \mathrm{P}$ HMBC experiments. In the ${}^{1} \mathrm{H}-{ }^{13} \mathrm{C}$ HSQC spectra, significant chemical shift changes were observed for the signals originating from the first Rbo5P residue (Rbo-C1 in Glycan2 and Glycan3), and additional peaks were detected from the second Rbo residue (Rbo'; Figures 6B and S5A). Furthermore, a through-bond ${}^{1} \mathrm{H}-{ }^{31} \mathrm{P}$ correlation was observed in the sFKRP product between the phosphorus of the second Rbo5P residue (Rbo'5P) and the H1 of the first Rbo5P residue (Figure 6B). These NMR data revealed that the second Rbo (Rbo') is attached to the C1 position of the first Rbo residue via a phosphodiester linkage (Figures 6B and S5A). Therefore, FKRP is an enzyme that transfers the Rbo5P from CDP-Rbo to the C1 position of the first Rbo5P (CDP-Rbo: Rbo5P-1 Rbo5P transferase).

We further analyzed the Rbo5P-modified products that were enzymatically synthesized, by 1D ${ }^{31} \mathrm{P}$ NMR analysis (Figure 6C). PhosphoCoreM3-peptide showed a signal originating from Man-6-phosphate (Man6P). A peak at $-3 \mathrm{ppm}$ was observed in both Rbo5P-3GalNAcβ1,3GlcNAcβ-pNp and Rbo5P-phosphoCoreM3-peptide, which was assigned to the phosphorous of the first Rbo5P residue. The products of the sFKRP reaction (Rbo'5P-1Rbo5P-3GalNAcβ1,3GlcNAcβ-pNp and Rbo'5P-1Rbo5P-phosphoCoreM3-peptide) showed an additional peak ($-2 \mathrm{ppm}$), which was assigned to the phosphorous from the second Rbo5P (Rbo'5P). The 1D ${ }^{31} \mathrm{P}$ spectrum of purified DG${ }^{\mathrm{T} 190 \mathrm{M}}$-GP6138 showed three signals, likely originating from Man6P, the first Rbo5P, and the second

novel peak (Figure 5D, indicated as “P2”) and the product showed an increase in mass of 214 Da (2,211.1 minus 1,997.0; Figures 5B and 5E). These data indicate that sFKRP transfers the second Rbo5P to the s-fukutin products. Missense mutations found in α-dystroglycanopathy patients and in the putative catalytic sites reduced sFKRP enzyme activity (Figures 5F and S4A). Finally, we fractionated mouse liver membrane preparations and performed fukutin and FKRP enzyme assays (Figure S4B). The distributions of both enzyme activities were similar to the distribution of a Golgi marker protein, which suggests that fukutin and FKRP activities reside in the Golgi apparatus.

### Determination of the Tandem Ribitol Structure

To determine the precise structure of the fukutin-dependent moiety, we conducted large-scale preparation of s-fukutin products using the acceptor substrate GalNAcβ1,3GlcNAcβ-pNp (pNp, p-nitrophenyl). We confirmed that s-fukutin can transfer Rbo5P to GalNAcβ1,3GlcNAcβ-pNp (Figures S4C and S4D). The original acceptor substrate (GalNAcβ1,3GlcNAcβ-pNp) and the purified s-fukutin product were analyzed by a series of NMR measurements, including ${}^{1} \mathrm{H}-{ }^{13} \mathrm{C}$ heteronuclear single quantum correlation (HSQC) and $2 \mathrm{D}{ }^{1} \mathrm{H}-{ }^{31} \mathrm{P}$ heteronuclear multiple-bond correlation (HMBC). In the ${}^{1} \mathrm{H}-{ }^{13} \mathrm{C}$ HSQC spectra, a ${ }^{13} \mathrm{C}$ downfield shift (~4 ppm) was observed at the GalNAc C3 position after the s-fukutin reaction (Figures 6A and S5A).
Rbo5P (Rbo’5P). Thus, the tandem Rbo5P moiety is present in the α-DG protein expressed in mammalian cells. Finally, to corroborate that the tandem Rbo5P is not modified on the Man6P residue in the CoreM3 glycan, we analyzed the s-fukutin and sFKRP products from phosphoCoreM3-peptide by NMR ([Figures S5B–S5D](#figs5)). The GalNAc-C3 and Rbo-C1 signals showed significant chemical shift changes after the s-fukutin and sFKRP reactions, respectively; however, the chemical shift of the Man-C6 signal did not change after the reactions. These observations support that the tandem Rbo5P moiety extends from the GalNAc residue, and not from the Man residue, in the CoreM3 glycan ([Figure 6D](#fig6)).

### Defects of Ribitol 5-Phosphate Glycosylation in α-Dystroglycanopathy Models and Potential Therapeutic Strategies

To examine whether Rbo5P glycosylation is affected in α-dystroglycanopathy, we generated HAP1 cells with a disruption in ISPD, fukutin, or FKRP genes as disease models, by CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing ([Figure S6](#figs6)). We confirmed the disruption of functional α-DG glycosylation in these cells by western blot analysis using the IIH6 antibody. Rescue experiments confirmed that the abnormal glycosylation was caused by a loss of the targeted genes. We first expressed DGFc<sup>WT</sup> in normal HAP1 cells and analyzed DG<sup>WT</sup>-GPs from the 0.25 M and 0.5 M NH<sub>4</sub>Ac eluates by MS ([Figures 7A and 7B](#fig7)). The data indicated the presence of ions containing Structure736 in the DG<sup>WT</sup>-GP preparations and that the Xyl/GlcA units were modified on these GPs ([Figure 7B](#fig7)). We then performed MS analyses on DG<sup>WT</sup>-GPs prepared from the HAP1 cells with each α-dystroglycanopathy gene defect. Although the ions containing the phosphorylated CoreM3 glycan were detected in the ISPD- or fukutin-disrupted cells, no signals were assigned to GPs containing the Rbo5P moiety ([Figures 7C and 7D](#fig7)). These data indicate that DG<sup>WT</sup>-GPs prepared from ISPD- or fukutin-disrupted HAP1 cells lacked Structure736 and also support the idea that fukutin acts as a priming enzyme for Rbo5P modification. In the FKRP-disrupted cells, GPs containing a portion of Strucuture736 (single Rbo5P, 214 Da) were observed ([Figure 7E](#fig7)), which supports the idea that FKRP synthesizes the second Rbo5P in the tandem structure. Taken together, these results confirmed that ISPD, fukutin, and FKRP are required for the synthesis of the tandem Rbo5P structure and indicate that Rbo5P glycosylation defects cause the loss of functional glycosylation of α-DG, resulting in α-dystroglycanopathy.

Our data also suggest that formation of the tandem Rbo5P structure requires CDP-Rbo and that ISPD-deficient α-dystroglycanopathy is caused by a lack of cellular CDP-Rbo. To examine whether supplementation of CDP-Rbo restores the functional glycosylation of α-DG, we treated ISPD-deficient HAP1 or HEK293 cells with exogenous CDP-Rbo ([Figure 7F](#fig7)). The addition of CDP-Rbo to the cell culture medium restored the functional glycosylation of α-DG. In HEK293 cells, pretreatment of CDP-Rbo with a transfection reagent increased the efficacy of the restoration of α-DG glycosylation. These results raise the possibility of CDP-Rbo supplementation as a treatment for α-dystroglycanopathy patients.

### DISCUSSION

Our data demonstrate that tandem Rbo5P is a “post-phosphoryl moiety.” The structure required for the functional maturation of α-DG was determined to be “Rbo5P-1Rbo5P-3GalNAcβ1,3GlcNAcβ1,4Man(6P)-O” ([Figure 6D](#fig6)). Post-phosphoryl modifications, including LARGE-dependent Xyl/GlcA repeats, have been thought to extend from phosphorylated Man ([Yoshida-Moriguchi et al., 2010](#ref1)); however, our present data indicate that the monoester-linked phosphate on the C6-position of O-Man exists independently of the HF-sensitive Rbo5P tandem structure and that the Xyl/GlcA repeats extend from the tandem Rbo5P. We speculate that mannosyl phosphorylation determines the substrate specificity of Rbo5P and/or Xyl/GlcA modifications. Recently, B4GAT1 was shown to be a GlcA transferase, which synthesizes an acceptor primer necessary for LARGE-dependent Xyl/GlcA repeat formation ([Praissemann et al., 2014](#ref2); [Willer et al., 2014](#ref3)). Structure736 contains a LARGE-independent Xyl/GlcA unit, which can be elongated by LARGE activity ([Figures 2 and S1](#fig2)). These data also confirm that the Rbo5P tandem structure is a central part of the post-phosphoryl moiety and is required for the functions of α-DG.

We subsequently identified the activities of three α-dystroglycanopathy-causing proteins, namely, ISPD, fukutin, and FKRP, to be involved in Rbo5P glycosylation ([Figure 6D](#fig6)). ISPD is a CDP-Rbo synthase that uses Rbo5P and CTP. This finding suggests that cellular levels of Rbo5P and CTP may control the Rbo5P modification of α-DG. In bacteria, Rbo5P is synthesized by the TarJ enzyme from ribulose 5-phosphate and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate ([Brown et al., 2013](#ref4)). In mammals, however, neither the ortholog of TarJ nor the biosynthetic pathway of Rbo5P is currently known. It is hence important in the future to identify proteins that are involved in mammalian Rbo5P biosynthesis, because they may regulate the functional glycosylation of α-DG and thus may cause α-dystroglycanopathy upon their mutations.

Fukutin and FKRP are both Rbo5P transferases that use CDP-Rbo as a common donor substrate. On the other hand, the selectivity of fukutin and FKRP for acceptor substrates showed a distinct difference: FKRP and fukutin are not able to transfer Rbo5P to GalNAc and to the first Rbo5P residue, respectively. Thus, formation of the tandem Rbo5P structure likely needs to be performed in a sequential manner. In addition, we have not observed polymer formation of more than two Rbo5P residues by the activities of fukutin or FKRP. These data suggest the existence of strict mechanisms that determine substrate specificity or regulate the formation of the tandem RboP structure. It is unknown whether negative regulatory factors of the tandem Rbo5P structure exist, for example, phosphodiesterase-like activities that cleave the internal phosphodiester linkage of the Rbo5P tandem structure. If such activities exist, they may be able to regulate the functional glycosylation of α-DG, and the elevated expression or hyperactivation of such enzymes may result in the abnormal glycosylation of α-DG.

Several studies have suggested the Golgi localization of fukutin and FKRP based on the localization of exogenously expressed proteins ([Kobayashi et al., 1998](#ref5); [Esapa et al., 2002](#ref6)). Our fractionation and enzyme assays also suggest that

endogenous fukutin and FKRP activities are localized in the Golgi. Given that the LARGE-dependent Xyl/GlcA repeat is also synthesized in the Golgi (Yoshida-Moriguchi et al., 2013), we propose that the Rbo5P modification occurs in the Golgi apparatus. We showed that some disease-causing missense mutations in fukutin or FKRP proteins directly reduced their enzyme activity, but the mislocalization of these proteins containing disease-causing missense mutations has been also reported (Esapa et al., 2002; Tachikawa et al., 2012). A protein motif search and deglycosylation experiments suggested that both fukutin and FKRP are N-glycosylated proteins (data not shown). Mutations in their potential glycosylation sites may cause α-dystroglycanopathy by altering the cellular localization of or the protein stability of fukutin and FKRP. Indeed, a missense mutation in the potential glycosylation site of FKRP (p.S174C) has been reported (Quijano-Roy et al., 2006).

Recent studies reported that ISPD mutations are a relatively common cause of α-dystroglycanopathy (Willer et al., 2012; Roscioli et al., 2012; Cirak et al., 2013). In Japan, most cases of α-dystroglycanopathy are confirmed to be FCMD, which is caused by mutations in fukutin (Kobayashi et al., 1998; Matsumoto et al., 2005). LGMD2I, which is caused by mutations in FKRP, is a common form of LGMD in western countries (Brockington et al., 2001b). Taken together, a substantial proportion of α-dystroglycanopathy is caused by abnormalities in the Rbo5P glycosylation pathway. Although 18 genes are currently known to cause abnormal glycosylation of α-DG upon their mutation, resulting in α-dystroglycanopathy (Yoshida-Moriguchi and Campbell, 2015), the causative genes for a proportion of α-dystroglycanopathy cases still remain to be identified. Some of the as-yet-unidentified causative genes of α-dystroglycanopathy may function in the Rbo5P glycosylation pathway, including CDP-Rbo biosynthesis. Clarifying the Rbo5P glycosylation pathway may accelerate our understanding of the pathogenesis of α-dystroglycanopathy.

We showed that the addition of CDP-Rbo restored the functional glycosylation of α-DG in ISPD-deficient cells, which indicates that metabolic components such as Rbo5P and CDP-Rbo in the Rbo5P glycosylation pathway can be targets of molecular supplementation therapy for α-dystroglycanopathy. Although the glycosylation pattern of α-DG varies among different cells and tissues, the IIH6-sensitive functional glycan is present in many cells and tissues (Kuga et al., 2012). α-DG in HEK293 and HAP cells contains functional glycans, and gene editing and rescue experiments validated their suitability for their use as disease model cells; however, further studies using animal models will be necessary for the development of CDP-ribitol supplementation therapy. Several lines of evidence have established that abnormal glycosylation of α-DG contributes to the invasive and proliferative phenotypes of cancer cells (Singh et al., 2004; Bao et al., 2009; Miller et al., 2015). Recently, an association between the downregulation of ISPD and mortality in clear cell renal cell carcinoma was reported (Miller et al., 2015). Thus, our findings suggest the involvement of the Rbo5P glycosylation pathway in tumor formation, as well as the possibility of molecular CDP-Rbo supplementation as a therapy for cancers.

Because Rbo5P has only been found in bacteria (Brown et al., 2013) and some plants such as Adonis vernalis (Negm and Marlow, 1985), it is surprising that mammalian cells use Rbo5P as a functional component of post-translational modifications. Rbo5P is a component of the teichoic acids in bacterial cell walls, which play various roles in bacterial physiology such as cell shape determination, cell division, and host defenses (Brown et al., 2013). How vertebrates acquired the Rbo5P modification during evolution, including the possibility of its horizontal transmission, would be interesting to investigate. As for its physiological functions, Rbo5P glycosylation is expected to be involved in many biological processes, such as embryonic and postnatal tissue development, as demonstrated by studies using fukutin and FKRP transgenic animals (Kurahashi et al., 2005; Ackroyd et al., 2009; Kanagawa et al., 2013). An intriguing question arises as to whether Rbo5P-containing glycoconjugates other than α-DG also exist. Given that DG-deficient mice recapitulate aspects of fukutin- or FKRP-deficient α-dystroglycanopathies (Moore et al., 2002; Cohn et al., 2002), α-DG is thought to be a primary target of Rbo5P modification. We cannot exclude the possibility of the existence of a Rbo5P transferase other than fukutin and FKRP, as well as that of a Rbo5P-containing glycoprotein or glycolipid other than α-DG. Investigating these possibilities will lead to a deeper understanding of Rbo5P modifications.

The complexity of the glycosylation machinery and the possible existence of unidentified sugar units may hinder our understanding of glycosylation-dependent biological processes and the pathogenesis of human diseases. We propose that Rbo5P glycosylation is an essential modification in mammals and that defects in the Rbo5P glycosylation pathway underlie the pathogenesis of muscular dystrophy and possibly of cancer metastasis and virus infection. Together, our results expand our knowledge on post-translational modification and establish an additional disease mechanism.

## EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES

### Glycopeptide Purification from the DGFc Proteins

DGFc proteins were secreted into the cell culture media and recovered with Protein A-beads. The DGFc proteins were eluted with 0.1 M glycine-HCl (pH 2.5) and then neutralized with a final concentration of 0.2 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). PreScission protease treatment to cleave the Fc tag was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions (GE Healthcare Life Science). The cleaved Fc tag and the protease were removed by Protein A-beads and glutathione beads, respectively. The samples were desalted using a Zeba spin column (Life Technologies) and then freeze-dried. The freeze-dried samples were dissolved with 20 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) and treated

(D and E) Enzyme reaction of FKRP. Either PhosphoCoreM3-peptide (upper panel) or the s-fukutin product (P1, lower panels) was used as an acceptor substrate for sFKRP. P1, unreacted acceptor substrate (s-fukutin product). P2, sFKRP enzyme product. The fraction containing the sFKRP products (P2 in D) was analyzed by MS in the negative ion mode (E).

with α2-3,6,8,9-neuraminidase (Merck Millipore) at 37°C for 6 hr and then with O-glycosidase (New England Biolabs) at 37°C for 12 hr to remove the terminal sialic acids and O-GalNAc-type glycans. The samples were subjected to an anion exchange column (HiTrap Q XL beads, GE Healthcare Life Sciences) and were fractionated by stepwise elution with NH₄Ac (0.1, 0.25, 0.5, and 0.75 M). The fraction of the 0.5 M NH₄Ac elution contained the DG-GPs with Xyl/GlcA repeats, whereas the fraction of the 0.25 M NH₄Ac elution contained DG-GPs without Xyl/GlcA repeats. The fractions were freeze-dried and then analyzed by MS or further purified by HPLC. For HPLC purification, the freeze-dried samples were dissolved with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), loaded onto an Inertsil ODS column (2.0 × 150 mm, GL Sciences), and eluted with a linear gradient elution of acetonitrile (10%–50%) in 0.1% TFA. To obtain a short glycopeptide (QIHATPTPVK) from DGFc^{T320K}, the glycopeptide (QIHATPTPVKAIGPPTTAIQEPP) separated by anion exchange chromatography was digested with LEP (Wako Pure Chemicals Industries) in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate and purified by HPLC using a PBr column (COSMOSIL, Nacalai Tesque) with a linear gradient elution of acetonitrile (10%–50%) in 0.1% TFA.

### Mass Spectrometry

MALDI-TOF or nanoelectrospray ionization (nanoESI) MS was used to elucidate the glycopeptide structures. MALDI linear TOF measurements were carried out on a Voyager DE Pro MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer equipped with a nitrogen pulsed laser (337 nm) (Applied Biosystems). Typically, 0.1–1 pmol of the glycopeptide samples was dissolved in a 1 μl solution of 10 mg/ml of 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHB) in a 0.1% TFA and 30% acetonitrile solution on a MALDI sample target and dried. The measurements were carried out in positive ion mode. For MS/MS analysis, nanoESI MS was carried out using an LTQ XL ion trap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The samples were dissolved in a 50% methanol solution and directly infused into the mass spectrometer using a PicoTip emitter (New Objective). The measurements were carried out in the negative ion mode. Typical nanoESI source conditions were 1.6 kV source voltage, –42.8 V capillary voltage, and 200°C capillary temperature.

A high-resolution MS of Structure 736 was carried out on an LTQ-Orbitrap Velos Pro (Thermo Fisher Scientific) equipped with a nanoESI ion source in the negative ion mode. The spray voltage was set at 0.8 kV, with a distance of 3–5 mm between the top of the needle and the inlet of the mass spectrometer. The resolution of the equipment was set at 100,000, and the capillary temperature was set at 200°C. The samples were dissolved in a 20% methanol solution and then directly infused into the mass spectrometer using a nanoESI tip (Cellomics Tip, HUMANIX). The electron multiplier gain, Fourier transform, storage transmission, and mass accuracy were calibrated using polytyrosine (*m*/*z* 180.06662, *m*/*z* 506.19327, and *m*/*z* 995.38326), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The prediction of the elemental compositions from the measured accurate masses was performed by Kazusa Molecular Formula Searcher and the exact mass database of Kazusa DNA Research Institute.

### Enzyme Assays for Tarl and ISPD

The cDNA encoding Tarl of *Bacillus subtilis* subsp. *spizizenii* TU-B-10 was chemically synthesized by GenScript, cloned into the pET-22b(+) vector (Merck Millipore), which was modified to lack the *pelB* signal sequence, and expressed in Rosetta2 *E. coli* cells (Merck Millipore). The cells were ultra-sonicated in Tris-buffered saline (TBS), and the recombinant Tarl was purified using COSMOGEL His-Accept. The expression vectors for human ISPD and its mutants were transfected into HEK293T cells using Effectene. The cells were ultra-sonicated in TBS, and the ISPD proteins were purified using COSMOGEL His-Accept. The bound proteins were eluted with 0.5 M imidazole in TBS, concentrated, and buffer-exchanged into 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 50 mM NaCl using an Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter unit. The ISPD reaction was performed as previously reported, with modifications ([Baur et al., 2009](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2009.02.027)). Briefly, the reaction mixture contained 100 mM MOPS-NaOH (pH 7.4), 10 mM MgCl₂, 1 mM CTP, and 2 mM Rbo5P in a total volume of 40 μl and was incubated for 2 hr at 37°C. CDP-Rbo synthase activity was monitored using an HPLC-based assay. The product was run on a 4.6 × 150 mm COSMOSIL PBr column (Nacalai Tesque) by isocratic elution with 3% methanol/97% 50 mM acetic acid-triethylamine (pH 7.3) at 30°C and detected by absorbance at 254 nm using the Prominence HPLC system. The separated peak product was collected and lyophilized for MS.

#### Enzyme Assay for Fukutin and FKRP

The s-fukutin or sFKRP expression vectors were transfected into HEK293T cells. The recombinant proteins were immunoprecipitated from the culture supernatants with an agarose-conjugated anti-c-Myc antibody. The proteins bound to agarose were used as the enzyme sources. The enzymatic reactions were performed in a 50 μl reaction volume containing 100 mM MES (pH 6.5), 0.5 mM CDP-Rbo, 0.1 mM acceptor peptide, 10 mM MnCl₂, 10 mM MgCl₂, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 25 μl of the enzyme-bound agarose at 37°C for 16 hr. PhosphoCoreM3-peptide and Rbo5P-phosphoCoreM3-peptide were used as acceptors for s-fukutin and sFKRP, respectively. Each product was separated by reversed-phase HPLC with a Mightysil RP-18GP Aqua column (5 × 250 mm) (Kanto Chemical). Solvent A was 0.1% TFA in distilled water, and solvent B was 0.1% TFA in acetonitrile. The peptide was eluted at a flow rate of 1 ml/min using a linear gradient of 0%–40% solvent B. The peptide separation was monitored by absorbance at 214 nm, and the products P1 and P2 were analyzed by MS.

For the reaction using pNp-oligosaccharides as the acceptor substrates, secreted s-fukutin and sFKRP were purified using COSMOGEL His-Accept or cOmplete His-Tag Purification Resin (Roche). The bound protein was eluted with 0.5 M imidazole in TBS, concentrated, and buffer-exchanged into 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 50 mM NaCl using an Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter unit. The s-fukutin enzymatic reaction was performed in 2 mM GalNAcβ1,3GlcNAcβ-pNp (Tokyo Chemical Industry), 4 mM CDP-Rbo, 10 mM MnCl₂, 10 mM MgCl₂, and 100 mM MOPS-NaOH (pH 7.4) for 16 hr at 37°C. The product was run on a 4.6 × 150 mm COSMOSIL 5C₁₈-AR-II column (Nacalai Tesque) by isocratic elution with 12.5% acetonitrile/87.5% 50 mM ammonium acetate (pH 4.0) at 30°C and detected by measuring the absorbance at 300 nm using an HPLC system. The product was collected and lyophilized for MS and NMR analyses. The FKRP enzymatic reaction was performed in 1 mM Rbo5P-3GalNAcβ1,3GlcNAcβ-pNp (s-fukutin product), 2 mM CDP-Rbo, 10 mM MnCl₂, 10 mM MgCl₂, and 100 mM MOPS-NaOH (pH 7.4) for 16 hr at 37°C. The product was run on a 4.6 × 150 mm COSMOSIL 5C₁₈-AR-II column by linear gradient elution with 0%–30% acetonitrile/100%–70% 20 mM triethylamine acetate (pH 7.0) for 30 min at 30°C and detected by measuring the absorbance at 300 nm using HPLC system. The separated peak sample was collected and lyophilized for MS and NMR analyses.

### NMR Analysis

The NMR spectra of pNP-derivatives and glycopeptides were recorded with 500 and 600 MHz spectrometers (BrukerBioSpin) using a 5-mm TXI cryogenic

NMR signals of the s-fukutin acceptor substrate (Glycan1: GalNAcβ1,3GlcNAcβ-pNp, black signals) and s-fukutin reaction product (Glycan2: Rbo5P-3GalNAcβ1,3GlcNAcβ-pNp, red signals) are shown in layers (A). NMR spectra of the sFKRP product (Glycan3: Rbo’5P-1Rbo5P-3GalNAcβ1,3GlcNAcβ-pNp) are shown (B).

(C) 1D ^{31}P-NMR analysis. The s-fukutin and sFKRP products from the acceptor substrates (GalNAcβ1,3GlcNAcβ-pNp and phosphoCoreM3-peptide) and purified DG^{T190M}-GP6138 were analyzed. The variations in the ^{31}P chemical shift of the Man6P group between samples are most likely due to the differences in the pH of each sample, which could influence the chemical shift ([Mo et al., 2011](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2011.02.017)).

probe, a BBO probe, and a Prodigy probe. The probe temperature was set at 25°C. The samples were dissolved in D₂O (99.99 atom% D), and the ¹H chemical shifts were reported relative to the external standard of 4,4-dimethyl-4-silapentane-1-sulfonic acid. The ¹³C and ³¹P chemical shifts were calibrated using an indirect reference based on the X/¹H resonance ratio of 0.251449530 (¹³C/¹H) and 0.404808636 (³¹P/¹H). NMR signals were assigned by a series of one- and two-dimensional measurements including 1D ¹H, 1D ³¹P, 2D ¹H-¹H double quantum filtered-correlation spectroscopy (DQF-COSY), homonuclear Hartmann-Hahn spectroscopy (HOHAHA), nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY), ¹H-¹³C HSQC, ¹H-¹³C HSQC-total correlation spectroscopy (TOCSY), and ¹H-³¹P HMBC spectra. The NMR data were processed with XWIN-NMR (ver. 3.5) and TopSpin (ver 2.1), and the spectra were displayed using XWIN-PLOT (ver. 3.5).
