# Confounding B-cell defences: lessons from a staphylococcal superantigen

**Gregg J. Silverman and Carl S. Goodyear**

Abstract | Studies of microbial superantigens that target large clonal sets of B cells through conserved antigen-receptor-variable-region sites are providing new insights into the mechanisms of B-cell activation-induced cell death. These investigations have shown differences between the clonal regulation of follicular B cells (B2 cells) and the innate-like marginal-zone B cells and B1 cells, and have also shown how B-cell superantigens can affect specialized host defences against infection. Agents designed to emulate the properties of B-cell superantigens might also provide new approaches for the treatment of B-cell-mediated autoimmune and neoplastic diseases.

### Fab
Fragment of an antibody that includes the variable regions of the heavy and light chains that directly interact for binding of an antigen, as well as the light-chain constant region and the first constant-region domain of the heavy chain.

### Key functional features of the adaptive immune system
The key functional features of the adaptive immune system derive from the capacity of lymphocyte clones to respond in a carefully regulated, antigen-receptor-mediated manner that leads to selective activation and clonal expansion, in which daughter cells then differentiate to gain specialized effector functions. Long-term persistence of clonal remnants is necessary to maintain immune memory after each new antigenic exposure, as these briefly expanded clones undergo a controlled collapse.

During their co-evolution with the immune system, microorganisms have found diverse mechanisms to thwart these host defences. There is now substantial evidence of microbial factors that affect immune responsiveness through interactions that are analogous to those described for T cells (BOX 1) but that instead preferentially affect the B-cell subsets responsible for antibacterial responses. These microbial proteins, which were first identified based on their ability to interact with secreted immunoglobulin, can have immunomodulatory properties that derive from the targeting of a membrane-associated immunoglobulin, the B-cell receptor (BCR). These interactions between microbial proteins and BCR efficiently co-opt the molecular pathways of B-cell activation to cause large-scale deletion of B cell clones that can result in potentially devastating defects in the function of the immune system. In this Review, we discuss the mechanisms by which microbial B-cell superantigens target B cells, how such agents can trigger activation-induced cell death (AICD), and the implications of these interactions for host immune responsiveness.

### Properties of B-cell superantigens
It has been known for a long time that some microbial products can induce lymphocyte activation. Following the characterization of the T-cell receptor (TCR), bacterial and viral proteins were identified that are unlike other mitogens in that their specific recognition by TCRs causes T-cell proliferation (reviewed in REF.1). Whereas conventional peptide antigens generally interact with less than 0.1% of the naive lymphocyte repertoire, based on studies of such T-cell-specific factors (BOX 1), a superantigen was defined as a factor that can have antigen-receptor-mediated interactions with a large proportion of the lymphocyte pool (often more than 5%). This type of response is known as a supractonal response. Although it was not long before bacterial and viral factors were characterized that showed very similar interactions with the BCR, only in recent years has a fuller understanding of the greater immunobiological implications of such B-cell superantigens come to light.

### General structural features
Much of what is known about the structure–function relationships of B-cell superantigens has come from investigations of Staphylococcal protein A (SpA) and Peptostreptococcus magnus protein L (PpL). SpA and PpL have recently been characterized in crystallographic complexes with human fragment of antigen binding (Fab)^{2,3} (TABLE 1). These studies show that a B-cell superantigen can interact with conserved sites in the variable regions of either heavy (V_H) or light (V_L) chains of an immunoglobulin. These conserved sites are outside the conventional antigen-binding region of an antibody (FIG. 1). For example, SpA and PpL interact with BCR contact sites that consist of highly conserved residues

Box 1 | Superantigens for T cells
The concept of superantigens dates to the discovery that some mouse strains had previously unmapped genetic loci responsible for vigorous MHC-restricted reactions when their lymphocytes were mixed with those of otherwise congenic strains<sup>97</sup>. These responses, which were originally attributed to minor lymphocyte stimulating (mls) antigens, were subsequently found to be directed against endogenous retroviral products that were bound to MHC<sup>98</sup>. The responses resulted in the deletion of immature T cells and activation of mature T cells. Superantigens from endogenous (or infectious) mouse mammary tumour virus (MMTV) and staphylococcal enterotoxins have broad reactivity with a large proportion of the T-cell pool. This broad reactivity was shown to depend mainly on contact residues in the Vβ region of the T-cell receptor (TCR), with little or no contribution from the conformational TCR surface composed of Vα, Jα, Vβ, Dβ, Nβ and Jβ TCR components that contribute to the recognition of conventional peptide–MHC complexes.

For recognition of a T-cell superantigen, the microbial protein is arrayed on membrane-associated MHC molecules, without previous processing, to provide a highly multivalent array for effective TCR engagement and crosslinking. Experimental studies of superantigens for T cells have provided an invaluable insight into the signalling, cytokine and cognate parameters of antigen-receptor-mediated stimulation. However, the intrinsic natures of B-cell superantigens and T-cell superantigens are in many ways very different. The mitogenic activities of T-cell superantigens involve their direct binding to membrane-bound MHC class II molecules of antigen-presenting cells. This direct binding mimics (or co-opts) the mechanism of presentation for conventional antigen, to allow multivalent triggering of T cells with the appropriate TCR. This leads to the expansion of the T-cell population and then collapse due to exhaustion (or accelerated consumption) of cytokines that are otherwise required for cell survival.

biological biases against replacement mutations occurring during the somatic hypermutation of these framework-region sites and this serves to retain the frequency and strength of superantigen-binding interactions in the expressed repertoire.

The binding affinities of naive B cells for B-cell superantigens are not insignificant and are similar to those of primary antibodies for conventional antigens (~10<sup>-6</sup> M)<sup>6,7</sup>. For an antigenic ligand to induce lymphocyte activation, it must crosslink membrane-associated antigen receptors. T-cell and B-cell superantigens have evolved different structural strategies to accomplish this goal. For recognition by T cells, T-cell superantigens are displayed by MHC interactions on T-cell surfaces without the need for intracellular processing. By comparison, all known B-cell superantigens can crosslink BCRs as they are naturally expressed as oligovalent or multivalent arrays of active Fab-binding domains (as listed in the following sections), because they often contain tandem linear repetitions of near identical polypeptide domains.

Staphylococcal protein A: a model B-cell superantigen. Our first views of the defining properties of B-cell superantigens developed from the study of what has become the prototypic B-cell superantigen, SpA (TABLE 1). SpA is a 42-kDa secreted membrane protein that is composed of five homologous domains of 56–61 amino acids, which fold into triple α-helical bundles that are linked in tandem to produce an extended structure in solution. Although SpA can also bind other host proteins, including the heavy chain constant-region that is shared by many IgG antibodies, each of the five extracellular domains contains a Fab-binding site<sup>6</sup>. The Fab-binding site of the superantigen, which is generated from two of the α-helices<sup>2</sup>, gives the superantigen the capacity to target B cells that express V<sub>H</sub>3-family-related antibodies<sup>8–11</sup>, enabling interactions with ~30–50% of circulating B cells in humans<sup>12</sup>.

Peptostreptococcus magnus protein L. Investigations pioneered by Björk and co-workers<sup>13</sup> led to the characterization of the properties of PpL, which is a B-cell superantigen that targets sites on the immunoglobulin light-chain. PpL is a 76–106-kDa protein that contains

in the framework regions of the V<sub>H</sub>- and Vκ-gene segments, respectively. These contact sites are in the variable-region framework sites that have remained unchanged during the evolution of the adaptive immune system and are therefore highly conserved between inherited V-gene segments<sup>4,5</sup>. Superantigens recognize residues common to structurally related sets of V genes, which are by definition the members of the same or related V-gene families. These correlations explain why these superantigen-binding functional sites are highly prevalent in the BCR repertoires of mammalian species and often in more-primitive species. As a direct consequence, a large proportion of the B-cell repertoire exhibits such superantigen-binding activities as they express susceptible V regions, whereas B cells that express unrelated V regions are unaffected. There are

Fc region  
Crystallizable fragment of an  
antibody that includes the  
heavy-chain constant region  
domains responsible for  
effector functions.

4–6 homologous domains that have both α-helical and  
β-pleated sheet portions. Each of these domains can  
interact with a conserved $V_{L}$ framework-region site commonly expressed by products of the human Vk1, Vk3 and  
Vk4 gene families but not with BCRs containing Vk2 or  
λ light chain. PpL can interact with more than half of all  
Vk-expressing human circulating B cells, although a range  
of binding affinities for these different immunoglobulin  
products is exhibited ${}^{14,15}$. *In vivo* interactions with PpL  
induces apoptotic death of Vk-susceptible B cells by the  
same sequence of events as described for SpA ${}^{16}$.

**HIV-1 gp120.** Braun and co-workers first postulated  
that BCR-mediated immunomodulation of large sets of  
B cells occurred during clinical HIV-1 infection ${}^{17}$. These  
biological properties were attributed to gp120, an envelope  
protein that is repetitively arrayed on the surface  
of HIV virions and is found in isolates from different  
clades and from diverse geographical origins ${}^{18}$. Due to  
contacts with a conformational $V_{H}$ framework-region  
site in many BCRs that is similar to, but less common  
than, that recognized by SpA ${}^{19}$, interactions with gp120  
are especially common among the products of two large  
$V_{H} 3$-gene subfamilies ${}^{20}$. Therefore, although a different  
structural strategy has been used by this viral protein,  
both gp120 and SpA target the same or a closely related  
BCR $V_{H} 3$-region site. Perhaps reflecting the prominence  
of the shared $V_{H} 3$-contact site in the human immune  
repertoire, and/or its lack of diversification during  

immune evolution, BCRs sharing this same site are also  
targeted by a 175-kDa human gut-associated sialoprotein,  
termed pFv ${}^{21}$. In fact, SpA and pFv compete for binding  
to the same or overlapping superantigen-binding sites on  
$V_{H} 3$ immunoglobulins ${}^{7}$. The gene encoding pFv has yet  
to be identified.

**Staphylococcal enterotoxin D.** Staphylococcal enterotoxin D (SED), which is best known for its capacity to  
induce TCR-mediated activation of T cells, has been  
reported to function in an *in vitro* system as a $V_{H} 4$-  
restricted B-cell superantigen ${}^{22}$. However, because only  
studies using purified B cells have been reported, it  
is uncertain whether the relatively weak interactions  
described would have a detectable effect in an *in vivo*  
biological setting, in which the more potent T-cell  
modulatory properties of SED might predominate.

**Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1.** The erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (EMP1)  
of *Plasmodium falciparum* contains a cysteine-rich  
interdomain region 1α (CIDR1α) that can interact with  
Fab (and also Fc) regions of antibodies ${}^{23}$. However, it is  
currently unclear whether EMP1 has all of the properties  
of a B-cell superantigen, in particular, whether it  
directly affects V-gene-defined sets of B cells. CIDR1α  
can induce the activation and proliferation of B cells in a  
dose-dependent manner, resulting in the production of  
tumour-necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) ${}^{23}$.

Figure 1 | Superantigens interact with conserved variable  
region sites on antibodies. The general structural and  
genetic principles that underlie antigen recognition by  
an antibody are well known. In general, the binding of an  
antigen involves contacts from both the heavy-chain  
variable region ($V_{H}$) and light-chain variable region ($V_{L}$).  
In each V region there are three non-contiguous linear  
intervals of greatest variability, which have been termed  
hypervariable regions or complementarity-determining  
regions (CDRs). Separating these CDRs are more highly  
conserved intervals termed framework regions. In the  
β-barrel structure of an antibody, the framework regions  
fold into relatively rigid β strands that maintain the overall  
antibody structure, whereas the CDRs form β bends (or  
loops) that are juxtaposed to form a composite surface at  
one end of the Fab to provide the contacts for antigen.  
The recognition of an antigen requires a combinatorial  
interaction of residues from two or more of these loops,  
with contributions that always include the somatically  
generated CDR3 subdomains. By contrast, superantigens  
bind outside this conventional binding site through  
conformational framework sites. Here, the Fab-mediated  
binding interactions of the B-cell superantigens,  
Staphylococcal protein A (SpA) and *Peptostreptococcus magnus* protein L (PpL), are compared with a conventional  
antigen. The heavy chain ($V_{H}$ and constant ($C_{H} 1$)) is cyan and  
the light chain ($V_{L}$ and $C_{L}$) is blue. SpA is shown interacting  
with the framework regions of the heavy chain whereas PpL  
is interacting with the light chain. By contrast, the  
conventional antigen interacts with the CDR loops (pink).

Figure 2 | The in vivo susceptibility of B cells to superantigen exposure and subsequent outcomes. Superantigens can interact with a large proportion of the B-cell compartment. a | The superantigen can interact with all clones of a particular family (green) no matter what their conventional antigen specificity is. The conventional antigen, however, might be able to interact with only certain clones of a defined binding-specificity (brown) and of a particular family (green). b | On initial B-cell exposure to a superantigen, the B-cell receptor (BCR) of all susceptible clones are recruited into complexes that appear as membrane-associated caps. This is followed by the subsequent clustering of the CD21 and CD19 co-receptors and the resulting activation of the B cell, which is associated with early upregulation of CD69 and CD86 expression. Later activation events include the upregulation of CD40, CD54, CD80 and CD95. At early time points, migration of B cells to the spleen is observed. Several outcomes have been shown to follow this exposure, the main one being apoptosis, which is first observed within 4 hours of superantigen exposure. Although some proliferation occurs following superantigen encounter, if an appropriate second signal, such as CD40 ligand or interleukin-4, is delivered, increased proliferation and survival of clones results. Alternative outcomes, such as the induced differentiation of clones into memory cells, functional inactivation (anergy) or receptor editing, have not yet been documented, but based on B-cell responses to conventional antigenic-ligands, these are also possible outcomes after superantigen exposure.

As malaria infection is associated with induction of B-cell proliferation and related cytokine abnormalities, it will be of clinical importance to define the fine specificity of this protein for the BCR and understand whether the pathogenesis of malaria is affected by these properties of EMP1. Whether V-region-directed-binding interactions have central roles in the pathogenesis of malaria would also be of clinical importance.

Superantigen-like proteins. Efforts to define the structural and functional features of B-cell superantigens have focused on Fab-binding proteins that target V-region sites in the BCR. However, there are even more known microbial proteins that bind to antibodies through sites in immunoglobulin constant-region domains, but it is currently uncertain whether these proteins function as B-cell superantigens, especially with regard to the capacity to cause AICD of B cells (see later). For example,

superantigen-like properties might contribute to the pathogenic potential of factors such as IgA-binding proteins that are expressed by microbial pathogens at mucosal surfaces (reviewed in REF. 24). We therefore speculate that the deletion of IgA-expressing B cells could impair defences at these primary barriers to infection. Similarly, although several IgG-binding proteins produced by bacteria (such as Haemophilus somnus²⁵, Fusobacterium nucleatum²⁶, Streptococcus pyogenes²⁷, and groups C and G Streptococci²⁸) have been described, their potential effects on IgG-expressing memory B cells have not yet been considered. Although there is currently no direct evidence that these constant-region-binding proteins can act as supraclonal agents similar to PpL and SpA, they could, nonetheless, have important effects on the B-cell compartment of the host.

Synthetic B-cell superantigens. The immunomodulatory potential of a synthetic B-cell superantigen has been tested in recently reported studies by Nemazee and co-workers²⁹, using mice transgenic for an experimental ‘macro-self antigen’. These mice constitutively express a single-chain antibody specific for the κ-light-chain constant-region that can potentially interact with the antigen receptors of all κ light-chain-expressing B cells. Indeed, they found supraclonal deletion of Vk-expressing B cells during immune development in the bone marrow of these mice²⁹. Such model systems provide opportunities to assess the mechanisms responsible for immune tolerance in systems in which a BCR ligand is introduced. These mice have the advantage that their immunoglobulin gene loci have not been manipulated, as is required for many other transgenic approaches routinely used for the study of B-cell tolerance.

The effects of B-cell superantigens on B cells Encounters of B cells with a B-cell superantigen have been shown to induce proliferation, activation, migration and deletion (FIG. 2).

Proliferation. Since the first discovery of SpA, the idea that Fab-binding proteins have mitogenic properties for B cells has been repeatedly revisited. Romagnani et al. first reported that the Fab-binding activity of SpA was essential for the in vitro mitogenic capacity of certain S. aureus extracts (such as S. aureus Cowans strain, SAC)³⁰. Later studies using simplified culture systems, failed to show that recombinant SpA induced the proliferation of human B cells³¹. This topic was reconsidered following the discovery of the V₃-restriction of the Fab-binding activity of SpA⁸,⁹. Studies showed that SAC-stimulated B cells preferentially expressed V₃-gene transcripts³². Other in vitro investigations have shown that by providing suitable secondary stimulation signals, such as IL-2 and CD3-specific-antibody-activated T cells³³, together with recombinant SpA, the preferential survival of V₃-expressing B cells can be induced. These studies indicated that under appropriate conditions SpA may have an anti-apoptotic effect on V₃-expressing B cells. These reports also show that simplified culture conditions can introduce biases that influence clonal outcomes,

B2 cell  
The main population of mature recirculating B cells, which are the predominant population in the primary follicle. These cells do not express CD5, respond more slowly to antigen than B1 cells, produce antibodies of narrow specificity and depend on MHC-class-II-mediated T-cell help.

Marginal-zone B cell  
Mature B cells resident in the extra-follicular region outside the marginal sinuses of the spleen.

T-cell-independent responses  
An antibody response to polymeric antigens, such as polysaccharides and lipids, that does not require antigen-specific T-cell help.

FTY720  
A sphingosine-like drug that is phosphorylated intracellularly by sphingosine kinase and has immunosuppressive activity through functioning as an antagonist and downregulator of the sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor S1P<sub>1</sub> and other S1P receptors.

Receptor editing  
A molecular process that involves secondary rearrangements of the light chains or heavy chains that replace existing immunoglobulin molecules to generate a new antigen receptor with altered specificity.

Activation. Studies in mice using recombinant SpA have shown that following parenteral administration, this superantigen quickly navigates through the circulation, to engage the BCR of targeted V<sub>H</sub>3-expressing B cells at remote sites throughout the body<sup>34</sup>. The formation of superantigen complexes on B-cell surfaces, which represent oligovalent binding and/or crosslinking interactions between the superantigen and BCRs, is rapidly followed by what appears in cytometric assays to be a downregulation of membrane-associated IgM and IgD on affected B cells. These BCR–SpA complexes recruit co-receptors such as **CD19** and **CD21** (REF. 34), whereas there is no effect on the expression of the B220 isoform of CD45, CD9 or CD93 (also known as ClqR), which have therefore been used to monitor the effects of SpA exposure on specific mature and precursor B-cell subsets<sup>35</sup> (C.S.G. and G.J.S., unpublished observation). B cells targeted by a B-cell superantigen undergo activation, with upregulation of expression of the early activation markers **CD69** and **CD86**, followed later by increased expression of CD40, CD54, CD80 and **CD95** (REF. 34), whereas the neighbouring B cells that do not express susceptible BCRs are unaffected.

Migration. Treatment with a B-cell superantigen also induces the exit of mature B cells from the peripheral lymph nodes and their migration into the spleen. As a direct consequence, for the first few hours after superantigen treatment there is a transient increase in the number of follicular B cells (B2 cells) in the spleen. Within a few hours of superantigen treatment, there is also a redistribution of splenic B cells within the local microarchitecture of the spleen; B cells lining the outside of the marginal sinus (marginal-zone (MZ) B cells) are induced to migrate into the B-cell follicles so that by 6–8 h after exposure, these extra-follicular sites are completely devoid of susceptible B cells<sup>35</sup>.

The changes induced by superantigen exposure are reminiscent of the migration of MZ B cells induced during T-cell-independent responses by conventional antigen encounter. In fact, comparable changes can also be induced by treatment with the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) agonist, endotoxin, or following immune-complex exposure, or treatment with FTY720 (a drug that targets the sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor implicated in the regulation of lymphocyte trafficking)<sup>36–40</sup>.

Supraclonal deletion. During the later stages after the infusion of a B-cell superantigen, there is a massive deposition of B220<sup>+</sup> apoptotic bodies in the spleen and in peripheral lymph nodes, indicating that superantigen exposure ends in apoptosis of a large proportion of affected B cells throughout the body<sup>34,35</sup>. The relative efficiency and kinetics of superantigen-induced supraclonal deletion vary between different types of B cell (TABLE 2). In particular, the earliest wave of death includes MZ B cells, which undergo rapid and efficient cellular deletion that progresses to completion by 16–24 h after treatment<sup>35</sup>. By contrast, following a single dose of superantigen, a lower level of deletion of the follicular B-cell population is induced and this response is slower, only being complete after 72–96 h<sup>34,35</sup>. In part, these differences have been attributed to the lower BCR-signalling thresholds of MZ B cells compared with follicular B cells<sup>41,42</sup> (reviewed in REF. 43) and also the greater accessibility of MZ B cells to blood-borne factors (see later).

Although B cells of all subsets can be deleted by a superantigen (if they express the targeted type of BCR), it remains to be explored whether some B cells escape by receptor editing. Whereas this process might be common after exposure to a V<sub>L</sub>-targeting superantigen, the capacity for conventional V<sub>H</sub> editing is limited by the fact that VDJ assembly on the H-chain locus leads to the loss of D elements (reviewed in REF. 44). However, an

Figure 3 | Superantigen-induced cell death through B-cell receptor engagement. On engagement of a superantigen, the B-cell receptors (BCRs) are recruited into complexes that include CD19, CD21 and other co-receptors, and this results in capping on the B-cell surface. This engagement leads to signalling events for cellular activation that end with the death of the B cell between several hours and several days. These interactions cause a series of intracellular events that remain unclear, which lead to changes in mitochondrial membrane potential and ultimately to the release of cytochrome c and pro-apoptotic factors. This results in the release of active caspase-9, which activates caspase-3 that is responsible for downstream DNA fragmentation and nuclear fragmentation. Although the signals between the BCR and the mitochondria still need to be identified, recent studies indicate that BCR-induced cell death recruits pro-death BCL-2-homology domain 3-only (BH3-only) B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) family members (C.S.G. and G.J.S., unpublished observations). This induction might occur either through post-transcriptional pathways such as the release of active BH3-only protein from sequestration at sites such as the dynein motor complex or through transcriptional regulation.

B1 cells (B1a and B1b)
The minority population of mature B cells that are a major source of constitutively expressed IgM. The B1a cells express CD5, whereas the B1b cells do not, and together these B1 cells generally respond quickly to antigen to produce antibodies of broad specificity and do not require MHC-class-II-mediated T-cell help.

The findings described earlier have been obtained from studies using mice expressing BCR with a mouse analogue V<sub>H</sub>3-expressing-rearrangement knock-in (the V<sub>H</sub>-gene rearrangement is genetically inserted at the germline V<sub>H</sub> locus), termed T15i<sup>34,35,45</sup>. Mice with polyclonal B-cell repertoires that contain both susceptible and non-susceptible clones, in which the entire B-cell pool is not completely deleted by superantigen encounter with superantigen might still induce receptor editing by V<sub>H</sub>-gene replacement, although we have not found evidence of this mechanism after a single treatment with 1 mg of SpA (G.J.S. and C.S.G., unpublished observation).

Mechanisms of B-cell deletion by superantigens
In vivo studies have shown that the apoptosis induced by both V<sub>H</sub>- and V<sub>L</sub>-targeting B-cell superantigens follows a defined sequence of events<sup>16,34</sup>, which is initiated by BCR crosslinking and co-modulation of other B-cell

treatment, were also used to obtain these findings. These studies showed that the different types of splenic B cell vary in the rate at which they recover following superantigen-induced deletion<sup>30</sup>. The induced loss of BCR-susceptible B cells in the MZ (creating a ‘hole’ in the MZ B-cell pool) persists for a prolonged period, with recovery occurring at a slower rate (with a half life (t<sub>1/2</sub>) of 21 weeks) compared with B2 cells (t<sub>1/2</sub> of 13 weeks). So, during the post-treatment phase, superantigen-reactive B-cell clones — either newly generated from proliferating B-cell precursors or derived from other types of peripheral B cell — seemed to be delayed in their entry into the MZ B-cell compartment. By comparison, the supractonal defect induced by superantigen was more rapidly ‘healed’ to regain the full diversity of the associated BCR repertoire in the B2-cell clones of the primary follicle. These findings are also compatible with studies of mice engineered to have an inducible downregulation of antibody gene recombination (so that new B cells can no longer be generated in the bone marrow), as in these mice the MZ B cells were shown to have a much slower decay rate than the B2 cells<sup>46</sup>. Together, these studies indicate that there are important differences in the homeostatic factors affecting these different types of splenic B cell. However, it remains possible that the documented delay in recovery from superantigen exposure by MZ B cells could also in part reflect the possible local persistence of immune complexes that contain superantigen and complement at MZ sites (just as conventional antigen is retained by follicular dendritic cells)<sup>47–50</sup>.

It has not yet been definitively determined that B1 cells are as susceptible as B2 cells to single-treatment doses of superantigen. Nonetheless, following B-cell superantigen exposure there is a profound BCR-targeted loss of peritoneal B1 cells<sup>45</sup>, with comparable losses in the number of splenic IgM-secreting cells<sup>51</sup>. Moreover, the effect of superantigen exposure on these innate-like B cells can be long-lasting, as it was found that the targeted ‘hole’ in the B1-cell pool had not resolved (or healed) more than a year after SpA exposure<sup>45</sup>. This persistent loss seems to reflect the unique biology of B1a cells, as the generation of the full repertoire of these B cells in mice is reported to be complete by ~4 weeks of life and thereafter these B cells are self-replenishing without further contribution from the bone marrow<sup>52–56</sup>. Therefore, whereas the adult bone marrow can reconstitute the full set of peripheral follicular B cells (B2 cells), the impairment of the repertoire of B1a cells induced by B-cell superantigen may not be repairable. B1b cells are also induced by B-cell superantigen to undergo lasting deletion<sup>45</sup>, although the capacity to replace these clones is currently less well understood. Therefore, the B-cell subsets that provide the primary defence against blood-borne pathogens (that is, MZ and B1 cells) are more vulnerable to microbial superantigens<sup>35,45</sup> (reviewed in REF. 57).
co-receptors<sup>34</sup>, and results in BCR internalization following tyrosine phosphorylation<sup>58</sup>. It remains to be clarified whether interactions with a superantigen yields special capabilities to the BCR signalosome<sup>59</sup>, such as changes in the efficiency of translocation into lipid rafts and the quality and/or strength of downstream signalling, which are responsible for the bias in pro-death clonal fates.

Following BCR encounter with superantigen, there is a time period associated with a shift in mitochondrial membrane potential. This period has been termed the decision phase, as it can lead to cell death, but if a suitable second signal such as CD40 ligand (CD40L) or IL-4 is present, the affected B cells can have increased survival rates and undergo massive proliferation<sup>60</sup>. In fact, adoptive-transfer studies have shown that superantigen exposure is always followed by a detectable level of B-cell proliferation, which may vary based on the dose and availability of second signals, as discussed later<sup>29,30</sup>.

The apoptotic pathway induced by these superantigens therefore seems to begin with events that disrupt the mitochondrial membrane potential and potentially lead to the release of cytochrome *c* (FIG. 3). This triggers the activation of caspase-9, followed by the induction of the effector caspases, caspase-3 and caspase-7, which are involved in the 'executioner phase'<sup>61</sup>. Supporting the idea that the primary upstream apoptotic event involves the mitochondria, the incubation of affected B cells with a pan-caspase inhibitor does not prevent this apoptotic fate, although the rate of progression is slowed, presumably due to the absence of the amplifying downstream caspases<sup>34</sup>. Also consistent with the involvement of mitochondria, the overall efficiency and kinetics of superantigen-induced apoptosis can at least be partially blocked by overexpression of the anti-apoptotic protein B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2), which is known to stabilize mitochondrial membrane potential<sup>29</sup>. Moreover, the response of B cells to superantigen exposure is not altered by deficiency in the membrane-associated death receptors, CD95 (also known as FAS)<sup>34</sup> or TNF receptor 1 (C.S.G. and G.J.S., unpublished observations), which trigger the extrinsic death-receptor pathways. Therefore, the cumulative evidence indicates that B-cell superantigen induces apoptosis by the release of death factors from the mitochondria and this has been termed the intrinsic pathway<sup>34</sup>.

**BCR signalosome**

The complex of the antigen receptor and associated co-receptors that is responsible for antigen-mediated signalling.

**Mitochondrial membrane potential**

A membrane potential change that shows the integrity of the mitochondrial membrane is disturbed, and this can progress to overt disruption. If this occurs, the release of mitochondrial factors that include cytochrome *c* and activated caspases rapidly activates the executioner phase of apoptosis.

**Intrinsic pathway of cell death**

Pathways of apoptosis that are not initiated through membrane-associated death receptors, but are dependent on mitochondrial release of oxidatively active and proteolytic factors.

**Hapten**

Minimal molecular determinant that can be bound by an antibody but cannot by itself elicit an immune response. Antibodies that are specific for a hapten can be generated when the hapten is chemically linked to a protein carrier that is able to elicit a T-cell response.

shifts in the balance of pro-survival members of the BCL-2 family, and the induction of pro-death BH3 (BCL-2-homology domain 3)-only family members, to induce death through BCL-2 antagonist/killer (BAK) and BAX (BCL-2-associated X protein).

We, therefore, postulate that encounters with a B-cell superantigen commonly lead to AICD and that this is due to the delivery of a BCR signal that results in enhanced cellular requirements for cytokine or cognate help (such as IL-4 or CD40L), which are required for survival and/or cell-cycle progression. At the same time, in part because exposure effects a great proportion of B cells<sup>16,34</sup>, this leads to enhanced cellular competition and local consumption of essential factors and together these potent stress stimuli direct superantigen-targeted lymphocytes to apoptotic death.

Our model is also supported by recent findings<sup>66</sup> indicating that larger superantigen doses induce only limited proliferation with more rapid and larger scale death; whereas much smaller doses yield greater supractonal expansion and proliferation that only much later collapse, presumably due to the slower exhaustion of available pro-survival secondary signals<sup>66</sup>. This model also predicts that in a setting of supraphysiological levels of secondary signals, as might occur in a pro-inflammatory environment associated with infection or autoimmune disease, B-cell superantigen might instead induce marked supractonal expansions. However, this supractonal expansion might not be identified without assays using appropriate V-region clonotypic BCR markers. Therefore, the clonal outcome of B-cell superantigen exposure may be largely determined by the *in vivo* influence of cytokine and/or cognate help from bystander leukocytes.

### B-cell superantigens and immune responsiveness

B-cell superantigen exposure has been shown to cause defects in functional immune responsiveness. For the hapten-specific T-cell-independent responses that depend on the recruitment of MZ B cells (such as those to trinitrophenyl (TNP)–lipopolysaccharide and TNP-Ficoll) previous SpA exposure was shown to significantly ablate the TNP-specific antibody response that derives from $V_{\mathrm{H}}$ 3-analogue-expressing B cells (more than 15% of the response)<sup>35</sup>. By contrast, responses from non-$V_{\mathrm{H}}$-susceptible B cells were not compromised<sup>35</sup>.

Previous SpA exposure has also been shown to affect responses to phosphorylcholine-containing immunogens, which are known to be dominated by the B1a cell clone T15, that expresses a $V_{\mathrm{H}}$ 3-related gene product that conveys SpA susceptibility<sup>45</sup>. Moreover, SpA treatment efficiently deletes T15 clonotypic B cells and greatly attenuates subsequent antibody responses to the immunodominant phosphorylcholine moiety in pneumococcal cell wall polysaccharide, which is a natural T-cell-independent type-2 immunogen<sup>45</sup>. Furthermore, a single exposure to SpA can result in a permanent decrease in the levels of all circulating $V_{\mathrm{H}}$-containing IgM antibodies with SpA-binding activity<sup>67</sup>. This decrease results from the deletion of the B1 cells, which are known to be the main source of IgM<sup>53,68,69</sup>. Therefore, the earlier described preferential effects on distinct sets of mature B cells — the more rapid

### Emerging perspectives on activation-induced cell death

The mechanism of apoptosis induced by a B-cell superantigen has all of the phenotypic features, such as the induction of the expression of activation markers and mitochondrial changes, of what was originally termed AICD. AICD is a process that was first described in cell lines undergoing induced death in culture<sup>62</sup> and was earlier ascribed to CD95 or other membrane-associated death receptors<sup>63</sup>. However, just as the relevance of a death-receptor pathway has recently been challenged for *in vivo* T-cell systems<sup>64</sup>, it also does not seem to contribute to B-cell superantigen-induced death. Available data are more consistent with the hypothesis of Strasser and co-workers<sup>65</sup> who propose that certain stress stimuli, such as the exhaustion of growth factors, can induce cell death by a mitochondrial pathway that depends on
deletion and longer lasting defect of MZ B cells compared with B2 cells, and the permanent loss of deleted Bla cells — correlate with the relative functional impairments of responses that derive from these B-cell subsets.

The response to neonatal exposure to superantigen was also examined using a chemically modified (iodinated) form of SpA that is devoid of Fcγ-binding activity<sup>67</sup>. These studies provided the first demonstration of the *in vivo* induction of long-lasting functional impairments of $V_{H}3$-expressing B cells by superantigen and the studies also showed the capacity of superantigen to induce specific T-cell tolerance. However, we later questioned the greater biological relevance of studying such an unnatural protein variant. The affinity and/or avidity of the $V_{H}$-restricted Fab-binding activity of this form of SpA was significantly reduced (by 5-fold) as an unintended and unavoidable by-product of this chemical modification, which also decreased its efficiency to induce deletion of targeted B cells<sup>45</sup>. Viau *et al.*<sup>70</sup> recently described the response to treatment with iodinated SpA of mice transgenic for a human $V_{H}$ loci, which includes $V_{H}3$ genes that express the same evolutionarily conserved SpA-binding site that is expressed in the T15i $V_{H}$-knock-in mice<sup>34,35,45</sup> (described earlier). These findings confirmed the key findings reported earlier regarding the specific susceptibilities of Bl and MZ B cells, whereas the minor differences observed are probably explained by the lower affinity of the iodinated SpA used and intrinsic differences in model mouse systems.

Taken together, these findings indicate that a microbial pathogen, such as *S. aureus*, may derive an advantage from producing a B-cell superantigen that can induce prolonged impairments of Bl and MZ B cells, which have important roles in host immune defences against blood-borne pathogens (discussed in REF. 57). However, the full range of the effects of superantigens on other B-cell functions, which include antigen presentation, cytokine production and the maintenance of immune memory has not yet been examined. Moreover, as most studies of B-cell superantigens have used purified proteins, the outcomes may be different during the course of an infection when other immunologically active microbial factors are present, as discussed later.

**Potential roles in the pathogenesis of infection**

HIV. Our models of *in vivo* responses to superantigens were predated (and perhaps predicted) by pioneering studies from Braun and co-workers<sup>17</sup> of clinical HIV-1 infection that postulated the influence of a $V_{H}3$-targeting B-cell superantigen (as mentioned earlier). Although limited to serological analysis, large epidemiological surveys showed that during early HIV-1 infection in many patients there were preferential increases in $V_{H}3$-containing immunoglobulin levels, whereas these levels later decreased as the disease progressed<sup>17,71</sup>. These findings were interpreted as evidence of early superantigen-mediated activation and proliferation of targeted B cells that were later deleted with disease progression. Consistent with this interpretation, surveys of B-cell clones producing antibodies specific for HIV-1 gp120 and p24 that were isolated from patients with end-stage AIDS showed preferential representation of $V_{H}1$ and $V_{H}4$ families and a paucity of $V_{H}3$ members. A more recent study has confirmed that HIV-1 infection also effects the $V_{H}3$- gene repertoire of circulating IgM and also $V_{H}3$ IgG transcripts in circulating B cells<sup>72</sup>. Taken together, studies in patients with HIV led to the first formulation of the hypothesis that the influence of a B-cell superantigen may leave a functional ‘hole’ in the repertoire of B cells that are available to be recruited into protective responses<sup>73</sup>. Supporting this hypothesis, individuals infected with HIV are reported to have impaired $V_{H}3$-containing IgG responses to pneumococcal vaccination compared with individuals not infected with HIV<sup>74</sup>. Individuals infected with HIV are also well known to be prone to overwhelming pneumococcal sepsis, which may be due to this induced B-cell defect<sup>75</sup>. This susceptibility can be reversed by effective antiretroviral treatments<sup>76</sup>, possibly because the induced B-cell defect resolves.

Immunochemical analyses have confirmed that certain HIV gp120 isolates, and synthetic peptides generated from their coding sequences, are recognized by antibodies restricted to two large subfamilies of $V_{H}3$ genes. These types of binding interaction have been described as non-immune, as reactivity (or the magnitude of the response) is not substantially affected by previous immune exposure. However, it should be acknowledged that as infection is associated with many other induced defects in B-cell function, ranging from inhibition of chemotaxis to dysregulated CD62L expression and documented increases in CD95-mediated B-cell apoptosis<sup>77</sup>, other cellular and cytokine-mediated mechanisms may instead explain the humoral abnormalities in these patients. In any case, with the introduction of effective antiretroviral therapeutic agents, it has been difficult to extend these early observations.

Staphylococci. The pathogenesis of serious staphylococcal infections is complex. The virulence of a strain of *Staphylococci* is potentially affected by the presence of many active factors, including various exotoxins with pro-inflammatory and/or immunostimulatory properties, that contribute to the severity of the infection, and also by adhesins that are postulated to mediate bacterial attachment to host tissues<sup>78</sup>. This common pathogen and its products have several mechanisms to interfere with the host’s capacity to mount the specific immune responses needed for protection against subsequent infection. Notably, infection studies in mice have shown that SpA acts as a virulence factor for subcutaneous infections and septic arthritis, and contributes to increased mortality in a peritonitis model<sup>79,80</sup>.

Superantigen expression during staphylococcal infection could also contribute to clinical and pathological events by affecting cells other than B cells. For example, from *in vitro* studies, gp120, PpL, pFv and SpA have all been shown to trigger basophils and mast cells through antibodies arrayed on their membrane-associated Fc receptors<sup>81–83</sup>. These interactions can have various biological effects; including hypersensitivity reactions, the release of histamine from basophils, the de-repression of the opsonizing activity of serum and impaired phagocytosis<sup>81–83</sup>. Interactions with soluble immunoglobulin

can also activate complement<sup>84</sup>. Passive-transfer studies in rabbits have shown that interactions between SpA and V<sub>H</sub>3-containing IgG at subcutaneous sites can result in an immune-complex disease that emulates the features of the Arthus reaction<sup>85</sup>. During S. aureus infection, different clonal and immunological outcomes from superantigen exposure could result from the release of other immunologically active microbial products, such as peptidoglycans or even T-cell superantigens such as staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB), which could act as adjuvants or induce the secondary signals that result in supractonal expansions. In addition, current rodent models may not be optimal for understanding the immunomodulatory properties of staphylococcal infection. For example, the innate immune system of mice is especially effective at containing and eradicating staphylococci, which hampers studies of how infection-associated SpA production may affect the B-cell compartment.

Despite these potential limitations, in a recent report, the influence of the superantigen properties of SpA was evaluated during active infection based on comparisons between the SpA-producing S. aureus 8325-4 strain and an isogenic SpA-deficient mutant created by allelic replacement<sup>86</sup>. Reiterating patterns that were previously found in infection with HIV-1, primary infection with a modest inoculum of SpA-expressing staphylococci gave rise to significantly higher serum levels of V<sub>H</sub>3-containing antibodies compared with the isogenic SpA deletion mutant strain. By contrast, a larger staphylococcal inoculum correlated with a significantly impaired capacity to make V<sub>H</sub>3-containing antibody responses<sup>86</sup>. These findings, therefore, confirmed that SpA expression during staphylococcal infection can modulate recruited SpA-reactive B-cell clones through V<sub>H</sub>3-dependent mechanisms that induce either supractonal expansion or deletion. Although analyses failed to detect a subversive effect on host IgG responses to clumping factor A (an immunogenic

staphylococcal protein moiety in S. aureus<sup>86</sup>), the superantigenic influence of SpA has been shown to be more effective at impairing T-cell-independent responses to non-protein antigens<sup>35,45</sup>. This topic will merit further examination in the future.

How can the expression of a B-cell superantigen benefit a microbial pathogen? Survival from an infection may depend directly on the capacity of the host to limit and localize an infection before the pathogen proliferates and spreads, and antibody responses are often key factors in such defences. V<sub>H</sub>3 genes are commonly and often preferentially expressed during antibody responses to conserved bacterial determinants such as the capsular polysaccharides of Haemophilus influenzae type b<sup>87</sup>, and also pneumococcal capsular type-specific polysaccharides<sup>88,89</sup>. In fact, some V<sub>H</sub>3 genes may have been selected during evolution for their use in antimicrobial responses, particularly those from innate-like B cells. Therefore, we speculate that superantigens may have developed as a pre-emptive strike mechanism for the microorganism to specifically target those B cells that are most essential for host defence (discussed in REF. 57). Although it remains uncertain which conventional staphylococcal antigens are the most important antigens for host immune recognition, clones from the B1- and/or MZ B-cell pools are probably important for these defences. In support of this, immunization with a non-protein staphylococcal adhesin, poly N-acetylglucosamine, can induce protective immune responses in mice, whereas immunization with whole staphylococcal bacteria does not<sup>90</sup>. We speculate that the SpA in staphylococcal extracts could contribute to the finding that such immunogens do not induce protective immune responses to later infection. This virulence mechanism may also partly explain why a clinically effective staphylococcal vaccine has not yet been developed.

### Concluding remarks

The study of B-cell superantigens offers opportunities to better understand how BCR interactions (which evolved for physiological immunoregulation of clonal responses for immune protection) can result in supractonal dysregulation and induce tolerance that subverts host defences. Future studies are needed to better define the nature of the BCR co-complex, and assess how the presence or absence of secondary signals and differences in intracellular signalling lead to either negative or positive lymphocyte selection.

Natural B-cell superantigens may also provide a new therapeutic approach. MZ B cells, which have been shown to be especially susceptible to SpA-induced deletion<sup>35</sup>, have been implicated in recent studies as sources of pathogenic autoantibodies in autoimmune diseases<sup>91</sup>. In fact, although the therapy they receive was not intentionally designed for this purpose, patients with autoimmune diseases may already be benefiting from the immunomodulatory activity of SpA<sup>92</sup>. Each time a patient is treated with one type of a Food-and-Drug-Administration-approved apheresis column, which consists of SpA on an inert silica base, an SpA dose leaches off the column and is infused into the patient<sup>92</sup>; equivalent doses in mice, even for 2 μg

**Box 2 | Altering autoantigens to function as superantigens**

The successful generation of synthetic superantigens or superantigens with enhanced properties relies on the incorporation of structure–function relationships that have been identified in studies of natural superantigens that have defined the requirements for B-cell clonal deletion. To be a superantigen, an agent should be oligovalent or multivalent, and have the capacity to interact with the B-cell receptor (BCR) of a specific set of clones, without blockade by circulating immunoglobulin. Recent studies have shown ways to emulate superantigen-binding interactions. In one study, a single-chain variable (V) domain antibody fragment (scFv) was generated that competed with Staphylococcal protein A (SpA) for the binding of immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable region 3- (V<sub>H</sub>3) expressing B cells<sup>99</sup>. This synthetic B-cell-targeting agent had a smaller footprint for contacting the framework regions associated with V<sub>H</sub>3 binding and was able to interact with a larger set of mouse V<sub>H</sub>3-expressing B cells than SpA could. Although it remains to be tested directly, this scFv should act as a superantigen if made into a multimer. Other work has looked at the use of altering the binding interactions of a known superantigen to increase its affinity for immunoglobulin<sup>100,101</sup>. However, these studies have not shown whether these new forms had increased or altered superantigen capabilities. Finally, Ait-Azzouzene et al. have reported a transgenic mouse in which expression of an scFv specific for constant (C)κ in some ways emulates the properties of a B-cell superantigen<sup>29</sup> to alter the representation of clones in the B-cell repertoire. More work needs to be done to understand the potential properties of such synthetic superantigens and whether autoantigens themselves could be engineered to have similar properties.

has proven efficacy in several autoimmune diseases,  
superantigen-based therapeutic approaches may be  
attractive for the treatment of B-cell-driven autoimmune  
diseases and also for B-cell neoplastic diseases, such as  
lymphoma or leukaemia.

In more general terms, there is a wide range of  
diseases that directly reflect the dysregulated clonal  
expansion and uncontrolled production of auto-  
antibodies and anti-allotypic responses. From dia-  
betes mellitus, to blood-group incompatibility and  
multiple sclerosis, there are many patients who are  
likely to benefit from B-cell depletion. In the future,  
therapeutic agents could also be developed in which  
variant forms of the self-antigen are generated and  
administered in forms that would specifically delete  
the pathological B-cell clone that is responsible for the  
relevant disease (BOX 2). From a better understanding
