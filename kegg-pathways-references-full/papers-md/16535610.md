Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes JS52 grows on nitrobenzene via partial reduction of the nitro group and enzymatic rearrangement of the resultant hydroxylamine. Cells and cell extracts of nitrobenzene-grown JS52 catalyzed the transient formation of 4-hydroxylamino-2,6-dinitrotoluene (4HADNT), 4-amino-2,6-dinitrotoluene (4ADNT), and four previously unidentified metabolites from 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT). Two of the novel metabolites were identified by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry and ¹H-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy as 2,4-dihydroxylamino-6-nitrotoluene (DHANT) and 2-hydroxylamino-4-amino-6-nitrotoluene (2HA4ANT). A polar yellow metabolite also accumulated during transformation of TNT by cells and cell extracts. Under anaerobic conditions, extracts of strain JS52 did not catalyze the production of the yellow metabolite or release nitrite from TNT; moreover, DHANT and 2HA4ANT accumulated under anaerobic conditions, which indicated that their further metabolism was oxygen dependent. Small amounts of nitrite were released during transformation of TNT by strain JS52. Sustained transformation of TNT by cells required nitrobenzene, which indicated that TNT transformation does not provide energy. Transformation of TNT catalyzed by enzymes in cell extracts required NADPH. Transformation experiments with ¹⁴C-TNT indicated that TNT was not mineralized; however, carbon derived from TNT became associated with cells. Nitrobenzene nitroreductase purified from strain JS52 transformed TNT to DHANT via 4HADNT, which indicated that the nitroreductase could catalyze the first two steps in the transformation of TNT. The unusual ability of the nitrobenzene nitroreductase to catalyze the stoichiometric reduction of aromatic nitro compounds to the corresponding hydroxylamine provides the basis for the novel pathway for metabolism of TNT.

2,4,6-Trinitrotoluene (TNT) has been used extensively as an explosive since 1902 (22). Accidental release of TNT has contaminated groundwater and soil at numerous munition manufacturing sites. TNT is toxic to algae and invertebrates (43), and chronic exposure to TNT causes adverse health effects in humans (20). The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has listed TNT as a priority pollutant and has recommended that it be removed from contaminated sites. Although several reports have described bacteria capable of growing on TNT as a carbon source (12, 15, 22), most of the evidence indicates that bacteria convert TNT to amino derivatives that accumulate (6, 13, 27).

To date, the reported pathways for biological reduction of TNT have been the same as for chemical reduction. The nitro groups are reduced to the corresponding amines via nitroso and hydroxylamino intermediates. Reduction of the second nitro group does not begin until the first nitro group has been converted to the amine. Most bacteria studied to date catalyze the preferential reduction of the 4-nitro group to yield 4-amino-2,6-dinitrotoluene (4ADNT) (Fig. 1) (3–5, 11, 23, 27, 34). Reduction of TNT to 4ADNT is catalyzed by nonspecific reductases (8, 9) and involves the intermediate formation of nitroso and hydroxylamino intermediates. 4ADNT is subsequently reduced to 2,4-diamino-6-nitrotoluene (24DANT) under anaerobic conditions, and Knackmuss and Rieger (34) have suggested that 2-hydroxylamino-4-amino-6-nitrotoluene (2HA4ANT) is an intermediate. Recently it has been suggested (34) that dihydroxylamino compounds such as 2,4-dihydroxylamino-6-nitrotoluene (DHANT) could theoretically be intermediates in biological reduction pathways. The tentative identification of 2,6-dihydroxylamino-4-nitrotoluene in culture fluids of a Pseudomonas strain grown on TNT lends support to the hypothesis (12). In addition, Lewis et al. (24) have detected DHANT and 2HA4ANT in culture fluids of Clostridium bifermentans incubated with TNT.

Recent studies have shown that reduced TNT metabolites can be further metabolized (34). For example, a Pseudomonas strain transforms radiolabeled 2- and 4-aminodinitrotoluenes to polar metabolites by an oxygen-dependent mechanism (1). A variety of other bacterial enzymes catalyze reactions that transform reduced TNT metabolites; these include oxidation of 4ADNT to 4-amino-2,6-dinitrobenzoic acid (41), addition of a methoxy group to 2,4DANT resulting in the formation of 2,4-diamino-6-nitrobenzyl methyl ether (41), and acetylation of 24DANT to 4-N-acetylamo-2-amino-6-nitrotoluene (14).

The aromatic ring of TNT can also be reduced by microorganisms. Vorbeck et al. (42) reported that a hydride addition reaction resulted in the formation of a TNT H⁻-Meisenheimer complex and subsequent release of nitrite. This reaction was postulated to be involved in the formation of mono- and dinitrotoluenes during TNT metabolism by a Pseudomonas strain (12).

Anaerobic conditions are required for the complete reduction of TNT to 2,4,6-triaminotoluene (TAT) (3, 27, 32). TAT is subsequently converted to several unidentified metabolites (32, 34). Funk et al. reported that TNT is converted to 2,4,6-trihydroxytoluene and 4-hydroxytoluene under anaerobic conditions by a bacterial consortium (13). The mass balance and complete pathway details have yet to be determined. The observation that TAT is converted to nitrogen-free products (13) suggests that complete reduction of TNT under anaerobic conditions is a productive step towards mineralization of TNT.

Moreover, soil leachate from an anaerobic TNT compost system was less toxic than similar aerated compost systems, thus indicating the potential importance of the anaerobic reductive pathway (6) for detoxification.

Recently, bacteria able to use mono- and dinitroaromatic compounds as growth substrates have been studied (16–19, 38). The most common catabolic pathways involve the initial removal of nitro groups catalyzed by oxygenase enzymes (18, 19, 38). Another strategy involves the partial reduction of the nitro groups to hydroxylamino derivatives that are converted to ring fission substrates able to support the growth of the organism (16, 17, 30). Whereas the transformation of TNT by complete sequential reduction has been studied extensively, metabolism by bacteria that catalyze partial reduction of the nitro groups has not been investigated. Studies with such bacteria could answer the question of whether the reduction of TNT must follow the sequential pathway (Fig. 1) or whether partial reduction of multiple nitro groups is possible.

*Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes* JS52 is derived from strain JS45, which uses nitrobenzene as its sole source of carbon, energy, and nitrogen (30). The initial step in the nitrobenzene pathway is catalyzed by nitrobenzene nitroreductase, an NADPH-dependent oxygen-insensitive enzyme that converts nitrobenzene to hydroxylaminobenzene (36). We report here that the enzymes involved in nitrobenzene degradation can also transform TNT via a novel pathway involving DHANT.

### MATERIALS AND METHODS

#### Chemicals
TNT, 4ADNT, 24DANT, and 2ADNT were a generous gift from R. J. Spanggord, SRI, Palo Alto, Calif. 4-Hydroxylamino-2,6-dinitrotoluene (4HADNT) was synthesized anaerobically by incubating 1 ml of an ethanol solution containing TNT (50 mM), NH₄Cl (112 mg) and Zn (152.5 mg) for 48 h (40). The 4HADNT was purified by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (isocratic gradient of 60/40 CH₃CN/H₂O at 1.5 ml/min) by using a semi-prep Zorbax octyldecyl silane column (Dupont, Wilmington, Del.). The purity of 4HADNT was verified by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) using a solvent system of hexane-ethylacetate (1:1 [vol/vol]) (28). NADPH, glucose-6 phosphate, and glucose-6 phosphate dehydrogenase were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim Biochemicals (Indianapolis, Ind.). Uniformly ring-labeled ¹⁴C-TNT (21.58 mCi/mmol) was purchased from Chemsyn Science Labs, Lenexa, Kans., and was purified by TLC and HPLC to greater than 99% radiochemical purity as measured by HPLC.

#### Bacteria and culture conditions
*P. pseudoalcaligenes* JS52 is a spontaneous mutant derived from strain JS45 (30). Both strains grow on nitrobenzene as a sole source of carbon, nitrogen, and energy. In contrast to strain JS45, strain JS52 produces a faint yellow color in the medium during the initial stages of growth on nitrobenzene. The pathway used for degradation of nitrobenzene is identical to the pathway used by the parent strain. Preliminary evidence (35a) suggests that the initial nitroreductase synthesized by strain JS52 contains only a single molecule of flavin and the reaction mechanism allows for the transient accumulation of nitrosobenzene.

#### Preparation of nitrobenzene nitroreductase from strain JS52
Extracts were prepared from cells of *P. pseudoalcaligenes* JS52 as previously described (30, 36). Cells were grown with nitrobenzene as previously described for strain JS45 (30) and washed with 50 mM morpholinepropane sulfonic acid (MOPS) (pH 7.4) containing 10% glycerol–0.1 mM Fe(II)SO₄–2 mM ascorbate (MGA) prior to lysis in the same buffer.

For partially purified preparations JS52 cell extract was subjected to ammonium sulfate precipitation (45% [wt/vol]). The mixture was centrifuged at 5,000 × g for 30 min. The pellet was discarded and the supernatant was desalted by passage through a PD-10 column (12 by 1 cm) with MGA. The partially purified protein was stored on ice until used. Nitrobenzene nitroreductase purified by the method previously described (36) was provided by Charles C. Somerville.

#### Preparation of DHANT and 2HA4ANT
DHANT was produced enzymatically by incubation of partially purified nitrobenzene nitroreductase (50 mg) in 200 ml of potassium phosphate (20 mM, pH 7.5) containing TNT (220 μM), NADPH (100 μM), glucose-6 phosphate (1.5 mM), and 40 U of glucose-6 phosphate dehydrogenase. The reaction mixture was incubated at 25°C for 1 h with gentle stirring prior to extraction with two 100-ml volumes of ethyl acetate. The ethyl acetate was removed by flash evaporation, and the sample was stored at –20°C until used. The synthesis of 2HA4ANT was identical to that of DHANT except that 4ADNT (200 μM) was used as the substrate. Conversion was stoichiometric, and purity was greater than 95% as determined by HPLC analysis.

#### TNT, DHANT, and 2HA4ANT transformation by JS52 cell extracts
Reaction mixtures contained JS52 cell extract (680 μg of protein), potassium phosphate buffer (20 mM, pH 7.5), and TNT, DHANT, or 2HA4ANT (220 μM) in a final volume of 2 ml. Some reaction mixtures contained NADPH (100 μM) with or without glucose-6 phosphate (1 mM) and glucose-6 phosphate dehydrogenase (0.35 U/ml). Cell extract was added to reaction mixtures, and at appropriate time intervals samples (300 μl) were removed, mixed with 150 μl of acetonitrile, and analyzed by HPLC. Anaerobic experiments were done in sealed 25-ml Wheaton serum bottles. Argon gas was bubbled through the reaction mixtures for 15 min prior to the addition of cell extracts. Samples (100 μl) from anaerobic reaction mixtures were injected directly onto the HPLC.

Error bars are the range of duplicate experiments. Compounds were quantitated by HPLC comparison to standards, with the exception of compound I.

buffer (20 mM, pH 7.5) containing nitrobenzene ($1 \mathrm{mM}$), TNT ($220 \mu \mathrm{M}$) and ${ }^{14} \mathrm{C}-\mathrm{TNT}(0.027 \mu \mathrm{Ci} / \mathrm{ml})$ in a $25-\mathrm{ml}$ Wheaton serum bottle. Cold trichloroacetic acid (2% final concentration) was added to precipitate protein at the end of the incubation period. Some of the reaction bottles contained a piece of filter paper saturated with $2 \mathrm{~N} \mathrm{NaOH}$ in a plastic well above the reaction mixture to capture evolved $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$. At the end of the incubation $150 \mu \mathrm{l}$ of $1 \mathrm{~N} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4}$ was added to reaction bottles containing the $\mathrm{NaOH}$-saturated filter paper. After $10 \mathrm{~min}$ of shaking, the filter paper was placed in Ecolume (ICN Biomedical, Inc.) scintillation cocktail and radioactivity was measured in a liquid scintillation counter (Beckman, model LS3801). Samples of the culture fluid were diluted with equal volumes of $\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{CN}$, and the radioactive products were separated by HPLC. Similar experiments were conducted with extracts prepared from nitrobenzene-grown cells of strain JS52.

Analytical methods. Nitrobenzene, TNT, 4HADNT, and 4ADNT were identified and quantitated by HPLC comparison of their retention times and spectra with standards. HPLC analyses were performed with a Spherisorb C$_{8}$ column (Alltech, Deerfield, Ill.) and a linear gradient of acetonitrile and water (1 ml/min). The mobile phase was changed from $40 \%$ acetonitrile/$60 \%$ water to $60 \%$ acetonitrile/$40 \%$ water over $8 \mathrm{~min}$, followed by $2 \mathrm{~min}$ at $60 \%$ acetonitrile/$40 \%$ water. Both the acetonitrile and water contained trifluoroacetic acid ($13.2 \mathrm{mM}$). Some HPLC analyses were performed with acetonitrile and water containing $10 \mathrm{mM}$ ammonium acetate. Compounds were detected by their UV $A_{230}$ with a diode array detector (Hewlett-Packard Corp., Palo Alto, Calif.).

Unknown compounds were separated on silica gel TLC plates (using a 50/50 mixture of ethyl acetate/hexane); amino groups were detected by spraying the plate with $\mathrm{NaNO}_{2}(0.1 \%[\mathrm{wt} / \mathrm{vol}]$ solution in $1 \mathrm{~N} \mathrm{HCl})$, followed by $N$-1-naphthylethylenediamine HCl ($0.04 \%[\mathrm{wt} / \mathrm{vol}]$ solution prepared in methanol) (39).

4HADNT, 24DANT, and 2-amino-4,6-dinitrotoluene (2ADNT) were used as positive controls.

DHANT and 2HA4ANT were chemically reduced to 2,4-diamino-6-nitrotoluene after $15 \mathrm{~min}$ of incubation at $40^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ in freshly prepared potassium phosphate buffer ($20 \mathrm{mM}, \mathrm{pH} 9.0$) containing $\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{~S}(5 \mathrm{mM})$ and sodium thioglycolate ($0.05 \%[\mathrm{wt} / \mathrm{vol}]$). Reduction products were extracted with ethyl acetate and subsequently identified by HPLC.

Liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) measurements were made with a Hewlett-Packard HP-1050 HPLC interfaced to an HP-5987 quadrupole mass spectrometer via an HP-59980-A particle beam interface. The mobile phase was $60 \%$ acetonitrile/$40 \%$ water, and the flow rate was $0.5 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{min}$. A mobile phase of $60 \%$ acetonitrile/$40 \% \mathrm{D}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ was used to measure the number of exchangeable hydrogens. LC/MS electron impact mass spectra were obtained at an ion source voltage of $5 \mathrm{eV}$ and an ion source temperature of $150^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.

Proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy ($^{1} \mathrm{H}-\mathrm{NMR}$) was performed at Florida State University by Tom Gedris, using an IBM/Bruker 270SY NMR spectrometer supported by a Tec Mag data system. Samples were dissolved in deuterated acetonitrile ($\mathrm{CD}_{3} \mathrm{CN}$) with and without $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ or $\mathrm{D}_{2} \mathrm{O}$. Trimethylsilane was used as the reference compound. Nitrite was measured as previously described (18).

Cells were removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant fluid was analyzed by HPLC. The first $10 \mathrm{ml}$ collected from the HPLC (see Materials and Methods) was designated as containing polar metabolites. Results are means of triplicate experiments; the standard deviation was $<6.0 \%$. Boiled cells were prepared in Eppendorf tubes placed in boiling water for $30 \mathrm{~min}$.

and 4ADNT appeared transiently along with small amounts of unidentified metabolites with HPLC retention times of 2.5 (compound I), 4.0 (compound II), 4.5 (compound III), and 9.5 (compound IV) min. Compounds II, III, and IV represented less than $5 \%$ of the initial amount of TNT by peak area and were not plotted. All of the metabolites eventually disappeared from the culture fluid except compound I, a polar yellow metabolite which seemed not to be further metabolized. Small amounts of nitrite were released, but only after TNT and most of the 4HADNT and 4ADNT were depleted, which suggests that the nitrite was released from one of the later metabolites.

Cell suspensions incubated with TNT in the absence of nitrobenzene transformed TNT more slowly to 4HADNT and 4ADNT, and the other metabolites were not detected (Fig. 2B). Similar results were obtained with succinate-grown cells (data not shown) incubated with TNT. Nitrobenzene was degraded over a period of $20 \mathrm{~min}$ in cultures incubated with or without TNT. Because nitrobenzene induces the enzymes responsible for its degradation in JS 52 (11a), the results indicate that nitrobenzene is required not only to induce the appropriate enzymes but also to provide reducing power for the transformation of TNT.

Origin of nitrite. Nitrite is not released by cells of strain JS 52 during growth on nitrobenzene. However, it seemed possible that TNT might alter nitrobenzene metabolism to cause the release of nitrite from nitrobenzene. Nitrobenzene-grown cells incubated with TNT and 2-aminophenol, an intermediate in nitrobenzene degradation, also produce similar amounts of nitrite (data not shown). The results clearly indicate that the nitrite was derived from TNT and not from nitrobenzene.

Mass balance determination. When cells of strain JS 52 were incubated with radiolabeled TNT and $1 \mathrm{mM}$ nitrobenzene, radioactive $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and volatile organic acids were not detectable after $2 \mathrm{~h}$ (Table 1). Polar metabolites, including compound I, accounted for a large fraction of the radioactivity in the supernatant. TNT did not sorb to cells, but the metabolites clearly became associated with the cells. The cells used in this experiment transformed TNT more slowly than cells used in other experiments. Therefore, the reaction did not go to completion during the incubation period.

Characterization of compounds. Compound I had absorbance maxima at 258, 325, and $405 \mathrm{~nm}$. The UV-visible absorbance spectrum of compound I was affected by changes in pH. Under acidic conditions ($\mathrm{pH}<1.0$), the absorbance maxima at $258 \mathrm{~nm}$ and $405 \mathrm{~nm}$ were eliminated. Under basic conditions ($\mathrm{pH}>11.0$) the absorbance maximum at $325 \mathrm{~nm}$ was reduced in size and shifted to $295 \mathrm{~nm}$ and the maximum at $258 \mathrm{~nm}$ was shifted to $248 \mathrm{~nm}$. Compound I was not extractable by ethyl acetate, chloroform, hexane, or methylene chloride at either $\mathrm{pH} 2.0,6.0$, or $10.0$ and was not characterized further.

LC/MS electron impact analyses of compounds II and III revealed molecular ions of 199 and 183, respectively (Fig. 3B and C). We postulated that compounds II and III contained hydroxylamino groups.

droxylamino groups. Therefore, LC/MS analysis of 4HADNT was done to determine whether the method was suitable for determination of molecular ions of hydroxylamino compounds. 4HADNT gave the expected parent molecular ion of 213 (Fig. 3, panel A). Molecular ions of 203, 187, and 199 were observed for compounds II, III, and 4ADNT, respectively, when the LC/MS analysis was done in the presence of deuterated water. The results indicate that compounds II and III have four exchangeable hydrogens and that 4ADNT had the expected two exchangeable hydrogens. The LC/MS data suggest that compounds II and III are dihydroxyamino-nitrotoluene and hydroxylamino-amino-nitrotoluene, respectively.

The proton NMR analysis of compound II gave chemical shift data that were consistent with a compound with protons on two hydroxylamino groups (Table 2). Compound III gave chemical shifts consistent with protons of a hydroxylamino group and an amino group (Table 2). The chemical shift of the hydroxylamino group on 4HADNT was similar to those of the hydroxylamino groups on compounds II and III (Table 2).

Unlike aromatic protons, hydroxylamino and amino protons can freely exchange with solvent protons. When D₂O was added to samples of compounds II and III and 4HADNT dissolved in CD₃CN, the NMR peaks corresponding to the proposed hydroxylamino and amino protons disappeared. The NMR peaks corresponding to the aromatic protons on compounds II and III and 4HADNT did not change in size or shift position.

Chemical shift positions of hydroxyl protons move downfield when solvent polarity is increased. The addition of H₂O to samples of 4HADNT and compounds II and III dissolved in CD₃CN caused the chemical shift position of the hydroxyl proton for 4HADNT to migrate from 6.9 to 7.95 ppm. Comparable downfield shifts of peaks corresponding to hydroxyl protons of compounds II (6.5 to 7.38, 6.55 to 7.38) and III (6.4

to 7.15) were also observed. The shift positions of the NH protons of compound II and the NH and amino protons of compounds III were moved downfield only slightly (0.05 to 0.12 ppm).

NMR spectra were consistent with the proposed structures for compounds II and III; however, determination of the positions of the hydroxylamino groups on compound II by chemical shift data is complicated (35). Therefore, compounds II and III were chemically reduced under mild conditions (see Materials and Methods) to 2,4-diamino-6-nitrotoluene (24DANT), which was identified by comparison of its HPLC retention time and UV-visible spectrum to those of authentic 24DANT. Under identical reducing conditions, the nitro groups of TNT were not transformed and 4HADNT was reduced to 4ADNT as expected.

A colorimetric test for amino groups showed that compound II did not contain an amine. 4HADNT, 24DANT, and 2ADNT gave positive results under identical conditions.

The results strongly support the identification of compound II as DHANT and compound III as 2HA4ANT. DHANT and 2HA4ANT can be stored at 4°C in the presence of air for an extended period (months) without decomposition. However, addition of DHANT or 2HA4ANT to aqueous buffer (20 mM phosphate, pH 7.5) results in the rapid conversion of DHANT to unknown compounds and the conversion of 2HA4ANT to a product tentatively identified as 2-nitroso-4-amino-6-nitrotoluene. This could explain the low levels of DHANT and 2HA4ANT detected in culture fluids of cells incubated with TNT. DHANT and 2HA4ANT are stable, however, in anoxic aqueous solutions or in aerated buffer containing NADPH.

Transformation of TNT, DHANT, AND 2HA4ANT by JS52 cell extracts. In the presence of oxygen and NADPH cell extracts of nitrobenzene-grown cells converted TNT (0.026 μmol/min/mg of protein) to near-stoichiometric amounts of 4HADNT (Fig. 4). The subsequent conversion of 4HADNT to DHANT occurred at a lower rate (Fig. 4) and the maximal accumulation of 2HA4ANT was concomitant with the disappearance of DHANT. This ordered appearance of metabolites suggests that TNT is reduced to 4HADNT, DHANT, and then 2HA4ANT. Compound I and nitrite were also produced by cell extracts in the same experiments. Because DHANT and 2HA4ANT are stable in aqueous solutions containing NADPH, greater amounts of DHANT and 2HA4ANT are detected during TNT transformation studies with cell extracts than in studies involving transformation of TNT by cells.

In contrast to the results described above, when the experiment was repeated under anaerobic conditions compound I did not appear and DHANT and 2HA4ANT accumulated. When the anaerobic reaction mixture was aerated, compound I accumulated concomitant with nitrite release. Compound IV, tentatively identified as 2-nitroso-4-amino-6-nitrotoluene (2NTS4ANT) (see below), also accumulated during the aerobic phase of the reaction. We purified compound IV by HPLC and added it to phosphate buffer (20 mM, pH 7.5) containing NADPH (100 μM). Under these conditions, compound IV was converted rapidly to 2HA4ANT; similar conversions have been described previously (2). Further investigation showed that 2HA4ANT was converted to a product with identical retention time and UV-visible absorbance spectrum to those of compound IV in aerated potassium phosphate buffer (20 mM, pH 7.5).

In the presence of oxygen and NADPH, extracts prepared from succinate-grown JS52 cells slowly transformed TNT to 4HADNT (data not shown), indicating that the enzyme responsible for the production of DHANT was inducible. We further investigated the transformation of DHANT and 2HA4ANT by incubating each compound with cell extracts from nitroben-

nitrobenzene-grown cells in the presence of NADPH. DHANT was converted to both 2HA4ANT and the yellow polar metabolite (compound I) (data not shown), whereas 2HA4ANT was further metabolized without being converted to the yellow polar metabolite.

Transformation of \[^{14}C\]TNT by cell extracts. More radioactivity was associated with trichloroacetic acid (TCA)-precipitable material when cell extracts were incubated aerobically with radiolabeled TNT than when they were incubated under O₂-limited conditions. This indicates that oxygen is required for the binding of TNT metabolites to TCA-precipitable material in cell extract. Recent studies have shown that other TNT metabolites can also bind to cell components (1, 10, 25, 26). The increased levels of accumulation of DHANT and 2HA4ANT under O₂-limited conditions suggest that these two metabolites are transformed by an O₂-dependent mechanism to metabolites that bind to TCA-precipitable material.

Transformation of nitroaromatic compounds by nitrobenzene nitroreductase. In the presence of NADPH, nitrobenzene nitroreductase catalyzed the stoichiometric transformation of TNT (79 μmol/min/mg of protein) to DHANT via 4HADNT (Fig. 5). No other products were detected by HPLC. Four moles of NADPH were required to reduce 1 mol of TNT to DHANT. In the presence of NADPH, nitrobenzene nitroreductase converted 4ADNT to 2HA4ANT. 24DANT and 26DANT were not transformed (data not shown).

DISCUSSION

P. pseudoalcaligenes JS52 rapidly transforms TNT, and the enzyme(s) responsible for the elimination of TNT is inducible by nitrobenzene. The latter fact is supported by the observation that succinate-grown cells incubated with succinate and TNT do not produce DHANT, 2HA4ANT, or the yellow metabolite. In addition to its role as an inducer, nitrobenzene also seems to provide reducing equivalents for the reactions.

The initial products of TNT transformation by JS52 differ from the monoamino and diamino compounds produced by reduction of TNT in other bacterial systems. Our results indicate that cells and cell extracts of strain JS52 convert TNT to end products via the hydroxylamino intermediates DHANT

and 2HA4ANT (Fig. 6) and that nitrobenzene nitroreductase is responsible for the conversion of TNT to DHANT (Fig. 5). Because nitrobenzene nitroreductase does not reduce nitro groups to amines (34), JS52 must contain another nitroreductase(s) capable of reducing hydroxylamino groups to the corresponding amines at a low rate. Nonspecific nitroreductases that reduce TNT to amino compounds have been isolated from a number of organisms, including bacteria (8, 9, 29, 31), yeast (33), and mammals (31).

The mechanism responsible for the synthesis of the yellow polar metabolite (compound I) and the identity of the compound are not known. It is clear, however, that DHANT can be converted to compound I and 2HA4ANT. Therefore at least two pathways exist for the transformation of DHANT (Fig. 6). 2HA4ANT is subsequently converted to a product we have tentatively identified as 2-nitroso-4-amino-6-nitrotoluene (Fig. 6). The conversion appears to be nonenzymatic because 2HA4ANT is readily oxidized to 2-nitroso-4-amino-6-nitrotoluene in buffer solutions.

Although TNT was not mineralized, the oxygen-dependent release of nitrite concomitant with the synthesis of compound I suggests that nitrite is released from the precursor of compound I. We are currently investigating the structure of compound I because it may prove to be a product of ring fission by JS52. Similarly, in *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* MAO1, oxygen was required for the formation of polar metabolites from TNT, 2-amino-4,6-dinitrotoluene, and 4ADNT, which suggested that the polar metabolites were ring cleavage products (1).

DHANT and 2HA4ANT have been proposed as intermediates in the reductive transformation pathway of TNT (34). The detailed characterization and quantitation presented here provide clear evidence that DHANT and 2HA4ANT are produced during the transformation of TNT by JS52. It is likely that DHANT and 2HA4ANT are produced by other microbial systems; however, their inherent instability, especially in the presence of a nonreducing aqueous buffer, might preclude isolation and characterization. Furthermore, in other systems the typical nitroreductase enzymes seem to more readily reduce nitro groups to the corresponding amines.

4HADNT, DHANT, and 2HA4ANT were extremely sus-
ceptible to reduction under a variety of LC/MS and GC/MS experimental conditions in our hands. Reduction of nitroso and nitroaromatic compounds to amines under chemical ionization conditions have been reported by several investigators (7, 21, 44). Harrison and Kallury, for example, noted a temperature-dependent reduction of mononitroarenes under chemical ionization conditions (21). We determined that mild analytical conditions (low temperature and voltage) were crucial for the identification of DHANT and 2HA4ANT. In contrast, Duque et al. reported using GC/MS under normal conditions to identify 2,6-dihydroxylamino-4-nitrotoluene (12).

It seems likely that other reactions are involved in the metabolism of TNT by strain JS52 because the final products of TNT transformation were not identified. A large portion of the carbon from TNT is bound to cells or TCA-precipitable material. Such binding is probably due to the chemical reactivity of the hydroxylamino compounds. Reduced metabolites of TNT have been shown to form adducts with biomolecules in other systems (25, 26). For example, Carpenter et al. reported the formation of polyamide compounds in activated sludges incubated with radiolabeled TNT (10). They proposed that polyamides were formed by reactions involving TNT biotransformation products and cellular lipids, fatty acids, and proteins. It has been proposed that immobilization of TNT metabolites via irreversible binding may be an acceptable end point for bioremediation (6, 34). Further research is needed to identify the end products of TNT transformation by strain JS52 and to elucidate the mechanism of nitrite release.
