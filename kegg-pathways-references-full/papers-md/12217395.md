Fig. 4. ARF restores both exocytosis and PLD activity in antigen-stimulated permeabilised RBL-mast cells: (a) permeabilisation of RBL cells with streptolysin-O leads to the release of ARF proteins; (b and c) progressive loss of exocytosis and PLD activation as the time of permeabilisation is increased prior to addition
of antigen-mediated secretion by ARF was dependent on MgATP; (b) both the PH domain of PLCδ and neomycin potently inhibited antigen-mediated secretion when restored with ARF; and (c) prior hydrolysis of PIP₂ by PLCδ inhibited the ability of ARF to reconstitute antigen-mediated exocytosis. These data altogether supported the model that the production of PA by
