Bacterial type IV secretion:  
conjugation systems adapted to  
deliver effector molecules to host cells  

**Peter J. Christie and Joseph P. Vogel**

Several bacterial pathogens utilize  
conjugation machines to export effector  
molecules during infection. Such systems  
are members of the type IV or ‘adapted  
conjugation’ secretion family. The  
prototypical type IV system is the

Putative channel components

Several lines of evidence suggest that VirB6–VirB10 as well as one or more of the three ATPases (see below) are probable channel subunits³. VirB6, a highly hydrophobic protein, is thought to span the cytoplasmic membrane several times and presently is the best candidate for a channel-forming protein³. VirB7, an outer membrane
pathway⁴⁵. In addition, both the type IV and II systems permit transmission of nucleic acids across the cell envelope. A recent report showed that the same type II system (Eps) that mediates CT export also serves as the conduit for secretion of the filamentous phage CTXφ across the outer membrane of *Vibrio cholerae*⁴⁵. Thus, although the
