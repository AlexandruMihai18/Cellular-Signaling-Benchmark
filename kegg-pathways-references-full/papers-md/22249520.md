Sirtuins mediate mammalian metabolic responses to nutrient availability

Angeliki Chalkiadaki and Leonard Guarente

Abstract | Metabolic diseases are an increasing threat in developed countries. Dysregulation of metabolic pathways, caused by imbalances in energy homeostasis, leads to obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease with devastating results for both individuals and societies. Sirtuins, a conserved family of NAD⁺-dependent deacetylase enzymes found in many species, regulate various metabolic pathways and have emerged as important sensors of energy status in mammals. The nuclear sirtuins, SIRT1, SIRT6 and SIRT7, regulate the activity of key transcription factors and cofactors of numerous metabolic pathways in almost all tissues by linking nutrient signals with the cellular responses to energy demands. The mitochondrial sirtuins, SIRT3, SIRT4 and SIRT5, regulate the activity of important mitochondrial enzymes and drive metabolic cycles in response to fasting and calorie restriction. Accumulating evidence indicates that sirtuins can be beneficial in the prevention of metabolic and age-related diseases and suggests that they can be pharmacologically activated to ameliorate such diseases. This Review describes the latest advances in the understanding of the function of sirtuins as regulators of mammalian metabolism and focuses on the role of these enzymes as mediators of nutrient availability.

Introduction

Sirtuins are the class III histone deacetylase family, and use NAD⁺ as a cofactor.¹ Physiological changes resulting from states of high energy demand lead to increased NAD⁺ levels and activation of sirtuins, which contributes to prevention of diabetes mellitus, cancer, cardiovascular disease, inflammatory diseases and neurodegenerative conditions (Figure 1). The first member of the sirtuin family of proteins to be identified was the Saccharomyces cerevisiae NAD⁺-dependent histone deacetylase SIR2 (which is also known as silent information regulator 2). The SIR2 gene was originally discovered as one of the genes that encode a chromatin-silencing complex (Sir1–Sir4), which represses gene transcription.² SIR2-dependent transcriptional silencing also occurs at telomeres³ and ribosomal DNA (rDNA) repeats.⁴⁻⁵ Subsequent work showed that Sir2 was necessary and sufficient to prolong the replicative lifespan of budding yeast by reducing the number of extrachromosomal rDNA circles.⁶⁻⁷ Sir2 orthologous genes in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (sir-2.1)⁸⁻⁹ and in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster (Sir2)¹⁰ also function to increase lifespan.

Interestingly, this role of Sir2 is essentially conserved in mammals, where SIR2 slows the decline in vital functions of tissues and organs associated with aging.¹¹ In mammals, seven genes that are orthologous to Sir2 have been identified, SIRT1–7. Mammalian sirtuins regulate various cellular functions by deacetylating numerous substrates and thereby modulating their activity. SIRT1, which is the mammalian sirtuin most closely related to yeast Sir2 and the most studied sirtuin in mammals, has a role in the prevention of a number of age-related diseases.¹² SIRT1, SIRT6 and SIRT7 are localized in the nucleus of most cell types and have a role in transcriptional regulation, through targeting of transcription factors, cofactors or histones. SIRT2 is mostly found in the cytoplasm, and has roles in oligodendrocyte differentiation¹³ and in cell cycle control.¹⁴ SIRT3, SIRT4 and SIRT5 are primarily localized in mitochondria, and regulate the activities of metabolic enzymes¹⁵ and oxidative stress pathways.¹⁶

In this Review we discuss the regulatory roles of sirtuins in mammalian metabolism with a focus on the latest advances in this field. We summarize the function of these proteins in different metabolic tissues during the diurnal cycle, in alternating fed and fasted states, and under conditions of increased energy demands. We also describe various metabolic and age-related diseases in which sirtuins are implicated. Finally we discuss the possibility of pharmacologically activating sirtuins to prevent such diseases.

The key role of NAD⁺

The connection of sirtuins to metabolism was revealed when their enzymatic activity was discovered. Sirtuins are characterized by a conserved core domain containing the NAD⁺ binding domain and the catalytic domain.¹⁷⁻¹⁹

![Figure 1](#fig1) | Sirtuins affect multiple diseases. Sirtuins are activated by elevated NAD⁺ levels induced during states of high energy demand, such as fasting, calorie restriction and exercise. Sirtuins deacetylate (or ADP-ribosylate) numerous transcription factors, cofactors, histones and enzymes that alter the outputs of metabolic and stress-induced pathways. Thus, activation of sirtuins counteracts the pathogenic mechanisms underlying many age-related diseases.

Sirtuins require NAD⁺ as a cofactor to deacetylate target proteins and modify their function.¹,²⁰ As intracellular NAD⁺ levels fluctuate in response to nutrient availability, sirtuins function as mediators to translate metabolic cues received from the environment. When nutrients are plentiful, cellular metabolism relies mainly on glycolysis to produce energy, leading to generation of ATP and conversion of NAD⁺ to NADH. Low levels of NAD⁺ and high levels of NADH result in inactivation of the enzymatic activity of sirtuins. By contrast, in times of food scarcity, such as during fasting or calorie restriction (Box 1), elevated levels of NAD⁺ in the nucleus and cytoplasm result in increased enzymatic activity of sirtuins. SIRT1 activation helps to redirect cellular metabolism from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation by deacetylating and activating transcription factors and cofactors, such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α).²¹ Oxidative phosphorylation occurs in mitochondria and is coupled to the conversion of NADH (generated by the tricarboxylic acid [TCA] cycle) to NAD⁺ via the electron transport chain. Clearly, sirtuins, as NAD⁺-dependent deacetylases, are uniquely positioned to act as central metabolic sensors of nutrient availability in the cell.

NAD⁺ can be synthesized *de novo* within cells by a two-step enzymatic reaction (Figure 2). First, the enzyme nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (Nampt) converts nicotinamide to nicotinamide mononucleotide,²²,²³ which is then converted to NAD⁺ by nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase (Nmnat).²⁴ Interestingly, expression of the NAMPT gene (and, therefore, NAD⁺ levels) is regulated by transcription factors that control the circadian clock. Many metabolic functions, including hepatic gluconeogenesis and lipogenesis, are regulated by components of the circadian clock, so that they respond to the alternating feeding (awake) and fasting (asleep) states.²⁵ Central to these circadian rhythm oscillations are the transcription factors CLOCK and ARNTL (also known as BMAL1). The products of their target genes, PER2 and CRY1, form a negative feedback loop by repressing transcription of the CLOCK and ARNTL genes. SIRT1 regulates the circadian rhythm in the liver (and perhaps in other tissues) by two mechanisms: deacetylating and activating the transcriptional activity of ARNTL, and deacetylating and allowing the degradation of PER2 by the proteasomal machinery.²⁵⁻²⁷ SIRT1 completes a circadian metabolic cycle by regulating Nampt and the synthesis of its own cofactor, NAD⁺ (Figure 2).²⁸,²⁹ In addition, expression of the NAMPT gene is upregulated in serum-deprived or glucose-deprived cells, or in the skeletal muscle of fasting mice.³⁰,³¹ NAD⁺ levels are also elevated in muscle during calorie restriction.³²

Another family of enzymes that use NAD⁺ as a cofactor is the poly (ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs). These enzymes ADP-ribosylate target proteins and regulate a wide range of cellular functions, including telomere maintenance, DNA repair, cell proliferation and apoptosis.³³ Activation of PARPs under conditions of cellular stress leads to depletion of the NAD⁺ pool from the cell³⁴ concomitantly with inhibition of SIRT1 activity.³⁵,³⁶ Competition between PARPs and SIRT1 for NAD⁺ has deleterious effects on whole-body metabolism. Mice deficient in either PARP1 or PARP2 are lean, show increased energy expenditure and are protected from both diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance.³⁷,³⁸ SIRT1 activity is upregulated in these mice and they have a similar phenotype to that of mice in which SIRT1 is overexpressed or chemically activated.³⁹ In PARP1-null mice, NAD⁺ levels are increased, which could explain why SIRT1 is activated in these mice.³⁸ Interestingly, the mechanism of SIRT1 activation in PARP2-null mice is different, as PARP2 directly represses the SIRT1 promoter. In PARP2-deficient mice, elevated SIRT1 protein levels are associated with protection from obesity. However, PARP2-null mice become glucose-intolerant when fed a high-fat diet, a phenotype related to pancreatic failure caused by defective proliferation and function of β cells.³⁷

### Nuclear sirtuins affect metabolism

SIRT1, SIRT6 and SIRT7 are localized in the nucleus and regulate metabolism at multiple levels. In response to metabolic cues, SIRT1 regulates the function of numerous transcription factors and cofactors in almost all tissues (Table 1). SIRT6 is mainly involved in processes related to chromatin and regulates several pathways of cellular metabolism. SIRT7 is probably the least studied sirtuin; it localizes to the nucleolus and activates RNA polymerase I transcription.⁴⁰ SIRT7-null mice develop inflammatory cardiomyopathy and die prematurely.⁴¹

### Hepatic carbohydrate metabolism

The liver has a central role in the regulation of whole-body glucose homeostasis. Under conditions of fasting
or calorie restriction glucose levels in the blood are low and hepatic metabolism switches to glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis to supply the body with the necessary glucose—especially in the brain, which is an organ that cannot use fatty acids to produce energy.²² The hepatic response to fasting occurs in two phases. In the early phase, short-term fasting results in induction of gluconeogenesis. Prolonged fasting, however, results in transition to a late-phase response, in which gluconeogenesis is accompanied by an increase of fatty acid oxidation and mitochondrial biogenesis to accommodate the increased energy demands of the body. The transition from early to late phase requires the coordinated actions of a number of transcription factors and cofactors (Figure 3a).

SIRT1 is a regulator of the metabolic switch from the early to the late phase of gluconeogenesis during fasting.⁴³ During the early stages, high levels of glucagon induce cyclic AMP response element binding protein (CREB) and its coactivator, CREB-regulated transcription coactivator 2 (CRTC2), to drive the expression of genes encoding key enzymes for gluconeogenesis.⁴⁴ SIRT1 is activated at late stages of fasting to attenuate these effects of glucagon by deacetylating CRTC2, which enables its ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation.⁴³ At the same time, SIRT1 deacetylates and activates two other key transcription regulators involved in gluconeogenesis, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) γ coactivator 1α (PGC-1α) and forkhead box O1 (FOXO1).²¹,⁴⁵ PGC-1α and FOXO1, like CREB and CRTC2, can also maintain expression of gluconeogenic genes.⁴⁶ PPARα activity is also induced by SIRT1, which, along with deacetylated PGC-1α, activates genes whose products promote fatty acid oxidation and mitochondrial biogenesis.⁴⁷ Finally, SIRT1 deacetylates and inhibits STAT3, which normally acts as a transcriptional repressor of gluconeogenic genes.⁴⁸ Thus, SIRT1 orchestrates the activity of an array of transcription factors that can alter hepatic glucose output during fasting, and also respond to the duration of fasting.

### Hepatic lipid and cholesterol metabolism

The liver also has a central role in the control of lipid and cholesterol metabolism. In periods of energy limitation, the liver shuts off lipid and cholesterol synthesis

**Box 1 | Links between sirtuins and calorie restriction**

Calorie restriction is defined as a diet that supplies all essential nutrients, but in which calories are reduced by 20–40% compared to ad libitum feeding. Calorie restriction prolongs lifespan in many organisms.¹⁵² The hypothesis that sirtuins might mediate the beneficial effects of calorie restriction was based on their enzymatic activity.¹,¹⁵³ Sirtuins depend on NAD⁺, the levels of which are elevated under calorie restriction in most metabolic tissues.³² Calorie restriction is characterized by certain behaviors, such as increased activity, improved glucose and insulin metabolism, reduced IGF-I signaling and reduced reproduction. Whole-body SIRT1-null mice and brain-specific SIRT1-knockout mice do not display the behavioral changes and the reduction in IGF-I signaling observed in wild-type mice under calorie restriction.¹⁵⁴,¹⁵⁵ Conversely, mice that modestly overexpress SIRT1 share physiological characteristics with wild-type mice under calorie restriction, including leanness, improved glucose tolerance and decreased blood cholesterol and insulin levels.¹⁵⁶

The mitochondrial sirtuins SIRT3 and SIRT5 are also activated by calorie restriction. SIRT3 suppresses production of reactive oxygen species and induces oxidation of fatty acids, providing an important link between calorie restriction and metabolic adaptations.¹²⁴,¹²⁷,¹²⁸ These changes might result in a decreased incidence of age-related diseases. SIRT5 is activated in calorie restriction and upregulates the urea cycle to dispose of ammonia, which is a toxic by-product of amino acid catabolism.¹³⁷ By contrast, SIRT4 activity is repressed under calorie restriction, to allow amino acid catabolism to provide energy. In times of plentiful food, SIRT4 activity in β cells results in increased insulin secretion.²¹³⁶

and storage, and activates lipolysis pathways to supply the fasting organism with energy. This switch is achieved mainly by inactivation of the sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP) family of transcription factors, which sense cellular cholesterol levels and activate genes whose products are involved in lipogenesis and cholesterol synthesis. During fasting, the expression of SREBPs is downregulated.⁴⁹,⁵⁰ SIRT1 also regulates SREBP1 stability under fasting conditions through deacetylation, which targets this protein for ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation (Figure 4b).⁵¹,⁵² This function might explain why some studies have reported liver steatosis in mice with liver-specific knockout of SIRT1.⁴⁷,⁵³

SIRT1 also has a beneficial role in lowering blood cholesterol levels, by mediating cholesterol efflux and promoting cholesterol degradation into bile acids. SIRT1 regulates the activity of the oxysterol receptor (LXRα) to facilitate reverse cholesterol transport from peripheral tissues by inducing expression of the ATP-binding

**Figure 2 | Circadian cycle of NAD⁺ synthesis and SIRT1 activity.** NAD⁺ synthesis requires the activity of two enzymes, Nampt and Nmnat. SIRT1 feedback regulates the synthesis of NAD⁺ by regulating the activity of the transcription complex CLOCK–ARNTL and PER2, which control NAMPT gene expression. **a |** Accumulation of PER2 to a critical level causes PER2 to complex with CLOCK–ARNTL, which suppresses gene transcription. **b |** SIRT1 promotes PER2 deacetylation and proteosomal degradation, and also deacetylates ARNTL, activating its transcriptional activity.

autophagy-inducing genes.77 Induction of autophagy is also important for the maintenance of kidney function under hypoxic conditions. Aging attenuates autophagy, but calorie restriction restores the autophagic response of kidney cells during hypoxia. Importantly, SIRT1 mediates the induction of autophagy during hypoxia and under calorie restriction, by activating the FOXO3 transcription factor.78

Reversal of the metabolic syndrome

The metabolic syndrome is characterized by features of metabolic dysfunction—including high blood pressure and elevated cholesterol, triglyceride and blood glucose levels—which are often associated with atherosclerosis, insulin resistance and obesity.79 Patients diagnosed as having the metabolic syndrome are at high risk of life-threatening conditions, such as stroke and heart failure. Several lines of evidence support the existence of a role for SIRT1 in counteracting many features of the metabolic syndrome. SIRT1 has an inhibitory effect on adipocyte differentiation and fat tissue accumulation, by inhibiting the activity of the master regulator of adipogenesis PPARγ.80,81 In addition, SIRT1 enhances the secretion of insulin from pancreatic β cells by repressing the transcription of uncoupling protein 2 (encoded by UCP2).82,83 SIRT1 also mediates protection against hyperglycemia-induced toxicity and failure of pancreatic β cells by deacetylating FOXO1 in response to oxidative stress caused by hyperglycemia.84

Systemic activation of SIRT1 by oral administration of chemical activators, such as resveratrol and SRT1720 (see below) results in increased energy expenditure and improved metabolic phenotypes under conditions of obesity, at least in part through PGC-1α activation in skeletal muscle.85–88 SIRT1 overexpression from its natural promoter in transgenic mice also yields protection from the deleterious effects of a high-fat diet and the metabolic decline associated with normal aging.89,90 SIRT1 transgenic mice fed a high-fat diet are more glucose tolerant,

leaner and metabolically fitter than control mice. The roles of SIRT1 in hepatic cholesterol, lipid and bile acid metabolism and in skeletal muscle energy production probably contribute to the increased insulin sensitivity and the improved metabolic phenotype of these animals.

Obesity and the metabolic syndrome are also characterized by low-grade systemic inflammation, which is strongly associated with the development of insulin resistance.91 SIRT1 regulates inflammation and energy balance by repressing the activity of nuclear factor κB (NFκB),92 one of the main regulators of the inflammatory response. Indeed, SIRT1 deletion from macrophages results in aberrant activation of the proinflammatory pathway and whole-body metabolic dysfunction in mice that have been fed a high-fat diet.93 SIRT1 also acts in pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons in the hypothalamus to regulate energy expenditure and body weight.94–96 Interestingly, hypothalamic NFκB regulates central insulin and leptin signaling during obesity,97,98 and might be a SIRT1 target in this tissue. Additionally, SIRT1 activity in neurons that express steroidogenic factor 1 has a protective effect against the development of insulin resistance in skeletal muscle in response to a high-fat diet. SIRT1 in these neurons mediates the antidiabetic effects of the neuropeptide orexin A.99

Vascular endothelium regulation

The metabolic syndrome is associated with atherosclerosis, a condition characterized by increased thickness, stiffness and inflammation of blood vessels caused by the presence of leukocytes and macrophages. Atherosclerotic and aged blood vessels have a reduced capacity to regenerate and are prone to senescence and cell death. The healthy function of the vascular endothelium depends on the activity of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and production of nitric oxide. Nitric oxide has a vasodilator activity, inhibits the accumulation of atherosclerotic plaques and promotes the proliferation of smooth muscle cells and angiogenesis.100

**Box 2 | Mitochondrial metabolic cycles**

Mitochondria have a central role in energy production and also respond to changes in nutrient availability. Mitochondria catabolize fatty acids, amino acids and pyruvate to produce NADH via the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Electrons from NADH are transported through the electron chain to create a proton gradient across mitochondrial membranes, which drives the production of ATP by ATP synthase.

A byproduct of the electron chain is the production of ROS, which can be deleterious for the integrity of nucleic acids, proteins and lipids. Aging and age-related diseases are characterized by increased production of ROS. Mechanisms that reduce levels of ROS, such as activation of SIRT3, might be beneficial against age-related diseases.

Abbreviation: ROS, reactive oxygen species.

**Whole-body glucose regulation**

Accumulating evidence supports the link between the epigenetic regulation of chromatin (via the methylation and acetylation status of histones) and metabolism. ${}^{111}$ SIRT6 regulates chromatin by acting as a co-repressor, deacetylating lysine 9 of histone H3 at NFκB-regulated promoters. ${}^{112,113}$ Thus, both SIRT1 and SIRT6 suppress NFκB activity. Aberrant activation of NFκB signaling in SIRT6-null mice could explain the enhanced apoptosis, cellular senescence, tissue degeneration and premature aging phenotype of these animals. ${}^{194}$

SIRT6 also has a key role in glucose homeostasis, as shown in whole-body SIRT6-null mice, which demonstrate severe hypoglycemia and premature death. ${}^{114,115}$ The metabolic defect in these mice is caused by increased glucose uptake by the liver and skeletal muscle. ${}^{115}$ During normoxia, SIRT6 also co-represses the expression of HIF-1α target genes that encode glycolytic enzymes. Under conditions of reduced oxygen levels, HIF-1α activates glycolysis, glucose transporters (GLUT1, GLUT3) and glycolytic enzymes (lactate dehydrogenase, phosphoglycerate kinase 1, phosphofructokinase 1), and simultaneously inhibits mitochondrial respiration. ${}^{116}$ As mentioned above, SIRT1 also represses HIF-1α, ${}^{108}$ and some evidence indicates that SIRT1 and SIRT6 might be part of a linear pathway, as SIRT1 co-activates the FOXO3–nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF1) transcription complex on the SIRT6 promoter. ${}^{117}$

**Mitochondrial enzyme regulation**

Mitochondria have a central role in energy production, and they respond and adapt to changes in nutrient availability (Box 2). As discussed above, SIRT1 regulates mitochondrial function and mitochondrial biogenesis by deacetylating and activating PGC-1α, which has an important role in the expression of mitochondrial genes. In addition, mitochondrial sirtuins function as metabolic sensors and regulate adaptive responses to changes in available energy. SIRT3, SIRT4 and SIRT5 all regulate mitochondrial enzymes (Figure 4).

**Metabolic response to fasting in mitochondria**

Hundreds of mitochondrial proteins are acetylated, and SIRT3 seems to be the major deacetylase in this organelle. ${}^{118}$ SIRT3 protein levels and activity are upregulated in mitochondria under fasting conditions. ${}^{118,119}$ Indeed, SIRT3 enhances lipid catabolism by deacetylating and activating long-chain-specific acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase (LCAD), a key enzyme in the fatty acid oxidation pathway. ${}^{119}$ SIRT3-null mice have hyperacetylated LCAD and defective fatty acid oxidation, which results in reduced production of ATP, development of fatty liver and increased sensitivity to cold. ${}^{119}$ SIRT3 also mediates the conversion of acetate into acetyl-coenzyme A, by deacetylating and activating acetyl-coenzyme A synthetase. ${}^{120,121}$ SIRT3 might also regulate the TCA cycle itself, as it interacts with the TCA enzymes succinate dehydrogenase and isocitrate dehydrogenase 2. ${}^{122-124}$

SIRT3 also bridges energy deficits by deacetylating and activating hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A

synthase, mitochondrial,^{125} which is the rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of the ketone β-hydroxybutyrate. Another link between SIRT3 and the adaptive response to fasting is the regulation of the urea cycle, which clears away ammonia produced by protein breakdown during conditions of energy limitation. SIRT3 promotes the urea cycle by deacetylating and activating the enzyme ornithine transcarbamoylase.^{126}

Increased mitochondrial activity could result in increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which cause oxidative stress (Box 2). SIRT3 has been implicated in the suppression of ROS at multiple levels, protecting cells from oxidative stress.^{16} A critical enzyme for the removal of ROS is manganese superoxide dismutase 2, which is deacetylated and activated by SIRT3 during calorie restriction (Box 1).^{127,128} SIRT3 is also involved in ROS removal by a second mechanism, whereby it activates isocitrate dehydrogenase 2^{123,124} and glutamate dehydrogenase 1,^{118,123} which both result in increased levels of NADPH in mitochondria. NADPH is necessary for glutathione reductase to detoxify ROS. Finally, SIRT3 promotes efficient flow of electrons through the electron transport chain, by interacting with and activating components of complex I, complex II and complex III, and could, therefore, suppress the production of ROS.^{121,122,129,130}

Oxidative damage to proteins and DNA increases with age, and can lead to increased susceptibility to many pathological conditions, including cancer and neuronal loss. For example, age-related hearing loss is caused by oxidative damage in the spiral ganglia neurons and sensory hair cells in the cochlea. Calorie restriction fully protects against age-related hearing loss in mice, and this protection is mediated by SIRT3.^{124} Further studies might show that the protective activity of SIRT3 could extend to other cell types affected by age-related functional decline. Increased ROS production is associated with increased susceptibility to cancer as a result of activation of HIF-1α, which favors tumor growth by upregulating glycolysis and angiogenesis.^{131,132} SIRT3-null mice develop mammary tumors,^{130} and roughly 40% of breast and ovarian tumors from human patients with cancer have decreased levels of SIRT3.^{133} Absence of SIRT3 results in increases in both ROS production and HIF-1α activity which, in turn, promote cancer susceptibility.^{133,134} Importantly, overexpression of SIRT3 in xenografts suppresses tumor growth in mice.^{134} SIRT1 also protects against oxidative stress and ROS, partly by regulating the transcriptional activity of FOXO transcription factors in neurons^{135} and pancreatic β cells.^{84}

### SIRT4 and SIRT5 regulate mitochondrial enzymes

In contrast to the other sirtuins, which all have deacetylase activities, SIRT4 only seems to have NAD⁺-dependent ADP-ribosyl transferase activity. SIRT4 regulates amino acid catabolism, which is activated in the setting of calorie restriction, by ADP-ribosylating and repressing glutamate dehydrogenase.^{136} However,

the mechanism by which SIRT4 activity is down-regulated in conditions of energy limitation has not yet been defined.

SIRT5 is also a mitochondrial enzyme, and regulates the urea cycle by deacetylating and activating the rate-limiting enzyme in the urea cycle carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1.^{137} Interestingly, SIRT3 and SIRT5 regulate different steps in this cycle, to clear ammonia and prevent its toxic effects in conditions of nutrient limitation.

### Therapeutic strategies using sirtuins

After the importance of SIRT1 in mediating the beneficial effects of calorie restriction was recognized, several small-molecule activators of SIRT1 enzymatic activity were described. Resveratrol is a natural polyphenol extracted from plants and was the first molecule shown to activate SIRT1.^{138} Mice treated with resveratrol are protected from the metabolic deterioration induced by a high-fat diet.^{85,86} Chemical activators of SIRT1 that are more potent and specific than resveratrol, including SRT1720 and SRT2183, also have protective effects against metabolic diseases.^{87,88} However, studies of the efficacy of these drugs have reported conflicting results; some evidence suggests that these drugs do not activate SIRT1,^{139,140} whereas another trial demonstrated accelerated SIRT1-mediated deacetylation of a native peptide substrate of this enzyme.^{141} Further studies are needed to reveal the mechanism of action of these drugs and their potential for treating age-related diseases.

Factors that affect SIRT1 expression could also be used in therapeutic strategies to modify the activity of sirtuins. For example, SIRT1 transcription is activated by p53 and FOXO3,^{142} and repressed by hypermethylated in cancer 1 (HIC1) or adenoviral E1A protein-interacting C-terminal-binding protein (CtBP).^{143,144} SIRT1 enzymatic activity is also increased by interaction with other proteins, such as active regulator of SIRT1 (AROS),^{145} and inhibited by deleted in breast cancer 1 (DBC-1, also known as protein KIAA1967).^{146,147} Interestingly, DBC1-null mice have improved metabolic phenotypes that resemble those of SIRT1-overexpressing mice.^{148} SIRT1 is also regulated by post-translational modifications: it is phosphorylated by mitogen-activated protein kinase 8 (MAPK8, also known as JNK1), cyclin B, cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) or dual specificity tyrosine-phosphorylation-regulated kinases (DYRK) 1A and 3, with variable effects on its activity.^{149–151}

More research is needed to establish the importance of sirtuins such as SIRT3 and SIRT6 in cancer and metabolic and age-related diseases, and to elucidate pathways that regulate their activity. This information could lead to development of specific sirtuin-activating drugs. Since SIRT3 seems to counteract the production of ROS, identifying chemical activators of this sirtuin might have important therapeutic consequences.

### Conclusions

Over a decade ago, murine Sir2 and its mammalian counterpart SIRT1 were identified as NAD⁺-dependent deacetylases. Subsequent work has shown that sirtuins

have important roles in a wide range of biological functions and influence various disorders associated with aging, including cancer, neurodegenerative conditions and metabolic diseases. Sirtuins can work as sensors of the energy status of cells and organisms and deacetylate target proteins to modify physiological and metabolic pathways. Thus, sirtuins help to mediate adaptations to calorie restriction in mammals, and contribute to the health benefits associated with a low-calorie diet. Chemical activation of sirtuins could mimic calorie restriction and thereby mitigate diseases that characterize aging.
