### Abstract

Acetan is an anionic bacterial polysaccharide. The chemical repeat unit consists of a cellobiose unit solubilised by attachment of a charged pentasaccharide sidechain to one of the glucose residues. The repeat unit contains two sites of acetylation. ${}^{1}\mathrm{H}$ and ${}^{13}\mathrm{C}$ NMR studies, coupled with both basic-methylation and mild-methylation studies, have shown that acetylation occurs at C6 on the (1,2)-D-Man and the (1,34)-D-Glc residues. A variety of techniques including NMR, optical rotation, circular dichroism and DSC show evidence for a thermoreversible conformational order (helix)-disorder (coil) transition for acetan in aqueous solution. The studies suggest that acetylation of the backbone does not prevent helix formation.

### 1. Introduction

Acetan is an anionic heteropolysaccharide secreted by the gram-negative bacterium *Acetobacter xylinum* strain B42 [1]. The chemical structure of acetan [1,2] is similar to that of xanthan [3,4] and consists of a cellulosic backbone substituted on alternate glucose residues with a charged pentasaccharide sidechain (Fig. 1). Recent NMR studies suggest incomplete $O$-acetylation at C6 of the mannose residue and at C6 of the branched glucose residue in the polymer backbone [5]. Analysis of the X-ray diffraction patterns obtained from oriented fibres [1,6,7] suggest that acetan adopts a 5-fold helical structure with a pitch of 4.8 nm similar to that formed by xanthan [8]. Recent AFM studies of acetan have imaged the helical structure of the polysaccharide [9]. Preliminary studies by optical rotation [6] have indicated that acetan undergoes a thermoreversible conformational transition in aqueous solution. In the present study the sites of acetylation of the acetan backbone and sidechain have been confirmed. In addition the techniques of NMR, optical rotation, circular dichroism and DSC have been used to confirm that acetylation of the

### 2. Materials and methods

Native acetan was prepared according to the procedures described by MacCormick and co-workers [10]. The charged acetan polysaccharide was purified by selective precipitation with hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) using the method described by Scott [11]. This preparation procedure results in the sodium salt form of the polysaccharide. Subsequent analysis has revealed that acetan contains mM quantities of sodium chloride.

Acetan solutions were prepared by dispersing the freeze-dried sample by stirring overnight at ambient temperature. Samples for NMR studies were dissolved in $\mathrm{D}_{2} \mathrm{O}$. All other solutions were prepared using deionised distilled water. Solutions for chirooptical studies were clarified by filtration through 0.65 $\mu \mathrm{m}$ Millipore filters. Optical rotation was measured at 365 nm on a Perkin-Elmer 241 polarimeter, using a jacketed cell of pathlength 10 cm. Temperature was controlled by a Haake circulating water bath and monitored by a thermocouple in the neck of the cell

(but out of the light path). Readings were taken at temperature intervals of $5^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ on heating and cooling between $10$ and $95^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, with a $15 \mathrm{~min}$ equilibration period at each temperature.

Circular dichroism spectra were recorded over a wavelength range $190-260 \mathrm{~nm}$ on a Yobin-Yvon Mk V dichrograph, using a $1 \mathrm{~s}$ integration period and $1 \mathrm{~mm}$ pathlength. Temperature was again recorded with a thermocouple in the neck of the cell.

DSC measurements were made over the temperature range $5-95^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ on a Setaram microcalorimeter. Heating and cooling rates were $0.5^{\circ} \mathrm{C} \min ^{-1}$.

The following methods were used for chemical analysis. Gas-liquid chromatography was performed on a Hewlett-Packard model 5890 Series II gas liquid chromatography (GC) equipped with a Thames Rtx-225 capillary column $(0.32 \mathrm{~mm} \times 30 \mathrm{~m})$ and a Flame Ionisation Detector (FID). The carrier gas was helium at a flow rate of $3 \mathrm{ml} \min ^{-1}$. The temperature programme used was $55^{\circ} \mathrm{C}(2 \mathrm{~min}),+4.5^{\circ} \mathrm{C} \min ^{-1}(1.9 \mathrm{~min}), 140^{\circ} \mathrm{C}(2 \mathrm{~min}),+2^{\circ} \mathrm{C} \min ^{-1}(35 \mathrm{~min}), 210^{\circ} \mathrm{C}(40 \mathrm{~min})$. The FID signal was used to measure areas, which were integrated using a HP 3365 chemstation software. Samples were then analysed on an identical GC connected to a Fisons Analytical Trio IS mass spectrometer. The EI (electron ionization) spectra, were obtained using a source temperature of $200^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and an ionisation potential of $60 \mathrm{eV}$.

Acetan in the sodium salt form after CTAB precipitation, was converted to the $\mathrm{Bu}_{4} \mathrm{~N}^{+}$ salt by passing an aqueous $(0.1 \%)$ solution down a column of DOWEX 50W-X8 $(\mathrm{H}^{+})$ ion exchange resin followed by neutralisation with tetrabutylammonium hydroxide. Xanthan was used as a control sample. Xanthan (Keltrol, Kelco-AIL) was converted to the $\mathrm{Bu}_{4} \mathrm{~N}^{+}$ salt in a similar manner. Samples were freeze dried, then over $\mathrm{P}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{5}$ in vacuo overnight. Mild methylation was accomplished using the method of Prehm [12] but with some modifications. Five milligrams of polysaccharide ($\mathrm{Bu}_{4} \mathrm{~N}^{+}$ salt) was suspended in $1 \mathrm{ml}$ trimethyl phosphate (vacuum distilled over anhydrous $\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$) by sonication at $50^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for $2 \mathrm{~h}$. To this was added $300 \mu \mathrm{l}$ of $2,6$ di-tert-butyl pyridine and $100 \mu \mathrm{l}$ of methyl trifluoromethanesulphonate. After heating under argon at $50^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for $4 \mathrm{~h}$, the mixture was allowed to stand at $20^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for $14$ days. Samples were then diluted with $5 \mathrm{ml}$ water, just clarified with $2 \mathrm{M} \mathrm{HCl}$, dialysed against water and evaporated to dryness.

Basic methylation was carried out using the Ciucanu and Kerek method [13] but allowing the powered $\mathrm{NaOH}$ to react for $3 \mathrm{~h}$ by sonication under argon, before adding iodomethane [10,14]. All methylated polysaccharides were dried over $\mathrm{P}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{5}$ and reduced with $\mathrm{LiAlD}_{4}(40 \mathrm{mg})$ in THF at $64^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for $4 \mathrm{~h}[10]$. After treatment with ethanol, water and $1 \mathrm{M} \mathrm{H}_{3} \mathrm{PO}_{4}$ (to pH $5.5$ ), the filtrate and $\mathrm{CHCl}_{3}-\mathrm{MeOH}$ washings were dried down, then hydrolysed with TFA [15] and converted to partially methylated alditol acetates (PMAAs) by reduction with $\mathrm{NaBD}_{4}$ and acetylation [16]. PMAAs were identified by their retention times and EI mass spectra. Molar ratios were calculated from effective carbon response factors [17].

For NMR studies acetan was examined as a $2 \%$ (w/v) solution in $\mathrm{D}_{2} \mathrm{O}$. ${ }^{1} \mathrm{H}(400 \mathrm{MHz})$ and ${ }^{13} \mathrm{C}(100 \mathrm{MHz})$ NMR spectra were recorded on a JEOL 9X-400 spectrometer at $95^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ with the samples contained in $5 \mathrm{~mm}$ and $10 \mathrm{~mm}$ tubes, respectively. For the temperature dependent studies the spectra were recorded on cooling at $10^{\circ}$ intervals between $25$ and $95^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. Chemical shifts for both nuclei were measured with respect to those of tetramethylsilane (TMS), using dioxane as a secondary reference. Chemical shift $(\delta)$ values of dioxane were taken as $3.74\left({ }^{1} \mathrm{H}\right)$ and $67.4\left({ }^{13} \mathrm{C}\right)$ with respect to TMS.

Samples were de-acetylated by alkali treatment. A $0.25 \%$ (w/v) solution of the polysaccharide in distilled

water was prepared by heating an aqueous dispersion to $90^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, titrated to pH 12.5 by addition of 0.1 M NaOH, and left for 16 h at $1^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. The pH was adjusted to pH 8.5 by addition of 0.1 M HCl, the solution was dialysed against distilled water, and the polysaccharide freeze dried.

### 3. Results and discussion

#### 3.1. Structural Studies

The ${}^{1} \mathrm{H}$ NMR spectrum of acetan indicates that there is a total of about 1.5 $O$-acetyl groups per repeat unit, and that these groups are equally distributed between two different localities. The $O$-acetyl methyl protons give two signals at 2.16 ppm and the level of acetylation is determined by integration of these signals relative to the methyl resonance of the rhamnose ring.

Comparison of the ${}^{13} \mathrm{C}$ NMR spectra of native and deacetylated acetan (Fig. 2) shows that there are obvious differences in that the signals from the acetyl groups at $\delta 21.1$ ppm (methyl) and at $\delta 17.4$ ppm (carbonyl) have disappeared in Fig. 2b. There are also clear differences in the region (60–65 ppm) associated with the C6 resonances of the sugar rings. Signals at 64.6 and 63.4 ppm (marked * in Fig. 2a) disappeared on deacetylation (Fig. 2b). There is an increase in the intensity of the signal at 61.7 ppm and a new signal appears at 60.7 ppm (Fig. 2b). This implies that the

$O$-acetyl groups are located at the C6 positions in two of the sugar units. From inspection of the structure 2 (Fig. 1) it is clear that the $O$-acetyl groups must be located on rings A, B or C since these are the only residues with free $\mathrm{CH}_{2} \mathrm{OH}$ groups.

The chromatograms obtained after basic methylation (Fig. 3a) and mild methylation (Fig. 3b) confirm the recent structural studies on the non-carbohydrate substitution of xanthan [18]. The peaks in the chromatograms following basic methylation (Fig. 3a) correspond to the presence of (1,4)Glc, (1,3,4)Glc, (1,2)Man, (1,4)GlcA and $t$-Man. The additional peak corresponds to (1,46)Man which arises due to partial substitution of $t$-Man residues (known to be pyruvate ketal) at the 4,6 positions. After mild methylation (Fig. 3b) the proportion of $t$-Man and (1,2)Man had decreased and three new products (1,2,6)Man, (1,6)Man and (1,2,3,4)Glc appeared. The peaks for (1,2,6)Man and (1,6)Man confirm the reported [18] base-labile substitution of $O$-acetyl groups at the C6 position of the (1,2)Man and $t$-Man residues of xanthan. The appearance of small amounts of (1,2,3,4,6)Glc indicate selective failure to methylate at the C2 position as would be expected for steric hindrance at the branched Glc residue. These studies validate the use of comparative methylation methods for locating $O$-acetyl substituents in xanthan-like polysaccharides.

Chromatograms obtained after basic methylation (Fig. 4a) and mild methylation (Fig. 4b) of acetan, when combined with the information obtained from

NMR, permit identification of the sites of acetylation. Basic methylation reveals the presence of the expected residues of (1,4)Glc, (1,3,4)Glc, (1,2)Man, (1,4)GlcA, (1,6)Glc and *t*-Rha. Mild methylation (Fig. 4b) should result in two additional peaks identifying the sites of acetylation. In fact three new peaks were observed corresponding to (1,2,6)Man, (1,3,4,6)Glc and (1,2,3,4,6)Glc accompanied by a corresponding reduction in (1,2)Man and (1,3,4)Glc peaks. The first two peaks, together with the NMR data, suggest that partial acetylation of acetan occurs at C6 on the branched (1,3,4)Glc and the (1,2)Man residues. The latter site is the same as that found in xanthan [18]. However, acetan contains an additional acetylation site on the acetan backbone. These results confirm the suggestions made on the basis of 2D NMR studies [5]. The additional peak observed at (1,2,3,4,6)Glc has to be attributed to undermethylation at the (1,3,4)Glc residues due to steric crowding arising from the branching and acetylation of this residue. This peak could not arise from general polymer insolubility and consequent universal undermethylation because there are no corresponding undermethylation peaks from Man, Rha and GlcA residues. This specific undermethylation of the (1,3,4)Glc parallels the effect reported above for xanthan samples.

water. As reported previously [6], there is clear evidence of a sharp conformational transition on heating and cooling. By analogy with xanthan, which has been studied extensively [19,20,21] the conformation at low temperature is likely to be the 5-fold helical structure identified by X-ray diffraction [1,6,7] and imaged by AFM [9]. The high temperature form is considered to be a disordered ‘coil’ structure. The transition is fully reversible, with no detectable thermal hysteresis between the optical rotation values recorded on heating and cooling.

As the polymer concentration is increased the transition moves to progressively higher temperatures. This could be a simple mass-action effect, with increasing concentrations promoting formation of an intermolecular ordered structure. Normally, however, the concentration dependence of conformational ordering in biopolymer systems is vanishingly small [27]. Initial association of the participating strands to form a helix nucleus is of course concentration dependent, but subsequent growth of the helix structure is controlled by the equilibrium constant between the ordered and disordered states, which is independent of the total concentration of polymer present [23]. As the length of the ordered structure increases the influence of the nucleation step decreases and, in the limit of infinite chain length, the ordering process approximates to a phase change. Thus, for example, preparations of segmented iota carrageenan show the concentration dependence anticipated for the conversion of two ‘coils’ into a coaxial double helix [24], but for the intact polymer the concentration dependence is undetectable [25].

A more likely alternative explanation for the changes in temperature course of the optical curves shown in Fig. 5 is that they arise from changes in counterion concentration on dilution. Conversion of a polyelectrolyte into the ordered form involves bringing charged groups into closer proximity and is facilitated by ionic screening. Addition of extraneous salt raises the melting temperature of the helix and sharpens the helix-coil transition [23,26]. Increasing the polymer concentration effectively increases the ionic screening thus raising the transition temperature, even

in the absence of any direct dependence on the concentration of the polymer itself.

The temperature course of the conformational change was derived from the experimental plots of optical rotation by the following procedure. The linear regions at high and low temperatures were extrapolated into the temperature range of the transition, and the proportion of residues in the ordered state (helix fraction, fₕ) was determined. From a plot of fₕ-T the transition temperature Tₘ at fₕ = 0.5 was determined (Table 1). These transition temperatures are higher than those reported previously [6]. This discrepancy has been found to be due to the presence of small amounts of NaCl in the acetan samples following the preparation procedure. The presence of this low level of salt also explains the anomalous behaviour of a range of physical chemical parameters reported in a preliminary study of the effect of added salt on the properties of acetan [27].

The circular dichroism spectrum of ordered acetan has a trough at ~220 nm and a peak at ~202 nm with approximate molar ellipticities of 400 and 2000 deg cm² dmol⁻¹, respectively (Fig. 6). De-acetylation gives an overall shift to more positive ellipticities, eliminating the negative band and increasing the magnitude of the positive band (by ~75%). A similar positive shift in circular dichroism on deacetylation was observed for xanthan [19]. Thus it is reasonable to assign the negative band to the O-acetyl substituents. The difference spectrum is Gaussian, consistent with it arising from a single electronic transition. Upon heating marked changes in circular dichroism are observed [6]. The net contribution of the bands at 220 and 202 nm to the optical rotation change observed on heating is positive. This is similar to what has been observed for xanthan [19]. By analogy with the interpretation of data on xanthan the optical rotation change on heating is considered to be dominated by changes in the vacuum ultra-violet circular dichorism bands associated with the polymer backbone due to the order-disorder transition. The changes in near-UV visible circular dichroism spectra will then be attributed to changes in the environment of the carbonyl and acetate groups possibly due to

folding of the sidechain down onto the ordered helical structure at low temperatures.

As shown in Fig. 7 the conformational changes detected by optical rotation can also be monitored by DSC giving endothermic changes on heating and exothermic changes on cooling. As found for the optical rotation data the transition temperatures move to progressively higher temperatures with increasing polymer concentration (Table 1). At each concentration the \( T_{\mathrm{m}} \) values obtained from DSC heating scans are higher than those obtained from the cooling scans (Table 1). However, when allowance is made for the thermal lag associated with the finite heating and cooling rates, the results show satisfactory convergence to a single value (Fig. 8). Although the procedure illustrated in Fig. 8 is the most reliable method of deriving \( T_{\mathrm{m}} \) values from DSC, approximate values can be obtained by averaging

the apparent midpoint temperatures obtained on heating and cooling at finite rates. As shown in Table 1 the resulting values are in good agreement with those obtained by optical rotation.

The supposition that the transitions monitored by optical rotation, circular dichroism and DSC arise from the conversion of acetan from disordered ‘coil’ to an ordered helix on cooling has been tested by obtaining NMR spectra for acetan in D₂O over the temperature range 25–95°C. Data were recorded on cooling. Similar types of experiments have been carried out for xanthan [19,28].

The NMR peak width is inversely related to the spin-spin relaxation time (\( T_{2} \)), which is itself inversely related to the correlation time for molecular motion. Disordered polysaccharide chains have sufficient localised mobility to give peaks only slightly broader than

those of small molecules in solution. On conversion to  
a rigid ordered structure, however, the associated re-  
duction in \( T_2 \) causes extreme line broadening, so that  
the high-resolution spectrum merges with the baseline  
and becomes undetectable. Thus the temperature de-  
pendent changes observed for acetan (Figs. 9 and 10)  
provide evidence for conformational ordering on cool-  
ing. NMR also provides an additional method for  
monitoring the progress of conformational change, by  
measuring the apparent intensity of specific resonances  
as a function of temperature. Certain peak assignments  
for acetan [5] are marked on the high-temperature  
spectra in Figs. 9 and 10. The \({}^{1}\)H NMR resonances at  
1.3 ppm and 2.2 ppm, arising from the methyl protons  
of, respectively the terminal rhamnose residues and the  
\( O \)-acetyl substituents, are particularly well resolved  
from other signals, and can therefore be quantified  
accurately. The temperature-dependence of their inte-

grated intensity is shown in Fig. 11. Both signals dis-  
play a sharp sigmoidal reduction on cooling, centred at  
\(\sim 75^\circ \mathrm{C}\) and with a width comparable to those of the  
transitions detected by optical rotation (Fig. 5) and  
DSC (Fig. 7).

At low temperature, the \( O \)-acetate signal is almost  
entirely suppressed; the small residual peak (Fig. 9) is  
extremely sharp, and is possibly due to a limited  
amount of free acetate liberated by slight hydrolysis at  
high temperature. The rhamnose also remains partially  
visible on cooling, and becomes somewhat broader.  
These studies support the idea that the sidechain is  
immobilised by folding down onto the backbone but  
that the end of the carbohydrate sidechains are not  
fully immobilised on adoption of the ordered structure.  
The \({}^{13}\)C NMR spectra (Fig. 10) point to the same  
conclusion. The only resonances that remain discernible  
at low temperature (as a cluster of peaks centred  
around 72 ppm) all arise [5] from non-anomeric car-  
bons of the two outer residues of the sidechains (\( \alpha \)-L-  
rhamnose and \( \beta \)-D-glucose).
