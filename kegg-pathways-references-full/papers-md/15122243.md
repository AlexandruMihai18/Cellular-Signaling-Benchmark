not surprising that these disorders affect many different organ systems and often lead to psychomotor retardation, failure to thrive, cardiomyopathy and many other symptoms.

Wu and Street *et al.*¹ present a new type of CDG, number 16. It is, however, not just another one of these disorders; its effects appear to extend far beyond glycosylation.

The authors describe two siblings who both died within the first 3 months of life. Blood tests revealed abnormal glycosylation in a serum protein used to screen for CDG. Next, the authors examined patient fibroblasts and found a small but consistent increase in the lectin-column binding of labeled glycopeptides isolated from one patient's cells. Further tests revealed multiple abnormalities in the activities of various sugar nucleotide transporters and glycosyltransferases.

Homing in on the underlying abnormality, the authors found that a glycosyltransferase normally localized to the Golgi did not reach that location with normal kinetics. As has been often the case in the history of CDG, a similar phenotype found in a well-characterized glycosylation-deficient Chinese Hamster ovary (CHO) cell line led the way to the discovery of the primary defect. It involves not another enzyme or transporter that directly regulates glycosylation, but rather a defect of a Golgi protein, COG7.

Like clathrin coats or adaptor proteins, proteins in the COG family are peripherally attached Golgi coat proteins. The conserved oligomeric Golgi (COG) complex is a bilobed, heter-octameric protein complex⁴ (Fig. 1) with multiple functions. The complex is involved in the retention of Golgi resident proteins, control of retrograde Golgi to ER transport and membrane trafficking, intra-Golgi transport, and glycosylation.

COG1 and COG2, the first identified subunits, were first examined in glycosylation-deficient CHO mutant cells lines. The disruption of the COG complex in these cells leads to multiple glycosylation abnormalities⁵ and numerous morphological and functional defects, such as dilated Golgi cisternae. Resident Golgi proteins are mislocalized to the endoplasmic reticulum, and show increased degradation.

Eleven of the 15 types of CDG discovered so far have been found by investigating the N-glycosylation of proteins, revealing an abnormal glycan structure, or reduced amounts of the glycan, traceable to defects

in glycan synthesis (CDG-I). Only four types of CDG affect the processing of the glycan after its transfer to the protein (CDG-II). This imbalance is mostly due to the fact that many alterations in CDG patients suspected to have CDG-II have turned out to be secondary to an unknown primary defect. The new discovery¹ ushers in a new era of research, as it is the first to implicate a molecular defect outside of the glycosylation machinery.

In a field where the nomenclature is still in flux, the currently chosen nomenclature of COG7 deficiency as CDG-He is, as the authors point out, not optimal. COG7 deficiency is not just another member in the rapidly growing group of congenital glycosylation disorders; it is the first member in a completely new class. In COG7 deficiency, the alteration of glycosylation is secondary to the alteration of a Golgi protein not primarily involved in glycosylation.

Analysis of COG-deficient CHO cells, for instance, suggests that the glycosylation abnormalities result from the mislocalization of resident Golgi enzymes and transporters involved in glycosylation; proteins not involved in glycosylation are also mislocalized⁶. It is likely that further analysis of COG7-deficient cells will show a similar picture.

**Arming the osteoclast**

Roland Baron

Signaling through costimulatory receptors classically occurs in cells of the immune system. Now the distinction between immune cells and osteoclasts, bone resorbing cells, begins to blur. Osteoclasts need costimulatory signals too.

Inflammation and bone resorption often go hand in hand, a fact evident in conditions such as joint destruction in rheumatoid arthritis or periodontal disease. Osteoclasts, the bone-resorbing cells of the organism, also share several features with macrophages and dendritic cells. Osteoclasts are derived from hematopoietic stem cells within the macrophage lineage, and they respond to several interleukins produced by activated T cells¹,². These include receptor activator of NFkB ligand (RANKL) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF), which stimulate osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption.

In 15 April issue of *Nature*, Koga and Inui *et al.*³ tighten the link between bone resorption and the immune system. The authors show that cells of the immune system and osteoclasts share a requirement for costimulatory signals that are mediated by immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs). In osteoclasts, this costimulation is needed for RANKL-induced differentiation and bone resorption.

Figure 1 Costimulatory ITAM-based signaling pathways mediate osteoclast differentiation. RANK is the central receptor regulating osteoclast differentiation. Upon binding of its ligand (RANKL), several signaling cascades are activated: some converge on a transcription factor, NFATc1, whose calcium-dependent activation is required for osteoclast differentiation. Koga et al. show that the required calcium changes are induced by the activation of costimulatory pathways (mediated by DAP12 or FcRγ, and their co-receptors, TREM2 and OSCAR). Upon binding of yet unidentified ligands, and RANKL to RANK, ITAM motifs are tyrosine phosphorylated. This phosphorylation recruits the tyrosine kinases ZAP70 or SYK, leading to activation of PLCγ and calcium oscillations which activate NFATc1, allowing osteoclast differentiation. The sources of these various ligands include osteoblasts, the bone-forming cell, and activated T cells. Signaling through TNF receptors (members of the RANK family) also activates osteoclasts. Estrogen may negatively regulate the production of these activators and coactivators by osteoblasts and T cells, possibly explaining in part why estrogen deprivation after menopause increases bone resorption and leads to osteoporosis. Production of the same factors by activated T cells may in part explain the local bone resorption associated with inflammation (rheumatoid arthritis, periodontal disease) or with tumors (osteolytic bone metastasis).

The new study emerges against a backdrop of other recent studies that have linked immune regulation and bone resorption. For instance, T cells and antigen-presenting cells, through interferons, regulate osteoclastogenesis and participate in bone loss due to estrogen deficiency in mice and possibly osteoporosis in humans. Others have found that mutations in genes encoding a costimulatory complex, containing DNAX-activation protein 12 (DAP12) and triggering receptors expressed on myeloid cells (TREM), cause Nasu-Hakola syndrome—a genetic disease associated with spontaneous fractures, bone cysts and loss of brain white matter in humans.

It was the link between DAP12, TREM and bone defects that caught the eye of Koga et al. DAP12 is a transmembrane adaptor protein that forms a complex with several cell surface proteins, including members of the TREM immunoglobulin superfamily. In response to an unidentified TREM ligand, DAP12 is phosphorylated on its cytoplasmic tail on an ITAM motif. This phosphorylation initiates a signaling cascade that in myeloid and in dendritic cells promotes activation and migration, and leads to T-cell activation.

Osteoclast differentiation and function is altered in people with Nasu-Hakola syndrome, as a result of mutations in DAP12 or TREM2 (refs. 7,8). Mice deficient in DAP12 also do not fare well; they have moderate osteopetrosis (bone thickening) and their osteoclasts do not respond to RANKL. Thus, these two costimulatory receptors of immune stimuli, TREM and DAP12, clearly mediate osteoclast differentiation—but how?

Koga et al. took on this question. The authors demonstrated that the ITAM motif on DAP12 is required for osteoclast differentiation. But they could bypass this requirement by the addition of osteoblasts (bone-forming cells) to the cultures. Adding osteoblasts allowed RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation, suggesting that these cells provide a ligand which activates a pathway that can compensate for the absence of DAP12.

What is this compensatory pathway? A clue came from previous findings that echoed those of Koga et al. In osteoclasts, Kim et al. had shown that RANKL induces another member of the immunoglobulin superfamily (osteoclast associated receptor, OSCAR). The ligand for OSCAR is not known, but it can—like the TREM ligand—be provided by osteoblasts. Koga et al. now show that OSCAR associates with an adaptor protein (FcReceptor γ) that—like DAP12—contains an ITAM motif and is essential in immune responses (Fig. 1). The researchers were quickly homing in on two ITAM-mediated costimulatory pathways that seemed to work together to promote osteoclast differentiation.

The clincher came when they knocked out both pathways. Mice deficient in both pathways had skeletal phenotypes much more severe than mice lacking either pathway individually, with severe osteoclast impairment and osteopetrosis (Fig. 2). RANKL clearly does not act alone any longer: it works with two costimulatory pathways to promote osteoclast differentiation. The osteoclast is beginning to look even more like an immune cell.

NEWS AND VIEWS

![Figure 2](#fig2) Costimulation of osteoclasts. Mice deficient in one of two costimulatory signaling pathways show mild osteopetrosis (bone thickening), and mice deficient for both pathways have severe osteopetrosis. (a) Bone from a wild-type mouse, (b) a mouse deficient in one pathway ($DAP12^{-/-}$), and (c) double-knockout mouse ($DAP12^{-/-}FcR\gamma^{-/-}$). The bone marrow cavity is absent in the double knock-out.

Koga *et al.* traced some of the events that occur downstream of ITAM-mediated signaling (Fig. 1), fingering PLC$\gamma$ and calcium as critical mediators that relay signals to the nucleus through activation of the transcription factor NFATc1 (Fig. 1), an event required for osteoclast differentiation [11]. Interestingly, osteoclastogenesis is markedly enhanced in mice lacking the tyrosine phosphatases SHP-1 (ref. 12) or SHIP-1 (ref. 13), both of which inhibit ITAM signaling in the immune system.

The pathophysiological link to Nasu-Hakola syndrome, however, is not yet clear, since most of the skeletal features in affected individuals suggest that locally increased bone resorption is also occurring despite defective osteoclasts, generating osteoporotic features rather than an osteopetrotic phenotype [8]. This apparent paradox suggests that additional signaling alterations in people with DAP12 or TREM2 null mutations provide compensating activation signals *in vivo*.

The most exciting and challenging next steps will be to identify the osteoblast-derived costimulating ligand or ligands and to explore whether mice with defects in other components of ITAM-induced signaling (such as the tyrosine kinases Syk or Zap70) have osteopetrotic features. Another question is whether ITAM-mediated signaling occurs in other regulatory pathways in the osteoclast, or in other cells of the hematopoietic and immune systems capable of indirect osteoclast regulation. In the context of normal bone remodeling or systemic alterations of the skeleton, the sources of the yet-unidentified ligands seem to be osteoblasts or stromal cells in the bone marrow [10]. This provides yet another regulatory link between bone formation and resorption, attempting to ensure coordinated bone remodeling and homeostasis of the skeleton.

However, other cellular sources in the hematopoietic bone marrow environment cannot be excluded as ligand sources. Cells of the immune system, in the context of inflammation, bone metastasis and estrogen-deprived bone marrow, may well also provide co-activators of osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption, tipping the balance toward local or systemic bone loss.

The finding that ITAM-activating factors, which activate macrophages, NK cells, APCs and T-cells, also participate in the activation of bone resorption suggest that the osteoclast may not just be a bystander but an integral component of the immune and inflammatory responses. Indeed, many pro-inflammatory proteins (IL1, IL6, TNF, RANKL and the interferons for instance), are also induced by signaling pathways requiring ITAM-dependent costimulation and regulate osteoclast function. These pro-inflammatory proteins are thought to participate not only in inflammation-linked bone resorption but also in the bone loss associated with estrogen deprivation [5,6].

Thus, widespread diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, periodontal disease or osteoporosis may therefore have in common not only an increase in osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption but also the key involvement of cells and signaling mechanisms derived from the immune system. The study of Kago *et al.* has made this link tighter.

### Tangling with hypothermia

**Jesús Avila & Javier Díaz-Nido**

Hypothermia resulting from impaired glucose metabolism may be one of the factors that contribute to hyperphosphorylation of the protein tau and subsequent neuronal dysfunction.

Aging is a major risk factor for the development of Alzheimer disease, the most prevalent cause of dementia in the elderly [1]. With age, hyperphosphorylated tau accumulates and aggregates into neurofibrillary tangles in the brains of people with AD and other neurological disorders referred to as tauopathies. Whereas normal tau stabilizes the neuronal cytoskeleton, hyperphosphorylated tau may disrupt microtubules and interfere with intraneuronal organelle transport [2], ultimately leading to dysfunction of synapses, degeneration of neurons and cognitive impairment. There is therefore great interest in unraveling the mechanisms that control tau phosphorylation.

In a study in the March 10 issue of the *Journal of Neuroscience*, Planell and colleagues [3] examine the relationship between
