Th17 cells are a subset of T helper cells that have been recently found to play important functions in host defense and the pathogenesis of various human autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Th17 cells produce IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-22, and IL-21, of which IL-17A and IL-17F mediate many of the downstream pathologic functions of these cells. IL-17A and IL-17F signal through IL-17RA and IL-17RC heterodimeric receptors that are mainly expressed on tissue epithelial cells and fibroblasts. While IL-17A and IL-17F are important for host defense against many extracellular pathogens, they can also cause excessive tissue damage and exacerbate proinflammatory responses during autoimmunity. The IL-17 pathway, therefore, is a primary therapeutic target downstream of Th17 cells.

## Introduction

Although the classical model of Th1/Th2 differentiation was fundamental for shaping our understanding of the adaptive immune response, certain inconsistencies remained. Initially, Th2 cells had been proposed to mediate atopic diseases and asthma, while Th1 cells played important pathogenic functions in tissue-disruptive autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and multiple sclerosis (MS). This premise, however, has been challenged by data from various preclinical models, especially experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model for human MS. Based on the association of IFNγ with autoimmune disease and the resistance to EAE in STAT4-deficient mice, it was predicted that blocking Th1 differentiation and IFNγ production would be protective in a model of autoimmune disease. However, the opposite was true, as a blockade of Th1 differentiation in IL-12R2-deficient mice resulted in more severe EAE. A major step toward resolving this inconsistency was the discovery, by Cua et al., that the cytokine IL-23, consisting of the IL-12p40 subunit and a p19 subunit, was responsible for the development of EAE. An IL-23-responsive population of CD4+T cells was described that ultimately became known as Th17 cells due to their production of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-17A. In addition to the hallmark cytokine IL-17, Th17 cells also preferentially secrete IL-17F, IL-21, IL-22, and, in humans, IL-26. It was quickly recognized that Th17 cells, especially their downstream cytokines, mediate major pathogenic functions not only in EAE but also in many other autoimmune diseases, such as RA, IBD, and psoriasis.

IL-17A is the prototypic member of the IL-17 family, which comprises six members: IL-17A through F. IL-17F isoforms 1 and 2 (ML-1) have the highest degree of homology with IL-17A (55% and 40%, respectively), while IL-17E is the most distant (17%). The IL-17 receptor (IL-17RA), a type I transmembrane protein with a ubiquitous cell and tissue distribution, has no homology with any known cytokine receptor family. Four additional IL-17-like receptors (IL-17RB-E) have been identified through database mining and sequence comparison. The ligand-receptor relationship between the IL-17 cytokine and receptor families has been largely mapped out but not completely solved (Table 1). IL-17A and IL-17F are by far the best-studied

cytokines in the family. The IL-17 pathway is involved in the pathogenesis of many human autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, including RA, MS, IBD, and psoriasis. The IL-17 pathway mediates many of the key tissue-disruptive processes in these diseases, for example bone and cartilage erosion in RA and demyelination in MS. Given the important role of Th17 cells and the IL-17 pathway in various human diseases, significant efforts have been undertaken in recent years to understand the regulation of Th17 development, the production of IL-17, cellular functions and signaling transduction of the IL-17 pathway, and biological functions of the IL-17 pathway in various preclinical models. In parallel, novel therapeutic strategies that target Th17 cells and IL-17 pathways have been tested in human diseases.

IL-17A and IL-17F overview

The cDNA of interleukin-17A (IL-17A) was first cloned in 1993 and named CTLA-8.<sup>10</sup> It was not until 1995 that CTLA-8 was recognized as a cytokine and designated as IL-17. IL-17 shares 57% identity with the HSV 13 gene from *Herpesvirus saimiri*.<sup>11</sup>

IL-17 receptor A (IL-17RA) was cloned based on its ability to bind HSV 13 and IL-17.<sup>11</sup> Both IL-17 and IL-17RA show little homology to other known cytokines or cytokine receptors, thus defining a novel cytokine and receptor family. IL-17 was later renamed IL-17A after the discovery of five other family members, IL-17B to IL-17F, that share similarity in cDNA and protein sequences to IL-17A.

Among the six family members, IL-17A and IL-17F are the most closely related. IL-17F shares 50% amino acid identity with IL-17A but 16–30% with other family members. In mice, genes expressing

IL-17A and IL-17F are located “head-to-head” adjacently to each other. They share conserved noncoding sequences in the junction area, suggesting potential coordinated transcriptional regulation. This hypothesis is supported by chromatin remodeling in the IL-17A/IL-17F gene locus during T cell differentiation.<sup>12</sup> However, there is clearly a difference in the expression pattern of IL-17A and IL-17F.<sup>13</sup>

Both IL-17A and IL-17F were initially described as homodimers.<sup>11, 14, 15</sup> Crystal structure of the IL-17F/F homodimer revealed two intrapeptide and one interpeptide disulfide-bonds forming a “cysteine knot”-like structure similar to that found in neurotrophins such as NGF.<sup>16</sup> The IL-17A homodimer assumes a similar tertiary structure.<sup>17</sup> In addition to homodimers, IL-17A and IL-17F can also form a heterodimer. In fact, T cells have been reported to produce higher levels of IL-17A/F heterodimer upon activation.<sup>18, 19</sup> Mass spectrometry analysis of the IL17A/F heterodimer demonstrated two interdimer disulfide-bonds.<sup>19</sup>

Th17 cells and other cellular sources of IL-17

IL-17A and IL-17F are produced by a wide range of cell types, including cells of both the adaptive and innate immune system. The diversity of cellular sources of IL-17 has been appreciated only recently, as the initial characterization of IL-17 focused on a subset of CD4<sup>+</sup>T helper cells, Th17 cells.

Although IL-23 induces IL-17 production from memory CD4<sup>+</sup>T cells in vitro,<sup>5</sup> IL-23 cannot drive Th17 differentiation from naive T cells, as naive T cells do not express the IL-23R, and activation in the presence of IL-23 alone does not induce IL-17 production.<sup>20</sup> Work by the Kuchroo, Weaver, and
The IL-17 pathway as a major therapeutic target in autoimmune diseases

Hu *et al.*

Stockinger labs demonstrated murine Th17 differentiation could be induced by IL-6 and TGF-β.²⁰⁻²² The expression of IL-23R on CD4⁺ T cells is increased following treatment with TGF-β²¹ or IL-6,²³ suggesting that IL-23 has a role in the maintenance and survival of fully differentiated Th17 cells.

While investigating the requirement for IL-6 signaling in Th17 development, Korn *et al.* observed that IL-6-deficient mice did not develop Th17 cells, but instead were dominated by regulatory T cells.²⁴ However, following deletion of regulatory T cells, Th17 cells developed in IL-6-deficient mice, suggesting that additional signals could replace IL-6.²⁴ This was supported by Zhou *et al.*, who reported an autocrine loop wherein IL-6 induced IL-21, which then increased IL-21 and IL-23R expression.²⁵

Initial investigations in the human system offered conflicting data as to whether Th17 differentiation was fundamentally different than in the mouse. The requirement for TGF-β for human Th17 cells was initially questioned because data differed between labs based on experimental method and protocol, with some groups suggesting it to be unnecessary.²⁶,²⁷ Experiments performed following stringent purification of naive T cells and carefully controlling the use of serum in the media (as a source of TGF-β) resolved this issue. Manel *et al.* and Volpe *et al.* suggested that TGF-β, in the presence of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-23, promoted efficient human Th17 differentiation *ex vivo*.²⁸,²⁹

The contribution of TGF-β to Th17 differentiation was initially viewed with some surprise, as TGF-β had been previously appreciated as an immunosuppressive molecule and is required for the development of induced T regulatory cells (Treg cells).³⁰,³¹ TGF-β signaling contributes to the reciprocal regulation of Treg and Th17 development.³² Originally proposed to contribute to the induction of RORγt during Th17 differentiation, it has now been suggested that the function of TGF-β is to block commitment to other lineages. In mice lacking STAT6 and T-bet (thus blocking Th1 and Th2 differentiation), IL-6 alone was sufficient for Th17 differentiation.³³ In addition, TGF-β has been suggested to maintain lineage commitment in IL-17-producing cells, as in the absence of TGF-β Th17 cells convert to a Th1 phenotype, suggesting plasticity.³⁴

A balance exists between Th17 and Treg cell development *in vivo*, and factors that promote Treg development appear to block the Th17 lineage. IL-2, a cytokine known to promote Treg cell development and expansion, appears to be a negative regulator of Th17 development.³⁵ STAT5-deficient mice lacked Treg cells but had increased numbers of Th17 cells, suggesting that IL-2 constrains Th17 development.³⁵ Recent work has suggested that the adapter molecule tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), a downstream component of TGF-β signaling, contributes to the IL-2-induced blockade in Th17 development.³⁶ Quintana *et al.* have suggested that stimulation through the Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) can shift the immune response toward either Th17 or Treg development, depending on the AHR ligand used.³⁷ IL-27 also appears to inhibit Th17 development, and in IL-27-deficient mice IL-17 associated pathology, such as in EAE, is more severe.³⁸,³⁹ IL-27 blocks RORC expression in a STAT1-dependent fashion, thus inhibiting Th17 lineage commitment.⁴⁰

The transcription factor RORγt (RORC in human) is expressed by Th17 cells, as well as other IL-17-producing cell types, and is considered the master regulator of Th17 development. The activity and function of RORγt is modulated by additional signals and transcription factors. The cytokine promoters of Th17 differentiation, IL-6, IL-21, and IL-23, all induce STAT3 activation, and STAT3 binds directly to the IL-17 and IL-21 promoters, thus cooperating with RORγt.²³,²⁵ Additionally, interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4) is required for Th17 development, and appears to mediate the early effects of IL-1 signaling during Th17 differentiation.⁴¹,⁴² RUNX1, a transcription factor also associated with the function of FOXP3, interacts with RORγt and induces optimal RORγt expression and IL-17 production in Th17 cells, basically “fine-tuning” the Th17 program.⁴³

The transcription factor BATF appears to be a nonredundant requirement for Th17 development. BATF forms heterodimers with JUN, and was considered to be an AP repressor. However, Schraml *et al.* have demonstrated that BATF-deficient mice have normal Th1 and Th2 development but fail to develop Th17 cells, resulting in decreased susceptibility to EAE.⁴⁴ BATF-deficient cells do not express RORγt or IL-21 in response to Th17 differentiation

cues, and over expression of RORγt does not restore IL-17 expression. Schraml *et al.* suggest that BATF binds to the IL-17, IL-21, and IL-22 promoters to enable IL-17 production.⁴⁴

Recent work from Okamoto *et al.* has suggested that normal Th17 development requires an additional transcription factor, IkBζ.⁴⁵ The lack of IkBζ results in defective Th17 development and resistance to EAE.⁴⁵ Although incapable of inducing Th17 differentiation alone, IkBζ cooperates with RORγt and enhances IL-17 expression by binding to the regulatory region of the IL-17 gene.⁴⁵ Thus it appears that regulation of the Th17 program is complex, and future research will likely identify additional regulatory factors.

Although attention has focused largely on Th17 cells, CD4⁺ T cells are not the only cellular source of IL-17. As demonstrated by Martin *et al.*, γδ T cells are an important source of IL-17 in the early response to infection. A subpopulation of γδ T cells express CCR6 and the IL-23R, TLR1, TLR2, and Dectin 1, thus enabling response to bacterial ligands.⁴⁶ Maximal IL-17 production was achieved by a synergistic interaction between TLR2 and IL-23 stimulation, thus positioning CCR6⁺ γδ T cells as an early responder cells.⁴⁶ As with Th17 cells, γδ T cells can also contribute to inflammatory pathology. In a murine model of EAE Sutton *et al.* demonstrated that γδ T cells infiltrate the CNS and contribute to the development of EAE.⁴⁷ Also, γδ T cells respond to stimulation with pro-inflammatory stimuli IL-23 and IL-1β, as do Th17 cells, suggesting similar regulation.⁴⁷ Further, Sutton *et al.* offer the intriguing suggestion that IL-17 produced by γδ T cells promotes IL-17 production from CD4⁺ T cells.⁴⁷

Cells of the innate immune system are also sources of IL-17. Recent reports have identified lymphoid tissue inducer (LTi) or LTi-like cells as an innate population of lymphocytes capable of IL-17 production,⁴⁸⁻⁵⁰ and Takatori *et al.* observed that following injection of mice with zymosan, LTi cells were activated and produced IL-17.⁵⁰ Further, recent studies have suggested that mast cells⁵¹ and neutrophils⁵² are significant cellular sources of IL-17. Hueber *et al.* found that the majority of IL-17A⁺ cells in the synovium of RA patients are actually mast cells.⁵¹ In a model of ischemia reperfusion injury, Li *et al.* found that neutrophils are the major source of IL-17 and play a significant role in pathology.⁵² Interestingly,

IL-17A gene homologs were also found in genome of jawless hagfish⁵³ that do not even have a fully functional adaptive immune system. Therefore, IL-17A probably originated from the innate immune system and became associated with the adaptive immune system during evolution. It is also interesting to note that IL-17A and F are not necessarily produced by the same cell.⁵⁴

### IL-17RA and IL-17RC—heteromeric receptor complex

Leukocytes from mice lacking IL-17RA fail to bind IL-17, and antibodies against IL-17RA inhibit the activity of IL-17 on human epithelial cells, indicating that IL-17RA is critical for IL-17 function.⁵⁵,⁵⁶ Interestingly, human IL-17RA failed to reconstitute IL-17 signaling in *Il17ra*-deficient mouse fibroblasts unless paired with human IL-17RC.⁵⁷ Cells deficient in IL-17RC fail to respond to either IL-17A or IL-17F, suggesting that IL-17RC is crucial for the signaling pathway of both IL-17A and IL-17F.⁵⁸

The binding of IL-17A/A, IL-17F/F, and IL-17A/F to their receptors has been extensively studied. *In vitro*, IL-17RA binds to IL-17A/A with high affinity (*K*~d~ = 2.15 × 10⁻⁹), IL-17A/F with medium affinity (*K*~d~ = 2.55 × 10⁻⁸), and IL-17F/F with low affinity (*K*~d~ = 1.74 × 10⁻⁷). However, IL-17RC binds to all three ligands with similar affinity (*K*~d~ = 2.01 × 10⁻⁸, 1.06 × 10⁻⁸, and 1.66 × 10⁻⁸, respectively).⁵⁹ Recent structural analysis has shed light on the dynamics of the heterometric receptor complex in the context of ligand binding. Gel filtration data show that IL-17RA binds to IL-17Fin a 1:2 stoichiometry.⁶⁰ As predicted by computational analysis, crystal structure of IL-17RA revealed two fibronectin III (FN)-like domains (FN1 and FN2) connected by an 18-amino acid linker.⁶⁰ The IL-17RA/IL-17F interface is largely covered by FN1. FN2 in murine IL-17RA is reported to mediate ligand-independent preassembly of IL-17RA homo-oligomer using fluorescence resonance energy transfer techniques.⁶¹ However, no dimerization of human IL-17RA extracellular domain was found.⁶⁰ More interestingly, surface plasmon resonance data indicate that the receptor complex might utilize “two step” binding of the IL-17RA or IL-17RC monomer to the ligand dimer. The conformational changes in the ligand dimer then preferentially “invite” binding of another different receptor subunit but “reject” the same receptor subunit.⁶⁰ These

results are in agreement with coimmunoprecipitation data. There is no pre-association of IL-17RA and IL-17RC on the cell surface when ligand is absent. The receptor complex (IL-17RA/RC) can only be detected when IL-17A is present.⁵⁸

The in vivo responses to the three different IL-17 ligands are determined by many factors in addition to ligand-receptor binding affinity. These factors include receptor availability, receptor assembly, splicing variance, and glycosylation. IL-17RA and IL-17RC have distinct tissue distribution; IL-17RA is expressed ubiquitously on many types of cells including fibroblastic cells, stromal cells, osteoblast cells, epithelial cells, T cells, B cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells,¹¹ while IL-17RC is expressed mostly on nonhemopoietic cells.⁵⁴,⁶² There are few reports of direct IL-17 response by T cells, which is probably due to the lack of IL-17RC expression in T cells.⁵⁴ Most IL-17 signaling studies are done in fibroblasts because they express both IL-17RA and IL-17RC. However, the magnitude of response in most cell-based assays seems to be dictated by the affinity of ligands for IL-17RA (IL-17A/A > IL-17A/F > IL-17F/F). Indeed, when IL-17RC is exogenously overexpressed in mouse embryonic fibro-

blasts, IL-17F/F's potency is greatly enhanced to a level on par with that of IL-17A/A.⁵⁸ IL-17RC gene is also highly regulated by alternative splicing.⁶³ Compared to full length human IL-17RC, some human IL-17RC splice variants (e.g., lacking exon 7 and/or exon 12) have a much lower affinity to both IL-17A and IL-17F.⁶² It is possible, therefore, that the regulation and expression of IL-17RC controls the cellular responses to IL-17A and IL-17F during inflammation.

### IL-17 receptor signaling pathway

Since IL-17RA showed little homology to other cytokine receptors, the understanding of IL-17 receptor signaling is limited (Fig. 1). A PSI-BLAST search using a conserved protein sequence from SEF (similar expression to fibroblast growth factor genes in Danio rerio) revealed a common intracellular signaling motif shared by the IL-17R family members.⁶⁴ This motif is called SEFIR (SEF/IL-17R) because it is homologous to the TIR domain in Toll-like receptor. The function of SEFIR in IL-17RA was confirmed by a classical mutagenesis and reconstitution study in fibroblast cells lacking IL-17RA.⁶⁵ Interestingly, valine 553 outside of the IL-17RA SEFIR
domain is the analogue of proline-712 in murine TLR4. The spontaneous mutation of proline 712 in TLR4 renders mice hyporesponsive to LPS.⁶⁶ Similarly, point mutation of valine 553 to histidine blocks IL-17RA signaling.⁶⁵ Detailed signaling studies have not been done for IL-17RC, though recent studies showed that the SEFIR domain and a downstream C-terminal domain are required for its signaling.⁵⁸,⁶⁷

If the TIR domain is a critical interface between TLR and downstream adaptor proteins, then the SEFIR domain should also serve as a docking site for adaptor proteins. Surprisingly, MyD88 and TRIF, two major adaptor proteins downstream of TLRs, are not required for IL-17RA signaling.⁶⁵ Instead, Act1, an SEFIR domain containing adaptor protein, is directly associated with IL-17RA and required for IL-17 signaling.⁶⁸ The importance of Act1 in IL-17 signaling has been demonstrated by various disease models in the mouse.⁶⁹–⁷¹ Act1 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that mediates the ubiquitination of TRAF6.⁷² It is long accepted that TRAF6, but not TRAF2, is downstream of IL-17RA signaling.⁷³ TRAF6 is a central adaptor protein used by various receptors, including the IL-1R, TLRs, and CD40.⁷⁴–⁷⁶

One of the hallmark features of TRAF6 is activation of NF-κB via the TAK-IKK complex;⁷⁴ it appears that IL-17R uses the same conserved pathway to activate NF-κB.⁷⁷ The SEFIR domain in both IL-17RA and Act1 is required for IL-17-induced NF-κB activation.⁶⁵,⁶⁸ Like the activation of NF-κB by TLR, IL-17 stimulation induces the phosphorylation, degradation, and subsequent up-regulation of IkBa.⁷²,⁷³ As observed by gel shift assay, NF-κB p65 and p50 subunits quickly associated with NF-κB response element upon IL-17 stimulation.⁷⁸,⁷⁹ There is no evidence of processing of other noncanonical NF-κB subunits. Interestingly, IL-17 also induces expression of IkBg,⁸⁰ a positive regulator of NF-κB activation.⁸¹ Recently, additional evidence suggests that IkBg plays an important role in IL-17-induced expression of human β-defensin 2 and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin.⁸²,⁸³

TLR signaling activates C/EBPs,⁸⁴ and C/EBP-δ is linked to persistent target gene transcription.⁸⁵ This feature is also shared by IL-17R signaling. Among all C/EBP family members, only C/EBP-β and C/EBP-δ are transcriptionally up-regulated by IL-17.⁸⁰ The function of these C/EBPs seems redundant to each other because reconstitution of either C/EBP-β or

C/EBP-δ in double knockout cells is able to rescue its function.⁸⁶ The cooperation of NF-κB and C/EBPs can partially explain the synergistic effect of IL-17 and TNF-α. Indeed, both NF-κB and C/EBP binding sites were enriched in the proximal promoter region of a group of IL-17 target genes.⁷⁹ C/EBP-β is not only regulated at the transcriptional level but also at the posttranslational level. IL-17 stimulation of fibroblast cells results in sequential phosphorylation of C/EBP-β threonines 188 and 179 in the RD2 region, which is mediated by ERK and GSK3β.⁸⁷ However, phosphorylation of C/EBP-β down-regulates its transcriptional activity, which could potentially change the dynamics of the transcription activation complex.

Parallel to the TLR pathway, IL-17A also activates the MAPK pathway. Within 30 minutes of IL-17A stimulation, ERK is rapidly phosphorylated and then regulates various downstream signaling components, including NF-κB, C/EBP, and AP1. ERK activation is dependent on the SEFIR domain of IL-17RA intracellular tail, yet,⁶⁵ surprisingly, Act1-deficient fibroblast cells are still able to activate ERK at 24 h. The MAPK pathway has been implicated in regulation of cytokine production via mRNA stability; consistent with this, Act1-deficient fibroblasts fail to stabilize CXCL1 mRNA after IL-17 stimulation. However, TRAF6 is dispensable for this process, indicating that the mRNA stabilization signal is downstream of Act1 but upstream of TRAF6.⁸⁸

### Downstream biological effects of IL-17A

IL-17 downstream targets can be categorized into five major groups: (1) chemokines; (2) pro-inflammatory cytokines and inflammatory mediator related genes; (3) antimicrobial peptides; (4) tissue remodeling genes; and (5) signaling components such as C/EBPβ, C/EBPδ, and IkBg (described previously).

IL-17 target genes are highly enriched for chemokines. CXCL1 (GROα),⁸⁹–⁹¹ CXCL2 (MIP2),⁹² and CXCL5 (LIX)⁷⁸ are the major mediators of the IL-17-induced neutrophil response in host defense and various inflammatory disease models. CXCR3 ligands, namely CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11, are highly regulated by IFN-γ and were previously associated with Th1 response. The IL-17 response contributes to the protective effect of BCG vaccination and induces CXCL9 and CXCL11 production.⁹³ IL-17F alone or in

**combination with IFN-γ can stimulate CXCL10 production in bronchial epithelial cells.** Other CXC chemokines such as CXCL6, CXCL8, and CXCL12 are also regulated by IL-17. CCL2 (MCP1) and CCL20 are among the few CC chemokines up-regulated by IL-17.

IL-17A induces production of other proinflammatory cytokines in various cell types. For example, IL-6 is one of the earliest target genes reported in IL-17A-stimulated fibroblasts. GCSF is another important cytokine that is induced by the IL-17 pathway. GCSF specifically stimulates the proliferation and differentiation of the progenitor cells for granulocytes, such as neutrophils. COX2 and iNOS are two important genes regulating inflammatory mediators such as prostaglandins and nitric oxide. Thus, IL-17 can induce COX2 and iNOS expression in various target cells.

Antimicrobial peptides are important mediators of innate immunity; and IL-17A is a potent inducer of various antimicrobial peptides. For example, Lipocalin 2 (24p3) plays an important role in host defense against E. coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae by limiting bacterial siderophores to bind free iron. In fibroblast cells, IL-17A alone or with TNFα results in quick induction of 24p3 protein. As another example, human β-defensin 2 (hBD2) is an antimicrobial peptide and a chemo-attractant to CCR6+ cells. hBD2 is markedly up-regulated by IL-17A in human airway epithelium and during virus infection. IL-17A together with IL-22 can stimulate S100A9, S100A8, and S100A7 peptide production by primary keratinocyte, and IL-17A-dependent production of β-defensin, S100A8, and S100A9 in vivo has been confirmed by multiple models of infection in mice.

There are abundant data indicating that IL-17A is a potent regulator of bone remodeling. Over-expression of IL-17A in mouse knee joints results in elevated bone erosion in murine collagen-induced arthritis. This could be explained by the loss of balance between RANKL and OPG, critical regulators of osteoclastogenesis. IL-17A also induces expression of MMPs, including MMP1, MMP2, MMP9, and MMP13, which are the major players in extracellular matrix degradation and bone resorption. Mice lacking IL-17RA fail to express MMPs in streptococcal cell wall induced-arthritis and show amelioration of cartilage destruction.

**IL-17 in host defense**

Consistent with the aforementioned cellular functions, IL-17A plays an important role in host defense against pathogen infections. The general consensus is that IL-17A is required for host defense against bacterial infections, especially extracellular bacteria. Il-17ra−/− and Il-17a−/− mice are more susceptible to the extracellular bacterium K. pneumoniae infection in the lungs, in part due to defective GCSF responses and delayed neutrophil recruitment. Neutralization of IL-17A signaling with an IL-17RA:Fc fusion protein has also been shown to abrogate host defense against K. pneumoniae. Studies using single and double knockout mice showed that both IL-17F and IL-17A were required in host defense against mucosal infection by Staphylococcus aureus and Citrobacter rodentium. It was also shown that expression of β-defensin 1, 3, and 4 (but not β-defensin 2, lipocalin 2, S100A8, S100A9, Reg3b, and Reg3g) were markedly impaired in the colons of Il-17f−/−, Il-17a−/−, and Il-17a−/−Il-17f−/− mice on day 14 after C. rodentium infection, suggesting β-defensins induced by IL-17A and IL-17F are important for the host defense against C. rodentium. IL-17A also plays a critical role in intra-abdominal abscess formation in response to the gram-negative bacterium Bacteroides fragilis, as demonstrated by anti-IL-17A antibody neutralization.

The IL-17 pathway also plays a role in host defense against intracellular bacteria. IL-17RA-deficient mice show greater mortality to Salmonella typhimurium, attributable to impaired neutrophil recruitment to the intestinal mucosa; however, these mice are not susceptible to Mycobacterium tuberculosis or Listeria monocytogenes, two intracellular bacteria that require Th1 immunity. IL-17RA-deficient mice are also more susceptible to the intracellular parasitic pathogen Toxoplasma gondii, also due to a defect in neutrophil recruitment.

Likewise, IL-17RA-deficient mice are more susceptible to Candida albicans, likely due to significant impairment and delay of the mobilization of peripheral neutrophils and their influx to infected organs. However, IL-17A can also impair the antifungal activities of neutrophils by negatively regulating IFN-γ-mediated induction of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, which has potent regulatory effects in inflammatory and T cell responses.

### IL-17 in autoimmunity

In addition to its protective roles in host defense against microorganisms, the IL-17A/F pathway is implicated in the development of a variety of autoimmune disease, such as RA, MS, asthma, IBD, and psoriasis.⁹ A large number of preclinical models have demonstrated important roles for IL-17A and IL-17F in the pathogenesis of several autoimmune diseases; expression of IL-17, for example, has been detected in sera and target tissues of patients with various autoimmune diseases. However, emerging data also suggest that IL-17A and IL-17F play different roles in the pathogenesis of some autoimmune diseases.

and destructive mediators that result in inflammation. IL-17A has been shown to induce a variety of inflammatory effector molecules from fibroblast-like synoviocytes, chondrocytes/osteoblasts, and monocytes/macrophages.¹³² Some of these molecules directly participate in local inflammation, while some (such as chemokines) function to recruit neutrophils¹²⁷ and monocytes¹³³ to the RA synovial tissue, which can in turn exacerbate inflammation; IL-17A can indirectly promote osteoclastogenesis by up-regulating RANKL production in osteoblast;¹³⁴ and *in vitro* studies revealed that IL-17A suppresses matrix synthesis by articular chondrocytes through enhancement of NO production.¹³⁵,¹³⁶ IL-17A can also induce chondrocytes to produce enzymes (such as collagenase 3 and MMP13) that degrade cartilage matrix.¹³⁷,¹³⁸ Thus IL-17A has a doubly catabolic effect.

IL-17F shares most of its biological effects with IL-17A. Although IL-17F is much less potent than IL-17A, it is capable of inducing significant cartilage matrix release and inhibiting new cartilage matrix synthesis as efficiently as IL-17A *in vitro*.¹⁶ Immunohistochemical studies showed that in addition to IL-17A, IL-17F is detected in synovium from RA but not from OA individuals.¹³⁹ Microarray studies showed that in RA synoviocytes both IL-17A and IL-17F induced a similar expression pattern in the presence of TNF.¹³⁹ Studies using *Il-17a⁻/⁻*, *Il-17f⁻/⁻*, and double deficient mice demonstrated that while IL-17A plays a major role in the development of arthritis in IL-1 receptor antagonist-deficient mice, IL-17F plays a marginal role.⁵⁴ Further study is needed to better understand the pathogenic function of IL-17F in RA.

#### Rheumatoid arthritis

Abundant evidence suggests a role for IL-17A in promoting RA in humans. IL-17A is increased in sera and synovial fluids of RA patients, as well as activated PBMC cultures of patients with RA compared to healthy controls.¹⁰⁰,¹¹⁷,¹²¹–¹²³ Immunostaining has identified IL-17A positive cells in synovial biopsies of RA, but not in patients with osteoarthritis (OA), spondyloarthropathy, or posttraumatic arthritis.¹²⁴ IL-17A can promote joint degradation in *ex vivo* models.¹²⁵ A two-year prospective study analyzing synovial tissues in RA patients demonstrated that IL-17A and TNFα mRNA levels are synergistic prognostic factors for worse outcomes.¹²⁶

A pathological role for IL-17 in rodent models of rheumatoid arthritis is well established. The earliest work by Lubberts and colleagues showed that blocking of endogenous IL-17 with a soluble IL-17RA in a CIA model results in suppression of arthritis and reduced joint damage, while overexpression of IL-17 enhanced collagen arthritis.¹²⁷ Later, *Il-17a⁻/⁻* mice were found to be resistant to CIA;¹²⁸ and neutralizing antibodies to IL-17A reduced inflammation and bone erosion in CIA.¹²⁹,¹³⁰ In a rat AIA model, treatment with IL-17RA-IgG1Fc fusion protein reduced inflammation and bone erosion.¹³¹

The mechanisms of action of IL-17 in RA pathogenesis have been much studied in recent years. It is generally regarded that IL-17, independently or in conjunction with TNF-α and IL-1β, stimulates various cell types to produce cytokines, chemokines,

#### Multiple sclerosis

Similar to RA, abundant murine studies have been performed that link IL-17 to EAE, a model for human MS. *Il-17a⁻/⁻* mice show delayed onset and reduced maximum-severity scores in EAE.¹⁴⁰,¹⁴¹ Therapeutic neutralization of IL-17 with IL-17R-Fc-protein in acute EAE (MOG-EAE) ameliorated clinical symptoms.¹⁴² Numerous studies demonstrated that neutralization of IL-17 with monoclonal antibodies ameliorated the disease course in EAE model.⁶,⁸,¹⁴² Our own study using *Il-17rc⁻/⁻* mice (that do not respond to IL-17A and IL-17F) showed that *Il-17rc* deficiency results in much reduced disease in MOG-EAE model.⁵⁸ Using
The IL-17 pathway as a major therapeutic target in autoimmune diseases

Hu *et al.*

Il-17a-and Il-17f-deficient mice, Yang *et al.* showed that while Il-17a-deficient mice were significantly delayed in disease onset and progression in a MOG-EAE model, only Il-17f$^{-/-}$ mice showed moderately improved recovery compared with both WT and Il-17a KO mice, suggesting that IL-17A but not IL-17F is required for the initiation of neuronal inflammation.

In humans, Matusevicius *et al.* demonstrated increased numbers of IL-17A mRNA expressing MNC in MS with higher numbers in CSF than blood, and with the highest numbers in blood during clinical exacerbations. ${ }^{143}$ Subsequently, microarray analysis of different MS lesions noted an increased number of IL-17A transcripts, particularly in more chronic lesions. ${ }^{144}$ More recently, Tzartos *et al.* found a significant increase in IL-17A$^{+}$ T cells, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes in active rather than inactive areas of MS lesions. ${ }^{145}$

Although the exact pathogenic role of IL-17 in EAE/MS is not well understood; one suggested mechanism is disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Kebir *et al.* demonstrated the expression of IL-17 and IL-22 receptors on blood-brain barrier endothelial cells (BBB-ECs) in multiple sclerosis lesions, and showed that IL-17 and IL-22 disrupt BBB tight junctions *in vitro* and *in vivo*. ${ }^{146}$ Subsequent follow-up studies by the same group revealed that IL-17 impairs integrity of the BBB through induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. ${ }^{147}$ The resulting oxidative stress activated the endothelial contractile machinery, which was accompanied by a down-regulation of the tight junction molecule occludin. ${ }^{147}$ Another suggested mechanism of IL-17-induced pathology in EAE/MS involves chemokine induction in the CNS. Using Ccr6 knockout mice, Reboldi *et al.* demonstrated that CCR6 expression on Th17 cells was required on the first wave of Th17 cells that entered the CNS through epithelial cells of the choroid plexus, which constitutively express CCL20, the ligand for CCR6. They also observed that CCR6 on T cells is not required for entry into CNS during active EAE. Based on these results, they postulated that T cells migrate into the CNS in two waves. ${ }^{148}$ Using anti-IL 17 treatment ${ }^{8}$ or $I l-17 r c^{-/-}$ mice in a MOG-EAE model, ${ }^{58}$ two groups demonstrated the lack of recruitment of autoreactive T cells into the CNS and inhibition of several chemokines known to be considerably induced in the CNS during EAE.

More recently, work in Li's group using conditional Actl knockout mice demonstrated that deletion of Actl in neuroectoderm-derived cells (including astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and neurons), but not in endothelial cells or macrophages and microglia, delayed the onset and reduced the severity of Th17 cell-induced EAE. Furthermore, they showed IL-17-mediated production of cytokines and chemokines was impaired in astrocytes from the CNS-restricted Actl-deficient mice. ${ }^{70}$ These data all fit nicely together, and a more detailed picture of Th17/IL-17's involvement in EAE begins to emerge (Fig. 2). In this model, CCR6-expressing autoreactive Th17 cells enter the CNS through the choroid plexus (wave 1), where epithelial cells constitutively express CCL20, the ligand of CCR6, and disseminate into the subarachnoid space. These T cells are locally reactivated by resident APCs that display self antigens and begin to make Th17 cytokines, including IL-17. IL-17 induces inflammatory gene expression in astrocytes, thus triggering the recruitment of a second wave of Th17 cells that enter the inflamed brain in a CCR6-independent manner, leading to an explosive inflammatory cascade associated with the onset of EAE.

**Asthma**

Because IL-17A and IL-17F potently recruit neutrophils into the lungs of mice via induction of CXC cytokines, ${ }^{149,150}$ it is reasonable to expect IL-17A and IL-17F to be involved in the airway neutrophilia that characterizes many mouse models of asthma, which, indeed, have been demonstrated in numerous studies of murine asthma models. In addition to stimulating airway neutrophilia, IL17A and IL-17F have other effects, which vary considerably in different studies. ${ }^{151}$ IL-17A and IL-17F also seem to play different roles in these asthma models.

Schnyder-Candrian *et al.* showed that IL-17RA-deficient mice fail to develop (compared to wild-type control mice) allergic asthma when sensitized with OVA/alum and challenged intranasally with the same antigen. ${ }^{152}$ Deduction of the role of IL-17A (or IL-17F) in asthma models from this study is, however, complicated by the later finding that IL-17RA also mediates signaling of IL-17E/IL-25, a potent Th2-promoting cytokine. ${ }^{153}$ In the same study, the authors also found that IL-17A neutralization that was restricted to the time of intranasal OVA

Figure 2. A two-stage model that involves Th17/IL-17 for the development of EAE. Epithelial cells of the uninflamed choroid plexus constitutively express CCL20, which attracts and facilitates activated peripheral myelin-specific Th17 cells (1) to cross the blood-brain barrier, reach choroid plexus, (2) and disseminate into the subarachnoid space (3) of the CNS. In the CNS, these Th17 cells are restimulated (4) by antigen-presenting cells (APC) to produce IL-17A and IL-17F, which then stimulate astrocyte to produce leukocyte-attracting chemokines. These astrocyte-derived chemokines then recruit a second wave of peripheral inflammatory cells that mediate EAE disease progression.

challenge augmented airway neutrophilia and AHR in C57BL/6 mice, whereas exogenous IL-17A administration had the opposite effects. In contrast, Wilson *et al.* demonstrated that intratra- cheal administration of IL-17A immediately after the challenge of OVA-sensitized C57BL/6 mice with aerosolized OVA exacerbated airway neutrophilia and AHR.¹⁵⁴ In the same study, they showed that IL-17F failed to do so, while Oda *et al.* found that overexpression of IL-17F (pulmonary transfer of Balb/c mice with mIL-17F gene) augmented Ag-induced allergic inflammatory responses in the OVA sensitization and challenge model, characterized in part by increased neutrophilia.¹⁵⁵ In one study using a Balb/c-ova model, neutralization of IL-17A before acute OVA challenge severely impaired the neutrophilic influx into inflamed airways following OVA, but aggravated bronchial eosinophilic inflammation and had little effect on AHR in one study.¹⁵⁶ In another study, neutralization of IL-17A at the time of OVA challenge (BALB/c mice) suppressed airway neutrophilia, eosinophilia, and AHR.¹⁵⁷ These variabilities probably reflect the different mouse strains and/or differences in study design.

In OVA/alum murine asthma model, *Il-17a⁻/⁻* mice exhibited reduced Th2 cytokine expression but developed normal airway AHR,¹⁴⁰,¹⁵⁸ whereas IL-17F-deficient mice had enhanced clinic symptoms, such as elevated type 2 cytokines and eosinophil functions compared with WT mice.¹⁴⁰ Therefore, it was suggested that IL-17A and IL-17F may have opposite functions in chronic allergic airway diseases.

In humans, IL-17A was found in the sera of allergic asthma patients,¹⁵⁹ and increased serum IL-17A was demonstrated to be an independent risk factor for severe asthma.¹⁶⁰ IL-17F was found in the airways of allergic asthma patients upon allergen challenge.¹⁶¹ Evaluating 867 unrelated Japanese subjects Kawaguchi *et al.* found that the IL17F gene polymorphism (His161Arg) was inversely associated with the development of asthma. This sequence variant was further found to be a loss-of-function mutant that antagonized wild-type IL-17F activity, and thereby provides protection against asthma.¹⁶² However, despite this strong functional data, the association results were not replicated by another case-control study.¹⁶³ In that study, the authors genotyped five IL17F SNPs, including H161R in 1,027 white

females, and found no association between any SNP or haplotype with asthma. This discrepancy may be due to environmental factors and race/ethnicity.

**Inflammatory bowel disease**

A number of murine studies have been performed to examine the roles of IL-17A and IL-17F in the development of intestinal inflammation. Neutralization of IL-17 aggravated DSS-induced colitis in mice, which is consistent with a later study where *Il-17a* knockout mice developed more severe disease in a DSS colitis model. Both studies suggest a protective role of IL-17A in the development of DSS-induced colitis. However, in another study of DSS-induced colitis, *Il-17a* knockout mice developed much reduced disease and mortality compared to wild-type controls, pointing to a pathological role of IL-17A. IL-17F also appears to play a pathological role in DSS-induced colitis: *Il-17f*-deficient mice demonstrated dramatically reduced CCL2, CCL5, and CCL7 expression compared to wild-type controls upon DSS treatment, which was associated with much milder pathology. In a recent study using the CD45RB transfer model of colitis, O'Connor and colleagues showed that CD45RB CD25 CD4 T cells from *Il-17a* mice induce an accelerated wasting disease relative to that from wild-type control mice, and was correlated with higher expression of genes encoding Th1 cytokines in colon tissue. They also demonstrated IL-17A negatively modulates Th1 polarization *in vitro*, therefore suggesting that IL-17A exerts a protective function in T cell-mediated intestinal inflammation through suppression of Th1 differentiation. Interestingly, in a similar study, when both IL-17A and IL-17F are blocked, the recipient mice develop reduced colitis measured by both histological and endoscopic scores. The reasons for these different results are unclear. Recently, data suggest that different microbiota environments affect Th17 cell development and IL-17 production in the gut. It is possible that mice used in different labs have different microbes resident in the gastrointestinal tract, which will impact the role of IL-17 pathway during experimental IBD in these models.

IL-17A expression in the mucosa and serum was elevated in patients with IBD (ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn's disease (CD)) when compared to normal subjects or to patients with infectious or ischemic colitis. Annunziato et al. identified IL-17A–producing T cells in the gut of patients with CD and found some of these cells produce both IL-17 and IFN-γ. These cells also express IL-23R and CCR6. Intestinal IL-17F mRNA expression was found elevated in inflamed colonic lesions compared to uninfamed biopsies in CD but not in UC. The IL-17F His161Arg polymorphism was found in one report not to be associated with IBD susceptibility, but in another report was correlated with the development of ulcerative colitis.

In conclusion, IL-17A and IL-17F possibly play significant roles in IBD, although many more studies are needed before the exact mechanisms are understood.

**Psoriasis**

Psoriasis is a chronic skin disease resulting from the dysregulated interplay between keratinocytes and infiltrating immune cells. There is now a growing body of evidence that supports a major role of Th17 cells and the IL-17 pathway in psoriasis. IL-17A and IL-17F were elevated in mouse model of psoriasis-like skin inflammation and human psoriatic skin lesions, reflecting the presence of infiltrating T cells that produce Th17 cytokines. Lowes et al. showed for the first time the discrete presence of IL-17A-producing cells within the dermis of psoriatic plaques.

IL-17A induces intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), IL-6, and IL-8 in human keratinocytes. It also synergizes with IL-22 to induce antimicrobial peptides such as beta-defensin 2 and S100A9. Fijishima et al. demonstrated that IL-17F can induce production of IL-6 in human keratinocytes *in vitro* at a higher magnitude than TNF-α or IL-17A, and that it also induces IL-6 in mouse skin after injection. CCL20 is overexpressed by keratinocytes in psoriasis while its receptor CCR6 is characteristically found in resident skin T cells. Thus, it is possible that skin preferentially recruits Th17 cells in resting or non-inflammatory states, and that perturbations (such as trauma and/or presence of microbes) that enhance IL-23 production by the sentinel cells in the skin allow for expansion of these cells and thus produce inflammation. Harper et al. recently demonstrated that both IL-17A and IL-22 induce keratinocytes to produce CCL-20 *in vitro* and *in vivo*. Therefore, it appears that the pathological effects of IL-17A and IL-17F are in part

mediated by keratinocytes through induction of proinflammatory cytokines that augment inflammation as well as chemokines that stimulate ongoing chemotaxis of new CCR6⁺ Th17 cells and CCR6⁺ dendritic cells from blood.

# Strategies to block the IL-17 pathway

Blocking the IL-17 pathway can be achieved at different levels. Upstream targets may include molecules that control Th17 differentiation. These include extracellular targets such as IL-6, IL-23, IL-1β, and TGF-β, and intracellular molecules such as RORγ, AHR, and RAR. One could also target the trafficking of Th17 cells—for example, CCR6 and its ligand CCL20. Depletion of Th17 cells may also be considered by targeting Th17 specific surface proteins. However, specific depletion of Th17 cells may be difficult as Th17 cells share many surface markers with Th1 cells, although intensity levels can differ. Recently, an antibody that specifically recognizes cell surface LTα has been shown to deplete both Th1 and Th17 cells. Importantly, this antibody blocks disease development in preclinical CIA model, supporting the depletion strategy in general.

More directly, one could target IL-17 itself and its receptors. Several biologics that neutralize IL-17 signaling are now in clinical development, including AIN457 (Novartis) and LY2439821 (Eli Lilly), both anti-IL-17A monoclonal antibodies. AIN457 has completed phase I/IIa trials for psoriasis, RA, and autoimmune uveitis and is in phase II trials for MS, Crohn's disease, and ankylosing spondylitis. LY2439821 is currently in phase II trials for RA and psoriasis. Preliminary results presented at the 2009 European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) and published in *Arthritis & Rheumatism* show that anti-IL-17A blocking antibodies improved signs and symptoms compared with placebo and they have good safety profiles. Another biologic in clinical development is AMG-827 (Amgen), a human monoclonal anti-IL-17RA antibody that blocks IL-17 signaling by binding to IL-17RA. AMG-827 has completed phase I trials for moderate to severe psoriasis and is in phase II trials for psoriasis and phase I/II trials for RA.

In conclusion, given the important pathogenic functions of the IL-17 pathway in multiple autoimmune diseases, strategies that specifically block this pathway may provide the next generation of efficacious therapies.
