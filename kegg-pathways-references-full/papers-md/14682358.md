# SIGNALLING MECHANISMS MEDIATING NEURONAL RESPONSES TO GUIDANCE CUES

**Kun-Liang Guan* and Yi Rao†**

Several families of extracellular guidance cues have been implicated in guiding neurons and axons to their appropriate destinations in the nervous system. Their receptors include single- and seven-transmembrane receptors, and their signal transduction pathways converge onto the Rho family of small GTPases, which control the cytoskeleton. A single guidance protein can use different mechanisms to regulate different kinds of motility or the motilities of different cell types. There is crosstalk between the signalling pathways initiated by distinct guidance cues. Studies of neuronal guidance mechanisms have shed light not only on neural development, but also on other processes that involve the extracellular regulation of the cytoskeleton.

During embryonic and postnatal development of the nervous system, neuronal precursor cells have to migrate to their final destinations and axons have to navigate to the correct targets to establish normal connectivity. Neuronal migration and axon pathfinding are guided by extracellular cues, which initially include netrins<sup>1–3</sup>, semaphorins<sup>4,5</sup>, ephrins<sup>6–8</sup> and Slits<sup>9</sup>. Many cues that were originally discovered for their roles in axon guidance also guide the migration of neuronal cell bodies<sup>10</sup>, and ‘neuronal’ guidance cues can also control leukocyte chemotaxis<sup>11</sup>. It has therefore been proposed that directional guidance mechanisms are fundamentally conserved among all somatic cells<sup>11,12</sup>. This idea is further supported by the findings that the chemokines, which were originally characterized as chemotactic factors for leukocytes, function directly in axon guidance and neuronal migration<sup>13–17</sup>, and that semaphorins and Slits function in normal and tumour-induced ANGIOGENESIS<sup>18,19</sup>.

cyclic nucleotides<sup>20,21</sup> and calcium<sup>22,23</sup> in the responding neurons can also regulate the attractive versus repulsive responses of axons. In addition to directional guidance of migrating neurons and projecting axons, the guidance cues also have important roles in axon outgrowth, axon branching and pruning, axon regeneration, dendritic branching and synaptic plasticity<sup>1–3,5–8</sup>.

This review will focus on recent studies on signalling mechanisms in axon guidance and neuronal migration in the vertebrate nervous system. Recently, morphogens for embryonic patterning, including the BONE MORPHOGENIC PROTEINS (BMPs), WNTS and sonic hedgehog (Shh), have also been implicated in axon guidance<sup>24–28</sup> (TABLE 1). We will discuss only signalling mechanisms that have been implicated in mediating the functions of these proteins in axon guidance and neuronal migration.

Models of axon guidance and neuronal migration Although various pathways of axon projection and neuronal migration have been studied in vertebrates, several pathways are frequently used and can be considered as classical models. In addition to the *in vivo* models described later, *in vitro* turning assays (BOX 1) are proving to be useful for studying the behaviour of the growth cone or the cell body.

This is a snapshot of the current picture and is incomplete. For example, Eph-ephrin reverse signalling is only partially characterized, and the exact relationship could not be drawn here. The function of Sonic hedgehog (Shh) in axon guidance has been shown by work in vertebrates, whereas a role for Hedgehog (Hh) in *Drosophila* in axon guidance has not been found, and the *Hh* gene seems to be absent in *C. elegans*. There are bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) in flies, but their function in axon guidance has not been established. A more extensive discussion of axon guidance molecules and mechanisms in invertebrates can be found in another review.

Retinotectal projections provide an excellent system to study topographic specificity. Axons from the temporal retina project to the rostral part of the tectum (FIG. 1a), nasal retina axons project to the caudal tectum (FIG. 1a), dorsal retina axons project to the ventral tectum, and ventral retina axons project to the dorsal tectum. Sperry proposed the chemoaffinity hypothesis to explain the topographic specificity of retinotectal projection, and this hypothesis was extended by Constantine-Paton and colleagues in the 1970s (REF. 31). It was also noted that the cues that guide retinal axon projection to the tectum must exist in other regions of the nervous system, because axons from ectopically transplanted retinal tissues can project to non-tectal regions. Bonhoeffer and colleagues established an elegant *in vitro* assay to investigate retinotectal projections, which led to the concept that repulsive cues were important and also allowed the investigators to purify the guidance molecules from the chick tectum. Their biochemical approach converged with the molecular approach of Flanagan and colleagues in rodents, resulting in the discoveries that ephrin-As act as the repulsive cues in the tectum and that the Eph tyrosine kinases are the receptors in retinal axons.

Molecular cues for earlier steps of retinal axon guidance have also been studied. Netrin can attract retinal axon projections from the retinal ganglion cell to the optic nerve head, Slit is crucial for retinal axons to stay in the optic nerve and cross only at the optic chiasm, and ephrin-Bs repel temporal retinal axons at the optic chiasm and force them to project to the ipsilateral tectum. The molecular mechanism for the earliest step (projecting towards the vitreal surface) is unknown, but the expression patterns of several Slit genes in the retina indicate that repulsion by Slit might have a role in this process.

The commissural axons in the spinal cord provide another important model for axon guidance in vertebrates (FIG. 1b). Commissural neurons are interneurons whose cell bodies are located in the dorsal neural tube, and there are several subtypes that express neurotransmitters such as GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid) in rodents, or glycine in *Xenopus*. Commissural axons project ventrally towards the FLOOR PLATE in the neural tube. They cross the floor plate and then turn longitudinally to project rostrally in some species (mouse, rat and zebrafish) (as shown in FIG. 1b), or to project both rostrally and caudally in other species (chicken and *Xenopus*). In the standard model, the floor plate attracts the commissural axons, allows them to cross it and then prevents the crossed axons from re-crossing. Naive commissural axons are potently attracted by the floor plate *in vitro*. Adhesive forces exerted by the floor plate on the commissural axons help the axons to invade and perhaps cross the floor plate. Interestingly, once the commissural axons have crossed the floor plate, they are no longer responsive to its attractive activity, but they gain responsiveness to a repulsive activity in the floor plate. It should be noted that the floor plate has not been shown to be required for the ventral projection of all commissural axons *in vivo*. For example, in mice lacking the *Gli2* gene, in which

The effects of molecular guidance cues on axon guidance and neuronal migration can sometimes be inferred from the expression patterns of the molecules and the phenotypes of mutants lacking or overexpressing the genes that encode these proteins. *In vivo*, the functions of these proteins were initially tested in assays that involved co-cultures of cells secreting the putative guidance cue and explants of primary neurons whose axons or cell bodies could respond to the cues. Typically, a cell line (such as HEK or COS) is transfected with a control vector or a cDNA for a specific guidance cue. Explants from the nervous system are isolated and cultured in a three-dimensional collagen matrix. When cultured alone or in the presence of an aggregate of the control cells, axons (or neuronal cell bodies) will migrate out of the explant and distribute symmetrically around the explant. If the explant is co-cultured with cells secreting an attractant, more axons will be observed in the quadrant that is proximal to the cell aggregates than in the distal quadrant. The opposite will happen if the cells secrete a repellent. The caveat of these assays is that they do not truly distinguish between attraction and motility promotion, or between repulsion and inhibition of motility.

To address this problem, a direct assay for axon guidance was established in the laboratory of M.-M. Poo in 1997, using primary neurons from the spinal cord of embryonic Xenopus that were cultured individually *in vitro*. A micropipette loaded with a guidance cue is positioned 45 degrees to the direction of a growing axon and about 100 μm from its tip. Time-lapse microscopy allows one to study precisely the effect of a putative cue on the axon. It can establish roles of putative cues in attraction and repulsion, or their effects on motility. Typical results are shown in panel a.

A direct assay for studying the effects of guidance cues on neuronal migration was established in 2003 by Ward *et al.* This assay allows simultaneous monitoring of a large number of migrating neurons, and the observation of the behaviour of individual neurons. Typical results are shown in panel b. In the lower panels, a neuron migrating rightward was presented with a source of Slit from the right side and it turned 180 degrees to migrate leftward. The upper panels show a control cell. The triangles in each panel indicate a fixed point for spatial reference. Time 0 indicates the time point at which Slit (or control) was presented. The time required before the cells turn is different depending on the gels and the concentration of the attractive or repulsive molecules.

The molecular identity of the floor-plate attractive activity is probably netrin and Shh. Commissural axons switch off responsiveness to the netrins after crossing the floor plate. The adhesive activity is mediated by Tag1 (or its chicken homologue axonin-1) on the axons and Nrcam in the floor plate. Slits and ephrins are repellents that are present in the floor plate.

Classical models of neuronal migration include the migration of neuronal precursor cells from the proliferative ventricular zone to the cortical plate in the neocortex (FIG. 1c), and the migration of precursor cells from the proliferative external germinal layer (EGL) to the internal granule cell layer (IGL) in the cerebellar primordium (FIG. 1d). These cells migrate radially in a direction that is perpendicular to the surface of the brain. They migrate along radially-aligned glial fibres, although the glial fibres do not provide polarized directional information.

Tangential migration is another mode of neuronal migration, in which cells migrate parallel to the surface of the brain. Tangential migration does not rely on glial fibres, although some cells might use the fibres of other neurons. An important model for tangential migration is the rostral migratory stream (RMS), in which precursor cells from the subventricular zone of the anterior forebrain (SVZa) migrate rostrally to form interneurons in the olfactory bulb (FIG. 1e). Directional guidance for both radial and tangential migration is provided by guidance cues that are deposited strategically along the pathways. Repulsive activities have been found at the origin of the RMS to drive SVZa cells, and attractive activities have been found in the target olfactory bulb. The repulsive activity might be conferred by Slit. The molecular nature of the attractant in the olfactory bulb has not yet been identified, but it seems to be different to currently known cues.

The Rho family of small GTPases  
During axon guidance, molecular cues act on the growth cone. For neuronal migration, it has not been established whether the molecular cues act only on the growth cone, or whether they also regulate the cytoskeleton in the cell body. The leading edge of the axon growth cone is a motile structure that constantly undergoes remodelling. Actin is the main component at the leading edge of the growth cone, and actin assembly is a key process that controls the growth and steering of axon growth cones, although recent evidence also supports a role for microtubules in axon guidance. Attractants and repellents can steer growth cones only when they are present in concentration gradients. Attractants promote actin polymerization in the part of the growth cone that is proximal to the source of the attractants, whereas repellents decrease actin polymerization in the proximal region of the growth cone. Differential actin polymerization and microtubule growth underlie directional guidance.

The Rho family of small GTPases, which includes Rho, Rac and Cdc42, have important roles in regulating actin cytoskeletal dynamics, and have been implicated in growth cone guidance. Rho promotes the assembly of contractile actin and myosin filaments (stress fibres),

the floor plate is absent, commissural axons still project to and cross the ventral neural tube.

*In vitro* and *in vivo* evidence indicates that the floor plate is crucial for longitudinal turning. In rodents, crossed commissural axons turn immediately towards the rostral end of the embryonic neural tube. Removal of the floor plate in explant assays resulted in the failure of the crossed commissural axons to turn longitudinally, and they continued to project circumferentially. In *Gli2*-/- mice, instead of projecting rostrally, crossed commissural axons in the spinal cord project both rostrally and caudally, indicating a role for the floor plate in regulating the rostrocaudal projection of commissural axons.

Figure 1 | Classical pathways of axon projection and neuronal migration. This figure shows pathways that are often used in studies of axon guidance (a and b) and neuronal migration (c–e).  
a | The retinotectal pathway. In amphibians and chicks, all retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons cross at the optic chiasm to project to the contralateral tectum. In mammals, ventrotemporal RGC axons project to the contralateral superior colliculus, whereas the other axons project to the ipsilateral superior colliculus. Regardless of the species, temporal (T) RGC axons project to the rostral tectum or superior colliculus, nasal (N) RGC axons project to the caudal tectum or superior colliculus. Dorsal/ventral mapping is not shown in this figure, but dorsal RGC axons project to the ventral tectum or the lateral superior colliculus, whereas ventral RGC axons project to the dorsal tectum or the medial superior colliculus.

proteins (GAPs). GAPs therefore act as negative regulators of Rho by facilitating their conversion from the GTP-bound form to the GDP-bound form. By contrast, guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) stimulate nucleotide release, facilitating the exchange of GDP for GTP, resulting in Rho activation. Guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors (GDIs) bind to the GDP form of Rho GTPases and inhibit GDP dissociation from Rho GTPases. The opposing actions of GAPs, GEFs and GDIs determine the relative GTP-binding level, and thereby influence the activities of these GTPases (FIG. 2).

Rho GAPs and Rho GEFs are themselves regulated by several extracellular and intracellular signalling pathways. Rho GAPs are found in eukaryotes, ranging from yeast to humans^{68,69}, and they are defined by the presence of the RhoGAP domain. Additional domains in the Rho GAPs might regulate GAP activity or target them to specific subcellular locations. There are approximately 80 Rho GAPs in the human genome. Of the 30 Rho GAPs that have been tested biochemically, some can inhibit RhoA, Rac and Cdc42, whereas others are specific for one or two Rho GTPases.

Two distinct families of Rho GEFs have been identified^{70}. The traditional Rho GEFs are defined by the presence of a Dbl homology (DH) domain, which is responsible for nucleotide exchange^{71}. Some Rho GEFs are specific for RhoA, Rac or Cdc42. For example, leukaemia-associated Rho GEF (LARG) and PDZRhoGEF only stimulate the nucleotide exchange of RhoA^{72,73}. Other GEFs, such as ephexin, can stimulate nucleotide exchange on all Rho family members^{74}. Virtually all Rho GEFs contain other domains, in addition to the DH domain^{70}, that probably regulate GEF function or localization. For example, a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain often coexists with a DH domain in tandem. PH domains bind to phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PtdIns3P) and can mediate signal-induced membrane association of Rho GEFs^{75}.

Recent studies have identified a new family of Rho GEFs^{76–78} — the CDM proteins — which is represented by the *Caenorhabditis elegans* CED-5, the mammalian DOCK180 and *Drosophila* Myoblast city (*Mbc*) proteins. They share a conserved domain that is termed either Docker^{76} or DHR2 (Dock homology region-2)^{77}. CED-5 is genetically upstream of Rac^{79}. *In vitro*, the Docker/DHR2 domain in DOCK180 can bind to and activate Rac^{76,77}. *In vivo*, DOCK180 can activate Rac either alone^{77} or together with the ELMO protein^{76}. DOCK180 does not regulate RhoA or Cdc42. Biochemical purification of a GEF for Cdc42 led to the finding of Zizimin^{78}, a new mammalian CDM protein that does not regulate RhoA or Rac activity. Five DOCK180 proteins and three ELMO proteins are predicted from the human genome. It remains to be tested whether all CDMs function as GEFs for specific Rho GTPases.

The human genome predicts approximately 20 Rho GTPases, 80 Rho GAPs, 50 traditional Rho GEFs with the DH domain and 5 Rho GEFs with the Docker/DHR2 domain. Some of these have been implicated in neuronal guidance and their roles will be discussed in the context of specific guidance cues.

Rac induces the formation of actin-rich membrane protrusions (lamellipodia) and Cdc42 induces the formation of actin-rich, finger-like membrane extensions (filopodia). Rac and Cdc42 activation promote actin polymerization at the leading edge, whereas Rho activation is thought to cause retraction through actinomysin contraction at the trailing edge. In neurons, attractive guidance cues typically activate Cdc42 and Rac, but inhibit RhoA. By contrast, repulsive cues are generally thought to activate Rho and inhibit Rac and Cdc42.

Many of the effectors that are downstream of Rho GTPases can modulate actin dynamics and cytoskeletal morphology^{67}. Similar to the Ras protein, Rho GTPases are active in the GTP-bound state and inactive in the GDP-bound form, and GTP-bound Rho proteins can interact with downstream effectors to induce cellular responses. Rho proteins have low intrinsic GTPase activities, which can be stimulated by GTPase-activating

OPTIC CHIASM

FLOOR PLATE
The neural tube has been divided into different regions. The ventral cells closest to the midline constitute the floor plate. The dorsal cells closest to the midline correspond to the roof plate. The alar plate (dorsal) and the basal plate (ventral) lie between these two cell populations and are separated by the sulcus limitans.

Netrins function through two classes of transmembrane receptors: **UNC-40** (REFS 81,82,87) and **UNC-5** (REF.88) in *C. elegans*, and their respective mammalian homologues Deleted in colorectal cancer (**DCC**) and **neogenin**<sup>89,90</sup> and UNC-5H-1,-2,-3 and -4 (REFS 91–94) (FIG. 3). Genetic studies in *C. elegans* have shown that UNC-6/netrin is required for both ventral and dorsal projection of pioneer axons, and that UNC-40 is primarily required for ventral projection and UNC-5 for dorsal projection<sup>87,89,95</sup>. Studies in mammals indicate that DCC/UNC-40 is required for both the attractive and repulsive responses, whereas UNC-5 is required only for the repulsion of some axons<sup>38,87–90,96</sup>.

DCC, the mammalian homologue of UNC-40, was originally identified as a candidate tumour suppressor gene in colon cancer<sup>97</sup>, although its role in tumour suppression has not been confirmed. DCC and neogenin mediate both the axon outgrowth and chemotactic functions of netrin<sup>87,89,90,95</sup>. DCC can bind to UNC-5, and this complex mediates growth cone repulsion<sup>87,88,92,96,98</sup>. Although findings in mammals seem to indicate that DCC cannot mediate repulsion by itself, it should be noted that genetic evidence in *C. elegans* indicates that either UNC-40 or UNC-5 alone can repel the distal tip cells in the gonads<sup>3</sup>. In *Drosophila*, UNC-5 can mediate short-range repulsion by itself, and can function together with the DCC homologue **Frazzled** in long-range repulsion<sup>99</sup>. So, different netrin receptors or receptor complexes determine the physiological response to netrin.

The intracellular domain of DCC has several motifs (P1, P2 and P3) that are conserved among *C. elegans*, *Drosophila* and mammals<sup>95</sup>. However, no known catalytic activity is predicted from the intracellular domain of DCC. Genetic screens in *C. elegans* have uncovered several genes whose mutations can interact with mutations in genes that encode netrin receptors<sup>92,100–103</sup>. Among these, the precise roles of *seu-1*, *seu-2* and *seu-3* are not known. However, **unc-34** is a worm homologue of *Drosophila* Enabled (**Ena**) and mammalian **Mena**<sup>100,102</sup>, and UNC-34 protein and its family members, Ena, Mena, Vasp and Evl share conserved Ena/Vasp homology (EVH) 1 and EVH2 domains<sup>104</sup>. These proteins can bind to actin-associated proteins and nucleate actin polymerization<sup>105,106</sup>. UNC-34 seems to act downstream of the conserved P1 domain of UNC-40, whereas **CED-10** and **UNC-115** seem to mediate signalling from the P2 domain of UNC-40, although a direct connection has not been shown. *ced-10* encodes a Rac homologue and *unc-115* encodes a putative actin-binding protein that is similar to the vertebrate protein **Ablim**<sup>107</sup>. Interestingly, genetic studies indicate that UNC-115 acts downstream of CED-10 (REF.103). These studies imply that the netrin receptor UNC-40/DCC links to the actin cytoskeleton through UNC-34 and UNC-115 (FIG. 2).

In vertebrates, netrin attraction seems to involve phospholipase C (PLC)<sup>108</sup>, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)<sup>108</sup>, mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases<sup>109–111</sup> and the small GTPases Cdc42 and Rac<sup>112,113</sup>. Inhibition of PLC and PI3K reduces axon attraction by netrin<sup>108</sup>. The MAP kinases have been implicated in adaptation of axonal responses to netrin<sup>110</sup>. Biochemical studies have

**Axon guidance molecules and their receptors**

**Netrin signalling through UNC-40/DCC and UNC-5.** Netrins were the first family of directional guidance cues to be found in both invertebrate and vertebrate nervous systems<sup>2,3</sup>. In *C. elegans*, genetic screens for mutants that affect axon guidance led to the finding of **UNC-6**, the prototypical netrin<sup>80–82</sup>. Unc-6 is involved in controlling the direction of both ventrally and dorsally projecting axons<sup>82</sup>. The sequence of the *unc-6* gene predicts that it codes for a secreted protein<sup>83</sup>.

In mammals, studies of commissural axons in the spinal cord revealed a diffusible guidance activity in the floor plate<sup>45</sup>. The floor plate can both promote the outgrowth of commissural axons and attract them<sup>45–48,84</sup>. Biochemical purification of the axon-outgrowth-promoting activity from chick brains led to the discovery of netrin-1 and netrin-2 (REFS 82,85,86). Sequence similarities between the netrins and *C. elegans* UNC-6 immediately indicate the existence of a highly conserved family<sup>83,85</sup>. Several netrins have now been identified, and the same netrin can be attractive to some axons and repulsive to others.

cytoplasmic kinase for UNC-5 phosphorylation. Co-expression of Src increases UNC-5 phosphorylation<sup>117</sup>, although the biological role of Src family kinases in UNC-5 phosphorylation and netrin signalling remains to be established.

A screen for genes that control motor axon guidance in *C. elegans* led to the discovery of *max-1*. *max-1* mutants genetically interact with *unc-5* and *unc-6*, but not *unc-40* (REF. 101). *max-1* encodes a cytoplasmic protein with multiple domains, including two PH domains, a myosin tail homology 4 (MyTH4) domain and a Band4.1/ezrin/radixin/moesin (FERM) domain. It will be interesting to investigate how MAX-1 functions specifically in the UNC-5 pathway.

Netrin has recently been found to increase local protein synthesis and degradation in the growth cones of retinal axons<sup>111,119</sup>, and this netrin-induced protein synthesis seems to be required for both attraction and repulsion<sup>119</sup>. Activation of MAP kinases has been implicated in netrin-stimulated protein synthesis in axons<sup>111</sup>. CASPASE activation and PROTEOSOME-mediated protein degradation have also been implicated in netrin signalling, although most experiments were obtained with pharmacological inhibitors<sup>111</sup>. Further studies are needed to establish that caspases and proteosomes are specifically involved in netrin signalling. The importance of protein synthesis and the MAP kinases has also been observed for the adaptation of *Xenopus* spinal cord axons to netrin<sup>110</sup>. These axons undergo desensitization and resensitization in the presence of a netrin gradient. Resensitization is blocked by inhibition of either the MAP kinases or protein synthesis. These reports demonstrate the importance of protein synthesis in netrin signalling.

In addition to their roles in axon guidance, netrins can also promote axon outgrowth. The early signalling steps that mediate the attractive and outgrowth-promoting responses seem to be similar, although intracellular components that are required only for netrin-induced axon outgrowth have been identified. The nuclear factor of activated T cell (NFAT) transcription factors have recently been found to act downstream of the DCC receptor to promote axon outgrowth<sup>120</sup> (FIG. 3). Inhibition of the phosphatase calcineurin by cyclosporin A blocks NFAT activation and axon outgrowth in response to netrin stimulation *in vitro*. A triple knockout of *Nfatc2*, *c3* and *c4* in the mouse embryo produces marked defects in axonal outgrowth. The extension defects of the commissural axons are similar to those found in DCC or netrin-1 knockout animals. These studies indicate that the calcineurin-NFAT pathway has a role in commissural axon outgrowth in response to netrin. It should be noted that the involvement of NFATs depends on transcription and works on a longer time frame than netrin-induced axon turning, which does not involve NFATs.

**Semaphorin signalling**. The semaphorins are a family of secreted and membrane-associated proteins<sup>121</sup>. In *Drosophila*, genetic studies of Fasciclin IV, a protein that had been implicated in axon fasciculation, led to the finding of the prototypical invertebrate Semal (REF. 122). In vertebrates, semaphorins were identified from studies of

Figure 3 | Intracellular signalling pathways of netrin receptors. DCC (Deleted in colorectal cancer) can mediate both axon-outgrowth-promoting activity and axon attraction of netrin. Calcineurin and NFATs (nuclear factor of activated T cells) are involved only in axon outgrowth, and the other components shown in the left-hand panel are probably involved both in outgrowth and attraction. The middle panel shows that the interaction of DCC and UNC5 mediates the repulsive response to netrin. The two right-hand panels show that work in *Drosophila* and *Caenorhabditis elegans* indicates that either DCC or UNC5 alone might also mediate repulsion. MAX1 is only required for UNC5 function, perhaps in repulsion. Slit might induce Robo binding to DCC and silence its response to netrin (not shown here).

SH3 DOMAIN  
Src-homology domains are involved in interactions with phosphorylated tyrosine residues on other proteins (SH2 domains) or with proline-rich sections of other proteins (SH3 domains).

DEATH DOMAIN  
A protein-protein interaction domain found in many proteins that are involved in signalling and apoptosis.

CASPASES  
A family of intracellular cysteine endopeptidases that have a key role in inflammation and mammalian apoptosis. They cleave proteins at specific aspartate residues.

PROTEASOME  
A protein complex responsible for degrading intracellular proteins that have been tagged for destruction by the addition of ubiquitin.

Plexins have a large conserved intracellular domain, which is essential for signal transduction<sup>121</sup>. Interestingly, the intracellular domain contains significant sequence similarities to the GAP domain of the Rap GAP subfamily<sup>136</sup>. However, it is unclear whether plexin has any GAP activity and what the targets of its GAP domain might be. Rho family GTPases have been shown to have important roles in plexin signalling. Rac can interact with plexin-B, but not with plexin-A or plexin-C<sup>136–138</sup>, and it has been suggested that plexin-B might suppress Rac function by competing with other Rac downstream targets, such as p21-activated kinase (Pak)<sup>139</sup>. Genetic studies in *Drosophila* also indicate that plexin-2 (the *Drosophila* plexin-B homologue) suppresses the ability of Rac to activate PAK<sup>140</sup>.

Rho activation is a common feature that is associated with growth cone repulsion<sup>65</sup>. A connection between plexin-B and RhoA regulation has been revealed by a direct interaction between plexin-B and PDZRhoGEF and LARG<sup>141–145</sup>, which are PDZ domain-containing GEFs that are specific for Rho. The PDZ domain of PDZRhoGEF and LARG interacts directly with the C-terminal PDZ recognition sequence of plexin-B, and it has been shown that Sema4D stimulates RhoA activation through PDZRhoGEF/LARG.

Surprisingly, the other plexin family members, such as plexin-A1, contain neither the Rac binding Cdc42/Rac1-interacting binding (CRIB) motif nor the C-terminal PDZ recognition sequence. However, the Fes protein tyrosine kinase can directly associate with the cytoplasmic domain of plexin-A1, and Fes interacts with the CRMP (collapsin response mediator protein)/CRAM (CRMP-associated molecule) complex<sup>146,147</sup>. The CRMP/CRAM complex has a role in the regulation of actin polymerization and microtubule dynamics. Stimulation of Sema3A enhances the association of Fes with plexin and increases Fes-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of plexin-A1, CRMP and CRAM. CRMP can bind tubulin directly<sup>148</sup> and this provides an interesting connection between axon guidance and microtubule organization in a region of the growth cone that lies behind the actin-rich region.

The Src family tyrosine kinase Fyn has also been implicated in plexin-A signalling. Neurons from Fyn mutant mice have a defect in Sema3A-induced growth cone collapse<sup>149</sup>. Cdk5, a member of the cyclin-dependent kinase family that is specifically expressed in the nervous system, binds to and functions downstream of plexin-A2 (REF. 149). Although Rac does not directly interact with plexin-A1, another Rho family GTPase, Rnd, does<sup>150</sup>. However, conflicting reports show that Rnd interacts with plexin-B, but not plexin-A<sup>151</sup>. Rnd has recently been shown to interact with and modulate p190GAP, which is a Rho-specific GAP<sup>152</sup>.

These studies provide evidence to support the involvement of small GTPases and tyrosine kinases in plexin-mediated intracellular signalling in response to semaphorins. MAP kinase activity and protein synthesis, which are known consequences of activation of GTPases and tyrosine kinases, have been implicated in Sema3A signalling<sup>111</sup>. It is worth noting that some semaphorins

growth cone collapse activity<sup>123</sup>, and **Sema3A**/collapsin-1 was the first vertebrate semaphorin to be discovered<sup>124</sup>. It soon became clear that semaphorins are a family of conserved proteins that can mediate axon repulsion and growth cone collapse in various regions<sup>125–127</sup>. Semaphorins have been found in several other tissues in addition to the nervous system, and they have been implicated in immune responses<sup>128,129</sup>.

The semaphorin receptors include the neuropilins (NPs) and the plexins<sup>121</sup> (FIG. 4). Neuropilins were identified as transmembrane proteins that could bind to Sema3A<sup>130,131</sup>. However, they have a very short intracellular domain that is not essential for semaphorin signalling. Neuropilins can associate with plexin and form a functional receptor complex for Sema<sup>132,133</sup>. For example, the NP1–plexin A1 complex is the functional receptor for Sema3A. By contrast, plexin B1 directly binds to Sema4D without the neuropilins, so some plexins can serve as functional semaphorin receptors on their own. Genetic and cell biological studies have shown that the intracellular domain of plexin is essential for semaphorin signalling.

In addition to neuropilin and plexin, other transmembrane proteins have been implicated as semaphorin receptors or components of the receptor complexes. The hepatocyte growth factor receptor **Met**, a receptor tyrosine kinase, has been shown to form a complex with plexin-B1 (REF. 134). The binding of Sema4D to plexin-B1 activates the Met tyrosine kinase and stimulates plexin-B1 tyrosine phosphorylation through Met. Genetic studies in *Drosophila* have also implicated off-track (**Otk**), which associates with plexin, as a component of the semaphorin receptor complex<sup>135</sup>. Otk shows sequence similarities to transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptors but lacks the essential residues for kinase activity.

PDZ DOMAIN  
A peptide-binding domain that is important for the organization of membrane proteins, particularly at cell-cell junctions, including synapses. It can bind to the carboxyl termini of proteins or can form dimers with other PDZ domains.

Members of the Semaphorin family therefore bind to different classes of receptor or receptor complexes, and some semaphorins might bind different receptors in different cells to induce distinct physiological responses.

**Ephrins and Ephs forward and reverse signalling** Ephrins are membrane-associated guidance molecules, and they can be divided into two classes on the basis of their mechanism of membrane association^{6,162}. The A-subclass ephrins are tethered to the membrane by a GPI link, whereas the B-subclass ephrins are type I transmembrane proteins with a cytoplasmic domain. The Eph proteins are transmembrane proteins with an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain, and they were originally defined as the receptors for ephrins A and B. However, as we shall see (FIG. 5), it has also been shown that Ephs can act as ligands for the ephrins.

The first ephrin was discovered without any knowledge of its function^{163}. An EXPRESSION-CLONING based screen for Eph ligands led to the discovery of the first biochemically characterized ephrin^{36}, and the first functional identification of the ephrins was the culmination of a time-consuming search for molecules that are expressed in a gradient fashion in the tectum to guide the projection of retinal axons^{33,35,37}. In the developing nervous system, ephrins cause collapse and repulsion of growth cones. In the adult nervous system, ephrins have roles in synaptic plasticity^{164,165}, at least partly through the regulation of actin dynamics during dendritic spine morphogenesis^{165,166}.

Signal transduction by the Eph receptors has features that are common with growth-factor receptor kinases, and also some unique features. Ephrin induces Eph receptor dimerization and kinase activation. Activation of the Eph receptors results in tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptor itself and downstream substrates, creating binding sites for SH2 domain-containing proteins. In contrast to mitogenic growth factor receptors, which generally activate Ras and MAP kinase signalling, Eph receptors do not activate Ras or extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). Instead, activation of Eph receptors has been reported to result in recruitment of Ras GAP, which then inactivates Ras and suppresses ERK activation^{167,168}. This is consistent with the observation that ephrins do not exhibit mitogenic effects.

Several proteins have been shown to interact with tyrosine-phosphorylated Eph receptors, although the biological functions of these associations are not completely clear. Src family tyrosine kinases, including Fyn, have been shown to interact with Eph receptors^{169,170}. Mutations in the Abelson kinase (Abl) and the Abl-related Arg kinase produce similar phenotypes to the ephrin-A5 knockout in mice^{171}, indicating that Abl and Arg have roles in ephrin signalling. Consistently, both Abl and Arg can associate with Eph receptors directly through the SH2 domain and tyrosine phosphorylation, or indirectly through other proteins^{172}. Abl and Arg regulate actin polymerization, and might contribute to the signalling pathway from Eph receptors to actin cytoskeletal organization.

Figure 5 | Forward and reverse ephrin-Eph signalling. Ephs are the largest subfamily of receptor tyrosine kinases. Ephrin-As are linked to the membrane by glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI). Their reverse signalling requires other transmembrane proteins. Ephrin-Bs are transmembrane proteins, and their reverse signalling is mediated by at least three different intracellular pathways, one involving tyrosine phosphorylation, another involving J un-N terminal kinase (JNK) but not tyrosine phosphorylation upstream of JNK, and the third involving RGS (regulator of G protein signalling) inhibition of heterotrimeric G proteins. Abi1, Abl interacting protein 1; CAP, c-Abl associated protein; JNK N-terminal kinase; PI3K, phosphoinositol 3-kinase; SAM, sterile α motif

might use different receptors to induce different physiological responses in other cell types. For example, a unique function has been found for **Sema7A**: it does not repel axons, but rather promotes axon outgrowth^{153}. In this context, Sema7A does not signal through neuropilins or plexins. Instead, its signalling seems to be mediated by the binding of its RGD motif to INTEGRINS, which activate MAPKs and focal adhesion kinase (FAK)^{153} (FIG. 4).

Two semaphorins are used to regulate immune cells. Sema4D (CD100) — a transmembrane semaphorin that is cleaved into a diffusible form in the immune system^{128,154,155} — regulates T cell adhesion^{155}, B cell aggregation and survival^{128}, lymphocyte activation^{156–158} and monocyte migration^{159}, but these actions are not mediated through neuropilins or plexin-B. Instead, they are mediated by **CD72**, a lectin-related transmembrane receptor^{156,159,160}. **Sema4A** also functions in the immune system, again not through neuropilins or plexins, but through **Tim2**, a member of the T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain proteins^{161}.

containing a PDZ domain. The Eph-ephrin pathway interacts with the chemokine pathways, and the functional significance of ephrin reverse signalling through the PDZ domain will be discussed later in the context of chemokines.

A further surprise is that the GPI-linked ephrin-As can also mediate reverse signalling, although they do not have intracellular domains<sup>178</sup>. Activation of ephrin-A5 or -A2 by EphA3 or EphA5 increases cell adhesion through integrin activation<sup>179–181</sup>. Fyn kinase and p120 have been implicated in ephrin-A reverse signalling<sup>180,182</sup>, and the phosphorylation of p120 is specifically induced by ephrin-A activation<sup>181</sup>, although its functional role remains to be established. Reverse signalling through ephrin-A is thought to mediate attraction or adhesion<sup>178</sup>.

**Slit signalling through Robo.** Mutations in the *slit* gene were uncovered in *Drosophila* in a screen for genes involved in embryonic patterning<sup>182</sup>, and its cDNA was isolated from a molecular screen for genes that encode epithelial growth factor (EGF) repeats<sup>183</sup>. *slit* mutants were thought to be defective in both the differentiation of midline glial cells and the projection of the commissural axons, and the axonal defects were thought to be secondary to the glial cell defects<sup>183,184</sup>. It was not until 1999 that three groups independently showed that *Drosophila* and vertebrate Slits were axon repellents<sup>43,185–187</sup>. In addition to repelling axons, Slits have also been shown to be important for neuronal migration<sup>10,188,189</sup>.

Roundabout (*Robo*) is a cell surface receptor that is responsible for the repulsive effect of Slit<sup>43,185,186</sup>. Robo is a single-pass transmembrane protein<sup>190,191</sup>. It contains five immunoglobulin (Ig) domains and three fibronectin type III repeats in its extracellular part. The intracellular region of *Drosophila* Robo contains four identifiable conserved motifs, designated CC0, CC1, CC2 and CC3. There are two additional *Drosophila* Robos — *Robo2* and *Robo3* — that do not contain CC2 and CC3 (REFS 192,193). All vertebrate Robos are similar to *Drosophila* Robo (FIG. 6). They are involved in multiple pathways of axon projection (including retinal and commissural axons) and neuronal migration (including those in the RMS and the neocortex).

Genetic studies in *Drosophila* indicate that the Abl tyrosine kinase might have either a synergistic or antagonistic role in Robo signalling<sup>194,195</sup>. Downstream of Abl are Enabled (Ena), a substrate of Abl<sup>196</sup>, and Capulet (*Capt*), a homologue of the adenylyl cyclase-associated protein. It is not clear whether Capt requires adenylyl cyclase for its function in axon guidance, because Capt without the cyclase-interacting domain can still partially rescue the phenotype in *Drosophila* mutants that lack the full-length Capt. The receptor tyrosine phosphatases Ptp10D and Ptp69D might positively regulate Slit/Robo signalling<sup>197</sup>, probably by antagonizing the Abl kinase. The roles of these proteins in vertebrates are not yet known.

A role for Rho GT Pases in Robo-mediated repulsion has been shown in vertebrates. The proline-rich CC3 motif in Robo binds directly to the SH3 domain in a subfamily of Rho GAPs<sup>198</sup>. In cultured

DOMINANT NEGATIVE  
A mutant molecule that can form a heteromeric complex with the normal molecule, knocking out the activity of the entire complex.

mammalian cells, srGAP1 can bind to and decrease the level of active Cdc42 and RhoA, but not Rac1. Extracellular application of Slit to primary neurons increases the intracellular binding of Robo and srGAP1, and inhibits Cdc42 activity in a Robo- and srGAP-dependent manner. The ability of Slit to regulate Rho GTPases depends on the srGAP interacting domain in Robo, and a dominant-negative srGAP1 inhibits Slit signalling both biochemically and functionally, implying that srGAPs have an important role in mediating the signalling from Robo to Cdc42. The repulsive effect of Slit on migrating SVZa cells was lost when the constitutively active Cdc42 was introduced into the responding neurons, indicating that inactivation of Cdc42 is essential for mediating repulsive Slit/Robo signalling during neuronal migration. These observations support roles for srGAPs and Cdc42 in the Slit/Robo pathway<sup>198</sup>.

Recent work in *Drosophila* indicates that Slit activation of Rac1 is important for its repulsive activity<sup>199</sup>. Strong evidence has been provided to show that reduction of *rac1* dosage enhanced the phenotype of *slit* and *robo* mutations, and vice versa<sup>199</sup>. The adaptor Nck/Dock and the downstream kinase Pak have also been implicated in the Slit/Robo pathway: presumably from Robo to Nck/Dock to Rac1 to Pak, if a linear pathway is to be drawn. Although Slit has been observed to activate Rac1 in some mammalian cells<sup>198</sup>, the known role of Rac1 in lamellipodia formation makes it difficult to understand the role of Rac1 (and Pak) activation in repulsion. The involvement of Nck/Dock and Rac1 activation in mediating attracting responses to netrin<sup>112–115</sup> also makes the assignment of molecules that are specific to attractive and repulsive pathways difficult.

It should be noted that results from studies in *C. elegans* imply some complexity in the Slit/Robo relationship. First, although there is only one *slit* gene (*slt-1*) and one *robo* gene (*sax-3*) in worms, some of the *sax-3/robo* mutant phenotypes are absent in *slit* mutants<sup>200</sup>. It is unclear whether Robo can signal without ligand activation, or whether there is another ligand for Robo. Second, Slit might use UNC-40/DCC as a receptor in its signalling<sup>196</sup>. Some phenotypes of gain-of-*slt-1*-function can be suppressed by loss of *unc-40* function, whereas mutants that are trans-heterozygous for *sax-3/robo* and *unc-40* are phenotypically similar to homozygous *sax-3/robo* mutants. No similar genetic interactions are detected between *unc-5/netrin* and *slt-1* or *unc-5/netrin* and *sax-3/robo*, indicating that Slit functions through UNC-40 independently of netrin/DCC signalling<sup>196</sup>. The downstream mechanisms are not presently known.

**Chemokines.** Chemokines are a large family of proteins that function in leukocyte trafficking. Leukocyte chemotaxis was discovered by Leber in 1888 (REF. 201) and is one of the best-characterized models of cell migration. The first chemokine was found in 1977 without any knowledge of its function<sup>202</sup>, and the characterization of interleukin-8 (IL8) in 1987 marked the beginning of functional studies of the chemokines<sup>203</sup>. It is now well known that chemokines are crucial regulators of leukocyte migration and function.

The chemokine stromal derived factor 1 (Sdf1) is involved in axon guidance and neuronal migration. Sdf1 was originally found in the immune system<sup>204,205</sup>, where it functions as a chemoattractant for leukocytes through its receptor Cxcr4. In the mouse cerebellum, the migration of EGL cells to form the IGL occurs after birth. However, when either the *Sdf1* or *Cxcr4* gene was knocked out, cerebellar granule cells were prematurely present in the embryonic IGL<sup>206–208</sup>, indicating that Sdf1 either directly or indirectly prevents granule cells from migrating prematurely<sup>206,207</sup>.

The precise role of Sdf1 in granule cell migration was only discovered recently. Sdf1 is expressed in the meninges (a non-neural tissue that is external to the EGL) and can attract embryonic EGL cells<sup>13,14,16</sup>, causing them to be anchored in the external layer. The absence of anchoring in *Sdf1*- and *Cxcr4*-knockout mice results in premature migration of EGL cells into the IGL. Importantly, Sdf1 does not attract postnatal EGL cells<sup>16</sup>, and this switch in neuronal responsiveness occurs through the inhibition of Sdf1-Cxcr4 signalling by Eph and ephrins<sup>14</sup>. Ephrin-B2 and EphB2 are expressed in the postnatal, but not embryonic, EGL cells. The intracellular part of ephrin-B2 binds to PDZ-RGS3 — a member of the RGS (regulators of G proteins) family, which are GAPs for heterotrimeric G proteins (FIG. 4). Because PDZ-RGS3 can potentially inactivate Cxcr4, Lu *et al.* tested the effect of Eph receptors on granule cell migration induced by Sdf1 (REF. 15). The finding that EphB2 inhibits granule cell chemotaxis towards Sdf1 supports the idea that reverse signalling of EphB2 through ephrin-B2 in the cerebellum inhibits Sdf1-Cxcr4 signalling, presumably through PDZ-RGS3. Sdf1 and Cxcr4 are also involved in the guidance of axons from cerebellar granule cells<sup>17</sup> and the migration of dentate granule cells in the hippocampus<sup>15,209</sup>.

The chemokine Sdf1 and its receptor Cxcr4 are therefore used both in leukocytes and neurons. In leukocytes, chemokines signal through seven-transmembrane receptors and heterotrimeric G proteins. Chemokine activation results in receptor coupling to G proteins, release of the βγ subunits of G proteins, and activation of effectors such as Ca<sup>2+</sup>, FAK, PI3K, the MAP kinases and the Rho GTPases. They also regulate the function and distribution of integrins. It remains to be tested which of these intracellular components are involved in axon guidance and neuronal migration.

**Other axon guidance cues.** Recent reports have implicated well-known morphogens in axon guidance in vertebrates. The involvement of BMPs and Shh was quite surprising, because they also function in the developmental steps that precede axon guidance in the neural tube. Therefore, it was important to ensure that the observed effects on axon projection could not be attributed to an earlier effect on dorsoventral patterning. BMPs belong to the transforming growth factor (TGFβ) superfamily, and they are morphogens that regulate early development and cell type specification<sup>210</sup>.

BMPs are secreted from the roof plate of the vertebrate neural tube, and form a gradient that is important for the determination of dorsal neural cell fates. Bmp7 is expressed in the regions dorsal to the commissural neurons, and it was found to repel commissural axons<sup>25,211</sup>, leading to the proposal that it might initiate ventral projection of the commissural axons. The downstream Bmp7 signalling mechanisms that are involved in axon guidance in mammals are, at present, unknown. However, findings in *C. elegans* might provide a clue. The *C. elegans* **UNC-129** protein is a TGFβ family member that is closely related to the BMPs<sup>24</sup>. *unc-129* is required to guide pioneer motor axons along the dorsoventral axis of *C. elegans*, and its role in the repulsion of these axons is similar to that of UNC-6/netrin<sup>24,212</sup>. The role of UNC-129 in axon guidance seems to be mediated by a non-canonical mechanism that is distinct from the classical TGFβ receptors (transmembrane serine/threonine kinases).

Shh is an important morphogen for patterning various tissues. In the mammalian neural tube, Shh is secreted by the NOTOCHORD and the floor plate, and is crucial for the determination of ventral cell fates<sup>213</sup>. It has now been implicated as a chemoattractant for commissural axons<sup>27</sup>. Although netrin-1 is made in the same region as Shh, the presence of attractive signals in floor plate explants from *netrin-1*-knockout embryos implies that there are additional attractants<sup>27,214</sup>. Charron *et al.* have shown that Shh mimics the netrin-independent activity of the floor plate and can directly attract commissural axons without first changing ventral cell fate<sup>27</sup>. During dorsoventral patterning, Shh binds to the transmembrane receptor Patched (**Ptc**) and relieves Ptc inhibition of Smoothened (**Smo**), another seven-transmembrane protein. This classical Shh signalling pathway also seems to be involved in mediating axonal attraction by Shh<sup>27</sup>. The finding of a role for Shh is surprising, partly because there is no apparent homologue of hedgehog (Hh) in *C. elegans*, where many axons are guided by the midline and UNC-6/netrin, and partly because there is no evidence that Hh functions as a guidance cue in *Drosophila*. The expression of Hh in *Drosophila* is not consistent with a role in midline guidance or synergistic interaction with netrin. Further investigation is required to determine whether the classical downstream signalling molecules that are used in cell type specification are also employed in axon guidance.

The Wnt family of secreted proteins, which are best known for their roles in embryonic patterning<sup>215</sup>, have now been shown to be required to control the anterior–posterior aspects of commissural axon guidance through the Derailed (**Drl**) receptor<sup>26,28</sup> in the *Drosophila* embryo. The insulin receptor (InR), which is involved in the control of food uptake, learning and memory in *Drosophila*<sup>216</sup>, has also been found to be required for the pathfinding of photoreceptor axons that project from the retina to the optic lobe in the brain<sup>217</sup>, perhaps not through the fly homologue of the vertebrate insulin receptor substrate, but through the adapter protein Dock/Nck<sup>217</sup>, a Pak kinase (**Misshapen**) and the cytoskeletal regulator Bifocal (**Bif**)<sup>218–221</sup>. It remains to be established whether InsR is truly guiding or simply permissive, because the known sites of insulin-like peptide production are not located near the origin or the destination of the retinal axons<sup>222</sup>.

In vertebrates, axons that project from the temporal part of the retina to the rostral optic tectum are guided by repulsive cues in the caudal tectum. In addition to the ephrins, repulsive guidance molecule (**RGM**) is also found in the caudal tectum<sup>223</sup>. Functional characterization shows that RGM repels axons from the temporal but not the nasal parts of the retina. The RGM protein is anchored to the membrane by GPI, and its receptor is unknown.

### Crosstalk between different pathways

During development, growth cones have to respond to several signals in the extracellular environment. For example, commissural axons have to respond to the attractive signals of netrin and Shh, as well as the repulsive signals of Slit and Semaphorin. Different signals have to be integrated in the growth cone to reach an appropriate response, and this requires crosstalk between the signalling pathways.

Receptor–receptor interaction is one mechanism for coordinating the response through different pathways. Both DCC and UNC-5 can bind netrin, but they produce different responses — DCC usually elicits the attractive response, whereas UNC-5 alone or in complex with DCC is required for repulsion. The intracellular domain of UNC-5 can interact directly with DCC<sup>98</sup>, and netrin induces receptor complex formation in neurons that express both DCC and UNC-5. UNC-5 seems to be able to convert the DCC attractive response to repulsion, although the molecular mechanism is not understood. It should be noted that the formation of this receptor complex does not explain why UNC-5 or DCC alone can mediate a repulsive response.

Interaction between the netrin and Slit pathways was demonstrated by Stein and Tessier-Lavigne when they showed that Slit, but not netrin, can induce DCC and Robo to interact with each other<sup>224</sup>. The intracellular conserved CC1 domain of Robo can directly associate with the conserved P3 domain in DCC. This receptor association has been thought to silence the attractive response but not the growth-stimulating activity of netrin. They propose that this interaction is crucial for Slit to turn off the netrin response in commissural axons in the neural tube. It should be noted that in some regions of the mammalian central nervous system (CNS), the activities of Slit and netrin are the same. For example, both Slit and netrin repel neurons that migrate from the anterior forebrain to the olfactory bulb<sup>10,60</sup>. The inhibitory effect of Slit on netrin signalling is therefore unlikely to be of general importance in all regions of the CNS.

There are also interactions between ephrins and Eph in the same cells, which can modulate the sensitivity of Eph to ligands on other cells. Drescher and colleagues have shown that temporal axons are responsive to the repellents (presumably ephrins) in the caudal tectum because temporal axons express only a small

amount of ephrin-A<sup>225</sup>. Overexpression of ephrin-A in temporal axons would confer resistance to the caudal tectum<sup>225,226</sup>, whereas removal of ephrin-A from nasal axons would make them responsive to the repellents in the caudal tectum<sup>225</sup>.

Functional interactions between the Slit/Robo pathway and the chemokine pathway have been found in both leukocytes and neurons. Slit can inhibit chemotaxis of several populations of leukocytes that is induced by all subfamilies of chemokines<sup>11</sup>. This functional inhibition can be reconstituted in mammalian cell lines through the introduction of both Robo and the receptors for chemokines such as Cxcr4 or Sdf1. For several populations of axons in the nervous system, although Sdf1 neither attracts nor repels them, it inhibits their responsiveness to repulsive cues, including Slit and Semaphorin<sup>227</sup>. The biochemical basis for the crosstalk between ‘traditional’ neuronal guidance cues and the chemokines is not well known, although regulation of the Rho GT Pases and cyclic AMP has been suggested as a possible mechanism<sup>11,227</sup>.

Regulation of the Rho GT Pases through the activation of GEFs or GAPs represents a possible integration point for multiple signalling pathways for the different guidance cues<sup>114</sup>. For example, Sema4D stimulates its receptor plexin-B, which associates with PDZRhoGEF and LARG, leading to RhoA activation. Robo also activates the Rho GT Pases, but through the srGAPs. It is likely that most, if not all, axon guidance receptors either directly or indirectly regulate Rho GT Pases by modulating the function of GEFs or GAPs. So, modulation of Rho GT Pases presents a common point for crosstalk among different signalling pathways.

The response of the growth cone to a given guidance cue depends on the intracellular levels of second messengers. Poo’s group has shown that intracellular cyclic nucleotide levels modulate attractive or repulsive axon turning *in vitro*. When the intracellular cAMP level is decreased, netrin induces repulsion rather than attraction in the same growth cone<sup>228</sup>. By contrast, elevation of the cGMP level converts semaphorin-mediated repulsion to attraction. The ratio of cAMP to cGMP is crucial; a high ratio favours attraction, whereas a low ratio favours repulsion<sup>21</sup>. The *in vivo* importance of cAMP modulation has been shown recently in the *Xenopus* retina<sup>30</sup>. Intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels have also been shown to have an important role in modulating the repulsive–attractive response. Reduction of Ca<sup>2+</sup> converts netrin-induced attraction to repulsion<sup>22</sup>. These observations indicate that pathways that modulate intracellular second messages, such as cAMP, cGMP and Ca<sup>2+</sup>, can have profound effects on the response of the growth cone to a given guidance cue, and they provide additional mechanisms for crosstalk between different signalling pathways. One crosstalk mechanism through cAMP has been observed between netrin and the extracellular matrix molecule laminin-1 (REF. 229). Laminin-1 is a cell adhesion molecule that promotes retinal axon growth through the α6β1 integrin. An interesting finding is that, although netrin-1 attracts retinal axons, the presence of laminin-1 can convert this response to

repulsion<sup>229</sup>. This conversion is thought to result from the effect of laminin-1 on lowering the intracellular cAMP concentration<sup>229</sup>.

Evidence for crosstalk between neuronal guidance cues and integrins has also been found. Genetic interactions in *Drosophila* indicate that integrins and their ligands, such as laminin, might positively regulate the responsiveness of growth cones to Slit<sup>230</sup>. In cultured mammalian cells, Slit can induce the binding of Robo to the cell adhesion molecule N-cadherin and can inhibit N-cadherin-mediated cell adhesion<sup>231</sup>. Theoretically, this might provide a mechanism for relative detachment at sites of higher concentrations of Slit, thereby allowing repulsion, although it should be noted that these studies have not been carried out with primary neurons, and the relationship between cell adhesion and guidance might be more complex.

Another potential mechanism for crosstalk could occur at the level of receptor expression, through the modulation of protein synthesis in the axon. Elegant studies by Flanagan’s group reveal that the translation of EphA2 mRNA into the receptor protein is upregulated in the growth cones of commissural axons when they cross the midline of the neural tube<sup>232</sup>. A specific sequence in the 3′-untranslated region of the EphA2 mRNA is responsible for translational regulation in the growth cone<sup>232</sup>. Although the molecular nature of the molecule(s) in the midline is not known, this finding provides a basis for crosstalk between a cue that is secreted from the midline and, at least, the ephrin-Eph pathway.

### Conclusions and future prospects

A combination of genetic, biochemical, molecular and developmental studies has identified several groups of guidance cues and some of their receptors. It is clear that not all guidance molecules have been identified<sup>60</sup>. This line of research will continue to flourish and provide new insights into the mechanisms of neural development. However, a deeper understanding of the guidance mechanisms will require an understanding of the link between receptor activation and cytoskeletal dynamics. Although a general scheme is emerging whereby regulation of the Rho GT Pases is a common event, the intracellular signal transduction mechanisms for the guidance receptors are not well understood. We know more components in some pathways than others, but none of them are yet complete. The diversity of components that are required for semaphorin signalling through different receptors is particularly puzzling.

It is still not possible to answer some basic questions, such as what determines neuronal polarity during migration, how a growth cone or migrating neuron compares receptor activation around its surface when exposed to a guidance cue, and whether and how extracellular gradients are amplified inside the growth cone. It is also not known how different signalling pathways are coordinated, or what are the key components downstream of the Rho GT Pases that are required for neuronal turning. These problems present challenging and exciting topics for future research.
