We identified a novel pathogenicity island in *Staphylococcus aureus* which contains open reading frames (ORFs) similar to the exfoliative toxin (ET) gene, glutamyl endopeptidase gene, and *edin-B* gene in tandem and the phage resistance gene, flanked by *hsdM*, *hsdS* (restriction and modification system), and IS256. The protein encoded by the ET-like gene showed 40, 59, and 68% amino acid sequence identities with exfoliative toxin A (ETA), exfoliative toxin B (ETB), and *Staphylococcus hyicus* ETB (ShETB), respectively. When injected into neonatal mice, the recombinant protein derived from the ET-like gene induced exfoliation of the skin with loss of cell-to-cell adhesion in the upper part of the epidermis as observed in histological examinations, just as was found in neonatal mice injected with ETA or ETB. Western blot analysis indicated that the recombinant protein is serologically distinct from ETA and ETB. Therefore, the product encoded by this new ORF is a new ET member produced by *S. aureus* and is termed ETD. ETD did not induce blisters in 1-day-old chickens. In the skins of mice injected with ETD, cell surface staining of desmoglein 1 (Dsg1), a cadherin type cell-to-cell adhesion molecule in desmosomes, was abolished without affecting that of desmoglein 3 (Dsg3). Furthermore, in vitro incubation of the recombinant extracellular domains of Dsg1 and Dsg3 with the recombinant protein demonstrated that both mouse and human Dsg1, but not Dsg3, were directly cleaved in a dose-dependent manner. These results demonstrate that ETD and ETA induce blister formation by identical pathophysiological mechanisms. Clinical strains positive for *edin-B* were suggested to be clonally associated, and all *edin-B*-positive strains tested were positive for *etd*. Among 18 *etd*-positive strains, 12 produced ETD extracellularly. Interestingly, these strains are mainly isolated from other sources of infections and not from patients with bullous impetigo or staphylococcal scalded-skin syndrome. This strongly suggests that ETD might play a pathogenic role in a broader spectrum of bacterial infections than previously considered.

Exfoliative toxin (ET) is an exotoxin produced by staphylococcal species, causing blisters in human and animal skin (29). ET-producing *Staphylococcus aureus* is involved in staphylococcal scalded-skin syndrome (SSSS), or Ritter disease, and bullous impetigo (33; for a review, see references 21 and 29). SSSS is a generalized blistering skin disease which is primarily a disease of young children and neonates, but adults can also be affected (15). Its clinical manifestations begin abruptly with fever, skin tenderness, and erythema, followed by large sheets of epidermal separation involving the entire skin surface within the next few hours to days. Bullous impetigo is a localized form of SSSS and is frequently seen in older children at the site of infection, especially in the extremities. In SSSS, *S. aureus* is present at distant foci such as the pharynx, nose, ear, or conjunctiva, and ET produced by *S. aureus* gets into the circulation

and causes exfoliation at remote sites, while in bullous impetigo, the bacteria are present in the lesions. Serologically, ETs involved in human diseases mainly consist of two types, ETA and ETB (6, 27). Both toxins cause intraepidermal cleavage through the granular layer, without epidermal necrosis or an inflammatory response of the skin (6, 19, 27). Several lines of evidence have suggested that ETs act as serine proteases to induce intraepidermal cleavage: (i) amino acid sequences of ETA and ETB show similarity with the *S. aureus* V8 serine protease (17), and the catalytic site of V8 protease is conserved in ETA (7); (ii) partially purified ETs preincubated with serine protease inhibitors exhibit delayed skin exfoliation (17); (iii) replacement of the serine residue with glycine in the putative catalytic site of ETA completely abolishes the exfoliative activity of the toxin (35, 38); and (iv) crystal structures of ETA (13, 53) and ETB (52) have recently been determined, and both types were shown to structurally belong to the chymotrypsin family of serine proteases. However, the exact target substrate was a mystery for 30 years, until the pathogenic role of ET was demonstrated in 1970 by using neonatal mice (29). Hints of a breakthrough were provided by studies of the patho-

physiology of pemphigus foliaceus, an autoimmune blistering disease, in which inactivation of the desmosomal cadherin desmoglein 1 (Dsg1) by autoantibodies was shown to cause blisters similar to those observed with SSSS or bullous impetigo (2, 32, 43). This observation led to the recent identification of Dsg1 as the specific substrate for ETA protease (3).

Virulence factors of staphylococci such as ET are accessory proteins which are not essential for cell growth or division. Genetic determinants for these factors are often associated with mobile genetic elements such as phages, plasmids, and pathogenicity islands (9, 30, 34). For instance, genes for ETA (*eta*) (58) and enterotoxins A (10) and E (14) are encoded on prophage genomes in the *S. aureus* chromosome, and genes for enterotoxin D (8), ETB (*etb*) (59), and EDIN-C (59) have been shown to exist on plasmids. The term “pathogenicity island” was first coined to describe large chromosomal virulence-associated segments in uropathogenic *Escherichia coli* (11). Since then, the definition has been broadened to indicate regions, ranging in size from an island of less than 2 kb with a single gene (44) up to a 200-kb island of multigene elements, which have been identified in many species (25). In staphylococcal species, at least three types of pathogenicity islands have been reported (28).

In systematic screening of ET genes in clinical *S. aureus* isolates from diseased patients, we found a strain whose *SmaI*-digested DNA fragment hybridized with probes for *eta*, *etb*, and *edin-B* (the gene for EDIN-B). Here we report the identification and characterization of a novel ET gene, *etd*, from this strain. We demonstrate that the *etd* gene is tandemly encoded in a DNA block with a serine protease gene and the *edin-B* gene, forming a pathogenicity island on the chromosome. Purified recombinant ETD induced exfoliation of the skin of neonatal mice and specifically cleaved Dsg1 as ETA did.

**MATERIALS AND METHODS**

**Bacterial strains and culture conditions.** *S. aureus* TY114 and TY129 were isolated from pus discharged in a cutaneous wound from a patient in the Clinical Laboratory Department in Hiroshima City Hospital. TY67 was a laboratory stock of a clinical isolate from an impetigo patient. Strains positive for *edin-B* were from a stock of clinical strains in M. Aepfelbacher’s laboratory in Munich, Germany (16). *S. aureus* RN4220 and RN450 (*edin-B-*, *eta-*, and *etb*-negative strains) were obtained from Richard Novick and Alexander Tomasz, respectively. Coagulase typing was performed by use of coagulase type-specific antisera (Denka-Seiken, Tokyo, Japan). DNA from *S. aureus* TY114 was cloned into *E. coli* XL-II Blue. *S. aureus* was grown in brain heart infusion broth (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, Mich.) or Trypticase soy broth (TSB) (Becton Dickinson). *E. coli* was grown in Luria-Bertani broth. When necessary, ampicillin (100 μg/ml) or kanamycin (10 μg/ml) was added for selection or plasmid maintenance.

**Materials and chemicals.** TSKgel HA1000 and TSKgel G3000 SW<sub>XL</sub> were purchased from Tosoh, Tokyo, Japan. Lysostaphin was from SIGMA Genosys Japan, Tokyo, Japan. Recombinant ETA with a His tag on the carboxyl-terminal end was expressed in *E. coli* DH10B and recovered from the soluble fraction in lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-Cl [pH 8.0], 0.2 M NaCl, 0.2% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitor cocktail [Complete Mini, EDTA free; Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany]). Extracellular domains of mouse or human Dsg1 and Dsg3 with E tags and His tags on the carboxyl termini were expressed in a baculovirus and collected from culture supernatants as previously described (24). These recombinant ETA and Dsg proteins were purified by using TALON affinity resin (Clontech, Palo Alto, Calif.). Primers used in this study are listed in Table 1. Those for *sea* through *sed*, *edin-B*, and *tst-1* were designed according to the nucleotide sequences deposited in GenBank: *sea*, accession number M18970; *seb*, M11118; *sec*, X05815; *sed*, M94872; *edin-B*, AJ277173; *tst-1*, U93688. Long range PCR was performed with a TaKaRa LA PCR kit (TAKARA Bio Inc.,

Osaka, Japan) according to the following amplification protocol: an initial denaturation step at 96°C for 1 min, 40 s, followed by 30 cycles of 96°C for 20 s of denaturation, 65°C for 16 min, and 72°C for 20 min.

**DNA manipulation.** Routine DNA manipulations were performed by standard procedures (39). Preparation of chromosomal DNA from staphylococcal cells and transformation of *S. aureus* by electroporation were performed as previously described (47). Southern blotting of DNA and hybridization were performed as described previously (46). The nucleotide sequence was determined by using a PRISM Dye Terminator cycle sequencing kit and an automated sequencer (ABI PRISM 310) (both from Perkin-Elmer Japan, Inc., Tokyo, Japan). Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was performed according to standard protocols by using a CHEF DR-II apparatus (Bio-Rad Japan, Tokyo, Japan) (initial switch time, 5 s; final switch time, 40 s; run time, 22 h; voltage gradient, 200 V in Tris-borate-EDTA at 16°C).

**Purification.** Recombinant ETD (the *orfI* product) expressed in *S. aureus* was purified from the culture supernatant as follows. *S. aureus* growing exponentially in TSB was inoculated into 1 liter of the same fresh medium and incubated with continuous agitation by a rotary shaker for 24 h at 37°C. The culture was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min at 4°C. Concentrated culture filtrate (CCF) was prepared by 80% saturated ammonium sulfate precipitation of the culture supernatant. CCF dialyzed against 10 mM phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) (buffer 1) was applied to a hydroxyapatite column (15 by 95 mm) which was equilibrated with buffer 1. The column was washed with buffer 1 until most of the unbound proteins had passed through. Bound proteins were eluted by stepwise elution with 100, 250, and 500 mM phosphate buffer (pH 6.8). The eluate with 100 mM phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) was dialyzed against buffer 1 and concentrated to 500 μl. The sample was loaded onto a TSKgel SW3000<sub>XL</sub> (7.5 by 300 mm; Tosoh) and eluted with buffer 1 at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min, and the active fraction was collected. The active fraction was further applied to a Bio-Scale CHT2-1 hydroxyapatite column (7 by 52 mm; Bio-Rad) and eluted with a linear gradient from 10 to 500 mM phosphate buffer (pH 6.8). For purification of His<sub>6</sub>-tagged ET, primer sets were designed to amplify DNA fragments corresponding to the mature form of ETB or ETD (*orfI*). Amplified DNA fragments were cloned into pQE70 (Qiagen, Valencia, Calif.) in order to express the fusion protein with a His<sub>6</sub> tag sequence at the C terminus in *E. coli*. Recombinant proteins were purified by using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin according to the manufacturer’s protocol.

**Antisera.** The purified protein was emulsified with either Freund complete adjuvant or Freund incomplete adjuvant (Difco Laboratories) (50 μg of protein per ml). For each sample, 2-kg rabbits were immunized on day 1 with the sample emulsified with Freund complete adjuvant and every 2 weeks with the sample emulsified with Freund incomplete adjuvant. At 8 weeks, the rabbits were injected intravenously with 20 μg of the protein sample. Antisera were obtained 15 weeks after the first injection.

**In vivo assay.** To evaluate the exfoliative activity of ETD, neonatal ICR mice (age, <24 h) or 1-day-old chickens were subcutaneously injected with the toxin dissolved in 100 μl of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and the skin was analyzed by eye and microscopically at 1 to 18 h after injection.

**Immunofluorescence.** Cryosections of nonfixed skin from neonatal mice injected with ETD or PBS alone were used for indirect immunofluorescence to localize Dsg1 and Dsg3, as previously described (3). Anti-Dsg1 sera obtained from patients with pemphigus foliaceus and an anti-Dsg3 mouse monoclonal antibody, AK9, which specifically recognizes the extracellular domain of mouse Dsg3 (K. Tsunoda, T. Ota, M. Aoki, T. Yamada, T. Nagai, T. Nakagawa, S. Koyasu, T. Nishikawa, and M. Amagai, unpublished data) were used. Sections were examined under an Eclipse E800 fluorescent microscope (Nikon Corp., Tokyo, Japan).

**In vitro assay.** Approximately 1 μg of purified mouse or human Dsg1 or Dsg3 was incubated overnight at 37°C with the indicated amount of ETD in 50 μl of PBS with 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>. Digested samples were assessed by immunoblot analysis with an anti-E tag mouse monoclonal antibody (Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) for detection of the recombinant proteins.

**Other procedures.** Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and Western blotting (immunoblotting) were carried out as described previously (49). For detection of ETD and EDIN-B in culture supernatants of clinical strains, *S. aureus* was grown in TSB (20 ml) with continuous agitation by a rotary shaker for 48 h at 37°C. CCF was prepared as described above and dissolved in 200 μl of PBS. An aliquot (5 μl) of CCF dialyzed against PBS was subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting. Protein was immunodetected by using Renaissance 4CN Plus (Dupont, NEN Research Products, Boston, Mass.). Protein concentrations were determined with the bicinchoninic acid protein assay reagent (Pierce, Rockford, Ill.) with bovine albumin as the standard. Production of enterotoxin and TSST-1 was assayed by using a

FIG. 1. Schematic representation of the *etd* pathogenicity island. The 9,054 bp of DNA unique to the strain TY114 chromosome, including *orf1*, *edin-B*, and identified ORFs (shaded arrows), is presented. The genetic organization of the putative insertion region of the island on strain N315 chromosomal DNA is shown at the top. Solid arrows, ORFs found in N315.

In the unique sequence obtained, we identified seven protein-coding regions, including *orf1* and *edin-B* (tentatively named *orf1* to *orf7*) (Table 2). The *orf1* product was found to display sequence similarity to ETA and ETB; it showed 40% sequence identity to ETA and 59% sequence identity to ETB (Table 3; Fig. 2). Recently, Sato et al. (40) identified a novel ET from *S*. aureus Horse-1, isolated from a horse with phlegmon, and cloned the gene. They designated it ETC. The *orf1* product showed only 13% sequence identity to ETC. On the other hand, *S*. hyicus has been shown to produce several ETs (5, 41). Of these, genes for two serologically distinct toxins, ShETA and ShETB, have been cloned (54). The *orf1* product showed 16% sequence identity to ShETA and 63% sequence identity to ShETB. Phylogenetic comparison of the *orf1* product with known ETs revealed that the *orf1* product is most similar to ShETB in its primary structure (Fig. 3). The *orf2* product showed a predicted amino acid similarity with glutamyl endopeptidase of *Bacillus intermedius* (37). The *orf7* product exhibited high sequence similarities to phage resistance proteins of *Lactococcus lactis*, such as AbiK (20), and it probably functions as an abortive infection protein against certain phages of *S*. aureus. In the 5′ extremity, a single copy of IS256, which is 1,173 bp long and has terminal inverted repeats of 26 bp (positions 988 to 1013 and 2286 to 2311), is present. The presence of direct repeats of 8 bp in both boundaries of IS256 (positions 980 to 987 and 2312 to 2319) suggests that it was inserted as a single insertion element into the chromosomal DNA. ORFs just downstream of IS256 showed predicted amino acid similarities to the *hsdS* and *hsdM* products, the sequence specificity and modification functions of the type-IC restriction-modification system (26).

Junctions of unique DNA sequence. The junctions of the unique DNA sequences were defined by BLAST searches and PCR. BLAST searches determined that the unique DNA fragment of 9,054 bp (between positions 851 and 9904) was inserted into the chromosome between the ORFs SA2004 and SA2005 on the left and right sides, respectively, and a stretch of 98 bp between positions 2276975 and 2277072 on the N315 chromosome is missing in the unique DNA region (Fig. 4). At both ends of the unique DNA sequence, direct repeats of the pentamer AATTC were present, suggesting that integration of the DNA occurred through a recombination event. We next performed PCR using primers TY85 (on the left of the left junction) and TY86 (on the right of the right junction) based on the known sequences of N315 and Mu50. With a sample of chromosomal DNA from strain TY114 as a template, a PCR product with the expected fragment size of 9.4 kbp was generated by using the LA PCR kit (TAKARA Bio Inc.) (data not shown). In a control PCR using chromosomal DNA from RN450 as a template, a nucleotide product with the expected size of 475 bp appeared (data not shown). These results further support the finding that the unique DNA fragment is present in the chromosome at the specific site between ORFs SA2004 and SA2005 on the left and right sides, respectively, in TY114.

The *orf1* product is a new member of the ETs. To confirm that the *orf1* product actually possesses toxin activity, *orf1* was

selectively affected by ETD in vivo. To demonstrate the direct proteolysis of the extracellular domain of Dsg1 by ETD, we incubated the recombinant protein representing the entire extracellular domain of Dsg1 and Dsg3 with purified ETD in vitro. It cleaved the 81-kDa recombinant mouse Dsg1 down to a 29-kDa peptide in a dose-dependent fashion, but it did not cleave mouse Dsg3 at all (Fig. 8A). It also cleaved recombinant human Dsg1 in the same manner, but not human Dsg3 (Fig. 8B). These findings clearly indicate that ETD selectively recognizes and cleaves the extracellular domain of mouse and human Dsg1 as does ETA.

edin-B-positive strains are positive for etd. We analyzed the genomic fingerprints and genetic and phenotypic characteristics of edin-B-positive strains from Germany and Japan, and we screened edin-B-positive strains for the presence of etd. As shown in Fig. 9, we confirmed that their DNA patterns by PFGE analysis were very similar, as reported previously (16). A DNA fragment of ca. 140 kb hybridized with both the edin-B and etd probes, indicating that all edin-B-positive strains were positive for etd. By performing immunoblotting using antibodies against ETD, we found that the 12 edin-B- and etd-positive strains produced ETD (Fig. 9). Of 18 strains, 16 strains belonged to coagulase type 2 and 2 strains were nontypeable. Southern blot analysis demonstrated that six strains were sec positive and two strains were seb positive (Fig. 9). This is in contrast with the previous observation that strains positive for eta or etb were negative for enterotoxin genes (sea through sed) (60).

DISCUSSION

In this study, we have identified a novel ET gene, *etd*, in a clinical isolate of *S. aureus* and demonstrated that the *etd* gene is located together with a putative glutamyl endopeptidase gene and *edin-B* gene within a unique region of DNA not found in N315, Mu50, or NCTC 8325. According to the concept previously presented (22), we designated this region the *etd* pathogenicity island for the following reasons: (i) the region contains at least three loci possibly associated with virulence, the *etd* gene, the *edin-B* gene, and *orf2*, which shows a predicted amino acid similarity with the glutamyl endopeptidase gene of *B. intermedius* (37); (ii) the *etd* and *edin-B* genes are present in pathogenic but not laboratory strains of *S. aureus*; (iii) IS256 is present near the 5′ border of the DNA region; and (iv) two ORFs, *hsdS* and *hsdM*, encoding the sequence specificity and modification functions (26), are present. *hsdS* and *hsdM* are also present in the reported pathogenicity islands in the chromosomes of *S. aureus* N315 (SaPIN2 and SaPIN3) and Mu50 (SaPIm2 and SaPIm3) (28). It has been suggested that such restriction-modification systems essentially stabilize the maintenance of the linked region (26). As in those pathogenicity islands, the *hsdR* homologue was not present in the *etd* pathogenicity island. The *etd* pathogenicity island was inserted at a chromosomal site between ORF SA2004 and ORF SA2005 of strain N315 (Fig. 1). The G+C content of the island (30.67%) was lower than that of the N315 chromosome, 32.8%, supporting the notion that the DNA region is acquired through a horizontal transfer event.

Purified ETD induced intraepidermal cleavage through the granular layer of the epidermis of neonatal mice which is pathologically indistinguishable from that induced by ETA or ETB. Furthermore, ETD was shown to target Dsg1 but not Dsg3 and to specifically cleave the extracellular domain of Dsg1. ETB has recently been demonstrated to target and cleave Dsg1 but not Dsg3 in vitro and in vivo (4). These results, taken together, indicate that the three ETs share a common target, Dsg1, as the substrate, although their primary amino acid sequences diverged considerably. Therefore, formation of superficial blisters by these toxins can be explained by an identical molecular pathophysiological mechanism through specific digestion of Dsg1 by these toxins. In the epidermis, two isoforms of desmosomal cadherin, Dsg1 and Dsg3, are present, and these proteins possess overlapping functions in cell-to-cell attachment (31, 57). Dsg1 is expressed throughout the epidermis, while Dsg3 is in the lower portion of epidermis (31, 57). Consequently, blistering formation through Dsg1 digestion by ET occurs in a superficial region, namely, in the granular layer, and the lower epidermis is functionally protected by the coexpressed Dsg3. Like ETA and ETB, ETD shows amino acid

FIG. 6. Immunodetection of ET by the anti-mORF1 antibody. Purified recombinant ETA, ETB, and mORF1 were resolved on an SDS–12% PAGE gel and either stained with Coomassie brilliant blue (a) or transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (b through d). The membrane was subjected to immunodetection by an anti-ETA antibody (b), anti-ETB antibody (c), or anti-mORF1 antibody (d). Lanes 1, ETA (0.7 μg); lanes 2, ETB (0.7 μg); lanes 3, mORF1 (0.6 μg).

FIG. 8. In vitro treatment of baculovirus-expressed recombinant desmogleins by ETD. Approximately 1 μg of the purified extracellular domain of mouse (left) or human (right) Dsg1 or Dsg3 produced by a baculovirus was incubated with various concentrations of ETD. The extracellular domain of Dsg1, but not that of Dsg3, was cleaved by ETD in a dose-dependent fashion. Arrows point to the 29-kDa degraded band of Dsg1. Bars on the left side indicate molecular size standards of 150, 100, 50, and 25 kDa (from top to bottom).

identity (23%) to the staphylococcal V8 protease. This identity includes the catalytic triad of the S2 family of serine proteases (36), Ser67-His115-Asp189, which forms the active site of alpha-lytic endopeptidases (12, 18, 36) (Fig. 2). This suggests that ETD is also a glutamyl endopeptidase, but final identification awaits the determination of the cleavage site of Dsg1. It is intriguing that this catalytic triad was not conserved in ETC and ShETA (Fig. 2). Understanding the common mechanism of recognition and digestion of Dsg1 by ETs requires further investigation.

Southern blot analysis of *edin-B*-positive clinical isolates from Germany and Japan demonstrated that all of the *edin-B*-positive strains were positive for *etd*. Furthermore, most of them secreted both ETD and EDIN-B (16) into the culture supernatant. EDIN is another exotoxin produced by *S. aureus*. There are at least three types of EDIN isoforms, EDIN-A (23), EDIN-B (C3stau) (56), and EDIN-C (59), produced by *S. aureus*. The prototype of this toxin family, EDIN-A, was initially discovered as an inhibitor of morphological differentiation of epidermal keratinocytes in vitro and was designated epidermal cell differentiation inhibitor (EDIN) (45). It was later shown to be a mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase that specifically inhibits eukaryotic small GTP-binding proteins belonging to the Rho family (48) and is now regarded as a member of the large family of bacterial Rho-specific mono-ADP-ribosyltransferases, the C3 family (55). Rho GTPases are central regulators of the eukaryotic actin cytoskeleton (32, 50, 51), and their inactivation by toxins and modulins of virulent bacteria has been shown to block important cellular functions (1). It has previously been demonstrated that *etb* and *edin-C* are collocated on an ETB plasmid (59). In this study, *edin-B* and *etd* are shown to be localized in the same locus on the chromosome. These results suggest the close association of these genes during evolution. Despite its presumed importance in virulence, the exact role of EDIN in the pathogenesis of *S. aureus* remains to be elucidated.

DNA fingerprinting and coagulase typing further suggested that *etd*-positive and *edin-B*-positive strains are clonally associated. ET has been considered a relatively simple virulence factor that causes blistering, and it has been well accepted that ET-producing strains are associated with bullous impetigo and SSSS. However, to our surprise, all of the German strains in this study were isolated not from impetigo lesions but from

FIG. 9. PFGE and genotypic and phenotypic characterizations of *edin-B*-positive *S. aureus* strains. *SmaI*-digested DNA of *edin-B*-positive strains was subjected to PFGE and was run on agarose gels. Gels were subjected to Southern hybridization with probes for detecting genes of interest. DNA fragments that hybridized with the probe for detecting the gene of interest are boxed in green (*etd* and *edin-B*), yellow (*seb*), or red (*sec*). The hybridization signals for *edin-B* and *etd* corresponded to the same ca. 140-kb DNA fragment, and that for an enterotoxin gene (*seb* or *sec*) corresponded to a 320- to 350-kb DNA fragment. At the bottom, results of coagulase serotyping and data on production of ETD, EDIN-B, enterotoxin, and TSST-1 are summarized. Production of ETD and EDIN-B was assessed by immunoblotting as described in Materials and Methods. Production and serotyping of enterotoxins and TSST-1 were assayed by using the SET-RPLA and TST-RPLA detection kits, respectively. NT, nontypeable.

other sources of infection (16). Two of the three isolates from Japan, including the original strain, TY114, were from pus discharged from skin wounds, and the other isolate was from an impetigo patient. We screened 88 *S. aureus* strains isolated from lesions of impetigo patients for *etd* and found only one strain positive for *etd* and *edin-B* (data not shown). These results suggest that the strains belonging to this clonal group are not strongly associated with the onset of bullous impetigo, although most of them produce an active ET, ETD. Our study raises the possibility that ET might play a broader pathogenic role in a variety of infections than previously considered, e.g., it might function in such a way that it destroys epithelial barriers, thus helping the bacteria to spread or to invade the tissues for the exacerbation of infection. Further epidemiological study of ETD- and EDIN-B-producing *S. aureus* and a comparative genomic study of this clonal group with those causing blistering diseases in humans may identify the pathological function of ETD in *S. aureus* infection.
