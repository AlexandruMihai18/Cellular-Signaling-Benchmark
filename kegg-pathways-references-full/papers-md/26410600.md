Regulation of Axonal Transport by Protein Kinases

Katherine L. Gibbs,¹ Linda Greensmith,¹ and Giampietro Schiavo¹,*


The intracellular transport of organelles, proteins, lipids, and RNA along the axon is essential for neuronal function and survival. This process, called axonal transport, is mediated by two classes of ATP-dependent motors, kinesins, and cytoplasmic dynein, which carry their cargoes along microtubule tracks. Protein kinases regulate axonal transport through direct phosphorylation of motors, adapter proteins, and cargoes, and indirectly through modification of the microtubule network. The misregulation of axonal transport by protein kinases has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several nervous system disorders. Here, we review the role of protein kinases acting directly on axonal transport and discuss how their deregulation affects neuronal function, paving the way for the exploitation of these enzymes as novel drug targets.


Axonal Transport in Neuronal Function and Survival

Neurons are highly polarized cells, with axons that can reach over a meter away from the cell body in large mammals. This unique morphology makes neurons particularly dependent on active intracellular transport along the axon. Axonal transport is essential for the delivery of newly synthesized proteins, lipids, and RNA, as well as organelles, to growth cones and synapses. It is also required for the removal of damaged cellular components and organelles for degradation and recycling. Furthermore, axonal transport has been shown to play a key role in long-distance communication between the distal region of the axon and the cell body, including neurotrophic and injury response signaling [1–3] and the regulation of axonal length [4]. Congruent with the crucial role of axonal transport in neuronal homeostasis, disruptions in axonal transport have been linked to neuronal dysfunction and degeneration [5,6].

The complex spatial and temporal regulation of axonal transport is essential for controlled delivery of selected cargoes (see Glossary) to specific neuronal domains. Whilst a complete understanding of axonal transport regulation is still lacking, it has been known for some time that phosphorylation plays an important role in this process [7,8]. However, deciphering which protein kinases are responsible for axonal transport modulation has been difficult, as kinase cascades display considerable crosstalk and play multiple roles in neuronal homeostasis [9–12]. Recently, significant progress has been made in dissecting out the role of individual kinases in this process and identifying their molecular targets.

Protein kinases are known to regulate axonal transport through direct phosphorylation of motors, adapter proteins, and cargoes, and indirectly through modification of the microtubule network. The diversity of protein kinases implicated in axonal transport regulation most likely underlies the complexity of this process and explains why transport characteristics are distinct between different types of neurons (e.g., axonal transport is slower in sensory versus motor neurons) [13] and cargoes (e.g., mitochondria move bidirectionally with frequent pauses, whilst signaling endosomes undergo sustained retrograde transport) [13,14].

Here, we review the role of protein kinases that have been implicated in the direct regulation of axonal transport and discuss how kinase deregulation can affect neuronal function.

## The Axonal Transport Machinery

Axonal transport can be classified based on the speed at which cargoes move. Vesicles, organelles, and RNA are transported by fast axonal transport at a speed of 50–200 mm/day (0.5–3 μm/s), whilst cytoskeletal components (such as neurofilaments and tubulin) and some soluble proteins are transported by slow axonal transport and move at rates of 0.1–3 mm/day [6].

Both types of transport are mediated by two classes of ATP-dependent motors – kinesin and cytoplasmic dynein – which carry their cargoes along microtubule tracks running the length of the axon [15]. Kinesin and dynein are assisted by adapter proteins, which link the motors to their cargoes and regulate the activity of the motors. Microtubules impart an intrinsic polarity to neurons, with their ‘plus’ ends located at the axon tips and their ‘minus’ ends within the cell body (Figure 1, Key Figure). This polarity confers directionality to axonal transport.

### Anterograde Axonal Transport

Anterograde axonal transport refers to the movement of cargoes from the cell body towards the axon tips and is mediated by kinesin motor proteins.

**Figure 1.** Kinesin-1 and cytoplasmic dynein mediate the transport of organelles, RNA, lipids, and proteins along the axon. Kinesins mediate microtubule-dependent anterograde transport from the cell body towards the axon tip, whilst cytoplasmic dynein powers retrograde transport from the cell periphery back to the cell body. Anterograde and retrograde axonal transport are regulated by several protein kinases, including glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3β), extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (p38 MAPK), c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK), cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5), Akt, protein kinase A (PKA), protein kinase C (PKC), PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1), and casein kinase 2 (CK2). Plus (+) and minus (−) refer to the polarity of axonal microtubules.

**Glossary**

- **Cargo:** organelles, vesicles, RNA, or proteins that are carried by molecular motor complexes along microtubules.
- **Microtubules:** polymers of tubulin that extend throughout axons and dendrites and form the tracks along which molecular motors move. Microtubules are polarized in axons, conferring directionality to axonal transport.
- **Neurofilaments:** a type of intermediate filament found specifically in neurons. Neurofilaments are composed of three major subunits: light (NF-L), medium (NF-M), and heavy (NF-H). They are thought to provide structural support for axons, regulate axon diameter, and act as a scaffold for various axonal components.
- **Protein kinase:** an ATP-dependent enzyme (phosphotransferase) that adds a phosphate group to its protein substrate. Phosphorylation typically causes a functional change in the substrate, such as altering its activity, cellular location, or association with other proteins.
- **Squid axoplasm:** extruded cytoplasm of the giant axons of the squid *Loligo pealeii*. Differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy is used to observe the bidirectional movement of membrane-bound organelles in real time. Axoplasm can be perfused with recombinant proteins and small molecular inhibitors to determine their effects on axonal transport.

Box 1. The Structure of Kinesin-1 and Dynein/Dynactin Motor Complexes

Kinesin-1. Structural studies have revealed that kinesin-1 is a rod-shaped protein, with globular heads connected by a stalk to a tail domain. The carboxy terminal domains of the two KIF5 subunits associate with two KLCs and mediate cargo binding. The amino terminal globular heads of KIF5 form the motor domains and contain ATP and microtubule-binding sites. Kinesin-1 is able to take steps along the microtubule by alternately detaching and advancing each of its two globular heads [104]. High-resolution X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy of kinesin-1 in complex with tubulin in both ATP-bound and nucleotide-free states have provided insights into how the motor moves [104]. ATP binding to the ‘front’ motor domain not only allows high-affinity binding to microtubules but also triggers conformational changes in the ‘rear’ globular head that allows it to detach from microtubules and take a step. Steps are driven by conversion of the neck linker domain from a disordered state to a well-defined structure.

Cytoplasmic dynein/dynactin. Dynein is composed of two heavy chains (DHCs) and additional intermediate (DICs), light intermediate (DLICs), and light chains (DLCs). The carboxy terminal region of DHC consists of a ring of six putative AAA⁺ ATPase domains (AAA1–6). ATP binding to AAA1 lowers the affinity of the microtubule-binding domain for microtubules so that the DHC can detach and diffuse to its next binding site. ATP hydrolysis induces remodeling of the linker domain and allows the motor to complete the step [105]. The amino terminus of the DHC mediates dimerization and binding to DICs, DLICs, and DLCs to form the cargo-binding domain. DICs contain the dynactin-binding region. Dynactin consists of eight core subunits: p150Glued, dynamitin/p50, Arp1, Arp11, p62, p24, p25, and p27 [106]. A dimer of p150Glued forms a bridge between the dynein intermediate chain and microtubules that is believed to increase motor processivity. Dynamitin/p50 overexpression inhibits dynein-mediated axonal transport by causing the release of p150Glued and p24, thus disrupting the dynein–dynactin complex [107]. BICD2 is required to stabilize the interaction between dynein and dynactin, allowing the processive movement of the complex [108].

Kinesin-1 motors are responsible for the fast anterograde axonal transport of most vesicles, organelles, proteins, and RNA particles and the slow axonal transport of cytoskeletal proteins. Kinesin-1 family members are heterotetramers composed of two heavy chains (KIF5A–C) and two light chains (KLC1/2). KIFs comprise the motor domains and contain both ATP and microtubule-binding motifs. KLCs interact with the tails of the KIFs and are thought to regulate cargo binding and motor activity [16] (Box 1).

Kinesin-2 and kinesin-3 motors are also important for axonal transport. Members of the kinesin-2 family (KIF3A/KIF3B/KAP3) mediate the transport of late endosomes and lysosomes [17,18], whilst kinesin-3 motors (KIF1A and KIF1Bβ) carry synaptic vesicle precursors and dense core vesicles [19,20].

Retrograde Axonal Transport

Retrograde axonal transport refers to the movement of cargoes from the axon tips to the cell body and is mediated by cytoplasmic dynein. Dynein is composed of two heavy chains and additional intermediate, light intermediate and light chains [15]. The heavy chain contains ATP and microtubule-binding motifs at its carboxy terminus, whilst the amino terminus interacts with the additional chains to form the cargo-binding domain. Dynein is found in a complex with dynactin [16], a multi-subunit cofactor that is essential for its function (Box 1), and other adapter proteins, such as lissencephaly-1 (Lis1) and huntingtin (htt) [6].

Kinases Implicated in the Regulation of Axonal Transport

Protein kinases regulate axonal transport through direct phosphorylation of motors, adapters, and cargoes (summarized in Table 1). Importantly, protein kinases also phosphorylate several factors involved in the regulation of microtubule stability, as discussed in detail elsewhere [21].

Glycogen Synthase Kinase-3 Beta (GSK3β)

GSK3β was originally identified as a regulator of glycogen metabolism [22], but has since been shown to be a multifunctional kinase with numerous roles in the nervous system [9]. In both invertebrate and rodent models, GSK3β acts as a negative regulator of anterograde and retrograde axonal transport (Figures 2 and 3) [23–28]. In *Drosophila*, overexpression of GSK3 inhibits the axonal transport of mitochondria [24,25], amyloid precursor protein (APP)-containing vesicles

Protein kinases that have been shown to regulate the anterograde transport of specific cargoes are listed. Their molecular targets are indicated in parentheses.

[27], and lipid droplets in larval segmental nerves [27]. There are conflicting views over whether GSK3 also inhibits the axonal transport of synaptic vesicles in these nerves [25,27]. Stimulation of GSK3β by pathological proteins, such as presenilin 1 and amyloid beta (Aβ) (see section on Relevance to central nervous system function and disease) also inhibits bidirectional axonal transport in mammalian neurons [29,30] (Table 1).

Pharmacological inhibition of GSK3β in hippocampal and sensory (dorsal root ganglion, DRG) neurons has been shown to stimulate the axonal transport of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-containing secretory vesicles, mitochondria, and acidic organelles [24,28]. Similar results are also seen in *Drosophila* larval segmental nerves carrying loss-of-function mutations in GSK3 [27]. However, in squid axoplasm, inhibition of GSK3β did not alter the axonal transport of membrane-bound organelles [26], indicating that this regulatory mechanism is not conserved between all species.

GSK3β regulates axonal transport through direct phosphorylation of motors and their adapters. In squid axoplasm, GSK3β was shown to phosphorylate KLC2, stimulating its release from cargoes, without influencing the microtubule binding or ATPase activity of the motor [26]. However, optical trap experiments in *Drosophila* indicate that GSK3β may instead act to reduce the number of active kinesins working at any one time, rather than the total number of motors bound to the cargo [27]. These contrasting results may represent differences in the regulation of axonal transport between species. GSK3β directly phosphorylates dynein intermediate chain 1B (DIC1B) and 2C (DIC2C), leading to inhibition of the retrograde axonal transport of acidic organelles [28]. GSK3β-mediated phosphorylation of DIC1B was shown to reduce its interaction with Ndel1 and Lis1, which enhance dynein force production [31].

GSK3β has also been shown to regulate axonal transport through phosphorylation of motor adapter proteins. Collapsin response mediator protein-2 (CRMP-2) acts as a linker between kinesin-1 and specific cargoes such as tubulin heterodimers and TrkB-containing endosomes

[32]. GSK3β-mediated phosphorylation of CRMP-2 disrupts its association with KLC1 and is proposed to perturb the anterograde axonal transport of its cargoes [33] (Figure 2). However, this effect has yet to be demonstrated in live axonal transport assays.

Finally, GSK3β has been found to have differential effects on slow axonal transport, depending on the type of cargo being transported. For example, GSK3β directly phosphorylates tau [34], increasing its affinity for kinesin-1 and thereby accelerating its anterograde axonal transport [35]. By contrast, GSK3β-mediated phosphorylation of neurofilament heavy chain (NF-H) increases neurofilament bundling and reduces their anterograde axonal transport [36].

### Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases (MAPKs)

MAPKs are serine/threonine protein kinases that coordinate cellular responses to diverse extracellular stimuli. In its simplest form, MAPK signaling can be considered as a cascade of three tiers of protein kinases: MAPK kinase kinases (ASK1, TAK1, RAF1, MLK, MEKK4), MAPK kinases (MEK1, MKK4/7, and MKK3/6), and MAPKs (ERKs, JNKs, and p38 MAPKs). However, representing the MAPK cascade as three isolated pathways is an oversimplification; the MAPK signaling network functionally interacts with many other pathways via shared scaffolding proteins, which target them to specific cellular locations [37]. In addition, there are several isoforms of each MAPK, each with distinct functions [37].

#### ERK1/2

Extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2, also known as p44/42 MAPK) are activated in response to mitogens and growth factors, including neurotrophins [38], and have been shown to play a key role in neuronal differentiation, plasticity, and survival [39,40]. ERK1/2 directly phosphorylate both kinesin-1 (Figure 2) and dynein (Figure 3), and thereby regulate their association with cargoes [41,42]. In rodent cortical neurons, ERK1/2-mediated phosphorylation of DIC1B and DIC2C increases the association of dynein with TrkB/Rab7-positive signaling endosomes, leading to an increase in the number of signaling endosomes moving in the retrograde direction (Figure 3) [42]. Interestingly, phosphorylation of DIC1B and DIC2C by ERK1/2 does not alter the ability of dynein to bind to mitochondria in these neurons, suggesting
that mitochondria utilize a different mechanism to recruit dynein [42]. By contrast, ERK1/2-induced phosphorylation of KLC1 at Ser460 prevents binding of the motor to APP-labeled vesicles [41,43], leading to a decrease in their anterograde transport frequency (Figure 2) [41]. ERK1/2-mediated phosphorylation of KLC1, however, has no effect on the axonal transport of other cargoes, such as CRMP2 or the neurotrophin receptor scaffolding protein Kidins220/ARMS [41]. This suggests that ERK1/2 only mediate the fast retrograde axonal transport of specific cargoes.

Interestingly, activated ERK1/2 are also cargoes of signaling endosomes and are transported to the cell body where they induce changes in neurotrophin-dependent gene expression [44]. This raises the question of how the transport machinery is protected from unwanted modification by transported kinases. Although the exact mechanism is currently unknown, it could be speculated that the interaction of ERK1/2 with vimentin, which prevents dephosphorylation and deactivation of the kinases [45], could also preclude ERK1/2 from phosphorylating the transport machinery en route.

ERK1/2 have also been shown to facilitate the slow anterograde axonal transport of neurofilaments [36]. ERK1/2 attenuate GSK3β-mediated bundling of neurofilaments, leading to an increase in their transported pool [36]. However, ERK1/2 activity has no effect on the slow axonal transport of tau, indicating that this regulatory mechanism is also cargo-specific [46].

### p38 MAPKs

p38 MAPKs are activated in response to proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) and interleukin (IL)-1β, and cellular stresses, such as hypoxic, genotoxic, or oxidative stress [47]. There are four p38 MAPK isoforms: α, β, γ, and δ. p38 MAPKα and β are considered to be the major isoforms expressed in the central nervous system [48].

p38 MAPK is a negative regulator of both fast and slow axonal transport. In squid axoplasm, p38 MAPKα directly phosphorylates KIF5C at Ser175/Ser176 and thereby inhibits the fast anterograde axonal transport of membrane-bound organelles (Table 1) [48]. By contrast, p38 MAPKβ inhibits both anterograde and retrograde axonal transport in this system [48]. p38 MAPK-mediated inhibition of fast axonal transport has also been described for mitochondria in rodent hippocampal neurons [48,49] and synaptic vesicles in *Drosophila* segmental nerves [50] (Figures 2 and 3), suggesting that this regulatory mechanism is conserved between species. However, the targets of this kinase in the mammalian transport machinery are presently unknown.

Activation of p38 MAPK has also been shown to inhibit the slow anterograde axonal transport of neurofilaments [51]. p38 MAPKα phosphorylates the tail domains of neurofilament medium (NF-M) and NF-H chains and regulates their attachment to motor proteins [52]. In rat cortical neurons, increased phosphorylation of NF-M and NF-H slows their axonal transport and induces bundling, leading to large accumulations of neurofilaments in the cell body and proximal axons [53].

### JNKs

The c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs) are encoded by three genes: JNK1 and 2 are expressed ubiquitously, while JNK3 is only expressed in neurons [11]. Similar to p38 MAPK, JNKs are activated by cellular stress and proinflammatory cytokines [54]. In addition to their physiological roles in neuronal development and synaptic plasticity, overactivation of JNKs has been implicated in several neurological disorders [11].

JNKs regulate axonal transport via direct phosphorylation of motors, adapter proteins, and cargoes. In squid axoplasm, JNK3 inhibits fast anterograde axonal transport via direct phosphorylation of KIF5C at Ser176, reducing kinesin-1 function and its ability to bind to microtubules[Trends in Biochemical Sciences](https://www.cell.com/trends/biochemical-sciences)

[55, 56]. Activation of JNK also inhibits the axonal transport of synaptic vesicles and mitochondria in rodent hippocampal neurons (Figures 2 and 3) [57]. In these studies, JNK was found to directly phosphorylate KIF5B and induce its dissociation from microtubules [57]. The mechanism responsible for JNK-mediated inhibition of retrograde axonal transport remains unclear (Figure 3).

JNK also regulates fast axonal transport via phosphorylation of JNK-interacting protein 1 (JIP1). JIPs not only act as signaling platforms for JNKs [58] but also serve as adapter proteins for both dynein and kinesin [59, 60] (Figures 2 and 3). In rodent neurons, phosphorylation of JIP1 at Ser421 stabilizes its interaction with kinesin-1 and promotes the anterograde axonal transport of APP, whilst expression of a non-phosphorylatable JIP1 mutant favors retrograde axonal transport [60]. Thus, JNK-mediated phosphorylation of JIP1 could act as a molecular switch between retrograde and anterograde axonal transport [60].

Similar to ERK1/2, JNK is also a signaling endosome cargo and its retrograde axonal transport is essential for the response to axonal injury [61]. Given the inhibitory effect of JNK on retrograde axonal transport, there must be additional regulatory mechanisms in place to allow its processive transport along the axon. It has been suggested that JIP-1 modulates JNK signaling during transport via association with protein phosphatases [62]. For example, JIP1 has been shown to bind the dual-specificity phosphatase MAPK phosphatase 7 (MKP7), which dephosphorylates and inactivates JNK [63].

Finally, JNK1 has been shown to negatively regulate slow anterograde axonal transport. In chick sensory neurons, JNK1 was found to directly phosphorylate neurofilaments, leading to inhibition of their slow axonal transport [64].

### Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 5 (Cdk5)
Cdk5 was first discovered based on its sequence homology to other cyclin-dependent kinases such as Cdc2 and Cdk2 [65, 66]. However, unlike other cyclin-dependent kinases, Cdk5 does not play a direct role in cell cycle control. Instead, Cdk5 regulates several processes in the nervous system, including neurite outgrowth, synaptic activity, and neuronal migration [12], and its deregulation has been linked to neurodegeneration [67, 68].

The role of Cdk5 in the regulation of axonal transport is controversial, with dispute over whether the kinase regulates axonal transport under normal conditions or only in response to cellular stress. In squid axoplasm and *Caenorhabditis elegans* motor neurons, inhibition of Cdk5 was reported to disrupt the anterograde axonal transport of membrane-bound organelles [69, 70] and secretory vesicles (Figure 2) [71]. Similarly, expression of kinase-dead Cdk5 led to inhibition of both anterograde and retrograde axonal transport of acidic organelles in rodent DRGs (Figure 3) [72]. Experiments in squid axoplasm suggest that Cdk5 regulates axonal transport indirectly via inhibition of GSK3β (see GSK3β section) [70]. Cdk5 has been shown to activate lemur tyrosine kinase-2 (LMTK2), which in turn phosphorylates and activates protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), thus preventing GSK3β activation [70, 73, 74]. Cdk5 has also been described to regulate fast retrograde axonal transport through phosphorylation of the dynein adapter protein Ndel1. In rodent DRGs, phosphorylation of Ndel1 by Cdk5 increases its association with Lis1, leading to enhanced retrograde axonal transport of acidic organelles (Figure 3) [72].

However, a more recent study performed in rodent DRGs has failed to reproduce these results. In this study, expression of kinase-dead Cdk5 did not affect the axonal transport of lysosomes, mitochondria, or TrkB-containing endosomes [75], suggesting that Cdk5 does not play a role in the regulation of axonal transport under normal conditions. By contrast, increasing Cdk5 activity disrupted the axonal transport of these cargoes [75], suggesting that Cdk5 modulates axonal

Cdk5 has also been shown to negatively regulate the slow anterograde axonal transport of neurofilaments [36,46,76,77]. Phosphorylation of neurofilaments by Cdk5 is proposed to disrupt their anterograde axonal transport by promoting bundling [36,78], reducing binding to kinesin [79], and inhibiting the activity of ERK1/2 through phosphorylation-mediated deactivation of its upstream activator MEK1 [46]. Cdk5 also disrupts the slow anterograde axonal transport of tau, although the mechanism responsible remains unclear [46].

Crucially, the level of crosstalk between different kinases known to phosphorylate neurofilament subunits remains to be addressed, together with the physiological implications of the resulting combinatorial phosphorylation patterns.

### Akt

The serine/threonine kinase Akt (also known as protein kinase B) has been shown to regulate the directionality of fast axonal transport. Activation of Akt in rodent hippocampal neurons leads to the preferential anterograde axonal transport of BDNF-containing secretory vesicles, APP-containing vesicles, and synaptic vesicles through phosphorylation of the adapter protein htt (Figure 2) [80]. Akt-mediated phosphorylation of htt at Ser421 increases the recruitment of kinesin-1 to vesicles and also increases the amount of kinesin heavy chain bound to microtubules [80]. Inhibition of Akt causes an increase in the rate of retrograde axonal transport of BDNF-containing vesicles (Figure 3) [80]. Akt can also inactivate GSK3β and thereby release the inhibitory effect of GSK3β on the fast axonal transport of mitochondria in hippocampal neurons [24,81]. It will be interesting to determine whether these regulatory mechanisms are conserved across species and neuronal types.

### Additional Kinases Implicated in the Regulation of Axonal Transport

There is a small body of evidence implicating other protein kinases in the regulation of axonal transport (Figure 1). In invertebrate models, both protein kinase A (PKA) and casein kinase 2 (CK2) inhibit fast anterograde axonal transport via direct phosphorylation of kinesin and reduction of its affinity for vesicular cargoes [19,82]. In addition, CK2 has been shown to inhibit retrograde axonal transport via an unknown mechanism [82].

However, these findings have not been confirmed in mammalian neurons. In contrast to its effects in an invertebrate model [19], PKA has been shown to facilitate the fast axonal transport of mitochondria in rodent DRGs (Figures 2 and 3) [83]. It is unclear whether this reflects a difference in regulatory mechanisms between species or between different cargoes (mitochondria versus vesicular cargoes).

Protein kinase C (PKC) has been demonstrated to be a negative regulator of both retrograde [84] and anterograde [85] fast axonal transport, but further work is required to confirm the PKC isoform(s) responsible, their target(s), and the mechanism of action at the molecular level.

Finally, overexpression of PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1) has been shown to inhibit the bidirectional axonal transport of mitochondria through phosphorylation of the adapter protein Miro (Figures 2 and 3), which targets it for degradation [86].

### Relevance to Central Nervous System Function and Disease

The regulation of axonal transport by protein kinases is essential for neuronal function and development. This mechanism has been shown to play an essential role in regulating axon integrity during pathfinding [87], establishing neuronal polarity [88], and regulating synaptic

formation and maintenance [69]. Protein kinases also play a key role in the regulation of growth factor and stress signaling [90,91] and the supply and clearance of proteins, lipids, and organelles to the distal axon and synapse [27,49,80]. It is therefore not surprising that the deregulation of axonal transport by protein kinases has been implicated in several nervous system disorders (Table 2).

### Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)

The early appearance of axonal transport deficits in ALS mouse models [13,92] suggests that they play a key role in disease pathogenesis. p38 MAPK is overactivated in spinal motor neurons of an ALS mouse model (SOD1${}^{\text{G93A}}$) [48,93] and is responsible for defects in fast anterograde axonal transport induced by ALS-associated SOD1 mutants [48]. In addition, deregulation of p38MAPK and Cdk5 is linked to the hyperphosphorylation of neurofilaments and subsequent disruption of their slow axonal transport observed in ALS [51,53,93,94].
### Huntington's Disease (HD)

Mutant huntingtin (polyQ-htt) stimulates JNK3-mediated phosphorylation of KIF5C and induces deficits in both anterograde and retrograde axonal transport in squid axoplasm [56]. Interestingly, Akt-mediated phosphorylation of polyQ-htt at Ser421 can restore fast axonal transport to wild-type levels [95].

### Alzheimer's Disease (AD)

Aβ is proposed to inhibit fast axonal transport through Akt inhibition [96] and activation of CK2 [82], GSK3β [29, 96, 97], and p38 MAPK [49]. AD-associated presenilin 1 mutations and hyperphosphorylated tau have also been shown to induce axonal transport defects through activation of GSK3β [25, 96, 98]. Correcting fast axonal transport defects by reducing GSK3β activity was found to be beneficial in a *Drosophila* model of AD [99, 100]. Deregulation of Cdk5 is also linked to defects in the slow axonal transport of neurofilaments in AD [77].

### Spinal Bulbar Muscular Atrophy (SBMA)

SBMA is caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the first exon of the androgen receptor (polyQ-AR). Perfusion of the polyQ-AR in squid axoplasm inhibits the fast axonal transport of membrane-bound organelles through stimulation of JNK3-mediated phosphorylation of the kinesin heavy chain [55]. However, the role of axonal transport deficits in SBMA is controversial, since alterations in axonal transport were not found *in vivo* in a mouse model of SBMA expressing endogenous levels of polyQ-AR [101].

### Charcot–Marie–Tooth Type 2F (CMT2F)

CMT2F-mutant HSPB1 has been shown to induce alterations in the slow anterograde axonal transport of neurofilaments [79]. Mutant HSPB1 activates Cdk5, leading to neurofilament bundling and reduced association with kinesin-1.

Overactivation of protein kinases and the subsequent disruption of axonal transport are a common occurrence in neurodegenerative diseases [102]. However, the direct demonstration that kinase-induced disruptions in axonal transport trigger disease pathogenesis is still lacking. The identification of pharmacological inhibitors of key protein kinases, such as GSK3β, JNK3, and p38 MAPK, able to restore their activity to basal levels and normalize axonal transport, will help answer this question and determine whether protein kinases represent effective therapeutic targets for neurodegenerative diseases.

### Concluding Remarks and Future Perspectives

The complex scenario emerging from these studies highlights the crucial role played by protein kinases in the modulation of axonal transport. Motors, adapters, and cargoes are key targets for differential regulation by phosphorylation; something we are only just beginning to understand. Many intriguing questions still remain to be answered (see Outstanding Questions).

Given the key role that axonal transport plays in neuronal function, it is not surprising that alterations in protein kinase activity disrupt the axonal transport of selected cargoes and may lead to the severe pathological features of many nervous system disorders. Protein kinases may therefore represent key therapeutic targets for several neurological diseases that currently lack effective therapies. However, targeting protein kinases in neurological diseases presents several challenges [103]. In particular, there are likely to be problems with off-target effects, as protein kinases are often involved in the regulation of many cellular processes and participate in multiple signaling pathways. Understanding how to control the phosphorylation of specific substrates will aid the design of novel kinase inhibitors with fewer off-target effects.

### Outstanding Questions

- Do kinases other than ERK1/2 and GSK3β directly phosphorylate cytoplasmic dynein? What effects does this process have on axonal transport?
- Do protein kinases phosphorylate the dynactin complex and, if so, how does this affect the activity and processivity of the dynein motor?
- Are kinesin-2 and -3 regulated by direct phosphorylation as seen for kinesin-1?
- Is the axonal transport of RNA also regulated by protein kinases? Which aspects of the regulatory network are shared between the different classes of organelles?
- What are the molecular mechanisms underlying the deregulation of protein kinases in neurodegenerative diseases and how is axonal transport affected?
- Can we specifically target protein kinases and axonal transport as a therapeutic strategy for neurodegenerative diseases and other disorders of the nervous system?
