all of these actions of estrogen could be ascribed to its binding to its “classical” intracellular receptor and to alterations in gene transcription. However, we now know that this steroid hormone activates multiple signaling pathways to affect neuronal excitability and gene transcription. Although the “classical” genomic signaling pathway has been recognized for almost half a century, until recently little attention has been paid to the rapid membrane-initiated signaling by estrogen in neurons. It has been known since the 1970s that estrogen can rapidly alter neuronal firing within seconds, indicating that some cellular effects of estrogen could occur via rapid, nontranscriptional mechanisms. Therefore, this chapter reviews the current status of estrogen signaling in the hypothalamus via membrane-initiated and nuclear-mediated events that affect the excitability of hypothalamic neurons and, ultimately, neuroendocrine and autonomic functions. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

I. HYPOTHALAMUS AND FEEDBACK OF E₂ ON THE HYPOTHALAMIC–PITUITARY AXIS

The quintessential role of estrogen in the mammalian brain is its negative and positive feedback actions on the hypothalamic–pituitary axis to regulate the reproductive cycle of the female. At the hypothalamic level, estrogen acts on the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) cell network that includes GnRH output neurons and the presynaptic neurons (e.g., GABA, glutamate, β-endorphin neurons) that synapse onto GnRH neurons. Estrogen acts as a homeostatic feedback messenger between the gonads and the hypothalamus to dictate the biosynthetic and secretory activity of GnRH neurons. For most of the ovarian cycle, estrogen restrains luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion through its negative feedback actions. This occurs, in part, through an inhibition of GnRH secretion (*Caraty et al.*, 1989; *Chongthammakun and Terasawa*, 1993; *Evans et al.*, 1994; *Sarkar and Fink*, 1980), and these effects of E₂ are mediated both directly on GnRH neurons (*Abraham et al.*, 2003, 2004; *Kelly et al.*, 1984; *Lagrange et al.*, 1995) and indirectly via GABA and opioid interneurons (*Herbison*, 1997; *Herbison and Dyer*, 1990; *Herbison et al.*, 1991; *Wagner et al.*, 2001). Disruption of this feedback loop by ovariectomy results in rising levels of LH and follicle-stimulating hormone within 1 or 2 days. Restoring the feedback loop with doses of exogenous E₂, which mimic follicular concentrations of E₂, results in a rapid (<20–30 min) decline in plasma gonadotropin levels. Estrogen also exhibits a positive feedback influence on the GnRH network to generate a significant increase in GnRH neurosecretion that induces a preovulatory surge of LH (*Moenter et al.*, 1990; *Pau et al.*, 1993; *Sarkar and Fink*, 1980). This LH surge occurs 36–48 hours after administering estrogen in ovariectomized female primates and

guinea pigs (Levine *et al.*, 1985; Terasawa *et al.*, 1979; Tsai and Yen, 1971; Yamaji *et al.*, 1972). Therefore, the multifaceted effects of E₂ on the hypothalamic GnRH cell network are time and dose dependent. However, it is important to keep in mind that estrogen’s effects on the hypothalamus act in concert with its actions in the pituitary to ensure a single ovulatory event that is precisely timed.

In addition to its effects on the reproductive axis, estrogen has a plethora of actions on a number of other homeostatic processes controlled by the hypothalamus. For example, it is well documented that estrogen is involved in the regulation of appetite, energy expenditure, and body weight in females (Geary, 2001; Milewicz *et al.*, 2000; Poehlman, 2002). Ovariectomy induces an increase in food intake and decreases ambulatory and wheel-running activities in rodents, which is reversed with estrogen replacement (Ahdieh and Wade, 1982; Asarian and Geary, 2002; Colvin and Sawyer, 1969; Shimomura *et al.*, 1990). The anorectic effects of estrogen are thought to be mediated through hypothalamic sites of action based on the findings that direct injections of E₂ into the paraventricular nucleus or arcuate/ventromedial nucleus versus other brain areas are the most effective in reducing food intake and body weight and increasing activity (wheel running) in females (Ahdieh and Wade, 1982; Butera and Czaja, 1984; Colvin and Sawyer, 1969). Therefore, these studies indicate that hypoestrogenic states are associated with decreased activity and increased body weight in females.

The role of E₂ in energy homeostasis is further substantiated through studies of mutant mice with targeted disruption of the aromatase (ArKO) and estrogen receptor α (ERαKO) genes (Couse and Korach, 1999; Geary *et al.*, 2001; Jones *et al.*, 2000). Both male and female ArKO mice gain weight, and the weight gain is abrogated in females with E₂ treatment (Jones *et al.*, 2000). In general, studies in ERαKO animals have found that both males and females gain fat deposits at the expense of muscle mass, but only noncastrated males gain in body weight relative to their wild-type littermates (Couse and Korach, 1999; Heine *et al.*, 2000; Vidal *et al.*, 1999). However, E₂-treated, ERαKO mice are similar to oil-treated, ovariectomized wild-type littermates in terms of gaining excessive weight, indicating that ERα gene expression is involved in the estrogen control of feeding and weight regulation of female mice (Geary *et al.*, 2001). However, the differences between the ArKO (estrogen-deficient) mice and the ERαKO (receptor-deficient) mice indicate that other ERs are also involved.

Two critical hypothalamic neuronal populations involved in feeding include the arcuate NPY and POMC neurons. Activation of NPY neurons increases feeding in rodents, whereas POMC activity inhibits feeding (Spiegelman and Flier, 2001). Furthermore, ovariectomy increases arcuate NPY mRNA expression, which is reversed with estrogen replacement (Shimizu *et al.*, 1996). In contrast, estrogen given to ovariectomized females up-regulates the expression of immunoreactive β-endorphin in POMC
neurons, indicative of increased synthetic activity (Bethea *et al.*, 1995; Thornton *et al.*, 1994). POMC is processed stoichiometrically to melanocyte-stimulating hormone and $\beta$-endorphin, and both peptides are known to inhibit feeding via the melanocortin 3 and 4 receptors for melanocyte-stimulating hormone, and the $\mu$-opioid receptor for $\beta$-endorphin (Appleyard *et al.*, 2003; Butler *et al.*, 2001; Fan *et al.*, 1997; Huszar *et al.*, 1997). Clinically, there is a decrease in hypothalamic $\beta$-endorphin content in the hypothalamus during menopause, which correlates with weight gain in postmenopausal women who do not receive hormone replacement (Leal *et al.*, 1998). Therefore, it appears that arcuate nucleus, and specifically NPY and POMC neurons, are major targets for the anorectic actions of estrogen.

Estrogen also feeds back on the hypothalamus to modulate the activity of neurons involved in thermoregulation. Changes in body temperature are “sensed” by the thermoregulatory center in the preoptic/anterior hypothalamus, which controls the physiological responses that conserve or dissipate heat such as skin vasodilation, skin vasoconstriction, and shivering. Hot flushes, which are a subjective sensation of heat associated with cutaneous vasodilation and a subsequent drop in core temperature, are correlated with low estrogen levels, such as in the menopausal state (Stearns *et al.*, 2002). Because of the causal association between hot flushes and estrogen depletion, hormone replacement therapy with estrogenic compounds has been the linchpin of treatment for hot flushes. In addition, hot flushes can be accompanied by sweating, palpitation, anxiety, and even panic (Stearns *et al.*, 2002). Interestingly, selective serotonin uptake inhibitors, which are prescribed for postmenopausal depression, are also efficacious in treating hot flushes, which is indicative of the overlap between serotonin receptor signaling and ER signaling in hypothalamic neurons (Qiu *et al.*, 2003).

Estrogen is also involved in modulating stress responses. Females, and in particular postmenopausal women, have a higher incidence of depression and stress-related disorders (Carrasco and Van de Kar, 2003; Fink *et al.*, 1996). Clinical trials indicate that E₂ replacement therapy is efficacious for the treatment of depression (Carrasco and Van de Kar, 2003). In animal models, E₂ appears to reduce fear-related behaviors (Handa *et al.*, 1994). Ovariectomy reduces stress-induced secretion of ACTH from the pituitary gland and corticosterone from the adrenal gland, and E₂ replacement restores the “normal” stress response in these females. Based on c-Fos mRNA expression in the PVN in response to stress in the presence of E₂ and the colocalization of ER$\beta$ in CRH and AVP neurosecretory neurons, the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus appears to be a critical site for estrogen’s actions (Handa *et al.*, 1994; Hrabovszky *et al.*, 1998; Laflamme *et al.*, 1998; Yukhananov and Handa, 1996).
ESTROGEN SIGNALING IN THE HYPOTHALAMUS

II. TRANSCRIPTIONAL SIGNALING OF ESTROGEN IN HYPOTHALAMIC NEURONS

In general, the classical signaling pathway of estrogen involves steroid-dependent formation of nuclear ER homo- or heterodimers and the interaction of this complex with consensus palindromic estrogen response elements (EREs) in E₂-responsive gene promoters (Fig. 1) (O'Malley and Tsai, 1992). The two inverted, palindromic half sites are separated by three intervening nucleotides that vary in nucleotide sequence (–GGTCA**nnn**TGACC–). The subsequent recruitment of other nuclear coactivator and coregulatory proteins and interactions with the transcription machinery results in

![Figure](attachment:figure.png)

FIGURE 1. E₂ signaling via estrogen receptor α (ERα), ERβ, and mER. These pathways are compartmentalized in this hypothalamic neuron. (A) E₂ binds to its intracellular receptor (ERα or ERβ), leading to dimerization and translocation to the nucleus, where interaction of the activated ER with EREs in the promoter region causes new transcription and subsequent translation into protein that are critical for neuronal function. The intracellular receptors can also interact with insulin-like growth factor 1 to alter cell functions. (B) E₂ binds to a membrane-associated estrogen receptor (ERα or ERβ) that is associated with signaling molecules (e.g., ras-raf 1-MEK or PI3K) in caveolae or lipid rafts that, once activated, cause multiple downstream effects in hypothalamic neurons, including altered gene transcription. (C) Estrogen binds to a G protein-coupled mER that is coupled to phospholipase C-PKC activation, which has multiple downstream effects including Ca²⁺ mobilization from intracellular stores, up-regulation of adenyl cyclase activity, and subsequent PKA activity. PKA can phosphorylate a cAMP-responsive element binding protein (pCREB), which can cause gene activation via CREs.
transactivation of genes that contain consensus EREs (Fig. 1). This generates specific nuclear mRNA transcripts that are processed and exported to the cytoplasm, where the mRNA is translated into protein. An example of the critical role of this classical signaling pathway in mediating estrogen’s actions in the hypothalamus is the stimulation of progesterone receptor synthesis following estrogen treatment in ovariectomized females, which is critical for the preovulatory surge of GnRH (Chappell and Levine, 2000; Malyala et al., 2004). Also, long-term treatment (48 h) with E₂ increases oxytocin receptor mRNA expression in the ventromedial hypothalamus, which is crucial for the expression of female sexual and maternal behavior (Bale et al., 1995; Quiñones-Jenab et al., 1997). In addition, E₂ increases adrenergic α₁b receptor mRNA and protein and hence potentiates β-adrenergic-stimulated cAMP formation in the preoptic area—a region that is also involved in female sexual behavior (Karkanias et al., 1996; Petitti and Etgen, 1990; Petitti et al., 1992). Therefore, E₂ via EREs regulates a number of genes in the hypothalamus that are critical for reproduction and autonomic functions.

However, a number of hypothalamic genes are clearly estrogen responsive, yet do not contain ERE sequences (Malyala et al., 2004; Mong et al., 2003). There is compelling evidence that intracellular ERs (ERα and ERβ) can regulate transcription of some of these “estrogen-responsive” genes by interacting with DNA-binding proteins such as specificity protein 1 (SP-1) and activator protein 1 (AP1) rather than binding directly to DNA (Paech et al., 1998). There are also “indirect” genomic actions of estrogen that do not require nuclear targeting of ERs and are therefore classified as “non-genomic” actions of estrogen in the hypothalamus (see Kelly and Levin, 2001). New gene transcription can result from E₂ activation of multiple intracellular kinase cascades including Src, Ras, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), cAMP-protein kinase (PKA), and protein kinase C (PKC) pathways (Fig. 1). For example, estrogen binding to its intracellular receptors or a novel membrane ER (mER) can upregulate cAMP in hypothalamic neurons by increasing adenyl cyclase activity (Lagrange et al., 1997). Cyclic-AMP activates PKA, which in turn phosphorylates cAMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB) (Gu et al., 1996; Zhou et al., 1996). Therefore, genes with CRE binding sites can be activated within a relatively short time course in hypothalamic neurons independent of ERs interacting with EREs. This results in up-regulation of neurotransmitter genes, such as oxytocin, dopamine, enkephalin, dynorphin, neurotensin, and vasopressin expression, that are critical for hypothalamic functions (Bale et al., 1995; Gu et al., 1996; Shapiro et al., 2000; Watters and Dorsa, 1998). In hypothalamic (mouse) GnRH neurons, the rapid phosphorylation of CREB following E₂ treatment is observed in ERα but not in ERβ knockout mice, indicating a role for ERβ in the gene activation by pCREB in GnRH neurons (Abraham et al., 2003).There is compelling evidence for the rapid activation of MAPK by E₂ via either its intracellular receptors or a novel membrane ER (Cardona-Gómez et al., 2002; Singer et al., 1999; Singh et al., 1999, 2000; Toran-Allerand et al., 2002). ERα or a putative membrane receptor (ERX) can stimulate phosphorylation of the insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) receptor that activates extracellular related kinase (ERK) 1 and ERK2 in the hypothalamus as well as other brain areas (Cardona-Gómez et al., 2002; Singh et al., 1999, 2000; Toran-Allerand et al., 2002). In cultured GH3 (somatolactotroph) cells, E₂ causes a rapid, transient tyrosine phosphorylation of Raf-1 to activate MAPK, independent of Src activation, which leads to increased expression of prolactin (Watters et al., 2000). Estrogen activates a similar MAPK pathway in developing hypothalamic neurons (primary hypothalamic cultures) to cause neurite outgrowth during development, comparable to brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Carrer et al., 2003). These effects are blocked by MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126 but not PI3 kinase inhibitor LY294002. Interestingly, the SERM tamoxifen or the ER antagonist ICI 182,780 do not block these actions of E₂, which may indicate that an ER pharmacologically distinct from ERα or ERβ is involved. In addition, E₂ conjugated to bovine serum albumin (BSA) (E₂-BSA), which limits the access of the steroid to the outer plasma membrane, is effective in producing neurite outgrowth, indicating that a membrane ER is likely involved in mediating these effects of E₂ (Carrer et al., 2003). Therefore, there is a high correlation between MAPK activity and increased gene expression in hypothalamic neurons.

Finally, estrogen's activation of phospholipase C-PKC can affect a number of downstream signaling cascades including PKA and MAPK (Fig. 2). Estrogen activation of protein kinase C can affect not only hypothalamic neuronal electrophysiological activity but also lead to new gene transcription (Ansonoff and Etgen, 1998; Kelly et al., 1999; Qiu et al., 2003). The latter effects can be directly via ERE-mediated mechanisms (Ansonoff and Etgen, 1998; Etgen, 2002) or via membrane-initiated signaling (Qiu et al., 2003). At least in breast cancer cells, phorbol esters that activate PKC can also affect ERα-dependent transcriptional activity by increasing the phosphorylation of the classical receptor (Lannigan, 2003). Furthermore, PKC (e.g., PKCβ) can activate the Ras-Raf-MEK1/2-ERK1/2 signaling pathway to increase gene transcription (Marais et al., 1998; Widmann et al., 1999).

### III. MEMBRANE-INITIATED SIGNALING BY ESTROGEN IN HYPOTHALAMIC NEURONS

In contrast to intracellular signaling, there are membrane-delimited signaling events that are initiated by steroid binding to a membrane receptor. For example, it was discovered in the early 1940s that progesterone and several of its metabolites cause rapid sedation and anesthesia, providing the
FIGURE 2. G protein-coupled estrogen signaling in hypothalamic neurons that leads to rapid changes in electrophysiological activity and longer-term changes in synthetic activity. E₂ activates a mER that is Gαq-coupled to activation of phospholipase C that catalyzes the hydrolysis of membrane-bound phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate (PIP₂) to inositol 1,4,5 triphosphate (IP₃) and diacylglycerol (DAG). Calcium is released from intracellular stores (endoplasmic reticulum) by IP₃, and DAG activates protein kinase C δ (PKCδ). Through phosphorylation, adenylyl cyclase VII (ACVII) activity is upregulated by PKC. The generation of cAMP activates PKA, which can rapidly uncouple μ-opioid (μ) and GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors from their effector system through phosphorylation of a downstream effector molecule (e.g., the inwardly rectifying K⁺ channel, or GIRK). In addition, the α₁-adrenergic receptor is Gαq-coupled to the phosphatidylinositol pathway to activate PKC and PKA to phosphorylate other K⁺ channels and inhibit their activity, and this inhibition is potentiated by E₂ in hypothalamic neurons (Wagner et al., 2001). ER-mediated modulation of kinase pathways either reduces the capacity of neuromodulators such as β-endorphin (β-End) and GABA to inhibit hypothalamic neuronal excitability or augments the ability of neurotransmitters such as norepinephrine (NE) to increase neuronal excitability. Finally, in GnRH neurons, mER is Gαi-coupled to activation of GIRK channels. Over the long term, rapid ER-mediated activation of PKA can lead to phosphorylation of cAMP-responsive element binding protein (pCREB), which can then alter gene transcription through its interaction with the cAMP responsive element (CRE). Therefore, the “short-term” and “long-term” effects of E₂ are not mutually exclusive because the PKC–PKA pathway can also alter gene expression in an estrogen-response element–independent fashion.

first evidence for “nongenomic” actions of steroids (Selye, 1941). As a result, a class of steroidal anesthetics, and in particular alphaxalone, was developed and used clinically in Great Britain (Ramsey et al., 1994). However, it was another 40 years before the potent and stereospecific potentiation of the GABAA-mediated response in rat brain neurons by 3α-hydroxy reduced metabolites of progesterone and deoxycorticosterone was documented
(Harrison and Simmonds, 1984). These “neuroactive” steroids interact allosterically with the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor/channel complex, similar to the benzodiazepine drugs, to augment Cl<sup>-</sup> currents (Lambert et al., 1995; Majewska, 1992). In addition to potentiation of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor-mediated response, neuroactive steroids (in particular pregnenolone and pregnenolone sulfate) can rapidly (1–4 min) inhibit N- and L-type calcium channel activity in hippocampal neurons (Ffrench-Mullen et al., 1994).

In the early 1960s and into the 1970s a number of studies suggested that estrogen directly modulates the electrical activity of hypothalamic neurons (Barraclough and Cross, 1963; Bueno and Pfaff, 1976; Cross and Dyer, 1970; Dufy et al., 1976; Dyer et al., 1972; Kubo et al., 1975; Lincoln, 1967; Lincoln and Cross, 1967; Moss and Law, 1971; Whitehead and Ruf, 1974; Yagi, 1970, 1973; Yagi and Sawaki, 1971). Most of these studies correlated changes in single-unit activity of preoptic-hypothalamic neurons with the estrous cycle of the rat, or measured changes in activity following systemic injection of estrogen. Although the studies were correlative in nature, they did give some indication that estrogen could alter neuronal activity within a very short time frame, similar to neurotransmitters. However, the first clear evidence for a rapid membrane effect of 17β-estradiol (E<sub>2</sub>) was demonstrated by iontophoretic application of an estrogen ester (17β-estradiol hemisuccinate) with a microelectrode that simultaneously recorded extracellular neuronal activity (Kelly et al., 1976, 1977a, 1977b, 1978a, 1978b). E<sub>2</sub> rapidly altered neuronal firing within seconds in about one-third (34%) of all medial preoptic neurons of the female rat. This E<sub>2</sub>-induced inhibition of spontaneous activity was stereospecific (17α-estradiol had no effect) and occurred at low picomolar concentrations. In addition, it was found that estrogen could antagonize the excitatory actions of neurotransmitters on preoptic neurons, indicating a postsynaptic modulation of neurotransmitter actions (Kelly et al., 1977a). However, direct membrane application of estrogen via iontophoresis could not determine with certainty the specific target cell on which E<sub>2</sub> acted (i.e., on a cell presynaptic to the recorded cell or directly on the cell itself) to alter electrical activity.

On the basis of the extracellular recording studies, it was hypothesized that some of the estrogen-responsive preoptic neurons were GnRH neurons because they were antidromically identified as projecting to the median eminence (Kelly et al., 1977a). Subsequently, it was possible, using intracellular recording techniques, to demonstrate that fast perfusion of low concentrations of E2 (100 pM) could hyperpolarize arcuate neurons in a hypothalamic slice preparation within seconds, and that this effect reversed within minutes of washing out estrogen (Kelly et al., 1980; Lagrange et al., 1995). Similar actions of E<sub>2</sub> were demonstrated in hypothalamic ventromedial nucleus and amygdala neurons, even in the presence of protein synthesis inhibitors (Minami et al., 1990; Nabekura et al., 1986). Subsequently, it was found that GnRH neurons were a target of these estrogen actions using adouble-labeling technique that employed intracellular labeling with procion yellow, followed by immunocytochemical staining with a GnRH antisera (Kelly *et al.*, 1984). The E₂-mediated hyperpolarization of hypothalamic and amygdala neurons appears to be the result of the opening of an inwardly rectifying K⁺ channel based on the reversal potential (at the predicted Nernst equilibrium potential for K⁺) and the characteristics of the current/voltage plots (Kelly *et al.*, 1980, 1984; Lagrange *et al.*, 1995; Nabekura *et al.*, 1986). Furthermore, it was determined that E₂ hyperpolarizes GnRH neurons, via opening of a K⁺ channel, which potently inhibited action potential firing (Kelly *et al.*, 1980, 1984; Lagrange *et al.*, 1995; Nabekura *et al.*, 1986), It is thought that the rapid effects of E₂ in GnRH neurons are responsible, in part, for estrogen’s negative feedback on the reproductive axis (Kelly and Lagrange, 1998; Kelly *et al.*, 1984; Lagrange *et al.*, 1995). It may be that the ER mediating these effects is directly coupled via a G protein (Gαᵢ) to K⁺ channels (Fig. 2). Further evidence for the Gαᵢ coupling of ERs in GnRH neurons comes from studies in GT1-7 cells (immortalized GnRH neurons) in which E₂ rapidly inhibits cAMP production via a pertussis toxin-sensitive mechanism (Navarro *et al.*, 2003). Furthermore, coimmunoprecipitation studies showed that E₂ stimulates the interaction between an ER and Gαᵢ₃ (Navarro *et al.*, 2003). Interestingly, over a longer time course (>24 h), E₂ reduces K⁺ channel (transient outward current) activity in GnRH neurons, corresponding to positive feedback effects of estrogen (DeFazio and Moenter, 2002).

Estrogen has both inhibitory and excitatory effects on ventromedial neurons, depending on the cell type (Minami *et al.*, 1990). In one hypothalamic ventromedial nucleus cell type that expresses a low-threshold Ca²⁺ spike, E₂ (10 nM) hyperpolarizes the cell membrane by opening a K⁺ channel, similar to GnRH neurons. In another hypothalamic ventromedial nucleus cell type that expresses a transient outward K⁺ current, E₂ (10 nM) depolarizes the membrane by decreasing a resting K⁺ conductance (Minami *et al.*, 1990). The depolarizing effects of E₂ are mimicked by 8-bromo-cAMP application (i.e., cAMP mediated), which would indicate the coupling of an ER to Gαₛ. Because the ventromedial nucleus is critical for sex behavior in the female, these effects of estrogen may be involved in the lordosis reflex circuitry (Pfaff, 1980).

Another target of estrogen’s rapid actions are the β-endorphin neurons that originate in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus, synapse directly on GnRH neurons (Chen *et al.*, 1989; Thind and Goldsmith, 1988) and are an integral component of estrogenic negative feedback on the hypothalamic–pituitary axis (Ferin *et al.*, 1984). Indeed, administration of opiate antagonist naloxone blocks the E₂ negative feedback and can advance the LH surge in women (Rossmanith *et al.*, 1988). μ-Opioid receptor activation (e.g., by β-endorphin or by selective μ-opioid agonists) mimics E₂ negative feedback on GnRH/LH release and has been shown to directly hyperpolarize, andthereby inhibit, GnRH neurons via opening a G protein-activated inwardly rectifying potassium channel (GIRK) (Lagrange *et al.*, 1995). In addition, GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors are coupled to the same population of GIRK channels in hypothalamic neurons (Lagrange *et al.*, 1996). Brief (<20 min) application of E<sub>2</sub> *in vitro* results in a fourfold decrease in the potency of the μ-opioid receptor agonists and GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor agonists to inhibit β-endorphin neurons (Lagrange *et al.*, 1994, 1996). This effect of E<sub>2</sub> is antagonized by the ER antagonist ICI 164,384 with a subnanomolar affinity that is similar to ICI's affinity (K<sub>i</sub>) for ERα (Weatherill *et al.*, 1988). Estrogenic modulation of the μ-opioid and GABA<sub>B</sub> agonists potency is mimicked either by stimulation of adenylyl cyclase with forskolin or by direct PKA activation with Sp-cAMP, in a concentration-dependent manner (Lagrange *et al.*, 1997; Qiu *et al.*, 2003). Furthermore, the selective PKA antagonists KT5720 and Rp-cAMP block the effects of E<sub>2</sub>. In contrast, the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide is without effect on the ER-mediated actions. More recent data indicate that PKA is downstream in a signaling cascade that is initiated by a Gα<sub>q</sub>-coupled membrane ER that is linked to activation of phospholipase C–protein kinase C–protein kinase A in β-endorphin and dopamine neurons (Fig. 2) (Qiu *et al.*, 2003). This membrane ER is distinct from intracellular receptors on the basis that a novel selective ER modulator, STX, does not bind to either ERα or ERβ and is more potent than estrogen in uncoupling μ-opioid and GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors in hypothalamic β-endorphin and dopamine neurons (Fig. 2) (Qiu *et al.*, 2003). Therefore, E<sub>2</sub> through a Gα<sub>q</sub>-mediated pathway rapidly decreases the potency of μ-opioid and GABA<sub>B</sub> ligands at their receptors, thus increasing β-endorphin release and inhibiting neurons that receive synaptic input from these neurons (e.g., GnRH neurons).

In addition, it has been found in hypothalamic neuronal explants that E<sub>2</sub> causes a rapid (within 30 min) increase in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations in GnRH neurons (Temple *et al.*, 2004). These effects are not mimicked by 17α-estradiol or E<sub>2</sub>-BSA and are blocked by ICI 182,780, indicating a specific interaction of E<sub>2</sub> with an intracellular receptor, possibly ERβ, as it is expressed in GnRH neurons. The specific signaling mechanism has not been identified, but the findings indicate that E<sub>2</sub> mobilizes intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> through a inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP<sub>3</sub>)-mediated mechanism. Thus, it appears that E<sub>2</sub> can signal via at least three different G proteins (Gα<sub>i</sub>, Gα<sub>q</sub>, and Gα<sub>s</sub>) in hypothalamic neurons.

## IV. COUPLING OF A MEMBRANE ESTROGEN RECEPTOR TO SIGNALING CASCADES

Specific binding of \[^{3}\]H]-estradiol to synaptosomal membranes from rat brain was first demonstrated in the early 1980s (Towle and Sze, 1983). However, this report was met with some skepticism, even though severallabs had demonstrated rapid, specific membrane effects of E₂ in the hypothalamus that matched the pharmacodynamics of this E₂ receptor (Dufy *et al.*, 1979; Kelly *et al.*, 1980; Nabekura *et al.*, 1986; Teyler *et al.*, 1980). In addition, specific binding sites for E₂ had been reported for endometrial cell membranes (Pietras and Szego, 1977, 1979). However, the field was bolstered in the mid-1980s when it was discovered that neurosteroids like tetrahydroprogesterone and tetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone potentiated GABA-mediated Cl⁻ current by binding to specific cites on the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor/channel complex (Harrison and Simmonds, 1984; Harrison *et al.*, 1987; Lambert *et al.*, 1995; Majewska, 1992; Majewska *et al.*, 1986). Furthermore, a G-protein coupled corticosteroid receptor was identified in synaptic membranes from the brains of the amphibian *Taricha granulosa* (Evans *et al.*, 2000; Orchinik *et al.*, 1991, 1992). Finally, the original observation of selective binding of the gonadal steroids to rat synaptosomal membranes was corroborated by another lab, using the membrane impermeant 17β-estradiol-6-[¹²⁵I]-BSA (E₂-[¹²⁵I]-BSA) (Zheng and Ramirez, 1997). Competition binding assays on synaptosomal membranes from three different areas—hypothalamus, olfactory bulb, and cerebellum—showed specific binding, with the hypothalamus showing the highest-affinity binding site (3 nM) (Ramirez and Zheng, 1996; Ramirez *et al.*, 1996). Similar to the electrophysiological data, 17α-estradiol did not compete even at micromolar concentrations, indicating a high degree of specificity (Kelly *et al.*, 1977b; Ramirez *et al.*, 1996).

In GH3/B6 pituitary tumor cells, E₂ rapidly induces intracellular release of Ca²⁺ and influx of Ca²⁺ through voltage-gated Ca²⁺ channels precedent to prolactin secretion (Dufy *et al.*, 1979; Pappas *et al.*, 1994; Watson *et al.*, 1999). On the basis of confocal laser microscopy of the binding of E₂-BSA, selective antibodies to ERα (e.g., H222), and ERα antagonists, the membrane receptor in these pituitary cells appears to be ERα or an isoform of ERα (Norfleet *et al.*, 1999, 2000; Pappas *et al.*, 1995; Watson *et al.*, 1999). One of the more problematic questions, however, is how ERα or ERβ interpolate with the membrane and couple to G proteins/intracellular cascades, as there are no obvious membrane-spanning regions for the classical steroid receptor. One idea is that a posttranslational modification of ERα (ERβ) could occur in the endoplasmic reticulum, thereby facilitating the movement, possibly with a transporter protein, into the membrane (Levin, 1999). In Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with ERα and ERβ cDNAs, the receptors have been found to be associated with the plasma membrane and to couple with G proteins (Gα<sub>s</sub>, Gα<sub>q</sub>) to activate many of the cellular cascades, and the association of ERs with caveolin appears to be critical for this coupling (Razandi *et al.*, 1999, 2003). In these transiently transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells, nanomolar concentrations of E₂ rapidly stimulate IP₃ production (phospholipase C pathway) or adenylyl cyclase activity, which indicates that the membrane-associated ERα andER$\beta$ can couple to G$\alpha_{q}$ (inositol phosphate pathway) and G$\alpha_{s}$ (cAMP pathway), respectively. The ER antagonist ICI 182,780 inhibited the ability of E$_{2}$ to stimulate IP$_{3}$ production but not cAMP production. Therefore, it is clear that ER$\alpha$ and ER$\beta$ can couple to multiple G-protein pathways in cell lines. Membrane ERs have been shown to be associated with caveolae in endothelial cells (Chambliss and Shaul, 2002) and with “caveolar-like” microdomains (e.g., lipid rafts), which have been identified in neocortical neurons from immature rats (Toran-Allerand *et al.*, 2002). However, in the neocortex and hypothalamus, the G protein-coupled membrane ER appears to be distinct from the intracellular ERs (Qiu *et al.*, 2003; Toran-Allerand *et al.*, 2002).

The diversity of ER coupling is further highlighted by the fact that E$_{2}$ activation of MAPK cascade in cortical neurons is linked to the neuroprotective effects of E$_{2}$ in the brain (Singer *et al.*, 1999; Singh *et al.*, 1999, 2000). Estrogen, within minutes, elicits activation of MAPKs, which are inhibited by the MAPK inhibitor PD98059 but not by ER antagonist ICI 182,780. Recently, it has been shown that E$_{2}$ can activate the MAP kinase cascade in cortical neurons from ER$\alpha$ knock-out mice (Singh *et al.*, 2000; Toran-Allerand *et al.*, 2002). Also, E$_{2}$ rapidly activates MAP kinase in a human neuroblastoma cell line that synthesizes GnRH (SK-N-SH cells) (Watters *et al.*, 1997). Again, these actions are mimicked by E$_{2}$-BSA and are not blocked by the antagonist ICI 182,780. These actions of estrogen in hypothalamic and cortical neurons are thought to be critical for the growth and survival of the neurons (Garcia-Segura *et al.*, 2001; Toran-Allerand *et al.*, 1999). The idea that estrogen could be neuroprotective in hypothalamic neurons is interesting to consider because hypoestrogenic states (e.g., in postmenopausal women) are accompanied by a loss of $\beta$-endorphin (POMC) neurons and subsequent decrease in autonomic functions (Abel and Rance, 1999).

### V. CROSS-TALK BETWEEN E$_{2}$ SIGNALING WITH OTHER SIGNALING CASCADES

As a signaling molecule, E$_{2}$ probably exhibits the greatest cross-talk with neurotransmitter and growth-factor signaling pathways in the hypothalamus. E$_{2}$ binding to its intracellular receptors or a membrane ER can upregulate cAMP in hypothalamic neurons, which activates PKA, and rapidly phosphorylate CREB, which means that the genes with CRE binding sites can be activated within a relative short time course (Gu *et al.*, 1996; Zhou *et al.*, 1996). Likewise, treatment of cells with epidermal growth factor or IGF-1 increases ER$\alpha$ and ER$\beta$ transcriptional activity. Both ER$\alpha$ and ER$\beta$ can be phosphorylated by MAPK/ERK, which results in enhanced transcriptional activity. In addition, growth factors can signal to ER$\alpha$ via the
serine/threonine kinase Akt (also known as protein kinase B). Akt kinase activity is dependent on PI3K, which is activated by epidermal growth factor or IGF-1 in hypothalamic neurons (Cardona-Gómez *et al.*, 2002). Estrogen, when given systemically to ovariectomized female rats, increases the phosphorylation of ERK and Akt, and E₂ plus IGF-1 act synergistically to increase Akt phosphorylation in the hypothalamus (Cardona-Gómez *et al.*, 2002; Mendez *et al.*, 2003). In addition, estrogen treatment induces the formation of a multimolecular complex between ERα, the IGF-1 receptor and PI3K in the hypothalamus (Mendez *et al.*, 2003). These rodent studies have been corroborated by experiments in human SK-N-SH neuroblastoma cells that secrete GnRH (Watters *et al.*, 1997). Estrogen or E₂-BSA rapidly activate MAPK, and subsequently c-Fos, in these neuroblastoma cells. Moreover, E₂ is known to up-regulate c-Fos expression in native GnRH neurons at the time of the ovulatory surge of LH in the rat, although the specific signaling pathway is not known (Hoffman *et al.*, 1990; Lee *et al.*, 1990, 1992). It has been proposed that activation of PKC and PKA via a membrane ER is necessary for full manifestation of lordosis (sex) behavior in female rats, which is governed by GnRH neuronal activity (Fig. 2) (Kow and Pfaff, 2004; Vasudevan *et al.*, 2001).

Probably one of the most unique interactions in the hypothalamus is crosstalk between astrocytes and GnRH neurons, which is involved in sexual development and reproductive function. In addition to the feedback of estrogen on the complex GnRH neuronal network mentioned earlier, estrogen facilitates astrocyte–GnRH neuron communication by several mechanisms (Ojeda and Ma, 1999; Rage *et al.*, 1997). First, E₂ increases the astrocytic expression of transforming growth factor α, which reaches a maximum during the first preovulatory surge of gonadotropins. Second, E₂ increases the expression of erbB (tyrosine kinase) receptors in the astrocytes, thereby allowing transforming growth factor α to act in an autocrine/paracrine manner. Transforming growth factor α stimulates the release of prostaglandin E₂ from the astrocytes, which increases the release of GnRH (Ma *et al.*, 1997). Finally, estrogen augments the prostaglandin E₂-stimulated release of GnRH by increasing the expression of the prostaglandin E₂ receptors EP1 and EP3 in GnRH neurons, which are coupled to calcium mobilization and stimulation of cAMP formation, respectively (Rage *et al.*, 1997). Thus, by facilitating an interaction between astrocytes and neurons, estrogen can augment GnRH release at critical times during reproductive development.

VI. CONCLUSIONS

It has been known for some time that estrogen regulates gene transcription through its binding and activation of ERα (ERβ), translocation to the nucleus, and activation of transcription via binding to an estrogen-
responsive element on the DNA in hypothalamic (and CNS) and peripheral cells. Therefore, E₂ up-regulates or down-regulates the expression of many different mRNAs ([Malyala et al., 2004](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molbrainres.2003.12.015); [Mong et al., 2002](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0928-4257(02)00034-9)). However, it is now clear that the genomic activation by E₂ can occur independent of its receptor interaction with ERE in specific genes. Also, it should be emphasized that many of the rapid, membrane-initiated signaling effects of E₂ in the hypothalamus (and other brain regions) cannot be attributed to ERα or ERβ on the basis of electrophysiological experiments in neurons that do not express these receptors, or in transgenic mice that have these receptors deleted (ERKO mice). For example, E₂ potentiates glutamatergic (kainate) currents in hippocampal CA1 neurons in ERα KO mice in the presence of the estrogen antagonist ICI 182,780 ([Gu et al., 1999](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0896-6273(00)81426-1)) Likewise, in human embryonic kidney (HEK 293) cells expressing the ionotropic 5-hydroxytryptamine type 3 (5-HT₃) receptor, E₂ inhibits the serotonin-induced inward cation current via an allosteric interaction with the 5-HT₃ receptor ([Wetzel et al., 1998](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0006-3495(98)77717-0)). However, although the membrane-associated ER couples to a number of signaling pathways to rapidly alter membrane properties in the hypothalamic neurons (Fig. 2), its exact identity is still unknown. In addition, there are many examples in the hypothalamus for rapid upregulation of PKC, PKA, PI3K, and MAPK activity that leads to altered synthetic and neurosecretory activity in hypothalamic neurons (Fig. 1). Therefore, there is the potential that many more neurons in the hypothalamus are “estrogen-responsive” neurons independent of gene activation through EREs. As the complexity by which multiple pathways converge on the genome to alter transcription is becoming more apparent, the challenge in the future is to identify the ERs and the pathways that are responsible for altering membrane properties and turning on gene transcription in hypothalamic neurons.
