## Abstract

MASOCHA W, ROTTENBERG ME, KRISTENSSON K. Migration of African trypanosomes across the blood–brain barrier. PHYSIOL. BEHAV. 00(0) 000-000, 2006. Subspecies of the extracellular parasite, *Trypanosoma brucei*, which are spread by the tsetse fly in sub-Saharan Africa, cause in humans Sleeping Sickness. In experimental rodent models the parasite can at a certain stage of disease pass through the blood–brain barrier across or between the endothelial cells and the vessel basement membranes. The laminin composition of the basement membranes determines whether they are permissive to parasite penetration. One cytokine, interferon-γ, plays an important role in regulating the trypanosome trafficking into the brain. Treatment strategies aim at developing drugs that can impede penetration of trypanosomes into the brain and/or that can eliminate trypanosomes once they are inside the brain parenchyma, but have lower toxicity than the ones presently in use.

## 1. Introduction

The brain is protected from attacks by microbes circulating in the blood by the so-called blood–brain barrier (BBB). At the same time the brain is considered an immune-privileged site that may provide a protected environment for microbe survival. We study mechanisms by which microbes reach the brain either by circumventing the BBB through spreading along peripheral nerves or by passing directly across the BBB. Mechanisms by which the replication of microbes can be controlled in the target areas in the brain and the consequences on neuronal functions as well as behavior of the host are other main topics for our research. For this purposes, we employ neurotropic viruses (e.g., influenza virus), bacteria (e.g., *Listeria monocytogenes*) and prions. We have also a long-standing interest in how one parasite, the African trypanosome, affects the function of the brain, since this parasite causes Sleeping Sickness, which is hallmarked by severe disturbances in the sleep pattern and circadian rhythm. The pathogenesis of these disturbances in brain function are now being disclosed, as recently reviewed [1]. In this overview we will focus on experiments which aim to disclose mechanisms by which trypanosomes can pass through the BBB into the brain parenchyma. Such information sets a basis for devising new drug treatment strategies to impede the penetration of parasites, or to eliminate them once they have penetrated into the brain.

## 2. Human African trypanosomiasis

*Trypanosoma brucei* (*Tb*) is an extracellular eukaryotic parasite that causes Sleeping Sickness or Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT), which is a fatal disease if untreated. The parasites are transmitted with the saliva of infected tsetse flies of the genus *Glossina* during a blood meal. The reservoirs of parasites causing human disease are wild game and domestic animals e.g., cattle and pigs. HAT is a re-emerging zoonosis with approximately 250 endemic foci in 36 African countries south of the Sahara. There are approximately 300,000 new cases of HAT each year and the disease is estimated to be a daily threat to about 60 million people [2]. The subspecies *Tb rhodesiense*, which is found in East and Southern Africa, causes an acute form of HAT resulting in death within a few weeks or months [2] whereas *Tb gambiense*, which is in West and Central Africa, causes a chronic form of the disease, lasting several months or years, hallmarked by disturbances in sleep pattern.

severe signs of central nervous system (CNS) involvement (reviewed in [3,4]). The latter stage of HAT is diagnosed by finding trypanosomes and/or an elevated number of white blood cells (WBC) in the cerebrospinal fluid. Patients in stage 1 are treated with relatively non-toxic drugs with poor penetration of the BBB (pentamidine or suramin) whereas drugs that permeate the BBB better (the arsenic compound melarsoprol, and difluoromethylornithine, DFMO), but which have a high degree of toxicity or are even lethal, are used for stage 2 patients [5]. Thus, investigating the mechanisms by which the parasites spread from the blood vessels into the CNS is of fundamental importance for understanding the neuropathogenesis of African trypanosomiasis and for developing new treatment strategies.

## 3. Trypanosomes and the blood brain barrier

Using both rat and mouse models of the chronic disease we studied when and how the rodent pathogenic *Tb brucei* strain crosses the BBB to invade the brain parenchyma. During the early stage of infection the parasites localize to the choroid plexus and other circumventricular organs [6] that lack a BBB. At a later stage, the parasites penetrate the blood vessels and enter the brain parenchyma (Fig. 1).

However, the tight junction proteins of the endothelial cells are preserved and there are no signs of plasma protein leakage into the brain parenchyma after trypanosome penetration [7]. This indicates that the spread of the trypanosome into the brain parenchyma is an active process rather than a passive diffusion secondary to a BBB breakdown. No parasite gradient around the ventricles is observed indicating that invasion of the brain parenchyma occurs by penetration of trypanosomes through the BBB, instead of by the spread of the parasites from the circumventricular organs or through the cerebrospinal fluid. [7,8].

The BBB is an integrated dynamic structure comprising endothelial cells and astrocytes, and their two basement membranes (Fig. 2 [9]): an endothelial basement membrane and a parenchymal basement membrane. The latter defines the border to the brain parenchyma [9]. Basement membranes are made up of a network of various molecules including laminin,

There are two stages of the disease recognized clinically: (1) the early stage, in which the parasites are confined to the hemolympathic system, and (2) the late encephalitic stage with

type IV collagen, perlecan and nidogen. The major structural and functional elements of all basement membranes are the laminins, which are heterotrimeric glycoproteins composed of α, β, and γ chains. There are five α, four β, and three γ chains that have been identified [10] and these combine to form up to 15 different laminin isoforms. The laminin α chains carry the domains that interact with cellular receptors and hence represent the functionally active portion of each laminin [11,12].

The CNS endothelial basement membranes have laminin α4 and α5 chains, whereas the laminin α1 and α2 chains are in the parenchymal basement membranes (Fig. 2. [9]). We found that *Tb brucei* penetrated the endothelial basement membrane containing laminin α4, but not laminin α5 (Fig. 3[8]).

In murine experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) inflammatory cells are recruited into the brain across blood vessels where only laminin α4, but not laminin α5, immunolabeling is observed in the endothelial basement membrane [9]. In our rodent models of African trypanosomiasis, lymphocytes are required for migration of the parasite into the brain, since it is inhibited in RAG-1 deficient mice, which lack B and T cells [8]. This suggests that trypanosomes utilize mechanisms similar to that of leukocytes to penetrate the BBB and invade the CNS or, more likely, that leukocytes could alter the structural integrity of the basement membranes paving way for subsequent penetration by the parasites.


### 4. IFN-γ and trypanosome penetration of the blood–brain barrier

The proinflammatory cytokine IFN-γ, secreted primarily by T- and natural killer cells, is a potent mediator of cell-mediated protective immunity against intracellular infections and activates different microbicidal effector mechanisms of macrophages and non-professional phagocytes [13]. IFN-γ also enhances the expression of endothelial cell adhesion molecules and chemokines, stimulates antigen presentation [13], regulates the expression of other cytokines or cytokine receptors [14–17] as well as that of laminin isoforms and their cell binding properties [18–20]. The production of IFN-γ is required for systemic host resistance to African trypanosomes in mice, with IFN-γ acting to induce macrophage trypanotoxic activities [21,22]. Paradoxically, mice deficient of IFN-γ or its receptor have reduced *Tb brucei* penetration of the brain parenchyma albeit increased parasitemia [8] compared to wild type mice. The absence of IL-12, which is a major inducer of IFN-γ, also results in a reduced parasite invasion of the brain parenchyma. The IFN-γ required for parasite invasion of the brain parenchyma is mainly derived from T cells since; contrary to wild type mice, brains of RAG deficient mice show no increased levels of IFN-γ transcripts, but a reduced invasion of the brain parenchyma. In the absence of IFN-γ the parasites still cross the endothelium and the permissive laminin α4-containing

Note that in C, laminin α5 occurs in association with vessels in the caudate nuclei but not vessels in the septal nuclei with accumulation of parasites around them. The perivascular space is noticeable during inflammation at the site where leukocytes and trypanosomes can cross the endothelium and its basement membrane. In the case of trypanosome infection the structural distinction between endothelial and parenchymal basement membranes is seen clearly in the absence of IFN-γ ([8], discussed in the text)], with permission.

endothelial basement membrane of the post-capillary venules, but not the parenchymal basement membrane. Hence they accumulate around the vessel between the two basement membranes [8]. These experiments therefore show that IFN-γ plays a vital role in parasite penetration of the parenchymal basement membrane. Although IFN-γ may have direct effects on the parasite [23,24], it probably facilitates *Tb brucei* migration into the brain parenchyma by acting on the tissues of the host rather than by altering the phenotype of the parasites, since a similar pattern of *Tb brucei* accumulation around vessels was observed in mice deficient of IFN-γ receptor.

The mechanisms by which IFN-γ facilitates *Tb brucei* transmigration across the parenchymal basement membrane into the brain parenchyma remains to be elucidated. Chemokine expression is critically regulated by IFN-γ allowing the recruitment of leukocytes to the brain in EAE and toxoplasma encephalitis [25,26]. Thus, IFN-γ might facilitate parasite migration across the parenchymal basement membrane through the induction of chemokines or enhancing leukocyte chemotaxis properties. In addition, IFN-γ may alter the cell binding properties of laminins or, more indirectly, induce molecules that are necessary for the breakdown of the parenchymal basement membrane such as matrix metalloproteases [9].

### 5. Relevance of murine model of African trypanosomiasis to chemotherapy

In our well defined mouse and rat models of the chronic African trypanosomiasis we are also investigating drugs that either may inhibit parasite invasion into the brain or eliminate parasites that have passed across the BBB. These two strategies can be used for preventing or treating the late stage of the disease.

Firstly, we investigated a drug that might impede trypanosome brain invasion. Minocycline has been reported to reduce leukocyte invasion of the CNS parenchyma in EAE [27,28]. Since trypanosomes share similarities with leukocytes in the penetration through the BBB [8], we studied the effect of minocycline on the brain parenchyma invasion by *Tb brucei* in infected C57BL/6 mice. Minocycline treatment impeded penetration of the parasite and leukocytes into the brain parenchyma and meliorated CNS inflammation as well [29]; this was accompanied by a prevention of weight loss and prolonged survival of infected mice. This indicates that strategies used to prevent leukocyte invasion of the CNS can also be successfully used for impeding trypanosome neuroinvasion.

Secondly, we have studied the effects of an adenosine analogue cordycepin (3′-deoxyadenosine) together with an adenosine deaminase (ADA) inhibitor (coformycin or deoxycortomycin) on *Tb brucei* infection after the parasites have penetrated the brain parenchyma. For cordycepin to be effective its inactivation through deamination by ADA has to be prevented [30,31]. Cordycepin has been shown to possess antiparasitic effects against *T congolence*, *T vivax*, *Tb rhodesiense* and *Tb brucei* [32–35]. Cordycepin and coformycin/deoxycortomycin eliminated parasites from the circulation and the brain parenchyma when administered to C57BL/6 mice after *Tb brucei*

penetration into the brain. All treated mice survived until the end of the experiment whereas all untreated infected mice died before 38 days p.i. This indicates that cordycepin can penetrate the BBB and kill trypanosomes in the brain parenchyma, since the BBB is not compromised and drugs which cannot cross the BBB are not able to cure the encephalic stage of African trypanosomiasis. The level of inflammatory cells in the brain is lower in trypanosome-infected mice treated with the cordycepin-ADA inhibitor combination as compared to untreated mice [36], thus, CNS inflammation was also resolved by curing the infection.

Development of new therapeutic compounds for the encephalic stage of HAT is urgent, since the only drug effective against both forms of HAT (the rhodesiense and the gambiense), melarsoprol, is highly toxic with a mortality rate of up to 5% [37] and resistance to it is increasing such that treatment failures have reached a perturbing 30% in some regions [38]. Besides being useful in studying the mechanisms which trypanosomes use to cross the BBB and invade the brain, our animal models are quite suitable for screening of compounds effective in the latter stage of HAT, as there is a clear read out (absence of trypanosomes from the brain parenchyma after treatment, when treatment commenced after the parasites had already invaded the parenchyma).

### 6. Concluding remarks

Animal models of chronic African trypanosomiasis are relevant for studying how trypanosomes cross the BBB and invade the brain parenchyma, the neuropathogenesis of African trypanosomiasis and also for evaluating or designing new treatment strategies for the late stage of African trypanosomiasis. *Tb brucei* migrate out of the cerebral blood vessels to invade the brain parenchyma leaving an intact BBB. Similar to lymphocyte invasion of the nervous system, the composition of the basement membranes of the intracerebral vessels play a decisive role in determining the sites of *Tb brucei* penetration into the brain. IFN-γ, while on one hand is involved in the immunological control of the infection, it facilitates, on the other hand, *Tb brucei* penetration through the parenchymal basement membrane of the BBB. The mechanisms behind this role of IFN-γ remain to be clarified. We have also shown that minocycline can impede trypanosome penetration into the brain and that the combination of cordycepin and coformycin/deoxycoformycin cures both stages of African trypanosomiasis. The development and testing of nucleoside analogues as promising therapeutic compounds for HAT warrants further research.
