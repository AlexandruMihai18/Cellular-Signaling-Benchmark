Several attempts to classify gastric cancer (GCA) have been made over the past decades. Most successful, and widely used, is the classification by Laurén, which distinguishes, by microscopical morphology alone, two main cancer pathogeneses, diffuse (DGCA) and intestinal (IGCA) subtypes, which appear clearly as dissimilar clinical and epidemiological entities. Here we review the main differences in epidemiology, histopathology, and molecular pathology of the two main subtypes of gastric carcinomas based on Laurén classification. In clinical practice, however, clinical staging, particularly in predicting the survival, still remains superior to all classifications of gastric cancer independent of cancer type. The existence of local precursor lesions or conditions of IGCA tumours, i.e. *Helicobacter pylori* gastritis, atrophic gastritis (AG), intestinal metaplasia (IM), adenoma, dysplasia, and intramucosal neoplasia, is firmly established. The links of DGCA with intestinal-type epithelium, AG or IM are poor, or do not exist. So far, *H. pylori* gastritis is the only universal precursor condition for DGCA. It implies that AG and achlorhydria are of minor significance and infrequent in the development of DGCA but are important steps in that of IGCA.

Despite an increasing body of data, the overall view on molecular pathology of GCA remains fragmentary. No consistent differences in the molecular pathology of GCA subtypes to meet the Laurén classification have been established. With the exception of TP53, no gene mutation occurring regularly in both histological types of GCA has been reported. Chromosomal aberrations and loss of heterozygosity seem to be non-specific and do not follow any consistent

route in the progression of GCA. Microsatellite instability is more commonly found in IGCA than in DGCA. The present epigenetic data suggest that most of the decrease (or loss) of gene expression may be explained by promoter hypermethylation which is more often found in IGCA. In DGCA specific genes such as CDH1 are more often hypermethylated. Compared with GCA, in premalignant condition lesions gene mutations and chromosomal aberrations are infrequent. Epigenetic dysregulation might also represent a major mechanism for altered gene expression in premalignant stages in gastric carcinogenesis.

Key words: gastric carcinoma; histopathology; classification; molecular pathology.

Correct classification of tumours to biologically rational entities is the basis for the proper understanding, clinical management, epidemiology and pathogenesis of the disease. In research and practice, the consideration of gastric carcinoma as only a single entity is wrong and may result in misleading conclusions. The epidemiology, biology and histopathology of gastric carcinomas show features that cannot be understood without subclassification of these tumours into at least two main subtypes: diffuse and intestinal.

Helicobacter pylori infection is the major trigger of events that finally lead to malignancy in some of the affected subjects. However, H. pylori alone is not enough to explain the malignancy. Carcinogenesis is to be considered a multistage process in which many external and internal cascades of events play a role, suggesting that gastric carcinoma is a multifactorial disease. In fact, the degree of colonization of the stomach mucosa with H. pylori is in inverse relationship with the cancer risk. This is exemplified by the fact that the cancer risk is highest in subjects with atrophic gastritis in which the numbers of bacteria are lowest, or the bacteria are totally absent or have disappeared. On the other hand, the cancer risk is low among duodenal ulcer (DU) patients in whom a very strong colonization of gastric mucosa with H. pylori is a typical feature. Some researchers even consider that this type of H. pylori gastritis in DU patients protects from gastric cancer.

However, the unambiguous role of H. pylori infection in gastric carcinogenesis implies that it is the aetiopathogenetic cascades triggered by the infection that are carcinogenic, not the H. pylori itself. These cascades result in various errors in the genome of dividing epithelial cells in the gastric epithelium and may lead to abnormal differentiation, growth and apoptosis of the affected cell lines, resulting in mucosal alterations that are seen as precancerous conditions and lesions on microscopy (atrophic gastritis, intestinal metaplasia, hyperplasia, dysplasia, etc), and finally as cancer.

In this review we describe the two main subtypes of gastric carcinomas (GCAs), and we try to explain what the main differences are which led us to consider gastric carcinoma as at least two biologically dissimilar entities, or as two dissimilar pathways of pathogenesis. We also discuss the main findings and differences in molecular events described so far to be typical of gastric cancer, and particularly of the two subtypes of GCA.

## HISTOPATHOLOGICAL SUBTYPES

Several classifications of gastric cancer have been proposed in the past decades: e.g. the classifications of the WHO, Ming, Mulligan, and Laurén, and the later one introduced by Goseki et al. Some proposed classifications are based merely on clinical and endoscopic appearances of the tumours, some on histopathology alone. The most

successful and currently widely used classification was presented by Laurén in 1965, as reviewed by Borchard and Songun et al. This classification has advantages in that it distinguishes, by microscopic morphology alone, two main cancer pathogeneses which appear as clearly dissimilar clinical and epidemiological entities. These are gastric adenocarcinomas of diffuse (DGCA) and intestinal (IGCA) subtypes. The differences between the subtypes are based on studies from the 1950s and 1960s by Järvi and co-workers showing that IGCA-type carcinomas associate with or develop from intestinal-type metaplastic epithelium not only in the stomach but also in the nose, gallbladder, urinary tract, and many other sites.

Over the decades, significant differences between IGCA and DGCA in clinical features, types of co-existing underlying mucosal conditions or lesions, and epidemiology have been described in many independent studies. These differences strongly support the view that the ‘Laurén classification’ is sensible and meaningfully differentiates gastric carcinomas into biologically different subtypes, a classification which can easily be done by ordinary pathologists from adequate samples of endoscopic biopsies.

However, in clinical practice, particularly as far as survival is concerned, all classifications of gastric cancer are of limited significance so far. The clinical stage of GCA, independent of cancer type, is the most important single and independent factor that determines survival. In this context, histopathological classification of cancers into DGCA or IGCA subtypes adds very little. In assessments of survival, more information may be obtained from the Goseki classification.

In clinical practice, cancers of DGCA subtype may be diagnosed at an earlier stage more often than those of the IGCA subtype, obviously due to the fact that the DGCAs appear more often as ulcer-like than the IGCA tumours, and are therefore frequently diagnosed at first as benign gastric ulcers. On the other hand, in screening programmes of gastric cancer with serological biomarkers, gastrocamera or endoscopy, early tumours of the IGCA subtype may be found more frequently than those of the DGCA subtype. Active screening programmes will find the local precursor lesions of IGCA tumours (adenoma, dysplasia, intramucosal neoplasia), or invasive cancers, at stages in which the growth of the neoplasia is limited to the mucosa and submucosa ('early gastric cancer').

The main types and morphological appearances of DGCA and IGCA are easily distinguishable on microscopy, even though variations in microscopic appearances within the subtypes occur, and even though unclassified (mixed) types also appear in 10–20% of the GCA cases in general. Examples of the subtypes are presented in Figures 1 and 2.

Based on many studies in the past, the morphogenesis of IGCA tumours is considered to be a gradual and stepwise dedifferentiation of intestinal epithelium to autonomously growing tumours that form glandular structures resembling those in adenocarcinomas of the gut in general. The characteristics of 'intestinalized epithelium' by immunohistochemistry, morphology and molecular biology can be recognized in IGCA tumours in varying extents, degrees and combinations. Well-differentiated IGCA tumours may contain well-matured goblet cells, express enzymes typical of mature small bowel epithelium, or express mucin profiles of the colon type; all these characteristics may, however, gradually disappear with dedifferentiation of tumours into more and more anaplastic forms of cancer. This morphogenesis of IGCA tumours makes understandable the observations that atrophic gastritis (AG) and intestinal metaplasia (IM) are common lesions that underlie and/or accompany IGCA.

The links between DGCA and intestinal-type epithelium, AG or IM are poor or non-existent. So far, *H. pylori* gastritis is the only universal precursor condition for DGCA.

Figure 1. Photograph of gastric carcinoma of (a) diffuse (DGCA) and (b) intestinal (IGCA) subtypes. The most typical microscopic feature of DGCA is the appearance of cancer as a mass of ‘mucocellular’ cells, of which some may resemble signet-ring cells, which grow in mucosa and gastric wall with poor or no glandular differentiation. The IGCA type is characterized by the formation of glands or branching tubular structures. The ability of the tumour to form glandular structures is the feature by which the cancers of IGCA subtype are graded as well, moderately or poorly differentiated. Such grading is not established for DGCA, but the grading in these tumours can be based on the grade of atypia of cancer cell nuclei, and on the differentiation of malignant cells to ‘mucocellular’ cells. (a) Periodic acid—Schiff (PAS) stain, $400 \times$; (b) van Gieson (VG) stain, $400 \times$.

These tumours appear on microscopy to lack clear-cut glandular differentiation, and they grow as groups or rows of single ‘mucocellular’ cells, some of which may be of signet-ring-cell type in the best-differentiated tumours. In spite of the absence of morphogenetic links to IM, mucin profiles in the ‘mucocellular’ cancer cells in DGCA may sometimes be like those of the colon, i.e., expressing strongly acidic sulphated mucins. Commonly, the ‘mucocellular cells’ in DGCA resemble epithelial cells of normal gastric foveolar epithelium on microscopy and immunohistochemistry. To a varying extent, expressions of neuroendocrine-like features — for example those of ECL-like cells — may occur in DGCA tumour cells and, to a lesser extent, in IGCA tumours.

Classification of GCA into DGCA and IGCA types is roughly comparable with other commonly used classifications of GCA. Similarities between the Laurén classification and the WHO classification are presented in Figure 3. Differentiated forms of GCA in Japanese classifications roughly correspond to IGCA in the Laurén classification, and DGCA tumours in the Laurén classification largely correspond to the poorly differentiated GCA forms in Japan. In gross morphology, the IGCA tumours tend to be exophytic, demarcated masses on endoscopy, and the DGCA tumours are merely ulcerating and expanding lesions that sometimes appear only as a stiff, immobile gastric wall with an intact-looking overlaying mucous membrane. Rarely, but noteworthy, intramucosal DGCA-looking tumours — even with a signet-ring-cell appearance — are metastases of lobular breast cancers in women. In these cases, cancer cells are positive

**Figure 2.** Photograph of gastric carcinoma of (a) diffuse (DGCA) and (b) intestinal (IGCA) subtypes. Well-differentiated early forms of DGCA tumours often appear with irregular distribution and growth of ‘mucosal’ cancer cells, resembling cells of normal gastric foveolar epithelium, in the upper part of the gastric lamina. In IGCA, early forms commonly express properties of intestinal metaplasia and gut epithelium. The photograph (b) shows an early form of IGCA in which differentiation to mature gut epithelium and intestinal metaplasia (IM) is evident. In Laurén’s classification of GCA, the abbreviation ‘intestinal’ was derived from links between the IGCA tumours and intestinal metaplasia (IM) and with intestinal epithelium in the small bowel but particularly in the colon. The word ‘diffuse’ was derived from patterns of growth of the DGCA tumours, and by the absence of links to IM. (a) Periodic acid—Schiff (PAS) stain, 400×; (b) van Gieson (VG) stain, 400×.

## ROLE OF H. PYLORI GASTRITIS, ATROPHIC GASTRITIS AND ACHLORHYDRIA: A MULTISTAGE PROCESS

AG is the most important and the greatest single risk factor for GCA. Severe atrophic gastritis in both antrum and corpus (severe multifocal AG) raises the risk of GCA 45–90-fold compared to cancer risk in subjects with a normal healthy stomach, or in subjects with non-atrophic *H. pylori* gastritis.¹³ The cancer risk increases exponentially with increasing grade and extent of AG, but is already slightly increased (twofold) in patients with non-atrophic *H. pylori* gastritis compared to the cancer risk in subjects with a healthy stomach. Based on cross-sectional case-control studies in Finland, estimates of the GCA risk in different phenotypes and grades of gastritis and AG are presented in Figure 4.

The multistep morphogenesis from *H. pylori* infection to GCA — the so-called ‘Correa sequence’ — includes consecutive stages in which non-atrophic gastritis, AG, IM and focal dysplastic lesions precede or co-exist with the appearance of overt cancer.¹⁴ The pathway through or along with AG and IM is the sequence of the GCAs of the IGCA subtype but is not the prevailing sequence in the morphogenesis of DGCA. Instead, non-atrophic *H. pylori* gastritis is the most common underlying or co-existing gastric condition in patients with DGCA. Up to half of all GCAs appear in stomachs where the co-existing gastritis is non-atrophic, or where marked atrophic and metaplastic lesions are absent or are mild and limited to a few areas at most. Among patients with overt GCA, serum levels of pepsinogen I (PGI) — or the pepsinogen I/II ratio — are low (below cut-off indicating moderate or severe atrophic gastritis in the corpus) in one-third of all GCA patients in general. Correspondingly, one-third of GCA patients show serum levels of PGI suggestive of normal or even hypertrophic corpus mucosa. The distribution of serum levels of PGI in a random sample of GCA patients from a population-based investigation on 22,000 elderly male smokers in Finland is presented in Figure 5.

Corpus mucosa

|  | Normal | Nonatrophic gastritis | Atrophic gastritis |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  | mild | moderate | severe |
| Normal | 1 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 5 |
| Nonatrophic gastritis | 1 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 5 |
| Atrophic gastritis - mild | 2 | 2 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
| - moderate | 2 | 2 | 4 | 5 | 10 |
| - severe | 18 | 18 | 36 | 36 | 90 |

Figure 4. Estimations of relative risk (odds) of gastric carcinoma (GCA) in different topographic phenotypes and grades of gastritis (atrophic gastritis). The risk of GCA is suggested to be 1 in subjects with normal healthy gastric mucosa (reference category: left upper corner). The estimations are based on cross-sectional study of samples of gastric cancer patients and controls in Finland in the 1980s. Note that the cancer risk rises exponentially with an increase in grade and extent of atrophic gastritis. In practice, subjects with normal healthy gastric mucosa do not have any risk of GCA if the rare cancers with inherited gene errors are excluded.

The above-mentioned manifold dissimilarities in biology and epidemiology between DGCA and IGCA tumours suggest that their basic pathogenesis, as well as molecular biology (see below), are dissimilar, and that all GCA cases do not develop through the 'AG-IM-dysplasia sequence'. A suggestion for a more comprehensive scheme on hypothetical pathways in GCA morphogenesis is presented in Figure 6. It implies that AG and achlorhydria are of minor significance and are infrequent in the development of

PGI is an excellent biomarker of atrophic corpus gastritis. It can be assayed from serum/plasma, and its levels decrease with increasing grade of atrophic gastritis. Serum/plasma levels <50 μg/L indicate atrophic gastritis with high accuracy, and those <25 μg/L indicate advanced (moderate or severe) atrophy. Note that up to 30% of GCA patients have low PGI, suggesting that atrophic corpus gastritis is the precursor condition in up to 50% of GCA cases.

Figure 6. Proposed sequences and steps in the pathogenesis of gastric cancer (GCA) of both diffuse (DGCA) and intestinal (IGCA) subtypes. Note that H. pylori is the initial cause of both DGCA and IGCA, even though the pathogenic steps in gastric carcinogenesis are markedly dissimilar between the subtypes after the acquisition of H. pylori. Major genetic and molecular alterations are also shown, as described under molecular pathology in the text.

DGCA but are important steps in that of IGCA. AG and achlorhydria favour colonization of the stomach by bacteria and fungi that may produce carcinogens, suggesting that the carcinogenic exposure in IGCA may be dissimilar to that in DGCA. In the achlorhydric stomach and AG, high salt intake may increase the carcinogenic potency of the colonizing microorganisms.¹⁴

Approximately 20–30% of all gastric cancers in Western countries appear to present in stomachs in which the gastric mucosa looks normal and healthy in gastric biopsies. It is conceivable that some inherited critical genetic errors are the cause of these cancers. These cancers often appear at a young age, tend to accumulate in the same families, and often occur in the gastric corpus. However, DGCA tumours in general also tend to appear at younger age than the IGCA tumours, and the DGCA show some predominance in the corpus and fundus, in contrast to IGCA that may prevail in antral and angular areas. Moreover, the DGCA tumours occur equally frequently in both genders and increase in incidence and age-specific prevalence more smoothly by age than the IGCA tumours.

GCA is approximately twice as common in males as females all over the world.¹⁵ This male predominance is, however, limited to IGCA tumours and is not a feature of DGCA tumours. If the epidemiology of GCA is examined as a ratio of age-specific incidence in males to females, a surprising similarity will be observed worldwide in GCA epidemiology. This male-to-female ratio of the GCA incidence (M/F ratio) is similar (around 2) all over the world, including countries with low and high incidences of cancer. Furthermore, this ratio has remained stable and unchanged over the decades, even though the overall GCA incidence has markedly decreased in Western societies (e.g. more than 70% in Finland during the past 50 years). In addition, with respect to age, the M/F ratio is not constant but forms a bell-shaped curve in which the top is at

age around 60 years: i.e., the M/F ratio of GCA (IGCA) incidence first increases with increasing age, reaches the top at age 60, and then decreases. This phenomenon is the same or similar in all populations and countries from which reliable registry statistics on GCA incidence are available.

The above observations indicate some important general facts regarding the biology and pathogenesis of GCA. First, the biology and pathogenesis of GCA must be markedly similar everywhere in the world, including both high- and low-incidence countries, indicating that the major biological background factors of GCA are same throughout the world. The worldwide distribution and ubiquity of *H. pylori* fulfils this criterion as a major universal and common factor in GCA pathogenesis. Second, the proportional occurrence of DGCA and IGCA tumours is similar in all populations, and the decrease in IGCA and DGCA incidence rates has been proportionally similar, i.e., both GCA types have decreased in incidence rate proportionally similarly along with the overall decrease of GCA incidence, and along with the overall decrease in *H. pylori* acquisition rate. Otherwise, the stability of the M/F ratio of cancer incidence worldwide cannot be explained or understood. In addition, the conclusions imply that both DGCA and IGCA are *H. pylori*-related diseases even though their pathogeneses after the acquisition may be markedly dissimilar. It is noteworthy that the relationship between *H. pylori* infection and IGCA (or DGCA) is exponential: a decrease in age-specific prevalence of *H. pylori* in the general population is associated with an exponential decrease in GCA incidence (Figure 7).

The non-linear relationship between M/F ratio of GCA incidence and age suggests that the wording of ‘twofold commonness of GCA in males compared to females’ is partly incorrect. The above-mentioned observations on M/F ratio of GCA incidence around 2 are based on the fact that the IGCA tumours appear around 15 years later

![Diagram](attachment:diagram.png)

**Figure 7.** The diagram presents the incidences of gastric cancer (GCA) and the prevalence of *H. pylori* gastritis among Finnish males at age 50 years in different birth cohorts. The cancer incidence data are from the Finnish Cancer Registry, and the prevalences of gastritis were estimated by assuming that the infection rate of *H. pylori* is specific for each birth cohort and that the acquisitions occur in childhood. In this context, birth-group-specific prevalence of *H. pylori* gastritis in the past, at present and in the future can be estimated from the age-specific prevalence of *H. pylori* gastritis in the present population. Note that the relationship between GCA and *H. pylori* gastritis is exponential. It means that a decrease in prevalence of *H. pylori* infection is reflected as an exponential decrease in GCA incidence.

in females than in males, i.e., IGCA tumours are infrequent in females until menopause (oestrogen probably protects women against IGCA) and their incidence begins to increase exponentially after the menopause. Due to the limited lifetime of human beings, the development of IGCA tumours out of time between the genders gives a false impression of a predominance of GCA in males as compared with females.

# DIFFERENCES IN MOLECULAR PATHOLOGY BETWEEN IGCA AND DGCA

Studies on the molecular pathology of GCA have largely been focused on IGCA and DGCA, as reviewed by Ming, Werner et al., Fiocca et al., Tahara, Gologan et al., and Zheng et al. The remaining GCAs, representing mainly the unclassified (mixed) type, share molecular and genetic alterations found in IGCA and DGCA. Unlike in the adenoma–colorectal cancer sequence, no clear linear accumulation of genetic defects in the course of gastric carcinogenesis has been found, even though a multistage progression of mucosal lesions from chronic active gastritis to adenoma/dysplasia and cancer has been described for IGCA. For DGCA no premalignant lesion is known. Several regulatory and molecular hot spots — including regulation of the cell cycle, DNA repair, cell adhesion, angiogenesis, apoptosis and matrix remodelling — have been extensively studied in GCA. The molecular genetic changes include mainly the activation of oncogenes and inactivation of tumour-suppressor genes by genetic and epigenetic mechanisms. As discussed above, histological and clinical heterogeneity has hampered the exact classification of GCA and further delineation of the underlying defects in the molecular pathways of the individual tumours. In general, significant heterogeneity in expression of molecular markers exists even between GCAs having apparently identical histopathological morphology. This is also true for histologically healthy-looking mucosae or mucosal lesions with similar morphology which may differ in terms of molecular pathology. In the following we will briefly describe some of the reported major gene alterations in DGCA and along the multistage progression to IGCA, as outlined and summarized in Figure 6.

## Germ-line mutations

Familial GCAs, which represent 1–3% of gastric cancers, include intestinal, mixed, and diffuse subtypes. The hereditary diffuse form occurs mostly in adults under 40 years of age as a dominantly inherited trait. Inactivation — usually by a truncating germ-line mutation of the gene coding the cell–cell adhesion protein E-cadherin (CDH1) — is found in about a third of cases with the diffuse and rarely with the mixed type of familial GCA. Rare germ-line missense mutations in TP53 and the C-MET receptor tyrosine kinase gene have also been found as predisposing factors for hereditary DGCA. However, a comprehensive picture of the germ-line mutations predisposing to familial GCA still remains elusive.

## Gene expression

Genome-wide gene expression studies have provided an overall view on differences between IGCA and DGCA at the gene level. In IGCA Hasegawa et al reported the up-regulation of genes involved in signal transduction, blood coagulation (e.g. PROCR, SERPINGI, and HRG), and gene transcription (e.g. NFIL3, LHXI, and HOXB7), while

down-regulation of genes contributing to energy metabolism, epithelial cell barrier function (e.g. the trefoil factors TFF1 and TFF2) and absorption was seen. Boussioutas et al.³⁰ found distinct expression profiles between IGCA and DGCA. The up-regulated genes in IGCA were mediators of cell proliferation, including genes active in cell-cycle control, DNA replication, and arrangement of chromosomes, while genes associated with epithelial differentiation were down-regulated.³⁰ Hippo et al.³¹ observed in IGCA over-expression of intestinal enzymes (e.g. CALC, GUCY2C, and CPX2) and the cell–cell adhesion molecule LI-cadherin, while in the study by Lee et al.³² enhancement of apoptosis-related gene α-II spectrin, Na/K-ATPase β-subunit and KIAA0111 was found in IGCA. In contrast, in DGCA gene expression changes were found in genes of extracellular matrix components (such as collagens, proteoglycan or matrix metalloproteinases), smooth muscle and cell adhesion molecules, suggesting altered interaction between epithelial cells and their extracellular stroma.³⁰ Particularly in DGCA, down-regulation of cell–cell adhesion molecules E-cadherin, occludin and actin-related protein was seen.³⁰ In line with results from gene expression studies, immunohistochemistry has shown (primarily in DGCA) impaired expression of genes such as laminin, type IV collagen, integrins and cadherins.³³ The abnormal expression of splice variants has also been linked to cancers. In GCA, variants of the cell adhesion molecule CD44 have been found, with a possible association with tumour cell invasion and metastasis. The pattern of CD44 exon usage is different in IGCA and DGCA, where splice variants have been found in 66.7% and 90.9% of the tumour samples, respectively.¹⁹

# Gene mutations

Gene mutations — i.e. base substitutions, insertions or deletions of a small number of base pairs — may lead to activation of oncogenes (e.g. K-RAS) or to inactivation of tumour-suppressor genes (e.g. TP53 and APC). In general, in GCA the number of genes in which mutations have been regularly found is low. TP53 is inactivated largely by missense point mutations in about half of the advanced GCAs, with a higher incidence in IGCA than in DGCA, especially in early-stage tumours.¹⁸,³⁴,³⁵ The strong immunoreactivity of TP53 found in 17–91% of GCAs may result from over-expression or from prolonged half-life of the protein. However, the increase in TP53 staining is not always due to a mutated gene, since the over-expression and inhibition of TP53 mRNA degradation is a normal response to slow down the cell cycle.³⁵ Point mutations in K-RAS have been found in 8–19% of GCAs³⁶–³⁹ and occur mainly in the intestinal type, as reviewed by Werner et al.¹⁷ and Fiocca et al.¹⁸ There is a subset of mutations linked to silencing of the DNA repair gene O⁶-methylguanyl methyltransferase (MGMT), which has been shown to lead to increased frequency of novel point mutations in K-RAS in both IGCA and DGCA.⁴⁰,⁴¹ Mutations in the adenomatous polyposis (APC) gene have been found in 3–44% of GCAs, occurring predominantly in IGCA.⁴²–⁴⁵ CDH1 is found mutated in 28–56% of advanced DGCAs, while significant mutations were absent in IGCA.⁴⁶–⁴⁸ Mutations of TFF1 have been observed in 0–16.3% of GCAs,⁴⁹,⁵⁰ and mutations of the β-catenin gene has been found exclusively in IGCA (26.9%).⁵¹ In conclusion, with the exception of TP53, no gene mutation occurring regularly in both histological types of GCA has been detected to date.

# Changes in DNA copy number

Changes in the copy number of DNA (high-level amplifications, gains and losses) are common in gastric cancers. The increase in the copy number of an oncogenic

sequence may lead to its activation, whereas homo- or hemizygotic losses at a tumour-suppressor sequence may lead to impairment of its function. The changes in copy number, seen as DNA content differences between tumour and normal tissue, may be assessed using comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) either on whole chromosomes<sup>52</sup> or on DNA microarrays.<sup>53</sup> The GCA-related oncogenes which are known to be up-regulated by DNA amplification include e.g. ERBB2, K-SAM and C-MET (on chromosomal regions 17q12, 10q26, and 7q31, respectively), and the tumour-suppressor genes most frequently down-regulated by copy number losses include e.g. p16INK, APC, TP53, and deleted in colon cancer (DCC) (on 9p21, 5q21, 17p13 and 18q21, respectively), as reviewed by Tahara.<sup>19</sup> The gains and losses of the genomic regions are therefore thought to indicate the involvement of the corresponding genes in the carcinogenic process. ERBB2 is reported to be amplified specifically in IGCA (33% of tumours),<sup>54,55</sup> whereas K-SAM and C-MET amplification is reported to be more specific for DGCA (30–52% of tumours).<sup>56–58</sup> Gastric cancers have been reported to show multiple additional genomic aberrations. Gains on 8q, 17q12-21 and 20q and losses on 4q and 18q have been observed mostly in IGCA.<sup>59</sup> A high-level amplification of the 17q12-21 region containing ERBB2 was found only in IGCA.<sup>59</sup> Wu et al<sup>60</sup> observed — predominantly in IGCA — gains on 8q and 17q, and losses on 3p and 5q, whereas gains on 13q were more common in DGCA. In the study by Koo et al<sup>61</sup> gains on 18q and 20q were observed in IGCA, and on 8q, 13q and 17q in DGCA. Peng et al<sup>62</sup> found in DGCA gains at 8q, 3q 7q and 8p, and loss at 7p. Conversely, van Grieken et al<sup>63</sup> and Noguchi et al<sup>64</sup> did not find any significant differences in copy number changes between the two GCA types. The majority (64%) of the DGCA tumours analysed by Nessling et al<sup>65</sup> were found to be chromosomally stable. In conclusion, chromosomal aberrations seem to be non-specific and do not follow any consistent route in the progression of GCA, as discussed by Choi et al<sup>66</sup> and reviewed by Tahara.<sup>19</sup>

# Microsatellite alterations

The analysis of tandemly repeated stretches of DNA (microsatellites) is used to reveal microsatellite instability (MSI) and loss of heterozygosity (LOH). MSI is characterized by novel microsatellite alleles, and it can be delineated as high-level MSI (MSI-H) or low-level MSI (MSI-L) or to microsatellite-stable (MSS) type according to the frequency of mutations. MSI is found in 15–50% of GCAs, affecting both IGCA (23–64%) and DGCA (9–24%).<sup>67–72</sup> In most studies MSI-H has been reported to occur more often in IGCA (23–25%) than in DGCA (4–8%).<sup>66,71–73</sup> The MSI-L phenotype has been found to associate with IGCA and the LOH phenotype.<sup>71,72</sup> However, a significant fraction (43–92%) of primary GCAs represents an apparently microsatellite-stable (i.e. replication-error-negative) phenotype which is found more often in DGCA than in IGCA.<sup>69,71,72</sup> In primary gastric cancers MSI-H is due to deficient repair of replication errors of DNA and is caused mainly by the silencing of hMLH1 (up to 90%) by promoter hypermethylation.<sup>74–76</sup> Also, in a significant fraction (50–75%) of MSI-L tumours hypermethylated hMLH1 gene promoter has been found.<sup>75,76</sup> In MSI-H gastric cancers several genes undergo alterations in the repetitive segments of the coding regions leading to reading frame mutations, e.g. the following frequencies have been observed: transforming growth factor β receptor II gene (TGFβRII) (63–92%), insulin-like growth factor II receptor gene (IGFIIIR) (5–25%), proapoptotic BAX gene (15–68%), DNA repair genes hMSH6 (22%) and hMSH3 (37–38%), and transcription factor

gene E2F-4 (37–61%).<sup>77–80</sup> The high frequency of *TGFβRII* and *E2F-4* mutations in MSI-H adenomas has been suggested to indicate their early causative role in gastric tumorigenesis.<sup>78,79</sup> In MSI-L tumours target gene mutations are infrequent.<sup>76,78,79</sup> Recently a so-called instabilotyping analysis of MSI-H gastric cancers has revealed in over 20% of the tumours additional genes with frame-shift mutations, including *SEC63*, *DKZp564KII2* (multi-sex-combs *Drosophila* homologue) and *ACTRII* (activin-type 2 receptor gene).<sup>81</sup>

A frequent occurrence of LOH in a tumour has been suggested to indicate chromosomal instability (CIN).<sup>66,82</sup> LOH is observed as loss of the other parental microsatellite allele, but it does not necessarily indicate loss of DNA.<sup>83</sup> The appearance of LOH has been suggested to indicate a second inactivating hit of a tumour-suppressor gene, characterizing the so-called suppressor pathway of carcinogenesis.<sup>82,84</sup> In GCA, LOH is mostly found on chromosomes 2q, 4p, 5q, 6p, 7q, 11q, 14q, 17p, 18q and 21q,<sup>85,86</sup> and depending on the number of loci analysed it can be detected in up to 80% of tumours with an increasing frequency in the progression from early to advanced GCA.<sup>66</sup> However, no consistent differences in LOH frequencies between IGCA and DGCA have been found when analysed with a limited number of loci.<sup>66,85–87</sup> For *TP53* an LOH rate of 26–83% has been reported primarily in IGCA, which equals its mutation rate.<sup>35</sup> In the study by McKie et al.,<sup>88</sup> LOH at *APC* was found in 43% and 22%, and LOH at the mutated in colon cancer (*MCC*) gene in 60% and 20% of DGCA and IGCA, respectively. Inactivation of *TFFI* by LOH has been observed in 13–28% of GCAs, including both histological types.<sup>49,50</sup> The inactivation of *CDH1* by LOH was consistently found by Ascaño et al.<sup>48</sup> in only 4.1% of DGCAs and in 7.6% of IGCA; this is in agreement with the results of Tamura et al.<sup>89</sup> suggesting that *CDH1* inactivation by LOH is not common in gastric carcinogenesis. Fang et al.<sup>71</sup> showed LOH of *APC*, *MCC* and *DCC* alleles in 28%, 31%, and 37% of GCAs, respectively. In early-onset GCAs losses at loci near *CDH1* (17.2%), *RUNX3* (17.4–26.1%), and *TP53* (15.4–23.1%) have been found by Carvalho et al.<sup>90</sup> *TP53* aberrations were associated with IGCA, while *CDH1* abnormalities were not associated with any histological type.<sup>90</sup> In conclusion, as differentiated by microsatellite assessment, IGCA seems to comprise more replication-error-related mutations than DGCA, while no clear-cut differences in the rate of LOH for a single gene have been observed between the two GCA subtypes.

As described above, on the basis of the type and frequency of microsatellite alterations, GCAs can be delineated into mutator (MSI-H) and suppressor (LOH) phenotypes (reviewed by Tahara<sup>19</sup>), which are considered to occur as mutually exclusive.<sup>82</sup> Accordingly, MSI-H cancers infrequently show mutations of genes such as *TP53*,<sup>18</sup> or LOH of *APC*, *DCC*, and *MCC*, or aneuploidy.<sup>71</sup> IGCA includes more mutator phenotypes (approximately 20%) than DGCA (about 5%). Recently, a cytosine island methylator phenotype (CIMP) has been described in GCA,<sup>91</sup> and high-level CIMP has been found to be associated with the mutator phenotype of GCA.<sup>92–94</sup> However, in the study by An et al.,<sup>94</sup> CIMP or MSI status did not associate with the tumour histology. A CIMP-negative phenotype has been found in 13–38% of GCAs,<sup>91,94</sup> of which 64% were also of the MSS phenotype.<sup>94</sup>

## Epigenetic alterations

In addition to gene mutations, epigenetic alterations leading to deficient regulation of gene expression may contribute to malignant transformation.<sup>95</sup> The methylation

pattern of DNA is thought to be altered during carcinogenesis, which results in silencing of tumour-suppressor genes by hypermethylation of the promoter CpG islands. 96,97 The reasons for aberrant methylation are currently unknown. In some cases promoter hypermethylation leads to activation of the gene, as shown for human telomerase reverse transcriptase gene (hTERT), 98 the activity of which is increased in GCAs as reviewed by Tahara. 19 In conjunction with CpG island hypermethylation, a global hypomethylation of 5-methylcytosine in coding regions and introns representing 30–40% of the cancer cell genome takes place in cancers. Under-methylation predisposes the genome to loss of imprinting (LOI), i.e. demethylation of a parental allele, to chromosomal instability (CIN) and aneuploidy. 96 LOI and the subsequent over-expression of the insulin-like growth factor II gene (IGF2) have been found more often in DGCA (53.3%) than in IGCA (14.3%). 99 Promoter demethylation has been shown to lead to over-expression e.g. of the tumour-suppressor genes maspin 100 and cyclin D2 101 involved in gastric carcinogenesis. Epigenetic gene silencing also includes methylation-associated histone deacetylation, as shown for e.g. the helicase-like transcription factor gene (HLTF), which is inactivated in about 50% of IGCA and DGCA. 102 As compared to healthy gastric mucosa, the expression of acetylated histone H4 was decreased in 45% of adenomas and in 70% of tumours, irrespective of the histological type, indicating that histone deacetylation is a global epigenetic change in gastric cancer. 103

Increasing numbers of genes have been described as being silenced by hypermethylation in various molecular pathways involved in control of the cell cycle, DNA repair, cell–cell adhesion, apoptosis, and angiogenesis, as reviewed by Esteller and Herman 96 and Esteller. 104 In general, GCA shows a rate of concurrent gene hypermethylation significantly higher than that in the mucosa of individuals with a healthy stomach. Different cancers may show both shared and cancer-specific patterns of gene methylation. 106 Using a set of 12 genes, Esteller et al 106 found promoter methylation in 36% of p16, 26% of p14, 16% of MGMT, 34% of APC, and in 32% of hMLH1 in primary GCA. The rate of APC methylation equals the reported rate of LOH (22–43%) for APC 88 and the rate of APC mutation (3–44%). 42–45 The CDH1 gene is more often methylated in DGCA (56–83%) than in IGCA (28–44%). 47,107–109 In the study by Machado et al, 47 56.3% of DGCAs had a mutated CDH1 gene, and of these tumours 66.7% had also methylated CDH1, suggesting that promoter hypermethylation may be the second inactivating hit in more than half of DGCAs harbouring CDH1 mutation. CDH1 hypermethylation occurs at similar rates in early (60%) and advanced (49%) carcinomas, suggesting that it is an early event in gastric carcinogenesis. 107 Silencing of the DNA repair gene MGMT by hypermethylation leads to increased K-RAS point mutations, forming a link between epigenetic dysregulation and mutational events. 40 In the study by Oue et al, 110 no association was found between the hypermethylation of MGMT and TP53 mutations in GCA. No clear-cut difference in epigenetics between IGCA and DGCA has been found, but concordant gene hypermethylation is more often found in IGCA, while in DGCA specific genes — such as CDH1 and retinoic acid receptor RAR-β, 92 p14(ARF) gene, 111 lysyl oxidase (LOX), HRASLS, 112 and DAP-K 113 — are more often affected. Some genes (MGMT, GSTP1 and hMLH1) unassociated with tumour histology may show gender-specific methylation, with females having higher predisposition to aberrant gene methylation. 105

In conclusion, the present epigenetic data suggest that much, if not most, of the decrease (or loss) of gene expression may be explained by promoter hypermethylation. Some of the major differences in molecular pathology between IGCA and DGCA are summarized in Figure 6.

# MOLECULAR PATHOLOGY OF PRECANCEROUS CONDITIONS

## Gene expression

The molecular basis of IM has recently been unravelled by detection of expression of the caudal-related and gut-specific transcription factors CDX-1 and CDX-2 upon intestinalization of the stomach.¹¹⁴–¹¹⁶ CDX-1 and CDX-2 control proliferation and differentiation of epithelial cells,¹¹⁷ and together with the synchronously expressed intestinal mucin, MUC2, serve as immunohistochemical markers for IM.¹¹⁸–¹²⁰ CDX-2 is present in gastric adenomas, whereas aberrant expression is seen both in DGCA (61.5%) and in IGCA (97%), with a higher association with the latter.¹¹⁸,¹²¹ In general, diminished expression of CDX-2 parallels the dedifferentiation of GCA.¹¹⁹ Several proteins have been observed to be over-expressed in premalignant conditions: e.g. cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) in *H. pylori* gastritis and in IM,¹²² TP53,³⁵ transforming growth factor α (TGFα) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in IM,¹²³ and cyclins E and D2 in dysplasia.¹⁰¹,¹²⁴ Over-expression of C-MET is detectable in about 50% of IM, adenoma, and dysplasia.¹²⁴ The decreased expression of stomach-specific genes — such as the transcription factors SOX2,¹²⁵ RUNX3,¹²⁶ and the stomach-specific mucin MUC5AC¹²⁴ — takes place upon intestinalization.

Genome-wide gene expression studies using microarrays have revealed major changes in the expression of genes involved along the stepwise progression of mucosal lesions. For instance, mitochondrial genes were observed to be up-regulated in chronic gastritis linked to *H. pylori*, whereas in IM up-regulation of the intestinal genes (e.g. CDX-1, MYO1A, Villin 1, and TFF1) was observed.³⁰ Also in the study by Hippo et al.,²⁵ up-regulation of genes related to gastrointestinal-specific function and immune response was found in the non-cancerous tissues in stomachs with cancer. *hTERT* expression has already been found in chronic gastritis (23%),¹²⁷ in IM (47–79%),¹²⁷,¹²⁸ and in adenoma (38%).¹²⁹ Also, the expression of CD44 variants has already been found in 30% of IM.¹⁹

## Mutations

As compared with GCA, the number of genes mutated in premalignant lesions is low.¹⁹ The frequencies of mutations in TP53 (0–67%), APC (6–40%), and K-RAS (10–18%) in the chronic gastritis—IM—adenoma sequence have been reported, as reviewed by Fenoglio-Preiser et al.,³⁵ Tahara,¹⁹ and Gologan et al.²⁰ Only about 20% of GCAs have been suggested to arise from adenomas, the rest arising from flat adenomas or lesions.¹⁶ Interestingly, mutations in APC have been found in 20–76% of adenomas or flat dysplasias, but in only 1–4% of adenocarcinomas, suggesting that APC mutation in precancerous lesions is not critical for gastric carcinogenesis.⁴⁴,¹³⁰ Mutations in K-RAS have been found in 0–16% of adenomas, with no difference in prevalence between adenoma with or without association with cancer.¹³⁰,¹³¹ Also, a low incidence (5.5%) of TFF1 mutations in adenoma was reported by Park et al.⁴⁹

## DNA copy number changes

In adenoma and dysplasia the results from CGH studies show a wide range of infrequent genetic alterations before their multiplication in GCA.¹³²,¹³³ Adenomas have been reported to show gain of chromosomes 7, 8 and 20q and loss of 5q and

9q21.3, while hyperplastic polyps show loss of 9q21.3, 15q11-14, 1p21-31 and 21q11-21.2. [32,133] However, in gastric adenoma—carcinoma pairs, as analysed by CGH, common clonal genetic alterations were frequently already detectable (93%) in the adenoma stage as compared with GCA. [134]

## Microsatellite alterations

MSI has been found in chronic gastritis, independent of *H. pylori* infection, in stomachs where MSI-positive adenoma or adenocarcinoma has later developed, [135] which suggests that MSI is an early event in gastric carcinogenesis. Mismatch-repair-related mutations accumulate with the progression of mucosal lesions. MSI is a common finding in IM, occurring in up to 40% of lesions in stomach both with and without cancer. [16,66,71,131,136,137] Also in adenomas, an incidence of 40% for MSI and about 20% for MSI-H has been reported, which equals the rate found in IGCA. [16,135,138] In adenomas, MSI positivity has been found to associate more strongly with adenocarcinoma than MSI negativity. [79] Most of the decreased *hMLH1* expression (87%) in MSI-H adenomas is due to promoter hypermethylation of the gene. [138] Lee et al [139] found the normal and gastric mucosa negative for CIMP-H, which was detectable in 15% of IM and in 50% of adenomas, adenocarcinoma-associated adenomas, dysplasias, or adenocarcinomas.

The occurrence of LOH in gastritis and IM has been extensively reviewed by Tahara [19] and Gologan et al. [20] The higher rate of LOH events on particular chromosomal arms in GCA (up to 45%) as compared with that in adenomas (<10%) suggests that a specific adenoma—carcinoma sequence is not a major pathway in gastric carcinogenesis. [85] The mutation and/or LOH of *APC* is linked to adenoma formation and dysplasia, but probably its role is limited in progression to GCA. [44,130] Inactivation of *TP53* by LOH has been observed in 0–14% of IM and in 0–22% of adenomas. [35] Park et al [49] found LOH or mutation of *TFF1* in only 5.5% and 3.3% of adenomas, respectively. However, LOH of *APC*, *DCC* or *TP53* has been shown in 38% of healthy stomachs as an ageing-related phenomenon in subjects over 60 years of age. [140]

## Epigenetic alterations

Epigenetic alterations of tumour-related genes have been observed in non-neoplastic cells as an age-related phenomenon. Waki et al [108,113,141] assessed the methylation status of several genes (*APC*, *CDH1*, *hMLH1*, *p16*, *DAP-K*, *RASSF1*, and *RUNX3*) in non-neoplastic cells derived from autopsy samples from different organs. They found in stomach only *APC* to be methylated in approximately 50% of subjects under the age of 32 years, but above the age of 44 years the methylation of *CDH1* (70%), *p16* (20%), *RASSF1A* (7%), and *RUNX3* (8%) was observed, while *hMLH1* was rarely methylated. [141] In contrast, in GCA the methylation of *RUNX3* and *hMLH1* occurred in 45% and 32%, respectively. [108,113]

Recent studies have shown that the increasing rate of promoter hypermethylation is associated with histopathological progression from gastritis to IM and adenoma, and to GCA, [139,142–144] as also reviewed by Kim et al [145] and Choi and Wu. [146] Lee at al [139] assessed concurrent methylation of *p16* and *hMLH1* genes and four CpG islands (MINT). The mean methylation index increased from 0.09 of normal/chronic gastritis to 0.16 in IM, to 0.40 in adenomas, and to 0.44 in cancer-associated

adenomas and in adenocarcinoma. The methylation of *p16* was found in 7% in IM, in 18% of adenomas, in 29% of adenocarcinoma-associated dysplasia/adenomas, and in 44% of adenocarcinomas. The results suggest a role for *p16* methylation in progression of carcinogenesis from adenoma to GCA. Similar significant increase in methylation frequencies of *p16*, *hMLH1*, thrombospondin I gene (*THBSI*), and *TIMP-3* along the multistep progression from chronic gastritis to adenoma and GCA was found in the study by Kang et al., with the exception that *p16* and *hMLH1* were not methylated in chronic gastritis. In another study by Kang et al., the analysis of five genes (*DAP-K*, *CDH1*, *p14*, *THBSI*, and *TIMP-3*) showed a progressive increase in the methylation frequency as a function of ageing. Male gender, IM, and chronic inflammation correlated positively with the increasing methylation. Kang et al. could group a set of 12 genes into five categories based on their methylation frequencies along the multistage progression of gastric carcinogenesis: i.e. (1) genes which are methylated primarily in GCA (*GSTPI*, *RASSF1A*); (2) genes with low methylation in premalignant stages, but increased in GCA (*COX-2*, *hMLH1*, and *p16*); (3) genes with constantly low methylation (*MGMT*); (4) genes with constantly high methylation (*APC*, *CDH1*); and (5) genes with increasing methylation rates culminating in GCA (*DAP-K*, *p14*, *THBSI*, and *TIMP-3*).

Taken together, the results show gene-specific susceptibility to age-related methylation, and that in gastric carcinogenesis concurrent gene methylation occurs early and progressively increases, manifesting as hypermethylation in GCA. Methylation of a particular gene in a precancerous lesion — e.g. *p16*, *hMLH1*, *COX-2*, and *RUNX3* — might serve as a biomarker for an increased risk of malignant transformation. Some of the major molecular or gene alterations in the precancerous conditions are summarized in Figure 6.

### H. pylori

Developments of chronic atrophic gastritis and IM are closely associated with *H. pylori* infection. However, the *H. pylori*-related mechanisms in the initiation and promotion of carcinogenesis are poorly understood. Complex interactions between host factors, different *H. pylori* genotypes, and exogenous or endogenous mutagenic or protective substances take place. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) from activated inflammatory cells, products of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) together with exogenous carcinogens and those produced by contaminating bacteria present in non-acidic stomach may cause DNA damage and mutations as recently reviewed by Gologan et al. However, *H. pylori* has not consistently been associated with genetic aberrations such as mutation of *TP53*, over-expression of *ERBB2* and *C-MET*, or LOH of *APC* and *DCC*, *hTERT* expression or MSI, suggesting that other mechanisms are involved. In *H. pylori* gastritis enhanced proliferation and apoptosis of epithelial cells occurs, but in IM, relative to proliferation, an attenuated rate of apoptosis has been observed. Also in IM, *H. pylori*-associated expression of the gut-specific transcription factors *CDX-1* and *CDX-2*, anti-apoptotic *COX-2*, and promitotic *hTERT* have been found.

The association between *H. pylori* gastritis and CpG island methylation of genes is unclear. The presence of *H. pylori* infection has been shown to be associated with the methylation of *CDH1* in premalignant stages but not with the methylation status in GCA. However, no significant association was found between *H. pylori* infection and gene methylation in the study by Kang et al.

CONCLUSIONS

In conclusion, despite the increasing body of data, the overall view on the molecular pathology of GCA remains fragmentary. No consistent differences in the molecular pathology of GCA according to the Laurén classification have been found. The mechanisms of chronic inflammation by *H. pylori* in the initiation of GCA most probably affect both shared and specific molecular pathways leading to either DGCA or IGCA. Classification of GCA and its precursor conditions by current molecular pathology techniques, as well as identification of high-risk individuals by these techniques, have not yet been established. The epigenetic dysregulation represents a major mechanism for altered gene expression in GCA. An emerging view is that promoter methylation is present in non-neoplastic cells as an age-related and tissue-specific phenomenon that precedes and progresses to hypermethylation in cancer. Inactivation of the DNA repair genes by promoter hypermethylation contributes to increased frequency of mutations in GCA. The analysis of hypermethylated genes such as *p16* and *hMLH1* or the methylation pattern of such genes, which indicates a field defect in premalignant conditions, is promising in predicting the risk of gastric malignancy in such individuals.
